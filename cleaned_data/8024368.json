    "text": "He must have done something bad in his past life\u2014maybe he was a thief or an Alpha supremacist or something\u2014because sixteen-year-old, brushes-his-teeth-with-two-toothbrushes Jungkook presents as an alpha. He returns from his vacation taller, broader, and surrounded by a thick cloud of alpha pheromones and the hyungs slap him on the back, grinning and cooing, \u201cour cute little Jungkookie grew up.\u201d Jimin forces himself to join them, pulls himself off of the couch in order to congratulate Jungkook but it\u2019s a slap in the face to Jimin who has only ever seen Jungkook as his \u201clittle Jungkookie,\u201d when Jimin has turned eighteen and still didn\u2019t pop his knot yet. He\u2019s seen the speculations all over the fancafe\u2014Armys threw their money in the cash pool betting on the outcome, some even going as far as to dig up the genetic tree and draw outrageously inaccurate Punnett squares that clearly confirm that Jimin was indeed homozygous recessive for the Alpha trait. They really only got the \u201chomo\u201d part right.\nEverything changes after Jungkook becomes an alpha. He starts doing weird, supposedly-alpha things like puffing his chest out all the time and collecting definitely-not-unisex scents. He gets bigger too, goes to the gym everyday to put on some size. Worst of all, he refuses to call Jimin \u201chyung\u201d. Like he doesn\u2019t take Jimin seriously anymore. Jimin just laughs and mutters, \u201cyou brat,\u201d ignoring the way his chest falls. It\u2019s different now. It\u2019s not\u00a0just Jungkook\u2019s height that changes, or his muscles that grow; he gets bolder, a little more aggressive. He also gets too attractive for his own damn good. Jimin realizes that he can\u2019t see Jungkook as a maknae anymore, but as a man.  His crush only grows from there.  When Jimin turns twenty, the cash pool empties out and Armys and Jimin both resign themselves to the fact that Jimin is, unfortunately, a beta. If Jimin were to be honest, he\u2019s okay with it because he\u2019d rather not be one of the lust-driven, hypermasculine Alphas he reads about in the \u201ctrashy omega harlequin novels\u201d (as Yoongi calls them). Somehow the beta-ness and his hyung status evens out, makes him not above, but equal to Jungkook. That\u2019s good enough for him.  But no, the ever-loving cosmos decides that Jimin deserves more than being a dime-a-dozen beta. In fact, the world thinks he\u2019s so damn special, it decides to have Jimin, at the young, young age of twenty, present as one of the 6% of omega males in the population of South Korea. Fucking fantastic. The least the world could do is to give him some how-to guide or self-help book, something like \u201cA Guide to Being an Omega Male\u201d or \u201cWhat to Do When You Present as an Omega and End Up Lusting After Your Bandmate\u201d but all the world gives him is a headache, a heartache, and too many damn hormones.\n\u00a0\nIt happens about two months after his birthday. A day like any other. They\u2019re drilling the choreography again; they\u2019re about four hours into practice and the room gets stuffy and unbearably hot, but it\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary, even when it\u2019s December and less than five degrees outside. About two hours in, Jimin starts getting a little lightheaded. It normally wouldn\u2019t be a big deal, but his body heats up more than usual and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to feel so suffocated in a flimsy cotton T-shirt. And then he feels it\u2014there\u2019s a distinct feeling of slick coming from his lower half. He almost brushes it off as the typical sweat pouring from a grueling practice, but everyone\u2019s heads whip towards him\u2014he hears a choked \u201chyung\u201d from the corner and Yoongi\u2019s staring at him like he\u2019s sprouted two heads. Beside him, Namjoon whispers with incredulity, \u201cJimin, y-you\u2019re\u2014\u201d and he doesn\u2019t need to finish because everything comes crashing to a halt and it dawns on him.  I\u2019m an omega.  Then it\u2019s like a switch is turned on and his senses are magnified a thousandfold, like he\u2019s a blind person who\u2019s regained his sight. He smells everything in the room: the sweat on their skin, the makeup on the noonas watching, Yoongi\u2019s campfire smoke, Namjoon\u2019s soft pine, and then something so, so good it makes his head reel. Before he could figure out where the scent is coming from, the room fades to black and the last thing he sees is Jungkook\u2019s wide eyes. In the background, Sungdeuk-hyung calls for one of the omega noonas.\n\u00a0\nWhen Jimin comes to, he\u2019s surrounded by mounds of blankets and pillows saturated with Hoseok\u2019s scent and he blearily looks up to see the rungs of what appears to be the bottom of his bunk. The room\u2019s bright; not from any lamps but from the gray winter light. He must have been out for a few hours at least.  Across the room, Jimin sees Taehyung\u2019s familiar lump on the bed with an arm and a head sticking out from where he\u2019s cocooned in his blanket. A thumb lazily scrolls through the phone he holds overhead.  \u201cTae?\u201d Jimin rasps, the sleep not clearing from his throat.\nTaehyung looks over at him, the surprise on his face lit up in blue light.  \u201cYou\u2019re awake!\u201d  Taehyung plops down from his bed, wraps his comforter around his shoulders and wears it like a turtle shell.\u00a0He shuffles over and squeezes himself in the little space left on the twin bed, wiggling as he makes himself comfortable.\n\u201cTae, it\u2019s hot.\u201d  Jimin whines but makes no move to push Taehyung off.  Taehyung ignores Jimin\u2019s complaints anyway, pulls Jimin into his body and crushes him to his chest.\nAs talkative as Taehyung tends to be, he never really talks about his feelings. It drives Jimin nuts sometimes, makes him think that Taehyung\u2019s just gonna burst one day, like there\u2019s going to be one breath too many and it\u2019s going to pop the balloon. Jimin\u2019s realized though, that Taehyung shows it through other ways, through a not-quite joke, through a soft touch or a small sigh.\nJimin relaxes into the hug, thankful for Taehyung\u2019s quiet comfort.  Taehyung pulls away just as fast though, eyes drooping into something more serious, the way they do when Taehyung finds out Jimin hasn\u2019t eaten all day or practiced with no break in between. Jimin wants to tickle him to get rid of it; he hates seeing that worried expression, hates the coddling that comes after it. It makes him feel weak\u2014makes him feel like he\u2019s not cut out for this industry. His grandma told him back then, that the entertainment industry was an Alpha-dominated world (as though the rest of the world isn\u2019t). Maybe she knew he\u2019d end up an omega, the only one in an all-Alpha family.  \u201cYou okay?\u201d Taehyung whispers.  \u201cYeah, it just\u2014caught me by surprise.\u201d  Taehyung snorts. Understatement of the century.  \u201cYeah, we were all pretty shocked. I mean, Namjoon-hyung was blabbing on and on about how he should\u2019ve seen it coming, like, \u2018no wonder everyone\u2019s so charmed by him\u2019 and \u2018no wonder he\u2019s so small\u2019\u2014\u201d Jimin lets out an affronted noise and Taehyung hurries, \u201c\u2014no offense, Jiminie. Anyway, it really came out of nowhere.\u201d  The fan hums lowly in the background while Jimin lets all of the information sink in. Maybe it did explain some things\u2014a lot of the older Alpha hyungs and noonas always seemed to dote on him, cooing about his charm, his \u201cnatural aegyo,\u201d and at that time, Jimin didn\u2019t think much of the attention. Namjoon had said that Jimin had some sort of je ne sais quois\u2014Jimin had no clue what the hell that meant, shrugging it off as another one of Namjoon\u2019s big, foreign words that he throws out in order to win arguments. It turns out that the je ne sais quois was his latent omega hormones. Super.  \u201cEarth to Jiminie\u2014\u201d  Taehyung pinches his nose and Jimin splutters, smacking Taehyung on the shoulder.  \u201cWhat the hell was that for?!\u201d  Taehyung retreats into his blanket cocoon but frees a hand in order to rub Jimin\u2019s forehead and Jimin relaxes, eases into his touch.  \u201cStop thinking so much,\u201d he murmurs, his thumb moving in small circles between Jimin\u2019s brows, \u201c\u2014you\u2019re going to end up like Yoongi-hyung at this rate, all bitter and pessimistic with life.\u201d  Jimin laughs, shoulders shaking, and Taehyung grins mischievously.  \u201cBetter to think too much than not at all,\u201d Jimin shoots back.  \u201cAre you insulting me?\u201d Taehyung gasps.  The big hand that was on Jimin\u2019s forehead flies to his chest and Taehyung clutches it in mock pain.  \u201cI came to comfort him and this is what I get,\u201d he laments.  Jimin rolls his eyes at Taehyung\u2019s dramatics but Taehyung just giggles, cheeks smushed up where he\u2019s burying his face into the pillow.\nThey settle into a comfortable silence and Taehyung scoots closer, nuzzling into Jimin\u2019s side like a child. Jimin\u2019s thankful that biology hasn\u2019t pitted them against each other. He\u2019d miss this too much.\nBut does that mean that things will change between him and Namjoon? Him and Yoongi? Him and Jungkook?\nThe living room door slams open then, and Jimin feels it before he smells it. The minute the door opens, the pheromones roll in like a heat wave and he breaks into a sweat. His body burns up like a fever, skin flushing, heat pooling in his gut. Jimin whines somewhere in the back of his throat and kicks at the sheets in distress. Fuck, he\u2019s burning up. It\u2019s so hot he wants to peel off his skin.\n Taehyung notices the abrupt change and shoots up, droopy eyes gone, hands hovering in the air like he\u2019s not sure whether or not to reach out to Jimin.  \u201cJimin\u2014what\u2019s going on? What\u2019s up with you?\u201d  Jimin grunts, tearing off his shirt in a daze.   \u201cH-hot.\u201d  \u201cHot? What are you talking about\u2014it\u2019s like less than 10 degrees in here\u2014\u201d  Taehyung\u2019s voice is drowned out by the pounding in his ears, but dully, Jimin hears him mutter, \"shit- shit, shit, shit\u201d before the bed dips and rises.  \u201cOUT. Get OUT.\u201d  Taehyung bellows so ferociously, it slices through the heat-fuddled haze in Jimin\u2019s head and idly, Jimin wonders who he\u2019s talking to, but he can\u2019t think for long because the heat feels so thick and heavy that Jimin feels the weight of it on his body. There\u2019s a shuffle of noise on the other side of the wall and then a deafening slam that reverberates through the whole bed.\nSlowly, the heat dulls to a low simmer.\nThe bedroom door clicks and Taehyung sighs and shuffles over, flopping down onto Jimin\u2019s bed in exasperation, muttering something about \u201cstupid Alphas\u201d and \u201cput him on a goddamn leash\u201d but Jimin\u2019s too tired to push further. He closes his eyes and sidles closer to Taehyung despite the heat, tucking his nose into Taehyung\u2019s side in order to drown out the scent that just settled in. Something sweet and warm. Like hot cocoa.\nAfter a bit of silence, Taehyung clears his throat.  \u201cUh, did you\u2026 want some alone time or something?\u201d  \u201cHm?\u201d  \u201cI can leave if you want.\u201d  Jimin opens an eye. Taehyung\u2019s staring up at the rungs, pointedly avoiding Jimin\u2019s gaze.  \u201cWhat are you even talking about?\u201d  Taehyung clears his throat again.  \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be like, crazy horny right now? Because if you are, I\u2019m gonna go.\u201d  \u201c\u2026Tae\u2026 what are you even\u2014 the fuck?\u201d  \u201c\u2014I don\u2019t know, isn\u2019t that what happens during a heat? That\u2019s like the basic premise of 70% of the porn that Namjoon watches\u2014\u201d and damned if Jimin didn\u2019t know what he was talking about, because he knows for a fact (i.e. accidentally walking in on Namjoon with his hands down his pants) that Namjoon\u2019s favorite videos involve sex-crazed female omegas begging for Alpha cock.  \u201cTaehyung, I really don\u2019t want to talk about this right now,\u201d he groans, planting his face into the pillow. \u201cAnd besides, I don\u2019t even know if that was a heat.\u201d  He doesn\u2019t think it is. He\u2019s heard about heats\u2014the way they can drive omegas insane, how they can turn them into nymphomaniacs, into incubi hungry and desperate for sex. Maybe those were just rumors spread by the old Alpha and beta population as a way to scare their children away from \u201cseductive\u201d omegas, to promote Alpha-Alpha, Alpha-beta, beta-beta monogamy or whatever, but Jimin\u2019s sure that a heat\u2014if it does exist\u2014would be more than just a kick to the thermostat. If only the world would give him a damn reference manual so he can confirm it.  \u201cJimin-ah, I have a right to know what\u2019s going on with your body at all time because if\u2014god forbid\u2014we both end up single, I\u2019m the one that\u2019s gonna have to deal with you.\u201d  Jimin groans.  \u201cDear lord, not again.\u201d  Taehyung sits up suddenly, posture comically straight, and he eeks out a high-pitched voice that\u2019s supposed to be an imitation of Jimin.  \u201cI, Park Jimin,\u201d he says, palm by his face like he\u2019s taking an oath, \u201cpromise to marry Kim Taehyung if we both don\u2019t find someone by the time we\u2019re forty.\u201d  Jimin\u2019s head throbs painfully and he\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s an aftereffect of the heat or whatever it was, or if it\u2019s just because Taehyung\u2019s an annoying piece of shit. Probably the latter.  \u201cTae,\u201d he intones. \u201cI was drunk. And besides, that\u2019s if gay marriage is even allowed by then.\u201d  Taehyung shrugs, \u201cso we\u2019ll just marry in the U.S. or something,\u201d as though he\u2019s thought about this a million times before, and honestly, nothing ever seems to faze Taehyung. Even back when Jimin drunkenly confessed that he was gay, all Taehyung did was say \u201cokay\u201d before he went on to talk about his dog again. Jimin was so dumbfounded he repeated it again, louder (much to the other diners\u2019 chagrin), clarified that \u201cTaehyung, that means I like boys,\u201d and Taehyung shot back, \u201cI know, I know, I heard you the first time, you have a crush on me, I get it.\u201d (It took a few months for Taehyung to get in his head that Jimin really, really does not have a crush on him, and even then, Jimin\u2019s not too sure.)  Taehyung reaches for him, large hand patting tap, tap, tap against his cheek.  \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world, Jiminie. So you\u2019re an omega now, so what\u2014?\u201d  Jimin sighs.  \u201cPeople are gonna treat me differently. Because I\u2019m an omega.\u201d  Taehyung hums to himself.  \u201cWell, I think you can count on us to treat you the same.\u201d\nTaehyung\u2019s a goddamn liar.\n\u00a0\n Case Study #1:  In the middle of the night, Jimin peels himself from Taehyung and stumbles to the kitchen. The cold is finally starting to settle in but the night sweats had left him dehydrated, waking him up with a parched mouth and a fog in his head. He tiptoes past Namjoon who\u2019s snoring on the couch, long limbs sprawled out on the cushions, and Jimin\u2019s chest tightens a little to see their leader exiled by night owl-Jungkook who stays up too late watching anime and listening to music.\nWith a light touch, Jimin flips on the lowest of the kitchen lights and begins searching through the cupboards for a clean mug.\nThen he smells it again, thick and cloyingly sweet. It smells like home, like his mother\u2019s hot cocoa with a splash of whiskey, and it makes his head spin.\nWhen he turns around, Jungkook is standing by the counter with his hair sticking up in all directions, staring at Jimin with a crazed look.  \u201cJungkook?\u201d he whispers, careful to not wake Namjoon up.  Jungkook\u2019s expression is wooden, words not reaching him, and he steps closer and closer with dazed eyes, pupils blown wide like he\u2019s stuck in a trance.\nJimin\u2019s heart picks up speed.  \u201cJungkook, cut it out\u2014this isn\u2019t funny,\u201d he hisses, eyes flitting over to Namjoon who shifts, disturbed but still asleep.  Jungkook takes a few more steps, backing Jimin into the sink until the edge of the counter digs into Jimin\u2019s back.\n\u201cJungkook, what the hell\u2014\u201d  And then Jungkook descends like a vulture swooping in for prey, neck bent, nose tracing the skin behind his ear, inhaling Jimin as though he\u2019s been underwater all his life and Jimin\u2019s his first breath of air. Jungkook makes a ragged, needy sound in the back of his throat, burying his nose into Jimin\u2019s neck and Jimin\u2019s so sensitive he shivers at the touch, grips the counter so hard his knuckles turn white. Jungkook\u2019s nose travels lower, so gently that Jimin has to close his eyes in order to feel it, but it\u2019s there tracing his vein like a map all the way down to his collarbones, a live-wire he feels from his spine down to his fingertips. Jungkook\u2019s smell is so overwhelming that Jimin has to breathe through his mouth. It makes his skin heat up, sends all of the blood rushing to his brain.\n\u201cJungkook,\u201d he breathes.\nJungkook continues unflinchingly, arms caging Jimin in, warm body pressed up against him from head to toe, thigh pressing close, so awfully close to him that Jimin could probably grind against it if he just\u2014\nHe shoves at Jungkook, who shakes out of his stupor.\nJungkook blinks, light coming back into his eyes as he sobers up. Expressions play across his face\u2014confusion, realization, distress.  \u201cJimin, I\u2014\u201d and then he stops himself, mumbles an apology, and flees to his room.  Jimin is left in the kitchen, disoriented, struggling to get his heart rate back to normal. Namjoon mumbles something and turns on the couch.   After a moment, Jimin crawls back into his own bed, water forgotten, hands shaking as he grabs at his sheets.  Jungkook had looked at him like he was a piece of meat; had wanted to devour him. A sick part of Jimin liked it, wanted Jungkook to claim him and eat him up (god, what the hell was wrong with him?). But then Jimin remembers the way Jungkook had looked when Jimin shoved him and brought him back to reality, remembers the panic and the distress on his face like Jungkook couldn\u2019t believe what he had done. Couldn\u2019t believe it was Jimin.  Jimin can\u2019t get Jungkook\u2019s horrified expression out of his head. It makes his chest ache.   He can\u2019t go back to sleep after that, and when he finally does manage to knock out from exhaustion, he has vivid dreams of large hands rubbing his body, gripping him everywhere, his waist, his thighs, his ass. When he wakes up, he\u2019s hard and his boxers are wet like he\u2019s thirteen and experiencing puberty all over again. He peels them off and buries them under the other clothes in his hamper, hoping to god that everyone else\u2019s nose isn\u2019t strong enough to pick up on the scent.\nHe swallows down his shame and cleans himself off in the shower.\nThe milky sweet smell of cacao doesn\u2019t seem to disappear no matter how hard he scrubs.\n\u00a0\nIn the morning, the hyungs don\u2019t greet him with pats on the back or coos of \u201cour Jiminie grew up\u201d but with some shoulder squeezes (from the alphas) and tight hugs (from the betas) that are meant to be reassuring but feel more condescending than anything.\nWhen they gather for breakfast, Namjoon says with good intention, \u201cyou know this doesn\u2019t change anything right? You\u2019re still the same Jiminie to us.\u201d\nJimin grunts around a spoonful of cereal because really, that would have been believable if Jungkook didn\u2019t refuse to look at him all morning. Even from where he\u2019s sitting he can smell Jungkook\u2019s warm sweet smell, so distinct from everyone else\u2019s, and it makes him remember the hot vivid dreams with callused hands running up and down his skin. The thought makes him flush red-hot but his stomach turns.\nJimin hates that he\u2019s been reduced to some hormonal, lovesick mess because his omega hormones decided to focus on Jungkook (Jungkook, for christ\u2019s sake)\u00a0when Jungkook can just munch on his toast like his smell doesn\u2019t make Jimin\u2019s belly ache. Maybe last night was all a dream\u2014maybe Jungkook didn\u2019t corner him in the kitchen, didn\u2019t lose himself in Jimin\u2019s scent like he imagined, because Jungkook looks entirely unaffected.\nLike Jimin didn\u2019t even exist.\n\u201cStill the same Jiminie,\u201d his ass.\n\u00a0\n\nCase Study #2\n\nFor as much muscle control and bodily awareness that Jimin has from years of dance, he still manages to trip on goddamn everything.\nUsually he trips over his own feet, falls flat on his ass and just laughs at himself while the rest of the members groan and roll their eyes at him lovingly. But this time, when he so gracefully stumbles over the cables and falls to his knees, everybody comes rushing over like he\u2019s royalty or something and it\u2019s fucking weird.\n\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m fine.\u201d  \u201cJimin, take the ice-pack.\u201d  \u201cNamjoon-hyung, I just tripped. I do it all the time.\u201d  \u201cJust put it on your damn bruise so it stops the swelling,\u201d Yoongi says, tossing the pack in his lap.  Jimin throws his hands up in exasperation.  \u201cYou guys are ridiculous.\u201d\nThey all crowd around him, pulling him up by an arm and sitting him down in the corner. It\u2019s just Jungkook that stands off to the side, staring at him, but not coddling him like the rest of the members. It kind of hurts, actually\u2014he doesn\u2019t know why. Maybe it\u2019s the omega in him wanting the Alpha\u2019s attention or some twisted sick thing like that. He tries not to think about it.\nJimin ends up having to ice his knees while the others practice the choreography. He gets antsy just watching them and he tosses the pack to the side (he needs to practice and get better, can\u2019t get left behind), but Yoongi just tells him to sit his ass back down. He does so only after he\u2019s made his voice heard, because he really is okay, goddammit, but he can\u2019t win against the members who lord their hyung status all over him (Taehyung is another story).\nWhen Taehyung asks if he needs some aspirin for the pain, Jimin nearly throws the ice-pack at him.\n\u00a0\n\nCase Study #3\n\nJimin always watches what he eats a few weeks before their comeback. He wants to look good on camera so he eases up the carbs and eats a little less.\nThis time though, it\u2019s nearly impossible because the members keep on shoveling extra food onto his plate when he\u2019s not looking. Seokjin even pretends to be filming some Eat Jin episodes in order to get Jimin to join in when come on hyung, the red light isn\u2019t even on. \nAfter Jimin catches Hoseok spooning some more rice into his bowl, he\u2019s decided he\u2019s had enough.\n\u201cHoseok-hyung. I\u2019m trying to diet.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t do that, I like you with some meat on your bones,\u201d he says over a mouthful of rice.  \u201cHyung, I\u2019m serious.\u201d  \u201cBut you\u2019re so much cuter with some fat in your cheeks!\u201d  He coos and pinches Jimin\u2019s cheeks with one hand but Jimin bats it away in annoyance.  \u201cAre you trying to fatten me up so you can eat me?!\u201d  The laughter he gets in return is a tiny bit alarming, but Yoongi cuts in for Hoseok\u2019s sake and says in that half-scolding tone of his, \u201cyou need to eat in order to get energy to practice.\u201d  The others nod in agreement and put some more meat into his bowl. As much as Jimin tries, he can\u2019t find any way to argue against them because they guilt trip him by saying how hard Seokjin worked to make dinner and god, wouldn\u2019t it be a complete waste if Jimin didn\u2019t eat his share?\nJimin grumbles and shovels more of the pork belly into his mouth. Namjoon pats him on the head and praises him with a \u201cgood boy\u201d and Jimin kind of hates the way he preens at that.\nJungkook just eats in silence.\n\u00a0\n\nCase Study #4\n\nBeing one of the 6% of omega males in South Korea means you get attention. A lot of attention.\nWhen Jungkook presented, his name was printed in the newspaper the next day, third line down in a tiny box in the entertainment section.  Jimin gets an entire page.  Hoseok points it out to him during breakfast, a blown-up photo of his grinning face printed in grayscale. Above it, big block letters read \u201cBangtan\u2019s Park Jimin presents as an omega.\u201d Hoseok reads the article aloud but Jimin has to tune out his voice halfway through because the clear invasion of privacy makes him nauseous. He doesn\u2019t want to know about the reporters that probably lurked around the entertainment studios, sniffing at the hormones in the air. Jimin remembers bumping into one last year as he was leaving BigHit, a round-faced, messy-haired man who sniffed at him and then walked away, seeing (or smelling, to be more accurate) that Jimin wasn\u2019t worth his time.  Hoseok skims through the rest of the article and then clicks his tongue.  \u201cBe careful Jimin-ah, you\u2019re gonna have a line of suitors.\u201d  Seokjin chimes in, \u201cmore like an army,\u201d and cracks up at his own joke.\nThey weren\u2019t kidding.\nAfter the article was published, gifts came flooding in: clothes mainly, but there were also a lot of questionable presents that slipped through the first security screening.\nTaehyung never lets Jimin forget about the time he shrieked and threw one of the packages into the air. In Jimin\u2019s defense, he wasn\u2019t expecting to see a 10-inch dildo in the box.  BigHit stepped up their screening process after that.\nYoongi and Namjoon always eye the gifts warily, especially the clothes, a few of which have already been worn and drenched in another Alpha\u2019s scent. Jimin is just amazed at how differently they all smell, like he\u2019s inside a perfume shop and his nose is being bombarded with different notes and oils and essences. It makes him a little lightheaded. Some smelled amazing, like fresh cut grass or spring dew or some other scent he\u2019d probably find in a Yankee Candle store. Some of them made his gag reflex kick in.\nNone of them compare to the smell of hot cocoa.  Jimin hates that it\u2019s the first thought that pops into his head.\n\u00a0\n\nCase Study #5\n\nDuring his grandma\u2019s time, entertainment industries scoped out Alphas only\u2014maybe it\u2019s because the omega population was larger back then (about ten times the size than it is now) and supply and demand and all. But there\u2019s also the stereotype that only Alphas could survive in a cruel industry like that. It\u2019s complete bullshit, but the effects of it are long-lasting since there\u2019s still a disproportionate number of Alpha idols.\nThis means there are more eyes on him than usual\u2014he might be delusional, but he feels them all watching him during the rehearsal, their gaze a hot weight on his body. Maybe it\u2019s the suit, maybe it\u2019s the new orange hair, maybe it\u2019s his stage presence. Still, Jimin can\u2019t help but to think that his biology\u2019s the correct answer. It leaves a bad taste in Jimin\u2019s mouth. He wants attention because he\u2019s good at what he does\u2014because he earned it. Not because his omega pheromones make people horny.\nBefore they go onstage, one of the newer idols sidle a little too close to him\u2014Jimin doesn\u2019t remember his name (or even his face to be honest), but he does remember the way he caged Jimin in with his body, giving Jimin no room to escape while he waxed on about how much money he has and how beautiful Jimin was and how they were meant to be. Jimin bristles, uncomfortable, not knowing if he should call him out and cause a scene or just grin and bear it until the guy leaves. Before Jimin could respond, Namjoon\u2019s already by Jimin\u2019s side, glaring the guy down. The guy rises to the challenge, cracks his neck and meets Namjoon\u2019s glare, but Namjoon grips Jimin tight and bares his teeth. After a few moments, the guy skulks away, tail between his legs.\nJimin thanks Namjoon by smacking him on the arm.  \u201cHyung, I\u2019m not some damsel in distress, I can take care of myself.\u201d  Namjoon rubs at the spot where Jimin hit him, whines like a hurt puppy.  \u201cI was just looking out for you,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to be careful around them.\u201d  \u201cWhy? Because I\u2019m an omega?\u201d Jimin spits.  Namjoon sighs. He rubs his neck with one hand, embarrassed.  \u201cJimin, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d  \u201cThen what? Did you think I was seducing him?\u201d  He knows Namjoon means well, but the words spill out before he can bite them back. He\u2019s bitter; he sees the way the betas grip their Alphas more tightly when he walks by, he hears some of the lewd comments Alphas mutter when they don\u2019t think Jimin\u2019s listening. Everyone seems to think he\u2019s some siren, luring sailors to their death.  Namjoon flinches at Jimin\u2019s harsh tone and Jimin apologizes quickly.  \u201cEveryone\u2019s treating me differently and I don\u2019t like it,\u201d he confesses quietly. \u201cI want to be liked for me.\u201d  \u201cJimin.\u201d  Jimin excuses himself and leaves before Namjoon can stop him, making his way onstage.  He gets a few glances as he heads up; he challenges all of the leers with a polite bow, greets them sweetly. They shamefully avert their gaze.\nAfter the performance is over, they bump into Got7 on the way down.\nNamjoon laughs loudly, bickers with Jackson while Mark and Taehyung chat happily on the side. Jimin sees Jungkook shoving at Yugyeom, doing some weird Alpha posturing where he juts out his chin and squares his shoulders. He acts like an Alpha to everybody except Jimin, like Jimin isn\u2019t even worth his time. He doesn\u2019t growl low in his belly at how cute Jimin is, the way Yoongi and Namjoon do from time to time. He doesn\u2019t initiate skinship anymore. Ever since the kitchen encounter, there\u2019s been nothing.\nWhat the hell are omega pheromones good for if the one alpha you liked wasn\u2019t even affected by them?\n\u00a0\n\"Oh, it\u2019s Jimin.\u201d  Jaebum greets him with a smile; his smudged eye makeup makes his eyes look more striking than usual. He doesn\u2019t know if Jaebum\u2019s wearing any cologne or not, but he smells good\u2014like a forest right after a spring rain. Some faint woodsy scent. Jimin can\u2019t help but smile back.\n\u201cGood job on your performance today. You looked really good up there,\u201d Jaebum says with his low voice.  \u201cOh, were you watching?\u201d Jimin grins cheekily.  \u201cIt was kind of hard not to.\u201d  Jaebum chuckles deep in his chest and some part of Jimin curls up a little, gets all shy and embarrassed. He looks at Jimin with his sharp eyes, his teasing grin almost wolfish.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bit\u2026 different somehow,\u201d he continues.  Jimin tilts his head.  \u201cWhat do you mean exactly?\u201d  Jaebum takes a step back, surveys him. His gaze trails up Jimin\u2019s body, so slow it makes Jimin flush.  \u201cI can\u2019t really put my finger on it,\u201d he says.  The lights casts a shadow on his jawline, makes it look sharper, more defined than Jimin remembers. Jimin can\u2019t help but to sneak a glance when\u00a0Jaebum folds his arms across his chest and rolls his shoulders back, looking so broad in his black suit.  \u201c\u2026you just have a different aura,\u201d Jaebum says, low in his throat.  \u201cDo I really?\u201d  \u201cYeah.\u201d   Then there\u2019s a hand on Jimin\u2019s upper back, pushing him slightly. Jungkook looks down at him.  \u201cWe have to go,\u201d he says.  Jungkook bows to acknowledge Jaebum\u2019s presence but doesn\u2019t stay to make conversation. He makes his way over to Namjoon who\u2019s still talking to Jackson. Namjoon\u2019s eyes keep flitting over to Jimin even while he\u2019s talking. Yoongi stands beside them, less abashed about his gaze. Maybe being an omega also means you\u2019re a teenage girl with two dads who chaperon every interaction, who knows.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you later?\u201d  Jimin refocuses his attention to Jaebum who offers a disarming smile.  \u201cHit me up sometime,\u201d he adds.  He pulls Jimin in for a hug, his muscles firm and warm against Jimin\u2019s body. It might just be Jimin\u2019s imagination but he swears Jaebum sniffs him a little.\n\u201cJimin-hyung.\u201d  Jungkook hasn\u2019t called him that in so long, it catches him off guard. Jaebum nods at them both and leaves with the other Got7 members.  When Jaebum\u2019s out of sight, Jungkook says, \u201cyou should be careful.\u201d  Jimin bristles. It sounds more condescending from Jungkook than it did from Namjoon. Like Jungkook can\u2019t take him seriously, treating him like a child despite the fact that Jungkook\u2019s younger.  \u201cBecause I\u2019m an omega?\u201d Jimin bites.  Jungkook\u2019s jaw stiffens and he stares Jimin down. Jimin refuses to give in, meets Jungkook with his own steady gaze.  \u201cYeah,\u201d Jungkook says lowly.  Without another word, Jungkook heads to the van.\nFuck it, omega pheromones or not, Jimin\u2019s going to show him just how much of an Alpha he can be.\nWhen Jimin was five, he learned that boys and girls were different, learned it the hard way when he accidentally played too rough with a girl in kindergarten and the teacher scolded \u201cJimin, that\u2019s inappropriate\u201d and \u201cgirls are delicate.\u201d He burst into tears, not understanding what he did wrong, why it was okay for him to play with Junho but not Soomi, why he was getting scolded when Soomi clearly started it, she pushed him down first. The teacher took one look at his tears and told him, \u201cmen don\u2019t cry\u201d. Needless to say, his exposure to the standards of masculinity started real young. It snowballed from there, baring its teeth in subtle ways, in his gym teacher\u2019s tsks when he preferred to sit on the bench, in his parents\u2019 raised eyebrows when he told them he wanted to pursue modern dance. They didn\u2019t bat an eye when Jimin wanted to do sword fighting. For whatever reason, they thought sword fighting was a lot more realistic and relevant than modern dance was when, hello, sword fighting\u2019s basically the same thing but with a sharp phallic object.\nA few years later, Jimin learned through a poorly taught sex-ed class (read: abstinence class), that it wasn\u2019t just males and females that were different, but also alphas, betas, and omegas. The teacher had only touched upon omegas briefly, with more than a little disdain, but made it clear that alphas and omegas were on complete opposite sides of the spectrum. Unfortunately, Jimin\u2019s own recent ethnographic research kind of supports the teacher\u2019s argument, says that he differs from Alphas in at least four distinct ways\u2014not including the molecular and anatomical ways of course, but let\u2019s not get into that because Jimin\u2019s sources are probably inaccurate anyway (courtesy of Namjoon\u2019s alpha/omega porn and Korea\u2019s own poor sexual education system).\nIn a nutshell, Alphas were masculine. And, as luck would have it, society claims that being a gay omega male makes Jimin as far removed from masculinity as possible. So of course, the only way for anybody (Jungkook, his mind offers) to take him seriously is if he became a manly, take-no-shit-from-anybody Alpha.\nEasy.\nUnfortunately for him and his efforts in reclaiming his manhood, his dignity, and subsequently his hyung status, what Jimin has in mind goes completely against everyone else\u2019s plans for him.\n\nTrial #1:\nHis size is apparently a dead giveaway for his non-Alphaness.\nIt makes no sense because Yoongi isn\u2019t much taller than him, but the universe has also given Yoongi athletic skills and a deep husky voice\u2014neither of which Jimin has. The coordination that Jimin\u2019s gotten from dance doesn\u2019t transfer over to sports, so that\u2019s out of the question. And when he tries to lower his voice, all he gets is a sore throat and a few laughs from the other members. BigHit always put him on the falsetto notes anyway. Maybe they\u2019ve somehow molded his vocal cords from a young age, unwittingly played with his omega hormone receptors and altered his genome.\nWell, two can play that game. If he can\u2019t do anything to fix his voice or his athletic abilities, he could at least change his height. Sort of.\nTaehyung\u2019s the first to comment when Jimin slips in an extra insole (or two).\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2014were you always this tall?\u201d he says when he tries to rest his elbow on Jimin\u2019s shoulder only for it to crook up awkwardly. Jimin pretends not to notice and shrugs Taehyung\u2019s elbow off, scoffing, \u201cobviously. Don\u2019t tell me you just noticed now.\u201d\nTaehyung looks at him, scrutinizes something on his face, and then he says, \u201ccan I see your shoes for a second?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin blinks, caught off-guard.\n\u201cTake off your shoes.\u201d\nJimin\u2019s cheeks burn.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cJiminie-hyung.\u201d\n\u201cI said no.\u201d\nTaehyung breaks into a grin and then he tilts his head slightly, gears churning, completely unfazed. His eyes flash like he\u2019s got something planned, the way they do when he\u2019s about to jump scare Hoseok or tickle Jungkook. Jimin takes a step back out of reflex.\n\u201cYou asked for it,\u201d Taehyung singsongs.\nThe next thing Jimin knows, he\u2019s on the floor with an oof and Taehyung is straddling a leg, holding one of the shoes like a victory torch. Jimin slaps him repeatedly on the back to get him off, \u201cTae, you\u2019re crushing me,\u201d but Taehyung doesn\u2019t even wince, too used to the abuse.\n\u201cKnew it,\u201d he says, pinching one of the insoles between two fingers. He flops it around like it\u2019s a dead fish and gives Jimin the most unimpressed look.\n\u201cReally, Jiminie?\u201d\nJimin\u2019s face reddens in embarrassment and he shoves Taehyung off of his lap. \u201cWe weren\u2019t all blessed like you,\u201d he grumbles, snatching the insole and stuffing it back into one of his loafers.\nTaehyung frowns then, not replying, just sitting cross-legged in his stage outfit, watching Jimin tie his shoelaces like it\u2019s the most interesting in the world. Jimin can\u2019t get used to that yet\u2014the way everybody seems to stare at him like he\u2019s an art exhibit, entranced by his every action. When Jimin finishes knotting the laces into a tiny bow, Taehyung gets back on his feet and pulls Jimin up by a hand. He starts dusting Jimin off, circling around to brush off the rest of the invisible dirt.\n\u201cI like your height,\u201d Taehyung mutters. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun to hug when you\u2019re tall.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know, I\u2019m just as much fun to hug, tall or not.\u201d\nAs if to prove his point, Taehyung latches his arms around Jimin\u2019s waist and pulls him back into his chest. The squeeze around his stomach is so tight and sudden it makes Jimin wheeze.\n\u201cSee? You fit all wrong.\u201d Taehyung spies Jungkook sitting in the corner, occupied with his phone and ropes him in with a \u201cright, Jungkook?\u201d and Jungkook\u2019s head shoots up from where he was studiously studying his screen, eyes big and wide like a deer caught in headlights. It\u2019s endearing and cute and so not-Alpha that Jimin\u2019s chest tightens. It reminds him of his \u201cmaknae Jungkookie,\u201d of their younger days when hormones didn\u2019t turn things to shit.\n\u201cY-yeah,\u201d Jungkook replies. And then he straightens himself out and says, \u201cBut if he doesn\u2019t wear insoles, then I can\u2019t see him.\u201d\nThe fucking audacity. It\u2019s like being an omega means the two years (2130 bowls of rice) he has above Jungkook are gone.\nTaehyung cackles loudly, right in Jimin\u2019s ear, and Jimin takes the opportunity to wrench himself away from Taehyung\u2019s strong grip. He leaves with a huff, making sure to send Taehyung his best annoyed look, but all Taehyung does is give him a dopey-looking grin.\nJimin\u2019s learned the hard way that being an omega means you\u2019re as threatening as a teacup bunny.\n\nDespite Taehyung\u2019s protests, Jimin leaves the insoles in. It doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem. In fact, he\u2019s fifteen minutes away from performing, so close to getting away with it\u2014but then Hyunjoo-noona calls him with a \u201cJimin-ah\u201d from across the room, standing imposingly with an arm folded across her chest, beckoning him with her other hand. Her small red lips droop as he walks over.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she scolds with a hard voice.\nJimin blinks owlishly at her but she just quirks a well-groomed brow and flits her eyes down to his shoes. She reminds him of his mother sometimes. Maybe it\u2019s the alpha side in them both, the way their eyes seem to watch him like a hawk. Nothing ever seems to get past them.\nStill, he tries to milk it for as long as he can, answering her with a petulant, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nShe gives him a cool stare.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare lie to me, Park Jimin,\u201d she says, exactly like his mother.\nHe pouts, grumbling, \u201cwhy can\u2019t I add an extra one? It\u2019ll look fine for pictures.\u201d\nShe just quips back at him, \u201cJimin, use your height to your advantage\" \u00a0and Jimin can't suppress a scoff because what advantage? Being able to fit in small spaces? Having to jump in group photos in order to be seen? Getting picked on by the maknae?\nJimin protests, argues that the insoles aren\u2019t a big deal (seriously, it\u2019s just a few extra centimeters) but she doesn\u2019t budge, just plays with the chandelier earring peeking out from underneath her bob. After a moment, she purses her lips and says, \u201cwe\u2019re doing something differently this era.\u201d\nJimin counters, \u201cDifferent how? Like me not being allowed to wear insoles different?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she replies.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nAnd then she gives him a dead stare, tired eyes peering up from behind her dark eyeliner.\n\u201cYou really want me to spell it out for you?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Please.\u201d\nHyunjoo-noona pinches her nose bridge for a second and furrows her brows. Jimin\u2019s seen this before, when Namjoon accidentally ripped one of the stage outfits right before they went onstage, when Taehyung fidgeted too much in her makeup chair and she had to redo his eyeshadow for the fifth time. It happens when she\u2019s about to reach for a pack of smokes, when she\u2019s moments away from Hyunjoo: Uncut and Uncensored. As expected, she lets out a long, chest-heaving sigh and says, \u201cJimin-ah, you\u2019re an omega. You can\u2019t be more of an alpha than your hyung,\u201d and even without saying his name, he knows she\u2019s referring to Yoongi.\nJimin does his best to look like a kicked puppy, complains and (shamefully) tries to aegyo his way out of it. Her face softens a little (the omega pheromones do come in handy sometimes), but just when he thinks he\u2019s won her over, she sticks out a manicured hand. Jimin groans and toes off his shoes.\n\nLater, he learns about the \u201cadvantage\u201d on Twitter, when he sees Armys squealing about how small (underlined, bolded, in all caps) he looks standing next to Namjoon and Taehyung and Jungkook. Jimin\u2019s not that much smaller (it\u2019s just a few centimeters for crying out loud), but it must fuel some protectiveness instincts in everybody because all he sees is the word \u201cprecious\u201d and \u201ccute,\u201d and, well, if it makes the fans happy, he\u2019ll work with it.\n\nTrial #2:\nSince he can\u2019t fix his height (or his vocal cords, or his tiny hands, or his goddamn genetics), he can at least put on some muscle. Bulking up would be a straight shot to manhood. Nobody can mistake him for an omega if he looked like he stepped off of the front page of a Men\u2019s Health magazine.\nIt\u2019s too bad the universe chooses to leave out one tiny detail:\nOmega hormones have an adverse effect on muscle mass. (And facial hair. But it was already pretty hard for him to grow it out before the omega hormones hit, so maybe it\u2019s just a Jimin-thing.)\nHe notices this inconvenient little fact about a month or so into his new lifting routine, when Jungkook seems to grow biceps at twice the rate that he is. It\u2019s really unfair, especially since Jimin takes his diet much more seriously than Jungkook does (the kid practically lives on junk food). Jungkook can eat nothing but bags of Banana Kick and still bench press more than Jimin can on a good day. At this point, Jimin doesn\u2019t even care about getting the same body as \u201cmuscle pig Jungkook\u201d anymore. He\u2019d be content with getting his debut muscles back, as fluffy as it made him feel. Unfortunately for him, debut Jimin was young and yet to be pumped full of omega hormones so it\u2019s ten times harder for newly-presented Jimin to get even close to No More Dream-Jimin. Right now his upper body leaves a lot to be desired, but his ass and thighs seems to grow much faster than before. Jimin tries not to think about the possible evolutionary benefits of that.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the gym\u2019s no longer a safe space for him. He didn\u2019t notice it before, when he was living a false life as a beta, but as an omega, he\u2019s come to realize that the gym is the watering hole of the Alpha community\u2014the amount of competitive tension and testosterone in the weight room practically turns the place into a college sports bar. Which means the minute Jimin steps foot into the gym, it\u2019s like a rabbit walking into a wolf den. The grunts get ten times louder and everyone starts flexing in the mirror like they're bodybuilders.\nThis time, Jimin ignores all of the eyes on him and makes his way over to the squat rack, only for the top-heavy, beanie-wearing Alpha on the nearby machine to approach him. Without asking, the guy puts the plates on the barbell for him, slides the green 10KG ones on both sides and Jimin\u2019s right eyebrow twitches because he could lift at least four of those, thank you very much.\n\u201cAre you gonna do my workout for me too?\u201d Jimin blurts, hiding his annoyance behind a smile.\nThe guy has the decency to flush a little at least, and he mutters, \u201cI just thought it\u2019d be nice to help out. Don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d\nJimin chirps a \u201cthanks,\u201d forces a grin and then puts on two extra plates on either side.\nThe guy keeps on talking though, leaning against the rungs of the power rack with an arm propped up, obviously flexing as he chats Jimin up. Jimin answers politely and gives the guy half-hearted laughs while he gets himself situated underneath the barbell, trying to tune out the guy\u2019s humble-brags about \u201cpowerlifting on the side\u201d and being able to \u201cbench twice your weight if you wanna try\u201d. Before Jimin could even start on his set, another\u00a0Alpha in the power rack beside him comes lumbering over, black-gray tattoo peeking through the armhole of his muscle tee.\n\u201cThis guy botherin\u2019 ya?\u201d he asks Jimin, head jerking towards the guy with the beanie. Jimin doesn\u2019t even have a chance to say anything before the other guy snarls back, \u201cI was just helping him out, what\u2019s your problem?\u201d\nTattoo guy takes it as a threat, growls and shoulders himself forward. \u201cSeems like you were bothering him to me.\u201d\nTheir chests both puff out as they size each other up and Jimin\u2019s reminded of a nature documentary he saw when he was young, of some male elephant seals wailing and thrashing their bumbling bodies against each other. Jimin always thought the clumsy flailing looked ridiculous, like hippos trying to do ballet, but the monotone humdrum of the narrator said that the fighting always ended in death.\nWith a resigned sigh, Jimin heads to the next empty squat rack, ignoring the stupid display of dominance behind him. He hitches the plates onto the barbell, clips them in place and then starts on his set, only for the sound of bickering to stop. Jimin looks up from where he\u2019s squatting to see the two of them surreptitiously staring at his ass in the reflection of the mirror.\n\nOh for the love of\u2014\n\n\u201cJimin-hyung.\u201d\nAnd of course, it\u2019s Jungkook, who has a penchant for showing up at the most inconvenient times.\n\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d he grunts, securing the bar back onto the rack.\nJungkook just shrugs and rubs the back of his head with an arm but then drops it quickly as though he caught himself doing something he wasn\u2019t supposed to. He rolls his shoulders back and says nonchalantly, \u201cjust thought you\u2019d want a spotter or something.\u201d He looks entirely non-threatening in his large T-shirt and baggy gym shorts, but his presence is enough to deter the other Alphas who leave the squat rack to look for some easier prey. Thank god for the little things.\n\u201cI\u2019m good, thanks,\u201d Jimin says, settling back under the barbell.\nJungkook looks lost for a minute, his head whipping around as though he\u2019s not sure what to do with himself. He nods and leaves, only to return shortly after with a pair of dumbbells that he uses for some bicep curls. He sets them down on the floor first, shakes his arms out before he picks them back up and starts on his set, huffing with every rep, contracting his biceps slowly, neck and jaw tensing as he lifts the dumbbells. Jimin pointedly ignores the fact that Jungkook\u2019s curling 30\u2019s which is almost twice the weight of the ones that Jimin normally uses.\nJimin is four reps in when he realizes he\u2019s stopped watching his own form in the mirror and is instead entranced by the way Jungkook\u2019s arm muscles flex and the way his veins pop out in blue-green rivers down his forearms. Jimin almost fails pushing the weight back up because his body feels weak and loose-limbed all of a sudden. He can\u2019t tell if the heat in his chest is arousal or jealousy or what, but he does know that Jungkook\u2019s presence is distracting. Jimin\u2019s not a child for god\u2019s sake, Jungkook doesn\u2019t need to stand right beside him, Jimin can survive without a chaperone at the gym because he\u2019s clearly been doing that for the past five years of his life. And yet, Jungkook has been making it a point to go at the same time Jimin\u2019s been going, always doing his own thing but never really staying out of sight, just hovering somewhere in Jimin\u2019s peripheral like Jimin\u2019s delicate and might break a nail or something. Jimin can deal with rude Alphas himself\u2014he doesn\u2019t need Jeon Jungkook to come to his rescue like some buff knight in shining armor. What kind of hyung would he be?\nStill, Jungkook\u2019s at least started calling Jimin \u201chyung\u201d again, started doing it about a month into Jimin\u2019s Alpha Mission, so maybe Jimin\u2019s getting a little bit closer to earning Jungkook\u2019s respect back.\nWith a breathy grunt, Jungkook switches to some shoulder raises and Jimin can\u2019t help but glance down at his hips, at the strip of skin that flashes every single time Jungkook lifts the dumbbells in front of his chest. The air around Jimin gets hotter, and Jimin feels the sweat pooling, dripping down his neck. Jungkook is far enough that Jimin can\u2019t smell him too much, but after two more sets of the shoulder raises, the velvety sweet smell of cacao gets stronger and stronger and\u2014 does physical exertion and sweat increase pheromones or something? Because the smell starts clouding his senses, blurring his vision and fogging his head, and it\u2019s too much, he can\u2019t take it, he can\u2019t even focus and he really doesn\u2019t want to learn firsthand what would happen if you put an aroused omega in a room full of testosterone-pumped Alphas.\nHalfway through his set, Jimin re-racks the barbell with a clatter and leaves. He mutters a goodbye to Jungkook but can\u2019t look him in the eye.\n\nAbout four months after starting the lifting routine, he\u2019s managed to get some of his muscles back. He\u2019s not as buff as he was during the debut years, but it\u2019s still a pretty decent size even with biology working against him.\nIt doesn\u2019t get the approval of Sunghyun-hyung or any of the other stylists.\nThey take one look at Jimin\u2019s muscles and instead of praising him, they frown.\n\u201cJimin-ah, let\u2019s go with a different image this time,\u201d Sunghyun-hyung says in his soft melodic voice.\nSungkyung-noona pokes her cheek with a tongue, eyes Jimin up and down like he\u2019s a block of clay that she\u2019s figuring out how to sculpt and she nods, agreeing with the others. \u201cYes, something softer.\u201d\nThey give him a soft fuzzy sweater, one that doesn\u2019t quite fit him, hem dipping below his waistline, sleeves blanketing his hands. He looks in the mirror and sees himself engulfed by the fabric, tiny head floating above the neckline, fingers barely peeking out underneath the sleeves. He looks like a girl who borrowed her boyfriend\u2019s sweater. What was the point of working so hard to get these damn muscles if the stylists cover them up anyway?\nWith her long nails, Hyunjoo-noona tousles his hair and makes it cover his eyes, bangs falling softly over his forehead.\n\u201cMuch better,\u201d one of the noonas coo, \u201cyou look so much cuter now.\u201d\nJimin looks over to where Jungkook\u2019s sitting, wearing a nice leather jacket that\u2019s true to his size. It makes his shoulders look good, leather stretching over his arms until Jimin can see the bit of definition there.\nJimin hates it. This is discrimination, it\u2019s got to be. Omegas have the right to be manly hyungs too.\n\u201cAw Jiminie, you look so cuuute- c\u2019mere\u2014\u201d Hoseok makes grabby hands at him from the couch and pulls him down into his lap. He pinches his cheek, pokes him everywhere with a finger and Jimin flails in his hold, trying to get away from Hoseok\u2019s wriggling fingers.\n\u201cHyung\u2014\u201d he gasps when the fingers poke at his ribcage \u201c\u2014hyung, stop- stop\u2014\u201d With a heave, he breaks free, smoothing his sweater down and glowering at Hoseok who\u2019s looking awfully smug and only a little bit disheveled. \u201cYou\u2019re not really helping me with my manly image right now.\u201d\nNamjoon says in passing, \u201cmasculinity\u2019s overrated,\u201d but Namjoon\u2019s an Alpha, what would he know?\n\nSure enough, Armys fawn over this too, loving the way he\u2019s swallowed up by the sweaters, the way the fabric makes him look soft and huggable. They rave about the \u201csweater paws,\u201d the way the sleeves drape over his fingers when he holds onto his mic. The comments say they want to eat him up because he\u2019s all cute and squishy like a rice cake, like manggaddeok, which should not be the case since he has muscles, thank you. And besides, where was this same infatuation when all of the other members wore sweaters?\nShortly after the pictures go around, Jimin starts getting boxes and boxes of sweaters in the mail, all of the clothes designer and two sizes larger than his own. The ones that smell like another alpha are tossed, largely due to Yoongi and Namjoon\u2019s complaints of it \u201cstinking up the room\u201d (which is fine since he doesn\u2019t really want to wear someone else\u2019s clothes anyway), but all of the other ones he keeps. He wears them because they\u2019re gifts from his fans and they\u2019re cozier and warmer than he\u2019d like to admit. It also gets the members to fawn over him, especially Seokjin, who rubs his face into Jimin\u2019s fuzziest sweater and calls Jimin his own personal blanket. Jimin hates the attention and loves it at the same time (stupid omega hormones messing with his brain).\nThe sweaters drop his masculinity by a few points, but who cares anyway? It\u2019s winter and the long sleeves keep his fingers warm.\n\nTrial #3:\nEven if he can get himself to look like an Alpha, he can\u2019t get himself to smell like one.\nThat\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t know what it means to smell like one exactly. They all smell so different\u2014it\u2019s like some invisible fingerprint each one of them has, a tag that allows him to recognize Alphas out on the street. He doesn\u2019t really smell anything coming from betas (and thank god for that or it\u2019d be like living in a perfume shop everyday), and from what little he learned from that abstinence class, betas can\u2019t really smell the differences between Alphas and omegas either. Even so, they at least know what smells bad to them and omegas will always, always smell good. Seokjin definitely proves that right, judging from the way he sniffs and gnaws at Jimin\u2019s shoulder like Jimin\u2019s some kind of chewtoy.\nJimin has tried smelling his own clothes, sniffed his arm to see what his own fingerprint is, but all he gets is the salty tang of sweat and skin. Apparently, everyone else gets something different because their eyes kind of glaze over when he walks by. Namjoon\u2019s one of them\u2014he dazes out when Jimin\u2019s talking and scoots closer to him when they\u2019re all sitting on the couch. Yoongi has a bit more self-control but Jimin still catches him staring at him from time to time. He catches Jungkook watching him the least, but when he\u2019s lucky, the fancams show Jungkook's big eyes peering at him from the sidelines. He doubt it means anything though.\n\nJimin remembers to ask the members about his scent when they\u2019re all gathered around a camera screen after some group photos. Namjoon ends up bumping right into Jimin and smothering him with his looming figure and normally Jimin doesn\u2019t mind all the skinship, but three Alpha scents in one contained space is a little overwhelming, especially since Jungkook\u2019s chocolate is already muddling his senses and Namjoon\u2019s heavy pine just keeps getting stronger and stronger for some reason. It\u2019s like someone waved the scent right in Jimin\u2019s face. When Jimin hears a clear sniff right above his head, he instinctively jerks up from where he\u2019s kneeling and the top of his head bashes against Namjoon\u2019s jaw. Namjoon recoils with a whiny \u201cow\u201d.\n\u201cNamjoon-hyung, what were you even doing?\u201d Jimin grunts, rubbing the sore spot on his head.\nNamjoon looks away sheepishly, the ruddiness of his cheeks matching the red of the impact blooming on his jaw.\n\u201cSorry. That was kind of weird. You just smelled good.\u201d\nNamjoon gives him an embarrassed grin and then pats Jimin\u00a0on the head apologetically, being careful not to press too hard on the crest of his skull.\nLater, Jimin pulls Namjoon aside. Namjoon\u2019s eyebrows draw together in concern when he sees the way Jimin\u2019s fidgeting with his sleeves and Jimin doesn\u2019t even know why he\u2019s so nervous\u2014it\u2019s not like they\u2019re discussing sex or porn or something. Get yourself together Jimin, stop acting like an omega.\n\u201cHyung,\u201d he forces out, \u201cwhat do I smell like?\u201d\nFor someone who spouts about sex positivity and can watch porn in public without batting an eyelid, Namjoon gets a little red in the face. He can\u2019t even look Jimin in the eye, just scratches his jaw with a hand and mumbles, \u201cI can\u2019t really explain it. You just smell good. Really good.\u201d\nJimin\u2019s not satisfied with the answer because duh, he figured that out himself when he had to push away the third camera guy that got a little too close.\n\u201cBut good like what? Cologne good? Laundry detergent good?\u201d\nNamjoon huffs. \u201cGod- Jiminie, you\u2019re really putting me on the spot here.\u201d\nHe sucks his cheeks in and then after a bit, he says in a strained voice, \u201cyou smell like\u2026 caramel. Or like milk candy. The kind that Sungkyung-noona usually keeps in her purse.\u201d\n\nGreat, so he\u2019s basically a walking bakery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than that though,\u201d Namjoon continues, rubbing the back of his neck with a large hand. His eyes dart towards the ceiling as he shuffles the words around on his tongue. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the pheromones. I don\u2019t even like those sweet smells but something about your scent\u2019s just\u2014 it\u2019s like Alphas are starving men and you\u2019re this giant buffet placed in front of them. You\u2019re kind of hard to resist.\u201d\n\u201cSo Alphas want to eat me. Got it.\u201d\nNamjoon opens his mouth to protest but then he knits his brows together.\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s not exactly wrong.\u201d\n\nThey don\u2019t sell Alpha-in-a-bottle so Jimin has to improvise. He douses himself in cologne that should at least blur out the blinking billboard sign that flashes \u201ceat me, I\u2019m an omega\u201d to any Alpha within smelling distance of him. The cologne definitely smells like man, like a smelly potpourri of musk, patchouli and the inside of the men\u2019s locker room, all packaged in a sleek black bottle.\nIt doesn\u2019t work. The oils don\u2019t counteract his intrinsic omega-ness. All it does is make Jungkook and Sungkyung-noona sneeze. Hyunjoo-noona grabs him by the wrist when he goes a little overboard with the spray one day, nails digging into his arm as she pleads, \u201cno more cologne.\u201d\nAfter her insistence that the staff are gonna have to swallow allergy medicine by the handful, Jimin throws the bottle away.\n\nJimin asks Yoongi about his scent a few days later when Jimin ends up lying on the couch next to him, waiting for the shower to open up. With each passing minute Jimin\u2019s eyelids are growing heavier and heavier. It takes all of his willpower to keep his eyes open; any longer and he might just knock out right here on Yoongi\u2019s shoulder, shower or not. He blames it on the calming scent of Yoongi\u2019s smoke and teakwood that wraps around his body, lulling him to sleep. Ever since he presented, he feels different around Yoongi and Namjoon\u2014they have a comfort to them that Hoseok and Seokjin, and even Taehyung don\u2019t have. It\u2019s probably the Alpha pheromones soothing the restless omega blood inside of him (stupid biology), but if that\u2019s the case, then he shouldn\u2019t be feeling this jittery nervousness around Jungkook. His head shouldn\u2019t be cloudy at the smell of him and his body shouldn\u2019t feel so hot and cold all at once.\nRight when Jimin\u2019s about to doze off, he feels a nose digging into his temples and a sniff that happens with no stealth whatsoever. It jolts him awake and he jerks away from Yoongi, laughing with embarrassed shock.\n\u201cHyung, were you\u2026 were you sniffing me?\u201d Jimin rubs the side of his head absently, still feeling the warm imprint of Yoongi\u2019s nose on the side of his skull.\nYoongi squints and has the nerve to look affronted.\n\u201cI was just rubbing my snot on you, don\u2019t feel so flattered.\u201d\nJimin knows it\u2019s bullshit but he lets it slide\u2014\n\u201cSo what do I smell like, anyway?\u201d\n\u2014kind of.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Yoongi grumbles, \u201cI\u2019m sick and I can\u2019t smell a thing.\u201d\nJimin whacks him with one of the sofa pillows.\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a liar. You were just fine at dinner.\u201d\n\u201cI mean it, my nose is all stuffed up.\u201d\nYoongi coughs exaggeratedly.\n\u201cSee?\u201d He throws in an extra cough. \u201cI\u2019m sick.\u201d\n\u201cHyung, that\u2019s a cough. If you were really sick\u2014\u201d\nThe bathroom door clicks open then and Yoongi springs up with a jerky movement, exclaiming, \u201cshower\u2019s open, I\u2019m next.\u201d\nJimin shouts after him, \u201cdon\u2019t shower too long or you\u2019ll get sick!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m already sick!\u201d Yoongi yells back with a very non-sick voice.\n\nJimin doesn\u2019t know he fell asleep on the couch until he\u2019s woken up by a wet towel dropped on his face, courtesy of Yoongi and his undying love for Jimin.\n\u201cYou\u2019re next,\u201d Yoongi grunts, picking the towel back up and rubbing it through his wet hair. \u201cJungkook stole your spot real quick but he\u2019ll be out in a second.\u201d\nJimin bats him away, trying to get in as much sleep as he can, but the door creaks open and Jimin forces himself to get up before anyone else steals the shower. He yawns and drags his body off of the couch, shuffling his way over to the door, still drowsy from his ineffective nap. When he bumps into Jungkook, it\u2019s like a caffeine rush hits him. He wakes up in an instant.\n\u201cSorry, hyung,\u201d Jungkook mumbles, \u201call yours.\u201d\nJimin nods dumbly and maneuvers himself around Jungkook, closing the bathroom door behind him. Big mistake. He unwittingly trapped himself in here with Jungkook\u2019s rich, milky sweetness, the scent clinging to the humidity in the air and underlying the perfume of shampoo. He must be going crazy, he must be, because Jungkook\u2019s not here but he keeps smelling this stupid chocolate smell.\nAnd then he sees it, Jungkook\u2019s white shirt swung over the towel rack, hastily stuffed in the crack between the metal bar and the wall and, fuck, he reaches for it without even realizing what he\u2019s doing. He has half a mind to berate himself\u2014a voice in his head is shouting at him, chanting Jimin, dont do it\u2014 don\u2019t do it don\u2019t do it don\u2019t do it but he does it. He fists the shirt in his hands and breathes it into his lungs. Jimin can\u2019t stop the whine that bubbles up in the back of his throat. Namjoon\u2019s and Yoongi\u2019s scent relaxes him, rolls tension off of his shoulders like a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea. But Jungkook\u2019s\u2014god, Jungkook\u2019s was like a high, like some drug pumped into his veins that got his blood rushing and set his nerves on fire. Jimin wants to bathe in the scent, wants to be covered with it and burn it into his skin. This was wrong. So fucking wrong. It takes all of Jimin\u2019s self-control to tear himself away enough to shower. It\u2019s not just an omega thing\u2014it can\u2019t be. It\u2019s a stupid-crush-on-Jungkook thing, with his omega hormones as the cherry on top.\nTen gallons of water later, Jimin finally manages to cool down. Jimin\u2019s feet and fingers are pruny by the time he emerges from the shower and he quickly towels himself off, only to get distracted again by Jungkook\u2019s shirt still hanging innocently on the towel rack.\nJimin takes one last shameful whiff and it breaks him.\n\nTrial #4\nWhen you\u2019re an idol, you have to be conscious of every single muscle movement. You watch the way you smile and control all the nervous tics of your body because you have to prepare yourself for a life on camera. After nearly three years of it, it\u2019s not hard for Jimin to fix his own body language anymore. Now he uses that knowledge, makes it a habit to catch himself doing non-Alpha things. When he notices that he\u2019s shrinking in on himself, he puffs his chest out and makes himself look bigger than he really is. He manhandles his members to show everybody that he\u2019s not a shy little omega who can get walked on. He reasserts himself with an arm slung over everyone\u2019s shoulders, never mind that Taehyung\u2019s about a head taller. He does the same to Jungkook (only after plugging his nostrils), making it clear that his position hasn\u2019t changed, omega or not.\nNo one calls him out on it, especially because a lot of it\u2019s cut from broadcast anyway, but he\u2019s pretty sure it gets Jungkook\u2019s attention because Jungkook doesn\u2019t fight it. He dutifully calls Jimin \u201chyung,\u201d doesn\u2019t look at him head-on like before. His gaze lowers every time Jimin looks at him and he pulls himself in, becomes softer, reminding Jimin of \u201cmaknae Jungkookie,\u201d and it hits Jimin like a punch in the gut because Jimin realizes this is not what he wants at all. For fuck\u2019s sake, he knew it- knew it when Jungkook hungrily breathed him in, knew it when he buried his nose in Jungkook\u2019s hanging shirt with a sob- knew it from the start, because the minute Jungkook walked through the door reeking of \u201calpha,\u201d Jimin no longer saw him as a little brother. Jimin deluded himself into thinking that\u2019s what he wanted, put on a little Alpha show thinking that he can be a hyung again, told himself that he just wanted to get Jungkook\u2019s respect as a dongsaeng back but who\u2019s he kidding? He doesn\u2019t want Jungkook to see him as a hyung or as an alpha.\nHe wants Jungkook to see him as a man.\n\nIt hits him especially hard when they\u2019re at the opening of the KBS music festival and Jungkook is joking around with Yugyeom again, shoving at Yugyeom when he says something stupid, slinging an arm around Yugyeom\u2019s shoulder. Jimin can\u2019t even pay the crowd any attention because he\u2019s too busy flitting his eyes over to them, studying their easy smiles and casual touches. Jimin\u2019s throat tightens when he watches them. It makes something in his chest constrict, squeezes the air out of his lungs, but he just can\u2019t stop looking out of some deep-seated masochism, doesn\u2019t stop watching even when his brain\u2019s taunting him, telling him look at what you can\u2019t get. The distance between hyung and dongsaeng is wide already but the distance between Alpha and omega is even wider.\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s with that face?\u201d\nThere\u2019s the smell of cool rain and a warm hand on his shoulder and Jimin tears his eyes away from Jungkook to see Jaebum standing next to him with a sharp grin.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Jimin replies with a smile, \u201cjust got distracted.\u201d\nHe must have known what Jimin was looking at because his gaze flickers over to Yugyeom and Jungkook briefly. He quirks an eyebrow and says offhandedly, \u201cthey\u2019re close, huh?\u201d\nJimin\u2019s stomach drops and he strains some words through his closed throat.\n\u201cYeah. They are.\u201d\nAnd Jaebum\u2019s throwing his arms over Jimin\u2019s shoulders, pulling Jimin into him until Jimin\u2019s back is pressed flush against his firm chest. Jimin\u2019s heart skips from shock, his blood races, not because he likes Jaebum or anything (he doesn\u2019t think), but because Jaebum walks a fine line between \u201cfamiliar alpha\u201d and \u201cstrange alpha\u201d and Jimin doesn\u2019t know how to deal with it. Jimin\u2019s used to the comfortable, domestic touches of Yoongi and Namjoon and can ignore the bawdy approaches of alphas he doesn\u2019t know, but Jaebum\u2019s neither of that and it makes him nervous. The fresh iciness of Jaebum\u2019s scent confuses him.\n\u201cHope your dads are okay with this,\u201d Jaebum whispers. The warm puff of his breath against Jimin\u2019s ear makes him shiver.\n\u201cMy dads?\u201d Jimin breathes.\n\u201cNamjoon and Yoongi-hyung,\u201d he chuckles lowly.\nThe tension eases and Jimin relaxes with a small laugh. When he glances up, sure enough, he sees Yoongi\u2019s stony face observing them from a distance. He seems to motion something to Namjoon because Namjoon turns around also, watching the two of them intently. He lifts an eyebrow but doesn\u2019t say anything.\nA few more seconds and the opening ceremony\u2019s over. When the MCs are done talking, Jaebum\u2019s hands lower to Jimin\u2019s wrists. He grips them tightly and brings Jimin\u2019s hands up to make him clap like a marionette doll and then his hands drop and the heat radiating against Jimin\u2019s back is gone. Jaebum stands in front of him smiling with teeth that look sharp and blindingly white under the stage lights.\n\u201cSee you after the show,\u201d he says, patting Jimin\u2019s arm. He dips his head and bows to Yoongi and Namjoon before he heads to the other side of the stage, tugging a distracted Yugyeom behind him.\nNamjoon sidles over once Jaebum\u2019s gone, escorting Jimin off the stage with an arm on his lower back.\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d Jimin tells him under his breath.\nNamjoon turns to him, bewildered.\n\u201cSay what?\u201d\n\u201cYou know what.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Namjoon stresses, \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI mean the lecture about protecting my virtue or something. Or staying away from dangerous alphas.\u201d\nSomething flashes across Namjoon\u2019s face, his face looks pinched for a second, but it passes so quickly Jimin might have imagined it.\nNamjoon shakes his head minutely and sighs.\n\u201cJust be careful. People are watching.\u201d\n\nPeople?\n\n\u201cThe media doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m gay,\u201d Jimin contends, \u201cit\u2019s just skinship.\u201d\nNamjoon explains, \u201cI don\u2019t mean the media.\u201d\nJimin\u2019s blood freezes. He doesn\u2019t understand. Is he caught in the middle of a courtship he doesn\u2019t know about? Does Jaebum have a jealous beta on the side?\nHe\u2019s about to ask for clarification but Namjoon just shakes his head again, guiding Jimin back to the dressing room. Jungkook glances at them when they walk in but he quickly shutters his eyes and turns the other way and Jimin willfully ignores him too, cheeks blooming with shame when he remembers the bathroom incident, the way he needily gulped in Jungkook\u2019s scent. He\u2019s going to ignore this, beat his feelings into submission if he has to. Jungkook doesn\u2019t need a shameless hyung who lusts after him because he can\u2019t get some stupid hormones under control. It\u2019d be the biggest breach of trust and Jungkook doesn\u2019t deserve that.\nAfter getting dressed, he makes up his mind and walks over to where Jungkook\u2019s sitting on the couch, stage makeup done, hair artfully styled. He\u2019s so handsome in his fuzzy sweater, Jimin can\u2019t help but to conjure up domestic fantasies of cuddles on a winter day, a mug of hot chocolate in the cold, drunken giggles from imbibing too much whiskey and Kahlua. He chases the thoughts away.\n\u201cJungkookie,\u201d he says. It feel foreign on his tongue and Jungkook must think so too because he blinks up at him, staring back with a dumbfounded face. Jimin grimaces. He shouldn\u2019t have let it come to this point. It was never supposed to be this awkward.\nJimin clears his throat and pats him on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ll do great,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one can sing Yanghwa Bridge as good as you. Not even Zion T.\u201d\nJungkook\u2019s mouth falls open but clams shut just as quick. There\u2019s a hint of a smile tugging at his lips when he says, \u201cthanks hyung,\u201d but it looks odd somehow. It looks stiff. It doesn\u2019t reach his eyes.\n\u201cGood luck on your solo too. You\u2019ll do great,\u201d Jungkook says in his smooth voice.\nJimin ruffles Jungkook\u2019s hair without even thinking and Jungkook looks up with a sad smile.\nIt\u2019s better this way.\nJungkook wakes up one night in a hot sweat\u2014his body always ran hot but something\u2019s different this time. Something\u2019s off. There\u2019s some residual shame burning deep in his gut, like he dreamed something he wasn\u2019t supposed to, and when he closes his eyes, he can see hazy snapshots of it, of some person underneath him on all fours, twitching around his cock and gasping filthy phrases. Jungkook still feels the heat of the words; his cock is hard and aching and the burn is coiling low in his belly. He just wants to get himself off, do it quick so he can go back to sleep, but when Jungkook reaches a hand down, he feels something that wasn\u2019t there before.\nHe shoots up out of bed, heart pounding, head racing, and he thinks, \u201coh my god, I\u2019m deformed, it\u2019s a tumor, I\u2019m gonna die.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not until he pulls the blankets off that he realizes what it means, and the implications of it makes his stomach roll.\nHe doesn\u2019t see it coming, never imagined it would happen to him. He\u2019s awkward and dorky and quiet and doesn\u2019t have Yoongi\u2019s stoic, masculine calmness or Namjoon\u2019s wise, quietly-commanding presence. If he had to place a bet on anybody it would have been on Jimin\u2014short-tempered, flirty Jimin whose stage presence fills up a room. But god, it\u2019s him, of course it\u2019s him, he\u2019s not called the goddamn Golden Maknae for nothing.\nNo one seems to be as surprised as he is, which makes him think that everybody seems to be in on it, like it\u2019s some elaborate prank he doesn\u2019t know about. He\u2019s just waiting on Taehyung to pop out somewhere and say \u201cgot you!\u201d as though it\u2019s a long con he\u2019s been planning for months, complete with a realistic-looking knot at the base of Jungkook\u2019s dick. (Jungkook\u2019s not going to question how it managed to get there. Taehyung could do anything he sets his mind to.)\nBut it\u2019s true. He\u2019s an Alpha. Even a fake prosthetic knot couldn\u2019t give him super smelling senses overnight. It\u2019s obvious when he wakes up and smells his father\u2019s musty scent permeating through the halls of the house. He can\u2019t smell anything from his mother or his brother, probably because they\u2019re both betas, but his dad\u2019s smell is practically soaked into the walls, penetrating the wood and marking the place as \u201chome\u201d. It\u2019s the same when Jungkook comes back to Seoul and opens the door to the dorms\u2014he\u2019s hit by the overwhelming scent of smoke and pine and figures it\u2019s the pungent scent of one of Yoongi\u2019s bath bombs, trickling in from the bathroom. It\u2019s only when Namjoon and Yoongi greet him at the door that he realizes the scents belong to them. The other hyungs pile in soon after, greeting him with hugs and pinching his cheeks. Taehyung puts him in a chokehold, gives him a noogie and growls, \u201cof course it\u2019d happen to you, you lucky brat\u201d and Jungkook laughs, elbowing Taehyung in the stomach in order to escape.\nAnd then Jungkook looks up and sees Jimin sitting on the couch, hair all mussed from sleep, pulled out of bed just for this occasion. Jimin\u2019s looking at him with an odd look on his face, like Jungkook\u2019s a lock he\u2019s trying to pick, a jigsaw puzzle he\u2019s trying to put together. His brows are furrowed, lips turned down the way they do when Sungdeuk-hyung shows them a dance move that Jimin just can\u2019t get. It\u2019s weird because Jimin\u2019s always the first to coo over him, to sing \u201cmy cute little Jungkookie\u201d and ruffle Jungkook\u2019s hair like he\u2019s a little kid. But he\u2019s not this time and Jungkook\u2019s not sure what to make of it. It feels odd. Unnerving.\n\u201cJimin-hyung. Hi,\u201d Jungkook offers. Jimin blinks and his eyes refocus, back from whatever daze he was stuck in. With a tiny shake of his head, Jimin pushes himself off of the couch.\n\u201cCongrats, Kookie,\u201d Jimin says. He pats his shoulder and something in Jungkook\u2019s stomach tightens. He had expected Jimin to throw an arm around his neck, to fawn over him like the others did, to say embarrassing, mushy things and provoke him until Jungkook gets so fed up with it he ends up shoving at Jimin in annoyance, tweaking his nipples in order to shut him up. Instead, Jungkook gets this, some half-assed congratulations, the equivalent of a gas station birthday card.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Jungkook returns with a tight grin.\nJimin gives him a half-smile, patting him on the shoulder a bit more before he excuses himself, claiming a headache he needs to sleep off. If the other hyungs think something\u2019s off, they don\u2019t mention it. They just rub Jimin\u2019s neck and tell him to sleep well.\n The next day, Bang PD-nim calls Jungkook into his office to congratulate him on his newly-found alpha status. Jungkook\u2019s sucking on the little mint candies that Bang Sihyuk keeps on his desk when the man suddenly leans forward in his seat and tells Jungkook through steepled hands that Jungkook needs to play up his alpha traits. Jungkook spends the rest of the time trying to clear mint-flavored spit from his trachea.\n\u201cAlpha idols are popular for a reason,\u201d Bang PD-nim says, handing over a box of tissues. Jungkook takes one, coughs a \u201cthank you\u201d and waves off the rest of the box. \u201cThink of it as a new image we\u2019re trying promote, for the Dark &amp; Wild era.\u201d\nEverything becomes white noise after that. He remembers nodding a few times and answering everything with \u201cyes sir\u2019s\u201d, but all he could think about was how the hell he was supposed to \u201cplay up his Alpha traits\u201d when he\u2019s probably the most defunct Alpha to have ever existed. Taehyung could be a better Alpha than he could, which is saying a lot because that guy is as domineering as a puppy, i.e. not at all. Or maybe only a bit.\nJungkook doesn\u2019t have to worry about it much longer because somehow, his body solves that issue for him.\nTaehyung is the first victim. He commits the horrible crime of interfering with Jungkook\u2019s victory when he yanked the controller out of Jungkook\u2019s hands. \u201cHyung- what the hell!\u201d\nTaehyung gleefully smashes some random buttons\u00a0and sends Jungkook\u2019s character on a misguided rampage, and when Jungkook tries to lunge for it, Taehyung just veers away from him with ease, cackling the entire time. The slow simmer of irritation starts creeping in under Jungkook\u2019s skin, bubbling and roiling until Jungkook finally feels the heat of it in his fingertips. \u201cHyung\u2014 give it back\u2014\u201d Taehyung just laughs deep in his chest, one hand keeping the gamepad out of Jungkook\u2019s reach, the other one skillfully rotating the analog stick of his own controller, leading his character to victory\u2014and Jungkook honest to god growls and bursts forward, agitated, wrestles Taehyung to the ground and forces him in a headlock.\n\u201cOkay-okay I\u2019ll stop!\u201d Taehyung gasps, kicking his legs, neck caught in the guillotine of Jungkook\u2019s arms. Taehyung doesn\u2019t sound apologetic yet so Jungkook doesn\u2019t let go, won\u2019t do it until he really regrets it.\nJimin steps out of his room at that moment, freezing when he sees them all tangled up in each other, and for some reason Jungkook\u2019s face warms up, blushing in shame, as though Jimin\u2019s about to tell him off in his mom-voice, \u201cJungkook, don\u2019t fight with your brother\u201d.\nBut Jimin just wheels himself around, spinning right back into his room and closing the door behind him, and Jungkook, stupefied, lets Taehyung go.\n\u201cThat was weird,\u201d Taehyung wheezes, massaging his neck with a hand.\nJungkook doesn\u2019t know if Taehyung\u2019s talking about him and his sudden flare of aggression or if he\u2019s talking about Jimin, but \u201cweird\u201d is definitely it.\n The \u201cweirdness\u201d manifests slowly, steadily. He catches himself jutting his chin and puffing out his chest like a peacock, finds himself addicted to certain scents and smells. His temper\u2019s cut short, his blood runs hot, and his competitive streak somehow runs even hotter, and Jungkook feels strange, foreign, like he\u2019s just inhabiting this body, like it\u2019s not him that snaps at his hyungs (it can\u2019t be, he wouldn\u2019t do that because Namjoon and Yoongi raised him with their own two hands for fuck\u2019s sake). He thinks he\u2019s going crazy because there\u2019s this wild burn at the pit of his stomach, something primal in him that flares and flames up when someone\u2019s overstepping their boundaries. He can\u2019t sleep because of it. He\u2019s scared that the embers will blaze up and erupt in a flash of heat, that it\u2019ll scorch and devour him whole.\nAnd god, the dreams. They\u2019re worse than the ones he got during puberty. They all feature him pinning someone down, marking them and pushing them into the sheets. Jungkook never sees their face, doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s a girl or a guy; it\u2019s just a lightly muscled back, shifting and flexing while Jungkook takes what he needs. It\u2019s always so rough and hard and fast and it just seems so wrong, like he\u2019s forcing someone into this, but his body betrays him and gets aroused, knot swelling up every time he dreams of it. It makes him not want to sleep at all.\nAfter another sleepless night, he brings it up to Namjoon, asks if all Alphas are holding on to this thin thread of control because he\u2019s gripping his so tight it\u2019s cutting off his circulation. Namjoon\u2019s face is fond when he explains, \u201call humans have that, Jungkook,\u201d and seriously? Everybody feels like this? Like they don\u2019t even know who they are? Don\u2019t know right from wrong, don\u2019t know if these thoughts are really theirs?\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Namjoon says, \u201cFreud says we have something called an id, it\u2019s your instinct, your impulse\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSo everyone\u2019s got this bad side? Even Mother Teresa? Even like, Gandhi or something?\u201d\nNamjoon\u2019s expression twists and he sighs wearily, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it bad. Just because it\u2019s primal doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad.\u201d\nBut somehow it feels that way, because everyone treats him differently. Jimin treats him differently. Ever since he presented, the casual, doting touches don\u2019t come. Jungkook gives it a week or two but Jimin doesn\u2019t snap out of it. He doesn\u2019t blatantly flirt with him in front of the camera as much, doesn\u2019t sing \u201cJungkookie\u201d in search of him like he used to. He never thought he was looking for Jimin\u2019s attention\u2014he just got it without even trying, it came so easily that Jungkook took it for granted. But now it\u2019s gone and Jungkook\u2019s confused, doesn\u2019t know what he did wrong.\n\u00a0\nAfter dinner, Jimin leaves with Hoseok to go to the studio, something he used to do with him, and Jungkook can\u2019t suppress his hurt.\n\u201cHyung,\u201d Jungkook says to Seokjin when they\u2019re on dishwashing duty, \u201cdo you think\u2014\u201d he reorganizes his thoughts, \u201c\u2014has Jimin-hyung said anything to you?\u201d\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d Seokjin asks, scratching his face with a gloved forearm.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Was just wondering.\u201d Jungkook lowers the temperature of the faucet when Seokjin\u2019s not looking, trying to save his skin from the pelt of the scalding water. Alpha or not, he still doesn\u2019t have Seokjin\u2019s mom hands. Seokjin doesn\u2019t even notice, just starts humming a tune that Jungkook can\u2019t make out while Jungkook shuffles the words in his mind until it becomes a little bit more coherent.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Jungkook clears his throat, \u201cdon\u2019t you think Jimin-hyung\u2019s been acting a bit weird lately?\u201d\n\u201cNot particularly.\u201d\n\u201cI mean towards me. You don\u2019t think he\u2019s any different?\u201d\nSeokjin purses his lips and looks at him with the concern of a grade school teacher. \u201cJungkook,\u201d he sighs.\nThe faucet still runs. Seokjin\u2019s nose wrinkles up, hands unmoving on the soapy plate, and then he says decisively, \u201cdon\u2019t mind him, you know he can be pretty temperamental.\u201d\nThey continue washing the dishes. Seokjin says something barely audible over the running water, it takes Jungkook a while to realize that it\u2019s directed to him, but Seokjin\u2019s eyes flit to the side and he says lowly, \u201cit might be different now that you\u2019re an Alpha. He doesn\u2019t know where he stands with you.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014then wouldn\u2019t you be the same?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s be real here,\u201d Seokjin says with a huff, \u201cyou\u2019ve always been disrespectful to me even though I\u2019m the oldest.\u201d\n\u201cNot my fault you don\u2019t act your age,\u201d Jungkook mutters, not so quietly.\nSeokjin glares and flicks soap water at Jungkook with his long fingers and Jungkook laughs, wipes his wet hands on Seokjin\u2019s sleeves and remarks, \u201cyou\u2019re just proving me right.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I put up with you,\u201d Seokjin grumbles.\nJungkook responds, a little too smug, \u201cbecause you love me,\u201d and Seokjin jabs him in the ribs with an elbow, the exasperation coming off of him in waves. \u201cPut this in the damn dishwasher,\u201d he says, which Jungkook takes as, \u201cyeah, I do love you, you brat.\u201d They finish the rest of the dishes without a word; Seokjin\u2019s back to humming that unnameable song and Jungkook\u2019s distracted, thinking over every single interaction he\u2019s had with Jimin since he presented.\n\u201cSo Jimin-hyung feels weird because I\u2019m an Alpha?\u201d Jungkook asks, breaking the silence.\nSeokjin shrugs lazily, \u201cdon\u2019t take my word for it. But yeah, I mean, you\u2019re not a kid anymore. No matter how much you act like one.\u201d\nJungkook sprays him with the sink hose in retaliation.\n The easiest way to get Jimin to talk to him is to tease him. Jungkook knows for a fact that the only thing shorter than Jimin\u2019s fingers is his temper (it gives Alphas a run for their damn money) so it\u2019s not difficult to get Jimin riled up. All Jungkook really has to do is a) forget his honorifics and b) comment on Jimin\u2019s height. It\u2019s successful at first and Jungkook can\u2019t suppress his glee, smile cramping up his cheeks because Jimin is responding and fuming cutely when Jungkook refuses to call him \u201chyung\u201d, lips pouting and feathers all ruffled. But Jungkook doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s pushed too far because one day, Jimin says in that whiny, petulant tone of his, \u201cit\u2019s like you don\u2019t even respect me anymore.\u201d Jungkook doesn\u2019t know how to respond because Jimin has this way of talking sometimes that\u2019s part-joke, part-truth\u2014the members don\u2019t know they\u2019re doing anything wrong until they poke too hard, until they shake him and Jimin bursts like a bottle under pressure, storming off only to come back half an hour later, all-smiles as though nothing even happened.\nBut he keeps doing it, keeps teasing and provoking Jimin because even that tiny bit of attention is better than nothing. The conversation doesn\u2019t flow as smoothly as before, but Jimin\u2019s not ignoring him at least. He\u2019s starting to think that Seokjin might be right after all, because Jimin keeps watching Jungkook, studying him, always catching Jungkook in the act of doing another heinously Alpha thing, commenting when Jungkook brings more nicely-scented things home, staring when Jungkook can\u2019t keep his temper in check. Seokjin\u2019s words keep resonating in his head, about Jimin not viewing him as a little kid anymore\u2014which is good, right? Because he wants Jimin to take him seriously, can\u2019t have him be the doting older brother forever. He wants them to be equals at one point. Or at least, have Jimin to view him as something a little more serious than just a \u201cdongsaeng\u201d.\nJungkook gets more than he bargained for.\nTwo years later, Park Jimin presents as an omega and what little control Jungkook has is shot to shit.\nHe just remembers running through the eight-count for the hundredth time that day, trying to sharpen his moves but unable to keep his eyes off of Jimin who\u2019s also watching him through the mirror. He tries to pull his gaze forward, focus on himself, but then he smells something, it\u2019s milky and buttery sweet and every part of his body just pricks up, electrocuted, and god where is that coming from? Yoongi must have sniffed it too because he\u2019s standing at attention and his head jerks over, turned to where\u2014 Jimin is.\n\u201cJimin, y-you\u2019re\u2014\u201d Namjoon gasps, and Jimin looks over with wide eyes and flushed cheeks, catches Jungkook\u2019s eyes briefly, and Jungkook gasps a \u201chyung\u201d without even knowing, air punched right out of his lungs.\nJimin goes down like a bridge, collapsing to his side, and Jungkook instinctively lunges for him only to be held back by a strong grip on his arm.\n\u201cDown, boy,\u201d Yoongi says, fingers digging into Jungkook\u2019s biceps. Jungkook\u2019s muscles tense up, ready to throw a punch, blood searing in his veins from being challenged, but Yoongi\u2019s grip doesn\u2019t loosen. He fixes his gaze on Jungkook, lets Jungkook play out all of the tension in his body until he finally slumps and caves in with a weary sigh.\n\u201cSungdeuk-hyung\u2019s got him.\u201d The hand that was on his bicep travels up, strong and warm, massaging the back of Jungkook\u2019s neck. \u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Yoongi says.\n But Jungkook\u2019s not. Fuck, Jungkook\u2019s not fine at all, because there\u2019s a fishhook in his stomach and he keeps getting reeled in by Jimin and his stupid, stupid smell. It happens first when he stumbles back to the dorm, feeling disoriented and completely overwhelmed when the milky sweetness hits him\u2014all he could think about was getting closer, breathing that scent in and tasting it. He\u2019s trekked across the living room without even realizing it, his consciousness lighting up only when Taehyung pops up in front of him, guarding Jimin\u2019s room with a wild look on his face, growling and bellowing at Jungkook more ferociously than a mother bear. Jungkook is so stunned he flees, tripping over his shoes on the way out.\nIn the hallway, Jungkook sags against the door, heart beating hummingbird fast. What the hell? What the hell was that? Is this what the movies and TV shows talked about? The irresistible smell of an omega?\nJungkook shakes his head, trying to clear his thoughts, forget about it, it\u2019s nothing. He heads back to the studio to kill some time.\n In the middle of the night, it happens again. He hears a door creak open and then he\u2019s pulled away from his laptop because this stupid smell just hits him like a ton of bricks, bypassing his nose and going straight for his blood. He can\u2019t think of anything except for getting more and more of that high, tears himself out of bed like a chainsmoker needing another cigarette. And then he blacks out, his body\u2019s just moving on pure instinct, moving on that stupid fucking id, hunting down that sweetness until he finds it in the form of Park Jimin reaching for a mug in the kitchen. He must have made a noise because Jimin turns around, eyes wide and pretty lips parted in surprise, and something about him and that smell of his just drives Jungkook nuts. Jimin\u2019s brows furrow and he says something, some muffle of noise that just flies past Jungkook\u2019s ear, he doesn\u2019t know what Jimin\u2019s saying but his cute Busan lilt draws Jungkook closer like a moth to a flame and Jungkook wants to hear it moan, hear it scream, wants to eat Jimin up and swallow him whole. Jungkook\u2019s drugged-out body steps closer, only content when it\u2019s finally pressed up against Jimin\u2019s heat, when the sugar and cream of Jimin\u2019s scent is so concentrated Jungkook can gag on it. He breathes Jimin in, from the base of his ear all the way down, drinking up the milky syrup, burying his nose in that scent until it\u2019s imprinted in every nook and crevice of his mind. The body underneath him shudders and the embers in Jungkook\u2019s gut catches fire. Jungkook wants to take that body apart, wants it trembling beneath him and begging for Jungkook to wreck it\u2014\nThere\u2019s a firm shove against his chest and the world reorganizes itself in a flash of white light. Jimin\u2019s in front of him looking flushed and disheveled and scared, and Jungkook feels sick to his stomach. He stifles all of his alpha instincts telling him to mark Jimin, to see just how far down that pretty little blush goes\u2014and Jungkook does the most non-alpha thing ever and flees. Again.\n Jungkook wants to apologize but doesn\u2019t know how to do it, so he does the next best thing and pretends like nothing ever happened.\nIt\u2019s impossible.\nIt\u2019s like his brain finally has a face to match up to the headless bodies in his dreams\u2014it\u2019s not just faceless people he\u2019s fucking anymore, it\u2019s Jimin. As in, Park Jimin, his hyung, his bandmate, the person he\u2019s known for over three years, who has seen Jungkook hit puberty with a fucking sledgehammer, not once, but twice. Every morning, he wakes up hard and ashamed and aroused as all hell because it\u2019s not just a body anymore, it\u2019s Jimin with his intoxicating scent, legs spread, cheeks flushed, sweet voice begging for Jungkook to break him.\nJungkook can\u2019t even look Jimin in the eye, too ashamed of his thoughts, chest swollen and tight from the guilt. He can\u2019t think of Jimin like this. Jimin looked traumatized, he pushed Jungkook away, for fuck\u2019s sake. That was so wrong of him to do, wrong wrong wrong.\n\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d\nA nudge at his ribs jolts him out of his thoughts and Jungkook catches Seokjin\u2019s eyes briefly. Seokjin lifts an eyebrow, chopsticks dangling from his mouth, but Jungkook\u2019s attention gets stolen by Hoseok who\u2019s cooing and pinching Jimin\u2019s cheeks across the table. Beside him, Yoongi is transferring some pork belly from his own bowl to Jimin\u2019s, and some part of Jungkook gets irritated, wants them to cut it out\u2014and what the hell, did he seriously just think that?\n\u201cJungkook\u2014\u201d Seokjin hisses, elbowing him again.\n\u201cYeah, sorry, \u2018m fine.\u201d\nSeokjin\u2019s eyes narrow in suspicion, parts his lips like he\u2019s about to say something, so Jungkook shovels some rice into his mouth even though he doesn\u2019t have an appetite. Seokjin lets out a displeased hum but returns to his earlier conversation with Namjoon and Jungkook unenthusiastically chews, swallows down the clump of rice with some water. Someone\u2019s gaze is on him, he thinks it\u2019s Jimin, but when he looks up, Jimin\u2019s studying the meat in his bowl.\n If he thinks he\u2019s preoccupied with Jimin, then everybody else is completely obsessed.\nEvery single day, he comes to the BigHit office to see another mountain of gifts for Jimin, snacks and clothes and jewelry and, god, let\u2019s not even talk about the dildo. That damn dildo was featured in Jungkook\u2019s dreams every night for an entire week.\nOutside of the studio, people stare and ogle at Jimin like he\u2019s the best thing placed on this earth. Jungkook had always known Jimin was handsome\u2014he has pretty eyes and full lips and this captivating energy about him that just drew everyone in\u2014but now he\u2019s straight up bait for Alphas and betas alike. Everybody\u2019s finding all sorts of reasons to get close to Jimin. Seokjin buys him snacks, Taehyung and Hoseok latch onto him like baby koalas, Yoongi and Namjoon shuffle closer to Jimin whenever they get a chance, and hell, even MCs try to find any way to praise him. Heechul and Daejun even goes as far as to kiss him as \u201cpunishment,\u201d sneaky bastards. And when Jimin casually remarks that he\u2019s craving something sweet, one backup dancer literally drives home and bakes him a goddamn cake. Poor guy looked so helpless when Jimin stuck a finger in the frosting and sucked it off with relish (not that Jungkook was watching).\nMost of the attention is annoying but harmless. But some of them look at Jimin like he\u2019s a piece of meat and it disgusts him, Jungkook nearly punches a guy\u2019s face in when he overhears the guy remark, \u201cI wanna try out that omega ass.\u201d Namjoon has to dig his nails into Jungkook\u2019s shoulders in order to keep him grounded.\n\u201cThat guy\u2019s a piece of shit,\u201d Yoongi comments. \u201cYou\u2019d just be wasting your time.\u201d\nNamjoon lifts an all-knowing eyebrow at Jungkook but doesn\u2019t comment which is even worse because that means Jungkook\u2019s being psychoanalyzed or something. And alright, fine, Jungkook admits it\u2014what\u2019s the quote that Namjoon says all the damn time? \u201cYou hate something in him that is part of yourself?\u201d Maybe Jungkook hates the fact that he wants \u201cthat omega ass\u201d too.\nIt\u2019s not his fault. Everyone and their goddamn mother wants that omega ass, tripping over themselves trying to get Jimin\u2019s attention. The audio director\u2019s chatting him up right now; Jungkook overhears him going on in great detail about some mansion he owns in the middle of nowhere, with an infinity pool and the nicest jacuzzi Jimin\u2019s ever seen, and Jungkook gets the urge to tear Jimin away from him. There\u2019s a possessiveness clawing at the walls of his stomach, wanting him to claim Jimin and show everybody just who Jimin belongs to and\u2014what the hell, Jungkook. Jimin doesn\u2019t belong to him. He\u2019s his own person. He can flirt and talk to whoever he wants.\nJungkook heads outside to get some air, tries to ignore this unbearable tug that pulls at him every single time he\u2019s near Jimin. He\u2019s better than this, he can\u2019t be another possessive Alpha who thinks with their dick instead of their brain. He can\u2019t have a repeat of the kitchen incident\u2014his fingers are trembling just thinking about it, about how powerless he was against his own debased needs, about the horror painted on Jimin\u2019s face.\nSo Jungkook stays far, far away, hoping it\u2019s enough to quench that thirst inside of him, just gritting his teeth and watching from the sidelines.\n Jungkook learns it might be more than just alpha hormones when Jaebum comes into the picture.\nJaebum\u2019s the textbook Alpha, with intense eyes and a strong jaw and a lazy confident stride that turns heads. And when Jungkook sees him, his shoulders hunch reflexively, readying for a fight, because Jaebum just sidles up to Jimin without a single care and Jimin doesn\u2019t treat him like the rest of the alphas. He smiles and flushes a little and something about it just pisses Jungkook off. Jaebum makes the control look so easy when Jungkook can\u2019t even keep his alpha side in check. Jungkook oversteps all of Jimin\u2019s boundaries, terrifies him with his lack of control. Up against Jaebum, Jungkook\u2019s like a little kid, just wearing these alpha pheromones like daddy\u2019s suit.\n\u201cYou\u2019re being obvious.\u201d Namjoon\u2019s standing next to him with his arms folded, slicked back hair complementing his cheekbones.\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d Jungkook grits.\nNamjoon smiles that infuriating \u201cI know all\u201d smile and says, \u201cyou look like you\u2019re about to commit murder.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s that stupid id thing that you were talking about,\u201d Jungkook mutters, still watching the way Jaebum leans towards Jimin, eyes flicking up and down Jimin\u2019s body like he wants to eat him. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you doing anything? You don\u2019t feel this urge to just\u2014\u201d his fingers twitch in irritation, god, he can\u2019t even find the damn words.\n\u201cJimin might be an omega, but he\u2019s an adult.\u201d\n\u201cI know, what I\u2019m trying to say is\u2014\u201d he rubs the back of his head in frustration. \u201cDoesn\u2019t Jimin drive you crazy? I feel like his omega-ness is getting to me and I just- it makes me feel like I\u2019ve gone insane. And all of these alphas are going crazy over him too and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re jealous.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not jealous,\u201d Jungkook protests.\nNamjoon cocks his head at him and Jungkook feels the need to defend himself. \u201cIt\u2019s the alpha thing, okay?\u201d he hisses, \u201cit makes me all territorial and\u2014don\u2019t look at me like that, I know you and Yoongi can\u2019t stop sniffing him either.\u201d\nThere\u2019s some weird twinkle in Namjoon\u2019s eyes that\u2019s off-putting. \u201cYou should go save him,\u201d Namjoon says, his low voice raising like he\u2019s singing falsetto. He juts his chin over to where Jimin and Jaebum are standing, still chatting, and then he leaves before Jungkook can say anything, finding company in Jackson instead. Jungkook heads over without a second thought, shakes Namjoon\u2019s weird expression out of his head, tells Jimin that they have to go. They both look at him, skeptical, but Jungkook walks off before Jimin can protest.\nWhen Jaebum finally leaves (thank fucking finally), Jungkook makes it a point to warn Jimin. Alphas are terrible people with no self-control, especially Jungkook, and he doesn\u2019t want people treating Jimin like some sort of conquest, some piece of ass. He expects Jimin to thank him and be grateful for Jungkook\u2019s concern but Jimin just bristles, hackles rising.\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m an omega?\u201d he bites, and of course it\u2019s because he\u2019s an omega, everything would have gone just swimmingly if Jimin wasn\u2019t an omega. Jungkook wouldn\u2019t be going batshit crazy about Jimin\u2019s scent and his cute mannerisms and the fact that everyone in the damn world seems to want him, including Jungkook for some unexplainable reason.\nJimin doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate Jungkook\u2019s answer though because he scowls, upper lip curling furiously, but Jungkook just leaves before Jimin\u2019s stupid milky sweetness gets even stronger, before he gives Jimin a reason to be careful. Jimin\u2019s still glaring at him when Jungkook heads towards the van and idly, Jungkook suspects that he must have said something horribly, horribly wrong.\n When they come back, Jimin disappears to the studio with the rest of the members following him. Jungkook hugs his stomach with a hand and groans, tells them he doesn\u2019t feel too well, but Jungkook just doesn\u2019t want to go\u2014Namjoon\u2019s cheshire grin keeps flashing in his mind and he still doesn\u2019t know what he did wrong because Jimin had refused to look at him the entire car ride back. He just wants to go sleep it off, have everything correct itself when he wakes up in the morning.\nHe kicks off his shoes in a hurry to get to his bed, but on the way there, he passes by the open door of Jimin\u2019s room and his muscles tense, entire body freezing like a block of solid ice. His head turns, catching a glimpse inside, sheets rumpled and clothes strewn all over, Hoseok\u2019s side the only part not in disarray. A whiff of Jimin\u2019s scent hits him then, like sugar dissolving into his lungs, and his heart stops. Before he knows it his feet are pulling him inside, body moving in some stop-and-start motion, his head\u2019s scolding him, he can\u2019t do this, open-door policy or not, but his legs don\u2019t listen, too steadfast in its pace, stopping only when he\u2019s right by Jimin\u2019s bed.\nJungkook goes up the ladder and sinks into the mattress with the satisfied sigh of someone who\u2019s finally gotten their fix. His body slumps in relief but his fingers tremble and curl in the bedsheets\u2014he wants to tear it off the mattress and wrap it around himself like a blanket, until the scent soaks into his skin, bleeds into his veins. His head falls back onto the pillows.\n\u201c\u2026what are you doing?\u201d\nJungkook jolts awake (when did he even fall asleep?) and sees Taehyung closing the door with a hand, staring at him with raised eyebrows and, shit, this doesn\u2019t look too good. He turns away from him in shame.\n\u201cUh. I just\u2014\u201d His cheeks feel hot under Taehyung\u2019s scrutinizing gaze. \u201c\u2014I was just\u2026 looking for something. That Jimin-hyung borrowed. From me.\u201d\nTaehyung\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t change, daring him to say something, to incriminate himself in some way, and then Jungkook\u2019s pulled into this standoff with Taehyung staring him down and him staring back, he grits his teeth, refusing to chicken out even though his ears are flushing red.\n\u201cMmkay, whatever you say,\u201d Taehyung hums. He belly flops onto his bed and whips out his phone.\nJungkook swings his legs over the rungs and peeks over, gnawing on the inside of his cheek while he waits for Taehyung to say something further. He doesn\u2019t get anything other than some electronic clacking as Taehyung types something. Taehyung doesn\u2019t ever turn off the damn keyboard clicks like everyone else does\u2014like he wants some audible acknowledgment for each letter he presses. Annoying, but unapologetically Taehyung.  \u201cWhere\u2019s Jimin-hyung?\u201d\n\u201cStill at the studio,\u201d Taehyung replies, eyes not leaving his phone.\n\u201c\u2026when\u2019s he coming back?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, prob\u2019ly in like half an hour or something.\u201d\nJungkook breathes a sigh of relief and hops off the bed, trying to leave the crime scene as soon as possible, but is stopped in his tracks when Taehyung gives him a sideways glance and drawls with absolutely no subtlety, \u201cyou\u2019ve been really interested in Jimin lately.\u201d\nJungkook must have responded with a haunted look because Taehyung offers in sympathy, \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell him.\u201d\n\u201cUh. Thanks?\u201d\nTaehyung tilts his head and smiles, eyes gleaming, and Jungkook\u2019s scalp prickles. Interested in Jimin? Of course he is, Jimin\u2019s an omega for fuck\u2019s sake, and Jungkook is an Alpha with the self-restraint of a toddler.\nJungkook shakes off his unease and slinks out the door in order to avoid Taehyung\u2019s smug, knowing gaze, only to get stopped by Yoongi who\u2019s holding a mug of tea in one hand, other hand perched lightly on his headphones like he just pulled them off of his head. He raises an eyebrow and Jungkook splutters, \u201cBefore you ask\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna say anything.\u201d\n\u201cBut you were going to\u2014\u201d Jungkook scrunches his face. \u201cForget it.\u201d\nYoongi shrugs halfheartedly and puts his headphones back on before disappearing to his room. Jungkook\u2019s about to follow him but there\u2019s the rattle of a doorknob and Jimin and Namjoon appears, stumbling over each other in the entryway. They\u2019re caught up in some conversation. Jimin\u2019s giggling that sweet, high-pitched giggle of his and Namjoon\u2019s steadying him with a hand on his waist while Jimin struggles with his Timberlands, too stubborn to bend down and untie the shoes like normal people do. Namjoon\u2019s not as touchy with Jimin as Hoseok and Taehyung are, but something about that hand resting so comfortably on Jimin\u2019s waist makes Jungkook see red. Jungkook\u2019s palms start sweating; he grinds his teeth and stares at that hand with tunnel vision, can\u2019t look at anything but that damn touchy hand until he growls without even knowing. Namjoon must have heard because his head jerks up and he peers at Jungkook in interest. The hand retreats slowly, lifting in a gesture of surrender, and Jungkook\u2019s vision clears.\nJesus christ,\u00a0he just challenged Namjoon. Over\u00a0Jimin.\nHe darts his eyes over to Jimin whose face is tight, lips pressed together in annoyance, and he\u2019s not sure if Jimin caught the growl or not but the thought\u2019s enough to make him curl up in shame. He escapes to his room in a panic, breathing out only when the door\u2019s finally shut behind him. He throws himself on his bed, clenches his eyes shut to forget everything and swallows back the salt that comes when he\u2019s about to be sick.\nThe door clicks open.\n\u201cHey, you alright?\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Jungkook grits, refusing to look Namjoon in the eye.\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says. Moments later, a \u201cno.\u201d\nHis bed dips but Jungkook\u2019s turned to the wall, curled up in a fetal position. He\u2019s still fucking pissed about the hand on Jimin\u2019s waist, what the hell is wrong with him.\n\u201cYou wanna talk?\u201d the voice asks.\nJungkook can\u2019t find it in him to respond but Namjoon must know because there\u2019s a strong grip on Jungkook\u2019s shoulder, a large hand squeezing and rubbing his muscles in a poor attempt to massage him. Namjoon and Yoongi aren\u2019t always the touchiest, especially when it comes to him (maybe it\u2019s the Alpha thing) but they always give him support when he needs it. The thumb digging into his back gives him enough energy to speak.\n\u201cI hate being an Alpha,\u201d he mutters.\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cI hate it,\u201d Jungkook says again, voice muffled by the pillow. \u201cAlphas are supposed to be strong, right? The movies make them all heroes and stuff, but I just\u2014\u201d He breathes. \u201c\u2014I just feel so weak. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d\nThe hand keeps going, rubbing small circles in his back. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s just- so much anger and I just feel like a bad person all the time. I\u2019m so damn tired of it.\u201d He doesn\u2019t get any verbal response from Namjoon but the hand doesn\u2019t stop moving so Jungkook takes it as encouragement to continue.\n\u201cHyung, I was ready to fight you,\u201d he confesses, fiddling with the pillowcase. \u201cI saw your hand on Jimin\u2019s waist and I\u2014 I got so angry. All I was able to think about was moving your hand and\u2014dammit, I sound insane.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Nothing\u2019s wrong with you.\u201d Jungkook has to resist the urge to scoff. Worst fucking lie Jungkook\u2019s ever heard. \u201cHold on a second, I\u2019m gonna need some reinforcement.\u201d\nJungkook peeks over his shoulder to see Namjoon fiddling with his phone, one hand still absently stroking Jungkook\u2019s back. There\u2019s a swoosh of a text message being sent before Namjoon turns to him again, his face open and understanding, calm smile devoid of any judgment.\n\u201cHow do you deal with it? I can\u2019t- I can\u2019t just devour Jimin-hyung or something. I spent the last hour just lying in his bed and sniffing like some crazy person.\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d Namjoon says.\n\u201cYeah. Wow. How do you do this? Jimin-hyung just smells so\u2014\u201d So damn good.\n\u201cI think\u2026\u201d The door opens and Yoongi slips through. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna have Yoongi-hyung answer this for me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019re we talking about?\u201d Yoongi asks, plopping down on Namjoon\u2019s computer chair. He grabs one of Jungkook\u2019s pillows, just to have something to hold, and Jungkook feels like the entire thing just turned into some teenage girl\u2019s sleepover. Embarrassing.\nNamjoon says tellingly, \u201cJungkook. And Jimin.\u201d And Jungkook tries to ignore the way Yoongi\u2019s lip quirks in recognition.\n\u201cShoot,\u201d Yoongi says. With a sigh, Jungkook divulges everything again, trying to explain himself but leaving sentences half-finished, starting and stopping because he gets so frustrated. The only thing that keeps him going is Namjoon nodding his head emphatically with each word that Jungkook says, offering his support the way he does when Jungkook struggles to speak on-camera.\n\u201cWhoa. Lots of feelings there, kiddo,\u201d Yoongi says when Jungkook finally finishes, out of breath.\nJungkook forces a laugh but he doesn\u2019t find it funny, especially not since his well-being\u2014since\u00a0Bangtan\u2019s well-being is at stake.\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna go ahead and say what we\u2019re all thinking.\u201d\nYoongi leans over, gaze fixed on Jungkook with determination.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you like Jimin,\u201d he says bluntly.\n\u201cOh my god, hyung,\u201d Namjoon groans, rubbing his face into his palms like he can\u2019t bear to look at the mess Yoongi caused. But Jungkook doesn\u2019t even notice, doesn\u2019t hear anything past \u201clike Jimin,\u201d coldness hitting at his core.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he stammers.\nWith a low, steady voice, Namjoon says, \u201cwhat he\u2019s trying to say is that alpha hormones only go so far.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLook, Jimin smells good,\u201d there\u2019s a wince on Yoongi\u2019s face like it pains him to admit that, \u201cbut what I\u2014 what we feel towards him is different from what you\u2019re feeling.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 that\u2019s just because you\u2019re not interested in guys, right? It\u2019d be different since I\u2019m\u2014\u201d Jungkook doesn\u2019t even finish, too unnerved by their blank stares. He pulls the sheets closer to him, folding it under his armpits. Something in Namjoon\u2019s expression changes. He ruffles Jungkook\u2019s hair like a dog and in that soothing bass of his, says, \u201cit\u2019s okay,\u201d but what\u2019s okay? What are they trying to say?\n\u201cOmega or not, Jimin\u2019s like my younger brother, y\u2019know? He\u2019s cute and everything, really cute, but I\u2019m not possessive over him. I don\u2019t think of\u2026 claiming him or anything.\u201d\n\u201cSame with me,\u201d Yoongi adds.\n\u201cAnd Jungkook, I\u2026\u201d he trails off, wets his lips a little, \u201c\u2014are you sure you\u2019re not interested in Jiminie? Even before he presented, you were always sort of watching him and seeking him out. And now, you\u2019re like some jealous lover\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014you\u2019re obvious. I saw you glaring at Jaebum when he was talking to Jimin\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014and you talk about him all the time,\u201d Namjoon adds, sharing a glance with Yoongi, \u201ceven if it\u2019s to complain about him lagging or about his smell or whatever it is.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s just\u2014\u201d Jungkook can\u2019t even argue back, the realization hits him, leaves him breathless. God, was that what it was? It wasn\u2019t just his hormones?\nHe curls in tighter, knees pulled into his chest, and drags the sheet over his head in embarrassment.\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay.\u201d A hand tugs the sheet down but Jungkook throws his forearm across his cheeks in its place, trying to hide the flush rising up cheeks.\n\u201cSo you mean you don\u2019t feel anything towards him? Like you don\u2019t feel this need to- to mark him?\u201d To wreck him? Swallow him whole?\nNamjoon\u2019s back straightens and his brow furrows, pensive. \u201cThink about it this way. When you\u2019re drunk, you don\u2019t do anything outrageous, right? It\u2019s not like it makes you commit crimes or makes you want to kiss me or Yoongi or anything.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014gross.\u201d\n\u201cThe hormones are working off of some-\u201d his hand flops animatedly, \u201csome interest, at least. Romantic or otherwise.\u201d\nJungkook\u2019s dumbstruck.\n\u201cOh my god, he\u2019s- he\u2019s my hyung,\u201d Jungkook gasps. \u201cI can\u2019t just\u2014I mean, crush or whatever, I still have to control myself around him. I don\u2019t want this to\u2014\u201d he breathes, chest shuddering, \u201cI don\u2019t want this to change us.\u201d\nNamjoon gnaws on the inside of his cheek before he speaks. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019re a good kid. You\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe slapdash intervention he had with Namjoon and Yoongi was supposed to answer his questions but really, it ended up leaving him more confused than ever. After they listed all of the symptoms for his little crush, Jungkook notices just how bad he\u2019s got it. He's never realized how often he unconsciously searches Jimin out, never noticed the way he stares at Jimin, like he's studying every strand of hair on his goddamn head.\nBut nothing\u2019s ever going to happen.\nJimin just views him like a little brother.\nEven now, Seokjin\u2019s words are still ringing in his ear. The alpha hormones ruined everything. Jungkook grew too fast, couldn\u2019t control his stupid, growly predator tendencies or something, and Jimin didn\u2019t know how to deal with it\u2014that\u2019s what Jimin's inquisitive little stares were about. That\u2019s why he keeps on watching, waiting for Jungkook to pounce like a pet gone feral. It was like watching his younger brother become a monster, falling down this rabbit hole.\nWhat happened after the whole Jaebum incident only reinforces it. Jimin\u2019s been putting on this alpha facade as though he\u2019s reminding Jungkook just where he belonged. The touches are aggressive, domineering, like he\u2019s forcing Jungkook into submission, reminding Jungkook by saying, \u201cI\u2019m your hyung, right?\u201d, \u201ccall me hyung\u201d, speaking some sense into Jungkook like he\u2019s some beast, reprimanding him for all of the inappropriate thoughts he\u2019s had of them together.\nIt\u2019s a lost cause.\nJimin just views him as a little kid\u2014he can't be anything more than a dongsaeng. Jimin needs someone better than him, not the poor excuse of an Alpha he is.\nSo Jungkook swallows his pride and calls Jimin his \u201chyung,\u201d gulps down the bitterness in the back of his throat.\u00a0\nBut he can\u2019t keep his eyes from flitting over to where Jimin is, orange hair a lighthouse in a sea of black, eyes sparkling as he laughs, milky sweetness luring every single one of these goddamn Alphas towards him, especially Jaebum who\u2019s draping himself all over Jimin\u2019s goddamn back, arms flung around Jimin\u2019s neck so casually. Something about seeing them together makes his gut turn rancid. The other Alphas were annoying, but Jaebum was\u2014he was nice. Calm and confident. Good for Jimin. It makes Jungkook dislike him even more. Because Jungkook can't compare.\n\u201cHe\u2019s really popular nowadays, huh?\u201d Yugyeom asks, catching the direction of Jungkook\u2019s gaze. Jungkook responds with a grunt, doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, but Yugyeom doesn\u2019t stop. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s different somehow. Was he always this\u2026 pretty?\u201d\nPretty doesn\u2019t cut it. Jimin\u2019s not just pretty, he\u2019s captivating. He commands the attention of everybody around him, even before he was an omega, and the ones who just want to conquer him don\u2019t know the way his teeth flash when he\u2019s finally perfected a move, the way he flings himself all over when he laughs, the way he gnaws on his lip when he\u2019s deep in thought, and\u2014fuck, definitely not just hormones.\n\u201cYeah. I thought he was,\u201d Jungkook says.\n\u00a0\nEveryone claps when Jungkook comes back to the greenroom.\nNamjoon whistles through his fingers and Hoseok shouts praises from the makeup chair. Jungkook beams, cheeks pink and flushed, and Jimin can\u2019t look away. The stylist noonas usher Jungkook to the side in the midst of all the commotion, shoves some hangers in his hands and pushes him down into the nearest chair. There\u2019s a flurry of hands over his face while they fix Jungkook\u2019s makeup, sponges dabbing at his forehead, rushing to touch him up before they have to get back on stage.\nJungkook glances up in the mirror and their eyes catch. It sends a jolt through him, Jimin\u2019s heart lurches like he missed a step.\nJungkook hastily looks away and Jimin does too, ignores the nervous thrum of energy running through his body from just a small little glance. He smooths his shirt down and heads off to the corner, makes himself run through the choreography again, struggles to get his little crush under control.\n\u00a0 When they\u2019re lined up to perform, the usual adrenaline is pumping in his veins, tingling in his fingers. His hands are cold and clammy and he folds his arms, grips his biceps in a subtle attempt to wipe off the sweat. Years of performing and he still gets nervous.\nJimin drowns out the chatter of the idols around him by running through the moves in his head. He can\u2019t afford any distractions right now, not when he\u2019s about to do a solo stage, so he puts himself in the middle of the crowd with his members flanking him on all sides, his own personal wall against overzealous Alphas.\nBut then there\u2019s a presence behind him. Jimin feels the heat radiating against his back even though no one\u2019s touching him.\nA pair of hands grip his waist and Jimin stiffens. He knows who it is just from the smell alone but he turns around just to be sure, and yeah, it\u2019s Jungkook who\u2019s staring straight ahead, chin hooked over his shoulder, watching the performance onstage with a blank face like nothing\u2019s out of the ordinary.\nJimin\u2019s heart pounds in his ears. Hazily, he thinks he\u2019s swaying, or Jungkook\u2019s swaying, but he can\u2019t focus on anything except for that sweet, rich smell and his skin tingling with warmth underneath the pads of Jungkook\u2019s fingers. His entire body sags, leans back against Jungkook\u2019s firm chest and loses himself in it, lets himself relish in this heat, in Jungkook\u2019s smell that seems to blanket him. Fuck the consequences. Jimin\u2019s been trying to suppress his omega hormones for so long, he\u2019s tired of it. He\u2019s just going to give in, deal with it because that\u2019s what he\u2019s been born with. Jungkook may not like him\u2014not in the way that Jimin wants\u2014but the pheromones make it possible for a little bit. They can play pretend.\nThe song ends and the hands at his waist are gone and Jimin feels colder than ever. He blearily opens his eyes, turns around to see Jungkook avoiding his gaze, busying himself with his suit, acting like nothing even happened, like he didn\u2019t go all alpha-stupid on him just a minute ago.\nIt throws Jimin off. His heart drops, thoughts stuttering, too confused and dismayed to call Jungkook out on it. He can\u2019t find a good reason for why Alphas do half of the things they do anyway.\nJimin shakes off his daze and breathes deep in his chest, long steady breaths. He ignores the members\u2019 fleeting glances and tries to calm his body down, get his pulse under control. He needs to get used to this, it\u2019s bound to happen. Alphas are going to sniff him, his hyungs are going to dote on him, and on rare occasions, Jungkook will be touchy with him too. It doesn\u2019t mean anything.\nJimin reminds himself, repeats it like a mantra, you\u2019re an omega.\n As if he could forget. As if his body would ever let him fucking forget.\nHe\u2019s reading some webcomics on his phone when something makes him all agitated. He rearranges himself restlessly on the bed, fidgeting and tossing around until he feels at ease, blames the hard springs in his mattress for making him all achy. The room gets stuffy too, the air is both hot and cold, heat rolling in like the tides, coming and going in small bouts until the giant wave finally hits him. The sudden flash of heat leaves him breathless, makes him hunch over in his bed from the shock.\nAnd then he knows. His body burns up, droplets of sweat forming on the back of his neck, slick pooling in his briefs. His fingers twitch like they want to grasp something. He feels itchy. Irritable. All of the myths and hearsay about omega heats couldn\u2019t prepare him for this. It\u2019s like nothing he ever imagined. There\u2019s a slight dizziness in his head, like what happens when he finishes a bottle of soju by himself and stands up too quickly\u2014but he\u2019s not drunk. Not mindless enough to want anybody to fuck him, still need at least two more bottles before he\u2019ll run off into the streets and beg for alpha cock (Namjoon\u2019s porn wasn\u2019t that accurate).\nBut god, he just\u2014he feels empty. He can\u2019t even describe it, but there\u2019s this hollowness inside of him, this need to be filled. He wants someone here, wants a warm body on top of him and pinning him down and using him until he forgets how to speak. Wants somebody to stuff him up. His cock is getting hard just thinking about it. It\u2019s not what he feels before he goes to bed, not something that can be easily fixed by a quick jerk off session. The itch is deep inside of him, clawing at his gut, flooding him with fire.\nJimin tears the blanket off. It\u2019s hot, too fucking hot\u2014he can\u2019t breathe.\n\u201c\u2014Jimin. Jimin\u2014\u201d\nHis name hits him like a splash of cold water. He turns away from the wall, peers down to see Hoseok\u2019s lips droop in concern. Hoseok takes it as an invitation and steps on the frame of the lower bunk in order to reach him, pulling himself up until his arms are folded across the rungs of Jimin\u2019s bed. His brows furrow, usual grin gone.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Hoseok asks, voice hesitant but soft and soothing. \u201cDo you have a fever?\u201d\nJimin wants to laugh. He must be fucking delirious. It\u2019s a fever alright.\nA warm hand floats over him, it looks like Hoseok wants to check his temperature but Jimin doesn\u2019t want to be touched. Not right now. Not unless Hoseok can do something about it, fix the emptiness inside of him. \u201cHyung, I think- I think you should leave,\u201d he groans, shifting away from Hoseok\u2019s touch.\nThe hand stills, drops to the side.\n\u201cJimin-ah, are you\u2026?\u201d\nJimin holds his breath, doesn\u2019t want him to finish that, doesn\u2019t want to admit it.\n\u201cHoseok-hyung, please,\u201d he squeaks. His eyes are clenched so tight they hurt and he curls in, hides his red face in his arms. His hands\u00a0are trembling, palms warm and clammy, and he wants to crawl out of his own skin. When he peeks over the crook of his elbow, Hoseok\u2019s face is pinched, expression drawn tight.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get everybody else to leave. Text me if you need anything.\u201d\nHoseok raises his hand again like he\u2019s about to pet Jimin, so used to touching for comfort, a habit of his. But it retracts as quickly as it extended and Jimin\u2019s thankful that Hoseok understands, that Jimin doesn\u2019t have to spell it out for him.\nThere\u2019s a thud on the carpet and then a click of a button. The low steady whir of the fan comes on and as Hoseok exits, Jimin hears the fuss outside, the Alphas probably already smelling his slick through the crack in the door. It makes him curl in tighter, heat up even more\u2014not out of arousal this time, but shame. Namjoon\u2019s deep voice murmurs \u201cis Jimin\u2014 is he\u2014,\u201d sentences unfinished like he\u2019s too embarrassed to say it out loud. There\u2019s no verbal acknowledgment from Hoseok, at least, not what Jimin could hear\u2014but they must know because Taehyung calls out \u201cChimchim, feel better! Text me!\u201d\nSomewhere in the commotion, Seokjin asks \u201cwhere\u2019s Jungkook?,\u201d words ringing before the bedroom door finally closes, and fuck. Jungkook. Even that slight mention sends his body into overdrive, makes him drip like he\u2019s been conditioned just by hearing his name. He can just smell the cloying sweetness of his slick coming out of him, stinking up the room, and he can\u2019t stop thinking about Jungkook and his stupid scent and his goddamn muscles and those long thick fingers that would feel so fucking good inside of him, shit. He should have stolen that white shirt from the bathroom, should have stuffed it in his pillowcase, keep it here so he can breathe it in until he\u2019s dizzy. He wants that scent all over him, wants Jungkook to fuck him\u2014\nA low whine builds in the back of his throat.\nNo. He can\u2019t do this, he told himself he wouldn\u2019t. Jungkook\u2019s just his dongsaeng, just his dongsaeng, and Jimin is his hyung. Jungkook might be genetically predisposed to want him, to want an omega, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s going to want Jimin, fuck, he can\u2019t do this.\nBut the thoughts keep coming, vivid images of Jungkook grabbing him all over, large hands running up and down his sides, and Jimin\u2019s gone. When the front door slams shut, Jimin frantically pulls off his boxers, tears off his shirt and reaches down to grip at his cock. It\u2019s already hard and dripping on his stomach and he tugs on it, desperate, hands circling it and pulling from the base all the way to the tip, up and back down, again and again, but it\u2019s not enough, not fucking enough, his omega body\u00a0is wired to want more.\nHe forces his other hand down, bypassing his cock and going straight for his hole. He\u2019s experimented with this before, on the rare occasions he had both time and privacy, but it was never like this. He never felt this desperate, clawing need to have something-\u00a0someone inside of him. He wants to get fucked so bad it hurts.\nJimin can't hold back the groan when his finger dips in, breaches his entrance and rubs the slick into his skin. It\u2019s good, so fucking good, but still not enough. His fingers are too short, they can\u2019t fill him up, can\u2019t scratch the mindnumbing itch inside of him. He\u2019s losing his mind, wishes BigHit didn\u2019t throw that dildo away, he should have kept it, stupid Jimin, way to think in advance\u2014\nJimin jerks himself off quick, tries to calm down the fever by getting it out of his system, but when he finally comes, his body feels even more restless. More irritated. Like it\u2019s saying, \u201cthis isn\u2019t the alpha knot you promised me.\u201d He\u2019s never been more frustrated in his life. Maybe there\u2019s a little bit of truth in the \u201csex-crazy omega\u201d rumor after all. He\u2019s about to go insane.\nHis\u00a0phone\u00a0buzzes beside him but Jimin ignores it, tries to force another orgasm out of himself, sanity already halfway out the door. He just wants to get rid of this goddamn itch, drain all of this manic energy from his body.\nBut the vibration keeps coming, buzzing in quick succession, and Jimin bites the inside of his cheek and snarls, grabs the phone to see who the hell decided to bother him when he\u2019s so strung out of his damn mind.\nAnd it\u2019s Taehyung. Goddamn Kim Taehyung.\nFrom: Kim Taehyung (16:08) its a heat right? \u3160\u3160\u00a0 (16:08) dont forget to drink water and stuff  (16:09) feel better ChimChim~ &gt;3&lt; (16:09) im rooting for u (16:09) lemme kno when its ok to come back\nWhen Jimin\u2019s done reading, two more texts come.\nFrom: Kim Taehyung (16:11) oh if u need condoms and stuff theyre in my drawer (16:11) don\u2019t ask me where i got them. they were free and i didnt wanna throw em away  Jimin can\u2019t find the energy to respond, Taehyung\u2019s texts just suck the life out of him somehow. What the hell is Tae even saying? Who does Taehyung think he\u2019s going to use the condoms on? He doesn\u2019t even have that damn 10-inch dildo.\nFrom: Kim Taehyung (16:12) if u use my bed ur paying for dry cleaning\nJimin\u2019s brows knit together and he tosses the phone back down with a huff. Taehyung\u2019s being ridiculous. It\u2019s not like he has anybody\u2014Jungkook\u2019s out of the question, can\u2019t do Jungkook, no way\u2014and Jimin doesn\u2019t have a lot of Alpha friends he can rely on or ones that he\u2019s even remotely attracted to. The only other person he could think of is\u2014\nHe grabs his phone, desperation clouding his judgment. It takes three rings for the call to get through but when it does, Jimin can\u2019t suppress the nervous shudder that goes through him. He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s doing this.\n\u201cJimin? What\u2019s up?\u201d\nThe low velvet of his voice makes Jimin hot and Jimin remembers how hard his cock still is, the way his hole\u2019s still dripping. Jimin\u2019s hands can\u2019t stop wandering down.\n\u201cHi- uh. Hey. Do you\u2014 do you have a minute?\u201d\nHis hands don\u2019t stop moving, fingers ghosting over the head of his cock, thumb smearing precum all over the tip. His body jerks. Jimin reminds himself to put some clothes on before he lets him in, can\u2019t greet him at the door like this.\n\u201cYeah, of course. What do you need?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJungkook is in the studio when he gets the texts.\nHe usually doesn\u2019t bother checking his phone, but his legs could use some rest. He\u2019s already run through the piece for the past two hours, trying to get Jimin out of his head, and his muscles are tense, calves tightening like they\u2019re about to cramp up.\nIt\u2019s been a week since KBS Gayo passed and Jungkook can\u2019t get himself under control. He wasn\u2019t supposed to grab Jimin\u2019s waist like that, wasn\u2019t supposed to rub his cheek against Jimin\u2019s face like some\u2014some animal,\u00a0but Jimin just smelled all wrong. He smelled like Jaebum and it blew out all the circuits in Jungkook\u2019s head, made him want to pull Jimin close to him so he can fix it. When Jungkook finally came to his senses, he couldn\u2019t find it in himself to push Jimin away. He played along, memorizing the way Jimin\u2019s body seemed to brand him, the way they scalded his skin the longer he touched. Jungkook breathed in and burned Jimin\u2019s milky sweetness into his nostrils, studying every layer and note so he can recreate it in his head later, alone in his room.\nWhen the song ended, Jungkook couldn\u2019t even look at Jimin. Nothing changed. Alpha or not, Jungkook\u2019s still as awkward as ever, can\u2019t deal with confrontation unless his hormones blind him and he becomes all rage-y and growly.\nHe grabs his phone from where it\u2019s plugged into the speakers and unlocks it, plops down while the chatroom floods his screen.\nFrom: Hyung. Hobi-hyung (15:57) Jungkookie, come eat with us~ (15:57) are u at the studio??\nFrom: Hyung. Jin-hyung (15:58) come eat come eat!!!!\nNamjoon doesn\u2019t say anything in the chatroom. He sends Jungkook a direct message instead, straight to the point as always.\nFrom: Hyung. Rapmonnie-hyung (16:02) Where are you? (16:03) Don\u2019t go back to the dorm yet.  (16:03) I\u2019ll tell you later.\nAnd Jungkook's heart races, extremities growing numb from the cold trickle of fear.\nWhat's happening? What's going on?\nHe checks his other messages, sees Taehyung's and he can\u2019t shake off this unease because Taehyung\u2019s message says something completely different.\nFrom: Hyung. Taehyungie-hyung (16:06) theres a surprise for u back at the dorm lolol (16:07) r u at the studio?\nHe actually responds to Taehyung\u2014if anyone\u2019s going to tell him the truth, it\u2019d be Taehyung. Not because he\u2019s bad at keeping secrets, but because he doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s anything worth hiding.\n(16:08) yeah. (16:09) what is it?\nFrom: Hyung. Taehyungie-hyung (16:09) not telling lolol\nJungkook can\u2019t contain his annoyance, huffs even though Taehyung's not even here.\n(16:10) ...  (16:10) well can i at least head back and shower first?\nFrom: Hyung. Taehyungie-hyung (16:10) sure (16:10) \u00a0wouldnt be the worst idea lolol\nPrank or not, Taehyung\u2019s smart. He wouldn\u2019t say things just to say it\u2014his methods are unconventional, but not stupid, and Jungkook knows he (usually) has Jungkook\u2019s best interests in mind. How bad could it really be anyway? Someone probably just clogged the toilet again\u2014or burned the kitchen down. Or there\u2019s some big spider set loose in the dorm that they just can't kill (wouldn't be the first time). He should at least find out for himself.\nJungkook pulls at his shirt, uses the hem to wipe at the sweat on his forehead.\nHe could really use a shower anyway.\nHis palms are damp from the nerves, the anticipation makes his fingers numb. He can barely hold himself upright; his legs are weak, knees threatening to cave in. Even though he\u2019s changed boxers, the slick is still dripping out of him, wetting his new pair, threatening to soak through and dirty the sweatpants too. Jimin stares at himself in the mirror, sees the way his cheeks are flushed, his eyes glassy like he\u2019s been crying. Fuck, it\u2019s so obvious that he\u2019s in heat.\nJimin uses his hand as a makeshift comb, rakes his fingers through his hair, trying to fix it from where it\u2019s been molded by the pillow, dampened from his sweat.\nThe doorbell rings then, the chime echoing into the open door of the bathroom, and Jimin stiffens. The hair on his neck prickles, body jolting alert like he\u2019s a dog waiting for its owner.\nJimin fusses with his hair one more time, brushes it back with shaky hands to make himself look just a little less disheveled, and he pads over to the door, takes in one giant breath before he reaches for the doorknob.\nHe opens the door.\nJaebum looks different offstage, a little more tired without the makeup, dark eye circles a shadow underneath his pale skin\u2014but nevertheless handsome.\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Jaebum hisses. \u201cYou smell\u2014\u201d he trails off, doesn\u2019t finish it, but Jimin doesn\u2019t miss the way his eyes seem to darken, pupils blowing wide. Jimin can\u2019t help but shiver.\nHe quickly looks away, wipes his hands on the cotton of his sweats.\n\u201cUm. Hi. Come in,\u201d Jimin waves his hands in the vague direction of the dorm. \u201cSorry for the mess.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a gust of air as Jaebum passes him, Jaebum\u2019s cool scent invading his senses, so good that Jimin has to suppress a groan. It\u2019s not the dark bittersweet smell of cocoa, but it still makes his mouth water, makes the slick ooze out of him, wet and hot. Fuck.\nHe swallows down the desperation and follows Jaebum into the living room.\nFor some reason, he can\u2019t get himself to look at Jaebum\u2014as though looking at him would bring him back to reality, would wake him up and force him to realize the bad decision he\u2019s about to make. He knows he\u2019s going to regret this in the morning, when the itching is done and over, but right now, he wants it. He wants it so fucking bad.\n\u201cDo you\u2014\u201d Jimin clears his throat. \u201cDo you want anything to drink?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d\n\u201cY-you sure?\u201d He can feel the slick running down, the way his chest seems to burn. He hopes to god Jaebum can\u2019t smell it.\nJaebum\u2019s eyes flicker.\n\u201cSome water would be nice, actually,\u201d he says, voice gravelly like he\u2019s gone through a pack of cigarettes.\nJimin flees, paces over to the kitchen in a hurry. The pounding in his ears is deafening, disorienting him as he walks. He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s doing this. Really, Jimin? You\u2019re gonna let Jaebum fuck you in a dorm that you share with three other Alphas?\nHe shakes off his unease, looks for a glass on the top shelf, but as he reaches up, his mind conjures up the memory of Jungkook cornering him in the kitchen, caging him in with his body. Jimin suppresses the shudder that comes when he remembers the light trace of Jungkook\u2019s nose against his neck, the heady smell of cocoa crowding around him.\nHe takes a centering breath, tamps down the memory, forces himself to refocus his attention on the \u2018now\u2019. He\u2019s got a willing Alpha in the room next to him and here he is pining over his bandmate, Jesus.\nWhen he finally pulls himself together, he heads back to the living room.\nJaebum is glancing around their dorm like he\u2019s at a zoo, studying the organized mess on the shelves.\n\u201cHere,\u201d Jimin says.\nHe hands over the glass, jolting when Jaebum reaches for it, when his fingers graze against his Jimin\u2019s, electrocuting him. Jimin nearly drops the glass from the shock.\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\nJimin takes a seat, not on the same couch but on the armchair to the side, away from Jaebum\u2019s smell, just enough of a distance so that his head is still clear.\nHe tries to think of something to say. Doesn\u2019t look at Jaebum but stares at his trembling hands. His limbs are all jittery from the heat, his knees bouncing up and down unconsciously. He hopes to god he\u2019s not leaking through to the armchair.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one here?\u201d\nJaebum\u2019s low voice brings Jimin out of his thoughts.\n\u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s nobody here.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t wanna ask your members to help you?\u201d\nJimin looks at him in disbelief.\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014it\u2019d make things a little weird, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019d be a big deal. Any Alpha will do, right?\u201d\nHe\u2019s got to be joking. Any Alpha will do? Is that what Jaebum thinks of omegas?\nJimin\u2019s baffled, can\u2019t find anything to say, stomach hardening at the words. He might just be overreacting, maybe it\u2019s the heat that\u2019s making his temper even shorter\u2014but hearing that pisses him off. Like no matter what, he\u2019ll just be a slave to his hormones, just some desperate little omega.\nJaebum doesn\u2019t make anything of the silence. He hums, taking a sip of his water, and Jimin\u2019s leg doesn\u2019t stop bouncing. He can\u2019t help but glance over, eye the way Jaebum\u2019s adam\u2019s apple bobs as he swallows, and the heat flares, makes Jimin wipe the sweat off his forehead with a hand. When their eyes catch, Jimin quickly looks away. His body\u2019s still hot but there\u2019s an acid building, festering sour in his gut. A bad omen.\n\u201cI\u2019m flattered that you chose me though,\u201d Jaebum says further, voice a little sly. \u201cEspecially when you have so many Alphas trailing after you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jimin breathes. But he doesn\u2019t add anything else, sucks his cheeks in and keeps his mouth shut. It sounds like any other compliment, but there\u2019s something off about it, like Jaebum\u2019s really just treating him like a conquest, just something Jaebum can brag about. Jimin\u2019s heat doesn\u2019t give a damn, just wants any Alpha he can get, but he knows his shame would eat him up alive.  \u201cTo be honest, I always thought you and Jungkook had a thing.\u201d\nJimin\u2019s head shoots up, stunned, catches the stony expression on Jaebum\u2019s face.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t miss the way Jaebum\u2019s face seems to relax like he\u2019s pleased. It makes something rise up in the back of Jimin\u2019s throat, harsh and bitter.\nHim and Jungkook? A thing?\nJimin grimaces, stops that line of thinking before it gets out of control.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2014\u201d He clears his throat, wipes his palms on his sweats and gets up from his seat. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go to my room.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right behind you,\u201d Jaebum says.\nJimin\u2019s head jerks in a nod and he heads to the bedroom.\nJaebum doesn\u2019t come yet, which he\u2019s thankful for. He just\u2014needs a breather. Now that he\u2019s away from that stupid alpha smell his head\u2019s a little less cloudy, his judgment a little better. His body seems to be sobering up too, judging from the way his stomach knots up, the regret setting in.\nIs he really going to do this? He knows it\u2019ll make the music shows awkward from now on\u2014he won\u2019t be able to look at Jaebum in the same way. God, this might fuck up things between them and GOT7 forever.\nAnd Jungkook.\nShit.  Jungkook. \nHe can\u2019t stop thinking about him. Even though there\u2019s another Alpha here, Jimin wants Jungkook. He wants Jungkook\u2019s scent all over him, his body pinning him down, his knot inside of him. Jaebum wouldn\u2019t be the same, not even close. God, what is he doing?\nJaebum raps on the door even though it\u2019s already open.\n\u201cHey.\u201d\nThe door closes behind him, clicking shut as he enters, and Jimin\u2019s chest starts pounding. The panic hits him. Jimin feels trapped, like a rabbit cornered in its den, and his knees lock up, pulse racing when he sees the way Jaebum stares at him. Maybe this whole thing wasn\u2019t such a good idea.\n\n Jimin, what the hell did you get yourself into? \n\nJaebum strides through the room, covers the distance between the door and Jimin in no time at all, and Jimin\u2019s legs go weak, limbs shaking like he\u2019s a newborn foal still learning how to walk.\n\u201cJaebum-hyung,\u201d he says frantically.\nJimin stumbles back onto Taehyung\u2019s bed, his own bunk too far away.\nJaebum\u2019s eyes are dark, searing hot, hard and determined as he presses closer, pushing Jimin until his back is flush against the mattress. Jaebum crowds Jimin with his body, cages Jimin in with his arms, and Jimin\u2019s breath stutters.\n\u201cHyung\u2014\u201d Jimin stammers, heart pounding in his ears. Jaebum\u2019s face is predatory like he\u2019s readying himself for a meal, gaze raking down slow, inching down Jimin\u2019s body like he\u2019s trying to figure out what part he wants to eat first.\n\u201cYou smell  so fucking good,\u201d Jaebum groans.\nHis head dips down to the crook of Jimin\u2019s neck, nose grazing against his vein and Jimin\u2019s stomach tenses. The feel of it makes something inside him quiver, body heating up, legs parting despite himself. When Jaebum grazes his teeth against Jimin\u2019s neck, Jimin\u2019s chest hiccups, stuttering as he tries to breathe. The omega in him wants it, just any alpha knot, but there\u2019s a voice in his head that\u2019s telling him it\u2019s not as good\u2014not the same. Jaebum\u2019s smell is nice but too different: acidic while Jungkook\u2019s was sweet, cool while Jungkook\u2019s was warm. It\u2019s not the same jittery high that Jungkook gives him. Fucking Jaebum would be like having a snack in place of a meal and Jimin\u2019s greedy. He wants the whole goddamn buffet.\n\u201cJaebum-hyung,\u201d he stutters, too meek of a warning.\nJaebum keeps going, nipping at Jimin\u2019s neck with his sharp teeth, lapping at his skin. He moans, low and throaty, still mouthing at Jimin\u2019s neck like he\u2019s famished\u2014and Jimin breathes in that icy scent of a forest rain and knows that he doesn\u2019t want this anymore, wants someone else.\n\u201cJaebum-hyung, wait\u2014\u201d The bites don\u2019t stop and Jimin starts panicking. He brings his arms up, shoving at Jaebum\u2019s chest, \u201c\u2014hyung!\u201d\nJaebum pulls away, lips pursed in annoyance.\n\u201cWhat is it,\u201d he grits.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t think is a good idea.\u201d\nJimin winces at the way Jaebum\u2019s face seems to twist. He tacks on another \u201csorry\u201d for good measure, hopes that it\u2019ll be enough.\n\u201cYou called me all the way over here\u2026 just to tell me you\u2019ve changed your mind?\u201d\nJimin\u2019s face grows hot and he turns away, averts his gaze from Jaebum\u2019s accusing scowl. But even if he doesn\u2019t see it, he still feels Jaebum\u2019s hard store boring into him, piercing through his skin. The guilt makes his stomach burn.\n\u201cSorry. I think my heat just\u2014made me a little desperate.\u201d\nJaebum is quiet, just sits back on his heels and studies him, eyes probing, like he\u2019s trying to analyze every single microexpression that flits across Jimin\u2019s face. Jaebum\u2019s not stupid, Jimin knows he can read between the lines, that he hears the \u201cI want you to leave\u201d that Jimin can\u2019t seem to say out loud. But Jaebum doesn\u2019t move.\n\u201cI can smell you dripping,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you\u2019re telling me you don\u2019t want this?\u201d\nJimin flushes in shame, eyes still fixed on the wall. He knows he dug himself into this mess so he bites his tongue, takes the berating because it\u2019s the least of what he deserves right now.\nGod, he was so stupid. So desperate and stupid.\nThe silence stretches between them, heavy and tense, and Jaebum shifts on the bed. He thinks Jaebum finally gets the hint, that he\u2019ll leave and they can just pretend the whole thing never happened. But then there\u2019s a pair of hands on his thighs, large, strong hands that burn hot through his sweatpants. They just rest there, right above his knees, flaring against his skin even through the thick cotton, and Jimin\u2019s stomach flips.\n\u201cPark Jimin,\u201d Jaebum says, voice low, so deep that Jimin feels it resonating in his chest, like the rumbling bass at a concert.\nJaebum doesn\u2019t say anything else but his hands move, slithering up Jimin\u2019s thighs, and Jimin draws back, his breath hitching, legs twitching as the hands creep up.\n\u201cHyung,\u201d he gasps. \u201cHyung, I mean it.\u201d\nThe fingers inch their way up to Jimin\u2019s stomach and Jimin\u2019s pulse spikes. His hands dart down, grips Jaebum\u2019s wrists like handcuffs and holds onto them tight, keeping them from trailing up any further.\n\u201cJaebum-hyung,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cPlease. Leave.\u201d\nJaebum doesn\u2019t even get a chance to answer before the door bursts open without warning. The slam makes Jimin spring up, startled, and his mind races, heart thudding furiously.  Who the hell could be home at this time? \nJimin peers over Jaebum\u2019s shoulder and recognizes the looming figure with a start.\nJungkook\u2019s standing in the doorway, his eyes wild, knuckles clenched bone-white around the doorknob. Jimin can smell Jungkook\u2019s scent even from the bed, fuck\u2014it\u2019s making his body tingle, slick leaking out of him. He knows Jaebum smells the change because his nostrils flare, fingers twitching uselessly in Jimin\u2019s grasp.\n\u201cHyung,\u201d Jungkook says from the doorway. His voice is smaller than Jimin expects and he realizes with stunning clarity how bad this must look: him all alone in the dorm, Jaebum halfway on top of him.\nJimin lets go of Jaebum\u2019s wrists, his cheeks burning.\n\u201cHyung,\u201d Jungkook says again. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here?\u201d\n\u201cHe  was invited,\u201d Jaebum drawls, as though Jimin didn\u2019t tell him to leave just a few minutes ago.\nJungkook doesn\u2019t budge from the doorway. His lips are pressed thinly together and he looks past Jaebum, his eyes fixed accusingly on Jimin instead. That look makes Jimin want to curl up, but he can\u2019t get himself to look away. He swallows, guilt lodged in his throat, face still hot from the shame.\n\u201cJiminie-hyung,\u201d Jungkook says, barely above a whisper. \u201cYou know we\u2019re not allowed to bring anyone back to the dorms.\u201d\n\u201cI  know, dammit, I just\u2014\u201d He breaks off with a snarl, frustrated with himself. The disbelief on Jungkook\u2019s face makes him feel pathetic. He didn\u2019t want Jungkook to see him like this\u2014desperate and heat-ridden and stupid for alpha cock, just like the omegas that everyone talks about. This heat makes everything a mess.\n\u201cJaebum-hyung. I\u2019m sorry. Can you\u2026 please leave?\u201d he asks, his voice strangled and weak, more unsure than he wanted it to sound.\nJimin knows he hit a nerve, calling Jaebum out with another Alpha in the room. He\u2019s fucked up. He could see it in the way Jaebum\u2019s jaw juts out, his lips curling derisively. There\u2019s a visible tension in Jaebum\u2019s muscles. His shoulders roll, languid, reminding Jimin of a jaguar with its head low and its teeth bared like it\u2019s ready to pounce. Jimin holds his breath, stills his body and does his best not to provoke him further.\n\u201cHe asked you to leave.\u201d\nMotherfucking Jungkook.\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Jaebum jeers. \u201cAre you gonna take care of your hyung instead?\u201d\n\n \u201cJaebum-hyung.\u201d \n\n\u201cAs if  you  could,\u201d Jungkook bites.\n\u201cI could do it better than you, little baby Alpha.\u201d\nJungkook bares his teeth.\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d\n\u201cOh, did I hit a nerve?\u201d Jaebum taunts.\n\u201cJiminie-hyung\u2019s not thinking straight and you\u2019re taking advantage of him, so leave.\u201d\n Taking advantage of, what the fuck? Jungkook thinks he\u2019s this helpless?\n\u201cReally? Because he was moaning out to me over the phone,\u201d Jaebum retorts, his chin high.\nJimin shrieks,  \u201cJaebum-hyung!\u201d  His face is boiling, humiliated. He can\u2019t believe Jaebum just said something like that\u2014he looks so bad in front of Jungkook, so damn pathetic, desperate and needy from the hormones. Fuck, he just wants to die. He\u2019s so mortified.\nJungkook doesn\u2019t take it too well. He sucks in his cheeks, jabs his tongue against the side of his mouth like he\u2019s biting on it with his molars. Jimin could see the tremble of rage in Jungkook\u2019s arms, the way his fists clench and unclench, shoulders stiffening, so close to throwing a punch.\n\u201cHe just told you to leave,\u201d Jungkook stresses, words harsh and sibilant. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want you.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean he wants you, baby Alpha.\u201d  And Jimin\u2019s fucking tired of this. Their playground fight is giving him a headache and he\u2019s not about to be fought over like some piece of meat. He\u2019s done being some goddamn trophy, done with all of these Alphas and their stupid sense of pride.  \u201cGet out.\u201d\nTheir heads whip toward him, squabble interrupted.\n\u201cBoth of you,\u201d Jimin snaps. \u201cGet the hell out of my room.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re in heat,\u201d Jaebum says, dumbfounded \u201cYou can\u2019t go through one without an Alpha.\u201d\n\u201cI can. And I will!\u201d he barks. His face is tightening like a clay mask, the flush of anger itching under his skin.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to drag this out any longer so please. Leave.\u201d\nJaebum gawks at him, doesn't believe what Jimin\u2019s saying. When he starts gnawing on the inside of his cheek, Jimin readies himself for another argument. Jimin\u2019s temper is short and he knows Jaebum\u2019s isn\u2019t much better. But Jaebum is more receptive than Jimin expects him to be\u2014maybe it\u2019s because Jimin told both of them to leave, called the battle a draw. Alphas were always so petty.\nWith a growl, Jaebum tears himself off of the bed, brushes his shirt down like he\u2019s trying to salvage that last bit of pride.\n\u201cMake up your mind next time.\u201d  He bulldozes through Jungkook on the way out, knocking into him with his shoulder, and Jimin holds his breath, prays to god Jungkook can hold back his temper. He doesn\u2019t want to sit through another one of these Alpha competitions.\nBut Jaebum leaves with no other complications. When the front door slams, Jimin flops back onto the bed with a heavy sigh.\nHe fucked up.\nIt\u2019s going to be awkward from now on, no doubt about it. Even if he didn\u2019t fuck Jaebum, it\u2019s never going to be the same. He can just imagine the lecture that\u2019ll be waiting for him when Namjoon finds out, when word eventually gets out to Jackson. He\u2019s just hoping the whole thing won\u2019t blow up and involve the company too. He doesn\u2019t need this to turn into some big scandal, doesn\u2019t want to make the omega name worse than it already is.  Jimin pulls at his shirt, itchy from where it\u2019s damp and clinging to his skin. He\u2019s still feeling restless from the heat and Jungkook\u2019s presence is driving him nuts. He can still smell him from the doorway. He needs Jungkook to leave. His temper\u2019s getting shorter by the minute, his sanity dangling by a thread.\n\u201cJungkook, I told you to get out,\u201d he says tersely, clenching his eyes shut, breathing as shallowly as he can, tries not to inhale that rich, dark cacao.\nJungkook stays rooted to the ground, body blocking the doorway. Even without looking he can tell Jungkook didn\u2019t leave yet\u2014his smell still lingers heavy in the air, like a candle that\u2019s been left burning, forgotten.\nJimin peeks up and sees the lost expression on Jungkook\u2019s face. His eyes are wide and bulging like a deer in headlights and his hands are fisted, gripping the fabric of his jeans so tight his veins pop out.\n\u201cJungkook,\u201d Jimin says, exasperated. The heat\u2019s building again in his stomach, his body seems to twitch like it\u2019s begging for it.\n\u201cHyung, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2014\u201d\nHe finally shifts, walks over step by step, his feet dragging like his legs are somehow moving of their own volition. His face is still blank. Stunned.\n\u201cHyung,\u201d he says again, voice wrecked and torn out of his throat.\nThe cacao gets stronger with each step that he takes and Jimin\u2019s breath gets heavier, his legs draw up of their own accord, closer to his body, curling in. His palms are sweating, fingers numb and buried in the sheets. He can\u2019t\u2014he can\u2019t do this. Can\u2019t do this to Jungkook.\n\u201cJungkook,\u201d he chokes. \u201cJungkook, if you come any closer I\u2019m gonna punch you.\u201d\nJungkook stops in his tracks but his face contorts, distraught.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, nearly a sob. \u201cI just\u2014you just\u2014you smell like him and I can\u2019t take it. I need to fix it.\u201d\n\u201cFix it?\u201d Jimin asks in a daze, blood rushing in his ears.\n\n\"Please.\u201d \n\nHe doesn\u2019t know what \u201cfixing\u201d means exactly, but Jungkook looks so pained and desperate that Jimin gives in with a barely a nod of his head.  Jungkook collapses on him with a sigh of relief, squeezes all of the air out of Jimin\u2019s lungs with his weight. He cloaks Jimin\u2019s body with his own, presses up against him from head to toe, heavy and hot and smelling so good that Jimin whimpers.\nIt\u2019s like the kitchen incident again. Jungkook\u2019s nose brushes against his neck, slow and deliberate, painting in short strokes, lines that lead all the way down to his collarbones. The warm puffs of air as Jungkook breathes against him makes him shiver, and his pulse stutters at the way Jungkook\u2019s nose traces lower, tickling him with its light touch. Jungkook\u2019s scent is like a cloud around him, a fog of warmth and sweetness that surrounds him and makes his cock hard, makes the slick drip out of him again, like his body suddenly remembers just how badly it needs a knot.\n\u201cHyung,\u201d Jungkook says, voice tight. \u201cJiminie-hyung, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t\u2014you just smell so\u2014\u201d\nJungkook\u2019s teeth are at his neck now, biting at his skin like he\u2019s trying to erase any traces that Jaebum may have left behind. It\u2019s hot and wet and Jimin trembles, feels the stinging jolt of the bites all the way down to his fingertips.\nHe was right. It\u2019s so different with Jungkook\u2014it\u2019s a jittery high that makes his head teeter close to insanity, makes his body itch for more.  Jimin\u2019s breaths start coming faster, harder, like his lungs are trying to inhale as much of Jungkook\u2019s scent as possible. He doesn\u2019t even know how far he\u2019s gone until he feels the sharp nip of nails digging into his palms from where he\u2019s fisting the sheets.\n\u201cJungkook,\u201d  he gasps.\nJungkook groans, still licking at Jimin\u2019s neck, and Jimin hisses at a particularly hard bite at his jawline. It\u2019s like Jungkook\u2019s trying to eat him, tear him to pieces with every peck like some bird of prey.\nJimin loves it.\u00a0The fever\u2019s coursing through his veins like rapids. He\u2019s so fucking wet and desperate and he can't help but want more.\n\u201cJungkook,\u201d he shudders, lets out a shaky moan when Jungkook\u2019s tongue trails up to his ear, \u201c\u2014Jungkook, I need\u2014\u201d I need you to fuck me.   Jungkook must have guessed what he\u2019s trying to say from the way his head reels back, mouth gaping like a fish out of water, snapped out of his spell. Jungkook\u2019s face pales, eyes running up and down Jimin\u2019s body frantically as though Jimin\u2019s a mistake, as though he\u2019s a crime Jungkook just committed and the realization finally hit him cold.\n\u201cJiminie-hyung,\u201d he stammers, distressed.\nHis hands retract so quickly it\u2019s like Jimin burned him. And fuck, Jimin should have known. It\u2019s just his omega pheromones turning him into Alpha bait again.\n\u201cHyung, I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Jungkook babbles. \u201cI just\u2014I can\u2019t.\u201d\nHe shrinks back, pulls himself off and flees before Jimin can stop him, disappearing to his room faster than Jimin can blink.  And Jimin is left on the bed, dizzy and hurt, slick still leaking out of him. His gut twists, acid rising up his throat.\nHe can\u2019t believe Jungkook just got up and left. Ran away because Jimin couldn\u2019t keep his hormones in check, because he got too fucking desperate, just like every other pathetic omega.\nFuck, he\u2019s already messed things up with Jaebum. Jimin knows this is going to be it for them too\u2014that Jungkook\u2019s just going to ignore him again, forget that anything ever happened.  And it might be the heat that cuts his temper even shorter but Jimin\u2019s had it. He\u2019s so tired of the way these hormones are tugging him around on a leash, tired of these Alphas that can\u2019t control themselves around him, tired of Jungkook walking on eggshells around him.\nThe rage barrels through him like a storm.\nHis vision clouds, irritation licking at him, itching at the pads of his fingers. He flings himself off of the bed and stomps over, doesn\u2019t even bother to knock on the door, just slams it open, fuck courtesy.\nJungkook freezes from where he\u2019s pacing, hair frazzled and mouth agape, wide eyes staring at Jimin in disbelief. That dumb look on his face makes Jimin snap.\n\u201cAre you fucking serious?\u201d Jimin snarls.\n \u201dHyung,\u201d  Jungkook croaks.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m just some pathetic little omega,\u201d Jimin says, seething.\n\u201cI\u2014wait, what?\u201d He frowns, face twisting in confusion. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou just\u2014you just  mauled  my neck and then left. What the fuck, Jungkook?\u201d\n\u201cHyung,\u201d Jungkook stammers in distress, his face paling, shoulders hunching inward. \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014I\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have any goddamn control over my pheromones but you can\u2019t just\u2014sniff me and freak out\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014Jiminie-hyung, I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014NO. Shut up and listen. I\u2019m tired of everyone treating me differently just because I\u2019m an omega. I\u2019m not some fucking prize to be won or some new toy to try out. I\u2019m your fucking hyung\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI  know  that,\u201d Jungkook shouts. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re treating me like I\u2019m beneath you! You don\u2019t even\u2014\u201d The words come out faster, like smoke spewing from a volcano. \u201c\u2014either you treat me like I don\u2019t exist or you just hover around me like I\u2019m pathetic and can\u2019t take care of myself or something\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I was\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd Jaebum-hyung!\u201d Jungkook stiffens, cheek protruding from where Jungkook\u2019s tongue pokes against it, so lousy at hiding his annoyance. Jungkook\u2019s silent competition with Jaebum somehow incenses Jimin even more, makes Jimin foam at the mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re always such an asshole to him\u2014and to all of these other Alphas that come within smelling distance of me. I\u2019m not some\u2014some princess  that needs your protection. I\u2019m a grown ass man\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI  know\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThen stop it!\u201d Jimin shrieks, his temper spiraling out of control. \u201cGod, as if it\u2019s not gonna be awkward enough. You just had to be a dick to him\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you even invite him?!\u201d Jungkook fumes, his neck muscles tensing, vein popping as he clenches his jaw.\nJimin glares at him.\n\u201cI was in heat,\u201d he seethes, baring his teeth. \u201cAnd what does it fucking matter?\u201d\nJungkook scowls and crosses his arms like a petulant child.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call\u2014\u201d\nHe spits, \u201cCall who?!\u201d Because god forbid if Jungkook thinks he should have called Yoongi or Namjoon for help.\nBut Jungkook has the sense to keep his mouth shut.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Jimin says, his voice coming out more abrasive than he expected. \u201cI\u2019m just sick of you treating me like a child\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re  the one treating  me  like a child! I didn\u2019t even\u2014I wasn\u2019t even trying to, I just\u2014I can\u2019t fucking help it and\u2014goddammit hyung,  stop coming closer.\u201d\nJimin freezes, grinds to a halt right at the foot of Jungkook\u2019s bed. The panic rushes in like a cold chill when he realizes how close he\u2019s gotten, how far he\u2019s moved without even knowing. Even when he\u2019s pissed off the omega in him still drags itself over to Jungkook like a magnet. Fuck, he\u2019s never felt so out of control.\n\u201cFuck\u2014fucking\u2014\u201d Jimin breaks off into a sob, just collapses to the floor, boneless, fight draining out of him like water through an open hand. \u201cThis is such bullshit.\u201d\nJungkook doesn\u2019t say anything, doesn\u2019t even look at him. He just sits down at the far end of his bed, his entire body so tense Jimin can see the strain in his muscles. Jungkook\u2019s hand is rubbing at his scalp in anguish, digging through his thick hair like he\u2019s trying to massage away a headache.\nJimin\u2019s so sick of what the hormones have reduced them to, just two horses on a carousel, constantly running in circles around each other.\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of this,\u201d he says.\nJungkook grunts in return.\nAnd Jimin doesn\u2019t know why he says it\u2014maybe it\u2019s the irritation from the heat, or maybe the way all of his frustrations have been building up like a tower of blocks, layer upon layer until it sways, seconds away from toppling over.\nHe blurts, \u201cWhy\u2019d you have to be a goddamn Alpha out of all people?\u201d\nJungkook\u2019s head jerks up and he sends Jimin a nasty glower.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for it,\u201d he snarls.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2014\u201d Jimin stops himself and breathes in slow, clenches his fists in his sweats to keep himself from snapping again. He knows he\u2019d be fighting a losing battle. He doesn\u2019t even remember what this whole argument is about anymore.\n\u201cForget it,\u201d he says with finality. \u201cThis is ridiculous. I\u2019m going.\u201d  He pushes himself up and makes a move for the door but there\u2019s a sudden grip on his arm that tugs him back, firm and tight, keeping him from leaving.\nJimin twists his head back to see the way Jungkook\u2019s face is slack, mouth gaping in shock.\n\u201cShit, I\u2014\u201d\nThe hand recoils, flinching back, and Jungkook makes a noise of despair.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know why I\u2014\u201d He stops and squeezes his eyes shut, clamps his lips tight as though he\u2019s trying to hold back a scream. \u201cHyung, you should go,\u201d he rasps.\nThe anger rushes back with a vengeance, temper building up higher than the pressure inside a whistling kettle. \u201cWhat, so you can pretend like nothing happened again?\u201d\n\u201cJiminie-hyung,\u201d he stresses, hissing through the front of his teeth.\n\u201cThis is what I\u2019m talking about\u2014you just sniff me and then pretend like I don\u2019t exist. I get that you Alphas can\u2019t control yourselves but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Jungkook barks, his own patience wearing thin. \u201cI\u2019m just a poor little baby Alpha with no restraint.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said.\u201d\n\u201cIt basically was,\u201d Jungkook scoffs.\n\u201cYou\u2019re being such a goddamn child!\u201d Jimin shouts, fed up. \u201cWhen did you get so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2014so what, hyung?\u201d he goads.\n\u201cUnruly! Like some\u2014some\u2014\u201d Jimin growls, hates how ineloquent he is, how he can never find the right words to say.\n\u201cSome monster?\u201d Jungkook spits.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin squints.\nSince when did this entire thing get so out of control? He feels it slipping between his fingers, bolting out of his grasp like a runaway train.\nJungkook stares at him unflinchingly, his jaw set, eyes cold and defiant.\n\u201cI\u2019m a monster, right? Just some animal? Some beast that can\u2019t control himself?\u201d\nAnd Jimin hates the words that Jungkook\u2019s putting in his mouth. His fingers are flexing in irritation, itching to punch that condescending glare off of Jungkook\u2019s face.\n\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cHyung,\u201d Jungkook says sharply, clutching the edge of his mattress like it\u2019s the only thing keeping his self-restraint in check. \u201cLeave.\u201d\nJimin\u2019s reached his breaking point, sick of Jungkook treating him like a child, shooing Jimin away when he\u2019s done with him.\nHe growls and storms over, furious, grips Jungkook\u2019s shirt before he can hold himself back. \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking tell me what to do,\u201d he hisses in his face.\u00a0\nJungkook\u2019s eyes flash as though he\u2019s been challenged.\nHe utters, low and dangerous, \u201cJimin-ah. If you don\u2019t leave, I\u2019m really not gonna control myself.\u201d\u00a0\nFor some reason, Jimin can\u2019t get himself to move. His hands are still fisted in Jungkook\u2019s shirt, his feet glued to the floor. His heart is pounding like a bass drum and he stands stock-still, petrified, like some caught prey.  And then he\u2019s being tugged down into Jungkook\u2019s bed, his back pushed into the mattress. Jungkook\u2019s scent is soaked deep into the sheets, the smell so thick that Jimin swears it\u2019s woven into every thread. The cloud of cacao envelops him, cloaks him like a down blanket in the middle of summer, and his irritation melts right off. A low whine bubbles up inside of him, lodged in his throat.\nHe hates the way his body gives in so easily when he was so pissed just seconds before. But Jungkook has always done that, bends Jimin just like a reed when Jimin\u2019s redwood to everyone else. Thaws him like ice.\nThere\u2019s a long, shuddering breath coming from above. Jungkook hovers on top of him, not touching him in the slightest yet still managing to twist and churn the heat simmering in Jimin\u2019s gut. In the corner of his eyes he can see the way Jungkook clenches at the sheets, his veins bulging, raised under his skin.\nWhen Jimin glances up, Jungkook\u2019s eyes are scrunched tight like he\u2019s in pain.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to go like this,\u201d Jungkook says, voice strained, thick-sounding like he\u2019s trying to hold back his tears. \u201cNot\u2014not when you\u2019re in heat.\u201d\nBut even as he says that, he presses his hand hot against Jimin\u2019s chest, dragging lower and lower, searing Jimin even through his shirt. Jimin\u2019s in a daze, can\u2019t find it in him to respond.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, hyung. Really am a monster,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cThe shittiest Alpha in the world.\u201d\nThe hand is splayed flat against Jimin\u2019s hips now, slowly creeping up beneath the hem of his shirt. His stomach quivers when he finally feels the burning press of Jungkook\u2019s fingers against his bare skin. Jimin\u2019s head is foggy, high from the heat and from Jungkook\u2019s smell\u2014but somewhere through the blurry haze, he hears the apologies tumbling out of Jungkook\u2019s mouth, pleading and desperate: \u201c\u2014sorry\u2014I\u2019m so sorry. You should\u2019ve\u2014you should\u2019ve called Yoongi-hyung or Namjoon-hyung. I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t get why Jungkook\u2019s apologizing so much\u2014even through the fog he knows Jungkook\u2019s being stupid, can\u2019t believe Jungkook would even consider those two. Dully, Jimin mumbles to him, \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d though he can never help the fondness laced in his words.\n\u201cFuck, you\u2019re just so\u2014\u201d Jungkook breaks off, voice on the edge of a sob, and he dips his head to the crook of Jimin\u2019s neck. He nibbles at the skin exposed by Jimin\u2019s low shirt, mouths at it hungrily, and Jimin does a full-body shiver, feet flexing against the sheets. Jungkook\u2019s breath is warm, caressing his skin as he speaks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, hyung\u2014I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019ve tried so fucking hard to control myself but I\u2019m just so\u2014\u201d Sentences unfinished again.\nJimin frowns.\n\u201cWhat are you\u2026?\u201d\nA particularly hard bite to his collarbones makes him gasp, question forgotten. The hand is moving up his chest, slow and torturous, sliding up his body before it settles on gripping his side tight. A thumb rubs against his nipple, massages it in rough circles, and Jimin can feel himself getting hard again. Fuck, he\u2019s dripping right into the sheets.\n\u201cHyung,\u201d Jungkook says it like he\u2019s praying. \u201cHyung, you\u2019re driving me crazy. You smell so good I just wanna\u2014devour  you.\u201d And Jimin wants it too, wants Jungkook to drain him completely. Eat him up until there\u2019s nothing left. \u201c\u2014I wanna mark you up. Want all the other Alphas to smell me on you.\u201d  His shirt is hitched all the way up, scrunched underneath his armpits. Jimin\u2019s torso is exposed to the cold air but he\u2019s feeling overheated, his body shivering at the way Jungkook nips at his chest, a thumb still pressing firmly on his nipple. When Jungkook sucks at the other one, tongue flicking over the bud, Jimin can\u2019t help but whine, shoots a hand up to grasp at Jungkook\u2019s hair. He knows he\u2019s pulling hard but Jungkook doesn\u2019t stop. He just moans when Jimin squeezes the strands between his fingers, tilts his hips towards Jimin and grinds his cock against Jimin\u2019s leg.\nJimin gasps, oversensitive and dizzy. The hands feel so good, so large and hot against him, and Jungkook\u2019s cock rubbing against him is making his own twitch in need. Jungkook grabs and pulls at him, slides his hands all over Jimin\u2019s body, and Jimin moans, blood buzzing in his ears, arching towards Jungkook. He\u2019s so needy it\u2019s embarrassing but he wants more. Wants to feel full.\n\u201cJungkook,\u201d he calls noisily, voice pitched in desperation. \u201cJungkook, fuck me.\u201d\nJungkook\u2019s hands grip him on reflex, a clamp around his ribs. \u201cJiminie-hyung,\u201d Jungkook groans. \u201cYou\u2019re heat-drunk, you don\u2019t\u2014you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a thing, stupid,\u201d Jimin murmurs, body lurching when Jungkook pinches at his nipple a little too hard, when he bites deeper than necessary.\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Jungkook moans against his chest, low and ragged. \u201cHyung, you\u2019re in heat. You\u2019re\u2014\u201d\nJimin grips Jungkook\u2019s hair tight, pulls his head back until he\u2019s looking Jimin in the eye, and Jungkook looks just as gone as Jimin probably does right now, his pupils dilated, face a little pink.\n\u201cI want it,\u201d Jimin pleads. \u201cJungkook, I want you to fuck me.\u201d\nAnd he knows he might regret it later, that Jungkook might avoid him again despite the stupid argument they just had, that it might fuck up things between them forever\u2014but his chest is squeezing so tight that he can\u2019t breathe and right now, his rationality is gone. He\u2019s so strung out, just wants to be as close to Jungkook as possible, wants Jungkook\u2019s scent to bleed into his skin, wants Jungkook so deep inside of him that he would end up aching for weeks.\nJimin doesn\u2019t expect Jungkook\u2019s face to crumple up like he\u2019s about to cry.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I like you\u2014I really  like you, hyung. I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d\nJungkook kisses him like he\u2019s starving, teeth clicking when he swoops in too quickly. He dips his tongue in and tastes Jimin wherever he can, and Jimin\u2019s body tingles at the way Jungkook kisses, impatient just like him, wet and hot and frantic, as though he\u2019s scared Jimin will change his mind.\n\u201c\u2014I like you, hyung,\u201d he breathes, words lost through the kisses. \u201cI like you.\u201d\nHe says it over and over, and Jimin\u2019s pulse flutters when it finally sinks in, his lungs constricting at the strain in Jungkook\u2019s voice, the desperation. But he brushes it off with a grimace and reminds himself not to get his hopes up. It\u2019s just a side effect of the hormones, he should know better\u2014\nBut he doesn\u2019t want to think about that right now. Not when Jungkook\u2019s tongue is sliding against his own, wet and hot.\n\u201cJungkook,\u201d he gasps. \u201dHurry.\u201d \nJungkook lets out a weak groan, fingers digging into Jimin\u2019s shoulders like he\u2019s trying to restrain himself, but he still kisses Jimin, nips at his neck like he\u2019s starving.\n\u201cHyung, I\u2014I\u2019m so sorry it has to be like this.\u201d\n \u201dShut up,\u201d  Jimin says, throat closing up at the agony in Jungkook\u2019s voice, tight and pained like he\u2019s been punched in the gut. It\u2019s all his fault.\n\u201cI\u2019m the one who should be apologizing, stupid.\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice cracks. \u201cIt\u2019s these goddamn pheromones. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nThe kisses stop and Jungkook rears back with his brows furrowed.\nAnd there\u2019s a sting at the back of his eyes, a sharp pulling sensation that burns when he sees Jungkook\u2019s face in front of him. God, he can\u2019t believe it ended up like this, when Jungkook doesn\u2019t even want it.\nJimin tips his head back towards the ceiling, blinks hard to keep the tears from coming but it\u2019s no use. It\u2019s like all the tension culminated in this, building high until the tower finally falls, until Jimin breaks down, shoulders racking as he cries.\n\u201cHyung!\u201d Jungkook hisses frantically, cupping Jimin\u2019s cheeks with his hands. \u201cHyung\u2014hyung, please.  Please  don\u2019t cry.\u201d\nThe concern in Jungkook\u2019s voice makes Jimin sob even more. It reminds him of when they first debuted, when he kept on messing up, not as  perfect  as he needed to be, and Jungkook caught him crying in the middle of the night, saw him berating himself for not being better, broken under the pressure. Jungkook has always sucked at feelings so he didn\u2019t say anything. Just crawled into Jimin\u2019s bed and slept right next to him.\nBut everything\u2019s so different now and it hurts. They\u2019ll never have that same comfortability again. Jungkook hardly even comes near him now, not unless the pheromones make him, when it drags him like a prisoner to his cell.\nThese hormones just turned everything to shit.\nJimin brings his palms up to his face, presses them hard against his eyelids in order to stop the tears, but they keep bursting through.\n\u201cHyung,  please. I\u2019m sorry\u2014I\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t want you to cry.\u201d\n\u201cStop apologizing!\u201d he yells.\nHis lungs are faltering like someone popped them, he can\u2019t get any air in, just keeps gasping and gasping. He hates this, wants it to stop, wants everything to go back to the way it was. But he knows it\u2019ll never be the same, not when he\u2019s an omega, when he\u2019s\u2014practically in love  with Jungkook.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this.\u201d\n\u201cJiminie-hyung?\u201d Jungkook whispers.\n\u201cI just\u2014I  hate being an omega. Look at what these stupid pheromones did to you,\u201d he wheezes, voice pitching in a whine. \u201cI hate it.\u201d\nJungkook grips Jimin\u2019s wrists, pulls Jimin\u2019s hands away from his face.\n\u201cHyung, what are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cMy omega pheromones are making you crazy!\u201d he says, hysterical. Jimin forces himself to breathe but his lungs still feel like they\u2019re collapsing in on themselves. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. I didn\u2019t wanna force you into this.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! If anything,  I\u2019m  the one forcing  you  into this! Jiminie-hyung, you\u2019re\u2014\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice gets smaller, sounding more broken. \u201cYou\u2019re heat-drunk and I\u2019m just\u2014I can\u2019t even control myself around you.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t expect Jungkook to break down too. He\u2019s always managed to stay strong, never cries if he can help it\u2014always tells them, \u201chyung, I\u2019m fine,\u201d an Alpha through and through. But now, Jungkook sounds so distraught that Jimin\u2019s chest feels heavy, heart aching at Jungkook\u2019s stifled sobs.\n\u201cHyung, I\u2019m sorry\u2014I tried  so hard. I didn\u2019t\u2014I didn\u2019t want it to be during your heat. Didn\u2019t wanna take advantage of you. Hyung, I  really  like you.\u201d\nJungkook\u2019s head drops onto Jimin\u2019s chest, shoulders slumping, cheeks wet with tears. But Jimin\u2019s dazed, stuck on Jungkook\u2019s words.\nHe doesn\u2019t want it during Jimin\u2019s  heat.\n\u201cJiminie-hyung, I like you so much,\u201d he cries. \u201cI know I\u2019m just some fucking kid\u2014I\u2019m the worst Alpha in the world, but\u2014Jiminie-hyung, I like you so fucking much.\u201d\nAnd the mask finally cracks. He can\u2019t hide it any longer.\n\u201cI like you too, stupid,\u201d he spills, voice shaky from relief. He combs through Jungkook\u2019s hair with a hand, clutches Jungkook to his chest, makes sure he\u2019s not dreaming. He\u2019s so damn happy.\nAnd Jungkook laughs. A laugh that\u2019s pitched high in disbelief, one that makes his shoulders quake, sending vibrations through Jimin like a bow gliding over a cello string. Jungkook hugs him with all of his strength, arms squeezing around Jimin\u2019s ribs, and the tension rolls through him. Jimin feels boneless, like he\u2019s about to sink through the mattress.\n\u201cGod, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d Jungkook\u2019s smiling and breathless, eyes watery from the tears, shining so bright that Jimin\u2019s heart jumps to his throat. His chest is so full it\u2019s a breath away from bursting.  He pulls Jungkook down, kisses Jungkook without hesitation, hard and bruising, desperate to make up for all the missed opportunities. He tastes salt when he sucks at Jungkook\u2019s lips but it slowly melts into something sweeter. It\u2019s so much better, so much more  real.\nJungkook moans into his mouth, licks against his tongue, and Jimin shifts on the bed, the embers in his gut still burning low, so close to catching fire again. He can\u2019t help but squirm at the wet slide of Jungkook\u2019s tongue against his own. The kiss is still just as desperate before but it\u2019s slower now. Deeper. Like Jungkook\u2019s trying to savor every bit of him, make the meal last as long as possible.\n\u201cDo you know how good you smell, hyung?\u201d Jungkook growls, pulling at Jimin\u2019s bottom lip with his teeth. \u201cIt drives me insane.\u201d\nOf course he knows. He could see it in the glossy, hypnotized eyes of the Alphas all around him, in the way they lean in when he passes. But nothing could ever compare to hearing  Jungkook say it out loud. It makes something inside of him purr, makes him curl up in satisfaction from being praised.  He tugs at Jungkook\u2019s shirt and Jungkook gets the message, breaks the kiss to strip Jimin of his tee before he pulls his own off right behind it.\nJungkook\u2019s skin is damp, cooler to the touch than Jimin expected, but maybe it\u2019s because  he\u2019s  the one burning up, body on edge from the emotions, from the hormones. His heat\u2019s been wavering all day, rising and falling like a rollercoaster, but he can tell from the way his fingers tingle that it\u2019s building up again, so close to reaching the peak.\nMaybe Jungkook smells the change in him too because he bites his way down again with a fervor, desperation rekindled. He\u2019s grabbing at Jimin everywhere, sucking at every inch of skin like he\u2019s trying to paint Jimin with bruises. He takes his time at the \u2018v\u2019 of Jimin\u2019s hips, enamored by the way Jimin twitches with every nip there. And then he moves lower, mouths right at Jimin\u2019s cock through his sweatpants, and Jimin jolts.\nJungkook groans, ragged and deep in his throat as his tongue laps wide over the cotton, licking like he can\u2019t get enough, and Jimin whimpers at the feel of his tongue, his breath, so warm even through the fabric. The heat\u2019s licking at his stomach, surging through him like a torrent branching into streams, flames blazing down lines of petrol. His hands flounder, scrabbling for the pillow resting beside him.\n \u201cJungkook,\u201d  he whines, breath hitching.\nJimin can\u2019t do anything but watch, glassy-eyed, as Jungkook pulls down his sweatpants and briefs in one go before he dives back in again, burying his nose at the crook where Jimin\u2019s thigh and pelvis meets.\n\u201cYou smell so good,\u201d Jungkook groans, nibbling at his inner thighs, and Jimin\u2019s so tender and sensitive, his breathing quickens, cock pulsing as Jungkook gets closer. And then Jungkook takes one long kittenish lick at his cock and Jimin\u2019s body jumps, hips bucking up from the bed.\nHe moans, a hand fumbling down, clutching at Jungkook\u2019s hair frantically, the other hand gripping at the pillow next to him. His chest hiccups at every lick, toes flexing, body twitching at the slide of Jungkook\u2019s tongue against him, so firm and wet.\nAnd then Jungkook swallows him whole, overzealous, taking in as much as he can with a glint in his eyes, and Jimin\u2019s body is strung taut like a fishing line, so close to breaking.\n\u201cOh\u2014oh,  fuck,\u201d Jimin whimpers, hips snapping when Jungkook\u2019s tongue swirls around his cock. The head of it keeps grazing the roof of Jungkook\u2019s mouth and everything\u2019s so warm and wet and soft, so good that his toes curl, calves tight and close to cramping. He keeps bucking up with every suck, out of pure reflex, and Jungkook gets fed up with it, shoves Jimin\u2019s hips down into the mattress with a forearm.\nJimin whines and glances down, only to meet Jungkook\u2019s eyes.\nThe plain hunger on his face reminds Jimin of the \u201cstarving Alphas\u201d that Namjoon talked about. His eyes are dark and predatory, like a lion playing with its dinner, toying with its prey before it devours it whole. That intense look makes Jimin\u2019s heart race, blood rushing through his veins at a dizzying speed. He can\u2019t help but squirm in Jungkook\u2019s grip, clutches the pillow closer to him for comfort, the only thing keeping his sanity in check.  \u201cCan you smell me on that?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he stutters, head still in a daze, can\u2019t think of much else but the soft lips rubbing down the side of his cock, the flicker of tongue against the head.\n\u201cOn the pillow,\u201d Jungkook murmurs, low in his throat.\nJimin couldn\u2019t even tell, so surrounded by Jungkook\u2019s scent it\u2019s like he\u2019s been gassed. Everything becomes a blur\u2014\nBut he grabs the pillow just to make sure, turns his head towards his shoulder and sniffs it in, and  fuck  it\u2019s so good. He knew nothing could even compare to Jungkook\u2019s smell, so sweet and warm and dark, like chocolate melting on his tongue. He wants to suffocate on it. His nerves are sizzling, the smell making him so heady he feels like he\u2019s floating.\n\u201cGod, I can smell you dripping even more,\u201d Jungkook rasps. \u201cYou like it, hyung? My scent?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so annoying,\u201d Jimin grits, cheeks burning, too embarrassed to answer his question. He wants to toss the pillow away just to spite him but he can\u2019t let go, the scent so goddamn good that he presses it closer, breathes it in like an oxygen tank, his lungs already bursting full but still not satisfied. He wishes they didn\u2019t have a limit\u2014that he can just breathe Jungkook\u2019s scent in full. A second away from it and it feels like he might drown.\nJungkook doesn\u2019t seem fazed by his non-answer. He just grips the back of Jimin\u2019s knees, rolling him all the way back until Jimin\u2019s hips are off the bed, his body folded nearly in half. Jimin whines, flushing in shame at the way he\u2019s exposed for Jungkook to see. But Jungkook doesn\u2019t give a damn about Jimin\u2019s modesty. He just stares at Jimin\u2019s ass, eyes glazing over at the way the hole twitches so hungrily for him.\n\u201cFuck, just look at you,\u201d Jungkook says thickly. \u201cYou\u2019re so wet for me, hyung.\u201d\nHis fingers rub through the slick, massaging it against Jimin\u2019s skin before he wets his palm with it, uses it as lube to jerk off Jimin\u2019s cock. \u201cSo wet and messy everywhere. So pretty.\u201d\n\u201cJungkook,\u201d he keens, high and breathy, muffled through the pillow. His thighs shake when Jungkook focuses too much on the head, when his palms roll around it, rubbing circles against the tip.\n\u201cGood?\u201d\nJimin nods, doesn\u2019t trust himself to be coherent right now, just tosses his head back and holds on tight.\n\u201cIs my scent making you feel good, hyung? Making you drip?\u201d\n\u201cJungkook\u2014 god, just\u2014shut up and  fuck me already. \u201d\nJungkook groans, stops teasing Jimin\u2019s cock to grab at his ass instead, squeezing it and spreading his cheeks wide. \u201cI really don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna last,\u201d he admits, voice a little scratchy. \u201cI\u2019m gonna come any second now.\u201d\n\u201cSo come first and then fuck me,\u201d Jimin says needily.\nJungkook snarls and nips at his ass, tiny stinging bites all over his skin before he uprights himself, stroking his leaking cock. Jimin\u2019s so gone he doesn\u2019t even remember when Jungkook took off his pants.\n\u201cFuck, why do you have to be so\u2014and your smell\u2014\u201d\nJimin\u2019s breath is short from being folded over, gets even shorter when he sees the way Jungkook looks at him, intoxicated, pupils so blown it\u2019s like he\u2019s high. His knees are almost touching his shoulders from Jungkook rolling him back but he doesn\u2019t give a damn anymore. He just holds onto his thighs and puts himself on display, his shame completely out the window.\nJungkook hisses through his teeth as he strokes, gripping Jimin\u2019s ass with the other hand.\n\u201cWanna mark you. Wanna\u2014wanna come all over you,\u201d he gasps, fingers digging into Jimin\u2019s skin. Jimin stares up at him, dizzy and breathless, head a little drunk from the heat.\n\u201cDo it,\u201d Jimin moans. \u201cCome on me.\u201d\nJungkook grabs his ass so hard Jimin thinks he\u2019ll see bruises in the morning.\n\u201cShit, I\u2019m gonna\u2014\u201d\nThe squelches get louder and wetter. Jungkook\u2019s neck is straining as he pumps, his muscles tensing up, sweat glistening on his skin. Jungkook\u2019s so attractive Jimin\u2019s cock twitches just looking at him.\n\u201cJungkook,\u201d he mewls. \u201cCome on.\u201d \n\u201cSo demanding,\u201d Jungkook grits.\nJimin scrabbles to get a better hold of his thighs, fingers slipping from the sweat, and he fumbles down, spreads his ass instead, presents himself to Jungkook. Jungkook reaches his limit. He groans, positions his cock over Jimin so that he comes all over Jimin\u2019s ass, his cum pumping out hot and wet, mixing in with Jimin\u2019s slick.\nJimin\u2019s body curls in with how good it feels, how satisfied the cum makes him, like the omega in him is purring from being properly marked.\n\u201cYou smell even better with me all over you,\u201d Jungkook says raggedly, struggling to catch his breath.\nHe eases Jimin\u2019s body down, rests Jimin\u2019s ass in his lap as he takes a moment to recover. With a hand, he rubs his cum against Jimin\u2019s hole, massages it into Jimin\u2019s skin like he\u2019s painting with it. The look on Jungkook\u2019s face is reverent, almost entranced. Something about it makes Jimin\u2019s body stir, and he blurts out, \u201cLemme taste.\u201d\nThe hand stills and Jungkook\u2019s head whips up.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d he breathes.\u201cThis is like a dream.\u201d\nThe fingers are damp with a mixture of cum and slick when he brings it up to Jimin\u2019s mouth. He doesn\u2019t let Jimin taste it yet, just smears it across Jimin\u2019s bottom lip like it\u2019s lip balm before he finally dips his fingers in.\nThe cum doesn\u2019t taste the way Jungkook smells\u2014he doesn\u2019t really know what he was expecting. But the idea of tasting Jungkook still gets him hot, and Jungkook\u2019s fingers rubbing against his tongue makes him burn even hotter. Jimin sucks on the fingers like he\u2019s sucking cock, shows Jungkook just how hungry and desperate he is. He swirls his tongue around the tip of Jungkook\u2019s fingers and Jungkook sucks in a breath. Jungkook stares at Jimin\u2019s lips, punch-drunk, entranced, and Jimin is pleased to no end.\nThe fingers leave his mouth too quickly, reaching down to rub at Jimin\u2019s entrance instead.\nJungkook\u2019s index finger breaches him first, slow and tentative, like Jungkook\u2019s not sure it\u2019ll fit. But Jimin sucks it up greedily, takes it all in with a low needy whine. His thighs are shaking, head swimming from how good it feels to be filled up.\n\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t\u2014really know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Jungkook confesses as he adds another finger. Jimin can\u2019t help but prickle in annoyance because of course the golden maknae is good at sex too\u2014god forbid there\u2019s even one thing he sucks at. But he\u2019s grateful, that Jungkook can push aside his pride just for a little bit and be honest instead.\n\u201cS\u2019good,\u201d Jimin mumbles, feet planted on the mattress but knees buckling, legs spreading apart even wider. \u201cYour fingers feel good.\u201d\nJungkook gnaws on his lips like he\u2019s trying to bite back a moan, eyes glazing as he watches the way Jimin swallows up his fingers. His eyes keep flickering between Jimin\u2019s face and Jimin\u2019s ass, like he can\u2019t decide which one makes for a better show.\nWhen Jimin moans, high and breathless, Jungkook settles on watching his face.\n\u201cGood?\u201d Jungkook breathes, awed. Jungkook's fingers are still thrusting in and out of him, prodding against his insides, nice and slow. \u201cHere?\u201d\n\u201cAh,  fuck\u2014\u201d Jimin keens, chest lurching, body strung so tight he\u2019s about to snap. Jungkook\u2019s fingers keep on grazing something as it pushes inside and the constant pressure builds up so good that Jimin\u2019s stomach spasms, legs drawing up.\n\u201cI can feel you tighten around my fingers,\u201d Jungkook rasps, lifting one of Jimin\u2019s legs up so he could watch the fingers go even deeper. He kisses the side of Jimin\u2019s knee and Jimin just stares up at him, dazed and helpless, shivering at the press of Jungkook\u2019s long fingers inside of him. The heat\u2019s built up so high now, the rollercoaster done with its ascent, teetering at the top of the peak, nowhere to go but down. Jungkook\u2019s fingers are bringing him so close to the edge.\n\u201cGod, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d His arms are flailing, gripping at the pillow, at the sheets, at the arm that\u2019s holding up his thigh. His breath is coming faster and faster, a whine building in the back of his throat.\n\u201cWanna see you come all over yourself,\u201d Jungkook murmurs, low and husky, fingers twisting as he thrusts. He puts a hand back on Jimin\u2019s cock but Jimin pushes the hand away with a whimper.\n\u201cNot\u2014not yet.\u201d He tries to get his point across but Jungkook\u2019s fingers are so damn distracting. \u201cJungkook\u2014Jungkook,  hold on,\u201d he says, voice cracking.\nJungkook doesn\u2019t stop, fingers still fucking into him with vigor. But Jimin doesn\u2019t want it like this, doesn\u2019t want the itch to return once he comes. He wants Jungkook\u2019s cock inside of him, his knot stretching him out.  He growls and shoves at Jungkook until he falls backwards.\n\u201cHyung, what\u2014\u201d\nHe loves the gasp that comes when he straddles Jungkook and reaches back for his cock.\n\u201cHyung, are you\u2014are you sure?\u201d\nJimin doesn\u2019t answer, just jerks Jungkook off, memorizes the way his cock feels, so hot and heavy in his hands. It\u2019s thick and veiny, curving towards Jungkook\u2019s stomach, and Jimin can just imagine how good it\u2019ll feel inside of him. He wants it so bad his hands are trembling.\n\u201cHyung, what about\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d \n\nHe lines Jungkook\u2019s cock against his hole and sinks down slowly, lets gravity help him take it in, gripping his own cock with a hand to keep himself from coming too quickly. And god\u2014this is what he\u2019s wanted, what he\u2019s been gagging for.\nJungkook\u2019s mouth is slack, lips parted as Jimin takes him in bit by bit. Jimin wants to burn that awestruck look in his mind forever.\n\u201cGod, you\u2019re so  tight,\u201d Jungkook says, voice straining. His hands are gripping Jimin\u2019s hips and his eyes flicker down, watches the way his cock disappears inside.\nAnd Jimin bottoms out with a gasp, body shivering when his ass is flush against Jungkook\u2019s thighs. It\u2019s so fucking deep and Jungkook\u2019s cock feels so good, filling him up in a way that makes all of his nerves light up.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Jungkook rasps, even though he\u2019s the one that looks overwhelmed. His neck is corded, teeth clenched tight.\nJimin rolls his hips and shows Jungkook just how okay he is, earning himself a ragged moan. And it\u2019s like Jimin comes unleashed, his mind shutting off, losing himself in the sound of Jungkook\u2019s low breaths, in his scent, in the way Jungkook\u2019s cock fills him up. He finally lets himself go, bounces on Jungkook\u2019s cock in a drunken haze, completely lost. His legs want to give out but he keeps going, keeps fucking himself on it, fast and desperate, over and over, just wanting to feel it breach him again and again. It rubs inside of him so good he shivers and throws his head back, chest panting, moaning so loud he hears his voice echoing in the room.\n\u201cJi\u2014Jiminie-hyung,\u201d Jungkook groans, hands fumbling, grabbing onto Jimin\u2019s hips. \u201cGoddammit,  slow down.\u201d But Jimin doesn\u2019t hear him, completely drugged out, heat finally boiling over. He just wants to fuck himself on Jungkook\u2019s cock forever, feel it imprinted inside of him.\n \u201cJimin,\u201d  Jungkook growls in frustration, fingers digging in deep. \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d he moans low in his chest, breath faltering, and his hands grip Jimin\u2019s hips even tighter in an attempt to still it.\n\u201cJungkook,\u201d he whines, leaning back on his palms. His back arches, stomach quivering at the new angle, and his thighs are burning from the way he\u2019s working himself on Jungkook\u2019s cock, riding him frantically. \u201cCome on. Fuck me.\u201d\nJungkook bites his lips so hard they look like they\u2019re about to bleed. His eyes are clenched shut, like he\u2019s trying to dissociate, struggling to keep himself in check. But Jimin doesn\u2019t understand, doesn\u2019t get why Jungkook\u2019s holding himself back when all he wants is Jungkook\u2019s knot inside of him.\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna break, just\u2014fuck me,\u201d Jimin says breathily. \u201cPlease. Want you to wreck me.\u201d  And Jungkook pushes him down in a split second, spreads Jimin\u2019s thighs apart as he snaps his hips and Jimin keens, hands scrabbling at the sheets.\n\u201cYou drive me  crazy,\u201d Jungkook groans, fucking into Jimin at a brutal pace, and Jimin just whines and takes it, jolting when Jungkook rubs against that spot again.\n\u201cOh god\u2014oh fuck,\u201d he heaves, spreads his legs even wider for Jungkook who pounds into him, grabs Jimin by the hips and pulls him down to meet his thrusts. Jimin\u2019s body is burning up so bad it feels like he\u2019s running a fever.\nJimin catches Jungkook\u2019s hands and places them on his chest, wants to feel them grip him all over, wants the rough calluses on his body while Jungkook fucks him, and Jungkook moans, hands moving from Jimin\u2019s ribs, smoothing down his sides, squeezing at his ass. Jimin\u2019s nerves are tingling, toes curling. He feels it building up inside, coiling in his belly.\n\u201cJungkook,\u201d he mewls, his legs shaking. \u201cJungkook, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\nJungkook doesn\u2019t stop, hips still snapping, rutting into Jimin so hard Jimin feels like he\u2019s going to break. Everything\u2019s shattering in front of him and his body\u2019s unraveling like a ball of yarn.\nJimin comes with a high breathy moan, chest heaving as the tension rolls through him, entire body flexing like a bow.\nJungkook just fucks him through his orgasm, harder, deeper, and Jimin gasps with each thrust. He\u2019s starting to feel sore inside but the ache just incites him further, makes his stomach hot, boiling over. Jimin holds onto Jungkook\u2019s shoulders and whines as he takes it, his cock twitching limply with every snap of Jungkook\u2019s hips. Jimin\u2019s body rocks with the force of each thrust, bed creaking, the slapping of skin so loud it\u2019s embarrassing.\nJungkook drops down on an elbow, smothering Jimin with his body before he kisses him, all tongue and teeth, as deeply as he fucks him.\nJimin\u2019s not as edgy as before but he still doesn\u2019t feel satisfied. Won\u2019t be until Jungkook stretches him out with his knot.\n\u201cWant your knot,\u201d Jimin gasps through the kiss, needy and shameless. \u201cKnot me.\u201d\nJungkook groans, cursing as he pounds his hips even faster, relentless.\n\u201cJust wanna wreck you,\u201d Jungkook says deep in his chest. He sucks at Jimin\u2019s neck, thrusts getting sloppier, hips stuttering as he gets close, but even then he manages to hit something that makes Jimin\u2019s body shudder.\n\u201cGonna knot you,\u201d Jungkook rambles. \u201cGonna fill you up with my cum. Make you mine.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Jimin begs.\nHe snaps his hips one last time before he groans, body stilling at the base of Jimin\u2019s ass. Jimin can feel the way Jungkook\u2019s cock pulses inside of him as he comes, and then slowly, there\u2019s the pressure against his rim, the knot growing right at the base.\n\u201cOw, ow\u2014 fuck,\u201d Jimin hisses, wincing as the knot expands, burning him as it stretches.\nJungkook\u2019s breathing heavily on top of him, crushed chest-to-chest.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he sputters. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nHe sounds distressed and Jimin\u2019s irritable, overwhelmed from the knot growing inside of him. \u201cI told you to stop apologizing,\u201d he says, words broken as the knot stretches him further.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I should\u2019ve\u2014controlled myself better at least,\u201d he says, muffled against Jimin\u2019s neck. He\u2019s still struggling to catch his breath but after a moment, he continues, more tentative than Jimin expects. \u201cI just\u2014I have no clue what I\u2019m doing. But I like you, hyung. And not just because you\u2019re an omega.\u201d\n\u201cBut the omega part doesn\u2019t hurt, right?\u201d Jimin says with a snort.\nJungkook\u2019s voice is small when he answers, \u201cBut that\u2019s not why I like you. That\u2019s not all you are, y\u2019know?\u201d  And it\u2019s like the fog has cleared. Jimin realizes with stunning clarity that he\u2019s been judging Jungkook a little too quickly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good Alpha,\u201d he says, hoping it makes up for all the words he spewed earlier, when he was too caught up in his own anger.\nJungkook\u2019s head lifts, face still flushed from orgasm. His eyes are tender, soft, like that\u2019s all he\u2019s been waiting to hear, but his lips betray his eyes. They\u2019re still pursed. Skeptic.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he says with a self-deprecating laugh. \u201cBecause I feel like I fuck up so much. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing half the time.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing? At least you have people showing you. I\u2019ve got nothing. It was all trial by fire.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re doing fine,\u201d Jungkook says gently.  He gets on his elbows, rearranges himself so that he can see Jimin\u2019s face more clearly, but his knot shifts in the process, sending a spark through Jimin, awakening his nerves. He gasps, tightening around the knot involuntarily, and Jungkook groans back, grinds his hips against Jimin even more.\n\u201cHyung, we\u2019re not gonna stop at this rate.\u201d\n\u201cFeels too good,\u201d Jimin mumbles with a roll of his hips. His body\u2019s finally sated, no longer itching, but he\u2019s getting aroused again from the way the knot rubs up against him, the pain of the stretch receding, melting into something so good that his brain short-circuits. He can\u2019t help but grind against it again, relishing in the feel of Jungkook\u2019s cock\u2014and the idea of Jungkook pumping cum into him, marking him from the inside out, fuck. He just felt an excited tremor run through his chest.\n\u201cHyung, I\u2019m trying to be  serious  here, and you\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re so distracting,\u201d he grits, gripping onto Jimin\u2019s hips again to keep him from thrusting.\n\u201cI was thinking about your cum,\u201d Jimin says, overheated. \u201cMarking me inside.\u201d\n\u201cGod, how am I supposed to control myself around you?\u201d Jungkook groans.\nJimin replies, \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d but Jungkook just looks down at him, stunned.\n\u201cYou\u2019re heavy,\u201d Jimin complains after a minute. \u201cRoll over.\u201d\nJungkook sighs exaggeratedly but does it anyway, wraps his arms around Jimin\u2019s waist and flips them until Jimin\u2019s lying on top of him.\n\u201cHow much longer are we stuck for anyway?\u201d Jimin asks, circling his hips.\nJungkook gasps, looks up glassy-eyed as Jimin clenches around him, rutting back against Jungkook\u2019s hips.\n\u201cI\u2014don\u2019t know,\u201d Jungkook says, gripping Jimin\u2019s thighs. \u201cHow much longer is your heat?\u201d\n\u201cDunno,\u201d he says, words slurring, head rolling back from the pleasure. When Jungkook drives his hips up, his body jerks, overstimulated, and Jungkook gives him a smug little grin.\n\"Let\u2019s find out then.\u201d\n\nThey say that Alphas differ from omegas in at least four distinct ways. And begrudgingly, Jimin has to agree, because his own ethnographic research kind of supports it.\n\n\n\nCase Study #1:\n\n\nHis size is a dead giveaway for his non-Alphaness.\n\n\nHe\u2019s the same height as Yoongi, but the Alpha hormones must fuck with Yoongi\u2019s spatial skills because he teases Jimin about his height along with the rest of the members.\n\n\nJungkook teases Jimin about his height the most, never lets Jimin forget about the size difference, jokes about it with the biggest smile on his face.\n\n\nBut in private he says that Jimin\u2019s the best size for a backhug. He says it\u2019s because his head can rest so comfortably on Jimin\u2019s shoulder, right at the base of his neck, the part that Jungkook likes the most.\n\n\nAnd Jimin rolls his eyes, but he has to admit that he likes the way he fits against Jungkook too, likes Jungkook\u2019s body draped over his own.\n\n\nWhen Jungkook\u2019s smothering him in bed, a heavy arm draped over his side, Jimin asks somewhat seriously, \u201cWhat if I was a tall omega?\u201d\n\n\nJungkook pulls him in tighter and mumbles into his neck, \u201cDon\u2019t care as long as I\u2019m the big spoon.\u201d\n\n\n\nCase Study #2:\n\n\nOmega pheromones have an adverse effect on muscle mass.\n\n\nExcept when it comes to his ass, much to Jungkook\u2019s delight, who grabs it and pats it whenever he gets the chance.\n\n\nAnd when the noonas give him yet another oversized sweater, Jungkook bites his lips and says to Jimin, \u201cI want you to wear my sweater instead,\u201d and Jimin slaps him on the arm, tells him to get lost.\n\n\nBut Jimin grabs one of Jungkook\u2019s sweaters to wear anyway, just because he likes the scent wrapped all around him.\n\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t hurt that Jungkook\u2019s eyes track him whenever he has it on. \n\n\n\u201cLike it when you wear my clothes,\u201d Jungkook murmurs, after he\u2019s jerked Jimin off, made him come all over the sweater. \u201cYou smell like you\u2019re mine.\u201d\n\n\nCase Study #3:\n\n\nEven if he can get himself to look like an Alpha, he can\u2019t get himself to smell like one.\n\n\nBut that\u2019s fine, because he likes the way Jungkook gets lost in his scent\u2014the satisfied sigh he breathes out whenever they\u2019re hugging and Jungkook buries his nose in Jimin\u2019s neck, forgetting to control himself on camera.\n\n\nHe still doesn\u2019t know what he smells like, but apparently, he\u2019s starting to smell more and more like Jungkook, because the hyungs know what happened the second they came back to the dorms.\n\n\nJimin had wanted to keep it a secret for a while (much to Jungkook\u2019s chagrin), but that was shot down pretty quickly after Yoongi took one whiff of him and said, \u201cYou reek of Jungkook.\u201d And frankly, after the frantic heatsex they had, he\u2019s not surprised.\n\n\nJungkook overhears and smiles triumphantly, chest puffing out in pride. Jimin shoots him a dirty glare, but ends up wearing Jungkook\u2019s shirts and sweaters anyway. Likes the way the scent soaks into him, bleeds into his skin.\n\n\nAnd Jungkook likes it too, tells Jimin he smells the best when he wears Eau de Jungkook.\n\n\n\nCase Study #4:\n\n\nJimin has made it a habit to catch himself doing non-Alpha things, throwing an arm over Jungkook\u2019s shoulder, ordering him around on camera. And Jungkook\u2019s okay with it, doesn\u2019t let his Alpha pride get in the way.\n\n\nIn private, Jungkook\u2019s the one ordering him around, pinning him on the bed and talking to him in a way that\u2019s way too comfortable (and explicit) for anything on broadcast. And Jimin lets him do it because he doesn\u2019t mind bending to him, too eager to please. \n\n\nBut Jungkook\u2019s getting bolder and bolder, holding onto Jimin possessively, saying dangerous things on camera, and when Jimin calls him out on it, all Jungkook does is say, \u201cWhy do I have to be careful around the person that I like?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like me,\u201d Jimin goads. \u201cYou just want me because I\u2019m a yummy little omega.\u201d\n\n\nJungkook stares at him incredulously.\n\n\n\u201cYou and I both know you make a terrible omega. So that\u2019s definitely not it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell\u2014you\u2019re not that much of an Alpha either,\u201d Jimin sputters.\n\n\nSurprisingly, Jungkook just beams.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d he says.\n\n\nJimin thinks so too.\n"
