    "text": "\nWhen Percy wakes up, he\u2019s drowning.\n\n\nOnly metaphorically, though.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy blinks up at the foggy green water, then down at his stubby-fingered baby hands. There goes all of puberty\u2019s hard work.\u00a0\n\n\nHe pats his pockets. No Riptide.\u00a0\n\n\nThat\u2019s definitely not a good sign.\n\n\nAs he watches a beat up old lighter swim past him with the catfish, Percy tries to direct his thoughts away from \n\nWhat the fuck what the fuck I can\u2019t believe this is actually happening\n\n and towards figuring out why he\u2019s lying at the bottom of trash river right now. Seriously. Percy looks down at his new (old?) body. He\u2019s thigh deep in mud, surrounded by garbage, and looks like he just took a blast from Festus. So he could really be at any point in the last six years of his short, miserable life.\n\n\nGreat.\n\n\nThen he hears a voice that sounds almost like his mom.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPercy, what do you say?\n\n\n\n\u201cAh, shit,\u201d Percy says. \u201cI mean,\u201d he adds, \u201cthank you, Father. And thank you,\u201d he says to the ghostly figure in the current.\n\n\nThe Nereid smiles.\n\n\nPercy actually remembers this now. Kind of. But if this really is after the Chimera thing, then that means\u2014\n\n\nThe muck swirls around, revealing the glow of Riptide not five feet in front of him.\n\n\n\nTake the sword, Percy\n\n, says the Nereid.\n\n\nYes! Percy surges forward, caps Riptide, then returns it to his pocket. He lets out a breath, immediately feeling a thousand times better.\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he says, trying not to cringe at his puny twelve-year-old voice. He doesn\u2019t even want to imagine what it sounds like above water.\n\n\nThe Nereid\u2019s form flickers. \n\nBefore you descend into the Underworld, go to the beach in Santa Monica\n\n, she says.\n\n It is your father\u2019s will.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d Percy nods. If everything goes according to plan, he\u2019ll need a much bigger favor than the one she granted him the first time around.\n\n\nThe Nereid reaches towards him, and cool water caresses his cheek.\u00a0\n\nYour father believes in you, brave one, the Nereid says. Her faint glow is almost drowned out by a passing swirl of debris. Good luck, she finishes, and do not trust the gifts given by those who have reason to betray you!\u00a0\n\nAs the Nereid\u2019s image melts away, Percy wonders if he would\u2019ve been able to understand her warning if he\u2019d heard the whole thing last time.\u00a0\n\n\nProbably not. Then again, it doesn\u2019t matter now.\n\n\nPercy surveys the bloated brown river and wishes he had a sand dollar. He\u2019ll have to remember to bring one next time he comes around.\n\n\nBefore willing the current to propel him to the surface, Percy turns to the dark water and repeats, \u201cThank you, Father.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you down,\u201d he adds.\n\n\nNot yet, at least.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t leave you alone for five minutes!\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like being yelled at by a twelve-year-old version of your girlfriend. Who\u2019s probably your ex-girlfriend now, Percy reflects, considering that it might be a little weird to push a ton of love and affection on a person who hasn\u2019t experienced the events that the love and affection stem from. It definitely wouldn\u2019t be fair to expect the same deep emotional connection and understanding from an Annabeth whom he hasn\u2019t fought through two wars and one Tartarus with.\u00a0\n\n\nBut, at least she\u2019s not afraid of him.\n\n\nShe\u2018s also several inches taller than he is, which Percy isn\u2019t bitter about at all.\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Grover bleats into Percy\u2019s neck. He\u2019s much squishier than the Grover Percy\u2019s used to, but his bear-hug (goat hug?) is still the same amount of comforting.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy pats him on the back before prying him off and shuffling both of his mini-friends away from the paramedics and into the crowd.\n\n\n\u201cAn Australian anteater set her chihuahua son on me,\u201d Percy tells them, \u201cand then he set me on fire.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Annabeth says.\n\n\n\u201cHe also tried to poison me to death before pushing me off the Arch,\u201d Percy nods thoughtfully. It\u2019s all coming back to him now. \u201cSorry, Annabeth,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut this one isn\u2019t going on my list of favorite architectural icons.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMe neither,\u201d Grover agrees, eyes wide.\n\n\n\u201cAll things considered, I\u2019m okay with that,\u201d Annabeth says. She looks a bit sick.\n\n\nPercy relays the whole your-father-calls-you-to-Santa-Monica thing to them as well, sans the gifts part. They don\u2019t have to worry about that. He\u2019ll take care of it.\n\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Grover says. \u201cWe have to get you to Santa Monica. You can\u2019t ignore a summons from your dad!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t planning to,\u201d Percy shrugs.\u00a0\n\n\nSince Percy has spent years travelling around the world, doing stupid favors for the gods and trying not to get maimed or killed, he doesn\u2019t really remember the specifics of this particular trip. It\u2019s pretty bad. Percy should probably feel ashamed of this, but then again, there isn\u2019t anyone left to shame him.\u00a0\n\n\nAnyway, he\u2019s about to subtly ask about how they\u2019re planning to get to California when\u2014\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Dan. Percy Jackson. Channel Twelve has learned that the boy who may have caused this explosion fits the description of a young man wanted by authorities for a serious New Jersey bus accident\u2014\u201d\n\n\nRight. Almost forgot about that.\n\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Annabeth hisses, tugging on Percy\u2019s sleeve, and all three of them duck into an alley.\n\n\nAfter a moment of consideration, Percy sticks his head back out into the street.\n\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Grover asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s with that weird look on your face?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust trying to figure out if turning me in will get us enough bounty money to buy our way to LA.\u201d Percy says, craning his neck towards the news van.\n\n\n\u201cWe are not turning you in to the police.\u201d Grover presses his head back into the alleyway.\n\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Percy says. They could use a bit of cash. \u201cYou guys can just break me out afterwards, right?\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth looks like she\u2019s considering it.\n\n\n\u201cNo, guys,\u201d Grover says. \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAnd then he quickly trots them back to the Amtrak station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nPercy spends the rest of his evening lounging on a lumpy train cushion, soaking up the remaining sunlight while Grover dozes on his shoulder. It\u2019s nice. While he and Annabeth had been taking their unplanned tour of Tartarus, sometimes he had wondered if he\u2019d ever feel warm again.\u00a0\n\n\nSometimes he still wonders that.\n\n\nAnnabeth sits opposite him, staring out the window. If Percy gets done what he wants to get done, then she\u2019ll be able to spend the rest of her life taking this golden sunset for granted. That\u2019s worth the loss of a friend who can understand the chill of the pit.\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you staring at me?\u201d Annabeth says, without turning her gaze from the window.\n\n\n\u201cThinking.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t know you could do that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Percy protests half-heartedly, and Annabeth cracks a grin. She looks so young.\n\n\nShe is so young.\n\n\nTwelve-year-old Annabeth doesn\u2019t boast the easy confidence of her future (past?) self. She obviously still has her pride, but it\u2019s fragile, stretched thin. The tough skin of a leafy plant starving for rain.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy can see the way she\u2019s curling in on herself more clearly than when he was here the first time around, when he was just another kid doing his best to keep himself from hurting.\n\n\nShe\u2019ll grow out of it, in the future. After all, if even Percy could do it, so can she. But, it took time. It took years. And the moments in between weren\u2019t exactly comfortable. Percy knows how awful it is to be stuck in your own head with only yourself for company.\n\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he says, trying to summon the words Annabeth herself once told him. \u201cYou know you have intrinsic value as a person\u2014no matter what you do or don\u2019t do\u2014and regardless of how much recognition others give you, right?\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth turns from the unending fields of hay barrels to scrunch up her face at Percy, confused.\n\n\n\u201cDid you hit your head at the Arch, too?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Percy says, somewhat offended. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2014really glad you came on this crazy quest with me. You\u2019re really smart and really brave, and you shouldn\u2019t have to prove that. Anyone with eyes can see it. You\u2019re a good friend, Annabeth, and I wouldn\u2019t want to walk into the Underworld with anyone else.\u201d\n\n\nA pause. They pass a row of pine trees, and sunlight scatters across the inside of the train.\n\n\nAnnabeth blinks. She looks surprised.\n\n\nThen\u2014\u201cYou\u2019re acting weird,\u201d she snorts, turning back to the fields. \u201cWe better get some food in you soon. The hunger is obviously making you delirious.\u201d\n\n\nPercy shrugs. After watching Annabeth deliberately not look at him for a couple of seconds, he leans to the side and presses his forehead against the cool glass of the window.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s okay if she doesn\u2019t get it yet. She will. Percy just wanted to say it to her at least once, since he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll get the chance to say it again and have her listen.\n\n\nNot even the Fates can predict the future now.\n\n\nA trip through Tartarus can teach anyone the risks of sleeping while exposed, but it\u2019s not every day that Percy gets thrown six hundred feet down and six years back into a dirty river. The warmth and rumble of the train have just about rocked Percy into a doze when he hears, very faintly, something that sounds like\u2014\n\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\nBathed in the sunset\u2019s orange light, Annabeth almost looks like she\u2019s blushing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nPercy uses the twenty seconds Grover and Annabeth spend setting up an Iris-message in the car wash telling himself not to cry or punch anything. Annabeth gives him a weird look when he hands over the requested drachma, so he thinks that he\u2019s doing a pretty bad job at hiding his nerves, but then he remembers that he forgot to ask what I-Ming was.\u00a0\n\n\nYeah. Percy\u2019s really great at this time travel thing.\n\n\n\u201cHalf-Blood Hill,\u201d Annabeth calls.\n\n\nThe carwash mist swirls into the sight of strawberry fields and the Long Island Sound in the distance. There\u2019s the porch of the Big House, and standing there, staring down at the meadow, is\u2014\n\n\n\u201cLuke!\u201d Grover bleats excitedly.\n\n\nLuke turns.\n\n\nPercy has to clench his hands to keep them from shaking. He\u2019d forgotten what Luke had looked like before becoming Kronos\u2019s host, before getting pushed off a cliff, before leaving camp, before everything. Not being possessed by a Titan lord is a good look for him..\n\n\n\u201cPercy! Annabeth!\u201d Luke calls. \u201cAnd Grover, you there, too? Thank the gods! Are you guys okay?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fine!\u201d Annabeth says in a high pitched voice. She\u2019s trying to comb back her hair with her fingers. It\u2019s been a while since they\u2019ve been able to take a shower.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy feels self conscious, too, though it\u2019s for a different reason. He is suddenly very aware that he looks like a twelve-year-old kid who recently got set on fire and dragged through a river of garbage, and he\u2019s standing in front of his former (future?) archenemy.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re\u2014\u201d Annabeth starts, unable to meet Luke\u2019s gaze. \u201cI mean\u2014I thought Chiron\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s down at the cabins. We\u2019ve been having issues with some of the campers,\u201d Luke frowns. \u201cBut, never mind all that. Is everything cool with you guys?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWait, what sort of issues?\u201d Grover interjects.\n\n\nLuke opens his mouth, but before he can speak, a huge Lincoln Continental pulls into the stall next door. Annabeth immediately takes this for the escape opportunity it is, shoving the hose into Percy\u2019s hands and ducking out of the call. She drags Grover with her, so they can go terrify a couple of asshole grownups together. Fun.\n\n\nPercy is left staring at a guy who he spent four years alternately trying not to get killed by and trying to kill. A guy who\u2019s smiling at him as if he isn\u2019t actively plotting to send him into Tartarus right now.\n\n\nPercy wonders if his powers over water allow him to transfer a punch over I-M..\n\n\n\u201cChiron had to break up a fight,\u201d Luke shouts over the music. He looks worried, still pretending he isn\u2019t the one responsible for everyone fighting in the first place. \u201cThings are pretty tense over here. Word leaked out about the Zeus-Poseidon standoff, and we\u2019re\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019ve you been sleeping, Luke?\u201d Percy says.\n\n\nLuke goes still.\u00a0\n\n\nFor a moment, the only noise is the sound of the bass shuddering through the concrete.\n\n\nThen Luke smiles wryly, running his hand through his hair. \u201cNot so well, to be honest. I\u2019ve been worried about\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStill having bad dreams?\u201d Percy isn\u2019t sure if this is how Luke always looks after he\u2019s spent a night being tormented by Kronos. He still looks so much better than the hard-faced man in Percy\u2019s memories, the scar always fresh on his cheek.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDreams?\u201d Luke laughs. He sounds nervous. \u201cSorry, Percy, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\n\nPercy tilts his head to one side, studying Luke\u2019s face.\u00a0\n\n\nThen he says, \u201cThey\u2019ll stop soon.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe dreams. You don\u2019t have to worry about them. They\u2019ll stop.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPercy,\u201d Luke says slowly. His eyes are narrowed, and it makes him look more like the Luke that Percy remembers. \u201cPercy, have you\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSee you later, Luke,\u201d Percy interrupts. Then he disperses the spray of water.\u00a0\n\n\nThe hail of frozen mist shatters on the ground, the hose empty thirteen seconds before the timer runs out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnabeth is visibly disappointed when she doesn\u2019t chase away the Lincoln Continental in time to catch one last glimpse of Luke. It\u2019s okay, though. Percy isn\u2019t planning on making it easy for Luke to break his promise this time around.\n\n\nBut, truthfully, Percy\u2019s not very optimistic about this. His plans don\u2019t usually go according to plan.\n\n\nCase in point:\n\n\n\u201cYou are not going into the creepy defunct theme park pool alone.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAnnabeth folds her arms, suddenly looking so similar to her future self that Percy feels like he\u2019s being gutted with a fish knife.\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d he says. \u201cYou want to do the Thrill Ride O\u2019 Love. With me.\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth glances at the sign, her face going red, and then whips her head to the side. \u201cYou\u2019re just making it weird by saying it like that.\u201d\n\n\nPercy glances at Grover, who raises his hands in the universal gesture for \n\nDon\u2019t look at me, dude\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be gross,\u201d Percy says. \u201cAnd wet. And there\u2019ll probably be spiders.\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth turns pale, but quickly retorts, \u201cSpiders? In a pool?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cBesides, this looks too easy. What if it\u2019s a trap?\u201d\n\n\nPercy shrugs. \u201cThen I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUm,\u201d Grover interjects, \u201cNo offense, but the last time we left you somewhere alone, you fell six hundred feet into the Mississippi. While on fire.\u201d\n\n\nPercy can\u2019t deny that.\n\n\n\u201cFace it, Seaweed Brain,\u201d Annabeth says, walking towards the edge of the empty pool. \u201cYou need someone to watch your back.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d Percy cuts ahead of her. \u201cBut I reserve the right to say I told you so.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI told you so!\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth glares at Percy like she\u2019s about to unleash a really smart comeback, but it just comes out as \u201cAaaah!\u201d since one of Hephaestus\u2019s spider robots has gotten close enough to snag her shirt.\n\n\nPercy bashes it on the head with Riptide and sends it flying against the wall of the pool. Then he kicks two of its friends away and drags Annabeth, who\u2019s still shrieking, towards Ares and Aphrodite\u2019s little love boat, while Grover swoops above them on Luke\u2019s flying shoes, shouting and tugging at the golden net that\u2019s trapping them.\n\n\nGood times.\n\n\nExcept not really, because Percy isn\u2019t used to fighting in his puny preteen body yet, and it shows. Last time he was twelve, he got through a lot of his fights by relying on Riptide to guide him. He grew out of that as time went on, and now it\u2019s working against him.\u00a0\n\n\nAs Percy works on decapitating the last couple of spiders standing between them and the water park ride from Hades, he under-extends on a swipe and one of the spiders gets a slash in.\n\n\nIt\u2019s embarrassing, really. He\u2019s fighting worse than he did when he was actually twelve.\n\n\n\u201cHold on,\u201d Percy says, buckling Annabeth into the boat. Then, with a twitch of his hand, he summons the ocean to Waterland.\n\n\nOver the sound of spider robots sparking and smashing into the bottom of the pool, Percy shouts, \u201cMeet you on the other side!\u201d to Grover, who\u2019s gaping at the water shooting out of the pipes and washing them into the Tunnel of Love.\n\n\nIs it just Percy, or is this ride even rockier this time around? He\u2019s pretty sure they didn\u2019t take out the Romeo and Juliet cutouts last time. Or smash into the walls.\u00a0\n\n\nAnnabeth is still screaming when Percy straps on Ares\u2019s shield, unbuckles her seatbelt, and grabs her hand. Then he uses the water to throw them over the locked gate, boat and all.\n\n\nPercy might be laughing when they reach the top of their arc. Or maybe that\u2019s just the adrenaline.\u00a0\n\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s him and Annabeth, falling together. Again.\n\n\nThe collar of his shirt jerks him up and back out of his memories.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got you!\u201d Grover yelps.\n\n\nAnd then all three of them are tumbling towards the concrete.\n\n\nOh.\n\n\nIt looks like a very hard fall.\n\n\n\nPercy! Water!\n\n\n\nRight. Percy shakes himself back together.\n\n\nTwo seconds before they kiss the ground, the water from the Tunnel of Love swirls up and around them like a geyser, swallowing them whole.\n\n\nThe impact doesn\u2019t hurt. Percy lowers his friends to the ground before letting all the water splash away.\u00a0\n\n\nAnnabeth is coughing, and Grover is snorting up chlorinated pool water, but they don\u2019t look like they\u2019re hurt. They\u2019re just soaked.\n\n\nPercy reaches out and dries them both off before turning back to the creeper Cupid statues, who are still pointing their spotlights in their direction.\u00a0\n\n\nHe waves and calls, \u201cShow\u2019s over! Thank you! Good night!\u201d\n\n\nThe lights power down.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy sighs.\u00a0\n\n\nThat\u2019s one annoyance dealt with. Twenty billion more to go.\n\n\n\u201cPercy,\u201d Annabeth cries, \u201cyour arm!\u201d\n\n\nPercy looks down. There\u2019s an ugly cut decorating the inside of his sword arm, tracing his vein from elbow to palm.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a scratch.\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth screws her face up. \u201cI can see inside your wrist,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s way more of me than you ever wanted to see?\u201d Percy offers.\u00a0\n\n\nShe glares. \u201cDon\u2019t make this into a joke.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBlame the blood loss.\u201d The convenient, convenient blood loss.\n\n\n\u201cWater,\u201d Grover says frantically, \u201cyou\u2019ll be okay once we dip you in some water.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUh.\u201d Percy looks at the empty pool, then at the wet concrete surrounding them. \u201cThat might be a problem.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGrover,\u201d Annabeth says. Her voice is the kind of calm that means she\u2019s actually freaking out on the inside. \u201cGo grab a bottle of water from the gift shop.\u201d\n\n\nGrover immediately lifts off, but then Percy grabs his ankle. \u201cNo, it\u2019s good,\u201d he insists. \u201cJust give me a second\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\u2014To bleed out?\u201d Grover yelps. Luke\u2019s shoes flutter like hummingbirds, straining at Percy\u2019s grip. \u201cWait, do gift shops even have water? Wha\u2014\n\nDi immortales\n\n, Percy, I can feel your blood dripping into my socks\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGrover, gift shop,\u201d Annabeth orders. She pries Percy\u2019s fingers off of Grover\u2019s now bloody ankle, then guides his hand up until he looks like a kid who\u2019s trying to ask his teacher a very urgent question about whether or not he can go to the nurse\u2019s office. \u201cI\u2019ll go check the food court. Percy, elevate your arm, put pressure on the wound, and whatever you do, don\u2019t die.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d Percy says, giving her a thumbs up with his non-elevated hand.\u00a0\n\n\nAnnabeth shoots him a stern look, and then she and Grover are racing off to help him. As they always do.\n\n\nOnce they\u2019re out of sight, Percy slumps to the ground, sitting on the wet concrete that\u2019s slowly becoming even more wet from his blood.\n\n\nTime to get down to business.\n\n\nOpposite Percy, there are a couple of sad yellow bushes sitting in a trench of dry mulch by the Tunnel of Love\u2019s exit.\u00a0\n\n\nThey\u2019ll do.\n\n\nPercy closes his eyes and thinks about streams and waterfalls and the flow of water over his skin and down his fingers. When he feels a tugging at his gut, he opens his eyes to see blood pouring from his arm, rolling under the gate, and splashing into the dirt under the bushes like a little red river meeting the sea.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s like he\u2019s donating blood to the drying corpse of Waterland.\u00a0\n\n\nOkay, that\u2019s a wonderful image. Good one, Percy.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy stares straight ahead and grinds his teeth. The part of himself that he shattered in Tartarus shifts like a dislocated joint, strange and loose and constantly tiptoeing on the edge of incredible pain.\n\n\nThis better be worth it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cRemember our deal,\u201d Percy tells the dampening mulch.\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t stop until he hears his friends coming back for him.\n\n\nThe first thing Percy does once Ares literally hands him the thing they accepted a cross-country quest to look for is almost rip the stupid backpack apart.\u00a0\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t really know what he\u2019s looking for. A secret pocket? A big red button? A tab that says \u201cPull to summon Zeus\u2019s Master Bolt\u201d?\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Annabeth asks.\n\n\nPercy stops upending the backpack and shows her what\u2019s inside. \u201cNothing but Oreos,\u201d he says. \u201cCan demigods get scurvy?\u201d\n\n\nWhile Annabeth gives her lecture on the effects of ambrosia and nectar on counteracting mortal nutrient deficiencies, Percy sulks as quietly as he can. Looks like Ares\u2019s magic trick is smarter than he is.\u00a0\n\n\nThat sucks. Percy had been hoping that Annabeth and Grover could take the Master Bolt right now and ride the zebra back to Olympus.\u00a0\n\n\nSo that\u2019s one plan nixed already.\n\n\nPercy\u2019s bad mood lasts through their sneaking onto the Kindness International truck, feeding and watering the other wild animals, de-ballooning the antelope thing, and Grover angrily falling asleep in a pile of hay. Hopefully he and Annabeth think Percy\u2019s just angry about the animals.\n\n\nGrover makes a snorting noise that\u2019s audible over the rumble of the truck. It should be loud enough to wake him up, but it doesn\u2019t.\n\n\n\u201cHow does he do that?\u201d Percy marvels.\n\n\n\u201cNatural talent, probably.\u201d Annabeth twists an Oreo in half and hands the icing side to him.\n\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Annabeth shoves her cookie half into her mouth. \u201cWhat did Luke say in his I-M?\u201d\n\n\nLies and manipulation. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty worried about you,\u201d Percy says. \u201cYou guys close?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Annabeth stares down at the ravaged Oreo package. Though the glow from Riptide keeps the truck from being completely dark, it\u2019s impossible to read her expression. \u201cHe and Thalia found me when I was seven. He was fourteen, she was twelve. But, they were\u2014\u201d She hesitates. \u201cIt sounds stupid, but they were almost like parents to me then. They did everything I thought real parents would do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey protected you,\u201d Percy offers. \u201cCared for you unconditionally.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Annabeth says quietly. The Oreo packaging crinkles in her hands. After a moment, she turns to Percy and asks, \u201cYour mom, is she\u2026?\u201d\n\n\nPercy holds back the wave of agony and says, as steadily as he can, \u201cShe\u2019s the nicest person you\u2019ll ever meet.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou sure you\u2019re her kid then?\u201d Annabeth teases.\n\n\n\u201cHey, she has a rebellious streak, too. One time, she got into a big argument with my stepdad because he said that blue food doesn\u2019t exist, and the next day she came back from work with five pounds of blue candy. She\u2019s baked me blue birthday cake every year since. You\u2019ve gotta try it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was wondering about the blue food,\u201d Annabeth smiles. Her teeth glint with Riptide\u2019s light, and Percy can see that she\u2019s fiddling with her dad\u2019s ring on her bead necklace.\n\n\n\u201cYou never think about living with your dad again?\u201d he asks.\n\n\nA long silence.\n\n\nThen\u2014\u201cI tried once,\u201d she says stiffly. \u201cDidn\u2019t work out so well. I was back at camp before Christmas.\u201d\n\n\nA long silence.\n\n\nPercy lets those words lie, unsure of how well twelve-year-old Annabeth will take comfort from a kid she doesn\u2019t really know and still has reason to hate right now.\u00a0\n\n\nBut, he can\u2019t not try.\n\n\nSlowly, Percy moves his hand until his pinky finger is hugging hers.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d he says quietly.\n\n\n\u201cI know that.\u201d Annabeth\u2019s response is immediate and cold, but she hasn\u2019t ripped her hand away or suplexed him yet, which seems like a good sign.\n\n\n\u201cIt really wasn\u2019t,\u201d Percy insists. When he spots her shoulders hunching, he decides to change tack, adding, \u201cAnyway, you still have Luke and the Athena cabin. And everyone at camp. And Grover and me. We\u2019re kind of family, right?\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth wrinkles her nose. \u201cTechnically, yeah. But, the gods don\u2019t really have DNA, so we\u2019re not genetically related, and frankly, it\u2019d be bad if we were, considering the amount of intercabin dating\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay, \n\nso\n\n not my point here,\u201d Percy interrupts. It\u2019s really best not to chase that line of thought. \u201cI just wanted to say that you can choose your family, you know? It\u2019s not all about who gave birth to you. Or whose brain you magically bounced out of in a golden cradle.\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth gives him a weighty look.\u00a0\n\n\nThen she punches him in the shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cOw!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou watched too much PBS as a kid,\u201d she says, as if she\u2019s not a kid herself. \u201cBut, you\u2019re right, I guess. Even if Thalia is...gone, I still have Luke. And everyone at camp.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd me,\u201d says the caveman part of Percy\u2019s brain that\u2019s still clinging to his memories of future Annabeth.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known you for like a month,\u201d Annabeth points out.\n\n\nPercy shrugs, trying not to look too hurt. She\u2019s not wrong, obviously. Annabeth still doesn\u2019t really know Percy. She hasn\u2019t gone through the things they went through together in his future-past. She doesn\u2019t remember the things he does.\n\n\nAnd she never will.\n\n\n\u201cBut, yeah,\u201d Annabeth says quietly, not meeting his eyes. \u201cAnd you.\u201d\n\n\nHer pinky curls around his.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercy leans back, his eyes closed, and lets his head knock against the wall of the truck until Annabeth\u2019s breathing has slowed into that familiar rhythm which says she\u2019s sleeping deep. Then he opens his eyes and carefully untangles his hand from hers.\n\n\nBecause Percy doesn\u2019t want to greet his mom with a new piercing, he should really use this time to practice his swordplay, but the uneven jerking of the truck quickly convinces him that waving Riptide around in here would be a really bad idea. So, instead, he summons a couple droplets of water from the lion\u2019s bowl and approaches the zebra\u2019s cage.\n\n\n\nLord?\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, buddy,\u201d Percy says, the water spinning above his fingertips like three tiny razor blades. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get that gum out of your mane?\u201d\n\n\nPercy has just sheared the last string of Hubba Babba from the zebra\u2019s neck when he hears\u2014\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Percy startles. One droplet nicks a bar of the cage before Percy remembers to let go, sending the water splattering harmlessly to the floor.\n\n\nGrover clears his throat, but his voice is still hoarse when he repeats, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault that Thalia is gone.\u201d\n\n\nSomeone\u2019s been eavesdropping.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Percy sighs, \u201cit isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut it is,\u201d Grover says sadly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know, Percy. It was. I\u2014\u201d\n\n\nAnd Percy knows that he should let Grover talk. It\u2019s like draining an infected wound, talking about stuff like this. But, he suddenly feels so angry. Not with Grover. Not with Annabeth or Thalia or even Luke. He\u2019s just so mad that each one of them, deep down, believes that everything bad that\u2019s happened in their life is their fault. He\u2019s mad because they think it\u2019s their duty to fix the whole entire world, when they should be able to spend their time worrying about stupid things like failing tests and asking out their crushes, not fighting monsters and gods and their parents. They shouldn\u2019t believe that their friends died because of them. They shouldn\u2019t feel like they have to prove themselves to be worth something. They are lovable, and have always deserved to be loved, and their being shown the opposite has not been their fault.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy wants to tell them this, repeatedly, constantly, in the hopes that if he says it enough times, they will finally believe him. Believe in themselves.\n\n\nBut they won\u2019t.\u00a0\n\n\nNo matter how much Percy tries, he won\u2019t be able to wash clean the old wounds left by other people. Water can heal, but the sea tears things down.\n\n\nThat\u2019s the only thing Percy\u2019s good at.\n\n\nSo, his voice is harsher than he wants it to be when he lunges towards Grover and says, \u201cDid you set the Furies on Thalia? Did you try to hurt her? Stab her, slash her, make her bleed? Did you try to kill her? Did you turn her into a pine tree?\u201d\n\n\nGrover\u2019s eyes are wide, and it\u2019s only when he leans back and away that Percy notices he\u2019s looming over him like a bully.\n\n\nCheeks burning, Percy scoots backwards, plopping down into the hay.\n\n\nA tense silence falls.\n\n\nFinally, Grover whispers, \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\nPercy has just about forgotten what question Grover\u2019s answering at this point, but he rallies. \u201cThen how\u2019s it your fault? You did your best. That\u2019s all anyone can ask of you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut, my best wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Grover mutters. \u201cI\u2019m a failure. A coward.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStop it, Grover,\u201d Percy says, frustrated. He places a hand on his shoulder and squeezes. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, you know that? You protected me for an entire year, and you\u2019re still protecting me now, even though I\u2019m dragging you straight into the Underworld\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, not straight into the Underworld. We\u2019ve taken a lot of detours at this point\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\u2014Hey, no, I\u2019m trying to comfort you here, dude. What was I saying?\u201d Percy pauses, thinking. Then he says, slow and deliberate, \u201cGrover, you\u2019re the bravest satyr I\u2019ve ever met. And even better, you\u2019re the kindest, too. You\u2019ve got a big heart. That\u2019s why you\u2019re going to be the one who finds Pan.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks, Percy,\u201d Grover smiles weakly. He pulls Percy forward and hugs him. Then he says, right in Percy\u2019s ear, \u201cBut, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the only satyr you\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShh,\u201d Percy whispers. \u201cWe\u2019re having a moment.\u201d\n\n\nGrover hugs him tighter.\n\n\n\nAw\n\n, says the zebra.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercy, Annabeth, and Grover make an entrance into Las Vegas with just as much fanfare as last time: by setting an albino lion, an antelope thing, and a much-too-talkative zebra on the general populace, Grover\u2019s blessing letting them safely weave through the groups of screaming people.\n\n\nToo bad it doesn\u2019t work on demigods.\n\n\nPercy doesn\u2019t really know where they should be going. But, the good thing about demigod traps is that Percy doesn\u2019t need to know where they are. They\u2019ll find him.\n\n\nAnnabeth leads them in ducking around tourists while Grover does his best not to look at the women with feather headdresses. Percy makes sure they leave a wide berth around every drunk person he spots. And, eventually, they do find themselves standing below a giant neon lotus, the Lotus Hotel and Casino sign glowing down at them.\n\n\nTarget acquired.\n\n\n\u201cPillows,\u201d Grover sighs dreamily.\n\n\n\u201cAnd showers,\u201d Annabeth adds.\n\n\nPercy grabs them both before they can leave the sidewalk.\n\n\n\u201cStay sharp,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this place.\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth raises her eyebrows.\n\n\n\u201cCome on, Percy,\u201d Grover bleats. He looks like he\u2019s two seconds away from stamping his hoof. \u201cI haven\u2019t slept on a bed in, like, a week! I\u2019m gonna have back issues before I hit forty!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI get it, dude. But we leave when I say we leave, okay?\u201d\n\n\nSomehow, the Lotus Hotel doesn\u2019t really hold the same appeal as it did before. Maybe it\u2019s because Percy\u2019s not actually twelve. Or maybe it\u2019s because he knows that the hotel is holding all these kids hostage in an unending time stasis and is slowly sucking their memories away.\n\n\nThe water slide around the elevator is still very tempting. Probably not in the way the Lotus Hotel wants it to be, though.\n\n\nPercy is very tempted. But, maybe later.\n\n\nHe has some things to get done first.\n\n\nAfter he, Annabeth, and Grover get washed up, Percy lets his friends go have their fun. He watches Annabeth beeline for the architectural design platform while Grover starts wandering towards the human-shooting game they found him at last time.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy heads to the shadows.\n\n\nNow. If he were a ten-year-old Mythomagic-obsessed son of Hades, where would he want to hang out?\n\n\nPercy finds Nico in a corner, sitting at what looks like a school lunch table and smirking at the nerd across from him, who\u2019s staring down at his cards, his head in his hands.\n\n\nAs Percy sneaks towards them, he sees the nerd finally slap his hands down and slide one of his cards forward. Nico scowls.\n\n\nWow. He looks a lot better with a tan. And without the trauma of having gone through Tartarus alone. Even with that familiar scowl on his face, he just looks like a normal little kid.\n\n\nNo. Right now he is just a normal little kid.\n\n\n\u201cAres?\u201d Percy says, leaning over Nico\u2019s bent head. His hand is hovering over a card featuring the image of a guy who looks nothing like that asshole on the motorcycle. \u201cNo offense, but he\u2019s a huge jerk. Why don\u2019t you play, um, Dionysus instead?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Nico mutters. \u201cDionysus is the weakest god card, even if his powers are totally sweet. I\u2019ll need Ares\u2019s blood rage, so he can tank for the next three rounds.\u201d Then he pauses, before twisting his head around like a baby owl. \u201cOh!\u201d he cries, voice suddenly an octave higher. \u201cHello!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nNico blinks up at Percy and grins. \u201cDo you wanna play too?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUh\u2014\u201d Percy blanks for a minute, trying to remember the last time he saw Nico smile at him like that. It\u2019s been so long that he actually can\u2019t recall. \u201cNah. I\u2019m still just learning about Mythomagic.\u201d\n\n\nNico gasps. \u201cThen you should definitely play! Here,\u201d he scoots over, patting the six inches of bench next to him enthusiastically. \u201cSit with me. We can be a team!\u201d\n\n\nPercy hesitates. Sitting still and playing cards isn\u2019t exactly his thing. But it\u2019s Nico, so he nods and says, \u201cAlright.\u201d\n\n\nSquished up against Nico at the lunch table, Percy does his best to pay attention as Nico babbles about the rules, and he\u2019s so cheerful that he\u2019s pretty much unrecognizable. While Nico thrashes the other nerd to the tune of his own running commentary, Percy alternates between holding back snorts at the wildly inaccurate pictures of the gods and glancing at Nico\u2019s happy little face. Occasionally, he also hums in agreement with whatever Nico\u2019s saying. At that, Nico always brightens up even more.\n\n\nHoly Hades. Was Nico always like this before Percy and the Fates fucked his life up?\n\n\n\u201cNico!\u201d Someone scolds from behind them, and Percy flinches, reaching for his sword.\n\n\nFortunately, he reignites his brain in time to not make a truly horrible impression on Bianca, who continues, \u201cWhat are you still doing here? It\u2019s way past your bedtime.\u201d\n\n\nShe reaches for Nico\u2019s Mythomagic deck, and he slaps her hands away.\n\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d he yelps. \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing me in front of my friend!\u201d He gives Percy a quick glance, then looks away just as fast. \u201cGeez, Bianca, you\u2019re such a killjoy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNico\u2014\u201d Bianca puffs up, her face tight with anger, before deflating. She turns to Percy and says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about my brother. He wasn\u2019t bothering you, was he?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Percy says. He thinks he sounds pretty calm for a guy talking to the first person he got killed. He\u2019s still shaky on the inside though, which is why he immediately goes, \u201cUh, hey, quick question. When\u2019s your birthday?\u201d\n\n\nBianca\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cWhy are you asking?\u201d she says, as she tries to tug Nico away from the lunch table.\n\n\n\u201cUm. I\u2019m doing a survey. For\u2014a school project.\u201d\n\n\nBianca doesn\u2019t seem less suspicious of Percy, but she probably also doesn\u2019t see the harm in giving a random kid her birthday, so she says, slowly, \u201cOctober 27th.\u201d\n\n\nPercy lets out a breath he didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d been holding.\n\n\nThank all the gods.\u00a0\n\n\nUh.\u00a0\n\n\nOn second thought, just thank Hades.\n\n\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Percy says, standing with Nico, who Bianca then covertly shuffles behind her. \u201cGood. That\u2019s good.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nA pause, as Percy tries to figure out what to say to the di Angelos, ignorant and innocent, their fates quivering like two birds huddled together on an icy wire.\n\n\nThen he gives up.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Percy. I\u2014Uh, I know your dad.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBianca freezes. Nico gapes.\n\n\nPercy says, \u201cHe sent me here to take you home.\u201d\n\n\nToo bad convincing the di Angelos to leave with him isn\u2019t that easy.\n\n\nWell, convincing Bianca isn\u2019t that easy.\n\n\n\u201cOur dad is dead.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not, actually,\u201d Percy says. He\u2019s walking backwards towards the elevator, Nico trailing him like a duckling and Bianca following Nico. \u201cHe\u2019s just really good at playing dead. You guys were in a lot of danger, so your dad had to\u2014uh, lay low for a while. He faked his own death,\u201d he adds, getting a sudden spark of inspiration.\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Nico says. He considers that statement for a moment, then concludes, \u201cThat\u2019s \n\nepic\n\n.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe\u2019s practically bouncing. Percy suddenly understands a lot better why it took so long for them to figure out he was a child of Hades.\n\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s safe now?\u201d Bianca asks. Even she\u2019s softening in the face of Nico\u2019s enthusiasm.\n\n\nPercy hesitates. \u201cUm. Basically.\u201d\n\n\nBianca does not look convinced. But Nico\u2019s pretty much vibrating at this point. Percy\u2019s afraid that if he gets any more excited, he\u2019ll pop a baby skeleton out of the middle of the lobby.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. This is so cool! Can we go see Dad now? Is\u2014\u201d Nico glances at Bianca, then down at the floor, then back at Percy. \u201cWill our mom be there too?\u201d he asks, slightly more quietly.\n\n\nAh, shit. Why is Percy always telling this kid that his family\u2019s dead?\n\n\nPanicking just a little, Percy looks at Bianca, and his eyes must seem crazy enough because she takes the cue to hold Nico closer.\n\n\n\u201cNico,\u201d Percy starts, \u201cyour mom\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe trails off. What can he say? Sorry, kids, your uncle killed your mom because she was your mom, and he didn\u2019t like that. Also, your dad is literally Hades, the god of the Underworld, and by the way, you\u2019ve been stuck in a hotel playing games for seventy years.\n\n\nNico\u2019s already wilting. Percy feels like he\u2019s kicked a three-headed puppy.\n\n\nLuckily, Bianca\u2019s supernatural power of interfering just when Percy\u2019s about to screw Nico up for life kicks in, and she bends down, telling Nico, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We still have Dad, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Nico says, bouncing back immediately. Then he pauses, eyebrows furrowed.\n\n\n\u201cBut if our dad is alive,\u201d he pieces together slowly, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t he come get us himself?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nPercy\u2019s back hits the elevator frame.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, Percy,\u201d Bianca adds, eyeing him like he just drove up in a white van and asked her brother if he\u2019d like some candy. \u201cWhy send you?\u201d\n\n\nGood question.\u00a0\n\n\nWhy did the di Angelos have to be so sharp?\n\n\nPercy sighs. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says, jabbing at the elevator button, \u201csometimes parents make really bad decisions, and the rest of us just have to roll with it.\u201d\n\n\nBianca looks unmoved, but Nico just nods like Percy\u2019s just dropped the wisest advice he\u2019s ever heard.\n\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Percy glances at Nico, then redirects his gaze to Bianca. \u201cDo you wanna go or not?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercy does not blow up the Lotus Hotel via their waterslide. He feels like that would leave a bad impression on Bianca, who barely trusts him already.\n\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he really, really wants to.\n\n\nAfter Percy collects Annabeth and Grover and Ares\u2019s stupid cursed backpack, he drags all four of his friends out into the dubiously fresh air of Las Vegas, resolutely not looking at the water slide the entire time.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Nico says, staring wide-eyed at the speeding cars and neon lights.\n\n\n\u201cThis seems...different,\u201d Bianca agrees.\n\n\n\u201cOh, you know Vegas,\u201d Percy says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a different city every day.\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth finally shakes off her design daze and notices that they\u2019ve managed to exit the Lotus hotel with more people than they started with.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPercy,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cWhy do you have two random kids with you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not random kids.\u201d Percy gestures at Nico and Bianca, who are too distracted by a passing limo to pay attention. \u201cThis is Bianca and Nico di Angelo.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNice to meet you guys,\u201d Grover calls over. Then he hooks one arm over Percy\u2019s shoulders and hisses, \u201cPercy, why do you have two random kids with you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re my emotional support random kids.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPercy.\u201d Annabeth does not sound amused.\n\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Percy says, \u201ctheir dad lives in LA. So I thought\u2014\u201d\n\n\nGrover throws his hands up in the air. \u201c\n\nDi immortales\n\n, Percy. We can\u2019t help out every lost kid we bump into.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut we helped the zebra! And the lion and the antelope thing!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat was different!\u201d Grover insists. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t just leave them in that truck!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd I can\u2019t just leave Nico and Bianca here!\u201d Percy realizes that he\u2019s raising his voice. He doesn\u2019t want to yell at his friends. \u201cPlease, guys,\u201d he says more quietly. \u201cJust think of this as another side quest.\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth folds her arms. Grover looks nervous.\n\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Percy begs. \u201cJust look at them. Look at Nico\u2019s face.\u201d Percy walks over to the di Angelos and frames Nico\u2019s cheeks with his hands. Nico probably doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, but he plays along, widening his eyes and sticking out his lower lip.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCan you really say no to this face?\u201d Percy asks.\n\n\nA moment of silence.\n\n\nThen Grover visibly crumples. He elbows Annabeth, who sighs heavily.\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you\u2019re in charge of babysitting.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks, guys,\u201d Percy says, while Nico protests, \u201cHey! I\u2019m not a baby.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAt least I won\u2019t be the only girl on this trip anymore,\u201d Annabeth adds, eyeing Bianca appreciatively. Bianca gives her a small smile. Annabeth slowly smiles back.\u00a0\n\n\nFor a second, they just look at each other.\u00a0\n\n\nThen Annabeth sweeps forward, and they start walking out of the alleyway together, Annabeth introducing Bianca to Las Vegas\u2019s architectural styles as they go.\n\n\nPercy blinks.\n\n\nUh.\n\n\nWhat just happened?\n\n\nBianca is pulling Nico along with her, ignoring how he turns around to glance at Percy after every three steps they take, so it\u2019s just him and Grover left in front of the glowing lotus symbol.\n\n\nBefore Percy can follow the girls out, Grover catches him by the arm. \u201cPercy,\u201d he whispers, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know what you\u2019re doing, but those two kids\u2014They\u2019re kind of\u2014And they smell\u2014\u201c\n\n\n\u201cCut \u2019em some slack.\u201d Percy reverses his grip so that he can tug Grover forward. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been outside in seventy years.\u201d Then he turns his head, noticing Grover\u2019s worried look.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d Percy says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. Just trust me,\u201d he adds.\n\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Grover mutters under his breath. \u201cI think that\u2019s the problem.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Nico repeats. He hasn\u2019t said anything else since they left the taxi that delivered them to LA while packed like a can of sardines. Grover had called shotgun. Annabeth and Bianca seemed happy enough chatting about Las Vegas\u2019s interpretation of iconic Venecian architecture. Percy has gotten to know Nico\u2019s Mythomagic deck really well, possibly through osmosis, since Nico had been practically in his lap the entire car ride.\n\n\nBianca seems less excited and more overwhelmed. \u201cIt\u2019s very...advanced,\u201d she says. Then she turns to look at Percy, like she knows there\u2019s something he\u2019s not telling them.\n\n\n\u201cYou should see New York,\u201d Percy quickly replies. \u201cIt\u2019s a thousand times better organized. Right, Annabeth?\u201d he adds, slipping to the side so that she\u2019s blocking Bianca\u2019s eyes from his.\n\n\nAs Annabeth draws Bianca into a discussion of city planning, Percy leads everyone to a Payless Shoesource by telling Grover that he can\u2019t go around LA in blood-splattered shoes.\n\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s your blood,\u201d Grover points out.\n\n\n\u201cHow does that make it better?\u201d Percy asks. \u201cPeople are still going to think we\u2019re, like, little gangbangers. They might even try to pick a fight.\u201d\n\n\nGrover glances around nervously.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a bottomless LotusCash card,\u201d Percy cajoles. \u201cWe might as well use it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Annabeth agrees. She\u2019s looking down at Bianca\u2019s shoes, which are some sort of strappy leather contraption with a small heel. \u201cI\u2019d like a pair of fresh sneakers if we\u2019re going to be walking around the city all day.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Grover sighs, \u201cbut I\u2019m not explaining to Luke why there\u2019s blood all over his shoes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Percy will scrub the blood off with his toothbrush. Right, Percy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy does it have to be my \n\ntoothbrush\n\n\u2014\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth, Bianca, and Nico, who\u2019s staring at a pair of light-up shoes like they\u2019re newly released Mythomagic figurines, quickly disappear into the stacks of shoe shelves. Percy lingers on the welcoming mat, getting dirty looks from the cashier as he tries to remember how they got into the Underworld last time around.\u00a0\n\n\nThey gave Cerberus a red ball, and they had to bribe Charon, but where did they get the drachmas to bribe Charon with\u2026?\n\n\nHuh. Didn\u2019t they run into that dinosaur yoga enthusiast guy here? What was his name, something something with an \u201cee\u201d sound\u2014\n\n\nAn orange shoebox is shoved under Percy\u2019s nose. \u201cHey, what do you think about\u2014What is it?\u201d Grover asks.\n\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Percy says. \u201cActually, I think I saw a Burger King around that corner. I\u2019m gonna go buy us some food.\u201d\n\n\nGrover hesitates, eyes flickering across Percy\u2019s face. Then he nods. \u201cAsk them if they serve their coke in a can,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\u201cWill do!\u201d Percy waves and leaves to the toll of the bell on the door.\n\n\nLos Angeles may be a big, loud, smelly cesspool of bums and street hawkers, but Percy\u2019s worse than all of them and has the glare to prove it. No one dares to approach him as he jogs down the street, so he gets to Crusty\u2019s Water Bed Palace pretty quickly. The only time he has to stop is when he passes an appliance store and spots Smelly Gabe talking to Barbara Walters on one of the TVs.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy would like to say that he\u2019d forgotten Smelly Gabe had even existed, but that\u2019s a lie. He just can\u2019t think about him for too long without wanting to turn the nearest water pipe into a geyser.\n\n\nCrusty\u2019s store is just as neon and dyslexia-unfriendly as Percy barely remembers. As he enters, he pulls Riptide from his pocket.\n\n\n\u201cHello!\u201d says Crusty, slowly ambling over with a cold, reptilian smile. He extends a hand for Percy to shake. \u201cI\u2019m Crusty\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Percy says.\n\n\nCrusty makes a choking noise, hand halfway raised. His eyes bug out of his raptor-like head. But it\u2019s probably not because he\u2019s outraged over the quip.\n\n\nAfter all, there is currently a sword sticking out of his gut.\n\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s just rude,\u201d Crusty says, right before Percy rips Riptide up and out, not-so-neatly splitting him from belly to throat.\n\n\nAs Crusty plunges forward, giant hands extended towards Percy\u2019s throat, Percy ducks in close, close enough that his instincts are screaming at him in protest, and angles his blade towards Crusty\u2019s jugular.\u00a0\n\n\nGolden sand sprays across the floor, nicely accenting a tropical-themed display bed.\n\n\nPercy breathes out.\u00a0\n\n\nThen he curses and slaps his thigh with the flat of his sword.\n\n\nThat was way messier than it should have been. Crusty had been surprised and off guard, and that\u2019s the only reason why Percy was able to take him on his own. Even then, he screwed up the first blow. He\u2019s still overestimating his reach. He either needs to spend a week training before they go to the Underworld, or he needs to grow at least eight inches right now.\n\n\nWait a minute.\n\n\nPercy looks at the nearest water bed.\n\n\nThen he hears a gasp.\n\n\nWhirling around, Percy points Riptide at the source of the noise.\n\n\nNico is holding the door half open, his eyes like little moons in his pale face.\n\n\nPercy\u2019s hand shakes.\u00a0\n\n\nHe immediately backs away, capping Riptide and returning it to his pocket. Holding his hands up, Percy approaches Nico like he\u2019s a wild hellhound.\n\n\n\u201cNico,\u201d Percy says. \u201cI can explain.\u201d\n\n\nNico doesn\u2019t move. He blinks once, twice.\n\n\nThen he steps into Crusty\u2019s store, letting the door slam shut behind himself.\u00a0\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look like Nico\u2019s about to run away screaming. Percy slowly puts his hands down.\n\n\nNico stares up into Percy\u2019s eyes, his expression unreadable. For a moment, Percy sees the Nico from three years and never into the future, a ghost looking at him from his sunlit balcony, and he has to blink away the visions of another person who he will never let exist.\n\n\nThen Nico starts smiling, his face open and full of wonder.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAre you a god?\u201d he asks softly.\n\n\nPercy freezes.\n\n\nCrap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPoseidon? He has 3000 attack points and infinite health in a water arena! And he\u2019s your dad?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nNico is sitting on Crusty\u2019s office desk and kicking an excited drumbeat into the side with his heels while Percy frisks the drawers for cash and drachmas and anything that looks useful but not cursed, which is nothing.\n\n\n\u201cPretty much,\u201d Percy answers. Crusty\u2019s business cards are worse than his store sign. Percy can feel the headache coming on.\n\n\n\u201cSo\u2014\u201d Nico lets his legs dangle. \u201cAre Bianca and I...?\u201d\n\n\nPercy weighs the pros and cons of lying versus not lying, before deciding that maybe he should tell Hades\u2019s kid that he\u2019s Hades\u2019s kid before dragging him and his sister into the Underworld.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYup, demigods, the both of you,\u201d Percy nods.\n\n\nNico looks at Percy like he just handed him seventy years worth of birthday presents all at once.\n\n\n\u201cThat is \n\nso cool,\u201d\n\n he says, voice giddy. \u201cDoes that mean I can have a sword like yours? Do I get to kill monsters too? Will you teach me how to kill monsters?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUh, ask your sister.\u201d Come to think of it, Bianca\u2019s probably freaking out about her missing brother right now. Percy better get Nico back before she accidentally summons a skeleton army in the middle of a Payless Shoesource.\n\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Nico says. After Percy spotted a couple of kids eyeing him like they were trying to figure out how much his jacket sells for, he told Nico to walk a bit closer, so Nico\u2019s basically trotting under his arm right now. \u201cIf you\u2019re the son of Poseidon, does that mean\u2014I mean, you\u2019re not our brother, are you?\u201d\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t seem very excited about the possibility.\n\n\nJust when Percy\u2019s about to ask if he\u2019s too lame to be a di Angelo, he sees that Nico\u2019s staring intensely at the dirty, gum-scarred street. And his cheeks are a little red.\n\n\nPercy is suddenly very aware that Nico is the second person he managed to get dumped by without ever dating.\n\n\nThe thing is that Percy doesn\u2019t know when Nico started crushing on him originally. He\u2019s pretty sure that after he first met Nico, he just ignored him for a week. And then he got Bianca killed.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter that, Nico was pretty set on hating him for the rest of his life, and Percy honestly couldn\u2019t blame him. Still can\u2019t, actually.\n\n\nBut even if Percy doesn\u2019t understand how it happened last time, he still has to try his best to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. It\u2019s better if Nico doesn\u2019t get too attached to him. Loving Percy has never been an easy job, and it\u2019s only going to get worse.\u00a0\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to screw up a perfectly good ten-year-old Mythomagic nerd. Again.\n\n\nSo, Percy says, \u201cNo.\u201d And before Nico\u2019s face can completely light up, he continues, \u201cTechnically, I\u2019m your cousin. Kind of, I guess.\u201d Percy can see Nico\u2019s hopes and dreams dying in real time, so he quickly adds, \u201cYour dad is Hades, lord of the\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHades?\u201d Nico immediately perks back up. \u201cGod of the Underworld Hades?\u201d\n\n\nOkay, that\u2019s too much enthusiasm for a hellish mom-napper who once (will?) put Percy in a tiny cell while he was trying to save all of Olympus. \u201cYeah,\u201d Percy starts, \u201cbut Nico\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Nico shrieks. He\u2019s clutching at Percy\u2019s shirt with his little baby claws. \u201cHades is my dad?\u201d he breathes. \u201cHades is my dad! He has 5000 attack points if the opponent attacks first! This is the best day of my entire \n\nlife!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that Nico knows who his godly parent is, Percy knows he has to tell Bianca, too. Hopefully he can introduce her to the world of demigods in a way that\u2019s less traumatizing than having her watch him kill someone with a sword or see someone she loves be choked out by the Minotaur or something.\n\n\nBut, it turns out that Percy didn\u2019t really need to have anything planned, because as soon as they get within ten feet of where Bianca, Annabeth, and Grover are waiting outside the Payless, Nico runs ahead, calling, \u201cBianca! Bianca! Guess what? Hades is our dad! We\u2019re both demigods!\u201d\n\n\nPercy doesn\u2019t smack himself in the forehead, but it\u2019s a near thing.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d says Bianca.\n\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d says Annabeth.\n\n\nAnnabeth whips her head around to look at Grover for confirmation, but Grover is too busy glancing between Nico\u2019s grin and Bianca\u2019s confused expression. Horror slowly dawns on his face.\n\n\n\u201cPercy\u2026\u201d he whispers. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can explain,\u201d Percy says, before realizing that he actually can\u2019t explain. \u201cUh,\u201d he says intelligently. \u201cI had a gut feeling?\u201d\n\n\nGrover groans, burying his face in his hands.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d Annabeth mutters. \u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2014\u201d She catches Bianca\u2019s eye, but quickly flinches away. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAnnabeth stares down at the sidewalk, her hands clenching and unclenching. For a moment, she\u2019s as stony as Medusa\u2019s statues.\n\n\nAnd then she turns around and storms off.\n\n\nFuck.\n\n\nBianca\u2019s gaze follows Annabeth until she disappears around the corner of the block. Then she looks at Percy.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPercy wonders if he looked that confused and hollowed out when he learned who his dad was.\n\n\nBut every second that passes is a second that Annabeth spends getting further from them and closer to getting mugged, so Percy can\u2019t stay to explain\u2014Also, frankly, he doesn\u2019t want to\u2014so he just says, \u201cGrover, could you tell them\u2014um, everything? Please? I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDude\u2014\u201d\n\n\nPercy\u2019s already running.\n\n\n\u201cAnnabeth,\u201d he calls. \u201cAnnabeth. Please, Annabeth, it\u2019s not what you think\u2014\u201d\n\n\nHe reaches for her hand, but she wrenches it away before he can even touch her.\n\n\nInstead, she shoves him into the nearest alley and uses her forearm to pin his neck to the grimy brick wall.\n\n\n\u201cAnd what am I supposed to think, Percy?\u201d she hisses. \u201cWe\u2019re travelling to the Underworld, trying to find the Master Bolt, which Hades stole, and you just happen to show up with two of his kids? How do I know that you aren\u2019t trying to\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing this for Hades,\u201d Percy says. \u201cI\u2019m doing this for Nico and Bianca. They don\u2019t deserve to be stuck in the Lotus Hotel forever\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDeserve?\u201d Annabeth snorts. \u201cThey don\u2019t deserve anything. They shouldn\u2019t even be here\u2014They shouldn\u2019t be alive! I just can\u2019t believe\u2014After everything\u2014After everything Hades did, it turns out that he broke the oath, too! Then why\u2014Why was Thalia the one who\u2026?\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth backs away, pressing her eyes into the crook of her elbow.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy doesn\u2019t move.\n\n\nHe wants to defend Nico and Bianca. He wants to tell Annabeth that Hades didn\u2019t break the oath, that Nico and Bianca have been hidden away for decades like pieces of a broken china set that Hades can no longer bear to look at.\u00a0\n\n\nBut that wouldn\u2019t be helpful right now.\n\n\nSo Percy just says, \u201cThey didn\u2019t ask to be born.\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth shifts her arm to glare at him, but she also doesn\u2019t lunge at him again, so Percy quietly continues, \u201cHades was cruel and unfair, sending monsters after Thalia. And Zeus should have protected her, but he didn\u2019t. And none of the Big Three should have broken the oath, so I shouldn\u2019t have lived at all. But, I did, and they did. They did.\u201d Percy takes a breath, digging his fingernails into the brick.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not Nico and Bianca\u2019s fault,\u201d he points out. \u201cThey\u2019re just kids. Like Thalia was. They don\u2019t know anything. They haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re just gonna hand them over to Hades, so he can train them to\u2014\n\ndo something,\u201d\n\n Annabeth sneers.\n\n\nPercy takes another breath. Then another.\n\n\nHe lets that sit there for a minute while Annabeth stews.\n\n\nThen he says, as calmly as he can, \u201cHades has my mom, Annabeth.\u201d\n\n\nHer eyes snap back to his.\n\n\n\u201cMy mom\u2014\u201d Percy shakes his head, trying to put his thoughts together. \u201cHades took her. He\u2019s holding her hostage, and\u2014I\u2019m the reason he\u2019s doing this. She shouldn\u2019t be in the Underworld! I want\u2014I need her to be okay. That\u2019s why I\u2019m bringing him the di Angelos. I\u2019m going to take her back using everything I can.\u201d\n\n\nPercy looks up at Annabeth\u2019s cold face. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you do the same,\u201d he says slowly, \u201dif Thalia was stuck down there and not in a stupid pine tree?\u201d\n\n\nA long silence, disturbed only by the beeping of cars and the mutters of passersby.\n\n\nAnnabeth\u2019s gaze is drilling into Percy the entire time.\n\n\nFinally, she turns her head away, towards the mouth of the alley. In the slanting sunlight, Percy can see her lips trembling.\n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Annabeth mutters. \u201cBut you better keep them away from me.\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth refuses to sit with them on the bus to Santa Monica Bay. She leans on a pole near the front door, quietly interrogating the confused bus driver about the DOA Recording Studios flyer Percy scavenged from Crusty\u2019s office.\n\n\nBianca stares at her from the back of the bus until she notices Percy noticing. Then she turns her gaze to the window.\u00a0\n\n\nSitting in the row in front of them, Nico asks Grover rapid-fire questions about all the monsters he\u2019s encountered, Grover looking more and more terrified as time goes on. Whether it\u2019s because of the memories or because of the hyperactive son of Hades bouncing in the seat next to him, Percy doesn\u2019t know.\n\n\nSo, now\u2019s as good a time as any to talk to Bianca. To be honest, he\u2019s surprised she\u2019s stuck around this long already.\u00a0\n\n\nOkay, if it wasn\u2019t for Annabeth, she probably would\u2019ve decked him and ran off before they made it on the bus.\n\n\nPercy shifts uncomfortably. It was stupid of him not to think about how Annabeth would react to a child of Hades before Thalia got un-tree-ed. And now Bianca is suffering for it.\n\n\nStupid.\n\n\nPercy slips into the one seat gap between him and Bianca. She doesn\u2019t move her head, but she\u2019s watching him from the corner of her eye.\n\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Percy says, \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you everything about why I took you and Nico out of the Lotus Hotel.\u201d\n\n\nBianca gives him a small smile that quickly fades away. \u201cI kind of figured. The whole demigod thing was a bit of a giveaway.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot just that.\u201d\n\n\nBianca finally turns her head away from the window. Percy can\u2019t meet her eyes, so he stares down at his hands instead. He still gets a shock when he sees them.\u00a0\n\n\nSo small. So weak.\n\n\nPercy starts, \u201cI needed you guys\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThen he goes silent.\n\n\nWill the bus driver still take them to Santa Monica if Bianca gets his blood on the seats? No, wait, that should be the least of his worries.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI needed you because your dad kidnapped my mom, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gonna give her back without a fight,\u201d Percy says, as quickly as he can. \u201cOr a trade,\u201d he adds more quietly.\n\n\nBianca doesn\u2019t say anything for a long time.\n\n\nThen she whispers, \u201cSo we\u2019re your hostages.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Percy yelps. He pauses to think about it. \u201cMaybe a little,\u201d he amends.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy looks up. Bianca has turned back to the window. Her chin is wobbling. Or maybe that\u2019s just the bus.\n\n\nLast time, Percy didn\u2019t know Bianca for long. Didn\u2019t know her at all, really. To him, she has always been a ghost and a martyr and the first person who took a death that should have been his own.\n\n\nIt\u2019s strange, now, to be talking to the girl who wanted to be free so badly that she threw away her brother.\n\n\nIt hurts to be the one who\u2019s not even giving her a choice this time.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bianca.\u201d\n\n\nPercy goes to give her some room, but her hand lashes out and grabs him by the wrist before he can move.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d Bianca takes a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay. But I get it, I guess.\u201d After a second, she adds, \u201cYou must really love your mother, huh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the best,\u201d Percy says, digging his fingernails into his leg. \u201cAnd Hades took her because of me, so I have to get her back.\u201d\n\n\nBianca sits quietly for a moment. Then she glances at Percy and says, \u201cI don\u2019t remember my mom at all.\u201d\n\n\nPercy wants to drain the Lethe and use the water to strangle Hades. \u201cShe loved you,\u201d he says fiercely. \u201cSo much. She would\u2019ve given up everything to make you and Nico happy. She refused to hide in the Underworld because she wanted to raise you close to her family.\u201d\n\n\nBianca stares. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\n\n\nCrap.\n\n\nShould he lie?\u00a0\n\n\nPercy pinches himself in the thigh. He\u2019s already done too much lying to the di Angelos. Worst comes to worst, one of them will just hold a grudge against him forever. And he\u2019s used to that.\n\n\n\u201cI dreamed about it,\u201d Percy tells Bianca. \u201cIt\u2019s a demigod thing,\u201d he adds quickly. \u201cProphetic dreams, visions of the past\u2014You\u2019ll probably get them, too, at some point.\u201d\n\n\nBianca nods, looking dazed. She lets go of his wrist, but Percy doesn\u2019t try moving away again.\n\n\nHe can tell that she\u2019s thinking. She\u2019ll have more questions she wants answered. And Percy wants to try to answer them, because he knows how frustrating it is to be shoved into a strange new world where no one will give you a straight answer about anything, especially the things that will kill the people you love.\n\n\nPercy does regret it, though, when Bianca looks at him through her hair and says, \u201c...Does our dad even want us?\u201d\n\n\nIt would be the easiest thing in the world to just grin and say, \u201cOf course he does!\u201d Percy would say that, if he was sure that it was true. But he doesn\u2019t, so he can\u2019t, and he won\u2019t.\n\n\nHonestly, taking the di Angelos to Hades is a gamble. By washing their memories clean and putting them in the Lotus Hotel, Hades was protecting them, but he also did it to protect himself from the pain of seeing their mother in their faces. Percy had noticed a long time ago that Nico has Maria di Angelo\u2019s smile, but now he can also see that Bianca has her eyes.\u00a0\n\n\nThere\u2019s a chance that Hades won\u2019t even let them into his palace. That he won\u2019t even look at them.\n\n\nBut, Percy thinks there\u2019s also a good chance that Hades won\u2019t do that. He remembers the glimpses he got of Nico growing up, Nico growing into the empty spaces at his father\u2019s side. Of all the Greek gods, Hades might be the one who understands the happiness and sorrow of making a family best.\n\n\nPercy isn\u2019t going to make excuses for the jerk who kidnapped his mom, though, so he just tells Bianca, \u201cHe loves you two. A lot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen why did he abandon us?\u201d Bianca says.\n\n\n\u201cBeing a child of the Big Three\u2014Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades\u2014It\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Percy explains. \u201cWe\u2019re dangerous. And...most people don\u2019t really like Hades, so it\u2019s even more dangerous to be his kid. He probably thought he was protecting you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about him. Except that he\u2019s an abductor of moms, apparently.\u201d Bianca\u2019s lip curls.\n\n\nDang. Is Percy going to have to make excuses for the jerk who kidnapped his mom? Is this what his life has come to?\n\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Percy says, \u201cHades is\u2014He\u2019s bitter. And he hates a lot of people. Like me. But underneath all the frowning and death threats and creepy robes with people\u2019s souls sewn into them, he\u2019s just a guy who cares about his family so much that he\u2019ll curse the Oracle of Delphi to forever be an undead zombie mummy.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBianca looks horrified.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cUh,\u201d Percy stumbles. \u201cActually, forget that. Sorry, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going with this.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nSeaweed Brain. You are such an idiot sometimes.\n\n\n\nPercy breathes in.\n\n\nHe says, \u201cI think you\u2019ll learn to love your dad, if you stick with him. And if it really doesn\u2019t work out, you can leave. You can come to New York and find me, and I\u2019ll help you. I mean, you could even run away and join the Hunters of Artemis if you wanted to. Just\u2014You\u2019re in charge of your own life, Bianca.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nPercy hesitates. Then he takes Crusty\u2019s wallet out of his backpack and hands it to her.\u00a0\n\n\nAs she reaches out, he says, \u201cIf you really don\u2019t want to see Hades, then take a train and go. I\u2019ll work something out. You go do whatever you want to do.\u201d\n\n\nBianca takes the wallet, worrying the hopefully-not human leather under her thumb.\n\n\n\u201cWhat if I want to rob a bank?\u201d she asks. \u201cOr kick puppies?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Percy says confidently. \u201cYou won\u2019t. You\u2019re a good person.\u201d\n\n\nBianca doesn\u2019t respond.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe me?\u201d Percy says.\n\n\nBianca sighs. \u201cI already believe that my dad isn\u2019t dead because he\u2019s actually the Ancient Greek god of the Underworld. I might as well believe you about this, too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercy walks into the Santa Monica Bay to the tune of Nico\u2019s excited chatter. A mako shark presses its snout into his palm, and he pets its back a couple times before grabbing onto its dorsal fin.\n\n\nWhile Percy waits for the Nereid to show up, he looks down into the impenetrable black of the ocean proper. It\u2019s not tempting in the same way it was when he was twelve the first time and wanted to see his dad\u2019s court. It\u2019s not even tempting in the way that the call of the ocean outside Camp Jupiter was tempting, back when Percy had nothing but Annabeth\u2019s name.\u00a0\n\n\nStill. There\u2019s one part of Percy that just wants to sink into the darkness, into the sands below his father\u2019s palace, so far down that even the gods are out of reach.\n\n\nA glowing hand tilts his chin back up.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve come very far, Percy,\u201d says the Nereid. \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUh, thanks,\u201d Percy says. She really does look like his mom. It makes it hard to stare at her for too long. To cut the exchange short, Percy just goes ahead and asks, \u201cDo you have something for me? From my father?\u201d\n\n\nThe Nereid pauses. Then she says, \u201cYes. It\u2019s an unhappy thing, that the gods can work only through indirect influence. But your father would not have you die before your time. That is why I\u2019ve come to give you a gift and a warning.\u201d\n\n\nShe opens her right hand. There are three pearls sitting in her palm.\n\n\n\u201cI know you journey to Hades\u2019s realm. Once you are there, he will never willingly let you leave. Therefore, when you are in need, smash one pearl at your feet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Percy says. He fidgets with the hem of his shirt, steels himself, and then looks up into her eyes. \u201cBut, do you happen to have any more pearls with you? I know a couple of kids who might also be \u2018in need\u2019 of a way out of the Underworld.\u201d\n\n\nThe Nereid raises an eyebrow. \u201cOh?\u201d she says.\n\n\nAnd so Percy lets the whole sad story of the di Angelos pour out. Maria, Hades, Zeus. The Underworld, the Lethe, the Lotus Hotel. Nico and Bianca, trapped between worlds.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce Percy finishes, he\u2019s staring into the ocean again, and there\u2019s nothing but silence. When he peeks up at the Nereid\u2019s face, her expression is smooth and unreadable, like the surface of a stillwater pond.\n\n\nPercy can suddenly hear the blood rushing through his head, rolling faster and faster.\n\n\nDid he just put Nico and Bianca in even more danger?\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Percy says quickly, \u201cjust forget it. And\u2014and I don\u2019t want to get you in trouble with Lord Poseidon or anything, but if you could forget everything I just said about the di Angelos, that would be great\u2014\u201c\n\n\nThe Nereid holds up one hand.\n\n\n\u201cPeace, Percy,\u201d she says. \u201cI will not withhold my assistance from a child in need.\u201d\n\n\nShe closes her first. When she unfolds her fingers again, there are five pearls sitting in her palm.\n\n\nThe Nereid gently takes Percy\u2019s wrist, and then she pours the pearls into his hand.\n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Percy says, holding the pearls to his chest. \u201cThank you so, so much.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe Nereid smiles and starts floating back to her seahorse.\n\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d Percy calls.\n\n\nShe turns.\n\n\n\u201cUh,\u201d Percy says. \u201cWhat do you want in return?\u201d\n\n\nThe Nereid gives him a weird look. \u201cNothing,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Percy\u2019s brain stutters. \u201cBut, there\u2019s always a price. There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. Isn\u2019t that an Ancient Greek saying?\u201d\n\n\nFor a moment, the Nereid just looks at him.\u00a0\n\n\nThen her lips curl upwards, even as the rest of her expression crumples.\n\n\n\u201cOh, Percy,\u201d she says. \u201cA little bit of compassion will not cost me a thing. And it won\u2019t cost you either. You must go with what your heart tells you. I hope you remember that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Percy makes it back on land, Bianca is still there. And even though Annabeth still won\u2019t talk or even look at her, she continues not running for the nearest train station during the whole time they spend travelling to DOA Recording Studios.\n\n\nWhich is good, because descending into the Underworld is laughably easy with her and Nico there. It\u2019s kind of freaking Percy out. He\u2019s pretty sure nothing in his life has ever gone this swimmingly.\n\n\nAs soon as Charon spots Nico at Percy\u2019s side and Bianca over his shoulder, he immediately escorts them back to the elevator. Despite Bianca\u2019s protests, he then proceeds to boot out all of the waiting souls, so a bunch of demigods and a satyr are suddenly getting a private ride across the River Styx.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch that,\u201d Bianca hisses.\n\n\nNico withdraws his hand from a plastic toy floating on top of the dark, oily river. He shoots Bianca a guilty look.\n\n\nCharon starts poling faster.\n\n\nCerberus is nothing but an overgrown puppy in front of the di Angelos. His three heads push against one another, each one trying to spend more time under Nico\u2019s frantically patting hands. Though Cerberus is way too tall for Nico to give him a proper head rub, Nico still pets the front of his snouts with the serious face that Percy has only seen him show his Mythomagic deck so far.\n\n\nBianca looks on, shifting from foot to foot, like she wants to join in but isn\u2019t sure how.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy\u2019s about to give her a push forward when Annabeth unzips her backpack, takes out a bright red Waterland dodgeball, and shoves it in front of Bianca\u2019s face.\n\n\nBianca blinks, surprised. Then she smiles and says, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\nAnnabeth still won\u2019t look at her.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the di Angelos don\u2019t even make it through their third round of fetch before the sound of swooping wings sends the surrounding spirits screaming and scattering out of line.\n\n\nAs Mrs. Dodds and her sisters land, Percy pushes in front of Grover and Annabeth, who draws her knife. Bianca tugs Nico closer.\u00a0\n\n\nBut the Furies don\u2019t attack.\n\n\n\u201cChildren,\u201d says Mrs. Dodds. Even though Percy, Annabeth, and Grover are standing at the front, she\u2019s clearly addressing Bianca and Nico, half hidden behind them. \u201cYour father requests your presence at the palace. Please,\u201d she gestures with one nasty claw, \u201cfollow me.\u201d\n\n\nThe Furies take them through the un-scenic route to Hades\u2019s throne room, so Percy doesn\u2019t even have to \u201caccidently\u201d let Luke\u2019s shoes escape from his backpack and take a dive into the pit. They get marched down a stone walkway with high walls covered by brown tendrils of ivy. If it weren\u2019t for the high stalactite sky overhead, Percy would think that they were going through part of the labyrinth.\n\n\nPercy thinks it\u2019s smart of the Furies to not let Nico and Bianca see the pale melancholy of the Fields of Asphodel or hear the souls screaming in the Fields of Punishment. But he still understands Maria di Angelo a lot better now. He doesn\u2019t like to picture Nico and Bianca growing up here, the only two bright spots in someplace so dead. At best, they\u2019ll have Hades to care for them. At worst, they\u2019ll only have each other. Or themselves.\n\n\nMaybe Percy should assign them pen pals. Is Will Solace at Camp Half-Blood yet?\u00a0\n\n\nThe skeleton soldiers salute as Nico and Bianca enter the hall, and Hades is no longer an arrogant god waiting to taunt Percy from his throne.\n\n\nInstead, he\u2019s a man in a black suit, hair tied back and face pale, looking at his children for the first time in seventy years.\n\n\nNico takes two steps forward, but then Bianca puts her hand on his shoulder, holding him back.\n\n\nWhich is good, because Percy suddenly can\u2019t do it. He sways on his feet, and for some reason, he doesn\u2019t have the energy to respond to Annabeth elbowing him in the ribs or Grover whispering his name. He wants to lie down forever, curl up at Hades\u2019s feet and sleep.\n\n\nJust sleep.\n\n\nThen there are a dozen bayonets pointing at him, Annabeth, and Grover.\u00a0\n\n\nBianca whirls around, shoulders tense. Nico cries out.\n\n\nThere\u2019s no time to feel tired. Percy grabs the handful of pearls in his pocket, swiftly shoving away all thoughts of sleep and the quiet whisper of \n\nWhy is Hades affecting me more this time?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe lifts his head just in time to catch Hades\u2019s glare.\n\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Hades says, \u201cis the meaning of this, Percy Jackson?\u201d\n\n\nPercy cocks his head to one side and replies, \u201cYou\u2019re not so tough when the turns have tabled, huh.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPercy,\u201d Grover hisses. Annabeth sends a look his way, too, but Percy can see that she still has her dagger out, tucked up against the inside of her forearm.\n\n\nPercy is about to continue by saying something diplomatic, like \u201cGive me my mom back, you complete jackass,\u201d when Nico ducks out of Bianca\u2019s grip and steps forward, drawing Hades\u2019s attention away.\n\n\nNico asks, \u201cAre you our dad?\u201d\n\n\nHis words echo strangely in the palace of the dead.\n\n\nHades\u2019s shoulders rise and fall under the smooth fabric of his suit.\n\n\n\u201cNico,\u201d he says. His voice is hoarse. \u201cBianca.\u201d Hades nods at her, but she doesn\u2019t respond, caught between Nico and the rest of them, surrounded by swords and soldiers.\u00a0\n\n\nHades glances between his two children, drinking in their features like he\u2019s the one who has been eternally starving in the Fields of Punishment.\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, he clears his throat and tells them, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\nJust one small word. It resounds like the strike of metal upon metal, the last heavy mechanism of an ancient lock sliding into place.\n\n\nPercy lets out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding.\u00a0\n\n\nBianca steps closer to her father, slowly, like iron drawn to a magnet.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhy did you make your lawyer tell us you died?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t safe,\u201d Hades says, after a moment. His eyes are fixed on hers. \u201cI was protecting you. Both of you.\u201d\n\n\nThat\u2019s not a good answer. Percy can see Bianca clench her fists, her shoulders rising.\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t even get a chance to dodge past the skeleton soldiers before she explodes.\n\n\n\u201cHow is leaving us at a random hotel safe?\u201d Bianca yells. She\u2019s storming past Nico now, pointing her index finger at her father\u2019s nose. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed\u2014You\u2019re a god! I don\u2019t get it! I don\u2019t get you at all! If you wanted to protect us, then all you had to do was not leave us! If you wanted to keep us safe, then you should have kept us by your side, like any normal parent! And then, instead of taking care of Nico all the time, I could have\u2014I could\u2014\u201d\n\n\nBianca\u2019s words get choked off, her shoulders heaving.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen Hades raises a hand, Percy presses forward, one bayonet digging into his throat, but the hand doesn\u2019t come down in a blow. Instead, it just hovers over Bianca\u2019s bent head, wavering and unsure.\n\n\nPercy stops struggling.\n\n\n\u201cBianca?\u201d Nico says. He walks to her side and pulls at her hand until her fingers are no longer curled into her palm.\n\n\nBianca stares down at her brother. She takes his hand.\n\n\nShe starts, \u201cI just wanted\u2014\u201d\n\n\nA heavy silence.\n\n\nBianca shakes her head.\u00a0\n\n\nShe looks up at Hades and says, \u201cYou were wrong to leave us. Family sticks together. Even when it\u2019s hard.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cEspecially when it\u2019s hard,\u201d Nico adds.\n\n\nStanding tall before the god of the dead, the di Angelos have never looked more powerful.\n\n\nHades\u2014slowly, carefully, gently\u2014places his hand on Bianca\u2019s head. It becomes a stroke of her hair, a caress of her cheek.\n\n\n\u201cI...apologize,\u201d he whispers.\n\n\nBianca takes a step back, pulling Nico with her.\n\n\nHades looks like he\u2019s been slapped.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t accept,\u201d Bianca says. \u201cDon\u2019t tell us you\u2019re sorry. Show us.\u201d\n\n\nShe glances back at Percy. He can see that she\u2019s smiling.\n\n\nPercy calls out, \u201cYeah, Uncle Hades. You can start by giving my mom back.\u201d\n\n\nHades\u2019s gaze snaps to Percy.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he says, sounding bored, \u201care you still here? Will you not be satisfied until you can start Daddy Poseidon\u2019s little war, godling?\u201d\n\n\nOh, right.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy knew that he was forgetting something.\n\n\nBianca frowns. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo he has lied to you, too,\u201d Hades smiles coldly. \u201cListen well, children. Percy Jackson stole the master bolt, then he stole my own helm of darkness, and then he stole \n\nyou,\n\n all to pull me into his father\u2019s conflict. Another cruel war between brothers. This is what your cousins are like,\u201d Hades says, spreading his arms. His suit melts away into black silk robes, and he looms over his children. \u201cThis boy would spill your blood for a simple glance from his father. Remember this, Nico, Bianca: Olympus is not our family. They would sooner kill you than treat you with compassion.\u201d\n\n\nNico goes pale. Bianca tugs him close, her back hunched.\n\n\nPercy can feel his anger boiling under his skin.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d he shouts. Bristling, he turns to Bianca, ignoring the soldier jabbing him in the collarbone with his bayonet, and says, \u201cSorry, Bianca, I forgot to warn you that your dad is a crazy delusional conspiracy theorist.\u201d\n\n\nGrover whimpers. Annabeth shifts, subtly bumping Percy back until he can no longer feel the pressure of the blade against his skin.\n\n\n\u201cThen what is that in your backpack?\u201d Hades sneers.\n\n\nPercy knows better than to check right now. \u201cA trap\u201d he says, \u201cfrom someone who\u2019s playing you like a fool.\u201d\n\n\nHades rolls his eyes. Percy wonders how quickly Nico will pick that up. \u201cA likely story.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCheck your basement for rats, if you don\u2019t believe me. I think you\u2019ll find that you\u2019re beginning to have an infestation, Uncle Hades,\u201d Percy taunts. \u201cYou better hope that no social workers find their way into the Underworld. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d call this a suitable place to raise two kids in.\u201d\n\n\nIf Hades\u2019s glare was a physical force, Percy would be so dead right now. But then he\u2019d be free to cause trouble for Hades forever, so that would actually be a win.\n\n\n\u201cTake them to the cells,\u201d Hades says. \u201cAnd deal with them.\u201d\n\n\nA soldier grabs Percy by the arm, so he punches him in the spine. He can hear the thunk of Annabeth\u2019s dagger on bone from behind him, and Grover isn\u2019t screaming too loudly, so he must be holding his own, too.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy kicks one skeleton hard enough that it trips into another that Annabeth just de-legged. This buys him enough time to split up the pearls.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t!,\u201d Nico yells, running into the fray, Bianca following. The skeleton soldiers immediately freeze. \u201cPlease, Dad.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStand aside, Nico. Bianca\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bianca says. She\u2019s standing in front of them, arms outspread. Even though she\u2019s mirroring the position Hades held just moments ago, she\u2019s never looked less like her father.\u00a0\n\n\nOr more like her mom.\n\n\nNico pulls at Percy\u2019s sleeve. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding,\u201d he says, eyes big and worried.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Here,\u201d Percy whispers. He presses one pearl into Nico\u2019s hands, then turns Bianca around and gives her the other. \u201cDon\u2019t let your dad take these. If you ever want to leave, smash one at your feet. The sea will help you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPercy\u2014\u201d Bianca starts.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Percy tries to smile.\n\n\nHe backs away from the di Angelos, pushing Annabeth and Grover towards the exit behind them.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll return your helm, Uncle,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd once I do, my mom better be back in New York, healthy and safe. Or else you won\u2019t like what I do to you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cArrogant child!\u201d Hades bellows. \u201cYou will not\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d Percy yells over him, \u201cmy birthday\u2019s in August, not that I\u2019m expecting a present from you. But that means anyone who wants Nico and Bianca will have to go through me first!\u201d\n\n\nAnd before he can see Hades\u2019s reaction to that, Percy whirls around, his hand open, three pearls sitting in the palm of his hand.\n\n\n\u201cTake one and smash it on the floor,\u201d Percy tells Annabeth and Grover.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell, what are you waiting for! Destroy them!\u201d Hades shouts.\n\n\n\u201cFather!\u201d Bianca says, just as Nico cries, \u201cPercy!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d\n\n\nThe crack of shotguns fills the room.\n\n\nWhile Annabeth and Grover duck, Percy braces himself.\u00a0\n\n\nLuckily, the bubbles form just in time to keep them from each taking a dozen bullets to the head.\n\n\n\u201cHow do you control these things?!\u201d Annabeth asks.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna crash!\u2019 Grover yelps.\n\n\nPercy would explain, but he\u2019s too busy yelling at Hades. \u201cAnd one more thing! Next time you get tired of playing with your kids, don\u2019t leave them at the Lotus. Just build them a game room! It\u2019d help with the decor!\u201d\n\n\nHe isn\u2019t sure if Hades can hear him over all of Grover and Annabeth\u2019s screaming, but his expression says that he wants to murder Percy in an extremely painful way.\u00a0\n\n\nSo he probably got the general idea.\n\n\nAnd with one last wave to Nico and Bianca, Percy\u2019s crashing through the stalactite ceiling of the Underworld and straight into the sea.\u00a0\n\n\nWhere he belongs.\n\nWhen Percy breaks the surface, Annabeth is treading water at a marching tempo, her eyes wide, and Grover is splashing away from him, yelling, \u201cPercy! Shark!\u201d\nPercy looks down.\nThe mako shark bumps its snout against Percy\u2019s chest, avoiding the cut on his collarbone that\u2019s quickly knitting together. Percy pats it twice on the head, and then he goes to collect his friends, who are pale and tired and soaked.\nBecause they just had to escape from the Underworld while under heavy gunfire. Again.\nPercy is bad at this, isn\u2019t he?\nThe mako shark swims them to the shallows, Percy clinging to its dorsal fin, Annabeth clinging to Percy, and Grover clinging to Annabeth, so they look like some sort of weird aquatic conga line. They drag themselves the rest of the way to shore and half-collapse onto the brown sand.\n\u201cThe\u2014\u201d Grover coughs, spitting salt water. \u201cThe master bolt isn\u2019t really in your backpack, is it?\u201d\nPercy shrugs it off and tosses it to him. His hands are shaking.\nHades didn\u2019t even show him his mom this time.\nIt wasn't supposed to be like this.\n\u201cHoly\u2014Look!\u201d Grover says. \u201cI-I can\u2019t believe this. How did this happen?\u201d\nPercy has the answers. He can explain. But if he opens his mouth right now, he\u2019s afraid that the only thing that will come out is a scream. Or a sob. Or something worse.\u00a0\nRight now, all he can do is stay like this, on his hands and knees in the sand.\nAnnabeth stands, her sneakers pacing back and forth across the sand above Percy\u2019s head.\n\u201cThat means\u2026\u201d she trails off. \u201cShit, it must have been\u2014\u201d\nHe\u2019d been so stupid. Why did he think taking Nico and Bianca to Hades was a good idea? Did he think Hades would be grateful or reasonable or kind? Now the di Angelos are trapped underground with a guy who\u2019ll probably manipulate and bully them instead of trying to be an actual good parent and Hades didn\u2019t even offer him a deal before trying to kill him so Luke and Kronos\u2019s war might actually happen this time and Annabeth and Grover were almost killed again just for being there, and  Percy still didn\u2019t save his mom. \nHe didn\u2019t even get to see her. It\u2019s been so long.\n\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d\nWhat if he\u2014\nWhat if she\u2019s\u2014\nFuck.\nStupid. Percy\u2019s so stupid.\nWhy is he so  stupid? \nAnnabeth lets out a strangled sound.\n\u201cThen what was the point of all this! This is just like\u2014Goddamnit! And Percy, how did you\u2014\u201d\u00a0\nThe words break off.\u00a0\n\u201cPercy?\u201d\nAnnabeth\u2019s sneakers take a break from their angry stomping. Percy stares blankly at her wet shoelaces, sprinkled with sand.\nSlowly, Annabeth crouches down.\u00a0\nShe places a hand on his shoulder.\nPercy tries to focus on the weight of her palm. Despite the fabric of his shirt between them and the cool ocean breeze, her hand feels warm.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your mom, Percy,\u201d Annabeth whispers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry...\u201d\n\u201cWould you look at that!\u201d Ares calls, and Percy jolts like he\u2019s just been electrocuted by Thalia again. \u201cHow sweet.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no time to feel sorry for himself. Percy shrugs off Annabeth\u2019s hand and gets to his feet.\n\u201cHey, kid,\u201d Ares grins. \u201cYou were supposed to die down there.\u201d\nPercy opens his mouth, chokes, clears his throat, tries again.\n\u201cI\u2019m good at not dying when I\u2019m supposed to,\u201d he croaks. \u201cIt\u2019s just natural talent.\u201d\nAres tilts his head back and laughs. Percy\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s not because he finds him funny.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Ares says, brushing some sand off the shoulder of his black leather duster, \u201cevery talent has its limits. Yours are here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Percy uncaps his sword. \u201cWith the grave of your shattered dignity after you get nerfed by a twelve year old.\u201d\nEven behind the sunglasses, Ares\u2019s eyes visibly flare up.\nAnnabeth is pulling at the hem of Percy\u2019s shirt. \u201cShut up,\u201d she hisses, \u201cshut up, shut up, shut up right now!\u201d\nGrover hugs the backpack to his chest and whimpers, \u201cHoly Hades, we\u2019re all gonna die.\u201d\n\u201cYou got a big mouth, cousin,\u201d Ares says. \u201cBut, the gods have rules too: no direct involvement. And even if I could, why would I bother? You\u2019re not on my level.\u201d\nPercy holds back the urge to roll his eyes. It\u2019s the second toughest thing he\u2019s had to do in the last hour, right behind abandoning his mom in the Underworld again.\nNo time. Ares snaps his fingers.\nThe sand at his feet explodes, and out of the storm charges the butt-ugly wild boar Ares likes to throw around. It paws at the shore, kicking up seashell shards.\nPercy doesn\u2019t even bother with Riptide. He reaches back and summons the sea water soaking Grover\u2019s and Annabeth\u2019s clothes, their hair. Droplets upon droplets spin around his arm, a sleeve sewn out of a whitewater rapid.  Sharp  , Percy thinks, remembering the zebra\u2019s cage.  Blade .\u00a0\nIf put under enough pressure, water can even cut through steel.\u00a0\nPercy thinks he\u2019s feeling pressured enough.\nThe boar rushes forward.\nPercy pushes the water away from him.\nA shriek. The boar slows, wrenching its head from side to side in agony, but it\u2019s still moving towards them, blind.\nMore. Percy needs more.\nA wave crashes at his heels, the spray falling about him like a shawl of diamond dust. Percy twists his hand.\u00a0\nThe ocean obeys.\nUgh. The noise is terrible. Out of the corner of his eye, Percy sees Annabeth clamp her hands over her ears.\nWhen Percy finally drops his arm, there\u2019s an invisible hand twisting in his guts and nothing but a pile of minced meat on the sand.\nAnnabeth inhales sharply.\nGrover gags.\n\u201cNow that,\u201d Ares says, \u201cwas interesting.\u201d He glances at Percy over the top of his melting sunglasses and grins with all his teeth. \u201cAny chance you\u2019d like to start a war with me, little cousin? After that performance, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d enjoy it.\u201d\nAnnabeth starts, her hand going towards her dagger, but Percy steps forward before she can draw.\n\u201cPercy?\u201d\nPercy walks towards Ares, Riptide dangling at his side.\u00a0\nHe stops when he reaches the mess on the beach. His sneakers brush the pile of ground pork on the sand.\u00a0\nThen Percy spits a mouthful of bile at Ares\u2019s feet.\u00a0\nAres lurches backward, his face twisted in disgust.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Percy says, wiping his mouth, \u201care you just going to stand there? Or do you have another pet pig to hide behind?\u201d\nAres stares, incredulous.\u00a0\nFor a second, there\u2019s no sound save for the slush of the sea.\nFinally\u2014\u201cFine,\u201d Ares says. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the slow, painful death of your dreams, boy. You won\u2019t stop screaming until they have to dunk your soul in the Lethe.\u201d He taps his baseball bat against his leg, transforming it into his huge, two-handed sword.\u00a0\nPercy\u2019s about to ask Ares if he\u2019s compensating for something when two pairs of hands grab him and drag him back towards the shoreline.\n\u201cWhen did you learn how to do that?\u201d Grover asks. His face is pale.\n\u201cJust now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat in\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGrover, focus,\u201d Annabeth snaps. She grabs Percy by the shoulders and shakes him. \u201cPercy,\u201d she says. \u201cHe is a god. I would tell you not to do this, but you already spat in his face, so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cActually, I spat at his feet.\u201d\nAnnabeth shakes Percy again. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she says. And then she leans down and looks him straight in the eye.\u00a0\nPercy meets her gaze. If he doesn\u2019t look at the rest of her face, he can almost pretend she\u2019s already the person who knows him down to the soul.\nAnnabeth takes a deep breath, lets it out slowly, and quietly asks, \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d\nPercy thinks about it.\n\u201cNot really,\u201d he answers honestly, \u201cbut that hasn\u2019t killed us so far.\u201d\nFor a moment, Annabeth doesn\u2019t do anything but continue searching his eyes. Then she nods. \u201cGood enough.\u201d\n\u201cUm, I wouldn\u2019t say\u2014\u201d Grover starts, but Annabeth raises her hand.\nWith it, she takes off her necklace and loops it around Percy\u2019s head.\n\u201cFor luck,\u201d Annabeth says. \u201cBe careful. He looks serious.\u201d\nGrover extracts a crushed coke can from his pocket and presses it into Percy\u2019s hand. \u201cTake this, too. The satyrs are with you,\u201d he says. His lips twitch in a shadow of a smile, and his brow is tightly knit.\n\u201cThanks, guys.\u201d Percy wraps his friends into a hug. Then he lets them go, pushing them towards the dock. \u201cKeep a safe distance,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\nAres is still standing by the remains of his boar, tapping his sword against his boot like a metronome. When he sees Percy turn to him, he grins humorlessly and drops into a fighting stance.\n\u201cNow that the goodbyes are all done\u2026\u201d he says. And then he\u2019s charging.\nAres is the first person Percy\u2019s really fought since coming back, and the learning curve is steep. His jabs don\u2019t go as far as he expects them to. His slashes aren\u2019t wide enough. He can\u2019t jump that high without the push of the sea water he\u2019s continuously summoning from the tide. He\u2019s still aching from the waterjet trick, which isn\u2019t helping.\u00a0\nAnd it\u2019s possible that Ares is taking this more seriously than last time, too. When his blade crashes against Riptide, Percy can feel the vibration of the force in his bones. He bats Percy away from the ocean without ever turning his back on the waves. He isn\u2019t even smiling.\nAres won\u2019t wade into the sea to kill Percy if he pretends to be defeated. As soon as Percy stops fighting, Ares will mutilate him until he begs to die.\nActually, Ares is already mutilating him. Each time one of Percy\u2019s attacks gets knocked back, Ares uses the recovered distance to land a blow. He takes chunks out of Percy\u2019s arms, his thighs. The only reason why Percy doesn\u2019t have a hole in his abdomen is because he\u2019s using the sea water to heal all the damage to his organs. He needs to hold his body together.\u00a0\nUnfortunately this means that Percy\u2019s focus is split between fighting Ares and performing water-based field medicine, and it\u2019s not doing him any favors. Percy dodges a swipe at his shoulder, and Ares knocks his sword away, kicking him in the chest.\nPercy flies thirty feet back, the impact knocking something loose in his body.\n\u201cPercy!\u201d Annabeth yells, just as Grover yelps, \u201cCops!\u201d\nOh, right. Percy pushes himself up despite how his body screams at him. The sirens start blaring.\nAres is approaching him like he has all the time in the world. But, his sword is still raised. His face is sharp and emotionless. For the first time, Percy can see him as a god.\nThat\u2019s probably the blood loss talking, though.\nPercy blinks, his vision blurring red. Red from the blood dripping out of his hair, red from the cop cars pulling up around him. The voices pick up, the sirens wailing. It\u2019s like the whole world is screaming at him.\nIt\u2019s like the whole world is screaming at him. Suddenly, he\u2019s aware of everything. Annabeth and Grover clinging to each other on the docks, the crowds of spectators and reporters swarming, the police calling more officers in to deal with an active shooter, the flap of leathery wings circling somewhere above.\nAnd below him, something different. Something stirring.\nWait.\nBelow?\nDoes that mean\u2026?\nNo time. Percy hears Annabeth and Grover scream as Ares charges towards him, his eyes burning. The sirens blare, and the policemen yell, and far away, there are voices that sound like Nico and Bianca, calling his name. And Percy needs the ocean, needs to call more water to him, but Ares is closer than the tide and Percy\u2019s too tired to be fast and his blood drains into the sand and to the thing down there\u2014Percy needs more time he needs more time Ares\u2019s blade is four feet away he needs more time three feet away his friends are screaming he needs to stop Ares two feet he needs Ares to stop one stop stop stop stop  stop \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPercy opens his eyes.\u00a0\nHe hadn\u2019t even realized that he\u2019d closed them.\nThe point of Ares\u2019s sword is trembling against Percy\u2019s jugular. Then it tumbles to the sand, slicing a curved wound across his throat.\u00a0\nThe palm of Percy\u2019s outstretched hand is tilted up towards Ares\u2019s head. Once Percy puts his arm down, he can see that the right half of Ares\u2019s face is drooping. He\u2019s staring blankly at the space above Percy.\nAres\u2019s right hand twitches, but he can\u2019t seem to move his arm from where it\u2019s sagging at his side.\u00a0\nHe stumbles forward, falling to the sand.\nAres vomits on Percy\u2019s sneakers.\nOkay, he\u2019s actually just heaving and gagging\u2014No godly stomach acid or anything\u2014but still. It\u2019s the thought that counts.\nPercy scrambles backwards, doing his best not to hurl for real. It feels like the Nemean Lion just clawed out all his guts and replaced them with Jello.\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ares coughs. His eyes are unfocused. \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\nPercy pats his pockets and finds Riptide there.\nHe quickly uncaps his sword, pressing it to the side of Ares\u2019s neck.\nA droplet of ichor buds at the edge of the blade.\nAres freezes.\n\u201cDrop the helm,\u201d Percy says. \u201cAnd fuck off.\u201d\nHis voice cracks. His hand is shaking.\nWhat did he just do?\n\u201cPer\u2014\u201d Ares says, but his mouth can\u2019t seem to find the rest of the word. He tries again, his lips trying to wrap themselves around a sound that has escaped from him.\u00a0\nFinally, Ares just shakes his head. He stares up at Percy.\nSyllable by syllable, he bites out, \u201cYou\u2019ll regret this.\u201d\nPercy looks away as he starts glowing.\nAres disappears in a flash of light. Hades\u2019s helm is left in his place.\nPercy caps Riptide. He would pick up the helm, but it feels like if he moves, his internal organs might spill out of his ribs, so he doesn\u2019t.\nSoft footsteps in the sand.\n\u201cPercy,\u201d Annabeth says. Her voice sounds as weak as he feels. \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\nThe sound of wings cutting through the air.\nThe Furies land in front of Percy, on the other side of the helm. They\u2019re carrying Nico and Bianca with them.\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurt!\u201d Bianca says.\nAt the same time, Nico points and says, \u201cIs that Dad\u2019s?\u201d\nRight. More business to get done. No time to dwell on\u2014this.\nPercy pulls himself together. \u201cYeah,\u201d he tells Nico. He takes a deep breath and wishes he could summon some sea water to wash the blood off his arms and face without blacking out. \u201cYou wanna try it on?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Nico cries, scooping the helm out of the sand.\nWhile Bianca tries to keep Nico from sticking his head into their father\u2019s symbol of power, Percy turns to the Fury who was once Mrs. Dodds.\u00a0\n\u201cSo,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mom?\u201d\nMrs. Dodds gives him a look like she doesn\u2019t know what to think of him. \u201cLord Hades is honorable. You will find her back in your dwelling.\u201d\nPercy nods.\nThen he closes his eyes and tries not to cry.\n\u201cGood,\u201d he says. And then he must have swayed or something, because suddenly Grover\u2019s gripping his forearms, holding him steady.\n\u201cPercy!\u201d\nPercy hisses as Grover presses down on one of his cuts.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he says.\nBianca turns from where she\u2019s holding the helm out of the reach of Nico\u2019s waving arms. She looks like she wants to move towards them, but then Mrs. Dodds grabs her shoulder with one clawed hand.\n\u201cTime to return home, children,\u201d she says.\nNico\u2019s face falls. He glances at Percy. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGo home, Nico,\u201d Percy says. He straightens up, or at least tries not to look like he\u2019s leaning his entire weight on Grover. \u201cGo spend some time with your dad. I\u2019m surprised he let you two out at all,\u201d he adds.\n\u201cBianca was really convincing,\u201d Nico grins.\nAnnabeth steps forward, wrapping her arm around Percy\u2019s waist and taking some weight off Grover. She nods at Bianca. \u201cNever back down from your dad. It doesn\u2019t get you anywhere.\u201d\nBianca starts a little, as if surprised to be spoken to.\nThen she grins, too.\u00a0\nOne of Mrs. Dodds\u2019s sisters has just scooped Nico up when Percy remembers\u2014\n\u201cHold on a sec!\u201d\nPercy waves Bianca over as the Furies watch, a suspicious glint in their eyes.\n\u201cGrover?\u201d Percy says quietly. \u201cDo you have an extra business card?\u201d\n\u201cOh! Um\u2026\u201d Grover searches his pockets with the hand he\u2019s not using to keep Percy upright and finds a crumpled, salt-stained card. He hands it to Bianca.\nPercy tells her, \u201cContact Camp Half-Blood if anything comes up. Anything.\u201d Percy looks at the Furies, then back at Bianca. \u201cWe\u2019re here to protect you.\u201d\nBianca nods slowly, folding the card into her closed fist.\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she says.\nAs the Furies fly the di Angelos away, Nico waves with his entire arm, calling \u201cBye!\u201d so loudly that Percy can feel the sound echoing in his head.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Annabeth says. When Percy turns to look at her, she glances away. \u201cThat\u2019s one symbol of power returned.\u201d\nGrover nods. \u201cOne down, one to go.\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound very excited.\u00a0\nPercy can relate.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Percy says. \u201cTime to go home.\u201d\nNone of them move.\n\u201cUh, guys?\u201d Grover asks. \u201cQuick question. How are we getting back to New York? Wait, don\u2019t tell me\u2014another cross-country roadtrip?\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound very excited.\nPercy turns his head so that he can see the police cars over Grover\u2019s shoulder and the crowd pointing at them and the news van parked at the mouth of the dock.\nHe smiles.\n\u201cI think I have a plan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\nAfter Annabeth and Grover dunk Percy into the ocean, they go do his plan.\nRipping off Smelly Gabe is just as satisfying the second time around, and Percy even decides to enjoy the airplane ride this time. He won\u2019t ever get to try it again, after all, and riding around in a flying warship isn\u2019t exactly the same.\nPercy still feels sick and nervous the whole flight, but that has less to do with being afraid of Zeus blasting him out of the sky and more to do with how Annabeth stares at him when she doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s paying attention. She hasn\u2019t said anything to him since asking if he was still bleeding anywhere.\nThat seems like a bad sign.\nPercy doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019s thinking about the di Angelos or the wild boar or whatever he did to Ares or all of the above. All he knows is that he\u2019ll worry about it later. If he gets to camp and Chiron is there to lead everyone in chasing him off Half-Blood Hill while waving pitchforks, then he\u2019ll figure out what to do.\nRight now, he has a lightning bolt to return.\nIf six years of future experience has taught Percy anything, it\u2019s that he should never kneel to Zeus, because fuck that guy. As far as Percy can tell, the only good things that ever came from Zeus are Thalia and Jason, sort of. And Zeus wasn\u2019t even really involved in that.\nSo, yeah, once Percy makes his way to Olympus\u2019s throne room, he kneels to his father. Zeus can suck his prepubescent dick.\u00a0\nPercy gives his report on his quest while staring at the space next to Zeus\u2019s giant head, because he\u2019s afraid that if he looks Zeus in the face, he\u2019ll instinctively call him a huge jerkass. When he finishes, there\u2019s a long silence, possibly because he doesn\u2019t remember a ton of the first half of his quest and had to cut the di Angelos out of the second half. Which means that his report was pretty much just, \u201cAres stole both the bolt and the helm because he wanted to start a war. Hades thought I stole them to force him to fight in the war he thought Poseidon wanted to start. I beat Ares\u2019s ass and got the bolt and the helm back. You are all very stupid, and I want to take a nap.\u201d\nExcept Percy didn\u2019t actually call the gods stupid.\nHe really wanted to, though.\nAnd Percy would like to say that he feels bad about making Ares take all the blame this time around, but he really doesn\u2019t. Honestly, he doesn\u2019t care what Zeus does to Ares, as long as it\u2019s not turning him into a human and having him sacrifice the demigods he\u2019s treated horribly to earn his godhood back.\nZeus wouldn\u2019t do that, right?\nRight?\nPercy hopes he hasn\u2019t made another terrible mistake.\nAnd it\u2019s with that happy thought that Percy watches Zeus make his dramatic exit in order to scrub the human off his bolt.\u00a0\nNow it\u2019s just Percy and his dad. Talking for the first time. For the second time.\nPercy stares down at his bloody, beat-up sneakers. He actually remembers how this interaction went, and frankly, he doesn\u2019t want to do it again.\n\u201cPerseus.\u201d A weathered hand gently tilts Percy\u2019s chin up. \u201cLook at me,\u201d Poseidon says.\nPercy fixes his gaze on Poseidon\u2019s left shoulder.\n\u201cThere is something you did not tell us.\u201d\n\u201cNo, there isn\u2019t.\u201d\nPoseidon crosses his arms and waits.\nPercy lasts about nine seconds. Then he sighs and actually looks his father in the face.\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have believed me,\u201d Percy says. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t either.\u201d\nPoseidon raises an eyebrow. Percy can now confirm that his inability to do a good eyebrow raise is not genetic. \u201cYou seem very confident about that,\u201d Poseidon says.\nPercy shrugs. \u201cNo one likes bad news.\u201d He would know. He\u2019s been bad news for basically his entire life.\nPoseidon looks at him, expression unreadable. Percy gets the feeling that he doesn\u2019t know what to think of him.\nIt\u2019s an uncomfortable look to get from the guy who once called Percy his favorite son. Then again, that only happened once, in a future that no longer exists.\nPercy shifts his gaze back to Poseidon\u2019s shoulder.\nAfter another tense moment, he hears a sigh.\n\u201cYou should go, Perseus,\u201d Poseidon says. \u201cYour mother is waiting for you.\u201d\n\u201cMy mom\u2019s safe?\u201d Percy asks. She should be, he knows, but still. He wants to be sure.\nPoseidon smiles. \u201cEven the Lord of Death pays his debts.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t seem like a very brotherly compliment. But, it\u2019s not Percy\u2019s problem.\nPercy looks down at his sneakers again, before refocusing on his dad\u2019s face. \u201cWill you ever go see her again?\u201d he asks.\nPoseidon hesitates. \u201cYour mother is a queen among women. But, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d He trails off, eyes focused on something Percy can\u2019t see. Then he shakes his head once and smiles. \u201cI would only bring her trouble,\u201d Poseidon finishes. Then his tone hardens. \u201cWhen you return home, Percy, you must make an important choice. You will find a package waiting in your room.\u201d\nYes, the package!\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be done,\u201d Percy nods. He hopes that his mom\u2019s new art piece will sell just as well this time around.\nPercy\u2019s so busy thinking about garden statues and new advances in super-ugly neorealism that he doesn\u2019t notice Poseidon studying his face until he meets his eyes.\nHe looks so sad. Was his dad this sad last time?\nPoseidon opens his mouth, closes it, tries again.\u00a0\nHe says, \u201cI am sorry you were born, child. I have brought you a hero\u2019s fate, and a hero\u2019s fate is never happy. It is never anything but tragic.\u201d\nHis gaze is tracing the rips and stains in Percy\u2019s shirt.\nPercy looks at his dad.\u00a0\nHere is a god who, in another life, will build Percy a fountain full of gold so he can keep in touch with his family. He\u2019ll do his best to keep Zeus from frying Percy without breaking the so-called rules of the gods. He\u2019ll come celebrate Percy\u2019s fifteenth birthday and make awkward conversation with his stepfather. He\u2019ll come fight with the rest of Olympus at Percy\u2019s call. He\u2019ll do his best to keep Percy safe. He\u2019ll do his best to love him.\nIt won\u2019t be enough.\n\u201cCan I hug you?\u201d Percy blurts out.\nPoseidon stares.\nPercy can feel his face go totally red.\nIs it too late to call Zeus back? Percy would really like to have his life un-spared right now.\nThen, Poseidon slowly opens his arms.\nPercy\u2019s dad smells like salt and brine and the cool sea breeze. His arms are heavy and warm around his back. The ocean roils under his skin, and his heartbeat follows the undulation of a wave. When he hugs Percy, he surrounds him entirely.\u00a0\nPercy presses his face into his dad\u2019s shirt.  Is this what it feels like to be safe?  he wonders.\nPoseidon\u2019s rubbing small circles in between his shoulder blades. It\u2019s nice. Comforting\n\n Is this what it feels like\u2014 \n\nPercy cuts himself off.\u00a0\nHe can\u2019t think about that at all.\nHe can\u2019t associate safety with something he\u2019ll only have once in his life.\nPercy clutches at the back of his dad\u2019s Hawaiian shirt.\n\u201cI make my own choices,\u201d he says, voice muffled in the fabric. \u201cYou\u2019re not responsible for the things I do.\u201d\nPoseidon\u2019s hand stills. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nPercy reluctantly extracts himself from the hug, pulling his dad\u2019s hands off of his back. He squeezes them once, before letting go.\n\u201cRemember,\u201d Percy says, backing away. He keeps his eyes on his father the entire time. \u201cWhatever happens to me isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d\n\u201cPerseus?\u201d Poseidon calls.\nBut Percy\u2019s already gone.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\nPercy would think that after years of killing and almost getting killed by monsters, after years of war with titans and primordials, after years of watching the people he loves get hurt and die and die and die, a dirty little apartment and the dirty men inside wouldn\u2019t be scary at all. In fact, they shouldn\u2019t even be a blip on the trauma radar.\nBut one step into Gabeland, and suddenly Percy\u2019s nothing more than that coward who stupidly paid his dog-walking money to the man who hit his mom. He\u2019s furious with Smelly Gabe and his stupid friends. He wants to make the pipes burst above their head and freeze them in the falling water. He wants to make them scream in terror and beg for their lives. He wants\u2014\n\u201cPercy!\u201d And there are arms wrapping around him. \u201cOh, thank goodness. Oh, my baby.\u201d\nPercy can\u2019t say anything. He hugs his mom as tight as he can and does his best not to cry.\nHis best is not very good. Percy\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s getting snot on his mom\u2019s shirt.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he says into her shoulder.\n\u201cI\u2019m alright. I...don\u2019t remember much after we crashed.\u201d His mom steps back, so she can take a good look at him. As she assesses his clothes, her eyes widen, and she starts pulling back the rips, checking the skin underneath for wounds.\n\u201cMom!\u201d Percy squawks, brushing off her hands and crossing his arms over his chest.\nHis mom gives him a look.\n\u201cPercy,\u201d she says, \u201ctell me what happened.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d Percy nudges an empty beer can with his toe. \u201cI kind of\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHey, Sally!\u201d yells Gabe. \u201cThat meatloaf done yet or what?\u201d\nRight. They should deal with that first.\nPercy takes his mom\u2019s hand and starts leading her over to his room.\n\u201cPercy, your stepfather\u2014\n\u201cJust ignore him, Mom.\u201d\nOf course, just like all the other bullies in Percy\u2019s life, Smelly Gabe has never been happy to be ignored. As they cross the apartment, Gabe stands up with some difficulty, looking even bigger and uglier than the shadow in Percy\u2019s memory.\n\u201cYou got some nerve coming here, you little\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPercy\u2014\u201d his mom whispers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Percy places a hand on his mom\u2019s elbow, moving her so that he\u2019s always between her and Gabe.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s not tall enough to shield her from Smelly Gabe\u2019s line of sight, but if Gabe tries to touch her, he\u2019ll have to go through Percy first.\n\u201c\u2014call the cops! You hear me, punk?\u201d\nThey\u2019re almost there. They\u2019re almost there.\n\u201cHey.\u201d A meaty hand grabs onto Percy\u2019s shoulder and wrenches him around.\u00a0\nGabe looks down at Percy with his dull, beady eyes and says, \u201cYou think you can ignore me, after all the shit you\u2019ve pulled?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t talk to worthless pigs,\u201d Percy spits.\nGabe leans over him, getting in his face.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m worthless,\u201d Gabe says, the stench of his beer breath suffocating, \u201cthen what does that make you?\u201d\nAnd that. Well, that\u2019s the stupidest comeback Percy\u2019s ever heard. Smelly Gabe could\u2019ve just said, \u201cI know you are, but what am I,\u201d and it would\u2019ve been the same.\nSo, Percy shouldn\u2019t be angry. And he\u2019s not.\nBut he spotted the way Gabe\u2019s eyes had flickered to his mom on the word \u201cworthless.\u201d And that\u2019s just not acceptable.\nPercy\u2019s not angry.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s furious.\nHe stares into Gabe\u2019s stupid, mean face and thinks,  I could kill you with your own beer. I could use your spit to cut your throat. \nThe ideas grow like a garden out of control. Percy can mince Gabe up like the other pig on the beach. He\u2019ll chop him up until he cries, and then he\u2019ll choke him to death with his own tears. Or maybe he\u2019ll make him kneel like Ares did, make him kneel before his mom and apologize, make him beg for his life, her mercy. And when she\u2019s satisfied, Percy will boil his blood. He can make the meatloaf for once.\nPercy\u2019s fingers are twitching.\nBut.\nBut his mom wouldn\u2019t want that. Doesn\u2019t want that.\nAnd she\u2019s standing right behind him, her hand a warm weight on the back of his neck.\nGabe smirks down at Percy.\u00a0\nBlood rushes through Percy\u2019s head. His fury sounds like an ocean.\nHe could\u2014\nPercy clenches his fists. He digs his fingernails into his palms.\nHis mom is standing right behind him.\u00a0\nShe can\u2019t see him like this.\nPercy squeezes his eyes shut, trying his hardest to wrestle the waves of rage back down inside of him.\nThat\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t see the fist until it slams him to the ground.\n\u201cGabriel!\u201d\nPercy blinks, dazed. His cheek stings, and his mouth tastes like copper. He swipes his tongue against his teeth, checking for loose molars.\nThen he sees that his mom is pointing her finger in Gabe\u2019s face.\u00a0\nNo time.\nPercy shoves himself off the carpet, crushing a stray chip under his palm.\n\u201cIf you ever touch my son again,\u201d his mom is saying, \u201cyou will regret it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Gabe replies. He tries to loom over her, but Percy pushes himself between them. Still, he\u2019s big enough to talk over Percy\u2019s head.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat could  you  do to me?\u201d Gabe asks.\nSilence.\nPercy nudges his mom back.\nGabe smiles nastily. \u201cGo finish the meatloaf, Sally,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nAnd then he goes back to the TV.\nPercy doesn\u2019t move until he sees that Smelly Gabe isn\u2019t coming back for more.\u00a0\nHe grabs his mom\u2019s hand again.\u00a0\n\u201cCome on, Mom,\u201d he mutters. They finally make it to his room.\nAs they walk in, Gabe shouts, \u201cYou better be packing your stuff in there, you piece of shit! If you don\u2019t clear out in two minutes, I\u2019m calling the police!\u201d\nPercy slams the door shut.\nGood riddance.\nImmediately, his mom is fluttering around him, checking his cheek and his lip. Gabe hit him hard enough that his teeth cut into his flesh.\nAs her hand hovers over his face, she says, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, baby. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Mom,\u201d Percy says. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine after a little bit of water, anyway.\u201d\nHis mom shakes her head, and then she wraps him in her arms again.\n\u201cYou got hurt,\u201d she whispers. \u201cThat won\u2019t change.\u201d\n Better me than you , Percy thinks. But he can\u2019t say that without breaking his mom\u2019s heart, so he doesn\u2019t say anything. He just enjoys the warmth of being held.\nEventually, when both he and his mom are feeling calm enough, he asks, \u201cMom. Do you want to get rid of Gabe?\u201d\nShe stiffens, then pulls back so that she and Percy can look at each other.\n\u201cOf course I do, Percy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t that simple. I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo buts, Mom,\u201d Percy interrupts. \u201cYou deserve so much better than this. Did you know that Dad calls you a queen among women?\u201d\nHis mom flushes, looking surprised.\nPercy goes to pick up the package on his bed. He comes back and hands it to her.\n\u201cOne look inside this box, and Gabe will never bother you again. You\u2019ll go to college, get your degree. You\u2019ll finally be able to write your novel, meet a nice guy, live in a nice house with your kid. You\u2019ll be happy. And you\u2019ll be safe.\u201d\n\u201cPercy\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to protect me anymore,\u201d Percy says. \u201cI can protect myself. And so can you. That\u2019s why I\u2019m leaving you the box. If he threatens you...\u201d\nPercy trails off meaningfully.\u00a0\nFor a moment, his mom just stares at the box. Then she looks back at him, her jaw set.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d she says. \u201cI will.\u201d\nPercy nods. He knows.\nHis mom leans down and kisses him on the forehead. \u201cThank you, baby. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you so sorry?\u201d Percy laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re the best person in the world. No goddess could ever compare. I just wish...\u201d\nPercy\u2019s gaze wanders over his mom\u2019s face. She still looks sort of thin and drawn now, but once she starts taking her writing seminar and hanging out with Paul, she\u2019ll brighten up. When Estelle gets here, she\u2019ll be able to outshine Apollo\u2019s chariot. Every street in New York will be like Montauk to her.\n\u201cPercy?\u201d\nHe just wishes he could be a part of it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I have to go back to camp now, Mom. I\u2019ll I-M you every Saturday, though, so keep an eye out for rainbows.\u201d\nHis mom\u2019s hands tighten around the package. \u201cAre you going...forever?\u201d\nPercy looks down. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know. There\u2019s something I need to do, before I can come back.\u201d\nA long silence.\nFinally, Percy\u2019s mom hugs him one last time.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be a hero, Percy,\u201d she says. \u201cThe best hero of them all. Just don\u2019t forget that heroes come home at the end of the day, too, okay?\u201d\nPercy clutches the back of her shirt.\u00a0\nHe closes his eyes.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nWhen Percy gets back to Camp Half-Blood, he\u2019s greeted by cheers, not pitchforks. Which is a relief, because there\u2019s a lot he needs to get done, and he doesn\u2019t want to be distracted by his friends trying to kill him.\n\n\nSometimes Annabeth still looks at him like he\u2019s a monster she wants to dissect, though.\n\n\nThat\u2019s fine. Percy knows what he is.\n\n\nEven so, he can\u2019t help wanting to spend time with her. After a couple days of tense silence, he finds her reading by the climbing wall and asks if she\u2019ll help him reverse engineer the cabin designs to see if there\u2019s an underlying structural style or if each one is a custom job.\n\n\n\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of standing around and watching Annabeth sketch, for the most part. Sometimes she hands him a measuring tape and a compass and asks him to go get her the exact dimensions of a cornice molding or a quoin or something. Percy loses an hour to Katie Gardner when she yells at him for crushing a tomato vine.\u00a0\n\n\nBut, it\u2019s not so bad. The silences between them aren\u2019t that awkward anymore. And on days that Annabeth won\u2019t do anything but draw, she shows up with a bag of blue jelly beans for Percy to munch on as she works. And if Percy just never thinks about how she always has an excuse not to hang out by the canoe lake, he can almost pretend that he\u2019s at Camp Half-Blood after Kronos\u2019s defeat, back when the war was over and felt like it could never touch them again.\n\n\n\nI am never, ever going to make things easy for you, Seaweed Brain.\n\n\n\nPercy convinces himself that Annabeth is still his friend. That\u2019s enough for him.\n\n\nEach Saturday, Percy uses one of the drachmas he liberated from Crusty\u2019s office to I-M his mom from the lake. While he\u2019s in the lake. It takes him a day to figure out where and when he can catch enough sun to actually make a rainbow, but he has an unlimited supply of water to create his mist with. It\u2019s practical, and definitely not something he\u2019s doing to keep Clarisse from making fun of him.\n\n\nHis mom seems sort of worried by the regular calls\u2014Percy never did this when he was at boarding school. But, eventually she seems to chalk it up to him dealing with her almost getting murdered by a Minotaur and then being kidnapped into the Underworld. Percy doesn\u2019t correct her.\n\n\nEvery week, she looks a bit happier. Her statue sold well. She\u2019s taking a short introductory writing seminar right now, and she\u2019s enrolled in a more intense class that starts in the fall. She just befriended this boy Tyson while completing an investigative journalism assignment on Meriwether College Prep\u2019s progressive instructional philosophy. Tyson\u2019s very sweet. She thinks Percy would like him.\n\n\nPercy agrees.\n\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not all fun and games at the summer camp for demigod child soldiers. For example, Luke keeps looking at Percy, and Percy does not like that at all.\u00a0\n\n\nFirstly, it sets off all the danger alarms that Percy has spent four years specifically attuning to Luke. Secondly, it makes it much harder for Percy to sneak into the woods unnoticed.\n\n\nEvery day, Percy tries to spend a couple of hours making friends with the nymphs and the naiads. He clears branches out of the creek. He clips wayward twigs from tree trunks while making conversation with the dryads; they tell him he\u2019d make a good manicurist in his next life. He diverts water to the plants that are thirsty. He cleans the bank where the naiads like to sunbathe; when they invite him back to Long Island Sound, he helps them flush wastewater and runoff out of the coast there, too. He glares off satyrs who are chasing nymphs who don\u2019t want to be chased. They\u2019re a disgrace to Grover, and Percy will not stand for it.\n\n\nIn return, the dryads donate branches, and the naiads help him gather driftwood and stone. He shows them Annabeth\u2019s diagrams and repeats what she\u2019s told him, as close to word for word as he can.\u00a0\n\n\nThe woods are big, and Long Island Sound is bigger. There are a lot of places where secrets can be hidden.\n\n\nEventually, Luke actually starts trying to talk to Percy, which is the worst. Percy refuses to count the number of times he\u2019s hidden in a bathroom stall to escape Luke\u2014He\u2019s pretty sure the whole camp now believes Zeus cursed him with an incurable stomach bug. The rare times that Luke waves Percy down in public, Percy tells him that he\u2019s busy training. That\u2019s not all a lie. Percy does bump into monsters in the woods, and he is trying to get used to his little arms and legs so that he doesn\u2019t get his ass totally whooped again. He\u2019s aiming for half-whooped next time.\n\n\nAnd if Percy never hops into the creek to immediately heal his wounds\u2014if he always spends a couple minutes bleeding into the dirt while reciting \n\nGood Housekeeping\n\n home ideas he begged off his mom\u2014 then that\u2019s no one\u2019s business but his own.\n\n\nWith his last bit of free time, Percy hangs around Grover and tries to keep him from heading off to find Pan. It\u2019s not going great.\n\n\n\u201cSearching for Pan is, like, the entire purpose of my life, dude.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe purpose of your life should be staying healthy, finding happiness, and living to age 203.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPercy\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLook, I just think that\u2014Well, maybe the reason no searcher has ever come back in two thousand years is because something is luring them...somewhere...by faking Pan\u2019s presence. Somehow.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of \u2018some\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlease, Grover. Just wait until next year, okay? It\u2019ll all be taken care of by next year. I promise.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDude. You know you\u2019ve been acting weird lately, right? It\u2019s like...Sometimes it feels like you know more than what you\u2019ve been telling us. Almost too much, really.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in any sort of trouble\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m really not. It\u2019s okay, Grover. I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\n\nPercy does not know what he\u2019s doing.\n\n\nThat could not be more obvious when he shows up at the rock he usually meets the naiads at, and Luke is there, waiting for him. He\u2019s staring. Probably because Percy\u2019s covered in his own blood.\n\n\nThe giant badgers are really mean, okay?\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Percy mumbles. He shoulders past Luke so that he can stand in the creek.\n\n\nLuke looks him up and down, his eyebrows raised.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s some intense training you\u2019re doing,\u201d he says.\n\n\nPercy sighs, shaking out his shoulders as his wounds heal. He wishes there was some way he could subtly retrieve Riptide from his pocket.\n\n\nLuke continues, \u201cYou miss being on a quest?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs that what it looks like?\u201d Percy asks. He isn\u2019t really sure what Luke wants from him right now. He knows Kronos isn\u2019t visiting Luke in his dreams anymore. If he was, Luke would\u2019ve been avoiding Percy the whole summer instead of annoying him, and Percy would probably be down one hand and up one pit scorpion sting already.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different, isn\u2019t it? Out there.\u201d Luke says. He\u2019s lounging just out of Percy\u2019s striking distance. \u201cThe real world is where the monsters are.\u201d\n\n\nPercy had thought that Luke might calm down a little without Kronos ruining his sleep. But, maybe the real crazy was inside Luke all along.\n\n\nSuddenly, so fast that Percy doesn\u2019t have time to react, Luke grabs his wrist and drags him out of the creek.\n\n\nShit!\n\n\nLuke squeezes hard, his face close to Percy\u2019s own. Percy goes for Riptide, and he lashes out again, seizing Percy\u2019s other arm before his hand can even brush his pocket.\n\n\nThis is bad! Why is Luke so strong?! Or is it Percy who\u2019s still too weak?\n\n\nPercy struggles wildly, panicking, before he remembers and lets himself go limp.\n\n\nThe creek is behind him. If Luke tries to kill Percy, Percy will kill him first.\n\n\nBut Luke doesn\u2019t try. Instead, he smiles and says, \u201cDid you feel it, Percy? The darkness gathering, the monsters growing stronger. The uselessness of all the heroics\u2014being our parents\u2019 pawns.\u201d\n\n\nHe searches Percy\u2019s face. Whatever he\u2019s looking for, he must find it, because he smiles.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been dreaming of him,\u201d Luke says, triumphant. \u201cLord Kronos.\u201d\n\n\nOh. So that\u2019s how it is. Percy can...Percy can work with this.\n\n\n\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t been,\u201d he taunts.\n\n\nLuke\u2019s grip tightens. \u201cSo it was you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you angry?\u201d Percy says. If he knees Luke in the crotch, will he be able to get away? Or will Luke actually murder him then? He can see Backbiter\u2019s hilt over his shoulder. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were a masochist.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI like being able to keep in touch with my allies.\u201d Luke frowns. Then he lets go of Percy. Maybe he sensed the imminent threat to his soft spot.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy immediately scrambles back into the water. He doesn\u2019t want to be seen with weirdly shaped bruises on his wrists. Rubbing the red handprints, he grumbles, \u201cYou mean you like to spend your nights kneeling to your master.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBetter to serve him than our parents,\u201d Luke retorts.\n\n\n\u201cBut still a servant.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a hypocrite, Percy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t serve Kronos,\u201d Percy says. \u201cI\u2019m just doing stuff for him.\u201d Sort of.\u00a0\n\n\nLuke smiles meanly, crossing his arms. \u201cLike failing to deliver the symbols of power to Tartarus.\u201d\n\n\nPercy crosses his arms back. \u201cI didn\u2019t fail. The plans just changed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d Luke sounds casual, but Percy spotted how his gaze just sharpened.\n\n\n\u201cStop fishing,\u201d Percy says. \u201cYou\u2019re bad at it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou would know, I suppose,\u201d Luke replies. \u201cBut, don\u2019t you think getting your \u2018stuff\u2019 done would be easier with two swords instead of one?\u201d\n\n\nNo. Especially if that other sword is Backbiter.\n\n\nLuke laughs. \u201cWhat\u2019s with that face?\u201d he says. \u201cHey, didn\u2019t I teach you how to fight? Come on, Percy. Do you really think you can oppose the gods alone?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo far, I\u2019ve been doing pretty good at learning from your mistakes,\u201d Percy says.\n\n\nLuke\u2019s smile stiffens.\u00a0\n\n\nHe sighs and then takes a step towards the creek, only stopping when Percy tenses, his hand in his pocket.\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Luke says, raising both his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you. I can\u2019t stand the idea of staying here for another year. Watching campers run around and beg for the chance to kill themselves over a second of their parents\u2019s attention, wasting my life working for the people who let Thalia die, training kids to serve their parents like fools and then get slaughtered by their own monsters\u2014I won't do this anymore. I can't. The gods are wrong, Percy, and they deserve to be taken down a peg. Or six hundred floors.\u201d\n\n\nLuke\u2019s not smiling anymore. He\u2019s gazing right into Percy\u2019s eyes.\n\n\n\u201cYou get it. You know why I have to leave.\u201d\n\n\nOh, Percy knows. Even without Kronos giving him orders in his sleep, Luke\u2019s still going to cause trouble if left alone at camp. Maybe he\u2019ll try to send another new kid to the Underworld as a delivery scapegoat for the Titans. Maybe he\u2019ll convince more campers that the only way to get back at their parents is to crown a meaner one. Maybe he\u2019ll find the entrance to the labyrinth and get himself possessed again before Percy\u2019s ready. Then Percy will have to drop everything to go personally kick him into Tartarus.\n\n\nNot that he wasn\u2019t planning to do that already.\n\n\nIt\u2019s too early. Even though Percy really, really wants to go and\u2014He shouldn\u2019t think about that. He can\u2019t think about that without wanting to do it, and it isn\u2019t safe yet. He\u2019s been trying not to rush into things for once.\u00a0\n\n\nPercy was hoping to stay at Camp Half-Blood for a little while. It\u2019s been nice. His friends are here. And he has plans. There\u2019s so much to do, and so little time.\n\n\nHe\u2019s already borrowed years, and it\u2019s still not enough.\n\n\nLuke presses his lips together. He looks frustrated, angry, full of potential that won\u2019t go anywhere but the grave.\u00a0\n\n\nBut, as the clouds above them shift, scattering sunlight into Luke\u2019s hair and across his cheekbones, Percy is suddenly reminded of that cool older guy who stole him a bunch of toiletries on his first day at camp. Percy\u2019s first swordfighting teacher. The guy who, for a second, made him feel like he belonged somewhere.\n\n\nThe hero of the prophecy. Another person who wanted so little and fell so far.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t let it...Don\u2019t let it happen again.\n\n\n\nDamn.\n\n\nThis is really happening, isn\u2019t it?\n\n\nPercy takes a deep breath.\n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t totally comfortable with leaving a budding military commander whose future crimes include trying to murder a bunch of teenagers at a summer camp for teenagers anyway.\n\n\nPercy sighs heavily. Then he takes his hand out of his pocket.\n\n\nLuke is still staring down at him. His eyes are clear and blue and burning.\n\n\nPercy says, \u201cDo you get seasick?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHello, is this Mrs. Jackson?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, this is Chiron, from Camp Halfblood. One of our counselors, Luke, escorted Percy back home this afternoon, but he has yet to return to camp. This is rather troubling, seeing as\u2014well. So I\u2018m calling to ask\u2014Is he perhaps staying with you and Percy for the night?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, there must be a mistake. I have the sign-up sheet right here. Percy clearly told us that he was\u2014\u201c\n\n\n\u201cOh. Oh, dear.\u201d\n"
