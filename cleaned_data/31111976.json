    "text": "Izuku was stressed. Really, really stressed. His finals were coming up, fast, and he was burying himself in studying for hours on end. The most social interaction he got was his friend\u2019s study group, where everyone was too tired to talk about anything but the content. He stayed up late re-reading textbooks then tossed and turned for an hour or two longer before finally drifting off, only to wake up at sunrise thanks to his stupid internal clock and paper-thin curtains. He was practically living in his one-size-too-big high school hoodie and That Pair of Sweatpants. \nBut that Sunday, five hours into his study binge for his upcoming calculus final, it became evident that his mother had had enough by the way she rapped on his door, then burst inside his room before he could mumble \u2018busy\u2019. \n\u201cIzuku, you need to take a break,\u201d she demanded, hands on her hips. Izuku frowned, twisting in his chair to face her. \n\u201cMom, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he assured, \u201cI-\u201d\n\u201cNo, honey, you are not,\u201d his mom pressed on, \u201cGo take a walk for at least an hour or two. You\u2019re doing yourself no favors locked up inside all the time!\u201d Izuku sighed, glancing back at his textbook and notes, and knowing this wasn\u2019t an argument he was going to win. Maybe she was right. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d he conceded, pushing himself out of his seat. \n\u201cThank you, sweetie,\u201d his mother smiled, then looked him up and down and made a bit of a face, \u201cChange your clothes before you do.\u201d Izuku nodded again and his mother gave him and affectionate pat on the cheek before sweeping out of the room. He shimmed his way out of his clothes, almost gagging at the smell. He might have been wearing this exact outfit for the whole week. Yeah, his mom was right \u2013 she usually was. \nHe tossed on a different hoodie and pair of basketball shorts, grabbing his phone and earbuds before leaving his room and starting to head out. As he passed Kouta\u2019s room, his little brother gawked at him with wide eyes and faked a dramatic gasp. \n\u201cIzu-nii! You\u2019re alive!\u201d he gasped, \u201cBut you\u2019ve become a cave troll!\u201d \nIzuku glared at the ten-year-old. \u201cSays the ugly little monster.\u201d \nKouta stuck his tongue out at him, a gesture Izuku returned before starting down the stairs. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Kouta called after him. \n\u201cMy cave!\u201d Izuku called back, \u201cI\u2019ll bring you a fancy rock if you\u2019re nice to me!\u201d \n\u201cYou suck!\u201d Kouta shouted.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not nice,\u201d Izuku muttered, opening the door, \u201cBye mom!\u201d \n\u201cBye honey!\u201d his mother called from the kitchen, blowing him a kiss. Izuku tried for a pleasant smile back. \nJust as he was about to close the door, Kouta yelled, \u201cI take it back please bring a rock I love you!\u201d \n\u201cLove you too, Kou!\u201d Izuku called before shutting the door with a more real smile. He stood out front of their house for a second, taking in a deep breath of fresh air he really hadn\u2019t been out in for far too long. This would be good. \nHe started down the sidewalk towards a road he liked to walk on, a windy one through a bit of urban woods in his city, putting his earbuds in his ears and pressing play on a playlist, letting the music and fresh air combine. He also did his best to focus on the music instead of letting his mind drift back to his schoolwork. He was missing time that he could be \u2013 no! Relax. \nIzuku had never been good at not thinking, but all he needed to do right now was think about anything else. Like\u2026All Might. Yeah, he could definitely think about All Might for a long time, the comic character he was nothing short of obsessed with \u2013 even his dream of being a doctor was kicked off his by his love for the hero, who\u2019s civilian persona was that of a kind Dr. Yagi Toshinori. He\u2019d first learned about All Might when he was a toddler, watching the TV show on weekends. Then he found about the comic book series, and the rest was a history.\nHe thought about All Might for a while longer, making his way into the urban woods area and briefly appreciating the nature around him. Early evening sunlight filtered through vivid green leaves and moss-covered concrete walls on the inside side of the road, leading up thick bushes and more trees. Izuku made a mental note to thank his mother later. This was a great idea. He was more relaxed, calmer, happier \u2013\nAnd then the car hit him. \nThe car that came around the corner Izuku had forgotten to walk on the far side of like his mother always told him to, not fast enough to kill him but fast enough to knock him off his feet, expelling all the air from his lungs with a wheeze on impact. He hit the ground like a sack of rocks, banging his head against the concrete and wiping the universe into black. \nFor a moment, all he could think over the intense ringing in his ears was \u2018ouch\u2019. And then \u2018oi\u2019. \nWait, no, his head voice isn\u2019t that deep. He\u2019d know, it\u2019s the voice in his head, after all, and it doesn\u2019t sound like that. He doesn\u2019t think. \nThe new not-his voice is also telling him to wake the fuck up, but he\u2019s not asleep, so that\u2019s silly. He cracks his eyes open with great effort and readies his mouth to say that, but all the comes out is \u201cUurgk.\u201d \nBut he was distracted from his embarrassing display of ineloquence when he came face to face with an angel. A beautiful angel with crimson red eyes like rubies and ash-blonde hair like fields of wheat \u2013 not that Izuku knows much about fields of wheat, he\u2019s lived in a city his whole life. \n\u201cOh, thank fuck, you\u2019re alive,\u201d the angel mutters, and Izuku thinks maybe he\u2019s not an angel because he didn\u2019t thank God. Maybe he\u2019s just a really pretty person on planet earth. Even better. \n\u201cHello, gorgeous,\u201d Izuku manages to slur, grinning like a drunk. Hm, didn\u2019t mean to say that out loud. \u201cI am pain,\u201d he tries again, wincing. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d the not-angel snaps, glaring at him. \n\u201cSorry,\u201d Izuku mumbles, clearing his throat and squeezing his eyes shut against the sunlight, \u201cI think I\u2019m concussed.\u201d His ears are still ringing, and he feels bile build in his throat, both symptoms of a concussion if he still remembers anything. \n\u201cShit,\u201d the not-angel curses \u2013 which isn\u2019t allowed for angels, now is it? \nLet it go, Izuku, he chides himself. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d he groans, trying to sit up. Which only brings more pain and makes him hiss. \n\u201cOkay, you need to stand up,\u201d the other boy orders. \n\u201cHelp?\u201d Izuku asks, squinting up at him and reaching out his arms. The boy huffs \u2013 which, rude, he\u2019s the one who hit Izuku with a car \u2013 but take his hand to pull him up and allow Izuku to sling an arm around his shoulders. Izuku suddenly feels incredibly dizzy and just about faceplants on the concrete again, but the boy holds him up and steadies him with an arm around his waist. He\u2019s a few inches shorter, Izuku notices, but a whole lot broader. \n\u201cYou\u2019re strong, pretty boy,\u201d he mumbles, then makes a strange hrrk noise as he attempts not to puke. \n\u201cWhat the fuck did you just say?\u201d the boy snaps, glaring at him menacingly. At least Izuku thinks that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing. His vision\u2019s a little blurry now. More concussion symptoms. \n\u201cSorry,\u201d he says again, feeling his cheeks heat at his utter lack of brain-to-mouth filter at the moment. \u201cNot the insult way,\u201d he clarifies, as if that\u2019s helping his case whatsoever. \u201cI think the\u2026I think I need to go to the hospital.\u201d \n\u201cNo shit, weirdo,\u201d the boy grumbles, tightening his grip on Izuku as he stumbles forward again. \u201cGet in the damn car.\u201d \n\u201cThe car you just hit me with?\u201d Izuku asks. \n\u201cJust get in,\u201d the boy orders, using his free hand to open the passenger car door and starting to move Izuku inside. Izuku complies, not totally sure if he should trust this stranger but too woozy and hurting to fight back. \n\u201cAm I being kidnapped?\u201d he does ask when he\u2019s sat in the passenger seat. \n\u201cNo, stupid,\u201d the boy answers, slamming the door shut in his face and moving around to the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to the hospital,\u201d he continues when he gets in. \n\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d Izuku mumbles, squinting his eyes almost shut and laying his head back against the seat rest. \u201cMy head hurts.\u201d \n\u201cStop whining, freckles,\u201d the boy snaps, starting the car. Freckles? Is that Izuku?\nIzuku huffs at him. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who hit me with your car, pretty boy.\u201d God, that just keeps slipping out, doesn\u2019t it?\nPretty boy glares at him again. \u201cStop calling me that.\u201d \n\u201cWhat\u2019s yer name then?\u201d Izuku slurs, tilting his head to face him but keeping it back on the headrest. The boy just sneers at him and starts driving, ignoring the question. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna sue you,\u201d Izuku promises. That would be petty and pointless, seeing as he probably only has a minor concussion his father\u2019s health insurance from work will cover. \n\u201cKatsuki,\u201d pretty boy finally answers. \nAnd for some reason, the first thing Izuku says is, \u201cKacchan.\u201d \n\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d Kacchan snaps. \n\u201cI got hit by a car,\u201d Izuku states, matter of fact, \u201cMy name\u2019s-\u201d he cuts himself off when another wave of nausea hits as the car turns around another corner, making him gargle strange noises through his name so the only intelligible syllable is \u201c-ku.\u201d \n\u201cDeku?\u201d Kacchan says, \u201cThat\u2019s suitable.\u201d \n\u201cHey!\u201d Izuku protests weakly, \u201cI said Izuku.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ll stick with Deku,\u201d Kacchan smirks. \n\u201cKacchan,\u201d Izuku mumbles back, closing his eyes fully and trying to take slow breaths to stop from puking. His head hurts like a bitch. \nKacchan evidently judges that he should let Izuku sit in silence for a bit, and neither of them say anything for a while. Izuku almost falls asleep until there\u2019s loud snapping in his face and Kacchan\u2019s saying, \u201cHey, freckles, stay awake.\u201d \nIzuku blinks his eyes open and groans, immediately shutting them again. Right, no sleeping with a concussion. \u201c\u2019m awake.\u201d\n\u201cGood, we\u2019re almost there,\u201d Kacchan responds. \n\u201cI should call my mom,\u201d Izuku realizes, feeling around his hoodie pocket for his phone. \n\u201cPut that away!\u201d Kacchan snaps, slapping the phone in his hand, \u201cYou can\u2019t look at a fucking screen if you\u2019re concussed, idiot.\u201d \n\u201cI know that,\u201d Izuku mutters in protest, \u201cbut I need to tell my mom a cute boy hit me with a car.\u201d \nKacchan stares at him for a second as they pull up to a red light, face flushed pink though Izuku\u2019s not sure why. All he said was he needed to call his mom. \u201cFine,\u201d Kacchan says, clearing his throat, \u201cI can help you call her when we get there.\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d Izuku agrees, \u201cno calling and driving, you might hit somebody.\u201d \n\u201cI wasn\u2019t fucking calling anyone!\u201d Kacchan practically yells, making Izuku wince as a slice of pain shoots through his head at the noise. Kacchan lowers his voice. \u201cCan you fucking let that go already?\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s been like ten minutes,\u201d Izuku mutters, \u201cI will not let it go. Not for a thousand years.\u201d \n\u201cYou are so fucking stupid,\u201d Kacchan grumbles, and all Izuku can do is nod weakly. \nSoon enough, the car stops moving, and Izuku opens his eyes to find them in the emergency room parking lot \u2013 a familiar sight thanks to his \u2018easily breakable bones and lack of human self-preservation skills most developed through evolution\u2019 (Uraraka Ochako, circa that time he broke his hand trying to do a flip off the monkey bars). Kacchan gets out of the car and Izuku tries to, but as soon as he stands, he has to lean on the car door for balance. \n\u201cHere,\u201d Kacchan offers, wrapping his arm back around Izuku\u2019s waist. Izuku drapes an arm across his shoulder, too much in pain to be that flustered but still hot-faced all the same. \n\u201cThanks,\u201d he mumbles, allowing Kacchan to help him hobble into the hospital and slump down in a chair. Kacchan goes off somewhere Izuku doesn\u2019t see, too busy staring intently at the weird pattern of the linoleum, and comes back with a staff member. \n\u201cHello,\u201d the woman smiles pleasantly. \n\u201cHeyo,\u201d Izuku slurs, massaging his temples before dropping his hands back to his lap, \u201cI hit my head real hard.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, I heard,\u201d the woman says, and Izuku smiles up at Kacchan, for some reason. And for some reason, Kacchan quickly averts his eyes. \u201cYou have a way to contact a parent, yes?\u201d \n\u201cMmhmm,\u201d Izuku hums, grabbing his phone from his pocket, \u201cI can call my mom, but I shouldn\u2019t look at a screen.\u201d He unlocks his phone with his thumbprint and holds his phone out to Kacchan. \u201cYou do it.\u201d \nKacchan huffs at him but takes his phone anyways, clicking on things then holding the phone up to his ear. \u201cHello?\u201d he says after a few moments, \u201cSorry, this isn\u2019t your kid. You\u2019re Izuku\u2019s mom though, right?\u201d Kacchan\u2019s eyes suddenly widen a bit. \u201cNo, he\u2019s fine!\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m fine mom!\u201d Izuku calls, making Kacchan glare and put the phone of speaker. \n\u201c-zuku! Are you in danger?\u201d his mothers voice wails from the other end, making him cringe in pain at its volume. \n\u201cI\u2019m okay, mom,\u201d he assures again, \u201cI just\u2026I hit my head and I\u2019m at the hospital now. Kacchan drove me.\u201d \n\u201cKacchan?\u201d his mother asks. \n\u201cMy name is Katsuki,\u201d Kacchan corrects, scowling. \n\u201cHe\u2019s nice,\u201d Izuku hums, slumping a bit in the chair. \n\u201cExcuse me, miss,\u201d the hospital staff member cuts in, \u201cmy name is Ishikawa, I\u2019m a nurse. I need your consent to help your son right now, and it would be great if you could come here.\u201d \n\u201cOf course!\u201d his mom says, \u201cYou have my consent to treat him however he needs, I\u2019ll be over as soon as I can!\u201d \n\u201cOkay, love you mom,\u201d Izuku mumbles, leaning towards the phone Kacchan\u2019s holding out towards him. \n\u201cLove you too, honey,\u201d she responds, \u201cSit tight! I\u2019ll be right over.\u201d With that, she hangs up, and Kacchan shuts off the phone and hands it back to Izuku to return to his pocket. \n\u201cAlright, hon,\u201d Ishikawa says, smiling down at him, \u201clet\u2019s get you into an exam room, unless you\u2019d rather wait for your mother?\u201d \n\u201cNo, we can go,\u201d Izuku says, pushing himself out of his seat and wobbling on his legs a bit. Both Kacchan and Ishikawa move to steady him, but he manages to stay up on his own this time. Kacchan pretends he wasn\u2019t about to help by shoving his hands deep in his pants pockets. \n\u201cBye then, Deku,\u201d Kacchan says.\nIzuku frowns. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to make sure I survive or something?\u201d He doesn\u2019t want to never see him again. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is gonna fucking kill you, freckles,\u201d Kacchan grumbles. Izuku chuckles a bit, thinking back to all the other times he\u2019s been in the hospital. He\u2019s definitely had worse than this. \n\u201cWell, it\u2019s your responsibility to make sure of that, pretty boy,\u201d he says, looking over to Ishikawa, who\u2019s watching them with interest. \u201cMa\u2019am, do you have a pen and paper I could borrow?\u201d \n\u201cSure,\u201d Ishikawa answers, pulling a little notepad and pen out of the pockets of her scrubs and handing them to him. He does his best to write down his name and number with his blurry vision, adding a little smiley face at the bottom of the paper for fun before tearing it off and holding it out to Kacchan. \n\u201cJust in case you want to make sure,\u201d he says, inwardly amazed at the smoothness of it all until he remembers he\u2019s still concussed and throws up in his mouth a little. Kacchan still snatches the paper out of his hands, though, so that\u2019s a win. \u201cThank you, miss,\u201d Izuku says, handing the notepad and pen back to an extremely amused Ishikawa. \n\u201cOf course,\u201d she smiles, \u201cfollow me.\u201d She starts towards a set of doors, and Izuku waves at Kacchan one last time before following her. As soon as they pass through the doors, Ishikawa snorts a bit and looks over at him. \u201cYou got game, kiddo.\u201d \n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve got is a concussion,\u201d Izuku responds. Ishikawa laughs. \n\u00a0\nA few hours later, Izuku\u2019s alone is his bedroom, all light turned off except his lamp. The doctor said his concussion was a relatively minor one, and that he should be fine with a bit of Tylenol and plenty of rest. But he wasn\u2019t allowed to do schoolwork, read, or even play video games. But he also wasn\u2019t supposed to just sit in a dark room with nothingness. So he\u2019s just bored, slumped in his bed and staring at the wall, music playing quietly from his phone to prevent total insanity. \nEventually, there\u2019s a light knock on his door and his mom peeks her head in. \u201cAll okay in here, honey?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m bored,\u201d Izuku groans. His mother laughs lightly and comes all the way inside, sitting on the edge of the bed. \n\u201cHow about you tell me what happened?\u201d she asks. He\u2019d been too in pain at the hospital to explain. \n\u201cI got hit by a car,\u201d he admits, making his mother\u2019s face transform to immediate shock. \u201cNot that bad!\u201d he assures quickly, \u201cI wasn\u2019t watching where I was going, and they came around the corner\u2026but they were going slow and didn\u2019t hit me hard at all. Like the doctor said, the concussion\u2019s only minor.\u201d \nHis mom frowns, eyebrows knit in concern. \u201cYes, thankfully. You\u2019ll have to be more careful in the future.\u201d \n\u201cI know, mom.\u201d \n\u201cWhat about that person you mentioned?\u201d his mom asks, \u201cThe one who took you to the hospital.\u201d \n\u201cKacchan?\u201d Izuku says, \u201cAh, yeah, he was kind of\u2026driving the car that hit me. But it wasn\u2019t his fault!\u201d His mom looks slightly taken aback, so Izuku jumps to the defense of the boy he barely knows. \u201cIt was just a mistake! And he was super nice, too, he drove me to the hospital and made sure I stayed awake and everything.\u201d \n\u201cIs this another teenager?\u201d\nIzuku thinks on that for a second. \u201cYeah, he looked about my age.\u201d \n\u201cWell,\u201d his mom says, \u201cI guess it could\u2019ve been worse for the both of you. I\u2019m glad he did the right thing by helping you, though.\u201d \n\u201cMe too,\u201d Izuku says a little wistfully, smiling to himself. This does not go unnoticed by his mother, who cocks up a brow in question. Izuku feels his face flush. \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\u201cWhat\u2019s this Kacchan look like?\u201d his mother asks with a slightly sly grin. Izuku blushes harder. \n\u201cI need to rest!\u201d he quickly blurts, pushing her off his bed as she laughs, \u201cBye mom!\u201d \nHis mom laughs a bit more and leans down to kiss his forehead. \u201cOkay, honey, I\u2019ll go. Glad you\u2019re okay, dinners in a little bit.\u201d \n\u201cThanks mom,\u201d Izuku says as she leaves, then slumps back into his pillows again. The room is back to soft music and nothing, then suddenly the music is interrupted by a small buzz from his phone. He picks it up, sure to turn down the brightness all the way, and checks his notifications.\n\u00a0\n\nUnknown Number\n\n&gt;&gt; this better be deku\n\u00a0\nIzuku grins at his phone screen and changes the new number\u2019s contact to kacchan (pretty boy). \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; kacchan!!!\n\u00a0\nThe response is immediate. \n&gt;&gt; why the fuck are you on your phone right now\n&lt;&lt; you texted me first pretty boy ;D\n\u00a0\nIzuku does not know how to flirt or make friends and he\u2019s pretty sure that\u2019s obvious, but here\u2019s the good news \u2013 he\u2019s already made one of the worst possible first impression, so they only way to go from here is up. He can\u2019t get worse, at least. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; also the doctor said I can use my phone as long as symptoms don\u2019t worsen\n&gt;&gt; what\u2019s the damage? \n&lt;&lt; I knew you cared! worry not, just a minor concussion and a few scrapes, nothing I haven\u2019t survived before\n&gt;&gt; shut up. \n&lt;&lt; rude :(\n&gt;&gt; god you\u2019re annoying\n&lt;&lt; you can\u2019t be mean to me after hitting me with your car it\u2019s not nice\n&gt;&gt; I can do whatever the fuck I want\n&lt;&lt; well apparently you want to talk to me cuz youre still here ;)\n&gt;&gt; cut it out with the winky face\n&lt;&lt; no ;))) \n&gt;&gt; goodbye.\n&lt;&lt; wait no don\u2019t leave!!!! pls I cant do anything else I\u2019m so bored\n\u00a0\nKacchan doesn\u2019t respond for a bit, and Izuku worries he really did leave. But then:\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; what do you mean \u2018nothing you haven\u2019t survived before\u2019?\n\u00a0\nIzuku grins again. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; well, not to brag, but I\u2019ve broken a grand total of nine bones throughout my lifetime\n&gt;&gt; how tf is that a brag, you sound like a dumbass with cracker bones\n&lt;&lt; I prefer \u2018laughs in the face of danger\u2019 but okay\n&gt;&gt; dumbass with weak cracker bones. \n&gt;&gt; how\u2019d you break them?\n&lt;&lt; uuuuuuhh monkey bar flip, fistfight with my friend (I didnt know how to punch right n broke my fingers), bike crash, fell out of a tree\u2026I cant remember the rest\n&gt;&gt; holy shit\n&gt;&gt; you\u2019re stupid. \n&lt;&lt; \u0295\u2022\u0361-\u2022\u0294\n&lt;&lt; well at least I don\u2019t hit people with my car, kacchan\n&gt;&gt; STOP BRINGING THAT UP\n&lt;&lt; NEVER!!! YOU DESERVE IT!!!\n&gt;&gt; fuck off\n&lt;&lt; no thanks I like talking to you :D \n\u00a0\nA few moments pass without any snarky response, but Izuku is determined not to let the conversation trail off, not when he\u2019s been engaging in witty banter with a cute boy \u2013 at least, he thinks that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; how old are you btw? not in the creepy way just wondering\n&gt;&gt; saying \u2018not in the creepy way\u2019 makes it creepy deku\n&lt;&lt; hm. true. okay, how old are you? full stop\n&gt;&gt; 17, you?\n&lt;&lt; same!! where do you go to school? Im at mustafa high\n&gt;&gt; yuuei academy\n\u00a0\nOf course, the hot guy goes to a prestigious private school. Yuuei\u2019s known for being exclusive, expensive, and pretty much a literal Hogwarts, castle on top of the hill and all. The students even live in dorms most of the time. Izuku\u2019s friend, Todoroki, was supposed to go there but refused because of teenage rebellion Izuku was wholeheartedly in support of. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; mmm youre fancy, I see\n&gt;&gt; shut up\n&lt;&lt; maybe I /should/ sue you for your riches\n&gt;&gt; do not. \n&lt;&lt; Im kidding!! \n&lt;&lt; what were you driving to or from today? \n&gt;&gt; going back from visiting parents for the weekend\n&lt;&lt; aw that\u2019s nice\n&gt;&gt; it is not\n\u00a0\nIzuku laughs out loud at that. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; what, you dont like your parents?\n&gt;&gt; my mom\u2019s a hag and she sucks, my dad is fine\n&lt;&lt; cant relate, my moms an angel on earth and my dad fucked off to europe\n&gt;&gt; yikes\n\u00a0\nIzuku snickers a bit. It\u2019s a better response than most people have. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; eh, we still get his money\n&lt;&lt; the monster in my family would be my lovely little brother\n&gt;&gt; gross, children. glad I don\u2019t have siblings\n&lt;&lt; youre an only child\u2026..it\u2019s all coming together\n&gt;&gt; what the fuck is that supposed to mean??\n&lt;&lt; it means im figuring you out, kacchan\n&gt;&gt; impossible. I\u2019m an enigma\n&lt;&lt; well I got time ;D\n&gt;&gt; put the winky face away, deku\n&lt;&lt; ;(\n&gt;&gt; what the fuck\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nKatsuki wakes up Monday morning to a text from Deku, AKA Cute Guy I Hit With My Car. It definitely puts a spin on the whole meet-cute trope when the first words you say to someone are \u2018please don\u2019t be dead\u2019 as their unconscious body lays on the concrete at your feet. Even weird when the first thing this suddenly very attractive strangers says to you is \u2018hello, gorgeous\u2019. And then calls you pretty a bunch of times. And gives you his number. \nSo, yeah, Katsuki sees the text from Deku and his stupid heart starts to flutter while he\u2019s trying to eat a bowl of cereal. Gross. \n\u00a0\n\ndeku\n\n&gt;&gt; I can\u2019t go to school today because of you &lt;(\uff40^\u00b4)&gt;\n&lt;&lt; what, you like school? \n&gt;&gt; I have finals!!!!!\n&lt;&lt; you can miss one day of school, deku\n&gt;&gt; yeah well you have to keep me entertained during it\n&lt;&lt; no, I still got fucking school to do\n&gt;&gt; reparations, kacchan, this is karma. I am going to annoy you aaaaallll day (\u00ac\u203f\u00ac)\n&lt;&lt; I\u2019ll block you\n&gt;&gt; you cant do that\n&lt;&lt; watch me\n&gt;&gt; wah\uff08\uff1b\u3078\uff1a\uff09\n\u00a0\nThat makes Katsuki actually snort out loud as he tries to stifle laughter so the other students in the dorm don\u2019t notice. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; waluigi??\n&gt;&gt; WHAT\n&gt;&gt; im wheezing\n&gt;&gt; who knew you were funny\n&lt;&lt; oh fuck you\n&gt;&gt; you see youre so good at entertaining me, im so glad im getting your undivided attention all day\n\u00a0\nThe worst part is that Katsuki actually wants to give it to him, which is a very weird feeling. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; never\n&gt;&gt; you wound me, kacchan\n&gt;&gt; emotionally /and/ physically\n&gt;&gt; because, you know\u2026\n&lt;&lt; shut up\n&gt;&gt; you hit me with your car\n&lt;&lt; I hate you\n&gt;&gt; okay pretty boy\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s that fucking nickname again. Who the hell calls someone \u2018pretty boy\u2019? All Katsuki can think of when he reads it now is Deku\u2019s slightly drunken (read; concussed) smile, sparkling green eyes locked softly on Katsuki, all those stupid freckles scattered everywhere across his face \u2013 and his legs, Katsuki noticed with the basketball shorts.\n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; I said stop calling me that\n&gt;&gt; okay gorgeous \n\u00a0\nHoly fucking shit. Katsuki\u2019s going to die. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; seriously?\n&gt;&gt; handsome man? stunning guy? lovely lad?\n&lt;&lt; what the hell\n&gt;&gt; wheat hair\n&lt;&lt; huh??\n&gt;&gt; nvm that last one\n&lt;&lt; fuckin weirdo\n&gt;&gt; glad we\u2019re on the same page\n&lt;&lt; and what fucking page would that be, deku? \n\u00a0\nThe three dots appear for a second, then disappear, then reappear a moment later. \n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; 420\n\u00a0\nKatsuki resists the urge to bang his head into the table. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; fuck you \n&gt;&gt; Im so glad I got to meet such a wonderful, kind person\n&lt;&lt; sarcastic little shit\n&gt;&gt; :P\n\u00a0\n\u201cYo, Bakubro!\u201d a familiar voice calls from across the common room, and Katsuki glances up to find Kirishima grinning at him with Mina on his heels. \u201cGood morning!\u201d \nKatsuki just nods at him, looking at the time. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; I gotta go\n&gt;&gt; aw man (\uff61\u2022\u0301\ufe3f\u2022\u0300\uff61)\n&gt;&gt; talk to you later I guess!! pretty boy ;D\n\u00a0\nKatsuki shuts his phone off before his face turns beet red, shoving it deep inside his pants pocket and starting to clean his breakfast dishes. \n\u201cWere ya texting someone?\u201d Mina chirps as she and Kirishima approach. \n\u201cNone of your business, Bubblegum,\u201d Katsuki snaps, putting his bowl in the dishwasher of the communal kitchen and going to grab his backpack from the floor by the table. \n\u201cYou were!\u201d Mina gasps, \u201cWho? A new friend? A special friend?\u201d \n\u201cI said it\u2019s none of your damn business,\u201d Katsuki repeats, glaring at both of their grinning faces, \u201cStop being nosy shits.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re your friends, Bakugou,\u201d Kirishima says, \u201cIt\u2019s our job!\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d \n\u00a0\nDeku leaves him alone nearly all the way through his first class of the day, where the buzz from his backpack has his attention divided for a full seven minutes until the class ends, providing a short five-minute break until the next teacher comes. \n\u00a0\n\ndeku\n\n&gt;&gt; mac n cheese at 9:30am, yes or no?\n&gt;&gt; kacchan\n&gt;&gt; kacchan hello\n&lt;&lt; no.\n&gt;&gt; :( why not?\n&lt;&lt; gross. why would you do that?\n&gt;&gt; my brother made mac n cheese last night and there are leftovers, I cant let them go to waste!!\n&lt;&lt; so eat them at literally any time after 12pm\n&gt;&gt; but consider. I am Hungry\n&lt;&lt; there are other foods you dumbass\n&gt;&gt; [deku attached an image]\n&gt;&gt; I do what I want Kacchan\n\u00a0\nKatsuki opens the photo to find an adorable shit staring back at him, smug smirk plastered across his freckled face, bowl of mac n cheese held up under his chin. His dark green curls are as wild and unkempt as they had been the day before, pushed back off his forehead like he\u2019d run his hand through it seconds before, revealing a small, rectangular bandage across his left temple. Other than that, there was no sign of injury that he could find, and Katsuki wishes that were the only reason he stared at the picture for so long. \nFuck. \n\u00a0\nDeku texts him a few more times throughout the first half of the day, mostly about inane things like mac n cheese for breakfast (no), whether or not he can or should climb the tree in his neighbor\u2019s front yard right now (definitely no), or the fact that he was taller than three out of four of the teenage mutant ninja turtles (why does he know that or even think to look it up). \nBy the time lunch break rolls around, Katsuki\u2019s at a breaking point, having stared at the single selfie far too long far too many times. He stomps up to the picnic table he and his friends have commandeered every day so far, slamming his bento box down on the table with enough force that even Kaminari shuts up and gives him attention. \n\u201cIs it morally reprehensible to ask out a guy you hit with your car?\u201d he blurts as all four of them just stare at him. \nAfter a long pause of silence, Kaminari says, \u201cIs he cute?\u201d \n\u201cDuh,\u201d Katsuki answers, thinking back to all those stupid freckles and smiles. Then he thinks about \u2018pretty boy\u2019. \u201cAnd possibly interested.\u201d \n\u201cThen I say go for it!\u201d Kaminari grins. \u201cYou only live once or whatever!\u201d \nKatsuki stares at him for a moment, then huffs and sits in his spot next to Sero. His friends all stay silent. \u201cWhat?\u201d he snaps, glaring. \n\u201cWait, dude, was that a hypothetical or are you serious?\u201d Kirishima asks. \nKatsuki scowls at him. \u201cHow or why the hell would I make that shit up?\u201d \n\u201cWhat,\u201d Mina gasps, amber eyes widening. \n\u201cYou hit someone with your car?\u201d Kirishima says, concerned. \n\u201cYou hit someone cute with your car?\u201d Mina squeals over him, making her priorities clear. \n\u201cExplain,\u201d Sero demands. \nKatsuki growls under his breath, but he\u2019s been friends with these idiots long enough to know they won\u2019t be letting this go. \u201cI was driving home from my parent\u2019s house yesterday I hit this boy at like fifteen miles an hour, and he got a concussion, so I took him to the hospital.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026nice of you,\u201d Sero tries, making Katsuki glare at him. \n\u201cI\u2019m not doing a fucking hit and run!\u201d he snaps. \n\u201cTell me about the part where you think he\u2019s cute,\u201d Mina urges, grinning. Katsuki turns his glare to her instead, feeling his cheeks heat dramatically. \n\u201cThe fuck is there to tell?\u201d \n\u201cWhat\u2019s he look like?\u201d Kaminari asks, \u201cDid you get his number?\u201d \n\u201cHe looks stupid, and he gave me his number,\u201d Katsuki admits, refusing to look any of them in the eye. He elbows Sero when he snickers. \n\u201cHe gave you his number?\u201d Mina repeats, clapping her hands together excitedly, \u201cOh my God! Was that who you were talking to this morning?\u201d \n\u201cBakubro\u2019s got a crush~,\u201d Kaminari smirks like an idiot, lucky he\u2019s got a Sero between him and Katsuki\u2019s fist. \u201cHe looks stupid, you say!\u201d \n\u201cDo you have a picture?\u201d Mina asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s his name? Is he into guys?\u201d\n\u201cFuck off, none of your business, and\u2026I think so,\u201d Katsuki answers in quick succession. \n\u201cWhat makes you think so?\u201d Kirishima grins. \nKatsuki\u2019s traitorous face heats dramatically when he thinks about that. \u201cReasons.\u201d \n\u201cCome on, man!\u201d Sero laments, \u201cYou gotta give us more than that!\u201d \n\u201cYour face is pink,\u201d Kirishima points out, making Katsuki growl at him, \u201cThis guy must be something!\u201d \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Kaminari agrees, \u201conly time I saw Bakugou blush was when Hawks winked at him.\u201d That reminder made Katsuki want to throw his entire self into the nearest trash can and toss Kaminari off a cliff. His short period of interest of in the popular upperclassman Keigo Takami \u2013 who went by Hawks, for some reason \u2013 back in first year was a period of his life he\u2019d gladly have wiped from the collective memory of everyone who knew. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d Katsuki threatens to absolutely no one\u2019s disturbance. \n\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to steal your phone if you don\u2019t give us more info on this mystery boy,\u201d Mina threatens back, grinning. Katsuki glares at her, putting a hand on top of his backpack protectively only to feel a buzzing from inside. He frowns, opening his bag and pulling out his phone to find that someone is indeed calling him. When he flips his phone over to see who, he nearly drops it before shooting to his feet.\nWhy the fuck is Deku calling him? \n\u201cDude?\u201d a few friends ask, but Katsuki ignores them, clicking the button to accept the call and holding the phone up to his ear, willing his heart to slow down. It\u2019s just a fucking phone call. \n\u201cDeku?\u201d he asks after a second of silence. \n\u201cHello, gorgeous,\u201d Deku responds coolly, and Katsuki once again almost drops his phone. This fucking loser, what the FUCK. Who gave him the damn right to eat mac n cheese at 9:30 in the morning, think about comparative heights of ninja turtles, say dumb things like \u2018I already have a concussion how much worse can it get\u2019, and yet be so fucking charming for no damn reason. \n\u201cWho\u2019s Deku?\u201d Sero asks. \n\u201cThe hell do you want, dumbass,\u201d Katsuki snaps into the phone, ignoring his friends. \n\u201cWell, I\u2019m ninety-percent sure you\u2019re on lunch break right now, and talking on the phone is easier for my concussion that texting!\u201d Deku explains. He has a nice voice, is that a thing people usually notice?\n\u201cAnd why do you need to talk to me at all?\u201d Katsuki asks, not really complaining. \nDeku sighs dramatically into the receiver. \u201cHave you forgotten what you owe me, Kacchan? I\u2019m bored!?\u201d \n\u201cI could literally hang up on you at any second,\u201d Katsuki threatens, more to remind himself than Deku. He does not like the feeling of liking someone like this. \n\u201cDo it, pretty boy,\u201d Deku shoots back, and Katsuki swears he hears a smirk. Also, hearing him say that again is so much worse than reading it in a text. \n\u201cI hate you, you know that?\u201d \n\u201cSo you claim,\u201d Deku says pleasantly, \u201cI sure don\u2019t hate you! I think you\u2019re great!\u201d For some reason, that straight-shot compliment makes Katsuki blush harder than the weird flirty shit, and he quickly grabs his stuff and heads a few feet away from his friend\u2019s table, sitting on the grass when he\u2019s just out of earshot. \n\u201cAnd backing down from a challenge is not something I\u2019m familiar with!\u201d Deku continued in his ear as he did so. \nKatsuki blinks a few times at nothing. \u201cDid you just quote All Might at me?\u201d \n\u201cYou know All Might?\u201d Deku gasps.\n\u201cUh\u2026yeah,\u201d Katsuki answers, not sure how much he knows about All Might to divulge. He\u2019s been into the hero since he was a brat and has a sizable collection of the comics on his bookshelf back at home. Kirishima called him a nerd one time and he punched him for it, but he made a bit of a point. \n\u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d Deku chirps into the phone, \u201cI love All Might! Do you read the comics? So far, I\u2019ve got one-hundred and seventy-eight in total.\u2019\u2019\nOh, Deku\u2019s definitely a nerd. The discovery makes Katsuki smile, but he\u2019s not sure why. \n\u201cFucking nerd,\u201d he says, \u201cYeah, I read the comics.\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Deku practically squeals, his excitement making Katsuki\u2019s heart flutter annoyingly, \u201cI am never going to shut up about this now! Who\u2019s your favorite character?\u201d\n\u201cAll Might,\u201d Katsuki answers immediately, making Deku laugh. Shit, he has a nice laugh. Agh. \n\u201cSame here, obviously!\u201d Deku laughs again, \u201cBut I meant other characters! Like Nighteye!\u201d \n\u201cAll the other characters suck.\u201d \nThey talk for a little while longer about All Might, by far the nerdiest conversation Katsuki\u2019s ever enjoyed having, but at one point Katsuki hears Deku groan in pain and tells him to go take a nap. Deku, of course, complains about this, but Katsuki\u2019s not going to responsible for more of his injury, so he hangs up despite his desire to keep talking. \nThe second he puts his phone down, his friends are on him like a pack of cackling hyenas. At least they waited. \n\u201cWas that him?\u201d Mina squeals, plopping herself down in the grass beside him. \n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Katsuki answers, opening his untouched bento box. \n\u201cIt totally was!\u201d Kaminari exclaims, \u201cHis name is Deku?\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s a weird name,\u201d Sero muses. \n\u201cDon\u2019t be mean,\u201d Kirishima chides.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe he called you!\u201d Mina says, \u201cAnd you answered!\u201d \n\u201cWhat did you talk about?\u201d Kirishima asks. \n\u201cUgh, you fuckers are annoying,\u201d Katsuki grumbles, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your damn business.\u201d \n\u201cBakubro, we\u2019ve been over this,\u201d Kirishima says in his classic imitation of the group mother, \u201cSharing is caring.\u201d \n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t apply here,\u201d Katsuki grumbles, but all his friends have already started chanting \u2018sharing is caring\u2019 anyways. Assholes. A few years ago, he would\u2019ve just stormed off, but these idiots must have turned him soft because he relents, just a bit. \u201cFine!\u201d he snaps, \u201cI will show you one fucking picture and then you will all shut the hell up!\u201d \nHis friends cheer like toddlers as he grabs his phone back out of his bag, only to open yet another text from Deku.\n\u00a0\n\ndeku\n\n&gt;&gt; I can\u2019t believe you hung up on me kacchan \u0ca0\u256d\u256e\u0ca0\n&lt;&lt; get off your fucking phone dumbass\n&gt;&gt; I would argue but my brain is trying to escape its skeletal confines, so fine\n\u00a0\nKatsuki huffs at this absolute idiot he is admittedly interested in, then scrolls back through their conversations until he gets to the picture, opens it up, and turns the screen around to show his friends. \nMina gasps immediately, ever the dramatic. \u201cHe is cute!\u201d \n\u201cDamn, Bakubro,\u201d Kaminari agrees with a smirk, \u201cI\u2019d hit that too.\u201d He and Mina crack up laughing at the horrible pun, and while Katsuki is distracted glaring at them Sero snatches his phone out of his hand. \n\u201cHey!\u201d \n\u201cOoh, you\u2019re right,\u201d Sero grins, though Katsuki\u2019s not sure who he\u2019s responding to. \nKirishima leans over Sero\u2019s shoulder and gets a matching shitty grin. \u201cHe looks nice!\u201d\n\u201cGive me back my damn phone before I kill you,\u201d Katsuki threatens. \n\u201cWhat,\u201d Sero deadpans, not looking up from the phone, \u201cyou gonna hit me with your car?\u201d Katsuki growls, about to tackle him and steal his phone back, but then Sero\u2019s eyes widen, and he clicks something. Uh oh. \u201cHe texted you again!\u201d \n\u201cGive it!\u201d Katsuki yells, lunging at him. \nSer leans as far away from Katsuki as he can, holding the phone up and out of reach while looking at it. \u201cOh my God, does that say Kacchan?\u201d\nKatsuki knees Sero in the chest, making him wheeze, and snatches his phone back. \u201cFuck off!\u201d \n\u201cHe calls you Kacchan?\u201d Sero says with a shit-eating grin. Katsuki scowls at him menacingly, then looks to his phone. \n\u00a0\n\ndeku\n\n&gt;&gt; kacchan is it possible to overdose on tylenol\n&gt;&gt; asking for a friend\n&lt;&lt; what the hell deku why are you still on your phone\n&gt;&gt; I am going to take a nap I swear!! I just wanted to take some meds before I do and Im wondering if I could chug this entire bottle\n&lt;&lt; do not do that\n&gt;&gt; ur no fun\n&lt;&lt; just go the fuck to sleep\n&gt;&gt; Im touched by your concern pretty boy ;D\n&lt;&lt; never mind you can die\n&gt;&gt; then youd be a murderer so HA\n&lt;&lt; I am not starting a conversation with you, go to sleep, goodbye\n&gt;&gt; fiiiiiinnne\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he saying, Kacchan?\u201d Kaminari teases, and Katsuki snaps his head up to glare at him. \n\u201cGo die,\u201d he growls.\n\u201cYou gonna ask him out?\u201d Kirishima asks, \u201cThat\u2019s what you asked earlier right?\u201d Katsuki just huffs at him in silence. In all truth, he\u2019s never asked someone out before, or had anything like a relationship. The only crush (ew) he\u2019s ever had was on Hawks (double ew), and that went nowhere, obviously and thankfully. \n\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t ask him out soon, I\u2019m going to,\u201d Mina grins. \n\u201cNot if I do first!\u201d Kaminari says. \n\u201cBetter get a move on, Bakubro,\u201d Sero smirks, \u201cYou\u2019ve got competition.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, like those idiots are competition,\u201d Katsuki grumbles.\n\u201cYou should just ask him on a date!\u201d Kirishima encourages, \u201cBe manly!\u201d \n\u201cNo,\u201d Katsuki says, suddenly stupidly nervous about the prospect of interacting with Deku one-on-one, face-to-face, in a date situation. He\u2019d never done anything like that before and he hates fucking up \u2013 and really doesn\u2019t want to fuck this up specifically \u2013 so he\u2019s going to have to do\u2026something to prepare for that. He\u2019ll figure it out. \n\u201cOoh, I know!\u201d Mina gasps. \u201cInvite him to Tuesday!\u201d she suggests, referring to \u2018Tuesday\u2019, their friend group tradition of going out to food or arcades and shit every Tuesday after school when they\u2019re allowed off campus for a few hours. \n\u201cYeah!\u201d Kirishima agrees, \u201cCasual thing!\u201d \nKatsuki scowls and ignores them, but he knows they know that means he\u2019s considering it. He hates to admit it, but they make a fair point. The other idiots could provide an awkwardness buffer\u2026the question was if that would outweigh introducing Deku to his friends. \n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nIzuku definitely has a crush. He has become one hundred percent smitten with the rude pretty boy that claims to hate him yet continues to indulge in conversations with him. He\u2019s pretty sure said pretty boy knows this \u2013 or at least he should have suspicions by now \u2013 and Izuku\u2019s decided the lack of outright rejection is a good sign. But he\u2019s still too much of a coward to do anything but flirt, if his seven deleted message drafts trying to ask Kacchan on a date or just to hang out in person are anything to go by.\nHe needs help, which is why the next day at school, he rushes to the spot out front where his friends often meet up in the mornings to chat. \n\u201c\u2019Zuku, you\u2019re here!\u201d Ochako calls, smiling and waving him over to where she stands with Tsuyu, Todoroki, and Iida. \n\u201cHello, Midorya,\u201d Todoroki greets. \n\u201cHey guys!\u201d Izuku chirps, adjusting his backpack strap over his shoulder. \n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you in good health today!\u201d Iida says. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tusyu agrees, \u201cWhat happened? You just said you weren\u2019t feeling well.\u201d \n\u201cAh, yeah, well,\u201d Izuku starts nervously, \u201cFigured it\u2019d be easier to explain in person.\u201d \n\u201cSo something did happen?\u201d Ochako asks, tilting her head a bit. \n\u201cUh, I got hit by a car,\u201d Izuku tells them, eliciting a few shocked expressions. \n\u201cOh my God!\u201d Ochako gasps, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d \n\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m fine!\u201d Izuku assures, \u201cJust a minor concussion, which is why I missed class yesterday!\u201d \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Tusyu asks, brows knit in concern. \n\u201cI was on a walk and I walked on the wrong side of the road, then a car came around the corner and\u2026\u201d Izuku bumps his fists together to mime the crash, shrugging a bit. \u201cIt knocked me over and I hit my head, but it really was fine!\u201d He smiles, cheeks warm. \u201cThe guy in the car took me to the hospital and everything.\u201d \n\u201cWhat\u2019s with that face?\u201d Ochako asks, narrowing her eyes at him. \nIzuku smiles wider, resisting the urge to cover his face with his hands. \u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d Ochako raises an eyebrow, not believing him for a second, and Izuku snickers nervously, rubbing a hand over the back of his neck. \u201cI made a fool of myself is all.\u201d \n\u201cHow so?\u201d Todoroki asks, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem too beat up about it.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, well,\u201d Izuku starts with another nervous, under-his-breath laugh, \u201capparently I\u2019m flirtatious when I\u2019m concussed.\u201d \n\u201cIzuku,\u201d Ochako says, raising both her brows now, \u201cDid you flirt with the guy who hit you with his car?\u201d \nIzuku purses his lips, holding back more laughter \u2013 his natural response to nerves \u2013 then smiles awkwardly. \u201cMaybe.\u201d \nOchako barks a laugh. \u201cOh my God! What?\u201d \n\u201cHe\u2019s really cute!\u201d Izuku wails, face burning, \u201cI thought he was an angel or something for a second.\u201d Ochako laughs again, along with Tsuyu and a smirking Todoroki. \u201cThe first thing I said was \u2018hello gorgeous\u2019,\u201d Izuku admits, \u201cand I gave him my number.\u201d \n\u201cDamn, who knew you had it in you?\u201d Ochako cackles, and Izuku elbows her lightly in the shoulder. \n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I can be plenty confident when I want to be!\u201d he protests. \u201cIn fact, I have flirted with him when not totally concussed!\u201d \n\u201cWait, you\u2019re still talking with him?\u201d Tsuyu asks. \n\u201cYeah, I gave him my number and he texted me,\u201d Izuku says. \n\u201cDoes he go to school here?\u201d Iida asks, pushing his glasses up his nose. \n\u201cNope, he goes to Yuuei,\u201d Izuku answers, and he can practically see Ochako\u2019s eyes turn into cartoon dollar signs. \n\u201cHoly shit, you could sue him!\u201d she exclaims, \u201cOr, no, even better \u2013 marry him for his money.\u201d \n\u201cOchako!\u201d Izuku chides, face burning again, \u201cI\u2019ve known him for two days!\u201d \n\u201cSugar daddy,\u201d she grins. \n\u201cWe\u2019re seventeen,\u201d Todoroki deadpans. \nOchako waves her hand at him, unbothered. \u201cFine, sugar friend or whatever, just get that rich boy cash.\u201d \n\u201cI am not interested in his money,\u201d Izuku clarified, making Ochako roll her eyes. \n\u201cBut you are interested,\u201d she says, smirking. Izuku\u2019s face flushes again. \n\u201cYes,\u201d he admits, \u201cWhich is why I am in need of help. Please.\u201d \n\u201cWhat, to ask him out?\u201d Tsuyu clarifies, \u201cJust ask him.\u201d \n\u201cYou make it sound so easy,\u201d Izuku pouts at her, \u201cIt is not!\u201d \n\u201cSure it is, \u2018Zuku!\u201d Ochako grins, slinging an arm around his midriff because she can\u2019t really reach his shoulders, \u201cJust say \u2018hey there, rich boy, you should date me so my best friend can reap the benefits of your wealth\u2019!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say that,\u201d Izuku laughs. \nOchako shoots him a mock glare. \u201cBoo.\u201d \n\u201cHow about suggesting he go to coffee with you?\u201d Iida offers. \nIzuku thinks about that for a second. \u201cMaybe\u2026honestly, I\u2019ve never been on a date before, so that\u2019s a little scary.\u201d He laughs nervously again. \u201cWho would want to spend that much one-on-one time with me, you-\u201d He cuts himself off with an exclamation of pain when Ochako punches him square in the arm. \u201cOw!\u201d \n\u201cNone of that, Izuku!\u201d she chides, \u201cYou\u2019re wonderful and a great person to be around!\u201d \n\u201cThanks, but did you have to hit me that hard,\u201d he bemoans, rubbing his arm. Ochako knows three kinds of martial arts and getting hit by her makes that very obvious. She\u2019s the one who taught him to punch after he broke his fingers in a fight with Todoroki \u2013 it was complicated. \nThere\u2019s a sudden buzz from him back pocket, and he pulls it out to check, unable to stop a grin when he sees Kacchan\u2019s name pop up on his screen. \n\u201cOoh, is that him?\u201d Ochako asks. \n\u201cYeah, one second,\u201d Izuku answers, opening the message. \n\u00a0\n\nkacchan (pretty boy)\n\n&gt;&gt; hey my friends are going to a diner after school today want to come with? \n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s heart jumps in his chest and he smiles wider. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s he say?\u201d Tsuyu asks. \n\u201cHe\u2019s inviting me to go to a diner with his friends,\u201d Izuku says. \n\u201cSay yes!\u201d Ochako exclaims. \n\u201cI was going to,\u201d Izuku laughs, though he hadn\u2019t really been sure. \n\u201cI want to come with,\u201d Ochako adds, \u201cmeet Mr. Money for myself.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ll ask,\u201d Izuku concedes, starting to type his response. It would be really nice to have Ochako there if he was going into cool-rich-kid land. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; sure!!! can I bring a friend?\n&gt;&gt; okay\n&gt;&gt; you can meet us on sakura a block down from yuuei at 4\n&lt;&lt; cool!!! (\uff89^\u2207^)\uff89see you then pretty boy ;D\n&gt;&gt; youre uninvited \n&lt;&lt; too late :P\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo?\u201d Ochako asks, making him look up, \u201cYou\u2019re awfully smiley.\u201d \nHe blushes again. \u201cUh, he said you could come.\u201d \n\u201cAwesome, someone else is paying.\u201d \n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s leg bounces with nervous energy all through the school day, and by the time it\u2019s over he\u2019s having regrets. But Ochako\u2019s having none of that and drags him to the bus stop, chatting excitedly about some event they\u2019re holding at her karate studio that weekend. Izuku relaxes as he talks with her, but the nerves creep back in as they near their stop. \n\u201cThis one\u2019s Sakura!\u201d Ochako chirps when the bus comes to a stop, grabbing his hand to pull him out of the bus. \n\u201cAaah Ochako this is scary,\u201d he bemoans, following her onto the street. \n\u201cThis is nothing, \u2018Zuku! Just some new people, no problem,\u201d she grins. \u201cBesides,\u201d she continues, nudging him with her elbow, \u201cyou got me!\u201d \nIzuku smiles at her, grateful again for his best friend, then starts looking around. Down the block, he spots a group of high schoolers, a head of spiky blonde hair in a group of four others. \u201cI think that\u2019s them,\u201d he says, squinting at the bright red and pink haired people beside possibly-Kacchan. \n\u201cLet\u2019s go then!\u201d Ochako chirps, starting down the sidewalk. Izuku quickly follows after, taking a deep breath to push down his nerves and mustering up a smile. \n\u201cKacchan!\u201d he calls, making the blonde turn around to reveal that he\u2019s guessed correctly. He grins wider. \u201cHey there, gorgeous!\u201d Ochako glances back at him with wide eyes and an opened-mouth, surprised and amused grin, but he\u2019s got no explanation. It\u2019s just a habit now or something. \n\u201cFucking took you long enough,\u201d Kacchan says when he gets closer, crossing his strong arms over his broad chest. Wow, he\u2019s buff. \n\u201cPublic transit,\u201d Izuku says by way of explanation. \u201cThis is Uraraka Ochako, by the way!\u201d He gestures to Ochako at his side, who\u2019s watching Kacchan the same way she watches and opponent before a fight. Then, she breaks into a grin. \n\u201cHiya, rich boy!\u201d \nIzuku stifles a sigh and Kacchan glares at her. \u201cHi.\u201d He turns his attention back to Izuku. \u201cThese are a bunch of idiots.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s us!\u201d the boy with red hair grins, \u201cI\u2019m Kirishima, nice to meet you!\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re Deku, right?\u201d a yellow-eyed boy next to Kirishima asks, \u201cI\u2019m Kaminari.\u201d \nIzuku laughs, looking over at Kacchan. \u201cYou told them my name was Deku?\u201d \n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell them anything,\u201d Kacchan corrects, looking disgruntled. \n\u201cWait, that\u2019s not your name?\u201d Kaminari asks, raising an eyebrow. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Izuku chuckles, \u201cIt\u2019s Midoriya Izuku, Kacchan\u2019s just mean.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ll take it your real name\u2019s not Kacchan?\u201d Ochako asks Kacchan. \n\u201cBakugou,\u201d Kacchan provides, \u201cDeku\u2019s just an idiot.\u201d \n\u201cI was concussed, which was your fault, so I wouldn\u2019t be so mean,\u201d Izuku protests, then smirks down at Kacchan, \u201cpretty boy.\u201d \nKacchan glares at him, but his cheeks flush pink, so Izuku takes it as a win. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d \n\u201cYou see, you keep saying that,\u201d Izuku says, titling his head back and forth, \u201cbut you also keep talking to me. Is this a guilt thing?\u201d He smiles wider. \u201c\u2019Cause if not, it seems like you just like me.\u201d \n\u201cIf I do, it\u2019s against my better judgment,\u201d Kacchan shoots back. Izuku snorts a laugh and turns back to Kacchan\u2019s other friends. \n\u201cIs he always like this or is it just for me?\u201d \nThe tallest boy with a black mullet grins. \u201cDepends. I\u2019m Sero, by the way.\u201d \n\u201cAnd I\u2019m Ashido,\u201d the girl with a bright pink afro adds, leaning forward a bit and flicking her eyes between Izuku and Ochako, \u201cbut you two can call me Mina,\u201d she finishes with a wink. Izuku glances over at Ochako, who\u2019s cheeks are pinker than usual. He nudges her lightly in the shoulder, making her startle a bit. \n\u201cYou can call me Ochako!\u201d she blurts, and Izuku tries not to grin too wide. \n\u201cAlright!\u201d Kirishima says, clapping his hands together and gaining the group\u2019s attention, \u201cNow that we\u2019re all introduced, let\u2019s get a table.\u201d\nThe seven teenagers head inside, Ochako mouthing a silent \u2018thank you\u2019 to Izuku as they do. \u201cAre there any tables big enough?\u201d he asks when they get inside the little diner. \n\u201cOh, I got this,\u201d Ochako cuts in before anyone else can answer. \u201cHostess!\u201d she calls, making the blonde woman behind the counter look up, \u201cCan I move some tables around?\u201d \n\u201cSure, hon,\u201d the hostess responds. \n\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am!\u201d Ochako smiles sweetly at her, then swiftly picks up a two-person table with one hand and a chair with the other, most definitely showing off. She effortlessly moves the heavy furniture up against a booth table, then presents one of the seats with an unnecessary flourish of her hand, grinning at Mina. \u201cM\u2019lady.\u201d \nIzuku stifles a bit of laughter, but looking over to a blushing Mina shows that it definitely did work. \n\u201cWhat the fuck was that,\u201d Kacchan whispers next to him as people start to take their seats. \n\u201cFlirting, I think,\u201d Izuku whispers back. He slides into one side of the booth next to Sero and Kaminari, leaving one chair left at the table, right next to him. \u201cGuess you\u2019re stuck next to me, pretty boy,\u201d he says, grinning up at Kacchan, who huffs and plops into the seat. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with pretty boy?\u201d Kaminari asks, and Izuku glances around to find all of Kacchan\u2019s friends watching them, looking extremely amused. Ochako winks at him from next to Mina, then smirks, her way of being encouraging. \n\u201cI, uh,\u201d Izuku starts, face burning, then gestures loosely towards Kacchan, \u201cI was concussed and he looks like that.\u201d He mentally face-palms at his strange way of phrasing things. \n\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d Kacchan says, though he\u2019s not snapping, just asking, one eyebrow cocked up. \nIzuku lets out a huffed laugh. \u201cWhat, you want to hear it all out loud now?\u201d \n\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t call me wheat hair again,\u201d Kacchan shrugs. Izuku laughs, louder this time. \n\u201cI think that was fitting,\u201d he says, reaching out to brush his fingers lightly through Kacchan\u2019s hair. \nKacchan makes a face and slaps his hand away. \u201cWho said you could give me nicknames anyways?\u201d \n\u201cYou hit me with your car,\u201d Izuku counters. \n\u201cStop using that as leverage!\u201d \n\u201cI already said I wouldn\u2019t let it go for another thousand years, Kacchan,\u201d Izuku reminds him, \u201cYou deserve it. Besides, you gave me a nickname too.\u201d\n\u201cOne that\u2019s also fitting,\u201d Kacchan responds. \nIzuku places his hand over his heart for dramatic effect. \u201cDo you enjoy hurting me?\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d Kacchan deadpans. \n\u201cWell,\u201d Izuku grins, \u201cI\u2019ll quote that to the jury when I charge you with assault. You did it on purpose.\u201d \nKacchan keeps glaring at him, but smirks the tiniest bit. Izuku likes that that\u2019s the way he smiles, and he wants to make him do it all the way. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll finish the job if you ever text me about mac n cheese before noon again.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know, that mac n cheese was delicious, and your negativity only made it that much better.\u201d \n\u201cHow long have you two known each other again?\u201d Kirishima cuts in, and Izuku startles a bit at the reminder that other people have been there all along. \n\u201cUh\u2026three days?\u201d he answers. Only three days? It feels like he\u2019s known Kacchan for longer, but he guessed all the things he said at their first meeting sort of tore down all the initial walls pretty fast. \n\u201cHello, everyone!\u201d a woman in an apron chirps, approaching their table, \u201cWelcome to Ryuko\u2019s Diner, are you ready to order or do you need a few minutes?\u201d \n\u201cWe can order!\u201d Kirishima answers, equally cheerful as Izuku quickly scans one of the menus on the table that he\u2019d been ignoring. He makes his choice just before the woman asks him, but when he looks up and finds Kacchan watching him he can\u2019t help himself. \n\u201cHey, is there any chance you have mac n-\u201d he can\u2019t even make it through the sentence without laughing or slapped across the face by Kacchan, which only makes him laugh harder. \u201cI\u2019m kidding!\u201d he giggles, punching Kacchan lightly in the shoulder. \nHe gives the waitress his actual order, then starts getting to know Kacchan\u2019s friends. They seem fun, and Mina is definitely flirting with Ochako, who Izuku can tell is doing her darndest to not dissolve into a puddle. He knows he\u2019s going to never hear the end of this later, but he doesn\u2019t mind that much because a) it\u2019ll make his friend happy and b) she\u2019ll stop whining about wanting a girlfriend so often. \nKacchan\u2019s other friends are nice too, especially Kirishima, who seems to be the embodiment of sunshine. Sero is funny and his mullet is cool, and Kaminari also cracked a few puns Izuku laughed at. \nAll in all, Izuku feels like he had nothing to worry about after all. He even learns some things about Kacchan through his friends, like the fact that the only blemish on his record is a detention he got in the beginning of first year for accidentally knocking over a vase of flowers on a teacher\u2019s desk then screaming at her about it (\u201cWho fucking puts a vase on the corner of their desk?\u201d). \nBy the time the bill comes around, it\u2019s been a few hours, and Izuku feels like he might have made even more new friends. \n\u201cThis was really fun!\u201d he exclaims as they leave the diner into the slight chill of the early evening. He smiles at Kacchan at his side. \u201cThanks for inviting me, Kacchan.\u201d \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Kacchan says, shoving his hands in the pockets of his Yuuei jacket. Izuku wonders if he does that when he\u2019s nervous, or if he\u2019s just overthinking things. What he is sure of is that Kacchan truly looks gorgeous right now, hair ruffling in the bit of breeze and sharp eyes brightened nicely by the low sun on the horizon. \n\u201cGuess I\u2019ll catch you later, pretty boy,\u201d he says, trying for the coolness he mustered before, but it comes out closer to wistful or breathy. Oops. \n\u201cSure thing, freckles,\u201d Kacchan responds. \nIzuku can\u2019t help a comfortable smile and that, cheeks warming, the diverts his attention to Ochako, who\u2019s still chatting away with Mina as the taller, pink-haired girl leans back against the wall of the diner. \u201cOchako!\u201d he calls, \u201cHate to interrupt, but we got a bus to catch.\u201d \nOchako frowns back at him, but all he can do is shrug an apology. She says something along the lines of \u2018talk to you later\u2019 to Mina, then joins him as they walk back down the road to the bus stop. \n\u201cSo,\u201d Izuku begins, grinning. \n\u201cOh my God, \u2018Zuku,\u201d Ochako blurts, raking a hand through her short brown hair, \u201cHoly shit. She\u2019s-I mean, wow. Wow.\u201d \nIzuku snickers. \u201cNow who\u2019s got a crush?\u201d \n\u201cDid you see her, \u2018Zuku?\u201d Ochako exclaims, throwing her hands up, \u201cGoddess among mortals, I swear. I\u2019m so glad rich boy hit you with a car.\u201d \n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re getting something out of that after all.\u201d \n\u00a0\nLater that evening, as Izuku\u2019s trying to do some homework without getting too much of a headache, his phone buzzes with a text from Kacchan. \n\u00a0\n\nkacchan (pretty boy)\n\n&gt;&gt; mina will not shut up about your friend can you pass her number over or something \n&lt;&lt; lmao ochako wont stop talking about her either, ill ask\n\u00a0\nHe sends a quick text to Ochako, then returns to his chat with Kacchan. \n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; I swear to god if I have to hear \u2018she could crush me and I\u2019d thank her\u2019 one more time I\u2019m committing a crime\n&lt;&lt; you mean another crime? cus, you know, hitting someone with a car\n&gt;&gt; shut the fuck up\n&lt;&lt; not technically legal kacchan\n\u00a0\nJust then, a response from Ochako comes in: \u2018YES YES YES I OWE U MY LIFE\u2019. He smiles, then send her number to Kacchan. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; that\u2019s ochako, please do pass it along\n&gt;&gt; that\u2019s the plan. \n&gt;&gt; what are you up to right now?\n&lt;&lt; aw does pretty boy like talking to me (\u00b4\ua4b3`)\n&gt;&gt; never mind\n&lt;&lt; wait no don\u2019t leave I\u2019ll stop\n&lt;&lt; im just doing hw, what about you?\n&gt;&gt; same\n&lt;&lt; im also trying to study for finals but for some reason my head really hurts when I focus for too long\n&gt;&gt; weird. wonder why\n&lt;&lt; yeah it\u2019s quite the mystery\u2026..\n&lt;&lt; in all seriousness tho, finals got me stressed (\uff61\u014f\ufe4f\u014f)\n&gt;&gt; just chill then\n&lt;&lt; wow kacchan can\u2019t believe I never thought of that before thanks\n&gt;&gt; oh fuck off, I\u2019m betting you\u2019ve been studying like hell, you\u2019ll be fine\n&lt;&lt; how did you know?\uff08\u30fb\u25a1\u30fb\uff1b\uff09\n&gt;&gt; youre a fucking nerd\n&lt;&lt; why cus I like all might? hate to break it to ya kacchan but you like all might too\n&gt;&gt; are you calling me a nerd?\n&lt;&lt; hmmm\u2026yes definitely :)\n&gt;&gt; well fuck you then\n&lt;&lt; what do you have against nerds kacchan?? (your own kind)\n&gt;&gt; you\u2019re one of them (fuck off)\n&lt;&lt; do you know any other insults\n&gt;&gt; I don\u2019t need them\n&lt;&lt; well youre gonna have to do better than fuck off to get rid of me, pretty boy ;D\n&gt;&gt; so I\u2019ve gathered\n\u00a0\nIzuku waits as the three dots appear, then disappear, then appear again. Huh, he didn\u2019t peg Kacchan as one to second guess himself. Finally, a message comes through. \n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; guess I\u2019m fine with you sticking around then. you\u2019re not too bad or whatever\n\u00a0\nIzuku grins like an idiot, laying his head back to stare at the ceiling for a moment, running a hand over his face and through his hair. That was the lowest bar for a compliment he\u2019s ever received but it was from Kacchan, so now he\u2019s all flustered in his empty bedroom. He\u2019s got no right to judge Ochako. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; aww thanks kacchan \u208d\u055e\u25cc\u2032\u1d55\u2035\u0942\u25cc\u208e\u2661\n&lt;&lt; youre not too bad yourself\n&gt;&gt; I\u2019m fucking great. gotta go now\n&lt;&lt; bye!! \n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nKatsuki must\u2019ve stared at the wall behind his desk for a full minute before standing up, walking over to his bed, shoving his burning face into a pillow, and groaning like a teapot about to boil over. What the fuck. What the fucking fuck. Why is he like this. \n\u201cUh, dude?\u201d Kirishima, who happens to be his roommate as well as his friend, asks from the other side of their room. \u201cYou good?\u201d \n\u201cNo,\u201d Katsuki says into the pillow, the sits up and bonks his forehead against the wall for good measure. Maybe he\u2019s the concussed one. \u201cI hate him.\u201d \n\u201cWho?\u201d Kirishima frowns. \n\u201cHim,\u201d Katsuki repeats like it made any sense the first time, slumping down into his bed and staring at the ceiling. \nKirishima is quiet for a second, then, \u201cDeku?\u201d Katsuki grabs the pillow from beside him and shoves it over his face again, which makes Kirishima laugh. \n\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Katsuki grumbles into the pillow. \n\u201cCome on, man, what did he do?\u201d Kirishima laughs, \u201cHe seems really nice.\u201d \n\u201cHe\u2019s a fucking monster,\u201d Katsuki says, taking the pillow off his face again. An adorable monster that won\u2019t stop being a dastardly level of flirty yet completely kind and pure at the same time. \u201cHe cursed me.\u201d That\u2019s the only reason one tiny heart in a text message would ever have Bakugou Katsuki getting too flustered to continue a conversation.\n\u201cPretty sure you just have a crush on him,\u201d Kirishima counters. Katsuki scowls at the ceiling. He didn\u2019t know crushes felt like this. With Hawks, it was just objective attraction and whole lot of regret. He didn\u2019t ever feel the desire to talk to him or think about him when he didn\u2019t see him. \u201cI think you should just ask him out already,\u201d Kirishima continues when Katsuki doesn\u2019t respond, \u201cI mean, he\u2019s clearly into you, and, I love you guys, but I can\u2019t take this from both you and Mina at the same time.\u201d \nLike she\u2019s a she-devil and her name is a summoning spell, Mina herself flings their door open that exact second, squealing as she throws herself on top of Katsuki. \u201cAgh!\u201d he wheezes and shoves her off, making her fall to the floor but not stop grinning. \u201cWhat the fuck do you want?\u201d \n\u201cTo thank you,\u201d Mina grins from the floor, \u201cYour fuck-up got me a date!\u201d \n\u201cWait, seriously?\u201d Kirishima asks. \n\u201cYup!\u201d Mina squeals, pumping her fist, \u201cI\u2019m going on a date with a hot girl and it\u2019s all thanks to you, Blasty. And my charming personality.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Katsuki deadpans. \n\u201cCan you tell him how you did that so he can stop pining,\u201d Kirishima says. Katsuki launches a pillow at his face, which he bats away as he laughs. \u201cCome on, Bakubro, you\u2019re pining.\u201d \n\u201cFuck you,\u201d Katsuki snaps, \u201cI\u2019m not pining.\u201d \n\u201cAnd denial\u2019s just a river in Egypt,\u201d Mina smirks, putting her hands over her face to block another pillow projectile. She sits up. \u201cYou know, he obviously likes you.\u201d \nKatsuki just scowls at the wall and doesn\u2019t answer. He\u2019s known Deku for a matter of days and he\u2019s been acting like that the whole time, how is Katsuki supposed to know whether or not that\u2019s just his personality. \u201cHe might just be like that,\u201d Katsuki voices. His friends stare at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\u201cDude,\u201d Kirishima admonishes, \u201che wasn\u2019t calling me pretty boy.\u201d \n\u201cOr gorgeous,\u201d Mina adds. \n\u201cOr Kacchan,\u201d Kirishima continues. \n\u201cKacchan~,\u201d Mina coos, making a kissy face and staring longingly into the distance. She\u2019s lucky Katsuki is out of pillows now. \n\u201cGet out my fucking room,\u201d he says instead. Mina just laughs, the cocky asshole. \n\u201cYou know what, fine,\u201d Kirishima says, pointing at him, \u201cYou\u2019re just scared, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \n\u201cWHAT,\u201d Katsuki yells, shooting to his feet, \u201cI am not fucking scared!\u201d \n\u201cOoh,\u201d Mina tsks, sucking on her teeth and faking a wince, \u201cthat sounds like even more denial, Blasty.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s okay be nervous, bro!\u201d Kirishima chirps with an innocent grin. \n\u201cSCREW YOU,\u201d Katsuki shouts, grabbing one the pillows from the ground before freezing. Wait. Fuck, he\u2019s falling for things again. These fucking assholes he called his friends were egging him on, and it was fucking working, because he\u2019s not a fucking coward. He\u2019s not. \nSo, yeah, he\u2019s taking the bait. He\u2019s mature enough to admit that. \nNot mature enough to stop himself from slamming the pillow into Kirishima\u2019s face anyways, though. \n\u201cI know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he huffs, plopping back down on his bed. The two of them have the gall to feign innocent looks. \n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Mina says, placing a hand over her heart in mock offense. \n\u201cYou know,\u201d Katsuki counters, glaring at her, then gets back on his feet and stomps over to his desk, grabbing his phone, \u201cBut I am not scared of some shit nerd.\u201d \nThe fucking idiots start cheering. He flips them off over his shoulder. \n\u00a0\n\ndeku\n\n&lt;&lt; hey are you free friday night?\n&gt;&gt; you weren\u2019t gone long! yeah I should be free then, whats up?\n&lt;&lt; give me your address I\u2019m picking you up at 5\n\u00a0\nKatsuki hits send the second he types the whole thing out - not because he\u2019s worried he\u2019ll chicken out, thank you very much. He\u2019s just impatient. Except then Deku doesn\u2019t answer. For a full ten seconds there\u2019s nothing, then he\u2019s typing, then nothing again, and holy fuck Katsuki is going to pass out if he keeps this up. Why, Deku. Why. \n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; ok\n\u00a0\nThank fuck. But Deku\u2019s not done. \n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; looking forward to whatever you have planned and hoping its not murder!!! ( \u02ca\u1d55\u02cb )\u2661\n\u00a0\nHoly fucking shit, another heart thing. Katsuki disgusts himself. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; give me your address freckles\n&gt;&gt; see that sounds like a threat pretty boy\n&lt;&lt; it is.\n&gt;&gt; ( \u2686 _ \u2686 ) oh\n\u00a0\nHe sends his address, and Katsuki shuts his phone off and stares at his desk. Holy fuck he just did that. And Deku said yes! Holy shit! Holy fucking shit! \n\u201cFuck yeah,\u201d he breathes out loud, resisting the urge to pump his fist like an idiot. \n\u201cSo?\u201d Kirishima asks from behind, startling him so much he drops his phone with a clatter to his desk. Kirishima snorts, and Katsuki whips around to glare at him. \n\u201cDid he say yes?\u201d Mina says, eyes wide and excited. \n\u201cOf course he did,\u201d Katsuki snaps, trying to keep his voice level, \u201cNow leave me the fuck alone.\u201d \nHe\u2019s got three days to figure out how the hell to take a cute boy on a date that\u2019ll blow his fucking mind. \n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nHalfway across the city, Izuku shoves his face into a pillow and screams, causing great concern for Ochako, who he was in the middle of a phone call with when Kacchan texted. He tells her what happened, to which her only comment is the serendipity of them both getting a date at nearly the exact same time. And that makes Izuku start to wonder if this is a date.\nOh boy. \nPanic mode. \n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nEarly Friday evening, Katsuki pulls up in front of an old beige house with a lush front garden, rhododendron bushes peppered into small green hedge bushes that line a path up to the front door. He does a once over of himself in the mirror before getting out of the car just because, making sure the eyeliner Mina forced on him isn\u2019t fucked up \u2013 of course, it\u2019s not, because Mina is a makeup goddess, something he\u2019ll admit wholeheartedly because he\u2019s not an asshole all the time. \nThough, he did start to lose patience when she insisted on \u2018checking\u2019 his outfit, because apparently being the son of two award-winning fashion designers isn\u2019t enough confirmation that he knows what the fuck he\u2019s doing. Aji Fry t-shirt, ripped jeans, and his trusty combat boots. He\u2019s good to go. \nHe forces himself to digest the fucking butterflies in his stomach as he makes his way up to the front door, pressing the doorbell button and shoving his hands in his pockets to stop from fidgeting. He thinks he\u2019s relaxed until, suddenly, the ring of the doorbell elicits a shriek from inside the house, followed by an unknown voice yelling \u201cHE\u2019S HERE!\u201d. What the fuck? \n\u201cKOUTA I SWEAR TO GOD-\u201d comes Deku\u2019s muffled yelling from somewhere inside, but he\u2019s cut off by the door flying open. Katsuki stares down in mild shock at a miniature version of Deku, minus all the stupid freckles and with darker hair. \n\u201cHi!\u201d the kid practically yells at him, grinning, \u201cYou\u2019re Kacchan, right?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026Katsuki,\u201d Katsuki answers, not sure how to interact with who he\u2019s pretty sure is the previously mentioned monstrous little brother. \nThere\u2019s loud thumping from inside, like someone\u2019s running down the stairs, then Deku suddenly appears behind the kid and drags him backwards, cutting off his excited, \u201cIzu-nii won\u2019t shut up about-\u201d\n\u201cHello!\u201d Deku yells over his little brother, shoving the kid behind him and glaring at him. \u201cBye Kouta.\u201d The last thing Katsuki sees before Deku slams the door shut is Kouta sticking his tongue out. Deku whirls around, one hand still on the door handle and the other running through his unruly forest hair, grinning when his eyes meet Katsuki\u2019s. \u201cHey gorgeous!\u201d \n\nFuck, he\u2019s beautiful.\n\n\u201cSorry about him,\u201d Deku continues while Katsuki\u2019s busy having a crisis over him literally doing nothing. He\u2019s not even all that dressed up \u2013 for fuck\u2019s sake, he\u2019s wearing an All Might themed graphic tee and another pair of basketball shorts, Mustafa High lanyard hanging out of one of the pockets. Though, one notable thing is the scars on his right arm, something Katsuki hadn\u2019t seen before because he\u2019d always been wearing long sleeves. He thinks back to Deku\u2019s nine broken bones. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said, he\u2019s a little monster.\u201d \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Katsuki responds dumbly, zoning back into the conversation to find Deku staring at him, freckled cheeks flushed a little darker. He\u2019d be lying if he said that didn\u2019t make him preen a little, straightening up a bit from his usual slouch. \u201cWhat?\u201d \nDeku blinks a few times, like he just noticed where he was, then the effortlessly suave grin returns \u2013 effortlessly because Katsuki\u2019s ninety percent sure he actually doesn\u2019t do it on purpose, or at least doesn\u2019t know the fucking effect it has on him (he admits begrudgingly). \u201cNothing, you just look nice.\u201d \nKatsuki appreciates the bluntness and honesty in a general sense, but holy fuck he\u2019s supposed to be being cool right now. \u201cThanks,\u201d he manages, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d \n\u201cRight!\u201d Deku chirps, pulling his keys out of his pocket to reveal \u2013 of fucking course \u2013 an All Might keychain hanging off the end of the school lanyard, next to a slightly more surprising Mirko keychain. He locks the door and shove the keys back in his pocket, once again letting the lanyard hang out. \n\u201cMirko?\u201d Katsuki asks as the walk back down to his car, a little interested because he likes that hero too. \nDeku grins wider. \u201cYou noticed! Yeah, she\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d he says, \u201cBy the way, my mom\u2019s out right now but she wants to meet you later.\u201d \nKatsuki frowns, that idea making him nervous for stupid reasons. \u201cWhy?\u201d \n\u201cBecause,\u201d Deku laughs, \u201cyou hit me with your car.\u201d \nKatsuki almost blanches, freezing halfway to walking around to the car door. Maybe he has not-stupid reasons to be nervous. \u201cYou told her that?\u201d \n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Deku assures, also stopping, \u201cshe also knows you helped me out. She\u2019s not trying to yell at you or anything.\u201d He chuckles a bit. \u201cNo need to be scared of my mother, Kacchan. Unless you\u2019re rude to service workers or something.\u201d \n\u201cWho said I was fucking scared?\u201d Kacchan snaps, unlocking the car and making his way over to the driver\u2019s seat. Deku laughs again as he gets into the passenger side.\n\u201cJust in case you were, pretty boy,\u201d he smiles, \u201cWhere are we off to?\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019ll find out,\u201d Katsuki answers, starting the car. He honestly doesn\u2019t have much of a plan, as he somehow let Mina coerce him into the idea that something like this should have \u2018an element of spontaneity!\u2019. If things go south, he\u2019s blaming her first and foremost. \n\u201cOoh, a surprise,\u201d Deku says as Katsuki pulls into the street, \u201cOkay, I like surprises. Just make sure it doesn\u2019t involve running over any innocent strangers.\u201d \nKatsuki glares at him. \u201cI\u2019m gonna punch you.\u201d \n\u201cEyes on the road, Kacchan,\u201d Deku retorts, smirking. \u201cDoes your radio work?\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Katsuki answers, but Deku\u2019s already pressing random buttons on his dash. He slaps his hand. \u201cOi, get yer grubby hands away from that.\u201d \n\u201cKacchan,\u201d Deku pouts at him. \n\u201cMy car,\u201d Katsuki argues, turning on the radio anyways. A song he doesn\u2019t recognize croons through the speakers, but apparently Deku does because his sea green eyes blow wide with a grin. \n\u201cI love this one!\u201d he chirps, reaching out to turn up the volume despite what Katsuki just said. And then the worst fucking thing happens \u2013 he starts singing along. Why is this the worst fucking thing? Because holy shit, if Katsuki thought he had a nice voice when he was talking, his singing has him gripping the steering wheel so hard he might just crush it. \nHe\u2019s glad the place they\u2019re going isn\u2019t too far from Deku\u2019s house, because the mere two songs Deku gets through are enough to drive him to the edge of insanity, heart pounding to the beat of \u2018you\u2019re a gay loser\u2019 in his chest. \n\nDigest the fucking butterflies, Katsuki.\n\nHe shuts off the radio the second he parks, making Deku open his eyes and pout at him. \u201cAw.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d he counters, turning the car off. Deku turns to look out the window. \n\u201cOh my gosh!\u201d he gasps, opening the car door, \u201cIt\u2019s the place!\u201d \nKatsuki does an inner fist pump as he follows Deku to the front of the little restaurant. Nailed it. \n\u201cNerd,\u201d he says aloud, smirking. \nDeku rolls his eyes at him. \u201cKacchan, you\u2019re the one who picked this place, and you obviously know what I\u2019m talking about, so you\u2019re my nerd equal right now.\u201d \n\u201cOh, fuck off,\u201d Katsuki says, opening the door to the restaurant, one featured in the 209th issue of All Might comics, a real-life place the author and illustrator loved to frequent and decided to give a cameo. In the comic, All Might stopped by for udon after fighting that week\u2019s villains. Katsuki had placed his bets that Deku of all people would remember this, and he did. Once again: nailed it. \nThey take their seats at one of the tables, greeting the server behind the counter, and Deku launches into a ramble about the specific history of this restaurant \u2013 or the fictional version of it, at least \u2013 in the All Might comic series, because apparently it was there more than once. As in it was drawn in the background. What a fucking nerd. \nHe only pauses from the ramble to order their food, then jumps right back into it. \nKatsuki\u2019s completely fine with just zoning out on his dumb, cute, animated face while he talks about the nerd shit, though, so there\u2019s no complaints from him. He has no idea what Deku\u2019s talking about by the time he gets a look of realization in his eyes and snaps his mouth shut. \n\u201cOh God, I\u2019m boring you, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he says.\nKatsuki blinks at him a few times, drawing his mind away from it\u2019s weird obsessing over the beauty mark on the outer corner of Deku\u2019s eye. \u201cHuh? Oh-sure, whatever.\u201d \nDeku frowns at him a bit, raising an eyebrow. \u201cWere you listening to anything I just said?\u201d \n\u201cNot since before we ordered,\u201d Katsuki admits without shame, taking a bite of his spicy curry. \nDeku, thankfully, just snorts, apparently not insulted. \u201cSo what, you\u2019ve just been staring at me, pretty boy?\u201d \n\u201cPretty much,\u201d Katsuki confirms, forcing himself to not be a coward and meet Deku\u2019s eyes despite his burning cheeks. Deku doesn\u2019t seem to have expected that answer, and his mild shock and lack of a quip in response somehow emboldens Katsuki. \u201cYou\u2019re cute when you talk about nerd shit.\u201d \nDeku\u2019s eyes widen further at that, but he recovers quickly with a clearing of his throat and the stupid grin again. \u201cThanks, you\u2019re cute all the time.\u201d \n\u201cJust one of many things I\u2019m better at,\u201d Katsuki manages to counter, making Deku laugh. \n\u201cNice, Kacchan.\u201d He leans forward a bit. \u201cAnyways, sorry for the bad manners. How was your day?\u201d \nThey have an actual conversation for the rest of the meal, talking about dumb things that would usually bore Katsuki to death but Deku somehow makes interesting. Or maybe it\u2019s just his face. Either way, Katsuki\u2019s enjoying himself and definitely doesn\u2019t want to take Deku back home after they\u2019re done eating. \n\u201cWe can just walk around,\u201d he suggests when Deku asks as they leave the restaurant. \n\u201cSure!\u201d Deku grins, hugging himself and rubbing a hand over his bare arm, like he\u2019s trying to warm himself up. The action doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by Katsuki, who mostly runs warm and isn\u2019t much affected by the chilling air as the sun sinks on the horizon. \n\u201cOne sec,\u201d he says, unlocking his car and grabbing a spare hoodie from the backseat. \u201cHere.\u201d He tosses the thing to Deku, who catches it with a slight look of surprise, then just holds it like and idiot. \u201cPut it on if you\u2019re cold, dumbass.\u201d \n\u201cOh,\u201d Deku says, looking flustered like before, \u201cThank you!\u201d He slips the hoodie on, and it fits despite their height difference. Katsuki feels himself start to blush at the sight of Deku, grinning, wearing his clothes, hands shoved into the pocket, so he quickly starts walking down the sidewalk. \u201cYou know,\u201d Deku says as he catches up to Katsuki\u2019s side, \u201cyou\u2019re pretty nice under all the swearing.\u201d \n\u201cYou take that back,\u201d Katsuki deadpans. Deku laughs again. Making Deku laugh is great. \n\u201cSorry, sorry, I\u2019ll ruin your reputation,\u201d he says. \nThey pick up their conversation where they left off after that, a comfortable back and forth as they walk down the road. At some point, Katsuki considers trying to hold Deku\u2019s hand, but even without having to work up to courage to do that Deku\u2019s busy waving his hands about while he talks or keeping them shoved in the hoodie pocket. So that\u2019s a no-go, which sucks. \nEventually, they come up on a soccer field behind what Katsuki assumes to be Mustafa High, and Deku trails off, eyes brightening a bit. \n\u201cHey, Kacchan, watch this!\u201d he chirps, then takes off running before Katsuki has time to say anything, performing a cartwheel in the middle of the field and landing with his hands high in the air, blinding grin spread across his face. What an idiot. \n\u201cWhat are you, five?\u201d Katsuki says, walking towards him. \nDeku laughs and drops his arms back to his sides. \u201cIt\u2019s fun! My gymnast friend taught me.\u201d \nKatsuki tries to remember the name of the round-faced girl Deku brought to the diner with him. \u201cUraraka?\u201d\n\u201cNo, a different friend,\u201d Deku answers, \u201cHer name\u2019s Tsuyu! Ochako does martial arts, she taught me to throw a punch.\u201d \nKatsuki silently wonders how strong Deku actually is despite his relatively thinner frame. \u201cYou know how to fight?\u201d \n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Deku smirks, bringing up his fists in not-too terrible form, \u201cI could totally take you.\u201d \nKatsuki cocks and eyebrow and doesn\u2019t resist a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m not fighting you out here, Deku, and not with your fucking concussion.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re no fun,\u201d Deku pouts. \n\u201cFor the record, I\u2019d pummel you,\u201d Katsuki counters for the sake of his own pride. \n\u201cWould you now?\u201d Deku says, \u201cProve it.\u201d Then, with a speed Katsuki didn\u2019t know he had, he bolted towards Katsuki and hooked him around the waist, lifting his feet off the ground. \n\u201cOI!\u201d Katsuki yells, grabbing Deku\u2019s shoulders instinctively to stop himself from falling backwards. \u201cWhat the fuck, shit nerd?\u201d \nDeku grins up at him. \u201cSee, I can be strong!\u201d \n\u201cPut me down,\u201d Katsuki growls, face burning. Deku, thankfully, listens and drops him back to the ground. \n\u201cYou\u2019re heavy,\u201d he winces, shaking out his arms a bit. \n\u201cThought you said you were strong,\u201d Katsuki retorts, brushing his shirt flat again. Then, he glances up at Deku with an idea. \n\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re-AH!\u201d Deku cuts himself off with a yell as Katsuki gives him a taste of his own medicine. Except Katsuki miscalculated, not taking Deku\u2019s apparent fear of heights into account because when he lifts him, Deku grabs onto him like he\u2019s a lifeline in a storm, wrapping his legs around Katsuki\u2019s waist and latching onto him like a koala. \u201cKacchan!\u201d he yelps, right next to Katsuki\u2019s ear. \n\u201cSee how it feels?\u201d Katsuki manages. Deku huffs and leans back, keeping his hands on Katsuki\u2019s shoulders, making his skin feel tingly at the touch. Then Deku smiles at him. Shit. \n\u201cOkay, fine, you\u2019re stronger,\u201d Deku concedes. \u201cBut,\u201d he continues, shoving his face towards Katsuki\u2019s so suddenly Katsuki jolts back in a panic, sending his balance off-kilter and cutting off whatever Deku was trying to say as they both go toppling to the grass. \u201cAH!\u201d \n\u201cFuck,\u201d Katsuki wheezes on impact, Deku landing heavily on top of him and knocking the air out of his lungs for a second. He shoves the other boy off of him with a groan, reaching out to cradle the back of his head at the last second. He still doesn\u2019t want to responsible for worsening Deku\u2019s condition, though he wants to yell at him right now. \n\u201cAck, are you okay?\u201d Deku worries, sitting up. \n\u201cOf course I am,\u201d Katsuki groans, keeping his eyes shut, \u201cNo thanks to your ass crushing me.\u201d \nDeku, that bastard, has the gall to laugh again. Fuck him and his pretty laugh. \u201cSorry about that, glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d Katsuki answers with another grumble, opening his eyes to find Deku laying back beside him again. \n\u201cHow about your head?\u201d \nDeku smiles, rolling on his side to meet Katsuki\u2019s eyes. \u201cAll good, thanks for making sure.\u201d \n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Katsuki grumbles with a warm face. He averts his eyes to the sun-seeped sky above them, taking deep breathes to sooth the pain in his back from the fall. That could\u2019ve gone better. But whatever, it\u2019s passed now. \nHe takes one more deep breath in the fresh evening air, and he\u2019s glad he does because the second he turns his head to face Deku again he forgets how to breathe at all. His sparkling green eyes are soft, smile relaxed as he just lays there and stares at Katsuki. \n\u201cHello, gorgeous,\u201d he breathes, almost like he\u2019s not sure he\u2019s saying it. \nKatsuki\u2019s heart stutters in his chest. Shit.\nFuck it. \nHe rolls over on his side to better face Deku, not nervous whatsoever. \u201cCan I get some advice on something?\u201d \nDeku looks a little surprised by the question, then smiles. \u201cSure, pretty boy.\u201d \nKatsuki meets his stunning viridian eyes, heart racing in his chest but voice steady thanks to some form of magic. \u201cIs it morally reprehensible want to kiss a guy you hit with your car?\u201d \nDeku\u2019s eyes shoot wide, and he splutters, \u201cUh, you-um.\u201d He clears his throat, smiling a bit. \u201cI mean, not if he wants to\u2026too.\u201d \nKatsuki\u2019s heart leaps at the implications of that, and he reaches out to lay a hand on Deku\u2019s waist without much thinking, once again emboldened by his nervousness. \u201cAlright. Do you want to?\u201d \nDeku\u2019s wobbly smile spreads further. \u201cYeah.\u201d \nThey meet in the middle, Katsuki using his hold on Deku\u2019s waist to pull him closer as Deku rests a hand on his shoulder. It\u2019s not particularly good, which Katsuki chalks up to inexperience on both ends, but Deku tastes like salty soba sauce and he\u2019s warm and soft and Deku. And that\u2019s more than fucking enough for Katsuki to start thinking this is the best idea he\u2019s ever had. \nFuck yes.\nThey pull apart after a matter of seconds, and Deku meets his eyes with the soft green and a blinding smile. Katsuki tries to control himself, but when, instead of pulling away, Deku pulls him closer, he can\u2019t.\nHe kisses him again, less unsure this time, and he can tell Deku feels the same. This kiss provides more justification for Katsuki\u2019s racing heart. Katsuki runs a hand through his soft curls, pulling him even closer. \nMaybe this was meant to happen. Maybe it was fate. Maybe they\u2019re soulbound and the universe just has a weird ass sense of humor. Maybe this is where he belongs. \nOr maybe all that\u2019s bullshit and Katsuki\u2019s just a hormonal teenager \u2013 the most likely option in his eyes. But what he knows for sure is that he doesn\u2019t want to stop kissing Deku anytime soon. \nDeku pulls away the tiniest amount. \u201cWait, so this is a date?\u201d \nEven if he\u2019s a total idiot."
