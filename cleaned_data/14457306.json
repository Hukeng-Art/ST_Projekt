    "text": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason\u2019s too old to steal tires. It\u2019s beneath him. Anyway, he peaked back when he was fourteen. It\u2019s hard to top stealing the tires off the Batmobile. But someone has imposed street parking on a fucking McLaren F1 road car, and Jason feels obligated to defend the car\u2019s honor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The thing can hit 62 mph in 3.2 seconds, tops out at over 240 mph, is one of only 65 or so like it in the world, and it\u2019s parked, all alone, unwatched, unprotected, half a block away from a line of clubs where pretty idiots mix glitter-infused bodily fluids all night. Someone\u2019s going to be covering the thing in sparkly piss by 2am, guaranteed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Jason tells it, passing a reverent hand over its sharply-sloping hood. \u201cI\u2019m here to rescue you.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The bitch of the thing is, whoever owns it must care at least a little, because they\u2019ve set it up with a security system that delivers one hell of a shock when Jason tries to pick his way into the car. He could bash the windows open and take a more direct approach, but he\u2019s here to avenge the thing, not destroy it. The older he gets, the more he can appreciate how the two are different.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So he can\u2019t steal the thing, at least not with the tools in his bike, but he can do his best to impress upon its owner the dangers of leaving beautiful things in bad parts of town. Maybe by taking the tires, the idiot who owns the car will learn to at least park it in some kind of garage.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Street parking, Jason thinks. He pats the car consolingly on the roof and then goes back to his bike for his tools.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He\u2019s taken one tire off and is halfway through removing the second when he hears someone clearing their throat pointedly. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, \u201ckeep walking.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m done walking,\u201d a man says. \u201cThis is my destination. That\u2019s my car. Put the tire back.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason peers under the car, where he can see a pair of fussy shoes pointed his direction. He frowns and then straightens up so he can stare over the top of the car at the man who left this beautiful car next to a curb stained with dozens of years of post-party vomit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pretty idiot, he thinks, taking in the dark hair and dark eyes and the neat, clean lines of his face. Probably twenty-one, but maybe not. Jason\u2019s eyes narrow on what is absolutely a smear of pink glitter running from his lips to halfway up his cheek, like someone kissed him and he tried to wipe it off.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exchanging glitter-infused bodily fluids. He fucking knew it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNope,\u201d Jason says, ducking back down by the tire. \u201cI\u2019m taking all four of them. You can have the car back when I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d His words are slurred, but not as badly as Jason would expect, given that it\u2019s nearly 1am and the idiot looks like he\u2019s having some trouble standing up straight. \u201cIt\u2019s my car.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou park it on these streets,\u201d Jason says, \u201cand it is everyone\u2019s car. Find a fucking garage, asshole. Take a cab. Don\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m blacklisted by a lot of cab companies,\u201d he says, like that\u2019s any kind of explanation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo lie about your name, for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Jason says, exasperated. \u201cChrist, like you\u2019ve never been banned from a bar before? Recycle one of your old fake IDs. You\u2019ve had one since you were, what? Fourteen?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay,\u201d the man says, \u201ca little on the nose. Are you with the press? Is this a setup? Are you following me?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason straightens back up just so the idiot can get the full effect of his incredulous sneer. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI am not following you. Why the fuck would I waste my time on some idiot who can\u2019t fucking navigate his way to a parking garage?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The man rocks forward on his toes, eyes narrowing, and Jason thinks that\u2019s a pretty bold move, given how he wobbly he was a few seconds ago.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t recognize me,\u201d he says, after a long moment. It\u2019s probably supposed to be a question, but either he can\u2019t coordinate that kind of inflection or he\u2019s just too taken aback to manage it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason squints at him. He does look vaguely familiar, now that he takes a second look. \u201cYou some kind of actor?\u201d He tries.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2014what?\u201d He blinks bloodshot eyes at him. \u201cI feel that way sometimes, I guess.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason nods slowly. \u201cLike, a porn actor?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGo to hell,\u201d he says, with a reflexive prissiness that Jason finds a little charming. He falters the second after that, though, tipping his head to the side. \u201cAlthough,\u201d he says, \u201calthough, technically--\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf you gotta argue technicalities about your porn career,\u201d Jason says, \u201cthen you absolutely have one.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The man shakes his head, looking about half as offended as he should be. \u201cI never got paid.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason rolls his eyes. \u201cThat just means you\u2019ve got a bad agent.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen.\u201d He runs a shaky hand through his hair, which is already standing up in about every feasible direction. He looks like he\u2019s been making out with an electrical outlet. \u201cListen, will you just put the tires back? I\u2019ve got places to be that aren\u2019t here.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ve got somewhere to be that isn\u2019t the alley behind a bunch of shitty bars in a neighborhood you don\u2019t belong in?\u201d Jason feigns surprise, but he doesn\u2019t put much effort into it. \u201cColor me fucking shocked, princess. Hope you\u2019ve got a bus pass. And some pepper spray. It\u2019s not a great time of night for public transportation.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He groans, theatrically, eyes and hands rolling heavenward, like he thinks some celestial being is going to interfere on his behalf. Or maybe like he\u2019s lodging a formal complaint with management. \u201cCome on,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like shit. I had a bad night. Just put them back.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason thinks this guy has only ever felt one kind of shitty in his life, and, since it\u2019s the self-inflicted kind of shitty, he doesn\u2019t have much sympathy. \u201cOh, sorry, princess,\u201d he says, \u201care the drugs wearing off? Coming back down into the dirt with the rest of us?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The man squints at him, focusing completely on him for maybe the first time in this entire conversation. Jason\u2019s a little alarmed to find there\u2019s a lot of intelligence in those eyes; he hadn\u2019t expected it. He wonders if he\u2019ll need to threaten him, maybe bash him lightly around the head a couple times to encourage him not to remember his face.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After several long seconds of staring, he starts fumbling in his pants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWoah,\u201d Jason says, genuinely startled. \u201cWhere the hell is this going?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He looks up at Jason, awfully snide for a man with his hand down the front of his pants, and then pulls his hand back up, wallet cradled in his palm. \u201cPlease,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019re not that cute.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m a fucking heartbreaker,\u201d Jason says, letting out a relieved breath. \u201cWatch your fucking mouth.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay, heartbreaker,\u201d he says, \u201chow much to put the tires back on the car?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason rolls his eyes again and gestures at him with the lug wrench. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I just beat you up and steal your money? Is this the first time you\u2019ve been to a bad part of town? Don\u2019t show me your wallet, asshole.

He nudges Jason with his shoe, and Jason barely suppresses the instinct to take that shoe off and beat him with it. \u201cYou wanna get something to eat?\u201d He asks. \u201cAfter this?

In fact, one of the best parts of his new job is that he gets to quit both of his old ones, and Tony comes with him to do it, riding along in the McLaren, offering up cheerfully appalled commentary on Jason\u2019s vocational aspirations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh my God,\u201d Tony says, hooking his sunglasses half off his face to stare gleefully at the first place they stop. \u201cTell me you dance.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason rolls his eyes so hard he damn near sprains them. \u201cYeah, asshole,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s a real demand for male dancers at The Boobie Trap.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYour tits,\u201d Tony yells, at Jason\u2019s retreating back, \u201care life-changing.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason flips him off with both hands, but he can\u2019t fault the guy for accuracy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The warehouse goes a little better, because Tony gets immediately distracted by all the dissected machines. Jason spends a few minutes bullshitting his way toward a goodbye with Jo, but then they have to leave quick, because Tony pops his head into the office and says, \u201cHey, just curious, how much of this is stolen? Because I don\u2019t have a lot of experience with this sort of thing, but I\u2019ve noticed you guys have a real grudge against serial numbers.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason figures the whole thing will last a week, maybe a handful of days. He doesn\u2019t take direction well. Never has. But he makes Tony pay him for three months up front, in cash, and so, even if things go to hell and Jason decides to leave in the middle of the night, he\u2019s still got the cash.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He can be gone by morning, surface in L.A. or Phoenix or Las Vegas.\u00a0 And, with money like that, he\u2019ll be better off than he has been in years.

That\u2019s not why Jason stays. Hell, it\u2019s not why he signed up in the first place. When he\u2019s feeling charitable, he lets himself pretend he\u2019s here for the cars, and the pancakes, and the endless series of truly insane parties Tony brings him to.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When he\u2019s not feeling charitable, he finds something else to think about.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Granted, it\u2019s not exactly a dream job. He\u2019s still working with Tony Stark, who\u2019s a Goddamn walking, talking, whiskey-shooting disaster on his best days.

Not in pants like that,\u201d Tony says, in that upbeat, agreeable way he uses whenever he knows he\u2019s in trouble but can\u2019t fathom why.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason grabs a stack of papers off Tony\u2019s desk and throws them at him. They explode into a hurricane of 8\u00bdx11, spiraling around Tony in a sad, fluttery storm before dropping to the ground. Tony blinks at him, looking genuinely nonplussed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWow,\u201d he says.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason almost throws the stapler at him, too, but Tony\u2019s reflexes aren\u2019t great, and he doesn\u2019t want to accidentally staple him in the eye. No matter how pissed he is. \u201cNot your Barbie,\u201d he yells, \u201cnot your pet, not your fucking toy, Tony. I am a person. Get it? I am a human fucking being.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d Tony says, slowly, \u201cI\u2019d puzzled that one out on my own, actually.

Because Tony doesn\u2019t get it. He still doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cYou can\u2019t just move me wherever you want me. You can\u2019t send movers to my apartment when I\u2019m not there, box up all my shit, and move it into your fucking castle by the sea, asshole!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony\u2019s face contorts like he\u2019s trying not to laugh. A second later, he shifts right into hurt. \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cyou can move out if you don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason groans, deep in his throat, and covers his face with his hands. \u201cGoddamn it, Tony,\u201d he says, \u201cGoddamn it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs this about those unregistered firearms?\u201d Tony asks, helpfully. \u201cBecause these guys are very discreet.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason peels his hands off his face so he can stare at Tony. \u201cDid you,\u201d he says, slowly, \u201cask for an itemized list of every single one of my personal items, Tony? Did you do that? Did you honestly have them catalog everything I own?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony hesitates. His mouth opens and shuts, and he drums his fingers on the desk. \u201cWell,\u201d he says, tentatively.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason very calmly picks up the stapler on Tony\u2019s desk and throws it across the room.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s standard practice!\u201d Tony tells him, earnestly. \u201cIt\u2019s standard practice, so they can be sure nothing\u2019s lost in transit. Anyway, I just kind of glanced over it. I can see \u2013 looking back, in retrospect \u2013 how maybe this was a little invasive, but the commute was ridiculous. You were wearing yourself out. You slept in a car. Twice! Twice last week, you slept in one of my cars because I kept you out too late, and so it just made sense. It just made sense to move you in.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou moved me into your house,\u201d Jason says. \u201cYou moved me in, and you went through all my stuff, and, for fuck\u2019s sake, Tony, I gave a kid in a foster home a concussion for touching my stuff once. You can\u2019t do this shit. It\u2019s my stuff.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou were in foster care?\u201d There\u2019s something off about the question. Tony\u2019s got that weird look on his face again, the one that means he knows he\u2019s in trouble.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason settles heavily into the chair across the desk from Tony. \u201cYou pulled every record there is on me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony presses his mouth into a near-invisible line, like he thinks there\u2019s a chance in hell that it will help him shut himself up. Three seconds later, he caves. \u201cI was curious,\u201d he says. \u201cI get curious about things, and then I--\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen you run them into the ground,\u201d Jason says. \u201cI know.\u201d He does. He\u2019s seen people and things and theories catch Tony\u2019s attention. He goes after them like a bloodhound. There\u2019s no stopping him. Once his brain gives him a question, he doesn\u2019t give up until he can hand it back an answer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tony says. He looks deflated. He looks worried that Jason\u2019s going to leave instead of ready to fire him, which is bullshit because Jason just tore in here and threw things and yelled at him. Jason\u2019s an asshole.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of course, Tony\u2019s an asshole, too. Maybe they deserve each other.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou gotta ask me,\u201d Jason tells him. \u201cI don\u2019t like when things just happen to me, Tony. Okay? I don\u2019t like no warning. When people just make things happen, and I don\u2019t get a say.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony nods. He fiddles with the nearest pen and then hooks a notepad over, starts writing. \u201cI\u2019ll have them move your stuff back tonight.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason takes a long look at Tony\u2019s face, the practiced nonchalance, the way he only shows tension in the tightness of his jaw and shoulders. He sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you better not have put me in any of the shitty guestrooms.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course not,\u201d Tony says, looking up at him sharply. He hesitates for a second and then starts to smile. \u201cI gave you a suite.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So then, suddenly, Jason\u2019s not even paying for his own living expenses. He lives at Tony\u2019s place, doesn\u2019t pay rent, and, whenever he\u2019s too lazy to go to the grocery store, he just puts what he wants on a list, and someone else drops it off for him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s downright surreal, how easy life becomes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because, all in all, being Tony\u2019s security team isn\u2019t a particularly demanding job. He drives, sometimes, when Tony doesn\u2019t want to bother waiting for his driver, and he goes where Tony goes, when Tony\u2019s going somewhere other than his workshop. And he only has to dress like an idiot when they\u2019re going somewhere with an actual dress code, and even that\u2019s not so bad, really, because Tony pays for all the stupid clothes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh shit,\u201d Tony says, the first time he comes upstairs from his workshop to find Jason loitering near the piano in a tux, \u201cis this what you look like when you\u2019re making an effort?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis is what I look like when I\u2019m grumpy and uncomfortable,\u201d Jason corrects. He\u2019d spent fifteen minutes figuring out the stupid tie. He\u2019s still pissed about the shoes. \u201cHow long are we gonna be at this bullshit party?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCouple hours, sunshine,\u201d Tony says. \u201cGotta charm a few skittish investors. Show a little leg. You know how it is.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHuh,\u201d Jason says, as he herds him toward the car. \u201cIs that why your pants are so tight?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony snorts and flashes him one of his unnaturally bright smiles, the ones that make him seem like he\u2019s lit up from the inside. Those smiles get people in trouble. Jason\u2019s seen iron wills crumple in the face of them. Fortunately, he\u2019s been building up a tolerance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m wearing them for you,\u201d Tony tells him, and Jason gags audibly and then shoves him into the backseat of the car, tries desperately to hide his smile as he climbs in beside him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those first couple of months, Jason doesn\u2019t do his job very well. He\u2019s too worried about getting fired. He\u2019s busy doing what Tony wants instead of doing what Tony\u2019s paying him for.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason has fun, most of the time. It\u2019s impossible not to have fun around Tony. He creates it, easy as breathing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The only trouble is the physics of the thing, that whole problem where everything that goes up must eventually come back down. When Tony\u2019s up, he\u2019s so fucking up that Jason thinks someone should put a leash around his ankle, make sure he stays in orbit. But there\u2019s something mean in Tony, some kind of rich boy self-loathing that Jason rolled his eyes at, in the beginning, but quickly grows to hate, because it causes him innumerable issues.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t know what the hell to say to Tony about it. It\u2019s not his place, obviously, but that wouldn\u2019t stop him if he had the first fucking clue how to approach it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cChrist, Tony,\u201d he says, the first time he spends half an hour in a club bathroom, waiting for Tony to stop puking long enough to put him in the car. \u201cEverybody\u2019s lonely, you know? Tequila is terrible company.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t help. Tony\u2019s capacity to ignore things he doesn\u2019t want to hear is damn near superhuman.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason makes his peace with the alcohol, especially when they\u2019re home. He comes up with strategies, field tests them, hones their effectiveness. He learns the early warning signs, knows when Tony\u2019s still gently pushing too much and hasn\u2019t fallen into disaster levels yet. He successfully pays off several bartenders to give him shots of vodka that are 75% water. More than once, he switches Tony\u2019s full shot glass for an empty one right before Tony tosses it back, and the poor, dumb, self-destructive bastard doesn\u2019t even notice.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The drinking is obnoxious and inconvenient and occasionally alarming, but Tony\u2019s twenty-two. Jason knows what that\u2019s like. He\u2019s twenty-three, but he grew up in Gotham, so his mid-teens were the rough equivalent. There are plenty of nights Jason doesn\u2019t remember. Plenty of loud mistakes, plenty of alleys he decorated with puke.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s the drugs that scare the shit out of him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He only sees them once. Despite the rumors, Tony doesn\u2019t actually seem that interested. There\u2019s weed, sometimes, but it\u2019s California. And there are worse things that could happen to Tony than an evening spent trying to use tortilla chips to explain particle physics to Jason. At least he\u2019s eating. At least he\u2019s sitting down.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first time Jason sees someone hand Tony a bag of pills is also the last time Jason sees it, because he throws an unholy fit about it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Tony says, the whole way home, as Jason throws the pills, one by one, out the window and refuses to talk to him. \u201cJason, it was a party. I\u2019m not even drunk. Let\u2019s go back. Come on.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey, asshole,\u201d Jason says, when they pull up in front of the house. \u201cHey. Listen.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony goes quiet. He gives Jason a searching, sideways look.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy mom overdosed when I was sixteen,\u201d Jason says. It doesn\u2019t even hurt to say. Because he\u2019s not saying it. They aren\u2019t having this conversation. He\u2019s going to forget this whole evening, and this whole talk, as soon as he gets out of the car. \u201cMy mom overdosed on shit I bought for her. Okay?\u00a0 She was sick all the time, and it made her feel better, so I\u2019d get it for her. And then one of Batman\u2019s fucking asshole enemies mixed up a bad batch, and killed half the junkies in the Crime Alley in one night.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony makes a quiet, hurt noise. Jason ignores it. He can\u2019t think about it. He can\u2019t think about any of it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI watched her die for years. It was fucked up. I stuck around \u2018til it was over, because she was my mom, and I loved her.\u201d He looks over at Tony, makes sure he\u2019s looking back at him. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna stick around for you. Understand? I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s casual. I don\u2019t care if you only do it a couple times. You fuck with that shit again, and I am leaving the next chance I get.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony rubs at his face. \u201cI\u2019m not--\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t care what you\u2019re not,\u201d Jason says, louder than he means to. He cuts himself off, lowers his volume, regains control. \u201cMy mom, she wasn\u2019t an addict either. Swore it, every day of her life, until she fucking died from the thing she wasn\u2019t. And I\u2019ll be gone, Tony. I\u2019m not fucking with you. I\u2019ll be gone before you even come back down.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay,\u201d Tony says. He breathes out, twists his hands together like he doesn\u2019t know what to do with them. \u201cOkay, alright. I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood,\u201d Jason says. Some part of him practically sings with relief, but he\u2019s heard promises like that before. He\u2019ll hold off on believing them this time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood talk,\u201d he says, and he climbs out of the car and shuts the door, takes the keys with him, and goes to his room to start working on forgetting any of this ever happened.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The cars are easily Jason\u2019s second favorite part of the job. Tony has a regular driver \u2013 Happy, who turns out to be a decent guy once he\u2019s decided Jason\u2019s not a degenerate, or a gold-digger, or Tony\u2019s pet drug dealer \u2013 and a whole pack of backups, but sometimes Tony gets sick of all his attendants, and then it\u2019ll be just the two of them, setting off on some dumb adventure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason likes driving. Always has. All of Tony\u2019s cars are beautiful, and, most of the time, Tony lets him take whichever one he wants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason doesn\u2019t even mind when Tony picks someone up while they\u2019re out, because, hell, Jason knows exactly what he\u2019s signing up for, when he considers all the lined-up machines and picks the flashiest one. Besides, it\u2019s good for Tony to get out of his workshop. And it\u2019s nice, when Tony finds some giggly brunette at a research conference or a sweet redhead at a gala or a blonde with a crooked grin at some shitty bar. It\u2019s nice, when they appreciate him, when he appreciates them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s less nice when Tony leans into that self-loathing and finds someone who\u2019ll echo it back at him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason does his best to ignore it, when that happens. Not his place. Not his business. And no matter how much he\u2019s willing to push things, Jason really, honestly doesn\u2019t want to get fired from what is unquestionably the best job he\u2019s ever had.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And then Tony picks up some asshole at a charity benefit who spends the first half of the ride home telling Tony\u2019s he\u2019s twice as pretty as his dad but half as smart, and it\u2019s is so fucking creepy and weird that Jason gives up on dental insurance and longevity checks and pulls the car over in the middle of the highway.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGet the fuck out,\u201d he says, without turning around.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The guy opts to get loud, instead, which means Jason has to get out of the car, come around the side, and physically drag him out like a recalcitrant preschooler who doesn\u2019t want to get out of the ball pit. Jason drops him on the sidewalk, spits in his face just for making him work for it, and then climbs back in the car and takes off.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat was,\u201d Tony says, \u201cwow. Just. Really uncalled for.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t give a shit,\u201d Jason says. \u201cThe only person who\u2019s allowed to shit-talk you in this car is me. Me, and Rhodes. And sometimes Happy. But that\u2019s it. Everyone else can be respectful, or they can take a Goddamn walk.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony scowls out the window, neck craned to stare at the disappearing figure of the man they\u2019re leaving behind. \u201cFuck off,\u201d he says, \u201cI don\u2019t need you to look after me.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason makes a noise that could, charitably, be called skeptical. \u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have fucking hired me to do it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony turns around to stare at him in the rearview mirror, narrow-eyed and unhappy, and Jason figures he\u2019s fired, but, after a moment, Tony just sighs and tips his head to rest against the window. \u201cLet\u2019s get pancakes,\u201d he says. \u201cI know a diner nearby.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The diner isn\u2019t as good as the first place Tony dragged him to, but, if that\u2019s supposed to be a deterrent, it doesn\u2019t work. Two weeks later, Jason kicks out a leggy blonde that treats Tony like an ATM with a pulse. A few days after that, Jason drops a man twice Tony\u2019s age outside the closest strip club because the guy won\u2019t stop trying to talk Tony into blowing him in broad daylight while Jason\u2019s driving.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAw, c\u2019mon,\u201d Tony complains, \u201che was kind of sweet.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGross,\u201d Jason says. \u201cI\u2019m gonna puke, Tony. I am. Just all over myself, all over the upholstery. Everywhere.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m gonna get a privacy window installed in every one of my cars,\u201d Tony says. \u201cYou\u2019re ruining my life.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFuck you, you\u2019re ruining my life,\u201d Jason says.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over the next six months, Jason kicks seven different people out of Tony\u2019s cars. He leaves the horny ones outside strip clubs and porn shops, leaves gold-diggers at banks. And once, memorably, he drops a guy outside the ER with blood on his mouth, and spends the whole drive back to Tony\u2019s place ignoring the sluggish bleeding of his knuckles.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFuck,\u201d Tony says, quietly, when they\u2019re back at Tony\u2019s place and Jason\u2019s hefting him out of the car. \u201cJay, I\u2019m fucked up. Tell that guy to go home.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSure,\u201d Jason says. And then he pitches his voice a little louder and yells, at no one, \u201cHey, asshole, fuck off.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony laughs and leans into him, presses his face into Jason\u2019s neck. He\u2019s lighter than he should be. He can\u2019t keep any weight on. Jason\u2019s going to have to start badgering him to eat.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t know how the hell this is his life. He doesn\u2019t know how he ended up here, worried that a billionaire isn\u2019t eating enough. But the shitty, inarguable fact of the matter is that Tony\u2019s cars are Jason\u2019s second favorite part of his job, and Tony is his favorite.

He\u2019s been trying to lead by example.

He\u2019s also been sending money to a few nonprofits back home, the ones that had actually helped him and his mom, back when they needed it. Other than that, he doesn\u2019t have much use for it.

He doesn\u2019t know how to be any clearer about it than he\u2019s been already. He has no intention of leaving. This is the best job he\u2019s ever had. Hell, it\u2019s the best job he\u2019s ever likely to have. He\u2019s not going anywhere.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason realizes he has to quit his job on a Friday night. It hits like a right hook to the ribs, damn near knocks the breath out of him when it lands. It\u2019s a Friday night, in December. It also happens to be Christmas Eve.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They\u2019ve been going to parties and galas and dinners and events almost every day since Thanksgiving. Tony calls it the busy season, but Jason figures he makes it that way. Burns himself out on people so, by the time Christmas rolls around, it feels like a gift, spending it alone.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason doesn\u2019t mind it so much, the empty house, the slow, sleepy, business-as-usual Christmas morning. He hasn\u2019t celebrated very many Christmases. And spending Christmas alone with Tony is a hell of a lot better than spending it playing bouncer at a strip club. But it seems to weigh on Tony.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It hits a fever pitch around mid-December, when the anniversary of his parents\u2019 death rolls around. He won\u2019t sleep for days leading up to it, just dashes around from party to project to pretty distraction, drinks coffee all morning and whiskey all night. And then he falls into a pit on December 16th, stays in his room all damn day, and emerges the next, ready for whatever array of events awaits him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And now it\u2019s the 24th, and they haven\u2019t left the house since they got back around 1am the night before. Tony\u2019s been in his workshop most of the day, and Jason spent a few hours in the gym, because he\u2019s got this terrible inkling that his personal trainer is going to come for him on January 1st with some kind of unholy new year, new you rallying cry.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not that Jason needs a new him. He\u2019s a damn nightmare now. Turns out, with proper nutrition and a personally tailored exercise program, his body is happy to pack on muscle like it secretly always wanted to be Batman and was just waiting for the opportunity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 People seem to appreciate his new body. Jason doesn\u2019t blame them, although he privately thinks the wirier, sharper version of him had a certain feral charm to it, too. On several separate occasions, people have wandered out of Tony\u2019s room in the morning, found Jason at the breakfast table, and then tried to follow him back to his suite. Twice, he\u2019s taken them up on it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, he\u2019s never been a saint.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As is evidenced by the fact that it\u2019s Christmas Eve, and he\u2019s trying to decide if he should wait for Tony to crawl out of his lab or go out to the bars alone, see if any of the lonely people out drinking on Christmas Eve would welcome some company.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He\u2019s still weighing out his options when he hears a rattling knock on his door followed immediately by a burst of song.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c---won\u2019t go until we get some, we won\u2019t go until we get some, we won\u2019t go until--\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey,\u201d Jason says, pulling the door open to find Tony standing there, barefoot, with oil stains on the front of his white undershirt and a dumb, happy grin on his face. This is the first sign of trouble, but it\u2019s a glancing blow more than a knockout punch; Jason\u2019s seen Tony like this plenty of times. \u201cAre you caroling me or sexually harassing me?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony salutes him with a glass. He\u2019s got two, and he pushes one of them into Jason\u2019s chest until he accepts it. \u201cIf you carol right,\u201d Tony tells him, earnestly, \u201cyou can do both at the same time.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHuh,\u201d Jason says, biting back at smile. \u201cYou got any sexy renditions of \u2018Twelve Days\u2019 in your repertoire?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cToo easy,\u201d Tony tells him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I hear,\u201d Jason mumbles, rolling his eyes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2018Twelve Fucks of Christmas,\u2019\u201d Tony says, with dignity, and then he clears his throat and launches right into it. \u201cOn the first day of Christmas, my lover gave to me--\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf this song includes bestiality,\u201d Jason says, \u201cI just want to be clear, I\u2019m quitting immediately.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony falters. He hesitates for a second. \u201cWould you,\u201d he says, \u201cbe interested in \u2018Jingle Balls\u2019 instead?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWould I,\u201d Jason says.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOr,\u201d Tony says, with a burst of enthusiasm, \u201c\u2018Rudolph the Red--\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBestiality,\u201d Jason says, sharply. \u201cGot my letter of resignation all typed up.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSpoilsport,\u201d Tony accuses. He\u2019s flushed and smiling. Happy. Whatever work he\u2019s doing in his lab must be going really well. He nods his head toward the cup in Jason\u2019s hand. \u201cDrink up,\u201d he says. \u201cI made you some eggnog.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason blinks down at the glass in his hand and takes an investigative sip. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, theory confirmed, \u201cthis is actually just whiskey.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh.\u201d Tony furrows his brow. \u201cWell, I thought about eggnog when I poured it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood enough,\u201d Jason says, and taps his glass against Tony\u2019s before taking a healthy sip.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They\u2019re definitely not going anywhere tonight. They stayed in last year, too. It was nice, Jason thinks, although he doesn\u2019t remember most of it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey,\u201d Tony says, gaze suddenly scuttling to the side. \u201cWanna watch It\u2019s a Wonderful Life with me?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason thinks it\u2019s maybe a bad idea to watch a movie about a man who wants to off himself on Christmas Eve, but, if he remembers right, things turn out alright in the end. And Tony looks awkward and hopeful and wary, like he\u2019s ready to be dismissed or laughed at. It looks like this matters to him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason\u2019s not familiar with Christmas traditions. Sure, he knows the basics. The national ones, the everyday ones. But his family never had Christmas consistently enough to have habits. He wonders if this was something Tony used to do with his parents, when they were around.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah,\u201d Jason says, with a nod. \u201cSure, Tony.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony beams at him, bright and grateful. That\u2019s the second warning shot. But Tony\u2019s smiled at him plenty of times, and Jason doesn\u2019t take proper precautions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd Die Hard after,\u201d Tony says, decisively.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSounds fucking swell,\u201d Jason says.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So that\u2019s how they end up sprawled out next to each other on the couch, eating leftover Thai takeout and watching movies until something like three in the morning. There\u2019s a bottle of whiskey on the coffee table, half-empty, and a bottle of eggnog, unopened, and a fire in the fireplace and blankets wrapped around both of them. It\u2019s easily the best Christmas Eve Jason\u2019s ever had, with the possible exclusion of the one from last year that he can\u2019t remember so well.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony starts dozing thirty minutes into Die Hard. He always gets clingy when he falls asleep, but Jason\u2019s ready for it. Tony burrows in, and Jason wraps an arm around his shoulders, and it\u2019s easy and comfortable, not complicated at all. Tony keeps fading in and out, tracking the movie by sound more than sight. And then he stirs long enough to murmur \u201cyippie ki yay, motherfucker\u201d right into the skin of Jason\u2019s neck.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the moment Jason realizes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony\u2019s a warm, steady weight against Jason\u2019s side, breathing soft and even, eyelashes standing out against the ever-present bags under his eyes. He smells like engines and whiskey and dumb rich boy shampoo.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And Jason is stupidly, hopelessly, helplessly in love with him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fuck.

He\u2019s not going to leave Tony alone, especially at this time of year. And, anyway, it\u2019s a shitty thing to do, quitting because he\u2019s too unprofessional to keep his emotions to himself. He doesn\u2019t need to make it doubly shitty by quitting when Tony\u2019s still fighting his way back toward what passes as stable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He\u2019s making plans, trying to find his way forward, when the benefit invitation arrives in the mail. Jason can tell them just by weight, usually, so he passes it to Tony over breakfast and is more than a little taken aback when Tony glances at it, snorts, and then pushes it back his direction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot your maid,\u201d Jason reminds him. \u201cThrow it away yourself.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou throw it away,\u201d Tony says. \u201cIt\u2019s addressed to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason blinks, frowning skeptically at the heavy envelope in front of him. \u201cNo shit?\u201d Tony just shrugs at him, so Jason reaches over, rips the envelope open, and shakes the contents out onto the breakfast table.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He, Jason Todd, has been invited to the annual Thomas Wayne Memorial Clinic benefit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, did you make a donation?\u201d Tony asks, leaning over into Jason\u2019s space to study the paper in his hand.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2014yeah.\u201d Jason\u2019s sent them more money than he can hold in his head at one time. He\u2019s bad at money, he thinks. He keeps giving it away. But every time too much accumulates in his accounts, he thinks about being fourteen and hungry enough to steal the tires off the Batmobile, thinks about how much he\u2019d hated rich assholes who kept more than they needed and left him without enough.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNice of you,\u201d Tony says, a little too analytically too pass as casual. \u201cGiving back to the hometown.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cParts of it.\u201d The parts that mattered.

He thinks, every year, he should go back, find her grave, give her flowers or whatever the hell good sons do. But he never does.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSure,\u201d he says, because here he is, holding an actual invitation in his hands, and Tony\u2019s checked the calendar, and so, if he doesn\u2019t go, then he\u2019s just a coward and an asshole, who throws money at problems but never looks at the heart of them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He takes a quick, careful breath and then drops the invitation, face-down on the table. Tony\u2019s watching him cautiously, just out of the corner of his eyes, like he\u2019s trying to be polite about how he\u2019s staring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWanna be my date?\u201d The words are out before Jason knows what the hell they\u2019re planning. He\u2019s been ambushed, and he feels betrayed. But Tony just jerks his head up to look at him, and grins, like there\u2019s not a single thing weird about what Jason just said to him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re damn right,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m warning you, I\u2019m gonna blast different covers of \u2018The Boys Are Back in Town\u2019 the entire time we\u2019re within Gotham city limits.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGoddamn it, nevermind,\u201d Jason says, rolling his eyes, \u201cI\u2019m taking Happy.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Happy does end up tagging along, mostly because they need a driver, and Jason\u2019s endlessly grateful he\u2019s there, because Happy only lets Tony play the stupid song three times in a row before he pretends the sound system\u2019s broken.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Their hotel is in the Diamond District, because of course it is. Jason feels like a tourist in his own city. It\u2019s weird, staring out the window, looking at the wrong side of skyscrapers he\u2019d grown up seeing every day.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He visits his mom\u2019s grave the morning after they arrive, brings a bouquet of flowers that he asked the lady at the flower shop to pick out. There\u2019s nothing much to mark the spot, and Jason keeps meaning to do something about that, buy a real headstone, do something, but, as soon as he thinks about his dead mom in the ground, his head fills up with static so fast that he never gets anything done. He lays the flowers on the ground, stands there until he can\u2019t anymore, and then he runs back to Tony, who doesn\u2019t ask him where he\u2019s been.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over the next couple of days, he lets Tony take him out to a series of restaurants that Jason heard about as a kid but has never actually been near. When he walks in next to Tony, not one single person looks at him like he doesn\u2019t belong, but the wait staff raise their eyebrows, sometimes, when he\u2019s not careful enough about his accent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAside from the architecture,\u201d Tony says, one night, \u201cand the weather, which is, objectively, fucking abhorrent, I don\u2019t get what\u2019s so bad about Gotham. Seems like a pretty normal city to me.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason laughs. \u201cWell, Jesus, Tony,\u201d he says, gesturing around him helplessly, \u201cthat\u2019s because you\u2019re in the Diamond District.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The benefit\u2019s up in Crest Hill, which is just as bad as the Diamond District, but they have to go through the Bowery and Crime Alley to get there. Jason runs them right through the heart of it, instead of taking any of the easier, prettier loops or the flyovers. Happy gets visibly uneasy as soon as they enter the East End, and Tony leans forward, staring out the window, eyes focused and face a mask of something Jason can\u2019t read.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pity, maybe.

He\u2019s watching his tone, which is nice of him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah,\u201d Jason says, after a beat.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It looks even worse than he remembers. The people they pass stare hard at the car, and Jason stares back, but it\u2019s more difficult to meet their eyes than it should be. They\u2019re his people, if he has people, and he still feels himself tensing up, like he\u2019s some stupid, lost rich kid, who thinks poverty is an infectious disease.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He\u2019s not ashamed, exactly.

He\u2019ll have Happy take another route back to the hotel. He doesn\u2019t care what it makes him. He doesn\u2019t want Tony to see this again.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ve done real well for yourself, kid,\u201d Happy says, looking at him in the rearview mirror.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThanks,\u201d Jason says. He feels like a coward and a traitor. But he can\u2019t see how it would\u2019ve done anyone any damn good, if he\u2019d stayed. He\u2019d probably be dead by now.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony nudges his ankle with his ridiculously shiny shoe. Jason doesn\u2019t respond, and, after a moment, Tony reaches over, settles a hand on Jason\u2019s shoulder. He leaves it that way the whole ride to the event hall and then, once they\u2019re there, he gets a drink in Jason\u2019s hand within sixty seconds of walking through the door.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cChrist, Tony,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAs hell,\u201d Tony agrees, leering at him appreciatively.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It startles a laugh out of Jason and then, after that, things are easier. It\u2019s a surreal evening. This isn\u2019t a Wayne Foundation benefit, so most of Gotham\u2019s highest tier of royalty have passed on attending, but Bruce Wayne shows up an hour or so after they do, and Tony lights up when he sees him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh,\u201d he says, \u201clet\u2019s go talk to Bruce.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGod,\u201d Jason says, cringing reflexively. \u201cNo, Tony.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d Tony says. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy. He\u2019s fun.\u201d He throws a companionable arm around Jason\u2019s shoulders and herds him along, and Jason could duck under that arm in a heartbeat, but he doesn\u2019t want to.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And so that\u2019s how he ends up standing there while Tony and Bruce exchange the kind of pleasantries that only wealthy people understand. Jason lets the references to vacation properties, and stock options, and investor confidence, and celebrity cocaine addictions wash over him while he stares around the room, trying to decide how much money he could raise for the Memorial Clinic by holding the entire party at gunpoint and demanding their jewelry.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c---from Gotham,\u201d Tony\u2019s saying, in the background. \u201cStole the tires off the Batmobile once, actually.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTony,\u201d Jason says, his head snapping back around. \u201cTony, no.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony blinks. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, \u201cis that one of those stories we don\u2019t tell in Gotham?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason grimaces, looks toward Bruce Wayne, and finds one hell of an interesting expression staring back at him. For a second, Bruce has an expression like Tony in the workshop, focused with an almost unsettling intensity, and then he blinks and throws a wide, charming grin Jason\u2019s direction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDid you really?\u201d He sounds like he doesn\u2019t believe it, but like he\u2019s willing to laugh along anyway.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe did,\u201d Tony says. \u201cTell him.

They were custom,\u201d Jason says. If he finishes the story quickly, he can pretend this never happened, and he was never standing next to Bruce Wayne, Prince of Gotham, explaining how once, as a shitty street kid, he stole from the Dark Knight. \u201cCouldn\u2019t offload them. Everyone knew exactly where they came from. They thought they\u2019d get tracked, somehow, and anyone who touched them would end up in Arkham.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cArkham?\u201d Bruce tips his head to the side. \u201cNot Blackgate?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, they just figured\u2026\u201d Jason shrugs. \u201cI mean, anyone who stole the tires off the Batmobile is clearly a fucking lunatic.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cClearly,\u201d Bruce says, with a small, crooked smile. \u201cSo what did you do with the tires?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThrew \u2018em in the river,\u201d Jason says.

They blink when their eyes meet and then both of them find something else to look at. They turn, in unison, to Bruce Wayne, who looks more amused than the situation calls for.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell,\u201d Bruce says, \u201cit\u2019s good of you to come back.

He\u2019d be pissed about it, but, honestly, the pizza isn\u2019t bad, and it\u2019s not like Tony\u2019s going to stretch out the shirt.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They stay up late, watching the news, because Tony wants to see if they catch any sightings of Batman. Jason has to translate half of what the newscasters say, and he ends up drawing a map on the inside of the pizza box, just so Tony can orient himself to the stories.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Around two in the morning, Tony starts getting sleepy. \u201cI\u2019m not carrying you to your room,\u201d Jason tells him. \u201cYou fall asleep in here, and you\u2019re staying here.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh no,\u201d Tony mumbles, face pressed into Jason\u2019s pillow, \u201cnot into the briar patch.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAsshole,\u201d Jason says. He bustles tiredly around the room, putting things away, clearing the food out of the bed so Tony doesn\u2019t wake up covered in half-eaten pizza.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They\u2019ve slept in the same bed before. It happens. They travel, and they go to a lot of parties, and they\u2019re almost always out later than they should be, and Tony\u2019s got no Goddamn sense of personal boundaries.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They haven\u2019t done this since Christmas Eve, though, and Jason thinks maybe he shouldn\u2019t, now that things have changed. Maybe it\u2019s creepy now, where it used to just be kind of nice.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStop fucking around,\u201d Tony grumbles. \u201cTurn the lights out. Go to bed.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re in my bed,\u201d Jason tells him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, fuck off,\u201d Tony huffs back, and so Jason figures, you know, the hell with it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He ditches his shirt and climbs into bed. There\u2019s more than enough space for the two of them, and there\u2019s something comforting about having Tony this close, being able to hear him breathing. It\u2019s good, knowing he\u2019s safe.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey,\u201d Tony says, later, when Jason\u2019s so close to sleep that he isn\u2019t sure if this is the last bit of wakefulness or the first part of a dream. \u201cThanks for leaving all this. Your city.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGotham\u2019s got Batman,\u201d Jason mumbles back. It\u2019s not a complete thought, but the rest of it \u2013 and you needed me \u2013 isn\u2019t something he can say out loud. Anyway, he thinks he needs Tony just as much as Tony needs him. Maybe more. Probably more.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThanks,\u201d Tony says, again. He doesn\u2019t say anything else after that.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason starts training his replacements in March. There are five of them, but he figures, by the time training\u2019s over, there will just be a couple left. Tony mostly regards them with amusement. Every now and then, when Jason\u2019s got a pair of them tagging along to some outing, Tony will shoot him these tense, unsteady looks, like maybe he didn\u2019t fully buy it when Jason told him he was looking to add to the security team. But Tony never outright asks if Jason\u2019s thinking about leaving, so Jason never has to lie to his face.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It feels shitty, holding the knowledge in his head but not sharing it with Tony. But he wants to give the trainees six months of training, just to make sure they\u2019re ready, and Tony can get a bit overexcited about anything he reads as rejection. There\u2019s a chance that if he thinks Jason\u2019s eyeing the door, he\u2019ll orchestrate something to push Jason out faster.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So Jason keeps his mouth shut and tries not to do anything stupid, like kiss Tony right on the mouth when he comes stumbling out of the workshop after an all-night inventing bender, hair a mess, face flushed with victory, hands shaking from too much caffeine and nary a Goddamn nutrient in the past twelve hours. It\u2019s harder to resist than it should be. Sometimes, all Tony has to do is look across a room and smile, and, suddenly, Jason\u2019s brain just flips over and fizzles out.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s a problem.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey,\u201d Jason says, one day, when Tony\u2019s just escaped a board meeting and is slumped dejectedly in the back seat, drained of everything that isn\u2019t boredom and dismay. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a training exercise. Just you and me for the first round. Gotta check this company out before I let any of the kids try it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh yeah?\u201d Tony asks, barely stirring. \u201cTraining exercise?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMhm,\u201d Jason says. \u201cIncident training.\u201d He glances in the rearview mirror, catches Tony staring at him with a determined sort of blankness, like he\u2019s doing his best to concentrate but can\u2019t for the life of him figure out why. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna simulate a kidnapping attempt.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh.\u201d Tony thinks that over a second. \u201cAttempt?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason snorts. \u201cWell, they\u2019re sure as hell not gonna be successful.\u201d He pauses, shrugs. \u201cMaybe with the kids.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony grins, tired and still too drained to care much. \u201cGreat,\u201d he says. \u201cSounds fun.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s perfect. He doesn\u2019t suspect a single Goddamn thing.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The kidnapping simulation takes place in the last week of May, on a private island in the Bahamas. If Tony thinks it\u2019s weird that they\u2019re not trying this in a more urban environment, he doesn\u2019t say anything. They land at the private airstrip, drive to the rented house, and then Jason carries their bags inside. Tony gets too distracted trying to impress Jason with his tropical-themed bartending skills to notice that the whole situation is a little strange.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By day three, Tony\u2019s staring to get a little suspicious. \u201cHow long do they have?\u201d He asks, stirring some unholy combination of fruit juice and rum. He found the stash of tiny paper umbrellas two days ago, and he\u2019s been unrelenting with his use of them. \u201cAre you sure they didn\u2019t just forget us?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMaybe,\u201d Jason says. He checks his phone, sends a text. \u201cActually,\u201d he says, after a few seconds of watching Tony sipping at his newest creation, \u201cfuck this. Let\u2019s go find them.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony\u2019s eyebrows shoot upwards and then his expression settles into one of delighted mischief. \u201cThat\u2019s an option?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re making it an option.\u201d Jason slides his phone into his back pocket. \u201cC\u2019mon, Rambo, let\u2019s fuck shit up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony, it turns out, has always wanted to be Rambo. He commits to the exercise, fully and completely, without any hesitation. They sneak their way toward the beach, and Jason pretends to hear a noise, twice, just to watch the way Tony throws himself down and goes completely still and quiet, for the first time in the year and a half since Jason\u2019s known him. It\u2019s fucking adorable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By the time they make it to the beach, Tony\u2019s dirty and a little sweaty, and Jason\u2019s having a tough time looking at him, because he\u2019s ridiculously, unfairly beautiful. When they break through the overgrowth and make it to the beach, Tony goes still beside him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat,\u201d he says, \u201cthe fuck.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSurprise,\u201d Jason says. The last of the caterers are leaving the beach. One of them sets a final dish on the table and then hurries after the others.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs that a cake?\u201d Tony sounds completely lost. \u201cIs that dinner? What is this?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cKidnapping attempt was the first night,\u201d Jason says, shoving his hands in his pockets. \u201cI told you, there was never any chance it was going to be successful. I handled it while you were asleep.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony frowns at him, brow furrowing. \u201cSo we\u2019ve just been hanging out for two days? What the hell? Why would we\u2014holy shit.\u201d He hesitates, eyes skittering from the cake to Jason\u2019s face. \u201cDid you trick me into going on a vacation for my birthday?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason shrugs and tries not to look too smug. \u201cSure did,\u201d he says.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony stares at him, mouth hanging open, for a long moment. He looks at the table, then the beach, then back to Jason. \u201cShit,\u201d he says, visibly impressed. And then, immediately after that, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason blinks, too startled to say anything, and there\u2019s a horrible moment where he watches Tony hear what he just said and then shuffle through a whole series of emotions, none of which look particularly pleasant to experience.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFuck,\u201d he says, \u201cshit. I mean\u2014I meant\u2014I mean, shit. Fuck.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTony,\u201d Jason says, \u201cdon\u2019t freak out. It\u2019s fi--\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not fine. It\u2019s not fine!\u201d Tony throws his hands up, damn near smacks Jason in the face, which makes Jason wonder when they hell he moved so close. \u201cI mean, I do. Love you. Whatever. I just\u2014you\u2019re my employee, and I\u2019m your boss, and it\u2019s completely inappropriate, and I\u2019ve been paying you to be my friend for eighteen months, and I\u2019m a fucking disaster, and you did this whole thing for me, engaged in subterfuge and secrecy to surprise me, and I\u2014fuck. Can we just\u2014I\u2019m just drunk, is the problem.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony sips, aggressively, at the fruity cocktail he\u2019d carried with him, all the way from the house. \u201cI\u2019m shitfaced, Jason. Shitfaced, and sorry. Which is the title of my upcoming biopic, by the way. You can play yourself, if you want, since I assume you\u2019ll have a lot of free time, since you\u2019ll be fucking leaving. And I just---\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jason kisses him. He can\u2019t help it. Tony\u2019s done that thing where he just casually flips Jason\u2019s whole brain inside out, and the only thoughts he has in his head are kiss him and then Tony\u2019s voice, saying I love you.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony\u2019s still talking when Jason\u2019s mouth lands on his, so there\u2019s an awkward, scrambling moment, and then there\u2019s another, longer moment where Tony goes still, and Jason thinks fuck, abort, abort, but then Tony seems to figure out what\u2019s happening, and then, suddenly, finally, they\u2019re at the same place at the same time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony tastes like rum and pineapple juice, sweet and a little tart. He fists his hands in Jason\u2019s shirt so tight that Jason\u2019s not sure he could pull away, if he wanted it. If he ever wants to. He kisses him like it\u2019s all he ever wants to do in his life, and he\u2019s been waiting too Goddamn long to do it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey,\u201d Jason says, when they finally break apart to breathe. \u201cI\u2019m quitting.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony blinks up at him. His mouth folds down into a frown, so Jason kisses him again. And then again, until he gets a small, hesitant smile. And then once more after that, because he can\u2019t fucking help it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh,\u201d Jason says, \u201cand I love you, too. Since Christmas. It\u2019s been fucking distracting. I can\u2019t watch crowds when I\u2019m busy staring at your ass. You need to hire another bodyguard.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony\u2019s smile cracks open into one of those blinding grins, and Jason thinks, oh shit, it hasn\u2019t been since Christmas. It\u2019s been months longer than that. He thinks maybe he was doomed from the very beginning, from the moment Tony Stark invited him to get pancakes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo you\u2019re not leaving?\u201d Tony asks, hands still curled tight in Jason\u2019s shirt.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m quitting the job,\u201d Jason says, forehead resting against Tony\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m sure as hell not quitting you.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony blinks and then beams up at him, and then Jason has to kiss him again, and he hopes like hell all the caterers have fled the beach, because he\u2019s going to be pissed if any of this shows up online.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He\u2019ll have to figure all of this out, soon enough. What he\u2019s going to do, how long he\u2019ll need to stay on before the replacements are ready. He\u2019s not sure if he should move out or stay put or get his own place just to pretend like he\u2019ll be spending time there. He doesn\u2019t have any of those answers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They don\u2019t matter, right now. He\u2019ll figure everything out. They\u2019ve got this island for two more days.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He tugs Tony closer, pulls him in until their whole bodies are pressed together, and he keeps kissing him, works his mouth down to the edge of Tony\u2019s jaw, to his throat, to the soft skin right below the arch of his collarbone.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two of them have managed, somehow, to make this moment perfect. He\u2019ll figure out how they\u2019re going to manage the rest of the moments later."
