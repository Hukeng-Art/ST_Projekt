    "text": "The worst part of all the attacks that are constantly upon Luo Binghe, is how Shizun always protects him, even to this day. Ever since childhood, Shizun was always Binghe\u2019s defense against all hurt and pain, be it emotional and physical.\nWhen he was younger, Binghe couldn\u2019t fathom anything better than his beloved teacher proving his love like that, but now, as an adult and as a husband, the idea of Shizun being hurt because of his own ineptitude was\u2026 Agonizing, to say the least.\nShizun shouldn\u2019t have to be hurt in his stead.\nThis last one was a low-level demon who thought himself above the rules established by Lord Luo Binghe; he was dealt with accordingly, but that still didn\u2019t wake up Shizun. He remained gracefully, peacefully asleep, to everyone\u2019s horror.\nShizun had jumped and gotten hit by a spell, it seemed; he had fallen right there, to Binghe\u2019s arms like a maiden. Binghe researched the spell used, what it did, how to counter it; it ended up being a simple \u201ctrapped in a dream\u201d kind of spell, nothing worrisome, nothing lethal, so Binghe prepared himself to save his dear Shizun.\nEasier said than done; Binghe would have to enter Shizun\u2019s mind, go to the farthest point and drag him back to a conscious state, he\u2019d see much more than a regular dream would allow him, and all this without Shizun\u2019s clear consent, a terrible violation of Shizun\u2019s priced privacy. All things considered, Binghe was the most appropriate person for the job, who better to see your deepest secrets that your husband? But Shizun rarely spoke of the past, rarely spoke of himself. Binghe was curious and that made it all worse; he wanted to see, wanted to know, and now he had chance and excuse.\nEven so, he had to do it: he lay down beside Shen Qingqiu and let himself be placed in the right place to start.\n\u00a0\n(LEVEL 1)\n\u00a0\nBinghe opened his eyes and found himself inside their shared house, the sound of the wind blowing through the bamboo as it always was. It was all pretty and neat and functional, as Shizun\u2019s mind would obviously be.\nAt the desk, there was Shizun, working, but he raised his head when he saw him.\n\u201cBinghe, there you are! This teacher had been wondering where you\u2019d run off to.\u201d\n\u201cThis disciple\u2026 Is here now, shizun.\u201d He said vaguely. He was sure this wasn\u2019t the right Shizun but didn\u2019t know how to ask how to get to the next level. In someone else\u2019s mind, he might have just barged in and demanded, but this was Shizun, so he couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t do something so impolite.\n\u201cThat\u2019s very good, yes, Binghe is here, so all will be well now. All will be fixed; such is the power of the protagonist.\u201d The shizun sitting at the desk covered his face with his fan but his eyes were smiling.\n\u201cThe protagonist, Shizun?\u201d Shizun ignored his question.\n\u201cYes, yes, my little white lotus, but you need to keep moving. The door is right there.\u201d He pointed with the now-closed fan; Binghe bowed in thanks and walked through a door that had mysteriously appeared, he smiled to himself: \u201clittle white lotus\u201d, was that how shizun thought of him?\n\u00a0\n(LEVEL 2)\n\u00a0\nThis particular shizun was doing something completely bizarre: he was yelling at a mirror.\nWell, not a mirror, but a wall. Or a window? Binghe wasn\u2019t very sure what it was, but it was shiny and noisy and rude.\n\u201cWhat do you mean I can\u2019t say anything about my sister?!\u201d\n\u201cIf you do so, 50 points will be added to the \u201cHealthy Relationship\u201d chart, but the protagonist will lose 120 coolness points.\u201d\n\u201cThat difference is insane! What about my parents? Can\u2019t I mention them?\u201d\n\u201cIf you do so, 50 points will be added to the \u201cHealthy Relationship\u201d chart, but the protagonist will lose 160 coolness points.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is that even more, oh my god!\u201d Shizun threw his hands in the air as he spoke up. \u201cYou overpriced costumer service wanna-be, I hate you!\u201d\n\nHate? \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry to hear that, do you want to search for possible updates?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Shizun threw his hands over the window as if to quiet it. \u201cNo, no, no! We\u2019re fine like this! We\u2019re good!\u201d As he said so, he turned around and saw his disciple. \u201cAh, Binghe, I wasn\u2019t expecting you here\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d He pointed with a finger.\n\u201cI cannot tell you,\u201d Shizun said quickly.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cAny mention of the system will result in immediate termination of the contract.\u201d The window chimed in. Now closer, Binghe could see that, as it spoke, words appeared on it.\n\u201cYes, that.\u201d Shizun sighed as he brought fingers to his nose bridge. \u201c\u2019 Immediate termination of the contract\u2019,\u201d he mocked the thing\u2019s voice. \u201cHad I less to lose, I would not doubt any longer, but now, after the wedding, and, well, the relationship, and we\u2019re doing so well\u2026\u201d He, to Binghe\u2019s surprise, grabbed a lock of his precious hair and started twirling it nervously; it was one of the most emotional responses he\u2019d ever elicited in his Shizun (outside of their bed, of course, but those weren\u2019t as new as this one). \u201cBinghe,\u201d Shizun spoke up suddenly, bringing his attention back. \u201cThere are so many things I want to tell you, about myself, about my life, why I did and do certain things, but I cannot. It is not allowed. How I wished\u2026\u201d He trailed off.\nBinghe stared at this Shizun. He spoke less formally and with no fears, he was much more straightforward than what Binghe was used to. He knew this was, in some part, his own Shizun, and couldn\u2019t help but wonder, how would life be if his Shizun was like this all the time? How much closer would they be?\nShizun brought a palm to Binghe\u2019s cheek and rubbed gently with his thumb.\n\u201cBut even in these conditions, Binghe, never doubt my feelings for you. How deeply I care, how strong is my love, all these things will not change.\u201d\nBinghe was struck by the intensity behind those words, feeling some tears pool around his eyes. Hearing his beloved husband speak so freely, so sweetly\u2026 This spell was really a blessing in disguise.\n\u201cAh, there you go again\u2026\u201d Shizun smiled and pinched his cheek, earning a chuckle from his disciple. \u201cCry, cry, cry, you\u2019re always crying; sometimes I wonder how you never dehydrate.\u201d\n\u201cPlus 20 coolness points for the protagonist.\u201d The window (the System?) informed; Shizun rolled his eyes, the expression looking foreign in his beautiful face.\n\u201cI hate that thing; it gives me such headaches\u2026 Don\u2019t worry, Binghe, I\u2019ll deal with this, you carry on. Next door\u2019s over there.\u201d He pointed to a side, where another door had just appeared.\n\u201cMany thanks to Shizun.\u201d\n\u201cAiya, how terrible, after all we\u2019ve been through, won\u2019t you call me husband? I really do like it.\u201d His Shizun cocked his head with a mischievous grin.\n\u201cAnything husband wants.\u201d Binghe smiled back as Shen Qingqiu returned to his fight with the window.\n\u00a0\n(LEVEL 3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Binghe found himself in a burnt down Qing Jing Peak, their little bamboo house in ruins, the grass brittle and dry. Up ahead he could see Shizun and\u2026\nHimself.\nShizun and Luo Binghe in a place that he\u2019d never seen before, but in his nightmares.\nThe voice from the system that bullied Shizun in the former level spoke again, startling himself and Shen Qingqiu.\n\u201cGreetings. While the penalty is in progress, the system\u2019s other functions cannot be accessed. Hoping for your understanding and wishing you the best of luck.\u201d\n\nPunishment? Punishment for what?\n\nShizun cried out for him. Or, the other him.\n\u201cLuo Binghe!\u201d It warmed Binghe\u2019s heart that, in the face of danger, his husband called out for him. The other one of himself called back.\n\u201cShen Qingqiu?\u201d\nThat voice\u2026 Why was it so familiar? Despite being his, there were differences, and he was sure he\u2019d heard it before\u2026\nWhile he thought about it, the two people far from him started speaking. Their voices were too low for Binghe to hear, so he walked closer.\nHe got near enough to hear his other self call:\n\u201cCome here.\u201d Shizun did the opposite; he turned around and raced away. It reminded Binghe of the time when Shizun would run when he\u2019d just returned. He could also remember how easily he could catch up with Shizun.\n\u201cWhy are you running?\u201d The other Binghe asked gently, as he caught Shizun. \u201cI keep feeling as if\u2026 it seems like there\u2019s something different about you. You\u2019re really Shen Qingqiu?\u201d\nThe questions threw Binghe off his rhythm. Why shouldn\u2019t he be? Was there any other Shizun?\nHis blood seemed to freeze as he remembered their meeting with the murderous, trashy version of himself.\nHe could see, still clear as day, his husband\u2019s terror, how he had shaken under the other\u2019s hands. He could hear the other one\u2019s voice as he mocked Shizun for liking pain.\nPain\u2026 From the last time they met?\nCould this be\u2026\nIn that instant, the other Luo Binghe took his Shizun\u2019s hand a ripped his arm off.\nShizun didn\u2019t scream but Binghe did.\n\u201cShizun!\u201d He ran towards them, and as he did, he could hear his Shizun\u2019s scared gasps.\n\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2026\u201d He cried softly as the other Luo Binghe spoke again.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if this is my first time doing something like this. How is Shizun still so unaccustomed to it? Then, let\u2019s do it a few more times until you slowly get used to it. How about that?\u201d\nHe ripped off Shizun\u2019s leg too.\nThis time, Shizun did scream, and the sound was the most horrifying thing he had ever heard.\nThe System\u2019s cold, lifeless voice came from above them.\n\u201cThe punishment has finished.\u201d\nThe scene seemed to re-set itself: Shizun was standing, unharmed.\n\u201cLuo Binghe!\u201d He cried again, just like he had done just a few moments before. Binghe resumed his running. The scene seemed to go faster this time, or perhaps that was just Binghe\u2019s feeling of impotence. That bastard was hurting Shizun!\nHe got just in time to see the other Binghe rip Shizun\u2019s arm again.\nCloser now, he could hear the confused gasp his Shizun gave after losing his limb. Binghe took the opportunity of the bastard\u2019s distraction to steal Xin Mo from his waist and bury it in his chest in one fluid movement.\nThe other Binghe went down easy, much easier than Binghe would have thought. He didn\u2019t even move.\nHe kneeled beside Shizun as he gasped and mewled in pain.\n\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2026\u201d He mumbled again, but this time he wasn\u2019t interrupted, and he could hear Shizun\u2019s full thoughts. \u201cDon\u2019t do this with his face\u2026\u201d\nHow was it that Shizun didn\u2019t ask for the pain to stop, but for the aggressor to not be Luo Binghe?\u00a0\n\u201cShizun,\u201d he called as softly as he could. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, he\u2019s stopped, he will not hurt you anymore.\u201d\nShizun\u2019s eyes went to him, big and dark. His cheeks were drenched with tears and flushed red. He looked like this when Binghe took his time in their lovemaking too, but there was nothing alluring about it at the moment; Binghe could only see fear and pain in him.\n\u201cB-Binghe?\u201d\nBinghe poured energy into him, to slow the blood flow and lessen the pain. Gods, he couldn\u2019t even begin to think the amount of pain Shizun must be in\u2026\n\u201cYes, Shizun, your Binghe is here.\u201d\n\u201cBinghe\u2026\u201d Shizun whimpered again. \u201cPlease- Please don\u2019t-\u201c\n\u201cThe punishment has finished.\u201d The System said, and the scene re-set again. Binghe was still on the floor and Shizun was on his feet again, calling out to his aggressor. He was on his way to wreck the other Luo Binghe, destroy him completely as many times as he could, before catching sight of a door on his right.\nRight\u2026 This was not real.\nIt was a memory or a nightmare, but there was nothing Binghe could realistically do to stop it. He steeled his nerves; he had to keep moving and finish what he\u2019d started; to protect Shizun he had to\u2026\nHad to\u2026\nIgnore the screams of agony of his most important person.\n\u201cThe punishment has finished.\u201d\nThe scene reset itself and Binghe walked through the door.\nHe\u2019d ask about this later.\n\u00a0\n(LEVEL 4)\n\u00a0\nIf the last level had been bad, this was officially the worst.\nIt was all exactly as he remembered: the scent of blood and heated rock, the breeze blowing away some of the fire sparks that might hurt his skin, the darkness of the scene\u2026\nThe last time he\u2019d been here he was but a child, and Shizun threw him into the Abyss.\nHe would have remained frozen in his spot had it not been, again, for Shizun.\nHe was kneeling at the very edge as if looking down, were he not covering his face with his hands. He was shaking, his whole body trembling from sobs.\nSobs?\n\u201cShizun?\u201d He walked his way, mindful of the cliff. He really didn\u2019t want to get close but Shizun was right there. He had to get him away. \u201cShizun\u2026\u201d\nHe crouched next to him, keeping his body leveled and turned from the Abyss. He put a hand on Shizun\u2019s back and it shook with his teacher\u2019s movement. The cries that left him were heart-wrenching. They came from deep and left him breathless, gasping painfully. Binghe rubbed softly.\n\u201cShizun, the edge\u2026\u201d\nShizun raised his head and looked at him, not even bothering to clean his face. It was such a different picture to the usual elegant, aloof master, but it wasn\u2019t one Binghe wanted to keep seeing. He curled his arm protectively along Shizun\u2019s torso and pulled to take him away from the precipice.\nShizun squirmed in his arms.\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d he clawed in the direction of the dangerous edge, his voice rough with pain. \u201cNo, he\u2019s in there, I have to-\u201c\nBinghe froze again.\n\u2018He?\u2019\nDid he mean Binghe?\n\u201cI should have- I couldn\u2019t-\u201c Shizun mumbled, still fighting. Binghe tightened his grip. Even as an illusion, it\u2019d do them no good if Shizun fell down too.\n\u201cShizun, it\u2019s dangerous, let\u2019s-\u201c get away from the edge, was what Binghe would say but it only furthered Shizun\u2019s panic.\n\u201cI know! I know! It\u2019s so dangerous! There\u2019s Ghost-Headed Spiders and Hell Dogs, and, and-\u201c He was panting again, his words becoming dangerously breathless.\n\u201cAlright, Shizun, alright, we will not move, breathe\u2026\u201d He released his arms a little bit, but Shizun wasn\u2019t listening, he just kept talking.\n\u201cHow could I? He\u2019s- He\u2019s just a kid! I just- I threw him down there!\u201d\n\u201cShizun,\u201d Binghe rubbed between his shoulder blades worryingly. \u201cShizun, breathe. He will be fine, he will survive.\u201d\nHe had, after all. He had lived through the worst that hellish place had to offer, fought his way out of a number of situations, learned so much in so little time, moved only by the desire to see Shizun again.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf any version of Luo Binghe was down there, he\u2019d definitely make it back to their master.\n\u201cI know he will survive!\u201d Shizun yelled in his ear, startling Binghe again. He knew? \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t make it right! He didn\u2019t deserve it! He\u2019s just a kid! When he returns-\u201c He stilled suddenly. Binghe was extremely worried right now. Being an illusion, shouldn\u2019t mind-Shizun be more level headed? Less worried about real events?\n\u201cHe\u2019ll kill me,\u201d Shizun mumbled.\n\u201cWhat? Who?\u201d\n\u201cBinghe, when he returns, oh god,\u201d Shizun answered, and Binghe blinked. What? \u201cOh god, he\u2019ll kill me, I ruined it, I ruined it all, god, no, please, no\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShizun-\u201c \u00a0\nKill him? Why would-\nBinghe thought of the other Luo Binghe ripping Shizun\u2019s extremities, and Shizun running away from him when he first had returned.\nIt seemed his fears weren\u2019t entirely unfounded.\n\u201cBinghe, please, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have- I should- oh, god\u2026\u201d He resumed his weeping with fat tears, digging his nails into his forehead as he covered his face. Tiny \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019s left his lips in small gasps.\nBinghe couldn\u2019t do anything more than stay and try to process what he\u2019d just heard.\nThis place was memories and thoughts mixed together, this scene was probably not what happened, there was no chance of him breaking down like that, ever, but what Shizun felt or feels regarding\u2026 the incident.\u00a0\nThere was\u2026 a lot of guilt. Binghe thought he knew his master, his husband, but apparently, his knowledge was barely the tip of the iceberg.\nHe heard a ping, like a little bell, above them.\nThe System-Window was back.\n\u201cCongratulations! You have successfully completed the important mission \u2018Beginning of the Legend: Luo Binghe\u2019s Fall and Rebirth.\u2019 Rewarding Protagonist\u2019s Coolness level 10,000.\u201d\nBinghe went through the words methodically, slowly; the System had wanted Binghe to fall? No, how to explain it? The system-\n\u201cBut also due to special circumstances, there is a newly calculated score: Luo Binghe\u2019s Heartbreak level. Because the heartbreak value is too high, the protagonist's coolness is cleared to 0. Please continue your efforts!\u201d\n\u2018Your efforts,\u2019 it said and he understood.\nThe System-spirit had made Shen Qingqiu throw him.\u00a0\nHis husband was a kind, caring person, who was controlled by a System to stop him from speaking his mind and revealing more than a handful of things.\nWas that why Shizun always seemed so vague? He could recall every single time Shizun had said something he couldn\u2019t quite understand, simply saving it in his heart; had that been Shen Qingqiu\u2019s way of telling him things?\nHe could picture Shen Qingqiu\u2019s eyes before he fell into the Abyss: colder than he\u2019d ever seen them, fine jade sharp enough to cut through glass, or through his heart.\nHe remembered words, too:\n\n\u201cThis master doesn\u2019t want to kill you.\u201d \n\nHe hadn\u2019t fully believed them, then. Shizun had seemed so cruel; but hadn\u2019t he been the cruel one?\nHis question of Shizun\u2019s intentions, at the time, made sense to him, but in retrospective, it would be like an emotional string being pulled too harshly. His Shizun, being forced to go against his own disciple, one he favored (Binghe wasn\u2019t stupid, he knew his years with Shizun were especially good), it must have broken his heart.\nShizun\u2019s voice brought him from his train of thought.\n\u201cGo scram,\u201d he garbled along with some tears. \u201cFucker System, fucking scram!\u201d He raised his head to scream angrily at the window. \u201cYou were supposed to help him!\u201d\nThe System-spirit was supposed to? Well, it didn\u2019t do a very good job, Binghe had-\nHe had-\nHe had been in terrible danger, again and again, and he had come up safe and sound.\nHadn\u2019t Shizun said it too? When he promised to protect him? Nothing could harm Luo Binghe. Ever.\nIt was the System\u2019s doing then, but Shizun had to earn it with those points, whatever they were. And he had won them and lost them with such little care from the spirit\u2026\nShizun was always doing whatever he could do for him\u2026 He just never knew how much.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d Shizun muttered, sounding far from his usual, royal self. His tone was childish, pouty even. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, I worked so hard to- It\u2019s not- You can\u2019t-\u201c He whined.\nBinghe felt love for Shizun invade him. Poor Shizun, trying so hard to help, it was always like this. The world was not a terribly kind place; you could only hope to make it better.\nMake it better\u2026 Oh, Binghe should keep moving too.\nHe still wasn\u2019t at the bottom of Shizun\u2019s mind, he could feel there was more. But where was the door?\nThe Abyss made a rumbling noise and Binghe shivered. He had loathed the fall\u2026.\nOh. Oh.\nHe\u2019d have to jump again.\nFalling as a child, he was confused and scared. He had not known many things he now did. Now he had explanations, ways to defend himself, and the love of a husband.\nHis husband, his Shizun, who was willing to go ahead and love him, to follow the instruction of a cruel spirit to protect him, who managed to overcome his own fear when Binghe couldn\u2019t even see the truth in front of him.\nHe wanted to cry, hold his husband close and tell him again and again \u2018Shizun, this disciple was wrong, this husband was wrong!\u2019\nHe pressed a kiss to Shen Qingqiu\u2019s temple and let go of him in favor of leaning into the Abyss. It didn\u2019t look like such a big fall from here\u2026 He probably could even land on his feet.\nA pair of hands grabbed his tunic, and he turned his head.\n\u201cBinghe?\u201d Shizun was holding on to him, big eyes still wet.\n\u201cShizun, this disciple needs to finish some errands.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t jump.\u201d Shizun ignored him. \u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d\nOh, this was going to hurt.\n\u201cThis one apologizes, but this Luo Binghe needs to finish the errand.\u201d He still needed to save Shizun. And then he\u2019d pamper his dear, dear husband in every way he could.\nBinghe rid himself of Shizun\u2019s hands as he smiled at him. \u2018All will be well\u2019, he wanted to say. \u00a0It didn\u2019t seem Shizun thought so; he was mumbling as he tried to reach back to him.\n\u201cBinghe, no, no, listen to me, don\u2019t jump, don\u2019t go, please, do not-\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, Shizun.\u201d\nBinghe jumped.\nThe air around him didn\u2019t hide Shizun\u2019s raw scream of his name.\n\u00a0\n(LEVEL FIVE)\n\u00a0\nHe fell into his very own Qing Jing Peak, the sun shining, the sweet smell of the summer breeze filled his senses. It was like a painting of his childhood, a dream\u2026\nHe could hear someone talking inside of Shizun\u2019s house! Time to go inside, then.\nHe walked leisurely, he was pretty deep into Shizun\u2019s mind, he could tell. The jump had been an extraordinary feat, he had saved lots of time.\nHe was glad he\u2019d done it.\nHe knocked on the door.\n\u201cShizun?\u201d No one answered. Guess he\u2019d let himself inside\u2026 \u201cShizun, I\u2019m coming in\u2026\u201d\nHe opened to see his Shizun standing in the middle of the living room, walking around like he did when he was stressed and he allowed himself to express it.\n\u201cFuck, fuck, fuck, fuck\u2026.\u201d He was mumbling. Binghe stared wide-eyed; he\u2019d never heard Shizun curse so openly\u2026 Of course, he\u2019d made Shizun gasp some during the nights they lay together, but this was\u2026 Interesting! And new!\nIt was incredibly funny to him how much Shizun cursed inside his mind. He\u2019d love to convince him of doing so on the outside too\u2026\n\u201cFuuuuck me, fuck thiiiis\u2026\u201d Shizun groaned and Binghe squealed. Shizun turned to him and he held his breath, biting his lip to hide his smile.\n\u201cWhat the actual fuck is wrong with these people?\u201d Shizun asked, his voice distraught.\n\u201cShizun?\u201d He cocked his head.\n\u201cCan you believe this absolute bastard? That Shen QingQiu, that-! Can you believe the amount of child and domestic abuse they allow? My god, don\u2019t even get me started with the human rights violations! If there were someone who\u2019d only- God! That little sheep! No wonder he- But by God, that man is a monster!\u201d He shook his finger at Binghe.\n\u201cThat man\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not even worth calling a man! He\u2019s an animal, he\u2019s a-\u201c he snapped his fingers until he found a word he liked and snarled it. \u201cA beast.\u201d Binghe suddenly remembered his childhood, when Shizun still hadn\u2019t liked him very much, how he used to be called \u2018little beast\u2019.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Shizun kept talking, mostly to himself it seemed. \u201cYes, that beast, that horrible, horrible teacher, at least he\u2019s gone now!\u201d\n\u201cShen QingQiu is gone?\u201d\n\u201cAnd good riddance to him! But don\u2019t you worry, I got this! It can\u2019t be that hard, can it? It\u2019s just transmigration, totally normal, super fucking okay. I just have to\u2026 to\u2026\u201d He whined. \u201cChange fate.\u201d\nHe sat down slowly and Binghe followed suit.\n\u201cUgh, can you believe this? I just got myself in soooo much trouble, fuuuuuck.\u201d Shizun leaned down to press his forehead against the table but perked up suddenly. \u201cAt least I\u2019m healthy now!\u201d\n\u201cShizun\u2026 wasn\u2019t healthy?\u201d To Binghe\u2019s surprise, Shizun slapped his arm playfully.\n\u201cWho\u2019s your Shizun? I\u2019m like, a year older than you, fuck off!\u201d He laughed and Binghe was as charmed as he was confused. \u201cThough\u2026 I guess I am Shizun now\u2026 Luo Binghe\u2019s Shizun\u2026 The good Shizun, of course! Oh, I\u2018m so excited,\u201d he gushed at Binghe, giggling. \u201cI bet he\u2019s the fucking cutest shit. He\u2019s gotta be, right?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so\u2026\u201d Binghe had never thought himself a cute kid. He looked unruly and half-starved. Only after spending years in Shizun\u2019s care had he looked half decent.\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t you dare bad-mouth my little white sheep.\u201d Shizun threatened with a finger. \u201cLuo Binghe is yet to become a Black Wolf Demon King of Terror and Seduction, and I will not stand- No, this Shen Yuan will not stand for such mistreatment where it is not yet due!\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cBlack\u2026 what?\u201d\n\u201cAnd hopefully never! Can you imagine a less psychotic Luo Binghe?\u201d Shizun, Shen Yuan, not-Shen-QingQiu, leaned in smiling. \u201cA Binghe who doesn\u2019t want to murder everyone? One who can choose and love a single woman, or at least reduce his three-hundred-beauties harem to double digits? I honestly can\u2019t believe I get to fix all of Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky\u2019s mistakes! Take that, shitty author!\u201d He punched the air victoriously and cackled, while Binghe had to take a moment to go through all he had just heard.\n\u201cShen Yuan?\u201d He called and the man looked at him.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYou are Shen QinQiu?\u201d\n\u201cFrom today on, yes. No more Shen Yuan. It\u2019s over, it\u2019s done, finito. I am Shizun, now. And I\u2019ll do my job. I promise you.\u201d He looked into Binghe\u2019s eyes so earnestly, so sweetly. Binghe couldn\u2019t help but melt like butter on a pan. \u201cI will take care of Binghe.\u201d\n\u201cI will trust Shizun, then.\u201d Binghe smiled back, touched by this man\u2019s, his husband\u2019s love. All these discoveries\u2026 They were driving him crazy; he\u2019d need more than a moment of quiet to work through all he\u2019d learned, but he was happy.\n\u201cOh, is that door for you?\u201d The new Shen QinQiu asked, eyeing behind Binghe. He turned and indeed, his next-door was there.\n\u201cMn. I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201d As Binghe closed the door behind him, he heard Yue Qing Yuan\u2019s voice, worriedly asking his \u201cdear Xiao Jiu\u201d how he felt.\nIf only he knew.\n\u00a0\n(LEVEL SIX)\n\u00a0\nThis was a far as he could be, Binghe felt it as soon as he entered. The most stable place, and the strangest. This was as back as he would see, memories-wise.\nThis was a white room that beeped. The smell was clean but it burned his nose, and the noise was just as harsh on his ears. For a moment, he feared it was the System-Spirit again, but the boxes around the place seemed different from the floating window. They looked heavy and dense, and they were connected like vines to a figure sitting up in a bed.\nBinghe stared at him; he was a young man he had never seen, lithe and frail-looking, incredibly pale with big shadows under his eyes. His short hair complemented the unhealthy look; Binghe felt uncomfortable at the thought of being connected to the boxes like he was.\nHe walked towards him, wondering who this person was to his Shizun.\n\u201cForgive this one but, who are you?\u201d The young man seemed amused by the question.\n\u201cShen Yuan,\u201d the man stared up at him, having to tilt his head back quite a bit.\n\u201cShen Yuan.\u201d Like\u2026 Shizun\u2019s last memory. The other one had said he was unhealthy and this\u2026 This certainly was it. \u201cYou\u2019re Luo Binghe.\u201d He carried on. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\n\u201cShizun was hit by a spell. I need to pull him back.\u201d\n\u201cMn, makes sense.\u201d He nodded, seriously. \u201cBinghe is very nice to do this.\u201d\n\u201cShizun is this one\u2019s husband. There is nothing this Luo Binghe will not do for him.\u201d\n\u201cI really lucked out.\u201d Shen Yuan sighed, then coughed. Binghe could hear his lungs trashing and his throat constricting; it was a horrible sound that got him in alert. Shen Yuan waved his tenseness away. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine, just- This happens a lot.\u201d He breathed a couple of times. \u201cI suppose Binghe has questions.\u201d\nBinghe nodded.\n\u201cShen Yuan is this person.\u201d He waved at him and the bed-ridden man nodded. \u201cAnd Shen Yuan is Shen QingQiu, my Shizun, and husband.\u201d Another nod. \u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cI am- I have never been very healthy, not like you cultivators with your qi and your flying swords and shit.\u201d He began. \u201cSo, I read, and when I died, I ended up taking Shen QingQiu\u2019s body.\u201d\n\u201cShen Yuan died?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He propped his head. \u201cNasty business, minus two out of ten, would not recommend. And I have experience with that.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026 are Shizun. You have those memories.\u201d\n\u201cDuh,\u201d the man smirked. \u201cI am the basest part of him. Have you ever read psychology?\u201d\n\u201cI- This one does not-\u201c\n\u201cOh, right, xianxia and all that stuff. I think you\u2019d like it. Anyway, I\u2019m at the deepest part of his subconscious, so like, I guess you could say I\u2019m the real him, somehow. The one who knows everything.\u201d As he said the last word, he moved his fingers like doing magic tricks. \u201cI think you can wake him, us, now. You\u2019ve rattled enough chains, we\u2019re all up.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re all up,\u201d Binghe repeated, unsure.\n\u201cYep. We were all asleep, and you\u2019ve come to wake us up. Now that you\u2019ve done it, the mission is over, you know how it is. You\u2019ve finished the nerve-wracking mission, yay!\u201d He said nasally, mocking someone\u2019s voice. \u201cCongratulations, congratulations, congratulations! Important things must be said three times!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the System-spirit.\u201d\n\u201cYou can just call it \u2018the System\u2019, or absolute-jerk-bastard-IT-guy\u2019s-nightmare. We\u2019ll find that super funny.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, then. I\u2019ll take my leave?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d Binghe stared at the figure dismissing him. He could barely believe his eyes. This was Shizun, in some way. How painful\u2026\n\u201cOi, I can sense your guilt from here. It\u2019s not your fault, it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. Just\u2026 Go back, okay? He\u2019ll be waking up soon, and we\u2019d rather you be there. We always like it when you\u2019re there.\u201d\nBinghe nodded softly, feeling tears pool in his eyes.\n\u201cAiyah, crying again\u2026\u201d Shen Yuan, Shizun, sighed with a smile. \u201cWhatever will I do with you?\u201d\nBinghe smiled at him as the dream fell to dust around him.\n\u00a0\n(LEVEL ZERO)\n\u00a0\nBinghe opened his eyes slowly, feeling Shizun next to him on their bed. Back at the bamboo house, with the sweet sound of the wind through the leaves.\nShizun groaned softly, finally awoken.\n\u201cBinghe?\u201d He called.\n\u201cShizun,\u201d Binghe called back, his voice thick with feeling.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Shizun spoke through a yawn, forgetful of his mysterious persona when sleep still clung to him. \u201cI had the strangest dream\u2026 Are you crying?\u201d\nBinghe sniffled as an answer. Shen Yuan, Shen QingQiu, Shizun, was back.\nHusband turned to him in a second, raising his hand to Binghe\u2019s cheek to wipe away the tears.\n\u201cAiyah,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWhatever will I do with you?\u201d\nBinghe smiled as he leaned in and hid his face in Shizun\u2019s chest. \u00a0"
