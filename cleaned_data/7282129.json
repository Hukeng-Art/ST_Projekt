Heroes and neighbours and fellow students rain down on the Parker house, ready to defend her.'</p>",

    "text": "May hates crying in front of other people, but she can\u2019t stop the sobs building in her chest.\nThe cafe is loud. Everyone had fallen silent at first, shocked into this awful, bewildered quiet, but as the footage wore on, as the boy\u2019s struggles grew weak and his chest heaved, face caked in drying blood, the watching crowd grew louder. With each closed fist struck across the boy\u2019s face, each time fingers grabbed and tugged at his knotted hair, the people cried out, indignant and horrified at once.\nIn any other circumstance, May might\u2019ve been touched by their righteous anger. Now, she only feels\u00a0numb. Her gaze is\u00a0fixed on the feverish sheen on the teenager\u2019s sweaty face; his scrunched, embarrassed eyes; the red of his teeth and lips, where he\u2019d bitten into his captor\u2019s hand and swallowed a mouthful of vicious, coppery blood.\nThis is May\u2019s boy. This is Peter, chained and beaten. May\u2019s Peter.\nOf all the things May had expected from the busy lunch rush-hour, this wasn\u2019t it. She thought she\u2019d been having a nightmare when the TV in the corner of the cafe had crackled to life, and Spider-Man\u2019s unmasked face had swum into view.\nMay presses her hands tightly against her mouth. She\u2019s shaking, sobbing, face blotchy and wet in the middle of the cafe.\nNo one pays her any mind; they\u2019re too enthralled by the image onscreen.\n\u201cSay your name.\u201d Peter shows his red teeth to the person offscreen. They sigh, as if they\u2019re disappointed. As if they are going to get any other reaction from May\u2019s brave, unwavering boy. \u201cWe\u2019d stop hitting you if you co-operated.\u201d\n\u201cl\u2019m just offended, is all,\u201d Peter says in that snarky hero voice May doesn\u2019t get to hear very often. His teeth are bared in a smile rather than a snarl, now. \u201cI got all prettied up for you, and you forget my name mid-date? That\u2019s rude is what it is, you\u2019ve got me thinking you\u2019re uninterested or someth\u2014\u201d\nThe slap is open-handed. The sound echoes through the cafe\u2019s old TV, and May flinches with her entire body. A bitten off shout comes from her left. When May\u2019s eyes skitter away from the image of her panting nephew, she spots a construction worker, presumably on his lunch break, hunched over a table. His hands are balled into fists, every line of his body tightly wound, eyes burning up at the TV.\nShe casts another glance around the room; everyone is similarly tense, pulled taunt by disgust, or horror, or shock. Or anger. May has never seen an angrier crowd.\n\u201cI thought you wanted me to talk,\u201d Peter says loudly, and May\u2019s gaze snaps back to her baby. \u201cGiving me mixed-signals here, man.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay your name. Say it.\u201d\n\nPeter pretends to think about it, mouth screwed up, eyes flicking to the ceiling in mock-contemplation. \u201cHm,\u201d he says at last, \u201cnah. I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d\nA hand snakes out and fists in his hair. A whine escapes the teenager\u2019s throat, slipped out involuntarily as the vulnerable column of his neck is exposed to the camera.\n\n\u201cEnough games. We were going to be kind if you co-operated, but it seems you\u2019re too stupid to go down without some stupid remark, Peter.\u201d\n\nPeter\u2019s eyes snap open. He tries to dislodge the hand from his hair, but he only manages to shake the chains binding him. The fist tugs him closer, pulls tighter, offering no reprieve.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you are,\u201d says the man offscreen. \u201cPeter Benjamin Parker. Age sixteen. Attending Midtown High School, living in Forest Hills, Queens. Spider-Man is a born and bred New Yorker; I think no one is surprised.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Peter says.\n\n\u201cWe offered you mercy, Peter. You denied it. New York watched you deny it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t, I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s enough. We don\u2019t need to do anything more\u2014the criminal underbelly will do the rest.\u201d Heavy, offscreen footsteps. The clanking of chains. The camera wobbles as someone fiddles with it.\nPeter recoils in his bindings. His eyes are wide, his shoulders stiff. His mouth falls open to take in shallow, rattling breaths.\n\n\u201cSay goodbye to the camera, Peter.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, Peter looks the camera dead on, and pleads, words tumbling, \u201cMy Aunt. Please, my Aunt\u2014my Aunt May\u2014don\u2019t let anything happen to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d\n\n\u201cMay Parker.\u201d Peter hadn\u2019t cried when they\u2019d struck him. His eyes hadn\u2019t watered when they\u2019d twisted his fingers the wrong way, when they waggled a knife under his nose like a promise. But now, the camera shaking as someone struggles to switch it off, Peter is trembling, voice hitched, huge eyes threateningly wet. \u201cHer name is May Parker, and she\u2019s the only family I have left\u2014\u201d\nThe camera shuts off. The television fades to black.\nThe cafe rings with hollow silence, and then\u2014\n\u201cThose motherfuckers!\u201d The construction worker jumps up. He gestures at the TV. \u201cA fucking kid, they were\u2014were\u2014\u201d\nHalf the cafe is on their feet. People pull their phones out, turn to one another, shouting voices clambering to be heard over the din. May stands frozen in the middle of it all. Her cardigan is pulled on over her waitress uniform, but she feels cold, and alone, and achingly hollow.\nHer baby is in the hands of those monsters. Her baby, bleeding and shaking under the hands of someone who wants to see him dead. Peter is all May has left, too.\nHer sobs are full body, starting in her sternum and crawling up her chest. She\u2019s gasping with each ragged, trembling inhale. She must look like a mess. She\u2019s never cared less.\n\u201cMay!\u201d Her colleague is beside her. Kayleen is barely in her twenties, short and plump with normally red, flushed cheeks. Now, she looks pale and shaky, like she\u2019s once again forgotten to take her penicillin.\nMay tries to say something, but she can\u2019t. Her sobs stop her from speaking.\n\u201cTake deep breaths,\u201d Kayleen says, hands on May\u2019s shoulders, keeping her upright.\nMarie appears by Kayleen\u2019s side. The two waitresses work to steady May.\n\u201cShe needs to sit down,\u201d Marie instructs, jaw set. She turns to the neighbouring table, where a group of college kids are sitting. They\u2019re all staring at May. \u201cWe need a seat.\u201d\n\u201cOh! Yeah, yes.\u201d A boy jumps out of his seat, dragging it to May\u2019s side. He looks barely out of his teens, red hair coifed and gelled, a worried slant to his lips.\nHere, surrounded by people decades younger than her, May is only reminded of Peter. Her sobs deepen. She collapses into the seat, legs unable to hold her up.\nKayleen\u2019s clammy hands tangles in her\u2019s. \u201cMay, May\u2014you need to calm down.\u201d\nMay shakes her head. Marie takes her other hand. The college students are still staring.\n\u201cHey!\u201d A businessman shouts over the messy array of seats and tables. \u201cJust because there\u2019s more superhero drama, doesn\u2019t mean the day stops still.\u201d Impatient fingers are snapped at the trio of waitresses. \u201cMy lunch break finishes soon\u2014are you paid to stand around or actually take some orders?\u201d\n\u201cHey, have some respect,\u201d demands the redheaded boy who\u2019d given May his seat.\n\u201cI have to be at work in twenty minutes. I\u2019m a paying customer, when I come here expecting service, I should get service\u2014\u201d\nMay can feel Kayleen\u2019s fingers shaking against her own. Marie looks furious, but bites out, \u201cSomeone will be with you soon, sir.\u201d\nWhen neither girls leave May\u2019s side, the man in his cheap suit continues, \u201cDon\u2019t spout that placating bullshit at me\u2014\u201d\nThey have the entire cafe\u2019s attention, now. The confrontation is spoken across heads, across seated tables. Everyone still looks shaken, none more than May, but the ensuing argument draws them in.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if some dumb kid from Queens got himself into trouble; you think I pay taxes so some teenager can put on tights and piss criminals off? My life doesn\u2019t revolve around a reckless kid who got what was coming to him\u2014\u201d\nFresh, scorching anger ripples through the New Yorkers who\u2019d just watched their local hero unmasked and tortured. May can hear the gasps from the students behind her. Marie\u2019s hand clenches into fists. The construction worker bristles, the people around them scowling.\nBut it\u2019s May that stands on wobbly legs. It\u2019s May, face still blotchy and red, voice a shaky, wild thing, that looks this man in the eye, and says, \u201cHow dare you.\u201d\n\u201cMay,\u201d Kayleen tries, springing up. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d May agrees, \u201che doesn\u2019t.\u201d The man\u2019s eyes roll beneath his flattened hair. May grits her teeth. \u201cA teenage boy who has given so much to protect this city\u2014the city you live in\u2014was just beaten and tortured. He works so hard to make some kind of difference. He\u2019s kind, and strong, and he\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s\u2014\u201d Her anger fizzles out. The grief is back, a familiar friend, pressing wet, prickling tears in her eyes and making her voice crack. \u201cHe\u2019s just a boy. Peter\u2019s just\u2014just a boy\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMay!\u201d Kayleen cries, hands fluttering.\n\u201cNobody cares about your lunch break, or your irrelevant office job, or how important you think you are,\u201d May says. Her words crackle and drip under her tears, and tremble with blistering, protective rage. \u201cAnd you have no right to talk about my kid like that!\u201d\nShe chokes on a sob. There are so many people staring, now. The businessman looks at her like he\u2019s been struck, mouth opening and closing like a fish. If it were any other time, May would be embarrassed about crying so openly and so furiously in front of a crowd. Making a spectacle, Ben would say.\nThe redheaded boy steps forward. He wets his lips, and asks, \u201cM\u2019am, are you\u2026 are you May Parker?\u201d\nMay jerks her head in a nod. The redhead looks to his friends; they look back, mouths open.\n\u201cOh, my god,\u201d says the businessman. A flush rises over his cheeks. Customers scoot away from him as though he\u2019s contaminated, filthy, and he ducks his head under their reproving stares.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Marie decides, \u201cwe have to go. We have to go now, May.\u201d\n\u201cGo?\u201d May echoes. \u201cMy house\u2014\u201d\nMarie grabs her shoulder tightly. \u201cMay, do not go home.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere else. And Peter\u2026\u201d Almost irrationally, she aches for their tiny home in Queens. She wants to run there and huddle in the kitchen, where she always waits, patiently, for him to come home. She wants to stay there, huddled in their tiny kitchen, as if he\u2019d only gone out to fetch eggs and she was waiting for his return so she could start dinner.\nMay falls back into the chair, throat tight. \u201cGod. Peter.\u201d\nKayleen drops to a crouch beside her, murmuring soft, nonsensical things as she rubs warm circles into the back of May\u2019s hand. The tiny motions are like an anchor\u2014something for May to concentrate on beyond the bustling, stressed noise of the cafe and the erratic thumping of her heart.\n\u201cWe have to get her somewhere safe,\u201d Marie says.\n\u201cMy place?\u201d Kayleen suggests.\n\u201cYou live with your parents, and it\u2019s too far away. My apartment is ages away, too.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe the police station?\u201d someone interrupts.\n\u201cAfter that business with Fisk? I wouldn\u2019t trust Spidey\u2019s family with a building full of cops. Who knows how many might be corrupt\u2014\u201d\nDiscussion blooms from surrounding tables. May bites at her lip, and tries to filter out the clabbering voices. There are so many eyes on her, and her cheeks are still wet, her make up probably running. Kayleen presses closer to her. Marie hovers above them both, reassuring, protective.\nThe front of the shop explodes open in a spray of debris.\nThe force knocks May headfirst into the ground. Her temple collides with the cafe\u2019s hard, tiled floor. Broken wood blankets her legs. When she wobbles to her elbows, shifting beneath the shards of furniture, blood drips into her eyes. The world tilts. Spins. It\u2019s been years since May had a concussion this violent.\nA hand grabs her by the elbow, tugging her to her feet. She\u2019s shoved, guided, past the scrambling masses of people, past the half-destroyed cafe counter, past the obnoxious flares of yellow and red towering over the wreckage\u2014Shocker, she\u2019ll find out later\u2014and out into the New York sunlight.\nHer white tennis shoes aren\u2019t meant to run in a disorientated sprint, but May has no choice. She\u2019s caught in a stampede of panicking bodies, lost in the chaos. Strong hands grip onto her forearms, keeping her up. She lists to one side, wheezing into someone\u2019s chest. Her legs are swept up from under her just as she\u00a0passes out.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe wakes to the soft hum of the radio. Her body is slack against cheap cotton sheets. The pillow wedged under her cheek smells faintly of vodka.\n\u201cShe\u2019s awake!\u201d\nMay blinks up at a trio of nervous young adults staring intently down at her. She rubs grit out of her eyes, wets her lips, and mutters, \u201cWhy does my pillow smell like vodka?\u201d\nOne of them colours and buries his burning cheeks in his hands. From behind his fingers, he blurts, \u201cOh, my god! Mrs. Parker, we had this party a few nights ago, and I forgot to wash my sheets, and\u2014and I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d\nMay might be disorientated with a headache pounding behind her eyes, but she knows how to handle teenagers. She takes his hand, patting it gently. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I was the same when I was your age.\u201d\nThe bed she\u2019s sitting on is a high bunk bed. The room is tiny, hardly half the size of May\u2019s bedroom, cluttered with dirty laundry, a desk shoved against the back wall. The window is shut, curtains pulled firmly shut. The only light comes from the christmas lights that drip from the bunk-bed\u2019s metal frame. It illuminates the glossy sheen of laminated posters; of cans piled up in the wire trashcan; of the awe shining in the kids before her.\nShe struggles to sit up. The bedsprings groan under her shifting weight.\n\u201cMrs. Parker, you still have a concussion. You should rest!\u201d\nMay fixes her best unimpressed look at the girl. She ducks under it, fringe peeking into her eyes. Startlingly, it reminds her of Peter.\n\u201cYou all seem to know who I am,\u201d she begins, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know who any of you are.\u201d\nThey straighten up. The girl in the middle, dark hair and dark skin and dark, glistening eyes, wearing a bright orange sweater, announces, \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth.\u201d\n\u2028\u201cTray,\u201d volunteers the boy whose pillows reeks of vodka, cheeks still flushed, hair cropped short.\nThe girl with the fringe and a Batman shirt fiddles with her hands, nervous under May\u2019s assessing stare. \u201cElizabeth the second,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone calls me Liz, though. So Elizabeth and I aren\u2019t mixed up.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this is your\u2026 dorm room?\u201d May guesses.\n\u201cMine and Shaun\u2019s,\u201d Tray says. \u201cOur redheaded friend. He and Mick have gone out. The, er. The construction worker who saved up? Um. I hope you don\u2019t mind waking up here. It was too dangerous outside.\u201d\n\u201cEvery criminal in the city is after you,\u201d Liz says, apologetic. \u201cBecause of\u2014of Peter.\u201d She says Peter\u2019s name as though she doesn\u2019t have a right to it, the word sitting awkwardly in her mouth.\nMay swallows. There\u2019s too much saliva in her mouth. Behind her eyes sit images of Peter in binds, dripping red from his puffy mouth and an open gash in his temple. Peter, baring his teeth. Peter, being beaten. Peter with crackling words and wet cheeks and heaving, spluttering breaths.\n\u201cMrs. Parker?\u201d Elizabeth says, careful.\nMay presses her shaking fingers to her forehead. Dried blood flakes under her touch.\n\u201cAre you\u2026 alright?\u201d Tray asks. His eyes are brown. There are faint, barely visible freckles on his cheeks. The three of them are so, so young, probably freshmens at university, tiptoeing into adulthood. It hurts to look at them. They look like Peter, her baby. Peter, who\u2019s bleeding far, far worse than her. Peter, who might be dead.\nMay lunges for the trashcan, hunches over it on her knees, and vomits over junk food packets and empty cans of beer.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d May promises. Liz\u2019s smart phone is bulky, the cover bedazzled in shimmering silvers and bedded pinks and looping, patterned hearts. May presses the borrowed phone closer to her cheek; the cold of it is comforting on her flushed face.\n\u201cBut are you somewhere safe?\u201d Marie demands on the other end of the call.\n\u201cYes. Stop worrying about me, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole city is after you, May! Your home is on the news; mobs of people are outside of it. I have a right to be worried.\u201d\n\n\u201cMobs?\u201d May repeats, hoarse.\n\u201cCriminals,\u201d Marie says.\n\u201cNot just!\u201d Kayleen protests. The younger of May\u2019s colleagues sounds distant. She\u2019s probably leant over Marie\u2019s shoulder, crowding into the older woman\u2019s space and butting in on the conversation. The blonde has never really understand the concept of personal space. \u201cThere are reporters, and your neighbours, and all these people who\u2019ve come to help. They\u2019re setting up a protective barricade around your house.\u201d\nMay stares at her white tennis shoes. The laces are fraying. She can\u2019t afford new ones. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nMarie huffs out a breath. \u201cAfter the news broke, crowds of people rushed to your address to make sure no one hurt you, sure, but so did lots of criminals.\u201d\n\u201cYou two are at risk as well,\u201d May says. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re both safe. Somewhere they can\u2019t find you.\u201d\n\u201cWe headed to a public library after we got separated from you,\u201d Marie reassures. \u201cIt\u2019s discreet here. No one will know we work with you. What about those students? And that nice construction worker? Are they alright?\u201d\n\u201cOh, they\u2019re fine. I\u2019m with some of them right now.\u201d May casts amused glances at the trio of students, pretending to water the tiny plant on the windowsill and peek out of the curtains, as though they weren\u2019t visibly eavesdropping on her conversation. They guilty look away. Tray shuffles and almost drops his tin watering can. \u201cThe construction worker\u2014Mick, I\u2019m told\u2014was the one that carried me here after I passed out\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPassed out?!\u201d Marie hisses. Kayleen whines, worried and mournful.\n\u201cA minor concussion, girls. Parkers are made of strong stuff. It\u2019s nothing compared to what Peter is\u2014\u201d May quiets herself with a wet cough. \u201cAnyway. Mick has escorted Shaun, that nice redheaded boy who helped me in the cafe, to go get us pizza. Mick has a family to get back to, but here he is, looking after silly old me.\u201d\nMarie hums. \u201cThe city really is scrambling to find you.\u201d\n\u201cMick wouldn\u2019t hurt me, Marie. He seems like a good man.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s not what I mean, May. Kayleen was right. People are flocking to your locations to help. Not just criminals, but good people, too. Your boy really is something.\u201d\n\nHe is, May thinks. God, Peter really is.\nShe rubs at her wet nose. Bile sits at the back of her throat, threatening to rise back up every time she thinks about her nephew and his open, bloodied face. It helps to think about the people around her. Her fellow waitress, anxious and worried on the phone. Shaun and Mick, sent off to get lunch and to scout the dorms. The trio of students, Elizabeth and Tray and Liz, peeking at May with shy, wobbly expressions.\n\u201cStay safe,\u201d May begs.\n\u201cWe will,\u201d Marie says. \u201cYou look after yourself, May. Keep yourself out of harms way. For Peter. He\u2019s going to need you when he comes back.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re technically not supposed to keep pets,\u201d Liz explains. Her socked feet are curled underneath her, cheek resting on her knees. \u201cWhenever someone comes and checks the dorms, we just hide him.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s cute,\u201d May says.\n\u201cNot many people think that.\u201d On the cramped desk sits an empty fish tank, piled with dried grass and sand. Atop a fake log, a tarantula is sprawled. It blinks its many eyes at May\u2019s blotchy face.\n\u201cMost people scream when they see him,\u201d Elizabeth agrees. \u201cTray hates him. He almost cried when he realised Shaun owned a pet spider.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve grown to like him,\u201d Tray defends. The two girls snicker into their hands at his indignation. \u201cThe little guy is endearing.\u201d\n\u201cSpiders don\u2019t bother me. Peter used to be terrified of them when he was really little, but we bought him all of these textbooks about different arachnids, and took him to the zoo to see how harmless they were up close, and told him stories about them.\u201d May smiles, unsteady and small. It\u2019s a good memory, but it hurts, now. It feels like there\u2019s an open wound in her chest, right where her heart is, struggling against her ribs. \u201cHe. He ended up loving them. Collected them in jars and ice cream containers and kept them tucked up in his room.\u201d\n\u201cHis name is Man-Spider,\u201d Liz says. \u201cWe thought it was clever\u2026\u201d\nShe fiddles with her bangs, not meeting May\u2019s eyes. She looks like she wants, desperately, to take the words back. These children, all so shy around her.\nMay puts a gentle hand on Liz\u2019s knee. \u201cI think it\u2019s clever, too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Knuckles rap on\u00a0the door. Everyone in the dorm jumps.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just us! And a bunch of ravenous vultures.\u201d The knock comes again. \u201cLet us in, guys.\u201d\nElizabeth unlocks the door, and Mick and Shaun tumble in, pizza boxes stacked in hand. They all inhale at the smell of sausage and tomato sauce. It\u2019s cloying, filling the room. May\u2019s stomach rolls.\nTray grabs a stick of garlic bread and thrusts it in the air. \u201cThey return! Victorious!\u201d\n\u201cTray, help us with these before we drop them,\u201d Shaun says. The redheaded\u2019s coifed hair has turned messy, windswept. He smiles, genuine and toothy, at May.\nHeads peek around the corner of the dorm\u2019s doorway. A dozen big eyes peer at May.\n\u201cHello,\u201d May says, a touch awkward. \u201cHungry?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough to share,\u201d Shaun says.\n\u201cShaun,\u201d May admonishes. Shaun does red under her disapproval.\nElizabeth glares at the young students crowding the doorway. They skitter under the heat of her eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re not here for pizza, Mrs. Parker,\u201d Elizabeth says. \u201cThey\u2019re here to see Spider-Man\u2019s family. Go on, shoo!\u201d She waves her hands at them and the crowd disperses, grumbling and complaining but shuffling away.\nMick shuts the door firmly. It locks with a click. \u201cThey really are vultures,\u201d Mick grumbles. His shoulders are broad, his high-vis shirt still dusty from a day\u2019s work. He dwarves the cramped dorm room with his presence. May finds reassurance from him none-the-less; it\u2019s nice to have another adult around, surrounded by four students barely out of their teens.\n\u201cThank you for getting lunch,\u201d May says. \u201cAnd for carrying me here after I passed out.\u201d\nMick shrugs, uncomfortable. The four teenagers arrange themselves in a semicircle, the pizza boxes open in the middle. His long body folds down, cross-legged, next to Tray. The student is almost half the man\u2019s size.\nMick accepts a slice of pepperoni pizza with a nod. May takes one from Shaun with a nod of thanks, but doesn\u2019t eat. She nibbles at the loose, greasy cheese, her stomach a ball of twisting, anxious knots.\n\u201cHe saved my daughter,\u201d Mick blurts. All eyes dart to him. Mick picks at the burnt crust of his pizza slice, and continues, \u201cA few months ago, I took my son and baby girl to the park to have lunch. My son tripped and started bawling, so I put her down for a second, just long enough to go and grab my son. Then this concrete truck comes tearing around the corner, out of control\u2026\u201d\nLiz\u2019s hands are clasped to her mouth. Shaun\u2019s eyes are wide. May reaches out and puts a small hand on Mick\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cI was too far away to grab her. She was sitting on the grass, playing with a ball, and this truck went off the road. It headed right for her.\u201d Mick takes a deep, steadying breath. Lets it out. \u201cAnd then, out of nowhere, Spider-Man drops in front of it, and catches it. He put his body in front of the truck that was going to kill my baby girl and caught it with his whole body. He could\u2019ve died, but he still did it.\u201d\n\u201cIs your daughter okay?\u201d Tray asks, quietly. Mick nods at his work boots.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be here, Mick.\u201d May\u2019s hand travels down the bumpy line of his sleeve, until she\u2019s cradling one broad hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe my family a debt. That\u2019s not what Peter is about. He helps because he can, not because he wants anything from people.\u201d\nMick shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t care. He saved my family. It\u2019s my turn to help save his.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen the pizza boxes are empty and the garlic bread demolished, shouts echo up from the street. Elizabeth rushes to the window, prying the curtains apart. She swears, violently, before whirling on the dorm\u2019s occupants.\n\u201cWho blabbed?\u201d Elizabeth demands. Everyone stares up at her. \u201cCome on. Fuss up. Who blabbed?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone said anything\u2014\u201d Liz says.\n\u201cOh, yeah? Then how come there are a group of pissed off guys\u00a0outside?!\u201d\n\u201cTime to go!\u201d Shaun yelps.\nThey rush for the door. Mick leads her. Tray rushes behind her. \u201cTime to go,\u201d he agrees.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe should\u2019ve known,\u201d Mick grumbles, words jumping with each panted breath. \u201cAll those students who crowded your dorm and saw May? Goddamnn social media. Goddamn young people.\u201d\nElizabeth shoots him a scathing look. \u201cThat kind of generalisation is toxic and gross. Older people are just as bad\u2014\u201d\n\u201cArgue later,\u201d Tray wheezes. His face is sweaty. He\u2019s panting with every step. \u201cRun now!\u201d\nThe thugs chasing them are fast. Too fast for May and her band of out-of-shape students who subside mostly on ramen and cheap alcohol. Liz is lagging, sweaty bangs plastered to her face.\nLiz trips and goes down in a flail of limbs, yelping. May immediately swoops down to help her.\n\u201cNo\u2014\u201d Mick tries, but it\u2019s too late; a muscle-bound man with a pale bald spot grabs her around the forearm, dragging her away from Liz.\nHe breaths heavily down her neck. His sausage-like fingers are a vice, leaving bruises. His fist rises. May\u2019s eyes squeeze shut in preparation, waiting for the pain, for his meaty fist to drive home.\nMick drives himself between May and the criminal, a wedge, a wall, and punches him full in the mouth. The criminal drops like a stone.\n\u201cMrs. Parker\u2014go!\u201d Mick shouts. Shaun and Elizabeth plant themselves between May and the inbound criminals, faces pulled into masks of determination. \u201cGO!\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d May says, but Liz and Tray are there, tugging her away. She distantly hears sirens. She prays they make it in time.\nLiz leads their precession. Her jeans are ripped and bloodied at the knees. Tray holds onto May\u2019s hand and together they run, the shouting threats and promises of violence echoing down the street. People stare as they race past.\nThe air crackles. Electro rises in the sky. May has only ever seen him on TV. Looking at him up close is like glimpsing the sun, too bright to look directly at, leaving black dots dancing along her vision.\n\u201cShit,\u201d Liz says. Tray gulps, shrinking into his hoodie like a turtle sinking into his shell.\n\u201cMay Parker. I saw your nephew on the news earlier,\u201d Electro says. A smile flicks along his face. It\u2019s difficult to make out around the squirming veins of energy that engulfs his features. \u201cI hope he dies slow.\u201d\nThe sound May makes in the back of her throat is inhuman.\nElectro reaches out a hand like he\u2019s going to help her up. Electricity crackles. Glows. The villain\u2019s smile widens. May wonders how Peter can do this every night, can face people like this, who have power and death racing through their blood, who smile with their teeth, like they want to eat her whole.\nA man in a rumpled business shirt stands at the opening of a subway station. He\u2019s braced at the top of the slopping stairs, waving his hands frantically in the air, and calling, \u201cMrs. Parker! Mrs Parker! This way!\u201d\nElectro fires a burst of blue lightning. Liz pushes May and Tray toward the subway station, but falls, skittering on the ground.\n\u201cLiz!\u201d May says. She tries to help her once again, but Tray pulls her bodily toward the subway station.\nTray pulls them to the businessman as she watches Liz tear off in the opposite direction, ducking into the safety of a long alleyway. Only then does May go loose and compliant, letting the businessman usher them down the steps, out of the sunlight and into the crammed space of a subway station.\nNormally, you have to fight to board a train at this hour. Normally, you have to fight not to be pushed over by the masses trying to cram onto the train.\nBut today\u2014in this artificially lit station full of busy people, the crowded train waiting with open doors\u2014that doesn\u2019t happen. Today, this stranger in his wrinkled suit and his sweat damp hair, cups his hands to his mouth, and yells across the sea of people, \u201cWe\u2019ve got May Parker here!\u201d\nThe noise dims. Heads turn. And then, like the great parting of the sea, people step back. May sees a teenage girl grab onto her friends and tug them back; she sees a tall, towering man in a High-Vis polo shirt and dusty boots step back, quieted by her presence; she sees aching, tired people who have been worked all day, who are desperate to get home, give up their place on their train. For her.\nMay Parker has lived in New York City most of her life. She has never witnessed something quite like this. Not up close. Not like this.\nThere\u2019s a lump in her throat. Tray grabs her wrist, drags her into the train, and she chokes on hot tears. She receives half a dozen nods; quiet motions of acknowledgement. She tries to return the stares of so many people, and flounders around the wetness in her throat, prickling in her eyes, and lets a teenage boy pull her into the safety of a waiting train.\nElectro lurks outside the street. He might hunt down Liz. He might hunt down this crowd full of people. But she knows Electro and all the criminals in this giant city would kill her if she stayed.\nThey board the train, and a young woman gives up her seat. May takes in the stranger\u2019s kind smile, her Avengers t-shirt, and muffles a sob into her palm.\nTray flutters above her. \u201cMrs. Parker, are you\u2014are you okay?!\u201d\n\u201cI keep crying today,\u201d she scolds herself. She wipes at her eyes and tries to steady her jittery breathing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t seem to stop. And I keep making trouble for people.\u201d\nThe elderly woman in the seat opposite May has soft eyes and a calm voice. She leans in, elbows on her knees, and tells May, \u201cI think that\u2019s understandable.\u201d\nTray nods his agreement. The people standing around the train carriage all pretend not to stare openly, but their gaze keep trailing to her. The people either side of her are biting at their lips.\nMay swallows. She asks the opposite woman, \u201cIs it\u2026 is my face everywhere, now?\u201d\nMay expects an apologetic grimace. She doesn\u2019t expect an earnest nod. \u201cEveryone wants to know if you\u2019re safe, Mrs. Parker.\u201d\n\u201cAnd\u2026 and Peter\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re searching,\u201d promises the man on May\u2019s left. His earphones have been pulled out, dangling around the collar of his plaid shirt. He, too, looks earnest. \u201cThe Avengers have gotten involved.\u201d\nA man hanging onto the hand rail nods. \u201cThe Fantastic Four, too. Johnny Storm was\u2014was pretty upset, I heard. Kid looked like he was going to cry when I saw him on the news.\u201d\n\u201cJohnny,\u201d May murmurs. \u201cHe and Peter are very close.\u201d The tears are back. She can feel them prick at her eyes, press wetly at the back of her throat, and stick in her lashes. \u201cTogether, they\u2019re a couple of troublemakers. A force to be reckoned with.\u201d\nA hand rubs at her back. May doesn\u2019t know who it is, but it\u2019s warm, and soft, and there. It reminds her of Kayleen and her small, soft hands and murmured words; it reminds her of Marie and her firm affection; it reminds her of Mick, hand guiding and strong, volunteering to guard her.\n\u201cWhat is he like?\u201d Tray asks quietly. His words are heard throughout the quiet carriage.\nMay closes her eyes. She focusses on the rattle of train tracks, and the swaying of carriage cars, and her own breathing, congested with bottled tears. She takes in a long breath. Lets it out. Slowly, she starts, \u201cHe\u2019s sixteen. He likes science. He\u2019s the bravest person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\nThe train hurtles through the city. The train carriage is full, crowded with over a dozen people, but nobody speaks over her. These are strangers pressed around her. Strangers, who give her time to breath around her tears and listen, attentive, patient, as she tells them about her nephew and how amazing he is. It\u2019s a stranger that hands her a fresh tissue from their purse. It\u2019s strangers that have been saving May all day.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d May says. The seat next to her has opened up, and Tray has already taken it. Their arms press together. The train has passed through several stations. People have gotten off, gotten on. Most stay. Some miss their stations, just for this, for her words, for the addictive, unitive atmosphere blanketing the carriage. \u201cEveryone\u2019s being so nice to me. Everyone\u2019s tripping over themselves for me. I would\u2019ve thought everyone would\u2019ve acted the opposite if Peter\u2019s identity got out.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Spider-Man.\u201d A teenager by the window, still in his school uniform, bag slung over his shoulders, shrugs as though it\u2019s obvious. It\u2019s not. Not to May. \u201cHe\u2019s as much a part of New York as Central Park, or greasy pizza, or bad traffic.\u201d\nThe elderly woman who sits across from May, who\u2019s sat there since May first boarded, who looks at her with those gentle, understanding eyes, says, \u201cHe\u2019s looked after this city. It\u2019s high time this city\u2019s looked after him and his family.\u201d\nAgreement ripples through the carriage. The bearded man to May\u2019s left says, \u201cAmen to that.\u201d\nTray wets his lips. \u201cI know a lot of people who want to\u2014to give back, y\u2019know? There\u2019s only so many posters we can make, or supportive shirts we can buy, or dumb pet spiders we can name after heroes. We finally get a chance to actually help. And you can bet we\u2019re going to take that chance. If we can help, you can bet we\u2019re going to.\u201d\n\u201cYou sound like him,\u201d May chokes out. \u201cYou all sound like Peter.\u201d\nThe train shudders to a stop at another station. A group of laughing teenagers board, shoving past adults, taking up too much space. Their eyes trace the tense lines of the crowd, follow them to May, and fall into hushed, embarrassed silence. They shrink into themselves, tempered.\nTray sways with the train. He\u2019s already rung his friends; Mick and Shaun and Elizabeth made it out. The police arrived before things got too bloody. Together, they met back up with Liz, and took an injured Mick to a hospital. A broken arm, a bruised face, but otherwise fine. Annoyed he couldn\u2019t help more. (When this is all over, May is going to have to visit them all. She\u2019ll have to bake them something special. Brownies. A cake. A whole truckload of cookies, maybe.)\nMarie and Kayleen are safe, too. They\u2019re all safe. Electro is hissing ineffectual sparks in the sky, burning himself out, too wound up with impatience.\n\u201cThey found him!\u201d A man leaps to his feet. He holds his phone up, scans the crowd, and declares again, \u201cThey found Spider-Man!\u201d\nA cheer sweeps the carriage\u2014an elated shout of noise. Hands raise, people bump together. The teenagers by the doors bloom into noise, stomping their feet and hollering, clutching at one another. Tray shrieks into his hands. The woman across from May presses her hands together and says a quiet, thankful prayer.\nMay Parker, tired, aching, burnt out like a candle drowning in its own melted wax, digs her fingers into her eyes and sobs.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey leave the train with cheers and waves goodbye. Tray stays with her, even though dusk is beginning to settle on the city, smearing the skies with dark oranges, streetlights blinking to life. He\u2019s tired from running all day, but still, Tray stays.\nThey climb into the back of a cab. The driver takes one look at May, at her red cheeks, and says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about paying. It\u2019s on the house.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d May tries.\n\u201cI have money!\u201d Tray begins. \u201cSome. I have some money.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s on me,\u201d says the cabbie, firmly. \u201cWherever you need to go, I\u2019ll take you.\u201d\n\u201cAvengers Tower,\u201d May gives in. \u201cPlease hurry.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA crowd has formed at the base of Avengers Tower. It happens regularly, May knows. In the aftermath of fights, or injuries, or scandals, people congregate around the Tower, only to be moved along sooner or later by security. She\u2019s seen the crushing throngs of people\u2014journalists, but mostly enthused, supportive fans\u2014on the news, but she\u2019s never fully understood it. The Avengers never come down to meet them. They have flying teammates, a flying jet; superheroes don\u2019t need to use mundane things like front doors. But still, the masses still come.\nTray leads May into the crowd. This time, there\u2019s no businessman to shout her arrival over the packs of people, but still, they part. May holds her head high, fists clenched tight, and like the red sea, like shifting, tectonic plates, the crowd parts for May Parker.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTony Stark is shorter in person. Steve Rogers is taller. They both look grim when she meets them, faces schooled, hands clasped behind their backs.\n\u201cMrs. Parker,\u201d Captain America begins, stepping forward. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d May says. Tray is freaking out behind her, gone rubbery in the presence of the two Avengers. May doesn\u2019t notice.\nSteve clears his throat. \u201cM\u2019am\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy son, Captain,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to see my son.\u201d\nThey lead her to him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis face is swollen and purpled. May can see bruises in the shape of a fist around his long, pale throat. Someone has wiped the blood and tears from his face, bandaged the deep gash along his cheek and temple, and bundled him up beneath white medical sheets and a cosy afghan.\nHer baby. Peter. He blinks puffy, red rimmed eyes at her.\nMay slides into the seat by his bedside. She leans forward, takes her nephew\u2019s hand, and presses a wet kiss to his bloodied knuckles.\nPeter raises his free hand to her cheek. His touch is shaky, reverent, wiping at her tears. \u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m okay, sweetheart,\u201d she says, retrieving his hand and hiding it with the other, cuddled beneath her laced fingers. She\u2019s gentle with him. She\u2019s careful not to jostle his IV or the raw wounds. \u201cYou made sure I was okay.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the reason you were in trouble in the first place,\u201d Peter argues.\n\u201cNone of that, Peter,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re a hero, Peter. A brilliant one.\u201d\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let myself get caught\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDid you want them to catch you? Did you ask them to?\u201d He shakes his head, no. His face is so wrecked. He\u2019s in so much pain. It hurts to look at him. \u201cThen you\u2019re not to blame. Peter\u2026 you made sure I was okay, even when they tied you up and hurt you.\u201d\nHe wets his cracked lips. \u201cWhat do you mean\u2026.?\u201d\n\u201cThe city, sweetheart. New York. You told them to protect me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd they did?\u201d There\u2019s awe on that ruined face. Beneath the bruises, dark like thick, smeared dirt; beneath the tired, mournful tilt to his lips, there\u2019s awe and the dim, crackling light of hope.\n\u201cThey did,\u201d May promises. \u201cDozens and dozens of people, Peter. The girls I work with. A man whose daughter you saved. A handful of students that remind me of you; one of them, Tray, is outside. You have to met him. He\u2019s a big fan.\u201d Slowly, gently, May cradles Peter\u2019s sore face in her hands. Her gaze is steady. \u201cThis city saved me, Peter. This city made sure I was okay. Because of you.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s crying. May\u2019s eyes are wet. She\u2019s been crying all day, ever since she first saw the bleary, tortured face of her nephew flare over the TV. This time, May isn\u2019t ashamed of her tears.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Peter says it into her hands. He says it to the air. He says it to the window stretching over one wall, where the cityscape of New York twinkles, gleaming with thousands of blinking lights, like stars, like people waving back. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d\n\u00a0"
