    "text": "\u201cYou had to put it next to the literature, didn\u2019t you.\u201d Aziraphale frowns at the impossibly slick sliver of plasma screen sitting neatly in the bookcase across from them.\nCrowley leans back into the obliging leather of the sofa, dragging the cork free from the Cune Rioja Imperial Gran Reserva 2004. Spanish wasn\u2019t normally a first choice, but they\u2019d had a case of these beauties stashed in one of the bookshop\u2019s broom closets and it was finally aged in. They might even manage to draw the rest of the supply out through the next decade of its peak if they exercised uncommon self-restraint. That was one of the pluses to the sky still being in one piece: plenty of decades to waste, and it seemed that the boredom of humans would continue to produce wonders through all of them. Sushi had been a revelation, but the 21st century appeared determined to beat out any other when it came to culinary invention, liquid Nitrogen for one thing, and somehow tapas became more fascinating each month, but tonight they\u2019d settled for what was quickly becoming a Tuesday regular. The place five doors down from the bookshop did a lamb flatbread with just enough zing in the sauce they\u2019d been incapable of resisting.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Crowley says, eyeing the TV, \u201cI should have had one a quarter of a century ago. And I know judgement is rather hard habit to break, but you might as well give it a try. Remember the hell the King James was supposed to unleash?\u201d\n\u201cAllow me to make some distinction between the Word of God and 'WestEnders'.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s EastEnders you complete relic,\u201d Crowley can\u2019t help grinning. \u201cThe alliteration wasn\u2019t a bit of a tip off?\u201d\nAziraphale ignores him in a way that\u2019s getting unsettlingly easy for him, heading for the flatbread instead.\nCrowley\u2019s left the windows of the flat just open enough that a breeze could push into the room, full of the smell of the city and the decaying crisp that always comes along with autumn. He\u2019s always like autumn. There is a tension to it he can\u2019t seem to avoid feeling in the air, something about the lines blurring and harvest moons and other nonsense he really should know better than to let into his system. But fall was nice all on its own wasn\u2019t it? Cool, fresh, everything settling into itself for the long sleep.\nAlthough tonight isn\u2019t exactly following the trend. It was one of those pernicious early autumn nights that summer reached out to desperately, getting its fingers around it just enough to make the evening a balmy reminder of just what you\u2019d be missing soon enough.\nHe\u2019s succumbed to it easily enough, wearing his thinner grey wool slacks and a white linen shirt, the sleeves rolled up with just enough artlessness to be fashionable. He\u2019s even cuffed his pants a fold or two, bare feet comfortable on the smooth wood floor under him.\nAziraphale seems as always to be impervious to all seasons and any sense of fashion. Annoying, how his disregard and frumpy jumpers were actually becoming rather trendy these days. This one wasn\u2019t actually all the horrible, a sort of lighter oatmeal woolen blend, perhaps a bit too matching with the khakis he\u2019s wearing. He\u2019s left his sneakers by the door, socked toes tapping idly on the floor.\n\u201cHow\u2019s the Rioja?\u201d He asks as Crowley takes a slow sip.\n\u201cMmm,\u201d he hums back, letting the wine linger on his tongue. \u201cChewy. With just a shadow of tobacco.\u201d\n\u201cLovely,\u201d Aziraphale sighs, filling up his own glass.\nCrowley snaps once, flicking the telly into life.\n\u201cOh dear, must we?\u201d Aziraphale groans.\n\u201cWe already did your thing,\u201d Crowley insists.\n\u201cYou liked that as much as I did,\u201d he says. \u201cThose Tibetan musical scores were treasures.\u201d\nThey really had been, all flowing shapes and easing lines. He\u2019s always thought western languages truly missed the boat on creating new form out of script by always favoring order above artistry. But he wasn\u2019t giving the angel the higher ground that easily. \u201cYou always overestimate my enjoyment of mildew.\u201d\n\u201cSmelled it through the plexiglass could you?\u201d Aziraphale teases.\nCrowley rolls his eyes, taking another sip to avoid smiling. \u201cFair\u2019s fair.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d he concedes, \u201cbut no \u2018reality\u2019 please.\u201d\n\u201cNot a problem. Here,\u201d Crowley tosses the remote into his lap, \u201cI\u2019ll even let you drive.\u201d\nAziraphale frowns down at the small slim thing, wrapping his fingers around it gingerly. \u201cSo I what, change the channels?\u201d He pushes his glasses a little higher up his nose.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bit archaic by now, it\u2019s a more on-demand system that\u2019s vogue. Netflix, Hulu; it\u2019s all select and watch.\u201d\n\u201cStill \u2018TV\u2019?\u201d Aziraphale asks, pronouncing the letters like something in novel language.\n\u201cApple TV, actually,\u201d Crowley corrects.\nAziraphale huffs. \u201cBit too much salt in the wound there don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u201cPlease, I wish I was that clever. But I suppose you never know, whole new world, whole new bite.\u201d\nAziraphale\u2019s fiddling with the buttons, navigating around the menus, looking at the screen with a face that\u2019s likely fairly close to the one Crowley gets staring into those tomes of his.\n\u201cOffer any guidance?\u201d He asks.\nCrowley gets his own slice of flatbread, careful to get a napkin between his hand and the slight shine of grease. \u201cNetflix.\u201d\n\u201cThe abuse these people put language to,\u201d Aziraphale chides.\n\u201cThey do tend to get bored with established systems.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t hog it,\u201d Aziraphale says, knocking his glass against the wine bottle in Crowley\u2019s hands, eyes still on the television.\nCrowley fills it again. \u201cRelax. There\u2019s six bottles in the kitchen.\u201d\nAziraphale\u2019s flicking helplessly down the listings, small commercially-pleasing \u201cclicks\u201d sounding from the television. His hair\u2019s getting in his eyes just a tad but he pushes it back easily enough. He\u2019s been letting it get a little longer lately, and it obnoxiously fell just right every time. Angelic hair, it always seemed to manage itself beautiful, one of those lingering traits from upstairs that really paid off.\nCrowley sighs, finally taking pity. \u201cHow about just a film? What are you up for?\u201d\n\u201cSomething pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cRomance?\u201d He suggests.\n\u201c\u2018It Happened One Night\u2019?\u201d Aziraphale suggests instantly.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen it.\u201d\n\u201cOnly a few times.\u201d\n\u201cTwo-hundred and eighty three.\u201d\nAziraphale smiles over his glasses. \u201cBut we love it.\u201d\nCrowley couldn\u2019t deny it, but he\u2019d started this, he might as well do his best to drag him out of permanent residence in 1953, even if he couldn\u2019t quite reach the new millennium yet.\n\u201cWhat about this one?\u201d Aziraphale asked. He\u2019s actually managed to get the selector where he wants it. \u201c\u2018The English Patient\u2019, sounds interesting, looks promising.\u201d\n\u201cNo, thank you. Looks like war,\u201d Crowley says. \u201cAnd of the impossibly more useless variety. What about the one next to it?\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Shakespeare in Love\u2019?\u201d Aziraphale lets the selector slide over. \u201cYou think?\u201d\n\u201cSounds alright, doesn\u2019t it? And it\u2019s 98\u2019 so you needed fear slipping too far into the future. Or rather the present.\u201d\nAziraphale sighs in his general direction but pushes play all the same.\nAs it turns out it is alright, albeit a little historically distracting. The costumes are excellent, and the cinematography admirable, with just the right amount of comedy and a salting of despair- very much in the same vein as the works that inspired it. There\u2019s a comfort to it as well, and an excitement that let\u2019s the pace carry on well and even.\n\u201cInteresting take isn\u2019t it?\u201d Aziraphale says, leaning a little deeper into the sofa.\nThey\u2019ve managed to vanquish about half of the flatbread and the second bottle of wine is sitting empty next to its remains. Crowley\u2019s feet are tucked up under him now, as he leans heavy on his hand, propped up with an elbow on the armrest.\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d he concedes. \u201cOf course Tybalt and Benvolio don\u2019t seem to be quite as distracted groping each other in the wings as I remember during the original.\u201d\n\u201cThey were all groping each other in the wings,\u201d Aziraphale notes.\n\u201cEspecially him,\u201d Crowley gestures at the goateed man with significantly prettier eyes than the playwright he\u2019s portraying. \u201cWhat was it he used to say?\u201d\n\u201cIncreased the tension of the performance,\u201d Aziraphale remembers instantly.\nCrowley smiles into the last of his wine. \u201cWhat a tosser.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t loose that though did they?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cAll that,\u201d the angel waves at the screen with a fair amount of tipsy disorientation. \u201cThe \u2018tension\u2019, the passion, romance, what have you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I suppose not,\u201d Crowley groans managing to get to his feet, and head (head, certainly not stumble) toward the rest of the bottles in the kitchen. \u201cBut humans have always been quite good at all that \u2018what have you\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose you would know,\u201d Aziraphale calls back. Crowley\u2019s apartment always maintained an open floor plan, so the kitchen wasn\u2019t so much a kitchen as an especially shiny part of the general living space.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He glances back towards the TV and the couch. Aziraphale\u2019s still watching the film, one arm slung along the backrest, wine swirling idly in the glass between his fingers.\n\u201cThat whole seduction business, much more up your cup of tea.\u201d\nCrowley snorts, easily dragging the cork free of a new bottle. \u201cI don\u2019t know, seems to be quite a bit of \u2018passion\u2019 leaking down from up your way.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d Aziraphale counters. \u201cMetaphorical not tangible.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never been one for the more tangible seductions personally.\u201d Crowley murmurs, the neck of the wine bottle ringing gently as it taps the side of his glass and he starts to pour.\nThere\u2019s a rustling from the couch. \u201cWhat? Really? So you never\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? As you lot might put it, \u2018known\u2019 any individuals? No, not so much.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Aziraphale notes. \u201cI rather thought it was one of those required CV points down there.\u201d\nCrowley straightens up, at least as well as he can, rolling his glass and glancing at him over his sunglasses. Aziraphale\u2019s leaned back over the couch, eyeing him skeptically.\n\u201cWhen did we start discussing my sex life?\u201d Crowley squints.\n\u201cI suppose just now,\u201d Aziraphale answers.\n\u201cI always imagined that kind of talk would get you sort all manner of flustered.\u201d\nAziraphale smirks. \u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s much to get flustered over.\u201d\nCrowley felt an unexpected surge of defensiveness. \u201cAs if you would know.\u201d\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t and I most definitely didn\u2019t suggest I would, merely surprised you\u2019re bumbling around in the dark as well, dear boy.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d Crowley starts, brandishing his wine glass. \u201cI am not \u2018bumbling around in the dark,\u2019 I\u2019m just remaining well out of the shadowy bits.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why\u2019s that? Seems sort of interesting doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cThat is because I\u2019m far more interested in subtle and far-reaching where my work is concerned, and that,\u201d he gestures at the television where there\u2019s a decent amount of writhing taking place, \u201cis the very opposite of subtle and quite limited in its range of effect. Not to mention\u2014 hold on\u2026 What did you say?\u201d\n\u201cI said it seems interesting.\u201d Aziraphale says, turning back to the television.\nCrowley stares at the back of his head which is still vexingly perfect.\n\u201cSo you never\u2026 I mean, not even upstairs, before all of this?\u201d Crowley tries.\n\u201cLook who\u2019s \u2018flustered\u2019 now.\u201d Aziraphale sounds like he\u2019s smiling. \u201cAnd no, not so much. Always looked a little too\u2026 combustable.\u201d\nCrowley snorts agreement. It was that for sure, not to mention the fact that there was always some strange sense of vanity in it. The angels that liked to fold energy around each other always seemed like the sort who would be most comfortable slowly flexing in front of a full length mirror for the better part of the morning.\n\u201cAre you sharing that?\u201d Aziraphale asks without turning, wiggling his now empty glass in the air.\nCrowley manages to stop staring, sorting himself out enough to make a halfway dignified return to the couch. He collapses back into it, leaning over to fill both glasses again. \u201cWhere\u2019s all this sudden curiosity coming from?\u201d\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Aziraphale hums, taking a fresh sip. \u201cNot exactly sudden. Its always been rather intriguing, just not particularly motivating.\u201d\nCrowley laughs. He can\u2019t help it. And the wine is very good.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d Aziraphale asks.\n\u201cAre you joking?\u201d Crowley tilts his head to look at him over his glasses. \u201cNo, nothing at all, this is all perfectly normal. Very dull conversation really.\u201d\nAziraphale smiles back. \u201cWhat\u2019s funnier, dear boy? That I\u2019ve considered it or that you haven\u2019t?\u201d\nCrowley holds up a hand defensively. \u201cNow, now, I never said I hadn\u2019t considered it.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I see.\u201d Aziraphale says. He rolls his head to one side. \u201cAnd when was this, exactly?\u201d\nCrowley doesn\u2019t look back at him. He keeps his shrouded eyes on the television, wineglass resting against his lower lip. \u201cWell, watching the world flicker in and out of existence a few times in an afternoon, I suppose it makes you think.\u201d\nAziraphale\u2019s still watching him quietly but Crowley doesn\u2019t look back. After a moment the angel turns away with a sigh, leaning forward clumsily to pry and miraculously still steaming slice of flatbread off the tray.\n\u201cSo?\u201d He says after a moment, hanging the syllable questioningly.\nCrowley crosses one leg over another. He has a sneaking suspicion the strange feeling in his stomach might be nerves. It\u2019s an irritating novelty. \u201cSo what?\u201d\n\u201cCare to give it a try?\u201d\nCrowley snorts half his wine, and just manages not to spill any on his linen. As quickly as he can he gathers himself back up, glaring over at the angel.\nAziraphale\u2019s smiling. \u201cFlustered?\u201d\nCrowley growls. \u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u201cIs that a no?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Crowley says. A good deal too quickly. Bugger it. And lord that\u2019s not the right curse to toss about at a moment like this. \u201cIsn\u2019t this body a little too\u2026 heretical?\u201d he suggests. \u201cStrange flesh and all that?\u201d\nAziraphale takes another generous sip of wine as he shrugs. \u201cNo more biblically offensive than wearing garments made from two different threads.\u201d\n\u201cAlways thought it was obscenely picky, that one.\u201d Crowley notes. \u201cPicker than you apparently.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d Aziraphale says, and suddenly Crowley can\u2019t help but look at him. \u201cIf I\u2019m one thing, it\u2019s picky.\u201d\nCrowley tries to convince his brain to go back to functioning seamlessly. He should probably sober up about now, but the wine\u2019s a halfway decent excuse at the moment for the heavy feeling on his tongue, so he doesn\u2019t.\nPart of him wants to stand up laugh it off, brush the conversation aside and continue on as if it never happened. But another part of him, an annoying tight stomached part of him, can\u2019t seem to stop noticing how Aziraphale\u2019s glasses have slipped down in that stupid way he never seems to pay attention to, and how his jumper is pushed up his arms just high enough to see a slight play of freckles on his forearms.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Crowley says finally, leaning back into the squish of the sofa.\n\u201cYes, what, dear?\u201d Aziraphale asks.\n\u201cWe could give it a try.\u201d Crowley says, eyes fixed on the television. \u201cSometime.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Aziraphale says. \u201cRight. Sometime.\u201d He leans back to match, sipping the wine. The movie continues, somehow right back to where it was before they got distracted with this absurd conversation.\n\u201cSeems a bit of a strange thing to start,\u201d Aziraphale says finally. \u201cTricky.\u201d\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Crowley agrees.\nAziraphale frowns. \u201cWould I have be naked.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more traditional than obligatory,\u201d Crowley says, doing his best to avoid blushing like a complete idiot at that idea. \u201cAnyways, you used to wander around sans-jumpers as a general rule.\u201d\n\u201cNaked and nude are slightly different concepts,\u201d Aziraphale notes.\n\u201cShould I find you some fig-leaves?\u201d Crowley suggests.\nAziraphale glares.\nCrowley smiles back, the tightness in his stomach giving ground slightly. \u201cYou know what I think we need?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, my dear?\u201d\nCrowley empties the last of their bottle into his glass. \u201cTwo more bottles of this, and to finish watching this bloody film.\u201d\nAziraphale smiles. \u201cI think that we could manage.\u201d\nBy the end it\u2019s more like three bottles but Crowley\u2019s not exactly sure he\u2019s keeping track right. The breeze that pushes into the apartment\u2019s gotten more seasonably cool over the past few hours. Crowley blearily thinks he should probably shut the windows, but it\u2019s a hazy thought at best, and the cool actually feels fairly excellent. That and he\u2019s almost sure Aziraphale isn\u2019t cold. He\u2019s never really cold.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Aziraphale manages, watching the screen as the credits slip up a shot of the beach that\u2019s steadily easing into black. \u201cThat was rather more depressing than accepted\u2014 expected, rather.\u201d\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Crowley agrees. That heavy tongue thing has gotten worse. He\u2019s almost positive if he opens his mouth to say anything he won\u2019t be able to get halfway through a sentence without pulling his \u201cs\u201d\u2019s into an absurd length.\n\u201cDidn\u2019 think would go qu- quite so\u2026 Really was depressing.\u201d Aziraphale frowns.\nCrowley makes another noise. He hopes it sounds comforting. He\u2019s almost completely collapsed on his side of the sofa by now, feet pulled up for warmth initially, but they escaped from under his legs around the third bottle of wine, and now his toes are close enough to Aziraphale\u2019s khaki covered leg that he\u2019d just have to stretch them out a bit to dive them under the fold of cloth and feel the warmth he knew was waiting there. And lord he must be drunk, because he\u2019s suddenly wondering if Aziraphale\u2019s ticklish.\nHe\u2019s tempted to ask him but the angel suddenly stands up, wobbles, and manages to grab the empty wine bottles, heading for the kitchen. Crowley frowns at the now empty couch cushions.\nOff in the kitchen he hears the wine bottles make their way clumsily into the sink. With a groan he lets his head fall back on the arm of the sofa before summoning the necessary courage to stand. He makes it about three feet before falling against the back of the sofa for a moment of support.\nAziraphale\u2019s moving past him again, gathering up the flatbread remains. \u201cDid you like it?\u201d\nCrowley focuses. \u201cPardon?\u201d\nAziraphale\u2019s already on his way back towards the kitchen and Crowley follows him thoughtlessly. \u201cThe movie- film. Like it?\u201d He asks again.\n\u201cMm,\u201d Crowley hums, leaning heavily on the cool steel of the countertop. \u201cWas alright. Niccce. Sssad. \u2019S too bad. Bloody America.\u201d\nAziraphale isn\u2019t looking at him. He\u2019s apparently too busy fiddling with the plates, making sure they get into the sink, which is absurd because Crowley certainly isn\u2019t going to wash them. Strange sometimes, the human lines that get blurred in these funny lives of theirs.\n\u201cLook, before, that was a rather ridiculous, thing to say. Foolish, really,\u201d Aziraphale says to the sink. \u201cYou know the\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFluster?\u201d Crowley tries helpfully.\nAziraphale sighs at the plates. \u201cIt\u2019s not that, well, I wouldn\u2019t want you to ass -assum - think\u2026\u201d\nCrowley frowns. His sunglasses are suddenly far too heavy and can\u2019t seem to stay even, so he slides them off, pushing them down the steel countertop as far as he can reach.\n\u201cI su-suppose,\u201d Aziraphale continues, \u201cI didn\u2019 mean to push at you or\u2014\u201c he turns around.\nCrowley blinks at him, head heavy where he\u2019s got it propped up on his hand.\nAziraphale\u2019s mouth is open but apparently it isn\u2019t working properly either. He shuts it. Then opens it again. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just\u2026\u201d\nCrowley reaches out suddenly, and with coordination that surprises even him, he takes Aziraphale\u2019s glasses off his nose.\nAziraphale stares.\nCrowley twists the glasses in his fingers and then with a small frown turns them around and pushes them onto his own face. A strand of dark hair falls in front of his eyes and he blows it out of the way.\nHe looks back up at Aziraphale, blinking through the unfamiliar lenses.\u201cHow\u2019s it look?\u201d\nAziraphale kisses him.\nCrowley just manages to let out a short surprised noise and not fall backwards. It\u2019s a rather awkward arrangement, what with Aziraphale leaning half his body over the counter in order to get a hand under Crowley\u2019s chin and tilt it up to meet him. The glasses somehow stay where he\u2019d put them but Crowley doesn\u2019t notice. His eyes have fluttered shut.\nThey stay like that for a moment and then, all at once, Aziraphale lets him go, falling back to his side of the counter. Crowley stares dumbly at the now empty space in front of his face, lips still pushed slightly forward.\nAziraphale straightens again, cheeks far more pink than anyone\u2019s cheeks have any right to be.\nHe clears his throat once. \u201cOops.\u201d\nCrowley looks at him.\nFor someone as drunk as he is, it\u2019s a bit too easily to climb onto the counter and a hand around his collar. Or maybe he\u2019s just sobered up to make sure he manages it alright.\nHis knees are bony and a bit painful even through his slacks on the steel of the counter, but it just takes half a second to get there, and then they\u2019re kissing again.\nHe feels Aziraphale huff against him, half surprise and half something else that has Crowley\u2019s stomach doing things he\u2019s not entirely familiar with. Aziraphale\u2019s hands go up in surprise at first, but Crowley thoughtlessly slips his lips open and suddenly fingers are weaving into his hair, firm and demanding. He kisses him, exactly the way he wants to, exactly the way he\u2019s starting to realize he\u2019s always rather wanted to.\nThe glasses crush uncomfortably between them as Crowley tilts his head for a better angle and he\u2019s really going to have to get properly situated. He pulls back for a moment, sliding his knees forward so he\u2019s sitting on the edge of the counter instead on kneeling on it. Aziraphale waits, breath shorter and closer than he\u2019s heard it before. Crowley resists looking at him, reaching up between them and pulling the glasses off.\nAziraphale lets out a frustrated sound and then a hand is sliding up his cheek, around the back of his neck and pulling him back again. Crowley gasps into the kiss. It\u2019s harder than he was expecting, and this time the angel\u2019s the one to let his lips slip apart, dragging an unexpected tongue across Crowley\u2019s lower lip, and oh-\nCrowley surges, instantly dropping his jaw and letting him all the way in. Aziraphale makes a sound, something deep that hums against his chest and Crowley\u2019s hands are moving without permission, sliding up either side of the angel\u2019s face, burying deep in the curls of his blonde hair, threading through, pushing back.\nIt\u2019s not perfect. Far from it. Artless, clumsy, as if they don\u2019t fit exactly right together. But somehow that just makes Crowley push back deeper, hold onto him tighter. There\u2019s something almost addictive in the way he kisses him. It\u2019s as if it couldn\u2019t matter less that it wasn\u2019t exactly right, and he was going to kiss him until the universe understood that. And hell, maybe it is rather perfect.\nWith Crowley up on the counter he\u2019s got a good couple inches on Aziraphale and he takes the advantage, tilting his head to drag his tongue along his. The angel\u2019s hands catch around his waist suddenly, tugging him closer and Crowley\u2019s legs have hooked around the back of Aziraphale\u2019s legs just incase he tries to move away, but it certainly doesn\u2019t seem like he will, not with the way he\u2019s pushing his tongue deeper, hungrier.\nAziraphale tastes like wine. Well, they both must. Wine and a lamb and a bit of spice. But there\u2019s something else, something sweet that Crowley\u2019s fairly sure is just the angel. It matches the smell of his hair, and hazily Crowley thinks it might be clover, sweet but grassy and solid. Yes. Clover on a warm day out in some field that\u2019s got a good breeze and a brilliant amount of lazy summer sun.\nThey stay like that for a while, snogging in the kitchen like something out of some terrible American holiday romance, the breeze from the open windows pushing lazily across the wide floor.\nFinally, finally, Aziraphale pulls back. He doesn\u2019t go far, leaning his forehead back against Crowley\u2019s. He\u2019s short of breathe. Or maybe that\u2019s Crowley. Hard to be sure exactly. The angel\u2019s flushed, eyes hanging hazy as he looks back at him.\nHe drags a thumb across Crowley\u2019s cheekbone slowly. \u201cWell.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Crowley breathes back. He let\u2019s his hands slide up the angel\u2019s back, drifting under the line of his belt without thinking. \u201cInteresting?\u201d\nAziraphale laughs. \u201cInteresting.\u201d There\u2019s something wrong with his voice. Its got a bit more air to it than syllables.\n\u201cWhat do you want to, I mean\u2026\u201d Crowley starts awkwardly. His thumbs have found Aziraphale\u2019s hips and that\u2019s presenting a fresh series of sensations in the mysterious area behind his stomach that\u2019s become unusually active in the past ten minutes. \u201cI\u2019ve not, I mean, I don\u2019t actually know all that much about\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll manage,\u201d Aziraphale answers, and suddenly he\u2019s eyeing Crowley\u2019s neck with strange interest. He urges forward, kissing him just under his jaw and Crowley can\u2019t help letting out a little strangled groan.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Aziraphale asks without moving. Crowley laughs instantly in surprise and he feels the angel smile against him. \u201cThere I mean, up there.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Crowley says instantly, because he\u2019s not alright. He needs to be able to reach more of him, all of him. He has a shockinly powerful desire to be in his lap, warm legs under his rather than this cold counter.\nAziraphale hums something that might have been understanding, and then, without warning, picks him up.\nCrowley lets out a short surprised yelp, which lasts half a second before he realizes with a sharp dangerous thrill that Aziraphale has him by arse. His hands tighten and they\u2019re kissing again.\nThey hit the couch blindly. Aziraphale tosses a hand out to prevent completely crashing, just managing to end up back in the yielding leather. Crowley\u2019s in his lap already, which is just exactly right. The angel\u2019s head falls back with a gasp for breath. He\u2019s staring up at him with a dazed stunned expression, like there\u2019s a new color hanging around them he\u2019d never taken the time to notice.\nCrowley doesn\u2019t think. Thinking really isn\u2019t helping anything. And that\u2019s what this is supposed to be isn\u2019t it? Mortal, instant, instinctual. Stupid. At least that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to hold onto. So, he doesn\u2019t think. He cants his hips, grinding his undeniable erection against the hard hot line pressing behind Aziraphale\u2019s khakis.\nAziraphale makes a noise. A loud one. And suddenly Crowley realizes he\u2019ll do just about anything to hear it again.\nHe doesn\u2019t stop, catching a rhythm with the hips against him.\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201c Aziraphale tries, still blushing fiercely. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201c\n\u201cNice.\u201d Crowley finishes, shocked at the sound of his own voice. It\u2019s rough, broken, and the very opposite of collected. He didn\u2019t know he could sound like that.\nAziraphale swallows hard, head falling back against the couch with a desperately stifled moan.\nCrowley can\u2019t help looking down, eyes wide, unavoidably staring. He rocks his hips, the rhythm rolling through them far too easily. Amazing, human bodies. All these mysteries hiding just under the skin, just waiting for an excuse to flutter to the surface.\nAziraphale\u2019s hands are on his hips, his own rising up to meet him, keeping the pace, grinding them together with feverish insistence. Crowley gasps helplessly, stuttered sounds rolling around his tongue lost and jumbled. He lets his head fall back and suddenly Aziraphale\u2019s mouth is on his neck again and Crowley just manages to clamp down a moan.\n\u201cHave you always smelled this good?\u201d Aziraphale manages to breathe. Crowley can\u2019t help laughing short and rough, weaving his hands back into his hair.\nAziraphale kisses him again and again: the exposed lines of his collar bone, the taut cords of his neck, the delicate space behind his ear, the sharp cut of his jaw. Closed kisses. Chaste. And then Crowley tightens the grip in his hair and the angel\u2019s lips fall open, wet and warm, teeth catching, tongue darting out to trace greedily, thoughtless.\nCrowley\u2019s breathe flies out of him with a whine. His hand goes uncontrollably tight in Azirphale\u2019s hair and that just makes the angel\u2019s thumbs on his hip bones dig in a way that catches the gasp in Crowley\u2019s throat and twists it into a wrenched moan, which is decidedly unfair.\nCrowley sits up firmer, catching Aziraphale\u2019s wrists and pushing them behind his head as he urges the rest of the angel\u2019s body back against the pillows. He obliges, falling back for him, catching his lips again easily with a short moan.\nAmazing. He\u2019s known him so long, and suddenly there\u2019s so much more. He\u2019s known his laughs, his frowns, each individual way he fiddles with silverware at a restaurant, and exactly how his fingers trace pages at all hours of the day. But now\u2026 There\u2019s a whole new array of knowledge unfolding under his fingers, his lips, his hips. Noises he didn\u2019t know he had hidden inside of him flood to the surface, expressions unfolding without restraint, and suddenly Crowley has a greedy urge to know every single one of them just as well as everything else. He wants to learn this. exactly. Perfectly. And there\u2019s another feeling, one that never came with the other bits of familiarity.\nHis. He wants these to be his.\nHe\u2019s not exactly sure what that means, and he\u2019s positive there\u2019s at least five sins all caught up in that one desire, but the feeling of it twists and folds around his limbs, sinking in deep and hot, and suddenly there\u2019s no banishing it. He kisses him deeper and lets it soak him. His. His. His.\nCrowley swallows and tries firmly to slow the pace. Their starting to fall erratic and fast and he wants this to last. He manages to wrangle his thrusts down to rolls, easing his hips back and forth and Aziraphale hums against his lips, catching one of them between his teeth and teasing it in a way that makes Crowley\u2019s hands tighten on his wrists thoughtlessly. Crowley kisses him back, slow and deep, marveling and how the angel melts under him, tight muscles going soft and pliant.\nHe lets go of his wrists, sliding both hands up his neck and deep into his hair, moving his mouth from his lips to his jaw. He traces kisses, breathe hot and clammy against the angel\u2019s skin. He drops lower, opening his mouth against his neck and dragging his tongue quick and warm across the hammering pulse he finds there.\nThe tightness floods back into Aziraphale\u2019s limbs instantly, a strangled moan catching in his throat. \u201cCrowley\u2014\u201d his hips kick up, control forgotten, and suddenly Crowley\u2019s pulling back, eyes fierce on the angel\u2019s face as his hand scrambles down, pressing hard into the tight space between them, urging against Aziraphale\u2019s cock.\nAzirphale swears.\nIt\u2019s loud and careless and any possible hope Crowley might have had of being able to force this clambering heat out of his limbs, easy the tight low need in his gut, steady his breathe, and step away, flies instantly right out the window.\n\u201cGod -\u201c Azirpahale stammers. \u201cThat\u2019s, just\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI know,\u201d Crowley pants back, pressing the heel of his palm flat against him, sliding against the catch of khaki that\u2019s already a bit going damp under his fingers.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Aziraphale swallows. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d\nAnd then it\u2019s Crowley\u2019s turn to swear.\nAziraphale\u2019s hand finds him instantly, heavy and urgent, and Crowley\u2019s slacks the way he\u2019s sitting are far, far more obliging that Aziraphale\u2019s. The angel can actually get half a grip on him and he drags his hand down with firm insistence.\nCrowley\u2019s eyes shudder open, jaw hanging loose and lost. It\u2019s all he can do to keep decent pressure on the cock under his fingers, but god Azirphale seems suddenly drunk on the pleasure he\u2019s capable of inflicting on him and Crowley can\u2019t help giving into it. He sinks deeper into his lap, rolling his hips against the touch, wetting his lips once before lost sounds stagger out of him like reeling drunkards.\nAnd God what absolutely idiots they\u2019d been. Hundreds of years, thousands, and not knowing.\nWhat was the line, \u201cLove\u2019s not Time\u2019s Fool\u201d? Well, he felt fool enough. Something this, human, waiting, hiding, just a touch or a word away, needing only half a second to unlock and unfold such brilliance. So many years. But that couldn\u2019t matter. He wouldn\u2019t let it. They\u2019d stumbled into something now, clumsy incompetents that they were, and he didn\u2019t plan on stumbling out again.\nStrange how that worked. Thousands of years. Crusades, kingdoms, the odd apocalypse. And then one night, some wine, flatbread, a movie, glasses, kissing, touching. Strange. But then again, so very undeniably human. He supposes it would be impossible now to deny that it was rubbing off on them.\n\u201cThe way you look like this,\u201d Aziraphale says suddenly.\nCrowley realizes that his eyes are shut and eases them open again, meeting his eyes, panting against the insistent push of the angel\u2019s hand.\nAziraphale gazes back at him, breathless, stunned. \u201cMiraculous.\u201d\nCrowley feels something in his chest squeeze unexpectedly and he surges forward, kissing him again and trying to push everything he\u2019s too breathless to say through that, trying weave into him each and every word he never said, everything he\u2019s needed to say, everything he will one day find the courage to summon.\nAziraphale\u2019s hands are in his hair, sweeping across his cheek, easing up his neck, and holding on, as if he hears it all, and refuses to pretend otherwise.\nCrowley pulls back with a tight breathe. \u201cClothes.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Aziraphale agrees. He looks ready to practically set his shirt ablaze to vanish it, but Crowley gets to him first, snatching at his jumper and shirt and dragging both over his head. The angel\u2019s hair is a wreck, all those perfect curls jumbled and tossed. Crowley has the sneaking suspicion that the unprecedented lack of heavenly pristine probably has something to do with the way the angel\u2019s still grinding an erection against his thigh and he can\u2019t help feeling a guilty but powerful thrill at that thought.\nUnderneath all that wool and cotton Azirphale\u2019s impossibly warm, skin soft, yielding, smooth, and Crowley\u2019s brain goes a bit fuzzy suddenly at the feel of it under the length of his fingers, but Aziraphale doesn\u2019t give him much time to savor. The angel blinks and all the buttons on Crowley\u2019s shirt are open, Aziraphale\u2019s hands instantly sliding up underneath, sending a hard shiver through Crowley\u2019s limbs.\n\u201cBony,\u201d Aziraphale murmurs curiously, pushing an open kiss against his sternum.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Crowley manages.\nAziraphale nips at him reproachfully. It\u2019s all Crowley can do not to swear again.\n\u201cTrousers,\u201d he says, swallowing a groan.\nAziraphale grumbles hungrily and suddenly those are gone too. Along with whatever was underneath.\nCrowley\u2019s cheeks heat up instantly despite himself, flush creeping down his bare chest. Aziraphale doesn\u2019t seem to notice, leaning forward and darting his tongue against one dark nipple.\n\u201cAh\u2014\u201c Crowley stumbles, clutching at Aziraphale\u2019s back, shoulders, arms, anything. The angel\u2019s hand finds his cock again and wraps tight. Crowley just manages not to sob.\nAziraphale lets out a small huff of surprise against his chest at the feeling of Crowley\u2019s bared erection in his fingers, dragging the smooth length carefully up and down through his palm.\nCrowley bites his lip hard, desperate not to make a complete idiot out of himself, but his breathe is so jagged it\u2019s lost all constancy and he can\u2019t stop noticing the play of freckles on Aziraphale\u2019s back with this absurdly powerful impulse to memorize them. The tight feeling low in his gut is clutching hard and hot and dragging him towards something that feels dangerous and terrifying and so, so, tempting.\n\u201cI- I can\u2019t,\u201d Crowley tries. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014 I\u2019m close, too close,\u201d\nAziraphale\u2019s staring at him like something starved. \u201cThat\u2019s alright, it\u2019s alright.\u201d Crowley\u2019s shocked at how calm he can keep his voice, even if it almost shaking.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Crowley insists, swallowing. He looks him dead in the eyes and Aziraphale slows. \u201cThere\u2019s more. I want - I need more.\u201d\nAziraphale swallows, mouth opening against a hurried breathe, hand loosening around his cock.\n\u201cAlright?\u201d Crowley starts, \u201cIs that, al\u2014ahh--\u201d\nImpossibly slick fingers slip under him, slide against him in a tight circle. And oh\u2014 god\u2014!\n\u201cFuck\u201d Crowley pants, \u201c\u2014 Aziraphale,\u201d\nHis cheeks are hot again, blushing harder than he has any right to, but his hips stutter, sink, roll against the feeling and Aziraphale groans. He shifts his weight, edging to one side so his cock presses flush against Crowley\u2019s thigh, moving ever so slightly with each shallow jerk of Crowley\u2019s hips.\nCrowley stutters for breathe, shoving out one hand for purchase and catching it on Aziraphale\u2019s shoulder. Aziraphale stares up at him bewitched. He lets his tongue run over his lips and eases a finger up into him.\nCrowley\u2019s eyes shoot open, a gasp punching out of his chest.\nAziraphale urges deeper, fascinated. Crowley\u2019s hand tightens on his shoulder. His body\u2019s doing that thing again, whispering to him in a language he can\u2019t quite hear, but he tries to grasp at the corners of its meaning and tilts his hips slightly so Aziraphale\u2019s finger hits one spot\u2014\nThat\u2019s it. Crowley\u2019s lost and he\u2019s not sure he\u2019ll ever find his way back again. Sensation sizzles through him, sharp and greedy, and he isn\u2019t sure but he thinks he hears a voice cry out that sounded a lot like his.\nBefore he can properly grip the world again Aziraphale\u2019s adjusting, moving. He should be surprised. The angel always was a quick study when he wanted to be. Aziraphale curls his finger, adding slickness, dragging across that impossible spot again, and Crowley suddenly can\u2019t hold back a cry.\nHis knuckles are white tight on Aziraphale\u2019s shoulder. He\u2019s probably hurting him, and he hates that thought, hates it so much he\u2019s about to let go no matter what happens, but Aziraphale\u2019s huffing out a breathe and suddenly a second finger joins the first and strokes\u2014\nCrowley let\u2019s out a strangled sob, head falling forward onto the angel\u2019s forehead.\n\u201cAlright?\u201d Aziraphale asks, with so much care in his voice, so much breathless concern, that it actually hurts.\n\u201cGod,\u201d Crowley stumbles, lifting himself up on shaking thighs. \u201cYes.\u201d\nHe brings himself down again. Hard.\nAziraphale curses. Again. And Crowley\u2019s cock surges painfully at the sound of it. He feels the tip bob against Aziraphale\u2019s stomach, wet and warm. He feels the angel\u2019s own erection tight against his knee, and god he must be desperate for something, anything, but apparently it can wait because Aziraphale\u2019s pulsing his finger again, driving into him so exactly right.\nCrowley hisses, sharp and tight, letting his hips do whatever they want and sod the rest, rolling against the angel\u2019s fingers, slick and tight and fucking hell\u2014\nAziraphale\u2019s breathes are getting shorter, harder. His hand is so tight on Crowley\u2019s hip it\u2019s getting impossible to ignore. Crowley can feel the slickness his erection is dragging against his leg, the desperate tight pulses of it each time Crowley whines against the feeling.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Crowley manages, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I want, it\u2019s - just\u2014 please\u2014\u201c\nThe angel doesn\u2019t need anymore encouragement and Crowley let\u2019s out a startled gasp as the hands suddenly leave him completely, but they\u2019re only gone for a second. Aziraphale grips him firmly by the hips, turns him, pressing him down on his back into the leather of the couch.\nCrowley gasps surprise but Aziraphale steals it, kissing him again, and this time there\u2019s nothing close to restrained in it.\nIt\u2019s messy and heavy, wet and warm, all depth and drag, teeth and tongue. Crowley arches into him, the stick of the leather an almost unnoticeable side effect. He lets his legs fall even further apart, one hand gripping tight in the angel\u2019s hair, another sliding down his back, locking around his arse and pulling him closer.\nAziraphale\u2019s cock sweeps across his taut, slick skin and suddenly Crowley\u2019s taking action.\nHe snaps a hand between them, fingers suddenly slick and warm, wrapping them around Aziraphale\u2019s cock and guiding the tip to his entrance.\nAziraphale groans hard and desperate, forehead resting helplessly on his chest. Crowley locks his calves behind Aziraphale\u2019s thighs and pushes, urging the head of his cock inside him with a tight swear.\nA shocked sound punches out of the angel\u2019s chest and suddenly he\u2019s leaning hard on his elbows, one hand tight on Crowley\u2019s hip, pushing impossibly, miraculously \u2014\nCrowley\u2019s not sure who cries out first, or even who\u2019s voice is who\u2019s for that matter. The only thing that\u2019s left for him is the feeling, the heat, the stretch, and the sound of Aziraphale muttering his name, over and over, like some sort of impossibly heretical prayer.\nHe drags back and snaps his hips home again.\nCrowley cries out instantly: thoughtless, lost. Aziraphale does it again. And again. And again.\nOne of his hands has weaved through Crowley\u2019s, another\u2019s holding his cheek, firm and strangely innocent against all the rest of it. The rhythm pushes, the pulse of it surging them together without thought, and suddenly, strangely, Crowley feels so home that he can\u2019t breathe.\n\u201cCrowley, I\u2014 it\u2019s, ah\u2014!\u201d Azriaphale stammers, pace staggering into something erratic and frantic. The tightness low and deep inside is getting unbearable, terrifying. He\u2019s never felt anything like it. It feels as if he\u2019ll break in half if he doesn\u2019t let it out and he\u2019ll shatter to pieces if he does.\n\u201cCrowley,\u201d the voice presses, close, softer than it should be. \u201cLook at me.\u201d\nHe does.\nHe looks at him. All of him. Aziraphale\u2019s flushed cheeks, hair ruined, and eyes looking directly back at his own. Eyes his know, eyes he trusts impossibly more than anything else in the world. Crowley swallows. And he lets go.\nThe feeling smashes into him, brutal and impossible and so, so good he can\u2019t possibly imagine anything else.\nThe orgasm pulls through him, hot and electric. He feels his entire body tighten around it, surge and flex and suddenly Aziraphale\u2019s crying out as well, a half-sob falling out of him in a broken shout against Crowley\u2019s name and they\u2019re in it together, pushing, pulling, clinging, until finally, finally things stagger and slow.\nIt takes a while. Maybe more.\nCrowley\u2019s not sure how long he\u2019s lying there before his muscles start to unclench, ease back from the pinnacle now behind them. Aziraphale lets out a shaky sigh he feels against his shoulder and with laudable effort pulls back enough to fall back onto Crowley\u2019s chest.\nCrowley\u2019s skin\u2019s still alive with feeling, but strangely enough as the electricity eases out immense and implausible comfort slides in to replace it.\nHe finds himself humming quietly, sinking deeper into the leather. With a quick thought the mess is gone from around them and Aziraphale makes a soft grateful noise against his neck.\nCrowley\u2019s hand finds its way into his hair thoughtlessly, running through it with ease and care.\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d he mutters.\n\u201cMm, very.\u201d Aziraphale agrees rolling against the fold of his shoulder.\nCrowley tightens an arm around his neck and sighs, breathing in that summer-clover smell deeply. He glances at the television, the Netflix menu open and waiting.\n\u201cAnother movie?\u201d\nAziraphale turns his head enough to see the screen, one hand sliding down to rest on Crowley\u2019s hip, tracing the bone with a thumb idly. \u201cYou pick this time.\u201d\nCrowley smiles, edging the cursor through the options. He flicks on the first thing to catch his eye, and wonders idly how far they\u2019ll make it through this one before finding something better to take up their time."
