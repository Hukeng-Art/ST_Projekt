    "text": "  I    picture it soft, and I ache. \n\u00a0\nAziraphale wasn\u2019t entirely sure what he was expecting in the wake of the Armageddon-that-wasn\u2019t. For management upstairs to regroup and decide that, really, all things considered, it wouldn\u2019t do to have a rogue angel running around; for the Almighty to weigh his sins and turn his wings to black, his Grace to rot in his chest; for Adam to have a pubescent tantrum and decide to end the world, after all.\nBut really, things continued on much as they had before, as if the earth and all of humanity hadn\u2019t been moments away from destruction. The slow days creeped by, the heat of summer having finally peaked and begun the descent into a crisp and pleasant autumn, his favorite ice cream stand was taken over by one selling hot cider and cocoa, and no one appeared in a blaze of light to rain down divine or hellish wrath.\nThe only true change, apart from Adam\u2019s additions to his collection, was Crowley\u2019s near constant presence.\nAlthough they had hardly been strangers before, they were immortal beings, and time meant far less to them than it did to humans--even in recent years, days or weeks would often pass unremarked before they spoke again. Before the Antichrist\u2019s birth, there were whole years and, especially early on, even decades and centuries that would go by without any sort of contact. Yet ever since they stepped off the bus that brought them to London, seemingly by silent agreement, they had begun living in each other\u2019s pocket.\nThat first night, Aziraphale slept on a comfortable bed beneath an eiderdown duvet Crowley had brought into existence, shrinking his own terribly modern bed to make space for it in his room. He supposed Crowley could\u2019ve created a separate room for him, given that the whole flat was willed into existence where a janitor\u2019s closet had once been, or cleared the furniture from his sparse living room and had him sleep there, but he didn\u2019t seem willing to part, and Aziraphale felt much the same.\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d he said into the dark of the room. It smelled faintly of incense, but mostly of Crowley, and though the fluffy white comforter had only just been brought into existence, it smelled like him too. Aziraphale was more comforted by it than he would\u2019ve ordinarily admitted to himself, being too tired to will away the persistent feeling that something about Crowley settled him, made him feel  right . \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever really let me in your flat, and here I am, with my own bed.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been here,\u201d Crowley said irritably. \u201cYou were here earlier this year, we had brandy.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but only for a moment,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI came to meet you so we could see Come From Away in the West End, and you weren\u2019t ready yet.\u201d\n\u201cI was doing my hair!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a  demon ,\u201d he reminded him, exasperated. \u201cYou can just will your hair to do what you like, you don\u2019t have to use product.\u201d\n\u201cI like  doing it, it\u2019s never quite right if I manifest it,\u201d Crowley muttered, and Aziraphale rolled his eyes. \u201cJust because it\u2019s dark doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know you\u2019re rolling your eyes at me.\u201d\n\u201cYou have hellish night vision,\u201d Aziraphale huffed.\n\u201cDon\u2019t need it to know you\u2019re being an ass, angel,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cGo to sleep. I just did a bloody lot of heroic acts for a demon, and I need to sleep off all this righteousness.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAfter their brief stints in Heaven and Hell, returning to their own skins and dining together at the Ritz, there was a moment of hesitation as they finally left the building, standing at the curb beside the Bentley. Crowley looked at Aziraphale, brows raised above his glasses, and Aziraphale looked at Crowley, nerves buzzing in his stomach.\n\u201cI suppose you can drop me at the bookstore,\u201d he said, though the idea made his heart sink.\n\u201cYou could come back to mine again,\u201d Crowley said, after a moment. He swallowed, shifted his weight. Aziraphale was reminded of a cold night in the sixties, Crowley\u2019s voice gentle and vulnerable.\n\u201cI--well, I wouldn\u2019t want to intrude--overstay my welcome--\u201d\n\u201cJust come back to mine, angel, please,\u201d Crowley said, and he sounded exhausted, as if he was begging Aziraphale to cut to the end of it, to save him the convincing and reassuring. Aziraphale nodded, something sharp stuck in his throat, and that was that.\nThey established a routine. They spent most of their evenings at Aziraphale\u2019s bookshop, lounging in the back room as they often had before, drinking wine and bickering and reading to each other, which Crowley seemed to enjoy quite a lot for someone who claimed to loathe books, but once it reached midnight, Crowley would stand, and that was Aziraphale\u2019s cue to finish up his paragraph and collect their dishes. He would lead the way up the rickety staircase to the small flat upstairs, and Crowley would collapse in the bed he\u2019d manifested for himself--having quite rudely shoved aside Aziraphale\u2019s own to the far wall, which was admittedly rarely used before--while Aziraphale washed their glasses and plates in the small kitchen. Crowley would only take his sunglasses off once Aziraphale had turned out the lights, and they would sleep til morning, when they would go to whatever cafe or bistro they could agree on for breakfast, and while away the afternoon in St. James Park, or strolling through a public garden, or taking a country drive. They would bicker almost the whole day about where they would eat dinner, spend hours indulging in good food and fine wine, and return to either Crowley\u2019s flat or Aziraphale\u2019s bookshop, and so their days went, as the leaves turned and the days shortened, and Crowley\u2019s phone dinged with a photo of Adam in his Halloween costume--a witch, and Dog dressed as a black cat--and the windows began frosting in the morning, though the house plants Crowley had begun accumulating on the sill remained dutifully lush and healthy; Anathema wished them a happy Thanksgiving, with a long message about the inherent artifice and immorality of the holiday. And still Crowley stayed.\n Why?  Aziraphale wanted to ask him,  why millennia of the way things were, and now  this  ? \nBut while Crowley seemed to have little issue upending every unspoken rule they\u2019d ever written for themselves, Aziraphale was not so flexible, and they had spent thousands of years never quite addressing whatever it was  this  had stemmed from. Words, Aziraphale had always felt, were for bickering about where to eat for lunch, or hashing out ontological debates, or other trivial nonsense; there was no need to trifle with the imprecision of language, with phrasing and the possibility of being misconstrued, when it came to important matters if the other person simply understood, without needing it said. Six thousand years ago, when Aziraphale had met Crowley on the wall of Eden, watching the first two humans set out to begin the rest of history, something deep within him, more central even than his Grace, had thought,  oh, it\u2019s you,  and that had been enough for him--for both of them, he assumed--for three millennia.\nHowever much he wanted to ask, he didn\u2019t know how. The words simply weren\u2019t there.\nHe wasn\u2019t entirely sure why he didn\u2019t send Crowley away, or depart from dinner on his own one night, restore things to the way they had been. Occasional lunches, drinks in the back room, dinners at the Ritz; separate their lives once more. There was just--something deeply unpleasant, and, yes, terrifying, about the prospect of parting. And that was enough for him to put aside his six thousand years of reticence, and allow Crowley to fill all the empty spaces in his life, build a place for himself in every moment.\nAnd, he supposed, he did the same. There was now a pale tartan blanket thrown over Crowley\u2019s grey sofa and a number of fluffy throw pillows, a variety of appliances appearing in his kitchen--Crowley didn\u2019t even possess so much as an electric kettle for tea, the animal--a lamp casting a warm light in his--their--bedroom, beside Aziraphale\u2019s white bed so at odds with Crowley\u2019s black and grey scheme. Everywhere he looked in Crowley\u2019s flat, there was evidence of his presence there, and Crowley had infected every corner of Aziraphale\u2019s in kind. However intimate he had thought their lives together were before, this was nothing he had experienced or imagined. Everywhere he looked, there was Crowley.\nHe ought to have been unsettled, that he had allowed a demon to enter his life so fully, but he couldn\u2019t summon anything that was stronger than the contentment he felt scooping up Crowley\u2019s black coat from where he\u2019d thrown it on the dining table and hanging it in the coat closet, or making two cups of tea instead of one without thought, and without needing to ask how he took it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is this  oat milk  everyone keeps going on about?\u201d Aziraphale asked at the grocery store, turning a bottle of it around in his hands. \u201cIt seems everyday, they\u2019ve invented some new kind of milk. Have you tried it?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t start, angel,\u201d Crowley groaned, his forehead pressed against the cool glass of the refrigerated section, where it had been for several minutes. A woman with a toddler on her hip frowned at him. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to feed you without you turning  vegan  . Just get the normal milk and let\u2019s  go .\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re disturbing the other patrons, Crowley, really,\u201d Aziraphale said as Crowley breathed on the glass and pulled back to write \u2018help\u2019 in the condensation. \u201cYou have no sense of adventure. And there are different types of milk, different  brands . I was reading the paper this morning and I think we ought to switch to rBST-free milk, that artificial growth hormone isn\u2019t kind to the cows.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t kind to  me  ,\u201d Crowley whined. \u201cI don\u2019t even eat at home, what are we shopping for? Let's  go. \"\n\"You aren't as innocent as a cow, are you?\" Aziraphale said archly, and took up a carton claiming to be organic and grass-fed. \"You take milk in your tea, Crowley, this concerns you too. Do you think organic implies hormone free, or is that a separate category?\"\n\"I think I'd rather be discorporated than keep talking about this,\" Crowley said. \"Look, this one says grass-fed, hormone free, the cow in the picture is smiling, let's  go. \"\n\"Fine, fine,\" Aziraphale muttered, putting the milk he'd suggested in the basket. \"You have remarkably little patience for an immortal being, you know.\"\n\"Trust me, angel, I have  plenty of patience.\"\n\"Well, I've never seen it,\" Aziraphale muttered. \u201cCome on, then, before you get bored and start spoiling people\u2019s groceries.\u201d\n\u201cOo, I hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cGood idea, I\u2019ll try that next time we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cLord, give me strength,\u201d Aziraphale sighed, leading him to the front of the store.\nCrowley imitated him mockingly, and pulled out his phone. \u201cLook at this, I missed a call from Adam. Surprised the boy is still alive, I\u2019d have thought we\u2019d been here longer than a human lifespan.\u201d\n\u201c Really , Crowley, it was only a few minutes, and we needed food,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cWell. I wanted food. Go on, call him back, it could be important.\u201d\nCrowley was already putting the phone to his ear, and Aziraphale piled their groceries on the conveyor belt with a sheepish, \u2018what can you do\u2019 smile at the cashier. She returned it, scanning their groceries as Crowley listened to Adam chat excitedly on the other line, occasionally making noises to acknowledge that he was listening, or pitching in with suggestions of mischief and villainy. He offered his card to the cashier before Aziraphale could fish out his wallet, and though he knew money was no object to either of them, he felt warmth blossom in his chest and, he was certain, his cheeks, and he smiled at Crowley.\n\u201cYou two are cute,\u201d the cashier said, leaning in conspiratorially. \u201cYou remind me of my boyfriend\u2019s parents. Twenty years and they still go on dates!\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said, his cheeks reddening further, and he hoped Crowley wasn\u2019t listening. It sounded like he was very focused on talking Adam through how to break into a locked car. \u201cHow lovely. That\u2019s...very lovely,\u201d he muttered, and picked up his bags as quickly as he could, frustrated for reasons he couldn\u2019t quite identify when Crowley picked up the rest, still holding his phone in one hand.\n\u00a0\nAt the beginning of December, Aziraphale\u2019s phone rang, which it rarely did at this hour when Crowley was sitting right next to it, unless he\u2019d scrawled it on a bathroom stall with promises of bizarre work or sexual favors as a prank. He answered it apprehensively.\n\u201cAziraphale! It\u2019s Anathema,\u201d she said, as if he wouldn\u2019t recognize her voice. \u201cSorry it\u2019s so late, it\u2019s been a busy day.\u201d\n\u201cAnathema, dear girl!\u201d he cried. \u201cDon\u2019t worry at all. How is the winter treating you?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I suppose, much colder than back home,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d packed enough heavy clothes, but I suppose not. Listen, I\u2019m calling to invite you and Crowley over for a winter solstice celebration.\u201d\n\u201cWinter solstice celebration? Goodness me, it\u2019s been a fair few years since I\u2019ve attended one of those!\u201d he said, looking up to meet Crowley\u2019s eyes--well, his glasses. He looked intrigued as well. \u201cWhat, pray, will this entail?\u201d\n\u201cNothing you\u2019re imagining, I\u2019m sure,\u201d she laughed. \u201cAdam and his friends will be coming, so we\u2019ll just do dinner and gifts. It\u2019ll be my first winter solstice away from my mom. I have room for the two of you to stay with me, but Mr. Shadwell and Madame Tracy are staying at the inn in town if you\u2019d rather.\u201d\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s no need for that, we\u2019ll stay with you. This sounds lovely! We\u2019ll be there! The day of the solstice, then?\u201d Crowley raised one brow, and Aziraphale gave him a thumbs up.\n\u201cMight as well come the night before,\u201d she said. \u201cAdam\u2019s looking forward to seeing you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we him!\u201d\n\u201cThe twentieth, then,\u201d she said. They chatted for a few minutes, catching up on recent events--evidently, Newton had gotten a job at a local shop, and Adam was grounded for planting a stink bomb in his teacher\u2019s car--before her cat apparently attempted to swallow a piece of plastic, and she excused herself from the phone with a shriek.\n\u201cWhere, exactly, are we going on the winter solstice?\u201d Crowley drawled from the chaise he\u2019d draped his long limbs over.\n\u201cOh, dear me, I shouldn\u2019t have given your response without speaking to you first, that was terribly rude,\u201d he said, turning a bit red. He\u2019d sort of just...assumed. \u201cAh, Anathema has invited us over to hers for a solstice celebration. Adam and his friends will be there as well, and Mr. Shadwell and Madame Tracy.\u201d\nCrowley scowled. \u201cUgh, we\u2019ve got to spend the holidays with Tracy and  Shadwell ? Why didn\u2019t you just tell them we already have plans to, I don\u2019t know, sing carols and honor saints?\u201d\n\u201cBecause we don\u2019t,\u201d Aziraphale said irritably, his excitement fading. \u201cWell. I suppose you don\u2019t have to go,\u201d he told him, though the idea began to lose its shine when he pictured boarding the train to Tadfield and leaving Crowley behind for the holidays.\nCrowley frowned, as if he hadn\u2019t considered the possibility either, and didn\u2019t like it any more than Aziraphale did. \u201cNo,\u201d he said at last. \u201cCan\u2019t leave you alone with that ridiculous bastard, can I? I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll find a way to send you back into Heaven\u2019s jaws somehow. Besides, can\u2019t have you being a good influence on Adam without me there to balance it out. The twentieth, then?\u201d\nAziraphale beamed at him. \u201cThe twentieth! Oh, Crowley, we\u2019ve got to start shopping, I can\u2019t believe we waited this long. What do you think Newton would like? History, perhaps? Oh, I don\u2019t know him terribly well, we could ruin everything if it\u2019s wrong\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe winter continued, and nothing changed; or rather, everything continued to change. Aziraphale began to make two cocoas every evening when they returned home, Crowley\u2019s piled with marshmallows over the rim of the mug, and Crowley always had to remind Aziraphale of his before it got cold, and he would collect them both when they were empty, returning them to the cupboard miraculously clean.\nAziraphale continued his new, post-Armageddon hobby of knitting, tutting over dropped stitches and muttering patterns so he wouldn\u2019t forget. Crowley had recently downloaded Growtopia on his phone, and was determined to completely ruin the game\u2019s economy by the holidays. They fought over how warm they would set the thermostat--Crowley, being cold-blooded, demanded that it should be stifling, while Aziraphale, who enjoyed a chilly room so he could wrap himself up in warm clothes and a mound of blankets, disagreed completely--and the music they would play on Aziraphale\u2019s old phonograph. They read the paper in the mornings, trading comments about human politics, and they often went to see shows on weekday evenings, when the crowds would be thinner, and everyday Aziraphale willed himself to be discomforted by what his life had become, and everyday, he found himself more and more incapable of living without the comfort of Crowley\u2019s presence on the sofa beside him, or just in the next room.\n\u00a0\nWhen the twentieth came, they loaded the Bentley with the boxes of presents and their suitcases, the good car dutifully accommodating all their cargo, and set out for the village. Crowley complained that Aziraphale had given so many books, insisting that nobody read  books anymore, and Aziraphale replied that he didn\u2019t think an upstanding eleven year old such as Adam had much use for a leather jacket, did he? and Queen blared just a touch too loud for Aziraphale\u2019s taste all the way, while Crowley drove just a touch too slowly for his own taste.\nThey arrived at Jasmine Cottage in the afternoon, and the sunny day had clouded over and begun to snow, just a light dusting that turned everything pale and shiny, like new--though, of course, Crowley and Aziraphale had been there when the world was new, and there was no snow at the time. Crowley parked by the gate, and when they opened the doors, the curtain over the kitchen window swished, and a dog began barking inside. The door burst open and Adam ran out, grinning, Dog at his heels.\n\u201cAdam!\u201d Aziraphale crowed. They hadn\u2019t seen him since Armageddon was averted, but they had talked to him on the phone plenty, and he was constantly sending Crowley photos and videos on his mobile phone. It had seemed easy to keep in contact with him, as if they had been in his life all eleven years--as if they were  meant to be his godfathers, and he their godson.\n\u201cHey, Aziraphale!\u201d He leaned against the gate, eyeing Crowley as he lifted a box of presents from the backseat. \u201cAre all those for me?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, of course not,\u201d Aziraphale said, laughing. Adam pouted. \u201cA few are, of course, but there are  others coming to Christmas, you know.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Christmas,\u201d he said, lowering his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t call it Christmas, Anathema doesn\u2019t like it. It\u2019s winter solstice, which is the longest day of the year, but it only gets better from today, she says. Or tomorrow, I guess. Hey, can I have my presents tonight?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait like everyone else,\u201d Crowley called to him, but gave a wicked smile. \u201cUnless you sneak a peek, of course. Guess no one could stop you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t start, you old serpent,\u201d Aziraphale said, picking up his suitcase and one of the boxes.\n\u201cWhaaaaat, just want to make sure he knows his options,\u201d Crowley said, and Aziraphale shook his head. Adam opened the gate for them, and tried to take the box of gifts from Aziraphale, eyes far too wide and innocent, but he pulled away with a tsk.\nAnathema appeared from the house, smiling at them on the porch. \u201cI was worried about you driving in when it started to snow,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNo need,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cThe Bentley won\u2019t crash. Nothing short of the apocalypse itself can best that car.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Anathema said, following them through the door with a laugh. \u201cYou can put the gifts under the Yule tree.\u201d\n\u201cLooks like a Christmas tree to me,\u201d Crowley said, just to be contrary, and Aziraphale swatted his arm.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Yule tree,\u201d Anathema said, pursing her lips. \u201cCome on, your room is up this way.\u201d\n\u201cRoom?\u201d Aziraphale said, but followed her up a narrow staircase to the landing above, and she opened one of the doors.\n\u201cSorry it\u2019s a bit small,\u201d she said, in that frank way she had that said,  sorry only in the sense that I can\u2019t change it, but since I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t particularly care and I expect that you shouldn\u2019t either. \u201cIt\u2019s the spare room.\u201d\nIt was, in fact, a single spare room. The ceiling was slanted, the two sides coming together above the four-poster bed, curtained with gauzy fabric that shifted in the airflow from the vents on the floor. A wardrobe was in one corner, and a chair in the other, and there was hardly room to walk on either side of the bed. The one, singular bed in the room. Aziraphale didn\u2019t look at Crowley behind him.\n\u201cThe sheets are clean. Be careful that you don\u2019t leave the lamp on too long, or it\u2019ll catch fire,\u201d she told them. \u201cOld wiring. I\u2019ll go put the kettle on.\u201d\n\u201cActually, cocoa if you have it, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Crowley murmured, sounding distracted. \u201cLots of marshmallows in one, just two in the other.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of those,\u201d she said. \u201cAdam piles his cup full of them, turns the whole thing into soup.\u201d The floor creaked as she left, and Aziraphale and Crowley stood completely still in the room until they could hear clanging in the kitchen and Adam\u2019s voice chattering excitedly.\nAziraphale cleared his throat and ventured into the small room, putting his old and worn leather suitcase on the bed. It wasn\u2019t anything, really; it was just a few nights, and it was hardly different from sleeping in separate beds in the same room. After a moment, he heard Crowley follow him, his suitcase\u2019s wheels rolling loudly on the wood floors. Aziraphale began putting his clothes away in the wardrobe, and finally met Crowley\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cAre you going to put your clothes away?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt would save us room, if we could keep the suitcases under the bed.\u201d  This is nothing,  he was saying without saying.  Not even to be remarked upon. \nCrowley just looked at him, quirked one brow, and then nodded, swinging his own absurdly large black case onto the bed.  If you say so. \nAziraphale began chattering about how lucky it was that it had snowed just in time for their celebration, and how wonderful it was going to be to see everyone again, and Crowley argued that he could go the rest of his infinite days without seeing Shadwell and be happier for it, and Aziraphale reminded him that it wasn\u2019t entirely Shadwell\u2019s fault that he\u2019d sent him through the gateway, he really didn\u2019t know, and they continued bickering until Adam came thundering up the stairs to demand what was taking so long.\n\u00a0\nThey sat at Anathema\u2019s table catching up until the sun began to set behind the white clouds, and walked with Adam to his parent\u2019s house to have dinner. Aziraphale had reminded Crowley that to normal humans with no knowledge of the supernatural or divine, it was terribly strange for two men to suddenly show up acting like their child\u2019s godfathers, and even with Adam\u2019s unintentional reality-bending persuasion to accept them, it would do them well to keep in their good graces. Crowley had reluctantly agreed, and so the three of them walked in the snow, Aziraphale carrying a wonderfully decorated cake he had manifested when he realized they\u2019d forgotten to make something, and Crowley carrying two boxes of Christmas gifts under his arm.\n\u201cMy parents are alright, really,\u201d Adam assured them.\n\u201cWasn\u2019t worried about it,\u201d Crowley said, though both of them knew that he was, just a little.\n\u201cThey seem nice on the phone!\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cI do hope they enjoy their gifts. I\u2019d hate it if they got a bad impression of us, and forbade us from speaking to you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to get a restraining order if Mrs. Young doesn\u2019t like her blouse,\u201d Crowley pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Worst case, I\u2019ll make them like us.\u201d\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t!\u201d Aziraphale cried, eyes flickering to Adam between them. \u201cAdam is right here, Crowley, and you\u2019re talking about  influencing  his parents.  Really .\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with it,\u201d Adam said as they arrived at his house. \u201cJust don\u2019t make them weird or anything.\u201d Crowley stuck his tongue out at Aziraphale in victory, and Aziraphale rolled his eyes, wishing that he wasn\u2019t carrying the cake so he could make sure his bow tie was straight. What an impression that would be, a crooked tie .\nCrowley leaned over and fixed the lapel of Aziraphale\u2019s coat. \u201cCan\u2019t have you ruining our reputations,\u201d he said with a grin.\nAdam opened the door, calling out, \u201cMum, dad, Crowley and Aziraphale are here!\u201d\n\u201cGoodness me, you\u2019re a bit early, aren\u2019t you,\u201d Mrs. Young said, appearing from the kitchen. \u201cDinner isn\u2019t quite ready yet, but--my Lord, is that a cake?\u201d\n\u201cWe thought the occasion called for it,\u201d Aziraphale said, passing it to her with a humble smile. She led them to the dining room, placing it in the center of the table with wide eyes. \u201cNow, where should we put the gifts?\u201d\n\u201cGifts?\u201d Mr. Young called from the kitchen. \u201cGood lord, Deirdre, were we supposed to get them gifts?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not at all necessary,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cWe just thought we\u2019d pick something up! Oh, I\u2019m Aziraphale, and this is--\u201d\n\u201cCrowley,\u201d he said, flashing a big smile at Mrs. Young. \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner? Smells delicious.\u201d\n\u201cLasagna,\u201d Mrs. Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s my husband\u2019s favorite thing to make. Is that alright?\u201d\n\u201cSounds fantastic,\u201d he said, and managed to make it sound genuine. Crowley had never had much appreciation for food, Aziraphale knew. Good alcohol, certainly, but he almost never ate unless it was with Aziraphale. Aziraphale was much more apprehensive about the quality of Mr. Young\u2019s lasagna; he was all too familiar with what passed as English cooking.\nA timer beeped, and Mr. Young made a sound of satisfaction, clanging around as he, presumably, pulled the pan out of the oven. \u201cPerfect, perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cDeirdre, put down a trivet, will you?\u201d\n\u201cAlready done, dear!\u201d she called. \u201cOh, I suppose I\u2019ll take the presents, Crowley, if you like.\u201d\nMrs. Young laid them gently on a table in the hallway, and Mr. Young appeared with a steaming pan of lasagna, a proud grin on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re in for a treat, lads,\u201d he said. \u201cSecret family recipe!\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait!\u201d Aziraphale said, and tried to sound like he meant it. The whole room stank of hamburger now.\nAdam helped his mother set the table, and Mr. Young brought out a salad and a basket of rolls. The five of them sat, Crowley and Aziraphale facing the Young parents, Adam at the head.\n\"Help yourselves!\" Mrs. Young said, and Aziraphale set to serving himself and Crowley both, as he knew Crowley wasn't particularly adept at judging portions. Usually they were brought to him at a restaurant, and he ate a few bites before passing the rest to Aziraphale.\n\"So Adam tells us you're that young woman Anathema's godfathers, then?\" Mr. Young said, after a few minutes of quiet eating and congratulations to the chef. It was just as bland as Aziraphale had feared, but he soldiered bravely on. Gabriel would've been proud, he suspected, if he'd put half the devotion he gave to those performative noises of appreciation towards his heavenly duties.\n\"Ah,\" he said, glancing at Crowley out of the corner of his eye.\n\"Yes, good woman, Anathema, her grandma Agnes did a lot for us,\" Crowley said easily.\n\"How did you come to be an American's godfathers?\" Mrs. Young asked, with a touch more suspicion than Aziraphale cared for.\n\"I told you, mum, her mum's from London too,\" Adam said. \"Dad, this is really good. Your best lasagna yet!\"\n\"I think you're right, Adam, I think you're right,\" Mr. Young said. \"Save room for that cake, though, son, it looks professional. Did you get it from a shop?\"\n\"Yes, back in London,\" Aziraphale said, because he couldn't very well say he'd replicated it from a television program Anathema had on in the background. \"Tell me, how did you two meet?\"\nThey told a very long story about a college class and a bar they both attended and a concert in the north canceled due to rain, which Aziraphale thoroughly enjoyed, because he always enjoyed a good love story, though Crowley kept rudely and unnecessarily freezing time to make faces at Aziraphale and Adam.\n\"How did the two of you meet, then?\" Mrs. Young said finally, sharing a dreamy expression with her husband.\n\"Well,\" Aziraphale said slowly. \"We were in a garden, both of us taking strolls, and we just sort of\u2026bumped into each other, I suppose, introduced ourselves, starting chatting, and the rest is history.\"\n\"How positively romantic,\" Mrs. Young said, and Aziraphale started.\n\"I'm sorry?\" He said delicately.\n\"Well, Arthur and I just met in school like anyone else, a garden sounds like something out of a story,\" she said.\n\"It's  the story, Deirdre,\" Crowley drawled, passing a sharp grin to Aziraphale. \"The very first.\"\n\u00a0\nThey left the Young residence at Adam's bedtime, walking close together through the powdery snow. Aziraphale's chest felt warm, pleased at how well the dinner had gone, and his hand kept brushing Crowley's as he swung his arm between them.\n\"Well, that went well,\" Crowley said, echoing Aziraphale's own thoughts. His voice was soft, the blanket of snow quieting every sound.\n\"Yes, quite well,\" he said, and hummed. \"Seem like good people, the Youngs.\" His hand brushed Crowley's again, and something in his chest jolted--surprise at the sudden contact, he supposed.\n\"Must be, to raise the Antichrist to tell Satan himself to shove it.\" Another brush of contact, another jolt in his chest. Aziraphale smiled.\n\"Yes, must be,\" he agreed. Another brush of hands. He supposed he should move away, but it was nothing, and Jasmine Cottage was just down the street, and his mood was too high to care too much.\nAnother brush of hands, and Crowley cleared his throat, a wet and rough sound. His next step was just a little away from Aziraphale, and their hands didn't brush again.\nHe let them into Anathema's home quietly, mindful that she had told them she would be out performing a ritual and Newt had to wake up early for his shift. The stairs, quite miraculously, did not creak as they ascended them.\nThe spare room looked even cozier and more intimate in the dim light of the single lamp, and the warmth in Aziraphale's chest seemed to solidify and ooze into his stomach, nerves bubbling like cocoa in the pan before the milk is added. He exchanged his clothes for pajamas with a snap of his fingers.\nCrowley seemed frozen, looking sightlessly somewhere just above the bed--perhaps out the window--and Aziraphale shifted his weight.  It's nothing,  he reminded himself. No different from sharing two beds in one room. He climbed under the covers and looked up at Crowley expectantly.\n\"If you're not ready for bed, we'll have to go downstairs,\" he said, feeling terribly awkward. Crowley turned his unseeing gaze to Aziraphale. \"The lamp, remember.\"\nHe made a noise of agreement, and switched his own clothes for pajamas as well, settling himself carefully beside Aziraphale beneath the quilt. Aziraphale turned out the lamp, and heard Crowley take his glasses off, setting them on the windowsill behind the bed.\nIt was funny, all this awkwardness over sleeping arrangements, given that Aziraphale had never really slept terribly often before he and Crowley had begun sharing their time like this. He knew Crowley slept every night at least, sometimes for days or weeks--a whole century, even, from time to time--but unless he'd had a particularly taxing time of it, Aziraphale almost never slept. He didn't see the point, when he could spend the night reading or exploring or meeting interesting people in interesting late-night food establishments.\nBut he did see something to it now, he supposed. The routine of going to bed each night when Crowley did, rising together and starting the day with rituals of coffee and breakfast and the morning paper.\n\"You know,\" Crowley drawled in the dark. \"We didn't meet the first time on the wall.\"\n\"What?\" Aziraphale frowned, searching his long memory. \"Of course we did.\"\n\"Well, we spoke the first time, I suppose, but I already knew who you were. Didn't need an introduction,\" he said.\nAziraphale was quiet. \"When did we meet, then?\"\n\"I saw you guarding the tree,\" Crowley said, his voice sounding soft. \"Trying to entertain Eve throwing your sword around. Chatting about her baby.\" He paused. \"You looked at me in the brush and said, 'oh, hello, Snake,' and I didn't know what to think. And then I,\" he stopped again.\n\"Yes?\" Aziraphale prompted, and he felt like his heart had stopped beating, waiting with the rest of his body and his soul for Crowley to continue speaking.\n\"Dunno,\" he said at last. \"Waited for you to get on and then I corrupted Eve, I suppose. She told me your name. Said you were a terribly nice fellow.\"\n\"Oh,\" Aziraphale said, disappointed for reasons he couldn't explain. \"That was kind of her.\"\nCrowley said nothing to that, and they lay still for what felt like hours, Aziraphale's mind racing with confused and formless thoughts.\nJust as he finally drifted to sleep, he heard Crowley murmur into the dark, his voice thick and so quiet, Aziraphale almost couldn't hear it over the hum of the heater. \"I noticed your eyes, angel. Big and open and blue like the sky.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAziraphale woke in the morning with hair in his face and someone's breath on his neck. His eyes blinked open slowly, and when he tried to move, he realized his limbs were entwined with Crowley\u2019s, his face pressed into the crook of Aziraphale\u2019s neck. Though he was taller, he had bent so he could press as much of his body into the warmth of Aziraphale\u2019s, like a snake sunning. Aziraphale smiled into the crown of his head, and closed his eyes. When he opened them again, some hours later, Crowley was gone and the bed was cold.\n\u00a0\nShadwell and Madame Tracy arrived that evening in a flurry, having to chase down their taxi twice to retrieve forgotten items. Madame Tracy wrapped Aziraphale in an uncomfortably tight hug, and Shadwell clapped a hand on Newton Pulsifer\u2019s shoulder, loudly reminding him, definitely not for the first time, that he was supposed to  find  and  eliminate  witches, not play  house with them.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Newt said nervously, \u201caren\u2019t you supposed to find and eliminate them, and not attend their winter solstice celebrations?\u201d\nShadwell narrowed his eyes at Newt, then burst out laughing, throwing an arm around him. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas, laddie, we don\u2019t celebrate witch\u2019s holidays. Now come on, bring me inside, I want to know what\u2019s for dinner!\u201d Anathema rolled her eyes and led them in.\nCrowley and Aziraphale were responsible for much of the meal, as neither Newt or Anathema were particularly adept cooks, and though Adam\u2019s friend Wensley insisted his mother was teaching him how to make lots of good and healthy meals, none of them were quite comfortable trusting an eleven year old with an entire holiday banquet.\nIt felt odd, having everyone together again for the first time since what was nearly Armageddon. Pepper and Crowley were engaged in a lively discussion about the morality of assassination, which prompted Aziraphale to kick Crowley under the table multiple times. Wensley kept trying to convince Shadwell that witches, should they exist--Anathema, the most obvious example of a supposed witch, being an occultist--really probably weren\u2019t that bad anyway, and probably should be left alone, which entertained Anathema greatly.\nAdam kept trying to guess at what presents Crowley and Aziraphale had gotten him, growing more and more outlandish as he went. He\u2019d gone from a new bicycle to a baby dragon for Dog to play with.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d Newt told him. \u201cMy godparents always got me just one gift together, they said married people only had to buy one gift. Never made any sense to me, you\u2019d think with two incomes but just one household, they ought to buy  more gifts. Not, er, that it\u2019s all about the gifts, of course,\u201d he said, with a sidelong glance at Aziraphale.\n\u201cWell, we aren\u2019t married,\u201d Aziraphale said nervously, beginning to wonder why, exactly, even their friends seemed to think they were together, and wondering even more why he cared, \u201cbut I suppose even if we were, we would still get him a few gifts. He\u2019s our godson, after all, he gets a bit of special treatment.\u201d\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t married?\u201d Anathema said, brows knitting together. \u201cBut I thought\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAngels and demons don\u2019t get married,\u201d Crowley interrupted, his voice tight. \u201cDoesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\u201cBut, it\u2019s legal now,\u201d Madame Tracy said. \u201cI read it in the paper, all those lovely parades persuaded them.\u201d\n\u201cParades?\u201d Aziraphale asked, confused as to how, exactly, he managed to miss parades of angels and demons in the streets.\n\u201cYes, with all the rainbows and glitter,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have missed them, loud as they are!\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes, the pride parades,\u201d Aziraphale said, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure it was the  parades that did it, but, well that isn\u2019t precisely the issue.\u201d\n\u201cIs it Heaven and Hell?\u201d Pepper interrupted. \u201cI bet Adam could make them let you. Couldn\u2019t you, Adam?\u201d\n\u201cIt isssn\u2019t  like that ,\u201d Crowley hissed, losing his patience, and Aziraphale patted his hand reassuringly where it lay on the table, but Crowley yanked it back, scowling at him. \u201cWhy doess it matter? Don\u2019t you people have anything elssse to talk about?\u201d Aziraphale felt as though he\u2019d lost all footing in the conversation.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Madame Tracy said slowly, pity clear in her voice. She exchanged a look with Shadwell--well, she tried to, but the man looked almost as confused as Aziraphale was. \u201cSo sorry dear, of course.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Anathema said, giving them a peculiar look. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s just that Agnes said...well, I should\u2019ve asked before I gave you a room together, I just assumed--\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d Adam interrupted, with that finality in his voice which was well beyond his years. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else.\u201d\n\u201cMy dad wrecked our car,\u201d Brian said helpfully. \u201cIt didn\u2019t explode like I thought it would, but my mum was still really mad.\u201d\n\u201cHow about presentss?\u201d Crowley said, the hiss in his voice less pronounced. \u201cEveryone finished? Yess, good, presents, then.\u201d He waved his hands and the remaining food on the table disappeared, the dishes flying back into Anathema\u2019s cupboards miraculously clean.\nThe four kids sprang up, dashing into the living room to rifle under the Yule tree for the boxes with their names. The adults got up more slowly, the awkwardness palpable in the air, and Aziraphale tried to catch Crowley\u2019s eye, to communicate his amused--that\u2019s what that fluttery, pleasant-yet painful feeling in his stomach was, certainly--exasperation in their silent way, but Crowley wouldn\u2019t look at him, and Aziraphale followed him into the living room, feeling wrong-footed and hollow.\nThe gifts were distributed quickly, if chaotically thanks to the children, and when Aziraphale handed his gift to Crowley, the demon frowned at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cYour gift, of course,\u201d Aziraphale said, giving him a bright smile.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said. He handled it gingerly, like it was fragile--or maybe explosive--and Aziraphale\u2019s smile dimmed.\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he asked hesitantly. He knew their conversation in the other room had been awkward, but he wasn\u2019t going to rescind the gift he\u2019d worked so hard on. He wasn\u2019t even sure why it had  been so awkward, they\u2019d been mistaken for a couple by humans who didn\u2019t understand what it was to know someone as truly and as long as they had known one another a thousand times before. It really shouldn\u2019t be any different.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Crowley said, his expression, for the first time in probably five thousand years, unreadable. \u201cI suppose I rather thought we\u2019d have Christmas just the two of us.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my dear, I thought we\u2019d do it with the--\u201d  the family , he supposed would be how a human would put it, but they weren\u2019t human, and they didn\u2019t have a family, really. Just each other. \u201cWith the others.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cRight. Sorry, angel.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all, dear, not at all,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cI can keep it until we return to London, if you like--\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Crowley said, snatching the box back. \u201cI\u2019m opening it now.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how that\u2019s fair,\u201d Aziraphale argued, \u201cgiven that I don\u2019t get  my gift now.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the gifts, angel, it\u2019s about the reason for the season, and the thought, and all that,\u201d Crowley said, and began tearing at the paper.\nAziraphale rolled his eyes indulgently, passing out the rest of the gifts and sneaking little glances at Crowley as he struggled with the box. He\u2019d worked so hard on it, searched all the best yarn shops in London for the perfect skeins. He even had to sit on hold for hours with the manufacturer of the yarn he chose because he needed another skein from the same dye-lot, knowing that Crowley would want only the best, and he\u2019d notice even a minor inconsistency in the coloring.\n\u201cAngel,\u201d Crowley said, and Aziraphale turned to face him fully. He\u2019d taken the sweater out of the box, and laid it on his lap, smoothing his hands over the front.\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Aziraphale asked anxiously. The others--except Adam\u2019s friends--had paused in their unwrapping to watch. Crowley snapped his fingers, and the shirt he had been wearing was replaced with the sweater. \u201cIt\u2019s mohair, the best I could find.\u201d The yarn was pitch black, the halo of fuzz seeming to blur Crowley\u2019s outline, make him look immaterial and soft around the edges. Ethereal, almost.\n\u201cIs this what you\u2019ve been hiding?\u201d Crowley asked, lips quirking up in a smile. \u201cSneaking out of the room to do when you think I\u2019m not paying attention?\u201d\n\u201cWell--yes,\u201d Aziraphale said, turning a bit red. \u201cI thought I was being quite discrete, actually. Does it fit?\u201d\n\u201cLike a glove,\u201d Crowley said, and flashed him a smile. \u201cThanks, angel.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, dear boy,\u201d Aziraphale murmured. \u201cRight. Adam, you haven\u2019t opened my gift to you yet, have you?\u201d\nThe rest of them picked up where they had left off. Aziraphale had given Adam a thick blue sweater--not, tragically, made by hand, as he hadn\u2019t had enough time to knit everything--a white scarf that he  had knitted himself, and the full set of Percy Jackson books. Although Aziraphale himself wasn\u2019t a terribly big fan of most modern fiction--or, of course, paganism--he knew from their many conversations about books that Adam would probably like the story of an ordinary boy born from extraordinary stock, thrust into a role he wasn\u2019t prepared to occupy and yet, inexplicably, was the perfect person for.\nCrowley had given Adam an outrageously expensive and, he had assured Aziraphale, equally outrageously cool leather jacket, which Aziraphale had thought was quite ridiculous on its own, but then Crowley said, \u201ccheck the pocket,\u201d with a lazy and wicked smile, and Adam pulled out a small key with a Triumph keychain.\n\u201cCrowley, my dear,\u201d Aziraphale said slowly, \u201cwhat is that?\u201d\n\u201cThe key to Adam\u2019s motorbike, of course,\u201d Crowley said, turning that grin on him, and Aziraphale gasped, but the sound was drowned out by the sound of the children shrieking with joy, Adam\u2019s friends crowding around him.\n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Adam cried.\nCrowley waved his hand, then pointed out the window to the street. \u201cOutside,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the Bentley.\u201d\nThe children raced outside, and Aziraphale bustled after them, swatting Crowley on the arm when he caught up. \u201cYou wicked old serpent!\u201d he cried. \u201cA motorbike? He\u2019s  eleven .\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s plenty small for him,\u201d Crowley assured him. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll get bigger as he needs it to.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll kill himself!\u201d Aziraphale gaped at the offending vehicle, a sleek black thing that absolutely radiated mischief and tomfoolery, except for the little sidecar that looked to be about the perfect size for a small dog, which was just plain cute.\n\u201cRelax, angel, do you really think I\u2019d just give him a motorbike without taking precautions?\u201d he sighed. \u201cIt\u2019ll never wreck, not ever, and even if it does, he\u2019ll escape miraculously unharmed.\u201d\nAziraphale shook his head, snapping his fingers to manifest a white helmet that dangled from one of the handlebars. \u201cI\u2019ll see to that,\u201d he muttered. The helmet had strict instructions to keep the boy safe no matter what, or there would be a terrible divine retribution the likes of which Earth hadn\u2019t seen in thousands of years. \u201cHonestly, Crowley.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly what, angel?\u201d Crowley said, rolling his head to look over at Aziraphale. \u201cLook at him, he\u2019s happy, and he\u2019ll always be safe on it, everyone wins.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019m not human,\u201d he huffed. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t, I\u2019d have been dead ages ago from the stress you put me under.\u201d\n\u201cIf you were human, you\u2019d have been dead about five thousand, nine hundred, and thirty years ago,\u201d Crowley said, and Aziraphale pressed his lips together.\nThey watched the children fawn over the motorbike for a while, the other adults smiling indulgently at them, and Aziraphale couldn\u2019t help but peek at Crowley\u2019s face. He wore the smallest and most content smile Aziraphale had ever seen on him, as if all he had ever wanted these six thousand years was to see Adam grinning wildly like an eleven year old should, as if he had no concerns but how he was going to hide his new and certainly forbidden gift from his parents. Then he looked down at Aziraphale, and the smile grew even softer, and Aziraphale couldn\u2019t help but return it, his disapproval melting away like snow under the springtime sun.\n This is what it was all for,  he thought hazily.  This moment. That smile. \nHe only wished he could see Crowley\u2019s eyes.\n\u00a0\nThere was more food after all the presents had been opened, and the conversations were easier, mostly revolving around the children\u2019s gifts--and Shadwell\u2019s, a collection of letters from various Witchfinders Aziraphale had laying around that he\u2019d bound into a book for the strange old man--and as devoid of awkward moments as any family dinner could be.\nAziraphale was relaxed when he and Crowley finally retired, the awful tension of dinner completely forgotten after the festivities, and he hummed as he readied himself for bed.\nOnce he was dressed in his pajamas, he eyed Crowley, who was still dressed, sitting on the edge of the bed in his absurdly, distractingly tight jeans and his new sweater. \u201cAre you ready for bed, my dear?\u201d he asked. \u201cI can make a light of our own if you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m ready,\u201d Crowley murmured, snapping his fingers to change into his silky black pajamas. \u201cDid you really knit that sweater by hand? The whole thing?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Aziraphale said, frowning. \u201cThere isn\u2019t much I could think of to get you that you couldn\u2019t create from nothing yourself, so I thought I\u2019d make you something the long way. Thinking about it now, I suppose it doesn\u2019t make much of a difference, you\u2019ve got another black sweater either way--\u201d\n\u201cIt does make a difference,\u201d Crowley said, and he smiled almost as he had outside in the snow, that soft and small thing Aziraphale would do anything to see again. \u201cThanks, angel.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Crowley,\u201d he said, and patted his hand as he got under the covers. Crowley waved a hand to turn off the lamp, and Aziraphale heard him take off his sunglasses.\n\u201cCrowley?\u201d he said softly, after a long moment.\n\u201cYeah, angel?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to wear your sunglasses all the time, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cNot--not when it\u2019s just you and me.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t wear them all the time,\u201d Crowley said. He sounded strained, and Aziraphale could picture the way his jaw was clenched, his brow furrowed, even if he couldn\u2019t see it in the dark.\n\u201cYou take them off when we\u2019ve been drinking,\u201d he allowed. \u201cBut any other time, you wait til it\u2019s dark.\u201d\nCrowley was quiet. \u201cMaybe I just don\u2019t want you seeing them.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Aziraphale frowned. \u201cI know what they look like. I know you\u2019re a demon, it doesn\u2019t shock me to see them.\u201d\n\u201cYess it doesss,\u201d Crowley hissed. \u201cI\u2019ve ssseen your face when I take them off, like you\u2019re--like you\u2019re--\u201d\n\u201cLike I\u2019m what, Crowley?\u201d Aziraphale snapped. \u201cLet there be light,\u201d he said, and a ball of pale white light appeared above them. He propped himself up on one arm, looking into Crowley\u2019s yellow eyes, unwavering. \u201cLike I\u2019m what? How am I looking at you?\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure why he was so...so  angry , he was hardly ever angry, angels weren\u2019t supposed to feel angry unless it was on behalf of Heaven and the Almighty, but it filled him up, in a way it hadn\u2019t in a long time, and he didn\u2019t even know what it was directed at. Not Crowley, exactly, but certainly something Crowley-adjacent. \u201cTell me what I\u2019m thinking, Crowley, because apparently I\u2019m entirely unaware, and I would surely like to know.\u201d\nCrowley blinked at him, as if he wasn\u2019t expecting this reaction. He turned his head so he was looking up at the ceiling instead of at Aziraphale. \u201cYou think they\u2019re--disgusting,\u201d he said, and his voice sounded so  defeated . \u201cEvil.\u201d A small and humorless smile pulled at his lips. \u201cWicked.\u201d\nAziraphale frowned, and all the anger drained out of him. \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said softly. \u201cCrowley\u2026\u201d he trailed off, the words stopping in his throat, as they always did. After a long moment of warring with himself, wondering what he should do, what he should say--if he should do or say anything at all--he finally lifted his hand and, pretending that it wasn\u2019t shaking slightly, cupped Crowley\u2019s cheek, turning his head to face him. His grip was gentle but firm, forcing Crowley to hold his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re wicked. I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d he trailed off again, completely lost. How could Crowley think this? He\u2019d always thought that Crowley just  knew him, could see right through him, how could he have missed the mark this badly?\nCrowley stared at him, unblinking as he often was on the rare occasion he removed his glasses, mouth slightly agape. Aziraphale wasn\u2019t sure how long they were there, silently looking at each other, before Crowley finally said, \u201cI don\u2019t blame you, angel,\u201d and removed his hand so he could look away again. \u201cI don\u2019t like them much either.\u201d\n\u201cCrowley,\u201d Aziraphale said desperately, his hand useless on the bed between them. \u201cI don\u2019t--I  do  like them, how can you--\u201d\n\u201cThey used to be golden, you know,\u201d Crowley said, and it would\u2019ve sounded casual if it wasn\u2019t for how thick his voice was. \u201cBefore...before I fell. All shiny and gold like--well, like gold. All the other angels, they had that metal all over their face, in their hair, their--\u201d he wrinkled his nose, \u201ctheir teeth. Never cared much for that, but the others...I thought it looked nice. Beelzebub, before, her hair was all shiny and golden, and Lucifer, he looked like he was made from it. You know Michael, she\u2019s got it all over her face. I just had my eyes, and I suppose I liked them. Not many of the others had the eyes, you know. I know angels aren\u2019t supposed to care much about what they look like, but they all do, you know that, even Gabriel\u2019s got his bloody tailors.\u201d\nAziraphale nodded, fighting off the familiar impulse to disagree with something that was blasphemous to say but was, technically, true.\n\u201cMy eyes were my favorite part about me, I guess, physically or--or whatever. And then I Fell, and the first thing I saw when I got a look at myself were these big yellow signs reminding me and everyone else that I\u2019m a demon.\u201d His face contorted. \u201cNot only that, but the  Serpent of Eden  , the originator of all sin, as if Eve didn\u2019t  choose to eat the apple. As if I wasn\u2019t just reminding her that she had choices, whatever God told her otherwise.\u201d\nThis was a familiar and well-trod argument between them, but Aziraphale, valiantly, didn\u2019t fall into the familiar groove of it. \u201cThat\u2019s--well.\u201d Aziraphale stopped, and took a deep breath to steady himself, though of course he didn\u2019t need it, and tried to work past the painful weight in his chest, like Crowley had reached through his ribs and pressed his heart too hard between his hands. \u201cWell, if you weren\u2019t the Serpent of Eden, we wouldn\u2019t have met.\u201d\nCrowley snorted, startled. \u201cNo, angel, I suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cBut--well, that\u2019s not the important part, what I mean is--oh,  Crowley ,\u201d he broke off with a sigh, shaking his head. He didn\u2019t know what he meant, or what exactly he was trying to say, even though he started this. \u201cI don\u2019t think your eyes look evil, I think--well, I\u2019ve always thought they were rather beautiful.\u201d\nCrowley blinked, and frowned, and blinked again. He turned his head so he was looking at Aziraphale. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nAziraphale\u2019s face was so hot he was wondering if the Almighty had heard him, and set his head on fire as punishment. \u201cI mean...well, I always thought they were such a pretty and warm color, like daffodils in the spring, and you know how I love daffodils--well, that\u2019s not relevant--but they always just looked like...you.\u201d\n\u201cLike me?\u201d Crowley said. He sounded dazed, as if he\u2019d missed a step taking the stairs, and was trying to regain his footing.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how else to say it,\u201d Aziraphale said, blushing, impossibly, even more. \u201cThey just always looked like  you , and that\u2019s...well, that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\u201cAre you,\u201d Crowley said, and stopped. He licked his lips and tried again, summoning an imitation of his usual wicked smile. \u201cAre you saying you think I\u2019m good looking?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m  saying  , I think your eyes are--\u201d he stopped, sighing. \u201cOh, Crowley, could you just  listen for a moment.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m listening, angel,\u201d he said, his voice gentle again.\n\u201cI just want to see your eyes,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI like seeing them. I miss when you didn\u2019t wear those blasted things all the time and I could see your whole face and what you were feeling and--could you just leave them off, Crowley, please,\u201d he said, and would not admit to anyone, not even God herself, that he was pleading. \u201cWhen it\u2019s just us, or us and the others. Could you just try?\u201d\nCrowley looked at him for a long and agonizing moment, and finally nodded. \u201cSure, Aziraphale,\u201d he said softly. He looked away, and Aziraphale could feel a finality to it. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, my dear,\u201d he murmured, and waved his hand to extinguish the light he\u2019d so dramatically summoned. He heard Crowley turn over--turn  towards him--in the dark, and Aziraphale laid himself down carefully, facing the demon. He could just faintly see Crowley\u2019s yellow eyes in what little light came through the window, pupils blown wide, and he held them, neither of them even pretending to sleep.\nFinally, what felt like an eternity later but probably wasn\u2019t, Aziraphale finally felt the exhaustion of their conversation creep up on him, and his eyes fell closed. He could\u2019ve sworn he felt Crowley\u2019s cool hand take his, the one that lay between them, the one that had cupped his cheek that night, the one that he\u2019d grasped facing the end of the world just a few months ago, but he supposed he could\u2019ve been dreaming.\n\u00a0\nHe woke to find every inch of himself pressed against Crowley again, his arm tingling where Crowley lay on it, his own face shoved into Crowley\u2019s neck--he noted with mild and sleepy horror that he had drooled on him a bit--and his other arm draped over Crowley\u2019s waist. It was an awkward and loose-limbed hug, and though he ought to have been embarrassed to find himself in this position once again, he simply couldn\u2019t bring himself to care. He tightened his grip on Crowley, burrowing his face into the collar of his worn Queen pajama shirt, and fell back to sleep in moments.\nWhen he woke properly, it was to Crowley--wearing his new sweater, Aziraphale noted with a warm feeling in his chest--fixing his hair in the mirror on the inside door of the wardrobe, and he turned to look at Aziraphale, uncertainty in his yellow eyes, unobscured by the sunglasses that still lay on the windowsill, and Aziraphale beamed at him.\n\u201cYou look wonderful, my dear,\u201d he said softly, and Crowley smiled, just a little. \u201cYour hair, I mean.\u201d\nCrowley\u2019s smile widened. \u201cOf course, angel,\u201d he said, turning back to the mirror to continue fussing with it, as it presently resembled a cockatoo. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat afternoon, before Crowley and Aziraphale returned to London, Crowley went to visit with Mr. and Mrs. Young to \u2018persuade\u2019 them to allow Adam to keep the motorbike. Aziraphale disapproved enough that he didn\u2019t want any part of it, but not enough that he was going to stop it.\nInstead, he spent the afternoon drinking tea and chatting about the validity of various unexplained phenomenon with Anathema. He found her company to be quite pleasant, and though he\u2019d tried to refrain from getting too attached to individual humans in his many long years, it seemed he\u2019d made an inadvisable but inevitable exception for this small crop of them.\n\u201cListen,\u201d she said, when they\u2019d reached a comfortable lull in the conversation, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the whole...room thing. Assuming you and Crowley were together, like that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d he said, shifting awkwardly. He supposed it was their short lifespans that gave humans the inexplicable desire to talk things out all the time. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d she began, then stopped. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just what?\u201d He took an uncomfortable sip of his tea.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s just, Agnes said you were,\u201d she said at last. \u201cAnd Agnes has never been wrong, but I guess...well, I guess  I must\u2019ve been wrong. Her prophecy just seemed so clear.\u201d\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Aziraphale tried, but the word came out strangled and wrong. He cleared his throat and tried again. \u201cWhat, exactly, did her prophecy say?\u201d He\u2019d read the whole book cover to cover, and he hadn\u2019t seen anything about him and Crowley being  together .\n\u201c\u2018Hear me, Anathema, and open ye minde, for the Angel and Devil who has\u2019t cometh together in purest union, shall be thy dearest friends and allies,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI was sure, after it all, that\u2019s what it meant.\u201d\nAziraphale remembered the prophecy vaguely, but he\u2019d had no idea what it meant, and it hadn\u2019t seemed important at the time. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, and for some reason, he felt something akin to disappointment. \u201cI suppose the union refers to our Arrangement. Sometimes we...helped each other out, with our work.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Anathema said, though she didn\u2019t sound convinced. \u201cSure.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey returned to London at a comparatively leisurely speed of 80 mph, the quiet of the ride broken up by Queen and occasional conversation about what they ought to do when they got home, both of them insisting that the other\u2019s residence needed renovation.\n\u201cYou run a bookshop, angel, and no one can find any of your books because there hasn\u2019t been any kind of organization since 1810,\u201d Crowley said, exasperated.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Aziraphale sniffed, \u201cI suppose the atmosphere discourages the kind of buyers I\u2019m not particularly interested in.\u201d\n\u201cAll of them, you mean.\u201d Crowley grinned. It was nice to be able to see the way his eyes crinkled when he smiled.\n\u201cNo, the...the  uncommitted ,\u201d Aziraphale said.\n\u201cNo one is as committed to your books as you are,\u201d Crowley said, shaking his head fondly. \u201cYou just don\u2019t want anyone to buy them.\u201d\n\u201cIf they aren\u2019t going to take care of them and love them as well and as much as I have, then I don\u2019t want them buying the books,\u201d Aziraphale insisted. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re one to talk. You know your flat is supposed to be a home, and not some kind of bizarre modern art show.\u201d\n\u201cMy flat is  stylish  ,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cMinimalism is  in , angel, not that you\u2019d know anything about that.\u201d\n\u201cNot everything that\u2019s stylish is good, Crowley, really,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t we just lighten it up a bit? Maybe add some bookshelves?\u201d\nCrowley considered this. \u201cOne bookshelf,\u201d he said at last. \u201cYou can have one.\u201d\n\u201cOh! Crowley, thank you,\u201d he cried. \u201cAnd perhaps some knickknacks to place around, just give it a bit more character--\u201d\n\u201cGive him an inch and he takes a mile,\u201d Crowley muttered. \u201c No knickknacks! \u201d\n\u00a0\nThey had dinner at Aziraphale\u2019s favorite sushi restaurant when they arrived back in London, and by the time they had reached it, Crowley had agreed to three bookshelves, one of which was allowed to have a single shelf of knickknacks and photos, so long as the photos were of people Crowley didn\u2019t loathe, and Aziraphale had agreed to let Crowley devise some method of coherent organization for the bookshop. Aziraphale was certain this was going to come to no good--Crowley had told him he currently had a one star rating on Yelp, and he wasn\u2019t particularly inclined to see it rise. He felt that those truly dedicated to obtaining rare books and first editions wouldn\u2019t be dissuaded from his shop by the online commentary of tourists.\nThough their holiday had been quite enjoyable, returning to the bookshop felt like slipping into a comfortable and well-worn pair of pajamas. \u201cAh, it\u2019s like a breath of fresh air, coming back, isn\u2019t it, Crowley?\u201d he sighed.\n\u201cA breath of musty air and probably some mold spores, more like,\u201d Crowley said mildly, but it seemed he was at least a little glad to be back. \u201cCome on, I think a perfect Riesling just appeared in your wine cabinet.\u201d\nThey savored the wine Crowley had manifested for them, chatting about Adam\u2019s motorbike and a rare new plant Crowley was hoping to pick up from his most trusted seller--though he would rarely admit it, he had strong feelings about plant poaching, and he had brought terrible fates to several individuals who had tried to sell him plants obtained in such a way--and what Aziraphale\u2019s newest knitting project was going to be.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got my eye on this wonderful deep red Angora yarn I saw in a shop the other day,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat would you say to another sweater? I think you look rather dashing in this one,\u201d and Crowley\u2019s expression did something strange.\nIt was late when they retired to the small flat upstairs, and it wasn\u2019t until they reached it that Aziraphale realized, with an absurd sinking feeling, that they were going to be sleeping in separate beds once more.\nHis eyes flickered from his bed to Crowley\u2019s to the man himself, startled to find Crowley watching him, looking oddly vulnerable without his glasses. Aziraphale said very cleverly, \u201cI suppose...well, I suppose.\u201d\nCrowley quirked one brow.\n\u201cShould I--\u201d Aziraphale cast around for something to say. \u201cShould I turn up the heater, then? I...I don\u2019t want you to get cold, tonight. It seemed like I was helping you keep warm, at Anathema\u2019s, I suppose.\u201d\nCrowley looked back at the beds, then at Aziraphale, and raised his hand very slowly. With a flick of his wrist, the beds came together to form one, made of a dark wood with a deep red eiderdown comforter, and what looked to be absurdly soft white sheets. Crowley leaned against one of the bedposts, hands going into his pockets, his eyes never leaving Aziraphale\u2019s.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said, warmth bursting in his chest. He couldn\u2019t quite repress the bright smile that sprang to his lips. \u201cOh, what a beautiful bed. Thank you, my dear.\u201d He busied himself washing their wine glasses from the evening and readying himself for bed, and when he climbed in, Crowley was already there, eyes closed and his breathing deep and even.\nAziraphale smiled at him, snapping to turn the lights out, and hummed contentedly.\n\u201cIs this...alright?\u201d Crowley whispered into the dark of the room, and Aziraphale started, having thought he was asleep.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, but his voice came out too high, and he felt Crowley shift, as if he was going to do something--get up, maybe, or separate their beds once more--and without giving himself a moment to think about it or doubt himself, Aziraphale tucked himself against Crowley\u2019s side, his head resting on the demon\u2019s shoulder. Crowley froze, even his breath stilling, and Aziraphale cautiously raised an arm to wrap it around him. \u201cIs this alright?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his voice coming out in a rush of breath. \u201cYeah. Of course, angel.\u201d He relaxed in small increments, and finally, he put his hand on Aziraphale\u2019s arm where it lay across his stomach. Aziraphale smiled and closed his eyes, falling asleep the way he ought to have been doing it for six thousand years.\n\u00a0\nChristmas Eve was spent seeing a matinee of some awful American action movie full of explosions and guns at Crowley\u2019s insistence, and then, even worse, rearranging Aziraphale\u2019s books.\n\u201cYou said I could, angel,\u201d Crowley reminded him.\n\u201cYes, but I was hoping you\u2019d  forget ,\u201d Aziraphale grumbled.\n\u201cI never forget when I\u2019ve won,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cNow hand me that autographed Keats, I think we should keep the signed ones together in their own section.\u201d\nBy the end of the evening, even Aziraphale had to admit that the place seemed a bit more peaceful and inviting, and he decided he\u2019d just have to switch up the hours a bit more to compensate for it. Crowley\u2019s next target was the flat upstairs, which he insisted looked exactly like the rooms occupied by an impoverished spinster he knew in the late eighteenth century. Aziraphale agreed to new floors--it was possible they were  slightly worn down and creaky, and possibly would have caved in a century ago if it weren\u2019t for the divine miracle that had brought them into existence--and a granite countertop in the kitchen, which he allowed despite Crowley\u2019s promise that it was the first step towards modernizing the kitchen, which he would do if it was his last act on Earth.\nThey went to bed together, as they had been doing for months, and wrapped in each others arms, as they been doing for a few days, and Aziraphale\u2019s heart felt so full that he said, without thinking, \u201cwhat if you moved in here?\u201d\nCrowley stilled, and Aziraphale, perhaps even more shocked than Crowley, did too. \u201cMoved in?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Aziraphale said slowly, and as he thought about it, he began to warm up to the idea. \u201cWe\u2019ve been staying together for a while now, and I thought it would just make a certain sense.\u201d\n\u201cMoved in,\u201d Crowley muttered.\n\u201cYes, moved in,\u201d Aziraphale said defensively. \u201cIs it really so strange of an idea? We\u2019ve practically been living together since Armageddon.\u201d\nCrowley was quiet. \u201cDo you know  why I asked you to stay with me?\u201d\n\n For the same reason we\u2019re sleeping together and you saved me in the church during the Blitz and I\u2019m letting you change my bookshop, which I love more than anything except-- \n\nThat was a dangerous train of thought.\n Because of  this  ,  he wanted to say.  Because of whatever  this  is. But that was a dangerous thought too.\n\u201cBecause,\u201d he said, and Crowley sighed.\n\u201cI was afraid, Aziraphale,\u201d he said, sounding resigned. \u201cI was so, so afraid that you\u2019d go home and I wouldn\u2019t hear from you, and I\u2019d come to find you and your bookshop would be gone and replaced by some, some bible store full of shirts with little fish on them and I\u2019d never see you again.\u201d\n\u201cI think those shops are one of yours, actually,\u201d Aziraphale said faintly. \u201cNot ours.\u201d\n\u201cAziraphale,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI know.\u201d\nThe silence between them felt heavy, and lingered for several long minutes.\n\u201cI was afraid too, you know,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cThat--that Hell would come for you. Or maybe Heaven.\u201d Crowley didn\u2019t say anything. Aziraphale wasn\u2019t even sure he was still awake, and that emboldened him. \u201cI was on Earth, you know, when the second round of angels were thrown out. The...the ones who--were too close with the humans on Earth. The ones who created the Nephilim. I saw what Heaven did to the ones the angels loved. They  destroyed them, and they said--it was just rumor, you know, it\u2019s not what the Almighty said--but some of the others thought She sent the flood to show humanity what would happen to those who--well. Broke those sort of rules. About who they could\u2026\u201d he searched for a word. \u201cFraternize with. And I didn\u2019t--still don\u2019t, I suppose--believe it\u2019s outside the realm of possibility that Heaven would seek to make an example of you too.\u201d\nCrowley said nothing, and Aziraphale was both relieved and, absurdly, disappointed that he must not have heard. But he felt Crowley\u2019s arms tighten around him, perhaps in sleep, or perhaps not.\n\u00a0\nAziraphale woke on Christmas day alone, and felt something sink in his chest until he heard Crowley\u2019s telltale footsteps on the staircase up to the flat.\n\u201cAngel,\u201d he called, and Aziraphale sat up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.\n\u201cIn here, Crowley.\u201d He could hear the sound of mugs clinking in the kitchen, and moments later, Crowley rounded the corner with a steaming cup of tea in one hand and several boxed pastries in the other.\n\u201cI was thinking,\u201d Crowley said, his glasses still on. Aziraphale tapped the side of his own face to remind him, and Crowley scowled at him. He passed Aziraphale the mug and set the pastries down on the bed before removing the glasses, tucking them into an inner pocket of his coat. \u201cI was  thinking ,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe could stay in today.\u201d\n\u201cStay in?\u201d Aziraphale asked, taking a sip of his tea. Things that were miracled never quite tasted exactly right, but Crowley did create the best approximation of his favorite. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, are you wanting to go to church?\u201d Crowley asked, and Aziraphale shrugged.\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking I might perform a few miracles, really get people in the spirit and remind them what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\nCrowley sighed, and finally nodded, clearly thinking it over. \u201cFine. Yes, that\u2019s good, I think, actually. What about the morning? And the evening. Can you do your  miracles in the afternoon?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Aziraphale said suspiciously. Crowley was full of nervous energy, and it was making Aziraphale nervous as well. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, dear boy?\u201d\nCrowley hummed, not quite looking at him. \u201cNothing, really,\u201d he said. \u201cI got you pastries from that bakery you like.\u201d\nAziraphale beamed at him, his suspicion lifting for a moment. \u201cI thought they were closed for Christmas,\u201d he said, reaching for a box containing a strawberry cream cheese danish.\n\u201cIt was the strangest thing,\u201d Crowley said casually. \u201cThe owner just met me at the door, said she had no idea why she was opening, it being the Lord\u2019s birthday and all.\u201d\n\u201cCrowley!\u201d Aziraphale cried, swatting at him. \u201cMrs. Lark is a friend of mine, you know.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone is a friend of yours, angel, it\u2019s part of the job description\u201d Crowley said, and rolled his eyes. \u201cEat up.\u201d\nHe manifested his own cup of tea, and they lay in bed all morning, Aziraphale against the headboard with his knees drawn up to his chest, and Crowley sprawled across the end of the bed, gesturing widely with the single pastry he was working on and getting crumbs everywhere, which Aziraphale waved away with an indulgent sigh every so often.\nWhen the grandfather clock downstairs chimed to let them know it was noon, Aziraphale pursed his lips. He didn\u2019t want to go, really, the bed was comfortable and Crowley\u2019s company even more so, but he supposed he\u2019d have to eventually. The pastries were gone anyway, and if he didn\u2019t get going soon, he\u2019d while the whole holiday away.\n\u201cSuppose I\u2019d best get ready,\u201d Aziraphale said reluctantly.\n\u201cSuppose you\u2019d best,\u201d Crowley said, far too casually. \u201cMiracles to perform and all that.\u201d\nHe narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat are you planning, Crowley?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing, just some Christmas wiles, nothing major,\u201d he assured him. \u201cI\u2019d better get along, priests to tempt and all that.\u201d\n\u201cCrowley--\u201d Aziraphale started, but he was already sauntering out of the flat, and after a few moments, he heard the bell chime and the shop door swing closed.\n\u00a0\nIt was dark when Aziraphale returned to the bookshop, feeling more tired than an angel should. He hoped Crowley meant it when he said he wanted to stay in tonight, he didn\u2019t feel up to doing much more than curling up on the sofa in the backroom and debating the merits of Shakespeare compared to Marlowe.\nHe picked up the phone to try and call his mobile phone, but it went straight to voicemail, and Aziraphale frowned. He didn\u2019t think that had ever happened. Crowley even left it on at the movie theater, making sure to turn the volume all the way up in case he got a call.\n\u201cVery strange,\u201d he murmured into the dim room, and the ceiling above him creaked as if in response. He frowned, unease settling in his stomach.\nHe climbed the stairs to the flat hesitantly. The door was closed, but a light shown under it, as if someone was inside, and a thump from within confirmed his suspicions. No one except Crowley had ever been allowed in his flat, and if Crowley was gone\u2026\nA sick feeling building within him, he creaked the door open with a nervous, \u201chello?\u201d\n\u201cUh,\u201d Crowley\u2019s voice called. \u201cIn here.\u201d\nAziraphale breathed a sigh of relief, and pushed the door open, but it wasn\u2019t his flat that greeted him.\nCrowley had described it once as \u2018a sad antique studio, in the least hip way possible,\u2019 because it was mostly just one room with a kitchen, a dining table, a fireplace, and in a nook hidden from the door, the bed--and, of course, at one point, the bed s .\nNow, however, he was greeted with a quaint and cozy living room. A candle that smelled something like pine and cinnamon was burning on the mantle, which was now wooden and white rather than raw brick, and above which hung a flat screen television. There were several throw blankets folded neatly on the end of an inviting tartan sofa, and one of those soft, furry pillows Aziraphale had considered purchasing on a cream-colored chaise. On the coffee table, which had not existed before he left, was a beautiful orchid; and in fact, now that he noticed, there were a number of houseplants around this new living room, and they looked familiar.\n\u201cCrowley?\u201d Aziraphale said, disbelieving.\n\u201cIn here,\u201d Crowley said again, from the direction of a new door that was open just a crack.\nAziraphale approached it, taking in the sight of a gleaming kitchen around the corner he hadn\u2019t seen from the door, and pushed it open.\nThe room was just small enough to be cozy without feeling at all crowded, and Aziraphale noticed another fireplace, this one lit, but the most important thing, of course, was Crowley, standing at the foot of the bed he\u2019d created several days ago, chewing his lip nervously.\n\u201cWhat...is this, my dear?\u201d Aziraphale asked. He felt as though the air had been snatched from his lungs.\nCrowley opened his mouth, closed it, then opened it again. \u201cI was going to give you a bad quarto of Hamlet I found back in the seventeenth century,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Christmas, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said, as if that was a relevant response to his question. \u201cHow kind of you.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that was quite right, though,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cAfter...after everything. You can still have it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Aziraphale said faintly. Crowley had his glasses on, he noticed, and...and a bouquet of flowers in his hands. \u201cYour glasses, dear.\u201d\nCrowley made a strange sound, halfway between a laugh and a sigh, and took them off. \u201cYou said I should move in.\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d Aziraphale said, feeling both more satisfied and more apprehensive now that they were getting back to what he felt was the most pressing matter at hand, which was that he had left one flat and returned to an entirely different one.\n\u201cI can change it back, if you don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cNo, I do.\u201d And he did. It wasn\u2019t cluttered, but it felt cozy and inhabited; it wasn\u2019t stuck in the past, but it wasn\u2019t horribly modern either. Well, except for that shiny kitchen, but they could discuss that later.\n\u201cI tried to do it so we\u2019d both like it,\u201d Crowley said.\n\u201cI do,\u201d Aziraphale told him. He felt very far away from the conversation, and yet painfully close, like he was standing very near a very large fire. Perhaps it was the fireplace. Yes, that must have been it. \u201cI do like it.\u201d\n\u201cYour flat took a lot of convincing,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cTo do what I wanted it to.\u201d\n\u201cOur flat,\u201d Aziraphale corrected. \u201cIs that...I presume that\u2019s why you changed it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, and met his eyes properly for the first time since he\u2019d walked in. His pupils were wide, and his eyes were desperate. \u201cIs that alright?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Aziraphale said, melting a little. \u201cOf course it is, my dear boy.\u201d Now that some of the shock was wearing off, he felt something like joy soaring in his chest. \u201cHow could it not be?\u201d\nCrowley gave him an uncertain smile, and both their eyes fell to the bouquet in his hands.\n\u201cUh,\u201d he said. \u201cI was going to give you this a while ago.\u201d\nA beat.\n\u201cAbout a century and a half ago, actually,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cBut then we...well, we had that thing in the Park in 1861.\u201d\n\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Aziraphale said faintly. He knew the flowers well; broom, myrtle, and a bright red tulip in the middle.\n\u201cYou liked that flower language nonsense the humans were doing,\u201d Crowley said. Broom, myrtle, a tulip. \u201cYou kept sending me coded bouquets and I had to keep that book you gave me in my pocket so I\u2019d know what the Heaven you were saying.\u201d\nBroom, myrtle, a tulip; a single, bright red tulip.\n\u201cDo you remember when we saw As You Like It?\u201d Crowley asked, and Aziraphale nodded mutely. Surely, Crowley had lost the book; surely, he\u2019d had to pick up another. They weren\u2019t always consistent, these dictionaries of flower languages. \u201cThat part you liked, the one that was in the book too.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Good shepherd, tell this youth what \u2019tis to love, It is to be all made of sighs and tears; It is to be all made of faith and service; It is to be all made of fantasy, All made of passion and all made of wishes, All adoration, duty, and observance, All humbleness, all patience and impatience, All purity, all trial, all observance,\u2019\u201d Aziraphale murmured. \u201cMore or less.\u201d\nCrowley smiled. \u201cDo you,\u201d he stopped, shifted his weight. \u201cDo you remember it? All that stuff from the book?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know what these are?\u201d\n\u201cBroom, and myrtle,\u201d he said, and swallowed hard. \u201cA tulip.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what it means,\u201d Crowley said.\n\"Humility, and love, and,\" he stopped, eyes flickering up at Crowley and back to the bouquet. \"And a declaration of love.\"\n\"Yup,\" Crowley said, drawing the word out. Aziraphale felt frozen in place. He wanted to move, or say something, but he didn't know what, didn't know how. \"Not to rush you, or anything, but,\" he said, after several long beats of silence, \"you're kind of leaving me hanging here, angel.\"\n\"Oh, Crowley,\" he murmured, and a dam in him broke. His eyes filled with tears, though for what, he wasn't sure. \"Oh, my dear, dear boy, are you sure?\"\n\"Am I. Am I  sure?  \" Crowley said incredulously. \"Aziraphale, I've been sure for six thousand bloody years, I don't think it's  my feelings that need to be said, here.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Aziraphale asked, his eyes meeting Crowley's. He frowned.\n\"Don't play stupid, angel,\" he said. \"I've been in love with you since I met you on the wall of that bloody garden.\"\n\"You've  what? \" Aziraphale's voice came out oddly pitched, and Crowley squinted at him.\n\"Are you trying to tell me,\" he said, \"that all this time, you didn't know?\"\n\"No, I didn't  know  , why would I  know  , don't you think I would have  said something? \u201d Aziraphale demanded, gaping at Crowley.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Crowley said, and Aziraphale had to admit that was a fair assumption. \u201cI thought you were, I don\u2019t know, being considerate of my feelings.\u201d\n\u201cCrowley,\u201d Aziraphale said, and took a shaky and uncertain step towards him.\nCrowley watched him carefully, holding the bouquet so tightly that his knuckles were white, and it was probably through the sheer force of his will that the stems weren\u2019t breaking.\nAziraphale reached out, and took the bouquet in his shaking hands. \u201cCrowley,\u201d he said again, and put one hand on the demon\u2019s cheek.\n\u201cAziraphale,  please  ,\u201d Crowley begged, his voice rough, \u201cI know I go too fast for you, but it\u2019s been six thousand years, angel,  please --\u201d\nAziraphale kissed him.\nFor a moment, Crowley did nothing, shock freezing him in place, which was slightly inconvenient because Aziraphale had never actually done this before, and slightly awkward, too, because something deep in the pit of his stomach was telling him that he was somehow misinterpreting all this and Crowley was going to push him away and ask him what the Heaven all of  that was.\nBut after a moment, Crowley made a desperate noise low in his throat and wrapped his arms around Aziraphale and pulled him so close, the bouquet was crushed between them, and Aziraphale let it go without thought, sliding his hand into Crowley\u2019s hair and fisting the other in his sweater.\n\u201cAngel,\u201d Crowley whispered against him. \u201cAngel, angel, angel.\u201d\nAziraphale nipped his lower lip to quiet him, but of course, Crowley only made  more noise, a low keen that made Aziraphale feel like he was going to come apart, and Aziraphale pulled back, breathing like he\u2019d just run a marathon and, like poor Pheidippides, was going to collapse dead at any moment. \u201cCrowley,\u201d he said, \u201care you sure?\u201d\n\u201cIf you ask me if I\u2019m sure one more time, I\u2019m taking my interior decor and I\u2019m  leaving  ,\u201d Crowley growled. \u201cPlease, angel, would you just believe me? Would I lie to you--about  this ,\u201d he clarified, before Aziraphale could make the usual point that he was, of course, a demon.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cNo, I suppose you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d and he kissed him again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Aziraphale said, some years later. He sat at their dining table, the morning paper open in front of him as he ate his pastry. Crowley was leaning dangerously far back in his chair, tapping insistently at his mobile. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you always?\u201d Crowley asked.\n\u201cYes, dear, I rather think that\u2019s the point of consciousness,\u201d Aziraphale said, rolling his eyes. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve been thinking about something  important .\u201d\n\u201cIs this about all those cottages you keep looking up on my phone?\u201d Crowley asked, quirking one brow. Aziraphale gaped at him, and Crowley laughed. \u201cYou know the web page doesn\u2019t close when you leave the app, right?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Aziraphale said, blushing. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cSo is this about that?\u201d Crowley asked, and put all four of the chair\u2019s legs on the floor, much to Aziraphale\u2019s relief. He leaned forward.\n\u201cI...yes, it is,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s just that--well, the city is getting a bit loud,\u201d he said, \u201cand busy, and crowded, and Anathema told me lovely things about the cottages in the South Downs.\u201d\n\u201cI liked the one with the big space for a flower garden,\u201d Crowley said, beginning to smile. \u201cAnd room for Dog to play, when Adam comes to visit.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Aziraphale said, returning it. He reached out and took Crowley\u2019s hand in his, turning it over to link their fingers together. \u201cI quite liked that one too.\u201d"
