Sorry I haven't had time to respond to them, but I figured you'd all rather me work on the chapter.<br>Sorry for the lateness of this one.

I'm struggling with a lot of uni work.<br>I had a whole conversation between Ben and Diego about Diego realizing why Klaus never blamed his siblings for being so harsh to him, but then I ended up deleting it all because it just didn't fit. It was a painful experience! Lol.<br>Anyway here it is. I hope everyone likes it.<br>I must apologize for having to add a bit of Luther/ Allison.<br>I hate writing slash and I don't like their incestuous relationship. However, I thought it was necessary just because I realized I made Allison sound a bit like a bitch in the last chapter and I wanted her to explain herself.<br>Also I wanted to explain a bit more of Luther's side too.<br>Almost done with the fic!!!<br>I added an extra chapter because I realized in my planning that chapter 6 and 7 were actually supposed to be one chapter and I split them up accidentally. So it's ten chapters not nine now.</p>\n<p>Sorry for not replying to many comments!

He\u2019d done it with Ben, he knew that, but now that Ben was alive again there was no one he could reach for. He could never hope to replicate what they\u2019d done in the theater, especially under the cold and clinical eye of Reginald Hargreeves.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His guardian hadn\u2019t said a word. He\u2019d just crossed the room in two long strides, snatched Klaus\u2019 wrist, and yanked him out the door so hard he felt his shoulder joint scream under the strain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDad-\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou need to get over this pathetic fear, Number Four,\u201d Hargreeves snarled. \u201cYou\u2019re such a disappointment.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That was when the cold wave of dread swept over him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He knew what those words meant. What horrors usually followed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Klaus was dragged out the house. Despite his struggled, Hargreeves kept his grip tight enough to bruise, and he was no match for a skinny thirteen-year-old.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He\u2019d never regretted getting clean so much before.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because he was beginning to remember this trip.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The last time he\u2019d been thirteen (and wasn\u2019t that a trippy thought) and his dad had lost his temper with him, he\u2019d been locked in the mausoleum for two days. It\u2019d been the first time he\u2019d been stuck in there while high. It\u2019d been dark and stunk to high heaven. He\u2019d shivered his way through the first night and stopped feeling his fingers during the second. But he\u2019d seen nothing. It\u2019d been quiet.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This time he didn\u2019t have the luxury of a high to help him through it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Klaus started struggling more. This was ridiculous. He was a thirty-year-old man! Kind of. And he\u2019d sworn to himself! He\u2019s sworn to never step foot in that place again.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ben had promised him that he wouldn\u2019t have to.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The mausoleum came into view and Klaus started screaming. He wasn\u2019t sure exactly what he was saying, but words and names were exploding from his mouth and panic seared through his veins because he was fucking not going back there.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hargreeves only grunted with annoyance and dragged Klaus through the mud and down the stone steps. His knees scraped against the rock as his limbs grew weak and the fight left him under the dark shadows of the crypt.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without another word Klaus was thrown to the dead and the door was shut behind him.\nIt was the smell that got to him first. Dead, rotting bodies don\u2019t smell good no matter how long they\u2019d been shut up in a windowless crypt for. The stench doubled him over and he was left gagging against the dirt floor.\nThe mausoleum was cold. Bone chillingly cold. The type of cold that sinks into a soul and doesn\u2019t let go. He\u2019d had nightmares about that type of cold long after leaving the mansion. He\u2019d wake up shaking, jaw clenched shut, a scream raw in his throat. No matter how many blankets he\u2019d wrap around his shivering body he could never warm up.\nIt was smaller than he remembered. The claustrophobia of it has always stuck with him. But in his mind, the mausoleum stretched into the darkness. It consisted of a tight corner of stone and the rest was just voices and gore and horror. Now though\u2026 \u00a0he didn\u2019t have enough room to even stretch out his arms. The crypt was nothing but a box. Or a cage.\nHe\u2019s wasn\u2019t supposed to be in here. He\u2019d sworn he\u2019d never go back.\n\nKlaus.\n\nThe whisper was enough to send a fresh wave of panic burning through his insides.\n\nKlaus. Klaus.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t breathe. There wasn\u2019t enough air. His lungs burned.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve been waiting for you.\n\n\n\u201cPlease, please, let me out.\u201d The whisper sounded pathetic even to his ears; it was nothing but a high-pitched whine scratching at the walls. He couldn\u2019t do this. He was nothing. He was useless.\n\n\nKlaus. Please. Please. Klaus.\n\n\nThey were so loud.\nThere was a flicker of a face suddenly too close. A woman hovered in front of him. Bloody chunks of flesh had been ripped from her cheek. Her eye was half clawed out. Flaps of skin peeled from her bone like paper. He flinched backwards, back slamming hard against the wall. His head hit the stone with a terrifying thunk.\nFor a moment his head swam, and a thousand corpses rose around him.\n\n\nKlausKlausKlaus.\n\n\nA man with brains spilling across over the shards of his leftover skull.\n\n\nPleasehelpuspleasehelpuspleasehe-\n\n\nAnother clawing at his own face. Another gagging on his own organs slipping from his mouth. Another screamed. Another begged. Another another another\u2026\nHis chest heaved, lungs burned. There was no air. His nails ripped into his skin. He had to feel something, had to stay grounded. Had to find an anchor.\nHe wasn\u2019t a child any more. He could do this.\nA torso dragged itself across the floor by its elbows. Intestines spilled from where the rest of it\u2019s body had been hacked off. Cold fingers scraped against his shin.\nWait-\n\n\nKlausklausklausklausklaus-\n\n\nHis hands were glowing.\nHis hands were glowing and the nails clawing at his calf left painful red lines. Bony fingers closed around his throat. He could feel cold breath against his face. A heavy weight against his chest.\nThey were real. They were real. They were real.\n\n-klausklaushelpklauswemissedyouklausklausklaus-\n\n\u201cPlease. Please. Someone. Let me out!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey were trying to have a meeting. Key word \u201ctrying.\u201d Luther had been talking without a break for ten straight minutes now, and Ben was pretty sure the only people actually listening were Allison and Vanya.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Five was furiously scribbling equations in his notebook and muttering to himself every few seconds. He hadn\u2019t looked up once or acknowledged any of them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diego sat beside Ben, and he could clearly see the knife he was sharpening under the table. He knew from experience that the world could be ending, and Diego would never listen to a word Luther said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To his credit, Ben was trying to pay attention. He\u2019d caught a few words such as, \u201cNeed to find Howard,\u201d and \u201cVanya\u2019s pills,\u201d and \u201ctraining.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t help his gaze floating to the door. Because Klaus was supposed to have been there over fifteen minutes ago.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ben still didn\u2019t like leaving Klaus\u2019 side. They hadn\u2019t been separated for years. During the first couple weeks of being back in their childhood home they\u2019d even shared a bed, until Pogo had become too suspicious. If Ben could have it his way, Klaus would never leave his sight. The idea of not having him around made him feel queasy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They\u2019d spent over ten years with only each other. That couldn\u2019t be forgotten in less than a month.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now they had less than two minutes before dinner was called and his brother was still nowhere to be seen.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ben looked back to Luther, \u201cHas anyone seen Klaus?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cKlaus?\u201d Their leader (sort of) blinked at him, shocked he\u2019d been interrupted mid-strategizing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe was training with Dad,\u201d Vanya offered, eyes not lifting from the floor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Ben, \u201cbut he should\u2019ve been finished over an hour ago.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His siblings looked confused. They clearly hadn\u2019t given Klaus\u2019 disappearance as much thought as he had.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They clearly hadn\u2019t given it any thought at all.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A bell clanged from downstairs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The others rose, their movements robotic as they clambered out of small backroom they\u2019d been huddled in. Ben followed them automatically.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They gathered around the table, each taking their place, as they\u2019d done thousands of times before. Before the apocalypse. Before their Dad\u2019s death. Before Ben\u2019s death\u2026\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even as their father appeared and motioned for them all to sit, Klaus\u2019 place remained empty. There was no meal prepared for him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere\u2019s Klaus?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hargreeves grunted through a mouthful of potato, \u201cNo talking at the table.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His siblings eyed him silently. They were willing him to stay quiet. To not aggravate their father. It was the same exact thing they\u2019d done to Number Five before he had disappeared.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere is Klaus?\u201d Ben asked again. He didn\u2019t think he needed to though. He had a pretty good idea on where Hargreeves had put him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His dad sighed and put his fork down delicately next to his plate. His movements were deliberate, and his words hard and angry. \u201cExtra training. He needed it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou put him in the mausoleum, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This, at least, prompted an ounce of emotion to flicker across Hargreeves\u2019 face. He hadn\u2019t been expecting that. He didn\u2019t know that Ben knew. Ben shouldn\u2019t know. Klaus had never told him until Ben had shared his head. Until he\u2019d witnessed the breakdowns and the nightmares and the flashbacks\u2026\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t going to let that happen again.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ben leapt from his chair, sending it flying to the floor. The rest of his siblings jumped. Diego opened his mouth, maybe to stop him, maybe to help him, but Ben was already halfway to the door at a dead run.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pogo stopped him in his tracks.\nAt this age they were practically the same height, but still Ben got the impression of Pogo being very small in front of him. His eyes were sorrowful, sad. He regretted what he had to do. \u201cPlease, the master insists that-\u201d\nBut regrets didn\u2019t save them last time.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let him do this, Pogo,\u201d Ben whispered.\nPogo bowed his form as a shadow fell over them. Hargreeves stood beside them, a scowl deeply cut into his face and white-hot anger blazing in his eyes.\n\u201cThis behaviour is unacceptable, Number Six. You will go to your room this instant, and you will not come out until I deem it necessary. Do you understand?\u201d\nThe ferocity of the words knocked him back a couple steps and a sudden rush of fear gripped his heart. He\u2019d never been scared of Hargreeves before. He was a cold and clinical monster and an abusive asshole, but even up until his death Ben had never felt like he was truly in danger. Not directly. He was afraid of missions and of his powers and of his training. But Hargreeves had never directly hurt him out of anger or spite.\nWhen Klaus had spoken of Hargreeves\u2019 temper or the fear he\u2019d felt growing up in their house, Ben had never truly understood. Not until this moment.\nThen Luther\u2019s hand clamped down on his shoulder and the spell was broken.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take him upstairs, Dad,\u201d Number One said as he ushered Ben away. Ben felt enough power under his brother\u2019s hands to know this wasn\u2019t optional. He allowed himself to be guided away, leaving the rest of their family staring after them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs soon as they were out of sight, Ben wrenched himself away.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave him, Luther!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBen-\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, listen to me. When you had your breakdown who followed you into that rave? He would die for you Luther! Literally die. And I told him you\u2019d do the same thing for him, and now you can\u2019t even-\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBen, listen to me,\u201d Luther whispered, \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving him. But we can\u2019t go get him now. We\u2019ll wait until everyone\u2019s gone to bed, okay?\u00a0 We can\u2019t risk getting caught without a-\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPlan? Forget your plans!\u201d Ben screamed. It was five o\u2019clock. Hargreeves wouldn\u2019t retire to bed until past midnight. He couldn\u2019t abandon Klaus for over seven hours! \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a month here waiting for you to come up with a plan. You know what\u2019s happened? Vanya\u2019s still barely talks to us. Diego still does his loner thing. Five\u2019s always off on his own. And now Klaus is locked in a mausoleum without us.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ben stared at Luther, breathless. His brother looked stunned. This was the most he\u2019d spoken\u2026 ever. Even before his death he\u2019d always preferred his nose stuck in a book than to engage in the drama the others were always absorbed in.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Look where that got him\u2026 look where that got all of them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNone of you understand\u2026 we have to rescue Klaus.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Luther seemed to pause, taking his words in. \u201cWe will,\u201d he said finally, placing his hands-on Ben\u2019s shoulders, \u201cBut we have to wait until Dad can\u2019t catch us. Or he\u2019ll catch on to everything.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was past one a.m. when Luther and Ben snuck their way out of the mansion. The rest of their siblings were on lookout duty, hidden away through the mansion in case Hargreeves woke up and found them gone. He hadn\u2019t left his office until after midnight, probably expecting Ben to do something much like he was doing now. What Hargeeves wouldn\u2019t expect was the siblings working together. Especially Luther.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diego had thrown a fit when Five had told them the plan. But Luther was the only one who could open the mausoleum door. Ben wasn\u2019t particularly thrilled on bringing Luther along either. The last time Luther and Klaus had spent quality time together hadn\u2019t been a particularly fun evening for anyone involved. But he had to admit, Luther did seem pretty worried. The idea of their father going so far for \u201ctraining\u201d had seemed to rattle him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t even know we had something like a mausoleum outside our house,\u201d Luther admitted as they did their best to sneak out of sight across the grass.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ben shrugged, \u201cKlaus showed it to me once when we were younger. It was awful. He wouldn\u2019t go near it, but I went inside, and I had nightmares for about a week. He never told me about Dad locking him inside though. Not until\u2026\u201d He trailed off, sure Luther could finish the rest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI still don\u2019t understand though. Why would Dad do this?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell\u2026 Dad claimed that it was for Klaus to get over his fear.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Luther stopped mid-step and Ben almost collided with him. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that\u2019s the reason?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHonestly? No. You don\u2019t lock a nine-year-old in a crypt expecting him not to be afraid afterwards.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo why then?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPunishment? Pettiness?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Luther blinked at him through the darkness, seeming unable to comprehend what Ben was saying. \u201cWhat? You think Dad just did this\u2026 to be\u2026mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ben rolled his eyes. \u201cIf you want to simplify it then yeah. I think Dad wanted to punish Klaus for not taking the Umbrella Academy seriously enough or not listening to him or for just being annoying. And it worked. Come on, let\u2019s go before we\u2019re caught. We\u2019ve been out here too long already.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ben kept walking, not checking behind him to see if Luther was following.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Luther was still so loyal. Even after the what had happened with Vanya and the whole moon thing. It was like going back in time had erased everything for him.\nBut it hadn\u2019t erased everything for Ben. He could still remember what it felt like to be torn to pieces by what was inside of him. He could still remember Hargreeves watching, notebook in hand, and doing nothing. He remembered Klaus screaming through the night from nightmares when the alcohol wasn\u2019t enough to knock him out.\nLuther might believe that their dad deserved another chance, but Ben was through with second chances.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen they reached the mausoleum, it was worse than Ben remembered. Narrow stone steps sloped into the darkness, ending with a wedge of stone stuck in the dirt. No wonder they\u2019d all never noticed it before. It was muddy and slimy, and just imagining what was behind that door was sending shivers up Ben\u2019s spine.\n\u201cIt literally looks like the gate to hell,\u201d Luther whispered, his eyebrows knitting together. To his credit, there was no hesitation in his step as he approached the door and took it with both hands. \u201cReady?\u201d\nBen nodded and Luther opened the door.\nAt first, he couldn\u2019t see anything but darkness. Even with the moonlight flooding in, he couldn\u2019t make out any movement between the graves and stone.\n\u201cKlaus?\u201d Ben called in a hoarse whisper, forcing himself down the steps and through the entrance way. Luther hovered behind him, obviously reluctant to enter. There was nothing though. Cobwebs and graves and stone. The stench was enough to take his eyes water and the cold took his breath away. But there was no Klaus.\nThen Ben saw him.\nKlaus was prone on the floor, lying on his side, half hidden in the shadows. His eyes were vacant, staring at nothing. His breathing was coming out in shallow pants as if he couldn\u2019t find any air. There was blood too. So much blood.\nBen ran to him, his building fear of the dark suddenly lost to his panic.\n\u201cKlaus?\u201d he called again. He put his hand to Klaus\u2019 cheek, trying to rouse him. His skin was like ice. \u201cC\u2019mon, we\u2019re getting you out. Can you hear me?\u201d\nKlaus remained on the ground, unblinking, unresponsive.\nLuther came up behind them and knelt. Ben could see his hands were shaking when he pressed his fingers lightly against Klaus\u2019 pulse. \u201cHis heart\u2019s beating way too fast. It\u2019s like he\u2019s in shock or something.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026 Okay\u2026 Let\u2019s just\u2026 get him out of here.\u201d\nLuther nodded and took Klaus in his arms, easily lifting him off the freezing ground. Ben could feel the bite of frost between his jeans just from the short time he\u2019d been kneeling. He couldn\u2019t imagine how cold Klaus was.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the grass under the moonlight, Ben could see Klaus better. He was shivering violently, almost seizing, and his breathing was still coming out ragged and short. His skin was so white he looked almost corpse-like. There was no life in his eyes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And the blood\u2026 there was a lot of blood. He was covered in what looked like claw marks and bruises and\u2026 were those bite marks?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ben could only shake his head. \u201cWe need to get him back home. Now.\u201d\nThey almost made it up the stairs. Luther\u2019s foot was on the first step, Klaus safe in his arms, and Ben just behind them. Klaus hadn\u2019t changed since Luther had picked him up off the floor of the mausoleum. He was still shivering, eyes roaming wildly, but seeing nothing in front of him. Ben\u2019s stomach lurched at the sight of the blood and the sickly grey of his skin. He didn\u2019t know to fix this.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho is out of bed?\u201d Hargreeves\u2019s voice called through the hall. Ben and Luther froze, deer caught in headlights.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLuther, keep going,\u201d Ben hissed loud as he dared.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut he knows-\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGo. I\u2019ll handle it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Luther hesitated and Ben could see his hero complex roaring in his eyes. But then he looked down at Klaus in his arms and nodded stiffly. With one last look, he disappeared up the stairs and Ben turned to face their dad.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It didn\u2019t take long for the man to turn the corner. A scowl twisted his face into a grimace, and despite the pajamas, he still had his monocle jammed in his eye.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNumber Six. Report. What are you doing out of bed?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ben said nothing. He could feel himself gagging on the words but all he could feel was Hargreeves rage from dinner.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf this is about Number Four,\u201d Hargreeves continued, \u201cthen we need to have words. Follow.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His dad turned on his heel and disappeared down the hallway. Ben had no choice but to follow him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When they reached the office, Hargreeves took his seat behind his desk, leaving Ben hovering at the doorway, unsure if he was supposed to follow or not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell?\u201d Hargreeves said, \u201cEnter.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Been took a single step inside the room.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI assume Number Four told you of his extra training. You will not interfere any more, is that clear? He needs to control his fear, or he will be of no use to me. To anybody.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d Ben said, unable to stop himself... Why did he say that? Why did he say that? He shouldn\u2019t have spoken. He should have just let Hargreeves rage at him until he settled on a punishment and sent him on his way. He needed to get back to Klaus, not stand here to be screamed at like a child.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hargreeves slammed his palms on the desk so hard the wood groaned in protest. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re not helping him.\u201d Ben hated how young he sounded. He hated that he was thirteen. Because even though he was solid and alive again, Klaus was still getting hurt. They weren\u2019t changing anything.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you not trust me, Number Six?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ben didn\u2019t know how to answer that. He thought of Klaus screaming, tied up in a motel cupboard. He thought of Vanya looking so lost and alone. He thought of Luther on the moon for four years. He thought of Allison and Diego unable to keep their lives on track no matter how hard they tried. He thought of Five, forty-five years lost and alone.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He remembered his insides tearing his apart as his guardian watched, his expression neutral even as Ben was choking on his own blood. Hargreeves had shown more emotion during dinner than he had watching his son die.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Ben didn\u2019t answer, Hargreeves nodded, as if taking his silence as an apology.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou will return to bed. And Number Four will be kept for another five hours.\u201d Ben opened his mouth to argue, but Hargreeves glared. \u201cIf I catch you again, it\u2019ll be another twelve.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiego had seen Klaus so high he hadn\u2019t remembered his own name. He\u2019d seen him sobbing like a baby at a picture on a wall. He\u2019d seen him tired to a chair and screaming for drugs. This was worse. This was 1000x worse.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Luther hadn\u2019t said a word when he\u2019d walked in. He\u2019d just put Klaus on the bed and taken a step back, clearly ready to hand the responsibility to someone else. Five had asked about Ben, but Diego hadn\u2019t paid attention to the answer because Klaus looked so bad. His eyes were crazed, flickering around the room, never settling, not seeing anything. He probably didn\u2019t even know where he was. His breath was coming out in short, desperate pants where the air wasn\u2019t getting in. And the blood. There was so much blood. His uniform was ripped to pieces and Diego could see the cuts and claw marks underneath.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Allison peering at their brother, taking a step closer. No one touched him though. \u201cI thought he was just locked up? He looks\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEnough, if you\u2019re not going to help then leave the room,\u201d Diego said, finally, surprising even himself. He took a step forward, placing his hand gently on Klaus\u2019s shoulder. The boy whimpered, the first sign of awareness. \u201cKlaus, can you hear me?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His lips started moving, barely, and Diego had to lean down to hear the whisper of, \u201cThey\u2019re real. They\u2019re real. They\u2019rereal. They\u2019rerealthey\u2019rerealthey\u2019rereal.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey, hey, Klaus, it\u2019s me. We\u2019re here. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diego could hear the air catching in Klaus\u2019s throat, the labored pants becoming quick frantic gasps. Then his eyes were focusing, catching on Diego\u2019s face and holding, widening, filling with panic.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Klaus,\u201d Diego crooned as gently as he could manage with his pitchy thirteen-year-old voice. \u201cI\u2019m here. You\u2019re not\u2026 not locked up, anymore. You\u2019re safe.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If Klaus heard him, he made no show of it. Instead he only seemed to get worse. His breathing broke down into desperate gasps, air clearly not getting through.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re\u2026real\u2026 Diego\u2026 they\u2019re real.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cKlaus, listen, breathe.\u201d Panic welled in Diego\u2019s chest. He didn\u2019t know what to do! He couldn\u2019t help him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then Ben was there. He hadn\u2019t heard him come in, but he was there, on the bed, leaning over Klaus with a look of calm Diego knew he would never mirror.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBreathe with me,\u201d Ben said. He took Klaus\u2019s hand and put it to his own chest. Diego watched them breath together. Ben, slow and steady, Klaus desperate and broken. Tears ran down Klaus\u2019s face, but Ben\u2019s gaze never wavered, and his voice was sturdy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, when Klaus\u2019s airways seemed to clear, Ben gathered his brother in his arms. Klaus curled up in his lap, fingers knotted in his pajama shirt, sobbing violently. Diego had to look away. He felt like he was intruding on something his shouldn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He quietly slipped away to join the others in the hallway.\nFive could sense the argument brewing. His family had never been good with dealing with their emotions. Luther was pacing the hallway, making no attempt at staying quiet. Five was almost tempted to throw something at him just to get him to stop, but he knew that\u2019d be the straw to break the camel\u2019s back.\nAllison wasn\u2019t much better. She was glaring at the wall, her hands in tight fists at her side.\nVanya looked the worst though. She was shaking, practically vibrating, arms wrapped around herself. Her eyes were far away and glazed over with tears that were yet to fall. Five could see the memories of her own prison rushing through her mind. He knew he should comfort her. He used to be able to do such things. Comforting Vanya had been the easiest thing in the world when they were twelve and the worst thing to happen was their father passing over her for their portraits.\nSimpler times.\nThe door to Luther\u2019s room popped open and Diego slipped out. Five could tell instantly that he was looking to pick a fight, because that was just what Diego did. Under any other circumstances, he\u2019d let them have at it (them usually being Luther and Diego). He was usually willing to wait for them to tire themselves out before they could calm down enough to listen to actual logic.\nHowever, fighting amongst themselves wasn\u2019t something they could afford at the moment.\n\u201cNot a word,\u201d Five ordered before Diego could so much as blink. \u201cBefore we sort through this mess, Klaus needs to be taken care of. Has he calmed down at all?\u201d\nDiego opened his mouth, but Five glared hard until he closed it and nodded slowly.\nHe let out a breath he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d been holding. He didn\u2019t know much about comforting his siblings, but he could deal with the rest. The rest was logic and order. \u201cHe\u2019ll need clothes. And medical attention. I\u2019m going to get some things. The rest of you can stay in my room until I come get you. Not a word to each other. If I so much as hear a whisper, I\u2019m teleporting you to the roof and leaving you there. Understand? Hargreeves might still be awake.\u201d\nSurprisingly, they all nodded.\nFive let himself teleport away, focusing on the mental to-do list he\u2019d set for himself. If he just followed the steps, he didn\u2019t have to think about Klaus. Just gather the pajamas and don\u2019t think about his brother hyperventilating out of fear. Find the first aid kid and don\u2019t think about the cuts and blood.\nThat line of thinking stopped as soon as Five teleported back to Luther\u2019s room.\nBen was still there and the boys were curled into each other. Klaus wasn\u2019t catatonic anymore, which was a relief. But he was shaking and whimpering, buried into Ben\u2019s chest like a child.\nFive supposed they were children, sort of. And that was his fault. His fault they were in this mess. His fault because he couldn\u2019t stop the apocalypse the first time around. So now his siblings were reliving their trauma.\nHe\u2019d known Vanya had had it bad. He\u2019d read her book and he\u2019d always pitied her as a child. But he\u2019d never considered the others. He\u2019d spent decades wondering about what could have happened after he\u2019d left, but he\u2019d never considered that there had been things going on in the house he hadn\u2019t noticed before he left.\nHe couldn\u2019t think about it, though. This was a time for logic. This was a time for action. He could do those things.\n\u201cBen,\u201d Five said softly. His brother almost jumped out of his skin, clearly too focused on Klaus to have noticed his appearance. Klaus made no sign that he\u2019d heard however, which sent a sinking feeling into Five\u2019s stomach. \u201cI need to check his wounds. Will you hold him? Keep him calm?\u201d\nBen nodded. Klaus was tucked under his chin, limbs folded away, and eyes scrunched closed.\nHe approached slowly, cautious about scaring Klaus too badly. He didn\u2019t know what mind-state his brother was in, and his wounds had to be at least cleaned up before he could be left.\nBen moved Klaus gently, so that they could both see the extent of the damage. Klaus didn\u2019t react other than opening his eyes. The swoop of worry hit Five again, but he forced himself to ignore it. Just go through the checklist, he told himself firmly.\nHe took the wash cloth he\u2019d grabbed first, but when he went to clean the blood away from Klaus, the boy flinched away, whimpering into Ben\u2019s arms. His eyes were glazed over, seeing something very far away. Before Five could say anything, Ben gently took the cloth out of his hands.\nFive watched Ben take over, willing to sit back for the moment.\nHe ran the cloth over Klaus\u2019s cuts and bruises gently, talking to him in a voice so soft and quiet that Five couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying even from his position beside them. Klaus didn\u2019t whimper again, but he didn\u2019t relax either, and his eyes remained glassy and unresponsive. Five couldn\u2019t help but stare, the worry and fear coming back ten-fold.\nHe really hadn\u2019t protected them. He was double their age, and not only had he not protected them, he\u2019d made this happen. He\u2019d had no idea the decision he\u2019d forced Klaus into making back in the theater.\n\u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d Ben asked in a whisper and it took a moment for Five to realize the question was directed at him.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s so hurt\u2026 the ghosts have never hurt him before. I couldn\u2019t even touch him!\u201d\n\u201cBut you could near the end, right? Before we traveled back?\u201d Five asked, thankful for the logic taking over as his brain searched for an answer. He could focus on questions, focus on answers. \u201cMaybe it was a fear reaction, like in the theater. He didn\u2019t mean to make you corporeal, but his instinct took over. Like a fight or flight thing. He was scared, so his powers took over to protect him. Similar situation, except this time it looks like it did more harm than help.\u201d\n\u201cMore harm? Look at him!\u201d Ben was staring at him in disbelief.\n\u201cI know. It\u2019s quite interesting, actually. I wonder if-\u201d\n\u201cStop! You sound just like Dad,\u201d Ben snapped, his voice suddenly loud against the silence of Luther\u2019s bedroom. Klaus whimpered, eyes darting around the room wildly in search of the threat. Ben ran his hands through Klaus\u2019s curls, trying to sooth him, whispering an apology.\nFive took a breath. He hadn\u2019t meant it that way. He didn\u2019t want to be clinical and removed like Hargreeves had been during their training. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered, as much to Klaus as to Ben, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. I do care about him.\u201d\nBen only nodded and tossed the washcloth to the floor. It was soaked in blood. Now that Five could see Klaus from under the blood, he looked grey, like a corpse. His curls were stuck to his forehead with sweat. A few of the cuts were still bleeding.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to need a few stitches,\u201d Five decided, glancing at Ben. \u201cDo you think you can keep him calm while I do it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026 yeah, just be quick.\u201d\nThere was no need to worry though. Five worked efficiently, trying to keep it as painless as possible. Theoretically he could have teleported to the medical room and found some anesthetic, but he didn\u2019t know enough about it to trust himself, and he wasn\u2019t ready to risk any unknowns with Klaus in the state he was in. Klaus didn\u2019t seem to even notice what Five was doing though. His eyes remained glazed over and occasionally he\u2019d flinch, but Five didn\u2019t know if that was because of the pain or a memory or just because of Five\u2019s presence suddenly too close for comfort.\nHis injuries were extensive. The more Ben and Five looked, the worse it got. He had claw marks up and down his legs, all sluggishly bleeding into the bed-covers. He had dark bruises in the shape of fingers. He had chunks ripped out as if by fingernails. He even had bite-marks so deep they were still bloody.\nFive was at a loss. \u201cI know the dead did this to him, but\u2026 it\u2019s hard to believe\u2026 I mean, they\u2019re like you right? They\u2019re people.\u201d\n\u201cNot all,\u201d Ben whispered. He wasn\u2019t looking at Five, but on Klaus. \u201cI held onto my humanity. Because of Klaus. He made me feel real\u2026 human\u2026 but sometimes it was hard. It\u2019s like\u2026 I don\u2019t know, like a pressure on your head all the time. Like a tidal wave, threatening to wash you away. And I knew if I let it, I wouldn\u2019t be me anymore. That\u2019s what happens when the dead hold on for too long to the real world. They just get washed away. And then these things take over. Just brainless monsters. Animals.\u201d\nBen took a deep, shaky breath. His hands carded through Klaus\u2019s hair rhythmically, as if he had to remind himself that he could do that. He could feel again. Someone else Five had let down when he\u2019d disappeared. He hadn\u2019t been there when Ben had died.\nBen glanced up at him, looking surprised, like he\u2019d forgotten Five was there. Five gave no sign of his feelings and only focused on patching up a particularly bad scratch mark on Klaus\u2019s stomach. It looked as if someone (or something) had tried to claw out Klaus\u2019s insides. The thought made him feel queasy.\n\u201cKlaus was like a beacon for them,\u201d Ben said after a moment of silence. \u201cThe normal ones showed up a lot of course, but we usually ran into them by accident. But those things\u2026 they\u2019d seek him out. Hunt him down. I don\u2019t know what they wanted. They wouldn\u2019t bother with me, but they really liked him. If he was sober enough to see them, they always knew. They\u2019d\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 howl at him. Scream. It was awful.\u201d\nFive kept working for a moment, trying to hide the shaking of his hands. After a moment he could ease his breathing. \u201cI had no idea. I didn\u2019t think about it.\u201d\n\u201cNo one did.\u201d\nIt hurt, but it was the truth. No one had given Klaus\u2019s power much thought other than he could see dead people. In Five\u2019s head, when he had thought about it at all, he\u2019d always figured the dead were all like what Ben appeared to be. They were all Casper the friendly ghosts. They were just people.\nThere was a lot he didn\u2019t know about his siblings.\nSilence settled between them again. Five finished up with the last cut, gently covering it with a bandage. Klaus\u2019s breathing had eased, and he was resting against Ben\u2019s chest again, obviously exhausted.\n\u201cHey, Five?\u201d Ben asked.\nFive looked up, \u201cHmmm?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019re we going to do? We can\u2019t let Hargreeves keep locking him up. Klaus was terrified before, but now\u2026\u201d\nAt first Five didn\u2019t answer. Because he didn\u2019t know. He simply didn\u2019t know.\nIn his head, the plan had sounded easy enough. He\u2019d thought that he could fix everything. He told himself that if he\u2019d been there for Vanya, if he\u2019d stayed with his family instead of leaving, then things would have been different, and the apocalypse wouldn\u2019t have happened. So, he\u2019d taken them all back to the day he\u2019d disappeared.\nThey were supposed to just go with the timeline, and let things fall as they may. If they could be there for Vanya, help her control her power, let her be one of them\u2026 then that was it. Disaster avoided.\nBut he hadn\u2019t considered all the other pieces in play. He hadn\u2019t considered the rest of his siblings. How could he? He hadn\u2019t been there.\nAnd he was only beginning to realize what that meant.\n\u201cI\u2019m never letting Dad lock him up again. I promise.\u201d\nKlaus came back to himself slowly. He grappled for consciousness between staircases and hallways. He reached for Ben\u2019s voice through the haze and seized it like a lifeline. He saw Five, blurry around the edges like a photograph coming into focus. He remembered voices slipping between the moments of rotting graves and warm blankets. He wasn\u2019t sure who was alive and who was dead. Flickers of monsters danced at the corners of his vision.\nThen he opened his eyes, and all at once he was in Luther\u2019s bedroom, staring up at the ceiling.\n\u201cKlaus?\u201d\nHe tried to force himself not to flinch, but his body felt tight and weary and he couldn\u2019t quite convince his muscles to comply.\nVanya\u2019s face drifted into view. She looked exhausted and her mouth was pinched in a firm line, like when they had been kids (the first time) and she had been trying very hard not to yell at him for throwing up on her carpet after too much drinking.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Klaus forced himself to ask, trying very hard to keep his voice casual. The word caught in his throat and came out a low croak.\n\"You\u2019re awake.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t bother dignifying that with a response. He felt far away and scattered. He was a jigsaw puzzle and he couldn\u2019t find all the pieces.\nVanya swallowed hard and if he had the strength, Klaus was sure he would have felt guilty about ignoring her. \u201cUmmm, Five told me to stay with you\u2026 the others are in his room. They\u2019ve been arguing for twenty minutes now-\u201d\nKlaus tried to force a laugh. \u201cWhat did I do this time?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cObviously I\u2019ve really fucked up-\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault Klaus!\u201d Vanya spoke with ferocity, advancing on him with a sudden fire lighting her eyes, the irises clouding over with a threatening shade of white.\nDespite himself, Klaus found himself flinching away, cowering into the bed-covers like a child. Regret hit him instantly when she recoiled, wrapping her arms around herself. He could just stare as she composed herself and the colour returned to her eyes.\n\u201cSo\u2026 what did I miss?\u201d he croaked out.\n\u201cUmmm\u2026 Ben was really angry. He got into an argument with Hargreeves about locking you up. Then him and Luther-\u201d\n\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter\u2026\u201d She didn\u2019t correct him though. Five had drilled into their heads when they had arrived that they shouldn\u2019t be making too many changes. Klaus knew they had to play by the rules. But considering he was in Luther\u2019s bedroom instead of rotting in a mausoleum, he seemed to have been the only one who had paid attention to that particular conversation.\n\u201cFive is going to be pissed that Ben-\u201d\n\u201cFive\u2019s pissed at Hargreeves! They all are. Klaus, look at yourself.\u201d\nHe looked down and for the first time felt the full wave of pain wash over him. There were marks scattered around his body, bruises leaching into the too pale skin. Bandages covered the worst of the damage, but he could still see where crimson was bleeding into the white.\nHe remembered\u2026 flashes of the mausoleum. Like clips of a movie he\u2019d barely paid attention to. They had been\u2026 real. Physical manifestations. \u00a0That had been his fault, probably, unless the rules of the universe were rewriting themselves just to spite him. Somehow that wouldn\u2019t have surprised him either. He\u2019d been attacked. They\u2019d come for him, out of the darkness. He remembered them biting, scratching, clawing, screaming his name with fury and rage. They had been nightmares come alive.\nKlaus whimpered, and he wasn\u2019t sure if it was because of the memories or his body suddenly realizing the state it was in\nVanya was by his side in an instant, arms wrapped around his shoulders. She was warm and he leaned into her, grateful for her beating heart under his fingertips. She was alive. He was alive.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever say anything?\u201d she whispered into his hair.\nHe could hear the betrayal in her voice no matter how hard she tried to hide it. He knew what she really meant; why hadn\u2019t he said anything to her. They were two peas in a pod, after all. Two fucked up peas dealing with a whole lot of fucked up abuse.\n\u201cVanya,\u201d he started to say, but the words caught in the lump building in his throat.\nShe went to pull away, but he whimpered again, folding in on himself, chasing the warmth. She didn\u2019t move, only pulled a blanket over them gently, running her fingers soothingly through his hair.\n\u201cI should have said something when Luther put you in that room,\u201d he told her in a voice so low he could barely hear himself.\n\u201cKlaus, don\u2019t, this isn\u2019t the time-\u201d\n\u201cI knew what you were going through, and I didn\u2019t do anything to stop it. I didn\u2019t know what to do so I just didn\u2019t make a choice. It\u2019s not fair that I let them do that to you. I\u2019m no better than Dad.\u201d\nHe was breathing hard, words swallowed in big gulps of air and tears falling him his face. Vanya held him tighter and rocked him gently.\n\u201cKlaus, don\u2019t you dare compare yourself to him. Diego was right, Hargreeves is a monster. He\u2019s a terrible human being and he hurt us both and that is not our fault. Understand?\u201d\n\u201cNot our fault,\u201d Klaus repeated. She nodded into his hair. They stayed wrapped around each other for a very long time. Klaus had one hand gripped around her arm, terrified of her pulling away and leaving him to the cold and the screaming still echoing around his head. She didn\u2019t pull away though, not even when his breathing levelled out and the tears dried against his cheeks.\n\u201cVanya?\u201d he said after a long silence. \u201cWhat do we do now? Hargreeves is going to the mausoleum in the morning, and he\u2019s going to be really, really angry when I\u2019m not there. He\u2019s going to know it was you guys.\u201d\n\u201cKlaus, I promise you, no one in this house is going to send you back there, no matter what Hargreeves tries to do to us.\u201d\nDiego felt like a stranger to his own life.\nHe\u2019d thought he\u2019d had a good handle on what had happened to them during their childhood. It\u2019d been horrible, obviously\u2026 He\u2019d seen Vanya\u2019s isolation and Luther\u2019s obsession, and then Five had disappeared and Ben had died, and then they\u2019d all just broken apart.\nAnd then he\u2019d read Vanya\u2019s book, and she\u2019d pretty much summed it up. Yes, there had been training bordering on torture, they had been children forced into becoming soldiers, he\u2019d lived through it all. He\u2019d dealt with the stammer and the anxiety and the manipulation.\nHe\u2019d come out on the other side whole.\nIt just hadn\u2019t occurred to him that there might\u2019ve been more.\nApparently, there had been a whole lot they\u2019d all been missing. He\u2019d seen Klaus turn away from them and sink deeper into the drugs. He\u2019d just never considered why.\nActually, that was a lie.\nHe\u2019d assumed Klaus had been weak. Weaker than the rest of them, at least. Because that had been the logical conclusion. His brother hadn\u2019t been able to handle the training and their apathetic father. Diego had been under the assumption that Klaus, in some way, had allowed himself to be broken. He\u2019d been weak.\nDiego\u2019s stomach churned with guilt as Ben explained to the rest of their siblings exactly what they\u2019d been ignoring for thirty years. Klaus had been routinely locked in a mausoleum filled with dead bodies. Klaus had been terrified of the spirits that haunted him into his adulthood. Klaus had PTSD from Reginald\u2019s torture. Klaus was\u2026\nBroken?\nMaybe that wasn\u2019t fair\u2026 But Diego couldn\u2019t forget about the way his little brother had curled in on himself, gasping for air. Couldn\u2019t forget his eyes, glazed over in panic and pain. He hadn\u2019t been there for him. Not in this time line, and he hadn\u2019t been there in the first one either.\nThey were supposed to protect each other, and they hadn\u2019t.\nDiego had failed.\n\u201cWe need a plan,\u201d Five announced, as if this was just a normal day and his hands weren\u2019t covered in Klaus\u2019s blood.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Ben said, taking a step forward before Diego could even get the words out, \u201cthe plan is to never let Reginald near him again.\u201d\nFive just shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice thought, but the old man is going to have to retrieve him at some point. Don\u2019t you think he\u2019s going to be a little suspicious when he finds Klaus missing?\u201d\n\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d Diego asked from his place by the doorway. He was surprised by the tiredness in his own voice. He was exhausted. They were all exhausted. He wanted nothing more but to collapse into his bed and wish away the nights events as a dream. \u201cHow can you say that with our brother torn apart by the dead in the next room.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Ben said, rounding on Five, \u201cWhat do you want us to do? Put him back? What do you think will kill him first, the frostbite, or the angry spirits ready to tear him apart?\u201d\nIf Diego had to put money on which siblings would be arguing during at time of crisis, usually he would\u2019ve bet on himself and Luther. Ben and Five were at the bottom of his list, and not just because one had been dead for over a decade, and the other missing for seventeen years. Ben and Five were the logical ones. The calm ones. They always had been. The idea of Ben picking a fight with anyone was laughable. And yet, there they were, Ben looking just about ready to start throwing punches, and Five so angry his face was turning red.\n\u201cBen,\u201d said Five, slowly, as if talking to a child. His tone made Diego grit his teeth. Beside him, Ben\u2019s hands were closing into fists. \u201cWe have to think about this logically. I know we\u2026 we messed up. We didn\u2019t know-\u201d\nThat was the wrong thing to say.\nBen slammed his fists against the desk so hard the wood groaned under the weight. \u201cYou promised,\u201d he said through clenched teeth, \u201cYou promised we wouldn\u2019t let Hargreeves lock him up again!\u201d\n\u201cAnd I meant it. But we can\u2019t let Hargreeves know we rescued him. We can\u2019t change this timeline too drastically! Ben, listen to me. The more we change the timeline, the more noticeable we\u2019re going to become. The last time that happened our house got shot up and Klaus was kidnapped? You remember that part?\u201d\nBen glared at Five, and from under his shirt Diego saw movement. A subtle slithering under his skin. He was between them in seconds, ready out of habit. \u201cWhatever the hell this is, it\u2019s not helping Klaus.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Diego,\u201d Ben yelled, \u201cLet him finish. Do I remember what part? The part where our brother got kidnapped or the part where no one came to help him? Because if I\u2019m remembering right, I was the only person who was actually there for him!\u201d\nFive opened his mouth, closed it again, opened, closed. It was the first time Diego had ever seen him lost for words. The silence was piercing. Behind Five, Luther and Allison shifted uncomfortably, eyeing each other.\nGreat help they are, Diego thought ruefully.\nBut then, Allison took a step forward, carefully, as if afraid she was going to be chased off if she reminded them that she was present. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to admit it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut maybe Five is right? We\u2019re not ready to fight again so soon. We need to live this life out, like we planned.\u201d\nDiego was surprised when Ben surged forward, his fury suddenly pointing away from Five and at Allison. \u201cYou\u2019re just saying that so you can find Claire again!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, okay, maybe I want my daughter Ben. But I also want to survive into adulthood.\u201d\n\u201cLuther, what do you think?\u201d Five asked.\nDiego just shook his head and muttered, under his breath, \u201cWhy\u2019re you asking him, he\u2019s obviously going to side with Allison.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t have time for petty arguments. He wanted to join Vanya and Klaus. He wanted to make sure his brother was alright. He wanted to keep the ghosts away. He wanted to keep Reginald away. He just wanted everything to be okay again\u2026 But maybe it never had been \u201cokay.\u201d Maybe Diego had just been enjoying a blissful ignorance.\n\u201cActually\u2026 no.\u201d\nLuther was staring down at his shoes, not making eye contact with anyone, even as Allison rounded on him with a shrill, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t agree with you, Allison,\u201d he said slowly. Diego could barely believe the words coming out of Luther\u2019s mouth. \u201cListen, Five, Allison, I saw what Klaus was like in that mausoleum and it was awful. There\u2019s nothing you can say that\u2019ll make me put him back. And you need me to get that door open. I won\u2019t do it. I had no idea that Dad would ever do something like that to one of us\u2026 I swear, if I\u2019d known\u2026 I made a mistake with Vanya before. I\u2019m not making that mistake again\u2026\u201d Luther trailed off, eyes fluttering up from the ground. His gaze found Diego\u2019s, and he gave him a small nod. Diego understood.\n\u201cSo\u2026what do you want to do?\u201d Allison asked in a quiet voice. Diego knew she would never fight Luther. And besides, they had her and Five beat. He knew Vanya would never allow them to put Klaus back in the mausoleum. Not after what she\u2019d been through.\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Luther admitted, and Diego was just glad their Number One was over giving useless orders.\nDiego knew exactly what they should do. \u201cWe leave. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m done with this bullshit. You think staying with Hargreeves is going to help Vanya? Help any of us? Klaus is near catatonic because he was locked in a crypt with rotting corpses. We\u2019re leaving.\u201d\nHe turned to Five.\nHe looked small\u2026 young\u2026 Five seemed to slump under the weight of it all. His eyes were dark, and his skin looked paler than usual.\nFive looked at them all, and it seemed to dawn on him that he was being outvoted. \u201cI- I just\u2026 I can\u2019t protect you. I can\u2019t protect any of you if we\u2019re noticed. We barely escaped by the skin of our teeth the last time! I can\u2019t protect you, do you understand? They\u2019re going to send a lot worse than Hazel and Cha-Cha if they think we\u2019re actually making a difference. It\u2019s not just me they\u2019re going to be after. I can\u2019t protect you!\u201d\nThere was silence and it took a moment for Diego to realize that his siblings were waiting for him, not Luther, to talk.\n\u201cI\u2026 Five-\u201d He stopped. Hazel and Cha-Cha had been bad\u2026 They\u2019d shot up the house. They had taken Klaus. They had killed Eudora. Three of them hadn\u2019t been able to stop them, superpowers and all. The idea of going up against more people like them, people who were more than ready for them\u2026 that didn\u2019t sit well in Diego\u2019s gut. But neither did leaving Klaus to rot in the mausoleum. They couldn\u2019t leave him again, not even for a second. And he was done with playing Hargreeves\u2019s games. Diego was going to protect his siblings from their father this time around. He wasn\u2019t losing anyone else.\nAnd, if they could fight off Vanya, Cha-Cha, and an army of gunmen together, then they could fight off whatever crazies Five\u2019s ex-employers might throw at them. \u201cWe protect each other, Five. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve always done. Like in the theater. If we stick together, we\u2019ll be fine. No ones being sacrificed this time around.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nDiego\n\nThey were halfway through planning when the screaming started. They\u2019d been talking in only hushed tones and whispers, afraid of Pogo or Hargreeves hearing them. The scream was so loud Diego had to clamp his hands over his ears, flinching against the sound.\nBut then he realized what it was. Who it was.\nHe was the first to move, taking off running out the door with Ben right behind him. They raced down the corridor together as fast as they could.\nHe found Klaus huddled in a corner, sobbing, hands clasped around his ears.\nVanya was beside him. She hovered, hands outstretched as if about to touch him.\n\u201cVanya, what happened?\u201d Diego demanded. She startled, jumping up and rushing over to them. Vaguely, Diego clocked the sound of footsteps behind him and he knew the rest of their siblings had caught up.\n\u201cKlaus?\u201d Ben whispered.\nKlaus made no move he\u2019d heard either of them. The screaming had lowered into a slow, breathless trickle of, \u201cNo, no, leave me alone, no, no.\u201d\n\u201cVanya?\u201d Diego asked again, \u201cWhat. Happened?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered hoarsely. Tears streamed down her face. She was shaking as she spoke, wringing the corners of her pyjama shirt in her hands, \u201cHe seemed fine. He woke up before, and we talked a little. Then he drifted off\u2026 and he just started\u2026 I don\u2019t know! He was in pain and moving a lot and I think he thought he was trapped or held down or something. I tried to wake him up. And he just started screaming.\u201d\nDiego looked to Klaus again. He was shivering against the wall, rocking gently back and forth. His head wacked the brick in a gentle rhythm. Thuck. Thuck. Thuck.\nBen crouched beside him, but every time he reached out and his fingertips brushed Klaus\u2019s skin, the boy would flinch away, whimpering.\nLuther\u2019s voice came from somewhere behind them, \u201cDo you think Dad- do you think Hargreeves heard anything?\u201d\nThere was a moment of silence, of bated breath, as if they expected Hargreeves to hear his name and suddenly come running. When he didn\u2019t appear though Diego let out a long breath. \u201cNo, he\u2019s used to screaming in the night,\u201d he said, bitterly. Nightmares weren\u2019t a rare occurrence in the mansion, especially after days of hard training. He remembered nights of his own filled with visions of drowning in a dark tank or his own knives ending up in between his siblings\u2019 ribs. They\u2019d all awoken to screaming in the night\u2026\nIt was sick that he\u2019d never considered it strange or abnormal. He\u2019d never considered leaving his bed and seeking out whoever was in pain. They\u2019d learnt early on to leave each other alone. A Hargreeves family skill, apparently.\nLook where that had gotten them.\n\u201cIf he starts screaming again-\u201d Luther started. Diego shot him a glare, silencing him. But he\u2019d gotten the words out and the rest of their siblings eyed each other uneasily. If Hargreeves caught them, everything would be over. They wouldn\u2019t be able to escape. Klaus would be locked up in the mausoleum again. Diego didn\u2019t even want to consider his own punishment.\nThe thing Hargreeves hated more than anything else was disobedience.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Ben said from his position on the floor, \u201cEveryone out. I\u2019ll deal with this.\u201d\nAt first, they didn\u2019t move, hovering by the doorway, feet shuffling. But then Allison disappeared into the hallway, then Luther, Five, and finally Vanya trailing behind them.\nDiego didn\u2019t move.\n\u201cLet me help,\u201d he said. He needed to help. If he couldn\u2019t protect Klaus from ghosts, from Hargreeves, from drugs, he could at least do this one thing.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time to argue with you.\u201d\n\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d\nBen said nothing and only turned back to their brother.\nKlaus was almost catatonic. His eyes were unfocused, staring at nothing. His lips moved frantically, but no sound came out other than heaving gasps for air.\n\u201cKlaus, it\u2019s me,\u201d Ben said in a miraculously calm voice, \u201cIt\u2019s Ben.\u201d\nKlaus blinked, his eyes not moving from the spot on the wall he was staring at, but they seemed to focus and clear just a little. His breath hitched, the sound of a sob hitting the back of his throat.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m here,\u201d Ben continued, \u201cDo you know where you are?\u201d\nKlaus shook his head, and despite himself Diego felt relief flood through him because at least he was responding to something. Klaus seemed to shrink in on himself though, pressing his back flat against the wall, \u201cNo. No. Where- No.\u201d\nDiego\u2019s stomach dropped, but Ben just nodded his head. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s okay. We\u2019re at home. In Vanya\u2019s room. I\u2019m going to touch you, okay-\u201d\nBen reached out, fingertips brushing Klaus\u2019s arm.\nA scream ripped from Klaus\u2019s throat. A horrible, agonized scream that was painful and raw and sent shivers down Diego\u2019s spine.\n\u201cNo, please don\u2019t touch me. Don\u2019t touch me, don\u2019t touch me, don\u2019t touch me.\u201d\nBen pulled back as if he\u2019d been burned. He was on his feet in a flash, stumbling away until he was safely beside Diego.\n\u201cIf he k-keeps going then so-someone\u2019s going to hear,\u201d Diego said.\nBen only blinked at him slowly. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cBen, someone\u2019s going to hear him. We have to do something!\u201d\nBen nodded, slowly at first, and then more forcefully as the situation seemed to dawn on him. \u201cI don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know what to do. He\u2019s never been this bad before.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s been like this before?\u201d The thought made Diego feel slightly faint for a moment. Was this a regular occurrence for Ben and Klaus? How many times had Klaus had a breakdown on the street? At a party with no one to help him?\nBen ran a trembling hand through his hair. \u201cOkay, umm, usually he needs someone whose alive.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re alive.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I am right now. But he might not know that! Diego, you\u2019ve got to calm him down.\u201d\nDiego looked to Klaus. Klaus, his brother who he\u2019d let down so many times. Who he\u2019d allowed to be tortured, by both Hazel and Cha-Cha, and now Reginald Hargreeves. Who he\u2019d lost to a war, who he\u2019d lost to drugs years before that.\n\u00a0\u201cO-o-okay,\u201d Diego whispered. He couldn\u2019t fail him again.\nDiego took a step forward, dropping to his knees as he\u2019d seen Ben do. Klaus was shaking, arms wrapped around his knees, eyes staring blankly ahead.\nHe wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. Klaus was vibrance and jokes and smiles. Klaus was crazy ideas that might just work and warm hugs whether you wanted them or not. Klaus was energy and life and movement. Klaus was not this\u2026 this sobbing child, half out of his mind with fear. Klaus wasn\u2019t this deathly pale. He wasn\u2019t empty eyes. He wasn\u2019t broken.\nAt least\u2026 he\u2019d never allowed himself to be seen as broken.\nThe thought settled uneasily in Diego\u2019s stomach and made him feel nauseous.\n\u201cK-Klaus,\u201d he said, feeling the sound catch at the back of his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s Diego. Umm, you\u2019re not in the mausoleum, okay?\u201d\nAnd maybe that hadn\u2019t been the best thing to say because Klaus began to whimper, making small sounds in the back of his throat that were a mix between crying and laughing. Diego inched closer, until his fingertips brushed against Klaus\u2019s elbow. Klaus flinched a little, cowering into the wall, but he didn\u2019t scream.\nDiego took that as a good sign.\nInstead of pulling away, he leaned in closer, wrapping his hand loosely around Klaus\u2019s arm.\n\u201cI\u2019m alive. Ben\u2019s alive. You\u2019re okay,\u201d Diego whispered, trying to copy Ben\u2019s tone from earlier.\n\u201cDiego?\u201d Klaus whispered. His voice hitched between syllables.\n\u201cY-yeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s dead. They\u2019re all dead. They won\u2019t go away.\u201d\n\u201cI-I-I-I\u2019m not dead. Klaus we\u2019re alive. M-m-m-me and B-b-b-ben. We\u2019re here. L-l-look.\u201d He moved his hand, slowly, carefully, from Klaus\u2019s arm to wrist. From there he pulled his hand to his chest and laid Klaus\u2019s fingers flat against his heart.\n\u201cYou feel that? I\u2019m alive, okay? We\u2019re here and we\u2019re not leaving you?\u201d\nFor the first time Klaus\u2019s eyes flickered. They left the wall and he turned, fully facing Diego. His bloodshot eyes were brimming with tears, but they were present and focused and Diego felt himself almost collapse in relief.\nWithout waiting another second he threw himself forward, wrapping his arms around Klaus and pulling them together. His brother sobbed, going limp against his chest.\nBen was there too, suddenly pressed up against the two of them, rubbing circles on Klaus\u2019s back.\nThey sat like that for a long time. Diego let his head rest against the wall, exhaustion making his head swim. Ben was a comforting weight pressed against them. Klaus shivered and sobbed in his lap and Diego was happy to hold him, to know that for the moment everyone was safe.\nIt was when Klaus stopped crying that Diego came back to himself. He was sure they\u2019d dozed for longer than they\u2019d meant to. Ben was rubbing sleep from his eyes and rubbing his aching muscles from where he\u2019d been scrunched up against Klaus\u2019s back.\n\u201cHey, Klaus?\u201d Diego whispered, running a hand through his brother\u2019s unruly mess of curls. The boy was unnervingly still in his lap.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYou, errr\u2026 had a nightmare?\u201d Diego asked. The question sounded desperately inadequate for what Klaus had gone through.\nKlaus snorted though and relaxed in Diego\u2019s arms. \u201cYep. I had a nightmare. Those darn things, right?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026 errr\u2026 wana talk about it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not particularly.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe later? That okay\u201d\n\u201cYeah. That\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cThanks Diego.\u201d\n\u201cHey, Klaus? You wana know a secret?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting the hell out of here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nLuther\n\nLuther had been planning on finding Allison. He needed to explain himself, explain why he hadn\u2019t sided with her against the others. She\u2019d ignored him in the hallway and had purposely walked too fast for him to catch up when Five had sent them off to collect supplies.\nSo, he was understandably shocked when he turned around to find her lurking in his doorway.\n\u201cHey,\u201d she said with a look that wasn\u2019t exactly a smile but wasn\u2019t exactly a glare either. He supposed he could work with that.\n\u201cListen, Allison-\u201d he began. She put her hand up to stop him.\n\u201cI\u2019m not mad\u2026 I mean, I was. Obviously\u2026 but I had a moment to think. And you were right.\u201d\n\u201cI was?\u201d he repeated, dumbly.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d She seemed to hesitate, and then walked into the room, settling on the bed. He sat beside her, their knees grazing each other. It was an automatic thing. Something they\u2019d done as children. Even before anything had happened between them, they\u2019d always been close. She\u2019d always been the sibling he could count on. It\u2019d been them against the world.\nUntil the world got too hard to handle.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see him, Allison,\u201d he said, slowly. He didn\u2019t want to have this conversation with her. She wasn\u2019t mad at him, wasn\u2019t looking for a fight, but he had to say it. He had to tell her what he\u2019d seen. \u201cKlaus was just\u2026 he was covered in blood. He was so scared. He didn\u2019t even know we were there. It was\u2026Terrifying.\u201d\nAllison nodded. She wasn\u2019t looking at him, but at the floor.\n\u201cI trust you, Luther,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you think this is what we should do\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThis is the only thing we can do.\u201d He\u2019d never felt more sure about anything else in his life. He couldn\u2019t get the image of Klaus out of his head. Klaus, who could take Luther choking him with a smile. Who would always get hit the hardest during training and jump up cracking a joke immediately afterwards.\nKlaus who he\u2019d had to carry out of a goddamn mausoleum covered in blood.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to sound cruel.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re just scared?\u201d\nAllison\u2019s gaze flickered to his and she smiled just slightly. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared as hell. I\u2019m scared for my daughter. I\u2019m scared she\u2019s not even going to be born. I\u2019m scared she\u2019s going to die at ten years old because our sister loses control of her powers. I\u2019m scared-\u201d\n\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Luther soothed, reaching out to take her hand in his. \u201cI\u2019m scared too. That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this. I\u2019m tired of being scared. I\u2019m tried of playing his games. Seeing Klaus\u2026 I just realized how tired I am of watching him hurt everyone all over again. Dad\u2019s the reason Vanya almost destroyed the world. He\u2019s the reason Klaus is like he is. I mean\u2026 he lied to me. To us. For so long. And now we have a chance to stop that all from happening. Don\u2019t you think we should take it?\u201d\n\u201cI know. I know you\u2019re right\u2026 I just-\u201d\n\u201cWhen this is all over, you\u2019re going to see your daughter again.\u201d\n\u201cYou promise?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. If we can bring one brother back from the dead and the other can escape from an evil time-travel organisation, I think we can manage to rescue one little girl from the timeline.\u201d\nAllison\u2019s sniffles became a short laugh and she smiled at Luther, all bright teeth and dimples.\n\u201cThanks Luther.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nFive\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean none of you know how to hot-wire a car?\u201d Five asked, dumbfounded. They\u2019d had a plan. A good plan. Grab some food, clothing, and a few of Hargreeves\u2019 most expensive looking belongings to pawn off. Then get a car, and drive until morning. The rest would come to them, but at least they had a beginning. They had twelve percent of a plan. And twelve percent of a plan was better than no plan at all. Five could work with twelve percent.\nSomehow the fact that no one knew how to steal a car hadn\u2019t come up.\nThey\u2019d picked out one of Hargreeves\u2019 vans that was big enough to fit them all. He had quite the collection of cars, as most people with way too much money did. Diego had even managed to switch the plates around on a few of them so that they\u2019d be less easy to track so soon.\nBut that didn\u2019t matter if they couldn\u2019t even start the car.\n\u201cDiego?\u201d Five asked. Diego shook his head. \u201cSeriously?\u201d\n\u201cI was training to be a cop, bro. Why would I know how to do that?\u201d\nFive turned to Klaus, the top contender in the family for who would know how to hot-wire a car. The boy was trembling next to Diego though, eyes vacant and roaming the garage like he expected the monsters from his nightmares to start slipping through the walls. And maybe they were.\nFive turned to Ben instead. \u201cBen? You can\u2019t tell me you and Klaus never had to hot-wire a car?\u201d\nBen shrugged apologetically. \u201cKlaus was too high to drive most of the time. There was no point.\u201d\nFive couldn\u2019t believe this. He could not believe this! Did none of their family have any actual skills? Oh, you can dead-lift an elephant? You\u2019ve acted in twenty-three movies? Well, that\u2019s great and all but what about anything useful? No, of course not!\nThen Luther said, \u201cWhat about you, Five? You drive.\u201d\nBecause of course Luther had to contribute. Sometimes he really was a moron. \u201cYeah I\u2019m standing here asking you all about stealing cars for fun. I really enjoy just chatting with you guys. We don\u2019t do it often enough. Really should work on catching up. While I\u2019m here anyone else know how to teleport by any chance?\u201d\nWhy was he the only family member with a brain?\nSilence settled over them as they stood in the darkness of the garage. This was their only plan and it all depended on stealing that van.\nAllison was the one to break it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to get the keys.\u201d\nShe was right, even if Five didn\u2019t want to admit it. Because that was going to lead to a whole other boatload of problems-\n\u201cNo. No way.\u201d Diego was glaring furiously at them all. Well, all except Klaus. Klaus, he had a protective arm around as if he could physically fight off all the invisible intangible dead. \u201cIt\u2019s almost five in the morning. We got lucky getting out unnoticed the first time around. Mom and Pogo are going to be awake soon.\u201d\nThey all started talking at once. Luther hissing angrily at Diego, Ben muttering under his breath, Allison trying to shush them frantically, and even Vanya trying to have her voice heard over the chaos. Sometimes Five really missed the apocalypse\u2026 Or at least people his own age.\n\u201cOkay, okay, shut up.\u201d\nThey fell silent.\n\u201cAs the adult of the group,\u201d Five begin, ignoring the chorus of protests coming from the thirteen-year-olds. \u201cAs the adult of the group,\u201d he said, louder, \u201cand the one who got you all into this mess from the beginning, (again he ignored the next chorus of protests.) I\u2019ll go back in. We need the keys, or we\u2019re never getting out.\u201d\nBen nodded at them violently, as if afraid now was the time they were all going to back out and creep back into bed as if nothing had happened. \u201cAnd we need to get out.\u201d He glanced at Klaus, who had yet to speak since leaving the house. He had yet to respond to much of anything other than answering a couple soft questions from Diego and Ben before they\u2019d left. Five doubted Klaus knew much about what was going on. He could only hope the psychological damage from the mausoleum would be undone the more distance they put between themselves and their father.\nAllison took a step forward. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you. If we run into anyone, I can rumor them long enough for us to get out of there.\u201d\nFive nodded hesitantly. He\u2019d have preferred to just teleport in and out, but she was right. If he was seen by any of the adults, it was game over. Allison had never used her power on Hargreeves, as far as he could tell, but that didn\u2019t mean he was impervious. Their father was as much a mortal man as the rest of them\u2026. He hoped\u2026.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nAllison\n\nThe good news was that they knew exactly where Hargreeves (or at least his drivers) kept the car keys.\nThe bad news was that the cabinet was on the other side of the house.\nTo get to it they\u2019d have to pass not only Hargreeves\u2019 office but Pogo\u2019s and Mom\u2019s rooms as well. And the sun was rising.\nAllison barely allowed herself to breathe as they slipped through the shadows of the house.\nThey almost made it all the way into the kitchen before they heard footsteps behind them.\nSomeone was awake.\nWithout thinking Allison threw open the nearest door and pushed Five inside before quietly pulling the door closed behind them. They held their breaths, bracing against the door. The echo of footsteps came closer and closer and didn\u2019t fade. There was the light sound of humming.\nIt was Mom\u2026 she was probably moving around the kitchen, preparing breakfast for the household. The children would be expected at the dining table soon. Allison didn\u2019t want to think about Hargreeves\u2019 face when he found himself alone for breakfast.\nAllison turned and slid down the wall. They were going to be hiding out for a while.\nThey were in a bedroom\u2026 or at least, what had once been a bedroom. Grayed sheets were hung over the furniture and it smelled damp and musty. No one had been in the room for a very long time. They\u2019d be safe for a while at least.\nOutside. Mom\u2019s footsteps were clear as day. She\u2019d find their empty beds within the hour. Allison wondered how long it\u2019d be until she told Hargreeves of their disappearance. Would she wait, expecting them to turn up with donut powder around their mouths and tired eyes? Or would she put two and two together and know they\u2019d left her alone with Hargreeves?... again.\n\u201cI can get your daughter back.\u201d\nThe sentence was so unexpected she found herself staring dumbly at Five in confusion.\n\u201cYour daughter,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI can probably get her back for you\u2026 or at least\u2026 you know\u2026 get you to\u2026 er\u2026 do the \u201cdeed\u201d with-\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2026 what?\u201d\nHe huffed at her. \u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t want to leave, right?\u201d he asked slowly, as if explaining something very simple to a child. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t want to lose her? You think if we leave you won\u2019t be able to meet that guy or whatever-\u201d\n\u201cPatrick.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever. You think you won\u2019t meet Patrick and\u2026 make\u2026 her.\u201d\nShe stared at him. Was Five trying to be nice? Was he trying to make her feel better? Five? She\u2019d always thought he was disappointed in her somehow. She didn\u2019t even want to consider what he would do with her powers\u2026 make a lot of people disappear, probably. She knew he definitely wouldn\u2019t use them for fame or wealth\u2026. He wouldn\u2019t have forced anyone to love him, if he had her powers\u2026\nShe got the impression that he\u2019d expected more from her. He\u2019d expected better.\nInstead of saying all that, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said \u201cmake\u201d her.\u201d Maybe it was the stress from the night, of the image of baby Claire popping out of an easy-bake oven, but she started giggling and after a moment so did he. \u201cYou\u2019re a sixty-year-old man, just say sex,\u201d she said between breathy chuckles she hoped were smothered underneath her hands. The last thing she needed was Mom or Pogo or, god forbid, Hargreeves, opening the door to find her and Five giggling like lunatics.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way,\u201d Five snorted. \u201cI just\u2026 I used to do this for a living. Change one thing, you change history. I was good at it. I could probably change it back too, you know? I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. And she meant it. She didn\u2019t know if she could believe him. They didn\u2019t even know where they\u2019d be in twenty-four hours or how they were going to feed themselves when the (stolen) money would run out. But he was trying. And maybe he was right\u2026 maybe she could convince Patrick to fall in love with her again. The right way, this time.\nIf she could convince herself to leave Luther once again.\nAnd in a decade that would be important\u2026 but at that moment they were thirteen and her brother was hurt and they were running away.\nThe next time they spoke Five said, \u201cIt\u2019s quiet. I think we\u2019re in the clear.\u201d\n---\nThey had no more run-ins before making it to the cabinet where Hargreeves kept his extravagant collection of car keys.\nTo call it a cabinet would be to call the opera a high school play. The structure was as tall as Allison had been (would be?) grown up, and so now it towered above both of them. It was made of smooth polished oak and was encrusted in gold ribbons and delicate carvings. It took both of them to heft the door open.\nThey were met with row upon row of car keys.\n\u201cThere has to be a hundred here!\u201d Five said as if personally offended by each and every key.\nAllison nodded. \u201cAt least\u2026 Which one is it?\u201d\n\u201cYou think I know?\u201d\nShe shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to just pick one at random.\u201d They really didn\u2019t have the time to be bickering over keys. They could be discovered at any moment.\nFive massaged the bridge of his nose, glancing between Allison and the keys. He had that look on his face that clearly said \u2018I-am-the-smartest-person-in-this-conversation-and-you-are-light-years-beneath-me-but-I-am-going-to-dumb-this-down-for-you.\u2019\n\u201cAnd what? Parade around in a-\u201d He stopped, glaring at her, mouth opening and closing soundlessly.\n\u201c\u2026 You don\u2019t know any cars do you?\u201d\n\u201cNot from this time period, no! I can tell you what car Hitler drove in the-\u201d\n\u201cYeah, maybe later,\u201d she said, and in one fluid moment tipped half a dozen keys into her skirt. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to have to take them all and see what happens. Come on, help me grab some.\u201d\nFive didn\u2019t move. At first Allison thought he was just going to argue with her but when she turned around, he was staring behind her, suddenly looking very pale.\nShe dropped the keys and spun on her heels.\nMom was standing in the middle of the hallway, smiling sweetly at them.\n\u201cAllison. Five. What are you doing out of bed so early? Do you want to help me make breakfast?\u201d\nAllison glanced at Five. Her rumor powers wouldn\u2019t work on a robot. If they\u2019d met into Pogo, they\u2019d have had a chance. If they\u2019d been found by Hargreeves\u2026 well\u2026 at least she\u2019d have a chance to settle things peacefully before Five probably tried to murder him. But Mom?\n\u201cWe\u2019re just\u2026\u201d Allison began, lamely, when Five didn\u2019t answer, \u201c\u2026 just about to go back to bed.\u201d\nMom cocked her head to the side. \u201cWhat are doing with all those keys, silly?\u201d she asked, voice still light and sugary.\nAllison gulped. \u201cUmm\u2026\u201d\nFive cleared his throat. \u201cMom, what keys are for the errr\u2026\u201d He faltered. \u201c\u2026 big\u2026van? The white one?\u201d\nOne day Allison was going to teach Five car basics.\nMom stared at them for a second\u2026 and then two\u2026 three\u2026\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. Allison and Five exchanged guilty glances.\n\u201cMom-\u201d Allison began.\n\u201cSecond row from the top. Fifth one from the right.\u201d\nAllison blinked. She looked up and then, slowly, slid the key off its hook. \u201cMom-\u201d she tried to say again, tears filling her eyes. But Mom shook her head.\n\u201cKeep each other safe, children. He\u2019ll come after you. But you\u2019re smart. You\u2019re going to be fine. Your father can\u2019t hurt you anymore.\u201d\nAllison rushed forward and flung her arms around Mom. She gripped her back tightly.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry we\u2019re leaving you alone with him,\u201d she whispered through tears.\nMom just stroked her hair. There was a weight behind her, and Allison looked down to find Five joining the hug.\nLooked like even psychopathic senior citizens had emotions.\n\u201cYou have to go now, children,\u201d Mom said, finally, pulling away from the hug. \u201cOr he\u2019ll catch you.\u201d\nAllison gave Mom one last kiss to the cheek before she and Five took off running.\n\nKlaus\n\nEverything was going to be fine.\nHe was not going back to the mausoleum.\nHargreeves was not going to catch them.\nHe was not going back to the mausoleum.\nStop. Breath. In. Out. Slowly.\nHonestly, how did people survive without drugs? Klaus thought his heart was going to rip out of his chest. Who even invented being sober? Who decided that was a good idea?\nOh\u2026 right\u2026 he did\u2026. God he was stupid.\nBen was sat beside him. He was gripping his hand so tightly, Klaus was pretty sure he was going to start losing circulation in .5 seconds. He had to force himself not to flinch away from the touch. Because Ben was alive. Not dead. Very alive. There were no dead people here. In fact, the world felt eerily quiet.\nExcept for Five and Allison, they were all sitting in the back of the van. Five had demanded he be the one to drive, and Allison had been elected to sit up front with him in order to rumour any cops if they were pulled over. Because yeah\u2026 thirteen-year olds driving tended to catch attention. If they were lucky, they\u2019d make it out of the city without anyone calling the police on a van full of actual children.\nThe rest of them were left to find the most comfortable looking suitcases and hold on for dear life. Although it was uncomfortable, Klaus would take being wedged between two bags in the back of a small van over being locked in the mausoleum any day.\nDiego smiled at him from where he was lounging across Allison\u2019s bright pink duffle bag. \u201cWe\u2019re almost out,\u201d he whispered to Klaus under his breath.\nKlaus did his best to smile back.\nThey were almost away. They had almost changed history.\nThen the car stopped.\nKlaus\u2019 stomach dropped. He could see the rest of them tense up. Vanya was the first to move. She leapt up and made her way to the doors.\n\u201cWait.\u201d Someone said\u2026 Luther, maybe. But she\u2019d already flung the door open.\nHargreeves was waiting for them. He was eerily calm, face unreadable. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\nPogo and Mom stood behind him, and beside them lingered Five and Allison, looking unsure of what they should do. Klaus didn\u2019t even know what they should do. Were they actually going to fight Hargreeves? Or run back into the mansion with their tails between their legs?\nHe didn\u2019t think any of them had ever considered using their powers against Hargreeves\u2026 Well any of them except Klaus. As a child, Klaus had fantasized about his father being able to see the dead like he could. About locking him in the mausoleum so that he\u2019d suffer as Klaus had. Those types of thoughts had comforted him between the nightmares.\nHe wondered if Luther had ever fantasized about ripping Hargreeves limb from limb\u2026 probably not.\nFrom where he was sitting, Klaus could only see Vanya\u2019s back, but he could see her trembling against the dawn light. Diego got up slowly and joined her so that they both stood in the doorway like two guards. They were so small in their thirteen-year-old bodies, Klaus could see Hargreeves\u2019 face towering over them.\nDiego was the only one to speak. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d\n\u201cHmmf,\u201d was the reply, as if Diego had remarked on nothing more interesting than the weather. He shook his head in disappointment. \u201cYou will get out of the van. Now.\u201d\nNo one moved, but neither did they close the doors.\nKlaus was more than happy to stay in the darkness of the van, cowering with Ben in the shadows.\n\nI\u2019m not going back. I\u2019m not going back. I\u2019m not going back. I\u2019m not going back.\n\nThen Allison took a step forward. \u201cI heard a rumour-\u201d\nKlaus didn\u2019t see what Hargreeves pulled out of his pocket. He only saw the movement, lightning fast, and then the ear-splitting siren cracked through the air.\nIt was horrible. Louder than anything he\u2019d heard before. His hands slammed over his ears, but it was too late. The noise was in his brain. It crashed and snarled like a wild thing in his skull. He wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if his ears were bleeding.\nDiego and Vanya toppled out of the van and twitched on the ground, their own hands over their ears. Ben\u2019s hand disappeared from his, but Klaus couldn\u2019t turn to check on his brother. He couldn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t do anything but convulse on the ground in agony.\nA dark shape took up his vision. At first, he thought he was passing out. But then the shape latched onto Klaus\u2019 wrist and yanked him forward. He was dragged across the floor and then onto the gravel. He barely noticed his skin scraping against the rocks. Hargreeves was dragging him by his wrist, which meant one ear was unprotected.\nThe siren was still ringing.\nKlaus was dragged across the lawn. At first, he thought Hargreeves was taking him back to the house, but then he turned left, and Klaus was dragged away from the front door and towards-\nThe mausoleum!\nHe fought harder, pulling his arm, digging his toes into the mud. Hargreeves refused to let go, his grip tightening so hard Klaus could feel his skin bruising.\nHis father was talking, but Klaus could only make out the movement of his lips. He probably wasn\u2019t missing much. He already knew what a disappointment he was.\n\nI can\u2019t go back. I can\u2019t go back. I can\u2019t go back.\n\nThe dead were going to tear him apart. He was going to die in the dark. Alone.\nThe noise was so loud his head throbbed, his ear drums were fracturing in his head, and there was static filling his brain. He couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t move. There was just pain and the tight grip on his wrist.\nIt took a moment for Klaus to realize Hargreeves had stopped. His father was standing stock still in the middle of the lawn.\nHe was looking at the mausoleum door.\nThe mausoleum door that was trembling against its hinges.\nNo\u2026 not trembling\u2026 shaking\u2026 violently.\nAlmost like hundreds of people were slamming their fists against it trying to escape.\nNo, not people, Klaus realized. The dead.\nAs soon as the words entered his head, it was like the magic word had been spoken.\nThe door exploded off its hinges and sailed over their heads.\nThere were bodies piling out of the door, scrabbling on their hands, clambering over each other, clawing at the grass, screaming at the light. Their skin was ripped from their bodies, hair melted like wax against their skulls, skin as white as paper, fingernails black and rotted. Corpses. A lot of corpses.\nNightmares come to life.\nExcept they didn\u2019t round on Klaus as they had done for years. For his whole life.\nInstead every single pair of eyes was transfixed on his father.\nThe world held still.\nAnd then they pounced.\nHargreeves was ripped away from him in a flurry of bony limbs and rotting flesh.\nKlaus dropped to the ground like a stone. He couldn\u2019t lift his head to watch. Instead he buried his face in the grass, hands clamped firmly over his ears. The siren was loud and grating and agonizing but he could still hear the shrieks and howling piercing through.\nHis vision was tunnelling.\nHe could see nothing but the wet grass and someone\u2019s feet frantically kicking out as something held them down-\nNope. Nope. Look away.\nThen he noticed the little device just a few inches away from him. It must\u2019ve fallen from Hargreeves\u2019 pocket. It was just a small rectangle with a switch on its side. Such a simple little thing. Something their father must\u2019ve designed years ago. Maybe when Vanya\u2019s powers first became out of control. Or even before that. When Luther first lifted his crib into the air with one hand.\nHe must\u2019ve known this day would come.\nWith great difficultly, Klaus dragged his body over the grass, wrapped his fingers around the device, and flipped the switch.\nThe siren ended.\nAnd then, with great relief, Klaus finally lost consciousness.\n\u00a0\nHe awoke slowly and with a vicious headache. His head was on something soft. He was warm. There were vibrations underneath him.\nHis eyes flickered open.\nHis head was cradled on Diego\u2019s lap. Someone had placed a blanket over him. They were all in the van.\nThey were safe.\nBen was staring with worried eyes beside him, but when Klaus\u2019 gaze met his, he smiled.\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d\nKlaus winced at the noise.\n\u201cHeadache?\u201d Ben asked, a small smirk of sympathy on his lips. \u201cYeah, we all got \u2018em.\u201d\n\u201cBasted,\u201d Diego added. Klaus grinned up at the floating head that was his brother above him. He didn\u2019t move off his lap. He was probably the most comfortable he\u2019d been in days.\n\u201cKlaus\u2026\u201d Ben started. He bit his lip and Klaus had the sudden feeling that he was in trouble. Which was nothing new, of course, it was just his head hurt a lot. \u201cWhat happened to Hargreeves?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Klaus asked. Or tried to. His whole face felt kind of funny and he couldn\u2019t really hear his own voice, so it sounded more like \u2018wha\u2019ooo\u2019m\u2019n?\u2019\n\u201cWhen we found you,\u201d Diego said, \u201cYou were just on the grass by yourself. You had the noise thingy\u2026 but Hargreeves was gone. What happened?\u201d\nKlaus thought for a moment.\nWhat had happened?\n\u201cHe got what he deserved.\u201d\nBen and Diego both looked at each other. He knew he was going to be questioned later. Luther was going to want to know what had happened, at least. And when reports of a mission billionaire made it to the news\u2026 well he was going to have some explaining to do.\nBut for now his head hurt and he wanted to rest.\nAnd his brothers seemed to understand because they both sat back.\nThere was nothing but the sound of the van engine and the feeling of miles of road passing them by.\nThey were free. They were going to change history.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
