    "text": "Harry woke up on the morning of his nineteenth birthday, mind already buzzing. He and Ron and Hermione were going to catch a Quidditch game today\u2014not the Cannons, to Ron\u2019s disappointment\u2014and then spend some time around the neighborhood where Hermione had grown up. Apparently there was someone there who could get pigeons to do amazing tricks, and a small Indian restaurant that would set your mouth on fire for the rest of your life. It was exactly the kind of day Harry liked now that he was done with the war and NEWTS study and all the rest of it, lazy and slow and normal.\nIt was normal until he looked into the mirror above the bathroom sink, anyway.\nSomething was written around his throat in delicate, precise handwriting that looked somehow familiar, in what seemed to be red ink. Harry leaned closer and frowned, turning his head so that he could see the whole of it.\nIn the end, though, he had to conjure another mirror that would float behind him, because he honestly couldn\u2019t read the whole thing.\n\nProperty of the Half-Blood Prince.\n\n\u201cWell, fuck,\u201d Harry said, scowling.\n*\n\u201cIt\u2019s a soul-mark. I\u2019ve read about them. They\u2019re really rare.\u201d\nRon rolled his eyes at Harry from safely behind Hermione\u2019s head, but then ruined it by saying, \u201cImagine, mate. She\u2019s read about them.\u201d\nHermione had grown skilled at conjuring pillows to hit Ron over the head with, which she did now. Ignoring the stares they got from the others in the Quidditch stands, she leaned forwards and whispered urgently, \u201cIt means that you have the potential to have something great and world-shattering with the person whose mark it is, Harry. How does it feel?\u201d\n\u201cItchy.\u201d\n\u201cHarry!\u201d\n\u201cWell, it is.\u201d Harry had finally found a spell that would conceal the whole fucking thing, which he had to use another mirror to see. He rubbed at his neck and sighed. Logically, the tickle of the magic was less irritating than the itch, but he still seemed to feel it. \u201cAnd you say potential, Hermione. So there\u2019s no magical law that Snape and I need to unite or die?\u201d\n\u201cUnite or die.\u201d Ron snickered. \u201cWhat kind of novels have you been reading, Harry?\u201d\nThis time, Harry was the one who conjured the pillow to hit Ron over the head with, while Hermione said, \u201cOf course not. Soul-marks show up sometimes when a person\u2019s already dead or on the other side of the world. Or you might be born in the same country and time as your soulmate and still never meet them. It just means potential.\u201d\n\u201cSo instead of world-shattering Snape and I could have something lab-shattering, like.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you thinking, Harry?\u201d\n\u201cJust this,\u201d Harry said quietly. \u201cYou told me that Snape doesn\u2019t have a corresponding mark, that they only appear on one person at a time.\u201d Hermione nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad. He\u2019s been branded enough for one lifetime. So there\u2019s no need to trouble him with it. He\u2019s struggled with being leashed and having masters who didn\u2019t really understand him.\u201d Harry loved Dumbledore, but he was still a little angry with him for what he\u2019d done to Snape, forcing the man to participate in getting Harry to die. \u201cSo I\u2019ll leave him alone now.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014what if he finds out?\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to tell him?\u201d Harry lowered his voice and glanced around suspiciously. \u201cIs there someone hiding here under an Invisibility Cloak? Does one of you have a secret correspondence with him?\u201d\nHermione looked on the verge of conjuring a pillow just for Harry. \u201cOf course not! But things like this have a way of coming out. And you might need help from Snape sometime in the future, or he might need yours.\u201d\nHarry snorted. \u201cHe\u2019s out of prison and living a quiet life partially thanks to my testimony. And I won\u2019t go to him for help.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019d rather die than do that?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Because he\u2019s given me enough, and I won\u2019t ask him for anything else.\u201d\nHermione blinked, then said slowly, \u201cOkay, I can see that. And that might even be why the mark showed up. Because magic knows that you won\u2019t ask anything from him or try to use him the way other people might.\u201d\nHarry grimaced. \u201cIf that\u2019s the only reason, I sure hope Snape has something in his life that\u2019s not just me.\u201d\n\u201cHarry, promise me one thing?\u201d Ron waited until Harry had looked up at him and nodded. \u201cIf you ever decide to change your mind and start fucking Snape, then learn the Memory Charm well enough that you can Obliviate me.\u201d\nThis time, Harry and Hermione\u2019s pillows hit Ron at the same time.\n*\n\u201cMr. Snape wants me to serve as a\u2014reference?\u201d\nIt was still unnatural for Harry to speak Snape\u2019s name without trying to put the title \u201cProfessor\u201d in front of it, if he was going to use one at all, but that was the only reason he was hesitant. Still, the person on the other end of the Floo seemed to interpret it differently. \u201cNot him! No, no. We just know of his recent past, and we\u2019re contacting people who can testify to his good qualities before we hire him as a potions contractor for the Ministry.\u201d\nHarry smiled. \u201cHe has plenty of good qualities, but he doesn\u2019t interact well with people. Don\u2019t put him in direct contact with clients.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir. One of our other references had already said the same thing. But what are his good qualities?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s great at brewing. He\u2019s brave, so I can\u2019t believe he would balk at unusual requests or be afraid to test out experimental ingredients. He\u2019s detailed and meticulous and will return potions that have picky requirements done to perfection. He doesn\u2019t let personal feelings interfere with his brewing\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou have proof of that, sir?\u201d\nIt was still unusual for Harry to hear himself addressed that way, but he just shrugged. \u201cYes. He had to brew Wolfsbane for a werewolf he hated during my school years. He always did it on time.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Enthusiastic scribbling. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t an example our other references gave us.\u201d\n\u201cThey probably didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d Harry leaned back. \u201cDo you need anything else to hire Mr. Snape?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026of course some of our people are reluctant to work with a former Death Eater even with Harry Potter serving as a reference\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt depends on what you\u2019re hiring for. It\u2019s true that he\u2019s never going to be the most pleasant person to work with. But you\u2019re looking for someone who will do his work on time and do it perfection, right?\u201d\n\u201cWell. Um. We\u2019d also like to have someone who doesn\u2019t make the trainees assigned to collect his potions cry.\u201d\nHarry shrugged. \u201cTell them not to write notes rife with misspellings. And if they\u2019re too scared to deal with his messages directly, have them pass them on to someone in your department who does have thicker skin.\u201d\nWatery laughter came from the flames. \u201cYou sound like you\u2019re rather a champion of Mr. Snape, Mr. Potter.\u201d\nHarry looked evenly back into the anxious gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s about time someone was, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n*\nPounding on his door woke Harry at the hour of\u2014he squinted at the numbers hovering above his wand the instant he concentrated\u2014five in the bloody morning. He hopped out of bed and swore as he wrapped a ratty set of old robes around himself. This had better be an emergency on the order of a heart attack for Mr. Weasley or something like that.\nHe was already composing tirades at Ron in his head as he reached for the door handle when he identified the harsh, husky voice coming through the door. \u201cOpen up this instant, Potter!\u201d\nOh. shit. Snape. Harry shied back and stared at the door for a second, then raced for the bathroom and a mirror even as the pounding resumed.\nHe hastily cast the illusion spell that he and Hermione had designed to hide the soul-mark around his throat. It shimmered and fought him for a second. Hermione had said that might happen in the presence of the person whose \u201cmate\u201d he was meant to be, which was the only thing that kept Harry from panicking. He took a slow, deep breath and tried again, and this time, the mark gave a sullen gleam and disappeared from view.\nHarry walked briskly back towards the door and opened it, just in time to duck a flying fist. \u201cGood morning, sir,\u201d he said, trying to sound no more than mildly irritated. Snape being offended was better than Snape wondering why Harry sounded like he\u2019d woken up in a panic. \u201cGiven that it\u2019s five-oh-three in the morning, what do you need?\u201d\nSnape only stared at Harry with his brow furrowed for a second. His face was extremely red, but the color was already fading. Harry just stared back, wondering what in the world Snape had thought he would do. Yell, maybe?\n\u201cWhat are you wearing around your neck, Potter?\u201d\nOnce again, careful thought kept Harry from freezing. He just shrugged. \u201cA few days ago, I met with a vampire who was upset about the bill that the Wizengamot is trying to pass that would require vampires to have a wizard \u2018chaperone\u2019 when they\u2019re trying to visit Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade.\u201d And that was even the truth, although the vampire, one Lucy Bloodfang, hadn\u2019t exactly tried to rip Harry\u2019s throat open. Letting Snape infer things from the truth was better than trying to lie to a Legilimens, though.\nSnape grunted and swept through the door. \u201cAnd you\u2019re vain enough to wear an illusion even when you\u2019re asleep and alone.\u201d He abruptly turned and leaned so that he was looking through Harry\u2019s open bedroom door. \u201cYou are alone.\u201d\nHarry felt his cheeks flushing, but he shut the outer door and ignored Snape. \u201cI was trying to avoid stirring bad memories.\u201d He stared pointedly at Snape\u2019s neck, where the scars of his encounter with Nagini were still visible. That got Snape distracted, all right.\n\u201cI would hardly have come here of my own free will.\u201d Snape\u2019s folded arms and glare told the absurdity of anyone ever supposing he would. \u201cI am told that I owe my recent contract with the Ministry to your good word.\u201d\n\u201cThey contacted me to serve as a reference.\u201d\nSnape sneered at him and prowled a step closer, looking as if he was going to draw his wand any second. Harry kept a cautious eye on it. The actions of soulmates close to a marked one were unpredictable, Hermione had also told him. Snape might feel the compulsion to remove the illusion even though he didn\u2019t understand why. \u201cAnd you told me that I was perfect for the job out of guilt, of course.\u201d\nHarry snorted. \u201cHardly. I told them you would be a bastard to work with and they should have sensitive trainees give your messages to superiors up the chain instead. But I also said you would be a brilliant Potions brewer and you could experiment well and always get your assignments finished on time. What, did they pretend they were going to hire you as a favor to me or something? Because that\u2019s not how it was.\u201d\nSnape stared at him with his mouth slightly open. Harry raised his eyebrows. Maybe that made him look like his dad or something, because Snape promptly clapped his lips shut and sneered again.\n\u201cAnd you want me to shiver at your feet with gratitude.\u201d\n\u201cActually, no, I want you out of my house because you woke me up at an ungodly hour of the morning and I want to go back to sleep.\u201d\nSnape studied him carefully before he turned around and walked out. Harry relaxed, and then got his wand and cast a few spells to make sure that Snape hadn\u2019t left any nasty hexes or jinxes behind.\nNo. Huh. Harry shrugged and went back to bed. If that was a side-effect of the mark on his neck that Snape would never know about, he\u2019d take it. Just as long as coming to his door early in the morning and waking him up for no apparent reason wasn\u2019t a side-effect. Auror trainees didn\u2019t get to sleep in all that often.\n*\n\u201cYou do keep up an illusion spell on your throat at all times, don\u2019t you, Potter? I want to know why.\u201d\nHarry rolled his eyes into the depths of the small cupboard where he was hanging the special set of robes that he wore as a trainee for mock battles. \u201cJust because you want to know doesn\u2019t mean you need to, Jensen.\u201d\nHe turned around, and found Keith Jensen standing way too close to him. Harry stared at him impassively. Jensen looked a bit like Malfoy, at least in the coloring department; his eyes were a deep blue and his hair a pale gold. But his personality was nothing like. He seemed ready to worship Harry for his defeat of Voldemort, and made so many flirtatious comments Harry wasn\u2019t sure how he kept his mind on Auror business.\nBut Harry felt no trace of attraction towards him. He wasn\u2019t sure if that was the mark, or just because part of him was stubbornly determined not to be attracted to anyone who looked so much like Malfoy.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s an unusual thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jensen said in what he apparently thought was a seductive whisper. He braced a hand on the side of Harry\u2019s cupboard and leaned towards him. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you trust a mate with it?\u201d\n\u201cI have trusted a mate with it.\u201d\nJensen\u2019s face darkened a little, but he smiled and practically crowded Harry against the wall. \u201cYour Weasley and Granger don\u2019t count, Potter.\u201d\nHarry opened his mouth to tell Jensen that no one who referred to his friends in that tone of voice would ever know anything about the illusion spell on his neck, but a dark, cool voice interrupted. \u201cInciting violence among your classmates even in the Auror Corps, Trainee Potter? Whatever would your instructors think?\u201d\nHarry glanced up and blinked. Snape stood in the doorway of the storage room, his fingers drumming on the wall. He held a steaming vial of potion that Harry supposed was his excuse for being here.\nStill, it was strange. It seemed that Snape agreed with the people who had contacted Harry to serve as a reference. As far as Harry knew, he spent most of his time sending potions and messages by owls and rarely visited the Ministry.\nJensen had backed away from Harry. His face looked like whey. Harry watched him with a faint smile as he resumed putting on his normal robes. Jensen had been a Slytherin, so why he would look so terrified of his former Head of House was a mystery.\nIt reinforced Harry\u2019s beliefs about his resemblance to Malfoy, though. Both in the cowardice and the looks department.\n\u201cPro-professor,\u201d Jensen said. He swallowed. \u201cI\u2014I wasn\u2019t inciting violence in any way. Neither was Potter, actually. I was just trying to get him to answer a question.\u201d\nSnape\u2019s heavy gaze settled on Harry. \u201cIs that true, Trainee Potter?\u201d\nJensen gasped beside him, probably at the sarcastic emphasis that Snape put on what was technically Harry\u2019s proper title, but Harry only smiled. Compared to the things Snape had said to him during school, this was practically friendly. \u201cNeither of us was inciting violence in any way, sir, that\u2019s true. I simply preferred not to answer Trainee Jensen\u2019s question.\u201d\nSnape flicked another glance at Jensen. He gulped and ran away. Harry managed to hold in his laughter until he was gone. \u201cSeriously, sir, what did you do to him? Did he try to cheat on his Potions OWL or something?\u201d\n\u201cIf that had been the case, Mr. Jensen would not be standing here today,\u201d Snape said, in that dry drawl that had always made Harry unsure if he was joking or not. Then again, no, wait, Snape had never joked during Harry\u2019s tenure at Hogwarts. Snape placed the smoking potion on a shelf near the door that was technically meant to hold dirty gloves and leaned forwards. \u201cBut I find myself curious about the question.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Harry shrugged and adjusted the collar of his robe. \u201cHe wanted to know about things that weren\u2019t any of his business.\u201d\n\u201cThe illusion spell about your throat, I presume.\u201d\n\u201cYou presume correctly, sir. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014\u201d\nSnape reached out and caught his wrist as Harry attempted to press by him. Harry sighed. He was just glad that the stupid damn soul-mark wasn\u2019t wrapped around his wrist. According to Hermione, they nearly always went mad when the person they belonged to touched them. \u201cLast time, I accepted it as a matter of vanity, Mr. Potter. But it has been months since the \u2018vampire attack.\u2019 Tell me why you maintain the spell.\u201d Snape made it sound as though he had actually written the inverted commas around the words \u201cvampire attack.\u201d\nHarry gave him a bright smile. \u201cIt\u2019s less a matter of vanity than a matter of privacy, sir. And you don\u2019t have to worry that I\u2019m sneaking around behind your back at Hogwarts and getting in trouble anymore. You don\u2019t have to know about it.\u201d\nSnape\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI need to know about everything involving you, Potter.\u201d\nHarry let Snape see his sigh, although no sound left his lips. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me why, sir.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin knows what you\u2019re going to get involved in that might destroy the world at any moment.\u201d Snape tightened his hold on his wrist as Harry tugged to get his hand back. \u201cAnd I want you to dispel that illusion spell now, or I\u2019m going to assume that you have a festering sore on your neck that\u2019s host to a plague that could kill us all.\u201d\nHarry had to smile. Why had he never found Snape this funny when he was his student? Then again, being in constant detention with him and constantly compared to his father probably had something to do with that.\nAnd that only strengthened his determination to keep the mark from Snape. Snape would hate being tied like that to Harry. Even if he only felt like society would expect him to be tied, Harry couldn\u2019t do that to him.\nSo Harry told part of the truth. \u201cI woke up on my nineteenth birthday and found out a soul-mark had showed up on my neck, sir.\u201d\nSnape stared at him, his lips parted as if he was the one who was going to sigh. He never let go of Harry\u2019s wrist, though. Harry was almost sure that was the soul-mark\u2019s fault. He tugged gently on his hand.\nSnape released it at once. For some reason, he was now flushed as though someone had lit a fire under his skin.\nHarry shrugged. Probably one more side-effect of the mark. \u201cI found out that it referred to someone who I can\u2014never be with. I didn\u2019t want people gaping at it or deciding it referred to them or pitying me if they figured out the truth, too. I want to keep it hidden.\u201d\nSnape swallowed several times before he spoke, his voice unexpectedly rough. \u201cSoul-marks are rare and precious, Potter. I am sorry that yours is a cause of more pain than it is honor.\u201d\nHarry stared at him, then nodded. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d It seemed that Snape was one of those people Hermione had told him about who really did think of soul-marks as the best thing that could possibly happen to you.\nCome to think of it, that was probably why he\u2019d blushed when he realized that he was holding Harry\u2019s hand. Those rather traditional people who thought soul-marks a blessing also thought that you shouldn\u2019t touch the bare skin of someone marked as another person\u2019s\u2014\nProperty, Harry thought wearily, and walked through the door that Snape held open for him. Snape kept watching him all the way down the corridor. It made the soul-mark burn and itch, and Harry reminded himself, again and again, why he was better off hiding the bloody thing.\nSnape might respect the idea in the abstract, but it was rather different as a net he could never slip out of.\n*\nHarry had thought the address sounded familiar with Auror Forman burst into the training rooms shouting for instructors and trainees and anyone else who had legs and ears and Apparating ability to follow her. And it made sense that it would be an emergency but not a huge one. Most of the regular, trained Aurors were out on other cases. This had to be something trainees and teachers on desk duty could cope with.\nOnly when he came out of the Side-Along did he realize they were on a quiet little street outside Hogsmeade, and that the burning house in front of him was\u2014\nSnape\u2019s Potions lab.\nHarry promptly broke into motion, ignoring the shouts from behind him, and the orders that were telling him to do something different. The mark was humming like an agitated insect on his neck. He knew without asking that it would guide him towards his soulmate, and that it meant Snape was in danger.\nA broken window loomed in front of him. Harry leaped, tucked into a sphere that shattered more of the glass. Shards scraped his sides, but he ignored them, dropping immediately to the floor once he was inside the house.\nSmoke billowed past him. Harry cast a charm that would purify the air as it came into contact with his nostrils and mouth, and another one that forced the smoke off to the sides so he could see. Then he drew as strong a breath as he could and bellowed, \u201cSnape!\u201d\nA faint sound came from off to the left. Harry promptly clawed his way towards it, moving on his knees and hands no matter how much he wanted to stand up. His little Purifying Charm would be overwhelmed in seconds if he got his head into that smoke, especially since it was tainted with purple and green.\nSomewhere, Snape\u2019s potions were burning, too, and releasing probably poisonous fumes into the air.\nHarry managed to get into the small side-room that looked like it contained most of Snape\u2019s finished potions. The walls were stone and not burning\u2014yet\u2014but the tables were all on fire, and so were the storage cupboards, and the glass vials had enormous, randomly-colored flames shooting out of them. Snape, his face wrapped in what looked like a version of the Bubble-Head Charm, was trying to rescue a huge stack of flasks.\nHarry whipped his wand forwards and floated the flasks into the air. Snape turned and snarled at him.\n\u201cSir! Come on!\u201d\n\u201cThese represent years of experimental work!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring them!\u201d Harry held out his hand, making sure that his sleeve dangled enough so that Snape could grab cloth instead of flesh. Snape would probably refuse to touch, as he thought, the skin of someone else\u2019s soulmate, and get them both burned in the process. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any time!\u201d\nSnape grimaced and crawled rapidly towards him, seizing his hand. Harry sighed in relief and drew him along. All in all, this fire wasn\u2019t as dangerous as it could have been. Magic would prevent the worst of the damage, and\u2014\nAhead of them, a warning roar meant the roof was about to fall in.\nHarry didn\u2019t even think. He flung himself sideways so that his arms were wrapped around Snape and his foot was touching the collection of floating flasks and Apparated.\nThey appeared in the alley outside the Ministry entrance. Snape sat up at once, his face wrinkling into another snarl, but Harry managed to pull back from him and point to the collection of flasks that were still floating a good few inches above the ground. \u201cSee? Everything is fine.\u201d\nSnape stared at him, then at the flasks, and then back at him. He said not a word. Shock probably, Harry thought. He needed to get Snape to St. Mungo\u2019s, or at least to some place that the Healers could look at him. Harry stood and brushed some dust off his robes.\n\u201cHow are you alive?\u201d Snape whispered.\nThat startled a laugh out of Harry. \u201cThe same way I got through all my years at Hogwarts, sir. Good luck and good reflexes.\u201d He summoned his Patronus by concentrating on the fact that Snape and all his work had survived, and smiled when the stag appeared in front of him. \u201cGo to St. Mungo\u2019s and tell them that I\u2019m bringing in a wizard that needs to be treated for smoke inhalation and the effect of burning Potions ingredients.\u201d\nProngs lowered his antlers once before bounding away. Harry bent down and carefully took only Snape\u2019s sleeve as he urged him to his feet. \u201cCome on. I don\u2019t know for sure what the fumes of all those burning ingredients combined with the smoke would do to you, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cMy collection.\u201d\n\u201cI can put them in my office and keep them safe that way, sir. That is, if you\u2019ll trust me with them.\u201d\nSnape only studied him for long moments, long enough that Harry wondered if he was going to act uncomfortable again about someone else\u2019s soulmate touching him. Then he nodded slowly. \u201cI will trust you.\u201d\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Harry conjured a stretcher and carefully slid it beneath the floating flasks, then canceled the charm that had kept them in the air. When they sagged and Snape took a step forwards, Harry shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s only to get them there safely. I\u2019ll fly them to my office.\u201d\n\u201cWhile escorting me to St. Mungo\u2019s at the same time?\u201d\n\u201cAd casam,\u201d Harry told the stretcher, rolling his eyes a little as it took off and Snape stared after it. \u201cA charm I developed. It\u2019ll take the potions directly to the office, and nothing will happen to them there. My door only opens for objects like this or my personal touch, and then locks behind them.\u201d\nSnape was quiet as Harry herded him towards a more usual Apparition point. Then he said, so softly Harry could scarcely hear him, \u201cWhoever would refuse to be your soulmate must know only your public reputation.\u201d\nHarry shook his head, not liking to hear Snape put himself down. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that,\u201d he responded.\nJust before they Apparated, he thought he heard Snape say, \u201cIsn\u2019t it always?\u201d\nBut this situation really is complicated, Harry thought as he sat on a bed in the same ward as Snape and watched the Healers treat him for the effect of smoke and fume inhalation. The Healers hadn\u2019t been about to let Harry escape until he underwent the same treatment. He would hate me so much if he knew how he\u2019d be trapped.\nAnd avoiding Snape\u2019s hatred was something that had become\u2026important for Harry.\n\u201cSo, as you can see, esteemed members of the Wizengamot, there is no evidence proving that my clients were actually involved in the burning of the potions lab of notorious Death Eater Severus Snape.\u201d\nHarry sneered a little as he watched the smug barrister standing in front of the Wizengamot. He was a man Harry had dealt with before, named Arnold Puffevin. Harry wouldn\u2019t have despised him so much if he hadn\u2019t made a point of representing only pure-bloods and curling his lip about everyone else.\nAnd if he didn\u2019t keep bringing up Snape\u2019s Death Eater status, as if that had been the case for more than twenty years.\n\u201cWell, you certainly present an interesting case, Mr. Puffevin,\u201d said one of the simpering members of the Wizengamot whom Harry despised for much the same reasons as he despised the barrister. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose the prosecution has another witness to call?\u201d\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, we do, Madam Smythe-Blyton. May I present Auror Trainee Harry Potter?\u201d\nGasps and unhappy murmurs swept the room for a moment, along with the clicks of cameras. Harry ignored the reporters and walked into the light from the small chair in the shadows that he\u2019d taken earlier on. Puffevin\u2019s face tightened when he saw Harry, but his smile remained pleasant.\n\u201cI fail to see what evidence Trainee Potter could present that has not already been presented, Ms. Bones.\u201d\nSusan Bones smiled a little. If Puffevin had had any sense, Harry thought, he would have feared that smile, coming from a witch who had already completed the intense training necessary for a Ministry barrister and was already winning her cases. But he didn\u2019t, so Susan just shook her head a little and said, \u201cTrainee Potter was actually in the fire while it was burning, and was treated afterwards for smoke and fume inhalation at St. Mungo\u2019s, along with former Professor Snape. It was the treatment that brought up an interesting issue.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Harry said, in his best imitation of Snape\u2019s drawl, which made Puffevin jump, Susan look at him with a softer, more knowing smile, and Snape probably scowl behind him. \u201cYou see, one of the poisonous fumes that the Healers had to treat me for turned out to be the smoke of burning blueshade. Deadly in small amounts, not useful for most potions, so Mr. Snape didn\u2019t have any in his stores. But, of course, the Aurors who arrested your clients found their hands covered in the dust. One has to conclude\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou planted that evidence!\u201d\nHarry turned his head, his eyebrows rising a little. This is a turn of events I didn\u2019t anticipate. One of the clients Puffevin was representing, Yolanda Jacobs, had leaped to her feet after not saying anything during the trial, and was pointing at Harry with a trembling hand.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s evidence of that at all, Ms. Jacobs,\u201d Harry said, politely but firmly. \u201cIf you wish to dispute that, then you will have to present\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t try to murder Snape! We hate him, but we didn\u2019t try to murder him!\u201d Jacobs looked around, but any sympathetic members of her audience didn\u2019t care to identify themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to say that we did! And I think this farce of a trial has gone on long enough,\u201d she continued, voice firming as though she thought no one had interrupted her because she was stunning them with her genius.\nHarry waited for a second, but Puffevin was too busy trying to stare his client to death to respond. \u201cThere is also the recognition of Mr. Gorman by the apothecary who sold him the blueshade,\u201d he continued smoothly. \u201cIt might not have been relevant, but after the evidence of blueshade inhalation found by the Healers of St. Mungo\u2019s, the Aurors looked into the records of apothecaries that had recently sold it. In addition, we have a witness who spied both Mr. Gorman and Ms. Jacobs near the site of the fire.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t attempted murder!\u201d\nHarry cast a glance at Jacobs, and then at Hector Gorman. The man, a cousin of Jacobs, was sitting with his hands tucked between his knees and a carefully blank expression on his face.\nHmm. What she says could still be true if they didn\u2019t tell her they were going to murder Snape.\n\u201cI do have a question for Mr. Snape,\u201d Puffevin snapped suddenly, before the Wizengamot could ask to speak to the apothecary or the other witness. \u201cI understand that you came out of the fire almost unharmed, with a large collection of experimental potions with you. How did you manage to escape if you were suffering from blueshade inhalation in the middle of the fire?\u201d\nSnape turned his head a little and studied the Wizengamot. \u201cPermission to answer the honorable barrister\u2019s question?\u201d\nGod, his control, Harry thought in admiration. He\u2019d learned how to hold back his temper and follow Auror reporting structures in a lot of instances, but he didn\u2019t know if he could have been so calm when someone accused him of trying to stage his own murder.\nIt made him wonder what other circumstances Snape could demonstrate that control in, but he shook off the thought as Minister Shacklebolt nodded. \u201cYes, you may speak, if Ms. Bones thinks it advisable.\u201d\nSusan spent a moment examining Snape as if she questioned his control, but then nodded. Snape stood and faced Puffevin. \u201cI survived and took the potions with me because of Auror Trainee Potter\u2019s actions.\u201d\nHarry felt as if fire was trying to eat his face from the inside. He had not known Snape was going to say that!\nPuffevin frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d Susan just looked smug, rubbing her nails on her robes and studying Puffevin.\n\u201cAuror Trainee Potter came to rescue me, running into the building despite its burning state,\u201d Snape said. His back was turned to Harry, so he might not be aware of the fact that Harry was blushing like a maiden. Thank Merlin for small mercies. \u201cWhen I refused to leave without my experimental potions, Auror Potter Levitated them, and then ensured that he was touching both me and them when he Apparated us.\u201d\n\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t have been possible, either,\u201d Puffevin said quickly. \u201cI understand there were wards preventing Apparition around your shop.\u201d\n\u201cAuror Trainee Potter tore through them. He is\u2014quite powerful.\u201d\nSnape turned his head then, and Harry made himself meet the man\u2019s eyes. They had a depth of warmth for a second before Snape covered it. Harry was frankly relieved. It would make Snape\u2019s case harder to support if people thought he was biased for Harry.\nAlso, and this was no one\u2019s business but Harry, seeing emotions like that in Snape\u2019s eyes made the mark on his neck itch and burn.\n\u201cPermission to call another Auror who can testify to the state of the wards on Mr. Snape\u2019s shop?\u201d Susan asked, turning to face the Wizengamot.\nShe received it, and other Aurors testified to the wards being torn, Harry\u2019s \u201csuicidal\u201d charge into the building, and to the fact that they had seen Harry remove Snape\u2019s experimental potions from his office later. Healers from St. Mungo\u2019s also testified to the blueshade inhalation both Snape and Harry had suffered. Snape didn\u2019t have to say anything else as Susan skillfully made her arguments for what the penalty should be and deflected Puffevin\u2019s inept questioning of the witnesses.\nOf course, he didn\u2019t have to sit in his chair and watch Harry, either. But that was exactly what he did.\nHarry felt as if he was standing in sunlight.\n*\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure why you wanted me to come.\u201d\nHarry hoped he didn\u2019t sound as embarrassed as he felt, but, well, it was strange to be standing in the doorway of what was apparently a new lab Snape had set up. This one had an entrance that looked like a cave and so many protective spells around it that it was hard for Harry to breathe.\n\u201cI thought you should have the chance to see the new environment of the potions that you rescued from extinction,\u201d Snape said over his shoulder. He was placing flasks and vials and what looks like glasses and mugs and cups of ingredients on new stands and in new drawers.\nHarry laughed, and watched as Snape tilted his head down a little in acknowledgement of that laugh. His fingers flickered and danced like insects\u2019 wings. Harry followed them with his eyes for a second before he looked away.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to feel that you owed me anything,\u201d Harry said to the walls. \u201cI mean, not another life-debt or something like that. I saved you because I wanted to.\u201d\nSnape was silent, but there were no more clinking sounds, either. Harry looked at him and found Snape frowning at him over his shoulder.\n\u201cI know you did. And what I feel that I owe you is my own.\u201d\nHarry nodded awkwardly. Then, because Snape had turned back to stocking his new cabinets but also hadn\u2019t dismissed him, he stuck his hands in his robe pockets and started wandering around the room.\nIt was enormous, nearly a cavern, and mostly located underground other than a small section that was being sprayed with sunlight through a window. Harry suspected there were some ingredients that needed natural light. The wall was made of joined squares of flagstone, and the walls were spotlessly clean, probably Transfigured from earth. Harry touched a sleek marble table next to him and imagined it covered with bubbling cauldrons.\n\u201cWhere did you find this place?\u201d he asked Snape.\n\u201cIt belonged to Mr. Gorman, my would-be assassin.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Harry turned around to stare at him. \u201cDid he give it to you in exchange for a reduction in his sentence or something?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Snape smiled, a faint press of his lips. \u201cThere were other charges I could have pressed against him. I chose not to press them. In return, he offered this to me for a substantially reduced press.\u201d\n\u201cHey, good for you.\u201d\nSnape paused for a second, his eyes sliding sideways to Harry. \u201cThe embodiment of law and justice is praising my underhanded negotiation tactics?\u201d\nHarry shook his head. \u201cI was never that. I got into too much trouble as a student. And you didn\u2019t do anything that put anybody else in danger. That means, as an Auror, I officially don\u2019t have to care about it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd do other Aurors feel the same way as you do?\u201d\nHarry tried not to close his eyes or betray himself with a shiver. Damn, Snape sounded\u2014deep when he talked like that. Deep was the only adjective that Harry would let himself think of.\n\u201cNot all of them,\u201d Harry chose to say instead, turning to the side to examine the cupboard where Snape had stacked some of the cauldrons, and what looked like kegs of butterbeer. Harry suspected it wasn\u2019t, but then, for all he knew, maybe butterbeer was actually useful in some potions. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell them.\u201d\n\u201cI do appreciate that, Harry.\u201d\nHarry swallowed and decided not to comment on the fact that Snape had given himself permission to use Harry\u2019s first name. No matter how much things might have changed, there was still the fact that Snape had been bound by two masters and wouldn\u2019t want to see the stupid brand on Harry\u2019s neck.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Snape said, facing Harry at last with one vial in his fingers, which he considered against the light and then discarded, presumably because of some flaw too small for Harry to see. \u201cLunch?\u201d\n*\n\u201cI wanted to speak to you, Auror Trainee Potter. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and I appreciate the tea, sir. But we\u2019ve also been in this office for twenty minutes without you saying why you wanted to speak to me.\u201d\nDawlish fussed with the edge of the teacup and frowned at his papers. Harry looked away from him and tried to read the titles on the bookshelves behind Dawlish. He tried to do that every time he was in the Head Auror\u2019s office, and so far, he still hadn\u2019t managed to read all of them. It might be his poor eyesight, or it might be the way that the books genuinely seemed to shuffle and shift around.\n\u201cSome of your peers have suggested that you might be compromised,\u201d Dawlish finally choked out.\nHarry turned to him in true astonishment. \u201cReally? Why? I was excused for the curses I cast during the war.\u201d There had been some people who hadn\u2019t wanted to do that, but then again, they would have had to investigate every use of illegal curses in the war, Unforgivable or not, and no one wanted to open that sack of Kneazles.\n\u201cBecause of your closeness to Severus Snape.\u201d\nHarry rolled his eyes. \u201cSo they think he might still be a Death Eater and I wouldn\u2019t do my duty if called upon to investigate him? But then the Ministry shouldn\u2019t be employing him as a brewer at all, should they?\u201d\n\u201cHe works here?\u201d\n\u201cYes, he does.\u201d Harry managed not to roll his eyes again; it was a near thing. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know that, sir?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Dawlish dug for a moment and came up with a file. Then he read a few pages and frowned while Harry tried not to swing his legs. \u201cSays here that you recommended him.\u201d His eyes darted back to Harry, suspicious.\n\u201cThe Ministry themselves called me and asked me to be a reference for him. Maybe they expected a negative one, but I told them the truth about his brewing skills and they hired him.\u201d Harry stared back impassively. \u201cIs there going to be an accusation at the end of this, sir? And what for?\u201d\n\u201cWell, as a matter of fact, another Auror trainee has suggested that you may not have the clearest mind when it comes to Mr. Snape. Trainee Jensen said that he\u2019s seen interactions between the two of you that imply a personal relationship. That\u2019s the sort of thing you should have admitted at the trial, Trainee Potter.\u201d\nHarry let himself lean all the way back and laugh. \u201cThen I know exactly where this accusation is coming from, sir. Trainee Jensen wanted a personal relationship with me. I rebuffed him because I have a soul-mark.\u201d\nDawlish let his jaw droop a bit. \u201cThat explains the illusion spell on your neck.\u201d\nHarry looked down a little. \u201cYes, sir. And it\u2019s someone who\u2019s absolutely unattainable due to the war. I want to keep it private.\u201d\n\u201cI can see why you would. So what happened? Trainee Jensen didn\u2019t respect that you only wanted a relationship with your soulmate?\u201d\nHarry enjoyed, without guilt, the sight of Dawlish looking as if he\u2019d like to discipline Jensen. \u201cYes. And Mr. Snape happened to be nearby, on a trip to the Ministry, when Trainee Jensen pushed the issue. Mr. Snape himself deeply respects soul-marks. He told Jensen to leave me be.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Trainee Jensen mentioned none of this. I will of course be speaking with him.\u201d Dawlish made a note on a piece of parchment in front of him.\n\u201cThank you, sir. Will that be all?\u201d\n\u201cIt will, Auror Trainee Potter. Though, one piece of advice. And I don\u2019t want to advise you how to conduct your dating life\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSir.\u201d\n\u201cBut if your soulmate is still alive and not in Azkaban, might I suggest approaching her? Soul-marks are rare enough that it\u2019s not only people of my generation or Mr. Snape\u2019s who admire them. She might be won over faster than you\u2019d think if you reveal it to her and explain that you bear it, and you\u2019ve waited for her.\u201d\nHarry half-smiled, appreciating the support at the same time as he saw everything that Dawlish had wrong in that statement. The gender was just to start with. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it, sir. Is there anything else you needed to know about my connection with Mr. Snape?\u201d\n\u201cNo. In fact, I think I\u2019ll be asking Trainee Jensen to attend me the minute we\u2019re done speaking here. Of all the disgraceful things, getting upset because someone with a soul-mark refuses to date you\u2026\u201d\nHarry nodded to the Head Auror and walked out the door of the office again, his head bent a little and his eyes closed. God, if only the situation was as simple as Dawlish thought and he just had to convince a Voldemort supporter or someone who\u2019d betrayed him that they should be together.\nInstead of never being able to approach a man he was increasingly coming to care for without ending his freedom.\n*\n\u201cSeriously, Harry. You know how he feels about soul-marks now, and you didn\u2019t even have to ask him! Just tell him!\u201d\n\u201cLook, mate, I think you should. I mean, yeah,\u201d Ron had added in response to the way Harry raised his eyebrows, \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with it and it\u2019s going to take me a long time to get comfortable, but that\u2019s my problem. You deserve to be happy. Soul-marks are rare things, and you\u2019ve got close to Snape anyway without even telling him. What\u2019s the worst that can happen when you reveal it?\u201d\n\nThat the joy leaves his eyes. \n\nAnd that, Harry couldn\u2019t bear. He could have borne it if Snape was angry because Harry had lied to him\u2014if only by omission\u2014or if Snape had seen the mark and said that, all things considered, they were better off in the strange friendship they\u2019d fallen into. But he would suffer far more than he did now if he snuffed out the joy Snape had barely begun to believe he could have.\nSnape would accept the soul-mark as a duty, especially if he respected them. But Harry wanted to be held and comforted in love.\nThat, or nothing.\nSo he said nothing, even though his friends continued to urge him, even though Dawlish would give his disguised neck a disapproving look every time they met in the Ministry, and even though Snape\u2019s eyes had come to linger on it with a deepening curiosity.\nIf he loved Snape\u2026\nIf he could love Snape, Harry had added to himself hastily. He knew he wouldn\u2019t dare describe his feelings as love just yet.\nIf he could, keeping him free and happy was worth more than snatching at some selfish happiness that wouldn\u2019t be like he was envisioning anyway.\n*\n\u201cEnough is enough.\u201d\nHarry looked up in surprise as Snape put his wineglass heavily down on the table. They were at an Italian restaurant in the Muggle world, and Harry had noticed when they walked in how dim the lighting was, how soft and romantic the music, and how whispery the Italian words that were mingled in with the music for no apparent reason. He wouldn\u2019t have brought them here, but it had been Snape\u2019s choice.\nAnd now Snape was glaring at him in a way that made Harry\u2019s heartbeat pick up. He sighed. He knew very well that that flood of adrenaline wasn\u2019t related to fear.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s enough?\u201d Harry sipped his wine and looked around for distraction. It didn\u2019t help. The people sitting at the tables nearest them were all couples, holding hands or grinning at each other like fools. A little further away with a solitary woman, who cradled her head in her hands and regularly blew her nose into a handkerchief.\n\u201cYou have carried that soul-mark on your neck for at least two years, am I correct?\u201d Snape\u2019s voice was hard and precise. \u201cSince your nineteenth birthday.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Harry frowned a little, toying with his wineglass. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\u201cHave you made any effort to approach this person?\u201d\n\u201cI already told you, they\u2019re out of reach due to the war\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt is not like you to be a bloody coward, Potter.\u201d Snape\u2019s voice roughened, lowered. \u201cUnless they were dead, which you have not spoken of, I would have expected you to at least ask. There are people who might have hated you during the war and who would still be honored to know you were marked as theirs. You do not understand how often soul-marks are respected by our kind.\u201d\n\u201cNo, because no one bothered to bloody explain it to me,\u201d Harry snapped, hoping to start an argument that would get him out of the one Snape was trying to start.\nSnape didn\u2019t follow his lead. \u201cBecause they are rare and not something that is part of the ordinary life experienced by most wizards,\u201d he snapped back, leaning in. \u201cThere is no need to explain it in detail to children who may never have one or be part of a bond. But you\u2026you are the only one I know who has received this gift and not at least tried to pursue it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\u201cNo more impossible than your saving my life and my not resenting you for it. Go, Potter,\u201d Snape said, and stood up abruptly. \u201cFind your soulmate. Try to at least convince her that you would spend your life with her and that the war need not stand between you forever.\u201d\n\u201cThat shows how much you know,\u201d Harry said before he could stop himself. \u201cIt\u2019s a him.\u201d\nSnape paused. Then he turned back around. \u201cAnd what holds you back, then? Childish fear that the wizarding world would disapprove of you for having a male lover? Fears of your own, that you are less than straight?\u201d\n\u201cI already told you it had to do with the war.\u201d\n\u201cI want to know who it is.\u201d\nHarry hissed in astonishment before he could stop himself. The books he\u2019d found had been pretty clear. It was the height of bad manners to ask about a soul-mark that someone had chosen to hide\u2014which they did, sometimes, if the person they were soulmated to was already married or infamous or otherwise unsuitable. Someone who had been gifted with a soul-mark was already special enough, without being pressured to disclose it.\n\u201cI want to know.\u201d Snape\u2019s face was closed. \u201cIs it the Dark Lord?\u201d\n\u201cAre you insane?\u201d\n\u201cYou did not answer the question.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not! And not Fenrir Greyback or Albus Dumbledore or Rabastan Lestrange, either, before you can ask about that.\u201d\nSnape\u2019s posture softened enough that a laugh huffed out of his mouth. \u201cThen I don\u2019t understand why you would have such reluctance to reveal it. Someone who is separated from you by the war\u2026It cannot be a Weasley whose marriage you are reluctant to disrupt, then, which would have been my second guess.\u201d He curled his fingers into the edge of the table and then sat back down, probably because he was attracting attention. \u201cDo you not trust me enough to tell me?\u201d\n\u201cThere are reasons I can\u2019t.\u201d Harry swallowed the last of his wine, and stood himself with a soft ache in his chest. This would probably be the last of his friendly outings with Snape. Honestly, he should have cut them off a while ago. It was getting close to him under false pretenses, to chat and let Snape call him by his first name and be his friend when he was carrying the man\u2019s soul-mark on his throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. If I could tell you those reasons, you would understand.\u201d\n\u201cBut you have not told me, and I do not understand.\u201d Snape was smiling, but there was an edge like a sliver of broken mirror to it. \u201cTell me, Harry.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Harry put enough money to pay for his meal on the table and turned away.\n\u201cPotter.\u201d\nPart of him winced; it was a really bad sign that Snape was calling him that, when he had called Harry by his first name for months. But on the other hand, Harry didn\u2019t call him \u201cSeverus,\u201d did he? Everything about the relationship they had was, in the end, not as open and free and frank as it needed to be.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry repeated. He walked out of the restaurant without looking back.\nHe intended to find a darkened alley that he could use as an Apparition point. What he hadn\u2019t counted on was finding that alley only to have his arms gripped and his back almost slammed against the wall.\n\u201cTell me,\u201d Snape snarled, leaning down right into his face.\n\u201cNo\u2014\u201d\nHarry started to kick out, but then he realized that most of what was going on had been a distraction. Snape had already got his wand into place and aimed it, muttering, \u201cFinite Incantatem,\u201d under his breath.\nHarry closed his eyes as he felt the illusion spell above his mark dissolve. For a moment, he hoped Snape couldn\u2019t see it in the darkness, but they weren\u2019t far from the lights of Muggle restaurants and shops, and the alley was dim, not black.\nSnape\u2019s breathing stopped completely.\n\u201cI said you wouldn\u2019t understand,\u201d Harry said softly as Snape\u2019s hands fell limply away from his arms. His chest hurt more than ever. He wondered if Snape would think that Harry saving his life and going to meals with him and arguing, as they had done, about Ministry policy was just a deception to get close to him. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\nHis eyes flew open as the grip was renewed, and Snape leaned right into his face and said, \u201cWe are going to go back to your home and we are going to talk, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cDid you ever intend to tell me?\u201d\nSnape had asked the question before Harry could even close the door behind him. Harry gritted his teeth and shut the door, then kicked off his boots and walked into the kitchen, reaching for the cabinet where he kept his liquor.\nSnape\u2019s hand closed on his wrist and turned him around. He sure doesn\u2019t mind touching me now that he can see his soul-mark on me. The thought darted through Harry\u2019s head and gave him some clarity.\nWhether or not he\u2019d wanted it to happen, Snape knew about the soul-mark now. That meant he had to handle it.\nHe stared into the man\u2019s eyes and admitted, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cSo. These reasons that I wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d Snape abruptly removed his hands and leaned back on the counter opposite the one Harry stood by, as if he was calm. Harry could look into his eyes, the darkness of them, and escape that delusion. \u201cI would like them explained to me soon.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Harry matched the calm tone as best he could. This was the last time he would stand with Snape like this. \u201cWould you care for some Firewhisky?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I would care for some conversation.\u201d\nHarry swallowed, and nodded, turning away from the liquor cabinet. \u201cThen we can go into the drawing room.\u201d\nSnape kept looking around even when he was seated in the most comfortable chair, the green one in front of the fire, as if he hadn\u2019t already seen it the day he came to confront Harry about the Ministry reference. Harry clasped his hands on the arms of the chair and just watched him. He wondered why he hadn\u2019t noticed how necessary Snape\u2019s company had become to him.\nPerhaps better that he only noticed it now, though, right before he lost it. He would have had to spend years anticipating the loss otherwise.\n\u201cNow.\u201d Snape faced him again. \u201cWhy would you not inform me of your mark, especially once you knew how I felt about soul-marks?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you had literally carried a brand on your skin for years,\u201d Harry replied softly, his eyes going to Snape\u2019s left arm, \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine you would want to be bound to someone else. Vows and necessity and the Dark Mark\u2026you just had your freedom back completely when I found out about this mark. How could I use it to enslave you?\u201d\nSnape gave him an absolutely befuddled stare. Harry stared back. Maybe Snape felt differently now, but that was only because he had months of calm interaction with Harry behind him. Harry was still sure Snape would have felt like that if Harry had gone to him and told him about the soul-mark the instant he\u2019d found it.\n\u201cYou are mistaken,\u201d Snape said at last.\n\u201cBut bound to me?\u201d Harry shook his head. \u201cI know about the Vow that Dumbledore put you under to protect me. And of course I was part of that prophecy that helped ruin your life, too.\u201d He took a deep breath, and let it out slowly. He would start pleading with Snape to understand if he went on this way. He had to let it be Snape\u2019s free choice. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine the resentment you would feel.\n\u201cThat only got worse when I found out how rare soul-marks were. How could I bind you like that? How could you accept a soul-mark tying you to the son of a man you hated?\u201d\nSnape leaned forwards a little. \u201cIt is a long time since I have hated you.\u201d\n\u201cBut when this first showed up, that wasn\u2019t true. And when I started realizing that maybe you were my friend, all I could think was that I would end up destroying the life that you finally had if I ever said anything.\u201d\n\u201cI think it may be simpler than that.\u201d\nHarry narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat might be simpler than that?\u201d He\u2019d told Snape the truth. It wasn\u2019t his fault if the man decided to completely ignore him, but it did sting a little.\n\u201cI think that perhaps you achieved something that you did not expect, not with the manner of man you believed I was.\u201d Snape had focused so entirely on Harry it was as if they were back at the trial for the idiots who had burned down Snape\u2019s lab. \u201cYou achieved a measure of peace, of freedom, of friendship, and you could not see yourself risking that for an uncertain reward.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re calling me a coward, right?\u201d\n\u201cIn certain respects, I believe you are.\u201d\nHarry stiffened his shoulders. Don\u2019t let on how much this hurts, don\u2019t let on. It\u2019s better if he walks away because you\u2019re a coward than feels trapped later. \u201cThen why would you want to be with someone like me?\u201d\n\u201cBecause certain respects is not all,\u201d Snape said, and his face changed in an odd way. It wasn\u2019t a smile, it wasn\u2019t a smirk, but it was somewhere in between them, shining more from his eyes than lips. \u201cAnd in some of those respects, you were indeed wise to wait. Now I cannot imagine being apart from you.\u201d\nHarry swallowed. Or tried. His throat was so dry he didn\u2019t manage. Snape should have let me have that Firewhisky, he decided randomly.\n\u201cI had grown increasingly jealous of the woman that I believed possessed your devotion despite being on the opposite side of the war. But despite that, I could not imagine trying to break a soul-mark bond. I came to the restaurant tonight intending to urge you to try and find a way to her.\u201d\n\u201cYou just assumed I would be attracted to the person my mark pointed to? In love with them?\u201d\nSnape paused a moment, then said in a gentler voice, \u201cForgive me. I almost always forget now that you weren\u2019t raised in our world and don\u2019t realize how sacred a soul-mark bond is held to be. It\u2019s not that you would have to be attracted to\u2014whoever your mark referred to.\u201d He swallowed, and held out a hand slowly, as though assuming he would scare Harry off. Harry let the hand rest on his knee, still looking at Snape.\n\u201cIt\u2019s that a soul-mark is so great an honor,\u201d Snape continued in a low tone, \u201cthat the person whose mark you bore would be assumed to be attracted. Honored. Interested in getting to know you and overcoming whatever obstacles lay between you.\u201d\n\u201cSo you were urging me to find this person\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBecause I thought this nonexistent other person would make you happy by striving to make you happy, yes. Instead,\u201d and Snape\u2019s fingers moved, caressing Harry\u2019s knee and making him close his eyes with a shiver, \u201cI find that you have been thinking of me. Is that why you defended me and gave me your reference and became my friend?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Harry forced his eyes open. \u201cI would have stood up for you anyway. But the mark did start me thinking in terms of what you\u2019d experienced and made me more open to exploring things.\u201d\n\u201cThat, I think, is what they are meant to do.\u201d Snape breathed slowly out. \u201cAnd your interest in me kindled mine in you.\u201d\nHarry touched Snape\u2019s hand back, running his finger slowly down the side and watching Snape shiver the way he had. \u201cSo you\u2019re interested in getting to know me even though you thought I was a coward?\u201d\n\u201cI think I do know you much better.\u201d Snape\u2019s voice was sinking, so much so that Harry had to lean closer and closer to hear. \u201cWould you\u2014be interested in continuing that theme?\u201d\nHarry swallowed. This time, it was possible. Perhaps hope eased the way. \u201cYes. Please.\u201d And he tried something he hadn\u2019t even tried in his thoughts before, not thinking he had a right to do it. \u201cSeverus.\u201d\nSeverus stood up and moved around the chair. Harry tilted his head back, and Severus bent down to kiss him. The brush of his lips was gentle at first, but his hand also moved, fingers falling against the soul-mark on Harry\u2019s throat at the same time.\nHarry gave a startled gasp. The warm sensation that spiraled away from the mark had two parts. One dived to his groin in a wave of pure pleasure. The other rose up to his brain and made him fall into a memory of spending time with Severus as though he was living it again\u2014a meal several weeks ago where they had disagreed on whether Muggleborns should know about magic before their Hogwarts letters arrived. Warmth, and the taste of good food on his tongue, and the way Severus\u2019s eyes lingered on him.\nHe recalled, vaguely, Hermione saying something about what happened when a soulmate touched the soul-mark, but he had never known it would be this intense. He looked up at Severus as he came out of the memory.\nThe eyes he met now were no less warm than the ones in his memory.\n\u201cCome with me, if you will,\u201d Severus said, and held out his hand.\nIt felt like accepting several futures at once as Harry stood up and reached out for it.\n*\nSeverus cast several Freshening and Dust-Removing Charms when they came into the bedroom. Harry bristled a little. \u201cIt\u2019s only because I\u2019ve been busy with Auror training.\u201d\nWell, that and trying to decide if it was worth spending time around Severus when he knew he would never get what he wanted, what the soul-mark seemed to promise.\n\u201cYou will have more time for them later, perhaps,\u201d Severus said, and tossed his wand on the table beside the bed. When he turned around again, his eyes had gone from warm to scorching, and hungry. Harry shivered and began unbuttoning the shirt he had chosen to venture into Muggle London.\n\u201cYes, I thought so,\u201d Severus said, which didn\u2019t make much sense, and came over to kiss him.\nHis mouth was still soft, dark, hot. Harry pushed Severus gently back against the bedroom wall, taking his turn this time. Severus opened his mouth and let him have control. Harry was shivering convulsively by the time he undid the robes. Severus had simply hidden his clothes from the Muggles with an illusion charm.\n\u201cHave you done this before?\u201d Severus exhaled against his mouth.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Harry had decided that he could do worse than jump off a cliff of complete honesty. \u201cIs that going to be a problem?\u201d\n\u201cIt means I will go a little more slowly.\u201d Severus\u2019s hands tightened for a moment on his arms, and then he helped Harry get his robes off, and Harry shrug his shirt off. Harry gasped as their bare chests pressed against each other. He could feel ropy scars, but the falling and rising skin underneath his, the soft breaths Severus let fall over his lips, and the beating heart meant more to him.\nThe scars had happened. But Severus was alive, and had come through.\n\u201cLie down on the bed so I can undress you,\u201d Severus said. His voice had turned into a harsh pant between one breath and another, it seemed.\n\u201cSir,\u201d Harry said, mocking, but Severus didn\u2019t react other than one annoyed flicker of an eyelid. He was too busy staring at Harry\u2019s erection under his trousers as if he had envisioned it before but never thought it would look so good. That sent a rush of flattery to Harry\u2019s head so strong that he barely managed to get on the bed before he started undressing himself.\n\u201cI said I would do that.\u201d Severus\u2019s voice had the ability to descend to an erotic rumble when he let it. Harry gasped before he could stop himself. This was something he had only heard hints of before, in their conversations over lunch and dinner and bubbling cauldrons.\nSeverus gave him a faint smile and reached down to undo Harry\u2019s trousers and then slide off his pants and socks. Harry knew he was flushed all the way to the tip of his cock. He just hoped that Severus liked what he saw, not only the soul-mark around Harry\u2019s neck.\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d Severus said, and reached down to flick Harry\u2019s shaft on the head. Harry hissed between his teeth. Severus flicked him one more time and then reached out to stroke him. He seemed to alternate his gaze between Harry\u2019s face and his throat.\nAnd that wasn\u2019t fair, that he was already giving Harry a wank better than any Harry had ever had by himself without looking. \u201cCome on, Severus,\u201d Harry said, and reached out towards the pants Severus still wore.\nThey Vanished before he got there. Harry blinked and looked at his hand, which certainly didn\u2019t hold a wand, then over at the table beside the bed. No, Severus\u2019s wand was still there, too.\n\u201cImpatient, aren\u2019t you,\u201d Severus said. \u201cVanishing something with wandless magic normally takes more practice than that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve had all the practice I want on my own,\u201d Harry said, and planted his heels on the bed and wriggled his arse at Severus. Severus had to let go of him when he moved, and now his eyes were so wide and dark that Harry imagined he must have trouble seeing at all. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\u201cImpatient,\u201d Severus repeated, and walked slowly towards the bed, giving Harry glimpse after glimpse of his heavy, hanging cock without bringing it nearer fast enough. Harry reached for it. Severus caught his wrist and kissed the bump of the bone there.\n\u201cLet me use the potions slowly at first. Since you have never done this with someone else before.\u201d\nThere was still a hint of question about those words. Harry snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re the Legilimens who\u2019s supposed to be able to detect lies. No, Severus, I really haven\u2019t done this before.\u201d\n\u201cI trust you. I\u2014simply cannot believe you could not find someone willing to indulge you.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want indulgence. I wanted something real. You can say that I waited for you, if you want to call it that.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I will call it that.\u201d Severus\u2019s voice was restrained, muffled, but his eyes returned to Harry\u2019s face, and Harry gasped aloud at the burn in them. Severus was holding himself back from showing how very, very much he liked that Harry had waited.\n\u201cPlease, Severus. Don\u2019t make me wait too long.\u201d\nSeverus, of course, went back to get the robe that apparently had potions in the pockets. At least when he came back, he was close enough to touch. Harry reached up eagerly for him, shivering the way he had when Severus touched his mark as his hands came to rest on smooth skin. There were scars here, too, but he didn\u2019t care. The leanness under them was also rolling and alive.\n\u201cLet me go, or we won\u2019t manage to fuck at all because I won\u2019t have lubed you up properly,\u201d Severus murmured from somewhere within his hair.\nHarry reluctantly did as he said, watching with half-lidded eyes that seemed to make Severus choke. He didn\u2019t recognize the clear potion that Severus spread over his fingers and cock and Harry\u2019s hole, but it was warm and slippery and would do the job nicely. And it both scorched him and made him want to laugh to see Severus concentrating on sliding his fingers into him the way he had once concentrated on marking essays.\n\u201cStillness,\u201d Severus murmured as his fingers finally slid in, and then he spread them wide. Harry lounged back with his arms behind his head. He\u2019d done this to himself a few times, but it was pretty different to have someone else in there.\nAnd Severus showed a lot more skill at finding his prostate than Harry ever had on his own, too. He jackknifed his legs wide with a cry. \u201cSeverus!\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, I am coming.\u201d\n\u201cNot until you\u2019re in me.\u201d\n\u201cInsolence,\u201d Severus said, but there was no trace of haughtiness or scolding in his voice. His eyes traveled again from Harry\u2019s arse to his face, and then the mark on his throat. There was awe hidden behind the way he was stroking himself, getting himself ready. Harry swallowed, reminded again of how Severus had acted when he first found out that Harry had a soul-mark.\n\nMaybe I should have known then how he would react when he found out he was mine. It would have been all right. He would have been honored, just like he said most people who knew about it would have been.\n\nBut Harry wouldn\u2019t let himself regret. If he had given in then and just revealed the mark to Severus, they wouldn\u2019t have got to know each other as well, and he might never have managed to shake the lingering fear that Severus was with him only out of duty or because of what the wizarding world would think of him if they found out he\u2019d rejected his soulmate.\n\u201cToo much thinking, Harry,\u201d Severus said, voice thick with affection, and Harry returned to reality with a start. Yes, there was awe in his eyes, but also the same listening intelligence that Harry had seen during so many of their conversations, and the fondness that had been there when Severus had said that anyone who refused to be with Harry must know only his hero complex. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Please. I\u2019d like you inside me.\u201d\nSeverus shivered, and began to slide himself slowly within Harry. Harry had to grunt in discomfort several times, and Severus always paused when he did, watching him carefully. Harry would nod, and they would go on until the next moment that Harry\u2019s body objected to having a cock in him.\nHarry had looked up a few of the legends about soul-marks on his own when Hermione had first told him how rare they were. He couldn\u2019t say that he believed the ones about how the mark was supposed to ease sex along now.\nBut finally, Severus was all the way there, and the expression of joy and pleasure on his face mirrored the one that Harry knew was on his own. Severus reached down and grasped his hands. Smiling, Harry held on tight.\n\u201cYou are a wonder,\u201d Severus breathed as he began to move.\nHarry enjoyed it all: the thrusts, the way Severus\u2019s eyes kept fluttering shut as if he wanted to hold them open and couldn\u2019t, the soft grunts pulled out of both of them, how their breathing became harsher and faster, the tightening clamp of Severus\u2019s fingers around his. The pleasure that burned in him and danced up through his belly and chest.\nThe softer burning of the soul-mark on his throat, like something with a destiny fulfilled.\nAnd Severus opened his eyes suddenly and reached out, freeing his right hand from Harry\u2019s, to trace one of the letters of the mark, and Harry came.\nIt was a burst of white noise in his head, sudden orgasm sweeping over him and pushing him up to fever pitch and not letting him go, not as long as Severus\u2019s finger rested there. Harry had the distinct impression that he shrieked. But he couldn\u2019t hear himself. The room was full of dozens of streaks of light, and he gasped through it, and he thrust his arse back, trying to share the pleasure, trying to make Severus come with him.\nSeverus only came when it seemed he absolutely had to, and his hand jolted off Harry\u2019s mark. Harry was just as glad; there was only so much wild pleasure he could take. He watched with a smile as Severus shuddered and pumped into him for a few moments, then caught himself on his elbows and hissed between his teeth.\n\u201cWorth the wait?\u201d Harry asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d was all Severus said, and Harry\u2019s heart picked up a beat as soft and warm as the burn of the mark.\n*\nThey were curled up in bed later, after an enjoyable shower and an even more fun handjob, when Harry felt Severus\u2019s hand come to rest on his throat right below the mark. Harry had been almost asleep, but he turned to look over his shoulder.\nSeverus was staring at him. Harry saw his throat bob as he swallowed.\n\u201cThe mere thought that I might never have forced the issue, and you might never have told me,\u201d Severus said, and paused for a long while. Harry lay and listened to their hearts beat, a throb off the beat from the mark.\n\u201cIt is devastating,\u201d Severus whispered at last. \u201cPromise me that you will never keep anything like this from me again.\u201d\nHarry touched his hand. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI would never have in the first place if I hadn\u2019t thought your life would be happier without me, in the freedom you earned.\u201d\n\u201cIf I have earned happiness, I have earned you,\u201d Severus said, voice suddenly harsh. \u201cAnd I will do my best to guard your own happiness. I will love you. I promise that. I will promise that until you believe me.\u201d\n\u201cI already do,\u201d Harry said, letting his eyes fall shut. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll love you in return. But promise me anyway.\u201d\nSeverus whispered the promise softly into his ear, again and again, and it was that, even more than the contented warmth of the mark, that let Harry drift off to sleep.\n\nThe End. \n"
