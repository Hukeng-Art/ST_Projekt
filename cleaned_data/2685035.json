    "text": "empathy (noun)1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ability to understand and share the feelings of another--John always found it hard to pin down exactly when he'd realised what he was doing was out of the ordinary.\u00a0 When you were a child, you thought your world was the only world that existed, that everything that happened to you and everything you did was normal, and no one ever experienced anything differently.\u00a0 Gradually, through comments of 'you can't possibly know that John', 'what an imagination you have' and 'stop lying' he became aware that no one else knew what other people were feeling all the time.They could tell, of course, from facial expressions and voice tones but they didn't know, not in the way John did.\u00a0 They didn't feel a faint curl of sadness in the back of their mind when someone was crying, they didn't feel a flicker of embarrassment and shame when someone tripped over in the street, and they couldn't cheer someone up just by thinking really happy thoughts at them.And as he\u2019d gradually realised this made him unusual, made him different, John started trying to hide it.\u00a0 At first because no one believed him, but then because he was frightened they\u2019d take him away and lock him up in a laboratory somewhere.\u00a0 He once saw a movie that involved a man getting a lobotomy, and had nightmares about it for years afterwards.So his first reaction to Sherlock\u2019s deductions wasn\u2019t affront or offense, but shock, awe and a tentative hope.\u00a0 John had tried to squash it, tried to tell himself to be calm and logical about it, but nothing could silence the tremulous question in the back of his mind.Is he\u2026like me?But eventually, he learned that Sherlock wasn\u2019t like him.\u00a0 He was just clever; very, very clever.\u00a0 It was still fascinating and amazing and brilliant and all those things, of course it was\u2026but it was also a little disappointing.\u00a0 Just a little, just in the secret corners of John\u2019s heart.He used to ask people about it.\u00a0 He\u2019d talk about auras, about psychics, and ask people if they believed it and then watch them, feeling about for a flicker of acknowledgement or fear or recognition.But it never came.\u00a0 John was alone.And perhaps that was a good thing.\u00a0 John called what he was doing \u2013 or had done, because he was holding to his vow not to use it again \u2013 empathy.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t telepathy, because he wasn\u2019t picking up on people\u2019s thoughts, only their emotions, and it wasn\u2019t clairvoyance because he wasn\u2019t seeing the future, so empathy was the best descriptor he could come up with.\u00a0 But whatever it was, it could do its fair share of damage.\u00a0 And after Thomas, and Kemp\u2026well, it was probably a good thing he\u2019d never found anyone else like him.Wouldn\u2019t want too many monsters running around, after all.--\u201cSo, you\u2019ll stay.\u201d\u00a0 It was phrased as a statement, but John could feel the way anxiety suddenly shot sticky black needles through Sherlock\u2019s voice.\u201cOf course I\u2019ll stay,\u201d John snorted, picking over his fried rice to see if any more of those tasty shrimp pieces were lurking around.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t shoot people for just anyone, you know.\u201d\u201cPatently untrue \u2013 if it were a good cause, you would do whatever you deemed necessary.\u201dJohn could concede that Sherlock was right about that; the shooting part, at least.\u00a0 But before the shooting, John had used his empathy.It wasn\u2019t much.\u00a0 Just a little nudge of concrete-thick confusion and hesitation to slow Sherlock down, make him pause before swallowing the pill, buy John time to get his gun out and load it.\u00a0 But he\u2019d still done it \u2013 a vow he\u2019d sworn to uphold, that he\u2019d stuck by for over six months, and he\u2019d thrown it out the window as soon as Sherlock was threatened.He should probably be more concerned by that.\u00a0 But he couldn\u2019t regret it, not really \u2013 he liked Sherlock.\u00a0 The man\u2019s emotions were just so\u2026honest.People (indeed, Sherlock himself) might claim that the man was emotionless, but he wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 John might have tried to suppress his empathy but he still felt Sherlock\u2019s emotions leaking out of him, wavering through the air like heat shimmers.\u00a0 Sherlock had emotions, of course he did, but he was more controlled about them than other people.\u00a0 At least, those not linked to frustration or excitement \u2013 those were always on clear display.In many ways, it was a relief.\u00a0 Other people got angry, then pretended they weren\u2019t because they didn\u2019t want others to think they had a temper.\u00a0 Other people were sad, and pretended they weren\u2019t because they didn\u2019t want to share their grief with the world.\u00a0 Other people were amused, and then tried to pretend solemnity, because they didn\u2019t want people to think they were morbid or weird.\u00a0 Other people hated, and pretended fondness because it was politic.\u00a0 Other people pretended, full stop, and the mixed signals \u2013 the confusion between what his empathy was telling him and what his eyes and ears told him \u2013 often gave John headaches.There was never any kind of confusion with Sherlock, and it was refreshing.\u00a0 Correction, it was bloody magnificent, and John knew he would have put up with a lot worse than casual insults and disregard for his personal autonomy just to tag along after that kind of clarity.He needed to be careful with this.--\u201cDo you object to rich bankers in general or Sebastian Wilkes in particular?\u201dJohn turned his head, jerked out of the breathing exercise he\u2019d been engaging in to try to calm himself down.\u00a0 \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dYou don\u2019t like him,\u201d Sherlock observed.\u00a0 \u201cYou barely spoke to him, and didn\u2019t shake his hand when we left.\u201d\u201cYeah, well, he\u2019s kind of an arsehole,\u201d John muttered.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t say that Sebastian\u2019s frustration had scraped over him like piano wire, setting his teeth on edge like fingernails dragged over chalkboard.Physical contact always enhanced his empathy (that handshake had been a mistake), but he might have dealt with it better if he hadn\u2019t had to make a grocery run earlier that morning.Really, this was just one more example of how this whole thing was more curse than gift.\u00a0 If John didn\u2019t have his empathy, he might have stood a better chance at keeping his head when he was dealing with the stupid chip and pin machine.But he always got so frustrated in grocery stores; so many other people were rushing around \u2013frantic to pick up tonight\u2019s dinner before their kids got off school, wishing the line in front of them would move just a bit faster, cursing the customer in front of them for taking the last bit of smoked cheddar \u2013 that John couldn\u2019t help but pick up on it.\u00a0 He always tried to make his shopping trips short because after twenty minutes he started to become restless and impatient, like he was inhaling that cloud of frustration and it was slowly permeating his blood, an emotional form of passive smoking.The tube was another problem place for much the same reasons, which was why John preferred to walk and didn\u2019t grumble (much) over Sherlock\u2019s love of cabs.So shaking hands with Sebastian at the bank ended up putting him in a very foul mood.\u00a0 Sebastian was brimming with resentment and thwarted ambition and god, why were so many people so unhappy?\u00a0 There were times when John thought city life was just inherently unsuited for the human race, and everyone should move back to the caves and start over.\u201cYou\u2019re tense,\u201d Sherlock observed.\u00a0 His voice was quiet, probably meant to be soothing, but John\u2019s muscles only bunched tighter.\u201cYeah, just\u2026\u201d John shrugged, and told a partial truth.\u00a0 \u201cToo many people.\u201dSherlock made a soft humming noise that John assumed was either understanding or considering.\u00a0 But when they hit the tight crush of the street, John couldn\u2019t help noticing that Sherlock was manoeuvring himself to stand between John and the worst of the crowd.--John had always known he could make his emotions bleed into other people, and he\u2019d always tried to push positive emotions to make people happier and more relaxed.\u00a0 If he was going to influence people like that, he might as well make it a good influence, after all.\u00a0 At least until\u2026Kemp.That had been the first indication of how dangerous his empathy could be.\u00a0 Before Kemp, John had never really thought to use it as a weapon.But he used it as a weapon now \u2013 there was someone else in the apartment with Sherlock, someone who smelt of smoke-sharp frustration and oily-bitter determination \u2013 and John knew he needed to do something.\u00a0 He pounded on the door and vented some of his frustration, trying to get Sherlock to let him into the apartment.When Sherlock\u2019s monologue cut off, emotions fracturing into glass splinters of terror, John knew it was time to stop messing around.\u00a0 Kicking in the door would take too much time (and to be honest, John wasn\u2019t entirely sure he was physically capable of it), but there was something else he could do.John dredged up all the fear he was feeling \u2013 along with the memories of every moment he\u2019d ever been scared or hurt \u2013 and threw them all at the foreign signature above him.\u00a0 He wrapped the stranger in them, smothered and drowned them beneath unreasoning, unquestioning fright until rational thought was erased and all that was left was the instinctual response.Run.John felt the person flee, and smiled grimly to himself.He\u2019d broken his vow again.\u00a0 And again, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to regret it.--John spent several minutes mulling over how best to approach the matter, but in the end just decided to go for the bulldozer method.\u201cHow bad is your throat?\u201d he demanded.Sherlock didn\u2019t start, but his face twitched like he was surprised.\u00a0 \u201cMy what?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid, it doesn\u2019t suit you \u2013 your throat, how it is?\u201dNow Sherlock was looking intrigued.\u00a0 \u201cHow did you know?\u201dJohn couldn\u2019t exactly confess that he\u2019d been able to sense a second person in the apartment, so he went for the next best thing.\u00a0 \u201cYour little deduction-rant cut off and now your voice sounds hoarse; it\u2019s not much of a leap to think something happened.\u00a0 Did you suddenly develop a cold?\u201d\u201cThere was someone in the apartment, he tried to choke me and he left this,\u201d Sherlock admitted, pulling out a folded black lotus flower and speaking very rapidly as though he thought he could distract John.John gave into an impulse he\u2019d been feeling for a long time, and reached up to cuff Sherlock across the back of the head.\u00a0 \u201cYou see?\u00a0 You see? This is what happens when you lock the trained soldier out of the apartment!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was in there,\u201d Sherlock protested.\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you take me!\u201d John hissed, keeping his voice low.Sherlock huffed and said nothing, which meant he knew he\u2019d made a mistake and didn\u2019t want to admit it.John knew he should leave it at that \u2013 he\u2019d broken his vow too many times already.\u00a0 And in spite of what he\u2019d used to think, he clearly didn\u2019t have control over this facet of his ability \u2013 Thomas had proved that.But on the other hand, he could ease Sherlock\u2019s pain, ensure there were no complications\u2026God, he was like a drug addict, always making excuses.\u00a0 Besides, it probably wouldn\u2019t work.But John already knew what he was going to do.\u00a0 \u201cCome here, I can do something for your throat.\u201dSherlock looked vaguely suspicious.\u00a0 \u201cIf it involves drinking some sort of horrid liquid-\u201d\u201cDo you see a tea kettle tucked under my jacket?\u00a0 Now shut up, come here, and trust me.\u201dTo John\u2019s surprise, Sherlock did just that, stepping well into his personal space and staring down at him with an air of expectation.\u00a0 He radiated a tangy sort of curiosity, the low engine-thrum of excitement that was presumably about the case, bright sparks of bitter pain from the attempted strangling and a rich, bright glow of simple, uncomplicated trust.It had been a while since someone had felt that sort of thing for him, and John needed a moment to compose himself before he reached for Sherlock\u2019s neck.\u00a0 He pushed the scarf aside and laid his fingers over the reddening mark, massaging it gently.Then he took a deep breath, and reached for Sherlock\u2019s pain.The first time he\u2019d done this, he\u2019d been twelve and their dog \u2013 Gladstone \u2013 had wriggled under their fence and been hit by a car.\u00a0 John had been the one to find him, and he\u2019d taken the whimpering puppy in his arms, for a moment wishing that he could take the pain himself\u2026And then agony had roared through his body.\u00a0 John had passed out on the spot, and woken to Gladstone licking his face.\u00a0 The dog had been whining and wagging his tail, and moving like he\u2019d never been hit by a car at all.\u00a0 The previously mangled back legs were as straight and healthy as they\u2019d been that morning, and only the blood on Gladstone\u2019s fur and in the gutter told John he hadn\u2019t imagined the whole thing.It had taken John years to understand what he\u2019d done.\u00a0 Somehow his ability to feel and influence other people\u2019s emotions translated to being able to heal them as well.\u00a0 John wasn\u2019t sure how that was connected, but it only worked if he was willing to take on the pain of their injury.\u00a0 And not just the pain of the infliction, but all the pain they would have gone through as it healed, compressed into the space of perhaps a minute.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t work if he told himself his patient was going to die unless he healed them \u2013 his empathy had never been influenced by logic, after all.\u00a0 He had to care for the person enough to be genuinely, instinctively willing to take the pain from them, which made the number of people he could heal very limited indeed.But Sherlock was one of them.\u00a0 At least, John was fairly certain he was one of them.He was proven right when pain raced through his throat, sharp and sudden.\u00a0 It felt like his neck was collapsing, his throat being scraped raw as every little hurt or twinge Sherlock would have experienced until the bruises vanished rushed through him in the space of a minute.Good thing he was used to this.\u00a0 John kept his head ducked to hide the grimace, and swallowed rapidly to try to quell the lingering soreness.\u201cThat was very quick,\u201d Sherlock said, so abruptly John twitched.He probably should have drawn it out, massaged a bit longer to make it seem believable, but it was too late now.\u201cPressure points,\u201d John lied.\u00a0 \u201cThose years of medical school are good for something, you know.\u201dHe allowed himself one last stroke of his thumbs across Sherlock\u2019s throat, checking that he\u2019d healed it properly, and was surprised by the silk-shiver of desire that hissed up from Sherlock to greet him.Startled, John glanced up at Sherlock, but the detective\u2019s face was turned away, staring up at the house he\u2019d just left.It was a little disappointing, but not terribly surprising.\u00a0 Just because John\u2019s empathy meant he knew Sherlock leaned more towards celibate than asexual didn\u2019t mean he wanted John, and feeling desire for someone was a far cry from actually wanting to have sex with them.And when someone was feeling so affectionate and in love it felt like trilling birdsong and cotton floss sticking to the sides of John\u2019s mouth, it didn\u2019t necessarily mean they were in love with him.\u00a0 Mary had taught him that lesson.\u00a0 It had been painful, but not nearly as painful as the lesson Kemp taught him.\u00a0 Or when Thomas taught him the final lesson, the one that made him give up his empathy as a bad job, a mistake, some freaky mutation in his genes that should never have happened in the first place.Yet\u2026this was the second time he\u2019d used his empathy to save Sherlock\u2019s life.\u00a0 And maybe, if was very careful, he could use it to heal people again.But just small things.\u00a0 Nothing like Thomas.\u00a0 Nothing like that ever again.John was uncomfortably aware he sounded like alcoholic pleading that they only drank on special occasions.--There hadn\u2019t been many times in his life that John had been glad to go home alone after a date, but this was one of them; being knocked about the head didn\u2019t make for a good night.John brushed his fingers over the gash behind his ear, held together with three stitches.\u00a0 It stung painfully, and he quickly withdrew his hand \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a terribly large injury, but the scalp was very sensitive.\u201cThey said you didn\u2019t have a concussion,\" Sherlock said. \u00a0\"You could have gone home with her.\u201dHe sounded grumpy, but John could feel the guilt and worry Sherlock was stewing in, thickening in his lungs like noxious smoke.\u201cIt was the first date,\u201d John pointed out. \u00a0\u201cWhatever impression Mike may have given you about my dating prowess, I'm not in the habit of taking people to bed that quickly.\u201d\u201cHe did mention something about three continents,\u201d Sherlock smirked.He seemed amused, but there was a bitter tang of envy beneath there, along with scouring prickles of something like resignation and a thick blue flash longing.\u00a0 In short, it was far too much for John to sort out after he\u2019d come close to having his skull bashed in.So he ignored it and grimaced at Sherlock to express his disdain of that stupid nickname Murray had saddled him with.Most of his friends had been astounded by his so-called \u2018success\u2019, but John couldn't really take any pride or satisfaction in it. \u00a0His empathy ensured he always knew when someone was genuinely interested in him, and often warned him when he was starting to do something that would put them off. \u00a0He had a small window into people's minds while everyone else was stumbling around with conversational cues and body language \u2013 of course he seemed like some kind of Casanova by comparison. \u00a0Which sounded brilliant, but in reality was often just messy and painful, and ensured a one-night stand was almost an impossibility for him \u2013 other people might have been able to have sex with people they were essentially indifferent to, but John had to genuinely like them. \u00a0He\u2019d tried going to bed with people he didn't really care about on only two\u00a0occasions, and each time the near-constant contact with their emotions his empathy provided made him tense and frustrated, like a cat having its fur rubbed the wrong way.He didn't feel that with Sarah, though.\u00a0 She was...well, nice. \u00a0Her emotions were sweet and clear and honest, like the peal of a chapel bell.People\u2019s emotions changed, of course they did, but everyone had their own\u2026signature, for lack of a better word \u2013 a strange mishmash of sight/sound/smell/taste/touch along with something else, something beyond those five senses, something that was purely his empathy.\u00a0 The emotions might vary, but the signature stayed the same, and in John\u2019s mind, Sarah would always be linked to the image of a church bell sounding out the dawn.John's mother had felt like a meadow, like soft grass and pastel flowers with little insects buzzing over them.\u00a0 His father had felt like cloth, like threads of all different colours and textures weaving together, sometimes separate, sometimes blending to create something entirely new.\u00a0 Harry felt like a jewel, like a bright red ruby set in cold silver, all sparkling and sharp, sometimes so bright it hurt his eyes.It meant he was able to identify people with his empathy \u2013 when he was a kid, John had always known when Harry was coming home from school because he could sense her walking down the street \u2013 but only if they were familiar to him. \u00a0After all, he'd had no clue he and Sherlock were apparently being followed for days. \u00a0And it hadn\u2019t warned him he was about to be kidnapped; empathy wasn't telepathy, and while he'd been able to feel that their kidnapper was metal-bright determined and resolved, there had been no fireworks of anger or hatred to warn John they were in danger.At least he'd known not to panic and try some last-ditch, suicidal escape plan when he felt Sherlock coming. \u00a0He'd felt him from almost half a mile away \u2013 Sherlock's signature was very...unique. \u00a0It always made John think he was standing in the midst of a labyrinth of caves \u2013\u00a0immense and intimidating and sparkling with astonishing crystal formations, fading into shadows and hidden depths.Though something about Sarah seemed to irritate Sherlock for some reason.\u00a0 John couldn\u2019t pin down why \u2013 the cavern of Sherlock\u2019s emotions got dark and flooded and choked his throat when Sarah was brought up.\u00a0 There was the gritty silt of irritation, yes, some vague sharp flavours of jealousy (probably resenting those moments when he wasn\u2019t the centre of John\u2019s attention) and something that felt puzzlingly like shivering insecurity and resonating loneliness, but that was as much as John could make out.Sometimes, John wished everyone\u2019s emotions were exactly the same, instead of the billions of shades and nuances and mixtures they actually were \u2013 he\u2019d probably have managed to sort out every possible combination by now if that was the case.But he wasn\u2019t that lucky, and instead he was stuck with strange echoes of feeling and a whole lot of confusion.Just like everyone else.\u00a0 Well, not really.--If Sarah was a church bell and Sherlock was a winding set of caverns then Molly was like a river.\u00a0 Clear and calm apart from the occasional floods and flurries, and far deeper than it looked.But the man with her was different.\u00a0 The happiness and excitement were genuine, but they seemed thin, as insubstantial as mist drifting across\u2026nothing.\u00a0 A gaping hole like an empty grave, like someone had reached inside and cut out everything inside him.John did his best not to touch Jim or look at him.\u00a0 He was almost grateful when Sherlock told Molly he was gay (almost, because really, that could have been done with a lot more tact) because at least she\u2019d been warned off him.\u00a0 And John doubted anything he said would have made an impact \u2013 what could he have said, after all?\u00a0 He didn\u2019t think a \u2018sorry, but your new boyfriend feels like the kind of person who\u2019d kill people just for fun\u2019 would go down well.He\u2019d still considered saying something, but then he remembered how wrong his empathy had been about Kemp, and kept silent.Still, considering that introduction, he wasn\u2019t entirely surprised when he woke up in the pool changing room, his hands cuffed to the railing, to find Jim grinning down at him.\u00a0 He stared for a moment, then made himself look away, trying not to get sucked down into that black emptiness.\u201cWhat, no exclamation of surprise?\u201d Jim drawled.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m disappointed, Johnny \u2013 don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t remember me.\u201d\u201cJim, dating Molly, works in the IT department at Bart\u2019s and seemingly gay,\u201d John recited wearily.\u00a0 \u201cThough I\u2019m assuming none of that is actually true, and that the name \u2018Moriarty\u2019 means something to you.\u201d\u201cHe fell for that little trick with the underwear then, did he?\u201d Moriarty giggled.\u00a0 \u201cHow delightful.\u201dJohn wasn\u2019t surprised to learn it was a trick.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t think Moriarty was gay \u2013 he didn\u2019t think he was anything, really.\u00a0 He think Moriarty could be anything, not with that\u2026emptiness.He made himself look again, made himself stare into that yawning void and couldn\u2019t help but wonder what had happened to make Moriarty like that.Something must have shown on his face, because Moriarty\u2019s expression suddenly went blank and flat, dead eyes glittering like a shark\u2019s.\u201cIs that pity I\u2019m seeing on your face?\u201d Moriarty hissed, leaning in close.\u00a0 \u201cPity? When you\u2019re the one about to be strapped to a bomb?\u201dJohn had no idea what Moriarty was seeing, but it probably was pity.\u00a0 Because he looked at this man, this man who\u2019d killed so many people just to attract Sherlock\u2019s attention, and the main thought in his head was \u2018you poor, sad sod\u2019.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare pity me!\u201d Moriarty suddenly snarled, slapping John across the face.John automatically turned his head to absorb the blow, absently noting that Moriarty clearly wasn\u2019t used to hitting people.\u00a0 He had slapped John instead of punching him, and it was a rather ineffectual slap at that \u2013 just a sharp sting, and it probably wouldn\u2019t even bruise.It was loud though; a sharp smack of flesh against flesh, and the sound seemed to restore Moriarty\u2019s composure.\u00a0 He stepped back, straightened his suit, and grinned.\u201cYou already know how this works, so I won\u2019t bore you with the details,\u201d he said, tossing an earpiece into the air and catching it again.\u00a0 \u201cDo exactly as I say, say exactly what I want, and I might let you live through this.\u201dWith anyone else, John might have been able to tell if they were lying \u2013 there might have been a sharp, illicit thrill at the idea of making him dance to their tune when they were just going to kill him anyway, like the icy point of a needle pricking his thumb.\u00a0 There might have been smugness, thick and rich like melted chocolate, there might have been stinging-sandpaper guilt or chili-scented anticipation or something.\u00a0 But with Moriarty, that emptiness offered him no clue, no hope, not a single shred of insight.He hadn\u2019t seriously pushed anything on anyone since he\u2019d made that Lotus bloke run away from Sherlock.\u00a0 The slight nudges to Sherlock when the detective was in one of his moods were always half-hearted, always tinged with the thought that Sherlock would come out of it eventually, and maybe he should just leave him to his sulk.\u00a0 But now, staring into Moriarty\u2019s face, John gathered all the fear and despair he was feeling and pushed.And it was sucked into the emptiness like light going into a black hole.\u00a0 There and then gone, without leaving even the slightest impression.The feeling of his emotions spiralling away into the void left John feeling like he was standing on the very edge of a very tall building.\u00a0 Sick with vertigo, the drop making him feel dizzy, and he jerked his gaze away from Moriarty before he vomited.And he did exactly as Moriarty ordered.Maybe this was what he deserved.\u00a0 John didn\u2019t really believe in karma or some kind of cosmic justice, but maybe this was his punishment for what he\u2019d done to Thomas.--Afghanistan had been when John began to understand other, less pleasant aspects of his empathy.\u00a0 Well, it was hardly pleasant to be able to feel people\u2019s misery and pain simply by virtue of close proximity, and Kemp had shown him that his empathy could have devastating consequences, but he\u2019d never considered that his empathy could truly be a weapon before.Until he found he could create a neat hole in firing lines by pushing fear and despair like mustard gas onto the enemy soldiers, to the extent that they dropped their guns and cowered while he ran to treat the wounded.\u00a0 Until he realised he could raise the flagging spirits of his comrades with some subtle nudges of hope and courage and happiness like sweet-smelling coffee.\u00a0 The officers always liked it when he came around, saying that everyone seemed much happier after he\u2019d visited.John always laughed it off and gave some weak excuse about being a people person.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d noticed this side-effect of his empathy \u2013 even when he wasn\u2019t deliberately trying to influence others, he seemed to instil a sense of calm and relaxation.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t sure why, but it was very useful when treating patients \u2013 they had to be well and truly worked up before they even started to get nervous.He also found it easier to heal people in the army.\u00a0 You were much more motivated to take on a comrade\u2019s pain than an acquaintance\u2019s.\u00a0 And for a while, it was good; he was healing people, and he\u2019d finally found a use for his empathy \u2013 there was actually a point to picking up on people\u2019s heartbreak and terror.Then John fucked up, and it changed everything.Thomas was ginger and freckled, and burned whenever he forgot his sunscreen.\u00a0 He seemed to find the whole thing more funny than irritating, though, and grinned at John whenever he asked how he was doing.\u00a0 He had a habit of looking up at John through his eyelashes, and he shared the care packages he got from his parents, and John thought maybe, maybe\u2026Then Thomas tripped a mine when they were scouting the road for a convoy.John managed to tackle him off it, but half of Thomas\u2019 right leg had been blown off.\u00a0 John had automatically put pressure on the injury, reaching for Thomas\u2019 pain to heal him, in that moment not even caring if half the bloody squad saw what he was doing.But then something had hit his left shoulder like a hammer, and John felt himself falling.\u00a0 He felt his link with Thomas fading, his own pain overwhelming his empathy, and in his panic he grabbed for every ounce of Thomas\u2019 pain he could feel and pulled.John passed out on the spot.\u00a0 And when he awoke, he had a hole in his shoulder and a pending honourable discharge for medical reasons.\u00a0 All of which he didn\u2019t really care about at the time because they\u2019d had him on some very strong drugs.They began to wean him off the morphine on his second day of consciousness, and it was then that his scattered thoughts came together enough to ask about Thomas and if he could see him.\u00a0 His doctors weren\u2019t happy about it, but John promised quite faithfully to be a good patient as soon as he\u2019d seen Thomas, and threatened to be as difficult as possible if he wasn\u2019t allowed to.\u00a0 Which wouldn\u2019t have worked back in London but this was Afghanistan, and perhaps it was a bit unethically sound to take advantage of overworked medics, but John didn\u2019t care.\u201cIt\u2019s not pretty,\u201d was Dr. Nguyen\u2019s warning.\u00a0 \u201cHis leg\u2019s fine, but we think he has brain damage.\u201dFor a moment, John had been sure she was joking.\u00a0 \u201cBrain damage?\u201dNguyen nodded.\u00a0 \u201cHe seems to be catatonic.\u00a0 We\u2019d need someone to get a look at him and make sure it\u2019s not trauma related, but\u2026\u201dShe shook her head and sighed.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve seen catatonic people, and he isn\u2019t catatonic.\u00a0 I honestly have no idea what\u2019s wrong with him, but brain damage is the most likely explanation.\u201dJohn\u2019s chest clenched in dread, and he was grateful she left him to enter the room alone.Thomas was sitting on the bed, staring at the wall, and didn\u2019t even glance at John when he entered the room.\u00a0 Very much like a catatonic patient, except for the small smile and almost blissful expression on his face.\u201cHey, Thomas,\u201d John said, not really expecting a reply.Thomas didn\u2019t so much as blink.\u00a0 But John wasn\u2019t deterred \u2013 if the brain damage was physical, maybe he could heal him?He sat beside Thomas bed on the bed, and took his hand, reaching for his pain\u2026But there was none.\u00a0 No pain, no damage, no trauma, only pure contentment.John had taken Thomas\u2019 pain.\u00a0 But not only the physical, as he\u2019d intended to \u2013 he\u2019d taken all of his pain, every negative memory and emotion.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t just given Thomas relief from physical agony; he\u2019d given him peace.\u00a0 Permanently.And it was sickening.\u00a0 Because everyone needed a little discontent in their lives.\u00a0 It was what gave people ambition, made them strive for new things \u2013 the feeling that \u2018okay, things are nice now, but they could be better\u2019.He\u2019d left Thomas completely content, completely at peace, no matter what happened around him or even to him.\u00a0 And it was the most horrifying thing John had ever seen.Thomas\u2019 family wanted to meet him.\u00a0 John declined.\u00a0 He was invalided home.\u00a0 John didn\u2019t fight it.He\u2019d always known he had to be careful with his empathy.\u00a0 But he\u2019d never dreamed he was capable of something so hideous.\u00a0 He\u2019d never thought he could reach inside someone and take away everything that motivated them, everything that made them who they were, and leave them an empty, smiling shell that wouldn\u2019t even resent him because they\u2019d lost the capacity for resentment.John didn\u2019t think it was a coincidence that the day after he saw Thomas, he started limping.\u00a0 With the leg that Thomas was missing.After all, he\u2019d always known he was unusual, but that was the first time he\u2019d considered himself a monster.He never made any kind of effort to connect with people after his discharge, not even Harry.\u00a0 He locked himself in his flat and stared at his gun and contemplated eating a bullet.Because he was monster.\u00a0 And at the end of the story, the monsters didn\u2019t get happy endings.They died.--John was still shaky when they got back to the flat.\u00a0 Facing death was one thing \u2013 been there, done that \u2013 but the memory of that awful, sucking emptiness made him feel nauseous every time he thought about it.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t even tried to push anything onto the snipers, afraid Moriarty would just suck it all away.But he wouldn\u2019t take this lying down, either.\u00a0 John might have been willing to accept his own demise as punishment for Thomas and insurance he would never do such a thing again, but if Sherlock\u2019s death came with it?\u00a0 That was a line he refused to cross.For a while \u2013 a long while, really \u2013 John had considered his empathy useless.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t identify Kemp, after all, and his healing of Thomas had been disastrous.\u00a0 Still, he couldn\u2019t help but remember that his empathy had made him wary of Moriarty when even Sherlock had dismissed him.\u00a0 His empathy had allowed him to delay Sherlock taking the pill, and maybe it had some monstrous aspects, but maybe \u2013 now that he knew he had to be careful, now that he knew the horrific things it could do \u2013 maybe if he was careful, he could make it a force for good.\u00a0 Like he had back before\u2026Thomas.Maybe his empathy could be useful again, instead of a painful, misery-inducing burden.\u201cSherlock\u2026\u201d he began, slowly and carefully, making tea just to give himself something to do.\u00a0 \u201cHypothetically, say that-\u201dThe sudden crash of anger and fear from Sherlock was like the detonation of a grenade.\u00a0 \u201cWhat did he do?\u201dJohn blinked, trying to reorient himself after the sudden emotional backlash.\u00a0 \u201cSorry, what?\u201dSherlock was standing in the entrance to the kitchen, his eyes dark and his emotions wild.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re uncomfortable, your leg is giving you trouble, and while you usually value eye contact when speaking you\u2019ve yet to meet my eyes since we entered the house.\u00a0 All indications are that you are wrestling with something unpleasant that you want me to know, but fear my reaction to, so I will repeat \u2013 what did he do?\u201dSometimes, John thought it was almost funny, how Sherlock could see almost every detail of a situation but miss the one that explained it all.\u00a0 He was uncomfortable, and his leg was giving him trouble (Moriarty\u2019s emptiness was of a different flavour than Thomas\u2019, but it was still a disturbing reminder of his sins), and he was trying to discuss something unpleasant \u2026but Sherlock had assumed it was linked to Moriarty, that something had happened to John before he\u2019d arrived at the pool.Which John supposed wasn\u2019t an unreasonable assumption to make, considering.\u201cNothing,\u201d he said quickly.\u00a0 Then pulled a face and amended, \u201cWell, apart from the bomb and the snipers, but you were there for that part.\u00a0 And before that, he just did a lot of strutting around and talking, though he did slap me once.\u201dSherlock\u2019s fear dimmed like a failing bulb, but the smoky anger was still present, though it was tempered with treacle-thick confusion.\u00a0 \u201cHe slapped you?\u201dJohn nodded.\u00a0 \u201cPretty rubbish slap, actually \u2013 barely even hurt.\u00a0 Harry gave me worse when we were kids.\u201dSherlock snorted, shimmering amusement and cottony relief softening the edges of his fury as the corners of his mouth quirked, and John grinned.Then he looked down, forcing himself to concentrate on dipping his tea bag into the hot water.\u00a0 \u201cHypothetically-\u201d\u201cOh, must we have the charade?\u201d Sherlock sighed.\u00a0 \u201cI know you\u2019re referring to yourself, you know you\u2019re referring to yourself, can\u2019t we discard the-\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d John said firmly, interrupting whatever tangential rant Sherlock had been about to launch into.\u00a0 \u201cAnd yes, we must have the charade \u2013 it helps me, so you can just put up with it.\u201dHe took Sherlock\u2019s silence \u2013 and the vague throb of curiosity and something that felt disturbingly close to lumpy-armchair sympathy and minty worry \u2013 as consent.\u201cHypothetically,\u201d he repeated, just to hear Sherlock scoff.\u00a0 \u201cIf someone had been badly injured, and his doctor performed a risky, never-before-tested medical procedure to try to save him, and it killed him, would you say that doctor had committed a crime?\u201dHe thought framing it as a possible crime would get a more honest response from Sherlock.\u201cWould they have died anyway?\u201d came Sherlock\u2019s voice from behind him.John thought of the mangled mass of thigh \u2013 bone and gristle exposed to open air, everything below the knee just gone, blown into pieces, the way blood had squirted from the femoral artery, the already-depleted supplies in his kit and how far away they were from the base \u2013 and nodded.\u201cThen I don\u2019t see the moral dilemma.\u00a0 Medical procedures sometimes go wrong, don\u2019t they?\u201dThere was a note of reassurance in Sherlock\u2019s voice and in his emotions, and John realised that Sherlock was trying to comfort him.\u00a0 For a moment he almost laughed, wondering what the MET would think of the self-proclaimed sociopath now, trying to console John about losing a friend (and possibly something more) without the slightest trace of mockery.But the thing was, it worked.\u00a0 Somehow those words allowed John to relax, allowed him to finally shelve the guilt he\u2019d been carrying for months.\u00a0 It was still there, of course, but it didn\u2019t weigh as heavily on him.\u00a0 The thought had been growing for weeks, the thought that perhaps he\u2019d been too vicious with himself, that all doctors lost patients and made mistakes, and the point wasn\u2019t that they were perfect but that they were trying\u2026but he\u2019d needed someone else to say it.If it had been an ordinary, non-empathic medical procedure, he\u2019d have been reviewed by a board.\u00a0 Instead, he was being reviewed by Sherlock.And John tried not to think about the fact that Sherlock\u2019s tacit approval and absolution made him feel much better than any review board he\u2019d ever seen.He\u2019d already made up his mind about the bond, but he couldn\u2019t deny that made his decision seem that much more justifiable.\nbond (noun)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 something that binds, fastens or holds together\n--\nHarry often bemoaned that John didn\u2019t call or write or email, and John would make conciliatory noises and then still forget to do it because he could never explain to her why he forgot.\nWhen he was a kid, John had spent a lot of time with his sister.\u00a0 He\u2019d healed her scrapes and bruises a few times, and it was a rare day indeed that passed without Harry\u2019s familiar emotional signature surging and ebbing at the back of his mind.\nIt was only when she left home that John realised Harry\u2019s emotional signature was more than just \u2018familiar\u2019 to him \u2013 it was a constant.\u00a0 Whether they were separated by four feet of hallway or almost six thousand kilometres of land and sea, John always knew how Harry was feeling.\u00a0 Which meant he forgot to actually talk to her about it.\nJohn had often wondered exactly what it was he\u2019d done to form the bond, but he could never pin down the exact reason.\u00a0 Because he spent a lot of time with her?\u00a0 Because they\u2019d sometimes fallen asleep together, so exhausted that the line between their separate emotions blurred and ran in John\u2019s head until he couldn\u2019t tell what feelings were his own and what were Harry\u2019s?\u00a0 Because he\u2019d taken on her pain to heal her so many times during their lives?\nJohn didn\u2019t know how he did it, but it wasn\u2019t going to stop him trying to do the same with Sherlock.\nHis bond with his sister meant he always knew where she was \u2013 not precisely, not like a map, but more like a game of hot-cold.\u00a0 It meant he could heal her from a distance, like that time she\u2019d contracted liver cancer while he was in basic training (and John was in no hurry to live through a year of chemo in the space of five minutes ever again \u2013 officially, the cancer had been listed as a misdiagnosis).\nOf course, there were downsides to it as well \u2013 Harry\u2019s emotions came through much clearer, and affected John much more than anyone else\u2019s.\u00a0 It was one of the reasons he tried to avoid her when she was drinking \u2013 he needed to be in a good place himself, emotionally speaking, to resist her or they just dragged each other into a tailspin of misery.\nWhich was probably why he felt so apprehensive about the bond.\u00a0 He was going to give himself a direct window into Sherlock\u2019s emotions, which were volatile enough at the best of times \u2013 what would happen if John could compound his black moods, could drag him down even further without even meaning to?\nBut on the other hand, John had no intention of letting Sherlock wander into danger without him.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t going to watch Sherlock walk into a trap again, not without knowing there was something he could do to help him.\nIf he really was going to try putting his empathy to use again, he might as well go the whole way.\nAt least Sherlock was nearby, since he\u2019d fallen asleep on the sofa.\u00a0 He often did that after big cases \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t sleep a wink all through it, but would crash as soon as it was over and sleep like the dead.\u00a0 And by this point, the adrenaline from the pool would be wearing off as well; Sherlock might like to play it cool, but John had felt the raw, electrified fear that had filled him as soon as he realised that John was strapped to several kilos of Semtex.\nSo John waited fifteen minutes to make sure Sherlock was genuinely asleep, then knelt down beside him \u2013 fighting the ridiculous urge to brush Sherlock\u2019s hair off his forehead \u2013 and carefully entwined their fingers.\nHe\u2019d never had any idea what he\u2019d done with Harry to form the link between them.\u00a0 But he could feel it, like a weak glow in the back of his mind, so he did the best he could to mimic it.\u00a0 He took a deep breath, and tried to push his emotions at Sherlock, the way he did when he was trying to influence someone.\u00a0 Except he wasn\u2019t pushing just one emotion but every emotion, all of himself, hoping that something would latch on, would catch and stick\u2026\nSomething jolted in his chest, like his heart had been lightly squeezed and released.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t exactly pleasant, but there was definitely something there.\u00a0 Not quite the weak warmth that Harry was, but brighter and sharper and hotter.\u00a0 Maybe because he\u2019d linked himself to Sherlock deliberately this time, rather than it happening by accident.\nHe probed the link, testing it, and yes, that was definitely Sherlock.\u00a0 The same impression of depth and vastness and secrets John would never discover even if he explored for the rest of his life.\nAnd now it would be with him forever, tucked up inside his chest and head next to the soft, throbbing glow that was his link to Harry.\nHe released Sherlock\u2019s hand.\nHe\u2019d never deliberately formed a bond with anyone else before, not even Mary.\u00a0 He tried not to think about what that meant.\u00a0 Instead, John simply went upstairs and crawled into bed, only bothering to remove his shoes.\n--\nJohn awoke the next morning to the deafening crash that was his bedroom door bouncing off its hinges, and a flood of fear from Sherlock.\u00a0 He jerked upright, automatically reaching for some sort of weapon \u2013 his gun was too far away, but his alarm clock was heavy enough to do a decent bit of damage \u2013 until he realised Sherlock had stopped in the doorway, and the tremors of fear and panic were abating.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d John asked blearily.\nHis reflexes were still hair-trigger, but his brain needed about fifteen minutes of run time before he was properly woken up.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Sherlock said hastily.\n\u201cNo one charges up the stairs like an escaped rhinoceros because of \u2018nothing\u2019,\u201d John pointed out.\nSherlock looked affronted.\u00a0 \u201cI did not charge-\u201d\n\u201cYes you did,\u201d John interrupted, smothering a yawn.\u00a0 \u201cSo what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nSherlock was shifting his weight on the balls of feet, as if he were considering simply running away from the conversation.\u00a0 But he probably felt that was beneath his dignity.\nJohn was starting to get rather worried.\u00a0 \u201cSherlock?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026you weren\u2019t there.\u201d\nIt was mumbled, and seemingly directed at the curtains, but John knew what he\u2019d heard.\nDidn\u2019t mean it made any sense though.\u00a0 \u201cUm\u2026what?\u201d\n\u201cI woke up, and you weren\u2019t there,\u201d Sherlock repeated, looking as though every syllable physically pained him.\nAnd John understood.\n\u201cStupid, really, idiotic,\u201d Sherlock muttered, in the rapid-fire speech he usually used for his deduction.\u00a0 \u201cThere was no sign of a break-in or a struggle, I hadn\u2019t even checked your room, and yet\u2026how do people function like this?\u00a0 It\u2019s absolutely hideous-\u201d\nHe broke off, and John revelled in the cool flicker of surprise that lashed across the bond \u2013 it seemed he could still surprise Sherlock now and then, good to know.\u00a0 Of course, his attempts to surprise Sherlock didn\u2019t usually involve walking up to him and hugging him, but John was willing to take his victories where he could.\nAt that thought, he settled his arms more comfortably around Sherlock\u2019s waist.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t squeezing, just holding and standing close enough that his face was pressed against the side of Sherlock\u2019s neck.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Sherlock asked, holding himself rigid.\n\u201cTrust me, this helps.\u201d\u00a0 John deliberately sent feathery comfort and stone-hard love along the bond, trying to soothe away the last remnants of Sherlock\u2019s panic.\nSlowly, as though he thought if he did it gradually enough John wouldn\u2019t notice, Sherlock put his arms around John\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0 At first they were just resting there, but Sherlock\u2019s grip got incrementally tighter and tighter, until it bordered on uncomfortable.\nJohn just waited.\u00a0 He knew Sherlock cared about him \u2013 even if he wasn\u2019t an empath, Moriarty\u2019s promise to burn Sherlock\u2019s heart out while John was wrapped in explosives was a particularly unsubtle anvil.\u00a0 As was Sherlock\u2019s expression when he first stepped out and opened the coat.\nSo yes, Sherlock cared about him, John had never doubted that.\u00a0 Though he didn\u2019t care in the way Moriarty had implied \u2013 John suspected Sherlock didn\u2019t do romantic entanglements, and that was fine. \u00a0First and foremost, he was John\u2019s friend, which meant John wasn\u2019t going to burden him with\u2026this.\nIt was just a silly little infatuation anyway, sprinkled with a bit of hero worship.\u00a0 It would go away, he was sure.\u00a0 Or more precisely, he hoped.\nBecause being Sherlock\u2019s friend was one thing.\u00a0 Being in love with Sherlock\u2026well, John suspected that was very fast road to a whole lot of heartbreak.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to get yourself strapped to a bomb ever again,\u201d Sherlock said abruptly, yanking John out of his contemplation.\nJohn snorted.\u00a0 \u201cI promise I\u2019ll try to avoid it in the future.\u201d\n\u201cI mean it,\u201d Sherlock snapped, suddenly tense.\u00a0 \u201cYou need to be careful, he\u2026\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s voice trailed off like an engine winding down, and the bond quivered with sick confusion and elastic-tight worry and a strangely lost, almost helpless kind of feeling.\nJohn would have liked to tell him everything would be fine, but that would only be a lie.\u00a0 So he settled for, \u201cI\u2019ll be careful, I promise.\u201d\nSherlock nodded vaguely, but it was still a long time before his emotions quieted.\u00a0 And an even longer time before he made any move to let John go.\n--\nJohn was twenty-two when he fell in love.\u00a0 Her name was Mary, and she was a pre-med with an interest in punk rock and the kind of unashamed laugh that could fill a room.\u00a0 They were in the same group for practicals, and a friendly conversation had led to drinks, which led to dinner, which led to them tumbling into Mary\u2019s bed and not leaving until morning.\nIt had started out casual \u2013 they were friends who occasionally had sex, and while John had heard of that ending messily it had seemed to work for them.\nUntil the night Mary had come to dinner from the hospital, and John had finally identified the soft, glowy feeling that had been permeating her for weeks.\nIt was love.\u00a0 Mary was in love.\nJohn had spent the next day in a haze, wondering what to do about it, if he should do anything about it.\u00a0 What could he say anyway?\u00a0 Nothing that referenced his empathy, not if he wanted to get his degree without a detour to a psychiatric facility.\nMary was in love, and John knew about it \u2013 that much couldn\u2019t be changed.\u00a0 So John took a long, hard look at himself and asked if he loved Mary, if he could love Mary?\nAnd the answer was yes.\nSo they still went to dinner and drinks but now John considered them dates, and thought that they were \u2018going steady\u2019.\u00a0 He was on the verge of asking her to move in with him when she told him their arrangement had to come to an end; she\u2019d fallen in love with a nurse at the hospital.\nJohn knew that it was only his empathy that got his hopes up with Mary; if he hadn\u2019t been aware of the love she was feeling and mistakenly attributed it to him, he would never have thought it was anything more than friends with benefits.\nStill, he couldn\u2019t help feeling a little bitter.\nHe and Mary remained friends, but they fell out of touch when he went into the army.\u00a0 John fell out of touch with a lot of people then.\n--\nJohn could tell he and Sarah weren\u2019t going to last \u2013 he\u2019d got much better at this stuff since Mary.\u00a0 But he thought they were coming from the same place, at least.\u00a0 Neither of them were looking for marriage and babies, but they both wanted some company and some uncomplicated affection.\nThat didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t upset when she ended it.\u00a0 Not depressed, not torn up inside and feeling his own sorrow and loss like razors under his tongue, but certainly upset.\nSo he decided to have a lie-in to sleep off the emotional exhaustion, and was drifting in that wonderful place where you weren\u2019t quite asleep but weren\u2019t quite awake and knew you had absolutely no commitments for the rest of the day.\u00a0 His bonds were throbbing contentedly \u2013 Harry was asleep in her own bed, and Sherlock had been checking up on his homeless network for the past two days but was now approaching the flat.\u00a0 John spared a sleepy brain cell to hope that he wasn\u2019t going to do any experiments involving loud noises or fire.\nThe bond shivered briefly with curiosity, then suddenly sent waves of irritation and confusion, and John tried to rouse himself to respond, bidding farewell to his luxurious lie-in.\n\u201cJohn!\u201d\n\u00a0John dragged himself out of bed just in time for Sherlock to fling open the door to his room, stride over the threshold in a way that said he\u2019d worked himself up into a proper snit, before stopping dead in his tracks as though a wall had materialised in front of him.\n\u201cWe really have to have a talk about you battering down my door,\u201d John muttered.\n\u201cYou\u2019re naked,\u201d Sherlock said, in what John had come to think of as his \u2018I\u2019m surprised but trying not to show it\u2019 tone.\n\u201cWell done,\u201d John yawned.\nHe was still drowsy, but he woke up very quickly when he felt a hot, shaky flash of lust from Sherlock.\nIt disappeared as quickly as it had come \u2013 likely deliberately smothered beneath gruesome mental images \u2013 but John knew what he had felt.\u00a0 He felt it again \u2013 stronger and hotter \u2013 when he crossed the room and bent over to pull some underwear out of his bottom drawer.\nBut then this was nothing new.\u00a0 John was aware Sherlock was attracted to him, and he was equally aware Sherlock didn\u2019t want to do anything about it.\n\u201cIs there a particular reason you were yelling my name on a Saturday morning?\u201d John asked.\nSherlock blinked, and John saw him consciously move his eyes up to John\u2019s face.\u00a0 \u201cYou didn\u2019t text me.\u201d\nJohn tried to drag some kind of sense out of that statement, and failed.\u00a0 \u201cWhich means\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cLestrade texted me half a dozen times asking for my whereabouts, and they only cease with the message \u2018just texted John, he says you\u2019re safe, talk to me when you can\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u00a0 Did you actually want him to keep texting you?\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know I was safe?\u201d Sherlock demanded, looking almost affronted.\u00a0 \u201cI even got a text from Mycroft, which meant I managed to shake his spies for at least a day, so how did you know I was safe?\u201d\nIt was times like this that made John think it would be much, much easier if he just told Sherlock about his empathy.\u00a0 But then he remembered how eager Sherlock was to examine and dissect anything unusual, and a lifetime of caution reared its head.\u00a0 He knew Sherlock cared about him, but did he care about him enough not to experiment on him?\nJohn didn\u2019t know and, childishly, didn\u2019t want to find out \u2013 he\u2019d thought Kemp was a good bloke, after all, so what did that say about his judgement?\u00a0 It was far safer to let things continue as they were than to risk rocking the boat.\n\u201cYou were checking up on your homeless network,\u201d John said eventually.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t think I should be worried until a few days had passed.\u201d\nSherlock looked and felt baffled and mildly affronted.\u00a0 \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\nBecause he had a psychic link that allowed him to know where Sherlock was and what he was feeling.\u00a0 But John couldn\u2019t say that, so he settled for listing the other, more tangible signs.\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s been a bit of a cold snap, you\u2019ve been collecting old newspapers, and you didn\u2019t need all those scarves and gloves for yourself.\u201d\nSherlock was silent, and the expression on his face would have confused John if he hadn\u2019t been able to feel the tremulous wonder that whispered through the bond.\nThen Sherlock blinked, and seemed to come back to himself, the wonder suddenly crushed beneath irritation and a touch of resentment.\n\u201cWe\u2019re out of milk,\u201d he snapped, turning around and hurrying down the stairs.\n\u201cI bought two litres only yesterday!\u201d John cried.\u00a0 \u201cWhat the hell did you manage to do with it in the ten minutes you\u2019ve been home?\u201d\n--\u201cDo you just carry on talking when I\u2019m away?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2013 how often are you away?\u201d\nJohn\u2019s first reaction was worry.\u00a0 Could Sherlock feel the bond somehow?\u00a0 Certainly Harry had never shown any sign of being aware of their connection, but the link with Harry wasn\u2019t nearly as strong as the one he had with Sherlock.\nThe bonds certainly gave John a feeling of companionship, a reassurance that he was never alone, not really, but he\u2019d been the one to create them.\nHe told himself it meant nothing \u2013 that this was just one of Sherlock\u2019s many idiosyncrasies.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t know, he couldn\u2019t know.\nAnd even if he did, he wouldn\u2019t bundle John off to a laboratory\u2026would he?\nJohn liked to think not.\u00a0 But sometimes there were too many similarities between Sherlock and Kemp for John\u2019s comfort.\n--\nLloyd Kemp was John\u2019s favourite dissection partner in his labs.\u00a0 Most people didn\u2019t seem to like him \u2013 he had a knack for saying disturbingly insightful things at the exact wrong moment \u2013 but he had steady hands and a weird sense of humour that was strangely compatible with John\u2019s.\u00a0 Even if he did tend to treasure some beliefs about crystal healings and the like.\nSo when they were wandering back to the college drunk off their arses and Kemp was hit by a car that crushed his torso and collapsed his lung and just kept on going, John didn\u2019t even hesitate to bend down and heal him.\u00a0 A collapsed lung was a new experience, and it took him several long moments to get his breath back.\nWhen he was able to see past the pain, Kemp was staring up at him like a knight of the Round Table that had just found the Holy Grail.\nJohn told himself Kemp was too drunk to remember anything \u2013 and if he did, he would chalk it up to the alcohol and move on.\nHis mistake.\nThree days later, they went on another trip to the pub, and John had been out after his first drink \u2013 Kemp had slipped him something.\nWhen he woke, he awoke to bright lights and bondage.\u00a0 Which might have been nice, under other circumstances, but rising out of a groggy haze to find himself strapped to something a lot harder than a hospital bed was rather unnerving.\u00a0 His head felt like it was full of concrete, and he couldn\u2019t feel anything below his waist.\nHe\u2019d glimpsed Kemp in the corner of his eye, wearing a surgical mask and bloodstained gloves, and still John hadn\u2019t panicked.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t quite know why \u2013 perhaps because he thought it was some kind of prank?\u00a0 Because all he was picking up from Kemp was blue, pulsing curiosity with no taint of malice and so he didn\u2019t think he had anything to worry about?\n\u201cWha\u2026what\u2019s going on?\u201d John slurred, his lips and tongue feeling thick and uncooperative.\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Kemp said, with the high-pitched laugh he always used when he was worried about something.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve given you an epidural, so it shouldn\u2019t hurt-\u201d\nJohn heard nothing past \u2018epidural\u2019.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he mouthed weakly, feeling as though he was slowly sinking into some deep, dark pit.\nHe couldn\u2019t feel his legs.\u00a0 There was a tiny, horrified part of John\u2019s mind that just didn\u2019t want to look, but he looked.\nHe could see his own femur.\u00a0 His left thigh had been cut into, skin and blood vessels and stringy bits of fat peeled back like a curtain, revealing the underlying muscles and tendons and knotty nerves and the dull yellow of bone.\nJohn thought he might have been trying to scream.\u00a0 His mouth was open, and his chest was constricted and tight, but there was no sound coming from his throat.\n\u201cI always believed in it, you know,\u201d Kemp was saying conversationally, somewhat muffled behind the surgical mask.\u00a0 \u201cKnew there had to be more than just pills and surgery \u2013 I mean, look at the placebo effect!\u00a0 Our brains influence our healing so much, I just knew that there had to be someone who could influence other people\u2019s healing as well.\u00a0 And then when you saved me after the car\u2026\u201dThis is just a nightmare, John told himself.\u00a0 This is just a nightmare.\u00a0 It has to be, it has to be \u2013 there is no way this is actually happening\u2026\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Kemp said again, turning back to John with a scalpel in one hand and a small jar of liquid in the other.\u00a0 \u201cI just want a sample, just a bit of the lateral cutaneous nerve to see how your neurons are different.\u201d\nAnd with those words, it was easy (far too easy) for John to take all the fear he was feeling, every scrap of his terror at his worst nightmare being realised (imprisoned and experimented on), gather it up like a fireball and shove it onto Kemp.\u00a0 Every single, sodding bit of it.\nIt screamed out of John\u2019s head like a tornado, and he could feel the instant it hit Kemp and latched on hard, the force of the emotions practically pummelling him.\u00a0 Kemp\u2019s face contorted, looking as though he were about to scream but couldn\u2019t find the breath, and then he fell.\u00a0 John heard the sharp sound of glass breaking, and then Kemp\u2019s fear and pain just\u2026went out.\u00a0 Like a blazing lamp suddenly turned off.\nJohn passed out again, but he was never sure if that was whatever drugs Kemp had given him or the shock of feeling all that emotion \u2013 of feeling Kemp himself \u2013 just die.\n--\nIt had all been sorted out by the time John woke up, of course (Kemp had been using an empty practical lab and someone had found them).\u00a0 Kemp\u2019s family had a history of psychiatric issues, and the stress and pressure had caused him to have an episode.\u00a0 And at some point, the strain had simply gotten too much for his apparently weak cardiovascular system, and he\u2019d had a heart attack.\nIf John had actually wanted to truth to come out, he would have been able to poke a lot of holes in that story.\u00a0 What kind of delusion came on so abruptly and suddenly no one had noticed anything out of the ordinary until Kemp was cutting him up?\u00a0 How did a man in his mid-twenties with no history of cardiovascular disease suddenly die from a massive heart attack?\nBut the last thing John wanted was for people to start getting curious about what had happened.\u00a0 If the university wanted to sweep Kemp\u2019s little \u2018episode\u2019 under the rug, then that was fine with him \u2013 they could sweep away.\nHe was more concerned with what it said about him.\u00a0 He knew his little empathic nudges physically affected people \u2013 fear would make their palms sweaty, a little burst of happiness would help them relax \u2013 but he\u2019d never suspected it could be done to that kind of degree.\u00a0 He\u2019d given Kemp a heart attack by pushing his own fear onto the man; what other kind of damage could he do?\nFor a little while, John didn\u2019t think it made sense \u2013 how could emotions overload someone\u2019s system like that?\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t been having a heart attack, so how had he given Kemp one?\nThen they took him off the good drugs on the second day, and his more logical thoughts began to come back.\u00a0 And John realised that in a way, he probably should have expected it.\u00a0 He\u2019d been dealing with other people\u2019s emotions all his life, and his body had adapted to be able to cope with that kind of mental upheaval.\u00a0 But Kemp hadn\u2019t.\u00a0 John has shoved his fear onto him and when his fear had become Kemp\u2019s fear John had still been afraid, so he\u2019d just kept pushing and pushing, until he\u2019d pushed Kemp far past what the human body could cope with.\u00a0 Far past the level of fear anyone would experience naturally.\nReally, John was amazed it took Thomas to make him realise how awful his empathy could be.\n--\nJohn felt uncomfortable from the moment they entered Irene Adler\u2019s house.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t the deception (god knew he\u2019d had enough practice with that, working with Sherlock for so long) but the way his empathy was tugging at him, the way pain and sorrow were prodding him for acknowledgement like barbed wire stung between his bones.\nIt only got worse when he actually walked into the room.\u00a0 He knew Sherlock thought it was Irene\u2019s nakedness that meant he was having difficulty looking at her, but he couldn\u2019t have been further from the mark.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t Irene\u2019s body that was disturbing John, it was her mind.\nOr more specially, her emotions; they reminded him far too much of Moriarty.\u00a0 The feeling of emptiness was the same, but where Moriarty\u2019s hollowness was blunt, worn smooth with time \u2013 whatever happened to make him that way, it happened a very long time ago, long enough that it didn\u2019t hurt anymore \u2013 Irene\u2019s hole was jagged, open and bleeding the soft echoes of where there used to be\u2026something.\u00a0 Something more than grief and loss and a need for something to do, for anything that would take her mind off it for even a moment.\u00a0 Moriarty was like a black hole, consuming everything so that not even light escaped.\u00a0 Irene was like someone screaming from the bottom of a deep, dark well.\nHe could feel other emotions from her, of course.\u00a0 Happiness, triumph, smugness, curiosity\u2026but they felt thin.\u00a0 A paper mask daubed with bright colours to cover the hole beneath.\n\u201cCould you put something on?\u201d he asked, mainly because he couldn\u2019t see any clothes lying about so she\u2019d have to leave the room to put something on, which would give him some time to collect himself.\nShe didn\u2019t leave, of course, just borrowed Sherlock\u2019s coat (and John wasn\u2019t jealous of the way they didn\u2019t even seem to be aware of his presence except when they were using him to snipe at each other, he wasn\u2019t).\u00a0 He sat beside her on the sofa, and tried to push some happiness, safety and peace on her, a big ball of emotions like a purring, contented cat \u2013 he just wanted to be able to think past the grief pouring from her like a burst pipe \u2013 but it just skated off her like watercolour on oily glass.\nHe tried again, with the same result.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t like Moriarty \u2013 she didn\u2019t suck it into nothingness, it just\u2026didn\u2019t stick.\nJohn had always known his little nudges were palliatives, not cures, but he was still a little shaken by a grief so deep he couldn\u2019t even make the faintest impression on it.\nWhat could have happened to hurt someone that much?\nHe was actually quite glad for Sherlock\u2019s order to \u2018man the door\u2019 \u2013 it meant he could get out of the room and get some distance between him and Irene\u2019s suffocating emotions.\u00a0 Sometimes (well, most of the time, really) his empathy was more trouble than it was worth.\nAfter all, he was so busy keeping himself from getting sucked into Irene\u2019s sorrow that he completely missed the men sneaking up on him.\n--\nJeanette calling Sherlock his boyfriend had hit a bit too close to home.\u00a0 John was painfully aware that people had good reason to think he and Sherlock were a couple; they had a plethora of inside jokes, he nagged Sherlock into eating and knew what a \u2018danger night\u2019 was \u2013 he\u2019d even created an empathic bond so he could know if Sherlock was in trouble.\u00a0 John could see why people would think that, but he still resented it.\nNot so much for the implication that he and Sherlock as a couple, but the assumption that he\u2019d be dating these women if they were.\u00a0 Okay, yeah, he\u2019d got around a bit in his younger days, but he did not cheat on people, thank you very much!\nAnd John was being absolutely sincere when he said he wasn\u2019t gay.\u00a0 His empathy meant that his relationship with sex and sexuality was\u2026complicated.\u00a0 He only felt sexual attraction if the person was\u2026well, empathically appealing was a good way to put it.\u00a0 If their empathic signature felt nice, then he felt attracted to them.\u00a0 If not, then sex with them \u2013 any kind of contact with them \u2013 was just unthinkable.\nThat was why he was attracted to Sherlock, but wasn\u2019t really comfortable calling himself gay.\u00a0 It was why he was attracted to Sarah and Jeanette and all the others, but couldn\u2019t call himself straight (even bisexual didn\u2019t cover it).\u00a0 It was also why he hadn\u2019t felt attracted to Irene in the slightest.\nOh, he could certainly see that she was physically beautiful, but it was like admiring a well-crafted doll \u2013 a cold, almost hollow sort of admiration.\nSherlock, on the other hand\u2026what he felt for Irene was a complex tangle of tangy admiration and flickering curiosity and strawberry fascination, with a sprinkling or two of lust.\u00a0 If John was perfectly honest with himself, he was more than a little jealous.\nBecause while Sherlock did care for him, John didn\u2019t arouse (arouse, ha!) his interest the way Irene had.\u2018Maybe I should have wandered naked around the flat now and again,\u2019 he thought, then shook his head.\nHe\u2019d been having a lot of these thoughts recently, wondering what it was about Irene that had managed to capture Sherlock\u2019s attention and interest so effectively.\u00a0 It was pointless, he knew, but he couldn\u2019t seem to help himself, like tonguing at a sore tooth.\nHe and Sherlock a couple?\nJohn would never be that lucky.\n--\nJohn knew he was staying out of sight for anything to do with Irene Adler, and he knew it was confusing Sherlock.\u00a0 John usually jumped into a case right alongside Sherlock, and even when he couldn\u2019t \u2013 like when he had to work or take care of Harry \u2013 he was at least curious about them.\nBut frankly, John just did not want to go anywhere near Irene.\nThe fact that she was clearly manipulating Sherlock like some kind of toy was only part of it.\u00a0 The fact that Sherlock was falling for it was\u2026alright, it was more significant than he\u2019d like to admit, but again, it was only part of it.\nIt was the pain.\u00a0 The never-ceasing pain that beat at him whenever she was nearby.\u00a0 After Sherlock had deciphered the code for her, John had retreated to his room for what he felt was a well-deserved lie-down (it was a pity painkillers wouldn\u2019t make any impression on this headache), until thirst drove him back to the kitchen.\n\u201cI think you\u2019re avoiding me,\u201d Irene declared as he stepped past her and Sherlock, intent on the kitchen and kettle there.\nHe doubted tea would help, but it was a psychosomatic thing \u2013 tea helped him calm down and relax, after all.\nHe felt Sherlock\u2019s curiosity spike, and John turned to give both of the geniuses a glance.\u00a0 After his experiences with Sherlock, he knew this was just Irene trying to put him off balance.\n\u201cKind of,\u201d he admitted, because he knew admittance was the best way to derail this kind of plan.\nIrene smirked, just a little, a brief feeling of triumph and smugness flashing over that paper mask like a sprinkling of ink and cloudy paint.\u00a0 \u201cIs it because you\u2019re jealous?\u201d\nSherlock wasn\u2019t saying a word, which would have told John how interested in the conversation he was even without feeling Sherlock\u2019s quicksilver fascination flow down the bond.\n\u201cNo,\u201d John said honestly.\nHe was jealous \u2013 one part of being an empath meant you were very good at recognising your own feelings, having seen them in others so often \u2013 but that wasn\u2019t why he was avoiding her.\nIrene laughed, low and throaty.\u00a0 \u201cOh come on, darling, you can be honest.\u00a0 It\u2019s just the three of us, after all.\u201d\nShe sent a flirtatious smile Sherlock\u2019s way, and John couldn\u2019t help marvelling at the tangled skein of her feelings for Sherlock.\u00a0 There was a sort of idle curiosity and a sense of prideful rivalry, but more than that, there was\u2026wistfulness.\u00a0 As though she wasn\u2019t truly interested in Sherlock, but wanted to be.\u00a0 Wanted something to fill that dark hole inside her, even if it was brief and based on deception and manipulation.\nJohn sighed, and gave Irene one of his gentlest smiles.\u00a0 \u201cWell, if we\u2019re being honest, I thought it would be easier on you.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t have to be an empath to know he\u2019d confused her.\u00a0 Confused Sherlock too, come to that, and John allowed himself a moment to revel in it.\n\u201cI thought it would be easier,\u201d he clarified.\u00a0 \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have to see us together.\u201d\nAt first, he\u2019d been puzzled, wondering exactly what kind of loss could have left that deep stain of grief on her for so long.\u00a0 And he probably would have remained puzzled if Irene hadn\u2019t come to their flat.\u00a0 But she\u2019d seen them talking and griping, had heard Sherlock\u2019s comment about John calling him amazing, and the each time John had been struck by flashes of jealousy and longing, like the slow drip of spilled wine.\u00a0 But it wasn\u2019t the kind of longing people felt when looking at something they couldn\u2019t have \u2013 it wasn\u2019t wistful and yearning but dark and bitter, the kind of longing people experienced when they had something and lost it.\nAnd then John had understood.\u00a0 Irene once had something like that \u2013 something like what he and Sherlock had.\u00a0 She\u2019d had someone who\u2019d laughed with her instead of at her, who\u2019d thought she was exceptional when everyone else thought she was a freak, who\u2019d known exactly who and what she was and loved her anyway\u2026and then she\u2019d lost them.\nNo wonder she didn\u2019t seem to give a damn about anyone or anything, including herself.\n\u201cI don\u2019t often admit to this, but you\u2019ve honestly stumped me, Dr. Watson,\u201d Irene said, still smiling.\u00a0 \u201cWhat exactly do you mean by that?\u201d\nShe clearly thought he was going to make some envy-ridden comment about her and Sherlock hooking up.\u00a0 Just because John knew why she was doing this \u2013 seemingly trying to push them together even as she made Sherlock dance to her tune \u2013 didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t resent it, just a little.\nBut she was a human being in pain, and John was a doctor first and foremost, so it wasn\u2019t malice that made him say, \u201cIt won\u2019t bring them back.\u201d\nIrene blinked, suddenly going perfectly still.\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhoever you lost,\u201d John said quietly, staring directly into her eyes.\u00a0 \u201cThis won\u2019t make it stop hurting.\u00a0 Trust me, I know.\u201d\nHe crossed the kitchen in three strides and pressed a hand to her shoulder in commiseration.\u00a0 Irene stared at him, and John knew that he\u2019d honestly caught her off-guard, that she was half-panicking as she wondered if she was really that transparent.\u00a0 He wanted to say something, to reassure her that he only figured it out because his brain didn\u2019t seem to work the way other people\u2019s did, but knew whatever he said would come out sounding like he was some kind of lunatic.\nSo he just kept his hand on her shoulder and looked straight in her eyes, trying to somehow communicate that he understood.\u00a0 Understood in a way he didn\u2019t really think Sherlock could.\nIt was just a hunch \u2013 it was empathy, not telepathy \u2013 but John suspected Sherlock had never lost anyone he really cared about.\u00a0 His parents were still alive, and John thought he didn\u2019t have enough contact with his extended family to really care if they were still alive or not.\nBut John had lost his parents, had come very close to losing Harry\u2026and he\u2019d lost Thomas.\u00a0 Correction, he\u2019d killed Thomas, so yes, John could understand.\nThis time, Irene\u2019s laugh was just a little too high, a little too quick to sound entirely natural.\u00a0 There was a measure of desperation in the way she shrugged his hand from her shoulder, as though she couldn\u2019t even contemplate accepting comfort.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve thought up, but I assure you, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d she stated, making a deliberate show of looking John in the eye.\n\u201cOf course I am,\u201d John said quietly, feeling his lips curl into a sad smile.\u00a0 \u201cJust ignore me.\u201d\n\u201cJohn\u2026\u201d Sherlock began, looking and feeling startled.\nBut the kettle had boiled, and John turned back to the kitchen without acknowledging Sherlock.\u00a0 He went through the motions of making tea, feeling Sherlock\u2019s confusion and concern and something tinged with soft purple admiration.\u00a0 For Irene?\u00a0 John thought it was the most likely explanation.\n\u201cI\u2019m going back upstairs,\u201d he said, not looking at either of them as he walked past.\nHe didn\u2019t think it was a coincidence that Irene left shortly after.\n--\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Sherlock demanded.\nJohn blinked, glancing up from his laptop.\u00a0 He was used to random outbursts while Sherlock was curled on the sofa and thinking, but this one was clearly directed at him rather than some phantom murderer or victim.\n\u201cHow did I know what?\u201d he frowned, unable to stop himself feeling a prickle of anxiety.\nSometimes he was convinced Sherlock was only inches away from discovering his empathy\u2026had he messed up somehow?\n\u201cHow did you know she\u2019d lost someone?\u201d Sherlock asked, staring at John with the kind of intensity he usually turned on corpses with no clear cause of death.\nOh, it was about Irene \u2013 John should have suspected.\u00a0 He could often guess when Sherlock\u2019s thoughts turned to her, because his emotions became strangely wistful and yearning, bright dew drops of admiration and affection and even a light trickle of fear, as though he were afraid of how strongly he\u2019d connected with her.\nIt was difficult to lie to Sherlock, so John settled for a half-truth.\u00a0 \u201cI knew because I\u2019ve lost people too \u2013 I can recognise the signs.\u201d\n\u201cWhat signs?\u201d\u00a0 Sherlock didn\u2019t sound scornful, but honestly curious, apparently eager to resolve this gap in his knowledge.\nJohn tried to come up with a way to express the inexpressible.\u00a0 \u201cWell, she was a thrill-seeker for one, but not the usual kind, and you come to know the types when you work in an emergency room.\u00a0 There are those who do dangerous or illegal things because it gives them a rush, there are those who do it just because they\u2019re idiots who\u2019ve seen it on the telly or something, and then there are those who do it because they need the thrill to stop them thinking, to make their mind concentrate on something other than what they\u2019ve lost.\u00a0 And while she wasn\u2019t suicidal, she wasn\u2019t terribly invested in her own survival \u2013 I expect if someone came to kill her, she wouldn\u2019t try to get out of it as hard as she could.\u00a0 She\u2019d try, yes, but it\u2019d probably be a half-hearted effort, just enough to justify it to herself.\u201d\nJohn expected Sherlock to have some kind of response to that \u2013 more about how caring wasn\u2019t an advantage or something \u2013 but Sherlock was silent.\u00a0 Silent and staring at John.\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d he said at last.\nThen he folded himself up on the sofa and didn\u2019t speak for the next six hours.\n--\nIt was strange, going to Dartmoor after spending so long in London.\u00a0 His empathy meant that being in London was like looking out at the city from their living room window.\u00a0 Up close you could distinguish the street lamps and lit windows, just as he could distinguish the separate emotions of individuals, but soon they all blurred into one sea of light, into a roiling ocean of pain and pleasure, joy and sorrow, hope and fear and everything in between.\nAnd Sherlock had called his mind \u2018placid\u2019?\u00a0 If only he knew.\nIn contrast, Dartmoor had long stretches of emptiness, and John\u2019s head went quiet for the first time in a very long time.\u00a0 Not silent, of course \u2013 he could still feel the people in the villages, and his bonds with Sherlock and Harry were still there \u2013 but quiet.\u00a0 Like someone had turned down the volume.\u00a0 The people were there, but\u2026distant.\u00a0 As though it was just him and Sherlock (and Harry, sort of), and no one else in the world.\nBut it couldn\u2019t last, and they were at the village before John really had time to appreciate it.\u00a0 The couple who ran The Cross Keys were nice, but guilt lurked beneath their cheerful veneer like a ribbon of blood through water.\u00a0 John snagged a receipt for meat, just in case it had something to do with their case.\nHe and Sherlock wound up with a single bed between them, but John didn\u2019t really mind; Sherlock probably wouldn\u2019t be doing much sleeping anyway.\nThough of course he objected when John put his case on the bed.\u00a0 \u201cWhy can\u2019t you take the sofa?\u00a0 You\u2019re shorter.\u201d\n\u201cOf the two of us, I\u2019m the one most likely to do some actual sleeping,\u201d John shot back, putting his toothbrush in the bathroom.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Sherlock grumbled.\n\u201cWell, if you happen to fancy some sleep, then we can share,\u201d John pointed out.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s certainly big enough for the two of us.\u00a0 But if you hog the covers or kick me in the night, I\u2019m dumping you on the floor.\u201d\nThere was a strange ripple of emotions from Sherlock at that, something longing and sad and strangely hopeful.\u00a0 John only got a brief glimpse before Sherlock deliberately smothered it \u2013 probably forcing himself to think about the case \u2013 and while John could probably probe the bond to determine what that had been, he felt his friend deserved some kind of privacy.\u00a0 John couldn\u2019t help knowing what he was feeling, but he could stop himself from poking his nose into subjects Sherlock obviously didn\u2019t want to think about.\n--\nFor the first time, John wondered if it was possible for an empathic bond to become too strong.\nHe\u2019d been able to follow Sherlock through the moor even when they lost sight of each other \u2013 that was one way in which the bond helped enormously, though it was a bit like playing hot-cold; John never got a clear picture of where Sherlock was, only a vague feeling of the direction he was in.\nJohn had stopped to write down what he thought was Morse Code, until he\u2019d probed with his empathy, picked up on the lust and love howling out into the night and realised it was people having sex in a car.\u00a0 Of course a place like Dartmoor would have several \u2018make-out points\u2019 \u2013 he was surprised they hadn\u2019t stumbled across one sooner.\nThen he\u2019d felt Sherlock\u2019s fear, and almost dropped his notebook in his hurry to find him.\nThe fear had been so strong, strong enough to start bleeding over into John.\u00a0 Even when they were back in front of the fire at the pub and perfectly safe, John could feel it creeping along his spine like a cold sweat.\u00a0 He\u2019d tried to nudge some feeling of security into Sherlock \u2013 carefully not touching him, because then they\u2019d have two people panicking \u2013 but the fear bubbling over into him made him shaky, not quite sure of himself.\u00a0 In the end he had to take a walk just to calm himself down.\nThat had never happened before.\u00a0 He was aware of other people\u2019s emotions, yes, and they could influence his own, but they never consumed him like that.\u00a0 Not even Harry\u2019s.\u00a0 Maybe it had something to do with his bond with Sherlock?\nIt was times like these that made John wish that he wasn\u2019t the only one, that there had been some older, more experienced empath for him to learn from.\u00a0 He had no idea why his bond with Sherlock would be stronger than the one he had with Harry.\u00a0 He had no idea why it seemed to be getting stronger with time.\u00a0 He had no idea about a lot of things, and he was getting a little sick of it.\nHe\u2019d been born with this damn empathy \u2013 shouldn\u2019t he know something about it by now?\n--\nSherlock didn\u2019t return to their room that night, but John hadn\u2019t really been expecting him to.\u00a0 He was feeling it again from Sherlock \u2013 the painful love and yearning that meant he was thinking about Irene \u2013 so he\u2019d probably be roaming around and brooding.\nJohn tried to stay up that night, tried to keep himself attuned to the bond between him and Sherlock so he\u2019d know if there was a problem\u2026but that intense fear had left him very tired, and eventually he succumbed to sleep.\nHe opened his eyes when he heard the door to the room shut softly.\u00a0 Usually, that sound would have had him leaping off the bed and grabbing for his gun, but his empathy told him it was Sherlock who\u2019d just entered the room, and John was so tired he couldn\u2019t be bothered to move.\u00a0 He shut his eyes again, already beginning to doze.\nIn the morning, when he awoke to an empty room, he\u2019d tell himself that the feeling of a hand stroking across his forehead \u2013 and the dull glow of love and longing that shuddered through the bond \u2013 had just been a dream.\n--\nIt was actually possible to lie to John \u2013 he\u2019d figured that one out fairly early.\u00a0 He was an empath, after all, not a telepath like in the sci-fi shows.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t know what people were thinking, only what they were feeling, and certainly not why they were feeling it.\u00a0 Most of the time, he could take a guess, but that was all it was \u2013 a guess.\nStill, his empathy helped him get a better read on people, and pushing fear onto someone was certainly useful when he was being threatened.\u00a0 The hardest part was controlling it, ensuring his own emotions and sense of self weren\u2019t consumed by the empathic noise that surrounded him.\nSo when his empathy suddenly started battering at his senses in Baskerville, John knew right away something was wrong.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t like those times when he got distracted and let his empathy drift free \u2013 he didn\u2019t feel weightless and barely aware of himself.\u00a0 If anything, he felt like he was aware of too much.\nHe was aware of Sherlock, yes \u2013 he was always aware of Sherlock \u2013 but suddenly he was aware of the people lingering on the outskirts of the facility, of their emotions bleeding into his and no matter how hard he focused, he couldn\u2019t shut them out.\u00a0 It was like all his barriers between himself and the world around him crumbled, emotions shattering through his mind like a broken window letting in a hurricane, a storm of thoughts and feelings that rushed by him and swept him up in the flood.\nIt was too much, far too much.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t block it, couldn\u2019t stem the tide, couldn\u2019t pick out individual people anymore and could barely pick out individual emotions. He was happy, and worried, and sad and confused and happy and angry and scared/triumphant/smug/anxiousexcited grievingguiltylovingcontentfrustrated-\nThen he was feeling nothing at all.\n--\nThere were voices\u2026somewhere.\u00a0 Above him, below him, to the side \u2013 John couldn\u2019t tell, but they were there.\u00a0 Sherlock and someone else, someone unfamiliar.\n\u201c-kind of dosage?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0 Sherlock sounded embarrassed.\n\u201cYou drugged him without knowing the dosage you were giving him?\u00a0 No wonder he had a reaction \u2013 for all we know, these are the typical symptoms of an overdose!\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t a helicopter come for him?\u201d\n\u201cBecause we have a jeep with the facilities of an ambulance and no time to waste waiting for other transport!\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Sherlock seemed to realise John was awake.\u00a0 \u201cJohn?\u00a0 John, are you alright?\u00a0 How are you feeling?\u201d\nBut John\u2019s brain apparently decided that if he was hearing and seeing, it was time for his empathy to wake up as well.\u00a0 Too wide, too loud, too bright, too\u2026everything.\nEmotions rose up to swallow him, and for a moment John could feel his brain trying to fight back, trying to hang on to what was him in the deluge of feelings and personalities that weren\u2019t his own.\nIt felt like he was being ripped apart on a molecular level, like every cell in his body was being pulled in a different direction.\u00a0 The human brain just wasn\u2019t built to process every emotion at once, not even John\u2019s.\nJohn had just enough time to wonder if he had any chance of coming out of this sane before the tide rose to engulf him, and he was gone.\n--\nThe next time John woke up, it was to the familiar sounds and smells of a hospital.\u00a0 Heart monitor, check.\u00a0 The bustle of nurses and doctors tending patients that they could never quite muffle, check.\u00a0 The scent of disinfectant, check.\nThe utter exhaustion that showed him he\u2019d been injured and was probably on a cocktail of drugs?\u00a0 Check.\nJohn wanted to open his eyes and take advantage of what he suspected would be a small window of lucidity, but he didn\u2019t risk it until he was certain his empathy was under control.\nThe doctor in the hall was flavoured with bitter worry and pinstriped self-doubt.\u00a0 Maybe she\u2019d made a misdiagnosis, or one of her patients wasn\u2019t responding to medication?\u00a0 The patient in the bed next to his was sapphire-happy with relief resounding over it like a trumpet blast.\u00a0 A successful surgery?\u00a0 The patient in the one over was asleep, drifting little soap bubbles of contentment and security over to John.\nAnd Sherlock was exuding blood-tinged worry and pus-smelling guilt through the bond, which was telling him Sherlock was close.\nJohn opened his eyes.\u00a0 The fluorescent lights were a little too bright, and he blinked several times before he felt it was safe to lift his head.\nSherlock was perched in a chair \u2013 literally perched, in that bird-of-prey-way he sometimes did.\u00a0 He was clearly aware John was awake; he\u2019d gone tense and wide-eyed, but he wasn\u2019t saying anything.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d John asked.\u00a0 Or at least, tried to ask \u2013 it emerged as a hoarse, painful croak instead.\nWhat was wrong with his throat?\n\u201cYou were screaming,\u201d Sherlock said quietly, obviously reading the question on John\u2019s face.\nJohn supposed that made sense.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t even been aware he was screaming, but then he hadn\u2019t even been aware of his own mind, let alone his body.\u00a0 He took a deep, uncomfortable breath and fought the urge to just close his eyes and drift back into unconsciousness.\n\u201cYou collapsed in the lab and started seizing,\u201d Sherlock went on, in the voice of someone who was trying for calm but not quite managing it.\u00a0 \u201cThey transported you out of the base and admitted you to the hospital fourteen hours ago.\u201d\nFourteen hours?\u00a0 That was\u2026a very long time.\n\u201cHenry?\u201d John rasped.\u00a0 Even that one word felt like an enormous effort.\n\u201cRecovering.\u00a0 You should have been there, John \u2013 it was brilliant!\u00a0 Murder weapon and scene of the crime all in one-\u201d\nJohn let himself tune out, giving in to the drugs and letting his body rest so he could heal\u2026whatever had happened.\u00a0 He had time to wonder one thing, though; what had set his empathy off like that?\n--\nWhen John woke for the third time, his mind felt much more his own \u2013 he was probably off the more potent drugs, then \u2013 and Sherlock was still there.\n\u201cHow long this time?\u201d he coughed.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been here for twenty-seven hours,\u201d Sherlock muttered, leaning over him and peering into his face in a way that would have made John uncomfortable if it was coming from anyone else.\nHe\u2019d got used to Sherlock\u2019s bizarre scrutiny, but it was the steadily-leaking guilt \u2013 now bitter and fermenting like rusted water \u2013 that was confusing John.\n\u201cHow\u2019d I get here?\u201d he asked, enjoying the way his words didn\u2019t slur and his mind was clear.\nSherlock explained in his usual lightning-fast way about some kind of drug that Franklin (Franklin, really?) had been dosing Henry with.\u00a0 There was a gas that was triggered by pressure pads in Dewer\u2019s Hollow.\n\u201c\u2026and some of the gas was leaking in the laboratory,\u201d Sherlock finished.\u00a0 \u201cYou started seizing.\u201d\nBut the guilt hadn\u2019t gone away, and Sherlock wasn\u2019t looking John in the eyes anymore.\n\u201cThe door was locked,\u201d John said slowly, a horrible idea taking form in his mind.\u00a0 But surely there were some lines even Sherlock wouldn\u2019t cross?\u00a0 Sherlock wouldn\u2019t...\n\u201cI thought it was in the sugar,\u201d Sherlock said quickly, shifting uncomfortably.\nIt was eerily similar to being shot.\u00a0 A moment of blinding pain, followed by numbness and spreading cold as blood poured out of him into the dirt.\nSherlock had tried to dose him with an unknown drug \u2013 thought he\u2019d succeeded, in fact \u2013 and locked him in the lab to observe its effects.\nSherlock had experimented on him.Sherlock had experimented on him.\nAnd if Sherlock did that for a case he\u2019d half-solved already, then what would he do if he found out John was an empath?\u00a0 Would he take it as permission to lock John up in a lab somewhere?\u00a0 Sherlock cared about him, yes, but clearly that caring didn\u2019t outweigh his curiosity about the effects of a drug that induced crippling fear and hallucinations.\u00a0 So what would Sherlock do if he ever learned about John\u2019s empathy?\nJohn honestly didn\u2019t know.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t know, and he didn\u2019t want to find out.\n--The lights were bright, too bright, and the distinctive smell of hospital disinfectant burned his nose.\u00a0 John pulled against the straps that held him down and swallowed hard, trying to repress his panic.Panicking wouldn\u2019t help him.\u00a0 Even his head was strapped down tightly, so all he could do was slide his eyes to the side to try to take in something besides the painfully white ceiling.Something in his chest jolted when he realised Sherlock was standing next to him, wearing surgical scrubs, gloves, and a mask.\u201cSherlock?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m coming, John.\u201d\u00a0 Sherlock\u2019s voice didn\u2019t sound quite right \u2013 tinny and distorted, as though it was coming through a cheap electronic speaker.Still, it was undoubtedly Sherlock, and John was just starting to feel reassured when Sherlock picked up a long, thin metal needle and a small hammer.He reached out automatically with his empathy\u2026but there was nothing.\u00a0 He kept reaching, scrabbling for the bond, feeling panic mount as Sherlock came closer.\u201cSherlock, what are you doing?\u201d\u00a0 And John wasn\u2019t panicking, he wasn\u2019t.But then he most certainly was panicking, because Sherlock was bending over him, lining up the end of the needle with the corner of his eye, the precise spot where a sharp tap with the hammer would drive it through bone and flesh and into his brain.\u00a0 The exact procedure to perform a lobotomy.\u201cSherlock?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Sherlock said, raising the hammer, the needle just beginning to prick the tender blood vessels around John\u2019s eye, no matter how much he tried to blink the pressure away.\u00a0 \u201cLaboratory conditions, I promise.\u201dThe hammer came down.\nAnd John woke up with an unpleasant jolt, the corner of his eye still prickling and burning, half-expecting fluorescent lights and white tiles.\u00a0 But the room was dark, and John remembered being released from the hospital, remembered the advice Stapleton had given him from the little information they had on reactions to the drug, remembered the trip back to Baker Street as he\u2019d leaned his head against the window and ignored Sherlock\u2019s faltering attempts at conversation.\nJohn sat up and rubbed at his eye, trying to focus on the dull wallpaper and pull his mind away from Harry\u2019s emotions, just in case the headache was coming from her.\nIt wasn\u2019t, but it could have been, judging by the nauseous-green anger and paper-brittle unhappiness that was radiating through her bond.\u00a0 John needed to remember to call her in the morning.\nSherlock was downstairs, practically bubbling with curdled misery and burnt self-righteousness, slathered with more of that sour-blue guilt.\nJohn would have liked to think all that was about him, but who really knew?\u00a0 He had a direct insight into Sherlock\u2019s emotions, and that wasn\u2019t enough to tell him when Sherlock was about to experiment on him, so he certainly wasn\u2019t capable of teasing out something as complex as that.\nJohn turned over and shut his eyes, but then had to open them again just to remind himself that he was actually in his bed and not a laboratory.\u00a0 Which was ridiculous \u2013 he could feel the difference between his mattress and a steel table, thank you very much \u2013 but he needed to see it.\nLogically, he knew it was just a nightmare \u2013 god knew, he\u2019d had enough of them to last him a lifetime.\u00a0 He knew it was just the toxin working its way out of his system.\u00a0 He knew it was just his subconscious twisting half-formed and ridiculous fears so they seemed like real threats.\nBut John didn\u2019t go to sleep for the rest of the night.\n--\nIn the morning, John went down for toast automatically, even though he didn\u2019t feel hungry.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want toast,\u201d Sherlock pointed out from the sofa.\n\u201cI don\u2019t actually want much of anything,\u201d John said, pleased his voice was much calmer than he actually felt.\u00a0 \u201cBut eating something, especially toast, can help toxins work out of my system.\u00a0 Well, burnt toast is best, but I\u2019m not eating burnt toast.\u201d\n\u201cLoss of appetite isn\u2019t one of the symptoms,\u201d Sherlock said, sounding almost peeved.\nJohn nodded agreeably.\u00a0 \u201cTrue, it\u2019s not in the list Dr Stapleton gave me.\u201d\u00a0 And that Sherlock had undoubtedly appropriated for his own perusal at some point.\u00a0 \u201cBut they\u2019re dealing with a limited sample size and I had a very extreme reaction.\u00a0 They think it\u2019s done its damage, but I\u2019m under strict orders to call them if there\u2019s any change in case it does end up killing me.\u201d\nSherlock made a funny noise, and woodsmoke-fear suddenly made the bond hum.\n\u201cBut you already knew that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d John sighed, forcing down the last bite he could manage and tossing the half-eaten meal in the rubbish.\u00a0 \u201cYou know my charts, and you\u2019ve read the list Dr Stapleton gave you.\u00a0 Which means that you also know that being thrown into a seizure indicates that I\u2019m responding very differently than any other subject studied.\u00a0 It could just be an overdose but that doesn\u2019t seem likely, given the speed of my recovery.\u201d\nJohn should stop talking.\u00a0 He knew he should, but he couldn\u2019t clamp down on the bitterness that wanted to spew forth like vomit.\u00a0 \u201cLook, I\u2019ll tell you if I feel the urge to commit suicide, but for now, I need to indulge my PTSD.\u00a0 Which means staying in my room for the day, convincing myself I\u2019m properly defended and trying to sleep to make up for the night of horrendous nightmares.\u201d\nOf which Sherlock had often been the star, but John wasn\u2019t quite cruel enough to mention that.\nBut he was cruel enough to abandon his pretence at nonchalance and go on the attack.\u00a0 \u201cWhat did you think was going to happen, Sherlock?\u00a0 Because I\u2019m honestly curious.\u201d\nSherlock hissed like an angry cat.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t actually dose you-\u201d\n\u201cBut you intended to!\u201d John snapped.\u00a0 \u201cYou know I\u2019ve been diagnosed with PTSD and you intended to feed me a drug designed to induce utter terror!\u00a0 What was your plan if I snapped on the spot and tried to kill myself?\u00a0 Or someone else?\u00a0 If I\u2019d ended up in a mental institution, that would have been okay, would it?\u00a0 Or if you\u2019d overdosed me and I went into cardiac arrest?\u201d\n\u201cI made a mistake!\u201d\u00a0 Sherlock shouted.\u00a0 \u201cIs that what you want to hear?\u00a0 I made a mistake and I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly!\u201d\nJohn had taken a deep breath to shout back when it suddenly faltered in his throat, the memory of his own mistake with Thomas rushing up to choke him.\u00a0 He still wanted to yell at Sherlock, but he no longer had the energy.\nSo he turned around and walked out of the kitchen.\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Sherlock asked, sounding alarmed.\n\u201cUpstairs to my room,\u201d John said wearily.\u00a0 \u201cWeren\u2019t you listening?\u201d\nHe spent the rest of the day trying to read, watching the sunlight track across the wall and trying to convince himself he was safe.\n--\nThe next day Sherlock was still smoke-buzzing nervous and thorn-prick guilty, tentative in the strange way he had that meant he\u2019d clear his throat before speaking and wouldn\u2019t slam cupboard doors just to get attention.\nJohn made him a cup of tea, trying to return to some semblance of their usual routine.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t quite sure if this was an olive branch or just him being too weary to keep holding a grudge, but Sherlock certainly took it as a sign that his not-quite-apology was accepted.\u00a0 By the afternoon, he was back to bashing around the kitchen like a scientifically-inclined elephant.\nBut John didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever entertain the idea of telling Sherlock about his empathy again.\n--\nJohn supposed it was almost inevitable, really.\u00a0 With all the cases Sherlock took, he was bound to stumble over some famous ones eventually.\u00a0 He already had, come to think of it.\nBut never anything quite so famous as the Reichenbach Falls painting, or so many in such quick succession.\u00a0 It was ominous, mainly because John knew how the media worked \u2013 one month\u2019s darling was next month\u2019s scapegoat, and John honestly didn\u2019t have the time, energy or inclination to deal with that.\u00a0 Media attention tended to be poisonous.\nOn top of that, Sherlock was feeling sad almost all the time now, which was strange and very disheartening.\u00a0 The intensity ebbed and flowed \u2013 not like a tide, because tides were predictable, but more like\u2026actually John didn\u2019t have an appropriate simile there.\u00a0 Because nothing came close to describing the seemingly inexplicable surges in misery that gripped Sherlock day and night.\nJohn couldn\u2019t figure out the pattern to it.\u00a0 It had to be there, he knew \u2013 emotions didn\u2019t come out of nowhere, Sherlock was responding to something, he just didn\u2019t know what.\nHe seemed happier when he was with John, and John couldn\u2019t deny that left him feeling a bit chuffed.\u00a0 But then he\u2019d say or do something and Sherlock\u2019s mood would deflate so suddenly it was actually rather frightening.\u00a0 Especially because there was no outward sign of it.\u00a0 Sherlock didn\u2019t frown, didn\u2019t get the dejected expression that usually meant there was nothing but boring cases on the horizon.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t do anything \u2013 if it weren\u2019t for his empathy, John would never know there was something wrong.\nBut he did know, and the fact that he couldn\u2019t figure it out was driving him a bit mad.\u00a0 Sherlock would be sitting in the kitchen, trying to get rid of whatever toxic waste his latest experiment had produced at John\u2019s shouted behest and then suddenly everything would go wrong.\nThey\u2019d been arguing about\u2026John actually couldn\u2019t remember exactly what he\u2019d said.\u00a0 The usual about hygiene and food preparation surfaces and Sherlock retaliating with his spiel that essentially boiled down to \u2018it\u2019s for science, so you should let me do anything I like\u2019.\u00a0 (John had a lot less tolerance for that one after Baskerville.)\nSherlock hadn\u2019t been shouting, but he had been pouting \u2013 the expression he used when he was feeling oppressed.\u00a0 \u201cYour obsession with cleanliness and antibacterial soap is really quite unbecoming for a medical man \u2013 aren\u2019t you supposed to be warning people about the dangers of superbugs?\u00a0 After all, you\u2019re forever lecturing me about every other danger.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d miss me if I was gone,\u201d John tossed back.\nAnd just like that, Sherlock\u2019s emotions spilled sorrow like red ink, splattering across the steady scrolling of his thoughts and tainting everything.\nJohn could admit he tended to nudge Sherlock\u2019s mood a little if it got too bad \u2013 when the storm clouds broke and bled rain-thick sorrow, lightning-sharp worry, thunder-crashing bitterness and a slow howl of loss \u2013 but it was a palliative, not a cure.\u00a0 The brief burst of lightness would be matched by an even more dramatic dip, and John didn\u2019t feel comfortable meddling beyond that.\u00a0 Sherlock had a right to\u2026.whatever this was.\u00a0 Maybe something to do with Irene?\nGradually John sussed out that Sherlock seemed especially unhappy when John mentioned something about going away or missing something, but that didn\u2019t make any sense.\u00a0 Did Sherlock have some kind of terminal illness?\n\u201cYou do know you can tell me anything?\u201d John hazarded as he passed Sherlock while Sherlock was doing\u2026something with his laptop.\u00a0 \u201cIf you were in trouble, or something?\u201d\nHe was watching Sherlock closely in his peripheral vision, which was the only reason he saw the way Sherlock looked utterly stricken.\u00a0 It was only for a moment, but it was there.\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m in trouble,\u201d Sherlock stated, in the tone of voice that somehow made a statement into a scornful question of, \u2018how could you be that stupid?\u2019\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been sad lately,\u201d John said quietly.\n\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d\u00a0 Again, there was no hint of defensiveness, but John hadn\u2019t really expected any \u2013 Sherlock was a better actor than that.\n\u201cI\u2019m not like you Sherlock, I can\u2019t list off all the things I\u2019ve noticed,\u201d John shrugged.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026something I know.\u201d\n\u201cJust something you know?\u201d Sherlock repeated, but his voice was softer now.\nPhysical contact was always a bit dicey \u2013 sometimes Sherlock seemed to need it, sometimes he\u2019d practically flinch away \u2013 but John took a risk and put his hand on Sherlock\u2019s shoulder. \u00a0Sherlock twitched like he wanted to lean into it and leap away at the same time, but both motions had equalised into a kind of spasm that didn\u2019t actually move him anywhere.\nWhen there was no other reaction John squeezed Sherlock\u2019s shoulder and then drew back.\u00a0 Sherlock didn\u2019t say anything, or do anything, and his expression didn\u2019t change.\u00a0 His emotions were tense and roiling, sunburst-gratitude and wine-sharp bitterness and a low drumming of\u2026regret?\nJohn had no idea if he\u2019d helped or not, but at least he\u2019d tried.\n--\nJohn didn\u2019t like going into the courtroom.\u00a0 The idea of seeing Jim Moriarty get his comeuppance was certainly an appealing one, even if Sherlock thought it was unlikely, but that ever-present emptiness \u2013 the emptiness he was now making no effort to disguise \u2013 was as sickening and gut-wrenching and wrong as ever.\nExcept Moriarty didn\u2019t get his comeuppance.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t even get convicted, which was\u2026well, John couldn\u2019t lie and say surprising, but it was certainly unsettling.\u00a0 Frightening, even. \u00a0If Moriarty could do something that blatant, be caught in the act and still get away then what hope did they have of ever catching him?\nOf course, that was assuming they were going to catch him.\u00a0 John should probably worry what it said about him that he was perfectly prepared to shoot Moriarty in cold blood, because that was exactly what he was half-planning to do.\u00a0 But he didn\u2019t feel the slightest flicker of conscience about it, probably because what Mycroft had said about the battlefield was true \u2013 this was war, and in war, you shot to kill.\nIt didn\u2019t help that Sherlock was frightened.\u00a0 A soft, creeping sort of fear that twisted at the edges of John\u2019s senses like roots sneaking in beneath a door \u2013 thin but strong, smelling like earth and decay.\u00a0 It put John on edge, though in all honesty he couldn\u2019t swear that he wouldn\u2019t have punched the Chief Superintendent even without that constant, nails-on-chalkboard frustration.\nStill, at least it was satisfying, even if it did end with him arrested and he and Sherlock on the run.\n\u201cWell, what stage of Moriarty\u2019s plan is this?\u201d John asked after Sherlock had picked the lock on that reporter\u2019s flat.\nSherlock lunged forward like he wanted to turn the place upside down in search of\u2026whatever he wanted to look for, but John stopped and set his weight as soon as they were through the door.\u00a0 The handcuff chewed into his wrist as Sherlock came up short against the restraint and actually came close to toppling over, flailing his long limbs and making a huffy, disgruntled noise like a cat that had just been stepped on.\nJohn let himself enjoy it for a moment \u2013 it was rare to see Sherlock uncoordinated, and those moments were to be treasured \u2013 then took advantage of his imbalance to yank Sherlock down onto the couch as John sat down.\nSherlock was bristling, like he was offended somehow.\u00a0 \u201cWe need to-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting down,\u201d John interrupted, his voice calm and controlled.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve got a headache.\u201d\nHe\u2019d tried to ensure the police hesitated to follow him by pushing as much fear onto them as he could, and it had been a long time since he\u2019d tried to target a crowd.\u00a0 John wasn\u2019t sure if that was the reason his head was pounding in time with his heartbeat \u2013 it could be adrenaline or fear or any number of things, really \u2013 but it was the reason he was using.\nAt least it was dark.\u00a0 John shut his eyes and took a deep breath, trying to centre himself.\u00a0 He tried to relax his hold on his empathy and just let himself float on the emotions that leaked from Sherlock and Harry and the people in the surrounding apartments \u2013 his own form of meditation.\nIt was broken when Sherlock spoke, the bond suddenly twitching with damp worry, \u201cDid they hit you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cDid the police hit you?\u201d Sherlock repeated.\n\u201cWhy would they hit me?\u201d John asked.\u00a0 \u201cI mean, I didn\u2019t exactly resist arrest.\u201d\n\u201cYou struck their lord and master, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some of the plebeians went in for a bit of police brutality before they brought you down.\u00a0 And you haven\u2019t answered me \u2013 did they hit you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d John sighed.\u00a0 \u201cNo one hit me.\u00a0 The headache\u2019s from\u2026something else.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u00a0 That\u2019s\u2026good.\u201d\nThe back of Sherlock\u2019s fingers were resting against John\u2019s leg.\u00a0 John took his hand, because they were handcuffed fugitives and he needed to touch him and if Sherlock didn\u2019t like it he could bloody well say so.\u00a0 But Sherlock didn\u2019t pull away \u2013 on the contrary, he turned his hand over and gripped back, squeezing a little tighter than John was expecting.\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s Moriarty\u2019s end game?\u201d John asked into the darkness.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t opened his eyes.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0 Sherlock\u2019s voice was calm and contemplative, and it was a masterful performance.\nJohn knew it was a performance because silvery, toxic dread and frothing fear trumpeted across the bond.\u00a0 If Sherlock had been telling the truth, if he really didn\u2019t know Moriarty\u2019s end game, then there would have been some metallic excitement or something that showed how eager he was to figure it all out, but there was just fear.\u00a0 And dread.\n\u201cLiar,\u201d John said wearily.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re frightened, so it must be bad.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Sherlock snapped.\u00a0 No instant denial or scoffing \u2013 he must be really fraying at the edges.\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I do.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but how do you know?\u201d\u00a0 Sherlock hissed.\u00a0 \u201cHow do you always know?\u00a0 With everyone?\u201d\nJohn shrugged and repeated himself.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s what I do.\u201d\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly something I can explain.\u201d\u00a0 Or felt prepared to, after Baskerville.\nSherlock exhaled harshly through his nose \u2013 not exactly a huff or a sigh, but certainly an expression of petulance.\n\u201cSo\u2026what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d John pressed.\nSherlock was silent for a disturbing amount of time.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s fine, John.\u00a0 It will all be\u2026fine.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be alright.\u201d\nThat sounded far too final for John.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t really care whether I\u2019m alright or not.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d Sherlock said.\nJohn was having trouble recognising what Sherlock was feeling.\u00a0 It felt like toughened wood, fibrous and hardened by rough weather with streaks of tar-scented bitumen.\u00a0 He\u2019d never felt anything like this from Sherlock before.\u00a0 Was it\u2026resolve?\u00a0 Determination?\u00a0 They weren\u2019t really emotions, but John didn\u2019t know how else to describe it.\nHe was so wrapped up in trying to unpick what he was feeling from Sherlock that it took Sherlock stiffening beside him to make him realise that Kitty Reilly was approaching.\n--\nAt least Sherlock finally picked the lock on their handcuffs, though John wondered why he\u2019d left them on so long.\nJohn was so involved in the argument with Kitty (and trying to somehow mitigate the sheer, sharp-varnish desperation that was hissing from Sherlock like steam) that he completely missed Moriarty\u2019s approach.\u00a0 He felt it when Moriarty was right outside the flat, of course \u2013 that emptiness couldn\u2019t be missed up close \u2013 but he only had enough time to tense and regret that Sherlock hadn\u2019t kept the gun.\nThe door opened and Moriarty strode in, the very picture of the tired but devoted boyfriend.\u00a0 John stood there, feeling as though he were rooted to the ground, watching Moriarty babble and plead as though he were the innocent one, as though Sherlock was the one who should be in jail, and the force of his anger and indignation literally took his breath away.\u00a0 It washed out into the room like a tide of stinging light, and he dimly felt Kitty and Sherlock twitch with it but all his focus was on Moriarty and the sucking hole that ate those emotions as if they\u2019d never been.\nJohn stepped forward, gathered every scrap of fear and despair he could, dredging up memories of his worst nightmares and worst experiences and shoved it at Moriarty, hard.\u00a0 He tried to power it on the force of his hatred alone, and pushed more and more until it felt like he was dragging his guts out through his mouth.\u00a0 He pushed hard enough to send a dozen people running for cover.\nAnd it didn\u2019t work.\u00a0 The emptiness took everything \u2013 everything \u2013 and left John wavering on his feet, suddenly as tired as if he\u2019d run twenty kilometres through the hot sun in full gear.\nIt didn\u2019t work.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t work, and John had no idea what he was supposed to do next.\nAnd then Sherlock buggered off to do something important all on his own, but at least John got to rant at Mycroft.\n--\nPerhaps calling Sherlock a \u2018machine\u2019 was a bit of a low blow, especially when John could feel the evidence to the contrary, but he just wanted some kind of reaction from the man.\u00a0 Anything other than this low-level sadness and percolating guilt that had been gnawing at John through the bond, and he barely reacted to the news that Mrs. Hudson had been shot.\nOf course, it was only when John saw Sherlock on the roof \u2013 his fear and distress and guilt and pain loud and bright as a beacon \u2013 that he realised why there\u2019d been no reaction.\nSherlock must have known it wasn\u2019t true.\u00a0 He\u2019d known, and he\u2019d let John go anyway.\nNot for the first time, John reflected that this empathy thing would have been a lot more useful if it made it impossible to lie to him.\nAt first, he had no idea what was happening, and then Sherlock said it was his note and no, no, this had to be some kind of cruel joke.\u00a0 Sherlock couldn\u2019t be talking about\u2026\nJohn pushed every single particle of joy and purpose, happiness and contentment and love (yes, love) \u2013 every positive emotion Sherlock had ever made him feel \u2013 through the bond, trying to give Sherlock a change of heart, trying to make him think twice.\nIt didn\u2019t work.\n--\nJohn knew he was in shock.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t fight the blanket that draped across his shoulders, didn\u2019t acknowledge the paramedics that buzzed around him like midges, poking at the deep bruise on the side of his head.\nIt had to be the concussion.\u00a0 John\u2019s brain had been rattled, that was why nothing made sense.\u00a0 A short trip to the hospital, and everything would get sorted out, and then he\u2019d understand.\nHe\u2019d seen Sherlock die.\nBut the bond was still there.\u00a0 It was crawling with guilt and fear and pain, but it was still there, as though it were echoing the last impressions he\u2019d received from Sherlock.\u00a0 John wondered numbly if this was what it was like to have a phantom limb.\nIt was insane, it was crazy \u2013 John had finally snapped.\u00a0 Sherlock was dead (oh Christ, Sherlock was dead, dead and never coming back), and if his empathy was going to thrum with Sherlock\u2019s feelings just before he\u2019d suicided for the rest of his life, then John was going to ensure the rest of his life was very short.\u00a0 He had a gun, after all.\nJohn closed his eyes and leaned against the frame of the ambulance \u2013 which the paramedics didn\u2019t like and they started urging him to open his eyes.\u00a0 But John wouldn\u2019t; he was looking inwards, looking at the bond and willing it to stop, to just stop, to shut up because Sherlock was dead and dead men didn\u2019t feel emotions.\nUnless he was feeling consistent proof of the afterlife, and at that thought John actually laughed.\u00a0 Laughed and laughed until there were tears in his eyes and streaming down his face.\u00a0 Laughed until he bent over and vomited on his shoes.\nFear and guilt surged through the bond, as if Sherlock had somehow seen John do that, and John shoved comfort and love at the link in a last-ditch attempt to get it to shut up, to wink out or do whatever it was supposed to do\u2026\nAnd the bond responded.\u00a0 The fear eased, and the guilt didn\u2019t vanish but solidified somehow, like a bad decision made for the right reasons.\nAnd then John knew.\nSherlock was alive.\nbreak (verb)\n1. separate into pieces as a result of a blow, shock or strain.\n2. interrupt (a continuity, sequence or course).\n--\nJohn felt numb.\u00a0 Sherlock was alive, but had pretended to commit suicide.\u00a0 In front of John.\nBut why?\nJohn knew Sherlock wasn\u2019t exactly normal, and was capable of a lot of cruelty through sheer indifference, but he wasn\u2019t cruel enough to do something like this without a purpose.\u00a0 The only mystery was what that purpose could be.\nJohn told himself to keep calm and carry on \u2013 he\u2019d understand soon enough.\u00a0 Sherlock would contact him, tell him what the plan was, and then they\u2019d figure everything out.\u00a0 Together.\nThough Sherlock better have a bloody good excuse for traumatising him like that.\u00a0 John knew he was alive \u2013 the bond told him that much \u2013 but that didn\u2019t mean the memory of watching him fall and then apparently lying dead on the pavement wasn\u2019t giving John nightmares.\nThe funeral had been an exercise in agony.\u00a0 Misery and grief permeated everything like smoke, oily and acidic like burning paint or plastics.\u00a0 John had a headache all through the service, and he couldn\u2019t even look at Mrs Hudson and Lestrade \u2013 their emotions were bad enough.\nHe wanted to go up to them and tell them it was okay, that Sherlock was alive, but he didn\u2019t dare.\u00a0 There had to be a reason Sherlock had done\u2026what he\u2019d done.\u00a0 There had to be a purpose to it, and John wasn\u2019t going to risk ruining it.\nJohn was waiting.\u00a0 Sherlock would contact him, and tell him the plan.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t leave John to suffer this alone.\n--\nBy the third day, when John felt Sherlock\u2019s signature getting more remote \u2013 showing that he was moving away \u2013 he started to admit to himself that maybe Sherlock was leaving him.\u00a0 That he\u2019d pretended to kill himself in front of John and now he was leaving.\nJohn didn\u2019t understand.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t understand why Sherlock had pretended to kill himself.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t understand why Sherlock had made him watch.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t understand why Sherlock wasn\u2019t communicating with him.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t understand why Sherlock was leaving.\nHe didn\u2019t understand anything.\nJohn made himself sit down and think it through.\u00a0 He was no Sherlock, but he wasn\u2019t an idiot, either.\nSherlock had pretended to commit suicide, and was now leaving London at the very least, judging by what John was feeling, if not the UK itself.\u00a0 Given that Sherlock wasn\u2019t dead, John felt he could ignore Sherlock\u2019s \u2018note\u2019 as a lie.\u00a0 The whole \u2018research\u2019 thing had been bollocks anyway \u2013 what kind of research would have told him Harry was an alcoholic but left him with the impression she was a man?\nMoriarty hadn\u2019t been heard from since they\u2019d found him in that reporter\u2019s flat.\u00a0 Not even to threaten or gloat that he\u2019d won.\u00a0 It was almost as if he\u2019d gone away\u2026\nLike Sherlock had.Alone protects me.\nAnd just like that, John understood.\u00a0 Sherlock was leaving, and his fake death had been his way of ensuring no one would come after him.\nNot even John.\n--\nEveryone thought he was in mourning, and in a way, John guessed he was.\u00a0 He was in mourning for the friend he\u2019d thought he had.\nBecause Sherlock could be an arse, and cruel and dismissive, yes, but John had thought that Sherlock cared for him.\u00a0 That Sherlock thought he was useful, if only as back-up muscle.\u00a0 That Sherlock had trusted him.\nApparently, he\u2019d been wrong.\nIt was a heavy blow, and John was enough of an adult to admit that he didn\u2019t take it well.\u00a0 It felt like the night Mary told him she was in love, and it wasn\u2019t with him \u2013 a sudden tilt in his worldview that threw everything into a whole new light.\u00a0 Sherlock had been worried at the pool, but maybe he\u2019d been worried because he thought he\u2019d been wrong.\u00a0 There was that thing about John being a \u2018conductor of light\u2019, but maybe he\u2019d only said that because he\u2019d needed to make up with John so he could have a test subject for the supposedly-poisoned sugar.\nThis was worse than Mary.\u00a0 Because Sherlock had been the centre of his life.\nAnd that had been his mistake.\nMaybe if Sherlock had actually died, John could have stayed in Baker Street and grieved quietly, supported by Mrs Hudson and Lestrade and everyone who\u2019d known Sherlock.\u00a0 But knowing that Sherlock had tricked him, that he had never really trusted him or considered him a friend, John just couldn\u2019t do it.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t see any of his friends mourn (though they\u2019d been Sherlock\u2019s friends first, and that was part of John\u2019s problem) without wanting to tell them that it was a lie, that Sherlock was just using them all.\nWell, except Molly.\u00a0 John didn\u2019t feel any urge to tell her because she already knew.\nJohn wasn\u2019t a genius \u2013 he knew that about himself.\u00a0 He had difficulty knowing why people were lying to him, assuming he even knew they were lying in the first place.\u00a0 But this was one of the exceptions.\nHe knew Molly was lying to him almost from the first moment he saw her after\u2026just after.\u00a0 Guilt and fear were practically steaming off her, though to most people it probably would have looked like grief combined with some social awkwardness.\nJohn had known better.\u00a0 He had known Sherlock was alive, and going by what he was getting from Molly, he was fairly certain she had a role in the staged suicide.\nHe\u2019d had to walk away from her before he yelled at her.\u00a0 Before he asked her if Sherlock had told her why he didn\u2019t trust John, why John hadn\u2019t merited being let in on the plan.\nHe might have hated Molly under different circumstances, but she looked and felt so wretched with guilt that all he felt for her was compassion.\nNot so Mycroft.\nMycroft was putting on a good show of a man tightly controlled but cracking at the edges with grief, and John was pretty sure it was fooling everyone.\u00a0 Anyone who got close to him at the funeral started getting sympathy sprinkled through their emotions like drops of warm rain, but John could feel that there was no trace of grief in Mycroft.\u00a0 There was something there \u2013 a flickering shadow of loss, like the intermittent pull of a malfunctioning vacuum \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t grief, not really.\nOf course Mycroft had been involved.\u00a0 The geniuses had hatched a plan on their own \u2013 god forbid they ever consider the mere mortals.\nBut John didn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0 Because if Sherlock and Mycroft were really bringing down Moriarty, that was more important than screaming at them about being cold, crazy bastards who thought everything was about one-upping everyone else.\u00a0 No matter how much he wanted to.\nSo John moved out.\u00a0 Because he needed to move on.\n--\nExcept he couldn\u2019t.\u00a0 Move on, that was, because he\u2019d gone and bonded himself to Sherlock like the idiot he so clearly was.\u00a0 Even when he determinedly ignored the bond, refused to probe for insight into Sherlock\u2019s emotional state, it was still there, pulsing quietly in the background.\u00a0 Like white noise, except your brain got used to white noise and could ignore it, but John had never managed to just ignore a bond.\u00a0 It was part of him, and it was like trying to ignore his hands \u2013 you might not consciously think about them, but you were never unaware of them.\nClearly, he needed to break the bond before he was going to get anywhere.\nExcept he couldn\u2019t.\u00a0 Not couldn\u2019t as in \u2018couldn\u2019t manage it\u2019, but couldn\u2019t as in \u2018had no idea how to\u2019.\nJohn supposed he should have expected this. \u00a0He had no real idea how he\u2019d created the bond in the first place, and he\u2019d never tried to break his bond with Harry.\u00a0 He\u2019d formed the bond when he just kind of\u2026pushed emotion at Sherlock, and something had snagged.\u00a0 He\u2019d been trying to push all his emotions \u2013 all of himself \u2013 so maybe the opposite would work?\u00a0 Pulling himself away from Sherlock, the same way he tried to pull pain away from people he was healing?\nHe tried to pull himself away from the bond.\u00a0 Like leaning away, except in his brain.\nIt didn\u2019t work.\u00a0 John didn\u2019t even get a headache or a twinge from the bond, which would have told him it was at least doing something.\u00a0 There was no change at all.\nThe worst part was that John wasn\u2019t even sure if that was because he was doing it the wrong way or because he needed another tactic entirely.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t as though there were instructions he could consult.\nSo John embarked on some experimentation.\n--\nHe tried visualising the bond as some kind of rope or chain, and then he visualised cutting it.\nThat didn\u2019t work.\nHe tried to smother it, to bury it, to shove it into the back of his head and starve it.\nThat didn\u2019t work, either.\nHe tried alcohol, but that only blotted his empathy out when he got to the stage where he couldn\u2019t walk straight.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t feel the bond, true, but John had no desire to pick up Harry\u2019s bad habits, so he chalked that one up to a failure as well.\nHe tried marijuana, but he still felt the bond.\u00a0 The drug just made him not care that he felt it.\nHe bought self-help books that talked about meditation and \u2018opening the mind to the energies of the universe\u2019 and such.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t help either.\nJohn even made a neat little list, complete with checkboxes:Visualisation [x]\u2018Pulling\u2019 [x]Alcohol [x]Marijuana [x]Meditation [x]Calming the mind [x]Haloperidol [x]Clozapine [x]Brain surgery [ ]\nMorphine was no help \u2013 John remembered that from when he\u2019d been shot \u2013 so he\u2019d considered cocaine.\u00a0 But cocaine tended to increase sociability and only began to induce numbness and blunting emotions after you\u2019d been using it for a while, so he didn\u2019t think that was a good idea.\nThe antipsychotics were a bit of a stretch and a definite abuse of his hospital contacts, but John had been hopeful.\u00a0 After all, if they helped schizophrenics cope with delusions then maybe they could help him cope with the bond.\u00a0 But they only made him feel tired and listless.\nJohn could create the bond, but he couldn\u2019t destroy it.\nThere was a final option he hadn\u2019t explored: brain surgery, or more specifically, neural destruction.\u00a0 He\u2019d have to get one of those fancy imaging scans that showed which parts of the brain were active at what point in time, use those to narrow down which part of his brain dealt with the bond, then just burn that little cluster of neurons and hopefully kill the bond.\u00a0 Of course, it would take years, cost a fortune and John had a better than average chance of ending up brain-damaged in a way he wasn\u2019t expecting, so he didn\u2019t really consider that a feasible option.\u00a0 He wrote it down anyway.\nHe put the list up on his fridge with a souvenir magnet they\u2019d brought home from Dartmoor.\u00a0 The pub had a collection of silly things like that \u2013 stuffed toys and bottle openers and the like \u2013 and John had never been sure if Sherlock had actually bought the magnet or if he\u2019d nicked it like he had the ashtray from Buckingham Palace.\u00a0 Sherlock had just given it to him when they were driving back to London and at the time, John had taken it as another half-arsed apology.\u00a0 But now he was wondering if Sherlock had just lifted it when he was anxious (probably as some bizarre way to calm himself down) and needed someone to pawn it off to.\nJohn was settling into bed and wondering if he\u2019d have any luck with combining his strategies (maybe if he took Clozapine and then tried the visualisation trick?) when the bond suddenly twitched.\u00a0 John had been doing his best to ignore it, but he was starting to feel\u2026was that pain?\nPaying attention to the bond was his big mistake.\u00a0 Pain flared along his left arm, concentrated in the wrist, and John \u2013 unthinkingly \u2013 reached for the pain and drew it into himself.\u00a0 It hurt, but of course it hurt; Sherlock had probably gone and broken his wrist like the idiotic git he was.\u00a0 The fine bones ached and throbbed, the way they would if they were healing, until it faded into discomfort then went away entirely.\n\u201cShit,\u201d John muttered.\u00a0 There wasn\u2019t much point in swearing aloud when you were alone, but it made him feel better.\nWell, the hope that Sherlock would never notice anything just went sailing out the window.\u00a0 John had never been entirely certain whether Sherlock was aware of the bond or not, and he\u2019d often wondered if Sherlock would notice if it was broken \u2013 would he be aware something had changed, or did the bond operate on a level that Sherlock\u2019s brain just wasn\u2019t built to register?\u00a0 John had been afraid to test it when he still thought they were friends, because even if poking and prodding the bond didn\u2019t set something off, just the change in his behaviour might have made Sherlock suspicious.\nBut now John had healed him, and there was no way Sherlock could have missed that.\u00a0 For all that he\u2019d talked about Sherlock\u2019s \u2018spectacular ignorance\u2019, John was pretty sure Sherlock would know it wasn\u2019t normal for a broken wrist to fix itself within a few minutes.\nAll he could do was hope that Sherlock was too preoccupied with\u2026whatever he was doing\u2026to experiment.\n--\nJohn gripped the arm of the chair and resisted both the urge to scream and to grip the part of his body that hurt.\u00a0 He knew it wouldn\u2019t help.\nHe hated broken fingers.\nHe especially hated when he was suffering them because Sherlock seemed to be systematically injuring himself.\u00a0 Probably to test out his newfound healing ability, just like John had been hoping he wouldn\u2019t.\nJohn had been watching some crap telly to bore himself enough to go to sleep when the bond started twinging, broadcasting a strange cocktail of feelings, the most prominent being lemon-scented pain and a bubbling, glimmering curiosity.\u00a0 It told him that whatever was happening was mild (it was when John could taste the pain that he had to start worrying), and the curiosity had made John suspect that Sherlock was doing it to himself, so he\u2019d done his best to ignore it.\nHe couldn\u2019t fix every little thing, and maybe Sherlock would lose interest if nothing happened.\nBut then there was something that felt like Sherlock had cut open his own arm from wrist to elbow, and\u2026well, John had to fix that.\u00a0 Except Sherlock, the bloody idiot, had just done it again.\u00a0 And now he was apparently breaking fingers.\nJohn was half-tempted to leave him like that so he wouldn\u2019t do it again, but no sooner had the thought occurred to him that he felt guilty.\u00a0 For a moment, he was nothing but furious \u2013 how could Sherlock make him feel guilty?\u00a0 Sherlock was the one who\u2019d faked his death and gone off to do something dangerous without him and was now breaking his fingers out of twisted curiosity \u2013 John had nothing to feel guilty about!\nHe felt guilty anyway.\u00a0 Because he was the one who\u2019d healed Sherlock and piqued his curiosity in the first place, and because whatever Sherlock was doing was dangerous.\u00a0 Sherlock needed to be as close to full strength as possible, or he could end up severely injured or worse.\nAt least after John healed the broken finger, Sherlock seemed content to let it be.\u00a0 Well, he was probably taking samples of his skin and blood and analysing them or something, but he wasn\u2019t mutilating himself anymore.\u00a0 John had learned to take the victories he could.\nHe told himself he wouldn\u2019t be healing Sherlock again.\u00a0 It was a lie, but it was a comforting one.\n--\nIt was strange how the drudgery of routine could make time blur.\u00a0 Little \u2018incidents\u2019 with Sherlock broke the monotony somewhat, but for the most part John\u2019s life consisted of work, attempting to socialise, eating and sleeping.\u00a0 Two years had passed almost before he knew it.\nHe tried dating, but his heart wasn\u2019t really in it and John soon stopped.\u00a0 It might have been different if he\u2019d thought Sherlock was dead, but this strange limbo where he knew Sherlock had lied to him (had left him), but still felt what he was feeling\u2026there was no closure, no chance to move on. He was still healing Sherlock, for Christ\u2019s sake!\nThe fact that he could heal Sherlock said a lot about how well he was moving on \u2013 in that, he wasn\u2019t moving on at all.\u00a0 John could only heal people he loved, after all.\nMost of the time, John wanted to track Sherlock down just to scream at him (or maybe punch him, that\u2019d get him some closure, right?), but he had no idea where to find him.\u00a0 The bond wasn\u2019t GPS \u2013 it didn\u2019t come with a homing signal, only a vague sense of Sherlock\u2019s general direction.\u00a0 And John knew he couldn\u2019t find Sherlock if Sherlock didn\u2019t want to be found.\nSo he went through his routine as a now-established GP, wondering if this was what the rest of his life would be like.\u00a0 Hopefully he\u2019d find a way to break the bond, and then maybe he could start to recover.\u00a0 (And maybe he was thinking about \u2018recovering\u2019 from Sherlock like he was recovering from a disease, but John though the simile fit.)\nIn short, being kidnapped was almost a relief.\n--\nJohn would have stood a chance against an actual person.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t read people\u2019s minds to know when he was going to be attacked, but he could influence them as soon as they started in on him.\u00a0 Fear was always a good one, useful for making them falter or even run away.\nBut you couldn\u2019t push emotions on a poisoned tea bag, and John could admit he never suspected a thing.\u00a0 He\u2019d felt a little drowsy after the tea, but he hadn\u2019t thought anything of it \u2013 it had been a long, dull day of routine, and he\u2019d felt he deserved a nap.\nIt was only when he woke up and realised he wasn\u2019t in his flat that John knew something was wrong.\nJohn kept his eyes closed, just in case he was being watched.\u00a0 He was lying on his side on a surface that was hard and even but slightly rough \u2013 concrete, most likely \u2013 and he was feeling cold but not damp.\u00a0 Basement?\u00a0 Someplace industrial with little insulation?\u00a0 There was metal around his left ankle, thicker and heavier than a handcuff and lumpy.\u00a0 Maybe a chain?\nJohn cautiously reached out with his empathy, and to his surprise the bond with Sherlock responded.\u00a0 It was sharp and bright in a way it hadn\u2019t been in years, with worry and fear and pain glowing like warm coals and singing out that Sherlock was close.\u00a0 Very close.\n\u201cJohn?\u201d\nJohn opened his eyes.\nIt was a chain on his leg \u2013 big and thick, wrapped around his ankle and locked with a plain padlock.\u00a0 John was barefoot and without his jacket, just as he\u2019d been when he\u2019d laid down for his \u2018nap\u2019, and he wasn\u2019t missing any other clothes.\nHe\u2019d been right about the concrete floor, and one of the walls was brick.\u00a0 The other three were corrugated iron, and while that would usually make John hopeful about his chances of breaking down the door, he knew there wasn\u2019t enough slack in the chain for him to reach it.\u00a0 The chain was anchored to a large metal ring embedded in the floor, wrapped and locked with a padlock like his ankle.\nHe could see all this by the light of a single bare bulb dangling from the ceiling \u2013 there weren\u2019t any windows.\n\u201cJohn?\u201d\nWith a deep breath to try to calm himself, John looked over at Sherlock.\nHis appearance was a bit of a shock.\u00a0 He was wearing a ratty T-shirt with the radioactive symbol on it, khaki-coloured trousers and his hair looked greasy and unwashed.\u00a0 For a man who usually looked so elegant, it was certainly a step down.\u00a0 He was secured more thoroughly than John was \u2013 he was handcuffed in addition to the ankle chain.\u00a0 He also had a split lip and a black eye.\n\u201cHello, Sherlock,\u201d John said evenly, clamping down on his emotions so he wouldn\u2019t risk accidentally sending something through the bond.\nSherlock was looking shaken.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re not surprised?\u201d\nJohn felt an impulse to burst into hysterical laughter.\u00a0 \u201cI knew you were alive.\u201d\n\u201cSince when?\u201d Sherlock sounded almost offended.\n\u201cSince about\u2026a minute or two after you did it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u00a0 I had everything planned-\u201d\n\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t be reminding me of this right now,\u201d John interrupted, pushing himself into a sitting position and feeling a surge of fury at the reminder that Sherlock had planned that charade, had planned to betray John and leave him alone.\n\u201cBut you\u2026you seemed\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a very good actor,\u201d John snapped.\nSherlock shifted, like he wanted to move closer, but John realised Sherlock was at the limits of his ankle chain \u2013 he couldn\u2019t move any closer to John unless he laid himself flat on the floor.\u00a0 But there was only about two feet between them, and they could touch if John pulled his own chain taut.\u00a0 Which meant this was a deliberate move; their captor wanted them to be able to touch.\nJohn didn\u2019t pretend to be an expert on interrogation, but he knew you only indulged a bond between captives when you were planning on manipulating that bond.\nSherlock opened his mouth, but John cut him off.\u00a0 \u201cAny ideas?\u201d\nSherlock immediately looked shifty.\u00a0 \u201cJohn, you have to understand-\u201d\n\u201cAny ideas?\u201d John repeated, carefully keeping his voice flat and even and throttling the scream that was trying to burst from his throat.\n\u201cSebastian Moran,\u201d Sherlock said, sounding like he was trying to match John\u2019s tone.\u00a0 \u201cFormer sniper in the army, dishonourable discharge.\u00a0 He was Moriarty\u2019s second in command.\u201d\n\u201cWas his second in command? \u00a0He\u2019s gone rogue?\u201d\nSherlock hesitated.\u00a0 \u201cMoriarty\u2019s dead.\u201d\nThat was news to John.\u00a0 \u201cSince when?\u201d\n\u201cTwo years.\u201d\u00a0 Sherlock\u2019s voice was almost strained.\u00a0 \u201cMoran wants information about his death.\u00a0 Or to be more precise, he wants lies about his death, since he refuses to believe the truth.\u201d\nJohn would like to ask what that truth was, but that wasn\u2019t relevant at the moment and wouldn\u2019t aid in their escape.\u00a0 He was trying to be distantly professional about the whole thing, treat Sherlock like one of those colleagues he didn\u2019t like but had to work with.\nJohn wasn\u2019t optimistic about his chances of success, but he could at least try.\n\u201cSo when can we expect a visit?\u201d John asked.\nSherlock shrugged.\u00a0 \u201cImpossible to say.\u201d\n\u201cHas he visited before now?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nGetting information out of Sherlock that he didn\u2019t want to give had always been like pulling teeth, and John didn\u2019t have the patience to deal with it right now.\u00a0 \u201cSherlock, I\u2019ve been drugged and kidnapped and I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s coming next but it probably won\u2019t be nice, so how about you tell me what you know so I can at least brace myself.\u201d\nSherlock didn\u2019t flinch, but the bond did.\u00a0 Pinched-lemon fear and burnt-plastic guilt and frayed-red worry all burst into his brain like bullets from a machine gun.\n\u201cMoriarty killed himself-\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure of that, are you?\u201d\u00a0 John grimaced, angry at himself \u2013 he\u2019d been trying to get past this resentment, and interrupting Sherlock for petty digs wasn\u2019t going to help them.\n\u201cFairly certain, yes.\u201d\u00a0 Sherlock\u2019s voice was acerbic, but his feelings were\u2026complicated.\u00a0 The guilt throbbed sharply, like a freshly-opened wound, but it was thick with something that felt like oily righteousness.\u00a0 \u201cBut the body was\u2026removed.\u00a0 Moran held Moriarty in some level of affection, and refuses to believe that he committed suicide.\u00a0 He also wants to know the location of the body, and I assume he\u2019s planning to torture us for it.\u201d\nThat made sense.\u00a0 Or at least, made sense to the type of psychotic murderer that Moran probably was (being Moriarty\u2019s second and all that), except for one bit.\u00a0 \u201cWhy does he think I know anything?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the purpose of your presence is to extract information from you,\u201d Sherlock said quietly, looking at the ceiling.\nOkay, so Moran thought torturing John would get Sherlock to talk.\u00a0 At least that explained why he\u2019d been kidnapped and why the chains were long enough to let them touch \u2013 John had been right, Moran was planning to exploit the affection he thought Sherlock held for John.\nMaybe that was harsh; John knew Sherlock did hold some affection for him.\u00a0 Just not very much, it would seem.\n\u201cDo you know where we are?\u201d\n\u201cNot the actual location,\u201d Sherlock admitted, sounding furious at himself.\u00a0 \u201cThe style and degradation of the brickwork is consistent with an industrial building, most likely chemical-based.\u00a0 But the smell indicates it hasn\u2019t been in use in at least three years, possibly four.\u00a0 I was unconscious until approximately half an hour ago, but judging by the footsteps I\u2019ve heard, this place is quite expansive and Moran is employing at least five thugs.\u201d\nJohn nodded, already planning their escape.\u00a0 Not that it took much planning \u2013 he\u2019d wait until someone came in and got within range, hit them with enough fear to terrify them into paralysis, then disarm them and knock them out.\u00a0 Even if this hypothetical person didn\u2019t have the keys on them, they\u2019d probably have something Sherlock could use to pick the locks.\u00a0 Once they were out of the chains, they could go from there.\nSo maybe his plans had room for improvement, but John wasn\u2019t going to hang about getting tortured while he came up with a new one.\nAnd escape plans always went better when everyone was healthy.\u00a0 Sherlock\u2019s injuries looked (and felt) superficial, but pain still slowed your reflexes and made you vulnerable.\nJohn both wanted to heal Sherlock and hated the very idea.\u00a0 Hated it because Sherlock would know, and Baskerville and the fake suicide had proven exactly how much John should trust Sherlock with his well-being.\u00a0 And he wanted it because at least then it would be done, John\u2019s biggest secret would be revealed, and the worry and waiting would be over.\nStill, he had to check; \u201cAny surveillance in here?\u201d\n\u201cNo \u2013 this is a very sloppy operation.\u201dGood enough to catch you, John thought but didn\u2019t say.\n\u201cAre you hurt anywhere else?\u201d John asked, focusing his gaze on Sherlock\u2019s split lip.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Sherlock huffed, leaning back from him.\u00a0 \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry \u2013 there\u2019s been a new development, which I\u2019m sure will seem very unusual but which has proven reliable, so don\u2019t-\u201d\n\u201cStop moving,\u201d John muttered, shuffling close enough to grab Sherlock\u2019s hand.\u00a0 \u201cThis is easier with physical contact.\u201d\nJohn closed his eyes and reached for the pain.\u00a0 It hurt more than he was expecting \u2013 there were some bruised ribs along with the mangled face \u2013 but he set his teeth and breathed slow and even until the pain began to fade.\n\u201cIt was you,\u201d Sherlock breathed.\nJohn opened his eyes, unable to stop himself from giving a short, satisfied nod as he took in Sherlock\u2019s healed face.\u00a0 \u201cYes, it was me.\u201d\nUnder other circumstances, Sherlock\u2019s lost expression might have been funny.\u00a0 \u201cSo every time-\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when I-\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cHave you always been able to do this?\u201d\u00a0 And now Sherlock was irritated, but it was creaking and sparky \u2013 irritation at himself for failing to deduce this, rather than at John for not telling him.\n\u201cIf you mean the healing, then I\u2019ve been doing that since I was a kid,\u201d John admitted.\u00a0 And then, because he might as well go all the way, \u201cBut this is really just an offshoot of my empathy.\u201d\n\u201cYour what?\u201d\n\u201cMy empathy.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I call it.\u00a0 I can feel other people\u2019s emotions.\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s eyes narrowed, but John couldn\u2019t feel even a flicker of disbelief.\u00a0 \u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u00a0 I only know that I\u2019ve been doing it all my life.\u201d\u00a0 John laughed, short and harsh.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u00a0 You asked me once how I knew \u2013 how I always knew, with everyone.\u00a0 This is how.\u201d\n\u201cBut how does that work?\u00a0 Can you recognise them as distinct from your own feelings?\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t come as only feelings,\u201d John admitted.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like synaesthesia.\u00a0 I feel other people\u2019s emotions, but I also see them, hear them, taste them, smell them\u2026it\u2019s hard to describe.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the ability to heal people is somehow related to this?\u201d\n\u201cI can feel people\u2019s pain.\u00a0 And I just try to\u2026pull it into myself.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t work for everyone.\u201d\u00a0 Which was definitely an understatement, but all John felt comfortable saying.\n\u201cYou were\u2026\u201d Sherlock swallowed, the bond prickling with rose-tinted worry.\u00a0 \u201cIt looked like it hurt.\u201d\nJohn shrugged.\u00a0 \u201cThe pain has to go somewhere.\u00a0 It goes to me.\u201d\nSherlock shifted, his emotions turning muddy and clotted and John didn\u2019t have the energy to pick them apart.\u00a0 Instead he leaned back against the wall, closed his eyes, and tried to use his empathy to feel out how many people were holding them.\nHe could feel a man quite close to the brick wall, exuding a kind of calm boredom that said he was either used to kidnapping and interrogation or had no idea what he was guarding.\u00a0 There was a woman near the door, splashed with soft ripples of excitement, like she was enjoying what she was doing or looking forward to something.\u00a0 Her signature was moving \u2013 patrolling, or did she have somewhere to go?\u00a0 John kept himself focused on her, noting that she moved further away, remained there for a few minutes, and then returned to her original position.\nNow, was that a trip to the bathroom, or had she gone outside the building for a quick smoke or something similar?\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nJohn was used to ignoring distractions while he did this, but Sherlock was hard to ignore.\u00a0 John opened his eyes and pinned Sherlock with what he hoped was a glare that expressed his full level of frustration.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to determine how many people we have to worry about,\u201d he said flatly.\u00a0 \u201cDo you think you can let me do that?\u201d\nSherlock frowned.\u00a0 \u201cAnd that\u2019s something your\u2026empathy\u2026can tell you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, everyone\u2019s emotional signature is different.\u201d\n\u201cEmotional signature?\u201d\n\u201cI feel emotions, but different people make me think of different things.\u00a0 I know it sounds strange, but that\u2019s really the best way I can describe it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve always been able to do this?\u00a0 With everyone?\u201d\nJohn snorted to himself.\u00a0 \u201cI must admit, I always wondered about the look on Donovan\u2019s face if she ever found that I was the freak, not you.\u201d\nSherlock was silent for a moment, and John was just about to shut his eyes and get back to work when he spoke again.\u00a0 \u201cSo you feel their emotions, and you understand them-\u201d\n\u201cNot always,\u201d John interrupted.\u00a0 He felt he should be clear on this point.\u00a0 \u201cEmotions are complex and confusing, and they\u2019re much more so when you don\u2019t know the thoughts and experiences attached to them.\u00a0 I can feel them, sure, but I have no idea about the reasons behind them.\u201d\nSherlock made the low, humming noise that indicated he was thinking, and John wondered at the prickle of watery fear and rough green relief that flowed down the bond.\u00a0 But he only wondered for a moment \u2013 he had things to do, and John shut his eyes again to concentrate on his empathy.\nThere was another man to the right of the cell, further away than the woman outside the door.\u00a0 There were two men and a second woman to the left, even further away than the third man.\u00a0 Not for the first time, John wished he had some reliable way of measuring distance with his empathy apart from \u2018close\u2019 and \u2018further away\u2019.\nThe congregation suggested some kind of entrance.\u00a0 Or a meeting.\u00a0 Or maybe just a lunch room \u2013 kidnappers had to eat too, right?\nJohn tried to push his senses further, but he couldn\u2019t pick up any more individual signatures before they started getting blurry and indistinct.\u00a0 So unless they were in a complex the size of a shopping centre (unlikely), he\u2019d assume there were six people holding them \u2013 four men and two women.\nJohn opened his eyes.\u00a0 \u201cOkay, there are six people we have to deal with.\u00a0 A woman near the door, a man behind the wall there, another man somewhere in that direction, and two men and a woman over there,\u201d he said, pointing in the appropriate directions.\n\u201cExcellent work, John,\u201d Sherlock said, sounding like he used to when he had a plan.\u00a0 More specifically, when he had a plan that involved John in some way.\nJohn tried not to make comparisons to pawns and cogs, but it was hard.\n\u201cAll we need to do is-\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d John said firmly.\n\u201cBut-\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, John-\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet,\u201d John hissed.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m trying to concentrate.\u201d\nHe\u2019d never managed to use his empathy to call someone over to him, but he figured he could give it a shot.\u00a0 He just needed to figure out what kind of emotion would make someone walk into a dungeon to torment captives\u2026\n\u201cOn what?\u201d Sherlock frowned, suddenly scornful.\u00a0 \u201cI have a plan-\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d John snapped.\u00a0 \u201cChrist, you didn\u2019t speak to me for two years easily enough, can\u2019t you go a few more minutes?\u201d\nSherlock fell silent, the bond going icy with guilt and irritation, but John was more focused on the new emotional signature he could feel approaching.\u00a0 Was it Moran?\nJohn thought it was.\u00a0 The man was pulsing with wine-dark satisfaction and fluttering excitement.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t like the woman\u2019s \u2013 that was vague and weak, but this was like black cocoa, thick and rich and liable to give you a headache if you ate too much.\u00a0 With anger and resentment undercutting it all, like points of barbed wire gleaming with blood.\u00a0 John never knew these things for certain, but it felt a lot like a man who had worked towards revenge and was finally getting it.\nHe knew it was Moran when the new emotional signature encountered the three congregated at\u2026wherever that was.\u00a0 All three picked up a slightly purple tinge of fear, like the slight sourness of an apple \u2013 light but there.\u00a0 Like the boss had just come to look over their shoulder, and the boss was a crazy assassin.\nOne of the men detached himself from the group and approached their cell.\u00a0 The woman in front of the door flared with renewed excitement, and together they moved closer.\n\u201cMoran\u2019s here,\u201d John whispered, lying down on the ground and closing his eyes \u2013 if he could trick them into thinking he was still unconscious, they were likely to come closer.\u00a0 \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming in.\u201d\nThe door screeched open just as he finished talking \u2013 the hinges were in very bad shape \u2013 and the man and woman entered.\u00a0 John could feel Sherlock\u2019s irritation and worry, but he concentrated on the two people who had entered.\nThere was a metallic click and a rustle, like someone drawing a weapon from a holster.\u00a0 Gun or knife?\u00a0 John supposed it didn\u2019t matter.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to try anything,\u201d the woman says, and John was aware of the man approaching him.\nThe kick was a surprise, though \u2013 right in the small of his back, too.\u00a0 John groaned and curled into himself, trying to act as though he was just rousing from a drugged stupor.\n\u201cLeave him alone,\u201d Sherlock snapped.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d the woman barked.\nThe man yanked on the chain attached to John\u2019s ankle, twisting the padlock up and opening it.\u00a0 Just what John had been hoping for.\nIt had been a while since he\u2019d done this so deliberately, and with such intent to harm.\u00a0 Moriarty had been his latest attempt, and John did what he\u2019d done then \u2013 shoving fear and despair and just about every negative emotion he could dredge up straight at them.\nHe opened his eyes to the sight of a blond man and brunette woman gasping and clutching at their chests like they\u2019d just been stabbed.\u00a0 The woman lunged toward him \u2013 she had a knife, not a gun, more\u2019s the pity \u2013 but John just rolled out of the way and she collapsed without him touching her.\nThey didn\u2019t move.\u00a0 John got to his feet and checked them, pressing his fingers to their neck and feeling no answering pulse.\u00a0 He tried not to think about pressing his fingers to Sherlock\u2019s wrist and feeling the same.\n\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d Sherlock said, staring at the bodies.\u00a0 \u201cHeart attack, yes?\u201d\nJohn nodded.\u00a0 \u201cMy push was maybe a bit stronger than I meant it to be.\u201d\nHe\u2019d pushed so much at Moriarty without any kind of impact, he\u2019d forgotten to adjust for other people.\u00a0 Not that John would be shedding any tears for these two, but it was slightly sickening to realise how easy it was to miscalculate that sort of thing.\nJohn felt the beginnings of a headache knotting his temples.\u00a0 A side-effect of whatever drugs he\u2019d been fed, or of pushing his emotions so hard?\nHe took the woman\u2019s knife and the man\u2019s keys from their hands, and began searching the bodies.\n\u201cWe need to move quickly,\u201d Sherlock was saying, already reaching out like he expected John to just hand him the keys.\n\u201cI need to move quickly,\u201d John corrected.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re staying here.\u201d\nHe could feel Sherlock\u2019s surprise, like the sudden taste of detergent \u2013 bitter and nasty.\n\u201cI can deal with them easily,\u201d John continued, gesturing to the two dead bodies laid out on the concrete.\u00a0 \u201cAnd my old CO used to say that the only thing worse than no one at your back was someone at your back that you didn\u2019t trust.\u00a0 You\u2019ll just distract me.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me.\u201d\u00a0 It would have been a flat statement of fact, if John couldn\u2019t feel the sudden hurt spilling through the bond, sharp as aged cheese.\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust you,\u201d John affirmed.\u00a0 Then, because he felt he should explain himself, \u201cI don\u2019t trust that any instructions you give me will be genuine instead of attempts to manipulate me.\u00a0 If you say \u2018duck\u2019, I won\u2019t duck \u2013 I\u2019ll look to see if you\u2019re telling the truth about the threat.\u00a0 We\u2019re less likely to get killed this way.\u201d\nJohn took a solid grip on the knife and made his way towards the door.\n\u201cJohn, you can\u2019t do this,\u201d Sherlock cried.\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t know what he\u2019s like, the things he\u2019s done...John! John you can\u2019t-\u201d\nJohn shut the door on Sherlock\u2019s devastated face, and did his best to shut down the bond.\n--\nJohn always tried to avoid opening up his empathy too far.\u00a0 It was like squinting your eyes when you were checking the position of the sun \u2013 if you opened them, the light dazzled you and you didn\u2019t see anything, so you had to control the amount of input.\u00a0 Except if you looked directly at the sun you could get eye damage and his empathy didn\u2019t so much as dazzle him as stop him being aware of what was happening to his body, and here was where the metaphor broke down.\nHe\u2019d slipped up a few times as a kid, just by accident.\u00a0 He\u2019d been focusing on one person because they had an interesting emotion, then someone else\u2019s emotions would grab his attention, and he\u2019d inadvertently open himself up to more and more stimuli until he was just a mind drifting on a sea of emotion, mostly unaware of his body or anything that happened to it.\u00a0 While John didn\u2019t walk into walls when he was like that, he\u2019d once nearly walked into traffic and he often \u2018woke up\u2019 with bruises and scrapes where he\u2019d collided or tripped and just went onwards without ever realising it.\nIt was like being so far in your head you didn\u2019t notice what other people were doing, except John got so far into other people\u2019s heads he didn\u2019t know what he was doing.\nHe knew it was dangerous, to open himself up to everyone in the warehouse, but it was also the most effective way of making sure they were all dealt with, quickly and (relatively) cleanly.\u00a0 John needed to take out five people who were likely armed and definitely dangerous, and the only physical weapon he had was a knife.\u00a0 His empathy was the only thing that was going to get him and Sherlock out of this in one piece, so John was going to use it.\u00a0 He was going to make sure he knew where those people were and what they were feeling because he couldn\u2019t feel anything but them.\nJohn couldn\u2019t really explain how it felt to drown in his empathy like that.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t like the Baskerville drug \u2013 they didn\u2019t overwhelm him to the point of being absolutely lost, but his attention was definitely\u2026absent.\u00a0 He was aware of people approaching him and trying to push fear on them.\u00a0 He was aware of them falling, of stabbing them to ensure they stayed down, and he was aware of them dying.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t aware of much else.\nOf course, John could only drift like that when there were a lot of empathic signatures around him.\u00a0 The less people there were, the easier it was for his brain to parse the emotions, to remain focused.\nWhen John came back to himself, he, Moran and Sherlock were the only people still alive in the building.\nHe\u2019d also managed to acquire a gun (John had a vague image of a woman drawing it and shooting at him as he charged her), but there were only three bullets left.\u00a0 John would have done a more comprehensive check of himself, but he could feel Moran approaching the cell Sherlock was still locked up in and he didn\u2019t have the time to waste.\nHe was a little disappointed in how out of shape he was, though.\u00a0 He was tired and it was taking real effort to breathe \u2013 the result of the painful stitch in his side, most likely.\u00a0 Or the way he kept coughing.\u00a0 Sherlock had said this place was old, and John hoped he hadn\u2019t inhaled any asbestos.\u00a0 And he must have stepped in a puddle because his right foot was moist with lukewarm fluid and was making nasty squishing noises as he ran.\u00a0 With any luck, it wasn\u2019t some awful chemical left over from when this place was still in use.\nHe turned a corner just as Sherlock rocketed out of the cell.\u00a0 John was surprised for as long as it took him to remember that the bodies had been left within Sherlock\u2019s range \u2013 he probably swiped something to pick the lock.\u00a0 Sherlock took one glance around, saw John, and suddenly paled.\nJohn would have turned around to check if someone was behind him, if his empathy wasn\u2019t telling him that the only threat in the place was about to come down the corridor.\nMoran turned the corner and raised his eyebrows at the sight of them.\u00a0 \u201cIf you want to threaten me with a gun, you should make sure you\u2019re not bleeding to death first.\u201d\nAnd even though Moran was pointing his own gun at him, John was too tired to stifle the reflex to glance down.\nThat was the problem with empathy.\u00a0 Living in other people\u2019s feelings and other people\u2019s pain often made it difficult to recognise your own.\nIf John hadn\u2019t been using his empathy, he would have realised he\u2019d been shot in the chest.\u00a0 And a graze \u2013 or perhaps a knife wound \u2013 had opened up his right thigh.\u00a0 The bullet had probably got him in the bottom of a lung, judging by the way blood was foaming around the wound, and he\u2019d obviously been bleeding for a while \u2013his jumper and jeans were soaked.\u00a0 John would bet he\u2019d been leaving a trail of bloody footprints behind him.\nHe was distantly surprised that he\u2019d been able to walk.\u00a0 Or perhaps it wasn\u2019t so surprising \u2013 he was feeling very tired (a side-effect of blood loss) and he\u2019d been having trouble breathing.\u00a0 Injuries could hinder, but it was pain that incapacitated and John hadn\u2019t really been in a position to feel much of anything.\nUntil now.\u00a0 He was feeling a lot of pain now.\n\u201cJohn\u2026\u201d Sherlock\u2019s voice wobbled, and the high whine of fear coming through the bond sounded like the screech of static.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Sherlock,\u201d John muttered, coughing a little and finally noticing that the back of his mouth tasted like blood.\u00a0 \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt as much as the first time I got shot.\u201d\nOf course, John knew that was a bad sign.\u00a0 If it didn\u2019t hurt as much as it should have, it was because most of the blood and oxygen going to that area was then pouring out of him rather than giving energy to the various nerves that could send pain signals.\u00a0 He leaned to the side, letting the wall take most of his weight, and he let the gun drop.\u00a0 Not just drop from a firing position but actually drop to the ground.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t going to do him much good, anyway \u2013 in this state he was more likely to hit Sherlock than Moran.\n\u201cYou\u2019re dying,\u201d Moran sneered.\u00a0 Because apparently he was the type that always had to gloat.\u00a0 \u201cHow much time do you think you have?\u00a0 Two minutes?\u00a0 Three?\u201d\nActually John knew it was more like ten.\u00a0 Maybe he only had a few minutes until he lost consciousness, but it would take him longer than that to actually die.\u00a0 People were always making mistakes like that.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said, trying to keep his voice from wavering.\nMoran was looking amused.\u00a0 \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, huh?\u00a0 Why not?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re going to die.\u201d\u00a0 Usually it was a bad idea to warn people about your tactics, but his empathy wasn\u2019t something that could be defended against.\u00a0 And he needed to buy time to gather his strength for another empathic hit.\n\u201cHe can fix it!\u201d Sherlock hissed, grabbing John shoulders in an effort to keep him upright.\u00a0 \u201cJohn, do you what you did to me \u2013 hurry!\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that, Sherlock.\u00a0 I take the pain, I don\u2019t give it away.\u201d\nJohn could taste blood on the back of his tongue, rising with each exhale.\u00a0 Which could mean a lot of things, really, but it was never a promising sign.\u00a0 A burst of hysteria hit and he giggled, feeling little bubbles of blood form at the corner of his mouth.\nMoran\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u00a0 \u201cI got a look at Wallace\u2019s body, you know?\u201d\nJohn had no idea who that was.\u00a0 Sherlock was trying to slowly pick up the gun without telegraphing his movements, so John kept his eyes fixed on Moran so he wouldn\u2019t inadvertently draw attention to him.\n\u201cHis throat was slit, but that wasn\u2019t what killed him,\u201d Moran continued.\u00a0 \u201cNot enough blood for that.\u00a0 But there wasn\u2019t any other mark on him, like he\u2019d just had a heart attack on the spot.\u00a0 Now I know you didn\u2019t manage to smuggle in poison\u2026so what are you?\u201d\nHe clearly meant it in the form of what John\u2019s rank and training had been in the army, but John answered honestly.\n\u201cA monster.\u201d\nThen he funnelled all his fear straight into the stormy hurricane that was Moran\u2019s emotional signature, hoping he could bring the other man down before he passed out just as Sherlock snatched up the gun, brought it to bear and pulled the trigger.\nJohn wasn\u2019t sure if it was his empathy or the bullet in his head that got Moran first, but his money was on the bullet.\u00a0 John didn\u2019t think he\u2018d pushed enough fear to startle a baby.\nHis knees were buckling, and Sherlock abandoned the gun to try to ease him to the floor.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t do a good job of it \u2013 John\u2019s elbows knocked the concrete painfully \u2013 but John appreciated the effort.\n\u201cJohn, what you did, does it work the other way?\u201d Sherlock was saying, his voice low and frantic, his emotions practically bludgeoning they were so loud.\n\u201cDunno\u2026\u201d John slurred.\nEverything was getting dim and distant, probably because of the blood loss.\u00a0 The wounds didn\u2019t even twinge anymore, and John knew he was going to die.\u00a0 Even assuming Sherlock could somehow acquire a phone, no ambulance could ever arrive in time.\nHe had the vague thought that he should be angry, or sad, or frightened, or something.\u00a0 But he just felt strangely resigned, as though there was some twisted peace in acknowledging that you were done for.\nThere was no \u2018please, god, let me live\u2019 this time.\nThough he was very annoyed at the way Sherlock was shaking him, at the fear and guilt and crushing despair spurting across the bond like\u2026well, like blood from a severed artery.\nIf he wanted to die in peace, John thought he\u2019d earned the right.\n\u201cJohn, look at me!\u00a0 Tell me how it works \u2013 I can help you if you\u2019ll just tell me how it works!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d John managed, before he coughed hard enough to feel drops of blood hit the back of his teeth.\nBecause you had to love someone to take on their pain.\u00a0 More than just love, in fact \u2013 you also had to admit it yourself, which was much more difficult.\u00a0 Sherlock scorned love because he feared it, and feared what it could drive people to.\u00a0 Sherlock might love John on some level, but he was unlikely to admit it, even to himself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fine!\u201d Sherlock snarled.\u00a0 \u201cThis is the very opposite of fine.\u00a0 This wasn\u2019t\u2026it isn\u2019t supposed to end like this!\u00a0 You\u2019re not allowed to die!\u201d\nHonestly, John thought his death was the only thing that made sense out of all this.\u00a0 That was how these stories went, after all.\n\u201cI told you,\u201d he gurgled \u2013 it really was getting difficult to breathe now.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not the hero, I\u2019m the monster.\u00a0 And monsters don\u2019t get a happy ending.\u201d\nThey died.\u00a0 That was how all the fairy-tales ended, and god knew John\u2019s life with Sherlock had been crazy enough to sound like a fairy-tale.\nSherlock was talking again, but John couldn\u2019t make sense of the words.\u00a0 He heard them, but they were lost in the haze that seemed to be rolling across his vision.\u00a0 He closed his eyes, and opening them again seemed like too much work, so he didn\u2019t try.\nHe could still feel someone shaking him, and then someone kissing him.\u00a0 John wondered who thought it was a good idea to kiss a dying man \u2013 his lips were coated with his own blood, after all, and even leaving aside the unpleasant taste, what if he had some kind of blood-borne disease?\u00a0 They were risking infection.\nThere was a vague sensation of hands tightening over his shoulders and breath breaking over his face in a gasp or sob.\nThen there was nothing.\nheal (verb)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to make healthy, whole; restore to health\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to bring conflict or strife between people or groups to an end or conclusion\n--\nJohn woke up, feeling rather surprised that he could.\nThe last thing he remembered was choking on his own blood on a concrete floor.\u00a0 He was still lying on the concrete floor, and he could still taste blood in his mouth, but he wasn\u2019t labouring to breathe anymore.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t in pain, and while his clothes were stained with blood it was stagnant and cooling instead of pumping and hot.\nSherlock was tucked against the wall, shaking and pale and watching John.\u00a0 His emotions were shrill and discordant \u2013 fear like knotted wire that tremored with hope and scraped along John\u2019s nerves.\n\u201cDid it work?\u201d Sherlock asked, his voice small.\nJohn parted the tear in his jeans, and lifted his shirt and jumper to survey his wounds.\u00a0 Except they weren\u2019t wounds, they were scars \u2013 pale pink, as if he\u2019d been injured years ago rather than minutes.\n\u201cI\u2019m alright,\u201d he pronounced.\u00a0 \u201cSome scars, but nothing hurts.\u201d\n\u201cIt hurt more than I expected,\u201d Sherlock said quietly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the pain of the injury, it\u2019s how much it would have hurt as it healed as well.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026how does that work?\u201d Sherlock sounded personally offended at the sheer illogic of it all.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cEmotions are, in essence, chemical and electrical signals within the brain \u2013 how can you pick up on that?\u201d\n\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Now, do we need to do anything here, or can you just call Mycroft to come clean this up?\u201d\nSherlock went still.\u00a0 \u201cYou know about Mycroft?\u201d\n\u201cEmpathy, Sherlock, remember?\u00a0 I know about Molly as well.\u201d\nConfusion crept through the bond like orange-hued mist, damp and obscuring.\u00a0 John wasn\u2019t sure if it was because Sherlock was still confused about his empathy or if Sherlock just didn\u2019t know how to proceed from here, so he did his best to ignore it.\u00a0 \u201cCome on, Sherlock, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d Sherlock muttered, and his emotions were suddenly flavoured with creamy relief and a vague, yellow-lavender sense of wonder and ashy disbelief.\u00a0 Then he blinked, like he was coming back to himself, and went on in a much firmer voice, \u201cMoran\u2019s dead.\u00a0 Mycroft can deal with this.\u201d\nJohn nodded.\u00a0 It seemed pointless to stand up just to wait around, so he scooted over to the wall opposite Sherlock and leaned his back against it.\u00a0 Sherlock was beginning to bristle with worry like shards of silver tilting into the light, and his eyes were fixed on the blood that still stained John\u2019s clothes.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t hurt,\u201d John said, his voice flat and tired.\nSherlock must have read something in his tone, because the worry only sharpened into knives.\u00a0 \u201cDoes anything hurt?\u201d\n\u201cHead,\u201d John admitted \u2013 his headache was creeping back.\n\u201cBecause of what you did?\u201d\u00a0 The wonder was starting to creep back into Sherlock\u2019s emotions.\nJohn shrugged.\u00a0 He honestly had no idea.\nBut he did have a question.\u00a0 \u201cWas Mycroft in on it from the beginning?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nJohn knew Sherlock wasn\u2019t confused or surprised \u2013 he was just asking for clarification; which beginning did John mean?\n\u201cYou planned this for a long time.\u00a0 Months.\u00a0 Was he in on it from the start?\u201d\n\u201cYou knew-?\u201d\nJohn sighed.\u00a0 \u201cNot at the time \u2013 I told you, it\u2019s not telepathy.\u00a0 But I was picking up on some weird emotions.\u00a0 Didn\u2019t make sense at the time, but in hindsight\u2026\u201d\nSherlock nodded, like he was mentally noting that down somewhere in his mind palace, and responded to John\u2019s question.\u00a0 \u201cHe knew.\u00a0 We planned it together.\u201d\nJohn laughed bitterly.\u00a0 \u201cOf course you did.\u201d\nHe supposed it had been foolish of him, to think that Mycroft would be stupid enough to spill information on Sherlock to a criminal and then let the criminal go.\u00a0 But that was nothing new \u2013 John had been aware for some time that he\u2019d been played for a fool.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to look at Sherlock, so he closed his eyes and tilted his head back to rest against the wall.\nHis headache was getting worse.\n--\nJohn got through Mycroft\u2019s arrival with his cronies and his subsequent lecture to Sherlock by the ingenious method of simply not acknowledging them.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t glance at Mycroft and he didn\u2019t speak even though several pointed silences invited him to, even when Mycroft suggested that Sherlock should go home with him and attempt to keep a low profile.\nSherlock was still in his usual habit of stubborn silence and unnecessary biting remarks when his brother was around, and he didn\u2019t address John at all.\u00a0 Though it didn\u2019t stop him from darting glances at John every five seconds while his emotions whispered worry and fear and sun-dappled resentment.\nAt this point, John\u2019s headache was getting to the point that he was really wishing for some painkillers.\u00a0 He wanted to close his eyes and rub his temples to see if it helped the discomfort, but he didn\u2019t want to reveal weakness in front of Mycroft.\nAt least Sherlock was quiet for the car trip away from the warehouse.\u00a0 In fact, he didn\u2019t say a word until they were back in John\u2019s house, just when John was closing the door behind them and thinking he might actually get a quiet rest for whatever remained of the night.\n\u201cIf they do DNA tests on the blood or pay any attention to the splatter, they\u2019ll know you lied,\u201d\nOne of the minions had made worried noises about the blood covering John\u2019s clothes, but he\u2019d just claimed it wasn\u2019t his.\u00a0 Sherlock hadn\u2019t said anything at the time, and John supposed he was an idiot for assuming he\u2019d just let it go.\n\u201cThey won\u2019t be able to test my clothes, because I\u2019m going to destroy them,\u201d John said bluntly.\u00a0 \u201cAnd if someone happens to have a paranoid streak and take a closer look at the blood I\u2019ve left on the concrete, Mycroft will just assume I was being a stoic military man and that my wounds were minor enough that I could treat them myself.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\u00a0 Sherlock looked like he thought he should have figured that out, and his embarrassment tasted like sour apples on John\u2019s tongue.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t my first rodeo.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had to come up with some good explanations over the years.\u201d\n\u201cPressure points!\u201d Sherlock exclaimed.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I was strangled, back when we were dealing with the Black Lotus.\u00a0 I was wondering why I felt so healthy after you touched me, and you said it was pressure points.\u201d\n\u201cLike I said, Sherlock, I\u2019m a good actor.\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s emotions being complex and confusing were nothing new, but this time whatever was going on in his head only seemed to be making John\u2019s headache worse, and his sigh was more pain than exhaustion.\u00a0 \u201cNow I\u2019m going to shower and get my clothes ready to\u2026I don\u2019t know, to be burned?\u201d\n--\nThe blood had long ago dried into a thin crust that crackled and flaked off John\u2019s clothes as he shed them, scattering across the tiles like spots of rust.\u00a0 It was slightly tacky on his skin, moistened by sweat, and itched where it stuck to the hair on his chest and legs.\nHe was rather surprised he\u2019d been allowed to go home \u2013 he was a walking biohazard.\nThere had been a large swathe of blood on the back of his jumper, and when he twisted in front of the mirror he could glimpse a pink, circular scar on his back.\u00a0 That was good news, because it meant the bullet had gone straight through him, and he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it drifting around his body and possibly causing problems later.\nJohn turned on the shower and waited for it to warm up, then simply stepped in under the spray.\u00a0 The water began to dissolve the dried blood, streaking his skin pink for a few moments before he scrubbed with the cloth to wipe it away and get the last stubborn drops out.\nHe was tired, and his empathy seemed \u2018louder\u2019 than usual, the emotions of his neighbours grating on his nerves rather than being something that could slip past him without making much impression.\u00a0 His headache actually seemed to have diminished though, and John hoped it stayed that away.\u00a0 He\u2019d prefer that it go away entirely, but he was trying to set realistic expectations.\nHe was disappointed anyway when he stepped out of the bathroom (dressed in a new shirt and loose pants) to find Sherlock lurking in the kitchen.\u00a0 As soon as he saw Sherlock, the headache hit him again like an axe between the eyes.\nSherlock seemed to take his groan as a sign of extreme exhaustion, and offered him a mug.\u00a0 \u201cCoffee?\u201d\n\u201cWhat have you done to it?\u201d John was too tired to mask his suspicion.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI prefer tea.\u00a0 I know that, you know that.\u00a0 The one and only time you made me coffee was to drug me.\u201d\nHurt wavered from Sherlock, like heat shimmers off an asphalt road.\u00a0 \u201cYour tea has been tampered with.\u201d\nOh, right.\u00a0 John felt a little bad for his assumption, but admittedly not enough to give Sherlock an inch.\u00a0 \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be the first person to decide this\u2026anomaly\u2026meant I was now their experimental subject.\u00a0 Hell, it wouldn\u2019t even be the first time you used me as an experimental subject.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been using yourself as an experimental subject!\u201d Sherlock snapped, brandishing a piece of paper John recognised as being the record of his attempts to break the bond.\u00a0 \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\u201cI was trying to break the bond,\u201d John said bluntly.\u00a0 He took a sip of the coffee, because he clearly wasn\u2019t getting any sleep tonight.\nHe was a little surprised to realise Sherlock had made it just the way he liked it.\u00a0 John hadn\u2019t known he paid attention to that.\n\u201cThe bond?\u201d Sherlock echoed.\u00a0 \u201cWhat-?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how it works,\u201d John said, yet again.\u00a0 \u201cBut I can form bonds with people.\u00a0 It means I can always feel what they\u2019re feeling, I have a vague sense of where they are, and I can heal them from a distance.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a bond with me.\u201d\u00a0 Sherlock\u2019s tone made it a statement, not a question.\nJohn nodded.\u00a0 \u201cAnd with Harry.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s how you knew I wasn\u2019t dead.\u201d\n\u201cI can feel it when people die.\u00a0 It\u2019s like all their emotions just\u2026go out.\u00a0 Like a light turning off.\u00a0 Yours didn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 He thought of Thomas.\u00a0 \u201cThough I did feel it once when someone didn\u2019t actually die.\u201d\nSherlock frowned, the way he did when an experiment did something he wasn\u2019t expecting.\u00a0 \u201cWho?\u201d\nJohn supposed he might as well air all his dirty laundry.\u00a0 \u201cThere was a man in my unit.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t my boyfriend, but we might have\u2026I suppose it doesn\u2019t matter now.\u00a0 He lost his leg, and I was trying to heal it when I was shot, and I made a mistake.\u201d\nSherlock didn\u2019t ask about the mistake, but there was a definite sense of eucalyptus-confusion coming from him.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2026you always say you\u2019re not gay.\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m not.\u00a0 I can\u2019t have sex with someone if they don\u2019t\u2026feel nice, for lack of a better word.\u201d\n\u201cYour empathy informs your perception that much?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something I activate, Sherlock, it\u2019s like sight or hearing.\u00a0 In fact, it\u2019s probably worse, because you can at least close your eyes or plug your ears, but my empathy doesn\u2019t come with an off switch.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever been able to make it stop?\u201d Sherlock asked, his voice and emotions strangely soft.\nJohn could admit he hadn\u2019t expected this question.\u00a0 But if anyone could relate to having a brain that just wouldn\u2019t stop, he supposed it would be Sherlock.\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t.\u00a0 And believe me, I\u2019ve tried.\u00a0 I can\u2019t count how many times I wished I could turn it off, but nothing does the trick.\u201d\n\u201cDrugs?\u201d\n\u201cOf course you would ask that,\u201d John sighed.\u00a0 \u201cAnd no.\u00a0 The only drug that had any kind of effect was the Baskerville one.\u00a0 It amplified my empathy until I couldn\u2019t\u2026I couldn\u2019t tell what was me and what was everyone else.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you seized.\u201d\u00a0 It was a realisation, not a question.\n\u201cI\u2019m still surprised I came out of that sane,\u201d John said, still feeling strangely apathetic about the whole thing.\n\u201cBut you did try drugs!\u201d Sherlock exclaimed, gesturing with the piece of paper again like he\u2019d just remembered it.\n\u201cI told you, I was trying to break my bond with you.\u00a0 No luck, as it turns out.\u201d\nSherlock was silent for a moment, worry and fear weaving together like slippery silk and rough hemp rope.\u00a0 \u201cWhy do you have brain surgery as an option?\u201d\n\u201cIf I was somehow able to locate the part of my brain that dealt with empathy, damaging it might break the bond or kill my empathy entirely.\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s fear suddenly gained strength, flaring like a burst of sparks when you tossed something on a fire.\u00a0 \u201cThe risks-\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason it isn\u2019t crossed out,\u201d John interrupted.\u00a0 \u201cThat was definitely a last resort.\u00a0 The kind of last resort that you consider but never actually use.\u201d\nSherlock looked and felt relieved, so John took another mouthful of coffee, and wondered if their discussion was over.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to tell me,\u201d Sherlock said quietly.\n\u201cI considered it,\u201d John admitted.\u00a0 \u201cBut then you locked me in the lab in Baskerville and tried to drug me to confirm something you already suspected.\u00a0 I can\u2019t deny I was worried that if I told you something this unusual you\u2019d be vivisecting me before the day was out.\u00a0 That\u2019s happened once before and I\u2019m not keen to try it again.\u201d\nSherlock didn\u2019t flinch but his emotions did, swelling with hurt like a boil ready to burst.\nJohn set his coffee down on the table as his headache spiked.\u00a0 \u201cLook, I\u2019ve got a headache, so I\u2019m going to go to bed \u2013 do you need anything?\u201d\nSherlock didn\u2019t respond, and John took that as a negative.\u00a0 He turned away from Sherlock and walked the few feet that took him from the tiny kitchen into the cramped bedroom.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t bother getting undressed \u2013 what he was wearing was comfortable enough \u2013 and just crawled beneath the covers.\nAs he closed his eyes, he reached out by reflex to touch his bonds.\u00a0 Harry was probably sleeping \u2013 there was a vague sense of her presence, drifting eddies of jasmine-scented contentment, so she was either asleep or so drunk she was practically comatose.\u00a0 He preferred to think she was asleep.\nBut the bond with Sherlock was\u2026strange.\u00a0 John had been trying to ignore it, so it was only now that he realised it was only giving him a vague and muffled view of Sherlock\u2019s emotions.\u00a0 It was still there, but it was dim and fleeting, a flickering candle next to Harry\u2019s 100-watt bulb.\nThe bond was diminishing, and John suddenly wondered if his headache was the bond\u2026tearing, for lack of a better word.\u00a0 Seeing Sherlock had brought to life all the feelings of betrayal and hurt that he\u2019d been quietly stewing in \u2013 had the mental withdrawal he\u2019d been attempting in Sherlock\u2019s presence been the missing piece for destroying the bond?\nHe\u2019d sort it out after he\u2019d got some sleep.\n--\nWhen John woke up, Sherlock was still in the flat \u2013 he could feel it.\u00a0 He was trying very hard not to feel anything else from him, but he knew Sherlock was there.\nJohn went through his morning routine on automatic; dressing and combing his hair and brushing his teeth and doing his shoulder exercises.\u00a0 It was strange to see new scars on his chest and leg \u2013 while his brain accepted that he\u2019d been injured, some part of it was insisting that he should have stitches and bandages, that the injury couldn\u2019t possibly have healed that quickly.\nSherlock was perched in John\u2019s armchair, staring out the window into the street, wearing the same clothes but clearly having showered at some point.\u00a0 John was rather surprised \u2013 he\u2019d been expecting to find Sherlock on his laptop, looking at John\u2019s files and being his usual obnoxious, intrusive self.\nJohn had forgotten how quiet Sherlock could be.\nHe made some coffee to wake himself up.\u00a0 He\u2019d been making it for one person for so long that it didn\u2019t even occur to him to ask if Sherlock wanted any until he\u2019d taken the first sip.\u00a0 He pushed aside the impulse \u2013 if Sherlock wanted coffee, he could make it himself.\n\u201cSo how does this work?\u201d John asked, moving to stand beside Sherlock\u2019s chair.\u00a0 \u201cWhat kind of paperwork is involved in coming back from the dead?\u00a0 Without getting arrested for fraud, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sherlock scowled, and the bright burst of his anger felt painful.\u00a0 \u201cMycroft\u2019s dealing with that.\u201d\nJohn didn\u2019t think there was anything to say to that.\u00a0 He drank his coffee and tried to ignore the prickling of discomfort that told him his headache was coming back.\nSherlock was looking at him, and though the anger hadn\u2019t left, there was now a hint of bitter confusion and resentment, hissing like a kettle just starting to boil.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what happened?\u201d\nJohn was in no mood to hear Sherlock boast about this. \u00a0\u201cI know what happened.\u00a0 You pretended to kill yourself.\u00a0 In front of me.\u201d\nJohn was trying very hard to be logical and unemotional, but even he could hear the fury in his voice.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t help it \u2013 just remembering that moment when he realised Sherlock had lied to him, had actually wanted him to grieve like that made anger and betrayal and the hurting keen of \u2018how could you do that to me?\u2019 howl across his thoughts.\nJohn actually choked and clutched reflexively at his head, make sure it hadn\u2019t actually split open, no matter how much it felt like it.\n\u201cYour head can\u2019t still be hurting,\u201d Sherlock snapped, in the voice that sounded like anger and frustration but had never fooled John, not when he could feel the still-water worry that undercut it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the bond,\u201d John sighed, keeping his eyes closed as the pain began to ease.\n\u201cWith me?\u201d\nHe nodded shortly, and was confused by the sudden wash of fear and pain from Sherlock, like the thundering roar and noxious fumes of a passing truck.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026it\u2019s hurting you?\u201d\u00a0 Sherlock\u2019s voice sounded off somehow, and the hurt radiating from him didn\u2019t ebb.\n\u201cIt\u2019s breaking,\u201d John said honestly.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s painful.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u00a0 What are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, really.\u00a0 It\u2019s just\u2026all the feelings I had when you first did this\u2026all the betrayal and fury are coming back, and I think, being faced with you and not wanting anything to do with the bond is finally making it disintegrate.\u201d\nAfter being wary of talking about his empathy for so long, it was nice to finally be honest about it, honest about everything.\u00a0 Well, maybe not \u2018nice\u2019, exactly\u2026but it was a relief.\nSherlock\u2019s fury flashed bright and sudden, like a red firework going off too soon and scorching the ground.\u00a0 \u201cBetrayal?\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t a betrayal, anymore than you grabbing Moriarty and telling me to run was a betrayal.\u00a0 You were going to die if I didn\u2019t.\u00a0 You and Lestrade and Mrs Hudson, if you think I should have gambled with your own life.\u201d\nIt said something that John\u2019s first thought was to wonder if Sherlock was being honest, or if this was another lie \u2013 a manipulation to try and get back into John\u2019s good graces.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t think Sherlock was lying, but what did he know?\u00a0 His empathy wasn\u2019t much use when it came to this.\nAnd even if he was telling the truth, what difference did it really make?\u00a0 So Sherlock had much more noble motives for the ruse than John had assumed \u2013 it was never the motives he\u2019d been so angry about.\u00a0 It was the fact that he hadn\u2019t trusted John with it, and that hadn\u2019t changed.\n\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t tell me.\u201d\u00a0 John was dimly surprised at how calm his voice sounded.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t risk it,\u201d Sherlock snapped, frustration swirling and eddying within him like bubbling kerosene.\nJohn snorted quietly, but didn\u2019t say anything.\nSherlock was still scowling.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re angry, aren\u2019t you?\u00a0 I don\u2019t see why \u2013 you know why I had to do it-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m hurt,\u201d John said honestly.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s hard to trust someone and care for someone and know they didn\u2019t feel the same.\u201d\n\u201cI do!\u00a0 I\u2019d think what I just told you-\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d John interrupted, still keeping his voice calm and steady.\u00a0 \u201cNot to the same level.\u201d\nThere, that should shut Sherlock up.\u00a0 And it did, for all of about twenty seconds in which Sherlock stared at John like he was trying to deduce something from him.\u00a0 Sherlock\u2019s frustration thickened and clotted, turning into pitch-dense determination.\n\u201cI can prove it,\u201d Sherlock said, in the voice he used when he\u2019d just solved a case.\u00a0 \u201cHow did I heal you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou said the healing only rarely works, and you refused to elaborate.\u00a0 You would have told me why if it was simple biology \u2013 you were practically telling me everything at that point \u2013 so that means whatever the reason is, it\u2019s emotional and private.\u201d\n\u201cOr maybe I just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cAgain, you would have said so.\u00a0 So tell me, how does it work?\u201d\nSherlock looked completely confident, but John could feel the doubt creeping in, like shadows cast by a guttering candle.\u00a0 John was half-tempted to prevaricate and misdirect, to leave Sherlock uncertain, but what was the point?\n\u201cLove,\u201d he sighed.\u00a0 \u201cYou have to love them.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Sherlock blinked, like he\u2019d been expecting that answer but was still startled to get it.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cI just wanted you to not die,\u201d Sherlock said, his voice soft as remembered fear licked at him like a sudden gust of snow.\u00a0 \u201cI was willing to do anything, even if I died instead.\u201d\nJohn didn\u2019t know how to feel about that.\u00a0 So he didn\u2019t say anything, even though Sherlock was looking at him and his emotions were glittering with expectation.\nEventually, the expectation gave way to warm, frothing impatience, like Sherlock was sick of waiting for him.\u00a0 \u201cSo when you healed me\u2026\u201d\nJohn nodded.\n\u201cYou never said anything!\u201d Sherlock was indignant, and John almost laughed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re married to your work, remember?\u00a0 No point in saying anything.\u201d\nSherlock faltered, and John realised he\u2019d just missed the perfect opportunity to claim that his affection was platonic.\nWell, too late now.\u00a0 Sherlock would either deal with it, or he wouldn\u2019t.\u00a0 John could admit he suspected Sherlock would just ignore his pronouncement, the way he\u2019d ignored John\u2019s entreaties to warn him before he left body parts in the fridge.\nBut Sherlock was staring at him with a strange expression on his face.\u00a0 His emotions were bitter-red regret and something that trembled and fluttered and felt suspiciously like happiness and\u2026and\u2026\n\u201cYou love me,\u201d John realised.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an empath!\u201d Sherlock snapped, and John was surprised to see a blush creeping across his cheeks.\u00a0 \u201cThis can\u2019t be news to you!\u201d\nJohn hoped he wasn\u2019t flushing, but this was an embarrassing mistake to make, let alone admit to.\u00a0 \u201cI told you, I know the emotions, but not the reason.\u00a0 I thought you were in love with Irene!\u201d\n\u201cIrene?\u201d Sherlock echoed, the way he did when he was honestly puzzled by something and trying to understand it.\n\u201cWhen you thought she was dead, you were\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI smoked a cigarette!\u201d Sherlock felt gravel-crunch indignant, like he couldn\u2019t believe John had made such a foolish assumption.\n\u201cAnd you sulked and composed-\u201d\n\u201cIf it had been you,\u201d Sherlock hissed, anger streaming from him like a sudden jet of hot water in ice.\u00a0 \u201cIf Mycroft had called me into the morgue to identify your body, do you know what I\u2019d have done?\u00a0 I\u2019d have first determined if your death was anyone\u2019s fault, and then I\u2019d have dealt with them.\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s tone made it clear that \u2018dealing with them\u2019 would have been final and permanent.\n\u201cAnd then, I\u2019d find enough cocaine or morphine to ensure I forgot you were dead, and then\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Sherlock trailed off.\u00a0 \u201cAnd then\u2026I don\u2019t know what would have happened after that.\u201d\n\u201cBut you were quite happy to make me think you were dead,\u201d John snapped, the feeling of hurt and betrayal boiling forth anew.\nSherlock loved him\u2026but he\u2019d still made John watch him die.\u00a0 That hadn\u2019t changed.\nHis head ached.\nSherlock looked confused, as if he couldn\u2019t understand why John was still angry.\u00a0 \u201cBut you know that I-\u201d\n\u201cI discovered I could heal when I healed my dog,\u201d John said.\u00a0 \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a love between equals.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re-\u201d\n\u201cI love you,\u201d John interrupted, feeling nothing but weariness.\u00a0 \u201cI do, but I don\u2019t trust you.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t know if I can, not after something like this.\u201d\n\u201cI did it for you!\u201d Sherlock all-but snarled.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because I knew they\u2019d be watching for that!\u00a0 If you could just get over-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to,\u201d John admitted, feeling a bitter smile curl his lips.\u00a0 \u201cWhen you told me about the threat, my first impulse was to wonder if it was a lie, just another manipulation.\u00a0 And that\u2026wasn\u2019t a good thing to think.\u00a0 So maybe\u2026\u201d John hesitated, but charged onwards because this had to be said.\u00a0 \u201cMaybe what we need is closure, for both of us to move on.\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s surprise and instant, visceral rejection felt like being slapped in the face with hot oil.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t-\u201d he started, then stopped and switched tacks, perhaps sensing that John was in no mood to be told what he could and couldn\u2019t do.\u00a0 \u201cJohn, I can fix this.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d John felt nothing but a dull amusement.\u00a0 \u201cHow?\u201d\nSherlock didn\u2019t seem to have expected that.\u00a0 John could see and feel him scrambling for answers, for an instant-fix where there was no instant-fix.\u00a0 John didn\u2019t even know if it could be fixed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d John sighed, and rose to start getting ready for work.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t forgive me, he wins.\u201d\nJohn stopped, but he didn\u2019t turn around or even look over his shoulder.\u00a0 On some level, he understood what Sherlock was doing \u2013 appealing to John\u2019s determination and his streak of compassion, hoping that he wouldn\u2019t be able to stand the idea of letting Moriarty win anything and would just brush everything under the rug for the sake of returning to the status quo.\u00a0 He understood, but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t pissed off at Sherlock for using it.\n\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t win,\u201d John said without looking at Sherlock.\u00a0 \u201cBut you lose.\u00a0 You lose\u2026whatever you thought this would be.\u00a0 Whatever you thought would happen after you came back.\u00a0 So don\u2019t try to hold that over me.\u00a0 You don\u2019t have anything you can hold over me.\u201d\u00a0 Then it occurred to John that Sherlock did, in fact, have something.\u00a0 \u201cI suppose you can always threaten to tell Mycroft about my empathy and have me dragged to Baskerville or wherever I\u2019d be taken, but I think I\u2019ve proved that I\u2019m more than capable of defending myself.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d never do that!\u201d\u00a0 Sherlock actually felt sticky-rose offended, like John had insulted him.\nJohn snorted.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019d want to do the experiments yourself, right?\u201d\nSherlock swallowed, and John could feel sharp-plastic shock and hurt shiver through him.\u00a0 \u201cI wouldn\u2019t experiment on you.\u00a0 Not like\u2026not like that.\u201d\nSome part of John was still suspicious \u2013 Sherlock could be lying, after all \u2013 but it was a relief to hear him say that.\u00a0 Sherlock tended to prefer lying by omission, so he was unlikely to do something if he specifically denied it.\nJohn nodded \u2013 still not turning around \u2013 and was just lifting his foot to continue out of the room when Sherlock spoke again.\n\u201cI was wrong, alright?\u00a0 I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be so\u2026affected.\u00a0 I knew they\u2019d be watching you, and I didn\u2019t know you were so good at pretending not to know things you did.\u201d\nSherlock must have been very upset \u2013 John had never heard him explain something so incoherently before.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not sorry,\u201d Sherlock said, practically burning with self-righteousness and determination.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll never be sorry that I saved your life.\u201d\nThere really wasn\u2019t anything John could say that he hadn\u2019t said before, so he walked away.\nAt least his headache was feeling better.\n--\nJohn\u2019s day was boring but steady.\u00a0 There had been a virus going around and most people just wanted a certificate to say that they hadn\u2019t been disguising a hangover as an illness.\u00a0 Of course, a virus also meant he had to explain to about half a dozen patients that no, antibiotics wouldn\u2019t help them because bacteria and viruses weren\u2019t \u2018basically the same\u2019.\nSometimes John wished there was some way of making learning that as mandatory as basic literacy.\u00a0 Granted, it wasn\u2019t nearly as important, but it would certainly save doctors hundreds of hours of work a year.\nJohn had never been the type to watch television or read the newspaper while he was at work, so he only knew something was going on when Mary popped her head around his door and said some reporters wanted to see him.\nJohn liked Mary \u2013 she was nice, and didn\u2019t put up with stupidity, and once when John had forgotten both his lunch and his wallet she\u2019d shared her own sandwich with him.\u00a0 If John had really thought Sherlock was dead and thus been able to move on, they might have started something.\u00a0 Mary had certainly flirted, but John had never been able to bring himself to take her up on it.\u00a0 After Sherlock\u2019s lie, saying he had \u2018trust issues\u2019 didn\u2019t even begin to cover it.\nThough he couldn\u2019t deny that sometimes he felt a little wistful, wondering what would have happened if he\u2019d been just a little more stable, a little less\u2026emotionally damaged.\nIf nothing else, there would have been something funny about falling in love with two Mary\u2019s.\nBut now wasn\u2019t the time to brood \u2013 reporters were asking for him?\n\u201cReporters?\u201d John echoed.\u00a0 \u201cFor me?\u201d\n\u201cApparently,\u201d Mary shrugged.\u00a0 \u201cDid you win the lottery?\u201d\nJohn shook his head, but he exhaled hard as a thought occurred to him.\u00a0 He waved Mary off, feeling her humming confusion and tingling anxiety move away as she did, like the sound of music fading into the distance.\nMary\u2019s empathic signature made him think of an orchestra without a conductor.\u00a0 Lots of activity, all happening right in front of you but still catching you by surprise when the music swelled \u2013 little, crucial movements lost in the white noise.\nWhen she was gone (probably to do some investigating of her own), John opened up a webpage on his computer and typed his own name into the search bar.\nHe really hoped he was wrong about this.\nThe top result was still his old blog, but the second was some hastily-written online article, proclaiming that a famous detective was back from the dead.\nJohn took a moment to remind himself that he couldn\u2019t actually kill Sherlock, no matter how tempted he was.\n--\nJohn didn\u2019t go home.\u00a0 If the reporters had managed to find out where he worked, he was sure they knew where he lived as well.\u00a0 He snuck out the back and Mary gave him a lift to a hotel to save him taking the tube.\nHe hadn\u2019t told her the whole story, but he\u2019d sketched out enough details for her to shake her head in sympathy and mutter, \u201cHe\u2019s a bit of an arsehole, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\nMary always had a gift for understatement.\nJohn didn\u2019t have anything with him except his wallet and the clothes on his back, but the room had those little complimentary soaps and even a toothbrush, so he\u2019d worry about that later.\u00a0 For now, he washed his shirt, trousers and socks in the bathroom sink and hung them up to dry.\u00a0 It left him walking around in his underwear, but such were the advantages of being alone.\nNot that he was alone for long.\u00a0 The bond told him Sherlock was getting closer, so he had some warning before the knock at his door.\nHe might have used the time to get dressed, but his only clothes were soaking wet, so John answered the door in his underwear.\u00a0 Some people might feel at a disadvantage, talking to someone fully unclothed while they were almost naked, but John honestly didn\u2019t care.\nBesides, the way Sherlock blinked and stared left John feeling like he was the one with the upper hand.\nSherlock\u2019s stare had lingered on John\u2019s hips and shoulders, but it was concentrated on his scars.\u00a0 On the white starburst at his shoulder where the first bullet had hit him all those years ago, and the line where it was later removed.\u00a0 He thought he actually heard Sherlock suck in a sharp breath as is eyes landed on the new pink circle in the middle of John\u2019s chest, and the fresh line across his thigh.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking good for a man who was dying less than twenty-four hours ago, aren\u2019t I?\u201d John snorted.\nSherlock twitched as though startled out of contemplation, and John stood aside to let him enter.\u00a0 He\u2019s rather not have this conversation in the hallway of a hotel.\n\u201cIs there any point in asking how you found me?\u201d he wondered, slumping down on the couch.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t come home!\u201d Sherlock snapped, prickly and rough with anger, like fur or velvet rubbed the wrong way.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come home because some inconsiderate bastard set the journalists of London on me without any warning!\u201d John snapped.\nThe anger turned into wavering guilt, shimmering like a heat mirage with streaks of blue hope bleeding through.\u00a0 And just like that, John understood what Sherlock had been trying to do.\n\u201cYou wanted them to take me by surprise and corner me,\u201d he said flatly.\u00a0 \u201cYou were hoping for them to push me into making a statement about forgiving you, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\nHis headache was back.\nThe guilt felt stronger now, as if Sherlock knew that was an underhanded tactic to use but had done so all the same.\u00a0 \u201cI thought if you just saw-\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d John interrupted, feeling his weariness return.\nHe didn\u2019t want to talk, or fight, or\u2026whatever it was Sherlock expected them to do.\u00a0 There was nothing to say that hadn\u2019t already been said, nothing that would somehow make this easier.\u00a0 Right now, John didn\u2019t even want to look at Sherlock \u2013 he just wanted distance.\u00a0 Distance and quiet and something resembling peace.\n\u201cSherlock, just go,\u201d he sighed.\u00a0 \u201cPlease.\u00a0 If you ever cared for me beyond my usefulness with a gun or how I fed your ego\u2026leave me alone.\u201d\nJohn closed his eyes, but the hurt Sherlock felt flashed in orange fire behind them, smouldering and gritty like clay just drawn from a kiln.\u00a0 He could feel it cool into a rigid anger, dark and smooth like a stone worn from handling, and then it abruptly collapsed into\u2026.was that resignation?\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\u00a0 Sherlock\u2019s voice was small and timid.\nJohn tracked Sherlock\u2019s progress to the door by the sound of his footsteps, but didn\u2019t open his eyes until he heard the other man speak again.\nSherlock had paused in the doorway, one hand on the knob, but he didn\u2019t look back at John.\u00a0 \u201cI am sorry that I hurt you.\u201d\nJohn knew that, on some level.\u00a0 He just wasn\u2019t sure how much he cared.\u00a0 \u201cBut you\u2019re not sorry you did it, are you?\u201d\nRighteous anger snapped from Sherlock like the crack of a bullwhip \u2013 sharp and deafening.\u00a0 But it was soon lost in regret that tasted like burnt tuna, and the sad strains of something that felt like love.\n\u201cI can\u2019t be sorry you\u2019re alive,\u201d Sherlock said quietly.\nAnd then he was gone.\n--\nGetting through the next three weeks felt like the state John had sometimes fallen into in Afghanistan.\u00a0 When there\u2019d been an ambush or a convoy drove into IEDs or whatever else that left dozens injured and he\u2019d had to work for days at a time, he\u2019d found himself falling into a state where he processed what was happening but felt no real emotional impact from it.\u00a0 It was remote and distant, like he was guiding a character through a video game rather than living it.\nElla had called it disassociation and had been worried about it.\u00a0 John should probably be worried about it too, but he\u2019d never been able to explain to Ella that he thought his \u2018disassociation\u2019 came from being overwhelmed by his own emotions and coasting on other people\u2019s to muffle them.\nJohn let the media storm die down.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t talk to Lestrade or Mrs Hudson or Molly and he ignored the black car that pulled up in front of the clinic until Mycroft took the hint and stopped sending it.\u00a0 He usually wasn\u2019t one for ignoring problems until they went away (that tended to end badly when you were in a war zone), but right now he was willing to indulge himself.\nThe journalists might have still been hounding him if he hadn\u2019t got sick of them trailing him into the clinic and made a comment that suggested he wasn\u2019t talking to them because he was upset at how they\u2019d defamed Sherlock\u2019s character two years ago.\u00a0 No one wanted to print anything that was badmouthing them, so they left him alone and he didn\u2019t have to comment on any of the stories proclaiming Sherlock a hero.\nThe bond was still there, and John had the vague thought he should do something about that.\u00a0 But every time he told himself he should go see Sherlock and complete whatever severing process had been started, he always managed to talk himself out of it.\u00a0 For all that he was still angry, John didn\u2019t want to cut his connection with Sherlock.\u00a0 At least, not anymore.\nIt was quite a change.\u00a0 Nursing anger and hurt for so long and then thinking about moving past it\u2026John didn\u2019t know if he was relieved or angry at himself for being a pushover.\nHe didn\u2019t forgive Sherlock.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t know if he could forgive something like that.\u00a0 But he was starting to believe that Sherlock had really just made a mistake \u2013 a bad one, but with good intentions.\u00a0 He said he hadn\u2019t contacted John because he was worried that people were still watching him and any move on Sherlock\u2019s part would have ended with John dead, and John felt as if he was starting to accept that as the truth.\u00a0 He knew more than anyone how fear could paralyse you, how you could be so afraid of putting someone at risk that you did nothing, but he\u2019d always had someone (a commanding officer, a supervising surgeon) to snap him out of it.\u00a0 Sherlock hadn\u2019t had anyone to snap him out of it.\nJohn couldn\u2019t forgive him \u2013 not now, possibly not ever.\u00a0 But maybe he could let it be.\u00a0 Move past it.\nHe rang Sherlock that afternoon, before he could talk himself out of it.\nHe was expecting the phone to ring out and leave him to do this by text, but to his surprise Sherlock answered on the second ring.\n\u201cJohn?\u201d\n\u201cYou answered the phone,\u201d John blurted, caught off-guard.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t expecting Sherlock to answer it!\n\u201cOf course I did,\u201d Sherlock snapped.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nJohn could feel Sherlock\u2019s worry spreading through him like a bleach stain, and wondered why.\u00a0 But then, given how their last conversation had gone, Sherlock probably thought John had to be in serious trouble to call him.\nWell, nothing to do but forge ahead.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time for me to trust you again.\u201d\nAnger and impatience swept along the bond like a wave, salty and gritty and stinging and cool all at the same time.\u00a0 Sherlock drew breath \u2013 probably to snap something about how John had said that before and Sherlock was leaving him alone like he\u2019d asked \u2013 but then he seemed to realise what John had actually said.\u00a0 At least, the anger and impatience vanished to be replaced by cautious hope, like sunlight peeking through heavy clouds.\n\u201cBut you\u2019re going to try?\u201d Sherlock asked, in the interrogative tone he used when he was nervous about something and trying not to let it show.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to try,\u201d John said.\u00a0 \u201cBut I\u2019m not moving in with you again, not for a while.\u00a0 We should probably\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Christ, he felt like a therapist just saying this, \u201c\u2026start over?\u201d\n\u201cStart over?\u201d Sherlock echoed.\u00a0 \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m told it\u2019s a legitimate form of rebuilding trust.\u201d\nJohn had read a few psychology books in his time \u2013 mainly in an effort to puzzle out why people\u2019s emotions seemed to contradict what they were actually doing and saying half the time.\u00a0 Of course, the whole \u2018starting over\u2019 thing was usually used in romantic relationships when someone had cheated on the other person or otherwise crossed a huge line, but John didn\u2019t see any reason to mention that.\n\u201cYou know why I did it,\u201d Sherlock muttered, sounding and feeling sulky.\n\u201cTrust issues, Sherlock \u2013 remember?\u201d\n\u201cDo we have to?\u201d\nJohn was starting to feel annoyed \u2013 he was making an effort here, couldn\u2019t Sherlock make one as well?\u00a0 \u201cNo, Sherlock, we don\u2019t.\u00a0 We can say \u2018it was fun while it lasted, goodbye, have a nice life\u2019 and that\u2019ll be it.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sherlock snapped, a quick lash of fear pricking at John\u2019s senses, like he\u2019d just stepped on a sharp rock.\u00a0 \u201cWe can go to Angelo\u2019s.\u201d\nJohn was tempted to demand they go somewhere more neutral, but it would take a stronger man than he to resist the lure of free Italian.\u00a0 \u201cTomorrow at seven?\u201d\nSherlock made a noise of affirmation, and John waited for the dial tone \u2013 Sherlock never prolonged phone calls.\u00a0 But it didn\u2019t come, and it took him almost a whole minute to realise Sherlock was actually waiting for him to hang up.\n\u201cSee you then,\u201d he said lamely, and ended the call.\nSherlock had answered his phone, even though he usually only did that for the promise of a case.\u00a0 He\u2019d waited for John to end the call instead of assuming he had all the information he needed and just hanging up.\u00a0 And \u2013 perhaps most important of all \u2013 Sherlock had actually respected John\u2019s request to leave him alone.\nSherlock really did love him.\nAnd John had no idea what to do with that.\n--\nJohn was surprised to find Sherlock waiting for him at the restaurant, especially since John had turned up ten minutes early.\nSherlock stared at him, and the bond fluttered with surprise \u2013 like he hadn\u2019t really thought John would turn up, even though he\u2019d been the one to suggest this \u2013 and tremulous hope.\u00a0 \u201cJohn.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d John said.\u00a0 \u201cDidn\u2019t expect you to be early.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here since six-thirty.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s shock must have shown on his face, because Sherlock frowned and looked away, his emotions pulling into himself like a porcupine bristling defensively.\n\u201cI had to make sure there were no reporters,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything about you in the papers for a week,\u201d John pointed out.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ve moved on.\u201d\nSherlock scowled.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s what they want you to think.\u201d\nHe sounded sulky and petulant, but he was leaning against the side of the restaurant in a tense way that told John it was make sure no one could sneak up behind him.\u00a0 His eyes were scanning every person on the street and his emotions were buzzing with nervous tension, like an irritated insect.\nThose two years clearly hadn\u2019t been easy on him.\u00a0 John had known that, on some level \u2013 how many times had he healed Sherlock\u2019s injuries? \u2013 but he hadn\u2019t wanted to accept it.\u00a0 He\u2019d wanted to keep his resentment and crush every hint of sympathy that crept into his heart.\n\u201cShall we go inside?\u201d John offered.\nSherlock nodded, and preceded him into the restaurant.\nAngelo actually waited until he was level with them to greet Sherlock personally, and John wondered if he\u2019d had to deal with reporters too.\u00a0 Usually, the big man shouted out Sherlock\u2019s name as if he wanted to inform everyone in the street.\n\u201cThe table by the window, just as you asked,\u201d Angelo enthused, shuttling them towards their seats.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll get a candle.\u201d\nIt was the same table they\u2019d taken the first night, when they\u2019d used it for surveillance.\u00a0 It even looked like Angelo had brought them the same candle.\nJohn tried not to laugh, he really did, but he couldn\u2019t help it.\u00a0 Trust Sherlock to take the \u2018starting over\u2019 thing seriously.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d The tangy citrus of Sherlock\u2019s emotions was tilting dangerously close to \u2018offended\u2019.\n\u201cJust\u2026this is a much more literal new beginning than I was thinking of,\u201d John grinned.\u00a0 \u201cDo I have to awkwardly ask you if you have a girlfriend or boyfriend again?\u201d\nSherlock stared, and the sudden rush of nervous hope felt like the first breath after a resuscitation.\u00a0 But he didn\u2019t reply.\nJohn was just beginning to regret saying anything when Sherlock dropped his eyes to his hands and spoke.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a boyfriend.\u00a0 But, there\u2019s someone\u2026\u201d his eyes darted to John for a moment before they flew away, and the fear felt like a sodden cloth choking him.\u00a0 \u201cAnd I think maybe we could\u2026\u201d\nSherlock trailed off, swallowing sharply, and John blinked.\n\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d\u00a0 John was honestly surprised \u2013 he knew Sherlock loved him, but relationships were a lot of effort, and a lot of risk, and he\u2019d thought that Sherlock would just decide it wasn\u2019t worth it.\nAnd maybe some part of him had hoped for just that; unrequited love was painful, but there was a kind of safety in it.\u00a0 Actually putting yourself on the line, opening yourself up to someone else\u2026it was frightening.\n\u201cOnly if you want to,\u201d Sherlock said quietly.\nWell, if Sherlock was being brave, John could too.\u00a0 He took Sherlock\u2019s hand, just because he wanted to, and the bond opened like one of those high-speed films of flowers blooming.\n\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d John said, feeling a ridiculous smile stretch his face.\nHappiness and relief burst like a meteor shower \u2013 illuminating the night without being blinding, throwing glittering sprays of colour \u2013 and John didn\u2019t quite know where it came from.\u00a0 From him?\u00a0 From Sherlock?\u00a0 Both?\u00a0 Looking at Sherlock\u2019s smile \u2013 small and private and wondering, as if he couldn\u2019t quite believe this was happening \u2013 John thought it was probably both.\nHis head didn\u2019t hurt anymore.\u00a0 John squeezed Sherlock\u2019s hand and basked in the light of their healing bond.\nIt was a start.End."
