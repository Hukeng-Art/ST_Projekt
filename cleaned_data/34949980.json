    "text": "\nThey had muzzled a student.\n\n\nUA, the top hero school in the nation, known for being a pillar of morality, had muzzled a student. And not just any student: Bakugou, one of the star hero students and winner of the sports festival was currently chained to a pillar and muzzled, hard metal boxes attached to his hands to keep him from blowing anyone up.\u00a0\n\n\nBelow, in the crowd of onlookers, Shinsou watched in horror, though he kept his expression blank. His stomach had sunk like a lead balloon, his mouth going dry and his hands shaking. The barely there, pale white scars that marked just across the tops of his cheeks and across the bridge of his nose seemed to burn at the memory of all the times he had been muzzled, the straps cinched so tight that the metal split the fragile skin on his face.\n\n\n\u201cWow, can you believe that?\u201d one of his classmates whispered to another, the pair looking at Bakugou with disgusted expressions.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI know, it's insane.\u201d\n\n\nAnd for a moment, Shinsou felt a burst of hope. Maybe, just maybe, someone was going to speak up. They would say how wrong it was for Bakugou to be treated like this. That \n\nno one\n\n should be treated like this. And then, his classmate finished the sentence.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s acting like a wild animal. Can\u2019t blame the teachers for being cautious like that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe kid is hardly heroic. I\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t done this sooner.\u201d\n\n\nWithout a word, Shinsou turned and left, taking long and fast steps straight to the bathroom, where he promptly locked himself in a stall. His knees buckled and his head hung over the porcelain toilet as he heaved, throwing up everything that he had eaten that day.\u00a0\n\n\nUA had muzzled Bakugou. No one seemed to care.\n\n\nIf it was okay to muzzle Bakugou, a high ranking hero student, then it was only a matter of time before they came for the dangerous gen-ed kid with a villain\u2019s quirk.\u00a0\n\n\nHe had to make sure that didn\u2019t happen. He \n\ncouldn\u2019t\n\n let that happen.\u00a0\n\n\n---\n\n\nThe following Monday, when classes started back up again, Shinsou came to UA with a plan.\u00a0\n\n\nThe first step was to talk to one of the sports festival winners. He had to know \n\nwhy\n\n Bakugou was muzzled. Obviously, it was partially to do with how he acted, but what set him off? Had he tried to attack a teacher? Illegal quirk usage? There had to be an answer.\n\n\nAsking Todoroki wasn\u2019t an option. The guy was standoffish and cold, even on his best days, and typically had a lot of eyes on him. People would notice if Shinsou spoke to him. Bakugou was aggressive and pretty full of himself, so if Shinsou asked him, it was a fifty-fifty chance that he would either get an explosion to the face or be told to fuck off, if not both. That left Tokoyami. He was quiet and kept to himself, meaning he wasn\u2019t normally around crowds. He was a bit of a loner, so he probably wouldn\u2019t appreciate Shinsou talking to him, but he wasn\u2019t likely to attack Shinsou. He was Shinsou\u2019s best bet of finding out what happened.\u00a0\n\n\nSo Shinsou waited. He waited until lunch and scanned the cafeteria, as he did every time he came in there, searching for threats. Only this time, he did a second scan, looking for Tokoyami.\u00a0\n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t hard to find, tucked away in the back of the cafeteria. He was alone, at least for now, since most of Class 1-A was still in line for lunch. Tokoyami seemed to have packed himself a meal, and was peacefully opening his bento to enjoy it.\u00a0\n\n\nWithout money for lunch, Shinsou didn\u2019t bother getting into the line. He sidestepped his classmates and made a beeline directly for Tokoyami. As he approached, Tokoyami looked up. His quirk, Dark Shadow, peaked out over his shoulder, bright yellow eyes watching Shinsou\u2019s every move.\n\n\n\u201cMay I help you?\u201d Tokoyami asked, deep voice hard and cold.\n\n\nShinsou nodded. Carefully, he worded his question in such a way that it wasn\u2019t really a question, just as he did with everyone else he spoke to. \u201cI want to know why Bakugou was chained and muzzled. You were one of the only people up there with him.\u201d\n\n\nTokoyami raised one of his brows questioningly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhy do you want to know that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know some people who are concerned,\u201d Shinsou lied. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to repeat Bakugou\u2019s mistakes. I won\u2019t be telling them directly what he did, only what they should not do. I\u2019m not one to spread rumors.\u201d\n\n\nDark Shadow glanced between Tokoyami and Shinsou before coming out further, clawed hands gently touching Tokoyami\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want the medal.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDark Shadow! Hush!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt's not a big deal, Fumi. It's not like anyone else would do what he did,\u201d Dark Shadow said with a pout before looking back at Shinsou. \u201cHe didn\u2019t feel like he deserved it so he tried to refuse the award. He kept telling them no and trying to leave. Tried to push past them, acting kinda mean about it. Even set off his quirk a little I think. They decided to make him stay the only way that they could. Your friends probably don\u2019t have anything to worry about. Bakugou is a rule breaker, so this was a long time coming.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt's not right to talk ill of our brethren,\u201d Tokoyami scolded, pushing Dark Shadow back.\u00a0\n\n\nShinsou gave the pair a stilted bow as they started to bicker, cutting them off before it could get any worse. \u201cThank you. I will tell them they have nothing to worry about.\u201d\n\n\nAs he walked away, Shinsou knew he definitely had something to worry about. Sure, he followed the rules for the most part. What kid doesn\u2019t break a rule or two on occasion? But his record stated otherwise. He had a long list of detentions and suspensions, all dating back to early elementary school. It always went the same way, no matter what school he went to. Someone in his class would do something wrong, the teacher would start to lecture them, and then the kid would cry, saying that Shinsou made them do it with his quirk. The teachers never questioned it. After all, why wouldn\u2019t they believe the sweet kid with the nice quirk?\u00a0\n\n\nUA was supposed to be different. It was supposed to be safe here. But after seeing what happened at the sports festival, it was only a matter of time before everything went wrong again.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd so, it was time for the next step of Shinsou\u2019s plan: make himself as invisible as possible so everyone would just forget about him. He could disappear into the background, make himself as small and unnoticeable as possible. Then, the teachers would have no reason to muzzle him. Now that he knew what Bakugou did to get muzzled, he was already one step closer to being safe.\n\n\nShinsou just had to never ever say no to a teacher. They didn\u2019t like it. Don\u2019t refuse, follow the rules, and keep quiet. That\u2019s what Shinsou had to do to be safe. It meant that any chance he had of making it into the hero course was shot, since next year at the sports festival, he would need to get eliminated in the first round to keep attention off of himself, but if it meant not having to wear that god awful muzzle, then it would be worth it.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce lunch was over, Shinsou walked quietly back to his classroom. He sat in his seat and kept his eyes downcast, diligently taking his notes. He didn\u2019t raise his hand to answer or ask questions, and he kept himself curled and small at his desk. When the teacher asked him to help her move a heavy projector, he immediately agreed, not one word or sound of complaint slipping past his lips.\n\n\nQuiet, small, agreeable, and unnoticable.\u00a0\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t speak to another student until the very end of the day, when he was leaving the school to walk back to his foster home. Just past the gates, sitting on the edge of a curb and holding a small mirror to get a better look at his face was Bakugou. He was grimacing at his reflection, poking and prodding at a cut across the top of his cheekbone.\u00a0\n\n\nA cut made by the muzzle.\n\n\nShinsou was speaking before he even realized he had opened his mouth.\n\n\n\u201cHydrogen peroxide.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou startled, looking up at him and clutching the mirror tight to his chest.\n\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHydrogen peroxide,\u201d Shinsou repeated, gesturing to the cut. \u201cIt\u2019ll clean the cut and it's cheap to get. Tape some gauze over it and don\u2019t pull the scab off. Should help keep it from scarring.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you know about that shit?\u201d Bakugou snapped, standing from the curb and crowding Shinsou, a snarl on his face as he stood barely an inch from the taller boy. Shinsou took a half step back, startled, only to freeze as Bakugou\u2019s expression changed.\u00a0\n\n\nBakugou\u2019s eyes narrowed, moving across the thin scars on Shinsou\u2019s cheeks and nose. After a silent moment, Bakugou slouched backwards, growling quietly to himself.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got your own,\u201d he said quietly, glancing around.\n\n\nShinsou nodded, watching Bakugou warily. \u201cI do. You\u2019ll tell someone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTch. Like I have time to be talking about you.\u201d Bakugou turned to leave, his shoulders hunched near his ears as he started to walk away. After a few steps, he paused, just barely turning his head to speak to Shinsou again. \u201cYou said hydrogen peroxide?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah. It's going to sting but it works.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou nodded and continued his walk. Heaving a sigh, Shinsou started off home, trying to ignore the sinking feeling that he made a mistake talking to Bakugou.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen he reached the foster home he was currently staying in, he opened the door as quietly as he could, silently praying that the hinges wouldn\u2019t squeak. Kicking his shoes off, he made his way further into the house.\u00a0\n\n\nThe four younger kids, a set of identical twin boys and their slightly older sisters, were watching TV, all huddled together on the couch. Another boy, who was a few years younger than Shinsou, was at the dining room table working on his homework while his sister, just a year older than him, was in the kitchen working on dinner.\u00a0\n\n\nShinsou silently went to the room he shared with the other boys and slid his backpack under his bed. Padding back downstairs, he went to the kitchen and gestured for the girl to go join her brother. She did so immediately, avoiding eye contact and scurrying away to leave Shinsou to finish cooking.\u00a0\n\n\nEventually their foster parents came home. And just like every other night, the wife chain smoked into the late hours while her husband drank himself into a stupor. No one spoke to Shinsou, and like every other day, he carefully avoided speaking to anyone.\u00a0\n\n\nLast time he spoke, simply telling everyone dinner was ready, his foster mother had shrieked, slapping him across the face and knocking him to the ground. His foster father forced the muzzle on him, grabbed him by his hair, and dragged him to the hall closet, where he was locked in for the night. Shinsou didn\u2019t get food for two days after that.\n\n\nHe\u2019d learned his lesson though: don\u2019t speak inside the house.\n\n\n\u201cApparently 1-A\u2019s teacher finally got some of his bandages off,\u201d one of Shinsou\u2019s classmates said, skipping into the classroom excitedly. \u201cHis arms are still wrapped up but all of the bandages on his face are gone!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoes he look all messed up? I heard he got his face slammed into the ground by that thing that was as strong as All Might!\u201d a boy asked, perking up in his seat.\n\n\nThe girl shook her head. \u201cNah, he\u2019s just got, like, one scar under his eye. He looks way more tired than usual though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI heard he\u2019s been on a lot of medication. That\u2019s why he was in the announcers box at the sports festival. They didn\u2019t want him down near the fighting just in case he got hurt.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cToo bad. Maybe he would have been able to keep Bakugou from going feral like he did.\u201d\n\n\nSomeone else laughed, clearly agreeing. Before anyone else could say anything, their teacher walked in, signaling the start for class.\n\n\nFor the first time in a week, Shinsou raised his hand. \u201cSensei, I need to use the restroom.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGo ahead, Shinsou, just hurry back.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou barely waited for her to finish her sentence before he was out of his seat. He barely made it to the bathroom before he wretched, spitting up bile from his empty stomach. Before he left the bathroom, he took a moment to rinse his mouth with water, clearing out the bitter taste from the back of his throat.\u00a0\n\n\nHe was half way back to his classroom when a deep voice stopped him in his tracks.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the gen-ed kid that made it to the last event.\u201d\n\n\nIce ran through Shinsou\u2019s veins.\u00a0\n\n\nHe knew that voice.\u00a0\n\n\nThat was Eraserhead.\n\n\nAs in, the hero he had looked up to since he was a kid after he\u2019d managed to spot the tail end of one of his arrests.\n\n\nKeeping his eyes downcast, he turned around to face the heroics teacher. He gave a short nod.\n\n\n\u201cYou went out when facing Midoriya, right?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou nodded again.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou did well.\u201d\n\n\nThat was startling enough to get Shinsou to look up, finally making eye contact with Eraserhead.\n\n\nThe man was tall, though only a few inches taller than Shinsou. His long black hair was messy, though it was stringy, like it hadn\u2019t been washed recently. From what Shinsou had seen of the man, that was uncommon. Eraserhead did look more tired than usual, and a little scruffier, so if Shinsou had to guess, his injuries were taking a toll on him. The man\u2019s arms were still wrapped but no longer in a sling. A shiny, slightly puckered scar marred his face, curving below his eye. Overall, he didn\u2019t look bad for a guy who only a few weeks ago had been on death\u2019s door.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd here he was, Shinsou\u2019s idol, telling him that he\u2019d done well at the sports festival.\n\n\nEraserhead arched a single brow, acting almost amused. \u201cYou seem surprised.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou swallowed thickly. \u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t win, sir.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. Do you know why?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t strong enough.\u201d\n\n\nEraserhead nodded. \u201cCorrect. You weren\u2019t. Not entirely your fault though. Gen-ed isn\u2019t designed to train their students for fights like that. You could have trained on your own to build strength though. And you rely too heavily on your quirk. You need to think things through more, be more creative. After all, you don\u2019t see me going out on the streets and only using my quirk to fight villains, do you?\u201d\n\n\nShaking his head, Shinsou let his gaze fall to the ground again. He kept his breathing even, trying to fight back the urge to cry at the harsh, but true, words.\n\n\n\u201cYou want to be a hero, don\u2019t you? Are you serious about it?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou took a deep breath. \u201cYes, sir. I want to be a hero. More than anything.\u201d And then he waited. He waited for the barbed words telling him to give up on his dream. To quit while he was ahead. To choose something realistic.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAre you willing to put the work in?\u201d\n\n\nSilently, Shinsou nodded.\n\n\n\u201cGood. Meet me after school. I\u2019ll train you.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou gasped, whipping his head up to meet Eraserhead\u2019s piercing gaze again.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Shinsou asked, and then promptly cringed at himself for asking the question.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll train you. It\u2019ll be hard. You\u2019ll probably hate me most days. But if you put in the time and effort to learn, then I think you have a shot at transfering into the hero course. So meet me after school outside the teacher\u2019s lounge. We won\u2019t start the training today, since you\u2019ll need to speak to your parents about staying late after school, but I will give you the training plans you\u2019ll need to follow outside of school. It will include cardio, stretches, and a diet plan that you will have to follow to strengthen and protect your body. Will there be any problem with that?\u201d\n\n\nYes. There absolutely would be a problem. First, Shinsou didn\u2019t have the money to buy extra food, let alone the specific stuff that Eraserhead would tell him he needs to eat. Second, he probably wouldn\u2019t have the time to do any of the cardio or stretches, since he was responsible for helping take care of the younger kids in the home. The second youngest, the oldest girl, helped him, so maybe he could strike a deal with her that he would take care of packing all the lunches the night before if she would make dinner and watch everyone until he got home\u2026 Shinsou would have to be sure to be back before his foster parents though, since there was no way they would agree to letting him do this. He would have to stay up later at night, since he typically did his homework while he cooked dinner or while the other kids were using the shower, but he didn\u2019t sleep much as it was, so that probably wasn\u2019t a huge deal.\u00a0\n\n\nNone of that mattered though. Shinsou couldn\u2019t tell his teacher no. Kids that said no to their teachers were labeled bad kids. Bad kids got muzzled.\n\n\n\u201cYes sir, I can do that.\u201d\n\n\nEraserhead nodded. \u201cGood. Meet me after school. Hurry back to class now, you don\u2019t want to get in trouble.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou didn\u2019t have to be told twice. Without missing a beat, he scurried down the hall, making it back to his classroom in record time. It wasn\u2019t until he was back in his seat that it sunk in.\u00a0\n\n\n\nEraserhead was going to teach him how to be a hero\n\n.\n\n\n---\n\n\nBack at his foster home, Shinsou waited until the younger kids were getting ready for bed to pull his foster sister aside.\n\n\nKiyo was a quiet girl, only 13 but mature beyond her age. Like the rest of the members of the household, Kiyo didn\u2019t speak to Shinsou, though it didn\u2019t seem malicious. It was a rule in the house that no one was to speak to Shinsou, and so she followed it. Taping at her shoulder, he gestured for her to follow him to the bathroom. When she seemed hesitant, he held up the notepad he\u2019d brought with him that read \u2018\n\nI need to talk to you. I\u2019ll write everything down so I won\u2019t speak.\n\n\u2019\n\n\nKiyo nodded, though she still seemed nervous when she followed him.\u00a0\n\n\nStanding in the bathroom, Shinsou wrote out another note to her.\n\n\n\u2018\n\nI am going to be taking extra lessons after school starting next week. I\u2019ll be sure to be here before Mr. and Mrs. Ikeda get home but I won\u2019t be back in time to help make dinner. Could you do it and cover for me so I don\u2019t get in trouble?\n\n\u2019\n\n\n\u201cWhy do you need extra lessons?\u201d Kiyo asked, nervousness creeping into her voice. \u201cAre you doing bad at school? If they find out\u2026\u201d\n\n\nShinsou quickly shook his head and started to write again. \u2018\n\nNo, it's extra lessons to help me get ahead. It's because I\u2019m doing well that I get to do this. Please? I can make everyone\u2019s lunches the night before while everyone is asleep, that way you don\u2019t have to do it in the mornings. And then I can make breakfast for the little ones too.\u2019\n\n He didn\u2019t bother writing that he would make breakfast for himself and the older kids. They never ate breakfast, instead passing their measly shares to the younger children.\u00a0\n\n\nKiyo bit her lip, worrying it between her teeth. \u201cWhat do I tell the other kids?\u201d\n\n\n\u2018\n\nJust say I\u2019m tutoring someone. That way, if it does get back to the Ikedas, I can say that it's just until midterms or finals or whatever and then arrange to stop the extra lessons.\n\n\u2019\n\n\nAfter another moment of internal debate, Kiyo finally nodded.\n\n\nShinsou smiled widely at her. \u2018\n\nThank you! I promise I\u2019ll make it up to you.\n\n\u2019\n\n\n\u201cJust don\u2019t get caught, okay? I know we aren\u2019t close or anything, but I still don\u2019t like seeing them hurt you. It makes the little kids cry.\u201d\n\n\nWith one final nod, Shinsou slipped past her and out of the bathroom.\n\n\nFor once in his life, it felt like things were starting to look up.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\u201cOi! Troll Doll!\u201d a rough voice shouted, startling Shinsou from his thoughts.\u00a0\n\n\nHe\u2019d actually had a little money for lunch today and had taken his food outside to eat. Most people stayed in, since it was starting to get pretty warm out, making it the perfect place for Shinsou to go to hide away.\u00a0\n\n\nLooking up, he found Bakugou storming across the grounds towards him and the tree he\u2019d been sitting under. Shinsou looked around, trying to figure out who Bakugou was speaking to.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking to you, dumbass!\u201d\n\n\nWell, that answered that question.\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing out here, fuck-face?\u201d Bakugou growled, stopping in front of Shinsou and giving his small meal a disgusted look.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cEating lunch, obviously.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re outside.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt's quiet here.\u201d\n\n\nHe made a none committal noise and then dropped to sit beside Shinsou. \u201cYou\u2019re weird.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou actually snorted at that, one corner of his lip quirking up. After a moment of the pair sitting in silence, Bakugou finally spoke again.\n\n\n\u201cMy parents didn\u2019t give a shit,\u201d he said, his voice quiet. \u201cThey saw me on TV. They saw the cut. They saw me bandage it. They didn\u2019t say anything. You\u2019re the only one who has. Why?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou already know why,\u201d Shinsou said, taking another bite of his lunch.\n\n\n\u201cWhat, because you got muzzled before you think you know better than me? You think you\u2019re tougher or something? Come on, zombie eyes, lets fucking fight! I\u2019ll show you who's stronger!\u201d\n\n\nShinsou pulled away, looking at him with a mix of fear and confusion. \u201cWhat the fuck, no, I don\u2019t want to fight. I saw you and I was worried. You didn\u2019t look like you\u2019d ever been muzzled before so figured I\u2019d give you some advice.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow could you tell I hadn\u2019t been muzzled?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou still tried to move your jaw.\u201d\n\n\nThat caught Bakugou\u2019s attention. He glanced over at Shinsou, watching the slightly taller boy pick at his food.\n\n\nShinsou continued. \u201cI could see you up there, still trying to talk and yell. And then, when I saw the cut, it only confirmed to me that you tried to move your jaw. The muzzle wasn\u2019t too tight on your face, so it shouldn\u2019t have cut you. The only way it would do that is if you had been struggling against it. You learn after wearing them a few times not to fight against it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShit, you really do know about wearing those things. Your\u2019s went over your nose too, didn\u2019t it? The one they put on me didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou nodded. \u201cYeah, the one you wore is higher end and newer. They don\u2019t cover the noses on them any more because too many people suffocated. They\u2019d be wearing them, panic, and then throw up inside of it. Since they were panicking, they\u2019d be hyperventilating and inhale the vomit. It\u2026 it isn\u2019t a nice way to go.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd they still made you wear one like that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOnly option available to them.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou grimaced, ducking his head again. \u201cHow many times did you have to wear it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Shinsou said with a shrug. \u201cA lot. It kinda followed me wherever I got sent. Foster care is bitch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShit, and I thought it was bad for me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI mean, it was still bad for you. I could tell you were freaking out pretty hard.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou snarled, a few small explosions popping across the palms of his hands. \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared! I was pissed!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay. Doesn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t still losing your shit up there. I might not be the top student of my class, but I\u2019m up there. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d\n\n\nHe looked away again, avoiding Shinsou\u2019s gaze. \u201cIt\u2026 It reminded me of something. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been dumping my tragic backstory on you. Only fair you do the same. Go on then,\u201d Shinsou said, leaning back against the tree. When Bakugou didn\u2019t move to speak, Shinsou huffed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to, man, but I\u2019m probably the least likely person in the school to judge you. I don\u2019t give a shit and I don\u2019t really talk to anyone, so I won\u2019t be spreading the story around the school.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou took a shuddering breath before opening his mouth. \u201cI got attacked, right at the end of middle school. It was all over the news. This villain with a slime quirk grabbed me and tried to\u2026 tried to take over my body. He kept trying to force his way down my throat to suffocate me. Only reason I survived long enough for anyone to do anything was because I started setting off my quirk. It was enough to get the dude to back off a few times and let me grab some air. When they chained me up on the podium, with the muzzle on my face, it was like I was back there, grabbed by that villain. It felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe, just like with the villain, even though the muzzle had holes and my nose was uncovered.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Shinsou said, eyebrows rising. \u201cYou had a flashback. Those are rough. I\u2019ve had them a few times but it's been a while.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you do to make them stop?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI mostly avoid the things that cause them. If I\u2019m in one, I keep reminding myself it isn't real and try to do breathing exercises. Doesn\u2019t always work though. Sometimes, if I start to panic and it seems like I might have one, my body redirects it and makes me puke. Stops the whole thing in its tracks. Happened when I saw you in the muzzle and again when I heard people talking about it, actually.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou snorted. \u201cAren\u2019t you a big softie, feeling all bad for me. I don\u2019t need your pity.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pity you, dude. Mostly I\u2019m mad that none of the teachers put a stop to it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh same. Like, what the fuck, all the teachers saw that and thought it was fine? That\u2019s such bullshit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Shinsou said, showing any sort of emotion in his voice for the first time in the whole conversation. \u201cI thought UA was supposed to be different! They\u2019re always saying how they won\u2019t stand for bullying or quirk discrimination, and then the teachers go and chain a child! It makes no goddamn sense!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even attack anyone. I was telling them I didn\u2019t want the medal cuz I didn\u2019t feel like I earned it and I accidentally set off a few little explosions. I can\u2019t always control them, since they\u2019re caused by my sweat, but I\u2019m good at keeping them away from people. Had to learn when I was little so I could finally stop wearing the stupid quirk suppressant gloves my parents got me. But I guess the teachers thought I was threatening them or something.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou rolled his eyes, shaking his head. \u201cOh boo-hoo, I\u2019m a full grown ass adult who fights legitimate villains on a regular basis. This teenager is soooo scawy with his wittle fiwecwackers. Uwu, we need to chain him up so we feel safe.\u201d\n\n\nAnd for the first time in probably over a week, Bakugou laughed. Fully and truly laughed. His face lit up as he doubled over, laughing at Shinsou\u2019s mockery of the teachers. Shinsou watching him with a massive grin on his face, trying to remember the last time he goofed off with someone like this.\u00a0\n\n\nHe came up blank on any memories of having done this.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not so bad. What\u2019s your name?\u201d Bakugou asked, finally catching his breath.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHitoshi Shinsou.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Katsuki Bakugou.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTch. Of course you do, I\u2019m awesome!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure, keep telling yourself that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHuh?!\u201d\n\n\nShinsou burst into the training room, his backpack partially slung over one of his shoulders.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here, sir!\u201d he called, tossing his textbooks aside. \u201cI can change into my gym uniform, if you\u2019d like. Or I can\u2026\u201d Shinsou trailed off, having finally looked around the room and saw he was alone.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said quietly. Glancing at the clock, he saw that it was only a few minutes past school letting out. Sighing, he crouched down and pulled his rumpled gym uniform from his bag and made his way towards the locker room.\u00a0\n\n\nIt was stupid to think Eraserhead would be as excited about the training as Shinsou was. He had other things to do, he wasn\u2019t going to get to the gym right after the bell rang for the end of the day. He probably had other things he needed to work on for his actual, real students.\u00a0\n\n\nShinsou changed into his gym uniform and stepped back into the training room. A quick glance around showed that he was still alone, so he began stretching, following the routine Aizawa had written up for him to do. He was nearly done with it when the door opened and Aizawa stepped in, his head bowed and looking at the stack of papers in his hands.\u00a0\n\n\nHis arms were finally unwrapped, leaving him looking much healthier than the last time Shinsou saw him. His hair looked like it had been freshly cleaned and he appeared to be slightly more awake than before. As he strode in, he glanced up and spotted Shinsou, stopping on a dime and furrowing his brows.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d he said, staring at Shinsou.\n\n\n\u201cYes, Sensei.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here early.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEarly is on time and on time is late, sir,\u201d Shinsou said, parroting back what his various foster parents had drilled into his head as a child. The only part he left off was the very tail end: \u2018And late means a beating.\u2019\n\n\nAizawa gave a sharp nod. \u201cI appreciate the punctuality, but I had planned for you to get a jump on your homework before we started training. Don\u2019t want you falling behind.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t, sir, I swear.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood. Looks like you\u2019re almost done stretching. Once you finish, I want 10 laps. Get going.\u201d\n\n\nThe first day of training with Eraserhead was torture. Every inch of Shinsou\u2019s body was screaming, as though he were on fire. His lungs ached and his limbs felt like noodles. He gasped for air as he laid beside his backpack, struggling to catch his breath.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSit up, kid, it\u2019ll be easier to breathe,\u201d Eraserhead said, nudging at the kid. \u201cWhere\u2019s your water bottle?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 Don\u2019t have\u2026 one,\u201d Shinsou panted out.\n\n\nEraserhead frowned before walking over to his own things and pulling out a full and sealed bottle. It looked to be the type that students got from the vending machines down the hall.\n\n\n\u201cHere. Drink this. Remember to bring water with you in the future. We won\u2019t stop often for water breaks, but when we do, I want you to hydrate.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, Sensei,\u201d Shinsou said, gratefully taking the water and downing half of it in one go.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYour parents were okay with you staying after school, then?\u201d Eraserhead asked, watching Shinsou carefully as the boy continued to pant.\n\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t mind, sir. I just have to be home before 6.\u201d\n\n\nEraserhead nodded. \u201cSounds reasonable. Alright, we\u2019re done for the day. Make sure to stretch before you go to bed tonight and to eat plenty of protein. See you back here tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\n---\n\n\nIt had become something of a tradition for Bakugou to seek out Shinsou at least a couple times a week. He\u2019d shake off his rag-tag group of hero course friends and sneak away to find Shinsou at lunch. Typically, Shinsou would sit outside at lunch, or if the weather was bad, he\u2019d find a hall or empty classroom to hole up in. Some days he got lunch, some days he didn\u2019t, depending on whether or not he was able to scrape together enough money. Being the oldest of the kids in the foster house, he had certain restrictions placed on him, one of them being not to take the Ikedas\u2019 food for his lunches. Kiyo already was on a reduced lunch and it wouldn\u2019t be long before she got nothing. Occasionally, the Ikedas would throw some spare bills at Shinsou and tell him that was his lunch money for the week. He\u2019d usually have to make the money stretch for weeks at a time.\n\n\nNo matter where Shinsou went in the school though, Bakugou tracked him down.\n\n\n\u201cThe fucking gym?\u201d Bakugou snarled, stomping into the room with his homemade lunch in hand. \u201cWhy the fuck are you in here?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou looked up from where he was stretching, startled that the other teen had shown up yet again.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 uh\u2026 wanted to squeeze in a run.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes it is.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou snarled, dropping to sit on one of the bleachers. \u201cIts a fucking stupid answer. Do you like running or something?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot really, but I need to get in better shape.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight, cuz you want to get into the hero course.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou froze, his eyes leveled out ahead of him, avoiding Bakugou. This was it. This was the moment where Bakugou would turn on him. It always happened. Someone would start to get to know him, maybe start to act like a friend, and then they would find out about Shinsou\u2019s quirk and his goals. That\u2019s when everything went to shit.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYes. Said so at the sports festival,\u201d Shinsou grumbled, waiting for Bakugou\u2019s reaction.\n\n\n\u201cAnd your quirk. It's that mind controlling shit, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou snorted, opening his bento and stirring up the food to evenly distribute the sauce. \u201cI guess it's not the worst quirk out there. I mean, it ain\u2019t as powerful as mine, but it would probably work for the underground shit that Aizawa-sensei does. Let me guess, your quirk couldn\u2019t do shit to the robots at the entrance exam, right?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou nodded. \u201cI got a few points for saving some people, but that was it. I don\u2019t have a big, flashy quirk, so I get tossed to the side.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know, it's kinda bullshit.\u201d\n\n\nStartled, Shinsou finally turned to look at Bakugou. The blond didn\u2019t look up from his food, leaning down to scoop a bite into his mouth.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLike, there\u2019s this extra in my class,\u201d Bakugou continued around his food. \u201cShe\u2019s fucking invisible. Like, how the fuck did she get into the hero course? She\u2019s not a recommendation student and she fights quirkless. How\u2019d she take down robots? Makes no sense. At least she could do underground work or something, I guess. And then there\u2019s this pervert who all the girls complain about. They\u2019ve gone to Nezu a few times to try to get him to do something about it, but no one has done jack shit. His quirk is okay, but he\u2019s a whiney little piss baby with no backbone. Fuck, sometimes I just want to launch him into the trash can where he belongs.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo does that mean\u2026 I... \u201c Shinsou paused, reframing his words in his mind. After a moment, he spoke again, carefully avoiding asking a question. \u201cYou aren\u2019t scared of my quirk,\u201d he simply stated.\n\n\n\u201cWhy the fuck would I be? You and I both know that if you use it on me without permission, I\u2019ll blow your damn head off after. Anyone with half a brain cell knows better than to piss me off and you\u2019ve got at least two.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, yes, two halves of a brain cell. A grand total of one whole cell. You honor me, Bakugou-san,\u201d Shinsou drawled sarcastically.\u00a0\n\n\nBakugou threw a dumpling at Shinsou\u2019s head, which was promptly caught while Shinsou laughed. Not one to waste food, he popped it straight into his mouth.\n\n\n\u201cI meant you have two whole brain cells, fuck face! And that is high praise coming from me, so shut the fuck up. So what\u2019s your plan then, huh? Gonna get stronger and try to win the sports festival next year? Because good fucking luck, I plan to win fair and square next time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI just need to place. That way I have a good argument to get moved into the hero course. And I may not even need to do that. I, uh, kinda have someone training me right now. They think that if I work hard enough, they can get me into the hero course before the next sports festival.\u201d\n\n\nThat caught Bakugou\u2019s attention. He glanced over at Shinsou, eyeing him carefully.\n\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEraserhead-sensei.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe fucking hobo? He\u2019s training you?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou nodded. \u201cWe train after school and he gave me stuff to work on outside of school too. I\u2019m not always able to sneak out for my runs though so I decided to do them during lunch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fucking stupid idea,\u201d Bakugou snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ll be too tired to train later today if you run now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have the afternoon to let my muscles relax some. It's the only option,\u201d Shinsou said as he stood up, shaking out his legs and preparing for his laps around the gym.\n\n\n\u201cJust tell him you can\u2019t always do it. He can rework the program or something.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, that will go over really well, I bet.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou\u2019s face darkened slightly. \u201cOkay, good point. He\u2019d probably get pissy about it. Fuck, fine. Do your run. I\u2019ll sit here and watch or something. If your form is shit, I\u2019m yelling at you though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI would expect nothing less.\u201d\n\n\nWhen Shinsou finished his last lap, he was shaking and feeling almost woozy. Bakugou chucked a fresh, cold water bottle at him, smacking him in the chest and sending Shinsou stumbling backwards. Shinsou picked it up and smiled at Bakugou in thanks.\u00a0\n\n\nBakugou huffed and stomped off, grumbling about how stupid Shinsou was.\n\n\n\u201cStop. Just stop,\u201d Aizawa growled, watching Shinsou struggle through his warm up run. \u201cYou\u2019re slower than before. We\u2019ve been at this for 3 weeks and you keep getting slower. Why?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou was doubled over, his hands on his knees as he panted heavily. \u201cSorry, Eraserhead-sensei. I\u2019ll do better.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI told you that you don\u2019t have to use my hero name. Are you following the workout and diet plans I gave you?\u201d\n\n\nNo. \u201cYes, Sensei.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen you should be improving.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll stop the workout for today.\u201d\n\n\nWithout thinking, Shinsou straightened. \u201cNo! I can do it!\u201d Shinsou said, taking off at a dead sprint. He barely made it 10 feet before he felt something wrap around his waist and yank him backwards. With a solid thud, he hit the ground, knocking the air from his lungs. Looking down, he saw that Eraserhead had caught him with his capture scarf.\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Eraserhead said, walking over to stand above Shinsou. \u201cI said we were done. We\u2019re going to work on your quirk instead. So get up, go get a drink, and get ready.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou\u2019s stomach plummeted. He had been dreading this part. Sure, the talk with Bakugou about his quirk had gone well, but that was different. He was \n\nBakugou\n\n. He wasn\u2019t scared of anyone. Eraserhead was a pro hero, sworn to protect society. As soon as he saw up close, or god forbid experienced, Shinsou\u2019s quirk, everything was going to come crashing down. The training would end. He\u2019d get banned from the hero course. \n\nThey would finally muzzle him\n\n.\n\n\nOn shaking legs, he went and grabbed his water bottle and took a drink. The water tasted a little funny, probably because he\u2019d just been refilling the same disposable plastic bottle that Bakugou had given him a few days ago. Shinsou was pretty sure you weren\u2019t supposed to keep reusing the same disposable bottle, but he didn\u2019t much care.\u00a0\n\n\nEraserhead said bring water to every training session, and Shinsou was going to do just that.\n\n\n\u201cYour quirk is voice activated, right? Is it only when people respond to your questions or just to anything you directly say to them?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cQuestions are usually the easiest and they create the strongest hold on the person,\u201d Shinsou paused, trying to decide if he should tell the whole truth. Taking a deep breath, he decided he might as well tell Eraserhead. After all, in for a penny, in for a pound, as people say. \u201cResponses to none questions work too, but I don\u2019t usually tell anyone that. I have to intentionally activate my quirk, though. It isn\u2019t just always there, ready to snag someone.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa nodded. \u201cIts smart not to tell people exactly how your quirk works, not only from a discrimation standpoint but also from a heroics standpoint. People won\u2019t respond to you if they know that\u2019s how your quirk works. How many people can you control at a time?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou shrugged. \u201cI know I can control at least three, since that's how many I controlled at the sports festival. I can\u2019t brainwash them all at the same time though. I have to activate my quirk on them one at a time, not in a group.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing not many people have volunteered to let you test your quirk on them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlright, well we are going to test it today. I want you to put me under and then I want you to have me do a basic task, an advanced task, and then I want you to try to have me answer a question. Got it?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou blinked up at him, his tired eyes having gone round. \u201cY-yes, Sensei. Are you ready?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m -\u201d Eraserhead\u2019s eyes went blank, his body going slack and his face relaxing.\u00a0\n\n\nSwallowing thickly, Shinsou took a few steps back, putting distance between himself and the pro, just in case Eraserhead tried to hit him when he came out of the mind control.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cStand on one foot,\u201d Shinsou said.\u00a0\n\n\nEraserhead immediately did as he was told, balancing perfectly on his left leg.\n\n\n\u201cPut your leg down. Uh\u2026 use your capture scarf to grab the bleachers.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nEraserhead\u2019s scarf lashed out, catching one of the support beams of the bleachers. Eraserhead then went slack again, having done what he was told.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOkay, Answer my next question. What\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d\n\n\nNo response. Eraserhead kept staring blankly ahead.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSay your hero name.\u201d\n\n\nStill nothing.\u00a0\n\n\nThen, Shinsou had an idea. He sprinted over to his backpack and grabbed his beat up, nearly falling-apart notebook, along with a pen he\u2019d found on the floor in the hall the other day. Coming back, he flipped to a blank page.\n\n\n\u201cTake these,\u201d he said, holding them out to Eraserhead. The man easily took them, holding them loosely in his hands. Shinsou quickly took a few steps back again, keeping his distance.\n\n\n\u201cWrite your hero name.\u201d\n\n\nEraserhead made no move.\u00a0\n\n\nWith a groan of frustration, Shinsou decided to give it one last shot. \u201cWrite Eraserhead.\u201d\n\n\nThe pen moved across the page. In neat, evenly spaced lettering, was the word \u2018Eraserhead.\u2019\n\n\nShinsou let his quirk drop, freeing his teacher.\u00a0\n\n\nEraserhead gasped slightly, his eyes refocusing. Blinking a few times, he glanced down at the notebook in his hands. \u201cThat didn\u2019t feel like I expected it to,\u201d he said quietly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAre you\u2026 I mean\u2026 You\u2019re alright then, Sensei,\u201d Shinsou said carefully, watching every move that Eraserhead made.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d the man said, looking up. \u201cI expected to be completely gone when I went under, but my consciousness was still there. Just felt foggy and distant. I could hear your voice but couldn\u2019t really make out what you were saying at first. At the end, when you started asking questions, I was able to understand what was going on a little better but still couldn\u2019t really think straight. My guess is, your quirk allows you to control an individual's actions, but you can\u2019t make them think or speak. Means you won\u2019t be able to use your quirk to get information from people, but I can think of other applications. It seems like you may be able to instruct me to do some rather advanced movements, since you were able to have me use my capture scarf and write. Smart thinking, by the way, switching tactics to try to get an answer from me.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou felt his face heat up at the praise. He brought a hand up and rubbed at the back of his neck. \u201cI thought maybe if you couldn\u2019t speak, that maybe you could write answers.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was a good idea. Let\u2019s try again. This time, I want you to try to have me activate my quirk. Make sure I\u2019m not looking at you when you do it though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay with being brainwashed again?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course. Why else would I -\u201d\n\n\nHe was under again.\u00a0\n\n\nShinsou took a calming breath. Never had anyone asked to be brainwashed, let alone brainwashed more than once.\u00a0\n\n\nMaybe\u2026 Maybe Eraserhead, no, Aizawa-sensei, wasn\u2019t like the other teachers.\n\n\n\u201cTurn towards the bleachers,\u201d Shinsou said.\u00a0\n\n\nAizawa turned, leaving himself in profile to Shinsou. This way, Shinsou would be able to see what Aizawa was looking at and confirm whether or not he actually activated his quirk.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cTurn on your quirk.\u201d\n\n\nWithout hesitation, Aizawa\u2019s hair floated up and his eyes glowed red, staring straight ahead. After a few seconds, Aizawa still hadn\u2019t blinked, his quirk still active.\n\n\n\u201cBlink,\u201d Shinsou said, worried about making Aizawa mad if he kept his quirk active too long. Once the quirk was deactivated, Shinsou spoke again. \u201cLook at me and activate your quirk.\u201d\n\n\nAs soon as Aizawa did that, he was released from Shinsou\u2019s brainwashing.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThis means that those with emitter quirks can harm you if you have them activate their quirks and they aren\u2019t facing away from you,\u201d Aizawa said as soon as he\u2019d blinked the fog out of his eyes. \u201cHave you ever tried brainwashing someone over the phone? Through a megaphone? Anything like that?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou quickly shook his head. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay, well, I don\u2019t have a megaphone but I have a cell phone. Here, hand me yours,\u201d he said, holding out a hand.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt's in my bag, hold on.\u201d Shinsou dashed across the room and grabbed his phone from the front pocket of his backpack. He handed it to Aizawa-sensei, who looked at the beat up flip phone for a moment before typing in a number.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGo out in the hall and call this. Try to brainwash me when I answer.\u201d\n\n\nNodding, Shinsou took the phone and stepped into the hall. Wondering if Aizawa had actually given Shinsou his cellphone number, he pressed the call button.\u00a0\n\n\nIt rang twice before a deep and familiar voice picked up, speaking. \u201cHello, Shinsou.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHi. Can you hear me okay?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d came the clipped response.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cStand on one foot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Shinsou simply said, hanging up and walking back into the training gym. Aizawa was still standing there, phone to his ear. When he saw Shinsou come in, he hung up his phone and tucked it in his pocket.\n\n\n\u201cSo that didn\u2019t work,\u201d Aizawa said.\n\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if it would. People get brainwashed from my voice and if it goes through a phone, then it's not really my voice anymore.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa nodded along with his explanation. \u201cTurns it into an electrical signal. Makes sense. I\u2019ll still bring a megaphone sometime for us to test with. I\u2019m cutting training short today. I want you to go home and get some rest so that you\u2019ll be in better shape for us to practice sparring tomorrow. Tonight, I also want you to write a list of possible ways to trick someone into responding to you. Get creative. Also write a list of possible uses for your quirk. Got all that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, Aizawa-sensei.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood. Now, you have my cell phone number. Save it but save it under something inconspicuous. Use it to let me know if you can\u2019t make training or if you have an emergency. Don\u2019t give it out to anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood. Here\u2019s your notebook back. Go home.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou nodded and quickly scampered off, nearly buzzing with excited energy.\u00a0\n\n\nHe had Eraserhead\u2019s number! Him! The weird reject villain kid! Bakugou would be so jealous if he found out.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\u201cHey babe, how\u2019d it go with your mini-me?\u201d Hizashi asked, giving Shota a quick peck on the cheek as Shota passed him in the kitchen.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a mini-me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, come on, he kinda looks like you, you have to admit it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhatever. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about him,\u201d Shota said, leaning back against the counter. \u201cHave you ever noticed anything\u2026 off about him?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Like if he's a troublemaker?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Hizashi said, adding some soy sauce to the stir fry he was cooking. \u201cBecause he has always been a great kid in my class. Quiet, but I think he\u2019s just shy.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI just mean, have you noticed anything abnormal?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe if you tell me what you\u2019re looking for, I can help give you an answer.\u201d\n\n\nShota sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s not getting stronger or faster in the way that he should. He shows up to training exhausted and every day he seems to be slowing down when he runs. He never asks questions, either. He phrases them as statements every time. Only times I have heard him ask questions is when I made him practice his quirk today and he only asked the questions to use his quirk on me. And his quirk is strong, Zashi. I can think of so many uses for it. But he seemed\u2026 scared almost. Like he was scared of his own quirk.\u201d\n\n\nHizashi\u2019s normally smiling face was pulled into a deep frown as he stirred their food. \u201cHe\u2019s never asked questions in class either. His classmates aren\u2019t mean to him or anything, but I have noticed that they aren\u2019t particularly keen to work with him on group projects. You know how it is with mental quirks like that: people are scared. UA is a good school, but some discrimination does slip through.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know. I went to the damn school and experienced it myself. But it seems different with him. And he\u2019s smart. Really creative. When he figured out I couldn\u2019t verbally respond to him while under his quirk, he grabbed a notebook to see if I could write answers. I couldn\u2019t but he was able to direct me to write what he told me to. He was also smart enough to correctly guess that his quirk won\u2019t work over the phone or any type of projection technology. But when I complimented him, he seemed shocked and embarrassed about it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t really known for giving out compliments, Sho,\u201d Hizashi said with a half laugh.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStill. Also, the kids notebook and phone were in rough shape. Looked like he was cramming two or three subjects all into one standard notebook and the thing looked like it had been through hell. And when he handed me his phone, I realized he had a flip phone. And not the slightly more advanced ones like Uraraka has. I mean the most basic flip phone there is. I recognized it as one of those types that you pre-load minutes on instead of having a monthly plan. The plastic was scratched and chipped and the screen was cracked.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHis family may just not have a lot of money and can\u2019t afford it. What do you know about his parents?\u201d\n\n\nShota shook his head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk about them. All he said was that they were fine with him training after school as long as he was home before 6. Probably so he can have dinner with the family.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat means he\u2019s eating at least. If you\u2019re worried, I can keep an eye on him during his English classes. If I see anything else weird, I can let you know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks. That would make me feel better. Something just feels off here and I know how teenagers are. They aren\u2019t likely to say anything.\u201d\n\n\nHizashi nodded. \u201cYeah, things have to be bad before a teen will tell anyone. Why don\u2019t you see if Nezu will let you look at his file? Double check that everything looks okay there.\u201d\n\n\nEverything hurt. His ribs, his neck, his face, his arms: just\u2026 everything.\u00a0\n\n\nSince Aizawa had sent him home early, Shinsou figured he\u2019d use the extra time to go on a run. Even though he\u2019d done one at lunch, Aizawa was saying that he was getting slower, which was no good. If he got too slow, Aizawa would give up on him. So Shinsou did a quick run, working up a decent sweat. He still got back in time to help Kiyo finish cooking dinner and started in on some homework.\u00a0\n\n\nWith how much he had to do after school, Shinsou had to continuously stay up late, hiding under his covers with a flashlight to finish all his homework. His grades were still good, though he was getting less sleep than he had been before, even taking into account his insomnia.\n\n\nMaybe it was because he was tired, or because he was hungry, or because he felt so good after Eraserhead, his personal hero, had complimented him and his quirk, but he made a mistake.\u00a0\n\n\nWalking to the table, carrying one of the plates of food for the younger kids, he\u2019d accidentally bumped into Kiyo.\n\n\n\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d he said, giving her a quick smile.\u00a0\n\n\nImmediately, her face twisted in horror. His stomach plummeted as he heard Mr. Ikeda slam his meaty fist on the table.\n\n\n\u201cWhat did you just say, boy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d Kiyo hurriedly said, her voice jumping an octave. \u201cI apologized to him!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNow you have the girl lying for you!\u201d Mr. Ikeda yelled, staggering to his feet and lunging around the table to get at Shinsou.\u00a0\n\n\nShinsou shoved the plate into Kiyo\u2019s hands and then brought his arms up to cover his head as Mr. Ikeda rained blows down on him. Reaching past Shinsou\u2019s thin arms, Mr. Ikeda grabbed Shinsou\u2019s hair and wrenched his head back, making him look up into his face.\n\n\n\u201cI thought you learned your lesson last time, boy. You don\u2019t speak in this house! We don\u2019t want you controlling us!\u201d\n\n\nWith a hard yank, Mr. Ikeda threw Shinsou to the ground by his hair, knocking him into the wall in the process. A swift kick struck Shinsou in the side, making him cry out in both pain and shock.\n\n\n\u201cMaybe I need to beat it into you!\u201d\n\n\nThe kicks that followed were hard and solid. Blow after blow struck Shinsou as he curled as small as he could. In the back of his mind, he knew that if Aizawa-sensei could see him now, that he\u2019d stop their training immediately. No one wanted to train a weak kid who couldn\u2019t even stand up for himself against a drunk.\u00a0\n\n\nBut it was better this way. Mr. Ikeda was angry, and if he took his anger out on Shinsou, that meant none of the other kids got hurt. They could go to bed tonight without any bruises or scrapes.\u00a0\n\n\nAt some point, Mr. Ikeda kicked Shinsou in that sweet spot, right by his temple and knocked him out. When he woke, he was heaped in the bottom of the closet, muzzle tightly strapped to his face. His clothes were torn and bloody and his body was covered in bruises. He didn\u2019t even have to try the door handle to know it was locked.\u00a0\n\n\nGroaning quietly in the back of his throat, Shinsou shifted so he could reach into his pocket. Pulling out his beat up phone, he saw there was a new dent in the plastic. He rolled his eyes before checking the time, seeing it was morning, maybe an hour after he was supposed to leave for UA. If he had to guess, he figured he\u2019d been knocked out and had slipped into sleep at some point.\n\n\nHe probably wasn\u2019t getting out of the closet today.\u00a0 That meant he wouldn\u2019t be making it to school.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Blearily, he pulled up his contact list.\u00a0\n\n\nThere were only two numbers there: his social worker and Aizawa. He\u2019d done as he\u2019d been told and saved Aizawa\u2019s number as something that wouldn\u2019t tip anyone off to what it was.\u00a0\n\n\nHe\u2019d saved it as Floaty McFloat Hair.\n\n\nNot his most original work but it would have to do.\u00a0\n\n\nSilently, he debated what to do. He could text his social worker, telling her everything that had happened at the Ikedas. He nixed that idea quickly. Not only would she probably not believe him, but if he was moved to another home, it would almost certainly be too far from UA for him to be able to attend. He'd cycled through all the homes that would be willing to take him in the district, so this was really his last chance.\u00a0\n\n\nAnother option was to text Aizawa. He could tell the hero what happened and maybe, just maybe, Aizawa would come and help. That idea was thrown out as well. If Aizawa knew how weak he\u2019d been, his chances of being a hero were shot. Not to mention that Aizawa would be required to report the abuse and then he\u2019d be moved to another home.\u00a0\n\n\nThat left only one option.\n\n\n---\n\n\nAs Aizawa finished with his morning lecture to the students, a subtle ding sounded from his pocket. Freezing, he glanced down, wondering who was texting him during class. A few students started to whisper just as a second ding sounded.\n\n\nAizawa pulled his phone out, his heart beating faster wondering what emergency he was being called into.\n\n\n\nLoud Bird: \n\n\nHey, I just walked past 1-C and I don\u2019t see Shinsou.\n\n\n\n\nLoud Bird: \n\n\nYeah, he\u2019s definitely not here. Think he\u2019s alright? I worry about quirk backlash since he probably hasn\u2019t used it much.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBefore Aizawa could respond to Hizashi, another ding sounded from his phone, this time from an unsaved number\n\n\n\nUnknown number: \n\n\nHello, sir, this is Hitoshi Shinsou. I won\u2019t be at training today. I apologize for the inconvenience. I promise I will be there Monday. I will work out over the weekend to help make up for it.\n\n\n\nWithout thinking, Aizawa responded.\n\n\n\nPersonal phone: \n\n\nAre you sick? You\u2019re not at school.\n\n\n\n\nUnknown number: \n\n\nYes, sir. I\u2019m sorry. I swear I\u2019ll be better by Monday.\n\n\n\nAizawa snorted, shaking his head.\n\n\n\nPersonal phone:\n\n\n Just get some rest. You can\u2019t train if you\u2019re sick.\n\n\n\nHe quickly flicked back to his conversation with Hizashi.\n\n\n\nGrumpy Cat =^-_-^= : \n\n\nHe\u2019s sick today. Just texted me to let me know.\n\n\n\n\nGrumpy Cat =^-_-^= : \n\n\nDid you change my name in the chat?\n\n\n\n\nLoud Bird: \n\n\n:3 &lt;3\n\n\n\n\u201cAizawa-sensei, is everything okay?\u201d Hagakure asked carefully.\n\n\n\u201cYes, it was a text about a case I\u2019m on. Go get changed into your gym uniforms, we\u2019re doing quirk training today.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe class groaned.\u00a0\n\n\n---\n\n\nBy the time Monday rolled around, Shinsou was hoping that Aizawa had forgotten about him missing training. He\u2019d kept his promise to the man: once he was let out of the closet, he had done his stretches and had tried to keep up on his cardio. He still had a lot of bruises, including around his eyes. He\u2019d been hit in the face at some point, making his nose bleed and sending bruising up to his eyes. The muzzle hadn\u2019t helped, probably making the bruising worse than it would have been otherwise.\n\n\nKiyo had been kind enough to let him borrow some makeup so he was able to hide most of the bruising on his face. He was left just looking like his eye bags were worse than normal.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen lunch rolled around, he actually went to the cafeteria to buy lunch. His foster parents hadn\u2019t let him eat all weekend so he was feeling shaky and lightheaded in a way he didn\u2019t like. He\u2019d had to use a little money from the cash he\u2019d been squirreling away to save for emergencies, but he decided it was worth it.\n\n\nOnce he bought the cheapest meal he could find, he slipped outside to what he had come to refer to as \u201chis tree.\u201d\n\n\nHe sat down and dug in, eating like a starved man. Before he could get more than a few bites in, he heard a shout from behind him.\n\n\n\u201cThere you are, you rat bastard!\u201d Bakugou shrieked, sprinting towards Shinsou across the field. He was still in his gym clothes, backpack slung over one shoulder and bento in his hands. When he got closer, he threw his bag on the ground beside Shinsou and towered over the other boy, glaring down at him. \u201cWhere the fuck were you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAw, you missed me. That\u2019s sweet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut the fuck up. I spent my whole lunch period trying to find your dumbass and barely had enough time to eat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry. Wasn\u2019t at school and it's not like I had any way to tell you I wasn\u2019t going to be here.\u201d\n\n\nWith a snarl, Bakugou held out his hand. \u201cGive me your fucking phone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo I can give you my number and you can text me if you aren\u2019t going to be here. No point in me wasting my fucking time looking for you if you aren\u2019t even here.\u201d\n\n\nWhen Shinsou handed his phone over, Bakugou pulled a face at it. \u201cThis thing looks like it's from the dark ages.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt's the cheapest phone I can get. I pay for it myself, asshole.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou scowled at that but said nothing as he went to Shinsou\u2019s contacts. After a moment, he burst out laughing.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFloaty McFloat Hair?! Who the fuck is that?! That\u2019s fucking hilarious!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt's no one. Give my phone back.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t put my number in yet. Come on, who is this?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo one, leave it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m texting them,\u201d Bakugou said, already pressing buttons to do so. \u201cI\u2019ll make them tell me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d Shinsou shrieked, leaping off the ground to try and snatch his phone away. Within seconds, the boys were grappling in the grass, the phone discarded. It wasn\u2019t until Bakugou accidentally elbows Shinsou in the ribs that they stopped, Shinsou gasping in pain and falling to the side.\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck? I didn\u2019t hit you that hard,\u201d Bakugou said, sitting up from where he\u2019d been knocked in the grass.\n\n\n\u201cIt's nothing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d Bakugou snapped. He reached up and grabbed Shinsou\u2019s shirt and rucked it up, revealing expanses of bruised and mottled skin. \u201cOh fuck. You need to go to Recovery Girl.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, you do! Is that from training? Did Aizawa do that to you? Cuz if he did, I\u2019m blowing him the fuck up. He doesn\u2019t even do that to us, he shouldn\u2019t be doing that to you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, cuz I\u2019m too weak to take it. I get it,\u201d Shinsou growled, pulling away from Bakugou.\n\n\n\u201cNo, because you\u2019re a beginner. Is that where they came from then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Shinsou finally admitted while straightening out his shirt. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one more guess.\u201d\n\n\nAfter a moment, Bakugou hissed in realization. \u201cOh shit. Your foster parents? It's that bad?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI slipped up. I spoke to one of my foster siblings. Foster dad got pissed. Didn\u2019t help that he was drinking. Spent the weekend in the closet with the muzzle on after he beat the shit out of me as a reminder not to speak.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told someone? That shit is fucked up.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou gave Bakugou a pointed look. \u201cSure, I\u2019m going to tell my social worker or the school about getting beaten and muzzled. That won\u2019t give them any ideas of what to do to me.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou ran a hand through his already messy hair. \u201cShit, you\u2019re right. They\u2019re all useless.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI only have about two more years and then I\u2019ll be 18. I\u2019ll finally be able to leave and no one will be able to make me go back. I just have to hold out. This is basically the last foster home near UA that\u2019s willing to take me so I have to make it work.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI could see if my parents would let you stay with me.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou raised an eyebrow. \u201cThe great Katsuki Bakugou is offering to let lowly little me stay with him. The world must be ending.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you weren\u2019t bruised as fuck, I\u2019d punch you right now,\u201d Bakugou snapped. \u201cJust\u2026 You\u2019re like me. My parents aren\u2019t the best but they don\u2019t beat me like that. Mom just smacks me sometimes, yells a bit. That or they ignore me. They wouldn\u2019t let you live with us permanently, but if you want to get away from the foster monsters, you can crash on my couch or something.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Shinsou said with a small smile. \u201cThat\u2019s nice of you. I need to be there for the other kids though.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou nodded. Before he could say anything, a chime came from Shinsou\u2019s phone.\n\n\n\u201cOh shit, the text to Floaty McFloat Hair must\u2019ve accidentally sent,\u201d Bakugou said, a devious smile on his face.\n\n\nShinsou snatched the phone up and opened his texts. Groaning, he started to respond to the mess Bakugou had made.\n\n\n\nPersonal number\n\n: \n\nHey who the fuck are you? Cuz the purple haired fucker has you saved as Fliaenticrh oe)^icnmoeri pioqwc! Iewu.rcneu\n\n\n\n\nFloaty McFloat Hair:\n\n\n Do I want to know what this is about?\n\n\n\n\nPersonal number:\n\n\n I am so so sorry. My friend had my phone and decided to text you to find out who you were since I wouldn\u2019t tell him. I\u2019m really really sorry, sir.\n\n\n\n\nFloaty McFloat Hair: \n\n\nI\u2019m guessing there was a struggle for the phone.\n\n\n\n\nPersonal number:\n\n\n You would be correct, sir.\n\n\n\n\nFloaty McFloat Hair: \n\n\nHope you got a good hit in. See you at training after school.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nAfter that, Bakugou started showing up to eat lunch with Shinsou more often. He\u2019d watch Shinsou run his laps before forcefully shoving some homemade food at Shinsou, along with a fresh water bottle. Any time Shinsou offered to pay him back, Bakugou would explode, quite literally, and yell at Shinsou to stop looking down on him and to just eat the \u201cextra\u201d food so it didn\u2019t go to waste.\u00a0\n\n\nWeeks passed, turning into months, and Shinsou was learning a lot from Aizawa-sensei. They\u2019d added sparring to the rotation, and even though Shinsou lost, he learned new moves and got better at evading.\u00a0\n\n\nHe did catch Aizawa staring at the way he flinched though, or eyeing new bruises that would show up on his arms. Aizawa would ask about his family, wanting to know how everyone was doing. He\u2019d ask if Shinsou was getting enough sleep and if he was following the diet plan.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd Shinsou always gave him the answers he wanted. His family was doing fine, he got plenty of sleep, and he ate what he was supposed to.\u00a0\n\n\nThese were lies, but Aizawa didn\u2019t need to know that. No one needed to know. The only one who knew was Bakugou, and he didn\u2019t count, since he and Shinsou were the same.\u00a0\n\n\nOn days where his house was too loud, too violent, Bakugou would text Shinsou and the pair would meet at a park between their houses. They\u2019d sit in silence, sometimes helping each other patch cuts and bruises. Sometimes, when one of them needed to burn off some energy, they would do some light sparring. They didn\u2019t use quirks on each other, but they did end up talking about different applications of their quirks.\u00a0\n\n\nOne time, Bakugou even excitedly babbled to Shinsou about the awesome move he pulled off based on Shinsou\u2019s ideas. The warm bubbly feeling Shinsou got from the praise lasted him through the rest of the day.\u00a0\n\n\nBakugou\u2019s friends had started to pick up on the fact that Bakugou was hanging out with someone else at lunch, but every time they asked him about it, or tried to follow him, he\u2019d threaten them with a well timed explosion.\n\n\n\u201cI see you fucking extras all day, leave me alone!\u201d he\u2019d shouted, getting attention from the rest of the class. Aizawa and Present Mic were standing in the doorway, talking before they traded out for the next lesson. The pair looked up, already dreading what fight they\u2019d have to break up now.\n\n\n\u201cWe just want to know where you go, dude,\u201d Denki whined, flopping sideways on Bakugou\u2019s desk. \u201cYou\u2019re always ditching us for your mystery friend.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my friend! He\u2019s just a dude that I talk to about quirks and shit. Fuck off!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh! He must have a super powerful quirk like yours!\u201d Mina squealed excitedly.\n\n\nSero nodded. \u201cIs he an upperclassman? What\u2019s he like? Is he nice?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStop asking me questions!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome on, bro, we\u2019re just worried for you is all,\u201d Kirishima said, trying to defuse the situation.\n\n\n\u201cWhy the fuck would you be worried?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe just want to make sure you\u2019re okay. If it is an upperclassman, we want to make sure he isn\u2019t being a jerk and taking advantage of you or something. I mean, that\u2019s how upperclassman were in middle school so I just don\u2019t want that to happen to you here.\u201d\n\n\nAnd then, something strange happened. Both Aizawa and Mic\u2019s brows furrowed as they watched the scene unfold before them.\n\n\nBakugou\u2019s red eyes had gone wide, almost as though he was shocked. His mouth hung open slightly, completely silent. And then, Bakugou lunged out of his seat, knocking his desk and chair over, effectively dumping Denki onto the floor.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou assholes don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Bakugou snarled, his voice barely above a whisper. His hands were balled tightly into fists and pressed firmly against his own thighs. \u201cHe would\u2026 He would never\u2026 How dare you\u2026 Fuck!\u201d\n\n\nWith that, he stormed past his friends and made a beeline for the door, pushing between his teachers to get into the hall.\u00a0\n\n\nAizawa dropped a hand down on Bakugou\u2019s shoulder, trying to stop him, only to be thrown off, a crazed and furious look in his eyes as he stared up at Aizawa.\n\n\n\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going, Bakugou? You have class,\u201d Aizawa said.\n\n\n\u201cThe bathroom. Need to wash all the fucking nitroglycerin off my hands so it doesn\u2019t fucking go off.\u201d\n\n\nAs the teen took off down the hall, hands still pressed into his own body, as though he were afraid that he would hurt someone if he lifted his hands away, Mic turned to Aizawa.\n\n\n\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d he whispered.\u00a0\n\n\nAizawa hummed thoughtfully. \u201cI might have a theory. Talk to you about it later.\u201d\n\n\n---\n\n\nAt lunch that day, Bakugou pushed his entire meal over to Shinsou, silently leaning back against the tree and closing his eyes.\n\n\n\u201cThis is all of your food,\u201d Shinsou said carefully, eyes flicking between the bento box and Bakugou.\n\n\n\u201cI know. Eat it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut it's yours.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, and you aren\u2019t eating enough. Don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed how thin you\u2019re getting. We need to figure out a way to get you more food so you stop losing weight. That or we need to find a way to get Aizawa to rework your training.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou carefully picked up the food, his violet eyes round with surprise and confusion. \u201cWell\u2026 thank you. I bought some food for lunch today though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEat both the meals, fuck face.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou nodded, quietly digging in, savoring the homemade food and thinking about how this is the most he\u2019s eaten in one sitting in months.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThey asked about you.\u201d\n\n\nMouth full, Shinsou looked over at Bakugou, who\u2019s eyes were still closed.\n\n\n\u00a0Bakugou didn\u2019t wait for a response before continuing. \u201cThe extras that follow me around. From 1-A. They keep asking about you. Want to know who I eat lunch with. And then\u2026 today\u2026 they said something. I just\u2026 I got so fucking mad. They don\u2019t know it's you I eat lunch with, so they couldn\u2019t have known I guess and I don\u2019t think they meant it that way\u2026 but it reminded me of the shit you said your bullies would say\u2026 and I was reminded of how I was in middle school. Fuck, I was such an asshole. Still am.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou swallowed. \u201cI mean, yeah. You\u2019re an asshole. So am I. That\u2019s why we\u2019re friends.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou\u2019s eyes flew open. \u201cWe\u2019re friends?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI would think so. We spend lunch together nearly every day, we text regularly, we hang out at the park sometimes; that\u2019s stuff friends do. And whatever, you were an asshole in middle school. Be better now. We\u2019re young enough that we still have a chance to change. And whatever your friends said is nothing I haven\u2019t heard before, so you don\u2019t need to get pissed on my behalf.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey were worried that whoever I was meeting with was \u2018taking advantage of me.\u2019 That\u2019s what they said: \u2018taking advantage.\u2019 I think they meant like with homework help or information on the heroics course. But all I could think about was you telling me about all the times girls said they were scared of you because you might use your quirk to \u2018take advantage of them.\u2019 And next thing I know, my hands are sweating buckets and one wrong move would turn our classroom into a crater. I had to book it to the bathroom to rinse my hands so I wouldn\u2019t accidentally kill someone.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou winced. \u201cShit, yeah, that was poor word choice. They didn\u2019t know though. And if I was a girl, I\u2019d probably be scared of me too. It's normal.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt's not,\u201d Bakugou hissed, tiny pops coming from his palms. \u201cIf people would just take a second to talk to you, they\u2019d know that you\u2019re a sarcastic shitlord, but not a danger to anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t all be like you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t even how I normally act though! Usually I hate spending time with anyone. And you\u2019re the first person I have ever complimented on their quirk. I don\u2019t get why I feel so fucking comfortable around you!\u201d\n\n\nShinsou gave him a small smile. \u201cI blame the trauma. First time we had a conversation, we just trauma dumped on each other.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying we trauma bonded?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBasically.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou snorted, a smile creeping onto his face. Shinsou leaned over and gently bumped his shoulder against Bakugou\u2019s.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCome on, at least eat a few bites. Don\u2019t need you going hungry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhatever, you purple haired scarecrow.\u201d\n\n\nNeither boy noticed a dark haired figure watching them at a distance; close enough to see the pair laughing and smiling but not close enough to hear their words.\n\n\n\u201cHey, were you able to prove your theory?\u201d Hizashi asked as Shota came home.\n\n\nShota stepped further into their shared apartment and dropped onto the couch beside Hizashi. Almost immediately, their cat was crawling into his lap.\n\n\n\u201cYeah. Still a little surprised I was right.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGonna tell me about it?\u201d\n\n\nShota leaned his head into Hizashi\u2019s shoulder, closing his eyes. \u201cBakugou spends his lunches with Shinsou. The pair hide away from everyone else. They\u2019re\u2026 they\u2019re actually friends, Hizashi. I didn\u2019t think Bakugou \n\nhad\n\n real friends. He\u2019s always blowing up at his classmates and can\u2019t seem to stand them. It's like\u2026 it's like he's scared of them getting too close or something, I don\u2019t know. But when he was with Shinsou, they were smiling and laughing and goofing off. They looked like a pair of actual teenagers. Watching them reminded me of us in high school. They were sharing food and just\u2026 having fun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAw,\u201d Hizashi cooed. \u201cThat actually sounds pretty cute. It's probably good for the both of them to have someone to cut loose with. They\u2019re both so stiff in class. Think there might be something more there?\u201d\n\n\nShota gave a shrug. \u201cNo clue. I\u2019m bad at reading that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cVery true. You didn\u2019t realize we were dating until our fifth date when I kissed you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIn my defense, I thought that was how best friends acted. I\u2019d never had a good friend before.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know, babe,\u201d Hizashi said, planting a kiss on Shota\u2019s forehead. \u201cI\u2019m still a little worried about both of them, though. Bakugou is always so aggressive in class and I think that\u2019s just his cover for his anxiety. And Shinsou is nearly silent. Never raises his hand, even though I know he knows the answers to questions. And he looks so thin, Shota. Are you sure you aren\u2019t overworking him in training?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m positive. I actually rearranged it so that we are going at a slower pace through the program because he was losing so much weight. I keep trying to get him to tell me what\u2019s wrong, but he won\u2019t budge. I tried looking at his file, like you suggested, and it's weird.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean it's weird?\u201d Hizashi asked, shifting so he could look down at Shota better.\n\n\n\u201cHe has a massive list of disciplinary actions taken against him dating back to just after he got his quirk. That\u2019s also apparently when he was sent into the foster care system. He gets moved from home to home, from school to school, and the reason always has to do with him apparently being a troublemaker. But since coming to UA, there has been nothing. No detention, no complaints, just\u2026 nothing. He\u2019s a model student.\u201d Shota paused, heaving a sigh. \u201cIt's discrimination, clear as day. The home he is currently in is known for taking on difficult cases. There are seven kids there right now. A set of four siblings, considered a problem because they are extremely codependent, a pair of siblings that were known for running away if separated, and then Shinsou.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSounds like a crowded and possibly upsetting living environment.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing though. None of the kids have said anything to their social workers, even when asked about the house privately. The kids all have good grades and are all pretty quiet in class. I did some digging and actually found some notes about the two youngest kids, a set of twins, from their teacher, and she couldn\u2019t stop gushing about how polite they were and how sweet it was that they had homemade lunches everyday.\u201d\n\n\nHizashi\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cYet Shinsou has an ancient phone and barely usable school supplies?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot to mention the way he flinches or how scared he is every time I ask him to use his quirk. I\u2019ve tried everything to try to get him to talk to me, Zashi, but nothing\u2019s working. I just need him to tell me what\u2019s really going on in that house so I can do something.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you call in an anonymous tip?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have enough to go on. Maybe I should try talking to Bakugou. If he tells me something about Shinsou\u2019s home life, I would have enough to demand a home study be done.\u201d\n\n\nHizashi nodded, putting his arm around Shota and pulling him in closer to his side. \u201cYou\u2019ll get to the bottom of this, don\u2019t worry. Maybe you should have Shinsou go pick up those gifts you had the support department make for him. Might show him that you really do care and that you\u2019re here to support him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201d\n\n\n---\n\n\n\u201cShinsou,\u201d a deep voice called, startling Shinsou and making him drop the textbook he had been trying to pull from his locker.\u00a0\n\n\nAizawa was walking down the hall towards him, hands tucked into his pockets and tired eyes drooping.\n\n\n\u201cAizawa-sensei,\u201d Shinsou said nervously, shifting from foot to foot. \u201cGood morning.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMorning. You got to school early, I see.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I usually am.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good habit to be in. Are you busy at lunch today?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou blinked up at him, confusion clear in his eyes but not evident in his expression, which he kept carefully neutral. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be, sir.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood. Go to the support course department. Ask for Mei Hatsume. She\u2019s a first year student, like you, but she is the best they have.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight, she made it to the last event of the sports festival. I remember her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s her. Go find her there at lunch and let her know I sent you. I had some things made for you. She\u2019ll be able to give them to you and show you how they work.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou nodded, excitement building in his chest. \u201cThank you, Sensei.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa grunted in response and trapsed off, grumbling something about needing coffee.\n\n\nPicking up his fallen textbook, Shinsou grabbed the rest of the things he needed for the day, his mind started to race.\n\n\nMaybe, just maybe, Aizawa could be trusted. He\u2019d never hurt Shinsou, not even when they were sparring. Sure, he had to hit Shinsou sometimes when they fought, but it never bruised. It didn\u2019t even hurt, just mostly was a reminder of where Shinsou forgot to block. Aizawa would pat his shoulder, complimenting how quickly he caught on to new moves. He would praise Shinsou\u2019s creativity with his quirk, and he never seemed to fear Shinsou. He regularly had Shinsou practice using it on him, and even had begun talking about recruiting others to come help Shinsou practice controlling more than one person.\n\n\nShinsou had secretly wondered if he could ask Bakugou to come help him, but a small part of him was still fearful of Bakugou abandoning him. Shinsou couldn't, \n\nwouldn't, \n\nlet himself lose Bakugou, not when being around the boy set something in his heart alight. Not when Bakugou\u2019s hand would brush against his own when they walked at the park. Not when Bakugou wouldn\u2019t pull away when Shinsou leaned into his side when they stayed out late, the chilled air giving them both goosebumps.\u00a0\n\n\nShinsou couldn\u2019t lose all that he had, not when he only just got it.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\u201cBakugou, I need to have a word with you after class. Stay behind during lunch.\u201d\n\n\nA couple of the students in 1-A made mocking noises at Bakugou, poking fun and asking what he did to get in trouble.\n\n\nLittle did they know, Bakugou\u2019s was wondering the same thing.\n\n\nHis blood had run cold at Aizawa\u2019s words, turning his veins to ice. His stomach dropped and his chest seized as panic set in.\n\n\nWhat\u2019d he done wrong now? Was this because of when he walked out to wash his hands? He thought everything was okay after that! Why would Aizawa want him to stay if he hadn\u2019t done something wrong?\n\n\nBakugou started running through all of his interactions for the past week, trying to figure out what the hell he had done to warrant a punishment. The rest of the class filtered out, heading towards lunch and leaving Bakugou with Aizawa.\n\n\nShuffling across the room, Bakugou approached Aizawa, eyes downcast.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019d I do?\u201d he asked, voice low.\n\n\n\u201cWhat? No, you haven\u2019t done anything wrong. I wanted to talk to you about Shinsou.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou\u2019s head whipped up, surprise evident on his face. \u201cShinsou?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes. You two are friends. Actually, I am pretty sure you are his only friend. I want to know if he has said anything to you about his home life.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you asking?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned. He doesn\u2019t seem comfortable opening up to me. So I am wondering,\u201d Aizawa paused, taking a deep breath. \u201cI need to know if he is in any danger at home. Is he safe?\u201d\n\n\nBakugou\u2019s eyes were narrowed. He could feel suspicion creeping up inside of him. \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause I want to help.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\nAizawa was starting to frown. \u201cBakugou, I don\u2019t understand why you are being difficult about this. I just need to know if he is safe or not. Do you know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like any of your business.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBakugou -\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf he wanted to tell you about his life, he would,\u201d Bakugou snapped, cutting Aizawa off. \u201cSince he hasn\u2019t, it means he doesn\u2019t want to tell you. If there was something to be worried about, I wouldn\u2019t tell you. I\u2019m not a snitch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot a snitch for the people hurting him?\u201d Aizawa asked, his voice growing firm and angry.\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it sounds like. Why else would you say you aren\u2019t a snitch?\u201d\n\n\nBakugou balled his hands into fists, willing them not to set off any explosions. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need you to have anything to hold against him, you got that, old man? I know you\u2019re training him to be a hero, which he needs. But he doesn\u2019t need someone sniffing around in his business and fucking up his life.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBakugou, what you\u2019re saying leads me to believe that there is something in Shinsou\u2019s life I need to be concerned about.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a snitch,\u201d Bakugou growled one last time before storming out of the room, ignoring Aizawa\u2019s shouts telling him to come back.\u00a0\n\n\nBakugou didn\u2019t care. He just needed to find Shinsou. He needed to see him and know he was safe. He needed to hear his voice, hear his breathing, hear his laugh. He just needed Shinsou.\n\n\nBakugou\u2019s phone rang, pulling him from his spiraling thoughts.\u00a0\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t bother looking at the screen before he answered, aggressively snarling into the mic.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\nA sniffle came from the other person, but no words came.\n\n\nBakugou pulled his phone away from his head and finally checked to see who called.\n\n\nIn glowing letters read: Hitoshi Shinsou.\n\n\nBakugou held the phone to his ear again. \u201cTroll doll? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\nAnother sniffle and then a sob. Panic zinged through Bakugou\u2019s body.\n\n\n\u201cShinsou, where are you? I\u2019ll come get you.\u201d\n\n\nHe heard a choked off sob and then, in a croaking, strained voice, Shinsou finally spoke.\n\n\n\u201c\n\nBathroom. Near support.\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou shoved his phone back in his pocket and took off at a dead run, sprinting through the halls, flying past teachers and students alike, each of them calling out for him to slow down.\u00a0\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t slow down. He had to get to Shinsou and he had to get there \n\nnow\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for Mei Hatsume,\u201d Shinsou said, stepping into the support course classroom.\u00a0\n\n\nAn explosion sounded from the back corner of the room. A few support students pointed back towards the explosion, giving him a pitying look.\u00a0\n\n\nHeaving an exacerbated sigh, Shinsou walked back to find Hatsume.\n\n\nHe remembered her well from the sports festival. Her pink hair and loud personality made her difficult to forget. As he approached she looked up, her crosshair eyes scanning him over.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHitoshi Shinsou. Aizawa-sensei sent me. He says you made some things for me.\u201d\n\n\nHer entire face lit up. \u201cYou\u2019re who he was having those babies made for! Come here, let me show you!\u201d\n\n\nExcitedly, she pulled out a large metal case from beneath her work station, slamming it down on the counter and opening the lid.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThe first baby he wanted for you was pretty straight forward,\u201d she explained, pulling a pair of green sneakers from the case. \u201cNew shoes! They are a lot sturdier than what you can buy in a store though, and the toes are lined with steel! I also made the soles extra grippy, that way when you\u2019re running or jumping, you\u2019ll have better traction.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou picked one of the shoes up and felt a swell of excitement inside of him. As he did so, Hatsume glanced down at Shinsou\u2019s sneakers, immediately noticing how dirty and beat up they were.\n\n\nFor once, Hatsume decided not to say anything. In the end, it wasn\u2019t any of her business why a teacher wanted his student to have new shoes, especially when that student\u2019s current shoes were on the verge of disintegrating.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThink they\u2019ll fit?\u201d she asked, smiling at him.\n\n\n\u201cThey look to be my size, so I think so.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPerfect! Now, this baby was trickier,\u201d Hatsume said, pulling a bundle of cloth from the case. \u201cIt\u2019s a specific blend of alloys and fabric, making it super strong and lightweight. It\u2019ll take a while to get the hang of it, but if Eraserhead is teaching you, I bet you\u2019ll be swinging around on it in no time!\u201d\n\n\nShinsou\u2019s eyes went wide when he realized what it was.\u00a0\n\n\nA capture scarf. Just like Aizawa\u2019s. And it was all for him. He ran his fingers across the fabric, admiring how well made it was. The scarf was clearly high quality and was probably the nicest, most expensive thing Shinsou had ever touched, let alone \n\nowned\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cSensei had these made for me,\u201d Shinsou whispered reverently, Something warm and happy flooding his body.\n\n\nAizawa did this. He cared enough to have this made for Shinsou. To Shinsou, this loudly and clearly said that Aizawa truly believed Shinsou could be a hero.\n\n\nHatsume\u2019s smile grew. \u201cYep! I made them myself, so I know how awesome they are! Now, I\u2019m not really supposed to show you this, but I just can\u2019t help myself! He also asked me to make this for you, but he said it was a secret.\u201d\n\n\nAs Shinsou watched Hatsume pull the last item from the case, he felt his entire body freeze. It felt like a bucket of ice water had been dumped over his head. His heart started to race and a buzzing started at the tips of his fingers, quickly flowing through the rest of his body until he couldn\u2019t hear a thing.\n\n\nIn Hatsume\u2019s hand, plain as day, was a muzzle.\n\n\nA muzzle that Aizawa had asked her to make. A muzzle that Aizawa had wanted to keep secret from him.\n\n\nIt was made of harsh black metal plates, a mesh spreading across the front. It was shaped to curve up over his nose, just like the old, outdated one Shinsou had at home. The straps were made of thick, reinforced leather, something that would be near impossible to cut or break. It seemed to glare in the light of the studio, mocking Shinsou.\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t breathe. He could feel himself taking panting breaths, but the oxygen wasn\u2019t getting to his brain.\u00a0\n\n\nAizawa didn\u2019t trust him. All this time, all this training, and Aizawa still didn\u2019t trust him. He\u2019d had the muzzle made, clearly as a precaution incase Shinsou snapped; in case he went villain like everyone said he would.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore Shinsou knew what he was doing, his feet were moving, carrying him out of the room and down the hall to the nearest bathroom. He dove inside, locking himself into a stall and tucking his head between his knees as tears began to freely flow down his face. His hand was moving, pulling his phone out and calling the one person he could trust.\n\n\n---\n\n\nBakugou hit the bathroom door at full speed, sending it flying open. Inside, he saw that one of the stall doors was closed and locked, quiet sniffles and heaving breaths coming from within.\n\n\n\u201cShinsou?\u201d Bakugou asked quietly. \u201cIt's me. Just me. Can you let me in?\u201d\n\n\nThere was a beat of silence and then the lock on the door clicked open. Bakugou quickly hurried into the small, cramped stall and pulled the door shut behind him, locking it again.\u00a0\n\n\nShinsou had managed to cram himself between the side of the toilet and the wall, head buried in his knees and his hands balled in the fabric of his pants. His shoulders were violently shaking and a sheen of sweat glimmered on his skin, already cooling and growing tacky to the touch.\u00a0\n\n\nBakugou dropped to the ground beside Shinsou and reached out with a shaking hand to touch the other boy. Just as his fingertips brushed Shinsou\u2019s arm, Shinsou violently flinched backwards, whimpering in the back of his throat. He was aggressively shaking his head, burying it further into his knees.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cShit, is this a flashback thing? You said you get those. Listen, Shinsou, come on, listen to my voice. Can you do that?\u201d\n\nSlowly, Shinsou lifted his head. His face was red and blotchy, tears streaming down his face. His eyes were lifeless, staring straight through Bakugou as though he weren\u2019t there. Shinsou\u2019s jaw seemed to be clenched, as though he were pressing his teeth together as firmly as he could. It took Bakugou a moment, but he quickly realized why Shinsou was doing that.\n \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing a muzzle. I promise. You can open your mouth, okay? Come on, Shinsou, focus on me. You are in the bathroom at UA, with Bakugou. It's just us. No one can hurt you. I won\u2019t let them hurt you.\u201d\n\nShinsou peeled his lips apart, letting his mouth open ever so slightly. \u201cBakugou?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, it's me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be here. He\u2019ll hurt you. He\u2019ll put a muzzle on you! You can\u2019t be here. You can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Shinsou trailed off, eyes still vacant but starting to look panicked as his breathing started to pick up.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t in a closet. I promise, okay? Your foster parents aren\u2019t here. Just us.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Shinsou said loudly. \u201cNo, he\u2019s here. He\u2019ll muzzle you! He\u2019ll let them do it again!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShinsou, slow down. If you aren\u2019t talking about your foster father, then who are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAizawa,\u201d Shinsou said, his voice husky. Sorrow dripped from every word. \u201cHe had one made for me. It was supposed to be a secret. I found out. The girl. The support course girl. She made it and showed it to me. He hates me, Bakugou. Fuck\u2026 He hates me.\u201d\n\n\nWithout thinking, Bakugou bundled Shinsou into his arms. With a bit of maneuvering, he was able to tuck Shinsou\u2019s face into the side of his neck, letting the taller boy sob into his collar. Shinsou grabbed onto Bakugou\u2019s shirt, clinging to him as if he was his last life line.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI thought he was different,\u201d Shinsou sobbed. \u201cI thought he believed in me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck him. Fuck him and this entire fucking school. I believe in you. You\u2019re going to be a hero, I promise.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll never let me in the hero course, though.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou shook his head. \u201cThey have to if you place at the sports festival next year. You and I will train together and then next year, we\u2019ll work together in the first two events. In the third, you\u2019ll be strong enough to take down those fucking extras. Hell, I\u2019ll tell you things that will get them to respond to you. It\u2019ll be even easier for you to brainwash them. Until then, you have to stop training with Aizawa. We can\u2019t trust him and letting him know about your weaknesses is a danger. He was already asking me earlier about your home life.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou\u2019s body went rigid. \u201cYou told him, then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck no. I\u2019m not a snitch. I\u2019m not about to tell him anything he can use against you. I didn\u2019t want him to either use it to keep you out of the hero course or to get mad at you for.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou\u2019s grip tightened on Shinsou, leaning his head over to rest it against Shinsou. \u201cWhatever. We stick together. Trauma bonded, remember?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou chuckled through his tears.\u00a0\n\n\nThey spent the rest of lunch hidden in the bathroom, cuddled up against one another. At some point, Shinsou\u2019s arms migrated over to wrap around Bakugou\u2019s middle, pulling the blond even closer. By the time the bell rang, Shinsou had stopped crying and had fully come down from his flashback. His eyes were still a little red, but after splashing some water on his face, he didn\u2019t look too bad.\n\n\n\u201cWant to go to the park after school?\u201d Bakugou asked. \u201cWe can spar, if you need to get some anger out. Or we can just\u2026 walk and talk or some shit, I don\u2019t know.\n\n\nShinsou smiled and nodded. \u201cSounds like a plan. Thanks.\u201d\n\n\nThey went their separate ways, Shinsou back to 1-C and Bakugou to 1-A. As he walked into the room, about ten minutes late, all the eyes turned to look at him, including Aizawa\u2019s.\n\n\n\u201cThank you for finally joining us, Bakugou. Want to share with us why you were late?\u201d\n\n\nBakugou gritted his teeth, debating on lashing out at the man who had so badly upset his friend, or self preservation. If he yelled and screamed, he\u2019d get in trouble, and who knew what would happen. Aizawa couldn\u2019t be trusted, not anymore.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t hear the bell,\u201d Bakugou finally grumbled, shuffling over to his seat, still glaring at Aizawa.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let it happen again.\u201d\n\n\nNo one asked Bakugou why his shirt was so rumpled, or why its collar was soaking wet. No one asked why Bakugou seemed angrier than normal. No one asked why he had suddenly gone so quiet.\n\n\nShinsou didn\u2019t show up to training.\u00a0\n\n\nThe gym was empty, only Aizawa standing and waiting for the teen to show up. He tried sending a few texts, and when he got no response, he tried calling. He only got Shinsou\u2019s voicemail.\u00a0\n\n\nAnger burned in the pit of Aizawa\u2019s stomach, irritated that Shinsou was skipping training without saying a word to him. But, woven into the anger, deep down, was worry. Was he hurt? Sick? He seemed okay in the morning.\u00a0\n\n\nGiving up on Shinsou showing up, Aizawa made his way to the support department, hoping someone was still there and could tell him if Shinsou showed up at lunch for his new gear. When he stepped into the studio, he found Hatsume working on a project, motor oil and soot smeared across her face.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHatsume,\u201d Aizawa called, catching the girl\u2019s attention. \u201cDid Shinsou come here at lunch to pick up the support gear I had made for him?\u201d\n\n\nShe looked up, moving her goggles out of the way to see better. \u201cThe purple haired kid? Yeah, he came here. He seemed to like the scarf and shoes, but he got all weird when I showed him the persona cords.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa frowned. \u201cThose weren\u2019t supposed to be ready for another month. I asked you to keep quiet about them so that if they did work, we could surprise him with them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, well, I got too excited! And I finished them early. They totally work and they look so cool. I pulled it out and started to explain them but he just up and left. Like, he took off real quick.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDid anything else happen?\u201d Aizawa asked, feeling like he was missing something.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNope! Why?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNone of your concern. If you see him, let him know I need to speak with him.\u201d\n\n\nThe next person Aizawa tracked down was his husband, Hizashi. Present Mic was still holed up in the teacher\u2019s lounge, grading the various worksheets for his English classes.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMic,\u201d Aizawa said, getting the little weird feeling he always got when referring to his husband by his hero name. \u201cWas Shinsou in his afternoon classes today?\u201d\n\n\nMic looked up from his desk, his eyebrows furrowed. \u201cYeah, he was. Seemed a little off, but it was kinda hard to tell what's up when he barely talks. Shouldn\u2019t you be with him right now?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t show up to training and isn\u2019t answering his phone. I sent him to support today and apparently he acted weird and walked out. I\u2019m worried something happened.\u201d\n\n\nImmediately, Mic was packing his things. \u201cCome on. We can patrol the area and see if we spot him. If not, then we\u2019ll keep an eye out for him tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\n\n---\n\n\nThey spent half the night searching for Shinsou, only stopping when Hizashi happened to walk past Shinsou\u2019s home and saw the teen through a window, carrying a young child to bed. Not wanting to disrupt the entire house, Hizashi chose not to knock on the door.\n\n\nHizashi and Shota went to UA earlier than normal the next morning, wanting to be sure they caught Shinsou. Unfortunately, Shinsou showed up only minutes before the bell, far later than he typically arrived.\u00a0\n\n\nAll through the morning, Aizawa worried, wondering why Shinsou hadn\u2019t shown up to training. He was also getting worried about Bakugou, who alternated between sitting with his head bowed or glaring at Aizawa as though he had done something horribly wrong. As soon as the bell rang for lunch, Bakugou grabbed his things and bolted out the door, not even waiting for Aizawa to dismiss the class.\u00a0\n\n\nWith a sigh, Aizawa made his way outside, searching the grounds for Shinsou and Bakugou, knowing that the pair were probably hiding somewhere. Eventually, he found them at the same tree he had seen them at last time, sharing a bento that Aizawa recognized as one that Bakugou brought from home. Aizawa lengthened his steps, hurrying towards the pair.\n\n\n\u201cShinsou!\u201d he called out, catching the boys\u2019 attention. \u201cMay I have a word?\u201d\n\n\nAnd for the first time ever, Aizawa saw Shinsou\u2019s face twist in fear and horror. The normally stoic boy flinched backwards as he grabbed his things, as though he was making a run for it.\u00a0\n\n\nBakugou was on his feet within seconds, arms out at his sides as he put himself between Shinsou and Aizawa.\n\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to talk to you!\u201d Bakugou snarled, small explosions crackling in his hands.\n\n\nAizawa stopped in his tracks, brows furrowed in confusion. \u201cBakugou, are you threatening me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes, then yes.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou was standing, grabbing at Bakugou\u2019s arm to try to pull him away. \u201cIt's not worth it,\u201d he whispered.\n\n\nBakugou shrugged him off. \u201cYes it is. You\u2019re worth it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBakugou, come on!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBoys,\u201d Aizawa interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on here. How about we head inside to talk about this? Shinsou, I just want to know why you skipped training last night and refused to answer your phone. If you want to be a hero, you have to train for it, I thought we had agreed on that.\u201d\n\n\nThis seemed to make Bakugou even angrier. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need training from you! He can be a hero without your help! I\u2019m going to train him, and we'll show you!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBakugou, he needs a teacher to train him, not another student.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe needs someone who believes in him and trusts him! And that sure as hell ain\u2019t you!\u201d\n\n\nShinsou grabbed Bakugou\u2019s arm even tighter, yanking the boy hard enough to make him stumble backwards. \u201cStop it!\u201d Shinsou hissed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get in trouble. Lets just leave!\u201d\n\n\nWith a huff, Bakugou shot one final glare at Aizawa before following behind Shinsou.\u00a0\n\n\nAizawa refrained from following, trying to make sense of Bakugou\u2019s words.\u00a0\n\n\nWhy did they think Aizawa didn\u2019t believe in Shinsou? Or that he didn\u2019t trust him? It made no sense. Aizawa had been spending the past few months trying to prove he believed in and trusted Shinsou, and he thought Shinsou was finally starting to believe it. And then, in one night, that was all gone.\u00a0\n\n\nHe needed to speak to Shinsou. Alone. If Bakugou wasn\u2019t there, then maybe Aizawa would be able to get Shinsou to actually open up to him.\u00a0\n\n\n---\n\n\nIt took days before Aizawa was able to corner Shinsou. Every time he tried to catch Shinsou alone, Bakugou seemed to appear out of thin air, growling and snarling like a rabid guard dog. And every time Bakugou did that, Shinsou seemed to panic, grabbing the other boy and dragging him away, shooting Aizawa fearful looks.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat did these boys think he did? What did they think he would do?\u00a0\n\n\nAizawa would go to the training room every day after school and wait, hoping that Shinsou would show up. He never did.\n\n\nFinally, on Friday, Aizawa spotted Shinsou leaving school alone. He seemed to have stayed a little late, and from the chalk on his sleeve, Aizawa had to guess he stayed to help his teacher clean the classroom; a job that rotated through the students daily.\n\n\nWith no one else around and with Bakugou nowhere in sight, this was Aizawa\u2019s chance.\n\n\n\u201cShinsou! Wait!\u201d Aizawa called, breaking into a jog to catch up to him. \u201cJust for a second!\u201d\n\n\nShinsou jumped in surprise, his reflexes fast enough to catch the notebook that nearly slipped out of his hands. He looked panicked as Aizawa got closer, but didn\u2019t try to run; either because he was actually listening to Aizawa or because he was frozen in fear.\n\n\nAizawa stopped a good few feet away from Shinsou, giving him space in an attempt to help calm him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been coming to training and both you and Bakugou have been acting weird. Did something happen when you went to the support department? Have I done something?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou straightened, eyes narrowing slightly. The fear on his face seemed to melt into anger as he took another step back.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI saw it. The secret. Hatsume showed me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, she told me. Did you not like it or something? If you hate it that much we can redesign it. You can help with it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy the fuck would I help you design my muzzle?\u201d Shinsou snapped. As soon as the words were out of his mouth, his eyes went round and he slapped a hand over his mouth, realizing he\u2019d asked a question without permission.\u00a0\n\n\nAizawa didn\u2019t hesitate when answering. \u201cWhat do you mean muzzle? Is that what Hatsume told you it was?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou shook his head, slowly pulling his hand away. \u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t hear what she said. I just saw it and panicked. Had to get out of there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt's not a muzzle, Shinsou,\u201d Aizawa said carefully, taking a step forward. When Shinsou didn\u2019t move away, he took another step. \u201cIt's called persona cords. The plates shift and move so that your voice can resonate differently and come out sounding like someone else\u2019s voice. It\u2019d be a way for you to trick someone into responding to you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 so you didn\u2019t have a muzzle made for me? Just in case?\u201d Shinsou asked, nervously plucking at a sleeve both in fear of the answer and in fear of having asked questions.\n\n\n\u201cNo, I would never do that. I would never muzzle you, Shinsou. Why would you think I would do that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause you let them muzzle Bakugou.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa felt his blood run cold. His heart stuttered, and for a split second he thought it was going to stop. His mouth dropped open in shock as all the oxygen in his lungs seemed to leave his body, almost as though he\u2019d just had the wind knocked out of him.\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Aizawa said, barely above a whisper.\n\n\n\u201cAt the sports festival. He didn\u2019t want the medal. He kept trying to tell them that, and his hands were getting sweaty and his quirk accidentally went off. So, since he refused and was apparently acting threatening, they chained him to a pillar and put a fucking muzzle on his face,\u201d Shinsou spat, his anger back in full force. \u201cThey locked his hands in specially designed boxes to keep him from using his quirk. Do you know what that was like to see? What it was like for him? He still has nightmares. He\u2019ll wake up in the middle of the night thinking it's still on his face and he\u2019ll have to call me just so he can talk, to prove to himself he\u2019s not still muzzled. Why wouldn\u2019t I think that you\u2019d muzzle me? You let the other teachers muzzle Bakugou on live TV!\u201d\n\n\nAizawa\u2019s eyes flashed red, his hair flying up and his shoulders heaving with anger. \u201c\n\nThey did what?\n\n\u201d he snarled.\n\n\nShinsou took a frightened step back just as Aizawa blinked, turning off his quirk and trying to reign himself in.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cShinsou, I need you to listen carefully,\u201d Aizawa said, his voice deep and nearly threatening. \u201cI was heavily medicated at the sports festival and near the end, was having a bad reaction. Both Present Mic and I missed the awards ceremony because of how sick I was. Neither of us saw or were aware of what happened and neither of us watched the recording of it later. So I need you to explain, in detail, exactly what happened. That way, I can go and kill whoever did this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWait, you aren\u2019t mad at me?\u201d Shinsou asked in surprise.\n\n\n\u201cOf course not. I\u2019m furious with the teachers who thought it was alright to treat a child in such a way. No wonder you and Bakugou seem distrustful of teachers; you\u2019re in constant fear of being abused by us! I can understand why Bakugou wouldn\u2019t come to file a complaint about what happened, but why the hell didn\u2019t his parents call the school about this? They had to have been livid.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou shrugged, looking confused. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say anything to him about it. They didn\u2019t seem to think it was a big deal. Most people didn\u2019t seem to think it was an issue because of how Bakugou acts.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa pinched the bridge of his nose, sighing heavily. \u201cOkay, that is a whole other problem that I\u2019ll have to deal with.\u201d He looked back up, fixing Shinsou with a stern look. \u201cNo matter what you or Bakugou do, neither of you deserve to be muzzled. You are students. You are still learning. As teachers, it is our responsibility to help guide you and to keep you safe. UA has failed you both. But I promise, Shinsou, I will make this right. I need you to do one last thing for me. I need you to go to the teacher\u2019s lounge. Present Mic will still be in there. I need you to tell him what happened and I need you to tell him I have gone to speak with Nezu. Tell him I need him to find the footage of the sports festival and see if he can figure out who all was involved in making the decision to treat Bakugou like that. Can you do that for me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re going to talk to the principal about this?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMore like yell at him for it. I don\u2019t know what was going through his head that made him allow this to happen, but I\u2019m going to set him straight. Now, can you do as I asked you to?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou gave a curt nod, something akin to wonder on his face. \u201cYes, Sensei.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood. Then go.\u201d\n\n\nMic looked up when he heard a quiet knock at the teacher\u2019s lounge door. He was startled to find Shinsou standing there, looking extremely uncomfortable.\n\n\n\u201cShinsou! What can I do for you, little listener?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAizawa-sensei told me I needed to come talk to you,\u201d Shinsou said quietly, glancing around the room to make sure it was just them. \u201cAbout the awards ceremony for the sports festival.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, yeah, he and I missed it. Those meds sure kicked his butt. I went to keep an eye on him to make sure that he didn\u2019t get any sicker.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou nodded, seemingly satisfied with that response. \u201cHe said the same thing. He said I needed to tell you what happened.\u201d\n\n\nMic turned in his seat to better face Shinsou. \u201cOkay, why don\u2019t you come in and sit down. Close the door behind you, if you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou did as he was told, shutting the door and sitting in the chair beside Mic. Before he could get started on the story, Mic cut in again to speak.\n\n\n\u201cDoes this have anything to do with why you\u2019ve been missing after school training?\u201d When Shinsou gave him a surprised look, Mic smiled. \u201cYes, I know about it. I\u2019ve been giving Eraser advice on training vocal quirks.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2026 it does have to do with that,\u201d Shinsou said. \u201cHe had some gear made for me and one of the pieces looked like a muzzle. I freaked out and ran because I thought he had it made just in case I turned into a villain, like everyone says I will. When I told him that, he was confused and asked why I would think he would muzzle me. So I told him I thought he would because he let Bakugou get muzzled at the sports festival awards ceremony.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWHAT!?\u201d Mic shrieked, voice too loud for the small space. Shinsou quickly clamped his hands over his ears. \u201cSorry! Sorry, lost control! Keep telling the story.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBakugou didn\u2019t want the medal. He didn\u2019t think he earned it. And his quirk can accidentally activate sometimes, if his hands get too sweaty. Don\u2019t tell him I told you that though, he doesn\u2019t want people to know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Mic asked, cocking his head curiously. \u201cPlenty of people have quirk slip ups. You just saw me have one.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe gets in trouble when he does it. He\u2019s really good at making sure he doesn\u2019t hurt people when it happens though. But the teachers at the sports festival thought he was being threatening and dangerous and difficult or something and wanted to get the awards ceremony over with. So they chained him to a pillar, muzzled him, and put special box type cuffs on his hands to keep him from using his quirk. Then they put him out there on live TV for the whole country to see. When I saw it, I freaked out and thought it was only a matter of time before I got muzzled too, since Bakugou is a hero student and I\u2019m me,\u201d Shinsou explained, tears starting to well in his eyes. \u201cAizawa-sensei was so angry that it happened. He promised me that he\u2019d never muzzle me and said Bakugou and I should never have to be scared of that happening. He said he was going to go and yell at Principal Nezu. And he wanted me to ask you if you could find footage of the awards ceremony and try to see who was involved in what happened to Bakugou.\u201d\n\n\nMic\u2019s face had fallen into something sad and soft. Gently, he held his arms out and gestured for Shinsou to lean in for a hug. Slowly, hesitantly, Shinsou did just that. As soon as Mic\u2019s arms were around him, Shinsou went boneless, leaning into the teacher and sobbing.\n\n\n\u201cIt's okay, kiddo, it's alright,\u201d Mic said, rubbing his back. \u201cEraser and I will make sure that UA is held accountable for this. Thank you for speaking up.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou nodded, slowly pulling back. Mic looked down at the boy\u2019s face and froze, his arms locking up and keeping Shinsou from moving too far away.\n\n\nShinsou\u2019s face had turned bright red from the crying, leaving his skin blotchy. But there, faintly across the bridge of his nose and across the tops of his cheek bones, were razor thin scars, only barely visible now that Shinsou was so close and the rest of his skin was so discolored.\n\n\n\u201cShinsou,\u201d Mic said, his voice quiet and stilted. \u201cThose scars on your face. Are those from a muzzle?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou\u2019s body became rigid. After a beat of hesitation, he croaked out a quiet, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBuddy, don\u2019t lie to me. Did you and Bakugou become friends because you\u2019ve both been muzzled?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been muzzled.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know what muzzle scars look like, Shinsou,\u201d MIc said, raising a hand and gently touching his own scars, which matched Shinsou\u2019s nearly perfectly. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything unless you tell me the truth.\u201d\n\n\nA fresh wave of tears welled in Shinsou\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d find the people who muzzled you and I would lock them in prison for a long, long time. I would make sure you were safe and cared for. I\u2019d make sure you had the help you needed. And, speaking from experience, I am sure you would be worried about having to transfer schools if you moved. But I assure you, I would make sure you wouldn\u2019t have to leave UA. You won\u2019t have to leave behind Bakugou or Eraser. I wouldn\u2019t let this impact your chances of becoming a hero, Shinsou, I swear it.\u201d\n\n\nTears were streaming down Shinsou\u2019s face by the time Present Mic had finished speaking. He buried his face into his teacher\u2019s shoulder, sobbing hard enough that his entire body was wracked with tremors.\n\n\nAnd then he told Present Mic everything. He told him about the muzzles in all the different homes. The beatings by various hands of those who were supposed to care for him. The bruises and cuts and all the concussions. He told Mic about being banned from speaking and the daily restrictions on his food. He told him about the closet, and the flashbacks, and the fear. About the late nights doing homework after caring for the other kids and about using every bit of free time, including lunch, to keep up with Aizawa\u2019s training plan. He told him about sneaking out to train in the park with Bakugou, and how poorly Bakugou was treated, but that he and Bakugou had each other and they knew that was all they needed to make it to 18, when they\u2019d finally be free.\n\n\nAnd Mic listened. He listened as Shinsou poured out his heart and soul, weaving a disturbing image of not only his own home life, but Bakugou\u2019s as well. And once Shinsou had tired himself out, Mic gave him a tight squeeze, rocking them back and forth.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re safe now, Shinsou. I\u2019m not going to let anything else happen to you or Bakugou. Okay?\u201d\n\n\nShinsou silently nodded his head, trusting an adult for once in his life.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\u201cHe is a child!\u201d Aizawa roared, still pacing the Nezu\u2019s office.\u00a0\n\n\nPapers were scattered across the floor from where Aizawa had knocked them off Nezu\u2019s desk. Chairs were kicked to the side and pens were dumped on Nezu\u2019s desk.\u00a0\n\n\nThe principal quietly sat behind his desk, paws steepled as he watched Aizawa rage.\n\n\n\u201cHe is a hero in training. He is expected to behave in a certain manner,\u201d Nezu cooly said. \u201cBut I can see your concerns.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy concerns?! You allowed a child to be abused on national television! You of all people shouldn\u2019t be okay with this!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy? Because of my history at the hands of humans?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\nNezu tapped a paw to his chin thoughtfully. \u201cAh, yes, I can see the similarities between Bakugou\u2019s treatment and my own. I see how that could have been upsetting for him. Perhaps I acted rashly in allowing this to happen.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou think?! I want names. I want to know who came up with the idea and which of the teachers were near enough that they could have stopped it. And then I want you to scour the internet and remove as many videos, articles, and social media posts about the incident as you can find. And I want full permission to open an investigation into Bakugou\u2019s parents for neglect and possible abuse,\u201d Aizawa said, chest heaving as he finished.\u00a0\n\n\nNezu watched Aizawa carefully for a moment, mulling over what he said. Finally, the principal nodded. \u201cThose can all be arranged.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood. Now, if you don\u2019t want me going to every news source there is to tell them every little bit of dirt I have on you, you\u2019re going to do one more thing for me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh? And what would that be?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll let me finally expel Mineta and move Shinsou into his spot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, yes, that could have been arranged without your threat. Mineta\u2019s uncle on the school board will not be thrilled, seeing as he is the only reason Mineta has been able to make it this far in the heroics course, but with his stagnating potential and inability to stop harassing his female classmates, I believe I can make a firm argument for his removal from your class.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa nodded, seemingly mollified for now. \u201cText me the list of names. I\u2019m going to find Hizashi and Shinsou.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have the list before you even get to the teacher\u2019s lounge.\u201d\n\n\n---\n\n\n\u201cShinsou is coming home with us,\u201d Mic announced, already grabbing Shinsou\u2019s bag and pulling it over his own shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cI am?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou expect me to let you go back to a home where you get beaten, muzzled, and starved?\u201d\n\n\nAizawa\u2019s eyes flashed red for the second time that day. \u201c\n\nWhat?\n\n\u201d\n\n\nMic ignored him. \u201cShota and I have our foster licenses and as heroes, we can take emergency custody. We have a guest room in our apartment and you can stay there. I\u2019ll be calling child protective services as soon as we are in the car to let them know and to have them pull the rest of the kids from your foster home.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be going with the police to make sure your foster parents don\u2019t do anything stupid while we take them in for questioning,\u201d Aizawa growled.\n\n\nShinsou kept looking between the two in confusion. \u201cI still don\u2019t get it. You keep saying \u201cwe,\u201d like you live together.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, right. Forgot to mention that Sho and I are married. We don\u2019t talk about it in school, so please don\u2019t mention it to anyone. Come on, let's head to the car.\u201d\n\n\nBy the time they got back to Aizawa\u2019s and Mic\u2019s apartment, Mic had finished filling Aizawa in on everything Shinsou had told him. The pair had quickly gotten Shinsou settled in their living room with their cat, where he quickly fell asleep on the couch, exhausted from crying so much.\u00a0\n\n\nMic called child protective services, informing them of the situation, demanding that the foster parents be investigated, their license removed, and the children moved into other homes, but he also demanded that all of Shinsou\u2019s past foster parents and his social worker be investigated as well. Aizawa made a separate call to CPS, requesting a home check be done at Bakugou\u2019s house and requested that he be present for it.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce they had finished with that, Aizawa went to meet the police to head to Shinsou\u2019s foster home. He took a suitcase with him, along with an empty backpack, so that he could pack Shinsou\u2019s things. Mic stayed behind, getting the guest room ready and cooking some food for when Shinsou woke up.\u00a0\n\n\nThey were both already thinking about how to approach the other about making Shinsou\u2019s stay permanent.\u00a0\n\n\n---\n\n\nGoing to Shinsou\u2019s foster home was a nightmare. When the police knocked on the door, it was opened by a young girl, probably no older than 12 or 13. She was thin, far too thin for Aizawa\u2019s liking. She looked up at the gathered group with barely veiled fear. Behind her, inside the home, Aizawa could hear a TV, along with the sounds of arguing and a child crying. The scent of cigarette smoke tainted the air, along with the underlying smell of cheap booze.\n\n\n\u201cAre you here about the noise?\u201d the girl asked quietly, her words practiced, almost as though she had done this before. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we\u2019ll be quieter.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, actually, we need to speak with your guardians. Are they home?\u201d the lead officer asked.\n\n\nThe girl glanced over her shoulder, worrying at her bottom lip. Finally she nodded. \u201cI can go get them,\u201d she said, scurrying off.\u00a0\n\n\nAizawa could hear her trying to get someone\u2019s attention, saying that there was someone at the door. Suddenly, she was cut off by the sound of skin meeting skin. A sharp cry was heard and then a thump, as though someone had just hit the ground.\n\n\nHe was done waiting. Aizawa burst into the house, pushing past the officers who were also moving to get in.\u00a0\n\n\nThe girl was lying on the floor, tears welling in her eyes as she held her already bruising cheek. A drunk man, nearly twice her size loomed over her, shouting about how she shouldn\u2019t try to interrupt him. Behind the man was another child, this one a boy. He had a few bruises on his arms that looked suspiciously like hand prints, tears streaming down his cheeks. Two girls, slightly younger than the boy, were trying to help him up while a set of twin boys, the youngest out of them all, stood in the far corner of the room, behind a woman with a cigarette hanging from her mouth. The woman sat in a lounge chair, passively watching the scene unfold.\n\n\nAizawa\u2019s scarf lashed out, catching the man\u2019s arm and throwing him into a wall far away from the children.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck? Who the fuck are you?!\u201d The man shouted, staggering to his feet.\n\n\n\u201cSir, you are under arrest for child abuse,\u201d one of the officer said, pulling a set of handcuffs from his belt. \u201cIf you would just come quietly, we can discuss everything at the station.\u201d\n\n\nThe man lunged, swinging a large fist at the officer. Aizawa dodged in, blocking the wild punch and knocking the man to the ground. With a knee pressed firmly into the man\u2019s back, he leaned down to whisper in his ear.\n\n\n\u201cYou think it's fun beating on children? Starving them? Muzzling them? Does that make you feel tough? Have fun in prison, asshole. They\u2019re just going to love someone like you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck you, asshole,\u201d the man spat. \u201cYou talking about that villain freak? You should be locking him up, not me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs this about Shinsou?\u201d the woman asked, finally speaking up. \u201cHe\u2019s a liar! Always causing trouble!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that you hurt these children right in front of us. Let\u2019s go,\u201d one of the officers said, taking the woman\u2019s arm, handcuffing her, and leading her out of the house.\u00a0\n\n\nAizawa hefted the man to his feet, taking the handcuffs to cuff him, and then dragged him to the police cruiser, kicking and screaming. Another officer stayed inside with the children, helping them to pack their things to move to their next foster homes. Once the man was put in the car, Aizawa grabbed the bags he brought and went inside to find Shinsou\u2019s things.\n\n\nThe girl, the one who had opened the door, was standing in the living room, the injured boy clutched to her side and a bag for each of them at her feet.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d she quietly said, getting Aizawa\u2019s attention. \u201cIs Shinsou okay?\u201d\n\n\nAizawa nodded. \u201cYes, he is. I made sure.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThank you. I was getting worried. The Ikedas came home early and when they saw Shinsou wasn\u2019t here, they got really angry. He\u2019d said his extra lessons had stopped, so he\u2019d be home right after school, so I didn\u2019t know where he was.\u201d\u2019\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s safe,\u201d Aizawa assured. \u201cHe told us what was happening here. He got help for all of you.\u201d\n\n\nThe girl\u2019s eyes welled up again, her bottom lip quivering. \u201cCan you tell him I\u2019m sorry? I never really talked to him because of the rules and I always felt bad. I don\u2019t want him to think I did it because I didn\u2019t like him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he already knows, but I\u2019ll tell him. Can you show me where his things are? I\u2019d like to collect them for him.\u201d\n\n\nShe gestured for him to follow and brought him to a room that had two sets of bunkbeds. It wasn\u2019t a large room, and with all the furniture packed in, it was even tighter. The girl took the suitcase from him and told him to stay outside the room, since the two smaller boys were still in there packing and Aizawa likely wouldn\u2019t have fit.\n\n\nShe set the bag on one of the beds and began packing things into it. The clothes she grabbed were worn and old, the colors faded and holes mended. There were only a handful of items that looked like they held any sentimental value, which she carefully tucked in amongst the clothes to protect them. Shinsou\u2019s school uniforms, which looked to be the newest things he owned, were then placed on top.\n\n\nIn all, his belongings only filled half the bag.\n\n\nAfter making sure all the children were seen off to safer and more suitable homes, Aizawa made the trip back to his own, his shoulders drooping in exhaustion. Climbing the stairs to his apartment, all he could think about was how he\u2019d failed. He\u2019d missed all the signs with Shinsou and Bakugou. Bakugou, who reacted to his own abuse and neglect through anger to hide his fear. Who kept everyone at a distance, so that it would hurt less when they left him. Who had been treated as less than human on live TV and only one person had told him it was wrong. That person being Shinsou, who so clearly tried to please his teachers in an effort to protect himself. The fawn response, as Aizawa remembered it being called. Shinsou, the boy who kept as quiet as possible, did everything he was told to do, and never once complained, all in hopes of avoiding retaliation. No wonder the pair were so protective of each other: they complimented each other perfectly. Where Shinsou needed protection from peers and teachers, Bakugou could provide it. Where Bakugou needed help to get out of trouble, Shinsou could arrange it.\u00a0\n\n\nMaybe Hizashi was right: Shinsou and Bakugou were a lot like them at that age.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen Shinsou woke up, Aizawa had come back. He\u2019d dragged in a suitcase filled with everything Shinsou owned, which Shinsou was thankful for, but also embarrassed about. It was bad enough that his teachers had seen him cry and had seen he was too weak to defend himself, but now they also knew he had so little. Aizawa explained that the other kids were safe, having been taken to reputable foster homes, and that Shinsou\u2019s foster parents were in custody for child abuse.\u00a0\n\n\nShinsou nodded along with his explanation. \u201cWhere will I be going?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFor now, you\u2019ll stay here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t stay here forever. Is there a group home or something nearby? Then I\u2019ll still be able to get to UA.\u201d\n\n\nMic came into the room, plates piled with food balanced on his arms. He handed one to Shinsou and one to Aizawa before digging into his own. Shinsou looked down at his full plate in surprise, unsure of what to do with so much food.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to send you to a group home,\u201d Mic said around a mouth full of food.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve cycled through all the foster homes around UA.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot ours,\u201d Aizawa said without thinking. He then froze, glancing over at Mic, who just smiled back at him.\n\n\n\u201cI was thinking the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the space.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re saying I could stay here?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure, if you want to. That way you\u2019ll still be close to UA. Good thing too, since you\u2019ll be starting in the hero course soon.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou blinked at Aizawa in confusion. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA spot is opening in my class. Nezu and I have agreed it's yours, if you still want it. So, Shinsou, do you still want to be a hero?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I do\u2026 more than anything.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood. Then it's yours, as is the extra bedroom here.\u201d\n\n\n---\n\n\nThat night after everyone had gone to bed, Shinsou pulled his phone out and sent a text to Bakugou.\n\n\n\n\u2018We can trust Aizawa. Let him help.\u2019\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nBright and early the next morning, Aizawa, along with a social worker showed up at the Bakugou residence. A tall man with brown hair opened the door when they knocked. Somewhere behind the man, a screaming match was taking place between Bakugou and some woman.\n\n\nAizawa was reminded of the scene he\u2019d stumbled on last night at Shinsou\u2019s foster home.\n\n\n\u201cHello, are you Bakugou-san?\u201d Aizawa asked stiffly.\n\n\nThe man nodded. \u201cYes. May I ask who you are?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Shota Aizawa, your son\u2019s teacher. May we come in?\u201d\n\n\nTwo hours later, Aizawa and the social worker were leaving, Bakugou and a set of suitcases in tow.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile there hadn\u2019t been any signs of extreme abuse like in Shinsou\u2019s case, there was evidence of neglect. The Bakugous hadn\u2019t cared about the sport festival incident, going as far as to say that \u201cthe brat\u201d had deserved it. They let Bakugou run wild, only attempting to discipline the boy when he lashed out at them. On more than one occasion during the visit, Aizawa had heard Mitsuki Bakugou refer to her son as \u201cweak\u201d and degrade him and his quirk. Her husband had sat back quietly, not stepping in to agree with either his wife nor his son. He was just a passive bystander, watching everything unfold before him. Bakugou\u2019s parents didn\u2019t starve him, or lock him in closets, or muzzle him, but they never cooked for him, leaving him to fend for himself. They left enough money for him to buy food, or they would stock the kitchen, and then they would ignore him.\u00a0\n\n\nBakugou had admitted that his parents rarely spoke to him or checked to see where he was. They didn\u2019t take him to the doctor after the incident with the slime villain, an incident that Aizawa knew hadn\u2019t been included in Bakugou\u2019s file. Bakugou begrudgingly laid out the story of his life, a lonely one filled with fear and confusion. Always being called weak by his parents, but strong by his teachers, he felt conflicted. Any time someone tried to show him genuine kindness, Bakugou would panic, thinking that if the person got close enough to him, they would realize how weak he was. So he pushed them away. He kept everyone at arm\u2019s length. It was easier to be seen as aggressive rather than scared or weak.\u00a0\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until he met Shinsou that he found someone he could trust, someone who \n\nunderstood\n\n.\n\n\nIn the end, the social worker had told Bakugou\u2019s parents that she had enough here to open a full investigation, which could easily damage their reputation and the reputation of their business. They\u2019re options were to either go through with the investigation or to relinquish custody of Bakugou.\u00a0\n\n\nThey chose to give up custody.\n\n\nWhile the social worker finalized the paperwork with Bakugou\u2019s parents, Aizawa had helped Bakugou to pack his belongings, though the teen had decided to leave behind a number of things. Aizawa offered to come back later to get the rest of it, but Bakugou had just shrugged.\n\n\n\u201cShinsou told me to trust you. Told me to let you help,\u201d Bakugou had said quietly, looking down at his feet. \u201cI listened to him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you did.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere am I going to go?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe social worker will have to find you a foster home,\u201d Aizawa said, sighing. \u201cI will personally vet them and make sure it is safe. I can regularly check in too. I would offer to have you come stay with me, but Shinsou is already with us and we\u2019re having to fight social services to be able to keep him. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll let us take in two kids, at least not at the same time like this.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou scuffed one of his shoes against the floor, still not looking up. \u201cWhat if I know someone I could stay with?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho would that be?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cInko Midoriya. She was friends with my mom for a long time. But then I was an asshole to Dek- I mean, Izuku. Auntie had asked my mom to talk to me and teach me not to act like that and my mom basically said that it wasn\u2019t a big deal and called Izuku weak. So Auntie stopped speaking to my mom. She\u2026 she might hate me. Same as Izuku. But I know her and trust her more than I trust a stranger. If she\u2019s willing to take me, even if it's just for a night or two, I\u2019d rather that than a foster home.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa nodded. \u201cLet me make some calls.\u201d\n\n\nHe then left Bakugou inside to pack the last of his things and stepped out onto the front porch. It took him a moment to find the list of parents\u2019 phone numbers that he kept on his phone, but eventually he found Midoriya-san\u2019s number.\n\n\nShe answered right away, and when Aizawa briefly explained that Bakugou was being removed from his parents\u2019 custody and had asked about possibly staying with her, she broke down crying.\n\n\n\u201c\n\nThat poor boy!\n\n\u201d she sobbed. \u201c\n\nHe was so sweet when he was tiny, but as he got older, he grew so distant and cold! I should have known better! I should have said something to someone! Yes, bring him here! I\u2019ll make space for him!\n\n\u201d\n\n\nAnd so, when they left the Bakugou residence, they made their way to the Midoriya home. The social worker had gone into the dining room to discuss the process of fostering Bakugou to Midoriya-san while Aizawa sat with Bakugou and Izuku Midoriya in the living room.\n\n\n\u201cBoys,\u201d Aizawa said sternly, \u201cI understand there has been bad blood in the past between you two. I don\u2019t know the specifics, but I need to know if Bakugou staying here is going to cause more issues between you guys.\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya immediately shook his head. \u201cNo! Mom explained everything and it kinda makes sense. Bakugou didn\u2019t know how to make me leave him alone other than fighting with me, so I forgive him.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa glanced at Bakugou, who had his head hung, hiding his face.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too forgiving, nerd,\u201d Bakugou grumbled. \u201cYou should be angry. You should want me as far away from you as possible.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I am still hurt you acted like that, but you didn\u2019t really understand what you were doing, did you? And ever since the sports festival, you\u2019ve been nicer and nicer to me, which I still don\u2019t really understand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe purple haired fucker you fought in the last event knocked some sense into me. Made me want to be a better person. And\u2026 fuck he\u2019ll kill me if I don\u2019t do this\u2026 Izuku, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry for how I treated you. It was wrong.\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya\u2019s eyes filled with tears as he lunged across the couch and latched onto Bakugou in a tight hug. \u201cKacchan! That was so nice!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGet off me!\u201d Bakugou shouted, trying to shove Midoriya off while the green haired boy both laughed and cried tears of joy.\n\n\nLooking at the two of them, Aizawa knew that things would work out in the end. It would take time, but they\u2019d get there.\n\n\nWith Bakugou settled, Aizawa moved onto his list of teachers that he needed to have a word with.\u00a0\n\n\nThe first one on the list was All Might.\n\n\nAizawa smiled. He was going to enjoy this.\u00a0\n\n\n---\n\n\nSummer had rolled around.\n\n\nBakugou and Shinsou had a few days before they were scheduled to go to their training camp, which both of them were excited for, same as the rest of their classmates in 1-A. The other kids were all gushing about how cool it would be to be away from home, while also being worried about becoming homesick.\n\n\nNeither of the boys were worried though. Shinsou, who was freshly adopted, would have one of his dad\u2019s with him, while Bakugou would have his adoptive brother with him. Though Bakugou and Midoriya still butted heads sometimes, there was an edge of humor to it that hadn\u2019t been there before.\u00a0\n\n\nShinsou and Bakugou had gone to the park, the same one they used to sneak away to to escape their families. This time though, there wasn\u2019t a cloud of anxiety, or depression, or anger following them around. Instead, they were at peace, lying beneath a tree and watching the clouds through the branches. Between them were their linked hands, fingers tightly interlaced.\n\n\n\u201cHitoshi?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFor what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTrusting me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course, Katsuki. Thank you, for trusting me. And for believing in me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I believe in you? You\u2019re the fucking best there is. I wouldn\u2019t date you if you weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\nShinsou smiled, turning his head to press a kiss to Bakugou\u2019s cheek, making the blond blush.\n\n\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d Shinsou whispered.\n"
