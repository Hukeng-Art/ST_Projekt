    "text": "--\n0.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t raise you for serial monogamy,\u201d Winona Kirk says over tea. \u201cThat was Sam. You were supposed to be the child that lets me live through him vicariously when I\u2019m old and senile.\u201d\nJim winces. \u201cPlease stop.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a huge disappointment, kid. First you become a boringly good captain. Then you keep marrying the same person over and over again, like you had a stash of wedding magazines under your bed when you were thirteen or something.\u201d She takes a delicate bite of her crumpet. \u201cI cleaned out your room at least once a month and you never knew when I was coming, so I know for a fact, that they weren\u2019t wedding magazines, Jim.\u201d\nJim closes his eyes and wishes for a rogue band of Romulans to descend on them.\n\u201cWhat happened, Jim?\u201d She leans toward him, voice soft. \u201cHave I failed you, kiddo? Because if this is your version of a romantic gesture, it\u2019s pretty redundant, and you\u2019re not that much of a social spaz. Although, the time when you were mad about Ellie McLean comes to mind\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a damn accident!\u201d Jim snaps because there is only so much of this he can take. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose, it just happened!\u201d\nWinona eyes him skeptically. \u201cThree times in a row?\u201d\n\u201cFour,\u201d he admits miserably. \u201cBut who\u2019s counting.\u201d\nShe gives up the act and laughs at him outright. \u201cYou know, somehow my deep-space missions were never that entertaining.\u201d\nJim glares at her. \u201cJust for that, I\u2019m not telling you how to turn off the emergency transponder on a Klingon Bird-of-Prey.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem, I\u2019ll just ask your husband then.\u201d She smirks. \u201cI kept hoping for a nice Orion girl for you, Jim, but I suppose a Vulcan will do in a pinch.\u201d\nJim buries his face in his hands. \u201cPlease disinherit me.\u201d\n\u201cNot a chance.\u201d She eats the rest of the crumpet in one go. \u201cNow spill.\u201d\n\u00a0\n--\n1. \nThe first time it happens, they\u2019re just over a year into the five-year mission. Their orders, for once, are relatively simple \u2013 to formalize the first contact procedure initiated and conducted by the Tsiolkovsky and get the Velerians to sign the treaty, allowing the Federation to use one of their moons as a base. The Velerians prove to be good-natured and friendly, and incredibly easy to deal with, so Jim doesn\u2019t suspect trouble, until the High Governess announces:\n\u201cWe are happy to welcome the Federation into our family, Captain Kirk. All we require from you is a small token of trust between our peoples in the form of personal commitment. When a high-ranking Starfleet officer such as yourself joins the governing family of Veleri by marrying one of my daughters, our negotiations will be concluded and formalized.\u201d\nJim blinks, staring at the viewscreen, speechless. He can feel the bridge falling eerily quiet around him and turns to send a panicked glance to Uhura. She looks genuinely distressed but shakes her head at him.\n\u201cSorry, that wasn\u2019t in the briefing,\u201d she whispers.\nSo either the crew of the Tsiolkovsky had missed it or it didn\u2019t come to that before they left. Jim smiles at the screen nervously, buying time. If Jim refuses without a good reason, there\u2019s no telling how the Velerians might react, and he\u2019d be loath to undo all the careful work of both the Tsiolkovsky and his own crew. Doesn\u2019t mean agreeing to marry some alien princess is an option.\nHe looks at Spock who is standing next to him on the bridge, as has been his custom since the first time they were on a mission together, and inspiration strikes.\nJim grins at the governess apologetically. \u201cI must apologize, Your Excellency, but that won\u2019t be possible. Believe me,\u201d he adds quickly as she begins to frown, \u201cnothing could have pleased me more than to become a husband to one of your lovely daughters. Unfortunately, I\u2019m prevented from accepting this honor.\u201d\n\u201cPrevented by what, Captain Kirk?\u201d\n\u201cBy Federation law, Your Excellency,\u201d he explains, trying to convey sincere regret. \u201cYou see, I am a Terran citizen, and on Earth it is forbidden to be married to more than one person at the same time.\u201d He steps closer to Spock and puts an arm around his shoulders. \u201cAs I am already married to Commander Spock here, I cannot, in good conscience accept.\u201d\nHe feels Spock go rigid beside him and turn to stare at him at point blank range. Jim swallows hard and doesn\u2019t dare look at him. The bridge goes somehow more quiet at this pronouncement, a distinctive flavor of shock coloring the silence.\n\u201cI see,\u201d the governess says slowly, not looking happy about it, but her frown is disappearing, so Jim has obviously struck the right chord. \u201cIf that is the case, we will await your offer of a substitution.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Jim nods eagerly. \u201cI will talk to my superiors and contact you shortly.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t take too long, Captain. Any further delay will be considered a sign of disrespect.\u201d With that parting shot, she signs off.\nThe moment the screen goes dark, Spock steps away from him and turns toward him fully, glaring.\nJim throws his hands up. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry! I had to get out of it somehow.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this simply happened to be the first idea that came to your mind?\u201d Spock asks acidly. \n\u201cYes \u2013 well, she surprised me! I guess I could have told her I\u2019m sworn to celibacy for religious reasons or have an embarrassing disease or something\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA mental affliction would have been a more fitting choice,\u201d Spock supplies.\n\u201c\u2014but I had virtually no time to think, and you were standing right there!\u201d Jim finishes, generously ignoring Spock\u2019s comment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable.\u201d\n\u201cUncomfortable? Not at all. Why would I be uncomfortable with lying, Captain?\u201d\nJim frowns. \u201cOkay, I get it, you\u2019re pissed, but you need to get over it. It\u2019s not like this is the first time you had to deceive someone in the line of duty, so really, Spock, get off your high horse. Sometimes my solutions will be illogical. Yes, I know, probably most of the time, put that eyebrow down. If I remember correctly, you volunteered to serve with me, so you\u2019ll have to deal.\u201d\nSpock\u2019s expression closes off completely as he comes to attention. The bridge feels chilly all of a sudden.\n\u201cIndeed, sir. If there is nothing else, I request permission to leave the bridge, Captain. My presence is required in Science Lab 9.\u201d\nJim glares at him some more before nodding. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n\u201cSir.\u201d Spock marches off, utterly correct and stiff as a statue.\nOnly when the turbolift doors close behind him, does Jim exhale. Abruptly remembering there\u2019s a bridge full of people around him, he catches Sulu\u2019s eye. \n\u201cIt was that bad, huh?\u201d\n\u201cUnorthodox, but inspired, Captain.\u201d The helmsman grins at him. \n\u201cYeah?\u201d Jim drawls, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cThen why do I get the feeling I\u2019ll be sleeping on the couch tonight?\u201d he mutters, looking after Spock.\nThere\u2019s a sound very much like a giggle coming from the navigation station, and Jim whirls on Chekov.\n\u201cAre you laughing at your commanding officer, Mr. Chekov?\u201d\nThe ensign straightens instantly, caught off guard. \u201cNo, sir!\u201d\n\u201cGood, because I\u2019ve been thinking who to assign to the next sanitation rotation all morning. The maintenance crew is always understaffed.\u201d\nChekov goes pale and busies himself with his console. Jim smothers a grin and crosses over to his chair. Uhura is glaring at him, not that he had any doubt she would, but she also looks concerned when she sneaks a few glances in the direction Spock has departed. Jim wonders what that is about, but doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll tell him if he asks her now. \nIt doesn\u2019t quite end there. The Velerians insist on entertaining their guests while they\u2019re all waiting for Starfleet to send them a new envoy. Which means that Jim has to order Spock to the transporter room and down to the planet along with the rest of his senior officers.\nSpock complies with no comment on the matter. Jim is a little nervous that Spock\u2019s attitude will inadvertently give them away, but it turns out he needn\u2019t have worried. \nDown on the planet, all through the tour and the banquet that follows, Spock accompanies Jim dutifully. They don\u2019t hold hands or anything like that, but Spock keeps closer to him than he normally would and very occasionally calls him by his name instead of his title when the conversation drifts to subjects outside the official negotiations \u2013 an almost natural time for a \u2018slip\u2019 in formality. He enquires after the composition of dishes served, explaining politely that Jim has many allergies. In short, he creates every impression of a somewhat reserved \u2013 as befits his species \u2013 but completely sincere spouse.\nJim of course is a nervous wreck throughout, waiting for the other shoe to drop.\nThe moment they are beamed back to the ship, Spock turns off his amicable routine like a light. His tone is freezing cold as he excuses himself to finish the mission report and he doesn\u2019t actually wait for Jim to dismiss him before leaving. For the next two weeks, he invariably declines every invitation Jim extends toward him, whether it\u2019s to complete their paperwork together, visit the ship\u2019s pool, join Jim for lunch, or play a game of chess. \nJim has almost lost all hope of ever regaining lost ground in his relationship with his first officer, when Spock shows up in his quarters late into the Gamma shift one night.\n\u201cI hope I am not disturbing you, Captain,\u201d he says when Jim opens the door. \u201cI am aware that the hour is late, but I have hoped to speak with you.\u201d\n\u201cI always have time for you, Mr. Spock,\u201d Jim says honestly, stepping aside. \u201cCome on in.\u201d\nTrue to his nature, Spock doesn\u2019t waste any time beating around the bush. Coming to a species of parade-rest in the middle of Jim\u2019s quarters, he says, \u201cCaptain, I wish to apologize for my behavior of these past two weeks. I am aware that this newfound tension between us is largely my doing, and I have found the situation quite intolerable.\u201d\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d Jim sighs. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just me then.\u201d\n\u201cNegative.\u201d\n\u201cWould you care to sit down?\u201d\nSpock looks reluctant, but acquiesces, folding himself neatly into Jim\u2019s guest chair. \n\u201cMy reaction was perhaps not unwarranted, but my persistence in it quite illogical,\u201d Spock continues. He looks up at Jim almost hesitantly. \u201cI wish to explain.\u201d\nJim splays his hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. As you said, I deserved it. But if you want to talk about it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOur working relationship is valuable to me,\u201d Spock states in his usual straightforward manner that never fails to give Jim heart palpitations. \u201cI wish to clarify the situation so that it would not suffer.\u201d\nClearing his throat, Jim admits, \u201cIt\u2019s valuable to me as well, Mr. Spock. I\u2019m sorry if I have upset the balance.\u201d\n\u201cThe fault is not yours, Captain. Your solution was unquestionably unorthodox, but I have been familiar with your particular brand of problem-solving since our first mission together.\u201d\nAt that, Jim grins and translates, \u201cIn other words, I\u2019m an insensitive asshole who takes everything lightly, but you\u2019ve met me, so it shouldn\u2019t have ruffled your feathers quite that much.\u201d\nSpock lifts an eyebrow, a hint of amusement in his dark eyes. \u201cEssentially correct.\u201d The glimmer of mirth fades. \u201cI was initially disconcerted by the ruse you had suggested because humans and Vulcans view the institution of marriage very differently. For humans, it is quite within the norm to have multiple marriages throughout their lives as well as a great number of extramarital relationships. Even if a certain individual would choose to never enter matrimony, it would still be within the cultural tradition. Vulcans, on the other hand, generally mate for life. The only acceptable reason for creating another marital bond is the death of the spouse. Dissolutions for other reasons are extremely rare.\u201d He pauses, studying Jim\u2019s expression. \u201cI do not point that out as a demonstration of the moral superiority of my species, Captain. Such judgment would be illogical. I merely say that this is one of the cultural differences between us.\u201d\nJim smiles softly. \u201cI get it, don\u2019t worry. Carry on.\u201d\n\u201cIn Vulcan society,\u201d Spock continues, \u201ca marital bond serves a very distinctive purpose. It facilitates the fulfillment of a biological imperative. The social function comes secondary. This is why an unbonded adult Vulcan, unless he is a Kolihnaru master, is more than an aberration \u2013 it is an impossibility, an error that requires correction. It is not a matter of personal choice, but rather of a person\u2019s fitness to survive. This is why all Vulcan children are bonded at the age of seven. We do not leave anything to chance.\u201d\nJim blinks. \u201cDoes this mean that you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI was no exception, yes, Captain.\u201d\n\u201cNo way, you had a wife?\u201d\nSpock\u2019s face registers professional irritation of a linguist who\u2019s dissatisfied with an inadequate translation. \u201cThere is no equivalent in Standard. The bonding we undergo in childhood connects us in a way that is less than a marriage, but more than a betrothal.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what about Uhura?\u201d\n\u201cVulcan society evolves as any other would. During the last two centuries, it has slowly become acceptable for a bonded pair to pursue different partners, should they so desire, until the moment their \u2013 betrothal \u2013 is formalized and their bonding consummated. My relationship with Lieutenant Uhura developed spontaneously, but we were both aware of its transient nature. Lieutenant Uhura is well-versed in the aspects of Vulcan culture. She had also agreed with me that our professional relationship must take precedence which is why we had terminated our romantic involvement when I joined the Enterprise as your first officer.\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d Jim mutters, slightly overwhelmed. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m seeing a whole other side of you. Wait a minute, did you say you were no exception? As in you\u2019re not anymore? Did she die on Vulcan?\u201d\nSpock\u2019s face closes off some more. \u201cMany bonds were indeed destroyed by the destruction of my home planet, which is another reason I did not appreciate your levity in this matter. It had put all surviving Vulcans at risk until new bonds could be established. For that reason, our species remains in danger even though we are no longer under attack.\u201d\nAnd if Jim didn\u2019t feel bad enough before, he definitely feels like an asshole now.\n\u201cMy betrothed T\u2019Pring, however, survived the death of Vulcan,\u201d Spock says in a tone that is so tightly controlled that it\u2019s painful to hear. \u201cSome time ago, she had reached out to me and informed me that she no longer wished to become my wife. She asked the elders to dissolve our bond and they had approved it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\n\u201cShe cited my genetic makeup as her main reason. I am half-human, and it would be illogical to bond with me while Vulcans remain an endangered species. The elders accepted her logic.\u201d\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cWe have never been close, T\u2019Pring and I. During our formative years, I had been aware of her interest in another. When I learned that he, too, had survived the death of Vulcan, I knew to expect T\u2019Pring\u2019s call.\u201d\n\u201cSpock\u2026\u201d Jim has a bad feeling about this. \u201cWhen did she call exactly?\u201d\nSpock meets his eyes. \u201cTwo days before we assumed orbit around Veleri, Captain.\u201d\nJim closes his eyes. Fuck. He\u2019s an insensitive asshole, he\u2019s always been an insensitive asshole, but damn, his timing takes the cake on this one.\n\u201cI am so sorry.\u201d\nSpock makes an abortive gesture with his hand. \u201cYou did not know of this. It is my own inability to process the experience in a logical fashion that had let to my \u2013 dissatisfaction \u2013 with your actions. For that, I do apologize.\u201d\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t even.\u201d Jim shakes his head. \u201cYou had every reason in the universe to be pissed, Mr. Spock. I\u2019m sorry my timing sucks. And for what it\u2019s worth, I think your former fianc\u00e9e is an idiot.\u201d\nSpock lifts an eyebrow. \u201cI understand that the human tradition of friendship requires you to say that, but I assure you, it is unnecessary.\u201d\n\u201cOh, to hell with traditions.\u201d Jim rolls his eyes. \u201cDo you know why I put you on the spot like that? It wasn\u2019t because you were standing next to me. I could have dragged Uhura front and center or, hell, even Chekov, though that\u2019s disturbing in more ways than one. I picked you because I needed someone who would back me up without question even if they didn\u2019t get it or disagreed with me. I knew I could rely on you to be, well, you, no matter what. Anyone who\u2019s willing to give up that kind of loyalty from someone of your ability is, well, less than bright, shall we say. I don't know who that other guy is, but, unless she's marrying Surak, she's trading down.\u201d\nSpock contemplates this for a few moments. The silence lingers, and Jim is beginning to fear that he\u2019s been too open and has broken Spock with his emotionalism or something, when Spock says quietly, \u201cI am gratified to learn you feel that way, Captain.\u201d\n\u201cYou bet.\u201d Jim nods, relieved. The room feels almost too intense after all the revelations, and he casts around for a safer topic. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve played a game,\u201d he says, indicating the chess-set. \u201cFancy a match, Mr. Spock?\u201d\nSpock follows his gaze and stands up. \u201cPerhaps another night, Captain. I have taken enough of your time this evening.\u201d\nJim grins up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s yours for the taking, Mr. Spock. Have a good night.\u201d\nSpock nods at him solemnly and takes his leave.\n\u00a0\n--\n2.\nThe second time is not really Jim\u2019s fault. Well, at the very least, it\u2019s not his idea. It\u2019s just that the Diplomatic Corps had spent three months negotiating with the Aurelians to gain access to the ancient transmitter array that has been flooding the entire sector with mysterious transmissions, interfering with the normal operation of Starfleet communications, and Jim can\u2019t let all that careful work go to waste in less than thirty minutes, because as it turns out there are conditions to be met. The only ones allowed into the sacred cave should be of a certain age, physical strength, intellectual capability, social standing, and yes, marital status.\nThey pass all the preliminary tests easily enough (Spock almost looks bored solving the equations), but then the last condition is revealed, and Jim wants to swear. It\u2019s been three months since Veleri, but it\u2019s not like either of them has forgotten.\nThis time, though, Jim asks Spock\u2019s permission tacitly, before opening his big mouth. Technically, they don\u2019t have to be married to each other, but Jim needs to get inside the damn chamber and he sure as hell isn\u2019t going in without his science officer. This was the whole point of this exercise, after all. He looks at Spock, a question in his eyes. Spock looks none too happy, but gives Jim a subtle nod of assent. The Aurelians seem surprised at this development, but mercifully don\u2019t question it much.\nIt\u2019s worth it though.\n\u201cCaptain,\u201d Spock calls out, not looking up from his tricorder. He sounds enthusiastic enough for a Vulcan to indicate he\u2019s excited. \u201cThe obelisk will have to be quantum dated, but the runes on the outer structure are similar to those in the Iotian temple. If my estimation is correct, based on the language drift pattern, this device predates them by at least five thousand years.\u201d\n\u201cNo way.\u201d Kirk looks at the readings over his shoulder. \u201cDoes this mean I\u2019ll have to apologize to that dick Professor Daub for saying that the Seeders theory sucks?\u201d\n\u201cI would not jump to conclusions just yet, however, it is a significant discovery,\u201d Spock replies, engrossed in the data. \u201cAnd I believe the transmissions we have been intercepting indicate a malfunction in the energy grid.\u201d\n\u201cWhat energy grid?\u201d Jim asks, staring at five cubic meters of solid rock towering over them.\n\u201cThis one,\u201d Spock says as he reaches toward a specific rune and presses hard.\nThe entire structure of the monolith ripples and blinks out, revealing a complex network of holographic displays underneath.\nJim stares. \u201cWarn a guy before you do that, will you?\u201d\nSpock isn\u2019t listening, deftly flicking away the lit up strings of data in some unknown, but undoubtedly logical order, walking further inside the structure, eyes wide and yes, completely fascinated. \n\u201cThe signal\u2019s been interfering with our long-range communications,\u201d Jim calls after him. \u201cDon\u2019t forget what we\u2019re here for.\u201d\nSpock doesn\u2019t so much as acknowledge him, but then again, when he\u2019s in this mode, a full-scale Klingon attack wouldn\u2019t be enough to break him out of it. Jim grins to himself and leaves him to it.\nLater, when Spock manages to fix whatever\u2019s been out of whack in the ancient civilization\u2019s legacy \u2013 because apparently his hobbies include studying all available materials from five thousand years ago \u2013 and Jim half-bullies, half-coaxes him out of the chamber, they are greeted by rather excited-looking Aurelians.\n\u201cWe have prepared a commemorative feast for you,\u201d the head of the warrior priests announces, purple eyes shining with obvious pleasure, secondary wings flapping excitedly behind his back.\n\u201cThat is not necessary,\u201d Spock starts, probably impatient to get into his favorite lab and drown himself in the data he\u2019d gathered since Jim has evicted him from the source. \nJim steps on his foot none too subtly. \u201cA feast sounds great, High Priest,\u201d he replies, bowing. \u201cWe are honored.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Spock replies, only barely wincing as Jim presses down harder.\nJim almost feels bad for him when he sees piles upon piles of charred meat on the huge table, but Spock surveys it stoically and allows some to be placed on his plate, though he doesn\u2019t touch it. Jim surreptitiously eats it when no one is looking so as not to give offence. The wine is excellent, though, and Jim almost forgets that this is work, especially when the younger warriors start demonstration battles. \nHe feels happy and relaxed up until the High Priest announces: \u201cWe wish to bestow a token of our respect upon you in honor of your union.\u201d\nJim feels Spock go rigid next to him and thinks, \u2018Oh, fuck\u2019.\nIt\u2019s not so bad as it turns out. The Aurelians merely want Jim and Spock to walk away from this with a set of matching tattoos. Even the tattoos themselves aren\u2019t so bad, a simple band around their upper arms no more than a centimeter wide \u2013 fine, zero-point-nine centimeters \u2013 in an intricate pattern of vines and leaves. There\u2019s some cultural significance to the plant depicted, which Spock tries to explain, something about it having the strongest binding capabilities on the planet, ropes made of it being almost as endurable as steel, as well as some complicated mythology around it. Jim\u2019s eyes glaze a bit through that part, though the High Priest is looking more and more like he\u2019s falling desperately in love with Spock by the minute and is wondering if he could take Jim in some kind of one-on-one combat.\nIt\u2019s downright tasteful, is the point, and Jim for one is excited. Starfleet Uniform Code was clearly written by someone who hated joy in any shape or form, and when Jim had enlisted, they made him remove all his previous tats, since he couldn\u2019t prove that the words EASY RIDER stamped just below his navel held any cultural significance. They won\u2019t be able to make him get rid of this one, he thinks gleefully, since it\u2019s acquired in the line of duty.\nSpock for his part seems less than excited, and Jim sort of gets it when they remove his shirts. It\u2019s kind of a travesty to touch that skin with a needle or anything that could mar it, for that matter, and yeah, he should stop staring, but he\u2019s had a lot of wine, and it\u2019s not like Spock doesn\u2019t know him.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Jim whispers, leaning over from his own chair just before they\u2019re strapped in. \u201cBones can remove them no problem.\u201d\nSpock nods tightly and doesn\u2019t reply.\nJim\u2019s excitement sours somewhat when he sees them sterilize the needle over open fire. \u201cOh, shit,\u201d he mutters, and then his world goes red.\nWhen he knows anything beyond stabbing pain and gritted teeth \u2013 he vaguely remembers joking with the young warriors clustered around them throughout the whole thing, but he can\u2019t for the life of him recall a single word he\u2019d said \u2013 he\u2019s free from the chair and swaying on his feet next to the fire. His whole arm feels like it\u2019s burning from the inside, the thin bandage soaked with dried blood. Someone presses a flagon of wine into his hand, and Jim drinks greedily. \nSpock is on the other side of the fire, talking to a group of elderly women. The Wisdom Bearers, Jim remembers the title from the mission briefing. His first officer is still decidedly shirtless, the bandage on his right upper arm stained generously with green. Jim wonders dimly how they\u2019d gotten from point A to point B, but then a tight wave of pain makes him swallow a meowl and double over. He straightens up almost at once, but he\u2019s seeing white.\nWith the noise of the disintegrating celebration all around him, Spock couldn\u2019t possibly have heard him, but he turns around all the same, as though alerted by an internal radar. He\u2019s at Jim\u2019s side in an instant.\n\u201cCaptain, what is wrong?\u201d he asks urgently, pulling Jim close and holding him up by the elbow.\n\u201cI think,\u201d Jim manages through the panting, \u201cthere was something \u2013 in that ink \u2013 that I\u2019m \u2013 allergic to. Oh God,\u201d he groans, as another wave of pain nearly knocks him over. \u201cSpock, I think we need to cut this party short.\u201d\nSpock is on his communicator already, demanding at immediate beam-out, so Jim closes his eyes and leans into him, wondering why he can\u2019t just pass out like a normal human being and get away from the agony.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the ink,\u201d McCoy tells him an hour and a half later when he resurfaces in Medbay, the pain a distant echo. \u201cIt\u2019s all the wine you\u2019ve drunken down there, you moron. It contains xelovarvinol, which \u2013 surprise! \u2013 you\u2019re allergic to. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t have been so bad, if you hadn\u2019t had quite so much of it, but it\u2019s you we\u2019re talking about, so really, why bother.\u201d\n\u201cSpock?\u201d Jim demands, sitting up on the biobed and looking around with newfound alertness. \u201cIs he all right?\u201d\nMcCoy rolls his eyes. \u201cThe hobgoblin\u2019s fine, since like a sensible adult he didn\u2019t overindulge. He dumped your sorry ass here, had his arm treated and was gone, though not before half my nurses started a damn fanclub.\u201d\nJim sinks back onto the bed, grinning. \u201cI wondered why he didn\u2019t stick around.\u201d\nMcCoy snorts. \u201cHe wanted to, I think, but then one of them pulled out a holocam, thinking she\u2019s being subtle.\u201d\nJim laughs, shaking his head. \u201cThis means we\u2019re overdue for another round of that damn sensitivity training, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\nMcCoy shrugs. \u201cI already yelled at her, but yeah, might be a good idea. Will you attend this time, Captain?\u201d\n\u201cUm, my schedule\u2019s pretty tight.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you should find the time. Matching tattoos? Really, Jim?\u201d\n\u201cHey, it wasn\u2019t my fault! Or, you know, idea. Hey!\u201d He clutches at his right arm in sudden alarm. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nMcCoy rolls his eyes again. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s like I just met you and hadn\u2019t lived with you for three years listening to your whining that Starfleet made you get rid of your old ones. Though why anyone would tattoo a vomiting orangutan on their calf is beyond me.\u201d\n\u201cI was sixteen, it seemed funnier at the time. So you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI healed it, so you won\u2019t have to go through the shedding and scratching stage, that\u2019s all. Would have been better to leave it to heal naturally, but it\u2019s you we\u2019re talking about, so the chances of you not getting an infection are non-existent.\u201d\n\u201cHarsh, but probably true.\u201d Jim stares at a remarkably clean bandage thoughtfully. \u201cThanks, Bones. You\u2019re keeping me?\u201d\nMcCoy nods. \u201cOvernight, so don\u2019t try anything.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Jim mumbles, snuggling into the utterly un-snuggable biobed, feeling his eyes drift shut. It\u2019s been a long day, and he doesn\u2019t much care where to conk out. \u201cThanks.\u201d\nHe can hear the eyeroll this time and a soft mutter of, \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d\n--\nThe tattoo isn\u2019t mentioned much again, except when Pike calls in to talk about his mission report the next day and says, \u201cWell, at least it\u2019s not that \u2018how do you like \u2018em nuts?\u2019 tramp stamp again.\u201d\nJim narrows his eyes. \u201cDid you read McCoy\u2019s diary for fun or something?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I just have vivid memories of picking you up from the bar floor where you were drooling after having the shit kicked out of you. Very nearly left you there and then when I saw that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I think somewhere in that reference, there was definitely some sexual harassment, sir.\u201d\nPike actually smirks at him. \u201cYou weren\u2019t enlisted at the time, genius. But speaking of harassment, how\u2019s Spock? Not a fan of the body art, I take it?\u201d\n\u201cNah, he got rid of his the moment we beamed back. No sense of adventure.\u201d\n\u201cGood for him. And for the love of my sanity, would you stop dragging him into those hairbrained schemes of yours? Not that I don\u2019t enjoy watching Komack develop an aneurism every time he reads one of your reports, but I\u2019m the one who has to present them to the Federation Council Starfleet Oversight Committee, the Enterprise being the test case for long-ranged missions and all. And do you know who\u2019s the vice chairman of that committee, Kirk? Ambassador Sarek of Vulcan.\u201d\nJim stills. \u201cUm.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes. Every time I have to explain to him in detail how you had to fake-marry his son, he looks at me like he thinks going back to the time when Vulcans weren\u2019t pacifists might be a good idea.\u201d\n\u201cLook, first of all, Spock was onboard this time. And it\u2019s not my fault that every new space race we meet has a grudge against single people. Actually, as a single person, I\u2019m offended by that, but I don\u2019t go around telling alien cultures to mind their own business, I just do my damn job. Spock can damn well suck it up and deal. Er.\u201d He pauses. \u201cMaybe don\u2019t tell Sarek I said that.\u201d\n\u201cOh no, I\u2019ll quote you directly,\u201d Pike promises in a tone that suggests he would do exactly that, the asshole. \u201cUntil next time, Captain Kirk.\u201d\nThe truth is though that the tattoo is indeed tame enough to pass below the radar. No one onboard mentions it if they happen to catch a glimpse or even pay it any attention. It helps that, with McCoy\u2019s healing, it looks well-set and like it\u2019s always been there. Jim grins every time he catches sight of it in the shower, but it becomes absent-minded, habitual. He\u2019s actually surprised when Spock asks about it.\nIt\u2019s been three weeks since that particular mission, and they\u2019re sparring at the gym. Jim loves sparring with Spock. For one thing, Starfleet regulation workout clothes are too cold for him \u2013 and isn\u2019t that a thought as to how he survived at the Academy \u2013 so he wears the Vulcan version. It\u2019s black and it\u2019s the only vaguely calming thing about it. \nIt\u2019s hardly a secret that whoever designed Starfleet uniforms for all purposes, except perhaps for the EVA suits, believed that a healthy degree of sexual appreciation is good for the working environment. That person, however, had nothing on Vulcans. \nEither their uniforms \u2013 and clothes, for that matter \u2013 are designed to test each other\u2019s abilities for controlling basic urges or they\u2019re just above acknowledging any such thing. Jim\u2019s money is on the first theory, since the older a Vulcan gets, the less form-fitting his attire becomes. You can practically tell the decade of birth by the number of layers, just as their social standing can be divined by ones who know by the scale and length of the script embroidered somewhere near the collar. It\u2019s hard with those who wear official marks of office \u2013 that lettering gets brighter and bigger the more important the post. But clan markings are another story. The string of characters on Spock\u2019s clothes is miniscule and no more than three symbols in length, which pretty much says social strata: highest possible. \nYounger Vulcans are all about form-fitting and aesthetics, apparently. Jim had been onboard a Vulcan science vessel once during his Academy training. He spent most of his time there feeling half-terrified half-aroused and can sort of see why Vulcans en masse believe humans to be undisciplined, sex-obsessed savages. \nThat\u2019s not the main reason Jim loves working out with Spock, though. Spock always holds back. Jim had seen him running drills with security and teaching the basics of Suus Mahna to the science staff. He controls every motion so completely that for a natural fighter like Jim it\u2019s a bit painful to watch. He was the same way with Jim when they had first started sparring, and Jim had made it his mission to make him let go. \nIt worked on many levels. Faced with superior strength and speed, Jim had to become twice as unpredictable and creative, not to mention push himself harder than ever, in order to shake Spock loose, but eventually he\u2019d succeeded. It had taken a year for Spock to only start holding back as much as he would during a training match with a Vulcan. Jim counts that as a personal victory even if he has to go to Medbay immediately after more often than not. \nHe\u2019s definitely going today, he thinks, as Spock throws him to the mat and pins his arms above his head in a way that makes something go drastically out of place inside and Jim\u2019s vision whites out for a moment. When he blinks himself aware, Spock is looking to the point where Jim\u2019s t-shirt sleeve has ridden up, revealing the tattoo.\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d Spock says, not even slightly out of breath, because he\u2019s a dick like that. \u201cYou did not have it removed?\u201d\n\u201cNah.\u201d Jim grins. \u201cThey were a warrior culture and they accepted me as one of their own. That\u2019s like every Earth boy\u2019s childhood dream coming true, Spock. I wanted to keep the memento, since Starfleet definitely can\u2019t make me get rid of this one.\u201d\nSpock gives him a curious look and lets him up, stepping back. Jim lingers, not certain his arms are even attached to his body anymore. There\u2019s also a not so good sensation coming from his ribs. Not wanting to admit he might need help, he stalls by glancing up Spock\u2019s arms, covered to the wrists, of course. \n\u201cBet Vulcans think body art is illogical.\u201d\n\u201cNot illogical,\u201d Spock replies in a tone of mild exasperation as he comes to help Jim sit up anyway. \u201cMerely archaic.\u201d\n\u201cA personal choice then. Well, I guess you didn\u2019t feel like being even more of an oddity to your peers.\u201d\nSpock\u2019s face shutters instantly as he pulls back. For a moment, he looks as though he\u2019s considering saying something, but then his expression smoothens out once more.\n\u201cNo matter our current stage of development, Vulcans are a warrior race,\u201d he says after a beat in his detached professor mode. \u201cI do not need to be reminded of this by means of a souvenir.\u201d\nJim nods a little sadly. \u201cNo, I suppose, you don\u2019t.\u201d He flashes Spock a grin, extending a hand. The motion makes him wince. \u201cOw. Care to escort me to Medbay, Mr. Spock? I feel like you\u2019ve dismantled me piece by piece, only fair you\u2019ll help put me back together.\u201d\nSpock acquiesces, but his eyes are distant, his touch clinical. Jim wonders if it\u2019s him and his big mouth or something else entirely \u2013 there\u2019s no telling with Spock, ever \u2013 but then Bones is yelling at him for being a clumsy oaf, which, unfair, and it goes straight out of his mind.\n\u00a0\n--\n3. \nJim doesn\u2019t know the next time is the next time until he\u2019s neck-deep in it. Although how he didn\u2019t suspect something the moment Pike\u2019s face appeared on the viewscreen in the middle of Alpha shift, he couldn\u2019t say.\nApparently, something fishy is going on with a few Federation colonies in the Barradus Belt: important equipment suddenly malfunctions or is misplaced, shipments of precious cargo are mistakenly redirected and then lost, personnel are rotated unexpectedly with some key specialists being inexplicably dismissed. Any one of those would have been disregarded as an aberration or common mishaps that happen in all not-so-long-ago established colonies, but the sheer concentration of them within the past six months raised a red flag. The colonies officials are being cagey in their reports, and it\u2019s clear that something\u2019s going on there, but nobody\u2019s talking. \nStarfleet feels that showing up at Barradus in force would only send them further into hiding. Instead, two officers would be sent there incognito to figure out what the hell\u2019s going on there on the ground. It is just a matter of a happy coincidence then that the Enterprise happens to be the closest ship, and its captain has an up-to-this-point questionable but now suddenly incredibly convenient experience dealing with shady characters of all sorts. \n\u201cYou\u2019re not going alone,\u201d Pike tells him, when Jim\u2019s shit-eating grin threatens to split his face.\nHe doesn\u2019t say it with any particular inflection, but it brings Jim up short. He swivels back in his chair. \u201cUhura! Bet you\u2019re dying to lend your sensitive ear to some backwater dialects?\u201d\n\u201cNot so much,\u201d she replies, the corner of her mouth twitching. \u201cI have you right here, don\u2019t I?\u201d\nShe\u2019s so fired, Jim thinks, and jumps out of his chair to grin maniacally at his navigator. \u201cChekov! You\u2019re dying to go undercover, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cWell, sir, actually\u2014\u201d\n\u201cRight, you look like you\u2019re twelve anyway. Sulu! Sulu, time to be badass again. I\u2019ll let you bring your sword along and everything. Actually, come to think of it, maybe don\u2019t, I still remember that bar on Vega III, and if you\u2019re going to be banned from any more systems, we might as well plot a course for the Beta Quadrant right now. So yeah, just leave the sword, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSpock,\u201d Pike calls over Kirk\u2019s head.\nSpock, the traitor, is already stepping down from his station. \u201cAdmiral?\u201d\n\u201cDo you know any secret Vulcan techniques to stop verbal diarrhea in humans without knocking them out so they could still listen?\u201d\nSpock looks like this is a new and exciting possibility he hasn\u2019t considered before. \u201cUnfortunately, no, but I shall investigate.\u201d\n\u201cPlease do. Kirk, stop with the headless chicken act and focus. It\u2019s a two-man job and you\u2019re going with Spock. No, I don\u2019t want to hear it. I\u2019m sending all the pertinent information to your comm spec, and we\u2019re giving you a ride. You\u2019ll rendezvous with the Kurosawa in six hours, they\u2019ll have it ready for you. You should be ready to depart by then. Instruct Mr. Scott to proceed to Deep Space Three for that impulse engine upgrade he\u2019s been bugging you about. He\u2019s got approval.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be happy to hear that,\u201d Jim says, resigned.\n\u201cMission brief received, Captain,\u201d Uhura calls out from behind.\n\u201cThank you, Lieutenant.\u201d\n\u201cKirk, Spock.\u201d Pike leans forward, all traces of mirth erased. \u201cWhatever\u2019s going on there, we need to know, and that only happens if you report back. Understood?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d they reply in unison.\n\u201cGood. I\u2019m counting on you. Pike out.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Mr. Spock.\u201d Jim turns to look at him. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re with me.\u201d\nSpock doesn\u2019t reply just then, barring a slight nod of acknowledgement. But when the turbolift doors shut behind them, he turns to face Jim.\n\u201cCaptain, if you truly hold reservations about me accompanying you on this mission, I am certain you need only make them clear to Admiral Pike. If my performance has been in any way unsatisfactory\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh my God, shut up.\u201d Jim presses his fingers to the bridge of his nose. \u201cIf your performance is suddenly short of exemplary, ever, it means the apocalypse can\u2019t be far behind.\u201d\nSpock digests this. For once, he doesn\u2019t question the illogical means of expression. Instead, he says quietly, \u201cThen it is my company that you find objectionable.\u201d\nJim drops his hand to stare at him. \u201cNo,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cNever. It\u2019s just\u201d \u2013 he looks away, trying to articulate \u2013\u201cthere\u2019s something about this mission. I have a \u2013 a feeling or something. Completely illogical, I know.\u201d He smiles as he catches sight of Spock\u2019s expression. \u201cI\u2019ll try to rein it in for the duration, I promise.\u201d\n\u201cI shall be delighted, Captain.\u201d\nStarfleet has gone as far as to create actual undercover identities for them. Jim turns into one Merlin Monroe \u2013 the ID makes him scowl and vow retribution on Pike and his clearly juvenile sense of humor \u2013 officially a dealer in kevas and trillium, and unofficially a mercenary picking up odd jobs as he goes along, not always on the right side of legal, but in no serious trouble with the law. He grins as it gives him a perfect excuse to dig out his jeans and leather jacket. Seeing his own reflection is strange, he feels oddly disconnected, crawling back into the skin he had shed some time ago. But it still fits, and the mannerisms come back of their own volition, like a build-in accessory.\nSpock becomes Selek, a Vulcan astronavigator and computer tech who had left Vulcan a long time ago because of some \u2018irreconcilable differences\u2019 with his family and thus had survived Nero\u2019s attack. Monroe apparently hires him for a specific job a while back and then decides to keep as a partner.\nWhen Spock walks into the transporter room, Jim feels a little dizzy. He\u2019s wearing civvies as well in muted dark colors \u2013 charcoal grey pants and \u2013 what the hell? ankle boots? \u2013 dark blue tunic, and dark brown jacket made of some sort of eco-leather, of course, never the real thing for Spock, even though it\u2019s all replicated these days. Even his hair is purposefully mussed, giving him a windswept, slightly rebellious look. He looks like he just rolled out of the backroom of some very classy yet very wanton nightclub. He meets Jim\u2019s eyes and lifts an eyebrow in silent inquiry.\nJim swallows. \u201cLooking good, Mr. Spock,\u201d he says, looking anywhere but at him. \u201cVery convincing.\u201d\nThis. This is exactly why he didn\u2019t want Spock on this mission. Or rather this is how it starts, because Jim\u2019s sure with his luck there\u2019s worse to come.\nFor a while, though, it goes on without a hitch. There is a small space station in the middle of the Barradus system that serves as a neutral territory, a hub for trade negotiations, a space dock, and a meeting point. Spock logically suggests they start their investigation there, and Jim agrees. Once docked, Spock ostensibly goes in search for supplies and Jim hits the bar scene, talking loudly about his supposed exploits in uncharted space. He hits on the patrons five times, is hit on by the patrons eleven times, gets into a bar fight twice, and is thrown out once before the point gets across and his reputation is established.\nWhen contact finally happens though, it\u2019s not him they approach, but Spock, who\u2019s been quietly collecting information in the background (hauls Jim back to the ship after a night of well-staged debauchery four times, administers hyposprays five times, uses the dermal regenerator McCoy had left because \u2018I know you, Jim, goddammit\u2019 once). \n\u201cWe have a meeting tonight,\u201d Spock informs him, and Jim sags in relief. \n\u201cThank God. I don\u2019t think I could have kept this up much longer.\u201d\n\u201cYou appeared to be quite in your element. I was impressed.\u201d\nJim gives him the evil eye. \u201cShut up.\u201d He knows he will change his mind at some point, but right now he feels that if he never sees another glass of Saurian brandy again it\u2019ll be too soon. \nBy that point, with everything they\u2019ve learnt, Jim sort of expects to see someone from the colonies\u2019 administration. What he doesn\u2019t expect is to see all of them \u2013 two governors, three administrators, and one reverend from all the affected worlds \u2013 to gather in an abandoned cargo bay. Judging by Spock\u2019s utter lack of expression, he\u2019s as stunned as Jim is.\nIt turns out to be simultaneously simpler and more complicated than Jim thought. Every discrepancy Starfleet had noticed was due to the fact that the leaders of the colonies weren\u2019t very clever about covering up the fact that they\u2019ve been redirecting certain valuable equipment and cargo to the Orion Syndicate. Every colony leader present has a member of their family kidnapped and held hostage, and their continuous survival depends solely on the obedience of their powerful relations. \n\u201cThat\u2019s fucked up,\u201d Jim says, once it\u2019s all out there in the open. \u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d\n\u201cFor the past six months,\u201d Administrator Voronin admits reluctantly. \u201cYou have to understand. We didn\u2019t want to do this, but our hands are tied.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you not contact Starfleet?\u201d Spock asks. \u201cSurely, they would have agreed to intervene\u2014\u201d\nThe leaders exchange grim looks. \n\u201cWe did, the first time around,\u201d Governor Pani says. \u201cAbout a year ago when my granddaughter was kidnapped. I called Starfleet immediately, and they came. They rescued Laura, and for a while we thought that was the end of it. But then two months later, there was a \u2013 a malfunction in the atmospheric controls in her room.\u201d His voice breaks audibly. \u201cShe suffocated. It was ruled an accident, but a man came to see me directly after. He said, \u2018That\u2019s what happens when you call in the Feds\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cOuch,\u201d Jim says, because his assumed persona is vapid and completely devoid of tact, and it takes an effort not to glance at Spock. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not that big a fan of Starfleet myself, obviously,\u201d he says, letting his sarcasm show, \u201cbut they at least have really big guns. Not that we\u2019re not flattered you came to us, but this is a really small operation. All I have is an old cargo ship. What makes you think I can do anything if the Feds can\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of force,\u201d Pani bristles. \u201cWe have the muscle. We combined our security teams into a special task force, and we have ships.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but to take on the Orion Syndicate\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOrion is pretty far from here, Mr. Monroe,\u201d Administrator Kiara interjects. \u201cAnd we happen to know that their operations are autonomous. If we eliminate this \u2013 branch, I suppose, is the word, that\u2019ll be the end of it.\u201d\n\u201cThen again, what do you need us for?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know where they\u2019re keeping the hostages,\u201d Pani explains. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t send anyone in to find out. They won\u2019t let the women near, and the men \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of the Orion females and their pheromones. It\u2019s no exaggeration, Monroe, let me tell you. Men go completely stupid, will tell them anything, do anything. We can\u2019t risk it. If we tip them off, our families are as good as dead.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, we\u2019d never turn to a mercenary,\u201d Kiara says frankly, looking at him with a distinctly unimpressed expression, \u201cif you didn\u2019t have a Vulcan for a partner.\u201d\nJim stills. It must be premonition or something, but at that moment he already knows that when she says \u2018partner\u2019 she means anything but the professional.\nHer counterpart from another colony whispers something to her, and Kiara nods. \u201cForgive me, I\u2019m not well-versed in the terminology. I meant bondmate.\u201d\nJim does chance a look at Spock then. Spock seems utterly inscrutable, but he\u2019s studying the elderly woman with dangerous intensity. \nThey\u2019ve been paying attention all right, Jim thinks ruefully. But not to his spectacles in the bar. He hit on people, but he never left with them. He left half draped over Spock, because even anti-intoxication hypos will only get one so far, and they had to fit a certain profile. And on the nights he left alone, he excused himself on the grounds that his partner was waiting for him. Jim nearly groans realizing abruptly that it was his doing and that Spock is going to kill him when he figures it out.\n\u201cOh, who cares what it\u2019s called,\u201d Pani dismisses impatiently. \u201cPoint is, Vulcans are immune to Orion pheromones, and through your lover \u2013 partner, whatever, you\u2019re immune as well. You can get close to them and pretend to be affected. All we need is the location.\u201d\nIt\u2019s actually not a bad plan, Jim has to admit with chagrin. He remembers his Xenobiology 101, and the colony leader is right on both accounts. If Jim really was married to Spock for once, instead of somehow stumbling into the role-playing yet again, they could have pulled it off. As it is\u2026 Is Spock asleep over there, Jim wonders. If ever there was a time to come up with a bit of bullshit Vulcan lore that would explain why it won\u2019t work, it would be now.\n\u201cAnd then what?\u201d Jim asks, temporizing. \u201cYour task force goes in, guns blazing? Have much experience extracting hostages without getting them killed, do they?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d Kiara shakes her head. \u201cBut that seems to be your specialty, Mr. Monroe, if what we heard about you is right.\u201d\n\u201cLook, lady,\u201d Jim starts, having no idea where he\u2019s going. \u201cI won my fair share of cat-and-mouse games, I\u2019ll grant you that. But going against the Orion Syndicate\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe would pay anything,\u201d Voronin steps in, thinking Jim is just haggling over price. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a warp-grade dilithium crystal for every hair on my niece\u2019s head.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 very generous,\u201d Jim says, floundering, \u201cI\u2019m just not sure\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe accept,\u201d Spock says calmly.\nIt\u2019s so unexpected that Jim nearly gives himself whiplash turning to stare at him. \u201cWe do?\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Spock confirms, eyes on the colonists. \u201cOn the condition that your task force will be placed under our command.\u201d\n\u201cYou have it, Mr. Selek,\u201d Voronin says instantly, and the others nod. \u201cWe\u2019re risking much here, trusting you. But we\u2019re desperate.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to confer with my partner now,\u201d Spock says as though commenting on the weather. \u201cWe will contact you shortly to discuss the details. If you will excuse us.\u201d\nThe moment they step out into the corridor, Jim grabs his shoulder. \u201cAre you out of your Vulcan mind? We can\u2019t possibly\u2014\u201d\nSpock shrugs off his touch easily. \u201cNot here,\u201d is all he says.\nHe\u2019s right, but it still leaves Jim fuming. He barely contains himself until they reach the sanctuary of their ship. Spock makes him wait until he runs a complete security check and only then looks at him. \n\u201cI apologize for interrupting you, Captain, but I believe you were about to refuse them, and I could not allow that to happen. True, they have not acted through proper channels, but their logic is understandable if flawed. We cannot let the situation continue.\u201d\n\u201cI agree, but we can\u2019t do it the way they want us to, Spock,\u201d Jim snaps, utterly disgruntled. \u201cIn case it skipped your attention, we\u2019re not really bonded, which means I\u2019m not immune, which means, newsflash: we can\u2019t do it!\u201d\n\u201cI believe there is a way,\u201d Spock says calmly. \u201cI would not have accepted the deal if I did not have a solution in mind, Captain.\u201d The reproachful \u2018You should know me better than that\u2019 remains unspoken. \n \u201cFair enough.\u201d Jim narrows his eyes at him. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d\nSpock almost looks \u2013 uncomfortable. \u201cIt is \u2013 somewhat irregular,\u201d he admits. \u201cPerhaps I did speak too rashly. But if you trust me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSpock,\u201d Jim interrupts. \u201cIn all the time that we\u2019ve known each other, when have I ever so much as hinted that I don\u2019t trust you?\u201d\n\u201cThe solution I propose requires a somewhat deeper degree of trust as it is of a rather personal nature.\u201d Spock definitely looks shifty now.\nJim has an epiphany. \u201cIt\u2019s a mind-meld, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cAs part of it, yes. If you will allow this, I can create a shallow link between our minds.\u201d\n\u201cLike a bond?\u201d\n\u201cNo, nothing at all like a bond. This link would be superficial. It will not allow us access to each other\u2019s deeper thoughts and memories.\u201d\n\u201cWait, if it\u2019s that shallow, will it be able to shield me from the effect of the pheromones?\u201d\n\u201cOrdinarily, it wouldn\u2019t. However, I have noted a higher than average affinity existing between our minds. I am convinced that this link would indeed prove sufficient to protect you from any undue influence.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that we have this \u2018higher than average affinity\u2019?\u201d\nSpock\u2019s lips twitch. \u201cFor now, it is sufficient that I do know. I believe you stated that you trust me?\u201d\n\u201cLow blow,\u201d Jim mutters. Spock merely lifts an eyebrow and looks perfectly content to say nothing at all in the foreseeable future. Jim rolls his eyes. \u201cFine. If you\u2019re certain it\u2019ll work, let\u2019s do this. But if my crazy brain screws up with your synapses or something, remember that this was your idea.\u201d\nEither it\u2019s Jim\u2019s imagination, or Spock really does sigh softly. \u201cI am unlikely to forget.\u201d\nThey come to face each other, and Jim feels a moment of trepidation. But Spock\u2019s touch is confident yet not forcefull, his breath a soothing gust against Jim\u2019s skin, as he says the ritual words, \u201cMy mind to your mind, my thoughts to your thoughts.\u201d\nFor a moment, Jim feels nothing. Then, all of a sudden he\u2019s not alone. It\u2019s nothing concrete, no thoughts, no feelings, just a presence. He feels like his skull is too tight, it\u2019s too crowded in there, but before he can panic, the pressure eases and withdraws. Suddenly it feels too empty, as though additional space has been created and there\u2019s not enough of Jim to fill it all. He\u2019s alone, except there\u2019s a small \u2013 spark? It\u2019s an odd sensation, like a split lip. If he worries it with his tongue, he can feel it, but if he doesn\u2019t it\u2019s like it\u2019s not really there.\nJim opens his eyes to find Spock standing at least two meters away from him, watching. \u201cIt\u2019s done then?\u201d Jim asks, bewildered.\n\u201cAffirmative.\u201d\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t feel anything,\u201d he says, pressing on the bundle of something inside just to make sure. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t feel any different. At all. Are you sure this is enough to make me immune to Orion females?\u201d\nSpock looks distinctly uninterested in Jim\u2019s panic attack and abandons him in favor of activating his terminal. \n\u201cI do not believe there is anything in the known universe that would make you immune to females, Orion or otherwise,\u201d he says in his driest tone. \u201cBut yes, Captain, insofar as their pheromones are concerned, I am reasonably sure.\u201d\nJim huffs in indignation, but as invitations to stop fretting go, this one is pretty straightforward, so he leaves it be and hopes Spock isn\u2019t being an arrogant bastard and actually knows what he\u2019s talking about.\nAs it turns out, he does. \nThe bar that the Orion crew frequents \u2013 and Jim can\u2019t decide if he loves it or hates it that the better part of this mission is conducted in a drinking hole of some sort \u2013 only lets him in on sufferance, but a foot in the door is all Jim needs anyway. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s unfamiliar with Orion women. But Gaila was taking pheromone suppressants as part of her oath to Starfleet and was, in fact, trying to behave herself. The three ladies that zero in on him as he enters have no such compunctions.\nThey laugh, and drink, and talk with their hands and bodies as well as their mouths, and it\u2019s an interesting sensation to be able to appreciate their sensuous, overwhelming and raw sexuality without being, well, overwhelmed by it. Jim only realizes he should long have been acting mad with lust when they start exchanging puzzled looks over his head. Acting like he\u2019s drugged on them isn\u2019t a hardship, but inwardly he can\u2019t help but crow in delight.\nIt goes as planned in that they tag-team him to their ship. Then it promptly goes to hell when they knock him out cold as the ship goes to warp. \n\u201cLock him up with the others,\u201d is the first thing Jim hears as he comes to, swallowing curses as a splitting headache hits. It recedes almost instantly though and he blinks, surprised, but continues to act groggy. \n\u201cToo bad,\u201d one of the females tells him as she lifts up Jim\u2019s face. He gives her a stupid grin. \u201cThis could have been fun, handsome.\u201d\nTwo security guards hold him up \u2013 and why do Orion males have to be so tall and bulky, Jim thinks resentfully \u2013 as he\u2019s beamed down to the surface\u2026 of what? Jim squints at the orange sun, setting low at the horizon. He\u2019s still in the Barradus Belt then, definitely, but which planet? He twists his head, groaning, in a would-be attempt to alleviate the pain in his neck and takes stock. Two moons, one decidedly closer than the other. His mind automatically calculates the angles in relation to the sun, and Jim grits his teeth, wishing he could transmit the information to Spock somehow. \nIt gets even worse when they drag him inside what looks like an abandoned mine, transformed into an honest to God pirates\u2019 bay. The lower layer had been converted into a prison block \u2013 or perhaps animal stalls would be a better descriptor. From his cell, Jim can see at least half the others quite clearly, and he\u2019s pretty certain that the bunch of frightened women and kids are the very hostages he\u2019s been looking for. \nFrom what he could see while being rudely dragged through the entire facility, it hardly has half a dozen guards on duty. It makes sense, since the main advantage is the secrecy of the location. It\u2019s not, he thinks ruefully, that he\u2019s failed to gain access to that information, since technically he\u2019s right on top of it. That he can\u2019t do anything about it or report is another matter. Maybe if one of the women came for him or a guard brought him food, he could\u2026 He\u2019ll have to wait and see.\nThat the wait only lasts two hours is strange, but what happens next is definitely stranger. The lights go out and the door of the cell swings open. Jim stares. Correction, all the cell doors are open, if the rising wave of confused voices is any indication. An energy blackout is the best way to initiate a computer override\u2026\nJim springs to his feet and pitches his voice to carry. \u201cEveryone, this is a rescue operation. Kindly come out of your cells, gather behind me, and keep quiet.\u201d\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d a young woman asks, frowning, half-hopeful, half-wary as she steps out into the corridor in the low glow of emergency lights.\nThere\u2019s a definite family resemblance there, and Jim smiles at her. \u201cMs. Kiara junior, I presume? Your grandmother sends her regards. Now come out of there and get these people in order.\u201d\nThe guards meet them in the outer corridor, screaming and frantic, aiming to intimidate apparently more than physically subdue. There\u2019re only two of them, armed with hand weapons, and Jim hasn\u2019t been training with Spock all this time for the hell of it. He\u2019s way too fast for them, especially charged on adrenaline, and has them groaning on the floor before any of the kids can get a good look. Although, judging by the way a small girl kicks one in the shin as she passes, he needn\u2019t have worried.\nThey spill into the main chamber on the upper level to find another guard howling in pain, apparently electrocuted by a short-circuit in a console. That one has a disruptor on his belt, which Jim immediately grabs and fires, keeping himself firmly between the remaining guards and the hostages. \nHe needs to get them out in the open and in a tight group. Where the instructions have come from, he doesn\u2019t know, but there\u2019s no hesitation in him. \n\u201cCome on, come on, come on!\u201d he yells, motioning them out one by one, as he keeps the Orions occupied. \u201cGet out there and stay together! Keep your heads down!\u201d\nNow would be an incredibly good time, Jim thinks, as the last hostage, a teenage boy, runs past him, covering his head with his arms. Jim aims his disruptor upward and fires at the ceiling, making the rock explode over the guards\u2019 heads. Horrified screams are cut short almost instantly by the sound of the massive cave-in. Jim barely avoids being hit as he runs out, thinking, Now, now, now.\nThe transporter beam catches him just as he reaches the hostages and a moment later Jim is looking at the familiar surroundings of the cargo ship and Spock operating the controls.\nJim beams at him. \u201cHow on Earth did you find me?\u201d\n\u201cLater.\u201d Spock shakes his head, looking grim. \u201cIs everyone accounted for?\u201d\nJim glances back over his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s everyone they were holding down there. Spock, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cThe Orion ship that had delivered you here is on its way back as we speak,\u201d Spock reports. \u201cI have informed the task force of our location. However, if we do not make it to the rendezvous coordinates in time\u2014\u201d\nJim nods, his elation fading. Starfleet upgraded the sensors and computer systems on the cargo ship, but not the weapons.\n\u201cGo,\u201d he tells Spock. \u201cI\u2019ll get these guys settled and join you on the bridge shortly.\u201d\nFor a thirty-something blissful minutes it looks like they\u2019re going to make it. Then, the Orions are upon them. \n\u201cSpock, give me helm control and take over weapons!\u201d Jim yells over the sound of the ship being hit by disruptor fire. \u201cAlso hold on!\u201d\nThey dodge and shoot, and dodge and shoot again. Jim\u2019s pretty sure his Academy piloting instructors would have grounded him for good if they saw the way he\u2019s handling the puny cargo ship, but he thinks Sulu might have liked it. He doesn\u2019t have the time to transmit the target coordinates to Spock as he goes, but somehow Spock hits them unerringly anyway, which is the only reason they\u2019re still alive if severely banged up when the task force shows up. \nIt\u2019s somehow less satisfying than he thought it would be to see the Syndicate ship turn into a sun-like fireball. Then, Jim remembers the kids in the cargo hold, the heavily pregnant girl of no more than twenty, and the elderly man who could barely stand straight, and yeah, it\u2019s satisfying enough.\n\u201cThank you for your assistance, Mr. Monroe,\u201d the task force commander says tersely over the viewscreen after they finish beaming over the hostages. \u201cWe\u2019ll tractor your ship back to the Barradus station where you can get your payment in full.\u201d\n\u201cSplendid.\u201d Jim salutes him and cuts the connection off. There\u2019s little to do now but relax and enjoy the ride, and he turns to Spock, grinning softly. \u201cHacking alien security systems via a remote link from orbit, Mr. Spock? I don\u2019t remember that particular course being offered at the Academy.\u201d\n\u201cIs it not sufficient that I have been successful?\u201d Spock asks, clearly not willing to be engaged, as he locks down his station and stands up. \u201cIf you would come to Medbay with me, I will see to your injuries.\u201d\nJim tries to read him, but gets nothing. He frowns. \u201cFine.\u201d\nHe suffers himself to be treated for his cuts and bruises mostly, all the while trying to catch Spock\u2019s eye, but it\u2019s futile. Spock is acting like an extremely good-looking if somewhat passive-aggressive AI.\n\u201cSpock.\u201d Jim rests a hand on his arm. Spock stills. Jim studies him. \u201cYou never did explain how you were able to find me. It was the link, wasn\u2019t it? That\u2019s the only explanation. I thought it wasn\u2019t supposed to be that deep?\u201d\nSpock almost sighs as he pulls away from Jim\u2019s touch, but his frame actually softens. \u201cIt was not deep. It was as I told you, a superficial connection only. However, it appears I have underestimated the degree of affinity between our minds,\u201d he admits. If Jim didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d bet his captain\u2019s stripes that Spock sounds rueful.\n\u201cThe evidence suggests that when you directed a particular thought at me, I was able to receive the information,\u201d Spock explains. \u201cFor instance, when you were beamed down to the planet, you noted the moons and the relative position of the sun. I \u2013 heard it, for lack of a better term. From this data, it was possible to calculate which planetoid you were in fact located on.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Jim studies his face, still desperate to get Spock to meet his eyes. \u201cWhy is this making you upset? Because you are upset, link or no link, I can tell.\u201d\nSpock turns away from him, a full retreat. \u201cI was careless,\u201d he says at long last. \u201cThere are strict rules regarding mental contact among my people. I have always accepted them but never understood. I do now.\u201d\n\u201cSpock.\u201d Jim slides off the biobed, resting a hand on Spock\u2019s shoulder. \u201cJust remove the damn thing if it bothers you that much. I mean, I\u2019d love nothing better than to keep it, but\u2014\u201d\nHe\u2019d said the magic words, apparently, because suddenly he has Spock\u2019s complete attention.\n\u201cYou would prefer to keep it?\u201d Spock asks, almost openly incredulous. The intensity of his gaze is unnerving.\n\u201cWell.\u201d Jim shrugs, wondering what the hell he\u2019d wandered into now. \u201cYou can\u2019t deny that it has come in handy. You were able to find me. We could apparently trade important information back and forth. It was you who told me to get everyone out in the open, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYou were able to perceive that?\u201d Spock\u2019s eyebrows crawl up to his hairline. \u201cI did think it would be preferable for the transporter, but I did not believe you would be able to hear\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWell, I did,\u201d Jim says. \u201cAnd then when the Orions caught us, you can\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t feel that. We were moving and firing as one; I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the only thing that saved us. So yeah, I can think of so many away missions where this would have been a life-saver. I\u2019m a captain, I always look for ways to make my crew more efficient.\u201d He grins at Spock.\nSpock stares at him a moment longer, then nods and looks away. \u201cOf course, Captain. It is only logical.\u201d\n\u201cSo what do you say?\u201d Jim squeezes his shoulder gently. \u201cMaybe better to leave it be?\u201d\nSpock moves from under his touch with an almost apologetic subtlety. \u201cI am afraid it would not be wise. Had everything been as you describe, it would have been unorthodox, but perhaps acceptable. However, the point remains that this very simple connection has not behaved as it was designed to. The probability is high, therefore, that should we leave it in place, it would develop spontaneously into a connection of a different nature, one that would require the services of a mind healer to dissolve.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s bad,\u201d Jim says, finally beginning to see. \u201cBecause he\u2019d tell others, and a link like that isn\u2019t something Vulcans do lightly.\u201d\nSpock meets his eyes. \u201cYou are mistaken, Captain. Apart from bonded pairs or family members, Vulcans do not do this at all.\u201d\nJim stares, robbed of breath all of a sudden. \u201cI want to say that you shouldn\u2019t have to compromise who you are to this extent for the sake of the mission. But I can\u2019t argue with the results.\u201d\n\u201cNor I,\u201d Spock says. \u201cYou do see why we cannot keep it, however?\u201d\n\u201cI guess.\u201d Jim nods. \u201cYou want to do this now?\u201d\n\u201cThe longer it remains in effect\u2014\u201d\n\u201cRight. Go ahead, Mr. Spock. Do it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s strange when Spock touches his face this time. Too comforting, almost too personal for something so technical. Jim feels a sense of sweet vertigo, as though something wonderful is spinning in front of him just out of reach, and if he could only catch it for a moment\u2014\n\nJim. You are resisting. Please desist.\n\nEmbarrassment overwhelms him. He doesn\u2019t want to let the link go, like a child holding on to a favorite toy that someone is trying to take away, and it translates as resistance on the mental plain. \nSorry, he sends back clumsily. I\u2019ll stop.\nSpock doesn\u2019t respond except with a feeling, a soft touch of acceptance and understanding, a dismissal of guilt.\nJim stops struggling to hold on now that he\u2019s aware he\u2019s doing it, and a moment later he blinks his eyes open, alone in his own head. He feels small somehow, like he was holding a world in his grasp and now he\u2019s just a pin on the map, a tiny, entirely separate being.\nSpock is still standing close, his hands cradling Jim\u2019s face in a way that has no logical excuse for it that Jim can think of, eyes searching. \n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Jim says hoarsely, pushing back, because another moment, and Spock would really have reasons to bring him up on charges. \u201cIt\u2019s done then?\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Spock says, stepping back as well. \u201cI must begin working on my report to Starfleet, Captain. If you will excuse me.\u201d\n--\nStarfleet, however, is waiting for them at Barradus station, which Jim suspects is also Spock\u2019s doing, in the form of one Captain Moreno of the Columbia. She\u2019s a tiny woman in her late forties, with a mischievous smile and penetrating eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019m giving you a lift back to Deep Space Three, Captain Kirk,\u201d she says cheerily as they meet her on her bridge. \u201cStarfleet is taking over here.\u201d\n\u201cBut \u2013 we haven\u2019t been paid yet,\u201d Jim protests, grinning.\nMoreno laughs. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to Voronin and told him we have you in custody for some previous transgression. He pleaded your case rather passionately, you know.\u201d Her look turns sly. \u201cSaid something about how if you got a Vulcan to bond with you, you can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d She looks them over speculatively, eyes filled with humor. \u201cForgive me, Captain, Commander. I didn\u2019t realize congratulations were in order.\u201d\nSpock declines to dignify that with a response, but his eyes turn upward for a glorious moment, as though he\u2019s praying for strength. \nJim sputters. \u201cThey\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re not married! Voronin and the rest of them \u2013 they came up with that all by themselves!\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet, the pheromones really had no effect on you, Captain,\u201d Moreno drawls thoughtfully, clearly laughing at him. \u201cI look forward to reading your mission report. That\u2019s got to be something else.\u201d\nFor a moment, Jim is sorely tempted to tell her to mind her own damn business, but she does have seniority over him and anyway, he\u2019s grown as a person. He treats her to his most charming smile. \u201cWhy wait? Have dinner with me and I\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d\n\u201cCaptain,\u201d Spock cuts in in his trademark Vulcan-bored voice. He adds in Moreno\u2019s direction, a touch more respectfully, \u201cCaptain. As delighted as I am that both of you are enjoying yourselves, I do not believe I am needed here at the moment. May I therefore be excused? I find myself in dire need of a sonic shower.\u201d\nMoreno nods at him, smiling sweetly. \u201cYou\u2019re our guest, Commander, please do as you like. Though I have to warn you, my science officer might be lying in ambush out there somewhere waiting for you. If you don\u2019t want to have your ear talked off about some article of yours or something, better be careful.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d Spock inclines his head in a reserved salute. \u201cI appreciate the warning.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t so much as look at Jim as he leaves. \n\u201cHm,\u201d Moreno hums thoughtfully, looking after him. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not married, Kirk? Something tells me you have a lot of groveling ahead of you.\u201d\nJim presses his fingers to the bridge of his nose. \u201cTell me about it.\u201d\nPike doesn\u2019t waste time yelling at him over subspace this time. Instead, Jim gets a single-line message in his mailbox.\n\nIt\u2019s like you can\u2019t help yourself.\n\nJim groans and swears he will never find himself fake-married to Spock ever again.\n\u00a0\n--\n4.\nLife aboard a starship, though, often has other ideas. \nAfter the undercover mission, Spock is slightly more distant. Or, as Jim realizes, slightly more distant than he\u2019s been lately. It\u2019s like the first days of their mission again, when Spock thought that Jim was dangerous, possibly crazy, and needed to be handled with the use of protective gear. \nJim doesn\u2019t quite know what to make of it, and it\u2019s becoming annoying. Spock disappears into his labs \u2013 and for a change he starts rotating them, instead of always going to his favorite Lab 9 \u2013 develops a sudden preference to complete paperwork in his off-duty hours, and feels the need to meditate at least twice as much as he used to. Jim suspects that meditation is complete bull at least half of the time, because the one time he needs Spock urgently for a conference with Command the computer locates him in the ship\u2019s pool. Unless meditation is now code for \u2018I\u2019m punishing myself for something\u2019 \u2013 Spock hates swimming, though he goes to great lengths to maintain his proficiency at it, Jim is definitely being led on.\nIt goes on for over two weeks. Then, they are sent to Pravotis, and this time it\u2019s Uhura\u2019s fault, all Uhura\u2019s fault. Well, maybe a little bit Jim\u2019s, too, but he\u2019s sticking to his guns on this one.\nIt\u2019s a simple fact-gathering mission, a prelude to the upcoming trade negotiations. The Pravoti people are of a similar development level and are overall rather nice, apart from their obsession with protocol in all matters. Jim can\u2019t wait for one of them to get into Starfleet Academy and have their roommate put a sock on the doorknob or mix his colors with his whites.\nHe studies the mission brief relentlessly. He doesn\u2019t have an eidetic memory, but he\u2019s not so bad, either. Uhura quizzes him. Spock quizzes him. By the time they both pronounce him ready, Jim isn\u2019t sure he can ever look at interior d\u00e9cor the same way again, that is without analyzing the relative position of the furniture as a means to communicate the host\u2019s social status, but that\u2019s par for the course.\nHe does well, is the thing. Spending an entire day constantly on alert for endless rules and twists and turns of etiquette is draining, but he doesn\u2019t err once. A couple of times he has to wing it, but guesses right, so that doesn\u2019t count. There\u2019s only the evening banquet left to endure, and Jim fully intends to simply do what Uhura does, because his mind is reaching the overload point.\nHe has to take an urgent call from Scotty and is the last one to enter the ceremony hall where everyone is already seated along the long table. There is only one free chair left, right next to Spock in the middle of the table, and Jim smiles for the first time that day. It might not be so unbearable if he has access to Spock\u2019s sotto voce social commentary, which is always delightfully on the sarcastic side. Jim walks up right to him and sits down.\nThe entire hall goes silent.\nUhura, seated directly across from Jim, stares at him with horrified eyes. That\u2019s when Jim remembers that the correct thing to do would have been to ask one of the Pravoti officials to trade places with him. Sitting next to one of their own is considered a great insult to the host. \nJim clears his throat, blood rushing to his cheeks. He looks at Uhura, mirroring her horror, but his mind is blank. Diplomatic etiquette is something he avoids at all costs, but he tried, dammit. It\u2019s just not his forte.\nThe Arch Councilor is frowning with all three sets of eyebrows, and that means they\u2019re in deep shit. Uhura jumps to her feet.\n\u201cMy apologies, Arch Councilor, for failure to inform you,\u201d she says contritely, bowing in his direction. \u201cBy the Pravoti custom, mated pairs are required to sit together during social gatherings. Captain Kirk and Commander Spock are life-mates,\u201d she uses the Pravoti term. \u201cForgive my oversight, the fault is mine.\u201d\nJim stares at her, half in admiration, half in shock. He hears a distinctive if quiet sigh drifting from Spock\u2019s direction.\n\u201cAn oversight indeed,\u201d the Arch Councilor agrees gravely, but his frown is lessening. \u201cBut you are aliens and cannot be expected to master our customs completely in a matter of a day. That you show willingness to do so must be enough. It is forgiven.\u201d\nJim has the distinct impression that they\u2019ve just been handed a gold star saying \u2018You tried\u2019, but at this point he\u2019s not choosy. Between being mildly humiliated and creating an interstellar incident, he\u2019ll pick humiliation any time.\nThe trouble is, now he\u2019s stuck with Spock for the rest of their time on the planet. Life-mates, according to Pravoti custom, are supposed to always stay near each other, preferably touching thus informing everyone else of their unavailability. It\u2019s not a bad way to operate society, Jim thinks. Must sure relieve a lot of social tension. It\u2019s that he must now go where he\u2019s clearly not welcome is the problem. \nFor the rest of the evening, Jim is hyper-aware of every point of contact. He tries to keep it innocent and light. A hand on Spock\u2019s forearm. Bumping shoulders. Touching his fingers lightly to Spock\u2019s wrist. It seems to be enough to satisfy the Pravoti protocol, and Spock seems to find it unworthy of special notice, although it must be draining on his shields. Jim is so determined not to screw up again, he nearly panics when at some point during the reception he turns to pat Spock\u2019s shoulder and finds him gone. \nA chuckle breaks through his panic attack. \u201cHe\u2019s allowed to take a bathroom break without you, you know,\u201d Uhura says, coming over, a glass of sparkling wine in her hand. \n\u201cRight.\u201d Jim breathes then grins at her. \u201cThanks for saving my ass in there. I swear I don\u2019t know how that happened, I damn well knew what to do. You grilled me yourself, you know I did, I just blacked out or something.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I know.\u201d Uhura nods, looking sympathetic for once. \u201cIt\u2019s like walking on a social minefield, you can\u2019t relax for a second, but at some point, autopilot takes over.\u201d \n\u201cNot for you, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nShe grins. \u201cI almost sat down next to Chekov when I walked in. Had to pretend I dropped an earring to get out of it. Imagine explaining that to his mother.\u201d\nChekov\u2019s mother came onboard the Enterprise once when they were orbiting Earth to visit. She cornered Jim in a corridor, waved an antique shotgun in his face, berated him for not taking good enough care of her son \u2013 apparently, he didn\u2019t write home often enough, and then stuffed his mouth with a huge slice of salmon kulebyaka before he could respond. (It was delicious, but he was too terrified to enjoy it.) \n\u201cOuch.\u201d He winces. \u201cA close call.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d She shudders. \u201cAt least you only have Spock to deal with.\u201d\nAnd Pike and his smug lectures. Jim sighs. It\u2019s sort of unfair that Uhura is probably going to get a commendation for the exact same thing that would have earned him another round of \u2018I can\u2019t believe I thought you enlisting in Starfleet was a good idea\u2019.\nSpock returns and announces his presence with a hand on Jim\u2019s shoulder. Jim turns to look at him, smiling guiltily. \n\u201cYou okay?\u201d\nSpock looks Vulcan-ly surprised at the question, that is to say the tiniest bit less expressionless than normal. \n\u201cIndeed, Captain. The Arch Councilor\u2019s aide has just regaled me with a most peculiar piece of information. Apparently, we are not the only ones \u2018courting\u2019 the Pravoti. According to Ms. Wesla, the Klingons have also initiated trade negotiations.\u201d\nJim stares at him. \u201cThe Klingons,\u201d he repeats slowly. \u201cAnd these people. Are involved in trade negotiations?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way the Klingons would put up with any of the Pravoti rules,\u201d Uhura says, frowning. \u201cThey\u2019d sooner shoot everyone than wait for their turn to speak.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Spock agrees in a quiet tone. \u201cYet Ms. Wesla indicated that the negotiations were proceeding well.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure she wasn\u2019t lying?\u201d\n\u201cShe was highly embarrassed that I had accidentally discovered her in her inebriated state. In her anxiousness to get away, she did not have the time to concoct a lie. Of that I am certain.\u201d\n\u201cBut if that\u2019s the case, Uhura\u2019s right, there\u2019s no way the Klingons would do this ridiculous song and dance with the Pravoti, which means it wasn\u2019t necessary for us, either. They\u2019ve been making us jump through the hoops for no reason except for entertainment.\u201d\n\u201cI concur with the first part of your analysis, but disagree with the latter,\u201d Spock says. \u201cThere is a very clear reason for them to be making us \u2018jump through the hoops\u2019 as you say, Captain. We have been so focused on memorizing their social rules and not committing a single faux pas that our attention was rather singularly occupied.\u201d\nJim blinks at him, then looks at Uhura. \u201cYou nearly made a mistake, and you don\u2019t make mistakes. I did make a mistake, and, not that I\u2019m perfect or anything, but I don\u2019t usually make silly ones, unless they involve Risan dancers and alcohol. They\u2019ve been keeping us occupied, because something is happening right now.\u201d\nUhura nods, and Spock says, \u201cA logical assumption.\u201d\nJim looks at him, unable to keep from grinning. \u201cWell then, Mr. Spock. What do you say if we ditch this whole diplomacy gig and go for some good old-fashioned reconnaissance?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll notice that you\u2019re gone,\u201d Uhura points out, scanning the room. \n\u201cNot if you explain to them with your usual amount of tact that Spock and I have become life-mates rather recently and are still in that phase where we can\u2019t keep our hands off each other.\u201d\nSpock actually steps back from him, dropping his hand. \u201cLieutenant, you will do no such thing.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes, she will.\u201d Jim is still smiling, but there\u2019s steel in his voice now. \u201cFirst, because I outrank you. Second, because come on, Spock, under the circumstances, there\u2019s no better excuse for the two of us to disappear for a few hours, and you know it. It writes itself really.\u201d\nUhura gives Spock a sympathetic look. \u201cHe\u2019s right. If you go now, I can cover for you.\u201d\nJim nudges his shoulder with his own. \u201cYield to the logic of it, honey.\u201d\nSpock gives him what Jim has come to know as his death glare, which means Jim has won.\nWhich is how two and a half hours later, he finds himself pressed against Spock in a cargo container, trying to take very shallow breaths, because the stench is unbelievable.\n\u201cNot quite what I imagined for the honeymoon,\u201d Jim grumbles.\nThe container around them shudders in a very telling way.\n\u201cCaptain,\u201d Spock says slowly, \u201cI believe the ship has just\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014gone into warp,\u201d Jim finishes. \u201cAwesome.\u201d He shifts, trying to return some feeling into his arm. \u201cWe have about three more hours until they\u2019re going to miss us down on the planet. Maybe a little more, because Uhura can spin a really good tale. We have that much time to get the girl and bring her back for some much deserved spanking. The Arch Councilor is grateful, the Klingons are vanquished, we sign the damn treaty, and Starfleet can deal with the rest of it. Piece of cake.\u201d\n\u201cI foresee a small complication with that plan.\u201d\n\u201cIs it that we\u2019re currently going at warp speed in the opposite direction or that we\u2019re stuffed in a box?\u201d\n\u201cI foresee two complications.\u201d\n\u201cAw, come on, Spock. You hacked the Orion defenses from orbit. You\u2019re telling me you can\u2019t find your way out of a box?\u201d\n\u201cThis is a targ cage,\u201d Spock says with what may or may not have been a sigh. \u201cIt does not have a way out, only a way in. The logical thing to do would be to wait until the Klingons are ready for their next meal and come to retrieve the animal.\u201d\n\u201cSee, not a problem then.\u201d\n\u201cThe Klingons are known to fast for several days leading up to an important battle or achievement.\u201d\n\u201cKlingons fast?\u201d\n\u201cAre you criticizing another culture\u2019s spiritual practice, Captain?\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it. I just hope somebody\u2019s hungry on this boat, because a) we don\u2019t have a few days and b) I heard Qo\u2019noS has lousy weather this time of year.\u201d\n\u201cQo\u2019noS has had \u2018lousy weather\u2019 year-round for the last two centuries, Captain. I concur with the sentiment, however. It would be most unfortunate.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do they want with the Arch Councilor\u2019s daughter anyway?\u201d Jim has despaired of his attempts to make himself comfortable and simply sags against the wall. \u201cI mean, I get why she thinks she\u2019s here \u2013 she\u2019s obviously crazy about that helm officer. Very star-crossed lovers and all that. But I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not why the Klingons are giving her a lift and at warp.\u201d\n\u201cThe most logical assumption would be that she is to be married the moment the ship assumes orbit around Qo\u2019noS. Not to the helm officer, of course, though he, I believe, is unaware of it, but to one of their senior generals. That way not only do they get a high-ranking hostage, but also, if memory serves, Pravoti brides come with a dowry. In the case of the Arch Councilor\u2019s daughter, that dowry might very well entail\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014the whole planet and its dilithium deposits,\u201d Jim finishes grimly. \u201cThat would explain why the Klingons didn\u2019t go for their usual surrender-or-die shtick. They can get the planet without a single shot fired if they manage to legitimize their claim. Damn, I wish someone in Starfleet had thought of that.\u201d\n\u201cIf they had, the most likely candidate for such an arrangement would have been a starship captain. Would you volunteer?\u201d\n\u201cAh, but I already have a husband, Mr. Spock, and he\u2019s the jealous type.\u201d\n\u201cHe is not,\u201d Spock sounds pained. \u201cIn fact, if I could convince you to transfer your apparent matrimonial zeal to another subject\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot a chance, I like torturing you too much. Then again, how come you don\u2019t come with a dowry? I keep marrying you yet I get nothing for my trouble.\u201d\n\u201cAnother clear indicator that you should desist then.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, not likely.\u201d Jim pauses. \u201cI am sorry though that you had to suffer through all of that back on Pravotis.\u201d\nConfusion seeps into Spock\u2019s voice, as he asks, \u201cPardon me, Captain, I was aware of no undue suffering on my part. To what are you referring?\u201d\nJim shifts to look at him, pointless as it is with no light. \u201cWell, I had to keep touching you to satisfy their stupid customs. Yes, Mr. Spock, I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m criticizing another culture\u2019s social mores, to hell with it. They didn\u2019t make any allowances for your culture or mine, for that matter. It had to be \u2013 taxing \u2013 for you to have me all over you like that.\u201d\nHe can\u2019t see squat, but the warm darkness pressed against his left side is distinctly amused. \n\u201cCaptain, are you under the impression perhaps that your behavior toward me on the planet was in any way different than your normal conduct while on the Enterprise?\u201d\nJim freezes. \u201cYou\u2019re saying it wasn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps only marginally.\u201d Oh yeah, Spock definitely sounds amused. If he were human, he\u2019d be laughing. \u201cJim, you touch me all the time. You touch everyone all the time, and you make no exception for me. That is part of how you interact with the world. I have long noticed and accepted this.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Jim sputters and tries to create some space between them, except there\u2019s no room for him to move. Spock waits him out calmly. Jim deflates, face burning. \u201cYou never said anything. I\u2019d have stopped if I realized\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI am grateful for your willingness to respect my culture, Captain. I did not object because I also appreciate your desire to include me into yours.\u201d\nJim is silent for a long beat, not trusting himself to speak. When at long last he can manage, he says, \u201cI\u2019m writing that down the first chance I get. Next time we\u2019re fake married I\u2019m using that as marriage vows.\u201d\nHe could swear Spock rolls his eyes at him. \n\u201cCaptain, must you persist in this most illogical\u2014\u201d He falls silent abruptly and squeezes Jim\u2019s arm in warning. \u201cI believe,\u201d he whispers, \u201cthat your prediction has come true, Captain. Someone is hungry.\u201d\nJim nods; he can hear it too. \u201cReady to play targ, Mr. Spock? Maybe you could growl?\u201d\nSpock elbows him in the ribs with uncanny precision, and Jim\u2019s quiet \u2018oof\u2019 is enough. The front wall of the cage falls out with a crash. Spock jumps left, Jim rolls to the right, and everything dissolves in the chaos of loud cursing and cold weapons flying, because no one slaughters their targ with disruptor fire. All in all, it\u2019s a happy coincidence that on this particular occasion no targs were harmed.\n--\n\u201cThey already think you\u2019re some kind of sex fiend,\u201d Uhura tells him almost six hours later, when Jim and Spock drag a sobbing but compliant girl into the reception hall between them. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to help, I just have to warn you on that.\u201d\n\u201cNoted,\u201d Jim replies, sparing a glance over his torn clothes and Spock\u2019s missing upper shirt. \u201cBut I think next to the biggest social scandal in Pravoti history, we\u2019re hardly going to make a bleep on their radar.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a small matter of that Klingon Bird-of-Prey in orbit,\u201d Uhura says, matching her steps to theirs. \u201cI don\u2019t think Starfleet Command will accept you classifying it as \u2018loot.\u2019\u201d\nJim whines. \u201cUhura, I already have a headache from where this one\u2019s Klingon paramour had hit me with a wrench. If you can think of a better way to explain it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Spock interjects, \u201ca dowry, Captain? For this young lady when she is prepared to select her life-mate in a proper Pravoti fashion? A wedding gift from the Federation to further our good relations with the Pravoti people.\u201d\nThe girl shows signs of life for the first time since the entire plot was revealed, lifting her head, a cascade of white curls falling back from her face. \u201cMy father would forgive any breaches of etiquette on your part for a prize like that,\u201d she says miserably. \u201cThough I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll forgive me.\u201d\n\u201cBut he\u2019ll have to be nice to you anyway, since it\u2019s your dowry,\u201d Jim points out. That seems to cheer her up. Jim looks at Spock over her head. \u201cYou know, when we started this mission, this isn\u2019t at all how I thought it would go. Girls and dowries and stuff. And I have said the word \u2018dowry\u2019 in the last four hours more than I ever have in my entire life.\u201d\n\u201cDo not despair, Captain. I am confident our service will yet find a way to accommodate your predilection for displays of physical violence as a solution, barbaric as it may be.\u201d\nJim is too tired to keep it up, but grins. \u201cI love you, too, you know. Uhura, go get the Arch Councilor. Let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d\nUhura ends up doing most of the talking, while Jim is having lucid dreams about his bed and Spock is stern and correct for the both of them. When the Arch Councilor begins to look less like he might have a stroke at any moment, Jim pulls out his communicator.\n\u201cEnterprise, three to beam up.\u201d\nHe\u2019s never been so happy to be home, and even a violent if expected attack of McCoy\u2019s hypo can\u2019t ruin it for him.\n\u00a0\n--\n5. \nIt\u2019s not Jim\u2019s fault this time so much as it is his choice, and he doesn\u2019t regret it.\nThey beam down into an ambush. They beam down into an ambush approximately 38.7 % of the time, as Spock reminded him the other day, and now it looks like the statistic will have to be adjusted. Shots are fired just as they have finished materializing, and it\u2019s pure luck that all of them aren\u2019t hit at once. They break apart, looking for cover, and Jim reaches for his communicator, but it\u2019s blown right out of his hand, shocking skin. He can hear Summers scream in pain and is pretty sure Grabov is dead, but he can\u2019t get a proper look. \nThen, the whine comes. Like the deadliest mosquito he\u2019s ever heard, it\u2019s getting closer and closer until he can see it. A projectile weapon of some kind zeroing in on him, ignoring others. He can hear shouts, but is too busy evading, except it\u2019s no use. It\u2019s not bullet-fast, but it\u2019s persistent, avoiding obstacles, eating up the remaining space until he knows he only has seconds, and\u2014\nWHAM.\nSomething heavy knocks him to the ground just before impact, pressing him down, and a moan so full of pain rips the space that Jim feels it slice through his heart. Then, the transporter beam seizes him.\nWithin seconds he\u2019s back on the transporter pad, arms full of Spock. Grabov\u2019s body is behind him, Summers is moaning softly at his other side, but there\u2019s also a mechanical, whirling noise, as well as some slurping. \n\u201cCaptain, don\u2019t move!\u201d Chekov shouts, tricorder in hand, eyes wide with horror. \nOnly then does Jim look down and very nearly throws up. The arrow-missile, or whatever it is, is\u2026 digging into Spock\u2019s ribcage, whirling incessantly, trying to \u2013 to get to Jim. Only now does Jim realize that he\u2019s dripping with hot viscous blood, and he\u2019s been in a skirmish or two with the Romulans, but he\u2019s never seen so much green blood in his life. There are bits of bone in it, his mind supplies, ever-observant, and Spock is motionless against him, unresisting, pliant like a ragdoll.\n\u201cIts guidance system is still locked on you,\u201d Chekov says, pushing the words out. \u201cIf you move, it\u2019ll move with you, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d He cuts himself off. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do something to deactivate this thing. An EM pulse or\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCaptain, it could stop your heart!\u201d\n\nWhirl-slurp. Whirl-slurp. Whirl-slurp.\n\n\u201cNow, Mr. Chekov. That\u2019s a damn order.\u201d\nChekov rushes to the toolkit to get a resonator, shouting for the techs on duty to call Medical, because apparently no one has done so yet. They are all fired, Jim thinks, fingers curling around Spock\u2019s arms, unfeeling. All of them. All\u2014\nHe blacks out, but only for a few moments. McCoy\u2019s yelling fills the room, reverberating between the walls, and for once he doesn\u2019t spare Jim a glance, arranging Spock on the floor and ordering Chekov to beam them directly to the surgical unit. Jim watches them dematerialize in some kind of torpor, then sits up slowly.\nSummers is being wheeled out on a stretcher, and someone\u2019s already removed Grabov\u2019s body. Jim\u2019s drenched in blood, his shirt clinging to him unpleasantly, dripping from the hem and sleeves. \n\u201cCaptain, are you all right?\u201d Chekov asks, worriedly, pale as a sheet.\nJim looks up at him, feeling nothing. \u201cAbsolutely fine, Ensign.\u201d He pushes off the deck, his body obeying without fault, but it feels like someone else is wearing it. \u201cI want an analysis of that weapon in my queue within an hour.\u201d\nChekov snaps to it. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\nJim has never before appreciated how long it takes to get to Medbay from the transporter room. His walk is purposeful and measured. He steadily ignores people jumping out of his way, plastering themselves against the walls, eyes terrified as they watch him pass. He sees them, yet sees no one.\nHe steps inside the brightly lit Medbay, filled with organized activity. He passes Summers being treated, eyes scanning the readout on the monitors. A flesh wound. Good, nothing to worry about. Someone, probably a nurse, calls out to him, but he ignores her. He walks up to the surgical unit and plants himself on the carpet in front of it. \nHe sees nothing through the opaqued window, but someone probably spots him, because a few minutes later, Nurse Chapel emerges, wrapped head-to-toe in her surgical garb.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can, Captain,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the damage is severe. Doctor McCoy says you should prepare yourself.\u201d\nHe nods at her sagely. \u201cThank you, Ms. Chapel.\u201d\nHe leaves. By then, the news of him wandering the ship looking like death has obviously spread, because the staring is kept to a minimum. He\u2019s got a good crew.\n\u201cMr. Sulu, report,\u201d Jim demands as he steps into the bridge.\n\u201cShip\u2019s functions normal, Captain,\u201d his helmsman replies steadily. \u201cI\u2019ve put security on high alert.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Jim says. \u201cI need a squad armed with phasers in the transporter room in five minutes. I\u2019m beaming back down.\u201d\n\u201cCaptain, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s wise. They\u2019ve already tried to kill you once. What\u2019s to stop them from trying again?\u201d\nJim smiles. \u201cHaven\u2019t you read the mission briefing, Mr. Sulu? It\u2019s the way the Karronians conduct themselves when they feel threatened. They made an opening move, killed one of our own. The next move is ours. And I intend to make it.\u201d\n\u201cSir, our orders from Starfleet are to ensure their cooperation in the rubindium mining expedition,\u201d Uhura says, stepping down from her station. \u201cWe can\u2019t risk offending them.\u201d\nWhat did it cost her to say that, Jim wonders. She must know by now. Chekov would have told them.\n\u201cI\u2019m well aware of that, Lieutenant,\u201d he replies. \u201cI intend to fully comply with their tradition, nothing more.\u201d\n\u201cCaptain, their tradition dictates\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI did read the mission briefing, Lieutenant, thank you. Suspend your disbelief. Prepare a preliminary report for Starfleet, but don\u2019t send it yet.\u201d\nShe looks at him a moment longer, but only a moment. \u201cAye, sir.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Sulu, while I\u2019m down on the planet, you\u2019re in command. Maintain alert status. I\u2019ll contact you when I can.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir. Captain?\u201d\nJim turns back to him, impatient. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cRespectfully, maybe you should change before you beam down, sir.\u201d Sulu\u2019s eyes are glued to his shirt.\nJim looks down, smiling in polite puzzlement. \u201cWhy, Lieutenant? I believe everything\u2019s in order.\u201d\nSulu swallows as he meets his eyes. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\nThis time, when Jim beams down, he\u2019s greeted by a delegation. A two-dozen squad of well-armed Karronians sneer at him. \n\u201cCaught you off guard like helpless children, Federation. A worthy ally you prove to be indeed.\u201d\nJim ignores them. \u201cTake me to Chief Ksar. I have a personal matter to settle.\u201d\n\u201cWhat personal matter could you have with the chief, Federation?\u201d\nJim bares his teeth. \u201cI bring him the challenge of kvaar\u2019ti. If he refuses my claim, know that he\u2019s a coward unworthy to lead you.\u201d\nA disturbed murmur fills the air, replacing lighthearted mockery. The squad commander lifts up a hand, a universal call for silence, and regards Jim with narrowed eyes, lingering on his blood-soaked shirt. \n\u201cFollow me,\u201d he says at last. \u201cBut your men stay here.\u201d\n\u201cMy men come with me to bear witness. They will not interfere. It is my right.\u201d\nThe commander looks none too happy about that, but agrees with a curt nod. \u201cVery well.\u201d\nThe walk is short, barely two hundred meters. Jim is lead into the town square, the ground turned to stone by hundreds of feet marching day in and day out. On the dais directly beneath the temple gates, Chief Ksar is conferring with his men but turns toward the newcomers.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d he demands, eyes flickering to the commander in anger, before coming to rest op Jim. \u201cHave you come here to complain, Federation? We do not hear the words of weaklings.\u201d\nJim undoes his belt, allowing his phaser and communicator drop to the ground, and marches forward. \n\u201cChief Ksar of the Clan Orresta. You killed my mate. I demand the right of kvaar\u2019ti. I challenge you.\u201d\nThe Karronian regards him coolly, a calculating look. He dares not back down in front of his men, but if he comes up with some excuse\u2026 \n\u201cAre you a man of justice or aren\u2019t you?\u201d Jim gauds him. \u201cIf you refuse to fight, let it be known that you\u2019re a coward and a weakling.\u201d\nKsar\u2019s eyes narrow into slits. \u201cThe right of kvaar\u2019ti doesn\u2019t give you the right to insult me, Federation captain. Very well. I will fight you, human. Maybe I can reunite you with your mate.\u201d\nRoom is made for them in the center of the square, a circle of red sand marking the sacred battle ground. Ksar steps down, throwing off his cloak. He\u2019s a head taller and built like a bull. Jim grins up at him.\n\u201cCaptain\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou are to witness only, Mr. Hendorff. And if I am dead, you take my body back to the ship, nothing more. Is that clear?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, Chief.\u201d Jim has never taken his eyes off the Karronian. \u201cShall we begin?\u201d\nHis mind is remarkably clear. He attacks and parries, defends and counterattacks, present in every movement, alive only in the moment. There is no thought, no doubt, no guessing game. No fear. His body is honed for this, trained for this, and Ksar might have bested every single one of his warriors in single combat, but the people who invented a weapon as cowardly as that missile-arrow will never hold the higher ground. \nAnger sips in with that thought and Jim\u2019s concentration slips, causing him to miss a vicious blow that nearly ends it there. \nNo mind. No thought. No emotion. He repeats it like a mantra as he rolls away, coming back to his feet, whirling in place and striking, ignoring the pain in his broken ribs. There is no pain in the moment. There is only one way this will end. Moments stretch around him and through him. He knows he\u2019s done it when he sees a flicker of fear in Ksar\u2019s eyes.\nIt\u2019s over before he knows it, though later Hendorff will tell him that close to an hour has passed. Jim doesn\u2019t feel it. Holding Ksar in a headlock, he stares down at him, and for the first time in his life understands the urge to kill. It would be so easy now, just a twist of his hands, barely any effort. \nBut the part of him that is a starship captain steps forward. If he kills Ksar, another from his clan will take his place, and obviously they\u2019re no fans of the Federation. But if he refuses to kill him, the humiliation will force him to step down, leaving the throne empty for the next best warrior. Regretfully, Jim grips Ksar\u2019s neck until the chief loses consciousness and throws him down in disgust.\nHe stands up and looks around in absolute silence. His shirt is now stained with purple blood as well as green, and his hands are steady.\n\u201cKsar is breathing still,\u201d he announces, enunciating clearly. \u201cBut he is your Chief no longer. I have defeated him, but I have no interest in ruling over you weaklings.\u201d He looks around and noticing the squad commander who had greeted him, motions him forward. \u201cWhat are you called, warrior?\u201d\n\u201cTrav of the Clan Harug.\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations, you\u2019re the new Chief of Karronia, as all these men are witness. It is done.\u201d\nThe entire square echoes him. \u201cIt is done.\u201d\nJim smiles at Chief Trav. \u201cFan-fucking-tastic. Now, shall we talk business?\u201d\nHe beams back to the ship an hour later, a newly signed treaty in hand. A nurse is waiting for him in the transporter room. Jim grits his teeth and doesn\u2019t ask, allowing her to mend his ribs. It\u2019s a patch, but it\u2019ll do for now.\nHe goes up to the bridge and stalks toward Uhura\u2019s station. Her eyes are wide as she takes him in, but she says nothing.\n\u201cFile this with Command,\u201d he tells her, handing her the treaty. The document \u2013 and it\u2019s some honest-to-God paper \u2013 is stained in blood, but she takes it without flinching. \u201cPriority one.\u201d\n\u201cAye, sir.\u201d\nJim goes up to the central seat, waving Sulu back down. \u201cMr. Sulu, stand down from general quarters. Set a course for Starbase 16, warp factor two. You\u2019re in command until I relieve you or until shift change, whichever comes first.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Captain.\u201d\nOnly as he steps into the turbolift, Jim remembers he never told them where he\u2019d be. Doesn\u2019t matter. Not like they don\u2019t know anyway.\nHe stalks into his quarters and strips, stuffing his uniform, even his boots into the disposal unit. He puts the sonic shower on maximum and lets it pounder his body until he feels sore with it. He dresses meticulously as though getting ready for inspection, only unlike some sniveling first-year cadet he gets everything right on his first try. He leaves.\nHis feet carry him as though on autopilot until he finds himself outside the surgical unit again. There is no waiting area, so Jim sits on the deck, his back to the wall and waits.\nAlmost nine hours later a grey-faced McCoy steps out, swaying on his feet slightly. He doesn\u2019t seem surprised to see the captain sitting on the floor. He crouches down in front of him, and it\u2019s the hardest thing Jim has ever done to meet his eyes.\n\u201cIt was a race against time,\u201d McCoy says, voice hoarse and rough from hours of tension. \u201cWe\u2019ve repaired the bone damage, and the organ damage. Well, some of it. Blood vessels took the longest time, there were just so many bleeders...\u201d He closes his eyes for a moment. \u201cSorry. We\u2019ll continue to give him plasma, but that\u2019s about it at this point. He\u2019ll live or die now, Jim. I don\u2019t know which.\u201d\nJim nods. \u201cThank you, Doctor. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done everything you could.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Bones winces. He surveys Jim critically. \u201cYou\u2019re staying, I take it? You do know, we had to restart your heart, too, after that stunt you had Chekov pull?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m staying.\u201d\nMcCoy nods. \u201cI have a cot in my office.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m staying here.\u201d\nJim\u2019s heart absolutely doesn\u2019t plummet when he realizes Bones isn\u2019t going to fight him on this. \n\u201cRight.\u201d McCoy pulls himself upright slowly, moving like a man twice his age. \u201cThey have orders to get me if anything changes.\u201d\nJim nods, says nothing, doesn\u2019t watch him go.\nHe imagines if they were down on a planet somewhere, the sun would go up and then down, and he still wouldn\u2019t have moved. People come and go. At some point a nurse comes up to him to wave a scanner over him. It\u2019s Chapel. He doesn\u2019t look at her, but he recognizes the perfume. Her fingers squeeze his shoulder before she leaves.\nSix hours later, McCoy comes back, and this time he\u2019s not in a generous mood.\n\u201cAll right, Jim, up you get. You have a ship to run or have you forgotten?\u201d\nJim looks up at him, surprised at the pain in his neck. \u201cWe\u2019re at warp en route to a starbase. What do you think they could possibly need me for?\u201d\n\u201cThey need to know you\u2019re okay, dammit. You\u2019re the captain, Captain. You can\u2019t afford to fall to pieces.\u201d McCoy waves a PADD in his face. \u201cEfficiency\u2019s down eight to twelve percent throughout the ship, did you know that?\u201d He pauses, glancing at the screen. \u201cExcept for the science department, apparently. Theirs is up point-two.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I think Spock beats them.\u201d\n\u201cJim.\u201d McCoy sighs. \u201cGet the hell out. I don\u2019t care what you do, but the crew needs to know they\u2019re not losing both of you.\u201d\n\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Jim says slowly before he can stop the words, before he even knows it, \u201che jumped in front of me. When it was clear there was no getting away from that thing. He jumped in front of me. I didn\u2019t even see him.\u201d\nMcCoy crouches down next to him. \u201cThen I guess I owe the hobgoblin another one. If that was you, you\u2019d be dead before you finished beaming.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\u201cIt never is, kid. Now please get out of here, you\u2019re scaring my staff.\u201d\nJim nods and extends a hand. McCoy pulls him up, and Jim nearly topples over. \u201cOw.\u201d\nMcCoy rolls his eyes. \u201cServes you right for sitting for so long in one position. Here\u201d \u2013 he brandishes a hypo he\u2019s pulled out apparently from thin air \u2013 \u201ca muscle relaxant. Should have left you creaking, but the last thing the crew needs right now is to see you hobbling out of here.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Jim nods, straightening with a curious sense of detachment. His eyes drift toward the still opaque window. \u201cIf there\u2019s any change\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re my first call.\u201d McCoy grips his shoulder. \u201cGo on then.\u201d\nJim leaves. The crew is visibly relieved to see him, and Jim feels a pang of guilt. He never served on a starship in any capacity other than a captain. Every command track class he\u2019d ever taken had pressed on the importance of leadership. The crew draws strength and confidence form their captain. Jim knows this, theoretically, but he has never felt it, never realized just how much of a symbiotic relationship that is until today.\nWhen he steps out onto the bridge and Uhura\u2019s face melts in relief \u2013 Uhura of all people \u2013 he gets it.\n\u201cNo news, sir?\u201d she asks quietly as he stops by her station.\n\u201cNo news.\u201d He squeezes her shoulder. \nSulu is still in command, which at this point isn\u2019t surprising. Jim sends him off to get some sleep and takes the chair. On a whim he decides to check on what\u2019s keeping the science department so occupied. \nApparently, it\u2019s some really advanced math exploring the relationship between a star\u2019s gravitational emissions and time. Some months ago, Spock had postulated that a slingshot run around the sun could result in time regression. An intriguing theory which they had had no time to explore. By the looks of it, at the moment, his team is pulling triple shifts trying to prove him right. They\u2019ve pulled every single person in on this, including biologists and geologists and other unrelated specialists, who\u2019d taken over the rest of the work, leaving everyone who has so much as a smidgen of background in astrophysics and applied math to focus on this. Also, they have apparently kidnapped Chekov. Hopefully, they remember to feed him.\nJim shakes his head. It\u2019s entirely possible that by this time tomorrow he\u2019ll find himself walking the streets of some other version of the Roman Empire. In all likelihood he won\u2019t remember this then, so he doesn\u2019t care all that much. Besides, he\u2019s pretty sure there\u2019s only one person onboard who could make them stop at this point, and he\u2019s currently unavailable.\nHours stretch. He completes his paperwork, approves duty rosters, checks in with department heads. He goes off shift as scheduled, eats in the mess, goes back to his cabin. He stretches out on his bed and lies staring up at the ceiling for four hours. Then, he gets up and begins a new day.\nHe\u2019s reading reports from Starfleet Intelligence in his ready room that evening when McCoy finally calls him. The first thing Jim notices when he walks into Medbay is that Spock\u2019s been moved from the surgical unit to the ICU. Jim steps in hesitantly, staring.\nSpock\u2019s pale. No, not pale. White. A complete absence of color. Jim looks up at the monitors and blinks at the barely-there readings. He\u2019s not ready for this. He thought he was, but\u2014\n\u201cJim.\u201d McCoy turns to him, eyes bright with \u2013 are those tears? \u201cJim, it\u2019s the healing trance. He\u2019s slipped into it half an hour ago. Jim, he\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d\nJim grips the doorframe hard for balance. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cPositive.\u201d\nJim exhales. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to hit him when it\u2019s time to come out of it, yes? Call me. I have a lot of energy saved.\u201d\nMcCoy laughs. \u201cProbably the only chance you\u2019ll get to kick his ass. I\u2019ll call you. Might be a few days, though. He has a lot of healing to do.\u201d\nIt takes almost four days. Enough time for them to reach the starbase, load up supplies, and depart to do some extensive star charting \u2013 and Jim\u2019s never been so happy to give the science department something else to do. When McCoy does call though, Jim\u2019s on subspace talking to Admiral Komack and has to stay put. By the time he gets down to Medbay, Spock\u2019s awake.\nJim stops in the doorway, out of sight, just watching.\n\u201c\u2014I assure you it is unnecessary,\u201d Spock is saying, sitting on the biobed primly. \u201cYou know perfectly well that I am fully functional within minutes of coming out of the trance, Doctor.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you, stay put and let me check you out, you ungrateful hobgoblin,\u201d an incredibly irate McCoy answers. \u201cYou have no idea what I had to do to keep your guts \u2013 whatever was left of them \u2013 on the inside of your body. You lost over four liters of blood, do you get that? I don\u2019t care how efficient that Vulcan voodoo of yours is, you\u2019re fit when I say you\u2019re fit.\u201d\nSpock gives him a curious look, but miraculously says nothing. McCoy scans him three times for good measure, adjusts some settings and scans him again. He then does something he almost never does when he treats Spock \u2013 takes his arm to test the muscle resistance manually. Spock\u2019s eyebrow climbs up, but he allows it without a word, eyes never leaving McCoy\u2019s face.\n\u201cI thank you for your efforts, Doctor,\u201d Spock says quietly.\nMcCoy closes his eyes for a moment then lowers Spock\u2019s hand slowly. \u201cYeah well, don\u2019t do that again. Ain\u2019t the same without your logic annoying the crap out of me.\u201d He sighs and without looking up calls out, \u201cSomething to say, Jim?\u201d\nJim jumps slightly. Spock turns to look at him, unsurprised, brown eyes warm. \n\u201cWho, me?\u201d Jim says, stepping inside. \u201cNever.\u201d\n\u201cDamn straight.\u201d McCoy presses a hypo into Spock\u2019s neck with excessive force as though to compensate for a moment of weakness. \u201cYou\u2019re on medical leave for the next two days, no, shut up, I don\u2019t want to hear it. Eat, meditate, sleep. Lots of greens, lots of liquid. You still have about a liter of blood to rebuild.\u201d\n\u201cI will adhere to your restrictions, Doctor.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d McCoy shakes the hypo menacingly before pushing past Jim to the door. \nIt\u2019s not a conscious decision, Jim\u2019s feet simply bring him closer. Spock slides off the bed to face him, the light blue medical scrubs highlighting just how pale he is still. Only his eyes are dark, rich in color. Jim drinks it in.\n\u201cCaptain?\u201d Spock lifts an eyebrow, a concerned inquiry.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do something,\u201d someone using Jim\u2019s vocal chords says. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like it and probably don\u2019t get it. But I need to do this. Just this once, Spock, bear with me.\u201d\nJim steps closer still and puts his arms around Spock, pulling him into a full-body hug. Spock freezes for a moment. Then, tentatively, almost shyly, his hands come to rest on Jim\u2019s back. \n\u201cIt was \u2013 that bad?\u201d he asks softly, his careful articulation of a decidedly human phrase making Jim laugh. \n\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d Jim murmurs, burying his face in Spock\u2019s neck, inhaling deeply. There, underneath the sterile smell of Medbay, is the familiar scent that he didn\u2019t know he could identify, let alone miss. \u201cYour science minions were ready to go back in time to get you.\u201d\n\u201cSurely you would not have allowed this.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, Mr. Spock,\u201d Jim says, making himself pull back. \u201cI have a feeling they wouldn\u2019t have taken no for an answer.\u201d\n\u201cFortunately, there is no need for such drastic measures.\u201d\nJim squeezes his shoulders. \u201cYeah. Fortunate, that.\u201d He knows he needs to let go, but can\u2019t seem to make it happen. \u201cFair warning, you might be dealing with a particularly touchy-feely crew for a few days, until they remember their manners.\u201d\nThe corners of Spock\u2019s mouth pull up. \u201cI am getting that impression, yes.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Jim grins ruefully and finally, finally steps back. \u201cUm, I need to get back to the bridge.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Captain.\u201d\nJim turns to go before his body decides that Spock looking at him like that, eyes soft and filled with gentle humor, is a good enough reason to do something really inappropriate.\n\u201cJim,\u201d Spock\u2019s voice stops him at the door.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cI would appreciate, that is, if you can spare the time after your shift and are not excessively tired\u2014\u201d\nJim grins. \u201cYou want an update on the ship\u2019s status, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cIt would be most welcome. I do not wish to disobey Doctor McCoy\u2019s orders, however, a verbal account would not violate his terms\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou got it. We can have dinner and I\u2019ll bring you up to speed.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Captain.\u201d\nJim leaves.\nStarfleet commends him for his creative resolution of the Korrinian situation. Jim very nearly tells them where to stick it, but doesn\u2019t. \nThe slingshot theory definitely has potential, Spock tells him when he is cleared for duty. The math, as it happens, bears it out. He doesn\u2019t try to conceal his enthusiasm. Jim pats him on the back and makes a mental note to fire everyone in the science department before they can take over the ship with the combined power of their intellect and apparent crazy. \nSpock looks like he can read Jim\u2019s mind and very pointedly doesn\u2019t roll his eyes as he skulks back to his station. Uhura winks at Jim behind his back, and Jim grins at her. \nAll is well.\n\u00a0\n--\n6. \nThe next one \u2013 Jim isn\u2019t around for the next one. More precisely, he\u2019s there but more as a prop than an active agent, and has to subside on what Bones tells him later, which is a damn shame.\n\u201cYour captain became ill on our soil,\u201d the Valesian ambassador repeats for the third time. \u201cOnly our healers can treat him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the Chief Medical Officer of his ship.\u201d McCoy glares at him, advancing. \u201cI\u2019m his personal physician. It\u2019s my duty to treat him \u2013 you can\u2019t deny me that!\u201d\n\u201cIt would be in violation of our most sacred custom, Doctor,\u201d the ambassador replies with infuriating calm and gestures for the guards. \u201cI do not wish to use violence, but if you persist, I will be forced to.\u201d\nMcCoy rounds on Spock, lowering his voice only just. \u201cSpock, you can\u2019t let them carry on with this madness. Jim\u2019s got Rigellian flu, nothing major, but if not treated, it\u2019s fatal, and these people don\u2019t have the vaccine! He\u2019ll die if I don\u2019t treat him.\u201d\nSpock doesn\u2019t acknowledge him with so much as a glance as he steps around McCoy toward the Valesian.\n\u201cAmbassador, we respect your customs. However, I must ask for an indulgence. On Earth, and indeed on the majority of the Federation worlds, the one undeniable custom is that family members are allowed to attend their sick, regardless of the circumstances. I believe, the phrase is, \u2018in sickness and in health.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThat is a custom we share, Mr. Spock,\u201d the ambassador replies primly. \u201cBut I do not believe that, being Captain Kirk\u2019s subordinates, you qualify as family members.\u201d\n\u201cDoctor McCoy is a close friend of the captain, but in the strict official sense you are correct in his case. As for myself, however, the captain and I are life-partners,\u201d he uses the Valesian word with only a hint of a pause. \u201cAccording to your own laws, you cannot deny my right to attend him.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, if you are telling the truth.\u201d The ambassador smiles in a would-be apologetic manner. \u201cIt is said that Vulcans never lie, and I certainly do not wish to insult you, Commander, but the timing of your revelation makes me doubt its validity.\u201d\n\u201cNo offense is taken, Ambassador. However, I am telling the truth. Your healers have examined the captain, have they not?\u201d\nThe Valesian nods, frowning slightly. \n\u201cIn that case, they must have discovered a band of vines tattooed around his upper right arm? It looks identical to this one.\u201d With that, he pulls off his blue shirt in one smooth motion, rolls up the sleeve of his regulation black tee, and demonstrates his own arm for the ambassador\u2019s inspection.\nThe ambassador looks at the healers, who come closer to take a look. They nod at him.\n\u201cIt is a symbol of our union,\u201d Spock explains. \u201cIt was bestowed upon us in celebration of the occasion.\u201d\nSpock is one smooth bastard when he wants to be, McCoy thinks, barely refraining from rolling his eyes. He leaves people with a completely wrong impression, but technically, there\u2019s not a word of lie in anything he\u2019d said. This must be why Vulcans make such good lawyers. Also why they piss everybody off so much. \nHe knew the tattoo was still there of course, but the security ensign looks like he has trouble picking his jaw off the floor. McCoy gives him a sympathetic look. Vulcan striptease would do that to a person.\nThe ambassador, on the other hand, looks like he\u2019s chewing lemons, but denying Spock now would be going against his own words.\n\u201cVery well, Commander. Forgive my doubt. You \u2013 and only you may attend him.\u201d\n\u201cThis way, sir.\u201d One of the healers opens the curtain for him.\nMcCoy steps up to Spock quickly, grabbing his arm, and presses a loaded hypo into his hand while blocking it from view. \n\u201cTwo cc\u2019s every two hours until his fever breaks. If you run out, find an excuse to step out, I\u2019ll give you more.\u201d\nSpock doesn\u2019t look at him, ostensibly busy with his shirt, but he gives a barely-there nod, and his fingers close around the hypospray, concealing it.\n\u201cYou may wait here, Doctor McCoy,\u201d the ambassador indicates a padded bench when Spock disappears from view. \u201cIt is in the hands of the gods now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll pray then,\u201d McCoy grumbles as he sits down. \nAs God is my witness, Jim, if you die from the damn flu, I\u2019ll kill you myself.\n\u00a0\n--\n7. \nBeing released for light duty has its advantages. He feels perfectly fine and has the freedom of the ship, but no one will bother yelling \u2018Captain on the bridge!\u2019 or any such nonsense. This is how Jim sneaks into his ready room to catch the tail end of Spock\u2019s conversation with Pike.\nSpock glances at him over the monitor, but otherwise doesn\u2019t acknowledge his presence. By the slightly constipated look on his face, Jim can guess the subject of the lecture only too well and grins. It\u2019s nice to have the tables turned for a change.\n\u201c\u2014was to save his life, trust me, no one is complaining about that,\u201d Pike is saying. \u201cBut I wonder.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Admiral?\u201d\n\u201cYou were my XO for four years. Before then, it was Number One for six years. We\u2019ve logged plenty of deep-space missions together, yet in all this time, do you know how many times I had to marry my exec in the line of duty?\u201d\n\u201cIf memory serves, never, sir.\u201d\n\u201cMemory serves you fine.\u201d Pike sounds amused. \u201cDo you get what I\u2019m trying to say here, Spock?\u201d\nSpock doesn\u2019t sigh, but looks resigned. \u201cIndeed. Just as I trust you will understand when I say that you have not provided me with any information I did not already have.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a slight pause. \n\u201cI see. I don\u2019t know if I should wish you luck or offer my condolences.\u201d \n\u201cNor I, Admiral. But I appreciate the sentiment.\u201d\n\u201cUntil next time, then, Mr. Spock. Tell Jim I said hi. Pike out.\u201d\nSpock waves the screen off and looks at Jim. \u201cThe admiral conveys his greetings.\u201d\n\u201cI heard.\u201d Jim walks toward him slowly. Leaning on the edge of the desk in front of Spock, he presses his fingers to Spock\u2019s arm briefly. \u201cSo. You kept it. I thought body art was archaic.\u201d\n\u201cIt is. I believed it might prove useful to keep it for the duration of the mission. Demonstrably, I was correct.\u201d\n\u201cAh, but you didn\u2019t know I\u2019d keep mine when you decided to keep yours. You were all surprised, I remember.\u201d\n\u201cHardly surprised. Knowing your personality, it was reasonable to assume\u2014\u201d\nAlmost too fast to follow, Jim leans over and stops the rising flood of logic with a kiss. Spock hesitates only a moment before responding, and suddenly he is standing and Jim is sitting on the desk, pulling Spock in tightly, kissing him until he doesn\u2019t remember anything but that. Spock\u2019s hand slides over Jim\u2019s face, and then he pulls back, looking deliciously affected. \n\u201cJim,\u201d he pleads softly, lips swollen and bright. \u201cI am on duty.\u201d\nJim nods, steals one more kiss to the line of his jaw. He\u2019d spent many an hour fantasizing about biting that stupid line. He\u2019s allowed this one.\n\u201cYour shift ends in two hours. I\u2019ll be in my cabin, resting.\u201d\nSpock looks at him carefully, hand pressed against Jim\u2019s cheek. \u201cIf we do this, the possibility of the mind link reopening spontaneously between us is 96.7%.\u201d \nJim slides his fingers over Spock\u2019s because he can and because watching Spock shiver is making him high. \n\u201cIf we do this more than once, the connection will deepen, until\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014we actually are married.\u201d Jim turns his face to kiss Spock\u2019s palm and is rewarded with a sharp intake of breath. \u201cI thought you told Pike you were paying attention.\u201d\nSpock\u2019s eyes widen slightly. \u201cIndeed. However, I was not certain that you yourself were aware\u2014\u201d\nJim knocks Spock\u2019s hand away and kisses him again, and this time, he\u2019s not taking prisoners. It\u2019s hot, heavy, but not dirty, not yet, it\u2019s just that Spock is so incredibly intoxicating with all the little noises that he doesn\u2019t make but Jim feels run through him anyway.\n\u201cYou told me about T\u2019Pring,\u201d Jim breathes into the space between them. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to. I remembered \u2013 afterwards.\u201d\nSpock looks instantly enlightened. \u201cI see. At the time, it was not my intention to instigate\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Jim grins, slides off the desk, brushing deliberately against him, hands lifting to straighten Spock\u2019s shirt for him, brush his hair back in place. \nSpock watches him with amusement. \u201cAm I now presentable?\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d Jim looks over his handiwork critically, using all of his willpower not to kiss him again. He had no idea he had that much willpower. \u201cGive it two minutes, Commander. Chekov\u2019s too young to die of a heart attack.\u201d\nSpock shakes his head, but makes no move to follow him. \u201cThis match will be impossible to explain to my people.\u201d \nHe doesn\u2019t look too broken up about it. If anything, he seems stoically delighted by the idea.\nJim looks back at him from the doorway and smirks. \u201cJust tell them I come with a dowry, Spock. The next Bird-of-Prey we run across is all yours.\u201d\nThe look of horrified fascination on Spock\u2019s face is making Jim\u2019s year, mostly because neither of them can be certain he\u2019s joking at this point, and Spock just \u2013 rolls with it.\nIf there are better foundations for a life-long partnership, Jim honestly doesn\u2019t care.\n--"
