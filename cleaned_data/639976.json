    "text": "\n prologue \n\n* * *\n\u00a0\nJohn Watson is left-handed.\nHe\u2019s tried not to let it affect his life, but as any Lefty knows, that\u2019s almost impossible.\nThey\u2019d given him the pamphlets in primary school, at Evaluation. The pamphlets that said it was perfectly normal, that 10 percent of the population is left-handed, that it\u2019s possible as a Lefty to have a worthy career and a house and (right-handed) children. One pamphlet had a cartoon image of two stupidly happy big-eyed kids raising their hands, one left, one right:\u00a0Lefties Are Just Like Everyone Else, it said.\nJohn wondered why he needed a special pamphlet to tell him he was just like everyone else, if he was just like everyone else. No one else got a pamphlet.\nIt\u2019s not like he comes from a family with outstanding knacks, but the rest of them are all Right; they\u2019ve all got\u00a0something. His parents are dead now, but his mother could break eggs perfectly, every single time. And his father, who drove a lorry, never once needed to ask for directions in his life. His sister Harry\u2019s knack caused his mum no end of trouble -- and it continues to cause John no end of trouble -- but a troublesome knack has always seemed better than none at all.\n\u201cNone\u201d is the four-letter word that follows a Lefty everywhere. On a passport, drivers\u2019 license, taxes, any official form: the checkbox. Knack classification: Mental, physical, elemental, incidental, ornamental, judgemental, transcendental,\u00a0none. Check.\nAnd there are the glances, the knowing, sometimes pitying glances that John absorbs on a daily basis whenever he picks up a pen or a fork. He doesn\u2019t blame anyone, not really. They\u2019re all conditioned to react, even if they\u2019d never admit it. He notices Lefties too, after all.\nSo he pretends it\u2019s all fine, that he\u2019s never cared about having a knack, because God knows it probably would have been something useless anyway. It would have been folding origami cranes, or whistling Bach underwater. Cussing in five languages, maybe. He knew a bloke in school who had that one.\nA truly exceptional knack is rare, far more rare than being a Lefty. That\u2019s what the Evaluation is for: not to weed out the Lefties, but to find those exceptionally rare knacks. It\u2019s not like Lefties need to be weeded out, anyway; it\u2019s usually pretty obvious by primary school, even if some of them do try to fake being Right. John never bothered. He\u2019s never liked the idea of pretending to be something he isn\u2019t. Not to mention that despite his best efforts, John\u2019s right-handed penmanship has always been comically illegible.\nJohn has never overcompensated, not really. But he graduates top of his class, and he\u2019s offered admission to several med schools. He\u2019s aware that no one else in his family has ever been a doctor. And he\u2019s good at it. Very good. Which is fine.\nThings are supposed to be better for Lefties, now, anyway. Outreach, a government program that once placed Lefties in low-paying jobs -- with the implication that Lefties couldn\u2019t get better ones -- has been largely defunct since John was a child. But a thin veneer of equality doesn\u2019t hide the truth John absorbs in med school: his career path will not follow the straightforward trajectory of his right-handed classmates. No use pretending it will.\nInstead, the Army comes calling, as John knew they would. The Army has always been an unspoken refuge for Lefties -- never mind the whispers that Lefties are more heavily recruited because they\u2019re seen as slightly more expendable citizens. John doesn\u2019t care. It\u2019s in the Army that John finally finds a group of peers, fellow Lefties who don\u2019t care what hand John uses to pick up his fork. His unit flourishes, turns out to be the best of the best. John is oddly comfortable when he\u2019s deployed, far from home in the sweltering, dangerous desert heat. He learns to shoot, and just for a flicker of time, he wonders if he does have a knack after all. Because he turns out to be a damn good shot. A crack shot, in fact.\nBut it\u2019s not a knack, in the end. The Army gives him a few standard tests; he even talks to a specialist. He\u2019s naturally gifted, yes, but it\u2019s nothing that registers on the knack spectrum in any official sense.\nHe shoots left, of course. But it\u2019s okay.\n* * *\nThe bullet that sends John home from Afghanistan tears through his shoulder from an incomprehensible distance.\nJohn remembers peering out of the bunker, wondering if a sniper could reach them from some invisible point across the vast desert plain. They\u2019re on the move now, aware of threats in the surrounding area, but there\u2019s no one within range; it\u2019s been deemed safe to move across the sand. John remembers the prickle on the back of his neck as he shrugged on his pack that day. He remembers the sand under his boots and the scent of sweat and gasoline and metal.\nHe remembers a creeping feeling under his scalp, a sharp tickle at the back of his throat, and the way his imagination flashed images of guns and sights and bullet casings. He had to stop and cough; he was the last out of the bunker. And then: John\u2019s vision blurring into red streaks, an echoing crack across the open plain. His knees hitting sand. His scalp, still prickling as everything tunnelled into a dwindling point of darkness.\nThey never got the sniper. Half the unit died that day.\nJohn might have made it back to serve in some capacity if it hadn\u2019t been for the infection. He is helicoptered to a hospital, and most of an entire month is a blur of white beds and mumbling faces and nightmarish shadows of the attack replaying itself in John\u2019s mind. John slips in and out of the blur, shoulder throbbing, knowing with a doctor\u2019s certainty that his own body is shutting down.\nHe remembers a voice, a particular doctor in the hospital. He doesn\u2019t know the doctor\u2019s name, but he can tell she\u2019s a good doctor, like John. A very good doctor. After her voice drifts into his nightmares, things get a bit better. The blur starts to shift into focus, and one day he notices the frayed edges of a blanket on his hospital cot, a swathe of bandages around his still-sore shoulder, and John knows where he is.\nBut he\u2019s terribly weak. He\u2019s fought off some sort of dysentery on top of an infected bullet wound, and he\u2019s lost nearly two stone. His hands have started shaking.\nThen the limp sets in.\n\u201cPsychosomatic; no actual physical damage. This happens sometimes after traumatic incidents, and you\u2019ve seen plenty of trauma, Doctor,\u201d the GP explains, and although her smile is polished and cheery, the apologetic crease in her brow tells John all he needs to know. PTSD. Possible mental instability. Even if he recovers from the bullet wound, his time in the Army is over.\nThey send him back to England.\n\u00a0\n* * *\n\n chapter one \n\n\n* * *\n\n\u201cHarry. I can\u2019t stay with you.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s tired of this argument, but that\u2019s not going to stop his sister from starting it again, apparently.\n\u201cJohn, I won\u2019t have it. You\u2019re all alone in that ghastly bedsit, you can hardly walk. Why don\u2019t you kip on my couch? I\u2019ll take you out, introduce you around. I can set you up with someone, I know\u00a0loads\u00a0of lovely girls. You shouldn\u2019t be sitting around by yourself, in your state --\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t be your excuse for firing up that knack of yours. Clara\u2019s at her wits\u2019 end, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\u201cClara --\u201d Harry\u2019s voice falters.\n\u201cHarry.\u201d John sighs. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you done?\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t want me to use it, John, and you know that\u2019s not right. It\u2019s who I am --\u201d\n\u201cSo you can find parties. Fantastic. Crash a bloody garden party. Or a six-year-old\u2019s princess tea, for God\u2019s sake. You don\u2019t have to use your knack to stay out all hours every night until you can\u2019t remember your own bloody name. Clara\u00a0loves you, Harry, you can\u2019t treat her as if --\u201d\n\u201cJohn, look. I don\u2019t expect you to understand, right? The way you are. I mean --\u201d\nJohn\u2019s stomach twists. He feels cold. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t expect I do understand,\u201d and hangs up the phone.\n* * *\nSome nights John wakes up from the nightmares and isn\u2019t sure if waking up is worthwhile.\nWhen he can\u2019t sleep, he cleans his gun.\n* * *\nJohn takes a long walk around London each morning. An hour, sometimes two.\nWhen Harry bothers him about his empty days, he tells her he walks because he needs fresh air, because his leg could use the exercise. He doesn\u2019t tell her about the quiet desperation that drives him out of the bedsit, away from the soothing finality of his Sig. She doesn\u2019t need another reason to worry, honestly; the situation with Clara is enough on its own, and Harry\u2019s method of handling stress has always involved an empty bottle.\nSometimes John walks all day, the faces and buses and taxis swirling into a blur as his steps hitch awkwardly against the pavement. It\u2019s no more real than the nightmares that rip his breath to shreds, all part of the same haze, a strange boundless purgatory. Half-asleep, half-awake, fingers wrapped around a gun or a cane. One and the same.\nWhich is why Mike Stamford\u2019s cheerful shout of recognition startles John as if he\u2019s waking up from a deep sleep.\n\u201cJohn. John Watson!\u201d\nThey sit side by side on a park bench some time later, sipping hot coffee that soothes John\u2019s raw throat and sharpens the world back into something resembling reality.\nMike is warm, grounding, solid, much as he always has been. Naturally, now he has a wife and kids and a steady job at Barts. Right-handed like most everyone else, although John\u2019s never known him well enough to ask about his knack. It doesn\u2019t matter much. Next to Mike, John feels like a shell, a hollow alien being stranded on a distant satellite.\n\u201cI\u2019d ask you to dinner, but we\u2019re going to a wedding reception later,\u201d Mike says. \u201cWish we didn\u2019t have to, but I introduced the bride and groom, so... obligation, really. Students of mine.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s fine. This is great. It\u2019s nice to see you again.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I bumped into you, John. Let\u2019s do this again sometime? Go for coffee, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019d be good.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a heavy pause while Mike sips his drink. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in town for a while? Just staying around until you get yourself sorted?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t afford London on an army pension.\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you get a flatshare, or something?\u201d\nJohn shakes his head, gives Mike a wry look. \u201cCome on. Who\u2019d want me for a flatmate?\u201d\nMike's eyes glint, and John gives an unsure smile; and then John\u2019s shoulder twinges, hard, as if to echo his thoughts. He winces, shifts uncomfortably on the bench, but Mike is chuckling, almost as if John isn\u2019t there at all.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the second person to say that to me today,\u201d he says distantly, and John blinks.\n* * *\nThe lab at Barts is ordinary, much the same as John remembers, but the man inside is not ordinary. He is the equivalent of a bullet tearing through flesh, and John would know.\nMike smiled quite contentedly through their brief meeting, as if everything was perfectly normal. But the air in the lab felt heavy, metallic with magnetic charge, and John felt his life ripping, tearing away into questions, shaping itself around the possibility of this new person.\nSherlock Holmes, apparently.\nThe man had stared at John and calmly recited all the relevant facts of John's existence: the war, the limp, his left hand -- point being, he'd looked at John and instantly known\u00a0everything. His piercing blue eyes had locked with John's, and John had felt something strange prickle up his spine, a jolt of adrenaline, pure electric nerve. Like staring into the scope of a rifle: impossible to look away.\nAnd they're looking at a flat tomorrow. A bloody flatshare with this man. John, ordinary, left-handed John, sharing a flat with a man who is either a mad genius, or has an outrageous knack, or both.\nSherlock Holmes is so unusual, so spectacular, that as John shakes Mike\u2019s hand at the front door of Barts, he can't stop the question before it tumbles clumsily out of his mouth.\n\"Is that his knack, then?\"\nMike raises his eyebrows, and his dimples deepen.\n\"I didn't mean -- \" John says hastily, but Mike holds up a hand.\n\"Understandable,\" he says. \"And I don't pretend to know Sherlock very well, but anyone who meets him knows what he can do. Yes, I'm sure it's a knack of some kind, although I'm not sure how it's officially categorized. He's not any sort of Analyst, that much I can tell you. He gets all of that just by looking at a person. Observation only.\"\n\"And you think someone like that would want to share a flat with me.\"\nMike shrugs, still grinning. Christ, he hasn't stopped smiling the entire time they've been at Barts. It's slightly unsettling.\n\"He didn't seem opposed to the idea, did he?\"\n\"I guess not. God.\" John rubs the back of his neck. \"Well, thanks, Mike, really. Above and beyond the call of duty.\"\n\"Don't mention it,\" Mike says, giving a wave as he turns back toward the hospital. \"Email me, right? Let me know if it works out.\"\n\"Yeah,\" John says, his mind drawn inexorably to the man who'd blotted out the dull fog of the morning with his dark wool coat, the man who'd left his riding crop in the mortuary. \"Yeah, will do.\"\n* * *\n221b Baker Street feels like home to John before he even gets halfway up the stairs. It's like his entire life has warped into one big foregone conclusion in less than twenty steps. Of course he's moving in; it's cozy and messy and warm and absolutely everything his bedsit isn't, and, most importantly, it's got Sherlock Holmes in it.\nJohn can only sit in the surprisingly comfortable armchair in 221b and watch as Sherlock throws off energy in waves, pulling at John like the tide. He seems more alive than any other person John's ever met, every last molecule charged with purpose.\nSo when he asks John to go with him -- actually\u00a0go with him\u00a0somewhere, John has no idea where, but it has to do with a murder, of all things -- there's no way John is refusing. No way John could ever refuse. In the back of the taxi, John feels light, nearly drunk with the sheer rush of Sherlock next to him. With the sheer improbability of it all.\nHe's known this man all of twenty minutes, in total.\nThe sun dips down between the rough stone and glass spikes of London buildings as they sit in silence in the cab, Sherlock soaked in shadow, all dark curls and coat.\n\"In the lab, you said Afghanistan or Iraq,\" John says at last.\n\"Obvious,\" Sherlock's answer is cool, but quick, as if he's been waiting for John to speak. \"Your haircut, the way you hold yourself. You're left-handed. A large percentage of Lefties are either drawn to military service or recruited straight out of school.\" Then, a list of rapid-fire details: tan lines, the limp (psychosomatic, complete with therapist,\u00a0of course). John feels his jaw go slack with the intimate assault of information.\n\"You have questions,\" Sherlock says, eyes glinting blue in the fading daylight.\nJohn is too genuinely stunned to be anything other than direct. \"This is your knack, I take it. But what is it, exactly? How is it categorized?\"\nSherlock's mouth quirks. He doesn't seem offended. \"Considering I knew your knack status from a moment\u2019s observation, it seems only fair that you should know mine.\" His eyes flick, once, to John's left hand. \"My knack is difficult to explain. The closest way to describe it would be... deduction. The ability to draw conclusions, to connect the dots between disparate bits of information. But it doesn't all come easily. I have to work at it. To observe.\" He looks out the window. \"And it's... not categorized.\"\n\"Not categorized.\" John swallows. This is almost unheard of.\n\"Believed to be unique, yes.\" Sherlock turns back, regards John with a measured look. \"Problem?\"\nJohn realizes he's been staring. He exhales quickly, shakes his head. \"No. No problem. It was just -- that was brilliant. Amazing.\"\nSherlock's eyes glow, corners crinkling. \"You think so.\"\n\"Yeah. I mean, can you -- could you do a bit more?\"\nThis earns John a genuine, shy grin. John is baffled. It's almost as if Sherlock is rarely praised for this extraordinary ability. Impossible.\n\"Your brother,\" Sherlock says. \"Your brother has a drinking problem. Look -- give me your phone.\"\n* * *\nIt comes as no surprise to John that Sherlock abandons him at the crime scene.\nIt makes more sense, honestly, than Sherlock inviting him there in the first place. It seems perfectly reasonable that a man capable of deducing a woman's adultery habit from the state of her jewellery should realize that he's brought an entirely useless third party to a classified Scotland Yard location.\nJohn limps down the endless staircases in the abandoned house feeling invisible. Members of DI Lestrade's team shrug past him with equipment and cameras as John's cane thumps against the creaky floorboards. Back to the bedsit; wait to hear from Sherlock, perhaps, although John's not counting on it. Perhaps this was a test of some kind, to see if John could be useful in Sherlock's line of work? John can't imagine he passed, unless offering a single obvious observation and a handful of glowing compliments qualified as usefulness.\nAll things considered, though, the day was a brilliant distraction from John's usual routine. The reality of the drab bedsit starts to encroach on John's thoughts, the memory of dull beige carpet starting to erode the bright hour spent in Sherlock's company. It was too good to be true, really. And if he'd let himself get a bit carried away with the fantasy of living with Sherlock -- well, that was the only damage done. Alone, at the end of it: utterly unsurprising.\nThe ringing phones, the security cameras, the black Jaguar that slides to a halt to pick him up -- all of\u00a0that\u00a0is a surprise.\nThe man standing alone on the slick, glossy floor of the warehouse is leaning on an umbrella; he regards John with an oily stare. John's neck prickles in suspicion as this odd, dapper penguin of a man gives him a searching look that feels almost as if John is being X-rayed.\nJohn's left hand clenches, unclenches. He waits for the man to speak.\n\"Dr John Watson,\" the man says, syllables dripping with polish. \"Interesting.\"\n\"Not really, no,\" John says, squaring his shoulders. \"If you think so, you've probably got the wrong man.\"\nUmbrella Suit raises an eyebrow. \"I never get the wrong man,\" he says smoothly. \"What can you tell me about Sherlock Holmes?\"\n\"Almost nothing. Met him yesterday. He invited me to look at a flatshare.\"\n\"And you\u2019ll take it, I assume.\"\n\"How is this any of your business?\"\n\"Everything about Sherlock Holmes is my business, Dr Watson. And now, it seems you fall under that category.\"\nJohn lifts his chin, looks this man in the eye. \"What is it you want from me, exactly?\"\n\"You may have already gathered this, Doctor, but Sherlock Holmes has no friends. And yet... after meeting him yesterday, you're moving in with him, and now you're solving crimes together. Curious.\"\n\"How do you know I'll be moving in with him?\"\nThe man gives John another long, studied look, sweeping from John's worn oxfords to his close-cropped haircut. It's more than slightly unnerving. John waits, eyes fixed straight ahead, and says nothing.\nUmbrella Suit, brow furrowed, seems to be satisfied with whatever his gaze has revealed. He smiles placidly. \"I imagine people have already warned you to stay away from him, but I can see from your left hand that's not going to happen.\"\nJohn swallows against a surge of biting anger. He grips his cane tightly. \"Bit rude, don't you think?\"\nAnother simpering smile. \"Apologies. I was not referring to your left-handed status, merely that you have a tremor in your left hand. Your therapist noted it too.\" He holds up a familiar bound notebook that John has only seen in his therapist's hands. During their private appointments. Jesus. John feels his entire body go rigid.\n\u201cHold out your left hand, please.\u201d\n\"Who the hell are you?\"\n\"Your left hand, please, Dr Watson.\"\nJohn's phone chirps once, in his pocket.\nJohn Watson holds out his left hand, the hand he tries not to resent. Right now, he thinks, if he were right-handed, he might have some sort of defence against this man. Some sort of spectacular trick. In another life, he might have been like Sherlock; he would stand here and take this man apart with the power of his mind. But he's got nothing.\nHis hand is perfectly steady.\nThe text is from Sherlock Holmes.\n* * *\nSherlock claims he likes company when he goes out, which is interesting, really, for someone who says he doesn't have friends. He does like to talk to the skull on the mantelpiece. John figures he can fill that role without much effort.\nIn the course of standing in for Sherlock's skull, John abandons his cane to chase a cab through London's back alleys, moves into 221b, and kills a man.\nIt's been a while since John has killed anyone, but the decision takes shockingly little thought on John's part. There is only one impulse: Sherlock is about to die. Every fiber of John's consciousness flares into focus, soldier reflexes humming high in his veins as his vision narrows to a single point. It's a good shot. It's actually a breathtaking shot, a fatal hit through two separate panes of glass, but John doesn't stick around to see the results. He knows as soon as the cabbie crumples, and he's gone before Sherlock can turn around.\nAs his feet echo through the slick, empty hallways he hears his heart pound and feels his legs work,\u00a0both\u00a0legs, his body tuned to its familiar military frequency. No pain, no limp, just a clear head and the zing of adrenaline and the comfortable grip of a gun in his hand. His left --\nNo. His right. His gun is in his\u00a0right\u00a0hand.\nJohn skids to a halt outside a toilet and tries the door; it's open. He flicks on the lights, which buzz an uneven undertone as he stares at his reflection in the mirror.\nHe stares back at himself, reflected. He raises each hand. His mirror image has it wrong, anyway. Left is right. Right, left. But he's not wrong: his gun is definitely in his right hand. He must have been in such a hurry to take the shot that he didn't even realize which hand he was shooting with.\nHurriedly, John clicks on the safety and shoves the Sig in the back of his trouser waistband. He washes his hands in the sink under the greenish-yellow institutional lighting and pumps out a generous handful of nauseating pink almond-scented soap. He scrubs, hard, left and right tangled together. Maybe he was mistaken. Maybe it was nerves, PTSD. A particularly vivid hallucination. He flexes his hands under the stream, shuts off the tap, and flicks off the lights.\nHe's been alone for months, days stretching into endless purgatory, a numbing sameness that always ends in nightmares. And then, in the space of a day, he's met Sherlock, gotten tangled in a murder investigation, and shot a man without even thinking about it. Right-handed, no less.\nLeft, right; John doesn\u2019t care. Tonight John would have shot that cabbie with a gun between his teeth if it had been necessary.\nHe jogs downstairs, out the rear door of the empty building. He's alone. He can see reflections of flashing police lights on the uneven bricks of the alleyway; Lestrade's brought his team.\nJohn leans against the wall and catches his breath. He shifts from one leg to another, marvelling that his weight is supported evenly. Nothing gives way.\nHe straightens up, tugs down his jumper, and strolls out between the police cars, thankful for once to be invisible.\n* * *\nUmbrella Suit is Sherlock's brother. Stranger things have happened.\nFor one, Sherlock wants to get dinner. With John.\nThey walk in companionable silence towards Baker Street, Sherlock's tall, dark form a comfortable presence at John's shoulder. As if there has always been a Sherlock-shaped hole next to John that has only just now been filled.\nThe Chinese restaurant is, as advertised, delicious. They've eaten their way through two plates of appetizers and have just started on the wonton soup when Sherlock abruptly puts down his spoon and leans back in his chair, steepling his fingers.\n\"Your sister's drinking,\" he says. \"It's got something to do with her knack.\"\nJohn finds it hard to swallow his bite of wonton. His eyes water with the unexpected gulp of soup. \"Now\u00a0that\u00a0is -- How did you know?\"\n\"When you talked about your sister earlier, in the cab, you kept flexing your left hand. I've noticed that other topics of conversation don't trigger this response, so it's possibly a stress-induced reaction, maybe something that's subconsciously linked to your feelings. Since you're left-handed, a knack issue starts to look likely. So your sister's marriage troubles, caused solely by her drinking habit? Maybe not that simple. Maybe it's somehow linked to a knack, and since you don\u2019t have one, hers is the most likely culprit.\"\nJohn tries hard not to look utterly gobsmacked and fails.\nSherlock studies John's slack-jawed amazement and lifts an eyebrow. \"Am I right?\"\n\"Christ.\" John sits back in his chair. \"Yeah, you are. Bloody amazing.\"\nSherlock's mouth twists. \"You've expressed that sentiment already.\"\n\"Bears repeating. Still no idea how you do that.\"\n\"As with anything, some days it comes more easily than others. Had a hunch just now. I'll admit it was a bit of a shot in the dark.\"\n\"And you said\u00a0I\u00a0was a good shot.\"\nSherlock smiles. He leans forward, chin on folded hands. \"Your sister's knack, though.\"\n\"Oh. Right.\" John sighs. \"Pain in the arse, is what it is. My dad never got lost, could always find his way home, or to wherever he was going. Harry can find places, too. Only she has a talent for finding... parties.\"\n\"Parties?\"\n\"Yeah, social gatherings of any kind, but the better the party, the better Harry is at finding it. Or, the better the party is at finding Harry, more like.\" John shakes his head. \"Wasn't so bad when she was little, except she'd disappear, you know, run off down the road if another kid had a birthday, things like that. She still disappears. Never stopped doing it.\"\n\"Harry grew up, and so did the parties.\"\nJohn sighs. \"Exactly.\"\n\"And she won't stop, is that it? Doesn't want to stop using her knack. Understandable.\"\nJohn feels his jaw clench, and he swallows. \"Not understandable to me, but I guess it wouldn't be.\"\nA weighty pause. \"This is why you won\u2019t stay with her.\"\n\"This is why we've never gotten on, yes. Whenever I visit, she gets even worse. Wants to -- show off, I dunno. She\u2019s never been able to resist rubbing it in, that I\u2019m -- you know.\u201d John gestures faintly with his left hand. \u201cClara got fed up too. About two months ago.\"\nSherlock hums in understanding. They sit in silence broken only by the clink of silverware and glasses in the half-empty restaurant. John prods a wonton with his spoon until he works up his nerve to ask the question burning a hole through the rest of his thoughts.\n\"You're, er -- okay with this. With me. Moving in.\"\n\"Why shouldn't I be? I asked you to.\"\n\"Not -- not exactly,\" John says. \"You told Mrs Hudson I'd take the flat.\"\n\"I was right, though.\"\n\"Yes, but -- I'm not -- I mean. You've got your skull,\" John finishes lamely. \"You hardly know me.\"\n\"You hardly know\u00a0me,\" Sherlock counters.\n\"I don't really need to.\" John stirs his soup. He's not quite sure how to express the difference between an evening with Sherlock and a night alone in his old bedsit. He's not sure he has words to do it.\n\"I think your work on the cabbie's given you a bit of a leg up. The skull has no aim whatsoever.\"\nJohn's eyebrows shoot up, and he looks up at Sherlock. Sherlock is grinning.\nJohn grins back. There\u2019s a long pause.\n\u201cWhat are you so happy about, then?\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s grin widens. \u201cMoriarty.\u201d\nThe waitress puts down a plate of steaming chow mein between them, but it goes unnoticed.\n* * *\nJohn awakens to a loud bang and a faint whiff of sulfur and ozone. It\u2019s been three months since he dragged the sum total of his worldly possessions into 221b, and it says a lot about his current living arrangements that he does not immediately roll into a defensive crouch. Instead, he stares at the ceiling and stretches contentedly, feeling the creaky pop of his joints and listening to the clatters of an experiment likely gone out of control downstairs.\nHe shuffles downstairs in his dressing gown and is greeted by an even stronger smell of sulfur and the sight of his flatmate in safety goggles and enormous rubber gloves. Sherlock barely looks up as John pokes his head into the kitchen.\n\u201cI take it breakfast is out of the question?\u201d\n\u201cBusy,\u201d Sherlock grunts.\n\u201cHow toxic, exactly?\u201d\nA telling silence.\n\u201cRight.\u201d John sighs, settles into his armchair. \u201cFood can wait. It\u2019s not like we need it to survive or anything.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in danger of perishing from malnutrition, there\u2019s a cafe downstairs.\u201d Sherlock lifts up his goggles and peers at him. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t look like that will be a concern anytime soon.\u201d\nJohn flips a two-fingered salute in the direction of the kitchen, leans back, and picks up the newspaper. Out of the corner of his eye, he can see Sherlock\u2019s smirk as he replaces his goggles.\nThere\u2019s a faint noise downstairs, the polite thump of a knock; then a measured, low voice in the stairwell. Their landlady\u2019s familiar call echoes up the stairs.\n\u201cSherlock? Are you up there, love?\u201d And then, to the visitor: \u201cI don\u2019t know, if he\u2019s not answering his phone, Mycroft, he could be out and about --\u201d\nFootsteps. \u201cI\u2019ll let myself in, Mrs Hudson, it\u2019s quite all right.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be up in a minute then, you can wait for him, I\u2019ll make a nice cuppa --\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Mrs Hudson, that would be very kind.\u201d\nThe distinctive form of Mycroft Holmes, umbrella in hand, appears in the doorway of 221b. John raises his eyebrows, makes a move to stand, but Mycroft motions him back to the chair.\n\u201cGood morning, John, good morning. Please sit, I realize the hour is rather early for a formal visit.\u201d He gives Sherlock a pointed look. \u201cI do hope I\u2019m not interrupting anything.\u201d\nSherlock peers at the particularly vile-looking yellow liquid in his beaker, switches off the flame underneath it, and pushes up his goggles. \u201cMycroft, your mere existence is a perpetual interruption. Right now is no different.\u201d\n\u201cMy apologies.\u201d Mycroft settles into Sherlock\u2019s chair and earns a petulant look from the chair\u2019s usual occupant. \u201cJohn, all is well, I hope? How are you finding living with my brother? Hellish, I imagine.\u201d\nJohn folds the paper, gives a thin smile. Mycroft, despite his impeccable manners -- or perhaps because of them -- excels at creating an atmosphere of refined unease. \u201cI\u2019m never bored,\u201d John says shortly.\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d Mycroft gives John a rather wan smile. \u201cThat blog of yours, it\u2019s creating quite a stir, isn\u2019t it? Drumming up quite a bit of business. Sherlock has never experienced such success at his chosen line of work.\u201d\nSherlock peels off his gloves, glaring unreservedly at Mycroft. John clears his throat. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a good thing, I hope.\u201d\n\u201cQuite remarkable,\u201d Mycroft says, and there\u2019s that piercing gaze again, even more hawklike than Sherlock\u2019s, if such a thing is possible. John shifts uncomfortably in his chair, feels a pinch somewhere near his scar.\n\u201cThe only thing remarkable about John\u2019s blog is the fact that people read it,\u201d Sherlock says dryly, before John can reply.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be childish, Sherlock. I was merely taking an interest.\u201d Mycroft graces John with another simpering smile. \u201cIt is quite remarkable, what John has accomplished. Do I understand that you\u2019ve started practising medicine again, when you\u2019re not chasing after my brother?\u201d\nJohn opens his mouth to answer, but Sherlock cuts him off once again. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re implying, Mycroft.\u201d He paces toward the window and opens his violin case. \u201cDo spit out the reason you\u2019ve come and save us your little pats on the head.\u201d\nMycroft raises his eyebrows. \u201cCharming, Sherlock. Very well.\u201d He reaches into the pocket of his lush tweed suit jacket and draws out a single envelope. \u201cAndrew West. Civil servant. Found dead on the tracks near Battersea Station this morning. Apparent suicide.\u201d\nSherlock lifts his violin under his chin and plucks the strings slightly louder than is necessary to check the tuning. Mycroft sighs.\nJohn clears his throat. \u201cWhy should the government care about a suicide?\u201d\n\u201cWe have reason to suspect foul play. Mr West was in possession of a rather sensitive piece of government information, which unfortunately was stored on a flash drive.The drive is now missing.\u201d\n\u201cTypical.\u201d Sherlock raises his bow and plays three quick, mocking notes, watching Mycroft. \u201cAnd why can\u2019t your own toadies clean up the mess? -- Ah. Suspect an inside job, do you?\u201d\nMycroft shifts in Sherlock\u2019s armchair, stands up. \u201cYour attention to this matter would be most appreciated, Sherlock. It is a matter of... national importance.\u201d\nSherlock raises an eyebrow. \u201cI do so love it when you beg.\u201d He turns to the window, violin still under his chin. \u201cBut no. Terribly busy at the moment, thanks to my remarkable blogger.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Mycroft has fixed John in his gaze again; he proffers the envelope in John\u2019s direction. \u201cWell, perhaps you could find room for this when your schedule... clears up a bit. Think it over.\u201d\n\u201cHow very predictable of you. Thank you for your interference, Mycroft, so kind of you to meddle this morning.\u201d The violin soars upward in volume and quite plainly dismisses Mycroft with a sweeping, venomous trill of notes.\nMycroft tuts and gives John a short bow. \u201cA pleasure, John, as always.\u201d\nJohn stands, stiffly, and shakes his hand. \u201cSee you later, Mycroft.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, dears, I was just getting some scones out of the oven.\u201d Mrs Hudson has appeared in the doorway of the flat, balancing a plate of something that smells good enough to clash terribly with the chemical smell of the kitchen. \u201cLeaving already? I was going to make that cuppa --\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t trouble yourself, Mrs Hudson.\u201d Mycroft picks up his umbrella, addresses her with another short bow. \u201cAnother time, I\u2019m sure. Good day to you.\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d Mrs Hudson looks faintly flustered. \u201cI\u2019ll just --\u201d\n\u201cTea would be lovely,\u201d John says, smiling at her as Mycroft\u2019s careful footfalls echo down the stairs.\nMrs Hudson gives John a gratified smile in return and bustles into the kitchen, muttering under her breath. John can hear \u201cterrible mess\u201d and \u201cfrightful\u201d before all of it is drowned by the sound of running water.\nSherlock puts his violin back into its case and calls out over the noise. \u201cCareful, Mrs Hudson. The second beaker to the left of the range is slightly unstable.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cWhat, it might tip over?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not, John, I mean it might explode.\u201d\n\u201cQuite all right, dear,\u201d Mrs Hudson calls.\nJohn sighs. \u201cI think the flat could be on fire and Mrs Hudson would still stop to put the kettle on.\u201d\nThis earns a long, low chuckle from Sherlock. He settles into the armchair across from John with an approving look. John feels a curl of warmth twist in his chest.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re more right than you know.\u201d Sherlock glances toward the kitchen. \u201cYou happen to have hit upon the very thing that\u2019s unusual about Mrs Hudson. If you\u2019ve deduced it deliberately, I\u2019ll be quite impressed.\u201d\nJohn gives a wry smile. \u201cNope. No idea what you\u2019re talking about, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\u201cMrs Hudson\u2019s knack.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, tea?\u201d\n\u201cComing, boys!\u201d Mrs Hudson is balancing a battered silver tray with mugs and scones, which she slides neatly onto the table behind Sherlock. \u201cThe scones are ginger and cardamom. Can\u2019t stay, I\u2019ve got an errand at the chemist\u2019s. But I did promise Mycroft the tea earlier. So just this once.\u201d She hands John his RAMC mug, which is steaming hot.\nPrecisely the right temperature, in fact. Which shouldn\u2019t be possible, considering the kettle clicked off only seconds ago.\n\u201cThanks, Mrs H.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Sherlock adds. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mycroft disturbed you so early.\u201d\n\u201cNot a bother.\u201d Mrs Hudson is still talking over her shoulder as she makes her way down the stairs. \u201cI can\u2019t bring you tea every morning, mind, but you did have a guest, and your kitchen, Sherlock. Really. You can\u2019t be having people over with the flat in such a state.\u201d\n\u201cThanks again, Mrs Hudson,\u201d John calls.\nSherlock takes a sip from his mug, and watches as John takes a sip from his own.\n\u201cNow think about it,\u201d Sherlock says. \u201cThis tea.\u201d\nJohn takes a deep swig, expecting to be scalded, but the tea is pleasantly rather than uncomfortably hot at the back of his throat. It\u2019s been steeped just the right amount: strong, but not bitter, with enough milk to turn it a golden caramel color, and enough natural flavor that it needs no sweetener at all.\nIt\u2019s fairly marvellous, in fact.\n\u201cIt\u2019s... perfect,\u201d he says, and takes another sip. \u201cBut Mrs Hudson always makes a very good cup of tea.\u201d\n\u201cMrs Hudson,\u201d Sherlock intones, his long fingers wrapped around his own mug, \u201cmakes the perfect cup of tea.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d\n\u201cYes, in an official, categorized capacity,\u201d Sherlock says. \u201cMycroft knows it, too, which is why I was particularly glad to send him on his way this morning before he got any.\u201d\nJohn shakes his head, takes another sip. It really is delicious. They sit and sip tea in comfortable silence for several long moments.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lovely knack to have,\u201d John says eventually.\n\u201cYes. Rather suits her, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\nSilence falls again, a rare moment of calm.\nJohn tries to sort through several conflicting bits of information regarding their current caseload. He can\u2019t do it.\n\u201cYou told Mycroft we were busy, Sherlock.\u201d\n\u201cAmong other things, yes.\u201d\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t have a case.\u201d\n\u201cAlso true. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re available.\u201d\nJohn lets out a frustrated breath. \u201cI don\u2019t understand this petty feud business, Sherlock. Really.\u201d\n\u201cWords clearly spoken by one who didn\u2019t grow up with Mycroft Holmes.\u201d\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t have a case. We can help, Sherlock. National importance, for God\u2019s sake. Why wouldn\u2019t you --\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you refuse to speak up when someone patronises you,\u201d Sherlock interrupts. \u201cIt\u2019s tremendously irritating.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d John\u2019s voice goes up half an octave in surprise. \u201cWhat are you on about? What does that have to do with anything?\u201d\n\u201cMy brother finds you so remarkable,\u201d Sherlock says bitterly. \u201cOne would think that with his occupation he would be able to see his prejudice for what it is.\u201d\nJohn feels his shoulders tense; he exhales. \u201cSherlock, I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m talking about taking a really important case when you\u2019re crawling the walls out of boredom.\u201d\n\u201cMycroft treats you as if you\u2019re some sort of charity case, and you do nothing to correct him,\u201d Sherlock says, each syllable steeped in resentment. \u201cWhy would I help someone who maintains the outdated and incorrect assumption that left-handed individuals are inferior?\u201d\nThis hits a nerve, a nerve John didn\u2019t know was raw until now. His jaw clenches reflexively, and it takes great effort to set down his tea without spilling it. \u201cIf I took five minutes to correct everyone who patronises me because I\u2019m left-handed, Sherlock, I\u2019d be doing nothing else for the next twenty years.\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s eyebrows lift, his eyes as pale as the china cup in his hand.\n\u201cI\u2019m going out,\u201d John says, standing up abruptly, and in his mind he can only see Mycroft\u2019s simpering smile, no different than all the other condescending smiles. Sherlock has no idea, can\u2019t possibly know what it\u2019s like to become so accustomed to pity that it barely registers.\n\u201cJohn --\u201d\n\u201cSave it,\u201d John snaps, jacket in hand. Before Sherlock can say anything else John is down the stairs and out the door of 221b, his heart pounding sickeningly high in his throat.\n* * *\nJohn is staring across the boating lake at Regent\u2019s Park when his phone vibrates in his jacket.Client. Baker Street. Come at once. SH\nTaking a walk. Back later.\nNeed you for this one. SH\nNo, you don\u2019t.\n221b. SH\nJohn scowls at the phone in his hand and briefly considers flinging it into the lake. Instead he takes a cold, stinging breath. The air has a wintry bite, and he didn\u2019t bring the right jacket. He slips the phone back into his pocket.\nHe doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s so angry, and that\u2019s part of the reason he\u2019s angry. It\u2019s a lovely little paradox, one he\u2019s not particularly in the mood to solve.\nHe shifts from foot to foot in an effort not to shiver. These things shouldn\u2019t get to him anymore. And they usually don\u2019t. A lifetime of condescension doled out in veiled compliments like Mycroft\u2019s has made John fairly numb to clumsy displays of prejudice. This is nothing different, nothing new: another grain of sand in what is already a vast desert.\nJohn jams his hands into the pockets of his jeans. The idea that Sherlock thinks John needs defending is nauseating. Sherlock has no idea what it\u2019s like to fight these little wars every day. It\u2019s like Sisyphus and the boulder: no bloody reason to climb the hill.\nSherlock is wrong. Sherlock is infuriating.\nSherlock needs John back at Baker Street, however.\nIt\u2019s too cold to stay outside much longer. At least that\u2019s what John tells himself.\n* * *\nThe man sitting on the couch in the living room has the reddest hair John\u2019s ever seen in his life. He looks to be in his early thirties, roughly John\u2019s height, but considerably heavier. He\u2019s wearing a thick-rimmed black glasses, a checked button-down and jeans, and stands up to hold out his hand in greeting as John enters.\n\u201cJames Wilson,\u201d he says brightly. \u201cCall me Jabez, it\u2019s my Twitter handle. Big fan of your blog, mate. Hoping to engage the services of Mr Holmes regarding a strange situation.\u201d\nSherlock gestures to John\u2019s empty chair by the fireplace. His eyes flick to John\u2019s briefly, and John can see a silent request. John isn\u2019t sure when he and Sherlock started having entirely unspoken conversations, but this doesn\u2019t feel like the first. Heat rises in John\u2019s cheeks, and he gives a slight nod.\nThe corner of Sherlock\u2019s mouth twitches upward in acknowledgement.\n\u201cEr-- yes, nice to meet you,\u201d John says, taking the man\u2019s hand and shaking it. Jabez Wilson has a firm handshake, but his eyes dart insecurely around the room.\n\u201cDo please continue, Jabez,\u201d Sherlock says as John settles into his armchair and picks up his notepad from the end table. \u201cJabez was just telling me about his online resale business.\u201d\n\u201cOnline resale?\u201d\n\u201cJabezbiz-dot-CO-dot-UK.\u201d\nJohn has scrawled the date on a fresh sheet of paper and is making a note of the URL when he realizes their potential client has fallen silent. He looks up.\nJabez Wilson is staring at John\u2019s hand, the one holding the pen.\n\u201cProblem?\u201d Sherlock says icily.\n\u201cNo, I -- sorry, Dr Watson, I didn\u2019t realize -- I mean, I\u2019d assumed --\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d John interrupts, before Sherlock has a chance to get in a word. \u201cYour company, Jabez.\u201d\nJabez looks at John again with poorly concealed curiosity before turning to Sherlock. \u201cRight, okay. Let\u2019s say you have something you want to sell on eBay, but you don\u2019t want to bother with the trouble of actually setting up the auction.\u201d Jabez leans forward, gives a practised smile; clearly this is a rehearsed business pitch. \u201cYou bring it to us and we\u2019ll do the work for you, figure out the pricing, list it, ship it, everything, for a small percentage of the profit.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018We,\u2019\u201dJohn echoes. \u201cHow big is your company?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just me and another bloke at the moment. Brilliant guy. Lucky to have found him. Set up our website for a real steal. I\u2019m sure he could help you out with yours, if you ever need --\u201d Wilson is fishing in his pockets, clearly looking for something, and pulls out a creased business card.\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s quite all right,\u201d John says. \u201cI\u2019m not one for a slick website, really.\u201d\n\u201cClearly,\u201d Sherlock says under his breath, and then, holding out his hand: \u201cI\u2019ll take that.\u201d Jabez leans forward and hands Sherlock the card, which Sherlock examines with deft fingers before pocketing it. Jabez is still chatting animatedly.\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re looking for something with more modern edge for your site, a few more interactive features, Mr Holmes? Could really drive up your hits. Victor\u2019s a genius with CSS.\u201d\n\u201cVictor...\u201d\n\u201cSpaulding,\u201d Jabez finishes. \u201cMy CTO. And he can work up a bit of Flash for you, as well --\u201d\n\u201cMr Wilson, I despise advertisements,\u201d Sherlock says abruptly. \u201cIf you think I want one performed in the living room of my flat you\u2019re an idiot. Leave now.\u201d\nJabez flushes a colour that nearly matches his brilliant hair.\nJohn shifts in his seat. \u201cSherlock --\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Sherlock snaps, waving a hand. \u201cContinue. Quickly, before I change my mind.\u201d\nJabez swallows hard, the colour on his face blotchy and bright. \u201cR-right. Okay. Well, Victor forwarded me an email about a company looking for data entry workers. Strictly part-time. Thing is, they only wanted people with red hair to apply. Minimal hours, amazing pay.\u201d\n\u201cThat is strange, but the Internet is a strange place,\u201d Sherlock says. \u201cAt least, given the evidence on John\u2019s laptop.\u201d\nJohn frowns.\n\u201cI figured it was one of those fake email schemes -- you know, like those ones that say you\u2019ve won a million pounds from Uganda -- but Victor checked it out, said it looked legit, so I went to the interview. Whole room of applicants, all redheads. Weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. And then they hired me.\u201d\n\u201cStill failing to see the problem here.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I worked there for eight weeks straight, and then yesterday I showed up and no one was in the office. Door locked. I asked around and no one had any record of the company ever renting the offices at all. It\u2019s like they never existed. But I was there, I swear, for eight weeks, four hours a day. I got paid. I just want my job back, Mr Holmes, or at least an explanation. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what was the name of this supposed organization?\u201d\n\u201cRHL Incorporated. Stands for Registrar of Home Locations or some such thing. I had to enter addresses into their database alphabetically. Bloody tedious, but... I really need a bit of supplemental income. Just until the resale company gets on its feet.\u201d\n\u201cIt is tedious,\u201d Sherlock intones, glancing at John, and their eyes meet. John shifts in his seat. And then Sherlock\u2019s eyes widen, and he sits up suddenly, his entire body in singular, startling focus.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take the case. Thank you for bringing this to our attention, Jabez.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d John says in disbelief.\nJabez is already standing, shaking Sherlock\u2019s hand. \u201cWow, thanks, Mr Holmes. I really appreciate --\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d Sherlock says shortly, and Jabez takes this as a cue to scurry out the door with a slightly disgruntled look at John on the way.\nJohn waits until he hears the front door of 221b slam shut before he stabs an emphatic finger in the direction of the doorway.\n\u201cSeriously, Sherlock. Seriously? You took that case, which boils down to the idiot victim of some worthless internet scam, but you won\u2019t help your own brother, who wants you to track down top secret government files?\u201d\nSherlock steeples his fingers under his chin. He says nothing.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re doing this to prove a point -- if it\u2019s about my hand, and what I can\u2019t do -- or what I can do -- I don\u2019t want any part of it.\u201d John\u2019s voice is brittle enough that it cracks. \u201cI don\u2019t care what your brother thinks, and I sure as hell don\u2019t care if some idiotic client makes a face when I pick up my pen.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d Sherlock says.\n\u201cI\u2019m wrong.\u201d John chuckles. \u201cOne minute you\u2019re berating your brother for his attitude, next minute you\u2019re taking a worthless case because the client looked at my hand. New champion for the cause, are you? Should I print up a bloody poster and parade in front of the flat? \u2018No Case Left Unsolved?\u2019 \u2018Your Case Left In Good Hands?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing this to prove a point.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re always trying to prove your point.\u201d\nSherlock leans forward, eyes laser-sharp. \u201cJabez Wilson handed me his colleague\u2019s business card.\u201d He takes it out of his jacket, holds it up. \u201cVictor Spaulding, CTO of Livid Group Web Design. Card stock is foreign, cheap, the fibre is typical of U.S. manufacturers -- and this card is too cheap to be worth the price of overseas shipping, so clearly, the person who had it printed was in the U.S. at the time. Newish card, made within the past few months, so most likely its owner just got back from the States. This Victor can\u2019t have been working with Jabez very long, a month at best.\u201d He pauses. \u201cTwo years ago I was tracking the whereabouts of a notorious hacker known online as \u2018Scant.\u2019 Responsible for hacking into several credit card databases-- then vanished, proved impossible to trace. Rumoured to have left the country. Haven\u2019t heard anything from him in quite some time.\u201d\nJohn stares. \u201cI have absolutely no idea what you\u2019re driving at.\u201d\n\u201cAdd the word \u2018Scant\u2019 to the company name -- \u2018Livid Group\u2019 -- and it comes out quite nicely as an anagram for \u2018Victor Spaulding.\u2019 Given the strange circumstances described by Jabez Wilson, it would seem that Scant is once again hard at work.\u201d\nJohn blows out a long, shaky breath. \u201cJesus, Sherlock.\u201d\nSherlock stands up, flips open his laptop. \u201cI need to get in touch with my online contacts for the original case. I\u2019ll need you to start researching Livid Group Web Design. And find out anything you can about RHL Incorporated.\u201d\nJohn feels pressure building in his head, as if there is simply too much to physically process. He presses his fingers to his temples.\nOf course Sherlock wouldn\u2019t care; of course he\u2019s only thinking about the case itself. Sherlock, despite the maddening opacity of his unparalleled brain, can sometimes be perfectly transparent.\nJohn looks up; Sherlock is now typing away on the laptop, eyes scanning the screen. \u201cThat was amazing,\u201d John says quietly. \u201cUnbelievable, even for you.\u201d\nA faint twitch of a smile. \u201cI know,\u201d Sherlock murmurs.\nTheir eyes meet, and for a brief flash John can see an acknowledgement, the barest hint that despite the all-consuming rush of a case, Sherlock knows exactly what John is thinking. Acceptance, the simple thing that has always flowed between them. It\u2019s all fine.\nJohn shakes his head in disbelief, gives a weak smile in return.\n\u201cWell, do you want to help, or not?\u201d Sherlock says, still looking at John, and the air is charged between them, that familiar wordless connection lit up like a Christmas tree, because what Sherlock means is Don\u2019t be stupid, I need you.\nIt\u2019s all John ever needs to hear.\n* * *\nIt takes Sherlock 39 hours, five nicotine patches, and the assistance of an unseen hacker named \u201cJones\u201d to unravel Victor Spaulding\u2019s plot to hack into the Bank of England and embezzle an obscene amount of money.\nNeither of them sleep for a single one of those 39 hours.\nAt two in the morning, on the thirty-ninth hour, Sherlock is still infuriatingly functional. He hovers on the edge of the couch tapping away on his laptop, unshowered and wrapped in a dressing gown, dark curls bearing recent evidence of having been raked upwards in frustration.\nSlumped on the opposite end of the couch, John idly picks at his keyboard, his vision wavering at the corners.\n\u201cSo,\u201d John says, trying not to rub at his eyes but failing, \u201cso your sources say that Scant may have been using the Jabez Biz boxes.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s evident that he wanted Jabez Wilson out of the office for some amount of time every day, possibly to use the company machines,\u201d Sherlock says, still typing. \u201cRHL Incorporated was clearly invented entirely for that purpose. But something\u2019s missing. Why would Scant need those particular machines? He\u2019s a hacker; he can mask his IP address, make it appear as if he\u2019s working from any location. But he needed to be in that office.\u201d\n\u201cSo he could hack from anywhere, theoretically, but he needed to be in that spot,\u201d John says.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s brow furrows. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\nJohn stifles a yawn, squints at the screen. He\u2019s got at least twenty windows open, all research: maps, search results, chat windows to correspond with Sherlock\u2019s contacts in the hacker world. \u201cLooks like there\u2019s a Starbucks across the street from that office. Maybe he really needed the caffeine. God knows I do.\u201d He sits up a bit and coughs, studies Google Street View. \u201cOr, you know, free WiFi.\u201d\nThe noise of Sherlock\u2019s fingers tapping on the keyboard stops abruptly.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Sherlock breathes, \u201cOh --\u201d and John knows that sound by now, that focused gasp of realization. Here it is. At last.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThe WiFi, John. Brilliant. You\u2019re brilliant.\u201d Sherlock slams his laptop shut abruptly, discards it on the table; he is all motion and purpose, pacing from window to couch.\n\u201cCan I get that in writing?\u201d\nSherlock ignores him. \u201cThe only reason a hacker as gifted as Scant would risk working from the same location every day would be if the location itself was important. What could be important about that particular office? The building shares a wall with a branch of the Bank of England. It\u2019s entirely possible that the bank\u2019s WiFi signal would be accessible from a machine in the building next door.\u201d\n\u201cSo he used the Jabez machines to access the bank\u2019s wireless network.\u201d\n\u201cBank systems are incredibly secure,\u201d Sherlock says. \u201cThis system is likely separate from the Internet itself, a contained unit. But someone physically near the building might be able to breach their security if they can hack into their WiFi. Everything we\u2019ve seen so far indicates that Scant has been after passwords, employee data from that particular building. I assumed he was attempting identity theft; he\u2019s done it before. But maybe he\u2019s got an entirely different goal. Maybe he\u2019s figured out how to break into the bank itself.\u201d\n\u201cHe shut down RHL yesterday, though,\u201d John says. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nSherlock stops pacing. \u201cHe\u2019s finished,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cHe must have gotten through. Set up the hack. Everything\u2019s in place.\u201d He whirls to grab his coat where it lies discarded over the back of a chair. \u201cGet your gun.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll have to go down to the office to start the process. We may still be in time. He could be aware that someone\u2019s been asking questions. Come on, John.\u201d\n\u201cChrist.\u201d John struggles to his feet, and the world moves in slow-and-quick spurts like a dream, and before he can think about it the door of 221b rushes up to meet them and they\u2019re out of the flat and into a taxi, John ducking under Sherlock\u2019s arm as he holds the door open.\nThe dim light of the cab illuminates Sherlock\u2019s profile, coat collar turned up, wrapped in his scarf, texting, untouchable. The swift sweep of streetlight carves out the valleys and shadows of his face, the purposeful slope of his nose, the too-sharp cheekbones. He hasn\u2019t eaten, John thinks absently. Must remember to make him eat when we get home.\nAt first Sherlock\u2019s face seemed alien, disconcerting: slanted, eerily bright eyes, too many angles, unearthly and pale. Now it\u2019s familiar, but still fascinating. John feels as if he\u2019s been put in charge of some exotic creature, some rare species almost never found in the wild. A species unbound to any earthly requirements, like food or sleep, but somehow needing them regardless, needing John to put on the kettle and make sure something is in the fridge other than severed limbs.\nSherlock hums, satisfied, and John\u2019s pulse skips.\n\u201cLestrade\u2019s sending backup. We could run into trouble if Scant thinks someone might be coming. Ah, here.\u201d He slides forward in his seat, addresses the cab driver. \u201cStop, please.\u201d\nThey clamber out of the cab, John\u2019s gun a reassuring weight against his back as they jog silently past empty office buildings until Sherlock holds out an arm to stop them.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he says, and ducks into an alley lined with slick cobblestones. \u201cThis one. Jabez rents a cubicle on the first floor.\u201d\nSherlock fits a key into the large industrial back-door lock of one of the stone buildings opening onto the alley, and they slip inside. It\u2019s a typical tech office, rows of cubicles, monitors mostly darkened, machines still humming under the desks. Sherlock\u2019s eyes scan the dark as they move through the room. He doesn\u2019t speak, simply gestures at a printed card tacked to a nondescript cubicle near the end of the row: Jabez Biz.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll wait here.\u201d Sherlock pulls John out of sight behind the row of cubicles directly opposite, sliding down against the partition with a hand on John\u2019s elbow.\nThe office is utterly silent but for the white noise of electronics. Sherlock peers into the dark, his long fingers unconsciously encircling John\u2019s bicep, warm pulse points on the thin canvas of his jacket.\nJohn lets out a breath, settling into the familiar kick of adrenaline that\u2019s elevating his heart rate. Best case scenario, they\u2019re waiting to ambush a single man; worst case, their target has invited a few skilled friends more than happy to rub out a meddling detective. John\u2019s knees scream in protest as he shifts his weight; Sherlock\u2019s hand tightens around his arm.\nSomething warm and light, likely born of sleep deprivation, blooms in John\u2019s chest. He hasn\u2019t slept, has barely eaten, is crouched behind a desk at three in the morning with his gun at his back, Sherlock crowded against his side in his long coat, collar up against the dark, and this is absolutely, unequivocally where John wants to be.\nIt\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s more than absurd, actually. John\u2019s life is, by definition, without purpose, without a mission, and yet he\u2019s found one, nonetheless, and it\u2019s here. Here, in this absurd office building at three in the morning. Here at Sherlock\u2019s side, two pressed into one, brain and gun and two pounding hearts.I love this, he thinks, God help me, and he tries to swallow a helpless giggle that escapes in an awkward huff of breath.\nSherlock\u2019s head whips around at the noise, and despite the dim light, John sees his brow furrow in disapproval. John bites his lip; Sherlock\u2019s eyes glint as he studies John\u2019s face. They narrow, a clear message. John nods an apology, but he can\u2019t stop his shoulders from hitching, once.\nSherlock leans in, his breath warm on John\u2019s cheek. \u201cJohn,\u201d he says warningly, his voice an impossibly low rumble.\nJohn is suddenly aware of their faces, so close, and his thudding pulse. The rhythm of this feels familiar. He knows how this should go, the inevitable gravity when lips are next to his as Sherlock\u2019s are. He could lean forward so easily, taste the sweet arch of Sherlock\u2019s mouth.\nHe rocks back on his heels; the thought sends him reeling. He must be delirious, punch-drunk on nerves, awake far too long. Sherlock turns away again, peers into the dark.\nBut the thought lingers ten minutes later, when Sherlock pins John Clay -- alias Scant, alias Victor Spaulding -- to the ground under one angular knee, and John trains his gun firmly over Clay\u2019s right eye. Even after that, when the cops show up and Sherlock launches into explanations and logs into company computers and provides incriminating proof for hours, John can still feel the warm shadow of Sherlock\u2019s mouth close to his.\n* * *\nThe lean blur of Sherlock Holmes looms over John, jolting him awake after a sickeningly insufficient amount of sleep. The couch. He must have fallen asleep on the couch, still in jeans and a t-shirt from yesterday, or possibly the day before; it\u2019s hard to keep track at this point.\n\u201cThey need us. Follow-up questions, paperwork. Down at the Jabez building. Coming?\u201d\nJohn\u2019s fuzzy brain can think of several responses, none of which are particularly polite. Sherlock\u2019s asking, so John will be there; this is now a basic law of physics, so not much point in protesting. \u201cMmm,\u201d he says, dragging a hand over his eyes. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cCoffee,\u201d Sherlock says, already wearing his coat. He tosses John a jumper.\n\u201cRight.\u201d John stands up to pull it over his head, grimacing. His shoulder feels sharp and sore from his extended nap on the couch. By the looks of the light filtering through the windows, it\u2019s mid-morning, and he\u2019s had maybe four hours of sleep at best. \u201cI\u2019ll make some.\u201d\n\u201cKeep up, John.\u201d Sherlock hands John his stainless steel travel mug, the one John uses if he has a morning shift at the office. \u201cI know what you\u2019re like when your REM cycle is interrupted.\u201d\nThe mug is heavy, warm. Sherlock never makes coffee.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d John mumbles, but Sherlock is already halfway out the door.\nThe office building is entirely mundane in daylight, and full of office workers who keep glancing uneasily at the handful of Yard detectives clustered around the Jabez cubicle.\nA pointy-looking detective intent on getting an official statement immediately drags Sherlock away, leaving John to hover awkwardly next to the two men seated at the Jabez computers. One is clearly a Yard detective; the other looks to be more comfortable with machines than with humans, given his hunched posture and fixed gaze on the screen in front of him.\n\u201cA few more minutes, almost finished running the backup,\u201d the hunched man says. His voice is almost lilting.\n\u201cWhat about this machine?\u201d the detective says as John steps closer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get logs for this one here, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be working.\u201d\nThe first man sits up stiffly, cracks his neck. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, and there\u2019s a hint of archness underneath his voice. \u201cHave you tried turning it off, and then on again?\u201d\nThe detective sighs and looks up at John. \u201cYou\u2019re the other IT tech, I hope? This is taking longer than we\u2019d expected.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, nope. I\u2019m with -- him.\u201d John points. \u201cSherlock Holmes. He\u2019s -- er, we\u2019re consulting on the case.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d The detective sighs, stands up. \u201cRight. I\u2019ll put a call in then, see if someone else is coming.\u201d\nThe first man -- clearly an IT tech, then -- turns to look at John. He has close-cropped dark hair, wide dark eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re with Sherlock Holmes?\u201d he says with a near-boyish shyness. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of him.\u201d\nJohn blinks. \u201cHave you?\u201d\nThe tech stands up, extends a hand; John shakes it. \u201cJim Zucco. IT consultant.\u201d\n\u201cJohn Watson. I\u2019m...\u201d John says, and then the back of John's neck crawls. His shoulder sends a sharp bite of pain down his elbow and nearly to the tips of his fingers. \u201c...Sherlock\u2019s colleague,\u201d he manages, trying not to wince. He must have slept awkwardly on the couch; his shoulder can be annoyingly sensitive.\n\u201cOh, the blogger, right?\u201d Jim says, dark eyes scanning John\u2019s face.\nJohn\u2019s phone chirps in his pocket. Given that the usual cause for John\u2019s phone chirping is standing mere feet away and clearly isn\u2019t responsible, this is puzzling.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m -- sorry, hang on,\u201d John says, fishing his phone from his jacket. \u201cMight have to take this.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d Jim says, settling back into his seat.It would seem that your current case is wrapping up. The Andrew West matter remains a critical situation. MH\nChrist. John really isn\u2019t in the mood for standing in the firing line of Sherlock and Mycroft\u2019s feud at the moment.\nActually, he\u2019s never in the mood, but that\u2019s beside the point.Will keep Andrew West in mind, John types, and hits Send. He watches as Jim switches on the second machine, maneuvers the keyboard and mouse into a different position with some difficulty.\nMouse on the left side.\nJohn feels that familiar unease that kicks in whenever he notices a fellow Lefty: he\u2019s surprised, always, to see another, and then annoyed at himself for being surprised, because really, why should he be?\nJohn\u2019s phone chirps again. Please do. MH\n\u201cHate when they do that,\u201d John says, and Jim turns, eyebrows raised. \u201cThe mouse. They always make the cords too short to switch over.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Jim says, and the word is heavy, a pun; the secret society nod, as it were. An instant kinship of sorts. Two Lefties -- always a bit unusual anywhere outside the Army. \u201cThis office is clearly stuck in the last decade, I mean, everyone else has switched to cordless anyway.\u201d\n\u201cThank God for trackpads,\u201d John says.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cJohn.\u201d A deep baritone at John\u2019s ear; Sherlock has materialized by John\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re done here.\u201d\nOf course. John wasn\u2019t needed, not really. He could still be sleeping on the couch, for God\u2019s sake.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d John raises an eyebrow, folds his arms over his chest.\nSherlock reads John\u2019s look with practised expertise. \u201cSleep is overrated.\u201d He tilts his head. \u201cLunch?\u201d\n\u201cI thought food was also overrated.\u201d\nSherlock looks mildly amused. He doesn\u2019t wait for John to answer, just turns on his heel and strides away.\nJohn gives Jim an apologetic wave. \u201cSorry, got to run.\u201d\n\u201cNice meeting you.\u201d\n\u201cIT contractor. Fellow Lefty,\u201d Sherlock comments as John falls into step with him.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d John says. \u201cSherlock. Your brother is texting me. He wants us to look at the Andrew West case.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, do you care?\u201d\nSherlock turns back to look at John, still walking, and raises an innocent eyebrow. \u201cThere\u2019s a place near Grosvenor Square that has excellent dim sum.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s one way to answer that question.\u201d\n\u201cComing?\u201d Sherlock backs into the double glass entry doors, pushing them wide open and stepping out into the overcast London morning.\n\u201cDon\u2019t I always?\u201d John says, catching the door as it nearly slams shut a few inches from his nose.\nThey are just rounding the corner to Baker Street, John sleepy and sated after one too many pork bao, when the side of the building explodes.\n* * *\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d John says, following Sherlock into Lestrade\u2019s office. \u201cI thought it was a gas leak?\u201cWe thought so too, or at least that seemed the most logical theory two days ago,\u201d the Detective Inspector says, running a hand through his greying hair.\u201cYou found something at the bomb site.\u201d Sherlock gives Lestrade a keen look that verges somewhat inappropriately on giddy excitement.\u201cWell, at first it seemed a bit of a coincidence, this little event across the street from your flat,\u201d Lestrade says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a crew in to clean up the scene. Set up to look like a gas leak, but appears to be the work of someone quite experienced with bombs. The basement was empty except for a strongbox. And this was inside the box.\u201dLestrade hands Sherlock a pristine, heavy envelope. Written across it in looping, neat script are the words Sherlock Holmes.\u201cChrist,\u201d John murmurs.\u201cThis does complicate matters.\u201d Sherlock turns the envelope over in his hands, failing to conceal the eagerness in his voice. John leans in on pretence of examining the envelope and nudges Sherlock gently with one shoulder. Sherlock doesn\u2019t react, but John knows well enough that the subtle reminder has been received.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve had the dogs check it out. Appears to be clean,\u201d Lestrade supplies.\u201cI trust your dogs.\u201d Sherlock opens the envelope deftly, and a mobile in a pink case drops into his palm.They all stare at it.\u201cThat\u2019s... the phone,\u201d John says finally. \u201cFrom the serial suicide case. A Study in Pink.\u201d\u201cNot the same phone,\u201d Sherlock says, turning it over. \u201cBut an identical copy. Someone\u2019s gone to a lot of trouble to make it look the same.\u201dSherlock presses a button, and the phone broadcasts four distinct, familiar blips.Lestrade's eyes widen. \"Are those the bloody Greenwich pips?\"\"Four. Four pips,\" Sherlock murmurs.John leans over Sherlock's elbow to peer at the phone. \"That's... different.\"The phone\u2019s screen displays the image of a dingy room with peeling wallpaper and a decrepit fireplace.\"That phone case was made by Speck, it's sold on Amazon and in Apple retail stores,\" drawls a voice from the doorway.Anderson. A person synonymous in John\u2019s mind with instant conflict where Sherlock is concerned. Unfortunately, steering Sherlock away from the conflict is a bit like piloting the Titanic away from an iceberg.\u201cThanks, Anderson, we\u2019ve got it covered --\u201d John says, without turning around.\u201cAnderson, shut up,\u201d Sherlock interrupts.John raises a cautionary eyebrow at Sherlock, but if Sherlock sees it, he pretends to ignore it.\"Just trying to help. In 2009 there were two versions of that case produced --\"\"Anderson, we all know your affinity for random pieces of trivia, you never waste an opportunity to remind us. However, showering everyone with useless information is like smearing sheep dung on a blood sample.\"\u201cSherlock,\u201d John hisses under his breath, and then raises his voice. \u201cWe\u2019re good here, Anderson. Really.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s so loyal,\u201d Anderson says from the doorway, voice full of enough sarcasm that John turns to look. \u201cSherlock, I never would have taken you for the Outreach type.\u201d\u201cAnderson!\u201d Lestrade exclaims, but Sherlock interrupts him. \u201cYou may pride yourself on details, Anderson,\u201d he says, deep voice reverberating with fury, \u201cbut you consistently miss the big picture.\u201d\u201cDo I.\u201d Anderson folds his arms.\u201cQuite,\u201d Sherlock says, whip-quick. \u201cNo amount of trivial knowledge can make up for the fact that you\u2019re a blazing idiot.\u201dAnderson opens his mouth to respond, but Lestrade cuts him off abruptly. \u201cEnough,\u201d he bellows. \u201cOut, Anderson. You\u2019re out of line. And Sherlock, I can\u2019t have you coming down here if you can\u2019t work with my team.\u201dAnderson shoots Sherlock a murderous glare and vanishes from the doorway.\u201cGood luck with the case, then,\u201d Sherlock says icily, \u201cinvolving the phone addressed to me.\u201dJohn finds his voice at last. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he says quickly. \u201cJust -- it\u2019s fine. Forget it. It\u2019s fine. Seriously.\u201d His left hand clenches, nails digging into his palm. He unclenches it. It curls up again reflexively.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, John,\u201d Lestrade says gravely, clearly uncomfortable. \u201cGoes without saying, off-hand remarks aren\u2019t permitted in this workplace. Anderson will be getting an official reprimand for that. Don\u2019t know what\u2019s got into him.\u201d He sighs, looks over at Sherlock, who is once again riveted by the pink phone. \u201cWell, actually, I do. Still, no excuse for it. And Sherlock -- Sherlock, are you listening? You\u2019re not to insult my team. It doesn\u2019t help.\u201dJohn swallows, looks away. Invisibility isn\u2019t a known knack, but that doesn\u2019t stop John wishing for it.\u201cI intend to continue informing Anderson that he is an idiot because he is one,\u201d Sherlock says quietly. \u201cI will continue to call him an idiot regardless of whether or not he chooses to insult John.\u201d\u201cSherlock.\u201d Lestrade\u2019s voice is hard-edged, notched with anger. \u201cI have no problem banning you from this investigation. I don\u2019t care if your name is on the bloody envelope or not.\u201dSherlock falls silent, eyes on Lestrade.\u201cThe message has a photo,\u201d Sherlock says flatly, and holds the phone out. \u201cThe interior of a flat. I think I know where this is.\u201dAnother beat of silence. Sherlock and Lestrade regard each other from across the room. John feels himself slide into invisibility at last -- at least, the everyday invisibility he\u2019s grown used to, at Sherlock\u2019s side. It\u2019s somehow both a relief and an exceedingly gentle punch to the gut.\u201cRight, then,\u201d Lestrade says, motioning to the door, and then they\u2019re all in motion, and it\u2019s all about Sherlock, as it should be, as it always is, and as they hop into a cab bound for 221b -- of course, Baker Street, why would it be anywhere else -- all points lead to Sherlock, and John is along for the ride.* * *Even Mrs Hudson\u2019s perfect cuppa can\u2019t erase the unsettling fact that someone has broken into the locked basement flat at 221c and left a single pair of trainers. Right below them, right below the world\u2019s only consulting detective, someone has slipped undetected, ghostlike, invading the comforting bubble of Baker Street.The pink phone rang once while they were down there, and a gasping voice told Sherlock that he had twelve hours before another explosion lit up London.Now a frazzled Mrs Hudson cleans up the remnants of tea and biscuits as Sherlock stares at the worn pair of athletic shoes on their kitchen counter. Long lengths of shoelace dangle from a clothesline above the sink. Sherlock has been at the lab most of the afternoon. He didn\u2019t ask for company, and John didn\u2019t offer it.Eight hours left.\u201cThanks, Mrs. H,\u201d John calls after her as she glances warily at Sherlock on her way out of the flat.\u201cGood luck, boys,\u201d she calls back.Sherlock settles onto the stool in the kitchen, perching to peer into the microscope. A wall of silence descends.John recognizes Sherlock\u2019s unspoken signals, leaves him to his work. After twenty minutes he realizes he\u2019s been reading the same sentence in his crime novel repeatedly; the time limit has his nerves on edge, his shoulders knotted together. This is pointless. He stands, unsure, and hovers near the kitchen doorway. Sherlock hasn\u2019t moved; he\u2019s still at the microscope. The air seems heavy, cut with unease.Sherlock\u2019s mobile chimes, muffled, somewhere in the kitchen.\u201cPass me my phone,\u201d Sherlock says.\u201cWhere is it?\u201d\u201cJacket.\u201dSeveral choice epithets hover at the tip of John\u2019s tongue, but he swallows them.Sherlock\u2019s pale, mesmerizing hands cradle the microscope, adjusting the focus. The narrow slant of his shoulders is somehow commanding, stretching the paper-thin fabric of his pressed shirt. John knows what Sherlock had for breakfast; he knows where Sherlock keeps his mobile phone. He knows bloody well what Sherlock is asking.The space between them is vanishing with time, pushing air out of John\u2019s lungs.Sherlock\u2019s phone chimes again, and John is defeated. He steps into the kitchen, crowds up against Sherlock\u2019s sharp shoulder, resignation blurring with anger. He doesn\u2019t want to think about why he does this.Maybe because no one else is allowed this close.John slides a hand into Sherlock\u2019s jacket. Sherlock has a deftly intoxicating scent, tea and lab chemicals and a hint of that cigarette he wasn\u2019t supposed to sneak this afternoon. John\u2019s hand closes around the phone, accidentally slips against the smooth plane of Sherlock\u2019s pressed shirt.Sherlock inhales, a quick sip of breath. \u201cCareful.\u201dJohn withdraws, anger spiking behind his eyes, as Sherlock flinches in annoyance, adjusts the microscope. Their faces are dangerously close, but John can\u2019t step back, or he won\u2019t; he hovers, deliberately invading space, taking up room. He taps the phone, his chest nearly to Sherlock\u2019s shoulder, not bothering to move.\u201cText from your brother,\u201d John says, low-voiced, in Sherlock\u2019s ear.\u201cDelete it,\u201d Sherlock\u2019s fingers twist the microscope dials, arms tensed wire-tight.John hits a button on the phone, slides it onto the counter next to Sherlock, still crowded into his space, dull anger thumping like a drum in his ears. \u201cAnything else?\u201d he mutters. \u201cOr is this Outreach worker free to go?\u201dSherlock\u2019s eyes snap to John\u2019s. \u201cIs that what you think this is?\u201d he says, not bothering to draw back, each word bitten and sharp.John crosses his arms, close enough to brush against Sherlock\u2019s shoulder. He\u2019s seized with the urge to push, to shove, to lay siege to Sherlock\u2019s space the way Sherlock has blotted out everything else in John\u2019s mind.\u201cYou can be honest,\u201d John says. The air between them is dense, unyielding. John\u2019s heart thuds, and he shivers with the force of it.A pale hand unfolds, comes to rest on the counter. Their eyes lock. Sherlock looks at him, that sharp, gears-turning look usually reserved for corpses and suspects and severed body parts.Sherlock exhales, a single, quiet sound: \"Oh.\"John\u2019s skin crawls. It's familiar, that bright click of realization: Sherlock's knack firing. If irony was a weapon, John would certainly be dead right now.Sherlock\u2019s eyes shift, unreadable, pale chips of flint. His voice is hushed, hesitant. \"Your pupils dilate when we're near, your voice goes up a half-step in pitch, you talk more quickly. You're experiencing localized vasodilation, and your heart rate...\"John feels as if he's in freefall, wind whistling past his ears. He takes an abrupt step back, closes his eyes, wills his heart to stop pounding. \u201cShut up,\u201d he hears himself say. \u201cJust shut up, Sherlock, if you\u2019re taking the piss -- if this is a bloody joke --\u201dHe feels, rather than sees, Sherlock stand up next to him, edging back into his space. A whisper: \u201cJohn.\u201dJohn opens his eyes, and Sherlock looks agitated; he scrubs a hand through his curls, but doesn\u2019t back away. \u201cYou,\u201d Sherlock says in weak surprise, and gestures between them cautiously, and for the first time John can remember he looks utterly helpless, confused.And then John\u2019s thoughts flood with a deluge of images: Sherlock, coat whirling as they race in step, machine-gun brilliance, the particular smile only John gets to see. Sherlock hovering next to him, heavy smooth angles and nimble hands, dark voice like a drug. It all makes sense. It all piles inward, crushing, coalescing. Sherlock.John\u2019s eyes go wide, and he swallows.\u201cI can\u2019t, I -- John,\u201d Sherlock says, stuttering, lost, as if words are an enemy: \u201cI -- need you, if you\u2019re not there, I -- I want --\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d John interrupts, and the sheer lightness of clarity is dizzying. Sherlock. There are no other thoughts; there is no space to hold them. John steps in, twines his hands around Sherlock's neck, and pulls him into a kiss.Their mouths meet and Sherlock doesn't move, and John has a long moment of sheer terror, fuck, fuck -- but then Sherlock shudders and gives a faint, involuntary moan, and his lips part and they dissolve into each other with desperate shock.And then Sherlock's hands roam over him, for all the world like an enthusiastic, big-pawed puppy, and clearly he hasn\u2019t done this much, because it's ridiculous and there are too many teeth. Their tongues slide together, and Sherlock tries to take a gasping breath and fails, and he cups the back of John\u2019s head in those huge, long-fingered hands. It's an utter disaster and it's also possibly the best thing in the world, and John's anger filters into stunned, riotous disbelief.They break apart, breathing hard, Sherlock staring at John with a mix of incredulity and wonderment.He sweeps a tentative finger across John's forehead, just at his hairline.John hovers between astonishment and laughter. He doesn\u2019t seem to be able to move; his entire body is tingling.Sherlock\u2019s eyes go wide, his pupils dark, and the breath goes out of his lungs.\u201cCarl Powers,\u201d he says, hushed, bewildered.John is not entirely sure whether his own sanity or hearing can be trusted any longer. \u201cWhat?\u201d he manages.\u201cCarl Powers, John.\u201dSherlock disentangles abruptly, turns toward the table, peers into the microscope. \u201cMud is from Sussex, with London mud overlaying it. Child, with big feet -- these trainers belonged to Carl Powers.\u201d He leans over and begins typing on his laptop. \u201cCarl Powers, student, died nearly 20 years ago in a strange accident while racing in a school swim meet.\u201dJohn feels drained of blood, empty. His lips are rough with the warm burn of Sherlock\u2019s skin. He can only stare as Sherlock\u2019s attention flashes from microscope to laptop and back again.\u201cI\u2019m going to need to run some more tests. Look up Carl Powers, see what you can find online, newspaper articles, anything.\u201dJohn\u2019s entire body feels whipcord-tense. He clears his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s it, then?\u201d he says, voice husky.Sherlock looks up at him, and his expression flickers from focus to something like pain.\u201cThe bomb,\u201d he says quietly.John nods.\u201cCarl Powers,\u201d he repeats, numb, and squares his shoulders against the war in his thoughts.* * *The kiss is like a bullet, burning at its source, commanding John\u2019s energy. It\u2019s all so familiar, really, an echo of the past, another shockwave tearing into John, body and mind. Blindsided, shot from an impossible distance. Sherlock recognized John\u2019s feelings, deduced John\u2019s feelings before John himself had a chance. And now, the wound, the aftermath: John\u2019s life irrevocably torn, rearranged.He wants Sherlock, apparently, and now that Sherlock has pointed it out, John can\u2019t unsee it, a bit like seeing a face in the black-and-white silhouette of a vase. Recognizable now for what it is.It makes no sense at all, and yet it also makes perfect sense: the intensity, the connection, all of it. But there\u2019s no time to make sense of it, even if John wanted to. The clock ticks irrevocably, eclipsing everything but the case before them.They have two hours left.They haven\u2019t spoken, much.\u201cI\u2019m getting food,\u201d John may have said, at some point.Sherlock has been to the lab and back again to double-check test results. John\u2019s printouts of Google searches and newspaper clippings litter the kitchen table. He knows Sherlock\u2019s mind has shifted into high gear, that heightened, focused solitude of purpose. John waits.He\u2019s gotten three texts from Mycroft, and one from Lestrade.His shoulder hurts.With roughly one hour left, John stands, hovers again by the sliding door to the kitchen.\u201cLet me help,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to help.\u201dSherlock looks up from the microscope -- lips, John thinks, hands. Christ. John rubs the back of his neck. Focus, damn it.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing -- Oh.\u201dSherlock peers into the microscope again, then looks up, triumphant, and slams his hands down on the kitchen table, rattling the petri dishes. \u201cPoison. Clostridium Botulinum. On the shoelaces. Almost undetectable. Carl Powers was murdered, John. He had eczema, it would have been easy enough to introduce it into his medication.\u201cJohn\u2019s mind kicks into gear slowly. \u201cAll those years ago. But the killer... kept the shoes.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Sherlock breathes, standing up, pushing the kitchen stool backwards. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCarl\u2019s killer is our bomber.\u201dSherlock\u2019s fingers fly across the laptop keys. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it clear we\u2019ve made the connection.\u201d He hits a final keystroke, and as if on cue, the pink phone, which has been silent, startles into life with an urgent ring.Sherlock picks up the phone, sets it to speaker, and places it on the table between them. Their eyes meet.\u201cHello?\u201d Sherlock says.\u201cWell done, you.\u201d The voice is desperate, the line thick with static.\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Sherlock urges, eyes still fixed on John. \u201cTell us where you are.\u201dThe flat falls away, leaving only the desperate voice: a woman, maybe John\u2019s age, utterly alone. Terrified. John steps in, listening, leans in next to Sherlock; the police have a trace on the line, but no knowing how long it will take them to get there.\u201cKeep talking,\u201d John hears himself say. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming, all right? You\u2019re going to be okay.\u201dTen minutes or a year later -- it\u2019s impossible to tell -- John can hear the noise of an ambulance through the static on the line, and the woman\u2019s breathing evens. \u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re here, thank God, someone\u2019s here,\u201d and the call cuts off with a click.Sherlock has been leaning on the table. All at once the tension goes out of his arms, and his head slumps. He looks over at John, eyes red-rimmed with exhaustion.Then Sherlock leans in, and John must have leaned in too, without even noticing, because in one rush of exhale their lips crush together again, relief, want, and Sherlock fists a handful of John\u2019s jumper in one large hand and pulls their bodies together with clumsy, urgent strength.\u201cChrist,\u201d John gasps as they break apart, as Sherlock\u2019s head dips, his mouth seeking the place where John\u2019s neck meets his shoulder, just at the edge of his shirt collar. \u201cSherlock --\u201d\u201cHush.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s word is near-slurred, deep with gravel, and goes straight to John\u2019s cock.John tries again, fighting waves of arousal. \u201cSherlock, I --\u201d\u201cI saw.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s words fight through ragged breath. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know. But I saw.\u201d\u201cI --\u201d John shuts his eyes. Sherlock does something unthinkably incredible with his tongue right at the edge of John\u2019s collarbone, and John gasps. \u201cSherlock. Wait.\u201dSherlock lifts his head, both long hands wrapped around John\u2019s biceps. John\u2019s arms have twined around Sherlock\u2019s, hands around Sherlock\u2019s forearms, and if John doesn\u2019t want this, his body apparently has other plans.\u201cWhy?\u201d Sherlock breathes, and John opens his mouth to answer, but finds that the part of his mind responsible for the hard, insistent cock in his jeans has completely taken over. He can\u2019t think of a single reason why he shouldn\u2019t fling himself into an intensely sexual relationship with his intensely unusual flatmate. Curious, because less than an hour ago he\u2019d been able to think of plenty of reasons why this might be a stupendously bad idea, but at the moment, none of those reasons appear to make logical sense.\u201cYou -- you want to do this,\u201d John stutters, and one of Sherlock\u2019s hands slides down John\u2019s side, exploring John\u2019s ribs, his hipbone under his jeans, and John bites his lip to keep from moaning.\u201cObviously.\u201d Lips are now exploring the other side of John\u2019s neck, tracking the cord of tense muscle there. John fights to keep a coherent thread of thought before Sherlock\u2019s lips blot out coherence entirely.\u201cIs this -- have you done this before?\u201d John had hoped to phrase this in a more diplomatic way, but all but the most basic forms of communication appear to have been wiped from his mind.A huff of laughter. \u201cVaguely.\u201d Sherlock pulls back again; John can see a flush blooming across the fine bones of his exposed collarbone, the high color in his pale cheeks. It\u2019s so glorious, so unexpected, that John feels himself close to laughter. He can\u2019t help a hesitant grin.\u201cVaguely is good,\u201d he says, and Sherlock grins back, a wicked, purely happy smile, and John abandons any hope of protest. He pulls Sherlock in for another kiss. Sherlock\u2019s a quick study, because this time it\u2019s fluid, less frantic, and intense enough that John\u2019s knees nearly give way, and Sherlock has to stagger backwards to stay upright.\u201cSofa,\u201d John gasps into the crook of Sherlock\u2019s neck.Sherlock hums in agreement. He disengages, staring down at John, intent, slanted eyes heavy-lidded and soft.John could say something now; he could back away, put space between them. Deep breaths, laugh it off, attribute their momentary loss of sanity to the stress of the case. Now would be the time. Normalcy restored.Sherlock tilts his head in the direction of the living room and reaches up to unbutton the top button of his immaculate, deep purple dress shirt.Fuck normalcy, John thinks.The two of them manage to make it nearly to the sofa, somehow avoiding disaster even when the back of Sherlock\u2019s leg hits the coffee table and they both stagger sideways. John attempts to undo Sherlock\u2019s remaining shirt buttons while Sherlock simultaneously wrestles John\u2019s cardigan off his shoulders.One last wisp of protest filters through John\u2019s overloaded senses. \u201cSherlock,\u201d he gasps, as they sway on the spot and Sherlock relieves him of his jumper at last. \u201cWe should -- talk.\u201d\u201cTalk, then.\u201d Sherlock busies himself with the buttons on John\u2019s checkered button-down. He\u2019s distractingly bare-chested, shirt entirely open down the front, his flat, narrow chest rising and falling.\u201cI\u2019m -- not gay.\u201dSherlock pauses, eyes flickering over John, his mussed shirt, the obvious hard-on straining against his jeans.\u201cNoted,\u201d Sherlock says darkly, and the corner of his mouth twitches. His fingers, still working on John\u2019s buttons, pause.Time slows. They wait a beat, no noise but the sound of their quickened breath.\u201cOkay,\u201d John says, and reaches for Sherlock again, pulling him close.This kiss is deep, purposeful; it sends shocks nearly down to John\u2019s toes, and they crumple sideways onto the sofa. Sherlock's hands stroke the denim of John's jeans and come to rest over John's erection, and John swears colourfully as his vision nearly goes white and shivers run the length of his spine. Deft fingers start to undo John's belt; John can feel Sherlock's erection now, pressing urgently against John\u2019s stomach through the thin fabric of Sherlock's trousers. Unconsciously, John rolls their hips together, hard, one hand against Sherlock's hardening cock.Sherlock's wide-eyed gasp nearly brings John over the edge. He drops his forehead against John's shoulder and sucks in a long breath.\u201cJohn,\u201d he breathes. \u201cYou --\u201dTheir eyes meet, and Sherlock\u2019s are dark with arousal, wonder, and something raw.This is new.John unfastens Sherlock\u2019s trousers, watching him, eyes still locked. Sherlock\u2019s hand stills on John\u2019s jeans. \u201cAll right?\u201d John whispers.\u201cYes,\u201d Sherlock says, an uneven rasp.John slips a hand down into Sherlock\u2019s trousers, below the smooth waistband of his pants, as Sherlock watches him. All new. There were times in the army, to be sure, when John had been miles away from anything, when friendships blurred into need and fumbled groping in the dark; this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s had another man\u2019s cock in his hand. But it\u2019s never been like this before, this naked, charged connection.His best friend.John\u2019s hand closes around Sherlock\u2019s cock; Sherlock\u2019s eyes flutter closed at last. He gasps, arches against John, hips snapping up and driving into him, and John bites back a moan. It\u2019s too much, tangled limbs, Sherlock\u2019s head thrown back, the slick couch and Sherlock\u2019s hands everywhere. All at once the room blinks out and John is only nerve endings and heat and a single point of sensation, and then: release.At some point Sherlock stirs underneath him; they are sticky, spent, clothes half-on. It\u2019s like a strange dream: this looks like their flat, but it can\u2019t be, because in their flat John is never half-naked, tangled on the sofa with Sherlock. It\u2019s pure surrealism, a Magritte composition. Floating apples and men in suits are surely due to appear in the window at any moment.John shifts to the side, disentangling. \u201cJohn,\u201d Sherlock murmurs, loose-limbed, utterly spent, and he has more fondness in his voice than John can rightly absorb.A stab of fierce possessiveness startles John. Sherlock, unshielded.\u201cBe right back,\u201d John says, struggling half-upright. \u201cOkay?\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dWhen John returns from the washroom with a damp flannel, Sherlock hasn\u2019t moved; he\u2019s breathing deeply, evenly.Exhaustion seeps into John like the pull of high tide. He hesitates, then looks at the ruin of Sherlock\u2019s bespoke trousers and sighs.Sherlock is utterly gone, oblivious to John\u2019s ministrations. When at last both of them are clean, John fetches the afghan from the back of his armchair and drapes it over Sherlock\u2019s naked lower half. He gathers the wreckage of his own clothing and looks down again at Sherlock. Sherlock\u2019s jaw is slack, his eyelashes unexpectedly dark against flushed cheeks.John isn\u2019t even aware of his remaining internal walls crumbling into ruin, but they must have, because he doesn\u2019t hesitate this time. The couch is too small for the both of them, but it\u2019s all fine.John settles in against the solid, warm weight of Sherlock Holmes, who drapes an arm around him. He kicks the afghan back over their tangled legs, shuts his eyes, and surrenders.\n* * *\nSomewhere, distantly, a phone chirps: Text message.\nJohn is in the desert. It\u2019s warm and uncomfortably bright. His shoulder is whole, unblemished. His unit must be nearby; he hears voices.\n\u201c...must be this way,\u201d one voice is saying. Sherlock. The sand stretches for miles, undulating crests of gold. There\u2019s a ruined cottage in view where there wasn\u2019t, before.\n\u201cTime to move out. North. Radio to base,\u201d Sherlock\u2019s voice continues, and John knows it\u2019s wrong, this is all wrong. John\u2019s commanding officer spoke those words, once. Before the sniper.\nJohn\u2019s heart pounds. Sherlock. He reaches for his gun, but he feels nothing. He looks down.\nHis left hand is missing.\nThe phone chirps again.\nJohn struggles out of the dream gasping for breath as if he\u2019s drowning. He sits up to find he\u2019s alone on the sofa. Memories of the previous night flood him and he nearly drowns a second time.\n\u201cJohn?\u201d\nSherlock swims into view, blurred, then sharper as sleep falls away. He\u2019s in the kitchen, dressed, not a hair out of place, holding the pink phone. He raises his eyebrows in a silent question.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d John says. He wonders if he screamed. He feels a self-conscious flush crawl up his neck. \u201cDid I --\u201d\n\u201cMessage,\u201d Sherlock says, holding out the phone, and it becomes immediately clear that Sherlock is not about to comment on John\u2019s nightmare. \u201cThree pips. Photo of a car.\u201d\nJohn squints. \u201cLet me see --\u201d\n\u201cGet dressed,\u201d Sherlock continues, as if John hasn\u2019t spoken, and it also starts to become clear that Sherlock is not going to acknowledge the fact that the two of them just experienced one of the more intimate nights of John\u2019s life to date. \u201cI\u2019m sending this to Lestrade. He should be able to check the license plate against any missing vehicles.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d John says, to no one in particular, because Sherlock has vanished into the kitchen again, leaving him to get stiffly to his feet.\nHis jeans lie clumsily folded on the coffee table. He\u2019s still wearing his unbuttoned shirt, but he\u2019s not wearing pants at all. His pants have likely sought refuge under one of the flat\u2019s many deposits of random clutter. John makes a mental note to search for them before another client comes to call. Or before Mrs Hudson finds them first.\nJohn files this thought under problems he never thought he\u2019d have and gathers up his jeans. Washroom, then a shower. Try to reconcile events of the previous evening with assistance of hot water and soap.\nSherlock glances at him as he walks through the kitchen. His eyes flick over John\u2019s mostly naked form as if this was a normal, everyday occurrence.\n\u201cI\u2019ll, er, just -- be right back,\u201d John says, watching for a hint of something, anything that would indicate that things have shifted between them, moved along the friendship spectrum and into some wild new frontier. Because, after all, it is due to Sherlock that John is strolling through the kitchen in a state of near-undress.\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Sherlock says, tapping a button on his own mobile.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d John says quickly, and shuts the door of the washroom before his anxiety ratchets up to an intolerable level.\nHe finds he wants the shower nearly scalding. The burning water on his shoulders is hot enough to drive out the skittering insecurity of reality.\nHe jogs down the stairs fifteen minutes later to see Sherlock waiting for him on the lower landing, somber and distracted, still texting on his mobile.\n\u201cThe bomber called my phone while you were dressing. Clock is ticking. Our next victim gave us eight hours to solve the case.\u201d\n\u201cEight hours?\u201d John leans around the doorway, grabs his own jacket from the wall hook, and begins to shrug it on. \u201cDamn. Does Lestrade have any leads?\u201d\n\u201cThey found the car,\u201d Sherlock says, and turns toward the stairway.\n\u201cSherlock.\u201d The word escapes from John\u2019s mouth before he can stop it, but now that it\u2019s out, John isn\u2019t sure what he wants to say. About last night: horrendous clich\u00e9. We should talk: even worse. This is far beyond any known relationship territory in John\u2019s emotional map: Sherlock, I know a mad bomber has just given you eight hours to solve a case, but before we begin, was that a one-night stand or do you really feel --\nSherlock\u2019s eyes scan John\u2019s face, and John realizes belatedly that he\u2019s not sure which of these unspoken questions Sherlock might be able to see there.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d John amends.\n\u201cLestrade is meeting us,\u201d Sherlock says, but his voice is tempered, slightly softer. And then he whirls ahead of John down the dark stairwell, out onto Baker Street where a cab idles in wait.\nJohn trails behind half a step, the flare of Sherlock\u2019s coat ahead of him, and tries not to think.\n* * *\nThe abandoned construction site where they find the car is freezing and damp and desperately unpleasant. The interior of the car is also freezing and damp, and reeks of the metallic tang of blood, which soaks the driver\u2019s seat and console. The car was leased by one Ian Monkford, now listed as missing, although given the amount of blood decorating the car\u2019s interior, it\u2019s not looking particularly hopeful for Mr Monkford.\nJohn rubs gloved hands together and shadows Sherlock, who strides away from the car and through sodden puddles toward a solitary figure in the distance.\nIan Monkford\u2019s wife is unsurprisingly frayed at the edges, her lip trembling at Sherlock\u2019s approach. And Sherlock --\nSherlock is surprisingly frayed at the edges.\nSherlock blinks and speaks, and his deep voice wavers and breaks. John tries not to startle in astonishment. Just for a moment, Sherlock becomes someone else entirely.\nJohn\u2019s seen Sherlock do similar things in the past, but he\u2019s never witnessed Sherlock flip so quickly, change abruptly into someone so foreign in demeanor. Two single, perfect tears slip down Sherlock\u2019s marble cheek; a sick twist of disbelief wavers in John\u2019s gut.\nSherlock can act. And, like most things Sherlock attempts, he\u2019s brilliant at it. Frighteningly so.\nA whisper of doubt infiltrates John\u2019s already muddled thoughts. Could it be possible that Sherlock was acting last night? Once Sherlock saw John\u2019s true feelings, he could have set everything up, playing John like a chess piece, a faithful pawn. John's left hand curls into itself reflexively.\nThe tears stop. Sherlock snaps out of character. It\u2019s like flipping a light switch.\nJohn is very nearly nauseated as they walk away. Sherlock is talking, and John may even be answering, parroting rote questions back at Sherlock, why, how, but all he can see is Sherlock wiping false tears from his cheeks, as if summoning tears is the easiest thing in the world, as if emotions are something he can bend to his will, magician-like.\n\u201cFound this card in the glove box,\u201d Sherlock says, three steps ahead of him. He holds it out to John without looking, an unconscious movement born of practice, of that thing between them John has never been able to name.\nJohn unconsciously hustles the three steps ahead to keep up. He takes the card. Janus Cars.The god with two faces, John thinks, and hopes it\u2019s not a sign from the universe. If it is, the universe is pants at subtlety.\n\u201cThis way,\u201d Sherlock says, and they turn the corner, feet squelching slightly in the mud. It\u2019s drizzling now, fat drops spattering the fine leather of Sherlock\u2019s shoes. They walk on in silence for half a block, John\u2019s shoulders hunched against the rain. They need to find a cab. Likely Sherlock knows where to get one; he always does. John\u2019s mind is busy replaying Sherlock\u2019s charade, the uncanny ease of his tears.\nWhich is why when Sherlock stops abruptly, turns, puts a large hand on John\u2019s shoulder, and propels him between two crates and up against a brick wall slick with rain, John is caught so entirely off-guard that he almost clocks Sherlock with one reflexively clenched fist.\nSherlock\u2019s gloved hands pin John\u2019s shoulders to the wall and he leans in, dark curls weighted and wet. His eyes are shock-blue, still bloodshot from crying, and they narrow as he studies John\u2019s face.\nAnd then Sherlock swoops in, capturing John\u2019s mouth with his, and his tongue slips in between John\u2019s lips like a thief. John nearly goes limp against the damp bricks.This is wrong, John thinks. This is wrong, it\u2019s massively, outstandingly wrong, and just as his brain forms a coherent measurement of exactly how wrong it is, his body shudders in absolute delight and he gives into the kiss.\nAs John\u2019s knees dissolve into liquid and his hands grope against the damp wool of Sherlock\u2019s coat, Sherlock moans, so low and visceral that John nearly blacks out with arousal. John\u2019s hands grapple at anything, any part of Sherlock, at last clutching Sherlock\u2019s upturned collar as Sherlock slides closer to John, the lengths of their bodies now pressed together. Rivulets of water stream down the back of John\u2019s neck. He shivers, pulling even closer, and Sherlock moans again. Or maybe that was John. Christ.\nSherlock pulls away, long hands still heavy against John\u2019s shoulders, and blinks. \u201cBetter?\u201d he says, baritone shaky and deep.\nJohn is breathing hard enough that speaking is difficult. \u201cWh-what?\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Sherlock says, equally short of breath.\nJohn blinks back at him stupidly. Sherlock\u2019s lips are bitten and flushed, a pink cupid\u2019s bow. Ridiculous.\n\u201cYour posture is unusually tense,\u201d Sherlock says, falling into the rapid patter of deduction. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been concentrating all morning, you\u2019re distracted. You keep looking at me when you think I can\u2019t see you. Conclusion, you\u2019re doubting the validity of what transpired between us last night.\u201d\nAnger begins to fight its way through the messy soup of John\u2019s overloaded senses. \u201cSherlock,\u201d he says, through labored breath, \u201cSherlock, we kissed last night, we did more than kiss, and all morning you\u2019ve acted as if nothing\u2019s happened. What the hell was I supposed to think?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a case,\u201d Sherlock says matter-of-factly, and his forehead furrows; a crease appears between his eyebrows. \u201cOn a time limit, John.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this, just now,\u201d John says, raising a hand for emphasis -- the hand still fisted in Sherlock\u2019s collar -- \u201cthis was supposed to be what, exactly?\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s mouth drops open as if he\u2019s about to speak, but John grabs Sherlock\u2019s hands and wrenches them downward, too quickly for Sherlock to react, and steps away.\n\u201cJust brushing up on your acting? You are quite brilliant at it. Oh, don\u2019t tell me -- wait. An experiment. You\u2019re trying to see if you can make me think I\u2019m going mad.\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s face drains of colour and he takes a long step back into the muddy alleyway. \u201cI thought,\u201d he says, teeth clenched, \u201cyou\u2019d understand.\u201d\n\u201cApparently not,\u201d John says, and this is bad, even worse than the kissing, and he\u2019d really rather go back to the kissing, but somehow everything\u2019s been tilted sideways and Sherlock\u2019s eyes are snapping with hurt.\nThe rain continues to fall.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the lab,\u201d Sherlock says, and suddenly John is alone, water seeping through the worn seams of his shoes like doubt.\n* * *\nThe cab has nearly arrived at Baker Street before John fumbles in his pockets for change and pulls out the Janus Cars business card, warped with raindrops.\nJohn knows well enough that Sherlock, having looked at the card once, will remember not only the business name, but the address and likely the phone number. Certainly Sherlock can Google the place in seconds flat. Nothing on the card that Sherlock really needs. John also knows that going out of his way to return the card to Sherlock is almost entirely laughable, and Sherlock will see through it for what it really is: an apology.\nBut John, alone in the cab with a heaping supply of second thoughts, is starting to think that an apology may be due. A flimsy excuse in the form of a soggy business card is as good as any.\nHe taps on the window and redirects the cabbie, and their trajectory shifts. In a few minutes the heavy grey silhouette of St. Barts looms overhead, and John swallows pride and nerves as he swings open the door of the visitors\u2019 entrance.\nJohn was wrong, at the crime scene. He was wrong to doubt Sherlock, to think that Sherlock was playing a game. John was keyed up, overwhelmed, and the insecurity he doesn\u2019t like to acknowledge came roaring to the forefront. He\u2019ll tell this to Sherlock, or at least, he\u2019ll try. Sherlock will pick up on it, even if John doesn\u2019t quite succeed in conveying the entire message.\nSherlock knows John.\nJohn walks the familiar path to Sherlock\u2019s preferred laboratory, not entirely sure what he\u2019s going to say. Hi, kissing is okay with me. No, that doesn\u2019t entirely cover the issue. I was wrong. The words stick at the back of his throat. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing, Sherlock. Accurate, but unhelpful.\nThe hallway to the lab is entirely empty, which is why the hand that lightly touches John\u2019s elbow startles him so badly that he jumps and scrambles to put his back against the wall, every nerve singing.\nThe owner of the hand quickly removes it, and there\u2019s a hushed \u201coh,\u201d and John whips his head to scan the hallway again before he realizes that Molly Hooper is standing next to him. His heart hammers.\n\u201cJesus, Molly, sorry, I -- I didn\u2019t see you.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, I -- didn\u2019t mean it, I -- that should have gone away by now,\u201d the quiet, wide-eyed pathologist says, the last part of it almost to herself.\n\u201cWhat should have gone away by now?\u201d\nMolly looks reticent, unsure. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Are -- are you all right?\u201d\nJohn looks around, marvelling at his surroundings, which absolutely do include a Molly Hooper, although he could have sworn they didn\u2019t just a moment earlier.\n\u201cYeah. Fine. Just -- dropping something off.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. He\u2019s in there, third door on the left.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\nJohn nods, swallows, tries to quiet his racing heart. Molly steps away, then hesitates.\n\u201cYou, um. You sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d John lies. \u201cReally. Why?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d Molly bites her lip. \u201cI can tell.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d John says. \u201cI, um. Stressful case. Time limit.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Molly says, and looks entirely unconvinced.\nJohn holds up the card, gives a thin smile. \u201cI\u2019ll just -- he\u2019ll be needing this.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Molly steps back. \u201cSorry again.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem.\u201d\n\u201cSee you.\u201d\nMolly\u2019s footsteps echo down the hallway and it doesn\u2019t occur to John until his hand is on the door of the lab that he didn\u2019t notice footsteps before, when she must have approached. But now he can see Sherlock through the long pane of glass in the door, head bent over the microscope, and his mouth goes dry and all other thoughts fizzle to a quiet stop.\nJohn opens the door.\nSherlock looks up, his expression strangely blank.\nJohn holds up the Janus Cars business card. \u201cI, um. You forgot this. You probably don\u2019t need it, but.\u201d\nSherlock looks back into the microscope. A muscle in his jaw flexes. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll just -- it\u2019s here on the table.\u201d\nSherlock doesn\u2019t say anything. An empty weight settles in John\u2019s stomach. A long, bruised moment drags by.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d John says. \u201cI\u2019ll see you --\u201d\n\u201cCome look at this.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an abrupt order; John\u2019s feet obey before his mind processes the request. Sherlock leans back as John approaches and gestures at the eyepiece of the microscope.\n\u201cThis is a blood sample taken from Ian Monkford\u2019s car. I\u2019ve been running tests. This blood isn\u2019t fresh.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not? It seemed pretty fresh this morning.\u201d\n\u201cLook at the cell structure.\u201d\nJohn meets Sherlock\u2019s gaze. Sherlock nods, once. John leans in.\nThe world shrinks to the bright circle of microscope view. John blinks, tries to focus. Sherlock hasn\u2019t backed away. His shoulder nearly brushes John\u2019s.\n\u201cThe cell membranes,\u201d Sherlock says in John\u2019s ear, an intimate rumble, and John shuts his eyes against it, against the deep, frightening rush of feeling threatening to overwhelm him.\n\u201c...And the dye I\u2019ve introduced -- John.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s voice sharpens. \u201cYou\u2019re not looking.\u201d\n\u201cI trust you,\u201d John says, clearly, quietly. It is, he realizes, all he wants to say to Sherlock.\nIt\u2019s all he needs to say.\nHe pulls away from the microscope. Sherlock\u2019s face is close, eyebrows arched, gaze intent.\n\u201cFine, John, but if you\u2019d just look --\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean. I trust you.\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s eyes read John\u2019s face, read the bare emotions knit between John\u2019s brows. John swallows, tilts his chin to look up at Sherlock.\n\u201cThe blood,\u201d Sherlock says quietly, \u201cwas frozen,\u201d but his eyes say something else, something less to do with blood and more to do with John.\n\u201cFrozen,\u201d John echoes, and Sherlock leans in again around him, taps the microscope.\n\u201cLook.\u201d\nJohn looks, Sherlock\u2019s long arms braced on either side of him, and he sees, sees things that Sherlock intones in his ear, traces of glycerol, ruptured cell membranes, and he feels Sherlock\u2019s breath at the curve of his neck.\nAnd when Sherlock\u2019s rich voice finally says \u201cJanus Cars, John, we\u2019ve got to go,\u201d John realizes that at some point, in the dark, quiet universe of the microscope, his left hand has found Sherlock\u2019s, and closed over it.\n\u00a0\n* * *\nThe car rental agency is a mundane enough operation, but John is entirely on edge.\nIt\u2019s not due to any imminent danger, physical threats to his person, or any of the usual parameters John\u2019s accustomed to, working with Sherlock. No, this time the cause is a simple printed sign hanging in the office. The graphic designer in charge of the company logo was either clueless or diabolical, John\u2019s not sure which; the J and C in the company\u2019s title are strangely difficult to read, but the rest of the letters are clear as day.Bloody hell.\nJohn has been trying to process the astonishing circumstance of desiring another man so intensely, which, for John, is a first. Unexpected thoughts have been ambushing John at inopportune times.\nContinuously seeing the word \u201cAnus\u201d on the wall behind Sherlock\u2019s head is not helping.\nSherlock, for his part, seems completely able to focus. He grills the sleazy agency owner with his usual theatrical flair -- no tears this time, thankfully -- and practically drags John back to the car park at the Yard so he can astound Lestrade (and John) with a particularly jaw-dropping deduction, a pretty little stained glass window of interconnected thought. Exquisite, even for Sherlock.\nSherlock clenches a triumphant fist as they stride out of the car park and nearly crows with victory: \u201cI am on fire!\u201d\nJohn watches Sherlock, silhouetted in the dark, a grown shadow of Peter Pan: Oh, the cleverness of me. He thinks of Sherlock\u2019s clever hands and clever lips and what he\u2019d like to do with all of that cleverness when they get home.\nThey rush back to Baker Street, puzzle solved, and sit in near-electric anticipation at the living room table as Sherlock types the answer on his laptop. Congratulations to Ian Monkford on his relocation to Colombia. The lights are dim in the flat, Sherlock's pale face illuminated by the glow of the monitor. The pink phone starts to ring at almost the same fractional second that Sherlock taps the final key.\nPiccadilly Circus. A young man waits there, explosives strapped to his body, gasping on the other end of the line. The police are descending on the scene, swarming into the heart of the city. The spider spins his web, ballsy and brash, tantalizingly close.\nThe young man on the line sounds hopeful, talks faster. He's spotted a cop. A grin spreads slowly across Sherlock's face, lit with dark and light: half-wicked, half-angelic.\nThe phone beeps, and the line goes dead. The clock stops.\nJohn feels tension ebb from his body, tension he wasn\u2019t aware of until it abandons him and leaves every muscle useless. He is hungry and tired and numb. \u201cGod,\u201d he says, leaning back from the table, pressing hands over his eyes. \u201cYou did it. I don\u2019t know how. Bloody amazing.\u201d\nSherlock gets up and shrugs off his jacket, disappearing into the kitchen. John doesn\u2019t know how Sherlock\u2019s still moving; it takes all of John\u2019s remaining reserves just to flop into his usual armchair a few feet away. He hears Sherlock\u2019s warm chuckle and smiles as Sherlock\u2019s voice drifts through the flat.\n\u201cYou flatter me, John.\u201d\n\u201cIs that modesty?\u201d John leans forward stiffly, starts to untie his shoes. \u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d\nSherlock pads back into the living room, now shoeless, having acquired one of his dressing gowns seemingly from nowhere. Sherlock\u2019s dressing gowns tend to migrate about the flat like housecats looking for a spot to nap. \u201cFine. It\u2019s just that I disagree.\u201d\nJohn laughs, punch-drunk from a heady cocktail of exhaustion infused with relief. \u201cWhat bit do you find disagreeable? The bit where you solved the case, or the bit where you were amazing while you did it? Because neither is really up for debate.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t tire of saying these things, do you?\u201d Sherlock\u2019s back is turned as he peers once more at his laptop, but the grin is clear in his voice.\n\u201cNo, and I don\u2019t mind repeating if you missed any of it, because you saved a man\u2019s life. As I said, amazing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not amazing,\u201d Sherlock says, shutting the laptop with a click. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s mouth twitches. \u201cArgumentative, are we?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a doctor.\u201d Sherlock settles into his armchair opposite John. \u201cYou save people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s what doctors do.\u201d\n\u201cTrue. But there are plenty of doctors with my skills, who can do the same job. There isn\u2019t anyone else who has your skills, as far as I know.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly true.\u201d Sherlock steeples his fingers. \u201cBut irrelevant. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m going out of my way to achieve greatness when I use my skills. I use them because I have no choice.\u201d He pauses. \u201cIf you were walking down the street and a man beside you had a heart attack, you would stop. You would administer first aid. Am I correct?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a set of skills, but it\u2019s also who you are. When presented with an opportunity, you will put your skills to use every time, without question.\u201d Sherlock leans forward. \u201cI can\u2019t help what I do, John. I\u2019m not making a choice. If I have a case, I have to work to solve it. I am not attempting to do the world a favour. I am doing what I do, because I can\u2019t do otherwise.\u201d He gives John a measured look, arches an eyebrow. \u201cEven when there are -- other things to think about.\u201d\nJohn feels a flush warm his cheeks. He quirks an eyebrow in return. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t an apology, was it?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sherlock says, but his eyes crinkle at the corners. \u201cWhy, did you need one?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d John says, half-grinning, and finds it\u2019s entirely true. \u201cDid you?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nThey look at each other, an easy, comfortable beat of silence. The absence of a countdown feels like an outrageous gift. It occurs to John that this is the first moment they\u2019ve had to themselves since things have... shifted, as it were. He should probably be anxious, or preoccupied, or any of the myriad things one should feel when a relationship takes a turn as theirs has, but he finds he can\u2019t be arsed to be nervous. Sitting across from Sherlock feels as natural as it always has. John wants to make tea and take Sherlock to bed and watch crap telly and talk about nothing and sleep for twelve hours all at once. Nothing new, really. It\u2019s just that taking Sherlock to bed is now a possibility rather than a deeply subconscious fantasy.\nHowever, quite a few of these options involve getting up out of his indecently comfortable armchair. And at the moment, a nagging question lingers in the corner of John\u2019s mind. Well, not so much a question, but a vague need to correct. Sherlock is wrong. Considering this is a rare event, John prefers to point it out when it does happen.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your knack, though, Sherlock,\u201d John says.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cYour analogy is off. Your skill isn\u2019t acquired. I don\u2019t doubt that you can\u2019t help using it, but it\u2019s entirely different than being a doctor.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d Sherlock sits up. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you acquire the skill. So many idiots place a distinction on these --\u201d Sherlock gestures with his right hand -- \u201cthese knacks, these \u2018natural-born\u2019 talents. As if it makes a bit of difference. Most knacks are entirely useless, and even if they aren\u2019t, most people are too daft to learn how to properly utilize them anyway. My ability may be natural, but that\u2019s only a small part of it. The rest is working hard enough to use it well, which most people never bother with.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying most people are equal,\u201d John says, \u201cbecause most people are idiots. Except you, of course.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose.\u201d\nJohn takes a moment to absorb this. It seems so like Sherlock to arrive at this conclusion. He raises an eyebrow. \u201cWow. Progressive and offensive.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see, John. You haven\u2019t been to school with them, with these so-called \u2018highly gifted.\u2019 Brainless twits that people like Mycroft pull aside because they need to be controlled, because without proper training, their knacks could cause serious problems. Years of privileged, special schooling, yet almost none of them had enough sense or work ethic to really take advantage of their own talents.\u201d\nThis stops John short. \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, \u2018people like Mycroft?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cMycroft is the leading Analyst in Britain.\u201d Sherlock lifts an eyebrow. \u201cSurely you knew that.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s jaw goes slack. \u201cYou told me he worked for the British government.\u201d\n\u201cHe is the British government,\u201d Sherlock says. \u201cHis ability to detect knacks in others is unsurpassed, or if it is, there hasn\u2019t been a documented case. An ability of his calibre is invaluable to those who work in certain circles.\u201d\n\u201cI thought all Analysts were the same.\u201d\n\u201cMost of them are,\u201d Sherlock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the primary judgemental knack, so it\u2019s not entirely uncommon. But most of those who have it can only detect generalized information about someone else\u2019s knack. The Analysts who saw you in primary school most likely had the natural ability to detect knacks by category only; it\u2019s only via extensive training that Analysts learn to make more detailed judgements.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Mycroft,\u201d John says slowly, \u201cis different?\u201d\n\u201cMycroft can read anyone\u2019s knack instantly, and precisely, with great detail. He has never been wrong.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\nSherlock regards John with perhaps the barest flicker of guilt. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem important.\u201d\nJohn shakes his head slowly and sighs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also highly classified,\u201d Sherlock adds.\n\u201cThat\u2019s never stopped you before,\u201d John says pointedly. He rubs his forehead, attempting to absorb this fairly earth-shattering revelation. He had never presumed to ask about Mycroft\u2019s knack, but assumed it had to be something significant. \u201cDoes this have anything to do with the reason you don\u2019t want to help him?\u201d John takes out his mobile, holds it up. \u201cAnother text from him this afternoon, by the way.\u201d\n\u201cMycroft\u2019s ability has given him some rather objectionable prejudices, but that\u2019s only part of it,\u201d Sherlock says mildly. \u201cPrimarily he\u2019s pompous and insufferable.\u201d\nJohn gives a snort of laughter, but a thought strikes him. \u201cSurely you can do a similar thing,\u201d he says. \u201cDeduce someone\u2019s knack via observation. In fact, I\u2019ve seen you do it.\u201d\nSherlock hums in approval. \u201cIn a sense,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can only make guesses. Good guesses, often, but guesses are quite different than definitive answers. Guesses can be wrong. Mycroft, as far as we know, cannot.\u201d\nPieces fall into place in John\u2019s mind: small pieces, but pieces nonetheless, forming a vague picture. He wonders if this is what Sherlock feels like all the time when he makes a deduction, just on a supernova-sized scale.\n\u201cHe wanted you to be an Analyst,\u201d John says, sitting up. \u201cYou could have done it, with your knack, or at least you could have learned how, done something similar. Followed him into government work.\u201d\nSherlock looks both surprised and pleased. \u201cVery good,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe you\u2019ve just hit upon the cause of many an unpleasant Christmas dinner in the Holmes household.\u201d\n\u201cGod. That explains quite a lot, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMmm.\u201d Sherlock is still watching John; he presses his fingertips together. His gaze has shifted: soft, heated.Oh.\n\u201cSo,\u201d John says, unable to look away, \u201canything else critical or classified you\u2019ve been neglecting to tell me? Your aunt is a Russian double agent? Your second cousin can fly?\u201d\nSherlock chuckles, a delicious sound that sends a shiver of pleasure down John\u2019s spine. \u201cI don\u2019t have any aunts. Or second cousins. Both my parents were only children.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that clears that up, then.\u201d\nThe corner of Sherlock\u2019s mouth twists, but his look doesn\u2019t waver, and his eyes widen, a barely perceptible change. But John knows it by now, even in this subtle form. It\u2019s impossible not to feel a small thrill at the sight of Sherlock\u2019s knack making itself known. John smiles. \u201cAll right, enlighten me. What\u2019s the latest revelation?\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Sherlock says, and there\u2019s a note in his voice that\u2019s equal parts playful and predatory. \u201cYou like it when I talk. You like my voice, specifically.\u201d\nJohn flushes, grins. \u201cHardly rocket science. I think we\u2019ve established I find most of you attractive.\u201d\n\u201cMost?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen everything yet. I reserve the right to make additional judgements later.\u201d\nAnother long, low chuckle. \u201cYou seem confident about future events.\u201d\nJohn tilts his head to study Sherlock, who is watching him from the opposite armchair with knee-weakening intensity. \u201cShould I be?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d The low purr of Sherlock\u2019s voice in its deeper register -- deliberate, John knows now, fiendishly deliberate -- is nearly making him sweat. Sherlock is teasing, drawing this out, the bastard.\nJohn won\u2019t go down without a fight.\nHe plans on enjoying every minute of said fight.\nHe lifts his chin, looks back at Sherlock: a challenge. \u201cGo on, then. Let\u2019s hear the rest. Is there more?\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s eyes widen again, then narrow. \u201cYou want to hear it. What I can see.\u201d\nA quick nod. John leans forward. \u201cDo your worst.\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Sherlock says, and draws the word out like he\u2019s savouring smoke from a cigarette, \u201care used to being in charge. Your past relationships have all been with women who\u2019ve shared similar traits: bright, but conventional. Maybe they like having doors opened for them. They like someone who can take care of them. You, as someone who\u2019s had to assert yourself in life, enjoy assuming this role. You\u2019re accustomed to it.\n\u201cBut in Afghanistan you had an experience with someone else, possibly a man. Someone who took charge. A superior officer, perhaps. Someone who outranked you. You haven\u2019t forgotten it.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s pulse has quickened. \u201cHow did you know about Afghanistan?\u201d\n\u201cYou talk in your sleep sometimes.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s flush intensifies. \u201cOh, God.\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing terribly revealing,\u201d Sherlock says. \u201cMostly nightmares. Although those have become far less frequent in recent months.\u201d\n\u201cHave they?\u201d John murmurs, but he knows the answer. And possibly the reason.\nThe reason is watching him closely. \u201cI can stop.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d John says. His limbs feel molten. This is inevitable, the words spilling from Sherlock\u2019s lips, what will happen afterwards. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou like taking charge,\u201d Sherlock says, after a moment, \u201cbut you\u2019re also a soldier. You like taking orders. It\u2019s a guilty pleasure of yours.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThe shift of power excites you, in either direction.\u201d\n\u201cI would say you should have been a therapist,\u201d John says, \u201cexcept therapists don\u2019t leave after five minutes when a client bores them.\u201d\nThis actually earns a snort of laughter from Sherlock. John grins.\n\u201cYour hands.\u201d Sherlock looks, pointedly. John\u2019s hands are perched on the arms of his chair, and he flexes his fingers self-consciously. \u201cYour hands are particularly sensitive.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s heart thuds, hard, and he\u2019s suddenly aware that his jeans feel tight. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d\n\u201cWould you like me to demonstrate?\u201d\nThe look in Sherlock\u2019s eyes short-circuits most of John\u2019s rational thoughts and a large percentage of his irrational ones as well. He can only nod.\nIn one fluid motion Sherlock is on his knees in front of John, against John\u2019s armchair. He takes John\u2019s left hand and pulls John forward gently, bringing John\u2019s hand almost, but not quite, to his lips. John almost loses it. It\u2019s a very near thing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re particularly conscious of your hands,\u201d Sherlock says, in the dark depths of his baritone. His breath ghosts over the back of John\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve learned to mask your dominant hand as needed. You wear your watch on your left hand, like a right-handed person would. You\u2019ve trained yourself to keep your wallet in your back right pocket and pull out notes with your right hand instead of your left, when the reverse would be far easier. You\u2019re aware of others looking at your hands almost all the time. This constant low-level awareness is likely to make your hands more sensitive when touched.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Christ,\u201d John says, grasps Sherlock by the collar of his dressing gown, and hauls him up straight through several levels of foreplay and into a rough, desperately messy kiss.\nSherlock makes a startled noise that dissolves against John\u2019s mouth; then he laughs, deep in his chest, still kissing John and nearly collapsing into the armchair in the process. In a moment Sherlock\u2019s hands seek John\u2019s arms and swiftly pull John up and out of the chair. They both overcompensate for balance and almost tumble backwards.\n\u201cBed,\u201d John gasps, half-laughing, and tries to drag Sherlock in the right direction, Sherlock\u2019s hands and limbs seemingly everywhere at once.\n\u201cI was going to show you,\u201d Sherlock says breathlessly, and more than a bit petulantly. They nearly chase each other through the kitchen. \u201cYou didn\u2019t let me show you.\u201d\n\u201cYou can bloody well show me in here.\u201d Bedroom at last, lit by a single lamp at Sherlock\u2019s bedside. John wrests off his jumper and tosses it on the floor. Sherlock watches him, pale eyes blown dark. He strips off his dressing gown and starts unbuttoning his shirt. John swallows.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t wrong, though,\u201d Sherlock says.\nJohn\u2019s fingers fumble with his own buttons. Shirt, jeans and pants hit the floor, and yes, this is apparently happening, the two of them shedding layers with unwavering haste. \u201cNo,\u201d John says, stepping forward as Sherlock\u2019s trousers and pants slide onto the floor next to his jeans. He pulls Sherlock\u2019s narrow hips towards his own, distantly wondering at his own audacity, at the not-strangeness of touching Sherlock like this. \u201cVery much not wrong. You need to be careful -- oh God --\u201d as Sherlock bends to kiss his neck, his shoulder -- \u201chow you use that knack.\u201d\n\u201cCareful?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019d prefer not to wash my jeans more often than necessary.\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s response is merely a wicked rumble of laughter. He steps them backward, once, until John\u2019s knees hit the edge of the mattress, and they collapse onto the bed. This, finally, is what John needs: Sherlock before him, sprawling and naked, smooth, strong, hard everywhere. Before John can fully appreciate this glorious state of affairs, Sherlock rolls to face him and captures John\u2019s left hand, blotting out all sound and vision as he draws John\u2019s index finger into his mouth.\nBright flashes pop against the back of John\u2019s eyelids and he gasps, utterly disarmed, shivers of pleasure rocketing scalp to toes. Sherlock withdraws John\u2019s finger from his mouth, his large hand still caging John\u2019s. He draws in the next finger, edging closer until they are hip to hip, but not yet touching.\n\u201cJesus --\u201d\nSherlock slides John\u2019s middle finger out of his mouth, runs his tongue along the edge of the next. He looks fiendishly smug. \u201cNo one\u2019s done this?\u201d\nJohn\u2019s response does not evolve beyond writhing and groaning. Sherlock\u2019s tongue swirls over the rough pads of each of John\u2019s fingers in turn, his ministrations shifting from precise to haphazard. John is dimly aware that Sherlock himself is coming unhinged, John\u2019s helpless arousal chipping away at Sherlock\u2019s usually impenetrable control. John, for his part, is very nearly shaking, which he tries desperately to conceal until he realises with a start that Sherlock is shaking too, even as he draws the last of John\u2019s fingers into the oblivion of his mouth. Sherlock is shaking. Fucking hell.\nAn indeterminate amount of time later, an authoritative hand releases John\u2019s right wrist and presses John\u2019s shoulder against the mattress: stay here. John lies back on Sherlock\u2019s sheets, eyes shut and heart hammering, his hands slick and wet, erection hard enough to be painful. Then a hand grasps his hipbone, the sole warning before Sherlock\u2019s mouth closes around John\u2019s cock in precisely the same way it closed around his fingers. John breathes a stream of utterly senseless profanity into the semi-darkness and wonders what he\u2019s done in life to deserve this.\nSherlock pulls off, briefly, to gloat: \u201cThis is what you like.\u201d\nIt is a statement, nowhere near a question. His lips close around John again. John babbles, incoherent. He\u2019s fairly sure one of the words is \u201cYes.\u201d\nReality blurs into breathless overload, and there is only Sherlock, Sherlock\u2019s clever, clever mouth, his clever hands that know what John wants before John even knows it himself. When John finally comes, sparks behind his eyes, trailing down his spine, clutching handfuls of Sherlock\u2019s crisp sheets, he shouts, and he is never loud when he comes, never. But this is different.\nAt last Sherlock crawls up the length of John, kissing his mouth, tasting of John, flushed with desire and inordinately pleased with himself. His own hard cock presses insistently against John\u2019s side, and John\u2019s hand closes around it.\n\u201cYou next, you brilliant bastard,\u201d John breathes, and Sherlock melts underneath him.\n* * *\nSomeone\u2019s phone chirps. As usual.\nJohn drifts blearily into consciousness. He\u2019s warm, maybe slightly too warm, and it takes him a moment to realize that it\u2019s because his best friend is draped around him. Sherlock\u2019s long arm curls around John\u2019s midsection, and John finds he\u2019s enfolded rather neatly in a cocoon of pale, long limbs.\nSherlock\u2019s bed. With Sherlock in it.\nJohn is sure he\u2019s going to feel strongly about this in some way, once he remembers a bit of context.\nTwo phones rest on the end table next to John: the pink phone, and Sherlock\u2019s own mobile. One of them is making noise, but John can\u2019t tell which.\nThe sum total of yesterday washes over John in fractured flashes. The countdown, the car, Ian Monkford. And then, last night: the relentless clock, stopped.\nAnd Sherlock.\nSherlock shifts, and then in a single motion his arm snakes out over John to snag one of the phones from the end table. John is suddenly wrenchingly, painfully awake. Army-ready.\nSherlock switches off the phone\u2019s sound with a practised flick of his thumb and drops it back onto the table. His arm tentatively slides back around John, warm fingertips seeking John\u2019s chest, John\u2019s hipbone.\n\u201cNot the pink phone?\u201d John whispers, voice drawn tight.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s voice rumbles with sleep. \u201cMine. It\u2019s Mycroft. Bastard.\u201d\n\u201cMycroft.\u201d Tension ebbs from John\u2019s limbs. No countdown. No bloody awful countdown. Only the warm yellow morning light shifting through Sherlock\u2019s window, and Sherlock\u2019s solid, wiry form against him, which is frankly closer to perfect bliss than John is able to admit.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d John says, and shuts his eyes. He feels his own breathing deepen: relief. At ease.\nSherlock\u2019s fingers play gently on John\u2019s hipbone. Gradually they still, then vanish. A cold, absent spot lingers on John\u2019s skin where they once were. John feels Sherlock roll to the side, disengaging. The cold spot spreads, aches.\n\u201cSherlock?\u201d John murmurs.\nSilence.\nJohn rolls over, opens his eyes. Sherlock is staring up at the ceiling. His jaw is clenched.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d\nSherlock takes a breath. Speaking seems to take effort; the words come out sharply, fragments of thought.\n\u201cYou make me feel --\u201d he says, and stops. Shuts his eyes. \u201cDifferent.\u201d\nAfter a moment it\u2019s clear Sherlock can\u2019t find any other words.\nJohn waits.\n\u201cDifferent good?\u201d John says quietly.\nSherlock opens his eyes again, shifts onto his side to look at John. He looks anxious, intent. \u201cYes,\u201d he says gravely. \u201cI think so. Being with you -- it\u2019s different than being with anyone else.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBetter.\u201d\nJohn dares a small smile. His heart beats somewhere in his throat. \u201cI think... I know what you mean.\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s forehead creases. \u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cFrankly,\u201d John says, \u201cit\u2019s bloody terrifying.\u201d\nThis earns a twitch of smile in return. Sherlock\u2019s expression is endearingly grave, a line between his brows. More silence.\nA small but vocal part of John\u2019s brain is telling him that this is bad, this is certainly dangerous, that he\u2019s falling hard, has already fallen hard, that this is far more intense than he\u2019s able to handle.\nThat part is drowned out by the look in Sherlock\u2019s eyes, and the resulting rush of affection that swells into John\u2019s chest and catches his breath against the tight walls of his ribcage.\nJohn reaches out and runs a finger along Sherlock\u2019s clenched jaw. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he says.\nSherlock swallows. His hand comes up reflexively, captures John\u2019s.\nJohn\u2019s stomach chooses this moment to rumble loudly.\nSherlock chuckles, releases John\u2019s hand, and reaches for John\u2019s waist, drawing them closer. \u201cIt would seem that your stomach disagrees.\u201d\nJohn relaxes into Sherlock\u2019s embrace, feeling the tightness dissipate from his chest. He sighs good-naturedly as Sherlock runs a hand lightly down his side, over his belly. \u201cMy stomach often disagrees with you.\u201d\n\u201cIt can be quite demanding.\u201d\n\u201cSays the man who believes eating is unnecessary for survival.\u201d\n\u201cTedious.\u201d Sherlock grins. He looks ridiculously young this way, dark curls mussed with sleep, eyes soft without their usual razor-edged gleam. John\u2019s thumb traces circles over Sherlock\u2019s bare chest, sweeping over the too-deep ridges between Sherlock\u2019s ribs. He feels the unexpected impulse to close himself around Sherlock, to shut out the world from the both of them, to keep Sherlock like this always, open and naked. All to himself.\nJohn\u2019s thumb finds the edge of Sherlock\u2019s ribcage, the concavity of the space underneath. Evidence of a mind at work without heed for its hungry shell. Sherlock, you idiot, he thinks. \u201cI\u2019m getting up,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to see your brother without you, so he\u2019ll leave us alone. And you are going to go back to sleep, if you can, and then you\u2019re going to eat something before the bomber phones again. No arguments.\u201d\nSherlock looks amused, and briefly looks as if he\u2019s about to protest, but John shuts him up with an insistent kiss. They pull apart a minute later, breathless.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to know if you don\u2019t eat,\u201d John says, tapping one of Sherlock\u2019s ribs.\n\u201cThat observant, are you?\u201d\nJohn disengages and sits up somewhat reluctantly. \u201cI learned from the best.\u201d\nSherlock raises himself up on one elbow. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to bother with Mycroft,\u201d he says, and his eyes are still soft, but his expression sharpens. \u201cHe has most of the nation\u2019s covert intelligence force at his disposal.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not texting any of them and interrupting their sleep.\u201d John pulls on pants, trousers.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d\nJohn huffs a laugh, pulls on his t-shirt. It\u2019s agonizing. Sherlock is still naked, wrapped in sheets, deep lines of hipbones disappearing into folds of white cotton. John wants nothing more than to settle back against those sheets and spend at least three more hours trying to make Sherlock shout loudly enough to worry Mrs Hudson.\nBut he can help, this morning. He can do this. This one thing, for Sherlock, before the bomber calls, before Sherlock\u2019s mind is wrenched away and he refuses food or rest until the clock is stopped again.\n\u201cSleep. Eat. Call me if the pink phone goes off,\u201d John says.\n\u201cYes, Doctor.\u201d Sherlock quirks an impudent smile and settles back against his pillow in mock obedience.\nJohn gathers up his jumper, pauses at the door. Sherlock flips over and draws the sheets up to his shoulder.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d John says.\n\u201cYou eat something too,\u201d Sherlock murmurs, and John smiles.\n* * *\nJohn\u2019s tie is awkward.\nHis tie is awkward, and his jacket is awkward, and Mycroft\u2019s office may be the most uncomfortable room on the planet. Or it could simply be that Mycroft has the power to make any space vastly uncomfortable by his mere presence.\n\u201cAh, John,\u201d Mycroft says, his mouth flicking upward in an approximation of a smile. It\u2019s perhaps what a smile would be if it was held up against a wall and forced to plead for its life.\n\u201cMycroft,\u201d John says. He offers a hand as Mycroft stalks past. Mycroft either doesn\u2019t notice, or prefers not to acknowledge. John suspects the latter. He tries not to jump to conclusions about the reason and fails.\n\u201cHow kind of Sherlock to send you along.\u201d Mycroft sits, motions for John to do the same.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t send me.\u201d John sits. His own attempt at a pleasant smile fails as miserably as Mycroft\u2019s.\n\u201cNo?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m looking into this case. Sherlock is...\u201d Sleeping, hopefully. \u201c...occupied.\u201d\n\u201cIs he now,\u201d Mycroft says, arching an angled eyebrow, and in his look John can see that same all-knowing scan Sherlock uses, the one that can determine where John was last night, what he had for breakfast, and exactly how many times John shagged his brother.\nJohn suddenly feels more than a bit triumphant. He lifts his chin, meets Mycroft\u2019s gaze with a tight smile. \u201cI don\u2019t think he slept very well last night,\u201d he says.\nMycroft\u2019s eyes widen very slightly, and his false grin widens even more. \u201cWell,\u201d he says, and the words drip with something slick. \u201cYou are his doctor.\u201d\nThey stare at each other through a beat of silence, during which John thinks of all the ways he could allude to exactly the type of treatment he\u2019d like to give Sherlock when he gets home.\n\u201cIf you could just tell me about the Andrew West case,\u201d John says instead. \u201cSorry. Bit of a tight schedule.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Mycroft pins John with his gaze. \u201cI realise you must be pressed for time, what with the mad bomber still at large. Between bombs, are you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not at liberty to say.\u201d This is utter bullshit; they both know Mycroft has access to any and all Scotland Yard information at all times. John says it anyway.\nMycroft\u2019s grin fades slightly. \u201cJohn, I believe we\u2019ve gotten off on rather the wrong foot.\u201d\nChrist. John feigns ignorance. \u201cSorry? I\u2019m not sure what you mean.\u201d\n\u201cSherlock has taken offence to some of the things I\u2019ve said about you in the past. He\u2019s been quite incorrect in his interpretation of my intentions. He does take offence so easily. I do want to apologise.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I know what you mean.\u201d At this moment John is desperately trying to remember why he\u2019d thought it was a good idea to visit Mycroft at all.\n\u201cThe other day, I referred to you as \u2018remarkable.\u2019 Sherlock thought I was being patronising. I want to assure you, I did not mean to imply anything of the kind.\u201d He folds his hands on the desk. \u201cJohn, you know what I do.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Yes, Sherlock\u2019s said.\u201d\n\u201cI thought he might have. I\u2019m not sure if he has also mentioned that you are somewhat of an anomaly in my line of work. I find you remarkable for that reason.\u201d\nJohn stares. \u201cNo,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say.\u201d\n\u201cWithout detailing technicalities,\u201d Mycroft says, and John can tell that he\u2019s pleased, that he\u2019s intending to needle Sherlock by offering up this bit of information, \u201cI always get a clear analysis on left-handed individuals. But you are more difficult to read than most.\u201d\nJohn has been tested enough times to know that no Analyst has ever found anything remotely unusual about him at all. He tries to school the skepticism from his expression. \u201cIs that so.\u201d\n\u201cQuite fascinating,\u201d Mycroft says. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Sherlock thinks so as well.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I... thanks for letting me know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised Sherlock hasn\u2019t mentioned it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure if it was important, Sherlock would have said something,\u201d John says, a bit more curtly than he\u2019d intended.\nMycroft\u2019s look turns sour for the half-second before he manages to smooth it into a veneer of false approval. \u201cQuite right,\u201d he says dismissively, and shuffles the papers on his desk. \u201cNow. Andrew West.\u201d\nThe train tracks at Battersea Station stubbornly refuse to divulge any secrets about the mystery of Andrew West\u2019s death. The morning is bright and sunny, but very cold; John has been wandering the tracks for at least a half-hour, not entirely sure what he might be looking for. The station workers have been pleasant enough, but entirely unhelpful. Apparently it\u2019s possible to die a violent death at a trainyard without anyone knowing anything about it.\nThe manila folder with Andrew West\u2019s classified information weighs awkwardly in his jacket. West\u2019s body was found here, without a train ticket -- but he had to have been on the train. There is a surprising lack of blood on the tracks, which should mean something, but John\u2019s not entirely sure what. Disparate pieces, drifting without a framework. Off the track, as it were.\nJohn paces across the stretch of track where the corpse was found. Sherlock would see something here -- hell, Sherlock would see everything. But John should be able to do this. He\u2019s watched Sherlock closely, closer than anyone. He knows what Sherlock does.\nBut doing it himself is something else entirely.\nJohn kneels down, bidding the cold metal to reveal something. Anything. The rails chime loudly, points shifting from one line to another.\n\u201cAndrew West wasn\u2019t killed here,\u201d says a familiar baritone at John\u2019s shoulder, and John jumps. \u201cToo little blood.\u201d\nSherlock is standing behind him, coat blooming in the wind.\nJohn straightens. \u201cPink phone? New message?\u201d he says tersely.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d\n\u201cSince the start,\u201d Sherlock says, and he almost looks abashed.\nJohn raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be sleeping,\u201d he says, and Sherlock steps closer. \u201cAnd eating.\u201d\n\u201cDone and done.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s eyes look heated in a way John has seen in Sherlock\u2019s bedroom, but never while they\u2019re on a case. His breath fogs between them in the cold; his nose and cheeks are tinged pink. In the overbright winter light his eyes are very, very blue.\n\u201cAnd you are aware that the definition of \u2018eating\u2019 involves consuming food. Possibly until no longer hungry.\u201d John tilts his head up as Sherlock steps even closer.\n\u201cMm. Yes.\u201d Sherlock steps in so he\u2019s standing almost behind John. They\u2019re nearly touching, but not quite. John\u2019s heart pounds. Here, on the tracks. On a case. Christ.\nSherlock\u2019s gloved fingers lift the edge of John\u2019s jacket, and he leans in: a low, smoky whisper in John\u2019s ear. Chills.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be needing this,\u201d he says, and John feels something cold, something heavy, slide into his waistband, under his jacket. Something familiar.\nGod. John shudders a breath; he almost can\u2019t move. He swallows, hard. He wills other parts of his body not to be quite so hard.\n\u201cBastard,\u201d he says under his breath as Sherlock\u2019s hands leave him, and Sherlock rumbles a laugh, stepping away. Sherlock knows what he can do to John. Infuriating.\nWonderful.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Sherlock says, tilting his head back toward the station. His eyes are bright, teasing. John shakes his head, jogs into step next to him, shoves his hands into his pockets, and if, for a moment, he is perfectly happy, he never quite believes it.\n* * *\nIt plays out like a dream.\nSherlock\u2019s known, all along, where they need to go for the West case. John bites down on any annoyance about this, because he made up his own mind to go see Mycroft, but still: Sherlock let him go see Mycroft anyway. And probably enjoyed it.\nHowever, Sherlock\u2019s hand has strayed to the small of John\u2019s back as they jog up the stairs to Sherlock\u2019s targeted brick townhouse, and John is willing to forgive him most anything at the moment.\nSherlock picks the lock as John swears under his breath, pulse pounding. Their footfalls rebound in the stairwell, the flat steeped in a quiet that\u2019s broken only by the rattle of trains on the nearby track. Dust sifts through the shafted light at the window like desert sand.\n\u201cJoe Harrison\u2019s flat,\u201d Sherlock supplies in an answer to John\u2019s silent question, and slides open the window shades. A train roars past below the window. \u201cBrother of West\u2019s fiance. He stole the memory stick; killed his prospective brother-in-law.\u201d He kneels down, takes out his magnifying glass, his dark form silhouetted in shifting dust particles. John leans in, fingers brushing Sherlock\u2019s coat.\n\u201cWhy\u2019d he do it?\u201d\nBlood, on the sill. Bright sun; sand, and blood. Metal at his back.\nA noise, downstairs. Key turning in the lock. Door opening.\n\u201cLet\u2019s ask him,\u201d Sherlock murmurs, and it\u2019s an echo from another place. Time to move out. North.\nJohn\u2019s hand gropes for his gun, steady, quiet. He is a soldier: his hands don\u2019t shake, not now. The back of his neck crawls.\nHe steps into the hallway and the man at the bottom of the stairs looks up. He\u2019s holding a bike; he sees John, and his eyes flash with panic, understanding. He makes a move as if to hurl the bike up the stairs, but John is faster.\nHe pulls his gun.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d John says, between gritted teeth. The word tastes of sand. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\nBehind him, John hears Sherlock gasp.\n\u201cPut it down,\u201d John instructs, and the man -- Joe Harrison -- complies. \u201cInside, please.\u201d\n\u201cJohn,\u201d Sherlock says, and his voice is weighted with such intense urgency that John feels his chest constrict.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he hisses, motioning with his gun. Joe Harrison hurries obediently into the flat, glancing at both of them with poorly concealed trepidation. Something\u2019s wrong, John thinks, the bitter taste of adrenaline under his tongue. The pink phone, maybe. The pink phone in Sherlock\u2019s pocket, it\u2019s just gone off --\nJoe sits down on the sofa in his flat, jaw set in apprehension. John chances a glance at Sherlock.\nSherlock isn\u2019t looking at Joe. At all. He is staring, instead, at John. Sherlock\u2019s eyes are impossibly round, blown open with shock.\nJohn stares back in panic. \"Sherlock?\"\n\"Look at your hand.\" Sherlock's deep whisper is shot through with disbelief.\n\"What?\"\n\"John. The gun in your hand. Look at it.\"\nJohn glances down, expecting blood; a missing digit, maybe. But it's just his hand, steady, wrapped comfortably around the gun's handle as always, his hand --\n\"You have a knack,\" Sherlock says slowly. \"You have one, and you've just used it, and that's why -- that's why I've figured out you have one.\"\nJohn goggles at him.\n\"You're aware,\" John says, his ears ringing oddly, \"that this is a really rotten time to be having a go at my expense, right, Sherlock?\"\n\u201cI\u2019m not having a go,\" Sherlock snaps.\n\"I've been tested by experts.\u201d John\u2019s voice cracks. \u201cI've been evaluated since I was six bloody years old. I'm left-handed, Sherlock, and maybe you wish I wasn't, but I've learned to accept it, and I have no idea why you'd say something so utterly ridiculous--\u201d\nJoe Harrison clears his throat.\nSherlock shoots a withering glance at the man on the couch. \u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Joe mutters, and looks down at his shoes.\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying I have a knack,\u201d John says, \u201cand all I\u2019ve done is pull a gun on this guy.\u201d He gestures at Joe, who shifts uncomfortably; John\u2019s gun is still trained on his chest. \u201cI\u2019m remarkably talented at fending off bicycle attacks, is that it? \u2018Oh, look out for John Watson, don\u2019t try to corner him with a bicycle if you know what\u2019s good for you --\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWhat hand do you shoot with?\u201d Sherlock interrupts. \u201cAnswer quickly. What hand?\u201d\n\u201cLeft,\u201d John says automatically, and suddenly his own body feels strange, a mirror image of itself.\n\u201cLook at your gun again.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s voice is steel.\nJohn looks. His right. He\u2019s pulled his Sig right-handed, even though it would have been easier to pull it left-handed.\nJohn lowers the gun, turns his hand over and back again. It\u2019s his own hand. It feels wrong.\n\u201cI shot the cabbie right-handed,\u201d he says quietly.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sherlock says.\nThere\u2019s a long moment of silence. Another train rattles by. John\u2019s shoulder twinges, a stab of heat.\n\u201cYou guys aren\u2019t the police, are you?\u201d\n\u201cOh, God.\u201d Sherlock rolls his eyes, addresses the man on the couch; his words tumble after each other, a machine-gun barrage. \u201cJoe Harrison, sometime bike messenger, small-time drug dealer. Having money trouble, no doubt -- drug trade debt of some kind? You knew about your brother-in-law\u2019s job, heard about the memory stick somehow. Thought you\u2019d lift it, try to sell it, maybe it would solve your money problems, maybe it would get some of your enemies off your back. Only Andrew West found out about it, didn\u2019t he? Came back here to confront you. I\u2019m guessing there was a fight, some kind of scuffle. West fell down the stairs, given the scuff marks on the paint in the stairwell. On purpose, or by accident?\u201d\nJoe is staring at Sherlock open-mouthed. \u201cAccident,\u201d he whispers.\nJohn feels his own jaw slacken in astonishment.\n\u201cHow did he --\u201d John\u2019s brain is working half-speed, utterly failing to absorb an overload of information in much the way a kitchen sponge would fail to absorb the English Channel.\n\u201cI\u2019m texting Lestrade.\u201d Sherlock has his phone in hand. \u201cDo we have to go over this right now? There are more important --\u201d\n\u201cThe body,\u201d John interrupts. \u201cAt Battersea.\u201d\nSherlock stares at him with a mix of wonderment and fury. He steps back, flings the curtain of the living room window aside. \u201cBlood, here at the window. Body dragged through. A train pulls up in front of the awning below the window. Body dragged onto the train. Don\u2019t be an idiot, John.\u201d\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Joe mutters. His face has gone slightly grey.\n\u201cYou can expect a visit from Scotland Yard\u2019s finest in a few minutes,\u201d Sherlock says, an afterthought. He\u2019s still staring at John. \u201cWe\u2019ll be needing the memory stick, if you still have it. You may want to change out of your cycling shoes.\u201d\nJoe continues to gape at Sherlock. He stands up slowly, backs toward the lone bedroom of the flat.\n\u201cDo what he says,\u201d John says weakly. His gun is still in his hand, forgotten. He slips it back into the waistband of his jeans, under his jacket.\nJoe nods numbly, disappears. They can hear him rummaging in the closet.\n\u201cI have a knack, then,\u201d John says, after a moment.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m almost forty,\u201d John says, \u201cand I\u2019m left-handed, and I have a knack that I\u2019ve never known about, and no one else has ever discovered it.\u201d\n\u201cIt would seem so.\u201d\nJohn rubs the back of his neck; it\u2019s tingling, nerves aflame. \u201cAre you planning on telling me what it is?\u201d\n\u201cObviously.\u201d\nJohn waits. His heart beats an unsteady rhythm. Sherlock says nothing. They can hear the creak of mattress springs in the bedroom: Joe Harrison, changing his shoes.\n\u201cAt some point this year?\u201d John says, eventually.\n\u201cOur knacks work together, they worked together just now, and because of that, I can see what yours is,\u201d Sherlock says, low and quiet, as if this should mean something.\nJohn waits to understand. When he doesn\u2019t, he closes his eyes. His head starts to hurt. \u201cOur knacks work together,\u201d he echoes. Nonsense. The words still mean nothing.\nHe feels Sherlock step closer, feels the warm wool of Sherlock\u2019s coat at his back, the sweep of it behind him. A long, gloved hand on his shoulder closes into a firm grip, as if attempting to hold John together. Sherlock's touch grounds him, keeping panic at bay. John didn't know it was possible for Sherlock to ground anybody.\nNext to him, Sherlock is thrumming with energy, his entire body tensed with the excess. John opens his eyes. Sherlock is still scrutinising him, a fierce, half-wondering look.\n\u201cWe can leave when Lestrade arrives,\u201d Sherlock says under his breath. \u201cI\u2019ll explain then.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d John says, and it takes all of his restraint not to lean into Sherlock, let Sherlock take his weight. His hand curls into a fist, uncurls, flexes; he\u2019s not sure which one.\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Sherlock murmurs.\n* * *\nThe cab ride home is quiet. They shuffle upstairs, habitual, tense. Coats on hooks. Sherlock closes the flat doors, striding from kitchen to living room, all motion and unrest.\nJohn doesn't know where to go. He stands, unsure, in front of his usual armchair. His brain shouts a hundred things at once, and none of them make much sense. Sherlock has been known to flirt with the edge of insanity, but never where facts are concerned. And yet Sherlock thinks John has a knack, which seems certifiably insane. John, who is absolutely, unequivocally ordinary, and absolutely, definitely left-handed.\nSherlock paces in front of the fireplace, fingertips steepled, shoulders hunched. He doesn't wait for John to speak.\n\u201cYou have questions.\u201d\n\u201cBloody well right I have questions.\u201d In the absence of any understanding whatsoever, John\u2019s confusion rapidly shifts to anger. \u201cWere you planning on telling me why the hell you made some wild claim about me having a knack? Were you hoping to get Joe Harrison to reveal some vital bit of information? Because I really don\u2019t see the point of making a claim like that in front of a murder suspect.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot.\u201d Sherlock bites down on the last syllable. He stops to face John, his eyes hard. \u201cFirst of all, he\u2019s a murderer, not a murder suspect. Secondly, it\u2019s a fact, not a claim.\u201d\n\u201cThen why won\u2019t you tell me what the fuck you\u2019re talking about?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m trying--\u201d Sherlock says, and his hands clench in frustration, gesturing-- \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to explain. I\u2019m still working out the details.\u201d\nJohn crosses his arms. \u201cImagining, for a moment, that you\u2019re right, that I do have... something. It\u2019s my knack, is it not?\u201d he says, and the words feel foreign in his mouth. My knack. \u201cWhy should you need to work out the details? It shouldn\u2019t affect you at all.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Sherlock says, and the corner of his mouth tilts; the ghost of a smile.\n\u201cI swear to God, Sherlock,\u201d John begins, between gritted teeth, but Sherlock\u2019s hands grip his shoulders firmly, willing him into silence.\n\u201cYour knack does affect me. That\u2019s the key. It doesn\u2019t affect you directly, John. But it does affect everyone around you. You're a... catalyst. A conductor, a -- conductor of light.\"\n\u201cA conductor of what?\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s grip tightens. Their eyes lock, gravid, electric. \u201cSimply put,\u201d he says, \u201cyour knack amplifies the knacks of others.\u201d\nIt feels like someone might be drunk. Most likely John, although John can\u2019t be entirely sure. The edges of the flat seem to be tilting, collapsing in on themselves, blurring the corners of John\u2019s field of vision.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me,\u201d Sherlock says.\n\u201cWhy should I believe you? What proof could you possibly have, Sherlock? How is this anything other than a colossal joke at my expense?\u201d\nSherlock drops his hands, steps back, eyes cold. \u201cWhy would I lie to you?\u201d\nA jolt of guilt, uncertainty. \u201cI don\u2019t know. None of this makes any sense.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t test this in a lab,\u201d Sherlock says darkly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a quantifiable condition. Knacks don\u2019t work that way. You know that.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d John says dryly. \u201cGo on, then. I\u2019m listening. I somehow enhance the abilities of everyone I encounter. You\u2019re sure it\u2019s not just my sparkling personality?\u201d\nThis earns John an impatient glance. Sherlock takes a breath. \u201cNot your sparkling personality, no. There are several factors which, taken together, point to this type of knack as the only logical conclusion.\u201d He resumes pacing. \u201cMycroft, for one.\u201d\n\u201cMycroft told me he saw me differently,\u201d John says, and his stomach twists uneasily. \u201cYou never mentioned it before.\u201d\n\u201cMycroft assured me it meant nothing. But he usually gets a clear reading on left-handed individuals during Analysis, a solid indication that no knack is present. But when he first met you -- no reading. Nothing. It rattled him a bit, I think. He said it hadn't happened before. He chalked it up to your being Left, of course, figured it was just an anomaly, because he didn\u2019t sense an unclassified knack at all. But -- he didn't sense the absence of one, either, at least not in the usual way.\u201d\n\"So you've been -- looking for something?\" John\u2019s voice is strained. \"Since I moved in, you've been watching me? Because of what your brother said?\"\nSherlock gives John a swift, fierce look. \"It seemed like an anomaly worth investigating.\"\n\"Right.\" John feels anger crackle up the base of his spine. His face is hot. \"Specimen in a zoo, am I? There's a far better zoo just up the road in Regent's Park, it's not far--\"\"Shut up.\" Sherlock steps dangerously close. His voice hits a low, dark register. \"I'm trying to tell you that you've got a powerful knack, one that's possibly unique in the world. You can listen, or you can ignore the facts in front of your nose. It\u2019s entirely your choice. But this is real, John. Quite real. I'm sure of it.\"\nThey look at each other for a moment. The flat is nearly dark, save the dim light from a single lamp by the sofa. Sherlock is half in shadow, his breathing quick, hands on hips.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d John says, because it seems like someone should say it.\nSherlock says nothing.\n\u201cYou really believe this.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s thoughts wheel inward, bullets, grenades. Sherlock\u2019s words, like a sniper from a distance, shattering bone and tendon and muscle. Something is spreading through him, sickening and real, a rush of blood beating from a wound. An idea.\n\u201cWhen you shot the cabbie, when we first met,\u201d Sherlock says, falling into the rhythm of deduction, watching John closely. \u201cYou washed your hands, but I spotted faint traces of powder residue on your right hand nonetheless. I noted it at the time, but since then, you\u2019ve always carried your gun as a left-handed marksman would. Left-handed marksman choosing to take a highly difficult shot with his right hand? There has to be a reason. Conclusion: a latent knack, or some other rare knack-related anomaly. But your records show you had been tested quite extensively, always with negative results.\u201d\n\u201cYou pulled my records?\u201d\nSherlock waves a hand. \u201cNot important.\u201d\n\u201cSherlock --\u201d\nSherlock ignores him. \u201cHave you noticed that other people seem to do their best work in your presence?\u201d\nJohn tries to swallow a fresh wave of anger. \u201cI -- I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cI solve cases faster when you\u2019re with me.\u201d\nJohn is grappling, feeling for stable ground. There isn\u2019t any. \u201cI thought you liked having someone to talk to.\u201d\n\u201cThis is different. Sometimes it used to take me days at a crime scene.\u201d For a moment, Sherlock looks almost shy, reticent. \u201cIt feels different, with you.\u201d\n\u201cIt feels different.\u201d An echo. Sherlock\u2019s words, rebounding. You make me feel... different.\nBut Sherlock has resumed pacing, hands underlining the air. \u201cSome people have subtle physical symptoms when their knacks activate. Pupil dilation, muscle spasms, alterations in their breathing patterns. Part of the education given to right-handed children in primary school involves becoming aware of these symptoms, learning to recognize activation so it can potentially be controlled if at all possible. It manifests differently in different individuals.\u201d A pointed look. \u201cChills. Twinges. Could be anything. I\u2019m sure you could recognise mine.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d This is first-year med school stuff, really; John never fathomed it might apply to him. Why would it apply to him? He feels numb.\n\u201cYou have some of these symptoms,\u201d Sherlock says. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed. But I could never link it to a particular event. Not until now.\u201d\n\u201cYour knack went off at the flat,\u201d John says, recalling Sherlock\u2019s gasp behind him, that gasp as John pulled his gun on Joe Harrison. \u201c...Because of mine.\u201d\n\u201cI believe when your knack activates under pressure, your right hand temporarily dominates. You pulled your gun right-handed at Joe Harrison\u2019s flat and my knack immediately went off.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what caused you to figure this out. I -- I enhanced your deduction. About my own knack.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cChrist.\u201d\nThey stare at each other for a moment. They\u2019ve been pacing, distracted, tracing aimless patterns across the worn rug. Sherlock\u2019s eyes are alight; he nearly grins at John, but seems to think better of it. The grin plays at the corner of his mouth nonetheless.\n\u201cSo if this is real,\u201d John says flatly, \u201cand you\u2019re right about everything, that means my knack has affected everyone around me for years.\u201d\nSherlock is watching John with much the same look a botanist would give a particularly rare orchid. \u201cTheoretically, yes.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone. Everyone in my life.\u201d\n\u201cWell, not necessarily. That would be impossible to prove. But I believe we can assume that it has been acting in some capacity since birth, without your knowledge.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s feet have found the back of his armchair, and he stops, leans against it. Everything is pulling inwards, a weight crushing air from his chest. His voice is tight with the force of it. \u201cAnd how am I supposed to deal with that, exactly? Explain that to me, would you?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you need to deal with any of it?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how it\u2019s affected your past, John, what matters is using this to our advantage in the future.\u201d Sherlock faces him, clearly trying to contain his glee; his hands flutter into motion, fluid gestures of thought. \u201cThis is beautiful -- it\u2019s brilliant. Don\u2019t you see, John? Two knacks in near-symbiosis, one triggering the other --\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, it doesn\u2019t matter?\u201d John grips the back of the chair, white-knuckled. \u201cWhat if -- what if I caused accidents without knowing? Who knows what I\u2019ve done? What if...oh, God.\u201d He shuts his eyes.\nHe is six years old, playing in the front yard, dragging a stick along an old stone wall. \u201cJohn,\u201d says Harry\u2019s voice, and she\u2019s at his elbow, cajoling. \u201cJohn, come with me. Something\u2019s happening down Tithe Barn Road, I need you to come. We\u2019ll find it if you come.\u201d\u201cHarry, you know we can\u2019t--\u201d\n\u201cJohn. Just this once.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s always just this once.\u201d\n\u201cC\u2019mon, John --\u201d\n\u201cHarry,\u201d he says slowly, and his past is rearranging itself, fitting into a pattern so vast he can\u2019t believe it wasn\u2019t there before. \u201cHarry\u2019s knack is always much worse when she\u2019s with me, I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t stay with her, or visit her, she\u2019s just impossible. I\u2019ve always thought she did it to spite me, rub it in my face. Lefty little brother and all. So proud of being able to do something I could never do. It\u2019s the reason we don\u2019t really get on. What if-- \u201d He can\u2019t continue. He lowers his head.What if it wasn\u2019t on purpose.\nHe can hear Sherlock come to perch on the chair across from him.\nJohn is eight years old, bouncing on the seat of his dad\u2019s old lorry. His dad\u2019s hands, callused, uncomplicated, turning the wheel. \u201cNo school Monday, Johnny? How about you come with me to Devon, eh? There\u2019s an ice cream shop I\u2019ve never tried. Might need someone to try it out for me. Could always use a bit of your good luck on the trip.\u201d\nHamish Watson. A simple, straightforward man, the kind of man who aspired to nothing more than putting a hot meal on the table for his two children, who looked at his son with a quiet sort of pride when he thought John wasn\u2019t looking. The one person from John\u2019s childhood who genuinely never cared what hand John wrote with; who didn\u2019t just pretend not to care, but genuinely didn\u2019t.\u201cMakes no difference,\u201d he would say to John, eyes fixed unerringly on the road. \u201cSo I can find my way on any road in England. If I had a map, I could do it anyway. Just so happens I don\u2019t need one. You don\u2019t need it, John. You don\u2019t need any of it.\u201d\n\u201cMy dad,\u201d John says quietly, eyes fixed on the armchair\u2019s threadbare upholstery. \u201cHe always wanted me to ride with him when he drove, for his job. Said I was good luck. Said he was even better at navigating--\u201d\nJohn finds he can no longer talk. Echoes, a barrage of faces. Ghosts. Sit next to me. C\u2019mon, John, we need you. You\u2019re good company. Always good luck.\n\u201cJohn --\u201d Sherlock is up, pacing again.\u201cShut up, Sherlock, just -- don\u2019t, okay? Just shut up.\u201d This must be what it feels like to lose your mind, John thinks absently. It feels as if his thoughts are rainwater, spilling over gutters, washing out functional synapses with a swell of confusion.\nHis vision floods with snapshots, moving pictures. It\u2019s a lie, he thinks, a fallacy that your life flashes before your eyes at the moment before death. John knows that moment; he\u2019s been there before. He saw only sand, felt only the blank eclipse of pain. But right now, this: this is his life, reeling before his eyes, unwinding into nonsensical ribbons of cause and effect.\nJohn looks up. Sherlock is watching him, head tilted, curious, captivated. As if this is all a very fascinating chemical reaction bubbling out of a test tube in their kitchen. As if John, newly blazing with unknown potential, is about to be the single greatest explosion ever to hit the ceiling of their flat.\n\u201cThere are others,\u201d Sherlock says, as if he can see, as if the reels of memory in John\u2019s mind are playing on a flickering screen in the sitting room. \u201cYou remember other people you may have affected.\u201d\nRaw anger curls John\u2019s hands into fists. \u201cYes, there bloody well are going to be, aren\u2019t there?\u201d he says, words chilled with the snap of sarcasm. \u201cThis is one hell of a way to look at the entire course of my life, all of a sudden, but I suppose you don\u2019t care about that, do you? Not a part of your deduction, was it? \u2018Effect on subject when informed of something that\u2019s influenced his entire life up to this point?\u2019 Did you ever think maybe I\u2019d be better off not knowing? Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m left-handed, Sherlock.\u201d\nSeveral things happen almost at once.\nShivers run up John\u2019s spine; he straightens, shifts uncomfortably.\nLightning-quick, Sherlock grabs an apple from a bowl on the coffee table and throws it straight at John\u2019s head.\n\u201cJesus--\u201d John sputters, too shocked to be furious at this attack. His reflexes are good, always have been. He throws up a hand in defence and catches the apple, which hits his palm with a satisfying smack.\nSherlock\u2019s eyes widen involuntarily. His quick intake of breath is not lost on John in the slightest.\nJohn looks at the apple in his hand. His right hand.\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d John says, entirely derailed by disbelief. He\u2019s forgotten to be angry. He\u2019s beyond it.\nSherlock settles once more onto the back of his chair, fingertips pressed together, half-obscuring his expression.\n\u201cThat was it, wasn\u2019t it,\u201d John says quietly.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cJesus.\u201d John turns the apple over in his hand. It feels... backwards. Unnatural. He swaps it into his left hand, and back again. Neither hand feels right, anymore.\nSilence. Someone is breathing fast; probably John. Maybe both of them.\nJohn walks from the chair slowly to the coffee table and drops the apple back into the bow. He meets Sherlock\u2019s gaze. Sherlock looks a bit elated, as he often does after a deduction. This time the elation is strongly tinged with guilt. The guilt is strange, foreign. Sherlock\u2019s features seem unused to it.\nJohn takes a breath. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says heavily. \u201cOkay. You\u2019ve deduced something.\u201d\nA beat of hesitation before Sherlock speaks. \u201cThe reason you\u2019re left-handed,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re half-right. It might be better if you don\u2019t know about your knack.\u201d\n\u201cHalf-right?\u201d John\u2019s voice cracks. \u201cAre you making a bloody joke?\u201d\nSherlock, to his credit, looks stricken. \u201cNo,\u201d he says quickly. \u201cNo. It\u2019s just that knowledge of your knack may be potentially dangerous to you.\u201d\n\u201cBrilliant. Fantastic. Well, cat\u2019s out of the bag now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cSelf-preservation,\u201d Sherlock murmurs, ignoring John. \u201cFascinating. From a genetic standpoint, it makes perfect sense. An individual with your particular knack could be victimised from a very young age, taken advantage of. But if the individual can make it to adulthood before finding out about it, they may stand a chance of using the knack to their advantage, instead of falling victim to others. Your knack --\u201d His eyes meet John\u2019s. \u201cYour knack deliberately conceals itself, as part of its nature. A safety precaution, as it were.\u201d\n\u201cAssuming this is, in fact, my knack. Assuming you\u2019re right about everything.\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s brow creases. \u201cHow could I not be right about everything?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been wrong. I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d\n\u201cDenial is unbecoming, John.\u201d\n\u201cSo is being an arrogant dick.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not the one being an arrogant dick, at the moment,\u201d Sherlock says coolly.\nThis brings John up short. He shuts his eyes and hears his own voice. Harry, I can\u2019t stay with you. I won\u2019t be your excuse for firing up that knack of yours.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he says. \"You're not.\"\nJohn can hear Sherlock get up, and then he\u2019s close, all warmth and coiled energy. He hovers near John. John doesn\u2019t need to look to know that Sherlock is wavering, uncertain.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d John says, to himself. To both of them.\nA tense breath at his shoulder; then, hesitant, long-fingered hands at his shoulders, on his arms. Gathering him in. His own arms, unwinding, circling Sherlock\u2019s waist. They twine into a fierce, tight knot, anger draining into the mud of fear and disbelief.\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine. It\u2019s all fine,\u201d Sherlock says, hushed, bone-deep. \u201cJohn.\u201d\nThey are there for five minutes, an hour. All day; only a few seconds. John doesn\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t much care.\nJohn\u2019s father, striding resolutely into the primary school office, John in tow. Wearing his driver\u2019s uniform and battered work boots; lifting his chin as he addresses the head of school, a hassled, grey-haired administrator in an ill-fitting suit. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with my lad. But he\u2019s been in a scrap every day this week and you lot just turn the other cheek. My Johnny happens to be mighty good with his left hand and I\u2019d rather not have him learn it\u2019s only for throwing punches.\u201d\u201cWelcome to the Fifth Northumberland, Captain Watson.\u201d John snaps into a habitual salute, right hand held rigid. His superior officer grins disarmingly. \u201cAt ease, Captain. Here in the Fifth we take what\u2019s Left.\u201d\u201cJohn Watson? Yeah, I know him.\u201d An overheard whisper in the staircase, near the lecture hall. \u201cKind of cute, actually. Left-handed, though, did you know?\u201d\u201cCome out with us, John.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice is a slur, giggly, thick-tongued. \u201cYou never want to come out with us. S\u2019much more fun when you\u2019re around, John.\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s voice; Sherlock\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou make me feel... different.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s eyes are shut against the ghosts. Sherlock\u2019s mouth is there, his hands, all scorching heat and distraction, a sweet promise of oblivion. And if John\u2019s cheeks are wet, if his face clouds with memory, if his moans melt into sobs and back again, Sherlock never says. Sherlock engulfs him, fills his ears with deep whispers, and they sleep.\n* * *\nSomewhere, distantly, a phone chirps: Text message. John is in the desert; the hot sun is painted across his back. He hears voices. Must be his unit, just over the crest of the next ridge. His left shoulder screams in agony, and he clutches at it, gasping. He feels blood seep through his splayed fingers, wet and warm. His knees hit the sand. He pulls his hand away -- his left hand -- because it\u2019s his\u00a0right\u00a0shoulder now, his right shoulder that\u2019s flaring with pain, his own blood streaking the sand like red welts. His hand is scarlet, coated in it, almost comically so. He turns it over, palm to the sand, and the sun catches the edge of a deep wound, frightening, circular. Not his shoulder, after all. His left hand, shot clean through. \u201cDon\u2019t mind your hand, John,\u201d Sherlock says, standing above him, coat throwing a curtain of shadow across the sand. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you a new one.\u201d The phone chirps again. Sherlock lies next to him, long and heavy-limbed with sleep. One hand drapes across John\u2019s chest, fingers interlacing with John\u2019s. John rolls toward him as Sherlock\u2019s breathing shifts. \u201cSherlock,\u201d John murmurs. \u201cPhone.\u201d A deep grunt, a flail of limbs, and Sherlock half-sits up, bare to the waist, pink phone in hand. He swipes a thumb across the screen, and two pips chime in the quiet bedroom. Sherlock inhales sharply. \u201cExcellent.\u201d \u201cShit,\u201d John says dully, rubbing his eyes, and his stomach rolls. \u201cShit. It\u2019s him.\u201d Images from yesterday flash through John\u2019s mind, slightly out of focus. A nebulous, unreasonable sense of fear tinges all of it. \u201cView of the Thames. South Bank. Somewhere between Southwark Bridge and Waterloo.\u201d Sherlock swaps the pink phone for his own on the bedside table. \u201cYou check the papers, I\u2019ll look online --\u201d \u201cSherlock.\u201d John sits up. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t do this.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve proven yourself quite capable of reading newspaper headlines in the past.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s eyes flick over his phone\u2019s glowing screen. \u201cJesus, Sherlock, you know that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d John stumbles to standing, pulls on his pants. Sherlock inclines his head toward the doorway. \u201cThe newspaper is in the kitchen.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t go out.\u201d John pulls on his shirt roughly, starts to struggle into his jeans. \u201cWhat if I get too close to someone with a really odd knack? Who knows what I might have accidentally done in the past because I had no bloody idea how I could affect people? I don\u2019t know how to control this, or if I even\u00a0can\u00a0control it.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s focus doesn\u2019t leave the phone. \u201cNothing has changed.\u201d John\u2019s voice cracks on a note he hasn\u2019t hit since primary school. \u201cWhat do you mean, nothing has changed? Everything has changed, Sherlock. My entire life is now completely fucking backwards.\u201d \u201cNothing has changed,\u201d Sherlock repeats, and his eyes finally flick up to John\u2019s. \u201cYou and I are the only people who know about your knack. You didn\u2019t know about it before yesterday, and you managed to make it thirty-eight years without causing any kind of major catastrophe.\u201d John folds his arms over his chest. Someone isn\u2019t making any sense. John suspects Sherlock, but doesn\u2019t feel entirely confident about it. \u201cSo we\u2019re just going to go out.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s attention has shifted back to the phone screen. \u201cI don\u2019t see that we have a choice. The bomber has a new victim.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re getting off on this case,\u201d John says, after a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re\u00a0happy\u00a0about this.\u201d Sherlock looks up. His eyes are eager, intent. \u201cRight now we have an advantage our bomber doesn\u2019t know about. Now we know that if you stay in close proximity I\u2019ll likely be able to solve the case faster. Time, John. We\u2019ll have more time to track him down. Beat the clock.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t care.\u201d John swallows. \u201cYou don\u2019t care about... this. What\u2019s just happened to me.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t\u00a0just\u00a0happen.\u201d John stares up at the ceiling. His breath betrays him, uneven and quick. \u201cOkay. Okay, no, it didn\u2019t\u00a0just\u00a0happen. You\u2019re right.\u201d A long pause. Sherlock has his phone to his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s me. Have you found anything on the South Bank between Waterloo Bridge and Southwark Bridge?\u201d John stalks numbly into the kitchen. His hands find the newspaper, because they usually do what Sherlock says, often without consulting John first. The headlines say nothing. People have died. Archway suicide. Two kids stabbed in Stoke Newington. Someone named Andrew West was found dead on railway lines near Battersea Station. John thinks with some bitterness that he may have a bit more information on that particular scenario than the newspaper is able to provide. He puts on the kettle, goes to the cabinet. Tea, mugs. Two spoons on the counter. His reflection stares back at him from the cupped silver surface of the spoons, warped, inverted. Two John Watsons. The same John Watson; not the same John Watson. The same John Watson knows his fate: he\u2019s going with Sherlock this morning, wherever Sherlock happens to go. He\u2019ll be there, a shadow, a pair of hands. John is certain of nothing now, but he is certain of this. * * * \u201cNeed I remind you,\u201d Sherlock says, flagging down a cab in front of Baker Street, \u201cthat nine out of ten individuals have knacks that are almost entirely insignificant? And one out of ten are left-handed? Do the math, John.\u201d The rational part of John\u2019s brain can, in fact, do the math. The rest of it, a far bigger percentage than John realised, is devolving into a subtle state of paranoia. It\u2019s the paranoid part that\u2019s rearing its frantic, terrified head at the moment, the paranoid part that\u2019s urging John to lock himself in the relative safety of 221b for however long it takes to wrap his mind around his new --\u00a0old?\u00a0-- ability. Ten minutes ago, Lestrade called Sherlock with news of a man found dead on the South Bank. Since that time, Sherlock has blithely ignored John\u2019s harried \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios in favour of the argument that John by his side is worth the risk of whatever unpredictable effect John\u2019s knack could have on their investigation. \u201cMost people go to school for this, Sherlock.\u201d John slides into the cab behind him and slams the door. \u201cFor years. And I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but I happen to be lacking any training whatsoever.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re overreacting.\u201d Sherlock pulls out his phone, swipes at the screen. His near-indecent glee at the rekindled case sharpens quickly into annoyance. \u201cThe chance that you\u2019ll encounter someone whose knack interacts dangerously with your own while investigating this corpse is slim bordering on zero. John, we do this every day.\u201d John slumps into his seat, stares out the window at the fiercely cold winter sun, which has slipped behind a cloud. Sherlock pockets his phone and his voice drops, low enough to be for John\u2019s ears alone. \u201cAnderson. Trivia, memory-based; falls under the mental classification. Anderson erratically retains random trivial facts; the only possible effect you could have on Anderson would be to make him even more annoying than he already is.\u201d A pause. \u201cIn fact, you may have done it before.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see what this has to do with --\u201d \u201cI know the knacks of over half the Yard, John.\u201d John chuckles darkly. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be reassuring, is it?\u201d \u201cYou want specifics?\u201d Sherlock says, and his eyes brighten almost in spite of his mood. John knows this expression -- Sherlock can\u2019t resist showing off, even if his temper is starting to flare. \u201cGo on, then. Anyone we might encounter.\u201d They exchange a weighted look. John sighs. \u201cFine. Donovan.\u201d \u201cPhysical, olfactory. She can detect the presence of human blood under most circumstances, even if it\u2019s several days old. No significant danger in enhancing that.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cIt is, I\u2019ll admit, useful on occasion.\u201d Sherlock says begrudgingly. \u201cOkay,\u201d John says, curiosity starting to edge out paranoia. \u201cLestrade. What have I done to Lestrade? You must know his knack.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d Sherlock says, a puzzled crease between his brows. \u201cHis is fairly common knowledge.\u201d \u201cSherlock, we\u2019ve been over this. The definition of \u2018common knowledge\u2019 is not \u2018anything that can be deduced by one man with unusually exceptional skills of observation.\u2019\u201d Sherlock rolls his eyes. \u201cI doubt your ability has had much effect on Lestrade during our investigations. Lestrade\u2019s is mental, linguistic. Canine communication.\u201d \u201cLestrade can\u00a0talk to dogs?\u201d \u201cSurely you knew that.\u201d This news is utterly distracting. John is incredulous. \u201cYou mean -- all this time, when you were referring to Lestrade\u2019s dogs, his, his \u2018sniffer dogs\u2019 -- you weren\u2019t joking?\u201d Sherlock stares. \u201cNot in the least.\u201d John gapes back at him. \u201cWhy,\u201d he says after a moment, \u201cwhy, then, doesn\u2019t he work with, I don\u2019t know --\u00a0actual police dogs?\u00a0What is he doing in homicide?\u201d \u201cI think he started out in the Dog Support Unit, but apparently got fed up with it. Found his canine partner rather annoying. Prefers to work with humans. They still ask him to come into DSU from time to time to assist with the occasional emergency.\u201d John shakes his head.\u201cYou just assumed I knew this.\u201d \u201cMolly Hooper,\u201d Sherlock continues, barrelling onward. \u201cHave you noticed anything unusual about Molly at all?\u201d \u201cMolly. At the lab? No,\u201d John says automatically. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s nothing, really. Probably nothing.\u201d \u201cTry to remember.\u201d \u201cLast time I was at the lab,\u201d John says, and the memory is hazy; he mostly remembers Sherlock that day. Sherlock\u2019s breath on his neck, a kiss against wet bricks. He feels queasy at the rush of thought. \u201cShe came up behind me in the hall. I could have sworn she didn\u2019t make any noise at all. Surprised me. I can\u2019t see what that has to do with anything.\u201d \u201cYou heard nothing, you said.\u201d \u201cNot even a footstep,\u201d John says. \u201cIs that her knack, then?\u201d \u201cNot exactly.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s eyes are keen, analysing John\u2019s face. \u201cMolly\u2019s knack is rare, complicated. If her knack was enhanced, it\u2019s entirely possible you wouldn\u2019t see or hear her approach at all.\u201d \u201cNot invisibility. That\u2019s not possible.\u201d \u201cInvisibility is a fairy tale. No, Molly Hooper goes\u00a0unnoticed.\u00a0Not unseen -- just unnoticed. It's a difficult knack to control, as I understand it. It remains active almost all the time. Takes some effort on her part to overcome it.\" \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t overcome it -- no one notices her?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cChrist,\u201d John mutters.\u201cThat must be awful.\u201d \"Awful, but sometimes quite powerful. It's a good job Molly didn't decide to pursue a career in something more... criminal. I solved a case, once, in which the perpetrator had the same knack. One of the most skilled thieves in London. Thankfully, Molly prefers the company of corpses.\" \"Because it doesn't matter if they don't notice her,\" John says. His hands have gone cold and clammy, clenched into fists. Molly. Maybe she\u2019s always wished to be left-handed. Wondered if it would be better that way.It would be better, Molly,\u00a0John thinks.\u00a0It is better. \"I hadn't thought of that,\" Sherlock says quietly. \u201cI sure as hell hope that\u2019s the only part of this you haven\u2019t thought about.\u201d John can feel bitterness rising in his throat like bile. Sherlock looks at him, arches an eyebrow sharply. \u201cIt goes without saying that you\u2019ll tell me if we -- if I need to leave,\u201d John says slowly, deliberately. \u201cIf, say, we\u2019re out somewhere, and someone has a knack I shouldn\u2019t be around.\u201d \u201cOur cab driver is left-handed.\u201d Sherlock says. He tilts his head in the direction of the front seat. John swallows. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYou seem to need proof that I notice these things.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s voice, still low, takes on a hard, mocking edge. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re suffering from some kind of selective amnesia regarding my abilities.\u201d Left-handed. John looks through the scratched glass at the silhouette of the cab driver. A man about John\u2019s age, by the looks of it. Ginger-haired, greying at the temples. Green golf cap. Left-handed.Left hand is slightly bigger than his right hand,\u00a0he hears Sherlock say in his head.\u00a0Callus from holding a pen on the inside of his left middle finger, not his right. Spots of ink on his cap behind his left ear, where he\u2019d probably kept a pen; only a Lefty would keep it on that side. John would have noticed. John does notice these things, ordinarily. He makes a point of noticing. John would have tipped the cabbie. Even if Sherlock paid, John would have tipped him extra. And then he would have caught his eye, and nodded. And the cabbie would have known about John. The nod, the smile.\u00a0Nice day, mate. Right. John feels something cold in the pit of his stomach, something cold and strange. The winks, the smiles: the warm antidote to stares and whispers. Not his anymore. Not his to give. He\u2019s not one of them anymore, not really. He doesn\u2019t want this. Never in his life has he wanted anything less. It feels like a punishment, a cruel twist wrenched into his life because he\u2019d had the gall to wish, on certain bad days, that he he wasn\u2019t left-handed. A slap on the hand doled out because his thoughts had strayed to envy. John finds he can\u2019t reply. Sherlock says nothing. The cab skids to a halt and they brace themselves against the icy morning air. It\u2019s biting, bone-chilling cold, and the pavement is slick and damp. The breeze whips the smoke of their breath away as soon as it appears. Sherlock sets off down the street in hurried, impossibly long strides, and John has to move twice as fast to keep up. John\u2019s panic redoubles, uncertainty slamming into him. It feels as if he\u2019s clinging to fading threads of order, threads that are unravelling into chaos, slipping through his hands. An entire part of himself he can\u2019t control, something that\u2019s been shifting the scenery of his life without his knowledge. Invisible hands twitching puppet strings behind a curtain. \u201cSherlock. It\u2019s still not safe, my being here. What about the murderer?\u201d John\u2019s breath comes in uneven hitches; his words are stolen by the cold. \u201cWhat about the bloody bomber, for God\u2019s sake? We don\u2019t know his knack. What if -- what if I\u2019m somehow enabling him? Influencing what he can do? We don\u2019t know how close I need to be, to affect someone. What if he\u2019s nearby, what if --\u201d Panic is gripping him, closing the space around his heartbeat, pinning his thoughts into a narrow band of fear. He grabs Sherlock roughly by the shoulder. \u201cStop,\u00a0damn it,\u00a0Sherlock!\u201d Sherlock whirls to look at him, eyes cold. Furious. \u201cYou think I haven\u2019t thought of that? It\u2019s a risk, John. There have always been risks. You know that.\u201d John steps back and flexes his hands. His heart is still pounding, a dull racket roaring in his ears. \u201cYou can go.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s words cut the air with ice. \u201cThere\u2019s no gun to your back.\u201d John takes a breath, looks away. They\u2019re utterly alone, near the edge of the embankment. A metal staircase leads down to the shoreline, and John can see Lestrade\u2019s team at work around a bloated form washed up far from the tide\u2019s receding edge. John could go. He could walk back up this street, find a cab, find a restaurant. A crappy Chinese restaurant with the dishes advertised in glossy photos above the counter. Order a plate of something hot and liberally spiked with MSG. He could read the paper, or maybe a novel. No corpses. No ticking clock. Sherlock would be okay. Sherlock survived without him. He could do it again. There would be no one opposite John in the Chinese restaurant, fingers drumming on the table, waiting for John to finish because of course there\u2019s only one plate between the two of them. No one with blazing eyes explaining why the wife stopped at Tesco and picked up a packet of cigarettes which the murderer lifted from the crime scene so he could smoke on the walk home. No one pressing a gun into John\u2019s steady, sweat-damp hands, no one looking at John with that exhilarated, wild look, the look that shuts out the world while they run for it. The look that\u2019s only for John. John reaches under his coat, feels the handle of his gun, metal warmed with body heat. He glances around to ensure they\u2019re still alone, then pulls it out, hefts the weight of it. \u201cThere\u2019s always a gun,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cThere has to be.\u201dI said dangerous,\u00a0Sherlock\u2019s voice says, an echo in John\u2019s head, a sound like the wake of a bullet.\u00a0And here you are. Sherlock looks at him. Looks through him. Waits. John slips the gun back under his coat, against his back. He feels his jaw clench. The metal is cold, even with the briefest exposure to air. He looks up at Sherlock. They don\u2019t need to say anything. There\u2019s a body waiting on the riverbank. * * * The body on the bank of the Thames is inflated, puffed high with the bloat of river water and decay. Even if it hadn\u2019t been days in the river, the dead man would still be large and unwieldy, a grey, wobbly mass in an ill-fitting uniform. John\u2019s shoes aren\u2019t made for squatting in the ebbing tide; his socks are damp now, and he\u2019s starting to shiver as he studies the clammy corpse. It\u2019s the wrong sort of shivering. He\u2019s got a knack. This idea is settling, seeping into him like the water of the Thames is bleeding into the seams of his shoes. Time wears away the sharp edges of shock. A knack of his own, he can accept. A knack without control, however, is far more difficult to swallow. Sherlock mentioned physical signs, signs that John\u2019s knack might be activating. The sensations, in retrospect, are clear -- John\u2019s neck, crawling. His shoulder, twinging. Shivers. An itch at the back of his throat. Vague, nagging discomfort comes in a thousand shades, and any one of them could be a sign that he\u2019s about to magnify someone else\u2019s ability. But now that John is aware of his knack\u2019s existence, can he impose control by sheer force of will? He doesn\u2019t even know his knack\u2019s categorisation -- the most fundamental piece of information, a grade-school basic. Can this knack be directed, laser-like, or is it like a broad flood of light, a chaotic ricochet of sheer luck? It\u2019s quite possible that his knack never goes dormant, but remains active constantly, with peaks and valleys of activity; this is something those years of missed education would have revealed. John turns over the dead man\u2019s left hand in his own and tries to train his thoughts back to the corpse, reason out a likely time of death. He mostly fails, realising after a few minutes that he\u2019s merely staring into space and waiting for any sign of his knack making itself known. \u201cJohn. Anything?\u201d Sherlock\u2019s deep voice above him: a dual meaning, one of them known only to John. \u201cNot really,\u201d John says, and Sherlock will know what this really means.\u00a0Nothing, Sherlock. Nothing\u2019s happening to me. \u201cHe\u2019s been in the river a long while. The water\u2019s destroyed most of the data.\u201d \u201cDead about... 24 hours,\u201d John finally guesses, feeling it would be increasingly awkward not to say anything. He can sense Lestrade behind him and straightens. \u201cDid he drown?\u201d \u201cAsphyxiated,\u201d Lestrade says. John glances at him.\u00a0Dogs,\u00a0he thinks, and feels a bit as if the world has gone insane. \u201cMakes sense,\u201d he says, hoping his expression doesn\u2019t betray the tenuous hold he has on the situation. The corpse. Think about the corpse. He squats down again between the cold, tumbled stones on the bank, peers at the man\u2019s hairline, his neck. Anything. Is he feeling anything? Bruises, he could talk about bruises. The man is what, late thirties? John shifts, coughs a bit. Was that his knack? No, he coughed on purpose. He might be talking out loud, rambling about the body. Is he talking? His muscles are nearly vibrating with watchful effort. He feels as if he\u2019s listening along every nerve. Sherlock squats next to him, fingers skimming the fabric of the dead man\u2019s shirt, and pulls out his magnifying glass. He\u2019s scanning, focused, but his shoulder is a hand\u2019s length away, purposefully close. Reassuring. He can tell John needs it. By the time Sherlock straightens up, John is breathing a bit more easily. He gives the corpse another cursory glance before standing. He watches Sherlock tap buttons on his mobile, watches Sherlock\u2019s eyes skim the ground, glance over the man\u2019s feet -- when were his shoes removed? John must have missed that. He watches the familiar deep crease of concentration appear between Sherlock\u2019s brows. That\u2019s when the crackle of raw nerves fires between John\u2019s shoulder blades without warning, without any preface at all, and he cricks his neck to the side and stares wide-eyed at Sherlock, who is looking back at him with eyes equally wide. A swift smile sweeps across Sherlock\u2019s face and he turns away, punching keys urgently on his mobile. John knows. The set of Sherlock's shoulders, the keen, faraway look as his eyes scan some unseen point in midair. John's pulse is elevated. The tips of his fingers are tingling, barely. Just barely. He tests each breath as it shudders out of his lungs. That was it. He can feel it. The sensation is subtle enough that it could mask itself as any number of things, and it's already dissipating, gone so fast John is almost deprived of a sense that it was real. A phantom spark, near-imaginary, like a dream that slips out of reach just as it's remembered. \"Fingertips,\" Sherlock says, and for a moment John is frozen, wondering if his knack has suddenly granted Sherlock the power to read minds.\u00a0Fingertips.\u00a0For a moment, he felt it in his fingertips. But Sherlock glances at his phone again, the corner of his mouth quirked in wicked victory, and it\u2019s clearly just an odd coincidence. \"What?\" Lestrade steps nearer to Sherlock, watching. He knows that look, too. \"I'll tell you one thing,\" Sherlock says, with a near-indecent grin. \"That lost Vermeer painting's a fake.\" The deduction unravels, then, a Rube Goldberg machine of slick connections, a thrilling feat of logic that leaps, acrobat-like, to a singular conclusion. Sherlock himself is glowing with proud disbelief. His hands gesture like wings as he describes the likely killer, his eyes locked on John alone, and he grins.\n* * *\n\u201cNo,\u201d John says, arms folded like a wall. Waterloo Bridge arcs above them. The cab next to them is idling, the cabbie starting to look peeved. \u201cNope. No way. You\u2019re not leaving right now. You\u2019re coming with me, or I\u2019m going back to Baker Street.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s deduction has led them here in search of an assassin known as the Golem, whose calling card is the distinctive pattern of marks left on a victim\u2019s throat. Fingertips; large fingertips. Woodbridge had stumbled unawares into the Golem\u2019s freakishly strong grip. A knack, most likely, and a particularly deadly one. The bomber hasn\u2019t phoned. The pink phone\u2019s silence taunts, a deliberate absence of sound designed to set them on edge. In John\u2019s case, it\u2019s working rather well. Sherlock has just paid off a local Waterloo Bridge resident in exchange for information. What information, Sherlock won\u2019t say. This is not atypical. The fact that Sherlock was about to dash off without explanation a moment ago, also not atypical. John can tell easily enough when Sherlock is about to disappear for the day. Today, however, will not be one of those days, not if John has anything to do with it. Sherlock glares petulantly. \u201cYou\u2019re in no danger conducting an interview alone.\u201d \u201cGoing to guarantee that, are you?\u201d \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, John, you could die in any number of freakish ways this afternoon,\u201d Sherlock growls. \u201cI\u2019m flattered you think my presence would prevent all of them.\u201d \u201cYou dragged me out of the flat to a crime scene because you needed my bloody knack,\u201d John says archly, \u201cand that\u2019s it, then? Got what you came for? I\u2019m dismissed?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re wasting time. It\u2019s far more efficient if I go to the gallery now, and you go to the flat. Your knack works best after I\u2019ve had a chance to gather all the relevant data.\u201d Sherlock looks skyward, shakes his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t see.\u201d \u201cOh, always. \u2018I don\u2019t see.\u2019 There\u2019s always something I don\u2019t see, Sherlock.\u201d Sherlock steps closer, his eyes bright. \u201cYou have to trust me. You said it yourself: that deduction was amazing. Extraordinary. And that wasn\u2019t just me. I did it because you were there, John. That speed, those leaps of logic -- everything is so much clearer, every detail has meaning, I can feel it happening. Can\u2019t you see what we can do?\u201d John swallows. We. What we can do. Sherlock tilts his head, eyes roving over the clear tension in the set of John\u2019s jaw. \u201cWhen this case is over,\u201d he says, his baritone dropping into quiet intimacy, \u201cwe\u2019ll figure out your knack. It won\u2019t take much, if we work together. You\u2019ll get control of it, John. We don\u2019t have time, now. But we will.\u201d \u201cYou --\u201d John finds his voice. It sounds lost. \u201cYou think so.\u201d Sherlock arches an eyebrow. It says, quite clearly, I am never wrong. John feels something within him give way, just a bit. And then it hits him: He\u2019s tired. Endlessly tired. It feels as if he\u2019s lived three full lifetimes since yesterday -- has it only been a day since Joe Harrison\u2019s flat, since Sherlock\u2019s little life-shattering discovery? He doesn\u2019t feel like holding on so tightly, anymore. He doesn\u2019t know if he can. Sherlock is right. If they figure it out, if John can control it, can grip the heart of this rogue ability with the ease of curling a finger around a trigger -- If John can set someone in his sights, aim with the cool knowledge that he\u2019ll never miss -- \u201cOkay,\u201d John says. It feels more like a promise than a surrender. He rubs his hands together in the cold, takes a breath. \u201cOkay.\u201d The slow tease of a smile curls the corner of Sherlock\u2019s mouth, and his eyes say something John honestly can\u2019t absorb. Overwhelming. Hopeful. Sherlock -- Sherlock, of all people -- has been crushingly patient. He\u2019s been waiting for John to see this, to see the potential of what they have. Sherlock has taken all of it, has absorbed John\u2019s rage and fear, has watched and reasoned and cajoled as John crashed around him with the force of a storm. Sherlock, who up until now has been the storm himself. \u201cGod, I love you,\u201d John says. It\u2019s out, the truth ringing between them before he can think about it. It\u2019s not something he\u2019s said before, to anyone. It should have been harder to say. At the look on Sherlock\u2019s face, John feels an utter fool for not saying it sooner. \u201cJohn --\u201d Sherlock breathes, but John covers the word with a reckless, deep kiss. It doesn\u2019t matter what Sherlock was going to say, not in the least. Clarity shudders through John like a gasping breath. This is the only thing that matters: Sherlock\u2019s surprised, quiet moan, his coat lapels in John\u2019s fisted hands. Behind them, the cabbie honks. Sherlock\u2019s hands disappear from John\u2019s shoulders, leaving vacant prints of heat. He twists in the cab\u2019s direction and bellows something that sounds shockingly rude in the refined tones of his accent. The cabbie honks again in return. John\u2019s phone chooses this moment to chirp twice in his jacket pocket. John drops his head to Sherlock\u2019s chest and stifles a laugh. The laugh won\u2019t be stifled, however, and it expands to infect both of them. Sherlock\u2019s large hands wrap around John\u2019s lower back, gun and all, and pull him close. He presses a fleeting kiss to the top of John\u2019s head before releasing him. John sighs, heart pounding, and pulls his phone from his pocket.Kindly tell my brother I\u2019m still waiting for the Andrew West memory stick. MH You can also tell him I find public displays of affection refreshingly progressive. MH John rolls his eyes, glances around. He flips a two-finger salute in all four cardinal directions, just for good measure. \u201cMycroft?\u201d \u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d A deep chuckle. \u201cI never guess.\u201d \u201cYou never gave him the memory stick?\u201d Sherlock gives John a pointed look, eyebrow quirked. \u201cBeen a bit busy.\u201d \u201cTrue.\u201d Sherlock glances around and raises his voice. \u201cPiss off, Mycroft.\u201d John grins. Time seems to slam back into them, then. A car roars by on the busy roadway and Sherlock steps toward the cab, inclines his head. \u201cCome on. Woodbridge\u2019s flat isn\u2019t far.\u201d John\u2019s eyebrows creep up in surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re coming?\u201d \u201cOf course. You\u2019re right.\u201d Sherlock unfolds his wallet and pulls out a few notes, steps up to the window of the cab and hands them inside. A peace offering. \u201cI should go with you.\u201d \u201cWhat about the gallery?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll head there afterwards. With both of us at the flat it won\u2019t take long.\u201d Sherlock holds open the door of the cab, framing the entrance with a long arm. \u201cJohn.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d John takes a breath, steps up to the cab. \u201cThanks.\u201d They fold themselves into the back seat, settling in out of habit, a comfort born of so many days spent leaning against cab windows. Sherlock glances at John, a warm shadow of a smile, and the cab accelerates into the dark. * * * \u201cCould you just --\u201d John hisses under his breath, as Alex Woodbridge\u2019s housemate stares. \u201cCould you just, you know, tone it down? A bit?\u201d \u201cIs he all right?\u201d Alex Woodbridge\u2019s rather ordinary housemate -- Julia? no, Julie -- is staring at Sherlock as if he has just stepped off a spaceship from an alien planet. John doesn\u2019t blame her. Sherlock is in rare form, peering at every available surface, dropping to his knees to inspect Woodbridge\u2019s shoes, rifling through dirty laundry. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d Sherlock says breezily, his head now halfway under Woodbridge\u2019s lumpy single bed. \u201cHe does that,\u201d John adds. Sherlock slithers a bit farther under the bed. \u201cHe, er, may not want to do that,\u201d Julie says, with something of a quiet cringe. \u201cAlex was never much of one for hoovering.\u201d John gestures at the telescope on one side of the small attic bedroom, which Sherlock\u2019s tornado-like inspection has uncovered. \u201cWas Alex a stargazer, then?\u201d \u201cGod, yeah. Mad about it,\u201d Julie says, still staring at Sherlock, who has emerged from under the bed brushing quantities of dust from his coat, and is now peering at the radio on the bedside table. \u201cAnd did he know much about art?\u201d \u201cNo, not really.\u201d Julie shifts her weight uncomfortably. It seems she\u2019s quite eager to rid herself of the madman prowling through her ex-housemate\u2019s belongings. \u201cThere was a message left for Alex on the landline. I can get the phone, play it for you if you like.\u201d \u201cThanks. Yeah, that would be great.\u201d Julie vanishes down the hallway. John watches Sherlock\u2019s long-fingered hands turn over the message pad next to the phone. He opens his mouth to speak, but his throat suddenly feels strange -- there\u2019s a tickle at the back. Must be dust, must be all the dust Sherlock\u2019s kicked up from under the bed -- John coughs, twice. One of his fingers tingles a bit, on his right hand, just for a moment. That\u2019s it, he thinks. Again. \u201cSherlock --\u201d he breathes, but Sherlock has already whirled to look at him, eyebrows raised, a familiar expression on his face. \u201cJohn, you --\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d says John, and he can\u2019t help grinning. \u201cYeah. I felt it.\u201d \u201cExcellent.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s answering grin is broad, triumphant. \u201cYou -- oh.\u201d \u201cWhat? Did you get anything?\u201d \u201cWoodbridge was left-handed,\u201d Sherlock says authoritatively, surveying the room. John\u2019s brow furrows. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d Sherlock fixes him with a boyish, self-satisfied look and gestures at the telescope. \u201cFor a start, the telescope is positioned at a particular angle, with scuff marks on the floor indicating that Woodbridge looked into the viewfinder with his left eye, not his right -- far more common in left-handed individuals. Computer mouse on the left hand side of the keyboard, quite obvious. Pen and paper on the left hand side of the phone. He picked up the phone with his right hand, took messages with his left. Most power sockets in here, used on the left.\u201d \u201cHis watch was on his left wrist,\u201d John murmurs, \u201cbut that\u2019s hardly uncommon.\u201d He holds up his own wrist. \u201cExactly.\u201d Heavy footsteps in the stairwell. \u201cLovely detail,\u201d John says quietly, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see what this has to do with anything.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s grin spreads into something broad and wolfish. \u201cA pattern,\u201d he says. \u201cOne victim, inconsequential. Two, still might be coincidental. Three, time to start paying attention.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t follow --\u201d \u201cCarl Powers. Left-handed,\u201d Sherlock says hurriedly. \u201cIan Monkford, also a Lefty, according to the rental papers from Janus Cars. And now, Alex Woodbridge -- left-handed.\u201d \u201cYou talking about Alex?\u201d Julie peers into the bedroom. \u201cYeah, he was left-handed. Bit down about it sometimes, poor sod. Thought he might have had a better job, otherwise.\u201d John feels his jaw clench reflexively. \u201cThat\u2019s, er. Did you have that message?\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d she says, stepping back into the room to hand John the phone, but Sherlock crowds past them, pushing his way to the stairwell, vanishing in a cloud of dust and wool. \u201cMeet you downstairs,\u201d he mutters at John. \u201cSorry,\u201d John says, and he can\u2019t help a faint smile. \u201cSorry, he --\u201d \u201cDoes that,\u201d Julie supplies. \u201cYeah, I figured.\u201d * * * Their feet echo against the slick pavement, torches throwing arcs of light against the wet, dripping bricks. A short while ago, a member of Sherlock\u2019s homeless network pressed a dirty scrap of paper into Sherlock\u2019s hand just as they were about to take a cab to the gallery. The gallery visit was postponed without much explanation, but John doesn\u2019t need one. This dripping, dank network of railway tunnels can only be the chosen hideout of a particular assassin. Shadows sweep before them, wavering against the brick. Piles of rubbish stir ominously. A huge, distorted silhouette looms against a distant wall. John grabs Sherlock\u2019s arm and wrestles them both against cold, uneven stone, out of sight. It smells of piss. They switch off their torches. They\u2019re both breathing hard, sides pressed against each other, a long line of warmth in the damp tunnel. John\u2019s hand closes, palm full of the comfort of metal, and he realizes he must have swapped his torch for his gun without thinking. He shuts his eyes and he\u2019s at the Jabez office, Sherlock warm against his side, just like this: hearts pounding, the sweet buzz of adrenaline. In the next moment, he\u2019s walking in the park, leaning heavily on his cane and thinking of the gun in his bedsit. Another man in another lifetime. He shivers. Footsteps. Sherlock flinches next to him and they both move as one, lunging back into the tunnel, tearing off after the receding shadow. The lanky, gargantuan form of the Golem disappears into a waiting BMW. Tires screech as it pulls away. Sherlock whirls, curses, his deep voice rebounding in the empty tunnel. John looks down at his gun, at the ready. His gun, in his right hand. \u201cMy gun,\u201d he says. \u201cThink --\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d Sherlock says, and grabs John\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThe phone message.\u201d \u201cProfessor Cairns. You don\u2019t think that\u2019s where --\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t be too many in the phone book. Come on, John.\u201d * * * They burst through the door of the planetarium to a noise that sounds far too much like someone\u2019s last breath. A film plays on a curved screen in the dark room, stars and planets spinning while a refined, all-knowing voice describes the universe. Sherlock bellows as the Golem\u2019s shadow lurches against the wall, a funhouse distortion of human form. They hear a dull, sudden thud that can only be the sound of a body hitting the ground. The movie warps, plunging the room into alternating flashes of dark and light. Professor Cairns. Shit. John darts up the stairs toward the spot where the Golem\u2019s shadow wavered, but after another round of bright flashes, his vision is ruined. Afterimages of the room sear his retinas like some horrific stop-motion film. He makes it to the upper tier of the room before Sherlock gives a muffled shout from below. Panicked, John stumbles back down the steps, gun drawn, cursing himself for bolting off. The light flickers to reveal Sherlock and the Golem tangled in front of the planetarium screen, washed in stars. John raises his gun steadily as spots flash in front of his eyes. Two hands on the gun. If only he could see -- He can\u2019t get a clean shot. Sherlock struggles, head bent against the Golem\u2019s enormous chest as the Golem curls around him. \u201cLet him go,\u201d John grits out, still seeking his target, despairing at the wrestling mass in front of him. \u201cLet him go, or I will kill you.\u201d The Golem\u2019s huge, bald head snaps up to peer at John, and Sherlock seizes the chance and sinks his teeth into the Golem\u2019s arm. The assassin howls. Still no shot. Sherlock twists, and John hears another grunt, a kick. The film skips again, the narrator\u2019s voice warbling in unsteady chirps, but John barely notices over the noise of his thudding heart. \u201cSherlock --\u201d The light flickers and Sherlock\u2019s face flashes into view, strained and furious. He clutches the Golem\u2019s hands, trying to pull -- Fingertips, John thinks, Christ. The Golem\u2019s fingertips. Anything to keep those hands away from Sherlock, to get Sherlock out of that grip -- John circles, but the Golem moves with him, wheeling Sherlock between them like a wiry, struggling doll. Just then the Golem stumbles as Sherlock\u2019s foot flies out to one side. They teeter wildly out of balance, and the Golem\u2019s grip seems to fumble. Sherlock twists again, a flash of movement -- John\u2019s left shoulder twinges, sharp pain shooting from deltoid to fingertips, electric and numb. He gasps, winces. The Golem gives an astonished grunt. The enormous assassin suddenly regains his footing and makes another grab at Sherlock. Sherlock\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cJohn --\u201d he manages, a low gasp, but before he can say more, a single massive hand closes around Sherlock\u2019s neck. The Golem wrests him to the ground in the space of a breath. John\u2019s entire body goes cold. The film flickers and dies, plunging them into near-total darkness. John listens for breath. He hears almost nothing. Against the darkness, a last mental image: the Golem hunching above Sherlock\u2019s prone form. He takes the shot. Noise and light from the gun. A deep cry of pain. Scuffling in the dark, limbs against ground. Ragged breath. \u201cSherlock!\u201d John gropes wildly on the ground with his free hand. Still blinded by flashes, he can\u2019t see much else but the dim light from the sole emergency exit. More scuffling. His ears ring with the noise of his gun. The scuffling seems to recede. His hands find the familiar rough weave of wool. Sherlock\u2019s sleeve, his arm, unmoving. John\u2019s hands fly over Sherlock\u2019s prone form, seek out his thick curls, the fine bones of his face. His lips are soft and slack. His narrow chest is still. John fumbles for Sherlock\u2019s wrist, and there: a faint, scattershot pulse. Reflexes kick in. John tips Sherlock\u2019s head back, puts one ear to his mouth. It\u2019s too dark to properly watch Sherlock\u2019s chest, so he rests a hand on it instead. John had always said he could do this blindfolded. Never thought he\u2019d have to make good on his word. \u201cSherlock?\u201d John feels the barest movement of air against his cheek. Sherlock is breathing. Breathing, but not conscious. Shit. He leans in even closer to Sherlock\u2019s ear, taps him hard, once, on the shoulder. \u201cCome on, Sherlock.\u201d Sherlock gasps. \"It\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay,\u201d John urges. One hand on Sherlock\u2019s shoulder, one on his side; John rolls him into recovery position. Sherlock inhales raggedly, coughs hard, and vomits onto the slick linoleum floor. John breathes. \u201cDid he --\u201d Sherlock chokes, his voice rough and weak. \u201cDid he get away?\u201d \u201cYou bloody idiot,\u201d John says, and his own voice sounds rough, almost rougher than Sherlock\u2019s. In the dark he moves to Sherlock\u2019s other side, grasps his shoulders, positions him away from any mess left on the floor. There\u2019s another nearby spot that feels sticky. Blood, perhaps. John sends up a vindictive prayer that it belongs to the Golem. Sherlock coughs again. His voice is a wheeze. \u201cDid you see him?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d John says, still gripping Sherlock\u2019s shoulder. His other hand reflexively seeks Sherlock\u2019s hair, his face, his neck, the pulse at his jugular vein. It\u2019s fast, but regular. All seems in order, at least as much as John can tell in the dark. \u201cI was busy.\u201d \u201cJohn --\u201d \u201cShut up, Sherlock,\u201d John says, a bitter, broken sound. \u201cShut up.\u201d It\u2019s hitting him now, the sequence of events. The likely cause of the Golem\u2019s sudden advantage. All data points to one obvious conclusion. He feels Sherlock\u2019s hand slip over his: the left one. The one measuring the rise and fall of Sherlock\u2019s chest. Sherlock\u2019s hand traps it there, and they breathe in the dark. \u201cThe gallery,\u201d Sherlock says, after a moment. He struggles to sit up. \u201cWe have to go.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t -- You\u2019re going to hospital, Sherlock.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s sitting now, propped heavily against John. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He leans in unexpectedly, wraps a hand around the back of John\u2019s neck, and presses their foreheads together. John can feel Sherlock\u2019s breath on his cheek. And then Sherlock struggles to his feet, a hand braced on John\u2019s shoulder. He sways, and then his torch casts a blinding beam across the walls, into the corners of the room. \u201cLooks like you hit him,\u201d Sherlock says, sweeping his torch in a wide arc. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like enough blood to be a fatal wound.\u201d \u201cGot away, then.\u201d \u201cYes. Must have. Let\u2019s check the upper level just to be sure.\u201d A simple order. Business as usual. You were almost dead, Sherlock. All in a day\u2019s work, is it? \u201cRight,\u201d John says, and it\u2019s a cold salute. A captain to his commanding officer. Sherlock casts his torch into the darkness, searching. His footfalls echo, unsteady and tentative, on the slick floor, and John follows. * * * The solitary painting mocks them from the far wall. Two people are dead. Nearly a third, John thinks. So very nearly a third. They are no closer to a solution, and somewhere, presumably, another victim is covered in explosives. The bomber is winning. Has already won, perhaps. They didn\u2019t speak on the cab ride to the gallery. Sherlock is next to him now, coat removed, strength largely recovered, studying the not-Vermeer in question. His bespoke suit is barely wrinkled, neat white button-down open at the collar. Quite professional, quite polished, apart from the five large, distinctly fingertip-shaped bruises darkening from red to purple across his neck like some sort of deranged tattoo. John\u2019s relief is swiftly hardening into sickening fury. \u201cJohn,\u201d Sherlock says, under his breath. Entire thoughts, unspoken, in that word. \u201cGo on, then. You\u2019re the genius,\u201d John mutters. It comes out a bit harsher than expected. Lestrade, behind Sherlock, gives John a startled sidelong glance. John doesn\u2019t return it. He\u2019s not quite sure what he would say, if he allowed himself to speak. Sherlock fishes out the pink phone, typing on it as if to summon the solution via sheer force of will. \u201cThe painting is a fake,\u201d he mutters. \u201cIt has to be.\u201d The gallery owner, severe, well-dressed, paces with distinct discomfort. \u201cThat painting has been put to every test --\u201d The abrupt ring of the phone in Sherlock\u2019s hand interrupts her. Sherlock answers it with a single swipe of his thumb. \u201cThe painting is a fake. That\u2019s the answer.\u201d Silence. \u201cI\u2019ve got the solution, the painting has to be a fake. Prove it? You want me to prove it?\u201d No response. Sherlock stares at the painting, the phone held out in front of him. \u201cI\u2019ll prove it. Time. Just give me time.\u201d \u201cTen.\u201d A voice issues from the phone: A child. Clearly, a child. John feels sick. He swallows against nauseating fear. Lestrade, next to him, groans and turns away, visibly pained. \u201cIt\u2019s a kid. Jesus, it\u2019s a kid.\u201d \u201cNine.\u201d Sherlock whirls, stares at John. Pleading.I can\u2019t, John thinks at him, I can\u2019t control it, you know it, Sherlock -- He can\u2019t control it. Because he can\u2019t, Sherlock nearly died. Because he can\u2019t, this kid is about to die. It\u2019s like some kind of twisted test doled out by the universe: Ready, John Watson? Your ability would be damn useful if only you knew how to use it. John turns, steps away, covers his face. He can\u2019t do this. He can\u2019t watch Sherlock fail. Sherlock can\u2019t fail, he won\u2019t -- He hears Sherlock pacing frantically. They are no closer, and a kid is going to die, and there\u2019s nothing John can do, no gun, no target, no trigger, only Sherlock -- And then: his neck. The back of his neck prickles, shivers trailing down his shoulder blades. He shuts his eyes, willing it to be real. He pinches the bridge of his nose, breathing hard. Too indistinct, maybe his imagination -- He breathes out, a long exhale. The tips of his fingers. Two fingers on his right hand. Just barely numb. Sherlock\u2019s eyes fly open, round and pale and frantic. \u201cOh!\u201d he gasps, a near-painful sound. \u201cOh -- that is brilliant --\u201d It\u2019s something called the Van Buren Supernova. The clock stops. * * * Sherlock curls in his chair, knees drawn up to his chest. The telly blares noise in the background. Lestrade called not long ago. The child is safe, which is the only thing that matters, John reminds himself. The only thing. John hasn\u2019t been able to speak much, since. There were a few words exchanged, to be sure, when they arrived back at the flat a few hours ago. John had examined Sherlock\u2019s neck, checked his eyes with the pen light from his medical bag. Sherlock didn\u2019t protest. \u201cThat was two pips, you realise,\u201d Sherlock says eventually, over the dull roar of the television. \u201cOne pip left.\u201d John doesn\u2019t want to be around to see it. He says nothing, pecks a few keys on his laptop. A final blog entry, or at least the start of one. An explanation is warranted, perhaps, of why he won\u2019t be writing one again. \u201cThree left-handed victims, John.\u201d Sherlock steeples his fingers. \u201cThat has to be significant --\u201d \u201cEnjoy working that out, then.\u201d Sherlock straightens and cranes his neck to look at John, seated at the table. \u201cHmm?\u201d \u201cYou have fun with that,\u201d John says, a bit louder. \u201cBest of luck.\u201d \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d \u201cWell spotted.\u201d John shuts his laptop with a definitive click. \u201cI was wondering when you\u2019d catch on, what with that mighty brain of yours. Or perhaps it\u2019s been a bit -- I don\u2019t know, deprived of oxygen today.\u201d Sherlock turns back to the television. \u201cLet me know when you\u2019ve finished having your tantrum, I\u2019ll order takeaway.\u201d John scoffs, scoots his chair away from the table. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m serious.\u201d \u201cYour knack had a rather unfortunate effect on the Golem,\u201d Sherlock says, unfolding himself from his seat and perching instead on the back of the armchair. \u201cI won\u2019t deny it. But it then had a rather remarkable effect on my final deduction. We saved a child. I would say we\u2019ve come out ahead for the day.\u201d John smiles grimly. \u201cIs that your assessment of how today went, then?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Sherlock says shortly. \u201cNot much different from usual, in sum.\u201d \u201cSo the fact that you weren\u2019t breathing for part of it, not really a low point? How about the fact that I was the reason you weren\u2019t breathing?\u201d \u201cJohn.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s voice rapidly loses its warmth. \u201cI\u2019ve nearly died at least a dozen times since you moved in, not including the day we met. Initially it seemed to be a selling point.\u201d \u201cAnd how many times was it my fault, exactly?\u201d Sherlock\u2019s jaw clenches. \u201cI thought so.\u201d Sherlock exhales sharply. \u201cDo you think I care about that?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d John\u2019s voice hardens into false cheer. \u201cNo, Sherlock, I don\u2019t. And that\u2019s the problem. You don\u2019t care at all that you put me in the position of watching you die because of something I did. You honestly don\u2019t care at all.\u201d Sherlock is on his feet. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to think that way. We had a time limit, John. This bomber is playing a game, laying out traps for my benefit. If I don\u2019t solve his puzzles, people will die, as you so love to remind me. It\u2019s quite simple.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d John says bitterly. \u201cIt is simple. It\u2019s only about the game. About this bomber and your ability to win his game, no matter the cost.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d have me try a different course of action?\u201d Sherlock\u2019s voice hits a perceptibly hoarse edge. \u201cWhat would you suggest, exactly? Inviting our mystery bomber for tea?\u201d \u201cHow about listening to me, for once? How about leaving me in the bloody flat now that we\u2019ve figured out that my presence is a significant risk?\u201d \u201cYour definition of \u2018significant\u2019 is questionable.\u201d \u201cWhat part of \u2018almost got you killed\u2019 is questionable?\u201d Sherlock paces to the window, looks out. \u201cThere are risks involved in every case we take. Your presence is an advantage we can\u2019t afford to waste.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d John shifts in his chair to look at Sherlock. \u201cNo, my presence is an advantage you can\u2019t give up. Just another drug for you, is it? How does it feel, when my knack affects you? Must be one hell of a rush. Once an addict, always an addict, isn\u2019t that what they say?\u201d Sherlock is silent. \u201cIt all makes sense, really,\u201d John adds, something cold and heavy in the pit of his stomach. \u201cWhy someone like you would keep me around. You don\u2019t need an army doctor, not really. Lestrade has a team for autopsies. Quite clever of you, too, that seduction bit. Best way to ensure I stayed around, was that it? Get John in bed, he\u2019ll follow like a bloody lost dog. Was Lestrade in on it? He\u2019s the expert on dogs, after all.\u201d \u201cYou think that\u2019s what happened?\u201d Sherlock says quietly. His gaze is fixed somewhere outside the window; cars, perhaps. Streetlights. \u201cMost logical explanation, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d John gets to his feet. \u201cOtherwise --\u201d He can\u2019t quite say it. He steps into the middle of the room. His left hand clenches reflexively. Sherlock\u2019s voice, from near the window, is startlingly quiet. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, John.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re sorry.\u201d John\u2019s heart is pounding. \u201cFor what? For lying to me all this time?\u201d \u201cI knew about the sniper.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s voice is oddly emotionless. \u201cI had proof your knack was dangerous. I took a chance. I thought you would trust me, and you did. It should have been your choice to make.\u201d John\u2019s stomach drops. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Sherlock turns, framed against the curtain. \u201cThe night I discovered your knack, I called in a favour, got hold of your army records while you were asleep. I wanted to see if there were any patterns, if your knack had inadvertently caused accidents. I read the report of the day you were shot.\u201d John swallows. \u201cAnd?\u201d \u201cReport was that a sniper fired on your unit from an unusual distance. A highly unusual distance. Assumption was that the sniper had some sort of knack related to weapons, or aim. But no knack has ever been documented that\u2019s resulted in such long-range accuracy. The incident was officially classified as unsolved.\u201d \u201cMy knack,\u201d John says. \u201cMy knack... affected the sniper.\u201d Sherlock nods. \u201cYou knew,\u201d John says slowly, \u201cthat I caused most of my unit\u2019s death.\u201d \u201cYou caused it inadvertently.\u201d \u201cYou knew.\u201d \u201cYes. But again, the chance of disaster, given the rest of your history, seemed very slim. A single documented incident in your adult lifetime.\u201d A pause. \u201cI am sorry.\u201d John\u2019s vision swims, spots of black and white. \u201cI watched you die, Sherlock,\u201d he chokes. \u201cI bloody well watched you die in front of me because of something I did -- you, and I love you, Sherlock, and I almost fucking killed you today, and you would have let me.\u201d Sherlock looks out the window again. His calm expression manages to be both chilling and infuriating. \u201cAs I said, it was not deliberate.\u201d \u201cGod, no, of course it wasn\u2019t.\u201d John looks up, shakes his head. \u201c\u2018Sorry, John, it seemed more important to shave ten seconds off my deduction time than to not die.'\" \u201cThose ten seconds were crucial.\u201d \u201cYou knew my own knack got me shot, killed a group of people -- my friends, Sherlock, my bloody unit -- and you argued with me, made me feel like I was insane for wanting to take precautions.\u201d \u201cThere was no time to take precautions.\u201d \u201cNo, Sherlock. The only explanation -- the only one -- is that you were using me. You can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to have a friend nearly die in front of you. Actually die in front of you. Or you wouldn\u2019t have done this.\u201d \u201cYou could have died as well,\u201d Sherlock says quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s very good,\u201d John says. \u201cGood. You\u2019re starting to see my point.\u201d A long pause. \u201cI\u2019m done with this.\u201d John steps backward, gropes for the winter coat draped on the back of his armchair, starts to wrestle it on. \u201cI wish you the best of luck, Sherlock, I do. I hope you can find someone else who makes you think faster, or whatever it is you do, because I\u2019m done with that particular job. I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d Sherlock watches John. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s turned to stone, unreactive, unyielding. A particularly lovely statue in a bespoke shirt and trousers. \u201cBe back for my stuff later,\u201d John says, and he tries to sound casual, but the break in his voice betrays him. He turns and jogs down the stairway to the door and is out into the night before his leg stops working. It buckles under him for a moment; he leans against the railing by the stoop, takes a gulp of breath. His face is wet. John wills his leg to behave. It does, but barely. He limps down Baker Street toward the tube station. He has no destination in mind, but he won\u2019t think about that, not yet. He will step onto the platform and let the trains rattle by, and one of them will take him somewhere. He has never felt like this before. Never in his life. Not even when he was shot. He hasn\u2019t gone a block before a sleek black car pulls up at the kerb next to him, and the door opens. \u201cTell Mycroft he can fuck off,\u201d John yells. A tall, burly man in a dark suit gets out of the car. It\u2019s going to be one of those times, is it? Bloody Mycroft. If this is his attempt at intimidating John into staying, it\u2019s not going to work. The man steps toward John. \u201cGet in the car, please.\u201d \u201cI said,\u201d John says, lifting his chin, \u201cyou can bloody well tell your employer to fuck off.\u201d \u201cHe said you might say something like that,\u201d the man says and looms closer. He appears to be armed. This is unusual. \u201cWhere\u2019s Anthea?\u201d The man says nothing. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out something that looks like a handkerchief. Before John can blink, the man reaches out and grabs the back of John\u2019s head. John flinches in shock, then struggles instinctively, but the man is twice his size.Left the gun in the flat, John thinks. Christ. Left the gun -- The handkerchief covers John\u2019s nose and mouth, and he gags on a sharp, acrid smell. He struggles for two worthless, pungent breaths, and the street goes dark.\n* * *\n\nIt\u2019s still dark. John\u2019s head hurts. He\u2019s warm -- a little too warm. Wrapped up in something. Vague motion, vibration. In a car? A car, perhaps. He shuts his eyes, because his head hurts.\nHe opens his eyes and squints against a bright light. His head pounds. Awkward bulky objects somehow press against his chest and back. He is slumped on a bench in a locker room. It smells strongly of chlorine.\nUsually, at about this point in the dream, John expects his commanding officer to show up and tell his unit to move out. Go north. There will be some combination of sand, noise, and death. And then John will get shot, and he\u2019ll wake up and take two paracetamol for his headache.\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re awake,\u201d says a voice in his ear. It sounds vaguely familiar, but it\u2019s definitely not his commanding officer. John wracks his brain: someone else in his unit? A medical school colleague? His subconscious is really pulling out all the stops for this one. \u201cDecided to join us, Dr Watson?\u201d\nJohn grunts, tries to sit up. It\u2019s difficult. This may be because he\u2019s strapped with explosives.\nHis senses snap to attention fast enough to break the sound barrier. A half-second scan of the situation reveals the locker room to be empty. A cord snakes around the back of John\u2019s neck and up to a device in his ear. He\u2019s wearing a heavy winter coat over a black vest wrapped in a layer of plastic and wire and bricks of Semtex. The coat isn\u2019t his. The thought that someone placed a device in his ear and dressed him in a stranger\u2019s coat is somehow more terrifying than the explosives themselves.\n\u201cYou can relax,\u201d the voice says in his ear, lilting, faintly Irish in accent. \u201cEverything will be just fine as long as you follow orders. You\u2019re a good soldier, aren\u2019t you, Dr Watson? I know you\u2019re so good at following orders.\u201d\nJohn looks around but finds he can\u2019t turn very well, not with the coat\u2019s enormous hood behind him. He knows better than to stand or move very much at all. Must be a camera, somewhere. He nods, once, to show he\u2019s heard.\nThere\u2019s no way out of this. Sherlock was trying to stay one move ahead of the bomber, but John distracted him. The bomber must have been waiting for this opening, and now the game is over. Checkmate.\n\u201cHere\u2019s how we play,\u201d the voice continues. \u201cYou say what I say, when I tell you to speak. Simple. If you don\u2019t do it right, I press a button. You might feel a bit... crispy, when I do that. Might need sunblock. Oh, you didn\u2019t bring any? Such a shame.\u201d The voice shifts from syrup to venom. \u201cAre we quite clear?\u201d\nJohn nods again.\nThe voice slides into syrup once more.\u201cWe\u2019re expecting a visitor in a moment. Stand up, my dear, you\u2019re about to make your grand entrance.\u201d\nJohn straightens. Every muscle in his body protests, and the ones that aren\u2019t cramped and stiff nearly vibrate with tension. It\u2019s sweltering in the locker room. The coat smells of someone else, the invasive musk of a stranger\u2019s sweat, and it\u2019s this more than anything that sends a spike of nausea to the back of John\u2019s throat.\n\u201cStep toward the door.\u201d\nJohn obeys.\nHe hears another door open, and then the sound of footsteps on tile, measured, precise. He knows that gait. But then, John saw this coming. He could see the grand finale the moment he saw the wires on his body.\nSherlock\u2019s voice, dark and resonant, issues from the other side of the door. \u201cI got your message,\u201d he calls. \u201cI\u2019ve brought you something.\u201d\nJohn swallows. A trickle of sweat runs down his temple. At the sound of Sherlock\u2019s voice, the nausea swells unbearably in his throat.\n\u201cAll your little puzzles, making me dance.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s usually cool tone sounds oddly strained. \u201cQuite a brilliant setup. But the cost of playing was a bit much.\u201d\n\u201cOpen the door,\u201d the voice says in John\u2019s ear, and then, a petulant singsong: \u201cSay hello to your boyfriend.\u201d\nJohn opens the door and steps out.\nWater slaps noisily against the tile of an indoor pool, dingy and slick with age. The hot stench of chlorination threatens to overwhelm. Sherlock, at the far end of the room, turns to stare at John. His eyes widen in shock.It\u2019s not like that, John thinks desperately. It\u2019s not what you think, it\u2019s not --\n\u201cRepeat after me,\u201d says the voice in John\u2019s ear. \u201cEvening. This is a turn-up, isn\u2019t it, Sherlock?\u201d\nJohn repeats, swallowing against his gag reflex.\n\u201cJohn,\u201d Sherlock breathes. The look on his face. The look on his face drives out any anger John ever had, anything at all, because Sherlock looks as if someone\u2019s kicked him hard in the gut. He\u2019s never seen this expression on Sherlock\u2019s face before.\nHe never wants to see it again.\n\u201cBet you never saw this coming,\u201d John parrots, every word filling his mouth with bile.\n\u201cShow him what you\u2019ve got behind curtain number one, Johnny,\u201d the voice directs.\nJohn blinks back the sting in his eyes and opens his jacket. The red laser of a sniper\u2019s weapon flickers from nowhere, playing over the twisted wires and chunks of plastic on his chest. I\u2019m sorry, he thinks, hoping Sherlock can read something of the despair in John\u2019s eyes. I\u2019m so sorry.\n\u201cWhat would you like me... to make him say next?\u201d\nSherlock takes a step closer, utterly stricken. \u201cStop,\u201d he says, addressing the unseen voice. \u201cStop. I have what you need. Come and take it. You want me? I\u2019ll do as you like. You don\u2019t need John.\u201d\nA door opens somewhere behind them.\n\u201cWrong!\u201d the voice says, but this time it doesn\u2019t speak through John -- there\u2019s no delay, no sickening rebound of words in John\u2019s head. Now, disembodied, it echoes from the other end of the pool. \u201cYou\u2019ve quite misunderstood the point of the game, Mr Sherlock Holmes. I find myself quite... disappointed.\u201d\nFootsteps against tile.\nJohn can see Sherlock\u2019s reaction: surprise, narrowing quickly to fury. Sherlock lifts John\u2019s gun, points it steadily at a target behind both of them.\n\u201cJim Moriarty,\u201d the voice croons. \u201cHi-i!\u201d\nJohn watches the muscles clench in Sherlock\u2019s jaw.\nThe voice\u2019s owner approaches, steps growing louder behind John, and John\u2019s veins run cold with pure claustrophobic panic. Assailant approaching, and he can\u2019t speak, can\u2019t move, can\u2019t even see the man\u2019s face. May never see his face.\n\u201cJim from IT, remember?\u201dJim from IT. John\u2019s jaw slackens in shock, and he does remember: a forgettable man, deliberately forgettable. The voice ebbs into familiarity as John gropes for the dim memory of a face to match. \u201cThe Jabez Biz case. I believe we didn\u2019t quite meet, Mr Holmes. I know I met Dr Watson. How could I ever forget?\u201d Now the man is at John\u2019s shoulder, but John doesn\u2019t turn his head. \u201cLovely to see you again, John. Always so nice to meet a fellow Lefty.\u201d And now the voice -- Jim -- preens, tilting his head just out of John\u2019s field of vision. \u201cBet you didn\u2019t see this coming. Things aren\u2019t always as they seem, are they?\u201d\nSherlock says nothing, gun still trained firmly on the man next to John. Jim Moriarty, John thinks. The cabbie, so long ago. This is Moriarty.\nMoriarty steps to the side, at long last giving John a partial view of his captor: a dark silhouette, an expensive suit, polished, slick. This man. This man, this mild-mannered IT employee, is their mastermind bomber. Nothing has ever made less sense.\nMoriarty gestures at himself, then holds up one hand. \u201cNot bad for a Lefty, hmm? I\u2019ve just given you a tiny glimpse of what I\u2019ve got going on, Sherlock. I\u2019m a specialist, you see. Like you. A consultant.\u201d\n\u201cConsulting criminal,\u201d Sherlock says quietly. \u201cBrilliant.\u201d\n\u201cConsulting criminal? Oh, you make it all sound so sinister,\u201d Moriarty giggles. \u201cBut I believe we need to have a little business meeting. One consultant to another.\u201d\nSherlock takes one hand off the gun and reaches into his suit pocket, then holds up the memory stick from Joe Harrison\u2019s flat. \u201cI told you,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got what you want. The missile plans.\u201d\n\u201cOh, those!\u201d Moriarty singsongs. He steps forward, blithely ignoring the weapon pointing at his head, and now John can see a slim, inconsequential frame, the back of a neat haircut, a ghost-pale neck against the fine collar of a crisp white shirt.\n\u201cTake it,\u201d Sherlock says coolly.\nMoriarty snatches the memory stick from Sherlock\u2019s outstretched hand and holds it up, turning it between thumb and forefinger with the air of a child about to skip a stone. \u201cBo-ring!\u201d He flips it offhandedly into the pool. \u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong, Sherlock. That\u2019s not what I want at all.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what you want,\u201d Sherlock repeats flatly.\n\u201cGod, no. Do you think I went to all this trouble for some run-of-the-mill classified plans? I\u2019m insulted, really I am. Don\u2019t you think better of me, after all this time? No, I know what I want.\u201d Moriarty\u2019s posture shifts, and his voice shifts with it, drawing out words as if pulling wings from an insect. \u201cThe undivided attention of the world\u2019s only consulting detective.\u201d\n\u201cI think you can be reasonably confident that you have it,\u201d Sherlock says dryly. \u201cWhat do you plan on doing with it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t resist seeing you in the flesh, Sherlock Holmes,\u201d Moriarty leers. \u201cI mean, who could? Your cheekbones are the stuff of legend, and those eyes, I mean, don\u2019t get me started, right, Dr Watson?\u201d He nudges John\u2019s bulky jacket conspiratorially, and John flushes with a mix of fury and discomfort. \u201cBut I thought I\u2019d arrange this meeting so I could convey a message.\u201d Moriarty puts his hands in his pockets, rocks back on his heels. \u201cBack off.\u201d\n\u201cYou make that remarkably difficult.\u201d\n\u201cAll the same.\u201d\n\u201cWhy,\u2019 Sherlock says slowly, and John\u2019s brain races, careening along a similar path for once -- \u201cwhy would you seek me out, construct these elaborate schemes for my benefit, if you want me to leave you alone?\u201d\nMoriarty steps back and leans in to whisper in John\u2019s ear, the ear that\u2019s not already fitted to transmit his voice. Blood pounds against the wall of John\u2019s skull. \u201cHe\u2019s smart, isn\u2019t he? I can see why you like him. Always thinking.\u201d\nHis breath lingers far too close to John\u2019s skin, raising hairs on John\u2019s arms. It sends the cold, violating lance of a shiver down the sweat-drenched back of John\u2019s neck.\nMoriarty straightens, adjusts his tie, and cricks his neck to one side. He glances at John with eyebrows raised, a knowing flash of a grin, before he turns back to address Sherlock again.\n\u201cSorry, your doctor is so distracting. I didn\u2019t answer your question, did I? Because, Sherlock, without a game, you wouldn\u2019t have taken me seriously. You wouldn\u2019t know what I\u2019m capable of. And I do love playing games, but not everything is a game. Do you know what happens if you don\u2019t leave me alone?\u201d\nSherlock rolls his eyes. \u201cLet me guess. You kill me. How dull.\u201d\nJohn shuts his eyes. He feels a helplessness almost indistinguishable from physical pain. His head won\u2019t stop pounding, a queasy throb of panic and despair.\nThe bottom drops out of Moriarty\u2019s voice, savage and raw. \u201cNo, Sherlock, I will burn you.\u201d The words curl with poison. \u201cI\u2019ll burn the heart out of you.\u201d\nPrimal instinct bypasses all thought. John lunges forward and grips Moriarty around the chest in a desperate bear hug. \u201cRun, Sherlock,\u201d he gasps between gritted teeth.\nSharp corners of Semtex dig into John\u2019s chest as Moriarty crows with glee. \u201cOh, very good!\u201d he exclaims, as they sway, off-balance.\nSherlock doesn\u2019t move. He glances up, watching the beam from the sniper rifle.\nThe pressure in John\u2019s head might well break his skull. Moriarty will die, he thinks, bracing himself as the man struggles in his grasp. Moriarty --\nThe pressure builds, pounding in his temples. Moriarty, he thinks again, and feels a distinctly odd, now-familiar sensation at the back of his neck.\nIt feels as if his entire brain is about to sneeze.Not that, he thinks. Not the knack, not now -- not with a sniper, for God\u2019s sake, not now --\nThe sensation dissipates.\nJohn is utterly stunned. He is nearly stunned enough to forget that he\u2019s wrapped in explosives and clutching a criminally insane psychopath. He fixes Sherlock with an urgent look and wishes he could tell him what just happened, but there\u2019s the business of dying to attend to. \u201cIf your sniper pulls the trigger, Mr Moriarty, then we both go up,\u201d John grits out.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he sweet?\u201d Moriarty croons, grunting as John pulls him closer. \u201cI can see why you like having him around. So loyal. But -- oops!\u201d\nThe dancing red light of the sniper\u2019s laser vanishes from John\u2019s chest. It reappears, instead, on Sherlock\u2019s forehead.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve rather shown your hand, there, Dr Watson,\u201d Moriarty says, leaning lazily back in John\u2019s locked arms against the bulky Semtex.\nJohn drops his hands, steps back. The laser dances back to the explosives on his vest. Moriarty steps away and brushes off his expensive suit.\nNo way out. If only John could think --\nSherlock. Sherlock can think. Maybe Sherlock could think for the both of them.\nJohn shuts his eyes, hears the echo of pool water, and casts about for a ghost of the pressure he\u2019d felt. It\u2019s one thing to be plunged into a dream; it\u2019s another to go looking for one.\nAnd then, something: something wavering on the border of imagination, something not quite real. Just as quickly, it\u2019s gone.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s been fun, boys, really, it has,\u201d Moriarty says jovially, looking from Sherlock to John. \u201cAll good things, though -- you know what they say. Time for me to take my party favour and go home.\u201d\nJohn swallows, and with the act, a faint pressure returns. It moves indistinctly, first over one eyebrow, and then to the back of his head. It\u2019s easier to recognize now, but just as easily slips away. Sand through fingertips.\nWorst case, John could trigger the sniper with his knack. But he could trigger Sherlock instead. And that\u2019s a chance worth taking.\nSherlock shifts his weight, steadies the gun.\nA sharp, electric jolt rockets down John\u2019s spine. His pulse jumps as a kiss of numb sensation trails through his fingertips. Hope and panic paralyse him in equal, overwhelming amounts. Sherlock, he thinks. Please, God, let it be Sherlock this time --\nA sharp, quick intake of breath. \u201cOh,\u201d Sherlock says. His eyes are very, very wide. \u201cOh --\u201d and John can\u2019t help himself, nearly grins outright.\nHis aim has always been excellent.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to kill John,\u201d Sherlock says evenly.\n\u201cInteresting theory,\u201d Moriarty croons, but there\u2019s a note in his voice that gives John pause. \u201cEspecially considering he\u2019s the one here strapped with explosives. But it\u2019s a lovely thought.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to kill John,\u201d Sherlock repeats, \u201cbecause you want to take him with you. He\u2019s the prize in this little game. The \u2018party favour,\u2019 so to speak.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s heart takes up its wild racket once more. He stares at Sherlock in disbelief.\nMoriarty, for once, remains jarringly silent. The set of his shoulders shifts.\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Sherlock says, a faint smile at the corner of his mouth. \u201cThese tests, these complicated crimes, the time limits, the careful clues. It all seems a bit too much work to lure me in, just to tell me to stay away. No, you had a different motive. You knew something. You wanted to watch us work. You wanted to watch John.\u201d\nSherlock takes a step forward, still training the gun on Moriarty. \u201cYou were interested enough in me at the outset, to be sure. Perhaps I was the original motivation for your little project -- it was certainly designed for my interests. But something happened, something that shifted your focus. You met John Watson and detonated your first bomb that very same day.\u201d\n\u201cBrilliant storyteller, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Moriarty says, half in John\u2019s ear, something faintly rabid in his tone. \u201cTrying to flatter you? Make it all up to you? I\u2019ve heard he hasn\u2019t been the most considerate of partners.\u201d\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t resist leaving a clue,\u201d Sherlock continues, his smile growing slightly wider. \u201cA clever little calling card. Three left-handed victims. A hint that perhaps Lefties are worth a second look. Because you know that John is not truly left-handed -- and you know because you aren\u2019t, either.\u201d\nMoriarty walks slowly toward Sherlock, three long, measured steps, and stops. He puts his hands in his pockets and tilts his head wonderingly. \u201cSherlock Holmes.\u201d The name is a dagger, a sharp, dangerous thing. \u201cSeems I didn\u2019t underestimate you after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not naturally left-handed.\u201d Sherlock is in the throes of deduction now, an easy, rapid patter of speech at odds with his firm grip on John\u2019s gun. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been left-handed, have you, Jim? You were born as right-handed as anyone else, but at a very young age you must have realised it would be to your advantage to conceal your ability. You managed to fool the testing panel in primary school -- impressive, but not too difficult, considering that they\u2019re probably not watching out for children pretending to be left-handed. And now you\u2019ve played Lefty so long, your body has adapted, and it\u2019s second nature.\n\u201cSo you have a knack, this much is clear, and it\u2019s a knack that would enable you to instantly know that John is not a normal left-handed individual. More than that: John would be useful to you. Very useful.\u201d\n\u201cOooooh,\u201d Moriarty breathes, nearly bouncing on the balls of his feet. \u201cYou are good. Really good, Sherlock. It was a lovely plan, wasn\u2019t it? I knew you\u2019d fall for it. That\u2019s your... weakness.\u201d He bites off this word decadently, as if it\u2019s a delicious joke. \u201cYou always want everything to be clever. Now, shall we finish the game?\u201d\nMoriarty spins toward John, sinking into a mock-bow, then straightens, hooking an invasive arm into the crook of John\u2019s elbow. He pulls John close to his side. \u201cI always did want a pet. I was never allowed to have one as a child, not after that time with the cat and the sewing scissors.\u201d He drops his chin onto John\u2019s shoulder and blinks up at him owlishly as John stares resolutely ahead. \u201cHow about it, Johnny? My... right-hand man?\u201d\nJohn doesn\u2019t move. It\u2019s building within him again, that about-to-sneeze sensation. John can tell, now, how easy it is to mistake for something else, how much it seems like imagination, some strange phantom hiccup of mood. But Moriarty has a knack, and apparently a dangerous one -- this is no time to take chances. John\u2019s got to dissipate the pressure right now, unless he can be absolutely sure that this thing he can do, whatever it is, will find Sherlock, and Sherlock alone.\nSomehow, without knowing how, he is sure.\nLike aiming a gun, but no, not really. Like shining a torch, adjusting the beam, and watching Sherlock in the light, pale eyes like steel, one damp curl stuck slightly to his forehead. If they get through this, John thinks, he\u2019ll brush that curl away, press his lips to that spot.\nWhen he shivers, this time, it\u2019s not a surprise, but the fact that it\u2019s not is surprising.\nSherlock\u2019s eyes widen, and this time he looks at John. The faintest arc of an eyebrow.\nJohn nods, just barely.\nSherlock\u2019s mouth twitches in a near-grin.\n\u201cOne more thing, though, Mr Moriarty,\u201d Sherlock says smoothly. \u201cAbout your knack. You may want to use it right now. I believe you\u2019ll be able to tell that John won\u2019t be of much use to you anymore.\u201d\nAbruptly, Moriarty loosens his hold on John\u2019s arm, then drops it. He turns, wide-eyed, to stare at Sherlock.\n\u201cOh, and my brother might be particularly interested in your remarkable ability,\u201d Sherlock adds. \u201cEspecially since, I believe, it\u2019s gone undocumented. But I\u2019m sure he could find a way to change that.\u201d He pauses, and the hint of a smile steals across his face. \u201cI believe you\u2019ve rather shown your hand.\u201d\nThe sniper laser continues to dance across the wires on John\u2019s chest.\nMoriarty drags a hand slowly across his face. \u201cSo nice to have had a proper chat,\u201d he says, at last. He takes a few steps backward, easing behind John, and then his footsteps begin to recede, slow, deliberate, and then stop.\n\u201cMust say, though, I am a teensy bit disappointed. Dr Watson would have brought a little light to my workplace. So much more fun than a goldfish.\u201d\nA door behind John opens and clicks shut.\nSherlock stares at John, starts to slowly lower the gun.\nThe door opens again.\n\u201cMe again,\u201d Moriarty calls, his voice once again soft and malleable. \u201cI\u2019m so changeable... that\u2019s my weakness. Just wanted to say, I\u2019d kill you now, but it seems so dull. I owe you something far, far more special to mark the occasion.\u201d A soft chuckle. \u201cThese ideas do occur at the strangest of times. Ciao, Sherlock Holmes. Dr Watson.\u201d\n\u201cCatch... you... later,\u201d Sherlock says.\nThe door, once again, clicks shut. The red flickering light vanishes.\nThey wait for what seems like the longest beat of time in recorded history. Pool water laps quietly against the tiles. Then they exhale together, a single, shared breath. Sherlock darts forward, kneeling to fumble with the fastenings of John\u2019s cumbersome, deadly outerwear. \u201cAll right?\u201d\nJohn can hardly get enough oxygen into his lungs. The vest falls open and Sherlock wrests the coat from his shoulders, flings it to the ground a fair distance away. The absence of it is bliss, a rush of air hitting John\u2019s sweat-damp, compressed button-down and jumper. John sways on his feet. Fainting is certainly an option, one that isn\u2019t far away.\n\u201cJohn. All right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d John says, and Sherlock is out the door, the same one Moriarty used, just as John\u2019s leg gives out again. John staggers, curses, and slides down the wall, dropping his head between his knees. The earpiece is still snaked around his neck, a cord tethering him to Moriarty. He yanks it away roughly and hurls it toward the lifeless vest.\nSherlock returns almost immediately. The gun is still in his hand, seemingly forgotten, more limb than weapon. He looks paler than John\u2019s ever seen him, almost clammy. \u201cYou all right?\u201d John manages.\n\u201cWhat? Yeah.\u201d Sherlock paces, breathing hard, and gestures absently with the gun. \u201cThat thing -- that thing you did. With your knack. You -- Twice. On purpose?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. On purpose.\u201d\n\u201cThat was -- that was amazing.\u201d Sherlock stops, then, looks down, and grins at John. A big, open-hearted grin. The single best sight John\u2019s ever seen.\nSherlock slides the gun back into his jacket, leans down, and holds out a hand. John takes it.\n* * *\nLife gets in the way, first.\nThere\u2019s a cab ride, and during it, an exponentially long phone call to Lestrade which Sherlock conducts half-slumped in his seat, voice still lively, but body betraying him. John drifts in and out, watching the unfamiliar lights of the suburb roadway give way to the comfort of more well-trodden landmarks, London pulling them back into the centre of her beating heart.\nAfter some time Sherlock reaches out, still on the phone, and draws John against his side. It\u2019s chilly in the back of the cab, and John doesn\u2019t have a coat. John lets his head drop against Sherlock\u2019s warm shoulder, feels Sherlock\u2019s hand close firmly around his upper arm. When he opens his eyes again, they\u2019re home.\nThere\u2019s the mundane business of paying the cab fare and fumbling with keys, because it\u2019s bloody cold outside, and stumbling up seventeen steps, and shutting doors and shucking a coat, and then of course Sherlock\u2019s phone rings again.\nJohn starts a fire while Sherlock takes the phone call, because it doesn\u2019t take much thought, and he doesn\u2019t have much thought left to give. Also, he\u2019s still cold, which is odd, because at the pool he thought he\u2019d never feel cold again. He prods the newly lit kindling and straightens up to see Sherlock watching him with a solemn, unreadable expression.\n\u201cSo how did you find me?\u201d John asks, suddenly uneasy at the grave look at Sherlock\u2019s face.\n\u201cPink phone.\u201d Sherlock takes it out of his pocket, sets it on the table next to him. \u201cLast pip. Photo of the pool.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nSilence stretches between them.\n\u201cYour things,\u201d Sherlock says flatly. \u201cYou\u2019ll be needing to pack, I expect.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s stomach lurches. \u201cWhat?\u201d he whispers.\n\u201cEarlier,\u201d Sherlock says, and he looks puzzled. \u201cEarlier, you said --\u201d\nBut he can\u2019t speak anymore, because John grips his lapels and drags him down into a fierce, bruising kiss, rough enough that Sherlock stumbles and John\u2019s leg nearly gives way again.\n\u201cYou bloody idiot,\u201d John breathes at last, craning up to smooth a dark curl away from Sherlock\u2019s forehead and kiss the spot underneath. He\u2019d made an appointment with that spot, and he was over an hour late for it. \u201cDoes it look like I want to move out?\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s brow furrows in confusion, but the corners of his eyes crinkle, and he chuckles breathlessly. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cTell me if you need any help with that deduction,\u201d John murmurs.\nSherlock\u2019s answer is to pull John against him, hard. With the force of Sherlock\u2019s grasp, John expects urgent lips pressed against his, but there are none. Instead, Sherlock\u2019s long arms twine around him in an iron grip so firm John can barely breathe, and he buries his head in the crook of John\u2019s neck.\nThey stay there for a very long time.\nAt last John feels Sherlock\u2019s chest rise in a deep, uneven breath, and Sherlock pulls back a bit, looking down at him. \u201cYou said it to me,\u201d Sherlock says darkly, bright eyes scanning John\u2019s face. \u201cAnd I wanted to tell you -- and I never did.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d John says, finding it startlingly hard to speak.\n\u201cAnd what you said, about watching your friends die in front of you --\u201d Sherlock says, but doesn\u2019t finish.\nSome time later, John eases his grip from Sherlock\u2019s waist and looks up. Sherlock is watching him with a wistful, broken smile.\nJohn reaches up, runs his fingertips along one damp, sharp cheekbone. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u201cMmm.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d John cracks a smile, just as broken as Sherlock\u2019s. Sherlock relaxes his hold a bit, shifts his feet, but seems perfectly happy to keep John in the circle of his arms indefinitely. John finds he doesn\u2019t mind.\n\u201cJust one thing,\u201d John says, and Sherlock\u2019s eyebrows rise. \u201cAt the pool. You figured out Moriarty\u2019s knack?\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s smile broadens, and his eyes light with pleasure. It occurs to John that Sherlock has been waiting patiently for this very question.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI explained everything to Lestrade, but you may have been sleeping.\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Sherlock releases John at last, a bit reluctantly. He wears a look that John knows well, and it\u2019s with unconscious understanding that John steps away to lean on his armchair.\n\u201cMoriarty\u2019s knack,\u201d Sherlock says gravely, turning to face John, \u201cis quite simple, but rather dangerous. He can detect another person\u2019s weakness.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s brow furrows. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever your weakest point might be, your Achilles heel, whatever he could use to best exploit you -- Moriarty can detect it.\u201d\n\u201cHow the hell did you figure that out?\u201d\nSherlock stops pacing, tilts his head in acknowledgement. \u201cI had help.\u201d\nJohn flushes. \u201cYeah, but you had to be the one to actually work it out.\u201d\nA flash of a grin. \u201cIt was a simple logic problem. Given Moriarty\u2019s behaviour, it seemed highly likely that he\u2019d guessed your knack when he\u2019d met you. But how? When you first encountered Moriarty, I hadn\u2019t yet deduced your knack. Mycroft, even with his Analyst ability, couldn\u2019t detect your knack. Moriarty, therefore, had to have some other type of ability that would instantly reveal your knack to him in an utterly unconventional way.\n\u201cSo, what can we infer about this ability? The nature of Moriarty\u2019s knack would have to be such that he\u2019d be highly motivated to conceal its powers. And it would have to be one that could easily be concealed, as yours is.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d John nods. \u201cI\u2019m following.\u201d\n\u201cIt occurred to me, after you -- after you left, how right you were about your knack being dangerous,\u201d Sherlock continues, and then cuts himself off in exasperation, waving a hand. \u201cDamn -- yes, \u2018left, right,\u2019 pun totally unintentional, can we go on?\u201d\n\u201cBy all means,\u201d John says, coughing feebly in an attempt to contain outright laughter.\nSherlock pauses to lean against the back of his own chair, and though a corner of his mouth lifts in a smile, his mood is serious enough that John\u2019s mirth is snuffed like a candle. \u201cYour knack seemed such a tremendous advantage, at first, but I -- I was wrong. It can be a strength, yes, but it can also be a weakness. And, since you couldn\u2019t control it -- at the time,\u201d Sherlock adds, \u201cperhaps, then, more of a weakness than a strength. Your greatest weakness, in fact.\u201d\n\u201cSo Moriarty sensed my knack when he met me,\u201d John says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s my greatest weakness?\u201d\n\u201cWas your greatest weakness,\u201d Sherlock corrects.\n\u201cWas.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I believe Moriarty had an immediate sense of your knack, when you first met -- near-instant, probably -- because your knack enhanced his ability to detect it. At that particular moment in time, your knack was your greatest point of vulnerability because it was unknown to you. And because it amplified Moriarty\u2019s knack, he sensed it right away.\u201d\nJohn looks down briefly and studies his hands, still gripping the armchair. \u201cThat\u2019s, er. That\u2019s a bit much to process.\u201d\nSherlock climbs over the back of his chair, perches on it. \u201cMoriarty may have initially been pursuing me, but shifted his plan as soon as you came into view. Your knack could have potentially enabled him to be even more effective in his exploits.\u201d\n\u201cBecause he\u2019d be able to read people... faster. More easily.\u201d\n\u201cImpossible to tell precisely how you affect him, but yes.\u201d\nJohn nods. \u201cRight. So all the cases, all the bombs -- why did he go to so much trouble?\u201d He swallows. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he just take me right away?\u201d\n\u201cFor one thing, he wanted to distract me,\u201d Sherlock says with a hint of guilt, \u201cand I was his initial target, after all. His little game, as he called it, worked out rather in his favour, because he needed to make sure of a few things before running off with you. For one, whether you knew about your ability or not. And if you did know, whether you could control it. The more he watched, the more he could see that your presence improved my abilities. And that you had no control over your knack whatsoever. The ideal scenario.\u201d\n\u201cGod.\u201d John rubs the back of his neck. \u201cMakes me feel like a prize goose.\u201d\nSherlock chuckles, and his eyes glint when they meet John\u2019s. \u201cSomething like that, yes. Don\u2019t take it personally.\u201d\nJohn raises his eyebrows. Sherlock raises one in return.\n\u201cYou got all that,\u201d John says, \u201cbecause you knew Moriarty figured out my knack in the moment we met.\u201d\nSherlock very nearly flushes. \u201cWell, he also hinted at it quite clumsily during our little chat this evening, but yes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then you asked him to use his knack at the pool,\u201d John says slowly. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cObvious. I could tell you\u2019d managed to gain some measure of control over your knack, because I\u2019d felt its effects twice in a short span of time. And if you have control over it...\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer my weakness,\u201d John finishes. \u201cI\u2019d refuse to use it on Moriarty. He\u2019d have to force me.\u201d\n\u201cYou become a much less appealing prize,\u201d Sherlock agrees. \u201cAnd I was right. As soon as he saw that things had changed, he decided his plan wasn\u2019t worth it anymore.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d John says reflexively, because Sherlock always is. And then, after a moment: \u201c...No. No, wait, Sherlock.\u201d\nSherlock unfolds himself from the back of his chair, walks a few steps toward the fire and prods at it with an iron.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nJohn straightens, steps back from his armchair. \u201cMoriarty would have had ways to make me work for him,\u201d he says. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have had any qualms about threatening me, or torturing me. That\u2019s not the whole reason he left. There could have been something else.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s insane,\u201d Sherlock says curtly.\n\u201cYour weakness,\u201d John says. \u201cSherlock, you told him to use his knack. He\u2019d have seen your weakness as well as mine. Maybe --\u201d\n\u201cMoriarty already knows my weakness,\u201d Sherlock says. His eyes reflect firelight. \u201cHe said so. I can\u2019t resist the lure of a puzzle.\u201d\nJohn tilts his head, steps closer. His phone, forgotten on the kitchen table, chirps.\n\u201cMycroft,\u201d he says, momentarily distracted. \u201cDoes Mycroft know any of this?\u201d\n\u201cHe will,\u201d Sherlock says, managing to look only slightly resentful. \u201cHe should. Much as I hate to admit it, he can help you. World\u2019s leading expert on knacks, apparently. A fact he would never let me forget.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s phone chirps again. He sighs, retrieves it. The fire pops pleasantly as Sherlock sheds his jacket, starts to roll up his shirtsleeves.Requesting your presence at a meeting tomorrow morning, 10 AM. MHHave cancelled your patients for the next week. MH\nJohn sighs, gives a weary laugh. \u201cSeems as if Mycroft\u2019s gotten word of things already.\u201d\n\u201cMmm. Lestrade\u2019s doing, I imagine.\u201d\nAnother chirp. Pleased to hear there will be no change of address required for your primary residence. MH\nJohn reads it aloud. He\u2019s grinning by the time he reaches the end of the line.\nHe hears Sherlock\u2019s low chuckle from across the room. \u201cThat\u2019s about the equivalent of Mycroft sending flowers, I hope you know.\u201d\nJohn laughs. \u201cI suppose I should be honoured.\u201d\nSherlock snorts. \u201cHe\u2019s hardly worth it.\u201dTomorrow, 10 AM. Thanks, Mycroft. JW\nJohn hits \u201csend,\u201d sets his phone back on the table. The fire pops again. Without warning, exhaustion slams into him, not a slow, gentle wave, but an abrupt collision. He puts a hand on the kitchen table, leans his weight on it, and shuts his eyes briefly. \u201cChrist. I think everything just hit me at once.\u201d\nHe hears Sherlock\u2019s murmured assent, and opens his eyes. Sherlock is watching him from the sitting room, and something about the set of his shoulders mirrors John\u2019s fatigue.\nSherlock takes a step forward, nods in the direction of his bedroom. His hands are in his pockets, shirtsleeves rolled to his elbows, the top button of his shirt undone. The firelight casts his pale skin in rosy, shifting shadows. \u201cCome to bed,\u201d he says.\nDespite his exhaustion, warmth rockets through John at the low note in Sherlock\u2019s voice, battling the soreness in every muscle. A slow flush of arousal quickens his pulse, even as his body protests.\nThe most urgent matter, suddenly: he\u2019s a mess. Before he can even think of how to reconcile the need for sleep and the need to rip off every last button of Sherlock\u2019s white dress shirt, he needs to rid himself of the stink of chlorine and panic.\n\u201cI need a shower,\u201d he says, more to himself than to anyone else.\nSherlock\u2019s expression, unguarded and soft, shifts quickly to disappointment.\nJohn\u2019s eyes widen. This is all still new. He\u2019s unused to seeing Sherlock this way, unsure, tentative. In this, they\u2019re finding their way. They\u2019ve barely had a chance to try.\nThere have been a few distractions lately.\n\u201cYou\u2019re, er. Invited,\u201d John says, meeting Sherlock\u2019s gaze deliberately. \u201cI just -- my clothes. I smell a bit like the pool. And, er... explosives.\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s expression softens again, an endearing mix of nerves and relief. John gives a hesitant smile. \u201cOnly if you want to, that is.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll join you in a minute,\u201d Sherlock says, with a slight nod, and an even slighter smile in return.\nTen minutes later John\u2019s vision is fogged with steam, hot shower water hitting him between his shoulderblades like some sort of heavenly gift. He can\u2019t remember when he last ate or slept, but it doesn\u2019t seem to matter. The dry crust of sweat and chlorine is gone, swirling down the drain with traces of soap and shampoo.\nThe bathroom door opens, closes, and a hand pulls aside a corner of the shower curtain. \u201cJohn?\u201d\n\u201cC\u2019mon in.\u201d\nSherlock steps into the tub and closes the curtain. He\u2019s utterly naked, all long lengths of wiry muscle, a dramatic sweep of hipbones. Shockingly vulnerable. John nearly sways on the spot.\nSherlock waits, John\u2019s body blocking most of the water, tiny droplets spraying Sherlock\u2019s dark curls, his pale shoulders. \u201cDo you need --\u201d he says, muscles drawn tight. \u201cThat is, I --\u201d\n\u201cLet me,\u201d John says, bar of soap still in his hand. \u201cCome here.\u201d\nHe reaches forward, slides the soap over Sherlock\u2019s chest, down the hard, solid length of his torso, back up again along the ridges of ribs, the deep vault of his ribcage. He sets down the soap, hands covered in suds, and draws Sherlock a step closer, running slippery hands down his sides; closer, even, to cup Sherlock\u2019s arse. Sherlock\u2019s cock is hard, rosy, slightly curved between them, pressing urgently against John\u2019s belly. John wraps a slick, soapy hand around it, and Sherlock gasps.\nThen, a dizzy dream of fog and steam, hot pounding water and warm slippery hands. Sherlock drops his head back as John strokes him gently. He half-groans, a low, helpless sound, and soon he is shuddering, spent and limp, his hands fumbling for John in the steam. It\u2019s only moments before John follows, clutching Sherlock\u2019s slippery waist.\nThey stumble out of the shower, warm, tingling. John feels as if he\u2019s floating, no longer tethered to his body, which must have washed away in bliss and soap.\nA few moments later they are sliding into Sherlock\u2019s smooth, cool sheets, and John\u2019s not entirely sure what he\u2019s done to deserve this -- although maybe spending the day in and out of mortal peril should result in some sort of half-decent karmic payback. But when Sherlock slips a warm, still-damp leg against his and crowds close to him, John realises he couldn\u2019t have conceived of karma quite as sublime as this.\n\u201cYour knack,\u201d Sherlock says, his hands roaming deftly under the sheets, absently exploring John\u2019s bare torso. It\u2019s distracting in the best possible way. \u201cHow did you figure out how to control it? Do you think your control is... reliable?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d John admits. \u201cIt was a matter of... recognizing how it felt.\u201d He tries to find words for the strange, indistinct pressure he remembers. \u201cI had to realise that certain things weren\u2019t just my imagination. Once I could identify the feeling, it started to get easier to sense it. And once I could sense it, at the pool, I found I could... dissipate the feeling, make it go away. And then I got a bit of a hold on how to direct it. Somehow I think it was easier, since you were the target. I think -- I think you\u2019re an easy target for me.\u201d\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d Sherlock murmurs. \u201cEntirely different from my knack. I can\u2019t make mine stop, but there\u2019s no need.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s constantly active?\u201d\n\u201cMmm. With peaks of activity, to be sure.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that exhausting?\u201d\nIn the dark, John can hear the grin in Sherlock\u2019s voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know what life is like without it, so: no, not really.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s eyes feel heavy. He huffs a laugh. \u201cThat explains a lot.\u201d\n\u201cCan you do it now?\u201d Sherlock\u2019s long feet are against his shins. It\u2019s strangely pleasant.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d John may be drifting off. Sherlock\u2019s words seem to be shifting into surrealism.\nA smooth hand on his neck, skimming his shoulder. \u201cCan you... set off your knack?\u201d\nJohn blinks. \u201cI -- er. Now? Bloody hell, Sherlock.\u201d\nSherlock doesn\u2019t respond. Instead, he slides his hand down John\u2019s shoulder and over his forearm before taking John\u2019s left hand in his own. John\u2019s pulse starts to quicken. \u201cUnfair,\u201d John protests, but Sherlock grins wickedly and draws John\u2019s index finger between his lips. The resulting tapestry of curses provokes a deep, rumbling laugh from Sherlock.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d John gasps, as Sherlock slides his tongue along the next finger. \u201cOkay. I can\u2019t -- Oh, Christ -- I can\u2019t promise anything.\u201d\nSherlock releases John\u2019s hand with a final swipe of his tongue. His eyes glint in the the faint light thrown from the lone window, and he nods in acknowledgement.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re doing that again later,\u201d John adds.\nAnother deep laugh. \u201cOff you go.\u201d\nJohn takes a breath, waits a bit for his pulse to recover. He tries to think of pressure, where it might have left a trace of itself. A faint imprint, maybe, above one eyebrow. A shadow of something in the way he\u2019s holding his shoulder. All too quickly, it fades.\n\u201cLost it,\u201d he mutters. \u201cSorry. Hang on.\u201d\nBut the memory of it is there, creeping back, and it\u2019s the memory itself that starts to build, take form, and eventually have weight. And then it\u2019s there, behind John\u2019s eyes, pulsing gently, and all he has to do is aim. A torch, through darkness. He coughs, and the tips of his fingers tingle. Right hand, this time. Just a bit.\nSherlock\u2019s eyes widen, as John knew they would.\nAnd then Sherlock smiles, an odd little bittersweet smile that makes something catch in John\u2019s throat.\n\u201cDid it work?\u201d John knows the answer, but he still wants to hear it.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWell?\u201d John shifts a bit closer, trying not to lose himself entirely in the afterglow of success. \u201cWhat did you get? Anything interesting?\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Sherlock says.\n\u201cMe.\u201d\n\u201cSpecifically, us.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be deliberately cryptic, Sherlock, I can easily forget how to do this for the next case.\u201d\nSherlock sighs. \u201cMike Stamford.\u201d\n\u201cConsider this your second warning,\u201d John murmurs. His eyes, now closed, feel nearly as heavy as his limbs. \u201cWhat\u2019s Stamford got to do with anything?\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s voice has a smile in it. \u201cDo you know Stamford\u2019s knack?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d John knows Mike well enough, to be sure, but they hadn\u2019t ever broached the topic. People tend to avoid talking knacks with a Lefty.\n\u201cHe connects people,\u201d Sherlock says. \u201cUsually for practical purposes. Study partners, carpools. Casual friendships, if he knows two compatible people. Occasionally, he makes a romantic match, but it\u2019s relatively rare.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI figured it out fairly early on, after I\u2019d first met him. That\u2019s why I asked him for help in finding a flatmate.\u201d\n\u201cThat day I ran into him in the park.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d A pause.\nJohn\u2019s eyes fly open. \u201cMy knack. Sherlock --\u201d\n\u201cWhen you met Mike at the park,\u201d Sherlock says, but John\u2019s mind is flying, skimming over old voices -- \u201cCome on. Who\u2019d want me for a flatmate?\u201d -- and his shoulder, his shoulder had hurt like hell, right there on the bench --\n\u201cWhat happens,\u201d John interrupts, \u201cwhen someone\u2019s ability to connect people... is enhanced?\u201d\nSherlock\u2019s lips, against his forehead: a deep whisper.\n\u201cThis.\u201d\n* * *"
