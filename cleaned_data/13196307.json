    "text": "The world is grey.\nWhen she wakes up at Pemberley in the morning, the sky is iron, the air is stifling, the walls are bleak. She gets dressed\u2014well, her maid dresses her. Her maid is grey\u2014well, the maid\u2019s eyes are grey, and she hardly talks. To be honest, Elizabeth hardly talks to the maid either.\n\nThen Elizabeth goes down for breakfast, and the food has no taste. It is strange. Food tasted good before; she remembers how ravenous she was, at Longbourn, her childhood home, eating in the morning with her parents and noisy sisters. After a brisk walk, coffee tasted like luxury and strength, bread smelled like kitchen and laughter, butter and honey.\n\nAnd there is butter and honey at Pemberley, of course. And much more\u2014an elegant display of much more\u2014but nothing feels real; everything seems to be drowned in grey tones. Maybe it is the season. February. February is a bad month\u2014always. It is the month where people starve because winter provisions run out. It is the month where lovelorn maids hang themselves in the attic. It happened once\u2014not at Longbourn but at Lucas Lodge; Elizabeth was only thirteen, but she understood.\n\nFebruary is the month where she is eating breakfast, at Pemberley, alone.\n\nWith three footmen and her husband. Who does not look at her. Or maybe he does. But she certainly does not look at him.\n\nThough, nobody could say that Elizabeth Bennet (Darcy) is not always perfectly polite.\n\n\u201cWould you like some more coffee, Mr Darcy?\u201d she asks, with a smile.\n\nOf course, she must look at him now. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he answers.\n\nShe smiles again. Then she eats.\n\nThe world is grey beneath the windows\u2019 panes. The air is grey in the room. She can hardly breathe.\n\n\u201cI like red,\u201d she says. \u201cI wonder where all the red has gone?\u201d\n\nShe thinks her husband is looking at her. \u201cIt is winter,\u201d he murmurs.\n\nShe just says, \u201cI understand.\u201d\n\nShe finishes eating and goes back through the grey, silent halls of the grey, silent mansion.\n\n**\n\n\u201cElizabeth, you have changed,\u201d Jane said, when Elizabeth visited her, three months ago. Jane lives far away. She has a husband. Not Mr Bingley. Jane is with child.\n\nJane is far away.\n\nJane lives behind a wall of grey mist. Elizabeth cannot see her; she thought Jane could not see her either, but clearly she could. \u201cElizabeth, I think you are suffering from melancholy,\u201d Jane said.\n\nShe did not say, \u201cYou have a melancholic character.\u201d Elizabeth does not have a melancholic character. She did not have one before, at least.\n\nJane\u2019s voice makes \u2018melancholy\u2019 sound like an illness.\n\nMaybe it is.\n\n**\n\nElizabeth thinks about Jane\u2019s words, those words from three months ago, after breakfast, when she is back in her room. The room is grey. It is really not, of course. The colours of the walls were beautiful, Elizabeth seems to remember.\n\nShe wonders where all the colours have gone.\n\nMaybe she lost some of the colours when her father died. Elizabeth was left with Jane, her mother wailing, and two sisters she despised. (Lydia is gone.) No, no, the word \u2018despised\u2019 is correct. Elizabeth despises her sisters\u2014three of them at least\u2014because she can see their mother in them.\n\nBut Jane was still there, and Jane makes everything better.\n\nThen Jane gets married.\n\nTo a man she really does not love that much. But they are going to be thrown out of the house by their cousin, so, yes, Jane gets married.\n\nThe colours get a little dimmer.\n\nThen there is the incident. Elizabeth\u2019s reputation is ruined, et cetera, you know the story; she has to marry Mr Darcy.\n\nShe does not want to marry him. But she must.\n\nOn their wedding night, they fight. He says marrying her is a degradation. That she is beneath him, in every way. Elizabeth should fight back, she should answer, but she does not. She does not have it in her any longer. She just sits on the bed while he berates her. Finally, he stops.\n\nHe waits for her answer.\n\n\u201cVery true,\u201d she says.\n\nHe just stares at her. She does not look at him.\n\nThen they arrive at Pemberley. This huge, empty building, with nobody in it. Except her husband. And an army of servants.\n\nElizabeth despised her mother and her sisters. Now, her husband despises her.\n\nHow God must laugh.\n\n**\n\nIt is on that day, Elizabeth\u2019s first day at Pemberley, taking a stroll in the empty park, where she does not meet anybody, that she realises the colours are all gone.\n\n**\n\nIt has been ten months.\n\nThat day, after breakfast, Elizabeth visits the tenants. She talks to Mrs Reynolds. She does what she has to do.\n\nDinner. They eat, at the long, empty table. Elizabeth is very polite. She talks a little. She smiles. She does not know how to act otherwise. When he asks how she finds the soup, she says it is delicious and that they should thank the cook. She asks whether he has had a good day; her husband says it was a productive one. Elizabeth nods, and smiles, and says she is glad, and then her thoughts wander.\n\nTo nothing.\n\nWhen she returns, he is staring at her. He is worried.\n\nHe is very worried.\n\nIt does something to her, that look. It pierces the fog for the duration of one beat of a heart.\n\nThen it goes back to grey.\n\nBut still, at night, she wonders.\n\nShe remembers his look. It was a strange look. Worry, yes, but not only that. If she listened to her intuition, she would even think she saw something like despair.\n\nDespair is strong. Despair is\u2026not what Elizabeth expected. She lets her mind wander for a while, pondering. Then she decides she was wrong.\n\nTwo days pass.\n\nEverything is still grey.\n\n**\n\nElizabeth is breakfasting on Tuesday when her husband enters. He puts something near her plate.\n\nFlowers.\n\nThey are very red. Deep red. Red like blood, red like velvet, red like beautiful mysteries lurking behind theatre curtains. The red is so strong she almost gasps.\n\nShe raises her eyes to him. \u201cYou said you missed red,\u201d her husband explains. \u201cThose are from Lady Harden\u2019s hothouse. I rode there yesterday.\u201d\n\nShe does not say anything, just gazes at the flowers.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I thought you might prefer poppies. I think I heard you once say how much you liked poppies, but they are impossible to find in February,\u201d he explains. \u201cWell, maybe in London. I sent a letter. I shall have news, soon. Next week, I think.\u201d\n\nShe looks at him, her eyes sincere.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispers.\n\nHe does not say anything after that.\n\nThe footman goes to fetch a vase. Elizabeth drinks her coffee, eats her eggs, looking at the flowers the whole time.\n\n\u201cDo you want the flowers to be put in your room?\u201d her husband asks, after she has finished.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d she says, a little too quickly. Truth is, she hates her room. She cannot breathe in her room. She does not dislike the breakfast parlour. The parlour is nice, with high ceilings and large windows, opening\u2014on the grey out of doors, but opening nevertheless.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she repeats, smiling. \u201cI like it here. I think I am going to stay and read in here today.\u201d\n\nHe gives her a wan smile and observes her for a moment. Then he nods, and leaves.\n\n**\n\nShe wonders, for a fleeting moment, how he was before.\n\nHow he was before the death of his sister.\n\nBut mostly, she just looks at the flowers.\n\nThe world is grey, and red.\nThere are guests tonight, and Colonel Fitzwilliam is staying for a while. To be exact, he has stayed for a while, and leaves tomorrow.\n\nDinner goes well. Elizabeth is the perfect hostess; she behaves well. She shows education and taste.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell happened to your wife?\u201d asks Colonel Fitzwilliam, later, when the guests are gone, Elizabeth has retired for the night, and he is playing billiards with Darcy.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Darcy asks. (He knows very well what Fitzwilliam means.)\n\n\u201cShe used to be so lively, at Rosings.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you think her inadequate tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! For God\u2019s sake, Darcy, you know what I mean. It is like a candle has been snuffed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Darcy says slowly.\n\n(That is all he says.)\n\nThe game continues.\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam is not the type to give up easily.\n\n\u201cHave you quarrelled?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a forced marriage, Richard. On both sides.\u201d\n\nHis cousin is having none of it. \u201cCome on, Darcy, you liked her well enough at Rosings. I even thought\u2026 I even thought, for a moment there, you were going to propose.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I did not. And I ended up married to her regardless.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could have found a way out of it,\u201d Fitzwilliam says. \u201cCould have paid the family.\u201d\n\nDarcy does not answer. They keep playing.\n\nThen suddenly he cannot pretend any longer.\n\n\u201cLord, Richard,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI do not know what to do.\u201d\n\nHis cousin nods. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we quarrelled. On our wedding night. I shouted at her, and she just\u2026took it, Richard. I thought she would protest. Insult me back, even. She never seemed to lack spirit. But she just\u2026 She said I was right, and she just\u2026 She just took it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat she was beneath me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways the charmer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then\u2026 As you said. The fire is gone.\u201d Darcy looks somewhere undefined, on the other side of the window maybe, but there is nothing on the other side of the windows. Just the night.\n\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Fitzwilliam plays; he thinks. \u201cI have seen that, with soldiers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoldiers?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are shocked, by\u2026death, or a cannonball\u2026 Noise, blood, or the general merry horrors of war.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has not seen the merry horrors of war.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not saying it is the same thing, just that they are similar phenomenon. What I mean, is\u2026 You did not kill her spirit with one fight. Something else happened. Several things, I bet. People\u2026 They are well, and suddenly\u2014a series of events\u2014things that would not affect someone else\u2026\u201d\n\nDarcy thinks. About Elizabeth. Lydia\u2019s dishonouring the family, with that man\u2014that sergeant, from the North. Their father\u2019s death. The family thrown out of their own house. Jane\u2019s departure.\nElizabeth torn from her friends, sent\u2026here, with him.\n\n\u201cHow do you\u2026 Those soldiers, did they get better?\u201d\n\nFitzwilliam does not answer instantly. He plays.\n\n\u201cSome of them,\u201d he says, lightly. Too lightly. \u201cThere are doctors, in London, you know.\u201d\n\nThey talk about doctors for a while. Then they talk about other topics. Family. Money. Women (for Fitzwilliam).\n\nThen Fitzwilliam says, \u201cI know something that helps.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHelping.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not sure I follow.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelping others. That helps. Those soldiers, those who volunteered at hospitals, opened houses for the wounded, raised money\u2014those are the ones who got better. But it does not have to be that complicated. Even helping one person, it\u2014well\u2014helps.\u201d\n\nDarcy frowns. That hardly makes sense. And even if it did, whom is Elizabeth going to help? Nobody needs help round here. It is Pemberley. Everybody is well.\n\n\u201cSo, what about you?\u201d Fitzwilliam asks. \u201cAfter, you know, everything. After\u2026Georgie. How are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am well,\u201d Darcy answers.\nThe doctor comes. From London, very recommended, very expensive. Very sure of himself. When he comes, Darcy is not present. He should have been, but there has been some trouble with a mine, on another property.\n\nThe doctor listens to Elizabeth. They are alone, in the parlour, near her room. She tells him everything. She speaks about her night terrors, her fears. Then how those disappeared, suddenly. Leaving food with no taste, the view with no colours.\n\nWhen Darcy comes back the next day, something is very wrong.\n\nThe footman will not look at him. A maid does look at him\u2014with fear in her eyes\u2014and almost flees. Mrs Reynolds appears. She is livid.\n\n\u201cI have to talk to you now, sir. It is imperative\u2026 sir,\u201d she whispers. She seems almost afraid.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Darcy asks as soon as they are alone.\n\n\u201cSir, the doctor has come.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes? What did he say?\u201d\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d Mrs Reynolds explains, not meeting his eyes, \u201cMrs Darcy is locked in a tiny closet upstairs, on the third floor, screaming.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said\u2014the doctor said\u2014that Mrs Darcy was very ill. That she needed a shock, to \u2018restore\u2019 her brain, sir. He said that terror and hunger and\u2026I refused to obey him, but Jenkins\u2014Jenkins did not know what to do because you said to \u2018do all the doctor said\u2019, and the doctor imposed on him, I think, saying it was imperative, that you would be furious if there was disobedience and\u2026 But Mrs Darcy, she is not ill! She is not mad! She is a little melancholy sometimes, yes, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d\n\nWhen Darcy arrives on the third floor, yes, Elizabeth is screaming. He tries to open the closet, but the doctor has the key. He kicks the door down. Elizabeth throws herself into his arms, sobbing.\n\n\u201cOh, please, please, please, get me out of there. Oh, please I am begging you\u2026\u201d He is dragging her into the light, and she is clutching his shirt (it is a light blue shirt) and trying to breathe. She begs, \u201cDo not put me back in there. Oh God, do not put me back\u2026 I shall be happy. I swear I shall be happy, just do not put me back\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d he is whispering in her ear. \u201cNever.\u201d She is burying her face in his shirt (light blue shirt). \u201cI swear,\u201d he breathes. \u201cI swear to God. Never. That will never happen again.\u201d\n\nThe doctor is back the next day, with his assistants. He explains that Mrs Darcy should come with him, to his clinic, in London. Mrs Darcy is such a good case, a perfect case, he declares. He has a new method, with icy water and isolation and shocks\u2014physical and of the mind. Elizabeth is there listening, and Mrs Reynolds is there listening, and the footmen are there listening, and some of the maids have gathered in the hall, and Darcy throws the doctor and the assistants out, politely, paying them their dues, saying thank you so much, but we do not require your services any longer. He walks them to the door then shakes the doctor\u2019s hand, keeping a straight face all along, and tells him in a very low voice, that only the doctor can hear, that if he ever comes back, he is going to kill him, chop up his body, and feed it to the dogs.\n\nWhen Darcy comes up two hours later to see Elizabeth, she is herself again.\n\nBathed, dressed, her hair done.\n\nTense smile.\n\nPerfectly composed.\n\n\u201cMr Darcy,\u201d she says, \u201cI apologise for my behaviour. It seems I lost a part of my rationality up there.\u201d She smiles and adds, \u201cNever a good idea when you are trying to prove you are not crazy.\u201d\n\nDarcy is not composed.\n\n\u201cI am so sorry I was not at home to prevent this. That man\u2014that man is out of his mind. This will never happen again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you. That is very reassuring. But of course,\u201d Elizabeth continues, extremely politely, her smile just this side of terrified, \u201cthis is what a husband would say to reassure his wife, to calm her before the men arrive the next morning to take her to Bedlam.\u201d\n\nDarcy looks at her with dismay.\n\n\u201cIs that what you think is happening here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026do not know,\u201d says Elizabeth, in a light tone. \u201cIs it?\u201d Her smile disappears; she stands up and begins to pace the room. \u201cYou are trapped with a woman you do not esteem or want, Mr Darcy,\u201d she explains, her voice imperceptibly shaking, \u201cand now, you are told she is not completely well. Would not \u2018the clinic\u2019 be a perfectly clean, acceptable way to get rid of an undesirable partner? And if I protest, if I panic,\u201d she says, with an edge of, well, panic in her voice, \u201cit will be more proof that I am crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cElizabeth,\u201d he begins\u2026 And suddenly, all his wife\u2019s formality vanishes, only supplication and dread in her eyes, and he cannot think straight. \u201cDearest,\u201d he says, and she does not register it, she does not notice, for now. \u201cI do not want to get rid of you. On my parents\u2019 grave, on Georgiana\u2019s memory, I will not do it. That man\u2014those men\u2014will never come back, I swear\u2026\u201d\n\nShe is listening. Her eyes are focused on his shirt again. Light blue. The shirt is the first thing she saw when he pulled her out of that dark closet. The light blue is what she was clasping when he took her in his arms, repeating words of reassurance.\n\nShe nods. She thanks him. She spends the whole night awake, haunted by vivid, terrifying dreams\u2014no, by visions, worse than dreams, because dreams are unreal, and this is very real. People\u2014women\u2014undesirable wives or mistresses or fallen daughters are tortured in hell, yes, right now, labelled \u2018crazy\u2019, experimented upon, laughed at. Elizabeth has heard the stories, but they say\u2014they say the reality is worse.\n\nAt least those visions are in colour.\n\nThe doctor does not come back.\n\nAfter a while, she realises he never will.\n\nThe next day, and the next, and the next, she sees light blue everywhere. It is connected to him. To her husband. To his shirt. It is connected to \u2018dearest\u2019\u2014yes, she heard it, she just\u2014noticed later. What a word to use.\n\nLight blue is connected to her husband\u2019s embrace, to his smell. To the intense emotion in his eyes when she looked at him with such gratefulness, after he pulled her out.\n\nThe sofa in the summer drawing room is blue. And there is a vase, with red flowers, on the table.\n\nShe sits down.\n\nShe looks around.\n\nThe world is grey, and red, and light blue.\n\u201cYour alliance is a degradation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy family\u2019s expectations, the inferiority of your birth\u2026\u201d\n\nIt is not that she feels inferior. Or that she believes her alliance has been a degradation. She does not. She does not degrade herself, even in her own mind. No. It is the feeling that he does. That he is at her side, day after day, looking at her, feeling degraded.\n\nThat is where the grey comes from. Well, part of it.\n\n**\n\n\u201cI am sorry if I speak out of turn,\u201d Mrs Reynolds says.\n\nThey are in the autumn parlour. They are drinking tea and going through all the weekly, necessary decisions.\n\n\u201cI just want to say, Mrs Darcy, from me and the servants, that we\u2019re so happy you are\u2026 I mean, we were so worried, when that doctor was here.\u201d\n\nMrs Darcy pales. For a moment, Mrs Reynolds thinks that she is going to say something sincere, for once, something personal, something that is not amiable and polite and sensible and pleasant, but the moment passes, and Mrs Darcy is composed again.\n\n\u201cObviously, it was\u2026a scary moment,\u201d she answers, smiling. \u201cAnd not my finest, I fear, Mrs Reynolds.\u201d\n\n\u201cMadam, that man was out of his senses. And dangerous.\u201d\n\nMrs Darcy\u2019s smile becomes weaker.\n\n\u201cMrs Darcy,\u201d Mrs Reynolds continues, \u201ceverybody appreciates you a lot here. You are always kind, calm, and generous. We all hold you in the highest esteem.\u201d\n\nMrs Darcy seems stunned. Like this is a complete surprise to her.\n\nShe smiles, a weak one, but yes, a real one. Her eyes glint. Maybe tears.\n\n\u201cThank you, Mrs Reynolds,\u201d she whispers.\n\n**\n\nIt means a lot. Thinking she is in a house full of allies. Not full of enemies, who would bear witness against her and send her to icy water and shocks. To oblivion. But then, she remembers, oblivion is off the table. Thanks to her husband.\n\nShe sees it often, that scene. She plays it in her mind. She is in his arms. He is whispering in her ear. She is clutching the shirt. (The light blue shirt.) He is\u2026shivering with emotion, almost.\n\nA strange man\u2019s embrace\u2014no reason to affect her so.\n\nShe supposes it has been years since she touched another human being. No, not years. But long.\n\nHow long since he touched someone?\n\n**\n\nMrs Reynolds is still talking. Elizabeth has missed a part.\n\n\u201c\u2026 and he was not like that before,\u201d Mrs Reynolds says. Elizabeth raises her head. She listens. \u201cOh, he was never the most talkative of boys, but he smiled a lot. He was always so kind. And he laughed, when he was a young man\u2014with Mr Bingley and the colonel. They could be quite wild.\u201d\n\n\u201cWild?\u201d Elizabeth smiles\u2014another real one. \u201cMy husband was wild?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I mean, forgive me, Mrs Darcy, that was badly expressed,\u201d Mrs Reynolds says, amused. \u201cI mean, comparatively. But then, you know, his sister.\u201d\n\nElizabeth nods.\n\n\u201cWe all thought, this fog will lift when he gets married,\u201d Mrs Reynolds continues. \u201cAnd then you came, a pretty young bride\u2026 But clearly\u2026\u201d\n\n**\n\nElizabeth wonders all day.\n\nShe wonders when they are eating luncheon, she and her husband, mostly in silence (polite, not unpleasant silence). She wonders when he is gone, all afternoon. He is taking care of his duties; she is taking care of hers.\n\nDuties are like flies. They come, buzzing; Elizabeth swats them one by one. They are incessant. They are worthless. They make no sense.\n\nBut now the wondering is like a glue. Holding things together.\n\nMrs Reynolds said, \u201cfog.\u201d She said, \u201cWe all thought the fog would lift.\u201d\n\nElizabeth wonders.\n\nFog?\n\nWhat does the world of her husband look like?\n\nHer word is grey\u2014and red, and light blue. She looks at the red flowers in the vase. Her husband has an arrangement with Lady Harden\u2019s gardener now, and red flowers are brought regularly to Pemberley. They appear, like magic, in the rooms she walks into, like those fairy tales where flowers just blossom on the princess\u2019 steps, but of course she knows the process is much more complicated here. It is not magic, sadly. It is money.\n\nBut. But, there is thought. Behind the money. His thoughts.\n\nShe is writing letters, in the drawing room where she spends most of the time now, because the sofa is light blue. Light blue hums like a musical note.\n\nYes, what does the world of her husband look like? Is it foggy? Is it grey?\n\nDoes anything pierce the fog, ever?\n\nDinner. (She observes him. She is trying to guess the colours in his mind.)\n\nThere was despair in there, she remembers. (Black?)\n\nNight comes.\n\n**\n\nIt was a good day.\n\nFor a while, at the beginning, at Pemberley, when life was sinking into grey waters, she counted the bad days and the good days. The good days were when something good happened. Or something interesting. Or peculiar. Like a cup of good coffee. A visit where someone uttered a clever joke. Once, she woke early and saw the sun rise over the grounds, through her window, and it was magnificent. A silken drape of beauty thrown over the sky\u2014that morning, she had tears in her eyes too.\n\nBut soon it seemed grey was all there was, so she stopped counting.\n\nBut today, the wondering. About him. It kept everything else at bay.\n\n**\n\nThe next morning. Breakfast. Mostly in silence (polite, not unpleasant silence).\n\n**\n\nThe next morning. Breakfast. Mostly in silence (polite, not unpleasant silence).\n\nNothing is happening. The grey is winning again.\n\n**\n\nThe next morning. Breakfast. Mostly in silence (polite, not unpleasant silence).\n\n\u201cWould you like to take a walk with me?\u201d she asks. (After coffee.)\n\nHe says, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nShe did not think before asking. If she had, she would not have asked. He has his flies to swat.\n\nBut soon they are out of doors, and she has her hand on his arm.\n\n**\n\nShe forgets everything. She just walks, in the beautiful, cold light of the morning. Feeling his warmth near hers.\n\nThey go far. The lake (almost white, reflecting the sky).\n\nThe lime trees, black, nude. Witches\u2019 fingers. Writing dark letters in the air.\n\nThe hills. The sky.\n\nEverything white and silver.\n\nShe thinks about \u2018the inferiority of your birth\u2019 and \u2018the degradation\u2019 again, but not in a bad way.\n\nSilver threads are connecting her to her husband, she realises. One of the silver threads is the shared memory of that night, of what he said. It is always there, this thread, whatever happens. It does not matter the number of breakfasts they take together, the insults stay there, their shared knowledge of them connecting them.\n\nBut there are other threads.\n\nOne silver thread is flowers appearing wherever she goes.\n\nOne silver thread is her hand clutching that shirt (while he is shivering).\n\nOne silver thread is that she is wondering about him.\n\nOne silver thread is all those breakfasts together (after all).\n\nOne fragile, glimmering silver thread is that he said \u2018dearest\u2019.\n\n(What a word to say.)\n\nThe sky is huge. And endless. And silver.\n\u201cWhen I came back into Hertfordshire,\u201d Darcy says, on one of their walks. \u201cWhen I came back into Hertfordshire, the second time. I\u2026\u201d\n\nHe stops. She waits.\n\nCrocuses are appearing in the fields around, piercing the frost. They are very yellow.\n\nThe rest of the sentence does not come. Elizabeth tries to guess. The problem is\u2014she does not want to think about that time. Her childhood, yes. Her youth, yes. After the death of her father\u2026no. It is all hidden in a fog regardless.\n\nAround them, crocuses everywhere. Bright, violent yellow.\n\nEgyptians revered them as a symbol of the return of the sun. (Her father explained it to her.)\n\nSilence. Walking. Silver air, silver cold. Stunning winter dawn.\n\nHe changes the subject.\n\n\u201cThat night, Elizabeth. Our wedding night. I\u2026\u201d\n\nHe hesitates, and she says, quickly, \u201cI am not particularly keen to revisit the subject, sir.\u201d\n\nHe does not say anything after that.\n\n**\n\nCrocuses are beautiful but leave her with a taste of dread.\n\n**\n\nNot that subject. It would destroy everything.\n\nHe would apologise politely, coldly. Not really meaning it. Maybe he would speak a little more about how unsuitable she is (in a polite, reasonable way).\n\nIt would destroy everything, rip off all the delicate silver threads. Rip off \u2018dearest\u2019, and the blue shirt, and the tender smell of his skin.\n\nNo.\n\n**\n\nOf course, the unfinished conversation is a new thread connecting them.\n\nA yellow one. Like the crocuses.\n\n**\n\nThe day passes. It is not a pleasant one.\n\nThe yellow thread is pulsating. The other beautiful secret bonds (all delicacy and grace) are shattering\u2014no, not shattering. Vanishing. No. Dimming. Disappearing from view like faraway stars erased by the glare of a blazing sun.\n\n**\n\nElizabeth wants to retreat into the grey. Grey is safe.\n\nShe cannot.\n\nIn the grey she can rest.\n\nShe is restless.\n\n**\n\nOf course, their chambers are connected. She has her bedchamber (a grey one), her parlour (charcoal), and her dressing room (no particular colour). He has the same, she supposes. The two main rooms are connected by a door. Always closed, of course. She locked it after their wedding night, she supposes. She does not even remember doing it.\n\nThey both hear noise through the door, sometimes. Often. Steps. The floorboards creaking. The muffled sound of voices\u2014his conversation with his valet, her conversation with her maid. (Those are rare. The maid is hard grey.)\n\n**\n\nIt is night. Her maid is gone. She hesitates. On the other side of the door. Her chamber is grey, of course, as is the air, as is her future slumber.\n\nShe knocks lightly. She opens the door. She enters.\n\n**\n\nIt is all golden and brown on the other side.\n\nThe fire is still burning, candles are lit, and the valet is folding garments. Her husband is sorting books on an oak sideboard. They both turn to look at her.\n\nMahogany tables, brown (maybe dark green) walls, golden light. A lot of books, scattered. Leather bindings, brown or dark red. Maroon drapes. The fire.\n\nShe wonders whether it is what the inside of her husband\u2019s soul looks like.\n\nShe is not moving. \u201cJames, can you leave us?\u201d her husband says, in a casual, polite voice.\n\nThe valet vanishes.\n\n**\n\n\u201cHow are you tonight, Elizabeth?\u201d her husband says. \u201cDo you want me to ring for some tea?\u201d (In a casual, polite voice. Like his wife in his bedroom is an everyday occurrence.)\n\n\u201cTea would be lovely, thank you,\u201d she says, smiling, and then she enters the room for real. (In a casual and polite way. Nobody will say that Elizabeth Bennet\u2014Elizabeth Darcy\u2014is not always perfectly polite.)\n\nI wanted to say how much I enjoy our walks together, Mr Darcy. And I do hope that the slight unpleasantness of this morning will not prevent us from walking together again, is what she came here to say. With a light smile, to pretend the topic is less serious than it really is.\n\nBut now the words will not come out.\n\n\u201cThis is a beautiful room,\u201d she says instead.\n\n\u201cI think so too,\u201d her husband answers. He is in his shirtsleeves, not completely undressed yet. \u201cIt was my father\u2019s.\u201d\n\nElizabeth looks at the books. Memorises the titles. She looks at the mahogany table.\n\nHe looks at her.\n\nHer hair prepared for bed. Under the dark-grey dressing gown, a sophisticated silk shift and a bed jacket. Off-white, both. Off-white feels intimate.\n\nIt feels true.\n\nIt fills him with despair.\n\nShe looks at the other table. Where the valet left the garments. \u201cOh, this is the light blue shirt,\u201d she says. Lightly.\n\nEvery artificial sentence of small talk she utters pains him a little more.\n\nHe feels like ending it all. No, he does not. A gentleman never would. A Christian never would. But he understands why people do it. When everything is meaningless, a shallow and cruel image of what it is supposed to be. When the fire is so near, it would warm you up, but you raise your hand to it, and the wind freezes your heart.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d she says, \u201cI have this silly idea\u2026\u201d She turns to him. She smiles. She walks to him.\n\nHe pays attention. Her tone is light again, breezy, but a little too breezy. Like she is going to say something important. \u201cI have a\u2026liking for\u2026 I notice\u2026colours,\u201d she explains.\n\nHe nods. \u201cI know you like red.\u201d\n\nNow she is near him.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Facing him. Very near. \u201cAnd also,\u201d she says, \u201cI like your blue shirt. Because you were wearing it when you freed me from that closet.\u201d She raises her hand.\n\nNo icy wind blows.\n\n\u201cWhen you opened the door, and I\u2026\u201d\n\nShe puts her hand on his chest.\n\nHe stops breathing.\n\nShe stops breathing.\nDarcy\u2019s world is made of concentric circles.\n\nIt is dark, mostly. Night. In his mind, the circles look like Celtic ruins, made of crude grey stones, on a grassy plain, dimly lit by the moon. It looks like Scotland, that he visited, with his parents, when he was very young. Scotland at night.\n\nThe first circle represents him. Ghosts live there. She does too.\n\nThe ghosts are his parents and Georgiana. She is Elizabeth, of course. She is a being of pale fire. Her hair is undone; she is wearing only a thin linen shift. It is a strange image, considering he has never seen her in such a state of undress. But that is how she was in his dreams, when he fell for her, at Netherfield\u2014yes, it happened in Netherfield; afterwards, he just fell deeper.\n\nThe second circle. It is larger. There reside people he is responsible for. People living at Pemberley\u2014on the estate, or connected to it. Bingley belongs there too, as does Colonel Fitzwilliam\u2014Darcy is not responsible for Colonel Fitzwilliam, but his cousin sleeps there regardless. Circles are not always logical.\n\nIn the third circle lives his family. Darcy\u2019s cousins, uncles. Aunts. His duty is to respect them, to help them, to visit them. If something goes wrong, he must make it right. If he cannot, then the fault is his.\n\nIn the fourth circle moves a strange crowd, of people he is connected to somehow. He is not responsible for them, but he owes them courtesy, politeness. Efficient men with a profession\u2014lawyers, merchants, barristers, who do good work for the family. Friends of his parents. Friends of his friends. To all those people, he must be loyal. He would not refuse his help if they ever asked.\n\nIn the fifth circle there is society. Society includes the third and fourth circles, but it is also an entity of its own\u2014an abstract crowd of people and judgments and obligations. Society\u2019s opinion should be respected, of course.\n\nThen, there is the rest of the world. It is endless. When he was young, he was curious. Scotland was so fascinating. Now, curiosity has died.\n\nThe rest is already so heavy to bear.\n\n**\n\nBut back to her.\n\nElizabeth was fire. (She is white fire still.) But she was blazing, burning, when he met her\u2014he was already walking in the shadows, three ghosts as his daily companions. And she, fiery with life and light and laughter. He did not have the right to take her, of course. He could not buy her and bring her home, because of the third, fourth, and fifth circles.\n\nElizabeth would have been good for the second circle, though, Darcy was thinking, at the time, at Netherfield and at Rosings, when he was watching her and listening to her with quiet desperation. She would have been perfect. A good friend to his close friends. A good mistress of Pemberley\u2014she would have helped him carry the load\u2014and of course, in the first circle, in his arms, she would have\u2026 She\u2026 The sun would have risen.\n\nBut no. It would have been selfish. Marrying just to please himself\u2014what an idea! For love? How self-centred. Egotistical. No.\n\nThen he got her, despite everything. When he realised what he had done to her, after their wedding night, the third, fourth, and fifth circles disappeared from his view. Society is still there somewhere, of course, moving like a big, ever-hissing snake. But he cannot see it any longer\u2014the night is absolute on that part of the plain.\n\nThat night, after he berated her. When she sat down on the bed, raised her eyes to him, and said, \u201cVery true,\u201d to all his insults. Brutally, he could not remember. Why the judgments and the opinions of those circles had even mattered. Why he had even listened, even for a second, to the hiss of the snake. All his fears of misalliance and gossip crumbled, reduced to nothingness and rubbish\u2014\n\u2014when he realised he had destroyed all his hopes of ever seeing the dawn.\n\n**\n\nHow God must laugh.\n\n**\n\nSo, yes, he is very unhappy.\n\nIt is well. He deserves to be\n\n(Georgiana\u2019s ghost is sitting by him, with a shy smile.)\n\n**\n\nAnd then Elizabeth puts her hand on his chest.\n\nAnd it is real.\n\nAnd it is true.\n\nAnd it is burning like hell.\n\n**\n\nElizabeth\u2019s hand lingers for a few moments. Then she smiles and walks away. She says something about tea. The door opens, tea is served, they drink, they talk, politely, then she goes away, to sleep.\n\n**\n\nIt is morning. The breakfast parlour. She arrives, she sees him, and smiles.\n\nHe smiles back.\n\nThey go walking. (Crocuses everywhere.)\n\nHe is very happy.\n\nNo, it is not happiness. It is a sort of fever.\n\nHe is burning.\n\n**\n\nWaiting for her next smile. Her next touch.\n\nHe does his tasks for the day. They are not flies. He does not swat them. Everything is connected and makes sense. It is just that there are a lot of them, and they are heavy.\n\nIn the evening, when he goes home, Elizabeth smiles at him again.\n\n**\n\nIn the morning, they walk.\n\nThey mostly stay silent. But sometimes he points and explains. The history of that chapel. Of the village. Of that farm. Of that man. There is a tree, and a bench. They sit there. Across the lane is a beautiful old stone cross, half buried, with a broken Virgin Mary. A remnant of more Catholic times. Faraway, the old abbey\u2014in ruins. He tells the story.\n\nBefore their walks, they (the bench, the cross, the farm, the man, the abbey) were hazy. Now, when Elizabeth sees them without her husband, they vibrate with the sound of his voice, with the feel of his presence, with the knowledge imparted.\n\nThey glow. They are secret and special.\n\n**\n\nOne day her husband touches her.\n\nHe has forgotten his gloves, and when he realises it, they are already far under the white and silver sky. It is not that cold. They go on. She has her arm in his, so his hand, his bare hand, reposes on her wrist. It does not have to, really, but somehow, it is.\n\nThere is a naked part between her coat and her gloves. His fingers trail on her skin.\n\nIt is barely a touch at first.\n\nShe does not say anything. She does not pull away.\n\nThey keep walking. In perfect silence.\n\nHis fingers touch her skin again.\n\nThey keep walking.\n\nHe does not say a word.\n**\n\nNext morning, she enters the breakfast parlour, and smiles. He smiles back\u2014then he is serious\u2014his eyes follow her, when she sits, when she fills her plate, when she pours coffee. His gaze is intense. In that way he has, in that way he always had, Elizabeth suddenly realises. Even when they were not married. When they were just acquaintances.\n\n\u201cWould you like some more coffee, Mr Darcy?\u201d she asks. (Nobody could say that Elizabeth Bennet\u2014Darcy\u2014is not always perfectly polite.)\n\n\u201cI was thinking,\u201d he answers. \u201cYou said you like colours.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis winter is endless,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd very grey.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is getting better,\u201d she says, raising her eyes to him.\n\nShe thinks he stops breathing there for a while. But maybe it is her imagination. Maybe it is all in her imagination. The wrist, the glows. The shirt. \u2018Dearest\u2019. Maybe she is grasping at straws. Worse. Maybe there are no straws.\n\nIt is a while before he speaks again. \u201cWell, I was thinking,\u201d he finally continues. \u201cAbout colours. It is still the Season.\u201d\n\nHe hesitates. Then, \u201cHow about going to London for a few weeks?\u201d\nLondon is brittle and beautiful and dangerous. Cutting like a crystal shard.\n\nJulia Fitzwilliam. Darcy\u2019s cousin. Twenty-eight, fashionable, funny, married to the Fitzwilliam heir. Taking Elizabeth shopping.\n\nNoise, busy streets, yelling, strange smells, carriages, expensive teas in expensive establishments. Gorgeous fabrics. Deep, shimmering hues. A new maid, sent by Julia. New dresses, new gloves, new shoes, new shawls, new words. London words. Silks. Satins.\n\nNo time to think. Elegant ladies with pearls being introduced to you on the pavement.\n\nJulia is perfect because she is new. She does not know about Elizabeth. About the melancholy, about the grey, about the doctor and the screaming in the closet. Julia does not know about the Elizabeth of before (in Hertfordshire), she does not know about the Elizabeth of after (at Pemberley), she just knows about the Elizabeth of now.\n\nSo, Elizabeth of now can try a new skin. (Julia will not know it is new.) The new skin is joyful, witty, sophisticated. Almost like the Elizabeth from Hertfordshire, but that Elizabeth (from before) was not a skin. \nThat Elizabeth was real.\n\n**\n\nElizabeth does not see Darcy much during the day. He has a lot of business in the city. And she has Julia.\n\nBut at night\u2026\n\nThey are always out, together. She and her husband. Theatre, dinner, dinner, ball, theatre, concert, dinner, repeat.\n\nElizabeth is drinking life. Sucking it, like a vampire sucks blood.\n\nSee, Elizabeth does not feed on loneliness. She feeds on people. Like\u2026like her mother, really. (Dreadful thought.) Elizabeth feeds on conversation and laughs, friendships and crowds, connections and humans. \nOn parties and ideas and irony. Her husband, she suspects, feeds on loneliness. Well, maybe on solitude. Nobody really feeds on loneliness.\n\nHe is right about London colours\u2014she drinks them too. She is sucking them hungrily. Colours in actors\u2019 costumes, garish wallpapers glowing in the candlelight, the infinite gay nuances of the masquerade\u2019s crowd. Colours are intellectual too; Elizabeth finds them in phrases of music, in poetry readings, in political debates, in literary discussions\u2014in colourful insults overheard through a window.\n\n(Hearing them, treasuring them, storing them for grey days to come.)\n\nIt is raining a lot. Elizabeth likes it. London is hazy, like a modern painting.\n\nSo yes, together, she and Darcy, every night. For hours, from seven till midnight, often later.\n\nHe never touches her\u2014except when she is taking his arm, of course. Other husbands, they touch their wives on the elbow, the arm, the shoulder, the waist. Her husband almost does it, once\u2014when they enter their theatre box\u2014his hand moves towards the small of her back. He hesitates\u2014the hand moves away.\n\nElizabeth has a red dress. Crimson. He bought the fabric for her. (\u201cI thought you might like this,\u201d he says. She does.)\n\nHe does not touch her the evening she is wearing the dress. But she feels like she is wearing him. Like he is touching her all over. (Unnerving thought.)\n\nShe sees Julia a lot. They laugh a lot. Elizabeth tells her about the doctor.\n\nIt is still raining. The grey in the streets glimmers. They have tea. She and Julia. Again.\n\nElizabeth\u2019s new skin (joyful, witty, sophisticated) is far from perfect. There are dinners where Elizabeth feels fragile, lost. She falters. She says something\u2014that does not fit exactly. That is just a little to the left, or to the right, like a missed throw at cricket.\n\n\u201cI apologise,\u201d she says to Darcy, in the carriage, afterwards. \u201cI lack practice. I fear I played a few fake notes in the conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not think anybody notices.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is because I knew you before\u2014I can see the difference. But even with\u2026\u201d He pauses. (Even with what? Elizabeth wonders.) \u201cEven now,\u201d he continues, \u201cyou are more charming and clever than any woman present.\u201d\n\nShe is speechless.\n\n**\n\nThe Matlock dinner.\n\nDarcy\u2019s family. Who elegantly, sharply disapprove of her. Not of her, exactly\u2014her they could not care less about. No, they disapprove of the \u2018circumstances\u2019. The incident, the damage, the marriage. All of them do, except Colonel Fitzwilliam; but Colonel Fitzwilliam is getting slaughtered at Waterloo. So, they feel free to slaughter her.\n\n(Julia is present, but she does not intervene.)\n\nIt is done with needles.\n\nLong, thin, metallic needles (sentences) piercing Elizabeth just where it hurts.\n\nElizabeth of old would have laughed. Elizabeth of old would have parried the needles with ease. This Elizabeth feels naked.\n\nShe parries, though. She smiles. She makes neutral, amiable answers. (Nobody could say that Elizabeth Bennet\u2014Darcy\u2014is not absolutely\u2026you know.)\n\nBut she gets paler and paler.\n\nSuddenly, her husband\u2019s hand is on her shoulder.\n\nShe does not see him coming. But yes, suddenly, he is at her side, in the drawing room, touching her.\n\nDinner. Darcy puts his hand on her arm often. On her elbow. Or even, once, on her shoulder, around the chair. (A bold move.) He talks. He is very calm. He catches most of the needles in the air and lays them serenely on the table, near Elizabeth\u2019s plate.\n\nAs a gift.\n\nBut he cannot catch them all. At the end of the meal, Elizabeth is getting tired of catching. She is beginning to miss some. Darcy\u2019s hand is warm though.\n\n\u201cSadly, Mrs Darcy, a life in the country\u2014with such a family\u2014may not have prepared you for all the pressures of London,\u201d Lady Matlock says.\n\n\u201cYou are very right, Lady Matlock, it did not,\u201d Elizabeth answers. \u201cBut my father always said that navigating the daily absurdities of a small town would teach me to survive in any society.\u201d\n\nJulia smiles. \u201cOf course, you needed a doctor to survive Pemberley\u2019s society, Elizabeth. So I wonder whether your father was right, and whether you will really be able to navigate this one.\u201d\n\nPeople laugh. Elizabeth sits petrified. No words come.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Julia adds. \u201cAnd here we all thought you had an answer for everything.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks of shopping and tea and \u2018intimate\u2019 conversations. And now, wielding the blade, waiting for Elizabeth to be weary, and\u2026strike.\n\nThen, at the end. Near the drawing room door. \u201cShall I come tomorrow to fetch you, Elizabeth?\u201d Julia asks. \u201cWe still have to go to that fitting\u2014the green silk. It will go perfectly with your complexion.\u201d\n\nElizabeth cannot insult Darcy\u2019s cousin. To be honest, she does not feel strong enough. \u201cI am so sorry, your ladyship,\u201d she whispers. \u201cI am not sure I shall have time tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Julia protests. \u201cIs it \u2018your ladyship\u2019 now? I am sure\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat my wife is too polite to tell you, your ladyship,\u201d Darcy interrupts, \u201cis that you are not welcome in our house any longer.\u201d\n\nEverybody hears.\n\n**\n\nThe carriage. The night.\n\nIt is still raining.\n\nThe carriage gets stuck in the street.\n\nThe water has risen somewhere, near the river. Some streets are impassable. They are stuck. They are sitting side by side, shoulders touching, under the blanket.\n\nElizabeth should say thank you. She cannot say thank you.\n\nWait. Why can she not?\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she breathes.\n\nHe looks at her. She cannot really see him in the dark. She imagines the look. So many possibilities.\n\nSilence. Then she says, \u201cYou never told me how your sister died, Mr Darcy. It seems\u2026 Is there\u2026something\u2026I do not know about?\u201d\n\nIt is a hunch. Things she overheard in the Matlock drawing room. The ladies\u2019 faces when they pronounced the name \u201cGeorgiana,\u201d or rather, when they did not.\n\n(It is a hunch, but Elizabeth knows she is right.)\n\nNew silence.\n\n\u201cThere was a man\u2026\u201d Darcy starts.\n\n\u201cOh my God.\u201d Elizabeth shivers.\n\n(Georgiana was fifteen.)\n\n\u201cHe was the son of my father\u2019s steward,\u201d Darcy explains. \u201cHe was raised with us\u2014Georgiana trusted him. He seduced her.\u201d Elizabeth is silent. \u201cThey spent a few nights in different inns together, then the carriage had an accident on the road to Scotland. They both died.\u201d\n\nElizabeth cannot speak.\n\n**\n\nShe should take his hand, she thinks. She cannot.\n\nWait. Why can she not?\n\nShe cannot.\n\n**\n\nMen are talking near the carriage. Coarse voices. Street conversations. Darcy listens. He asks the footman to open the door, he gets out. He speaks with the men. Elizabeth cannot hear.\n\nIt is still raining.\n\nWhen Darcy comes back, he says, \u201cThere have been storms in the North. I am worried.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Pemberley?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I think we should go back.\u201d\n\nThe rain is falling harder.\nThey find an express at the house. Pemberley has been flooded; the situation is dire. Darcy leaves on horseback the next morning; Elizabeth will join him with the carriage.\n\n\u201cI apologise. I thought your London stay would be more pleasant,\u201d he says, when he is at the door.\n\n\u201cMy stay in town was very pleasant,\u201d Elizabeth answers. \u201cI enjoyed it immensely.\u201d\n\nHe stares at her, trying to divine her thoughts, her emotions. Trying to interpret her smile.\n\nTrying to guess whether there is\u2026more.\n\n\u201cI am talking, of course, about yesterday\u2019s dinner,\u201d he adds, with a smile of his own. (Apologetic. A little shy.) \u201cMy family\u2019s behaviour, and Julia\u2019s, was unpardonable.\u201d\n\nElizabeth shakes her head. \u201cIt is of no importance. None whatsoever.\u201d Then she hesitates, and it is her turn to look shy. \u201cI mean\u2014I understand their judgment is of great importance to you, and\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he interrupts. \u201cNo. It is not.\u201d\n\nIt is in direct contradiction with what he told her on their wedding night. They look at each other; there is so much more to say, but Pemberley is waiting.\n\n(It is a lie. The truth is, he is terrified.)\n\n\u201cI hope we shall come back to town sometimes,\u201d Elizabeth says softly.\n\n\u201cWe shall.\u201d\n\nThey are still looking at each other.\n\nDarcy does not know how to say good-bye. (He does not want to.)\n\nSo many things to tell her.\n\nThey say good-bye. He leaves.\n\n**\n\nFour days later, in the morning, Elizabeth\u2019s carriage arrives at Pemberley. Near Pemberley. Because she has to travel the last mile on foot.\n\nThree villages flooded, and the main house. The water has receded now, and Elizabeth can enter the\u2026her\u2026 She can come home. She is aghast at the damage.\n\nIt gets worse. After the first flood, a dam broke uphill, she learns, creating a second disaster. Now Lambton is underwater, and another village, and\u2026\n\nNo time for grey. No time for self-reflection or melancholy. Darcy is in Lambton. She does not see him. Elizabeth\u2019s duties are food and shelter, for more than two hundred people. Women and children.\n\nPeople everywhere in Pemberley House. On Pemberley\u2019s ground floor, the part that has not been flooded. Half of Pemberley\u2019s first floor.\n\nFires and warm soup and running around with Mrs Reynolds and the servants. It is like they are allies in a war, she and Mrs Reynolds, giving orders, making hard decisions. Thinking in essentials. One woman has seen her three children drown before her eyes. News come from Lambton, and it is bad, and it is night. Darcy does not come back. Then it is morning and people are coughing. Elizabeth thinks of pneumonia, of children dying.\n\n\u201cThey ingested unhealthy water,\u201d the reverend explains. \u201cMiasma.\u201d Fires, blankets, hot tea, hot remedies. One baby has a high fever. He is near death. He vomits. The Elizabeth that once looked for colours in the snow seems to be a thousand years away.\n\nIf she ever existed.\n\nIt is raining again.\n\nThe men are still in Lambton and the other village, trying to save what they are able. They need food. Elizabeth and three kitchen maids (and mules and a cart) go there, taking everything they can.\n\nElizabeth has not seen Darcy since he left the house, in London.\n\nIn Lambton it is water and mud and dead bodies. (Lying in the mud.) \u2018Only\u2019 a dozen. (It could have been so much worse, everyone says.) The activity is dwindling down. It is over, mostly. People who could be saved are safe, the others are dead. The water will recede.\n\n(If it ever stops raining.)\n\nDarcy is nowhere in sight.\n\nShe looks for him.\n\nHe is that way, someone says. No\u2014he left to inspect Brooks\u2019s house, someone else explains. Someone talks about the church cellar. Then apparently, he is helping to empty the Andersons\u2019 barn.\n\nExcept he is nowhere.\n\nThe sun is going down. Elizabeth panics.\n\nShe walks north, following the water. Someone said Darcy left that way, an hour ago.\n\nShe walks.\n\n**\n\nThe noise and voices of the village fade. She keeps walking, calling him.\n\nNothing. No one.\n\n**\n\nOnly water and flooded houses and darkening skies. The world is brown and silver. A universe in dual tones. The sky is an endless mirror.\nEmptiness and death. She keeps walking. She goes farther and farther, the only spark of life in a perfectly still world. In fact, she has never felt so alive. In the worst way possible: pain, exhaustion, fear. Searing fear.\n\nShe keeps calling him.\n\nThe rain falls harder.\n\n\u201cHere!\u201d Darcy\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere!\u201d he repeats. \u201cHurry! The boy is trapped!\u201d\n\nThe house. The flooded house, in the middle of the river\u2014there was a whole hamlet there, now Atlantis. She enters the freezing river\u2014feet, calves, knees. It is getting dark. There is a wall, and the door is open, but it is flooded to the lintel. It is the only way in. Grey, mud, cold. She cannot swim.\n\n\u201cHurry!\u201d he says. \u201cI am not going to be able to hold him when\u2026\u201d\n\nShe dives under.\nShe is in.\n\nCold. Dark. A very small room. Very low ceiling. Dwindling light, through the broken window. Water gets to Elizabeth\u2019s chest.\n\nThe head of the little boy is hardly visible; Darcy is deep in the water, holding him.\n\n\u201cHis foot is stuck in\u2026\u201d Darcy starts. Elizabeth tries to look. \u201cNo,\u201d Darcy whispers, \u201chold his head, let me.\u201d\n\nShe holds the child. She is so cold. She talks to him, trying to reassure him. Darcy dives into the grey, muddy water, once, twice. \u201cI cannot see anything,\u201d he grumbles, and suddenly\u2014something must have happened, somewhere, maybe uphill\u2014maybe another dam has broken, because of the rain\u2014there is a wave, water bubbling by the entrance. Darcy has dived again. The child gasps; he is free. Darcy reappears.\n\n\u201cThe water is rising!\u201d Elizabeth cries, in case Darcy is too dazed to notice.\n\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Darcy mumbles, then, \u201cGo!\u201d he orders. The boy dives down in the direction of the door and disappears. They hear him yelling something outside; he sounds safe. Darcy turns to Elizabeth\u2014but it is already too late.\n\nThe current is too strong. They see it by the window. The river has grown huge. The water is rising fast. Soon it will touch the ceiling.\n\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Darcy repeats. Elizabeth\u2019s feet hardly reach the bottom. She is shaking from the cold. He takes her in his arms. They stand immobile for a moment, heads very close. Even her thoughts are frozen.\n\n\u201cElizabeth,\u201d he begins. Then, \u201cWait.\u201d\n\nHe disappears underwater.\n\nShe stays alone.\n\nHe reappears.\n\n\u201cDo you know how to swim?\u201d\n\nShe shakes her head. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a passage down there, leading to the wine cellar. You have to dive down and then up. I shall help you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I cannot do it. You should go. You will come back later,\u201d she lies. \u201cWith help.\u201d\n\n\u201cDown, and up. I shall hold your hand,\u201d he repeats. \u201cNow.\u201d\n\nUnderwater they go. It is not difficult. Now they are in another room, looking exactly like the one they just left. Stone walls, low ceiling, the water is even higher.\n\n\u201cWe shall have to do it again,\u201d Darcy explains. \u201cThe wine cellar is connected to another, and then I think we can reach the Jones\u2019s farm. It is on higher ground.\u201d\n\nShe cannot protest any longer. She follows him. Then they must do it a third time, going through a completely flooded room, no air at all.\n\nUnderwater. For an eternity. Oblivion. She is moving through living darkness.\n\nThe underworld. Liquid.\n\nThey come out in what was a courtyard and is now a lake. She can breathe again. The world is real again. They move forwards, holding on to the walls. They get into the (flooded) farm.\n\nThe water is still rising. It is almost night.\n\nDarcy disappears for the second time.\n\n\u201cTo the east,\u201d he says when he comes back. They make progress, along the walls, going east. He is right, the ground is rising. When they arrive in the other part of the farm, Elizabeth\u2019s feet touch the ground.\n\nIt lasts for another eternity\u2014following him, going from house to house. Soon they can walk, waist high in the cold water, and suddenly they are on dry land (not dry, very muddy) on an island (not an island, a hill, now surrounded by water). There is a house. They run. Well, she tries. In truth, she can hardly walk. Her dress is so soaked, she is carrying lead.\n\nThen Darcy breaks something\u2014a wood shutter maybe. They get inside.\n\n**\n\nA drawing room, lost in shadows. Maybe a rich farm, or some nice cottage, deserted. The air is humid. Darcy fumbles in the shadows, looking for the tinderbox.\n\n\u201cGet out of your clothes,\u201d he orders.\n\nShe does not demur. It is life or death. Except, she needs him, because she cannot remove her dress alone. He helps her, then he starts the fire. Soon, she is down to her (soaked) shift; she looks around, climbs on a table, she reaches the curtain, and pulls it with all her might. It comes crashing down.\n\nThe flames are getting higher.\n\n\u201cI shall help you,\u201d she says in return. Men\u2019s clothes are so tight. She helps him out of his boots, out of his breeches.\n\nHe is totally naked. He hangs his clothes and hers to dry.\n\nThe fire is burning brighter, but she is still shaking. She grabs the curtain. \u201cWe should try to keep warm,\u201d she says.\n\nHe nods. He gestures at her shift. \u201cYou should take that off.\u201d\n\nShe does. He hangs it to dry also. He takes her in his arms. They wrap the curtain around them.\n\nThey sit down near the hearth.\n\n**\n\nAt first, she does not think.\n\nExhaustion does not even begin to describe it. Cold does not even begin to describe it. She is not even really conscious.\n\n**\n\nSlowly, it gets better.\n\n**\n\nHer thoughts were frozen too. They begin to wake up.\n\nShe is naked, in the arms of a naked man. She should be horrified. She is not.\n\nIt is not important.\n\nWhat is important is they are both alive.\n\nGetting warmer.\n\n**\n\nTime passes. One hour, maybe two.\n\nHer eyes are closed, but she can see them from afar, like she is a bird. The two of them, near the fire, both naked. She imagines the light of the flames dancing on their skin (in truth, they are huddled under the curtain, but that is how she sees them). She pictures the yellow and orange lights, the infinite nuances of their flesh, the shimmering of the velvet curtain.\n\nThen (in her mind) they are not in a drawing room any longer, but in a cave, deep down in the earth. They are near the fire\u2014another fire. Strange paintings on the wall\u2014bronze and ochre and coral.\n\n**\n\nTime passes.\n\n**\n\nHe is in the first circle, and she is in his arms.\n\nHe feels the grass under their feet, the crude grey stones around. The night and the Scottish stars. It is raining, softly, but they are somehow protected. Or maybe it is raining for real, out of doors.\n\nThe other circles do not even exist. They are alone, on the top of the hill, under the white moon.\n\n**\n\nNow she begins to feel conscious of him.\n\nHis legs against hers. Her back against his chest. His head touching hers. His stubble, caressing her cheek.\n\nHis heart beating.\n\n**\n\nHe feels her skin under his fingers. Her breast, above his wrist. The softness of her belly. He imagines the whiteness of her thigh.\n\nHe feels her breathing.\n\n**\n\nTheir right hands are so close to each other.\n\nElizabeth takes his.\n\nTheir fingers intertwine, and his whole body tenses. Then he kisses her neck, her right shoulder; he is feverish, desperate. Her cheek, her temple. She leans into him. He moves a little. She turns to her left; she nuzzles her head into his shoulder. (He is kissing her head, her brow, her face.)\n\nShe falls asleep.\nThe sun is rising.\n\nWarmth, light. Elizabeth wakes up.\n\nShe rises slowly\u2014she is alone. Her clothes are dry. She dresses.\n\nEverything is slow and beautiful.\n\nThe rays of light, through the broken shutters. The water outside. So peaceful.\n\nShe hears her husband in another room (the kitchen, she guesses). She does not want to go and see him yet. She does not know what will happen, and she wants to hold on to beauty for a while. She wants to hold on to the previous night, to the fire, to the curtain, her dreams, and the cave. To his touch and his embrace. To what happened before she drifted off to sleep.\n\nThe moments\u2014the memories\u2014are floating in a bubble. It is fragile (and silver).\n\nElizabeth sits on the sofa. She closes her eyes. She imagines the room, the subdued colours around her. The shimmer of the bubble floating in the air. Fairies are stuck in it.\n\nShe wants the present to last forever.\n\n**\n\nShe goes to the kitchen. Darcy is trying to toast some stale bread. It smells like coffee and bacon.\n\n\u201cOh, God bless you,\u201d she says, laughing.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he answers. There is light in his eyes when he looks at her. \u201cI do not remember being so hungry in my entire life.\u201d\n\n(She is ravenous.)\n\nShe helps him prepare breakfast; she finds preserves in a cupboard. They go back. There is a dining room; she opens the shutters, he puts the food on the table. They eat. They talk. Not about the flood. About\u2026coffee and bacon and butter and honey and other breakfasts, at Longbourn, at Pemberley, or in London. They talk about the family that lives in the cottage. He smiles. She laughs\u2014food tastes so good.\n\nThey talk about eating from expensive plates with silver spoons, on their own private desert island, in the middle of the muddy water. How strange it is, to be guests and ghosts in someone else\u2019s house.\n\nHe cannot take his eyes off her\u2014does not even try.\n\n\u201cYou saved my life,\u201d he says.\n\nElizabeth is very surprised. \u201cNot at all, Mr Darcy. I believe it is quite the opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I could not have left the boy to his fate. He would have drowned, and then it would have been too late for me to escape\u2014the water would have been too high.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou still could have swum to the next farm. Without being burdened by a terrified, helpless woman. I am, of course, always loath to contradict my husband, but I do believe you are the hero of this story, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he answers, smiling. \u201cMaybe this is a disagreement we do not really need to settle.\u201d\n\nShe smiles in return. \u201cIndeed.\u201d\n\n**\n\n\u201cAre we going to be trapped here for a while?\u201d she asks, when they are at the window, looking at the water.\n\n\u201cWe could be. We have enough food to survive for a week. But someone will come along.\u201d\n\nSomeone does. Five men, on the opposite bank, calling, looking for them. Darcy hails them. An hour later, a rowing boat comes.\n\n**\n\nPemberley.\n\nIt is a day of a million tasks, a million moments. As soon as they set foot in the house, they are engulfed. Half of the families of the estate are still sleeping on the ground floor. Darcy organises the men; he sends letters and expresses\u2014asking for help, buying food. Buying new seeds for spring\u2014most of them are lost.\n\nWater begins to recede around noon. Fast.\n\nHouses reappear from Atlantis. People are sent to save what there is to save, begin the clean-up process. Elizabeth has only one task: taking care of everything, for two hundred and fifty-three people (Mrs Reynolds counted them).\n\nElizabeth and Darcy\u2014they are together, but never together. She is running around. He is talking to people and giving instructions.\n\nShe is too busy to think of the silvery, shimmering bubble. She wonders whether it has split.\n\nAnd then\u2026\n\nDarcy is talking to his steward and two other men. She is walking through the room.\n\nTheir eyes meet.\n\nIt is like he has been waiting for this\u2014yes, for their eyes to meet. Like she has been waiting also.\n\nNow she is burning.\n\nShe cannot look at him any longer; she cannot even breathe. She flees down to the kitchen. \u201cYou should have some tea, Mrs Darcy,\u201d says Mrs Abbott, the cook. \u201cSit down here with us for a while. It is a jungle up there.\u201d\n\nIt is a jungle up there. Elizabeth laughs and sits down. She drinks the tea; she talks and jokes. She tells the story of the boy and the cottage and the water. The boy is alive, by the way. Safe and sound, at Pemberley, with the others.\n\nShe longs to go back upstairs. To see whether she can meet Darcy\u2019s eyes again.\n\nShe goes upstairs. Their eyes meet again.\n\nForget about the bubble. Spikes of burning metal, hope, and fear. She smiles and nods and walks away. Darcy follows her into the hall, moments after. He calls to her, walks to her, takes her hand in his. He begins to say something. Someone comes along; he has to let her go.\n\nThen that is what they do all day. Their jobs. Their eyes meet. They steal moments. In halls. Between two doors. They touch. A quick squeeze of the hand. A brush on the shoulder. A hand on her waist, in passing. He always initiates it.\n\nShe burns.\n\n**\n\nShe almost cannot believe it.\n\nAnd then she begins to doubt it.\n\n**\n\nIt is a wave of grey. Of panic.\n\n**\n\n\u201cElizabeth, I have to speak to you,\u201d Darcy says, in a hall, between two doors, her hand in his. \u201cPlease. I want to\u2026 Tonight?\u201d he asks, and she just nods.\n\nPanic rises higher.\n\nShe does not know why, really. She is a rational being, and if she thinks rationally about what happened over the last few days (weeks? months?) the verdict seems clear. She is twenty-two, not an innocent in the ways of the world. The Elizabeth of before has flirted at dozens of balls and is (or was) perfectly capable of sparking interest and recognising attraction.\n\nBut the Elizabeth of before had not drowned in grey.\n\nThis Elizabeth is afraid\u2014of hoping and losing hope, of giving herself and being trampled upon, of loving and being spited. This Elizabeth sees it, though. She sees how beautiful it could be; she sees the possibilities and the grace. She wants to cry at the idea that it could not happen. It would save them; it would save both of them. She knows now how near he is from drowning too, how maybe he has already drowned, and she is the one that can drag him back. Yes, she is so desperate she wants to beg.\n\nSo she does.\n\n**\n\nNight.\n\nWhen she retires to her chambers, her hands are trembling. She sits on a sofa in her parlour; she watches the door. The one that leads to his chamber, to the blue shirt, to books and mahogany.\n\nHe enters. He is pale and nervous. She politely asks him to sit down. He does.\n\nThen she kneels before him.\n\n\u201cI do not know what you want to tell me, sir, but please\u2014listen to me first.\u201d\n\nShe sees him freeze. But she has to go on. \u201cI know that you despise me\u2014not me, exactly, maybe,\u201d she adds quickly, \u201cbut my family and my connections\u2014but\u2026 Please listen.\u201d He is livid, petrified. \u201cPlease\u2014I beg you\u2014let me be a wife to you. I can be a good wife to you. I can help you. I can be your companion, your confidante. I can love you. We can both\u2026\u201d She shakes her head; it is difficult to find the words. \u201cWe can both\u2026\u201d\n\nShe loses her voice. Then she finds herself standing up\u2014she does not know how. He has his hands on her arms; his grip is so tight.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing I want more,\u201d he whispers, and she does not move\u2014she is frozen too now, hardly breathing, their foreheads so close, everything so close. \u201cElizabeth, there is nothing in the world that I want more,\u201d he repeats, his voice breaking. \u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\nHe is caressing her arms. He stops.\n\n\u201cBut you are in the throes of a misunderstanding,\u201d he says, his voice still broken. \u201cThat is why\u2026why I have to speak to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not sure I follow, Mr Darcy.\u201d (She has no voice either.)\n\n\u201cPlease, sit down.\u201d\n\nShe does. She is scared again. He paces the room.\n\n\u201cWhen I came back into Hertfordshire,\u201d he begins. She simply listens. \u201cWhen I came back into Hertfordshire, the second time. I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhen I came back into Hertfordshire, the second time,\u201d Darcy says, \u201cit was to see you.\u201d\n\nElizabeth frowns. \u201cI\u2026am not sure I follow.\u201d\n\nHe does not meet her gaze. \u201cI fell in love with you very early on. Even before you and your sister came to stay at Netherfield, I believe. But I was convinced that the disparities in our families\u2019 situations made an alliance between us impossible. Then I saw you again at Rosings Park, and\u2026\u201d\n\nDarcy raises his eyes to her\u2014she is petrified. He is very pale; his voice is low, tentative.\n\n\u201cI remember each of our dinners, each of our walks. Every detail\u2014every word, every gesture of yours. I was struggling. I walked to the Parsonage a dozen times, wanting to propose, but then\u2014I\u2026\u201d His voice breaks. \u201cI was a fool.\u201d\n\nThere is a pause. The fire crackles. Somewhere below, two hundred and fifty-three people are trying to sleep. Somewhere east, houses are still submerged under freezing water. Elizabeth feels stretched between two times, two realities. Her mind is going to tear, like a sheet of paper.\n\n\u201cI left\u2014again, for London. I could not forget you,\u201d Darcy explains\u2014it is almost a whisper. \u201cI came back home\u2014to Pemberley\u2014but I could not forget you here, either. I saw you in every lane, in every room.\u201d\n\nElizabeth closes her eyes. She can see it too, her ghost, near the lake, under the lime trees. In the hall, near the eastern window. Down the stairs, looking up at him. She feels like crying.\n\n\u201cI heard about the death of your father. Bingley was already betrothed to Amelia\u2026 But I\u2026\u201d Darcy stands up, begins to pace the room. \u201cI knew the house was entailed. I had heard that money was\u2014that you were in reduced circumstances. You had to move away, to give room to your cousin. Miss Bingley informed me with a sort of\u2014glee.\u201d\n\nElizabeth could see it. Could hear it\u2014Caroline Bingley\u2019s voice. Coming through a fog. It was all very far away.\n\n\u201cI mention the glee,\u201d Darcy adds, \u201cbecause that moved me. I imagined the worst. I saw your situation as even more dire than it really was, I suppose. I imagined the Miss Bingleys of the world, sneering at your family. So I had to see you.\u201d\n\nElizabeth is very still. \u201cTo propose?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe\u2014yes\u2014I do not think I had reached a decision, one way or the other.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI suppose I deliberately placed myself where I would not be able to resist my feelings for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Elizabeth protests. She cannot make sense of his words. Everything is upside down. The geography of the past, falling apart, like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. \u201cI\u2026 You did not even visit\u2014did you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\nElizabeth stands up too. \u201cI apologise, Mr Darcy,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter my father\u2019s death, after Jane\u2019s marriage, I\u2026 Everything I remember is hazy.\u201d\n\nShe takes a few slow steps. It is raining in her mind. Pieces of time, of reality, falling around her, crashing to the floor. In that tiny cottage, near her aunt Phillips\u2014a cottage they were not sure they could really afford, that they were not sure they could really keep. Her mother, screeching. In the narrow halls, under the low ceilings. Saying\u2014screaming\u2014that it was Elizabeth\u2019s fault Jane had to marry so low (a reverend\u2014rather poor). Screaming that if Elizabeth had accepted Mr Collins, they could have waited. Jane would not have been forced to throw herself away.\n\nLoud accusations. Incessant. Ghastly. True.\n\n\u201cI visited the day after my arrival,\u201d Darcy says, \u201cto offer my condolences to your family. Then a second time\u2014I do not recall the pretext I used. Your mother rang for tea. You were there\u2014in the drawing room\u2014but you did not speak. You were wearing a black bombazine dress\u2014with a little lace, just here\u2026\u201d\n\nHe moves his hand in the direction of Elizabeth\u2019s collarbone\u2014the gesture is so tender. So gentle. Sadness is choking her again.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d she repeats. \u201cMy memory is all a haze.\u201d\n\nHer turn to pace the room. Trying not to walk on the pieces (her past, lying on the floor).\n\n\u201cSo that is why you agreed to marry me,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter the scandal\u2026\u201d Elizabeth hesitates. \u201cAfter you found me in that barn\u2026 It was clearly an accident\u2014and, even so, after Lydia\u2019s elopement had dishonoured us all, you could not have been expected\u2026 You were not honour bound in any way to\u2026a daughter of such a family. All the blame would have fallen on me. And yet\u2026you acceded to my mother\u2019s every demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI loved you. I still do.\u201d\n\nHe cannot keep his eyes away. He is staring at her, studying her with such an intensity as if he wants to see through her skin\u2014straight to the inside of her soul. To see every movement, every thought.\n\nSilence falls.\n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Elizabeth massages her temples.\n\nThe wedding night.\n\nDarcy\u2019s anger, his insults.\n\n\u201cBut then\u2026\u201d\n\nShe does not have to say it aloud. He sits down. He seems very tired. \u201cDearest, I cannot explain myself,\u201d he whispers. She hears despair. Fear. \u201cI\u2026 My conduct does not make sense to me, either.\u201d\n\nTwo hundred and fifty-three people, trying to sleep downstairs. And both of them, now.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand how\u2026miraculous it all was,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe barn, your mother\u2019s pleas\u2014they were the perfect pretext. I had been struggling between love and duty, and suddenly, both were aligned. \nYou were ruined, I had to marry you. But I still\u2026\u201d\n\nFamily. Society. Expectations. Circles. The snake, hissing in his ears, telling him how selfish he was.\n\n\u201cThere is no excuse for the way I acted that night. I was not thinking straight. I suppose\u2014if I have to find an explanation\u2026\u201d His voice is low, again. \u201cI suppose I believed that if I voiced my misgivings aloud, we would fight. You would be offended, furious. You would tell me how ridiculous I was.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wished to lay it all to rest,\u201d Elizabeth says, slowly. \u201cYou wanted to give me your black pebbles of doubt, so I could laugh at them and crush them and reduce them to dust.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 That is a strange way to define it, but, yes. I suppose you are right.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd instead, I\u2026\u201d\n\nShe stops.\n\n\u201cAnd instead,\u201d he says, \u201cI crushed you.\u201d\n\n**\n\nThe conversation ends there. He stays on the sofa, watching her. She is pacing the room, kicking pieces of time as she goes. Memories changing their skins. Worlds shifting and restructuring. It is an unpleasant process. She sees herself through Darcy\u2019s eyes: a silent, sad maid sitting in a parlour, in a black bombazine dress\u2014whom he wants to save. Whom he wants to hold in his arms and cherish.\n\nHe sees her ghost in every lane, and then he saves her, and he gets the ghost.\n\nShe returns to that moment in the parlour\u2014that piece of her past that she does not even remember. She sees it like a scene in a play. Her mother is serving tea. Kitty must be out, visiting. Mary must be in the other room, reading\u2014there is no pianoforte for her to play. Mary hates Elizabeth now. Elizabeth not marrying Mr Collins is the reason there is no pianoforte for her to play. After the barn, Elizabeth begs Mary to stay silent\u2014to not go to her mother\u2014but of course Mary does her duty. So much resentment in her sister\u2019s eyes.\n\nBut back to that moment (the one Elizabeth does not even remember). The parlour. Darcy\u2019s second visit. She is sitting on the beige sofa, far away from her mother. Far away from him. Maybe it is a sunny day, light filtering through the glass, dust dancing in the air. Her black dress, with a little lace around the collar\u2014Elizabeth is not talking. Darcy is looking at her.\n\nA false image, from a false memory. It changes the past, though. A little. It cannot change her father\u2019s death, her mother\u2019s hatred, her sister\u2019s bitterness. Jane\u2019s loss. But\u2014Elizabeth was so lonely. And now she knows, there was somebody who\u2014who loved her.\n\nThose grey days begin to take on a fragile, silver hue.\n\n\u201cElizabeth,\u201d Darcy whispers, now, at Pemberley. (He cannot take his eyes off her. Like in that memory. The false one.) \u201cElizabeth, I can bear anything\u2014your anger, your reproaches\u2014but not your silence. Please, I beg you\u2014tell me what you are thinking.\u201d\n\nThere is no anger. Instead, she feels her heart is bursting. She wants to stand up back in that drawing room, in the tiny cottage, in her black dress, with her mother watching. She wants to walk to him and tell him that she is so sorry\u2014for everything that has not yet come to pass\u2014that she did not understand him before but that she understands him now. That they can avoid months of pain; that she wants to love him now.\n\nShe looks at him in the present. What he sees in her eyes is enough. He stands up and walks right to her\u2014then stops (love and shyness and fear). She puts her hand on his heart\u2014on the light blue shirt (except, it is not really the light blue shirt, of course).\n\nHe covers her hand with his.\n\n**\n\nTheir first night is awkward and tender. Everything in the dark. The candle on the side table has burned out. Elizabeth keeps her shift; he keeps his shirt. His gestures are tentative, and she does not know what to do. It does not hurt, but it is so odd. Out of her realm of experience. She has no words, no context for what is happening.\n\nThe room is different, she realises, while their bodies are intertwined. He is kissing her. She feels his skin and his weight. Her bedchamber\u2014it was grey\u2014it had been grey for months. Now\u2026well, it is still dark, with the curtains drawn, but\u2014it is different.\n\nHe stammers words of love in her ear and she\u2014she holds him so tight.\n\n**\n\nThe sun has risen.\n\nShe opens her eyes. He is sleeping besides her.\n\nShe hears him breathing. Everything is so still. She stays still, too. Moving is a risk. The moment could shatter.\n\nMemories move in the air, a slow silver dance. The sad ones, the new ones. Melancholy. Joy. His words. His embrace.\n\nImages of the night. The closeness and the flesh\u2014again, she has no words\u2014a gentleman\u2019s daughter does not learn those. She wonders whether she will ever get used to this strange, gorgeous, barbaric ritual. \nShe wonders if women who\u2014fallen women\u2014when they\u2014if they ever become blas\u00e9 about such intimacy.\n\nShe feels like she never will.\n\n**\n\nElizabeth starts. The sun is warmer\u2014it must be late. Two hundred and fifty-three people and the servants, waiting\u2014her maid and Darcy\u2019s valet are helping downstairs. She rises up from the bed as silently as she can. She dresses as silently as she can. She braids and twists and pins her hair as silently as she can.\n\nThe result is\u2026commendable. Twenty-one years at Longbourn, five sisters, one maid.\n\n\u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d His voice.\n\n\u201cYou must be in love, Mr Darcy.\u201d She laughs. No jewels; she is wearing an old dark-purple dress. The fabric can survive sick children, stew, and crying widows.\n\nShe sits on the bed. To smile at him. He grabs her by the waist. \u201cYou are not thinking of leaving, I hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems I cannot.\u201d She lies down on the cover, alongside him. Rising on one elbow, studying his face. She kisses him, once, on the lips.\n\n\u201cYou must understand, I would like to leave,\u201d she states. \u201cI very much desire to speak to Mrs Reynolds about mildew, sickness, and soup. But would a dutiful wife disobey her husband?\u201d\n\nShe thinks he is going to answer in kind, that he will joke along, but he does not. He keeps watching her.\n\n\u201cI am so happy,\u201d he says, slowly.\n\nShe is very conscious of the stillness of the room. Of the rays of the sun, on the bed.\n\n\u201cI should not be,\u201d he continues. \u201cPeople have lost everything\u2014lost loved ones. It will be years till they recover. The estate will suffer substantial losses. It will be years till we recover.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall be by your side,\u201d Elizabeth says.\n\nShe feels sadness again\u2014tenderness too strong in her heart, the desire to shield him against the future and the past, against exhaustion and heartbreak. She caresses his cheek; she touches her lips once more. Afterwards, his eyes are a little too bright. He puts his hand on her nape, draws her closer.\n\nKisses are silver and endless.\n\n\u201cStill, I do not feel guilty,\u201d he says. \u201cMy thoughts are too full of you.\u201d\n\nElizabeth reflects for a while. \u201cThe flood is not your fault,\u201d she muses, after a moment. He looks at her ponderingly. \u201cYou feel everything is your responsibility,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut this disaster is the will of providence. It is not mismanagement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is mismanagement,\u201d he grumbles. \u201cBut not mine.\u201d Elizabeth heard it downstairs\u2014the dams, it seems, were not well maintained.\n\n\u201cThat is why you can allow yourself to be happy in this moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mind works in bizarre ways,\u201d he whispers. Before drawing her close again.\n\n**\n\nShe goes downstairs. She enters the summer drawing room. The large glass doors are open; they connect the east parlour and the music room beyond. Elizabeth freezes.\n\nThe image is so striking, she can hardly breathe.\n\nColours, inching closer.\n\nThis part of the house was flooded during the first rising. The waters have receded, leaving everything covered in mud\u2014a lost, monochrome world.\n\nThis morning, clean-up began.\n\nOn the right, greyish beige, everywhere. To the left, servants moping and wiping and washing and polishing\u2014exposing golden oak floors, blue sofas, red tapestries, lavender walls.\n\nColours, eating the grey away.\n\nMetaphor, embodied.\n\n**\n\nHer husband comes down. He stands behind her; he puts his arms around her waist again. Together, they watch. Mrs Reynolds walks through the room, giving instructions to an army of helpers. She seems exhausted, and it is only ten.\n\nShe hardly notices them.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Elizabeth whispers to her husband, when the housekeeper has gone, \u201cyou are right. My mind works in bizarre ways indeed.\u201d She hesitates. \u201cI\u2026 Sometimes, I see the world differently.\u201d\n\nHe hesitates too. Then, \u201cSo do I.\u201d\n\nHe tells her about the circles. She tells him about the colours."
