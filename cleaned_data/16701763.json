    "text": "\n\u201cIs that me or you, buddy?\u201d Eddie asked as he picked through Mrs. Chen\u2019s snack rack. \n\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n\nVenom\u2019s voice rumbled in his head, shaking his bones. Eddie was almost used to it. He shrugged. \u201cBeen feeling weird, is all.\u201d\n\n\nWeird?\n\n\n\u201cYeah, weird.\u201d Eddie pulled up a bag of pork rinds then immediately put them back when Venom recoiled in disgust. \u201cYou know, just not quite right. Like I got a cold coming on or something.\u201d \n\n\nWe don\u2019t get colds, Eddie. \n\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I asked.\u201d He ignored the dude who gave him a why-is-that-guy-talking-to-himself look as he picked out a bag of potato chips. \u201cDo symbiotes get sick in other ways?\u201d he asked, moving toward the back of the store. \n\n\nOf course not.\n\n\nEddie paused at the tone in Venom\u2019s voice. He\u2019d never heard the symbiote sound like that, so it took him a minute to recognize defensiveness. \n\n\nWe are \n\nnot\n\n getting defensive. \n\n\nEddie snorted. \u201cUh-huh. Sure.\u201d\n\n\nWe are NOT.\n\n\nThe last word boomed in his skull and Eddie put up his hands in surrender, nearly dropping the bags of snacks he\u2019d already picked out. \u201cOk, ok! Yeesh.\u201d He wasn\u2019t convinced, and Venom knew it from the grumbling Eddie heard in his head. But Eddie let it go for now. He reached out to a random magazine rack, not paying attention to where his wandering had placed him. \n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until he\u2019d pulled a magazine out and casually opened it that he realized he was looking at a porno mag. \n\n\nEddie blinked, his eyes not registering the naked tiddies for a second. When he did, he shook his head and slapped the magazine shut, hurriedly putting it back on the rack. \n\n\nWhat was that?\n\n\n\u201cNothin, nothin,\u201d Eddie replied, waving Venom off like an annoying fly. He hurried toward the counter. \n\n\nEddie, you don\u2019t have to be embarrassed about liking a rocking pair of tits. \n\n\n\u201cI am not talking to you about this right now.\u201d He gave Mrs. Chen a smile that she warily returned. \n\n\nNow who\u2019s defensive? \n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your friend, Eddie?\u201d Mrs. Chen whispered to him. \n\n\nEddie scratched at his cheek, coughing awkwardly. \u201cOh, they\u2019re fine, you know, adjusting and all.\u201d \n\n\nAny more turds bothering her? \n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had any other bad customers since\u2026 well, you know,\u201d Mrs. Chen said as if she\u2019d heard Venom\u2019s question. \n\n\n\u201c\nGood.\n\u201d Eddie jumped when Venom\u2019s voice coated over his. He frowned, hissing, \u201cBe polite.\u201d \n\n\nWith one more little wave to a shaken Mrs. Chen, Eddie hurried back out with his snacks in tow. \n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nA week later, Eddie had identified what the weird feeling was: fucking horny as fuck. Normally he wouldn\u2019t mind, but as he came for the second time in one night and found his stupid cock \n\nstill hard\n\n, he knew something was wrong. \n\n\n\u201cWhat is \n\nhappening!?\n\n\u201d he panted. He was laying flat on his back in his bed, naked and sweating like a pig. His sheets were soaked and clinging uncomfortably to his flushed skin. It felt like the worst fever he\u2019d ever had in his life. It felt like there was a nest of bees under his skin, like he would shake apart completely if he didn\u2019t get\u2026 \n\nsomething\n\n. \n\n\nVenom receded from their ministrations, gooey black tentacles slipping back into Eddie\u2019s body from where they\u2019d been stroking his erection. Little droplets of inky black speckled up his stomach to suck up the last sprinkling of cum he\u2019d jacked out of Eddie. \n\n\nEddie waited for some smartass reply\u2026 but none came. He blinked, focusing in, and felt Venom coil tighter in his chest. Embarrassed? \n\n\nNo!\n\n\nEddie made an exasperated noise. \u201cJust fucking tell me!\u201d he hollered at the ceiling. \u201cMy dick\u2019s gonna fall off soon if you don\u2019t tell me what\u2019s wrong!\u201d \n\n\nVenom writhed under his skin, clearly agitated, and most definitely embarrassed. \nWe should take time off work.\n\n\n\u201cI knew you were sick!\u201d \n\n\nNot sick! Just\u2026 in season. \n\n\nEddie blinked. He\u2019d never known Venom to by shy about anything. The symbiote just blurted out whatever was on their mind. How the hell would an alien even know about stupid human emotions like shame? But that was, for sure, what Eddie felt from Venom now, or at least the symbiote approximation of it. \n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d he asked, but tried to keep the bite from his voice. \n\n\nMating season. \n\n\nVenom squirmed in his chest while a whole lot of emotions rolled through Eddie. He blinked a few times, mouth hanging open stupidly. \u201cMate-mating? Like, sexual, mating?\u201d \n\n\nNo, platonic mating. \n\nYes,\n\n sexual mating, dumbass. \n\n\nEddie ignored the sarcastic remark. He sat up on his elbows, mind churning with this new information. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fucking already. How is this different?\u201d \n\n\nPrimal. Dominating. Uncontrollable. \n\n\nHuman words seemed to fail Venom, so they supplied a taste of the \n\nfeeling\n\n of it. Eddie\u2019s eyes widened as the hunger for it practically punched him in the gut. It was similar to Venom\u2019s usual hunger, but with an added layer of bone-deep lust so strong Eddie nearly came on the spot just from the second of sensation. It was like being plunged into a boiling ocean of pure, instinctual need. \n\n\nHe gasped when Venom pulled the feeling back from him, panting and sweating anew. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hiding this from me?\u201d\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n\u201cHow?!\u201d \n\n\nThis is not our first rodeo, Eddie. \n\n\nEddie rubbed at his face. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell me? You\u2019ve never kept anything from me since that first time.\u201d The twinge of hurt that came through his question surprised even Eddie. \n\n\nVenom flinched at Eddie\u2019s words, and quickly manifested a tiny version of their head out from Eddie\u2019s chest so they could actually look at each other. \n\u201cWe weren\u2019t due for another few years, in human time. We weren\u2019t prepared for it to happen so early,\u201d \nVenom growled, lips sliding over their needle-small teeth. They were still wearing their perpetual grin, but Eddie could see the emotions behind it now. Venom was practically pouting. \n\n\n\u201cSo, you were embarrassed?\u201d \n\n\nVenom shook their head, bobbing back and forth on their little black tendril. \n\u201cWe did not want to frighten Eddie.\u201d \n\n\nEddie snorted. \u201cFrighten me? Buddy, I think we\u2019re way past that--\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThis is different,\u201d\n Venom interjected, their head floating a little closer to Eddie\u2019s, opalescent eyes boring into the human\u2019s. Eddie could feel the nerves rolling off Venom in waves. The only time they\u2019d felt this was before their fight with Riot\u2026 \n\u201cWe have been on the receiving end. It can be unpleasant.\u201d \n\n\nEddie\u2019s expression fell as his heart leapt into his throat. It wasn\u2019t coincidence he\u2019d thought of the other symbiote. Did Venom mean that\u2026 \u201cYou were Riot\u2019s\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cBitch. Yes.\u201d \n\n\nEddie gulped, scratching at his temple and glancing away. \u201cWasn\u2019t gonna say it like that.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWe told you we were something of a loser too.\u201d \n\n\nEddie frowned. \u201cBeing on the receiving end isn\u2019t a bad thing,\u201d he grumbled, suddenly self-conscious. \n\n\nVenom\u2019s head nuzzled against his cheek, a purr leaking from their toothy grin. \n\u201cWe know, Eddie. But that is not how Riot saw it.\u201d \n\n\nEddie brought a hand up to stroke over Venom\u2019s head, marveling as always at the slick, silky texture of them. Venom shivered, and Eddie felt it through his whole body. \u201cSo, I\u2019m guessing this ain\u2019t gonna just go away.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cNope.\u201d \n\n\nEddie felt a smirk pull up the side of his mouth. He reached his free hand for his phone on the bedside table, pulling up a new text message. \n\n\nVenom\u2019s head swiveled to look. \n\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cCalling off work. How long do you think we\u2019ll need?\u201d \n\n\nVenom, for once, was speechless, until, \n\u201cYou\u2019re actually going to \n\nlisten\n\n to us?\u201d \n\n\nEddie rolled his eyes. \u201cOh come on, I listen.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cNo you fucking don\u2019t! All you do is boss us around. Always, don\u2019t eat this, don\u2019t eat that, be nice, be polite, blah blah blah.\u201d \nTheir tongue lolled out comically at the last three words, but that tongue still managed to knock Eddie\u2019s train of thought loose for a second. Fuck, he really was still horny as shit.\n\n\nVenom gave him one of his winning grins, and Eddie just rolled his eyes again. \u201cHow long?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cA week. At least.\u201d \n\n\nEddie\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cA week?\u201d he sputtered. Venom just bobbed their little head in front of him. Eddie blew out a breath. \u201cAlright, a fuckin week, let\u2019s do this.\u201d \n\n\nEddie\u2019s fingers froze right before he hit send, his thumb hovering over the button. He blinked, feeling Venom holding him still. \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\nVenom\u2019s head sank back into him, disappearing into his chest. \nAre you sure about this? \n\n\nVenom\u2019s tone once again surprised Eddie. Cautious. Nervous. Scared? \u201cOk, now you\u2019re really making me worried.\u201d\n\n\nIt is uncontrollable once it starts, Eddie. We \n\nwill\n\n make you ours. \n\n\nEddie licked his lips, feeling a shiver of want go through him. \u201cThen make me yours,\u201d he breathed, face flushing at how breathy and needy the words came out. \n\nShit,\n\n he was horny. \n\n\nVenom trembled inside of him, a growl vibrating every inch of Eddie\u2019s skin. \n\nEddie\u2026\n\n\n\nEddie could feel Venom holding themselves back, but he didn\u2019t want Venom to hold back anymore. Eddie wanted everything. He was damn smitten with the stupid alien, and if this was part of it, he wanted it. \n\n\nAre you sure?\n Venom asked again, lower this time, rumbling through Eddie\u2019s chest. \u00a0\n\n\nEddie took a breath. \u201cYou won\u2019t hurt me, right?\u201d \n\n\nVenom paused only for a second. \nNot in any way we won\u2019t like. \n\n\nKinky. Eddie glanced back at his phone screen. \u201cThen I\u2019m sure. I trust you, babe.\u201d \n\n\nVenom trembled again inside of him, and finally released his fingers. Eddie hit send, then leaned back, tossing his phone back on the bedside table. He grinned, nerves dancing through his chest and down his spine. \n\n\nVenom flowed within him, some of their eagerness, their \n\nneed\n\n, leaking through. Eddie took a shaky breath, his skin on fire again, cock hard and leaking. \u201cVenom,\u201d he croaked. His throat was parched, dry as a desert. \u201cMake me yours.\u201d \n\n\n\nEddiiiie\u2026 \n\n\n\nA moan pushed out of Eddie\u2019s throat. He laid back completely on the damp bed and ran his hands down his chest and hips. His cock dribbled an embarrassing amount of pre onto his stomach at the movement. \n\n\nVenom made a noise, half groan, half snarl. They coalesced above Eddie, starting with their head, their full, terrifying size now. More of their body followed, until all of Venom but that thin lifeline still attached to Eddie was out. Those shiny teeth hovered over Eddie\u2019s face, Venom\u2019s massive, muscular form crouched over Eddie like the predator they were. \n\n\nThey were vibrating with tension, tendrils of their form splitting off and lashing out. \n\nChrist, Venom was big. \n\n\n\nVenom\u2019s grin stretched wider at Eddie\u2019s thought. They trembled with eagerness, back arched, claws clenching into the bedsheets on either side of Eddie\u2019s head. \n\n\nEddie gulped, staring up with wide eyes. He pushed away the stupid macho thoughts that always tried to derail moments like this. He knew what he liked, what he wanted. It didn\u2019t make him less of a man if he wanted a giant alien to stick it up his ass. \n\n\nSwallowing that useless, manly pride, Eddie slowly reached up to run his rough fingers over the side of Venom\u2019s face. \u201cWhy did it start early?\u201d he breathed, pretty sure he knew the reason.\n\n\nVenom shivered again, their tongue sliding out from between those gnashing, endless teeth. \n\u201cEddie is irresistible,\u201d\n they purred. \n\u201cEddie did this to us. Too perfect. Too \n\ndelicious.\n\n\u201d \n\n\nEddie grinned, his fingers tracing down to one of Venom\u2019s teeth, sliding over the smooth, bony structure, grazing his fingertip over the razor sharp point. \u201cThat eager to make me your bitch, huh? You had to start early?\u201d \n\n\nVenom\u2019s control broke. Their snarl of lust roared in Eddie\u2019s head and ears before Venom\u2019s tongue slammed into his mouth. \n\n\nEddie\u2019s eyes opened wide, his body going limp, immediately opening up for Venom. He choked out a groan as Venom\u2019s tongue dove into his mouth then burrowed down his throat. Venom snarled, pushing their head closer to sink a good twelve inches of their tongue down Eddie\u2019s gullet. \n\n\nEddie was once again in the ocean of Venom\u2019s lust, nothing held back this time. His entire body ached to be filled. He moaned around Venom\u2019s tongue, sucking as much as he could, though it was a lost cause, really. Venom brought their gaping maw closer, their rows and rows of teeth filling Eddie\u2019s vision. \n\n\nVenom grabbed onto Eddie\u2019s head with one giant hand, the other wrapping around his shoulders, pinning him to the bed. His eyes rolled at feeling completely helpless, immobile. He could feel his throat bulging with Venom\u2019s fleshy tongue currently occupying it, but he didn\u2019t need air. Venom took care of him, like always. \n\n\nVenom growled in his face, shivering at Eddie\u2019s submission. Symbiote drool rolled down Eddie\u2019s face, but he loved it, loved every part of Venom. \n\n\nThe first thrust with that huge, squishy tongue made Eddie instantly come. His body pulled up taught like a drawn bow, his cock valiantly spurting a good few globs over his stomach. \n\n\n\nFuck, oh FUCK! \n\n\n\nHe was still hard. So hard it hurt. Coming seemed to only make him hornier, something Eddie had never experienced. Had never had to wrap his mind around. He clawed at Venom\u2019s giant shoulders, needy, begging, edging on panicked. \n\n\nWe have you, Eddie.\n\n\nVenom\u2019s voice soothed Eddie\u2019s panic in an instant, a moment of cool in the heat storm that their bodies had become. He closed his eyes, body going limp again, and Venom growled happily. \n\n\nTheir tongue thrust into him, the strokes hard enough to snap his neck if he weren\u2019t connected to Venom from his very soul. Saliva bubbled up around Eddie\u2019s stretched lips, wet grunts and gurgles just barely making it out. Eddie swore he could feel Venom licking his lungs, they were so deep. The claws around his head stroked his neck with each thrust, rubbing the bulge there, using him like he was little more than a wet, warm hole to fuck. \n\n\nEddie\u2019s eyelids fluttered at the thought, the depraved part of his brain latching onto the thought. Just a hole. Just a hole for his symbiote. \n\n\nVenom\u2019s massive body writhed at that thought, pushing closer to Eddie. Their claws snapped down to slide around and under Eddie\u2019s hips and ass, lifting his bottom half up. \n\n\nEddie gurgled a moan around the tongue still slithering back and forth in his throat. He let his legs fall open, welcoming Venom\u2019s hips to slot between his legs--\n\n\nHis eyes popped open as he felt something hard and thick and \n\nlong\n\n slide along his groin. Holy shit, the fucking thing reached all the way past his belly button, rubbing along the sticky cum from Eddie\u2019s last orgasm. Eddie might be a bit of a size queen, but that thing was just--just ridiculously huge. \n\n\nThe rational part of his brain screamed in pure terror, but Eddie\u2019s body wasn\u2019t listening. His cock gave another spurt of precum, dribbling out like it had an endless supply. \n\n\nThat\u2019s right, this will be in you soon. You will know nothing but us, \n\nfeel\n\n nothing but ussss\u2026\n\n\nEddie whimpered around Venom\u2019s tongue, truly unsure if his body could handle something like that, but he didn\u2019t care. He wanted it. He wanted Venom to break him. \n\n\nVenom snarled again before their tongue slithered back out of Eddie\u2019s mouth. Eddie gasped, coughing out a rough moan now that his mouth was free. Venom purred, slurping their tongue along his jaw and down his neck. \n\n\nSay it. \n\n\n\u201c\n\nFuck!\n\n\u201d Eddie panted. His eyes were unfocused, his thoughts filled with nothing but the need to be filled, spread. \u201cVen-Venom!\u201d he whimpered. \n\n\nVenom\u2019s claws squeezed his ass, a few tentacles of their form splitting from them and shoving into Eddie\u2019s twitching asshole. \n\n\n \u201cFFU-AUGH!\u201d Eddie shouted, tears welling up in his eyes as Venom burrowed into him. The tentacles writhed and pushed, twisting together to form a thicker and thicker limb. \n\n\nSAY IT.\n\n\n\u201cFuck! Fuck, Venom, oh my god, please! \n\nPlease\n\n, ruin me!\u201d Eddie sobbed out. The tentacles were making him slicker, spreading him open, pressing, filling, pushing the insides of his body. Making room? \u201cBreak me--\n\nuuhn--\n\nfuck-fucking break me!\u201d\n\n\nOurssss\u2026 \n\n\nEddie\u2019s pleas dissolved into wordless, needy noises that bubbled up from his open mouth. The tentacles were good but he needed more. He needed the real thing, all of it, all of Venom. He was going to die if he didn\u2019t get it. His body would burn up into nothing. He didn\u2019t notice how hard he was trembling, or the way he was gasping for breath like a fish. \u201cPlease\n\n, please!\n\n\u201d he wheezed, lips numb, tears streaming down his face. Venom licked them right up, grinning down at him. \n\n\nEddie, our Eddie. \n\n\nVenom crooned his name in his head while the tentacles worked him open, spreading him wide. Eddie whimpered, feeling himself gaping, stretching easier than he ever had before. Was this all because of Venom\u2019s heat?\n\n\nEddie, you need to stretch wider if you\u2019re going to take us.\n\n\nVenom sounded delighted at the prospect, and Eddie didn\u2019t have the mind to think on the words before a few of the tentacles hooked around the rim of his asshole and \n\npulled.\n\n\n\nEddie howled as another orgasm tore through him. His cock was almost purple, spurting out more wetness to add to the mess of sweat, drool, and cum now covering him. \u201cPlease, please--\n\nahh-hah\n\n--gonna-I\u2019m gonna die, oh my god, Venom please, pl--\n\nhnng\n\n--babe please\u2026!\u201d \n\n\nEddie\u2019s body twitched helplessly. He felt hollow. A cold pit resided inside him, excruciating in the tempest of heat the rest of him had become. Nothing but Venom could fix it, could heal him, save him. He was drowning. Drowning and freezing and burning up all at the same time-- \n\n\nShhhh\u2026 \n\n\nVenom pushed just the tip of their tongue into Eddie\u2019s mouth and Eddie latched on like a suckling babe. He whimpered, clinging to the distraction of Venom\u2019s perfect tongue in his mouth, moaning around it. \n\n\nThe tentacles carefully receded. Only the ones hooking his asshole open stayed. Eddie sobbed at the loss of penetration, feeling wet and open and vulnerable. He shivered, hands grasping onto the curved back of Venom\u2019s neck, clenching into the material that made up the symbiote. \n\n\nVenom finally lined their monstrous cock up to Eddie\u2019s twitching entrance, his hole wet and red, leaking Venom\u2019s lubricant. Eddie flinched as the flared head kissed his open hole, whining desperately. He spit out Venom\u2019s tongue, gasping in air, his hips canting in Venom\u2019s grip. \u201cPlease, please, \n\nplease\u2026\n\n\u201d \n\n\nVenom wound his tongue around Eddie\u2019s neck, anchoring him in place. They were shivering again, more pieces of their form whipping out. They were starting to fill the entire bedroom, cords of black lashing around the small space and finding purchase on the walls, the ceiling, the floor. Almost like a web or a nest. \n\n\nThey hesitated for only a few more agonizing seconds, then in one brutal thrust, speared the entirety of their cock into Eddie. \n\n\n\u201cGUH--!\u201d The scant amount of air left in Eddie\u2019s lungs left in a whoosh. He might be screaming if he could breathe. He might have come again, but he couldn\u2019t tell. His vision had gone white. His body shook, his brain shorting out as the only thing he could think was \n\ntoo much too much too much!\n\n\n\nUntil Venom moaned. Actually moaned. The sound vibrated in Eddie\u2019s skull, their body trembling just as hard as Eddie\u2019s. Eddie slowly came back down from the shock of penetration. He blinked back the tears in his eyes, managing to sip in a couple shallow breaths. \n\n\nIn the moment of clarity, Eddie realized that Venom was overwhelmed too. This\u2026 this was their first time like this. The first time giving instead of taking it. And maybe the actual \n\nphysical\n\n process was different when it was symbiote on symbiote, but the feelings were the same. Emotions Eddie recognized with chilling familiarity came to him from Venom--violation, shame, fear--Venom had been fucking traumatized by Riot. \n\n\nDamn your human emotions. \n\n\nEddie glanced up at Venom\u2019s face, staring up into their beautiful eyes. He licked his dry lips, moving just a little, and gasped when he felt all of Venom lodged inside of him. \u201cDo I feel good?\u201d he grunted. \n\n\nVenom shivered, more tendrils of them shooting out and sticking to the bedroom walls. It was impossible to see anything else but them now from Eddie\u2019s spot in the very center of Venom\u2019s nest. The only place he\u2019d ever want to be. \n\n\nEddiiiiiiie\u2026 \n\n\nVenom\u2019s voice sounded wrecked in Eddie\u2019s head, and he grinned languidly. He\u2019d never heard the symbiote like this, and it was pretty big ego boost to think he could bring the terrifying symbiote to their metaphorical knees with the power of his asshole. \u201cYou\u2019re so fuckin\u2019 big, babe,\u201d he moaned. \u201cFeels so g-good in me.\u201d \n\n\nVenom moved a little, pushing their hips harder against Eddie\u2019s ass, and Eddie gave a broken sob as Venom ground themselves into Eddie\u2019s squishy, willing body. \u201c\n\nFuck\n\n, fuck, oh my god, jesus christ,\u201d Eddie panted, reaching a shaky hand down toward his stomach. His eyes widened when he felt the bulging curve of Venom\u2019s dick pushing up the skin of his stomach. \u201c\n\nHaa\n\n--ah god, fuck, h-how? How?!\u201d \n\n\nWe change each other, Eddie. \n\n\nVenom\u2019s tongue tightened around his neck before the symbiote moved. They pulled out only a couple inches, then pressed back in like the couldn\u2019t bare to have any part of their dick outside of his body. \u00a0\n\n\nEddie\u2019s mind scrambled as he felt the bulge fucking move inside of him. It shouldn\u2019t be possible, but he didn\u2019t care anymore. It felt so \n\nfucking\n\n good. \u201c\n\nNnnng\n\n--fuck, yes, babe, keep moving, f--\n\naauugh\n\n--fuck, fuck me, fuck me \n\nplease\n\n.\u201d \n\n\nVenom moaned again in Eddie\u2019s head while a bubbling snarl came out of their mouth. They pulled out halfway this time, and Eddie realized then that their cock was textured. His eyes crossed as he felt bumps and knots and ridges scraping out of his hole before it all shoved back in. \n\n\nEddie\u2019s hands scrambled to grip onto whatever part of Venom he could reach as Venom got their rhythm going, spearing themself into Eddie again and again, building speed with each brutal thrust. Eddie\u2019s back bowed, his stomach bulging every time Venom bottomed out in him.\n\n\nThe heat was building back up, but this time it was good. Eddie finally felt complete. The aching cold inside of him receded more every time Venom hilted themself. Venom\u2019s claws slid from grasping Eddie\u2019s ass to clench around his waist, holding so tight he felt skin break. It hurt good too, just like Venom had said it would, the sharp pinch of their claws only pushing more heat into Eddie\u2019s body. \n\n\nAs soon as the scent of Eddie\u2019s blood hit the air, Venom writhed. Eddie cried out, feeling the primal, vicious need sweep through them both. Venom roared, their head ducking down to latch their teeth into the meat of Eddie\u2019s shoulder. \n\n\nEddie screamed in both pain and bliss, his cock twitching in a dry orgasm, his balls tapped out. But it didn\u2019t matter. His spilled blood didn\u2019t matter. It all just went through Venom and then back to him. Nothing lost, because it was all them. There was no difference between Eddie and Venom. \u00a0\n\n\nYes YES OURS. \n\n\nVenom\u2019s entire being seemed to sing as Eddie embraced their shared bodies, their shared beings. Their pain and pleasure. Their heat. \n\n\nVenom bit him harder, healing any damage as soon as they made it, a constant cycle. \u00a0\n\n\nOurs, ours, \n\nours\n\n\u2026 \n\n\nVenom continued to croon as they fucked into Eddie with wild abandon. That cock speared into Eddie\u2019s body, the ridges and knots scraping past his entrance, making it impossible to completely adjust even with how malleable his body had become. Eddie was hardly making any sounds, his mouth hanging open, tongue lolling out. His body was completely overloaded with sensation, but he never wanted it to stop. He wanted to be Venom\u2019s vessel forever. He \n\nwould\n\n be Venom\u2019s vessel forever. \n\n\nVenom\u2019s pace picked up even more, thrusting frantically, his form clapping against Eddie\u2019s ass with every thrust. The heat was building to an almost unbearable level, cresting like a tidal wave about to break. Eddie whimpered, tipping his head to the side to kiss and lap at Venom\u2019s face, the symbiote\u2019s maw still latched onto his shoulder. It was ridiculous, like a kitten licking a velociraptor, but Venom shivered at the desperate little display. \n\n\nBoth of them were beyond words, caught up in their shared need. Eddie\u2019s eyes rolled back as he felt Venom\u2019s senses meld into his. He felt that giant cock slamming into him at an impossible pace, and he also felt the sensation of penetrating himself. Of dominating, laying his claim on his perfect vessel. It felt so \n\nright\n\n. \n\n\n\u201c\n\nOurs\u2026\n\n\u201d they moaned together, their souls aligning like twin pendulums. \n\n\nEddie!\n\n\nAnd Venom was coming. They slammed into him, finally unlatching their teeth from Eddie\u2019s shoulder to tip their head back and let out a thundering, triumphant roar. \n\n\nEddie keened along with them as what felt like gallons of lava pumped into his very core. Symbiote cum. That\u2019s what it was. Holy shit, Venom was coming inside of him. \n\n\nEddie\u2019s vision went white, tears streaming down his face as his stomach bloated with the sheer amount of seed. His belly rounded out, going taught as a drum, expanding more than should be possible, but they were long past the point of impossibility. A fucked out smile spread over Eddie\u2019s face, pleasure pulsing through him in violent waves. \n\n\nVenom\u2019s orgasm seemed to go on forever, even as the symbiote curled themself around Eddie, holding him tight. \n\n\nEddiieeee\u2026\n\n\nVenom licked over his face and neck with slow, soothing strokes, crooning his name over and over. \n\n\nAfter a few minutes, Eddie finally found the mental prowess to string some words together. \u201c\n\nHhnng\n\n\u2026 gonna fuckin pop, babe,\u201d he wheezed, the words slurred on his sex-drunk mouth. \n\n\nVenom chuckled in his head, giving him one more lick before they easily manipulated his body, flipping him over with their cock still lodged in his ass. \n\n\nEddie gave a weak moan, holding his stomach. The bed was a distant memory. All he could see was Venom everywhere, the ropes of their body completely suspending and cocooning them. \n\n\nVenom purred and leaned over Eddie\u2019s back, sinking their cock fully back into Eddie. An embarrassing burp left Eddie\u2019s mouth at the movement, tasting of Venom. He gasped for breath, dizzy with the heat and weight of Venom\u2019s seed. \n\n\nTime for round two. \n\n\n\u201cWait\u2026 what?\u201d \n\n\nVenom wrapped their arms around Eddie, holding him tight as they slowly started to rock into him again. \n\n\nEddie gave a panicked cry. \u201cOh my god, fuck! I can\u2019t, babe, I c--\n\nmmf!\n\n\u201d\n\n\nVenom\u2019s tongue slipped back into Eddie\u2019s mouth, effectively silencing his complaints. \n\n\nTold you, Eddie. \n\n\nThere was an edge in Venom\u2019s gravelly voice, their heat ramping back up, the next wave coming, as unstoppable as the tide. Eddie whimpered around that stupid, perfect tongue. He wouldn\u2019t last another round. Fuck, how many rounds would there be? Was he supposed to keep this up for an entire week?!\n\n\nIt\u2019s ok, Eddie. You can pass out. We\u2019ll take care of us. We\u2019ll always take care of us. \n\n\nEddie would have rolled his eyes if he were halfway more sane than he was. Currently though, he was fucked out of his goddamn mind, and passing out seemed like a lovely option. He shivered thinking of Venom continuing to use his unconscious body like a cum-dump, dredging up some of his most fucked up fantasies. \n\n\nVenom\u2019s strong, secure arms and the rhythmic rocking into his body pulled the argument right out of Eddie\u2019s mind. His body went completely limp, sinking back into his symbiote, and Venom purred at the submission. Eddie let his eyes close, trusting Venom with more than his life. He trusted them with everything he had. \n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe TV blared as Eddie shoveled a huge bite of Froot Loops into his mouth. He hummed contentedly, glad to have some real human food back in his stomach. \n\n\nSaturday morning cartoons may have been a strange way to end a week long, heat-induced, alien symbiote fuck fest, but Eddie thought it was perfect. \n\n\nAgreed.\n\n\nEddie chuckled, scooping another spoonful and holding it out. Venom\u2019s head coalesced from his shoulder and snapped out to take the offered cereal. Their tongue wound around the spoon, getting every last drop of milk on the way back. Eddie tore his gaze away, shivering despite himself. \n\n\nNot as good as potato. \n\n\n\u201cPsh, whatever\u201d Eddie mumbled around another bite for himself. \n\n\nVenom kept their head out and nuzzled against Eddie\u2019s neck instead of responding. They\u2019d been showing more affection than ever before, and Eddie didn\u2019t hate it. In fact, he sort of absolutely loved it. \u201cFeelin better, buddy?\u201d \n\n\nMuch.\n\n\nEddie watched the show mindlessly for another couple minutes, sharing bites between his mouth and Venom\u2019s. At the next commercial break he cleared his throat and tried to say as casually as possible, \u201cSo when\u2019s your next heat due?\u201d \n\n\nEager? \n\n\nEddie choked a little on a loop. He pounded on his chest, eyeing Venom in the corner of his eye. That stupid grin. \u201cJust wondering so I can--er, we can prepare. I can\u2019t just take a week off with barely any notice again.\u201d \n\n\nEddie tipped the bowl up to his lips to drink down the sugary milk. \n\n\nWe have about 30 days until the next one.\n\n\nNow Eddie really did choke. He coughed wetly, shakily dropping the bowl down on the coffee table. Venom gave him an assist, moving inside of him to suck up the bit of milk he\u2019d aspirated. \n\n\nIt was a joke, Eddie. \n\n\n\u201cOh. Yeah, right,\u201d Eddie replied, his cheeks warming. He cleared his throat again. \u201cYeah, yeah yeah, of course, of course.\u201d \n\n\nHeats are very rare, Eddie.\n\n\n\u201cUh-huh, yeah, right. Ok.\u201d \n\n\nThat we even went into ours early is almost unheard of.\n\n\n\u201cCool, cool cool.\u201d \n\n\nIt will be years in human time before it happens again. \n\n\nEddie blew out a relieved breath, rubbing his stomach. He was still slightly bloated from\u2026 everything. He definitely wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that again any time soon. He tried to tell himself this to cover up the itty bitty feeling of disappointment at the news that it would be so long. \n\n\nOh, Eddie.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Eddie barked, feeling his blush spread from his cheeks down to his neck. \n\n\nEddie gave an embarrassing squeak when Venom darted in front of his face and slipped their tongue into his mouth. Eddie gave a stuttering little moan, trying his best to return the symbiote \u2018kiss\u2019. \n\n\nVenom pulled their tongue back out before things got too out of control. They grinned wider at Eddie\u2019s red, embarrassed pout. \nWe knew you were perfect, Eddie, but you really are the most perfect human in the universe.\n\n\nEddie snorted, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly. Still, he couldn\u2019t help a small smile. \n\n\nThey settled back into the couch, Eddie wandering a hand up to scritch his fingers over the side of Venom\u2019s head. The symbiote purred happily. \n\n\nEddie.\n\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\n\nWhy is our throat itchy?\n\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m a little lactose intolerant.\u201d \n\n\nVenom heaved a sigh. \nHumans are useless. \n\n\n\u201cAaaand moment over.\u201d \n\n\nNext time we should just eat the whole cow.\n\n\n\u201cWhere would we even get a whole cow?\u201d \n\n\nIt\u2019s your planet, you tell us! \n\n\nEddie rolled his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll pay the butcher a visit, ok?\u201d \n\n\nVenom purred contentedly, nuzzling back in to rest their head in the crook of Eddie\u2019s neck. Yeah, this was definitely the perfect way to end the week. \n"
