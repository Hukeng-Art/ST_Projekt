    "text": "\u201cHoney! Where\u2019s my good tie?\u201d\nKara forces a smile on her face as she flips Mike\u2019s eggs, turning the burner off and reaching into the oven for the bacon. \u201cIt\u2019s in the closet, dear. Right next to your other ties.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not the one that puts the laundry away, am I?\u201d he calls down the stairs, and Kara sighs. Reminding him that all of his ties are in exactly the same place as they always have been after she painstakingly hand-washes them seems like a futile effort.\nBy the time Mike comes down to the kitchen dressed in his work attire, Kara has already plated up his breakfast. She gives it to him with a quick peck on the cheek, and immediately she starts on the dishes. She can eat her own shredded wheat once he\u2019s left for work.\nKara has a good life. She does. She has a nice house, and a husband who provides, and all she has to do is make herself look nice for him. She spends her days keeping their home clean and making sure dinner is on the table when Mike gets home at 5:45. There are people who have it much worse \u2013 like, the couple next door at their old house, the one they lived in just after their wedding. Her husband would drink, and shout, and sometimes she\u2019d have bruises covered up by powder. Mike isn\u2019t like that. He has a temper, sure, and he\u2019s insistent on her not updating her wardrobe, claiming that \u2018these modern trends are the downfall of decent society\u2019. He wouldn\u2019t even let her get new, smaller frames for her glasses.\nBut she doesn\u2019t mind.\nShe doesn\u2019t mind that she feels like she\u2019s stuck in a cycle, doing the same thing every day until she wants to scream. She doesn\u2019t mind that she\u2019s only 27 and she already feels like her life is over, her clothes constricting and her smile fake day in and day out. She doesn\u2019t mind that her husband won\u2019t stop bringing up the subject of having children, an idea that makes her feel so ill that she begged her doctor to give her those new contraceptive pills in secret. She keeps them under her side of the mattress, and dreads the day anyone finds out.\nIt\u2019s all just\u2026dandy.\nKara doesn\u2019t unwind until Mike has bustled out the door with his briefcase and lunch bag, and his noisy Cadillac has faded into the distance. Her shoulders relax, and she lets all of her breath out slowly until her lungs start to burn. As she inhales again, she happens to look up through the kitchen window, and she\u2019s surprised to see a large moving truck parked in the driveway next door.\nNew neighbors.\nIt seems like just yesterday that the house went up for sale. The price had been high \u2013 the house has a pool, after all, and it\u2019s almost twice the size of most of the other homes on the street \u2013 but clearly someone snatched it up immediately. The old family that lived there had been friendly enough, if uninteresting, and she wonders what the new people will be like.\nWell. Whoever the new neighbors are, she should be hospitable.\nKara busies herself for the morning making a chicken casserole, and the truck has left by the time she puts on her nicest dress and makes her way to the next house over. She can hear loud music coming from inside, something mellow and haunting with a female singer, and she adjusts her tight grip on the casserole dish as she knocks soundly on the door. The music quiets, and footsteps approach.\nThe act should have been an innocuous one. It\u2019s something Kara has done dozens of times for families moving into their suburb over the 5 years they\u2019ve lived here. But instead, she feels a sort of nervous anticipation. Like this is an important moment, and she has to pay attention. Like the very hair on her arms is standing up, waiting.\nThe woman who opens the door is nothing like Kara expected.\nShe\u2019s not a housewife. She\u2019s young, probably Kara\u2019s age, and alarmingly pretty. She\u2019s slightly shorter than Kara, especially so because she\u2019s in her bare feet. Kara can see that her toenails are painted, which shouldn\u2019t be an interesting fact but somehow seems fascinating. Her legs are completely bare, no stockings in sight, all the way up to the hem of her black slip dress. A leather belt cinches it to her waist, and the long sleeves drape a little bit as the woman leans against the doorframe.\nAnd, her face. She\u2019s stunning. Sharp features, pale skin, red lips, and dark, silky hair hanging loose around her shoulders. She\u2019s a stark contrast to Kara in her dress that she knows is a little outdated, with her thick glasses and stiff updo. This woman is glamorous. She looks loose, and carefree, and stylish. She looks like a catalog model. No\u2026even better. Those women don\u2019t have half the curves that she does, they don\u2019t have her subtle smile or her bright green eyes \u2013\nBright green eyes that are staring directly at Kara.\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d\nJumping almost high enough that she drops the glass dish in her hands, Kara hurriedly holds it out like a bomb that\u2019s about to go off. The tinfoil on top crinkles, and the woman looks at the gift with a quirked brow.\n\u201cHi there! I just wanted to say hello, and welcome to the neighborhood,\u201d Kara blurts, her heart pounding away for absolutely no reason.\nThe woman smiles, slow at first but turning out genuine, and thankfully she takes the dish from her hands. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026very sweet of you. I wasn\u2019t expecting a welcoming committee.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no committee!\u201d Kara chirps, pushing her glasses back up her nose. \u201cJust me.\u201d\nThe woman nods, her eyes glancing down to Kara\u2019s left hand. She doesn\u2019t seem surprised, but she seems slightly disappointed, somehow. \u201cMmm. Well, it\u2019s nice to meet you, Mrs\u2026\u201d she trails off, looking expectant.\n\u201cElis! Mrs. Mike Elis.\u201d\nLena laughs, and to Kara it sounds like wind chimes. Soft and beautiful. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for your husband\u2019s name.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\" Kara blushes. \"Right. It\u2019s\u2026Kara. I\u2019m Kara.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s lovely to meet you, Kara. I\u2019m Lena.\u201d Lena reaches out a hand, and Kara takes it in her own slightly sweaty one. Her grip is firm, and Kara notices that, for the first time, her own hand doesn\u2019t engulf the one she\u2019s shaking. She knows her hands are abnormally big for a woman, and Lena\u2019s seem to almost match.\nThe thought makes her confusingly warm.\nWhen their hands part there\u2019s a moment of silence that Kara can see growing slightly awkward, so she forges forward with the first conversation topic she can think of.\n\u201cSo! Is your husband at home? Maybe once you\u2019re all settled in, we could get together. We could, um. Do fondue, or \u2013\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019m not married.\u201d\nKara blinks owlishly at that. It\u2019s a little bit astonishing that a woman as beautiful as Lena hasn\u2019t been snatched up. The only other person their age that Kara knows of who isn\u2019t married is Alex, who is too busy trying to be the first female FBI agent in the state to focus on romance. Or so she tells Kara, at least. Her sister has been acting so secretive lately that Kara almost thinks she must have a secret beau.\n\u201cOh! Gosh, I\u2019m sorry for assuming. I just thought -\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\" Lena says with a kind smile. \"I realize it\u2019s a rarity.\u201d\nKara feels a bit put out, if she\u2019s being honest. If Lena had a husband, Kara would have a comfortable excuse to get to know her better. As it is, she\u2019s not sure Lena will want to spend her time with a boring, married homemaker.\nLena seems to sense her mood shift, because she puts the casserole down on a table next to the door and crosses her arms. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m having a little shindig to get to know everyone in the neighborhood this weekend. A bit of a party. You and your husband should stop by.\u201d\n\u201cOh! Really?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Lena chuckles, tucking a bit of hair behind her ear. The movement makes her sleeve fall back, and Kara catches sight of a small tattoo on her wrist \u2013 three circles, all touching, each one smaller than the last. It\u2019s foreign and shocking, but she can\u2019t seem to take her eyes away from it.\nShe\u2019s never seen a woman with a tattoo before. Except maybe Janis Joplin. Dazedly, she wonders if the inked skin feels any different than the rest. The thought is as fascinating as it is alarming.\nLena\u2019s voice brings her out of her strange, confusing thoughts.\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ll see you there?\u201d Lena looks genuinely hopeful, and Kara nods quickly, suddenly desperate for some distance between them.\n\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Kara trills, already backing away and down the front steps. \u201cSounds swell, we\u2019ll see you then, great to meet you, bye!\u201d\nOnly when she\u2019s in the safety of her own kitchen does she sink into a chair, putting a trembling hand to her chest where her heart beats wildly under the stiff fabric.\nWhen she enters Lena\u2019s house for the first time three days later, on Mike\u2019s arm and dressed in her Sunday best, the party is a bit different than she expected.\nThe lights are dim, and the house is packed. It seems like the entire suburb is here, drinking and eating h\u2019ors d\u2019oeuvres \u2013 including, it seems, the more colourful people that she\u2019s never really socialized with. They seem to be causing some sort of ruckus in Lena\u2019s pool, kissing and being rowdy, and Mike scoffs in distaste.\n\u201cLooks like the swingers are here. This Lena woman should be more careful with who she invites.\u201d\nKara tsks, tugging his arm. \u201cBe nice, Michael. She\u2019s just trying to get to know everyone. How was she supposed to know?\u201d\nLena herself is nowhere to be found. Kara gets a beer for Mike and a glass of club soda for herself, scanning the crowd for her \u2013 not that Kara is overly interested in her whereabouts. She\u2019s just wondering where the hostess is, at her own party.\nWhen Mike gets pulled into a conversation about the rudeness of the pool crowd with the family across the street, Kara decides to look for her herself.\nShe excuses herself quietly, citing a need for the bathroom, and ducks into the hallway. It\u2019s much quieter here, the loud music and lights less pervasive, and she takes a calming breath. There are a lot of doors here, and she doesn\u2019t want to just barge in. She\u2019s just considering knocking on the nearest one when it spills open, and the object of her fascination stumbles out with another woman in tow \u2013 Lucy, the young newlywed woman from down the street. The one with the tiny dog that yips every time anyone walks past.\nHer husband James is in the pool, Kara notes with distant concern.\nLucy is giggling, twisting her hair up into a bun, and Lena has a light pink lipstick mark on the underside of her jaw that Kara isn\u2019t entirely sure how to process. What could they have been doing? Making each other\u2019s faces over, maybe? They certainly seem happy, and physically close. Lucy leans against Lena in a way that Kara can\u2019t help but imagine doing herself.\nShe almost feels like she\u2019s intruding, but when Lena\u2019s eyes fall on her, her face brightens considerably.\n\u201cKara! You came!\u201d Lena says, and the brilliant smile she trains on Kara sears itself into her memory.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not the only one,\u201d Lucy mutters, grinning when Lena huffs and smacks her on the shoulder.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be crass.\u201d\nLucy just shrugs, and kisses Lena on the cheek. \u201cFind me later, if you want.\u201d\n\nThat must be how she got the lipstick print. They must be really close friends already.\n\nLucy leaves with a wink at Kara, and Kara smiles uneasily back.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about her,\u201d Lena says, looking truly apologetic, and Kara waves it off.\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be silly. She seemed nice.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s certainly...enthusiastic.\u201d Lena fiddles with her hair, which is a little messy in the back. \u201cAnyways, how are you? I wasn\u2019t sure you were going to turn up, with the way you ran away when I invited you.\u201d\n\u201cOh! Right. I\u2019m sorry about that, I just \u2013 I remembered that I had a cake in the oven, and I didn\u2019t want it to overbake, you know? Dry cake. Mike hates dry cake.\u201d\n\u201cMike? That\u2019s your husband, right?\u201d\nKara nods in confirmation, and Lena sidesteps her like she\u2019s expecting Kara to lead her to Mike for an introduction - but suddenly the idea of introducing Lena to her husband sounds like the absolute worst thing in the world. She wants to keep Lena to herself. Her own private friend, one thing that Mike can\u2019t influence. In a panic she grabs Lena\u2019s arm, but lets go immediately when she hears Lena\u2019s breath catch.\n\u201cSorry!\u201d she blurts, clasping her hands behind her back. \u201cI just \u2013 I thought maybe we could talk some more, just the two of us.\u201d\nLena nods, accepting that immediately, and it\u2019s refreshing to not have to fight about it. Lena just smiles, and offers to go get them some drinks. But of course, as soon as Lena disappears around the corner, Kara's husband seems to take her place. When he spots Kara he sighs, his jaw flexing, and takes her arm in a firm grip.\n\u201cThose people are embarrassing themselves,\u201d he says, clearly irritated. \u201cWe\u2019re going home.\u201d\n\u201cBut, I \u2013 I need to say goodbye \u2013\u201c Kara protests, but his grip is firm.\n\u201cNow, Kara.\u201d\nKara follows him out, putting on her coat slowly, and just before they exit she looks back and sees Lena. She\u2019s standing in the foyer, a glass of wine in each hand; she raises one of them to Kara with a small, sad-looking smile, and Kara has just enough time to wave back before Mike closes the door behind them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKara tries to stay away. She really does. She spends three days glancing almost obsessively out her kitchen window, hoping for a glimpse at her elusive neighbor. But she can\u2019t see over the fence from downstairs, and Lena doesn\u2019t seem to go out the front door very much. But going over, in the middle of the day, when she should be doing the laundry, just seems absurd.\nNevertheless, she\u2019s at Lena\u2019s front door within the hour.\nLena opens it with a smile on her face, the same one she\u2019d trained on Kara at the party. The one that shows her white teeth, makes her eyes crinkle at the corners. She\u2019s wearing pants, today, in a shade of dark red, and a silk shirt.\n\u201cHey there, neighbor. I was wondering if I\u2019d see you again.\u201d\nKara\u2019s face heats up, and she smooths her hand over her starched skirt, feeling just as frumpy as usual next to Lena. \u201cRight. I\u2019m sorry, about the other night. Mike wanted to go home, and \u2013\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I understand,\u201d Lena interrupts, moving aside and gesturing. \u201cCome on in, I\u2019ll grab us a drink.\u201d\nLena\u2019s house looks different, when it\u2019s not littered with empty beer cans and pulsing under disco lights. It\u2019s tidy, and it\u2019s overwhelmingly white \u2013 starkly so, from the walls to the carpets. Kara wonders how on earth she keeps it clean.\n\u201cWhat can I get you? Coffee, tea, wine, beer? I have some scotch in the cabinet, or vodka if you want a mix \u2013\u201c Lena is opening the cupboards already, revealing a truly startling array of liquors next to the glasses.\n\u201cOh, gosh, tea is fine!\u201d Kara assures her, smoothing her hair nervously. She went with a more natural look today, a knot at the base of her neck instead of her usual coif \u2013 Mike had looked at her strangely this morning, but it feels better, more natural, and she foolishly hopes that Lena will notice.\n\u201cAre you sure? I can put a nip of whiskey in it,\u201d Lena offers, grinning in a way that lets Kara know it\u2019s okay to refuse. Kara shakes her head, and Lena turns on the kettle with a wink.\u00a0\n\u201cSo,\u201d Lena says when they\u2019re finally seated at the island, mugs of non-alcoholic tea steaming in front of them. \u201cWhat brings you to my door? I got the idea your husband didn\u2019t like my party, much.\u201d\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s just\u2026he was just tired,\u201d Kara says, and even she knows that she\u2019s not entirely convincing. Lena quirks an eyebrow, tapping her fingers on the countertop.\n\u201cRight.\u201d\nKara takes of her glasses, rubbing at her eyes and then putting them back on, and she\u2019s startled to see Lena watching her with an intense expression.\n\u201cLena?\u201d\nLena shakes her head, taking a sip of her tea. \u201cSorry. I was just wondering.\u201d\n\u201cWondering what?\u201d Kara asks, her stomach suddenly in knots. Lena\u2019s curiosity is strange and new, and she\u2019s not entirely sure how to react.\n\u201cYou seem\u2026I don\u2019t know. Different than anyone else I've met.\u201d\nKara\u2019s stomach sinks. She looks down at her clothes, the floral print on her dress, at her clunky shoes. She feels doubly self-conscious of them now.\n\u201cOh. I know, I feel like an old lady next to you,\u201d she says, trying to sound light and airy. \u201cYou look like you walked out of Vogue magazine.\u201d\nLena frowns, jostling her tea in her hurry to put a reassuring hand over Kara\u2019s. \u201cOh, no! God, not that. That\u2019s not what I \u2013 do you not like your clothes?\u201d\nKara shrugs. \u201cMy husband prefers them. I\u2019ve never really felt comfortable in my skin anyways, so why fight?\u201d\nUnderstanding dawns on Lena\u2019s face, and Kara somehow feels embarrassed by it. She takes an overly large gulp of tea, hissing when it burns her tongue.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kara,\u201d Lena finally says, when Kara\u2019s eyes have stopped watering from the hot drink. \u201cI thought you just liked to dress that way. I didn\u2019t really think about it.\u201d\n\nOh.\n\nLena didn\u2019t really think about it. She didn\u2019t think that Kara was unfashionable. The idea seems ridiculous, but Lena looks so genuine that Kara almost believes her.\n\u201cWell then, what did you mean by \u2018different\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cI mean\u2026\u201d Lena\u2019s brow furrows, like she\u2019s trying to solve a complicated riddle. \u201cI met a lot of the people in this suburb last weekend. And they\u2019re all\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBoring?\u201d Kara supplies, and Lena laughs, loud and surprised.\n\u201cYes, actually. I was trying to be diplomatic, but I\u2019m glad you agree.\u201d\nMaking Lena laugh, even for those few seconds, somehow becomes one of the proudest moments of Kara\u2019s life. She wants to do it more. She feels hungry for Lena\u2019s attention in a way she isn\u2019t used to, and it\u2019s unnerving to say the least.\n\u201cMy husband socializes with them, but I don\u2019t have much to say, besides recipe swapping,\u201d Kara says, and Lena smiles at her fondly.\n\u201cSee, you\u2019re not like them. That\u2019s what I mean \u2013 you\u2019re interesting. What are you doing here?\u201d Lena asks, completely sincere.\nKara blushes properly, now. She feels like she\u2019s under a spotlight, and it\u2019s one she doesn\u2019t quite deserve. Lena thinks she\u2019s interesting. Lena.\nSuddenly, she\u2019s terrified of the day that Lena discovers that she isn\u2019t.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Kara stammers, hiding her anxiety in her mug. She didn\u2019t notice earlier because it was searing her mouth, but the tea is some sort of fruity herbal blend, and it\u2019s delicious and soothing.\nLena continues, as if Kara isn\u2019t having a small crisis. \u201cWell, what about your husband? How did that happen?\u201d\nIt\u2019s an interesting way to phrase \u2018how did you meet\u2019. Almost harsh. But Kara shrugs, taking another sip of tea.\n\u201cHe asked me to go steady when we were in school, and when we graduated, he proposed. He wanted me to stay home, and\u2026I did.\u201d Now that she\u2019s saying it out loud, the honest truth, it seems silly. Here\u2019s Lena, who lives on her own, who throws parties without a husband, who provides for herself, and Kara isn\u2019t even allowed to drive her own car anywhere but to the grocery store because she settled down with the first man who asked her. It had just seemed like the thing to do, at the time. She feels the same way around Alex, sometimes, but never this intensely. She feels like she needs to prove herself to Lena, somehow.\n\u201cHe wants you to do a lot of things, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Lena says quietly, and Kara swallows.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not so bad.\u201d Kara picks at the string of the teabag until it splits into tiny strands, and Lena seems understanding.\n\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s talk about other things, hm?\u201d\nLena, as it turns out, is a freelance photographer. Kara has no idea how she affords this house by herself with that career, but Lena will only wave vaguely and say \u2018family money\u2019 when she asks, and Kara accepts it without too much thought. She seems to know so many things about the world, about experiences that Kara can\u2019t even imagine. She\u2019s adopted, Kara learns, and her family has some patents on newfangled inventions, but Lena doesn\u2019t go into detail, and Kara doesn\u2019t pry.\nAs a product of her work, her house is covered in framed photographs. They vary from beautiful shots of landscapes to human subjects, all taken by her camera, but the photographs of people interest Kara the most. They\u2019re all taken from afar, rather than close-up. She seems to prefer happy people \u2013 couples, people with their dogs, children playing, friends embracing \u2013 but there\u2019s a sadness to the way she frames them. They\u2019re distant. Untouchable. They betray a sort of longing that Kara can\u2019t explain, and it makes her want to give Lena a hug.\nIt\u2019s not long before Kara is visiting next door almost every day, making up excuses to knock on her door until Lena finally tells her she\u2019s welcome to come socialize anytime, and she gets to know Lena a little bit more with every visit.\nThey\u2019re becoming friends. It\u2019s what Kara hoped for from the moment they met, but it still doesn\u2019t seem like quite enough.\nIt\u2019s a steady climb, days of short and long visits (depending on Kara\u2019s chore list) and working on making her new friend laugh as much as possible. Lena introduces her to new things, from champagne and orange juice to a talented musician named Jimi Hendrix, and Kara marvels at all the things she had no idea existed.\nOne such new thing is revealed on an innocuous Thursday, when Kara bustles through Lena\u2019s front door without knocking (as Lena instructed her to do weeks ago) to see Lena at her kitchen island, surrounded by little white papers and what looks like oregano. She\u2019s rolling one of the papers into a cylinder, and when she looks up Kara can see dark circles under her eyes. Her smile is genuine, even if it doesn\u2019t quite light her face up like usual.\n\u201cMorning. Want to share?\u201d\nLena holds something out to her \u2013 it looks like a short, scrunched-up cigarette. The combination of things finally sparks Kara\u2019s brain, and she gasps.\n\u201cWhat do you \u2013 oh my goodness, Lena, is that marijuana?\u201d Kara hisses, looking nervously over her shoulder as if the police are going to knock the door down at any moment. \u201cThat\u2019s illegal!\u201d\n\u201cLots of things are illegal, Kara,\u201d Lena says, and the moment feels a bit heavy suddenly. Like Lena was reminded of something she\u2019d rather forget. She starts to sweep the rest of the cannabis into a baggie, tying it up and putting it into a jar on the counter. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t usually indulge either, but I had a rough night, and I\u2019m going to get blazed.\u201d\n\u201cA rough night?\u201d Kara asks, as Lena moves herself to the plush couch and flicks a lighter. The tip of the paper glows, and Lena take a deep pull on it, holding the smoke in her lungs for a few seconds before exhaling it all in a strange-smelling cloud.\n\u201cMy mother called.\u201d\nLena has only mentioned her mother in passing, but from what Kara knows, their relationship is antagonistic at best. The money Lena lives on came from her father, and her mother doesn\u2019t want her to have it, for whatever reason. She can imagine that their phone conversation was less than pleasant.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lena.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright. This is helping. And, I\u2019m glad you came to see me today.\u201d Lena seems much more relaxed already, as she takes her second pull. The smell is odd, but not horrible like cigarette smoke, and Lena doesn\u2019t seem to be acting wild or crazy. She\u2019s just sitting with her head lolled back on the headrest of the couch, humming quietly to herself. The movement of her lips around the paper, the way she holds the smoke before breathing it out in an elegant sort of stream, is strangely mesmerizing.\nKara has always associated drugs with hard partiers or beatniks, but Lena is\u2026well, she\u2019s Lena.\nLena hasn\u2019t steered her wrong yet, right?\n\u201cI want to try.\u201d\nLena cracks an eye open.\u00a0\u201cYou do?\u201d\n\u201cI do. It seems pretty harmless, right?\nLena smiles, looking surprised and delighted. \u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to, right? I\u2019m okay by myself.\u201d\n\u201cI know. But\u2026I want to try new things.\u201d\nLena regards her for a moment, her eyes narrowed, and Kara gets the feeling she's being carefully considered. But finally Lena hands the smoldering thing over to her, and Kara raises it to her mouth. It seems silly, but the part that Lena touched to her lips \u2013 already stained with red lipstick \u2013 seems warmer than the rest.\n\u201cTake a small toke, at first. It\u2019s probably going to make you cough, but you\u2019ll get used to that.\u201d\nKara nods, putting it to her lips.\nIt does, in fact, make her cough. The smoke is a little bit acrid, but it isn\u2019t horrible, and when she hands the joint back to Lena she feels accomplished. She did it, and she didn\u2019t embarrass herself.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel any different,\u201d Kara says, her voice a little rough. Her eyes are watering from the coughing, and Lena laughs, taking another draw herself.\n\u201cIt takes a minute.\u201d\nA few minutes and a few lungfuls later, Kara definitely feels different.\nHer skin feels strange, slightly more sensitive than usual, and everything is just a little bit brighter. She can\u2019t seem to control the things that come out of her mouth, and her anxiety \u2013 which is always present, in some way, in every facet of her life \u2013 is completely gone. The world is just swell, and Lena is lying with her head in Kara\u2019s lap, smiling up at her.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty. Did you know that?\u201d\nKara blushes hard, sputtering. \u201cNo, I mean, I \u2013 I\u2019m not \u2013 I mean, compared to you \u2013\u201c\n\u201cNo, you are. Really.\u201d Lena reaches up and slides Kara\u2019s glasses off her face, folding them and putting them on the arm of the couch. She touches her finger to Kara\u2019s nose, and the tiny boop feels like the funniest thing that\u2019s ever happened in her life. They both giggle, and the blurriness caused by her lack of spectacles makes the whole situation feel even more floaty.\nShe feels floaty in a different way when Lena intertwines their hands, running her fingertips over the pads of Kara\u2019s palm until it tingles.\nThe part of her brain that usually stops her from doing stupid things seems to be turned off, so Kara gives in to her immediate impulse to touch Lena\u2019s hair in exchange. She cards her free fingers through it, the silky strands tickling her skin, and giggles.\n\u201cYou have nice hair. So soft. How do you get it so soft? Mine is never soft.\u201d\n\u201cYou use hairspray.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d Lena makes a little pop with her mouth on the word, and they both dissolve into giggles at it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this relaxed,\u201d Kara sighs, and Lena hums her agreement.\n\u201cBeing high does that to you.\u201d\n\u201cDo you do this all the time?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not often,\u201d Lena answers, her fingers still tracing patterns over Kara\u2019s. She follows the lines of Kara\u2019s palm, and then draws a loopy heart. \u201cJust sometimes. I find it too easy to get addicted to things.\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\nLena doesn\u2019t answer. Kara keeps stroking her hair, feeling like it\u2019s the only thing keeping her grounded. She scratches her nails over Lena\u2019s scalp and Lena makes a tiny noise, one that Kara has never heard before \u2013 it\u2019s high, and throaty, and it gets cut off before she can examine it further by Lena clearing her throat.\nIt sticks in her mind, that little one-second soundbite. She wants to recreate it, make it longer, louder. She\u2019s full of a desire she doesn\u2019t understand. Suddenly things are a little overwhelming, and Kara glances up at the clock above Lena\u2019s fridge to see that it reads 3:45.\n\u201cShoot!\u201d Kara hisses, springing up and dislodging Lena from her lap. \u201cShoot, darn, shoot, I should have been home hours ago \u2013 I have to make dinner \u2013\u201c\nLena frowns up at her, her hair ruffled. She looks like she doesn\u2019t quite understand what\u2019s happened. Kara grabs her glasses and shoves them crookedly on her face, hurrying to the door.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lena, but Mike will be so upset if he gets home with no supper \u2013\u201c\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Lena calls after her, looking a little bit lost, and it takes an unnerving amount of willpower not to abandon the whole thing and just let Mike be angry if it means spending more time with her. But she\u2019s hit suddenly with a memory of the fight they had the last time she didn\u2019t have dinner on the table because she fell asleep listening to the radio, of the way Mike treated her afterwards, and the anxiety returns even through the fog.\nMaking dinner turns out to be twice the chore it usually is. She finds herself forgetting parts of the recipe that she knows by heart, for some reason, and often she catches herself zoning out and almost burning something because she\u2019s staring out the window at Lena\u2019s front door, remembering the softness of her hair and the sound of her laugh.\nThankfully, her husband doesn\u2019t notice. He comments on the redness of her eyes, but Kara just tells him that she was chopping onions.\nThe fact that there are no onions in the dish seems to be lost on him.\nShe makes it all the way to bedtime without serious incident. The rest of her day feels empty without Lena but she gets through it, tidying up the house and finishing dinner and cleaning the dishes. She even manages to go a few minutes without thinking about her. At least until Mike has gotten into bed and she\u2019s at her vanity combing the tight style out of her hair, and she sees movement in Lena\u2019s yard.\nWorried for a moment that it might be an intruder, Kara moves to the window for a closer look. But it\u2019s just Lena, standing by the pool. She\u2019s lit by the underwater lights, flickering and strange, and she seems to be taking off her layers. Except she isn\u2019t in a bathing suit, she\u2019s just \u2013 in her undergarments \u2013\nAnd then Lena is in nothing, absolutely nothing, she\u2019s naked, and Kara\u2019s brush is suspended in the air and her mouth is hanging open and something is happening between her legs as she watches Lena, naked as the day she was born, dive into the pool.\nLena stays underwater for an almost worrying amount of time, her pale form swimming smoothly from one end to the other, until finally she surfaces and slicks her hair back. She treads water for a second, and then floats onto her back and kicks her legs lazily to keep afloat.\nKara is gobsmacked. Soon enough she\u2019s standing so close to the window that her breath fogs the glass, just staring, trying to make out the details \u2013 she can just see the outlines of Lena\u2019s breasts floating on the surface, the fan of her dark hair around her head and then a smaller dark patch lower, between \u2013 oh, gosh, between \u2013\nAnd then, Lena\u2019s feet find the bottom of the shallow end. She stands, tilts her head, and mortifyingly, she waves. Directly at Kara. There\u2019s nothing else she could be waving at, besides Kara\u2019s bedroom window and Kara herself in it, probably silhouetted by the bedside lamp.\nKara has never felt such abject humiliation in her life. She was staring blatantly at her neighbor, naked, in her own pool, and she got caught. She squeaks in a very unladylike way, and ducks below the windowsill with a racing heart. She wants to pop her head back up to check if Lena is still watching, but all she can do is crawl until she\u2019s out of the window\u2019s line of sight and get into bed, her stomach in knots.\nWhy did she do that? And why couldn\u2019t she take her eyes away?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe doesn\u2019t visit Lena the next day. When she wakes in the morning it all seems a bit embarrassing, the way she acted, and she\u2019s not sure she should humiliate herself further. Instead she goes grocery shopping, feeling on-edge the whole time as if she\u2019s expecting Lena to jump out from behind the milk fridge in one of her hip designer outfits.\nTo say it\u2019s a shock to answer her front door a week later to Lena Luthor in a scarlet romper with a zipper that\u2019s open almost to her pelvis is a vast understatement.\n\u201cLena!\u201d Kara manages to gasp, swiping at a stray piece of hair that\u2019s fallen out of her style. There are still suds on her hands from the dishes, and she can feel them wet on her forehead. \u201cWhat \u2013 what are you \u2013\u201c Kara can see a small mole just to the right of Lena\u2019s bellybutton, and something about it is absolutely fascinating.\n\u201cI missed you,\u201d Lena shrugs, as if she isn\u2019t standing on Kara\u2019s stoop with most of her torso revealed.\nKara feels a little guilty at that. She hasn\u2019t visited at all since the day got high with Lena \u2013 she\u2019s picked the phone up more than once with the intent of calling, but she hasn\u2019t been able to convince herself to dial the number. She\u2019s been struggling to clear that strange night at the window from her head, and the idea of seeing Lena up close, talking to her, filled her with unexplainable dread.\nIt\u2019s just because she was caught being nosy, she told herself. She\u2019s embarrassed at being a peeping tom. That\u2019s all.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t visited, I\u2019ve just been \u2013\u201c\n\u201cBusy. I know,\u201d Lena says, and a cloud passes briefly over her face. It\u2019s fleeting, but Kara catches it, and it hits her deep.\nShe never wants to see Lena sad. Especially not because of her. She\u2019s just being silly with this whole thing.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lena,\u201d Kara says sincerely, trying her best to relax. \u201cI really am. I\u2019ve been a bad friend.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. The phone works two ways.\u201d Lena tries to wave her off, but Kara opens the door wider.\n\u201cYou should come inside. I\u2019ll make us a drink, for once.\u201d\nLena steps inside, her heels clicking on the linoleum. The linoleum of Kara\u2019s house. She\u2019s in Kara\u2019s house.\nSomething about it, about glamorous Lena standing in her plain kitchen, the space where she\u2019s usually so miserable, makes her feel hot and cold all over.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019ve been friends all this time and I\u2019ve never been here,\u201d Lena says, her eyes sweeping the space. She looks around at the speckled countertops, the kitchen table, the window that faces her own driveway, something sharp and appraising in her gaze, and Kara clears her throat.\n\u201cWould you, um. Would you like a tour?\u201d\nShe guides Lena through the sitting room, the hallways, the guest room, and finally, she eases open the door to her own bedroom.\n\u201cYou know, we don\u2019t have to look in here. It\u2019s just a bedroom, just a normal \u2013\u201c but Lena is already inside, looking around with interest. She runs a hand over the foot of the bed as she glides past, the pristine folding of the duvet wrinkling in a line under her fingers, and she shoots Kara a mischievous grin as she takes in the decor.\nThe look, in combination with Lena being in her bedroom, makes Kara feel antsy.\nFinally Lena comes to the closet, still open a crack after Kara\u2019s dressing this morning. Carefully she widens the crack, thumbing past drab skirt after drab skirt, stiff dresses and shirts and starchy fabric.\n\u201cDo you really only dress this way because your husband likes it?\u201d She asks, pulling at a particularly dull print.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like modern style.\u201d\nLena lets the skirt fall back into line, turning on her heel and regarding Kara carefully. Kara tries very, very hard not to be rude and stare at the bare skin of her stomach.\n\u201cAll right, come on. We\u2019re going shopping.\u201d\nKara isn\u2019t sure how, but despite her vehement protests she\u2019s in Lena\u2019s convertible and en route to the mall within 5 minutes.\nThe store they end up at is both completely unfamiliar to her and deeply out of her price range. The mannequins are dressed in bright colours, a far cry from her own yellows and browns, and Lena seems right at home, but Kara feels out of place in comparison. Frumpy, and boring.\n\u201cLena, I can\u2019t possibly afford anything here,\u201d she whispers, feeling like very eye in the store is on her. But Lena doesn\u2019t seem to care. She just grabs Kara\u2019s hand, pulling her into the men\u2019s section.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, you\u2019re not paying.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Kara gasps, the price tags she\u2019s seen so far seeming absolutely sky-high for a gift. \u201cNo, gosh, I couldn\u2019t possibly \u2013 what are we doing looking at men\u2019s pants?\u201c\nLena rolls her eyes affectionately, grabbing a pair of corduroys in deep blue and a light blue shirt. \u201cKara. Let me do this for you.\u201d\nLena paces the aisles, grabbing at pieces until her arms are full, and then gestures for an employee to get them a private changing room. Inside there\u2019s a large mirror, a bench, and a folding privacy fan. Pushing Kara behind the fan with her armful of clothes, Lena takes a seat on the bench to wait with an encouraging nod.\nThe clothes that Lena gave her seem to be all over the map. There\u2019s a few skirts, a dress or two, and a lot of pants, along with two men\u2019s shirts \u2013 one polo and another a button-down. She\u2019s not sure why Lena is having her try on men\u2019s clothes, but she shrugs. It\u2019s a day out of the house, and it could be fun, just for a day.\nShe tries on the dresses and skirts first. They feel better than her own clothes, but they still give her the feeling she\u2019s always had \u2013 that something isn\u2019t quite right, isn\u2019t quite fitting. She no longer feels frumpy, but she still feels a bit uncomfortable, somehow. Lena nods her approval of both looks, and finally Kara picks up the corduroys.\n\u201cI\u2019m still not sure why you got things from the men\u2019s section,\u201d she calls over the privacy fan. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019ll fit me \u2013\u201c\nKara says it just as she\u2019s pulling the pants over her hips, and to her shock, they fasten in a perfect fit. They\u2019re even roomy enough for her legs, which she\u2019s always felt were too long and muscular. They fit every contour of her narrow hips effortlessly.\n\u201cJust trust me on this. I have an instinct,\u201d Lena calls back, and as Kara looks down properly at the shape of her own legs for what feels like the first time, she thinks that maybe what Lena has is a superpower.\nShe chooses the button-down, a light blue to match the dark blue of the pants, and tucks it into the waistband with a growing sense of excitement. Maybe she looks ridiculous \u2013 but the clothes are actually comfortable, and something in her wants to see Lena\u2019s reaction.\nLena\u2019s eyes widen the second she emerges. They go dark, raking over Kara\u2019s body in a way that gives her goosebumps, and Kara holds her arms out and does a little spin.\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Kara asks breathlessly. She\u2019s not quite prepared to turn and look in the mirror yet, not quite ready to face what she might look like, but Lena\u2019s face is telling her that she\u2019s doing something right.\nAfter a few seconds of staring, taking in the outfit silently, Lena licks her lips, swallows, and comes forward. Slowly she eases the top three buttons of Kara\u2019s shirt open, almost revealing her brassiere. Her fingers momentarily brush Kara\u2019s sternum, and she twitches with some kind of strange energy.\nNext she takes Kara\u2019s glasses off, making her blink. Her prescription isn\u2019t very strong, so Lena\u2019s face is still clear, but it still feels strange when she usually only takes them off before bed. After Kara\u2019s eyes have adjusted, Lena reaches back into Kara\u2019s hair. Their faces are inches apart, and Kara is almost tempted to close her eyes \u2013 but she just grasps the pins holding Kara\u2019s hair up and pulls them out. Kara\u2019s dull blonde waves spill down, and Lena runs her fingers through them until the hairspray releases its hold.\nLena\u2019s nails scratch at Kara\u2019s scalp, just like Kara\u2019s did on hers that day on the couch, and she feels like she\u2019s going to melt into the linoleum. And, finally, Lena takes a thumb and drags it slowly over Kara\u2019s lower lip, wiping off most of her lipstick.\nIt\u2019s the single strangest and most exciting moment of Kara\u2019s life, and she can\u2019t for the life of her articulate why.\n\u201cThere,\u201d Lena whispers, her voice cracking slightly. \u201cNot so buttoned-up now, are you?\u201d\nWith Lena\u2019s guidance Kara finally turns around, and a different person is staring back at her from the mirror.\nJust like she thought, the pants fit her almost too well. They cling to every curve, and she\u2019s never felt so exposed and yet so comfortable. And the shirt is the same \u2013 the colour makes her eyes seem brighter, and it feels tight on her arms and shoulders in a way that\u2019s strangely satisfying.\nShe has to squint in order to see the details, but the facial expression actually ends up adding to the overall impact. She looks\u2026confident. Powerful. She looks sexy. Lena\u2019s head pokes up from behind her shoulder, and her hands land on Kara\u2019s waist, feeling so different without her usual skirt. Her hands feel as hot as an iron, and Kara is suddenly very aware of the fact that there\u2019s now only one layer of fabric between that bare stretch of skin revealed by Lena\u2019s outfit and her own back.\nShe\u2019s covered in goosebumps, and it\u2019s not just from the outfit.\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Lena asks quietly.\n\u201cI think\u2026\u201d What Kara thinks, deep down, is that this might be the first time she\u2019s ever felt truly herself in her entire life.\n\u201cI think the neighbors might talk.\u201d\nLena laughs, and buys her the outfit anyways. It goes in a box at the bottom of her closet, but every few days she takes it out while Mike is at work, and just looks at herself in their bathroom mirror with her hair down. Every time she does, she feels like a snake shedding its old skin. Something new and raw underneath, but infinitely better.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSomething Kara doesn\u2019t ever expect when she goes to Lena\u2019s house is two sets of voices. Lena seems to have almost no visitors besides herself, so when she opens Lena\u2019s door on an innocuous Tuesday and hears a very loud, very male laugh booming along with Lena\u2019s, she almost turns right around in shock.\nBefore she can decide what to do, she hears Lena call out.\n\u201cKara? Is that you?\u201d\n\nShoot.\n\nClearly Lena heard the door open, and Kara has no choice but to make her way back to the pool where Lena is sitting with a sangria in her hand.\nIn a bikini. Where Lena is sitting in a bikini with a sangria in her hand. In a bikini.\nShe\u2019s wearing a floor-length flowy sarong over it, but Kara can still see so much bare skin, the paleness of it almost glowing in the brightness even though she\u2019s sitting under an umbrella. It brings her uncomfortably close to how she felt the night she saw Lena swimming naked, and it takes a mammoth effort to pull her eyes away from Lena\u2019s soft stomach and pay attention to the person sitting beside her.\nHer friend is in tiny red swim trunks, his chest shiny and oiled. Clearly, he\u2019s enjoying the sun, even while Lena hides in the shade. They\u2019re laughing together about something, and Kara has the bewildering urge to leave again at how joyful and easy Lena seems in his presence.\nBut Lena spots her first, and she looks so happy as she waves her over that Kara shoves the confusing thoughts down.\n\u201cKara, this is Jack Spheer. One of my oldest friends.\u201d\nJack holds a hand out, and when Kara takes it he pulls it to his mouth to give her knuckles a dramatic kiss.\n\u201cCharmed,\u201d he says with a wink, and the relief she feels at learning they\u2019re just pals gets shoved down on top of all the other emotions. Including a brief irritation at how Lena tops up his drink without asking and laughs at all his jokes. Even if he actually is very funny.\nAnnoyingly funny.\nJack is suave, and British, and Kara feels something hot and twisting in her gut at the affectionate way he interacts with Lena. It\u2019s an ease she wishes she could have, but her stupid weird feelings keep getting in the way. She wants to interrupt. She wants to push Jack into the pool. But then Lena would probably just go in after him, and they\u2019d probably kiss or something \u2013\n\u201cAnd then I told him, if you want to kiss me, at least have a cigarette or something because you smell like cheap booze and I have no interest in experiencing it through your mouth \u2013\u201c Jack is saying to a giggling Lena, and Kara\u2019s brain scratches like a broken record.\n\u201cWait, he?\u201d\nJack blinks, looking back and forth between Kara and Lena. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cYou kiss men?\u201d Kara asks, feeling like she\u2019s the slowest horse at the race, but she\u2019s just so stunned.\n\u201cAlmost exclusively, babe,\u201d Jack winks again, and his confidence at the admission is almost as shocking as the admission itself. Lena looks nervous, like she\u2019s expecting some kind of reaction, and Kara schools her features to conceal the strange somersaults her brain is doing right now.\nJack kisses men. Assumedly, Jack has sex with men. He and Lena aren\u2019t together. She\u2019s confused, but mostly, she\u2019s just relieved.\nJack laughs, looking at Kara like she\u2019s a precocious child. \u201cOh, look at how shocked she is, bless her! Lena, have you not told her that you \u2013\u201c\n\u201cJack!\u201d Lena snaps harshly, and Kara jumps at the loudness of it. She\u2019s never seen Lena look this serious, this angry \u2013 her jaw is clenched, and her knuckles are white around her glass. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a few beats of silence, where Kara can feel the awkwardness in the air like a mist. She wonders if they\u2019re about to have a fight, and if perhaps she should leave. But Jack puts his hands up, looking instantly sober and genuinely apologetic.\n\u201cSorry, love. Didn\u2019t think. No more wine for me, hm?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Kara asks, looking between them. Some sort of secret has passed between them, and she feels stupid for not knowing what it is. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nBut Lena shakes her head with a smile that looks forced.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Kara. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nKara leaves that day feeling out of sorts, like she missed a step going down the stairs, and that night she has a strange dream.\nShe\u2019s in Lena\u2019s pool. She\u2019s alone, at first, but then there\u2019s someone behind her \u2013 someone hovering close. And then two hands land on her hips, just like that day in the changing room, and somehow she knows without even looking that it\u2019s Lena.\nLena is behind her, and slowly she becomes aware of the fact that she\u2019s naked.\nIt doesn\u2019t feel the way it normally does. Usually when she\u2019s naked she\u2019s either getting dressed or she\u2019s in bed with her husband, neither of which are overwhelmingly positive experiences \u2013 but she feels calm, floaty. Almost like she did that day that Lena got her high. Lena\u2019s hands are on her skin, and she can smell her perfume (the fact that she shouldn\u2019t be able to over the chlorine doesn\u2019t seem to matter) and there\u2019s a voice in her ear, low and throaty and very familiar.\n\n\u201dNot so buttoned-up now, are you?\u201d\n\nAnd unbuttoned Kara surely is. Lena\u2019s hands are moving up towards her breasts, which feel sort of tingly, and all she wants to do is turn around and do something but she isn\u2019t sure what. She isn\u2019t even sure what\u2019s happening now. She\u2019s never been touched like this, slowly and with intent to unwind, and she\u2019s never felt this way before. Fingers creep upwards, ever upwards, until they\u2019re just about to cup \u2013\nKara wakes to the quiet trill of her alarm, and she hits it before Mike wakes up just like always. Only this time she\u2019s sweaty and trembling, her nipples feeling tight and sensitive and some very suspect throbbing happening between her legs. The details of the dream slip through her fingers like sand \u2013 there was a pool, and Lena, and something that\u2019s made her thighs very slippery \u2013\nMike rolls over, grunting, and Kara jumps out of bed. She needs to clean up and calm down before he gets up to start his day, and she puts the dream out of her mind.\nThere\u2019s no sense dwelling on it, anyways.\nAfter that first night, the strange dreams don\u2019t stop.\nThey aren\u2019t always quite so alarming as the first one. Sometimes they\u2019re completely innocuous \u2013 often she and Lena are just together, existing in the same space. Sometimes they\u2019re on the couch again, Lena\u2019s head in her lap, fingers tracing tingly patterns all over Kara\u2019s hands. But sometimes those patterns drift up her arms, or over her thighs, and she\u2019s not entirely sure what to think about that.\nEven more confusing are the dreams that aren\u2019t so innocuous.\nIn those dreams, Lena\u2019s hands are more insistent - Lena touches her firmly in places that don\u2019t seem friendly. Places that even her husband ignores. Her neck, her thighs, her breasts. The image of Lena in a black bikini from that day at the pool haunts her, or the way she looked as she wiped Kara\u2019s lipstick off in the changing room. And in these dreams there\u2019s always a sense of urgency, the knowledge that there\u2019s something she should be doing, wants to do, but she can\u2019t quite grasp what it is. All she can do is keep still - and, without fail, they end before she can make heads or tails of their meaning, and she wakes up sweaty and bewildered. It\u2019s maddening.\nBut, as confusing as they are, Kara always seems to wake up feeling strangely\u2026happy.\nShe manages to file the strange thoughts away, for the most part. She spends as much of her days with Lena as she can, talking and listening to Lena\u2019s expensive record collection. Occasionally they go out to get ice cream or just to drive, and sometimes when they go into the city Jack tags along. Despite herself, Kara even grows to like him.\nAnd all of it, every hour spent listening to to Lena\u2019s favourite singer (Joni Mitchell, whose melancholy voice Kara had heard coming from Lena\u2019s house that first day they met - the soundtrack to their strange friendship) or feeling her heart rate rise as her friend licks an ice cream cone, Kara hides from her husband. She\u2019s always home with dinner on the table before he\u2019s any the wiser.\nHe wouldn\u2019t understand. Even Kara doesn\u2019t fully understand.\nShe doesn\u2019t understand why she\u2019s so drawn to Lena Luthor. She doesn\u2019t understand why she buys a Joni Mitchell album and listens to it when she\u2019s alone, feeling her chest expand with something she can\u2019t identify. She doesn\u2019t understand why she keeps waking up trembling and fraught with tension. And she doesn\u2019t understand why, while she works on folding laundry on a mild Tuesday, idly thinking about last night\u2019s dream, she leans into the corner of the basket and feels like a pressure valve in her lower body has been released.\nIt feels good. So good that Kara groans without meaning to, the loud sound startling her enough that she moves away quickly.\nThe feeling is gone as suddenly as it came, and Kara leans back and tries to figure out what on earth happened.\nShe\u2019s doing exactly what she always does \u2013 she has the basket upturned and is using the bottom as a sort of table to fold Mike\u2019s shirts. She had leaned forward to grab one that fell and unfolded itself, and the corner pressed into her pelvis. And then the feeling happened.\nApprehensively, she leans forward again, pressing herself into the corner \u2013\nThe feeling returns twofold, and she couldn\u2019t stop the noise that leaves her mouth if she tried. It feels indescribably good, like nothing she\u2019s ever felt in her life \u2013 somehow, the pressing of hard plastic into the cleft between her legs is making her feel like she\u2019s going to come out of her skin. Kara leans forward harder, her heart pounding, and the feeling seems to crawl up from the point of pressure to wrap around her chest, all the way up to the base of her neck.\nUnbidden, thoughts of Lena from last night pop into her head \u2013 they had been in the changing room again, and Lena\u2019s hands hadn\u2019t stopped after three buttons. They kept going, and then just before Kara woke up they had smoothed up her belly all the way to her chest, which, unlike the real memory, had been completely bare.\nThe thought brings a pulse with it, so similar to the ones she often wakes up to but more intense, and Kara leans harder, hearing herself whimper as if she\u2019s floating above the scene, and gosh it feels good, it feels so strange and awful and wonderful \u2013\nAnd then the downstairs the phone rings, its harsh trill startling her so badly that she upturns the entire basket and all the folded laundry on top.\nFor a moment she stands, feeling her blood pound through her body and something between her legs throb in time with it, and it takes three rings before she hurries down to answer it, feeling like she\u2019s been caught doing something terrible.\nAfter that, it\u2019s difficult to look Lena in the face without a strange sense of shame.\nNot that it stops her. Lena is so pleasant to look at, after all, and even after Kara opted out of coming over that strange afternoon, she continues to be a perfect friend. She even invites Kara to her next party, even though she must know that it\u2019s unlikely that Mike will let them go.\nKara, determined to be even close to as good a friend as Lena has been, manages to convince him that this one will be more normal, since Lena now knows who she should and should not invite.\nThe party is definitely not normal.\nLast time, other people from the neighborhood had been there \u2013 people she knew, however unwillingly, and who gave the gathering a sense of decency. Most of them aren\u2019t present this time. Instead couples are scattered all over the space in various states of interlocking lips and bodies, and Mike scoffs the moment they walk in the door.\n\u201cWhat was it you were saying about her not knowing any better?\u201d\nKara has nothing to say. She can\u2019t explain it away this time \u2013 Lena is hosting a swinger\u2019s party.\nIt doesn\u2019t bother her so much as it confuses her \u2013 Lena is so nice, and smart, and wonderful. Why does she feel the need to have these people in her house?\nThankfully, Mike spots a neighbor in the kitchen, and Kara is able to extricate herself pretty easily once they get started on talking about stocks.\nLike last time, she has a hard time finding Lena in the crowd. It\u2019s a sea of people with a common purpose, but the hostess is lost in it. She finally spots her at the edges of the party, tucked into a corner with a polaroid camera held up to her face. As Kara watches she snaps a picture, removes it from the receptacle, sets it in a small stack, and holds the camera up again, scanning the room slowly for another shot.\nShe\u2019s so focused on the task that she doesn\u2019t notice Kara approaching, and she jumps so hard that she almost spills her cocktail when Kara taps her on the shoulder.\n\u201cKara!\u201d She exclaims, with more excitement than Kara was expecting. She even jumps up and gives Kara a hug, and she gets a waft of perfume that makes her chest a little tight. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to see you!\u201d She stumbles a little when she tries to sit back down, and Kara has to steady her.\nKara gets the feeling she\u2019s a little tipsy.\n\u201cWhat are you doing all the way over here?\u201d Kara asks as Lena displaces the stack of photos, huffing in annoyance.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026observing,\u201d Lena says vaguely, holding up the camera. She stacks the pile of pictures neatly again, and pulls a new one out of the camera slot.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be mingling, at your own party?\u201d\nA heavy sort of sadness seems to settle over Lena, then. She waves a polaroid idly as it develops, fanning herself with it, and it makes her hair flicker around her face.\n\u201cI prefer this,\u201d she says, not quite meeting Kara\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m never really\u2026happy, at these parties. But other people are. And if I can capture it like this, even if it\u2019s fleeting, maybe I can bottle a little bit of their happiness up. And keep it, for me.\u201d\nKara, not expecting that level of honesty, swallows and sits down. She\u2019s never seen Lena this melancholy, or this inebriated, and it\u2019s a little worrying.\n\u201cIs that why all your other work is like that too?\u201d Kara asks, looking around at some of the framed works still visible in the dim lighting. \u201cYou never engage with the people you photograph.\u201d\nLena shrugs, and snaps another photo. She\u2019s never been this nonverbal with her before, this disconnected \u2013 it\u2019s like she\u2019s in another world, and somehow Kara\u2019s presence is making it worse. She has no idea how to get Lena to respond. Instead, she deflects, asking the question she\u2019s been wondering since she walked in.\n\u201cLena, why do you have these parties? Why do you invite all these people to your house?\u201d\nLena sighs, setting her camera down and rubbing tiredly at her face.\n\u201cYou\u2019re starting to sound like your husband,\u201d Lena grumbles into her hands, and the comment hits Kara like an arrow.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m not judging,\u201d Kara rushes to clarify, \u201cI\u2019m just so confused. Do you really do this? Do you\u2026have sex with these married men?\u201d\nLena shakes her head, her gaze fixed distantly somewhere over Kara\u2019s head.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cThen, I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Kara says. The logic just doesn\u2019t make sense. Why let all these swingers trash her house and act lewd all night if she\u2019s not one of them? Why make the rest of the neighbors hate her if she\u2019s not even engaging in the behaviour?\nLena sighs, picking up her drink, and her gaze finally meets Kara\u2019s full-on.\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t, do you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nThe sadness in Lena\u2019s eyes makes Kara\u2019s chest hurt. She wants to fix it, somehow, but she just doesn\u2019t understand. She\u2019s missing something, here, and nobody will explain it to her. It\u2019s like her dreams all over again.\nThe reminder of her dreams brings up thoughts of what she did yesterday, and with Lena sitting so close to her, suddenly she feels hot all over.\nKara is torn between relief and despair when Lena stands up, finishing her drink in a gulp and setting the glass down beside her abandoned camera.\n\u201cNothing, Kara. Enjoy the party.\u201d\nShe kisses Kara on the cheek - so close to her mouth that her lips tingle - and heads towards the kitchen, but he\u2019s intercepted on the way by a beautiful woman in a bathing suit.\nIt\u2019s one of the wives that was just in the pool, one Kara recognizes as Imra, a woman a few streets over who often takes walks with her children that pass Kara\u2019s house. She touches Lena\u2019s arm and whispers something in her ear, and Lena gets that sad look again \u2013 Kara could swear her eyes flick over in her direction again - before she smiles in a sort of halfhearted way, and leads Imra down the hallway to a different room.\nKara doesn\u2019t get much time to contemplate the strangeness of the interaction before Mike is at her side.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going home. I can\u2019t believe I let you drag me to this freakshow again,\u201d he says loudly, and a few people look up from their conversation to give him dirty looks.\n\u201cHoney, we only just got here \u2013\u201c Kara tries to protest, but it seems futile, especially now that Lena has disappeared in her strange fit of mood. Mike is already handing over her coat, and she follows him with a heavy heart.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you socializing with this woman anymore. She\u2019s a bad influence,\u201d Mike grouses as he unlocks the door to their house. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to start giving you ideas.\u201d \u00a0\nThe idea of not seeing Lena again is intolerable, untenable, and Kara has never been more glad that Mike is always gone during the day.\nMike falls asleep almost as soon as his head hits the pillow, but Kara is up long into the night, just trying to decipher Lena\u2019s behaviour. The deeply sad way that she said you really don\u2019t, do you? The way she looked as she guided Imra down the hallway by the hand. The way the sight of them disappearing together soured her stomach for reasons she doesn\u2019t understand. She feels like she\u2019s inches away from something, something big, and she just can\u2019t figure it out.\nWhen Lena calls the next day to apologize for acting strangely, Kara doesn\u2019t even consider not picking up the phone.\nIf she needs to keep their friendship from her husband, so be it. Lena is too important to her. Lena encourages her to speak her mind, and gives her a taste of freedom during her stagnant days. Lena bought her the first outfit she\u2019s ever felt comfortable in, just because she could.\nIt\u2019s that fact \u2013 the fact that Lena bought them for her, the fact that she feels comfortable wearing them even if she\u2019s terrified of anyone seeing her \u2013 is what drives Kara to put them on and go over to Lena\u2019s in broad daylight.\nSure, she runs there as fast as her legs can take her so that that nobody will see. But it\u2019s still a big step, and the delight on Lena\u2019s face when she opens the door makes it worth it.\n\u201cKara! Look at you, scandalizing the neighborhood. I\u2019m so proud,\u201d Lena winks, inviting Kara in, and Kara steps inside gratefully. \u201cYou look fantastic.\u201d\nSomething twists at the apex of her thighs at the compliment, something hot and alive, and she suddenly feels very exposed in her new pants. Like without the protective shell of a skirt, Lena will see it somehow.\nLena gets them both a martini \u2013 she\u2019s not sure when she got into the habit of casual day drinking, but it seems so natural now \u2013 and smiles at her as she takes a sip.\n\u201cI get the feeling your husband wouldn\u2019t approve of you being here.\u201d\nKara huffs, taking a large gulp of her drink and wincing as it goes down hard. \u201cOh, my husband can stuff it.\u201d\nLena laughs abruptly, looking shocked, and Kara is honestly surprised at herself. It\u2019s a sentiment she\u2019s always felt but never voiced, and the freedom of it loosens her chest, as does the quiet, happy look on Lena\u2019s face.\n\u201cKara, what\u2019s your real last name?\u201d Lena finally asks, putting down her half-empty martini glass. Kara almost chokes mid-sip, sputtering over the vodka.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, your last name. Not your husband\u2019s name,\u201d Lena clarifies. \u201cWhat\u2019s your real name?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a question Kara has never been asked before. After 6 years of marriage, her maiden name seems long behind her. But Lena looks genuinely curious.\n\u201cWhen I married, my name was Danvers. Kara Danvers.\u201d\nLena smiles, licking her lips and repeating the name. \u201cDanvers. Danvers.\u201d\nShe says it slowly, as if she\u2019s tasting it and finding it satisfying. Finally, she holds an arm out to shake, reminiscent of their first meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Kara Danvers.\u201d\nEven now, months later, Kara is still struck by the size and strength of those hands.\nLena refills her glass when it empties, and Kara is feeling relaxed and happy when Lena pulls out her polaroid and asks to photograph her.\n\u201cI want to capture you. The real you. The first true picture of Kara Danvers,\u201d Lena says, her eyes bright with excitement, and Kara thinks back to their conversation at the party \u2013 how Lena usually prefers to photograph from afar, capture the untouchable. Now, Lena wants to capture her. Up close and personal. The thought makes her a little bit sweaty \u2013 but, she could never deny anything that gets Lena so bright-eyed.\nJust like the first day Kara tried them on, Lena pulls the pins from Kara\u2019s hair and lets it spill over her shoulders, and eases her glasses from her face. She sits Kara on the ottoman in her living room and, rather than posing her, just tells her to do what feels natural.\nKara realizes quickly that she has no idea what feels natural.\nLena starts out far away, taking pictures of Kara\u2019s stiff posture from a distance. But as the minutes wear on and Lena keeps making little jokes that make her giggle, she starts to relax, until finally she\u2019s leaning forward with her elbows on her knees, looking up at Lena with a real smile.\nUnder Lena\u2019s intense focus, she feels like she\u2019s opening up somehow. Growing, and becoming something greater. Her forearms look different, braced against her thighs like this \u2013 they look muscular, strong, and for the first time that seems like a good thing. She can feel the defined line of her shoulders pressing against her shirt, and the way Lena\u2019s eyes drift across it. Her legs feel articulated from her body, not trapped under her usual stiff skirts, and she spreads them and relaxes with a lack of shame that surprises her.\nThere\u2019s something inside her that\u2019s glowing like an ember, and Lena\u2019s green eyes are stoking it.\nLena snaps picture after picture, each one a closer shot than the last, until finally they\u2019re all out and developing. When the first few are visible, Kara can hardly believe it.\nShe looks good. She looks\u2026attractive.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even look like me,\u201d Kara says quietly, looking back and forth between two shots. Lena takes them from her, and hands her two newly-developed ones.\n\u201cIt does,\u201d Lena says. \u201cLook closer. This is how I see you, Kara. You\u2019re\u2026fascinating.\u201d Lena\u2019s voice is so quiet on the last word that Kara almost can\u2019t hear it.\nThe person looking back at her, the person Lena sees, is both a stranger and intimately familiar. The person she never thought she could be. Lena is sitting too close to her, all heat and distraction, and Kara never wants to move away.\nLena is such a good friend. She\u2019s such a good friend that it makes Kara\u2019s chest ache.\nLena ends up giving Kara two photos to take home \u2013 one of her, sitting on the Ottoman and looking more confident than she\u2019s ever felt, and one of the two of them taken close up, slightly off-kilter because Lena had been holding her arm out and snapping it blindly. Lena is laughing, and Kara is looking at her with an emotion she can\u2019t explain.\nShe wonders if that\u2019s always how she looks, when she looks at Lena. If anyone else can see it.\nKara puts them in her bedside drawer, between the pages of her favourite book. Sometimes, when Mike is making her feel stifled in her own house, she goes to the bathroom with them and just looks, just remembers how she felt that day. How happy she was. How free.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSomehow, after all these months of friendship, Kara has never once been in Lena\u2019s pool.\nIt\u2019s not something she\u2019s ever really thought about. She\u2019s never had cause to do much swimming \u2013 even when they visit Mike\u2019s family cabin, she usually just sits on the dock and reads a book. She doesn\u2019t even really have a swimsuit she likes \u2013 the only one she owns is so old-fashioned that she doesn\u2019t ever want to wear it in public.\nSo, when she goes for her daily visit one innocuous day in June and Lena opens the door in her bikini, clearly mid-swim, she doesn\u2019t even consider that Lena might want to swim with her until she outright asks.\nWhich is how she finds herself in Lena\u2019s bathroom, with a selection of Lena\u2019s bikinis laid out and the instruction to \u2018borrow whichever one fits\u2019.\nThey\u2019re clearly different sizes, but Kara manages to find a top that she can tie tight enough, and a pair of Lena\u2019s shorts for bottoms. Part of her realizes as she puts it on that she could have very easily gone next door and gotten her own, but there\u2019s something strange and electric about wearing Lena\u2019s clothes.\nShe\u2019s never worn so little fabric in her life. She wraps one of Lena\u2019s large fluffy towels tightly around herself, and heads out to the pool.\nWhen Lena emerges from the water to meet her, rivulets streaming down her body, Kara\u2019s whole being throbs in a very unfriendly way. It\u2019s a completely unfamiliar feeling, one she can\u2019t fully identify besides feeling like it\u2019s somehow wrong, like she should look away. But she can\u2019t. It feels like that day she met Jack all over again, except that this time he isn\u2019t here as a loud, boisterous buffer for Kara to hide behind when she feels funny like this.\n\u201cCome on in, the water\u2019s nice and warm,\u201d Lena assures her, taking a large sip of her fruity-looking margarita and blissfully unaware of how Kara\u2019s traitorous eyes track every drop of water that runs down her stomach. She looks so feminine and soft, all curves and swells, and Kara has no idea why that thought is so distracting.\n\u201cJust \u2013 um, just give me a second,\u201d Kara stammers, pulling the towel tighter. Faced with Lena\u2019s perfect body, she doesn\u2019t want to reveal her own \u2013 she\u2019s too lean, she knows, all wiry muscle. Not feminine at all. Her hips are too narrow, and her breasts are too small. That\u2019s what everyone has always told her. Her clothes usually cover that, create an illusion, and with the minimal fabric she has on right now, she might as well just be baring herself to Lena\u2019s eyes completely naked.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t swim in a towel, Kara,\u201d Lena says, reaching out to grab at it, but Kara dances away.\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s okay, I \u2013 I need sunblock, first!\u201d Kara insists, grabbing at the open bottle of cream from the minibar next to the pool. She holds it out like a shield, but Lena only steps closer.\n\u201cWell, let me put it on for you.\u201d\nThat thought \u2013 the idea of Lena\u2019s hands on her body, spreading warm lotion over her skin \u2013 is even worse than the bathing suit.\n\u201cNo \u2013\u201c Kara yells, and at Lena\u2019s alarmed expression, she quiets her voice. \u201cI mean, actually, I don\u2019t burn very easily, but maybe I should just stay up on the patio?\u201d\n\u201cKara, you\u2019re being silly \u2013\u201c Lena makes another grab for the towel, and this time she manages to catch it and yank. It comes free, and Kara is left standing in short shorts and a bikini top, feeling as bare as a newborn.\nAnd Lena just stares.\nHer eyes rake over Kara\u2019s shoulders and arms, over her stomach and her bare legs, in a way that\u2019s disconcerting. It doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s being judged, as she expected, but it does feel different, and Lena\u2019s pale skin has gone rosy.\nJust when Kara is about to ask her what\u2019s wrong, Lena seems to snap out of it - and she pushes Kara into the pool. The last thing Kara sees before she hits the water is Lena\u2019s face, wide-eyed and flushed, in an expression of pained realization.\nWhen Kara surfaces again, shaking water out of her eyes, her first order of business is to shout.\n\u201cLena!\u201d she yells, indignant and still surprised, but Lena has already jumped in beside her, splashing the side of her face with more water.\nLena, of course, surfaces perfectly, her hair slicked back and water droplets forming on her eyelashes. In contrast, Kara\u2019s long hair is still stuck to her face, and the shorts Lena let her borrow are riding up.\n\u201cWhat the heck, Lena!\u201d Kara sputters, trying to sort her tangled hair out, and Lena shrugs.\n\u201cHow else was I going to get you in here?\u201d Lena says cheekily, and the strangeness from before seems to be gone.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m gonna get you \u2013\u201c\nShe splashes Lena, giving her a faceful of pool water, and the war begins. They chase each other around the pool, giggling and shouting like children, and Kara\u2019s sides feel sore from laughing when Lena finally jumps on her back and latches on, playfully shoving her head under the water.\nKara surfaces again, laughing, and grabs for Lena\u2019s legs, pulling her around with the intention to dunk her under the water in retaliation \u2013 but Lena latches on like a koala, her legs wrapping around Kara\u2019s waist. Kara\u2019s hands go, instinctually, to Lena's thighs.\nThe game stops immediately.\nSuddenly Kara is very aware of every inch of touching skin, every scrap of fabric, every tiny movement, every puff of Lena\u2019s breath on her face. And Lena seems just as affected. She\u2019s staring at Kara\u2019s lips with an indecipherable expression.\nWith no warning, Kara gets hit with a thought that goes off in her brain like a gunshot.\nThey\u2019re close enough to kiss.\nThe very thought, the idea of kissing a woman, kissing Lena, is like a foreign language. But something about it resonates somewhere deep inside. Like a tuning fork, striking a note that lines up exactly with all of her strange dreams.\nShe wonders, suddenly, how those dreams would have continued if they kissed.\nEven with the strangeness of Kara\u2019s thoughts, it\u2019s Lena who pulls away, whose eyes widen with alarm, and she launches herself off of Kara\u2019s body so hard that Kara is propelled back a foot or so into the deeper end of the pool. Lena stands abruptly, the water up to her hips, and she looks about 30 seconds from a full-blown panic attack.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Kara, but I forgot, I \u2013 I promised Jack I\u2019d go into the city to meet him,\u201d Lena says, her voice unnaturally high. She\u2019s already getting out of the pool, wrapping Kara\u2019s abandoned towel around herself. \u201cYou understand \u2013\u201c\n\u201cOh!\u201d Kara replies, her brain still struggling to keep up with the rapid-fire nature of the last few minutes. \u201cOkay, I \u2013 just let me change \u2013\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, honestly, just keep the suit,\u201d Lena says dismissively, already stepping into the house. \u201cI really have to go, okay? I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\nThe back door shuts behind her before Kara can even respond.\nSo Kara goes home, her clothes thrown haphazardly over Lena\u2019s swimsuit, as if her entire body isn\u2019t on fire from the memory of 10 seconds in Lena\u2019s space.\nKara doesn\u2019t see her friend for over a week after that.\nLena\u2019s car peals out of her driveway and down the street only 15 minutes after Kara gets home, and it just doesn\u2019t come back. Kara tries calling, tries knocking, tries peering over the fence, but Lena is nowhere to be seen. The lights are off, the car is still gone, and the house is empty. \u00a0\nA few days in, she starts to get worried.\nLena could be anywhere. She didn\u2019t so much as leave a note \u2013 what if she got in some sort of car accident? What if she was kidnapped? Kara\u2019s fevered brain invents all sorts of horrific scenarios, each worse than the last, and she\u2019s a few days from calling the police in her panic when, in the middle of the day, Lena\u2019s car pulls into the drive.\nThe relief Kara feels when Lena emerges with a suitcase, in her sunglasses and a floppy hat, is enough to give her a head rush.\nKara practically runs next door before Lena is finished getting herself inside.\n\u201cLena!\u201d she calls, waving as the brunette hauls her suitcase up the steps to her door. \u201cWhere on earth have you been?\u201d\nLena stops dead. Kara was expecting at least a smile, maybe even an apology, but Lena just looks at her with something close to fear.\n\u201cI went to visit a friend,\u201d Lena says quietly, and Kara nods.\n\u201cYeah, Jack, you mentioned. You didn\u2019t say you\u2019d be gone a week! I was worried.\u201d\nLena shakes her head. \u201cNo, I went to see my friend Sam. She has a lake house upstate.\u201d\nLena is uncharacteristically quiet, almost withdrawn, and when she takes off her sunglasses, her eyes are red-rimmed. She can\u2019t seem to meet Kara\u2019s gaze directly. It feels off, somehow. Wrong. Lena has never been like this with her, not even that strange night at the party.\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t you talk to me?\u201d Kara asks quietly, and Lena finally meets her eyes in pure surprise.\n\u201cI\u2026don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Lena says edgily, and the words stab Kara unexpectedly hard.\n\u201cI thought we were friends,\u201d Kara says, failing to mask her wounded tone. \u201cBest friends.\u201d\nThe shadow on Lena\u2019s face gets darker, and she seems to ache just as much as Kara does. She looks just as beautiful as ever, and Kara drinks in her face like she\u2019s been stuck in the Nevada desert for a week rather than in her own home. The paleness of Lena\u2019s face makes Kara doubt she spent any time outside in the last 5 days, but it makes her features that much more stark \u2013 her sharp jawline, her expressive brows, her soft lips, the tiny scar at the corner of her right eye. After all this time apart, all Kara wants to do is spend the rest of the day in her calming presence.\nBut Lena still turns away, still goes inside and doesn\u2019t invite Kara in after her.\n\u201cWe are friends, Kara. I\u2019ll see you later, okay?\u201d\nLena shuts the door in her face, and Kara goes home feeling empty.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe tries to keep going without her friendship with Lena. She survived before they met, and she can survive now. But everything just seems so much harder.\nKissing Mike on the cheek every morning, making his breakfast, washing his clothes, following his rules \u2013 it\u2019s all excruciating, now, and what makes it worse is that she has no idea what she did to make Lena not want to talk to her. That day in the pool had been weird, but she didn\u2019t think she did anything bad \u2013 she goes over and over the day in her head, dissecting every detail, and it makes her feel like she\u2019s running in circles. It\u2019s painfully lonesome, and with every Lena-less day that goes by she feels a little bit more trapped.\nShe\u2019s so grateful when Alex calls and asks to visit that she almost starts to cry.\nIt\u2019s not often that she gets to see her sister \u2013 she lives in the city, quite a drive from Kara\u2019s quiet suburb, and her work keeps her so busy that they sometimes only get to reconnect at holidays. Alex planning a trip out here in the middle of the week is odd, but Kara is so isolated lately that she doesn\u2019t question it.\nAt least, she doesn\u2019t question it until Alex is pacing the sitting room in a nervous spiral, looking like the devil himself is on her tail.\nThe tea that Kara made them is abandoned on the coffee table, as Kara tries her best to calm her down.\n\u201cAlex, what\u2019s going on? You\u2019re running around like a racehorse, here.\u201d\nAlex just keeps pacing, wringing her hands desperately. She\u2019s deadly pale, and Kara wishes she had any idea what was going on. Everything is topsy-turvy in her life right now, and Alex being in a tizzy isn\u2019t helping.\n\u201cI have something to tell you,\u201d Alex says, and her voice is small and nervous and unfamiliar. The Alex she knows is forward, confident, assertive. This Alex is a wreck.\n\u201cOkay, what is it?\u201d Kara asks, throwing up her hands. \u201cJust tell me.\u201d\nAlex just paces more, shaking her head and chewing at her thumb.\n\u201cAlex, oh my gosh, what? Did you lose your job?\u201d\nAlex shakes her head.\n\u201cDid you \u2013 please stop pacing, you\u2019re making me dizzy \u2013 did you kill someone?\u201d\nAlex stops in her tracks, pinning Kara with a look. It\u2019s the same look she gave Kara when they were teenagers and Kara asked if she was going steady with Maxwell Lord, the student body president who used to send her flowers. It\u2019s a look that says, seriously?\nKara throws her hands up, starting to get frustrated with the lack of response.\n\u201cWell, Christ, Alex, what do you expect me to think with the way you\u2019re acting \u2013\u201c\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a lesbian.\u201d\nKara stops talking, then.\nIntellectually, she knows what the words mean. I\u2019m a lesbian. A woman who\u2026does things\u2026with other women. A gay woman. But the reality of it isn\u2019t quite connecting with Alex. Alex can\u2019t be one of those women. Those women are bad, aren\u2019t they? That\u2019s what Mike always says \u2013 it\u2019s what he said when he opened the newspaper to read about those riots in New York City only a month previous. That \u2018those people\u2019 were part of why society is declining.\nBut in her heart, she knows. Jack is gay, and she likes Jack. He\u2019s funny, and kind, even if she sort of wanted to hit him at first.\nAnd, this is Alex. Mike is wrong. He has to be.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Kara says carefully, and Alex stops pacing at least, but she still refuses to sit down next to her.\n\u201cI met this woman. At work. Her name is Maggie.\u201d\n\u201cMaggie?\u201d Kara parrots, and Alex nods, pushing forward with what seems like a difficult story.\n\u201cI got to know her, and she just seemed so\u2026interesting, you know? No, I guess you don\u2019t. But, I just wanted to be closer. All the time, always.\u201d\n\u201cCloser,\u201d Kara repeats needlessly. Alex hardly seems to hear her.\n\u201cAnd I felt all these\u2026feelings\u2026and I couldn\u2019t explain them,\u201d Alex soldiers on, the pacing starting up again. \u201cIn my chest, and my stomach, and \u2013 but they felt good! They were scary, but good.\u201d\n\u201cFeelings.\u201d\nKara feels like she should be saying something else, contributing to the conversation somehow, but something complicated is happening in the larger part of her brain, and all she can do is repeat what Alex is saying back to her and hope it\u2019s enough.\n\u201cAnd then \u2013 and then she kissed me!\u201d Alex finally says, and she sounds like she can hardly believe it herself.\nThat startles Kara enough to form a full answer.\n\u201cShe kissed you? On the lips?\u201d Kara asks loudly, and Alex nods, running her hands through her short hair. Her fingers disrupt the hold of her hairspray, and it sticks up at odd angles and makes her look wild.\n\u201cYeah. And, it was incredible, it was \u2013 it was exhilarating. I\u2019ve kissed boys before, dated, gone all the way, and it never felt right, it never felt good \u2013 and then Maggie kissed me, and \u2013 god, I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d\nKara has no answer for her this time, not even a simple word. She\u2019s too busy thinking. Thinking about how everything Alex is saying, minus the kissing, is eerily similar to how she feels about Lena.\nAnd then, she\u2019s thinking about kissing Lena, and everything goes a little bit fuzzy.\n\u201cKara?\u201d\nShe\u2019s jarred from her thoughts by Alex\u2019s voice, sounding as small and frightened as she\u2019s ever heard it. Alex has finally stopped pacing again, and she looks\u2026\nShe looks terrified.\n\u201cI know this is hard to understand, and \u2013 and you might hate me, but this is the way I am,\u201d Alex says, and her voice is thick. \u201cIt took me a long time to figure out, and I hated myself for so long for feeling this way, but I can\u2019t go back \u2013\u201c\nAnd, to Kara\u2019s horror, Alex starts to cry.\n\u201cAlex, oh gosh, no, I don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s okay! I don\u2019t hate you!\u201d Kara says hurriedly, standing up and putting her hands on Alex\u2019s shoulders. Alex wipes angrily at the tears as if they\u2019ve personally offended her, looking skeptical.\n\u201cYou were just looking at me like I had three heads,\u201d she mutters, and Kara winces.\n\u201cI was just thinking. I\u2019m sorry \u2013 look, will you sit down a minute?\u201d\nAlex finally sits gingerly down on the sofa, and Kara puts her arms around her, squeezing tight.\n\u201cI love you, Alex,\u201d Kara says, slowly and honestly. \u201cNo matter what, and no matter who you\u2019re kissing. I promise.\u201d\nAlex relaxes so much that Kara worries she\u2019s going to fall off the couch. She buries her face in her hands, and Kara is worried she\u2019s started to cry again until she starts laughing. She laughs, harder and harder, until Kara joins her and they spend long, cathartic moments just letting it out.\n\u201cGod, I was so worried,\u201d Alex says when the giggles have petered off, her voice muffled.\n\u201cWhy? Did you really think\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Alex sighs. \u201cI was just scared. I know Mike\u2019s opinions on all of this. And it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not exactly a safe thing to be.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cPeople like me get the shit kicked out of us, Kara. Even by the police. \u2018Homosexual acts\u2019 aren\u2019t even legal.\u201d\nThat the law might be involved in all this is something Kara hadn\u2019t known about, or even considered. For love, Alex\u2019s love, to be illegal \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make sense. But a sense of understanding starts to dawn as Kara\u2019s thoughts echo with a conversation she thought she\u2019d forgotten \u2013 Lena, at her island, rolling a joint and saying \u2018lots of things are illegal, Kara.\u2019.\nLike a series of firecrackers in her brain, one after another, everything starts to make sense. Lena starts to make sense.\nThe way she\u2019s always acted like Kara was somehow clueless, how she\u2019s always felt like there was something Lena was hiding from her. The lipstick mark that was on her neck at that first party \u2013 Lucy\u2019s shade. Of course it was Lucy\u2019s shade. Her strange conversation with Jack \u2013 of course, Jack likes men, and he must have been about to reveal that Lena was like him. But Lena stopped him. How Lena denied sleeping with strange men at her parties, and the way that Imra looked at Lena, almost hungrily, as they disappeared down the hall.\nThe tingles Kara felt when Lena kissed her cheek, and how she felt a strange longing to turn her head until their lips met.\nIt\u2019s like an optical illusion from one of those children\u2019s art books \u2013 she\u2019s been looking at Lena a certain way for so long, and suddenly, with no warning, her vision shifts.\nLena could be a lesbian. And Kara\u2026Kara wants to kiss her.\n\u201cAlex\u2026do you think maybe\u2026I could be, too?\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t even fully mean to say it. It\u2019s what she\u2019s been thinking, but saying it out loud seemed too scary, until she did. And now it\u2019s out there.\nAlex looks at her quizzically. \u201cCould what?\u201d\n\u201cCould be\u2026you know,\u201d Kara edges quietly. Alex sits up, crossing her arms and looking at Kara with a surprised but knowing look.\n\u201cCould be what, Kara?\u201d\n\u201cA\u2026could be a\u2026\u201d\nShe can say it. It\u2019s not a dirty word. It\u2019s what Alex is, and maybe Lena, and they\u2019re her two favourite people in the world.\nMaybe even her, too.\n\u201cMaybe I could be\u2026like you,\u201d is what she finally manages, whispering as if half the neighborhood might be pressing their ears to the keyhole and listening. The thought is frightening, but even just saying it out loud brings a sense of intense relief.\nAlex is quiet for a minute, looking at Kara as if she\u2019s trying to gauge her seriousness. When she seems to deem that Kara isn\u2019t playing some kind of cruel joke, she relaxes, and seems to consider the question fully.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Kara. What makes you think that?\u201d\nIt seems like a gargantuan task, explaining Lena to anyone. But Kara does her best.\nSo, Kara tells Alex about her life, the truth about it, for the first time ever. Alex frowns all through her talking about Mike, about how trapped she feels in a marriage she now regrets, but her face gentles when Kara moves on to Lena. The weird feelings, the tingling, the new clothes \u2013 she explains her strange dreams, her fascination with the woman next door. She tells her about the parties, about that day in the pool, and how Lena has acted since.\nBy the end of it Alex is nodding, her face soft and understanding in a way that\u2019s both terrifying and exhilarating at once.\n\u201cLook, Kara, I don\u2019t know what you are,\u201d she says gently, squeezing Kara\u2019s hands comfortingly. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that. But I can tell you that, whoever this Lena is\u2026she might be your Maggie.\u201d\nAnd that, apparently, is Kara\u2019s tear trigger.\nKara feels a little bit guilty that Alex came over here with the intent of revealing something deep and secret about herself, and instead she ends up holding Kara as she sobs uncontrollably into her shoulder in utter relief at finally having an explanation. An explanation for her strange feelings, and an explanation for the way Lena sometimes looks at her like she wants to risk it all.\nShe\u2019s not going crazy. She\u2019s just\u2026she\u2019s just gay.\nAlex rocks her until the tears subside, and they sit together on the couch, interrupted only by Kara\u2019s occasional hiccups.\n\u201cAlex, what am I going to do?\u201d Kara asks, when she feels like she can breathe again. Alex takes a deep breath, exhaling in a dramatic whoosh, and shrugs.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nKara sniffles, trying to sort through her thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m married. I don\u2019t want to be. But, divorce\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Alex says quietly, kissing the top of Kara\u2019s head. \u201cWhatever you decide to do\u2026my home is always open, okay? If you need to, you can come stay with me and get back on your feet. I\u2019ll support whatever decision you make.\u201d\nKara nods and takes the hankie Alex hands her, dabbing at her face. It feels infinitely better to have Alex\u2019s support, even if she still has a huge, life-changing decision to make.\nShe has a lot to think about tonight, and not much time to do so \u2013 tomorrow is Independence Day, and the family across the road is hosting a barbecue. She has to wash and iron Mike\u2019s clothes, and make potato salad, and then she has to spend the day on Mike\u2019s arm, trying not to think about the fact that there\u2019s clearly also a party going on at Lena\u2019s house and she hasn\u2019t been invited.\nSure, Mike wouldn\u2019t let her attend anyways after last time, but Lena always invites her. Always.\nThe day seems to drag by. She feels like she\u2019s having the same conversation over and over again \u2013 how are you? How\u2019s your husband? Is the bathroom renovation going well? Oh, yes, he\u2019s getting so big, last I saw him he was crawling \u2013 oh, no, Mike and I aren\u2019t expecting any time soon \u2013 no reason, just not the right time \u2013 oh yes, Sharon\u2019s Swedish meatballs are delicious \u2013 it\u2019s exhausting, a never-ending performance that she\u2019s not sure she can keep doing for much longer.\nWith Lena, she never feels trapped. Not for an instant.\nThe party next door seems even rowdier when Mike decides to go home and turn in, a little drunk and sleepy from the beers he\u2019s been consuming all day. Usually Kara would discourage him from having too many, but today she\u2019s grateful when he\u2019s snoring loudly by 9:30.\nOnce she\u2019s cleaned the Tupperware and picked up Mike\u2019s clothes from where he dropped them as he got into bed, Kara stands in the doorway of their bedroom, just looking.\nMike is sprawled out carelessly in the middle of the bed, his wedding ring glinting in the light from the streetlamp outside. She should feel some kind of affection for her husband, shouldn\u2019t she? Some trace of love, a hint of fondness. A spark of basic attraction, even, at the sight of his bare chest. That\u2019s what wives are supposed to feel. But she looks at him, and she feels nothing.\nLena makes her feel everything.\nAnd even if this all amounts to nothing, even if Lena wants nothing to do with her and she has to go stay with Alex and rebuild her life from the bottom\u2026anything is better than this.\nHer first instinct is to wake Mike up and tell him herself. But she can see, in her mind\u2019s eye, his reaction \u2013 he\u2019s always had a temper, and she knows exactly how bad it would be if she actually gave him a reason to be angry.\nThe thought of his response to the fact that she\u2019s leaving him for their female neighbor, when she\u2019s the only person in the house with him, makes her feel distinctly unsafe.\nSo, she sits down at the kitchen table with a pen and paper, and she puts it all down in a letter. Everything \u2013 how she never felt right, here, and how this is what she needs to do to make herself happy. How she\u2019s sorry to hurt him like this, but that she asks he don\u2019t try to stop her.\nTo top it all off, she pulls off her wedding ring. It\u2019s always felt like more of an anchor than anything else, and this final step of taking it off and setting it on top of her letter makes it all feel final. Like a big, final exhale.\nOnce that\u2019s done, she does something she\u2019d never even considered before \u2013 she gets dressed in the clothes Lena bought her, and sneaks out of her own house.\nWhen she gets to Lena\u2019s, the front door is open, and the party is in full swing \u2013 couples are in various states of undress, she sees two strangely-contorted foursomes in progress, and one couple blatantly has their hands in each other\u2019s pants.\nIt makes her a little bit ill to think that Lena might be doing that, too.\nBut to her relief Kara finds Lena alone, sitting in a deck chair by the pool with a martini in her hand that she isn\u2019t drinking, staring listlessly at the water. As Kara watches, a woman she recognizes from the last party approaches her and grabs her hand, trying to pull her to the dancefloor, but Lena refuses, waving her off. Lena isn\u2019t even wearing her usual makeup. She looks small and sad and beautiful.\nFilled with a sense of purpose that\u2019s been building all day, Kara marches over. When Lena sees her, her face brightens for a split second, before falling again.\n\u201cKara? What are you \u2013\u201c\nKara interrupts her, breathing hard not from exertion but from the fact that her heart is beating a mile a minute. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Lena says, wringing her hands. She looks ready to bolt. But Kara grabs gently at her sleeve, tugging.\n\u201cI know it isn\u2019t. But I need to.\u201d\n\u201cKara\u2026\u201d Lena whispers, looking around as if she\u2019s expecting someone to yell, to call out in protest. Maybe she\u2019s wondering where Mike is. She seems uncomfortable, so Kara grabs for her hand and pulls her to the closest private space \u2013 the walk-in coat closet next to the front door. She grabs for the cord to turn the light on, and even lit by the harsh bulb Lena is still breathtaking.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding me,\u201d Kara says bluntly, and she can hear Lena\u2019s sharp, surprised inhale. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t talk about this right now,\u201d Lena says quickly, reaching for the door handle, but Kara moves to intercept.\n\u201cThen when? When will you talk to me?\u201d\n\u201cI \u2013\u201c\nKara moves closer, coats rustling as she moves, and Lena\u2019s eyes get as big as saucers at the proximity. \u201cLena, please. I\u2019ve been so conflicted, lately. I didn\u2019t know which way was up, and you\u2026you make me a little crazy.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Lena whispers, her voice tiny. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2026I don\u2019t think you know what you want, Kara.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Kara agrees. \u201cBut I do now. I\u2019ve been thinking about you for months.\u201d\nLena looks pained. Aching. Like she wants to lean into what Kara is saying, but for some reason she can\u2019t.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just confused. I can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t do this to you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not confused,\u201d Kara insists, and then corrects herself. \u201cI mean, I was, but then Alex came and explained \u2013\u201c\n\u201cYour sister?\u201d Lena asks, her brow furrowed.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a lesbian.\u201d\nLena freezes, looking like a deer caught in the headlights. Her eyes are wider than ever, her mouth hanging slightly open, and Kara has the feeling that she\u2019s just said something Lena doesn\u2019t hear very often.\n\u201cShe told me what it means,\u201d Kara continues, her voice quiet. The moment feels still, like the moment before a jump. \u201cWhat it feels like. To like women.\u201d\nLena stays silent. Her hands are fisted in the fabric of her dress so tightly that her knuckles are white.\nKara is afraid \u2013 god, is she afraid \u2013 but she can\u2019t stop now. Not when she\u2019s this close.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen you, with other women. At parties like these,\u201d Kara says, barely above a whisper.\nLena swallows hard, the tendons in her neck flexing, and somehow the sight of it \u2013 how it makes her want to press her lips there, her teeth, her tongue \u2013 makes Kara feel brave.\n\u201cLena, are you gay?\u201d\nThe question hangs in the air between them; a curtain between their bodies that one word could pull down. Lena\u2019s jaw is so tense that Kara worries for her teeth, the muscle flexing with tension.\nSlowly, as if she\u2019s aware of how her answer fundamentally shifts everything between them, Lena nods.\nKara has known, really, since Alex came over yesterday. This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. But the admittance makes it real, and it\u2019s difficult to get her next words out past the wave of relief.\n\u201cI think I might be, too.\u201d\nLena\u2019s breath all comes out in a whoosh. Instead of the positive reaction Kara was hoping for she deflates like a balloon, her eyes look shiny.\n\u201cKara, I can\u2019t.\u201d Lena's voice cracks on the words, and Kara grabs desperately for her hands.\n\u201cWhy? Why not? Why can\u2019t we do this?\u201d One hand goes to Lena\u2019s hair, to her beautiful face, traces the outline of her jaw like she\u2019s secretly ached to do all these months. The warm skin under her fingers feels like a puzzle piece slotting in - and Lena leans into it, pressing her cheek into Kara\u2019s palm even as she denies her.\n\u201cYou\u2019re married.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been with married women! You slept with Mrs. Olsen, and Imra!\u201d Kara protests, and Lena shakes her head.\n\u201cThey were different. Their husbands were also sleeping with other people in the next room. Everyone was aware of the circumstances.\u201d Lena\u2019s eyes threaten to spill over, and she bites at her lip so hard that Kara can see the little indents left behind. \u201cI can\u2019t do it. Not like this.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving him.\u201d\nKara hadn\u2019t even been fully aware of the knowledge until a half hour ago. But it seems so obvious, now. She feels more just from standing close to Lena, from Lena\u2019s eyes on her, than she does in bed with her husband. He\u2019s harsh where Lena is soft, cruel where Lena is kind. He\u2019s a pair of shackles, and Lena is a car on the open highway.\nAnd, as much as it breaks her heart, even if Lena doesn\u2019t want her, she can\u2019t go back to the caged existence she lived before they met. Either way, with or without Lena, she\u2019s leaving this place.\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d Lena whispers, and she frowns. \u201cI can\u2019t ask you to do that.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not asking me. I\u2019m telling you. I already wrote him a letter.\u201d\n\u201cYou literally just decided this. I can\u2019t let you leave your whole life for me,\u201d Lena protests.\n\u201cI\u2019m not \u2013\u201c Kara sighs, frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s barely a life, Lena. I\u2019ve been miserable since before we even got married. I just\u2026I didn\u2019t know there was another option. And then you happened.\u201d\nLena\u2019s mouth is in an anxious twist, her teeth pulling at her lower lip, and Kara pushes on.\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving no matter what. I can\u2019t stay here, I can\u2019t be with him, now that I know. If you don\u2019t \u2013\u201c Kara\u2019s voice quavers, and she swallows hard to control it. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want this, I\u2019m going to go stay with Alex. She promised she\u2019d help me. But I want this. I want you. I want you so much.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a pregnant pause after Kara\u2019s speech. Lena seems unsure, and Kara doesn\u2019t want to push \u2013 she\u2019s done what she can do, and Lena has to meet her the rest of the way.\nFinally, Lena\u2019s shaky hand comes up to rest on Kara\u2019s sternum.\n\u201cI want you too,\u201d Lena whispers, and Kara could power a small town with the force of the feelings those words provoke in her.\nAnd then Lena\u2019s hand turns into a fist, clenching the fabric of Kara\u2019s shirt, and she pulls.\nThe moment their lips meet, Kara understands what Alex meant when she said that it just felt right.\nIt\u2019s something that Kara can\u2019t explain in words. Any and all kissing experience she might have had is nothing \u2013 nothing compared to Lena\u2019s lips brushing hers, the heat of the hand on her chest. The kiss is gentle, tentative, like Lena is giving her the opportunity to run, but all Kara wants is more. More kissing, more touching, more skin contact, just more. She wants to take all of Lena\u2019s clothes off, press against her like that day in the pool and see what happens if they don\u2019t stop.\nAs soon as Kara leans in more, pushes deeper, makes it absolutely clear that she isn\u2019t going anywhere, Lena seems to lose her inhibitions \u2013 and, Kara learns, the introduction of tongue to kissing is absolutely life-changing.\nWith an almost pained whine Lena slots their mouths together, hard, and their kisses turn messy and frantic. Kara\u2019s heart is beating so hard that she can hear it in her ears, feel her blood whizzing through her body, and that unfamiliar feeling from her strange dream has returned in full force \u2013 Lena is panting into her mouth, pressing her into the door, and those uncomfortable fumblings with her husband seem so far away as to be another person\u2019s life entirely. Lena is hot and vital, her hands shaking with want as she undoes the buttons of Kara\u2019s shirt and presses wet kisses to the revealed skin, and once she understands the intent Kara moves to help her. She hardly has time to consider that she hasn\u2019t a single clue what she\u2019s doing.\nBut, once the thought hits, it stays there. She doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing. Sexual relations are a foreign language to her \u2013 with Mike it was always a \u2018think about something else until it\u2019s over\u2019 situation, but with Lena, the last thing she wants to do is disengage. She wants to be aware of every single second.\nLena is pulling her tucked-in shirt from her pants before Kara remembers \u2013 she decided not to wear a brassiere in this outfit. Lena\u2019s hands are shaky as she undoes the buttons, and Kara feels like she should perhaps give her a warning but that might make Lena stop, a thought which is completely intolerable. The idea of Lena laying eyes on her bare chest is so potent that Kara is torn between gratitude and regret at her decision - it had just seemed right, at the time, and now \u2013\nNow, Lena is staring at her bare chest like it\u2019s the ninth wonder of the world.\n\u201cWow,\u201d she whispers, and Kara manages a strangled laugh as Lena\u2019s exploring hands move closer and closer to her exposed nipples. Just like every strange fantasy that\u2019s haunted her for months, but this time, she\u2019s not going to wake up before they reach their final destination.\n\u201cI \u2013 I\u2019ve had so many dreams like this \u2013\u201c Kara can\u2019t stop herself from blurting, and Lena exhales into her collarbone, biting down gently in a way that makes her entire body tingle.\n\u201cWhat happened? In the dreams?\u201d\nLena\u2019s fingers are tracing just under the curve of her breasts, tracing up and over the sides but not yet daring to really touch, and Kara understands suddenly what it is those dreams were telling her. What she wants. What she needs.\nWith a sudden burst of confidence she grasps Lena\u2019s hands and puts them over her breasts, pressing until it makes her gasp.\nEverything accelerates after that.\nLena\u2019s hands are everywhere, and Kara wants them to be even more places, and she barely has time to process the unfathomable pleasure of strong fingers pinching her nipples before Lena is frantically moving south.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never \u2013\u201c Kara gasps as Lena smooths strong hands over her stomach, pulling at the high waist of her underwear. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2013\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d Lena is whispering, and she\u2019s sinking to her knees for reasons Kara can\u2019t fathom. \u201cPlease, let me.\u201d\nAs if Kara could refuse her anything.\nAt Kara\u2019s vehement nod, Lena pulls Kara\u2019s belt from her waist with a snap that makes her shiver and slides the button from her corduroys, easing it all down her legs. She thinks that maybe Lena will stand up again once the task is done, but she doesn\u2019t. She just guides Kara to step one leg out of the garments, and then presses her lips just below Kara\u2019s bellybutton, looking up at her with dark eyes.\n\u201cSpread your legs for me?\u201d\nKara feels a thousand things at once. Nervousness is there, but also excitement \u2013 she feels exposed, raw as a new cut as she eases her legs apart to Lena\u2019s gaze. She feels chest-tightening, breath-stealing affection for the woman currently nuzzling the coarse hairs between her thighs. And, above all, she feels anticipation \u2013 something is about to happen, something new, something transformative. She\u2019s too distracted by sensation to understand what it is; at least, until Lena finally moves lower, spreads something with her fingers, and takes Kara into her mouth.\nThe feeling that arises from a single swipe of Lena\u2019s tongue is borderline euphoric.\nIt\u2019s gentle at first, softness against softness, but at the tail end of it Lena\u2019s tongue brushes a spot that makes something deep inside her jolt awake. It\u2019s like that day with the laundry hamper put under a magnifying glass, made as big as a mountain by Lena\u2019s touch, by her tongue, by her eyes never leaving Kara\u2019s.\n\u201cGosh, Lena,\u201d Kara manages to choke, knowing that her words can\u2019t fully explain exactly what she\u2019s feeling. \u201cI \u2013 gosh. That\u2019s \u2013 you \u2013 can you do that again, please?\u201d\nAnd Lena does. Again and again, until Kara is quaking with the contained force of it. There\u2019s something magical happening at the intersection of pressure and friction, and Kara wants to chase it down. And the reminder that it\u2019s Lena\u2019s tongue that\u2019s doing this to her, her mouth, that she\u2019s drinking Kara in like wine and moaning at the taste, her fingernails leaving crescents in Kara\u2019s hips from the attempts to keep her close \u2013 it\u2019s almost too much. She\u2019s on a train that\u2019s hurtling towards the edge of a cliff, and there\u2019s no jumping off now. She can\u2019t, she won\u2019t.\nLena has a hand on Kara\u2019s stomach, now, her fingers splayed wide over flexing muscle, and Kara reaches down to lace their fingers together, craving the connection, the intimacy of it as she approaches the unknown.\nLena\u2019s hand squeezes, her tongue doubles in it\u2019s lashing over that blissful spot, and Kara\u2019s body seizes as everything comes to its obvious conclusion. There, in Lena\u2019s coat closet with the muffled notes of the Rolling Stones playing over a 4th of July party behind the closed door, Kara has her eureka.\nIt\u2019s like nothing she\u2019s ever known, those seconds of suspended feeling. It\u2019s like a pot boiling over \u2013 it rises and rises until it spills over the sides of her, uncontainable, intense and brief. She couldn\u2019t stop herself from crying out even if she wanted to. It\u2019s involuntary, unstoppable \u2013 she\u2019s so full to the brim with base, primal pleasure that her voice can\u2019t fit anymore. And Lena just groans, just buries her face deeper, her tongue still making sloppy circles as Kara\u2019s world is reshaped.\n\u201cLena,\u201d she finally gasps as the feeling tapers off into something less consuming. \u201cHoly hell.\u201d\nLena laughs sort of disbelievingly.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard you swear before,\u201d Lena mumbles into Kara\u2019s pelvis, as she trails kisses over her hot skin. She can feel that slickness from between her legs smearing over her belly wherever Lena\u2019s mouth goes, and the thought makes her toes curl.\n\u201cWell, this situation sort of called for stronger language,\u201d Kara says breathlessly, and Lena laughs quietly again. \u201cI mean\u2026Lena, gosh.\u201d\nLena\u2019s eyes finally flick up to meet Kara\u2019s, and she looks so sweet and hopeful that Kara\u2019s heart shifts in her chest.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Lena whispers, and Kara wants nothing more than to reassure her that this was the single greatest moment of her life.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never \u2013 I mean, I didn\u2019t know that was possible.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do that since the moment we met,\u201d Lena says quietly, slowly standing up and pressing herself into Kara\u2019s body again. Her mouth is wet, shiny with that between-the-legs slickness Kara has been waking up to for months, and it makes Kara throb as if the last 5 minutes never even happened.\n\u201c\u2026can I - I mean, can you show me how to\u2026\u201d Kara asks haltingly, gesturing vaguely at Lena\u2019s body. She wants in a way she can\u2019t articulate, but Lena seems to understand.\nLena\u2019s breath comes out in a rush, and she tugs Kara closer by her open shirt. \u201cYes, yes, god \u2013\u201c\nAnd then they\u2019re kissing again, and Lena tastes like something deep and unfamiliar \u2013 her, Kara realizes. Lena tastes like her. The thought lights her on fire, and she curses every single day she spent not knowing that this was something she could do.\nRemembering how good it felt to have Lena press her into the door, Kara takes initiative, grabbing at Lena\u2019s hips and spinning them until they\u2019ve switched positions. Her corduroys are still bunched around one ankle, and the reminder of it when she moves her legs to brace against the wood makes her feel tingly.\u00a0\nAnd, Lena\u2019s reaction is overwhelmingly positive. She groans into Kara\u2019s mouth, low and deep, and digs blunt nails into the base of her neck. Kara\u2019s shirt is still hanging open from her shoulders, and she wishes more than anything that Lena was in a similar state.\n\u201cTell me what to do,\u201d Kara pants, biting down on the soft skin of Lena\u2019s throat and feeling it vibrate with her moan. \u201cShow me, again \u2013\u201c\nGrabbing one of Kara\u2019s hands from its place on her hip, Lena guides it until it\u2019s under her dress, Kara\u2019s fingers resting against her underwear - a small, lacy pair, like the kind Kara sometimes blushes to see on mannequins at the mall. It\u2019s damp and sticky, and hot to the touch, and Lena whimpers when she presses down firm.\n\u201cAre you sure you want this?\u201d Lena looks almost wild, her lips swollen and stained and her eyes blown out dramatically. She looks desperate. But she\u2019s stopping to make sure Kara is okay.\nKara has never been more okay in her life.\n\u201cI want you,\u201d Kara murmurs, loving how Lena reacts to the words with bucking hips and a breathy sound. She presses her fingers down harder on wet fabric, not knowing if it\u2019s the right thing to do but gratified at how Lena\u2019s breath hitches. \u201cI want you, I want you \u2013\u201c\nWith her confirmation, Lena hurriedly grabs her hand again, and shoves it into her underwear.\nIt\u2019s a bit of sensory overload, at first. She can feel warm skin on her fingers, and a patch of rough hair, and a hint of wetness \u2013 and then Lena pushes at her knuckles, and her world narrows to slick heat and Lena\u2019s breathless gasp.\nThis is completely unfamiliar terrain. She\u2019s never so much as touched herself here, except for washing \u2013 and whatever magic Lena did when she was on her knees, Kara was too overwhelmed to pay attention. But Lena\u2019s hand is still firm on hers, guiding, and Kara does her best to listen.\nShe wants to make Lena feel it, too.\nHer fingers slip over a swollen spot, a small raised bump, and Lena\u2019s hips jolt like she\u2019s been shocked. It\u2019s so startling that Kara almost pulls her hand away, worried that she\u2019s done something wrong, but Lena just presses her harder.\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 my clit,\u201d Lena gasps, and Kara can feel the nub twitch under her fingers. \u201cFeels \u2013 feels amazing \u2013\u201c\n\nRight. Clit. Good spot. Remember that.\n\nKara slides her fingers across it again, back and forth, and Lena\u2019s eyes practically roll back as her head hits the door with the thud. \u201cKara, fuck \u2013\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s good?\u201d Kara asks, and Lena\u2019s reply comes before she can even finish the short question.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so fucking good \u2013\u201c\nShe\u2019s heard Lena swear before, casually, but not this often, and not this vehemently. It makes her feel hot every time another word falls out of Lena\u2019s mouth \u2013 it\u2019s as if she can\u2019t help it, like the movement of Kara\u2019s hand is forcing them out. The power she feels at being the source of Lena\u2019s pleasure is better than anything she\u2019s ever felt.\nBack and forth her fingers trace, up and down, trying new pressures and patterns and mapping the results, until finally Lena\u2019s shaking hand guides them lower.\n\u201cWant you inside,\u201d Lena pants, and Kara wants to bite at her swollen lip. When she remembers that she can, it lights a firework inside her.\n\u201cWhere?\u201d she asks, capturing Lena\u2019s lip between her teeth and cataloging the frantic sound that results. \u201cI don\u2019t \u2013\u201c\n\u201cMy cunt,\u201d Lena whispers, and the word makes Kara blush harder than anything so far. It\u2019s a word she\u2019s only heard a few times, and it\u2019s certainly not used in polite conversation, but it seems to fit here in a way she can\u2019t explain. It\u2019s harsh, and dirty, and\u2026hot.\nLena pushes at Kara\u2019s hand, and her fingers slip through what feels like an absurd amount of wetness until she finds a spot that gives, and when she presses up and into it \u2013\nShe\u2019s surrounded by Lena, inside her, within her. It\u2019s like the world freezes for just a moment, enough time for Kara\u2019s world to shift once again.\nShe\u2019s at least vaguely familiar with this. This is what Mike was always questing for, this spot, and she\u2019s starting to understand why \u2013 but it was always a bit uncomfortable for her, never something she looked forward to.\nLena doesn\u2019t seem uncomfortable at all.\nIn fact, she just grabs the hem of her dress and pulls until the whole thing comes off over her head, props a still-heeled foot up against the shoe rack, opening herself up to Kara\u2019s hand, and pulls Kara\u2019s mouth to her throat.\nLena is mostly naked, and Kara is mostly naked, and they\u2019re pressed together skin to skin, and Kara is inside her. She\u2019s never felt closer to another person, and it still doesn\u2019t feel close enough.\nHere, at least, Kara has some idea what to do.\nWhen she withdraws her fingers slightly Lena makes a tiny noise of protest, but it turns into a shout of pleasure that Kara is sure the whole party must hear when she plunges them back in, her knuckles pressing hard into the flesh of Lena\u2019s cunt.\nJust thinking the word, so new and forbidden, makes her shiver in the best way.\nThe rhythm of the motion, in and out, gaining speed until Lena\u2019s breasts are bouncing in her fancy brassiere in a way that makes Kara inexplicably want to put them in her mouth, is enough to drive her mad. She can feel Lena approaching that moment, the one she herself just felt, and she\u2019d do anything to help her along \u2013 she just doesn\u2019t know how.\nThankfully, Lena seems to have no problems giving directions.\n\u201cAnother, please, another finger \u2013\u201c Lena begs, and Kara almost dislodges them both in her rush to comply. She slips a third finger inside, and every time Lena makes a one of those satisfied sounds, it feels like she can feel her own actions in an echo against her newly-discovered clit, a spot she hadn\u2019t even known existed until three minutes ago.\nThe thought reminds her of how Lena had reacted, when she dragged her fingers across it. She\u2019s sure that, if she stretches her thumb at just the right angle, she can \u2013\n\u201cKara, fuck!\u201d\nThere it is.\nIt doesn\u2019t take long, after that. Lena\u2019s cries climb in volume and intensity, until she finally peaks with a long, satisfied noise. She can feel her fluttering and pulsing around her fingers, hot and tight, and somehow making Lena feel this way is almost better than feeling it herself.\n\u201cDid you \u2013\u201c Kara asks, wiggling her fingers slightly, and Lena gasps into her neck.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lena hisses, her hips tilting up in a clear indication of more. And Kara wants more. She wants so much.\u00a0\n\u201cCan I \u2013 again -?\u201d Kara asks haltingly, and Lena\u2019s reaction is immediate and enthusiastic.\n\u201cYes, fuck, yes \u2013\u201c\nKara goes by instinct, this time. Lena is too far gone to give much instruction, both her hands now clawing at Kara\u2019s bare back under her open shirt, and she can feel her wrist starting to cramp. But Lena is making those same whimpery noises she did last time, perhaps even more desperate, and it feels like she\u2019s on the absolute razor\u2019s edge of something that Kara is determined to see through.\nFinally, Lena plunges a hand into her hair and makes a fist, pulling on the loose strands in a way that makes the throbbing between Kara\u2019s legs triple in a split second.\n\u201cBite my neck, and \u2013 and curl your fingers \u2013\u201c Lena says, her voice high and tight, and Kara obeys.\n\u201cLike this?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\nWhen Lena tightens around her hand a second time just a few seconds later, Kara feels like she could take on the world. Like a missing piece of herself has just slotted into place, her entire world lighting up, no more dim corners and shadowy places. Everything is illuminated by Lena, coming on her fingers, again and again. This is what life really feels like.\nLena is crying and kissing her and, how did she ever live without this? Without Lena hot and wet on her hand, her tongue in her mouth, pressed together as tightly as two people can be pressed, like two halves of an oyster shell?\nKara is pretty sure it isn\u2019t just Lena\u2019s tears she\u2019s tasting in their kisses.\n\u201cKara\u2026\u201d Lena whispers brokenly, both hands cupping her face as she presses her lips to every inch of bare skin. \u201cChrist, Kara \u2013\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t see this before,\u201d Kara whispers back, her fingers still buried deep in a heat she never wants to leave. Her voice is shaky, but sure. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been blind my whole life.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t explain it to you. You must have been so confused,\u201d Lena says with a wet laugh.\n\u201cI was. I\u2019ve never felt like this before. Never ever. I had no idea what all this commotion was,\u201d Kara says with a smile, poking at her own chest with her free hand. Lena laughs again, and it feels healing.\n\u201cI was so scared you would hate me, if I told you,\u201d Lena sighs, stroking her fingers down Kara\u2019s temple and across her jaw. She traces over Kara\u2019s lips, so gentle that it almost tickles, and Kara nips at her fingertips, making both of them smile.\n\u201cNot possible,\u201d Kara says, and Lena\u2019s smile fades a bit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s happened before. And with you it would have been so much worse, because I \u2013\u201c\nLena cuts herself off, looking startled at her own almost-admission. But Kara\u2019s heart skipped a beat at the possibilities that sentence opened up, and she can\u2019t let it slip by.\n\u201cBecause, what?\u201d Kara asks gently, and Lena shakes her head, her lips tight.\n\u201cI\u2019m still scared,\u201d Lena admits in a small voice, and Kara tries to erase the fear by kissing her again, deep and slow.\n\u201cTell me,\u201d she whispers as their lips part, Lena\u2019s eyes easing slowly open. \u201cPlease?\u201d\n\u201cIt would have been worse because I think I love you.\u201d\nLena says it quickly, quietly, as if she\u2019s ripping off a band-aid, bracing for a bad reaction. But what Kara feels in response is nothing but pure, unfiltered joy.\nLena loves her. And Kara loves Lena right back.\nKara lets out a sound, half-laugh and half-sob, at just how true those words feel.\nShe\u2019s never felt this kind of love before. Years of marriage and two years of dating prior, and she and Mike had never so much as said it to each other. She loves Alex, sure, and Eliza, and she loved her parents, but romantic love seemed like a thing that was made up for the movies. That squirrelly, desperate, lets-go-to-Niagara-Falls-and-elope feeling always felt like a lie.\nBut if Lena asked, she\u2019d hop in a car right now and head north.\n\u201cI thought I could keep my distance,\u201d Lena is saying, sounding worried. \u201cKeep it light. I flirted and you always seemed to respond, but I didn\u2019t want to hope. But it grew, god, it grew so big and that day in the pool I just realized it was more. You were more.\u201d\nKara isn\u2019t sure how Lena can still sound worried when she herself can\u2019t stop smiling.\n\u201cYou\u2019re more, too. More than I\u2019ve ever felt,\u201d Kara says, and Lena\u2019s face brightens immediately.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\nMike\u2019s angry face flashes in Kara\u2019s mind, and Alex\u2019s, happy and wild with the knowledge of her new self, and then Lena\u2019s. Right now, flushed and hopeful and just a little bit nervous.\n\u201cYeah. And\u2026I think I love you, too.\u201d\nLena practically deflates in relief, the air leaving her in a long groan as she leans forward to rest her forehead on Kara\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cOh, thank god,\u201d Lena mumbles, and Kara laughs, full to the brim with happiness. She kisses Lena\u2019s temple until they\u2019re both smiling, and finally, she slips her fingers free from the warmth they\u2019ve been buried in this whole time. She was so content there that she\u2019d almost forgotten, and Lena did too, based on her surprised intake of breath as Kara\u2019s hand comes to rest just a bit further up. She runs her wet fingers through the hair there, and remembers how Lena had nuzzled at her own.\nIt makes her want to drop to her knees, like Lena did, and keep on learning.\nBut outside there\u2019s the telltale thump and shatter of something breaking, and a chorus of drunken laughter, and she remembers where she is.\nKara doesn\u2019t want to leave this closet yet. She doesn\u2019t want to face the real world, with all its harshness. She just wants to stay right here, let contentment fill her up with every meeting of their lips. But the party still rages outside, and Mike still lies next door sleeping and unaware, and there are things that have to be dealt with. Everything else can come after.\nMany, many times after.\nLena\u2019s light dims a little when Kara says she has to go, even with the reassurance that she\u2019s only going to get her things and make sure Mike gets her letter. She\u2019d be willing to just take off, ride into the sunset with Lena and damn the consequences, if it weren\u2019t for the few precious belongings she can\u2019t bear to leave behind. And Mike, for all his faults, at least deserves to know that she\u2019s leaving, if only so he doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s just gone missing.\nKara slips out the front door as Lena shuts off the music and starts to usher people out, announcing that the party is over, and when she unlocks her own door, she\u2019s strangely aware of the fact that this is probably the last time she\u2019ll ever do it.\nWhen she flicks the light switch in the kitchen, it feels like someone else\u2019s house. Someone else\u2019s life. She knows she needs to be quick and quiet, and yet Kara paces the kitchen like a woman possessed, full of manic energy. It\u2019s as if Lena was a battery, and now she\u2019s charged up, full of lightning and love. NASA be damned, she feels like she could jump high enough to hit the moon.\nAnd Mike is still upstairs, sleeping through the most earth-shaking night of Kara\u2019s life. He\u2019s going to wake up to a whole new world, one where Kara will be gone. She\u2019s done with this life, now. This house, this relationship, has brought her nothing but misery.\nShe sets her letter and ring on the pillow, and feels no remorse. She\u2019s ready for her new start.\nShe grabs the things she most needs \u2013 her emergency money and banking paperwork, photos of her family, the book with the polaroids that Lena gave her \u2013 and leaves everything else behind. All her old clothes, her kitchen things, all the knickknacks that Mike has bought her as gifts over the years that she felt no connection to. All of it is dust to her.\nThe only important thing is Lena, who opens her door with a brilliant smile, who accepts Kara\u2019s hug with surprise, as if she wasn\u2019t fully expecting Kara to come back at all.\n\u201cI rang Sam,\u201d Lena says a little breathlessly, as Kara sets her little box of belongings down on the entry table. \u201cShe said we can come stay with her at her lake house, for a while. Until things settle down.\u201d Lena pitches the idea like Kara might refuse. Like Kara wouldn\u2019t follow her to the ends of the earth if she asked.\nShe can see Lena\u2019s suitcase, packed and ready, sitting next to the door. Lena is in this, just as much as she is, as difficult as that is to believe.\nKara grins, pulling Lena \u2013 her girl, her sweetheart, her lover \u2013 by the hands until they\u2019re close enough to share breath. Until she can press their lips together, losing herself in the softness of Lena\u2019s mouth.\nWhen they part for air, she smiles her first free smile.\n\u201cI could go for a vacation.\u201d\nBut it doesn\u2019t feel like a vacation, when they\u2019re on the highway with the convertible top down, Lena\u2019s hair tucked under a headscarf and Kara\u2019s blowing loose in the wind. The stars get brighter the further they get from the suburbs, and the wind is just cool enough to be comfortable after the heat of the summer day. Lena is happy and beautiful, their hands are intertwined over the gearshift, and every few minutes she looks over at Kara like she can\u2019t quite believe she\u2019s really here.\nNo, it doesn\u2019t feel like a vacation. It feels like, after a lifetime of being kept away, she\u2019s finally heading home.\n\u00a0"
