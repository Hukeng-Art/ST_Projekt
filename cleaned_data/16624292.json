    "text": "Her name was Paisley and Matt was doing his not to hate her because it wasn\u2019t her fault that they were where they were.\nIt was Mr. Kline from fucking church\u2019s, with his entitled, holier than thou nose in the air and if Matt was being honest, it wasn\u2019t even him, technically. It was the even more entitled, even holier than thou Mrs. Kline.\nAnd okay, maybe it was a teensy bit his own fault, but really there was absolutely no need to call the police.\nHe hadn\u2019t been jumping off the roof, he\u2019d been jumping on to the roof. But it wasn\u2019t like he could just come out and say that to the officers trying to talk him off the ledge he had very happily perched himself on.\nHe probably should have changed his clothes.\nScratch that, he definitely should have changed his clothes.\nBut sometimes you just gotta evacuate church and all the sins you\u2019ve been stewing in for the last year or so for some air, alright? And sometimes you just gotta do that shit as soon as possible because a second more in the presence of the Lord and you were sure you were gonna erupt into flames right then and there.\nBut that\u2019s besides the point. The point is Paisley.\nThe point is fucking Mrs. Kline who called the police who talked to him like a child for half an hour before grabbing him by the scruff of the neck and manhandling him off the roof and right into a 5150 hold in his damn church clothes. They didn\u2019t let him call anyone and ignored his very rational arguments about how he was definitely not suicidal.\nThat all went to hell anyways when the hospital opened his medical file and whoops, hi fifteen-year-old Matty, hey do me a favor and go get fucked, would ya?\nUgh.\nHindsight is 20-20, even for a blind guy.\nUgh.\nEven Fogs couldn\u2019t do too much to help him when this came to light and Matt didn\u2019t need to see Foggy\u2019s horrified face upon learning this information to know how heartbroken he was. Matt hadn\u2019t told him. Hadn\u2019t told anybody since, really. Sister Maggie knew, Father Lantom knew, half his orphanage pals had known. Matt had just been a fucked up kid, it was part of a long line of fucked up things he\u2019d done.\nBut that was then, and this is now, and he was a grown-ass man who\u2019d only maybe attempted suicide like once this whole year and it was totally under duress, he\u2019d gotten through it, it was fine.\nThe state psychologist asked him if he\u2019d attempted anything since he was fifteen and he lied with this in mind like a professional.\nAnd yet, somehow, she caught him dead and that was just embarrassing to everyone involved and anyways.\nNow he had a dog.\nShe was allegedly a very good girl. Matt\u2019s new social workers told her that she was a very good girl. A very smart girl. What a good girl.\nLies.\nShe jumped on him and leaned on him and put her cold-ass nose in his lap and he needed to find someone to pawn this creature off onto before he went insane.\nFogs kept trying to tell him some shit about this being her job, but Matt wasn\u2019t an idiot. Paisley was a guide dog. And she wore a harness he refused to touch and she panted like it was her job to fill every room with her hot, nasty-ass kibble-breath. She was constantly at his side and would not leave him the hell alone and he didn\u2019t need a guide dog and no one was fucking listening to him anymore. Just like before.\nSocial Services always did this shit. Had always done this shit.\nHe demanded to see their written definition of high-risk and he wanted to bring a suit against them for discrimination, but it was to no avail.\n\u201cMr. Murdock, we are trying to help you,\u201d they all said.\n\u201cThen take the fucking dog,\u201d he told them.\n\u201cMr. Murdock, you\u2019ve had a very difficult life,\u201d they told him, \u201cAnd there is no shame in using support when you need it.\u201d\n\u201cI know. I have a fucking stick,\u201d he told them. \u201cSo take the goddamn dog before I poison it.\u201d\nAnd fuck a duck, it turned out that the mutilation of and fantasy of mutilating animals was apparently a sign of psychopathy?\nSo now he had to go to another shrink to convince them that he didn\u2019t actually want to kill the damn thing, he just wanted it out of his house and life, and while he was at it, everyone else could fuck right off too, please and thanks.\nPaisley laid out all over him during this meeting and the psychiatrist didn\u2019t even move a muscle. Her heartbeat was dead even and Matt could not for the life of him understand why no one ever did anything about this.\n\u201cStop,\u201d he barked at the dog. He tried to shove her away but she was persistent.\n\u201cWould you\u2014just stop,\u201d he growled. Paisley settled for licking his hand and shoving her face into his lap. She only stopped this business upon receiving pets. She was so desperate for pets, like, all the time. Matt was pretty sure that guide dogs were supposed to be obedient and at least somewhat restrained in this nonsense.\n\u201cMr. Murdock,\u201d The shrink said slowly, observing him waging war with the dog, \u201cYou are aware that Paisley is a\u00a0psychiatric service dog, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nA what?\n\u201cA what?\u201d he asked.\nThe gal\u2019s heart flipped over in surprise.\nOh. He didn\u2019t like that.\n\u201cA psychiatric service dog,\u201d she repeated. \u201cDid no one tell you she\u2019s a\u00a0psychiatric service dog?\u201d\nA weird way to say \u2018guide dog\u2019 but whatever.\n\u201cYeah, sure. Psych, guide, whatever you want to call her\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a guide dog.\u201d\nThe dog huffed in Matt\u2019s lap and nibbled at his fingers when he stopped petting her.\nNot a guide dog?\nThey hadn\u2019t even given him a guide dog?\nWhat the fuck kind of incompetent\u2014\n\u201cMr. Murdock you have significant childhood trauma, on top of what appears to me and your other clinician to be escalating self-harm behaviors. Social Services recommended the dog for those issues, Mr. Murdock. Not for your blindness.\u201d\nWait. He wasn\u2019t understanding.\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t need psych support?\u201d he tried.\nThe silence that followed this was in turn followed by the rough application of pen to paper.\nAh, fuck.\nThis was not going well.\n\u201cI already have a support network,\u201d he corrected, \u201cI\u2019ve got my friend group and my work and church. I have more support than I know what to do with, I don\u2019t need a dog on top of all that.\u201d\nThe pen continued.\nJesus.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we do this,\u201d the therapist said evenly, her heart just as level, \u201cIt is clear to me that you aren\u2019t actually planning on harming Miss Paisley over here. It seems to me that this is a period of adjustment. Have you ever had a pet before, Mr. Murdock?\u201d\nHoney, the closest thing he\u2019d ever had to a pet was Wade Wilson. And he was pretty sure that that admission wasn\u2019t going to get him out of this office any faster.\n\u201cNo?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I see. It can be difficult getting used to sharing space and having another being in your life suddenly dependent on you. Especially if you\u2019ve never done it before. Why don\u2019t you give it two weeks? Two weeks to see if Paisley improves your mood or helps you in other parts of your life? I\u2019ll recommend some additional information and maybe some specialized training for both of you, and if you don\u2019t find her to be helpful after all that, then we\u2019ll look into other possibilities. Is that fair?\u201d\nNo, ma\u2019am, it was not. Matt had already had Paisley for five days and he was at the end of his rope.\nPaisley licked his face and he couldn\u2019t contain his noise of disgust.\nHe could have sworn the shrink was laughing at him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFoggy would not stop baby-talking the goddamned dog. Karen was spoiling the damn dog with all kinds of shit tired-Matt was a-fucking-mazing at tripping over.\nPeter was wholeheartedly in love with the dog. He and his little buddies called her two billion names which she had done nothing to earn. They showered her in praise and affection when she wasn\u2019t wearing her harness, which, Matt learned, was red service vest.\nHe\u2019d been wondering why no one had given him guide dog training. He\u2019d tried it once as a kid, but, embarrassingly, had been so terrified of the dogs that his dad had had to intervene and take him aside to settle down for a while. He didn\u2019t want to talk about it.\nNaturally, Foggy and Karen laid on him until it came out.\n\u201cMatty, why didn\u2019t you just say you\u2019re scared of dogs?\u201d Foggy asked him, having gone from delighted to concerned in a matter of seconds.\n\u201cI\u2019m not scared of them,\u201d he defended. Paisley got up to shove her muzzle into his hand. When ignored, she squirmed her head in under his elbow and made him jump.\nKaren and Foggy\u2019s silence was judgmental.\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThey\u2019re big and hairy and messy and they smell bad.\u201d\nAnd Dad had had to pick him up into his arms at nine years old and bounce him a little like a toddler because he\u2019d been inconsolable that one time.\n\u201cDid you get mauled?\u201d Karen asked.\n\u201cWhat? No.\u201d\n\u201cBit?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cUh, chased?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cThen what gives?\u201d Karen pressed.\nHe shrugged hard.\n\u201cMatty, it\u2019s okay to just be scared of them,\u201d Foggy told him kindly.\n\u201cI\u2019m not scared of them.\u201d\nThat silence was so judgmental, were they even trying?\n\u201cOkay, sure,\u201d Fogs blew out with a sigh.\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I heard you. Maybe it would help if you guys bonded. Maybe take her to a park? Let her be off-duty for a little bit? You never know, she might have the compatible personality to yours.\u201d\nTake her? Off lead?\nWhat if she fucked off and didn\u2019t come back? Social Services would definitely think he\u2019d killed her. 100%, without a doubt.\nWas he fast enough to catch a dog? Maybe. Maybe if she was old. He considered the beast demanding pets. He didn\u2019t understand what was wrong with Fogs\u2019s or Karen\u2019s pets that she always seemed to come back to him.\n\u201cMaybe, and bear with me, Matty,\u201d Foggy said. Matt knew what he was going to say before he even said it and hissed at him. \u201cRight, see, you\u2019re not bearing with me.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I get that. But maybe she\u2019ll be less annoying to you if she\u2019s serving a different function. You just hate her right now because she\u2019s trying to make you reflect on the emotional disaster that is your head. You hate everyone who does that, but don\u2019t you think she might help you, I dunno, chill out a bit with the other stuff? You told me before it\u2019s kind of a relief to just use the cane sometimes, right?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cMatthew.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nHe would not bear this indignity.\n\u201cMatthew, I swear to god you told me that.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cDude,\u201d Karen interrupted, \u201cJust shut up and try it.\u201d\nUgh.\n\u00a0\nPaisley was a very good girl, a very smart girl, according to literally everyone everywhere. But Paisley was not a guide dog and she, nor Matt, had sufficient guide dog training. So he tamped down the urge to vomit and called his social worker and arranged a meeting with her and his new clinician and pointed at the dog.\n\u201cIf this is going to happen,\u201d he said, \u201cI want a guide dog. Not an emotional support one.\u201d\nPaisley leaned her head on his knee. The other two people in the room where puzzled, given their jumping heart beats and head scratching.\n\u201cWell, alright?\u201d the social worker said.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter legitimately cried upon learning that Paisley was going away to be replaced with a different dog and he refused to speak to Matt for days. Which was what the fuck ever. It wasn\u2019t the kid\u2019s life. He wasn\u2019t the one who had to deal with the dog day in and day out.\n\u201cRed, go say sorry,\u201d Wade told him after the second week of Peter calling out of their meet up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d Matt snapped back. \u201cI didn\u2019t even want her to begin with.\u201d\nWade was unmoved. But also a cat-dad now, no matter how much he denied it. And Matt was so jealous. Why couldn\u2019t he have a guide cat? He\u2019d allow for a guide cat. He wouldn\u2019t even have to train it, he\u2019d be totally cool with just carrying it around on his shoulders.\nActually.\nWhy couldn\u2019t he have an emotional support cat??\n\u201cDude, what\u2019s with that face?\u201d\nHe tried to find Wade.\n\u201cCan I borrow Bella?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Wade snipped back, then realized what he was letting onto and backtracked. \u201cI mean, yeah, whatever. Take her. Bake her. Do whatever you want. See if I care.\u201d\nSo that was a no.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTuesday was a good girl. A very good girl. A much better girl than Paisley, if simply by merit of not laying all over the place where Matt could trip on her. Tuesday did not drool all over Matt\u2019s hands and didn\u2019t shove her nose where it didn\u2019t belong.\nTuesday was smart. And Matt appreciated intelligence in a person, so he and Tuesday jived a lot better than him and Paisley.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna say it,\u201d Foggy threatened.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking say a word,\u201d Matt threatened back.\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m gonna say it.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear you.\u201d\n\u201cYou like her.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cMatty, you like her.\u201d\n\u201cI do nothing of the sort.\u201d\nTuesday huffed a sigh next to his knee and laid down, almost bored. She didn\u2019t whine or bark or nuzzle. She left him be until he told her what to do.\nTuesday was really good at fetching things Matt didn\u2019t know he needed fetched. She could bring him his cane, for example. Which was very handy when he lost it, having chucked it or dropped it somewhere in an alley or in a pile of shit on his floor. She could bring him a bottle of meds, like aspirin or antibiotics. She was especially good at finding curbs before Matt could and listened to him when he told her to go places. Most importantly, however, Tuesday was really, really good at ignoring all the shit that distracted Matt on the way down the street.\nHe\u2019d tested it.\nYes, maybe a ridiculous competition to hold, especially given that Tuesday was a guide dog, not a sniffer dog, but whatever. She was smart. She\u2019d already memorized the way to the office and had learned how to fetch the first aid kit. And he\u2019d only had her for nine days.\nHe had faith in her.\nSo Matt wandered through the streets, pinpointing all the smells and sounds which might be dog-attractive, and which were certainly Matt-attractive. Then, he strategically dropped a cane at the very end of the busiest street and went back to stand over Tuesday in her harness in the kitchen.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he told her, \u201cLet\u2019s see what you got.\u201d\nHe took her down the front steps and took off her harness and instructed her to fetch the cane, holding out one of his spares as a reference. She didn\u2019t want to leave him, which was kind of endearing (not that he\u2019d ever, not once in his life, admit that out loud), but on the third command she took the order and went huffing down the street, on the hunt for the cane. He trailed the dog. Why? Because. How else was he supposed to know how good she was?\nThe dog did not pause in her business, except to relocate Matt\u2019s scent when she lost it, which was more than Matt could say for himself sometimes. He was prone to weaving a little, with and without the cane, not a lot, but especially when he was tired and someone was cooking something nice or was blasting shit out of their car speakers. It was somewhat unconscious but could be rectified by upping his alertness.\nTuesday, however, was good and alert on her own. She kept her nose down and huffed along, all the way to the end of the sidewalk, where she snuffled around the dumpster Matt had tossed the cane under. She picked it up in her gentle mouth and started a happy jog back towards the apartment door. Matt had to jog a bit to keep up with her on the parallel street until she froze halfway down the block.\nHe tried to sense around for what had distracted her but was too far away to figure out if it had been a smell or a sound or something in her peripheral vision.\nThen the clicking of paws and panting started coming his way, and he realized it was him. He\u2019d distracted her. She must have caught sight or smell of him scampering between the alleys.\nShe came right up to him and nudged the cane into his hand.\nHe didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\u201cGood dog?\u201d he tried, patting her head a little. She leaned into the pat and then took up her position by his leg, even though she wasn\u2019t wearing the harness.\n\u201cGood girl,\u201d he said more emphatically. They returned to the building.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMatty, I know you\u2019re really into this whole, I-hate-her business, but man, you\u2019re cooing,\u201d Foggy noted from the couch.\nMatt released Tuesday\u2019s face immediately and sat up straight.\nHe was not cooing.\nHe didn\u2019t not coo.\nNot at babies. Not at dogs. Not at anything.\nNo cooing.\nTuesday gave a tiny whine at the sudden loss of affection and then settled back down at his feet.\nShe was such a good girl. So little whining. So little protest.\nOkay, maybe just one more pet. She was a good girl, she\u2019d been a good girl all day. She deserved another pet.\n\u201cMatty.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not even doing anything,\u201d he griped, ruffling Tuesday\u2019s ears so that she shook her head and panted a couple times before settling back down.\nFoggy didn\u2019t say anything, but Matt could sense him watching.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t know what to make of Tuesday because she was so different from her predecessor. She didn\u2019t acknowledge him or his friends the first time they met her.\n\u201cIs she sick?\u201d Peter asked. Matt raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cNo. She\u2019s just chill,\u201d he said.\nPeter did not understand why this was a merit in a dog.\n\u201cShe seems sad,\u201d he said.\nMatt hummed and stood up, and up came Tuesday next to him.\n\u201cFogs, we\u2019re going to the park,\u201d he called over his shoulder; the kids followed him and Tuesday out the door.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTuesday was happy to be let out of her harness and temporarily off duty. She shook her shaggy fur and bounced off for a quick trot around the grass.\n\u201cDoes she fetch?\u201d Ned asked.\nMatt considered.\n\u201cKind of?\u201d he offered. He hadn\u2019t gotten her a ball or anything. She as an ace at fetching gauze, though. She licked at his wounds sometimes too, which was nasty but also kind of sweet.\u00a0\n\u201cDoes she know the Devil?\u201d Peter asked, flopping down onto the bench next to Matt.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, kid. Why\u2019s it matter?\u201d\n\u201cAre you gonna keep her?\u201d MJ tossed in.\nGo away. Don\u2019t ask hard questions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in our trial period, don\u2019t be putting ideas into her head.\u201d\nTuesday came back to nudge at Matt\u2019s hand for pets. Peter took over to give her far too many and far too vigorous pets, which got her all good and riled up. She even barked once, then sneezed on the kid to his vociferous disgust and wagged her tail merrily at his misery.\nFuck, he wanted to keep her.\nFuck. This was exactly why Dad never let him have any pets.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSpidey says he liked your old dog better,\u201d Wade noted in the direction of Tuesday\u2019s placid form in Matt\u2019s kitchen.\n\u201c\u2019Course he did, he does emotion,\u201d Matt told him.\nWade peered at the dog in silence for a few beats.\n\u201cDo you feel more stable, Red?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr are we still at ultimate martyr levels?\u201d\nHe returned to sinking the needle into Matt\u2019s skin while he thought about it.\nTuesday sighed under the table and swept her tail out of the way of Matt\u2019s feet. It brushed against his ankles as it went.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe therapist was fucking smug and he didn\u2019t like it, not one bit.\n\u201cYou seem to be in a good mood today, Mr. Murdock,\u201d she noted.\nHe didn\u2019t answer because he didn\u2019t need that kind of language in his life.\n\u201cHow are we finding Miss Tuesday?\u201d\nHe said nothing. Tuesday said nothing either.\n\u201cI see,\u201d said the therapist, making a note in her book. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s okay to say that she makes you more comfortable.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t need Tuesday to be comfortable. He\u2019d been comfortable enough on his own. It was just kind of nice to not wander around alone all the time. That was all.\n\u201cI take it we\u2019ll be finishing out the month with her?\u201d\nWhat if he got too attached?\nWas he already too attached?\nHe should say no, he should give her up. He didn\u2019t need her, he wanted her. They were different things.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSister Maggie did not like Tuesday, but then, Sister Maggie did not like dogs, period.\nIt was absurd but he had to bite down on his tongue to keep himself from telling her, \u2018no, but Tuesday\u2019s different. She\u2019s a good dog.\u2019\nTuesday didn\u2019t jump on anyone or give un-asked-for kisses or anything dumb like that. Tuesday already knew the way to the office and gave Matt a few extra moments of peace in the morning, before he had to get ahold of himself and start locking things down and filtering them to get through the day. Tuesday didn\u2019t let him walk over curbs when he wasn\u2019t paying attention. Tuesday wasn\u2019t scared of the Devil,\u00a0 but she didn\u2019t like him getting into Matt\u2019s space without being able to sniff his fingers to make sure it was really just him coming home.\nShe was a really good girl.\nShe was a really big help.\nWhen he woke up at night, breathing hard, she was laying on the ground by the bed and the sound of another heartbeat brought him back to reality faster. That feeling of emptiness, followed by the urge to swallow down the breaths and put the falling, sinking feeling behind him weren\u2019t gone, but they felt different.\nWhen she wasn\u2019t working, Tuesday followed him around the apartment and wagged her big, plume-like tail slowly when he talked to her, as if she was actually listening.\nShe didn\u2019t mind him meditating for long periods of time and didn\u2019t get in his face while he was doing it.\nShe didn\u2019t ask him if he was really blind.\nShe didn\u2019t bother him about why it was that he could find things at home, but not find the same things or do the same things outside.\n\u201cAre you going to keep her?\u201d Sister Maggie asked as Tuesday received permission to be get lots of pets from all the orphanage kids.\nMatt chewed his lips.\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d\nSister Maggie hummed.\n\u201cDoes she make you happy?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need her,\u201d Matt said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter was trying to make friends with Tuesday, but it wasn\u2019t going well for him. Matt suspected it was because Peter wanted to play like she was a puppy, when Tuesday was basically an old maid. She wasn\u2019t terribly interested in getting all worked up and jumping all over him and, from Foggy\u2019s descriptions, preferred to observe Pete\u2019s efforts at throwing tennis balls and waving toys in her face with faint disinterest.\n\u201cMatty, you are allowed to like her,\u201d Foggy told him as they took in Peter\u2019s attempts to play fetch. Tuesday duped Peter by showing interest in the ball, barking just an eensy bit. Foggy narrated as she watched Pete chuck it, overhand into the middle of the green, then barked softly after it and turned a few circles before laying back down, plume a-wagging.\nPeter explained to the dog for the third time how fetch works. She stopped wagging to listen to him attentively but made no move whatsoever to act on his excited instruction to go get the ball. She would not be moved. Peter huffed at her and she watched him stomp off to go fetch the ball with a cocked ear. Fogs said the cocked ear was very important.\nMatt didn\u2019t tell Pete that Tuesday\u2019s idea of fun was mouthing all the tennis balls in the pet store and then guarding the one she picked like it was an egg. He didn\u2019t feel like trying to make eye contact with Fogs either.\nFogs sighed and leaned back and wrapped an arm around Matt\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cBuddy, why do you always make things so hard on yourself?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need her,\u201d Matt reminded him, or maybe himself.\n\u201cPal, you have been so much more chill over the last couple weeks, I don\u2019t think you even realize it.\u201d\nNo, he did. But that wasn\u2019t the point.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need her,\u201d he maintained.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTuesday found her best friend and her best friend was Max, to Frank\u2019s absolute horror. Matt didn\u2019t really mind, it was entertaining to track Frank\u2019s fidgeting and frantically whispered whys.\nMax was much more puppyish than Tuesday; he liked to get all riled up and come over and lean on her and shove her until she\u2019d stand up and wag her plume a bit. And then Max would double his dumbass pitty efforts and get to wriggling and barking and nudging and making weird half-growls half-whines, and Frank would put his head in his hands and ask the universe why his dog was such a fucking dweeb.\nKaren told Matt that he no longer had any choice in the matter. It was an act of animal cruelty to separate best friends.\nIt was, well.\nIt was an excuse to say yes. To say okay. To say she\u2019ll stay.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe went to Elektra because he needed advice that only she could give and she sat with him quietly while they listened to the rain. Tuesday stayed quiet and close, settled down at Matt\u2019s feet as he and Elektra sat on opposite ends of the couch in her apartment. Legs outstretched, entwined comfortably in each other.\nIt wasn\u2019t sexy anymore so much as it was a meaningful connection. They didn\u2019t have to talk anymore, it seemed.\n\u201cSensei would have said no,\u201d Elektra said into the hush. Matt dropped his face to his knees.\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need her. You just want her.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you want her?\u201d\nA hard question to answer.\n\u201cI think she brings me comfort.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe hush and then the rain.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need comfort,\u201d Elektra said gently. Tuesday shifted position and sighed into her paws.\nMatt sighed with her. He sniffed.\n\u201cMatthew,\u201d Elektra hummed.\nHe sniffed again, couldn\u2019t help it. She was right.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not listening,\u201d she said. \u201cHey.\u201d She nudged him, her knee against his. He tipped his face heavenward and blinked hard to keep the tears from falling. \u201cHey, listen to me,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d he told her, trying to clear his throat. She pressed their knees together.\n\u201cSensei isn\u2019t here anymore,\u201d she said, and then stopped for a long moment. \u201cI think that means we\u2019re allowed to choose who we get to be. Get to choose what we need.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s weakness,\u201d he replied. He sniffed again. The dog twitched up in his direction.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s happiness,\u201d Elektra murmured.\nHe hiccupped. Tuesday rustled up to her feet and laid her head against the knee closest to her.\n\u201cI want to keep her,\u201d he confided. \u201cShe makes things easier.\u201d\nElektra leaned forward and cupped her hand over the knee Tuesday wasn\u2019t leaning on. Her hand was warm.\n\u201cThen keep her,\u201d she said. Matt heard her swallow. She didn\u2019t like to see him cry. The same way his heart throbbed in pain when she did.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he hiccupped. She shifted and pressed more of their legs together.\n\u201cIf something happens, I\u2019ll take her,\u201d she decided. \u201cAnd if something happens to me, we\u2019ll get Castle to.\u201d\nBecause, all joking aside, Frank would. He definitely would.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he sobbed.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFoggy was concerned and Tuesday was concerned and restless. Matt always seemed to go to Foggy after being with Elektra. As if touching them both back to back would make things more solid.\n\u201cBuddy, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Foggy asked, \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been crying, huh? What\u2019s up?\u201d\nHe could comfortably break down in Foggy\u2019s arms, no need to hold back, to keep the quiet like with Elektra.\n\u201cI wanna keep the dog,\u201d he got out between breaths.\nFoggy pulled away a little in surprise. He didn\u2019t understand why this was important. He didn\u2019t understand why it was so hard. But he was Foggy, so he wrapped his arms around Matt\u2019s back and rocked them both a bit.\n\u201cThen keep the dog, honey,\u201d he said. Matt laughed into his neck; it was hot and damp with his own upset. Foggy ran his hands in long, firm circles over his back.\nIt was allowed to be as simple as that.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMatt\u2019s landlord just about bent over backwards trying to tell him he wasn\u2019t allowed to have a dog in his apartment and Matt could have sworn that even Tuesday stopped her grooming to stare blankly at the guy.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a service dog?\u201d Matt tried, because cutting through this stupidity was like wading through shit when there was a perfectly good bridge built over it.\n\u201cNo pets,\u201d the guy reminded him, \u201cIt says so in the tenancy agreement.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s. A. Service. Dog,\u201d Matt explained, extra slow for the folks in the back.\n\u201cMr. Murdock\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDude, I\u2019m fucking blind, I don\u2019t know what you want here. You can file a suit if that\u2019s really how you want to go about this, but like, it ain\u2019t gonna work out well for you. I\u2019m allowed to have a service dog, that\u2019s kind of how this works.\u201d\n\u201cNo pets.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, man, if that\u2019s the hill you wanna die on, I\u2019m not gonna stop you from trying.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWade was charmed right out of his mind over this.\n\u201cDoes he even know who you are?\u201d he pressed. Matt shrugged. A lot of people in the Kitchen were familiar with Nelson &amp; Murdock and just Murdock &amp; Murdock, but he didn\u2019t exactly go out of his way to scream his name from the mountain tops.\n\u201cHe\u2019s gonna get his ass kicked. You got a back-up place to live for when he inevitably evicts you?\u201d Wade asked.\nMatt shrugged again.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got no grounds to evict me, but he can try that too. I mean, if he\u2019s that desperate for me to use his own money to pay my rent, I\u2019m not gonna stop him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFoggy bought Tues a wooden box to keep her three prized tennis balls in and she decided that he was allowed to stay and took to leaning on his legs when she was off-duty. Foggy decided that they were distant blond cousins and that the human Tues had been reincarnated from must have been the gentlest 18th century Irish woman in all the land.\nHe took to asking her stupid questions like \u201cis the heather soft on the moors today, Tues?\u201d and \u201chow\u2019re the sheep, my dear?\u201d which was adorable, and which Matt wasn\u2019t going to deal with because it made him all soft inside.\nKaren took the opposite approach and addressed Tuesday only as \u201cmy bitch\u201d and \u201cmy ho.\u201d\nPeter and MJ were mortified upon witnessing this in action. Ned thought it was hilarious because Karen had also taught the dog how to high-five upon receiving these greetings.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe said nothing to the social worker or the therapist staring at him expectantly. He had nothing to say to them. Well. He should probably say thanks, but he wasn\u2019t thrilled about the prospect. If it weren\u2019t for them, he wouldn\u2019t be currently stuck terrorizing his landlord.\n\u201cI take it that that\u2019s a yes?\u201d the therapist finally asked.\nTuesday sighed next to his feet.\nWould it be overkill if he said he\u2019d die for her and he\u2019d murder anyone who so much as blinked at her with any malice?\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said simply.\n\u201cAnd have you noted any improvement in your, uh, quality of\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s far better than that horrible thing you all first saddled me with.\u201d\nThe two women turned towards each other to share a silent conversation.\n\u201cAlright, well. That\u2019s great then,\u201d the social worker said. \u201cSo we can move forward with all the adoption paperwork?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u00a0"
