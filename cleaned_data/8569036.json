    "notes": "<p>I\u2019ve become fascinated with the bazillion versions of Krypton that exist within the world of the comics. The show\u2019s presented us with an interesting society, one that\u2019s got a lot of culture and passion, but also one that\u2019s clearly rigid in its views on love and marriage. Some versions of Superman present Kryptonian relationships as ruled by the \u201cgood matches\u201d described above and reproduction is based on compatibility within the Matrix/Codex/It\u2019s got about 18 different names and all the wiki articles I read were confusing. I liked this but of them though, because it seemed to really jive with the non-familial relationships Kara holds closest to her within the show\u2019s canon. Winn is incredibly smart and technically savvy, James is a well-renowned photographer with several prestigious awards, Lucy\u2019s a high ranking military official, Cat is arguably the most powerful woman in all of popular media, and Lena, while new, also is in a position of great clout within National City. These are people who would be considered \u201cgood matches\u201d across the board, people that Kryptonian society, as I\u2019ve imagined it, would approve of Kara having and maintaining relationships with.</p>\n<p>So this is a story that talks about Kara\u2019s regret and grief over losing James, but also about her growing comfortable with someone else.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Thanks for coming a long, guys!

    "text": "\nMonday \u2014\n\nKara, perhaps out of a want for thoroughness in her story, perhaps out of a Millennial-born urge to creep on a the social media of a woman she finds intriguing, discovers that Lena Luthor has a pretty active following on Instagram one afternoon not long after their first meeting. It\u2019s there she discovers a playful side to Lena, kissing girls on cheeks at parties, looking blitzed out of her mind with a bunch of well-dressed men in the back of someone\u2019s car; debauched with heavy-lidded eyes and a knowing smirk in blood red lipstick in the arms of some gorgeous starlet.\u00a0 There are pictures of her in front of landmarks from all over the world. She looks like a rich man\u2019s daughter in these pictures, playful, bashful, and grinning at the camera. Mixed into the fray of boarding school friends and clear wealth there are some\u00a0absolutely adorable\u00a0baby pictures for #throwbackthursday. Those make Kara wish there were pictures of her as a child on this planet. Kal\u2019s scoured his records, but there are no pictures of the extended family at the Fortress of Solitude.\u00a0\nShe debates it, just for a moment, before following Lena. \u00a0\nTwenty minutes later, as Kara\u2019s flipping through her notebook looking for something the mayor\u2019s secretary told her about the new green publishing initiative in the city, a notification appears on her phone.\n\nlenaaaluthor has followed you back!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nKara gains 200 followers in a day. There are people from all over the world picking through her feed, commenting on pictures of her with Alex, her with Eliza, her with Kal and Lois at that writer\u2019s conference last Christmas. It\u2019s then she realizes that Lena only follows ten people on Instagram. Kara was the eleventh.\u00a0\nSo maybe Kara cleans up her feed a little bit, out of paranoia.\u00a0She takes down the few photographs of herself with Cat Grant that had made it onto her feed, gets a text from Cat demanding to know why (because of course she pays attention to such things), and has to explain that there are strange people from all over the world commenting on her stuff because Lena Luthor added her as a friend on Instagram.\n\nCat \u2013 And are you friends?\n\n\nKara \u2013 I\u2019m not sure.\n\n\nCat is typing\u2026\n\n\nCat is typing\u2026\n\n\nCat \u2013 I worry about you being friends with someone with a name like that. \n\nThe layers of implication are there, the hinting at the fact that Cat knows but will never come directly out and say so, it makes Kara happy and sad, fearful and worried. Cat knowing was never part of her plan, but she hasn\u2019t been exactly subtle.\n\nKara \u2013 It\u2019s just Insta, Cat. No need to be worried.\n\nKara deletes a few more pictures, leaving her with a feed of mostly family pictures and the benign documentation of her quest to find the best potstickers in the city back in college \u2013 a saga that Alex still gives Kara shit for to this day.\n\n\nFriday \u2014\n\n\nThey don\u2019t every talk about the fact that they\u2019re friends on Instagram now. Kara spends a few hours digging through Friday morning CatCo corporate policy to make sure that she\u2019s totally correct in her assumption that she\u2019s not committing some sort of cardinal sin for being friends with Lena on social media. There\u2019s nothing indicating that her social media, no matter if it\u2019s personal, is under the purview of CatCo \u2013 so she thinks she\u2019s okay.\u00a0 She keeps her friendship with Lena away from Twitter or Facebook, and doesn\u2019t really talk about it to anyone.\nKara\u2019s sent to speak to Lena on some anti-alien rally in the city, get a quote about L-Corp\u2019s new policy toward alien employees and possibly something scathing about her bother in the same breath. She sits and waits dutifully until Lena\u2019s free, fidgeting and reading her Twitter feed \u2013 the rally\u2019s got people really worked up. Kara tweets about how she hates that people feel the need to protest the presence of aliens in the city when so many of them are refugees, and sits back. She hates this, hates that she\u2019s send to speak to Lena about this, when L-Corp is doing so much good in for the alien community. Lena is trying to rise above the atrocities committed by a man she loved with all her might, by a family who gave her a name and power when she had none. Kara wants to write about that.\n\u201cMs. Danvers?\u201d Jess, Lena\u2019s spitfire of a secretary, calls from her desk. \u201cYou can go up. Thank you for being understanding\u2026under the circumstances. I know you\u2019ve got carte blanche to run up whenever you want.\u201d\nDucking her head to hide her burning cheeks, Kara gathers her things. When her ears stop burning and she\u2019s able to look Jess in the eye, she nods. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I know she\u2019s a busy woman.\u201d\n\u201cA busy woman who\u2019s allowed you a great deal of access,\u201d Jess answers. She tilts her head to one side and glances Kara\u2019s wrinkled work shirt and blazer with a distasteful curl of her lip. \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t lose her trust, Ms. Danvers, she\u2019d make a powerful enemy for CatCo\u2026and you.\u201d\nKara bristles at the threat, but forces herself to smile sweetly. \u201cIt\u2019s the duty of the press to report the truth. If Ms. Luthor \u2013 or anyone else for that matter \u2013 takes issue with my work, they can speak to my editor or the CatCo legal team.\u201d\u00a0 She jabs the button on the elevator. It takes a moment to respond and Kara wishes Jess would stop glaring at her like she was some sort of threat.\u00a0 Kara fiddles with her glasses.\u00a0 \u201cBesides, Jess, that\u2019s a conversation for me to have with Ms. Luthor, not with you.\u201d The elevator arrives then, and Kara\u2019s smirk is just a little wicked as Jess glowers at her as the doors close.\n\u00a0\nLena is, interestingly enough, paging through Twitter when Kara gets up to her office.\u00a0 She\u2019s got a live feed of the #ETGOHOME hashtag projected onto the wall beside her desk and is standing in the middle of her office, arms cross and a scowl on her face.\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re here for a quote.\u201d Lena doesn\u2019t turn around.\n\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t to ask you to tell your Instagram followers to stop stalking me.\u201d The joke falls a little flat, Kara\u2019s cheeks burn again. She always feels a little awkward, a little uncomfortable around Lena. It\u2019s like how she felt with James, and the girl she liked in college \u2013 or all those boys in high school. It isn\u2019t the uncomfortable that comes with the Luthor name or the fact that Kara is keeping secrets from her. It\u2019s the uncomfortable that comes with curiosity and attraction, and that, honestly, is what scares Kara most of all because she\u2019s not supposed to feel this way.\nHer brain isn\u2019t wired this way.\n\u201cAre they?\u201d Lena asks, a little pensive, distracted. She scowls and snaps her fingers, the projector feed goes dark. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. I should have\u2014\u201d She looks at Kara then, and her face instantly brightens, instantly goes from annoyed to welcoming. \u201cI should have warned you, they can be\u2014intense.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m verified,\u201d Kara answers. Winn did it for her a when she started at CatCo, because Cat Grant also has a lot of social media followers and being able to sort through the crazy was once part of Kara\u2019s job. \u201cSo it\u2019s not that big a deal. Just weird. I\u2019m not used to that kind of following.\u201d\n\u201cIs this your, lord, save me from your followers pitch?\u201d Lena grins. \u201cIt isn\u2019t very good.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll endeavor to do better, then.\u201d Kara shoots back. She steps a little closer, hands in her pockets. \u201cWas that the protest feed you just closed?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Lena rubs at the back of her neck. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting what they\u2019re doing down there.\u201d She glances sideways at Kara. \u201cThat\u2019s not nearly scathing enough for Snapper Carr is it?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not.\u201d Kara laughs and moves to the window.\u00a0 Below, the protest stretches for blocks in each direction. She wonders if Supergirl should make an appearance, if she could find the words to soften the hatred in the hearts of these people. She doesn\u2019t think she can, and she hates it.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to do better.\u201d Lena comes to stand beside Kara. She presses her palm to the window, her lips pitched downward. \u201cI heard there was a counter-protest.\u201d\n\u201cThere is.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think it will turn violent\u2026if they were to meet?\u201d\nKara shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. People don\u2019t talk to each other anymore. Snapper says that\u2019s what sells papers, but I think maybe people should talk to each other, try to understand where the other\u2019s coming from.\u201d\u00a0\nLena says nothing, but her hand moves from the window to brush against Kara\u2019s, and when Kara glances over at her, her ears are bright red and there\u2019s a flush on the back of her neck as well. \u201cWhat if L-Corp were to sponsor a round table \u2013 a way to bring both sides together? Would CatCo agree to moderate it?\u201d\n\u201cWho? James?\u201d\n\u201cHe is your ex,\u201d Lena glances sideways at Kara. \u201cI figure you still have some clout with him. You posted a picture with him just last week.\u201d\n\u201cOh. That.\u201d\u00a0 Winn had come for a visit with James mostly, but Kara had stumbled in on them and the three of them had gone out to lunch with Lucy and Alex. Lucy was in from wherever the DEO had sent her overseas, and James had no idea she was in town. Kara loves the picture Alex\u2019s friend Maggie took of all of them. Her arm is slung over James, Lucy on his other side. He\u2019s kissing Lucy\u2019s head and holding Kara\u2019s hand. Alex was giving Lucy bunny ears, and Winn was leaning against Kara so far he was almost sideways. She\u2019d posted it early Sunday morning, sitting cross legged high above the city, alone in her thoughts and the blood red sunrise that reminded her too much of home. They were her home now, her family.\nLena liked the picture, but she hadn\u2019t commented. Kara\u2019s a little surprised she\u2019s brought it up. \u201cYes that.\u201d\n\u201cDoes this mean if I ask you for an exclusive quote from Mindy Sorrenson you could hook me up?\u201d It\u2019s a bit of a dig; Mindy\u2019s been in a few of Lena\u2019s Instagram photos, always looking well-sexed and far too cozy to be anything other than romantically involved with Lena. And Kara isn\u2019t jealous. No.\nLena coughs, and the flush at the back of her neck goes a little redder. \u201cRight, we\u2019ll leave exes out of it then.\u201d\nKara laughs, but inwardly, she\u2019s panicking, because that\u2019s confirmation of something she hadn\u2019t thought of, something that makes this feel a little more real. \u201cI don\u2019t mind asking James, but if you go down this route, you are going to attract a lot of bad press. You can\u2019t be seen to choose a side.\u201d\n\u201cActually\u2026\u201d Lena taps her chin. \u201cI know you have connections with Supergirl. Do you think you could get her to come visit me?\u201d\nFrowning, Kara tries to follow Lena\u2019s train of thought. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I do want to pick a side?\u201d Lena grins. \u201cBest do it with National City\u2019s own alien hero, right?\u201d\nInwardly, Kara groans.\n\n\nMonday \u2014\n\n\nKara ends up writing a puff piece for the website about herself. Snapper is less than amused by Lena Luthor not playing the villain he\u2019d been trying to set up in the narrative. Kara gets the sense he doesn\u2019t give much of a damn what aliens do in the city, but the picture Lena posted on her Instagram makes it hard to ignore that the powers that be are choosing sides.\nIt\u2019s a picture from the center of the #alienswelcome counter protest to the #ETGOHOME protest. Lena\u2019s got an American flag bandanna around her wrist and t-shirt printed with the L-Corp outreach program\u2019s logo: always welcome National City. Kara, well, Supergirl\u2019s got her arm slung around Lena\u2019s waist. She\u2019s holding a sign that someone handed her that reads: Alien, National City resident, taxpayer. Someone in the crowd took it for Supergirl, using Supergirl\u2019s phone. It isn\u2019t exactly posed, but it certainly isn\u2019t a candid shot either.\u00a0 Kara stares at it for a long time before sending it to Lena from an encrypted JLA email account late Sunday night, with permission to use it if she wanted. She isn\u2019t sure what, exactly, Lena\u2019s angle is, and the fear of seeing herself \u2013 only not herself \u2013 on Lena\u2019s Instagram feed with all those intense people scrutinizing her is\u2026 well, it\u2019s a bit much.\nLena posts it the next morning with a carefully written caption that Snapper\u2019s pretty damn convinced was written by her press office.\n\n#alwayswelcome is an initiative started by L-Corp close to a decade ago to be inclusive of LGBT individuals working within our organization. L-Corp believes that everyone who comes through our doors is worthy of dignity and respect, and we believe that this protection should extend to those from beyond the confines of our planet. #alienswelcome\n\n\u201cLena goddamn Luthor isn\u2019t following the script,\u201d Snapper grumbles when he sees the picture. \u201cShe\u2019s supposed to be an anti-alien bigot, not some black sheep.\u201d\n\u201cI think she just wants people to get along,\u201d Kara says. Snapper scowls at her, but Kara\u2019s mind is a million miles away. She\u2019s thinking about L-Corp\u2019s alien detection device and how Lena looked at it and saw dollar signs. She\u2019s pragmatic, and her bias is far more subtle. She wonders if Lena even realizes it, if that\u2019s the lesson she\u2019s going to have to find a way to help Lena to see.\n\u201cI want 500 words on the protest, with quotes from Luthor and Supergirl for the website by three so we can hit the afternoon lull and the evening commute.\u201d Snapper rubs his chin for a moment before rounding on Kara. \u201cAnd Danvers?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir?\u201d\n\u201cNo bias this time.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not, sir.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cQuoting yourself in articles now, sis?\u201d Alex says over their private com channel. Kara\u2019s flying, well, more accurately she\u2019s dodging some sort of bright orange beam weapon that packed a punch like the force of a semi and could fire rapidly. There was, naturally, violence at the #ETGOHOME protest. The DEO followed the signal to somewhere in the vicinity of the warehouse district and Kara\u2019s tracked down the source.\n\u201cWhat the hell was I supposed to do?\u201d Kara demands, rolling to the side and landing a good kick. The guy she\u2019s fighting hisses in pain. Kara cracks an elbow over his head for good measure. \u201cTell him I couldn\u2019t get a quote? Or that Supergirl didn\u2019t want her to post the damn picture?\u201d Which was not technically true, but made Kara feel better about Alex\u2019s ire.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not stupid, he\u2019s going to figure it out.\u201d Alex shouts something unintelligible and Kara has to throw herself to the ground to get out of the rain of bullets the DEO sends in a volley over her head. The guy with the orange beam gun falls to the ground and Kara\u2019s pushing off the ground to grab his weapon and roll to train it on him. He shouts a curse at her, a lewd term in a language she hasn\u2019t heard in over a decade. Kara\u2019s knuckles go white, her finger itches on the trigger of the gun. Her expression is closed, dark.\u00a0 She wants to pull the trigger and kill this man, and the urge is so strong it takes all she has to break the gun over her knee and throw it to the ground.\n\u201cWhy the hell did you do that?\u201d Alex demands, scurrying forward to collect the pieces and scowling at their ruin. \u201cWe needed that tech.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need it,\u201d Kara shakes her head. \u201cYou want it, to study it \u2013\u201d\n\u201cTo better protect this city from it!\u201d Alex protests.\nKara bites her lip and looks away; she changes the subject because this fight isn\u2019t worth it. \u201cI worry about where it\u2019s coming from. If we have a leak, doesn\u2019t that mean that the DEO shouldn\u2019t house alien tech?\u201d She can\u2019t tell Alex she wanted to kill the man for what he called her.\n\u201cThis one is from CADMUS, it has to be,\u201d Alex retorts.\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who are instigating these protests and riots. The DEO is just trying to keep the peace.\u201d\nSwallowing, Kara bends down and flips the gun over.\u00a0 There, on the side, is a logo, but it isn\u2019t CADMUS, it\u2019s something else entirely. Something Kara recognizes, but she can\u2019t remember where she\u2019s seen it. Her fingers itch. She wants to fly to the moon to get away from all of this \u2013 this budding war she\u2019s trapped in the middle of between humans and people like her, people who are just trying to get by in an increasingly hostile world.\u00a0 \u201cHave you ever seen this before?\u201d she shows Alex. Alex shakes her head, but moves to start getting it into an evidence bag.\u00a0 She\u2019s exhausted, and it\u2019s getting late. The DEO won't have much until the morning anyway. \u201cI need to get going.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Alex says, and lets Kara go.\n\u00a0\nKara stands in the shower, thinking about that word, and that feeling, the feeling that she hasn\u2019t felt since leaving Krypton. It\u2019s an old insult, a childish one at that \u2013 but even the dull knife of long-repressed memory cuts sometimes. She knows what it means, it means that the #ETGOHOME protest has some alien origins to it as well, because who else would know those words, know how to say them in the correct inflection and with the right click to the tongue.\u00a0 She turns her face to the stream of water and lets it drown out whatever she\u2019s feeling, because that rage, that pain at the loss of billions of souls, it has no place here anymore. Those old conflicts, those old wars are long gone. Non, Astra, they were the last of her people. They\u2019re dead. Now it\u2019s just Kara, just Kal; just the two of them and the baggage of the entire universe\u2014or at least anyone who remembers how to hurt Kryptonians with words alone.\nShe gets out of the shower before she starts to prune, mostly because the hot water is starting to run out. Kara puts on sweats and curls up on her bed, flicking through her phone, before she remembers, with just the barest hint of a groan, that Lena Luthor\u2019s posted a picture of Supergirl on her Instagram feed.\nThe comments on Lena\u2019s picture with Supergirl are insane. There is infighting, insults, and a lot of speculation about how intimately Lena Luthor knows Supergirl. Apparently Lena is a bit of a player, at least according to the comments on the post, and if she\u2019s got her sights set on Supergirl, all bets are off. \u00a0Kara has to stop reading them after a while, but it is heartening to watch Lena\u2019s follower count on Instagram go down as all the anti-alien bigots unfollow her. \u00a0There\u2019s one comment that gives her pause, another comment, like the one shouted at her in anger today, but she pushes the thought aside. There\u2019s no way to replicate Kryptonese on the iPhone anyway.\nShe\u2019s about to close the app when she notices she has a direct message.\u00a0 It\u2019s from Lena. She opens it to find a note.\n\n\nlenaaaluthor: \n\nNow that we\u2019ve had the conversation about exes, and have ascertained that we are both attractive, single young professionals, would you be amenable to a drink? \n\nKara bites her lip and curls onto her side, thumbs flying. She decides that if this is going to happen she needs to speak frankly to Lena about how her company is talking out of both sides of its mouth regarding alien rights. Maybe this drink, because she can\u2019t get drunk (a tragedy Alex laments constantly \u2013 though this friend of hers with the alien bar hookup might actually change that), is a place to do that.\n\n\nKaraD4nvers: \n\nIs this your way of asking me out? \n\n\n\nlenaaaluthor: \n\nIt could be.\n\n\n\nlenaaaluthor: \n\nIf you\u2019re interested.\n\n\n\nKaraD4nvers: \n\nI would be \u2013 I mean, yes, I am interested. Where?\n\n\n\nlenaaaluthor:\n\n\u00a0 Let me surprise you. Meet me on 7th and Trade at eight tomorrow. I have a meeting that ends at 7 - it shouldn\u2019t run over. I\u2019ll have Jess call if it does.\n\n\n\nKaraD4nvers\n\n: I don\u2019t think Jess likes me.\n\n\n\nlenaaaluthor: \n\nJess doesn\u2019t like anyone, but I don\u2019t pay her to question me. She does what she\u2019s told. She\u2019ll call you if I\u2019m running late.\n\n\n\nKaraD4nvers: \n\nOk. Should I um\u2026dress up?\n\n\n\nlenaaaluthor: \n\nYou\u2019ll be with me Kara, it wouldn\u2019t matter if you had just rolled around in a mud pit.\n\n\n\nlenaaaluthor: \n\nBut please shower if you have to roll in a mud pit.\n\n\n\nKaraD4nvers\n\n: For sure. I\u2019ll see you.\n\n\n\nlenaaaluthor: \n\nLooking forward to it.\n\nKara, on a whim, likes Lena\u2019s Supergirl picture before closing out the app and flopping back, staring up at the ceiling she\u2019s decorated in stars that reflect the night sky she remembers from her bedroom window on Krypton. They\u2019re glowing faintly now, high above her bed. Kara wonders if this is some sort of side effect of growing up on Earth \u2013 that she\u2019s so open to this when passion and attraction when such things did not exist on Krypton. That part of her brain, the brain that was going to go into the Science Academy, understands that Lena is a good match, as James was. They\u2019re both in a position of power, with a name that would bring glory to the House of El though the union.\nBut it\u2019s just a date and Kara\u2019s shoving her fist into her mouth and biting down to feel something that will suppress her groan.\u00a0 Her dueling socializations always escalate things too quickly; always make her feel panicked about the idea of romance. It\u2019s why she\u2019s so oblivious until she finds herself wanting.\nKal once compared Kryptonians to pandas, in the middle of an argument with Kara over a disagreement over his wanting to marry Lois. Kara, at sixteen, didn\u2019t think it was a good idea or a fair match. She was trying to be his parent when he wanted nothing to do with him, when he was an adult, a human adult that Kara could scarcely understand. \u00a0\u201cI love her Kara,\u201d he said.\n\u201cLove isn\u2019t something we feel.\u201d\nNow, staring up at the ceiling of her bedroom, Kara feels even more of an ass than she felt then. It\u2019s only nine thirty in Metropolis, she calls Kal.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you ever wonder about what it would be like growing up on Krypton?\u201d\nHe pauses, there\u2019s the sound of dishes clinking, and then a sliding door opening and then closing. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Kara?\u201d\n\u201cI was thinking about what I said to you, when you told me you wanted to marry Lois. How I thought it would be a bad match.\u201d\n\u201cYes, because journalists make no money and have to fight and claw for any prestige they have, I remember.\u201d He isn\u2019t being short with her, but rather his tone is gentle, teasing.\nKara\u2019s always had a strange relationship with him, older and younger at the same time, this is when she finds the words choking in her throat. When she wants to tell him what it means to have the memories of two entirely different societies crammed into her brain. So she changes the subject, just a little. \u201cI got asked out.\u201d\n\u201cWith someone who wouldn\u2019t be a good match.\u201d\n\u201cNo, she would.\u201d\n\u201cBut she\u2019s a she.\u201d Kal understands that part better than most. Kara\u2019s always struggled with it, just a little bit. Because she is attracted to girls, and to boys too. Trying to supersede a childhood of socialization that attraction is good matches in terms of the Matrix and not about love or want or desire has been hard for Kara in a way she\u2019d never thought possible.\u00a0\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\nKal sighs. Kara can almost picture him pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cJimmy\u2019s a guy, but you broke it off with him.\u201d\n\u201cJames is a wonderful guy, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I...I didn\u2019t see it until people pointed it out to me over and over and over again.\u201d Kara feels like she\u2019s whining. Whining about how she\u2019s oblivious and maybe broken when it comes to this sort of thing. \u201cI wanted him, I was attracted to him, yes, but I wouldn\u2019t ever act on it, not without everyone I know telling me to go for it \u2013 that\u2019s not how my brain works, Kal. I wasn\u2019t socialized that way\u2026or at least, I wasn\u2019t, and then I was and now I\u2019m confused\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd this girl\u2026you feel that way again?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Kara sighs. \u201cI feel something. I think it\u2019s more than just admiration or attraction. It feels like\u2026Like she smiles at me and my whole body catches on fire, I feel her touch long after she takes her hand away, and when she looks at me in certain ways, stars, Kal, my brain short circuits and I want her to consume me. It\u2019s never been like this before. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\nKal chuckles. \u201cYou want to have sex with her. That\u2019s a pretty normal human experience, Kara.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 what?\u201d Kara shakes her head. \u201cNo! I\u2019ve had sex, lots of sex, it isn\u2019t like that!\u201d It\u2019s only after the words out of Kara\u2019s mouth that she finds herself wanting to jam them back inside, cram them away where Kal can never know how Kara likes to please and will say yes to the strange traditions of her new home.\u00a0\n\u201cI really am not the person to be having this conversation with you, let me get Lois.\u201d The sliding door opens, and Kal calls out to Lois. Kara, privately wants to die.\nLois, however, is helpful in her cutting way that makes Kara long for Cat Grant. She talks Kara through the situation asking the same sorts of questions Kara grew used to Cat asking during her two year employment under her. She tells Kara that just because you say yes to someone and consent to the act you engage in doesn\u2019t mean that you want it \u2013 like want it, want it. And it sounds like Kara\u2019s experiencing lust for the first time ever, or maybe something\u2019s just clicking where it never clicked before.\u00a0\nKara, secretly, is probably dead of embarrassment. She mumbles her way through the conversation and tries not to die of humiliation when Lois asks who the lucky lady is. She doesn\u2019t answer Lois because that conversation isn\u2019t one she wants to have on top of the one she\u2019s currently having. She instead steers the conversation to Snapper and how to deal with his insane expectations regarding her \u2018Supergirl source.\u2019\nThe next morning, and it\u2019s just barely that when Kara gets a call in to work to cover a massive pile up on the I-5, she has a notification on Instagram: Lois_Lane has tagged you in a photo.\nIt\u2019s a picture of them from the writer\u2019s conference last Christmas, heads bowed together and deep in discussion over, if Kara remembers correctly, Cat Grant\u2019s latest book with a caption reading: Had a great talk with one of my favorite people last night.\u00a0 Good luck, kiddo, remember to breathe. \nIt\u2019s four-thirty in the morning, but somehow, Lena\u2019s already liked the picture.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKara spends the day avoiding her phone and the wild speculation going on in the comments of Lois\u2019s Instagram picture about the relationship between that kid reporter working for CatCo and Lois Lane; especially given the relationship between Cat Grant and Lois Lane. Lena\u2019s crazy followers, have, evidently found the photo and are now trying to figure out who Kara really is. There\u2019s a few links to stories with her byline on the CatCo website, but Kara\u2019s forcing herself to ignore them. Or rather, she\u2019s trying, but she keeps getting notifications.\n\n\nSojah.s13 \n\nSo she follows this reporter, who also knows Lois Lane, and then is posting pictures with Supergirl? Coincidence?\n\n\n\nAtttcoconut @\n\nSojah.s13 check her articles linked upthread. There\u2019s a few quotes from Supergirl. Maybe LL is just using her for the connection.\n\n\n\nSojah.s13 \n\n@atttcoconut No one knows who Supergirl really is. Maybe she\u2019s this reporter.\n\n\n\nAtttcoconut \n\n@Sojah.S13 Get real, this kid was Cat Grant\u2019s secretary. She knows Supergirl through Cat Grant. \n\nKara groans and goes into her settings to turn off her notifications. She\u2019s got stuff to do for Snapper anyway after she finishes the accident story for the website. She\u2019s been thrown in to background research into some corruption case involving the dockworker\u2019s union and city hall, trying to find connections in a long string of seemingly unrelated emails. Kara\u2019s starting to discover that she likes this part of the job, where she can dig through pages upon pages of technical information and find patterns and connections.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very meditative activity, and it gives Kara a chance to quiet her mind.\nBy the time seven o\u2019clock rolls around, Kara\u2019s found two potential leads and has run them by Snapper. He wants her to follow up, but as it\u2019s after business hours it\u2019ll have to be in the morning.\u00a0 If Snapper\u2019s annoyed about that, he doesn\u2019t so much ire in his grunt of approval at her proposal.\n\u201cYou talk to Lois Lane yesterday?\u201d He asks as Kara\u2019s making to leave.\n\u201cI did.\u201d Kara says, because she really can\u2019t deny it.\n\u201cHow do you know her \u2013 thought Cat?\u201d\nKara laughs, polite. \u201cNo sir, she\u2019s married to my cousin.\u201d\n\u201cWho? Wait\u2014Kent? He\u2019s your cousin?\u201d\u00a0 Snapper shakes his head. \u201cHuh, small world. Always thought she settled.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t let her hear that, sir.\u201d Kara doesn\u2019t rise to the bait about Kal. She can\u2019t. Cat did the same thing with Lois and Kara always bit her tongue. It wasn\u2019t worth it. \u201cNothing gets her going faster.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t doubt it. You\u2019re just full of secrets, aren\u2019t you, Danvers?\u201d\nKara shrugs and leaves before he can ask her anything else awkward.\n\u00a0\nShe stands on the northwest corner of 7th and Trade at three to eight in a slightly nicer red dress than she\u2019d usually wear to work and a sharp black blazer to go with it. Her heels are black, tall, borrowed from Alex (who has kept them for some reason \u2013 they\u2019re her getting laid shoes apparently \u2013 Kara finds this detail horrifying). Maybe she\u2019s channeling Cat, just a little bit; the woman is a fashion icon, after all. Maybe she just wants to look good for Lena, because if what Lois said to her last night is true, that\u2019s what Kara wants more than anything.\nKara is terrified. Terrified of what it means to act on something like this. This isn\u2019t how she was raised as a child. This isn\u2019t \u2013 well, this isn\u2019t something she\u2019s accustomed to wanting.\u00a0 She thought, maybe, with James, but it never came beyond that intense moment when she did want him and she feels so goddamn awful about it. The sex was okay, but Kara didn\u2019t feel anything at all and it made her feel even worse. The conversation where she explained the Matrix to James was one of the most awful conversations she\u2019s ever had to have. He looked at her with such sympathy and such horror that Kara wanted to claw away the ground she stood upon and fling herself into the earth\u2019s core below.\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 Christ, Kara, how do you unlearn that?\u201d\nCrying, for what felt like the first time in forever, Kara shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nHe held her afterwards; let her tell him how she saw him, in the eyes of the Matrix. How he was perfect but her mind wouldn\u2019t move past generations of socialization to allow her to experience the desire she knew she should feel for him at this stage in their relationship.\u00a0 \u201cAnd with Lucy\u2026\u201d\nJames had gone quiet then, his expression pained. He still loved Lucy, Kara knew that now \u2013 he\u2019d said her name, when they were...well, Kara\u2019s pretty sure that\u2019s the biggest slap in the face you can give a girl without actually hitting her. His love of Lucy was what made this easier, or maybe harder at the same time. Kara cried into his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said when she ended it.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d\nA hand closes on her shoulder and Kara blinks, wills herself not to react, for shrugging her shoulder to get away could lead to whomever is grabbing her being flung into oncoming traffic.\u00a0 Kara turns, and it\u2019s only Lena, dressed for the office still in killer heels and this silky black blouse that makes Kara\u2019s mouth go dry. Her lipstick is pale today, beautiful, and her hair\u2019s tugged up in some sort of messy updo that looks deliberately messy and low-effort but is actually quite intricate. The pins in her hair catch the light. She looks shiny.\n\u201cYou were a million miles away.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Kara says.\nLena\u2019s fingers brush against Kara\u2019s cheek.\u00a0 \u201cYou were crying. Kara, if you\u2019re not up to this\u2026\u201d\nKara swipes angrily at her eyes. \u201cNo,\u201d her tone is forceful. \u201cThis is what I want.\u201d And when she says it like that, in her Supergirl voice and with all the confidence behind it she can muster, she almost believes it.\n\u201cAlright then, tough guy, let\u2019s go put some alcohol in you and maybe you can tell me why you were crying.\u201d Lena offers Kara her arm, and Kara takes it, still a little sniffily, still a little sad.\n\u00a0\nThey go to some club Kara\u2019s never heard of. Lena hasn\u2019t been in National City long, but she moves though the spaces of privilege like she\u2019s a native. They bypass the line and go around the back of the club to the VIP section. There are no cameras here, the entrance is well masked.\u00a0 Lena punches in a number into the key pad and the door slides open to reveal a small space cast in red light.\nLena pays the cover without a word and drags Kara up a narrow flight of stairs into a room full of low couches and tables with little mushroom-like lamps arranged artfully amid rose petals.\n\u201cThose are new,\u201d Lena comments, looking at the rose petals. She leads Kara through the room, her hand hot in Kara\u2019s palm, and sitting down in a loveseat tucked into an alcove farthest from the door. \u201cRomantic.\u201d\n\u201cLena there\u2019s no one here,\u201d Kara says, because it\u2019s weird. It\u2019s late enough that there should be people here.\nShe laughs and pulls Kara to sit down beside her. \u201cThe club doesn\u2019t officially open until next month. This is the soft opening. I\u2019m an investor.\u201d\u00a0 Lena eyes the door. \u201cThere should be people filtering in, but if you\u2019d prefer, we could go downstairs and mingle with the common folk.\u201d\nKara swallows. Lena\u2019s thigh is pressed against her own, and the fabric of Lena\u2019s slacks is silky soft and Kara wants to touch it with her fingertips, but she\u2019s too afraid to move.\u00a0\nThe door to the stairs opens, and a couple, and then a second couple filter in.\u00a0 Kara exhales, shakily, and shakes her head. \u201cNo, this is fine.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Kara\u2019s tone has bite to it. The bite she felt yesterday when fighting that guy. Lena\u2019s eyebrow quirks, but she doesn\u2019t say anything at all, instead reaching for the cocktail menu from where it\u2019s perched amid the rose petals.\n\u201cWhat do you want to drink?\u201d\u00a0\nKara reads the menu quickly, and wonders if it\u2019s Cat\u2019s influence that\u2019s coloring her when she selects the driest martini she can find. She, unlike Cat, orders it with orange peel \u2013 olives are disgusting. Lena goes for something that appears to be about 98% bourbon and 2% some fruity mixer Kara\u2019s never heard of. The waitress is discrete, in and out in under three minutes.\u00a0\n\u201cAs an investor, is it a conflict of interest to plug your own club?\u201d Lena wonders, arranging her drink so it catches the light and the rose petals and snapping a picture with her phone.\nKara looks up, she\u2019s worrying a nail, and Lena\u2019s captured the moment on film: alien girl; just come from work, chewing on her nail in low light, martini cradled in her free hand, forlorn. Lena\u2019s got a knack for photography, Kara will give her that.\u00a0 She\u2019s captured how nervous Kara feels, and how apprehensive she looks.\n\u201cCan I post this?\u201d Lena asks, staring down at the photograph. Her fingers pinch and zoom, contemplating a crop before deciding against it. \u201cThis\u2026 Kara you look beautiful\u2026 a little lost, but beautiful.\u201d\nSwallowing, Kara thinks about it for a moment before nodding. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d She\u2019ll deal with the fall out in the morning. \u00a0She tips her martini back and takes a larger sip than perhaps a human would, and swallows without coughing.\nLena, for her part, looks impressed. \u201cWanna be tagged?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d Maybe she\u2019s being agreeable, maybe it the vermouth talking now. Kara can\u2019t get drunk, but if she drinks quickly enough, she\u2019ll attract a temporary \u2013 and by temporary she means like less than two minutes in duration \u2013 buzz that settles out the jitters. Enough for her to start to talk to Lena about things they both care about.\u00a0 She\u2019s spoken to James about the round table discussion on alien rights that L-Corp wants to sponsor, and he\u2019s amenable to the idea, with a few stipulations, which she lays out to Lena in quick succession.\u00a0 Lena listens, asks questions, and allows Kara to steer the conversation, for which Kara\u2019s grateful.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo what happened with you and James?\u201d\nThey\u2019re three drinks in now, and Kara\u2019s definitely not drunk but is relaxed enough to allow Lena lean against her. Lena can also hold her alcohol, but she\u2019s looking a little unfocused now, her fingers playing with a curl of Kara\u2019s hair.\u00a0 Every time her fingers get too close to Kara\u2019s neck, there\u2019s this moment when Kara\u2019s breath hitches. Kal was right. This is want, desire, everything she didn\u2019t think herself capable of feeling. It\u2019s terrifying.\n\u201cWhat happened with you and Mindy?\u201d Kara asks.\n\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d Lena nudges Kara with her knee. \u201cYou go first.\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much to tell,\u201d Kara says. \u201cHe was still hung up on his ex and I\u2026 It didn\u2019t work, like, I thought it could, he\u2019s a good match\u2026we like each other, like a lot. The sex was okay\u2026 But I\u2019m just not\u2026 my brain\u2026\u201d She waves her hand and looks down at her knees, wondering if this is the moment when she tells Lena she\u2019s an alien and broken because she can\u2019t really feel desire the way humans do.\nAnd somehow Lena knows, in that moment, Kara doesn\u2019t even need to tell her and somehow it\u2019s the freshest breath of air that Kara\u2019s ever tasted.\u00a0 \u201cDo you usually feel that way?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in relationships?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Kara says, her cheeks burning. She isn\u2019t ashamed, it\u2019s her culture, and she has to keep it alive. There are people like that on Earth too, she\u2019s seen them at parades \u2013 but it isn\u2019t the same, not really.\nLena\u2019s fingers close around Kara\u2019s hand, a tactical action that can in no way be read as anything other than gentle friendship. \u201cDo you feel that way now?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a lump in Kara\u2019s throat that feels the size of her fist. She pushes back against it, swallowing hard and meeting Lena\u2019s gaze for the first time. Her eyes are soft in the low light, warm, understanding. They tell Kara that if she says yes, Lena won\u2019t hold it against her. But Kara doesn\u2019t know if she feels that way now. She doesn\u2019t know at all. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Kara swallows again. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nSo Lena moves even closer and her breath smells like bourbon and sweet juice and Kara is the one who closes the distance between them. It\u2019s a brief, gentle kiss, and Lena pulls away before Kara can decide what she wants to do next.\u00a0 Her fingers brush against Kara\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re crying again.\u201d\nKara\u2019s fingers are trembling when she raises them to touch her cheek. They come away wet and streaked with black. Her mascara\u2019s run. She exhales shakily. \u201cI guess I am.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause that\u2026\u201d Kara stops, because she realizes what she wants to do more than anything else is kiss Lena again. So she does, this time with her fingers cradling Lena\u2019s cheeks, and Lena nipping at her lower lip. This sort of kiss \u2013 she\u2019s choking on the emotion of it \u2013 because the emotion is telling her this is right like a switch being flipped.\u00a0 Lena\u2019s warm and soft and when she moves to settle in Kara\u2019s lap, Kara doesn\u2019t fight it. Because this is what you do in the VIP section of a private club, and this is what you do when something actually fits for the first time in your life.\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019re waiting on their shared uber when Kara remembers: \u201cYou never told me about Mindy.\u201d\nLena shivers in the cool evening air off the hills and scoots closer.\u00a0 Kara throws an arm around her shoulder. Lena relaxes, then, as though the protective circle of Kara\u2019s arm actually can do anything to keep her warm. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t out.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\n\u201cWhich wasn\u2019t really a problem, until I wanted to go with her when she was up for a Golden Globe last year and she wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d Lena shakes her head. \u201cI really didn\u2019t want it to end\u2026but everything with Lex was blowing up then too, and I couldn\u2019t handle her fear on top of everything else going wrong in my life.\u201d Lena goes quiet for a moment, relaxing against Kara. \u201cDoes that make me a bad person?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Kara says. \u201cThat just makes you capable of taking care of yourself.\u201d\nLena bites her lip and looks down at her feet. \u201cI feel awful about it, though. I could have actually loved her.\u201d\n\u201cI did \u2013 do \u2013 love James.\u201d Kara exhales. It feels so good to say it. \u201cHe was a good match.\u201d\n\u201cYou keep saying that\u2026 this isn\u2019t the 1600s where they\u2019ll sell you off for the highest dowry.\u201d Lena giggles. \u201cThough, I think I could match anything James Olsen has to offer.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have your people call my people,\u201d Kara counters, before going quiet for a moment. She\u2019s searching for the words to tell Lena what a good match is. Lena doesn\u2019t have to know everything, but she could know this. This probably won\u2019t change how she feels. \u201cWhere I grew up, we were raised to view relationships very differently than they\u2019re viewed here.\u201d She looks at Lena, watching her for a reaction, but Lena got this unreadable, probably thoughtful, maybe apprehensive, look on her face.\u00a0 Like she\u2019s waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u00a0 \u201cMarriage was about status and advancement. Love was never a part of it. Only if the match was truly deemed good would the possibly of children be discussed. We don\u2019t\u2026 experience attraction, love, desire, like most.\u201d\n\u201cAre you saying what I think you\u2019re saying?\u201d Lena asks.\nKara shrugs. \u201cI could be.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Lena says. She swallows, a little panic creeping into her voice. \u201cI\u2019m not like Lex.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Kara says. \u201cI would never\u2026 if you were.\u201d She exhales, and her fingers twitch, curl into a fist. \u201cBut you have your moments. Your alien detector?\u201d\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t work on you.\u201d Lena\u2019s eyes narrow, but Kara can see the hurt she\u2019s hiding behind the scowl. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t have said anything. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\nThat stings.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We don\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d\u00a0 Kara sighs, fiddles with her glasses. Where the hell is the uber? \u201cI broke it, so it wouldn\u2019t work on me.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not just tell me?\u201d\n\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Kara trails off.\u00a0 Because Lex is your brother and I can\u2019t count how many times he\u2019s nearly killed Kal. Because I hate the idea that you feel the need to out aliens to the rest of the world. Because I hate that you talk out of both sides of your mouth on alien-human interaction. Because I know you\u2019re trying to unlearn that prejudice and I wanted to give you a chance. \n\u201cBecause of my fucking brother.\u201d Lena digs in her purse and pulls out a cigarette, lighting it and taking a long drag. Kara blinks. She had no idea Lena smoked.\u00a0 \u201cOh this? I quit. Or I keep trying to. Never seems to take.\u201d\u00a0 She takes another long drag and holds it out to Kara. Kara shakes her head. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really blame you for being cautious, but Kara, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d she trails off.\n\u201cStop making those things. Destroy the blueprints.\u201d Kara swallows. \u201cThink about Mindy. She wasn\u2019t ready to come out. Not everyone is ready for the people around them to know who they are or where they\u2019re from. So many of us are just trying to get by on this strange world. So many of us are refugees.\u201d\nThe uber pulls up and they get in. Lena is silent for a long time, almost the entire trip back to Kara\u2019s apartment.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she says as they turn onto Kara\u2019s block. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. It\u2019ll be a nightmare for R&amp;D, but maybe we can figure out some other use for the technology.\u201d\nKara feels her face light up. \u201cReally?\u201d\nLena\u2019s head dips. \u201cYes. Really.\u201d\nWhen Kara kisses her this time, she tastes like smoke, and maybe a little like remorse.\n\n Wednesday\u2014 \n\nThe picture of Kara on Lena\u2019s Instagram of Kara has over 700 comments by the time Kara wakes up the next morning. Kara has close to 500 new followers, which is a little intimidating. But she ignores the new faces in favor of reading the comments. The speculation that Kara might be the new lady in Lena\u2019s life is intense. She\u2019s a little concerned at how many posts are already debating why she looks so sad.\nShe calls Alex.\u00a0 \u201cI told Lena.\u201d\n\u201cTold her what?\u201d Alex asks. There\u2019s rustling in the background. She\u2019s getting ready for work.\u00a0 \u201cThat you think her Instagram followers are scary?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019m an alien.\u201d\n\u201cYou WHAT?\u201d Alex shouts.\u00a0 Kara pulls the phone away from her ear. Alex, when alarmed, is capable of deafening pitch. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I think you just said you told Lena fucking Luthor that you\u2019re Supergirl.\u201d\n\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t tell her that.\u201d Kara protests. \u201cJust that I\u2019m not human. I was trying to explain what happened with James and it just sort of\u2026 happened.\u201d\nAlex groans. \u201cI\u2019m coming over.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be late for work.\u201d\n\u201cThis is more important than J'onn chewing my ass out for tardiness.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKara\u2019s doing her hair when Alex lets herself into the apartment.\u00a0 She\u2019s got three bobby pins in her mouth and just sort of glares at Alex, who glares right back, arms crossed and scowling. \u201cDo you even like her?\u201d Alex demands.\nSpitting out the bobby pins, Kara retorts: \u201cOf course I do, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have said anything!\u201d\n\u201cSo you were what, trying to explain how you and James were perfect and then you just ended things?\u201d Alex runs a hand through her hair, messing it up, realizing what she\u2019s done and groaning. She storms across the room to grab Kara\u2019s hair brush and flat iron. \u201cIs this still hot?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Kara says shortly. She picks up her bobby pins. \u201cNo, I told her how my I liked James and how I couldn\u2019t \u2013 you know what Krypton was like.\u201d\n\u201cClark was right, fucking pandas, all of you.\u201d Alex mutters. \u201cSo you told her about how you\u2019re wired a little different, maybe a little asexual, and somehow the alien thing just\u2026 came up?\u201d She tugs the bit of hair that\u2019s stubbornly sticking forward and attacks it with the flat iron.\u00a0 Kara pins the rest of her hair back and says nothing. Alex pushes, because Alex always pushes. \u201cYou wanted her to understand if you have to end it.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I will.\u201d Kara swallows, just a little nervous. \u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 when she kissed me, it didn\u2019t feel like kissing James. Or Charlie or Jenna or Adam.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you kissed all those people?\u201d\n\u201cI did more than kiss,\u201d Kara mumbles, her cheeks feel like they\u2019re on fire. Alex doesn\u2019t know that. Kara hasn\u2019t really talked about it with anyone.\nAlex\u2019s hand is warm on Kara\u2019s back. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\u201cBecause they weren\u2019t going to last, I knew that.\u201d\n\u201cBut you slept with them anyway?\u201d Alex looks flabbergasted, flat iron in one hand, hair spray in the other. \u201cKara, you shouldn\u2019t feel pressured \u2013\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that what humans want in relationships?\u201d Kara moves to the kitchen to get her lunch together.\u00a0 \u201cSex doesn\u2019t bother me, it\u2019s good for stress relief and if it\u2019s what they want, I can do that. It\u2019s just\u2026 one of those things that I think I\u2019m not as into as most people.\u201d\n\u201cSo it\u2019s different with Lena Luthor?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Kara admits. \u201cI think it might be, though. Kissing her felt different, I felt something that I\u2019ve never felt before. I was too little when I left Krypton to really understand how that worked, but Kal thinks that it is actual attraction. That\u2019s why I told her, because I wanted her to know going into this that it could get\u2026 intense for me.\u201d\n\u201cI think it does a disservice to asexual people everywhere if you suddenly stop being ace\u2026ish just because you met the right person.\u201d Alex shuts off the flat iron and sprays her hair once more with hair spray. \u201cIsn\u2019t that exactly what they hate hearing. It\u2019s like you telling me to find the right guy.\u201d\n\u201cI never said that,\u201d Kara points out, Alex rolls her eyes. And okay, maybe Kara implied it. And she definitely feels guilty about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s it, though\u2026 \u201d She shoves her lunch into her lunch bag and glances at Alex. \u201cLike, I don\u2019t even think I am\u2026 like that. It isn\u2019t that, it\u2019s the years on Krypton telling me that relationships are about power, not love or desire.\u201d\n\u201cWell, she is powerful.\u201d\n\u201cSo was James! So was Adam! Jenna was the student body president!\u201d Kara could tear her hair out, but she doesn\u2019t mention Cat, because that never happened, but that would have sealed the deal. \u201cIt just never fit because I was fighting so hard against that instinct.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now it does fit.\u201d Alex sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you.\u201d\nKara bites her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d And somehow, that admission feels hollow.\n\u00a0\nThere are two press conferences to cover before lunch, and it isn\u2019t until Kara gets back to the office that she finds Snapper Carr leaning against her office door with a cup of coffee and a pensive look on his face. \u201cLena Luthor isn\u2019t following the script again.\u201d\nWhat now? Kara frowns. \u201cWhat do you mean, sir?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s called a presser, three-ten this afternoon. You\u2019re covering. It\u2019s about some alien detection tech she\u2019s developing.\u201d\nKara feels the lump reappear in the back of her throat and she coughs before nodding. \u201cOf course. How many words?\u201d\n\u201cDepends on what she has to say.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLena is wearing all white when she steps up to the podium in the L-Corp building\u2019s lobby.\u00a0 All white and bright red lipstick to go with her bright red nails.\u00a0 It\u2019s the nails Kara\u2019s drawn to, and how bright they look against the white of Lena\u2019s knuckles against the podium.\u00a0 Lena is hanging on so tight, and Kara has no idea why. Her face is impassive, though, and it\u2019s only in her fingertips that Kara can sense the trepidation in Lena.\nShe launches into a discussion of the previous quarter\u2019s gains and pauses for questions. Kara gets one in about charitable donations, which were clumped together in Lena\u2019s run down and in the print out distributed by Lena\u2019s secretary.\u00a0 Lena runs through the list off the top of her head and Kara jots everything down. There\u2019s a few organizations she doesn\u2019t recognize, and a few more she wants to check into before she decides that they\u2019re all above-board.\n\u201cAnd secondly, I want to discuss a new piece of research that we think could prove very exciting.\u00a0 Next week, the journal Science is going to be publishing a peer-reviewed article about an alien-detection device that we\u2019ve been working on developing for some time.\u201d\u00a0 Lena pauses, and her eyes seek out Kara.\u00a0 Kara feels her blood go cold. She couldn\u2019t \u2013 she wouldn\u2019t. Lena inhales, and continues. Kara snaps her pen in half. \u201cWhile this device was created with good intentions, L-Corp has come to believe that this technology could be used for ill in its current state.\u00a0 We are going to be pulling the researchers who conducted the peer review into a few meetings to determine if there is a potential future for this technology and research, potentially within the medical field. The article in Science was perhaps allowed to go forward too early, before the events of the past few weeks here in National City took place. I cannot, in good conscious, allow this study to be published without addressing it first. I would like to take the opportunity to assure any alien resident of National City, or the world, that this device in its current form will never see the light of day.\u201d\nKara, covered in ink and scribbling furiously with a borrowed pen, meets Lena\u2019s eyes and nods, just once. Lena\u2019s grip on the podium relaxes. She takes questions.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2026 isn\u2019t a good press day for L-Corp. Kara writes a pretty scathing article and Snapper approves it with only minor edits.\u00a0 The company stock dips a bit and then a lot. Cat sends an annoyed message about her investment portfolio hidden in a compliment about the bite to the article.\u00a0 Kara sends her a polite one back citing anti-alien bigotry in her investments and Cat responds with a series of emojis that sort of make sense but mostly just confuse Kara.\nSo Kara calls her.\n\u201cForgive me for having a diverse portfolio.\u201d Cat says it in lieu of a greeting. \u201cBut rest assured, if you want it dropped, I will call my broker as soon as we\u2019re through.\u201d\nKara doesn\u2019t really know what to say, because Cat\u2019s offering her something Kara never thought possible or reasonable: humanity without even an ounce of judgment.\u00a0 She knows how Kara feels about alien rights (probably because she knows Kara is Supergirl and is just \u2026 not mentioning it) and she\u2019s respecting that though her actions. Kara doesn\u2019t want Cat to stop investing in Lena\u2019s company though, because Lena did the same thing, she took a massive hit in the press in order to keep a promise to Kara. So she settles on the background because that, at least, feels safe. \u201cShe showed me it, ages ago. Last night, I told her to destroy it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she just did it?\u201d Cat sounds amused, interested. \u201cLittle Kara Danvers, got the elite of National City wrapped around your finger now, don\u2019t you? A regular Lois Lane.\u201d\n\u201cI think her relationship with those in power is much more hate than love, Ms. Grant.\u201d\n\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d Cat says. \u201cI\u2019m impressed that you\u2019ve managed to gain so much clout with a Luthor in such a short time.\u00a0 You Millennials and your social media-based friendships, I always forget how easy it is for elbows to rub across social class.\u201d\nKara bristles at the insinuation, but that\u2019s just how Cat is, she\u2019s pretty used to it. But she doesn\u2019t want Cat to get any wrong ideas about these things, so she says, perhaps all in one breath: \u201cWell, that and Snapper\u2019s been having me cover her and L-Corp a lot.\u201d\n\u201cOh, so it\u2019s not just an Instagram friendship of convenience now?\u201d Cat is actually laughing now.\u00a0 \u201cGood for you, Kara. She\u2019s a lovely girl, perhaps a step down if you look at your past relationships, though. She\u2019s still wet behind the ears.\u201d\nAnd Kara, feeling suddenly emboldened and just a little curious, asks a stupid question. \u201cYou being that past relationship, Ms. Grant?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Cat says and she sounds nostalgic. \u201cCall it a might-have been. I\u2014I miss you, Kara. It\u2019s very quiet in my life without you zipping in and out.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you up to then?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t exactly tell a reporter just yet, now can I?\u201d\n\u201cCould you tell a friend?\u201d Kara tries not to sound hopeful. \u201cI mean, if you wanted to?\u201d She\u2019s kept far bigger secrets for Cat than this.\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Cat says. \u201cBut it\u2019s too soon, and you\u2019ve got something else brewing, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so-sorry?\u201d At this point, Kara\u2019s completely lost. Cat\u2019s speaking in layers and it drives Kara up the wall when she does that. Mixed signals. Kara chews on her fingernail.\n\u201cThe Luthor girl. She put that picture of you up on her picture feed for a reason, Kara. It\u2019s staking a claim. Ballsy, but not without merit.\u201d\n\u201cMs. Grant, I...\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m merely concerned, Kara. She\u2019s a Luthor, and you\u2019re, well...\u201d Kara does, but she\u2019s grateful that Cat doesn\u2019t voice the truth.\u00a0 \u201cShe took a risk for her company, and she did it just for you. That\u2019s interesting. Wonder who\u2019s side she\u2019s on.\u201d And Cat hangs up, leaving Kara confused.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think Ms. Grant knows.\u201d Kara ducks under a beam and peers through the gloom.\u00a0 There\u2019s supposed a CADMUS weapons cache somewhere around here, according to the guy they caught the other day who shot up the #alienswelcome protest. The guy who knew old Kryptonese insults and how to hurt someone from Kandor with just a word. Kara\u2019s still very suspicious of him, but J'onn won\u2019t let her into the interrogation room to find out more about him.\nAlex trains her flashlight against the wall, and Kara looks past the walls to see if there are any chemical signatures still radiating that suggest off-world technology. She stares through them and sees the grains in the wood, the clapboard and the molecules of atoms vibrating, locked in tight concert to create steel beams. There\u2019s nothing alien here, just lots of slur-laden graffiti.\n\u201cDamn, you\u2019re just a parade of telling secrets today, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Alex grumbles. She pans her flashlight over the graffiti. \u201cAlso, you\u2019re still talking to her?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s a friend.\u201d Kara shrugs. \u201cI talk to her from time to time. She doesn\u2019t approve of my being friends with Lena Luthor.\u201d\n\u201cThe woman has sense.\u201d Alex mutters.\nIgnoring Alex, Kara contemplates the red paint on the walls. #ETGOHOME is everywhere. She touches it, and her fingers come away wet. \u201cDo you think it bothers Spielberg that they\u2019re stealing a line from his movie for their protest?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he cares one way or the other. He\u2019s been noticeably mute on this issue. But he\u2019s also got buckets of money to put toward the cause, if he\u2019s so inclined.\u201d Alex pulls out her camera and passes Kara the flashlight.\u00a0 \u201cThe DEO used to be this bad, you know. Before \u2013\u201d\n\u201cBefore Superman?\u201d\n\u201cAnd the JLA.\u201d Alex snaps a photograph of the wall. Kara, after a moment\u2019s thought, pulls out her phone from the pocket in her lower back and takes a few of her own. She\u2019s got an idea for a story that might pique Snapper\u2019s interest, and having the documentation isn\u2019t a bad idea.\u00a0 \u201cWhen J'onn took over, hell, when I started, we\u2019d just lock up any alien we encountered. I sometimes wonder what side we\u2019re on.\u201d\n\u201cWell, the president, she\u2014\u201d\nAlex holds up her hand, unclipping her gun and drawing it in a fluid motion.\u00a0 Kara passes her back the flashlight wordlessly.\u00a0 There\u2019s movement, somewhere on the edges of building. A chain-link fence rattling.\u00a0 Kara glances at Alex, who nods, before lunging forward, pushing her body faster and faster into action.\u00a0 She lives for moments like this, when she can spin through spaces at speeds that make her mind dizzy. Kara draws breath, her hand shooting out, grabbing the collar of the interloper \u2013 slim, dark hair, feminine build, carrying a signal jammer and\u2026\n\u201cLena?\u201d\n\n\nThursday \u2013 \n\n\nIt\u2019s after midnight and Kara is pacing the length of the DEO bullpen, back and forth, back and forth, glaring down the hallway to the interrogation rooms. She wants to be in there, she wants to know what the hell Lena was doing in there.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to wear a hole in the floor,\u201d Winn comments from where he\u2019s paging through Lena\u2019s life. He\u2019s got the L-Corp holdings pulled up on his computer and is bumping them up against a list of known CADMUS sympathizers. \u201cWhich probably isn\u2019t going to improve Henshaw\u2019s mood.\u201d\nKara\u2019s fingers flex and she spins, splintering the linoleum under her toe.\u00a0 J'onn can just try with her after what he said to her when Alex called in the intruder to the compound.\u00a0 He can just try.\n\nWe\u2019ve been waiting for this.\n\nA frustrated sound escapes Kara\u2019s lips.\nWinn sighs and sits back, playing with his pen. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\nKara exhales heavily through her nostrils. They flare.\u00a0 Winn eyes her, skeptical. \u201cI just want to know why she was there. She has no business being there. Not with what she was carrying. Not dressed like a cat burglar.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes, the signal jammer and the collection of surveillance equipment that\u2019s so cutting edge that we don\u2019t even have some of it.\u201d Winn lets out a low whistle. \u201cIf she was the one who built it, I would love to pick her brain.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Kara says just a little forcefully, just a little rudely. She doesn\u2019t want Winn to spend time with Lena if she\u2019s about to get locked up. That isn\u2019t fair \u2013 she\u2019s Kara\u2019s \u2013 and wow if that thought isn\u2019t just a little too intense and primal for Kara\u2019s liking.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Winn grumbles. \u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t tell you what she was up to, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be\u2026 like, bad bad?\u201d He clicks his pen. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about how there\u2019s someone on her social media who knows how to stay words that really push your buttons and how they\u2019re bandying them about like slurs for anyone who\u2019s pro-alien. The #ETGOHOME guys are clearly in the loop when it comes to alien knowledge. They could even be aliens.\u201d\n\u201cHow could aliens want that?\u201d Kara says. But she\u2019s already thinking about it. It\u2019s the same, age-old issue that\u2019s been at the edge of her mind since she first started to realize that there were other aliens running around on earth besides herself and Kal. There are good ones, and bad ones, and folk who fall somewhere in the middle of both of those two extremes. Kara knows this. She\u2019s known this for ages and yet somehow, what Winn\u2019s suggesting seems almost comically implausible. Like the sort of thing that could only happen in the movies, never in real life. Aliens protesting against an alien presence? That\u2019s farcical.\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re just sick of the Fort Rozz types going around and messing things up for them?\u201d Winn suggests. \u201cIt can\u2019t be easy, just being an average Joe sort of alien and not being able to just be because people are too obsessed with the scary ones.\u201d\nKara sucks her lower lip into her mouth and scowls. Because it makes sense.\u00a0\n\u201cI guess. I honestly haven\u2019t ever really thought about it\u2026 or my role in all of that.\u201d Kara runs a hand through her hair and it gets caught in a tangle. She winces. And tugs it out. \u201cBut Lena\u2026 she was in a place with that \u2013 those \u2013 that\u2019s where the #ETGOHOME idiots have set up their home base.\u201d\u00a0 Kara gestures helplessly. \u201cThat isn\u2019t good, Winn. How the hell did she even know about it?\u201d\n\u201cI followed you there, well, I followed Agent Danvers.\u201d Kara and Winn turn as one, to see Lena standing beside J'onn and Alex, looking tired with her hands jammed into her pockets. J'onn's got the grim sort of look on his face that says that he\u2019s had far, far too long a night and Alex just looks exhausted. But Lena hasn\u2019t been thrown in a cell somewhere, which Kara thinks is an improvement.\u00a0 She brightens, but then remembers that this is Supergirl, not Kara, so she coughs.\nLena looks up at Kara through her lashes, and her lips quirk and her tone turns flirty. \u201cI hope that was alright, Supergirl.\u201d\nThere\u2019s something about the way that Lena says \u2018Supergirl\u2019 that tells Kara that the cat\u2019s out of the bag, and Lena\u2019s playing coy with the truth.\u00a0 Kara looks to Alex for confirmation, but Alex is busy with something on her phone. Kara\u2019s cheeks burn and she coughs to cover the awkward silence that\u2019s brewing. \u201cIt probably isn\u2019t a good idea for a civilian to enter an area like that.\u201d\n\u201cI was armed.\u201d Lena points out. Kara resists the urge to roll her eyes.\n\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d\nLena moves to stand behind Winn. \u201cMay I?\u201d she asks, gesturing to the computer.\nWinn throws a nervous glance over his shoulder at J'onn, who nods, just once. \u201cDon\u2019t break anything.\u201d He says, getting up. \u201cAnd don\u2019t adjust anything.\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d\u00a0 Lena closes out of his program in a few clicks and Kara loses track of what Lena\u2019s doing after she inserts a flash drive and starts to open files. She runs the DEO's software through some sort of encryption algorithm before she pulls up a series of email accounts and\u2026 her Instagram feed? Kara takes a step forward, arms wrapped around herself.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve been tracking the #ETGOHOME protests for some time, ever since the first one.\u00a0 I wanted to be able to bring the correct people to the CatCo symposium\u2026provided that\u2019s still on?\u201d Her gaze slides to Kara and Kara groans inwardly. She totally knows.\u00a0 Fuck.\n\u201cI\u2019ll er\u2014ask Kara about that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably see her before you do, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Lena keeps going, conversationally. Alex coughs. Kara looks over her shoulder, and Alex is glaring at her.\u00a0 Told you so her expression says. Kara turns back to Lena and pretends not to notice. \u201cA few weeks before the first #ETGOHOME protest in National City we had a small hack down in R&amp;D. Nothing too major, but that was when the news of alien detection device first started to leak to the fringe parts of the Internet. We had a full lid on that device. The NDAs we had the peer reviewers sign were unbreakable. So when word started to get out about it, and after the hack, I assigned some of the more ah, skilled members of our IT department to look into it. I knew, given the nature of the protests cropping up ever since the president\u2019s law passed, that there\u2019d be a connection between those protesters. So I assigned our IT crew to keep closer track of who\u2019s posting in the #ETGOHOME hashtag and who\u2019s geotagged as being at the protests via social media. They found an interesting connection.\u201d\nLena pauses, opens a video file. Winn leans forward. \u201cThat\u2019s when the protests turned violent.\u201d Kara\u2019s seen this video before. They had it on loop over the weekend, watching over and over as the two protests clashed, looking that the concussive force of that weapon and trying to figure out where it came from.\n\u201cLook who started the initial fight.\u201d She opens a window and zooms in on a young woman\u2019s picture and a collection of social media accounts.\u00a0 Then she flips back to a frame grabbed from a video clearly clipped from Snapchat.\u00a0 \u201cSame girl.\u201d\nKara\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cThat\u2019s one of your Instagram followers. Like one of the five you follow back.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose I should be flattered that you read my feed so closely, Supergirl.\u201d Lena\u2019s tone is still light, still flirty. Kara can practically feel Alex glaring at her, admonishing her in her mind. Kara\u2019s screwed up, she knows it now. \u201cBut I actually follow eleven people.\u201d\nWinn tilts his head. \u201cIs that a facial recognition algorithm that interacts with Snapchat? Because if so\u2026 can you tell me how it works?\u201d\n\u201cTrade secrets, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Lena says. \u201cThe DEO is welcome to bid on the tech when we release it.\u201d She\u2019s looking Kara as though daring her to comment, daring her to say anything that\u2019d be confirmation.\n\u201cSo what do we do about it?\u201d Alex asks. She\u2019s moving forward now. \u201cPrint that.\u201d\u00a0 Winn leans forward and shows her where the printer key is on his self-built system. \u201cIf this girl is who you claim she is, Ms. Luthor, we\u2019ve got a bigger problem.\u00a0 She\u2019s got an alien connection of her own, or she could be one herself, that weapon she used to start the first series of fights wasn\u2019t something to play with.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I think the first thing is to go back to that warehouse and put in my surveillance equipment.\u201d Lena says. \u201cThat\u2019s their base of operation.\u201d She picks up Winn\u2019s pen and tugs a sticky note off of the stack by his desk.\u00a0 J'onn\u2019s been on Winn about leaving company secrets on sticky notes, but for now, Kara actually appreciates it, as Lena\u2019s writing down her number for Supergirl and pressing it into her hand. \u201cI figure that you\u2019ll want to be in touch.\u201d\n\u201cI could just get your number form Agent Danvers,\u201d Kara says, tucking the sticky note into her sleeve. \u201cBut I agree with you that if that is the base of operation, we need to keep an eye on it.\u201d She looks to J'onn. \u201cAre you comfortable using Ms. Luthor\u2019s equipment?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it.\u201d J'onn steps forward and takes control of the situation, barking out orders and telling Kara to take Lena home, but not before Winn checks her cell phone and ensures that the DEO has tracking on it.\u00a0 Lena\u2019s not too keen on that, but surrenders the device without much of a fight. Winn chats with her, smiling at her. Kara\u2019s fingers twitch and she wants to tell him to go away, the words struggle to escape her throat and she\u2019s just\u2026 she can\u2019t get it out.\n\u00a0\nKara ties a blindfold around Lena\u2019s eyes, her fingers gentle. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I have to do it this way\u2026 but you can\u2019t know where the base is.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Lena says. \u201cBetter than the bag over my head when we came here.\u201d\n\u201cAre you okay with me flying you back to your office?\u201d Kara asks. \u201cBecause we can drive too. Or go to your apartment\u2026 but you\u2019d have to tell me where it is.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m having a hard time picturing Supergirl in a car.\u201d Lena chuckles.\u00a0 She fiddles with the blindfold. \u201cI don\u2019t care much for flying, but I suppose it is quicker than trying to get an uber at this hour.\u201d\nKara\u2019s fingers twitch. She wants to kiss Lena like this, to see if she\u2019d be able to tell. To actually feel compelled to kiss someone is alarming for Kara, but not\u2026 all together unpleasant.\u00a0 She puts away the information and takes Lena\u2019s hand, pulling it gently away from the blindfold.\u00a0 \u201cWell, I\u2019m happy to be of service.\u201d She really does like to please.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going to put my arms around your waist, alright? I want you to keep your head down, because I don\u2019t want to hurt you when I turn.\u201d\n\u201cG-forces?\u201d Lena asks.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Kara says. \u201cI like to go fast.\u201d\n\u201cSounds fun, minus the whiplash.\u201d Lena steps forward in the general direction of Kara. Her hands rest on Kara\u2019s shoulders, sliding down across the insignia of the House of El. It\u2019s such an intimate gesture, that when Kara\u2019s trembling hands settle on Lena\u2019s hips and pull her even closer, the urge to kiss Lena is so strong that Kara feels as though she\u2019s going to die if she doesn\u2019t do something. Lena\u2019s fingers come up to grip the edges of the cape that falls around them both.\u00a0 \u201cKara,\u201d she whispers, and her tone is so insistent, so pleading, that Kara aches inside for want to kiss her. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell.\u201d\nShe can\u2019t though. She can\u2019t kiss Lena. Can\u2019t do anything other than grip Lena tighter and pull her from her feet to fling them both from the waiting window. Lena can\u2019t know about Supergirl, even if she\u2019s guessed.\u00a0 Confirmation isn\u2019t an option. Not until Kara\u2019s sure.\n(And Kara isn\u2019t sure she\u2019s ever going to be sure.)\n\u00a0\nWork is slow, it drags on a scant few hours of sleep. Kara\u2019s still looking through that data for Snapper and emailing back and forth with James and Lena about the round table CatCo\u2019s still going forward with on alien rights.\u00a0 Lena supplies the troubling details regarding the involvement of her Instagram follower, and Kara has the good sense to pretend to be horrified. It\u2019s pretty transparent, and James IMs her privately to tell her that she\u2019s about as obvious as snow on a mountainside.\u00a0 Kara tells him that she doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\u00a0\nOlsen, James: You really shouldn\u2019t be talking about that stuff over company computers. Think about how easily they could be hacked.\nDanvers, Kara: You forget that the guy who built our security currently works for a top secret government organization.\nOlsen, James: I know, but I worry. Especially given the apparently technical prowess of L-Corp. I don\u2019t want any corporate espionage.\nDanvers, Kara: You\u2019re being exceptionally paranoid.\nOlsen, James: Once a Luthor, always a Luthor. They\u2019re bad eggs.\nDanvers, Kara: I happen to like that egg.\n\nOlsen, James is typing\u2026\n\nDanvers, Kara: In a totally platonic, in-no-way-did-she-kiss-me sort of way.\n\nOlsen, James has entered text.\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d Kara says. Maybe that wasn\u2019t the best thing to tell him, but she\u2019s never been particularly good at keeping secrets from people. And it\u2019s so different with Lena that she forgets that maybe not everyone is going to be supportive.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost cruel to James, to make it worse in trying to counter the awkwardness of this.\nDanvers, Kara: I\u2019m sorry.\n\nOlsen, James is typing\u2026\n\nOlsen, James: I suppose we were going to have this conversation sooner or later. I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be about her, gotta say.\nOlsen, James: Does Clark know?\nDanvers, Kara: That depends on if you\u2019re going to tell him.\n\nOlsen, James has entered text.\n\nTime stretches on, on and on and on. James doesn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0 Kara twitches, fidgets, stares at the time stamp, breaks her pen in half.\u00a0 Finally, after going to the bathroom to wash off her hand, she pulls up the IM window and types a short message.\u00a0 She will not be ignored.\n\nOlsen, James has entered text.\n\nDanvers, Kara: I\u2019m coming upstairs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt is, Kara will admit to Alex later, the first real fight she\u2019s ever had with James.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t even fight when they broke up. She goes up to Cat\u2019s old office and pulls him out on the balcony so they can yell at each other without anyone knowing.\u00a0 Kara yells.\u00a0 She punches a hole in the railing and James throws a flower pot. Kara was never there when it was bad with Lex, he says. Kara was never there when Clark almost died, he says. Kara never knew about how shit it was for Clark watching his best friend turn into the monster that is Lex Luthor, how could she, she was squirreled away on the other side of the country.\u00a0 That family is poison, awful toxic kryptonite that will destroy her if she lets them get too close.\nKara pushes back, because it isn\u2019t fair of him to tell her who she can and cannot see.\u00a0 They broke up, didn\u2019t they?\u00a0 That\u2019s when James throws the flower pot, tells Kara that he\u2019s still upset about it when Kara thought they were cool.\u00a0 The railing crumbles under her hands.\u00a0 Cat\u2019s going to murder her when she gets back, but Kara can\u2019t get her hands to stop shaking. She swallows. James is making this about him and about Clark. \u201cClark shut me out, James. He left me with the Danverses because that was where he thought I could be safe. He was 25 and in no position to parent someone older than him!\u201d Kara draws a breath, and then another. \u201cI\u2019m not him, James. Lena\u2019s not Lex.\u201d She scowls. \u201cDefining women by the men in their lives when the men in their lives threw them away when they were needed the most \u2013 that\u2019s cold, cruel.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\u201cThink about your words.\u201d Kara grinds out.\u00a0 She stands well away from anything, because the anger is back, and it isn\u2019t about James. It really isn\u2019t. \u201cThink about what you\u2019re saying. You know how hard this is for me, James.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me too.\u201d\n\u201cYou have Lucy.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel sad about losing you.\u201d\nThe fight isn\u2019t about Kara or James, or Clark or Lex or Lena. Or Lucy Lane and her pretty smile and the fact that James was probably still in love with her the entire time he and Kara had their thing. It\u2019s about so much that they\u2019re not talking about and Kara goes home feeling absolutely miserable. About the clash between their two cultures that\u2019s resulted in protests and violence in the streets, in twitter wars and controversial new laws. James isn\u2019t anti-alien by any means, but the tension is still there, still simmering. There\u2019s a cultural clash. And it cuts Kara up inside, because James was supposed to get it. \u00a0She calls Alex, who comes over with pizza and holds her while she cries great shaking sobs into her clenched fists, grinding the smooth stones Alex tucks into her hands into dust.\u00a0\nLater, when Alex has dozed off on the couch and Kara\u2019s tucked her under a blanket and moved her so she\u2019s curled on her side, Kara calls Lena.\u00a0 She goes up to the roof of her building, where she can see the L-Corp building and stares up at illuminated lights of the executive floor, one of the few still illuminated at this late hour.\u00a0\n\u201cI had a fight with James.\u201d Kara says. Lena is typing.\u00a0 She pauses when Kara\u2019s voice hitches.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat about?\u201d The concern that seeps into her voice is gentle, kind, and exactly what Kara wants to hear.\n\u201cYou.\u201d\nLena sighs. \u201cHad you not mentioned us to him?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kara screws up her face.\u00a0 \u201cLook \u2013 could I come over? You\u2019re still at the office. I just\u2026 need a neutral space.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYour building is pretty close to my place, I can see your lights on from the roof.\u201d Kara says. \u201cWith the hit you guys took yesterday, I figured you\u2019d still be working.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong.\u201d Lena\u2019s typing again. She pauses, hits the spacebar on her laptop loud enough to be heard across the line. \u201cMy office is my turf, Kara, that\u2019s hardly neutral.\u201d\nBut Kara\u2019s already pushing off her feet and drifting into the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s what I need, right now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJess is watching the football game on one of her monitors. She barely glances up from her stack of paperwork and outgoing mail that makes Kara wince with sympathy when Kara drifts into the reception area of the L-Corp offices.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re up late.\u201d She says, tone deliberately mild. Distaste colors her features for a moment, but that could have something to do with the play on screen.\u00a0 National City is playing the Metropolis Sharks tonight.\u00a0 If she hadn\u2019t had that awful fight with James, she might be out with him and Winn, watching the game in a bar somewhere. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good time.\u201d\n\u201cShe knows I\u2019m coming,\u201d Kara answers, crossing to the elevator and pushing the call button.\u00a0 \u201cI called ahead.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t call me.\u201d Jess scowls. \u201cI keep her schedule.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I doubt she\u2019s got meetings scheduled at eleven o\u2019clock at night.\u201d Kara steps into the elevator when it arrives. It\u2019s with a wicked, slightly mischievous smile that she certainly does not feel beyond a want to annoy Jess, that she says: \u201cGoodnight, Jess.\u201d\nJess just glares as the elevator doors close.\n\u00a0\nLena is bathed in a pool of lamplight when Kara arrives in her office. She\u2019s curled up at her desk, her shoes off and cup of steaming coffee beside her. The throw blanket from the couch is around her shoulders and her feet are tucked up under her. She looks frazzled, but alright, as tired as Kara feels.\n\u201cI almost expected you to just materialize,\u201d Lena says, reaching for her coffee. There\u2019s a lipstick stain on the lip. \u201cOr is that not what you do?\u201d\nKara shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s never really been my thing.\u201d She steps forward, and then, faster than she should move, she\u2019s behind Lena, staring out the window. \u201cI can move quickly, though, when motivated.\u201d\n\u201cTo look at my view?\u201d Lena gets to her feet.\u00a0 She seems unbothered by Kara\u2019s rapid movement, but when she comes to stand beside Kara, her fingers brush up against Kara\u2019s forearm, as though to make sure she\u2019s still there, still real. They stand there, for a moment, Lena just barely touching Kara, looking down at the city. The throw is discarded on her chair. \u201cWhere\u2019s your building?\u201d Lena asks.\nIt takes a minute of looking through the buildings to find Alex, sleeping on her couch. Everything looks a bit different from this position. When she has her bearings, Kara points. \u201cThere. I left my sister sleeping on my couch.\u201d\n\u201cSo you can\u2019t stay long?\u201d Lena asks. There\u2019s something about her that makes the hairs on the back of Kara\u2019s neck stand on end, the way she leans in, just a little too close, the way she smells like old fashioned perfume and just the hint of a bad decision.\u00a0 It all settles at the pit of Kara\u2019s stomach like something forbidden and tantalizing.\nAnd maybe it\u2019s Kara who bobs to Lena\u2019s weave, or maybe it\u2019s the other way around, but Lena\u2019s kissing Kara gently, her fingers twining with Kara\u2019s. She\u2019s soft with exhaustion. Kara can feel it in the way she takes shortcuts, tugging and pulling until she\u2019s sitting back in her chair and Kara\u2019s pulled into her lap.\u00a0 When they break, and Kara\u2019s got lipstick smeared across her mouth and Lena\u2019s looking up at her like she\u2019s the entire sun, Kara bumps their foreheads together.\u00a0 \u201cYou work too much.\u201d She rubs her thumb across Lena\u2019s lower lip, fixing where her lipstick is smudged.\n\u201cSo do you,\u201d Lena points out, and there\u2019s a layer of implication there that makes Kara\u2019s stomach flutter uncomfortably. \u201cBut I have to work. I\u2019m the only person who can make this company profitable again.\u201d She doesn\u2019t mention the stock hit she took on Kara\u2019s behalf, or the series of interviews she\u2019s done on a few local radio stations, and a few senior CatCo reporters trying to undo the damage she did at Kara\u2019s behest. Kara doesn\u2019t mention it either. \u201cSacrifices of sleep can be made, I think, once and a while to do a job well.\u201d\nLena\u2019s fingers are on Kara\u2019s hips, holding her steady, dipping just below the thin cotton of her shirt. Kara curls into her shoulder, lips brushing against Lena\u2019s neck, marveling at how Lena shivers at the contact.\u00a0 \u201cAm I distracting you?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a welcome distraction.\u201d\nLena\u2019s desk chair rolls then, and they both lurch to the side.\u00a0 Kara laughs, pressing a kiss to Lena\u2019s nose and getting off her lap. \u201cWe\u2019re going to die if we stay in that chair,\u201d she says.\n\u201cYou might be right.\u201d Lena\u2019s powering down her laptop and stacking papers on top of it.\u00a0 She leans over her desk and her necklace trails down almost brushing the clean white surface of it. Kara\u2019s filled with this incredible urge to reach forward and wrap it around her fingers, to use it to bring Lena back to her.\u00a0 She tucks her hands into the back pockets of her jeans, biting at her lip while Lena shoves the stack of laptop and papers into her purse.\u00a0 \u201cDo you want to get out of here?\u201d\nThere\u2019s nothing Kara wants more. She pulls out her phone and texts Alex that she\u2019s gone out and not to worry. Lena puts her shoes back on and rises to almost Kara\u2019s height before getting her coat and putting the throw back on the couch. Kara follows her out of the office, waiting while Lena turns off lights and locks up. Lena hands her a tissue as they get on the elevator. \u201cFor the,\u201d she gestures to Kara\u2019s lips. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a good shade on you.\u201d\nKara had completely forgotten. She scrubs dutifully, and is mostly put back together by the time the elevator opens. Jess is still scowling when they go past her desk, but she\u2019s wrapping up.\u00a0 Lena asks her about the outgoing reports, and what the numbers are looking like in Tokyo and Shanghai; Jess replies promptly and Lena brightens a little. Good news, it seems.\u00a0 She glances over her shoulder at Kara at something Jess says and shrugs.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll see in the morning.\u00a0 Come in at eleven. It\u2019s been a long night and I can manage without you for a few hours.\u201d\n\u201cYou should sleep too, Ms. Luthor.\u201d Jess glares at Kara.\nKara turns bright red, the implication lays heavy in the air around them.\u00a0 The back of Lena\u2019s neck is red. Jess begins to get her things together, her hair falling into her face.\n\u201cI intend to, Jess,\u201d Lena says curtly. She pulls her ID out of her purse and turns to Kara.\u00a0 \u201cShall we?\u201d\n\n\nFriday - \n\n\nLena\u2019s apartment is a loft in the arts district and is smaller than Kara expected. Its cozy, decorated in the same clean, sleek way her office is. Everything in its place, but with a far more homey touch than her austere workspace.\u00a0 Lena leaves her things by the door and yawns.\u00a0 Kara toes off her sneakers.\n\u201cI just want to sleep.\u201d Lena says. \u201cIf that\u2019s alright. It has been a very, very long day.\u201d\nIt\u2019s honestly the nicest thing anyone\u2019s ever said to her in a situation like this. A lifeline, something she doesn\u2019t need to take, but at the same time, one she definitely will. \u201cThat\u2019s all I want too.\u201d\nLena sets her keys in a dish on the breakfast bar and scoops up her mail, crossing to a device tucked away in the corner of her kitchen.\u00a0 Kara leans on the breakfast bar and watches as Lena runs each piece of mail through the device \u2013 a scanner - and then checks each piece of junk mail and catalogue over for signs of tampering before throwing them into recycling bin.\u00a0 \u201cDo you want this Bed, Bath and Beyond coupon?\u201d\nKara shakes her head. She\u2019d never get over there before it expired. Lena shrugs and pitches it as well. Lena sets her actual mail beside her keys, presumably to be looked at in the morning and glances around.\u00a0 \u201cOkay.\u201d She seems to come to a decision, seems to settle herself to the point where she can relax. \u201cDo\u2026 you need anything special to sleep?\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to care if I take off my pants? I get hot.\u201d\nLena gives Kara a look that strips her naked. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, rolling the words. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind at all.\u201d\nThe bedroom is behind a half-wall to provide the illusion of privacy.\u00a0 Lena rummages in a few drawers and under the bathroom counter before finding a spare tooth brush for Kara and changing into her pajamas. Kara brushes her teeth and then vacates the bathroom to inspect Lena\u2019s bookshelves. She pulls books off at random, noting that the books on electrical engineering and architecture seem to be the most well-read. There are only a few novels. Most of the fiction Lena keeps are short story anthologies.\u00a0 There are a handful of family pictures around.\u00a0 Kara stares up at a smiling Lex Luthor with his arm around Lena, clad in a graduation cap and gown, her expression growing dark.\nMaybe this isn\u2019t a good idea.\nBut then she remembers Astra, she remembers Non. Is that not the same? Wouldn\u2019t Kara kill for some sort of documentation of the better times she\u2019d shared with them?\n\u201cWe can\u2019t choose our family.\u201d Lena says, eyeing the photograph when she comes back in from the bathroom.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s one of the happiest days of my life, one of my happiest memories of Lex\u2026 yet I know who he is and what he\u2019s done.\u201d\nKara nods and turns away.\u00a0 Lena\u2019s face is scrubbed free of makeup and her hair\u2019s braided loosely down her back. She\u2019s wearing a t-shirt with the MIT crest printed on it and leggings and is turning down the bed.\n\u201cI um, I sleep on this side.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Kara sits on the edge of the bed and shimmies out of her jeans and unclips her bra underneath her shirt.\u00a0 She leaves both in a pile on the floor, retreating under the covers before her semi-nakedness can draw wandering eyes.\u00a0 Not yet, not yet. But she wants it. She\u2019s exhausted now, and it\u2019s really hitting her. Lena\u2019s bed smells good, Lena smells good, and this is\u2026 this is what Kara wants.\n\u201cYou said you were a refugee,\u201d Lena says, drowsily, turning off the light. \u201cSay something in your native language.\u201d\nKara rolls over onto her back, staring up at the blackness above them.\u00a0 She looks up, through it, into nothing. \u201cGoodnight, Lena,\u201d she says quietly. Lena\u2019s name with Kryptonian inflection is beautiful. \u00a0She follows it with a prayer \u2013 a call to Rao to rise again on the morrow \u2013 and it\u2019s as Lena\u2019s fingers tangle in Kara\u2019s hair and tilt her head sideways to press a sleepy, gentle kiss to Kara\u2019s lips that Kara realizes that she hasn\u2019t said this prayer since she arrived on earth.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s Lena\u2019s phone that wakes Kara up in the morning, vibrating gently under the pillow. Lena stirs, curls further into Kara, and goes still once more.\u00a0 Kara doesn\u2019t dare breathe for fear of waking her.\u00a0 She stays perfectly still, allowing herself to relax into the slow, steady breathing of sleep once more. Lena\u2019s fingers are fisted in Kara\u2019s shirt, she got her other arm tucked under the pillow and her lips are parted. Kara wants to kiss her, but not without her consent. Not without her being awake to say yes.\nThe phone buzzes again and this time Lena makes an annoyed grunt, fumbles for it under Kara\u2019s pillow, and silences it.\u00a0 She rolls onto her back and blinks at the screen. It\u2019s six-thirty. Someone\u2019s sent her a direct message on Instagram.\n\u201c\u2019s too early,\u201d Kara grumbles, turning over. Lena\u2019s crazy followers can wait until Kara\u2019s feeling less groggy. And after she\u2019s consumed at least a pot of coffee.\nBut Lena\u2019s prodding her in the side. \u201cCan you get in touch with Supergirl?\u201d\nKara\u2019s eyes fly open, because that\u2019s not something she\u2019s been expecting. \u201cWhy do you need her at stupid o\u2019clock in the morning? She could be sleeping. I could also be sleeping.\u201d\nLena passes Kara the phone.\u00a0 Kara squints at it, willing the letters to come together into something that makes sense. The message is short, from an account with no followers and no posts. Kara has no idea how they even managed to message Lena. \u201cAren\u2019t your\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, my privacy settings are like Fort Knox. I\u2019m not stupid. This \u2013 this is something that Supergirl is going to want to know about with the protests in town.\u201d\n\u201cI can see that.\u201d Kara mumbles, turning back to the message.\u00a0 \u201cYour disloyalty to the cause will come with a heavy price \u2013 dramatic, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nLena purses her lips, looks down at her hands.\u00a0 \u201cCan you call her?\u201d\nKara shakes her head, hating the lie, hating that it\u2019s so transparent. \u201cI can\u2019t call her, but I can call my sister. She\u2019s probably better connected to help you out. Is that okay?\u201d Lena\u2019s head dips once. Kara leans over the side of the bed.\u00a0 She pulls her phone out and punches in Alex\u2019s number. \u201cHey \u2013 it\u2019s me,\u201d she says when Alex answers.\n\u201cDo I need to go buy Plan B?\u201d Alex\u2019s tone is teasing. Kara\u2019s cheeks burn.\n\u201cNot how it works,\u201d Kara points out.\n\u201cYou just left Kara, where the hell are you?\n\u201cI\u2019m with Lena.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re where?\u201d\n\u201cI was wondering if you could get some guys from work and come over,\u201d Kara says, hoping \u2013 praying that Alex follows. \u201cLena\u2019s just gotten a creepy message on her Instagram, and she\u2019s freaking out. It\u2026 apparently isn\u2019t the first.\u201d\n\u201cI can do that. Dark glasses and combat gear works wonders on anxious women with nothing to worry about.\u201d Alex is the actual best; Kara exhales, thanks her and hangs up.\n\u201cShe\u2019s coming over\u2026\u201d Kara trails off, glancing at Lena. \u201cIs this the first time it\u2019s happened?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lena says, just a bit too forcefully. Her shoulders are shaking, trembling. \u201cUsually I can figure out where they came from. Usually I know before they come.\u201d\nKara takes Lena\u2019s phone from her and sets it and her own on the bed side table.\u00a0 She pulls Lena close and holds her. \u201cWho sends you these messages, usually?\u201d\n\u201cLex,\u201d Lena says. \u201cWho else?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLena takes a few minutes of lying in Kara\u2019s arms to pull herself together before she disappears into the shower. Kara gets up and attempts to figure out Lena\u2019s coffee situation before she gives up and retreats into her twitter feed. Kara fidgets with her phone, debates calling in sick, and nearly jumps out of her skin phone when it rings. Snapper\u2019s on the line, tells her that she doesn\u2019t need to come into the office today because she\u2019s been put on the protests with a more senior reporter because his usual print counterpart is out with the flu. She\u2019s to meet Jefferson Kingston at a coffee shop on 5th in an hour and they\u2019ll plan their attack there.\u00a0 \u201cAnd Danvers?\u201d Snapper says as Kara makes to hang up.\u00a0 \u201cMake sure to bring an extra battery for your phone. This could be a long night.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir, of course sir.\u201d\nKara sits at Lena\u2019s kitchen island and drags a hand through her hair.\u00a0 Her phone is half dead as it is. She checks her twitter feed again, eyeing the protest hashtag that\u2019s already exploding.\u00a0 This is day six. She would have assumed it\u2019d\u2019ve died down by now. And damn, her phone is going to die if she doesn\u2019t do something about it. She gets to her feet and goes to knock on the bathroom door. She waits a second before cracking the door open. \u201cHey Lena?\u201d\n\u201cMn?\u201d Lena sticks her head, dripping wet and with a toothbrush hanging out of her mouth.\nThe flush that colors Kara\u2019s cheeks is so hot it burns. Lena pulls her toothbrush from her mouth and flashes Kara an encouraging grin.\u00a0 Kara remembers what she\u2019s barged in to ask, and holds up her mostly dead phone. \u201cDo you have an iPhone charger?\u201d\n\u201cCheck my laptop bag.\u201d Lena says, and retreats.\nLena\u2019s laptop bag is by the door, and Kara\u2019s just found the cord in the tangled mess of wires Lena keeps in the front pocket of the bag when there\u2019s a knock on the door.\u00a0 Alex is there, with two DEO agents that Kara recognizes in passing but doesn\u2019t know well enough to be on a first name basis with them as Kara Danvers.\u00a0 Kara opens the door, cord still in hand.\u00a0 \u201cHey \u2013 Lena\u2019s in the shower, come in.\u201d\nAlex gives her a once-over. \u201cYou look like crap. Did you sleep in your clothes?\u201d\n\u201cI took my pants off.\u201d Kara scowls. \u201cLike a normal person.\u201d\nAlex\u2019s grin turns a little wicked. \u201cThat it?\u201d\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d Kara throws up her hands. \u201cNot right now, Alex.\u201d She shoos Alex and her DEO agents, Marcus and \u2026 maybe Jamie (she can\u2019t remember) into the apartment before going to plug her phone in. She tells Alex about the message and how Lena\u2019s pretty shaken up \u2013 she doesn\u2019t show it to Alex because there\u2019s a passcode on Lena\u2019s phone and while Kara\u2019s pretty sure she knows what it is through simple elimination and mathematical probability, she\u2019s not about to violate Lena\u2019s privacy like that.\u00a0 So instead she tells Alex that she\u2019s been assigned to cover the protests, so she\u2019s glad Alex is there, because she\u2019s going to have to run home and get ready and she doesn\u2019t want Lena to be alone.\nThe shower\u2019s off, and Lena appears a few minutes later, hair still damp and frizzing in the early morning light as it starts to dry.\u00a0 She\u2019s dressed for work, a dark colored dress that offsets the casual nature of this encounter. Kara\u2019s impressed by how calm she is, how unfazed she seems after the conversation they shared earlier. \u201cAgent Danvers,\u201d she says. \u201cGood morning.\u201d\n\u201cMs. Luthor.\u201d Alex says, and the entire tenor of the room shifts from casual to business like. \u201cKara was telling me that this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve received a message like this.\u201d\nLena nods. \u201cThe messages aren\u2019t a new development. My brother \u2013 well, his surrogates \u2013 have a knack of hacking through my encryption. He thinks it keeps me on my toes, much like the assassination attempts.\u201d There\u2019s a moment then, when Kara looks up from tying her shoes, when Lena looks so small and so worried, that makes Kara\u2019s heart break a little inside. All she wants to do is stay and make sure that Lena\u2019s going to be okay \u2013 but she can\u2019t. Snapper wants her and Jefferson Kingston is probably waiting for her at the coffee shop already.\u00a0 \u201cThough,\u201d Lena continues, \u201cI have to say I do prefer the threatening messages over the near-death experiences.\u201d\nAlex lets out a little grunt of laughter. \u201cCan you show me the message?\u00a0 I want Agent Rameriez to have a look at it.\u00a0 Jamie, get the laptop too.\u201d She turns to Rameriez \u2013 Jamie \u2013 and seems to have a silent conversation with her before her gaze wanders down to Kara. \u201cAre you headed out?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Kara gets to her feet. \u201cI have to cover the protests today with Jeff Kingston; Cassandra Mullen is out with the flu. I would stay a little longer, but I need to\u2026 you know, get my things.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d Lena looks so betrayed, so hopeless, that Kara\u2019s fingers flex with the urge to go to her phone and call Snapper back and tell him she\u2019s got the flu too.\u00a0 But she knows she\u2019ll be more useful at the protests, because if they\u2019re already active at just barely seven in the morning, she needs to be there \u2013 both as Kara and probably as Supergirl as well.\u00a0 There\u2019s no way that it isn\u2019t going to turn ugly tonight.\nA weak smile pulls at Kara\u2019s lips. \u201cI wish I could stay. I was debating calling in sick when Snapper called and this \u2013 well, this is a big deal and after the fight I had with James, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s smart for me to avoid the office on personal grounds.\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019d look like you\u2019re hiding.\u201d Lena moves closer, taking Kara\u2019s phone from where it\u2019s charging and passing it back to her.\u00a0 \u201cAgent Danvers, do you mind waiting a moment while I speak to Kara outside?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s advisable for you to leave the premises until we can ascertain the threat.\u201d Alex says from where she\u2019s reading Rameriez\u2019s laptop screen.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be careful,\u201d Lena promises, \u201cIt\u2019s just the hallway.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d \nKara fidgets when they\u2019re outside and alone. She adjusts her glasses and checks the time on her phone. She\u2019 got forty-five minutes now, and a shower seems like a distant possibility.\u00a0 \u201cThis um \u2013 this isn\u2019t how I envisioned this morning going.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d\u00a0 Lena steps into Kara\u2019s personal space, her fingers running over Kara\u2019s shoulders. She hesitates, just for a moment, before rising up on her bare toes and pressing her lips to the corner of Kara\u2019s mouth.\u00a0 Kara turns her head to catch Lena\u2019s lips, her fingers resting on Lena\u2019s hips and drawing her in closer. This kiss tastes like a promise, and Lena\u2019s warm and slightly damp and a little freaked out. This is moving fast, too fast for Kara. Lena\u2019s pushing her backwards, back against the wall of the hallway outside of her apartment door. Her tongue is in Kara\u2019s mouth and her fingers are splayed across Kara\u2019s stomach and pushing up to the underside of her bra. Kara lets Lena take the lead, lets herself be kissed to the point where her brain short circuits and Lena\u2019s drawing back, lips kiss-swollen and her eyes hooded.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen this is done,\u201d Lena says, taking her hands away. Kara feels cold, misses Lena\u2019s touch. \u201cWhen whatever this crazy Instagram follower is caught. You and I are going to do this again.\u201d She sucks her lower lip into her mouth and looks hopefully up at Kara.\nKara nods, her fingers brushing some frizzing, drying hair from Lena\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou should go back inside and let Alex help you. I need to go possibly get sprayed by NCPD teargas.\u201d\n\u201cGod, I hope not.\u201d\n\u201cWith this sort of a thing, and the way that reporters are treated by the police when covering a protest? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\u201d Kara says. \u201cI\u2019ll bring some milk with me.\u201d Lena looks worried. Kara smiles at her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d\nKara presses a kiss to Lena\u2019s lips. \u201cI worry about you too, so we\u2019re even.\u201d And Lena lets her go, lets her get in the elevator, and doesn\u2019t wave when the doors close.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJeff Kingston is older, with gray around his temples and an imposing figure offset by his friendly smile that instantly puts Kara at ease.\u00a0 He\u2019s the eleven o\u2019clock anchor usually, but since the protests have started, he\u2019s been reporting from the heart of the protests while the six o\u2019clock guy pulls double duty as anchor. Kara\u2019s known him for two years now; Cat actually liked him, which couldn\u2019t be said for most of the reporters CatCo employed.\u00a0 \u201cI hear you\u2019re here to cover the print side of things. Since Cass is out.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have a face for TV,\u201d Kara answers, shifting her backpack straps forward under her thumbs. \u201cI\u2019m just grateful for the opportunity.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to use the McDonalds up the street as a base of operations, they have free wifi and the folks there are willing to let us use it provided we aren\u2019t obtrusive to their customers.\u201d Jeff slings his bag over his shoulder. \u201cThis is Hieu, he\u2019s camera 1 today.\u00a0 Hieu, this is Kara Danvers. She\u2019s our Cass for today.\u201d \u00a0Kara shakes the guy\u2019s hand and he smiles tiredly at her.\u00a0 \u201cDo you have the passwords for the CatCo Twitter feed?\u201d\n\u201cI was going to use my personal feed,\u201d Kara answers. \u201cAnd I created the CatCo Facebook live account, so I\u2019ve got that and Periscope on the official Twitter if we need it.\u201d That\u2019s how Cassandra was handling it, and Kara thinks the consistency would be good.\nJeff nods. \u201cAlright. How about a battery pack?\u201d\n\u201cGot two.\u201d Well, technically she has one but its DEO standard issue, so it\u2019s a lot more powerful than the standard Wal-Mart portable charger fare.\n\u201cSounds like you\u2019re as prepared as you can be. I warn you, some of the stuff being said here is nasty\u2026 I know that Snapper was concerned that you were too sympathetic to be impartial.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, sir.\u201d\nHieu flashes Kara another week smile, slings his camera over his shoulder, and nods to Jeff.\n\nOnce more, into the break.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n@KaraD4nvers \u2013 Protests now moving toward midtown. Crown calm, lots of discussion and chanting. #nationalcityprotest #ncprotest #catcolive\n@KaraD4nvers \u2013 Counter protest slowly gathering steam. Conversation shifting to sustainable extraterrestrial resettlement practices. #nationalcityprotest #ncprotest #catcolive\n@KaraD4nvers - .@jeffKingst0n speaking to anti-alien resettlement activist and US Congressman, @TomUnitas. bit.ly/5ujk34 #ncprotest #catcolive\n@KaraD4nvers \u2013 NCPD is on the scene and has set up barricades to keep the two sides from clashing. #nationalcityprotest #ncprotest #catcolive | @LenaLuthor_ - @KaraD4nvers are you behind a press barricade? | @KaraD4nvers - @LenaLuthor_ They haven\u2019t set one up as of yet. Currently speaking with anti-resettlement folks. | @beccajkf89 - @KaraD4nvers @LenaLuthor_ Get a room. | @jaji123 - @KaraD4nvers @LenaLuthor_ MOMS | @raddd_af - @KaraD4nvers @LenaLuthor_ Hypocrites. Your bleeding hearts for alien scum have no place at such a righteous event. #ETGOHOME | @LenaLuthor_ - @KaraD4nvers \u2013 Be careful out there, okay? | @jaquilter - @beccajkf89 IS THIS CONFIRMATION?!?! @LenaLuthor_ @KaraD4nvers | @beccajkf89 - @jaquilter ummmmmmmmm idek but I AM SHOOK.\n\u00a0\nNational City PD does end up shuffling them behind a makeshift police barrier, and Kara checks her twitter mentions to see that it\u2019s Lena\u2019s crazy followers, rather than anti-alien trolls, who are blowing her up.\u00a0 She sighs. Lena shouldn\u2019t have done that, shouldn\u2019t have brought their relationship into the forefront of her social media like that. That sort of polite concern, should it catch Snapper\u2019s attention, might lead to Kara getting into trouble.\u00a0\nJeff glanced over at her. \u201cHow ya holding up?\u201d\nKara shrugged. \u201cAlright. I don\u2019t like the really xenophobic mentions in my twitter mentions, but I\u2019ll cope.\u201d\nHer phone dings.\u00a0 The protest is at a strange lull. It\u2019s lunch time, and Kara\u2019s stomach is growling. Alex has sent along a message.\n\nAlex: \nLL gone to work, still a bit shaken. Sent Jamie with her to keep an eye on things there. Tracked the message back to the girl from Wed. night. Winn trying to locate now. May be at protest.\n\n\nKara: \nDo you want me to look for the stalker?\n\n\nAlex: \nThat depends on what you want LL to know.\n\nFrowning, Kara types back a quick message.\n\nKara: \nWhat do you mean?\n\n\nAlex: \u00a0\nShe isn\u2019t stupid. You told her half the story, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s put it together with Wednesday night. If you find the girl \u2013 you\u2019ll be telling her you know about her stalker, when you have no way of knowing.\n\n\nKara: \nSo what should I do?\n\n\nAlex: \nThat\u2019s entirely up to you.\n\nShe\u2019s stuck, stuck until these protests dissipate at this rate.\u00a0 Kara jams her phone into her back pocket and moves to stand near Jeff.\u00a0 \u201cAre these barricades normal?\u201d\n\u201cOnly when they\u2019re worried,\u201d Jeff answers.\u00a0\nHieu nods his agreement. \u201cAfter this past weekend, with Supergirl coming to the pro-alien side, the cops are jittery.\u201d\n\u201cHas anyone spoken to them about their preparedness?\u201d Kara asks. It seems the sort of angle that Snapper would be interested in getting up on the website as soon as possible, especially with the confusion over why the police presence is so strong after nearly a week of peaceful protests after the weekend\u2019s violence.\nJeff rubs his growing beard.\u00a0 \u201cI think Cass had started on something, but you\u2019d have to confirm with Snapper if it ever got up onto the website.\u201d\nKara nods, and pulls her phone back out of her pocket, calling Snapper and getting his assessment of the situation.\u00a0 He agrees with her that the story should go up as soon as possible, but that he had no idea if Cass was writing anything. She hadn\u2019t mentioned to him, if she was.\u00a0 \u201cGood instincts, Danvers,\u201d Snapper says when he hangs up.\u00a0 Kara feels like she\u2019s fit to burst with pride. She tells Jeff what she\u2019s doing, and then slips out of the back of the press corral.\nShe moves between the two sides, speaking to the uniformed SWAT officers and the sergeant in charge of holding down the barricade.\u00a0 The SWAT guys are disinclined to speak to her, but she\u2019s got a pretty smile and can be exceptionally sincere when she wants to be.\u00a0 The sergeant gives her more information, before directing her to the NCPD press liaison.\u00a0 Kara retreats to the McDonalds to call her and to write.\u00a0\nKara gets fries after dashing off a quick 500 words and confirming with the press liaison that her facts are correct, and sits charging her phone for a few minutes when she looks up to see a girl with close cropped ashy hair and a thick army surplus jacket slipping off her shoulders.\u00a0 Kara does a double take. And when the girl turns to stare at Kara, it\u2019s like she looks straight through Kara\u2019s work clothes to see her alien core.\u00a0 Her lips curl in a hateful expression, but she says nothing, takes her coffee when it comes up, and ambles closer.\nFingers shaking, Kara reaches for her phone, texts Alex from her lap.\n\nKara: \nShe\u2019s here. Trace my phone.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re the newest member of our elite club,\u201d The girl plops down opposite Kara. She sprawls in the chair, kicking out Doc Marten clad feet and drumming her fingers on the table.\u00a0 Her coffee is all sugar, and Kara can smell the hint of alien on her.\u00a0 She isn\u2019t human, not fully at any rate. Passing though. Kara wonders where she\u2019s from \u2013 what she has against Kryptonians.\nIt\u2019s almost a compulsion at this point, but Kara reaches up and fiddles with her glasses. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re Lena Luthor\u2019s newest conquest.\u201d The girl flashes a toothy smile that is more predatory than friendly.\u00a0 \u201cWonder what she\u2019ll do when she finds out that you\u2019d sell her cause out for a handful of clicks.\u201d\nThere are several ways to play this. Kara eats a fry, watches this girl warily for a moment before she exhales and lets the girl who has spent two years idolizing Cat Grant come to the surface.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t you read your own Instagram feed? Lena Luthor picked her side, like a week ago. Or have you not been paying attention.\u201d\nThe girl\u2019s lip curls. \u201cShe threw her lot in with that ja\u2019klen. Her loss. She\u2019s a traitor to the cause. She\u2019ll pay.\u201d She gets to her feet and takes her coffee with her. Kara tries to place the world.\u00a0 She\u2019s heard it before, but not for a long time.\u00a0 She thinks it means something like traitor, but she can\u2019t place the planet or country of origin. \u201cBut she is a Luthor and that name means something. She\u2019s a fool if she thinks she can bury that tech behind a late-developing conscious.\u201d\n\u201cThe alien detector?\u201d Kara asks, her tone deliberately mild.\u00a0 Her phone has buzzed four times in short succession.\u00a0 Alex is on her way. \u201cWhen she showed me how it worked, I passed the test.\u201d\u00a0 She looks up through her lashes at the girl, daring her to act, daring her to fight back.\u00a0 \u201cWould you?\u201d\nThe girl opens her mouth, tongue \u2013 her forked tongue \u2013 running over her lower lip. The biting curse word at her lips cuts Kara to the core. It\u2019s the same as the comments on Lena\u2019s Instagram feed, as Kara\u2019s twitter mentions. It has Kara\u2019s lips moving, without thinking, retorting in Kryptonese before she can even think about it too hard. The words are viscous, cutting, and definitely not beautiful like the words she spoke to Lena. They\u2019re meant to hurt, all guttural stops and cutting across Kara\u2019s tongue in a way that feels so, so good. She misses this language. She misses speaking it.\nEven if she should not be speaking it now.\n\u201cNow who\u2019s lying?\u201d The girl says.\nKara hesitates. \u201cI think we both are.\u201d\n\u201cAre you one of the good ones?\u201d\n\u201cAre you?\u201d\nThe girl sighs, fiddles with her coffee. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you come from, but you\u2019re deluding yourself if you think that there\u2019s such thing as a good alien.\u00a0 We\u2019re invaders, we come here expecting to blend, but we don\u2019t. We speak different languages, we don\u2019t believe in the same things the people here do. We have different values. We\u2019re socialized differently.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can justify that much self-loathing,\u201d Kara says quietly. \u201cThere are good aliens. Look at Supergirl.\u201d\n\u201cShe saved the city from a problem of her own making. By rights she should have never been here in the first place. Her planet is gone and she should be too.\u201d The girl checks her watch, and gets to her feet.\u00a0 \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2014\u201d Kara gets hurriedly to her feet.\u00a0 \u201cWhy are you trying to incite these people into violence that could be directed at you?\u201d\n\u201cWhere did Lena find you, Christ you\u2019re naive.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSave it, girlscout. If you can\u2019t figure it out, I\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d She turns and leaves, Kara watching her with a baffled expression on her face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlex arrives right at the time Snapper calls Kara after having read her copy with a few clarifying questions.\u00a0 Kara tells him she just spoke to an alien who was against the president\u2019s law while Alex fans out her plain clothes DEO operatives to try and find out where she went.\u00a0\n\u201cDid you get any good quotes?\u201d he demands.\n\u201cMore like threats,\u201d Kara says. \u201cI think we need to make sure that we follow any movement by this protest.\u201d\n\u201cSo charge your phone.\u201d Snapper says, and hangs up.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s nine-thirty when a hand closes on Kara\u2019s shoulder. A lot of people have gone home now, and the feel of everything has turned intense, charged with an energy fueled by resentment and compassion.\u00a0 Kara\u2019s still documenting it, but she\u2019s exhausted at this point, the bags under Hieu and Jeff\u2019s eyes are equally bad.\u00a0 So when the hand closed around her shoulder, Kara just about jumps out of her skin. She turns and it\u2019s only Lena, with Alex a few steps behind her.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Kara asks.\nLena holds up a bag of something that smells goddamn delicious and Kara\u2019s stomach lurches uncomfortably.\u00a0 Alex has a fond smile on her face.\u00a0 \u201cI figured you probably hadn\u2019t eaten yet?\u201d\nJeff and Hieu are looking at Kara as though she\u2019s a crazy person, so Kara steps back.\u00a0 \u201cGuys, this is Lena, and my sister Alex; Alex, Lena, this is Jeff and Hieu. They\u2019re on the broadcast side of things.\u201d She\u2019s minimizing the importance and social clout of everyone in the conversation.\nIt\u2019s Hieu who recovers first. \u201cMs. Luthor. I didn\u2019t expect you to venture out of your tower to mingle\u2026 it probably isn\u2019t safe.\u201d\nLena shrugs. \u201cNeither are starving reporters. If you\u2019re not fed, you might report fake news.\u201d\n\u201cPretty sure that\u2019s written into the job description,\u201d Jeff answers.\u00a0 He holds out a hand.\u00a0 \u201cJeff Kingston.\u201d\n\u201cLena Luthor,\u201d Lena answers. \u201cYou\u2019re the eleven o\u2019clock anchor, yes?\u201d\n\u201cYou caught me.\u201d Jeff smiles. Lena grins up at him.\u00a0 \u201cAny chance there\u2019s enough to share in there?\u201d\nKara looks at the food, she mourns the food that could have all been her\u2019s, but Alex has an eyebrow cocked and Lena\u2019s laughing behind her hand. \u201cThere should be enough. Agent Danvers \u2013 Alex \u2013 she suggested we get enough to feed a small army.\u201d\n\u201cOr at least the CatCo contingent,\u201d Alex says. She tilts her head to one side, and Kara follows her out of ear shot of Jeff and Hieu.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening \u2013 Lena shouldn\u2019t be down here. That girl \u2013 I don\u2019t know where she\u2019s from, but she\u2019s definitely got a grudge.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a plan,\u201d Alex explains. \u201cThis is part of it. I\u2019ll keep her safe, I promise.\u201d\nKara bites her lip, and Alex just looks so self-assured that Kara can\u2019t help but feel a little better.\nSo maybe Kara lets Lena snap a picture of the two of them with Jeff and Hieu, eating Chinese takeout from a far nicer restaurant than any of them can afford with the lights of the NCPD cars in the background. Kara\u2019s got chopsticks halfway to her mouth, and Lena\u2019s reclined back against her. Hieu looks tired and Jeff is grinning like a fool.\n@LenaLuthor_ Dropped off dinner for some friends tonight, they\u2019re doing good work, keeping National City in the loop about what\u2019s going on in Midtown. pic.twitter.com/DJ292ujqy7\nAnd maybe she lets Lena pull her into an alleyway for an openmouthed kiss, her back pushing against the filthy wall and wanting Lena to touch her everywhere and knowing that they cannot \u2013 not yet.\n\n Saturday \u2013  \n\nIt\u2019s after midnight when the protests get bad. Kara\u2019s phone is at 20% battery and both sides are pushing against the NCPD barricades set up to keep them separate and safe. Kara\u2019s jittery, her fingers shaking as she tweets, staying half a step behind Hieu and his camera. Jeff\u2019s pushing through the throng of the anti-alien protest, speaking to anyone will listen to him.\u00a0 Kara\u2019s dismayed to see two California congressmen, as well as a few state assembly members and local government officials in the crowd. She makes sure that the #CatCoLive hashtag identifies all of them.\nPeople are bumping against her, pressing in on her at all sides. Kara backs out slowly, careful not to touch anyone. She\u2019s not used to crowds like this, not used to being surrounded by people and knowing that all she has to do is move wrong and she\u2019ll send someone flying.\u00a0 There was a reason she never went to a concert again after that MCR one Alex dragged her to in high school, it was too claustrophobic, too intolerable.\nWhen she breaks free, she calls Alex.\u00a0 Fidgets until Alex picks up. \u201cThis is a situation for her but I can\u2019t get away,\u201d she says.\u00a0 She\u2019s not going to say Supergirl in a place so crowded.\u00a0\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want her to show up,\u201d Alex answers.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019d fuck up the plan.\u201d\n\u201cWho are we?\u201d\n\u201cYour girlfriend and I.\u201d Alex\u2019s grin is evident in her voice.\nThe force of the flush that covers Kara\u2019s cheeks then, in the middle of all this hatred and combativeness.\u00a0 She swallows down the urge to correct Alex \u2013 because she and Lena haven\u2019t had that conversation yet.\u00a0 She wants it to be the case, but she doesn\u2019t \u2013 not without being completely honest with her. Kara\u2019s still afraid of that. She\u2019s not even completely honest with Alex most of the time. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve got no battery left, Alex. What\u2019s the plan?\u201d\n\u201cWell, we know that the girl you talked to isn\u2019t alone. She\u2019s got at least a few other people she\u2019s working with to incite the violence.\u00a0 I \u2013 we \u2013 think it\u2019s better if Supergirl doesn\u2019t appear, but rather that they\u2019re caught on camera as aliens trying to get humans to riot. Lena thinks you could write a really good think piece about it.\u201d\nKara bites her lip, glancing toward the sky. She doesn\u2019t like this. Doesn\u2019t like the idea of the violence taking place at all, or the idea that they\u2019re deliberately trying to bait it into happening again.\u00a0 Plus, if she were to broadcast it live, it would look really bad for the alien community of National City, and Kara\u2019s pretty sure she\u2019s got an ethical obligation as a member of both the press and as an extraterrestrial who has considered registering to present this in a way that isn\u2019t going to incite violence against her community.\nBut then it hits her, the implication behind Alex\u2019s comment.\u00a0 Lena\u2019s figured it out. And Alex has confirmed it to her.\u00a0 Kara swallows, fidgets. \u201cThen she knows.\u201d\nThere are sirens now. The NCPD is trying to keep people separate and it isn\u2019t going great.\n\u201cChrist, Kara she figured it out ages ago.\u201d Alex sighs. \u201cI took care of that NDA as well, while we were at her place.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t answer her, when she asked.\u201d Kara says.\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need you to, if you don\u2019t want to.\u00a0 Wasn\u2019t that how Clark and Lois were for ages?\u201d Alex shakes her head. \u201cI never confirmed it at any rate, just operated on her assumption that Supergirl wouldn\u2019t be available. Anyway, we\u2019ve got their home addresses too and are waiting for their return to black bag \u2018em and figure out why they\u2019re so angry, but Lena\u2019s convinced that if you can use your social media presence to sway public opinion.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to get her on CatCo Live.\u201d Kara puts it together.\n\u201cWith Jeff, if you can.\u201d\nKara bites her lip, looks down at her feet and scuffs the pavement with her note.\u00a0 A piece of asphalt splinters off and ricochets into the side of a building, shattering on impact and leaving a dent.\u00a0 Kara sighs. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cAlex, think about it. You want me to out her.\u201d Kara puffs out her cheeks. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to set that precedent.\u201d\nAlex is silent for a moment.\u00a0 Behind Kara, the sirens mix with a bullhorn chant of \u201cET GO HOME.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s awful, making Kara want to curl into herself and stick her fingers in her ears. How can people be so hateful? How can aliens participate in this hateful rhetoric?\nAn explosion rocks her sideways.\u00a0 The line goes dead.\u00a0 Kara looks up to see the alien girl from earlier standing in the middle of a circle of fallen people, her hands clutching a decide that doesn\u2019t look earth-made, save for the LuthorCorp branding on the side.\u00a0 She\u2019s grinning, wide and wicked, and her eyes meet Kara\u2019s across the chaotic scene.\u00a0 Kara makes a decision then, amid the chaos, with Hieu and Jeff somewhere under a crush of fallen people.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n@KaraD4nvers is currently broadcasting on Periscope! #nationalcityprotest #ncprotest #catcolive\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s never gone to journalism school, or even followed the news all that closely.\u00a0 She\u2019s watched Lois broadcast from warzones all her life.\u00a0 Kara speaks clearly and concisely, explaining what\u2019s happening as she helps people to their feet.\u00a0 Alex tries to call her back, she ignores the call until Alex patches in on the DEO radio and demands to know what the hell happened.\n\u201cExplosion,\u201d Kara says. \u201cSome sort of sonic boom.\u00a0 Knocked a lot of people in the area down; people close to the epicenter are hurt.\u201d She puts her finger over her phone\u2019s speaker and adds, just to Alex, \u201cIt\u2019s LuthorCorp branded.\u201d\n\u201cL-Corp?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kara says. \u201cLuthorCrop. The old logo.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have Lena look at it.\u201d Alex says quickly, but Kara\u2019s pretty sure they don\u2019t need to. The LuthorCorp tech is there to make sure that this is somehow connected back to the nation\u2019s most staunch anti-alien activist.\u00a0 And it\u2019s in the hands of an alien herself.\u00a0 \u201cShe\u2019s worried about you, you know.\u201d\nRao, Kara thinks. What a mess. She can\u2019t stomach the idea of Lena worrying about her, or the idea that Lena wanted her out this girl as an alien on what would be national TV.\u00a0 Lena\u2019s smart, too smart sometimes, but that outing \u2013 that\u2019s the same sort of behavior as her alien detection device.\u00a0 Another fuck up; another red flag.\u00a0 She\u2019s been raised in an environment so hateful toward aliens that these will come.\nKara swallows, hating that she\u2019s making excuses for Lena and her attitudes.\u00a0 She wonders if this can even work between them. This girl has also threatened Lena. Threatened her and made her feel so frightened that Kara\u2019s hooked her up with Alex to keep an eye on her. So she asks, rather than asking why Lena cares, if Kara\u2019s an alien and no better than these other aliens.\u00a0 \u201cIs she safe?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d Alex says. \u201cLiterally crawling up my ass to make sure that you\u2019re okay. Are you okay, Kara?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Kara says. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d\n\u201cWe have to get through the traffic first.\u00a0 The roads are clogged with EMS.\u201d\u00a0 Alex falters.\u00a0 \u201cKara\u2026 are you sure you\u2019re okay? \u00a0Fly out of there if you\u2019re worried. Come back as her.\u201d\nBut Kara\u2019s ignoring her.\u00a0 Jeff and Hieu are getting to their feet. The camera\u2019s lens is smashed. They can\u2019t broadcast.\u00a0 Heiu thinks he has another in the truck and starts picking his way through the crowd of stunned people to see if he can find it.\u00a0 Jeff gets in front of Kara\u2019s feed and starts his broadcast.\u00a0 Kara\u2019s gotten the camera steady now, and she holds it while Jeff tells what\u2019s happened.\u00a0 And then, in the middle of all of it, the girl with the forked tongue walks over to them.\u00a0 She\u2019s grinning, blood splattered down her cheek.\u00a0\n\u201cNow people know,\u201d she says. \u201cAliens are dangerous. They don\u2019t belong on earth.\u201d\nJeff\u2019s eyes go wide, Kara tilts her phone.\u00a0 They stare at her for a moment, before Jeff goes into reporter mode and asks if she\u2019d like to comment further. Kara holds the camera steady and feels the chill settle over her bones.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t how this should be, how this should go. Aliens should want to be accepted, not be treated as others.\u00a0 This girl is passing, she could have a job here, work here; but nothing is stopping the vile words spewing from her mouth. It isn\u2019t like she\u2019s unable to blend in.\n\u201cThe president\u2019s law is dangerous, the corporations of National City taking a stance on aliens in our midst is dangerous.\u00a0 Alien technology created that device, it was used by Lex Luthor to attempt to murder Superman, and with it all of Metropolis.\u00a0 Why should we accept that just because we are not dangerous that others won\u2019t be?\u00a0 Our technology is years ahead of Earth\u2019s, our people are smarter, better evolved, and yet we\u2019re stuck here. We need to go home if we can, assimilate if we can\u2019t.\u201d\nHieu appears beside Kara, turning the new camera on and starting to document the scene.\u00a0 Kara\u2019s phone starts to blink a low battery warning, before it goes blank.\n\u00a0\nKara doesn\u2019t go home.\u00a0 She goes to CatCo and sits in Snapper\u2019s office and explains the article she wants to write, the article that asks the questions that have been swirling in her mind since the girl with her forked tongue and anti-alien rhetoric stepped in front of her at the McDonalds. He asks questions, tells her that she can\u2019t do it, and then lets her argue with him until she\u2019s convinced him.\u00a0 She has to be the one to tell this story.\u00a0\nHe gives her his blessing and Kara writes it, sends it to Snapper, and does his edits.\u00a0 It\u2019s eight-thirty in the morning by then, and Kara\u2019s running on coffee and adrenaline. She posts it to the website and stumbles out of the office, making sure to retweet the article to her personal account before sleepily calling an uber and telling the driver Lena\u2019s address. She wants a shower and bed.\u00a0 She\u2019s covered in Lex Luthor brand EMP dust, it\u2019s in her hair and her lungs and she\u2019s exhausted.\nLena answers when Kara knocks, sliding back the bolt on the door.\u00a0 \u201cAre you alright?\u201d she asks.\u00a0 Her laptop is open on the kitchen island.\u00a0 The CatCo website is pulled up, and the byline on the article says Kara wrote it.\u00a0 Snapper\u2019s headline \u2013 The Anti-Alien Alien \u2013 isn\u2019t great, but it\u2019ll get the clicks that they want to drive ad revenue. \u201cYou wrote that.\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\u201cDo you believe in it?\u201d\n\u201cNot all of it, but enough to feel like it was necessary.\u201d Kara answers.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve single-handedly set the alien rights cause back fifteen years, easily.\u201d\nLena closes the door behind Kara and hesitates, just for a moment, before speaking:\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re right to question how someone who is a member of a community can hate themselves so much.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it!\u201d Kara blurts out. \u201cHow can she be like this? How can any alien who\u2019s got a chance at a good, happy, peaceful life here on earth be so hateful about others who want that same choice?\u00a0 We\u2019re not violent, not all of us.\u00a0 We should be allowed to be here and be peaceful.\u201d\nLena says nothing.\n\u201cBut she\u2019s your follower, isn\u2019t she? That\u2019s why you followed her, because she was a self-loathing alien who wanted to use your brother\u2019s technology to prove her point that aliens don\u2019t belong in National City. You looked through her feed and saw someone who was a risk to your business. You looked at her and didn\u2019t see someone who needed help, but rather a PR nightmare.\u201d\u00a0 Kara pulls off her shoes, and then her dirty jacket and shirt.\u00a0 When she\u2019s in her tank top and her filthy jeans, she looks up at Lena, still silent. \u201cAlex told me that you wanted me to out her.\u201d\nLena bites her lip. \u201cI did.\u201d\nKara feels boneless.\u00a0 She rubs at the back of her head, her eyes sting with barely repressed tears of anger and relief.\u00a0 They\u2019re talking about this. It\u2019s good.\u00a0 \u201cDo you know why I couldn\u2019t do it?\u201d\nLena\u2019s head dips in acknowledgement.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to be put in that position, Kara. It just seemed like the most logical solution to a larger problem. She\u2019s outed, the protests realize they\u2019ve got a PR nightmare, I\u2019m saved a PR nightmare. Everyone wins.\u201d Lena shrugs. \u201cBesides, your sister and her black ops friends have her now.\u00a0 Does it matter if I may have considered a more extreme solution?\u201d\nSwallowing. Kara bends to remove her socks, one hand on the counter.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re not all like that.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0 Lena closes her laptop, closes the article that is probably going to end Kara\u2019s career before it even begins.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re mad.\u201d\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Lena steps forward, she takes Kara in her arms and holds her as tightly as she can. Her cheek rests on Kara\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0 Kara doesn\u2019t hug her back, not at first.\u00a0 She has to convince herself to relax, to allow this embrace when she\u2019s a mess of jittery nerves and fear.\u00a0 \u201cIf we continue on this path together, I\u2019m going to mess up. I\u2019m going to fall into old habits and attitudes. I\u2019m trying to be better Kara. I\u2019m trying to unlearn everything I ever was taught as a child. I want you to tell me when I fuck up, okay?\u201d\nKara\u2019s hands close around Lena\u2019s back. She\u2019s warm, steady, soft in her sleep clothes, and looking as tired as Kara feels.\u00a0 \u201cDo you think, had your follower\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHer name is Emily Martin.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\u00a0 Kara shakes her head. \u201cThat\u2019s so\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014normal? I thought so too.\u201d Lena steps backwards.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going to make some coffee, do you want some?\u201d\nKara shakes head. \u201cI want a shower. And then to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cSo you came here?\u201d\u00a0 Lena\u2019s smile is small, private. She doesn\u2019t move toward the coffee maker.\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe I wanted you too.\u201d Kara looks down at her hands, at her filthy jeans and tries to ignore the fact that they\u2019re shaking.\u00a0 \u201cEven if I am mad. It was a good plan. I just didn\u2019t agree with it. And I wrote the piece anyway.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just aliens who were having their name dragged through the mud,\u201d Lena points out.\u00a0 \u201cEven if she made a point of calling out my brother, it\u2019s still my name on that tech. I built it.\u201d\nKara knows this. Knows that Lena\u2019s company identity is so wrapped up in the hot, miserable mess of Lex Luthor\u2019s legacy; she hates it. \u201cI think you surprised her, by signing on to #alienswelcome.\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what started this whole thing with her.\u201d Lena looks Kara over for a moment, careful consideration on her face.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll get you a towel.\u201d\n\u201cWill you um\u2026\u201d Kara fidgets. She doesn\u2019t know how to say that she wants Lena to stay with her while she catches a few hours of sleep, or that she came here because she doesn\u2019t want to be alone and Alex is working so her only other option is off the table.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ve been up all night too.\u201d\nLena\u2019s eyes are soft. \u201cIf you\u2019ll have me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s your bed.\u201d\nLaughing, Lena takes Kara\u2019s hand and draws her into the apartment.\n\u00a0\n@rider78 It seems that @KaraD4nvers is speaking out of both sides of her mouth on the #alienrights issue.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRT: @CatCo_Mag\u00a0 The Anti-Alien Alien, National City Protests, and the place of aliens in society. @KaraD4nvers reports.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with reporting the truth.\n|\n@jiltedrose @unicorntears Especially when they were first on the scene. To ignore that and the context is dumb af.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy mentions are a disaster.\u201d Kara mumbles into Lena\u2019s shoulder four hours later.\u00a0 The day has turned bright and sleep is illusive.\u00a0 Lena\u2019s warm and working on her tablet. Kara has absolutely zero desire to drag herself out of Lena\u2019s bed and face the music of the fall out of her article. \u201cThat article needed to be written, and I think it was best that I wrote it. But I didn\u2019t\u2014well, I didn\u2019t anticipate that they\u2019d freak out like this.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a reporter, Kara. You\u2019re just there to tell the truth, doubly so since you were there when it happened.\u00a0 This wasn\u2019t an opinion piece.\u201d Lena\u2019s fingers tangle in Kara\u2019s hair.\u00a0 \u201cIt was a hard thing for you to do, given how you felt. I think you were really brave to do it.\u201d\n\u201cThis one says I should stick to eating Ms. Grant\u2019s\u2014OHMIGOD SHE REPLIED TO IT.\u201d Kara lets out an embarrassed noise and buries her face in the pillows. When her cheeks cool, just a little bit, she continues: \u201cWhere do these people get that idea?\u201d\nLena raises an eyebrow, nudging Kara so they\u2019re look at each other. \u201cThat never happened?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Kara says.\u00a0 Her cheeks are bright red. \u201cIt, well, it maybe could have in another life\u2026but she was my boss! I could never have done it.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, when I moved here, my mother told me to watch out for Cat Grant and her hapless crush on Supergirl. She thought it would turn into a vendetta.\u201d Lena\u2019s finger nails scrape at the skin at the base of Kara\u2019s neck, scratching, gentle.\u00a0 Kara likes the sensation.\u00a0 She leans into it.\u00a0 \u201cBecause of the family name.\u201d\n\u201cI think Ms. Grant likes you,\u201d Kara says quietly. \u201cShe was worried, when I started talking to you, but I think she\u2019s come around.\u201d\n\u201cHow very\u2026 maternal of her.\u201d Lena says. There\u2019s a hint of a grin on her face, but she\u2019s turned her attention back to her work before Kara can comment on it further.\u00a0\nKara goes through her mentions and frowns at a few of them, mutes a few accounts that have said particularly nasty things, and replies to some of the more reasonable and constructive criticisms.\u00a0 She\u2019s grateful that Snapper\u2019s standing by her and what she had to say.\u00a0 She\u2019s hoping that Jeff\u2019s piece, which follows in a similar line of questioning, will be up for the 6 o\u2019clock news segment so she\u2019ll stop taking all the heat.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLena has to go into the office after they eat a lunch of yogurt (Lena) and pancakes with yogurt, half a package of bacon and three apples (Kara). Lena laughs about how much Kara eats, and Kara explains to her that her metabolism works about ten times as fast on earth as it did at home, near as she and Alex can figure.\u00a0 It\u2019s strange, to have a conversation about her alien nature without actually feeling like a science experiment.\u00a0 Lena doesn\u2019t really ask a lot of questions about how Kara\u2019s body and biology work, but rather asks her if she\u2019s eaten enough.\u00a0\nKara refuses her in the traditional way, almost without thinking about it, and Lena looks at her, puzzled, just for a moment, before shaking her head.\u00a0 \u201cI assume that\u2019s meant to be a polite refusal?\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Kara says. She\u2019s in a borrowed pair of jeans that are a bit long for Lena (she\u2019s been meaning to take them in to be hemmed) and t-shirt that feels nicer than anything she owns, it smells like Lena and her old-fashioned perfume. Kara likes it. \u201cI feel bad; I haven\u2019t fallen back into these patterns in years. Not since I got here.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should you feel bad?\u201d Lena zips up her laptop case. \u201cBe whoever you want to be around me. You\u2019re allowed to show who you are, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nKara shifts from foot to foot.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve spent a long time repressing it and pretending to be well, human. Earth\u2019s customs are a bit different about well, everything.\u201d\n\u201cDating especially, or so it seems\u201d Lena says. She slings her laptop case over her shoulder.\u00a0 \u201cAm I\u2026 stepping on toes if I ask if that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing?\u201d\nHer hand flies up to her glasses, fidgeting with them for lack of a better thing to do with her hands.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re a good match,\u201d Kara says. In her heart she knows Lena\u2019s different than just a good match. James was a good match, all of her previous entanglements have been good matches.\u00a0 Lena is just there, she allows Kara to relax enough to be herself.\u00a0 She fits easily into places in Kara\u2019s life that she didn\u2019t know she needed someone to slot into.\u00a0 \u201cBetter than anyone I\u2019ve had before.\u201d\n\u201cThen it isn\u2019t rushing to ask you to come back later.\u201d Lena\u2019s flushed. Her skin is blotchy with her blush and Kara wants to kiss every inch of that exposed skin and make the red come to the surface and stay.\u00a0\nShe puts her hands in the pockets of her borrowed jeans and slings her reusable grocery bag full of dirty clothes closer to her body to keep from reaching out, from grabbing Lena and pulling her back toward the bed and to a place where they don\u2019t need to go face the music of their lives.\n\u201cAre you asking?\u201d\n\u201cIf you want.\u201d Lena\u2019s flushed redder now. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do anything, I just want you here tonight.\u201d\nKara\u2019s blushing now too. \u201cMy houseplants will worry about me, spending three nights away.\u201d\n\u201cGo see them now then,\u201d Lena laughs.\u00a0 She steps forward and kisses Kara\u2019s cheek, rising on her toes. \u201cOr go see your sister and her black ops buddies \u2013 which is what you\u2019re actually going to do.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll come back.\u201d Kara says. \u201cI promise.\u201d\nLena kisses her on the lips this time, full of a promise and a smile. Her fingers tangle in Kara\u2019s hair and pull her down, biting at Kara\u2019s lower lip and licking gently into her mouth once, then twice, until the bag falls from Kara\u2019s shoulder and she\u2019s breathing heavily for want to stay right here until the end of time.\nShe pulls away because she has to.\u00a0 She fiddles with the hem of Lena\u2019s sweater.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll call you if I\u2019m going to be late.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Lena says.\n\u00a0\nThe DEO is quiet for a Saturday afternoon.\u00a0 Winn takes one look at Kara\u2019s jeans and wiggles his eyebrows. \u201cHad a sleep over, did you?\u201d\n\u201cMore like I never went to sleep,\u201d Kara says, moving to where the coffee maker is tucked into an alcove behind his desk.\u00a0 She gets a cup of coffee and smiles at J'onn when he appears, looking every bit as exhausted as she feels.\u00a0\n\u201cI trust you got some sleep, Supergirl?\u201d J'onn asks.\n\u201cI did,\u201d she answers.\u00a0 \u201cDid you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, we were running an interrogation.\u201d He shakes his head, crossing his arms and staring out into the middle distance. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to her,\u201d he adds, in a lower voice. Kara knows that voice, it\u2019s the voice of a man who\u2019s spent so long pretending to avoid the alien conversations that come with his job that when he does have to have them, they come off as a secret, almost fearful thing.\u00a0\nKara moves closer, it\u2019s what J'onn wants, because Winn is attempting to listen in. Kara doesn\u2019t think J'onn particularly cares if Winn is listening in, but rather is bothered by the overt nature of his eavesdropping.\n\u201cShe told me she\u2019s from Metropolis. Born there.\u201d\n\u201cBut she\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot from here, yes. We ascertained that her parents emigrated when her mother was still pregnant.\u00a0 Her kind has a long gestation period, evidently.\u201d\u00a0 J'onn puts his hands on his hips. \u201cThey really bought into the assimilation thing, to the point where I don\u2019t know if she even thinks of herself as alien to earth \u2013 or rather just struck with an unfortunate series of birth defects that render her different from the average human.\u201d\u00a0 He sighs. \u201cWe were able to find out that much at least.\u201d\n\u201cAnd her radicalization?\u201d Kara asks. That\u2019s the part that interests her, because she\u2019s really curious how anyone who lives in the US these days could develop such a sentiment, when identity is so important to all the aliens Kara\u2019s ever met. \u00a0Even those who hide are torn, they hate that they have to hide, because they\u2019re proud of who they are\u2026 to spit on that legacy is unconscionable for Kara.\nWinn sighs. \u201cNot that I\u2019m listening in or anything, but I have an answer to her radicalization.\u201d He sits back, hands bridged behind his head.\u00a0 The circles underneath his eyes are nearly as dark as his hair.\u00a0 He yawns.\u00a0 Kara sips her coffee.\u00a0 \u201cI was following Lena Luthor\u2019s investigation, and looking at Emily Martin\u2019s, I think we\u2019ve uncovered a whole network of disaffected second-gen aliens. They\u2019re talking to each other. Mostly on Twitter, but there\u2019s a pretty active Facebook network as well.\u201d\n\u201cNothing on Instagram?\u201d Kara asks.\u00a0 \u201cBecause that\u2019s where Lena found her.\u201d\n\u201cThat might just have been the easiest one for Lena.\u00a0 Anything she tweets is connected to L-Corp, as she uses her twitter mainly for business related PR stuff. It isn\u2019t as personal as her hedonistic den of sin of an Instagram account.\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, Winn, it isn\u2019t that bad.\u201d Kara laughs.\u00a0\n\u201cSaw a pretty nice picture of you on there,\u201d Winn points out. \u201cAnd Emily posted some rant in the comments before Lena removed the comment \u2013 perks of being verified I guess \u2013 about how Lena was abandoning her convictions by getting with a new girl.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 I never saw that.\u201d Kara says.\n\u201cLena took it down almost as soon as it went up. I think because they were mutuals it showed up on her feed and she didn\u2019t want you to see it. It\u2019s still in the metadata though.\u201d\u00a0 Winn frowns. \u201cI think that was when Emily\u2019s twitter conversations started to light up with mentions\u00a0 of Lex Luthor and his technology. Before they were just using whatever cast off alien tech they could get their hands on.\u201d\n\u201cSo when you appeared on Ms. Luthor\u2019s social media feed,\u201d J'onn, bless him, plays the part of a confused dad so well. \u201cMs. Martin took it and the press release of the development and then retraction of L-Corp\u2019s alien detection technology as a sign that Ms. Luthor had abandoned the cause.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Kara frowns. \u201cLena was never involved in the cause in the first place.\u201d\nWinn nods. \u201cThat\u2019s where the crazy comes in.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s awfully ableist of you,\u201d Kara mutters. Winn glares. Kara crosses her arms and glares back.\u00a0 They\u2019re both exhausted.\u00a0 Kara feels like snapping.\u00a0 It\u2019s a bit of a mess.\u00a0 \u201cSo, are we good to consider this threat handled?\u201d she asks. \u201cAre there others like Emily Martin that we should round up?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a hydra,\u201d J'onn answers.\u00a0 \u201cCut off one head and two more take its place.\u00a0 We\u2019re aware of the situation now, I think this may become a long-term monitoring project for the DEO.\u00a0 But for now, the protests may continue, but there won\u2019t be any more alien-made violence at them for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nKara sags. It\u2019s a relief, a huge one slipping easily from her shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlex lets herself into Kara\u2019s apartment carrying a box of pizza and a six pack.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t get two, so you have to promise me you won\u2019t inhale the whole thing.\u201d\u00a0 Kara\u2019s picking through her clothes, trying to find something to wear.\u00a0 She\u2019s in her bra and underwear, Lena\u2019s borrowed shirt and jeans are neatly folded on the end of her bed.\u00a0 Alex comes to stand beside her.\u00a0 \u201cI thought we were chilling, it\u2019s Saturday night. Are you going out? Did I waste 20 bucks on a pizza you\u2019re not going to eat?\u201d\n\u201cLena asked me over.\u201d Kara says.\u00a0 \u201cI have to return her jeans anyway.\u201d She turns, smiling cheekily at Alex, \u201cAnd besides, you know I\u2019m always down for pizza.\u00a0 She\u2019s going to call when she gets home \u2013 she went to the office.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is with you and workaholic women,\u201d Alex mutters, pawing through Kara\u2019s clothes and finding a soft baby blue v-neck t-shirt.\u00a0 \u201cWear that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a t-shirt.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best color on you, and it\u2019s soft.\u201d Alex raises an eyebrow. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to be wearing it for very long.\u201d\n\u201cAlex!\u201d Kara hides behind her fingers. \u201cWhat if we\u2019re just going to like, hang out, eat dinner?\u201d\nSniggering, Alex holds the shirt out between two fingers.\u00a0 \u201cPut it on. We can\u2019t all be blinded by your radiance.\u201d\nSnatching the shirt away and scowling, Kara does. She pulls out a pair of battered-looking jeans so old they\u2019ve gone white in places and tugs them on too.\u00a0 \u201cHappy?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d The grin on Alex\u2019s face is warm.\u00a0 She reaches over and musses up Kara\u2019s hair.\u00a0 \u201cBeing this into someone looks good on you Kara.\u201d Kara sticks her tongue out at her.\u00a0 Alex shoves her and Kara\u2019s got the good grace to remember to stumble, just a little bit.\u00a0 But when she stops laughing, Kara watches her, watches her carefully.\u00a0 Alex looks like there\u2019s something on the tip of her tongue, the sort of look she gets before she segues into the more serious things she wants to have conversations about.\u00a0 \u201cI read your article.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cIt must have been really hard to write.\u201d Alex drifts back to the kitchen and collects plates and paper towels.\u00a0 \u201cLike, I know you were first on the scene and it was your periscope that got picked up by CNN and Fox, but for your first piece to be about the self-loathing alien who started this whole thing?\u00a0 That\u2026 must not have been easy.\u201d\n\u201cSnapper didn\u2019t like the idea,\u201d Kara confesses.\u00a0 \u201cAt least, not at first.\u00a0 He wanted me to write about the L-Corp connection, but I told him I couldn\u2019t.\u00a0 Not with whatever Lena and I are doing.\u201d Snapper had nearly gone postal at that, but Kara talked him down. \u201cSo I wrote about this instead. Because I didn\u2019t want Jeff to do it. I had to be the one, Alex. Because at least I could temper the rhetoric that was bound to come out after she got caught on camera.\u201d\u00a0 She takes the slice of pizza that Alex offers her and goes to sit on the couch.\u00a0 \u201cI hate this, Alex.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nKara shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s so divisive. The idea of an alien not wanting aliens on earth \u2013 I don\u2019t get it either, but she needed someone to speak for her. Now I\u2019ve spoken for her and\u2026her assimilation agenda and people hate me for it.\u201d Kara tries to eat the pizza, but it tastes like cardboard.\u00a0 \u201cWas that wrong?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you were fair?\u201d Alex sighs. \u201cNo, you did what you had to do in order to control that narrative before it ever got legs under it.\u00a0 It was a remarkable bit of PR, honestly. I\u2019m sure, somewhere Cat Grant is proud of it.\u201d\n(She is, she texted Kara a thumbs up emoji an hour ago. Kara doesn\u2019t mention it.)\nAlex pulls Kara close, hugs her. \u201cTurn off your notifications on your phone.\u201d\n\u201cBut how would I know when Lena\u2019s crazy followers call me Mom then?\u201d\u00a0 Alex bumps Kara\u2019s shoulder with her chin.\u00a0 Kara giggles.\u00a0 \u201cWhat? It\u2019s funny.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re far too much of an alien disaster to be trusted around children for prolonged periods to time, sister mine.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Kara says in mock indignation.\n\u201cI was right,\u201d Alex mutters a minute later.\u00a0 \u201cThis shirt is really soft.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLena calls around nine.\u00a0 Alex and Kara have watched half a season of Portlandia and have paused it to debate whether or not the Womyn in Womyn First skits are really as hilarious as they both find them.\u00a0 Kara feels uncomfortable because of Fred Armisen in a dress, Alex is more concerned that the skit is mocking a safe women\u2019s space. In the end, they\u2019re interrupted by Lena, and Alex steals the phone to demand to know what Lena thinks of Women in Women First.\u00a0 Kara just about dies of embarrassment, before promising Lena that she\u2019s on her way over, glaring at Alex and telling her to make the bed if she\u2019s sleeping over.\u00a0 Alex has had three beers now. She probably should sleep over.\n\u201cWill you be back?\u201d Alex asks.\nKara\u2019s cheeks color. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThey both know the answer is no, but Alex lets her pretend and Kara\u2019s grateful. The idea that she\u2019s going over to Lena\u2019s place because they\u2019re both so \u2013 as Lena\u2019s followers put it \u2013 thirsty for each other is silly. She wants to see Lena, to decompress and tell her about Emily Martin and what they were able to find out.\u00a0\nWhen Kara gets to Lena\u2019s that\u2019s what they do. Lena cooks some soup and makes a salad for herself, Kara eyes the soup hungrily until Lena gets down a second bowl and tears Kara off a hunk of thick sweet-smelling bread from a braided loaf that\u2019s still only half eaten. \u201cLeftover, from yesterday?\u201d Kara asks\u00a0even though she hadn't noticed it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an old habit.\u201d Lena says. \u201cI always have other things happening on Friday nights. This is my way, I guess. An indulgence and a gesture all at once.\u201d\nKara nods, eats her soup. She tells Lena about what Winn was able to dig up, and how the LuthorCorp tech that they found was old, at least five years by the looks of some of the chem signatures on it.\u00a0 Lena\u2019s eyes go a little wide at that, and she wants to know how they managed to date something like that.\u00a0 Kara shrugs, because she\u2019s not going to share DEO secrets with Lena, but she could tell her \u2013 tell her in Kryptonian science that Lena won\u2019t be able to understand.\u00a0 Kara\u2019s sure, though, now that the idea\u2019s in Lena\u2019s head, that it\u2019ll only be a manner of time.\n\u201cSo they\u2019re going to monitor?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Winn says thanks for the tip off, it really helped.\u201d Kara rolls a piece of the bread into a ball and pops it into her mouth.\u00a0 \u201cYour IT folks are on point. Also a quote.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell him thank you then,\u201d Lena says. \u201cNext time I see him.\u201d\nKara\u2019s phone beeps. It\u2019s another notification. Another piece of hateful BS about her pro-alien stance on a perceived terrorist.\u00a0 Kara turns the phone over.\n\u201cYour article?\u201d Lena asks.\u00a0 She chews a cucumber thoughtfully.\nKara looks down, hiding behind her hair. She hates this. Hates it so much. \u201cYeah.\u201d She says. \u201cPeople are being awful.\u201d\nLena wipes her mouth and fiddles with her casual work shirt for a minute before seeming to come to a conclusion.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s give them something else to talk about.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Kara frowns. \u201cI don\u2019t follow.\u201d\nLena takes her dish and Kara\u2019s away, sets them in the sink and runs water into the bowls.\u00a0 \u201cCan you start a Periscope?\u201d\n\u201cUh, sure.\u201d\u00a0 Kara says.\u00a0 \u201cWhat do you want to talk about on it?\u201d\n\u201cI want.\u201d Lena slides forward, into Kara\u2019s space, until she\u2019s insinuated between Kara\u2019s knees. \u201cTo give them something to talk about.\u201d Her hands are on Kara\u2019s shoulders, on the soft blue v-neck that Alex liked so much. She rocks forward, her forehead bumping gently against Kara\u2019s, her breath hot on Kara\u2019s lips.\nThere\u2019s this moment, this moment when Kara\u2019s realizing that Lena\u2019s too close and that this is wrong wrong wong for her to want it. She panics. Her hands clench into fists, tight, too tight on the table.\u00a0 She inhales slowly.\u00a0 Lena\u2019s breathing on her, this split second where she\u2019s waiting for a kiss.\u00a0 Kara knows she has to kiss Lena, but it\u2019s pushing past that freak out. That moment of this isn\u2019t right to realize that yeah, it is right.\nWhen she was a child, Astra used to tell her about these moments, when she\u2019d realize that there was something more important than anything else in the whole universe.\u00a0 \u201cYou have to grab those moments and hold them dear. You have to live in them.\u201d\nBut Astra was gone and Kara had no one else that she could talk to about this aching feeling of wrong-rightness in her stomach.\u00a0 Her mother was a hologram, her cousin was human in all but biology. She is the last Kryptonian, and it\u2019s this, this realization that she wants to do kiss Lena Luthor that\u2019s going to push her over the edge of whatever bullshit the Matrix and all her mother\u2019s stories from her childhood from her mind.\nShe\u2019s kissed people before, kissed them and had sex with them and it\u2019s been nice, but she\u2019s never wanted it. Not like this, not like her fingers twitching for want to reach out and grab Lena and push her up onto the counter and eat her out until she screams. Kara\u2019s never\u2026 wanted before. Alex had said being into someone looked good on her. Maybe Kara just had no idea what that meant.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a million miles away, Kara,\u201d Lena says.\u00a0 She pauses, brushes a finger against Kara\u2019s cheeks, her thumb on Kara\u2019s lips. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to\u2026 I know you said \u2013 with your upbringing\u2026\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s Lena. Lena who never has pushed and has always listened when Kara\u2019s said things like how she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable or she isn\u2019t sure she\u2019s wired the same way humans are. Lena, who makes Kara feel like she\u2019s on fire when she smiles, blessed by Rao\u2019s light.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d Kara says and she\u2019s breathless.\u00a0 \u201cI want\u2026 to do the Periscope later.\u201d\nLena draws back. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\nKara smiles at her. She wraps her arms around Lena and pulls her closer still. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d The kiss that comes is desperate. Lena gasps at Kara\u2019s fingers tangling in her hair, and tugging, gentle, firm. It feels a little backwards, but good. Kara likes it, but likes it more when Lena pushes back. Her hands grip Kara\u2019s shirt and she\u2019s kissing Kara with abandon, drawing her in, holding her close. She sucks on Kara\u2019s tongue, bites at her lip and moves down Kara\u2019s neck to confidently run her hands over Kara\u2019s chest. The sensation is so much. Lena plucks Kara\u2019s glasses from her face, sets them on the counter.\u00a0 Her hands come back, her tongue licking into Kara\u2019s mouth, Kara sucks obediently. It\u2019s what feels right.\u00a0 She kisses Lena and lets Lena grope her like some teenage boy, fingers flicking over her nipples through her shirt and bra.\nIt\u2019s only when Lena moves to unclasp Kara\u2019s bra that Kara pulls back. \u201cThe stool is going to fall over.\u201d\n\u201cThen we can do this on the floor.\u201d Lena mutters. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather your bed.\u201d\nLena steps back, her fingers trailing over Kara\u2019s forearms, before resting on her thighs. In that one moment she looks so uncertain that Kara wants to pull her back in. She bites her lip. It\u2019s kiss swollen. The look of it makes Kara\u2019s mouth go dry. \u201cWould you?\u201d Lena asks. \u201cI\u2019m fine here.\u201d\nKara flushes. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice bed. Where there isn\u2019t a stool that I could fall off at any moment.\u201d\n\u201cGood point.\u201d Lena says.\nThey go. Lena gets Kara out of her shirt and bra in the ten steps it takes for them to tumble onto the bed together.\u00a0 Kara has Lena\u2019s shirt rucked up and is pulling it over her head when the fall, but Lena\u2019s on top of her and staring down through a curtain of black hair and she\u2019s so, so gorgeous in her lacy black bra that Kara can\u2019t help herself.\u00a0 She reaches up, cupping Lena\u2019s breast.\nLena\u2019s eyes flutter shut.\u00a0 Kara moves her thumb in a slow, easy circle. Lena\u2019s breath comes in a slow shudder.\u00a0 She relaxes her elbows and bends her head to kiss Kara, this kiss is slow, opened mouthed passionate.\u00a0 Kara reaches around her and unsnaps her bra.\u00a0 Lena pulls back to throw it away.\u00a0 She wraps her arms around Kara\u2019s head, kissing her, their bodies pressed together, rocking into each other.\u00a0 Lena\u2019s so warm, so kind, so gentle when she doesn\u2019t need to be.\nKara moves her leg, gingerly, carefully, until she has enough leverage to roll them over without using her powers.\u00a0 She wants to be on top, to control the flow of this in case she freaks out. It\u2019s happened before \u2013 with James \u2013 with her first boyfriend. She has to dictate this if it\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0 She wants to kiss Lena all over, see her lose her composure and see her debouched. And it frightens her, because this isn\u2019t what she\u2019s supposed to feel.\nBut this isn\u2019t Krypton, and she\u2019s not ever going to have to deal with that again. Lena is something, something Kara wants to have, to taste, to fuck. And Kara\u2019s going do to it.\u00a0 Matrix be damned.\nShe presses open mouthed kisses onto Lena\u2019s neck, pausing when Lena lets out this little whimper, her fingers tangling in Kara\u2019s hair and tugging, pressing her mouth harder to the point where her shoulder met her collarbone.\u00a0 Kara bites, gentle, Lena gasps. Kara grins. She bites again, this time harder, and Lena\u2019s hand trembles on the back of her head.\nThere\u2019s an echo in Kara\u2019s ears as she lowers her lips to tease at Lena\u2019s collarbone, at her nipple, the rushing sound of her blood racing through her body.\u00a0 She bites again, and Lena\u2019s pushing her down. \u201cPlease Kara,\u201d she says. She sounds so desperate. Kara unbuttons Lena\u2019s pants, slides them and her underwear off at once.\u00a0 Lena\u2019s in her socks, which she toes off, her pupils blown and her chest heaving. There are marks on her chest, on her neck, on her breasts.\u00a0\nKara swallows down the feeling of pride and scoots forward. \u201cWhat do you like?\u201d she asks. This is the first time. \u201cOther than pulling my hair.\u201d\nLena flops back on the pillow. Kara runs a finger over the glistening hair between Lena\u2019s legs.\u00a0 She\u2019s wet. Kara catches the moisture on her finger and brings it to her lips. Lena watches her through hooded eyes. \u201cThat.\u201d She says. \u201cI like that.\u201d\nKara nudges Lena\u2019s ass. \u201cScoot up.\u201d She says.\u00a0 Lena does, until she\u2019s propped up on pillows and looking down at Kara.\u00a0 \u201cI gotta say,\u201d Kara says. \u201cThis is really different for me.\u201d\u00a0 She dips her lips to kiss at the juncture of Lena\u2019s thigh and hip.\u00a0 Her jeans feel uncomfortably tight.\u00a0 Kara\u2019s pretty sure she could grind against the seam and come.\n\u201cHow?\u201d Lena asks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t often\u2026 do this. Like this. I\u2019ve never\u2026.\u201d Kara bites her lip, looks away. \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted it so badly.\u201d\nLena smiles, wicked as can be with kiss swollen lips. \u201cSo indulge yourself. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nAnd Kara does.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nSunday - \n\n@KaraD4nvers is currently broadcasting on Periscope!\nKara holds the phone up with a grin on her face.\u00a0 \u201cHey Lena,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you want to come say hi to everyone?\u201d\nThe feed explodes. Hearts are everywhere.\u00a0 Kara props her phone up against the bowl of fruit on Lena\u2019s kitchen counter and scoots over so Lena can get into the frame of the camera beside her. Someone comments: MOMS ARE BROADCASTING YASSSSSSSS, and Lena raises an eyebrow before nudging Kara. \u201cHey, Kara\u2019s followers.\u201d\u00a0 She turns to Kara, a slow smile sliding across her face. \u201cHey babe.\u201d She leans in then, brushes her lips against the corner of Kara\u2019s mouth.\n@hiruuuummmn \u2013 A KISS!\n|\n@uriq \u2013 omg I cannot right now.\n|\n@karalena4eva I AM FREAKING OUT\n|\n@asdlfkkjiiu SAME THOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
