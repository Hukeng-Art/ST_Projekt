    "text": "\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPeter!\u201d\nPeter groaned, covering his face with his pillow. He rolled over to stare at the ceiling, covered wall-to-wall in glow-in-the-dark stars. If he ignored it, maybe it would go away.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It did not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPeter, get your ass out here now!\u201d The voice yelled again. Peter lifted his head blearily from the pillow. \"Fine, I'm coming!\"\n\u00a0\nA couple of minutes later, dressed hastily in a hoodie and jeans, Peter wandered into the kitchen. He was met with a sea of faces turned his way, emotions ranging from highly amused to mildly baffled. The only one who seemed annoyed was Tony Stark, who was currently staring at the teenager, a piece of paper clutched in his fist.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWere you gonna tell me about the trip, kid?\u201d Tony asked. Peter shrugged. He moved over to the counter, opening several cupboards before he found a slightly-crushed box of frosted flakes. He poured himself a bowl, painfully aware of the silence in the kitchen.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI mean, it seems kinda pointless?\u201d He said. \u201cI could just stay in bed all day instead\u2026?\u201d\nClint and Steve, who had been holding in their laughter, shared smiles of utter glee. Peter glanced between them suspiciously. \u201cLook, there\u2019s really no point, I\u2019m just going to head off\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony snagged his backpack and hauled the retreating teenager backwards. Peter yelped as Tony shoved the form into his hands. \u201cNot a chance. I better see you later, kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Natasha snorted into her coffee.\n--\nPeter didn\u2019t exactly have a normal life.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t, since he was fourteen and an ill-fated trip to Oscorp had left him with genetic mutations and a small, fang-shaped scar on the back of his neck.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At least then life had mostly carried on like normal for a few weeks, weird powers aside. Then Uncle Ben had died, and Spider-Man was born.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Needless to say, things went downhill from there.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Aunt May, unable to cope with the responsibility of caring for the teenager by herself, had sent Peter away, to live with his godfather and father\u2019s closest friend, Tony Stark. The lifestyle change had been jarring at first, but Peter had gotten used to his new family over the next year or so. When Tony and Steve became Peter\u2019s legal guardians, it felt like the most natural thing in the world.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not long after that, Peter had told the heroes about his alter-ego, and after a rough couple of weeks, he\u2019d gained his fathers\u2019 acceptance and a new super-suit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, Peter was eighteen, having found a comfortable balance between masquerading as Spider-Man and keeping his grades up (because god forbid Tony Stark\u2019s son be anything less than a genius), with a host of bizarre and mildly dangerous family members surrounding him at all times.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He lived at the Avengers Compound upstate, making the drive to school every day in his Aunt\u2019s old mini. Tony hated that car, but Peter refused to let his Dad buy him a new one.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So yeah, Peter didn\u2019t exactly have a normal life.\n--\nMr Harrington looked more than a little tired as he herded the group of teenagers onto the battered and disgusting bus. Thankfully for Peter, this meant that the teacher didn\u2019t give a second glance to the signature written on the bottom of his form.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Technically, no one knew that Tony Stark was Peter\u2019s guardian. On his emergency contact forms at school, Tony had ensured that his real name wasn\u2019t on them, in case any less-than-honest receptionist sold Iron Man\u2019s personal mobile number to the media or worse. The same went for Steve, who\u2019d been insistent that his number was added to the forms. That had been a weird conversation, Peter thought with a smile as he got on the bus, followed closely by Ned and MJ.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The three friends sat down together, Ned and MJ muttering excitedly about what awaited them at the Avengers Compound. Peter was less enthused.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you think we\u2019ll meet any of the Avengers?\u201d A voice from the row behind them could be heard saying excitedly. Peter buried his face in his hands.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGod, I hope not.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy\u2019s that, Penis?\u201d Someone else exclaimed loudly. Peter prayed the ground would swallow him whole, but to no avail. The smug face of Flash Thompson appeared in his periphery. \u201cAfraid they\u2019re gonna call you out on your bullshit lies? \u2018Mr. Stark\u2019s internship\u2019 my ass. Next, you\u2019ll tell me you know every Avenger personally, huh? They\u2019re your best friends?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter looked away, trying to ignore him, and Flash flicked his ear painfully. \u201cAnswer me, weirdo.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course I don\u2019t.\u201d Peter said stiffly. \u201cI\u2019m just an intern. That would be stupid.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter was lying through his teeth, and he knew it. He knew every single resident of the compound, and some who only dropped in every so often, would contest that point fiercely. Still, Peter would rather keep that knowledge to himself than give Flash more ammunition than he already had.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhatever. I can\u2019t wait to see your face when they don\u2019t even let you into the building.\u201d Flash muttered, retreating back to his seat. Ned nudged Peter\u2019s shoulder gently, and gave his friend a quiet smile, as they pulled up at the impressive building.\n--\nThere are some people Tony is always pleased to see. People he\u2019d never get sick of turning up on his doorstep, or in his lab, unexpectedly. The trio currently in front of him, however, were not those people. He could not have wanted this less. Tony sighed heavily and raised a brow. \u201cTry again, from the beginning. No lying this time.\u201d He said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deadpool opened his mouth, to start talking, but Steven Strange stepped in before the other man could say a word.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI'm sorry to bother you, Tony. I found these two outside Peter\u2019s window. They won\u2019t tell me why they were there and- just- you know what happens when Peter hangs out with both of them.\u201d Strange finished, looking exasperated. Wade was openly grinning, but Loki\u2019s face remained void of emotion, save a raised eyebrow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018What were you guys planning on dragging my kid into this time?\u201d Tony said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve missed him, metalhead. And we were both in town, so we thought\u2014\u201d Tony cut Wade off.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou realise he\u2019s a teenager. He has a life outside of being an Avenger, and he has grades he promised me he\u2019d maintain. Peter is in school!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBoss, Peter just scanned into the building.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony sighed. \u201cHelpful, Friday, very helpful.\u201d He turned to Strange. \u201cI gotta go keep the rest of the team out of trouble. Chuck these idiots out somewhere. And if Loki\u2019s about, Thor won\u2019t be hard to find. Keep the Asgardians away from my lab.\u201d\n--\nPeter trailed slightly behind his class, preparing himself for the worst. The receptionist, Lisa, was handing the teenagers temporary key cards. Even MJ and Ned, who were over for weekend stays fairly often, were still only allowed low-level passes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere are ten levels of pass,\u201d Lisa explained. \u201c1 being the lowest, for guests that have to be accompanied at all times. That\u2019s you lot.\nLevels 2 and 3 are for guests with more access. Level 4 is for interns who have to have permission to enter labs. Levels 5 and 6 for part-time and full-time employees. Levels 7 and 8 are for the Avengers, level 8 for the ones that live in the compound. Level 9 is for the CEO, Ms. Potts, and close family of Tony Stark, including Steve Rogers. Level 10 is for those with all-access.\u201d She paused.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure whether this is classified information, but only four people have ever had level 10 passes, one of them being Stark himself. No one but those four have unadulterated permission to access Tony Stark\u2019s private lab. It\u2019s where he builds the Avengers\u2019 classified equipment.\u201d\nPeter knew all this already. He, Bruce and Tony were the only ones with access to that lab, although he was the one to usually get loaded with the task of having to clean up after the three\u2019s disastrous experiments. Shuri technically had a level 7 pass but would occasionally be given a temporary level 10 pass. To Steve\u2019s constant chagrin, he had yet to be given a level 10 pass, something Peter found thoroughly amusing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He suddenly realized that he probably should\u2019ve gotten a fake pass for the day. People started filing through the barrier, and he clutched his keycard anxiously. To his immense relief, the barrier opened for him without him even having to scan in.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWelcome home, Peter. Steve has requested I inform you that it was Bucky that broke the waffle-maker, not him. Tony has asked me to inform you that you still have restricted access from his lab. Wanda has asked me to inform you that she, Hope, and Natasha have decided on \u2018Sixteen candles\u2019 for movie night.\u201d The AI paused. \u201cRestricted access, Peter. Tony was adamant about it.\u201d \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peter went scarlet.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUh, thanks, Friday.\u201d He said, painfully aware that his class was staring at him, utterly baffled. Peter flushed. The restricted access thing had a simple explanation; he and the princess of Wakanda may\u2019ve accidentally messed up the formula for a new web fluid, and it may\u2019ve accidentally exploded half of Tony\u2019s prototypes, causing him to kick them both out and ban them- PERMANENTLY- from his lab. Not that either of the teenagers actually listened to the warnings, but that was irrelevant. Whether or not Dr. Banner snuck them the passcode was none of their business.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, so maybe it wasn\u2019t an explanation he could give to his peers. MJ, who\u2019d heard the story through Shuri, cracked a slight smile, and, despite the warning, Peter was allowed through. He tried to ignore the triumphant look Flash was giving his friends.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHi everyone! I\u2019m Ellie, I\u2019ll be your tour guide for the day!\u201d A woman said brightly, ushering the class forwards. Ellie was only a few years older than Peter, in her last year of college. She and Peter had become fairly good friends, with similar interests and both often tasked with taking care of the Avengers equipment. After several all-nighters with the woman, Peter liked her so much that he\u2019d asked Tony to guarantee her a position at the compound after college. \u201cNow, before we get going, does anyone have any questions?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUh, yeah.\u201d Flash said smugly. \u201cIs Parker actually an intern here? Because I read that you only take college-level interns, and only five a year?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ellie looked baffled. \u201cOf course he\u2019s not!\u201d She said. \u201cPeter hasn\u2019t been an intern here for years now!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter knew Ellie meant well, but he\u2019d never wanted to disappear quite as much as he did in that moment. He could feel Flash\u2019s smug stare on his back and curled into himself.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They walked through the hallways for a minute, Ellie giving a run-down of the layout of the labs. Peter wasn\u2019t really listening, figuring if he missed something he didn\u2019t already know he could just ask literally anyone in the building. Or ask her to give him another tour.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust through here, Ladies and Gentlemen, is the Avenger\u2019s personal garage. If you would follow me.\u201d Ellie ushered them into the garage, Peter\u2019s classmates looking around in awe at the fancy vehicles surrounding them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis is Captain America\u2019s motorbike.\u201d Ellie began, \u201cIn storage since the forties, it was painstakingly restored by Stark himself, when the Captain was discovered in the ice. It is the Captain\u2019s vehicle of choice and it\u2019s not uncommon to see him riding around the area with his shield strapped to the front.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCan we touch it?\u201d Someone piped up. Ellie shook her head, and there were a few disappointed whispers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThese cars are all Tony Stark\u2019s,\u201d Ellie continued, gesturing to the row of fancy convertibles, before turning towards the more average, rundown vehicles. \u201cAnd these belong to the rest of the Avengers. Although they look ordinary, all of these cars and bikes are outfitted with access to Stark\u2019s AI, and high-tech defense mechanisms. I would advise against touching any of them.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter could feel the car keys in his back pocket, looking at his own car sat between Clint\u2019s pickup and Natasha\u2019s Harley-Davidson. He\u2019d had driving lessons at some point from every Avenger, with the exception of Wanda. She was only a few years older than him and had never learnt how. He hoped none of his classmates recognized his car - explaining why it was in the Avengers\u2019 private garage would be difficult.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They passed through the garage, everyone looking closely at the cars. Peter hoped he hadn\u2019t left any ID visible in his car. Or any fast food wrappers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After everyone had finished questioning why there was a green motorcycle chained to the wall \u2013 It was Loki\u2019s, confiscated after Stark had been concerned for the safety of his Avengers (see: Loki let Peter have a ride and Tony did not approve) \u2013 they finally moved out of the garage and towards the rest of the compound.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter and the group followed Ellie down a hall, before they were stopped. Peter, at the back of the group, didn\u2019t see who it was, but immediately recognised the voice. \u201cIf you would come right this way, everyone. I\u2019ll be taking over the tour through the Avengers\u2019 quarters. Normally, we would never allow tour groups to pass through here, but the other route is currently out of commission due to construction work. I ask you to be respectful, this is their home.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter stood on his tiptoes and made eye contact with Pepper Potts, his pseudo-mom. She gave him a bright grin, her fake smile becoming real. \u201cPeter!\u201d She said. Perfectly on cue, there was a loud crash from behind the door Pepper had just stepped out of.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The door opened to reveal a slightly frazzled looking Sam. He grimaced at the sight of the baffled teenagers. \u201cSorry to interrupt, Pepper. I thought we heard you say that Peter was home. I wanted to challenge the twerp to a Smash Bros rematch.\u201d There was another crash, and a loud shout of \u2018motherFUCKER\u2019, followed by a sarcastic chorus of \u2018language!\u2019. Sam glanced back anxiously. \u201cI gotta go clean up this mess. See ya later, kids.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ned leaned backwards to hiss in Peter\u2019s ear over the mumbles of their classmates. \u201cWas that Captain America\u2019s voice?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYup. I think he\u2019s trying to fix the waffle maker.\u201d Peter sighed. \"He keeps breaking the kitchen stuff - I think it's a mixture of accidental super-strength and having no idea how modern technology works.\" Pepper beckoned the group forwards, and Peter regretfully passed the Avengers\u2019 kitchen, wishing he could sneak away from the tour group to join the team.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pepper led them all into the training room, and Peter could barely repress his groan. He spent hours in that room every week, and he definitely didn\u2019t need a tour. In fact, he could give a better tour, called \u2018things I\u2019ve accidentally broken and weapons I\u2019ve been beat up with\u2019.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the corner, Natasha, Wanda and Scott were sparring. Everyone watched in amazement as Scott seemingly vanished into thin air, before reappearing again in a different place a few seconds later, knocking Natasha off her feet. The woman landed gracefully, though, immediately flipping upright again. Wanda\u2019s hands sparked with energy, but she relaxed when she spotted the tour group. The others did the same.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The three walked over, Scott reaching out to fist-bump Peter on his way past. Natasha raised an eyebrow, taking in the way Peter shifted to the back of the crowd, or the way numerous people shot the teenager unkind glances. She felt a rush of protectiveness, especially when she saw one of the little prats lean over to whisper in Peter\u2019s ear.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey Penis, how are you gonna talk your way out of this one?\u201d Flash whispered. Peter hunched his shoulders, praying that the bully wouldn\u2019t embarrass him in front of his family. Flash smirked and folded his arms.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNow, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d Scott began. \u201cYou probably think our ability to win every fight is a matter of superpowers and technology. You\u2026 would be correct. However, we also put in hours of training every day to stay battle ready. Our training is tailored to our specific skillset. For example,\u201d Scott gestured to the metal poles spanning the high ceiling. They looked similar to monkey-bars but varied in thicknesses and heights. \u201cWhen Spider-Man moved in, Stark built in this, enabling the hero to use his more specific skills in the safety of the training room.\u201d Scott chuckled. \u201cThe Avengers that can fly also tend to perch up there a lot. I once found Bucky up there. Not entirely sure how he managed that one\u2026\u201d Scott faded off, trying to puzzle it out in his mind. Natasha stepped forwards, pressing a quick kiss to Pepper\u2019s cheek and addressing the students.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt would be too dangerous to allow you to use our weapons, or spar with any of us. In fact, I\u2019ve only ever met one kid your age who can match any of us in a fight.\u201d She winked at Peter, whose eyes widened. \u201cSo, instead, you\u2019re going to move through here and towards the labs.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pepper spoke up. \u201cI\u2019d like to remind you all that the area you\u2019ll be passing is the Avengers\u2019 living space. Please be respectful of their privacy and remember they\u2019re technically very dangerous individuals.\u201d She glanced at Wanda, then at Peter. \u201cEspecially the teenagers.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They passed through the training room, and through hallways and flights of stairs that Peter knew like the back of his hand. As they walked down the hallways, Peter was jerked backwards by a hand on his collar. Before he knew it, he was shoved against a wall, Flash smirking down at him menacingly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d He gasped out, winded, \u201cIs your problem, Flash?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou think you\u2019re so special just because an Avenger looked at you?\u201d Flash spat. \u201cIn case you\u2019ve forgotten, Penis, you\u2019re still just a nerdy nobody.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Flash released him, but before Peter could catch his breath, a fist hit him in the jawbone. By the time he recovered, Flash had followed the group and disappeared. Peter, too concerned about catching up with the tour group to worry about the bruise blooming across his jaw, hurried forwards.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He caught up with the group just as they walked past his bedroom door. His slightly openbedroom door. A few people peered around the door, and the whispering grew so loud that Pepper paused. She laughed when she saw what they were whispering about.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat would be Spider-Man\u2019s bedroom.\u201d Pepper said. The whispers grew excited. \u201cHe does value his privacy, as one of the few Avengers who hasn\u2019t revealed his identity to the public. I\u2019d advise against intruding.\u201d She asked Friday to shut the door, and it slammed shut, with the click of a lock falling into place.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell us about Spider-Man!\u201d Someone said. Pepper glanced at Peter, who smiled.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSpider-Man moved here with the rest of the Avengers after Tony Stark sold Avengers Tower, although he was not publicly an Avenger at this time. He still spends a large amount of his time in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, where he works with the Daredevil, and of course in Queens, his hometown and the area of the city he regularly patrols. He and Stark conducted a few experiments, concluding that he can lift up to 10 tons without difficulties, yet had been recorded to lift heavier weight in life-or-death situations. He doesn\u2019t need his costume to stick to walls, but his web-shooters are of his own invention. He\u2019s also the favourite superhero of every single Avenger, although Spider-Man\u2019s favourite superhero is Captain America.\u201d Pepper glanced at Peter, taking note of his red-tinged ears.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy\u2019s there a Star Wars poster in his room?\u201d Betty asked loudly. Peter sighed inwardly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI would like to say that Spider-Man is our resident nerd,\u201d Pepper began with a sigh, \u201cBut Tony built himself a fully functioning sonic screwdriver, and Falcon\u2019s video game collection is a force to be reckoned with.\u201d She laughed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow come Spider-Man lives in the compound? I thought he lived in Queens?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t say much without revealing too much about his personal life, but we\u2019re his family, as much as he is ours. Thankfully, the commute to the city is only about 10 minutes on the jet, and about an hour by car, and Spider-Man knows that Tony Stark would probably buy back the tower for him if he asked nicely.\u201d She shot Peter a wink, and he ducked his head sheepishly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The tour group carried on, still muttering about Spider-Man. Peter waited for them to turn the corner, before slipping into his room. The door knob scanned his finger-prints, and the door opened easily for him. There was still a mattress on the floor from the last time Wade had stayed over, complete with burrito crumbs and, as he discovered previously, a glock under the pillow. How Wade had managed to leave his firearms everywhere, he didn\u2019t know, but Peter was impressed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He grabbed his phone from where it had been charging on his desk, and rushed off to catch up with the class, making sure to firmly close his door.\n\u00a0\nEventually, they made it to one of the public labs. Peter knew that Bruce would be working in there at that time and was surprised when the tour group was allowed in - Bruce normally didn\u2019t let people disturb him whilst he was working. He was even more surprised when he saw the back of a very familiar head.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t known his best friend was in the country.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bruce introduced himself to the group as Doctor Banner, giving a brief mention of how he worked closely with the Avengers and failing to mention how he was an Avenger. Peter raised a brow. Bruce Banner was as much a part of the team as the Hulk was, and Peter made a mental note to remind the man of that later.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shuri, on the other hand, didn\u2019t even turn around until Bruce asked her to introduce herself. She instantly caught Peter\u2019s eye, and thoroughly enjoyed totally ignoring his pleading look. \u201cI\u2019m Shuri, technology and research leader of Wakanda. And I\u2019m a Princess, but that\u2019s boring.\u201d She shrugged, glancing between the tour group\u2019s mildly stunned faces. \u201cAnyway, who wants to hear about the time Peter and Bucky got stuck in\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShuri, why don\u2019t you tell the group what you\u2019re working on?\u201d Pepper interrupted, and Peter breathed a sigh of relief. Shuri looked disappointed but grabbed the object she had been studying anyway. His class shot him confused glances, but the focus quickly shifted from Shuri knowing his name to the technology in her hand.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo, Spider-Man and I were talking, and we were wondering about the possibility of integrating Wakandan technology with P- uh, Spider-Man\u2019s original tech. Tony greenlit the project, because he thinks it\u2019ll make the Spidey-suit safer. He\u2019s probably wrong about that, knowing Spider-Man and his ability to find trouble literally everywhere. It\u2019s quite impressive. Anyway, here\u2019s a prototype I was working on.\u201d Shuri held up the object smugly. Most of the students had no idea what they were looking at, but Peter knew. He\u2019d helped build it, after all. It was a web-shooter that had been ripped from one of his old suits and modified. He knew it like the back of his hand. That meant he also saw what was about to happen before anyone else did.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUh, Shuri?\u201d He said, Spidey-sense flaring up.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, Pete?\u201d She said, still fiddling with the machinery.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou might want to\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It exploded into flames. Peter, acting on instinct, shoved the princess out of the way, and caught the burning metal in his hands. Before any pain set in, he tossed it in a perfect arc, where it landed in the fire-proof trashcan, a feature Tony had added after one-too-many exploding experiments. Shuri, from where she\u2019d been thrown to the floor, let out a surprised laugh, standing up. Peter had pushed her out the way before she could be hurt, and she was totally unharmed aside from damaged pride.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was not expecting that!\u201d She said, sounding far too excited. \u201cThe web fluid must have reacted with the raw vibranium! I wonder if this happens when the webs interact with Cap\u2019s shield?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bruce helped Peter to his feet, checking his hands gently. The palms were red and raw, but nowhere near as damaged as they should\u2019ve been. Peter tugged his sleeves down over his hands and prayed none of his classmates asked questions. The burns would be gone in a couple of hours anyway.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 None of them did, surprisingly. A few of them were staring at him, but no one questioned it. Pepper ran a hand through his hair gently, but the rest of the tour group, including Mr. Harrington, were watching in surprised silence as Shuri was half inside the trashcan, digging for the now-extinguished prototype.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She pulled it out with a triumphant yell, before dropping it with a yelp. It clattered to the floor, and she glanced at the group sheepishly. \u201cIt\u2019s still hot.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLet me show you some of the older super-suits.\u201d Bruce said, after everyone had settled down. As Bruce talked through the original Iron Man suit, Peter suddenly became aware that someone was stood behind him. He whirled around, finding himself face-to-face with Clint, who\u2019d just dropped down from an open vent. The Avenger grinned, and leaned forwards, towards Peter. They did a quick handshake, one they\u2019d come up with the very first time they\u2019d ever met, laughing quietly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m trying to find my hearing aids, Nat stole them.\u201d Clint began in a hushed voice. \u201cAlso, Thor.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s on earth?\u201d Peter signed, surprised.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLoki is. And if Loki\u2019s here, Thor generally is too. Just, let me know if you see him.\u201d Clint said, and hesitated. \u201cI thought Thor would\u2019ve attached himself to Banner by now. The guy\u2019s like a lost puppy, it\u2019s hilarious. Loki\u2019s supposedly being watched by Strange, but he\u2019ll probably turn up at some point. The guy\u2019s weirdly slippery.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter and Clint followed Peter\u2019s class for a moment, before the group noticed the presence of Hawkeye.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh my god it\u2019s actually him!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHawkeye, can I get an autograph?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s an actual Avenger!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter translated a few of the things he knew Clint wouldn\u2019t have been able to lip-read, and the man laughed. He pat Peter on the shoulder and waved at the rest of the class.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou seen Wade yet, Pete?\u201d He asked the boy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI thought he was out all day?\u201d He asked, knowing none of his classmates knew ASL. \u201cOn a mission with SHIELD, last I knew. Dad kicked him out the other day.\u201d \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe got back earlier, wanted to talk to you. You know no one can keep Wade away from you.\u201d Clint said. \u201cNow, I gotta go track down an Asgardian.\u201d With that, he disappeared back into the vent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter really, really hoped Wade didn\u2019t find him. He was more than fine with his classmates not knowing he lived with the Avengers, let alone that he was dating a superhero. That was too few steps away from them finding out he was an Avenger.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, and Pete?\u201d Clint popped his head out of the vents. \u201cGood luck.\u201d\n--\n\u201cYou see the kid\u2019s jaw?\u201d Clint asked Natasha. \u201cPretty nasty bruise. Wonder what happened.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She frowned. \u201cPeter wasn\u2019t bruised when I saw him.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Steve and Bucky, sat on the sofa nearby, looked up. Steve\u2019s brow was furrowed, and he looked worried. Bucky had immediately understood, and he looked quietly livid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFriday,\u201d Natasha asked. \u2018Did you see any unusual behaviour from Pete? Or how he got bruised?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Friday was silent for a moment. \u201cPulling up the footage now, Miss Romanoff. Peter asked that I not show Boss or the Captain, but I think it best you see this.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The four Avengers in the room watched the footage of Peter getting punched in the face in deadly silence. Steve was the angriest, Peter being his son. He stood up stiffly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI gotta go talk to Tony.\u201d He said quietly. The others pretended not to notice when Steve wiped his eyes hurriedly as he waked out. Bucky was the next to stand up.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNeed to find my guns.\u2019 He said gruffly. Natasha and Clint followed soon after.\n--\nLoki watched the footage back with a stony face.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cM\u2019kay, so are you feeling up for some murdering? Because I really am.\u201d Wade said. Loki could hear from his voice that the merc was barely restraining his anger. He felt similar.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPerhaps our plans will have to change.\u201d He said. \u201cI doubt the Avengers will give that boy quite what he has coming.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re speaking my language, horn-head! Let\u2019s go unalive a teenager, then take Spidey-babe out for tacos.\u201d\n--\nShuri caught up to the tour group as they were reaching one of Tony\u2019s labs. She grabbed Peter by the wrist, and MJ, spotting the other girl, also lagged behind.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThanks for earlier, Peter.\u201d Shuri said. \u201cSometimes I forget the really obvious things. That\u2019s what I keep you around for. And, y\u2019know, you can be smart. Sometimes.\u201d She said. MJ snorted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s no problem, Shuri. Next time, though, wait until I\u2019m there before messing with the web fluid. Not even Dad knows the exact formula.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out one day, web-face.\u201d She grumbled.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MJ leaned forwards to give Shuri a quick peck on the cheek. Shuri flushed, and MJ dragged Peter away, cackling.\n\u00a0\nWhen the tour group walked into the lab, Tony Stark was talking in a hushed voice to Captain America, both looking extremely worried. The men spotted the group, and Steve excused himself, giving Peter a long, indecipherable look before walking through the door into the living room. Tony looked tense, something Peter had learned to notice in his dad over the few years he\u2019d lived with them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome this way, everyone,\u201d Pepper ushered the group towards one side of the room, where a few of the scientists were ready to show the students their work. Whilst everyone was distracted, Tony pulled Peter and Pepper to the side. His hand hovered over the bruise, concern evident in his eyes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me people were doing this to you, kid?\u201d Tony said softly. Peter looked at the floor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From the other side of the room, a loud grating voice exclaimed, \u201cPenis Parker\u2019s gonna get thrown out by Tony Stark!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony stiffened. Peter looked up at his dad with pleading eyes. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do anything. I don\u2019t want him to\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow long, Peter?\u201d Tony said. \u201cHas that boy been bullying you?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know, since middle school? When I was still living with May, before the bite.\u201d Peter said with a shrug. \u201cBut I heal fast, and it doesn\u2019t bother me anymore, it\u2019s fine, dad.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony gave Peter a brief hug. \u201cOkay, \u2018intern\u2019,\u201d He said softly. \u201cHelp me with the presentation to your class?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSure\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The door burst open, and two men barrelled in, arguing loudly. It took Peter a moment to recognise them; Sam and Bucky, the latter carrying a large machine gun. They made a beeline for Peter, Bucky pushing past Flash a little rougher than necessary. Sam grabbed Peter by the shoulders.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPete.\u201d Sam said sombrely. \u201cThis complete dick,\u201d With a deadpan look at Bucky, who shrugged, \u201cInsists milk goes BEFORE cereal! I mean what sort of psychopath thinks that\u2019s even remotely normal! What the shit!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter studied Bucky. He\u2019d definitely watched the super-soldier make a bowl of lucky charms that morning, and Buck did not put milk before cereal. The man smirked, and Peter grinned at Sam, before glancing at the slightly ajar door to the living room.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Steve could definitely hear them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cY\u2019know,\u201d Peter said loudly, feigning a thoughtful tone, \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t be an issue if we could just have waffles for breakfast instead, but someone broke the waffle-maker.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bucky, Sam and Tony, surrounding Peter, fought to keep their faces straight. From the other room, a faint \u2018low blow, Pete!\u2019 could be heard.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter\u2019s classmates and teacher were watching the exchange in surprise, and Tony caught on quickly, tossing an arm across Peter\u2019s shoulders.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPeter here is my favourite intern,\u201d He explained proudly to the group. \u201cThe kid has done more for Stark Industries than any of our full-time employees.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Flash raised his hand. \u201cOur tour guide earlier said Peter wasn\u2019t an intern, and Stark Industries don\u2019t take high-school age interns.\u201d He said, only sounding slightly snarky in the face of the world-famous billionaire.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLikely because Peter\u2019s much more than an intern here, even though it\u2019s his official job.\u201d Tony paused. \u201cWe made an exception for this kid, because he\u2019s the embodiment of what my company tries to be. Unlike you, by the looks of it.\u201d Flash paled and dropped his hand. Peter blushed and pretended he couldn\u2019t hear his Pops laughing from the living room. \u201cWhile you\u2019re here, before your lunch break, any other questions?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho\u2019s your favourite Avenger?\u201d Someone asked.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSpider-Man, next.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you got any funny stories about the Avengers?\u201d Betty asked shyly. Sam cut in at that point with a triumphant grin.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve got a great one.\u201d He began. Both Bucky and Peter\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAbout everyone\u2019s favourite Spider-Man, and the wonderful Bucky Barnes. I also have a video of this one, and you can all find it on YouTube no problem. I highly recommend you do. Anyway.\u201d He cleared his throat dramatically. \u201cThey both took the day off in New York, and our two heroes came across a little girl, crying because her cat was stuck in a tree! Being the dumbasses that they are, they decided the only way to retrieve the cat would be for both of them to climb the tree, which they failed spectacularly. They got so stuck\u2014\u201d Here Sam had to pause, giggling uncontrollably. Bucky gave him a death glare. \u201cThey got so stuck in Spider-Man\u2019s webs, the NYFD had to leave them there for almost two hours,because they didn\u2019t know how to remove the webbing! In the end, Stark had to cut them free!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most of Peter\u2019s classmates were giggling at the story. Bucky\u2019s stony face did a good job at quelling the laughs, though, and eventually Tony cleared his throat. \u201cAny more questions?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDid you make Ms. Potts CEO because you\u2019re dating her?\u201d A snarky voice asked. Peter recognised him as one of Flash\u2019s friends. Tony simply raised an eyebrow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI made Pepper CEO because there\u2019s no one more well-suited to the job.\u201d He replied honestly. \u201cAlso, if Pepper and I are dating, someone should tell her wife. Next?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho\u2019s the youngest Avenger?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t tell you, but I can tell you that our youngest hero, now 18, started this gig when they were 14.\u201d Tony paused for a moment. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t be prouder. Although I recommend none of you seek out superpowers, at any age. Leave it to the Avengers.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd that\u2019s time, everyone. If you would follow me to the canteen, you can have your lunch break.\u201d Pepper said, herding the teenagers through the door.\n\u00a0\nThey headed to the intern\u2019s canteen, much to Peter\u2019s relief. Not that he expected his class to even be allowed near the Avenger\u2019s dining room, he wouldn\u2019t put it past his trouble-seeking family to organise that. Peter, sat between Ned and MJ as everyone began fishing their lunches out of their bags, relaxed in his seat.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then he realised he\u2019d forgotten his lunch.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll be right back!\u201d He told his friends, manoeuvring between tables.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPeter, where are you going?\u201d Mr. Harrington asked. Peter paused, thinking on his feet.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUh, toilet?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe toilets are the other way, Peter.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cRight. Sorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cursing mentally, Peter walked off to the other side of the canteen, taking the long route around, through hallways and up and down a couple flights of stairs. When he reached the door, he opened it slowly, not knowing who was in the room.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The door slid open to reveal a large, comfortable-looking kitchen and dining room. It would\u2019ve looked perfectly ordinary and domestic, decorated tastefully and with soft, warm lighting, if not for the obvious anomalies.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For starters, the dining table looked to seat about twenty, with benches instead of chairs. On the counter was the mangled remains of what Peter took to be the fateful waffle-maker, and the handle of the fridge was hanging by a single screw, no doubt from when someone with super-strength had shut the door too hard. The fruit bowl in the middle of the table currently held, aside from an excess of plums, a battered Iron Man helmet, a grenade, and a whole peeled banana. Peter wasn\u2019t entirely sure he wanted to know why.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through a small archway was the living room, where Peter could hear the familiar sounds of Smash Bros, meaning at the very least, Sam was around. Vision was sat at the dining table, staring intensely at someone\u2019s abandoned phone. The cloak of levitation was hovering nearby, and Peter couldn\u2019t help but grin when he saw it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter opened the fridge, careful not to disrupt the precarious handle, in case he was blamed for breaking it, and surveyed the contents. He pushed aside Tony\u2019s half-eaten tuna sandwich, and the left-over curry that Clint had made the team the previous night. He sighed as he pulled an ancient-looking war-hammer off of the top shelf, placing it on the table behind him. At the very back of the fridge was a small box, labelled \u2018Peter\u2019. He grabbed it and slammed the fridge shut without thinking. The handle fell off with an appropriately dramatic clatter. Before anyone could catch him in the kitchen, Peter webbed the cookie jar, catching it when he pulled it off of the top of the cupboard. He stuffed a couple of cookies in his pocket, and carefully placed the jar on the counter.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What was the point of trying to hide the cookie jar when you live with a bunch of super-humans, Peter thought with a sigh.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He retreated from the kitchen, careful not to disturb Vision, and returned to the canteen.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did you get?\u201d Ned asked eagerly. Peter narrowed his eyes at the innocent-looking Tupperware, before deciding that his Spidey-sense would\u2019ve alerted him if it was threatening.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He took the lid off cautiously, breathing a sigh of relief at the sight of his ordinary cheese sandwich. \u201cPops must\u2019ve made my lunch this morning.\u201d He said. \u201cHe\u2019s the only one that doesn\u2019t mess with it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ned shuddered. \u2018Remember when there were flies in your sandwich?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy family think they\u2019re hilarious.\u201d Peter said, deadpan. Then he lifted up the top of his sandwich, quickly checking the insides. \u201cWe\u2019re fly free.\u201d He said with a sigh of relief. MJ stopped eating for a moment to stare at him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYour family are weird as shit, dude.\u201d She said, raising an eyebrow. Peter shrugged, and Ned nodded vigorously.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSuddenly, there was a loud crash, and Peter looked up to see Loki Laufeyson lying on the table in front of him, having fallen through a portal. The Norse god groaned slightly and tilted his head to look Peter in the eyes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was looking for you!\u201d\u00a0 He exclaimed, before Stephen Strange grabbed him by the collar and hauled him off his feet. The cafeteria watched in stunned silence as Loki winked at Peter, took a bite of the cheese sandwich he\u2019d somehow grabbed, and vanished into thin air.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAw, my lunch.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strange sighed, pinching his nose. \u201cPlease tell me.\u201d He said, exasperated, \u201cThat I didn\u2019t just lose Loki?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He looked up at Peter, who shrugged. \u201cSorry, Stephen. Can you get my sandwich back?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYour goddamn father.\u201d Strange said, defeated, \u201cIs going to kill me.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He disappeared into a shower of orange sparks, leaving the canteen utterly silent. Most of the interns and workers had carried on as if nothing had happened, but the students were frozen. Ellie, the tour guide from earlier, stood up and clapped her hands together.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf I could have your attention please, Midtown! I know that seemed a little scary, but I can assure you it\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary here. This place is the home of the Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes, after all! You have ten more minutes to finish your lunch, and then we\u2019ll be continuing our tour.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was a tap on Peter\u2019s shoulder, and he turned with a start, only to see there was no one there, just a few green sparks hanging in the air. He turned back, to catch sight of Flash snickering at him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter was thankful that none of the Avengers he\u2019d encountered so far had embarrassed him too much.\n\u00a0\nThe next stage of the tour took them to the Avengers Museum; technically, it started as nothing but a storage room where Tony kept all of their old suits, but when tour groups started being allowed in, he had turned it into a display.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter had only ever momentarily been in the museum, having worked on most of the suits and therefore having little interest in looking at them. His classmates, though, were excitedly chattering, pointing out the suits of their favourite heroes. Peter wandered around for a moment, before stopping in his tracks at the sight of a very familiar suit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His suit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 More accurately, the first Spider-Man suit that Tony had ever made him, after discovering his secret. Peter was touched to see the suit stood in pride of place between the original Captain America suit, and the mark II Iron Man suit. He pressed his fingers to the glass, a small bio of Spider-Man appearing.\n\u00a0\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man.\n\n\nFull name: unknown \n\n\nAge: unknown\n\n\nMutate \n\n\nThis Queens-based hero has made a great impact on the world in the past few years. First emerging through YouTube clips and reports of small-time crimes being prevented, the hero eventually caught the attention of Tony Stark, and has since aided the Avengers in missions. \n\n\nHe gained official status as an Avenger two years ago, after his role in the Infinity War. Spider-Man remains the only Avenger who has never killed another living being and prides himself on a strict moral code. He\u2019s one of the few modern heroes to keep his true identity a secret. Spider-Man is widely considered the most loyal Avenger, and is one of the strongest, next to Thor and The Hulk. He\u2019s the perfect example of what it means to be a hero.\n\n\nWe\u2019re proud of you, son. \n\nPeter stepped back, blinking rapidly. He stared at the message with wide eyes for a moment, before Flash shoved him out of the way.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBet this is the closest you\u2019ve ever been to the real Spider-Man, huh, Penis.\u201d Flash said. \u201cMove, I want a picture with the suit.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter moved without a word, still touched by the message. He continued his walk through winding corridors, pausing in front of the case that held Deadpool\u2019s suit. The mannequin that held the suit was crouched mid-superhero pose. Peter stared at it for a moment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWade, I know that\u2019s you.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The suit relaxed, and Peter could feel the grin through the red mask. \u201cYeah, no shit.\u201d Wade said, standing up and scratching the back of his neck. \u201cCan you unlock the case? I didn\u2019t think this through and I got stuck.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter obliged, giving Wade a long-suffering look, and before he knew it he had a mercenary following him around like a lost puppy, and a bunch of very confused classmates.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUh, Pete.\u201d Ned said slowly. \u201cDeadpool\u2019s stood behind you.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The few classmates that were nearby approached, looking excited but understandably apprehensive. Peter mentally cursed, realising this was going to be a little more difficult to explain than his usual internship excuse.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Peter was lost in thought, he didn\u2019t notice the merc moving closer until Wade dropped his chin on top of Peter\u2019s head. \u201cIs this your class?\u201d He asked. Peter knew Wade was looking at his classmates suspiciously, probably feeling a little paranoid, so he stepped to the side, letting his wrist subtly brush against Wade\u2019s hand.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, they are. You\u2019ve met Ned and MJ, right?\u201d He said softly. Wade tilted his head for a moment, then nodded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhite said we have, yeah.\u201d He replied, fondly. \u201cYou kids are cool.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rest of Peter\u2019s class, including Emily and Mr. Harrington, who were talking amicably, rounded the corner. They stopped short at the sight of Wade, who also froze. Emily frowned, and Wade gave her a quick salute, marred only by the fact that he was holding a handgun.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMr. Wilson.\u201d Emily said cautiously.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLast time I checked.\u201d Wade replied. \u201cYou\u2019re looking wonderful, Em.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be under the supervision of Dr. Strange.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEh, he was boring. I wanted to come and see my favourite tour guide!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve met once, Mr. Wilson.\u201d Emily said, sounding amused. \u201cAnd that was only through Spider-Man.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I was looking for the web-head. I left my favourite gun in his bedroom\u2026 I\u2019ll be on my way now DONTTELLSTARKORROGERSIWASHERETHANKYOUSEEYA!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wade dashed out of the room, winking at Peter before he flung himself out of the window. Peter sighed, and shrugged at MJ, who was giving him a bemused look. Emily hid a laugh behind her hand.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSorry about that, everyone.\u201d She said. \u201cFriday, if you could alert Ms. Potts to a broken window in the east wing of the Avengers Museum, please?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMs. Potts has been informed of the damage.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWas that Deadpool?\u201d A girl asked, looking impressed. \u201cAnd does he know Peter?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat was him! Deadpool has been working closely with the Avengers in recent years, something most of us attribute to Spider-Man\u2019s good influence. In fact, I\u2019ve only met two people that Deadpool actually listens to \u2013 Spider-Man and Peter. I don\u2019t quite understand how they do it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Everyone turned their eyes to Peter.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSince when do you know Deadpool?\u201d Harry, one of Peter\u2019s friends from the decathlon team, asked incredulously.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUh, Mr. Stark usually gives me the job of mending Deadpool\u2019s suit after missions. We got talking, I guess?\u201d Peter said slowly. It was technically the truth. Tony always gave Peter the job of wrangling Deadpool because the merc didn\u2019t trust anyone else with his suit, or anything else about him. Of course, this came after they\u2019d become close friends (and later started dating), but Peter decided to leave that part out. His class looked appropriately impressed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They finished their tour of the museum with no further surprises, Peter finally allowing himself to let his guard down as it didn\u2019t seem like his family would be causing any more trouble.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEmily led them out of the museum and towards the elevators. The elevator door opened to reveal a harassed-looking Clint, and Thor, who was grinning brightly. Clint blinked at the class for a moment, before dropping his shoulders.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI found Thor. He\u2019s your problem now.\u201d He said to Peter, walking off. Thor caught sight of Peter, and his smile brightened further.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPeter!\u201d The man said, bounding over to crush Peter in a tight hug, that lifted him off the ground. Thor knew that Peter had strength that rivalled his own and had never been afraid of manhandling him (or handing him his ass during training sessions), but his hugs were still bone-crushing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter\u2019s class were star-struck. Gwen, a fiery blonde (who Peter had once had an impressive crush on), was the first one brave enough to speak up.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat the fuck is Thor doing on earth?\u201d She said, then blushed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to say that out loud.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thor laughed. \u201cI followed Loki. He came to Midgard to visit the Man of Spiders, and I decided it would be excellent fun to join him.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Steve had taken it upon himself to explain the concept of a secret identity to Thor, the first time he\u2019d met Peter out of the Spider-Man suit. At first, Thor hadn\u2019t understood, but when he found out it could put Peter in danger, he swore to keep the secret. He still slipped up, however, but not enough for anyone to put the pieces together. Peter and Thor had become close friends over Thor\u2019s frequent visits to Earth. Eventually, the god had moved from \u2018Mr. Thor\u2019 to \u2018Uncle Thor\u2019, something he was extremely proud of. He\u2019d boasted to Loki for weeks before Loki also became \u2018Uncle Loki\u2019.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Emily broke the brief silence. \u201cMr. Thor, do you have time to answer a few questions, or do you need to find Spider-Man?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thor glanced at Peter for a moment, worried. \u201cUh, I believe I must go. I was seeking out the Captain and the Man of Iron. Peter?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019ll be in the living room, I think.\u201d Peter said, forgetting about his classmates. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where Loki is, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thor ruffled Peter\u2019s hair fondly and turned to the rest of the class. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I must leave you. It\u2019s been wonderful to meet Peter\u2019s companions.\u201d He scanned the crowd and waved. \u201cOh, hello again, MJ! I did not realise you were here! Lady Sif has asked me to tell you that she misses you dreadfully!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MJ, to her credit, didn\u2019t look fazed. She\u2019d seen a lot of weird things being one of Peter\u2019s closest friends, one of those things being her surprising friendship with the Asgardian warrior. She gave Thor a brief thumbs-up, trying to hide her smile in her book.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thor walked off, leaving the teenagers in stunned silence. Even Flash was in awe of the god. Emily guided the group into the the elevator, listening to the excited muttering with a smile.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She took a moment to look at Peter. Emily was one of the higher-ups in the company, meaning she came into frequent contact with Tony Stark, and the rest of the Avengers. She wasn\u2019t blind to how they treated Peter like he was their collective son. She was rather fond of the boy herself, seeing how he went out of his way to help everyone he could, and being amusing and intelligent to boot. She knew there was something odd about him, though. She caught him once in the hallway, carrying an injured Deadpool with ease as if he was a baby, not a fully-grown man, 200 pounds of pure muscle.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Emily remembered an interaction she\u2019d had with Peter, when she was a new employee and he was young, maybe 14 or 15. She worked in one of the labs at Stark Tower, and he sat quietly in the corner, watching her.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCan I help?\u201d \n\n\nEmily looked up in surprise. She\u2019d been ignoring the kid, assuming that he was waiting for someone, but he was now watching over her shoulder. He looked out of place but didn\u2019t seem to be a troublemaker. She raised her eyebrows. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a little complicated, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d She said, gesturing to the prototype Stark Phone she was assembling. The boy shrugged. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou put that in the wrong place.\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou put the chip in the wrong place.\u201d He said again. Emily looked down at what she was doing.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh shit!\u201d\n\n\nThe kid laughed a little, before snapping his jaw shut and looking embarrassed. She quickly fixed her mistake and looked back up, to see he\u2019d sat back down. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know much about Stark technology, then--\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cPeter.\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHi, Peter. I\u2019m Emily.\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHi. And yeah. I used to remodel old Stark Phones, that I found in the trash, but Mr. Stark says I should just ask him for parts instead of dumpster-diving.\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Emily looked up again, in shock that the teenager had direct interactions with Stark. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGreat.\u201d She said with a smile. \u201cCould you tell me what I\u2019m doing wrong here? The battery should be working, but it\u2019s the thinner model and I can\u2019t figure out why it\u2019s not\u2026\u201d She trailed off, frowning down at the phone. Peter walked back over and examined the phone. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHere.\u201d He said. With delicate fingers, he drew out a hair-thin copper wire, before discarding it. \u201cIt\u2019s simple logic, right? Scale it down, and there are going to be unnecessary parts. This is arc reactor tech, so not all of these particular wires,\u201d He gestured to a group of wires, \u201cAre going to connect to the battery anymore.\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho are you, kid?\u201d Emily asked quietly. Peter\u2019s face fell. \n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m no one.\u201d He said. \u201cNot really.\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Emily could see the kid was troubled. She gave him a sympathetic smile. \u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dads. My, uh, adopted dads, that is, are fighting really badly at the moment.\u201d Peter said quietly, his voice cracking a little. \u201cI\u2019m scared that one of them is going to do something drastic. They aren\u2019t listening to me, and I don\u2019t want to pick a side, and\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPeter. Slow down, kid.\u201d Emily said. \u201cDo you think your dads really love each other?\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, I know they do.\u201d Peter cracked a smile. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about that. I think they\u2019re both scared.\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf what?\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf losing the people they care about. I don\u2019t know how to make them see that though. They never listen to me, Emily!\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Emily put down the tools she was holding. \u201cSometimes you have to make them listen. They love you, so they\u2019ll pay attention whether they want to or not.\u201d She grinned. \u201cSometimes you gotta raise a little hell, kid.\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter grinned as well, brushing away a few tears. He opened his mouth to say something, when the lab door burst open. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPeter! There you are!\u201d Tony Stark said. Emily froze, intimidated. Peter rushed over to the man. \u201cNext time, at least tell Friday you\u2019re leaving the penthouse. You\u2019re impossible.\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter and Tony Stark walked out together, Peter flashing Emily a final smile, leaving her wondering who the hell the kid was. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe saw him a lot more after that interaction, sometimes helped him on projects and sometimes got his help on her projects.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Emily shook herself out of her thoughts as the elevator opened again. She led the teenagers through the lobby, where they were told to stop, huddled in a group. The teenagers talked amongst themselves whilst Emily spoke to someone over the phone.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The door slid open, and two men walked in. They were followed by a harried-looking blonde woman. One of the men, a blind man with a cane, paused and cocked his head. He turned his head towards Peter. The other man followed the blind man\u2019s gaze.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey Karen, it\u2019s Matt\u2019s kid!\u201d Foggy Nelson exclaimed, making his way over and ruffling Peter\u2019s hair. Peter raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in school, bud?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s on a school trip, Foggy.\u201d Matt said, making his way over. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t stop complaining about it.\u201d He said, with a raised brow aimed for Peter.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He blushed, but grinned when Matt raised his fist reluctantly. \u201cTeam Red?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter bumped his fist. \u201cTeam Red!\u201d\nThe rest of Peter\u2019s class looked lost. Karen tugged at Foggy\u2019s collar. \u201cWe have a meeting with Ms. Potts like, right now, in case you two forgot why we\u2019re here. Lovely to see you, Peter.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two lawyers walked off, dragged away by an exasperated Karen. Flash smirked. \u201cFigures the only person that\u2019d want to be friends with Puny Parker is a blind guy. Is he deaf, too, or does he just not listen when you talk, Penis?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From the way Matt\u2019s shoulders tensed from the other side of the room, Peter figured the Daredevil had heard Flash\u2019s insults. Still, Matt followed Karen and Foggy out the room, and Peter figured that Flash had dodged a bullet.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Emily was still glued to her phone, the conversation seeming to get more heated, and she didn\u2019t notice as the elevator doors opened again. Peter\u2019s class milled around, spread around the foyer, chatting and poking at displays.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony Stark walked out first, followed by an angry-looking Strange. Tony made a beeline for Peter, where he checked the boy over quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re okay?\u201d Tony asked. Peter nodded, too confused to answer coherently.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strange raised an eyebrow at Tony, who shrugged. Strange sighed. \u201cLook, Tony. Loki isn\u2019t technically\u2026 dangerous, currently. He\u2019s not going to hurt Peter, you\u2019re just being overprotective.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From behind them, there was a startled yell. The three whirled around, to see a boy dangling by his ankle high in the air. His ankle was surrounded by a bright green mist.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFlash!\u201d Peter gasped. Tony cursed and turned to Peter.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs he the boy that bruised you?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, he\u2026 wait, how do you know that?\u201d Peter frowned.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot important.\u201d Tony shook his head. \u201cThe issue is that you have this uncanny ability to make people want to protect you, kiddo.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strange had already moved away, attempting to help Flash down. The magic was strong, though, and Flash was being thrown around as he was moved out of Strange\u2019s reach. He was cursing up a storm, and Mr. Harrington looked like he was about to have an aneurysm.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony ran forward as well, and Peter found himself suddenly caught in a strong pair of arms. \u201cWade.\u201d He said, exasperated. \u201cDoes this have something to do with you?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All he got in return was a chuckle, as he watched Tony and Strange tugging at Flash\u2019s arms, as the boy screamed in terror. Peter slipped out of Wade\u2019s arms.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLoki!\u201d Peter yelled, as loud as he could. Everyone turned towards him. \u201cPut him down!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was a beat of silence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Flash suddenly dropped to the floor. He was caught by Strange\u2019s magic just before he hit the ground, but no one helped him up. In the centre of the room, Loki appeared in a flash of green. He strode towards Peter contentedly, grinning like a maniac. Peter tried to stare him down but fought back a slight smile in the face of his friend. Loki stopped a few steps away from Peter.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWas the punishment satisfactory, young Peter?\u201d Loki said, quirking a brow. Peter shook his head.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis was all unnecessary, Loki. You could\u2019ve seriously hurt him!\u201d Peter said. Loki\u2019s smile dropped a little, before he grinned blindingly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was going to kill him, but your boyfriend advised against it. Odd, I believe he wanted to murder the man just as much as I did.\u201d Loki shrugged. \u201cRegardless, I\u2019m in Midgard for a few days. You told me you\u2019d show me New York, and Wade offered to accompany us.\u201d From over Peter\u2019s shoulder, Wade nodded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter paused. \u201cThat sounds amazing, Loki, but right now probably isn\u2019t the best time to talk about this.\u201d He said. \u201cIn fact, I think you should probably get out of here.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Loki smirked again. He turned towards Strange and Tony, who were storming towards them. Tony, surprisingly, didn\u2019t look that angry. Neither did Strange, but he did look exasperated when Loki vanished.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt was an illusion. Figures.\u201d Strange said, turning dramatically and striding out the room. Flash was clearly fine, sat on the floor with his arms crossed, looking more like a disgruntled child than the senior that he was. Tony glared at Wade, but ruffled Peter\u2019s hair.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve got to go, but I\u2019ll see you later, Pete. Sam wants a Smash rematch, and I want to watch him get destroyed.\u201d Tony paused. \u201cWhy he thinks he could beat someone who\u2019s superpowers are literally super reflexes in a video game, I have no idea, but it\u2019s fun to watch. I gotta go. Love you, kiddo.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony left the room, dragging Wade behind him, and left Peter awkwardly trying to avoid eye contact with his classmates. Mr. Harrington had finished talking to Emily, who looked apologetic but surprisingly calm. She shot Peter a wink.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy are all the superheroes talking to Peter?\u201d Someone asked. Peter flushed under the attention.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cProbably because they recognise me?\u201d Peter said, voice strained. \u201cI mean, I work with them sometimes?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, bullshit.\u201d Harry said. \u201cThey all treat you like- their kid, or something.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter cleared his throat sheepishly. \u201cYeah, about that.\u201d"
