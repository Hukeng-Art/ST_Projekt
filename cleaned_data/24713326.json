    "text": "Wei Wuxian wakes up, parched like you wouldn\u2019t believe, clearly in a hospital, with Jiang Cheng by his side, stuffing his face with what smells like Jiang Yanli\u2019s handmade dumplings.\n\u201cOf course your ugly mug is the first sight I see when I wake up,\u201d Wei Wuxian croaks, and grins when Jiang Cheng chokes on his food.\n\u201cAbout time you bloody woke up,\u201d Jiang Cheng mutters, but there\u2019s clear relief in his features, and he sets down his lunch in favour of bringing a glass of water to Wei Wuxian, so Wei Wuxian figures they\u2019re alright. \u201cYou\u2019ve been sleeping for two whole days, you asshole. Everyone\u2019s been worried.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. He tries shifting around a little. He feels achy all over, but it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s broken anything important, so he should be fine? \n\u201cYou fell off a goddamn flight of stairs,\u201d Jiang Cheng tells him, \u201ccracked your skull, bled all over ma\u2019s new carpet, and gave a-jie the fright of her life, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\nWei Wuxian winces. \u201cIs a-yi really upset about her carpet?\u201d he asks, thinking about the telling off he\u2019s no doubt going to receive once Yu Ziyuan deems that he\u2019s recovered enough to be able to take it. \nJiang Cheng cuffs him gently \u2014or well, as gently as Jiang Cheng knows how\u2014 over the head. \u201cMa\u2019s been worried about you as well, you idiot.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not like Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t know that his presence in the Jiang family has caused Yu Ziyuan and Jiang Fengmian a lot of conflict. Yu Ziyuan is, well, rightfully stern when it comes to him. Wei Wuxian honestly tries his best to be on his best behaviour just so he doesn\u2019t exacerbate their relationship, but he\u2019s...him, and well, trouble really likes him\n\u201cI\u2019ll message everyone to tell them that you\u2019re awake,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cA-jie just left about half an hour ago to go get some rest, but she\u2019ll want to come back immediately.\u201d\nWei Wuxian makes a face. \u201cThen just tell her later. Let her get some sleep,\u201d he suggests. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m going anywhere.\u201d\nJiang Cheng rolls his eyes. \u201cYou know she\u2019ll be upset if I don\u2019t tell her,\u201d he says, even as his fingers fly across his phone, probably already typing the message out to Jiang Yanli. \u201cAlso, you\u2019ll have to call Lan Wangji to tell him yourself, because Lan Xichen and I made the decision not to tell Lan Wangji first so he wouldn\u2019t board the first plane back to make sure that you\u2019re alright, and miss his conference. You know he\u2019s been working hard on it.\u201d He makes a face then, and looks up at Wei Wuxian. \u201cYou really need to sort your relationship out with Lan Wangji, for fuck\u2019s sake. It\u2019s been almost five years. How long do you want to drag this courtship thing out for?\u201d\nWei Wuxian blinks. \u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been texting Lan Wangji for the last two days, pretending to be you!\u201d Jiang Cheng complains. \u201cHe got suspicious because I didn\u2019t harass him over texts! I had to call him Lan er-gege! I had to use emojis! I had to fucking ask him if he thinks you\u2019re pretty!\u201d \nWei Wuxian has no idea what Jiang Cheng is talking about, but it feels important to at least ask, \u201cDid he think I was pretty?\u201d\nJiang Cheng rolls his eyes so hard Wei Wuxian is surprised his eyeballs don\u2019t just fall out of his eye sockets. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst part. He did. Whatever mating ritual you both have going on is so fucking weird, Wei Wuxian.\u201d He snorts. \u201cIf you\u2019d stayed asleep for any longer, I\u2019d have lost my shit and thrown my myself out a window just so I wouldn\u2019t have to talk to Lan Wangji again.\u201d \n\n\nWei Wuxian blinks at him. \u201cIs this a good time to ask who Lan Wangji is?\u201d \n\n\n\n\nJiang Cheng glares at him. \u201cYour Lan Zhan,\u201d he says, annoyed. Wei Wuxian must look as confused as he feels, because Jiang Cheng\u2019s annoyance bleeds out into concern. \u201cYour Lan er-gege? Your soulmate, Lan Wangji?\u201d \n\n\n\n\nWei Wuxian shakes his head. \u201cNo bells are ringing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nJiang Cheng sucks in a sharp breath. \u201cWhat year do you think it is, Wei Wuxian?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u201c2001,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and then cracks up when Jiang Cheng\u2019s eyes widen in alarm. \u201cCalm down, I\u2019m just kidding. I know it\u2019s 2014.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nJiang Cheng stares at him. \n\n\n\n\nWei Wuxian is quiet for a beat. \u201cI presume from your reaction that it is not actually 2014.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jiang Cheng says softly. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\nSo, right. \n\n\n\n\nApparently the effects of cracking his head open on some staircases is that he loses six whole years of his memories. That\u2019s a huge check in the \u2018no, do not do again\u2019 column. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad, a-jie,\u201d Wei Wuxian tries to say, when Jiang Yanli tries and fails to stop herself from crying when Dr. Lan gives his diagnosis. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good thing that I forgot!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDr. Lan\u2019s smile thins. \u201cI can think of at least one person who would object to that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThere is an animosity in Dr. Lan\u2019s voice that surprises Wei Wuxian. \u201cDr. Lan?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Dr. Lan says, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be rude. That was unfair of me.\u201d He smiles at Wei Wuxian and his siblings. \u201cI\u2019ll let you both catch up in private.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Lan Xichen,\u201d Jiang Yanli explains when Dr. Lan is out the door. \u201cHe\u2019s Lan Wangji\u2019s brother.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nAh. \n\n\n\n\nSoulmate Lan Wangji.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLan Wangji and I were very close?\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs. \n\n\n\n\nJiang Yanli smiles. \u201cInseparable,\u201d she tells him. \u201cEvery spare second you both have, you spend together. When you\u2019re not together, you\u2019re constantly texting him, or on the phone with him.\u201d Her smile turns a little teasing, and she reaches out to ruffle his hair. \u201cI think it\u2019s cute that you\u2019re such good friends.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nJiang Cheng snorts. \u201cGood friends,\u201d he echoes. \u201cA-jie, just because he went and lost all his memories, doesn\u2019t mean that everyone else has to forget that he has the most embarrassing crush on Lan Wangji.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u201cA-Cheng,\u201d Jiang Yanli chides, but there is no heat in her voice, and she says nothing else to defend Wei Wuxian, which means she\u2019s essentially confirming Jiang Cheng\u2019s words. \n\n\n\n\nWei Wuxian groans. \n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\nHe only thinks to look into his phone later that night, when his family has gone home to rest, and Wei Wuxian is left unable to sleep. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI told Lan Wangji that you were working on something urgent for work, so he knows you won\u2019t be texting much,\u201d Jiang Cheng had told him earlier, \u201cbut send him a text at least once a day to let him know you\u2019re alive? He would very likely jump on the next flight back if he even thought there was something wrong with you.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nWei Wuxian stares at the message icon on his homescreen for long enough that his phone auto-locks, and then finally gets the courage to tap into it, and then into his chat history with Lan Wangji. \n\n\n\n\nHe cringes almost immediately when he sees that Lan Wangji is saved in his phone as \u201cEr-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\u201d. \n\n\n\n\nWei Wuxian wants to die. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be like this,\u201d he says to himself. \u201cWhat the fuck is this? Who the hell have I become?\u201d \n\n\n\n\nHe scrolls back through their texts, making sure to skip through all the ones where Jiang Cheng was impersonating him, and finds horrifying material such as: \n\n\n\n\nTo: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nsafe flight!!!! remember to text me when you land!!! and when you\u2019ve cleared customs!!!! and when you\u2019ve collected your luggage!!! and when you get on your ride!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nMn. Don\u2019t skip dinner just because I\u2019m not there to remind you to eat.\nTo: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\ni won\u2019t!! ahhhhhhhh lan zhan i miss you already what do i do\n\nFrom: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nI\u2019m still here. I don\u2019t have to go.\nTo: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nnooooo don\u2019t give me ideas\nTo: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nyou\u2019ll be back soon and i\u2019ll text you every time i miss you!!!\nTo: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nyou\u2019ll text me every time you miss me too right????\n\nFrom: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nThen I\u2019ll be texting Wei Ying constantly.\n\nFrom: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nI have to turn my phone off now. I will call you when I arrive at Moling. Goodbye, Wei Ying.\nTo: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nAHHHHHHHHHH ER GEGE\nWei Wuxian\u2019s face heats. Lan Wangji sounds like an experienced flirt. Surely no-one can come up with devastating replies like that if they weren\u2019t a player! No wonder Wei Wuxian has a crush on him! \nHe keeps scrolling.\nIn response to Lan Wangji obliging to his request for a selfie, Wei Wuxian finds that he\u2019s replied with: \nTo: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nMY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LAN ZHAN YOU LOOK SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOOK AT YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WAH!!!!!! HOW CAN SOMEONE LOOK SO GOOD!!!!!\nLan Wangji\u2019s hand must have accidentally shaken when he took the photo, because the photo came out shaky and slightly blurred. The angle he chose is also all wrong, Wei Wuxian can only see three quarters of his face. It\u2019s a terrible photo, considering all things, except-\nExcept Lan Wangji still looks good for some ridiculous reason or another. \nHuh. His reaction wasn\u2019t that exaggerated after all. \nThe moment the thought comes to him, he shakes it off. \u201cNope, nope, nope,\u201d he whispers to himself, and scrolls up.\n\nFrom: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nI\u2019ll bring you food. What do you want?\nTo: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nlan zhan have i ever told you that i love you\nTo: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nI MEAN\nTo: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nwho else is ever going to be this good to me in my life\nTo: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nno one!!!!\nTo: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\njust you!!!!\n\nFrom: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nMn. No-one. Just me. \nTo: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\ni love you so much i\u2019m so lucky you\u2019re my best friend lan zhan\n\u201cBest friend?\u201d Wei Wuxian mouths to himself. This is the most embarrassing thing that he\u2019s ever had to read. \u201cBest friend? Wei Wuxian, what the fuck are you saying? That was a prime confession opportunity!\u201d\nHe spends the better part of the night scrolling through their conversations. He learns that Jiang Yanli is right when she says that they text each other constantly; Lan Wangji is his first text every morning, and last text every night. \nThey talk to each other about everything and nothing \u2014 Wei Wuxian asks for Lan Wangji\u2019s opinion on what lunch to order (Lan Wangji always picks the healthiest option), Lan Wangji asks whether he should treat himself to a cup of green tea latte from the cafe he likes even though he has the necessary ingredients to make it for himself at home (Wei Wuxian always says yes, and tells him he should get the sweet scones he likes too), Wei Wuxian whines about Jiang Cheng, Lan Wangji complains in a stilted, polite way about his family gatherings. \nIt\u2019s all a bit much.\nJiang Cheng says that they\u2019ve known each other for a little under five years years now, and that Wei Wuxian has had a crush on him for, well, a little under five years now. It\u2019s embarrassingly clear that he has a crush on Lan Wangji, and it looks like Lan Wangji reciprocates at least on some level. If this is how they behave on a daily basis, Wei Wuxian can\u2019t really think of a single reason why they\u2019re not together! \nThere must be something he\u2019s missing.\n\u2014\nWei Wuxian\u2019s room at home is exactly as he expects it to be. \n\u201cSo nothing much has changed, huh?\u201d he asks Jiang Cheng. \nJiang Cheng snorts. \u201cYes, you are still as much of a mess as you were five years ago.\u201d\n\u201cGood to know that my defining characteristics never change,\u201d Wei Wuxian says with a grin, and catches the pillow that Jiang Cheng throws at him in exasperation. \nHe does a more thorough onceover of the room \u2014 Jiang Cheng is right to call it a mess, but it feels like a familiar, organised mess to Wei Wuxian. He can tell from a glance which his most loved pieces of clothing are (the ones that are hanging off a chair, as opposed to the ones that are dumped on the floor), what projects he\u2019s working on (clearly, the one that\u2019s spread out over his desk and by the floor of his bed), and- \n\u201cWhat in the fuck?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, picking up a framed photo of Lan Wangji from his bedside table. \nLan Wangji\u2019s face is angled towards the sun in the photo, his eyes are closed, and there is the barest hint of a smile on his face. It\u2019s a good photo, Lan Wangji is objectively beautiful, but surely, surely having a framed photo of Lan Wangji in his room would be too much? \nJiang Cheng snorts. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s how I feel about this too.\u201d \n\u201cDid I...lose a bet?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks.\n\u201cNope,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, popping his \u2018p\u2019 loudly. \n\u201cDid he make me?\u201d \n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. He looks more amused than he has any reason to be. \nWei Wuxian hates the smugness radiating off Jiang Cheng right now, but he has to be sure, and Jiang Cheng is as good a source of information as he\u2019s going to get until he gets his memories back. \u201cSo you mean to say that this is genuinely how I am. I have such a huge crush on Lan Wangji that I felt the need to place a framed photo of him on my bedside table.\u201d\nJiang Cheng nods solemnly. \u201cYou hide that photo when he comes over,\u201d he tells Wei Wuxian, \u201cbecause even you have to acknowledge how embarrassing it is that you\u2019re like this.\u201d\n\u201cJesus fucking Christ,\u201d Wei Wuxian swears. \u201cAm I really like this?\u201d \nJiang Cheng nods again. \u201cWorse, to be honest,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause you used to refuse to even acknowledge that you have a problem, before.\u201d \n\u201cFuck,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, with feeling. And then, gingerly, \u201cIs this the worst of it?\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, I wish I could say yes, but there\u2019s probably heaps more embarrassing stuff that you try to keep me from finding out,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. His grin widens. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to find out exactly how embarrassing you are so you can have a proper meltdown.\u201d\nWei Wuxian flashes him the finger, and Jiang Cheng cracks up laughing. \n\u2014\nOn Jiang Cheng\u2019s advice to try to figure out the depths of his patheticness, Wei Wuxian logs onto his laptop.\nIt takes him two tries to figure out that his password is lanergege. That much was apparent when the hint for the password was just a series of smoochy face emojis. \nWei Wuxian almost wishes he remembered the exact moment when he set this password so that he could smack himself over the head.\nHe almost expects his wallpaper to also be of Lan Wangji\u2019s face, but it just turns out to be a pair of rabbits. He sighs in relief. Rabbits! That\u2019s not so bad! He has other interests outside of Lan Wangji! He likes fluffy animals! He\u2019s just like any other normal human being with normal interests!\nHe messes around with his laptop for a couple of hours. It\u2019s fun looking through photo albums to sort of give him an idea of the sort of growth he\u2019s gone through the last six years, even if he does take a good ten minutes to freak out over how Lan Wangji was apparently invited to their Lunar New Year Eve reunion dinner in 2018, and then in 2019 brought Lan Xichen along as well. \nHe invited Lan Wangji to their reunion dinner! The reunion dinner!\nThere aren\u2019t that many photos that he has together with Lan Wangji, but he does have a lot of candids of the man. Wei Wuxian is apparently that sort of person who would take seventeen photos of his napping friend, and not delete a single one of them, even if they all look the same to him now. He wonders what he was thinking when he took the photos, and then remembers that the heart-eyes emoji is apparently his favourite emoji to use when he\u2019s texting Lan Wangji, and decides that he doesn\u2019t really want to find out. \nHe\u2019s already gone through all his available photo albums, scrolled through his entire iTunes library, browsed through his work folders and emails, before he plugs his headphones in, and clicks into what must be his encrypted porn folder. \nThe password is easy enough to guess, and blessedly not any variation of Lan Wangji\u2019s name. Wei Wuxian is just about to pat himself on the back for not being a complete loss cause when he clicks into the first video on the list.\nHe makes it through fifteen seconds, before he clicks out of it, and goes for the second video. This time, he only needs eight seconds to confirm his theory. He goes to the third video, the fourth, the fifth through till the end, and-\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Wei Wuxian breathes out, because shit, most of the actors in the video bear at least a passable resemblance to Lan Wangji. \nThis is apparently what he gets off to now, because he is the worst. \nThere is an audio file in the folder that Wei Wuxian is almost afraid to play. He thinks he knows its contents, but he still comes incredibly close to throwing his laptop out of his window when he eventually opens the file, and finds that it\u2019s just someone \u2014presumably Lan Wangji\u2014 whispering his name. Just \u201cWei Ying\u201d over and over, in a loop that plays for fifty-eight minutes. \nWei Wuxian buries his head in his pillow, and screams. \n\u2014\n\u201cA-jie,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, the next morning, throwing himself onto her bed. \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d\nJiang Yanli turns around from where she\u2019s fixing her hair at the vanity to look at him. \u201cOf course you can,\u201d she tells him. \u201cIt sounds serious,\u201d she adds, with a hint of a teasing smile.\n\u201cWhat does it feel like to be in love?\u201d Wei Wuxian blurts out. He\u2019s spent the entire night tossing and turning in bed, thinking about this. He\u2019s felt attraction towards other people before, mostly cushioned in lust, and perhaps not very long-lasting, but this...thing with Lan Wangji seems to Wei Wuxian to be very different. \nIf it were just a fleeting crush, surely he wouldn\u2019t be acting like this; he\u2019s certainly never done this with anyone else before. But...if it\u2019s not a crush, then what is this? \nJiang Yanli smiles, cheeks dimpling. \u201cWould you believe we\u2019ve actually had this conversation before?\u201d she asks. \nWei Wuxian groans, and hides his face in her duvet. He probably asked her the same question in the past for the same reason he\u2019s asking now. \u201cA-jie, this is so embarrassing,\u201d he whines. \n\u201cYou said that last time as well,\u201d Jiang Yanli says, her smile widening. \n\u201cWhat did you tell me then?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks.\nJiang Yanli hums. \u201cThen, you\u2019d only really known Lan Wangji for a couple of months,\u201d she tells him, \u201cso I said to be careful with your heart.\u201d She makes her way towards Wei Wuxian, and sits down on the bed next to him, carding her fingers gently through his hair. \u201cBut I think you took it a little bit too literally, because you went on to not say or do anything about your feelings for him for the next couple of years, so I guess this time I\u2019ll tell you to be brave, and trust that Lan Wangji will be careful with your heart.\u201d\nWei Wuxian feels his cheeks heat. \u201cI asked you that early into my friendship with Lan Wangji?\u201d What is wrong with him? \u201cI already felt...things for him a couple of months in?\u201d\n\u201cOh, A-Xian, if you could remember the way you both look at each other, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised,\u201d Jiang Yanli says. \n\u201cWhat is it about him, a-jie? Why him?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, pouting. \nJiang Yanli smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s really a question I think only you can answer,\u201d she says. \u201cBut for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ve told you before that we can\u2019t help who our heart decides to beat for.\u201d \nWei Wuxian thinks on Jiang Yanli\u2019s words. \u201cDo you think he will be upset that I don\u2019t remember?\u201d he asks quietly. \nIf Lan Wangji is as important to Wei Wuxian\u2019s life as the evidence around him seems to show\u2026 Lan Wangji would be devastated, Wei Wuxian thinks. Wei Wuxian fancies that he would be, too, if the situation were reversed, and if well, Wei Wuxian could actually remember him? \n\u201cHe would be worried,\u201d Jiang Yanli corrects. \n\u201cA little upset,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \nJiang Yanli smiles. \u201cYeah, okay, a little upset, too,\u201d she concedes. \n\u2014\nWei Wuxian gets by dodging Lan Wangji\u2019s calls for close to four days with relative ease. Jiang Cheng had told him while Wei Wuxian was in the hospital that there was a project that Wei Wuxian was working urgently on that would take up the bulk of his time. Lan Wangji has been considerate of this, and only rings once every night, and doesn\u2019t call back if Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t answer. \nHe does text to check in on Wei Wuxian, and Wei Wuxian does reply to those, manages to throw in some of his patented flirting as well, which seems to keep Lan Wangji at bay.\nLan Wangji is scheduled to come back in another six days \u2014 Wei Wuxian had planned to just postpone having to tell Lan Wangji that he\u2019s lost all memories of Lan Wangji until he\u2019s not able to ignore it anymore. \nNo point in making Lan Wangji worry, right?\n(And more importantly, no point in having to worry over how to break the news to Lan Wangji until Lan Wangji actually shows up knocking at his door, right?)\nBut because misfortune apparently never comes knocking alone, Wei Wuxian\u2019s plan to ignore things until they cannot be ignored anymore is foiled when he answers his phone just as he has come out of the shower.\n\u201cWei Ying?\u201d Lan Wangji says.\nWei Wuxian starts. He would recognise this voice saying these exact words anywhere; he\u2019s listened to the 58 minute loop of Lan Wangji saying his name enough times to do so. \u201cLan- Lan Zhan?\u201d \n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cWei Ying, you have not called in several days.\u201d\nHe has a very nice voice \u2014 deep and soft. Wei Wuxian finds it calming, and he finds the concern he can hear bleeding through Lan Wangji\u2019s voice strangely endearing. \n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says again. It\u2019s ridiculous that the name feels so familiar, when Wei Wuxian has no memory of the man himself. He swallows. \u201cLan er-gege,\u201d he tries, and oh, that feels familiar too. \n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji answers. And then, almost tentatively, he asks, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\nWei Wuxian could just tell him. He could just tell him now over the phone to get it over and done with. Lan Wangji has been his friend and they\u2019ve apparently had this Not-Relationship thing going on for years. He doesn\u2019t think that a little bit of memory loss is going to send Lan Wangji running. Or, well, if it does, then that doesn\u2019t really make much of a difference to Wei Wuxian too, right? He shouldn\u2019t really feel so on-edge just thinking about breaking the news to Lan Wangji.\nBut he is. And\u2026 \nAnd surely this is the sort of news that he shouldn\u2019t break to Lan Wangji over the phone. Lan Wangji is alone in Moling, and if he\u2019s as into Wei Wuxian as Wei Wuxian thinks the past him was into Lan Wangji, then the news will hit him hard. It\u2019s surely better to wait until he\u2019s back home, when Wei Wuxian knows at the very least that Lan Wangji can go to Lan Xichen if he needs emotional support.\nMind made up, he says, instead, \u201cI just miss you.\u201d \nLan Wangji is quiet for a long moment, and Wei Wuxian tries his best not to freak out about it. Is this not something that he would say, if he were in possession of all his memories? He does it frequently enough over texts that he hadn\u2019t thought that it would be a red flag, but Lan Wangji is just quiet over the line, and it makes Wei Wuxian anxious- \n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, voice thick with an emotion that Wei Wuxian thinks he would be able to name, if he\u2019s made to. \nHe steers himself resolutely away from that thought, and tries to lighten the mood. \u201cAre you missing me as well, Lan er-gege? I bet Moling isn\u2019t fun without me there!\u201d \n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees. \n\u201cWhich question are you agreeing to, gege?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. \n\u201cBoth,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him. \u201cMiss you. Moling is dull without you here.\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s chest tightens. \u201cTell me about the conference,\u201d he says.\nIf Lan Wangji notices that Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice shakes, he makes no mention of it.\n\u2014\nHe starts picking up Lan Wangji\u2019s calls after that, alongside an increase in the exchange of text messages where the kissy face emojis start to come to him a lot more easily.\nIt\u2019s not as difficult as he thought it would be, talking to Lan Wangji, even if he is working off on very scattered information about Lan Wangji that he learns through reading their old texts and listening to Jiang Cheng make fun of the way he is with Lan Wangji. His memory has never been very good anyway, and Lan Wangji excuses the many occasions where Wei Wuxian goes \u2018Huh?\u2019 when Lan Wangji makes a reference to some events in the past. \nHe neatly side-steps all the questions Lan Wangji has about Wei Wuxian\u2019s work, mostly by groaning loudly, and saying, \u201cLan Zhan, if I have to even think about this project for one more second, I\u2019ll surely die! You wouldn\u2019t want that, would you? No? Then let\u2019s talk about something else! Like, oh, did I tell you about the mapo tofu that I had for lunch earlier today?\u201d \nLan Wangji takes it all in stride, and with grace. He listens to Wei Wuxian ramble nonsense, answers Wei Wuxian\u2019s inane questions about whether his best feature is his eyes or mouth- \n(\u201cMouth,\u201d Lan Wangji says, too quickly. Wei Wuxian flushes to his roots thinking about his mouth and then of Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth before Lan Wangji catches himself, and says, \u201cYou have a nice smile.\u201d\nEven that makes Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips tingle.)\n-and lets Wei Wuxian bully him into telling him all about his conference in great detail, even though Lan Wangji professes that Wei Wuxian will find his recount boring. Lan Wangji sends him shaky selfies when Wei Wuxian asks for them, and admits to saving the selfies Wei Wuxian sends him in return because he misses Wei Wuxian when he\u2019s asked. \nWei Wuxian is not going to lie. He sees the appeal of being in love with Lan Wangji now, he really, really does. Lan Wangji makes him feel...warm and special and cherished. It\u2019s a good feeling, a really wonderful feeling, even if there is the underlying guilt of enjoying Lan Wangji\u2019s attention when Lan Wangji isn\u2019t fully aware of the situation with Wei Wuxian\u2019s lost memories. \nIf this is how he used to feel all the time with Lan Wangji, no wonder he went and fell in love with the guy!\nWei Wuxian really wishes he had his memories back, even if it\u2019s just so he can solve this riddle: \nAll signs point to Wei Wuxian having an embarrassingly obvious crush on Lan Wangji, and of Lan Wangji very possibly liking him back. If this is true, if things are the way Wei Wuxian understands them to be, just from his casual observations over the last couple of days, then why the hell aren\u2019t they together? \n\u2014\n\u201cLan Zhan?\u201d \n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and the strange knot in Wei Wuxian\u2019s chest eases. \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t be able to talk tonight because you were going out with Jiang Wanyin and Nie Huaisang.\u201d\n\u201cI am still out,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him, without thinking, and immediately wishes he hasn\u2019t. Even if they have been speaking a lot, it\u2019s probably weird that Wei Wuxian calls him so much, right? Lan Wangji must be tired of having to speak to Wei Wuxian so much. Wei Wuxian swallows the embarrassment that\u2019s threatening to spill out of him, and confesses, \u201cI just thought it felt weird not to wish you goodnight.\u201d\nLan Wangji is quiet on the other end of the phone.\nWei Wuxian cringes. It\u2019s probably weird that he finds so much comfort in speaking to Lan Wangji, and probably deceitful that he\u2019s doing it without Lan Wangji knowing about his amnesia. \u201cGoodnight,\u201d he whispers, miserable. \n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, before Wei Wuxian is able to hang up. \n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you called,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him. \u201cIt did feel weird not hearing you wish me goodnight.\u201d\nWei Wuxian feels his lips spread into a smile. He feels lighter now. \u201cGoodnight, er-gege,\u201d he says again. \u201cSleep well.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I will, now that you\u2019ve called,\u201d Lan Wangji says softly.\nThe warmth in Wei Wuxian\u2019s chest doesn\u2019t dissipate the entire night. \n\u2014\n\nFrom: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nFlight_Itinerary.pdf\n\nFrom: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nYou will still come to pick me up from the airport?\nWei Wuxian sits on the texts for a good hour. \nShould he go and pick Lan Wangji up from the airport? What if Lan Wangji notices something is up the moment he sees Wei Wuxian? Wouldn\u2019t that make the drive back to Lan Wangji\u2019s apartment awkward? \nMaybe he should just tell Lan Wangji to have Lan Xichen pick him up. Surely Lan Xichen would be happy to pick his brother up from the airport. \nWei Wuxian types out a stupid excuse, gets midway through the lie, and then deletes the text. \nHe thinks about the quiet comfort Lan Wangji has been giving him through the last few days, and imagines that his presence at the airport would give Lan Wangji the same comfort. He tries his best not to wonder why he wants to be a source of comfort to Lan Wangji; he has only really known of Lan Wangji for a little more than a week, and has really started knowing him for maybe half that time. \nHe hides his face in his pillow, lets out a long groan, and then makes up his mind. \nTo: Er-Gege (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89\u2665*:\uff65\uff9f\u2665\nyes\n\u2014\nLan Wangji is even more beautiful in person, as impossible as it may seem. \n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, the slightest hint of a smile on his face. \n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian breathes out, voice shaking. Coming to pick Lan Wangji up was a bad idea. Wei Wuxian feels like a fraud all of a sudden, now that Lan Wangji is here. He\u2019s not the same person he was when Lan Wangji left. He\u2019s been lying to Lan Wangji for the past few days. He swallows, and tries to smile. If he can just keep it together until they get into the car, at least, maybe they won\u2019t make a scene at the airport. \u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019re back.\u201d \nLan Wangji\u2019s smile widens just a little. \u201cMn,\u201d he hums. He sets his luggage on the ground, then closes the distance between them, and hugs Wei Wuxian. \u201cWei Ying, I\u2019m back.\u201d\nWei Wuxian hugs him back tightly. In the same way that Lan Wangji\u2019s voice was oddly comforting to him despite his lost memories, Lan Wangji\u2019s embrace feels familiar, and he smells right. \n\u201cI think\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian says wobbly. \u201cI think I\u2019ve missed you, Lan Zhan.\u201d \nIt\u2019s probably not a lie. Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t even really know him, but he thinks he\u2019s missed having Lan Wangji around.\nLan Wangji\u2019s arms tighten minutely. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you too, Wei Ying,\u201d he says softly, before letting Wei Wuxian go. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be back.\u201d\nWei Wuxian smiles. \u201cTell me about your trip,\u201d he says, and swats Lan Wangji\u2019s hand away when Lan Wangji tries to pick up his luggage, picking Lan Wangji\u2019s bags up for him instead. \u201cWas the flight terrible? Was there a crying baby?\u201d \nLan Wangji huffs out a soft laugh. \u201cThe flight was uneventful,\u201d he tells Wei Wuxian. \u201cTwo flight attendants tried to give me their numbers.\u201d \n\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says dumbly. Lan Wangji is a very attractive man. It probably happens a lot. Wei Wuxian probably shouldn\u2019t sound so startled. \u201cThat\u2019s- That\u2019s good.\u201d \nLan Wangji gives him an odd look. \u201cWei Ying?\u201d \nWei Wuxian flashes him a sunny smile. \u201cWhat about the food on your flight?\u201d he asks, desperate to change the subject, and Lan Wangji, blessedly, lets him. \nThe drive back goes by in comfortable silence that is occasionally broken by the GPS giving directions to Lan Wangji\u2019s apartment. \nWei Wuxian is acutely aware of Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes on him for most of the drive. Lan Wangji must know something is up, had probably known from the moment Wei Wuxian reacted to his comment about the flight attendants wrongly. If Lan Wangji just asks him, Wei Wuxian swears he will tell Lan Wangji everything. Lying to Lan Wangji feels terrible.\nBut Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t ask, not during the drive, and not during the walk up to his apartment. He doesn\u2019t say anything about it, until Wei Wuxian is sitting on his very nice couch, and Lan Wangji has pressed a mug of tea into Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Wei Ying?\u201d Lan Wangji asks. \nWei Wuxian looks down at his mug of tea, his earlier bravado leaving him all in a rush. \n\u201cI gave you the opening to make your usual joke about the flight attendants giving me their number, and you didn\u2019t take it,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cYou needed the GPS to guide you back to my apartment. You haven\u2019t asked about bengbeng and tiaotiao yet-\u201d\nThat startles Wei Wuxian into looking up at Lan Wangji again. \u201cBengbeng and tiaotiao?\u201d he asks.\nLan Wangji\u2019s frown deepens. \u201cWei Ying, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks, concern seeping out from his every pore.\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian sets his mug down on the coffee table. \u201cLan Zhan, you should probably sit down for this?\u201d \nLan Wangji does as Wei Wuxian says, settling down next to Wei Wuxian on the couch. He reaches out to grip Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand. \u201cWei Ying?\u201d \n\u201cI had a bit of an accident, while you were away,\u201d Wei Wuxian admits quietly.\nLan Wangji\u2019s grip tightens, but he doesn\u2019t interrupt Wei Wuxian, which Wei Wuxian is infinitely grateful for. He\u2019s got to do this all in one shot, or he will probably lose his nerve, and try to run away.\n\u201cWhen I woke up in the hospital, I was, uh, missing some memories,\u201d Wei Wuxian continues. \nLan Wangji makes a soft, startled noise. \n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers. He keeps his gaze away from Lan Wangji. He\u2019s not sure he can say the words, if Lan Wangji is looking at him. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you, Lan Zhan.\u201d \n\u201cAt all?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, shaky. \n\u201cI woke up thinking it was 2014,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him. \u201cI didn\u2019t meet you until-\u201d It\u2019s as he\u2019s saying it that he realises that he doesn\u2019t even really know when he met Lan Wangji. \n\u201cEarly-2015,\u201d Lan Wangji says. He lets go of Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand. His fingers are trembling slightly. \nLan Wangji looks devastated at the news, and Wei Wuxian spares a bare moment to think to himself that they were right to wait until Lan Wangji was back to break this news to him. He would\u2019ve been a wreck back in Moling. \n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says gently. \u201cLan Zhan, it\u2019s not that bad, I swear. Xichen-ge says I might get some memories back with time. I\u2019ll probably beat all odds and remember everything. It probably won\u2019t take me long before I remember everything. You know how I like to attempt the impossible!\u201d\nLan Wangji is quiet for a long moment. When he speaks again, it\u2019s a heartbreaking exhale of, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me.\u201d \nWei Wuxian\u2019s heart aches at the look on Lan Wangji\u2019s face. Before he can talk himself out of it, he\u2019s got his arms around Lan Wangji, hugging him tightly. \n\u201cI don\u2019t remember you,\u201d he tells Lan Wangji, not unkindly, but Lan Wangji shakes in his arms all the same. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know you. I\u2019ve been reading our old texts, and I\u2019ve been getting to know you again the last couple of days. I\u2019ve been doing my best to learn about you, about our friendship. Lan Zhan, you were really important to me, before, and I still want you to be, now.\u201d \nLan Wangji\u2019s arms come up slowly to hold Wei Wuxian back, just as tightly as Wei Wuxian is holding him. \n\u201cI still want to be your best friend, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. A thought comes to him, unbidden. \u201cUnless you\u2019d rather not be my friend, now that I don\u2019t remember-\u201d\nLan Wangji pulls away at that. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, so fiercely that Wei Wuxian wonders why he ever had a single doubt. \u201cI\u2019ll be here with you no matter what.\u201d \nWei Wuxian\u2019s heart skips a beat at the words, relieved. He smiles at Lan Wangji, and then says, \u201cWill you tell me about bengbeng and tiaotiao now?\u201d \nLan Wangji\u2019s lips curve softly. \n\u2014\nThe rabbits he has as his laptop wallpaper. \nThat\u2019s who bengbeng and tiaotiao are. \nWei Wuxian really is a fucking fool in love. \n\u2014\nWei Wuxian expects it to be awkward with Lan Wangji, after the truth comes out, but it isn\u2019t.\nOr, rather, Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian both resolutely do not allow it to be. \nThey resume the usual (mostly low-key flirty) texting, and keep up with the daily phone calls. Lan Wangji also takes it upon himself to show up at Wei Wuxian\u2019s house to take him out for meals. \n\u201cYour favourite places,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to all of them.\u201d \nWei Wuxian grins widely. \u201cOkay!\u201d he agrees happily. Lan Wangji really is the perfect best friend, if he\u2019s out here taking Wei Wuxian to all his favourite restaurants and buying him food. \u201cIf I can\u2019t remember them, at least I can start liking them again!\u201d \nLan Wangji\u2019s gaze goes serious. \u201cYou will like them again, right?\u201d he asks quietly. \nWei Wuxian\u2019s heart thuds loudly. It doesn\u2019t feel like Lan Wangji is asking just about the food anymore, and oh. \n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cThe things I used to like before? There must be a good reason why I liked them. And if I liked them before, why wouldn\u2019t I like them now?\u201d \nLan Wangji swallows. \u201cThe circumstances-\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t matter,\u201d Wei Wuxian interjects. \u201cI\u2019ll still like them.\u201d \nLan Wangji nods. \u201cDo you feel like noodles tonight, or do you want to do Korean barbecue?\u201d \nHe does love a good Korean barbecue, but\u2026 \n\u201cDo I grill the meat, or do you grill it?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, eyes narrowing. \n\u201cYou always say I do it better,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him, and Wei Wuxian perks up. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not true, but I do it anyway because you say so.\u201d\nTrue love is finding someone who is willing to grill meat at Korean barbecues for you. If someone is willing to go through the effort of grilling a perfect piece of meat only to offer it to you first, they must love you. That\u2019s just how it works. \nThis is how Wei Wuxian knows that his siblings (even Jiang Cheng!) love him, and this is how he came to the conclusion that Jin Zixuan was really serious about Jiang Yanli when Jiang Yanli reintroduced Jin Zixuan as her husband (her husband, what the fuck!) to Wei Wuxian over dinner just some weeks ago. \n\u201cSo? Korean barbecue?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, when Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t say anything. \u201cI\u2019ll grill.\u201d \nWei Wuxian smiles. \n\u2014\nBut it\u2019s also not always fun and games; memory loss has some fairly serious consequences. \nSometimes, when Wei Wuxian is with his family, he thinks that they look at him, and wish that he were someone else. Jiang Yanli is quick to reassure him that six years don\u2019t really make much of a difference, and that he\u2019s still the Wei Wuxian that he was before he lost his memories, but despite how much Wei Wuxian wants to believe in that, he knows it\u2019s not realistic to say it\u2019s true. \nSix years is a long time, and a lot of changes can happen to a person in six years. \nFrom what he\u2019s been able to gather, he\u2019s supposed to be more mature, more responsible- \nA better version of himself. \nOf course everyone would want that Wei Wuxian back; Wei Wuxian himself wishes that Wei Wuxian were back. \n\u2014\nThere are a number of things that one cannot learn about a person just from reading old texts, and just hearsay from third parties, because every so often, details get omitted, and experiences get downplayed. \nOne of these things, Wei Wuxian learns, is how comfortable it is to nap on Lan Wangji\u2019s lap. \nEver since their agreement to resume their friendship, and for Lan Wangji to help Wei Wuxian learn more about Lan Wangji, they\u2019ve both thrown themselves quickly back into what Lan Wangji (along with basically everyone else that Wei Wuxian thinks to cross-check with) tells Wei Wuxian is their old routine. This mostly involves Wei Wuxian coming over to Lan Wangji\u2019s apartment \u2014 a lot. \nWei Wuxian should probably think before he dives into this friendship too quickly, but it\u2019s...nice being around Lan Wangji, even if sometimes all they do is to just work on their own things quietly. \nThere\u2019s a strange sort of comfort that comes from the way that Lan Wangji will just pass him a mug of tea when Wei Wuxian feels a headache coming on, or in the way Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t even have to ask what Wei Wuxian wants for lunch before he prepares exactly that, or- \nOr just in that way Wei Wuxian catches Lan Wangji looking at him wordlessly sometimes. \nIt\u2019s nice. All of it. Wei Wuxian likes it. He likes it a little too much, perhaps, for someone who\u2019s really only known Lan Wangji for a month at most. \nAs if on cue, Lan Wangji withdraws his fingers from Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair, and rubs a thumb gently between Wei Wuxian\u2019s brows instead. \u201cYou\u2019re frowning,\u201d he murmurs. \n\u201cLan Zhan, do you think I\u2019ll ever get my memories back?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, because he has been thinking about this a lot lately. \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t,\u201d Lan Wangji says easily.\n\u201cWhat will I do if I can\u2019t ever remember?\u201d Wei Wuxian says with a sigh. \u201cWhat will you do, if I don\u2019t ever remember our past together?\u201d \nIt\u2019s Lan Wangji who is frowning now. \u201cThen I\u2019ll make new memories with you,\u201d he tells Wei Wuxian, so sincerely that Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart rabbits in his chest. \u201cWe already are doing that.\u201d\nWei Wuxian swallows. \u201cYou always know what to say,\u201d he murmurs. He pulls himself up, and shifts to face Lan Wangji. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says softly, brushing a kiss over Lan Wangji\u2019s cheek. \u201cThank you, Lan Zhan.\u201d\nLan Wangji blinks at him once, twice, and then he pulls Wei Wuxian into his arms. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me, Wei Ying. Not for anything, and especially not for this.\u201d \nWei Wuxian feels his lip wobble, and then, embarrassingly, he starts to tear up. \nIt\u2019s been...difficult, trying to pretend that everything is fine. It\u2019s not. \nWei Wuxian has a blank space in his mind where six years worth of memories should be! He has six years worth of work to catch up to, and six years worth of memories to relearn from an outsider\u2019s point of view! Jiang Cheng got annoyed at him for touching a comb on his desk the other day, and Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t even know why! Jiang Yanli has apparently married Jin Zixuan now, when the fuck did that happen, and how did he and Jiang Cheng let that happen? Wei Wuxian himself has apparently gone and fallen in love with someone, and he doesn\u2019t even know why he hasn\u2019t done anything about it!\nEverything is a mess, and every day feels so hard, but Wei Wuxian has to smile and pretend that the amnesia doesn\u2019t bother him. He has to do it, otherwise his family will worry over him. Jiang Yanli is already cautious around him as it is; if she knew how he really felt about his amnesia, no doubt she\u2019ll be crying over it all the time.\nHe hides his face in the crook of Lan Wangji\u2019s neck, and for the first time in weeks, lets himself go, and just cries a little bit. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, Lan Zhan,\u201d he chokes out. \u201cEverything is hard. People greet me on the street like we\u2019re old friends, but I can\u2019t recognise them. I look back at old projects I\u2019ve done, and I don\u2019t understand them. You\u2019re so nice to me all the time, and I don\u2019t- I don\u2019t even remember you. I\u2019m trying so hard to remember, but it hurts when I try, and I\u2019m just\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s arms tighten around Wei Wuxian. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he whispers. It\u2019s the most emotional that Wei Wuxian has heard Lan Wangji in the short time he\u2019s known him. \u201cWei Ying, you don\u2019t have to apologise to me for anything too, especially not for this.\u201d\nWei Wuxian clutches at him. \u201cBut I-\u201d \n\u201cWei Ying, let me help you?\u201d Lan Wangji asks softly. \n\u201cPlease,\u201d Wei Wuxian breathes out. \u201cPlease. Yes, please.\u201d \n\u2014\n\u201cJiang Cheng says we ran into each other,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \nLan Wangji smiles, just slightly. \u201cNot very accurate,\u201d he tells Wei Wuxian. \u201cYou ran into me, knocked the both of us over, broke the two bottles of tianzixiao you were holding, and ruined the papers I was carrying.\u201d\nWei Wuxian blinks at him. \u201cAnd you still became my friend?\u201d \n\u201cThat came after,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him. \u201cYou were very annoying in the beginning.\u201d\nWei Wuxian lets out an affronted gasp. \u201cHow do I know that you\u2019re not lying to me?\u201d he asks, eyes narrowed. \u201cFor all I know, you could be taking advantage of my amnesia to slander my good name!\u201d \n\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cLying is forbidden.\u201d\nWei Wuxian smiles. And then, \u201cYou thought I was annoying at first?\u201d \n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says.\nThere is a twinge of something in his chest. Doubt, perhaps. Or, fear, more likely. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m annoying now?\u201d he asks quietly. \n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says softly. \n\u201cSorry,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cIt\u2019s just- I don\u2019t remember what annoys you, so I don\u2019t know how to avoid doing it. If you tell me, I promise I will-\u201d\n\u201cNothing you do annoys me,\u201d Lan Wangji says firmly. \u201cI like everything about you. Then and now.\u201d\nWei Wuxian feels his cheeks heat. \u201cReally? You\u2019re not just saying that about the old me?\u201d \nLan Wangji nods. His ears are bright red, which helps Wei Wuxian to believe that he\u2019s telling the truth. \n\u201cLan Zhan, I like everything about you as well,\u201d Wei Wuxian says decisively. \n\u201cI know,\u201d Lan Wangji says easily. \n\u201cDo you?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. \n\u201cYou used to say it often,\u201d Lan Wangji admits. \n\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He really was in love with Lan Wangji, huh? \u201cGood! I\u2019ll say it often now, too.\u201d \n\u2014\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cWei Ying, that\u2019s enough, you need to rest.\u201d\nWei Wuxian makes a soft noise of protest. Back in 2014, he was just a fresh graduate scrabbling to find a job. 2020 him is a senior mechanical engineer leading projects that 2014 him cannot yet grasp. He\u2019s already behind enough as it is; he doesn\u2019t have time to rest. \n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says again. \u201cWei Ying, stop.\u201d\nWei Wuxian doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the firmness in Lan Wangji\u2019s voice, or Lan Wangji\u2019s hand clasping Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder, but he finally tears his eyes away from his laptop to face Lan Wangji. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says, sighing. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to have to quit my job,\u201d he decides. \nHis employer has been understanding of the whole situation, going so far as to agreeing to Wei Wuxian taking three months off work on unpaid leave, but in all honesty, if Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t gain the bulk of his work-related memories back, he won\u2019t be able to do his job at all. Six years of experience means a lot. \nLan Wangji purses his lips. \u201cYou are already making progress,\u201d he points out. \u201cSlowly, Wei Ying. You shouldn\u2019t push yourself too hard.\u201d\nWei Wuxian nods reluctantly.\nLan Wangji squeezes his shoulder lightly. \u201cYou used to be like this as well,\u201d he tells Wei Wuxian. \u201cYou\u2019d start a project, and just throw yourself into it. It drove me up the wall trying to get you to eat and sleep properly.\u201d\nWei Wuxian smiles at that. He likes these small reminders that he\u2019s not so different a person, even without his memories. \u201cI bet you got really good at it, though.\u201d\nLan Wangji nods. \u201cLast year, when you were working on that generator project with Jin Industries? I told you I would go on a hunger strike until you started eating as well.\u201d\nThat startles a laugh out of Wei Wuxian. \u201cDid it work?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Lan Wangji asks. \nIt must have \u2014 Lan Wangji\u2019s wellbeing must have meant more to Wei Wuxian than his own. He would\u2019ve allowed Lan Wangji to manipulate him into having proper meals and observing reasonable bedtimes, just on the promise that Lan Wangji would start starving himself. \n\u201cI think,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, \u201cthat you are too sneaky for your own good sometimes.\u201d \nLan Wangji smiles. \u201cSave your work, and turn your laptop off,\u201d he tells Wei Wuxian. \u201cI\u2019ll take you out for dinner, and tell you about the first time you made us have lunch together.\u201d\n\u201cHow can I make you have lunch with me?\u201d Wei Wuxian grumbles, but dutifully saves his work on his laptop. \u201cIt\u2019s really a two-person activity.\u201d\n\u201cYou sat down on my table, and refused to leave,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cAnd when I tried to leave, you threatened to do a loud monologue in the restaurant about me playing with your feelings.\u201d\n\u201cLies!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, mostly for form\u2019s sake. It does sound like something he would do. \u201cI would never do anything so shameless.\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s lips quirk. \u201cYou do worse things on a daily basis,\u201d he tells Wei Wuxian.\n\u2014\nHe stirs when Lan Wangji sets him on the bed. \n\u201cSleep,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers. \u201cYou\u2019re tired.\u201d\nWei Wuxian blinks groggily at Lan Wangji. He\u2019s still at Lan Wangji\u2019s apartment. This is Lan Wangji\u2019s bedroom. Did Lan Wangji carry him here? He probably shouldn\u2019t fall asleep here. \u201cI\u2019ll go home,\u201d he tells Lan Wangji, and tries to sit up. \nLan Wangji stops him with a hand on his chest.\nWei Wuxian is too tired to stop himself from falling back into Lan Wangji\u2019s bed when Lan Wangji pushes gently. \n\u201cSleep,\u201d Lan Wangji says again. \u201cI\u2019ll take the couch tonight.\u201d\nWei Wuxian makes a noise of dissent. \u201cDid you use to sleep on the couch when I slept over, before?\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s silence is enough of an answer on its own. \u201cThen stay,\u201d Wei Wuxian says around a yawn. \nLan Wangji hesitates, and Wei Wuxian grins sleepily at that. \n\u201cI\u2019m too tired to do anything to you, er-gege,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can trust me to behave.\u201d \n\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Lan Wangji says, but he slides into bed next to Wei Wuxian, so Wei Wuxian figures he\u2019s not that far off the mark. \n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers, after Lan Wangji turns the lamp on his bedside table off. \n\u201cHm?\u201d \n\u201cIt has been hard for you too, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d he says quietly. \nLan Wangji doesn\u2019t say it, but having to deal with Wei Wuxian\u2019s amnesia must be stressful on his part as well. \n\u201cNonsense,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs. \nWei Wuxian feels around for Lan Wangji\u2019s hand, and then threads their fingers together. \u201cIf it gets too hard, promise me you\u2019ll tell me you need a break from me?\u201d \nLan Wangji squeezes his hand. \u201cNonsense,\u201d he says again, firmer this time. \nWei Wuxian brings their joined hands to his chest, and rests them over his heart. \u201cGoodnight, er-gege,\u201d he whispers, because Lan Wangji would not want to hear Wei Wuxian thank him, and Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s allowed to tell Lan Wangji that he loves him. \n\u2014\nIt slips out of him one day. \nIn his defence, he\u2019s a little distracted. \nHe\u2019s definitely got at least a little bit of a crush on Lan Wangji, this much Wei Wuxian already knows, and he already has had some time to get used to the fact, but then Lan Wangji went and brushed a crumb away from the corner of Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips with his thumb, and like half of Wei Wuxian\u2019s brain has to reboot because holy shit.\nThere\u2019s no way Wei Wuxian can let this specimen of a person out of his grasp. \nWhat the fuck was his past self thinking? \n\u201cLan Zhan, are you in love with me?\u201d he blurts out. \nLan Wangji freezes, retracting his hand quickly. \n\u201cI think you are,\u201d Wei Wuxian says in a rush, before he loses his nerve. \u201cAnd I think I was in love with you too, before the accident.\u201d He looks down at his lap. \u201cAnd I think I\u2019m just...curious as to why we aren\u2019t together. Or, well, weren\u2019t together, before.\u201d \nLan Wangji is frighteningly still when Wei Wuxian looks up. \n\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d Lan Wangji manages to croak out eventually, voice hoarse. \nIt really doesn\u2019t take six years of knowing Lan Wangji to be able to read the- Christ, the longing in his eyes right now. \n\u201cWell, for one,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers, \u201cyou\u2019re looking at me like that.\u201d \n\u201cNo. Not that,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cWhy would you think that you were also in love with me?\u201d\nAlso in love with him. \nAs in\u2026 Lan Wangji isn\u2019t denying that he\u2019s in love with Wei Wuxian. \nWei Wuxian\u2019s throat runs dry. His heart beats at a treacherously embarrassing pace. \nHe\u2019d known that there was a very good chance that Lan Wangji would say yes, but he just didn\u2019t think the admission would come so easily. Or that he would be so affected by it.\nLan Wangji is still looking at him, hesitantly hopeful, and it\u2019s suddenly important that Wei Wuxian picks his words right. \n\u201cBecause it\u2019s obvious,\u201d he tells Lan Wangji firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t really need a lot of context to tell you that you were the most important person in my life. That I flirted with you because I liked you.\u201d\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t mean it,\u201d Lan Wangji says, swallowing. It helps that he doesn\u2019t sound too convinced. \u201cYou do it with everyone else.\u201d\nWei Wuxian rolls his eyes at that. \u201cLan Zhan, I don\u2019t even need my memories to tell you that you\u2019re wrong.\u201d He takes a step closer, tentatively reaching out for one of Lan Wangji\u2019s hands. \u201cIs this why we weren\u2019t together before? Because I never said it?\u201d \nHe wishes he could go back in time to knock himself on the head a little. This is a really silly reason for them not to be together.\nLan Wangji is quiet for a second. \nWei Wuxian lets him think in silence. It\u2019s already a good sign that Lan Wangji hasn\u2019t let go of Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand. This is already further than Wei Wuxian thought that he would get. He\u2019s happy to just hold Lan Wangji\u2019s hand for a bit. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would love me back,\u201d Lan Wangji says. And then, softly, \u201cYou\u2019re right. I am in love with you. I think I have been for a very long time.\u201d\nWei Wuxian beams. It\u2019s impossible not to. \u201cLan Zhan, do you want to go on a date with me?\u201d\nLan Wangji looks alarmed. \u201cWei Ying, do not tease.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not teasing,\u201d Wei Wuxian insists. \u201cLook, I would be taking it too lightly if I told you that I\u2019m in love with you right now. That would be a disservice to you. I\u2019ve only really known you for a couple of weeks, but\u2026 The last couple of weeks have been enough for me to guess why I would be in love with you. I trust my past self\u2019s judgement.\u201d He squeezes Lan Wangji\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m willing to bet if you just give me some time, I\u2019d be head over heels in love with you again. So.\u201d \nHe takes a deep breath. \nThere\u2019s no reason to be nervous, not when he can already guess how Lan Wangji is going to react to a question that is probably a couple of years in the making, but Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart skips anyway. \u201cDo you want to go on a date with me, Lan Zhan?\u201d he asks. \nThe smile that blooms on Lan Wangji\u2019s face is the most beautiful sight that Wei Wuxian has seen. \n\u201cMn.\u201d\n\u2014\n\n[EPILOGUE]\n\nIt\u2019s about three months after they start dating that it happens one Saturday afternoon. \nIt\u2019s a pretty ordinary Saturday afternoon, as far as Saturday afternoons go. Lan Wangji works even though it\u2019s a weekend and he\u2019s supposed to be resting, Wei Wuxian hassles him into taking a break, they end up taking a walk in the park downstairs, hand in hand. \n\u201cOh, look! Ice cream cart!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, when he spots one.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had lunch yet,\u201d Lan Wangji reminds him. \n\u201cThen we\u2019ll just have ice cream for lunch,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him simply, and tugs him along in the direction of the ice cream cart, grinning to himself when Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t resist. \u201cLan Zhan, what flavour do you want? Ah, they\u2019ve got all my favourites!\u201d \n\u201cJust get one,\u201d Lan Wangji warns him. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be going for lunch.\u201d\nWei Wuxian pouts at him. And then, \u201cLet\u2019s each get one?\u201d \nLan Wangji sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll get the raspberry sorbet in a cup, please,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and Wei Wuxian beams at him sunnily. \n\u201cYou\u2019re the best, er-gege!\u201d he says happily. \nIt\u2019s really a perk to date someone who knows him so well! Wei Wuxian was wavering between peppermint and raspberry! But now that Lan Wangji has chosen raspberry, it\u2019s an easy decision. He can\u2019t wait till he knows Lan Wangji as well as Lan Wangji knows him! \n\u201cI\u2019ll have the peppermint on a cone, please,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells the vendor. Only, as he\u2019s saying it, a thought comes to him. \u201cNo, wait, I\u2019ll get the peanut butter instead. My boyfriend is allergic to peppermint,\u201d Wei Wuxian says quickly, and then pays for the ice cream before Lan Wangji can make his move. \nHeh, double score for him today! It\u2019s not often that he manages to beat Lan Wangji to the bill. \nIt isn\u2019t until they\u2019re walking away from the ice cream truck, their ice creams in hand, that it hits Wei Wuxian. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, stunned. He turns to face Lan Wangji, who has a small smile on his face. No doubt he realised earlier than Wei Wuxian. \u201cI remembered something about you!\u201d \n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says. His eyes are shining, and he looks so, so fond that Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart skips several beats in one go. \u201cYou did.\u201d\nWei Wuxian grins at him. \u201cLooks like I\u2019m going to be in love with you again faster than you know it,\u201d he whispers conspiringly to Lan Wangji. \nHis heart feels light, and for the first time in months, he feels like he can manage anything, as long as he tries hard enough. \nThe smile that blooms on Lan Wangji\u2019s face is beautiful, and Wei Wuxian does the only thing that\u2019s reasonable in the circumstances \u2014 he leans in close, and presses a kiss to Lan Wangji\u2019s lips.\nHe mirrors Lan Wangji\u2019s smile when he feels Lan Wangji\u2019s lips stretch into a smile against his lips. \n\u201cA lot faster than you know,\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs, honest. \n\u2018With or without my old memories,\u2019 Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t say, but Lan Wangji must be able to read between the lines, because Lan Wangji tugs him in gently, and kisses him properly."
