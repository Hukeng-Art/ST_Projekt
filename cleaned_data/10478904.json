    "text": "\u201cSumimasen!\u201d someone yelled loudly as the door to the classroom banged open, the man bowing repeatedly to the teacher before looking at the rest of the class with a dazzling grin. Annabeth looked up from where she was reading over the syllabus for the semester and noticed that the rest of the class did the same.\nThe man was tall and lean with piercing blue eyes and a head of silver hair. At first Annabeth thought he had dyed it that color, but upon closer inspection his eyebrows were about the same shade, and either he was super dedicated to making people think silver was his natural hair color, or it was natural. She hoped it was the latter.\nThe teacher waved away his apologies and handed him a syllabus before she continued from where she left off, talking about the late assignment policy. He took a seat next to Annabeth and gave her a smile, showing off his perfect teeth, which was very unfair and made her re-evaluate her conclusion about his hair. If someone had teeth that straight and white, they could definitely have dyed their eyebrows.\n\u201cSince today is just an introduction to the course, we are going to start with an icebreaker,\u201d the teacher said, looking around at her students. Most of them looked dead on account of the class starting at 8:30 in the morning, only Annabeth and Victor seemed to be functioning at more than 50 percent. \u201cTurn to the person sitting next to you and introduce yourself. After about 5 minutes, you are going to introduce your partner to the rest of the class. Understand?\u201d\nThe teacher received acknowledgement from most of the students as they turned to find someone to talk to. Annabeth was just turning toward the man who came in late to ask if he wanted to be partners when she heard the scrape of his desk as he brought it closer to her.\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Victor!\u201d he said with a bright smile on his face, \u201cwhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cAnnabeth,\u201d she said, giving a hesitant smile back, \u201cit\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cSo, Annabeth,\u201d Victor said, tilting his head and placing it on his hand, \u201cwhat brings you to Japanese class?\u201d\n\u201cOh, um,\u201d she started, completely taken aback by the complete attention he had on her, seemingly actually curious about her answer, \u201cMy company just opened up a branch in Tokyo so I may need to travel there for work on occasion. I figured I should learn some of the language in order to get by when I\u2019m there.\u201d\nVictor clapped his hands together in front of himself with a wide smile on his face. \u201cWow, you\u2019re already working for a company? You look so young!\u201d\nAnnabeth blushed a little at the compliment. \u201cI\u2019m 29. I have a 5 year old daughter. She just started Kindergarten.\u201d \nVictor smiled even wider, if that was possible. \u201cI\u2019m also 29! I thought I would be the oldest in class, but I guess we\u2019re tied. We have to become good friends now!\u201d Annabeth nodded without realizing what she was doing. \u201cGood. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been in school. I never went to college, but if you work for a company you must be very smart. We should become study buddies.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you studying Japanese, Victor?\u201d Annabeth asked, ignoring his statement for now. \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a trophy husband,\u201d Victor said with pride, making Annabeth choke a little. He looked so proud of the fact. \u201cOr, I like to think of myself more as a gold medal husband. I think it fits me better,\u201d he said with a small laugh. Annabeth didn\u2019t get the joke but smiled anyway. \u201cMy husband is Japanese and I want to speak with his parents more. They only speak a little English, and it isn\u2019t fair to them to not learn how to communicate. Besides,\u201d he said with a pout, \u201cmy husband has only been learning Russian for a year and he\u2019s better at speaking it than I am at Japanese. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d\nAnnabeth just stared at the pout that was coming from the man and shook her head, amused by his antics. Her own husband was born in America, but his parents were from Brazil and often spoke Portuguese to him growing up. They were mostly fluent in English, but sometimes she found it difficult to speak with them.\n\u201cI understand,\u201d she said, giving him a smile. \u201cWhat does your husband do?\u201d\nShe saw his eyes light up as he gave her a big grin, sitting up straight. \u201cHe\u2019s so smart,\u201d he said dreamily. \u201cHis name\u2019s Yuuri and he\u2019s getting his MA in teaching at the university. He\u2019s also a TA and teaching beginning level Japanese to the undergrads. I wish I could attend his classes, but he told me under no circumstances that I can\u2019t attend, as I would be too distracting.\u201d He pouted again at this and Annabeth noticed that he wore his emotions on his face clearly for everyone to see. She could also tell that he was head over heels in love with his husband. It was adorable.\nThey were called back to attention by the teacher and their classmates went around introducing their partners. Even though it was a community college class, Victor and Annabeth were the oldest by 9 years. Everyone else was a teenager or newly 20, trying to rack up enough credits before attending a university.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you on Thursday!\u201d Victor shouted to Annabeth on the way out, waving goodbye. Annabeth waved back and walked to her car, intending to go to a coffee shop for the remaining hour and a half she had before she needed to pick her daughter up from Kindergarten.\n--\nClass with Victor was interesting. He always came to class with a smile on his face, even though it started early. When asked by one of their classmates, he stated that he has been up since five in the morning, earning a look of disgust from the people that overheard.\n\u201cUgh, why?\u201d one of their classmates asked as he sat with his head on the desk, coffee in hand as they waited for their teacher.\nVictor smiled at him. \u201cI have to get my son to the ice rink by 5:30am for practice, so getting up at five is actually pretty late. He always has to drag me out of bed because if we don\u2019t leave by 5:10 we will be late, and no one wants to deal with him if we cut in on practice time.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a son?\u201d Annabeth asked as their teacher walked in. With how much he talked about his husband, she would have though he would mention his son more.\n\u201cYeah, Yuri,\u201d Victor said, giving her a smile. \u201cI thought I mentioned him? I must have forgot. My memory is really bad.\u201d\n\u201cI thought Yuri was your husband?\u201d Annabeth asked, confused. Victor was always talking about Yuri, talking about how smart he is, praising his beauty, and other mushy nonsense that made the whole class roll their eyes and tune him out. Some of the girls sighed, clearly loving the fact that he loved his husband so much, but most of them were tired of it.\n\u201cYuuri is my husband,\u201d Victor said brightly, \u201cYuri is our small, angry son. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you named your son after your husband?\u201d Annabeth asked, dreading the answer. It was something Victor would probably do, and if so, his poor kid. Actually, poor kid in general.\n\u201cNo, Yuri came with his name already when he came to live with us. But the vowel sound is different between the two. And one of the names is Russian and the other Japanese.\u201d\nAnnabeth shook her head. \u201cYeah, I can\u2019t hear it. You might have talked about your son before but I just assumed it was your husband.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Victor said with a smile.\n--\n\u201cVictor,\u201d the teacher called on next, speaking in Japanese, \u201ctell us about your family.\u201d\nEveryone groaned because they would have to listen to him talk about his husband again but Victor just grinned and jumped out of his seat.\n\u201cI have a beautiful husband named Yuuri,\u201d he said in Japanese. \u201cHe is studying to become a teacher. I also have a son named Yuri. He is a student and a ______,\u201d he said a word that nobody understood. The teacher nodded at him to continue. \u201cMy parents-in-law live in Japan. I have someone like a Grandfather named Yakov who lives in Russia. Also I have a very cute dog named Makkachin. That is my family.\u201d\nEveryone clapped as he sat down and the teacher laughed a little bit.\n\u201cEh? Nani nani?\u201d Victor asked, pouting at the teacher who just shook her head a little. \n\u201cSorry Victor-san,\u201d she said in English. \u201cWhen you are speaking freely like that you have a Kyushu accent. It\u2019s not bad, but it is funny to hear it in my classroom.\u201d\nVictor smiled happily. \u201cThank you very much,\u201d he told the teacher. \u201cI am trying very hard. I want to speak like my parents-in-law, and I first learned Japanese in Kyushu, so\u2026\u201d he trailed off, still smiling. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d the teacher said, still chuckling, \u201cwho\u2019s next?\u201d\n\u201cYou really can make anything into a compliment, can\u2019t you?\u201d Annabeth asked him quietly as the next person started speaking. Victor grinned at her.\n\u201cWhy yes I can, thank you,\u201d Victor said. Annabeth groaned and shook her head, turning back to the front of the room while Victor smirked.\n--\n\u201cHere everyone,\u201d Victor said as he came in to the classroom, thrusting a box of something in front of him. \u201cI made these scones last night. You should try them.\u201d\nThe students already in the classroom shot out of their seats and grabbed a scone, mumbling out their thanks, faces already stuffed with the food.\n\u201cHere, this is for you,\u201d Victor said to Annabeth as he walked to his usual seat, passing her something wrapped in a napkin. \u201cAnd I have something for your daughter here,\u201d he said, passing her a small box. Curious, Annabeth opened it up and gasped at what she saw, a smile coming across her face.\n\u201cVictor, this is so cute. Thank you,\u201d she said, looking at the cat shaped scone with features drawn on it in icing. It was a little lopsided, but she was sure her daughter would squeal when she saw it all the same.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be a better husband,\u201d he said as he placed his own scone on the desk. \u201cMy Yuuri cooks a lot more than he should considering he\u2019s a student full time and a TA, but I\u2019m kind of clueless in the kitchen. But I saw these on a website known as Pinterest. Do you know it?\u201d\nAnnabeth rolled her eyes. She had a daughter in Kindergarten. Of course she knew what Pinterest was.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard,\u201d Victor whined, putting his hands in his cheeks. \u201cBut I knew that Yuri would never eat anything I made unless it was shaped like a cat, or a tiger or something. How do stay at home parents do this kind of thing? I\u2019m a horrible homemaker.\u201d\nAnnabeth sighed, very used to her classmate\u2019s actions at this point. \u201cIt\u2019s really cute, my daughter will love it,\u201d she assured him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure your son appreciates it too.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Victor asked, looking close to tears. \u201cThat\u2019s good to know. I just wanted to make my Yuuri smile when he opened his lunch at work, you know?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd he trusted me in the kitchen by myself yesterday, so I can\u2019t let him down.\u201d\nAnnabeth just gave him a smile and a nod. He really was the perfect husband already. She didn\u2019t know Yuuri, but Victor was always gushing about him and smiling happily when he gazed at his ring. And he tried to ease his husband\u2019s burden by doing the housework, even though it seemed like Victor had never had to take care of anything before and always relied on others.\n\u201cHey, Victor,\u201d she said, just realizing something, \u201cwhat did you do before you married Yuuri? Before you became a \u2018gold medal husband,\u2019\u201d she asked, using his term from the first day of class.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, looking surprised. \u201cI\u2019m actually retired. Right now we\u2019re living off of the money I made in my teens and twenties-\u201d\nThe teacher interrupted the moment by walking in to class, already speaking to the students in Japanese, eyeing everyone who was still trying to eat their scone until they put it away for the remainder of class.\n--\n\u201cAnd he said that he made a whole bunch of money in his teens and twenties but is retired now, what do you think his job was?\u201d Annabeth asked her husband that night as they were cleaning up their dinner. Her daughter was doing her homework at the table while they washed the dishes.\n\u201cA prostitute?\u201d her husband, Daniel, joked. \u201cYou told me he was pretty right? And calls himself a trophy husband?\u201d\n\u201cBe serious,\u201d Annabeth scolded, rolling her eyes at her husband\u2019s antics. \u201cMaybe a model? Maybe he aged out? But he\u2019s still so handsome\u2026\u201d she trailed off, humming slightly to herself.\n\u201cDo I need to be jealous?\u201d Daniel asked, raising an eyebrow, yelping when she smacked him in the arm.\n\u201cShut up, you know he\u2019s completely in love with his husband. He is always talking about him, and it would be cute if he ever shut up long enough for us to say \u2018aww.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIf you like him,\u201d Daniel said, \u201cinvite him and his husband over for dinner. And their son. He can play with Gloria while we get to know each other better.\u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t a bad idea. Annabeth didn\u2019t have many friends in the area as she moved here when her husband got a job, worked at home, and had a young daughter. She genuinely liked Victor, and he seemed to enjoy her company in class. But would he want to come over for dinner?\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask next time I see him,\u201d she said, already planning a menu in her head.\n--\nVictor wasn\u2019t in class on Thursday, which was also, coincidentally, when they got assigned a partner project.\n\u201cI\u2019ll pair up with Victor,\u201d Annabeth suggested to the teacher when she came around with copies of the assignment. She nodded.\n\u201cHe told me after class on Tuesday that he wouldn\u2019t be here. When I informed him we would be starting group projects, he told me he would work with you.\u201d\nAnnabeth smiled at that.\nVictor was back in class on Tuesday and waved at her excitedly from his seat.\n\u201cSo I heard we\u2019re partners,\u201d Victor said when she came to sit down. \u201cWhen do you want to get together? Would after class work for you?\u201d\n\u201cI have to pick my daughter up at noon from Kindergarten, but we could work on it after that sometime this week?\u201d Annabeth asked, noticing the happy nod from Victor. Then she remembered what she wanted to ask. \u201cActually, your whole family could come to dinner one night? Maybe meet us once we\u2019re done with the project?\u201d\nFor once, Victor\u2019s grin dropped as he scratched at his chin. Annabeth also dropped her grin, feeling unsure of herself. Did he not want to eat dinner together?\n\u201cSorry, but nights aren\u2019t a good time to see us all together. One of us has to be with Yuri when he\u2019s practicing at the rink, so\u2026\u201d he trailed off, looking unsure of himself. \u201cBut if the offer is open, I could still have dinner?\u201d he asked hesitantly. Relief spread through Annabeth.\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s perfectly okay. Thursday after class?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n--\n\u201cRemember, Gloria,\u201d Annabeth said, looking into the back seat where her daughter sat, looking through a book, \u201cI have a friend coming over to do some work for school.\u201d\nHer cool daughter just shrugged and looked out the window. \u201cI remember, Mom.\u201d Apparently the stop listening to their parents at a young age.\n\u201cWoah,\u201d she heard her daughter say as she pulled onto their street. \u201cWhy is there a prince in front of our house?\u201d\nAnnabeth followed her daughter\u2019s gaze and saw Victor leaning against the railing of the porch, smiling at something on his phone. His silver hair was blowing gently in the wind, really making him look like a prince.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my friend Victor, honey,\u201d she replied as she pulled in front of their house. Gloria was out of her seat and on the front lawn before Annabeth had even unbuckled her seatbelt.\n\u201cAre you a prince?\u201d Gloria was asking by the time Annabeth made her way up the stairs.\nVictor chuckled and crouched down so that he was even with her and gave her a large smile, eyes crinkling slightly. The small wrinkles at the corner of his eyes made him look more human.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Victor said, staring at her daughter in a kind way. \u201cAre you a princess?\u201d\nGloria just giggled and shook her head. Victor pouted.\n\u201cOh, I really thought you were. You\u2019re so pretty,\u201d he told her, making her giggle again, blushing as she stared down at her toes.\nWhen Victor spotted Annabeth watching them he widened his eyes before mouthing \u2018she\u2019s so cute.\u2019 Annabeth smiled, proud of her family.\nThey worked for four hours on their project while Gloria colored at the table next to them. She would occasionally talk to Victor, but he never seemed bothered by the random questions, always answering them with patience.\nHe was a hard and dedicated worker when it came to his own work, and he pushed Annabeth to do the same. Once he was focused on something, it was like he was a completely different person. It made Annabeth wonder why he never went to college, if he seemed to enjoy the work and he was good at it.\nThey finished about an hour before her family usually ate dinner, and Victor insisted on helping her cook. While he was serious when working on school things, he was unbelievably silly when cooking. Even Gloria laughed at him as he made a mess of things, mumbling under his breath in Russian.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mess in here,\u201d Daniel said when he came home, kissing Gloria on the top of the head when she ran over to hug his legs before going over to his wife and hugging her. Annabeth just laughed.\n\u201cYes, sorry,\u201d Victor said as he waved around a spatula, looking especially silly in a cat patterned apron. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s all my fault. When I cook, somehow the kitchen becomes a war zone. I don\u2019t even remember using half of these dishes.\u201d\n\u201cYou must be Victor,\u201d Daniel said, waving from where he stood. Victor grinned at him and waved the spatula again before panicking when the timer went off.\n\u201cWhat should I do, what should I do?\u201d he mumbled, staring at the oven. \nGloria giggled from where she was watching the proceedings and got up, walking to where Victor stood.\n\u201cSilly Victor, you need to take the chicken out.\u201d\nVictor turned to her and brought a hand to his forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re right, princess Gloria. I remember now. Now move away so you don\u2019t get hurt.\u201d\nDaniel and Annabeth stood, just watching what was happening, alarmed when Victor almost reached in to grab the pan without putting on oven mitts. The whole world seemed a lot safer when the chicken was finally on their plates, along with the vegetables Annabeth was in charge of making.\n\u201cHave you ever been ice skating?\u201d Victor asked Gloria when they had sat down to eat.\nShe shook her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nVictor gasped and put a hand to his chest in shock before leaning toward her with a frown. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the best sport in the universe? How\u2026 I know,\u201d he turned toward Daniel and Annabeth, \u201cit\u2019s all your parents\u2019 fault they\u2019ve never taken you.\u201d\n\u201cBut what is it?\u201d Gloria asked, looking at her parents as well.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell her,\u201d Victor said, holding out a hand when Annabeth had opened her mouth to explain. She shut it, looking confused at the man in front of her. \u201cIt\u2019s much better to show her, so she\u2019s surprised. There\u2019s actually an ice show next week at the local rink. Yuri will be performing, along with a lot of students of all ages who practice there. Do you three want tickets? It\u2019ll be something fun you can do together as a family.\u201d\nThey shared a glance before Daniel smiled. \u201cThanks, Victor. That would be nice.\u201d\n--\nA week later found their small family on the cold bleachers of an ice rink, Gloria bouncing out of her seat. She still didn\u2019t know what ice skating was, but when she saw the ice she started jumping up and down between her parents.\n\u201cHow do you spell Yuri?\u201d Gloria asked, looking through the program before the show started. \u201cI want to find out when Victor\u2019s son is performing so we can cheer extra loudly.\u201d\nAnnabeth spelled it and watched as her daughter used her new reading ability to find his name. \u201cHe\u2019s in the first number with a whole bunch of other people, and then after the in-ter-miss\u2019in,\u201d she sounded out, \u201che performs by himself. Is he a good skater?\u201d she asked her mom.\nAnnabeth shrugged. \u201cIf he has a solo, he must be pretty good.\u201d\nWhen the lights went out and spotlights started circling around the rink, Gloria became very excited, squirming from where she was between her parents. Finally, a large group of people skated out and started performing to a pop song Annabeth couldn\u2019t remember the name of. She heard Gloria\u2019s gasp of delight and smiled at her husband, glad Victor suggested the show.\nShe could tell some of the skaters were better than others by the way they moved, graceful and effortless on the ice. It was more of a synchronized skating performance than anything she had seen before, with a lot of passes. There was also a pinwheel thrown in there, which made Gloria clasp her mom\u2019s hand in happiness as she gazed at the skaters moving about the ice. \nBy the end of the song, Annabeth still didn\u2019t know which one was Yuri, but was absolutely ecstatic to be seeing the show.\nAs it went on, groups of all different ages and abilities performed. The toddlers waddling out onto the ice were so cute and Annabeth just sighed, missing when Gloria was that age. Some of the skaters were very good, and the first time Gloria saw someone jump in the air for what looked like a double, she cried out in happiness.\n\u201cDid you see that?\u201d she asked her mom, eyes shining in delight. \u201cDad did you see that? She just flew into the air. Wow.\u201d\nThere was a small intermission when the Zamboni came out to resurface the ice and Gloria was even happy to see the machine, gaping when the ice became like new again.\n\u201cHey dad, can I buy a rose to give to Yuri after the show?\u201d\n\u201cSure, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nWhen they made it back, the lights started to dim, but the energy was different. Many of the people in the stands were murmuring amongst themselves. They spotted a figure skate out in the dark, settling on the ice. Annabeth looked around, bewildered, when so many people in the stands started yelling Yuri\u2019s name, along with what sounded like \u201cdavai.\u201d\n\u201cHe must be good,\u201d Gloria whispered to her parents, leaning forward in her seat.\nFrom the very first moment of the skate, Annabeth could tell that Yuri was on another level. The emotions he exuded while skating were present from the first note, and he quickly went into a spiral sequence, startling them with his flexibility.\n\u201cHe\u2019s so pretty,\u201d Gloria said to herself as she saw the light reflect off of his braided hair, his foot raised behind his head. He was wearing a black costume with red and purple spreading out from his chest and a thousand rhinestones glittering across the whole outfit. He looked like a prince.\nYuri went into a spin, flying through the air and coming down in a sitting position, rotating quickly before transitioning, grabbing his blade and pulling his leg behind his head, back arched gracefully.\nThe first jump he did was met with screams and shouting from the audience. When he landed, Annabeth gripped her husband\u2019s shoulder and they exchanged looks, startled at what they just saw.\nThey were still shocked through the rest of the performance, only stopping to stand and clap when he finished, kneeling on the ice with his hand reaching out toward the audience. He spent a little more time on the ice than the other performers did, waving at his fans before skating off behind the curtain.\n\u201cMom,\u201d Gloria said, still standing, \u201cI want to do that.\u201d\n\u2018Holy shit,\u2019 Daniel mouthed at her while the next group came out to perform. \u201cDid you know?\u201d he asked his wife, but she just shook her head.\n\u201cI had no idea,\u201d\nThey enjoyed the rest of the numbers, but it was clear no one was as good as Yuri. When the show was coming close to finishing, another skater came out that caused a stir.\n\u201cYuuri,\u201d some fans shouted again, making Annabeth look closer at the skater, noting the black hair. Her stomach clenched as she realized who that was.\n\u201cIs Yuri performing again, mom?\u201d Gloria asked, squinting in the darkness.\nAnnabeth gave a small, hysterical laugh, causing Daniel to look over. \u201cNo, honey, no. That\u2019s Victor\u2019s husband.\u201d \nHe was wearing a blue outfit, looking every bit a prince as he started skating, head rolling backwards as he moved his arm to caress it, making Annabeth\u2019s breath catch. Soon, a man started singing in Italian, the singer\u2019s deep voice reverberating through the rink. Annabeth could have sworn that someone behind her started crying as Yuuri knelt down on one knee.\nHe did two beautiful jumps and when he did a third, the whole stadium seemed to cry out as one when someone skated out on the ice clad in pink, a copy of the costume Yuuri was wearing. As the lights shined on his silver hair, Annabeth gasped and put a hand to her mouth.\n\u201cVictor,\u201d Gloria whispered, not taking her eyes off of the ice.\nWhat followed was the most romantic thing Annabeth had ever seen, and by the end of it, when they struck their final pose, she had tears in her eyes, she looked over at Daniel and found the same thing to be true with him.\nAnd\u2026 it made sense when she thought about it, that enigmatic Victor was a figure skater. The more she thought about it, the more it seemed to fit. Victor was absolutely in love with his husband, and seeing the two of them out there on the ice, their grace and beauty, and just the way they looked at each other, she could understand Victor a lot more than she ever had before. She could also understand why he was head over heels in love with Yuuri.\nAfter the show, the skaters stuck around for a little while, moving toward the barrier to say hello to their family, friends, and fans and taking pictures. Gloria held the rose she bought during intermission tightly in her hand as they made their way to where Victor and Yuuri were standing, arms around each other and surrounded by fans. When Victor spotted them behind the large group of fans he grinned and waved, gesturing for the fans to clear a path so they could make their way to the front.\n\u201cYou were stunning,\u201d Annabeth told him, unsure of what else to say. He thanked her with a smile and bent forward to stare at Gloria.\n\u201cAnd what did you think, princess?\u201d he asked. She held out the flower, staring at the ground.\n\u201cYou and Yuri and Yuuri were so pretty. Are you sure you\u2019re not a prince?\u201d\nVictor laughed as he grabbed the flower from her hands before bending forward a little more to give her a hug. \u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said, giving a small smile.\n\u201cReally, Yuuri, it was beautiful,\u201d Annabeth said while Victor was paying attention to her daughter. He blushed and gave her a small smile.\n\u201cThanks, Annabeth. I\u2019m glad you enjoyed it.\u201d\nThe car ride back home that night was filled with chatter from Gloria who wouldn\u2019t stop talking about Victor and his husband and Yuri.\n\u201cI looked them up,\u201d Daniel said as Annabeth climbed into bed, rubbing her eyes wearily. \u201cYour friend Victor is very famous, as is his husband. Also, Yuri is not his son. Apparently he\u2019s his 17 year old student, and is currently living with the pair. They have guardianship over him for visa purposes. Yuri is also very famous and between the three of them, there is probably no room in their house for any more medals.\u201d\nAnnabeth laid there for a second, processing what her husband had said.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered. She felt like a terrible friend.\n--\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Annabeth said when Victor walked into class the next day, cheerful as always, \u201cyou could have told me you were a retired figure skater. And that your husband is as well. I feel quite foolish.\u201d\nVictor pushed his lips out in a pout, his eyes wide. \u201cSorry,\u201d he cried out, forcing her to shush him when several of the students glanced over. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to intimidate anyone. I\u2019m already one of the oldest students here, I didn\u2019t want to say that I had been to the Olympics twice. And medaled twice. And all those other things. I just want to be Yuuri\u2019s husband, Victor.\u201d\nAnnabeth gave him a smile, nodding to show she understood. \u201cWell, Gloria is certainly in love with you, and with your husband and son,\u201d she said, putting extra emphasis on the last word. Because really, for the longest time she had assumed that Yuri and Gloria were around the same age. No 29 year old has a 17 year old son.\n\u201cDoes she want to come learn how to skate?\u201d Victor asked, clapping his hands together in excitement. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even have to pay, I can just take her. What\u2019s the point of being a living legend if you don\u2019t get to use your powers to get free skate lessons, am I right?\u201d he asked.\nAnnabeth smiled at him warmly. \u201cShe\u2019d like that.\u201d\n\u201cOh! And if you come to the rink you can officially meet Yuri. He likes married women with daughters for some reason, but not in a creepy way?\u201d Victor said, not sounding sure of himself. \u201cHe really liked Yuuri\u2019s friend who has triplets, can you believe it? He still talks to them. Anyway, you\u2019ll love him. He\u2019s so fun to tease and-\u201d\nHe continued talking for a few more minutes and Annabeth smiled and nodded while she listened, waiting for the teacher and happy with her newfound friend."
