    "text": "\nThey stand there, gathered in their stolen vehicle-slash-home, acting as an audience for the vicious argument currently raging across the awkwardly placed breakfast table. Max, Nancy and Steve. Faces blazing and voices hoarse\n\u2014though Nancy more so argues in defense of her plan, the one she\u2019d so carefully formulated all morning\u2014unlike Steve and Max, who seem just about ready to tussle over one, minute detail of that plan.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo. No way,\u201d Steve repeats, again, for what feels like the \n\nbillionth \n\ntime, not even pretending to back down or compromise.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do, Steve, it\u2019s the only way this works!\u201d Max slams her hands down on the table-top in a whirlwind of rage, the others still sitting back, watching in a mix of awe and fear.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUh, \n\nyeah, \n\nI can, and I will, and uh, \n\nno, \n\nit\u2019s not,\u201d Hands finding his hips, Steve marks her with the stubbornness of a bull\u2014the two of them going toe to toe is almost always a novelty when they share that common trait; inutterable amounts of will. \u201cNancy\u2019s plan is brilliant. It\u2019s great, as always,\u201d He butters her up, trying and failing with the Harrington charm. \u201cAll I am \n\nsaying\n\n is that we swap some people around.\u201d Making a little rotating gesture with his fingers, his audience looked on expectantly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh yeah? And who else is Vecna going to want? You can\u2019t just throw someone else in there and expect him to just take them, that\u2019s shitty, Steve,\u201d Max tosses one of her loose braids over her shoulder as she stares at the gaggle of her friends behind her, making a very obvious facial expression that\u2019s intended to call them to her defense.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey stay quiet. Even Nancy has fallen silent, now, drawn into the audience of a Mayfield-Harrington showdown.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nGrimacing, Steve rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna do that, \n\nduh.\n\n I\u2019ll go instead.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe passive bystanders become ultimately less passive; speaking over one another in a variety of complaints, most of them being \n\nno.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNancy attempts to talk him down, rapidly shaking her head.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSteve, that doesn\u2019t make \n\nany \n\nsense,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAggressively dismissing their protests with repetitive hand gestures, Steve stands from the camper-vans built in seats, speaking in the way he usually did when the kids were trying to put themselves in the line of fire. \u201cYes, it does. Out of everyone here, I\u2019ve suffered the least.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe allows for a pause, just in case anyone argues. They don\u2019t.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bait that Vecna creep and when he takes it, he won\u2019t have an easy time of it. We keep playing Kate Bush, I stall him long enough for Nancy, Robin and Erica to set him on fire in the Upside Down. Lucas and Max can blast some tunes on the sound system in the trailer, distract the bats,\u201d Then he turns to the final two, who stare at him expectantly. \u201cEddie and Dustin, you\u2019ll come with me to the Creel House. If I start floating, there\u2019s no one I trust more than you morons to get me down safely.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe silence stretches out a pause longer, before Max throws down the nearest object (a pen that then bounces away across the space,) and strides over to jab Steve in the chest with an accusatory finger. \u201cThat\u2019s fucking stupid. You can\u2019t do that just because you think I can\u2019t handle it. Plus, why would he even take you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve sighs, eyes shifting down to her, tired but rimmed with a brotherly fondness. \u201cSimple. I go in there, say I\u2019ll do anything to make your pain stop\u2014I\u2019ll tell him we know he needs four, that Nancy told us so,\u201d He nods in the girl\u2019s direction before pressing on. \u201cI\u2019ll say you\u2019re like a sister to me. A goddamn \n\nannoying\n\n one who likes to \n\nargue \n\nwith me \n\nall \n\nthe \n\ntime\n\n, but still. I\u2019ll tell him that I don\u2019t want you to die. Tell him to take me instead. Let you live.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nFaltering, Max fumbles for words, brow furrowed so hard Steve wonders how her face doesn't get stuck like that. \u201cThat\u2019s \n\ndumb\n\n. He\u2019ll never believe that, he can see into our \n\nminds\n\n, Steve.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDefiantly, Steve folds his arms over his chest, though there\u2019s a hint of defensiveness about him. \u201cThat\u2019s good. That he can read my mind.\u201d He swallows, thickly. \u201cBecause it\u2019s true. He\u2019ll know it\u2019s true, and he\u2019ll take me instead while you stick with Lucas \n\naway \n\nfrom Vecna.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s quiet, then. Max looks a mix of shocked and furious, but she doesn\u2019t speak, only stares at him, like he\u2019s some puzzle she can\u2019t figure out.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve makes use of the opportunity. \u201cAll in favour of Nancy\u2019s plan, a little re-jigged?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Eddie, (he could just kiss him for the relief of it), speaks up for him. \u201cYeah, man. Sure. Henderson, Harrington and Munson? We\u2019ll be the best bait and switch ever.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nRobin looks uneasy, but she trusts him, clearly, because she punches his arm. \u201cWhatever, dingus. Me, Nance and Erica will have Henry-slash-Vecna-slash-One begging for mercy,\u201d She loops her arm around Erica\u2019s shoulders, giving the girl a squeeze. \u201cHave you seen her? She\u2019s sneaky. She\u2019ll slip into his lair and he\u2019ll never even know what hit him.\u201d She grins. \u201cAnd Nance is a total badass. Vecna will be sobbing for forgiveness the second she whips that felony shotgun out.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is stupid,\u201d Max protests, though quieter, more unsure.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nLucas stands up, putting a hand on her shoulder. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. You\u2019re more vulnerable, he\u2019d take the bait quicker, sure, but\u2026 he\u2019d kill you quicker, too. He\u2019s already tried it once, he won\u2019t fail again. Plus, like Steve said, he\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cA suburbia-born rich boy with daddy\u2019s lovely money?\u201d Eddie pipes up.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve holds a flinch back at that comment, not protesting for the sake of keeping the players in his field.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Lucas nods, making a gesture to Max. \u201cSee? It\u2019ll work. Besides, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re on the bench, Max, we\u2019re literally gonna be drawing hundreds of deadly bats to Eddie\u2019s Upside Down trailer. This just means that we have, like\u2026 a seventy percent chance of death, rather than you having a ninety-eight percent chance.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDustin shrugs, \u201cI dunno, that sounds a little too optimistic.\u201d Eddie's shoulder barges him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSighing in the way she does when she is \n\ntruly \n\nexhausted by the company she keeps, Nancy stands, arms folding over her army gear, and levels them all with a judgemental stare. \u201cFine. Now that\u2019s figured out,\u201d She glares at Steve, \u201cLet\u2019s go through it again, new additions included,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHand grasping Eddie\u2019s as the guy hesitates to push himself off the mattress, Steve yanks him upright with enough force to nearly topple them both over. Clumsily steadying the pair of them, Steve just grins lopsidedly in the direction of his current victim. Eddie smiles back, tired, yet still dimples-and-all.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s because he\u2019s about to go toe to toe with Vecna, or maybe something else\u2014something he doesn\u2019t have the time to consider\u2014but as they walk through the forest in the darkness, (trying to make sure nobody spots a wanted murder,) Steve reaches out for his hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie takes it, obviously, because he\u2019s earnest and raw and compassionate in a really weird, but warm way; lacing their fingers together and squeezing. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be just swell, Stevie. Me and my baby have got you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor a second, Steve thinks he means \n\nDustin, \n\nbefore Eddie looks over his shoulder to where his guitar has been slung. Right.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure you can play it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI can play anything, Stevie,\u201d Eddie brings their linked hands up, pressing a kiss to the back of Steve\u2019s. \u201cEven if it\u2019s god-awful.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey\u2014\u201d Steve groans, though doesn\u2019t drop Eddie\u2019s hand. \u201cTears For Fears are \n\nnot \n\ngod-awful. They\u2019re heartfelt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nScoffing, Eddie yanks him to the side a little, chuckling when Steve nearly trips. \u201cI\u2019m shocked you haven\u2019t noticed yet, Stevie, but I\u2019m not a heartfelt kinda guy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow it\u2019s Steve\u2019s turn to scoff\u2014stopping abruptly to stare into Eddie\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a bad liar, Munson. All you\u2019ve done since I\u2019ve met you is be heartfelt,\u201d He looks ahead, then, at where Dustin is half-jogging, their lookout in case some weird Hawkins sucker is \n\nalso \n\ncreeping around in the woods at night.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie doesn\u2019t say anything to that. Just looks stunned, shakes his head and drops Steve\u2019s hand. \u201cYou gotta stop shattering my worldview, man,\u201d Is all he offers before he skips on ahead after the younger boy, leaving Steve to stare at the back of his hand, a bit lost.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe shakes it off. Steve\u2019s got to be Vecna's bait, deciphering the Munson mystery was for another time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich is probably why instead of letting himself hesitate, he gently opens the door, kicking off his shoes on the step and raising his eyebrows at his company until they remember to do the same.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie looks blankly at him for a second, then silently \n\nohhh\u2019s, \n\nunzipping his boots and padding on ahead into the Creel house barefoot. Steve hears the buzz of the lamp Eddie holds fade away into the quiet of the house, flicking the switch to his own and carefully climbing the stairs as he ensures Dustin is ready to take the floor below him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey search\u2014spanning out across the vast, disconcerting space of the Creel House, their lights the only comfort available\u2014yet also their beacons, their scythes as they search for the Reaper.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve has no luck on the second floor, dipping in and out of bedrooms to no avail. He\u2019s just considering abandoning the space entirely when a floorboard creaks nearby, and he turns, panicked\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie presses a hand over Steve\u2019s mouth, miming \n\nshush. \n\nSteve, though unable to stop his heart from racing, relaxes, glancing down at the paper note Eddie lifts, in his chicken scratch: \n\nFound Vecna.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey silently glide down the staircase together, finding Dustin already waiting, hesitantly hovering in the entryway, his own notepad jittering in shaking hands before he eventually gathers the courage to hold it up.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPhase one?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve nods, gives his shoulder a comforting pat, before watching the boy be on his merry way, fleeing the house to meet Robin, Nancy and Erica in the playground on the flip side.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(And really they had no way of knowing about the dog walker, because who walks their dog past creepy Creel House at this hour?)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt leaves Steve and Eddie, side-by-side, waiting by the glowing light of Vecna for Dustin\u2019s next signal.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt doesn\u2019t come immediately\u2014so they sit together on a worn old sofa, Eddie\u2019s knees criss-crossed, while Steve\u2019s are at a weird angle, unable to get comfortable under the circumstances. Eddie seems to sense it, too, because he starts scribbling away on his notepad.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHey.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve stares, then scribbles back.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHi.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie smiles, then, and doodles this time, quickly illustrating a stick-figure replica of himself strumming a guitar.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYou\u2019re gonna be fine.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe corners of his eyes crinkling, Steve leans against Eddie a little, taking his pen and drawing a replica of himself, clapping, eyes wonky hearts instead of simple dots.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI know, \n\nSteve mouths, resting his hand on top of Eddie\u2019s.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSomething passes over Eddie\u2019s face, a thought, a want\u2014but then it\u2019s illuminated by artificial, flickering light. Dustin\u2019s torch.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPushing off from the sofa, Steve tiptoes to the window, taking his torch out to flicker it back to Dustin. He swallows dread that tastes suspiciously like bile, and does his best to smile at Eddie, who continues to look unjustly upset by the whole ordeal.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe rises from their previous place, stepping over to Steve, taking both of his hands into his and \n\nsqueezes. \n\nPulling them up to his mouth one at a time, kissing the backs of his palms (for luck, he supposes) and pressing their heads together, jittering with nerves.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve takes a deep breath, knocking their foreheads, before he releases Eddie, eyes brazenly earnest.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe takes his bat from where he\u2019s stashed it, in a sling on his back, and scoops the lamp back up again.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nInhale.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve starts crashing his bat against his lamp, screaming and shouting bloody murder as he makes as much noise as he\u2019s capable of with the wound on his throat, anything to try and get some attention.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, \n\nasshole, \n\ncome pick on someone your own size!\u201d Crash, crash, crash. Steve hammers the bat into the deformed metal. \u201cYou want a real fight, instead of picking on some kids? Come and fucking get me, you overgrown piece of circumcised \n\nforeskin\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie almost laughs at that, and is met with Steve\u2019s scorn, violently shushing him. Vecna can\u2019t know he\u2019s here, too\u2014out of the two, Eddie\u2019s far more easy pickings.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you hurt Max ever again, jackass. Even if I die trying, I\u2019m gonna fucking kill you,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s that line that startles the light into dimming from Steve\u2019s lamp\u2014he turns to Eddie, who\u2019s just as solemn, and follows the stairs up to the attic, chasing the thrumming of the light.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt peaks in a collection of displaced furniture, damp and moth-eaten. Steve kneels, like it\u2019s an altar, and \n\nprays, \n\nprays he takes the bait.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t. Not at first. Not even when Steve swears and shouts and curses his name and family ten times over. It gets so desperate that Eddie looks just about ready to speak up, to offer himself instead\u2014and then Steve knows he can\u2019t half-ass this.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou have to take me,\u201d He grips the hollow wood of the chair next to him. \u201cPlease. You have to. Those kids, they\u2019re\u2014they're \n\nmy \n\nkids, y\u2019know? I look after them, they\u2019re like\u2014sometimes it feels like we\u2019re all a family.\u201d Steve gnaws at his lip. \u201cAnd that\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s all I ever really wanted, when I was younger. A big ol\u2019 family, lots of siblings, younger siblings. People who\u2019d look at me and go \n\nshit, \n\nhe\u2019s so cool, protecting us, like that,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve falters, taking another violent inhale of breath in through his grit teeth. \u201cWhich is why you can\u2019t take Max, she\u2019s\u2014she\u2019s a little shit, but she\u2019s \n\nmy \n\nlittle shit, she\u2019s\u2014my responsibility. So you can\u2019t take her. Please. \n\nPlease,\u201d \n\nHis chest heaves, his head bows. \u201cYou need four deaths. For four gates, Henry, Nancy\u2014Nance told us. Let me \n\nhelp \n\nyou.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBecause Max, she\u2019s\u2014she\u2019s gonna keep playing her music, and you won\u2019t find her. But me? I\u2019m \n\noffering. \n\nI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m giving you a free shot here. Take me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe room remains silent, save for the constant hum of the light by Steve\u2019s head\u2014but then, despite \n\npromising \n\nhe wouldn\u2019t, Eddie deviates from the plan.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Steve, it\u2019s not \n\nworking,\u201d \n\nAnd he looks angry, \n\nfurious, \n\nas he storms over to him, shoving hard enough to land Steve unceremoniously on his ass. \u201cWhat a big surprise though, right? Your hero plot, foiled. The others\u2014they were saying how you\u2019d grown up, but right now? This self-absorbed failure? This is all King Steve,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nEddie,\u201d \n\nSteve\u2019s words get caught in his throat. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m sorry, okay? But you\u2019re\u2014you have to stop speaking, man, or he\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen Eddie\u2019s eyes dive into the back of his skull, mouth falling slack, arms splayed out at his sides, and \n\nGod \n\ndoes Steve wish he stuck with his music lessons. Because as soon as Eddie freezes like that, there\u2019s no time to try and even pretend to save him with some half-assed plan\u2014he begins to levitate, despite Steve\u2019s fighting attempts to drag him back down to the safety of the floor.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe has his arms looped around his legs, trying to pull him back down\u2014when the \n\ncrack \n\ncomes. Eddie\u2019s legs, severing at odd angles, jutting out of his flesh in a garish, horrifying display, his arms swift to follow. And before Steve even has the chance to scream any louder, Eddie\u2019s eyes explode back into his skull, and he drops. Collapses to the floor in a broken pile of limbs at all inclinations, sitting uncomfortably under his skin as Steve gathers him up in his hold.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEddie?\u201d He whispers, to the corpse, the empty eye sockets glaring back at him. \u201c\n\nEddie?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt seems that he\u2019d made enough of a fuss in his grief\u2014because he hears the thunderous footfalls of someone climbing the stairs, tries his best to gather Eddie\u2019s maimed body close to his chest, too close for Dustin to see\u2014but it\u2019s too little too late.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDustin stands in the doorway, takes one look at the scene before him, and shrieks. Shrieks, and shrieks, and wails and howls with agony.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat did you \n\ndo?!\u201d \n\nHis voice is hoarse, raw with the salt of his tears. \u201c\n\nYou \n\nkilled him, \n\nSteve, \n\nit was meant to be \n\nyou!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nEyes wide enough to ache, Steve stamours to try and muster some sort of apology, or excuse, or \n\nanything, \n\nbut can\u2019t\u2014he sits there, shaking violently with the ruptured rag doll of Eddie in his arms.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then Dustin\u2019s head snaps back, his eyes rolling into whites, and Steve really \n\nscreams, \n\nthen, because this is his \n\nworst \n\nnightmare, the most \n\nunforgivable \n\nfailure\u2014he falls to his knees at Dustin\u2019s side, shaking him, sobbing\u2014and then he begins to sing, fighting for his voice to stay vigilant, to stop \n\ncracking.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cTurn\u2014\n\nturn, a\u2014\n\nround, \n\nlook at what you\u2026 what you see\u2014e,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDustin flies upwards, hands and legs spread rigidly. Steve bowls with rage and agony, recalcitrant from his better instincts, grief tearing him apart from the inside like hands \n\npushing \n\nhis ribs open, fisting his heart and \n\ntwisting\n\n it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn some cruel turn of fate, Steve is forced to watch Dustin\u2019s limbs fracture off in unnatural directions, bear witness to the way his jaw cracks away from his face; his eyes, so gentle, so kind, nothing but gaping holes that glare at him accusingly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve kneels, tears uncontrollably streaming down his face as his mouth hangs open, so bereaved he can\u2019t even \n\nmove, \n\nnot even to try and tell the others\u2014he can\u2019t \n\nmove. \n\nHe\u2019s stuck. And he begs, then, sobbing, for Vecna to just \n\nget it over with, \n\nto take \n\nhim, \n\nplease, \n\nplease, \n\nplease. Please.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPlease.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie sits up, limbs hanging out of their sockets as he does. Dustin drags himself across the floor by his broken fingertips.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nJoin us,\u201d \n\nThey beckon, harmonious, despite the aberrant angle of their jaws, hanging low on their faces. \n\n\u201cSteve.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFace raw from his own affliction, scratches from his own nails leaving angry, raised lines down his cheeks\u2014Steve scrambles backwards, heaving, panting, panicking.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen it all clicks into place.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t real\u2014\u201d Steve laughs, laughs at the broken, contorted corpses at his feet. \u201cYou took the bait, you son of a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nA vine, thick and hot, lashes out from Eddie\u2019s misshapen mouth, curling itself around Steve\u2019s leg and \n\ndragging him, \n\nwhipping his listless body through the Creel House, pulling and pulling until his surroundings are a blur of trees, his arms and legs and neck and face a graveyard of cuts from the rubble of the forest floor, his yells and struggles heard by no one.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis descent stops at the shore of Lover\u2019s Lake.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe lies there, splayed out, the pulsing sensation of the vine still curling around his appendage. Throbbing, a promise of more.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSteve,\u201d \n\nAnd there\u2019s Vecna\u2014the mirror image of the description both Max and Nancy had given, all rotten flesh and unnatural anatomy. \n\n\u201cDo you really think,\u201d \n\nThe vine jolts, taking Steve\u2019s body into the shallows. \n\n\u201cI took your \n\nbait? \n\nYou,\u201d \n\nDeep enough that he can\u2019t breathe, water drawn into his nose, his mouth. \u201c\n\nTook,\u201d \n\nAnd then a pause of mercy. Of nothingness.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMine.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve is trawled under the water, with even more force than the time before, so recent, yet so distant. As he struggles, he can make out the blinding light of three watchful pairs of eyes above him, three figures on a boat at the surface.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey see him. He knows they do. But they do not come for him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnly this time when Steve is dragged through the gate, he doesn\u2019t find himself as flesh for the bats\u2014he\u2019s in a car. A car, submerged in water.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe door opens, suddenly\u2014the vine dragging him off of the sodden seats, and he finds himself on tarmac instead, coloured with playground chalk.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s Hawkin\u2019s Elementary.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve stands, soaked to the bone, beaten and bloody, in the middle of his old preschool playground, shaken, bewildered. Because of all places, why would Vecna bring him here?\n\n\u00a0\n\nNothing happened in preschool.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSteve! Steven, baby!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHead snapping up to the source of the call, Steve notes a woman with a beautiful head of golden-blonde hair, flailing her arms back and forth just in case he hadn\u2019t seen her.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUh\u2014hi?\u201d Noting the absence of the vine around his leg, Steve limps forwards, baffled by the sheer, exhilarating joy on the woman\u2019s face as he approaches. He\u2019s not exactly a sight for sore eyes\u2014but she looks positively delighted.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe leans over the fence as he arrives, and suddenly Steve finds that the woman is much, much taller, and he is far, far smaller. \n\n\u201cOh, Buttercup. Mommy missed you,\u201d \n\nAnd she leans over, tries to scoop him up, eyes empty and confused when he steps back away from her.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d \n\nSteve finds himself saying, passive in his own younger body.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe woman\u2019s face crumples. \u201c\n\nDon\u2019t say that, baby. You\u2019re my baby, my baby boy, my son\u2014you\u2019re my son. \n\nMy\n\n son,\u201d \n\nAnd she grabs him, then, looping her arms around his middle and \n\nsqueezing \n\nas he struggles.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow that she\u2019s close, close enough to press kisses to the top of his head, to his face, Steve knows who she is. Only from pictures, old photo albums.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s his aunt. His mother\u2019s sister. Aunt Julie.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe died when Steve was a kid. It was one of the many things the Harringtons never spoke about. Steve knows this. But Steve doesn\u2019t remember this at all. Not one bit of it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cJulie!\u201d \n\nHe knows that voice, no matter how long it\u2019s been since he heard it. His mother storms across the lot, flanked by police officers and men in a hospital-like uniform. \n\n\u201cPut him down!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis Aunt Julie doesn\u2019t\u2014she only holds him tighter, one arm curled around his neck too tight, too tight for Steve to breathe around, the flesh of the limb twitching and shifting back and forth from supple skin to thick, hot plant life, the vine coiling around his throat unforgivably.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s mine! He\u2019s my son, you can\u2019t take him! He\u2019s \n\nmine, \n\nmine, mine, mine, mine!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe\u2019s screaming, and Steve can hear some of his classmates crying, distantly, before suddenly she seizes up around him, convulsing. Collapsing to the floor, Steve is free for a moment thanks to the tasers of the ward guards, (he remembers that, a hushed argument about the expenses of his Aunt\u2019s \n\nspecial \n\nhospital), before he\u2019s grabbed by his mother, grabbed by the \n\nneck \n\nand thrown backwards.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s not in the playground anymore. His back collides with a shelf of assorted sweets, and he crumples, sitting on the linoleum floor in a small heap.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a supermarket, he thinks, vaguely.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cStay there. Don\u2019t fucking move from this spot until I come to get you, Steven.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s his mother. She\u2019s scratching at the back of her hands in the way she does when she wants to pop a pill to take the edge off\u2014clearly, in this memory, that edge is Steve. \n\n\u201cYou ungrateful little shit. God, you\u2019re just like her, sometimes? Maybe you deserve each other.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then she\u2019s flouncing off, and Steve\u2019s alone in the aisle, the aisle that keeps shifting to look a little too much like Starcourt Mall for his liking. Tilting the world to the side on its axis.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cButtercup,\u201d \n\nSteve\u2019s not sure how long has passed\u2014but it\u2019s dark, \n\ndark, \n\nin the supermarket, the artificial lights above them flickering and dying as his Aunt Julie sprints towards him, body contorted and wrong. He doesn\u2019t have the chance to stand before he\u2019s breathing in something sweet.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEyes flying open, Steve\u2019s back in the car\u2014splayed out on the backseat, vines fastening him to the vehicle as it sinks.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Steven,\u201d\n\n Aunt Julie soothes from the driver's seat. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be together forever, now. They lied to you, Stevey-bear. They told tall tales. I\u2019m your real mother,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve sits there, starved for air, feeling the water rise to his knees, to the waist. \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d \n\nThe woman punches the shotgun seat, shrieking for a moment before she breathes, calms. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t understand, Buttercup. I\u2019ll explain it all when we\u2019re far away from here. They said I was too sick to have you, to raise you. No, no, not my baby.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, Steve,\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHer voice contorts, and for a flash Steve sees Vecna, glowering at him from the rear-view mirror, just before his head is submerged in the water, and he remembers, now.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nRemembering Aunt Julie\u2019s funeral. Remembering the gossip, the horrified whispers. \n\nShe\u2019d driven the car into Lover\u2019s Lake, and tried to take poor little Steve with her.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI can't imagine how his parents must feel. You can\u2019t control crazy.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNo. Steve doesn\u2019t want to believe it. It\u2019s not real\u2014Vecna\u2019s making it up to distress him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut it seems that Vecna takes that as a challenge, of sorts. Because the window closest to Steve\u2019s submerged head suddenly shatters\u2014he\u2019s dragged, feet first through it, out of the car, out of the water\u2014sprawled out on his back as he\u2019s thrown back to the shore.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe can\u2019t feel the sand, though. And when he opens his eyes, he recognizes Joyce Byers\u2019 ceiling, in a haze of pain and confusion.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThen there\u2019s a weight on his waist, Steve notices, in a pain-addled trance. It only takes one glance for dread to stew in his gut, brothing over until he barely remembers to suck his teeth.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBecause Billy is straddling him, drawing his arm back to take a swing. And another. And another, and another, and another, and another and another another another another\u2014and Steve remembers that somewhere in the midst of Billy knocking out his teeth, breaking his nose, his jaw, his cheekbones\u2014that Max should\u2019ve stopped him by now.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe risks a glance over Billy\u2019s shoulder as it\u2019s in motion to strike again\u2014Max isn\u2019t there. The kids aren\u2019t either.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJust Vecna. Taunting him, watching as the blood trickling down his throat is too thick to even cry out or scream anymore, studying Steve when he goes from agonized to complacent to passive.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nClearly, that makes the punishment null for Vecna. Because then Billy shifts from himself to the Russian who\u2019d tortured him, then to the \n\nDemogorgon, \n\nand that opens a new pathway of opportunity as Steve is then surrounded, the Demodogs circling him in Joyce\u2019s home.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nVecna leaves enough time for Steve to figure out what\u2019s going to happen to him before it does.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey tear into his flesh, and no matter how much he tries to remind himself that this isn\u2019t \n\nreal, \n\nhe can \n\nfeel \n\nit, feel their teeth, feel himself come away\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd he screams, because it\u2019s all he can do. Because Vecna should\u2019ve and could\u2019ve killed him what feels like \n\nhours \n\nago, but he\u2019s toying with him, Steve decides. Torturing him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe it\u2019s punishment for his arrogance. For thinking that he wouldn\u2019t have anything Vecna could use, not like this, in this dreamscape of torment. Or maybe Vecna wants to enjoy his final kill. Because the Demodogs fade away, and his fleshy, hooked hand splays out in front of Steve\u2019s face, and he cries.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe cries, partly out of relief, partly out of acknowledgement that he\u2019s failed. He\u2019ll die now, when Vecna is still alive, meaning that either Steve has been here for far less time than it feels like, or something has happened to Robin, to Eddie, to Dustin, to Nancy\u2014maybe even Erica or Max or Lucas. Somewhere, something has failed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd it\u2019s Steve\u2019s fault. They\u2019re all going to die.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe closes his eyes, and sobs, bitterly. Waiting for the brutal conclusion to what he can safely call the \n\nworst \n\nexperience of his \n\nlife.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n(But part of him is grateful. Part of him feels closure in the fact that he didn\u2019t let Max go through this again. And she\u2019ll never have to.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in his closure, comes a sudden \n\nroar.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve collapses to the floor. He\u2019s on his knees. He grips his sides, and finds his body repaired, not torn apart in chunks, not drowned or beaten.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd there stands \n\nEleven\n\n. Their girl with \n\nsuper powers.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe\u2019s \n\nhere. \n\nAnd despite all that had come before, and the daze he sits in now, Steve knows she\u2019s real. He feels it. He senses her, the power she holds \n\nhumming \n\ninside of him as he watches her \n\ntoss \n\nVecna across the red-tinted hells cape the three of them now reside in.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(He recognizes it, vaguely, from Max\u2019s drawings. The clock, floating, the fragments of Creel House above head.)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile their fight rages on behind him, he scrambles, body coated in the thick, hot red of Vecna\u2019s perdition, to try and get away. His mind feels detached from the rest of them, though, in hindsight, maybe that\u2019s due to the supernatural beings \n\nfighting \n\nin it\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut after running so far, he remembers. \n\nEddie.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cEddie!\u201d \n\nSteve\u2019s desperate, now, turning in circles pleading for anything, the sign Max described when they\u2019d saved her at Billy\u2019s grave. \u201cEddie!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd he runs, again, because he feels it all he \n\ncan \n\ndo\u2014but then the red thickness around his ankles shifts into the tangle of bedsheets, and Steve is tumbling out of \n\nhis \n\nbed, in \n\nhis \n\nroom\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe pool glows, illuminating the dark space in its sickly artificial light. It basks Steve\u2019s father in it, who stands in the doorway, face not quite right, but not quite \n\nwrong \n\neither.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI always knew\n\n,\u201d He\u2019s crawling closer, almost serpent-like, fingers a little too long, body a little too fluid. \u201c\n\nYou may be my son, but you aren\u2019t my wife\u2019s,\n\n\u201d Then he strikes, viper-like, and grabs Steve\u2019s face, nails sinking into the flesh of his cheeks, drawing blood.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nDad,\u201d \n\nSteve chokes, and then his other hand curls around his throat, forcing his head to turn at an unnatural angle\u2014forcing him to look back to his bed.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he\u2019s found Eddie, he supposes. Because Eddie\u2019s there, half dressed, sat upright in Steve\u2019s bed, looking \n\nterrified, \n\nand \n\nangry, \n\nscared for Steve, even more scared for himself.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nOh. \n\nOh.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDad\u2014\u201d Steve struggles, failing to fight as the long, clawed fingers curl around his throat, cut into his Adam\u2019s apple until he can\u2019t breathe, let alone speak.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI always knew there was something \n\nwrong \n\nwith you,\u201d \n\nComes the hiss of uncomfortably hot breath by Steve\u2019s ear. \n\n\u201cDo you even realize, Steve? That this is \n\nwrong?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nVecna\u2019s voice merges with the dull monotonous strain of his father\u2019s, hissing sweet venom against his face. \n\n\u201cThat you\u2019re \n\nwrong? \n\nYou don\u2019t even realize,\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie is across the room within the blink of Steve\u2019s fluttering eyelids, marking him with a look of sheer \n\ndisgust. \n\nAnd he approaches, takes Steve by the shoulders, and \n\nshoves.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThis willful ignorance,\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then Steve\u2019s back is pressed against \n\nhard \n\nand wet, vines curling around his limbs, bending them at unnatural angles to keep him there, \n\nstuck.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nIt ends now.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe searing pain in his arm that comes with the first \n\ncrack \n\nis different. Steve can \n\nfeel \n\nthe difference.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBecause it\u2019s \n\nreal.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd he \n\nscreams, \n\nthen, uses the very last of life in him to writhe and toss and \n\nbite, \n\nbiting down on one of Vecna\u2019s fingers, stalling him for just a second\u2014a drawn out, agonizing second.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut it\u2019s enough. Because across the way, Steve sees it. An opening to a room bathed in blue light, the thrums of \n\nmusic \n\nruminating from it like a heartbeat from a pulse point.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s enough\u2014because El is able to drop from where Vecna had her stuck, had her \n\nwatching \n\nwhat he was going to do to Steve\u2014and when she drops, she drops \n\nhard, \n\nsending Vecna soaring back, away from Steve.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBlood is streaming from her nose, her ears, her eyes\u2014but she looks at Steve, and musters the strength to shout:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cRun!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe does.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe purring hum of an electric guitar draws Steve to his start like a moth to flame, and he begins to run, \n\nrun\n\n like he\u2019s never moved before.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI wanted to be with you alone,\n\n\n\n\nAnd talk about the weather,\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe hissing snakes of Vecna\u2019s vines whip after him, Steve narrowly missing the curve of one around his ankle, tears streaming down his face as he throws all of himself into listening.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nBut traditions I can trace against the child in your face,\n\n\n\n\nWon't escape my attention,\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nListening to Eddie, to \n\nEddie, \n\nEddie playing that cheesy, stupid song that Steve likes too much.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou keep your distance via the system of touch,\n\n\n\n\nAnd gentle persuasion,\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nListening to Eddie sing, voice rough and full of pain, and desperation, neediness strummed through on the growls of his guitar.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI'm lost in admiration, could I need you this much?\n\n\n\n\nOh, you're wasting my time,\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe laughs, and sobs, hurling himself over vines and fleshy, vicious obstacles in his path, every burning step getting him \n\ncloser, \n\nhugging the dead, aching weight of his broken arm to his chest.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou're just, just, just wasting time,\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve\u2019s close\u2014he knows he is. So close that when he trips, one stray vine snapping around his ankle, he cries out\u2014and swears by the look on Eddie\u2019s face through the gaping tear in reality that he \n\nheard \n\nhim.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSomething happens and I'm head over heels,\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe kicks, wrestles, and then brings the vine up to his mouth, contorting his body, and he \n\nbites, \n\ntears through it with his teeth.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI never find out until I'm head over heels,\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd it drops, severed in his lap, Steve \n\ncrawling \n\nto get away, crawling with one arm until he finds his footing again, skin baked in the red of Vecna\u2019s hellscape.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSomething happens and I'm head over heels,\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll he can do is run. He runs, runs until he feels his ribs are going to skewer him from the inside, runs until his lungs feel like they can no longer expand, runs until all he can taste is his own blood, sweat and tears.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAh, don't take my heart, don't break my heart,\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve\u2019s close enough now, just wisps away, close enough to see Eddie playing, sobbing over his guitar while his body levitates in the air above him. One of Steve\u2019s arms is pointing the wrong way, and Eddie looks a mess of marred flesh and swollen injury, but he keeps playing.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDon't, don't, don't throw it away,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis eyes open.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve drops.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSteve?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nYeah, no\u2014Steve is gone, the full Chrissy effect settling into the stiff posture of his body as his back straightens despite his kneeling position. Eddie resists the urge to hurl, forces himself to look away, to escape the temptation to relive what had happened in his trailer. (Though it felt like a lifetime ago, now.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe has to focus, but that\u2019s never been his strong suit, \n\never, \n\nin fact\u2014it\u2019s almost entirely the reason he\u2019s continued to fail school, aided by a hatred from his teachers and a general educational exhaustion. Eddie Munson is good at knowing when it\u2019s time to pack it up and go home.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhich is why he\u2019s going against every rule in the Munson Doctrine by still being here, trying to make sure \n\nSteve Harrington \n\nof all people doesn\u2019t become Vecna\u2019s next victim. Vecna, the inter dimensional \n\nmind demon.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie\u2019s always been told he\u2019s had one foot in crazy, but this feels beyond \n\ninsane.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNonetheless, he signals Dustin through the window, flashing the torch to indicate the start of phase three\u2014and gets no response.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie trusts Dustin. Trusts him more than anyone else in their little gaggle of monster fighters\u2014he\u2019s one of his best friends, no matter how lame that feels to say to other people. But when he flickers that torch time and time again and gets no response? That\u2019s when Eddie begins to worry.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo Eddie turns and looks at Steve, who\u2019s still kneeling (not floating yet, thank god), his eyes rolled back to milky whites instead of the chocolate browns he\u2019s so used to, his body slack yet stiff.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWills him to tell him what to do here. Because Steve is heroic, Steve dives into lakes headfirst to find supernatural gateways, Steve kills doglike demons with a bat, Steve tears underworld creature apart by the \n\nteeth. \n\nSteve would know what to do.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut Steve is busy doing those stupid heroics\u2014and that leaves Eddie. Eddie the Banished, who flees at the first glance of danger\u2014but he hasn\u2019t run yet. Instead, he rushes around trying to make sure everything is ready for when Steve \n\ndoes \n\nbegin to float, not willing to experience a rerun of Chrissy, especially not with Steve.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie still remembers the cutting, childish jealousy that came whenever Dustin would launch off a tangent about how badass Steve was, who at the time Eddie only knew as \n\nKing Steve, \n\nthe same guy who\u2019d lost his girlfriend to Jonathan Byers and had gone fisticuffs with him behind the theatre.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(That kind of news always sent shockwaves across the little freak community at Hawkins High, Gareth had told him all about it with a blunt between two fingers, definitely more invested than he claimed to be:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying, it\u2019s \n\ncrazy\n\n. Steve Harrington losing a girl like Nancy Wheeler to Jonathan Byers, of all guys. Either Steve\u2019s losing his touch or maybe guys like us stand a chance,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd he\u2019d elbowed Eddie when he\u2019d said that, as if Eddie would ever be interested in a girl like Nancy Wheeler, or any straight-laced, flowery-scented \n\ngirl \n\nat all. But Gareth was never intentionally cruel, nor did he really have ill-intentions in conversations like these, so Eddie would always just tune him out.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTake another hit and blame it on the good stuff.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut King Steve had become \n\nStevie \n\nas soon as Eddie reluctantly followed them all down into the hellscape that was the Upside Down, just to save his life\u2014or maybe, more specifically, Steve had become \n\nStevie\n\n when Eddie\u2019s heart nearly stopped. Over that \n\nbat. \n\nThe bat he\u2019d taken into his mouth and shredded with his \n\nteeth.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat sort of stuff does things to a guy who\u2019s Hawkin\u2019s given middle name was \n\nThe Freak. \n\nThe kind of thing that had him calling Steve \n\nbig boy, \n\nor getting up in his space, just to see how close he \n\ncould \n\nget before he hit the atmosphere and burnt up into nothingness.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd that kinda thing couldn\u2019t be carried into a place like this. No way. Eddie had bundled up all inappropriate urges for Steve Harrington and left them on the doorstep of Creel House like a fresh little orphan in a cute little basket.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn doing so, however, Eddie Munson had unfortunately learnt a few things about himself:\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThere was someone climbing the stairs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWarily, Eddie assumes it\u2019s Dustin, and calls out to him.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nJason Carver slams his way into the attic of the Creel House, shoulders as firm as iron, face as venomous as the tail end of a super pissed off scorpion. Distinctly, Eddie remembers having a nightmare similar to this, being discovered by Chrissy\u2019s boyfriend and suffering the slow, agonizing consequences.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nEddie\n\n Munson,\u201d With a flake of humour amongst a sea of fear, Eddie notes just how much Jason Carver speaks like a typical, corny movie villain. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a hard guy to find, recently, Munson.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s not sure what to do, where to stand\u2014so he settles for positioning himself in front of where Steve kneels, like a child trying to cover a mess they\u2019ve made. \u201cYou and your \n\nbuds \n\nhaven\u2019t exactly made\u2014being out and about \n\neasy \n\nfor me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt looks like Jason\u2019s lip curls to make another spiteful quip about Eddie\u2019s general existence, before he falters. In trying to shelter Steve, he only drew more attention to the other boy in the room\u2014and judging by the expression on their guest\u2019s face, made everything \n\nten \n\ntimes \n\nworse.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHarrington?\u201d Circling, Jason tries to get a better look at Steve, finding Eddie in his path.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstead of going, \n\nHey, Eds, don\u2019t suppose you mind shuffling to the left a little, I wanna get a good peak at Steve, there, \n\nJason Carver bares his teeth, and takes a gun out of his letterman jacket, kindly leveling it at Eddie.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cStep aside,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Eddie, though he does hesitate, stumbles a little to the left\u2014because if he gets \n\nshot, \n\nthere\u2019s nobody to save Steve. And then they\u2019re all fucked anyway. Four deaths? Game over.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, letting Jason see Steve from the front made any chance of negotiating his way out of this attic alive about a million to one.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat have you \n\ndone \n\nto him, devil worshipper?!\u201d Because in hindsight, he supposes he can understand where Jason might\u2019ve got that idea from. Steve Harrington, pretty-faced, straight-laced, golden-boy of the century, kneeling at what looked like an altar, eyes so far back into his head he seemed the loveliest little caricature of a possession victim.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(Then again, he sort of \n\nwas \n\nthat.)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut Eddie, because that\u2019s just who he is, chokes out a pained dismissal, an earnest, \u201cI didn\u2019t do this, Carver, you gotta listen to me,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nApparently, telling the guy who thinks you murdered his girlfriend to do anything is a really bad idea, because abruptly Eddie gets a kick to the chest, toppling backwards against one of the roof beams.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019ve gotta listen to \n\nme, \n\nyou goddamn \n\nfreak. \n\nI know what you are,\u201d (Boy, doesn\u2019t that sound familiar, Eddie thinks, bitter with the irony), \u201cI know about your transpondence with Satan. I know you\u2019re his vessel.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo this, Eddie realizes that the tiny inklings of utter insanity Jason Carver had shown before in his school-wide pep talks and the like had congealed and become one, big, monstrous mega-monopoly of \n\ntotal \n\nblazing \n\nlunacy.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat have you done to Steve Harrington?! I won\u2019t ask you again, \n\nfreak!\u201d \n\nThe gun gets up and personal in Eddie\u2019s face, now, the butt of it forced into his cheek, Jason Carver spitting with rage. From this close, Eddie can really see the way he shakes with it, with the sheer power a kid gets with a weapon in hand, with any sort of control over life like that.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t\u2014Jason, \n\nJason, J\u2014\n\nJason, man,\u201d Taking only light gasps of air in through his mouth, Eddie\u2019s hands dig into the wood of the roof support beam behind him, trying to find some semblance of stability. \u201cMan, \n\nman, \n\nI promise you this\u2014\n\nthis\n\n isn\u2019t me, this, the\u2014the. \n\nEverything, \n\nnothing, it wasn\u2019t me, it still isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d He\u2019s cut off by his own cry of pain when Jason grows tired of him talking and cracks the barrel of the gun against his jaw so hard, Eddie marvels over the strength of the bone for resisting a fracture.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJason\u2019s breath is hot on his face, and Eddie whimpers, whimpers for shame, for fear, for guilt\u2014because if this goes any more sideways, they\u2019re all going to die here.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a vile liar, freak. Let me take a guess, we\u2019ll see how right I am,\u201d Metallic-smelling hand gripping Eddie\u2019s face so hard he can barely breathe through his fingers, Jason presses on, a fire blazing in his eyes. \u201cSteve Harrington. You\u2019ve failed school, what, twice, now? So you two would\u2019ve started out together. You\u2019ve known him for a while, but you guys don\u2019t really \n\nrun \n\nin the same \n\ncircles. \n\nHe\u2019s popular, he\u2019s funny, he\u2019s got friends, girls, money, a pretty nice picket-fence future set up on the horizons,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s an asshole to you, maybe you guys butt heads back when he was in school. I don\u2019t remember you guys scuffling, at any point\u2014so maybe you\u2019re a friend of Byers. Freaks stick together, right?\u201d The tip of the gun is dragged down Eddie\u2019s temple, rendering him entirely too terrified to move.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve been planning this for a while. Nancy Wheeler picks him out\u2014seduces him, makes him the perfect target for you and your cult. Byers kicks him when he\u2019s down,\u201d The way Jason paints the picture\u2014it\u2019s grandiose, but Eddie can see it, in a way.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe way that you \u2018understand\u2019 a five year old thinking that money \n\nactually \n\ngrows on trees for a while until someone explains that it was a joke.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou did something to him, you and your cult, over thanksgiving. He came back \n\nbroken. \n\nNancy Wheelers your temptress, and when he wouldn\u2019t join you, you all did something,\u201d The gun is glued to his temple. \u201cI don\u2019t know what. But he hasn\u2019t been the same. He was the \n\nstar, \n\nMunson. We all wanted to be like him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd that makes sense, too. Jason, idolizing Steve\u2014he\u2019s older, and once would\u2019ve been Jason\u2019s senior, the captain of his basketball team when Jason was a freshman and bench warming. Guys like Jason would\u2019ve given anything to get a piece of \n\nKing Steve.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat, you think\u2014you think we did something to him, just\u2014just because, \u2018cause he came back and realized he\u2019d been a\u2014an A-grade, grade \n\nasshole,\u201d \n\nIt comes out a little shaky when his jaw won\u2019t move the way he wants it to.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJason doesn\u2019t like that. No, Jason wraps his hand around Eddie\u2019s throat and squeezes. \u201cI\u2019m talking, \n\nfreak. \n\nShut your goddamn mouth before I blow it wide open,\u201d And then the gun sits on Eddie\u2019s bottom lip, and he struggles for just a second until Jason forces it against his teeth, and he realizes then that he\u2019s \n\ncrying, \n\nhe\u2019s dry-heaving and trembling hard enough to hurt.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhatever you\u2019ve done to him, it\u2019s all\u2014all been leading up to this, hasn\u2019t it? You took Chrissy, then Fred, Patrick\u2026 all of this, he\u2019s your true sacrifice, isn\u2019t he?\u201d There\u2019s a wildness to Jason\u2019s eyes, something so out of reach that Eddie is \n\nfrightened, \n\nbecause he leaves no door open to empathize with him, let alone talk him down.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(Not that he could with a gun in his mouth.)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat \n\nI \n\ndon\u2019t get is why him? Why Steve?\u201d Yet again, he refuses to let Eddie respond, smacking the gun against the front of his teeth hard enough that he can feel his gums \n\nbleed. \n\n\u201cOut of all the guys, he was one of the better ones to you \n\nfreaks. \n\nIf you were doing it because you \n\nhated\n\n him, had some vendetta, it makes no sense. There are people who\u2019ve called you worse, \n\nMunson.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nDread drips like sweat down the dampness of his neck, and as soon as Eddie understands where Jason is going with this, and the guy seems to see that, feed on it. \u201cYou must be in love with him, \n\nfreak.\u201d \n\nEddie knows what word he really wants to use. \u201cMaybe this is what you think \n\nlove \n\nis. Sending him to be with your \n\nDevil \n\nin hell for eternity,\u201d He raises his voice, then, taking Eddie across to where Steve kneels by the neck, drawing the gun from out of his mouth to press against the back of his head, military style.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWake him up.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve\u2019s milky white eyes glare back at them.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Jason grabs a fist of Eddie\u2019s hair and \n\nsnaps \n\nhis head back against the butt of the gun. Not the answer he wanted, clearly. \u201cIf\u2014If I do, if I wake him up \n\nnow, \n\nmore people will die,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nJason clicks his tongue. \u201c\n\nNo, \n\nMunson, if you don\u2019t wake him up, \n\nyou \n\ndie. For Chrissy, for Patrick, for Steve. I\u2019ll blow your fucking brains out right here by his goddamn body.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s at that moment that Steve decides \n\nnow \n\nhe has to start levitating.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd despite his fear, despite the body-numbing, mouth-bleeding \n\nterror, \n\nit\u2019s exactly what Eddie needs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile Jason\u2019s head snaps to marvel at Steve\u2019s body beginning to lift, Eddie swerves out of his line of fire before turning and \n\ntackling \n\nhim to the floor. He takes his wrists and straddles him, going for the gun\u2014it\u2019s the only thing Eddie really succeeds at, tossing it across the room.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn doing so, he leaves himself open for Jason to roll them over, smacking Eddie\u2019s head against the floor once, twice\u2014he loses count after the fourth or fifth, and Jason loses interest, deciding that fists are much more exciting instead. Eddie can see Steve, though blurred and tinged with the red of his own blood running into his eyes\u2014lifting higher, higher, limbs falling stiff out behind him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNot that it matters\u2014Eddie was never a fighter. Eddie never started fights, they sought him out and beat him down, it was never fair, or even, just someone deciding they didn\u2019t like him, the \n\nfreak, \n\ndeciding that his mere existence had earned him the taste of his own blood, earned him a crooked nose that was now entirely facing the wrong way.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJason had definitely decided this was the case\u2014he sits on Eddie\u2019s chest and tears out handfuls of hair, swings and swings and swings until Eddie can\u2019t see, can\u2019t hear anything but his panting cries that this was all for \n\nChrissy, \n\nbut if Eddie knew anything about Chrissy, kind, gentle Chrissy\u2014she wouldn\u2019t have wanted this whether Eddie murdered her or not.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen he\u2019s certain that Eddie\u2019s in no state to follow after him, Jason stands, and barrages him with kicks in his side, gives his fists a rest\u2014he doesn\u2019t stop, not until he can hear the crack of Eddie\u2019s ribs, until his cries of pains subside into muted whimpers.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie can\u2019t move. He\u2019s a little sure that he might be missing one or two teeth, too. There\u2019s blood coming from his nose in gushing waves, a wound on his head that\u2019s blinding him as it streams down his face.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis fingers aren\u2019t broken, at least. Jason didn\u2019t get there yet.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s dwelling upon Jason when Eddie comes to the horrifying comprehension that Jason is gone. And Eddie can\u2019t follow after him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe cool metal of the gun against the back of his head confirms his worst suspicions.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJason. \n\nJason,\u201d \n\nEddie spits out one of his teeth, dry heaving over the floorboards of the attic. He knows it\u2019s useless, begging for his life\u2014Jason decided that he wanted Eddie dead as soon as Chrissy\u2019s body was found in his trailer. But he can\u2019t help it, nor can he help sobbing, sobbing bitterly because he can\u2019t believe this is how it all ends, how Nancy\u2019s plan is totally ruined, because Eddie\u2019s brains are about to decorate the floor in the Creel House and nobody will save Steve, and Hawkins will fall.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJason gives him no comfort into the hands of death. Instead, he kneels, picks Eddie up by the hair and laughs, cruelly, into his ear, and clicks the safety off. \u201cSee you in hell, \n\nfreak,\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd there\u2019s a crack, an ugly, gruesome crack. It doesn\u2019t sound much like a gunshot, but Eddie supposes it might sound different when it\u2019s lodged in his brain.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nA handful of seconds pass.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie\u2019s not dead. Jason Carver collapses in a heap next to him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEddie!\u201d With the last of his strength, he rolls over onto his back, coughing up a mouthful of blood.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe could cry for joy. It\u2019s \n\nDustin. \n\nWorse for wear, but \n\nDustin. \n\nGrinning, bruised and definitely beaten (by one of Jason\u2019s friends, no doubt, he thinks, sick to his stomach) holding Steve\u2019s nail bat like the Olympic torch.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis other hand is stuck out, an offering. Urgent\u2014as he notices Steve, poor Steve, convulsing in the air, the time he has left slim, yet crucial\u2014for all of them.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve\u2019s arm breaks.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019re out of time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTaking it, Eddie stands, choking back the urge to throw up his insides\u2014and takes his guitar, standing at the foot of Steve\u2019s hovering body, and uses whatever last life he has left kicking in him to play that stupid, corny song he likes.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe sings, though his voice is raw and pain litters his every word. He strums his guitar though his fingers shake and he thinks his shoulder might not be in its socket.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie plays for every person Vecna killed, for every injury inflicted on the kids since this all begun, for Nancy Wheeler and her felony shotgun, for Robin Buckley and her clumsy charm, for Max Mayfield and her admirable stubborn fire, for Lucas Sinclair for his deep compassion, for Erica Sinclair and her wits, her bravery despite her age. Eddie plays for Dustin, who can barely stand, but does so, stands \n\nwith \n\nhim, keeping him upright, his light in the darkness, his best friend.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie plays for Steve, \n\nswears \n\nhe can hear his voice, his anguish\u2014and Eddie plays harder, plays until tears are running rampant down his face, til he can barely breathe for pain and love and relief and fear.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPlays for Steve and his stupid, lopsided smile, plays for Steve and his perfectly mussed hair, plays for Steve and his earnest affection, Steve and his moronic bravery, Steve and his utter dedication to protecting them all.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Eddie knows that if this isn\u2019t enough\u2014if they lose, now, that they would\u2019ve fought as hard as they could. Steve, Eddie and Dustin, together, on the dusk of their final day, bleeding together, dying together.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie thinks that if he should die, there are no better people for him to die with.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe pushes that sentiment into the rasp of his voice, contorts his body to force it to keep \n\nplaying, \n\nrefuses to fall, now, though he can feel death clambering at him, clawing.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie plays for Steve. Plays with more heart than he\u2019s ever had.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve drops.\u00a0\n\n\nEddie follows suit.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hospital only had pink left for Steve\u2019s cast. Eddie thinks it\u2019s cute, Dustin thinks it\u2019s funny. \nThe three of them are in the same wing of Hawkin\u2019s medical for a couple days, with Eddie and Dustin\u2019s ribs both a sorry state, though Eddie much worse for wear. He supposes that Dustin must take after Steve that way\u2014he managed to fend of Jason\u2019s sadistic friend far better than Eddie did Jason, and it\u2019s evident. Evident in the way that boot prints climb up his side and his back, evident in the way that the nurse saw the break of Eddie\u2019s nose and said if Jason had hit any harder it might\u2019ve killed him for good. Evident in the severe shoulder injury they say he might never fully recover from, evident in the minor fracture of his jaw and the severe concussion that knocked him out in the attic, leaving Dustin with his two favorite, older male friends completely unconscious at his side.\u00a0\nHawkins Lab were quick with Eddie\u2019s government pardon\u2014they brought it into the hospital with the three of them, in fact, confirmation of another killer, some made up serial murderer from Europe, as opposed to an alternate dimension.\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s grateful for that. He doesn\u2019t really fancy being cuffed to a hospital bed, it\u2019d be a bit on the nose and it\u2019s not how he likes it to go, typically.\u00a0\n(Steve had laughed at that, the first time he made the joke. Dustin had just scrunched up his face and looked confused.)\nPhysically, Steve got off the best of the three of them. Mentally, not so much. The entire stay at the hospital he refused sleep, the doctors hooking him on the real good stuff without mentioning it until he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes open any longer.\u00a0\nIt didn\u2019t work, though. Vecna\u2019s curse clearly triumphs over all human drugs, because Steve had a couple hours of shut eye until he woke up in complete, screaming, sobbing hysterics.\u00a0\nEddie had clambered into his bed, after that. Had curled up like a wounded dog at his side and listened, casting a hand through his hair as Steve whispered every last horror he\u2019d been shown from start to finish, Eddie unsure whether to be flattered or sickened by his repeated guest appearances.\u00a0\nEddie listens, and realizes that he\u2019d take another life-threatening beating from Jason before having to go through something like that, the way Steve viscerally describes it, sometimes having to pause just to stop himself from heaving again.\u00a0\n(It doesn\u2019t help dissuade Eddie from thinking, just maybe, that Steve might be the most fucking badass guy in the universe.)\nMax is one of the first kids to visit, or maybe they gave her a chance to come and see Steve alone. Either way, Eddie wakes up in the early morning and she\u2019s there, a nasty wound on her neck almost identical to Steve\u2019s, whispering away in hushed voices as Dustin snores lowly and Eddie tries to keep his breath even.\u00a0\nSteve talks through what he saw with her. He sounds a little less aggrieved, but he also can\u2019t bring himself to go into as much detail as he did with Eddie.\u00a0\nEddie feels bad when he\u2019s pleased by that. Mostly because he knows that Steve is trying to spare her, she\u2019s already had her time with Vecna, she doesn\u2019t need the additional nightmare fuel of Steve\u2019s more\u2026 elongated experience.\u00a0\nNancy, Robin, Lucas and Erica come together as a unit. They explain their end of things\u2014the vines that had almost killed the girls, Lucas speaking of the bat that had almost killed Max, showing off his own gnarly scar he got from saving her. Robin speaks in colour and depth about how amazing Nancy\u2019s kill shots were, then gushes about Erica and her total vicious destruction of Vecna\u2019s physical form.\u00a0\nSteve catches Eddie\u2019s eye across the room, and finds himself met with the same fondness for their guests.\u00a0\nThe girl with superpowers comes to make sure that Steve is alive. Their conversation is a bit stilted, no doubt because from what Steve had said, this girl had seen a little too far into his brain\u2014but he gives her a hug nonetheless, thanks her for saving the day. For saving him.\u00a0\nEddie could feel jealous about that, but he doesn\u2019t\u2014because Steve had climbed into his bed, in the middle of the night, wordlessly lying beside him for a while. Then he can\u2019t stop talking, mumbling thank you\u2019s and sorry\u2019s, Eddie finally discerning the strange tinge of Steve\u2019s expressions as guilt. Guilt every time he sees his sling, the bandages around his head, the bandages around his middle.\u00a0\nEddie calls him stupid. They kiss.\n\u00a0\n(Not quite in that order.)\n\u00a0\nDustin goes home, first. Mrs Henderson comes in and fusses over the lot of them, cries, and kisses all three of them on the head until Dustin is so mortified he flees the building entirely.\u00a0\nEddie is discharged alongside Steve by lunchtime.\nSteve can\u2019t drive, so they walk\u2014it\u2019s a long trek, but Eddie feels like they need the air and the space, the time to just be side by side without the threat of death. They\u2019re quiet, and it\u2019s nice, comfortable\u2014their hands are linked and Eddie is thinking about the stupid guilt on Steve\u2019s stupid face and that\u2019s when he calls him stupid, out of the blue.\u00a0\nSteve takes it well\u2014he\u2019s heard it before, mostly because it\u2019s true. He is stupid. Eddie finds it charming.\u00a0\nThey argue playfully, taunting each other until they\u2019re both so worked up they decide that no guilt is allowed for either of them, and Steve lasts not even five seconds before he tries to refute that again\u2014\nSo, naturally, Eddie pins him up against a tree and kisses him. Kisses him in the middle of the forest, bathed in midday light yet also the cool shelter of the thick wildlife above them.\nSteve takes a minute to reciprocate, but Eddie doesn\u2019t take it personally\u2014Steve is sometimes a bit slow on the uptake, even when the uptake is another boy trying to make out with him against a tree. Nonetheless, they get there, and they kiss until Eddie is groaning in pain from his broken and bruised ribs, and Steve is about ninety percent sure that if they continue he\u2019s going to pop some stitches the hospital did their best sewing in over the demobat flesh wounds.\u00a0\nWhen they reach Eddie\u2019s trailer, Steve waits outside.\u00a0\nEddie reunites with his Uncle Wayne\u2014who\u2019s clearly been told to expect him, a suitcase by the door as he sits, stone-faced on the sofa, warmth flooding the lines of age and easing them into pure, unadulterated relief when his nephew finally returns.\u00a0\nInsults fly readily at him, bouncing off of him like the waxy layer on a leaf against rainwater. Eddie is just grinning, crying, and then hugging his old man, who promises he never doubted him, not even for a second\u2014and Eddie believes him, because Nancy Wheeler had told him all about his Uncle Wayne adamantly defending him like his own.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are my own,\u201d He\u2019d said, before making a remark about how Steve was probably going to keel over if Eddie left him outside for much longer.\n(Eddie invites Steve inside.)\n\u00a0\nThey sleep together in the trailer, in Eddie\u2019a bed, a tangle of sore limbs and injured sides, concussed and high on the good stuff Hawkins sent them home with. It\u2019s tender, just a night of lying there in silence with each other, basking in the aftermath of their trauma, their fear.\u00a0\nEddie tells Steve he don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever be okay. Steve says he doesn\u2019t think he will be either.\u00a0\nMaybe they\u2019ll heal together. Maybe they\u2019ll crash and burn, self destruct.\u00a0\nEddie doesn\u2019t think he minds\u2014so long as they do it together.\u00a0"
