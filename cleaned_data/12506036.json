    "text": "\n Ten Year Anniversary Approaches for Class 3-A \n\nTen years ago, twenty teenagers walked through UA\u2019s iron-clad gate as strangers. Three years later, they emerged as experienced and powerful heroes, ready to lead Japan into a new age of heroism. Among them, our current Symbol of Peace: Deku.\n[Image: Class 3-A in robes and caps gathered in front of the UA, arms thrown over each other, smiling at the camera. All of them held their diplomas. Some of them were visibly crying or fighting back tears.]\nIn the lead up to the ten year anniversary of Class 3-A\u2019s formation (officially five months from today), we will be recounting the major events that shaped our heroes of today, staring with the infamous USJ attack in 2XXX.\n\nClick for more.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is the first article in a weekly series about Class 3-A.

His classmates were stacked on top of each other. Todoroki was perched on Midoriya\u2019s right bicep, his face noticeably flushed. Ashido, Kaminari and Sero squashed in together. Ashido\u2019s foot was lodged beneath Bakugou\u2019s chin, and he was reaching for her, a small explosion in his palm. Iida was scolding them. Shinsou\u2019s eyes were closed, and looked as though he was asleep. The rest of their classmates were clutching at each other so they didn\u2019t topple out of the air. Most of them were laughing.

It\u2019s just gone 11PM, but stay tuned: we have an exciting guest star in the studio with us tonight. The very talented, very beautiful, very enchanting\u2014\nCREATI: Stop.\nEARPHONE JACK: The Everything Hero, Creati.\nCREATI: You\u2019re embarrassing me.\nEARPHONE JACK: I\u2019m giving credit where credit is due. Now, this isn\u2019t your first on the show, is it?\nCREATI: I was your first guest, years ago. I was so nervous. I thought I was going to throw up.\nEARPHONE JACK: When we were on live television for the UA sports festival you were fine, but you thought radio was hard?\nCREATI: It\u2019s not that. I wanted your radio show to be a success. I didn\u2019t want to screw anything up for you.\nEARPHONE JACK: This is why you got that nice introduction. My other interviewees aren\u2019t so thoughtful, and\u2014alright, my boss is signalling for me to stop flirting and start in on the proper interview questions.\n[CREATI laughs]\nEARPHONE JACK: Okay, so the villain attack last week\u2014you teamed up with Sugar Rush to rescue the trapped civilians in a really unconventional way. Can you walk us through your thought process there?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was habit to rise with the sun, even on his days off.\nMidoriya ran around the living room looking for his mouthguard and inhaling plain toast, so Todoroki scooped up Barkugou and headed to the balcony. The dog was happy to curl up in his lap and go to sleep. Todoroki ran his fingers through Barkugou\u2019s fur idly, watching the pale sunrise and listening to Midoriya hunt down his wallet and house keys.\nBarkugou snuffled in his sleep and rolled onto his side, his paws pressing into Todoroki\u2019s stomach. Gentle wind disturbed the wind chimes hanging by the door. He closed his eyes and inhaled. Exhaled.\nThe door slid open, and Midoriya stuck his head out. His backpack was thrown over one shoulder, and he was holding a steaming mug of tea.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Midoriya said, voice as quiet as the tingling wind chimes. He handed the tea to Todoroki, who took it and blew on it.\nMidoriya crouched in front of him. His costume\u2019s bulky armour took up too much space on their narrow balcony, but Todoroki leant forward, into Midoriya\u2019s space. Their lips brushed.\n\u201cAlright?\u201d Midoriya said.\n\u201cBetter than.\u201d\n\u201cGood. I thought you were out here brooding on your day off.\u201d\n\u201cThe opposite.\u201d Todoroki fiddled with the mug of tea. Vulnerable declarations were difficult for him, even after all these years. \u201cIt just hit me, for some reason. That I\u2019m here with you. I never thought I\u2019d get to this point, or be this happy, or feel this safe.\u201d\nMidoriya stood and looked down at Todoroki, sleep-soft in pyjama pants and Midoriya\u2019s sweater, Barkugou snoring on his lap, the sunrise casting gentle light over his relaxed features. Midoriya stooped to plant kisses along Todoroki\u2019s hairline.\n\u201cMe neither,\u201d Midoriya admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad realisation, is it? You\u2019ll be okay by yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m okay. You should go before you\u2019re late.\u201d\nMidoriya planted one last kiss on Todoroki\u2019s nose and scratched Barkugou behind the ear before straightening up. \u201cI\u2019ll see you after work. I love you.\u201d\n\u201cI love you, too,\u201d Todoroki said. \u201cBe safe.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[Thumbnail: Two teenagers in the UA sports uniform stood on opposite sides of the arena. One was noticeably blooded and lit up in green electricity. The other was coated in frost. The camera was close enough to show their borderline feral expressions.]\nClass 1-A Todoroki Vs Midoriya - UA Sports Festival 2xxx\n5,058,106 views\n\u00a0\n14,042 Comments\n\u00a0\ndrillbeeautomaton - 3 years ago\nI remember watching this on live tv and being so distressed. i kept thinking the freckled kid was going to break every bone in his body on national tv. i thought he was doing to die. now i\u2019m rewatching this 7 years later and THE FRECKLE KID IS DEKU?\n5k likes\nHide replies^\nyallmight - 3 years ago\nDEKU YOU FUCK\nxelayy - 3 years ago\nI\u2019m suing for emotional distress\n210 likes\nsophistryandsophisms - 3 years ago\nwe should\u2019ve known it was him tbh\n\u00a0\ndistortedecho - 9 months ago\nWhy doesn\u2019t Polarise use his fire side until the end?

His engines were smoking, but his shoulders were squared. He was unwavering.]\nYou always follow the rules, and look down on people who break them. You\u2019re earnest, and a leader, and people often look up to (and you were probably class president in school). You\u2019re loyal to your friends, and have been described as a bit of a mother hen when it comes to their health. You have also been known to talk with your hands.\n\u00a0\nDid you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts? Get started here!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBakugou woke with a start. He reached out, looking for Kirishima, but found only empty air. His heart jackrabbited in his chest, and he had to swallow twice, his mouth dry.\n\u201cKacchan?\u201d\nMidoriya padded out into the living room, and perched on the edge of the coffee table. He\u2019d washed off the soot and sweat, but his face was littered with cuts, some larger than others. His forearm was wrapped in bandages, the skin around his wrist purpled.\n\u201cGo back to sleep,\u201d Bakugou said. His voice was rough, and he didn\u2019t know if it was from sleep or exertion from the fight the day before. He knew, at least, that if he had screamed in his sleep again, Midoriya would be more frantic.\nMidoriya cocked his head to the side and whistled. A moment later, Barkugou wiggled through the cracked bedroom door and raced over, nails clacking against the hardwood floor. When he was close enough, Bakugou scooped the dog up and held him to his chest. Barkugou licked his chin.\n\u201cYou fucker,\u201d Bakugou told the dog. Barkugou wagged his tail and licked him again.\nThey sat there for a while. Barkugou stayed on his name sake\u2019s chest. They both stroked the dog, and waited for Bakugou\u2019s breathing to even out. The night was silent. Midoriya didn\u2019t like to flaunt his acquired wealth, but he and Todoroki both adored the view of the city visible through the wide windows, and their penthouse was high enough that sounds of the traffic below were a distant hum.\nEventually, Bakugou sighed and met Midoriya\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt was Kamino Ward this time,\u201d Bakugou said. \u201cI was chained up that villains\u2019 shit-shack, and then you burst in. Not All Might. You.\u201d\nMidoriya gave Bakugou his full attention. Barkugou huffed impatiently, and burrowed deeper into Bakugou\u2019s warm side.\n\u201cToshinori is fine,\u201d Midoriya said. \u201cThe orchard picking is coming up\u2014we\u2019ll see him then.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the fucking point,\u201d Bakugou growled, the razor-edge of his youth creeping into his voice. Midoriya noted it unflinchingly, and waited for Bakugou to breathe in, to pull himself back together. Bakugou didn\u2019t need to hide behind anger most of the time. He\u2019d grown past that.\n\u201cI\u2019d come for you,\u201d Midoriya said. \u201cIf someone managed to grab you, I wouldn\u2019t stop until\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAre you stupid?\u201d Bakugou kicked him lightly. \u201cI know you would. I\u2019ve known since we were fucking four years old that you\u2019d always be there, running to check up on me.\u201d\nMidoriya nodded, and they shared another moment of quiet. Bakugou hunched his shoulders, and focussed on Barkugou\u2019s fur, a dark blonde in the dim nighttime.\n\u201cIn my dream,\u201d Bakugou began, \u201cyou won, just like All Might did. You were covered in blood, and I could see all the muscles straining in your arms, and then \u2026 you shrunk, like he did. That hand-fucker took your strength, and then left you a shell like\u2014\u201d\nBakugou clenched his hands into trembling fists, and Midoriya finished, \u201cLike All Might.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a shitty nightmare.\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you be happy to be Number One, finally, without me in your way?\u201d Midoriya said in a light tone. Bakugou struck him in the ribs, and Midoriya bent over, winded and spluttering.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get it like that,\u201d Bakugou said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a real victory.\u201d\nThey both heard the afterthought: I barely even want it anymore. Midoriya wouldn\u2019t have guessed that Bakugou would settle so easily into his role as Number Two\u2014a well-respected and terrifying figure in Japanese heroics, but not the Symbol of Peace, not like Deku. But the years have tempered Bakugou in a way Midoriya wouldn\u2019t have thought possible when he was a teenager.\n\u201cI won\u2019t falter,\u201d Midoriya said. The gleam in his eyes was the same here, in Midoriya\u2019s quiet living room, as when he stood in front of villains, in front of the press and scared civilians. It said, I can do this.\nAnd then Midoriya smiled, and it said, It\u2019s alright, because I am here, and I will always be here.\nBakugou blew out a breath, and said, without heat, \u201cYou better not, you fuzzy-haired pissbucket.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want some water?\u201d\nBakugou shook his head, and didn\u2019t tell Midoriya to fuck off, so Midoriya didn\u2019t leave. Instead, he pulled his legs up under him, settling more comfortably on the coffee table.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d Bakugou began, \u201cabout the hero kids.\u201d Midoriya made an interested sound in the back of his throat, so Bakugou went on, \u201cWe went through some fucking awful shit\u2014shit no high schooler should\u2019ve had to deal with. We weren\u2019t prepared for any of it.\u201d\n\u201cAizawa pulled us through it. Toshinori did, too.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know. That\u2019s my point. They knew a little bit about the shit-storm that was coming for us, and they tried to prepare us for it. They didn\u2019t baby us. They\u2019re the reason we became\u2014\u201d Bakugou waved a hand around the apartment, and Midoriya didn\u2019t know if he was gesturing at the apartment bought with Midoriya\u2019s pro hero paycheck; or at the two of them, Japan\u2019s two highest ranking heroes, sitting close to each other and sharing a moment of quiet weakness; or at the world behind the thick windows, where their former classmates were busy leading the world through this time of peace.\nMidoriya wet his cracked lips. \u201cIt was terrible, and there are people I wished I could\u2019ve helped more\u2014like Toshinori, and Mirio, and you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFuck off.\u201d\n\u201cBut \u2026 I didn\u2019t want to be sheltered while people were getting hurt. No matter how young I was, I still wanted to be out there, helping.\u201d\nBakugou gnashed his teeth together. \u201cYou think I didn\u2019t? That\u2019s not what I\u2019m fucking saying, Deku.\u201d\n\u201cThen what\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLook, you think just because we got rid of the League of Villains kids are still safe? You think the fucking baby-faced wannabes UA takes in know what\u2019s out there? What\u2019s coming for them? They don\u2019t. And the next kid they grab might not be as tough or lucky as I was.\u201d\nMidoriya swallowed. \u201cKacchan.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to help them, huh?\u201d\n\u201cAre you saying \u2026 \u201d Midoriya took a deep breath, and said, with resolution, \u201cYou\u2019d make a wonderful teacher. With you there to guide them, those kids would be okay.\u201d\nBakugou rubbed a hand over his face. He looked, suddenly, much older than twenty five, but there was a determined light in his eyes that Midoriya hadn\u2019t noticed before. Bakugou had already made up his mind.\n\u201cFucking damnit,\u201d Bakugou said, mostly to himself.\nMidoriya decided the best thing for them both would be to go back to sleep. He pointed at the floor. \u201cDo you want me to sleep here?\u201d\n\u201cFuck off back to strawberry-shortcake.\u201d Bakugou rolled onto his back, settling Barkugou against his side. The dog curled up there, chin on Bakugou\u2019s ribs. \u201cI\u2019m keeping the dog.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re his favourite, Kacchan,\u201d Midoriya said brightly. Bakugou glowered at him, still a little sore that they had named the clingy fur-ball\u2014a blond Chow Chow, of all things\u2014after him.\n\u201cNext time I\u2019m called to this trash city and have to stay overnight, I\u2019m sleeping outside. In an alley. It would be better than staying here.\u201d\n\u201cWe have so many guest rooms, you could\u2019ve chosen one of those\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI saved your ass today from a bunch of two-bit villains. If I don\u2019t sleep near the door, a fucking burglar will snuff you out, and then I\u2019ll have fucking inter-agency paperwork to complete.\u201d\n\u201cShouto would protect me,\u201d Midoriya said idly, looking Bakugou over again. When he stayed over, Bakugou usually took the guest bedrooms, complaining about the stink of the classmates who had slept there recently. The nights he took the couch, he did so because it was within eyesight of the door and windows\u2014the entrances and exits. \u201cBut maybe I should stay out here and keep Barkugou company, he might miss me\u2014\u201d\nBakugou hurled a throw pillow at him, and Midoriya ducked out of the way. \u201cWhat part of \u2018fuck off\u2019 didn\u2019t you get?\u201d\nMidoriya headed to the bedroom. \u201cI\u2019ll be here in the morning, and the morning after that, and the morning after that. Promise.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever. Goodnight, Deku.\u201d\n\u201cGoodnight, Kaachan.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nminimini-me reblogged the-girl-with-quirks\n\u00a0\ndekudekite:\nok so some of you have been getting confused about class 3-a\u2019s third year at ua, so i\u2019m here to break it down for you. strap in, kids. it\u2019s a fucking wild ride.\n\u00a0\n.\n\u00a0\njustabackgroundcharacter:\nHoly shit.

The pumpkins were a sick green and the size of baseballs, vines curled in tangles around the drenched soil. The tomato plants were wilting and yellow-leaved. The cabbage was dotted with holes; Toshinori must have still been struggling with the beetle infestation.\nThe one-storey country home was Western in design, with sturdy yellow brick and white shingles. Inside was a state of the art heating and cooling system. (Toshinori had mentioned the weather\u2019s impact on his bones, and the next day, the system was ridged up.)\nMidoriya opened the unlocked front door, and made his way through the house. On the kitchen counters was proof that he wasn\u2019t the first person here; jugs of fruit juice and cups were littered by the sink. He was sure that, should he open up the fridge, he\u2019d find a pre-prepared platter of sandwiches and mini cakes of varying states of edibility. Toshinori always made food in preparation of them coming, and he knew Toshinori was trying his hand at baking. He was emailing Inko about his progress. Inko had fondly forwarded the photos of blackened and gooey cupcakes to Midoriya.\nMidoriya let himself out through the backdoor. The flower patches out here faired better than the vegetables. They grew in thick bunches of colour, winding along the rock path and circling the house. The grass was struggling, he noted. Those damned beetles.\nIt was a short walk to the orchard. \u2018Orchard\u2019 was probably a strong term for the dozen apple trees growing wildly at the back of Toshinori\u2019s house. The trees looked healthy. Toshinori stood beneath the biggest tree with a jug of ice water, wearing a floppy, wide-brimmed hat. He put down the jug when he saw Midoriya and came over to meet him.\nThey each attempted to sweep the other in the hug, but Midoriya won that fight, even if Toshinori was still much taller than him. He swept his mentor off his feet.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Bakugou shouted across the orchard. \u201cDon\u2019t break him, fuckstick.\u201d\nMidoriya put Toshinori back down. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d\n\u201cI understand. I know you\u2019re busy protecting Japan.\u201d Toshinori laid a hand on the top of Midoriya\u2019s head, and he felt fifteen years old again. It wasn\u2019t a bad feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, my boy.\u201d\nMidoriya collected several buckets, settling the handles in the crook of his arm. Toshinori made him put on a hat and sunscreen. Then, Midoriya found the tree with the most apples and scaled up the ladder.\nBakugou was already up there, settled on the thickest branch. He had one full bucket, and was busy filling a second. Beneath his baseball cap, Midoriya could tell that his undercut had been freshly shaven.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Midoriya greeted as he set about picking apples and dropping them into his buckets.\n\u201cIt\u2019s after noon,\u201d Bakugou said with disapproval.\nMidoriya shrugged. \u201cHammerhead was trying to smash up the CBD.\u201d\n\u201cYou could take that chump without breaking a sweat. What gives?\u201d\n\u201cPolice processing,\u201d Midoriya said, and Bakugou made a commiserating sound in the back of his throat. The bane of all heroes\u2019 existence: paperwork. \u201cI was off-duty so I didn\u2019t have any sidekicks to help it go faster.\u201d\n\u201cSero is still hoarding Red-Herring,\u201d Bakugou said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want her to know I\u2019m interested in taking her on as a sidekick, \u2018cause he knows I\u2019m the better option and she wouldn\u2019t be able to resist.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s still a student, Kacchan. He doesn\u2019t want her to be traumatised so quickly.\u201d\nBakugou threw an apple at him.\n\u201cCongratulations on the teaching position, by the way. Don\u2019t listen to the press. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to do wonderfully.\u201d\nBakugou rubbed a hand over his face. There was a streak of sunscreen on his nose, where he hadn\u2019t managed to rub it all into his skin. \u201cWhen do I ever listen to what those fuckers have to say?\u201d\n\u201cI guess you can\u2019t take Red-Herring on as a sidekick, now. You might end up teaching her.\u201d\n\u201cDamn. I hadn\u2019t thought about that.\u201d\nThey chatted as they filled their buckets. After a while, Bakugou said, \u201cThe old man looks alright.\u201d\nMidoriya glanced through the branches. Toshinori was at the base of another tree, pouring Asui and Uraraka cups of water and congratulating them on their upcoming award. He was smiling.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good day,\u201d Midoriya said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see his wheelchair when I came in.\u201d\nBakugou shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean physically. He\u2019s not stressed anymore. When he asks about our cases, he\u2019s asking just to ask, not because he\u2019s being obsessive and feeling useless again.\u201d Midoriya stopped picking apples, and gave Bakugou his full attention. His childhood friend stared back, his eyes intent bellow his cap\u2019s worn brim. \u201cHe entrusted the world to us. He did that ages ago, but now, he\u2019s finally come to terms with it.\u201d\nThey lapsed into silence for a moment, thinking that over and watching as Asui pulled a beetle out of Uraraka\u2019s ponytail and Toshinori laughed at Uraraka\u2019s stricken expression.\n\u201cThe ten year anniversary is coming up,\u201d Midoriya said abruptly. \u201cWe should have it here.\u201d\nThere was a bang at the bottom of the tree, and then Kirishima was there, clutching at a branch, legs dangling, laughing his head off. His hair was pulled back from his face with a bandana fastened into a bow under one ear.\n\u201cYoung Kirishima,\u201d Toshinori called. \u201cPut a hat on!\u201d\nBakugou hauled Kirishima up, so he was sitting on the branch instead of hanging off it like a limpet. Kirishima waved his sunhat in the air and then shoved it on. \u201cYes, sir!\u201d\nToshinori waved his thanks, and went to greet Ojiro, who had just arrived.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Kirishima said, stealing a bucket from Midoriya and beginning to fill it with apples, \u201cwhat are we talking about?\u201d\n\u201cThe ten year anniversary,\u201d Midoriya said. \u201cWe were thinking about having it here. Toshinori would like that. He likes seeing us all together.\u201d\nThey delved into plans about the anniversary. Bakugou left to dump off the full buckets and collect empty ones for all of them. When he returned, Midoriya was talking about how overgrown the apple trees were looking.\n\u201cToshinori can\u2019t do a lot of the maintenance on the orchards by himself,\u201d Midoriya said, \u201cmaybe I should\u2014\u201d\nBakugou stabbed a finger at him. \u201cFuck off. Stop worrying.\u201d\n\u201cBakugou prunes the apple trees every year in autumn, right before winter starts,\u201d Kirishima said. \u201cSometimes Sero and I help if we can all get time off.\u201d\nThe class coordinated when they could. With their busy schedules and their love for Toshinori, they worked together to create something beautiful for their mentor, regardless for how he insisted they didn\u2019t need them to put in the effort.\nAfter looking after Japan for almost fifty years, Toshinori deserved to be looked after himself. There was something very right about the former Symbol of Peace being taken care of by the next generation of heroes.\nSato arrived in kaki shorts and a cake tin, holding it up to show off the baked goods. Kirishima cried out and jumped out of the tree, rolling to lessen the impact. Bakugou shouted after him, \u201cWatch your ankle, dumbass! It\u2019s still healing!\u201d\n\u201cSorry, babe!\u201d\nBakugou grumbled under his breath, and Midoriya hid his smile behind a bucket of apples.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nsyrenian reblogged thefierydagger\n\u00a0\n[Gif 1: Deku launched into the air, green energy crackling over him, and punched the side of an abandoned building, creating a swollen explosion of brick, cement, and dust on the other side.

Baking is harder than fighting super-villains\n\u00a0\nInko,\nThank you for the recipe books! I received them in the mail a few days ago. I especially liked the one about healthy sweets. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not very good at cooking. I lived for almost fifty years as both a pro hero and a bachelor - neither very conductive to learning practical skills like cooking. I lived on a lot of pre-bought meals and ramen. Thankfully, young Izuku and Shouto have each other, and you, to keep them from going down that same, bland path.\nAfter several failed attempts, I have been getting the hang of lemonade scones and sponge cake. Mrs. Sugawara gave me some great tips. The people in town all think my abysmal cooking skills are very funny. They\u2019ve spent years watching me fight villains without breaking a sweat, but basic dessert recipes are giving me so much grief. But I am improving, steadily.\nMy former students have been very eager to eat anything I make, regardless of how terrible or burnt it turns out. Young Kirishima wouldn\u2019t listen to my concerns, and took home a batch of rock-hard scones. Apparently Bakugou and he \u201cprefer it crunchy\u201d but I know they were trying to spare my feelings. Izuku has been especially excited to eat my cooking. His smile is still blinding, even when eating blackened eclairs. It hurts to look at him, sometimes, for how bright and young he is.\nEnough about me. How is work? I\u2019m happy to hear that the kids at your daycare have noticed how much you look like Izuku. I\u2019m sure you can convince him to stop by for an afternoon. He is very good with kids. Maybe we\u2019ll have grandchildren in the future? We should start dropping hints.\nAs always, my home is open to you, and I await your next email.\nYours,\nYagi Toshinori\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTodoroki stared intently at his phone screen. Uraraka was seated on a stack of throw pillows on the other side of the coffee table. She noticed his frown, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cAoyama just texted me.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you two were close.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not.\u201d\nAsui lent around the Jenga tower precariously balanced on the coffee table, and squinted at his phone. She read the text, cocking her head to one side. \u201cHe wants you to model his new fashion line?\u201d\n\u201cApparently.\u201d Todoroki\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why.\u201d\nUraraka started laughing, and Iida flapped a hand in the air. \u201cUraraka, it\u2019s impolite to laugh! He may be oblivious to how conventionally attractive he is, but it is our duty as his closest friends to reassure him that he is both worthy of the position and would do an excellent job.\u201d Iida turned to Todoroki and informed him with great solemnity, \u201cYou are worthy of this position and would, in fact, do an excellent job.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d Uraraka said, smothering her laughter with a hand. \u201cI\u2019m not laughing at that. I was just picturing you in Aoyama\u2019s clothes.\u201d\nPuffy blouses and sparkly capes immediately came to mind, and Todoroki winced. He had accompanied Midoriya to Aoyama\u2019s debut fashion show several years back. He had hated every object paraded before him. The starch high-collar tailcoats with rhinestone detailing; the v-neck shirts that dipped almost to the model\u2019s bellybuttons; the puffy sleeves; the glittery capes and curled boots\u2014Todoroki shuddered. There was a reason his hero costume was still a jumpsuit.\n\u201cI would pay to see that,\u201d Asui said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t suit your personality. You would look ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Todoroki said.\nMidoriya chose that moment to bounce out of the kitchen with hot chocolate. He handed a mug to each of them. \u201cWhat are we talking about?\u201d\nTodoroki showed him the phone, and Midoriya\u2019s grimace set Uraraka into peals of laughter again.\n\u201cWhy would he ask me?\u201d Todoroki said. He reached up to touch the scarred half of his face, but Midoriya grabbed his wrist before he could, and dropped a kiss on the dark skin below his eye.\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Midoriya told him, and placed another fluttering kiss over his scarred eyelid. Midoriya pulled back, and, startled, cast a glance at his friends, like he was realising for the first time that they weren\u2019t alone. They smiled indulgently at the two of them. Midoriya stumbled to his feet. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014I have to get the cheesecake.\u201d\nMidoriya raced back into the kitchen with a red face.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had biweekly game night since we were teenagers,\u201d Iida said, \u201cand you two have been openly dating for almost as long, so why does he still get embarrassed about such heartwarming displays?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of his charm,\u201d Uraraka said. She took a gulp of her hot chocolate. She had a milk moustache, and whipped cream smeared over her right cheek. Asui reached over to wipe it off with her thumb, and then popped it in her mouth.\n\u201cAnd you two are completely unaffected,\u201d Iida said.\nUraraka beamed. \u201cI am far stronger than Deku.\u201d\nMidoriya returned with a cheesecake sliced into thick pieces, just in time to catch that remark. He put the cake by the Jenga tower, and dropped sideways on a pillow, tucking his socked feet under Todoroki\u2019s legs. \u201cThat might be true,\u201d he said to Uraraka, \u201cbut there is no way you\u2019re going to beat me at Jenga.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nTransferral of Power: The Rise of Class 3-A\n\nby Hirai Akiko\n\u00a0\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a02\ni.

That is why, when a class of twenty entered UA and emerged less than three years later as Japan\u2019s newest, brightest heroes, the nation was immediately enraptured. A success rate of 100%\u2014aside from Mineta Minoru, who was expelled at the end of his first year and replaced with Shinsou Hitoshi (Mind Blank) at the beginning of the second\u2014was unprecedented. A class having not one, but six heroes in the Top 10 is similarly unheard of. Class 3-A showed the world that they were a determined group of young heroes determined to lead Japan out of a war and into a renewed era of peace.\nIn this paper, I will be deconstructing the events and reasons behind Class 3-A\u2019s success.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGroup Name: aizawa\u2019s angels\nearphone jack: we\u2019re here. where yall at?\ncreati: Kyouka and I are at the bar!\ncellophane: god i wish that were me\ndetonation: what the fuck did i just say abt staying off the chat\ncellophane: gotta blast\nearphone jack: i\u2019d ask but the bakusquad is always sketchy af and i really don\u2019t care\nearphone jack: this place is crawling with snotty fashion people. kill me.\ncreati: Is anyone else here?\ndeku: we\u2019re here!! already sitting down\nuravity: i see you guys!!! you both look really pretty :\u2019))\ningenium: They\u2019re coming our way now, Uraraka.

His long, purple tailcoat swirled with him in a mimicry of his hero costume. \u201cWere you dazzled? Did I blind you with my beautiful creations?\u201d\nJirou gestured at Kaminari with her thumb. \u201cI just want to know why you hired this dumbass.\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m model material,\u201d Kaminari said.\nJirou eyed him. Flatly, she said, \u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m pretty!\u201d\n\u201cYou were satisfactory,\u201d Aoyama allowed. He flounced over to Bakugou and flapped his hands over his attire. Bakugou curled his lip but didn\u2019t start flinging explosions. \u201cBut this\u2014look at this!\u201d\nBakugou stood there, and managed to look more intimidating than usual. The black liner smudged over his lids and the bridge of his nose; the chunky heels; the low-cut tank top, dipping down to his sternum; and the decorative grenades fastened around his wrists, glinting like a disco ball\u2014it was a strange but beautiful replication of his hero costume.\nKirishima laughed at Bakugou\u2019s pinched expression. His own outfit\u2014a harness over his shoulders and back, long gloves and thigh high boots\u2014was less disorderly and a brighter red than his hero costume.\n\u201cHe does look like a model,\u201d Jirou allowed, and then scrunched up her nose like the admission had physically hurt her.\nMidoriya bounced on his heels. \u201cIt\u2019s so clever. The way you melded their hero costumes with high fashion was\u2014was\u2014was so great. Plenty of heroes have been models, but to transfer hero costumes into consumable fashion, especially ones as brash and masculine as Kirishima\u2019s and Kacchan\u2019s, and to display them on heroes unlikely to ever go into modelling\u2014it\u2019s so cool, Aoyama! Very creative!\u201d\nAoyama basked under Midoriya\u2019s praise. He flipped his long hair over one shoulder. \u201cOf course. You understand my vision, Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cI still don\u2019t get it,\u201d Jirou said. \u201cAren\u2019t models supposed to be attractive? But you asked Kaminari?\u201d\n\u201cWhy are we friends?\u201d Kaminari wondered. He sniffed loudly and held a hand to his mouth. Ashido patted him on the shoulder.\n\u201cYou made him cry, you monster,\u201d Sero said. Jirou flipped him off. Kaminari pretended to cry louder. Jirou flipped him off, too.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Bakugou said, \u201cwhat the fuck do you mean unconventional and unlikely to go into modelling? Are you saying I\u2019m not good looking enough?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re very pretty,\u201d Kirishima reassured.\nKirishima went to kiss him, but Bakugou ducked. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing lipstick, dumb-ass!\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cSo? We still have photos to do. I can\u2019t have lipstick all over my face for that.\u201d\n\u201cVain, much?\u201d Jirou asked.\nBakugou bristled. \u201cIf someone hires me to do a job, I\u2019m going to fucking do that job and be the damn best at it. \u201d\n\u201cHe has to be the best at everything,\u201d Jirou said.\nKaminari rubbed at his eye, and Aoyama whacked him over the head. \u201cOw!\u201d\n\u201cDo not ruin your make up.\u201d\nKaminari pouted. Beneath the artificial lights, he was especially glittery. His highlighter was an intense silver, shimmering like electricity every time he turned. His shiny leather pants, his cropped leather jacket, and his silver headpiece caught the light, too.\nSero\u2019s outfit resembled his hero costume the most. He forewent his helmet for an orange mouthguard like Deku\u2019s, showing off his long hair, styled into waves down his shoulder blades.\nAshido admired her fur shawl, shimmery leotard, and dark stockings. \u201cI hate the heels,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I have to say, I think I\u2019m into this? I might have to revise my official costume.\u201d\n\u201cI always liked you best,\u201d Aoyama told her.\nTodoroki took in their glittering, exaggerated costumes, the outrageous heels and teased hair, and looked pained. \u201cIf I had agreed to be in your show, would I look like that?\u201d\n\u201cOi, you offered the job to him?\u201d Bakugou said.\nAoyama shrugged. \u201cHe is very pretty, and his costume would benefit the most from my skills. Honestly, Todoroki, a jumpsuit? After all these years?\u201d\nTodoroki was blank. \u201cIt\u2019s comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cMon Dieu, no! It is a travesty.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n[Image: Third year, cultural festival. Tables and chairs were placed around the gym, ecorated with balloons and coloured tissue paper. Todoroki was in the background, serving a table full of besotted teenager girls. His hair was slicked back, and his butler uniform fit him perfectly. Yaoyorozu was in a long maid uniform off to the side, making extra seats. In the foreground, Ashido and Aoyama had dragged a sheepish Midoriya into posing for the photo. Ashido was wearing a frilly maid uniform. Aoyama was wearing a sparkly purple tailcoat and gloves. Midoriya\u2019s uniform was pulled half on; his bow-tie was lopsided and badly tied, and his suit jacket hung open over his right sling and left wrist brace.\n\nCuts littered their faces. Sutures peaked over Yaoyorozu\u2019s collar. Ashido had a black eye. Midoriya\u2019s injuries were the worse; his right jaw was purpled, a cut on his chin, and his fingers wrapped were bandages. But they were all safe. They were taking a day to celebrate winning a three year long war by being teenagers enjoying their final cultural festival. Midoriya\u2019s brace was full of signatures and sketches and stickers. They were all smiling.]\nuaclass1a\n82,113 likes\nPlease come down to the joint Class 1-B &amp; Class 3-A cafe for the UA Cultural Festival!

With his pigmented hair, sharp teeth, and with Bakugou at his side, he was easy to spot. Kirishima didn\u2019t mind; it was nice to see other people\u2019s enthusiasm, and it made him feel a little like he was giving something back to his fans. Even though Bakugou grumbled his way through most of his fan encounters and outright swore at the ruder ones, Kirishima knew he didn\u2019t hate it as much as he pretended.\nBakugou finished patrol before sunset, and Kirishima didn\u2019t start night shift for several hours, so they went out for an early dinner. Bakugou shoved a baseball cap over his spiky hair, but other than that, neither of them bothered to wear disguises.\nBakugou was halfway through his beer and a story about Kaminari knocking himself out with his own quirk when a crowd of middle schoolers descended upon them. They weren\u2019t shy about approaching two pro heroes, but were polite about interrupting their meal, so Bakugou didn\u2019t tell them to fuck off.\nA tall boy with pink hair held out his notebook and dropped into a quick bow. \u201cCan we please have your autographs?\u201d\nBakugou snatched up the book and scrawled his name in huge letters, barely leaving enough room for Kirishima to squish his name into one corner. The other kids scrambled for their own books. A quick round of autographs, and another set of thank you\u2019s, and then the kids left. They could see them celebrating through the restaurant window, high-fiving and jumping about.\n\u201cSo young,\u201d Kirishima said, placing a hand over his heart.\n\u201cPiss off,\u201d Bakugou said. \u201cYou\u2019re not that much older than they are.\u201d\nKirishima smiled. \u201cYou were almost polite to them.\u201d\nBakugou gestured at the mostly empty restaurant. The middle schoolers had only noticed them because they were passing through to say hello to a friend working in the kitchens. \u201cI\u2019ve learnt that the sooner you sign their shit, the sooner they leave you alone. And besides, they\u2019re just kids.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you said we weren\u2019t that much older than them?\u201d\n\u201cTen years isn\u2019t that big of a gap, but it matters when you\u2019ve been through what we\u2019ve been through,\u201d Bakugou said, and while he was distracted looking at the middle schoolers with an unreadable, almost nostalgic expression, Kirishima stole his beer.\nBakugou swiped for his beer, but Kirishima held it above his head. \u201cHey, give that back, moron! You\u2019ve got patrol soon.\u201d\n\u201cOne mouthful won\u2019t do anything!\u201d\nThrough the restaurant window, the middle schoolers started shouting. Bakugou stopped scolding Kirishima and together, they watched as the kids flagged down another middle schooler from across the street. He wasn\u2019t especially remarkable\u2014he didn\u2019t have pink hair or skeletal wings or inverted eyes like the other boys, and he wasn\u2019t as loudly enthusiastic. But there was something very focussed about his eyes. Something they almost recognised.\nOne of the girls said something. She turned and pointed at Kirishima and Bakugou, and when the newcomer saw them, his face went ashen. They all shouted at him, but he shook his head frantically. He looked terrified.\n\u201cYou think they\u2019re bothering him?\u201d Kirishima asked. They seemed like good kids, but, well. You could never be sure.\nBakugou watched the exchange with narrowed eyes. He\u2019d been a loud advocate for anti-bullying (and, alongside Midoriya, quirkless kids) for nearly five years now, and was the first to jump in when kids got too rough with one another.\nAfter another round of prodding, the boy drew in a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and marched into the restaurant. He hesitated when he saw them, but took another breath and barged on.\nHe sunk into a low bow when he was close, turned towards Kirishima. \u201cMy name is Nishiyama, and you\u2019re my idol! I want to get stronger so I can be a dependable hero, just like you.\u201d\nKirishima turned to Bakugou with raised eyebrows. Bakugou took a sip of his beer, and remained silent.\n\u201cMy quirk is endurance,\u201d Nishiyama went on. \u201cIt\u2019s boring, and it\u2019s not flashy, and I\u2019m not brave enough to rush into danger, but \u2026 but I want to be! I want to be that type of person. I\u2019m going to go to UA and become brave, just like you.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you should dye your hair,\u201d Bakugou said.\nThe boy blinked. He looked hurt for a moment, like Bakugou was mocking him, but Kirishima said, \u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t remarkable either.\u201d\nThe boy faltered. \u201cBut you\u2019re \u2026 \u201d\n\u201cI always through my quirk wasn\u2019t flashy enough as well, but I remade myself; I dyed my hair and decided to become the kind of person others could depend on. You\u2019re just like me.\u201d He smiled, showing off his sharp teeth. \u201cAnd with that vow, you\u2019ve already taken a step to becoming a hero, Nishiyama.\u201d\nNishiyama pressed a hand to his chest, right over his heart \u201cYou believe in me?\u201d\n\u201cYeah! Your declaration was super manly. You\u2019ve got a huge heart and more than enough determination\u2014I can see it in your eyes.\u201d Kirishima raised a fist. The boy swallowed, and shakily knocked his own fist against Kirishima\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be great, Nishiyama.\u201d\nThe boy\u2019s hand flew to his mouth to stifle a sob. He stood like that for a moment, shoulders shaking, working to get his breathing under control and fight back tears. Kirishima wanted to get up and wrap him in a hug, but with a discreet hand gesture, Bakugou stopped him. Let him have his pride, Bakugou\u2019s eyes said. So they waited.\nNishiyama lowered his hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nHe asked for their autograph, and this time, Kirishima wrote:\n\nNishiyama, I look forward to working with you one day! \u2014 Red Riot\n\nHe signed his name with a giant flourish and Bakugou left his own name as a small afterthought in the corner.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Nishiyama said again, in a daze. He flicked a gaze over to Bakugou, as though realising for the first time that Kirishima wasn\u2019t the only pro hero seated at the table.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you at UA,\u201d Bakugou said.\nNishiyama left. The middle schoolers waiting for him at the front of the restaurant enveloped him in a round of hugs and hair tussles, and this time, Nishiyama returned them with a furious grin. He thrust the autograph into the air and shouted something that made other pedestrians stop and stare at the kid.\nKirishima had never felt so shaken by a fan encounter before.\n\u201cI wonder what he\u2019ll be,\u201d Bakugou said. \u201cBlue Riot? Magenta Riot? Rainbow Riot?\u201d\n\u201cRainbow Riot would be so badass,\u201d Kirishima said, but it came out quieter and more choked up than he\u2019d wanted. It happened less and less as he grew older, as he became accustomed to life as a hero, but every now and then, it would hit him all at once. What he\u2019d done. Where he was. The fact that there were little kids who watched him with the same rapt attention he had once focussed on Crimson Riot, and thought, This is what a hero should be. This is what I want to become.\n\u201cGod,\u201d Kirishima said.\nBakugou reached across the table and took Kirishima\u2019s hand in his own. Kirishima gripped back tightly.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\ntheamazingspiderteen reblogged sabs-cat\n\u00a0\nsabs-cat:\n\nSab's Fic Recs\n\nYou guys keep asking for Heroic RPF recs and I finally got off my ass and made a completed list. Most of these are Class 3-A because I\u2019m shameless and obsessed and love these kids with all my heart.\nFor people new to hero RPF, most writers use their real names in fics, rather than their hero aliases. This can make it tricky getting into fic if you\u2019re not a diehard fan, since you\u2019re new to most of the names. To make it easier, I\u2019m going to use hero names in my notes. Happy reading!\n* is for old fics. \u2605 is for personal favourites.\n\u00a0\n\u2605 Forged by the Flames by Sifuhotman\nPairing: Detonation/Red Riot\nWord count: 230k\nRating: M\nSummary: From first year to graduation: sports festivals, kidnappings, and blossoming friendship - and love.\nNotes: A novel-length fic that follows Detonation/Red Riot through their time at UA. Sifuhotman has an amazing handle on her characters and their development. They feel really young and distant in the beginning (weird to read Class 3-A as 15yo strangers), and then later, as they\u2019re shaped by experience and trauma, they grow more mature and reach out to the people around them. Intense slow burn. Angsty in places. Great mix of other characters too! Bakusquad messing with obliviously-in-love!Detonation/Red Riot was hilarious.\n\u00a0\nblow the whistle by lucylucylue\nPairing: Froppy/Uravity\nWord count: 13k\nRating: T\nSummary: The word goes mute. The kids screaming by the poolside, Iida scolding Todoroki to put on his sunscreen, the splashing water - Uraraka hears none of it. Sees none of it. Because there, atop the tall lifeguard chair, is the cutest girl she\u2019s ever seen.\n\nLifeguard AU\n\nNotes: The cutest Froppy/Uravity I\u2019ve ever read. Loved the background Dekusquad too.\n\u00a0\nOn The Air by queenscream\nPairing: Earphone Jack/Creati\nWord count: 3k\nRating: E\nSummary: A hand slides up her calf, over her knee, and slides towards her crotch. Jirou jumps, and almost bumps the mic. She looks down, and there, folded beneath the desk, is Yaoyorozu, blinking up at her with dark eyes and a small, innocent smile.\n\n\u201cOne minute until air,\u201d calls her assistant.\n\nNote: Obligatory on air PWP. We\u2019ve all read at least one.\n\u00a0\n* burn the world by severen\nPairing: Detonation/Deku\nWord count: 45k\nRating: E\nSummary: Bakugou pulled Midoriya closer, teeth barred in a feral grin. Midoriya\u2019s heart raced. He had seen the villain on TV, but he was more frightening up close, pressed against Midoriya\u2019s body. Bakugou laughed, and Midoriya shuddered as the rough sound reverted through his chest.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going, little bunny?\u201d\n\nNote: Villain!Detonation, still-a-hero!Deku. Kind of fucked up, but very hot. Detonation has very little morals here, and is pretty unhinged.

He was careful not to step on anyone\u2019s dress, and kept his date close. Their arms were linked, and he could feel how she was shaking through his suit jacket. Both excitement and nerves, he thought. She was more composed than he had been during his first hero ball. The ball after he was named Number One was the worst; he had thought he was going to throw up on someone.\nNakao, a bubbly reporter in a sequin dress, waved him down. Midoriya steered his date out of the crowd and towards her and the cameraman.\n\u201cDeku, hello! You look so handsome,\u201d Nakao said. \u201cWho are you wearing?\u201d\nMidoriya quickly cycled through the obligatory questions. Nakao let him speed through them, just as eager to get to the meat of the interview. Finally, with a friendly but intense expression, Nakao asked, \u201cAnd who is your date for this evening?\u201d\n\u201cThe most beautiful woman in Japan,\u201d Midoriya said.\nInko battered at Midoriya\u2019s arm. He laughed, and she pressed a hand to her reddening cheeks. \u201cOh, stop that, Izuku!\u201d\n\u201cThis is my mum,\u201d Midoriya told Nakao. \u201cShe was kind enough to accompany me tonight.\u201d\n\u201cMrs. Midoriya,\u201d Nakao said, \u201cis this your first time attending a hero ball? How are you finding it?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched dozens of them over the years\u2014first with Izuku when he was a kid and desperate to see All Might, and then every year after he started attending them himself.\u201d She tipped a teary smile at Midoriya, and squeezed his arm. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of him.\u201d\n\u201cMum!\u201d Midoriya shrunk into his suit jacket, blushed. It would be obvious to everyone watching where Deku inherited his dark curls and flushed cheeks.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been preparing for this for years,\u201d Inko said mercilessly. She opened her clutch purse and pulled out a stack of photos.\u00a0Midoriya squeaked. Inko ignored him, and asked Nakao, \u201cWould you like to see some baby photos?\u201d\nNakao stared at the photos ravenously, as though, instead of glossy paper, she could see the potential viewer count. It wasn't every day the Number One hero was embarrassed by his gushing mother on national TV.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Nakao said.\nInko extracted a photo and handed it over. Nakao examined it with awe and then held it up to the camera. Midoriya\u2019s blush deepened.\n\u201cHe was All Might\u2019s biggest fan. His whole room was decked out with red, blue and yellow merchandise.\u201d Inko studied her son for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s changed, actually.\u201d\nBoth women turned to Midoriya. He coughed into his fist. \u201cIt\u2019s important to support fellow heroes,\u201d he said, and was proud that his voice barely wobbled.\n\u201cWould you like to see a photo of him and Katsuki? They used to take baths together when they were little.\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki?\u201d Nakao said with feral delight. \u201cAs in, Detonation? The Number Two hero?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to die,\u201d Midoriya decided. Both women ignored him in favour of rifling through the photos, periodically holding them up to the camera. Midoriya was developing a cold sweat on the back of his neck. Down the other end of the red carpet, several of his ex-classmates were making their way towards them.\nThere was no way this could end well.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDeku\u2019s Mother Wows Fans with Baby Photos\u2026\nwww.dailymail.com\u2026/deku\u2019s-mother-wows-fans-with-baby\u2026\n5 hours ago - Although Hero Deku is usually accompanied by No. 4 Polarise, this year his date for the annual Hero Ball was his mother!

She drew back, lips pursed. \u201cYou\u2019re far too warm \u2026 \u201d\n\u201cWhich side did you kiss?\u201d Midoriya asked. He handed Todoroki a glass of water, and pressed his own kiss to Todoroki\u2019s head.\n\u201cThe ice side. Have you taken the cold tablets, honey?\u201d\nTodoroki blinked lazily at her. \u201cYes. I\u2019m fine, Inko. How was the ball?\u201d\nShe looked him over once more before deciding he was going to live, and then beamed. \u201cOh, it was so exciting! But also scary. Seeing so many pros all dressed up\u2014it was so nerve-wracking. I thought I was going to pass out. It was so fancy.\u201d\n\u201cBut you had a good time?\u201d\nInko pulled her sheer shawl off her shoulders, and brushed back her curls so she could take out her earrings. \u201cI had an excellent time. Everyone was so nice.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what the news said,\u201d Todoroki said, smiling.\nMidoriya rubbed at his temples. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think we were properly fighting, did they? I don\u2019t want anymore \u2018Class 3-A secretly hate each other\u2019 conspiracies to get out.\u201d He adopted a fierce expression he usually saved for talking about heroics. \u201cI love my friends.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Todoroki said. \u201cThey could tell it was more mock-fighting than anything serious. Well, aside from Bakugou, but everyone knows that he is \u2026 \u201d\n\u201cFiery?\u201d Midoriya offered.\n\u201cA little asshole?\u201d Inko asked, with the delicate air of someone who had forgiven a man for bullying her son for over ten years, but couldn\u2019t help the vague dislike lurking in her heart.\n\u201cMum!\u201d\n\u201cCan I see the photos again?\u201d Todoroki asked. \u201cThere are copies online, but it doesn\u2019t beat the origins.\u201d\n\u201cThere are photos online?\u201d Midoriya said weakly. He dropped into the armchair. His loose bow tie hung around his neck, and his sleeves were pushed up to his elbows. Even rumpled and embarrassed, he was exceptionally handsome. Todoroki made himself focus on the photos Inko handed him. You are sick and your future mother-in-law is staying the night, he reminded himself. Pure thoughts.\n\u201cI should\u2019ve shown you years ago, Shouto,\u201d Inko said.\nTodoroki flicked through the baby photos: Midoriya dressed as All Might for halloween; Midoriya pressed against the computer monitor, an All Might action figure clutched in his fist, eyes shining as he watched All Might haul people out of the smoking wreckage; Midoriya and Bakugou running through sprinkles, their bare butts winking in the sunlight; Midoriya sleeping on the ground, All Might action figure in one hand and Bakugou\u2019s lax hand in the other; Midoriya, paint smeared all up his arms and over his cheeks, holding up a drawing of two stick figures in capes, labelled All Might + Small Might!\n\u201cI can die happy,\u201d Todoroki said. He flipped to the next photo. It was labelled, Izuku\u2019s first day of school! He pressed the photo to his chest. \u201cSo it\u2019s true: your smile was always blinding.\u201d\nInko nodded seriously, and Midoriya chucked a throw pillow at Todorki\u2019s head. \u201cStop. You sound like Uraraka.\u201d\n\u201cI saw how delighted she was to discover the photos,\u201d Todoroki said. \u201cThey were all pretty excited, actually. Although it was strange to watch you chase down our friends on the red carpet. Who knew Ashido could move like that in stilettos.\u201d\n\u201cTheir training is too good,\u201d Midoriya said. \u201cBefore I knew it, the photos had been passed around by our entire class. Five different heroes had to stop Bakugou from destroying both me and the photos.\u201d\nInko looked thoughtful for a moment, and then pulled out her phone. \u201cI should call Mitsuki. I\u2019m sure she would want to put her own baby photos of Bakugou online.\u201d\nTodoroki nodded. \u201cLet me know when she\u2019s done so. I\u2019ll retweet them to my official account.\u201d\nMidoriya stared at his family with horror. \u201cAre you two trying to get me killed?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDirect message\nKacchan: WHAT THE FUCK, DEKU\nKacchan: on LIVE TV?? really??\nKacchan: i\u2019m going to fucking kill you\nKacchan: i\u2019m going to throw you into the fucking sun, you green haired cry baby bitch\nKacchan: and also is icyhot ok?\nDeku: shouto is still under the weather, but he\u2019s getting better. my mum\u2019s helping me look after him.\nKacchan: are we still doing lunch tomorrow then?\nDeku: yup! I\u2019ll be at your office around 1 :)\nDeku: are we working on paperwork again? i\u2019m behind\u2026\nkacchan: yup. bring work over.\nKacchan: and don\u2019t be late this time\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo: [email\u00a0protected]\nFrom: [email\u00a0protected]\nSubject: You\u2019re the only halfway competent hero from that hell class\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to tell you to be careful with your increasing fame. You're limited when criminals know, ahead of time, what you can do. Maybe you should consider taking a break and letting your fame die down.\nMany students\u00a0with non-offensive quirks that can't pass the UA hero exam\u00a0are shoved into Gen. Studies. I can\u2019t help them from where I am. It\u2019s time UA took on someone who can.\nThink about it.\n\u2014 Aizawa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQuiz: Which Pro Hero Are You?\n\u00a0\n\nYou Got: Polarise\n\n[Gif: Todoroki stared at the reporters bothering him in the aftermath of a fight, steam drifting around his legs. The ice coating the street melted, slowly. Todoroki was untouched, save for a small rip in his jumpsuit.]\nYou\u2019ve been described as \u201cpretty but deadly.\u201d You come across as cold and aloof, but you warm up around your friends. You don\u2019t let people intimidate or push you around. You\u2019re calm and stay composed even while everyone around you is falling to pieces. And you probably have a thing for strong boys with big curls and bigger smiles.\n\u00a0\nDid you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts? Get started here!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey met at Bakugou office to have lunch. Bakugou would start at UA soon, and they probably wouldn\u2019t get to see each other as often. Or maybe Midoriya could visit him at UA. He might get swamped by students, but he liked talking to fans.\nWhen Bakugou saw him, he sighed the same sigh he used when the police sent over extra paperwork, and sent one of the interns out to collect lunch.\n\u201cKacchan, you shouldn\u2019t use your interns like servants. They\u2019re here to learn about how to be a hero.\u201d\nBakugou lifted a cardboard box full of files onto his desk with thud. Midoriya dropped his backpack next it, and started unloading his own folders.\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk about shit you don\u2019t understand, Deku. And close the damn door.\u201d\nMidoriya closed the door. He grabbed a chair and pulled it closer to the desk. Bakugou collapsed into his own chair.\nThey only finished a handful of folders each, before there was a tentative knock at the door. Midoriya put down his pen. Bakugou told the door, \u201cCome.\u201d\nAn intern pushed open the door. His face was a deep red, and he was shaking, the stack of pizzas threatening to tip right out of his arms. He flicked a glance between the two heroes, and made a sound like a dog being stepped on when he locked eyes with Midoriya for a second.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Midoriya said, getting out of his chair, \u201clet me help you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSit down,\u201d Bakugou said in a voice that brooked no argument. \u201cMarco, get it together.\u201d\n\u201cUh,\u201d Marco said, \u201cuh, yes. Yes, sir. I just\u2014\u201d\nBakugou swept the pizzas from his intern\u2019s arms, and waved at the door. \u201cOut you go.\u201d\n\u201cRight, I\u2019ll just\u2014but wait, I wanted to\u2014I want to tell\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo. Out.\u201d\nBakugou used his free hand to whirl Marco around, and shove him out of the office. He shut the door behind him, and locked it.\n\u201cThat was a little mean,\u201d Midoriya said.\nBakugou put the pizzas on his desk. Grease was already dampening the bottom of the cardboard, but he didn\u2019t remove the paperwork caught under the boxes. Bakugou flipped open the lid, and shoved a slice between his teeth. Midoriya grabbed a piece, too. He barely winced at the intense spiciness.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a kid,\u201d Midoriya said through bites of pizza.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fan,\u201d Bakugou bit out. \u201cA big fucking fan. Of you.\u201d Midoriya blinked at him and nibbled at his pizza, and Bakugou rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re here to catch up on paperwork, not to be gawked at.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Midoriya said, and then again, \u201cOh.\u201d He put down his half-eaten slice. \u201cKacchan, I don\u2019t mind. Your interns don\u2019t bother me. I don\u2019t come here because it\u2019s quiet or anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou come for the free food. You\u2019re as bad as your freezer burn boyfriend.\u201d\n\u201cFianc\u00e9,\u201d Midoriya corrected idly. \u201cAnd no, actually. I come here for you.\u201d Bakugou stared at him over the heaping piles of paperwork and the greasy pizza, and Midoriya smiled like they were four years old again, ready for another day of bug hunting and make-believe hero-ing. \u201cBecause you\u2019re my friend, and I don\u2019t get to spend enough time with you.\u201d\nBakugou picked up another slice of pizza, and then a second, and then a third, and tried to jam all of them into his mouth at once. He managed it, too. His cheeks were swollen, and the skin was shiny and tight. He breezed in through his nose as he tried not to drown in the cheese.\nMidoriya stood up. \u201cI\u2019m going to give that kid my autograph, and then I\u2019ll be right back. I want to hear how your prep for the school year is going.\u201d\nBakugou flipped him off. Midoriya beamed, and returned the crude gesture. In the bullpen, Marco saw Bakugou\u2019s door open, saw Midoriya exit the office and make a beeline for him with a friendly smile, and started crying.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo: [email\u00a0protected]\nFrom: [email\u00a0protected]\nSubject: Re: Re: These little shits\nYoung Bakugou,\nIt\u2019s your first semester as a teacher, don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. I felt lost during my entire career at UA (to be fair, thought, you were an exceptionally difficult class). This doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a bad teacher or that you\u2019re \u201cnot cut out for this,\u201d as you said. It just means you\u2019re new to this. The kids are probably intimidated by you and/or feel like they have something to prove. Remember your first year at UA. You were a terror.\nI\u2019m very happy to hear you\u2019ve been talking with Aizawa. That man is one of the finest teachers UA has ever had. He\u2019s also incredibly realistic. He wouldn\u2019t have hired you if he didn\u2019t think you could do this, and do it incredibly well.\nI\u2019m sent an old textbook of mine in the mail. You should receive it sometime this week. Don\u2019t dismiss it immediately (or blow it up). I know you\u2019re not a dummy, but that doesn\u2019t mean \u201cTeaching for Dummies\u201d isn\u2019t very helpful.\nThe apples from this years orchard pickings are running out faster than usual. I fear it\u2019s because of all the botched apple pies I\u2019ve made. Baking is incredibly hard, even if Inko has been messaging me lots of support and advice. I just want to get it right for when I see everyone next.\nAnd yes, you don\u2019t need to ask: you and young Kirishima are always welcome to come down for a weekend (or longer) and keep an old man company, even if you have more teaching stories than hero stories to tell me. You\u2019re both welcome to my failed apple pies.\nKeep your head up. Plus ultra.\nRegards,\nYagi Toshinori\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Top 8 Heart-warming Friendship Moments Between Class 3-A \n\nIn honour of the Class 3-A\u2019s upcoming anniversary, we\u2019ll be recounting our Top 8 friendship moments. They might be fearless pro heroes, but they\u2019re also close-knit friends.\n\u00a0\n\n8. When Earphone Jack launched Charge Bolt off a bridge for making a pun\n\n[Gif: Kaminari flailed in a shallow river. Jirou leant over the bridge railing above, howling with laughter]\nThis one might be more violent than expected for high school friends, but who hasn\u2019t wanted to throw their friend off a bridge for making a terrible pun?\n\u00a0\n\n7. When Polarise and Deku named their dog after Detonation\n\n[Gif: Todoroki tweeted a photo of Bakugou and Barkugou asleep on the couch, the dog curled on Bakugou\u2019s chest, with the caption: Two sleeping mutts.]\nWhen Polarise and Deku moved in together, no one expected them to name their recently adopted Chow Chow \u201cBarkugou\u201d after their former classmate, Bakugou Katsuki (Detonation).\n\u00a0\n\n6. When Charge Bolt, Cellophane, and Red Riot spotted each other across the street and ran to meet each other\n\n[Gif: Kaminari and Sero spotted each other across the battlefield and visibly lit up. They ran across the street and crashed into a hug. Kirishima jumped into frame, sweeping both heroes into bone-cracking hugs, their feet leaving the asphalt.]\nUnplanned team ups are good, but we prefer unexpected friendship meets up. So cute!\n\u00a0\n\n5. Class 3-A supporting Polarise during Endeavour\u2019s divorce case\n\n[Gif: Heroes in professional attire stood like a blockage in front of Todoroki, stopping the feral crowd of reporters from swarming or photographing him. Bakugou was snarling, and looked minutes away from punching someone out. Shouji was an towering and immovable wall. Under Iida\u2019s arm, Midoriya could be seen holding tightly to an obscured Todoroki\u2019s hand.]\nThe infamous Endeavour court case is more somber than we could normally include here (especially considering the allegations of child abuse that arose on the second day of the trial), but the way twenty heroes descended upon the court house to support their former classmate and protect him from the media was too heart-warming to skip.\n\u00a0\n\n4. When Prince Charming included his former classmates in his recent fashion show\n\n[Gif: Ashido strutted down the runway amid flashing cameras. She didn\u2019t stumble in her tall heels. Kaminari was behind her, his costume glittering like a disco ball.]\nWho would\u2019ve thought Detonation would make such a good model?\n\u00a0\n\n3. When Ingenium stopped a press conference so he could scold Uravity and Deku about their eating habits\n\n[Gif: Heroes lined up behind a long table, Iida in the middle. He chopped his arm in the air with increasing vigour. Midoriya shrunk in his seat. Uraraka rubbed at the back of her head, and tried to make excuses. The other heroes looked bewildered.]\nWe can\u2019t even remember how this came up in the middle of a professional press conference, but we DO know that we love Ingenium worrying about his friends\u2019 heath. Momma Ingenium FTW.\n\u00a0\n\n2. When Class 3-A (then Class 2-A) waited for Mind Blank to sit his provisional license exam, and then LOST IT when he came out and told them he\u2019d passed\n\n[Gif: Class 3-A swarmed around Shinsou, and lifted him into the air. Shinsou pretended to look annoyed, but a small smile pulled at his lips. Aizawa was in the background, watching on. Midoriya was crying openly.]\nClass 3-A received their provisional licenses in their first year, but as Mind Black didn\u2019t join Class 3-A until the beginning of second year, he had to take the exam by himself. Lucky for him, the rest of the class wasn\u2019t going to let him go alone.\n\u00a0\n\n1. Deku calling Detonation \u201cKacchan\u201d \u2026 and Detonation letting him\n\n[Gif: Midoriya was greeting fans at a publicity event. He saw something over the top of the crowd, and lit up. He cupped his hands to his mouth, and called, \u201cKacchan!\u201d]\nDeku has always, without hesitation, called Detonation this cutesy nickname. And Detonation answers to it every time.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo: [email\u00a0protected], [email\u00a0protected], [email\u00a0protected], + 18 more\nFrom: [email\u00a0protected]\nSubject: Anniversary Celebrations\nHello, everyone!\nAs our real anniversary is fast approaching (Monday next week, if I am correct) I thought it appropriate to email and remind everyone about our celebrations that will take place in five weeks time.

We are all long-time friends with a great deal of respect for one another, and we are gathering to celebrate this. Please\u00a0desist this antagonising behaviour!\nI will see you all soon.\nYour friend,\nIida Tenya\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey held the reunion almost a month past the actual date. The media had been ramping up attention on their class for months, and on the real date of their ten year anniversary, there were scores of villain attacks across the country. All of them worked through the real date of their reunion, and told no one about their upcoming plans.\nWeeks later, when the hype of their anniversary had died down, they each donned civilian clothes and made their way to the countryside. It was hard to organise an event for twenty pro heroes, but they had planned almost a year in advance.\nMidoriya didn\u2019t make it to the party until that evening, when the sun was beginning to sink below the grassy hills, painting the idyllic town in shades of pink. Kaminari and Ashido met him at the door and swept him up into big hugs. Their wine glasses were almost empty, and, from the coherence of their hellos, Midoriya guessed that it was not their first or even second drink for the day.\nToshinori\u2019s backyard had been transformed. Christmas lights wrapped around the orchard trees, and tiny stake lights paved the way from the house to the outside party, spread out beneath the stars, visible without any city light pollution. Chairs and blankets were laid out, with a large space off to the side left for dancing. Music echoed around them. Toshinori\u2019s neighbours were far off, and even if the volume of twenty excitable heroes reached them, they had been pre-warned.\nMidoriya kissed Todoroki on the cheek, and then got pulled into a dozen different hugs. If Toshinori had his strength, his hug would\u2019ve lifted Midoriya clear off his feet.\nAizawa was leaving as Midoriya made his way out into the garden, wanting to catch the last train back to the city. He stopped briefly to let Shinsou wrap him in a one-armed hug, the two heroes whispering something to one another that Midoriya didn\u2019t catch, and then came to talk to Toshinori, who saw him coming and tried to hide a beer behind his back.\n\u201cIt\u2019s for young Bakugou,\u201d Toshinori began.\n\u201cDon\u2019t even try,\u201d Aizawa said, confiscating the beer. He turned to Midoriya. \u201cI can trust him with you?\u201d\nMidoriya, who spoke to Toshinori\u2019s fleet of doctors perhaps more regularly than Toshinori himself did, nodded. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m a grown man!\u201d\n\u201cI worry,\u201d Midoriya said. \u201cLast time you tried to sneak a beer, you ended up vomiting all night.\u201d\nToshinori laid a hand on Midoriya\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for making you worry like that, but it\u2019s a tradition for a man to have a beer with his son. I didn\u2019t want to miss out on that because of my health.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d Aizawa said when Midoriya\u2019s eyes grew misty. Midoriya didn\u2019t listen. Toshinori pulled him into a hug, and let him wet his cotton t-shirt with his tears. Aizawa sighed. \u201cStill such a problem child.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe party lasted well into the night. Everyone slept in the backyard, sprawled on the grass in sleeping bags and mounds of pillows.\nIida, who didn\u2019t enjoy drinking much, and Midoriya, who had an inhuman metabolism, bounced into the kitchen to cook breakfast at sunrise. Neither of them were brilliant cooks\u2014no one there really was\u2014but they were the most awake and least likely to burn down Toshinori\u2019s house.\nBakugou stumbled out of the garden and into the kitchen sometime later, one side of his hair flattened. He narrowed his eyes at them.\nMidoriya beamed. \u201cKacchan, good morning. Hungry?\u201d\nBakugou grunted. \u201cBacon?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re just finishing up the eggs,\u201d Iida began, but Bakugou ignored him. He bypassed all other breakfast food laid out on the table, and scooped up the entire tray of bacon for himself.\n\u201cCoffee?\u201d Bakugou asked. Midoriya pointed at the coffee machine. Bakugou made two mugs of double-strength coffee, and took them, along with the bacon, out into the backyard. Distantly, they heard Kirishima sleepily cry, \u201cIs this bacon? Babe, marry me.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re already married, dumbass.\u201d\nThe others made their way into the kitchen slowly. Tokoyami shambled in with his sleeping bag wrapped around him like his hero costume. Midoriya slid over a stack of chocolate pancakes and maple syrup, and Tokoyami said, very solemnly, \u201cMidoriya, I always knew you were the best of us\u2014an untarnished beacon of light that chases away the darkness lurking in men\u2019s hearts.\u201d\n\u201cVery poetic, Tokoyami,\u201d Iida said, a little awkwardly.\nMidoriya handed him a mug of tea, too, and Tokoyami told him, \u201cI would die for you.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t,\u201d Midoriya said.\nYaoyorozu entered, busily braiding her knotted hair. Jirou followed, bleary-eyed, hanging on to the back Yaoyorozu\u2019s dressing gown.\n\u201cWhy is Tokoyami dying for you?\u201d Yaoyorozu asked with concern.\nMidoriya handed them each a cup of coffee. Jirou accepted hers with a sleepy, \u201cFuck, I\u2019d die for him, too.\u201d\n\u201cKyouka!\u201d\n\u201cBabe, relax.\u201d Jirou leant up to kiss Yaoyorozu, missed her lips, and planted one on her nose. Yaoyorozu looked fond, regardless.\nEveryone filtered in quickly after that: Uraraka came in with her hair puffed out around her ears and grass lines on her cheek, and collapsed into a seat at the counter; Satou and Hagakure bounced inside, baskets of apples from the orchard in their arms; Todoroki emerged and kissed Midoriya on the temple, and set about helping them make toast; Asui ducked into the shower and then came out, freshly dressed, to request scrambled eggs; Aoyama tumbled inside in a frenzy, clutching his hair and rushing to the bathroom to fix it; Ojiro joined Midoriya at the coffee machine, helping to hand mugs to everyone.\nKaminari, Sero, and Ashido\u00a0woke when most people were already up. They ran into the kitchen in various states of dress, shouting about how late it was.\n\u201cWe have to work today,\u201d Ashido said between bouts of swearing. She had slept in her clothes. She tugged a sweater over her rumbled t-shirt rather than fetch a fresh shirt.\nOjiro handed them coffee, and watched, horrified, as Kaminari chugged his like a shot, stole Sero\u2019s mug, and drunk that, too.\n\u201cI want to die,\u201d Kaminari said.\n\u201cThis is poor behaviour,\u201d Iida said. \u201cIf you knew you had to be at work early today, then you should have\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTo be fair, we never really get together like this,\u201d Jirou said from where she was sitting on the kitchen counter, legs crossed, watching with fascination as Kaminari was attempting to brush his hair and almost ripped his fringe out.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame them for being enthusiastic,\u201d Midoriya agreed. He looked over the occupants of the room with butter soft eyes. \u201cWe should do this again. Seeing everyone in one place \u2026 it\u2019s like we\u2019re back in school again.\u201d\nTodoroki said, \u201cIt feels like a family reunion.\u201d\nThey paused for a moment to take that in. The countryside was a gentle rush of sound around them\u2014birds singing in the orchard; the eggs sizzling on the stove; Kirishima and Bakugou shouting over the bacon in the backyard.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to throw up,\u201d Kaminari finally said, and disappeared into the bathroom to do just that.\nOjiro handed out painkillers and helped them gather their things. Sero pushed his hair back with a borrowed bandana, and boxed up the left over apple pie when no one else tried to claim it. Kaminari emerged from the bathroom, more coherent but still miserable, and the three set off for the train station.\nToshinori woke as Iida was starting on a second batch of chocolate pancakes. He accepted a platter of apple slices from Midoriya and settled in at the dining table between Uraraka and Hagakure.\n\u201cSorry about the mess in the backyard,\u201d Ojiro said to Toshinori, handing over a mug of herbal tea. \u201cWe\u2019ll clean it up before we leave.\u201d\nToshinori offered them a brilliant smile. \u201cMy boy, my house has never looked better than with all of you in it.\u201d\nShinsou was the last person to stumble into the kitchen. He took the chocolate pancake Midoriya gave him, and didn\u2019t fight when Ojiro guarded the coffee machine. He choked down the pancake in three bites, and then took himself into the living room to sleep on the couch.\n\u201cWill he be okay?\u201d Toshinori asked with concern.\n\u201cHe\u2019s nocturnal,\u201d Todoroki said from where he was toasting bread.\nOjiro nodded. \u201cYeah, he usually works nightshift, so he\u2019s used to sleeping all day. He doesn\u2019t have to be at work until later tonight.\u201d\nAfter breakfast, they cleaned up the backyard. Kirishima and Bakugou had already started, and it didn\u2019t take long with their combined efforts. Then, half of them left for the train station, and the other half headed into the village proper.\nMidoriya gathered Toshinori up and gave him a piggyback into town. Midoriya remembered training in the ten months leading up to the UA entrance exam and carrying Toshinori on his back like this, struggling to take a single step under his impressive weight. Now, it was the easiest thing in the world. Toshinori\u2019s bony fingers laced under his chin, and Midoriya jogged along the grassy path, his friends chasing after them.\nA group of kids were in the middle of a soccer game when they arrived. The kids saw the small group of heroes, and quickly pulled them into their game.\nIida, Todoroki, Jirou, and Hagakure were on\u00a0one team, and Midoriya, Ojiro, and Tokoyami\u00a0were on the other. Midoriya\u2019s team tried to argue that three heroes against four wasn\u2019t fair, but the opposition\u00a0insisted\u00a0that going up against the Number One hero was a challenge in its own right.\nShinsou eventually met up with them. He joined Midoriya\u2019s team, but sabotaged them by brain-washing Midoriya and Ojiro and\u00a0forcing them to jump into the nearby stream.\nThe cold water shocked them out of the mild hypnosis, and they returned, soaked and laughing, to press their wet hands to a spluttering Shinsou\u2019s face.\n\u201cI\u2019m a rogue agent,\u201d Shinsou told the disgruntled kids when they accused him of cheated. In retaliation, they tackled him\u00a0and wrestled the ball away.\n\u201cThis is a no contact sport,\u201d Iida said.\n\u201cLet it happen,\u201d Jirou said. \u201cShinsou deserves it.\u201d\n\u201cHe helped our team, though,\u201d Hagakure said.\n\u201cNot for the rule-breaking. I mean, like, in general Shinsou deserves to be tackled by a pack of country kids.\u201d\nThe game devolved further. The grass and Tokoyami end up thickly coated in frost from Todoroki. Toshinori was the referee, but he spent the rest of the game laughing\u00a0instead of\u00a0enforcing the rules.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nstevoonie @stevoonie\nguess who spotted charge bolt, cellophane and pinky on the train this morning #bignight? #ithoughtchargeboltwasgonnahurl #hungoverheroes\n[Image: Kaminari, Sero, and Ashido sat side by side on train seats. The carriage was half-empty, but they were squashed together. Ashido was fast asleep, her mouth hanging open. Sero was playing candy crush on his phone, a paper box balanced on his lap.

Jirou\u2019s arm was around Yaoyorozu\u2019s waist. Toshinori stood in the middle of the group, beaming. Twenty former students. Two former teachers. All of them gathered to celebrate ten long, wonderful years.]\nuaclass1a\n100,631 likes\nHappy 10 year reunion! It was amazing to see everyone in the same place again.
