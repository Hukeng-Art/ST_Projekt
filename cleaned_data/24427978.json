    "text": "Will realizes Hannibal is the Chesapeake Ripper the first time he has an orgasm in his presence.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s slightly more involved than just being in his presence, but that\u2019s really neither here nor there. What\u2019s both here and there is that at the same time as his fingers are spasming hard on Will\u2019s hips and his head is falling back against the pillow with a gutted moan, he\u2019s imagining that Will is covered in someone else\u2019s blood, someone who they\u2019ve recently murdered together, and also that there\u2019s a ring on his finger.\n\u00a0\nIt must be one hell of an orgasm, because on top of being enough to make him drop his usually-impeccable mental shields, it rockets straight into Will\u2019s brain and shoves him over the edge, too. Which is a good thing, because coming all over Hannibal\u2019s chest gives him a pretty good excuse to lie boneless and unresponsive next to his bedmate for a few minutes while he processes an entire photo album\u2019s worth of meticulous murder scenes that go all the way back to something dark and untouchable in Lithuania, thinking what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWill\u2019s service weapon is somewhere downstairs, with his pants. So is his phone.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t like his chances in an unarmed hand-to-hand fight with a man who has fifty pounds on him and is also a serial killer. And he really doesn\u2019t like his chances in an unarmed hand-to-hand fight with someone he\u2019s still, even after that unholy barrage of images, fairly certain is the love of his life.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo instead of starting a fight, physical or otherwise, he rolls over and bites Hannibal\u2019s chin in a sloppy kiss. Hannibal rumbles underneath him, like a great primeval beast waking from a centuries-long sleep, and fists a hand in Will\u2019s curls. Will\u2019s come is sticky in Hannibal\u2019s chest hair, and Will makes an angry noise and demands, \u201cYour fingers,\u201d because he\u2019s not sure he\u2019s ever going to be able to let himself have this again.\n\u00a0\nHannibal pulls back to give him an amused look, and says in his odd, prim voice, \u201cYou cannot possibly be hard again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Will agrees, ragged, \u201cI just feel so fucking empty.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd I might never feel full again, he doesn\u2019t say, but Hannibal\u2019s expression shifts from amused to heartbreakingly affectionate, the kind of affection that Will thought was reserved for people who\u2019d been married sixty years. \u201cDear Will,\u201d he murmurs.\n\u00a0\nAnother man might say please, but Will is Will, so he says, \u201cFuck, come on\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnything,\u201d Hannibal acquiesces, as polite as if they were fully clothed and he were telling Will, of course you can have sugar in your tea. \u201cAnything you want.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe slides his fingers back into Will, into the hot mess of lube and his own come, and Will makes a short, shocked noise at the feel of it\u2014the sort of noise he imagines he\u2019d make if he\u2019d been stabbed. He gasps up at the ceiling, lungs heaving with overstimulation, his whole body alight with it. These hands have killed people. Innocent people. It should make him feel sick. Dirty. Ashamed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut Hannibal uses his other hand to hitch Will\u2019s leg up over his side, sinking to drag wet kisses over his feverish neck, and crooks his fingers over that spot that makes Will go absolutely buck fucking wild, and Will holds onto his hair, holds onto the sweaty skin of his bare shoulders, and feels Hannibal smile against his pulse point. Will brushes up against the steady calm of Hannibal\u2019s mental shields, back in place, and it feels like it always does\u2014like sinking in still, cool water, a pool so deep that it\u2019s really no use trying to find the bottom, that he could happily let go and sink in forever.\n\u00a0\nWhat are \u2018innocent people,\u2019 really. What are \u2018people,\u2019 really. Will\u2019s never had much use for them and they\u2019ve never had much use for him. So maybe\u2014probably\u2014in a choice between the rest of the world and Hannibal, he\u2019s going to choose Hannibal.\n\u00a0\nLater, when Hannibal\u2019s sleeping the heavy sleep of the hibernating bear, Will slips down the stairs completely naked, picks up his gun and his phone and goes looking for the basement that he glimpsed when Hannibal\u2019s shields were down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not hard to find, once he\u2019s looking for it. He\u2019s sort of hoping all he finds down there will be some dry splatters of blood, but instead there\u2019s half a dead body on an operating table and a pretentious collection of full-body clear plastic jumpsuits that Will would bet are bespoke.\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t sit down in the basement, because he\u2019s not too keen on his bare ass meeting whatever bodily residue is on the floor. But he does tromp back up the stairs (quietly, mind you, aware that being discovered is still not a good idea despite what may or may not have been said in the throes of carnal ecstasy), where he retrieves his underwear and then sits down on one of the ornate ten-thousand-dollar antique chaise lounges in Hannibal\u2019s sitting room. One part of his brain is having a loud, logical freak-out. He tells it to shut the fuck up so he can think.\n\u00a0\nObviously, this is going to require a lot of maneuvering.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWill sits there thinking for a good five minutes before he realizes it\u2019s probably a bad idea to try and figure this all out in a serial killer\u2019s house. So he gets dressed, fishes some paper out of the desk in Hannibal\u2019s study, and leaves a note on the kitchen counter: Went to feed dogs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nThe major issue with being a telepath who works for the FBI is that it fucking sucks. None of what Will gets out of witnesses or suspects is admissable as evidence, so mostly his role is to stand around making concrete statements that Jack Crawford takes as hand-wavy mysticism, useful for guidance but not to be actually trusted.\n\u00a0\nFBI agents, especially Will\u2019s students, tend to see his job as a profiler as secondary to his identity as a telepath, which means he has to weather a constant onslaught of snide remarks insinuating that every case he\u2019s ever closed has been a result of mind control forcing the suspects to confess.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWill\u2019s been enduring similar comments in every arena of his life since his mother felt that first flicker of telepathy at age two and got the hell out of fucking dodge, so mostly he lets it roll off his back like water\u2014at least until Jack\u2019s boss Kade Prurnell shows up and not so much insinuates as flat-out accuses him of having committed the murders himself and manufactured convenient suspects after the fact. When she\u2019s unswayed by the fact that Will has an alibi for every single fucking crime he\u2019s being accused of, he may or may not resort to some mild mind control. More suggestion, really, that she kindly go back to whatever bog she climbed out of. He\u2019s pretty sure Jack was wise to that one, but his head was on the chopping block too, so he let it slide.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe worst part isn\u2019t that everyone thinks Will is either incompetent or, on the wild far end of the spectrum, suspiciously competent; it\u2019s the fucking shielding technique they teach at Quantico, which is, frankly, rude. Bumping up against someone\u2019s thoughts in the halls is like missing the bottom step on a flight of stairs, or sticking his foot out over a cliff he didn\u2019t know was there, or his body shocking him awake when he\u2019s falling asleep and it decides he\u2019s actually falling. All day, every day that he has a lecture or is consulting on a case, Will feels like he\u2019s just gone over the top of a rollercoaster, his stomach in his throat.\n\u00a0\nSo the first time Jack introduced him to Hannibal, and he felt those cool water shields, he asked immediately, \u201cPsychiatrist or serial killer?\u201d The only people he\u2019d ever met with shields that strong were mental health professionals and people with particularly bloody secrets to hide.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPsychiatrist,\u201d Hannibal answered easily, and for some reason instead of sounding offended, he sounded pleased as punch.\n\u00a0\nSix months later, in hindsight, the whole thing would be fucking hilarious.\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nThe long and winding road that eventually ends up with Will in bed with his cannibal psychiatrist takes an abrupt left turn when Will is diagnosed with encephalitis.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEncephalitis, as it turns out, is a particularly potent and disruptive disease for a telepath to have, and tends to manifest not so much as a personal issue than as an issue that affects everyone in a ten mile radius. Will\u2019s doctor, when Will finally wakes up out of a very, very deep and disorienting sleep to find himself in the hospital, informs him that the entire population of Wolf Trap, Virginia has been complaining of strange dreams for weeks, and that three days ago, when he decided to drive into work with a 105 degree fever, he collapsed in the lobby and knocked out three security guards, ten agents on their way to work, and one unlucky bird.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEveryone but the bird will be fine,\u201d the doctor assures him, droll and uninterested. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to come in twice a week for outpatient plasmapheresis. You\u2019re not allowed anywhere near the driver\u2019s seat of a car, and you\u2019re gonna feel like someone scraped off a layer of your brain, but that should pass in a few months.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s an apt description. Will does, indeed, feel like someone scraped off a layer of his brain.\n\u00a0\nHe gets Alana Bloom to drive him to the hospital for the first plasmapheresis treatment, because she\u2019s kind and nurturing and, as a psychiatrist, her shields are stronger than most, so she can deal with Will\u2019s recovering brain flapping around inside the car like a trapped bat.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut her wards, unlike Hannibal\u2019s, are grating after a while. At first they\u2019re like staring into direct sunlight\u2014you can just look away and move on with your life. But then, the more you accidentally glance in that direction, the more the sunlight seems to grow, getting brighter and more intrusive until he\u2019s climbing out the car door before she can even come to a stop in the hospital parking lot, snapping at her that he\u2019s fine, Alana, really I\u2019m fine,\u00a0 I\u2019m going to find another ride home, thanks, and slamming the door over her concerned objections.\n\u00a0\nWhile he\u2019s sitting there shivering in his sweater, watching his blood flow out of his body, he tries to hoodwink the doctor into giving him back his license. The doctor\u2014the same one he had in the ER\u2014falls for absolutely none of his \u2018very important FBI business\u2019 bullshit and suggests he calls someone with a \u2018calming mental presence\u2019 to drive him home.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, someone who\u2019s been lobotomized,\u201d Will bites. He\u2019s feeling even less charitable than usual.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPreferably not,\u201d the doctor\u2019s not even looking at him, checking something on his charts. \u201cMaybe a really smart dog. As long as he\u2019s licensed.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWill calls Hannibal instead.\n\u00a0\nHannibal rolls up in his Bentley, opens the door for Will, and ushers him into a passenger seat that\u2019s been converted into a nest of blankets. The chill in Will\u2019s veins is so unsettling that he doesn\u2019t even grumble that much, just pulls the blankets close around him and settles in, forgetting his seatbelt so that Hannibal, when he climbs back into the passenger seat, has to take the time to give Will a gently chiding look, reach across, and buckle it himself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you hold up a Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond?\u201d Will asks, once they\u2019re pulling out of the parking lot.\n\u00a0\nHannibal smiles, but only with his eyes. \u201cI am aware that there are a number of unpleasant side effects of plasmapheresis. Though I am unable to do anything about the fatigue or the nausea, I can at least provide a solution for the cold.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWill, who feels very warm and very calm every time he accidentally brushes up against Hannibal\u2019s shields, manages a quiet, \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHannibal gives him a surprised, pleased look. \u201cThere is no need to thank me, Will. I find that I am willing to go to much greater lengths on your behalf than merely acquiring a few blankets.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re nice blankets,\u201d Will shoots back, unsure why he\u2019s arguing, but actually very sure\u2014he always argues with people he likes, because it\u2019s easier to bare his teeth and scare them away pre-emptively than it is to wait around for them to leave.\n\u00a0\nBut Hannibal only eye-smiles some more. \u201cThey are yours, if you want them.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWill is grudgingly, stupidly charmed. Probably, from a psychological point of view, it has a lot to do with how Will\u2019s dad mostly provided for him by teaching him how to find jobs where there was never any paperwork so no one cared how old he was, and how Hannibal has been cooking for Will and offering him emotional support since basically the second they met.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHannibal shifts his schedule to accomodate Will\u2019s treatment without so much as a word of complaint. But it\u2019s not after the first ride that they fall into bed, or the second, or even the third. It\u2019s not until after Will goes back to work.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis doctor has advised him that it would be wise to continue avoiding stress of all sorts (mental, professional, sexual) for at least another month, but that if he accidentally encounters some it probably won\u2019t kill him, which Jack interprets as both a ringing endorsement of Will\u2019s wellness and as permission to bring him in on a case immediately. Objectively, it\u2019s not a good idea, but it\u2019s pretty much par for the course as far as Will is concerned, so really he expects it all would\u2019ve gone fine if not for the suspect with mental shields like a business of rabid ferrets.\n\u00a0\nAdded to the scraped-off layer of his brain, the sensation of hundreds of tiny claws digging into his psyche is enough to drive Will temporarily mad. He doesn\u2019t really remember shutting himself in the bathroom at the dinky local police station in Pennsylvania, but he does vaguely remember Beverly Katz knocking on the other side of the door, struggling to keep her shields together, and saying, \u201cWill? Can we call someone for you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWill mostly just wants his dogs, the comforting emptiness of their canine minds, but he doesn\u2019t think the FBI is going to send someone to go retrieve seven dogs from a state three hours away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut he needs something. He feels like he\u2019s coming apart at the seams, and holding his head in his hands, no matter how tight his fingers are digging in, isn\u2019t really doing it for him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHannibal,\u201d he thinks he says. He gets told later that he doesn\u2019t really say it at all, but that the entire police station\u2014most of which is waiting outside in the rainy parking lot\u2014hears his voice clattering around inside their skulls like someone standing on a roof banging pots and pans and screaming at the top of his lungs: HANNIBAL, HANNIBAL, HANNIBAL.\n\u00a0\nHannibal\u2019s still two hours away, even if he comes, so Will sticks his head under the faucet and tries to calm himself down with a breathing technique that a well-meaning school counselor had read on a yoga website and tried to teach him in the third grade, but it\u2019s never really worked before and it doesn\u2019t work now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe can feel little fits and spurts of people\u2019s thoughts all around him, like flies fat and stupid with blood bumping against an open wound. Luckily, the perp has been taken off the property and into FBI custody (on account of Will yelling at Jack, Him, it\u2019s him! on his way to go puke), so Will doesn\u2019t have to deal with anymore rabid ferrets, but he still gets fleeting, nauseating glimpses of people in the parking lot thinking about Italian hoagies and their kid\u2019s peewee soccer game and how tight their wife\u2019s sister\u2019s ass looked in those yoga pants at the family barbecue last week.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a near-constant stream of triviality, of absolutely fucking inane drivel, and Will gets so fed up about the smallness of it all that it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, later that night, when he stands over half a dead body in Hannibal\u2019s basement and thinks that nothing else in the world matters except the man he left sleeping upstairs. Who maybe isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s idea of moral but understands better than anyone Will\u2019s ever met that the thin veneer which covers the reality of the world\u2014that all people are is animals pretending to be civilized\u2014is really just that: a veneer.\n\u00a0\nEither Will stands there with his head under the faucet for two hours, or he\u2019s losing time again, because the next thing Will is aware of is Hannibal knocking very politely on the other side of the door and saying, \u201cWilliam? May I come in?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Will says, choking a little as he gets water in his mouth.\n\u00a0\nHannibal\u2019s voice comes back, muffled, \u201cWould you mind unlocking the door?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Will says again, \u201cI would,\u201d because he\u2019s not sure he\u2019d make it over to the door if he tried walking right now. He\u2019s feeling a little\u2026spinny.\n\u00a0\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Hannibal answers. A moment later, he busts down the door with his shoulder. Will manages to sort of lurch out of the way, still holding onto the sink for dear life, and Hannibal closes the ruined door delicately behind him, dusts drywall off his three-piece windowpane suit, and turns to Will with an ill-concealed look of self-satisfaction.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWill, who still doesn\u2019t know at this point that Hannibal is the serial killer he\u2019s been hunting for the better part of his entire career, reaches out without lifting his head and puts his wet hand on the front of Hannibal\u2019s vest. Hannibal gives the appendage a mildly alarmed look, before taking Will\u2019s wrist oh-so-gently between his fingers, and stepping closer.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you mean it?\u201d Will asks. \u201cIn the car, about\u2014greater lengths.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Hannibal says, in the sort of hushed reverent tone that one uses in a church. \u201cAny service that you should require. You need only ask.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe truth of the statement holds when Will straightens unsteadily from the sink, using Hannibal like one of those IV poles they give him to walk to the plasmapheresis recovery room; Hannibal only slides an arm around his waist to steady him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI need you to center me,\u201d Will says, trying to give Hannibal a quite serious look in the eyes that he\u2019s pretty sure comes across twitchy and deranged, with the wet hair and the dripping face and all. \u201cThat guy destroyed my control, I\u2019m all over the place\u2014\u201c\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have never had to center a telepath before,\u201d Hannibal informs him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust focus on your shields,\u201d Will tells him, dredging up years-old emergency instructions from his field orientation in the NOPD, \u201cand grab onto me really hard. Like, bruise me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHannibal looks vaguely distressed at the idea of hurting him, which is touching, really, except that Will\u2019s kind of dying here and he needs Hannibal to manhandle him. So he grabs Hannibal first, fingers tight around his bicep, and lets some of his jittery desperation bleed over into Hannibal, as a kick in the pants.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Hannibal breathes, \u201coh, my dear,\u201d and takes hold of him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHannibal\u2019s shields wash over him like dipping under the surface of a pool in the middle of a hot summer day, and the relief is so overwhelming that Will slumps forward against his psychiatrist\u2019s chest and makes a noise that\u2019s probably illegal in Alabama.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s only then, after Hannibal has escorted Will out to his car, surreptitiously (but not really that surreptitiously, because everyone is watching them until Will glowers at Beverly and she takes the hint to tell everyone else to mind their own fucking business) holding Will tight with an arm underneath his workman\u2019s jacket, after he\u2019s driven him all the way back to Baltimore, insisting that it\u2019s better for Will not to be alone right now, after Will\u2019s gone into the bathroom to swallow an entire bottle of excedrin and run his head under the tap again, after he comes out and hears the tail end of what appears to be Hannibal telling Jack off over the phone\u2014it\u2019s only then that Will gives Hannibal a long look across the foyer, feeling like he\u2019s been reduced entirely to a thing that wants Hannibal\u2019s hands on him, and says, \u201cI\u2019d really like you to fuck me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHannibal gives a small, surprised tilt of the head. \u201cIs this part of your centering?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Will admits. \u201cIt can be if you want.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you want it to be, Will?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWill\u2019s too wrung out to be sure what the right answer is\u2014the answer that will get him in Hannibal\u2019s bed. Normally he might be able to figure it out. Now all he has is honesty.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want it to be\u2026a proclamation,\u201d he says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s the most dramatic thing that\u2019s ever come out of his mouth, and in any other circumstance he might be mortified. But it\u2019s Hannibal he\u2019s talking to, who puts on dinner parties that are really more like five act plays and patronizes the opera and broke down the bathroom door when he could have just gone out to the parking lot and asked any officer for keys.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo instead of getting a laugh to cover up discomfort, which is what Will is pretty sure he would\u2019ve gotten from anyone else, he gets dark eyes, a sudden, predatory stillness, and the words, \u201cThen a proclamation it shall be, my dear Will.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWill moans before Hannibal even makes it across the foyer to kiss him. Sue him; his brain has lost a layer to scraping and a significant chunk of meat to some very angry ferrets.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHannibal certainly seems to like it, if his answering growl is any indicator. And then he\u2019s holding Will\u2019s jaw carefully in his hand and fucking devouring his mouth, clothes are flying and Will\u2019s gun hits the floor with a thump and Hannibal picks him up\u2014somehow still in his pants and shirtsleeves even though Will\u2019s buck fucking naked\u2014and carries him up the stairs.\n\u00a0\nTwo hours later, Will shuts the front door quietly behind him, and says, \u201cFuck.\u201d\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nNo one would ever dare describe Hannibal as \u2018sloppy,\u2019 but basically everyone who\u2019s ever met him would describe him as \u2018arrogant,\u2019 and therein lies the problem.\n\u00a0\nIf Will remembers high school English correctly (which he might not, given how many nights he spent working at the shipyard and how exhausted he was all the time and how he mostly just copied answers straight out of the brain of the straight-A student with flower berets in the front row), then hubris is a fatal flaw that crops up quite a lot in tragedy. And while Will figures he doesn\u2019t have anything like fate or prophecy to contend with, undermining the effects of Hannibal\u2019s pride is going to be a tall order in and of itself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe starts subtly altering his Ripper profile. He claims it\u2019s got to do with the new bodies they\u2019re finding, and it\u2019s bullshit but neither Jack nor anyone else in the BAU knows enough to dispute him. Beverly and the forensics squad suffer a catastrophic loss of data when someone forgets to put the server room thermostat on the correct temperature during a heatwave, and Will spends a long two days shut up in a conference room with them and Jack pretending to try to reconstruct all the files from memory.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWill\u2019s capacity for playacting is very limited to begin with, and the more he covers for Hannibal the cockier Hannibal seems to get, so the more playacting Will has to do.\n\u00a0\nAll telepaths are used to faking it to a certain degree, of course. Smile at the pretty blonde cashier while trying to ignore the fact that she\u2019s thinking about plowing her girlfriend with a strap-on and her shields are shit. Hurry through the empty parking lot to the car, and don\u2019t start a fight with the drunk who said well hel-lo when you passed the alley where he was taking a piss, because it\u2019s not actually a crime for him to picture shoving you up against the wall and making you suck his cock, so the only thing throwing a punch will do is land you in jail.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut that\u2019s temporary stuff. By the time he made it to high school, Will barely even registered it anymore. Nowadays, it feels like he\u2019s lying to everyone about everything. It\u2019s exhausting. He gets home every night and just about collapses inside the door, forcing every muscle in his body to relax one by one while the simple happiness of his dogs quiets his scattered mind. By the third time he has to stop one of his students in the hall to ask them what day it is, he figures that the amount of whiskey he\u2019s drinking and the amount of excedrin he\u2019s taking with it is probably not a long-term solution.\n\u00a0\nYeah, he caves. But he tells himself that he\u2019s only going to let himself go to Hannibal once.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s been artfully and then not-so-artfully avoiding Hannibal\u2019s dinner invitations, but it\u2019s been a few weeks since they slept together and Will knows he\u2019s starting to get suspicious. A proclamation, he\u2019d said, and that had clearly meant something to Hannibal, and now the most contact they\u2019ve had in almost a month is one late-night phone call full of long, dangerous pauses and a few brief meetings in the halls of Quantico where Hannibal did his best to communicate as much carnal intent through the touch of his hand at Will\u2019s fully-clothed elbow as he possibly could, all while Will attempted not to catch on fire while Alana watched, patient and completely unawares, from the sidelines.\n\u00a0\nBut Will hasn\u2019t had a good meal or a good night\u2019s sleep in what feels like for-fucking ever, so he calls Hannibal and, the second he picks up, says, \u201cAre you free for dinner?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a brief pause. Probably Hannibal reconciling the (correct) impression that Will\u2019s been avoiding him with this sudden intensity. Then Hannibal remarks, \u201cThis is quite fortuitous timing. I\u2019ve been meaning to test out a new dish that I suspect you will enjoy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood,\u201d Will says, \u201cgreat, I\u2019ll be there at seven.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not until he\u2019s sitting at the table with a fork halfway to his mouth that he remembers he might be eating some perfectly nice man by the name of Joe with two-point-five kids, a wife, and a secret stash of Oktoberfest-themed pornography under his bed. Antelope, Hannibal had told him, over drinks in the kitchen, seared in a green chili sauce. Will figures it\u2019s probably too elaborate a thing to lie about, fucking antelope, and anyways if he\u2019s going to be spending the rest of his life with this man he should probably get used to believing his lies (at least in the culinary department) or get used to the idea that he might be eating Joe.\n\u00a0\nAfter dinner, Will lingers in the door to the kitchen watching Hannibal do the dishes, and finds to his distant but not unsubstantial distress that it\u2019s not hard at all to focus on the wet, sudsy skin of Hannibal\u2019s forearms where he\u2019s rolled his sleeves up over his elbows, and forget entirely that eight feet below them is a murder basement.\n\u00a0\nHe tunes out for a few minutes, looking over the strong lines of Hannibal\u2019s shoulders and thinking about what it had felt like, as a grown man, to be carried up the stairs. When he tunes back in, Hannibal\u2019s saying something about second thoughts in a tone of voice that\u2019s so uninterested and mild that Will knows immediately he\u2019s faking.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo second thoughts,\u201d he interrupts, firmly. \u201cNot about this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo one would blame you, Will,\u201d Hannibal insists, still with his back turned, \u201cleast of all me. Ours is an unorthodox relationship. Some might even say unethical.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBecause you\u2019re my therapist, or because you kill people? Will wants to ask.\n\u00a0\nInstead, he says, \u201cHannibal\u2026everyone does this eventually, don\u2019t they? Everyone comes to a point in their life when they find the one thing they\u2019d be willing to sacrifice everything else for.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHannibal stills in the process of drying his hands, and Will is struck with the sudden thought that maybe he\u2019s not that to Hannibal. He\u2019d only seen inside his mind for a split second. He doesn\u2019t really know. Maybe Hannibal would rather keep on killing, alone and in secret, outsmarting the FBI and congratulating himself on his own cleverness by serving extravagant spreads made out of the one dinner guest who everyone\u2019s wondering after.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMaybe Will is always going to be secondary to Hannibal\u2019s freedom.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean,\u201d he backtracks, with an awkward cough. \u201cIf I\u2019m not that for you, then\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t have to finish that sentence, because Hannibal throws aside the dish towel with a lack of care that\u2019s actually alarming, crosses the room in two strides, and kisses him. Will tries to grab onto his head, realizes he\u2019s still holding a glass of scotch, and detangles himself from Hannibal so he can deposit it on the counter.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHannibal has him right back in his arms the second he turns around. He presses another short kiss to his lips, and Will tastes salt, and when they break apart he realizes Hannibal is crying, just a little. \u201cDear Will,\u201d he murmurs, between their mouths. \u201cOf course you are that for me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWill seizes him again, furious at himself and furious at Hannibal and furious that he knows about the Ripper and he can\u2019t just come over for dinner, blissfully unaware, and let their verbal jousting in Hannibal\u2019s dining room turn to a different sort of jousting in the bedroom.\n\u00a0\nHe refuses to be carried, because he\u2019s feeling bristly tonight, but the second he\u2019s naked and laying back on Hannibal\u2019s silk sheets he finds he suddenly has access to a deep well of patience.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want very much to take you apart,\u201d Hannibal tells him, kneeling between Will\u2019s bent knees. His voice sounds almost the same as ever, except not quite, like a spool of thread that\u2019s been unrolled and then rolled back up too fast. \u201cWill you let me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWill stares at Hannibal\u2019s big hands on the insides of his legs, pressing him gently apart, darker than Will\u2019s own skin and sort of blurry without his glasses on. For a split second, he swears to god he sees a wedding band on Hannibal\u2019s left ring finger.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ll let you,\u201d he says, echoing Hannibal\u2019s words in the kitchen. \u201cHannibal.\u201d\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nWill\u2019s been covering for Hannibal for six damn months. Miriam Lass is the final fucking straw.\n\u00a0\nHis hands are shaking\u2014with anger or fear, he can\u2019t really tell\u2014as he lets himself in the front door of Hannibal\u2019s house. He has a key. He has a lot of things, now. A drawer in Hannibal\u2019s walk-in closet. A toothbrush in the master bathroom. A bad habit of falling asleep with his mind lingering halfway down the street, at the intersection the FBI would have to come through if they wanted to storm the house in the middle of the night.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe bullshit he fed Jack back at Quantico is only going to last for as long as it takes them to get another telepath in, a specialist. The brainwashing Hannibal did on Miriam is good if you\u2019re just a normal person without the ability to peek in other people\u2019s brains, but it stood out like a huge fucking beacon yelling, \u2019tampered with! I\u2019ve been tampered with!\u2019 the second Will got her to drop her shields. He\u2019s not sure what Hannibal was thinking, or if he was thinking at all\u2014maybe Will\u2019s protection has gotten so good that he thinks he\u2019s infallible.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s had two fake passports in his glovebox since a case a few months ago that would\u2019ve involved a forger, if Will hadn\u2019t destroyed some evidence. They\u2019re for a Mr. and Mr. Haarlem, so he also has a couple of gold wedding bands that he got from a pawn broker (better that they look worn, not brand new). He takes the whole spread and positions himself in the sitting room to wait for Hannibal to get home from work. He figures the sitting room is his best bet if the big reveal goes south; all the knives are in the kitchen and in here it\u2019ll take Hannibal a couple seconds to dive for one of those heavy ostentatious statues sitting around on pedestals, which will be long enough for Will to pull his gun and shoot him in the leg.\n\u00a0\nNot that he really wants to shoot the love of his life in the leg, or anywhere on his person, but, you know, needs must, and anyway he\u2019s got a lot of unexpressed rage.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA few minutes after he settles in, the door opens and closes, and Hannibal calls, \u201cWill?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIn the sitting room,\u201d Will calls back.\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a moment of shuffling as Hannibal divests himself of his overcoat, his briefcase, and his keys, and then he\u2019s coming through the doorway with a pleasant smile, dropping a kiss on Will\u2019s head on his way to drop a file on his desk. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d he asks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d Will says, tetchy, \u201cexcept that the next person to take a look in Miriam Lass\u2019s head is going to break that conditioning in three seconds.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHannibal stills. There\u2019s a letter opener on the desk, very close to his hand. Will puts a hand on his sidearm, because it seems prudent, but doesn\u2019t take it out of the holster.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you going to shoot me, Will?\u201d Hannibal asks, carefully.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d Will replies, too tired by a mile and knowing that there\u2019s a long way to go before he can rest. \u201cI\u2019d rather we skip this part and use the fake passports I got us to flee the country before Jack wises up to the fact that I\u2019ve been covering for the Chesapeake Ripper for half a year, but if you grab that letter opener, I\u2019ll shoot you anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHannibal takes his hand away from the letter opener. \u201cI have a summer home in France that should do nicely.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWill picks up the wedding rings, shoves one on his finger, marches across the room, and shoves the other on Hannibal\u2019s. \u201cYou can book the flights. I have to go say goodbye to my dogs.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSome of the stress of the last six months must bleed through into his words\u2014or maybe it\u2019s the idea of leaving behind his pack that finally does it, finally makes his voice crack and his eyes tear up behind his glasses\u2014because Hannibal\u2019s expression goes abruptly tender. \u201cOh, my dear,\u201d he cups Will\u2019s face in his hands and kisses him, and Will feels the hot overspill of tears, clinging heavy to his eyelashes, probably getting all over his lenses.\n\u00a0\nWill shoves Hannibal off. \u201cI\u2019m mad at you,\u201d he snaps, but the statement probably loses some of its impact when he sniffles hard and wipes at his face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI will meet you at the airport,\u201d Hannibal says. It sounds like I\u2019m sorry.\n\u00a0\nWill brings his dogs to a kennel and pays them all the money in his bank account to keep them for as long as it takes to adopt them out to good homes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt feels like he\u2019s tearing out a piece of himself, listening to the echo of their barks in the back room, feeling the confused buzz of their fear and unhappiness, and he thinks\u2014this is what he was actually talking about, when he stood in the kitchen and told Hannibal he\u2019d choose him over everything else. With his job, with Hannibal\u2019s victims, it wasn\u2019t even hard. This is where he proves he meant it. This is where love gets its pound of flesh: sitting in his car in the kennel parking lot, the whole station wagon still smelling of dog, hair all over the interior, giving himself five minutes to cry so hard his chest aches.\n\u00a0\nWhen he\u2019s all cried out, totally dry, he starts the car and drives to Dulles.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey have until at least tomorrow morning before Jack will be able to get another telepath in to look at Miriam, and that\u2019s only if he finds time somewhere in the frantic pandemonium of trying to build a case against Frederick Chilton. There\u2019s plenty of time to fly commercial; by the time Jack figures out exactly how much wool has been pulled over his eyes, Hannibal and Will should be safely through customs at Charles de Gaulle and completely untraceable unless Jack somehow secures the cooperation of the notoriously uncooperative French police.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWill remembers he still has his cell while he\u2019s driving over the Potomac, and slows down to chuck it out the window into the river, so finding Hannibal in the departures hall is mostly an exercise in trial and error.\n\u00a0\nHe finds him, at last, standing with two boarding passes near the end of the security line. His eyes light up when he sees Will coming towards him, even though Will must look like hell warmed over with his hair wet and windswept from the storm outside, his eyes red from crying, clothes that he thinks might actually be dirty crumpled and shoved hastily in a duffel, and Will realizes Hannibal must not have really known for certain whether Will would come.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019re only about twelve hours or so ahead of the biggest manhunt in FBI history, but Hannibal was scared he wouldn\u2019t come, so Will takes the time, right there in the departures terminal, to grab him by the lapels (honestly, who flies in a three piece suit?) and kiss him for all he\u2019s worth.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe FBI\u2019s really going to get an eyeful when they review the security footage, but Will figures that can just be his parting gift to Beverly: a bit of drama.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGreater lengths,\u201d Will tells Hannibal, when he draws away.\n\u00a0\nHannibal winds his fingers through Will\u2019s, smiling with his eyes. Their fake wedding bands clink together. \u201cWhy \u2018Haarlem\u2019?\u201d Hannibal asks, of all fucking things.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to empathize with the little dutch boy,\u201d Will deadpans.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSticking his finger in the dam,\u201d Hannibal murmurs. \u201cYou have a poetic side, after all.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWill doesn\u2019t dignify that with a response, just rolls his eyes heavenward and leads the way into the security line. An hour later, Mr. and Mr. Haarlem take their seats in first class (because of course Hannibal would shell out for first class when they\u2019re fleeing the law), their plane rumbles off into the deep night of the Atlantic, and Will feels a weight lift off his shoulders that\u2019s bigger than just a case, bigger than just a cover-up. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s leaving behind the veneer, he realizes. He\u2019s not pretending anymore.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWill?\u201d Hannibal asks softly, beside him.\n\u00a0\nWill blinks over at him. He must have zoned out, because Hannibal\u2019s watching him like he asked a question and is waiting for an answer. \u201cSorry, what?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHannibal reaches for his hand. \u201cI asked, when did you figure it out?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh.\u201d Will brushes up against the cool calm of Hannibal\u2019s shields. It feels like the calm of the cabin pressure around them, white noise and cotton balls. \u201cThe first time we slept together.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHannibal fails to hide a flicker of surprise. \u201cYou have known for that long?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Will says, and then, because he\u2019s so exhausted he could sleep for a week and Hannibal looks like he has a lot more questions, \u201cI promise I\u2019ll tell you everything, but right now I\u2019m about to pass out and I\u2019d really like to do it on your shoulder.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen my shoulder is yours,\u201d Hannibal says, with a faint, fond trace of amusement. And Will knows what he\u2019s really saying is my whole body is yours. My whole self is yours. Will doesn\u2019t need to see past Hannibal\u2019s shields to know that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWill puts all his weight against Hannibal\u2019s side, his head pillowed on his shoulder, and feels for a split second as Hannibal deliberately drops his shields, spilling forth a torrent of praise and affection and protectiveness and what he\u2019d like to do to Will once they make it to his seaside villa, one strong surge of devotion that makes Will feel so safe and understood and cared for that he\u2019s pulled immediately, unceremoniously, down to sleep. Grab onto me really hard, he dreams of himself asking, in a tiny bathroom, Hannibal with drywall on his suit jacket and a barely-concealed animal hunger in his eyes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHannibal in the dream says, You need only ask, dear Will, and does."
