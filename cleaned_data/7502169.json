    "text": "It hadn\u2019t been anyone\u2019s fault, not really. None of them quite knew how it had happened, or exactly  what  had happened in the first place, but what\u2019s done is done and it didn\u2019t seem like there was anything they could do to change it. At least, they didn\u2019t think they could.\nLance was a baby.\nNot as in acting like one or being immature \u2013 Keith thought that that was always the case with the Blue Paladin \u2013 but as in he had somehow been de-aged quite a number of years, like time had been rewound. They\u2019d been fighting on the furthest outskirts of Galra territory against a monster that they\u2019d never seen before when Lance and Blue had been caught up in a self-destructive blast. They hadn\u2019t known the monster was purposefully luring them in to catch them in the blast, but Lance had somehow realised it last minute, and drive Blue into the monster, sending them both careening far away from the other Paladins.\nHe\u2019d saved them, yeah, but at what cost? It was stupidly infuriating to feel so damn  worried  when Keith just didn\u2019t want to care. It was a nagging thought in the back of his head that only appeared when Lance got himself into serious danger, and it was infuriatingly distracting. \nThe first sign of trouble had been when the Blue Lion hadn\u2019t gotten up after the blast. While their Lions weren\u2019t exactly indestructible, Keith knew for sure that a blast with the radius he\u2019d witnessed wouldn\u2019t have done crazy damage. Lance should have been more than capable of shaking it off and returning back to them, like he always did. They could still reach him through the communications system and the Lion hadn\u2019t turned itself off, but Lance wasn\u2019t answering, not even when Shiro ordered him to report back to them.\nAnd then they\u2019d heard it \u2013 a child\u2019s cry.\nShiro had been the one to investigate, his metal hand held poised and glowing. They\u2019d dropped their Lions beside Blue once everyone had returned to the Castle and waited on the ground in the hangar for Shiro to re-emerge. His small sound of surprise was noticeable through their helmets and Keith couldn\u2019t help but tense, instinctively reaching for his bayard. \nBut nothing dangerous had come out after Shiro. Instead, Shiro had walked out of the Lion's mouth with a tiny child cradled in his arms, wrapped up in the shirt Lance wore under his suit.\nKeith didn\u2019t think anything weirder could have ever happened. \n\u201cHow did this occur?\u201d Allura demanded as she paced behind the couches in the common room. Keith wasn't sure if it was a question she really wanted them to answer. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Shiro answered. They didn\u2019t have any clothes that would fit Lance as he was, so he was wearing of Pidge\u2019s smaller shirts. Shiro had him held in his lap on his crossed legs, and for now Lance was quiet, content to let Shiro wrap the shirt around him securely. \u201cBut it was probably because of that blast at the end. It was designed to incapacitate us like\u2026 well,\u201d he held up Lance a little higher, \u201clike this.\u201d\nAllura leaned closer to peer at Lance. \u201cI\u2019ve never been this close to a human child before,\u201d she said. Her eyes were alight with rapid curiosity. \u201cMay I hold him?\u201d\nShiro hesitated for a moment, then frowned to himself, and carefully handed Lance over.\nLance\u2019s big eyes drifted up to Allura\u2019s face. He glowered at her furiously, like he was confused by her open expression or by the way she looked, and it made Keith tense again. Then, without any warning, Lance began to wail. His cries were high and sharp and they echoed around the room and cut straight at Keith\u2019s heart like nothing else ever had. \n\u201cOh no, what have I done?\u201d Allura worried, her eyes widening. She rocked Lance in her arms like a mother would but he only cried louder, his cheeks going splotchy and red. \u201cShiro-\u201d\nAt Allura\u2019s insistence, Shiro took Lance back. Lance seemed to fit in Shiro\u2019s arms better, and he didn\u2019t shy away from the metal one. Somehow, he looked more natural there. Maybe it was Shiro that looked comfortable with a child. When Shiro rocked Lance he quietened until he was only whining softly. \n\u201cYou\u2019re good with children, Shiro,\u201d Coran pointed out. \n\u201cAm I?\u201d Shiro asked, flustered. \u201cI haven\u2019t had much experience with them before...\" \n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how I upset him,\u201d Allura said. She held her hands to her chest as though they had been burned, her face full of guilt. \nShiro frowned a little. He didn't really seem like he'd stopped frowning since they found baby Lance. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything you did. We\u2019ve connected by Voltron, so maybe he recognises us Paladins a little better. Either way, we have to figure out how to fix him,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can form Voltron like this. Lance is far too defenceless.\u201d\n\u201cThe Castle should be equipped with an incubator that can run diagnostic scans on him,\u201d Allura said. \u201cIt\u2019s down in the infirmary. We used it to help ill children.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll take him there,\u201d Shiro said, standing. \u201cThe next time we come across a peaceful planet we\u2019ll have to pick up children\u2019s clothing, too. I doubt he can go around wearing Pidge\u2019s clothes until he returns to normal.\u201d\nIt sounded rational coming from Shiro when he said it like that, but some part of Keith said it definitely wasn\u2019t. Lance was a  baby  and they had to get him  baby clothes.  What could possibly be rational about that? Nothing, that\u2019s what. At least he wouldn\u2019t have to listen to that idiot\u2019s rambling for a while.\nStill, he followed the rest of the team down into the infirmary, reluctant to miss anything important. He didn\u2019t have any siblings and he\u2019d never really been around children; they were more alien to him than actual aliens. Still, his eyes were drawn to Lance\u2019s chubby little face the same way his eyes were drawn to something particularly disgusting \u2013 he just couldn\u2019t look away. \nLike Allura had said, the infirmary did have a small incubator. It looked like it was made for newborns, which made Shiro hesitate again. \u201cHe\u2019s probably been de-aged back to between eight and sixteen months old, I can't quite be sure. Is he going to fit in there?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll make it bigger,\u201d Allura answered. When the incubator had been expanded, Allura turned it on, and it powered up with a soft whir. Shiro gently lowered Lance in, who only continued to scowl and flail, looking like a fish out of water. How did babies survive into adulthood? They looked so vulnerable. Keith didn\u2019t understand it.\nA soft, blue light engulfed the ends of the incubator as a ray of light passed over it. Pidge crept closer, intrigued by the machine, and they all stood silently as it ran scans on Lance. Transparent screens detailing the results began to fill the air as the scans were each completed. Some flickered in and out faster than others, which made Allura raise her brows. \n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Shiro asked. \n\u201cHis vitals are all normal,\u201d Allura answered, surprised, \u201cbut it seems that this form is only temporary.\u201d\n\u201cHow long?\u201d\n\u201cA week, perhaps?\u201d She frowned once, and flicked a few of the screens away with a wave of her hand. \u201cHis cells are rapidly expanding and compressing, which indicates growth, but as you can see he isn\u2019t getting any bigger. I\u2019m sure he will revert to his normal age once the effects of the blast have worked their way through him.\u201d\n\u201cIs there any way to help him?\u201d Hunk asked. He had a concerned pinch in his brows. \u201cI mean, babies need a lot of care, right?\u201d\nAllura made a contemplative noise. \u201cI think we can only wait it out and hope that no Galra fleets come hailing us,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I think it would also be beneficial not to let Lance stress himself out. Crying, for example, should probably be avoided if at all possible.\u201d\nShiro nodded. \u201cAlright. Can I take him again?\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\nShiro picked Lance back up as the incubator turned off. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to find somewhere for him to sleep and see if he can stomach your food. This is certainly going to be an interesting week...\u201d\nThe Castle of Lions was equipped with a nursery for children located close to the infirmary, but it hadn\u2019t been attended to since Allura and Coran had awoken. Since Lance started to cry when Shiro tried to pass him over to Allura, it was up to the Paladins to clean up the room. They didn\u2019t know how the Altean people originally organised the nursery, but they made do. Shiro watched over them as they righted what looked like knocked over cribs and cleared away dust and debris.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why we have to do this,\u201d Keith muttered to himself. \n\u201cLance needs it,\u201d Shiro reminded him, voice gentle but insistent. \u201cEven if he is technically our age, in this form, he\u2019s much more vulnerable.\u201d\nIt was the same thought that Keith had had earlier that day. He didn\u2019t know much about children, but he knew they got sick a lot easier than adolescents. Must be their weaker immune system, or something. Would Lance be susceptible to things like colds and fevers? More importantly, why did he care?\n\u201cThese cribs look like they\u2019re in pretty good condition, though,\u201d Hunk, ever the pacifier, said. He heaved one upright and dusted it down with a spare cloth, looking pleased with himself. \u201cThis is what babies sleep in, right? Lance will be fine in it?\u201d\nShiro nodded. \u201cI think so,\u201d he said. \u201cI really don\u2019t have much experience with children, though\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem that way,\u201d Hunk said, laughing. Keith was inclined to agree. \u201cLance likes you the most!\u201d\nA small smile came to Shiro\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ve only tried to give him to Allura,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWho knows, he might end up liking Keith the best.\u201d\nKeith grimaced. \u201cWhat? Please, no. I hate kids.\u201d\nHe only received laughter for his distaste. He went back to repairing panels on the wall that had been dislodged with a sour scowl. Why didn\u2019t they believe him? He hadn\u2019t made any move to touch Lance, and he\u2019d never been particularly friendly with anything smaller than him, Pidge excluded. The only reason he was helping clear out the nursery was because Shiro had told him to.\n\u201cThere we go,\u201d Shiro said, gently lowering Lance into the clean crib after they\u2019d finished clearing out the room. \u201cHow\u2019s that, Lance? All good?\u201d\nLance whimpered when Shiro drew his arms away. It was a strange sound to hear, one that drew immediately Keith\u2019s attention. Did all babies make such sad sounds? Was it a Lance thing? He thought babies were meant to be happy and drooling, or something. Not sad.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t he like it?\u201d Hunk asked, peering over into the crib. Curious, Keith crept closer, giving the crib an analytical look. Lance was looking up at them all, eyes wide and watery, as they watched him sit in the crib. He didn\u2019t seem to hate it, but he didn\u2019t seem to like it, either. It made Keith\u2019s head hurt just thinking about it.\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just tired,\u201d Pidge said. He reached in a hand to rub his knuckles over Lance\u2019s cheek and grinned when Lance\u2019s attention turned away from the lack-of-Shiro to him. \u201cMy neighbour had a kid recently, and she always cries when she\u2019s tired.\u201d\nA beeping through their helmets signalled Allura opening the communication lines. \u201cWe\u2019re approaching a planet where we can gather supplies,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we cannot dock near them, and we cannot stay for long. You\u2019ll have to take a passenger pod to the surface.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Shiro answered. \u201cHunk, do you know what food we can give a child?\u201d\nHunk nodded. \u201cShould do.\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll come with me,\u201d Shiro said. \u201cPidge, do you remember what clothes your neighbour\u2019s child wore?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Keith asked.\n\u201cYou stay here with Lance,\u201d Shiro answered. \n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\n\u201cSomeone needs to,\u201d Shiro said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Keith, you\u2019ll have Coran and Allura with you. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cActually, I\u2019ll come with you,\u201d Coran interjected. \u201cWe need more supplies for us, as well.\u201d \nKeith frowned. \u201cBut Lance doesn\u2019t even like Allura!\u201d He said. He winced at the wording \u2013 he wasn\u2019t good at  feelings  and making sure not to hurt them \u2013 but shook it off. \u201cNot to mention he probably doesn\u2019t like me, either. He only likes you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Shiro repeated, firmer. \u201cJust hold him if he cries, and if that doesn\u2019t work, try feeding him or changing him-\u201d\n\n \u201cChanging?\u201d \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d Allura said. \u201cGet to the passenger pod and I\u2019ll send you down. Hurry now.\u201d\nAfter casting Keith a last look, Shiro and the others left. Keith was filled with a weird, uncomfortable feeling as both he and Lance watched the rest of the team exit. Soon enough, the only people in the room were them. Could people leave babies alone? Would Lance die if he left him to sit in the crib until Shiro got back? Just thinking about it made him wince. \n\u201cAllura, do you know how to take care of children?\u201d He asked.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around Altean children, if that is what you\u2019re asking me,\u201d she answered. \u201cHuman children seem far\u2026 fussier.\u201d\nHe groaned. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said, frustrated. \u201cYou come take him.\u201d\n\u201cCalm yourself, Keith,\u201d she advised, sighing. \u201cIs he causing trouble?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s just sitting there,\u201d Keith groused. \u201cAre children meant to just sit there? He looks like he\u2019s going to start crying.\u201d\n\u201cBring him up into the control room,\u201d Allura said. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably be calmer around more people.\u201d\n\u201cHow am I meant to do that?\u201d\n\u201cPick him up.\u201d\nKeith was silent for a moment. \u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cKeith do not make me come down there just to show you how to hold a child.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if he cries?\u201d\n\u201cThen  comfort him,\u201d  she huffed, before disconnecting the communication line. Keith gave the quiet line an irritated scowl before turning back to face Lance. He was startled to find that Lance was staring at him. In any other situation he would have thought he had something on his face.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he said quietly, \u201clet\u2019s make a deal. You don\u2019t cry, and I won\u2019t drop you. How\u2019s that sound?\u201d\nLance\u2019s gaze only became more persistent. A pucker appeared in his brows as he stared, utterly focused. \nKeith hesitated once before leaning over the edge of the crib. \u201cEasy, easy,\u201d he muttered, slipping his hands under Lance\u2019s armpits. He was surprisingly  soft  \u2013 sure, Lance had a beauty routine to rival all beauty routines, but this was different. When he lifted Lance, he was heavier than Keith had expected, and there wasn\u2019t any muscle tension in his little body. \u201cFloppy,\u201d Keith said to himself as he lifted Lance to his eye level. \u201cWhy are you floppy?\u201d\nLance frowned at him and whined. His limbs flailed and it was so unexpected that Keith nearly dropped him. His grip tightened on Lance and Lance let out an uncomfortable cry that made a deep, hidden part of Keith panic. He didn\u2019t want Lance to cry because of  him.  He quickly readjusted his grip on Lance, trying to mimic the way Shiro held him. He supported Lance\u2019s head when he felt like it would just roll off and settled him in the crook of his arm. Lance didn\u2019t fit there as well as he fit in Shiro\u2019s arms, but it was workable. \nIt was hard to walk and carry a squirming child at the same time. Lance kept making these noises and Keith didn\u2019t know what they could possibly mean. Eventually he shifted his hold on Lance, settling him on his hip instead. That seemed to please Lance a bit more, who then returned to staring.\nIt was reassuring to know that even as a child, Lance was the weirdest person Keith knew. \nAllura was standing by the control panel as she watched the pod descend into the atmosphere of the planet they were docked near. It was nothing but a small, glowing light now. \u201cHe seems calmer,\u201d she remarked as Keith walked closer.\n\u201cThen take him,\u201d Keith said, irritated. \n\u201cWill he cry?\u201d\n\u201cHow am I meant to know? Just take him.\u201d\nHesitantly, Allura took Lance into her arms. He let out an unhappy noise but quietened when Allura rocked him. \u201cAt least he didn't cry this time,\u201d she said, relieved. \u201cI must admit, he is rather cute, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nKeith flushed. \u201cWhat? No. No, definitely not.\u201d\nAllura chuckled. \u201cIf you say so,\u201d she said as she turned back to face the view outside the castle. \u201cSee out there, Lance? Isn\u2019t it pretty?\u201d\nKeith frowned. That was baby talk. They were talking to a baby. He just couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around it, and as much as he was constantly irritated by Lance, the sooner he returned to normal, the better.\n\u00a0\nShiro, Pidge, Hunk and Coran returned from the planet later that evening. They carried in bags of clothing and food and things to restock the Castle\u2019s nursery, like bottles and blankets and even a few, small children\u2019s toys. \n\u201cWhy is he crying?\u201d Shiro asked. He dumped the bags by the entryway into the common room in favour of scooping Lance up from where he was seated on the couch.\n\u201cHow am I meant to know?\u201d Keith growled back. \u201cHe just won\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cWe tried to place him down and he starting crying,\u201d Allura explained. She looked a little frazzled, though not as much as Keith surely did, and worriedly fiddled with both her hands. \u201cI tried feeding him and holding him like you said, but he hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d\nA frown touched Shiro\u2019s face. He heaved Lance higher up into one of his arms and reached for the bags again. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go change him and see if that helps,\u201d he said.\nSilence finally reached the room and Keith couldn\u2019t be gladder. He fell against one of the couches and groaned, rubbing his temples. Lance\u2019s cries were loud and piercing, but there was something more than that that bothered him. Those cries clawed at his mind and persisted in his ears and he felt a surge of helplessness overcome him, one he hadn\u2019t ever felt before. He felt incredibly  responsible,  and it wasn\u2019t pleasant, because he didn't know why he felt that way.\n\u201cIs Keith alright?\u201d Hunk asked Allura quietly. \u201cHe seems upset.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2026 I am unsure,\u201d Allura answered, just as quiet. \u201cI think this situation is just very taxing on him. Lance kept reaching out for us as well, and neither of us knew how to react\u2026 I feel very useless. I wish to help Lance, but I do not know how.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Hunk comforted, \u201cwe\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\nHunk and Coran disappeared into the kitchens to put away the food and Allura took care of the things that went to the nursery. Pidge took a seat across from him and tossed him a water bottle that he\u2019d grabbed from one of the bags. \u201cYou alright?\u201d\n\u201cMy head hurts,\u201d Keith muttered. He drank half the water bottle before recapping it and putting it aside. \u201cLance is louder than ever.\u201d\n\u201cI think he\u2019s just scared,\u201d Pidge said. \u201cI mean, who knows if he still has his normal mind or not?\u201d\nKeith hummed.\n\u201cHey, do you remember when we were sharing memories,\u201d Pidge hesitated before shaking his head. \u201cDo you remember what Lance\u2019s was?\u201d\nKeith frowned. He hadn\u2019t paid much attention to Lance when they were doing that, and he hadn\u2019t been interested in rooting around in Lance\u2019s head. The pressure of learning to form Voltron had been distracting, but still\u2026 There was a faint memory in his mind of a family. \u201cYeah? What of it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, do you think that Lance was ever left alone as a kid?\u201d Pidge asked. \u201cI mean, his family is  huge.  He has a lot of siblings, and aunts and uncles and stuff. Maybe that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t want to be put down.\u201d\nKeith didn\u2019t understand that. He didn\u2019t really have a family, and the concept of living with such a large amount of people was very foreign. He appreciated his alone time and didn\u2019t understand why people would willingly give theirs up to extensively socialise. Besides, why would a baby want that? Keith thought that a baby would want to be put down so they could crawl around and destroy things.\nHe didn\u2019t say any of that, though. He didn\u2019t think it would be well received.\nA moment later, Shiro came back into the room carrying Lance, who was now wearing a tiny sweater and striped pants. Shiro had slanted a beanie on his head to keep his ears warm and little socks on his feet, though one had been half wrestled off. \u201cThe clothes fit well,\u201d he remarked, pleased, as he took a seat beside Keith. \u201cHe seems happier now.\u201d\nLance craned his head back to peer at Pidge. He seemed surprised to find himself back in the room he was in before, and squirmed in Shiro\u2019s grip. Shiro held him by the waist as Lance stood in his lap, and then suddenly Lance\u2019s head whipped to the side and he resumed his furious staring at Keith. \n\u201cWhy does he do that?\u201d Keith demanded. \u201cHe keeps staring at me.\u201d\nShiro laughed. \u201cMaybe he just doesn\u2019t like your hair,\u201d he teased. \nKeith held back a glare. \nLance only made a huffing noise at him, squirming in Shiro\u2019s grip again. He didn\u2019t seem like he wanted Shiro to let go of him \u2013 more like he was content to be held. Keith thought that out of all of them, Shiro was probably the most parental. Somewhere along the way he\u2019d slipped straight into a leader role for the Paladins and he did tend to have the calmest temperament. \nWhen dinner time rolled around, Shiro held Lance on his lap as they sat around the dining table. Hunk had prepared the food they bought for Lance and as it cooled down they ate their own meals. Shiro had tried to feed Lance a spoonful of the green goo that Alteans favoured but Lance had rejected it with a disgusted sound.\n\u201cWhat exactly did you buy for him?\u201d Allura asked after Lance had rejected the food. \n\u201cWell, on Earth, infants and young children are mostly fed breastmilk, pureed vegetables and fruit, and sometimes soft solids like bread and biscuits. For mothers that don\u2019t breastfeed there is a powdered formula with the same nutritional content that can be mixed with water to form milk,\u201d Hunk explained. \u201cAnd before you ask, I did have to look that up.\u201d\n\u201cWe feed our children something similar, I believe,\u201d Allura nodded.\n\u201cWe found something like baby formula that he might be able to stomach,\u201d Hunk said, gesturing to the bottle being cooled on the tabletop. \u201cAnd we found these weird alien fruits that I\u2019ll puree tomorrow, too. He should like them, and I already tried one, so they\u2019re safe to eat.\u201d\nWhen the bottle had finally cooled enough so that it would not burn Lance\u2019s mouth, Shiro pushed his plate away and had Lance sit on one of his knees. While Lance did seem strong enough to hold the bottle up on his own, he didn\u2019t seem to have the energy to do so, and instead Shiro did. Thankfully, Lance drank from it with nothing more than a scrunched up nose at the taste.\n\u201cThe nursery is set up, right?\u201d Shiro asked.\nAllura nodded again. \u201cYes, there is a crib and blankets waiting for him,\u201d she said. \u201cI repaired one of the security cameras to monitor him and hooked it up to feed straight into your helmets in case he starts to cry. Do you think he is old enough to sleep through the night?\u201d\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll find out,\u201d Shiro said. \nDinner passed relatively uneventfully after that. Lance drank the whole bottle before dozing quietly in the crook of Shiro\u2019s elbow while the rest of them finished their meal. Even though Keith kept telling himself he didn\u2019t care, he couldn\u2019t help but watch Lance out of the corner of his eye. When he wasn\u2019t crying or whining, he looked kind of\u2026 kind of cute?\n\n Alright, let\u2019s not go there. \n\nStill, when it came time for them all to go to bed, Keith found himself following Shiro and Allura down to the nursery. Lance was all but asleep in Shiro\u2019s arms but he stirred when Shiro lowered him into the crib. He made a small, inquisitive noise and reached out a little hand for Shiro again, but Shiro only pulled the blankets up over him and straightened.\nAs he walked out of the nursery to join Keith and Allura, Lance started to cry. At first they were tentative, searching sniffles before they became outright wails that produced the same, clawing effect in Keith\u2019s brain. It had him wincing, and for some strange reason, he was reminded of how Lance\u2019s weight had felt in his arms.\n If he held him, he would stop crying, right?\n\n No, no that\u2019s not my job. He\u2019ll just cry himself to sleep, that\u2019s what babies do. \n\n\u201cWill he cry all night?\u201d Allura asked, concerned, after they\u2019d waited several minutes outside the door. \u201cHe\u2019s really working himself up\u2026\u201d\nShiro frowned. \u201cYou said we should avoid letting him cry, right? Maybe it would be better if we moved the crib into one of our rooms for the night.\u201d\nAllura hummed thoughtfully. \u201cThat might work, actually, though I do not think it would be wise to leave him with either Coran or myself. You said it yourself \u2013 we do not share the same bond that you, as fellow Paladins, do. Would you be willing to take him, Shiro?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, but I don\u2019t think I can take him every night,\u201d Shiro said. \u201cI\u2019m still unsure about this whole situation myself, and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Allura said.\nKeith was pretty sure he knew what Shiro was going to say. Shiro still experienced stress from what had happened to him while he had been captured by the Galra, and he probably had nightmares. If he had an episode while Lance was crying he might not be able to help, or he might unintentionally lash out. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll make a roster system, then,\u201d Allura said.\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d\n\u201cEveryone will have to pitch in, Keith,\u201d Shiro reminded him gently.\nKeith wanted to argue more, but another loud wail from Lance made him shut his mouth.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take him tonight,\u201d Shiro said. \u201cAllura, can you go tell the others what we\u2019ve decided? Pidge and Hunk will need to know.\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\n\u201cKeith, you\u2019ll need to carry Lance,\u201d Shiro said. \u201cI\u2019ll carry the crib.\u201d\nKeith winced. He probably should have gone to his room, but some part of him was glad he had the opportunity to hold Lance again. He would be sure to bury that part into oblivion later, but for now he silently followed Shiro back into the nursery.\nShiro lifted Lance out of the crib and soothed him until his cries became nothing more than petulant grizzles. He wiped Lance\u2019s damp cheeks dry with the edge of his shirt before carefully passing him over to Keith. \u201cMake sure you support him,\u201d Shiro said, \u201cso that he doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s doing to fall. Hold his head if you can.\u201d\nAs Shiro put extra blankets in the crib, Keith adjusted his hold on Lance. He ended up supporting Lance against his chest as he leaned back a little, with Lance\u2019s head resting on his collarbones. Soft tufts of Lance\u2019s hair were ticking his cheek but he paid no mind to it. With one arm he supported the majority of Lance\u2019s weight and with the either he used his hand to cradle the back of Lance\u2019s head.  His hair really is soft\u2026  \nShiro carried the crib through the hallways with little effort. \u201cI know you and Lance don\u2019t always get along the best,\u201d he started, \u201cbut I really appreciate your help, and I\u2019m sure he will too.\u201d\nIt was an odd thing for Shiro to say, so Keith gave him a considerate look. \u201cYou feel responsible,\u201d he concluded.\nShiro sighed. \u201cI should have known that the monster was going to explode,\u201d he murmured. \u201cLance knew, and he threw himself over it. If he hadn\u2019t we all would be like him and Allura and Coran would have no way to care for us.\u201d\nKeith was quiet for a moment. He didn\u2019t know how to respond to that, so he didn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m not changing any nappies,\u201d he said.\nShiro laughed. \u201cAlright, alright,\u201d he said, before grinning. \u201cWe\u2019ll make Coran do it.\u201d\nEven though Lance had slept in Shiro\u2019s room throughout the night \u2013 and consequently cried in Shiro\u2019s room \u2013 Keith got little to no sleep. He blamed it on Lance\u2019s crying, but he knew that that wasn\u2019t the reason why he\u2019d been unable to sleep. Sure, he could hear Lance\u2019s crying through the walls of the rooms, but it was very muted. \nHe didn\u2019t really know why sleep evaded him, but he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Lance. It felt different to spend a day without Lance\u2019s constant commentary and tasteless jokes and his general harassing of Allura. Keith couldn\u2019t say he missed it \u2013  he definitely didn\u2019t miss it  \u00ac\u2013 but the castle seemed very different without it. Empty wasn\u2019t quite the right word, because there were certainly enough people around to make it seem full, but Keith didn\u2019t know how else to describe it. He couldn\u2019t explain what it felt like, and it was frustrating.\nWhen morning came, he was grouchy and unrested but desperate to see Lance again. Just like everything else that desire was unexplainable, and after a while he just stopped questioning it. He wanted to eat and train and get back to doing what he was meant to as the Red Paladin.\nHunk was already serving breakfast with Coran\u2019s help when Keith finally took his seat. Allura was seated at the head of the table as per usual, and Pidge arrived soon after Keith. \u201cI wonder how Shiro is doing,\u201d Pidge said as he slid into his seat. \u201cI wonder if he got any sleep. I heard Lance cry a few times during the night.\u201d\n\u201cSo did I,\u201d Keith grumbled. Maybe if they thought he was angry over his lack of sleep they wouldn\u2019t realise he was angry because of Lance\u2019s current state.\nShiro came in just after Coran had finished laying out the food. He didn\u2019t look exceptionally tired but he wasn\u2019t wearing his uniform and his hair wasn\u2019t as brushed as he usually kept it. He carried Lance in his arms, who was now dressed in a blue shirt and black pants. Somehow Shiro had managed to wrestle him into a tiny striped sweater with a little hood to keep his head warm, but Lance had already pulled it down.\n\u201cGood morning, Shiro,\u201d Allura greeted him. \u201cHow did the night go?\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Shiro answered. \u201cHe had a tough time going to sleep and I think he got a little frustrated with himself. He woke once for food but after he had been fed he slept better. I think he\u2019ll only wake once a night so long as he gets to sleep okay.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Allura said, sighing. \u201cI\u2019m glad. I created the roster last night, and I thought it might be best if we keep a schedule of the times we feed him. I looked into human children a little and although my resources were slim, it seems that they function better emotionally when placed in a structured routine.\u201d\nThe data screen flickered out of a projector that appeared from the arm of their chairs. Keith leaned forwards to read it. Shiro was scheduled to take Lance first, which he had, and then it was Pidge, Hunk, and himself. Why was he last? It meant that for the seven nights they predicted Lance would be stuck like this, everyone would have him for two nights, except for Keith. Did they not trust him, or something? \nHe didn\u2019t like being last, even in matters like this.\nAt least he didn\u2019t seem like the only once concerned. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to care for a child properly,\u201d Pidge said, frowning. \u201cI don\u2019t have any experience\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Shiro said. He took a seat and rested Lance on his knee again, who instantly started reaching across the table to paw at Shiro\u2019s breakfast. \u201cAs long as he doesn\u2019t start to cry, he\u2019s actually quite placid. He just wants to be around people.\u201d\nPidge made a disbelieving noise but didn\u2019t speak on the matter again. \n\u201cShiro, what do you think would be best for us to do while we wait for Lance to return to normal?\u201d Allura asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t form Voltron without him, but you can still train without Lance, if you are willing.\u201d\n\u201cI think it would be best to carry on as usual,\u201d Shiro said. He absently pulled his bowl out of Lance\u2019s reach and instead took the bottle of baby formula Hunk offered him. \u201cAt least, as much as we can.\u201d\nAllura nodded. \u201cAlright. We\u2019ll have breakfast and then you can return to the training deck.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019ll mind Lance?\u201d Keith asked. He flushed when all eyes turned to him and forced a frown. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like we can take him into the training room. He\u2019s useless.\u201d\n\n Way to go, Keith. Now you sound heartless. Great. \n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll watch him while you all change into your suits,\u201d Allura said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll see how he reacts to being in the control room.\u201d\nIt was a sound plan, so with that decided they returned to eating their meal. It was as strange as ever, Keith thought, even with Hunk\u2019s cooking. He missed the food from Earth, however tasteless and bland it had often been. He didn\u2019t like that he was getting used to alien food, even though he didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter.\nAt least Lance didn\u2019t seem to mind. Keith glanced at him as much as he could while remaining subtle about it and found that Lance seemed perfectly content with what he was being given. Shiro fed Lance first, making sure he\u2019d had the whole bottle before touching his own breakfast. It was hard to believe he\u2019d never had experience with children before with the gentle way he cared for Lance. \nBreakfast continued on relatively uneventfully. Lance was passed to Allura with only a minimum amount of sniffles and unhappy noises, but he quietened when she distracted him with a dangling bracelet she wore. \nAfter changing into his suit, Keith returned to the training deck. When everyone had arrived, Shiro gestured them all over. \u201cLet\u2019s treat this as a good opportunity to practice without the entire team present,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t always be close to each other in battle, after all. Allura is going to send the combat dummies down and we\u2019ll see how it goes, okay?\u201d\nKeith glanced up at them through the windows into the control room. He could make out Allura and Coran\u2019s figures as they stood before the control panels. Allura was clearly holding Lance and Keith had to fight back the bitter feeling that rose in him. Why couldn\u2019t he hold Lance instead? He trained more than the other Paladins, he could afford to miss one training session.\n\n Wait, no, that\u2019s not right. I don\u2019t care about Lance. I can\u2019t miss a training session! \n\nThe dummies were lowered onto the deck a moment later. There were five \u2013 one for each of them, if Lance wasn\u2019t currently being useless. He probably would have been just as useless if he were there anyway, in Keith\u2019s opinion. \n\u201cThis is only training level one, so you should just breeze through it,\u201d Allura said over the speakers. \u201cAs each simulation is complete, the difficulty will rise. Good luck, Paladins.\u201d\nKeith activated his bayard. The weight of the red sword was comfortable in his hands and he found that holding it helped clear the jitteriness in his head. As the training dummy raised its own weapon, he struck. The clash of the blades rang in his ears but it sounded far away; his body fell easily into the routine of battle.\nHe swung his bayard up through the chest of the dummy and instantly it was swallowed by the floor. He heard the sounds of the other dummies falling and spun to see that four had already been taken care of. The last was taking a swing at Pidge so he ducked forwards and drove his sword through its stomach.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Pidge said, breathless, as he lowered his bayard. \n\u201cNo problem.\u201d\n\u201cTraining level two is beginning,\u201d Allura said.\nSeven dummies dropped from the ceiling this time. They were faster to attack and swung wide blows packed with more weight so Keith didn\u2019t hesitate. He ran for the nearest one and with a cry he swung his blade up. The dummy blocked it but wasn\u2019t fast enough to deflect Keith\u2019s second blow aimed beneath its raised arms. It went down with a loud thump and was swallowed by the floor just like the first had been.\nA second came after him when his back was turned. He let out a grunt as it knocked him across the floor and scrambled to get his feet back under him. Shiro had already taken out two of them and both Pidge and Hunk had taken care of one each, leaving just the last dummy that was now advancing on Keith. He gritted his teeth and charged at it, raising his bayard to block its swing. When he suddenly spun away the momentum caused the dummy to tip forwards, and before it could regain its footing he thrust his blade through it.\n\u201cWell done,\u201d Shiro said as they caught their breath. \u201cAllura, we\u2019re ready for training level three.\u201d\n\u201cI- I apologise,\u201d Allura\u2019s voice came out strained through the speakers. \u201cIt seems like Lance is not pleased with it.\u201d\nShiro frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d\nAllura opened the speakers again and through them came Lance\u2019s unhappy cries. Keith couldn\u2019t see him or Allura that well anymore but he had no doubt that Lance was doing that flailing thing again. \u201cHe\u2019s getting too worked up,\u201d Allura said, tense. \u201cI think he believes you are in danger. I cannot distract him any longer.\u201d\nShiro sighed. \u201cAlright, one of us is going to need to babysit him while we continue training,\u201d he said as the glow in his metal hand disappeared. \u201cWe\u2019ll take turns throughout the day \u2013 I\u2019ll go now, so make sure you continue training, alright?\u201d\nKeith hid a frown as Shiro left the training deck. That weird, bitter feeling was coming back but he shoved it down again.\n\u201cUh, are we going to be fine on our own?\u201d Hunk asked, concerned.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Keith snapped. \u201cJust don\u2019t mess up.\"\n\u00a0\n\u201cKeith, make sure you  focus,\u201d  Shiro said through the speakers. \u201cYou\u2019re not maintaining awareness of your team.\u201d\nKeith growled under his breath. \u201cI am!\u201d He argued. \u201cThey\u2019re not paying enough attention to me!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going too fast!\u201d Pidge shouted back at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t take on all of the dummies by yourself!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going too  slow.\u201d \n\u201cKeith! Don\u2019t lose focus!\u201d\nKeith let out an irritated growl as he swung his bayard around. It carved up through a dummy but the momentum of it had him stumbling and he hit the ground hard. Another dummy slammed its blade straight into the floor and Keith only narrowly dodged it before Hunk took the dummy out. \nHe didn\u2019t know why he was distracted, but it was pissing him off. Every now and then he\u2019d hear Lance garble something over the speakers and it drove him insane. Why couldn\u2019t Shiro just keep him quiet? \n\n \u201cKeith!\u201d \n\nHe let out a sharp cry when a dummy sent him flying across the room. The blow seemed to shake him to the very bones and although he\u2019d certainly suffered worse he knew get an ugly bruise by evening. It only served to make him more irritated at himself.\nThe training simulation was turned off after that. Keith was left riled up and full of unfocused energy, and without anywhere for it to go he went one more round once everyone had cleared out. By the time he had finished and cooled down, the rest of the team had moved to the dining room for lunch.\n\u201cHe just wouldn\u2019t settle down,\u201d Allura was explaining as they sat around the table. \u201cI think he was frightened.\u201d\nShiro nodded. He was standing by the table but Lance was sitting in his seat, oddly quiet. \u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t like violence.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite possible,\u201d Allura agreed. \u201cHe is just a child, after all. We shall try the maze exercise after lunch, instead.\u201d\nHunk cooked pureed fruits for Lance this time. Shiro sat Lance on his lap so that Lance could reach the table and gave him a little spoon to play around with. Keith petulantly stirred around his own food as he watched Lance make a mess of himself. Were babies always like that? He didn\u2019t know, but he couldn\u2019t look away. He didn\u2019t even care if anyone noticed him staring \u2013 glaring \u2013 anymore.\n\u00a0\nThe maze exercise went just as badly as the training dummies. It was Hunk who held Lance this time as Shiro tried to fit in extra training and Allura returned to the main deck to take care of the castle\u2019s travel. Lance simply wouldn\u2019t settle, no matter how much Hunk distracted him. Any time one of them ran into a wall he would only get more and more upset.\nThey didn\u2019t usually run into walls anymore, not since they\u2019d starting forming Voltron and their teamwork had improved. Keith wouldn\u2019t admit it, but he seemed to be the only one distracted enough to actually get shocked. By the third time he\u2019d shocked himself, Shiro decided to call it off. \n\u201cLet\u2019s return to the common room,\u201d he sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ll find something else to do.\u201d\nKeith wasn\u2019t the only one agitated. They all liked to do their own thing \u2013 train, cook, mess around with machines in the lab \u2013 and this Lance situation wasn\u2019t making it any easier. \n\u201cWe have to figure out what\u2019s bothering him, fix it, and then return to normal,\u201d Pidge decided as they all took a seat on the couches. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t like this yesterday.\u201d\nLance had been set down on the couch between Shiro and Keith. He was frowning at them all furiously and making these noises that almost sounded like words. His eyes were still watery and his cheeks were red, like he was going to start crying again. He\u2019d pulled one of his socks off and was working on the other as they talked, completely oblivious.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not hungry,\u201d Pidge said, ticking it off with his fingers, \u201che won\u2019t sleep, and he doesn\u2019t need to be changed. What else could it be?\u201d\nLance made a troubled noise again and turned his big blue eyes on Keith.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Keith demanded. \u201cWhy do you keep staring at me like that, huh?\u201d\nShiro just shook his head. \u201cMaybe we can use those memory helmets to see what\u2019s bothering him,\u201d he suggested. \u201cThough I don\u2019t know if Lance will appreciate us rooting around in his mind like that.\u201d\n\u201cWould that even work? He has to be thinking about it for us to see,\u201d Pidge pointed out. \u201cI might be able to fiddle with it, though.\u201d\nShiro glanced away.\nIt did seem like a real invasion of privacy. Lance\u2019s memories were probably very unguarded and unfiltered, and there might be things he didn\u2019t want them to know laid out plain to see. As much as Keith was irritated by Lance, he didn\u2019t feel all that comfortable breaching such an impassable line. \n\u201cEif!\u201d Lance suddenly cried.\nKeith jumped at the sudden shout. Lance was still staring at him, mouth puckered into a pout.  What the hell was that? \n\u201cDid he just talk?\u201d Hunk asked, eyebrows raised in surprise. \u201cCan he talk?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Shiro frowned. \u201cChildren that age should be able to vocalise things though, right?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he saying?\u201d Keith demanded. \u201cAnd why won\u2019t he quite staring at me? It\u2019s creepy!\u201d\n\u201cEif!\u201d Lance cried again. He pushed himself upright and wobbled on his feet, ignoring the way Shiro\u2019s hands jumped to support him around the waist. \u201cEif!\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t make sense. That wasn\u2019t a word, was it? It just seemed like a sound. \n\u201cIs Lance speaking?\u201d Allura asked as she walked into the room. Her eyes were wide with surprise. \u201cHe can stand, too?\u201d\nShiro turned to glance at her, his hands cautiously lowering away from Lance. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying,\u201d he explained.\nLance startled to wobble across the couch. The cushions were stiff enough to offer some support and although his first few steps were shaky he quickly gained confidence. Keith stiffened from his head to his toes as Lance toddled towards him before abruptly falling against his thighs. \u201cKeif!\u201d He declared.\n\u201cHe\u2019s saying your name,\u201d Allura exclaimed. \u201cDid you teach him that, Shiro?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Shiro shook his head. He had this weird smile on his face that made Keith feel flustered and irritated. \u201cHe must have heard me shouting it out all day and associated it with Keith.\u201d\nLance reached for the sleeve of Keith\u2019s jacket and feel across his lap with a quiet oof sound. \u201cKeif, Keif.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s hands twitched. \u201cWhat do I do-\u201d\n\u201cJust play along,\u201d Shiro laughed. \u201cSee, I told you he\u2019d like you the best.\u201d\nKeith scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s because I kept messing up today!\u201d He argued. \u201cHe would learn anything being repeated a dozen times.\u201d To prove his point he tilted Lance\u2019s chin in his direction. \u201cSay Pidge, Lance.  Pi-dge.  Pidge.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why me?\u201d Pidge complained.\n\u201cIdge,\u201d Lance repeated, before scowling. \u201cKeif.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s just copying you now, Keith,\u201d Hunk chuckled. \u201cLook at that, he likes to copy you! You\u2019re even wearing the same expressions.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s scowl worsened.\nSo did Lance\u2019s.\n\u201cStop staring at me,\u201d Keith said to Lance. He didn\u2019t like all this attention being placed directly on him. It was embarrassing. \u201cShiro, take him back, I don\u2019t want him anymore.\u201d\nShiro laughed again. \u201cHe\u2019s harmless, Keith.\u201d\n\u201cTake him!\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright, hand him over.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShiro pushed the crib into Pidge\u2019s room after dinner. Keith trailed along after him without meaning to, silently eyeing Pidge. He\u2019d been given Lance to hold for the first time as Shiro moved the crib, and Keith had to hold back his urge to correct Pidge\u2019s grip on Lance. Didn\u2019t he knew he needed to support Lance\u2019s head better? It was too floppy on its own.\n\u201cAlright, he should go to sleep easy now that he\u2019s had something to eat,\u201d Shiro said as he took Lance from Pidge. He cradled Lance in the crook of his arms until Lance\u2019s eyes began to drift shut. \u201cAs long as nothing wakes him, he should wake up once at three for another feed and then go back to sleep until morning.\u201d\n\u201cWhy does that sound like that could go wrong really easily?\u201d Pidge muttered.\n\u201cBecause it can,\u201d Shiro said calmly, \u201cbut we\u2019ll try our best to make sure it won\u2019t. If you need any help just come get me, alright? Hunk said he left a bottle of formula in the kitchen so it just needs to be reheated and cooled.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if it\u2019s too hot and I burn his mouth?\u201d\n\u201cTest it against your inner wrist.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if he gets cold?\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t; he\u2019s dressed warmly and he has his blankets and the interior temperature of the castle is regulated. You know that, Pidge.\u201d\n\u201cBut what if-\u201d\n \u201cPidge,\u201d  Shiro said, \u201cyou\u2019ll be fine, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just one night.\u201d\nPidge didn\u2019t look convinced. Keith knew that Pidge probably slept the least out of all of them \u2013 he was always down in the lab or in the hangers working on something. He seemed more in tune with machines than with children, and even Shiro\u2019s reassurance wasn\u2019t comforting him. Wouldn\u2019t it be easier for someone else to take Lance for the night? Someone who was a little less worried about the fragility of him?\nSomeone like Keith, perhaps?\n\n I must be tired if I\u2019m thinking that\u2026 Why am I thinking that? \n\nKeith shook his head at himself. Shiro was lowering Lance into the crib but Lance\u2019s eyes hadn\u2019t completely shut yet. They were a darker blue than they had been before, coloured with tiredness, and they watched Keith as he retreated from the room. With one last look at Lance, taken when he knew no one was watching him, Keith left.\nSomething woke Keith during the very early morning the next day. At first he couldn\u2019t figure out what it was that roused him, but as he fully emerged from sleep he realised that there were noises in the corridor. They were muted at first, but they became clearer the more he listened. He instinctively reached for his bayard and kept it held tightly in his hand as he slipped out of bed.\nThe sound of footsteps echoed through the door when Keith pressed his ear to it. They were familiar footsteps, ones that he\u2019d memorised since he starting living in the castle, and with an exhale Keith lowered his weapon. He knew who belonged to those footsteps and when he opened his door, his thoughts were confirmed. \u201cPidge, why are you wandering around out here in the middle of the night?\u201d\nPidge stiffened at his voice and cast Keith a wary glance. \u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d\nKeith frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s Lance? Why aren\u2019t you with him?\u201d\nPidge scowled. It was a look that held the same kind of nervous tension Pidge used to get before officially announcing that he was not born as a male to them. That look that made Keith back off, made him let Pidge move down the hallway without any more questions. \u201cShiro has him,\u201d was all Pidge said as he left.\nKeith watched him leave in the direction of the labs before turning back to his own room. If Pidge didn\u2019t want to tell him what had happened, that was fine. Keith had a feeling that Pidge was just too nervous to be responsible for Lance. He didn\u2019t blame him; Keith himself still felt a little like that, too. Keith had fallen asleep easier that night, but now he felt wide awake. Even when he laid back down in bed and closed his eyes his thoughts would not still. Had Lance been crying? Was he sick? He was safe, wasn\u2019t he? Of course he was, Shiro had him. But\u2026 He shook his head.\nThey  weren\u2019t  his problems to worry about, so he tried to sleep instead.\n\u00a0\nBreakfast came and went the next morning and Shiro did not appear. Keith ate with more aggression than usual and scowled into his food like it had offended him. No one asked him why he was agitated, but he thought it was frustratingly obvious. Why hadn\u2019t Shiro come to eat with them like he always did? He\u2019d never missed a meal before, at least not without telling them. More importantly, why hadn\u2019t he brought Lance back to the group? Lance needed to eat, too.\n\u201cPerhaps we should go check on him,\u201d Allura suggested as they cleared away the plates. Shiro\u2019s was left full and untouched.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Keith said without thinking. He received surprised stares for his efforts but left before anyone could mention it. He didn\u2019t need them making him feel any more awkward than he already did. \nShiro didn\u2019t answer when Keith knocked on his door. Keith waited several moments just for propriety\u2019s sake before entering. He expected to see Lance\u2019s crib pushed into the room, but it wasn\u2019t there. Shiro was stretched out across his bed on his back, and that was where Lance slept, too \u2013 curled up on Shiro\u2019s chest with a tiny blanket thrown over him. Shiro had one arm stretched behind his head and the other holding onto Lance like a second blanket. His hand encompassed the entirety of Lance\u2019s back.\nKeith felt odd, like he was intruding, and tried not to wince. \u201cShiro,\u201d he said, reaching for Shiro\u2019s shoulder, \u201cwake up. It\u2019s past breakfast time.\u201d\nShiro woke with a startle, blinking sleep out of his eyes. \u201cKeith\u2026? Oh, I overslept.\u201d\nKeith nodded. He hesitated for a moment, heart racing, before asking, \u201cWant me to take Lance?\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Keith,\u201d Shiro sighed as he lowered his hand away from Lance. Keith watched it move before his eyes went back to Lance, who hadn\u2019t stirred. Was he meant to just pick him up? What if Lance started to cry? He didn\u2019t want Lance to cry.\nLance felt exceptionally warm when Keith gripped him under the armpits. He made a quiet, mumbling noise as he was lifted but didn\u2019t sniffle. His knees curled up and his hands closed into fists as his eyebrows began to draw in. As quickly as he dared, Keith pulled Lance up into his arms, resting Lance\u2019s head in the crook of his neck. Lance fidgeted once and gripped a fistful of Lance\u2019s shirt before settling again.\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Keith muttered to himself as he carefully walked out of the room. \u201cSame deal as before. You don\u2019t cry, and I won\u2019t drop you. Sound good?\u201d\nLance only made another noise at it. There weren\u2019t any discernible words in his mumbling, but Keith still felt like it was more of a conversation than what he usually got with this particular Paladin. \n\u201cIs Shiro awake?\u201d Allura asked.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Keith answered. \u201cHe\u2019s coming down now.\u201d\n\u201cHere,\u201d Hunk passed Keith the bottle of formula he\u2019d prepared. \u201cMake sure he eats something.\u201d\nKeith fought down the  I don\u2019t know how to  building in his throat and instead took the bottle. He\u2019d watched Shiro do this enough, surely he could do it too. It didn\u2019t seem that hard. \u201cIt\u2019s cool enough for him to drink, right?\u201d\nHunk nodded. \nKeith adjusted his grip on the bottle. Lance was more awake now; he blinked owlishly at Pidge over Keith\u2019s shoulder, but he didn\u2019t stare like he stared at Keith. His attention was easily diverted to the bottle as Keith shifted him around. Keith\u2019s heart was still beating wildly as he carefully fed Lance the bottle. He didn\u2019t know why, but a strange, nervous excitement built in him at the thought of caring for Lance the way Shiro had been. \nShiro wandered in and took his seat when Lance was half down with his bottle. \u201cSorry about missing breakfast,\u201d he said as he rubbed the back of his neck, \u201cit was a long night.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Keith asked, dragging his away from Lance\u2019s peaceful face to look at Pidge. \u201cI thought it was your night.\u201d\nPidge bristled. \u201cI can\u2019t handle kids,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI panicked.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Pidge,\u201d Shiro said. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. I told you to come to me if you had trouble, and you did. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d\n\u201cThere is,\u201d Pidge muttered. \u201cNow you\u2019ve had two restless nights and I haven\u2019t done anything to help Lance. Even Keith is doing more than me.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d Keith protested.\n\u201cPidge, it really is alright,\u201d Shiro insisted. \u201cNot everyone can handle kids, and that\u2019s perfectly fine. It was a lot of responsibility for us to place on you. It\u2019s cool.\u201d\nPidge sighed. \u201cI\u2019m too used to working in the labs all night,\u201d he explained. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t fall asleep, and because I was awake, so was Lance. He got cranky and kept asking for Keith.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s eyebrows went up. \u201cHe did?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t look so happy over that, it\u2019s the only word he really knows.\u201d\nKeith scowled.  You\u2019re just upset he didn\u2019t ask for you,  he thought sourly. Some part of him that he didn\u2019t want to see was smug that he\u2019d been the recipient of Lance\u2019s attention.\n\u201cI want to run another scan on Lance today, if you are agreeable,\u201d Allura cut in. \u201cWe should be able to monitor the progress of his cells better now, and find out if he\u2019s healing.\u201d\n\u201cSounds good,\u201d Shiro agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been lucky to stay out of the range of the Galra these last few days, but I\u2019m concerned our luck won\u2019t last for much longer. It would be good if we could fit in some training\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut Lance, as he is, is proving to be problematic,\u201d Allura concluded. She gave Lance a contemplative look. \u201cPerhaps two of you can practice hand-to-hand combat while the other two pacify him?\u201d\n\u00a0\nOddly enough, Allura\u2019s plan worked. Shiro and Pidge paired up to train while Keith and Hunk watched over Lance. With the two of them there, Lance seemed rather content. He was easy to occupy when Keith wasn\u2019t on his own and didn\u2019t have Lance\u2019s unwavering attention focused solely on him. Allura returned to navigating the ship once she was sure everything was going smoothly, and Coran overwatched the training deck. \nLance was seated on the couch between Keith\u2019s legs, playing with one of the toys they\u2019d bought from the last planet. Every now and then he\u2019d abruptly stop and turn to stare at Keith real hard, like he was making sure he was still there. \n\u201cHe\u2019s pretty cute if you think about it,\u201d Hunk said. He was messing around with one of Pidge\u2019s laptops. It made a beeping noise every few minutes that surrounded suspiciously like a camera clicking. \u201cI though you said you weren\u2019t good with children.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m  not.\u201d \nHunk glanced at him, silent for a moment. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to spend time with him,\u201d he said. His voice was careful and gentle and somehow, Keith didn\u2019t feel upset by the comment like he thought he usually would have. \u201cI kinda feel the same, like I want him to like me like this, you know?\u201d\nKeith wanted to nod, but he didn\u2019t. He stared at the back of Lance\u2019s head instead.\n\u201cKids always seem to be the most honest with their feelings,\u201d Hunk continued. \u201cAnd if one likes you, it feels really good, like you\u2019re a good person. I know Lance \u2013 the normal Lance \u2013 does care for us all, but I sometimes wonder. He gets real homesick, like he wants to leave and never look back, and I know he wouldn\u2019t ever do that, but I feel bad for him.\u201d\nKeith hummed. He hadn\u2019t thought about it that way. Out of all the Paladins, Hunk was probably the best one to talk to. He was never judgmental and always honest, and he never had anything but their best intentions in mind. \n\u201cDo you miss the normal Lance?\u201d Hunk asked. \u201cBecause I do. It seems a lot quieter without him around.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t miss him-\u201d\nHunk gave him a look. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d\nKeith baulked and covered Lance\u2019s ears with his hands. \u201cOkay, I do, but you can\u2019t tell anyone! I swear, if this idiot gets any bigger of an ego he\u2019s not going to fit into his Lion.\u201d\nHunk laughed. \u201cAlright, alright, I won\u2019t tell. You know its okay to want to be friends with him, right? Like, that rivalry thing he has going with you is just his way of trying to make friends.\u201d\n \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t have a rivalry with you,\u201d Keith pointed out.\n\u201cYeah, but Pidge and me \u2013 we\u2019re different,\u201d Hunk explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been lumped together since school and our personalities aren\u2019t like yours. Lance likes to rile you up and make you react.\u201d\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\nHunk shrugged. \u201cI guess he just wants to be your friend,\u201d he said. \u201cLance is good at drawing people in, and he does a lot of it purposefully. I think he\u2019s scared of being lonely.\u201d\nHunk\u2019s words certainly gave Keith something to think about. He\u2019d been alone for a long time, but he didn\u2019t know if that meant the same thing as being lonely. He knew Lance was homesick, but he liked to cover it up, and Keith never mentioned it because he knew how vulnerable it made Lance feel. Like rooting through his memories, it was a line Keith knew to never cross. \n\u201cI wonder if Lance will remember any of this,\u201d Hunk mused. \nAt the sound of his name, Lance\u2019s head whipped up. He turned to give Keith that incredibly unnerving stare of his, flailing his little fists wildly. \u201cKeif,\u201d he said, reaching up a chubby little hand. \u201cKeif!\u201d\nKeith only stared. \u201cWhat do you want now?\u201d\nLance stared back at him.\n\u201cHe must find something about your face so interesting,\u201d Hunk laughed. He crossed the room and took the toy from Lance\u2019s hands to wiggle it in front of his face. \u201cWant to play, Lance?\u201d\nLance reached out both hands for the toy, making a small, surprised noise to find it out of his grip. \u201cKeif!\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m Hunk,\u201d Hunk said, pointing to himself. \u201cHunk.\u201d\n\u201cHun,\u201d Lance repeated. \n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Hunk grinned. He handed Lance the toy and stood. \u201cCoran should be making lunch by now, I\u2019m going to go check on him real quick. Who knows what he might try to feed Lance.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re going to leave me alone with him?\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Hunk said. \u201cLance likes you. Just don\u2019t panic.\u201d\nEasier said than done. Hunk was a calming, solid presence in the room and without him Keith floundered. Lance didn\u2019t seem to mind as much as Keith expected him to and instead turned to clamber across Keith\u2019s lap. He was talking to himself, making sounds and noises that weren\u2019t exactly words. Almost instinctively Keith nodded his head, just like he would if he were listening to a real conversation. \nMaybe he did miss Lance \u2013 the normal, talking, chatterbox one, however annoying he happened to be. It would explain why he wanted baby Lance\u2019s attention so much. Was he jealous when other people had it? Maybe that\u2019s why he felt so bitter. It made him feel weird to think it, but it was something to consider. Being better friends with Lance would help their teamwork, too. It wasn\u2019t like they still couldn\u2019t have a rivalry. \nKeith sighed. \u201cMaybe I just don\u2019t want to be alone, either\u2026\u201d He murmured to himself. He\u2019d been afraid of getting attached to the people here, and he tried to keep the idea of alone time as something to look forward to. And sure, while he still liked the idea of having his own company for a little while, he  did  enjoy spending time with his teammates. Could that be called a friendship? Lance called them friends often enough.\nSpeaking of Lance, he\u2019d gone back to doing his staring thing. He stood up on those wobbly legs of his, feet digging into Keith\u2019s thighs, and touched his little hands to Keith\u2019s face. It was such a weird thing for him to do that Keith didn\u2019t react. Eventually Lance\u2019s hands found his hair and, satisfied, he promptly relaxed against Keith\u2019s chest. He amused himself by pulling on the strands, but it didn\u2019t hurt.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so weird,\u201d Keith complained. \u201cEven as a baby, you\u2019re weird. What is up with you and your obsession with my hair?\u201d\nLance giggled. It was a pure, tiny bubbling sound that seemed to come straight out of nowhere, and Keith was so surprised by it that he became the one who was staring. \n\u201cWhy are you laughing at me?\u201d He demanded, frowning. Lance\u2019s eyebrows drew down into a frown too, and then he was giggling again, pulling on Keith\u2019s hair while he did. \n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten him to laugh!\u201d Allura exclaimed, surprised, as she entered the room with Shiro and Pidge. \u201cHow did you manage that?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything, I swear-\u201d Keith said, flustered. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing, Keith,\u201d Shiro chuckled. \u201cLaughter is better than crying.\u201d\nKeith didn\u2019t answer. It felt good that  he  was the one to get Lance to laugh first, the same way it was  his  name that Lance first said. It was another one of his embarrassing  I cradled you in my arms  moments, but he found that he didn\u2019t care too much. Lance wasn\u2019t really around to tease him about it, after all. \n\u00a0\nThey performed the scan on Lance before lunch. It seemed that his cells were repairing themselves well and Allura assured them that as long as Lance didn\u2019t become too stressed that he would return to normal soon. \nLunch was fairly uneventful. Shiro held Lance like usual and fed him spoonfuls of pureed fruit and vegetables that Hunk prepared. They listened to Pidge as he explained what he\u2019d been working on the previous night \u2013 an adjustment to the equipment used in their psychic training that would allow them to project memories onto a screen. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just in case Lance starts getting worked up and we can\u2019t calm him,\u201d Pidge explained. \u201cThat way we can use the new equipment to figure out what\u2019s bothering him.\u201d\nKeith still felt uncomfortable with the idea of seeing something Lance might not want them to see, but it would only be necessary in an emergency. They just had to make sure Lance never cried himself sick, that was all. In theory, it sounded easy enough. Lance hadn\u2019t ever really cried when Keith held him and Shiro had always been able to calm him down within moments, so they should be alright. Lance seemed to have settled down more now that a few days had passed.\nThat evening, before bed, they gathered in the common room. Allura hesitated before picking up Lance again, but Lance seemed used to her now and he only giggled as she poked at his stomach. \n\u201cHuman children are very endearing,\u201d she said as Lance grasped one of her fingers. \u201cHe seems very happy to be around people.\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s just Lance,\u201d Shiro said, amused. \u201cHe\u2019s like that normally.\u201d\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d Allura laughed. She smiled as Lance yawned widely and carefully slid him back into Shiro\u2019s arms. \u201cBut I do hope he returns to normal soon. As much as I don\u2019t miss his strange jokes, the castle is much quieter without him.\u201d\nEveryone nodded in agreement. Keith was oddly relieved to find out he wasn\u2019t the only one who missed Lance like that. \n\u201cHunk, are you alright with having him tonight?\u201d Shiro asked. \u201cIt\u2019s alright if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s alright,\u201d Hunk said. \u201cYou deserve a night\u2019s rest.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Shiro sighed. When Lance sleepily called out Keith\u2019s name again, Shiro stood. \u201cKeith, you hold onto him while I move the crib.\u201d\nKeith didn\u2019t argue. Even though holding Lance for a long time hurt his arms he found that the ache was oddly comforting. The only other time he\u2019d ever held Lance was when-\n\n Yeah, okay, not going back to that memory. No thanks. \n\nLance stared at him as Keith followed Hunk to Hunk\u2019s room. His eyelids were getting droopy but he stubbornly fought sleep as though he could actually win. Knowing Lance, he probably could, if he tried hard enough. \n\u201cIf you need anything, just come and get me, alright?\u201d Shiro said after pushing the crib into Hunk\u2019s room. \u201cHe should wake up once for a feed, but I think you know the drill. That schedule Allura made is really handy.\u201d\nHunk nodded. \u201cGot it.\u201d\nShiro placed his hand on Keith\u2019s shoulder on the way out. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll leave you to it. Goodnight.\u201d\n\u201cGoodnight,\u201d they repeated.\n\u201cYou can hold him for a little longer if you want,\u201d Hunk said once the door had automatically shut behind Shiro. He took a seat on his bed and let out a relieved sigh. \u201cCombat training with you is hard. I\u2019m picking Pidge next time.\u201d\nKeith absently rocked Lance in his arms. \u201cYou need to stop staring and go to sleep,\u201d Keith told him. Lance frowned but his eyes obediently drifted shut. Keith lowered him into the crib and fussed over the blankets for a moment before drawing away. \u201cI still don\u2019t know why he stares so much.\u201d\n\u201cLike I said yesterday,\u201d Hunk murmured, \u201cLance likes to copy you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHunk\u2019s easy going nature regarding Lance led Keith to falling asleep rather easily. Unlike the previous night, Keith didn\u2019t worry about Pidge\u2019s hesitance and instead found his mind occupied by Hunk\u2019s words. He really knew the right things to say, but Keith felt like they were pointless when aimed at him. He didn\u2019t know how to take them on board or how to act on them. It felt like a waste.\nRegardless, he found sleep easily enough. He probably would have slept throughout the night like he usually did if an alarm hadn\u2019t suddenly ripped through the castle only a few hours later.\nThey were under attack.\nKeith pulled on his suit and helmet as the alarm began to insistently ring through the castle. The lights in the hallway turned red as the main power generator switched to energy-saving mode. Keith was usually comforted by the colour but tonight it was nothing but background noise.\nAllura\u2019s voice crackled over the speaker in his helmet. \u201cGet to the hangers,\u201d she commanded. \u201cA Galra fleet is fast approaching us.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Lance?\u201d Hunk asked frantically. \u201cHe\u2019s started crying, I think he\u2019s scared.\u201d\n\u201cWell we can\u2019t take him with us,\u201d Keith snapped. He felt jumpy just as the  idea  of Lance being anywhere near the Galra like he was. That simply wasn\u2019t an option. It was way too dangerous. \n\u201cBring him to the observation deck, I\u2019ll have Coran secure him in the nursery,\u201d Allura said. \u201cWe might be able to put him in a static sleep for a few minutes. He won\u2019t like it, but he\u2019ll be safe. You will have to return as soon as possible.\u201d\nInducing sleep in a child didn\u2019t feel like the right thing to do, but Keith knew it would keep Lance from having a panic attack. Any time they could save by putting him in stasis would be a benefit to his health. Regardless, that wasn\u2019t currently something he could focus on when he had to get to his Lion. \nWhen the team was buckled in, Allura opened the hanger gates and they were ejected out into the open. Keith kept a tight hold on his controls as his eyes roamed the stretch of space before them. A Galra ship twice the size of Allura\u2019s castle loomed before them, steadily pressing closer and closer. Battle ships were being deployed from its ports even as the castle raised its particle barrier behind the Lions.\n\u201cEven though we can\u2019t form Voltron we\u2019ll still need to work as a team to take out the ship,\u201d Shiro told them. \u201cWe\u2019ll move in together and try to hold formation for as long as possible, got it?\u201d\nThey did as they were told and intercepted the battle ships before they could reach the castle\u2019s particle barrier. Keith tried to keep his fellow Lions in mind but it was hard when he himself was busy defending the castle. He propelled his Lion forwards, crashing through a line of ships that promptly burst into flames behind him. Debris clattered off the side of his lion but it was undamaged. As the smoke cleared, he spotted Hunk tackling a handful of ships that were shooting at the shield on Pidge\u2019s back. \nShiro\u2019s Lion was the largest and it could barrel through the enemy ships with more weight than the rest of theirs. It swooped down to crush the ships that took aim at Hunk while Hunk shielded Pidge and suddenly they were all grouped together again. \u201cKeep going!\u201d Shiro shouted through the communication lines.\nKeith urged his Lion forwards once more. Pidge took out the ships ahead of them and Keith took the chance to dive through the opening they created. He swerved down the side of the main Galra ship and released a burning jet of flames that scorched its surface. The machinery beneath its surface exploded at the rush of heat, smothering anything that happened to be chasing after him.\nOn the other side of the ship, Hunk took out one of the engines. His Lion\u2019s claws pierced the hull of the ship and tore away the protective metal sheeting, leaving it vulnerable. Keith watched him dive out of the way before the engine blew and then the yellow Lion was drifting beside him, its tail raised. \n\u201cUh, a little help here!\u201d Pidge shouted. The green Lion appeared out from under the ship followed by at least a dozen battle ships. The shield on its back was raised but it was clearly weakened and so Keith twisted his Lion down into a sharp nosedive. Another burst of flames engulfed the ships closest to Pidge before Keith had to turn them off and duck out of the way of the blasts himself.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the rest,\u201d Shiro called as he activated his blasters to speed across the back of the ship. An explosion followed him along the ship\u2019s edge, tearing through the metal and what lay beneath it. \u201cAllura, how are the castle\u2019s defence systems going?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re almost fully charged,\u201d Allura said. \u201cThirty more ticks.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, fall back to the particle barrier,\u201d Shiro ordered. \u201cI\u2019ll clean up behind us.\u201d\n\u201cThat felt surprisingly easy,\u201d Hunk muttered. \u201cWas it always that easy?\u201d\nKeith frowned, and glanced back at the Galra ship as Shiro fell into line beside them. Those ships were built for war and battle, and were equipped with a large number of weapons and drones. Why hadn\u2019t they been shot at by the main ship? Why hadn\u2019t its commander come out to fight them, or sent something bigger and meaner than a small fleet of beatable battle ships? It didn\u2019t make sense, unless\u2026\nUnless it was a distraction.\nA sudden explosion rippled through the particle barrier behind them. A shockwave washed over the castle and suddenly all its lights went out, the particle barrier included. Keith let out a shout as static burst in his helmet through the communication line. The power in his Lion flickered briefly but it did not turn off. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d He demanded. \n\u201cA wormhole appeared behind the ship!\u201d Allura\u2019s voice crackled through his helmets. \u201cThey\u2019re boarding the castle!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThat ship was just a distraction, we have to get back!\u201d Shiro shouted. \n\u201cHurry!\u201d Allura said. \u201cThey\u2019ve blocked the flow of energy from the main control room and cornered off the lower levels. I\u2019m doing everything I can to get the power back but it won\u2019t be long before they overrun the castle!\u201d\n\u201cThe lower levels?\u201d Keith repeated. \u201cThat\u2019s where the nursery is! Allura,  tell me  you have Lance with you still.\u201d\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sorry, Coran has him down in the incubator-\u201d\nA shock of anger rocked through Keith but it passed as quickly as it came. No one was at fault for endangering Lance right now except the Galra. \u201cWe have to go get him,\u201d Keith said. \u201cShiro, we have to go get Lance-\u201d\n\u201cCalm down, Keith,\u201d Shiro said evenly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to protect Lance and the ship, you hear me? You need to stay calm.\u201d\nKeith was calm, that was the problem, but he didn\u2019t say anything. He hadn\u2019t felt this riled up since they went to rescue Allura from Zarkon. Even then he hadn\u2019t felt the same swelling panic in his chest like he did now. He knew Allura could take care of herself, knew that she wasn\u2019t defenceless, but Lance was so vulnerable it was completely maddening. If Coran had gotten him into the incubator then it was very possible he was already in an induced sleep and he wouldn\u2019t even cry if someone took him.\n\u201cAllura, is there any way for you to open access to the lower levels?\u201d\n\u201cGive me a few ticks to get the power up again,\u201d Allura said. \u201cThe hangers are still open, you can get in through there.\u201d\nKeith directed his Lion back down to the hangers before Allura finished her sentence. He slipped in before the others without his usual carefulness and exited his Lion in a rush, making sure to take his bayard with him. Shiro jogged over to meet him with Pidge and Hunk in tow and together they forced the hanger bay doors open.\nThe lights flickered on to reveal an empty hallway. \u201cI\u2019ve turned the power on again,\u201d Allura informed them. \u201cThe lower level is still blocked off but that means the automatic door hasn\u2019t locked. You should be able to pry it open.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Shiro said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nThey followed Shiro down the hallway and into the lower levels of the castle. Like Allura had said, the automatic lock on the door wasn\u2019t in place and with the help of Hunk\u2019s bayard they were able to force it open. Galra soldiers greeted them on the other side but Hunk took them out with ease.\n\u201cThe particle barrier is raised again,\u201d Allura said. \u201cI\u2019ve taken care of the Galra ships, but the soldiers on our castle need to be disposed of before we can jump through a wormhole. We can\u2019t have them knowing our new location.\u201d\n\u201cCopy that,\u201d Shiro answered. \u201cThey\u2019ve obviously come here thinking we were all affected by the blast. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do to Lance if they get him, but I know it\u2019s nothing good. We have to go to the nursery and find him.\u201d\nKeith went ahead first this time. His heart was racing and his hands felt ridiculously sweaty as he gripped his bayard. Galra soldiers swarmed them whenever they turned a corner but with all four Paladins together they were never overpowered. \nWhen they reached the hall where the nursery was located, they found door blown wide open. Coran lay slumped against the floor, unconscious. Keith felt that anger surface in him again at the sight of his friend like that. When he reached Coran\u2019s side he bent down to feel for his pulse and let out a relieved sigh when he found it. \u201cHe\u2019s fine, just out cold,\u201d he told the other Paladins. \n\u201cPidge, you stay with him,\u201d Shiro said. \u201cHunk, Keith, we\u2019ll go to the nursery-\u201d\nA sudden, strained cry echoed out from the nursery. Keith\u2019s head whipped up as his breath seemed to leave his lungs.  That\u2019s Lance. Lance is crying. \nHe was standing in the doorway before he realised he\u2019d moved, staring at the scene that greeted him with wide, furious eyes. The nursery had been completely destroyed; the cribs they\u2019d fixed had been turned over and everything had been pulled from the shelves and uncaringly trodden on. There was a squad of Galra soldiers holding weapons standing around the incubator, which had been torn open. \nOne had its cold, metal hands reached into it to haul Lance up. \nKeith saw red. \u201cLet him go!\u201d He yelled, raising his blade. He lunged across the room and cut down the first soldier he reached, dragging his blade through its chest. They were the same robotic soldiers that he\u2019d seen time and time before and he held no compassion for them, not when they were hurting Lance.\nShiro rushed passed him straight for the soldier holding Lance. His hand made a glowing arch through the air as he attacked but Keith was too distracted to watch him. With Hunk and Shiro helping, it was easy to defeat the soldiers. They only managed to fire off a few shots that singed the walls of the nursery before they were nothing more than a crumpled pile of metal ready to be disposed of.\nWhen Keith turned around, Shiro was holding Lance. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look injured,\u201d Shiro said. He sounded out of breath. \u201cKeith, you take him. Try and get him to stop crying.\u201d\nKeith deactivated his bayard and immediately took Lance from Shiro. Lance felt heavier and more sluggish than usual, and Keith knew it must be because of the induced sleep. It mustn\u2019t have worked properly, but he was kind of grateful for that. At least Lance didn\u2019t have to suffer through the stress of an induce sleep, too. \nSuddenly exhausted, Keith slumped against the wall. He slid down until he was sitting and he could support his shaky arms on his knees. Lance was crying but Keith could hardly hear it, not with the rushing of blood in his ears. He was babbling something \u2013  you\u2019re gonna be alright Lance, don\u2019t worry, noting\u2019s gonna get you, I\u2019m here  \u2013 and he couldn\u2019t bring himself to stop. He didn\u2019t care if the others saw him; he held Lance close and didn\u2019t let go.\nHe\u2019d never been so scared to lose someone he cared about.\n\u00a0\nLance didn\u2019t stop crying for a long time after that. He wore himself out of the big wails eventually, but the sniffling and grizzling didn\u2019t stop for hours. He wouldn\u2019t eat lunch or dinner and if anyone so much as left the room he only got worse. Eventually he became so tired that he didn\u2019t notice when they started to carry on with their duties and instead only sat quietly.\nKeith couldn\u2019t blame him. The team had never really had anything to protect other than Voltron and each other, and even then they were all capable of defending themselves. They could fight, and think for themselves and find a way out. Lance couldn\u2019t. He was helpless and weak and could be seriously injured by things that didn\u2019t matter to them anymore, like cold weather or a fall or even alien food. If it hadn\u2019t been for him back when that blast had hit, they would all be like that.\nEventually it was Shiro who managed to quieten Lance. He held Lance in his arms as they sat on the couches after Allura had taken the castle somewhere safe. Coran had been healed and everyone was okay and it felt good to just  breathe  for a moment.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to repair the nursery tomorrow,\u201d Shiro said. He spoke quietly so that his voice wouldn\u2019t disrupt Lance who was currently on the losing side of a battle with exhaustion. \u201cHunk, Lance\u2019s crib is still in your room, right? Can you check to see if it damaged?\u201d\nHunk nodded, and stood. \u201cBe back in a minute.\u201d\nPidge wandered over to sit next to Shiro. He\u2019d been tinkering with the controls of the incubator and had managed to link them to a wireless scanner so that they could check on Lance\u2019s health. He let the scan run over Lance before handing the data screens to Allura who silently read them.\n\u201cHe does not seem physically injured,\u201d Allura finally said, \u201cbut the progress in his cells has rapidly decreased. He needs to regain his strength so that he can continue to heal. Do you think you can convince him to eat tonight, Shiro?\u201d\nShiro shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s way too tired. I\u2019ll have to feed him after he sleeps, I don\u2019t think he has the energy to do anything other than rest now. I can\u2019t imagine how frightened he would have been\u2026\u201d\nKeith winced. He\u2019d had the same thoughts roving around his head for hours after the attack. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of Lance, but he didn\u2019t really care. No one had said anything about it. Hunk had told him that it was alright for him to want to be Lance\u2019s friend, and if this was how he showed that he wanted that, then it didn\u2019t matter, did it? At least, he didn\u2019t think it did.\n\u201cKeith, are you still alright with having him tonight?\u201d Shiro asked. \u201cI don\u2019t mind taking him, if you want to rest.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Keith said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll take him.\u201d\nIt felt strange for him to want to spend time with Lance, but after tonight he was just too tired to argue with himself over it anymore. He felt much better when Shiro gently passed Lance into his arms and couldn\u2019t help but sigh at him. Lance\u2019s face was splotchy and red and his eyes were still watery but regardless of that he returned to his weird, persistent staring. It was comforting for him to do something so seemingly normal after all the mayhem of the day. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d Keith decided. \nShiro stood. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll go find Hunk and help him move the crib to your room.\u201d\nKeith nodded. He said goodnight to the others, who were all turning in for the night, before leaving the common room. He took Lance to his room while Shiro went to track down Hunk and rested Lance on his bed, being extra careful not to jostle him. He made sure Lance was distracted by Keith\u2019s blanket before changing into a loose shirt to sleep in. They\u2019d all squeezed in quick showers after securing the castle but Keith had been reluctant to give up his jacket and bayard. \nShiro arrived with the crib after Keith had changed and gathered Lance in his arms again. He set it up and adjusted the blankets before taking Lance from Keith and lowering him into it. \u201cYou know the drill,\u201d Shiro said. \u201cIf you have any trouble, just come find me. I don\u2019t know how much sleep either one of you are going to get tonight.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Keith said. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Shiro sighed. \u201cIf he does wake up for a feed, Hunk said he left a bottle of formula in the cupboard. You just need to add hot water and wait for it to cool.\u201d\n\u201cGot it.\u201d\nShiro reached into the crib and adjusted the blankets again. \u201cI hope Lance is alright,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019m worried this whole de-ageing ordeal is going to hurt him.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll probably be fine,\u201d Keith said, though he didn\u2019t sound very convinced.\nShiro only hummed and bid him goodnight before leaving. Keith waited a moment before carefully pulling the crib closer. When he laid in bed he could reach through the bars and keep his fingers resting against Lance\u2019s tiny hand. It was the only way he could convince himself to fall asleep.\n\u00a0\nFor the third night in a row, something unexpectedly woke Keith. He reached for Lance\u2019s crib without thinking. \u201cLance?\u201d\nHe was making quietly huffing noises that made Keith frown. He pulled Lance from the crib and wiped away the tears on his chubby cheeks. Did Lance usually cry by himself at night? Somehow, just thinking that Lance was shouldering that ache by himself made Keith upset. Before Lance had been de-aged, he\u2019d never stopped to consider that Lance might be more than just homesick. None of them deserved to be sad like that.\nGently, he set Lance down against his chest and laid back against his pillows. Lance gripped a fistful of Keith\u2019s shirt and continued to sniffle, even when Keith rested a hand on his back like he\u2019d seen Shiro do. \n\u201cIt\u2019ll be alright,\u201d he told Lance. \u201cTomorrow will be better.\u201d\nUnbidden, his mind strayed back to Pidge\u2019s modifications on the psychic equipment. They could use it to see which memories bothered Lance the most. If they did, then they could help him. Would it be so bad to know how he felt when he was alone? Maybe it wasn\u2019t his place to know, Keith thought. If Lance wanted to tell them he was lonely then he would, wouldn\u2019t he? He seemed the type. It wasn\u2019t like he had exactly hidden his homesickness. \n\u201cMaybe it would be better if we saw what was going on in that empty head of yours,\u201d Keith mused. \u201cThough you might kill us for it. What do you think?\u201d\nPredictably, Lance didn\u2019t reply. He probably didn\u2019t understand what Keith was really saying, though he seemed comforted by the sound of Keith\u2019s voice. His grip on Keith\u2019s shirt slowly loosened, and his sniffles began to die down. He lifted his eyes once to peer up at Keith before closing them again, content.\nKeith sighed and lowered himself down onto the bed properly. He carefully pulled the blankets up over them and rested his nose in Lance\u2019s hair. It was surprisingly soft and not as unpleasant as he might have once thought it to be. He wondered what Lance would think if he knew what Keith was thinking about him when he was stuck in this form.\nSleep was easier to find after that.\nKeith overslept. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he hadn\u2019t woken up at the crack of dawn, and even without the light of the sun to wake him his internal clock had still worked. That morning, however, it seemed to go on strike and he only woke when someone entered his room.\n\u201cRise and shine, Keith,\u201d Hunk said as the door slid open. \u201cYou still sleeping?\u201d\nKeith mumbled out an answer and lifted his free arm to cover his eyes. \u201cDid I miss breakfast?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Hunk said. He straightened Lance\u2019s crib and moved it out of the way. \u201cI take it he didn\u2019t wake up for a feed during the night?\u201d\nKeith shook his head. \u201cWoke up and he was crying to himself. I don\u2019t think he slept much until I took him out of the crib.\u201d\nHunk took a seat on the edge of Keith\u2019s bed. \u201cIs he awake?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Keith shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s still sleeping.\u201d\n\u201cWant me to take him to the dining room?\u201d\nKeith hesitated. A part of him still felt possessive over Lance\u2019s attention, but it wasn\u2019t like Hunk would do anything to him, so he nodded. He had to get dressed anyway. \u201cYeah.\u201d\nHunk stood again. When he reached for Lance, he began to stir. As he was lifted from Keith he suddenly let out a shattering cry that shocked Keith right into wakefulness. He\u2019d reached up to snatch Lance back into his hold before thinking about it and held him close as Lance grabbed tight fistfuls of his shirt again. \n\u201cWell that settles that,\u201d Hunk sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s really attached to you.\u201d\n\u201cIs he?\u201d Keith asked, surprised.\n\u201cYou\u2019re as oblivious as him sometimes,\u201d Hunk snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll go make the bottle, you just bring him down to the dining hall. Sound good?\u201d\nKeith nodded. He waited until Hunk had left the room before turning his attention to Lance, who was steadily making a wet spot on Keith\u2019s shirt with his tears. Although he\u2019d be embarrassed about it later he couldn\u2019t help but rock Lance in his arms and press his nose into Lance\u2019s silky hair again. At least it seemed to comfort him \u2013 Keith, too, if he were being honest. \nEventually Lance settled and his cries became nothing more than soft whimpers. Keith set him down on his bed and changed as quickly as he could before Lance started crying again. It was awkward to change with Lance staring at him but he didn\u2019t think it could be helped. He shook it off and got it done and then picked Lance back up, breathing out a sigh of relief when another crying fit was avoided.\n\u201cYou gotta calm down, Lance,\u201d Keith said, voice quiet and soothing. \u201cNothing\u2019s going to happen again, I promise.\u201d\nLance huffed against Keith\u2019s collarbones and let out a watery, miserable, \u201cKeif.\u201d\nIt hurt Keith\u2019s heart. He really did miss the usual Lance, and although it was a thought that made him sigh in resignation, it was an honest one. \u201cI\u2019m here, buddy,\u201d he finally said. \u201cLet\u2019s go get you something to eat, alright?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNo one mentioned Lance\u2019s strange attachment to Keith over breakfast. Lance wouldn\u2019t eat for a while but after Keith had finished his meal he diverted his attention to making sure Lance had at least half the bottle. It took a lot of patient prodding before he finally convinced Lance to cooperate. He was just as stubborn as ever, it seemed.\n\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Keith asked as Hunk took away the half-finished bottle. \n\u201cClean up the nursery, for a start,\u201d Shiro sighed. \u201cThen finish repairing the ship and get back to training.\u201d\n\u201cI want to perform another scan on Lance later today, too,\u201d Allura said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about his progress after all this stress.\u201d\nKeith nodded. He was absently stroking his fingers through Lance\u2019s hair as he mulled over his thoughts. Lance had settled more after eating but he still seemed upset. \u201cMaybe we should use the psychic headgear Pidge modified,\u201d he suggested.\nShiro frowned. \u201cIt seems invasive,\u201d he pointed out.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Keith said, \u201cbut I have thought about it for a while, and I think it\u2019s a good option. Limiting how much stress he\u2019s under will help him return to normal faster, right? Wouldn\u2019t seeing his memories help us do that?\u201d\n\u201cHe has a point,\u201d Pidge said as he turned to face Shiro. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it would hurt Lance, and if it helped us figure out what he\u2019s feeling and how to avoid stressing him out any further\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not an option,\u201d Shiro relented, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want Lance to be upset when he returns to normal. Allura, what do you think?\u201d\nAllura hummed to herself for a moment. \u201cI admit, I do not know Lance as well as some of you,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it does not seem like he\u2019s retained any of his normal thoughts as he is now. I cannot say for sure whether he will remember any of this, but regardless, we must help him as best as we can. If that means using Pidge\u2019s invention, then so be it.\u201d\nThey took the day to think it over. In the meantime, the Paladins set to cleaning up the nursery again. Lance would cry if Keith put him down so he couldn\u2019t do much, but he didn\u2019t leave his fellow Paladins to do it alone. He held Lance in one arm and helped as much as he could, but eventually his arms became too sore to do much more than support Lance. \n\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll remember any of this?\u201d Hunk asked just before they took a break for lunch. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s going to be super embarrassed if he does.\u201d\nKeith flushed. He would be embarrassed too, but that didn\u2019t discourage him from holding Lance. If anything, he only held him tighter, absently rocking from side to side. It still felt good to have Lance\u2019s weight in his arms even if it was tiring to hold him for so long. At least he wasn\u2019t crying anymore. \n\u201cHe might,\u201d Shiro said, \u201cor he might not. It doesn\u2019t really matter as long as he\u2019s alright.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLance ate lunch, thankfully, and then Allura scanned him again. It seemed that his cells were beginning to regenerate at a faster pace again, which was good. Allura assured them that he would be back to normal within the next few days. It was comforting to hear, no doubt, but it did bring up strange feelings in Keith that he hadn\u2019t expected to feel.\nDid he want Lance back to normal? He knew he did, but the thought of losing this Lance saddened him. He felt like he\u2019d made a real connection with Lance like this, that for once someone needed him as much as he needed them and was willing to show it, and if Lance went back to normal then Keith would lose that. He didn\u2019t want to lose it. Who\u2019s to say the normal Lance would ever want anything to do with him again outside of Voltron when he found out about how much Keith had hoarded his attention?\nHe didn\u2019t want to think about it.\nAfter lunch, they finally decided to look through Lance\u2019s memories. It was a group decision, one they only came to after everyone agreed to it. If Lance became angry over their actions, then the blame would be placed on all of them. It was fair that way.\nThey did it on the training deck like they had last time. Pidge adjusted the headset to fit Lance\u2019s tiny head, and with Lance sitting in Keith\u2019s lap he turned the equipment on. Lance let out a worried noise but he quietened when Keith instinctively offered him his hand to latch onto.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Pidge murmured. \u201cIt should project whatever Lance is remembering through the holographic receptor on the headset.\u201d\nAs Pidge had said, a screen began to flicker forth from the headset. Lance\u2019s attention was drawn to it and he let out a curious noise as an image of the training deck appeared. \n\u201cHe\u2019s thinking of the training deck?\u201d Hunk asked, puzzled.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s what his current thoughts are on,\u201d Pidge said. \u201cWhen we did this exercise before we consciously thought of things that were dear to us and used that to transform the image into our lions. We need to prompt Lance into remembering the moment he was upset so that we can find the source of it.\u201d\nKeith frowned, his grip automatically tightening around Lance. He didn\u2019t like the sound of it. He didn\u2019t want Lance to be that upset again. \u201cIs that necessary?\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, yes,\u201d Pidge said. \u201cLance isn\u2019t old enough to follow commands or directions, especially not regarding things like emotions or memories. The question is, how do we prompt that in him again?\u201d\nShiro glanced at Keith. \u201cYou won\u2019t like it, but you might have to let him go,\u201d he said. \u201cHe gets upset when he\u2019s put down, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\nKeith cringed, and pulled Lance closer. \u201cWhy?\u201d He asked defensively.\nShiro sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t like it either,\u201d he said gently, \u201cbut it\u2019s the easiest way. It\u2019ll only be for a little while, Keith.\u201d\nKeith bit the inside of his cheek, frowning. He knew what Shiro was saying was the truth and that he was just being\u2026  protective,  but that didn\u2019t make him feel any better about it. Rationally, he knew that Shiro was the most protective of them all and that he\u2019d never put them in danger, so he slowly began to loosen his grip on Lance. \nWhen he sat Lance on the floor and they all stood to stand back, Lance\u2019s eyes started to turn watery. \u201cKeif,\u201d he whimpered, reaching out with a chubby hand. The image from the headset changed to one of Keith wearing his suit and helmet. It was strange seeing himself from Lance\u2019s point of view \u2013 he didn\u2019t look as tall as he thought he was, and his face didn\u2019t have its usual grouchy expression. Why did Lance think of him looking so\u2026 soft? \nThe longer they stayed away from him, the more upset Lance got. He started to whimper and his face scrunched up and he tried to stand, but couldn\u2019t. Keith moved to go to him, feeling his heart start to race, but Shiro held him back with a cautious hand to his shoulder. \n\u201cKeif,\u201d Lance whimpered again. He reached out a hand and let out a small cry when Keith didn\u2019t go to him. \u201cKeif, Idge, Hun\u2026\u201d\nKeith winced, and shared a glance with his fellow Paladins. They looked just as distraught as he felt. Even if Lance didn\u2019t really know what he was saying, the way he said their names pulled at a deep, hidden part of Keith that he desperately wanted to respond to.\nThe image from the headset abruptly changed as Lance got more upset. At first it was the Paladins standing together, their lions in the background, but it quickly expanded to include Allura and Coran, too. Keith watched it with sharp eyes, trying to discern any meaning from it. Even as he watched the image began to shift and their figures fell away into nothingness. \n\u201cHe dreams of losing us,\u201d Allura whispered. \u201cHe fears it.\u201d\nWhat replaced the image of them was an image of Lance\u2019s family. It was like the one Keith had seen before when they first used this technology. Keith had never seen such a big family \u2013 Lance had many brothers and sisters, some older and some younger, as did his parents. Keith could only assume that all the people who filled the projection were his uncles and aunts and grandparents. He probably had nieces and nephews by now, too, and looking at them-\nKeith could suddenly understand why Lance felt so homesick. If all the people in Lance\u2019s family had the same, cloying air to them that Lance did when he was a child like this, how could anyone ever stand to be away from them? Lance had grown up surrounded by all those people and all that warmth and now he was stuck in space fighting aliens. It hurt Keith just to think about it.\nThe images that Lance brought forth began to change. There were moments when his mother appeared \u2013 cooking with her back to Lance, holding a bouquet of flowers, waving a wooden spoon at a handful of her children, even tightly hugging Lance despite the mud and dirt caked on Lance\u2019s cheeks. Other images of his siblings appeared \u2013 they caught beetles together and made sandcastles and blew out candles on birthday cakes. \nMixed in with those images were the images of the Paladins. There was Pidge on the roof of the garrison listening for alien chatter and Hunk eating the food Lance would nab from the kitchen for him and even Keith across the classroom from when he still attended. Unsurprisingly there were no images of Shiro but that did not mean he was absent from Lance\u2019s memories; he was there in news articles and online posts that Lance searched for. They were all there, parts of Lance\u2019s small world, and they remained there even as that small world expanded to encompass the entire universe.\nIf those were the only memories Keith had to deal with, then he thought he would be alright. He could cure Lance\u2019s homesickness; they all could. Affection and comfort and steady reassurances would be enough to placate Lance as he was. They could be enough.\nBut Lance had other memories. He would curl up in his bed for hours trying to find sleep and fail. He could lose his grip on his Lion\u2019s controls for a second because his hands were too shaky. He would look at the alien food they were served and even though he appreciated it he couldn\u2019t help but miss his father\u2019s cooking and the cutlery from his house and even the plates and their chipped paint.\nLance was  lonely.  Bone-deep, achingly lonely and none of them had done enough to fix him. He was always there for them, lightening the mood with jokes and making them laugh. They\u2019d mistaken his energy for contentment. \n\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Keith finally snapped. He took several large strides to reach Lance and pulled the headset from him. Lance was crying still, reaching up for Keith with a desperation Keith had never seen him display before. He heaved Lance up into his arms and held him tightly even as Lance slobbered all over his neck. \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d he repeated, quieter this time.\nThey now knew what made Lance upset, and so they had to fix it.\n\u00a0\nLance refused dinner that evening. He napped after Keith took him from the training deck and woke up grouchy and tireder than before. Keith made sure that no one put him down if they held him, but eventually it became easiest just for Keith to have him all day. He didn\u2019t mind holding Lance, even if Lance cried or drooled. Shiro was still the one to change him \u2013 for Lance\u2019s sake, it was better if only one of them saw him exposed like that \u2013 but Keith found that he was more than capable of doing the rest of it himself. \nEventually he convinced Lance to eat a few spoonfuls of pureed vegetables. He grumbled and scowled the entire time, but he still ate it. \u201cThere you go,\u201d Keith said, \u201cyou finally finished the whole bowl.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to scan him one last time before we retire to bed,\u201d Allura said after she had finished her meal. \u201cI\u2019ll go fetch the wireless scanner now.\u201d\nKeith nodded and absently wiped Lance\u2019s mouth clean with a napkin. \u201cHe ate enough today, right Shiro? He won\u2019t get sick or anything?\u201d\n\u201cI believe so,\u201d Shiro said. He was leaning against the table, silently watching over everyone as they slowly wound down from dinner. \u201cHe\u2019s settled down now, but I think you should make sure he eats at least once during the night.\u201d\nKeith nodded again. \u201cAlright.\u201d\nAllura scanned Lance once more before everyone went to bed. Keith moved into the common room where he could lounge around on the couches, Lance tucked away in his arms under a blanket. He would have thought Lance would have fallen asleep by now, but he didn\u2019t. He watched Keith with those big blue eyes of his like he was trying to tell him something, but he didn\u2019t speak anything past quiet whines and nonsensical murmurs.\nKeith could do nothing but sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can understand me, but I am. It was partially my idea to root around in your head, and it\u2019s partially my fault that we never realised what you were going through. We suck as a team, don\u2019t we?\u201d He laughed humourlessly. \u201cWe\u2019ll get better, I\u2019m sure of it, Lance.\u201d\nSometimes Keith forgot that he\u2019d never been around children before. It felt so easy to care for Lance, so natural that he could forget about his insecurities and his hesitance with little problem. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be like this around all children, or if it was because it was  Lance.  Somehow, he thought it was the latter. Lance was different, and he always had been. It had just taken this for Keith to realise it.\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t really have a family like you do,\u201d Keith said quietly. \u201cIn your memories, there were so many people, Lance. I don\u2019t know how you remember all of their names. You grew up surrounded by energy and clutter and noise and I just can\u2019t comprehend it. It\u2019s no wonder you get lonely without a lot of people around, without socialisation. I think we all do, in varying degrees, but you\u2019re the type of person to suffer without it.\u201d\nHe paused for a moment to run his fingers through Lance\u2019s hair. He felt unexpectedly small in Keith\u2019s arms tonight even though he hadn\u2019t physically shrunk at all. Only when Lance made a small, inquisitive noise did he continue talking.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not that type of person,\u201d he confessed. \u201cI like to be alone; I thrive on it, in fact. I work better in silence and solitude and it\u2019s like I know loneliness better than I know any of you. It\u2019s not like I want that sort of life, it\u2019s just been all I had, but it\u2019s different now.\u201d\nLance reached up a hand to touch Keith\u2019s cheek. It was an affectionate, unexpected gesture that brought a strange sense of warmth to him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s different now,\u201d he repeated, \u201cbecause you guys are always around. I don\u2019t always like it and we don\u2019t always get along, but I don\u2019t want to go back to the way it was before. One day this whole Voltron thing is going to end and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do and I\u2019m scared.\u201d\nIt was more than he\u2019d ever admitted to before, even to himself. Somehow, he felt better for it. Telling Lance those things about himself made him feel better.\nHe hoped he could still do the same for Lance when Lance returned to normal.\nThe next day, Lance was surprisingly\u2026 okay. He woke once during the night for a feed, which Keith gave him. It hadn\u2019t taken as long as he\u2019d thought it would have; he leaned against the counter in the kitchen, yawning, and gave Lance his bottle, then walked around the castle until Lance drifted back to sleep.\nIn the morning he woke Keith with needy cries that stopped the moment Keith\u2019s eyes opened. Lance was more observant than usual as Keith carried him to the dining room, and he curiosity held onto a fistful of Keith\u2019s hair like he\u2019d never seen it before. \u201cAgain with the hair,\u201d Keith had said, though he hadn\u2019t made a move to untangle Lance\u2019s fingers. \u201cWhat is with you and my hair?\u201d\n\u201cHe seems better this morning,\u201d Shiro remarked. He smiled when Lance gave him an observant look and took him from Keith with practiced ease. Keith only let him go because he wanted to make up Lance\u2019s bottle again. Hunk had explained to him how to do it and Keith had made sure to listen well. He knew exactly how much formula was needed and how much water the bottle required to be appropriately filled. \nShiro handed Lance back to Keith when he returned with the bottle. Lance was very interested in eating and did so with a hand wrapped in the ends of Keith\u2019s hair again. \nWhile he ate, Allura performed another scan. \u201cHe seems much better now,\u201d she informed them with a satisfied smile. \u201cWhat did you do, Keith? Lance is far calmer today than I expected.\u201d\nKeith flushed. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d He said.  I only told him what I\u2019m afraid of.  \u201cLance is just being weird again.\u201d\nAllura laughed quietly. \u201cWell, this change certainly does seem to fit his personality,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m glad he is feeling better now. It should not be much longer before he returns to normal, if all goes well.\u201d\nShiro nodded, pleased. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. He turned to face the Paladins. \u201cWhat do you want to do today? We could try training again but I don\u2019t know how well we\u2019ll be able to do it.\u201d\n\u201cI for one want to work in the labs some more,\u201d Pidge said. \u201cI\u2019m working on some modifications for my lion. I want to see if I can extend the amount of time it goes invisible.\u201d\nShiro nodded. \u201cSounds good. What about you, Hunk?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably help Pidge out,\u201d he said with a shrug. Keith sometimes forgot how good Hunk was with machinery \u2013 he was smarter than he looked. \u201cAt least until lunchtime anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you, Keith?\u201d\nKeith hesitated. Usually when they had free time like this he always went to the training deck. He didn\u2019t like lounging around like Lance did and if he wasn\u2019t being productive then he was irritated and full of too much energy. Today, however, felt different. Why would he give up time with Lance to go to the training deck? He surprised himself by thinking it, but accepted it for what it was. He was doing a lot of that lately. \n\u201cWill you watch over Lance?\u201d Shiro asked as he noticed Keith\u2019s indecision. \u201cHe seems to like you the best. It might be good for you to relax a little, too.\u201d\nKeith nodded. It was easier when the decision was taken out of his hands. \u201cAlright.\u201d\nWhen breakfast had finished and everyone had disappeared into the depths of the castle to do their own thing, Keith took Lance into the common room. A few of Lane\u2019s toys were on the floor from a few days ago so Keith set them down beside Lance on the couch. Lance seemed more than happy to play around with him while Keith simply watched over him. \n\u201cKeif,\u201d Lance said, holding up one of the toys expectantly. \u201cPlay.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s eyebrows went up. He didn\u2019t know Lance could say other words, and he didn\u2019t think any of the Paladins did, either. He smiled a little when he realised it was a secret only he shared with Lance and took the toy from him. \u201cAlright,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll play.\u201d\nLance giggled. He probably didn\u2019t have a clue what Keith was saying but Keith guessed it was all in his tone of voice. Keith thought that Lance probably would have been happy with anything he said as long as he said it nicely.  Maybe that\u2019d work on the normal Lance, too? It was a funny thought. \n\u201cHere, hold that one like this,\u201d Keith said. He turned the toy in Lance\u2019s hands the right way around. The toy made a jingling sound as the bell in it rattled and Keith couldn\u2019t help but laugh quietly as Lance\u2019s eyes went wide in surprise. \u201cIt makes a noise if you shake it,\u201d Keith told him. He gripped Lance\u2019s tiny hand in his to help him shake the toy.\nHe was rewarded with a sharp, refreshing burst of laughter. Lance made this happy, huffing sort of noise and flailed his arms but he didn\u2019t dislodge Keith\u2019s hand. \u201cKeif play,\u201d he repeated, grinning broadly.\nHis smile was infectious. \u201cKeith,\u201d he corrected gently. \u201cCan you say it properly, Lance? Kei-th.\u201d\nA contemplative furrow appeared in Lance\u2019s brow as he stared at Keith. \u201cKeif,\u201d he repeated.\n\u201cKeith,\u201d Keith said.\n\u201cKeith,\u201d Lance repeated. \u201cKeith!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Keith exclaimed. A grin tugged at his lips and he helplessly let it encompass his face. \u201cYou did it, Lance!\u201d\nLance screeched with laughter, his toy rattling again. \u201cKeith!\u201d\nKeith couldn\u2019t help but laugh too. Being around a child like Lance made him feel focused and invigorated; he had a set goal laid out before him and he knew how to achieve it. Sure, there were many things he was still hesitant about, but he wasn\u2019t frightened of them. He thought that if Lance started to cry again he would be able to handle it without Shiro\u2019s help. \n\u201cWhat about Pidge?\u201d Keith asked. \u201cSay  Pidge,  Lance.\u201d\n\u201cIdge.\u201d\nKeith laughed again. \u201cNo, Pidge. Pi-dge.\u201d\n\u201cPid- Pidge,\u201d Lance repeated, frowning.\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right! What about Hunk? Can you say Hunk, Lance?\u201d\n\u201cHunk!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not so bad at this,\u201d Keith said.\nLance just giggled. He was thriving on the positive attention. \n\u201cNow say Shiro,\u201d Keith said.  \u201cShiro.\u201d \nLance frowned at the wording. Shiro\u2019s name was the only Paladin name he hadn\u2019t said before \u2013 Keith thought it might have been because of the pronunciation. Lance had trouble with the  th  sound that was in Keith\u2019s name, so it was reasonable to think that the  sh  sound in Shiro\u2019s name would cause him to have similar problems. \n\u201cShi-ro,\u201d Keith said slowly.\n\u201cRo,\u201d Lance repeated, his voice shaky. \u201cSi- Siro.\u201d\n\u201cAlmost,\u201d Keith encouraged. \u201cShiro.\u201d\nLance frowned again, though perhaps it was more of a pout than anything. \u201cSiro,\u201d he repeated, before finally squeezing out, \u201cShiro.\u201d\nKeith grinned again, pulling Lance into his arms to hug him tightly even as Lance giggled. \u201cGood job, Lance! They\u2019re gonna be so surprised at lunchtime, just you wait.\u201d\nEventually Lance grew bored of his toys and learning words, so Keith decided to take him around the castle. He held both of Lance\u2019s hands in his and helped him take slow, wobbly steps down the hallway. Lance was babbling things that didn\u2019t exactly made sense sprinkled with words that did, often including Keith\u2019s name or even one of the other Paladins.\n\u201cI think you can walk on your own,\u201d Keith said. He crouched down beside Lance and held his hands to steady him. \u201cThough you\u2019re really floppy still.\u201d\nLance just babbled at him, looking between his own feet and Keith like he couldn\u2019t decide where to stare. \nKeith inched back a bit so that his arms were stretched out, but did not let go of Lance\u2019s hands. \u201cCome on, now,\u201d Keith said, \u201cI know you can walk.\u201d\nLance struggled for a moment, whining, as his fingers tightened around Keith\u2019s. He took a step forwards and stumbled, but Keith held him upright. Lance was never the type to give up, not even now, and at Keith\u2019s gentle insistence he tried again. This time, knowing that Keith could catch him if he happened to fall, Lance began to walk.\nThat strange, prideful feeling saturated Keith again. It hadn\u2019t been Shiro or Hunk or Allura that helped Lance like this, that knew these new things about Lance first \u2013 it was him. Out of all the people Lance had chosen to favour, he\u2019d picked Keith. Maybe it was luck or coincidence or just Lance copying the way Keith had watched him, but that didn\u2019t matter at all. \nKeith didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever had a bond like this before. He didn\u2019t think it was just because Lance was a child, either. Even before that they\u2019d been something that wasn\u2019t quite friends and wasn\u2019t quite true rivals, but it wasn\u2019t anything more, either. Lance always maintained they were rivals, but that was mostly on his half \u2013 a one-sided thing. Keith didn\u2019t think of Lance as a rival until Lance provoked him into some stupid competition, and he was always stupid enough to rise to the bait. \nThis situation had made Keith realise a lot of things. He didn\u2019t know what to label his relationship with Lance, and didn\u2019t know how to label what he wanted his relationship with Lance to be, but somehow that was alright. Maybe Lance would know. Maybe he\u2019d want the same thing, whatever it was. It seemed like something that the normal Lance would know in that random, spontaneous way of his.\nAt lunch, after they\u2019d all eaten, Keith wanted to show off Lance\u2019s new skills. Lance had been babbling from the moment they entered the dining room but none of it was anything truly coherent, so the surprise hadn\u2019t been revealed. After pushing away Lance\u2019s empty bowl, Keith pointed at each of the Paladins and asked Lance what their names were. Like clockwork, Lance repeated their names almost perfectly. He recognise Hunk and Pidge easily enough and paused for a moment at Shiro before confidentially declaring his name, too. Although he still stumbled over Shiro\u2019s name like he had before he didn\u2019t seem to notice, so Keith didn\u2019t mind. He was just glad Lance hadn\u2019t forgotten anything they\u2019d done earlier that morning.\n\u201cYou taught him so much,\u201d Allura said, surprised. \u201cHuman children learn at a remarkably fast rate, don\u2019t they?\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s just Lance,\u201d Shiro chuckled. \u201cHe likes to be right.\u201d\n\u201cHe can walk, too!\u201d Keith said. \u201cHe was doing it before, all on his own. Well, sort of.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Allura asked.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Keith nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d\nHe set Lance down on the floor and shifted a few paces back before holding out his arms. Lance wobbled for a moment like before, gripping the leg of the chair beside him to keep himself balanced. \u201cKeith,\u201d he said, holding out a hand.\n\u201cCome here,\u201d Keith said, gesturing for Lance to come closer. \nLance hesitated for a moment, gauging the distance between Keith and the chair, before slowly letting go of his support. He took one step and almost stumbled again, but then he took another, and another, and he didn\u2019t stumble anymore. A triumphant look came to his face as he pushed himself straight into Keith\u2019s arms. \u201cKeith!\u201d \n\u201cSee? I told you he could walk!\u201d Keith said as he scooped Lance up into his arms to stand again. \u201cDid you see?\u201d\nShiro laughed. \u201cWe saw,\u201d he agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s great, Keith. He must really like you, huh?\u201d\nKeith flushed and didn\u2019t answer. He didn\u2019t deny it, either. He hoped Lance liked him, even if it was just this Lance and not the normal one. It was a step in the right direction, wasn\u2019t it? A baby step. Literally. \n\u201cHe should be back to normal sometime tomorrow, right?\u201d Shiro asked. \u201cIt hardly seems like it\u2019s been a week with everything that has happened.\u201d\nAllura nodded. \u201cYes, I must agree with you there. The scans are indicating that the blast from that Galra monster has almost worked its way out of him.\u201d\n\u201cIs he suddenly going to just puff back into the normal Lance?\u201d Hunk asked, concerned. \u201cBecause that seems a little out there, even for alien magic. Also, that seems like it would be painful. Is it going to be painful?\u201d\nKeith\u2019s arms tightened around Lance at the mention of pain. He didn\u2019t want Lance to be hurt. He hadn\u2019t even thought about how Lance would return to normal; none of them had seen him change size the first time and so they had no idea how it would happen now.\n\u201cI think it would be best to put him in the healing pod,\u201d Allura said. \u201cI do not think he will just\u2026  puff  back into his normal size as you said, Hunk, but his growth rate will suddenly increase when the time comes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what does that mean, exactly?\u201d Shiro asked. \u201cWill he be in pain?\u201d\n\u201cPossibly,\u201d Allura said. \u201cAs much as I do not wish for Lance to be hurt, it certainly seems like a progress that may cause him some form of pain. It won\u2019t only be his cells that become incredibly active \u2013 his bones will have to grow again, as will his organs and his skin and his brain.\u201d\n\u201cWill putting him in the healing pod help?\u201d \nCoran nodded as he listened to the conversation. \u201cThe healing pods are designed to induce a coma-like state in those who use them, as you are well aware,\u201d he said. \u201cIn such a state it is unlikely that Lance will feel pain as he won\u2019t be awake for any of it. Essentially, he will be numb to it all.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when he wakes up?\u201d Keith asked. \u201cWhat then? That sort of pain doesn\u2019t seem like the type to just disappear, healing pod or not.\u201d\n\u201cI imagine he will be very exhausted,\u201d Allura said. \u201cDehydrated and hungry, too. If he is in pain we can extend his stay in the healing pod until his body completely recovers and then wake him. I\u2019ve never come across this sort of illness before so I cannot say for sure what will happen, but we must be prepared for all outcomes.\u201d\nShiro made a noise of agreement. \u201cWe\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it,\u201d he decided. \u201cFor now, Lance seems perfectly fine. He didn\u2019t start crying at all did he, Keith?\u201d\nKeith shook his head. \u201cNot even once.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good sign,\u201d Shiro said. \u201cHe would cry if we left the room before, so it seems that he\u2019s settled now. If we can keep him calm until it\u2019s time for him to go into the healing pod he might be in less pain.\u201d\n\u201cHow will we know when it\u2019s time?\u201d Keith asked. He absently held Lance a little tighter and tried to fight away the thoughts in his head that said he was losing Lance. He wasn\u2019t losing him at all; he was getting him back. He hoped that by the time Lance had returned to normal that he\u2019d remember that.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it will become clear to us,\u201d Allura said. She turned to Coran. \u201cHow long do you think the process will take? The blast that turned him into this form was almost instantaneous, was it not? It couldn\u2019t have been more than a handful of ticks before the other Paladins reached him.\u201d\nCoran frowned thoughtfully. \u201cWell I image re-aging will take much longer than de-aging,\u201d he said. \u201cThe healing pod will alert us when he\u2019s ready to return to consciousness again so we\u2019ll have to wait until then. It could be a few hours, or even a few days. There\u2019s no way of knowing until he\u2019s in there.\u201d\nKeith scowled. That wasn\u2019t reassuring at all. What if Lance was in there for weeks and the Galra attacked again? They barely managed to get away last time, and even then the Galra were almost successful in kidnapping Lance. What would happen if the Galra sent more than one fleet? What if they sent a dozen? A hundred? More? They couldn\u2019t do anything without Lance there to form Voltron. For once, Keith felt utterly helpless. He couldn\u2019t help Lance heal and there was no way he could speed up the healing pod even if he desperately wanted to. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out,\u201d Shiro reassured. He glanced at Keith as if he could read Keith\u2019s thoughts and gave him a sympathetic look. Keith wasn\u2019t upset by it. \u201cIt\u2019s useless for us to worry about it when we have at least another day to go before it becomes a real problem. For now let\u2019s focus on what we can actually do, alright? And that\u2019s make sure Lance is safe and secure and that he isn\u2019t stressed.\u201d\nKeith nodded. He could do that. That was definitely something he could do. \n\u201cJust keep Lance occupied like you have,\u201d Shiro said, placing a comforting hand on Keith\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re doing well.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKeith did as he was told. He liked spending time with Lance and the time between lunch and dinner passed with ease. He taught Lance to say  Allura  and  Coran  \u2013 he called Coran \u201ccorn\u201d for the first few tries and it took a while for Keith to stop laughing after that. Lance wasn\u2019t doing too well with \u2018L\u2019 sounds and he kept saying \u201cArura\u201d but he was cute enough to let it slide.\nIt was worth all the trouble to see Allura\u2019s face light up when Lance yelled \u201cArura!\u201d from across the hallway when they entered the dining room. \nLance ate dinner well and soon started to drift to sleep in Keith\u2019s arms. It was Shiro\u2019s night again and although he offered to let Keith take him, Keith shook his head. \n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I want to,\u201d Keith had told Shiro as they moved the crib to Shiro\u2019s room, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s best that he spends time with others, too. We\u2026 We still don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to remember and I don\u2019t want him to hate me. Besides, if he does like me best then he likes you second best.\u201d\nShiro rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. \u201cYou think?\u201d\nPerhaps Keith wasn\u2019t the only one who enjoyed Lance\u2019s attention. Children really were quite amorous and forthcoming with their affection, and to gain it certainly gave a person a good feeling. Not even Shiro was immune to that.\nKeith still reluctantly said goodnight to Lance as he tucked him into his crib. \u201cI can take him if he starts to cry\u2026\u201d He offered weakly.\nShiro put his hand on Keith\u2019s shoulder again. \u201cI know,\u201d he said, smiling gently. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Keith, he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\nKeith scowled again. \u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019m going now.\u201d He cast one cast glance at Lance before sighing. \u201cNight, Shiro.\u201d\n\u201cGoodnight, Keith.\u201d\n\u201cKeith,\u201d Lance whined sleepily. Keith tensed at the sound of his name but didn\u2019t turn around. \nHe\u2019d see Lance in the morning.\nWhen Keith made it to the dining hall the next morning, many of the others were already awake and present. Allura had taken her seat at the head of the table, though Coran wasn\u2019t around \u2013 he was probably in the kitchens. Hunk and Pidge hadn\u2019t yet arrived but Shiro was seated across from Allura with Lance in his lap. It didn\u2019t look like breakfast had been served yet so he was banging around with a rattling toy that Shiro had probably given him.\n\u201cGood morning, Keith,\u201d Shiro said as he spotted Keith enter the room. \n \u201cKeith!\u201d  Lance cried out, reaching out his little hands to grab for Keith, giggling. \u201cKeith, Keith!\u201d\nA small smile came to Keith\u2019s face, unbidden. \u201cAlright, hold your horses,\u201d he said as he heaved Lance up into his arms. Lance instantly reached out to hold fistfuls of Keith\u2019s hair, grinning like mad. \u201cWhy\u2019s he so hyperactive this morning?\u201d\nShiro laughed quietly. \u201cHe\u2019s only just become like that,\u201d he said. \u201cLance is just excited to see you, Keith. He\u2019s been waiting for you to arrive since he woke up.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s eyebrows went up. \u201cHas he?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nThat feeling of pride came back to Keith again and he turned his gaze away from Shiro and Allura to hide it. It felt good to be the one who finally shared a connection with someone else like this. He\u2019d never had it before, not like he had it now, and it made him feel good. Even better than that was the fact that Lance reciprocated it, too. Sure he was just a child, but that didn\u2019t matter to Keith. A connection was a connection and that was that.\n\u201cWe should keep a close eye on him today,\u201d Allura said. \u201cIt\u2019s been seven days since he was hit with that blast, so the effects of it should have almost finished running their course.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll watch him,\u201d Keith said. He was always watching Lance, it seemed. He did little else, especially after Lance had been hit with that blast. \u201cWhat are the plans for today, Shiro?\u201d\n\u201cSame as yesterday,\u201d Shiro said. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to get worked up or tired in case something happens to Lance. We should all be ready for when he needs us.\u201d\nKeith nodded. That sounded like a reasonable plan to him. There was no way for them to predict what would happen to Lance but it was simple to know that he would need them when he woke up. Even if he didn\u2019t remember what had happened, his body would go through enough to exhaust him, just like Allura had said.\nHunk and Coran entered the dining room with breakfast soon after that. Pidge appeared when they did. Breakfast was much was it always was; a peaceful, social event. Now that they could work as a team well enough not to need to sling food around, everyone left the table with full stomachs. Keith used one arm to hold the bottle Hunk made for Lance while he used the other to eat his own breakfast. It was a little fiddly but he worked it out alright. \n\u201cI\u2019ll be opening a wormhole to transport the ship to a safer location later today,\u201d Allura informed them. \u201cCoran located a small, isolated pocket where there are no colonised planets or Galra bases anywhere close by. We should be able to station ourselves there safely for quite some time.\u201d\nShiro nodded. \u201cAlright, sounds good,\u201d he said. \u201cCome find us if anything changes in Lance, alright Keith?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t need to be told to do that but took it for what it was. Everyone dispersed from breakfast with a sort of reluctant languidness, and Keith didn\u2019t blame them. He supposed he was lucky that he was the one who got to hold Lance all day \u2013 they were just as worried as him. The others, especially Pidge and Hunk, had known Lance for a lot longer than he had. More intimately, too. They\u2019d been in the same team back at the garrison after all. Maybe it was a little selfish of Keith to want Lance\u2019s attention all to himself so badly, but even knowing that he still couldn\u2019t give it up. \nHe spent much of the morning lounging around in the common room with Lance again. Although his mind told him he shouldn\u2019t be wasting time outside of the training deck, the other parts of him were more than comfortable resting on his side against the couches as Lance entertained himself with his toys. \nAbsently, Keith fixed Lance\u2019s sweater. Every time Lance flailed his arms or turned around to stare at Keith as he often did, his clothes would become twisted or ride up. Shiro had put him in a red sweater with a collar today, paired with black pants and matching black socks. \u201cYou look just like a Red Paladin today,\u201d Keith told him, poking Lance in the arm once. \u201cSee? Our clothes match.\u201d\nLance just giggled, shaking his rattling toy again as if to agree with Keith.\nKeith allowed himself a small smile. He poked Lance in the stomach and enjoyed the giggle he got in return. Maybe Lance was ticklish, and as Keith skittered his fingers along Lance\u2019s chubby side, Lance positively screeched with laughter.  So you are ticklish, then. \n\u201cKeif, no!\u201d Lance said, huffing around his giggles. \u201cKeif!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Keith,\u201d Keith said, a grin pulling at his lips as he pulled more laughs from Lance. Was the normal Lance ticklish? For a moment he thought he could just poke his fingers into Lance\u2019s side to see if he was, but then he shook his head.  I can\u2019t do that! Why did I think I could do that?  \n\n I bet he is ticklish, though. \n\nSighing, Keith finally relented. He rested his chin in his hand, the other loosely resting on his side, as he watched Lance. Lance\u2019s giggles died down into breathless little noises as he stared at Keith. It wasn\u2019t as off putting as it had been before. Keith guessed he was used to it.\n\u201cKeith,\u201d Lance corrected himself. He wiggled closer and leaned over Keith\u2019s head, resting back against the top of Keith\u2019s chest as he did. \nKeith lifted his free hand to wrap around Lance\u2019s waist just in case he toppled over; he\u2019d rather not have Lance fall on his face. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Keith asked. \nLance just babbled at him. It was the same, mindless chatter as before but it was oddly pleasing to listen to. He didn\u2019t have a clue what Lance was saying but he didn\u2019t think it was too important. He nodded and hummed as much as he would have if it were a two-sided conversation. \nEventually, Lance\u2019s chatter seemed to quieten. Keith gave him a frown as Lance sat down on the couch in front of him to rest himself up against Keith\u2019s chest. \u201cYou sleepy, Lance?\u201d He asked quietly, reaching up to run his fingers through Lance\u2019s soft hair. Lance didn\u2019t usually fall asleep at this time of day, and he certainly shouldn\u2019t be sleepy after eating breakfast. That knowledge made Keith\u2019s chest tighten.\nLance was beginning to re-age.\nKeith knew he should tell Shiro and the others, if just to inform them that Lance was starting to behave different, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to. He wanted to keep Lance to himself for a little while longer. \u201cYou can sleep for a bit if you want,\u201d he told Lance, \u201cbut you gotta wake up later, alright? Deal?\u201d\nLance nuzzled his nose against Keith\u2019s collarbones and promptly fell asleep, fingers tangled in Keith\u2019s hair. Keith sighed at him. Of course Lance would still be as frustrating as always, though he didn\u2019t feel the same irritation that he used to. Perhaps he just felt resignation. He didn\u2019t want to give this Lance up, not just yet. Part of him was afraid that Lance wouldn\u2019t remember this bond and part of him was afraid that he would. They couldn\u2019t guarantee that Lance would wake up himself, either \u2013 with everything that had happened to him it was possible that he wouldn\u2019t ever be his normal self again.\nAnd even though Keith and the normal Lance hadn\u2019t always gotten along well, Keith didn\u2019t want him to disappear forever. If possible, he would have liked to get to know that Lance the same way he knew this Lance. Would it be possible for them to replicate the bond he had now? Would Lance even want that?\nThinking about it hurt Keith\u2019s head. He liked spending time with Lance like this \u2013 was that bad of him? He\u2019d become accustomed to Lance\u2019s attentions and it had only been a week. He was annoyed at himself for letting that attachment grow, but when he glanced down at Lance\u2019s sleeping face pressed against his chest, the irritation dissipated. Running his fingers through Lance\u2019s hair calmed him and after exhaling once, he was able to put those thoughts behind him. They would do him no good now. Instead, he focused on enjoying Lance\u2019s company, even if he was sleeping. \nAgain, Keith sighed. He closed his eyes, just for a moment, hoping to enjoy Lance\u2019s closeness for a little while longer. Before he knew it, he was sleeping, too.\n\u00a0\nWhen he woke, Shiro was leaning over him. \u201cWake up, Keith,\u201d he murmured quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve missed lunch.\u201d\nKeith let out a groan as he sat up. Lance was still curled up against his chest and Keith slipped an arm under him to keep him in place. \u201cDid I? Sorry.\u201d\nShiro shook his head. \u201cNothing to apologise for. You seem tired.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep,\u201d Keith said. \u201cLance did and I was laying down and I just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Shiro repeated. He took a seat beside Keith and gave Lance a searching look. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t usually sleep at this time of the day.\u201d\nKeith winced. \u201cI know. I think he\u2019s starting to re-age now,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI just wanted to let him sleep for a while.\u201d\n\u201cKeith, you know you can talk to me if you feel worried,\u201d Shiro said gently. \u201cI may be able to help.\u201d\nHe glanced away. Shiro didn\u2019t sound pitying; if it was any other person with perhaps the exception of Hunk, Keith would have been offended. But this was Shiro, and Keith knew that Shiro would do anything to protect them. He was just like that. \u201cI am worried,\u201d Keith said slowly, \u201cbut I just\u2026 I like this Lance,\u201d he said. \u201cI want the other one back too, of course, but. I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t know how to say it. The words were getting stuck in his throat and it was endlessly frustrating. He just didn\u2019t want Lance to be alone anymore, and if in doing so he gained some sort of bond with Lance, then even better. \n\u201cKeith, there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting a connection with Lance,\u201d Shiro said, placing a hand on Lance\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIf he could get past his whole rivalry mindset, I\u2019m sure you two would be unstoppable. You have a connection with him that the rest of us don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Keith said, turning his head to look at Shiro. \u201cI don\u2019t have any connection with him, not like I do now.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to lose that,\u201d Shiro concluded, sighing. He paused for a moment to gather his thoughts. \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure what\u2019s going to happen, but I know Lance will appreciate you being there for him. You never know, he might remember everything.\u201d\nKeith flushed. \u201cThat might be even worse than if he forgets,\u201d he said, miserable.\nShiro laughed. \u201cWhatever the outcome, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine. We all will. I\u2019ll make sure of it, okay?\u201d\nWhen Shiro said it, Keith felt inclined to believe him. He nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLance was grouchy at lunch. He almost fell asleep face-first into his bowl of pureed mush and after a while of struggling to get him to eat Keith just gave up. Lance would start to get teary-eyed if Keith put him down, but it wasn\u2019t the same kind of teary-eyed as before. This time it was more desperate, more frightened. Keith knew it was because of the blast.\nAs the day progressed Lance started to fidget and whine. His fingers would periodically tighten in Keith\u2019s hair to the point of pain before he\u2019d let out a whimper and go still. He was in pain and there was nothing Keith could do about it other than hold him and comfort him as best as he could. He rubbed Lance\u2019s back and smoothed down his hair and shushed him when his whimpers became loud.\nTowards the end of the evening, after she had relocated the ship to a safe space, Allura did another scan on Lance. This one took longer than the previous ones and the screens that appeared to show his diagnostics were longer and full of more information. Keith didn\u2019t understand much of it but he didn\u2019t really need to \u2013 Allura did.\nShe frowned as she read it over. \u201cHis progress has definitely accelerated,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s causing him pain as his nerves begin to stimulate augmented growth. I would not want to leave him out of the healing pod for much longer, but the longer we wait so that the blast properties can fully disintegrate, the better. When the pain becomes too uncomfortable for him he will have to go in.\u201d\nKeith nodded and continued to rock Lance quietly. He was in the middle of another uncomfortable bout of pain but as Keith rocked him, he slowly relaxed. \u201cKeif,\u201d he whined miserably, huffing wet puffs of air into the crook of Keith\u2019s neck. Keith didn\u2019t bother correcting his pronunciation anymore.\n\u201cHow much longer?\u201d Shiro asked. His arms were crossed and there was tension in his shoulders but his voice was still nothing more than gentle and concerned. \n\u201cA few hours, at best,\u201d Allura said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t risk much more than that.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t seem like all that long to Keith. He wouldn\u2019t hand Lance over to anyone who came to see him, but he did let them hold onto Lance\u2019s hands and smooth down his hair. If they did lose Lance, then it wouldn\u2019t only be Keith who suffered. As if sensing their concern, Lance would reach out to pet the faces of the other Paladins and babble their names at them. He was weak and tired but he still tried to cheer them up and it made Keith\u2019s heart hurt.\nNo one ate dinner that night. They all sat in the common room spread out across the lounges, talking quietly. No one made a comment when Lance let out pained whimpers and cries of their names. Perhaps Keith shouldn\u2019t have taught him them, after all.\nIt was nearing the time they usually retired to bed when Lance\u2019s discomfort became too much. He started to cry \u2013 at first, they were only small, staggered cries, but they became big, heart-shattering wails within moments. No matter how much Keith comforted him, he wouldn\u2019t stop.\nKeith had never been so helpless. There was nothing he could do and no way for him to ease Lance\u2019s pain, no matter how hard he tried.\nThey moved him into the healing pod shortly after. Shiro folded one of his jackets around Lance as they set him on the floor. When Lance had first been transformed his clothes had not shrunk with him and it was unwise not to believe the same problem wouldn\u2019t occur. Shiro\u2019s jacket would be long enough to cover Lance\u2019s modesty with ease when he turned back to normal.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be alright,\u201d Keith whispered to Lance as he gently set him down. \n\u201cKeif,\u201d Lance whined, reaching out of him.\nKeith closed his eyes tightly as he cautiously untangled Lance\u2019s fingers from his hair. \u201cYou\u2019ll be alright,\u201d he repeated. Lance just stared at him, eyes wet and cheeks red. Keith hesitated, glancing over his shoulder to make sure no one was watching him before carefully bending down to press a chaste kiss to Lance\u2019s forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll be here when you wake up, okay?\u201d\nAllura turned the pod on after Keith had moved away. Keith couldn\u2019t bear to watch it freeze over so he didn\u2019t, turning his face away. His arms felt oddly empty and light without Lance\u2019s weight in them. He\u2019d gotten used to carrying him around and having his warmth pressed against his chest and the quiet sound of his breathing. What was he meant to do with himself, now? \n\u201cThe pod will tell us if something happens, right?\u201d He asked Allura.\nShe nodded. \u201cYes, it will,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve programmed it to give me hourly updates so that if anything happens we\u2019ll know straight away.\u201d\nKeith was tempted to ask her to program it to give him updates as well but he held his tongue. He would drive himself crazy if he had that. It was better if he didn\u2019t no matter how much he hated the feeling of having to wait in the dark.\n\u201cI think it would be best if we got some rest,\u201d Shiro finally said after they spent a moment standing in silence. \u201cIf no one wants to eat, then go to bed. It will do us no good if we\u2019re tired in the morning, so don\u2019t go wandering, either.\u201d\nKeith nodded. Not even Hunk seemed to have an appetite so after a round of quiet goodnights they each disappeared into their rooms. Keith sat on his bed after he\u2019d gotten changed, wondering what to do with himself. He didn\u2019t feel tired. He kept staring at one of Lance\u2019s blankets \u2013 it was thrown onto his desk from where it had probably fallen out of the crib a few nights ago. Shiro had probably forgotten to take it with him.\nHe could hear Shiro moving the crib now. He was probably taking it back to the infirmary. Keith was tempted to see if he wanted help, but stopped himself. They were all dealing with the anxiousness of Lance\u2019s situation and Shiro probably wanted to be alone for a bit. Keith didn\u2019t want to disturb him. Instead, he tried to rest, but even with the lights turned off and his blankets pulled over him he found himself too restless to sleep.\nEventually he started to wonder if it would be better for him to watch over Lance for a little while longer. Maybe if he stayed up for a while he would become tired enough to sleep for a few hours. He was only putting himself on edge with those kinds of thoughts so with a scowl he kicked off his sheets and made his way back to the healing pods. \nIt had been at least an hour or two but Lance hadn\u2019t changed. Keith stood in front of the pod, arms crossed, and watched him with a frown on his face. There were hardly any signs that Lance was alive \u2013 his skin was pale and his eyes were still. If not for the steady, albeit subtle rise of his little shoulders Keith would be far more concerned. \nHe sighed.  What am I doing?  He knew he should go back to bed and try to sleep, but his feet wouldn\u2019t cooperate. He wanted to stay with Lance. Even pressing his forehead against the glass of the healing pod didn\u2019t do much to alleviate his concern.\nAt least standing there did ultimately tire him out. \u201cI hope you wake up soon,\u201d he whispered to Lance. \u201cI don\u2019t like it when the ship is so quiet. Everyone misses you, you know. I\u2026 I do, too, so wake up soon, okay?\u201d\nLance couldn\u2019t hear him but it still made him flustered and embarrassed to say such things. After sparing Lance one more longing look, Keith turned away. He just wanted Lance back, no more pain or loneliness or quiet suffering. Lance needed better \u2013 deserve better.\nHe\u2019d make sure those things never came back to haunt them.\nLance didn\u2019t wake up the next day, or the next. Keith was wearing holes into the ground as he paced before the doors into the healing pod room. After the first day Allura had gone in to check on him and come out wearing a wince.\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d Keith had demanded.\nAllura had only shaken her head. \u201cThis process looks very uncomfortable,\u201d she had murmured. \u201cI think it is best that you do not see him until he has completely grown.\u201d\nHer comments made grotesque images flood Keith\u2019s mind. Lance wasn\u2019t awake for any of it but that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t make expressions, not to mention the scans would display his heart rate and his brain activity. He couldn\u2019t help but think something was going wrong \u2013 were his bones growing at different rates? Where his limbs awkwardly proportioned? Was he in pain?\nAs if she could read his mind, Allura had pulled him aside later that evening. \u201cIt is not as bad as you think,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he is in pain. He has many years to regrow and its straining his body.\u201d\n\u201cBut what\u2019s happening to him? What does he look like?\u201d Keith had asked her, gripping her shoulders tight without really meaning to. \nAllura had only hesitated a moment before sighing. \u201cHe\u2019s uncomfortable, and bruised.\u201d\n\n \u201cBruised?\u201d \n\nAllura nodded. \u201cHis joints in particular \u2013 elbows, knees, wrists \u2013 are bruising significantly. I half expect his skin to split in some places, but I don\u2019t think it will. He\u2019s taken good care of it.\u201d\nKeith had wanted to laugh at that. A dry, humourless laugh. He could picture Lance in his head, skin practically glowing. His skin care routine was probably longer than everyone else\u2019s, and he was going to be so smug when he realised how important it had come to be.\nAfter that, no one had been allowed into the healing pod room. Not even Pidge could crack the code, though Keith didn\u2019t think he tried as much as he could have. Allura was protecting them from seeing their friend in pain when they couldn\u2019t help and that was something to respect. It didn\u2019t, however, stop Keith from pacing in front of the door like a frantic mother. (He wouldn\u2019t have ever called himself that, but Hunk had and now everyone was doing the same. Keith just scowled at them until they stopped. He was  just worried, okay, I\u2019m just worried so shut up!) \nHe kept thinking that there must be something they could do, but there simply wasn\u2019t. He\u2019d known that this process might take longer than a day, but it was driving him mad. He couldn\u2019t sleep for longer than a few hours at a time and he trained until he was sweating through his suit just to try and burn off some of his restless energy. The entire castle was suspended in a tense, tightrope situation and Keith was afraid that if he crumbled, or if anyone crumbled, then they would all fall. \nIt was hard to be happy without Lance. Without any of them, he was sure, but Lance was different. They needed him.  I need him. \nAnd not just for Voltron.\n\u201cCome on, Keith,\u201d Shiro said from the end of the hallway, \u201clet\u2019s eat. Glaring at the door won\u2019t help.\u201d\nHe knew it wouldn\u2019t and having that pointed out to him was irritating, but he didn\u2019t say anything. He wasn\u2019t mad at Shiro and snapping at him would only make everything worse. Shiro was just trying to help.\nAlthough he wasn\u2019t hungry, he did follow Shiro to the dining hall. Hunk was distracting himself by making food and there was so much that Keith didn\u2019t think they\u2019d ever finish it, but that didn\u2019t matter. They could use it as leftovers. If Keith happened to notice that much of the food made was Lance\u2019s favourite, then he didn\u2019t mention it. No one did.\nHe managed to make himself eat that night. Rationally, he knew the food must taste good, but he could hardly get himself to swallow more than a handful of mouthfuls. He felt incredibly mindful of his actions, like the others were watching him, waiting to catch him when he broke down, and although he felt closer to them after this whole incident, that was going a little too far. He didn\u2019t want them to think he was weak, that he needed coddling. \nSo he ate. That way Hunk wouldn\u2019t worry over him, and if Hunk didn\u2019t worry over him, then Pidge wouldn\u2019t. He ate and he looked like he was managing to control himself, because that way Shiro was satisfied, too. Keith didn\u2019t think he could trick Shiro properly, but Shiro knew when to hold his tongue, and Keith was grateful for that. He didn\u2019t think he could track Allura either, but she was easier to avoid than Shiro.\nThat evening, Keith got a few hours of sleep before waking again. It had been happening ever since they\u2019d put Lance in the healing pod, but usually if he walked around for a while he\u2019d become tired enough to sleep again. That was what he did again that night \u2013 walk around. It was a little colder in the hallways than he expected but his skin was still warmed from sleep so it didn\u2019t bother him too much. \nSomehow, he found himself walking back towards the healing pods. Allura had kept the room locked up tight since the first time she checked on Lance, and every time Keith had walked past it or gone to glare at it, it had been shut. Tonight, however, was different. As he rounded the corner he spotted a wedge of light spilling across the floor. His body jerked at the sight of it and he was struck with the urge to peer in, but he held himself back and swallowed heavily.\nHe did walk closer, but he didn\u2019t enter the room. \u201cAllura, are you in there?\u201d\n\u201cKeith? Yes, I\u2019m here.\u201d\nKeith bit his lip and leaned against the wall. \u201cHow\u2026 How is he?\u201d\nAllura was silent for a moment and it worried him. Then, she spoke. \u201cYou may come in.\u201d\nHe hesitated, but then shook his head. He didn\u2019t have anything to be afraid of; he couldn\u2019t be the type of person to become frightened over something like this. It just wasn\u2019t  him.  \nOnly Allura was in the room when he entered. She was standing before Lance\u2019s pod, staring at it with a small frown on her face. \u201cHis growth is going well, before you ask\u201d she said as Keith slowly came to stand beside her. \u201cCan you not find sleep?\u201d\nKeith shook his head. His eyes were intensely focused on Lance \u2013 he was much bigger now, and the change suddenly felt so abrupt that Keith could hardly comprehend it. Gone was the baby he\u2019d left in the healing pod, replaced with a bigger, early-teenaged Lance who lay slumped against the back wall. Like they\u2019d predicted his old clothes hadn\u2019t fit; they lay in tatters across his thighs. Thankfully, Shiro\u2019s jacket had stayed slumped around shoulders, covering everything that needed to be covered.\nIt wasn\u2019t Lance\u2019s clothes that Keith found himself stuck on, however. It was the bruises.\nLike Allura had said, they were mainly on the joints of his body. His elbows, knees and wrists were splattered with dark blue stains that were clearly visible even with his dark skin. Not only that, but they were scattered across his shoulders and ribs where his bones were expanding and growing faster than the rest of him. For a moment, Keith had a fleeting thought that puberty must have been a strange time for Lance where he spent years awkwardly growing into his features, but the thought was quickly dashed away with by unhappy feelings. \n\u201cIs he in pain?\u201d Keith asked. His voice sounded oddly calm, even to his own ears.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Allura answered. \nKeith appreciated her no-nonsense attitude. With a deep inhale that seemed to make his lungs shudder, he dragged his gaze away. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything we can do, is there?\u201d\nAllura winced. She looked more upset that Keith had seen her in a while. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t sleep that night, or the one after. He trained until his arms shook and he ate until he felt full but it didn\u2019t help. Allura had told him the password into the healing pod room in case he wanted to go check on Lance, but he never did. Before, his feet had carried him there without him meaning for them to, but now he avoided it at all costs. He would walk around the entire castle as long as it meant he didn\u2019t need to pass through that hallway.\nThe others noticed, but he didn\u2019t let them say anything about it. He knew they must know he\u2019d seen Lance, but he wasn\u2019t willing to talk about it, so he didn\u2019t. \nThe next night he went to the observation deck. He wasn\u2019t sleepy, but he was tired. When he stood before the great, domed window that gave him a look out into the galaxy, he felt a little better. Seeing such a big, endless space before him made him feel like he was floating, like all his thoughts could drip out of his ears like running water and be forgotten forever. Sometimes, when he looked out at the universe, he missed earth. Other times he only wanted to get further and further away. \nShiro came to find him after a few hours. Keith was drowsy, but not enough to sleep, so he didn\u2019t mind the company. He knew Shiro would come to talk to him eventually, and as Shiro took a seat on the floor beside him, he was kind of glad to have someone else around.\n\u201cYou feeling alright?\u201d Shiro asked. \n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Keith said, though he wasn\u2019t. He just didn\u2019t know what he felt. \u201cLance isn\u2019t.\u201d\nShiro pursed his lips. He turned his head to watch the stars like Keith was. \u201cHe\u2019s growing, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good, at least.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you going to do when he wakes up?\u201d Shiro asked. Keith half expected him to ask more about Lance, or about how Keith was feeling. Funnily enough, the change in conversation topic was rather relieving. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Keith answered. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to remember.\u201d\nShiro hummed. \u201cI know this is hard for you,\u201d he said, \u201cand I want you to know that the rest of us are going to be there for you just as much as we\u2019ll be there for Lance. You don\u2019t need to be afraid of anything you want from him, Keith.\u201d\nKeith glanced at him, eyebrows furrowed into a worried frown. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I want,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can I tell him when I don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d Shiro paused, \u201cMaybe show him, instead? I don\u2019t think you give him enough credit. If you show him, he\u2019ll know.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s heart was lodged in his throat. When had it gotten there? He couldn\u2019t remember, but it was racing like crazy. \u201cWhat if I still don\u2019t know?\u201d\nShiro gave him a small, comforting smile. \u201cI have a feeling it\u2019ll come naturally to you. Most things do, Keith, even if you don\u2019t notice. Take it one day at a time, okay? Just one day.\u201d\nHe nodded once, then nodded again. One day at a time. He could do that.\n\u00a0\nFive days after being placed in the healing pod, Lance showed signs of consciousness. Allura\u2019s alert went off as they mulled over breakfast. It was only a short, quiet beeping noise but it still buried its fingers into Keith\u2019s brain to make a permanent space for itself.\nAs a group they went to the healing pods. It reminded Keith of when Lance had been in a coma and he\u2019d impatiently wanted to get Lance out. Even back then he\u2019d wanted Lance\u2019s attention, it seemed. He\u2019d just never realised.\n\u201cAlright, let's get you out of there,\u201d Coran said as he fiddled with the controls for the healing pod. After a moment the front screen lowered and puffs of cooling air wafted out. Lance had completely returned to his normal age but his joints and his face was still littered with bruises. Keith guessed that his facial features had been the last of him to settle after puberty. No one mentioned that Lance was all but naked. \nFor a moment, nothing happened. Then, Lance\u2019s eyes peeled open and he let out a pained whine. Without any strength in him he stumbled straight out of the pod and Keith leapt forward to catch him, grabbing him under the arms in an attempt to keep him upright. \u201cLance!\u201d\nLance was panting against Keith\u2019s neck. His brows were pinched and his limbs were shaking uncontrollably. From where Keith\u2019s hands pressed against his sides his skin felt dangerously cold.\nHe was still in pain and it was so evident that Keith like the air had been punched from his lungs.\n\u201cWe need to get him back in the pod,\u201d Allura commanded, moving forwards to help Keith lift Lance. He almost wanted to yank him away from her but she was right \u2013 Lance needed to go back in the pod until he finished healing.\nLance cried out in pain when they wrestled into back into the healing pod. As Keith was drawing back Lance\u2019s fingers suddenly found a fistful of his hair. \u201cKeith,\u201d he whimpered.\nKeith jerked back as if stung, his grip on Lance\u2019s waist going limp. Allura muscled Lance into the healing pod and then the front screen was sliding upwards and frost was creeping up along Lance\u2019s skin. Knees suddenly weak, Keith toppled backwards, landing heavily on his hands. He couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\u201cKeith? Keith! Get up,\u201d Shiro said, but his voice sounded distant, as though he wasn\u2019t standing right behind him. Even when Shiro pulled him to his feet Keith hardly realised it. \nLance\u2019s words were as deeply ingrained in his mind as Allura\u2019s beeping alert had been. He\u2019d only said one thing, but his tone and the frightened look on his face were burned behind Keith\u2019s eyes and no matter how many times he blinked they wouldn\u2019t go away. Lance had only said one thing, just one, but it had been enough to render Keith completely useless.\nLance had grabbed his hair.  Lance grabbed my hair. He grabbed it just like he did when he was a baby. \nDid he remember?\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s in shock,\u201d Shiro murmured to Allura, \u201cor something.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him like this,\u201d she whispered back.\n\u201cNeither have I.\u201d\n\u201cShould I\u2026 embrace him? Feed him? How do humans offer comfort?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually different for everyone\u2026 Probably don\u2019t hug him.\u201d\n\u201cI can hear you,\u201d Keith said, scowling. \u201cYou\u2019re not being very quiet.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, Keith,\u201d Shiro said. \nIt wasn\u2019t Shiro\u2019s fault, and like before, Keith wasn\u2019t angry at him. He didn\u2019t know who he was angry at, or if he was angry at all. He felt cold on the inside, and his mind was fuzzy. He tried to distract himself or convince himself to go do training simulations again, but he couldn\u2019t move. He was just  tired. \n\u201cNow that he\u2019s awake he shouldn\u2019t be in the healing pod for much longer,\u201d Allura said. \u201cHis vitals are all improving and the bruises are starting to disappear. He will be alright.\u201d\n\u201cHow long until he wakes up?\u201d Hunk asked. \u201cCoran and I have to cook enough food for him again.\u201d\nNo one mentioned that he\u2019d never stopped doing so.\n\u201cA day, perhaps? I\u2019ve upped the pain medication levels to help.\u201d\nPidge cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on something this week to modify our lions,\u201d he said. \u201cI took the battle record from the Blue Lion and separated the code it recorded from the moment the blast hit. I think I\u2019ve made something that will prevent anything like that from happening again \u2013 a jamming box, you could say, to stop blasts and waves from entering the cock pit of the Lions.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s incredible, Pidge,\u201d Shiro said, pleased. \n\u201cOf course, I can\u2019t actually test it out with the specific technology that will turn us all into babies,\u201d Pidge continued, \u201cbut I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019ll work. When can I install it in everyone\u2019s Lions?\u201d\n\u201cWhenever you\u2019re free, go ahead,\u201d Shiro said. Hunk and Keith nodded in agreement. \nPidge\u2019s distraction was welcome. It was easier to listen to the Paladins discuss Voltron and their Lions rather than listen to the nagging doubts in Keith\u2019s head. \nThat evening, Keith snuck back into the healing pod room. He knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep and just the thought of being trapped in his room by himself made him feel revolted. He wouldn\u2019t be able to stand the heavy, pressing loneliness that had begun to suffocate the room. \nHe sat with his side resting against the healing pod. It was cold to the touch, but bearable. There was a slight humming from it that filled the silence of the room and like this, he felt a little more at ease. Sure, the floor was hard and uncomfortable and he kind of wished he\u2019d brought a blanket with him, but sitting next to Lance calmed him down. Allura had been right when she had said Lance was healing \u2013 his bruises were slowly but steadily disappearing and the tightness in his shoulders was unravelling. \nKeith didn\u2019t sleep, exactly, but surely something close enough to it to make him feel more rested than he had before. His eyes were closed and his breathing was even and the hours passed quicker than usual, but he was sure it wasn\u2019t sleep. He was still awake enough that when the front screen of the healing pod opened to spill cold wisps of air across him his eyes were open and he was conscious. \nIt must have been early morning for sure, if the aches in Keith\u2019s shoulders and neck were anything to go by, but he didn\u2019t care. He watched Lance stumble out of the healing pod and fall to his knees beside Keith, wobbly on his feet. He was groaning and holding his head, and then his hazy blue eyes lifted. \u201cKeith? Why are you on the floor?\u201d\nIt was a stupid question and definitely not the first one Keith would have asked, but that didn\u2019t matter. Lance\u2019s voice was a soothing balm to an ache in his head and his eyes were  definitely not wet  as he gaped at Lance. \u201cYou\u2019re normal,\u201d he finally choked out.\nLance\u2019s head tilted to the side. He looked kind of dopey like that, which made a harsh, short laugh come from Keith. Lance always looked dopey. \u201cWhy am I on the floor?\u201d Lance asked next. \u201cWhy you looking at me like you\u2019re gonna cry?\u201d\nKeith couldn\u2019t help it, he threw his arms around Lance and barked out that breathlessly relieved laugh again. \u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d he said, voice shaky. Lance\u2019s weight wasn\u2019t exactly back in his arms but it was definitely close enough.\n\u201cOkay man, you\u2019re being weird now,\u201d Lance slurred. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nKeith paused, and hesitantly pulled back. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201d\nLance gave him an oblivious look. \u201cRemember what? Why are you hugging me?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re don\u2019t remember,\u201d Keith said, heart abruptly sinking. The words didn\u2019t feel like they came from his mouth. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026 Don\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t remember what?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t remember.\nKeith, with his arms crossed tightly against his chest, anxiously watched Coran move around the infirmary. If he lowered them, he was sure they would show that he was shaking. He couldn\u2019t get them to stop no matter how hard he tried.\nLance was asleep, neatly tucked into one of the infirmary beds. An IV needle fed fluid into his system and senses monitored his heart rate. He was sleeping but he looked restless, like he might wake at any moment. They\u2019d moved him into the infirmary after he\u2019d woken from the healing pod and would keep him there until he woke properly.\nThe other Paladins knew what Lance had said, that he didn\u2019t remember. Lance had muttered as much when they\u2019d rushed into the room shortly after he\u2019d woken. At least Keith didn\u2019t seem to be the only one shaken up by Lance\u2019s strange ramblings. \n\u201cHe\u2019s not acting like himself,\u201d Hunk said, a worried frown on his face. \u201cDon\u2019t you think he\u2019s acting weird? What if his head didn\u2019t get fixed, or something?\u201d\n\u201cHunk, calm yourself,\u201d Allura said. \u201cAll scans are indicating that his re-growth process was completely successful. His diagnostics are similar enough to the ones recorded from before the attacks that I am sure his  head,  as you say, is perfectly fine.\u201d\n\u201cThen why is he all loopy?\u201d Pidge asked, tilting his head to the side curiously. He leaned across Lance to poke at Lance\u2019s cheek. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t normally act so clueless.\u201d\nAllura gave them a puzzled look. She clearly didn\u2019t understand earthen terms, but the meaning was fairly discernible. \u201cWell, I did up the dosage of his pain medication\u2026 It\u2019s likely he\u2019s still working through his system. It is Altaen, after all.\u201d\n\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Keith said, shaking his head as he stepped forwards. \u201cYou\u2019re saying Lance is drunk on alien pain meds?\u201d\n\u201cYes, quite possibly-\u201d\n\u201cAre you  serious?\u201d \n\u201cWell, yes-\u201d\n\u201cWhat the  hell,  Lance!\u201d  I\u2019m so going to punch him when he wakes up for this. \n\u00a0\nKeith lay in bed brooding for a long time that evening. He skipped dinner and couldn\u2019t be lured from his room, not even by Shiro, who knowingly didn\u2019t pester him for too long. He felt far too frazzled to be around anyone at the moment and much preferred his own silent company. There was too much going on in his head for him to focus any amount of attention on the others.\nIf Lance\u2019s mind was being muddled by the medication, did that mean he might still remember everything that had happened when he was stuck as a child? A deep, lonely part of Keith hoped so, even if Lance only remembered bits and pieces. He never felt alone on Allura\u2019s ship and the Paladins had certainly offered him a place amongst them, but he was still unable to make emotional connections with them, and it left him lonely in the face of their companionship.\nWhen he was with baby Lance, it had been different. For the first time, Keith had felt like he was truly needed for something other than Voltron. That if he were to leave, someone would throw a fit and act relentlessly to get him to return. Somehow, the fact that it was  Lance  of all people, even as a child, made his face burn. He never would have thought he\u2019d make such a bond with the Blue Paladin. They were almost designed to not get along \u2013 fire and ice, red and blue, good and bad. \nBeing away from everyone helped clear his head. He supposed not all habits could be shaken off so soon \u2013 that he\u2019d still crave complete silence every now and then. Tonight was just one of those times. If nothing else, it did give him a time to think everything over. Mostly, he thought about Lance. He still couldn\u2019t put words to what he was feeling, so he tried to put words to what he didn\u2019t want instead.\nHe didn\u2019t want to lose Lance.\nThat was obvious enough, he thought, so he tried again. He didn\u2019t want Lance to be in pain. He didn\u2019t want Lance to hide his homesickness from him anymore. He didn\u2019t want Lance to be lonely. When it came down to it, there were a lot of things he didn\u2019t want Lance to be (and in a roundabout way, that he wanted Lance to be \u2013 content and healthy, for example). Even if he wanted all of that, he couldn\u2019t control Lance, or the way Lance felt.\nHe could, however, control himself. Deciding what he wanted was harder, but knowing what he wanted for Lance helped. He supposed that a lot of it came down to Lance, in the end \u2013 if Lance would want his help, if Lance would accept any feelings Keith had for him, if Lance would want a bond or something more with him. If Lance did want it then- well, Keith did too.\nIt seemed ridiculously simple when he thought of it like that. How infuriating.\nSurprisingly, he slept fairly well that night. When he woke the next morning he suffered a brief bout of disorientated confusion in which he searched his room for Lance\u2019s crib \u2013 it had been happening for a while, but less commonly now \u2013 before waking completely. It was still hard to shake off those feelings; the ones that told him he should he looking after a child that was no longer around.\nWith a resigned sigh, he slipped out of bed. It would do him no good to mull over it for any longer, not when he\u2019d spent the night doing exactly that. Instead, he forced himself to get changed. Lance should be awake today, and Keith didn\u2019t want to linger in his room for longer than he needed to. \nHe was in the middle of pulling his undershirt over his head when his door suddenly hissed open. He jerked around, expecting to find Shiro or maybe Hunk peering it, but it was Lance that shoved his way through the doors. \n\u201cLance?\u201d Keith asked, shocked. \u201cWhat are you-?\u201d\nBefore he knew it he had Lance\u2019s arms thrown around him, half-pulled on shirt be damned. It took him an extravagantly long time to realise that the warmth he could feel on his chest was coming from Lance, and that the thing tickling his cheek was Lance\u2019s hair, still baby-soft and irresistibly silky. It took so long that Lance tensed and began to pull back, but Keith shifted, gripping the back of Lance\u2019s shirt as tightly as he could as he bit his lip hard enough to sting so that he wouldn\u2019t cry. \n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Keith whispered.\nLance shrugged. His shoulder awkwardly bumped Keith\u2019s chin, but Keith didn\u2019t care. \u201cI snuck out when Shiro wasn\u2019t looking,\u201d he said, sounding oddly proud of himself despite his quiet tone. \u201cHe told me what I said when I was off my head on pain meds.\u201d\nKeith stiffened. He stubbornly stared at the wall over Lance\u2019s shoulder and hoped that Lance couldn\u2019t feel the way his hands had started to uncontrollably shake again. \n\u201cYou know I didn\u2019t mean any of that, right man? I didn\u2019t even know what my name was,\u201d Lance said. His hands tightened around Keith, flattening across his back to make warm patches.\nKeith exhaled shakily, and forced his mouth to move. \u201cDo you remember anything?\u201d He asked. \u201cAnything from when\u2026 when you were de-aged?\u201d\nLance was quiet for a moment. \u201cKinda,\u201d he eventually murmured. His hand slid up Keith\u2019s arm, his touch feather-light, like he was trying to recall something by touch alone, until he finally came to rest it tangled in locks of hair at the base of Keith\u2019s neck. It sparked shivers that raced along Keith\u2019s skin. \u201cBits and pieces, like flashes of memories or something. Everything\u2026 everything that I remember feels really  raw,  like a fresh burn, but not bad. It\u2019s like everything I felt from then has been put under a microscope.\u201d\nKeith swallowed heavily. \u201cWas\u2026 Was it bad?\u201d\nLance shook his head.\n\u201cWas- was I\u2026 bad?\u201d\nLance tightened his grip, and shook his head.\nKeith felt like sagging and it was only through sheer will power that he made his knees keep him upright. What was he meant to do now? He didn\u2019t know what the next step was, what his next action should be, what he needed to do to make the racing of his heart settle.\nEventually, however, the strength seemed to slowly leave Lance. He was starting to shake with effort and if Keith had not had such a tight grip on him then he surely would have sunk to the floor. \u201cYou should probably go back to the infirmary,\u201d Keith said quietly. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Lance agreed.\nNeither one of them moved.\nWhen Lance\u2019s knees finally did give out, Keith held him up. Lance\u2019s arm was over his shoulders and his arm was around Lance\u2019s waist and he felt so incredibly close to him that it was overwhelming. Sure, Lance didn\u2019t smell the best after being in a healing pod for a week, but there was something undeniably familiar about him that unravelled an ache in Keith\u2019s chest. For the first time in what felt like ages, he wasn\u2019t worried.\n\u00a0\nIt only took half a day for Lance to regain his usual energy and attitude. Keith thought he might have been embarrassed over anything he did as a child, but he took it in his stride. In fact, he encouraged the others to tell him exactly what he\u2019d done when he realised how embarrassed it made  Keith. \n\u201cSo my first words were his name?\u201d Lance asked, grinning broadly even as Keith scowled at him. \u201cAnd I took my first steps towards him?\u201d\n\u201cNot to mention the staring,\u201d Pidge groaned. \u201cYou never stopped staring at him!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Hunk laughed. \u201cYou were always so focused on Keith\u2019s face!\u201d\n\u201cOh boy Keith, what were you brainwashing me with?\u201d\nKeith only scowled harder. \u201cLike I needed to. You were obsessed with me.\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019d use the word  smitten,  instead,\u201d Pidge cut in.\n\u201cStill am,\u201d Lance grinned wider.\nKeith flushed, glowering furiously. It was unfair that Lance could still tease him like this when Keith could feel the lingering warmth of Lance\u2019s weight pressed against him. It felt just the same as it had when Lance was a baby. \n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Shiro said, chuckling, \u201chow about we go get something to eat, then? Lance, you must be hungry.\u201d\nLance groaned. \u201cStarving!\u201d\n\u00a0\nKeith thought about what Shiro had told him later that evening. He sat in the observatory room watching the stars and thought about how he could possibly show Lance what he was feeling rather than saying it. What action said  I want you to hug me more because it makes me feel less lonely, but only if you want to? \n\u201cYou\u2019re really good at disappearing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Lance said as he suddenly appeared beside Keith. His voice wasn\u2019t cold and he had a warm look to his eyes that put Keith at ease.\n\u201cWhen I want to,\u201d he answered.\nLance huffed out a small laugh. He took a seat beside Keith and stretched out his long legs and for a moment, they were both blissfully quiet. Then, Lance mumbled, \u201cThanks for looking after me.\u201d\nKeith startled at the comment and gave Lance a confused look. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me,\u201d he said.\nLance unexpectedly leaned forwards, pressing his forehead against Keith\u2019s chest to hide his expression. \u201cI do,\u201d he said, \u201cso don\u2019t say I don\u2019t. Allura told me that if I had gotten stressed or hurt then I might not have turned back normal. You kept me safe.\u201d\nKeith swallowed heavily.  Show, if you can\u2019t tell.  Tentatively, he lifted hand to rest his palm on the back of Lance\u2019s head. His hair was still irresistibly soft, even more so now that he had showered, and Keith couldn\u2019t help but press his nose into it just like he had when Lance was a baby. \u201cThe others helped,\u201d he pointed out.\nGently, Lance\u2019s hand came to rest on Keith\u2019s waist. The touch didn\u2019t startle him anymore. \u201cNot in the way you did,\u201d Lance insisted. \u201cThe way you helped was different. Wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 think so,\u201d Keith nodded. He sounded more sure than his words implied him to be.\nLance\u2019s hand pressed up against his chest. \u201cYour heart is racing,\u201d he murmured. His breath was hot against Keith\u2019s collarbones.\nKeith nodded.\n\u201cIs it because of me?\u201d\nHe nodded again.\nIt was with an incredible amount of gentle but swift prodding that Lance managed to pull Keith down onto the floor. Keith suddenly found himself staring into beautifully dark skies surrounded by a halo of stars only to realise that, with a small noise, the skies were in fact found in Lance\u2019s eyes.\nLance\u2019s hands were pinning Keith\u2019s down, but his grip wasn\u2019t tight. He seemed just as surprised as Keith was as he loomed over him. Their faces were close enough that Keith could feel the warmth of Lance\u2019s breath and see the incredibly faint shadows his eyelashes cast across his cheeks. \nFor a moment, Keith thought Lance would kiss him.\nBut Lance didn\u2019t, and Keith was glad. That was going too fast not only for him, but for Lance as well. Instead, Lance let out a happy bout of relieved laughter. He stuffed his face in Keith\u2019s neck and collapsed across him, his knees planted on either side of Keith\u2019s hips. \u201cYour heart is still racing,\u201d he said.\nKeith hummed. Lance\u2019s weight was pressing him down, anchoring him. Lance\u2019s hands had come up to pillow Keith\u2019s head against the cold, hard surface of the floor. It was quiet except for the exhilarated breathes and the ever-present humming of the castle. Then, Keith spoke. \u201cLance?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2026 Can we be boyfriends?\u201d\nLance smiled into his neck; Keith could feel Lance\u2019s lips taking shape against his throat. \u201cYeah.\u201d"
