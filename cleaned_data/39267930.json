    "text": "\nDark alleyways and downtown areas, all falling apart at the seams and colored with the vibrancy of the people who live there and the art that\u2019s painted onto walls of abandoned buildings. It's a place where the people have their own rules and the law stays as far as possible away, deeming it too \u2018violent\u2019 and \u2018dangerous\u2019 to save. The heroes themselves stick to the brighter, richer, \n\nnicer \n\nneighborhoods and the resident\u2019s of this area don\u2019t mind.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter all, they\u2019ve done just fine without any interference.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKeep to yourself, don\u2019t tread on what\u2019s not your business, and no matter what happens keep your nose out of the underground\u2019s dealings. Criminals, vigilante\u2019s, villains, under\u2019s, morally gray civilians, you name it. They all live here, the downtown of Musutafu, and they coexist in a strange form of harmony that\u2019s reliant on the implicit rules that whisper in ears and haunt the lives of those who break them. Of course, there are some who break these rules, and suffer the consequences but there is one rule that no one in their right mind has ever broken.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHealing quirks are uncommon. Especially the kinds that are powerful enough for the rough style of life you find in either the underground or heroic\u2019s industry. Recovery girl for example, is a one in a million kind of person. Her quirk is a godsend for those who constantly face life-threatening dangers. The HPSC makes it a point to prioritize all healing quirks, snatching up the one\u2019s strong enough or fast tracking those the weaker ones you find in the high end hero wards and hospitals. Healer\u2019s who stick to the underground are \n\nrare\n\n. After all, why spend time in the shitty and violent underground when you could be paid top dollar at a nice hospital and get the HPSC approved security to keep you safe?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo there is only one explicitly stated rule in the underground:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nKeep Your Hands Off The Healer.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe last time someone disobeyed that rule? Well, let's just say not even Tartarus will keep you safe from the consequences.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d Shouta all but barked into his com\u2019s, holding up a hand to keep his intern still while he waited for Joke to come to a stop on the rooftop next to their own, \u201cdisengage.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEraserhead,\u201d he heard come from behind him, Hypno\u2019s voice a smooth drawl despite the obvious confusion in it, \u201cwhy are we stopping? The villains right there?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith a heavy sigh, he gestured for Shinsou to get closer before he spoke, pitching his voice into a low murmur.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s your lesson on the only explicit rule of the underground,\u201d he said, the sharpness of his voice carrying the weight of the importance of his words, \u201chealers are untouchable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHealers?\u201d Shinsou hedged, his voice pitched into a similar whisper.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHealers are rare, Hypno. Even in our industry there\u2019s only a handful capable enough to handle healing outside of a hospital environment. For the underground that doesn\u2019t have the luxury of the HPSC\u2019s stalking tendencies to find and hide away their healers, it\u2019s even more uncommon to see one.\u201d He shifted a bit to get comfortable, cursing himself for being too slow to catch the guy they were after before they reached this area.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the time to get into the other relevant information such as why we stopped here even though there looks to be nowhere for the villain to go, but the short answer is that this is neutral territory \n\nbecause \n\nthere\u2019s a healer here. The underground protects their healers by declaring them a \u2018no go\u2019. They are not allowed to be harmed or coerced in any way. Some prisoners in Tartarus are there because they stepped out of line with a healer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo then the person who overlooks this area\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs a healer, yes,\u201d he looked up, hearing a small scuff from above him, \u201cand you\u2019re about to see them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nOn the tallest building nearby was a person. Their body obscured by the oversized jacket and loose pants that were dark black with bright green highlights that seemed to actually glow. Actually, as the figure got closer- jumping off the roof and onto the next before meandering their way over to where the villain they had been currently chasing sat- he realized that his clothes \n\nwere \n\nglowing. He also realized his original guess had been correct, he knew exactly who this was.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs that a kitsune mask?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered back to Shinsou, keeping his eyes on the healer, \u201cHis alias is Kitsune, nicknamed Kit by a few of his more regular clients, but his title is \u2018The Sukunahikona\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Shinsou shifted, leaning closer a bit to get a better look at the figure. \u201cLike the deity? \n\nThat \n\nSukunahikona?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cExactly that,\u201d he murmured back.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Shinsou started, an edge to his voice that Shouta knew all too well, \u201cthey certainly got the height for it, or well, lack of it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBrat,\u201d he griped, shoving down the urge to smile as he kept an eye on the interaction in front of them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEraser,\u201d he heard over the coms, \u201cI\u2019ve got access to the nearby security cameras, sending you the audio feed now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d he responded back before falling silent as he heard the tell tale beep of a line being connected.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKitsune,\u201d he heard the man they had been chasing rush out, watching the man shift in real time, \u201cSorry to randomly drop in like this.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh so they get a sorry,\u201d Shinsou griped, \u201cbut when he ruins my suit I get a \u2018take that you overgrown shit-stain\u2019, this is a hate crime.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHush,\u201d he hissed, as funny as his intern was, this was \n\nnot the time\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo you say,\u201d came a robotic-like voice, it sounded androgynous and vaguely artificial in a way that had goosebumps rising on his arms.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUm,\u201d he heard Shinsou pipe up behind him and sighed under his breath, wondering what he might say but also regretting letting him continue, \u201cwhy is he holding a bat?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Shouta realized, he had forgotten exactly what Kitsune\u2019s quirk was for a second, \u201cwell at least the natural law of karma still works on this godforsaken planet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust watch.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo how did you manage this,\u201d Kitsune vaguely gestured to the rather large gash on the man\u2019s arm, his Kitsune mask letting out a puff of steam from the mouth as the green glowing eyes seemed to focus on the wound, \u201cyou\u2019re not the type to get into high stakes scenarios.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI, uh,\u201d the villain stammered, looking down at the ground now before mumbling, \u201cI tripped while running away from Eraserhead and his brat intern.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nBrat\n\n?\u201d Shinsou hissed before Shouta, not so kindly, shoved him for the volume.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKoichiro,\u201d Kitsune sighed, \u201chow in hell did you manage to get on Eraserhead's shit list?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI forgot he shifted his patrol route,\u201d the villain- Koichiro apparently- grumbled, \u201ccan we please move past this?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith a heavy sigh, Kitsune raised their bat and twirled it around in an elaborate trick before grabbing the base in a secure grip.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBite some cloth,\u201d Kitsune ordered flatly, \u201cyou\u2019re in for a real treat.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWithout further stalling, Kitsune raised and swung the bat in a solid movement, the distinct sound of metal hitting flesh \n\nhard \n\nechoing loudly in the air. Shinsou let out a choked garble of sounds, obviously holding back the numerous thoughts such a sight would cause. Koichiro slammed back into the brick wall of the building he had sat next to and Kitsune reeled back for another swing. With another painful metallic thunk, they dropped the bat carelessly onto the ground before kneeling over the limp body they had just produced. Reaching, they placed a hand onto the man\u2019s bicep. The limb produced a neon green glow that slowly enveloped the villain. Seeping into the body. Not long after the green subsided and the body jerked a bit before going still and Kitsune stood back up. The large gash and other wounds- caused by a metal baseball bat- all missing from where they had been previously.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNow Eraser,\u201d he heard over the coms and he sighed, he should have known they would notice, \u201cI believe you know my rules.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he sighed, fully sitting down now instead of the crouch he was in before, \u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Kitsune chirped, another steam puff floating away from him, \u201cdon\u2019t forget to let your devil child know as well.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d he smirked, ignoring the squawk from behind him, \u201cnow go do whatever else it is you do, Kit.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that at least my hobbies are respectable,\u201d he heard Kitsune grumble, the voice wobbling harshly as it tried to convey emotion through the artificial tone, \u201cunlike you who wiggles around in a sleeping bag all day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI would ask how you know about that,\u201d he grouched, \u201cbut I have a pretty good idea already on how.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTell your husband I say hello,\u201d Kitsune, the little shit they are, said, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since he got caught up in the south side.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYea,\u201d he flatly responded, remembering the dazed expression his husband had come home with that day, \u201cI wonder why.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault my quirk works like this,\u201d they giggled, \u201cNo pain, no gain am I right?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUgh,\u201d he scoffed, ignoring the cackles he heard over the end before the healer picked up their bat.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKitsune turned then, bat slung over their shoulder as they raised their other hand. Giving the two of them a cheeky wave before he disappeared into the alleyways.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Shinsou piped up from where he was silently watching over the alleys, \u201cKitsune\u2019s quirk heals but only after they what? Knock out their patient?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he corrected, \u201ctheir quirk, as stated by them, is essentially the physical manifestation of no pain no gain. They have to injure their patient before they heal them. Apparently, the more injured you are the more they have to injure you in return because their quirk only heals as much as they damage.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOw,\u201d Shinsou shuddered, \u201cokay yea no thanks, wait\u2026 You said their \n\nregular \n\nclients nicknamed them kit. You called them kit.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKitsune\u2019s rules state that the chase can only start once their patient has woken up,\u201d he bulldozed over the question, ignoring the absolute glee and horror that had crossed Shinsou\u2019s face, \u201cSo be ready to engage Hypno, he\u2019ll wake in another minute.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nOh my god-\n\n\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nShut\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Hitoshi apologized, wincing at the rather large coffee stain on the stranger he had just bumped into, \u201creally, I should\u2019ve been paying better attention.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nGod he just wanted the ground to swallow him whole. He had come to this caf\u00e9 for two reasons. One, it had cats. Two, he had been up until 4 in the morning chasing Koichiro down with Aizawa-sensei- or just Aizawa now, considering he had graduated a month- and had been struck with a bout of insomnia at the same time. Unsurprisingly, he was running on fumes at the moment and coffee and cats seemed like a good idea. Now that he was frantically looking around for some napkins, the stranger in front of him flailing around as he spouted his own bout of apologies, he was starting to doubt it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nActually nah, he would\u2019ve still come here if he knew this was going to happen.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWide green eyes nervously flicked up and down from his own eyes to the floor. Sun-kissed skin covered in thousands of freckles framing them in a way that added just the right amount of \n\nsoft\n\n to his facial structure, decorating the roundest cheeks. Which, it was unfair for someone so cute and soft looking to have a jawline that sharp. What made the image a hundred times worse, or better depending on what part of his brain you focused on, was the emerald green curls that looked like a cloud on the stranger's head. Every time they made a slight movement the curls bounced and bobbed and it was adorable. How \n\nunfair\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo really it\u2019s fine! I wasn\u2019t really paying attention myself,\u201d the stranger rambled, still flustered and flailing as they apologized for a mistake Hitoshi made, \u201cso you don\u2019t have to apologize for anything, really! I\u2019ll just go-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLet me buy you a coffee,\u201d he immediately said, his own filter fucking right off when he needed it most, \u201cIt was my fault after all, let me get you one as an apology.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI- I-\u201d The stranger stammered, cheeks dusting a slight pink as they wringed their hands. \u201cOkay?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nPerfect\n\n,\u201d he all but purred, content with approval as he gestured towards the booth he had just been heading to, \u201csit down and I\u2019ll go grab it, any preference?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cA gingerbread iced coffee with cream and an extra shot of espresso?\u201d They hedged, nervous and shy.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d he smiled, \u201cand a name to use for it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh! Midoriya Izuku,\u201d Midoriya quickly responded, a small smile on his own face, \u201cand you\u2019re\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShinsou, Shinsou Hitoshi,\u201d he responded, giving Midoriya a final nod before escaping to the counter to order the drink. Ignoring the way his brain was blaring warning signals in his mind.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe knew he could be snarky and sarcastic when it came to the front he pulls up when flustered, but \n\nflirty\n\n? Since when does he get flirty? He\u2019s not Kaminari for crying out loud!\n\n\u00a0\n\n(He resolutely ignores the way he can feel Midoriya's stare on his back, pretending it doesn\u2019t affect him even as he stands just a little bit straighter.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter waiting a few minutes, he walked back over to the booth with two coffees in hand. His own coffee had been spilled all over the tiles, much to the workers displeasure.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said once close enough, sliding the drink Midoriya asked for in front of him as he slid into the other side of the booth, \u201cas ordered.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Midoriya breathed, latching onto the drink like a man dying of thirst in the desert.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLet me guess,\u201d he drawled, eyes roaming the freckled face of his new coffee companion for the day, \u201crough night?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt sure looked like it, especially with how deep the eyebags on Midoriya's face looked.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou could say that,\u201d Midoriya laughed, still a bit nervous but relaxing slightly, \u201cinsomnia\u2019s a bitch.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat it is,\u201d he nodded solemnly, raising a hand to give a mock salute, \u201cgood luck soldier, that\u2019s not a fight easily won.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMidoriya snorted, the sound muffled by the hand he had brought up to cover the lower half of his face, before he let out a few giggles.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe rest of their afternoon passed just like that, with casual conversation and a few jokes here and there. The longer they got to speak the more attractive Midoriya got, except, it wasn\u2019t his looks that attracted him. No, it was Midoriya as a person that he was focused on now. He started out shy and nervous but the more they talked the more he came out of his shell until he started to go on full tangents. More than one of which were about specific heroes Midoriya looked up too. He had to bite back a smirk when he heard about how Eraserhead, an underground hero that's usually not even heard of let alone known to the extent Midoriya knows, was the man\u2019s favorite hero. Midoriya was sweet but he also had a snarky side to him that came out every now and then to bite back at some of his statements. Hitoshi was living for it, the small smile he had from the beginning only grew in size the longer they spoke.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, as time passed Hitoshi could only ignore the consistent buzzing of his phone a couple of times before Midoriya noticed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUm,\u201d Midoriya glanced at the place where his phone had been flipped down on the table, it was currently doing its best to vibrate right off onto the floor, \u201cyour phone?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d with a quick movement, he flipped his phone over, checked the name, then swiped end before turning it back over again, \u201csorry about that, continue.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI,\u201d Midoriya started, his eyes stuck to where his phone had started vibrating again, \u201cthat seems important?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo not really,\u201d he shrugged, \u201cjust an acquaintance.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAn acquaintance that seems to be extremely persistent,\u201d Midoriya drawled, staring at the phone pointedly, \u201cI don\u2019t mind if you answer it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith a dramatic sigh, which earned him a snort, he flipped his phone over once more and answered the call. Making sure to keep a relatively safe distance between his ear and the phone before he spoke.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHIIIIIII! You\u2019re so mean! I\u2019ve been calling for ages!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMidoriya winced in front of him, rubbing at his ear sympathetically as he moved the phone even further away from his own.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he responded flatly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA gasp rang clear through the phone, \u201chave you been ignoring me?!?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he easily returned, ignoring the squawk he received to watch as Midoriya muffled his giggles with a hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo rude! Here I was being a good friend and all and intending to-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIntending\u2019s a big word for you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c-\n\nhush\n\n, invite you over to the squads movie night and yet here you are being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSince when was I a part of a squad?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an honorary member of course,\u201d Kaminari returned easily, \u201csince you never explicitly stated whether you were a part of the Todosquad or the Bakusquad you kinda just got a position in both.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTake it back,\u201d he immediately responded, \u201crescind the offer, I refuse.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo take backsies,\u201d the absolute child refuted, \u201cstuck with us for life! As Eijirou would say, \u2018best bro\u2019s for lifesies\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis time Midoriya couldn\u2019t quite hold back the cackle he made, tossing a hand over his mouth in a hurry to silence himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHitoshi,\u201d he heard Kaminari say through the phone, dreading the obvious grin in his tone, \u201care you on a date?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nImmediately Midoriya flushed a bright neon red that had him thinking of strawberries.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said back, ignoring the wide eyed stare he got to instead focus on how impossible it seemed for Midoriya to get even redder despite the physical evidence in front of him, \u201cnow if you excuse me I\u2019d like to get back to it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI \n\nexpect \n\ndetails, you hear me Hitoshi? I want all the details when you-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith swift movement, he brought the phone away from his ear and tapped the bright red button to end the call. Placing the phone back down on the table in front of him before he looked back up at Midoriya. The same Midoriya who looked about 2 seconds away from having steam blow out of his ears.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he started with, nervously scratching at the back of his neck, \u201cwhile I would 100% love for this to be a date, I understand if you wouldn\u2019t like tha-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Midoriya rushed out, eyes staring determinedly at the table as he rushed the words out of his mouth, \u201cI, I would really like that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he breathed, a sense of relief washing over him, \u201cthen you should call me Hitoshi.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIzuku then,\u201d Izuku smiled, \u201cit's only fair.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe first time Shouta had ever met Kitsune, it had been when the Kit had just started out. The Kitsune mask had been just a regular black medical mask and they had dressed in dark fitted clothing, the only similarity in sight being the baseball bat they clearly favored. They had a young, very young, voice that was more on the masculine scale with no artificial voice changer in sight. They were making quite a name for themselves, though they hadn\u2019t received a title yet, and already had a \u2018no go\u2019 brand in the underground.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe had, admittedly, been a bit too reckless that night. His focus having been distracted by the injuries his husband had sustained on a raid the night before that had him in the hospital. So it came as no surprise that a criminal had caught him off guard. Unsurprising but startling. It really was just a minor wound- in his opinion- as the blade he had been stabbed with was hardly that long. Sure he may have had a concussion too from the criminals partner that had used his distracted state, due to the stabbing, to slam him into a wall but had managed to get them tied up securely enough to call Tsukauchi to send retrieval cops.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKit had plopped down from a roof then and walked over, fussing over his state while he kinda just stared blankly at him. When the Kit had asked if he had called an ambulance, and while he understood now that it might have been a good idea to do so past him decidedly did \n\nnot\n\n, he had responded with- and he\u2019s not proud of this- \u2018tis but a flesh wound\u2019.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Kitsune stated flatly, eyeing the knife still poking out of his right thigh with wary resignation that came from dealing with numerous patients who were hyped up on adrenaline, \u201cyea I don\u2019t think the knife in your thigh agrees.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEh,\u201d he responded, his head snapping down to look without much thought to the weird fuzz he felt in his brain, \u201cjust a small stabbing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c...being stabbed in no way can be considered \n\nsmall\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe knife was small,\u201d he retorted immediately, \u201cergo small stabbing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Kitsune had muttered to themselves before they had sighed and moved to grab his bat.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShouta, who was still high off of the brain's version of painkiller and energy drink combo, blinked slowly at the sight.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Kitsune said, eyes crinkling like they do when someone smiles, \u201cI\u2019ll just provide you with a small nap.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cA nap sounds nice,\u201d he said, then everything after that was black.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo yea, the first time he had met Kitsune was an experience to say the least.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis was not how I expected to meet you,\u201d Hypno said as he stared up at him from the ground, \u201chonest.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSomehow,\u201d Izuku sighed, face palming as he slowly shook his head in exasperation, \u201cI should've known you would take after your mentor.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Hypno questioned, his head wobbling around from the, no doubt, concussion he had received.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cStab wound and everything,\u201d he sighed, gesturing to the knife sticking out of Hypno\u2019s left thigh.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNot the same one Eraser had received his in but close enough.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Hypno whined, \u201cit\u2019s not that deep. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGod, you even sound the same while injured.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really an injury per say-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere. Is. A. Knife. In. Your. Thigh.\u201d Izuku punctuated each word with a tap of his bat on the ground. \u201cThat counts as an injury Hypno, you\u2019ve just been stabbed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Hypno mumbled a bit deliriously, \u201c\n\nI\u2019m allergic\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Kitsune sighed, \u201cnap time it is.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh I love naps-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith a swift swing, Izuku knocked Hypno out with a single blow.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he heard Aizawa drawl behind him from where he was giving an incident report to Tsukauchi, the detective himself studiously ignoring the interruption as he worked on quieting his laughter, \u201cI heard you had a run in with Kitsune?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he denied, \u201cI met god.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Aizawa said, the smirk in his voice had him groaning into the desk he had face planted in, \u201cI know you didn\u2019t meet god because you would have an injury from the resulting throw down. In fact, your \n\nsuspiciously \n\ninjury free for someone Tsukauchi found passed out on a rooftop.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUgh,\u201d he groaned.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he heard Aizawa continue, \u201chow was your first time?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d he sighed, \u201ceverything blank after I was told it was-\u201d he stopped midway and snapped his jaw closed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Aizawa, the menace and sadist he is, asked, \u201cdid Kitsune say? You\u2019ll have to tell Tsukauchi after all.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTsukauchi, the betrayer, looked like he was living for this.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d the man said, \u201cI\u2019ll need it for the report.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI hate you,\u201d Hitoshi seethed, \u201cI loathe the very air you breathe.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d Aizawa raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAfter I,\u201d he hesitated before groaning into his hands, \u201cafter he told me I got stabbed in the thigh and I said \u2018Oh no, I\u2019m allergic\u2019, he said \u2018okay, nap time it is\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHonestly, it was rude to cackle at your prot\u00e9g\u00e9 like that after he just got stabbed. Yes, he was ignoring the fact that he was healed already, he still has the mental trauma damnit.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAt least try to muffle them,\u201d he snapped, not really angry but still offended, \u201cwhat if I was scarred forever because I was \n\nstabbed\n\n?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSomehow, I doubt you are.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou never know.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI do-\u201d Aizawa stopped suddenly and turned to face Tsukauchi, changing the subject to whatever case he had been working on previously but Hitoshi could see the story unfolding before him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSpill,\u201d he demanded.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI spilled, that means you spill. Now spill.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nNo\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\u2018Tis but a flesh wound\u2019 Eraser had stated, in return Kitsune had said \u2018yea I don\u2019t think the knife sticking out of your thigh agrees\u2019,\u201d Tsukauchi started to recite, a paper he had been shuffling around to look for now firmly in his hands, \u201c\u2018Eh, just a small stabbing\u2019 Eraser had replied-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTsukauchi,\u201d Aizawa hissed even as Hitoshi launched up from his seat.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat's why they said I was just like you,\u201d he gasped before realizing what he said.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstantly, Tsukauchi started cackling. Actual tears started to stream down his face as he tried to wipe them away. Aizawa had frozen still before slumping into the nearby chair with a loud and dramatic groan.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nOh my god\n\n,\u201d Tsukauchi had whispered hysterically, \u201c\n\nthat's\u00a0too fucking funny\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\nShut\n,\u201d he and Aizawa hissed in unison, one with bright glowing red eyes and the other with a voice heavy with laced quirk intent.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku had started dating Hitoshi, and boy was it still weird yet nice to think about, 3 months ago. Within that time, he had come to several revelations.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFirst and foremost, Hitoshi was definitely Hypno. The hero he had knocked out recently because they had been in the same delirious haze their mentor had been the first time he had met the man. Honestly, the two were a little too similar for supposedly not being blood related. The second most important discovery was, based on the phone call he had taken on their first \u2018date\u2019, a graduate of UA highschool. A class A graduate at that. Which means he had been in Bakugo\u2019s class.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhy is this relevant you ask? Well, he was currently debating on what kind of outfit to wear to the class A reunion because Hitoshi- sweet Hitoshi- had asked him to come with. Stating something along the lines of how he wanted to show his friends who he was dating and spend more time with him. It was sweet, incredibly so, but now he was faced with a dilemma. Either he goes flashy- a nice outfit he had picked out that he knew Hitoshi would love- or something to help him blend in and avoid the blonde\u2019s gaze.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey hadn\u2019t really spoken since his first year of middle school. His Mom had arranged for them to move after their discovery of his quirk- something they had never discovered previously due to his quirkless \u2018diagnosis\u2019 and the fact that he had been adamant against hurting people- to prevent the usual series of events healers go through. Which was chalked up to what he and his Mom called the \u2018HPSC Stalker Protocol\u2019. His Mom had firmly stated that she would not tolerate having her precious baby kidnapped for a corrupt organization's whims and had called up his Dad to get the ball rolling so they could hide his quirk from pry eyes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nApparently, \u2018work in America\u2019 really meant \u2018intelligence agency needed a long term position filled to gather intel on a big bad\u2019. Who knew.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShaking his head to ignore those thoughts, Izuku picked up his phone and swiped through his contacts until he reached \u2018Mad Hatter With A Wrench\u2019.\n\n\u00a0\n\n-\n\n\nMad Hatter With A Wrench\n\n\u00a0\n\nRepressedAngerIssues:\n Hey quick question\n\n\u00a0\n\nRepressedAngerIssue\n: Also did you change my name again???\n\n\u00a0\n\nMadHatterWithAWrench\n: Go ahead and lay it on me! (of course)\n\n\u00a0\n\nRepressedAngerIssues\n: (Of course you did (\u21c0\u2038\u21bc\u2036)) Flashy outfit or blend in\n\n\u00a0\n\nMadHatterWithAWrench\n: Is this about the party? I say go flashy!\n\n\u00a0\n\nRepressedAngerIssues\n: But what about bomb bitch?\n\n\u00a0\n\nMadHatterWithAWrench\n: Slay so hard he keels over from a heart attack due to the sheer power of mesh slits\n\n\u00a0\n\nRepressedAngerIssues\n: \n\nMei\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n-\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith sigh, and a begrudgingly fond smile, Izuku reached into his closet and grabbed out the outfit he had planned to use at some point on a date with Hitoshi.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHitoshi had started dating Izuku 3 months ago and he was still riding that high. Though, he had noticed some things that he had decided early on to accept as easily as he did everything else about his boyfriend.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFirst revelation was, he\u2019s like 99% sure Izuku was actually Kitsune. After the initial quirk sharing moment one does after a bit of dating- like the post-quirk version of 21 questions- where Izuku had merely said he had a healing quirk with a rather extreme drawback and then proceeded to expertly derail that conversation he had a sneaking suspicion. It was somewhat confirmed that night when he was knocked out because Kitsune, despite the artificial voice, had used the same verbiage and gestures Izu did when trying to get him to take a nap.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWas he going to say anything that would risk his identity reaching the police? Absolutely not.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs Aizawa always said, under\u2019s were just vigilante\u2019s with a license. He operates on the undergrounds rules as much as the people in the underground do.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSecond revelation was his boyfriend had a horrible sense of fashion that relied on cringy t-shirts and hoodies that made people take a second glance because \u2018\n\nno way it actually said that\n\n\u2019. Honestly, his alias and underground persona dressed up in badass streetwear but \n\nIzuku \n\nchose shirts like his pajama top which was just a wite t-shirt with \u201cpajamas\u201d printed on it?\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, when he had looked up from the \u2018I\u2019m here\u2019 text Izuku had sent him as he waited at the street light near where the party was going to be, he had crashed into error codes at what he saw.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, sounding breathless to his own ears, \u201c\n\noh\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Izuku asked, his eyes sparkling in a way that betrayed the innocence he was trying to portray.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give me that,\u201d he rushed out, eyes scanning the outfit Izuku wore with an intense focus,\u00a0 \u201cyou look good.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy thank you,\u201d Izuku smiled genuinely, \u201cI know I normally wear those t-shirts and hoodies you hate-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe last one said \u2018Pink Fold-Up Table\u2019 for no reason.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c-but I got this outfit to surprise you,\u201d he easily ignored the jab and gave a little spin to show the outfit off easily, \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cVery much so,\u201d he agreed, \u201cyou ready?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLead the way,\u201d Izuku chirped, hooking his arm around his own as they walked towards the karaoke joint Kaminari had picked out.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey had reached the door, already hearing the obnoxious sounds of UA\u2019s \u2018golden graduates\u2019 class as they partied it up inside, when Izuku had casually said:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh and I also knew Bakugo back when we were kids,\u201d he nonchalantly mentioned as Hitoshi went to open the door, \u201cand he hated my guts so don\u2019t mind the bluster.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWait Izu, what did you just say?!?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSure enough, the moment they had stepped into the room- Izuku\u2019s hand firmly encased in his own- they had a solid 10 seconds of peace before all hell broke loose.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFirst one to break it had been Jirou, who looked Izu up and down before shouting with a smirk, \u201cDamn, I might be lesbian but even I can tell he\u2019s attracive as all hell. Nice game.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis had led to a sharp grin spreading across Izu\u2019s face even as Ashido squealed, jumping up and down in her seat as she pointed towards him with a gasp.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHitoshi!\u201d She shouted with Kaminari. \u201cYou brought your man!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDeku?!?\u201d Was the next and final shout to reach their ears, causing him to send a sharp glare in Bakugo\u2019s direction because that had sounded suspiciously close to-\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKacchan,\u201d Izuku said sweetly, his eyes shading a sharp vibrant green that almost seemed to glow and yep, he was definitely Kitsune, \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKa-\u201d Kaminari coughed, disbelieving and wide eyes staring at Izuku before he turned to Bakugo, the rest of the Bakusquad all collectively losing their shit with laughter, \u201c\n\nKacchan\n\n?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBro,\u201d Kirishima started, trying to get words out between his cackles, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell us you had an old friend? Such a c- \n\ncute \n\nnickname too.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSHUT IT,\u201d Bakugo screeched, surprisingly gentle hands removing Kirishima\u2019s arms from around him as he glared like a petulant child, \u201cSTOP SAYING IT!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he idly commented as he brought Izuku to sit with him in the booth the Todosquad had taken up residence on, \u201cgood to know you two got your shit together then.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHAAAH?\u201d Bakugo snapped, though the raised eyebrow he gave was surprisingly serious.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he gestured vaguely to the way Kirishima was hanging off of him slightly, \u201cthe whole horrific pining you two had going on in third year?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHonestly, he couldn\u2019t tell if it was more disturbing to realize Bakugo could blush or that he could have feelings like a regular human. After looking at him screeching like a small and very angry dog with a blush deep enough to be seen from the very back of the room, he decided it was both. Both were equally as disturbing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith Kirishima\u2019s special privileges as the key to the deeply constipated Pomeranian's heart, they managed to get everything under control enough to enjoy the rest of the night without too much bluster. It had been, admittedly, fun to spend some time with the casual chaos Class A always seemed to have surrounding them. They hadn\u2019t even needed to stop for a random villain attack as they were so prone to attracting so it was a success overall. Sure, he was teased the entire time but Izuku had been there so he hadn\u2019t minded half as much as he would. The way Izu would blush each time someone brought up their relationship had been \n\nvery \n\nentertaining.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey left the building and leisurely made their way towards the train station. His hand wrapped around Izu\u2019s shoulders as he buried himself into Hitoshi\u2019s side. Leeching off his warmth as the chill of the night air whipped past them. It was a comfortable silence, just them basking in each other's presence as they winded down from the social behavioral zoo Class A interactions were.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until he could see the train station that he spoke up, deliberately making his tone casual even as he felt a smirk spreading across his face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll take a break from the Kit activities tonight right? This must\u2019ve been exhausting after all.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYea,\u201d Izuku mumbled, rubbing his eyes, \u201cI probably should. It won\u2019t do me any good to go out while tired. I might have a\u2026 Hitoshi.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIzuku.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou sly bastard,\u201d Izuku giggled, but there was a tense line to his shoulders that gave away his anxiety.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d he agreed, scrambling for the right words to use before he gave up, blunt was his best form of communication after all, \u201cand I don\u2019t plan on ending up in a ditch just to be an ass Izuku. I lo- like you a lot and would rather keep my boyfriend out of custody.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku\u2019s shoulders relaxed then, slumping further into his side before he spoke up again, \u201cthank you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he agreed, \u201cI worship the ground you walk on Izu. keeping your alias a secret is literally bare minimum compared to what I\u2019d do for you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBold words from someone who said they were allergic to being stabbed,\u201d Izuku quipped.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh god,\u201d he realized with a jolt, \u201cof fuck that \n\nwas \n\nyou.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI thought we established this?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe did but I\u2019ve partially blocked that memory out because of the sheer embarrassment I had. Nap time? Really Izu? What am I, 5???\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cActed like it,\u201d Izuku sighed dramatically, \u201csaying your fine after being stabbed. You\u2019re exactly like Eraser in that sense.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat's \n\noffensive\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n(2 years later)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKitsune,\u201d Shouta greeted, curious as to why the healer was getting this close. He doesn\u2019t remember getting stabbed at any point tonight.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEraser,\u201d Kitsune greeted back with a puff of steam, \u201chow\u2019s your boy doing?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat was another development he loathed. After a particularly bad encounter back when Hypno was his intern and not a fellow experienced colleague, he had accidentally let it known that he saw Hitoshi as a son. It had ended with a lot of tears and agreements but unsurprisingly Kitsune- who had shown up in record time and healed Hitoshi immediately and without the usual dramatics- had latched onto that and now uses it to mercilessly tease him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d he grouched, narrowing his eyes, \u201cyou know that already stop asking.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKitsune did know, he knew that. Hitoshi had been oddly close with the healer. Close enough that when asked Hitoshi had said \u2018yes I do know his real name and no I won\u2019t share\u2019. Understandable as he would do the same.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSometimes he knew deep down the only thing that made him different from the others in the underground was the plastic rectangle shoved into his utility belt in case he was mistaken as a rather aggressive homeless person who took the law into their hands again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Kitsune cackled and he sighed, begrudgingly fond of the healer despite it all.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAwe,\u201d a familiar voice pouted, \u201chaving fun without me?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHitoshi, Hypno in costume, said as he lifted himself over the ledge of the roof. Walking over to join the two of them with his mask hanging from his neck.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAs much fun as it was to teach your hell class.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo a blast from the past?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI would give my other leg up if it meant never having to deal with all of you in a contained area ever again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou love us,\u201d Hitoshi cooed, \u201cdon\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAs much fun as this is to watch,\u201d Kitsune chirped, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure your break is up \u2018Raser.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d he sighed, slumping even further, \u201cgod I need sleep.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d Kitsune said, his voice shading a bit sharp. \u201cDo I need to remind you what happened the last time you were out while exhausted?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHitoshi,\u201d Kitsune cheerfully called, the one in question turning almost immediately in response, \u201cyour phone darling?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d he stared incredulously, \u201cplease tell me my brain is wrong and \n\nyou did not just say that\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course sweetheart,\u201d the devil in the form of a brat responded, easily handing over his phone.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI refuse, I \n\nrefuse \n\nto have any knowledge about this. Someone put me into a coma.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThank you honey,\u201d Kitsune said, then a hand raised and grabbed at his mask, lifting it up until it came off and he just blatantly stared at the healers face, \n\n\n\u201cHello? Yamada-san? Oh I\u2019m sorry, \n\nHizashi\n\n, yea I\u2019m calling because Shouta seems to be a bit tired tonight and you know how dangerous that is.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having a fucking fever dream,\u201d he whispered to himself, staring at the face of the boyfriend to the man who he sees as his own son.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course! I\u2019ll send you the location now, have a good night Hizashi.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith a click, Midoriya Izuku ended the phone call he had just made to his husband with a cheeky smirk sent his way. Vaguely he registered Hitoshi pressing the off button for the camera he had installed on his suit but he was too busy having a crisis to fully notice.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell Shouta,\u201d Izuku, the boyfriend of his son, the one they knew as a support industry engineer who partnered with Hatsume from UA, the fucking face behind Kitsune\u2019s mask, chirped, \u201cIts a pleasure to formally meet you in gear but out of mask.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI,\u201d he started, turning his head up to look at the stars that couldn\u2019t be seen past the light pollution anyways, \u201cneed a goddamn vacation.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn the background to his agony, the cackles of the two shits he can\u2019t believe he cares about echoed loudly into the night.\n\n\n\n"
