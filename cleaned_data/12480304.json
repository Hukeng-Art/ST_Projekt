    "notes": "<p>Hello readers!<br>Welcome to this new (slightly major) project of mine. This idea came to me a couple of weeks ago, and I haven't been able to shake it off ever since. I hope you will have as much fun reading it as I have writing it! This is the first part of a series with seven installments, starting with The Philosopher's Stone and ending with The Deathly Hallows. Enjoy Draco's ride on the train of troublesome Gryffindors, and let me hear what you think :D</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This story will, for a large part, crawl along the original storyline by JKR, and you will come across passages that will be familiar as well as quotes from the books. Naturally, I claim no copyright for those. I am just borrowing them to twist the story into a new perspective.</p>\n<p>To the readers of my other ongoing story: I promise I have not forgotten Quidditch Chronicles, and I am still working on the next chapter. Things have been going slow, but please have some more patience with me, and don't hate me for dividing my attention between those two stories ;)</p>\n<p>Edit 02/05/2020: Dear readers, I want to take this moment to remind you that, in my humble opinion, the concept of 'plagiarism' isn't one that usually applies to fanfiction and should not be thrown around easily, for it is hurtful. Fanfiction is work that, in its definition and intention, borrows from source material, and I never pretended to do otherwise. These stories contain quotes of the original works from JKR, and entire paragraphs are fashioned from the source material and spiced up with Draco's POV. I did that intentionally, and I don't consider it to be plagiarism for I was upfront about what I was doing (aka, I never sold them as my words alone), I don't make money from it or get any academic recognition or anything similar with this work, it's merely fanfiction *based* on the very same work. Hundreds, if not thousands of other fanfiction writers on this platform are doing the same thing, borrowing from source material and building up their own, new story from it. I don't require you to like it, I just require you to not attack me if you don't. If you need a reminder about fanfiction protocol and what exactly constructive criticism means, please refer to the chapter endnotes I posted at the end of the sixth installment (https://archiveofourown.org/works/19998850/chapters/54599563). All hurtful comments will be deleted.</p>\n<p>Edit 26/03/2023: Illustrator and graphic designer Crystal designed an amazing book cover for this story! I am so excited!!

Thank you for your amazing response to the prologue! I really hope this first chapter lives up to your expectations and does not disappoint! ;)</p>\n<p>Please don't get used to the fast updates - I have written ahead a little, and this chapter was mostly done when I posted the prologue and just needed some adjustments. For all the following chapters, though, my beta and I might need some more time, so please be patient with us :)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy reading, and please let me know what you think :)</p>\n<p>And I'm back with the second chapter :) Thanks a lot for all your encouraging comments! I realise that currently, the story still flows pretty much parallel to the original, but take my word for it when I promise it will develop a mind of its own the more Draco becomes involved with Harry. For now, I hope you don't mind the tightrope walk between canon and the Draco-inclusive plotline too much!</p>\n<p>Please enjoy Draco's journey on befriending the Gryffindors, and let me know what you think :)</p>\n<p>Thank you all so much for your ongoing support and all your lovely comments! They cheer me up so much through the frustration that is my daily workload for university and give me the motivation I need to push on, and find some time to return to Draco &amp; Harry's adventures in my spare minutes. Love you all!</p>\n<p>Now, onto the new chapter, including Hermione and a Halloween that is a couple of weeks late, but I hope you still enjoy it :) Let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>Hello, my dear readers! Thank you as always for your lovely comments! I hope you will enjoy this chapter as much as the others - befitting the pre-Christmas season, it includes (not-so-festive) Christmas holidays, Lucius and Narcissa. I wish you all a fabulous December :)</p>\n<p>Hello, my dearest readers! Just dropping in to throw out one more chapter before the holidays, and wishing you all a very happy Christmas in advance! Hope you have a wonderful time! Thank you for all the love I always receive from your comments - they make my world a little brighter time and time again :) Now, enough talk. Please enjoy the new chapter!</p>\n<p>Happy New Year, my dear readers! We reached the second last chapter of the first instalment, and therefore, it is time for our golden quartett to make their way down the trapdoor and towards the stone. Large passages of this will be familiar, as always, but I hope Draco's presence will shake things up enough for you to enjoy reading it :)</p>\n<p>We reached the last chapter of this instalment :D I hope you'll enjoy it, and that you'll stick with me for Draco's 2nd year :)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>For updates on this series, I would suggest subscribing to or just watching the Series!

    "text": "Draco was standing in front of the blue fire, his fingers grabbing onto the rolled up parchment in his hand so tightly they were about to cramp up. He was trembling from head to toe, and cold sweat was running down his neck.\nThis was insane. The most deranged thing he had ever done. He must be completely mental. And yet, he knew with total clarity that he was going to do it anyways.\nIt was exactly twenty-four minutes past two a.m.. In six hours and thirty-six minutes, he and his parents would be tried in front of the Wizengamot. The ancient clock hanging over the aged chimney in this old, almost forgotten part of their west wing seemed to be taunting him, counting down the seconds of his freedom. Maybe of his life, if things went badly. Because who said he was going to come out of this alive? The mark on his arm proved his guilt. Not to mention all the things he had done. He had almost killed both Katie Bell and Ron Weasley in his Sixth Year. He had led the Death Eaters into Hogwarts not much later, and it had resulted in Dumbledore\u2019s death. He had tortured and hurt more people than he could count. He still felt sick every time he thought about all the things he had done, and the blood on his hands. He knew that the hateful things the Aurors had whispered at him when they had questioned him were right. He might have been kissed by the end of the day, and he would deserve it.\nBut he was scared. He did not want to die, not now, after he had made it out of this war alive. He and his parents were finally safe, only to have a wand held against their throats all over again. All he wanted was a way out. A way to do it all over again, and to erase his mistakes.\nHe stared at the crackling blue flames so hard they imprinted in his vision.\nHis father had told him about this chimney when he had still been very young. Long before he had even set foot into Hogwarts. He had explained that this fireplace was much more than just a regular entrance point to a Floo Network. That it had been part of this Manor from the days of its construction, and that it held some very ancient magic.\n\u201cYou know about time turners, of course, but this magic was of a different, stronger variety. It was supposed to actually be able to reverse time. To send you back into your past, not just as a bystander, but into your actual body. You could relive those days all over again, or change the past.\u201d\n\u201cSo,\u201d Draco had asked, with big eyes. \u201cIf I make a mistake, I can just hop in and make it right again?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d his father had said immediately, shaking his head with a sudden solemnity to his expression. \u201cIt was broken some centuries ago, and no one ever managed to fix it. Even trying would be the utmost stupidity. There is no way of finding out whether it\u2019s safe or not to use it, because when you return to the past, you will have forgotten your future. Even if you succeed, you will not remember trying to have fixed it.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Draco had frowned. \u201cWhat if you wrote a message to your past self, explaining? What if you-\u201d\n\u201cDraco,\u201d his father had interrupted him with a tone of absolute authority. \u201cMeddling with time is dangerous. If it goes wrong, you will forever be lost in the limbo of it. It is not worth the risk. Do you understand?\u201d\nDraco had nodded, as he had always done when his father had told him what to do. Ever the good boy. Never going against his wishes.\nAnd look where that had brought him.\nDraco gulped, squeezing his fingers around the parchment in his hand.\nThings were different now, though. This might be the last chance he had at making a difference for himself, and for his whole family. If he was likely to have been kissed by this time tomorrow, wasn\u2019t the risk of being stuck in an eternal limbo of time worth taking?\nPlus, he thought, his chances weren\u2019t bad. He had managed to fix the Vanishing Cabinet, after all, and he had spent much more time on this project. All these hours when he had tried escaping from the madness going on in his own home, when he had needed something to do or else he would have gone loony, he had spent here, fiddling with this fireplace. He had read up on the spellwork in long forgotten tombs from hidden corners of their library, and everything looked as it should have. The flames were the exact right shade of blue, for one. Deep azure, not quite cobalt or royal. They weren\u2019t hot to the touch, but they still emanated warmth. It was just like it had been described, and a long way from the scorching, turquoise fire he had started with.\n\u201cIt\u2019s as good as it\u2019s going to get,\u201d he muttered to himself, wincing at how shaky his own voice was.\nThis was his one chance to make things right. His one shot at being a good guy and choosing the winning side, instead of the one his father had pushed onto him.\n\u201cHere goes,\u201d he said. He took a deep, steadying breath, before stepping into the flames. They tickled him through his clothes with their strange, magical heat, and it felt bizarre. \u201cJuly 31st, 1991,\u201d he exclaimed in a clear voice, with only a slight tremble to his words.\nFirst, nothing happened, and Draco thought he had failed. Then, the blue flames rose around him, and just like they were supposed to, they turned white, blinding him and blocking everything else from his view.\n&gt;\n\u00a0\nDraco stumbled out of the chimney, coughing as he collided with the floor in a decidedly non-smooth manner. He blinked, looking around in confusion. What was he doing in the west wing? Had he not been in bed, unable to fall asleep thinking of the upcoming day, just a moment ago?\nDraco watched numbly as the blue flames died down from the chimney, leaving the room in the soft light of the torches on the wall. The ancient clock above the fireplace gonged once, informing him that it was half-past two, in the middle of the night.\n\u201cWhat in Salazar\u2019s name-\u201d Draco muttered, before he took note of the parchment in his hand. He stared down at the way it lay in his hand, rolled up and sealed with the Malfoy emblem.\nHe took another suspicious look around, making sure he was alone, before sitting up and looking at the parchment once more. He broke the seal carefully, unrolling it to reveal a letter, written in green ink and a tidy script that seemed strangely familiar.\n\nDraco,\n\n\nThis will be hard to believe, but I am writing to you from the future. I fixed the fireplace (or better, you will, seven years ahead), and if I succeeded, this message will reach you in the year 1991, at age eleven, shortly before you start at Hogwarts.\n\n\nI returned us to this point in time to ask you to change our future, and save both our parents and us. In the past years, this family has made a lot of wrong choices, and I want you to unmake them for us.\n\n\nBefriend Harry Potter. You will meet him today at Madam Malkin\u2019s, and I want you to make sure you end up on his good side. Don\u2019t insult his friends, even if you feel the need to. Be polite, and in no way condescending. He doesn\u2019t know much about our world, and if you play our cards right, you can be the one to show him the way around. If you blow it, like I did, he will hate you, and the consequences of that will go much farther than you can understand now. Be his friend. You will need him someday.\n\n\nFurthermore - and this is just as important as becoming Harry Potter\u2019s friend - don\u2019t believe everything Father tells you, and don\u2019t make any decisions simply because you wish to please him. The ideals he is pursuing will be the ruin of this family, not only because they are wrong and bigoted, but because it will put you on the wrong side of a crucial conflict. Purebloods are no better than Half-Bloods, or even Muggleborns. Such a thing as \u2018Blood traitors\u2019 does not exist. Do not stick to these false prejudices.\n\n\nThe Dark Side will not be the one who wins. Strive towards the light. Go to Hogwarts, make the right friends and stick to them.\n\n\nI know you won\u2019t want to believe this letter. How would you, if it questions what Father taught you? But I can show you what your future will look like if you don\u2019t listen to me.\n\nHold onto this letter, and say \u2018Ostende mihi\u2019.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want what you will see to happen, be nice to Harry Potter when you meet him today.\n\n\nYours,\n\n\nDraco Malfoy, August 15th, 1998\n\nDraco gaped at the signature and the date next to it, incredulous. \u201cMerlin\u2019s pants,\u201d he whispered. This was a trick, right? Somewhere in the corridor, Theodore Nott was listening in on him and laughing, he was sure of it. But at the same time, he was intrigued, and his eyes returned to the latin just a few paragraphs above.\n\u201cOstende mihi,\u201d he said and gasped when the writing washed from the letter at his words. Everything started spinning, and then, he found himself in the middle of a train compartment. The edges around him were blurry and washed out, but he had no time to focus on his surroundings because, at that moment, he heard himself speak, and whirled around to watch.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter,\u201d he heard himself say to a bespectacled boy with messy black hair. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\u201d\nHe held out his hand for the boy to shake, but the other didn\u2019t take it. Instead, he looked faintly angry.\n\u201cI think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\u201d was all the answer he got, and Draco saw himself flush both in shock and rage.\nThe scenery changed then. Everything started spinning once more, and he found himself standing in a large bathroom. By the sinks, a boy had sunken to the floor, sobbing. The boy had blond hair like his, but he was much older, and he was wearing Slytherin robes. A ghost of a girl was floating over him, making cooing sounds.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d the boy sobbed. \u201cI\u2019m going to fail, and then he will kill my parents. Kill me.\u201d\nThe ghost was saying something, but Draco could not make it out. The room was spinning again, and next, he found himself in a room so spacey that it seemed to have no walls, and which was packed with odd things as far as the eye reached. He found the same boy again, screaming and running from flames that were quickly spreading through the room. Draco had just enough time to recognize the boy. It was him, Draco, years and years in the future. The same Draco that had written him the letter.\nHis own screams still hung in his ears when the scenery changed again, and he found himself in the fresh air, looking up at a burning castle. With a start, he recognized it as Hogwarts.\nWhen he found himself back in the west wing of the manor, he was shaking like a leaf. He dropped the letter and crawled away from it until his back hit the door.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Draco whispered, not sure if he wanted to scream or cry. \u201cNo.\u201d\nThe words of advice written in the letter kept ringing through his head, now in the voice of the older Draco.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want this to happen, be nice to Harry Potter when you meet him today.\n\n\u201cDraco,\u201d his mother said softly, making him look up from where he had been blankly staring at the Filibuster Fireworks on display in Gambol Jabes Joke Shop. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, darling? You\u2019re so absent-minded today. You haven\u2019t even talked our ears off about getting you a broom.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t encourage him, Narcissa,\u201d his father drawled, a slow smile on his face. \u201cI was quite enjoying the silence.\u201d\nHis mother rolled her blue eyes at her husband\u2019s input, but she was smiling at Draco expectantly.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Draco said, a little too quickly. \u201cI was just thinking.\u201d\n\u201cDangerous pastime, son,\u201d his father said, only half-joking. \u201cEvery time you think, you get ridiculous ideas, and I have to take time out of my day to answer your myriad of questions. Now, off you go to get your school robes, we don\u2019t have all day! I will just drop in with Flourish and Blotts to check if they have that new volume I\u2019ve been looking for. I will pick you up when I\u2019m done.\u201d\nWith that, his father turned in a flurry of robes, striding off towards the bookshop further down the street. Draco looked back up at his mother, to find that she was still watching him quizzically.\n\u201cNow that your father is gone,\u201d she told him with a secret smile. \u201cWhat is it that\u2019s on your mind, dear?\u201d\nDraco gulped, shifting on his feet. All his instincts told him to tell his parents about the letter he had received last night, but the words of what was supposedly his future self made him hesitant. If the writer of the letter was right, then his father\u2019s opinion was not to be trusted - but how could he find out if the writer of the letter was to be trusted, without asking for the opinion of his parents?\n\u201cIf you received a letter from someone claiming to be your future self,\u201d Draco blurted out finally, meeting his mother\u2019s eyes. \u201cWould you believe it?\u201d\nHis mother rose her eyebrows at him, looking amused.\n\u201cHave you been up last night reading those novels again, Draco?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cMight have,\u201d Draco shrugged, figuring it was as good an excuse as any. \u201cBut I was just wondering how realistic it is. How can you know the letter is not a trick? Anyone could have written it, couldn\u2019t they?\u201d\nHis mother hummed thoughtfully.\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d she said finally, frowning. \u201cIt would depend on the content of the letter, and if the things the letter predicts really end up happening.\u201d\n\u201cIn the book, memories were attached to the letter,\u201d Draco muttered, his heart hammering inside his chest. \u201cOf their past, or, in other words, the character\u2019s future. Can things like these be faked?\u201d\n\u201cOf course they can,\u201d Narcissa conceded. \u201cBut it takes impressive magical skills to do it convincingly. And, of course, someone would need a motive to go to such lengths.\u201d\nDraco gulped. That excluded Theodore Nott, in the very least. But really, who would want Draco to rebel against his parents, and to befriend Harry Potter? All grown wizards Draco knew were acquaintances of his parents, and they all shared their family\u2019s ideals. None of them would benefit from Draco being led to doubt what he had been taught.\n\u201cYou should go get yourself fitted into your new robes, darling,\u201d his mother\u2019s voice broke through his thoughts again. \u201cBe sure to get a new set of dress robes, too. You\u2019ve outgrown yours. Can you go by yourself? I\u2019d like to have a look at Ollivanders in the meantime.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Draco nodded, sending her what he hoped was a reassuring smile. \u201cLeave it to me, Mother.\u201d\nHis mother squeezed his shoulder once, and then, she too left to stroll further down the street. Draco watched her disappear into the crowd before he turned hesitantly to look at Madam Malkin\u2019s Robes For All Occasions.\nHis mother had suggested finding out whether the predictions of the letter came true, Draco reminded himself. That meant if Harry Potter really turned up at Madam Malkin\u2019s while Draco was there, the chances that the letter was real were pretty high. Because, really, who did he know that could foresee when both Draco and the famous Harry Potter, who\u2019d been kept from the Wizarding World for ten years, would enter the same Robe Shop? No one could manipulate that, could they?\nSteeling himself, Draco entered the shop and suffered through the fussing of the plump owner and her handsy assistant. Nervously, he kept glancing at the door as his oversized robes were pinned to the right length, waiting for the door to open.\nWhen it finally did, Draco almost tumbled down the stool he was standing on. Because in came the same boy with messy dark hair that he had seen in the memory the letter had shown him. He wore ridiculously big and dingy Muggle clothes Draco would have turned his nose up at under normal circumstances, and outrageously old-fashioned glasses, which seemed to be held together by some cheap kind of Spello-tape. The boy seemed intimidated, looking into the shop with the air of someone unsure whether they ought to be there before Madam Malkin rounded in on him.\n\u201cHogwarts, dear?\u201d she asked, and the boy nodded hastily. \u201cGot the lot here - another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\u201d She shooed him over to where Draco was standing on his chair, conjuring a similar one for the other boy to stand on and pulled a robe over his head to begin her work.\nDraco fingers were trembling slightly as he worked up the nerve to speak.\n\u201cHullo,\u201d he said, trying to seem unaffected. \u201cHogwarts, too?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the boy, looking over at him, rather shyly.\n\u201cI\u2019m Draco,\u201d Draco introduced himself. \u201cDraco Malfoy.\u201d\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d the boy answered with a tentative smile.\nThe effects of these words were immediate: Draco\u2019s breath came out in a gasp as the shop assistant pushed a pin into his side in shock, and Madam Malkin made a noise that sounded like a Kneazle that had its tail stepped on, staring up at the boy in front of her in shock. Harry Potter himself, though, seemed rather alarmed at that reaction, and he flushed uncomfortably.\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Draco said, at last, forcing himself to smile in a way that would seem friendly, but not too eager so that he wouldn\u2019t come around like an excited fan. The last thing he needed was for Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, to think he was a loser. \u201cIs this your first time to Diagon Alley?\u201d\n\u201cIt is, actually,\u201d Harry answered, seeming thankful for the conversation to turn away from his name. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here before?\u201d\n\u201cLoads of times,\u201d Draco shrugged, automatically adapting a tone of superiority before he stopped himself. Be polite, and in no way condescending, the letter had said. \u201cI mean,\u201d Draco added hastily, his voice rather small. \u201cMy parents take me along on their shopping every once in a while.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d Harry nodded, shifting on his feet, seeming nervous again. \u201cSo your parents are wizards, too?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Draco confirmed immediately. \u201cThe Malfoy\u2019s are one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.\u201d The moment the words were out, he wanted to kick himself. No talk about his Pureblood status, the letter had warned. What the heck was he doing?!\n\u201cThe what?\u201d Harry asked, looking rather lost.\n\u201cNevermind\u201d Draco shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not important. What I mean is, yes, they are wizards.\u201d\n\u201cYou must know all about magic already, then,\u201d Harry said, looking rather miserable.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, dear,\u201d Madam Malkin injected kindly, throwing Draco a disapproving look. \u201cThere will be lots of students from Muggle families, and even the most pure-blooded wizards need to go to school to learn.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Draco said quickly. \u201cYou\u2019ll pick everything up quickly, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\u201cSo it doesn\u2019t make any difference?\u201d Harry checked, his voice quiet as he met Draco\u2019s eyes with rather bright green ones behind his shabby glasses. \u201cHaving grown up in a Muggle family?\u201d\nDraco\u2019s heart beat fast as he held Harry\u2019s gaze.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he answered, with determination. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nHarry smiled at that, seeming relieved.\n\u201cGood,\u201d he nodded.\n\u201cAnd if you have any questions, you can always ask me,\u201d Draco offered. \u201cI can help you find your way around.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry replied, his smile widening. \u201cIt will be nice, knowing someone before getting to school. I\u2019m usually alone everywhere.\u201d He clasped his mouth shut as if thinking he had said too much.\n\u201cWell, you won\u2019t be at Hogwarts,\u201d Draco promised. He gulped down the part about how everyone was going to want to be his friend the moment they had heard his name and continued instead: \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll end up in the same house, even!\u201d\n\u201cThe same house?\u201d Harry asked curiously, and Draco was going to answer when Madam Malkin said: \u201cThat\u2019s you done, my dear,\u201d and removed the finished robes from Harry\u2019s shoulders. As Harry got down from his chair, he spotted a giant of a man through the window holding two cones of ice cream, and Harry waved at him happily.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d Harry said, turning to him. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at Hogwarts then, Draco!\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco nodded, smiling back at him. \u201cSee you!\u201d\nDraco watched Harry as he paid for his robes at the counter and made his way out of the shop. The huge, bearded man pressed the ice cream into his hand, and they took off down the street, chatting happily. Draco wished he could follow, and cursed the dress robes his mother had asked him to get.\nBut all in all, this had gone well, he decided. Harry had seemed pleased to meet him, and Draco had not insulted any of his friends. At least not that he realised. Yes, he would have to work on keeping his mouth shut about being a pureblood, but old habits died hard, so he didn\u2019t think he could be blamed for his slip. Important was that he had met Harry Potter at Madam Malkin\u2019s, the way the letter had predicted, and the boy had not ended up hating him.\nHe could work his way towards the rest.\n\u00a0\nDraco decided not to tell his parents about meeting Harry Potter. While he thought that they would not exactly disapprove of his attempt at befriending the famous boy (his father always went on and on about how important connections and public esteem were), he figured it would be best to keep his ambitions to himself, out of fear of being influenced in a way that would end up ruining his chances at success.\nIn the long weeks of August, he\u2019d had a lot of time to consider the letter and its contents. He was fairly certain of its authenticity after meeting Harry for himself, and the implications of that had left his mind spinning for days after. Draco had been raised with firm beliefs of the superiority of his blood and status, and now, with one letter, all that seemed to be crashing down around him, and he did not quite know what to do with himself. If he was not Draco Malfoy, heir of the Malfoy family and member of the pureblood aristocracy, who was he? He spent days and days in the library of the Manor, reading essays on the topic that he never fully understood and that left him more confused than before. He mulled over his questions at night, restlessly wondering if he was really willing to throw the belief in his heritage away for a dubious letter from the future.\nBut then he remembered the memories he'd seen and the general feeling of desperation that had emanated from them. He was unsure what exactly they meant, and what the future Draco had been through entailed, but he knew that none of it was good and that he did not want it to happen to him.\nAnd if that meant befriending Harry Potter and turning his back on what he had been taught, maybe, it was worth it, in the end.\nWhen September First finally approached, Draco became all the more restless. What if Harry decided he did not like him once he got to know him better? Draco had never had to befriend anyone without the help of his family name or the connections of his parents before. All kids he had ever hung out with were children of the acquaintances of his father, and even among them, he was unsure who to call a friend. Crabbe and Goyle would be the closest thing, but that was only because they were too dumb to contradict him and just followed along. Others, like Theodore Nott, were the bane of his existence rather than what he would call \u201cfriends\u201d. What exactly did one have to do to make friends? Not insulting people Harry liked and not boasting over his blood status would only get Draco this far. What did you talk about with someone you barely knew, and who had grown up in a world different from your own?\n\u201cAre you sure you have everything?,\u201d his mother asked as she levitated his trunk down the stairs towards the entrance hall, looking at him inquiringly. \u201cRobes? Books? Potions supplies? Quill and parchment?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Mother,\u201d Draco rolled his eyes, carefully carrying the cage containing his beloved eagle owl down behind her. \u201cYou were there when the elves packed it. You know everything is there.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt to check twice,\u201d his mother shrugged, setting down the trunk at the foot of the stairs the same moment his father entered the entrance hall.\n\u201cReady, Draco? \u201d he asked, in unusually high spirits. In the last couple of days, Draco had gotten the impression that his father was just as excited for him to start school as Draco himself, if not more. He had gone on and on about the classes and the teachers, the Slytherin house and the extracurricular activities he wanted him to consider. Draco took those bits of advice as what they were: the pressure of great expectations, and the demand to come home with results befitting of the Malfoy name. The thought left a sour taste in Draco\u2019s mouth. \u201cOur portkey leaves in exactly one minute. \u201d He held up an antique silver goblet demonstratively with one hand and summoned Draco\u2019s trunk with his other. His mother smiled at Draco as she put a hand on his shoulder, squeezing it as they joined his father.\nLucius Malfoy was already counting down the seconds, his eyes on his wristwatch, and Draco held onto the cage under his arm tightly as he touched a finger to the goblet, right next to where his mother\u2019s rested. As his father\u2019s count reached zero, the world started spinning, and Draco closed his eyes, focusing on holding himself upright. When his feet touched the ground again, they had arrived at the apparition point near King\u2019s Cross.\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d his father announced cheerfully, pocketing the goblet and pulling Draco\u2019s trunk behind himself as he set off towards the entrance of the station. Draco hastened to follow him, sending nervous looks to the Muggles nearby who frowned at their robes and his owl. Aquila let out an indignant sound as if he too condoned the judging looks.\nAs they neared the alcove between platforms nine and ten, Draco\u2019s mother explained in a hushed voice which barrier he needed to pass to get to the magical platform, and Draco observed carefully as his father went ahead and disappeared from sight, before doing his best to copy him.\nPlatform nine and three quarters was busy when he appeared, bustling with wizards and witches and cats and owls, and Draco immediately stretched his neck trying to spot Harry.\n\u201cLook, there are Linda and Gregory,\u201d his mother pointed out the Goyle Family, misinterpreting his searching gaze, and Draco resigned himself of a long while of watching their parents do the talking while receiving only one-syllable answers from the burly boy with him.\nAll in all, he was glad when they could excuse themselves to the train after the arrival of the Crabbe\u2019s, under the pretence of wanting to capture the best available seats. His mother fussed over him some more in parting, reminding him to write regularly, work hard and stay out of trouble, and then, they were finally free to explore the train.\nIn his search for Harry, Draco chased Crabbe and Goyle down two wagons of mostly free seats before they started to complain, and finally settled in an empty compartment. Draco took the window seat and watched the passing wizards closely, hoping to spot the messy-haired, bespectacled boy, but when the train finally took off, he had still not found him.\n\u201cDo you think there is any food here?,\u201d Crabbe grunted, the first full sentence he had spoken that day.\n\u201cI think there is a trolley coming through at some point, selling sweets,\u201d Draco drawled, waving absentmindedly at his mother as they sped away. \u201cShall we go look for it?,\u201d he suggested, jumping at the excuse to investigate the train some more.\n\u201cBut we just sat down,\u201d Goyle complained moodily, though when Draco sent him an annoyed look, he closed his mouth and got to his feet.\nIt took them ages to get from one side of the train to the other, and then, still not having found Harry, they had to go all the way back again, towards the other side. They passed the trolley twice on their way, but Draco ignored Crabbe and Goyle\u2019s complaints as he pushed on, searching. At last, Draco spotted Harry in a compartment right towards the end, excitedly chatting with a red-headed boy, empty and half-eaten containers of Chocolate Frogs, Bertie Botts Beans and other sweets all over the place.\nWhen Draco pushed the door open, Harry looked up and smiled brightly at him.\n\u201cDraco!,\u201d he called. \u201cI wondered when I would meet you!\u201d\n\u201cHello, Harry,\u201d Draco returned, a relieved grin spreading over his face. He looked over to the red-headed boy, noting that suspicious blue eyes were looking him up and down. Draco took a short moment to take inventory of the shade of his hair and the shabby clothes, immediately identifying as a member of the Weasley family his father had ranted on about so often. His heart sank a bit.\n\u201cOh, this is Ron,\u201d Harry introduced him cheerfully, following Draco\u2019s gaze. \u201cRon, this is Draco. I met him in Diagon Alley a couple of weeks ago.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d the boy said slowly, nodding his head in greeting. \u201cRon Weasley. Nice to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cDraco Malfoy,\u201d Draco answered, noting the Weasley boy\u2019s eyes narrowing just so slightly at hearing his last name. \u201cPleasure.\u201d Then, only just remembering they were there, he waved to the boys behind him. \u201cThis is Crabbe and Goyle.\u201d The two of them grunted, in apparent confusion as to why they were even there, talking to these people.\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m Harry Potter,\u201d Harry introduced himself, and Draco did not need to turn to know their eyes had grown the size of saucers at those words. There was a stunned silence. Harry met Draco\u2019s eyes, looking unsure.\n\u201cYou want to sit down? \u201d he offered, gathering some of the wrappers and pushing them hastily off the seat next to him. Draco ignored the mess and took the seat. He saw Weasley exchange cautious looks with Crabbe and Goyle as they remained standing.\n\u201cRon was just telling me about Quidditch,\u201d Harry said conversationally, and Draco frowned.\n\u201cYou play?,\u201d he asked Weasley, trying to keep his voice even and free of judgement.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Weasley shrugged, somewhat defiantly. \u201cSince I\u2019ve been young, with my brothers. Charlie was Gryffindor\u2019s Seeker before he graduated, and Fred and George are Beaters on the team.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d Draco nodded. \u201cI wished First Year\u2019s could own a broom and try out, too,\u201d he huffed.\n\u201cI know!,\u201d Weasley agreed in frustration, apparently momentarily forgetting his suspicion of Draco. \u201cIt\u2019s so unfair! Who is to say we aren\u2019t good enough?!\u201d\n\u201cExactly!,\u201d Draco stressed. \u201cI\u2019ve been flying since I could walk! That\u2019s more than some Seventh Year who never touched a broom before coming to Hogwarts can say!\u201d He remembered Harry\u2019s background at this point, and added quickly: \u201cI mean, not that that\u2019s a bad thing\u2026\u201d He turned to Harry, trying to smile reassuringly, and Harry smiled back, making it worth his effort.\nDraco noted Crabbe and Goyle exchanging startled looks.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he asked, turning to Weasley in an attempt to keep the conversation going. \u201cDo you follow the league? Which is your favourite team?\u201d\n\u201cThe Chudley Cannons,\u201d Weasley answered proudly. \u201cYou?\u201d\n\u201cMy family has season tickets to the Falcons,\u201d Draco shrugged. \u201cA little sad I can\u2019t go anymore, but then again, we can watch the house championship.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Weasley frowned, his eyes narrowing. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll be in Slytherin?,\u201d he prodded, an edge to his voice.\n\u201cWell, my whole family was in Slytherin, so I would think so,\u201d Draco said casually, and saw Weasley exchange a meaningful look with Harry. \u201cWhat? \u201d he demanded, a little defensively. \u201cIs there a problem with that?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry protested, too quickly, shaking his head. \u201cNot at all. We were just talking about houses earlier, and how I\u2019ll probably end up in Hufflepuff because I know nothing.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be a Hufflepuff,\u201d Draco frowned, scandalised. \u201cKnowledge of the Wizarding World doesn\u2019t decide over which house you end up in. It\u2019s the character that counts.\u201d\n\u201cI told him that, too,\u201d Weasley nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d\nCrabbe cleared his throat, and Draco looked up, once again having forgotten their presence.\n\u201cShould we go and meet Nott? \u201d Crabbe asked. \u201cWe passed his compartment earlier.\u201d\n\u201cYou can go, if you want,\u201d Draco drawled. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here.\u201d The two boys exchanged reluctant looks at that. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Draco repeated. \u201cI\u2019ll catch up with you.\u201d\nFinally, the two of them shrugged and turned to leave. Silence fell upon their compartment as the door fell closed behind them.\n\u201cIs it okay, not to go with your friends?\" Harry asked.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call them \u2018friends\u2019,\u201d Draco shrugged. \u201cThey are the sons of Father\u2019s acquaintances. I\u2019ve just known them for a long time.\u201d\n\u201cYour father is Lucius Malfoy, right?\u201d Weasley asked suddenly.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco answered, uncomfortable with the subject. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Weasley shrugged, but his tone indicated that it wasn\u2019t \u2018nothing\u2019 at all. Draco\u2019s instinct was to call him out on it, but he was pretty sure that nothing Ron Weasley would have to say about his father could be positive, and he did not want Harry to hear any of it if he could help it.\nSo he turned to Harry and started babbling about what he had heard about their classes and teachers, and Harry seemed eager to listen. Weasley joined in reluctantly, and their conversation went on until a bossy, bushy-haired girl pushed open the door to announce they would arrive soon and to tell Harry and Weasley to change into their robes.\nDraco then returned to his own compartment to collect his things, only to find that Theodore Nott had settled with Crabbe and Goyle, apparently having a blast. He was talking animatedly as Draco pushed the door open, and when he turned to look at him, his smirk widening.\n\u201cMalfoy!,\u201d he called. \u201cI heard you made friends with the youngest Weasley boy!\u201d He snickered, and Crabbe and Goyle shifted nervously.\n\u201cJust for your information,\u201d Draco sneered, stepping into the compartment and letting the door fall closed behind him. \u201cI was there because of Harry Potter. Because, unlike you, I strive to make the most useful and influential friends I can while at Hogwarts.\u201d\nNott snorted, and Draco stretched to pick up his sleeping owl, quite satisfied with himself.\n\u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d be careful not to be seen with blood traitors and the like,\u201d Nott scoffed. \u201cI\u2019m sure your father wouldn\u2019t be pleased.\u201d\n\u201cLet that be my worry,\u201d Draco sniffed. He held onto the wall as the train started to slow down, keeping his balance just so. Aquila unstuck his head from under his wing, looking at Draco indignantly. \u201cWe seem to be here,\u201d Draco announced, looking at Crabbe and Goyle. \u201cYou coming?\u201d\nThe boys exchanged startled looks before looking at Nott for instruction. Draco frowned.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and catch up with your best pal, Weasley,\u201d Nott smirked. \u201cWe will be nearby. Laughing.\u201d\nDraco sneered at him, clinging to the cage in his hands.\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d he huffed. \u201cNot like I care what you do.\u201d\nAnd with that, he turned and left the compartment, off to find Harry.\n\u00a0\nThe Hogwarts castle was stunning, even for someone who had grown up in a Manor and was used to magic. Still, Draco found himself watching Harry almost as much as he was taking in his new school. The expression of utter fascination on Harry\u2019s face brought him inexplicable joy. All his life, his father had gone on and on about his view that children from non-magical backgrounds should never be admitted. That they would never understand their traditions and way of life, and that they were a danger to the Wizarding community at large. But seeing Harry\u2019s innocent enthusiasm, he could not relate to his father\u2019s words at all. What harm could someone like Harry possibly bring to anyone?\nAfter they had crossed the lake with Hagrid, the gamekeeper and the very same giant of a man Draco had seen Harry with at Diagon Alley, the doors to the castle opened, and they were given into the care of Professor McGonagall, who Draco knew was Deputy Headmistress and Head of Gryffindor House. His father had warned him never to cross her, since she was apparently a very strict woman who was not to be tampered with, and meeting her for himself, Draco could immediately tell that he had been right in that aspect.\n\u201cThe firs'-years, Professor McGonagall,\u201d Hagrid said importantly, gesturing to the lot of them at large.\n\u201cThank you, Hagrid,\u201d she returned cordially. \u201cI will take them from here.\u201d\nAnd with that, she led them into the huge entrance hall, past the doors to the famous Great Hall and into a small side room.\n\u201cWelcome to Hogwarts!,\u201d she called, when they had all filed in. \u201cThe start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.\u201d\nAs Professor McGonagall went on to introduce the four houses, Draco sneaked a look at Harry, who was listening to the teacher with full attention. He hoped, with all his might, that Harry would end up in Slytherin with him. For a moment, he let himself dream of sharing a dormitory with him and sitting in the common room every evening playing chess or just talking. Making fun of Nott together.\n\u201cI hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours,\u201d Professor McGonagall finished, and Draco snapped back to attention. \u201cThe Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\u201d Her eyes travelled over Longbottom and Weasley, and Draco had to suppress a smile. He noted Harry desperately trying to flatten his messy hair next to him as Professor McGonagall told them to wait for her return, and left.\n\u201cHow exactly do they sort us into houses?\u201d Harry asked both Draco and Weasley the moment she had closed the door behind herself.\n\u201cSome sort of test, I think,\u201d Weasley answered with a frown. \u201cFred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come off it,\u201d Draco rolled his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no test. Father said some kind of old magical artefact decided over it, in lieu of the four founders.\u201d\nWeasley seemed irked at being contradicted, but Harry relaxed slightly.\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t have to do any magic?,\u201d he checked with Draco.\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Draco reassured him. \u201cImagine a bunch of First Years attempting to cast spells without instruction and blowing up the Great Hall! No, I don\u2019t think we have to do anything.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Harry nodded, taking a deep breath. \u201cGood.\u201d\nThen, they were all distracted by the unexpected entrance of the school ghosts, which made several people scream, and Draco clasp at Harry\u2019s elbow in shock, though he felt incredibly stupid at his overreaction. He was thankful when Professor McGonagall returned and ordered them to form a line and follow her outside. Harry ended up behind him, with Weasley in his shadow, and the bushy-haired girl they had met in the train in front of Draco. The girl was muttering to herself furiously, and Draco eyed her warily.\nAs they entered the Great Hall, though, Draco was momentarily distracted. The Malfoy Manor was grand, of course, but no room in there could compare to what he saw here. The ceiling was spelled invisible, showing the bright starlit sky outside, and Draco couldn\u2019t help but stare at it in awe.\n\u201cIt\u2019s bewitched to look like the sky outside, I read about it in Hogwarts: A History,\u201d the girl in front of him explained importantly as they passed down four long tables - the house tables, Draco supposed - and the other students were looking at them curiously, making Draco walk a little straighter.\nThey came to a stop in front of the teacher\u2019s table, and Professor McGonagall put down a stool in front of them, on which she gently placed an old, battered hat. Draco made a face at the state of it, hoping they didn\u2019t have to touch it.\nSilence fell upon the hall, and then, to his surprise, the hat opened a ridge-like mouth and started singing.\n\u201cOh, you may not think I\u2019m pretty,\n\nBut don\u2019t judge on what you see,\n\n\nI\u2019ll eat myself if you can find\n\n\nA smarter hat than me.\n\n\nYou can keep your bowlers black,\n\n\nYour top hats sleek and tall,\n\n\nFor I\u2019m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\n\n\nAnd I can cap them all.\n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing hidden in your head\n\n\nThe Sorting Hat can\u2019t see,\n\n\nSo try me on and I will tell you\n\n\nWhere you ought to be.\u201d\n\nDraco smirked, turning to Harry to point out that he had been right and they just had to try on a hat, but his voice died in his throat as he saw the focused look in the other boy\u2019s face. He looked at the sparkle in those green eyes for a moment longer, before focusing back on the scene in front of him.\n\u201cSo put me on! Don\u2019t be afraid!\n\nAnd don\u2019t get in a flap!\n\n\nYou\u2019re in safe hands (though I have none)\n\n\nFor I\u2019m a Thinking Cap!\u201d\n\nThe hall burst into applause, and Draco joined in, grinning as Weasley muttered to Harry: \u201cI\u2019ll kill Fred! He was going on about wrestling a troll!\u201d Draco suppressed a comment about how it probably wasn\u2019t hard to fool Weasley. He couldn\u2019t blame his brother. He was practically asking for it.\nProfessor McGonagall then stepped forwards, a roll of parchment in her hand, and began to call out names. One by one, the students went up, sat on the stool and let her lower the hat onto their heads. After varying intervals, the hat called out their house, and they went to sit at their respective tables under loud cheers.\nDraco noted that Harry looked practically green in the face the more people were called forwards, and he touched his fingers to his elbow, making the other boy look over to him nervously.\n\u201cIt will be alright,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry.\u201d\nHarry tried to smile at him, but it came out as a grimace.\n\u201cGranger, Hermione,\u201d Professor McGonagall called, and Draco noted the strange girl next to him storming towards the stool in an overly eager manner.\n\u201cGryffindor!,\u201d shouted the hat. Weasley groaned. Draco smiled. At least he did not have to deal with that one all that much.\nIt wasn\u2019t long then, until Professor McGonagall called his name. Draco took a deep breath, straightened himself and tried to seem unaffected as he walked over to the stool and sat down. He closed his eyes as the hat was lowered onto his head, and immediately, it shouted: \u201cSlytherin!\u201d\nDraco smiled as he got to his feet. He tried to catch Harry\u2019s eyes in encouragement, but the other boy was frowning, looking slightly unhappy.\nHis housemates were cheering as he took his seat at the Slytherin table, but Draco immediately craned his neck for Harry, nervously waiting for Harry to be called forward. When he was, murmurs broke out over the whole hall, but Draco ignored them as he bit his lip, wishing with all his might that Harry would join him at the Slytherin table.\nThe Sorting Hat took his time with Harry, and Draco saw the other boy clasp his hands around the edges of the stool. He wished he could see his face, but the hat was so big it was covering it almost entirely. Finally, the hat called: \u201cGryffindor!\u201d\nDraco\u2019s heart sank. He felt numb as he watched Harry cross the room to take a seat at the Gryffindor table, accompanied by spectacular cheers of his housemates. He could even hear some people chant: \u201cWe got Potter! We got Potter!\u201d A red-headed boy was shaking Harry\u2019s hand enthusiastically, and Draco wondered, quite miserably, if he was related to Weasley.\n\u201cWish you\u2019d been chosen for Gryffindor now, do you, Malfoy?,\u201d Nott scoffed, smirking, but Draco did not dignify him with an answer. He was too busy trying to hide his disappointment.\n\u00a0\nAfter the last students had been sorted into their houses and Weasley had joined Harry in Gryffindor, the feast began, and after that, the Headmaster Albus Dumbledore stood to give some notices, but Draco found it hard to focus on any of it. The other First Years in his house seemed to have gathered around Nott, including Crabbe and Goyle, and Draco found himself alone among the masses. He kept throwing longing glances over to where Harry was sitting with Weasley, chatting enthusiastically, and cursed the unfairness of the situation. He had met Harry first! It should be Draco next to him and not some dim-witted Weasley! Even worse, despite how hard Draco had tried being polite to the boy, it was very clear that Weasley disliked Draco. Who knew what he would tell Harry about his family? Draco was sure that Weasley would try everything he could to prevent Draco from befriending Harry, and with them being in separate houses, Draco was in clear disadvantage. Weasley would get to share his dormitory, meals, classes and common room, and Draco would be lucky if he got to talk to Harry for a moment in the corridors. How would he manage to grow close to him that way?\nThe thought despaired Draco not just because of the letter, but because he found he honestly liked Harry. He\u2019d never felt the particular need to befriend another person before, but he really wanted to be Harry\u2019s friend. And after spending time with him, the people he usually spent time with felt like a poor consolation prize.\nWhen the feast ended, the Prefects led them down to their quarters in the dungeons. Nott was chatting excitedly as they settled into their dormitory (though no one really answered him - Blaise Zabini was a quiet sort of fellow, and Crabbe and Goyle had gone back to their usual, eloquent way of communication - one-syllable grunts), and Draco felt frustrated and terribly alone as he threw himself onto his bed, staring up at canopy of his four-poster bed.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to cry about not being sorted into Gryffindor, Malfoy, please draw the curtains first,\u201d Nott snickered. \u201cI\u2019d hate to watch such a pathetic sight.\u201d\nDraco showed him the middle-finger and drew his curtains anyway, keen for some privacy. As he heard Nott laugh, he pressed his eyes closed, urging himself not to prove the git right in his statement.\nDraco\u2019s first week at Hogwarts was, frankly speaking, hell.\nFor one, Draco barely had an opportunity to speak to Harry at all. He caught him once, towards the evening of their first day of classes, but they weren\u2019t able to exchange more than a couple of words, and Weasley was with them, still watching Draco like he expected him to attack Harry at any moment. The days after, he only ever saw Harry from afar, and the bright smiles and waves the other boy sent him were barely any consolation for his dull mood.\nIn addition, Theodore Nott had spread amongst all their housemates, First Years and above, that Draco Malfoy had made friends with blood traitors. The consequence of that was complete expulsion from all social circles within Slytherin house, as well as dirty looks following him everywhere, and scornful whispers behind his back.\nBut Nott did not stop there. Apparently not satisfied unless he felt Draco had been thoroughly humiliated, he put an extra effort into making his life difficult. His third day at Hogwarts, Draco woke up to a bucket of ice-cold water being poured right into his face.\n\u201cMaybe like this, we can wash off the mud Weasley and Potter left on you,\u201d Nott had snickered. \u201cBut I suppose it\u2019s a lost cause.\u201d\nThe day after, Draco had come back to his dormitory to find the homework he had done the night before lying on the pillow of his bed, drenched with ink. That night, Draco had stayed up to redo all of it and had slept the remaining few hours in an ink-stained bed.\nOn Friday, the morning of their first potions lesson, he found all his school robes torn, the Slytherin emblem cut from them and his green-silver ties chopped into stripes.\n\u201cNow you can get proper Gryffindor robes like you want to,\u201d Nott taunted and left the room, Crabbe and Goyle following after him dutifully.\nDraco stared at the scraps of his clothes mutely, ordering himself not to cry. He tried desperately to patch them up before class, skipping breakfast, but he didn\u2019t know enough magic to do it, so it was a hopeless endeavour. In the end, he was forced to venture out of the common room in only shirt and trousers.\nThankfully, the Potions classroom was down in the dungeons and therefore not far from their common room, but it was the only class the Slytherins shared with the Gryffindors, meaning Harry would be present. And Harry was the last person Draco wanted to be humiliated in front of, but his other choice was skipping class, which was not an option. So he dragged himself through the dungeons with hung shoulders, and when he finally reached the group of his waiting classmates, he felt like he was going to be sick.\n\u201cDraco!,\u201d Harry called happily, waving Draco over, before blinking, taking in his clothes. \u201cWhy are you not wearing your robes? \u201d he asked in confusion.\nDraco made a face and offered an awkward shrug.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get points taken from your house! \u201d the bushy-haired girl, Granger, threw in sternly as she appeared next to Harry.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Nott mock-gasped from across the corridor, and a hush went through the group of blabbering students until everyone was watching the scene. \u201cYou\u2019d better lend him some robes, Potter. He has no Slytherin pride as it is. Why don\u2019t you adopt him and save us the troubles of having to look at his face day by day?\u201d\n\u201cShut it, Nott!,\u201d Draco hissed, flushing darkly and cursing his life. \u201cYou\u2019re pathetic!\u201d\n\u201cSays the one who associates with blood traitors,\u201d Nott snorted.\n\u201cWhat did you just call us?!,\u201d Weasley snarled, colour rising rapidly in his face. Harry was just staring at Nott in disgust, though it was clear that he had not understood his insult.\n\u201cIgnore him,\u201d Draco bit out, in the same moment that Professor Snape opened the door to the classroom, his eyes narrowing immediately as he took in the scene in front of him.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? \u201d he demanded, an expression of displeasure on his face. \u201cMr Malfoy, why are you not properly dressed?\u201d\nDraco shifted under the sharp gaze of his head of house, lowering his eyes to the floor in embarrassment.\n\u201cI got something on them,\u201d he lied, and Nott snickered in the background.\n\u201cAll of them?,\u201d the Professor prodded, eyes narrowing further. \u201cYour ties, too?\u201d\nDraco shrugged, not knowing how to answer. He could feel Harry\u2019s eyes on him. There was a short pause before Snape said evenly: \u201cOne point from Slytherin. And you\u2019d better take care of this, Mr Malfoy, before I have to deduct more.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d Draco nodded miserably, and then followed his classmates as they filed into the room.\nHe was resigned to finding an empty table to sit by himself again, the way he had been forced to do throughout all of his classes, but before he could, a firm hand had closed around his elbow and dragged him into an empty seat. He looked up into Harry\u2019s grim face.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll sit with me,\u201d he announced firmly, only stopping a moment to throw an apologetic look at Weasley over his shoulder. The redhead shrugged and took the free seat next to Neville Longbottom at the table right behind them, looking resigned.\n\u201cWhat did Nott do to your robes?\u201d Harry hissed under his breath, his startling green eyes zooming in on him behind those ridiculous glasses.\n\u201cLater,\u201d Draco muttered, busily withdrawing his potions book, some parchment and a quill. Harry copied him, a frown on his face.\nProfessor Snape started taking their names, then. When he reached Harry\u2019s name, he paused for a moment, his lip curling unpleasantly.\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d he drawled. \u201cOur new celebrity.\u201d\nNott snickered from across the room, and most of the Slytherins joined him. Draco frowned. When the Professor finally looked up at the class, they all fell silent.\n\u201cYou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making,\u201d Snape began. \u201cAs there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death \u2014 if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\u201d\nExcitement surged through Draco at those words. Potions had been one of the classes he had been looking forward to most - not only was he intrigued by the idea of creating things with his own hands, but his father had spoken of Snape in high tones. Though, Draco added in an afterthought, it appeared that his father\u2019s judgement was to be doubted, meaning he had to be careful there.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Snape said suddenly, and Draco blinked, looking at the boy next to him, who seemed equally as confused. \u201cWhat would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\u201d\nHarry gaped, looking at Draco for help. Draco shrugged his shoulders, equally as clueless. At the table in front of them, Granger had raised her hand in excitement.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Sir,\u201d Harry answered finally.\n\u201cTut tut,\u201d Snape sneered, and Draco\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cFame clearly isn\u2019t everything.\u201d Ignoring Granger completely, he continued: \u201cLet\u2019s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find a bezoar?\u201d\nWhile Granger stretched in her seat, desperate to be called on, Draco just stared at Snape in a mix between confusion and creeping dislike. Nott, Crabbe and Goyle had difficulties stifling their laughter now, and Harry had flushed ever so slightly.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Sir,\u201d he replied again.\n\u201cThought you wouldn\u2019t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\" Snape sneered, and Draco\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief. What was he on about?! He couldn\u2019t have expected any of them to learn their textbooks by heart before even starting school! (Even though, his mind added, Granger seemed to have done exactly that.) And even if he had had unrealistic expectations like that, why single out Harry that way?!\n\u201cWhat is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\u201d Snape continued, and Draco narrowed his eyes at the Professor, starting to feel indignant anger at his only friend being attacked like that.\nGranger had now gotten to her feet in an attempt at gaining Snape\u2019s attention, but the teacher\u2019s dark eyes were still zoomed in on Harry in something like maliciousness.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Harry said quietly. His expression was defiant. \u201cI think Hermione does, though. Why don\u2019t you try her?\u201d\nThe Gryffindors laughed, and Draco had to bite down on a smile. A part of him, the part that was Harry\u2019s friend and was outraged at the way their teacher tried to bully him, was cheering for the snark the other boy was showing. Another part, the one that was a Slytherin through and through, knew that this had been entirely the wrong thing to say, and a look at Snape\u2019s face confirmed those suspicions.\n\u201cSit down!,\u201d Snape snapped at Granger, before continuing, towards Harry: \u201cFor your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? \u201d he asked, looking up at the class. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you all copying that down?\u201d\nEveryone suddenly leapt for their quills to obey, but Draco was still staring at Snape resentfully, trying to figure out what in Merlin\u2019s name he was missing here.\n\u201cAnd a point will be taken from Gryffindor house for your cheek, Potter,\u201d Snape added, quite unpleasantly. Harry flushed, and Draco\u2019s eyes narrowed once more. Finally, Snape\u2019s dark eyes fell on him. \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to say, Mr Malfoy?\u201d he asked, raising an eyebrow.\nDraco stared at him for another moment, a thousand answers much more scathing that Harry\u2019s little comment going through his head, before finally, he shook his head.\n\u201cThen why aren\u2019t you taking notes?\u201d Snape demanded, and without another word, Draco picked up his quill and started writing. And if he was pressing the tip to the parchment a little too harshly, well, no one but Harry would ever know.\nAs they proceeded their lesson and Draco paired up with Harry to brew their first potion, Snape continued to pick on the other Gryffindors as well, but he seemed to dislike Harry the most by far. It infuriated Draco to no end. He did not care much whether Snape snapped at Longbottom or not - after all, the boy had conducted a ridiculous accident that had, quite frankly speaking, endangered everyone in his surroundings. But when he blamed Harry for not warning the idiot boy, Draco was tempted to throw the cauldron of their unfinished potion right into their Professor\u2019s face. Still, he grabbed Harry\u2019s wrist when the other boy opened his mouth to argue, squeezing hard to shut him up.\n\n\n\u201cCheer up,\u201d Weasley told Harry when, an hour later, they were finally released from the dungeons. \u201cSnape\u2019s always taking points off Fred and George. I heard he hates all students apart from Slytherins.\u201d\n\u201cStill!\u201d Draco snarled, relieved at being able to voice the anger he had felt bubbling inside of him throughout the whole lesson. \u201cRounding up like this on Harry was so unfair! What in Merlin\u2019s name is Harry supposed to have done to him?!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Harry mumbled, quite miserably. \u201cHe seems to hate me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing personal,\u201d Weasley shrugged, but he could convince neither Draco nor Harry with that. Still, he continued, as if the subject was closed: \u201cHarry, can I come with you to meet Hagrid?\u201d\n\u201cMeet Hagrid?\u201d Draco asked.\n\u201cYes, he invited me over this morning,\u201d Harry explained. \u201cYou wanna come, too?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Draco smiled, feeling a lot happier at being included like that. It was not like he had any real desire to visit the overgrown gamekeeper who his father had described as 'savage' - then again, he had praised Snape - but any time he could spend with Harry was time spent well, in his opinion. Especially opposed to being locked up in his dormitory trying to stay out of Nott\u2019s path.\nSo they made their way out to the school grounds and down to the little hut near the Forbidden Forest where Rubeus Hagrid lived. The man greeted them cheerfully, though he was struggling to rule in his monstrous boarhound that seemed keen on jumping them. The insides of Hagrid\u2019s hut were meagre and there was barely any place to sit, so Draco kept close to Harry and tried to make himself as small as possible, nervously watching as the dog crowded Weasley and tried to lick off his face. His mother\u2019s voice was shrieking in his head not to touch a thing, but when Hagrid offered them tea, it would have been impolite to refuse.\n\u201cHagrid, this is Ron,\u201d Harry introduced Weasley, gesturing to where the redhead was almost disappearing underneath the canine body. \u201cAnd this is Draco.\u201d Draco quickly plastered a smile on his face and nodded in greeting.\n\u201cAnother Weasley, eh?,\u201d Hagrid asked as he put dubious-looking cake onto plates in front of them. \u201cI spent half me life chasin' your brothers away from the Forest.\u201d Weasley grinned sheepishly before Hagrid\u2019s dark eyes focused on Draco. \u201cAnd yeh\u2019re the Malfoy kid, aren\u2019 yeh?,\u201d he asked, frowning.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco confirmed, shifting uncomfortably next to Harry and his fingers grasping at his teacup nervously.\nHagrid just hummed, not commenting further on Draco\u2019s parentage.\n\u201cSo, tell me, how was yer first week? I want ter hear everything!\u201d\nAs Harry and Ron launched into a retelling of their impressions, the dog moved on to lay his head in Harry\u2019s lap, but thankfully stayed away from Draco. Maybe it was sensing his nerves. He poked at the rock cake on his plate but didn\u2019t dare eat it. He warmed up towards the giant man, though, when he cursed Filch, the castle\u2019s horrible caretaker, and his sorry excuse for a cat, so Draco tentatively started to join their conversation, throwing in a comment here and there. Like Ron, Hagrid reassured Harry that Snape didn\u2019t have a personal grudge against him, but Draco thought he seemed shifty at Harry\u2019s insistence that the potions teacher seemed to hate him, and he quickly changed the subject towards Weasley\u2019s brother. Harry caught Draco\u2019s eyes, and he knew that the other boy had noticed, too.\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d Harry said finally, his tone quiet as the other two chatted away. \u201cWill you tell me now what Nott has done to your robes?\u201d\nDraco sighed, averting his gaze to the table. His eyes fell on a cutting of a newspaper article on Hagrid\u2019s table, and he picked it up, in want of something to distract Harry from that line of questioning.\n\u201c\u2018Gringotts Break-In Latest\u2019,\u201d he read out loud, frowning. \u201cWho would be stupid enough to break into Gringotts?\u201d\n\u201cNevermind that now!\u201d Harry muttered, exasperated, but when Draco skimmed the article and pointed out that the break-in had happened on the day they had first met at Madam Malkin\u2019s, Harry held in, stunned.\n\u201cShow me,\u201d he muttered, taking the cutting and reading the article for himself. Finally, he exclaimed: \u201cHagrid, that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might have even happened while we were there!\u201d\nHagrid froze, then grunted noncommittally, seeming even more nervous than before.\n\u201cMore cake?\u201d he enquired.\n\n\n\u201cWhen we went to Gringotts that day, Hagrid emptied a vault,\u201d Harry told Draco and Weasley later, as they made their way up to the school again. \u201cSaid it was Hogwarts business, and that he couldn\u2019t tell me what it was about. But what if that was what the thief was after?\u201d\nWeasley\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cMerlin,\u201d he breathed. \u201cWhat do you think it was? What did it look like?\u201d\n\u201cSmall,\u201d Harry shrugged, brows furrowed. \u201cAnd wrapped up in some cloth. I didn\u2019t really get a good look.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Draco shrugged. \u201cWhatever it was, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s stored somewhere safe now.\u201d\nHarry looked thoughtful, but then, he looked up at him, his eyes narrowing slightly.\n\u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me what Nott did,\u201d he pointed out.\nDraco sighed, rolling his eyes. \u201cYou won\u2019t drop it, will you?\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said simply, an air of finality in his tone. Draco\u2019s shoulder slumped, resigned.\n\u201cHe tore them to pieces,\u201d Draco muttered. \u201cRemoved the Slytherin crest and everything.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Harry called, coming to a sudden hold and grabbing Draco\u2019s wrist. \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you tell Snape this morning?!\u201d\n\u201cBecause that would just make things worse,\u201d Draco explained defensively. \u201cNext time, they\u2019ll feed my trunk to the Giant Squid or-\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let them get away with it!\u201d Harry protested.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like down there in the Slytherin quarters, Harry!\u201d Draco groaned. \u201cEveryone hates me as it is, and if I start to fight them, they will all turn against me, not only Nott! It\u2019s better to keep my head down and not draw any attention to myself!\u201d\n\u201cWhy do they hate you?\u201d Harry asked, bewildered.\nDraco looked at his shoes, unable to answer. It was Weasley, though, who spoke.\n\u201cYou heard what Nott said,\u201d he grumbled bitterly. \u201cHe associates with blood traitors, like my family, or I guess yours, Harry.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t call you that!,\u201d Draco said sharply.\n\u201cBut your father does,\u201d Weasley spat. \u201cDad talked about him at home, you know, and how he thinks our family isn\u2019t worth a Knut because we don\u2019t have as much money, and because we don\u2019t think Muggles are scum.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Father is wrong!\u201d Draco exclaimed defiantly. A part of him couldn\u2019t believe that he was talking this disrespectfully about his parents, but he pressed it down until it shut up. \u201cI think differently! Obviously,\u201d he muttered. \u201cOr I wouldn\u2019t be the joke of every Slytherin student at this school.\u201d\nWeasley observed him suspiciously, as if any moment, Draco would crack and start insulting him and his family the way Weasley apparently expected him to.\n\u201cI believe Draco,\u201d Harry vowed, at last, drawing both their attention to him. \u201cMy aunt and uncle are absolutely horrible,\u201d Harry shrugged. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019m anything like them. So why does Draco have to be like his father?\u201d he turned to Draco, smiling tentatively. \u201cI don\u2019t care if your father is a prat, or if-\u201d he gulped, throwing a short look at Weasley before meeting his eyes again, determination shining in those green orbs. \u201c-or if he was a follower of Voldemort. I know you\u2019re different, and you\u2019re my friend.\u201d\nDraco held his breath, his throat tightening up in emotion. What he ended up saying, though, quite irrationally, was: \u201cYou\u2019re saying his name.\u201d\n\u201cHe tends to do that,\u201d Weasley made a face.\nThere was an uncomfortable silence between them, before Draco whispered, at last: \u201cThank you, Harry.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to thank me,\u201d Harry huffed, looking uncomfortable. \u201cJust, if Nott is giving you a hard time again, tell me. You\u2019re not alone.\u201d\nDraco smiled, and for the first time since he had received it, he felt like thanking the Draco of the future for his letter.\n\n\nThe matter of the torn robes solved itself, quite surprisingly. When Draco came back to his dormitory that night, they lay folded on his bed, perfectly repaired and washed. It was then that Draco remembered that Hogwarts had house elves working in the background, too.\nThe matter of Nott was not to be solved that easily, though, but now that Harry was his friend, Draco did not mind as much. He spent much more time out of the Slytherin quarters with him and a rather reluctant Weasley, hanging back in the Great Hall after dinner and playing Wizard\u2019s Chess or Exploding Snap, or doing homework together in the library. When Draco did have to return, he went straight to his bed and drew the curtains, reading or studying. And whenever Nott tried to bully him, he held his head high and threw a well-phrased insult back at him. The other seemed furious at Draco\u2019s new-found confidence, but Draco refused to feel threatened. He was not going to be the laughing stock of his house any longer.\n\u201cDid you see the notice?,\u201d Draco asked cheerfully, pushing some of the sweets his mother had sent him this morning over towards the other two as they lay spread out on the grass, brooding over their Charms homework and enjoying the golden September day. \u201cFlying Lessons start on Thursday, and Slytherins and Gryffindors will be grouped together!\u201d\nWeasley grunted at that, obviously less than pleased at the prospect, but Harry smiled at Draco, which he took as an invitation to babble on.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to finally be allowed up in the air again! \u201d he grinned, rolling onto his back and resting his head on his book to look up at the sky. \u201cThough it\u2019s a shame I couldn\u2019t bring my own broom! I bet the school brooms are rubbish.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you crashed yours when almost colliding with that flying Muggle windmill,\u201d Weasley commented innocently.\n\u201cHelicopter,\u201d Harry corrected, and there was amusement in his eyes as he turned the pages of his book.\nDraco willed himself not to blush. He might have slightly exaggerated a story or two about his prior adventures on the broom, but Harry had been so eager to listen and he hadn\u2019t been able to help himself. Plus, Weasley had gone on and on about that one time he had almost collided with a hang glider when using his brother\u2019s broom, and Draco had just had to surpass that story.\n\u201cI got a new one after that,\u201d Draco lied off-handedly, making Weasley roll his eyes. \u201cI will have to use my holidays to practice for Quidditch tryouts in second year, after all.\u201d He quickly shut up though when he saw Harry\u2019s clouded look at the mention of the Wizarding sport he didn\u2019t understand. Both Draco and Weasley had spent a lot of time trying to introduce Harry to the rules and the teams, but Draco could tell that while Harry was curious, he felt a little too much on the outside during these conversations. So Draco had started to avoid them, for the most part.\n\u201cI just hope I\u2019m not going to make a fool of myself in front of Nott,\u201d Harry grumbled.\n\u201cYou will not,\u201d Draco protested, turning his head to frown at him. \u201cI saw Nott on a broom before. Trolls have more grace than he does. You will be flying circles around him once you get the hang of it, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\nHarry looked unconvinced, but he did not voice his doubts, instead muttering: \u201cI just wished I could get the better of him at something. He\u2019s the biggest git I ever met, and that\u2019s saying something, considering I used to live with Dudley. I hate how he treats everyone as if they are beneath him, and I especially hate how he treats you!\u201d\nDraco felt warm at the protectiveness in Harry\u2019s words. He highly objected to the idea that he could not watch out for himself, but the affection for Draco hidden behind Harry\u2019s hate for Nott made Draco feel more treasured than he had hoped to be after only a week of school. He had quickly learned that Harry had a strong sense of justice and would stand up for others in need, but Draco told himself that his hate for Nott was mainly down to the fact that he bullied Draco, and that he thought Draco was someone special. Someone worth protecting.\n\u201cWho cares about Nott,\u201d was what Draco ended up saying, emphasising his words with a casual shrug. \u201cLet him play the big bully on the playground if he wants to. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s got anything else in his life. If my only friends were Crabbe and Goyle, I\u2019d be frustrated, too.\u201d\nHarry laughed at that, and even Weasley cracked a smile.\nWhen Thursday rolled around, Draco was practically buzzing with energy. The day was sunny and the conditions for flying were perfect, and as they waited for the Gryffindors and the teacher to arrive at the lawn out on the grounds, Draco was not even bothered by Nott\u2019s obnoxious boasting and the condescending comments directed towards him.\nThe Gryffindors all arrived in a group, and Draco quickly found Harry alongside Weasley and Longbottom, sending him a broad smile. Harry grinned back and pointedly walked over to where Draco was standing quite apart from the other Slytherins, claiming the broom next to him. Weasley and Longbottom followed rather reluctantly, the latter glancing nervously over at Nott - Draco had heard that he, too, had been a repeated victim of Nott\u2019s abusive behaviour.\nWhen their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived, she immediately ordered them towards their brooms.\n\u201cStick out your right hand over your broom and say \u2018Up!\u2019,\u201d she commanded briskly.\nThere was a chorus of \u201cUp!\u201d, and Draco smiled in satisfaction when his broom jumped up into his hand obediently. So did Harry\u2019s, he noted. Harry looked pretty amazed at his instant success and returned the grin Draco sent him.\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to correctly mount their brooms, but as Draco, unlike most other students in this class, was anything but a newbie to the practice of flying, he only paid her explanation half-hearted attention. Instead, he let his eyes wander among the group, snickering to himself when Nott, Crabbe and Goyle all had to be prodded into the right stance by Madam Hooch.\n\u201cTold you they had no talent for flying,\u201d he hissed at Harry, who smiled as he concentrated on adjusting his own posture. Draco lazily mounted his broom and waited for the teacher to come along.\n\u201cLeft hand underneath the right one, Mr Malfoy!\u201d\nThe teacher\u2019s voice made him jump, and he flushed as he found her yellow eyes fixed on him. He quickly adjusted his hands, cursing under his breath.\n\u201cThumbs up!\u201d she ordered. \u201cUp, I said - how will you steer the broom successfully if you hold on like this?! Yes, that\u2019s it.\u201d\nDraco felt utterly humiliated as she finally turned away from him and moved on towards Harry, and Weasley\u2019s smirk, easily noticeable from where he stood at Harry\u2019s other side, did nothing to quench his embarrassment.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Madam Hooch finally called. \u201cWhen I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground hard. Keep your broom steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forwards slightly.\u201d Draco grabbed his broom a little tighter, keen to prove how good of a flyer he really was. \u201cOn my whistle! Three - two -\u201d\nBut before Madam Hooch could blow her whistle, Longbottom caused a commotion by rising from the ground too early and finding himself unable to dive back to the ground even with Madam Hooch shouting directions up at him. In the end, he slipped off the broom and fell from about twenty feet height, breaking his wrist. Madam Hooch had to accompany him to the hospital wing, leaving the class under firm instructions to keep their feet on the ground.\nPredictably, the Slytherins started to snicker and poke fun at Longbottom\u2019s stunt the moment she was out of hearing distance.\n\u201cWhat an oaf!\u201d Pansy Parkinson giggled as Daphne Greengrass wiped her tears of laughter from her cheeks. \u201cDid you see his face?!\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Parkinson!\u201d a dark-skinned Gryffindor girl snapped at her, making the pug-nosed girl coo: \u201cOooh, sticking up for Longbottom? Never thought you\u2019d like fat little crybabies, Parvati!\u201d\nDraco rolled his eyes, turning towards Harry to comment on how Pansy Parkinson had no right to call anyone a crybaby after her birthday party last year - but Nott\u2019s booming voice interrupted him when he held a little glass ball into the air, showing it off to everyone.\n\u201cLook what Longbottom lost,\u201d he snickered, and only then did Draco recognise it as a Remembrall.\n\u201cGive that here, Nott,\u201d Harry suddenly said from next to him, in a deadly calm voice.\nNott laughed, turning to face Harry, his eyes glinting.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d he said gleefully. \u201cThe saviour of all losers. Isn\u2019t protecting Malfoy enough of a pet project? Do you still have time to take care of Longbottom, too?\u201d\nDraco flushed angrily, and before Harry could say anything further, Draco stepped forward and tried to snatch the Remembrall out of Nott\u2019s hand. Nott evaded him, laughing in delight.\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s a club!\u201d he called. \u201cMalfoy, Longbottom and Weasley, all charges of the famous Harry Potter! Must be a merry little group where you all sit star-eyed and worship him.\u201d\nDraco reached for the Remembrall again, furious, but Nott, in a sudden burst of inspiration, flung it through the air and towards the walls of the castle.\nEverything after that happened very fast. He did not see Harry mount his broom, but he could hear Granger screech something at him and then, Harry was up in the air, flying after the Remembrall with a speed and finesse that made Draco stare with an open mouth. Before he knew it, Harry had caught the little ball, only seconds before it would have crashed against the stone wall.\nThe Gryffindors (apart from Granger, who looked rather alarmed) were cheering and clapping, but Draco could only stare as Harry grinned down at them, leaning forward to land back among them. But\u2026 This was Harry\u2019s first time on a broom! How come he was so good at it?! Draco had been flying for years, and he was pretty sure he could not have caught that ball!\nA loud call of \u201cHarry Potter!\u201d made silence fall upon them, and the grin slipped from Harry\u2019s face, replaced instead with an expression of horror that reflected how Draco felt. Professor McGonagall was marching towards them, a look of shock and incredulity on her face.\n\u201cNever\u2026 In all my time at Hogwarts-\u201d she gasped, and Draco raked his brain for something to say. \u201cHow dare you! Might have broken your neck!\u201d Several Gryffindors spoke up in Harry\u2019s defence, and Draco opened his mouth too, pointing at Nott, but McGonagall shushed them all and demanded Harry to follow her.\nHarry trotted after McGonagall in utter doom, and Draco furiously turned back towards Nott, who was grinning in triumph.\n\u201cYou complete arse!\u201d Draco hissed, reaching out to grasp Nott\u2019s robe and shake him. \u201cIf Harry\u2019s going to get expelled I\u2019m going to-\u201d\nBut that\u2019s how far he came before Crabbe and Goyle had grabbed him and pulled him away violently, throwing him back until he had painfully landed on his butt. Weasley came, quite surprisingly, to his violent defence, and soon, chaos had fallen upon their group that was only to be silenced by Madam Hooch\u2019s return. Several students got points taken from both houses, including Draco, Weasley, Nott, Crabbe, Goyle, Parkinson and that Gryffindor girl she\u2019d been quarrelling with earlier. She then sent them off early, threatening that if they didn\u2019t behave next week, both their houses would be exempted from Flying Lessons in the future.\nThey all returned to the castle in a lousy mood, and Draco walked next to Weasley in tense silence.\n\u201cDo you think Harry\u2019s okay?\u201d Draco asked finally.\n\u201cIf not, I\u2019m going to punch Nott in the face,\u201d Weasley groaned. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t even care if I\u2019ll be expelled alongside him for it. That bastard deserves it.\u201d\nThey need not have worried, though. Harry turned up at dinner like nothing had happened, and when Draco left the Great Hall after, he was pulled aside and filled in on what had happened in a whispered conversation.\n\u201cYou were made Seeker for Gryffindor?!\u201d Draco gasped, a little too loudly, and Harry put a hand over his mouth to keep him quiet.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone! \u201d Harry demanded. \u201cWood wants it to be a secret! But yes, I start training next week.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re in first year! \u201d Draco spoke against Harry\u2019s hand, his voice muffled. \u201cFirst years can\u2019t play on their house teams!\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rule against it,\u201d Harry shrugged, finally lowering his hand. \u201cBut it seems I\u2019m the youngest house player in a century or something.\u201d\nDraco gaped at him, relief over Harry\u2019s lack of punishment mingling with incredulity and jealousy.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Draco muttered. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t my best friend, I\u2019d hate your guts for this.\u201d\nHarry grinned sheepishly.\nDue to Harry\u2019s lack of punishment following the events of their first flying lesson, Nott became even more vicious than before. Not only did he bully his victims more and more publicly, but he also widened his field of victims. Among it were now, apart from Draco and Longbottom, Harry and Weasley, and depending on his mood, every Gryffindor student he came across.\nDraco, though, was still his favourite punch ball. In the following week, Draco found all his school books drenched by a sticky green fluid that smelled strongly of rotten eggs, his Astronomy essay handed over to Millicent Bulstrode\u2019s cat to sharpen her claws with, and himself pushed down a set of stairs high enough that he ended up in the hospital wing overnight. Thankfully, McGonagall happened to walk in on that last one, and though he had been unconscious, he had heard from Harry afterwards that she had yelled at Nott, Crabbe and Goyle for ten minutes straight and given them detention for the rest of the month.\nHarry, needless to mention, was livid at Nott\u2019s recent behaviour. He got into fights with him almost once a day, and whenever someone only uttered his name, Harry\u2019s green eyes would narrow and his fists clench.\nIt all seemed to have escalated, though, on the night Draco had been hospitalised. Madam Pomfrey let him out of her care in time for breakfast, and when he hurried down the corridors towards the Great Hall, he almost collided with Harry. The other boy was alone, for once, without his usual red-headed shadow, and he was carrying a couple of sandwiches in his arms.\n\u201cI was looking for you,\u201d Harry told him, his eyes bright as he pushed the food at him. \u201cI have to talk to you. Alone.\u201d\nDraco was intrigued, but he gratefully accepted the offering and followed Harry out onto the grounds for a walk. Harry did not speak until they were safely out of everyone\u2019s earshot.\n\u201cSo, last night,\u201d Harry began. \u201cNott challenged me to a duel.\u201d\nDraco almost choked on his bite of bread. \u201cWhat? \u201d he asked, stunned.\n\u201cI called him out because of his stunt with the stairs, and then he suddenly started babbling about Wizarding Duels and asked me to meet him in the Trophy Room at midnight. I didn\u2019t really understand most of what he was saying, to be honest. Ron stepped in to handle the talking.\u201d\n\u201cHow kind of him,\u201d Draco commented, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go, did you? It was obviously a trap.\u201d When Harry looked embarrassed, Draco\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou didn\u2019t! Harry, what the -\u201d\n\u201cRon had accepted before I even knew what was going on! \u201d Harry said defensively. \u201cAnd then I couldn\u2019t back out!\u201d\n\u201cWhy, because Weasley said so?\u201d Draco challenged. \u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t get caught, like Nott so obviously intended you to?\u201d\n\u201cWe almost did,\u201d Harry muttered, his voice small. \u201cBut we escaped.\u201d\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d Draco rolled his eyes. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about this when you came to see me in the hospital wing last night? I would have told you not to go!\u201d\nHarry bit his lip. \u201cRon said-\u201d\n\u201cOh, right,\u201d Draco spat, his temper flaring up immediately. \u201cBecause Weasley is to be more trusted in knowing how Nott\u2019s mind works than I am.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I was saying! \u201d Harry protested. \u201cWhy are you getting so worked up over this?!\u201d\n\u201cBecause, Harry,\u201d Draco snapped. \u201cYou should have come to me first! It\u2019s always Weasley, whether he is even qualified to give you advice on that particular matter or not! I always hear about everything last, and I\u2019m sick of it!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t-\u201d Harry began, gulping and frowning at him. \u201cThat\u2019s not-\u201d\n\u201cYou know it is!\u201d Draco insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m not one of your beloved housemates or because Weasley feeds you stories about my father-\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about any of that! \u201d Harry called. \u201cYou know that!\u201d\n\u201cThen why am I always second best?!\u201d Draco demanded, an edge to his voice.\nHonestly, he didn\u2019t know why he was making a scene. Harry had been a good friend to him, and deep down, he knew that the boy had just wanted to avenge him\u2026 But the jealousy towards Weasley had been there from the first day of school, bubbling inside of him like lava, and now, it all just spilt over.\n\u201cYou could have gotten in serious trouble last night,\u201d Draco pointed out. \u201cYou could have been expelled, and it would have all been Weasley\u2019s fault for pushing you into it! But sure, keep confiding in him instead of me, why don\u2019t you!\u201d\nAnd with that, Draco stormed off, leaving a shell-shocked Harry behind.\n\n\nDraco hid in the owlery for the rest of the day. He couldn't explain why he had chosen this particular place to sulk - it was dirty and the windy, but Aquila let him pet his feathers and sat close to him, and somehow, that made him feel a little calmer.\nAfter a while, Harry\u2019s snowy owl flew over to join them, too. Maybe she recognised him as a friend of Harry\u2019s. Her big amber eyes were watching him curiously, as if she knew it was her owner that had made him upset.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to fight with him,\u201d Draco whispered, sounding as miserable as he felt. \u201cI just hate feeling so inconsequential next to Weasley.\u201d Hedwig hooted softly, as if acknowledging his words. \u201cWhat\u2019s so great about that freckled git?\u201d Draco muttered. \u201cWhat does he have that I don\u2019t?\u201d\nHedwig just tipped her head to the side. Aquila hooted from next to him, fluttering until he landed on his shoulder, gently nipping at his hair.\nIt was at that moment that Harry burst through the door. He was out of breath and looked around frantically until he spotted Draco sitting on a bench, surrounded by their owls. Hedwig let out a high pitched screech and flew over to him. Harry held out his hand for her to land on, petting her head absentmindedly. He was staring at Draco, though.\n\u201cFred and George told me they\u2019d seen you up here,\u201d he answered the unvoiced question hanging between them. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you all day.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Draco drawled, looking at Hedwig instead of Harry.\nDraco wasn\u2019t good at this. Apologies. Rejection. Not getting exactly what he wanted. It was Harry, though, who took over for him, much to his surprise.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Draco!\u201d he said, quite urgently. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you, or make you think that I trust you less than Ron. I was angry at Nott, and you were still pretty out of it at the hospital last night, and I just\u2026 I guess I didn\u2019t want to worry you.\u201d There was a slight intake of breath, before he muttered: \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\nDraco met Harry\u2019s eyes then, and saw fear in those startling green orbs. It was then that Draco remembered that Harry had never had real friends until Hogwarts, either; that he was as new to all of this as Draco was, and, more importantly, that he was probably just as scared of all of it disappearing again.\n\u201cI hate when you tell Weasley things before you tell me,\u201d Draco pointed out, because he was a Malfoy and it was in his nature to always want to have the last word. \u201cI know it can\u2019t be helped sometimes. We don\u2019t share a common room, and are separated for most of our classes. But you\u2019re my only friend, and I don\u2019t want to be second best to you.\u201d\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t! \u201d Harry shook his head. \u201cYou are just as important to me as Ron is! And I promise I\u2019ll tell you everything immediately from now on!\u201d\nDraco let go of a breath he had not known he was holding, warmth spreading through him at those words. Finally, he nodded.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too. For making a scene.\u201d\nHarry smiled tentatively, and he crossed the distance between them, sitting next to Draco on the bench. He ran his fingers through Hedwig\u2019s feathers affectionately, and she closed her eyes, looking content.\n\u201cAre we okay, then?\u201d Harry asked, at last, and when Draco nodded, he added: \u201cCan I now tell you what I really wanted to tell you this morning?\u201d\nDraco smiled, and Aquila hooted softly from his place on Draco\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cSure,\u201d he agreed.\nHarry then dived into the story about how the previous night, he and Weasley had stumbled over Longbottom and Granger, and how they had followed them and how, when they had figured out that they had been tricked, they had accidentally fled into the forbidden third-floor-corridor trying to escape Filch, and what they had found there.\n\u201cA three-headed dog?!\u201d Draco hissed, whirling around to look at Harry so abruptly that Aquila complained with a loud screech and flew off towards the other end of the oval tower, glowering at Draco reproachfully from the shadows. Hedwig joined him, leaving Harry and Draco alone on the bench. \u201cWhat the bloody hell would Dumbledore keep such a thing in a school for?!\u201d\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s guarding whatever Hagrid got out of Gringotts the day of the break-in,\u201d Harry muttered.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Draco shuddered. \u201cIt must be really valuable then. Though I don\u2019t get why they think Hogwarts is safer than Gringotts. They have tons of stuff to guard it there. Why would a vicious dog with too many heads and a bunch of kids keep whoever is after it out when they took their chances with dragons and who knows what else?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Harry frowned, as if he hadn\u2019t thought about it that way. \u201cHagrid seems to reckon here\u2019s safer. Maybe it\u2019s because of Dumbledore?\" Harry shrugged, then continued: \u201cI really want to know what it is the dog is guarding, though.\u201d\n\u201cProbably some kind of invaluable magical object,\u201d Draco mused. \u201cOr something really dark. I heard stories about old artefacts that, if they ended up in the wrong hands\u2026\u201d\nHe dived into a retelling of gruesome tales he had heard from his father, and the way Harry listened so intently and speculated with him until the sun was setting and they had to go back to the castle cheered Draco up immensely. He wished it could always be like this, he thought to himself - just him and Harry, with the other boy\u2019s attention completely on him, and no Weasley around to ruin the day.\n\n\nUntil Halloween, a strange new normality formed in Draco\u2019s life: Whenever it was not lesson or meal time, he would stick to Harry, who would sometimes have Weasley in his tow, but would also meet him on his own increasingly often. It seemed to Draco like Weasley had grudgingly accepted that Harry\u2019s friendship to Draco was a thing now and that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere, so he had decided to give them some space. This suited Draco quite well - the more time he got to spend alone with Harry, the easier it was for him to accept that Weasley was the one at his side through most other times of the day.\nNott was still doing his best to abuse Draco, verbally and, if he could get away with it, in every other imaginable way, but after Draco\u2019s injury, the teachers, especially Professor McGonagall, had started keeping a closer eye on them, so they had to be more careful.\nHagrid, on his part, had gotten wind of the way his housemates treated Draco, and had gifted him a chest that would bite everyone but him who tried to reach inside, and which had successfully kept his possessions out of Nott\u2019s grabby hands ever since. To say that the thoughtful gift had surprised Draco would be an understatement; he had warmed up to the giant gamekeeper so much he would accompany Harry to visit him almost at weekly intervals.\nAs Halloween approached, the castle was decorated spectacularly, and despite the fact that he was seated among his fellow Slytherins, Draco was quite enjoying the feast that evening. Life bats were fluttering through the Great Hall, and giant pumpkins were festively hollowed and had had scary faces carved, illuminating the Great Hall with flickering candlelight.\nThe feast was cut short, though, when suddenly Professor Quirrell, their Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, burst into the Great Hall gasping about a troll in the dungeons. In an instant, every student was on their feet, and the panicked crowd was only to be reigned in by Dumbledore himself, who ordered the Prefects to take their houses back to their common rooms. Which technically wasn't a half-bad idea, Draco thought, if you forgot the fact that the Slytherin common room was located in the dungeons. Several of his housemates seemed to have come to the same conclusion, and there were vehement protests from various sides as their Prefects tried to steer them out into the entrance hall and down the stairs.\nIt was through this chaos that Draco spotted Harry and Weasley separating from their group of Gryffindors and running down another corridor, determined and quite unaccompanied. Draco had only a moment to blanch - stupid, reckless, impossible Gryffindors - before he was running after them, fully intending to pull them back by their robes if he had to.\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Draco called, and they looked over their shoulders as Draco approached. \u201cWhat in Merlin\u2019s name are you-\u201d\n\u201cHermione!\u201d Harry called, as if that should mean anything to Draco, but just as he had opened his mouth to snap back at the other boy, he added: \u201cShe\u2019s in the bathroom, and she doesn\u2019t know-\u201d\n\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you tell a teacher?\u201d Draco demanded. \u201cWhy did you have to-\u201d\n\u201cOh, shut up, Malfoy!\u201d Weasley snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting all our breath!\u201d\nAnd with that, they turned back around and picked up speed, and Draco could do nothing but follow after them.\n\u201cThis is stupid!\u201d Draco announced, because he could complain and run at the same time, thank you very much. \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t she at the feast to begin with?! And why do you have to be her babysitter?! If we come across that troll, I swear to Salazar-\u201d\nBut Harry and Weasley had stopped in their tracks, and Harry had clasped a hand over Draco\u2019s mouth to shut him up. They slipped behind a large stone gryffin, and finally, Draco saw the reason for their hold up: Snape was crossing the corridors ahead of them in far steps, heading up a couple of stairs. For a moment, Draco considered fighting Harry off and calling out to him for help, but then he figured that they\u2019d be in enormous trouble if Snape caught them out alone like this against the Headmaster\u2019s orders.\n\u201cHe\u2019s heading for the third floor!\u201d Harry hissed. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing? Why isn\u2019t he down in the dungeons with the other teachers?\u201d\n\u201cSearch me,\u201d Weasley muttered, and Draco finally succeeded in pushing Harry\u2019s hand from his face. He opened his mouth to say something scathing, before holding in, frowning and wrinkling his nose.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d he enquired, causing Harry and Weasley to both sniff and make a face in turn. Then, they heard heavy, shuffling footsteps from a corridor towards their left, and when they turned around the corner to look, they spotted the giant monster that was inevitably going to hunt his nightmares from now on scuffling along in the dark.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Draco breathed. \u201cI don\u2019t like this. Let\u2019s go back, please.\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Weasley hissed, and Harry clasped his hand back over Draco\u2019s mouth, so he could only stare in horror as the thing moved along the corridor and disappeared into an open door.\n\u201cThe key\u2019s in the lock! \u201d Harry muttered. \u201cWe could lock it in!\u201d\n\u201cGood idea!\u201d Ron said, and they had just begun to move towards the door when Draco grasped Harry\u2019s arm, holding him back.\n\u201cWait!\u201d Draco hissed. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say Granger was in the bathroom?! This is the girl\u2019s bathroom, you morons!\u201d\nThe other two just stared at him for a moment, stunned, and then, a high-pitched scream broke through the silence.\n\u201cHermione!\u201d Harry and Weasley called, and started running. Draco, cursing his luck and his life choices, followed reluctantly.\n\n\nIn hindsight, Draco did not remember how they had survived the whole thing. There was a lot of screaming and the troll smashing half the bathroom with his club, and at one point, Harry had hung in the air. Somehow, though, Weasley had managed to knock the thing out with its own weapon due to some feebly cast spell, and Draco had just started to feel his legs again when the teachers had burst into the room.\nDraco had never been so sure of his own doom. He had already been wondering what his father would do to him if he got expelled within his first term and if he\u2019d be allowed to go to another school abroad. Maybe Beauxbatons. He spoke French, after all. Or Durmstrang. His father had considered the school for him at some point, but he would have to learn German or Russian, and Draco did not fancy the declination of those two languages. Or maybe Ilvermorny, though really, it sounded like a second-class Hogwarts. Though if he was expelled here, he might as well. And they spoke English, though sometimes it didn\u2019t sound like it.\nQuite surprisingly, though, his inner monologue had been interrupted by Hermione Granger, official Know-It-All and Goody-Two-Shoes of their year and most annoying existence Draco had ever encountered (and that included some mad paintings in the West Wing of Malfoy Manor), who saved them from punishment by taking the blame onto herself.\n\u201cI went looking for the troll because I - I thought I could deal with it on my own, you know, because I read all about them,\u201d she lied, making Draco, Harry and Weasley gape at her like she had just turned into a step-dancing Filch. \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t found me, I\u2019d be dead now!\u201d\nIt was the most bizarre thing Draco had ever experienced - the unconscious troll lying between them, drooling over the floor, as Granger told a straight-out lie to the teachers in an attempt to save their skin. Though, Draco figured, they had come to save hers in the first place. It was probably good manners to return the favour, in a world that was not ruled by Slytherins. Maybe he would have to take notes.\nIn the end, Draco, Harry and Weasley each won points for their houses and were lectured about their sheer luck by Professor McGonagall (as if Draco needed to be reminded of how high the possibility of his death had been), and then, they were released, quite unharmed and still very much enrolled at this school.\nThe strangest outcome of it all, though, was that from that point on, Granger joined their unlikely group whenever they hung out together, and by some weird agreement that probably had happened within the Gryffindor common room while he hadn\u2019t been around, they all became friends. Draco was not sure what exactly he felt about the fact that he had to count Weasley and Granger among his friends now, but he figured, as long as Harry was there, he could deal with it. \nAs November passed and snow started falling onto the Hogwarts grounds, Draco learned two things. The first was that Hermione Granger, though he had always thought her an annoying Know-It-All, was a very useful friend to have. It was not that Draco needed help with his studies, but she was usually a much more competent conversation partner than Harry or especially Weasley, and when they did their homework together, he picked up interesting details he would not have thought of himself. Not only did this win Hermione Draco\u2019s respect, but she also turned out much more relaxed and less annoying now that she had actual friends to hang out with. It made Draco wonder how he\u2019d have behaved if he\u2019d been all alone in the school, without Harry to rely on. He might have been just as much of a nuisance, he figured, which made him decide to overlook Hermione\u2019s behavior for the earlier part of the term altogether.\nThe second thing he learned was that Gryffindors, and especially Harry, were a nosy bunch of tossers. Growing up in a Slytherin environment, Draco had quickly learned not to stick his nose into things that were none of his business, unless he wanted it burned - or at least, to do it smartly if there was no choice but to. Harry, though, seemed to have missed that part of his education entirely. It had been fun at first, discussing what the three-headed dog was guarding and who it needed guarding against, but when Snape had started limping after his trip to the third-floor corridor on Halloween and Harry had (quite accidentally, he ensured Draco) overheard Snape admitting that the injury had been caused by the monster, and much worse, had let himself be caught in the act of listening in, Draco began to worry about his obsession. It did not help in the slightest that, when Harry\u2019s first Quidditch match finally rolled around, someone hexed his broom to throw him off. Draco had been too shell-shocked and scared as he had watched from the Slytherin stands, unable even to breathe until the spell was broken, but Hermione had informed them later on that she had seen Snape cast, and Draco couldn\u2019t even bring himself to be surprised about that turn of events.\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, Hagrid, it was Snape!\u201d Hermione insisted as they had gathered in the gamekeeper\u2019s hut after the match for a cup of tea. \u201cI can recognise an incantation if I see it! He-\u201d\n\u201cRubbish!\u201d Hagrid interrupted him. \u201cWhy would he do something like tha'?\u201d\nHarry exchanged a meaningful look with Hermione and Weasley, and Draco prayed inwardly for the other boy to keep his mouth shut. No such luck.\n\u201cI found out something about him,\u201d Harry explained. \u201cHe tried to get past that three-headed-dog at Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it\u2019s guarding.\u201d\nDraco closed his eyes and waited for the lecture on not accusing teachers of such crimes, but it did not come. Instead, he heard a cup crash to the ground as Hagrid gasped: \u201cHow do yeh know about Fluffy?!\u201d\n\u201cFluffy?!\u201d Draco repeated incredulously, opening his eyes again. His reaction was mirrored by the others.\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s mine!,\u201d Hagrid told them. \u201cI bought him off a greek chappie I met in the pub last year! I leant him to Dumbledore ter guard the-\u201d\nHe cut himself off at that point, becoming aware of his almost-slip up. The other three kept prodding at him, arguing with him that Snape could not be trusted. Draco did all he could not to roll his eyes at them.\n\u201cNow, really,\u201d he cut into their argument, choosing his words well. \u201cStop harassing Hagrid like that! The Headmaster has put his trust in him, and he won\u2019t break it for us.\u201d\nWeasley stared at him with an open mouth and Harry frowned in confusion, but Hagrid beamed at Draco.\n\u201cYeh\u2019re a good boy, Draco!\u201d he boomed. \u201cTha's righ'! What the dog is hidin\u2019 is between Dumbledore an\u2019 Nicholas Flamel! It\u2019s none of yer business.\u201d\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Draco said quickly, before the others could even gasp. \u201cI\u2019ve read about Nicholas Flamel, and he\u2019s an important Alchemist. For all we know, Fluffy could be hiding the Philosopher\u2019s Stone! What good would such information do First Year\u2019s like us?\u201d\n\u201cSee!\u201d Hagrid nodded, throwing a placating look towards the other three. \u201cTha\u2019s what I was sayin\u2019! I mean, -\u201d Then he held in, his dark eyes widening at Draco, who smiled innocently over his cup of tea. \u201cCrickey,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI should never have said anythin\u2019.\u201d\nAnd that was why, though his Gryffindor friends were bigger meddlers than Draco would ever be, they would never be as good at it as a Slytherin.\n\n\n\u201cWhat is the Philosopher\u2019s Stone?\u201d Harry asked Draco eagerly as they made their way back up to the castle, having been released by a worried and guilty Hagrid under vows to not tell anyone about what they had just heard. \u201cAnd how do you know about it?\u201d\n\u201cI read,\u201d Draco said smugly, noting how Weasley rolled his eyes and Hermione looked slightly abashed, as if realizing she had to do more reading if there were things Draco knew and she didn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked Alchemy, so I\u2019ve read a lot about it. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is a legendary substance that can turn metal to gold, and that is used to create the Elixir of Life, which can make you immortal. Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of it, so it wasn\u2019t hard to guess what that dog is hiding once he\u2019d name-dropped him,\u201d Draco finished off-handedly.\n\u201cThe Elixir of Life!\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cThat means Snape is after immortality?\u201d\n\u201cEither that, or after gold,\u201d Draco shrugged, frowning. \u201cWho knows? If he\u2019s really old pals with Father\u2026\u201d He did not finish the sentence, but they all knew what he had meant to say - the possibility that Snape was no stranger to the Dark Arts was high if he frequented in the same circles as the Malfoy family.\n\u201cPercy said Snape has always been after the Defence Against The Dark Arts job,\u201d Harry noted. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why Dumbledore doesn\u2019t trust him enough to give it to him?\u201d\n\u201cWell, maybe he should not trust him enough to let him teach at all,\u201d Weasley noted drily. \u201cNot to mention let him live in the same building where he happens to hide something so bloody important.\u201d\nDraco quite agreed with Weasley, but he wasn\u2019t going to give him the satisfaction of saying it out loud.\n\n\nThankfully, as November turned into December and the castle was showered in Christmas decoration, Snape refrained from throwing Harry off brooms or making himself look more suspicious than he already was, so Draco could mostly focus on his studies and simply having fun with his friends instead of babysitting the trouble-seeking Gryffindors. When lists were hung up in their common rooms for people staying at Hogwarts over the holidays to sign in, though, Draco started to get nervous. The source of his nerves did not lie with the fact that Harry was staying with Weasley as company - jealous as he might tend to get of the redhead, he did not wish for Harry to spend Christmas completely alone - but the prospect of actually facing his parents after the turn his way of thinking had taken in the last couple of months was undoubtedly a cause of worry.\nDraco had been carefully raised into obedience by his father, and if not for his letter from the future and his consequent friendship with Harry and now even Hermione, he would have never dared to question him. He had always known that the consequences wouldn\u2019t be pretty.\nBut now, he was friends with the very same boy that had been the downfall of the evil overlord his father had worshipped, a Muggle-born girl and the youngest son of the most prominent blood traitor family that had ever made it into his father\u2019s books, and Draco was quite sure that would not go over well.\n\u201cYou could stay over Christmas, too,\u201d Harry suggested, when Draco voiced his worries to him a few nights before the holidays, while Weasley was exasperatedly trying to teach Hermione to play proper chess a few seats further down the Gryffindor table after dinner.\n\u201cMy parents would never allow it,\u201d Draco grimaced. \u201cMother will insist on having me home.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d Harry sighed. \u201cMaybe it won\u2019t be as bad as you think? Your mother doesn\u2019t seem all that horrible.\u201d Draco had to smile at that. The weekly packages of sweets she was sending him via Aquila were infamous between him and Weasley.\n\u201cMother is very affectionate,\u201d Draco conceded, his stomach churning at the idea of disappointing her. \u201cDon\u2019t expect that to continue once she realises I\u2019m friends with Muggleborns and Blood Traitors, though.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s your mother, though,\u201d Harry insisted, frowning. \u201cI\u2019m sure she won\u2019t stop loving you over the friends you made!\u201d\nDraco stayed silent, instead idly playing with the fir sprigs that decorated the house tables. Draco had quickly realised that, seeing as Harry had never really got to know his parents, the boy tended to idealise parent-child-relationships. And Draco was acutely aware of how insensitive it would be to argue with him; after all, he should be thankful that his parents were alive and able to show such interest in him. He knew that, to Harry, this fact alone seemed something like a dream.\nThen again, Harry\u2019s parents hadn\u2019t been bigoted pureblood elitists that had sided with the murderer who had tried to kill his best friend.\nAs he sat in the Hogwarts Express a couple of days later, he was a nervous wreck. Hermione did her best to try and distract him, but nothing held his attention for more than a couple of minutes, and the closer they got to London, the more he had to concentrate on keeping his breakfast in.\n\u201cMaybe they haven\u2019t heard anything about who your friends are?\u201d Hermione pointed out in a valid attempt at being helpful. \u201cThere\u2019s really no need to tell them, is there?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how families like mine work,\u201d Draco sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a network based on Pureblood Ideals. They all talk. \u2018Did you hear my daughter got top marks in Potions?\u2019, \u2018Did you hear my son made the Quidditch Team?\u2019, \u2018So, I heard your son befriended Muggle-borns and Blood Traitors. You must be so proud.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWhy do they care so much?\u201d Hermione sighed in frustration. \u201cI mean, as long as you\u2019re happy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s what they believe in,\u201d Draco muttered. \u201cAnd my grandparents believed it before them, and my great-grandparents before them. It\u2019s tradition, and my folks don't like change.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a racist tradition, though,\u201d Hermione grumbled.\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Draco agreed. \u201cBut what can I do? Is there nothing comparable in the Muggle world?\u201d\n\u201cThere is,\u201d Hermione conceded, resigned. \u201cOnly they base it on the colour of skin. The darker the skin, the bigger is the prejudice to certain people.\u201d\n\u201cWell, imagine my parents are those kind of people, and you three have the darkest skin colour imaginable,\u201d Draco said moodily.\n\u201cThat comparison doesn\u2019t really endear your family to me,\u201d Hermione noted.\n\u201cOh, believe me,\u201d Draco chuckled darkly. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my intention.\u201d\nAs they finally arrived at King\u2019s Cross and left the train, Draco quickly spotted his parents among a vast group of people: The Crabbes, the Goyles, and the Notts, as far as Draco could tell. His heart fell when he saw Nott already among them, talking fast and laughing derisively in a way that Draco could hear even from where he stood. His father was listening intently, face darkening with every word.\nHis mother was the first to spot Draco. Their eyes met, and she just looked at him, her lips tightening to a hard line. Her expression was hard to read, and before Draco had time to try, his father followed her gaze, and there was no mistaking his expression for silent fury.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you in the new year,\u201d Draco sighed, flashing a look at Hermione, who was biting her lip and was wearing a troubled frown. \u201cThat is, if I survive that long.\u201d\nHermione seemed as if she wanted to say something encouraging, but with a glance towards Draco\u2019s father, she shut her mouth again. Instead, she said softly: \u201cHave a nice Christmas.\u201d\nDraco wanted to laugh, but his face wouldn\u2019t comply. So he just waved at her and wrapped his fingers around the handle of his trunk, pulling it after himself as he made his way over to his parents.\n\n\n\u201cRonald Weasley,\u201d his father repeated, for the millionth time from the other side of the table, grey eyes burning into his with the force of liquid metal. \u201cHarry Potter is one thing - the world loves him and associating with him can come in handy. I can see that. But the Weasley boy?! Not to mention the Mudblood!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call her that,\u201d Draco muttered, though his voice was shaking slightly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare talk back to me, Draco!\u201d his father thundered. \u201cBy Salazar, you\u2019re the heir of the Malfoy family! Our family\u2019s Pureblood Status can be traced back for centuries! Us Malfoys don\u2019t associate with riffraff like the Weasleys or Muggles!\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a Muggle!\u201d Draco insisted, a little louder now. \u201cShe\u2019s a witch and she\u2019s bloody brilliant! Weasley may be an oaf, but of the many faults he has, the fact that his family doesn\u2019t think Muggles are scum is not one of them!\u201d\nThere was a moment of silence, and then, Draco found himself smacked right into the face. He was too stunned to react, or even to feel pain. Only when he heard his mother\u2019s loud voice did he snap out of his shock.\n\u201cLucius!\u201d she bellowed, in a tone which he had never heard from her before. \u201cRaise your hand against our son one more time and I swear you will regret it!\u201d\n\u201cDid you hear what he just said?!\u201d his father shouted. \u201cNot only was he sassing me, but he was-\u201d\n\u201cI have ears!\u201d his mother interrupted him. \u201cStill, I will not tolerate violence against him! Not for any reason, Lucius!\u201d\nHis father\u2019s shoulders were rigidly tensed and his jaw was working furiously, but he fell silent under the gaze of his wife. Finally, his mother\u2019s clear blue eyes fell on Draco, and some of the fierceness left them.\n\u201cGo up to your room, Draco,\u201d she ordered, much softer. \u201cI have to talk to your father. I will come up later.\u201d\nDraco nodded, feeling numb as he stood. His cheek was stinging painfully now, but he ignored it as he left his room and made his way up the stairs.\nThe house elves had brought Aquila and his trunk up to his room already. The owl was sitting on a perch near the window, hooting gently as he entered. Mutely, he walked over to pet his feathers.\nIt took about half an hour until his mother came up to see him. She knocked on the door softly, and when he called her in, she looked tired and grim.\n\u201cLet\u2019s sit,\u201d she suggested, and Draco nodded as he joined her in the elegant sitting corner near the door. Only now he noticed that the elves had left hot tea under a stasis charm on the couch table, and his mother moved to pour them each a cup as they made themselves comfortable on the three-piece suite.\n\u201cHere,\u201d she said, giving him his cup and holding in for a moment as she caught sight of his face. She reached out to stroke a gentle finger over his bruised cheek, her eyes troubled. Then, she got out her wand and cast a quick healing spell. The pain immediately receded, though the skin still felt warm from the magic.\n\u201cTell me about your friends,\u201d she demanded, at last. \u201cI want to hear about them.\u201d\nDraco gulped, and after a short moment of hesitation, he dove into a monologue about how he had met Harry at Diagon Alley, and how much Draco had wanted to be his friend. How he had met him again on the Hogwarts Express, this time with Weasley at his side. How Nott had turned all Slytherin\u2019s against him (he left out the details of their abuse, too ashamed to admit to such weakness in front of his mother) and how Harry had stuck up for him. He skimmed over the details of how Hermione had joined their group and told her instead about how smart the Muggle-born girl was and how he genuinely liked her, despite her non-magical heritage. By the time he had finished, his mother\u2019s eyes were thoughtful, and she was observing him carefully.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s not what you wanted for me,\u201d Draco concluded, his voice rough now. \u201cBut they\u2019re my friends, and they\u2019re important to me! Maybe not Weasley, so much. I could do without Weasley. But Harry and Hermione.\u201d\nHis mother\u2019s lips curled into almost a smile then. There was a moment of silence, in which Draco took a nervous sip of his tea, before she finally spoke.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that you seem to have found people who care about you, and who are looking out for you,\u201d she said softly. \u201cEspecially when your house mates seem to be less than welcoming. I\u2019m alarmed at Theodore\u2019s behavior, though I suppose it shouldn't come as a surprise. You two have never gotten along very well.\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s an understatement,\u201d Draco muttered. His mother chuckled, taking a sip of her own tea.\n\u201cIf you think these children are worth befriending, and if they treat you well, I am not going to oppose your acquaintance with them,\u201d she said, at last. \u201cI trust your judgement, darling, and I want you to be happy. Just let me deal with your father.\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t ever be alright with this,\u201d Draco reminded her. \u201cYou realise that, right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d she ensured him. \u201cBut you\u2019re your own person, and it\u2019s your decision to make. Your father and I might not always know what is best for you, as much as we\u2019d like to think otherwise. You won\u2019t be the first boy to go against your parents' expectations, and you surely won\u2019t be the last. Times change, and your ideals might be different from our's. It will be on us to find a way to deal with that. Don\u2019t let it be your worry.\u201d\n\u201cSo you really aren\u2019t angry with me?\u201d Draco checked, his throat tight.\n\u201cOh, darling,\u201d his mother whispered as she pushed his fringe off his forehead in an affectionate gesture. \u201cIf every mother condemned her son over a generational conflict, there would be disowned eleven-year-olds all over Hogwarts.\u201d\nDraco had to laugh at that, and suddenly, he felt very light, as if the entire weight of his worries had been lifted off his shoulders all at once. As long as his mother was on his side, Draco figured, he could deal with his father\u2019s rage. \n\u201cOkay, let me summarise,\u201d Draco groaned, holding up one hand to stop Harry from babbling on and using the other to rub soothing circles into his painfully thumping temples. \u201cWhile I was gone - which wasn\u2019t, as I\u2019d like to point out again, more than two weeks - you managed to get your hands on an invisibility cloak that used to belong to your father, roam the school at night, find a mirror that showed you your heart\u2019s deepest desire, and run into Dumbledore while at it without getting expelled?\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Harry returned, grinning sheepishly. \u201cThat sounds about right?\u201d\n\u201cWhy am I friends with you?\u201d Draco asked, to no one in particular.\n\u201cBecause you like me,\u201d Harry chuckled. \u201cOr at least, I think you do. It\u2019s hard to tell, with the way you complain all the time.\u201d\n\u201cHilarious,\u201d Draco snorted. He took a deep breath. \u201cI guess a good friend would now hold you a lecture about how dangerous all of this was and how lucky you are. But I\u2019m sure Hermione already did her share, so I\u2019m going to drop it.\u201d\n\u201cHow kind of you,\u201d Harry noted, his grin revealing how seriously he took Draco at the moment, which was not at all. Draco tried to feel offended, but couldn\u2019t bring himself to.\n\u201cI guess I should be relieved,\u201d Draco mused. \u201cI fully expected to come back to new conspiracy theories about Snape.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Harry frowned, pursing his lips. \u201cHe\u2019s not tried to kill me again, or to steal whatever Fluffy\u2019s hiding, as far as we can tell.\u201d\n\u201cThank Merlin for that,\u201d Draco noted, half sarcastic, half honest.\n\u201cHow about you?\u201d Harry asked, reaching for another Christmas chocolate that Draco had brought him from the Manor. \u201cI see your Dad hasn\u2019t killed you, either?\u201d\n\u201cOnly because Mother would murder him if he tried,\u201d Draco sighed. \u201cYou should have seen his face when I said that I didn\u2019t think being Muggleborn was a bad thing, or that the Weasley family wasn\u2019t scum.\u201d\nHarry made a face as he chewed his chocolate. When he\u2019d swallowed, he prodded: \u201cBut your Mum is okay with it?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco smiled. \u201cShe said she trusts my judgment.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Harry replied, returning the smile.\n\n\nAs January passed and turned into February, things stayed calm for the most part, and Draco was fairly hopeful that Snape had given up his crazy plan in fear of getting caught. He was still over-the-top mean to Harry, of course, but as infuriating as Snape\u2019s behaviour was, it was hardly life-threatening in any way.\nIt was in February, though, when Snape was announced as a referee for Gryffindor\u2019s second match of the season, that all their prior worries crashed back down on them. While Draco knew that Hermione and Weasley\u2019s immediate advice - for Harry to not play - was not going to do any good with their stubborn friend, he shared their fear that Snape might be refereeing just for the sake of getting rid of the danger that Harry presented.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t do much in front of Dumbledore,\u201d Draco still tried to reason with them (and maybe a little with himself). \u201cIt\u2019s one thing when he\u2019s part of the crowd, but as referee, he\u2019ll be in the centre of attention. It would be stupid of him to try and off Harry that publicly.\u201d\nHe knew, though, that, despite Harry's outward agreement with him, his words did nothing to quench their nervousness. The whole school seemed to be buzzing with excitement over the match, seeing as with a victory, Gryffindor might be able to overtake Slytherin in the house championship: The Slytherins, including Snape, seemed to become even more vicious towards every Gryffindor they crossed, as if they could intimidate the one house known for its bravery with sheer antagonism. Draco, seeing as he was the only Slytherin who really didn\u2019t care about the house championship (the importance of it paled a little in comparison to his best friend\u2019s safety), got his good amount of heat, too, but he was so used to it that he was barely bothered. The Gryffindors, on the other hand, were in equal measures determined to grab their chance and apathetic of Snape\u2019s refereeing.\nDraco decided to attend the match on the Gryffindor stands with Hermione and Weasley, where, despite some suspicious looks, he was mostly left in peace. He guessed that most of Harry\u2019s housemates were aware of their friendship, and knew he wasn\u2019t there to gloat or start trouble.\n\u201cWhy do you have your wands drawn?\u201d Longbottom asked them in confusion, and Draco exchanged a quick look with the other two.\n\u201cPracticing wand movements,\u201d he lied smoothly, and Hermione nodded, smiling brightly.\nLongbottom looked confused, but he did not question them further.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Weasley muttered when he had turned to talk to Thomas and Finnigan. \u201cAny funny business from Snape, and we\u2019ll send the Leg-Locker Curse straight at him.\u201d Draco and Hermione nodded, expressions grim.\n\u201cRight. Be sure to remember the incantation, it\u2019s-\u201d\n\u201cWe know the incantation, Hermione!\u201d Draco interrupted her, anxious as the teams filed onto the field. \u201cPlease, just do us a favour and be quiet!\u201d\nIt turned out they need not have bothered, though - it took merely more than a minute before Harry dived to the ground with intent, and caught the Snitch, giving Snape barely enough time to reward an undeserved penalty to Hufflepuff. All of a sudden, Draco found himself enveloped in unbridled Gryffindor euphoria, and he couldn\u2019t help but grin along with them, because who cared if Slytherin had lost the lead for the stupid house cup; Harry was safe and sound, and that was all that mattered.\nSeeing how everything had gone splendidly, they had not expected Harry to look frantic when he finally caught up with them after the match. He interrupted Weasley\u2019s happy babbling with a sharp: \u201cNevermind that now! Let\u2019s find an empty room! You wait till you hear this!\u201d and dragged them off towards an unused classroom before he dived into a story about some encounter between Snape and Quirrell that Harry had happened to overhear. Draco did not dare ask how he had gotten close enough to spy on the teachers - Draco had a feeling he did not want to know - but he was mildly alarmed as Harry revealed the content of their talk to be the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.\n\u201cSo we were right!\u201d Harry hissed. \u201cIt is the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, and Snape is trying to force Quirrell to help him get it! He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy. He said something about Quirrel\u2019s \u2018hocus-pocus\u2019, so I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy - lots of enchantments, probably - and Quirrell would have done some anti-dark arts spell Snape needs to break through!\u201d\n\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Draco muttered, feeling another headache on its way.\n\u201cSo you mean the stone\u2019s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?\u201d Hermione asked in alarm.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be gone by next Tuesday,\u201d Weasley scoffed.\n\u201cNow, now,\u201d Draco threw in, trying to reason with the others. \u201cWe might be underestimating Quirrell there!\u201d When the other three only looked at him with raised eyebrows, he added: \u201cYes, sure, he seems like a barmy coward most of the time, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s stood up to more danger than Snape, or Dumbledore wouldn\u2019t have hired him! And if Snape really threatens him, he can always go to Dumbledore for help!\u201d His words were met with a dubious silence, but Draco insisted: \u201cIt will be fine! I\u2019m sure Dumbledore knows what he\u2019s doing! In any way, it\u2019s better if we stay out of this!\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Hermione said slowly, biting her lip. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we can do much, really. Who will believe us if we blame Snape without any proof?\u201d\n\u201cExactly!,\u201d Draco nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re not even supposed to know the bloody thing\u2019s in the school! Let\u2019s just stay out of this before we get in trouble!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d Harry muttered darkly.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like it,\u201d Draco shot back. \u201cJust don\u2019t stalk Snape trying to find out what he\u2019s up to!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not stalking Snape!,\u201d Harry protested, but he looked satisfactory abashed and let the subject drop, much to Draco\u2019s relief.\n\n\nThankfully, as the exams drew closer, neither of them had much time to think about Snape or the Philosopher\u2019s Stone: Their homework began to increase drastically and Hermione fell into some kind of revision frenzy, pulling the boys down with her. Draco did not mind much - he spent every night in the Slytherin dorms studying as it was - but especially Weasley was complaining on top of his lungs, and Harry, Draco soon realized, did not have much patience for focused revision, either. Draco, who was much more patient with him than Hermione, tried to help out as best as he could, but it became easy to tell whenever those green eyes lost their focus and his mind wandered somewhere far from all their school work.\nOne of those afternoons spent in the library was interrupted by a shifty-looking Hagrid who had been trying desperately to hide the book about dragons he had checked out from their sight. Even Draco would not have believed his own feeble suggestion that maybe Hagrid was just interested in the topic - the caretaker was anything but the studious type - so he followed the others down to his hut after dinner to investigate.\n\u201cWe can also ask Hagrid about the enchantments hiding the stone!\u201d Harry suggested. Draco groaned inwardly.\nThe curtains of Hagrid\u2019s hut were closed tightly as they arrived, and when Hagrid had ushered them in after they had knocked, they entered what resembled a volcanic cave, judging by the temperature.\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d Draco groaned, immediately removing his robes. \u201cIt\u2019s practically summer! What do you have the fire lit for?\u201d\nHagrid just muttered something incomprehensible and offered them tea. As Harry eagerly started to question Hagrid about the safety measures concerning the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, though, Draco was only listening with one ear. His attention kept drifting to the fire, first out of annoyance, then, once he had noticed a strange black shape in its midst, out of curiosity.\n\u201cCome on, Hagrid,\u201d Hermione said in a smooth voice. \u201cYou might not want to tell us, but you do know! You know everything that goes on around here!\u201d\nDraco stifled a laugh at Hermione\u2019s tactic of flattery, proud to see that she\u2019d learned, and used the moment Hagrid cracked to get to his feet unnoticed.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d Hagrid said. \u201cHe borrowed Fluffy from me, then some o\u2019 the teachers did enchantments - Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick, Professor McGonagall, Professor Quirrell, an\u2019 Dumbledore did somethin\u2019 himself, o\u2019 course\u2026\u201d Draco quietly strolled over to the fire. \u201cHang on, I\u2019ve forgotten someone... Oh, yeah, an\u2019 Professor Snape!\u201d\n\u201cSnape?!\u201d Harry called incredulous, in the same moment that Draco glanced at the dark shape within the fire.\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d Draco squeaked, in a voice much too high. \u201cWhy is there a dragon egg in your fire?!\u201d\nHagrid jumped up at that, eyes wide and guilty.\n\u201cEhm,\u201d Hagrid stammered. \u201cTha\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhere the bloody hell did you get a dragon egg, Hagrid?\u201d Weasley asked, joining Draco by the fire and looking down at it in what was more interest than alarm. \u201cMust have cost you a fortune!\u201d\nHagrid then proudly dove into the story of how he\u2019d won the egg last night on a drink in the village and explained happily to them how he planned to hatch the egg and raise the dragon. Hermione, at least, Draco was glad to note, seemed as shocked about this as he was.\n\u201cHagrid, you live in a wooden house!\u201d she pointed out.\n\u201cNot only that!\u201d Draco added. \u201cYou live a ten minutes walk from a school! Not only is it dangerous, but everyone could happen across it and report you to the Ministry! You know that dragon breeding isn\u2019t allowed in Britain!\u201d\n\u201cNo one knew abou\u2019 Fluffy, either,\u201d Hagrid said airily.\n\u201cApart from us, you mean,\u201d he noted drily, but he could tell it was no use: Hagrid had that blissful sparkle in his eyes that Draco associated with expectant mothers.\n\n\nWhile Hagrid\u2019s secret gave them something new to worry about and distracted Harry satisfactorily from the stone, Draco now lived in constant fear of the news that their friend had been found out and fired. Befriending Gryffindors, he decided, had been a disastrous life choice for his nerves. One day he would snap and he\u2019d have only his trouble-seeking, evil-teachers-crossing and dragon-hatching friends to blame for it. When the future Draco had pushed him towards Harry, he surely hadn\u2019t known what the other boy would end up pulling him into, or he might have reconsidered.\nIt was a warm morning towards the end of April when Norbert, the baby Norwegian Ridgeback, hatched. Draco, who had always thought he possessed a certain affinity towards the creatures who had been his namesakes (or at least, the namesakes for the constellation he was named after), quickly changed his mind: Dragons might be fierce and majestic and nice to look at from afar, but he wanted none of them within a mile\u2019s distance of him, thank you very much. Norbert hissed and bit and spit fire at them, but no matter how much they tried to convince Hagrid to just let Norbert go, he would not hear of it.\n\u201cHe\u2019s too small, he\u2019d die,\u201d Hagrid insisted, even though Draco, after Norbert had snapped for his fingers more than once and singed his robes, was pretty sure that the rapidly growing creature could watch out for himself.\nIn the end, when Harry suggested contacting Charlie, the Weasley\u2019s second oldest working with dragons in Romania, Hagrid finally agreed. Thankfully, Charlie was as much of a Gryffindor as his brother, because he agreed to send some friends over to pick up the dragon at midnight on Saturday if they could bring him up to the tallest tower of Hogwarts.\n\u201cI\u2019m coming along,\u201d Draco announced the moment Harry told him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s better if you don\u2019t,\u201d Harry frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s already dangerous as it is, but the more people we are, the bigger the possibility of something going wrong.\u201d\nDraco bristled immediately at those words. The only thing worse than his Gryffindor friends getting him into trouble was them getting themselves into trouble without him.\n\u201cI see,\u201d he glared. \u201cSo this is another Gryffindors only thing of yours.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not it!\u201d Harry groaned. \u201cIt\u2019s just - it\u2019s Ron\u2019s brother, and you don\u2019t need to get involved! It\u2019s-\u201d\n\u201cIf you say \u2018It\u2019s got nothing to do with you\u2019, I\u2019ll hex you!\u201d Draco warned. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who cares about Hagrid!\u201d\nHarry looked at him pleadingly.\n\u201cI know you care,\u201d Harry ensured him. \u201cNo one ever doubted you did. But we\u2019d have to go all the way to the dungeons to pick you up with the invisibility cloak, and-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll just wait at Hagrid\u2019s,\u201d Draco shrugged, jaw set in determination. \u201cYou can pick me and Norbert up together.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d spend a whole night with Hagrid and Norbert just so we can take you along on a nightly trip to the highest tower that might get us expelled if we\u2019re found out?\u201d Harry demanded, an edge to his voice.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco returned stubbornly. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll do. Because without me, you will end up getting yourself expelled, and I won\u2019t stand for that!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve snuck out plenty of times without you before,\u201d Harry countered petulantly.\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Draco rolled his eyes. \u201cThe time when Nott almost lured you into Filch\u2019s arms, and that one time when Dumbledore caught you in front of that funky mirror, if I remember correctly? Yes, you\u2019re truly an expert.\u201d\nHarry huffed, but he stopped fighting Draco, and it was better that he did, because Weasley, the oh-so-important-key to the operation, landed himself in hospital wing Saturday afternoon due to a bite on his hand, courtesy of Norbert, which meant he had to drop out of their mission. So Draco headed out for Hagrid\u2019s hut after dinner and suffered through hours of a teary, emotional Hagrid and a hissing and spitting Norbert. Draco had spent the last half hour preparing Norbert\u2019s travelling accommodations with Hagrid, including dead rats for him to snack, brandy, and an ugly teddy bear which Draco was sure would catch fire sometime throughout the journey, but that would not be his problem to deal with. When Harry knocked, it was only 20 minutes to midnight, meaning he was late.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry gasped as he entered the hut. \u201cPeeves.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you leave Hermione?,\u201d Draco asked, frowning at the absence of their bushy-haired friend.\n\u201cHow many people do you think this cloak can hide if we carry a basket?\u201d Harry rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just you and me, since you were so dead-set on coming.\u201d\nHagrid said his tearful goodbye before Harry and Draco heaved the crate containing the dragon up the tallest tower. The thing was ridiculously heavy, and had Draco not fought Harry so vehemently on coming along, he\u2019d have complained.\nFour of Charlie Weasley\u2019s friends swooped down on their broomsticks and collected Norbert, taking off again after a friendly chat. Harry and Draco watched in relief as they flew out of sight, proud of their achievement.\nEverything would have gone splendidly, if only they'd not run into Peeves on the way back. First Harry had almost forgotten the cloak due to his euphoria of having gotten rid of Norbert, but Draco had reminded him at the last moment. They could have as well left it up the tower, though, because Draco had ended up tripping over a bunch of crystal balls the poltergeist had nicked from the Divination classroom, sending both him and Harry crashing to the floor and causing the cloak to fall off their shoulders. As fate would have it, that had been the moment Filch had entered the room and caught them. He had woken Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape to punish them. Their spitting rage was only rivalled by how mad Draco was at himself. He had come along to make sure Harry did not end up in trouble, and in the end, he'd managed to ruin the whole mission by behaving like a klutz who could not watch where he was going! \nBy some stroke of luck, they did not get expelled, but 50 points were taken from each of them, and they got detention. Which, Draco realised, could have gone much, much worse, so he counted the small blessings, even as the Slytherin\u2019s bullied him ever so harshly once the story of who had lost them 50 points in one night reached them. The Gryffindors, being the house of trouble-loving adventurers they were, did not seem to care as much about the loss of points, especially in the light of them keeping their position on top of the house championship despite the loss, but Harry took the new wave of animosity against Draco more to heart than Draco did himself.\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let you come,\u201d Harry muttered as he helped Draco rinse out the scarlet paint that had been dumped onto Draco\u2019s robes between classes.\n\u201cAs if Hermione could have lived with you two losing 100 points for Gryffindor,\u201d Draco scoffed. \u201cAt least I\u2019m used to this. So no harm done.\u201d\n\u201cNo more meddling from now on,\u201d Harry swore to him with a huff. \u201cI won\u2019t get any of us in trouble anymore.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s your fault,\u201d Draco sighed. \u201cThough, mind you, I\u2019d appreciate some quiet. I doubt you can stay out of trouble if you tried, though.\u201d\n\u201cWell, watch me,\u201d Harry vowed, and, much to Draco\u2019s surprise, he seemed to be serious about it. When he overheard a conversation between Snape and Quirrell a few days later, suggesting that the latter might have cracked, Harry refused to investigate further or alert Dumbledore in fear of getting more people into trouble, and Draco thought that maybe, this whole ordeal had been worth something, after all.\n\n\nFor detention, they were called to the entrance hall to meet Filch at 11 o\u2019clock that night. Draco was the first to arrive, and he had to listen to Filch reminiscing about the punishments of the old days for a good five minutes before Harry finally joined them. Not that Filch stopped talking about his deep-rooted desire to cause students physical pain as he led them out of the castle, but at least, he had Harry to exchange annoyed looks with. Harry, though, seemed to feel far more nervous about their punishment than Draco, but his face lightened up when they met Hagrid. This did not go unnoticed by Filch.\n\u201cI suppose you think you\u2019ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf?\u201d he sneered. \u201cWell, think again, boy! It\u2019s into the forest you\u2019re going, and I\u2019m much mistaken if you\u2019ll all come out in one piece!\u201d\nThis made Draco whirl around to stare at the caretaker, all his calmness gone.\n\u201cThe forest?!\u201d he called. \u201cWe can\u2019t go in there at night! There\u2019s all sorts of things in there! Werewolves, I heard!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s your lookout, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Filch said cheerfully, thoroughly enjoying himself. \u201cShould\u2019ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\nDraco tried to catch Harry\u2019s eyes in panic, but the other boy was looking at Hagrid, who was approaching them in fast steps with Fang at his heels. Draco noted, with rising panic, that he was armed.\nHagrid sent off the caretaker gruffly and finally turned to Harry and Draco.\n\u201cTell me he wasn\u2019t serious,\u201d Draco pleaded. \u201cTell me we\u2019re not going into the forest!\u201d\n\u201cAfrai\u2019 we are, Draco,\u201d Hagrid said grimly.\n\u201cBut-\u201d Draco began, though he held in when he felt Harry\u2019s hand on his elbow.\n\u201cNothing will happen to us when Hagrid is around,\u201d he told him, squeezing his arm in a soothing gesture. Then he turned back to Hagrid. \u201cWhat are we going to do in there?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m not goin\u2019 ter lie, it won\u2019t be a picnic,\u201d Hagrid grumbled. He walked towards the edge of the forest with them, and pointed down a dark path leading into it. The light of Hagrid\u2019s lamp shone ahead, though it did not help as much as Draco would have liked it to. \u201cLook there! See tha' stuff shinin' on the ground? Silvery stuff? Tha's unicorn blood.\u201d\n\u201cOh, now I feel much better,\u201d Draco muttered, receiving another squeeze from Harry, who had not removed his hand from Draco\u2019s arm as if fearing the Slytherin would take off running if he let go.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat,\u201d Hagrid continued, ignoring Draco. \u201cThis is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We\u2019re gonna try an\u2019 find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\u201d Draco asked, gulping.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothin' in tha' forest tha' will hurt yeh if yeh\u2019re with me or Fang,\u201d Hagrid said offhandedly, and Draco willed himself to believe him.\nAs they made their way into the dark forest, it was Draco\u2019s turn to hold onto Harry\u2019s arm. He hated this, he thought quietly. Why couldn\u2019t they just write lines or something? Have a normal detention? For a moment, he wondered what his parents would say if they knew what he was doing right now, but he pushed the thought away quickly. His father would probably think he deserved it for hanging out with the likes of Harry, Hermione and Weasley in the first place, and his mother would be so scandalised that she might still oppose to his friendship to them, after all.\nThey soon reached a crossing of ways, and Hagrid sent Draco and Harry to the left with Fang, while he took the path to the right. This did not help Draco\u2019s nerves, though Harry\u2019s alert calmness was a small comfort.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d Draco muttered, still holding onto Harry and peeking into the shadows obsessively. \u201cDo you feel like we\u2019re being watched? Because it does feel like that to me.\u201d\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Harry sighed, though he was too tense to be completely unaffected. \u201cIt will be fine. Hagrid wouldn\u2019t have taken us in here if he thought something might attack us.\u201d\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what the thing attacking unicorns is, though,\u201d Draco pointed out. \u201cUnicorns are fast. Much faster than we are.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have wands, though,\u201d Harry shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ve handled a Mountain Troll. I think we are safe.\u201d\n\u201cTrolls are stupid, though,\u201d Draco muttered, but when Harry glared at him, he fell silent.\nThey continued walking, carefully lighting their paths with their wands, but they came across nothing for a long time. Just when Draco was starting to hope that Hagrid would find and catch whatever was doing the killing without them, though, the traces of blood on the path before them increased, indicating that they were right on the tracks of the unicorn.\nIt was then, that they came across a clearing, and Harry shot out his arm to stop Draco.\n\u201cLook -\u201d he muttered, and Draco\u2019s eyes focused on the bright white figure of the unicorn lying on the ground. They took a few, careful steps closer, but the creature did not move, and Draco was pretty sure it was dead. He was just turning to Harry to point this out and suggest they send up green sparks to alert Hagrid, when something moved in the bushes on Harry\u2019s side, and they both froze.\nA hooded figure rose from the bush and stalked towards the unicorn, bending down until the face touched the wound of the unicorn and-\nOh, Merlin.\nDraco screamed. He used his hold on Harry\u2019s hand to pull him backwards, but Harry stumbled. Fang had started to run, whimpering as he did, and Draco wanted nothing more than to follow him, but Draco\u2019s scream had alerted the hooded figure, which had raised its head and was now watching them. Draco could not see its face; darkness hid it from his view. It rose to its feet again and moved over to them.\nDraco pulled at Harry\u2019s arm again, but the other let out a pained sound and only stumbled into Draco, seeming to lose his footing. Harry\u2019s hand had flown to his forehead and he was clutching it, his face screwed up in pain, though his eyes were wide and focused on the creature approaching them.\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Draco whimpered, pulling again, and then, the sound of hooves filled the air. Draco turned just in time to see another creature, this time four-legged, approach them in a wild gallop. Draco screamed again, and then pulled Harry to the ground, half-draping himself over his friend in a wild instinct.\nThe other creature jumped over them, and Draco closed his eyes. There was movement, but nothing touched them, and then, an eerie silence. When he dared to blink, the four-legged creature stood bent over them. With a gasp, he pushed Harry backwards, who made a sound of pained protest, but Draco just grabbed him and tried to crawl away in a desperate attempt to escape, to-\n\u201cThere is no need to be afraid,\u201d a clear, male voice said, and Draco froze, looking up.\nThe creature had the body of a palomino horse, but the body of a man. It stared at them with deep blue eyes and a worried expression.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a centaur,\u201d Draco breathed, still slightly hysterical. The man nodded.\nHarry looked up then, too, the painful grimace gone. His hand fell from his forehead, and he looked first at the centaur, then at Draco.\nAre you alright?\u201d the centaur asked, offering a hand both to Harry and to Draco.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry muttered, accepting the help, and only when Harry was back on his feet did Draco reach out to let himself be pulled from the ground, too. \u201cThank you. What was that?\u201d\nThe centaur did not answer. He only looked at Harry, observing him carefully. His eyes hung for a moment at Harry\u2019s scar.\n\u201cYou are the Potter boy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time - especially for you. Can you ride?,\u201d he looked from Harry to Draco and back again. \u201cIt will be quicker this way.\u201d\nThe centaur lowered himself onto his forelegs to allow them to mount him, and though Draco was weary - his parents had never spoken highly of centaurs - Harry showed no such reservations, swinging his legs over the centaur\u2019s back immediately. Draco had no choice but to follow, clinging to Harry tightly as he did.\n\u201cMy name is Firenze,\u201d the centaur informed them as he stood again, but then, the sound of more hooves approaching them made him halt. Two more centaurs were galloping towards them, one looking outraged and angry (a lot more like Draco had imagined the creatures to look), the other nervous and gloomy.\n\u201cFirenze!\u201d the first one called. \u201cWhat are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\u201d and then, they fell into a heated discussion which Draco could not follow very well. Harry\u2019s name was mentioned again, and the heavens, and the unicorn, and in the end, Firenze took off with them, angry and determined.\nHarry, feeling much more courageous than Draco, asked Firenze about the creature he had saved Harry and Draco from, and Firenze evaded the question, instead talking about the uses of unicorn blood, how the magical properties of the blood kept a person close to death alive, but cursed them in return.\n\u201cBut who\u2019d be that desperate?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be cursed forever, death\u2019s better, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Firenze agreed. \u201cUnless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else - something that will bring you back to full strength and power - something that will mean you can never die. Mr Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\u201d\n\u201cThe Philosopher\u2019s Stone!\u201d Harry gasped. \u201cOf course - the Elixir of Life! But I don\u2019t understand who-\u201d\n\u201cCan you really think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\u201d\nIt hit Draco at the same moment as it hit Harry, and he felt like he was going to be sick. For years, he had heard his father talk about the Dark Lord and how he had had the right ideas about purity of blood and the rule of true wizards, and he had made it all seem so glorious, like a sacred mission.\n\u201cYou cannot repeat any of this publicly,\u201d his father had told him, his eyes glinting. \u201cI swore in front of the Wizengamot that I revoked my ways, and I need to play my part. So do you. But I want you to know, Draco.\u201d  \nAnd Draco had believed it, all of it, until he had gotten that letter from the future. Until he had met Harry, who the Dark Lord had tried to kill along with his parents - a thought that made Draco feel even sicker. What if he had succeeded? He could not imagine his life without Harry. He had only known the boy for a couple of months, but he felt as integral to Draco\u2019s life now as nothing else.\nHe could not let the person who had tried to kill him come back to power. He could not let it happen. It would put Harry in danger all over again.\nThey found Hagrid then, and Firenze left them in his care. He directed some words of caution to Harry before he left, and Hagrid questioned Harry about what had happened, but Draco could not listen. His head was buzzing. He wondered, feebly, if this was what a panic attack felt like. He only stared at Harry as the other talked, gesturing with his hands, and felt a strange, overwhelming urge to grab him and run away with him. To hide him away from the world in a place where no one would ever find him.\nDraco knew then, clear as day, that he would do everything to protect Harry from harm. Even if it meant standing in the way of the Dark Lord\u2019s wand.\nTheir end of term exams passed in a blur of worry over Harry and the Dark Lord. Draco was watching Snape closely whenever he crossed his path, almost more obsessed with ensuring the man did not get to the Philosopher\u2019s Stone than Harry had been in the first place. Hermione and Weasley did not quite understand his fear. Hermione was sure that the Dark Lord would not dare to act right under Dumbledore\u2019s nose, and Weasley reckoned that Hagrid would rather jump into the lake and hug the giant squid than letting down the Headmaster.\nBut as much affection as Draco held for Hagrid, he had no illusions about the man\u2019s abilities to keep secrets: They had been able to tickle information out of him before, and Snape was much more experienced a Slytherin than Draco was. He figured that Hermione and Weasley just didn\u2019t grasp the whole extent of the danger, seeing that they had not been in that forest with them. Draco, though, could not get the hooded shape of the Dark Lord out of his head, and neither could Harry, it seemed. It was a good thing Draco had spent every night for the last couple of months studying, because otherwise, he was unsure how he would have passed any of his exams. Thankfully, though, he had, and the answers came easily to him once he tried to shut out the worry and fear long enough to concentrate.\nAfter his last exam, Transformation, he went out to join his Gryffindor friends outside by the lake. The weather was hot and they had decided to laze around outside after their respective exams and enjoy their newly won freedom (\u201cThat is, assuming I don\u2019t doze off on my History of Magic exam,\u201d Weasley had grumbled). He found them spread out on the grass, but just as he was approaching them, Harry suddenly jumped up, his eyes wide.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just thought of something,\u201d he could hear the other boy say, his voice unsettled. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\u201d And with that, he took off, right into the direction Draco was coming from.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Draco asked, but Harry just grabbed his arm and pulled him along. Behind them, Hermione and Weasley struggled to keep up.\n\u201cWhy, Harry?\u201d Hermione panted.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit odd,\u201d Harry called. \u201cthat what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it\u2019s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don\u2019t you think? Why didn\u2019t I see it before?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean,\u201d Draco gasped, his eyes widening. \u201cSnape?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s mouth was set in a grim line as he nodded, curtly, and they continued hurrying down the grass slope towards Hagrid\u2019s hut. When they reached it, Hagrid was sitting outside in an armchair, preparing ingredients for dinner.\n\u201cHullo,\u201d he called, smiling as he watched them approach. \u201cFinished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\u201d\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d Ron muttered, but Harry cut him off, getting straight to the point and asking Hagrid about the night he had acquired Norbert. Hagrid, after some prodding, told them that he had played a hooded man in cards for the egg and that he had talked to him about Hogwarts and the creatures he cared for here.\n\u201cHe had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn\u2019 want it ter go ter any old home\u2026\u201d Hagrid explained, frowning as he tried to remember. \u201cSo I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy\u2026\u201d\nDraco gaped at the giant gamekeeper with a sense of foreboding, and Harry asked, trying to sound casual: \u201cAnd did he - did he seem interested in Fluffy?\u201d\n\u201cWell - yeah - how many three-headed dogs d\u2019yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\u2019s a piece o\u2019 cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus\u2019 play him a bit o\u2019 music an\u2019 he\u2019ll go straight off ter sleep-\u201d He cut himself off with a look of horror that mirrored how Draco felt. \u201cI shouldn\u2019ta told yeh that!\u201d he called. \u201cForget I said it!\u201d\nBut Harry had already taken off running, and Draco, Hermione and Weasley struggled to keep up with him, ignoring Hagrid yelling after them. Only when they had reached the entrance hall did Harry stop and turn to face them.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go to Dumbledore!\" he announced, and Draco nodded eagerly.\n\u201cWe do!\u201d he agreed. \u201cToo many things have happened, and we can\u2019t let Snape get his hands on the stone!\u201d\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Harry replied, looking around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dumbledore\u2019s office?\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Draco said eloquently, blinking.\n\u201cWhat are you doing inside?\u201d a suspicious voice cut through their dialogue, and they whirled around the face Professor McGonagall frowning at them around a pile of books she was carrying.\n\u201cWe want to see Professor Dumbledore,\u201d Hermione answered, which seemed to make the Professor even more suspicious.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cProfessor,\u201d Draco said, stepping up. \u201cWe know this might sound strange, but we have reason to believe that someone has been poking around for information to get his hands on the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, and succeeded. And if nothing\u2019s done, this person will steal it and hand it to the Dark Lord and-\u201d and he will try to kill Harry, but Draco did not voice the last part, instead gulping and standing very straight, looking defiantly at their teacher, who was staring at him in open-mouthed shock, the books in her hands having crashed to the floor and splattered there.\n\u201cHow-\u201d she began, but Draco shook his head immediately.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how we know,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWhat matters now is that precautions are taken, and for that, we need to tell Professor Dumbledore what we know.\u201d\nMcGonagall stared at him long and hard, as if trying to read his mind, and reflexively, Draco tried to empty his head and fight down his emotions. It did not seem, though, like she was a Legilimens, because when she spoke, it was not in interrogation.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you found out about the stone,\u201d she began. \u201cbut rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it\u2019s too well protected.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s the thing!\u201d Draco called. \u201cSomeone found out how to get past your protections, and we need to tell-\u201d\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore received an urgent owl from the Ministry and flew off to London at once,\u201d she interrupted him. That made Draco hold in, eyes wide.\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone?\u201d he repeated, looking around to meet Harry\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cYes,\u201d McGonagall confirmed. \u201cHe will be back by tomorrow, so if you still feel the need to talk to him then-\u201d\n\u201cBut they might try tonight!\u201d Harry called. \u201cWhat if-\u201d\n\u201cPotter,\u201d McGonagall ground out impatiently. \u201cThere is no need to worry. Our protections have held for months, and they will hold another night. I know what I\u2019m talking about. Now,\u201d she said, bending down to pick up the books. \u201cI suggest you go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.\u201d\nDraco opened his mouth again, ready to fight her, but Hermione caught his arm and shook her head. It was only when McGonagall was out of earshot that they spoke again.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tonight,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cSnape\u2019s going through the trapdoor tonight.\u201d\n\u201cOf course he is,\u201d Draco murmured, a note of panic in his voice. \u201cHe orchestrated this all fabulously. Dumbledore out of the way, none of the other teachers suspecting a thing\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut what can we-\u201d Weasley began, though he stopped talking when Hermione gasped, staring, paralyzed, at something past Draco\u2019s right shoulder. He turned slowly, and his heart sank when he found himself face to face with none other than Snape.\nA thick silence fell upon them.\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d Snape said smoothly, observing them with his sharp, dark eyes. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be inside on a day like this.\"\n\u201cWe were-\u201d Harry began, but Draco stepped on his foot, silencing him. Snape looked from Harry to Draco, his eyes narrowing. Draco steeled himself, setting his jaw stubbornly and holding the gaze of his Head of House without backing down.\n\u201cYou want to be more careful,\u201d Snape said in a soft, dangerous voice that was laced with underlying threat. \u201cHanging around like this, people will think you are up to something.\u201d\nDraco pressed his lips tightly together, still not breaking their staring contest. I won\u2019t let you touch him, Draco thought, almost hoping that Snape, unlike McGonagall, would try to read his mind. \u201cBe warned,\u201d Snape continued, his eyes finally landing back on Harry, making Draco feel strangely satisfied. \u201cany more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day.\u201d\nAnd with that, he turned his back on them and walked away, disappearing into the staff room.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Harry muttered, turning back to them. \u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\nHe suggested for Hermione to stand guard by the staff room while they watched the third-floor-corridor, but Draco quickly waved him off.\n\u201cThis will never work,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cHermione can\u2019t just linger by the staff room forever, and someone will eventually catch us near the third-floor-corridor, especially after we spoke to McGonagall. Not to mention that Snape could dispose of us easily even if we blocked his way.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have a better idea, then?\u201d Harry demanded.\nDraco stayed silent, thinking. Two of his basic instinct battled with each other: His rational sense for survival, and the knowledge that, if they crossed Snape\u2019s path, it might not end well for them, versus the urgent need to protect Harry. He knew that they had to stop Snape before he got his hands on the stone and handed it to the Dark Lord - but what good would it do if they got themselves killed before they could achieve that?\n\u201cLet\u2019s write to Dumbledore,\u201d Draco suggested.\n\u201cThe letter might not reach him in time!\u201d Harry shook his head.\n\u201cAnd who says he\u2019ll believe us even if it did?\u201d Hermione muttered, biting her lip.\n\u201cThen we have to get to the stone before him,\u201d Draco said, almost to himself.\nEveryone blinked at him, perplexed.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cYou mean, we - yes,\u201d he took a deep breath, nodding. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We have to go.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how to get past the other enchantments, though,\u201d Draco reminded him, biting his lip. \u201cHow are we going to-\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to risk it,\u201d Harry shook his head.\n\u201cThese enchantments were done by teachers to stop a fully-skilled wizard from getting his hands on the stone, Harry,\u201d Hermione injected, her voice small. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually think we will be able to-\u201d\n\u201cWe won\u2019t know unless we try!\u201d Weasley insisted. \u201cMalfoy is right! We\u2019ll have to do it!\u201d\nDraco was not sure which part shook him the most - the fact that he had just suggested they\u2019d better head down a forbidden corridor to face a murderous three-headed dog and other dangerous and possibly deadly obstacles, or that Weasley had agreed with him.\n\n\nHarry, Hermione and Weasley had been all for going down at night, after everyone had gone to bed, but Draco had quickly talked them out of that. Snape would probably wait until nighttime, to make sure his colleagues wouldn\u2019t suspect anything, and if they wanted to be the first ones at the stone and not cross paths with him, they would have to go earlier. Therefore he convinced Harry to pick up his invisibility cloak so they could start right away. They waited for him in an abandoned classroom on the second floor and slipped under the cloak when he returned. They had to hunch to be able to all fit, to the point where Draco felt like he was waddling rather than walking, but sacrifices had to be made.\nIt was only when they neared the third-floor corridor, having made sure no teachers were around to see the door opening and closing, and Draco could hear the restless grumbling of Fluffy muffled through the wood, that Draco turned to Harry.\n\u201cHow are we going to get past Fluffy?\u201d he asked in a whisper. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any-\u201d But he trailed off when Harry held up a clumsily carved flute.\n\u201cChristmas present from Hagrid,\u201d he hissed, and Draco nodded.\nWeasley reached out to heave the door open, and they slipped inside, completely unnoticed by the rest of the castle.\nDraco had spent a lot of time imagining the monstrous dog from Harry\u2019s words, but somehow, standing before it, after all, he still felt unprepared. All three heads of the dog growled and sniffed at the air, searching for the intruders he could not see. Draco was glad that Harry didn\u2019t freeze the way Draco did - instead, he started playing the flute the moment the door had fallen closed behind him.\nDespite Harry\u2019s abysmal musical talent, the beast\u2019s eyes immediately dropped at the sound of the flute, and soon, it had stretched out on the floor, all three heads snoring softly, as if they were in competition with each other. Weasley warned Harry to keep playing as they approached the trap-door, and pulled it open. There was no telling what expected them underneath - there were no stairs, only pitch-black darkness.\nHarry insisted on being the one to go first, and he handed the flute to Hermione. As he started to lower himself, he warned them to not follow if anything happened to him - as if, Draco thought grimly - but to go and send Hedwig to Dumbledore instead. Then, he dropped.\nDraco leaned over the hole and waited, heart hammering, for any sign of life. There was a damp sound of collision, softer than Draco had expected, and some shuffling, before Harry called: \u201cIt\u2019s ok! It\u2019s a soft landing, you can jump!\u201d\nWeasley followed first, and Draco went second. Draco almost landed on Harry, and all three of them shuffled back to make room for Hermione to land.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Draco asked, frowning at the plant underneath them, which seemed to be moving, as if faintly angry at being disturbed. Before anyone could answer, though, Hermione had landed in front of them with a dull thumping sound.\n\u201cWe must be miles under the school,\u201d she muttered, breathless and anxious.\nIt was in that moment that Draco felt the tendrils of the plant sling around his wrist. He yelled and jumped up, pulling his arm to fight it off just in time. Hermione followed quickly, and they both backed up against the wall, escaping the plant with some effort, but it was too late for Harry and Weasley. They had been bound tightly by the plant\u2019s tendrils and seemed to be pulled under by it.\n\u201cStop moving!\u201d Hermione called at them from next to him. \u201cIt\u2019s a Devil\u2019s Snare!\u201d\nDraco cursed, panicked. He made a step forward, thoughtlessly, as if to pull Harry out with his bare hands, but Hermione clung to Draco\u2019s arm, holding him back. She was still shouting at them, and there were angry responses, but Draco could not listen to them. There was a rushing noise in his ears; a panic that drowned out everything else and made him unable to think.\nHe only snapped out of it when Hermione sent blue flames towards the plant, making it flinch away from their heat and allowing Harry and Weasley to free themselves and join them. They were panting, and Draco took deep, calming breaths as he slowly regained the feeling in his limbs.\n\u201cI hate this,\u201d he muttered, mostly to himself. No one heard him. Hermione and Weasley were too busy bickering, and they only stopped when Harry urged them along.\nThey walked down an empty stone passageway, and the complete silence and darkness felt oppressive to Draco. He balled his fingers into a fist to keep them from shaking. His eyes drifted to Harry, who was walking ahead of them, shoulders tense and alert, but emanating a calmness that reminded Draco of their detention in the forest. Draco wished, for a moment, that he had Harry\u2019s nerves or his courage. He felt stupid, trying to fight down what felt like a panic attack - this had been his idea, after all. But then again, the Sorting Hat hadn\u2019t put him into Slytherin for nothing. He had a strong sense of self-preservation. His deep-rooted response to danger was to run, not to face it with his head held high.\nBut he had no choice, he reminded himself. Harry\u2019s life was on the line.\n\u201cCan you hear something?\u201d Weasley whispered suddenly.\nThey all held in, listening. Soft, dull sounds filtered through the air, but before Draco could identify them, the others were already discussing in soft whispers.\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s a ghost?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 sounds like wings to me.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s light ahead - I can see something moving!\u201d\nThey entered a bright chamber with little, bird-like shapes flying across the room. They held in at the doorway, and Draco blinked against the brightness, his eyes slowly adjusting to the light as he tried to recognize the flying creatures. Harry and Weasley were muttering next to him, and Harry was getting ready to run across the room when Draco grasped his arm, stopping him.\n\u201cHarry,\u201d he muttered, pointing up. \u201cThose are keys!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry asked, following Draco\u2019s gaze and gasping. Hundreds of keys in various shapes and forms were fluttering over their heads, their feathery wings making them resemble birds unless you looked closely.\nDraco drew his eyes away from them, taking in the room. There was a wooden door on the other side, closed. Broomsticks were perched up against the wall beside it. It took no genius to figure out this one.\n\u201cOne of these keys opens the door,\u201d he said, pointing at the brooms. \u201cWe need to catch it.\u201d\n\u201cBut there are hundreds of them!\u201d Hermione pointed out.\nWeasley took a careful step forward, and when the keys took no note of him, he walked over to the door, examining the lock.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a big, old-fashioned one - probably silver, like the handle.\u201d\nIt was harder than Draco had expected. The keys were faster than any Snitch and dove into flight every time one of them grabbed for them. Harry made good use of his Seeker reflexes, though: He was the first to spot the large silver key with blue wings, and the four of them cornered it until Harry could snatch it from the air.\nIt was a perfect fit, and the door unlocked. Being up on a broom and focused on the search had calmed Draco\u2019s nerves a little, but they came back in full force as they stepped into the next room, which was too dark to make out anything in it. But as soon as they entered, the room lightened up, revealing a giant chessboard to their view.\nIt was pretty clear what they had to do here as well, and even Weasley understood immediately. The boy quickly took the lead, seeing as he was, arguably, the best chess player among them. They had to take the place of four black chess pieces - Hermione became a castle, Weasley a knight, and Harry and Draco took the positions of the two bishops. White started off the game, and Weasley played them across the room with remarkable skill. Draco paid close attention to his moves, especially when it became clear that the taken pieces were knocked out with the same violence that had always scandalized Hermione about Wizard\u2019s Chess, but Weasley played an impeccable game, and Draco found no fault in his strategy.\nIt was when they strived closer to victory, though, that Draco had to interfere for the first time.\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Weasley muttered, thoughtful and grim as his eyes skimmed over the board. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way\u2026 I\u2019ve got to be taken.\u201d\nHarry and Hermione yelled in protest, arguing with Weasley, but Draco scanned the board, going through every possibility in his head.\n\u201cThere\u2019s another way,\u201d he said suddenly, pointing to a stray pawn at his right.\n\u201cThat\u2019s too dangerous, Malfoy!\u201d groaned Weasley, glaring at him. \u201cThey might move the King, and then-\u201d\n\u201cLet them,\u201d Draco shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re in no hurry, are we? It\u2019s worth prolonging the game if we all come out unscathed.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to grasp the chance while it\u2019s there!\u201d Weasley protested heatedly. \u201cWe can\u2019t risk losing our dominant position!\u201d\n\u201cWe have time!\u201d Draco stressed. \u201cWe can afford to give away one chance. No one knows we\u2019re here, and it\u2019ll be hours before Snape can steal down here. Who knows what other things we\u2019ll have to face next! Those were four tasks, meaning there\u2019s three more ahead. We can\u2019t afford to lose anyone now.\u201d\nWeasley huffed, opening his mouth to argue back, but Harry cut him off.\n\u201cDraco is right!\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving up anyone unless we absolutely have to, Ron! Play the pawn!\u201d\nRon rolled his eyes, but at Harry\u2019s words, he retaliated. And it was worth it, in the end: It was a close call, and almost all their other pieces were lost, but Weasley managed to checkmate the black king about twenty minutes later. The giant chess pieces bowed in defeat and let the four of them pass, and they exited the room into the next dark passageway.\n\u201cWhat do you reckon is next?\u201d Harry asked, keeping his voice low.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had Sprout\u2019s, that was the Devil\u2019s Snare,\u201d Hermione muttered, counting the tasks down on her fingers. \u201cFlitwick must have put charms on the keys - McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive - that leaves Quirrell\u2019s spell, and Snape\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd Dumbledore\u2019s,\u201d Draco reminded her as they reached the next door. His nerves were tingling feebly again, but Draco pressed down on them decisively.\nHarry pushed the door open, and an overwhelming smell of rotten food greeted them. The smell pulled at Draco\u2019s memories, but before he could place it, an angry growl greeted them, and Draco screamed as they, once again, we\u2019re faced with an angry mountain troll.\n\u201cNot again,\u201d Weasley muttered faintly, and then, they had to duck as the troll swung its heavy club at them.\nIt was a team effort this time. Hermione levitated the club in an imitation of Weasley\u2019s move on Halloween. Harry kicked the troll when it went for Hermione, distracting it from attacking their friend, who let the club drop in shock. Draco stung the troll in the leg with fire, making it roar and let off Harry, turning to Draco instead. Which gave Weasley enough time to levitate the club a second time and knock the troll out with it before it could reach Draco.\n\u201cI should consider this as a professional career,\u201d Weasley noted, rather smugly, as they fled the room to escape the stench. \u201cI seem to be rather good at knocking out trolls.\u201d\nDraco opened his mouth to note that his success was probably down to his IQ being similar to a troll's, but he closed it again - not the moment for smart remarks, he decided. Especially not after Weasley had shown more use on their little mission than Draco had, realistically speaking. Instead, he focused his thoughts in another direction.\n\u201cWas that one Snape\u2019s?\u201d Draco asked, dubious. \u201cHe let the troll into the castle on Halloween, supposedly, and he wouldn\u2019t have bothered Quirrell about getting past a troll if-\u201d\nBut they reached the next door then, and he fell silent. Harry exchanged a look with them before he pulled it open. Inside, they found a dimly lit room, in its centre a table with a variety of potions perched on it.\n\u201cI think this one\u2019s Snape\u2019s,\u201d Harry pointed out, frowning. \u201cWhat do we have to do?\u201d\nDraco frowned, staring at the bottles, confused at this turn of events. With the way Snape had threatened Quirrell, he had expected a powerful curse from their Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor. Snape could have easily dealt with a troll. Something about this did not add up, and he was going to voice this as Harry stepped into the room.\nHermione yelped then and pulled both Draco and Weasley forward as well, just in time to escape the purple flames that suddenly sprang to life in the doorway. Draco scanned the room and saw that black flames were covering the doorway on the other side of the room, too.\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Weasley muttered. \u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\u201cLook!\u201d Hermione called, picking up a rolled parchment from the table. She unrolled it and read out a poem, but Draco, still too occupied with the matter of the troll, was unable to take it in fully.\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d Hermione said, obviously relieved, when she was done. \u201cThis isn\u2019t magic - it\u2019s logic - a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven\u2019t got an ounce of logic, they\u2019d be stuck in here forever.\u201d She then proceeded to solve the riddle, and Draco left her to it, strolling around, gazing into the fire and thinking.\nWhy had Quirrell chosen a troll in the first place, with the way he had obviously been frightened by the creature\u2019s entrance to the castle at Halloween? Wouldn\u2019t he have chosen something he could control and others couldn\u2019t, the way Hagrid had done? And wasn\u2019t it too much of a coincidence that two different teachers would choose trolls in matters regarding the Philosopher\u2019s Stone? Sure, if Snape had known about the troll, he might have stolen Quirrell\u2019s idea and used it as distraction to get to the stone himself on Halloween, but the fact that he had threatened Quirrell did not fit that picture. They were missing something here. What were they missing?\n\u201cGot it,\u201d Hermione announced, drawing Draco out of his mulling. \u201cThe smallest bottle will get us through the black fire - towards the stone.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s only enough for one of us,\u201d Harry pointed out. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly one swallow.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it will fill up again once one of us passed through?\u201d Ron asked hopefully.\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Hermione frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the point of this task that only one person can pass at a time. And we\u2019ll still be in here even when Harry leaves, which I assume the magic of this room must sense.\u201d\nThere was a moment of silence, before Harry asked: \u201cWhich one will get you back through the purple flames?\u201d Hermione pointed at one of the bottles. It was slightly bigger than the other one, enough that it could probably be divided between two or three people, if one was careful. Maybe it would even suffice for all four of them. \u201cI\u2019ll go in,\u201d Harry announced, taking a deep breath. \u201cYou wait here, and if I\u2019m not back in half an hour, you go up and write to Dumbledore.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Draco said immediately. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019re going alone.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other way!\u201d Harry argued. \u201cYou heard Hermione!\u201d\n\u201cBut-\u201d\n\u201cHarry\u2019s right, Draco,\u201d Hermione injected, biting her lip. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way. One of us needs to go, and Harry is probably best suited.\u201d\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Weasley nodded. \u201cLet Harry go.\u201d\nDraco gnawed at his bottom lip, trying to find some argument against this insanity. Under normal circumstances, he\u2019d have agreed. Harry kept a cool head in dangerous situations the way none of them did, least of all Draco, and while he was not as logical as Hermione or Draco, he was definitely more likely to see through any traps on his own than Weasley. Harry, though, was also the person Draco was most scared for, and the most likely to react impulsively, and therefore put his life at risk.\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Harry said softly, touching the Slytherin\u2019s shoulder and meeting his eyes. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come down here to make sure the Dark Lord can\u2019t get his hands on the stone to come back and hurt you,\u201d Draco reminded him in a tight voice. \u201cIt will have been for nothing if you get hurt while trying to protect it.\u201d\n\u201cNot only I will be in danger if Voldemort comes back to power,\u201d Harry muttered, making all three of them flinch at the usage of the name, but ignoring it. \u201cEveryone will be in danger. We can\u2019t just stand back and do nothing.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to sacrifice yourself!\u201d Draco hissed.\n\u201cI was aware of the dangers when I agreed to do this,\u201d Harry said with grim determination. \u201cI am okay with getting hurt if it means I can stop Voldemort from coming back. Aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nDraco gulped. Honestly, he did not know if he would have done this if Harry wasn\u2019t directly threatened. He was pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t have. He would have looked elsewhere and convinced himself the danger was not as immediate as it seemed. It was fear for Harry alone that had spurned him on. But when he looked over at Hermione and Weasley, he saw the same look of grim determination on their faces that Harry spotted.\nThe Gryffindors were all ready to sacrifice themselves for the greater good. Stupidly courageous and noble, the lot of them. They made Draco feel terribly selfish, for wanting to protect his friend over the rest of the world.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Draco said, very quietly. \u201cBut if you get yourself killed-\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do what? Kill me again?\u201d Harry asked, the corners of his lips twitching.\n\u201cI\u2019ll find a way to do it,\u201d Draco promised darkly. \u201cSlytherin, remember? We\u2019re very resourceful.\u201d\nHarry chuckled, a real smile spreading across his face. It made Draco smile back, if only reluctantly. Harry squeezed his shoulder once more, before turning back to the potions.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he nodded, picking up the tiny bottle. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d\nDraco watched nervously as the other boy drank the potion and made his way through the black fire. With a grin thrown at them over his shoulder, he opened the door, and then he was gone.\nThere was silence between the remaining three as they waited. Draco paced the room, kneading his fingers in nervousness. Weasley stared at the door Harry had disappeared through, not once moving his eyes away. Hermione was fumbling with the parchment, unrolling it to reread it and checking the potions, just for something to do.\n\u201cHermione,\u201d Draco said finally, willing his thoughts away from Harry and back to what had been bothering him earlier. \u201cCan we be sure that it was Snape who let in the troll on Halloween?\u201d\nHermione looked up at him in confusion, and even Weasley turned his eyes away from the door to stare at Draco.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked, puzzled.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s odd,\u201d Draco frowned, stopping his pacing to look at her. \u201cThat a troll turns up on Halloween, and Quirrell finds it, and then he turns out to have used a troll to protect the stone? Why would he have done that, if he could not deal with them?\u201d\n\u201cHe might have used the troll because it scares him,\u201d Ron argued.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still not exactly the best protection, if a bunch of First Years can knock one out two times in a row,\u201d Draco pointed out. \u201cBut even disregarding the stupidity of it, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s all too big of a coincidence?\u201d\nHermione looked at him, contemplating.\n\u201cI see what you mean,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut Snape was the one who got hurt trying to get past Fluffy. He was the one who tried to get rid of Harry after he\u2019d seen the wound. I saw him do it. And he was the one threatening Quirrell.\u201d\n\u201cBut why would he threaten Quirrel like this over a stupid troll?\u201d Draco demanded. \u201cIt makes no sense! Snape could deal with a troll if we can!\u201d\n\u201cHe could,\u201d Hermione nodded, biting her lip. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re missing something,\u201d Draco continued. \u201cThere must be something we\u2019ve overlooked, or misunderstood, because-\u201d\nBut in that moment, the door Harry had disappeared through opened again, and the other boy returned, looking triumphant. He had a big blood-red stone clutched in his left hand.\n\u201cYou got it!\u201d Weasley exclaimed, letting out a whoop of joy.\n\u201cThe Mirror of Erised is behind that door,\u201d Harry explained, grinning. \u201cI looked at it, and my reflection put the stone into my pocket. Suddenly, it was there.\u201d\n\u201cJust like that?\u201d Hermione asked, perplexed. \u201cShouldn\u2019t that have been harder? Why would Dumbledore just hand the stone to anyone who looked into that mirror?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Hermione,\u201d Harry shrugged. \u201cBut we have it, and now we should get out of here before Snape arrives.\"\n\u201cWe should,\u201d Draco agreed, picking up the bottle Hermione had pointed out to get them through the purple flames, looking at it closely. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to be careful just to drink a small sip each so no one gets stuck here.\u201d\nHe handed the bottle to Hermione first, then Harry, before he took a sip himself - he did not trust Weasley to measure his gulp correctly, the way he always wolfed down his food - and when they had all drunk, they made their way through the flames and out of the door.\nAs they made their way through the passageways, Draco tried to guess how much time had passed. How long had they been down here? It was sure to be evening, but how late exactly would it be? Would they be able to escape unseen before Snape, or whoever it was that was after the stone, made their way down to get it?\nJust as he was pondering this, they could hear the sound of dampened footsteps from the distance. Draco froze. So did the others.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Draco whispered, looking at Harry, who hastily shoved the stone into the pocket of his trousers. Draco desperately tried to think of a place to hide. If only they had already passed the chessboard, they could have kept to the shadows there - but they had only just left the room with the unconscious troll, and there were no shadows or hidden corners there.\nThe footsteps grew louder. Harry stood a little straighter and grasped his wand, as if getting ready for a fight. Draco wanted to laugh. Harry didn\u2019t really think they stood a chance against Snape or anyone else in league with Voldemort? They hadn\u2019t even learned to defend themselves against unfriendly attacks yet! The best they could do was throw a nasty hex at them and run!\nAt this thought, Draco also grasped his wand, going through every helpful spell he had ever learned, or just heard of. They were now able to make out the shape of a man in the distance. Draco\u2019s heart sank. Even from far away, that purple turban was clearly recognizable.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Quirrell,\u201d Harry muttered, sounding relieved, but Draco grabbed his arm and shook his head at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d hissed Harry, frowning.\n\u201cDon\u2019t trust him,\u201d Draco breathed. He caught Hermione\u2019s eyes over Harry\u2019s shoulder, and she nodded once.\n\u201cP-P-Potter,\u201d Quirrel stuttered as he approached them, shuddering as he took a look around the dark corridor. \u201cW-W-What are you d-doing down here?\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know we were here?\u201d Draco demanded, rather bravely, he thought. It was as if the need to protect Harry was giving him the courage he had been missing before.\n\u201cP-P-Professor M-McGonagall found you m-m-missing,\u201d Quirrel explained haltingly. \u201cS-She sent me-\u201d\n\u201cShe would have come herself,\u201d Draco narrowed his eyes, staring at Quirrell hard. He ordered himself to show no fear. \u201cYou\u2019re here because of the stone, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nQuirrell stopped quivering at his words, and a slow smile spread across his face.\n\u201cVery good, Mr Malfoy,\u201d he praised, amused. \u201cYou are your father\u2019s son, after all. I did not think you had it in you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m nothing like him!\u201d Draco sneered. \u201cWe won\u2019t let you get to the stone! We alerted Dumbledore, and he\u2019s on his way!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s lying,\u201d a high voice hissed, in rather breathy tones. Draco\u2019s eyes widened and looked around frantically. The others did, too. The voice had not come from Quirrell.\n\u201cYou\u2019re clever, Malfoy,\u201d Quirrell smiled. \u201cBut not clever enough. You, like your Head of House, might have seen through me, but none of you has it in you to stop me. Now, tell me - where is the stone?\u201d\nIt was Hermione who answered, but her voice was trembling and weak.\n\u201cWe - we haven\u2019t yet - we were just -\u201d\n\u201cPotter,\u201d the second, disembodied voice breathed, making Draco shudder. \u201cThe Potter boy has it.\u201d\nQuirrell\u2019s eyes zoomed in on Harry, who was still looking at Quirrell in shock.\n\u201cMr Potter,\u201d Quirrell smiled, stretching out his hand, palm up, waiting. \u201cIf you\u2019d please?\u201d\n\u201cNever,\u201d Harry spat, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to kill me.\u201d\nDraco refrained from groaning in despair and willed Harry to not give the other man ideas.\n\u201cLet me speak to him\u2026\u201d the disembodied voice instructed, and Draco took a shaky breath, looking around once more for the source of the voice. There was none. \u201cFace to face\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMaster, you\u2019re not strong enough,\u201d Quirrell muttered, his eyes unseeing, as if he was talking to himself.\nIt dawned on Draco then. He eyed the turban, and panic came rushing to his ears. They had to get out of here. Now.\n\u201cI have strength enough for this\u2026\u201d the voice said, and Quirrell, obeying, reached up to untie his turban.\nIt seemed like both Weasley and Draco had the same idea at the same time.\n\u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d\n\u201cLocomotor Wibbly!\u201d\nDraco pulled at Harry\u2019s arm the moment he had fired the spell, trying to get the frozen boy to move. Next to Harry, he saw Weasley reach for Hermione, but they did not come far. Quirrell deflected their spells wandlessly, and with another wave of his hand, he procured flames behind him, blocking their way.\nDraco yelped, and Hermione shrieked. Weasley cursed under his breath. Quirrell, though, was still smiling as he let the turban fall to the floor and turned around.\nBoth Draco and Hermione screamed. Harry\u2019s hand flew to his forehead, and he let out a pained gasp. A face was staring at them from the back of Quirrell\u2019s head, and it had glinting red eyes and slits where a nose should have been.\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d it said. Harry, his hand still pressed to his forehead, seemed still frozen. Unable to move, he stared up at the face in horror. \u201cSee what I have become? Mere shadow and vapour\u2026\u201d\nIt kept talking, but Draco could not hear what it said. There was a rushing panic dulling his ears once more, and it seemed to overwhelm him. The Dark Lord. This was the Dark Lord, and he was going to kill them. He was going to be forced to watch his friends die, watch Harry die, and then die himself. And there was nothing he could do. Nothing at all.\nThe rushing sound only dampened slightly when Harry stumbled backwards, breaking Draco\u2019s grasp on his arm. It was like a bucket of cold water in Draco\u2019s face.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d said the thing that was the Dark Lord. \u201cBetter save your own life and join me... or you\u2019ll meet the same end as your parents\u2026 They died begging me for mercy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLIAR!\u201d Harry shouted.\n\u201cHow touching\u2026\u201d the Dark Lord hissed. \u201cI always value bravery\u2026 Yes, boy, your parents were brave\u2026\u201d\nDraco desperately tried to catch the eyes of Hermione, of Weasley, but both seemed stunned, just staring up at the Dark Lord's face in horror. They had to do something! Draco wanted to scream at them.\n\u201cNEVER!\u201d Harry yelled at something the Dark Lord had said, and Draco, out of options, sent the Full Body-Bind at Quirrell\u2019s back. He grabbed Harry once more and ran, towards the fire. Maybe he could cast an Aguamenti at it, he thought furiously, but as they tried to run past Quirrell, the man, having repelled the hex once more, seized Harry\u2019s arm. Harry screamed in pain and struggled, and Draco pulled at him, but quite suddenly, Quirrell let go of Harry, yelling in pain himself. Draco looked around wildly, seeing that Quirrell was cradling his fingers, gasping.\nBoth Hermione and Weasley sent their own hexes at Quirrell, but with a wave of his hand, they were suddenly thrown backwards. They hit the stone wall hard and crumbled to the floor, unmoving.\n\u201cNO!\u201d Harry yelled.\n\u201cSeize him! SEIZE HIM!\u201d the Dark Lord called.\nQuirrell jumped at Harry, knocking him off his feet. Draco, in an instinct, grasped Quirrell by the shoulders and pulled, trying to get him off his friend. He could not follow what was happening. Quirrell was yelling, and so was the Dark Lord, and then, there was a shout of pain. Harry had grabbed Quirrell\u2019s face and was pressing his fingers to it with an expression of fevered determination. There was more screaming, and then Quirrell rolled off him, weeping in pain. Harry, his own face screwed up in pain, too, rolled after him, continuing to reach for Quirrell\u2019s face, which Draco now saw was blistering as if burned. All the while, the Dark Lord was shouting at Quirrell to just kill Harry, and suddenly, everything was still. Both Harry and Quirrell had collapsed on the floor, and Draco fell to his knees to pull Harry away. He shook his shoulders, panicked.\n\u201cHarry!\u201d he called. \u201cWake up! You can\u2019t be dead! Wake up!\u201d\nOver his fear, Draco did not notice the vapour rising from Quirrell\u2019s still body. It formed an indistinct shape, and then, just as Draco looked up, it lurched at him. Draco screamed, and everything went black.\n\n\nWhen Draco woke, he was in the hospital wing. He felt sluggish, and it took a moment for him to regain memory of what had happened. When he did, he sat up so quickly that the world was spinning around him.\nIt was dark, and the only source of light was the half-closed door to Madam Pomfrey\u2019s office. Draco could hear voices from it, but he couldn\u2019t focus enough to identify them. Instead, he looked around, searching\u2026\nHermione was in the bed next to him, her eyes closed, her breathing even. Two other beds were occupied on the other side of the infirmary, but it was too dark for Draco to make out the faces of the people lying in them.\nDraco threw his blanket back and got to his feet shakily. He felt dizzy, but he needed to make sure Harry was here. That he was alive. He stumbled across the room and almost fell, but he caught himself at the foot of what turned out to be Weasley\u2019s bed. He, too, was fast asleep, unaware of Draco\u2019s presence.\nThe other bed held a mob of unruly dark hair, almost hiding the scar on its occupant\u2019s forehead. The dingy glasses lay on the bedside table. Draco breathed in deeply, and his legs gave out underneath him. He sank to the floor, and the noise seemed to alert the people in the office, for the voices ceased very suddenly. The door opened fully, and Madam Pomfrey peeked into the room.\n\u201cMr Malfoy,\u201d she hissed, approaching him in fast steps. \u201cWhat are you doing out of bed?\u201d\n\u201cHarry,\u201d Draco muttered weakly.\n\u201cMr Potter will be fine,\u201d she informed him in a low voice, heaving him to his feet and half-carrying him back to his bed. \u201cAnd so will be Mr Weasley and Ms Granger. There is nothing to worry about. You need to rest.\u201d\n\u201cBut-\u201d Draco got out, with some difficulty. \u201cQuirrell - the stone - \u201c\n\u201cThere is no need to worry, Draco,\u201d said another soft voice, making Draco look over the school nurse\u2019s shoulder. There, in the darkness, stood Professor Dumbledore, looking down at him with a kind expression. \u201cProfessor Quirrell won\u2019t be able to harm anyone in the future. And the stone is safe.\u201d\n\u201cBut-\u201d Draco muttered, feeling his strength leave him as he spoke. \u201cThe Dark Lord-\u201d\n\u201cHas gone back into hiding,\u201d Dumbledore smiled. \u201cYou and your friends are safe. Please make sure to rest. You need it. I will explain everything in due time.\u201d\nDraco wanted to say something more, but his eyes fell closed, and he was gone.\n\n\nDraco, Hermione and Weasley were released from the hospital wing the very next day, but it took Harry three days to wake up. They spent as much time at his bedside as Madam Pomfrey would allow. When he did end up waking, though, they had been down at Hagrid\u2019s. Dumbledore had been there, though, and he had filled Harry in about everything that had happened, which was, in the end, how they acquired the missing pieces of information: That Quirrell had died by Harry\u2019s hands, a side effect of the protection his mother had left on him when she had sacrificed her own life for his. That the stone had been destroyed. That Snape\u2019s dislike for Harry stirred from an old schoolboy rivalry with Harry\u2019s father, but that, despite their suspicions, he had tried to protect Harry all year. Draco could have cared less about the explanation, though - he was just relieved that his best friend was well and out of danger.\nHarry was released in time for the end-of-year feast, in which Gryffindor, quite unsurprisingly, ended up winning the house cup. What was a surprise, though, was that all four of them received fifty points each for their houses - Weasley for \u201cthe best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years\u201d, Hermione for \u201cthe use of cool knowledge in the face of fire\u201d, Harry for \u201cpure nerve and outstanding courage\u201d, and Draco for \u201cunwavering loyalty in the face of great danger\u201d.\nDraco, in a moment of silence, had been agonizing about his own uselessness during those many, many tasks. Hermione had brought them past the Devil\u2019s Snare and Snape\u2019s riddle, Weasley had won the chess match for them and knocked out the troll, Harry had caught the key and gotten the stone - what had Draco done, apart from cowering in fear and putting together that Quirrell was the one after the stone about a moment before they happened upon him?\nLoyalty, he thought, resisting the urge to snort to himself as Dumbledore announced his doubtful forte to the rest of the school. When had he become such a Hufflepuff?! \u2018They call Hufflepuff students loyal in lack of any other useful treats,\u2019 his father had always scoffed, and Draco had believed it. What could you buy yourself from loyalty?\nBut as Harry had met his eyes, smiling brightly and cheering louder than any Slytherin did, he thought that maybe, if loyalty was what had brought Harry out of there alive, he could live with being known for it.\nIt turned out not to be his only quality. When exam results were announced, Draco ended up second best of the year, right after Hermione. Harry passed with good marks, too, and even Weasley came out above average.\nOn the way back to London, Harry was about as subdued as Draco. Both dreaded the prospect of going home, though, Draco conceded, he at least had his mother on his side. Harry had no one. Draco had not heard much about Harry\u2019s Muggle relatives, but he knew enough to realise that Harry was not wanted there, and it made Draco feel slightly nauseous that his best friend would have to spend two months in their midst. He wished he could have offered him to stay at the Manor, the way Weasley had promised to invite him to the Burrow, but even if his father had allowed it, Draco knew that Harry would rather stay with the Muggles than come to his home. Draco couldn\u2019t blame him. His only consolation was the owls they were sure to exchange, both stuck in places they did not want to be, isolated from all of their friends.\nOnly Draco\u2019s mother was waiting for him at the platform, which was a relief. He took his time saying his goodbyes to Harry and Hermione (and exchanged a cordial nod with Weasley) before strolling over to her. She smiled and bent down to kiss his cheek.\n\u201cWelcome back, darling,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you have a nice term?\u201d\n\u201cMostly,\u201d Draco shrugged, and his mother raised an amused eyebrow. \u201cI guess you heard about\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour little adventure?\u201d she quipped, humming. \u201cLet\u2019s just say your father broke a vase when he received the letter.\u201d\n\u201cA nice one?\u201d Draco enquired, because he had nothing else to say.\n\u201cNo, a horrid family heirloom from grandfather Abraxas,\u201d she shuddered. \u201cI was looking for an excuse to get rid of it for years.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Draco smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome?\u201d\nShe rolled her eyes, but she was smiling as she put a hand on his shoulder and led him towards the exit. Draco threw a look at Harry, who was chatting with Mrs Weasley. His friend looked up, as if feeling Draco\u2019s eyes on him, and smiled, waving. Draco waved back, and Aquila made a hooting sound from his cage.\n\n"
