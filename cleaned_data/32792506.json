    "notes": "<p>THIS FIC HAS A SEQUEL NOW. it\u2019s called <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/33726178\" rel=\"nofollow\">Left of the World</a> and it\u2019s part 6 of this series so go check it out if u want!!</p>\n<p>before u read this fic, y'all should know it's based off of another fic called Dark Matter by mysterycyclone, aka the fic that got me into Batman in the first place. and i'm so glad it did bc i actually joined the fandom right when the batman harley quinn show gate was happening on twitter and that was the most serotonin i've literally ever received in my LIFE. I did get the ok from the author to publish these fics tho don't worry!!</p>\n<p>if u don't read that fic (although u rlly should, it's a VERY good fic,) then all u need to know to understand it is that after peter got snapped in infinity war, he woke up in the DCU, and he's been barely scraping along alone in Crime Alley, and he decided to be Spider-Man in specifically the alley. i take a few creative liberties and also there are some differences because Dark Matter is still updating and i write off my theories/headcanons, but it's still heavily influenced by the fic so show the author some love!</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a> and <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>~ spiders in my head! spiders in my mind! ~</p>\n<p>i have been on a writing KICK lately so we'll see how this fucking works out!!!!! literally i've written like 200 pages in the past some week it's insane. also ik some of batman was ooc probably but also i could not care less i'm so sorry i just don't this fic was dredged up from somewhere VERY deep inside of me.</p>\n<p>anyway i'm a slut for kudos and comments, please leave them!!! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 i have a lot more peter parker and batman crack where this came from, and i might post those too! and knowing y'alls thoughts would help me. make that decision. some of those are. significantly longer than this. i just thought this might be easiest to start posting bc it's a lot lighter lmao</p>\n<p>all of peter's spider behaviours are either real science facts or lifted straight from canon. the bonus scene was a play on Spiders-MAn, that What If story about Peter Parker being devoured by an army of spiders who absorb his conscioussness (wtf). ethyl chloride is spidey's kryptonite in the comics, and he has canonically pretended to raise an army of spiders or eat criminals during interrogations before. i researched sm about spiders for this fic. i'm arachnophobic. i'm having nightmares.</p>\n<p>reminder that if u liked this then there\u2019s also the sequel :))</p>\n<p>ETA 12/04/2023 lmao i edit all my fics after they're posted. sometimes just little grammar things, sometimes adding whole new scenes &lt;3 this one i added a few more lines just to show peter's progression into being a little bitch.</p>",
    "text": "\u201cWhy Spider-Man?\u201d\nPeter\u2019s been getting asked that question since pretty much the first time he\u2019s ever put on the mask.\n\u201cI thought you were supposed to be the World\u2019s Greatest Detective,\u201d he jabs. \u201cFigure it out.\u201d\nBatman frowns, an unhappy set to his mouth. \u201cThe only spider-like abilities you have is to stick to things and shoot webs\u2014and the webs are artificial. You might as well have been Sticky-Man.\u201d\nPeter groans. \u201cActually, all of my powers are spider-themed,\u201d he informs. \u201cProportional strength, speed, senses, and durability of a spider. And my patented Spidey Sense\u2014actually, no one really knows what that is,\u201d he admits.\n\u201cAnd did you just happen to get exactly the same numbers as a spider?\u201d\n\u201cDude, my name is Spider-Man. Literally think about what that implies.\u201d Peter thinks it might not be a great idea to reveal how he got his powers just yet, but he can hint at it. \u201cI mean that, genetically, I am part spider, part man. That\u2019s why I chose the spider-shtick.\u201d\nBatman is probably in the running for the least expressive person Peter has ever met, but even he can\u2019t disguise the small grimace of disgust at that. \u201cWas one of your parents a spider?\u201d\n\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Peter agrees. It\u2019s not actually anything like that but hey, at least it throws the bats off for a bit. \u201cI mean, why did you think I was so arachnid-like? I thought you would\u2019ve figured it out.\u201d\nBatman looks frankly disturbed at the thought of Peter being born of a human and a spider. Honestly, in his situation, Peter would feel the same. But right now it\u2019s just funny. \u201cI assumed you were taking your role seriously.\u201d\n\u201cMethod acting,\u201d Peter grins. \u201cBut no. Actually, I try to hide my most spidery behaviours,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt tends to freak people out, and it\u2019s not a great look for my average Joe civilian ID.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a grudging intrigue in Batman\u2019s voice as he points out, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to hide in costume. People already know you\u2019re Spider-Man, why not lean into it?\u201d\nPeter tilts his head at him. \u201cI have a few times,\u201d he reveals. \u201cA lot of the behaviours come instinctively for me. Like this pose,\u201d he settles back into his crouch more, accentuating the unnatural, unhuman-like sense of it. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably see what I mean when I say creepy tics sooner or later.\u201d\nHe skitters across the floor on all fours, only the pads of his fingers or his toes ever touching the ground, with an inhuman speed to it. Like a spider plucking the strings of its web. He feels more than sees Batman\u2019s shoulders tense.\nHe snorts to himself. If the bat can\u2019t handle his crawling, then wait until he finds out about some of his more\u2026 unsavoury habits.\n-\nPeter decides he should ease them all into his spider-like tendencies.\nEven if he\u2019s not technically half spider, and even though he\u2019s never actually tested out how much of his DNA was changed by the bite, he knows a significant part of him is inhuman. The changes went farther than a six pack and better eyesight.\nBut his short conversation with Batman sticks with him because he\u2019s, well, right. There really isn\u2019t a reason to hide his traits anymore, not when it\u2019s already established that he\u2019s spider-themed. And it\u2019s not like he\u2019s ashamed of them, or freaked out like he was at first when some started to emerge.\nMostly, he just hangs upside down from the ceiling on a thin strand of web, or scurries like a spider from place to place. Doesn\u2019t stop his body from naturally contorting in ways that humans aren\u2019t meant to be.\nHe gets some odd looks, but they\u2019re not judging\u2014mostly curious, or even fascinated, and, okay, occasionally unsettled.\nOne night, Spider-Man catches a guy Batman had been tracking for three days.\n\u201cGood work, Spider-Man,\u201d he says, forcing out the words, awkward but genuine.\nPeter just gives him a salute, not bothering with a response. Honestly, he\u2019s pretty pleased with himself, too. That was quick thinking, and a smart trap, with both minimum risk and energy required. He\u2019s getting better at this whole hero gig.\nThere\u2019s a silence for a while, with Peter cheerfully watching Batman secure the criminal for good and having Oracle dispatch some cops. Then, the bat suddenly speaks.\n\u201cAre you\u2014are you making that sound?\u201d\nPeter startles, and the low humming momentarily stops. He flushes, extremely glad that his mask hides it. \u201cOh, uh, yeah.\u201d He ducks his head, bashfully rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019m kind of in a good mood tonight,\u201d he says as if that explains everything. Which it kind of does.\nBatman seems thrown out by it. \u201cWhat is it? The noise, I mean.\u201d\nThe sound comes back, albeit weaker and more self-consciously. \u201cUm, d\u2019you know that some species of spiders purr?\u201d\n-\nHe starts greeting the bats with a little chirping sound.\nOr, equally frequently, when the bats decide to try to scare him by popping up out of nowhere (damn you, Spidey Sense), he responds with a hiss, or the occasional growl.\nSometimes he does this for no reason, just to throw them off.\nIt\u2019s very fun.\n-\n\u201cSpider-Man, what the fuck are you doing?\u201d\nIt\u2019s Spoiler who asks that, actually. Peter doesn\u2019t look up from his glaring match with his opponent.\n\u201cWe\u2019re fighting for territory,\u201d he snarls, stooping low in his crouch and making a threatening lurch forward with his body, growling all the while.\nThere\u2019s a moment of silence as the bats process that. Then, Nightwing speaks. \u201cIt\u2019s like, the size of a fingernail. You don\u2019t need to fight for territory.\u201d\nPeter just bares his teeth, even through the mask. \u201cIt was  threatening  me,\u201d he defends. \u201cI\u2019m settling this. Also, it\u2019s one of the four most venomous species in New Jersey\u2014I know my stuff,\u201d he adds at their blank looks.\nBatman is glowering\u2014but then again, when is he not? \u201cJust step on it,\u201d he grumbles, which will probably be the only time ever that he encourages Spider-Man to kill an enemy.\nPeter yelps, finally breaking off from the glare with the spider. \u201cAre you  insane? It\u2019s a yellow sac spider! On top of the cytotoxin, they  eat other spiders. I\u2019m not trying to\u00a0die.\"\n\u201cSpider-Man,\u201d Batman snaps. \u201cYou\u2019re not  actually  a spider. It can\u2019t eat you. Just be careful not to get bit, and kill it.\u201d\nPeter hisses\u2014but it doesn\u2019t even matter. The spider he\u2019d been locked in a war with just turns around and leaves. Peter cries in indignance. \u201cYou just made me lose! Oh my God, this is so humiliating, I can\u2019t believe I lost to a  sac.\u201d\nNightwing comes forward and steps on it. Peter stares in wide eyed shock at the splat on the floor.\n\"Thank you,\" Spoiler sighs in utter exhaustion.\nPeter has nightmares of Nightwing stepping on him for weeks. Not that he would ever tell them\u2014they have enough on him to begin with.\n-\nPeter is walking on walls because he\u2019s so bored.\nStake-outs are honestly the worst part of the job, and even Batman\u2019s amazingly stellar and not awkward at all company is not enough to keep him from going insane. At first, he just walks up walls and across the ceiling of the abandoned building they\u2019d chosen as a look-out, which for some reason, gets Batman even more worked up than his skittering.\n\u201cHow much longer?\u201d He complains like a child ready to throw a tantrum.\nBatman looks as if he has a bad taste in his mouth. \u201cA while.\u201d\nPeter sighs. \u201cGreat. I\u2019m going to go make myself comfy, then,\u201d like he hasn\u2019t tried to do that several times before and just couldn\u2019t sit still long enough. But this time, he removes one of his gloves.\nBatman spares him a brief questioning glance before turning back to his binoculars. Peter pays him no mind, only crawls up the walls to a dusty corner of the room and starts nesting.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Batman narrows his eyes into the lenses.\nPeter pays him no mind. \u201cI\u2019m getting comfy,\u201d he repeats, shooting a strand of silk from one of his natural spinnerets on his wrists. There\u2019s a spider web already in the dark corner\u2014an ideal spot, really\u2014but the spider abandons it and drops to the floor the moment Peter approaches. \u201cYes, thank you. See,  this  is a reasonable spider. It sees that I am clearly much bigger than it and submits to me. Steatoda nobilis,\u201d he says fondly. \u201cA fine species. That\u2019s one I\u2019m from, exactly.\u201d\nBatman actually abandons his binoculars for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re part of their species?\u201d He asks incredulously. Then, more disturbed: \u201cYour webbing actually comes out of you?\u201d\nPeter snorts. \u201cI\u2019m from a lot of species, actually. It\u2019s why I have such a mix-and-match of behaviours. The spider that made me was a genetic mutant, experimented on until she died.\u201d And he knows what he\u2019s implying when he phrases it like this, but honestly it\u2019s not like he\u2019s  lying. Just a bit of misdirection. \u201cAnd I have both manufactured and biological. I made my web shooters first, but then,  surprise,\u00a0I also make this stuff.\u201d\n\u201cWhy still use the shooters, then?\u201d\nPeter doesn\u2019t stop from where he\u2019s building his web, quickly and efficiently. \u201cLonger range,\u201d he calls out. \u201cAnd they have more tensile strength, and take less energy for me. Natural spider webs were never meant for slinging. I use my web shooters to swing and get the guys, and I use my natural spinnerets when I want to make a web, stick anything  especially  hard or last longer than three hours.\u201d\nSatisfied with the state of his web, he crawls around on it, plucking strings like a spider. It\u2019s a  very  large web\u2014covers up most of the wall, and it\u2019s meters long. Enough for Peter to feel right at home. He sighs in contentment and dozes off.\nHe awakes to Batman uncertainly throwing chunks of debris onto his web.\nPeter doesn\u2019t realize this at first, waking up and scrambling to where the vibrations on his web came from, excited for his catch\u2014\nHe slumps in disappointment when it\u2019s not prey. And then has a crisis because what the fuck he was expecting, a human sized fly to slurp? Like, honestly.\nBatman, at least, looks properly distraught by this show. \u201cWe have to go,\u201d he tells Peter. \u201cThe buyers have arrived.\u201d\nPeter gloomily stalks off his web.\nThe fight goes easily until it doesn\u2019t. A guy holds a machine gun between both Batman and Peter, and although that would really be an easy enough fix, there\u2019s also some explosives in the room, and they can\u2019t afford any wild, stray bullets in such close vicinity.\n\u201cStay back!\u201d He yells, flipping the gun between the two vigilantes. \u201cI\u2019ll shoot you all to hell.\u201d\nPeter hunches over, grunting and moaning, back contorting in ways no human should be able to do.\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Bad Guy whispers.\nBatman actually looks distressed. \u201cSpider-Man, what are you doing?\u201d\nHe pants, heavy and loud. \u201cI\u2019m summoning them,\u201d he groans.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThe spiders!\u201d He makes jerky movements, slowly raising his arms up like Spider Jesus or something. \u201cI\u2019m summoning the spiders! I\u2019m calling for their aid, because I am the Spider-God, and my brethren will come in armies.\u201d\nThe gun drops onto the floor with a clatter, and Bad Guy raises his hands high in a surrender. \u201cI give, dude!\u201d He yells, panicked. \u201cStop!\u201d\nPeter slowly ceases his twitching movements, relaxing his body. \u201cThank you, brothers, for your eagerness to help, but it is no longer needed,\u201d he tilts his head back and says to the sky. Batman quickly apprehends the guy, and the cops arrive to arrest all of them.\n\u201cCan you actually do that?\u201d Batman asks, perturbed, afterwards.\nPeter is purring again, delighted at how the night had turned out. \u201cI was joking,\u201d he says, and chirps twice in wicked delight. \u201cI\u2019ve pulled that trick a few times. You won\u2019t believe how well it works.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a slackness to Batman\u2019s jaw that Peter finds extremely funny. \u201cJust how much spider are you? And how much human?\u201d\nPeter actually takes time to consider this. \u201cI\u2019ve never really checked,\u201d he admits. \u201cAnd only three people have ever seen me act full spider before. I think my spider genes are really fused in with my human ones, though. I mean, my eight eyes and all.\u201d\nHe adds that in as a joke, but is surprised to see Batman\u2019s eyes widen. You know what? He\u2019ll roll with it. Maybe it\u2019ll even help keep them off his back about secret identities.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t you acting very spidery,\u201d Batman says flatly. \u201cYou can be more.\u201d\nPeter chirps in cheery agreement. \u201cIf you ever see me pull a stunt like that, though, don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s all for show.\u201d Batman relaxes almost imperceptibly, and Peter tilts his head in heady contemplation. \u201cThat\u2019s not how I\u2019d really summon them.\u201d\nHe swings ahead, waiting for Batman to follow, purring all the while.\n-\n\u201cSpider-Man, focus.\u201d\nPeter snaps his attention back to where the bats are discussing how best to proceed in their information extraction without resorting to full-out torture, and he hears what they\u2019re saying. Full body threatening, bad cop worse cop, Red Hood wanting to just shoot the guy, uh huh, great. His mind wanders off again.\n Buzzzzzzzzz.\n\"Spider-Man,\"\u00a0Batman sounds impatient, like Peter\u2019s being purposefully difficult.\nPeter meets his eyes. \u201cSorry,\u201d he mutters somewhat sheepishly. \u201cThere\u2019s a fly here.\u201d\n\u201cIgnore it,\u201d he snaps, and Peter rolls his eyes.\n\u201cYou try that when you\u2019ve got super senses,\u201d he hurls back. \u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s buzzing at the base of my skull.\u201d\n\u201cJust kill it,\u201d Nightwing pipes in, leaning back on the hind two legs of his chair. \u201cOr is that going to give you nightmares too?\u201d\nPeter scowls at him, but stands up anyway. He hears the buzzing, can see the fly with an impossibly detailed sight. He stalks his prey, slowly inching closer and closer to the wall, and then suddenly, in a move so fast he\u2019s almost a blur, he traps it in his hands.\nHe feels the fly buzzing around within his clasped hands, and he walks over to the window.\n\u201cSorry, little guy,\u201d he talks casually to the fly. \u201cYou do look delicious, but today\u2019s your lucky day. I\u2019m kind of on a vegetarian diet\u2014well, I eat meat, but I try not to eat insects anymore.\u201d That was a wild ride. \u201cHere you go,\u201d he says, nudging the window open and letting it fly off.\nHe subtly licks his lips watching the fly leave.\nThere\u2019s silence in the room as Peter returns back to his seat. \u201cAs you were saying?\u201d He gestures to Batman, who\u2019s staring at him.\n\u201cDid you just say that fly looked delicious?\"\u00a0Red Hood demands.\nPeter winces. Oh. So he\u2019d let that slip. \u201cI don\u2019t get why all of you always get so surprised when I do something spidery,\u201d he says instead. \u201cLike, I\u2019m a  spider.\u00a0When will you get that through your head?\u201d\n\u201cYou eat  bugs?\"\u00a0It\u2019s Spoiler, this time, looking properly disgusted.\n\u201cAte,\u201d Peter corrects. \u201cI\u2019m reformed now. I, uh, accidentally ate a friend, and there\u2019s really no going back from that.\u201d\n\u201cYou ate your  friend?\" Nightwing sounds extremely upset by this revelation. \u201cYour friend was a  bug?\"\nPeter holds back a pained flinch. \u201cMore like a friend of a friend?\u201d He offers weakly, grimacing, remembering Antero. \u201cThis guy I know, Ant-Man, he can talk to ants, right? His daughter and I were friends, so I was over at his house, and I just saw this ant, and oh man, it looked so good. Turned out his name was Antero, and Ant-Man spent the next week looking for him and crying. He said he would forgive me as long as I promised to seek recovery.\u201d\n\u201cAnt-Man,\u201d Batman says, stony and expressionless. \u201cYou know a guy named Ant-Man, who can talk to ants.\u201d\nPeter nods. Antero really had tasted delicious\u2014just the right amount of juicy.\n\u201cAnts and spiders,\u201d Red Hood mutters under his breath. \u201cSpiders and ants. What\u2019s next, wasps?\u201d\nPeter makes a face, thinking about Scott\u2019s girlfriend. \u201cWell, actually\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStop,\u201d Red Hood orders, putting fingers to his temples. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know.\u201d\nPeter shrugs, turns back to the one-way mirror that shows their latest bad guy, who may or may not know where more of Black Mask\u2019s shipments are. \u201cYou know, this conversation actually reminded me of an idea\u2026\u201d\n-\nBad Guy wakes up in Peter\u2019s web.\nIt\u2019s a very expansive one\u2014covers most of the room, and Peter had had to use both of his spinnerets to make it. He lurks over, plucking the strings, trying to seem as distinctly spidery as possible.\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d he says, cheerfully. \u201cOh, I love it when they\u2019re awake. They taste better\u2014I mean, I know that it technically doesn\u2019t change anything, but half the fun is in the  experience,\u00a0you know? What fun is a bug when they\u2019re all asleep and boring?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Bad Guy forces out, attempting to sound tough but ending up terrified.\nPeter tilts his head, and then for good measure, tilts it further, until it should be well past broken. \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d He asks, picking at a strand of webbing that goes directly to Bad Guy\u2019s right foot. \u201cYou\u2019re caught in my web. You\u2019re trapped. And  I  am going to have a  meal.\u201d\n\u201cSpider-Man doesn\u2019t kill people,\u201d he says, almost like he\u2019s trying to assure himself. \u201cNeither does Batman.\u201d\nPeter laughs, a chittery sound that\u2019s more arachnid than human. \u201cYou see Batman around here?\u201d He questions, amused. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think you\u2019ll talk. Believe me, we\u2019ve both seen scum like you before. You  never  talk, so there\u2019s no point trying. No, Batman thinks you\u2019re safe and well, tucked away in a jail cell and rotting for the rest of your life. You\u2019re alone with  me. And  I  am going to eat  you.\u201d\nBad Guy is trembling in fear now, two seconds away from peeing his pants. \u201cYou don\u2019t do that.\u201d\nPeter leans forward in his webs. \u201cI do. I\u2019ve just eaten everyone who\u2019s ever known about it.\u201d He grins in delight at how squirmy Bad Guy is getting\u2014he\u2019d say he\u2019s going to crack any moment now. \u201cI\u2019m a spider, a natural predator. I hunt and eat prey. Take pride in being one of the few people to know just how arachnid I am\u2014I\u2019m going to bite you, and my venom will melt your insides, and I will leave you a husk of a body\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo! Stop!\u201d Bad Guy is crying. Good, his criminal record said he\u2019d killed an innocent old lady before. \u201cTell Batman I\u2019ll talk. Please, I\u2019ll talk. Don\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t eat me.\u201d\nPeter settles back, tries to force disappointment into colouring his own voice instead of satisfaction. \u201cShame,\u201d he sighs, making his way back to the door. \u201cYou looked so tasty, too.\u201d\n-\n\u201cYou don\u2019t actually eat people, right?\u201d\nPeter quirks a smile. \u201cNo,\u201d he reassures all of the bats. \u201cI don\u2019t eat people. I do have venom though.\u201d He clicks his teeth a few times, watching as the bats all simultaneously turn a micro-shade paler.\n\u201cSo you  could  eat people,\u201d Nightwing deduces, extremely unsettled. \u201cYou just choose not to. Because of morals.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone could eat people,\u201d Peter points out. \u201cI would just do it in an especially weird way. I tend not to let my really wild instincts get a hold of me. I do like smoothies, though,\u201d he adds wistfully. \u201cI like to wrap them up in my webs and then slurp. It\u2019s just as good as the real thing.\u201d\nNightwing pauses. \u201cGood to know,\u201d he says, and then claps Peter on the shoulder. \u201cNice work getting him to talk, but I also think I speak for all of us when I say we\u2019re never doing that again.\u201d\nSpoiler makes a noise of confirmation. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d She asks, gesturing to his body. \u201cThe moving thing. You looked like slime.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, this?\u201d He asks, squatting down on the floor and moving unnaturally quickly, quietly, joints moving in ways that should not be able to be moved. \u201cI\u2019m flexible.\u201d\n\u201cNo,  I\u2019m  flexible,\u201d Nightwing huffs, a sort of sick look on his face. \"That\u2019s  not human.\u201d There\u2019s no meanness to his words\u2014only fascination, with a touch of both envy and nausea.\nPeter blinks at him from his position on the ground, although they can\u2019t see it through the blankness of the mask. \u201cSpiders don\u2019t have bones.\u201d\nNobody knows what to say to that.\nPeter skitters up the wall, sticking on and hanging off by his feet flat on the ground and just a few finger tips. \u201cAnyway, if you don\u2019t mind\u2014I actually used up a lot of my bio-webbing back there. Since the dude\u2019s in a proper jail cell now, I was thinking I could catch a few Z\u2019s in my crib?\u201d\nEspecially since they still had work to do, what with tracking down the info Bad Guy provided, but Peter really needed a nap. And with the web, he\u2019d be able to feel if someone came too close for his liking.\nBatman scowls at him, but he doesn\u2019t growl some kind of disapproval, so Peter takes that as a yes.\nHe flashes a thumbs up at the bat, crawling to the ceiling and making his way back to the interrogation room. \u201cI\u2019m also running down on my aminos and proteins,\u201d he calls out carelessly. \u201cSo don\u2019t mind me when I\u2019m eating my webs. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and all that.\u201d\n-\nPeter does have bones.\nThey\u2019re just\u2026 looser than they should be.\nHe doesn\u2019t tell them that because it\u2019s funny to see them lose their minds when he gets floppy.\n-\nThe bats start bringing him smoothies when they have a designated meet up. They watch in fascination as he takes off his gloves and spin the cup around and around with his webbing until only the straw pokes out.\n\u201cWhere does the venom come from?\u201d Batman asks one day, glancing at where Peter\u2019s mask is lifted just above his mouth on a rooftop. \u201cYou don\u2019t have fangs.\u201d\nHe happily slurps away at the smoothie Nightwing had gotten him before being called off for something or other. It\u2019s mango flavoured. \u201cDon\u2019t need \u2018em,\u201d he says cheerily. \u201cComes out from one of my salivary glands\u2014and only when I want it to, or if I\u2019m, like, starving. I actually did do a lab on them once,\u201d he mentions thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird cocktail of several types of venoms\u2014both cytotoxins and neurotoxins. I hail from a strange mix of spiders.\u201d\nBatman pauses. \u201cAre they lethal?\u201d\nPeter shrugs. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s ever tested it out or anything. \u201cYeah. From what I\u2019ve found through, like, humane experimentation\u2014the neurotoxin comes first. That\u2019s what floods my mouth, sometimes.\u201d It tastes a bit\u2014almost soapy? It\u2019s not unpleasant, if a little alkaline. \u201cThe cytotoxin only comes out when I bite.\u201d\nHe sucks on the straw, hollowing his cheeks, a deep purr emanating from his chest. If mango-flavoured bugs existed, then Scott\u2019s friend or not, there would\u2019ve been nothing holding him back from a life with an arachnid diet.\n\u201cWhen you said you had some more off putting spider behaviours, I wasn\u2019t quite expecting this,\u201d Batman admits. \u201cI assumed they\u2019d be more\u2026 personality traits, or your creeping movement, instead of biological and dietary differences.\u201d\nPeter grins at him, showing his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019ve actually taken it a lot better than I thought you would,\u201d he compliments. Even if he still gets noticeably unsettled watching Peter sometimes. \u201cI mean, even in spider terms, I\u2019m weird. I freaked myself out with some of my powers, even.\u201d\nBatman jerks his head slightly. \u201cWhen you said you were genetically modified\u2026\u201d\nPeter bites his lips as he smiles, cheeks dimpling in the night. \u201cI\u2019m a mix-and-match of like a dozen different spider species, and something completely different,\u201d he explains, in further detail than he had previously. \u201cMy spider mom\u2014you know, the spider that birthed me\u2014was part of a cross-species genetics experiment. Lots of splice-and-diced DNA, and lots of radiation. I mean, I\u2019ve been experimented on a few times, but I\u2019ve never actually seen what they came up with.\u201d\n\u201cIs that why you hid your traits for so long?\u201d There\u2019s a firm set to Batman\u2019s jaw, and he seems even more tense than usual.\nPeter chews on his bottom lip. \u201cWhere I come from, people like me are kinda frowned upon,\u201d he reveals. \u201cMetas can be locked up, experimented on, tortured\u2014all legally, by some very powerful people. I never had too much of a problem as Spider-Man\u2014I had a high up figure looking out for me,\u201d he says wistfully, thinking about Tony. \u201cAnd I was pretty low-leagues, most of the time. Just trying to do my part on the ground, you know? But if my civilian identity was found out as Spider-Man or even just a meta, I would\u2019ve been thrown to the pits.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a deep sense of fury radiating off of the bat that Peter takes care to ignore. \u201cAnd where is this?\u201d\nPeter huffs a laugh. \u201cNot telling you that,\u201d he snorts. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about the metas\u2014last I heard, there was a huge prison break. But that\u2019s why we never looked into my genes all that much. I mean, I wanted to\u2014I\u2019m kind of a nerd,\u201d he admits, embarrassed. \u201cBut it was one thing for my mentor to shield me from metahuman rights politics, but in case I  was  arrested, he needed to be able to have a strong defence. Couldn\u2019t do that if he knew the exact numbers of how  not  human I am.\u201d\nHe sips at his smoothie more, his appetite slightly curbed from the topic at hand. He misses Tony, misses the security he felt knowing that fucking Iron Man always had his back.\n\u201cYou\u2019re human,\u201d Batman says. His voice has less of that signature growl than Peter\u2019s ever heard it before. \u201cEight eyes and all.\u201d\nHe blinks, startled. Then, like a crack in a dam, relief. He beams up at Batman with all the brightness of the sun. \u201cI like to think so, too,\u201d he agrees warmly. \u201cMy mentor\u2014he\u2019s kind of to me like how you are with your crew,\u201d Peter says contemplatively. \u201cHe tried to get me to embrace both my spider and my human. Didn\u2019t even complain about all the webbing in his house.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d The question has a weight to it, as if in some way he already knows. And maybe he does. Spider-Man is notoriously a loner\u2014especially with his repeated declines to joining the bat party. Two guesses as to why.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Peter answers honestly. \u201cBut I hope he\u2019s okay. I hope he comes for me soon. I\u2026 miss him.\u201d\nHe finishes his smoothie, leaning over the edge of the roof and dropping the empty husk into where he knows is an open dumpster. He should go home now\u2014they\u2019d already cracked down on the drug trade before Nightwing had left, and Peter doesn\u2019t normally tend to stick around after these things.\n\u201cWell, B-man, it\u2019s been fun,\u201d Peter says, tugging down the edges of his mask. \u201cLet\u2019s do it again sometime.\u201d\nBatman gives a quick nod that\u2019s uncharacteristically not-grumbly. Peter gives him a salute and shoots a web off the roof.\n-\nGotham City  sucks.\nPeter hates Gotham. New York  certainly\u00a0was never so mean to him\u2014except for the times it was, but whatever. Anyway, he\u2019s dying on the floor.\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d A guy in a Superman mask says, unbelieving glee in his voice. \u201cThat actually worked.\u201d\nPeter groans from his position on the ground in between hacking his lungs out. His throat is on  fire,\u00a0and his senses are going crazy, and he can barely  see.\nHis hand fumbles blindly upwards to his earpiece under the mask, switching it on for the first time that night. \u201cHey, Oracle?\u201d He chokes, voice low and rough and breaking. \u201cI need some back-up.\u201d\n\u201cSpider-Man?\u201d She replies through the unit, sounding surprised and more than a note concerned. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s one to call for help often\u2014mostly he\u2019s the kid-in-way-too-over-his-head type. \u201cSending someone on your way. Are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d he tries to manage out, before a kick to the stomach knocks the wind out of him. Okay, not so fine. But he\u2019ll be fine. Back-up\u2019s coming. He curls protectively into himself, body spasming slightly.\nA guy wearing a Flash mask crows delightedly. \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought? Spider-Man taken down by bug spray.\u201d\n Yeah, yeah, fuck you,\u00a0Peter thinks with a vengeance. Fuck them and their stupid little drug trade that Peter would\u2019ve left alone if they weren\u2019t creeps to their female customers about it, and their one lucky break that the bug killer they happened to pick up for the warehouse  also  happens to be the one that is deathly poisonous to Peter.\nPeter\u2019s heightened senses are failing, and everything blurs. Through the thick haze of gas, he can\u2019t breathe without his lungs searing in pain. And of course the criminal crew aren\u2019t affected, of course it\u2019s only  Peter  who gets fucked by the spray.\nHe can\u2019t see the next kick coming, or the one after, or the one after that. Distantly, he\u2019s aware that he shouldn\u2019t black out\u2014not while he\u2019s still on the ground.\nBut it just comes so easily.\nThe only thing he\u2019s aware of is when the pain stops.\nHe moans, eyes slowly blinking. His brain is sluggish, his body is writhing on the ground from pain and the gas, like a spider that\u2019s been knocked on its back and is now having each leg pulled off.\nA figure kneels down next to him. \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he says, voice distinctly bat-like.\nPeter completely ignores this because if the bat\u2019s here, then the wannabe Justice League are taken care of, and Batman doesn\u2019t know what he needs. He drags in an inhale, chokes on air.\n\u201cGet,\" he drags a painful breath, \"me outta here.\u201d He gags, convulsing on the floor.\nThere\u2019s a brief hesitation, before arms slide under his body and smoothly pick him up. Peter clings on desperately, chest heaving. He can feel the earth sway beneath him as they make their quick escape.\nSoon, he\u2019s being lowered to the ground, propped up against a brick wall. His fingers immediately fly upwards, twitching and jerking as they are, to push his mask about his mouth and nose so he can  breathe. \nInstead, he hacks up blood onto the ground.\nHe can feel panic coming off of Batman, which doesn\u2019t happen very often, so it kind of freaks him out more. His chest collapses under the weight of his breaths.\nBut now that he\u2019s out of the thick of the gas, he can feel his airways clear up with delicious, soothing, clean air\u2014well, as clean as it gets in Gotham, which is not very clean at all. He just needs a moment or twenty to catch himself, and he sputters as much to Batman in between groans.\nEventually, his lungs feel less  on fire  and more singed.\u00a0He places a hand on his chest and feels it stutter and hitch.\n\u201cThat  sucked,\"\u00a0he wheezes, voice sounding raw. His throat feels like it\u2019s gone three rounds with sandpaper. \u201cD\u2019you beat \u2018em up?\u201d\nBatman ignores the question, instead moving right onto his own. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d He demands. Peter belatedly realizes that one of his hands is still on his shoulder, pressing him back against the wall. \u201cYou were seizing.\u201d\nPeter pauses. Was he? He can\u2019t remember much of that whole thing. He wipes the drool and blood from his mouth with the back of his hand. His bottom lip is split, and it stings at his touch. \u201cEthyl Chloride,\u201d he rasps. \u201cAchilles heel.\u201d\n\u201cBug killer,\u201d Batman says flatly. \u201cYou\u2019re susceptible to bug killer.\u201d\n\"Especially  ethyl chloride,\u201d Peter agrees, trying to catch his breath. \u201cPoisonous. Kills\u2026 spider in me. Be fine, in like\u2026 a week?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a hard set to Batman\u2019s mouth. \u201cI\u2019m taking you back to the cave,\u201d he says firmly, and Peter jerks.\n\u201cNo!\u201d He coughs again, and Batman pushes against him harder to force himself to lean back and open his airways instead of curling up in pain. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Had it before.\u201d He\u2019ll have it again, too, if those asshats tell anyone about it. He\u2019ll ask Batman to have them put in solitary or something.\n\u201cYou need a blood test,\u201d he insists. \u201cYou just inhaled poison.\u201d\n\u201cTakes more to be lethal,\u201d Peter counters, which in hindsight might not be a great point. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just gotta\u2026 just gotta catch my breath.\u201d\nBatman growls in disapproval. \u201cYou can keep the mask,\u201d he tries to reason. \u201cJust get checked up, rest for a few hours.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s already shaking his head. \u201cHome,\u201d he gasps. \u201cEarly night. Maybe few days off. Fine.\u201d He gives a weak grin, flashing his teeth\u2014which is maybe not as reassuring as he\u2019d hoped, what with the blood in his mouth and all.\nBatman opens his mouth to protest again, maybe even order him to stop being stupid, but Peter drags one arm up and rests a trembling hand on the crook of Batman\u2019s elbow, where he\u2019s holding Peter steady by the shoulder. \"Home,\"\u00a0he repeats.\nBatman stays with him until he can breathe without rasping.\n-\n\u201cDo you have any other spider-based weaknesses?\u201d Batman asks him next time Peter\u2019s out again.\nIt had taken him longer to recover from the ethyl chloride than he\u2019d hoped\u2014possibly because he was starving and not sleeping. Over a week had gone by since, and his voice was still a little throaty.\n\u201cUh, a few.\u201d Peter rubs the back of his neck shyly. \u201cEssential oils are pretty bad for me, and I don\u2019t like things that are too vinegary, or lemony, or baking soda-y. I had a friend, actually. Whenever she was mad at me, she\u2019d put on eucalyptus hand sanitizer, just to really dig it in.\u201d\nHe gets all mushy thinking about it, remembering having to stand ten meters away from a pissed off MJ, yelling out apologies for whatever dumb thing he did. He misses her.\nAt least Batman quirks a small smile at that\u2014an impossible feat in and of itself. \u201cSo if I ever want you to back off a case, I can spritz you with vinegar?\u201d\nPeter hisses at him. \u201cYou do that, and I will bite you.\u201d\n\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Peter says, rather cheerful for the discussion topic. \u201cThat\u2019s about it.\u201d\n-\n\u201cOkay, so there is one more thing,\u201d Peter says one dreary, freezing night. \u201cJust one tiny, minor detail I forgot to mention about spider weaknesses.\u201d\nBatman levels him with a terrifying glare. Peter pretends he doesn\u2019t notice, just shivers harder.\n\u201cYou forgot to mention that you  hibernate,\"\u00a0Batman growls, and Peter winces.\n\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d He defends himself. \u201cI just\u2014spiders can\u2019t thermoregulate. Causes me to shut down.\u201d\nIf anything, Batman\u2019s glower gets even  worse. It\u2019s colder even than the frosty weather. \u201cSo you forgot to mention that the cold will  kill you.\"\nPeter sees his own mistake. \u201cOnly the really bad cold,\u201d he yelps. \u201cOtherwise, I just take a little nap, that\u2019s all. I\u2019m coldblooded.\u201d\nIt was not a little nap. He\u2019d been in the middle of patrol when he\u2019d stopped just to take a breather, and then somehow had wound up deep asleep, tucked in behind a gargoyle, since Friday night. It was almost Sunday, now, and apparently the bats had kept an eye out. Okay, so maybe it is hibernation.\nThey\u2019re still by the gargoyle now, sheltered from the wind just a bit. Peter winces. He feels kinda bad\u2014must not be Batman\u2019s idea of a good time to go looking for him and then find him passed out with an incredibly slow heart rate, very resistant to being roused.\nAt least he\u2019d found a heart beat before he was going to take off his mask.\n\u201cYou need a warmer suit,\u201d Batman grumbles. \u201cA jacket. Or a way for someone to know when you\u2019re  \u2018shut down.\u2019\"\nPeter shrugs, not too bothered. \u201cIt actually doesn\u2019t happen all that often,\u201d he offers, trying to reassure him. \u201cAnd it\u2019s no big deal. Just a little doze. I kind of get into nooks and crannies a lot.\u201d\nBatman looks such a strange mix between baffled and irritated, it\u2019s kind of funny. Honestly, Peter remembers Tony\u2019s reaction when he\u2019d first found him passed out in a laundry basket. It was the best sleep he\u2019d had in weeks.\nNow that he\u2019s awake, his body is getting colder and colder. He curves in on himself to try to conserve body heat. Gotham is like New York, only worse. It\u2019s cold but dry, and the air prickles at Peter\u2019s skin even through the suit.\nAnd then suddenly it doesn\u2019t.\nPeter blinks owlishly as Batman undoes his cape and drapes it around his figure. After a stunned moment of hesitation, he wraps it around himself.\nBatman sighs, even as his rigid stance doesn\u2019t change. \u201cWe need a way to keep an eye on you,\u201d he resounds. \u201cIf you\u2019re in danger, somebody needs to know.\u201d\n\u201cI have the earpiece,\u201d Peter points out. \u201cI can just call out for help.\u201d\n\u201cLike you did Friday?\u201d Batman flatly counters, and okay, point, but Peter\u2019s not going to just let him have that.\nPeter bites the inside of his cheek in heady teenage rebellion. \u201cI didn\u2019t need help on Friday,\u201d he shoots back. \u201cI\u2019m  fine.\"\nBatman is less than impressed, if the twitching on the right side of his mouth says anything. \u201cYou could\u2019ve died,\u201d he says stonily. \u201cYou  could  die, next time.\u201d\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be a next time,\u201d he assures with a cheery confidence. \u201cI\u2019ll be more careful. And besides,  if  it happens again,\u201d which honestly it might, considering Parker Luck and also who Peter is as a person, \u201cthen you\u2019ll find me, won\u2019t you?\u201d\nPeter doesn\u2019t miss the way Batman thaws slightly at this, but he also doesn\u2019t know how to react. He just pulls deeper into the cape.\n\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d Batman says softly.\n\u201cSo there\u2019s nothing to worry about,\u201d Peter reasons smoothly.\nThere\u2019s a moment of quiet after that. Now that Peter\u2019s body is warming up from the low-homeostasis sleep state he was in, he\u2019s truly appreciating the delightful warmth of the cape, which actually offers much more protection from the weather than he\u2019d have thought.\nHe snuggles into it further, a low purr unconsciously escaping from him, barely audible above the noises of Gotham.\n\u201cGo home, Spider-Man,\u201d Batman tells him quietly. \u201cWarm up.\u201d\nFor once, Peter doesn\u2019t argue as he straightens up. \u201cI\u2019m trusting you,\u201d he warns, but there\u2019s no real threat or bite to his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t follow me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m up to swing.\u201d His sleep-addled mind\u2019s not clear enough to calculate his aim, and his Spidey Sense hasn\u2019t been the most reliable lately.\nBatman nods, and Peter believes him.\nHe reluctantly unbundles himself from the cloak, holds it out. Batman doesn\u2019t make a move to take it.\n\u201cI have others,\u201d he says, peering distrustfully at how Peter\u2019s standing just a little off kilter from his centre of balance.\nPeter tilts his head fleetingly, and then pulls the cape back on, sighing into the warmth. \u201cYou think I could be Batman?\u201d He cheeks, only slightly tired. He doesn\u2019t wait for a response, only flings himself off the gargoyle\u2014which is too high for a normal person to jump off of without something to catch themself on. He hears Batman\u2019s breath hitch watching him fall.\nHe lands in his crouch, cloaked in dark fabric, his unnaturally strong but flexible joints absorbing the force of the impact. He suddenly feels a lot more awake.\n\u201cHey, this is fun!\u201d Peter calls back up at Batman, whose slightly faster heart rate betrays his indifferent expression. \u201cMaybe I should add a cape to my suit.\u201d He swishes it around the way he\u2019s seen Dr. Strange\u2019s cloak friend do, and turns in the general direction of the firehouse\u2014meaning to take a few wrong turns, just to be safe.\nPeter is right in that it never happens again, if only because every time the temperatures dip below freezing, Batman will track him down and tell him to go straight home.\nHe\u2019ll take his wins where he gets them, he supposes.\n-\nThere\u2019s a bomb.\nIt\u2019s a trap, a minefield. Peter\u2019s Spidey Sense has been going off just looking at the floor, but he ignores it, because he\u2019s an idiot, because he doesn\u2019t know how to say to the Batman: Hey, a weird sense tells me we\u2019re in danger while infiltrating a gang warehouse. That\u2019s weird, right? Let\u2019s forget all this and leave. \nBatman steps on the trigger, and Peter  runs.\nHe runs towards the bomb.\nHe shoves Batman so hard he flies across the room.\nThe bomb explodes.\n-\nDistantly, Peter\u2019s aware of the pain.\nHis leg was burned, is burning, will continue to burn.\nHis chest is lacerated, so is his stomach, so is everything about him.\nBatman is there. A furious, flying frenzy. He yells something to Peter and then he yells something to no one. He calls for help.\n\u201cHold on, just hold on,\u201d he repeats like a prayer. The words stick like static to Peter's brain.\nEverything is far away, even the pain. He fades and then comes to, and then fades again and comes to again.\nHis mask is pulled off, and he stirs, blinking up at nothing.\nAt least he can see clearly, some part of Peter\u2019s brain says, trying to rationalize the situation. And at least his breath isn\u2019t muffled, and at least Batman is here, and he looks alright. Peter must\u2019ve pushed him back really far, and it looks like his cape got the worst of it anyway.\nPeter\u2019s body unconsciously reacts to the pain even as his mind can\u2019t process it.\nHe fades, then comes to.\n-\nHe wakes up several times during surgery. They don\u2019t have anything strong enough to keep him under, or to stop the pain. Eventually, he passes out cold, for good, one last time.\nHe wakes up two days later.\nPeter\u2019s eyes slowly peel open, stinging and dry. He blinks owlishly at the ceiling.\n\u201cOw.\u201d\nHe mutters it, but it doesn\u2019t matter anyway because someone hears him, and then suddenly a large man is by his side.\n\u201cWhat works on you?\u201d The man desperately demands, eyes wild. \u201cWhat painkillers?\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t really enter Peter\u2019s brain at first, as sluggish as it is. It takes half a minute to even come up with an answer, with how the pain suddenly and deeply sets into his bones. \u201cMidazolam,\u201d he gasps. \u201cWith morphine. Seven times dose.\u201d\nThe man doesn\u2019t question the impossibly high dosage, only scrambles to a stand in which some medical equipment lies, opening a drawer and taking out many needles and little bottles of painkillers. Peter closes his eyes, tries to separate himself from the pain as much as possible.\nIt\u2019s always a whole ordeal to get him doped up. Back home, they could use some of their super-soldier serums\u2014triple Captain America\u2019s dose, generally. But with normal painkillers, they\u2019d have to use bottles and bottles of the stuff before Peter even got affected, and not only that, but it was also unsafe to go any higher at some point. They always ran the risk of his heart just giving out, especially while under stress from injuries.\nPeter\u2019s face spasms as the first of the injections start, and he feels steady hands grab his arm as a needle goes in. The man must have some knowledge in doing this, because his hands are clinical and he spreads the shots apart enough.\nIt takes a while, all the shots that need to be given, and injections are pretty immediate-relief. By the time the last of the shots are being finished up, the first of them are kicking in.\nPeter\u2019s body relaxes, losing the tension he\u2019d been holding from the pain. Midazolam should in theory knock him out, but for him it would just make him drowsy. He can still feel the pain, sharp and clear as ever, but there\u2019s some kind of barrier between it and him.\n\u201cGood now,\u201d he says, as the distance between him and the pain grows even further. \u201cHurts less. Yay.\u201d His voice breaks from disuse.\nHe finally opens his eyes again, squinting at the man. He kind of looks familiar, although Peter could not say from where.\n\u201cWhen\u2019s your next dose?\u201d He asks, and his voice is tight with\u2026 something. Peter\u2019s head spins too much to think about it.\nHe takes a moment to make sure he\u2019s remembering it right, thinking back to the too-frequent medbay trips with Tony. \u201cTriple dose, every two hours,\u201d he rasps. \u201cFour if I\u2019m asleep.\u201d\nThe man has a hint of a frown as he takes this in, averting his gaze from Peter, unable to meet his eyes.\nPeter blinks at him confusedly. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\nThe man hesitates, an unnatural stillness to his stance. \u201cI\u2019m Bruce,\u201d he finally settles on. \u201cWe know each other, through our\u2026 night lives.\u201d\nPeter has no reaction at first, thinking what on earth he could possibly mean, and then all at once, his jaw gapes. His eyes widen comically, and he chokes on his own spit. \"You\u2019re  Batman?\u201d\nBatman\u2019s Super Secret Identity Bruce nods in a tentative confirmation.\nThere\u2019s a moment where Peter just stares at Bruce, who looks like he\u2019s seen better days, trying to see it. His brains make connections far too slowly, comparing every possible feature. And then he bursts into giggles.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Batman,\u201d he repeats between little gasping laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re vengeance, you\u2019re the night. That Batman.\u201d\nBruce should probably be offended by his reaction, but if anything, he looks sick. \u201cDo you remember what happened?\u201d He asks in a low voice, something shameful etched into his face.\nPeter\u2019s a bit taken aback by how serious his expression is, until he realizes he  does  remember what happened, and decides maybe he should sober up, too. \u201cThe bomb,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a trap. I felt it just before it went off.\u201d\n\u201cIt was touch and go there for a while,\u201d Bruce says quietly, and  oh, the weird expression on his face is  guilt. Because of course it is. \u201cAn associate doctor performed surgery on you, and then we brought you home to recover.\u201d\nPeter notes the room he\u2019s in then. It\u2019s absurdly expensive feeling, in that distinctly Old Money classy way and not Tony\u2019s futurist one. He tucks that away for later.\n\u201cIt ended up alright,\u201d Peter tries to reassure at that horribly grief-stricken look on Bruce\u2019s face. \u201cThanks for, like, not letting me die. But we\u2019re both not dead so everything\u2019s fine.\u201d\nIf anything, Bruce looks even worse, bitter remorse and sorrow written in every line. He opens his mouth, closes it, then opens it again. \u201cYou\u2019re not fine,\u201d he breathes, pain in his voice. \u201cYou were  blown up.\"\nPeter isn\u2019t too bothered about it. He\u2019s definitely had worse\u2014like when he\u2019d died, for example. And even the pain is nothing compared to the spider bite.\n\u201cYou nearly bled out on the table,\u201d Bruce presses on. \u201cYou sustained major lacerations and abrasions throughout your entire body, but\u2026 your left leg was directly on top of the explosion.\u201d\n\u201cThat explains why it hurts so much,\u201d Peter remarks dryly. Bruce looks like he\u2019s been punched in the face.\nHe takes a small stuttering breath, obviously steeling himself for something\u2014which is weird, because Peter wouldn\u2019t have thought Batman needed to steel himself for anything.\n\u201cPeter,\u201d he begins slowly, and he startles at the use of his real name, even though of course Batman would\u2019ve figured it out by now. \u201cYour leg was too close to the bomb, and it was\u2014it\u2019s gone. Your leg is gone. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\nPeter stares at him flatly for a second, because that can\u2019t be right. He still feels his leg\u2014it hurts like  hell. And then he jerks his hands to move to push away the blanket from off his body, because he needs to  see.\nStrong hands push back against them, trying to keep Peter lying down, not agitate his number of bandages, but even half-blown-up and doped up, he\u2019s stronger than the bat on a good day. Eventually, Bruce seems to realize this, and instead of holding him back, he gently helps him take the blanket off.\nThere\u2019s a massive bandage where half of his leg should be. It ends in a stump just less than mid thigh.\nPeter stares at it.\n\u201cWell, that sucks,\u201d he finally says, taking pity on Bruce, who looks like the silence is eating him alive.\nBruce is averting his eyes again, his face pale and drained of blood. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he repeats again, voice cracking.\nPeter jerks his head up at the raw display of emotion from Batman\u2014fucking Batman. He looks like he\u2019s about to fall apart.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d he immediately says, alarmed. Peter remembers similar conversations with Tony, how that man carried a guilt complex as big as Peter\u2019s own. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll be back on my feet\u2014well, foot,\u201d for now at least, \u201cin like a week.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s easy dismissal of his injury only seems to distress Bruce more. \u201cYou can stay as long as you want,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cActually, you won\u2019t be leaving unless I know you have someone to look after you.\u201d Peter winces\u2014that\u2019s not going to happen, and of course Batman notices and correctly interprets it.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he insists again. Tony tried to ban him from saying that once, and it didn\u2019t go so well. \u201cHonestly. Like yeah, it sucks, and it hurts like a bitch, and I\u2019ll have to take a few months off from being Spider-Man\u2026\u201d Peter trails off in contemplation.\nBruce looks confoundedly upset. \u201cPeter, you lost your leg,\u201d he says as gently as he can. \u201cYou won\u2019t go back out there.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter is immediately indignant. \u201cI can\u2019t just  stop  being Spider-Man.\u201d\n\u201cYou need to.\u201d Bruce\u2019s voice is sorrowful, but resolute. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Crime Alley, I\u2019ll take care of it. It\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d\nPeter blinks at him again. In his drug-addled state, he doesn\u2019t quite know what else to do. \u201cYeah, for like, a month or two. But then I\u2019ll be back in the game. I can\u2019t let  one  bad experience put me off for good.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a  bad experience,\"\u00a0Batman stresses, his voice tight. There\u2019s a strain to how he holds his body that\u2019s making Peter uncomfortable. \u201cOf course we\u2019ll get you the best care we can find, and if you want a prosthetic, you\u2019ll have one. But I can\u2019t let you go out into the field with one leg.\u201d\nPeter cuts off from his prepared argument. \u201cOh,\u201d he blurts out. \u201cI think I know what the problem is.\u201d He looks down at his missing leg again. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s gonna grow back.\u201d\nBruce looks like he\u2019s been hit. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d\n\"My leg.\" He pokes at the bandage, wincing when a sharp pain courses through his body. That's on him; he doesn't know what he was expecting. \"You know how, like, if spiders lose their legs, they mold and grow it back? Yeah, my skin's gonna peel off at some point, and I'll be good as new.\"\nBruce\u00a0stares at him with something akin to horror. \"Your skin peels\u00a0off?\"\n\"No,\" Peter immediately assures. \"Sorry, I don't know why I said that. I just felt like lying. But my leg will grow back, that part's true. It's just gonna hurt and itch like hell for a while. I actually don't know how long it takes\u2014it took me a month for my teeth to come back in the last time, so probably at least that long.\"\n\u201cYour legs grow back.\u201d\nPeter nods.\n\u201cAnd your teeth.\u201d\n\u201cMy eyes, too,\u201d he chimes in.\nBruce\u2019s expression is a mix of one of a man who\u2019s just been exonerated in the line for a guillotine, as well as of a man who\u2019d just been told that Peter could grow back his leg like a spider.\n\u201cYou\u2026 could have led with that.\u201d\n-\nTrue to his word, Bruce doesn\u2019t let Peter leave his house\u2014which turns out to be a mansion. He also turns out to be Bruce fucking Wayne, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.\nPeter kind of gets it. If something like this happened at home, there\u2019s no way Tony would let him leave his sight for months. He\u2019d be so grounded. Also, something like this has kind of already happened at home, what with him dying and all, so when he gets back he has micromanaging and helicopter parenting to look forward to\u2014from both Tony and May.\nBruce still seems to permanently carry the guilt of Peter\u2019s injury around with him. He was the one who stepped on the bomb, after all, and Peter had gotten hurt pushing him out of the way, while Bruce had ended up with only a few burns, stitches, a fair amount of bruises.\nThe guilt complex is a part of the gig, probably. If they didn\u2019t feel guilty, that might make them the bad guys. Even so, Peter tries his best to reassure Bruce like he would\u2019ve Tony\u2014through gentle humour and good-natured acknowledgement of what happened.\nHe also meets the family out-of-suit. He\u2019d never actually interacted all that much with Robin, but he's warming up to Damian in a way that Damian definitely isn't warming up to him. Or maybe he is. At least he isn't yowling at him like a cat, the way he does to Tim.\nSurprisingly, he\u2019s met everyone else out of costume before.\nThere\u2019s a lot of yelling when he sees Tim and Duke.\nPeter isn\u2019t allowed to go to school yet\u2014Bruce pulled some strings to get him excused and able to learn from home. Probably a good thing, not to let them know that his left leg is currently missing but not for long. Tim and Duke are still going, of course, because it\u2019s also apparently not a great idea to have their absences coincide on each other.\n\u201cYou could use the wheelchair, you know,\u201d Bruce says, eyeing how Peter is precariously keeping balance of a hoard of notebooks in his arms while hopping on his one leg.\nPeter shrugs, and then nearly topples over trying to keep all of his books together. \u201cI like hopping.\u201d Except for when he falls. His balance might be impeccable on two legs, but this was rather beginning to become tiresome\u2014and he doesn't like the blow to his dignity whenever he crawls outside of his room. \u201cIt\u2019s too much work to get the chair.\u201d\nBruce sighs long-sufferingly, walking over to Peter and taking the books from his arms. Peter lets him, gratefully. \u201cAre you going back to your room?\u201d\nPeter\u2019s room is too big and too expensive and far too cushy, and he doesn\u2019t like to spend much time in it, except for the days he can\u2019t get out of bed. \u201cThe lab,\u201d he says instead, ignoring Bruce\u2019s frown at that. He doesn\u2019t like it when Peter turns into a little lab gremlin. \u201cI\u2019ve got a new project.\u201d\nBruce\u2019s frown sets in even deeper at that. A new project for Peter means no sleep, no eating, no leaving the lab\u2014and given the caliber of this next one, Peter is probably going to be very, very busy. He\u2019d learned from Tony, after all. Bruce sets down the notebooks on a table, overlooking Peter\u2019s objections.\n\u201cI need those, you know,\u201d he remarks pointedly, starting to skip closer to the table to get them himself.\nInstead of stopping him, Bruce takes him in his arms and picks him up smoothly.\n\u201cOr you can do that,\u201d Peter sulks. He\u2019s been getting hauled places against his will for the past three weeks, and he\u2019s more than a little grumbly about it. Sometimes he\u2019ll begrudgingly allow it, if only because there are lots of stairs in the manor, but really there\u2019s no better way to make him feel like more of a child. Especially when all Bruce has to do to get him out of the lab is just pick him up like a sack of potatoes.\nThe worst are when Duke or Tim are around. They\u2019re not mean about it, but those are his  friends,  and he looks like a  baby. Although he does enjoy making Dick give him a piggyback ride, if only because he gets such a look about it. He also enjoys requesting tricks while he\u2019s stuck on\u2014some of which are actually obliged.\nTo his surprise, Bruce doesn\u2019t carry him to his room\u2014instead, he turns into the makeshift medbay  beside  Peter\u2019s room. Great.\n\u201cI\u2019m changing your bandage,\u201d Bruce informs like it wasn\u2019t obvious the moment they stepped in the room. He gently sets Peter down on a couch. \u201cAnd then you get three hours.  Three,\u201d he warns, seeing Peter perk up. It doesn\u2019t get to him, he\u2019ll probably be able to push it, or sneak in while everyone\u2019s out being bats. \u201cAnd you have to take a break for dinner.\u201d\nPeter shrugs, obliging. He wiggles impatiently as the bandage comes off of the stub of his leg.\nIt\u2019s definitely growing. The stump is just an inch or two longer than it was since the explosion, which was almost a month ago, although it is healing faster with time. At this rate, he\u2019ll have to put off being Spider-Man for a long while\u2014which is why it\u2019s the perfect time to start on his project.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to need a full list of all of your spider powers,\u201d Bruce says, hands gently checking the new skin. It\u2019s red and tender, and more than a little sore. \u201cAnd a real explanation of how you got them.\u201d\nPeter snorts. \u201cRadioactive spider bite,\u201d he gives in. \u201cI wasn't actually born from a spider. And you know most of them.\u201d\n\u201cI want numbers,\u201d Bruce insists. He takes a soft towel and some distilled water, gently washes the limb.\n\u201cActually, I do have some measurement,\u201d Peter admits. \u201cMr. Stark couldn\u2019t have done a gene test on me, but we did a few physicals. We didn\u2019t check everything, but I can run 250 miles per hour\u2014except only for fifteen minutes before collapsing\u2014and jump 85 meters. I can also breathe underwater for a scary amount of time, and we didn\u2019t have anything heavy enough to test my strength but I  have  lifted up a building before.\u201d\nBruce pauses at the quantitative data he clearly wasn\u2019t expecting to be getting. \u201cThat is terrifying.\u201d\nPeter shrugs. \u201cProportional to a spider,\u201d he says cheerily.\nIt\u2019s a quick affair\u2014checking the stump, washing it, rebandaging it to protect the sensitive and still-healing skin. When it\u2019s done, Peter fiddles as he watches Bruce put away the supplies.\n\u201cLab time now?\u201d He asks hopefully, grinning when Bruce sighs in a way which he knows means he\u2019s conceding. He raises his arms like a toddler, willingly, this time, settling into Bruce\u2019s hold on him.\nPeter knowing about all of their outings as bats means he\u2019s allowed access to the cooler lab used to make all of the bat stuff. Bruce carries him down and sets him on a rolling chair so that he can get around by himself.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get your notebooks,\u201d he says before leaving the room.\nInside are several half-finished projects that Peter\u2019s been tinkering with in his spare time, as well as more than a few bat gadgets, some of which Peter\u2019s been taking apart. He rolls to the work bench, pushing up his sleeves.\nBruce returns quickly, dropping his notebooks off on the table. \u201cWhat\u2019s your new project?\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d Peter looks up from where he\u2019s been getting more work paper. \u201cOh, uh, it\u2019s a pretty big one. I\u2019m looking for a way home.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a pause. \u201cTo Queens?\u201d\nPeter nods. \u201cThere\u2019s just something I have to do before I can go home.\u201d He looks wistfully at his hands, wringing together in his lap. \u201cMr. Stark wouldn\u2019t give up looking for me if he thought there was a chance he could find me, but he also just might not think there  is  a chance. And I suddenly have all this free time, so I figured if he can\u2019t find me, then I\u2019m going to find him.\u201d\nHe says this with a steadfast determination. Honestly, the laws of Parker Luck dictates that nothing ever really works out for him, even when it does\u2014but the prerequisites of being a Parker in the first place also states that Parkers don\u2019t believe in no-win situations. This can be done, it has to be possible.\nBruce hesitates. \u201cAnd if you do figure it out?\u201d He speaks with an odd tone.\n\u201cThen I go home,\u201d Peter closes his eyes briefly, thinks about the paralyzing fear of May being snapped. \u201cI was worried there isn\u2019t much of a home to go back to but\u2026 if Mr. Stark\u2019s there, then I can always make one, right?\u201d He can find another family. And he can try harder than anything to get May back, to get  everyone  back.\n\u201cYou have a lot of faith in him,\u201d Bruce observes, a note of\u2026 something in his voice. He looks sullen, and then suddenly shifts to masked mortification\u2014for what, Peter doesn\u2019t know.\nPeter chews on the inside of his cheek. \u201cI trust him,\u201d he decides, words forceful. \u201cWe never really talked about it, but\u2026 he was kinda like a dad to me. I miss him a lot. And he\u2019s like the smartest and coolest person ever, so if anyone can figure it out, it\u2019s him.\u201d\nBruce\u2019s expression is like he\u2019s swallowing a lemon. Or a golf ball. Or something just overall too big and awkward and bitter. A grapefruit? \u201cWill you ever tell me what happened in Queens?\u201d He asks, a hint of bitterness coming through his normally carefully composed voice.\n\u201cSooner or later,\u201d Peter allows. \u201cIf I get closer to cracking my way home, maybe. Best case scenario, it\u2019ll only take a few months\u2014but it\u2019s most likely that it\u2019ll take a while to make any kind of heads on this. Could be years.\u201d\nStrangely, Bruce relaxes somewhat at this. \u201cTake as long as you need,\u201d he says emphatically. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome here as long as you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d Peter replies, flashing him a small, grateful smile.\nBruce suddenly clears his throat, becoming a lot more awkward, and makes his way to leave. \u201cThree hours,\u201d he reminds. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be back to take you down for dinner. Tim and Duke will also be wanting to spend some time with you.\u201d\nPeter brightens up at that\u2014Tim and Duke coming back after school are the highlights of his otherwise boring days.\n\u201cAnd no sneaking back in at night,\u201d Bruce adds, noting Peter\u2019s scowl at this. \u201cI\u2019ll find out.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me,\u201d he shoots back. \u201cI can crawl on the ceiling.\u201d Even though he very much can stop him, can literally lock him out of the lab, and while Peter could find a way to break in, he\u2019d also be extremely perceptible to just being picked up and carried back to his bed again.\nBruce seems to realize this, because he doesn\u2019t deign a response back\u2014only gives Peter a  look  and then leaves.\nPeter swivels his chair back around to the desk. \u201cOkay,\u201d he mutters, opening his notebooks to where more than a few designs and theories have been sketched out. \u201cHome.\u201d\nHe gets to work.\n\nIn a semi-alternate universe...\n\n-\n\"They're going to be back any second,\" Dick warns to the group. \"We need a game plan.\"\nTim just squints at Peter. \"Can't you just break the bars?\"\nPeter considers it, but then shakes his head. \"They're charged too high,\" he says ruefully, listening to the distinct sizzling sound from the electrically charged mettal. \"I'd fry up, probably pass out before I can finish the job.\" The kidnappers Peter doesn't know who they are yet have actually thought somewhat far ahead.\nBruce scowls menacingly. It really is a predicament they've gotten into\u2014every single one of the bat crew plus Peter, trapped in a cell by some bad guys who plan to unmask them publicly, live, on whatever channel they hacked into. No back up is coming for them now.\nPeter wracks his brain, comes up with an idea, almost immediately scraps it. \"I have a plan,\" he says slowly. \"I don't know how well it'll work, but... just trust me. Let them come for me first.\"\n\"What are you planning?\" Bruce growls, never one to be left out from scheming. Peter just stares at him blankly from the mask and flashes him a thumbs up.\nWhen the masked men come, Peter makes a point to be as mouthy as possible. All it takes are a few too many\u00a0fuck you's and also a few personal attacks to their fashion sense.\n\"Alright, you're first,\" the lead guy snarls, grabbing Peter by the handcuffs he can definitely break out of. He just has to wait for the right timing to catch them off guard.\nThey lead him to a chair, pretty much throwing him down before strapping it to him. He can hear the sharp, angry inhales coming from the peanut gallery in their cell, but he pays the bats no mind. Just focuses on doing something that he knows will leave his skin feeling itchy for weeks.\nOne of the henchmen turn the camera on, points it straight at Peter. he gives a little wave from where his hands are tied.\n\"Starting off our entertainment tonight is the Spider-Man,\" the lead guy sneers. He hunches over to Peter and threateningly grasps him by the jaw. \"Are you prepared to be exposed, bug boy?\"\n\"I've made my peace with it,\" Peter snarks. \"Stop dancing around and just get it over with, buddy. You're boring me, and I'm hungry.\"\nThe guy thunders, socking him in the stomach to Batman's furious growl before gripping the edge of the mask from where it peaks out under the rest of his suit. Peter prepares himself.\nThe mask lifts over his head.\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK?\"\n\nPeter's face is nonexistent, mass dissolving into an army of spiders that pour out of his body, spilling out of his suit, leaving it entirely empty. During the moment of sheer terror and confusion from the villains of the night, Peter sends a few of his spidery body parts to pick up the keys to the cell from where they've been dropped on the floor by the men in their eagerness to get the fuck away from Peter's consciousness scattered into several thousand spiders.\nHe carries the keys over to the cell, where the bats are watching in open-mouthed horror.\n\"Here you go,\" Peter says, using a fair amount of spiders to morph into a vague-humanoid shape, putting the key into the lock and turning it. A few of the spiders zap and die in the process, and Peter feels the pain acutely, like sharp needles in various points of his body. But the rest of him isn't all that affected.\nThe door swings open.\nThe fight is over before it even began.\nPeter pulls his spider suit back on before morphing back into his own body.\n\"Eugh,\" he says, making a face. \"I hate doing that.\"\nEveryone is staring at him. Even Damian looks at him with an expression that goes past his usual disgust, and is just landing on terrified.\nPeter distantly realizes that he's never quite mentioned this power to them.\nHe embarrassedly rubs the back of his neck. \"Oh, did I forget to mention that I can turn into a body of spiders that have my consciousness?\" It's rhetorical. He already knows he didn't tell them.\nThere's a long, heavy silence. Nobody's even paying attention to the unconscious bad guys who'd been minutes away from unmasking them earlier.\n\"Spider-Man,\" Bruce says, and his voice is uneven in the way that Batman's voice is\u00a0never uneven. There's no growl at all. \"What the fuck.\""
