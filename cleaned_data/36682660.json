    "text": "The Wilbur Van. Act 2\nStream 1: The view from the bottom of the ladder\n\u201cNo, no, no. It\u2019s a good plan, Wilbur,\u201d Tommy said, idly kicking at the sandy dirt around the burger van, \u201cYou just look like a dumbass building a road no-one will use.\u201d He looked up and waited for a reaction.\nThe afternoon was hot and the sun was high in the sky. Wilbur sweltered as he placed metre upon metre of black, bubbling concrete powder into the desert sands. The thermostat was his enemy and the city in the distance shimmered like a mirage. It was a simple plan in his mind. To build a diversion away from Quackity to his burger van, a more appetising meal for the tired wanderer in the deserts of Las Nevadas. Served hot, medium rare and non-fungible. The people would simply rejoice, flocking from far and wide to get a taste of the succulent steak, grilled with american cheese, crispy red onions, lettuce and a single tomato. At least he hoped it was. Wilbur had tried Las Nevadas\u2019 burgers before and they were good. Very good. Ranboo would surely be able to compete but he needed the correct marketing and to devote his energy to the right places. He would show Quackity who was really the mastermind figurehead. The only problem he faced was inaccessibility and infrastructure.\n\u201cShut up, Tommy\u201d He spat, kneeling as he smoothed out another air bubble from his road \u201cPeople will use it. I asked around, everyone said they\u2019d come buy from Wilburger they just didn\u2019t know where it was.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s because they don\u2019t want you to fucking blow them up again.\u201d Tommy muttered. Wilbur chose to ignore this.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because they don\u2019t want Quackity to have a monopoly, actually, Tommy.\u201d Wilbur was visibly exhausted despite little work progress \u201cThey understand the dangers of an uncompetitive economy.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an uncompetitive economy, prick.\u201d Tommy retorted proudly, his smile wiping quickly off his face as Wilbur turned and looked up at him, his eyes casting daggers. \u201cWhat\u203d\u201d Tommy whined, \u201cJesus Christ I\u2019m so bored. You haven\u2019t even served a single burger in the entire time you\u2019ve been doing this van thing.\u201d\nWilbur paused his progress and dropped his weight onto both his palms pressed into the sand.\n\u201cJust get me more concrete, Tommy.\u201d He said quietly. Tommy did not respond. Wilbur turned his head sharply, squinted up into the sun behind Tommy\u2019s silhouette and waited. The silhouette nodded and scampered back to the supply tent down the hill.\nIt had been 4 hours but felt like 10. At least a dozen scorpions had been disturbed in Wilbur\u2019s construction and a king cobra almost brought a sour end to the efforts but still Wilbur persisted. The road would be phenomenal. Wilbur\u2019s Jacket and socks sat in a damp sweaty pile on the junction as he worked smoothing out a stubborn bulge on the edge of the road.\nTommy brought him his concrete. Tommy also brought Wilbur a glass of water. Wilbur took both and said nothing. Tommy paused and walked quietly back to the van.\nAcross the sands in the city, Quackity would watch Wilbur from atop the needle restaurant. He wore a suit, no tie and idly fiddled with a poker chip he took for his own during the casino\u2019s construction. He saw no threat in Wilbur\u2019s activities. So why did he still feel a twinge of stress in his temples whenever he would set up his next competitive venture? Quackity could not determine whether it was guilt, jealousy or simply annoyance at this proverbial fly buzzing \u2018round his soup. He chose to hatch a plan.\nYou see, the mind has a strange way of making one want to react even in situations where to remain idle would benefit it. The mind always wants to throw water on the grease fire, pull-up into an aerodynamic stall and pick at the scab. Quackity always felt a desire to react to his nemesis.\nWilbur would receive Quackity\u2019s summons not long after laying the halfway point of his road in early evening. The irony that Wilbur would be invited inside into a cold Las Nevadas restaurant just as the sweltering sun crested over the hill and began disappearing into the horizon was not lost on him. He smiled and chuckled into a cough before hoisting to his feet and strolling up towards the city lights.\nWilbur thought that the Las Nevadas\u2019 skyline was bare. Propped up haphazardly in the middle of a desert and held together with concrete and tape, there\u2019s not much that could be lost if a tornado swept through the entire place. He had written a poem about it before while ignoring Ranboo, talking about something he was far too interested in.\nI am the gilding of the gold\nI am the painting of the lily\nI am the crushing of the sand\nI am the tirading tide of bland\nI am the taunting silver light which penetrates and scars the sky\nI am the remnant hopes and dreams of all good men that come to die\nI am the surgeon\u2019s chromium dagger\nI am turgid Las Nevadas\nUpon his arrival it didn\u2019t take long for Wilbur and Quackity\u2019s discussion to deteriorate into arguments.\n\u201cAnd for what?\u201d Wilbur shouted, on his feet, arms wide, \u201cyou to overthrow me again? What, you want my van now? Here.\u201d he slammed the key on their table in the empty restaurant.\n\u201cWilbur, I don't want your van,\u201d Quackity said calmly.\n\u201cTake my van!\u201d\n\u201cWilbur, I don\u2019t want your van.\u201d\nA silence fell over the two, Wilbur breathing gently through gritted teeth. Neither of them knew it but the needle restaurant had just rotated it\u2019s 5,000th time.\nQuackity had simply asked Wilbur what he thought of the meal. This had progressed into arguments over the chef\u2019s competence, then Quackity\u2019s competence, then Wilbur\u2019s demeanor.\nAll Quackity needed to ask is if he could take his coat from him.\n\u201cWell what do you want?\u201d Wilbur queried, vaguely gesturing outwards towards other non-existent restaurant patrons. \u201cHuh? You have my money, you have my time. Hell, I\u2019d even say you have my attention.\u201d Quackity raised an eyebrow at Wilbur and he paused. \u201c...Which is a lot for me.\u201d He sunk back into his chair.\nAn innocent onlooker would think Quackity was treating a homeless man to a nice meal. The plates were empty but only Wilbur showed signs of having eaten. The pur\u00e9e stains sat stubbornly on the corners of his mouth and his shirt. Quackity had worn a serviette bib.\n\u201cYou want my dignity\u201d Wilbur opined.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your dignity, Wilbur.\u201d Quackity responded, tersely now, growing tired of Wilbur\u2019s insolence. He forcefully cracked a smile, \u201cAside from your jacket for the cloakroom, I want your wisdom\u201d\n\u201cOh! My wisdom!\u201d Wilbur was standing again, \u201cMy wisdom! Well how about you crack open my head with a meat tenderizer and scoop it out?\u201d Wilbur also cracked a wry smile \u201c...or a pickaxe?\u201d\n\u201cSit down, Wilbur.\u201d Quackity snapped. Wilbur sat.\n\u201cThe thing is, running a nation is hard,\u201d began Quackity, Wilbur\u2019s eyes attempting a roll, \u201cyou have a lot of people depending on you, they invest their lives, their time and their future into your hands\u2026 It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 but they pay through blood, sweat and tears.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I just don\u2019t think I can offer my people the best life on my own.\u201d He continued, \u201cWilbur, I want to offer you a position.\u201d This sentence stirred Wilbur and he finally seemed to have time to listen.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve proven you\u2019re not as volatile anymore, you\u2019re not a threat to me and I think you\u2019re ready to reenter government.\u201d\n\u201cReenter government?\u201d asked Wilbur, \u201cWhat\u2026 but what\u2019s the catch? If I-\u201d\n\u201cNo catch.\u201d Quackity interrupted, placing a contract on the table. A handwritten parchment checked, authorised and checked again in such a thorough way only Quackity could accomplish.\nWilbur paused and for the first time in a long time, began to feel humbled.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can govern your nation, Quackity.\u201d He said softly. \u201cI appreciate the respect you must have for me to put me in a position of power but I just don\u2019t think my reputation would grant anyone the peace of mind you are looking for.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d still be president.\u201d Quackity replied.\n\u201cBut then I\u2019d have to be behind the scenes. What trust can people put in their government if that comes out?\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be behind the scenes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Wilbur breathed, these words falling off his tongue and landing into a short silence.\n\u201cYou\u2019d be a figurehead just as much as I.\u201d Quackity spoke slowly, \u201cWe\u2019d work together.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d want another coalition?\u201d Wilbur asked, \u201cBig Q, I\u2026 I think if I were to be in power I\u2019d want to rule alone.\u201d\n\u201cRule?\u201d There was a further pause, Quackity seemed just as confused as Wilbur for a moment before his eyes lit up and he chuckled. \u201cOh. Oh god no, Wilbur. You wouldn\u2019t rule Las Nevadas.\u201d\nWilbur\u2019s humbled expression began to fade.\n\u201cYou\u2019d be my vice president!\u201d\nSuddenly the world came to an end right in front of them. The words dropped like a guillotine which sliced the entire SMP into two perfect halves. What a coincidence that the apocalyptic guillotine seemed to strike perfectly in the centre of Wilbur\u2019s skull.\nAnd what a coincidence that only Wilbur seemed to see or feel it happen.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you brought me here for?\u201d Wilbur replied shakily, trying to contain his rage, \u201cyou deem me a vice president?\u201d\n\u201cI deem you a qualified leader, yes.\u201d Quackity replied calmly.\n\u201cDo you understand how insulting your charity attempt is?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s insulting. Don\u2019t forget I was once a vice president.\u201d Quackity chuckled.\n\u201cYeah, well I couldn\u2019t stoop that low.\u201d Wilbur slammed his fist on the table and stood up.\n\u201cWilbur, you forget yourself.\u201d Quackity spat\n\u201cHah.\u201d Wilbur replied, mocking Quackity\u2019s intonation \u201cWilbur you forget yourself. Quackity you forget where you stand next to me. You are in my shadow. Act like it.\u201d\nQuackity\u2019s eyes furrowed.\nWilbur continued, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not a coincidence that every single idea you\u2019ve had has failed under your guidance.\u201d he spoke his next sentence slowly, one word at a time. \u201cYou are a walking second place medal.\u201d\n\u201cYet you are the one who lost an election even when you tried to rig it.\u201d Quackity snapped. Like a whip, almost as soon as he had finished his last word, Wilbur was struck out of his rage. \u201cGet out of my nation.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re kicking me out?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Leave.\u201d\nThere was a pause. Wilbur glanced around the restaurant, taking in everything he could before his ejection.\n\u201cHow about we organise a way for me to lead a branch of your government?\u201d Wilbur seemed to be begging.\nQuackity was unmoved. \u201cAny more words used on you would be a waste of both our time.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Quackity, you're a smart man-\u201d\nQuackity snapped, \u201cIf you really valued my intelligence you wouldn\u2019t need to remind me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be out of your hair, you\u2019ll never have to think about me again, I-\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think about you at all.\u201d Quackity replied, Wilbur\u2019s face plummeted.\nA silence fell across the room only broken by a gentle squeak of the rotating cogs. Quackity shattered the silence like ice;\n\u201cOh, Wilbur. How relaxing it must be to have a mind unburdened by embarrassment.\u201d\nThe elevator pinged and opened in front of him. Through Wilbur\u2019s apparent numbing red mist he somehow managed to navigate his index finger to the ground floor button and after holding it for what an onlooker would deem a \u2018questionably long time\u2019 released it to a satisfying elevator ping. Tommy would be waiting for him at the bottom of the restaurant, idly pouring sand between his two hands.\n\u201cWilbur! How was it?\u201d he asked, standing up and walking towards him. \u201cDid you steal his eyes? I would\u2019ve stolen his eyes but I\u2019m built different.\u201d\nWilbur didn\u2019t really answer, staring past Tommy and towards a knocked over outdoor patio chair covered in sand. He smiled, shook his head and replied,\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere left to go but up.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Wilbur Van. Act 2\nStream 2: Horseplay\nRanboo missed a lot of things from back home. Being on the outskirts wasn\u2019t all it was cracked up to be from Wilbur\u2019s persuasion. He missed his home, he missed Tubbo and he missed Michael. Still, Ranboo saw something in Wilbur. He saw a man trying his best to carve out a legacy and a man at his lowest trying to gain redemption. But unfortunately he also saw a man with an insatiable pride, a man who was a living bomb about to explode and, scariest of all, he saw a bit of himself.\nTubbo walked out the back of the Las Nevadas burger bar and bumped into Ranboo who was sitting on the hill.\n\u201cOh! Hi, Ranboo\u201d Tubbo chirped as he dumped a garbage bag full of old food into the dumpster.\n\u201cHey, Tubbo!\u201d Ranboo chimed back at him with a wave,\n\u201cJust hanging out by the bins, huh?\u201d\n\u201cYou know me.\u201d Ranboo scratched his cheek and an awkward silence fell over the two. Ranboo wanted to tell Tubbo he missed hanging out. Surely Wilbur wouldn\u2019t mind if they just went for a walk between shifts?\n\u201cHey, I wanted to ask-\u201d they both said in unison and laughed.\n\u201cYou first\u201d Ranboo insisted\n\u201cOkay! I wanted to know if you wanted to come into the restaurant for something to eat? Big Q said I can have anyone round after my shift is done as long as they purchase something at least $20\u201d Tubbo smiled and Ranboo felt a wave of relief over him.\n\u201cI was gonna ask you pretty much the same thing.\u201d He said\n\u201cReally?\u201d Tubbo shouted incredulously\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019d\u2026 I\u2019d need to ask Wilbur though, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s keen on me hanging out in the city.\u201d\n\u201cI can bring the food out to you! We can eat across the borders!\u201d Tubbo suggested, \u201cLook! I can even bring out a table and chairs and we can push them down the hill at the end of our meal and see which one rolls the farthest! I have this theory that the chairs will go further simply because they have a tall rounded back and the tables can only go so far before they land on their top-side. It\u2019s like a 50/50 chance really.\u201d Tubbo unfastened his cooking apron and scrunched it into a ball in his hands.\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d Ranboo said, all of his worries washing away in an instant.\nThe meal ended up being superb. Ranboo, who seemed unable to turn down Tubbo\u2019s plentiful offerings of a meal he called \u2018far-too-much-food\u2019, slowly, pissedly staggered down the hill back towards the burger van where he could only make out the faint shape of Wilbur smoking a cigarette. Ranboo approached him timidly. Wilbur stood in front of the van door, he only did this when he was about to ask Ranboo to do something intimidating. Ranboo was right.\nWilbur had plans for a heist this evening.\nThe plan was, under the cover of darkness, to steal Quackity\u2019s prize horse \u2018Boner\u2019. Boner had been named during a more whimsical time in Quackity\u2019s life when he was less weathered by the winds of responsibility. Wilbur knew it well as one of the only things Quackity brought with him from old L\u2019manberg to Las Nevadas. It obviously meant the world to him.\nRanboo had his reservations and debated declining Wilbur\u2019s offer but Wilbur persisted by playing on the concept of the greater good. For how else would they topple the obelisk of tyranny if they didn\u2019t start at the foundations? After all, it was a tame heist all things considered and Ranboo would do well for his job prospects to accept.\nIn this hollow fact Ranboo found himself an accomplice once more.\nYou would expect a criminal to wrap themselves in jet black silks or camouflage jumpsuits but Wilbur simply wore burgundy. Ranboo tried to at least primarily drape himself in the blacks from his wardrobe but Wilbur almost teased the idea of being caught in the act.\n\u201cNot even a black coat?\u201d Ranboo asked\n\u201cGotta make the heart beat somehow, Ranbus.\u201d Wilbur responded, stuffing a handful of fries into his mouth.\nAs the clock struck midnight the pair began ascending the hill towards the city. The only lights guiding their path were those reflected from the glowstone in the fountain, scattering a bouncing effervescent pattern across the walls of the city buildings. The streetlights were all completely devoid of light. Las Nevadas had no need for streetlights in the early hours of the morning so switched them off to allow it\u2019s few citizens a sleep undisrupted by light pollution.\nThe two snuck quietly to the corner of Tubbo\u2019s burger restaurant and Wilbur raised his fist to signal Ranboo to stop. He checked their surroundings before opening his palm and walking out into the street.\nRanboo was scared. Maybe he was excited. Ranboo struggled to tell the difference between the two sometimes.\nSculking past the restaurant, crawling behind the strip club and sneaking between two construction sites lay a small paddock. Constructed out of shoulder-height wooden fences left over from the building efforts. There, stood gormlessly in the sand, was Boner.\n\u201cTake this.\u201d Wilbur said, passing Ranboo a crude rope fashioned into a leash. Ranboo took the leash and Wilbur climbed into the field and delicately tied the other end to Boner\u2019s neck.\n\u201cWilbur, I don\u2019t think I want to hold the horse.\u201d Ranboo protested, limply gripping his end of the leash in his hands. Wilbur snatched it like a ripcord.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re scared, We\u2019ll do it together.\u201d He winked at Ranboo before leading Boner to the edge of the paddock. Ranboo removed two wooden panels from the fencing allowing Wilbur and the horse to walk out of the field and into the streets. The three conspicuously began walking back to the van.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before they were spotted.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d asked Tubbo quietly, cleaning his windows as they approached his burger restaurant.\n\u201cNone of your business, Tubbo.\u201d Wilbur responded, \u201cEyes to yourself.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s Quackity\u2019s horse.\u201d he spoke, louder this time.\n\u201cOh geez. Ranboo, I don\u2019t have time for this, you deal with him.\u201d Wilbur scrambled down the hill, yanking Boner quickly away from the scene.\nRanboo took a few small steps towards Tubbo, \u201cHey, man, maybe you should go back inside.\u201d\n\u201cBig Q told me to take care of that horse.\u201d Tubbo replied, \u201cI\u2019ve been feeding him every day.\u201d\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s in safe hands.\u201d Ranboo lied. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna hold him ransom but you know Wilbur would never hurt it. He\u2019s too soft.\u201d\n\u201cNo he\u2019s not.\u201d Tubbo blurted, a tremble in his voice. \u201cBring the horse back. Now.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Tubbo.\u201d Ranboo said, trying to be firm. Tubbo, unperturbed by Ranboo\u2019s stature over him, dropped his cleaning rag.\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna end up hurting him. Even if you don\u2019t intend to, you will. Wilbur always hurts innocent things and it\u2019s not fair. The horse did nothing wrong.\u201d Ranboo didn\u2019t respond. He just stood there, slightly hunched staring down at the boy.\n\u201cRanboo, make him bring the horse back.\u201d Tubbo begged quietly, his voice sounding trembly, diminished and tired.\n\u201cNo, Tubbo.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna have to tell Big Q\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell Big Q. Tubbo, It\u2019s for the greater good.\u201d\nTubbo felt his rage build up inside him, \u201cNothing Wilbur does is for the greater good! He takes and he takes and everything is his own little mission of revenge. Can\u2019t you see? He\u2019s made you think you and him are alike but you\u2019re not. Ranboo, you\u2019re better than this I-\u201d Ranboo felt the fuse inside him finally reach it\u2019s payload.\n\u201cTubbo!\u201d he snapped \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, just give him a chance! I know that I haven\u2019t always made the best decisions with who I trust but this time I swear to you that things may not always be as bad as you think! I mean, People change, people get better and if you never give them a chance to prove it you\u2019ll be stuck hating everyone that has ever wronged you and you won\u2019t have anyone left...\u201d\nA silence fell over the two. Tubbo\u2019s eyes began to wet and he quickly turned around and walked away. Down the hill Wilbur cheered and lit up another cigarette \u201cAtta boy, Ranbus!\u201d he gloated.\nRanboo felt sick.\nThe next day, back in paradise on the outskirts of Las Nevadas, beneath the oak trees by the lake, Wilbur and Tommy\u2019s HQ was buzzing with light. A welding torch was scattering sparks like fireflies in the dark evening light as a very tired Tommy methodically lined redstone on the hard rocky floor. Quackity would surely have seen it from his window in Las Nevadas, however he was asleep, ready for his usual early morning rise.\nTommy focussed intently on his job, negating his exhaustion as much as possible, only letting his focus slip occasionally to quip something funny to Wilbur. Wilbur enjoyed the company and laughed along but fretted for the handiwork of Tommy\u2019s wiring. For if a single piece of the red powder was not connected properly the entire circuit would break.\n\u201cWilbur,\u201d Tommy asked with a whining inflection\n\u201cYes, Tommy?\u201d Wilbur responded, muffled by the welding mask strapped to his face.\nTommy sniffed and wiped his nose on his forearm, \u201cHow do you know this plan will work?\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what plan I come up with.\u201d Wilbur replied \u201cAll Quackity wants to make sure is that I\u2019m not winning.\u201d\nWilbur\u2019s mind worked like a firework. He would have intense flashes of an idea and a storm-like energy coupled with it but found it hard to maintain that energy further into his work. It was as if two minds sat in his skull, one who sat dormant on a lounging recliner, sipping gently on lemonade and watching the mess through two miopic windows. The other half sat at the helm; clueless, scared but confident. Occasionally the reclining mind would speak up and present an ingenious idea then fall back to languor. The working mind would then slog the task.\nNonetheless, he felt he had gotten this far in life by following his gut and chasing those storms, he had grown so accustomed to perseverance the next time the firework bloomed it would greet him as an old friend.\nThis firework had bloomed in the form of vengeance.\nWilbur had set up a marvelous trap. Rigged to an explosive device was a pressure plate, bending the wires in such a way as to only be triggered upon the plate\u2019s release. Meaning the TNT would only detonate not when someone stands on top of it, but only when they step off of it afterwards. This plate was a stone one, meaning any person or creature could set the trap off.\n\u201cSo why did you choose Quackity\u2019s horse?\u201d Tommy asked.\n\u201cEasy to get a hold of.\u201d Wilbur chuckled, \u201cQuackity doesn\u2019t really care about that horse, I\u2019m just showing him a fraction of what I can do.\u201d\nQuackity\u2019s horse \u2018Boner\u2019 obliviously chewed old carpet across the room from them, completely unaware he was about to be detonated because he is a horse that cannot speak English.\n\u201cBut how do you know this for sure?\u201d Tommy asked\n\u201cI just do.\u201d Wilbur answered, a little more sharply than usual.\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve said stuff like this before and it wasn\u2019t true. You\u2019ve got a bit of a track record of lying.\u201d Tommy said\n\u201cI have never lied to you.\u201d Wilbur spoke firmly. The atmosphere of fun and whimsy quickly drained from the room.\n\u201cI mean\u2026\u201d Tommy began, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019ve had so many people lie to me including you.\u201d\nWilbur shook his head, \u201cI\u2019ve never lied to you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the pit? What about the stuff you said about Tubbo betraying us in L\u2019Manberg? what about when you said no-one would hurt Tubbo?\u201d\nWilbur lifted his mask\n\u201cIf I truly believed it was the truth, does that make me a liar?\u201d\nTommy thought for a moment. \u201cWell, not exactly but-\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the difference between me and Schlatt. That\u2019s the difference between me and Phil. That\u2019s the difference between me and Quackity.\u201d The sparks had stopped flying so it was impossible to make out Wilbur\u2019s facial expressions as he spoke. \u201cI have never lied to you. I have been wrong but never lied to you, Tommy. I won\u2019t lie to you. Do you trust me, Tommy? \u2018Cos right now I feel like you don\u2019t trust me.\u201d\nThese words Wilbur spoke, these words that had calmed the strongest men and built entire nations had no effect on Tommy anymore. They just made him a little frightened. Tommy had heard Wilbur speak like this many times but it never got easier. He felt he had done something wrong simply by posing his point of view and he felt like the antagonist when all he wanted was an answer.\n\u201cI trust you Wilbur.\u201d He said quietly.\nWilbur brought his visor back down and carried on his work.\nAfter a long night, the trap was set. The two went to bed, Wilbur slept soundly and deeply whilst Tommy stayed awake.\nTubbo was wrong. The table rolled the farthest.\nWilbur Van Act 2\nStream 3: Hitting on 16\nTommy left to go home early in the morning of the day of Wilbur\u2019s plan. It was a cold morning but the summer sun had just started to evaporate the dew leaving a humid mist in Tommy\u2019s wake as he walked up the half-finished highway and towards the forests leading into the Dream SMP. Tubbo also stirred early, having had trouble sleeping the nights prior he decided to make use of his time and try to get work done. He donned his apron, cleaned the friers and started his shift. It didn\u2019t matter, as no patrons even strolled past, but Tubbo forgot to flip the closed sign to open. Surely there was more to his job than this? Tubbo was Big Q\u2019s prize coworker and, almost out of spite, Tubbo felt he had something to prove. If not to Quackity then to Ranboo.\nRanboo hadn\u2019t slept. He went for a walk, toeing the outskirts of the city and visiting the Las Nevadas rendition of the Eiffel Tower. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t seem to switch his brain on, it was as if the morning humidity had permeated his skull and every one of his thoughts simply disappeared into the fog as soon as they were made.\nWilbur awoke with a spring in his step.\nUnder the lake by the burger van, just below the sandstone holding up the topsoil sat Wilbur\u2019s contraption, currently un-primed. The wires were redirected from the TNT to a simple redstone lamp. Wilbur lay, belly down on the stone floor, gently pressing onto the trigger and releasing it, satisfied that the lamp illuminated upon doing so. A smile grew wider across his face as he repeated this quietly to himself again and again. Boner the horse had been moved, now tied up in this cavern, dehydrated and hungry. Wilbur had more important things on his mind.\nConstructed on one side of this cavern was a glass viewing bay, just out of range of the TNT blast and accessible from Wilbur and Tommy\u2019s HQ where the redstone had been programmed. This platform, behind the reinforced glass with Wilbur sat next to him, was where Quackity was to watch his horse die.\nAs Wilbur started to stand up, the trapdoor hatch to the viewing platform swung open scattering natural light into the otherwise dimly lit cave. Wilbur squinted into the morning sun as Ranboo began to descend the ladder.\n\u201cRanboo!\u201d Wilbur cheered \u201cYou ready for the big day? I know you\u2019re not much of a fan of horse viscera so you don\u2019t have to sit in the viewing bay during detonation. Look, I made you a little trap door here;\u201d he gestured up to another trapdoor on the ceiling of the TNT room \u201cwhen the explosion has occurred you\u2019re welcome to come join us down here to see Big Q\u2019s reaction. You won\u2019t want to miss that. There\u2019s a ladder to the viewing platform here.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to use that trapdoor.\u201d Ranboo replied, bags under his eyes and a tired croak in his voice. \u201cI swore to never enter that section of the cave. There\u2019s too much TNT.\u201d\n\u201cWell, by the time you use it, Ranboo I hope the TNT has already left the room\u201d Wilbur chuckled into a cough. \u201cIf you won\u2019t use the second trapdoor I\u2019ll just remove it. No biggy.\u201d\nThe viewing bay was adorned with decorations, a sign that read \u2018Thank you! Happy day!\u2019 was scrawled in a childlike font just next to a fake exit door. An equally childlike painting hung on the wall depicting Wilbur and Quackity as stick figures, Wilbur on a #1 podium and Quackity sat on the #3 podium with a storm cloud over his head. Ranboo is drawn in slightly more detail holding a big thumbs up on the #2 podium.\n\u201cIs there anything I can get for you, Wilbur?\u201d Ranboo asked with a flat tone.\n\u201cOh, Ranbus! A lemonade and first edition Wilburger!\u201d Wilbur replied, he looked down and saw his hands covered in dirt and soot from the cave walls \u201cI\u2019ll come up with you to wash my hands. Afterwards we should go and get Big Q, it\u2019s his big day after all!\u201d\nRanboo nodded and exited the viewing bay via the trapdoor. Wilbur switched off the lights and followed him.\nQuackity quietly sat in his office listening to the methodic ticking of the grandfather clock by the door. His work already finished by 8am he slowly sipped on a brandy and reclined his chair as far back as he could go without spilling it. With a sigh and a push of his feet he managed to glide his seat over to his window and began scanning the horizon. The sand on the hill seemed to dance as the heat bounced off of it. Quackity maneuvered his desk fan to his trajectory and yawned. There was nothing to do. If there was another person in his room he would\u2019ve tried harder to contain his excitement as Wilbur crested the Las Nevadas boundary.\n\u201cWe take Quackity into the viewing bay, flip the lights on and show him his horse primed on the plate.\u201d Wilbur began to Ranboo as they trudged up the sandy hill once more \u201cThen we explain how the system works. When Quackity has understood the ingenious complexity of the contraption, I pull a carrot from my inventory and watch as his dumb horse strolls towards us, detonating itself and the entire cave. Quackity cries, we laugh, Quackity never messes with me again.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t want to be vice president\u201d Ranboo interjects\n\u201cBecause I shouldn\u2019t stoop as low as to be vice president, Ranbus my boy\u201d Wilbur said, correcting him and placing a hand on his shoulder, \u201cand besides, I\u2019m president of the best damn burger van with the best damn chef around.\u201d Ranboo smiled.\nThe pair continued past Tubbo\u2019s burger restaurant, closed and with Tubbo not inside, Then to the grand casino building, the two knocked on the side door to the administration offices.\nOne would expect at least a security detail for Quackity but alas, Wilbur and Ranboo were able to effortlessly navigate the admin building with not so much as a locked door. Reams and reams of documentation lined the corridors as filing cabinets seemed to be in short supply. Each document was as confusing as it was elaborate, signed off meticulously with Big Q\u2019s signature. He was a beaurocrat after all. The pair approached a large mahogany door with a golden Q emblazoned on the front, the smell inside the room was so strong it penetrated the corridor they were standing in, old books and cologne; a casino. Wilbur knocked three times with the blunt end of his fist and a voice, almost auditioned, beckoned them inside. He turned the handle and swung open the door to reveal Quackity, sitting at his desk with three glasses in front of him. He flipped a poker chip idly between his fingers and posed as if he was preparing for a photograph. Wilbur contrasted the scene by immediately clearing phlegm from his throat,\n\u201cQuackity! How are you?\u201d Wilbur asked, taking in the scene\n\u201cI\u2019m doing marvelous, Wilbur, yourself?\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t be better.\u201d There was an awkward pause and Quackity almost dropped his poker chip.\n\u201cPlease, take a seat.\u201d Quackity insisted, standing up and pouring the two of them a drink, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see you back here so soon.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean, me neither. But I just had to come in person.\u201d\n\u201cIs this about my offer? It still stands. I think you\u2019d make a great vice president, Wilbur.\u201d Quackity offered with a smile, a vein bulged on Wilbur\u2019s forehead.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m here, Quackity and I think you know that.\u201d Wilbur said, cranking out the most realistic laugh he could manage \u201cI actually have a gift for you.\u201d\n\u201cA gift?\u201d Quackity\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cwell where is it? I\u2019d love a gift.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s back in paradise. The burger van.\u201d\n\u201cAt the burger van? Is it too big to carry?\u201d\n\u201cOh, very much so.\u201d Wilbur responded with a smile. \u201cCome,\u201d he continued, \u201clet\u2019s take you there now.\u201d\nEvery part of Quackity\u2019s being could tell this was the most simple trap he\u2019d ever seen. Wilbur was most likely aware of how suspicious he looked but most likely did not care.\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll bite.\u201d Quackity said, sitting back down \u201cwhat\u2019s the catch? You\u2019re gonna take me back and leave Ranboo here to graffiti my office? I\u2019ve seen your graffiti, Wilbur, it\u2019s not good. You need to use primers when you draw penises on our city walls we can just wash them off otherwise, it took the janitors five minutes to-\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not graffiti.\u201d Wilbur interrupted. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift. An actual real life gift. I wanted to say sorry for snapping at you in the restaurant the other day.\u201d Wilbur almost sounded sincere and, for a moment, Quackity was intrigued.\nWilbur only needed this moment, because five minutes later the three of them were strolling back to the burger van, Quackity being flanked by the two of them, Ranboo not saying a word.\nThe air was still. Birds seemed to leave the area around the van in anticipation of what was to come and the sun dipped behind a patch of gray clouds just as the day was reaching its climax.\nWilbur, despite designing the TNT to be the perfect distance from injuring himself or Quackity, failed to measure the distance between it and the van. He hoped instead his rough design under the water of the lake would allow protection for all the surface damage. He also failed to actually test if the redstone line was connected to the TNT as he was too afraid of setting off the dynamite too early. As they approached the van all of these thoughts danced in Wilbur\u2019s mind and a single bead of sweat dripped down Wilbur\u2019s head. His heart pounded in his chest and he felt alive.\n\u201cQuackity.\u201d Wilbur tapped Big Q on the shoulder, \u201cDown there.\u201d\nQuackity looked down at the trapdoor inside the HQ and then back up to Wilbur. With a little hesitation, Quackity gently raised the hatch and took in the sight of a totally dark room, stirred with dust and smelling of sulfur. He turned back to Wilbur who was eagerly waiting, with a straight posture, smiling in anticipation. Quackity, never one to disappoint, descended the ladder into the darkness. Wilbur and Ranboo followed behind and shut the trapdoor.\n\u201cNow, Quackity\u201d Wilbur began, \u201cYou may be wondering why I\u2019ve brought you here.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly guess, Wilbur\u201d Quackity responded, the three of them completely blind in the darkness.\n\u201cWell I have to come clean.\u201d Wilbur continued, \u201cThere is no gift. For you at least.\u201d\nQuackity\u2019s eyes rolled as he feigned surprise, \u201cI never saw this coming.\u201d he replied.\n\u201cYou know your horse? Boner?\u201d Wilbur asked with a malicious grin.\n\u201cMy\u2026 My horse?\u201d Quackity grew concerned, \u201cYes, I know my horse, what have you done with my horse?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t forget about it. Just like you did with everything else from your past life.\u201d\n\u201cWilbur, what have you done to my horse?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Quackity. It\u2019s not so much what I\u2019ve done! No! Rather what your horse is about to do to itself!\u201d Wilbur exclaimed with a manic laugh. He walked over to the wall and pulled the lever as suddenly the entire room was flooded with lamplight. A gentle hum overtook the background noise as the three men\u2019s eyes started to adjust to the new surroundings.\nThere was no horse.\nThere, stood on the primed pressure plate, scared as all hell, was Tubbo.\n\u201cI found your horse, Big Q.\u201d Tubbo said, a shake in his voice, \u201cI think he\u2019s on the surface now.\u201d\n\u201cWilbur, what the fuck is this?\u201d Quackity asked, rage building in him as his hands trembled into a fist, \u201cWhat\u2019s all that TNT for?\u201d\nWilbur\u2019s face plummeted as he realized what he had done. \u201cOh no. No, no, no, no, no.\u201d Wilbur shook his head, \u201cTubbo, how did you get there? Tubbo, don\u2019t move!\u201d Wilbur shouted down into the cave, a huge dose of terror in his voice.\n\u201cI went to find Quackity\u2019s horse.\u201d Tubbo shouted back, \u201cI only saw he was rigged to explode after I swapped places with him. If I stand still will it still trigger? I don\u2019t want to die, Wilbur.\u201d\nRanboo scrambled up the ladder to go find help.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t die, Tubbo, it\u2019s fine just stay still I\u2019m coming to get you.\u201d Wilbur said, placing his palm against the glass\n\u201cWilbur, What have you done?\u201d Quackity asked, shoving Wilbur against the glass of the viewing platform. It creaked gently under their weight. \u201cYou want to kill Tubbo to prove a point? You knew he\u2019d come to my aid.\u201d\n\u201cQuackity, this- this isn\u2019t what I was intending I- I- I was gonna blow up your horse.\u201d Wilbur was interrupted as Quackity struck him in the stomach with a single punch. Wilbur recoiled with a groan and slumped down to his knees. \u201cQuackity, please I can fix this.\u201d he stuttered.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done enough\u201d Quackity spat before averting his attention to Tubbo, \u201cTubbo, how can we get you out of there?\u201d\nWilbur darted between Quackity\u2019s knees and picked up the fake exit door and hurled it at the glass creating a small crack across its surface. \u201cTubbo, I\u2019m coming to save you!\u201d he yelled.\n\u201cThank you, Wilbur.\u201d Tubbo stammered. Wilbur picked up the door again for another throw but before he could even lift it Quackity had tackled him to the ground.\n\u201cI said you\u2019ve done enough, Wilbur.\u201d Quackity said, overpowering him, desperately struggling to pick up the door again, blood trickling down from his nose.\nAgain, Quackity turned his attention to Tubbo, \u201cTubbo, don\u2019t move! What can I do to help?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Big Q.\u201d Tubbo began, \u201cI guess you could drop water on the TNT?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Wilbur exclaimed, \u201cThe TNT will just explode the second the redstone circuit is broken.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a sick fuck, Wilbur.\u201d Quackity said, turning his attention back to the terrorist he was pinning down. \u201cYou\u2019re a pathetic spineless bastard!\u201d\n\u201cShut up and help me then!\u201d Wilbur shouted, \u201cStart trying to break the glass!\u201d\nQuackity ignored him, \u201cTubbo, how did you get in? We can just go over and get you out the way you came in!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember, Big Q!\u201d Tubbo responded, \u201cI- I dug my way in, I think Boner got out that way.\u201d\nQuackity muttered something under his breath before releasing Wilbur from his grip and grabbing the door to launch once more at the glass. Wilbur sprung to his feet and grappled the door, struggling to snatch it out of Quackity\u2019s hands.\n\u201cLet me do this, Quackity. I got Tubbo into this mess, I\u2019ll get him out!\u201d Wilbur exclaimed, attempting to wrench the door out of Quackity\u2019s grasp.\n\u201cHe\u2019s my citizen! I won\u2019t let a citizen of my government die to a terrorist!\u201d Quackity shouted back, refusing to relinquish the door. After a few seconds of struggling, Quackity began trying to kick Wilbur. A flurry of four swift kicks erupted forwards, missing their target before one landed squarely against the body of the door, breaking it into two halves. Wilbur immediately chucked his half of the door against the glass doing very little damage due to the loss in mass.\nHe cried out in rage and began scrambling on the stone floor. The two, too out of breath to speak, began searching frantically around for an item to hurl at the glass before Wilbur found a sizable rock against the boundary of the room. He held it above his head ready to throw before Quackity tackled him once again and tried to wrestle the rock out of his grip. Tubbo watched as the two struggled for what felt like an hour trying to take the rock from one another before Wilbur finally swung it against Quackity\u2019s jaw, knocking him across the room and releasing Wilbur from the grapple.\nImmediately, Wilbur threw the rock against the glass, causing it to bounce back across the room. Quackity, now prone, grasped the rock in his hands and threw it over his body directly into the center of the glass pane, shattering it into a thousand pieces. Wilbur recoiled from the explosion of glass shards and fell backwards giving Quackity time to right himself.\n\u201cTubbo, just-\u201d Quackity began, panting out of breath, before Wilbur launched himself against Quackity\u2019s knees once more, knocking him to the floor.\n\u201cYou never cared about Tubbo, you just care about your image, you maniac.\u201d Wilbur shouted, spitting blood as he attempted to pin Quackity\u2019s arms down, \u201cYou just don\u2019t want anyone to know that you failed to protect the one person who still cares about you.\u201d\n\u201cTubbo is my friend as much as he\u2019s my citizen! I\u2019ll protect him at any cost\u201d Quackity responded before biting down hard on Wilbur\u2019s arm. Wilbur released his grip and Quackity easily stood up and began to swing his fist across the side of Wilbur\u2019s head. The viewing platform shook and erupted in a fist fight as the two violently attacked each other, neither party seeming to get the upper hand.\nIt\u2019s at this point Ranboo broke through the rock above the cave, scattering gray sunlight into the room.\nNeither Quackity nor Wilbur saw him collapse into the room and walk up to an increasingly frightened Tubbo. Ranboo placed a single foot onto the pressure plate, put a hand on Tubbo\u2019s shoulder and said,\n\u201cTubbo, you need to move. I have a plan\u201d\nWithout hesitation Tubbo scrambled towards the ladder connecting the cavern to the viewing platform and climbed it. He turned back to look at Ranboo who smiled at him with the kind eyes he remembered. Tubbo smiled back.\nOnce Tubbo had ascended the ladder and curled up in the corner Ranboo began to shout.\n\u201cWilbur! Quackity!\u201d\nThe two immediately stopped fighting and looked down at the new voice. Ranboo stood firmly on the pressure plate.\n\u201cRanboo?\u201d Quackity said, a cold shot dragging down his spine, \u201cWhere\u2019s-?\u201d he looked to his left and saw Tubbo, curled up in the corner with his eyes firmly shut.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, guys.\u201d Ranboo began, Wilbur immediately began rushing to enter the main cave before Ranboo raised a hand.\n\u201cStop!\u201d he shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t come closer, stay in the viewing platform.\u201d\n\u201cRanboo, I\u2019ll go find something heavy stay there\u201d Wilbur began but was interrupted by Ranboo shaking his head\n\u201cI have an idea,\u201d he began, his words echoing around the cave, \u201cI know what to do. I know how to defuse the bomb and make you realise how frivolous this whole thing is.\u201d he smiled\n\u201cBut tell me, Wilbur and Quackity\u2026 The burgers were good, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Wilbur answered, instantly reacting, \u201cThey\u2019re the best. Ranboo and they\u2019ll continue to be the best, let me get you out.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Wilbur, I just wanted to know is all.\u201d \n\u201cBut it was never about the burgers was it?\u201d Ranboo said. Ranboo smiled. Ranboo jumped.\nSearing flames and a violent burst of air was all that was left.\nFor a change, the world really did end.\nWilbur felt alive."
