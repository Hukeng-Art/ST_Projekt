    "text": "The 46th main scenario, Proof of the Stars.[The scenario\u2019s time limit has ended.]\n[The room star has failed to be acquired.]\n[Nobody hurt their companion.]\nA perfect resolution to Kim Dokja\u2019s long awaited return.\n[You have proven your \u2018trust.\u2019]\n[You have acquired a new story!]\n[You have met the conditions to clear the scenario.]\nYes\u2026 this is the \u201ctrue\u201d ending for the Proof of Stars scenario.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d\nThis is definitely how the story ends. With no lingering tension...\u201cKim Dokja. Is there a hidden clear method?\u201d\nA fitting finale to cement all misunderstandings between Yoo Joonghyuk and Kim Dokja\u2026\u00a0\n\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d \nAnd he, Kim Dokja, did not get teleported anywhere. Definitely not in some sketchy, western-style five-star luxury hotel room, with a single king size bed. Kim Dokja didn\u2019t confirm that the cheap silkworm sheets are also of expensive quality, with a high thread count. And definitely didn\u2019t mentally confirm that the bed is large enough for two adult males.\u00a0\nThere is no seductive mood suffused within this space, with the trashy, embossed chandelier hung from the center of the ceiling; the crude, intricate designs carved sloppily in the grenadilla branches. There are no candles; the lights glowing from the carving are enough to embrace the room in a dim, alluring light. Enough to see one another\u2019s features, but dark enough to cast soft shadows.Kim Dokja is definitely not present in this room. He\u2019s off with the rest of his colleagues from his company, confirming the results from the main scenario they just completed, \u201cProof of the Stars\u201d.\u00a0\nAgain, because this bears repeating: Kim Dokja is  not  here.\n\u300c Kim Do kja is stu pid \u2026 \u300d\nYoo Joonghyuk huffs, and grabs Kim Dokja\u2019s collar with both of his hands. He jerks him closer, brushing their noses together. Narrows his eyes and glares; tries to make Kim Dokja look at him. But there\u2019s no point in doing that, when all Kim Dokja can see is Yoo Joonghyuk. Since the very beginning.\nStill, Kim Dokja tries to lower his gaze, his dark lashes fluttering faintly against the stark whiteness of his cheeks. His heart thumps loudly in his chest. It\u2019s so loud, he can\u2019t hear it resonating from Yoo Joonghyuk. Can\u2019t hear them beating in tandem.\n\u201cKim Dokja, you bastard. What did you do?\u201d\n\u00a0His thumbs brush against Kim Dokja\u2019s neck, catching on the beads of sweat.\u00a0\n\u300cKim Do kja wants his hands around his throat \u300d\nThis finally elicits a reaction from Kim Dokja, who blushes a fiery red. He shakes his head.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d His voice cracks. He abruptly shuts his mouth, biting on his tongue. The blush has spread to the lobe of his ears.\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk stares.\u00a0\n\u201cExplain.\u201d\u00a0\nKim Dokja trembles. How exactly is he supposed to explain this? The holographic message flickers, as if teasing him.\n\u00a0\n[Hidden Scenario\u00a0 \u2013 The Fall of a Star]\nCategory: Hidden\nDifficulty: ???\nClear Conditions: Penetrative \u25fc\u25fc with incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk. Minimum of 5 \u25fc\u25fc.\nTime Limit: 24 Hours\nCompensation: 10,000 coins + ???\nFailure: Death\n[What happens in this subspace will not be recorded within \u2039STAR STREAM\u203a]\n\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk releases his collar, and encases his hands around Kim Dokja\u2019s neck. His calloused palms are warm. Immediately, Kim Dokja grabs Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s wrists.\u00a0\n\u300c Kim Dok ja thinks : that\u2019s bett er \u300d\nNo it is not, thinks Kim Dokja.\u00a0\nBut Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s fingers tighten against his throat, and Kim Dokja\u2019s blood rushes straight to his dick.\n\u201cKim Dokja,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk says. \u201cYou know nothing of this?\u201d\nKim Dokja opens his mouth and closes it. Opens his mouth and. And. Closes it. Opens again. Exhales.\u00a0\nHis mouth is getting dry. Better close it, in that case.\nYoo Joonghyuk observes this with a quirk of his eyebrows.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d His voice cracks again. \u201c I don\u2019t know anything about this.\u201d\n[The character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has used the \u2018Lie Detection\u2019 skill.]\n[Your statement has been confirmed to be false.]\nFuck!Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s eyes darken. His fingers dig in his throat.\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk,  fuck! I\u2019ll talk, stop choking me!\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d replies Yoo Joonghyuk. But he doesn\u2019t release the pressure, resting his thumbs gently against the Adam\u2019s apple of Kim Dokja\u2019s throat. A heavy, undeniable presence. Kim Dokja gulps, causing Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s fingers to sink further in his throat. He wishes he didn\u2019t need to breathe.\n\u201cFirst things first,\u201d he chokes out, hating how his voice has reached a particularly high, needy tone.\n\u201cThis.... particular scenario doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me. I didn\u2019t plan this!\u201d\n[The character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has used the \u2018Lie Detection\u2019 skill.]\n[Your statement has been confirmed to be the truth.]\nYoo Joonghyuk hums. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want this?\u201d\nKim Dokja looks at him indignantly. \u201cWhy would I want to fuck you?\u201d\u00a0\nHe\u2019s always been good at lying to himself.\nYoo Joonghyuk frowns. Perhaps he feels insulted because he\u2019s the protagonist. It\u2019s common knowledge that by default, everyone wants to fuck the protagonist. And anyone who doesn\u2019t want to is lying. Good thing for the both of them that Kim Dokja isn\u2019t a character in this novel\u2012 Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s protagonist halo doesn\u2019t affect him. Can\u2019t.\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk tilts his head. The lights from the chandelier pulses warmly over his red, full lips. Kim Dokja is momentarily distracted by his features; strong jaw, framed by sharp cheekbones. A glare that terrors the stars, but still beckons him. Kim Dokja\u2019s breath hitches. Did Yoo Joonghyuk press harder against his throat? He must have, with the way he\u2019s looking at him, his eyes more intense than usual.\u00a0\nHe must be angry, Kim Dokja thinks. Angrier than normal. Eyes dark like a starless night. An indescribable gaze. He doesn\u2019t know what that certain flavor of anger signifies, what that  look  means, ranging between minor annoyance and near-death.\u00a0\nIf he had to make an educated, unbiased guess, then he thinks Yoo Joonghyuk probably wants to beat him up. Like every other time, with Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s hand brushing against his own as they walk through the scenarios.\u00a0\nItching to rest his hand against his blade, instead. (Itching to hold his hand, instead).\u300cKim Dok ja thinks : You kn ow what that loo k means. \u300d\n\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk says. Why is his voice deeper then usual? \u201cWhat else?\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2013\u201d Kim Dokja bites his lip, worries it between his teeth. He\u2019d rather not speak more of this. He handles pain better than the truth.\nYoo Joonghyuk lowers his gaze, stares at the tongue disappearing and reappearing from his lips. He\u2019s entranced for a full minute, before snapping his gaze back to Kim Dokja. Who tries to shrink back into himself. And who doesn\u2019t answer. His tongue makes a reappearance instead, wetting his lips obscenely.\u00a0\nAlmost involuntarily, Yoo Joonghyuk tightens his hands around Kim Dokja\u2019s throat, making him whimper. Fuck, he really doesn\u2019t want to tell him. But Kim Dokja will\u2026 he\u2019ll end up getting an erection at this rate. And that can\u2019t happen.\u201cS-Stop choking me,\u201d Kim Dokja whines. His heart has found its way in his throat, threatening to pour out of his mouth. His dick jerks in the confines of his pants.\u201cSpeak.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s voice sings to him, pulls the beat of his heart higher in his throat. Louder.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s an insurmountable, impossible task to stop gulping in this situation. Which of course, means that Kim Dokja has failed. He\u2019s not the protagonist.\nHe gulps. And the movement makes the fingers on his throat burn like a brand against his neck. His dick gives another twitch. His pants are too\u2013 they\u2019re too tight. Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s eyes have never looked fiercer. Looking directly at him.\nHe\u2019s not just a simple reader anymore.\n[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 is shaking!]\nKim Dokja closes his eyes. Breathe. Focus. This is nothing personal.\n[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 solidifies.]\n\u201cHave you ever heard of the Erotes?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nWhy did Kim Dokja bother to ask? He already knows all there is to Yoo Joonghyuk.\n\u201cThey're a group of winged gods, commonly associated with love or desire. Followers of Aphrodite.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk clicks his tongue. \u201cOlympus.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Olympus had a hand in this. They\u2026 These particular gods are known for playing pranks like these. Even to the dismay of Olympus. And\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\nKim Dokja tries to look away. But it\u2019s quite hard to accomplish this when the strongest incarnation in existence has his hands wrapped around your neck. And when he gives another hard squeeze\u2013 Kim Dokja has never been any harder. He knows his dick is probably leaking by now.\n\u201cAh-hah,\u201d he whimpers. Kim Dokja desperately tries to blink the tears out of his eyes. Pain or pleasure, he can\u2019t tell. Not like it matters, when it\u2019s Yoo Joonghyuk.\u201cStop,\u201d he says. His voice is barely audible, low and needy.\nYoo Joonghyuk smirks. \u201cThe more I choke you, the more honest you become.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.that\u2019s not true,\u201d Kim Dokja says, weakly.\u00a0\n[The character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has used the \u2018Lie Detection\u2019 skill.]\n[Your statement has been confirmed to be false.]\nYoo Joonghyuk\u2019s lip twitches, while Kim Dokja\u2019s face drops. He\u2019s never felt so humiliated.He thrusts Kim Dokja against the bed, without letting go of his throat. And Kim Dokja willingly lets himself be guided, lets Yoo Joonghyuk press him to the bed. He still keeps his hands around Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s wrists. Then Yoo Joonghyuk presses his knee against Kim Dokja\u2019s dick, and the world grinds to a halt.\u201cUh,  ah.\u201d he whimpers. \u201cNo.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk shifts his weight from his foot to his knee, and presses down  hard.  A high-pitched moan escapes from Kim Dokja. It hurts, but it feels good, and it\u2019s not enough. He wants to come so bad.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you want me to stop,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk whispers. \u201cThen keep talking.\u201d\nWhy does it sound like Yoo Joonghyuk wants the opposite? Like he\u2019s actually willing to fuck him?[Your understanding of the character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has increased.]\nYoo Joonghyuk\u2019s pupils are blown wide.\n[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 is shaking dangerously!]\nHe needs to stop thinking.\n\u201cThese minor gods\u2026\u201d Kim Dokja exhales, shakily. \u201cThey usually target couples, or couples-to-be. Or they instigate orgies and the like.\u201d\n\u201cThose  scenarios? I thought it was nonsense. People who weren\u2019t honest with themselves.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s how they never get caught. One of their more famous gods is Eros, commonly known as Cupid. Which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve at least heard of.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk makes a noise of understanding. He stares intently at Kim Dokja. Waiting.\nWaiting for what?Kim Dokja licks his lips. \u201cAnd the reason why it\u2019s particularly difficult to stop their scenarios is because their probability feeds on desire and affection\u2026 Even if\u2013 if the scenario was requested from Himeros, the god of unrequited love\u2026\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk stills, and Kim Dokja feels sorry. He didn\u2019t want Yoo Joonghyuk to know about him like this.He continues. \u201cEven then, Himeros is simultaneously the god of sexual desire. In any case, at least one of the targets has either feelings of love or sexual desire towards the other.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk asks, suddenly. \u201cAre you.\u201d\nKim Dokja turns his head, tries to bury it in these stupid, expensive sheets, but Yoo Joonghyuk grips his throat harder, brings his face level to his own. If Kim Dokja stuck out his tongue, he could touch his lips. Yoo Joonghyuk blinks, slowly, and Kim Dokja can  feel his eyelashes; those irritating, thick strands of hair. Can feel the heat of his gaze on his skin.\n[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 becomes thinner.]\n\u201cThe\u2013the only other alternative to clear this scenario is to get rid of the source of desire or love. It\u2019s impossible in most cases, which is why these scenarios are so successful. Or you can kill the target to remove the source permanently. Or...you remove what binds them in the first place.\u201d\nKim Dokja shuts his mouth. Then opens it immediately. He can\u2019t stand this teasing anymore.\u201cYou can...cut it off. I\u2019ll become an eunuch. And this will clear the scenario, since it can no longer be accomplished\u2026\u201d\nKim Dokja looks at Yoo Joonghyuk furtively. Then shuts his eyes.\n\u201cPlease make it quick. My skill should block off most of the pain, and I can probably regenerate it back with the materials from the Dokkaebi bag.\u201d\n\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d\n\u201cJust, hurry it up.\u201d\n\u201cKim Dokja. Everything you\u2019ve told me until now... Is it true ?\u201d\u201cI believe so?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk\u2019s fingers tap against his throat, and Kim Dokja jerks. Fuck, why is he still hard in this kind of situation? Just the prospect of having Yoo Joonghyuk touching his dick in any matter makes him hard,  fuck. Even if it\u2019s with a sword.\u201cKim Dokja. Yes or no.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he exhales. Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s breath is warm against his lips. \u201cYes, what I\u2019ve told you about this scenario is true.\u201d\n[The character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has used the \u2018Lie Detection\u2019 skill.]\n[Your statement has been confirmed to be the truth.]\nIt\u2019s quiet, yet the air is tense. Electrifying. An impending, inevitable doom.\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk\u2019s smile is blinding.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get started, then.\u201d There\u2019s a hint of happiness in Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s voice, rare in appearance, stranger still than a fickle god returning your prayers. Kim Dokja is momentarily mesmerized.\nHe only ever notices it few far and between the months(decades) they\u2019ve spent together: his lip upturned for half a second when he talks to his sister; when he cooks for his team; when he tortures Kim Dokja under the guise of medical aid, brushing his scarred hands against his injured skin\u2014and gone like a whisper in the wind. Fuck, since when was the protagonist so excited to cut off his dick? Kim Dokja thought his desires were pretty well concealed.\n\u201cJust get it over with.\u201d Kim Dokja grits out, embarrassed. He has his eyes closed, but he wants to cover them with his hands. But Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s wrists feel more reassuring, somehow. So he squeezes his eyes tightly. Squeezes Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s wrists. And hopes he can\u2019t see the disgust on his face.He waits. And then. And then\u2013\nInsistent, warm lips press against his. Kim Dokja makes a startled noise in his throat, lips parting. A strong, thick tongue invades into him, licks into his mouth. Yoo Joonghyuk releases his hand from his throat, and cups his cheek. Tilts his head in a way that invites his tongue deeper inside him.\u00a0\nKim Dokja is shaking. He makes cute little gasps every time Yoo Joonghyuk slides in his tongue. Anything he does overwhelms him\u2014 he\u2019s read thousands over thousands of Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s lives, but nothing compares to the raw sensation of  Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s lips against his skin. Nothing compares to feeling him form a smile against his mouth, groaning out his name in a revering manner.\n\u300cKim Dok ja thinks: this is bet ter than my dreams\u300d\nKim Dokja makes a loud, broken noise, before tearing his mouth away. He pants, his heart running a mile an hour. He\u2019s never, ever been kissed. Never dared to dream how warm his lips could be. Yoo Joonghyuk seems unaffected, except for how red his mouth is, and the satisfied smile resting on his face. The lights reflected in his eyes look like stars.\nYoo Joonghyuk looks  happy.\nKim Dokja can\u2019t\u2012he can\u2019t afford to think about what that means.\u00a0\n[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 becomes dangerously thin.]\n\u201cWhat\u2013\u201d He gasps, shuddering. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u300cKim Dok ja is a fo ol \u300d\n\u201cDid you become stupid after three years?\u201d There\u2019s fondness in his voice. \u201cI\u2019m kissing you.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk brings his mouth back to Kim Dokja\u2019s, but he covers Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s lips with his palm. Even this much skin contact is dizzying for him; his nerves are laser-focused on their point of contact. He hopes Yoo Joonghyuk can\u2019t see, can\u2019t feel how bad his hand is shaking.\nHe should know better by now.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you\u2012don\u2019t you want to clear the scenario?\u201d\u00a0\nHe tries to sound resolute.\u00a0\n\u300cBut Kim Dok ja sounds hope ful\u300d\n\u201cYes?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk tilts his head, exposing his tanned throat. Amusement trickles in his voice. Kim Dokja doesn\u2019t look at the muscles stretching to his neck.\u00a0\n\u201cForeplay is important, Kim Dokja. Even if you\u2019re a virgin, you should know this.\u201d\nKim Dokja\u2019s face burns. \u201cThat\u2019s not it! Just\u2014cut off my dick! I can regenerate it, it\u2019s fine! I won\u2019t die!\u201d\n\u201cThat won\u2019t clear the scenario.\u201d\n\u201cAre you deaf? Did you not hear me the past few minutes?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t regenerate my dick.\u201d\nHuh?\n\u300cYou will al ways be a fo ol \u300d\nYoo Joonghyuk silently watches Kim Dokja, how his eyes waver. His smart mouth pinched together in confusion, the worried crease between his eyebrows. His clever brain trying to process the information Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s given. Always trying to find the upper hand. The way out.\nBut Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s waited a long time for this, and he won\u2019t let him escape that easily.He licks Kim Dokja\u2019s palm, who immediately retracts his hand. Cups the back of Kim Dokja\u2019s head, kisses his lips. Tries to lick them apart. Kim Dokja whimpers, but doesn\u2019t open his mouth. Stubborn like always. Yet Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk releases his other hand from his throat and cups Kim Dokja\u2019s crotch. Strokes his thumb against the zipper. He hears a sharp inhale, and chuckles, softly. Lets his fingers rest there for a few seconds, then squeezes it tightly.\u201cAh.\u201d Kim Dokja moans against his lips, prideful little mouth open. Yoo Joonghyuk slides his tongue back where it belongs. His mouth is ever so sweet and alluring.\nYoo Joonghyuk fiddles with the zipper on Kim Dokja\u2019s pants, then pulls out his dick. He whimpers at the sudden exposure of air, and a bead of precome drips down his palm. If Yoo Joonghyuk found the touch of another male disconcerting, any doubts Kim Dokja had are squashed by the confidence of his actions.\nHis hand wraps around the shaft easily, and the sudden contact immediately robs Kim Dokja of his concentration. Yoo Joonghyuk gives his dick a quick tug, which makes Kim Dokja stiffen and cling to the hard muscles of his back. He rubs him slowly. His whimpers are swallowed by Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s lips. Their kisses get sloppier; excess saliva trickles down the corner of his mouth.It\u2019s a difficult decision, but Yoo Joonghyuk decides he\u2019d rather hear him instead. He retracts his mouth and Kim Dokja stays there, limp and panting. Mistakes his actions for respite.\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk looks down. It\u2019s pretty, he thinks. Paler than his own, obviously smaller but it\u2019s...it\u2019s cute. A cute little curve, a perfect size. He runs his thumb across the slit, and presses down. Strokes him faster than before. Kim Dokja gives out a startled cry, and little  uh-uh-uh\u2019s, his hand clutching desperately at his bicep.\u00a0\n\u201cYoo Joongyuk-ah,\u201d Kim Dokja blinks furiously. \u201cI-ah-ahh\u2012\u201d\n\u201cCome.\u201d\u00a0\nKim Dokja moans in Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s ear as he comes, his spine rigid. It\u2019s the sweetest sound he\u2019s ever heard. Ears ringing, his eyes slide shut.\nIn the haze of Kim Dokja\u2019s post-orgasmic bliss, he hears Yoo Joonghyuk say: \u201cWe\u2019re not done here.\u201d\n[0 out of 5 \u25fc\u25fc COMPLETED]\nKim Dokja struggles to open his eyes. His mouth feels stuffed with cotton.\n\u201cYoo Joonghyuk, there\u2019s no need\u2014\u201d He stops.\nYoo Joonghyuk is licking the come off his fingers.  His  come. He watches the obscene curve of his throat move as he swallows it down. Kim Dokja draws in a sharp breath when he realizes Yoo Joonghyuk is staring at him. His heart beats fiercely.\n\u201cBitter,\u201d he says. His lips glisten with spit.\n\u201cYou sunfish, why...\u201d Kim Dokja doesn\u2019t think his face can get any redder.\n\u201cI\u2019m cleaning my hand.\u201d\n\u201cThen, a napkin-\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\u201cYoo Joonghyuk, just-\u201d Kim Dokja startles at the sudden constriction of Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s hand around his neck. Again. It won\u2019t be long before he\u2019s hard again, heat pooling low in his crotch. Yoo Joonghyuk looks at him thoughtfully, a glint in his eyes.\n\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d\nKim Dokja complies, parting his lips, before his mind catches up to his body,  oh no\u2014 Yoo Joonghyuk thrusts his come-slicked fingers down his throat. He moans as the taste of his release fills his mouth.\n\u300cKim Dok ja would have preferred Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s sem en\u300d\nIf only he could refute...\n\u201cIf you\u2019re so keen to clean my hand, do it yourself.\u201d He sounds smug, which he has every right to be, with Kim Dokja whining desperately around his fingers like a whore. He humps against his thigh, relishing the heady sensation of his fingers in his mouth.\nHe\u2019s almost sad when Yoo Joonghyuk removes his fingers from his mouth, a thread of saliva snapping away. He stands up from the bed. Kim Dokja reluctantly rises up in a sitting position.\nAnd then Yoo Joonghyuk starts to strip, and Kim Dokja\u2019s brain surges back to alertness.\u00a0\n\u201cWait. Stop.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He drops his trenchcoat to the ground.\n\u201cYoo Joonghyuk!\u201d\nHe lifts his arms above his head and slides off his black turtleneck shirt,  sexily, somehow. He slicks back the curls from his face, and looks at him. Kim Dokja stares at the steady rise and fall of Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s muscled chest. Scars linger all over his torso, crisscrossing his abs.\nHe\u2019s.. He\u2019s so\u2026\nYoo Joonghyuk\u2019s curled hand pauses at his flat stomach, fingers dipping in the hem of his pants. He lifts his chin and smirks. It\u2019s an infuriatingly good look on him.\n\u201cEnjoying yourself? Kim Dokja.\u201d\nHe makes eye contact with him. The retort dies on his tongue. Kim Dokja is suddenly very, very aware that they\u2019re only two people in the room.\n[Clear Conditions: Penetrative \u25fc\u25fc with incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk. Minimum of 5 \u25fc\u25fc.]\nTrapped in his heated stare, Yoo Joonghyuk slowly zips down his pants. The fabric bunches up on the ground, and he steps out of them. The muscle in his thighs flex involuntarily. Kim Dokja trails his eyes down to the thatch of dark hair. He\u2019s large and excessively  hung, his cock slightly curving to the right; red and hard and twitching, dripping. Kim Dokja wants to catch the salty drops on his tongue. Stupidly huge protagonist cock.\nKim Dokja\u2019s hole throbs, painfully (good).\n\u300cKim Dok ja thinks: I am a who re\u300d\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d\nHis dick twitches, and he squeezes his thighs together.\n\u201cDid you think you had a choice?\u201d\nBelatedly, Kim Dokja realizes he never answered back to Yoo Joonghyuk. He feels him gently grasp the back of his neck, forcing him to lift his head.\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk is dangerously beautiful.\n\u201cDid you think I would let you run away?\u201d\n\u300cKim Dok ja wishes he could run away\u300d\nHe caresses the short strands of his hair, in a gentle, almost-patronizing manner.\n\u201cDid you think you could escape from me?\u201d He says, haughtily.\n\u300cBut Kim Dok ja knows that once you\u2019ve attracted Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s attention, escape is futile from the leash of a regressor\u300d\n\u201cBut\u2026 Lee Seolhwa?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a weak deflection, but Kim Dokja is desperate to tether himself to some form of reality. Yoo Joonghyuk drags him up in a standing position. He strips off his coat, throws it to the ground.\n\u201cDon\u2019t care.\u201d\nKim Dokja is about to object, but a warm hand firmly squeezes his ass. Yoo Joonghyuk grinds their bare cocks together, the slick friction welcome. Their hips are flushed against each other. He gasps, keeps his fists clenched at the sides of his waist.\n\u201cShe\u2019s your ex-wife, Yoo Joonghyuk.\u201d\n\u201cIrrelevant.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk rips off the buttons from his collar, drops his shirt to the ground. He feels his nipples tighten upon exposure to air; shivers when Yoo Joonghyuk runs a hot palm along his spine. He rests his hand on the curve of his back.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not homo\u2014\u201d\n\u201cQuit stalling.\u201d\nThe last shuffle of clothing. Kim Dokja\u2019s pants pool around his ankles. Yoo Joonghyuk nudges his knee between his thighs, fondles the meat of his ass. Pulls him slowly to the bed, trapping him in his muscled arms, until he\u2019s laying in his lap, legs around Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s waist. His breath is hot against Kim Dokja\u2019s mouth; they kiss, open-mouthed, cocks brushing.\nThere\u2019s nothing more separating them. No clothes. No more social niceties. Just the warm expanse of Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s skin, bare for him to see. Only him.\nNo longer a protagonist and a reader.\n[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 becomes as thin as a pane of glass.]\nLube is included within the subspace.

Ba-bump.\nYoo Joonghyuk bends his finger inside him, and he gasps, clenching around him. He buries his head in the crook of Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s shoulder. The taste and sweat of the protagonist do nothing to calm the inhale of his traitorous lungs, how he greedily gulps another breath of tainted air.\n\u201cRelax, Kim Dokja.\u201d\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk pushes in a second finger. His hole throbs around the intrusion, eager for more.\n\u201c\u2014Uhh  .\u201d Kim Dokja squeezes his arms around Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s torso, digs his fingers in the muscles of his back. He rocks his hips. It feels, it  feels \u2026\nHe keens, sudden, as the fingers inside him scissor wide and brush his prostate.\n\u201cFound it.\u201d He gives out a throaty chuckle.\nHe drags the pads of his fingers against his sweet spot,  presses  and Kim Dokja jerks in his hold, his dick leaking against his stomach. The fourth wall is no longer there to stop him from crying out. This is his reality, now.\n\u201cHow lewd.\u201d\n\u201cAh, get it out.\u201d He\u2019s on the verge of going insane.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk squeezes his grip on his waist, and taps a third finger against the rim of his hole. Kim Dokja shakes his head.\n\u201cOut.\u201d His bottom lip juts out. Yoo Joonghyuk pinches his rim, smiles when he whines, grinding down on his fingers.\n\u201cCan\u2019t. Your greedy cunt won\u2019t let go.\u201d\nStupid fucking pornstar protagonist and his stupid sex god skills.\nYoo Joonghyuk thrusts in the third finger, and his hole accommodates; the stretch makes him ache for more. As if to demonstrate what he said.\nHis teeth bite at his earlobe. \u201cSee, Kim Dokja?\u201d He twists his fingers and grinds them upwards, and Kim Dokja\u2019s vision whites out for a second. He gasps, his dick painfully hard.\n\u201cGreedy. Are you really a virgin?\u201d\n\u201cL-let me come.\u201d Sweat trickles down his face.\nYoo Joonghyuk kisses him, thrusts his tongue down his throat. Swallows his needy moans every time he teases his sweet spot.\nBy the time he has four fingers inside him, Kim Dokja is shaking like an addict.\n\u201cYoo  Joonghyuk. Plea\u2014Please. \u201d\nKim Dokja sobs when the fingers are abruptly removed from him. His hole clenches on empty air. He\u2019s manhandled, laid down on the bed.\n\u201cDokja,\u201d says Yoo Joonghyuk. He rubs the fat head of his cock against Kim Dokja\u2019s hole, greedy and open for him. But Yoo Joonghyuk doesn\u2019t push it in. Just keeps rubbing his cock between his thighs. Fuck, there\u2019s no way it\u2019ll fit.\nBut Kim Dokja  wants, he wants this cock to split him open, wants to feel it in his throat,wants .\n\u201cYoo Joonghyuk,\u201d Kim Dokja begs. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2012you don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d\nAnd because Kim Dokja is an honest, upright man, he wraps his legs around Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s waist.

He wants his tongue, the warm lips on his skin, his arrogant smile, his...\nKim Dokja wants Yoo Joonghyuk.\nThe next time Yoo Joonghyuk thrusts, Kim Dokja times it so his cock aims at his hole. The cockhead pushes through, and Kim Dokja sobs. Feels it pop in him. Feels Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s precome spill copiously inside him.\nInside.\nIn him. It\u2019s in him.  Inside. Not enough, not deep enough. He needs it deeper, please, deeper.\nBut Yoo Joonghyuk pulls out, and Kim Dokja gasps out, brokenly. Frustrated.

But really, is there any more shame left in him? His hole flutters excitedly, dick leaking over his abdomen. The conclusion of this story has already been determined, but human shame is not something that can be so easily forgotten. Even when he has discarded his humanity.Kim Dokja knows how this story ends. But he has never been willing to play by the narrative.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he begs. \u201cPlease, Joonghyuk.\u201d\n\u201cKim  Dokja.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk snarls. God, he\u2019s so beautiful when he\u2019s angry, handsome eyes tight with restraint. \u201cPlease, let me fuck you.\u201d\nKim Dokja bites his lips, lowers his eyelashes. Hooks his arms around the back of his legs, lifts them up. Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s breath dies in his lungs. Because he can see Kim Dokja\u2019s pink hole perfectly, clenching and unclenching. Can see his pretty little cock crying for attention, curved over his flat stomach. Knows Kim Dokja is greedy for him.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Says Kim Dokja in a low, sultry voice. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0\n[The character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has used the \u2018Lie Detection\u2019 skill.]\n[Your statement has been confirmed to be false.]\nWho said he had any shame left? Kim Dokja certainly didn\u2019t say anything like that.\nAnd Yoo Joonghyuk is so very, very close to losing his reason here.\n\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d He grabs Kim Dokja\u2019s arms, pins them next to his head with one arm. Spreads his legs wide with his thighs, grasps his cock and aligns it right in front of Kim Dokja\u2019s hole. Pushes his cock in just the tiniest bit, and stops. Feels Kim Dokja squirming, trying to swallow him inside.\u201cPlease,\u201d Kim Dokja cries. Tears slip down his cheeks. He\u2019s never craved this badly for anything. He\u2019s never felt the hunger pangs in his bones, the need spreading in his veins. Like all he wants to taste is Yoo Joonghyuk. He\u2019s shaking with something he doesn\u2019t want to name. Doesn\u2019t yet have a name.\n\u201cDokja,\u201d he groans. He brings his lips to Kim Dokja\u2019s throat. Exhales against his pulse.\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait anymore.\u201d\nHis cock pushes against the entrance, catching on his rim, then pulls back. Pushes again. \u201cDokja.\u201d\nKim Dokja can feel it throbbing. \u201cDokja, please.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk caresses his inner thigh, then pushes a finger in. Two. Three. His hole accepts it easily, now.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want something bigger?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk murmurs. Kim Dokja bites the inside of his cheek.\n\u201cDokja.\u201d His voice is low. Magnetizing.\u00a0\nHe presses his cock against the entrance, and his hole flutters. Begging.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you everything you need,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk whispers. \u201cAnything you want. I\u2019ll take care of you in life and death.\u201d\n\u201cPlease.\u201d He brings his lips to Kim Dokja in an almost-kiss. Venerating. \u201cWill you let me have you?\u201d\nKim Dokja is a weak, weak man. And he\u2019s no protagonist.\u201cYes,\u201d He whimpers, softly.\n[The character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has used the \u2018Lie Detection\u2019 skill.]\n[Your statement has been confirmed to be the truth.]\nYoo Joonghyuk kisses him then, heart thrumming in his chest. He pushes his cock in. Slowly, at first. But they\u2019re both almost-insane at the pleasure, of the heat they\u2019re finally able to feel. His hole throbs, impossibly trying to accommodate his girth.\n\u201cHa,  too big, haah,\u201d Kim Dokja whines, tears swelling. The stretch is making him delirious. It\u2019s insane how good it feels like, and he doesn\u2019t want to let Yoo Joonghyuk know. There\u2019s another half to go. The protagonist doesn\u2019t need another ego boost, thank you very much.\n\u201cDokja, fuck.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk is shaking, gasping. He grits his teeth. Kim Dokja is so very tight around him. Fever-hot.\nThen Yoo Joonghyuk snaps his hips, shoves the rest of his cock in him, and Kim Dokja cries,  loud. \n\u201cJoonghyuk\u2012ahh, uhh ,\u201d He shudders.\u00a0\n\n It\u2019s in, it\u2019s in, it\u2019s all in, it\u2019s Yoo Joonghyuk, oh my god\u2014\u00a0 \n\nHis breaths are coming in quick bursts. \u201cHah, b\u2012bastard, do you think can just  shove\u2012\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk pulls out his cock, then shoves it back in. Does it again, and again, again, not stopping, even after Kim Dokja pleads for mercy.\u00a0\n\u201cOh! Slower\u2014ah!\u201d Kim Dokja moans uncontrollably. He nails his prostate on every thrust, and it won\u2019t be long before he\u2019ll come.\nYoo Joonghyuk is aware it\u2019s Kim Dokja\u2019s first time, and that he should\u2019ve gone for restraint; but Kim Dokja has this way of messing around with his control unlike no other, even to his own dilemma. But he\u2019s red-faced and rolling his hips eagerly, panting and sobbing for his dick, more desperate than a whore\u2014and that suits Yoo Joonghyuk just fine.\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d Tears stain his pretty cheeks. Yoo Joonghyuk wraps a hand around his neglected cock, and jerks it once.\nWhimpering, Kim Dokja\u2019s eyes roll to the back of his head as he comes. He clenches around him, insides spasming; his flat stomach bulges from his cock. His hair is plastered to his damp forehead. His chest rises rapidly, nipples flush with sweat.\nThe sight is too much for him. Yoo Joonghyuk comes then, back muscles flexing, spine rigid.

Maybe beyond the confines of an ending.\nAn epilogue of sorts, perhaps.\n\u00a0\n[TIME REMAINING: 00:00:00]\n[All participants will now forcibly be expelled from the current scenario.]\n[Thank you for your time. We hope to see you again.]\nKim Dokja blushes. Yoo Joonghyuk doesn\u2019t say anything, but he links their hands together.\n\u00a0\n[You have been transferred to Seoul, Korea.]\n[The \u2039Star Stream\u203a has noticed your presence.]\nThey find themselves in the outskirts of the Industrial Complex. Right outside the protective barrier charms. Yoo Joonghyuk looks at the nearby crumbling building with impassive calm, and begins his walk to the company base.\n\u00a0\n[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 appreciates incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s comradeship.]\n[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 has sponsored 1,000 coins.]\n[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 wonders what happened.]\n[The constellation \u2018Great Sage Equal to Heaven\u2019 shows concern for your injuries.]\n[The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 says you should have released your seal.]\n[Many constellations are inquiring about your well-being.]\n[The constellation \u2018Queen of the Darkest Spring\u2019 is looking at the constellation \u2018Demon King of Salvation\u2019.]\n[The constellation \u2018Queen of the Darkest Spring\u2019 is smiling.]\n[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is looking at the constellation \u2018Queen of the Darkest Spring\u2019.]\n[The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 is looking at the constellation \u2018Queen of the Darkest Spring\u2019.]\n[The constellation \u2018Queen of the Darkest Spring\u2019 is telling the constellations to be patient.]\n\u00a0\nCitizens of the Industrial Complex are often in fear or awe of their overlords, and Yoo Joonghyuk pays them no mind as they stare shamelessly.\n\u201cMust\u2019ve been a strong fight.\u201d\n\u201cThe Supreme King looks uninjured... but looking at our lord, it must\u2019ve been quite serious.\u201d\n\u201cSo many teeth marks\u2026 Was it a vampire? I\u2019ve heard rumors of their strength.\u201d\nMurmurs of acknowledgement and wonder.\n\u201cHow brave...\u201d\n\u00a0\n[The constellation \u2018God of Wine and Ecstasy\u2019 has entered channel #BI-90594.]\n[The constellation \u2018God of Wine and Ecstasy\u2019 has spilled his drink.]\n[The constellation \u2018God of Wine and Ecstasy\u2019 is laughing.]\n[Many constellations are asking for an explanation.]\n\u00a0\nKim Dokja glares, and elbows Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s ribs. He gets himself hurt instead.\n\u201cIf you want to say something,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk grins. \u201cSay it out loud.\u201d The end of his mouth twitches.\n[The constellation Demon King of Salvation is telling incarnation \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 to walk faster.]\nYoo Joonghyuk hums. \u201cHaven\u2019t I worked hard enough for the past scenario?\u201d\nKim Dokja turns red.\nAlong the way, Bihyung pops into existence with a  crack. He looks at Kim Dokja in a complicated manner. His furry eyebrows are scrunched up in a worm-like pattern.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to distribute the rewards for the previous scenario.\u201d\nBihyung waits.\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk says. Kim Dokja doesn\u2019t answer, and doesn\u2019t make eye contact with the dokkaebi.\u00a0\nBihyung stares at Kim Dokja, his eyes twitching. Kim Dokja glares. He continues.\n\u201cYou will receive 10,000 coins and a C-grade flavor pack with a random effect status.\u201d\u00a0\nBihyung pauses. \u201cAnd as a bonus for going above the requirements of the previous scenario\u2012\u201d\nKim Dokja\u2019s eyes widen.\u00a0\n\u201cYou will receive 2x C-grade succubi elixir, 10x XXXL Deluxe Limited Edition\u2012\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBihyung, shut  up,\u201d Kim Dokja rasps, voice rough. His throat hurts. \u201cJust send me the rewards later.\u201d\n\u00a0\n[Many constellations doubt their ears.]\n[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is looking excitedly at the constellation \u2018Demon King of Salvation\u2019.]\n[The constellation \u2018Demon King of Salvation\u2019 is glaring at the constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019.]\n[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 says she is looking respectfully.]\n[Many constellations are wondering about the contents of the hidden scenario.]\n\u00a0\nThey keep walking. Reach the main plaza, with flowers blooming from the cracked asphalt.\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk kicks open the door to the company base. The employees of Kim Dokja\u2019s company, relaxing in the lounge, stare at their dramatic entrance in a moment of stupor. Han Sooyoung apathetically keeps drinking her energy drink.\nYoo Joonghyuk stares back, and walks past the lounge, to the second floor. He\u2019s stopped by Jung Heewon throwing her sword in front of him, the weapon digging in the concrete wall. The glint of her blade reflects Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s displeased face.\n[The constellation \u2018Demon King of Salvation\u2019 says to not damage company property.]\nHan Sooyoung rolls her eyes.\n\u201cHey, bastard. You can\u2019t just drop by like that without an explanation.\u201d says Jung Heewon.\n\u201cIs Ahjussi injured?\u201d says Shin Yoosung. \u201cWhy are you carrying him?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s tired.\u201d says Yoo Joonghyuk. \u201cLee Seolhwa can check up on him later.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk tries to walk upstairs, but is stopped by Lee Hyunsung\u2019s burly frame. His arms are spread out, palms out in a deceiving showcase of peace.\u00a0\n\u201cWe need to make sure Dokja-ssi is not injured.\u201d He says, tone firm. \u201cYou know how he is.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk huffs. \u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cWhere!  Where  is Ahjussi injured!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMaster, you know we can\u2019t trust his words\u2012\u201d\nIt\u2019s touching, really. Kim Dokja knows he\u2019s loved. But he\u2019s also experiencing the most humiliating moment of his life. And Han Sooyoung is too quiet, and knowing her, she\u2019ll\u2012\nShe pokes at Kim Dokja\u2019s neck, who flinches. She whistles, low.\n\u201cSo you guys fucked? Wow. All this stress for nothing.\u201d Han Sooyoung says, before popping a strawberry lollipop back in her mouth.\nIt\u2019s silent for a split-second, before devolving into absolute nonsense.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way\u2012\u201d\n\u201cAhjussi is too ugly\u2012\u201d\n\u201cAhjussi isn\u2019t ugly!\u201d\n\u201cOut of all times, you had to choose now\u2012\u201d\n\u201cUgly, not on Master\u2019s level\u2012\u201d\n\u201cCalm down, I\u2019m sure Dokja-ssi wouldn\u2019t\u2012\u201d\n\u201cStop saying Ahjussi is ugly!\u201d\n\u201cWe can just ask Master, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll say\u2012\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201c\u2012No, huh?\u201d\nThey stare. Yoo Joonghyuk stares back, unfazed. Han Sooyoung cackles, and cracks open a can of beer. She doesn\u2019t really need to get drunk now, but it\u2019s best practice for avoiding incoming headaches.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re life and death companions. Which means he\u2019s mine.\u201d\n[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 is shaking!]\nKim Dokja covers his face with his hands. He wishes he could faint, drop to the ground and play dead, but Yoo Joonghyuk has him in a princess carry, grip firm. Strong enough to never let go.\n\u00a0\n[The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 has dropped his stick.]\n[The constellation \u2018Great Sage Equal to Heaven\u2019 tears out his hair in shock.]\n[The constellation \u2018Maritime War God\u2019 welcomes the new warship.]\n[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is crying happily.]\n[The constellation \u2018Father of Rich Night\u2019 doubts the capabilities of the incarnation \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019.]\n[The constellation \u2018Queen of the Darkest Spring\u2019 wants to host the wedding.]\n[The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 asks who released the seal on their third leg.]\n[300,000 coins have been sponsored.]\n\u00a0\n\u201cBiyoo.\u201d Kim Dokja\u2019s voice cracks. Tears are prickling at his eyes from embarrassment.\u00a0\u00a0\n[The constellation Demon-like Judge of Fire says she has a healing elixir for sore throats\u2012]\nA fluffy snowball lands on Kim Dokja\u2019s head. She nuzzles his nose.\n\u201cBa-aht?\u201d\n\u201cClose the channel.\u201d"
