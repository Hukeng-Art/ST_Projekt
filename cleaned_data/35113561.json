    "text": "\u201cMate.\u201d\nRon\u2019s voice was hoarse and exhausted. Harry knew how he felt.\nHe reached out through the bars, and Ron\u2019s hand clasped his fervently. Harry closed his eyes and listened to the erratic jumping of Ron\u2019s heart, or at least what he thought was his best friend\u2019s heartbeat. If it wasn\u2019t, Harry didn\u2019t think he wanted to be told.\n\u201cThey\u2019re throwing you through the Veil tomorrow.\u201d\nHarry nodded slowly. He supposed that was kinder than the other possible option, which was to be Kissed by a Dementor. He felt a faint flicker of hope or gratitude or something like that. It was so small that he really couldn\u2019t identify it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how they can believe it,\u201d Ron said next, his voice as disjointed as Harry\u2019s thoughts had become over the last few days.\nHarry shrugged. \u201cThe word about the Horcruxes got out, and some people thought I was Dark because I was tainted by Voldemort,\u201d he mumbled, shifting around. There was nowhere in the holding cell that was really comfortable. He had a toilet and sink and nothing else. Dark Lords didn\u2019t need things to sit or sleep on, apparently. \u201cAnd some people thought that me not using the Killing Curse or anything like that on Voldemort was a sign that I was so powerful I didn\u2019t need to, and that made them more afraid.\u201d\n\u201cI hate them.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t show you hate them,\u201d Harry said, although he knew it might be too late for that. Ron and Hermione had protested his coming execution to the point that the Ministry would be afraid of them, too. \u201cJust\u2014try the best you can to go on and live your lives after this. Can you promise me that, Ron?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d His best mate\u2019s hand tightened crushingly on his, and Ron leaned forwards to smash his face against the bars. His glare was wild. \u201cHow can you tell us to do that, Harry? How can you think that this isn\u2019t going to destroy us?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s inevitable that I\u2019m going to die, now,\u201d Harry whispered. He\u2019d made up these words last night when he was lying on the floor and staring at the stone ceiling and the darkness all around him. This holding cell was in a distant part of the Ministry, and they only ever turned on the lights when someone visited. \u201cI want you and Hermione to make sure you can live. And\u2014and think about it, Ron. If they did this to me, then they might do it to someone else. They didn\u2019t give Sirius a trial, either. I want you and Hermione to make sure that you\u2019re safe, too. Don\u2019t give the Ministry an excuse to go after you.\u201d\nRon sighed a little. \u201cHermione is already planning to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again.\u201d\n\u201cBut she\u2019s planning to do the research quietly, right? And keeping her mouth shut for a little while so that when she starts reforming the laws, she has the power to do it and people who think she\u2019ll go along to get along?\u201d\n\u201cDid you discuss it with her?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I just thought about what the best way would be to guarantee that she could pass the laws she wanted, and that was what came to mind.\u201d\nRon laughed, or half-laughed. \u201cShe said the same thing to me this morning. She said they\u2019ll pay, but she\u2019ll take it slow and make them think about it.\u201d\nHarry nodded. He wouldn\u2019t have said even that much aloud, but a lash of his magic when he\u2019d woken up the first morning and found himself here had destroyed the listening and eavesdropping charms the Ministry had placed. They\u2019d tried to renew them when they brought him his meals, but Harry had deliberately kept destroying them. The Ministry shouldn\u2019t know Ron and Hermione\u2019s plans.\nHe was going to die, but his friends could live.\n\nIt\u2019s almost the same thing I thought as the last time I died.\n\n*\n\u201cNo pictures.\u201d\nKingsley\u2019s voice was loud and strained. Harry kept staring straight ahead as they marched him through the public portion of the Ministry towards the lifts. People along the way, from Ministry employees to witches and wizards who had \u201cbusiness\u201d there that day, stared and shouted and hurled curses at him. Luckily, the Aurors who marched three deep around Harry had to lift shields to protect themselves, which meant none of the spells hit Harry.\nHe wouldn\u2019t be able to duck away from them now, the way he was anchored with chains around his wrists and arms and legs and ankles and neck. If he\u2019d had a broom, he could have shown them\u2026\n\nI\u2019m never going to fly again.\n\nAfter everything, that was what almost broke him, that thought on the march to the Veil. Harry blinked rapidly and kept staring straight ahead. He heard one camera click, and a second later Kingsley incanted a loud Summoning Charm. There was an outraged squawk.\n\u201cNo pictures, I said,\u201d Kingsley snapped, and then moved in front of Harry so that all Harry could see was his broad back in the fine blue Minister\u2019s robes.\nYou couldn\u2019t spare me, Harry thought. I wonder how hard you tried. He hadn\u2019t seen Kingsley except from a distance on the day when he\u2019d been thrown into the holding cell. He didn\u2019t know how much the man had been involved in Ron and Hermione\u2019s protests, if he\u2019d listened to them but not been able to do anything, or if he\u2019d decided that he couldn\u2019t risk the Minister\u2019s office on trying to help.\nBut he was here now, and blocking Harry from having pictures taken of him. That was\u2014not the same as sparing Harry\u2019s life, but it was doing something he didn\u2019t have to.\nHarry kept watching the swaying of the Aurors\u2019 robes, not the walls of the lift as they rode down to the Department of Mysteries, and not the way the walls spun and danced as his captors negotiated their way to the Death Chamber. He did hear someone whining about how \u201cWe should have left Potter to the Unspeakables,\u201d and was very glad that he managed to hide his shudder as they walked up to their destination.\nBeing thrown through the Veil was a load of bollocks, as were the reasons they\u2019d condemned him as a Dark Lord, but being left to the tender un-mercy of the Department of Mysteries would have been worse.\nThere were some of them watching, in grey robes, as Harry was marched up to the Veil. Probably taking notes, knowing them.\n\u201cHarry Potter, you are to be flung through the Veil of Death for numerous crimes, including but not limited to\u2026\u201d\nHarry tuned it out. He stared at the Veil, listened to the whispering voice (even now they said nothing that he could really make out), and wondered if Sirius was on the other side. If he would see him. If he would see his parents, or if he would find himself in King\u2019s Cross again and have to take the train to go on.\nHe supposed it didn\u2019t really matter. He would be dead no matter what, gone no matter what.\nI hope everyone I leave behind has happy lives, he thought absently as the Aurors cast spells that dragged him, despite his chained ankles, towards the Veil.\nHe was numb long before they pushed him through.\n*\nHarry tears himself out of bed and crashes to the floor, panting hard. He lies there for long moments, aware that the only cloth wrapped around his head is from his sheets, and that the quickly drying sweat on his body comes from nothing more than his nightmare. After long moments, he sighs and straightens.\nA glance at the small clock by his bed reveals that it\u2019s five in the morning. Good enough to be going on with, Harry supposes. He won\u2019t get back to sleep after dreaming of his past like that, and he has to open the shop at six-thirty.\nHarry stands up and reaches for his wand, which still gives a small unhappy thrum when he touches it. Harry ignores that. He worked for hours to find a wand in the small Knockturn Alley wandmaker\u2019s shop that was the only place he dared to go after he found himself on the other side of the Veil, somehow alive and without his chains. This one, chestnut wood and dragon heartstring, was the best.\nAnd if it still feels like it doesn\u2019t belong in his hand, well, he doesn\u2019t really belong in this world, either. So they resemble each other.\nHarry fills his rusty bathtub with water, and casts a Warming Charm on it to heat it. Then he strips efficiently and sinks into the water. It\u2019s nothing like the warm showers he once dreamed of taking when he was on the run after the Horcruxes, but so what?\nNothing has worked out according to his dreams.\nHarry washes efficiently, behind his ears and everywhere else, and then stands up and Vanishes the dirty water. Hugo Jenkins, his boss, isn\u2019t fastidious, but he does insist on a certain level of cleanliness from his staff. And that Harry has never once missed work or shown up dirty makes Jenkins look on him with a kind eye.\nHarry needs to keep his job at this world\u2019s equivalent of Borgin and Burke\u2019s. Merlin knows he has no chance of getting one anywhere else, with his lack of OWLS and NEWTS, and it\u2019s not as though he has a vault of gold waiting here to cushion him if he falls.\nBut he\u2019s been here five years, and if he has no friends and no allies, well, that\u2019s the way it has to be. He\u2019s seen what happens when people start deciding that he\u2019s worth paying attention to. The last thing he wants is to end up being forced through the Veil here. He\u2019d probably end up back in his original world, and this time they\u2019d have him Kissed.\nOr he\u2019d end up in some world that, unlike this one, did have a Voldemort.\nHarry stretches, eats a piece of toast with jam for breakfast, does his best with his impossible hair, and goes to work.\n*\nDespite the amount of rubbish in it, Jewel in the Unexpected, Jenkins\u2019s shop and Harry\u2019s place of employment, isn\u2019t as Dark as Borgin and Burke\u2019s was. They mostly specialize in selling slightly illegal items, the kind that Aurors can\u2019t be bothered to chase down, like grimoires bound in human skin. The Aurors are more interested in finding people who are binding those grimoires now then scolding people for buying or selling ones that were bound centuries ago.\nHugo Jenkins grunts as he comes through the door. Harry\u2019s already had it open for a half-hour, and is busy rearranging books on the shelf.\n\u201cHere as always, Harry?\u201d\nHarry nods respectfully to his boss. Jenkins is an old, fat wizard, with a comfortable belly and just a fringe of white hair around the sides of his head. He wears mauve robes every day; they may be the same ones that he just hits with a Cleaning Charm, for all Harry knows. Jenkins isn\u2019t that shrewd except when it comes to bargains, and he isn\u2019t unprejudiced, full of casual hatred for Muggleborns like so many wizards Harry has talked to here.\nBut even though Harry is, as far as Jenkins knows, Muggleborn, he lets him work here. And he doesn\u2019t ask questions. Those are all Harry needs to make him loyal.\n\u201cSeen the Oracle today?\u201d\nHarry shakes his head as he puts on dragonhide gloves to slide a cursed crystal ball into a drawer. The Oracle is the equivalent of the Prophet here, and although they\u2019re better on reporting pure facts about minor things, they carry salacious gossip about Wizengamot members and singers and Quidditch players on a regular basis. Harry doesn\u2019t give them his business.\n\u201cInteresting article about Mr. Riddle.\u201d\nHarry half-winces at the sound of the name, but doesn\u2019t say anything. Tom Riddle is a powerful wizard here, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, but there\u2019s no sign that he\u2019s committed more crimes than just trying to get rid of his political opponents. Harry doesn\u2019t seek out news about him, and tries not to show any interest if someone tells it to him.\n\u201cSays here,\u201d says Jenkins, settling back in his chair as he unrolls the paper, \u201cthat he\u2019s in a coma. A special curse. They don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll recover.\u201d\nHarry makes a vague noise as he slides the gloves off. Then the bell over the door tinkles as a woman comes in with a furtive air and a veil wrapped around her face, and Harry forgets about Riddle as he settles into serving people who can barely look at him and will have no reason to concentrate on a mere shop assistant if they do.\nJust the way he likes it.\n*\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me! I have no idea how to take this curse off him, either.\u201d\nTom strains against the feeling that\u2019s gripped him, as if he\u2019s wrapped in a thick dark cocoon from head to foot. It restrains his magic, his body, his ability to open his eyes or speak. If he could just try hard enough, perhaps he would be able to see them and tell them that he can hear them. He knows exactly what this is. He knows exactly where it came from.\n\u201cI might.\u201d\nTom tenses at the sound of that voice, the voice of the person who cursed him in the first place, but he hears clothes rustle as if other people are turning towards her. \u201cWhat do you mean, Travers?\u201d\n\u201cThis is the Sleepless Soul Curse. We need to find someone whose magic and soul are compatible with his, someone who can pull him back to the land of the living because they\u2019ll remind his own soul and magic that it exists. And there\u2019s a seeking spell that might find someone who\u2019s like that for Mr. Riddle.\u201d\nTom is actually grateful for the curse that means he can\u2019t frown right now, because he has no idea what Travers is doing. Why curse him and then try to save him? She could keep him lingering in a coma for weeks or months before someone else sought to research the symptoms and stumbled on the solution.\nAh. This probably didn\u2019t work out the way she wanted. She most likely wanted Tom\u2019s death outright, not this uncertain half-living situation, and when the curse didn\u2019t work immediately, she decided to make herself a heroine so no one will investigate her too closely, as one of the two people who was with Tom when the curse felled him.\nTom doubts that she knows he can hear things, any more than anyone else does, as there\u2019s a noisy chorus of approval. Then Travers says, \u201cAnd we have to be prepared to bring anyone here. A goblin, or a Veela, or a Mudblood. And I say that we get ready to give them whatever they want in return.\u201d\nThere\u2019s some discontented muttering at that, and Tom would certainly object if he could open his eyes. He isn\u2019t going to have a goblin mucking about in his magic.\n\nNot even if it\u2019s the only way for you to ever wake up again?\n\nTom would grimace at that thought if he could. Yes, all right, he would put up with a lot to have the ability to move around again, and speak, and get out of this bed, and have vengeance on Travers.\n\u201cThen let\u2019s go. We\u2019ll need to perform the spell in another room, or it might just point to Mr. Riddle as the closest compatible candidate in magic and soul.\u201d\nTom strains to listen as they step out of his hospital room, but he can\u2019t hear any more now. His fingers are motionless in the heavy sheets. He wishes they weren\u2019t. He wishes he could pluck and move and curse.\nHe tries to imagine what it will be like to have someone else touch his soul, no matter how briefly, but he can\u2019t, so he focuses on imagining revenge on Travers instead. It\u2019s much more pleasant.\n*\nHarry frowns down at the dented iron collar he\u2019s holding. It has a place in the front, where two delicate spokes run together, that might once have held a jewel, but there\u2019s no stone there now. He then frowns at Jenkins.\n\u201cIt\u2019s magical,\u201d Jenkins says, and ends up with an enormous yawn. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not cursed. We\u2019ll sell it.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Harry says, even if he can\u2019t see what use the collar will be without the stone that was probably the focus of its magic. He hangs it up on a hook that will allow it to display to as much advantage as possible and examines the next artifact in the pile that one of their regular customers brought in to hide from a Ministry raid.\nAt one time, Harry felt very odd about that, knowing that he\u2019s working in the kind of place that keeps artifacts like the diary hidden from the Aurors rather than for the kind of organization that finds those artifacts. But it doesn\u2019t matter. He knows no one here, except Jenkins and a few people who come into the shop often. He\u2019s not on any side. He just accepts the artifacts, and a special fee for holding on to them for a time.\nThe ones that have owners who can\u2019t afford the fee or owners who don\u2019t want to pay it go on display.\nThe next artifact is even odder, what looks like a twisted half-curve of gold somehow melted and reforged so that it forms one continuous piece. Harry doesn\u2019t know how you would wear it, or what you would use it for in a ritual.\nHe\u2019s just turning to Jenkins to ask if he should hang it from the ceiling on one of their finer silver chains when his head jerks to face the front door. Jenkins narrows his eyes. \u201cWhat do you sense?\u201d\nHarry has no idea why he\u2019s so sensitive to the approach of magic in this world, something he never felt in his own. But coming through the Veil probably gave him all sorts of odd gifts and sensitivities, he thinks. All that matters is that magic projects in front of its owners, and behind them, and around them, like a kind of stiff, invisible cloak, and alerts Harry, telling him something about those owners\u2019 power level and mood.\nThis mood is urgent, angry, despairing in one person. And the magic that\u2019s honed to a defensive edge means\u2014\n\u201cAurors,\u201d Harry snaps.\nJenkins flicks his wand once. The complicated illusion spell speeds over the shop, snapping into place like wings around the illegal artifacts. The books will now have harmless spines and titles. The cursed suit of armor will look like a fine set of robes. The iron collar gleams like it\u2019s made of silver.\nAll harmless, all incapable of attracting attention. Harry himself calls down his magic into the depth of his belly and holds it there. It helps that he has a wand so ill-suited to him, because it makes him look less powerful. Jenkins thinks that his odd ability to feel magic is the only special talent he has.\nHarry will take that, as he\u2019ll take his calm, peaceful, normal life in every other way. The Parseltongue and the Patronus Charm and the ability to overcome the Imperius Curse and whatever damage he might carry from having once been a Horcrux can stay his own secrets, thank you.\nJenkins leans back and folds his hands on his ample belly as if going to sleep. Harry picks up a rag and begins to wipe dust off the counters just as the door crashes open.\nOne of the Aurors, a tall woman with black hair, is marching along behind her extended wand, which blazes at the tip. It points straight at Harry. He blinks and stares at her, trying to show as much fear as she\u2019d expect to find in a half-legal Knockturn Alley shop assistant, and not a whit more.\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d she demands of him, moving the wand around a little as if she expects it to point at Jenkins. But it comes back to pointing straight at Harry, as steady as an anchor. Harry has a bad feeling about this.\n\u201cHarry,\u201d Harry squeaks, staring at the Aurors behind her. They\u2019ve spread out in a defensive half-circle and are staring at him, too. Harry tries to ignore the way that his heart bounds just at seeing them.\nThis isn\u2019t your world, he reminds himself sharply. You\u2019ve done nothing to attract attention. You aren\u2019t the Boy-Who-Lived.\n\u201cYou may have heard that Mr. Riddle has been cursed,\u201d the woman says, and Harry barely fights the temptation to bury his head in his hands and howl.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry says cautiously.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a curse called the Sleepless Soul. It induces either death or a coma unless a search can find someone else with a compatible soul and magical power to free the cursed person.\u201d The woman leans forwards a little. \u201cI cast the spell to find the person in Britain most compatible with Mr. Riddle in magic and soul. It led me straight to you.\u201d\n\u201cBut there might be someone else more compatible?\u201d Harry asks hopefully. \u201cOutside Britain?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the time, kid,\u201d says another woman behind the first one, whose smile Harry might find comforting if she wasn\u2019t clad in the scarlet robes of an Auror. \u201cPlease come with us now. I promise you, if this works, Mr. Riddle is going to reward you with whatever you want. Your days of working in this poky little shop are over.\u201d\nThat\u2019s exactly what Harry\u2019s afraid of. He doesn\u2019t want to come to the Ministry\u2019s attention, much less Riddle\u2019s. All he can think of is that sooner or later, it\u2019ll mean a trip to Azkaban or the Veil.\n\u201cCan I just have my anonymity?\u201d he whispers. It doesn\u2019t take much work to act overwhelmed, not when he actually is. \u201cI want to come back to my shop and my job. Please don\u2019t tell Mr. Riddle who I am.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long pause among the Aurors, as they look at each other. The woman who\u2019s pointing her wand at him looks happy, however. \u201cSomeone modest,\u201d she says, and smiles. \u201cYes, certainly. But you know that he may get your name from your soul, when it connects with his.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a soul-connection ritual?\u201d Harry asks faintly.\n\u201cSpell, but yes,\u201d says the other woman Auror. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, kid. I promise, I\u2019ll make sure myself that you can come back to the shop, and no one will tell Mr. Riddle about who you are, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d\nHarry nods quickly. He can\u2019t imagine what Riddle does for fun other than eliminate his political rivals and chase down magical Britain\u2019s criminals in increasingly terrifying ways, but he doesn\u2019t want to become Riddle\u2019s newest project.\nHe\u2019s an ordinary person who, if someone digs into his background, has no way to explain his existence to this world. He can\u2019t afford friends, let alone the kind of notice that might come his way if he appears in the papers or gets an Order of Merlin or something like that. He doesn\u2019t think the Aurors will spread the word around, though. They\u2019d probably be embarrassed themselves at fetching a Knockturn Alley shopkeep to their master\u2019s bedside.\n\u201cBe safe, Harry.\u201d\nThe words from Jenkins are so unexpected that Harry jerks his head to the side, staring. His boss is sitting up, staring at him with bright, worried eyes.\nA little warmth fills Harry\u2019s belly as he nods. He supposes he has one friend, then, or someone like it.\nHe turns back to the Aurors, in time for the one with the lighted wand to turn and march out of the shop, and the one who seems nicer to bow her head a little to him. \u201cMy name is Isabelle Yaxley. Our fearless leader in the front there is Lucinda Travers\u2026\u201d\nHarry lets the names wash over him. They won\u2019t matter, soon, although he thinks he has heard both those names in the papers as Aurors with lots of active cases and arrests. He\u2019ll go, do what he needs to do, and then return to his shop as soon as he can.\nHe could resist, he supposes, but why make waves? Why attract attention? Why leave Riddle in a coma forever if he can help?\n*\nTom is more than frustrated. He can\u2019t lift so much as a finger, can\u2019t twitch an eyelid. He thought that by the time Travers returned, he\u2019d be able to muster up some resistance against her.\nBut no. She marches into the room in company with several other people. Listening, Tom can hear Yaxley\u2019s footsteps, and wishes he could get her attention somehow. She would be on his side, he\u2019s sure.\n\u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d asks a nervous, young male voice. The person they found who\u2019s compatible with his soul and magic, Tom supposes. The whole thing makes him stir with restless disdain, or would if he could move.\n\u201cJust stand still,\u201d says Travers.\nTom listens in interest, wondering if her next ploy is going to be to assassinate the person who\u2019s compatible with him. But the spell would find more than one candidate, so it\u2019s not as though that would avail her in the end\u2014\nHe misses the quiet casting of the spell, but he doesn\u2019t miss the feeling of another soul touching his, or the music that comes with it.\nTom is utterly overwhelmed. From the time that he first drank the Elixir of Life after becoming Nicholas Flamel\u2019s apprentice, he\u2019s been alone and removed from the world. Even his familiar bond with Nagini is at a shallower level than it would be for most other wizards. That\u2019s always been all right with Tom. He doesn\u2019t particularly want to share power.\nBut this. This.\nThe music cascades through his soul, a song that he\u2019s always known, that he must have heard more than once on the waking edges of his dreams. It has a high, skirling radiance, but dips down even as Tom listens, and becomes as effortless as birdsong.\nYet it has its darker tones, too. A soul filled with absolute light would have nothing in common with his own, Tom thinks.\nEnthralled, Tom listens, and barely notices when his fingers begin to twitch and loud, excited voices cry out. What do they matter? He wants to hear this song. He wants to listen to it forever.\nImages dart through his head, but too fast to become more than swirling colors, now and then a glimpse of stone walls or a reaching hand, a smiling face, a recalcitrant wand of chestnut wood. Tom tries to seize on that last image, follow it up, but meets a dark wall that knocks him back into the flow of music.\nWhy does this man have a wand that will not serve him well? Tom will change that. He will make things better for the one whose song is bringing him out of the curse.\nTom has never felt this way. He decided against killing early on, yes, but mostly because it would attract too much attention. He has never cared much for other people. Either they are enemies or they are servants. And his enemies are too easily dispatched to engage him for long. In fact, Tom\u2019s most pressing foe in the last few years has been boredom.\nHe would never be bored again if he could go on listening to this song, he thinks. He reaches towards it, reaches\u2014\nHis eyes snap open. Tom takes a long, deep breath, and tries to sit up. He must see who this person is, the owner of that voice.\nTravers seizes his shoulders and holds him in place. \u201cAre you all right, Mr. Riddle?\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly fine.\u201d Tom manages to ignore the urge to send his magic rolling up her arms and burn her to death from the inside out, and looks around hurriedly. He\u2019s too low on the bed to see much other than Auror robes, however. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n\u201cHe who, sir? Please lie still, we were all so worried\u2014\u201d\nNot you, you murderess, Tom barely refrains from saying. She didn\u2019t manage to kill him, and he has someone he\u2019s much more interested in right now. \u201cThe man you brought here to revive me. Who is he? Where is he?\u201d\nTravers hesitates, making Yaxley step forwards. \u201cHe asked for only his anonymity as a reward for his service, sir. I had the impression that he was scared stiff to be in the Ministry even though we were the only ones who knew he was here. Please leave him alone.\u201d\nTom stares at her. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d he finally says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt him. I want to reward him.\u201d\n\u201cNevertheless, sir.\u201d\nYaxley has her stubborn face on, which means Tom will get nothing out of arguing with her. But surely other Aurors know who this is, and Travers is a weak point, is made of weak points. Tom can question one of them and figure it out.\nFor now, he does feel weak, and lies down to make it seem as if he\u2019s slipping back into a natural sleep, despite the racing speed of his heart. He clutches desperately at the fading memory of the music in his mind, but it\u2019s going. The memory is nothing like the real thing, and won\u2019t be even if Tom manages to put it in a Pensieve.\nI will find you, he thinks drowsily, as sleep catches up with him after all. Wherever you are, whatever your name is, whether you\u2019re a saint or a criminal, an Auror or an alchemist.\n\nNothing will ever hurt you again once you\u2019re mine. I swear it. \n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d The voice was slow and unfamiliar.\nHarry rolled over to stare out through the bars of the holding cell. The lights had turned on a few minutes before, so he\u2019d known he would have a visitor, but he\u2019d thought it would be Ron or Hermione, not a stranger.\nBut it wasn\u2019t a stranger who stood in front of the bars. Not exactly. It was Justin Finch-Fletchley, flinching and holding his robes closed as if he thought there was some sort of invisible slime in the air that that might coat them.\n\u201cJustin,\u201d Harry breathed as he sat up. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\nJustin flinched and looked around, and Harry wondered if someone had constrained him to come when he didn\u2019t want to. But it would have been an odd choice. Someone who would get a reaction from Harry would be someone more like Neville or Luna, if the Ministry didn\u2019t think Ron or Hermione safe to approach.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Justin finally asked.\nHarry frowned. \u201cTell you what?\u201d\n\u201cI thought\u2014well, there were all those rumors about you being the Heir of Slytherin in second year, and it turned out you weren\u2019t after all.\u201d Justin ran his hand through his hair. \u201cBut now the rumors are about you being a Dark Lord, and I think you know that you are one. I mean, you\u2019re powerful enough to be one. Whether or not you\u2019re ever going to be one in actions.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I should have told you that I was a Dark Lord? Why? I\u2019m not one!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re old friends, Harry\u2026\u201d\nJustin let that trail off when Harry laughed harshly at him. Harry turned away and lay down with his face to the wall again. \u201cI don\u2019t know who told you to come here and was convinced you would get something out of me,\u201d he muttered, closing his eyes. \u201cBut you can tell them that it didn\u2019t work and I\u2019d appreciate it if you never came back again.\u201d\nJustin said nothing for long moments, long enough that Harry could almost believe he\u2019d gone away. Then he cleared his throat and said, \u201cWe never asked for this.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s we?\u201d\n\u201cThe ordinary students. Kids at Hogwarts. We never asked to be caught up in a war between you and You-Know-Who.\u201d\nHarry didn\u2019t bother responding, and after another few blustering tries, Justin went away. Harry snorted bitterly to himself and closed his eyes.\nWhatever the Ministry wanted from him\u2014some verbal acknowledgment of his \u201ccrimes,\u201d most likely, that they could look at in Justin\u2019s memory\u2014they weren\u2019t getting it from him. Harry had just about decided that anyone who wanted something from him the way that the Ministry did could fuck off.\nBut one of Justin\u2019s sentences lingered in him, a slow-growing seed.\nWe never asked to be caught up in a war between you and You-Know-Who.\nThat was true, that was real, maybe the only true or real thing Justin had said during the attempted conversation. And it was the one thing Harry regretted. He would have given a lot to keep other people out of his conflicts with Voldemort.\n*\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re fine?\u201d\nHarry sighs a little and glances at Jenkins, who is leaning around the side of the counter as if he thinks Harry might explode if he comes closer. \u201cFine, sir.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Jenkins hesitates. \u201cIf you need time off, you just need to say so.\u201d\nHarry turns away from contemplating how to hang the curve of gold to stare at him. This is the man who barely pays Harry enough to have his flat and small meals and patched robes, and who gets upset if Harry sniffles or coughs, no matter how sick he might actually be. And now he\u2019s insinuating that it would be okay if Harry took time off?\nJenkins folds his arms. \u201cI just wanted to know if you\u2019re sick,\u201d he snaps. \u201cYou\u2019ve been acting like you were since Riddle\u2019s flunkies returned you.\u201d\nHarry lets the angry words crawl back down his throat. He doesn\u2019t see the point in getting angry at people in this world, mostly, any more than he saw the point of fighting the Aurors yesterday. He needs his job, just like he needs to be ignored by the Ministry.\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cJust\u2014surprised, by the fact that Aurors came and got me and let me go again.\u201d\n\u201cHave a reason not to want to be looked at too long by the Aurors, then?\u201d\nHarry thinks of the illusion spell that Jenkins put on his ship yesterday, and snorts. \u201cYes, sir. Along with many others.\u201d\nAs he expected, direct confrontation makes Jenkins back away with his hands in the air. \u201cNever said that I didn\u2019t, never said that I didn\u2019t,\u201d he mutters hurriedly. \u201cAnd as long as you\u2019re not sick, you can work here, and\u2014well, look, my house-elf made this.\u201d\nHarry blinks as Jenkins turns and draws the cloth away from a package that he set down on the floor by his chair earlier. Harry assumed it contained his lunch, but it turns out to be a beautiful cake with waterfalls of white chocolate and cream down the sides, crowned with plump strawberries.\nHarry licks his lips and can\u2019t stop the rumble of hunger from his stomach. \u201cThanks, sir. Can I have a piece right now?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, of course!\u201d\nJenkins waves his wand to cut the cake, making the piece larger than he probably would if he wasn\u2019t feeling so relieved. Harry doesn\u2019t object, though. When the cake settles in front of him on a round plate that he had no idea Jenkins kept behind the counter, he closes his eyes and bites into it.\nIntense sweetness fills his mouth, the kind he hasn\u2019t tasted for five years. Harry opens his mouth and nods to Jenkins, then swallows and says, \u201cThanks, sir.\u201d\nJenkins nods happily enough, cuts his own slice, and begins to eat. Harry savors his cake, filling his mouth slowly and glad that no customers come in until five minutes after he\u2019s done.\nAnd he\u2019s sure, now, that he doesn\u2019t have to worry about losing his job. Jenkins is comfortable enough to go to sleep after lunch, and he wouldn\u2019t do that if he thought Aurors were going to raid the shop any second.\nMaybe it\u2019s worth being kidnapped for a few hours sometimes, if this is the result, Harry thinks, and swallows again to remind himself of the taste of white chocolate and strawberries before he goes back to work.\n*\nTom hisses to himself as the seeking spell he cast, the same one that Travers used a few days ago to find the man with music in his soul, once again fizzles out. It\u2019s working. But it manifests to Tom as a faint version of the song he heard, not the guiding light that lit Travers\u2019s wand, and it doesn\u2019t seem to get louder as Tom madly Apparates around the country, chasing the sound.\nThus, whenever the spell ends, Tom is no better off than he was before.\n\u201cPermission to enter, sir?\u201d\nTom glances up and nods at Isabelle Yaxley, whose smile lights her blue eyes as she steps towards the edge of his desk. \u201cYou said that you had a special mission for me, sir.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Tom forcibly yanks his attention away from the last teasing notes of the song, and tries to look like he\u2019s slept well since the last time he heard it in reality. \u201cI wish you to keep an eye on our dear Lucinda.\u201d\nYaxley blinks, and her forehead furrows. \u201cYou think there\u2019s something wrong with her, sir?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s say that I have reason to suspect something, yes.\u201d Tom closes his hand on his wand, and doesn\u2019t tilt his head in the direction of the last music as it once again fades from his comprehension. \u201cShe may have been taking bribes. Or she might be the victim of someone\u2019s Imperius Curse. Either way, I think she\u2019s been acting out of character, and I want to be reassured whether it was her fault or someone else\u2019s before I yank her out of her position.\u201d\nYaxley looks more and more puzzled, but she nods. \u201cVery well, sir. I\u2019ll bring you a report tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Tom says. He is a little irritated at having to put his vengeance against Travers off, but his cursory investigation has revealed nothing of her motive for trying to kill him, and he doesn\u2019t have the attention to give it right now. He\u2019s cleared his paperwork and meetings for the afternoon, so he can investigate that taunting song. \u201cI trust in you, Yaxley.\u201d He stands up.\n\u201cWill you need an escort, sir?\u201d\n\u201cNo, thank you, Yaxley.\u201d\nTom moves out of the office, aware of the way that her concerned gaze rests on his back. If there\u2019s one of his Aurors who has his own good at heart, or at least the good of the country that would be destabilized by suddenly losing a powerful Head for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, it\u2019s Yaxley.\nAt the same time, it means she has an irritating sense of ethics, and she won\u2019t tell him anything more about the man the Aurors brought to the Ministry several days ago.\nTom takes the nearest Floo to his home, and spends the next half-hour researching a spell in a tome that he hasn\u2019t taken down from the shelves in ages. Magic to enhance his senses intrigued him at one point, but his interest faded. Now that he thinks about it, most of his interest in everything except ways to attain more power seems to have disappeared in the last decade.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s the reason the song intrigues me so much, in comparison to the blandness of everything else. Maybe once I discover this man, then I won\u2019t find him that interesting, and I\u2019ll let him go after an interrogation.\n\nBut preparations for immortality, which included a lot of meditation courtesy of Nicholas, mean that Tom has a hard time lying to himself. He wants this man. He wants to speak with him, find out what he knows, probe the recesses of his soul and discover reasons behind things like the dark tones and why he\u2019s using a wand that isn\u2019t suited for him.\nSo Tom studies, practices, and then casts the spell on his ears that will allow him to hear subtle differences in the quality of the song. If it\u2019s to be soft unless he\u2019s very near his target, well, he can\u2019t do much about that. But if he can perceive a variation in the sound at all, then he\u2019ll continue to Apparate in the direction it comes loudest from, and eventually, he will hold his prize in his arms.\nAt least the strength of the song, despite how soft it is, the next time he casts the spell reassures Tom that the man hasn\u2019t died since the Aurors brought him to wake Tom.\n\nYou cannot die. I will show you.\n\n*\nHarry frowns and shakes his head, spending a moment to rub at his ear. Since the Aurors took him to Riddle, his magic sensitivity seems to have gone into overdrive. At least three times now, he\u2019s turned towards the door of the shop, anticipating the arrival of customers who never showed up.\nIt\u2019s a distant, irritating buzzing at the moment, which Harry hopes means that he won\u2019t have to react to the magic of whoever\u2019s coming until they actually get close. Jenkins hasn\u2019t said anything about it, but Harry knows that part of the reason the man\u2019s kept him on is so that his ability that can warn them of Aurors. Harry dreads what will happen if he doesn\u2019t have that anymore and thus isn\u2019t as useful.\n\u201cAll right there, Harry?\u201d\nAnd great, Jenkins has noticed. Harry smiles a little over his shoulder as he goes back to polishing the cursed silver tea set one of their regulars brought them, which can\u2019t be polished by magic without the cups trying to eat your hands. They grumble and shift even under Harry\u2019s rag. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d There\u2019s a creak in the chair as Jenkins settles back and reaches for the book he\u2019s been reading lately. Harry was a little amused to learn that Rita Skeeter became a novelist in this world, writing about imaginary Lords and Ladies engaging in romance and political scandal, instead of a newspaper reporter.\nHe supposes it\u2019s for the best, though. The Oracle is bad enough as it is, without the addition of anything she might decide to write.\nFor long minutes, the only sounds are turning pages and Harry\u2019s rag laboriously restoring the shine to the tea set. Harry steps back to survey his handiwork and shakes his head. There are still several hours\u2019 worth of labor to go, which means he won\u2019t finish this particular task today.\nThen again, what does that matter? All Harry has on his mind this evening is a small dinner\u2014they\u2019re always small\u2014of noodles and soup and a hot date with his bed. He still isn\u2019t used to the feeling that he doesn\u2019t have endless duties and tasks to save the world, and that he can put something off until the next day without a professor breathing down his neck.\n\u201cHarry?\u201d\nHarry blinks and turns away from the contemplation of his reflection in the side of the largest teapot. Jenkins is on his feet, book tucked away, reaching for his cloak.\n\u201cI\u2019m closing up the shop. You coming?\u201d\nHarry nods and secures the cursed tea set in the cabinet that Jenkins keeps such items in until the Dark magic can be removed. He doesn\u2019t have a cloak himself, but that\u2019s all right, even with the nights turning sharply towards December; he can manage a Warming Charm well enough, reluctant wand or not.\nThey\u2019re near the door when Harry freezes. This time, he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a false alarm. The magic chatters and buzzes harshly at him, and although Harry has only heard it once before, while in the midst of Tom Riddle\u2019s soul, he recognizes the sound. It\u2019s close, and it\u2019s coming fast, and it pierces Harry\u2019s heart with how loud and determined it is.\n\u201cNot Aurors this time?\u201d Jenkins asks, watching him closely.\nHarry falls back a step, shaking his head hard to clear it. \u201cNo. Sir, I\u2014sorry. I think an enemy is coming,\u201d he gasps.\n\u201cAn enemy?\u201d Jenkins\u2019s wand jumps into his hand.\n\u201cNot of yours. Of mine.\u201d It\u2019s hard for Harry to talk. The magic sings even in his teeth. \u201cPlease, sir, I\u2019ve felt this magic before. From someone in the Ministry. Go, and save yourself. I\u2019ll take the back way out and hopefully lead them away from the shop.\u201d Even though I don\u2019t think he gives a shit about what\u2019s in the shop.\nLuckily, friendship or not, Jenkins doesn\u2019t linger to question Harry, more concerned with saving his own skin. He nods and bolts out the front door. Harry locks it and touches his wand to the sign to make it melt from OPEN to CLOSED.\nThen he takes a step back, and prepares to fight for his life.\n*\nTom pauses for a moment, under his Disillusionment Charm, to watch the old wizard run past him, but then shakes his head as the loud song keeps sounding from the building in front of him, instead of changing to follow the shopkeep. He glides towards the door, pleased to see the CLOSED sign, and feeling, now that he\u2019s close enough, the storm of gathering magic.\nHe knew that the one who called to his soul could not be a weak wizard, but it is nice to be proven right, even so.\nTom raises his hand and knocks lightly on the door, testing whether this man will open to him that way. Nothing happens. Tom steps to the side and sees an alley stretching away behind the building to join up with one of the many small, crooked streets that spread off to the sides of Knockturn.\nOh, that won\u2019t do, Tom thinks. Not when we\u2019re about to finally meet.\nHe weaves a series of Parseltongue wards over the mouth of the alley, bright magenta threads that cannot be destroyed. Then he turns and uses magic to open the door gently, not causing it to fly back on its hinges. The man in the shop\u2014a customer?\u2014might value it, and Tom will preserve everything that his soul-called values.\nHe steps inside, giddy, his heart doing so many flips inside his chest that he feels as he did the day he got Nicholas to agree to the apprenticeship. No, he feels better than that. Grander than that.\nThere\u2019s only one person in the shop, which means that Tom\u2019s eyes go to him immediately. He\u2019s a slender young man, matching Tom\u2019s memory of his voice. Not that the memory will be anything like the real thing, Tom is sure, any more than his memory of the man\u2019s soul-music is like what he actually heard when their souls were joined.\nThe man faces Tom and tosses his unruly black hair out of his face. His brilliant green eyes smite Tom\u2019s heart.\n\u201cHello,\u201d Tom says, and he knows his voice is caressing, but it doesn\u2019t matter. He can\u2019t take his eyes from the marvel that is someone who might be his true match, his equal. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? I believe that you know already mine is Tom Riddle.\u201d\nThe man\u2019s eyes flash, and he crouches for a moment as though he\u2019ll leap into flight. But then he straightens back up, and shakes the chestnut wand into his hand. It\u2019s definitely the one Tom saw in the vision when their souls connected, the ill-suited one.\n\u201cI want no part of you,\u201d the man says, a thin layer of steel underlying his voice. \u201cI got you conscious again, and the only reward I asked for was my anonymity. Why are you violating that?\u201d\n\u201cI had to meet you.\u201d Tom doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019ll explain the gladness spreading through him, the warmth, the wonder. \u201cPlease, tell me your name. I promise, I\u2019m not here to hurt you or tell you to keep my secrets. I want to give you everything you want.\u201d\n\u201cThen go away.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot believe that someone with power and a soul that matches mine can truly desire only this.\u201d Tom ends the seeking spell. The song in his ears is going mad, and right now, beautiful as it is, it distracts Tom from its very real owner\u2019s voice. \u201cYou have a wand that doesn\u2019t work well for you. Why? Can you not afford a new one? Please allow me to replace it.\u201d\nThe man stares at him. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\n\u201cI felt it when our souls connected.\u201d Tom can hear a pleading tone enter his voice, but he doesn\u2019t care. He can no more take his eyes from the man in front of him than he could sever his bond with Nagini. \u201cPlease. Let me help you. Let me take care of you. Let me be all things to you.\u201d\nThe man shakes his head slowly this time. \u201cI don\u2019t know where your impression of me came from,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t have that much magical power. Otherwise, I\u2019d be able to find a wand that worked better for me. This was the best of a bad lot.\u201d\nTom laughs aloud, rejoicing in the resistance in the way that he never has in a confrontation with an enemy. \u201cI felt your magic gathering when I was still several meters away down the street. Don\u2019t lie to me, please. It insults your intelligence and mine.\u201d He can\u2019t stop smiling.\nThe man\u2019s eyes widen for a second. Tom studies his patched robes while he apparently decides on his next move, and half-nods. Yes, they speak of poverty along with the ill-suited wand. Tom doesn\u2019t know why the man hasn\u2019t used his obvious power to get more of what he wants, but perhaps he doesn\u2019t have the training. Another thing for Tom to take care of.\n\u201cI want no part of you.\u201d\n\u201cAt least tell me why.\u201d Tom can be patient. He\u2019ll hear the man\u2019s arguments. Once he knows what they are, he can counter them.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to live in the spotlight. And someone who\u2019s the friend of a politically prominent person does.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be prominent at all,\u201d Tom says instantly. In fact, the mere thought of sharing this man with everyone around him is hateful, makes him want to reach out and claw their eyes from their heads so they can never look at Tom\u2019s prize. \u201cSome of the other Department Heads maintain stringent privacy around their personal lives, and the press doesn\u2019t succeed in piercing it. I don\u2019t even know the names of all their spouses.\u201d\n\u201cSpouses?\u201d\nThe man sounds so aghast that Tom\u2019s smile widens. But he has to thank him, too. Until this very moment, when clarity struck him like the spotlight this man abhors, Tom didn\u2019t know for sure what relationship he wanted with the one who called to his soul. He has simply imagined this man as his, without specific terms other than that.\nBut now Tom knows. He will be this man\u2019s lover. Perhaps in the privacy of bed, their souls will join as they otherwise cannot without the spell.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Tom breathes. \u201cI have never found someone who could be my true equal. Now I have.\u201d\nThe man passes his hand in front of his eyes, muttering in something so low Tom isn\u2019t sure it\u2019s English. He listens devotedly. He will learn another language if he needs to, if this man is more comfortable speaking in it.\nThen the hand drops, and the man leans forwards and says, \u201cYou\u2019re mental, Riddle. No means no.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot sleep, since the coma.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI wake up listening for the sounds of the song your soul sang when it touched mine.\u201d Tom comes a step nearer. The man appears too startled to retreat. \u201cI can only hold the seeking spell for a short time when I\u2019m asleep, and the song is too faint without you near to comfort me in any case. I was fine when I didn\u2019t know there was someone so compatible with me in the world, but now that there is, I\u2019d like to court you. Sleep beside you. Be your friend, if that is all you will permit.\u201d Tom feels desperation welling up inside him, and wishes he could force it down, but perhaps it\u2019s better if he shows it honestly, just as the man is being honest with him. \u201cKnow your name.\u201d\nThe man stands there, seeming to think, for a long moment. Tom waits. He\u2019s glad, now, that he said nothing about replacing the man\u2019s robes or giving him Galleons. He doesn\u2019t think money would tempt this man.\nThe prospect of companionship? That does.\nBut in the end, the man shakes his head and says, \u201cIt would start with this soul-song, maybe, but it would end up with me being crushed under the weight of your magic and reputation. No.\u201d\nTom snaps his head up, eyes fastened on the green ones across from him. They shine with determination and will, but not with Occlumency. He dives beneath their surface easily enough, seeking the man\u2019s name and the reason that he doesn\u2019t want to be with Tom, the real reason. He was tempted for a moment. Tom needs him to be so again.\nHe grabs hold of the name easily enough, Harry, but there\u2019s a yawning black void where the last name should be. And Tom is distracted by other images anyway, ones from Harry\u2019s past that are dancing in front of him like tattered autumn leaves.\nHarry being shunned by students in Hogwarts robes who duck and shiver and move away from him.\nHarry huddled in a small dark space that doesn\u2019t seem to be a true room, holding his stomach as it aches with hunger.\nHarry being marched along in chains through the Ministry, surrounded by Aurors.\nTom\u2019s immediate and instant rage breaks through the concentration he needs to maintain the Legilimency, and Harry backs away, eyes wide. Tom paces towards him, not caring about his retreat now, consumed with the need to punish.\n\u201cWho were they?\u201d Tom demands in a voice whose low pitch complements the high, ringing sound of every glass thing in the place breaking. Tom flings up a shield to keep the flying shards from coming near Harry, not releasing him from his gaze. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize them. Who were they? How dare they hurt you? They brought you in chains to meet me?\u201d\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the other day,\u201d Harry immediately snaps, and a fire enters his green eyes that enchants Tom, that makes him want to have and hold and take. \u201cIt was another place, another time. Don\u2019t attack your Aurors on my account.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Tom agrees. \u201cIf you will come with me and explain all about it. Let me treat you to dinner, Harry. Please.\u201d He\u2019s not just asking because he wants to. He needs to do something to take care of Harry to soothe his fury, which is coiled up in the middle of his chest and sullenly blazing.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nTom loses his head, and casts the Summoning Charm with a force that he hasn\u2019t used in years, when he cast it to Summon a broom so he could escape a pit his enemies had thrown him into. This time, his magic bounds at Harry and grabs hold of him, yanking him straight towards Tom.\nHarry\u2019s eyes widen, and he retaliates with the last spell that Tom would have thought of. \u201cExpecto Patronum!\u201d\nAn enormous silvery stag leaps out of Harry\u2019s wand, no sign of weakness there now, its hooves actually ringing on the floor of the shop as it charges Tom with lowered antlers. Tom has to raise a shield, and he remains still in any case when he sees Harry slipping out the back door of the shop. His Parseltongue wards are there, and they\u2019ll keep Harry in place.\nIn the meantime, Tom is more inclined to admire rather than get upset about Harry\u2019s spell. The stag circling him and coming to a stop with a stomp of one hoof is magnificent. Tom has never seen a corporeal Patronus so beautiful or clear. And Harry managed to call it with a wand that is actively unhappy in his hand! Tom wants to see what Harry can do with a wand that is suited to him, one Tom can buy for him.\nAt last the stag fades away, and Tom strolls out into the alley, prepared to deal with a raging Harry who will be cornered against the Parseltongue wards\u2014\nOnly to find the alley empty.\nTom stares blankly at the tangled magenta threads of his wards, and realizes with a slowness that makes him feel dull and stupid what happened. Harry didn\u2019t tear through the wards, because no force would have made a dent in them. Instead, the wards are half-unraveled, lifted like an open door. Harry asked to be let through.\nIn the only way he could have. Harry is a Parselmouth.\nTom already knew he wanted Harry, knew he was obsessed. But the maw of desire that opens in him now is positively draconic, spreading wings and baring enormous teeth, as Tom\u2019s existence pivots and locks onto Harry.\n\nI want him willing. I will do whatever I have to. \n\n\nI want him. \n\nTom Apparates home, shaking with passion and greed, and ready to begin the hunt in a new way.\nIt was a day like any other day when they seized him.\nHarry had come home and hung up his rain-soaked cloak, and stood there stretching, feeling the humming pleasure of a good duel in his muscles. He was studying for his NEWTS, but undergoing training so that he could honestly enter the Aurors, too. He didn\u2019t want anyone saying that they\u2019d taken him just because he was famous.\nA series of heavy knocks fell on the door. Harry frowned and opened it quickly. It sounded so urgent that the only thing he could imagine was that it was either Ron or Hermione, and the other one was sick.\nInstead, an Auror he didn\u2019t know, with a hood surrounding their face to try and keep the raindrops off, peered in at him. \u201cHarry Potter?\u201d\nHarry nodded and started to answer, wondering if the one who was sick was Kingsley, or they\u2019d found another Horcrux or something. But then a Stunner crashed into him, and he was aware of his vision fizzling with black specks and fading.\nWhen he came to again, he was on the floor of the Ministry Atrium. Aurors were standing around him, and someone in a grey hood that might be an Unspeakable. There were voices chattering loudly back and forth, but they stopped the instant Harry stirred, groaned, and started to sit up.\nHe caught a glimpse of a familiar face in the distance, and asked, \u201cKingsley?\u201d, blurrily.\n\u201cHarry Potter, you are under arrest for violating the Ministry\u2019s restrictions on the practice of Dark Arts,\u201d said a loud voice. \u201cTo whit: not registering your true wand and power level with the Ministry, not reporting the truth to the Department of Mysteries about how you killed the Dark Lord known as You-Know-Who\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHis name was Voldemort,\u201d Harry interrupted loudly, so bewildered that he didn\u2019t take notice of the other words. \u201cWhy are you having such trouble saying it, even now?\u201d\nSomeone stomped on his wrist, making him cry out in pain, and then someone else bound him with Incarcerous and searched him, swiftly and efficiently. Whatever they expected to find, it wasn\u2019t there. Harry could have told them that they\u2019d snatched him too quickly to let him pick up his wand, but it\u2019s not like they would have cared.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not here,\u201d the searcher said.\n\u201cIt has to be.\u201d That was Kingsley\u2019s voice.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not. Unless he\u2019s Transfigured it into something else?\u201d\nThey tried to get Harry to talk, but he was already half-dazed from the Stunner and angry about the pain in his arms, and it was easy to pretend that he couldn\u2019t say anything. In the end, they dragged him into the cell and threw him on the floor, one of them wielding their wand to dissipate the ropes before they left.\nHarry scrambled up, panting and staring around in the brief moments before the lights flicked out. He saw the bare nature of the cell, the absolute lack of blankets or bed or chairs, and a cold feeling settled deep in the pit of his stomach.\nYet it wasn\u2019t all anger or fear. There was a sense of resignation about it as well, as though I should have known that would happen.\nHarry tried not to despair, but as the hours passed and no one came for him, he grew closer and closer.\n*\nHarry rolls over and gasps as he surfaces from the nightmare. Then he sighs and settles back. No wonder he dreamed of that day. He\u2019s lying on brick and stone with only a Cushioning Charm to make it comfortable, a good way to remind himself of the cell.\nAnd, well, that was the last time he lost everything. Now he\u2019s done it again. It\u2019s not as though he can go back to the shop, not now that Riddle knows he works there, and if they haven\u2019t found his room yet, it\u2019ll be a bloody miracle.\nHarry shuts his eyes and does his best to breathe through his despair and hatred and horror and anger.\nHe has no Galleons but the few he always carries on him in case he has an emergency expense. He has no clothes except what he\u2019s wearing. He has his wand, but that isn\u2019t worth much, either.\n\nYou had less than this when you arrived. You can build yourself up again.\n\nBut then, no one was looking for him. No one even knew he existed, Harry thinks, digging his fingers deep into his hair. Now they know, and they\u2019ll be looking, even if they don\u2019t get very far. He never bothered to adopt a last name when he came here, and Jenkins can\u2019t tell them what doesn\u2019t exist.\nBut Riddle, with his fucking mind-reading and his possessive greed and his determination to destroy someone who might be as powerful as himself, won\u2019t let that stop him. He\u2019ll track Harry down, probably the same way he did last night, and then what?\n\nYou know one thing you could do.\n\nHarry firms his lips and shakes his head, even though there\u2019s no one around to see him. No, he\u2019s not doing that. Even assuming he knew where it was in this world, and he doesn\u2019t think he does, not for sure. Enough history has changed that he can\u2019t expect to find it in any \u201cordinary\u201d place.\nSo. Probably the best thing he can do is get out of the country. Riddle has to give up the chase if it takes enough resources, right, or if it takes an embarrassing length of time? He won\u2019t want to seem like a little kid whinging about sweets to the country that he partially runs.\nHarry sighs, shakes his head, and steps out of the little alley off Knockturn where he spent the night.\nHe freezes when he sees Riddle standing across the street from him. Riddle is leaning against the wall of a shop and having what looks like a soft-voiced discussion with an Auror next to him. Riddle straightens the instant he sees Harry, his eyes widening with admiration and, presumably, the desire to shut Harry up in a tower somewhere.\nHarry stands there, his hands clenching, staring. Riddle turns to the Auror and says something that makes the man frown and shake his head, but the Auror doesn\u2019t follow as Riddle makes his way across the street.\nHarry thinks about running, about Apparating. He could.\nBut it\u2019s utterly obvious that Riddle can find him whenever he wants, probably by using the same spell that his people did to find Harry in the first place. And Harry can feel something else swelling and building under the despair.\nRage.\nHe never got to express that appropriately last time, what with the Ministry suddenly grabbing him, his lack of a trial, and the fact that at first he hoped being compliant and docile would encourage them to set him free. But here, who\u2019s going to care if he yells? Riddle, Harry supposes, but so what? The man has already destroyed his life. He has nothing on offer that Harry wants.\nIt would feel so good to tell someone, for once, what a dick Harry thinks they are.\nIt seems like he only blinks, and Riddle is standing in front of him. \u201cHarry,\u201d he murmurs, body angled as if he wants to keep someone out in the crowd from reading his lips. \u201cPlease allow me to escort you to breakfast.\u201d He pauses, his eyes trailing up and across Harry\u2019s face for a moment, and he frowns. \u201cDid I really cause you to sleep outside all night? That was not my intention. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nHarry stares at him, weighing the apparently sincere apology against the fact that Riddle did, indeed, cause him to sleep outside all night, and gave Harry a splitting headache with his unwanted Legilimency, and, oh yeah, destroyed his life.\n\u201cLet me tell you what you can do with your breakfast,\u201d Harry says, leaning forwards a little. \u201cAnd your escort.\u201d\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Riddle repeats instantly, his eyes locked on Harry. \u201cI only want to help you. To take care of you. And find out what happened to you in the past so that I can help you avenge yourself on the people who hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cTake out a wand and curse yourself in the head, Riddle, because you\u2019re first in line.\u201d\nRiddle doesn\u2019t explode the way Harry\u2019s been expecting. A duel would have been good, ranting and swearing better, backing off in offense best of all. But instead, he closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, shaking his head. \u201cI suppose I deserve that.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you do, you bastard,\u201d Harry says, pleasantly, with a wide smile, so that the Auror watching from across the street will think their interaction is going according to Riddle\u2019s wishes. If the Auror approaches, Harry thinks he really will have a panic attack. He only avoided one when they came to get him the other day because of Yaxley\u2019s reassuring presence. \u201cYou realize I don\u2019t have a job now, thanks to you? I don\u2019t have a home?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Riddle\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cYour boss has kicked you out? And your landlady? Why would she?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry says, and feels magic rising around him, crackling. The concerned, staring Auror, and the people around them make no difference to that, not with how badly he wants to destroy Tom Riddle. \u201cBut I can hardly go back to work or home without you finding me, can I? God, fuck you, Riddle.\u201d\n\u201cI wish you would.\u201d\nHarry stares at Riddle, interrupted before he can get his rant going, and sees the hope shining in Riddle\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s\u2014sincere, as far as Harry can tell. Riddle really does want Harry to fuck him, to come to bed with him, maybe even to kick him in the bollocks.\n\nWhat the hell.\n\nHarry shakes his head and takes a step back. \u201cYou\u2019re mad,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI mean, madder than usual. I\u2019m not\u2014a pet you can adopt, or a challenge, or the next game piece you can move on your chess board.\u201d\n\u201cI would hope not,\u201d Riddle replies softly in Parseltongue, \u201cseeing as I am neither into bestiality nor fucking objects.\u201d\nHarry groans and puts his hand over his eyes. His head is still throbbing because of Riddle\u2019s stupid Legilimency, and more than anything, he wishes he could lie down on his bed in a cool dark room and just sleep until it passes.\n\u201cHarry?\u201d\n\u201cStop saying my fucking name,\u201d Harry snaps back in Parseltongue, since he gave up on keeping that secret when he had to unravel the wards Riddle put over the alley. \u201cI have a headache because of your Legilimency, just so you know. Fuck you for reading my mind, too. You can fuck off.\u201d\n\u201cI hope I can teach you to be more creative with your curses,\u201d Riddle says, and there\u2019s a sound like a switch flicking through the air\u2014Harry jumps\u2014and then Riddle places a hand on his shoulder. \u201cThere. That took care of your headache, I hope.\u201d\nHarry is even angrier to find out it actually did.\n*\nTom studies Harry carefully, wondering what else he can offer, why Harry is glaring at him as if Tom offended him personally. Tom did not mean to drive him away from his home or job. He is not the reason that Harry spent the night in a dirty alley, on the cobblestones.\nExcept that it seems he is, somehow.\nTom takes a breath against the impulse to tell Harry that he has never offered anyone as much as he is offering Harry. For some reason, he doesn\u2019t think that Harry would be impressed.\n\u201cBreakfast?\u201d he asks, and holds up a hand when Auror Stornaway would approach him. Harry, for whatever reason, has had bad experiences with Aurors. Tom does not want to take any steps backwards in his hard-won rapport with Harry.\nHarry glares at him. Tom listens to his stomach rumble, watches his cheeks darken, and thinks that he could spend hours noting the smallest, subtlest changes in Harry\u2019s face and being enthralled with them. But he would prefer to do it when Harry is not hungry.\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Harry says in Parseltongue, and turns to walk away.\n\u201cDo you really want to spend the night sleeping in another alley?\u201d Tom calls after him, and Harry halts and turns to scowl over his shoulder. Even the view of one angry green eye sets Tom\u2019s desire flexing in him like claws tearing through his chest. He spends a moment wishing that he was not affected like that, and then remembers how bored and detached from life he felt before he was cursed and decides that he doesn\u2019t regret it.\n\u201cI can find my own place to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have many Galleons left at the moment, I suspect.\u201d Tom doesn\u2019t have to try to put sympathy or interest in his voice, the first time that has ever been true. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to drive you away from your job, but I suppose I must have.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I wonder why the owner of a business in Knockturn Alley wouldn\u2019t welcome the attention of the fucking Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.\u201d\nHarry has prowled a step or two back towards him, which Tom is careful not to point out. He is learning what will set this relationship\u2014which he is determined it will be\u2014back, now.\n\u201cCome to breakfast, then. Let me give you some money. Let me make it up to you.\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to apologize for using Legilimency on me?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t regret it. But I am sorry for the headache it caused you.\u201d\nHarry evaluates him in silence for a long moment. Tom watches him, and wishes that he could cast a spell to shield them from the sight of the people on the street, who are doing some gawking, without Harry reacting negatively. He does not want them looking. He wants to keep Harry for himself.\nThe man who can cast a Patronus Charm powerful enough to physically delay Tom. The only other Parselmouth Tom has ever met. The man so stubborn that he tried to evade the gratitude he could have claimed from Tom and slept on the streets rather than stay in a place he must have known Tom would find.\nThe man whose soul sings to his own.\nThere is no one Tom would rather have breakfast with. Or have cursing him, as it turns out.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Harry snaps, and comes walking back to him. \u201cBut if you use Legilimency on me again, I\u2019m going to hurt you so badly that you won\u2019t recover before you bleed to death.\u201d\nTom\u2019s body throbs with the longing to find out what that curse is, but he won\u2019t push. Dueling Harry can come later, after he has talked to him, extended his apologies, made up for his mistakes, and attached the first thread to make Harry his.\nAnd if Harry is only agreeing because he\u2019s hungry\u2026\nWell. It is a first step. And once Tom has taken one, he doesn\u2019t retreat.\n*\nHaving breakfast with Tom Riddle is beyond weird.\nEven if it is in exactly the kind of restaurant Harry always secretly assumed Riddle would eat in, a gleaming, posh place called the Crystal Swan with panes of glass that close all around their table and shut everyone else out. Even if the Auror, Stornaway, was dismissed by Riddle after a quiet argument Harry didn\u2019t bother to try and listen to, and that means Harry can relax a little.\nRiddle is handsome in this world, without a trace of the red eyes or other features that made Voldemort in Harry\u2019s world look horrific. He has dark hair with soft splashes of silver-grey at the temples, but his face is unlined, and his eyes are a dark and intense blue. He leans forwards across the table when they\u2019ve asked a hovering, ghost-like figure for food, and his eyes never leave Harry. They barely seem to blink.\nThat\u2019s familiar, too, Harry thinks, and folds his arms, and glares back.\nThat kind of look, which would only have sent Voldemort off, proves there\u2019s another difference between the monster Harry knew and this world\u2019s Riddle. Riddle\u2019s eyes sharpen, yes, but his grin is brilliant, hungry, and he looks for a second as if he\u2019ll reach across the table to touch Harry\u2019s elbow. Harry stiffens, and Riddle\u2019s hand drops.\n\u201cYou\u2019re mental,\u201d Harry tells him.\n\u201cBecause I wish to sleep through the night again? Because I am interested in making a friend, an ally, perhaps a lover, of the only other Parselmouth I have ever met?\u201d\nHarry feels as though someone has touched a spring in his head. There. Riddle said that one part in Parseltongue, which means that he doesn\u2019t want other people to know it, no matter how secure the wards at the Crystal Swan seem to be. Things he doesn\u2019t want other people to know are vulnerabilities. Weaknesses.\nHarry just has to make this as loud and crass and public as possible, and Riddle will go the fuck away.\nHarry\u2019s resolve falters a little when he thinks of the way Riddle stared at him in Diagon Alley with all those people walking by, but then, they didn\u2019t know who Harry was. Once Riddle begins making this public, then Harry can easily embarrass him out of attempting to pursue this\u2014this\u2014any further.\n\u201cI prefer your face when you\u2019re smiling.\u201d\nRiddle is smiling, too, gazing at him with the kind of devotion that Harry thinks other people would kill for. Well, he\u2019s received looks like that, and they all ended the same way, except for Ron and Hermione (who never really looked at him like that anyway). With \u201clove\u201d turned to hatred, and fear, and the Veil.\nHarry half-closes his eyes. He doesn\u2019t often allow himself to think of Ron and Hermione, not after five years here. He just has to hope that they\u2019re alive and making themselves nuisances to the Ministry in exactly the way Hermione was vowing to do.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a mystery, Harry.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Harry says, forcing his eyes open and seeing the obsessive way that Riddle\u2019s staring at him. Well, obsessive for right now, anyway. Harry will take care of that soon enough. \u201cIt probably drove you mad that you couldn\u2019t find out anything about my past or my surname, huh.\u201d\nRiddle\u2019s smile changes to something odd, more subtle and more crooked. Harry thinks he might be seeing the sincere side of Riddle, and shudders away from the realization internally. No, Riddle is not allowed to be sincere at him. Or, rather, he is, but that\u2019s only because he has no idea who Harry is.\n\nNot really. He just wants an illusion, the way they all do.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re good at hiding,\u201d Riddle acknowledges. \u201cAnd it really is strange. It\u2019s as if you simply appeared out of nowhere five years ago. No one knows the slightest bit about you, other than the scraps I was able to gather from your landlady and your employer.\u201d\nHarry leans forwards a little, and he knows his smile probably looks savage and deranged, but he doesn\u2019t care. \u201cIf you\u2019ve hurt them\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI have not. Although it surpasses my understanding why you are so loyal to a man who pays you starvation wages and a woman who overcharges you for the single room you\u2019re staying in.\u201d\nHarry shrugs and sits back. \u201cThey took a chance on someone who had no references and no OWL or NEWT scores and no last name to give them. Loyalty is the least I can give them in return.\u201d\n*\n\nDoes he really think so little of his own claims? \n\nTom stares at Harry and realizes that, in fact, Harry does. He looks a little uncomfortable, but as if he finds admitting to his lack of references or exam scores embarrassing. Not as if he thinks that it\u2019s embarrassing that someone capable of so much was living in the place and working at the job that he was.\nTom exhales slowly. Well, some of the mysteries are solved, then. He wondered, when he really thought about the memory of Harry being held in chains, why Harry didn\u2019t simply lash out with his magic and break them. He could have.\nHarry is truly modest and humble. That makes it all the odder that he\u2019s such a match for Tom\u2019s soul, but then again, Tom has all the pride and arrogance that he will ever need to demand what the two of them deserve. Perhaps a proud soul-called would have made the relationship between them explode.\n\u201cWill you tell me where you came from?\u201d he asks, but then the food arrives, and he can\u2019t miss the way Harry\u2019s eyes light up on seeing it. It\u2019s not just temporary, his hunger, Tom thinks. This is the look of someone who has been deprived of food for long periods of his life.\nTom wants to destroy the entire restaurant. No, better, he wants to break open the skulls of those who starved Harry, who did not teach him to think highly enough of himself to demand a full stomach, who did not pay him enough for him to afford those things.\nTom dreams of vengeance on Jenkins while Harry eats his way through a bowl of fruit, a plateful of venison, a bowl of soup, and part of a platter of chocolate biscuits. But near the end, Tom loses the pleasure of imagining Jenkins\u2019s stomach exploding for the pleasure of Harry\u2019s eyes closing and his bites slowing down as he savors the biscuits.\nTom has used food, his own magic, his words, and many other things to sway potential allies to his side before. To seduce them, if necessary, although that was a last resort simply because he feels physical passion at a reduced, flickering level compared to most people.\nNow he knows the difference. Most people were not Harry. And if simply watching Harry eat gives him this much pleasure, Tom cannot wait to see what will happen when Harry allows Tom to touch him.\nHarry\u2019s eyes flicker open, and he rears back in his chair. Tom glances over his shoulder, and then around the nest of crystal panes hemming them in. \u201cWhat is it, Harry?\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d Harry scowls and shakes crumbs off his fingers. \u201cSo sorry that I don\u2019t have the fancy pureblood manners you probably expect when you dine on your caviar and champagne every night.\u201d\nTom smiles at him. \u201cI did not grow up pureblood either, Harry.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m not a pureblood. I\u2019m a Muggleborn.\u201d\nTom blinks. The first two statements sounded true, but the last one gave him a strange twisting sensation on the edge of his mind, which he usually only senses from his Legilimency when he\u2019s actively trying to read someone\u2019s mind and they\u2019re lying to him. He decides it\u2019s probably different with Harry because Tom is so focused on him.\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Tom says slowly, delight filling him with golden fire.\nHarry glares at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a half-blood, almost certainly,\u201d Tom says. \u201cLike me.\u201d Yes, he really does feel happy, joyful, emotions he hasn\u2019t felt in so long that he\u2019s almost forgotten them.\nHarry is like him, a half-blood who didn\u2019t grow up in the magical world, a Parselmouth, someone whose magic and soul complement Tom\u2019s. What else is true of him? What else can Tom discover, find out, plumb the depths of, drag into the light?\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201cI do, darling.\u201d The endearment slips out without Tom meaning it to, but it doesn\u2019t get the reaction he expects. Harry looks at him with narrowed eyes, as if trying to see how much he means it, and then abruptly gives him a huge, friendly grin.\n\u201cOkay, then!\u201d Harry announces. \u201cYou know what, I don\u2019t think this breakfast is enough to make up for what you did to me, especially having to sleep out in the cold all night with a headache that made me feel like something was tearing through my skull. I insist on you buying me some new clothes, too.\u201d\nTom shivers. He didn\u2019t expect to win him over so easily, but he supposes that Harry is also like him in that he thinks differently of things when he sees them as revenge. \u201cYes,\u201d he agrees thickly, standing. \u201cCome, Harry. I know a robe shop that will be more than happy to cater to us.\u201d\nHarry blinks in what looks like confusion, but follows him to the edge of the crystal panes. Once they\u2019re past them, into the restaurant proper, Harry seizes Tom\u2019s hand and swings it back and forth, drawing attention from people at the other tables.\n\u201cI\u2019ll rely on your taste, Tom,\u201d Harry says softly, and gives him a huge, melting look that Tom immediately knows is fake, but which only delights him all the more. Harry wants to test him, then? To see how much he means this, and how much he can get out of Tom?\nHe will see that the answers are completely, and everything.\n*\nHarry is pleased to notice the looks of disbelief they\u2019re getting from most of the patrons in the Crystal Swan. Some people are whispering behind their hands, their eyes lingering on Harry and Riddle\u2019s joined hands and Harry\u2019s patched robes. Excellent. Harry hopes the gossip spreads far and wide, and embarrasses Riddle into dropping this as soon as possible.\nRiddle is riding the waves well, for right now, pretending not to notice the public attention, staring at Harry with that look on his face that one could call besotted. But it actually relaxes Harry now that he understands. Riddle wants him as some kind of asset, to wrap Harry around his little finger and use him. For the Ministry? To acquire more power? To perform some magic only another Parselmouth can do?\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. Because what Riddle is, above all else, is a user. And the good opinion of the public is worth more to him than Harry is any day. Because that\u2019s the way it always is. Harry only knows two people in all the worlds he\u2019s worth more than that to, and their names are Ron and Hermione, and they\u2019re\u2014not here.\nSo Harry swings their hands back and forth and chatters loudly about robes, and hears the titters follow them. Riddle\u2019s smile sharpens, and he glares at one woman who stands up as if she\u2019s going to approach them. She hastily sits down again.\nGetting to him already, Harry thinks in delight. I didn\u2019t know it would be that easy.\nHarry would skip if he could as Riddle guides him out of the Crystal Swan and almost hurries them towards a section of Diagon Alley Harry has never visited, in this world or his first one. He\u2019s already thinking of how else he can make Riddle uncomfortable enough to walk away.\nPet names? Loud, smacking, pretend kisses?\nNo, no, wait. Harry is going to escalate his demands for clothes when they reach their destination, and eventually demand the most expensive robes in the whole shop. Dudley will be his role model. That way, Harry will eventually hit a point where Riddle will refuse and walk away, but he\u2019s likely to get a couple good sets of robes out of it first. And he\u2019ll embarrass the hell out of Riddle, even better.\nHarry smiles, and sees Riddle\u2019s face soften out of the corner of his eye.\n\nGood. Let him think he\u2019s seducing me, that he\u2019s winning. He\u2019s never going to win. There\u2019s nothing real there.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want me for me, and that\u2019s the only way I\u2019d let him touch me.\n\u201cIs this to your taste?\u201d\nHarry nearly wrenches his neck turning around to look at Tom, his eyes as wide as Dumbledore\u2019s mouth when he found out Tom managed to get an apprenticeship with Nicholas Flamel. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Harry breathes. Then he abruptly folds his arms and tosses his head a little. \u201cWhich it should be.\u201d\nTom holds back a laugh. It\u2019s so obvious that Harry has never been treated as he deserves. Whoever dated him beforehand\u2014and Tom finds it hard to think about them without boiling rage rising in the center of his chest\u2014never wooed him, never took him to the places where his beauty could be properly celebrated and complemented.\nTom has to wonder why. Did they not know about his Parseltongue, his Patronus, his power? Or did they fear it?\nYes, perhaps that is it. Harry marching between Aurors would make sense if he ran into the kind of prejudiced people who once hated Tom, before he became powerful and improved Parseltongue\u2019s reputation.\n\u201cAre we getting me robes or not, Riddle?\u201d\nTom bows his head and extends his arm for Harry\u2019s. \u201cThis way, my dear.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s ears turn pink, but he still manages to accept Tom\u2019s arm and say in a voice loud enough to turn heads around them, \u201cI hope that we can find robes that are comfortable for me while still looking formal, or I don\u2019t intend to come back.\u201d\nTom smiles at him, hoping that Harry\u2019s obviously fake reactions at the moment will eventually be replaced by spontaneous, free ones. The way he gaped at the ceiling and walls of Glamoursall\u2019s fascinated Tom as much as all the rest. He wants to see more. Touch more. Have more.\n\nI will have more.\n\nOf course, if Tom tries to see it through a stranger\u2019s eyes, he can admit that Glamoursall\u2019s is well worth looking at. The inside of the enormous building is draped with midnight-blue cloth, making it resemble a tent, and the ceiling has silver stars picked out on it, as close as something can come to resembling the ceiling of Hogwarts\u2019s Great Hall without the enchantments that would let it actually mimic the night sky. Cool breezes whisper past gleaming trees whose illusions change them from spring to summer to fall to winter\u2019s bare branches on a stately, rotating basis. Winged cats swoop about the sides and walls, bringing clothes to customers on occasion and on occasion refusing to do anything but hang upside-down like giant bats.\nWhen Harry gets more accustomed to surroundings of this type, of course he won\u2019t gape. But Tom isn\u2019t able to think about that without a pang of loss.\nTo distract himself, he takes Harry straight to the dress robes section, in a corner of Glamoursall\u2019s made to look like a winter forest. Unfortunately, Harry takes one look at the dress robes and bursts out laughing.\n\u201cI thought you wanted expensive robes,\u201d Tom murmurs, trying not to show how much Harry\u2019s honest amusement does prickle him.\n\u201cYes, yes, of course I do.\u201d Harry is attempting to smother his snickers, which escape anyway. \u201cBut ones that look like something a human being would wear, not a baby from the nineteenth century.\u201d\nTom shakes his head and steers them in the direction of a spring forest that has fashionable robes of the kind someone might wear to a Ministry party where there\u2019s not going to be dancing or many of the formal old purebloods. \u201cAll right, here, then.\u201d He studies the open-front robes floating on air near them, spread out by magic so all the ripples of their sleeves and panels can be studied. \u201cI bet you\u2019d look stunning in blue.\u201d\n\u201cOh? Why?\u201d\nTom blinks at Harry. Harry has his arms folded, and seems to have forgotten the pose of \u201cspoiled child\u201d he was aiming for. He glares at Tom as hard as Tom has ever been glared at, which, considering some of the idiots he\u2019s dealt with in the Wizengamot, is frankly impressive.\n\u201cBecause it would look good with your eyes and hair.\u201d Tom keeps his voice soft and lulling as he holds up the blue robes, decorated along the sleeves and hems with golden dragons. \u201cHave you never thought about what would look good with them?\u201d\n\u201cUsually thinking too hard about people trying to kill me, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d\nTom lowers his hands as he stares at Harry. \u201cWhat?\u201d Harry can\u2019t be older than his mid-twenties. How has his life been filled with people trying to kill him?\nHarry abruptly turns bright red, and he sticks his nose up in the air again. \u201cFancy you falling for the jokes I\u2019m trying out,\u201d he says, with a voice that would be more convincing in its spite if it wasn\u2019t shaking slightly. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll try those robes, but I bet they look horrible on me.\u201d He reaches for them.\nTom holds onto the robes with one hand, putting the other on Harry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHarry, look at me.\u201d\n\u201cSo you can rip the truth out of my mind again? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\u201cPlease look at me so you\u2019ll know I\u2019m sincere in what I\u2019m about to say.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s eyes flicker back towards him. His face resembles a shut door. Tom knows it will shut all the way, and permanently, if he fucks this up.\n\u201cI wish that you had not suffered what you did,\u201d Tom tells him quietly. \u201cEven if it meant that I never would have met you, even if it means that you walk away from me now.\u201d He thinks Harry might. Everything Tom says seems to offend him in some measure or another. \u201cIf you could have had one moment of happiness more, I would wish that I had not met you.\u201d\n\nEven if I now think that I would have withered away from boredom before too much longer.\n\n*\nHarry stares at Riddle and wonders what game he\u2019s playing now. Trying to keep Harry at his side, of course, and having Harry look into his eyes is just a ploy to pretend he\u2019s sincere. Or possibly use Legilimency on him again. Harry would almost be glad of that. It would allow him to resolve the endless debate in his head in favor of walking away.\n\nHe\u2019s playing a lot of games. You\u2019re not as smart as he is, and not as Slytherin. You probably couldn\u2019t understand them even if he explained.\n\nHarry takes a deep breath and says, \u201cFine. Thank you. But I still don\u2019t know how these robes are going to look on me.\u201d He tugs on the blue robes that Riddle continues to hold, wondering exactly how ridiculous he\u2019ll look in them. With any luck, it\u2019ll be so bad that Riddle will back off.\nRiddle doesn\u2019t let the robes go. \u201cWho hurt you?\u201d he asks quietly. \u201cWill you allow me to punish them?\u201d\nHarry pictures Riddle stepping through the Veil in this world, hoping to go to Harry\u2019s world and find the Ministry who betrayed him but only showing up in more and more worlds to feature in various Harry Potters\u2019 nightmares, and begins to laugh.\nRiddle leans towards him. \u201cWhat sort of answer is that?\u201d\n\u201cOne that means you can\u2019t punish them because they\u2019re beyond your reach,\u201d Harry says, and tugs on the robes again.\n\u201cNo one is beyond my reach.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, now you sound like Voldemort,\u201d Harry says, and then winces when he realizes what he\u2019s said. He tugs hard on the robes and gets them away from Riddle, but probably because Riddle\u2019s hand has fallen nerveless back to his side.\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n\u201cNothing you need to repeat,\u201d Harry says, and prances away with the robes. Two fronds part in front of him, and a small mirrored room appears. Harry steps inside, shuts the door, and takes off his patched robes to try the blue ones on.\nHe can feel his heart beating frantically with the way that Riddle stared at him when he spoke that name. Possibly Harry won\u2019t have to act like a spoiled brat after all to get Riddle to back off.\n*\nTom stares blankly at the mirrored wall behind which Harry has vanished. He feels as if he has been given a huge jolt sideways and the room still hasn\u2019t realigned beneath his feet.\nHow did Harry know that name? It was one Tom entertained only in his head when he was a dramatic teenager investigating different ways of obtaining immortality. Well, yes, he might have told one other person. Possibly Abraxas Malfoy, who in those days was the closest thing to a friend Tom had.\nBut he discarded the idea once he realized how closely Dumbledore watched him and how much power Dumbledore would have once he defeated Grindelwald, which everyone expected of Dumbledore long before it happened. All that he needed was one suspicious death near him, and Tom could find Dumbledore\u2019s word closing all sorts of doors to him.\nSo, he swallowed his pride, persuaded Nicholas Flamel to accept him as an apprentice, and went down the path that took longer but was less risky. And he would have said he was satisfied with his life, up until the point when Harry grabbed it and forced it to spin around him.\n\nWhere did he learn that name?\n\nTom paces back and forth, plotting the best way to ask, until the mirrored door opens. He spins around, mouth already open.\nIt stays open. Harry steps out and tugs on the collar of the robe, frowning at his reflection.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t flattering at all,\u201d he complains.\nTom makes an inarticulate noise of disagreement. Nothing has ever been more flattering.\nHarry is skinnier than he should be, Tom can see that now, which probably comes from suffering under starvation wages from people who deserve to have their bellies split open and their intestines pulled out one loop at a time. But his body is slender in any case, and the robes will showcase it perfectly once Harry gains a little more weight. His eyes almost glow, his skin shines, in those robes. Tom cannot imagine that Harry has ever worn ones like them before, or he would have been married by now, but the wizard who wove them might have had Harry in mind.\n\u201cGet them,\u201d Tom says hoarsely, when he can clear his throat.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry looks at him as though he assumes this a practical joke.\nMerlin. Who told him what he looks like? Or has he just not made a habit of looking into mirrors?\n\u201cI insist on buying them for you,\u201d Tom says, and his eyes run over Harry\u2019s muscles and the skin around his ribs and waist that he can see now for the first time. \u201cYou look\u2014Harry, magnificent doesn\u2019t encompass it.\u201d\nHarry glares at him again. \u201cOh, come on. I know that you want to flatter me into helping you with whatever plot it is you have, but you don\u2019t need to heap me with extravagant words of praise anyone knows are false.\u201d\n\u201cHarry, I assure you\u2014\u201d Tom begins, while his brain whirls once more. Harry thinks this is all a plot? He doesn\u2019t believe that Tom desires him, wants to take him to bed and have him for the rest of his life? He didn\u2019t think the offer to marry him was sincere?\nHow could he not? What kind of life has he led?\nHarry rolls his eyes. \u201cLook, I want some robes, yes. I enjoyed the breakfast this morning, yes. But I can\u2019t be bought for that kind of coin. I\u2019ve had a Minister for Magic offer me a lot more than that, for a lot higher stakes.\u201d\nWho is he?\nHarry sighs, then, as if coming to some conclusion. \u201cI planned to take you for all I could,\u201d he mutters. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t do it because I can\u2019t keep my fucking mouth shut. Buy me these robes, and we\u2019ll call it even, okay? I\u2019ll leave, and then you don\u2019t have to look weak to anyone else or endure any public embarrassments I could cause\u2014and I\u2019d be pretty good at causing them. Oh, and I\u2019ll take the money for a Portkey to France.\u201d\nTom shakes his head and takes a step closer. Already, the thought of Harry leaving makes him feel as though something inside him has burned to ash, and he\u2019s trembling with the thought that he might never recover it again.\n\u201cHarry, please,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI do desire you. I don\u2019t want you for some plot or for some obscure kind of political advancement. I just want you.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re lying,\u201d Harry says doubtfully.\n\u201cI am not.\u201d Tom hesitates, but he doesn\u2019t see any other way to prove that he\u2019s telling the truth. Even if Harry doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s lying, he doesn\u2019t seem about to drop his plans to simply leave the country and go to France. \u201cDo you have any skill at Legilimency at all? Look into my eyes. I\u2019ll drop every shield I have and let you see everything I\u2019m thinking about you.\u201d\nHarry stares at him, and the eyerolls and sighs and doubt are gone in his shock. Tom will take it. He half-closes his eyes, dropping all his shields for the first time since he was fifteen, and then opens them again and meets Harry\u2019s gaze directly.\n\nSee me as I am. Understand me, soul-called.\n\n*\n\nI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s doing this.\n\nHarry can feel his face burning, but he also knows that there\u2019s no one around but them in this small corner of Glamoursall\u2019s, and it\u2019s unlikely that Riddle will ever grant him this privilege again. He\u2019ll break out of the fascination soon enough.\nI mean, yes, it does sound as though he\u2019s more enthralled with me than I thought, but how can you really be ready to marry someone you\u2019ve only met three times?\nHarry leans forwards and draws his wand as Riddle looks at him, his eyes different in a way that makes it seem as if a shadow has faded from them. \u201cLegilimens,\u201d Harry murmurs, his wand weaving the pattern he remembers.\nIt takes little effort to dart forwards and fall into Riddle\u2019s eyes. Perhaps Riddle is using his own magic to ease the way. Harry doesn\u2019t know, and he\u2019s too busy falling\u2014\nInto the center of a burning sun.\nThere\u2019s the memory of Riddle lying in the coma and hearing the song that symbolizes Harry\u2019s soul for the first time, his immediate curiosity and desire. Harry flinches a little. How lonely was Riddle, to think that a stranger\u2019s soul was that fascinating?\nSo long alone, whispers a thought to him that Harry thinks is Riddle\u2019s subconscious, not something he\u2019s deliberately shoving out there to try and entice Harry.\nThe memories of Riddle\u2019s time in the shop come to him, and how possessive, how covetous, he was when seeing Harry\u2019s power. Harry shifts, almost ready to break free of the hold Riddle\u2019s mind has on him. He doesn\u2019t want to be possessed, and he has already had enough of being coveted.\nThe moment comes when he leaves and Riddle walks into the alley to see what Harry did to his wards. Harry braces himself against what he assumes will be anger that someone else shares Riddle\u2019s supposedly unique gift.\nInstead, there is worship.\nHarry reels. The feeling washes over him and almost knocks him from his feet, never mind that he isn\u2019t actually there. Riddle wants to touch him, hold him, hoard him.\nHarry\u2019s breathing is loud and hoarse in his own ears when he finds the memory of their breakfast that morning and what Riddle feels as he watches him eat. The plotting of vengeance plays through the memory like music. That someone besides Ron and Hermione could want to hurt the people who hurt him is news to Harry.\nIs new. No one has ever gone that far before, felt that much. Ron and Hermione would have done almost anything for him, but not stormed the Ministry and cursed Kingsley and the Aurors.\nRiddle would. He would sacrifice any of his Aurors for Harry without a second thought. He is already dreaming about how he will break the spines and tear out the beating hearts of the ones who marched Harry to the Veil in chains.\nHarry breaks free by closing his eyes, finally, and taking a long, deep breath. He can feel Riddle\u2019s gaze on him now, a touch on his skin that weighs heavier than the cloth of the exquisite robes he\u2019s wearing.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t\u2014he can\u2019t\u2014\n\n\u201cYou at least believe me now, I hope.\u201d Riddle\u2019s voice is soft and cold. Harry doesn\u2019t have to open his eyes to know that Riddle has once again put his Occlumency shields in place, and anything else he had guarding his mind.\n\u201cI believe that you\u2019re utterly insane,\u201d Harry says, not looking at him.\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause no one becomes this obsessed with someone they just met, Riddle.\u201d Harry draws in one breath, and then another, and manages to open his eyes. This time, Riddle\u2019s gaze hits him harder than ever, knowing what\u2019s behind it. Harry turns and stares at himself in the mirror, in the mockingly beautiful robes that he knows he can\u2019t actually buy. \u201cI think it might be a side-effect of the spell that connected me to your soul. Or maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m the first different person you\u2019ve met in a long time, the first person who didn\u2019t behave like you expected them to. Or the first Parselmouth.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Riddle has retreated behind a veil of coldness, if his voice is any indication. Harry shivers and wishes he hadn\u2019t thought about veils.\n\u201cThat this is real for you, for right now,\u201d Harry says. \u201cBut it\u2019ll break, sooner or later. Probably just after I got settled into it and managed to escape thinking that it\u2019ll break. Then you\u2019ll be kicking me out, and you won\u2019t be obsessed anymore, and I\u2019ll have to go somewhere else and make a home again.\u201d\nRiddle doesn\u2019t respond. Harry smooths his hand down the sleeve of the robe he\u2019s wearing, enjoying the glide of the fabric. Then he sighs and reaches up to remove it. His plan won\u2019t work, anyway. He can\u2019t cheat Riddle out of things like this, not now that he knows what\u2019s behind his plans to buy them. It won\u2019t be real forever, but it\u2019s real to Riddle now.\n*\n\u201cDon\u2019t take them off.\u201d\nTom feels as if someone has scoured the inside of his brain with sandpaper. Harry\u2019s Legilimency was\u2014not gentle. It\u2019s obvious that he has barely any experience, and what experiences he does have came from him sharpening his claws on an enemy\u2019s mind.\nHarry turns to look at him, startled. Tom stares at him and wonders how, with all the secrets hiding behind his eyes, he can look so innocent and guileless. He might, might, understand power plays like the ones he thinks Tom\u2019s preparing to use on him, but it never seems to have occurred to him to undertake them himself.\nOr maybe he did, and that\u2019s part of the reason that Tom saw him being marched by Aurors in chains.\nTom touches the side of his skull for a moment, is reassured it\u2019s whole, and moves forwards a step, until he sees Harry tense. Then he stops. \u201cThey still look lovely on you.\u201d\nHarry studies him. \u201cI know you want me,\u201d he says. \u201cI saw that much in the memories. But you don\u2019t have to compliment me, you know, or make up lies, whichever it is. I can decide whether I should let you buy me things without being lied to or complimented.\u201d\nTom studies him back in silence, noticing the way that Harry\u2019s face gets pinker and pinker the longer he stands there. Then he shakes his head. \u201cDid no one ever compliment you at all?\u201d\n\u201cSure they did.\u201d Harry rolls his eyes. \u201cAnd every single person was someone who could turn their backs on me the minute the papers reported some stupid story about me or I did something they didn\u2019t like.\u201d\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d The question leaves Tom\u2019s lips without his permission.\n\u201cSomeone,\u201d Harry says with finality. He glances down at the robes and strokes their sleeves again the way he did a moment ago, and a quiver runs through him. Tom wants to sigh with relief that he understands this emotion, at least. Harry does want these beautiful robes, precisely because he seems never to have had anything like them.\n\u201cI will buy them for you,\u201d Tom says quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t think of it as strings attached. Think of it as the way I bought you breakfast this morning, as a way of making up for what I did when I invaded your privacy and your mind.\u201d\nHarry turns to consider him again. Whatever it is about Tom\u2019s words that strikes him differently this time, he spends some time weighing them. Tom waits, not looking down at Harry\u2019s revealed skin even though he\u2019d like to.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry says abruptly. \u201cBut nothing else has to be this expensive, you know.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I want it to be?\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019re a git.\u201d\nTom laughs, and Harry starts at the sound, as if he didn\u2019t think Tom capable of it. If he thought of Tom as Voldemort, however he learned that name, then that probably makes sense.\n\u201cChoose other less expensive robes if you want,\u201d Tom says, waving a hand. \u201cJust make sure that they fit you well and that they\u2019re what you actually want. If I\u2019m going to spend a lot of Galleons, it should be on something you can wear, not on something you\u2019ve just picked to make me spend more money.\u201d\nHarry visibly thinks about that some more, and then bares his teeth in a fierce grin. \u201cWhat if I keep up the fa\u00e7ade of spoiled child outside of the shop?\u201d\n\u201cIf it would make you happy, please do.\u201d\nOnce again, Harry seems uncomfortable with Tom\u2019s sincerity. But he looks away, and nods once, and vanishes into the spring forest section of the shop again to find something else that he likes, and which Tom is sure will look stunning on him, although perhaps not as much so as the blue robes.\nTom settles back, already plotting how he wants to ask his next questions, and what he can do to make Harry comfortable enough to answer them.\nBesides letting him go, which is utterly out of the question.\n*\nHarry leaves Glamoursall\u2019s wearing robes that he knows must make him look like the height of fashion. He\u2019s actually willing to believe Riddle that the startled glances people give them in Diagon Alley when they see him and Riddle together are either because of Riddle\u2019s position or because of how well the robes fit him, not because he looks freakish in them.\nNo one except Jenkins and his landlady, and a few of the Aurors, know who he is here. There\u2019s no one to gape at him because he\u2019s walking around with someone who was once his greatest enemy.\nHarry grimaces at the thought of that. He supposes his greatest enemy now is the Ministry, or at least the one in his old world. He has no need to antagonize this one. Having Riddle following him around is enough of a problem.\n\u201cI would like to know,\u201d Riddle says softly when they\u2019re nearly to the Apparition point Riddle has said they\u2019ll leave from to begin looking for places Harry can live, \u201chow you heard that name.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no mistaking which name it is, of course. Harry turns his head and smiles at Riddle, watching him relax, before he says, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m not telling you.\u201d\nRiddle stares at him for a second, and Harry can see a vein start to throb in his forehead. Harry straightens up a little, grinning. What? All he has to do is tell the truth, and Riddle\u2019s obsession with him already starts breaking? That\u2019s a lot simpler than his plan of acting like a spoiled brat.\nAlthough, he probably should have saved it until Riddle had at least paid for a lease on a flat or something. Or even bought him a house. He might be\u2014might have been\u2014obsessed enough to do that.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Riddle demands in Parseltongue. That causes a few people to stare at him in fear and reverence and greed.\nHarry doesn\u2019t want them to do that to him, so he shrugs and replies in English. No one is going to know what he\u2019s talking about anyway, when they can only understand half the conversation. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nHarry smiles, and lets the smile widen across his mouth as Riddle continues staring at him. \u201cBecause.\u201d\nRiddle makes an intensely frustrated noise, and closes his eyes for a second. They\u2019re standing near a small building that seems to be a sweet shop. Harry is more than happy to stop when Riddle does, watching that throbbing vein.\n\u201cThen answer me something else,\u201d Riddle snaps at last, his nostrils flaring as he opens his eyes and glares at Harry.\n\u201cIf I feel like it.\u201d\nRiddle appears to be on the verge of stomping his foot like an angry child. \u201cWhat have your past lovers been like? Have you slept with a man before? What do you like? What can I do to give you pleasure in bed?\u201d\nHarry feels as though his blush is trying to take over his entire body, and he breathes in slowly. He decides that he\u2019s going to speak in Parseltongue, and fuck Riddle for doing this to him. But the people who were closest to them are now giving them a wide berth, and he doesn\u2019t think that they\u2019ll hear his Parseltongue or automatically mob him if they do. \u201cHow would I know?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean? I am asking you a basic question. Do you not want to answer it?\u201d\nHarry glares at Riddle. Yes, he is all one giant blush, but once again, this seems like it might be a good opportunity to drive Riddle off, an even better one than before. He won\u2019t want to stick around once he knows Harry\u2019s answer to his questions.\n\u201cHow should I know,\u201d Harry asks slowly, \u201cwhen I\u2019ve never slept with anyone before?\u201d\n*\nHarry\u2019s answer drops into Tom\u2019s skull and rattles around, in the same space that feels scoured clean by Harry\u2019s Legilimency.\nEmotions claw at him, so many that Tom doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s feeling at first, and then he doesn\u2019t know which is deepest, which he should act on first, what he should do other than stare at Harry like a gormless fool with his mouth open.\n\nThey ostracized him\u2014\n\n\nNo one has ever told him what he looks like when he\u2019s wearing robes like\u2014\n\n\nThey arrested him\u2014\n\n\nHe knows the name I never told anyone except Abraxas\u2014\n\nHe\u2019s a virgin\u2014\nEventually, Tom does settle on one thought, one that rises to the surface of his mind and refuses to be silenced.\nWhat kind of fools was he living with? How has no one snapped him up before now?\nThen again, it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that Harry can be Tom\u2019s, and Tom has yet another new experience to offer him.\nTom manages to control his breathing, and his desire to shout, especially when he\u2019s not sure that it would be in triumph or fury. He offers Harry a small smile. \u201cI would still like to discuss this with you, but we don\u2019t need to do it right now,\u201d he says, watching Harry\u2019s shoulders relax at the return to English. \u201cPerhaps we can discuss this over dinner? Or we can talk in privacy, and you could tell me what you would need to trust me.\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be willing to give it to me.\u201d\n\u201cWould I not?\u201d\nTom lowers his voice a little, drops his masks a little, to let the expressions on his face if not the emotions in his mind through. Harry gasps, and for one instant, Tom thinks he\u2019s about to run away.\nThen he firms his shoulders and stares at Tom speculatively. Tom keeps silent. He would wager a thousand Galleons that Harry\u2019s profound loneliness and lack of good experiences with people in what seems to be the vast majority of his life are driving his reaction, as much as his trust in what he glimpsed in Tom\u2019s mind.\nBut Tom doesn\u2019t really care for the means, if he can attain the end.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere private, then,\u201d Harry says, with a tilt of his head, another gesture that proves he was perhaps living on a whole planet of fools. \u201cAnd you can show me whether you\u2019re willing to swear an Unbreakable Vow to keep my secrets.\u201d\nHarry glances around and nods slowly. He vetoed going back to Riddle\u2019s office at the Ministry, although he thinks Riddle suspected he would from the close way he watches Harry. So Riddle\u2019s house it is.\nRiddle\u2019s mansion, that is. Harry wouldn\u2019t mind having a place of his own, but what in the world does one person need all these rooms for? From the way that Riddle\u2019s cloak disappeared when he held it out, he does have at least one house-elf, but otherwise, there are sprawling, silent drawing rooms, a whole room that seems to just be for keeping Floo powder, a ballroom that must be uninhabited most of the time, mountains of bedrooms\u2026\nIt feels wasteful to Harry, and he hopes that if he does allow Riddle to buy him a house, Riddle won\u2019t suggest looking for places like this.\n\u201cWe are under the strongest wards I can manage,\u201d Riddle says, flicking his wand around the blue sitting room he\u2019s chosen without taking his eyes off Harry. He always seems to fear that Harry will vanish or something. Harry can see echoes of the way Voldemort looked at him, but he\u2019s no longer invested in looking for parallels.\n\nAlthough, who knows? After he hears that I killed his alternate self in another universe, maybe he\u2019ll want me dead, too.\n\nHarry finds himself hoping it won\u2019t be so. The thought of having one person he can talk to about being from a different universe, his loneliness, the way his old Ministry turned on him, is\u2026\nIt would be everything. If he can trust it.\n\u201cAll right, I accept that the wards are strong,\u201d Harry adds, when he sees Riddle still staring at him. \u201cNow for your Vow.\u201d\nRiddle immediately holds out his hand. Harry does the same, taking the chestnut wand from his holster in case he\u2019ll need it. It stirs sullenly and spits a few red sparks he didn\u2019t tell it to spit. It really doesn\u2019t like him.\n\nYou could change that. \n\nHarry ignores the thought, the effort effortless by now, and stares at Riddle. \u201cI want you to swear that you\u2019ll never tell any secret I communicate to you in this conversation by any means, speaking or writing, or looking at someone and trying to put it in their mind with Legilimency, or\u2014anything else you can think of.\u201d Honestly, letting Riddle word the Vow is probably better than Harry doing it, since he could probably think of all sorts of weird contingencies that would never occur to Harry.\nRiddle immediately and smoothly lifts his wand to the height of his temple, then sweeps it down in a broad gesture. Their joined hands glow. \u201cI swear never to communicate any secret Harry tells me to any other being, living or dead, human or house-elf or other species, by means of writing, speaking, Legilimency, Occlumency, hinting, dancing around the subject, indirect speech, comparison, contrast, offering clues, referring to Harry by any last name or other name he might reveal, asking questions in front of others, trying to embarrass him\u2026\u201d\nOn it goes. It must be the longest Unbreakable Vow in the history of Unbreakable Vows. Harry stares at him in a daze until Riddle finally finishes, not even sounding out of breath, the bastard. He lowers his wand and smiles at Harry, that deep thing he does where the smile seems to pierce directly into the center of his eyes and the center of Harry\u2019s brain.\n\u201cYou\u2014you didn\u2019t need to do that,\u201d Harry says weakly. \u201cYou could get killed all kinds of ways, with what you just swore.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Riddle gives him a bright smile. \u201cMy magic will warn me, the closer I come to breaking the Vow.\u201d\nHarry continues staring at him, only taking his hand away when Riddle squeezes it once. \u201cAnd\u2014I just asked you to swear that you wouldn\u2019t tell any secret I revealed to you in this conversation. Not any secret ever.\u201d\n\u201cMy darling,\u201d Riddles hisses in Parseltongue, his eyes brightening to the point where it\u2019s like being stared at by the sun. \u201cI want you to feel that you can trust me. With whatever comes to mind, whatever you want to say. Whether it is now or in two weeks or a hundred years from now.\u201d\nHarry shivers a little. Riddle is still a force of nature who has instincts and priorities Harry doesn\u2019t understand (like proposing marriage to someone he\u2019s just met), but he is bound now, by his own choice.\nHarry might be able to trust him.\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Harry licks his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in the bowels of the Ministry here or not, but in the Ministry in the world where I came from\u2014the Department of Mysteries\u2014there\u2019s a veil that sounds like it has the voices of dead people whispering in it. That\u2019s what they pushed me through. And that\u2019s how I wound up here. I know things like the name Voldemort because I knew them in that world.\u201d\nIt feels so good to say it. But Harry keeps his eyes on Riddle, for any sign that this is overwhelming him or\u2014\nOr, well. He might lose his fascination with Harry once he figures out the biggest source of his secrets. And then he would let Harry go, while still being bound by the Vow from telling anyone Harry\u2019s secrets.\nBest of both worlds, that, Harry thinks, and then snorts at the irony.\n*\nTom feels as if someone has lit a star inside him.\n\nAnother world. He comes from another world. \n\nAnd then another thought, hard on the heels of that one: I could so easily never have met him. It was pure chance that I did. \nTom shivers at the realization, and does his best to keep his eyes focused on Harry and his expression quiet and open and receptive. \u201cI am unaware if there is a similar veil in our Department of Mysteries,\u201d he admits. \u201cI trust that you did not find yourself there.\u201d\n\u201cNo. In a random alley, with no wand\u2014I mean, I had no wand when they threw me through the Veil, of course\u2014and no money.\u201d Harry lifts his chin. \u201cI had to start all over. And I was doing all right until you interfered.\u201d\nYou were half-starved. You were not all right. But Tom holds back the impulse to say it. The argument they could have about that doesn\u2019t matter\u2014not right now. \u201cWill you tell me why they threw you through the Veil?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s teeth flash. \u201cYou sound as if you think I was guilty.\u201d\n\u201cI presume they had a reason. That doesn\u2019t mean it was rational.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, all right.\u201d Harry gnaws his lip for a second. \u201cI do have to give you the whole story for that, because otherwise it won\u2019t make any sense that they thought I was a Dark Lord lying about my power.\u201d\nTom stares at him and once again feels as though someone has scrubbed the inside of his skull with sandpaper. \u201cYou? A Dark Lord?\u201d\nHarry rolls his eyes, but doesn\u2019t get drawn into what Tom thinks he must deem an unproductive debate. \u201cMy full name is Harry Potter.\u201d Tom mouths it to himself, finding it fitting. \u201cWhen I was born, or just before I was born, there was a prophecy made that said a child born at the time I was had the power to defeat a Dark Lord.\u201d\nHarry looks straight at Tom. \u201cThe Dark Lord\u2019s name was Voldemort.\u201d\nTom could do without the constant sensation of having the world reel under him, but he suspects that he\u2019ll need to get used to it if he spends time with Harry. He breathes out, hard. \u201cYou\u2014you killed an alternate version of myself.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nHarry is watching him with such care that it takes Tom a moment to realize he\u2019s holding his breath, too. Tom quickly shakes his head and reaches out to glance a hand down Harry\u2019s elbow, just possible at the distance apart they\u2019re sitting. \u201cI won\u2019t hate you for that, darling. I could never hate you for that.\u201d\nHarry eyes him and says, \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard the full story yet. You haven\u2019t heard what happened. You could still hate me.\u201d\nHe sounds a little hopeful. Tom gives him a faint, mean smile. \u201cStill hoping to drive me away, Harry? What I know is that you survived him. And that is what matters to me. You matter more to me than any alternate version of myself ever could. If he was competition for you, of course\u2014\u201d\nHarry yelps and draws away, shaking his head frantically. \u201cOf course not!\u201d\n\u201cThen I have nothing to worry about.\u201d Tom gives him a winsome smile that Harry doesn\u2019t seem to find reassuring, if the way he\u2019s grimacing is anything to go by. \u201cBut I would appreciate hearing the rest of the story.\u201d\nHarry nods, hesitantly, and seems to be thinking. Tom waits, contenting himself with watching the rise and fall of Harry\u2019s chest, the way his cheeks are flushed instead of pale, how vivid and alive his eyes are.\n\nHe could have died at any time. At Voldemort\u2019s hands. When they threw him through the Veil, or if someone thought he was a Dark Lord and was hunting him down. But he survived, and he is here, and he is mine.\n\nAll the chances against it. I will not set myself against it, no matter what he tells me.\n*\nRiddle\u2019s attention is patient and endless. Harry swears, apparently not enough beneath his breath to avoid Riddle\u2019s hearing. It makes his lips quirk up, but still he says nothing, waiting as if he thinks Harry needs more time to gather his thoughts.\nHarry breathes out. \u201cVoldemort came after me and my parents when I was fifteen months old. A combination of circumstances that I think I still don\u2019t really understand saved my life. My father died, and my mother gave her life for mine. And when Voldemort attacked me with the Killing Curse, it rebounded and\u2014well, not killed him, not really. He\u2019d made Horcruxes, and he couldn\u2019t die. But his soul was so unstable that the spell made him into a wraith, and part of his soul broke off and stuck into mine.\u201d Harry gestures towards his forehead, and then reminds himself that that\u2019s stupid as Riddle\u2019s eyes follow his hand. Riddle hasn\u2019t given any sign that he\u2019s noticed the scar until now. And shouldn\u2019t Harry not want attention like that from him?\n\u201cI see,\u201d Riddle breathes, although Harry has no idea what he\u2019s really saying. \u201cHorcruxes were something I considered. I am glad that I never pursued that path.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you do instead?\u201d Harry asks, because he can\u2019t see any version of Tom Riddle giving up on attaining immortality. Not really.\nRiddle looks briefly startled, and then smiles a little. \u201cSometimes I forget that you\u2019re not from this world, my dear. Everyone knows it already who was born here. I managed to obtain an apprenticeship with Nicholas Flamel, and he taught me how to make my own Philosopher\u2019s Stone.\u201d\nHarry sags back against the chair he\u2019s sitting on.\n\u201cHarry?\u201d\nRiddle\u2019s voice is sharp, and Harry blinks and shakes his head and sits up, reminding himself that Riddle seems to care for him, for\u2014some reason\u2014and will take it badly if Harry seems weak or injured. \u201cUntil now,\u201d he admits, \u201cI didn\u2019t know for sure that you didn\u2019t have Horcruxes. It\u2019s a relief to know that you don\u2019t.\u201d\nRiddle nods, eyes still like the eyes of a waiting predator. \u201cAnd he made you a living Horcrux?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Harry nibbles his lip. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the reason our souls connect so well. Sorry if that disappoints you.\u201d And he does mean it, somewhat to his surprise. It would mean the end of Riddle\u2019s obsession, which would be a good thing for Harry, but be a devastating thing for Riddle.\n\u201cIt does not,\u201d Riddle says. \u201cBecause you are here, and it is my soul that you found your connection to, not his. You are not his.\u201d He looks extremely smug as he says that.\n\u201cIs there anything about me that would put you off? I mean, I know that knowing I killed your alternate dimension\u2019s counterpart doesn\u2019t, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt would take much.\u201d Riddle speaks softly, leaning forwards as if he thinks that Harry might simply Apparate before his eyes, despite the heavy wards on the house. \u201cAnd so far, nothing you have told me makes you less desirable to me, Harry. Am I right in that Voldemort pursued you relentlessly, trying again and again to kill you, and declaring you a threat to his safety even when you might have wished to simply retreat from the war?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry whispers. Then he rallies enough to add, \u201cI suppose you would know all about relentless pursuit.\u201d\n*\nTom only smiles. Harry\u2019s reservations towards him make so much sense now, and the more he can differentiate himself from Voldemort, the better. But giving up this \u201crelentless pursuit\u201d is not one of the ways he intends to employ.\nHarry is too glorious not to be his.\n\u201cTell me a little more about him,\u201d Tom coaxes. \u201cI know that your parents died in your first confrontation with him, but did no one else raise you? Did you not have adults who could stand between you and the murderous threat Voldemort posed?\u201d\nHarry snorts, in a way that freezes Tom\u2019s heart. No, that snort says. No, I had to fend for myself.\nIt is almost exactly like what a young and bitter Tom Riddle might have whispered to himself at night in a Muggle orphanage as bombs fell all around him.\n\u201cMy mum and dad died, yeah,\u201d Harry says dully. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t have any more magical relatives left. The war had gone on for a long time and killed my dad\u2019s relatives, and my mother was a Muggleborn. So I was left with her Muggle relatives. My aunt and uncle and cousin.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not like them,\u201d Tom says.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t like me!\u201d Harry fires up as if he thinks that Tom is judging him for something. \u201cThey called me freak all the time, and my cousin chased me around and beat me up with his friends and kept me from having any friends, and they didn\u2019t tell me about the wizarding world even though they knew! They made me do all the chores, and they didn\u2019t feed me all the time, and they made me sleep in a cupboard\u2014\u201d\nThe table to Tom\u2019s left disintegrates. It\u2019s a nice oak table, one that he\u2019s had for a long time, and he treasured it. But it was release his magic in that direction or potentially release it straight at Harry in his longing to make what he says not be true, and between Harry and the table, of course his choice would be Harry.\nHarry blinks and shuts up, though, which isn\u2019t something Tom wished. He says softly in Parseltongue, \u201cThat was me, not you, darling. I\u2019m sorry. But I have never before hated someone so much without meeting them, except your Voldemort.\u201d And as he might have hated past lovers of Harry\u2019s, but that is not something he has to worry about, at least.\nHarry finally nods, shortly, choppily. \u201cAnyway. I was so happy when my Hogwarts letter came, and I found out that I was magical and I could go to a school far, far away from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. But then I found out that I was famous for surviving the Killing Curse. They called me the Boy-Who-Lived all the time. And they expected me to be some miraculous hero who could defeat Voldemort again at the end of my first year.\u201d\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Tom breathes, utterly certain of it.\nHarry tosses him a look of loathing. \u201cIf you can call killing the host his spirit was possessing by accident and without even knowing what I was doing, then yes.\u201d\nTom closes his eyes. He knows something of what Voldemort must have been like, to survive as a wraith. He understands, intimately, the creature\u2019s endless fear of death. He imagines what that must have been like for Harry to face, and flinches.\n\u201cRiddle? Are you okay?\u201d\nTom opens his eyes and nods slowly. \u201cI am picturing what it must have been like from your point-of-view. I\u2019m sorry you had to endure that, Harry.\u201d\n*\n\nDid anyone ever tell me that? \n\nIn the chaos of his thoughts and the rush of his blood, Harry honestly can\u2019t remember. Maybe Dumbledore did say that to him, when Harry woke in the hospital wing after Quirrell\u2019s death and Voldemort\u2019s retreat. Maybe Ron or Hermione said it.\nBut he can\u2019t remember. What matters is that someone here, now, in this world he\u2019s always thought of as alien and hostile and one that he can\u2019t allow anyone to know the real him or his history in, is telling him.\nHarry closes his eyes to hold back the tears that are threatening to creep out. God, the last thing he wants to do is look weak and pathetic in front of this man.\n\u201cHarry?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Harry whispers back in Parseltongue, and when he opens his eyes again, the tears are gone. \u201cAnyway. That started kind of a pattern. Every year after that, the Defense professors\u2014the man Voldemort was possessing was the Defense professor\u2014tried to kill me. Well, I suppose sixth year doesn\u2019t technically count, but all the others, yeah.\u201d\nRiddle draws in a harsh, meaningless breath that Harry supposes is one Parseltongue equivalent of swearing. \u201cWhat happened in your second year?\u201d\n\u201cA Horcrux got into the school and possessed a student.\u201d Harry swallows against the memory of it. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s even his worst memory. That would his mum\u2019s death, or maybe the graveyard and Voldemort\u2019s resurrection, or the march to the Veil. \u201cShe was opening the Chamber of Secrets and letting the basilisk out.\u201d\n\u201cThe basilisk,\u201d Riddle repeats in a flat tone.\n\u201cYeah, didn\u2019t you\u2014\u201d Harry stares at him, suddenly curious. \u201cOh, wait. You didn\u2019t make Horcruxes. So you never did find the Chamber of Secrets and let the monster out, then? You didn\u2019t know what it was?\u201d\n\u201cI did not.\u201d Riddle\u2019s voice is extremely tense and clipped.\nBy now, Harry does actually trust him enough to think that the tension is for him. He nods. \u201cSo. It turned out that the basilisk was Petrifying people. They were all lucky enough to see it through reflections\u2014mirrors, puddles of water, camera lenses, that kind of thing. And of course, people thought it was me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\n\u201cThe language we\u2019re speaking,\u201d Harry hisses back, and continues in English. \u201cMessages from the Heir of Slytherin were being left on the walls. I accidentally revealed that I was a Parselmouth during a duel, and a bunch of students decided I was evil and to be shunned.\u201d\nRiddle closes his eyes for a long moment.\n\u201cThen a message appeared that said Ginny\u2014my best friend\u2019s little sister\u2014had been taken down into the Chamber, and her skeleton would lie there forever.\u201d Harry swallows, because yeah, it is harder to talk about than he thought. \u201cI followed her down there, with my friend, but a rockslide happened and trapped him and I had to go on alone. I found the diary with Tom Riddle\u2019s\u2014I mean, sorry, young Voldemort\u2019s\u2014shade almost completely human because he was draining Ginny. I defied him, and he called forth the basilisk.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d Riddle says, in the tone of someone peering through their fingers at a horror film, \u201can adult came and rescued you.\u201d\n\u201cNo. Then the Sorting Hat came down with Fawkes, Dumbledore\u2019s phoenix, and the Sword of Gryffindor fell out of it. I fought the basilisk and killed it, but it stabbed a fang through my arm.\u201d Harry touches the sleeve over his scar without thinking, and Riddle\u2019s gaze goes there as if riveted. \u201cI would have died if Fawkes hadn\u2019t wept for me. I took the fang and destroyed the diary. I didn\u2019t know that it was a Horcrux then or that basilisk venom could do for them, but that destroyed Voldemort\u2019s shade and rescued Ginny.\u201d\nRiddle lowers his head into his hands. \u201cThere is no way to make up for what that alternate version of myself did to you,\u201d he whispers.\n\u201cYes, there is,\u201d Harry snaps. \u201cMy survival makes up for it. Or did you think that I did nothing but lie around feeling sorry for myself all day and that my main thought on seeing you was angst and trauma from that and not being angry that you were violating my privacy?\u201d\n*\nTom lowers his hands again and stares at Harry. Harry stares back, his teeth all but bared, as if daring Tom to consider him weak.\n\nHe killed a basilisk and a Horcrux when he was twelve. \n\nTom does not know what to say. He did not know the universe contained such people. Of course, a few days ago, he didn\u2019t know that the universe contained Harry, but this still feels like the bigger shock.\nAnd yet Harry is willing to sit, here, in the same room with a version of the man who almost killed him.\n\u201cYour third year?\u201d Tom asks, after a long breath.\n\u201cMy godfather, who supposedly betrayed my parents to their deaths, escaped from Azkaban. Except it turned out he was innocent, and hunting the real traitor, who had been hiding in his Animagus form as my best friend\u2019s pet rat.\u201d Harry sighs. \u201cWe almost captured him, but he escaped when my Defense professor turned into a werewolf and almost killed us.\u201d\n\u201cYour Defense professor turned into a werewolf.\u201d\n\u201cI mean, he always was one,\u201d Harry says hastily. \u201cBut he forgot his Wolfsbane potion that evening, and yeah. He distracted us, and Peter Pettigrew escaped and Sirius had to go on the run.\u201d Harry pauses, and his eyes turn wistful. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s a Sirius Black or a Peter Pettigrew here? Or a Remus Lupin.\u201d\nTom hesitates. But in that moment, Harry\u2019s eyes sharpen, and he leans forwards.\n\u201cYou do know them.\u201d\n\u201cI have never heard of a Peter Pettigrew,\u201d Tom says, telling the absolute truth. \u201cBut, sadly, I must tell you that Sirius Black was killed by a werewolf in his fifth year at Hogwarts. I do not know the werewolf\u2019s name. He was Kissed by a Dementor immediately after that. It may have been Remus Lupin.\u201d\nHarry shrinks backwards, looking a little shocked. Tom cannot resist, and reaches out to put a hand on his knee.\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI wish I did not have to be the bearer of bad news.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Harry says, blinking rapidly. He lets Tom\u2019s hand stay where it is. Even that little show of trust makes Tom\u2019s chest burn with longing.\n\u201cAnd then? Did your godfather not object when they threw you through the Veil?\u201d\n\u201cHe died at the end of my fifth year,\u201d Harry says, and his eyes close again. \u201cVoldemort lured me to the Department of Mysteries so that he could make me retrieve the prophecy, which I didn\u2019t know about then. Sirius was fighting his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, and fell through the Veil on accident. I\u2014I hoped I would have gone to the same world he went to when I woke up, but I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\nTom has to shake his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry. You\u2019re the only one I\u2019ve ever heard of appearing here like this, and I\u2019d never heard of the Veil, either, before you told me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Harry says. \u201cI\u2014I deliberately didn\u2019t seek out any news about them because I wanted to avoid everyone, but I don\u2019t suppose you know anything about James and Lily Potter? They were my parents.\u201d\n\u201cJames Potter moved out of the country when he was twenty,\u201d Tom says. He remembers that because people in the Wizengamot gossiped about it endlessly, claiming it was because Potter was denied entrance to the Auror program on account of his wildness. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he was married.\u201d\n\u201cIn a way, that makes it easier,\u201d Harry says. \u201cNot to encounter another version of myself.\u201d\nTom nods, hoping that James and Lily, if they married, did not have a son whom they named Harry. He suspects his Harry is unique in all the worlds, and he would like to keep it that way.\n\u201cYour fourth year,\u201d he prods gently.\n\u201cI was entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament by a servant of Voldemort\u2019s disguised, of course, as the Defense professor.\u201d Harry rolls his eyes. \u201cI fought a dragon, went through some other Tasks, and then got kidnapped and taken to a graveyard where\u2014where Peter Pettigrew killed the other Hogwarts student I was with, a boy named Cedric Diggory.\u201d Tom opens his mouth to tell Harry that Cedric Diggory is alive and well, but Harry is rushing on. \u201cThen Voldemort used me in a resurrection ritual, taking my blood to build himself a new body.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me, he did what.\u201d\nTom feels as if the part of him that was burning earlier has now frozen solid. He wants to destroy things. But this time, the magic stays caged up in his body, because no release of it as destruction would be enough. This was years ago, in a different time, and the man who did it is dead.\nProbably more than dead, given what Tom knows about Horcruxes.\nHarry nods and rolls up his sleeve to show a scar on his arm. Tom lets his fingers glance over it. Old, and healed-over. But he will touch it, he will kiss it if Harry lets him, he will hold it and prize it and treasure it as much as any other part of Harry.\n\u201cHe forced me to bow, but then I threw off his Imperius Curse.\u201d Harry smiles a little as if he hasn\u2019t just said something remarkable, his gaze distant. \u201cHe tortured me with the Cruciatus Curse, too. But I escaped.\u201d He sighs. \u201cThen the papers and the Minister, who didn\u2019t want to admit Voldemort was back, spent the next year smearing my name and calling me insane.\u201d\nTom considers whether he ought to make a study of the Veil and lob something through it capable of burning a whole dimension to dust and ashes. Nothing like that exists right now, he is aware. It does not matter. He will invent it.\nHarry stares at him curiously and lifts his hand to pull his sleeve down. Something about the glint of the light on his right hand catches Tom\u2019s attention. He turns Harry\u2019s hand over, and sees the scars etched into the back of it.\n\nI must not tell lies.\n\nA Blood Quill.\n\u201cIs there no violation you have not suffered?\u201d Tom bursts out before he can stop himself.\n\u201cWell, you know I\u2019ve never been raped,\u201d Harry says dryly.\nTom glares at him helplessly. But Harry is not the person he wants to glare at, and in any case, Harry simply meets his glare unflinchingly, shaking his head a little while his eyebrows rise.\n\u201cYour Defense professor?\u201d he asks, gesturing to the scars. It is the only thing that makes any logical sense, and he clings to logic to avoid drowning in his rage.\nHarry nods. \u201cMy fifth year. She worked for the Ministry, and tried to make me stop telling people Voldemort was back.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cAnd then the year ended with the Ministry battle I told you about, and---well, in sixth year, Dumbledore started giving me lessons on the Horcruxes, without telling me I was one. He had found one and destroyed it, but he was dying from the curse on it.\u201d\nTom experiences a sharp, savage struggle between his pride that an alternate version of Tom Riddle managed to kill Albus Dumbledore and his disgust that he has never been able to do it himself.\n\u201cThe sixth year ended when we went after a Horcrux in another place, and I had to force-feed Dumbledore a poison that I\u2019m sure would have killed him faster.\u201d Harry shudders a little. \u201cThe Horcrux we found turned out to be a fake, too, so even that effort was wasted. And my Defense professor killed Dumbledore.\u201d\n\nThere, it wasn\u2019t Voldemort.\n\n\u201cIt turned out to be a set-up\u2026\u201d Harry trails off. \u201cHe was an active Death Eater\u2014a follower of Voldemort\u2014at one time, and then he turned to Dumbledore because he loved my mother. So they set things up so he could kill Dumbledore and earn Voldemort\u2019s trust. But Voldemort even killed him in the end.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you? How did you remove the Horcrux from your soul?\u201d\nHarry fidgets. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to like this,\u201d he says, after long moments of Tom staring at him and the silence drawing out.\n\u201cI like almost none of this except the fact that you survived,\u201d Tom snaps. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d\n\u201cI walked to my death,\u201d Harry says. \u201cDumbledore told Snape\u2014the professor who killed him\u2014that I was a Horcrux, and he managed to get the memories to me. And the only way to be sure that the Horcrux in me was killed was for me to let Voldemort shoot the Killing Curse at me.\u201d\n\u201cHarry.\u201d\nTom thinks this might be what heartbreak feels like. He extends his arms, and Harry leans a little towards him, although not actually coming within the circle of his embrace.\n\u201cI survived,\u201d Harry whispers to him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d For a moment, his hand glances across Tom\u2019s.\n\u201cHow?\u201d\nHarry shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m honestly not sure. Because the Killing Curse killed the Horcrux, I think, and not me. And then it turned out that the wand Voldemort was using was Dumbledore\u2019s wand, which another Death Eater had taken from him, and then I took the Death Eater\u2019s wand. So Voldemort\u2019s wand was answering to me. I lived. He died. Finally.\u201d\n\u201cYou lived,\u201d Tom whispers. \u201cAnd then they cast you through the Veil.\u201d\nHarry nods wearily. \u201cWord about the Horcruxes spread around. I don\u2019t know for sure how many people knew that I\u2019d been a Horcrux, but they considered me tainted, at least. And the next Dark Lord. They thought I was lying about the extent of my power. I was held in a cell for a week without anything to sit or sleep on until the Aurors marched me to the Veil in chains. You know, the memory you stole.\u201d But his words have no fire behind them.\n\u201cNo wonder you\u2019re terrified of Aurors,\u201d Tom murmurs.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Harry looks straight at him. \u201cSo. What do you think? You really don\u2019t mind that I killed an alternate version of you?\u201d\n*\nHarry is waiting.\nIt feels good, so good, to tell the truth to someone at last, and have them sympathize with him, even if it is Tom fucking Riddle. In some ways, it\u2019s even good that it\u2019s him, because he knows about Horcruxes and can sympathize with what Harry went through in a way that no one but Ron and Hermione in his past world ever could.\nBut now\u2026\nIt\u2019s been rejection before, every time in the past. His whole damn world rejected him, except for two people. Fellow students rejected him for not being what they wanted, for supposedly being a cheater or a delusional liar or a mad killer.\nRiddle\u2019s not going to be different. Maybe he thinks that he can tolerate the knowledge Harry killed an alternate version of him, but when he actually thinks about it, it\u2019ll be the same. Rejection.\nMaybe then, Harry can go back to his peaceful life. Somewhere else.\nRiddle stares at him, face blank except for a slightly open moth. Harry can\u2019t tell what he\u2019s thinking, but he glares back anyway.\nRiddle leans forwards, moving slowly. Harry waits for it. The shout, the slap, the curse. Not but that he\u2019ll fight back if it\u2019s a curse.\n\u201cYou are here,\u201d Riddle whispers. \u201cAlive.\u201d\nHarry waits.\n\u201cIt is the greatest gift I have ever received.\u201d\nIt\u2019s Harry\u2019s turn to stare now, and even though he\u2019s not as good at reading people as Riddle is, he thinks he\u2019s right.\nThe fucker is telling the truth.\nAnd something breaks open inside Harry, and reaches for the sun.\n\u201cIf you would tell the truth, we would let you go.\u201d\nHarry gritted his teeth and did his best to ignore the liar standing outside his cell in the robes of an Auror. Harry had his arms looped around his legs and his blazing eyes fastened on the far wall of the cell. He refused to look at his tormentor. This same man had come back, day after day, but had never even told Harry his name.\n\u201cKingsley Shacklebolt thinks so, too.\u201d\nSo Kingsley is part of this, and he never even bothered to come see me himself, Harry thought bitterly. Or maybe they\u2019re just claiming to speak in his name, and he can\u2019t exert himself to get me freed.\nOr maybe Kingsley was trying, but those political efforts were as self-serving as those of the Aurors and the Unspeakables, who pretended they would free him if he only told them what they wanted to know.\n\u201cCome, Mr. Potter. Is telling the truth such a huge sacrifice? You get your life back if you do. You are free from the taint of everyone thinking you are a Dark Lord or a Horcrux. Why resist such a small thing?\u201d\nHarry swung his head around and glared. He probably shouldn\u2019t have, but then again, nothing he said could make the situation any worse unless it made them hit him with the Cruciatus or something. \u201cI already told you the fucking truth.\u201d\n\u201cClearly you did not,\u201d the Auror replied quickly, stepping up to the bars. He was a tall man with pale skin and blue eyes and a neatly-groomed black beard, and Harry hated him as he had only hated Voldemort before. \u201cYou are as powerful as you are because you wield the Elder Wand. Just tell us where it is. We searched your home and didn\u2019t find it.\u201d\n\u201cI told you! I put it back in Dumbledore\u2019s tomb!\u201d\nThe Auror sighed. \u201cNo one in their right mind would do that, and I do still think that you\u2019re in your right mind, Mr. Potter. Just stubborn.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go look in the tomb if you don\u2019t believe me?\u201d\nThe Auror hesitated for long enough that Harry stared into his face again. The man was frowning, his eyes direct but under a shadow. Harry found himself mildly interested in what the wanker had to say for the first time.\n\u201cWe cannot open the tomb,\u201d the Auror admitted finally. \u201cWe sought permission from the Headmistress and were refused. We can\u2019t confirm one way or another that you\u2019re lying, but we all know that you didn\u2019t demonstrate unusual signs of power when you defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. The power you\u2019ve shown since must be a result of the wand.\u201d\nHarry fell on his back and began to laugh. The Auror stared at him, stiff and frowning, until Harry\u2019s hysterical chuckles died away to nothing.\n\u201cWhat is so funny, Mr. Potter?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014you arrest me, with no legal justification for doing so,\u201d Harry finally managed to choke out, \u201cbut you pretend you can\u2019t confirm what I\u2019m saying because of a petty little legal rule like the Headmistress refusing you permission? You only care about laws when it comes to people who aren\u2019t me?\u201d\nAnd as soon as he\u2019d said that, he realized that yes, it was true. The Ministry wouldn\u2019t have tried most people before a full court of the Wizengamot for underage magic, would they? Only Harry, because he was special.\nMost kids wouldn\u2019t have been smeared in the newspapers during their fifth year, or called insane and a liar by the whole population of the school. But most kids had parents who would stand up for them. Harry hadn\u2019t. The adults who cared about him had been fugitives, or more preoccupied with keeping the truth from Voldemort than anything else.\nThe Ministry could do whatever they wanted to him. No one but Ron and Hermione was going to care.\nHarry shut his eyes, feeling sick.\n\u201cWhy are you so difficult, Potter?\u201d the Auror hissed.\nHarry could have responded, but he saw no reason to do so. He lay there while the Auror explained, or ranted, about the Ministry\u2019s respect for Hogwarts and the need to hold together the wizarding world\u2019s morale after the war by not interfering with the rightful Headmistress\u2019s orders, and so on.\n\nThey didn\u2019t care about the morale when they arrested me.\n\nBut Harry knew that trying to explain that would just get him another rant. So he lay there, staring at the ceiling, while the Auror ran down and glared at him. Harry knew it was a glare of hatred. He didn\u2019t have to turn his head for that.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be Kissed,\u201d the Auror finally spat, and stormed off.\nHarry lay there and thought about it. Some of his visitors had talked about the Kiss and some had talked about him being thrown through the Veil. At the moment, Harry had no idea, for sure, what was going to happen.\n\nEither way, nothing I can do at this point will change things.\n\nThe lights flickered off, the way they always did when a visitor departed. Harry rolled over and did his best to sleep.\n*\n\u201cAre you all right? You look like you didn\u2019t sleep last night.\u201d\nTom, who has opened his mouth to ask that question himself, blinks and closes his mouth again. He watches a pale-faced Harry with dark circles under his eyes look anxiously at him, and has to hold back the impulse to preen.\n\u201cYou look terrible,\u201d Tom says.\nHarry snorts. \u201cDon\u2019t change the subject. You look like you were tossing and turning all night. Was it too\u2014wearing to hear about what I went through in my original world?\u201d He watches Tom with a flippant smile that doesn\u2019t hide his anxiety.\nTom shakes his head slowly. \u201cI was wishing that I had met you earlier. For both our sakes.\u201d\n\u201cI know why you wish you could have met me, but what would the acquittance have given you?\u201d\nTom sighs and moves his hand in the prearranged signal that will tell his house-elf, Amanda, that he wants the smallest possible breakfast she can be persuaded to make. There\u2019s a long pause before the sausages, scrambled eggs, and toast with several different kinds of jam and marmalade appear on the table. It will be hard to please Amanda after this, probably for days.\nHarry sits down at Tom\u2019s large dining room table when Tom mentions for him to do so, but doesn\u2019t take his eyes from his face. \u201cWell?\u201d he prods, gently, for a certain definition of gently.\n\u201cI would have had someone who was capable of understanding me,\u201d Tom admits. \u201cSomeone who would have believed me when I said I didn\u2019t make Horcruxes, and someone to give me a goal to grow towards.\u201d\n\u201cOther people don\u2019t believe you about the Horcruxes?\u201d\n\u201cFlamel questioned me closely to make sure I\u2019d left that ambition completely behind, but in the end, he did believe me. Dumbledore couldn\u2019t be convinced. I think he passed on his suspicions to Minerva McGonagall, from the way she looks at me whenever I have occasion to visit Hogwarts.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t consider whether you\u2019d made them before you told me.\u201d\n\u201cLiar,\u201d Tom says mildly, blowing across the surface of his tea. It\u2019s delicious, not that he expects anything else from Amanda.\n\u201cNo, really,\u201d Harry says, studying Tom until Tom uses his fork to point to Harry\u2019s own plate. Harry sighs and takes more sausages than Tom will. Tom makes a mental note to ask Amanda for more meat in their meals from now on. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d made them because you behave as if you were sane. I mean, when you\u2019re not rushing around asking complete strangers to please marry you.\u201d\nTom shakes his head and spreads orange marmalade across a piece of toast. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t think I\u2019d made Horcruxes.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I was more worried about your possible other resemblances to Voldemort than that one. And what do you mean, give you a goal to grow towards?\u201d\n\u201cOnly now,\u201d Tom says, slowly pulling the words out of his mouth and stomach like the sticky marmalade, \u201cdo I realize how stagnant I had grown. I had ceased to do anything but watch for the next enemy or political power play, and do what I must to destroy them or maintain my position. But I had no real ambition anymore. I was bored.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll grow more bored when the years pass and I\u2019m physically older than you are?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be immortal with me. So, no, I doubt it.\u201d\n\u201cImmortal with you, is it?\u201d\n\u201cThe Philosopher\u2019s Stone is a means of eternal life that can be shared, unlike a Horcrux. Although, who knows, you might be immortal all on your own. You survived something your world\u2019s Ministry for Magic thought was a certain death sentence.\u201d\nHarry seems to stop breathing for a second. Then he shakes his head and says, \u201cHow would they know if there were other worlds on the far side of the Veil, if no one ever came back to tell them?\u201d\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Tom cocks his head at Harry. \u201cI thought you told me your secrets last night. But not the one about possible immortality?\u201d\nHarry coughs and plays with his fork. Tom hides his smile behind a cup of tea. He thinks Harry thought he might back off once he\u2019d supposedly revealed all his secrets. Tom can\u2019t imagine finding Harry less than fascinating, no matter how much he knows about him, but he\u2019s not surprised there are secrets remaining.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand it myself,\u201d Harry admits finally. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when I\u2019m sure I do.\u201d\nTom lets it go. Even if Harry never agrees to drink the Elixir of Life, they have decades, maybe a century, ahead of them, with Harry\u2019s young physical age. He can wait and have this argument over and over again, as many times as necessary.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I do need to go to work today,\u201d Tom says at last, when he\u2019s read through the Oracle and listened to Harry sigh about every article. \u201cA meeting between the Department Heads is happening, and I need to catch up on my Aurors and the investigation into the one of them that cursed me.\u201d\n\u201cIt was one of your own people?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice rises a little. \u201cAnd they\u2019re still running around alive?\u201d\n\u201cShe, in this case.\u201d Tom has to smile at Harry\u2019s righteous indignation. \u201cI suspect I know what her motives are, but I can\u2019t make an Auror disappear or die without too many questions. And I didn\u2019t want to prolong the investigation when I could be meeting you.\u201d\n\u201cFucking Aurors,\u201d Harry says. \u201cI won\u2019t be going with you to the Ministry.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to,\u201d Tom says, with a little shrug. \u201cI encourage you to use the Floo to talk to my agent about a house you would like to buy, however.\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute. How many houses do you own?\u201d\n\u201cSeven,\u201d Tom says blandly, enjoying the way that Harry\u2019s eyes widen in outrage. \u201cBeing Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement doesn\u2019t pay that well, my dear. I own the houses and rent them out to afford such necessities as breakfast at the Crystal Swan and robes at Glamoursall\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you get them, though?\u201d\n\u201cWon them in duels,\u201d Tom says smugly, and can\u2019t help the way that he smiles when Harry laughs in delight. \u201cIn three cases, I rent them to the families who originally lived there and owned them. That way, they can pretend that nothing is wrong and their status hasn\u2019t changed, while of course still paying me.\u201d\n\u201cAre all of them purebloods?\u201d\n\u201cAll the people I won the houses from, yes. I only duel for the best. Not all of the people living in them. What do I care for people\u2019s blood status, as long as they can pay me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to duel you.\u201d\nTom feels a stirring in his pants and tamps down his instincts with difficulty, smiling a little. \u201cI would like that as well. Perhaps this evening, when I return from the Ministry and you have chosen a house?\u201d\n\u201cI mean\u2014I don\u2019t have anything like a house to give you if I lose.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Tom says. \u201cI would value the practice, however. I\u2019ve never dueled someone as powerful as I am, and haven\u2019t fought at all in more than a year. The Aurors\u2014\u201d Harry grimaces and flinches, which makes Tom wonder what he can do to help with that \u201c\u2014make sure I am well-protected.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m as powerful as you are.\u201d\nTom sighs. \u201cAllow me to be a good judge of personal power levels, Harry. I would have chosen you for that reason aside, never mind all the rest.\u201d\n\u201cMy soul, and my Parseltongue?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but every trait added makes you more perfect. Even you being a half-blood who grew up in the Muggle world. I couldn\u2019t have found someone who truly understood me in a pureblood who\u2019d never set foot there.\u201d\nHarry doesn\u2019t bridle or bristle as Tom was afraid he might. He eyes Tom instead, then nods slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever feel as deeply for you as you do for me,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry to be putting it like that, but it\u2019s true.\u201d\nTom simply smiles at him. \u201cI take statements like that as a challenge, Harry. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m committed to wooing you as long as necessary.\u201d He stands up and looks for a moment at his gleaming golden watch, the kind of accessory that people expect the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement to wear. \u201cMy agent\u2019s name is Deborah Harmon, and her Floo\u2019s name is Harmon\u2019s Harmonious Homes. I\u2019d wait until nine to Floo her, however. She won\u2019t be awake yet.\u201d\n\u201cWill she accept that I\u2019m\u2014who you say I am?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve already owled her,\u201d Tom says, waving a hand. \u201cLast night before I went to bed.\u201d Harry went earlier than he did, which Tom understands perfectly. He was worn out emotionally from everything he told Tom last night, and he slept badly the night before.\n\u201cYou already thought I would want a house?\u201d\n\u201cWe did discuss that, Harry.\u201d Tom raises an eyebrow at him. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a little late to decide that you don\u2019t trust me now, when you\u2019ve already spilled so many secrets to me and had me make an Unbreakable Vow.\u201d\nHarry swallows what looks like it might be an angry retort. Then he nods slowly. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d\nTom smiles at him and touches Harry\u2019s hand where it lies on the table. \u201cStay at the table as long as you like. If you want more breakfast, ask Amanda. She would be thrilled to make something more complicated for you than I asked for today.\u201d\nThe air sparkles near them, which means Amanda is listening. Tom ignores it. She thinks she\u2019s subtle, and if she wants to think so, Tom will allow it. He spends a lot of time figuring out how to keep the people near him happy and content without showing that he\u2019s doing so, so they\u2019ll work harder on pleasing him.\nWith Harry, though, it has to be the real thing, or nothing. Which is part of what makes this whole entanglement with Harry so fascinating and difficult.\nBut Tom would have it no other way.\n\u201cHave a good day,\u201d Tom says, and departs for the Apparition point outside the front door, feeling and ignoring his reluctance to leave Harry behind. Someday, perhaps they\u2019ll spend the nights over at each other\u2019s houses on a regular basis, or live in the same one. Someday, perhaps, Harry can overcome his fear of the Ministry and accompany him.\nSomeday, perhaps Tom will hold another job, one that Harry can join him in.\nTom pauses with his hand on the doorknob. That is a new thought, and one that he would have rejected a week ago without further pondering. He fought for his position as Department Head. He wants to hold onto it.\nWhen it bored you? When you felt limited in it?\nFrowning, Tom opens the door and Apparates to work, while still entertaining the new thought.\n*\nHarry spends some time sitting at the table, eating the extra scrambled eggs and toast that Amanda made for him when he asked, and wonders what Deborah Harmon will really say when Harry Floos her.\nHe isn\u2019t as comfortable as Riddle is with assuming that everyone in his life will just adapt to Harry being there. On the other hand, no, he isn\u2019t about to leave Riddle behind. Not when he\u2019s bound to him by the Unbreakable Vow, and Riddle\u2019s knowing and accepting who Harry really is, what world he came from.\nNot when Riddle has made it virtually impossible for himself to betray Harry.\nBy the time that it\u2019s just after nine and Harry casts Floo powder into the fire, calling out, \u201cHarmon\u2019s Harmonious Homes!\u201d, he\u2019s smiling.\nThe fire turns purple quickly, which makes Harry snatch up his wand, even though he doesn\u2019t think an attack could be coming through the flames. But they turn to regular green in the next moment, and a woman\u2019s cool voice says, \u201cWho are you and how can I help you?\u201d\nDeborah Harmon is a witch with long, mostly grey hair, and eyes that watch Harry like she\u2019s an eagle thinking about clawing his vitals apart. Harry likes her, though. She doesn\u2019t look at him like he\u2019s pitiable, but like he might be dangerous.\nThat\u2019s better. Harry definitely doesn\u2019t want to go back to the way that his Ministry treated him in his former world, with people hating him all the time for no real reason, but some respect is nice.\nBecause he can resist the Imperius Curse. Because he can cast an especially powerful Patronus, even with a wand that hates him. Because he can do things like unravel a powerful wizard\u2019s Parselmouth wards without ever having done it before.\nHe deserves some respect.\n\u201cMy name is Harry,\u201d Harry says. He thinks about adding his last name, but he wants to keep that private for right now, just in case there are other Potters that Riddle hasn\u2019t mentioned. \u201cI\u2019m staying with Tom Riddle. He said he owled you.\u201d\nHe keeps his voice calm, not cringing the way he might have said it yesterday. He trusted Riddle with his deepest secrets. He can trust him to have spoken the truth about a damn owl.\nHarmon\u2019s face relaxes, and she nods. \u201cHe said you might Floo me. You\u2019re interested in looking at houses?\u201d\n\u201cYes. But not some giant place like this.\u201d Harry waves his hand around. \u201cI think Riddle is mental for wanting to live in this huge place all by himself.\u201d\nHarmon blinks, studying him. Harry stares back. He can end the Floo call if this goes badly. He\u2019s sure that Riddle will back him up.\nYes, he really is sure.\nHarry is smiling to himself when Harmon says, \u201cI believe you will be good for him.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? He has a shortage of people in his life who talk back to him?\u201d\n\u201cYes, actually.\u201d Harmon studies him again. \u201cAnd he has never let anyone stay over in his house in all the years I\u2019ve known him.\u201d\nHarry ducks his head so that his pleased smile won\u2019t show too much, and shrugs. \u201cAll right. This is the first time. But I do want my own place. Could I visit some of those houses?\u201d He has no idea how this sort of thing works. He found his little room here because Jenkins introduced him to the owner, and the flat he rented in Diagon Alley through someone Mr. Weasley knew.\n\u201cYes. I will be happy to escort you myself.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to take you away from your work, ma\u2019am\u2014\u201d\nHarmon waves her hand. \u201cI have a shortage of business today, and I want to encourage anything that will ensure Tom Riddle remains human. Come through the Floo, and I\u2019ll get my cloak and escort you around the available properties.\u201d She moves back, and the flames change to purple again.\nHarry takes a deep breath. This could be one of the differences between the worlds, he supposes. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s taken a Floo in the magical world here since he arrived.\nHe steps through, wondering all the while what she meant by \u201censuring Tom Riddle remains human.\u201d\n*\nTom nods to the people who nod to him as he makes his way towards his office in the back of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. This time, he notices more than usual who sneers behind their smile, who is pathetically eager to greet him in hopes of getting ahead, how many people lie with their eyes and their bodies.\nHe enjoyed that, once, didn\u2019t he? The memory feels faded and old when Tom touches it within his own mind.\nYes, of course he enjoyed that. It\u2019s one of the reasons that he aimed for a position as political as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. It\u2014pleased him, once. Perhaps it hasn\u2019t for a while now, but Tom wasn\u2019t conscious of actual dissatisfaction, as such, until he met Harry.\nHarry is honest, painfully so. His emotions blaze across his face, and Tom wouldn\u2019t need Legilimency to know when he\u2019s lying. And although it took an Unbreakable Vow, he trusted Tom with the deepest secrets of his soul. Tom intends for Harry to trust him with more in the future, including this possible secret of his immortality and his body.\nCompared to Harry, the others seem weak and unchallenging. Dishonest, in a pathetic way.\nTom goes to his office and deals with paperwork for the next few hours, until Isabelle Yaxley sticks her head around the door. She gives him a thin smile. \u201cCan I bother you, sir?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Tom puts his paperwork aside. He is still interested in why Lucinda Travers cursed him, and what she intends to do next, and who was using her, and why his own investigation, cursory though it was, uncovered nothing. \u201cPlease, sit down.\u201d\nYaxley nods and shuts the door behind her, but remains standing. She does that often, as if she thinks that the difference in rank between them should never be forgotten. \u201cWell, sir, I have to admit that I was surprised by what I discovered when I checked Lucinda\u2019s background.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that, Auror Yaxley?\u201d\nYaxley blows air through her parted lips. \u201cShe has had no contact with anyone who could have controlled her, not that I could find. She doesn\u2019t owe anyone money, and she hasn\u2019t taken large sums of it lately. And the Imperius Curse theory went up like a firework. It turns out that she\u2019s one of those people who has such an extreme reaction to it\u2014they tested her in the Auror Academy\u2014that she basically acts like a giggling fool. You would have known at once if she was under it.\u201d\nTom frowns and leans back to consider that. \u201cWhat motivation did she have to curse me, then?\u201d\n\u201cNone that I could find, sir.\u201d\nTom swears softly, his mind on Travers. She hasn\u2019t acted unusually at all, that\u2019s true, except for cursing him and then promptly volunteering the spell that would find the person most compatible with his magic and soul. Perhaps she did simply want to become important to him, and assumed that she would do so by bringing in the compatible person? Perhaps she didn\u2019t foresee Harry becoming so important to Tom or desiring anonymity, and thought Tom\u2019s gratitude would go to the person who suggested the spell?\nIt\u2019s a tenuous theory, one that would have relied on her attempting to predict Tom\u2019s actions in a way that she\u2019s never tried to do in the past, but it\u2019s the best Tom has. Because, after all, she has to be the one who cursed him. She was\u2014\nTom doesn\u2019t allow himself to react, keeping his head half-bowed, but his whirling thoughts have jerked to a halt.\nShe was one of two people with him when the Sleepless Soul Curse struck him.\nThe other person stands in front of him.\nWhy did he automatically assume it could not have been Yaxley? Because he trusts her. Because he thought she was loyal to him and the good of the country.\nBecause she speaks the right words and makes the right gestures. Because she seems so calm and motherly all the time.\nBecause Travers is loud and impatient and too quick to fling out a curse instead of speaking diplomatically when the situation calls for it. None of which are crimes.\nIt was Travers and Yaxley, working together last year, who subdued the assassin who came after him, that one who could walk through walls. Except it was Travers, wasn\u2019t it? Yaxley was taken out of the battle early on with a leg wound.\nOne that, when treated later at St. Mungo\u2019s, turned out to have been shallow and not all that serious. Tom attributed Yaxley\u2019s poor performance in the battle to shock at having been wounded at all\u2014it\u2019s not something that often happens to an experienced field Auror\u2014and blood loss. And later, he always thought of it as Travers and Yaxley having saved his life, not Travers by herself.\nEven though that is what occurred.\nTom looks up, and smiles a little. \u201cWell done, Isabelle,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cCursing me in the back like that and doing it so skillfully that I never even suspected you, even though plenty of things about the other suspect\u2019s behavior made no sense. Even though Travers has never had any skill in lying.\u201d\nYaxley\u2019s eyes widen minutely. \u201cWhat are you talking about, sir?\u201d\n\u201cWell done,\u201d Tom repeats, but his rage is rising. He could have died under that curse if Travers had not happened to know the counter. He suspects Yaxley thought no one did, or she would not have risked the kind of spell that did have a counter.\nHe remembers how fiercely Yaxley protected Harry\u2019s anonymity. Because Harry asked for it, Tom thought, but also because Yaxley didn\u2019t want Tom to unite with someone who complemented his soul and might give him a fresh perspective on life and a new direction. More ambition.\nTom\u2019s mind jumps to something else: the cup of tea that Yaxley has brought him on a regular basis for the last year.\n\u201cWhat was in the tea?\u201d he breathes. \u201cNot a love potion, I know that.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not making any sense, sir,\u201d Yaxley says gently. \u201cWould you like to sit down for a while? You might not be completely recovered from the curse Lucinda used on you.\u201d\nTom hates himself for considering that for one moment. Then he shakes it off. Yaxley is good at manipulation, but he still thinks she had help.\n\u201cA Wit-Dulling Draught, then,\u201d Tom decides. It\u2019s the only thing that makes sense, and while it can\u2019t account for his long lack of interest in his job or his boredom with the world overall, it does account for things like him not immediately suspecting Yaxley and feeling increasingly detached from life.\n\u201cThat\u2019s an obscure potion, sir.\u201d\n\u201cThe Sleepless Soul Curse is obscure, too.\u201d Tom points his wand at her. \u201cYou might as well confess, Isabelle. Or, if you\u2019re truly innocent, let me look into your mind, and that will prove it better than any Veritaserum will.\u201d\nYaxley\u2019s wand leaps into her hand, and she casts a spiraling, spreading red wave of a spell that Tom banishes, but barely. He\u2019s never seen that spell, either, and cold fear works out through him as though someone is spinning a web through his chest.\n\u201cIf you could have died, that would have been better,\u201d Yaxley says softly, working her way to the left, around his desk. Tom turns steadily to face her, keeping his hand on his wand. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know a coma was a probable result of the curse. And of course I couldn\u2019t disagree with Lucinda when she trotted out that spell. Interfering bitch.\u201d\nA day ago, Tom would have laughed if someone had told him that Yaxley would ever swear. How long has he simply accepted that she was loyal without actions to prove it? He wants to shake his past self.\n\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re immortal. That\u2019s too long for one person to hold a position like yours. Or even just decades, until you really got bored with it, would be too long. The Ministry needs new change, new blood. We need to bring in people who hold the position for a time, not forever.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I suppose you think you would make a wonderful Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, trusted as you are?\u201d\nShe would, is the thing. Or the woman Tom thought she was would. How long has Yaxley been weaving her subtle way into being trusted?\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to discuss me,\u201d Yaxley says. \u201cBut I do want to see your face when I cast the Sleepless Soul Curse on you again.\u201d She smiles. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to shield against it, do you?\u201d\nIn fact, Tom does not. But he laughs in her face. \u201cWhat was undone once by a spell, can be undone again by the same spell.\u201d\nYaxley laughs back at him. \u201cIf you\u2019re cursed a second time, only the exact same person can raise you from the coma, not just any person who\u2019s compatible with you. And I\u2019ll be taking care of that little problem after we\u2019re done here. Anima insomnis!\u201d\nTom tries to dodge, since he can\u2019t shield, but the curse is too big, a spreading wave of blue that once again wraps him in the dark cocoon, hearing but motionless. As he crashes to the floor, terror and rage devour him.\nRage for his situation. Terror for Harry.\nAnd Yaxley\u2019s laughter.\n\u201cHarry? Are you all right?\u201d\nHarmon has been visibly uncomfortable without a last name to call him by, but Harry just ignored that, and it\u2019s been working well so far. They\u2019ve looked at some beautiful homes, including some that were too big for Harry, and now Harmon is showing him a small cottage that might do, on the edge of Hogsmeade. It has quiet blue rooms and a Floo whose default state is to be shut, which Harry favors.\nAnd now he has a headache. One that seems deeper than any he\u2019s ever had before, as if it\u2019s coming from inside his brain. One that\u2019s localized\u2014\nRight in his scar.\nHarry straightens up. Harmon, who was coming towards him with her hand out, takes a step back, dark eyes studying him carefully. Her wand, a length of ash wood, is in her hand but aimed at the wall, not at him.\n\u201cI think Riddle\u2019s in trouble,\u201d Harry blurts.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harmon blinks and lowers her wand further. \u201cHow could you possibly know, Mr.\u2014Harry?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Harry hesitates, wondering what to tell her, but then it comes to him. \u201cBut you know about that spell I saved him from, right? The one that would have kept him in a coma forever if I hadn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cI did not know that was you. The papers did not announce your name.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it was me,\u201d Harry snaps. \u201cAnd it left some kind of connection between us, I think.\u201d It\u2019s as good an explanation as any, and it might even be true. \u201cNow I\u2019m feeling an ache in my head, the exact same kind of thing I felt when the spell connected us.\u201d That part is bollocks, but Harry isn\u2019t about to explain Horcruxes and curse scars and soul-connections that might come from them. \u201cI feel\u2014\u201d\nFrantic, that\u2019s what he feels. As if a beast inside him so tame that he\u2019s never felt it stir before is now awake and scratching at his ribs with claws.\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Harmon finally tucks her wand away and looks around for the Floo powder that brought them here. \u201cI will take you to the Ministry.\u201d\nHarry swallows, feeling sick. Can he help Riddle if he\u2019s incapacitated simply walking into the place where Riddle might be lying helpless?\nHe might be at St. Mungo\u2019s instead, Harry thinks, and kind of hopes Riddle is, so he won\u2019t be shaking like a fool when he walks into the building. The spell to wake him up should be simple, shouldn\u2019t it? The same one Travers cast last time.\nHarry pauses.\n\nHow did I know that he\u2019s been hit with the Sleepless Soul Curse again? \n\nBefore he can do anything else, Riddle\u2019s fear and rage overwhelm him. Harry digs his hands into the side of the fireplace to remain standing. Harmon utters a quick distressed sound and comes towards him.\n\u201cMr\u2014Harry, are you all right?\u201d\n\u201cI need,\u201d Harry says, swallowing and making his decision in a rush of his own fear that Riddle being afraid is not a good thing, \u201cyou to take me to Hogwarts.\u201d\nHarmon\u2019s eyes widen, but maybe because he told her Riddle was in danger, she nods and reaches out to grasp his arm. Then they both have to leave the cottage to use the Apparition spot because of the anti-Apparition spells on the building, but that\u2019s all right. It allows Harry some time to come to terms with his decision.\nHe knows very well why the chestnut wand hates him. He knows how lucky he was to find one that worked in the Knockturn Alley wand shop at all, and he knows that if he went to Ollivander\u2019s, all of them would have rejected him at first touch, even the holly one if it exists in this world.\nThey can all sense that only one wand will work for him, and it\u2019s not them. His holly wand in his old world served him well enough, but then, it had been repaired by his real one, hadn\u2019t it?\nHarry has no idea what\u2019s going to happen as they appear outside the gates of Hogwarts, but just the way he knew Riddle has been stuck with the Sleepless Soul Curse again, he knows to lift his hand.\nThere\u2019s a shrill, piercing whistle, which reminds Harry of phoenix song if someone managed to speed it up the way Muggle music sometimes is. Then a window shatters high on the side of the castle wall, and a slender shape speeds towards Harry, tumbling end over end and singing like a demon.\nHarry grimaces as he clasps it. He expects it to sting him, or be hot, or otherwise exact some kind of punishment for his ignoring it for so long.\nBut it doesn\u2019t. Instead, the minute Harry touches the Elder Wand, the demon\u2019s song gets into his head and become a song of mad joy, and power rushes through his body as though it\u2019s springing up from ashes.\nThe chestnut wand in his pocket bursts asunder. Harry is glad that the cloth of his new robes is thick enough that that didn\u2019t hurt him, at least. He shakes out the splinters and turns to Harmon, who\u2019s staring at him with round eyes.\n\u201cCan you get me to the Ministry entrance, quickly?\u201d\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Harmon looks back and forth between his wand hand and the splinters of his old wand on the ground.\nHarry curbs his impatience. Telling her that it would take too long to explain will probably lead to her folding her arms and demanding an explanation anyway, and that will take up time they could be using to get to Tom.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t wield my chestnut wand very well because I had already been claimed by this wand,\u201d he says, swinging his right hand. The Elder Wand showers sparks in response, making Harmon take a wary step back. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want to take it up because another person thought he was the rightful wielder. Now I have it, and now I can save Tom. Will you please take me to the Ministry entrance?\u201d Harry would do it himself, but he doesn\u2019t know if it looks like the one in his old world or not.\nHarmon holds out her arm, but murmurs, as he clasps it, \u201cI will want a full explanation at a later date.\u201d\n\u201cIf Tom says I can give it to you, then I will.\u201d\nHarmon scowls at him as they Disapparate, but Harry hardly notices. He\u2019s mentally preparing himself to march into the Ministry again, which isn\u2019t the same as the one at home, but looks an awful lot like it.\nThe Elder Wand warms and thrums in his hand, and a deep voice speaks directly to Harry in the silence of his mind.\n\nThere is nothing we cannot do.\n\nHarry tightens his hold on the wand and hopes it\u2019s right. There\u2019s no telling what sort of trouble Riddle\u2019s got himself into this time.\n*\n\u201cHello!\u201d\nHarry looks up sharply. He\u2019s keeping strict control of himself, and he and Harmon got through the Atrium and to the lifts all right. But seeing an Auror hurrying towards him makes him raise his wand, tensing for battle.\nThen he recognizes her, and relaxes. It\u2019s Auror Yaxley, the one who was so nice to him when the Aurors came to Jenkins\u2019s shop and managed to make him relax when they were escorting him through the Ministry. Harry trusts her as much as he can trust anyone in those scarlet robes.\n\u201cAre you here because of Mr. Riddle?\u201d Yaxley asks, looking between Harry and Harmon. She looks more curiously at Harmon, probably because she doesn\u2019t recognize her.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard something about him, then?\u201d Harry keeps his voice low, his hand on the Elder Wand positioned as if tucked casually into a pocket in his robes. If they haven\u2019t started spreading the word that Riddle\u2019s had something happen to him yet, then Harry doesn\u2019t want to do it and perhaps cause a panic.\nYaxley nods, her lips pursed. \u201cYes. I think he\u2019s been cursed again, but I\u2019m no expert on the conditions caused by such curses\u2026\u201d\nShe\u2019s talking about something else, but Harry is distracted. The Elder Wand is trembling in his robe pocket, and the rising, ringing growl in Harry\u2019s head sounds like that of a tiger getting ready to eat some prey.\n\nShe is our enemy.\n\nHarry sighs. He assumes his own paranoia about Aurors has infected the Elder Wand. He hasn\u2019t heard of that kind of thing happening before, but then again, no one should be able to have the allegiance of a Deathly Hallow transfer across worlds. No one should be able to survive a trip through the Veil.\nNo, she was nice to me before, Harry responds to the wand, pushing hard with his thoughts. He has no idea whether it can actually hear him, or whether the communication flows only one way. He doesn\u2019t know anything about this. The only thing he\u2019s experienced at is saving people, and he\u2019ll do that if people will get out of the way!\n\nShe hurt your mate.\n\nHarry frowns and glances at Yaxley, who seems to have noticed that he\u2019s not paying attention. She gives him a faint smile. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about Mr. Riddle, aren\u2019t you? Don\u2019t worry, he recovered from this curse once before. I think that he\u2019ll do the same thing once we get you back to his side.\u201d\nHarry narrows his eyes as the lift finally comes and he and Harmon and Yaxley all pile into it. \u201cIt\u2019s the same curse from before? The Sleepless Soul Curse?\u201d\n\u201cAs far as I can tell,\u201d Yaxley says. \u201cI\u2019m not actually sure what spell Auror Travers cast to locate you or when you were in the same room with Mr. Riddle, but I\u2019m sure that we can find her and make her tell us.\u201d\n\u201cMake her?\u201d Harmon asks sharply, before Harry can.\nYaxley hesitates, then sighs. \u201cFor the past few days, Mr. Riddle has been having me investigate Auror Travers. She was with him when he was cursed the first time, and it was interesting that she happened to know the countercurse to a spell as obscure as the Sleepless Soul. I haven\u2019t found anything yet, but there\u2019s no guarantee that that there isn\u2019t something there, buried deep. I\u2019m not as skilled an investigator as Mr. Riddle is.\u201d\nHarry actually can\u2019t hear the next question Harmon asks, although he sees her mouth moving, because the Elder Wand\u2019s voice is everywhere, filling his ears, clouding his hearing.\nShe lies! She is the one who cast the curse!\nHarry does his best to hold his face as carefully still and neutral as possible. Even if the wand is right\u2014and he can\u2019t believe that\u2019s a sentence he\u2019s thinking to himself\u2014he can\u2019t do anything while they\u2019re in the lift. He\u2019ll have to wait until they arrive at a place with some open space where he can move. He fights best when he can run and dodge.\nThe lift reaches the floor for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and Harmon steps off first. Harry angles himself a little to the side as he follows, trying to make sure that Yaxley doesn\u2019t have a clear shot at his back.\nIf the wand is right, which Harry has to admit is a big if. But then again, there\u2019s no sense in letting an Auror get too close to him, even if she was one who was all right\u2014or acted all right\u2014before.\n\u201cWhere is Mr. Riddle?\u201d Harmon asks, looking around the wide office of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Harry does, too, trying not to let his breathing get too fast and shallow. This is just an office, he reminds himself sternly, it can\u2019t actually attack him or anything like that.\nThe Elder Wand twists and growls in his pocket, the growls seemingly reassurances about what they can do if someone does try to attack him, but Harry can\u2019t actually hear words this time.\n\u201cThis way,\u201d Yaxley says, and walks towards the back of the large office.\nIt occurs to Harry that it\u2019s very quiet. There should be more people around than the trainees he can see here and there, looking at things through magnifying lenses or practicing charms. He wonders for a second if everyone is gathered around Tom and paying attention to him.\nThat could be the truth. But as he hears a soft thump and whirls around to see Harmon lying Stunned on the floor, Harry doesn\u2019t think it is.\nBefore the Elder Wand is even fully out of his pocket, a shield has formed in front of him, catching the Cutting Curse that Yaxley\u2019s sent at him. Harry watches it fade away, and then watches her.\nYaxley studies him with a frown, and sighs. \u201cNo one reported any dueling skill in your past,\u201d she says, and shakes her head. \u201cBut then again, you\u2019re extraordinarily hard to track down. No record of OWLS or NEWTS that I could find, either.\u201d She spins her wand casually in her hand.\nHarry glances around, but all the trainees are ignoring them, and then he sees the shimmer of a ward that must be masking their actions and words. He turns to face Yaxley as she begins to circle to the left.\nHarry steps along with her, making sure that he knows where Harmon\u2019s body is so he won\u2019t step on or trip over her. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to kill me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal,\u201d Yaxley says, and she sounds reassuring. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we need an immortal man like Tom Riddle out of office, and we need to bring in people who can shake up the Ministry, not keep it stagnant. And you\u2019re the only one who can wake him up from the Sleepless Soul Curse now. So you have to go. Dolor!\u201d\nThe Elder Wand raises a shield against the pain curse, too. Harry can feel it trembling with eagerness in his hand, wanting to cast something else, but he doesn\u2019t want to kill Yaxley. So nothing lethal.\n\u201cSo you have a little skill at dueling,\u201d Yaxley says, not sounding surprised, although her head cocks like a bird\u2019s for a second. \u201cCor glaciei!\u201d\nHarry feels a brief, tight, cold pressure around his heart. Then it breaks apart in a shower of sparks as the Elder Wand reaches into his chest and casts a shield inside him. Which is\u2014not something he really wants to experience again.\nFight her!\nHarry takes a deep breath and sets his sights on Yaxley. No, he doesn\u2019t want to kill her, not when he thinks Riddle is going to want her alive to answer questions. But there are plenty of spells he can use that won\u2019t do that. And he has to shed his feeling that if he just stays quiet and plays along with what an Auror wants, that they won\u2019t hurt him.\nThat was proven wrong when they threw him through the Veil.\n\u201cConfringo!\u201d Harry casts on the nearest desk, but Yaxley dodges the explosion, although a shard of wood catches her on the hand and skins it open. She immediately casts back at him, a spell Harry has never seen before that collects her blood into a barbed chain and makes it lash out, trying to entangle his legs.\n\u201cAguamenti!\u201d Harry says, not knowing at first where the impulse to use that charm comes from. But the water slams into her chain and makes the blood back into liquid, flowing over the floor.\nYaxley\u2019s eyes are bright as she laughs. Then she casts another silent spell at him, one that conjures whirling balls of light that look like Bludgers, which stream towards Harry\u2014and slam straight through the shield he\u2019s raised.\nHarry wasn\u2019t a Seeker once for nothing. He dodges and rolls, using the half-broken desk as shelter. The balls of light slam into it, and Harry sends a Jellylegs Jinx at Yaxley from under the desk.\nYaxley snorts as she removes it. \u201cIs that something you truly expected to stop me? I\u2014\u201d\nIt was a good distraction, is what it was. And Harry thinks Yaxley likes running her mouth too much. He surfaces from behind the desk and yells, loudly enough that it might cut through the ward she\u2019s raised around them, \u201cEXPECTO PATRONUM!\u201d\nThe air around them seems to grow bright and still for a second. Harry has enough time to worry that the spell won\u2019t work with the Elder Wand for some reason before it trembles and gushes silver mist, a brilliant stag emerging.\nOne bigger and more solid than any stag that Harry\u2019s ever summoned, too. It lowers its antlers as it charges and seizes the astonished Yaxley on the tips, tossing its head to throw her across the room.\nThat carries her through the ward and finally gets the trainees\u2019 attention. But since they all gape like fish for the amount of time it takes Yaxley to rise to her feet, they\u2019re no help. One of them does start shouting, but Harry is too busy paying attention to Yaxley to be sure about what they\u2019re saying.\n\u201cFinite Incantatem! Frangere!!\u201d And Yaxley casts after that, although silently, her wand weaving in a familiar enough pattern.\nProngs leaps into the path of the first two spells, not fading until what Harry thinks is the Breaking Curse is gone. And as for the last one, the Imperius Curse\u2014\nHarry lets himself stand there and permits it to wash over him. He smiles a little internally as he watches Yaxley stumble towards him, murmuring what sound like reassurances to the trainees.\n\u201cYou are to go into Riddle\u2019s office and kill him,\u201d Yaxley says quietly when she\u2019s close enough to be inside the ward again, and thus keep her voice away from the trainees\u2019 ears.\nHarry nods as if emptily agreeing, and then trains his wand on her and Disarms her. Yaxley is still staring when Harry casts a sharp, vicious Stunner that, amplified by the power of the Elder Wand, knocks Yaxley into what looks like a coma.\nGood, Harry thinks, for the moment as vicious as his wand. Serves her right for what she did to Tom. \nHe looks up to find the trainees all still staring, and sighs. \u201cShe\u2019s cursed Mr. Riddle,\u201d he says, when one of them tentatively starts to draw his wand. \u201cIf you want to do something to help, make sure that she doesn\u2019t wake.\u201d\nIn the meantime, Harry gestures his Patronus into being again, and says, \u201cTake this message to Lucinda Travers: Tom Riddle has been cursed again with the Sleepless Soul. I need to know the spell that wakes him. From the one with green eyes.\u201d\nProngs scrapes his hoof against the floor and bows his antlers before turning and vanishing from sight. Harry turns and strides down the corridor towards what must be Riddle\u2019s office door.\nNo one tries to stop him.\n*\nTom is straining impatiently against the blindness that covers the eyes and the darkness that holds him motionless when he hears a whisper of a spell. He immediately goes still. If Yaxley is in the room, Tom doesn\u2019t want to alert her that he has some awareness, even as limited as it is.\nAnd then\u2014\nThen the music pours into his soul again.\nTom reaches out and grasps it this time, yanking it close to him. He hears a startled gasp, and redoubles his hold, until he feels something touch his skin. It feels like a hand, clasping and opening nervously on his arm.\nTom pours the music of his own soul into Harry\u2019s, and this time, the flashes of memories he sees make more sense. Well, not the one of a wand flying towards Harry through a window on a tower that looks suspiciously like one at Hogwarts, but Tom isn\u2019t going to question that.\nNow. He will ask all sorts of questions later, of course. But right now his delight at having Harry by his side again overcomes even his curiosity over what Harry has been doing in the past few hours.\nHarry trembles against Tom, and then relaxes in a surprising way. Tom pauses for a second, but Harry\u2019s soul sings reassuringly to him, and he goes back to drinking it in.\nSomehow, things are all right. Maybe Harry managed to avoid Yaxley, or defeat her. What matters is that he is here, and Tom will never let him go again. He has made decisions during what might have been the hours that he lay there helpless and listening.\nHe opens his eyes, and Harry smiles at him. From behind Harry\u2019s shoulder, Lucinda Travers gives Tom an anxious nod, which reminds Tom of some apologies that he will need to make for suspecting her.\nBut he doesn\u2019t want to make them now. \u201cAuror Travers,\u201d he says, \u201cwill you please give us some privacy?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, sir,\u201d Lucinda murmurs, bowing her head. \u201cI am glad to see you well and not dead.\u201d\nHarry snorts a little as she goes out the door. \u201cNo wonder you suspected her at first. She\u2019s kind of blunt, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\u201cI should have known that she wouldn\u2019t have the subtlety to pull off what happened to me, though.\u201d Tom can\u2019t take his hands from Harry, or his attention from the clear-eyed look and smile Harry is offering him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cI think I felt it when you were cursed. My scar started aching, and it felt as if something had started hurting inside my skull, too.\u201d Harry rubs one thumb over the skin behind Tom\u2019s ear, still staring at him in a pleasant but confusing way. \u201cSo I asked Harmon to take me to Hogwarts.\u201d\n\u201cTo Hogwarts?\u201d Tom asks, feeling his face go blanker than it\u2019s probably ever been. \u201cDid you think I was there?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Harry licks his lips. \u201cI knew that if you were in trouble, I\u2019d probably need a wand that worked for me.\u201d He hesitates, and then takes out a wand from his pocket and lays it on the desk beside Tom. Someone must have moved him there, but he felt no hands, so perhaps it was Lucinda or Harry with a spell.\nThe first thing Tom sees when he turns to the wand is that it isn\u2019t the chestnut one Harry has been carrying. He doesn\u2019t recognize the wood that it\u2019s made of, though. He frowns and reaches out towards it, but Harry catches his wrist.\n\u201cUm. It\u2019s kind of temperamental right now. It\u2019s irritated that I took so long to pick it up.\u201d\nTom leans as subtly into Harry\u2019s hold as he can, still beyond thrilled that Harry is touching him of his own free will. He doesn\u2019t know what brought on the change, but it\u2019s welcome. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\n\u201cIt speaks to me.\u201d\nTom snaps his head back and stares at Harry\u2019s face, but he doesn\u2019t look sick or delusional. \u201cYou hear it?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Harry ducks his head as though he\u2019s embarrassed about something. \u201cIt\u2019s the Elder Wand, Rid\u2014Tom.\u201d\nHearing his first name from Harry\u2019s mouth makes Tom reach up and trace Harry\u2019s lips for a moment. Harry continues gazing at him with wide, bright eyes, not backing away.\nAnd then the words he said really catch up to Tom. He jerks back sharply and turns to stare at the wand, which vibrates and rolls in a circle. Tom isn\u2019t sure if that\u2019s smugness or a warning not to pick it up. Maybe both\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n\u201cUm. I said it\u2019s the Elder Wand.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you wielding a Deathly Hallow?\u201d\n\u201cI kind of\u2014united them in my first world.\u201d Harry ducks his head further and shrugs when Tom stares at him in shock. \u201cI had no idea they would follow me across worlds.\u201d\nAnd that makes Tom\u2019s Legilimency twist in the way that means someone is lying, Tom rolls his eyes and lifts Harry\u2019s face so he can look him in the eyes again. \u201cYou knew. Why didn\u2019t you go and claim the Elder Wand the moment you arrived in this world?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s shoulders tense, and he shrugs a little. \u201cIt was one of the reasons I got arrested by my first Ministry. They wanted to use the wand, or maybe they wanted to experiment on it and create Elder Wands for all their people. Different Aurors said different things, and so did the Unspeakables who came and talked to me. I didn\u2019t want the same thing to happen here. I don\u2019t want to be the center of public attention, Tom.\u201d\nThe current of deep unhappiness in his voice makes the decision Tom was pondering for him. But rather than talk about it yet, he runs a hand down Harry\u2019s shoulder and murmurs, \u201cBut you took it up now?\u201d\n\u201cYes. For you.\u201d\n\nNot for himself. \n\nTom suspects that is the important difference for Harry, and probably always will be. He doesn\u2019t say anything about that, either. He touches Harry\u2019s cheek and says, \u201cThen I am content. But won\u2019t the Elder Wand\u2019s prior wielder come looking for it?\u201d\n\u201cUm. Yes. Probably. It\u2019s Dumbledore. That\u2019s the wand he took from Grindelwald when they dueled.\u201d\nTom just stares. Then he throws his head back and laughs.\n\u201cAre you okay, Tom? Not worried about getting in trouble with Dumbledore?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tom says, still laughing, but managing to stop it when he sees how wide Harry\u2019s eyes are. \u201cJust picturing Dumbledore\u2019s face when he finds out.\u201d He reaches out and grips Harry\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou dueled Yaxley?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and Stunned her. Auror Travers confirmed that they have her in a holding cell now and that her wand was snapped.\u201d\n\u201cDid you do that?\u201d\n\u201cI stepped on something that broke under my foot earlier, when I went out to meet Auror Travers. I don\u2019t know what it was.\u201d\nHarry looks so innocent that Tom wants to kiss him. He manages to restrain the impulse, and asks the question that is the most important. \u201cWhy is your attitude so different towards me now than it was yesterday?\u201d\nHarry takes a deep breath. \u201cBecause I felt your pain when you were attacked. In my scar, sure, but in my head and\u2014and soul too. And then just now, when our souls connected for the spell, I heard the song of yours, too.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t occur to Tom that Harry wouldn\u2019t have shared the earlier song from the other spell. But then again, it was Lucinda who cast that spell, not Harry. Perhaps that made the difference.\nTom blinks. \u201cAnd\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly why you\u2019re so obsessed with me, so devoted, but I saw that you were,\u201d Harry admits quietly. \u201cAnd I reckon that I can trust you even without the Unbreakable Vow.\u201d\nThere\u2019s still vulnerability in the eyes that meet Tom\u2019s, but power thrums through Harry\u2019s words that has nothing to do with the Elder Wand. Tom leans forwards and lets his lips brush over Harry\u2019s, not even thinking through the action before he does it.\nHarry gasps once, and then his hands grasp the back of Tom\u2019s head, and he kisses him back.\nIt is the best kiss of Tom\u2019s life, and even though it\u2019s also the shortest, with Harry breaking away with flushed cheeks, it doesn\u2019t matter. He basks in the sensation while Harry calls Lucinda back into the room.\nHis hand brushes against the Elder Wand briefly, and it snarls at him\u2014he hears it in his head, too\u2014and stings him. Tom retracts it swiftly, and Harry gives him a sheepish smile and picks up the wand that is, indeed, temperamental.\n\u201cSorry about that,\u201d he says.\n\u201cDo not apologize,\u201d Tom says. \u201cYou do not understand how much I\u2014wish to be with you.\u201d Those words will stand in for all the things that he can\u2019t express at the moment.\nAs Harry smiles at him and Lucinda enters, Tom knows he wants to see that smile every day of his life.\nWhich means not being the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement anymore.\nThe contentment that swamps him as he thinks about that only strengthens his conviction that he has made the right decision.\n\u201cI will be stepping down as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.\u201d\nHarry stares at the man he\u2019s given up on calling Riddle even in his head now, his mouth a little open. They\u2019re at the front of the large office with all the desks, and Tom said he had some kind of official announcement to make. But Harry never imagined that this would be it.\nTom\u2019s head is turned, his eyes crinkled in amusement as he watches Harry\u2019s reaction. And Harry can\u2019t even yelp and ask questions the way he wants to, because they\u2019re in public. He has to stand there and smile and act as if he saw this coming all along.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAt least someone is voicing the comment that Harry wanted to make. It\u2019s Auror Travers, who has wide eyes and her wand raised as if she wants to make a more emphatic point than just using her hand.\n\u201cBut that just gives the people behind Yaxley what they want!\u201d Travers complains. \u201cWhy would you do that, sir?\u201d\n\u201cThey can think of it as winning if they want,\u201d Tom says mildly. This close, Harry can feel the moment when his muscles tense under his robes. \u201cIf they try to come after me again, they will learn that I am not so easily defeated.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone got hit by the Sleepless Soul Curse twice,\u201d Harry murmurs under his breath. He doesn\u2019t think anyone will notice the Parseltongue. Other people are waving their wands or their hands frantically, and paying far more attention to their own noise and the noise of other people than to him.\n\u201cAnd someone was freed,\u201d Tom hisses. He doesn\u2019t keep his Parseltongue quiet at all. Bastard.\nHarry tilts his head back to meet Tom\u2019s gaze square-on, and feels a sharp jolt of excitement of the kind that he probably hasn\u2019t felt since Voldemort was defeated. Tom has to always have a challenge or a fucking test for him to pass, of course. He\u2019s made his commitment clear to Harry in public, even if no one else ever knows why he\u2019s stepping down.\nVery well. Harry can make a similar one to him.\n\u201cYou speak as if our strength was the same,\u201d he hisses, and hears some of the people who were shouting gasp and shut up. Travers is staring at Harry as if she\u2019s never seen him before. A few of the trainees shuffle behind their desks and suddenly look glad that they\u2019re at the edges of the crowd.\n\u201cI speak as if our strength were joined. Because it is.\u201d\n\u201cNot as thoroughly as it will be in a little while.\u201d\nAnd Harry gets his revenge for Tom springing this surprise on him in public without even trying. Tom exhales sharply, and a blush makes its way down his ears and neck. He coughs and turns back to their audience.\n\u201cWhy, sir?\u201d Travers demands, the first to recover. \u201cWhy are you giving up a job you excel at, for the sake of a\u2014a stranger you just met?\u201d She gives Harry a look of dislike, which Harry returns serenely. It\u2019s fine for her not to like him. That doesn\u2019t make her evil.\nHe intends to take the lesson Auror Yaxley taught him to heart.\n\u201cBecause I am bored,\u201d Tom says. \u201cAnd detached from justice, more and more. You need someone as the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement who is passionate about the job, or at least committed to remaining connected to the world.\u201d He draws Harry close to his side with one arm around his shoulders. \u201cAnd because I have a new challenge, something else I am passionately committed to.\u201d\nHarry flushes in turn, and sees Tom\u2019s eyes crinkle again.\nYes, it\u2019s hard to be embarrassed in public, but for the sight of Tom smiling like that, he would endure it over and over again.\n*\n\u201cMay I say one thing before I go, Mr. Riddle?\u201d\nTom turns around with a polite smile. Deborah Harmon came along to Tom\u2019s house with them, of course, since she can Floo home from there, and Tom does feel he owes her a debt for being with Harry when he fought Yaxley, taking a Stunner that she certainly wouldn\u2019t have taken if not for that involvement, and Apparating Harry to Hogwarts. But Tom doesn\u2019t want to wait much longer before he goes up the stairs. Harry has already given him a long look and walked up, and Tom is certain that he\u2019s heading for the bedroom Tom means for them to share.\n\u201cOf course, Deborah.\u201d\n\u201cI am glad that you have him,\u201d Deborah says. \u201cAnd glad that he has persuaded you to leave a job that you were increasingly ill-suited for.\u201d\nTom feels his smile become a bit more fixed. \u201cHarry didn\u2019t persuade me. I\u2019m sure you saw his face. He was as surprised as everyone else.\u201d\n\u201cThere is such a thing as indirect persuasion.\u201d Deborah studies him again with sharp eyes. \u201cAnd the time that I saw you kill that Dark wizard who had decided to target my business for some reason\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe wanted to buy your building and you turned him down.\u201d\n\u201cHe still had an extreme reaction that I will never understand.\u201d Deborah shrugs. \u201cI was and remain grateful for that protection. But you smiled at the moment as if you had more in common with a dragon than a human.\u201d\n\u201cYou think Harry will keep me human?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already smiled more in the last half-hour than I\u2019ve seen since I met you.\u201d\nTom wants to object that he smiles plenty, and especially at someone like Deborah, who has proven herself useful and never annoying, until now. But he restricts himself to a polite inclination of his head. \u201cIf you say so. And I\u2019m sure that Harry will want to retain your services in a few days. He\u2019ll still want a house of his own.\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t share yours?\u201d\nThat speculation goes beyond the boundary of Tom\u2019s ability to tolerate. No one else needs to be thinking about Harry sharing his bed, not in any kind of detail. \u201cYou forget yourself,\u201d he says coolly.\nDeborah pales, and half-bows. \u201cAll right. Then I\u2019ll let myself out, Mr. Riddle. Thank you for the use of your Floo.\u201d\nTom watches her go, only heading up the stairs when he hears the rush of the Floo igniting. He frowns as he does so, wondering what would have happened to him if he\u2019d never met Harry.\nWould he have become obsessed with proving himself against some enemy, the way he thinks Deborah was insinuating? Or would he have simply withered away without noticing, caught in the stale stagnation of routine, until he became a mere figurehead in the job?\nTom dismisses the thought. He doesn\u2019t need to worry about that, because he did meet Harry.\nAnd Harry is waiting for him upstairs.\n*\nHarry pulls off his shirt and glasses the minute he enters Tom\u2019s bedroom, which means it takes him a minute to gape around at the walls, because the shirt momentarily blocks his view. But then, he can see, and even without his glasses, it\u2019s worth looking at.\nHoly shit, Tom. Magpie, much?\nThe walls are the same deep blue as the swatches of cloth decorating Glamoursall\u2019s, or nearly. Soft silver stars and golden planets stud them, and Harry wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find they\u2019re made of real precious metals. The floor is a soft dark carpet that nearly rises to Harry\u2019s ankles, and makes a gentle crushing sound beneath him as he walks. An enormous cupboard dominates the far wall, and a huge desk with a mirror the wall next to the bathroom door, both of them made of ebony wood that ripples with faint reflections of Harry\u2019s movements.\nBut the bed dominates the room itself.\nHarry lets his hand rest on the blue coverlets, shaking his head. The bed looks like a pool, it\u2019s so covered with shiny blue sheets, with the panoply of pillows at the head white like foam and the heavy blanket at the bottom a dark green. Harry lowers himself to sit on the mattress, and groans at the softness.\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d\nHarry smiles up at Tom as he enters the room, pretending that his heart isn\u2019t beating fast enough to make him dizzy. \u201cOf course. Tell me, did you get the idea for the color from Glamoursall\u2019s?\u201d\nTom narrows his eyes as his hands go to work on the buttons of his robe. His eyes are scanning Harry\u2019s chest, and Harry\u2019s sure that he\u2019s cataloguing every single scar and patch of skin. His gaze isn\u2019t angry, however, but starving.\nHarry shivers, and reaches down to slide off his shoes and trousers.\n\u201cI have always liked this color, Harry.\u201d Tom\u2019s voice has deepened a little, and it makes Harry\u2019s cock stir. \u201cI charmed the walls this color long before I ever went to Glamoursall\u2019s. It has only been open for a few years.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the stars and planets? I suppose you\u2019re going to tell me that you came up with that idea on your own?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not. The basic picture has been in my head since I first attended a meal in the Great Hall of Hogwarts beneath the charmed ceiling.\u201d\n\u201cBut you admit you copied it from somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cThe truly important thing that will be happening in this room in a few minutes will be unique.\u201d\nHarry licks his lips. He\u2019s still nervous, but from the way that his cock is bobbing up softly, that\u2019s not going to affect his arousal. His hands hesitate on either side of his pants when he realizes that Tom is completely naked and standing up. Far from acting as if he\u2019s nervous himself in front of Harry, he basks in the attention, turning slightly from side to side.\nOf course Tom is tall and well-muscled, and his hair shines with that intriguing mixture of dark and silver. But Harry\u2019s attention goes to his cock, standing upright, dark red with blood, looking hard enough to potentially hurt.\nOn the other hand, Harry thinks about sitting on that cock, and his hips flex without his permission.\nTom smiles. \u201cWe will go as slowly as you need, Harry. But I would very much like to see you naked.\u201d\nHarry has to smile back at the last word, which in Parseltongue comes out as close to \u201cnewly shed of scales.\u201d He hopes Tom won\u2019t be disappointed as he pulls down his pants and drops them on the floor next to his shoes and trousers.\nTom\u2019s attention grows so sharp that it could very well cut someone who wasn\u2019t expecting it. He moves forwards until his knees are pressed against Harry\u2019s. Harry leans back on the bed, reaching up to cradle Tom\u2019s elbows with his hands.\nTom follows him down, and kisses him in a long, sensual, expert way that makes Harry\u2019s head spin and a short, strangled noise emerge from his throat. He wriggles under Tom and spreads his legs, suddenly eager in a way he never expected to be.\nThen again, he thinks he was only half-alive during the last few years.\n\u201cHarry.\u201d Tom breaks off, looking startled. \u201cI had intended for us to have sex, but not for me to penetrate you the first time.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Harry says. \u201cSo the mighty Slytherin is scared.\u201d\nTom\u2019s eyes flash with annoyance. \u201cI do not want to hurt you. I never want to hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cBut you want to fuck me,\u201d Harry says, and watches in satisfaction as that blush starts down Tom\u2019s ears and neck again\u2014and goes much further than that, now that he can see everything. \u201cYou\u2019re not holding back because you want to do something else. You\u2019re holding back because you think I\u2019m a scared, little, trembling, na\u00efve virgin.\u201d He sighs and reaches out to the bedside table where he put his wand. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll have to do it myself, then.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tom croaks, his eyes flitting back and forth between the Elder Wand and Harry\u2019s body.\n\u201cFuck myself with the wand.\u201d The Elder Wand makes a questioning little noise, but it will do what he wants, always, Harry knows. He starts to position it at the right distance from his hole.\nTom grabs his wrist. \u201cYou are not.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then.\u201d Harry ducks his head and looks up at Tom from beneath lowered lashes. \u201cI think you should get on with it.\u201d\nTom holds his wrist for a moment longer, careful not to touch the Elder Wand with his bare skin. Then he flings his head back and laughs like a hyena. Harry smiles and lets Tom guide his hand to the side table again, dropping the Elder Wand when Tom squeezes again (even though the wand makes a disappointed little noise in his head).\n\u201cYes,\u201d Tom says. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I do want to fuck you. But I thought it would be too overwhelming for you at first.\u201d\n\u201cHow many other overwhelming things have I survived?\u201d\n\u201cI want you to do more than survive this, Harry.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure I will,\u201d Harry says, smiling a little as a distant echo of prophecy flits through his head. \u201cCome on, then. Show me what the high and mighty Slytherin can do.\u201d\n*\nTom uses far more lubrication and preparation charms than he ever has before, but he\u2019s determined that Harry will have no cause to regret this in the morning, even if the cause of that regret would only be a sore arse. Then he slides a pillow under Harry and lifts his hips up.\n\u201cYou\u2019re ready?\u201d he whispers, swirling his fingers gently in the oil that\u2019s coating Harry\u2019s arse and the bottom of his legs at the moment.\nHarry smiles at him and wriggles a little closer, nearly undoing Tom\u2019s work with the pillow. \u201cYes. Please.\u201d\nTom is glad that he never made any remarks about Harry begging him for it or anything like that, because he would have hated to miss this moment (and Harry would have done all he could to avoid begging as a point of pride, Tom is sure). He works Harry open with his fingers first, and Harry sighs, his eyelashes fluttering, body relaxing.\nWhen it comes time to enter him, Tom does it slowly, in a long slide. Harry\u2019s breathing seems to stop at one point, and Tom looks up sharply to find Harry with his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\n\u201cYou\u2019re all right?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I am,\u201d Harry says. \u201cJust getting used to it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right. He\u2019s never felt anything like this before, never been with anyone before, man or woman.\n\n\nAnd he\u2019ll never have to worry about being with someone who hurts him.\n\nTom bares his teeth as he finishes sliding into Harry and pauses for a second to let the heat overwhelm him, along with the music of Harry\u2019s soul that begins whispering in his ears again, until he knows he has to move, that they both want him to.\nIt turns out that Harry\u2019s pretty vocal, but not with words. He hooks his legs around Tom\u2019s waist and hisses meaningless sounds at him. He cries out when Tom manages to hit his prostate several times in a row. He likes to have his hands gripped and held down, as much as Tom can do that from his relatively awkward position, encouraging him with moans.\nTom enjoys all of it, committing each sound to memory. He\u2019ll do this in the future, too, figure out how to make Harry make all of them.\nHarry is his, and that includes the sounds he makes.\nIt seems it doesn\u2019t take long until Harry\u2019s back arches and he comes between them with a garbled noise of pleasure and surprise, but then, he\u2019s never had this before. Tom slows his own motions to gentle, languid ones, until Harry shifts beneath him.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to come?\u201d he whispers.\nTom kisses his wrist quickly, hearing the echoes of anxiety in that. Harry might be feeling as though he\u2019s not a good partner if Tom hasn\u2019t come yet. \u201cYes, but first I want to try something.\u201d\n\u201cWh-what?\u201d\nTom concentrates hard on Harry and focuses his magic on him, too, until he thinks he can feel the net of Harry\u2019s nerves and blood humming under his skin. This might not work, but then again, Tom has never had a partner with whom he\u2019s so in tune, and more to the point, he\u2019s never bedded another Parselmouth. If it\u2019s going to work with anyone at all, it will with Harry.\nTom hisses, \u201cCome back,\u201d and pulls on Harry\u2019s nerves and blood at the same time.\nHarry makes a far more garbled noise when his cock hardens a second time. He looks up at Tom with wild, bright eyes, which makes Tom smile. He doesn\u2019t let go of Harry\u2019s hands as he speeds up the motion of his thrusts again.\n\u201cWh-what\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou said that already,\u201d Tom observes, and Harry tries to bite him. That he falls painfully short doesn\u2019t matter, not when he\u2019s already pushing back on Tom with the expression of someone determined to chase his pleasure.\nTom lets himself fall fully into it, the awareness of Harry, the sweat on the skin he caresses and the magic glowing between them and the rising tide of orgasm. Tom thrusts forwards once and holds still as he comes, hissing now, his own back arching, his eyes closing.\nHe doesn\u2019t get to see Harry\u2019s second orgasm, but he can feel it, and that\u2019s all he really needs as the echo rolls back and forth between their souls.\nTom casts Cleaning Charms, afterwards, and lies down on the bed with Harry in his arms. Harry gives him a dazed but suspicious look. Tom smiles. He thinks that\u2019s rapidly going to become one of his favorite expressions on Harry\u2019s face.\n\u201cWhere did you learn to do that?\u201d\n\u201cHere and there,\u201d Tom says. It wouldn\u2019t do to reveal all his secrets at once. He\u2019s playing the long game, playing to keep Harry, and the more he can reveal and lure him in with, the stronger his chances of doing exactly that.\nHarry would probably say that he doesn\u2019t need to do that, that he wants to stay with Tom no matter what, but Tom just thinks of it as insurance. He\u2019ll do all he can, and he\u2019ll do some more.\nBecause Harry woke him up, and nothing is more precious to him.\n*\nHarry stumbled through the Veil, through darkness and cold, his arms windmilling around him. He didn\u2019t see anything or hear anything, but it was only a fall from one place to another, one world to another.\nAs he knew later.\nHarry ended up in a small, dark alley, shivering, his arms wrapped around himself. He stared down at his limbs, thinking that even though they\u2019d only been covered in chains for such a short time, it already looked strange to see himself without them.\nHe looked up and around, but he didn\u2019t recognize the place. He was surrounded by stones and cobbles, which at least indicated he was probably in a magical street. The walls were plain grey, however, and had no doors. Perhaps someplace off Diagon Alley or Knockturn?\nNervous energy jerked Harry to his feet. If the Veil really was a back door from the Ministry somehow, the Aurors could be along any second to fetch him and drag him back into captivity.\nHe stuck his head around the corner of the wall, and jumped. Yes, it looked like Diagon Alley. He recognized Florean Fortescue\u2019s and Madam Malkin\u2019s.\nBut it was filled with people, many more than he remembered seeing on any of his last few trips to Diagon Alley, and they didn\u2019t have the air of people waiting for someone to tell them that the evil Dark Lord Harry Potter had been executed, either. They were all in more colorful robes than usual, they strolled casually and laughed and chatted, and there were loads more children than Harry had seen since he was a child himself. They ran in circles and chased bubbles conjured for them by their parents and laughed merrily when someone else chased them.\n\nWhat is this? \n\nHarry wondered if he was dead and having a delusion somehow, or if this was the afterlife. But he had no idea. He stayed hidden, watching. No one came down the alley, which seemed to lie behind several buildings, and no one seemed to notice him.\nOne witch idly kicked a folded newspaper aside, and it blew towards him. Harry stooped down and picked it up, bracing himself to find a story about Harry Potter on the front page. Hermione had told him that the Prophet was reporting on nothing else.\nBut the title at the top was the Oracle. And there was a logo of a crystal ball with wings like a Snitch\u2019s, definitely something he\u2019d never seen before.\nHarry stared, his eyes skimming over the articles. There was something about Puddlemere United winning a game, Celestina Warbeck announcing that her next concert would be her last one, and\u2014\nHarry\u2019s fingers trembled and went cold. He nearly dropped the paper.\n\nHEADMASTER DUMBLEDORE ANNOUNCES NEW POTIONS PROFESSOR.\n\n\u201cThis is impossible,\u201d Harry whispered. He closed his eyes and summoned his courage, then read through the article. It was exactly what the headline had said it was, with Dumbledore announcing the retirement of Professor Horace Slughorn after a long and distinguished career, and a woman named Rulinda Black becoming the next Potions teacher.\nHarry shook his head, blinked, and shook it again.\nHe didn\u2019t know what this was. He would need more information to confirm it. After all, no one knew what lay on the other side of the Veil. This could be some kind of trick, or a prison worse than Azkaban.\nBut what if it was real? What if this was another world where Dumbledore was alive, and Voldemort had been defeated or killed early on, and no one had ever heard of Harry the Boy-Who-Lived?\nI\u2019ll stay out of things this time, Harry promised himself grimly as he flipped to another page and saw something about the opening of a new joke shop in Hogsmeade, run by George Weasley, Fred Weasley, and Lee Jordan. They have their own lives. No one I knew needs me interrupting. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t need any Aurors\u2014\n\nA sharp shiver ran up Harry\u2019s back, and he swallowed and cast the paper aside, watching as it rolled into the distance.\n\nI don\u2019t need any Aurors deciding that I make an interesting target to stare at and follow around and ask questions.\n\nHarry nodded and turned to walk towards Knockturn Alley, or at least the way it would lie from here in his own world. If he somehow had been granted a second chance, he knew exactly how he would use it.\n\nLie low. Keep my head down. Be content with the simplest and most non-political life I can. I\u2019ve left all dreams of grandeur far behind me.\n\n*\nHarry has to smile, thinking of his dream, as he sits at Tom\u2019s table the next morning, eating more eggs and bacon courtesy of Amanda, and wriggling his arse now and then to feel the pleasurable ache from it.\n\nThat didn\u2019t work out the way I thought.\n\nBut as he looks up at Tom, rolling his eyes over Oracle articles in the chair across from him, Harry wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\nTom\u2019s head swings up, and a second later, Harry\u2019s magic sensitivity warns him. A cloud of light is moving towards them, strong, serene power that he\u2019s never felt this way before, but knows at once.\n\u201cWhat is Albus doing here?\u201d Tom asks, in the kind of light voice he uses when he wants to interrogate someone instead of kill them.\nHarry is a little worried that he recognizes the difference between those tones of voice already, but brushes the thought away. \u201cHe probably wants to know where his wand is, Tom. And he either managed to track it down or learn who has it, finally.\u201d\n\u201cStay here.\u201d\nTom stands up, and Harry blinks at his back for a second before he scrambles after him.\n\u201cWhat are you intending to do?\u201d Harry demands as Tom tries to raise a ward in the middle of the corridor leading to the front door. Harry steps easily through it, the Elder Wand dissipating it without even leaving Harry\u2019s pocket.\n\u201cKeep you safe.\u201d\nHarry knows that tone. It\u2019s the murder tone. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d he says, catching Tom\u2019s arm and forcing Tom to turn and look at him. \u201cDumbledore isn\u2019t a threat.\u201d\n\u201cSays the boy who trusted so much in him last time that you followed his orders and walked straight into a Killing Curse.\u201d\nThose last words are in Parseltongue. Harry sighs and strokes the inside of Tom\u2019s elbow. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the same world,\u201d he breathes. \u201cAnd he isn\u2019t the same man. Just like you aren\u2019t the same man as Voldemort.\u201d\nTom\u2019s nostrils flare for a second. Then he says, \u201cYou may speak to him, but I will be part of the conversation.\u201d\n\u201cYes, oh high and mighty Slytherin,\u201d Harry says, and sees to his delight that the words still have the power to irritate Tom.\n*\nHarry meets Albus a few paces away from the front door.\nTom keeps his word and stands at Harry\u2019s shoulder. But he doesn\u2019t bother lessening the intensity of his glare at Dumbledore. At least since he left Hogwarts, he and Dumbledore haven\u2019t played games with each other about what they feel. Tom hates him; Dumbledore distrusts Tom.\nBut it\u2019s worse now, because Tom knows Dumbledore is a threat, and doesn\u2019t want him anywhere near Harry.\nHarry, of course, walks straight out to meet the Headmaster, because he\u2019s an idiot. And then he takes the Elder Wand from his pocket and holds it casually in one hand. \u201cWelcome, Headmaster,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy did you come?\u201d\nDumbledore is wearing a set of purple robes with gold trim, gaudier but probably cheaper than the blue ones with gold dragons that Harry is wearing. He looks at the wand Harry is holding, and smiles. \u201cMy wand, actually,\u201d he says. \u201cIt left me rather abruptly. I\u2019m glad to see that it\u2019s been safe.\u201d He reaches out.\nTom has no idea what Harry is doing as he seems to practically offer the Elder Wand back to Dumbledore on an open palm. Is that it, then? Is Harry once again backing down in fear from power, from leadership, and condemning himself to inferior service from a wand that will resent him?\nThen Dumbledore\u2019s hand brushes the wand, and he jumps and backs away. \u201cIt\u2014appears to have acquired teeth since I last held it,\u201d he says blankly, holding up his hand. There\u2019s a small, neat hole in his palm, from which blood wells.\nIt only stung me, Tom thinks smugly. But then, Tom touched it accidentally, not trying to steal it.\n\u201cYes, Headmaster,\u201d Harry says, and tucks the Elder Wand back into his robe pocket. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s not going to be yours anymore. It\u2019s chosen a new master, you see.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s pocket stirs angrily, as if he\u2019s stuffed a snake in there, and Tom supposes the Elder Wand doesn\u2019t like the word \u201cmaster.\u201d But there\u2019s also no sign that it\u2019s trying to chew through Harry\u2019s robe or bite him on the leg.\n\u201cHow did that happen?\u201d\nDumbledore still has a trick of peering over his half-moon glasses that irritates Tom to no end, but Harry seems immune to it. He smiles at Tom\u2019s old enemy and shakes his head a little. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s something that has to remain a secret.\u201d\nDumbledore studies him some more. Harry looks back with a polite, blank smile. Tom hovers, ready to descend on Dumbledore in an instant if there\u2019s any sign that he\u2019s using Legilimency on Harry.\nBut he doesn\u2019t. Dumbledore sighs, draws a hawthorn wand from his pocket, and heals the small bite wound on his hand. \u201cI hope that you\u2019ll take care of it, my dear boy. Keep it safe for me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be safe,\u201d Harry says, and his voice and posture are both a little stiffer. \u201cBut not for you.\u201d\nDumbledore pauses again and darts a sharp glance back and forth between Harry and Tom. Then he sighs and seems to give in gracefully\u2014although Tom will be watching out for another attack in the future, given who they\u2019re dealing with. \u201cWell. Of course, many wands have more than one owner over the course of their lifetimes, unless they are buried with their owners.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s smile is a little pained as he nods. Perhaps he\u2019s thinking of the funeral for the Dumbledore in his world, Tom thinks, which Harry told Tom he\u2019d attended. \u201cThat\u2019s true, sir. And it was nice to meet you.\u201d\nDumbledore doesn\u2019t attempt to outstay his welcome, something that surprises Tom. He nods to them both, but lets his gaze linger on Tom only a moment, and offers only the cryptic bit of advice, \u201cSometimes we find what we need where we least thought to look for it.\u201d\nTom snarls under his breath as he watches Dumbledore stroll away. He really does go to the Apparition point and Apparate away. Tom relaxes then, and reaches out and pulls Harry close to him with a hard arm around his shoulders.\n\u201cHe\u2019s really not as bad as you\u2019re making him out to be,\u201d Harry says, and leans his head on Tom\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cNor is he as innocent as you think he is,\u201d Tom mutters. \u201cI think he\u2019ll try some other scheme to get the Elder Wand back.\u201d\nHarry tilts his head a little, then laughs.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tom demands. He knows Harry isn\u2019t laughing at him, but he can\u2019t feel that Harry knows something without immediately wanting to share it. That\u2019s how he\u2019s made.\n\u201cThe Elder Wand is going to drill a hole through Dumbledore\u2019s heart if he does succeed in stealing it.\u201d Harry shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Tom. I don\u2019t particularly want him dead, but I won\u2019t let him have the wand, and I won\u2019t tell him all the secrets I carry, either.\u201d He slides his hand up Tom\u2019s neck to cup his cheek. \u201cThe only person I want to share my secrets with is you.\u201d\nTom picks up Harry\u2019s hand and kisses it. Harry smiles at him, and Tom hears the distant song of their conjoined souls.\nHe thinks about their future. They might travel. They might make magical discoveries. Perhaps they\u2019ll go in search of James Potter and see what he\u2019s up to, whether he met and married Harry\u2019s mother in this world. If there\u2019s another version of him out there, and what they might do if there is.\nBut first\u2026\n\u201cWe never did have our duel.\u201d\n\u201cYes, let\u2019s go!\u201d Harry says, and dashes back into the house, towards the dueling room Tom showed him the first night they spent there. Tom follows at a more sedate pace.\nHe\u2019s already thinking of how he\u2019s going to compensate for Harry\u2019s advantage of having the more powerful wand. And planning on how he\u2019ll make Harry smile when he loses.\n\nPlanning how to make Harry smile.\n\nIf that, rather than travel or magical discoveries, turns out to be Tom\u2019s main purpose on earth for the next hundred years and beyond, he\u2019ll welcome the future with open arms.\n\nThe End.\n"
