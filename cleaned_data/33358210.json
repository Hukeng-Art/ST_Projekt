Personally, I think it\u2019s hilarious either way for different reasons. In the Not Dad for One AU, All for One launches his fake bomb of evidence at the same time that Izuku develops Black Whip. People see a boy with All Might\u2019s quirk and multiple quirks and completely believe that he must be the test tube baby of All Might and All for One. Izuku goes on a troll rampage in retaliation, and by the time the dust clears there are enough conspiracy theories to make Shouto Todoroki weep from joy.</p>\n<p>In the Dad for One AU, All of One can\u2019t convince anyone that he\u2019s Hisashi Midoriya. The Hero Public Safety Commission already released a statement saying that All for One is Izuku\u2019s father and then released another statement taking it back. They\u2019re not going to change their minds again\u2014it would make them look too foolish. The story has been entrenched in the public\u2019s mind as notorious fake news. No one will ever be able to convince Izuku of it because he\u2019ll always believe that All for One is just trolling him back.</p>\n<p>The critical difference between these AUs is a matter of timing. Dad for One tried to keep Izuku\u2019s relationship to him secret until the right time to prevent him from being taken hostage. The non-related All for One could care less so he spews out his fake story immediately. Ironically, this results in people only believing All for One is Izuku\u2019s father in the AU where he isn\u2019t. Izuku, of course, doesn\u2019t believe it whether it\u2019s true or not. That was Izuku\u2019s lie first and he\u2019s very miffed at All for One for trying to steal it.</p>\n<p>I had no plans to continue this fic, but it won a poll on my tumblr (<a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/aimportantdragoncollector\" rel=\"nofollow\">aimportantdragoncollector</a>) for which of my oneshots should get a chapter two. I\u2019m grateful to everyone who loves this cracky story. I refuse to answer any questions about why a oneshots series now has a second chapter. I also refuse to answer any questions about the timeline, this takes place in crackverse.</p>\n<p>Thank you to BucketOfMud and RianMoeru for helping me come up with twitter names, and my sister for brainstorming the plot with me.</p>",
    "text": "The whole mess never would have happened if the hospital hadn\u2019t put Izuku Midoriya on oxycodone.\nAfter a major attack on U.A. by the League of Villains left dozens of students seriously injured, Recovery Girl couldn\u2019t get to all of them fast enough. An overworked nurse added the strongest available painkiller to the IV of the poor green-haired boy with two broken arms.\nIf Inko Midoriya had been present, she would have told them absolutely no oxycodone, because her son had a strange reaction to it, and no one wanted a repeat of the time a six-year-old vigilante had roamed the neighborhood creating net traps to capture a purse snatcher, two underwear thieves, and an overly aggressive dog. Alas, Inko was not consulted until it was far, far too late.\nIzuku opened his eyes. He stared at the white ceiling of the hospital, aka his home away from home. His head spun and his tongue felt dry. He couldn\u2019t move his arms. A tingling covered his body. Euphoria raced through his veins, bringing with it a drug-induced sense of confidence and a craving for chaos and destruction.\n\u201cAll for One sucks,\u201d Izuku said.\n\u201cCommand not recognized,\u201d his phone replied. The same kind nurse who\u2019d give Izuku oxycodone had also enabled voice commands on his phone so the patient with the broken arms could at least have some entertainment.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tell the whole world how much All for One sucks.\u201d Izuku was riding high on the self-righteous fury of a young hero who\u2019d seen the people he cared about hurt by the League of Villains. He was also just plain high. \u201cGonna tweet about it.\u201d\n\u201cOpening twitter,\u201d the phone said. \u201cYou are not logged into twitter. Would you like to enter a username and password or create a new account?\u201d\n\u201cCreate a new account. I\u2019m going to call it \u2018Awful for One.\u2019\u201d Izuku giggled. In his floaty state of mind, this seemed absolutely hilarious.\nBy the time Izuku stopped laughing and babbling nonsense, he dimly registered a mechanical voice saying, \u201cYour new account has been created. What would you like to tweet?\u201d\n\u201cSend tweet: I\u2019m All for One! I want to rule Japan, but I can\u2019t fasten a tie!\u201d Izuku laughed even harder.\n\u201cTweet sent.\u201d\n\u201cTell them\u2026tell them I\u2019m an overgrown chuunibyou who loves monologuing\u2026\u201d Izuku frowned. Even in his inebriated state, this didn\u2019t seem quite cutting enough. \u201cNo, wait. Cancel that tweet.\u201d\n\u201cTweet deleted.\u201d\nIzuku knew he could come up with something better. Something all the more vicious for being true. His thoughts soared at hyperactive speed. \u201cI\u2019m highly disappointed in the performance of the League of Villains today. What kind of lame ass clowns attack a school full of children and get their asses kicked? Particularly embarrassing was how the League of Villains got in each other\u2019s way, culminating when Tomura decayed a wall onto\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCharacter limited reached.\u201d\nIzuku blinked owlishly. He desperately needed to scratch his nose, but his arms wouldn\u2019t move. \u201cSend what you have to Tomura Shigaraki, then.\u201d\n\u201cTweet sent tagging Tomura Shigaraki, account name DecayHands.\u201d\n\u201cStart new tweet. Critique of League of Villains Performance, 1/5. Tomura had the single worst performance today. When he decayed a wall onto Mr. Compress and Twice, he turned the tide of battle in favor of the heroes. Maybe he should go seek employment at U.A.\u201d\n\u201cTweet sent.\u201d\n\u201c2/5. Dabi chased his younger brother around like a headless chicken until he walked straight into a trap laid by Izuku Midoriya, who was clearly the only intelligent person on the battlefield that day.\u201d\n\u201cTweet sent.\u201d\n\u201c3/5. Toga dedicated herself to creeping on students she found attractive rather than fighting, and Twice\u2019s pitifully obvious puppy crush led him to cover for her mistakes. Tell them both to play kissy face on their own time.\u201d\n\u201cTweet sent.\u201d\n\u201c4/5. Mr. Compress\u2019 trench coat got in the way of his fighting and he needs to acquire some trick besides turning people into marbles. He doesn\u2019t have as much talent in his whole body as his great-great-grandfather had in his pinky.\u201d Izuku was especially proud of that last insult because it sounded like something an immortal supervillain would say.\n\u201cTweet sent.\u201d\n\u201c5/5. Spinner was completely fucking useless. I don\u2019t know why we keep him around. I\u2019d call him comic relief except he\u2019s not funny.\u201d\n\u201cTweet sent. You have received a reply to your tweet. DecayHands says, \u2018Sensei, I understand that you\u2019re disappointed in us, but please don\u2019t air the dirty laundry publicly.\u2019 You have received a reply to your tweet. IHateEndeavor says, \u2018Shiggy you moron, it\u2019s a troll account. Ignore it.\u2019\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s eyes shot open. They doubted the verity of his account, did they? He knew how to prove himself! \u201cReply to DecayHands: Would a fake know that I instructed you to obtain One for All from the current nineth holder?\u201d\n\u201cYou have received a reply to your tweet. DecayHands says, \u2018It really is Sensei! I\u2019m sorry for disappointing you! I\u2019ll do anything to make it up to you!\u2019\u201d\nAnything, eh? Izuku\u2019s smile widened. \u201cReply to DecayHands: Your fashion sense is a disgrace. What are you going for, goth NEET? Next battle, I want you to wear\u2014\u201d Izuku\u2019s brain short-circuited as he tried to think of the ugliest possible villain costume on the fly. He\u2019d always been told his own fashion sense wasn\u2019t the best. \u201c\u2014surprise me. Model yourself after a combination of Wash and Minoru Mineta but more even more purple.\u201d\n\u201cTweet sent.\u201d\n\u201cReply: From now on, you must obey Izuku Midoriya as you would me because\u2014\u201d Izuku\u2019s painkiller-hazed mind strained. Because he\u2019s awesome didn\u2019t seem like a very plausible explanation. \u201cBecause he\u2019s my long-lost son.\u201d Brilliant!\n\u201cTweet sent.\u201d\nIzuku was on a high (quite literally). He just knew he could top himself. It would only take one more push. \u201cI would like to confess my love to Doctor Kyudai Garaki, the beloved of my immortal life.\u201d Perfect!\n\u201cYou have reached five thousand, eight hundred, and six followers. Would you like to follow any of them back?\u201d\nIzuku laughed so hard he passed out.\nAll Might stared at his computer screen with horror. Nezu had forwarded a link to a twitter account with a simple question mark. All Might would like to believe it was all a prank, but only All for One would know about One for All.\nWith shaking hands, All Might emailed the Hero Public Safety Commission that he believed this account genuinely belonged to All for One.\nThen he headed to the library to look up books on how to talk to children about villainous parents. After such a devastating public reveal, young Midoriya would require all his support!\nThe League of Villains was in a state of disarray. Spinner curled up in a ball in the corner, muttering, \u201cAll for One thinks I\u2019m useless\u2026\u201d\nToga spun her knife. \u201cHow dare he try to restrict my pursuit of my dreams?\u201d\nDabi stood over them, shouting, \u201cIt\u2019s not real! The account is clearly fake! What\u2019s wrong with all of you?\u201d\nMr. Compress shook his head sadly. \u201cIt must be real, because his analysis of my performance today was spot on. I need to go practice some more.\u201d\nTwice said, \u201cI think the account is real,\u201d followed by, \u201cHa! That thing is faker than a porn star\u2019s breasts!\u201d\nTomura ignored all of it, because he knew the truth. No one besides Sensei would know about One for All. He added a giant diaper and a washing machine to his amazon shopping cart, hoping he was along the right track for his new costume. He had a new little brother, so he needed to look good for the next family reunion.\nIt looked like the family might get even bigger soon, too. Dr. Garaki? A strange choice for love, but Tomura just wanted his sensei to be happy.\nYawning, Izuku stretched his arms. Recovery Girl had come by to heal him while he\u2019d been asleep, how nice. His phone buzzed.\nLooking over, Izuku saw that he had over three million notifications.\nThe events of yesterday rushed back in an opioid-blurred haze. Had he randomly decided to pretend to be All for One\u2019s son? And Tomura Shigaraki had brought it?\nAs he scrolled through his new troll twitter account, his heart rate kept accelerating. Twitter had verified the account as belonging to All for One? The Hero Public Safety Commission had issued a statement asking civilians not to follow the account while they filed a suit to get it deleted? The request had clearly backfired on them: Izuku had several million followers. The count rose even as he watched it.\nHis finger trembled over settings, about to delete this account before anyone ever found out what he\u2019d done.\n\u201cPsst! Nineth!\u201d The ghostly figure of the First One for All user waved at him. Yoichi Shigaraki flickered in and out of existence. \u201cCan you see me? We\u2019re still working out the kinks of how to manifest when you\u2019re awake.\u201d\n\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhh! First!\u201d Izuku dropped his phone. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about what I did, I was high on painkillers, it will never happen again! I\u2019m about to delete the account!\u201d\n\u201cYou are?\u201d Yoichi tilted his head, frowning. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. I came to give you tips on how to make it look even more real.\u201d\nThe painkillers were out of Izuku\u2019s system at this point. He had no excuse for what he said next. \u201cThat does sound like fun.\u201d\nIn the waiting room for those about to be released from the hospital, Shouto Todoroki scrolled on his phone. A long hiss emerged from his mouth.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tenya asked, looking over his shoulder.\n\u201cAll for One has a new twitter account!\u201d Shouto pointed with a shaking finger. \u201cIzuku is his long-lost son! This ruins several of my favorite conspiracies. Unless\u2026do you think there\u2019s any chance All for One and All Might had a test tube baby?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Katsuki stomped over. \u201cNo, Hisashi Midoriya isn\u2019t All for One, I\u2019ve met the man! Gimmee that.\u201d He snatched Shouto\u2019s phone. \u201cDammit, that\u2019s fucking Deku tweeting!\u201d\n\u201cBut twitter verified the account as belonging to All for One,\u201d Tenya protested. \u201cIzuku would never pretend to be someone else. He\u2019s far too honorable.\u201d\nKatsuki snorted. \u201cYou\u2019ve only ever known his good boy side. You don\u2019t know what he\u2019s like when he snaps. Did someone in this shitty hospital give him oxycodone? I swear, we\u2019ll be lucky if he doesn\u2019t burn this whole building down if he\u2019s on oxycodone.\u201d\nShouto muttered, \u201cI need to update my conspiracy theorist blog.\u201d\n\u201cCool down.\u201d Katsuki rolled his eyes. \u201cJust wait, after the painkillers wear off, the shit nerd will delete the account and this will all blow over.\u201d\nYoichi hovered over Izuku\u2019s bed. \u201cBefore we start the good stuff, let\u2019s add some more content to make this look convincing. Old twenty-first century memes. But no good memes for my brother. Stupid memes! Google \u2018Be Friend with Stupid People, Feel Like Genius All the Time.\u2019 Yes, the bad grammar is deliberate.\u201d\n\u201cOoo, that one is perfect for the All for One and the League of Villains.\u201d Izuku laughed as he edited the image to show a picture of the league as the \u201cstupid people.\u201d\n\u201cNext up: \u2018Working on my five year plan. 1. ? 2. ? 3. ? 4. ? 5. And then they\u2019ll all be sorry.\u2019\u201d\nBanjo popped up next to Yoichi. \u201cAre we embarrassing All for One? Can I tell the story about the time his shoe got stuck on an escalator?\u201d\nYoichi shook his head. \u201cI would love to tell that story, but we need to make this account look real, and he\u2019d never willingly tell that to the public. I\u2019ve been dictating to Izuku the story of the time he stole the Hero Public Safety Commission\u2019s experimental quirk-enhancing serum.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t that story make him look good, though?\u201d Banjo asked.\n\u201cNot after I explain how the serum gave him permanent baldness and hemorrhoids.\u201d\n\u201cBut it didn\u2019t\u2026oh!\u201d Banjo said with enlightenment.\nIzuku typed rapidly. \u201cThis will embarrass the Hero Public Safety Commission, too. I love it.\u201d\n\u201cAll this is just the appetizer.\u201d Yoichi steepled his fingers. \u201cNow for the main course. Dictate: \u2018I\u2019ve been pining lately for a colleague of mine. That domelike head, the cute goggles, the majestic whiskers\u2019\u2026\u201d\nIzuku hesitated. \u201cThe Dr. Garaki love confession was one of my less convincing lies. Are you sure this won\u2019t expose us?\u201d\n\u201cWe only need to convince one person. And that won\u2019t be hard. People believe what they want to believe, and I\u2019ve seen how that creepy doctor looks at my brother.\u201d Yoichi\u2019s grin became diabolical. \u201cNext tweet: \u2018My desire grows stronger with every day, but I fear disrupting our working relationship as colleagues. If you\u2019re reading this, and you don\u2019t return my feelings, then we can pretend this never happened. But if you feel the same way, then give me a signal. A sign. Sneak up behind me while we\u2019re at work, take me into your adorable potato arms, and kiss me like we\u2019re both still twenty.\u201d\n\u201cI see what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Banjo hummed. \u201cIf we can just pull it off, I\u2019ll be satisfied for the rest of my unlife.\u201d\nAs Izuku posted his latest tweet, Yoichi cackled maniacally. \u201cHa! This will teach you to stick me in a bank vault, big brother!\u201d\nEven Izuku couldn\u2019t help shuddering. Note to self: Never piss the First off.\nDr. Garaki\u2019s heart rate accelerated as All for One entered his laboratory. He lowered his face to his desk to hide his blush.\nAt first, Dr. Garaki hadn\u2019t believed the new twitter account could be real. But then it had filled with stories of the past, stories that no one alive knew except for himself and All for One. Dr. Garaki concluded that the outward absurdity of the account had all been to disguise a secret message meant for exactly one person. The only other person who would understand those old secrets and memes.\nLately, All for One had been a tad short with Dr. Garaki, even asking him to \u201cstop staring so creepily.\u201d But Dr. Garaki completely understood why\u2014his employer must be impatiently waiting for an answer to his confession.\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t as if Dr. Garaki had never thought about it. The master was an exceptionally handsome man. But after suppressing his feelings so long, it was difficult to work up the nerve.\nDr. Garaki\u2019s breathing came out rougher.\n\u201cHow should we troll Tomura?\u201d Izuku asked, tapping his chin. \u201cI thought about giving more scathing critiques, but I\u2019m concerned that he might learn something from them.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s embarrass him,\u201d Yoichi said.\nNana appeared. \u201cThat\u2019s my job! I\u2019m a grandmother\u2014I exist to embarrass that boy. Toshi has been looking through old records of Tomura\u2019s childhood before that bastard All for One appeared.\u201d Her face pinched. \u201cThere\u2019s loads of great humiliation material.\u201d\n\u201cReady when you are,\u201d Izuku said.\nNana began, \u201cWhen my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Tomura was a cute little four year old, he wanted to marry the family dog Mon-chan when he grew up\u2014\u201d\nAs Izuku typed, he thought, Note to self: Also never piss Nana off.\nIzuku didn\u2019t know why All Might had asked for a private talk in the teacher\u2019s lounge. He understood even less why All Might had expressed constant concerns for his health throughout the day. He\u2019d been cleared for release from the hospital, the same as everyone else.\nHis mentor stood with his hands behind his back in front of a huge stack of books. They had titles like A History of Discrimination Against Quirks Labeled as Villainous and How to Have Difficult Conversations with Your Child.\nIn a faltering voice, All Might asked, \u201cYoung Midoriya, have you seen the twitter account Awful for One?\u201d\n\u201cThat? I thought it was funny. Did you not think it was funny?\u201d Izuku wondered if he was about to get in trouble for what he\u2019d done.\nAll Might bit his lip. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve yet seen what he said about you, but I want you to know what whether he\u2019s lying or not, it makes no difference to me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Izuku paled as he realized the meaning behind his mentor\u2019s words. \u201cYou think that\u2019s real? I created that twitter account as a joke! I was trolling Tomura!\u201d\nAll Might sagged into his seat. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I never meant to trick you, too.\u201d Izuku waved his hands. He bounced back and forth with nervous energy.\nAll Might ran a hand down his face. \u201cTomura believes that it\u2019s real? Am I understanding that correctly?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been having so much fun embarrassing him.\u201d\n\u201cYoung Midoriya, did it ever occur to you to lead Tomura into a police trap?\u201d\n\u201cOhhhhhhhhhhhhh,\u201d Izuku said.\nTomura did not know what to make of his sensei\u2019s instructions to summon the League of Villains to a picnic in an industrial park. It all seemed very random. But Sensei had been firm that everyone show up and that he must bring mochi.\nHopefully, Tomura would have a chance to ask Sensei to stop telling those stories about his childhood online. The leader clearly thought they were cute, but they were making the rest of the League of Villains give Tomura funny looks.\nThe food was already spread out at the park, but All for One hadn\u2019t yet arrived. The League of Villains sampled the picnic, barely noticing how they became drowsier with each bite. They had all fallen unconscious when the police arrived to pick them up.\nStanding among the tanks of Nomu, All for One wondered where the hell Tomura and the rest of his minions had gotten off to. He\u2019d been meaning to talk to the boy about his new costume. All for One tried to let his student make his own choices and mistakes. But that monstrosity was a step too far.\nDistracted in his thoughts, All for One didn\u2019t notice Dr. Garaki sneaking up behind him.\nA horrified scream echoed through the night.\nOMAKE TIME!\nOmake: Nezu Knows All\nNezu: I suspect this twitter account is false. Awful for One, can you offer proof that you are All for One?\nAwful for One: How do you prove yourself to be \u201chuman\u201d in those computer tests to verify you\u2019re not a robot?\nNezu: Definitely fake, but hilarious. I\u2019m going to arrange for this account to be verified.\n#\nOmake: If This AU Is Not Dad for One\nAll for One: (Scrolling through the twitter feed. )What a clever little troll. The most evil One for All user yet, and I mean that as a compliment. Time for some trolling back. How best to fake evidence that Izuku Midoriya is a clone created from my DNA and All Might\u2019s?\n#\nOmake: If This AU Is Dad for One\nAll for One: Izuku Midoriya, Nineth Wielder of One for All, I am\u2026your father!\nIzuku: Nice try, I already told that joke.\nAll for One: What are you talking about? It\u2019s not a joke.\nAll Might: I fell for that once, I\u2019m not falling for it again.\nAll for One: I\u2019m Hisashi Midoriya!\nIzuku: Yeah, sure, and next you\u2019ll tell me that Dr. Garaki is my new stepdad.\nBowing his head formally, Shouto Todoroki said, \u201cPlease teach me how to destroy my father as you obliterated your own sperm donor, Great Sensei Midoriya.\u201d\nSpinning around in his computer chair, Izuku glared. He had a hideous stomach ache, putting him in a bad mood. His forehead wrinkled. \u201cI keep telling you, All for One is not my father! Can\u2019t you go back to your All Might love child theory? That one had a much smaller impact on my sanity. See, how else would I have obtained so much All Might merch unless I was his secret lovechild or stealing it from Sir Nighteye?\u201d Izuku gestured around his bedroom. Every spare bit of wall had an All Might poster or an All Might figurine mounted on a shelf. The windows were covered in decals. All Might\u2019s white teeth gleamed in his trademark smile on the bedcover. The pillows had yellow hair tufts. The rug trim was circled by a dozen smiling All Mights wearing sunglasses.\nShouto nodded. \u201cI understand, it\u2019s a grave scandal that the Symbol of Peace and the Symbol of Evil had a secret lovechild. I will be more discrete.\u201d He mimed zipping his mouth.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you understand at all.\u201d Izuku leaned back in his chair and sighed. \u201cI wish I could help you embarrass Endeavor, but I don\u2019t remember what I did when I pretended to be All for One on twitter. It\u2019s all a drug-induced blur. I think it would be a lot harder to pretend to be Endeavor, since he\u2019s got an official account.\u201d\n\u201cI could hack his account,\u201d Shouto said. \u201cMy dad keeps all his passwords taped under his desk.\u201d\nIzuku blinked. \u201cOh, that is helpful. Hmm. Do you know any embarrassing stories about your father?\u201d\n\u201cOur family stories are mostly sad.\u201d\nIzuku winced, remembering the time Shouto had won a horror contest telling what he believed to be a fun story about his childhood. \u201cUm, could you post embarrassing photos of your father?\u201d\n\u201cOur family photo album mysteriously burned down, but I can look for backups online.\u201d Shouto lowered his voice and whispered, \u201cThe fire department has blacklisted us.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if you posted a bunch of conspiracy theories so ridiculous that even you don\u2019t believe them?\u201d Izuku spoke more rapidly as he warmed to his subject. \u201cOh, and you could pick fights with important people online to destroy Endeavor\u2019s reputation. Urk!\u201d He clutched his side.\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Shouto asked.\nIzuku attempted a smile. Sweat dripped down his forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve had a stomach ache all day. I might have eaten something bad. I\u2019m sure it will go away if I ignore it, like how I aggressively ignore all my pain.\u201d\n\u201cIs it because I talked about your father? Talking about my father makes me ill, too.\u201d\n\u201cI keep telling you, All for One is not my\u2014ow!\u201d Izuku fell over sideways.\nShouto ran to catch him, crying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll stop promoting that theory. What if you\u2019re All Might and Sir Nighteye\u2019s lovechild instead?\u201d\nSheer rage made Izuku sit up and cough up blood. Then his eyes rolled backward and he collapsed. The noise and shouting around him became distant. As the ambulance carried him away, he muttered in his sleep, \u201cAny imaginary father of mine would have given me his Tenth Anniversary All Might poster.\u201d\nIn the hospital, Izuku Midoriya was diagnosed with appendicitis and prepped for immediate surgery. The doctors were baffled, since no one in the modern era had appendixes. Well, except for the quirkless. But this boy had a strength ability.\nA note on Izuku\u2019s file stated that he was not to be put on the painkiller oxycodone under any circumstances. An overworked, inexperienced intern gave him RoxyBond. Unfortunately, RoxyBond was a brand name for oxycodone.\nShouto hummed under his breath as he knelt down and peered under his dad\u2019s desk. Ah-ha! He\u2019d found the list! Enji hadn\u2019t labeled all his passwords, which briefly worried Shouto, but at least he\u2019d marked his twitter password with a crudely drawn bird.\nBack in his room, Shouto locked the door and then logged into twitter as his father. Even though he couldn\u2019t have caused Izuku to develop an illness from the dawn of the age of quirks, Shouto still felt guilty. He knew just what would cheer his friend up\u2014tormenting horrible fathers! They both enjoyed that. As soon as the hospital allowed visitation, Shouto would show Izuku the results of their plan.\nEndeavor\u2019s twitter name was Flame_Hero. How boring. Smirking, Shouto changed his handle to EndNever.\nThe twitter account was barren except for a few posts about Endeavor\u2019s stats and retweeting articles praising him. Those had been created by an intern who had since left the agency. Nevertheless, Endeavor had a sizable following of his fans. Since Endeavor never checked twitter, Shouto expected to have free rein until a member of his father\u2019s agency caught him. He cracked his knuckles.\nWhat to do first? Shouto decided to start small.\n\nEndNever: I blew up my kitchen for the third time this month. Why do I keep installing a gas stove? #Hero problems\n\nThis had the advantage of being true, but for his next tweet Shouto went more ridiculous:\n\nEndNever: I ran out of hair gel today so I tried to use hair spray to style my spikes. Why did no one tell me that stuff is flammable? Does anyone know where I can get a good hat? #Hero problems #Hair problems\n\n\nEndNever: Why does my ranking keep rising no matter how much I suck as a hero? I\u2019m tempted to stop randomly arresting people and pretending they are villains. Having a mutant quirk while being out in public = maliciously loitering. #HPSC corruption\n\n\nEndNever: Why are those computer tests asking you to prove that you\u2019re human so ridiculously hard? @RatGod how do you prove yourself human? #Hero problems\n\nTime to pick some fights. Shouto giggled as he tagged Nezu. Then he tried to tag the HPSC president for his corruption tweet. Between the two of them, surely Endeavor would get absolutely destroyed. Huh, the HPSC didn\u2019t seem to have a twitter account. After two tries, Shouto finally found a new account to tag that looked close enough.\nFinally, Shouto typed up an extremely long analysis about how Lady Nagant had been a secret HPSC assassin, then tagged the HPSC again. Soon, his father\u2019s hero career would be absolutely ruined!\nLeaning back in his chair, Shouto waited for the replies.\nTossing and turning on his lumpy hospital bed, Izuku tried to get comfortable. A floaty feeling filled his mind, making words come bubbling up from his lips. He clamped his hand over his mouth to stop the mumbles from escaping. Distantly, he remembered what had happened the last time he\u2019d gotten too chatty after surgery. He didn\u2019t want to babble something that would get spread across twitter again.\nCome to think of it, wouldn\u2019t the problem be solved if he turned off voice commands on his phone? Izuku slurred, \u201cTurn\u2026off\u2026voice\u2026control? Assistant? Something\u2026yeah, that should take care of voice control.\u201d\nThe phone sitting on his bedside table replied, \u201cVoice control activated.\u201d\nOwlishly, Izuku blinked. He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d just heard, but he decided it must have worked and everything he said from this point forward would be harmless. \u201cGood thing I did that. After I created a fake account for All for One last time, who knows what I might do this time? I might pretend to be the HPSC president on twitter!\u201d\n\u201cOpening twitter,\u201d his phone said. \u201cCreating new account called, \u2018All for One who knows what I might do this time I might pretend to be the HPSC president on twitter.\u2019 Name is too long. Please provide another name.\u201d\n\u201cThe HPSC is, like, totally the worst,\u201d Izuku mused, his eyes darting in all directions as he scanned the cracks on the ceiling. It felt like there were ants crawling on his skin. He slapped his own face. \u201cTheir twitter account should be called\u2026hmm\u2026Help Preserve our Supreme Corruption.\u201d\n\u201cAccount created.\u201d\nIn a moment of drug-inspired brilliance, Izuku added, \u201cAlso, add a blue checkmark after the name so that everyone knows the account is legitimate. Better yet, add ten blue checkmarks.\u201d\n\u201cSearching for blue checkmark emoji. Emoji found. Ten emojis added.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa, I\u2019m the HPSC president now.\u201d Izuku laughed. \u201cThe power is going to my head. I feel dizzy. Could someone stop the room from spinning? I want to get off this ride.\u201d\n\u201cYou have been tagged in two tweets from EndNever.\u201d\n\u201cThe people love me already!\u201d Izuku declared, waving his finger in the air along the outline of a crack above. \u201cRead the tweets.\u201d\nAs Izuku listened, he nodded along. \u201cOh, yeah, Lady Nagant was definitely an HPSC assassin. You can post that. Shouto told me all about his theory yesterday and the evidence was overwhelming. Frankly it was his first conspiracy theory that I completely believe.\u201d\n\u201cTweet posted.\u201d\nSadly, Izuku said, \u201cThat stuff about disproportionate arrests for people with mutation quirks is also true. Did you know that mutants are twice as likely to be killed by heroes? Everyone should know that! I\u2019m going to tell the world!\u201d\n\u201cTweet posted.\u201d\n\u201cAnother th\u2014th\u2014thing. Prisoners with mutation quirks are more likely to be put under heavy restraints, placed in solitary confinement, or sent to Tartarus. Of course everyone in Tartarus is imprisoned under inhumane conditions.\u201d Izuku gnawed on his lower lip, tasting coppery blood. \u201cWe should abolish Tartarus.\u201d\n\u201cTweet posted.\u201d\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m at it, I, the HPSC president, grant all heroes and committee employees free mental health services and an extra two weeks of vacation.\u201d\n\u201cTweet posted.\u201d\n\u201cSince I\u2019m doing so much good in the world, I deserve something for myself.\u201d Izuku tried to think as ants danced behind his eyes. What did he desire more than anything except maybe becoming a hero? \u201cI demand one of every single piece of All Might merchandise in the world. I also demand all the Tenth Anniversary All Might posters. Ha-ha, Sir Nighteye will be furious!\u201d\n\u201cTweet posted.\u201d\n\u201cFurthermore, anyone who does not accept these HPSC decrees as completely and utterly true must be some kind of moron, because I have a hundred blue checkmarks after my name!\u201d\n\u201cAdditional checkmarks added.\u201d\nSitting behind the HPSC president\u2019s desk, Hawks drew up his wings and sulked. The president had left that morning on a vacation to Hawaii. Hawks had been begging for years for a vacation. Hell, he\u2019d groveled asking for just one day off work. Every single time, his requests had been denied. Between his hero job and the extra tasks assigned by the HPSC, apparently he was too busy for vacation days. But that hadn\u2019t stopped the president from taking an entire month off and assigning Hawks to do all her work in her absence.\nHawks already ate his meals while filing his paperwork, slept on a sleeping bag on the floor of his office, and only had time for four hours of sleep every night. Handling the HPSC president\u2019s paperwork on top of that would completely break his sanity. But he\u2019d still accepted the assignment without complaint because he\u2019d believed it would be a chance to help the League of Villains members imprisoned in Tartarus after the Awful for One incident. In spite of himself, Hawks had developed an attachment to the group of oddballs and wanted to offer them a second chance. Thinking about them in Tartarus made it even harder to get his scarce hours of sleep at night. Ever since the league\u2019s arrest, Hawks had been bugging the president for better prison conditions, plea bargains, and community service using their unique talents. He\u2019d been laughed at.\nUnfortunately, the president had anticipated what Hawks might do with a little power and specifically forbidden him from interfering in Tartarus without direct orders. Then she\u2019d vanished too quickly onto the airplane for him to protest. Hawks had spent an hour trying to hack into her computer without luck.\nWhat had he been thinking? It was all hopeless. He\u2019d never be anything except an HPSC pawn. Hawks slumped down with his head on the keyboard.\nMera pushed open the door. \u201cSir, there\u2019s been an online scandal about a fake HPSC account. We need damage control.\u201d\nHawks took the offered phone and rapidly scanned the tweets. His grin widened. \u201cOh, no, this account is entirely legitimate. The president told me that she was creating it before she went on vacation. I guess we have new orders from above! Time to launch a committee investigating discrimination against mutants and start Tartarus reforms. Oh, and let\u2019s release all the secret files on Lady Nagant.\u201d\nMera gaped in open disbelief. \u201cNo, this is extremely obviously fake.\u201d\n\u201cLook, this account has ten blue checkmarks, we can\u2019t argue with that.\u201d Hawks slung an arm around Mera\u2019s shoulder and whispered, \u201cAlso, two weeks of vacation is fourteen more days than we get right now.\u201d They both worked on weekends.\nMera rubbed his eyes, with their giant sleepless bags from overwork. \u201cWhoa, I just realized how genuine this account must be with its hypnotic bright blue checkmarks. I\u2019ll get that committee started before I go on leave. Finally I can see my children for the first time in years!\u201d\nWhistling, Hawks logged into his own official twitter account to verify that Help Preserve our Supreme Corruption was a completely legitimate HPSC account belonging to the president. Everything posted should be taken absolutely seriously as the word of the government.\nHawks didn\u2019t care who was behind the fake twitter account. The real HPSC president had never given him vacation time or mental health services.\nTapping his paws on his desk, Nezu read the tweet. He chuckled. \u201cAh, what an amusing prank, young Todoroki. And such useful timing! The moment has come for me to move against the HPSC.\u201d\nNezu added his own tweet concurring that the new HPSC account was completely real (as proven by the blue checkmarks.) Then he contacted a reporter acquaintance to arrange an article about discrimination against mutants and inhumane conditions in Tartarus. Next, Nezu emailed Hawks to arrange a meeting to discuss how they would use their window of power while the president was on vacation for maximum impact.\nFinally, Nezu made sure to praise Endeavor for drawing public attention to this corruption. Just to get a little revenge on young Todoroki for that cute attempt at trolling.\nShouto stated at twitter in confusion. Why wasn\u2019t this going anything like when Izuku had pretended to be All for One? Endeavor was receiving massive praise for his tweets! People were saying that he\u2019d blown open HPSC corruption. They liked how Endeavor had humanized heroes by admitting to his mistakes. They were complimenting Endeavor\u2019s great sense of humor.\nThis was ridiculous\u2014Shouto knew that his father had no sense of humor at all. Endeavour couldn\u2019t even manage dad jokes. Shouto couldn\u2019t help being a little happy that his Lady Nagant theory had been revealed to true. But why was his father getting credit for it? Why were there news articles praising Endeavor as the leader of reforming hero society? This was madness!\nFuriously, Shouto searched his father\u2019s google photos account for the most stupid and embarrassing pictures. He posted pictures of his father accidentally setting a monopoly board on fire, his father falling on the floor while dancing drunk at an office party, and his father trying to put on a hero costume that had arrived a size too small and ripping the shirt.\nThe likes and retweets started immediately. Shouto had a bad feeling that people were laughing with his father, not at him. What could he do that Endeavor would absolutely hate? Shouto channeled his inner Izuku and typed:\n\nEndNever: I would like to publicly confess that I\u2019ve only been critical of All Might because I\u2019m secretly in lust with him. I apologize for every negative thing that I\u2019ve ever said about the wonderful, handsome man.\n\nThe replies rapidly poured in:\n\nOMG Endeavor just came out as bisexual!\n\n\nThe first top bi hero! Bi representation!\n\n\nWe\u2019re proud of you for being so brave, Endeavor!\n\n\nIt takes a real man to admit his flaws. Good for you, Endeavor. I\u2019ve never been an Endeavor fan but today my mind has been changed.\n\nShouto slammed his forehead against his desk. They\u2019d completely missed the point! The gender hadn\u2019t been the issue, everyone had been supposed to mock Endeavor for admitting to his inferiority to All Might.\n\nEndNever: No, no, you\u2019re all supposed to hate me!\n\n\nHawks_Official: Endeavor, are you okay? The HPSC is starting a new program to help heroes with their mental health. You should take us up on it.\n\nWhy did people seem to like Endeavor more the lamer he got? Shouto ground his teeth. Taking a sip of his water bottle, he pondered. Maybe Shouto was going at this the wrong way. Maybe Endeavor had been more contemptible when he\u2019d been arrogant. Maybe it wasn\u2019t too late to try a new tactic to ruin his father\u2019s reputation. Shouto wouldn\u2019t give up!\nA new reply popped up, and Shouto made the mistake of looking at it.\n\nEndeavorSimp99: Endeavor I love you. I love you because you\u2019re a mess of insecurities taking them out on the world. I love you because you can\u2019t stop saying the wrong thing on television and you sail through life from one scandal to the next. I love how pathetic you are and how you never spend time with your family. I love how obviously you hate All Might and how adorably you rant about him. Most of all, I love that sexy chest bursting out of your costume plz post more naked chest pics. If your children don\u2019t want you then you can be my Daddy.\n\nShouto stopped reading. Half his face turned bright red and the other half frosted over. He deleted the twitter account.\nIzuku had been awake for nearly twenty-four hours. Maniac energy had filled him, making him unable to fall asleep. He\u2019d asked the nurse for sleeping pills but she\u2019d said that would be a bad idea, citing possible interactions with the painkillers. A doctor came by to take his temperature, monitor his pulse, and leave a bottle for a urine sample. She said that he was having a reaction to the RoxyBond but it would wear off, then ordered him to drink more water.\nAfter having drunk enough water to make his stomach bloated but still wide awake, Izuku was in a mood to take out his aggravation on the universe. Lying on his back, he stared at his phone screen, but it was too blurry for him to make out anything. \u201cAm I still on twitter, gnome who lives in my phone?\u201d\n\u201cOpening twitter,\u201d his phone replied. \u201cYou have thirty thousand, two hundred, and six new notifications.\u201d\nIzuku blinked owlishly. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not anything important. Time to critique some heroes and villains! First off, Hawks, if you know your weakness is running out of feathers then have you ever tried saving them? Also, that tan fur coat of yours reminds me of Overhaul, and I hope you have the common sense to realize that\u2019s not a compliment. Endeavor, for someone whose weakness is endurance, why did you make your costume so heavy? And for the love of god please shave off your moustache, it looks like a furry caterpillar.\u201d\n\u201cTweet posted. Tweet posted.\u201d\n\u201cDeath Arms, I heard you left a child die and then criticized another child for saving him. Yet somehow your greatest crime remains those amazingly ugly wrist-guards.\u201d\n\u201cTweet posted.\u201d\n\u201cMoving on to villains! Spinner, a gecko quirk ought to give you an amazing sense of smell, why don\u2019t you ever use that? Also I\u2019ve seen better Stain cosplays at an anime convention.\u201d\n\u201cUnable to find account for Spinner. Tweet posted.\u201d\n\u201cAll for One, what the hell man, you have hundreds if not thousands of quirks and your main method of fighting is swelling up your arm and punching people. You have clearly gone senile and should have retired a long time ago. I\u2019m not even going to touch the stupid-looking mask.\u201d\n\u201cTweet posted.\u201d\n\u201cAll Might, you\u2019re perfect as you are, just keep rocking it.\u201d\n\u201cTweet posted.\u201d\nSitting up, Izuku shouted, \u201cWill you stop saying that over and over again? You\u2019re making my head hurt even worse, phone gnome!\u201d\n\u201cTweet posted.\u201d\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a\u2026oh, never mind.\u201d Izuku rubbed his temples. He grabbed his water bottle and drank the rest. His stomach gurgled.\n\u201cYou have received a reply from Hawks_Official: For the record the costume was your idea, Madame President. I wanted a turquoise bodysuit with a golden chain and sunglasses, but you said it would look too villainous. How would you like to handle Tomura Shigaraki\u2019s brainwashing deprogramming?\u201d\nIzuku slurred, \u201cI dunno, give him a dog, everyone loves dogs.\u201d\n\u201cTweet posted.\u201d\n\u201cAargh! I told you to stop saying that! You are a bad phone and will be punished!\u201d Izuku threw his phone at the wall.\nThe One for All-powered force of his throw sent the phone clean through the wall. A scream came from the neighboring hospital room, then a sickening squelch.\nStanding up, Izuku peered over the pieces of plaster. A bald man lay on a hospital bed with all four of his limbs in casts. Blood spurted from where the phone stuck out of his skull.\nThe nurse rushed in. \u201cOh, no! You just killed the respected Dr. Garaki, chairman of Jaku General Hospital.\u201d\n\u201cIn my defense, that guy was very mean when he told me I didn\u2019t have a quirk as a child.\u201d Izuku stared at the bed, where Dr. Garaki/Tsubasa twitched very slightly. It was unclear if this was a death throe or if he was barely clinging to life. \u201cWhat\u2019s my childhood pediatrician doing here? This is all a dream, right? It must be a dream! Dr. Tsubasa vanished a long time ago.\u201d\nConfident in his theory, Izuku returned to his bed, pulled the covers of his head, and went to sleep. He slept through the arrival of the police, the discovery of files on Garaki\u2019s phone revealing experiments on children\u2019s corpses, and the authorities taking away the mostly dead Garaki. The police wanted to interrogate Izuku but acting HPSC President Hawks and Principal Nezu had ordered them to leave him alone.\nEnji pushed open the front door. \u201cI\u2019m home. Shouto, the strangest thing happened at work today.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, whatever.\u201d Shouto crouched on the living room couch with his knees pulled up to his chest, loudly playing an All Might video on the television in an attempt to ward off his father.\nIt didn\u2019t work. Enji said, \u201cI was given an award for promoting mental health awareness among heroes.\u201d He held up the plaque. \u201cExcept I don\u2019t remember doing anything? The award also came with an extra month of vacation and the HPSC absolutely insisted that I take it for my mental health. This is ridiculous, my ranking will slip if I\u2019m forced to take time off.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean I did sabotage you after all?\u201d Shouto shot to his feet and pumped his fist in the air. \u201cMy plan worked backwards! There\u2019s still justice in the universe!\u201d\nEnji said, \u201cOn the plus side, this means I\u2019ll have loads of time to spend with my family.\u201d\nShouto wailed, \u201cNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\u201d\nIzuku woke up to sun shining in his eyes and the whirr of a heart monitor from the room across the hallway. For some reason, the wall to his right had been caved in. The area was surrounded by police tape. Also, his phone was missing. Sitting up, he coughed to clear the soreness in his throat. He winced, feeling the stitches in his chest throb. His head ached. He had the vague sensation that he\u2019d done something terrible last night but he couldn\u2019t remember anything. Hopefully it was just his low self-esteem talking.\nYoichi popped up next to the hospital bed, the light from the window shining through his ghostly figure. \u201cNinth, I want to congratulate you on redeeming Tomura Shigaraki. I\u2019ve persuaded the others to accept your viewpoint. Truly, you are an inspiration to us all. You\u2019re just naturally heroic.\u201d\n\u201cI did what now?\u201d Izuku asked.\nBoy and ghost stared at each other awkwardly for a moment. Yoichi said, \u201cSo anyway, to reward your heroism, Second and Third will finally give you their quirks.\u201d He winked frantically.\nIzuku clasped his hands together. \u201cOf course, I redeemed Tomura, it\u2019s all coming back to me now. I felt like the two of us had a special bond from the moment he tried to decay me at the mall. Which quirks am I going to get?\u201d\nSecond appeared next to Yoichi. Looking down at Izuku, he said, \u201cFor the record, I didn\u2019t change my mind because you got Tomura a dog, although that was a clever move. I\u2019m extremely impressed that you committed manslaughter, unlike all these modern heroes too good to get their hands dirty. Finally we have a successor with balls.\u201d\n\u201cI DID WHAT NOW?!\u201d Izuku shrieked\nThe air wavered, then Third stood with his arms crossed and scowling. \u201cI never agreed to this!\u201d\nYoichi elbowed Third. \u201cStop pretending not to approve of Ninth. I know you\u2019re just trying to keep your quirk secret because it\u2019s lame.\u201d\nThird glared. \u201cShould the guy who got the useless half of All for One\u2019s power call anyone else\u2019s quirk lame?\u201d\nThe hospital room went completely silent. From the Void, Banjo shouted, \u201cOh no he didn\u2019t!\u201d\nWith an inhuman howl, Yoichi lunged at Third. Second tried to get between them and they all fell backward into the Void. Shrieking and slapping sounds came from the distance.\n\u201cHmm, I wonder if I can steal their quirks while they\u2019re distracted?\u201d Izuku mused. He closed his eyes and concentrated. Green sparks danced down his arm. \u201cExcellent. I wonder who\u2019s power that is?\u201d Planning to look up his new quirk, Izuku hunted around for his phone. He found it lying among the plaster, covered in blood. \u201cWhoa, that\u2019s disturbing.\u201d A blurry memory lurked at the edges of his mind. He kept seeing his childhood doctor but that must have been a drug-fueled hallucination.\nThe phone rang. Izuku dropped it, accidentally hitting speakerphone. Tomura\u2019s voice echoed through the drafty room: \u201cI\u2019ve finally tracked you down, Awful for One! I was going to decay you for tricking me, but then you got me a pet dog so we\u2019re cool now. In fact, I\u2019ve even decided to swear loyalty to you since you\u2019re clearly a way better villain than Sensei.\u201d\n\u201cShhhh!\u201d Izuku hissed, grabbing his phone. \u201cI can\u2019t have you go around telling people that I\u2019m a villain! I\u2019m already in enough trouble for whatever got blood on my phone.\u201d\nTomura continued, \u201cI just need a small favor in return. The Metahuman Liberation Army kidnapped my broker. I\u2019m still in a correctional facility so it\u2019s not easy for me to rescue him.\u201d\nIzuku said, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like my problem.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re threatening to cut Giran\u2019s fingers off! Please? Pretty please? I won\u2019t tell anyone that you\u2019re the leader of the League of Villains now, and I\u2019ll let you analyze my quirk.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not your leader but I do want to analyze your quirk.\u201d Izuku tapped his chin, considered. \u201cOkay, first we\u2019re going to create a fake twitter account for Re-Destro\u2026\u201d\nAll for One had taken dozens of showers to get Garaki off himself including repeatedly bathing in blood, but he still felt unclean. He had a nagging sense that he was forgetting something\u2014oh, right, he needed to go rescue his losers from Tartarus.\nDropping down from the sky in front of two prison guards, All for One summoned the full force of his menacing aura. With a twisted smile, he demanded, \u201cGuide me to the League of Villains and maybe I won\u2019t kill you.\u201d\nReleasing a faint scent of urine into the air, a guard said, \u201cT-they aren\u2019t here any longer. Tartarus is no longer a prison.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re lying. Have you gone mad from fear?\u201d All for One tilted his head. \u201cNo matter, I\u2019ll find them myself.\u201d He shouldered past the stunned guards and opened the door.\nA massive pile of All Might merchandise poured out: everything from apparel to posters to figurines to comic books. All for One was buried from head to toe. Only one finger stuck out, twitching.\nThe guard said, \u201cI tried to tell you that the HPSC president ordered Tartarus converted to a massive All Might merchandise warehouse. She said her new collection and all her Tenth Anniversary posters must be kept in the safest place on earth.\u201d\nThe other guard coughed. \u201cHe can\u2019t hear you, he\u2019s unconscious. We should arrest him before he wakes up and slaughters us.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d The first guard quickly pulled out his handcuffs. \u201cHey, do you think we\u2019ll get a reward for arresting the Symbol of Evil?\u201d\n\u201cDepends on if he got any blood on the merchandise.\u201d The second guard shook his head. \u201cThe president was really intense about the need to keep the merch spotless. We\u2019re in big trouble if he bled on it.\u201d\nOMAKE TIME!\nOmake: Meanwhile at U.A.\nAll Might: The new HPSC account is clearly young Midoriya, right? I\u2019m very proud that I can recognize his drug-fueled writing style now. Should we do something about that?\nEraserhead: I\u2019ll have the energy to care about whatever the problem child is up to when Nezu gives me an extra two weeks of vacation. Besides, did you see how blue those checkmarks were?\n#\nOmake: First Attempt at Name Change\nShouto: I\u2019m going to change my dad\u2019s twitter name to IHateEndeavor\u2014hey, that name is already taken! I should have seized that first.\nDabi: You would have needed to be born first.\nShouto: Big brother! Please give me advice on how to torment our father. Everything I do backfires and benefits Endeavor.\nDabi: Whoa, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. That\u2019s tragic. I\u2019m no longer jealous of you. In fact, I pity you too much to kill you.\n#\nOmake: The Tell\nHawks: I know that you\u2019re not the real Endeavor.\nShouto: How can you tell? I even hacked his official account.\nHawks: You don\u2019t have a blue checkmark.\n#\nOmake: True Motives Revealed While Under the Influence\nAll Might: Did you want One for All to become a hero or because it was the ultimate piece of merchandise?\nIzuku: Yes.\n#\nOmake: Family Bonding\nEnji: Shouto, why am I a bisexual icon now?\nShouto: I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a mystery why anyone would want you. Why don\u2019t you ask EndeavorSimp99?\nEnji: Who?\nShouto: I\u2019ll show you the tweets, that way I can at least get a bit of amusement out of my miserable failure.\n#\nOmake: Shouto\u2019s Happy Ending\nLady Nagant: Thank you for starting the movement that led to me being freed from Tartarus.\nShouto: That conspiracy theory was true? Even I thought that one was far-fetched. And I believe that All for One is from the dawn of the age of quirks.\nLady Nagant: \u2026\nShouto: \u2026\nLady Nagant: Do you want to hear about some real government conspiracies?\nShouto: Boy, do I ever!\n#\nOmake: Maybe the Real Heroism was the All Might Merchandise We Stole Along the Way\nAll Might: Young Midoriya, Dr. Garaki is in a coma and it\u2019s touch and go if he\u2019ll pull through.\nIzuku: Am I going to get expelled?\nAll Might: Of course not! You caught a villain who had infiltrated Jaku General Hospital. We\u2019re going to give you a medal. The new HPSC is much cooler with vigilantism. Speaking of which, congratulations on destroying the MLA.\nIzuku: Ha-ha, I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about!\nAll Might: And defeating All for One. You have proven a worthy Ninth successor to One for All.\nIzuku: This time I sincerely have no idea what you\u2019re talking about but I\u2019ll still take credit.\nAll Might: I\u2019m trying to figure out why my former sidekick is on the run from the police. Something about Sir Nighteye refusing to turn over a contraband Tenth Anniversary poster?\nIzuku: I DON\u2019T HAVE THEM ALL YET? I mean, I\u2019d like to volunteer to help you out, sir. I\u2019m sure amnesty can be arranged if Sir Nighteye turns over his entire merch collection."
