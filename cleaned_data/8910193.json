    "text": "\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be putting you in groups now,\u201d the professor said, and Taehyung could have sworn she looked right at him, which meant he\u2019d probably be stuck with the calmest, most productive, most boring students instead of the pothead in the corner and the girl with the really crazy teal hair. When last he\u2019d been left to assemble his own group, there\u2019d been tears by the end of class, five college-students bouncing off the walls on a noticeable sugar high, and expo-marker mustaches on half the class.\nHe fidgeted with his pen, trying to figure out how to effectively entangle it in his hair, and by the time he refocused on class, one pen hanging from his bangs, everyone was getting up into groups and he\u2019d completely missed who his teammates were.\n\u201cUm, Karla\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, did someone mispronounce \u2018Dr. Jacobs?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cDr. Karla, dear, which group am I in?\u201d\nShe fixed him with a very tired glare, and Taehyung grinned back. He\u2019d earned a perfect score on every assignment but the last group project, and so she was reluctantly patient with him. \u201cYou\u2019re with Wheein, Solar, and Jungkook doing the Hercules myth.\u201d He loved the Hercules myth. Besides being a damn good Disney movie with a killer soundtrack, something about the lion\u2019s coat, the heroic deeds, the fucking muscles on all those old sculptures got him a little hot.\nBut fuck. He had no idea what to make of any of those teammates, the two highly intelligent but wildly personable girls that always sat in the front, and Jeon Jungkook, one of those silent, back-of-the-room jock types that Taehyung loved to fantasize about when he was drunk enough. Jungkook especially tended to draw his eyes in class, long legs sticking out from under his slouch, lots of straight, white teeth visible even when he wasn\u2019t smiling, and over-flowing with the captivating kind of masculinity that was both quiet and gorgeously confident. \nBefore they could even get all together, Solar had a group chat, meeting place, and schedule, as well as the materials they were responsible for during the first meeting. Taehyung felt the odd lightness of realizing he wouldn\u2019t have to carry this group project by himself. \n\u201cGot all of that?\u201d She said. \nWheein smacked her pen on the table. \u201cGot it.\u201d\nTaehyung exchanged a wide-eyed look with Jungkook, and they both shook their heads at once. Jungkook shook his head a little more to get his bangs evenly across his forehead, and Taehyung locked onto that surprisingly adorable tick like a bloodhound with a scent. \n\u201cI\u2019ll email it,\u201d Solar said. \u201cSee you both tomorrow.\u201d\nTaehyung bounced and grinned, already revving up for a good, organized project. He hadn\u2019t been on a team with people who cared in quite a while. Jungkook nodded and murmured, \u201cThanks,\u201d in his steady, quiet voice. His eyes flickered to Taehyung under his bangs, and then awkwardly away. Fucking cute.\nAdorable as he was, Jungkook strode down the hallway like he owned it, shoulders squared, knees wide, hands in his pockets, completely at odds with the way he\u2019d ducked his head when they talked, the way he spoke shortly and softly when the teacher called on him in class. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Solar and Wheein jostling each other and giggling as they watched Jungkook walk down the hall.\n\u00a0\nThey gathered in a corner of the library on the floor like permitted obnoxious amounts of noise. Solar immediately took charge, which put Taehyung at a loss, since that\u2019s what he usually did. Her leadership style was all organization, allotting an equal chunk of work to everyone and directing the discussion. \nWithin five minutes, Taehyung could tell that she and Wheein had pretty much already finished the project down to the last detail with the exception of actually doing it. Jungkook kept glancing at his phone and sighing quietly, slouching further in his chair, knees spread wide, one Timberland boot propped up on the central footrests. He had his hair up in a beanie, and god damn he looked good. \nTaehyung tried to propose an examination of Hercules through talking about what he\u2019d be like in a modern setting, and Solar shot it down immediately. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the cultural context that the Hercules myth served, what values he represented.\u201d\nTaehyung slumped. \u201cBut everyone does that. That\u2019s easy. We could get more creative with it and talk about what he\u2019d represent in our society and use that as comparison. And it would be fun.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Wheein said. \u201cThat seems kind of, well, trivial?\u201d\n\u201cHow is that\u2026trivial. That\u2019d be\u2026\u201d his voice got quieter and quieter, back caving as he sank lower in the seat, pulling himself smaller and staring up from under his lashes, \u201cso much fun.\u201d \nBoth girls leapt up out of their seats and dove on him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! It\u2019s fine! That sounds super cute, I mean fun, just stop pouting!\u201d Always worked like a charm. Jungkook mouth twitched upwards a little as he watched from behind his phone, eyes warming.\n\u201cI\u2019m so serious though,\u201d he whined from under Solar\u2019s armpit. \u201cSolar, I know you\u2019ve got all this shit planned out and all that, and thank you so much. You\u2019re super responsible. But can we start over for just a minute? Jungkook hasn\u2019t said a single thing since we sat down and it's not really a group project if it's all you. We need to talk this out.\u201d\nNow it was Solar pouting, but Taehyung would not be swayed. From behind their cuddle puddle, Jungkook looked very caught in the headlights, like he couldn\u2019t imagine actually being required to participate. \n\u201cFirst off, how much does everyone know about Hercules? Is everyone at least familiar with this material?\u201d\nSolar and Wheein were both Greek mythology buffs. Taehyung had seen every Hercules movie ever produced, plus he\u2019d paid attention in high school literature. Jungkook didn\u2019t even know his Greek name was Heracles. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the movie with The Rock,\u201d he said uncertainly. \u201cI think we talked about it in AP Lit last year for like, one day.\u201d\n\u201cLast year?\u201d Wheein asked. \u201cAre you a freshman?\u201d\nJungkook nodded reluctantly, phone tapping against his thigh. \n\u201cDo you play sports?\u201d Taehyung asked. \u201cYou look like you play sports.\u201d\nJungkook brows drew together, confused. It really had nothing to do with the conversation, so Taehyung didn\u2019t blame him. \u201cYeah. Soccer, I think. Some weightlifting. Track. I used to play basketball.\u201d \n\u201cJack of all trades? You work out a lot?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, kind of.\u201d\nTaehyung saw the girls\u2019 expressions change from indifference to interest, slight smirks sliding onto their faces, eyes slimming just a little and running up and down Jungkook\u2019s body. You're welcome, he thought. Jungkook didn\u2019t notice, too busy staring at Taehyung as if hoping for an explanation, or at least more conversation, which didn\u2019t happen. \nFor Jungkook\u2019s sake, Solar, Wheein, and Taehyung went into story-telling mode, retelling the myth and how exactly it related back to Greek culture and the hero archetype, a little bit about motifs. Jungkook nodded blankly, mouth hanging slightly open, two front teeth just visible under his arching top lip, adorable. \nTaehyung got to work convincing the group to do something ridiculous with the project. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone\u2019s going to have in their projects. People have looked at this myth a million times in relation to the culture. We could do what we did right now in front of the class and get a pretty good grade. Easy and Boring. Last time I did a group project in this class we made it super weird, had the time of our fucking lives, and scored a B+, and that was with a couple people on the team not helping at all. I think we can do better this time.\u201d\n\u201cB+?\u201d Solar said, looking alarmed, at the same time that Jungkook murmured, \u201cI could really use a B+.\u201d\nThey both looked at him. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing very well. I\u2019m considering dropping it to keep my GPA safe. I\u2019ve gotta pass this class for my literature requirement but I have to get good enough grades to play soccer when the season starts.\u201d \nTaehyung was pretty sure he, Solar, and Wheein had the highest grades in the class. It occurred to him that it might have been Jungkook that Dr. Karla was trying to help when she made this group, and not himself.\n\u201cThen don\u2019t you think we should play it safe?\u201d Solar said. \nHe shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll struggle no matter what. Just let me know what I need to do.\u201d\n\u201cSee, that\u2019s why I think we need to make it weird. If we do this on just book-smart analysis, the three of us are fine, but Jungkook gets left in the dust. If we make it weird, we\u2019re all equally challenged\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcept you,\u201d Wheein said.\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard work being this unpredictable.\u201d\nJungkook cracked the real grin that Taehyung had ever seen from him, all pretty white teeth and crinkly eyes, lips curling mischievously up at the corners. Both ladies did the thing again, the slight smirk and wandering eyes. Jungkook remained oblivious, eyes sinking back to his phone, even as the smile remained on his face. Taehyung snickered. \nThey began talking about Hercules in the context of Greek society to try and get a feel for what they could do, and halfway through, Jungkook shrugged out of his hoodie. \nHe was wearing a t-shirt with the sleeves cut off, riding low over his ribs. His incredible, sculpted arms crossed, forearms thick across his thin shirt, which clung to the hard lines of his chest. Solar prompted Taehyung for the answer to a question he\u2019d just ignored.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t possibly be expected to concentrate with Jungkook wearing that shirt. I\u2019m a little wet.\u201d\nHe expected, from the disinterested jock, maybe an expression of alarmed surprise, at best a confident laugh, at worst a look of disgust. He\u2019d gotten worse from that type before. He didn\u2019t expect the wide-eyed surprise, and then the sweetest bashful smile he\u2019d ever seen on any human ever. He glanced up at Taehyung under his lashes and murmured, \u201cSorry. I\u2019ll cover up again,\u201d and pulled the hoodie back over his shoulders like a cape. \n\u201cHold on a minute, just because Taehyung can\u2019t handle it doesn\u2019t mean the rest of us should be deprived. Get those back out here,\u201d Wheein said. \nJungkook shook his head, still smiling with his head down. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna be a distraction.\u201d\nThey had no good ideas. \u201cFamous sports figure?\u201d\n\u201cNah, they had those in ancient Greece. Athletes and stuff. They got a lot more glory and honor than Hercules got.\u201d\n\u201cMercenary then?\u201d\n\u201cThose only exist in action movies.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit. Those totally exist.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we know nothing about them.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s myth,\u201d Jungkook said. \u201cCould we compare it to modern fiction, like James Bond or something?\u201d \nSolar and Wheein nodded thoughtfully. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not superhuman enough, though,\u201d Taehyung said, lying down and stretching out across his couch. \u201cHercules is the son of a god. He\u2019s not like James Bond. He\u2019s incredible. He\u2019s got to be physically a step above everyone around him, like Superman. But, like, less than Superman. Batman?\u201d\nHe looked at Jungkook, who was staring blankly at Taehyung\u2019s midsection, eyes glazed. Taehyung glanced down and saw that his shirt had ridden up under his woolen sweater, revealing a strip of tan skin, the dip of his hips, and the edge of his navel. And, oh wow, Jungkook was staring at it. He stretched a little further, arms flat on the couch over his head, knees raising. \n\u201cHow much,\u201d Jungkook said, snapping his eyes away from Taehyung like he\u2019d been paying attention the whole time. Maybe he\u2019d just been zoning out. Were his cheeks a little redder than before? \u201cDoes everyone know about the WWE? Professional wrestling and all that,\u201d he asked.\n\u201cJohn Cena!\u201d Taehyung yelled, leaping up from the the couch. \u201cJohn Cena is Hercules!\u201d\n\u201cI was thinking more The Rock,\u201d Jungkook said. \u201cHe\u2019s part of a wrestling dynasty. He has a lot of family in the business, so the son of gods thing can come in there. He\u2019s the people\u2019s champion. He\u2019s suitably super-human. The powers-that-be within the fictional wrestling universe put him up to some pretty impossible odds sometimes, and now he\u2019s one of the god-like legends.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fucking perfect!\u201d Taehyung yelled. \u201cOh my god, we could have a wrestling match in class!\u201d\n\u201cThe fuck?\u201d Wheein said, \u201cNo, Tae, that\u2019s kind of stupid and probably not allowed. Or safe.\u201d\n\u201cThis is going to be so good.\u201d\n\u201cTae, get ahold of yourself.\u201d\n\u201cCan you wrestle, Jungkook?\u201d\n\u201cI, um, I could probably learn pretty fast.\u201d\n\u201cCould you be Hercules? Can you pick people up and throw them around or something?\u201d\nJungkook shrugged out of his hoody and lurched forward, shoulder ramming right into Taehyung\u2019s hips, arms closing around his body, and then he stood, Taehyung hooked over his rock-hard, bulging shoulder. He yelped. The ground looked very strange from that angle, straight down Jungkook\u2019s back and over his butt. His hands scrabbled in Jungkook\u2019s shirt and Jungkook jostled him into position. \nTaehyung felt one heavy hand on his hip, the other hot of the backs of his thighs, horribly wonderful. Jungkook swung around to face the girls, easy as anything. Taehyung felt his voice rumble through his back, \u201cIs this strong enough?\u201d like it took no effort at all, and his eyes slammed shut, dizziness rocking through him, the punch of arousal swelling in his cock warring with the gravity rush of blood down into his head. \nIn high school, before Taehyung\u2019s growth spurt really hit, the boys in his class would pick him up and carry him around to show off their strength. Because he was small, crazy, and looked like a kid, it didn\u2019t feel gay to them yet. They did it to impress the girls, to be hot shit, and somewhere along the way his brain had irreparably linked being carried to being sexy. \nIt was a kink he\u2019d forgotten he\u2019d had. Nobody had carried him in years, not since he\u2019d grown almost a foot. Not since Kevin from band class had caught on to the way Taehyung\u2019s cheeks blazed red when he picked him up, the way his breath came short and how he squeezed his legs up closer to his chest. Kevin had thrown him into a pile of chairs like he was a rabid animal. Nobody had really been all that sympathetic about the cracked ribs. \nJungkook was more gentle than Kevin, more self-assured. Stronger. Taehyung felt off-balance and too hot, small in the best way. He made a sound like a scared puppy, a breathless, high-pitched, strangled yelp of a moan. The girls squealed and Jungkook giggled, showing off, basking in their attention as Taehyung clung to his back and gasped. Jungkook felt him slip a little and bounced him up, lifting him easily, so easily, by the hips, and resettled him closer to his neck. His hand slid warm and tingling wonderfully over his ass, and gripped there, squeezing, holding him steady like he didn\u2019t even notice. Taehyung\u2019s hands shook.\nThrough the wild wash of arousal pounding across his system, painfully intense, Taehyung dimly realized he was panting hard, legs kicking uselessly, hands fisted in the fabric of Jungkook\u2019s shirt. He could see Jungkook\u2019s tan skin where it disappeared down into his boxers before is vision started swimming. His dick hardened quickly against the firm pressure of Jungkook\u2019s hard shoulder. \nTaehyung could tell Jungkook felt that awkward bump that shouldn\u2019t be there when he started struggling, because the moment he felt the incredible pleasure of rocking his dick down, even accidentally, a small, high sound squeaked out of his mouth, and Jungkook dropped him back onto his feet so fast it felt like falling. His knees caved. Jungkook caught him and he hung there for a moment, gripping Jungkook\u2019s arms and staring up into his sparkly, dark, incredibly wide eyes, and then his hard dick knocked up against Jungkook\u2019s thigh. He gasped, eyes flickering shut in horror. \nJeon Jungkook, who had begun to seem like the cutest guy on the planet, knew Taehyung had just gotten super hard in under fifteen seconds just from behind manhandled. What a weirdo.\n\u201cTaehyung?\u201d Jungkook said, gravelly and quiet, \u201cwhat\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Taehyung whispered, wrestling his body up onto his feet and out of Jungkook\u2019s grasp. He sat down on the couch and pulled his knees up to his chest, heart pounding. Jungkook hesitated a moment, then flopped back into his seat. \nThe girls stared back and forth between then in cautious silence. Taehyung felt his face burning brighter and brighter. \n\u201cOkay, we should get back to planning. I like the wrestling thing. Maybe we could reinvent Hercules\u2019s quest as a wrestling story-line? And replace Greek social values and the way they understood these myths with more American themes? Any input, Tae?\u201d\nTaehyung cleared his throat. \u201cThat sounds good.\u201d His voice crackled quietly anyway. \nJungkook shifted uncomfortably, and a seething pool of shame condensed in Taehyung\u2019s stomach.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it? Anything else? What just happened? Are you okay?\u201d\nTaehyung nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just\u2026never mind. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\nSolar tried to get the planning back on track. She and Wheein outlined a basic storyline for \u2018Lion Cena,\u2019 the heavy-weight, Hulk Hogan-esque wrestler, son of John Cena come to claim his father\u2019s legacy, cruelly opposed by the CEO of the company and forced to battle through all his best wrestlers, a series of corporate hoops, and an actual bear in order to get a shot at the Championship belt. Jungkook said nothing for twenty minutes, arms tight over his chest like he wanted to cover himself, and embarrassment gnawed at Taehyung until he thought he might cry.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna go,\u201d he said eventually, quiet enough that Wheein had to ask him to repeat himself. \u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d he said, a little louder, \u201cI feel pretty useless right now. Can we meet up later?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe skipped the next group meeting. He\u2019d rushed out of the first one so fast that he\u2019d left his notebook behind, which Jungkook wordlessly handed back to him in class the next day, expression unreadable. Taehyung quickly averted his eyes.\nTaehyung couldn\u2019t take part in the class discussion. He went back to his room shaky and unhappy. When the group meeting rolled around that afternoon he didn\u2019t go, just curled up on his bed, anxious and tired, guilty for not going, relieved for not being there, embarrassed by how terribly obvious he was being. Jungkook might tell Solar and Wheein what had happened. They\u2019d treat him like a freak for the rest of the semester. He\u2019d gotten so tired of that.\nThe bed felt too short, with his head on the pillow, his toes hung off the end. He rolled over and curled up. He wanted Jungkook wrapped around his back, lips on his hair, telling him that it was okay. Pathetic. Jungkook, who never wanted anything to do with him. Poor Jungkook.\nTaehyung had gotten a single-person room for a reason. The extra five-hundred dollars a year for a room to his own was worth every penny on nights when he just needed a couple hours alone without the hassle of sexiling a roommate with no second person to use an excuse. Sometimes he just wanted to curl up with a hot pink vibrator and silk panties and just feel soft for a little while behind a locked door. \nHe wanted that now. He wanted more than that. He wanted strong arms and a deep voice, and he wanted to be pretty for someone. He got his silk, lilac boy-shorts out of his dresser, tight and soft on his body, and hugged a pillow to try to chase away the fidgeting discomfort gnawing at the warmth licking steadily up from the silk on his skin. This usually ended in him painfully hard with two fingers in himself and his face flushed and hidden in the pillow. He only need to wait. \nIt didn\u2019t come. Jungkook stayed in his mind. The silk hugged him uselessly. The bed was so warm if he stayed still but too cold if he stretched out. \nHe woke up with sunlight angling sleepily down through his curtains and someone knocking on his door. He\u2019d only been asleep thirty minutes. He had just enough awareness to pull a shirt and some jeans on over the lilac silk, though he took a minute to pet it affectionately first, and then opened the door. \nIt was Jungkook, glorious and broad-shouldered slouching, and so lovely that Taehyung\u2019s breath fizzled out of him before he could help it. He was already several paces down the hall, but he whipped around the moment Taehyung\u2019s door opened. Taehyung actually jumped, just a little jolt when their eyes met, and Jungkook tensed up like he\u2019d scared a small animal, hands open reassuringly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to grab you again. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nTaehyung mouth went dry, nervous shivers racing down his arms. Jungkook looked so fucking good in dark green flannel. He shouldn\u2019t be in front of Taehyung\u2019s door. Why would he be there? \u201cHey, um, sorry. I know I missed the group meeting. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t come. I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He cringed into the doorframe as Jungkook took a couple tentative steps closer, hands still up cautiously. \u201cAnd sorry about, you know, making it weird the other day,\u201d he said, voice fading out.\nJungkook shook his head. \u201cNot a big deal. You\u2019re fine. I\u2019m so sorry if I made you uncomfortable. I should\u2019ve asked before, you know, throwing you over my shoulder like a corpse. You seem kind of messed up. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\nTaehyung stammered, then shrugged. \u201cIt didn\u2019t bother you at all? I thought...\u201d He knocked his head gently against the doorframe. \u201cWow, I\u2019m just pathetic.\u201d\n\u201cTae, no.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really sorry. I know how I am. I have these kinks and I try to hide them because they\u2019re weird, and when things happen sometimes I get embarrassed. And then apparently I hide in my room instead of facing my problems.\u201d\nJungkook shuffled his unnecessarily big boots around for a minute, then pulled Taehyung into a very unexpected hug. They were the same height, but Taehyung felt awkwardly tall, too big in his body. It was still so warm, so sweet and protective, like Jungkook was trying to wrap his shoulders around him. \u201cStop looking so defeated. It sucks. I don\u2019t get it. You\u2019re fine. What was the kink that I got you with the other night?\u201d\nTaehyung had melted into his arms, breathless, taken aback by his brashness. Jeon Jungkook was hugging him and he could feel the hard rise of his chest pressing against his own. It wasn\u2019t fair. \u201cI think I like being carried. It\u2019s a strength thing, I think? Manhandling? I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t mean to drag you into\u2014\u201d\nJungkook locked all his muscles, turning into a hard wall around him. Taehyung shivered. \u201cOh yeah. That\u2019s,\u201d he got a lung-full of Jungkook\u2019s scent, laundry detergent with a little bit of heady cologne and something human and dark. \u201cFuck.\u201d\nJungkook\u2019s cheek brushed so lightly against his. \u201cThat\u2019s not weird. That\u2019s cute as fuck.\u201d\n\u201cIt is?\u201d Taehyung squeaked. Jungkook just hummed and kissed the corner of Taehyung\u2019s lips. Taehyung\u2019s knees shook, chest constricting hard. He hadn\u2019t been kissed in ages, not by someone who mattered. \n\u201cThis is okay, right?\u201d Jungkook murmured. \u201cYou like me, right? Am I reading this wrong?\u201d\nTaehyung choked, clinging to his shirt, fizzy excitement climbing up his throat. \u201cGod, you dumb jock. You\u2019re so hot. Why didn\u2019t you tell me you kissed boys?\u201d\nJungkook giggled. \u201cDidn\u2019t think it mattered. Didn\u2019t expect you to be interested. You\u2019re all so much smarter than me.\u201d\nTaehyung pulled Jungkook\u2019s face away for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re not stupid though.\u201d\n\u201cI make shit grades.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re impressive in other ways. Please kiss me again.\u201d\nJungkook smiled happily and kissed him again, a soft peck to the left side of his bottom lip, arms still latched around Taehyung\u2019s back.\nTaehyung pressed back with a groan, lips sloppy and needy. \u201cCome in here,\u201d he said, pulling Jungkook in and shutting the door. Jungkook shouldered him up against the wall, forearms flat behind his shoulders, boxing him in, lips and tongue slick and soft against Taehyung\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know much about you,\u201d Taehyung murmured.\n\u201cBusiness major,\u201d Jungkook said.\n\u201cOf course you are,\u201d Taehyung said. \u201cI\u2019m a psych major.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so precious.\u201d\nTaehyung wiggled happily against him. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d he sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking hot. Oh my god. When you picked me up. Fuck. You\u2019re so strong.\u201d \nJungkook\u2019s hands slid under his clothes, thumbs petting his stomach, palms sliding over his sides, fingers dipping over Taehyung\u2019s ass, testing.\nHe gasped, jittery with want. Jungkook\u2019s hands did drew back off his jeans, one running up over his chest, the other tight around his back again. \n\u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured, \"I keep forgetting to ask. I'm bad at this.\"\n\u201cSorry? You're fine. Keep going.\u201d\nJungkook smiled against his lips and murmured, \u201cTae,\u201d crushing in closer as Taehyung panted and clung to his wide biceps, chest pressing desperately upwards into Jungkook\u2019s hand where his fingers left pulsing trails over his skin. \n\u201cPlease,\u201d he murmured. \u201cPlease. Please.\u201d\n\u201cAre you begging already?\u201d Jungkook asked, sounding surprised.\n\u201cFuck, it\u2019s been so long and you\u2019re so hot. Jungkook, please.\u201d\nJungkook pulled away for a moment, yanked the beanie off his hair and ran a hand through it, looking intently at Taehyung, who sagged, panting against the wall. Jungkook was there, in his room, lips red and wet and fucking kissing him, dark hair swept up off his forehead and eyes hard as they took Taehyung in, panting and needy against the wall of his own bedroom. His knees got a little shaky. \u201cYou want this?\u201d Jungkook said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little sudden.\u201d\nBlood pounded through Taehyung\u2019s head. His lips tingled. He could still feel the brick-wall feeling of Jungkook\u2019s chest against his. \u201cYeah. I want this.\u201d\nJungkook lurched forward and reached down, sweeping Taehyung suddenly up into his arms, bridal style. His weight settled, several feet off the ground, the heat of Jungkook\u2019s thick chest against his side. Jungkook walked him towards the bed, but stopped when Taehyung squeaked out a long, airy sound of happiness.\n\u201cTae?\u201d\nTaehyung gulped, searching for something to stall Jungkook and prevent him from putting him down. \u201cYou know that old Gone with the Wind poster? Where she\u2019s in a red dress and there\u2019s a bunch of fire and a hot guy? Scarlet O'Hara? I feel like her.\u201d \nJungkook giggled, swaying back and forth a little, rocking Taehyung in his arms and letting him go limp. He could feel his own weight, feel the way Jungkook\u2019s arms locked to keep him up, and his breath picked up, dick achingly hard already, head swimming with hormones. \n\u201cFuck. I\u2019ve never read it. I haven\u2019t even seen the movie. Mom had the book, and when I was younger I stared at that picture for hours. I\u2014fuck. I wanted\u2014\u201d He covered his face with his hands. \u201cWhy am I telling you this?\u201d\nJungkook curled his arms and pulled him up close, impossibly stronger. Taehyung whined pitifully, the sour ache of arousal twisting in his gut. \u201cPlease. Jungkook.\u201d\n\u201cHands off your face?\u201d Jungkook said, and his voice only shook a little from the effort of holding Taehyung up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m weird,\u201d Taehyung said, voice shaking more than Jungkook\u2019s. \nJungkook lay him gently on his bed, leaned down and kissed him again. \u201cIt\u2019s cute, Tae. Don\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019re weird but I really like that.\u201d Taehyung fidgeted as Jungkook pushed his shirt further and further up his chest, choking and moaning with every touch of tongue. Jungkook reached a nipple and Taehyung arched up off the bed into his mouth, searing pleasure pulsing down into his dick, and he wondered if he could come in his pants right here under Jungkook\u2019s mouth. His thighs tensed together anxiously, struggling for friction.\n\u201cPlease.\u201d He felt like he\u2019d been laid out on an alter, body arching and twitching against Jungkook\u2019s lips as he stood over him. \n\u201cTae, you have no idea how pretty you are, do you?\u201d\nTaehyung\u2019s brain had already shut down all its processing skills. \u201cHuh? Ah!\u201d\nJungkook\u2019s lovely lips popped off Taehyung\u2019s nipple. \u201cYou\u2019re the best part of that fucking class, you know. You\u2019re so gorgeous,\u201d Jungkook\u2019s mouth found his again. Taehyung mumbled wordlessly against his lips, hands coming up to cover his face and stop the room from spinning. \u201cAnd so fucking cute,\u201d Jungkook giggled, kissing his forehead.\nJungkook drew away, and Taehyung heard some loud clunking, like heavy boots hitting the floor, and then Jungkook climbed up onto the bed over him. \u201cTae.\u201d\nTaehyung took his hands off his face and found Jungkook\u2019s toothy smile hovering above him. \n\u201cAnd you\u2019re so funny. I can\u2019t take naps in that class because I don\u2019t want to miss you doing something weird.\u201d\nReally? This beautiful man had been eyeing him all semester? And he hadn\u2019t noticed? \u201cJungkook,\u201d Taehyung said, voice already raspy, \u201cHave you had a crush on me all semester? And you never said anything?\u201d\nJungkook snuggled down against his chest, weight heavy and tantalizing down on his hips, across his chest, crushing him into the mattress. Taehyung looked down his chest at Jungkook\u2019s happy face. \u201cI\u2019m actually pretty shy, especially about approaching guys, and you\u2019re a hot, smart upperclassman with lots of friends. So no. I wasn\u2019t going to say anything. But then the group project happened and even though I freaked you out, you seemed so turned on, so I figured it might happen if I hadn\u2019t accidentally hurt you. I was really worried.\u201d\nTaehyung buried his hands in Jungkook\u2019s hair, who smiled bashfully. \u201cJungkookie, you\u2019re fantastic.\u201d\nJungkook\u2019s low hum rattled against Taehyung\u2019s chest, and he scooted back up, body propped over his, and pressed his lips back to Taehyung\u2019s. \u201cCan I take you on a date after this?\u201d\n\u201cFuck yes. You\u2019re so hot.\u201d\n\u201cGlad you think so.\u201d He shifted uneasily on top of Taehyung. \u201cI don\u2019t want to force this too fast. Should we stop?\u201d\nTaehyung\u2019s dick needed way too much attention. He hadn\u2019t had sex since the first month of freshman year. Jungkook was too close and too warm. \u201cNo, no. Please fuck me.\u201d\nJungkook huffed, a little surprised. \u201cYeah. Hell yeah. How do you want this?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. Take charge.\u201d\nJungkook\u2019s gaze turned just a little evil. He sat up over Taehyung\u2019s hips and unbuttoned his shirt, let it slip slowly down his arms. His chest came into view, a vacuum-packed, flat, even six-pack, trim waist, solid pecs, sculpted shoulders, the most mouth-watering dream of a body Taehyung had ever seen up close. He flexed proudly. \u201cFigured you\u2019d like this.\u201d Taehyung moaned before he could help himself, just a soft, breathy sound that he couldn\u2019t control. Jungkook chuckled.\n\u201cUgh, who even are you, showing up in my room with those,\u201d Taehyung groaned, grabbing for his abs and only reaching the tops of his thighs, fingers brushing lightly at his jeans. Jungkook smiled and slid even further away, lowering himself over Taehyung\u2019s bared chest and kissing down the center line, over his navel.\n\u201cNo, no, please come back.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so skinny, Tae.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t eat enough,\u201d he breathed back, \u201cI never have time.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s no good,\u201d Jungkook said, mouthing at the sensitive spot beside the crease of his hip that made Taehyung squeeze his knees together and squirm, eyes shutting tight. \u201cI\u2019ll have to feed you.\u201d He pulled down Taehyung\u2019s jeans as if expecting them to slip right over his slim hips with no resistance. \nThe harsh denim scraped over entirely too many inches of bare skin and Taehyung remembered, at the last second, the lilac panties. He had time to suck in a breath through his teeth, and then he felt cool air on his thighs, and his hands were back over his face, and Jungkook sat there for a moment, frozen. Taehyung heard him suck in a breath through his nose and then blow it all out in a whoosh. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d \nTaehyung\u2019s entire body felt red-hot, heart pounding with shame, legs trying to pull out from under Jungkook so he could hide himself, and then Jungkook\u2019s thumbs stroked down the dips on either side of his dick, and Taehyung realized his arousal had only spiked, dick painfully hard, as sensitive as if Jungkook already had him down his throat. Taehyung felt soft breath through the silk, then the gentle press of lips to the head, and his back and thighs tensed painfully as he reflexively tried to force closer. \u201cThis is fucking me up, Taehyung,\u201d Jungkook murmured. \u201cHoly fuck, do you shave your legs?\u201d\nTaehyung could only grunt back, the swirling shame intensifying. Taehyung wondered if anyone had ever passed out from embarrassment.\n\u201cIs this why you wear long pants all the fucking time? Do you like being feminine?\u201d\nTaehyung giggled, and forced out, through the lock in his throat, \u201cGirls are pretty. I like being pretty.\u201d\nJungkook honest-to-god snuggled up to his dick, rubbing his cheek against the soft silk, and Taehyung\u2019s thighs tensed again, breath fast and rough in his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Taehyung squeaked.\nJungkook hummed and traced his thumb around Taehyung\u2019s dick through the silk, the lightest tease, and his whole body seemed to vibrate. Jungkook sat up and pulled his pants the rest of the way off, then rested one of Taehyung\u2019s bare legs over his shoulder and kissed gently down it, hand running so softly over his smooth, waxed skin, and Taehyung stared, arms still tight over his chest, hands over his face, the back of his thigh against the hard angles of Jungkook\u2019s chest, which he still needed to touch. \n\u201cJeez,\u201d he muttered, \u201cJungkook, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\nJungkook bit the inside of his knee gently, and Taehyung\u2019s dick twinged nearly painfully with arousal. He gasped and rubbed it. Jungkook gently shoved the hand off. \u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he ran a hand down his thigh, \u201cwhat you do to me. Don\u2019t touch yourself; that\u2019s my job.\u201d Taehyung scoffed weakly, but tangled his hands in the sheets anyway to make sure he didn\u2019t. \u201cGood boy,\u201d Jungkook murmured. \n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna kill me,\u201d Taehyung whined.\nJungkook smiled. So many white teeth. His hands were back on the silk panties, thumbs stroking thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out what to do with you.\u201d\n\u201cPlease hurry. Everything you say makes my dick hurt.\u201d \nJungkook smiled. \u201cRule number one: Hands stay above your shoulders, no matter which position we\u2019re in, got it?\u201d \n\u201cRules?\u201d Taehyung said, hands raising slowly over his head, eyebrows screwed up in confusion. \n\u201cGood boy,\u201d Jungkook murmured again, and a moan crackled out of Taehyung\u2019s throat again. He was beginning to sweat from the force of his full-bodied blush.\n\u201cAny more rules?\u201d he asked, voice trembling, remembering what people had wanted from him in the past. \u201cShould I not talk?\u201d\nJungkook shook his head. \u201cPlease talk all you want. I love it when you talk. You have a beautiful voice and you say funny things.\u201d\nTaehyung felt one of the nervous knots in his stomach unravel. \u201cYou really know how to seduce a man. Keep the compliments coming.\u201d\n\u201cYou look beautiful with your hair off your forehead.\u201d\nTaehyung looked up like he could actually see his forehead, straining his head backwards against the pillow and then stopped and pouted, embarrassed. Jungkook giggled at him. \n\u201cYou\u2019re so cute.\u201d\nTaehyung hesitated, determined that his face did, in fact, count as being above his shoulders, and then hid his face in his hands.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna add your face to that rule,\" Jungkook said, tugging his hands away. \"Don\u2019t cover your pretty face.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you going to do if I break the rule?\u201d\nJungkook smirked. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Make you wait longer? Do you ever wear those panties around during the day?\u201d\nTaehyung sucked in a breath and shook his head. Even now, the smooth, cool feeling kept a constant stir of sexy down on his skin. He couldn\u2019t help but get hard with that feeling. He\u2019d never dared wear them while out in public.\n\u201cOkay. You don\u2019t follow my rules, and you\u2019re wearing them to class.\u201d\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Taehyung said, voice strained and high. \nA giant grin split Jungkook\u2019s face. \u201cFuck, you\u2019re so cute!\u201d He fell on him, wrapping his arms around Taehyung\u2019s chest and nuzzling into his neck. Taehyung giggled in surprise and wrapped his arms around Jungkook\u2019s head to hold him there. It took everything he had not to bring his hands below his shoulders to feel all up Jungkook\u2019s torso. He could at least kind of grind up against Jungkook\u2019s crotch in tiny, tiny jerks of his hips, silk catching on denim. He gritted his teeth and whined. \n\u201cOkay, baby. I got you.\u201d Jungkook sat up and tugged Taehyung\u2019s shirt the rest of the way off, and then kissed over his shoulders, sucked marks into his neck, bit his ears, hands stroking warm and just on the breathtaking side of ticklish over his narrow sides. His big hands covered so much, thumbs parallel to his fingers on both sides of his body. Taehyung felt small and trapped, hands flopped helplessly onto the pillow, twitching fitfully, tiny, quick moans falling from his lips, and Jungkook would not let up. \n\u201cPlease, please, please, please, please\u2014\u201d\nJungkook giggled quietly. \u201cSo responsive,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been,\u201d he broke off to moan desperately when Jungkook flicked his tongue over a nipple, \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since anyone touched me.\u201d \nJungkook finally sat up and looked Taehyung in the face. \u201cHow do people keep their hands off you?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really make myself available,\u201d Taehyung said, \u201cPeople grab me in clubs sometimes. I\u2019ve fooled around a bit, but it never feels like this.\u201d\nJungkook hugged him around the waist and pulled him upright in his lap as if he weighed nothing, and that swirled right down into Taehyung\u2019s dick. Precome stuck to his stomach. His hands hovered cautiously in the air on either side of his head. \u201cYou can touch me, you know,\u201d Jungkook said. Taehyung put his arms carefully on Jungkook\u2019s defined shoulders, traps wide under his palms, and then ran his shaky fingers up into his dark hair. Jungkook\u2019s eyes slipped closed, broad hands still on Taehyung\u2019s hips. He smiled softly as Taehyung scratched his scalp. \n\u201cYour lips curl at the corners when you smile,\u201d Taehyung said. \n\u201cMy friends call me bunny,\u201d Jungkook said, opening his eyes, round and dark and sparkly, \u201cBecause of my teeth.\u201d \nTaehyung\u2019s mind shorted out a little. \u201cOh god, please fuck me.\u201d\n\u201cYou got lube?\u201d \n\u201cUnder\u2014um. It\u2019s\u2026well,\u201d tingling embarrassment burned up through his chest again. His voice got very soft. \u201cIt\u2019s under my pillow.\u201d\nJungkook raised an eyebrow, leaned down, one arm clutching Taehyung easily to his chest, and grabbed the bottle, nearly empty, out from under the pillow. \u201cDo you use toys or fingers?\u201d\nTaehyung felt like he might die. \u201cFingers usually. Vibrator takes too much effort to clean.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook said, and leaned up to tug Taehyung\u2019s lip out from between his teeth with his own mouth. \u201cAnd you keep everything under your pillow?\u201d\nHe nodded. Jungkook lightly pinched the head of his neglected, sensitized cock through the silk. \u201cStop worrying about it. You\u2019re fine. That\u2019s sexy as hell.\u201d He pulled the hem of Taehyung\u2019s panties off his cock so he could massage the head, and Taehyung moaned happily. Jungkook\u2019s eyes fluttered away from Taehyung\u2019s, drifting closed. \u201cYou\u2019re soft, Tae,\u201d he murmured.\n\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m taking these off,\u201d Jungkook said, lowering Taehyung back onto the bed and stripping the panties straight up off his long legs. Taehyung watched the silk travel slowly up his smooth skin, and then it was just Jungkook\u2019s denim against the skin of his ass, Jungkook\u2019s strong chest braced against his thighs again. Taehyung felt very light-headed. \n\u201cHoly fuck, you wax?\u201d Jungkook said breathlessly, thumb tracing around the hairless base of his dick, the smooth skin around his balls. He almost covered his face, remembered the rule, and let his arms flop around fretfully down beside his head. He needed to come so bad. His brain asked if he might have a humiliation kink, and he made a small noise of frustration and horror. \nThe lube popped open, and Taehyung got a Pavlovian rush of need into his already hyper-sensitive dick. \u201cPlease make me feel good,\u201d he whined.\n\u201cDon\u2019t just say shit like that,\u201d Jungkook murmured in awe. Taehyung felt a line of sweat drip down his neck. \u201cSpread your legs, babe.\u201d\nTaehyung dropped his knees wide open and pulled them up, baring himself completely, open, soft, and vulnerable, everything he hid laid out for Jungkook to do whatever with, and he\u2019d never let himself be this open for anyone before, had never had someone ask for it. Jungkook shifted back on the sheets and pushed one finger, easy as anything, up into him. \u201cYou\u2019re loose. You do this a lot?\u201d\n\u201cDid it last night,\u201d Taehyung whimpered, \u201cMore, please.\u201d \nJungkook pressed his lips to the head of Taehyung\u2019s cock, pink tongue poking out and flicking under the crown. He slid in a second finger and curled them deep and hard, hooking right against his sweet spot like it wasn\u2019t a big deal, like Taehyung didn\u2019t fight for every brush whenever he fucked himself on his long fingers, like he didn\u2019t struggle to find the right angle over his vibrator every fucking time. A deep, desperate, startled, loud moan ripped out of Taehyung\u2019s chest. Jungkook hummed in satisfaction, and Taehyung grabbed the headboard so he didn\u2019t reach down and grab his hair. \n\u201cGood boy,\u201d Jungkook said again, lilting and pleased. His fingers circled harsh and slow, and pleasure bloomed heavy between his ass and the base of his dick, building quickly. Taehyung whimpered so loud he was sure the room next door could hear him. \nJungkook started sucking lightly, fingers thrusting slowly, sliding heavily along his prostate, and Taehyung moaned with each press, sensitivity dialed up to ten and pressing closer and closer to coming. \u201cAre you sure I\u2019m not hurting you?\u201d Jungkook asked after a little while, voice squeaky.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m better with girls. If it hurts, just tell me.\u201d\n\u201cWha\u2014why would it hurt?\u201d\n\u201cYou look like you\u2019re in pain. It sounds like it hurts.\u201d\n\u201cFeels so good, Jungkook it feels so good. Nobody\u2019s done this to me since some guy freshman year, and that felt awful and he was such a shit afterwards and I haven\u2019t done it since. I\u2019ve just been really unlucky until right now and my head\u2019s, like, fucked up, and I\u2019m oversharing. I\u2019m sorry. Why\u2019d you stop? Please keep going.\u201d \n\u201cTae?\u201d He sat up a little, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d His fingers were still tight against his prostate inside him, a dull pressure keeping him desperate and wanting. \n\u201cPlease, Jungkook, please, please, I need it. Stop fucking teasing just\u2014\u201d Jungkook pulled out and shoved three fingers back in, Taehyung\u2019s words broke on a deep, shuddering gasp. \n\u201cPretty Tae. So pretty,\u201d Jungkook whispered, fingers brutal over his prostate, lips soft and light against his thigh. The pressure built and built, aching heat and intensity, halfway to pain, overwhelming and beautiful and too good. Jungkook\u2019s tongue travelled down the crease of his thigh, across his hairless skin, nipping and sucking. The pleasure rushed, a severe extra feel-good tension, and then Jungkook\u2019s mouth met his balls, his fingers flicked fast inside him, and Taehyung felt the tell-tale switch from tension to incredible pleasure. \nHis eyes snapped open. \u201cKook! Coming! Fuck!\u201d Jungkook blinked up in surprise as Taehyung thrashed and came weakly over his stomach. Taehyung wondered if his skin would cook itself under his blush, if his lips would crack from his shame.\n\u201cWow.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t warn you. I\u2019ve never come from that before. I didn\u2019t know that would happen.\u201d\n\u201cLike, from just something in your ass?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nJungkook flicked his hair out of his eyes, blinking off into Taehyung\u2019s room for a minute, thinking. \u201cWe can stop, if you want.\u201d\n\u201cGive-give me a minute. I don\u2019t want to leave you hanging.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d Jungkook said, sitting up. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get some water. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He cleaned him up first with the tissues conveniently placed beside his bed. \u201cYou can move your hands down for now if you want,\u201d he said, scratching the back of his neck shyly. \n\u201cYou\u2019re so cute,\u201d Taehyung whined. \u201cYou\u2019re a freshman, right?\u201d He nodded. \u201cOh my god. Adorable. Eighteen? Nineteen?\u201d\nHe looked flustered, like he didn\u2019t know what to do with being called adorable. \u201cJust turned nineteen.\u201d \n\u201cUgh. Cutie,\u201d Taehyung said. He still hadn\u2019t taken his hands down from over his head. \u201cWater!\u201d\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019m going.\u201d He grabbed a cup off Taehyung\u2019s desk, smell-checked it, and then walked out into the hallway still shirtless. Whoever was walking down the hallway needed to be grateful.\nWhen he came back, Taehyung had stretched out on his stomach on the bed, head lying on his arms. \u201cCan I suck you off?\u201d He asked before Jungkook had even closed the door. \nJungkook\u2019s eyes widened, cheeks flushing as he stared. \u201cOf course. Anything you want.\u201d\n\u201cOh I could get used to that,\u201d Taehyung murmured. Jungkook looked quietly pleased with himself. \nHe handed Taehyung the water and watched him drink it, eyes on Taehyung\u2019s neck when he swallowed. He unbuckled his belt, eyeing Taehyung down through his eyelashes, brows harsh, jaw set, pecs flexing slightly as he pulled his belt open. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Taehyung asked, \u201cDinner and a show?\u201d\nJungkook grinned and let his pants fall down his long legs, his wide, solid, thighs. His dark blue briefs fit snugly around his hips, clung to every inch of his cock. Taehyung grabbed one thigh and dragged him closer, hoping Jungkook didn\u2019t feel the way he was shaking. His palm ran stutteringly up Jungkook\u2019s firm ass and then around from to pet his washboard abs, smooth, soft hills under his fingers. \u201cWill you pick me up again, sexy?\u201d he murmured, face hidden shyly in Jungkook\u2019s hip, lips half an inch from his dick, glancing sideways through his lashes to see Jungkook\u2019s shell-shocked face.\n\u201cRight now?\u201d\n\u201cWhenever its convenient,\u201d Taehyung said, and kissed him through his briefs. \u201cMm, you fill these out.\u201d \n\u201cFuck,\u201d Jungkook murmured. \u201cHow do you keep getting sexier?\u201d \nTaehyung smiled happily against his crotch and then tugged him into bed. \u201cHands above my head now?\u201d \n\u201cSure.\u201d\nTaehyung left his hands on Jungkook\u2019s hips and scooted down to keep mouthing at Jungkook\u2019s dick, tongue tracing teasing patterns over the fabric. Jungkook huffed and stripped his underwear off himself. \u201cAw, you\u2019re no fun,\u201d Taehyung murmured, and swept his tongue up Jungkook\u2019s dick to lick heavily around the head, and then immediately swallowed him down as far as he could. \nJungkook\u2019s thighs tensed. Taehyung flattened his palms as a warning, but his thin forearms looked frail next to those thick, thick thighs. If Jungkook\u2019s hips decided they were going somewhere, Taehyung would just have to choke. He shivered a little, bobbing more slowly now, hands wrapping under Jungkook\u2019s thighs to grab his butt, deliciously firm. Taehyung wanted to bite it.\nTaehyung hadn\u2019t had any real, intimate, bedroom sex in the past two years, but he\u2019d done this more than a few times, found some guy in a party late at night, gay, bi, or just plain curious, and gotten on his knees in the bathroom, in some stranger\u2019s dark bedroom, behind the science building halfway home, staring up from under his bangs, letting them grab and manhandle and moan, and he\u2019d fall asleep warm and excited that night knowing he was pretty enough, good enough to drive someone crazy.\nJungkook sounded crazy enough. Even from his angle, Taehyung could see two white teeth under his upper lip, see the twitch in his arms, his hard pecs and perky nipples. \u201cYou look like someone drew you,\u201d Taehyung murmured.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jungkook gasped, hands grasping Taehyung\u2019s shoulders.\n\u201cYou look too perfect to be real. Did someone make you out of marble and bring you to life?\u201d Jungkook breathed deep, chest swelling with air, muscles stretched like a canvas over his ribs. Taehyung sucked him down and his hands tightened on his shoulders, whining with every breath. \u201cWant you to fuck me,\u201d Taehyung whispered the next time he came up for air, cheeks burning, unable to look up to meet Jungkook\u2019s eyes. \nJungkook moaned. \u201cHow the hell did I get here?\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cSorry. I\u2019m in shock. Ignore me. This is so good.\u201d \nTaehyung giggled around Jungkook\u2019s dick and worked it lower, brows furrowing as he gulped and opened his throat, humming slightly to ground himself. Jungkook\u2019s back arched beautifully, breath labored, every beautiful swell in his torso in sharp relief. The hands on his shoulders never pressured him, just tightened when he tensed and scratched soothingly. \n\u201cI\u2019m gonna make you come again,\u201d he said when Taehyung took a break to tease and his back had flattened out on the sheets so he could breath. \n\u201cYou better,\u201d Taehyung said, and flinched at his gravelly voice, way too low and rough. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cSorry why?\u201d \n\u201cVoice.\u201d He played with the crown, tongue flicking, lips squeezing. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your voice? You sound so hot.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s so low though,\u201d Taehyung said, and couldn\u2019t keep the self-conscious whine out, just a little bit hurt. He pulled away, eyes stuck on Jungkook\u2019s abs, and Jungkook sat up, grabbed him under the arms, and hauled him easily up to lie across his chest, like lifting a baby. Taehyung\u2019s dick twitched hard against the crease of Jungkook\u2019s hip. \n\u201cYour voice is so beautiful, especially like this. It doesn\u2019t need to be high to be pretty. I love listening when you talk.\u201d\n\u201cThe first guy I was with in high school covered my mouth halfway through sex because he wanted me to shut up,\u201d Taehyung blurted. Jungkook\u2019s entire face twitched in shock, mouth comically struggling to form words. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cFuck, Tae. Don\u2019t apologize to me.\u201d\nTaehyung dropped his head onto Jungkook\u2019s shoulder, embarrassed. \u201cI just wrecked the mood. I\u2019m sorry. Please keep going.\u201d\n\u201cYour voice is beautiful though.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t think so,\u201d Taehyung muttered, \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t like the way I kept talking or something. Said I said really stupid shit.\u201d His stomach burned from embarrassment, and not the sexy kind. \u201cI\u2019m destroying the mood. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cTae, if I were any happier to be even talking to you, I\u2019d probably actually get high off it. There\u2019s pretty much nothing you could do to make me uncomfortable at this point. I\u2019m here for you. If you want to quit sex right now and talk about, I don\u2019t know, diarrhea or something, it will still be the best day of my college career so far. Except maybe midnight taco night.\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking of diarrhea,\u201d Taehyung giggled, \u201cI fucking LOVE midnight taco night,\u201d which was the easiest way around dealing with how wildly his heart was pounding, giddy, pleased giggles fighting their way out of his chest.\n\u201cYou\u2019re on par with midnight taco night. Even just being in your room, talking to you with your sexy blowjob voice, is on par with midnight taco night.\u201d\n\u201cWell then imagine how much actually fucking me is going to blow midnight taco night out of the fucking water,\u201d Taehyung said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re still up for that?\u201d\nTaehyung ground his rock hard dick into Jungkook\u2019s hip and moaned loud and low, pure relief and need.\n\u201cYeah yeah,\u201d Jungkook breathed. \u201cOkay. Hands still over your shoulders? Good.\u201d He sat up, grabbed the lube up off the blankets, and then resettled up against the wall, Taehyung\u2019s knees spread across his waist. Taehyung braced his hands against the wall to keep them up, and Jungkook dumped lube all over his fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty stretched, right?\u201d\nTaehyung nodded. He felt Jungkook\u2019s wet fingers brushing around his hole and arched, knees spreading slightly, head falling back, forcing himself to relax. The fingers sank into him, stretching hot and heavy, walls opening. He stayed deep for a minute, fingers stroking unerringly over his prostate, lighting sparks up into his stomach again. \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d Taehyung gasped. \u201cI can\u2019t ever find it.\u201d\n\u201cGood angle,\u201d Jungkook said. \u201cPractice. I\u2019m even better with girls. You could practice on me sometime, if you want.\u201d Just the thought of fingering Jungkook sent Taehyung into another round of wild shudders. Jungkook\u2019s free hand stroked soothingly along the gentle curve of Taehyung\u2019s waist, thumb pressing gently into the small swell of his tummy. His fingers drew out and then came back with three, and Taehyung groaned, arms tense against the wall. \n\u201cDo you like girls more?\u201d Taehyung said when he could breath.\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Jungkook said, \u201cI really like you.\u201d\n\u201cAm I pretty like a girl?\u201d Taehyung asked, and flushed at that question in his way too deep voice.\n\u201cYou\u2019re boyish,\u201d Jungkook said, fingers thrusting easily in straightforward pushes that had Taehyung\u2019s mouth hanging open, soft moans bouncing out of him, high in his mouth with every press. \u201cAnd feminine. Yeah. You look so good in panties. Could I put you in full lingerie sometime?\u201d\n\u201cOh god yes,\u201d Taehyung murmured. \u201cI\u2019m way too shy to buy that on my own though.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019d you get those panties?\u201d\n\u201cOrdered them online.\u201d\nJungkook\u2019s strokes were changing, speed constant, but the pressure became more intense, hard and present, prostate near stinging with oversensitivity. Taehyung realized he was curling his fingers, drawing wide spirals inside him. When he looked down, he could see the entire span of Jungkook\u2019s body fit between his legs, a little less defined with how he hunched against the headboard, but the forearms between his legs bulged, veins running along the surface.\n\u201cSo good at this,\u201d Taehyung said, hoping he didn\u2019t drool right on Jungkook\u2019s chest.\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\nTaehyung\u2019s hips were working on their own now, shy little twitches against Jungkook\u2019s hand, and he slowed, made Taehyung chase it. \u201cPlease,\u201d Taehyung whispered, staring down at the bulge in the front of his briefs, stretching the fabric out. His dick throbbed. \u201cGet your goddamn cock out.\u201d \n\u201cBe nice. He\u2019s shy.\u201d\nTaehyung groaned and bounced faster. \n\u201cOh shit. Condom,\u201d Jungkook said.\n\u201cI will ride you bare at this point,\u201d Taehyung said.\n\u201cNo way.\u201d\n\u201cSecond drawer down on my dresser. You should be able to reach one.\u201d \nJungkook took his hand away entirely, still dripping with lube, and yanked the dresser drawer open. The box sat just near enough for Jungkook to grab, and Taehyung sat and twitched fitfully, aching and clenching and cold. Jungkook managed to yank his briefs off, and his dick, red and hard, bounced against his stomach. He slid the condom on as Taehyung squirmed, and then looked up for permission. Taehyung answered by trying, with determination, to sit on it.\n\u201cOkay, okay! Jeez! Hold still!\u201d Jungkook, with one large hand gripping his hip and the other on his own dick, guided Taehyung down onto the tip, and then grabbed him by the hips and pulled him irresistibly down. \nJungkook\u2019s dick wasn\u2019t even as big as the biggest thing Taehyung had ever shoved up his ass, but the stretch had him gasping with the lingering oversensitivity, the sheer warmth and give to it, the way he didn\u2019t control what it did to him. He couldn\u2019t even move. Jungkook\u2019s hands trapped him, vice-like on his slim hips, so he couldn\u2019t get away from feeling ever inch sink steadily in. He tried to open his eyes. Below him, Jungkook\u2019s arched again the headboard, throat bared, stare deadly sexy, focused and hungry like a snake. Taehyung\u2019s eyes slammed shut again. \u201cCareful. Don\u2019t hurt me,\u201d he whispered.\n\u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d He moved Taehyung\u2019s hips in tiny circles on his dick, fingers digging into his skin, only a thin layer of padding between that and bones, hands covering so much space. His hand twitched against the wall and almost went down and grabbed his dick, but didn\u2019t. Jungkook kept up the slow circles. He pressed against his walls and stretched his hole in the most achingly delicious way, the tingling pulse from his first orgasm still a soft edge in the pleasure in his dick now.\n\u201cOh, god,\u201d Taehyung whispered, \u201cThis is so\u2026it\u2019s so\u2014ah!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this very often?\u201d Jungkook murmured. \n\u201cNot since freshman year,\u201d Teahyung gasped. \u201cSome guy I really liked found me at a party. He fucked me on the railroad tracks on the walk home.\u201d Jungkook slowed so he could speak. \u201cNot enough lube. Scared of trains. Rocks and splinters everywhere. Talk about bad at sex. He was pathetic.\u201d\nJungkook laughed. \u201cThat sounds awful.\u201d\n\u201cIt was,\u201d Taehyung said, snickering. \u201cHe sucked! And then he wouldn\u2019t text me back. Made fun of me in public whenever I was around. Bragged to his friends. Told people things about me. Couldn\u2019t look anyone in the eye for weeks.\u201d He trailed off, realizing that the dick in his ass had gone completely still. Jungkook had that shocked, horrified look on his face again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That wrecked the mood again, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cFuck the mood. Are you okay? Is that why you don\u2019t hook up with people often?\u201d\nTaehyung sighed and used the moment to shift on his knees, resettle the weight a little. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m still bitter about it, obviously, but I\u2019ve worked through it. It\u2019s the reason I usually don\u2019t let people in quickly anymore. Can you keep fucking me?\u201d\nJungkook blinked at him for a moment, obviously gauging if he should continue. \u201cI\u2019m different?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so hot I don\u2019t care,\u201d Taehyung murmured, and then backtracked when Jungkook looked a little hurt. \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling lonely. You don\u2019t give off the same vibe. You\u2019ve been so sweet. I trust you.\u201d\nJungkook gave him an absolutely dazzling smile. \u201cHang onto my shoulders.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d He grabbed Jungkook\u2019s shoulders. Jungkook wrapped his arms around Taehyung\u2019s lower back and sat up straight, dick jamming hard inside him. After a little bit of graceful scrambling, Taehyung\u2019s back hit the wall, Jungkook\u2019s carrying him a couple feet up off the bed with his arms under his knees, dick still inside him. Jungkook shifted his knees on the sheets and adjusted his arms, jostling Taehyung\u2019s legs, and Taehyung realized he was about to get fucked against the wall.\nHe gasped at the same moment Jungkook began pumping his hips again, the new position driving him in so much deeper. Jungkook held him up against the wall because he could, strong arms locked under his legs, his weight pinning him down, open, trapped, taken, and so warm and wanted. \u201cMore, more, please, Kookie, please!\u201d\nJungkook breathed raggedly in his ear, hips working in smooth, tight circles that punched his dick in deep, sliding hard over his swollen prostate. Jungkook had his entire body weight trapped between his arms and the wall, carrying him like a toy, spread out and willing. Moans ripped out of his chest with every hard thrust, rattling hard against the inside of his ribcage, but he couldn\u2019t hear them over the blood rushing in his ears. \nJungkook murmured right into his ear and he didn\u2019t bother understanding, too focused on the intense ache pulsing into him, the pleasure burning up his dick. Taehyung\u2019s head jerked back and hit the wall. His dick brushed against Jungkook\u2019s abs with every thrust, back stuck with friction, bed rocking, body taught and twitching. His hair trailed into his eyes. \n\u201c\u2026beautiful. You\u2019re so beautiful. Tae, you should see yourself.\u201d\n\u201cJungkook!\u201d he sobbed.\n\u201cBaby? Princess? You good?\u201d\n\u201cCan you\u2026harder?\u201d he squeaked. Jungkook grunted and hiked him further up, arms bulging as he lifted. Taehyung yelled in pained happiness as his back scraped up the wall and his thighs stretched over Jungkook\u2019s arms. Jungkook had room to really pump now, longer, faster strokes slamming in, tantalizingly close to his prostate, just a teasing note with the fullness keeping him breathless and writhing. Taehyung\u2019s hands dug harshly into his hard shoulders. \nTaehyung swore he was getting altitude dizziness, breath coming short, arousal stinging from oversensitivity. He loved the right-after too-much feeling of post-orgasm, often kept his vibrator in a bit to long, kept playing with his dick as much as he could stand to as it softened, but had never been able to force himself into fighting past it and just torture himself like this, but it felt so absurdly good to have someone else do it.\n\u201cCan you come for me, baby?\u201d\n\u201cCame earlier,\u201d Taehyung gasped. \u201c\u2019S hard. Hands? Can I-hah! Fuck. Use my hands?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jungkook growled. \n\u201cAh, fuck you.\u201d Taehyung squirmed, trying to bounce back down on his dick, make it harder and faster. His thighs hurt too much. His abs scrunched uncomfortably, Jungkook still in total control of his body, and damn if that didn\u2019t feel even better. \u201cCan\u2019t. Kookie, please. Please!\u201d\nJungkook lifted him off the wall, hands on his lower back, and tipped them carefully back onto the bed, Taehyung\u2019s dizzy head on the pillow as Jungkook\u2019s arms flexed and took his weight. He kept Taehyung\u2019s ass tipped up on his lap, legs hooked over his shoulders, low and close enough to drip sweat onto his chest. Taehyung shivered.\nHe could pound in even harder now, all his weight thrown into a machine-steady rhythm. Taehyung\u2019s hands flopped on the pillow beside his head, and Jungkook grabbed him by the wrists and held him down. The world became aching thighs, bruising wrists, electric tightness deep between his hips, the desperate pleasure in his dick, consuming and good, painful and wonderful, black and soundless. Jungkook said something, voice vibrating along his neck where his lips were pressed. Taehyung didn\u2019t hear. \nThe punching pleasure in his gut faltered, pressure squeezed his painful wrists, and then became still, a slight twitching and pulsing warmth inside him. Taehyung remembered where he was and opened his eyes. Tears blurred his vision. Jungkook was still, head down on Taehyung\u2019s chest, hands loosening around his wrists. \u201cYou came?\u201d Taehyung whispered.\nJungkook nodded. \u201cSorry. Gonna pull out in just a minute.\u201d\n\u201cStay in me, please. Feels so good.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t make you come like that.\u201d \nTaehyung whined. \u201cJust give me a handie or something.\u201d\nJungkook shook his head and slowly pulled out, sitting up sluggishly and letting Taehyung\u2019s legs down. His hips popped painfully, over-stretched hips sharply sore, distracting him from the clenching, shuddering emptiness between his legs. He growled out a crackly, monotone, annoyed note of pain.\nJungkook giggled. \u201cShh, I got you.\u201d He continued to slowly stretch Taehyung\u2019s achy legs out, lowering his mouth to Taehyung\u2019s cock, sticky and weeping with precome. Taehyung gripped the pillow, wrists still stinging pleasantly. Jungkook massaged the crease of his hips for a long minute while nuzzled sweetly up to his cock, kissing gently, each touch sparking wild need into his core.\nTaehyung gasped. \u201cStop teasing. Touch me, please. Fuck, do something. I need something, anything, please more, please, Jungkook don\u2019t you dare do this to me, you ass.\u201d\nJungkook lifted him and turned him easily on his stomach. He pulled his creaking hips up off the mattress, propping his knees up under him, man-handling him like he was made of air. \u201cOh, fuck,\u201d Taehyung wheezed. \n\u201cShh, its okay. I got you,\u201d Jungkook murmured, and Taehyung cut off the deep whine squeezing out of his chest. \nFingers pushed back into him with a soft, wet noise, and Jungkook unerringly pressed into his prostate. Taehyung felt it right up in his teeth. His back bowed hard, trying to move down and away, thighs trembling. Jungkook began a quick, casual circling around his prostate, pressing hard. Taehyung felt his large hand curl around his dick and jerked into it. \n\u201cYou\u2019re drooling all over your pillow,\u201d Jungkook giggled. Taehyung managed to crack his eyes open, still blurry and teary, and glared back at Jungkook as he stuck his tongue out and licked the pillow. \nJungkook snickered and pressed down. Taehyung gasped, eyes slamming shut. His body shuddered. He felt seconds away from coming, the wonderful pressure of Jungkook\u2019s hand fighting the awful intensity on his prostate, but he wasn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t get there yet, and then the hand on his dick let go, and Taehyung\u2019s hips jumped, searching for it. \nJungkook was giggling. He poked Taehyung\u2019s tongue. \u201cBabe, get your tongue back in your mouth.\u201d Taehyung huffed and dragged Jungkook\u2019s fingers closer, tongue flicking between them, drawing swirls along the undersides of his long fingers and into the top of his palm. \u201cFuck,\u201d Jungkook whispered as Taehyung licked faltering patterns all over his palm, matching the slow, sultry pace of the fingers inside him.\n\u201cThat,\u201d Taehyung said, taking his mouth off, \u201cBack on my dick. Now.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so needy,\u201d Jungkook said breathlessly, hand sliding wetly back onto his dick, as ordered, and Taehyung gasped and thrust awkwardly into it with his aching hips. \n\u201cI have a high sex drive and no one to help, so yeah,\u201d Jungkook\u2019s hand began a slow slide, and Taehyung\u2019s words trailed off into a heartfelt whine, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m needy.\u201d\nJungkook softly kissed the dip of his spine. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you, baby. I promise.\u201d And that felt so good with the strong fingers in his ass, the firm grip around his dick, the broad shoulders hovering low over his back. Taehyung hummed happily, wiggling his butt just a little.\nThe fingers inside him finally sped up, breaking apart the last of Taehyung\u2019s self-awareness, blinding pleasure dragging him in and strapping his body down. He felt ready to burst, trembling lines of stinging arousal racing through his body. He could feel his body tightening up, coiling like a spring, struggling to let go, arousal so heavy it hurt.\nHe came like a cork popping, one second an absolute heaven of tension, and the next a wave of sensitivity and pleasure so powerful his vision went white behind his eyes, throat closing. His knees gave, squeezing together and slipping out from under him. Aftershocks shuddered through him. He lay still and let shivers shake through him for a while, dick trapped between his body and Jungkook\u2019s hand pinned to the mattress, fingers still trapped in his ass, the squeezing pressure just what he needed as a come-down. \n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Jungkook asked, voice shaky. Taehyung grunted. \u201cCan I take my hands off?\u201d\n\u201cUh-uh.\u201d\n\u201cTae. I need those.\u201d\nTaehyung pressed his hips down further, and another couple quick shocks of pleasure left him gasping. Jungkook\u2019s fingers twitched involuntarily and Taehyung jerked again. \nThey stayed like that, Jungkook kissing his back, hands carefully still, until Taehyung whined, the oversensitivity getting to be too much, and then he pulled his fingers out quickly, like ripping off the Band-Aid, and lifted Taehyung\u2019s hips up off his other hand. Taehyung rolled onto his side and curled up, getting his breath back. His head spun. The room felt suddenly cold now that he was lying sweaty and still on the sheets.\n\u201cJungkook?\u201d\n\u201cHold on. Finding something to clean up with.\u201d\n\u201cLater. Come back.\u201d\n\u201cI have jizz all over my hand, Tae.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll lick it off,\u201d he whined, \u201cCome back.\u201d\n\u201cGot the tissues.\u201d He heard some dim rustling, getting louder, and realized his hearing had gone out there for a little while. \n\u201cThink I almost fainted,\u201d he muttered as Jungkook\u2019s weight dipped the mattress and a tissue wiped along his jaw and across his lips. \n\u201cYou drooled all over yourself.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, I\u2019m so gross.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re really sexy, actually. Like, holy fuck, I\u2019m semi-hard again and it's only been ten minutes. My dick hurts. You are absolutely shameless.\u201d\nTaehyung cracked his eyes open. \u201cI\u2019m not though. I almost died of embarrassment, like, five times.\u201d He tried to move his legs apart so Jungkook could get at the lube smeared all over him, but Jungkook grabbed it and manhandled him easily.\n\u201cDon\u2019t move. I\u2019ve got it.\u201d\nTaehyung sighed and relaxed, let Jungkook clean him up as he melted sleepily into the bed. \u201cDo you still wanna date me?\u201d he murmured. \n\u201cYeah.\u201d Jungkook said after a moment, turning one of Taehyung\u2019s bruising wrists over in his hand. \u201cDo you still want to date me though?\u201d\nTaehyung opened one eye. \u201cNo way,\u201d Jungkook\u2019s soft lips fell open, sparkly eyes widening in panic. \u201cFuck, don\u2019t make that face. I\u2019m totally kidding.\u201d \nJungkook looked like a cherub when he pouted. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here for sex, you know.\u201d\n\u201cYou can come here for sex any fucking time you want. Holy fuck. I\u2019m never going to be able to use toys again. You\u2019ve ruined me. But on a more serious note, please take me out to dinner. Actually, fuck dinner. Stay in and study with me. Come to the trampoline park with me this weekend. Meet all my friends.\u201d\nJungkook melted in against his side. \u201cI\u2019m going to date the shit out of you, Kim Taehyung.\u201d\n\u201cKiss me,\u201d Taehyung whispered, and Jungkook\u2019s lips pressed onto his immediately, hungry and careful, a hand cupping his jaw. One strong arm slid under his back and drew his entire body up against Jungkook\u2019s. He moaned into the kiss, hands finally, finally running hungrily over Jungkook\u2019s chest. \u201cIt\u2019s so appropriate that I\u2019m doing a project on Hercules with you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not that strong,\u201d Jungkook giggled, \u201cbut thanks. I\u2019ll carry you any time.\u201d"
