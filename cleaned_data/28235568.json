    "text": "Atsumu has hit a new low.\nHe would have thought his low point fell somewhere right around when he hit \u2018post\u2019 on a Grindr bio about liking it rough.\u00a0\nIf not then, then surely the moment where he stood on a freezing street corner, wearing the most hideous yellow and lime green hoodie in existence, to avoid the man he\u2019s fallen for\u2014the man who just reiterated point blank that he doesn\u2019t care who Atsumu fucks,  after being fucked by him\u2014also had to be up there.\nOr... down there? Atsumu doesn\u2019t know.\u00a0\nHowever, in spite of all that, Atsumu manages to top both of those easily the very next morning, naked from the waist down, fisting his own cock with his nose buried in that very same highlighter-yellow sweater. The irony is that the hoodie, frustratingly, barely smells like the object of his affections at all. No, it smells like the extra strength detergent Sakusa uses to double-wash his clothes on the industrial setting or whatever the hell he does to purge his garments of even the faintest whiff of his own scent.\u00a0\nBecause even if the detergent is familiar, it always takes on a completely different smell once Sakusa puts his clothes on. Atsumu knows that it\u2019s not just the fabric, but the scent of Sakusa\u2019s hair, his  sweat \u2014\nAnd it doesn\u2019t smell like  this,  Atsumu thinks angrily. His fingers curl into the collar and yank it downwards, away from his face.\u00a0\nHe throws his head back and strokes himself faster, deciding to concentrate on something else instead of the scent of the hoodie. He moans and brings his free hand up to find the bruise Sakusa sucked into his throat yesterday. It was already dark against his skin before he went to bed last night; this morning it\u2019s been throbbing gently with his pulse, sore even before Atsumu reaches up to press on it and turn it into a deeper sting that makes him squirm.\n \u201cAh\u2026\u201d \u00a0\nFuck, he can\u2019t get enough. Atsumu circles his fingers over the bruised skin, hissing as the pain shifts with his touch, dick jumping in his hand.\nAs he gets close, Atsumu bites his lip, a perverse need to ask permission stuck at the tip of his tongue. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s always so much more satisfying to come after Sakusa  tells him he can. He turns his head into the pillow and tries desperately not to think about how Sakusa would react if Atsumu texted him right now and asked. Sakusa could\u2026 fuck, he could tell Atsumu to edge himself a couple times before going over. Sakusa could make him beg for it.\u00a0\nOr Sakusa could  call him  . Atsumu moans again when he thinks about what he might say, voice a low purr as he instructs Atsumu how to touch himself, or teases him for how needy he is, or calls him a good boy for asking permission to come and tells him to  go ahead, Atsumu, you earned it \u2014\n \u201cShit,\u201d  Atsumu gasps, shooting his free hand down just in time to catch his release in his cupped palm.\nWhen he starts to come down, Atsumu reaches robotically for a tissue to clean his hands as reality crashes back over him. Fuck, he feels gross. And a little guilty. It\u2019s more than likely Sakusa would just reply that he doesn\u2019t care what Atsumu does, or worse, that he never consented to any kind of sexual play outside their scenes and to please not ask him that again.\u00a0\nShit.\nAtsumu yanks the lemon-lime monstrosity off and chucks it in the general direction of his laundry hamper as he stalks towards the bathroom to clean up.\u00a0\nThe restless feeling only worsens when Atsumu is faced with the prospect of climbing into Sakusa\u2019s car only an hour later. His own car is still over at his apartment from the night before. They had a prearranged plan for Sakusa to pick Atsumu up for practice, so it\u2019s not like he can avoid him.\u00a0\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Sakusa greets him as Atsumu settles into the leather seat.\u00a0\n\u201cMornin\u2019.\u201d\u00a0\nAtsumu takes a deep breath and resists the urge to yell in frustration when his head is filled with the exact, unique scent that he\u2019d failed to find on the club hoodie he\u2019d embarrassed himself with that morning.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you feeling alright?\u201d Sakusa asks as they roll onto the street. \u201cChest okay?\u201d\nAtsumu can\u2019t restrain his smart mouth as he leans against the car door, \u201cNo lasting damage from yer nip-obliterating clamps, no. I looked those up last night, by the way. Ya sure didn\u2019t hold back, didja?\u201d\nSakusa snorts.\u00a0\n\u201cSomeone with your affection for pain would have found clamps for beginners to be nothing more than temporary nipple jewelry,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cThat\u2019s boring.\u201d\nAtsumu chuckles in spite of himself. \u201cYou really are an asshole, ya know that, Omi-kun?\u201d\nSakusa continues to grin, self-satisfied, under his mask.\n\u201cMight have heard that, once or twice,\u201d he murmurs.\u00a0\n Gosh,  Atsumu likes him. He likes  this  , what they have. It\u2019s in casual moments like this that he realizes what was once played-up but genuine animosity between them has turned into a real friendship. It\u2019s not that he used to  dislike  being around Sakusa, but most of the enjoyment he previously drew from it was a direct result of them butting heads. At the absolute most he would have called them frenemies.\u00a0\nNow\u2026 while they still talk a lot of shit, it\u2019s  different.  It shouldn\u2019t be shocking. They\u2019ve spent a lot of time together; of course they\u2019d get more comfortable with one another. He just didn\u2019t expect to like what he found behind Sakusa\u2019s prickly exterior so much.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s even this sweet or different dude once you get to know him. Behind his hard jerk walls there\u2019s really just a soft jerk center\u2014but the soft part makes Atsumu\u2019s gut twist and flutter. The times when Sakusa smiles or laughs, a quiet and understated thing, Atsumu finds himself cherishing those moments. While he\u2019s not very observant and doesn\u2019t care that much about inconveniencing people he finds annoying, when push comes to shove Sakusa is actually fairly considerate and even... thoughtful.\nHe complains about Komori bothering him and sending him dumb texts, but made time to take him all over Osaka when he visited. He gets grouchy when Bokuto and Hinata watch him stretch his freakish wrists, but he\u2019ll stay for hours after practice to help Hinata with his cut shot. Sakusa will insult Atsumu eight ways from Sunday but\u2026 well, there are too many things he\u2019s quietly done for Atsumu, while domming or otherwise, to even list.\u00a0\nThe rest of the drive passes in comfortable silence. The drizzle, just on the edge of snow, collects on the windows before running down in streams. Atsumu rests his chin on his palm and watches streetlights diffusing through water.\u00a0\nHe knows he\u2019ll have to deal with things one way or another, at some point\u2014that this isn\u2019t sustainable\u2014but for now he just lets himself relax into the familiar scents and calm companionship inside the protective walls of the car.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAtsumu is in his bathroom around three hours before game-start, a handful of products scattered across the counter. After the absolutely brilliant move of going into practice with a neck full of bruises, Atsumu realized he needed a real bruise covering strategy. He was only a couple of months late, he supposed. He had the weird color-correcting palette that Sakusa gave him ages ago, but never bothered to pick up the powder to go over it. After trying some drugstore powder and immediately sweating it off the day after the altercation in the stairwell, Atsumu eventually sought out a make-up specific store. It wasn\u2019t difficult to find one in the shopping mall by the practice facility.\u00a0\nHe entered with some amount of confidence which was immediately shattered upon taking in the vast and overwhelming boutique. After wandering the first aisle looking like a fish out of water, an employee found him and took pity.\n\u201cHello, sir. Can I help you find something?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 I need the stuff that\u2019s supposed to go over color correction makeup. To, uh, cover\u2026 some, um, marks on my skin,\u201d Atsumu said, face flaming. \u201cSomething that won\u2019t come off easily. I, um, sweat a lot at my job.\u201d\nThe employee, a young woman with bangs and the sharpest eyeliner wings that Atsumu had ever seen, looked very quickly down at Atsumu\u2019s neck. Her eyes darted away immediately after and she smiled pleasantly.\u00a0\n\u201cRight this way,\u201d she said, leading him down the aisles, matching a foundation powder to his skin and eventually pressing a small spray can into his hands. \u201cThis is  setting spray.  You put this over your makeup and it\u2019s not going anywhere. I mean it\u2019s not going  anywhere. \u201d\nThank the heavens above for professional, smart, and helpful sales associates.\nStill, now that the choking bruises are completely faded, Atsumu hesitates with the setting powder in his hand. He knows he needs to cover up the hickey before being on TV. He  knows that. The bruise Sakusa left after they last played is no small thing. Still, he twirls the setting spray in his fingers.\u00a0\nHe reaches up with the back of his palm and rubs at his perfect makeup job. He doesn\u2019t rub it all out, but removes just enough makeup that a shadow of the bruise can be seen. Before it can really sink in how ridiculous he\u2019s being, Atsumu applies the setting spray and heads out of the bathroom.\nHe pulls his shoes on and grabs his phone. There\u2019s one message.\nFrom:  Omi-Omi\n&gt;&gt; I saw something in my dom group that I want to try\n&gt;&gt; *link attached*\n&gt;&gt; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on any of the lists because it\u2019s kind of specific, so let me know if it doesn\u2019t look interesting to you. Regardless, do you want to meet up this Sunday?\nAtsumu clicks the link, brow furrowing as he reads. Based on it not being on the lists, he expected something crazy or hardcore, but it\u2019s just a little\u2026 weird. He shrugs. If Sakusa\u2019s into it, he\u2019ll try anything once as long as it\u2019s fairly benign.\u00a0\nTo:  Omi-Omi\n&gt;&gt; Weird. Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I\u2019m free. We can talk specifics after the game.\u00a0\nFrom:  Omi-Omi\n&gt;&gt; Don\u2019t kinkshame.\nAtsumu can\u2019t help but snort at Sakusa\u2019s dry joke. He hefts his bag onto his shoulder and glances at himself in the small mirror hanging on the wall in the genkan. He fixes his hair and ignores the purposefully exposed mark on his neck as he heads out the door.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs Atsumu drives into the garage under Sakusa\u2019s apartment complex that Sunday, he wonders what it says about him that he can already feel his dick starting to stir. Even pulling into the guest parking area is like a Pavlovian trigger at this point.\nHe just\u2026 he can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s  excited. Not just for the scene, but for everything else that comes with it: the careful attention Sakusa pays him during the aftercare, the smile that plays at his lips once everything\u2019s cleaned up and they\u2019re both settled on the couch, the ease of their interactions when it\u2019s just the two of them.\u00a0\nDuring a scene, It\u2019s always been easy for Atsumu to forget that anything else exists beyond Sakusa\u2014to feel totally and thoroughly owned, like Atsumu is  Omi\u2019s, plain and simple. But the moments before and after are starting to feel sacred as well; when the two of them are holed up together, hiding away from the outside world, it\u2019s dangerously easy for Atsumu to pretend that Omi is his, too.\nAtsumu blinks, staring at the concrete wall of the garage as his car idles.\nFuck. He\u2019s got it so bad, he thinks as he yanks his key out of the ignition . \nHis heart races on the elevator ride up to Sakusa\u2019s apartment. The self-doubt and insecurity that have been plaguing him since their last scene are melting away by the second, replaced by an intractable giddiness that\u2019s making his toes curl in his shoes. Atsumu did some extra research the other night after Sakusa sent him the link on prostate milking. The first article implied it was easiest if the person receiving stimulation was soft, which had Atsumu a bit worried. Luckily, most posts he read seemed to agree that it  can work even if the sub is hard, which\u2014thank god, because he\u2019s more than halfway there already just thinking about it.\u00a0\nAtsumu bounces in place and bites his lip when the elevator reaches Sakusa\u2019s floor. He takes a deep breath in and out, then lets himself in after a cursory knock on Sakusa\u2019s door, locking it behind him. After taking off his coat and shoes, he finds the other man sitting at the kitchen table, squinting at something on his laptop.\nSakusa looks up and gives him a once-over, making Atsumu blush.\u00a0\n\u201cHey.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cH-hey.\u201d  Smooth. \u201cM\u2019just gonna\u2014um, I should\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDo you want a cup of tea first?\u201d Sakusa asks. \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, but you seem a bit frazzled.\u201d\nAtsumu runs a hand through his hair, conscious of the half-chub he\u2019s sporting and praying his jeans are hiding it. He probably does need to slow it down a little, especially considering what they\u2019re about to do.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m never anything but completely put together,\u201d Atsumu replies, and then nearly trips over a rug. Sakusa chuckles lowly, and Atsumu lets the joke go, chest warm with his goal achieved. \u201cSure. Thanks, Omi-kun.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Sakusa stands up and stretches, his thin cashmere sweater riding up and exposing a sliver of skin at his waist. Atsumu\u2019s mouth goes dry. \u201cMotoya always says there are very few things a hot cup of tea can\u2019t fix.\u201d\nAs Atsumu slinks over to the table and Sakusa busies himself preparing the tea, a small wave of melancholy laps at his feet as Atsumu wonders if he\u2019s found one of those things.\n\u201cWhich\u2026 is objectively ridiculous,\u201d Sakusa adds, and Atsumu thinks  there it is. \nAtsumu snorts, \u201cAnd here I was thinking you finally developed an optimistic streak.\u201d\nSakusa shoots him a disapproving glare over his shoulder.\u00a0\nThe momentary feeling of sadness disappears as quickly as it came, driven off by fond amusement and the anticipation of the scene. For now, Atsumu lets himself enjoy the quiet calm of sitting at Sakusa\u2019s kitchen table, staring at his broad back as the other man makes him a cup of tea.\n\u00a0\nAfter his shower, Atsumu walks into the bedroom to find Sakusa laying a drop cloth over what looks like some kind of plastic sheet. The faint crinkle of plastic reminds Atsumu of the way Sakusa set things up the time they played with temperature; it made sense then, because between all the water, ice, and the hot wax, things got really messy.\nExactly how messy are things going to get today? Atsumu shivers and grips the hem of the towel wrapped around his waist.\n\u201cReady?\u201d Sakusa asks, turning to look at him.\nAtsumu nods, throat bobbing.\n\u201cGood.\u201d\nSakusa grabs the collar from the bedside table and beckons Atsumu over to him, one corner of his mouth tugging up in a devastating smirk. As Atsumu closes his eyes and feels the soft, padded leather wrap around his throat, he doesn\u2019t know how to describe the feeling that washes over him as anything other than calm excitement. It sounds like a contradiction, but\u2026\n\u201cOpen your eyes, Atsumu.\u201d\n...but Atsumu knows Sakusa will take care of him.\nHe lets his eyes flutter open, hyperconscious of the weight of the leather encircling his neck. Sakusa\u2019s hands linger on Atsumu\u2019s shoulders after buckling the collar in place; his gaze is heavy, nearly suffocating as his eyes slide down the length of Atsumu\u2019s body and settle between his legs. His hands follow, wrapping around Atsumu\u2019s wrists and loosening his grip on the towel bit by bit.\n\u201cMm.\u201d The towel falls to the floor and Atsumu\u2019s cheeks flame as his dick bobs free. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re going to be able to do this for me, Atsumu? It won\u2019t be easy when you\u2019re this hard.\u201d\nAtsumu swallows, the gentle humiliation making his cock twitch as they both watch.\u00a0\n\u201cI c\u2019n do it, Omi.\u201d\nGod, he hopes he can.\nSakusa\u2019s smirk grows into a small smile, \u201cGood. Get on the bed and face the headboard.\u201d\nHe reaches around and gives Atsumu\u2019s ass a little pat for emphasis, making Atsumu duck his head and scramble onto the bed, sitting on his heels and trying to hide the way his blush is spreading down to his chest. The fur-lined handcuffs are already attached to the headboard by a pair of long chains, sending a thrill all the way down to Atsumu\u2019s fingertips as he clutches at his own thighs in anticipation. He feels the bed dip, feels Sakusa slide up behind him, his clean, crisp clothes pressing against Atsumu\u2019s bare skin.\nAtsumu sucks in a shaky breath when Sakusa reaches in front of him to take hold of his wrists, wrapping him up in a perverse imitation of a hug. His chest is warm through the expensive fabric of his button-down; Atsumu finds himself tilting his head to the side, baring his throat like it\u2019s instinct.\n\u201cOh, look at you,\u201d Sakusa murmurs, lips brushing the shell of Atsumu\u2019s ear.\nRight before Atsumu went under for the very first time, he remembers having a moment of startling clarity. He wondered how on earth he\u2019d gotten to that specific point, letting Sakusa Kiyoomi tie him up so tightly he couldn\u2019t move an inch, then hit him with a riding crop and fingerfuck him until he cried.\nNow, the way Atsumu just angled his neck without thinking about it, hoping\u2014 praying\u2014 that Sakusa will kiss him there, give him more bruises, do whatever he wants with Atsumu\u2019s body\u2026 well, Atsumu can\u2019t think of anything more submissive than that.\nOh, god. What has Sakusa done to him?\nHis self-awareness ebbs away when Sakusa starts to kiss down the line of his jaw, each press of lips hot and calculated, trailing down the soft skin of his throat as Atsumu moans and arches his back. A deep ache blooms when Sakusa sets his teeth into the very spot he marked up the last time they played; Atsumu squeezes his eyes shut and chokes back a whimper, breathing hard as Sakusa worries the little patch of skin until it\u2019s throbbing.\nHe feels Sakusa guide one wrist into the restraints, then the other, anchoring his arms a comfortable distance in front of him. Atsumu isn\u2019t totally restricted\u2014he subtly moves each arm side to side, confirming that the cuffs only keep him from pulling his hands back to touch himself or interfere with whatever Sakusa chooses to do.\nSakusa\u2019s tongue flicks out to press against the sore skin he\u2019s been sucking.\n\n \u201cFuck\u2026\u201d \n\nSakusa unlatches from his throat with a slick sound that goes straight to Atsumu\u2019s dick.\u00a0\n\u201cColor?\u201d\n\u201cGreen,\u201d Atsumu breathes, widening his stance where he\u2019s perched on his knees.\u00a0\nSakusa lays one more kiss over that bruised spot before he pulls away, cold air hitting Atsumu\u2019s back. \u201cMmn. Get on all fours, then. You might have to scoot up a little.\u201d\nAtsumu exhales slowly and does as he\u2019s told, maneuvering onto his elbows and knees and shifting until he\u2019s comfortable and there isn\u2019t any strain on his muscles. His cock hangs between his legs, embarrassingly stiff, proof of how desperate he is for this.\u00a0\n\u201cGood, just like that,\u201d Sakusa purrs. Atsumu hears the  snap of a glove, the familiar pump of the lube bottle. \u201cI know you\u2019re a little worked up, but you\u2019ll need to stay away from the edge for this. If you feel like you\u2019re getting too close, just tell me, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Atsumu chokes out.\nHe shifts a little and hears the crinkle of plastic underneath the dropcloth.\nThe first touch of warm, slick fingers at his hole makes Atsumu jump. Sakusa makes a quiet noise and strokes his bare hand over Atsumu\u2019s hip, drawing slow, lazy circles at his entrance with the gloved one. Atsumu groans and drops his head, letting it hang in between his shoulders as Sakusa applies just the tiniest bit of pressure, not enough to push inside but enough for Atsumu to crave it.\nAtsumu has no fucking clue how he\u2019s going to stay away from the edge. Every other time he\u2019s been in this position, either with a partner or by himself, the end goal has always been to come. How is he just supposed to ignore years of experience?\nThen Sakusa slips two long fingers inside him and Atsumu forgets to be worried.\n\n \u201cHmnngh\u2026\u201d \n\nSakusa makes a quiet nose and curls his fingers, pulling them out slightly so that they\u2019re comfortably nestled against Atsumu\u2019s prostate. Atsumu whines at the feeling, cock dripping. It\u2019s sooner than he\u2019d normally be touched there, and more direct. It does strange things to Atsumu\u2019s belly, the way it feels almost  clinical , the way Sakusa has isolated his touch to his sweet spot.\u00a0\n\u201cThere you go, Atsumu.\u201d Sakusa begins to circle his fingertips gently, pulling another whine from Atsumu\u2019s chest. \u201cDon\u2019t let it build into anything. Just focus on the feeling of your whole body.\u201d\nHe moves his fingers in a little circle again, and again, varying the pressure as he moves them until he finds an obscene rhythm that seems to satisfy him. It\u2019s not something that Atsumu\u2019s ever experienced before.\u00a0\n\u201cUgghhh,\u201d Atsumu groans, rolling his hips unconsciously.\n\u201cShh, stay still,\u201d Sakusa whispers, tightening his grip on Atsumu\u2019s flank. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re breathing\u2026 and, I know it\u2019s difficult, but try to relax, hm?\u201d\nAtsumu attempts to at least push the tension upward, away from where Sakusa\u2019s touching him; he makes a conscious effort to relax his pelvis at the same time as he flexes his fingers, curling his hands into fists and tugging on the cuffs. Sakusa has shifted to half-circles, focusing on one side of his prostate and then the other, back and forth, back and forth, the sensation deep and visceral.\nInescapable.\nAtsumu bites his lip and fails to hold back a whimper, his dick drooling precome onto the dropcloth. \u201cFuck\u2014oh,  fuck\u2026\u201d \nHis own breathing is loud in his ears, panting in the echo chamber of Sakusa\u2019s room, even louder than the squelch of Sakusa\u2019s fingers inside him. Sakusa rubs his thumb over his hip and Atsumu scrabbles to grip onto the flimsy cloth covering the bed, desperate for something to hold onto.\nThe focused stimulation is quickly doing what it normally does: pushing Atsumu toward orgasm. He cracks one eye open and peers underneath his body, watching his cock sway and jump as Sakusa massages his prostate. His fingers aren\u2019t even that deep but it feels like he\u2019s touching Atsumu\u2019s very core, probing and pushing as he works Atsumu higher and higher.\n\u201cOmiii,\u201d Atsumu whines, eyes fluttering closed again as he tries to keep his pelvis relaxed. \u201cUgh, it\u2019s\u2014oh god\u2014\u201d\nHe feels himself clench involuntarily at the measured patterns Sakusa is drawing with his fingers. It\u2019s as if Atsumu\u2019s body is slowly slipping out of his control, muscles jumping at random as Sakusa pets firmly over the little gland. He\u2019s never had prostate stimulation this  focused before; it\u2019s getting hard to tell if he needs to pee or if he just really, really needs to come.\n\u201cDon\u2019t clench up,\u201d Sakusa reminds him, voice low.\nAtsumu groans, rocking forward to try to get away from the relentless pressure inside him. If he relaxes, he\u2019s worried he\u2019ll\u2014he\u2019ll\u2014\n\n Smack! \n\nAtsumu jolts at the sudden hit, a panicked noise escaping him as Sakusa curls his fingers then spanks him again.\n\u201cWhat did I say about staying still\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStop-stop- stop , gonna come,\u201d Atsumu gasps, back bending and squeezing his eyes shut tight. His hands try to flash back, to grab the base of his dick to hold back or touch himself, he\u2019s not sure. They don\u2019t go far though, chains catching and sending Atsumu awkwardly chest first into the bed. He feels Sakusa\u2019s fingers go still and concentrates with all his might on holding back. \u201cS-sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Sakusa murmurs. His hand returns to Atsumu\u2019s hip, soothing; something loosens in Atsumu\u2019s chest. \u201cThank you for telling me. You did what I asked you to, so don\u2019t apologize.\u201d\nAtsumu grins stupidly against the dropcloth, still trembling. Sakusa\u2019s fingers feel heavy inside him, sitting right up against where he\u2019s most sensitive.\n\u201cPlus, that was partially my fault. No matter how many times I see it, it always surprises me just how much of a masochist you are.\u201d\nIt\u2019s followed by a quick pinch to Atsumu\u2019s inner thigh that sends him gasping.\u00a0\n Shit. Atsumu\u2019s dick twitches and he squeezes around Sakusa\u2019s fingers as his blush returns full-force. Sakusa\u2019s quiet chuckle seems to invade all his senses. It\u2019s embarrassing how fuzzy his head gets whenever Sakusa talks to him like this, when he treats him like this.\u00a0\n\u201cYou have to try to stay still, though,\u201d Sakusa continues, petting the small of Atsumu\u2019s back soothingly as he starts to rub careful fingertips over Atsumu\u2019s prostate once more. \u201cThe more you move around, the more mixed signals you\u2019re sending your body.\u201d\nAtsumu sighs, trying to gather whatever small scraps of his resolve haven\u2019t already crumbled. He can do this. He can be good. He surrenders completely to Sakusa\u2019s relentless fingers as he lets his body go limp, a groan leaking out of his throat.\n\n \u201cOmi\u2026\u201d \n\nThe pressure is all encompassing, but softer when Atsumu stops fighting it. Without his muscles tensed, Atsumu finally stops feeling like he\u2019s swimming against the tide of his own pleasure. It feels somewhere between embarrassingly detached and uncomplicatedly good for a while. He feels himself getting more and more hazy.\u00a0\nAfter a few more moments, Atsumu feels his abs start to twitch, then his thighs. It\u2019s involuntary this time, and unrelated to the usual feeling of his lower half tightening in preparation to go over, or to resist it. These are just spasms, almost like the ones he occasionally feels right before he falls asleep, completely unconscious. Atsumu curls his fingers tighter in the drop cloth as Sakusa shifts a little closer, plastic crinkling under his knees.\u00a0\nThe sounds Atsumu is making are truly shameful but it doesn\u2019t  matter \u2014the only thing that matters is not coming. He can\u2019t let the feeling swell, can\u2019t let it take root. Atsumu\u2019s doing it, but he\u2019s starting to feel strange and almost unfamiliar sensations blossoming between his hips. Sakusa keeps going, too, one steadying hand on his tailbone as he insistently palpates Atsumu\u2019s sweet spot.\u00a0\n\u201cPl-please\u2026\u201d\nSakusa makes an amused noise. \u201cPlease what?\u201d\nAtsumu doesn\u2019t know. Pressure is building right behind the base of his dick, a familiar heaviness that\u2019s always brought intense pleasure once Atsumu\u2019s been good enough. He\u2019s babbling now, begging just for the sake of it because something in him is that desperate. He just needs to be good.\nThe pressure has become overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t feel exactly like an orgasm, or an edge, but even though it\u2019s unfamiliar, Atsumu suddenly realizes he\u2019s not going to be able to hold it back. He lets out a sound like a sob at the realization, his body slipping away from him.\u00a0\n\u201cUgghh\u2014 fuck\u2014\u201d \nDon\u2019t come. Don\u2019t come. Don\u2019t come don\u2019t come don\u2019t come\u2014\n\n Drip, drip, drip. \n\nAtsumu knows he\u2019s not coming. He feels close, he feels  really close, but they\u2019ve played with edging so often that he\u2019s gotten used to that feeling, learned to separate it completely from the sensation of actually going over. There was no flash of pleasure, no moment where he felt like he snapped under the mounting pressure.\u00a0\nSo why does he feel like he\u2019s\u2026\u00a0\n\u201cOh, there you go,\u201d Sakusa purrs. \u201cLook at that. What a good boy, getting it on your first try.\u201d\nDistantly, like his ears are stuffed with cotton, Atsumu hears the sound of more liquid hitting the dropcloth. He\u2019s trembling, paralyzed by the foreign sensation of ejaculating without any of the pleasure or intensity that normally comes with it.\u00a0\nIt almost feels like he\u2019s  peeing. The thought is like a bucket of cold water over his head and he peeks hurriedly between his legs, skin crawling as he imagines the disgust Sakusa would feel if he couldn\u2019t control himself like that\u2014what good is Atsumu if he can\u2019t control himself\u2014\nLooking down the length of his body upside-down, Atsumu sees that it\u2019s definitely  come dripping from the slit of his cock, not anything else. It should be a relief, but as he watches the slow, steady flow dribble onto the cloth below, Atsumu irrationally starts to panic. He realizes he\u2019s watching his release slip away.\nSakusa\u2019s fingers press a little more firmly and Atsumu whimpers again. \u201cHow does it feel, Atsumu?\u201d\nAtsumu can\u2019t speak. His body is still waiting for the feeling between his legs to crest, suspended in devastating frustration as his lips shape around words that won\u2019t come.\n \u201cHaah\u2026 \u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Sakusa sounds smug.\u00a0\nIt makes a wave of heat roll down Atsumu\u2019s body, stopping abruptly at the base of his dick as the sluggish drip of come continues. He\u2019s let Sakusa force his body to do so many things, but he\u2019s never felt so completely controlled by another as he does now.\u00a0\nAtsumu has no idea how long Sakusa keeps him like that, draining him with every cruel circle of his fingers. He can\u2019t stop groaning, shivering as a feeling he can\u2019t name consumes him; his eyes roll back at some point, then flutter closed. He can\u2019t look at himself anymore.\u00a0\n\n Drip, drip, drip. \n\nFinally, \u201cYou gave me so much. Were you backed up? Poor thing.\u201d Atsumu lets out an inhuman noise, which makes sense since he feels like\u2014 \u201cI think you\u2019re all done.\u201d\nSakusa draws a few more agonizing strokes of Atsumu\u2019s prostate, as if he wants to be sure.\n Done? Atsumu starts to panic all over again at the word, feeling empty in more ways than one. The scene can\u2019t be over so soon. It feels like they\u2019ve barely started\u2014does Sakusa not want to\u2014\nAtsumu groans in relief when Sakusa squeezes a third finger inside and starts to stretch him, finally laying off his most sensitive spot. Sakusa\u2019s not  done done with him, just with the\u2026 milking.\u00a0\nA strange feeling has settled in Atsumu\u2019s bones. No longer is he consumed by the desperate arousal he\u2019s gotten used to during scenes; instead, every sensation is muted, like he\u2019s gone numb. Atsumu squirms, wondering if Sakusa will admonish him for moving, but Sakusa just tightens his grip on Atsumu\u2019s hip and fucks him harder with his fingers.\u00a0\n\u201cOmi\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your color?\u201d\u00a0\nAtsumu freezes for a moment. What  is  his color? He feels like a stranger in his own skin. He feels off balance  . But\u2026 he can still be good. He can still make Sakusa feel good.\nAnd  god, does he want to make Sakusa feel good.\nHe swallows hard, \u201cGreen.\u201d\nSakusa makes a low noise and pulls his fingers out; Atsumu squirms and gasps in response, heart fluttering as he wonders what Sakusa sees in him right now.\n\u201cShhh\u2026 I\u2019m here, Atsumu. You\u2019re doing so well for me,\u201d he hears Sakusa murmur.\nThe praise is like a balm for his frayed nerves, keeping Atsumu calm even in the absence of Sakusa\u2019s touch. Sure enough, seconds later he hears the sound of a foil wrapper being ripped open. He feels\u2026  relieved. \u00a0\nAtsumu shifts, automatically moving to wipe the drool from his face before he remembers that his arms are restrained. He whines and pulls at the cuffs, shoulders aching as Sakusa smears more lube over his hole before pulling the glove off with a snap.\nHe needs this.  He needs this. \u00a0\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Atsumu chokes out, deepening the arch of his back as Sakusa starts to press inside.\nHe clenches involuntarily and hears Sakusa hiss. The overwhelming sensitivity that usually accompanies Sakusa\u2019s first thrust is absent, doused by the strange numbness left between Atsumu\u2019s thighs after the milking. Atsumu groans and rocks back, desperate to feel that spark, that  twist  deep in his gut  , but all he gets is a sharp spank that makes him jump and clench again as Sakusa bottoms out with a quiet groan.\u00a0\nThen Sakusa stretches out over him, pressing his clothed chest to Atsumu\u2019s back, and threads one hand firmly through Atsumu\u2019s hair before giving it a sharp  tug . Atsumu gasps and grabs fistfuls of the sheets as his throat is bared once more. Sakusa rolls his hips, grinding his cock impossibly deeper even though he\u2019s already buried to the hilt.\u00a0\n\u201cHa- aah\u2014\u201d \n\u201c Fuck , you feel good,\u201d Sakusa whispers.\u00a0\nAtsumu shivers happily, preening as Sakusa\u2019s lips ghost over the sore, bruised spot on his neck. He feels in danger of floating away. Sakusa\u2019s weight on top of him is the only thing keeping him anchored to the bed.\u00a0\nAs Sakusa kisses just above his collar and rolls his hips again, Atsumu realizes it doesn\u2019t matter that his body has been so thoroughly worked over that he\u2019s gone soft between his legs even with Sakusa\u2019s cock stroking against his oversensitive prostate with every thrust. Sakusa\u2019s groans in Atsumu\u2019s ear are drowning everything else out. Maybe his body doesn\u2019t need to climax. It\u2019s doing exactly what it should, giving Sakusa pleasure.\n This is what he wants. This is what matters.\u00a0\nAtsumu drools onto the dropcloth as he\u2019s rocked forward again and again, trying to keep his back in its deep arch, and  glows.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nKiyoomi shudders as he mouths at Atsumu\u2019s neck. Between the unique, obscene control that prostate milking gives him and the way that Atsumu\u2019s body is twitching around him, this could be over in less than a minute if he\u2019s not careful.\u00a0\nAtsumu is just so\u2026  good. Kiyoomi\u2019s stomach feels warm thinking about it.\nHe grunts and lets go of Atsumu\u2019s hair in favor of shoving three fingers between Atsumu\u2019s slack lips. Atsumu moans and sucks on them immediately, like it\u2019s fucking involuntary. Kiyoomi is covering him with his body, filling him from both ends,  scaring  himself with how completely he wants to possess the man underneath him.\n \u201cO-mi-i-i,\u201d  Atsumu mumbles around his fingers, mindless  \u2014 his thick tongue weaves loosely around Kiyoomi\u2019s digits.\n\u201cWhat is it, Atsumu?\u201d Kiyoomi breathes.\nHe doesn\u2019t answer right away, just moans brokenly with his mouth full as Kiyoomi\u2019s hips slap against his ass. He\u2019s hot and pliant inside, squeezing around Kiyoomi\u2019s cock and clinging to him every time he bottoms out like he doesn\u2019t want him to leave.\u00a0\nKiyoomi doesn\u2019t want to leave, either. Atsumu lets his fingers fall from his mouth. Kiyoomi rubs them over his lips.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWanna\u2026 come\u2026\u201d Atsumu gasps.\n\u201cOh?\u201d Kiyoomi pulls away from his mouth and reaches underneath him to feel for his dick.\u00a0\nHis belly swoops when he realizes Atsumu is completely soft. It\u2019s an entirely new level of orgasm control\u2014not just telling Atsumu he can\u2019t come, but physically making it so he can\u2019t. Atsumu isn\u2019t begging for permission, he\u2019s begging for something his body isn\u2019t able to give him right now. Fuck.\n\n Fuck. \n\n\u201cOh,  Atsumu,\u201d Kiyoomi whispers.\nHe cups Atsumu\u2019s soft cock in his hand and kisses the nape of his sub\u2019s neck, holding him as Kiyoomi drives into him faster, relishing every quiet groan that falls from Atsumu\u2019s lips. After a few more hard thrusts, Atsumu gasps and turns his face toward Kiyoomi\u2019s, eyes halfway closed and lips parted; Kiyoomi growls and shifts over to kiss him, hungry for it. It\u2019s a sloppy press of tongues and lips more than anything else, and Kiyoomi eats up Atsumu\u2019s little whimpers like he can\u2019t get enough.\u00a0\nKiyoomi rolls Atsumu in his palm, teasing him with his fingers even though it won\u2019t have any long-term effect. The chains make a faint metallic noise as Atsumu pulls on them, shoulder blades straining against Kiyoomi\u2019s chest.\u00a0\n\u201cKeep your hips up,\u201d Kiyoomi breathes into his mouth, his own jumping faster and faster as he nears the edge. Atsumu groans and shoves back against him, shaking. \u201cGood boy.\u201d\nAtsumu wails against his lips. Kiyoomi lets go of Atsumu\u2019s cock and braces both elbows on the bed, wanting as much leverage as possible.\n\u201cOmi\u2014Omi,  fuck\u2014\u201d \n\u201cGonna make me come,\u201d Kiyoomi gasps.\u00a0\nThe headboard is creaking.\u00a0\nAtsumu makes another desperate sound and rocks back, squeezing so tightly around him Kiyoomi can barely breathe.\u00a0\n\u201c Please\u2026 \u201d\nKiyoomi smiles wickedly and bites at his lower lip as Atsumu pants, gasping. \u201cYeah, you want it? Feel so\u2014fucking\u2014good\u2014\u201d\nHe abandons speech a moment later, panting against Atsumu\u2019s cheek as he takes his pleasure from Atsumu\u2019s eager body. One, two thrusts later Kiyoomi is tumbling over the edge, burying his face in Atsumu\u2019s neck and clinging to him as his orgasm rolls over him in harsh waves.\nKiyoomi stays like that for longer than strictly necessary, pressed flush to Atsumu\u2019s naked body as he comes down from his high listening to the shaky sounds of Atsumu\u2019s breathing. He can feel Atsumu\u2019s pulse underneath his lips. After indulging in the moment for a few more seconds, Kiyoomi sighs happily and reaches up to unclip Atsumu\u2019s cuffed wrists from the chains binding him to the headboard.\nIt\u2019s time to take care of his sub.\n\u00a0\nFirst, Atsumu is warm. He\u2019s not sure when it changes, but the heat leaches away quickly and before long Atsumu is so\u2026 cold.\u00a0\nHe can hear the sound of the tap running in the bathroom as he lies on his side, resurfacing slowly. Over his body is a familiar fleece blanket; beneath is a scratchier canvas sheet. Atsumu shifts, hearing the strange crinkle of plastic below him as he slits his eyes open.\nOn the other side of the bed is a wet spot, so much larger than Atsumu imagined. His gut swoops; he can still feel the remnants of it on his knees.\u00a0\nAtusmu shivers, temperature plummeting for reasons he can\u2019t understand. They didn\u2019t even do any pain play, but suddenly it\u2019s like there\u2019s a crater scooped out of his middle, the space left in its wake filled with cold air. His lower half feels strange as well: he\u2019s soft but feels completely unsatisfied, and the pang in his backside which would usually ring with satisfaction is hollow.\u00a0\nWhile he felt good during the scene, and was able to push down his insecurities, now, suddenly, he feels\u2026  used  , he realizes. He blinks in shock. So many times the thought of Sakusa  using  him has been an absolute fantasy, a source of guilty, delightful pleasure.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no pleasure now.\nHe feels empty and, even though he can hear Sakusa cleaning himself up in the bathroom, he feels alone.\u00a0\nHe hugs his arms tighter around himself, desperately trying and failing to fight off the black cloud rolling in above him. He\u2019d be lying if he hadn\u2019t saw it on the horizon, but he thought\u2026 he thought if they just kept going\u2026\nThe sheets crinkle again\u2014soiled, disposable\u2014and Atsumu feels nauseous.\nIt\u2019s  embarrassing .\u00a0\nAtsumu is suddenly choked with fear at the idea that Sakusa will soon re-enter the room to clean him up. It\u2019s bad enough that Sakusa saw him like this during the scene, a wretched mess without an ounce of control over his own body. The arousal was probably the only thing holding back Sakusa\u2019s disgust. Now that it\u2019s over, Atsumu doesn\u2019t want to be seen this way: a pathetic, desperate, used-up thing.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s that thought that, before he even realizes it\u2019s happening, drives Atsumu to his feet.\u00a0\nHe stumbles towards the door, all of a sudden thrown into fight-or-flight mode. He makes it down the hallway and into the spare bathroom where he left his things after his shower. Atsumu yanks on the comfortable clothes he usually wears after a scene with frantic movements. Unlike he\u2019d hoped, the feelings don\u2019t fade once his skin is covered; the fear of being seen and judged persists.\u00a0\nAnd now that he\u2019s already selected the option of flight, the idea of being captured and questioned by Sakusa is terrifying. How can he even explain this deviation in behavior? How can he explain that he doesn\u2019t want to to be touched or cleaned up by him, that the idea of sitting on the couch on display for the man that just took him apart at the seams could only mean exposing the sick, selfish core of himself\u2014the part of him that could ruin everything with just a few words\u2014to the one person he doesn\u2019t want seeing it.\nNo, he has to get out of here.\u00a0\nBy the time that Sakusa realizes Atsumu isn\u2019t in the bedroom, he\u2019s got his coat on, bag slung over his shoulder, and is jamming his feet into his boots.\n\u201cAtsumu?\u201d he hears.\u00a0\nHis throat tightens to the width of a straw. He hears footsteps in the hallway as he stands up in the genkan. His heart races so fast that Atsumu is afraid he might faint.\n\u201cAtsumu, where are\u2014\u201d\nHe closes his hand over the doorknob. He yanks it open and sees freedom. All he needs to do now is make sure that Sakusa doesn\u2019t follow him. His mind whirs, survival instincts bringing a lie to his lips.\u00a0\n\u201c\u2018Samu called, there\u2019s a little emergency. Everyone\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s urgent. Sorry!\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a small miracle his voice doesn\u2019t shake. The  sorry  slips out unbidden, just a bit discordant with the rest of the message, but then the door falls shut and Atsumu\u2019s moving down the hallway, refusing to look back.\nHe doesn\u2019t wait for the elevator, instead immediately going to the stairs. There are tears running down his face before his foot even hits the first step. A sob slips out of this throat as he realizes how colossally stupid he\u2019s being, how much he probably just fucked everything up.\nHe reaches up to scrub the heel of his hand over one eye, which is when he realizes that he\u2019s still wearing cuffs. Around his neck still sits the thick, black collar. He gasps and begins to claw at them, desperate to get them off and hidden away in his bag.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d he curses, shouldering his way into the parking garage.  \u201cFuck!\u201d \u00a0\nThe drive home is a blur. It\u2019s probably\u2014no,  definitely  not safe. Atsumu is still reeling from the scene, not drunk but close to it, vision misty from the tears he has to constantly wipe away in order to see any part of the road. He just wants to be  home, in his own bed, tucked under his covers where no one can see him.\n\u00a0\nBeing home doesn\u2019t help as much as Atsumu thought it would, past the initial relief of walking over the threshold. Now that he doesn\u2019t have a goal in mind, there\u2019s nothing to protect him from the nasty vortex of his own thoughts assaulting him from all sides as he stumbles out of clothes and into the shower, turning the water up as hot as it will go in a useless attempt to stop the shivering.\nHe needs to clean up. Thank god he left before Sakusa could do it for him\u2014he\u2019s  disgusting. \nAtsumu feels a little better after his shower, but it\u2019s short-lived, especially when he opens the bathroom door and the cooler air from the main studio rushes in to lick at his damp skin. He finishes toweling off in a hurry and pulls on a clean pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt, digging around in his drawers to find the thickest pair of socks he owns.\nJust showering took a ton of energy out of him. It\u2019s actually shocking the way he nearly trips three times between stepping out of the bathroom and his bed. His limbs just feel so heavy. Atsumu stumbles around to gather a few more things\u2014a glass of ice water, some kleenex\u2014before retreating gratefully to his bed, still sniffling and wiping tears away as he pulls the bedding up over his shoulders.\n Fuck.  He thought\u2026 he thought if he was good enough, if he did everything Sakusa wanted and took everything he had to give, that maybe Sakusa would\u2026\nBut why would Sakusa want to be with someone like him after what he\u2019s seen Atsumu do? Disgusting.  Disgusting. Atsumu\u2019s skin crawls thinking about what Sakusa\u2019s seen, how shameless Atsumu\u2019s been in front of him. He curls up tighter and pulls the covers over his head. He\u2019s not sure he wants anyone to look at him ever again.\n\u00a0\nWhen Atsumu next opens his eyes, it\u2019s dark in his apartment. He gets a few seconds of peace in that fuzzy, liminal space between asleep and awake; then, when he reaches for his phone to check the time, awareness comes crashing down on him, flooding him with horrible memories.\nIt\u2019s four in the morning. They have afternoon practice today, but Atsumu can\u2019t picture a scenario where he\u2019s able to leave his apartment and have anyone  see him, especially Sakusa. He has a few new texts but doesn\u2019t bother reading them; he just closes his eyes and prays for unconsciousness to take him again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s light outside when Atsumu wakes up next. This time he has to get out of bed to pee, but he crawls right back in bed after refilling his water glass and closing his curtains tightly. He\u2019s starving, but he doesn\u2019t want to make anything, and none of the food in his apartment sounds good right now. He fights back tears at the predicament.\nMaybe he\u2019ll order something from one of his takeout apps. He grabs his phone and finally sees the messages.\u00a0\nFrom:  Omi-Omi\n&gt;&gt; Hope everything is ok. Let me know if there\u2019s anything I can do to help.\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; Is Osamu-san okay?\n&gt;&gt; Please let me know if you got home alright.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re all time stamped a few hours apart. Atsumu really sucks. Here Sakusa is trying to be a good dom and Atsumu can\u2019t even text him back after recklessly driving home mid-freak out. The least he can do is respond.\nHe types out a simple message, numb as his fingers move over the screen. He opens another to Coach Foster and spins a similar lie. By the time he\u2019s done with that, there\u2019s another message from Sakusa.\nFrom: Omi-Omi\n&gt;&gt; Understood. Good to know. Again, let me know if there\u2019s anything you need help with.\nAtsumu\u2019s face starts leaking again. It hurts, wanting to take the words at face value and knowing they come from a place of responsibility and politeness. He forces himself to type two words and hit send.\nFrom:  Miya Atsumu\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Omi.\u00a0\nBy the time he\u2019s done, Atsumu feels sick and not even the slightest bit hungry any more. Before he can work through that and force himself to get up, Atsumu falls into a fitful sleep again.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s after noon on Monday before Atsumu is awake enough and builds the motivation to get up and throw together something vaguely edible. He doesn\u2019t even remember what he ate by the time he gets back to bed, absolutely exhausted. He strips down to his underwear and slides between the sheets.\u00a0\nHe tries to sleep, but the light coming in the side of his blinds cuts through his eyelids and he stays painfully conscious.\nAtsumu is caught in between and the thoughts that have been attacking him over and over return once more, in full force.\nPractice will begin soon. Guilt swirls in Atsumu\u2019s chest at missing it, but he can\u2019t imagine Sakusa will want to see him either, not after he finds out that Atsumu lied. There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll want to stick around and keep doing what they\u2019re doing. Atsumu\u2019s always known deep down that\u2019s kind of a baseline fact about himself. His life is pretty much defined by the times he can allow himself to forget before the reality comes crashing back down: people don\u2019t want to stay with Miya Atsumu.\nHis dad left before he even gave Atsumu a chance. What must he have seen in Atsumu to be with their Ma for years and then up and leave when the twins came along? Did he already sense something horrible and twisted in Atsumu? Did he know?\nHe wouldn\u2019t be the last. Atsumu\u2019s teammates and schoolmates hated him until he became useful to them, after all. Even in middle school Atsumu knew that. It didn\u2019t matter then. He had Osamu.\u00a0\nBut even Osamu didn\u2019t stay with him. Osamu left, too.\u00a0\nHe vaguely remembers words from a sports therapist he saw in his final year of high school, when everything was getting too much. Osamu was quitting and the mounting pressure of scouts approaching him, of making decisions about his future, made him feel like he was cracking. He knows it was helpful at the time. That she said a lot of things that helped Atsumu make peace with Osamu\u2019s decision and made him feel prepared for what was coming.\nThat seems really far away right now.\u00a0\nAtsumu flips the pillow over to the dry side, and digs his fingernails into his arms.\u00a0\nIs it really a shock that Sakusa wants to leave him, too? No, he made it clear this wasn\u2019t a long term thing. Once again, Atsumu is tolerated as long as he\u2019s useful.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Atsumu mumbles, for once, into the dark. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want me? Why don\u2019t any of you want me?\u201d\nHis brain provides far too many answers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOsamu goes to Atsumu\u2019s on Tuesday morning. It\u2019s the only day of the week he has someone else open the store, and Atsumu rarely has practice or a game until the afternoon or evening. It\u2019s become their standard weekly meet-up day.\nNot completely out of character, this week he forgot to text Atsumu the previous night to nail down specifics, so he\u2019s not exactly surprised when he doesn\u2019t receive any response after firing off a message over his coffee. The lazy bastard without a day job is probably still asleep. So, as he\u2019s wont to do, Osamu swings by Onigiri Miya to make sure everything is running okay and grabs a half dozen onigiri to-go.\u00a0\nHe uses the memorized codes to enter Atsumu\u2019s building as well as the electric door lock on his apartment.\u00a0\nOsamu takes off his shoes and hangs up his coat in the genkan, juggling the plastic Onigira Miya bag. He\u2019s only a little surprised to see the lights are still off in the studio as he comes out of the dark hallway into the main room.\n\u201cGet outta bed, you oaf,\u201d Osamu says as he heads into the kitchen. \u201cI even brought ya food. An athlete takin\u2019 advantage of the hospitality of a poor restaurant owner. Ma would\u2014\u201d\nIt\u2019s in that moment, as Osamu finally finds the lightswitch and illuminates the room, that he realizes something is wrong.\u00a0\nFirst, the kitchen is a mess. They\u2019ve both known how to clean up after themselves from a young age, but Osamu will admit to pulling the  I cooked you clean  move on more than one occasion. Osamu doesn\u2019t let anything get  dirty,  but he has a decent tolerance for clutter; Atsumu, on the other hand, has always been rather...  fastidious.\u00a0 \nA significant portion of their fights as teenagers started because Osamu left socks on the floor or magazines on Atsumu\u2019s bed, triggering a huffy tantrum from his twin. So seeing remnants of quick-made meals, dishes, and cooking utensils, not just left in the sink but on the counter as well, is weird.\u00a0\nHe looks over to the newly moving lump on Atsumu\u2019s bed, a tuft of blonde hair poking out from beneath the covers. Osamu thinks he hears something that sounds like  oh fuck it\u2019s Tuesday coming from that direction.\u00a0\n\u201cYep. It\u2019s Tuesday,\u201d Osamu says as Atsumu rises. \u201cDid\u2019ya have a party or somethin\u2019 last night?\u201d\nA horrible thought occurs to Osamu as Atsumu sits up, revealing his bare chest and an absolute monster of a fading hickey on the side of his neck.\n\u201cAw, hell, please tell me yer alone over there.\u201d\nThe last thing Osamu wants is for another head to pop up out of that bed. He closed the shop last night. He\u2019s too tired for this.\u00a0\nThe last thing he  expects , though, is for Atsumu to flinch like he\u2019s been hit and then for his face to crumple. His mouth curls, eyes filling up with tears as his brow furrows deeply.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m always alone, Samu!\u201d he shouts, whipping something fluffy and yellow across the room at him. Osamu catches it before it hits him in the face. \u201cYou\u2019d fuckin\u2019 know that, wouldn\u2019t ya?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe fuck is that supposed ta mean?\u201d Osamu spits out before he can even process what the hell is going on, the energy in the room going from zero to sixty.\u00a0\nHe looks down at his hands to see a stuffed, dog shaped tissue holder. Their ma bought a pair for them when they both got a terrible cold in their first year of high school. Osamu\u2019s had been grey, though he\u2019s not sure where it is now. Trust Atsumu to be sentimental enough to keep his.\u00a0\nOsamu is half-way through concluding that Atsumu got dumped by someone Osamu doesn\u2019t even really know about, which would be out of character, when Atsumu absently reaches up to rub at his eyes. When he touches the tears leaking out of the corners, he yanks his palm back like it\u2019s been burned and stares down at his own hand, seemingly baffled.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck? Why can\u2019t I stop\u2014\u201d\nAtsumu gets up and nearly pitches himself over his nightstand, sending his lamp clattering sideways. He curses before righting himself. He reaches down to grab a sweater off the ground and almost seems to fall over again. When he looks up, his expression seems more composed but there are even  more  tears streaming down his cheeks. Osamu feels his jaw has dropped a little.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is  wrong  with you?\u201d\nAtsumu levels a venomous glare at him as he stalks towards the bathroom, \u201cM\u2019just not feelin\u2019 well, okay!\u201d\n\u201cTsumu\u2014\u201d\nOsamu tries to intercept him but Atsumu petulantly dodges around him and slams the bathroom door. He does get a look at Atsumu\u2019s face though, leaking, red-rimmed eyes with dark bags beneath them.\u00a0\nWhat the fuck. Is he sick?\nWith the door shut in his face, Osamu returns to the kitchen to dig a thermometer out of the cabinet. He\u2019s ready as soon as Atsumu opens the bathroom door. He\u2019s not crying anymore but it looks like he could start again at any moment by the wobble at the corner of his lips. Osamu grabs his twin by the nose and shoves the thermometer under his tongue when Atsumu opens his mouth to protest.\nOnce it\u2019s placed, Atsumu seems to give in a little. They just glare at each other in silence in the bathroom doorway for the moment it takes for the thermometer to take its reading. A few more tears leak out of Atsumu\u2019s eyes and he scrubs at them angrily. Then the thermometer beeps and Osamu pulls it from Atsumu\u2019s mouth and lets his twin pass, hearing him stomp down the short hallway.\nHe vaguely hears the sound of the onigiri bag crinkling as he looks down at the temperature reading, gut sinking.\nIt reads 36.8 C. Not even a hint of a fever.\u00a0\nHe takes a grim breath as a new theory settles in his head. He has to stay calm, approach this right.\u00a0\nOsamu heads back into the main room of the studio to find Atsumu has already returned to bed. He\u2019s laying on his side with an onigiri in each hand, staring into space. The tissue-dog is stuffed under his arm. Osamu doesn\u2019t hold back the disgusted expression that rises to his face even as his concern grows. He grabs a cup of water and fills it to bring to Atsumu\u2019s bedside.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s on the way over that something in the room catches his eye. Normally, what with its blaring coloration, it would have stuck out immediately. As it is, Osamu thinks it\u2019s understandable that he\u2019d been too distracted to notice it earlier.\u00a0\nBut now Osamu\u2019s steps falter for just a second as he processes the bright yellow and green garment tossed over the side of Atsumu\u2019s laundry hamper. He doesn\u2019t even need to see the pair of characters peeking out of a fold that read  kusa  to know to whom it belongs.\u00a0\nWell, that answers one question, though Osamu isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s related to the current predicament. By Osamu\u2019s own estimates, Atsumu has been secretly seeing someone on the team since the beginning of the season, or at least close to it. Sakusa was at the very bottom of Osamu\u2019s list of suspects, but Osamu will be the first one to admit he barely knows the other man at all. Though, this presents an opportunity.\nIt only makes sense that one of Atsumu\u2019s secrets might know about his others.\u00a0\nA plan, at least for the imminent future, forms in Osamu\u2019s head. He needs more information before confronting Atsumu.\u00a0\nHe reaches the bed and sets the water down on the bedside table.\u00a0\n\u201cIf yer sick, ya better stay hydrated,\u201d Osamu says, and then grabs the corner of Atsumu\u2019s duvet. He yanks it up and over his head, onigiri and all. He ignores the immediate squawking and flailing. \u201cThat\u2019s what ya get for chuckin\u2019 things at people.\u201d\nThen, in the brief moment when Atsumu\u2019s head is covered, Osamu swipes his twin\u2019s phone from the nightstand and slips it into his pocket.\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t wait for Atsumu to even fully untangle himself before turning and heading towards the door.\u00a0\n\u201cAn employee jus\u2019 texted me. I gotta give \u2018em a call,'' Osamu lies.\nHe hears Atsumu mumble something but doesn\u2019t look back as he heads out into the hallway. He walks down the way a bit, towards the fire escape and away from most of the apartment doors. He fishes Atsumu\u2019s phone out of his pocket and holds it up to his face.\nOne perk of being an identical twin is that he\u2019s an elite hacker for exactly one phone on earth. It registers his face and unlocks.\nOsamu ignores the messages. He\u2019s not worried enough to invade that much of Atsumu\u2019s privacy\u2014separate from his general fear at what kind of brain bleach-requiring nonsense he\u2019d find there. No, Osamu simply taps over to Atsumu\u2019s contacts, scrolls until he finds the name and number he wants, and then resolutely hits send.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKiyoomi texts Atsumu a couple of times over the twelve hours following his hasty exit after their scene. In spite of the anxious concern that nips at him while he cleans up the bedroom and gets ready for bed, it\u2019s easy to rationalize the lack of replies due to the fact that Atsumu  had  said that it was kind of an emergency.\nHe\u2019d prefer a response, obviously, but he understands the lack of contact if Atsumu is helping Osamu deal with something like the basement of Onigiri Miya flooding. Kiyoomi frowns more deeply as he pulls on his sleep shirt. He certainly  hopes it\u2019s not anything like that. What if there was a fire or something?\nKiyoomi tries to stop himself coming up with solutions or ways to help with situations that may or may not exist. It would be a lot nicer if Atsumu would at least message him back to tell him what happened.\u00a0\nTo:  Miya Atsumu\n&gt;&gt; Hope everything is ok. Let me know if there\u2019s anything I can do to help.\u00a0\nTo:  Miya Atsumu\n&gt;&gt; Is Osamu-san okay?\nAfter hours of laying in bed, staring up at the ceiling, Kiyoomi gets a new spike of anxiety running through his chest. They\u2019d just played, and Atsumu certainly wasn\u2019t all the way back to a normal headspace when he left; when Kiyoomi went down to the garage to check, Atsumu\u2019s car had been gone. He gets that when circumstances are tight, he wouldn\u2019t want to leave it behind, but\u2026\nHe turns over and grabs his nightstand off the side table.\u00a0\nTo:  Miya Atsumu\n&gt;&gt; Please let me know if you got home alright.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a little past two in the morning. It\u2019s totally possible that even if the emergency was dealt with, Atsumu passed out at Osamu\u2019s, or home, or wherever the problem was. He sighs heavily and opens YouTube. He taps his thumb in the search bar and slowly, deliberately types  cake decorating.\u00a0 \nThe next morning, Monday, Kiyoomi gets up and starts getting ready for practice. He\u2019s still twitchy and feels like he has nowhere to put his anxious energy. Should he call Atsumu? He\u2019s literally never called Atsumu before, though. The only phone conversations they\u2019ve had have been when Atsumu rings him up, usually on his way over and wanting some input about grabbing take out or dinner from the konbini.\u00a0\nBefore Kiyoomi can make a decision, his phone dings. He snatches it up quicker than he\u2019d like to admit, way too much relief flooding him when he sees Atsumu\u2019s name on the screen.\u00a0\nFrom:  Miya Atsumu\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Osamu is good. Still dealing with a few things so I may not be at practice later today.\nEven without details, just knowing that Atsumu hadn\u2019t crashed into a ditch somewhere last night loosens the knots that had been tightening in Kiyoomi\u2019s stomach. He\u2019s still concerned, but Atsumu and his brother are okay so that\u2019s enough to give him the privacy he clearly wants.\u00a0\nTo: Miya Atsumu\n&gt;&gt; Understood. Good to know. Again, let me know if there\u2019s anything you need help with.\nThere\u2019s another buzz as Kiyoomi\u2019s tying his shoes.\u00a0\nFrom:  Miya Atsumu\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Omi.\u00a0\nHis fingers squeeze lightly around the device, unsure how to categorize the simultaneous relief and yet continued concern clouding his head. He takes one more steadying breath and vows to lay it to rest for the day, to give Atsumu the space he needs.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a good plan in theory, and gets Kiyoomi through Monday, but when their practice-free Tuesday rolls around, he finds himself getting antsy all over again. He works out in the morning, bundling up to go on a run through the slushy park near his apartment in Osaka. It\u2019s still snow season, but they\u2019ve had unseasonably mild weather the past week and it\u2019s opened up the paths enough that Kiyoomi can run until the cold air is burning his lungs.\u00a0\nHe showers when he gets back to his apartment. He\u2019s in a pair of shorts and still towelling off his hair when he hears his phone ringing in the bedroom.\u00a0\nKiyoomi makes a bee-line for it, honestly expecting Komori, his mother, or maybe one of the trainers who he\u2019s been trying to set up an extra physio session with this week. He thinks his left knee is tweaked a little. In spite of everything, his eyes still widen when he sees Atsumu\u2019s name on the screen.\nHe smacks the accept button with his thumb and raises it up to his ear lightning quick.\u00a0\n\u201cAtsumu, is everything okay?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a pause that feels much longer than it is, and then a voice speaks. It\u2019s familiar, but it\u2019s definitely not Atsumu.\n\u201cNaw, not \u2018Tsumu actually. Sorry.\u201d\n\u201cOsamu-san?\u201d Kiyoomi asks, immediately identifying the speaker. \u201cWhy are you calling? Is Atsumu okay?\u201d\nHe makes sure to keep his voice level in the face of his confusion.\u00a0\n\u201cI dunno. I mean, he\u2019s not in the hospital or nothin\u2019. That\u2019s kinda why I\u2019m callin\u2019,\u201d Osamu says, sounding weirdly reluctant. His ambiguous answer makes Kiyoomi\u2019s chest tighten. What is going on? \u201cGot a question for ya.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThere\u2019s another pause and Kiyoomi strains to hear any sounds through the line. His own heartbeat is loud in his ears as he tries to think.\u00a0\n\u201cA question\u2026 thought you might know the answer,\u201d Kiyoomi hears a sigh, like Osamu is bracing himself. \u201cIs my brother doin\u2019 drugs?\u201d\nWhatever Kiyoomi expected to hear, it certainly wasn\u2019t  that . His brow furrows and his fingers curl into the towel around his neck. His eyes drill into the bedspread.\n\u201cWhy would you ask me that?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yer high school hoodie\u2019s in his laundry hamper, which was the last piece of the puzzle f\u2019r who he\u2019s been sneakin\u2019 around with all season,\u201d Osamu says, blindsiding him again. Kiyoomi isn\u2019t sure how to feel about the fact that Osamu knows that he and Atsumu have been meeting up... and, notably, that he didn\u2019t know before. He\u2019s still confused, only getting more so. \u201cThought if anyone might know what he gets up to in his free time, it might be the person he\u2019s\u2026 well, y\u2019know.\u201d\nKiyoomi rubs his fingers over his forehead, pushing aside processing what it means that Osamu knows about him and Atsumu for later. He\u2019s still missing something. Kiyoomi sits down on the side of the bed.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I won\u2019t deny that Atsumu and I see each other outside of volleyball, but I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening currently,\u201d Kiyoomi says, frustrated, and then pauses, deliberating, before he decides to go on. He normally wouldn\u2019t offer information but this is Osamu. Kiyoomi\u2019s sure his intentions, when it comes to Atsumu at least, aren\u2019t bad. \u201cAtsumu was at my apartment on Sunday night. He left suddenly. He said you contacted him and that there was some kind of family emergency. I texted him after, but he implied that it was still ongoing. I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat the  fuck , Tsumu,\u201d Osamu interjects and Kiyoomi refocuses.\n\u201cDid something happen? Something has to have triggered this call. Did Atsumu lie about you calling him?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, the bastard lied, though I\u2019ve got as much idea  why as you seem ta,\u201d Osamu murmurs and Kiyoomi hears him take a deep breath. After a pause it seems he makes up his own mind about Kiyoomi\u2019s intentions as well. He continues, \u201cI showed up at his place this morning, and he\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 mess. It was almost noon and he was still sleepin\u2019 in a dark apartment\u2026 I basically said hello and he started crying. His place looked like he\u2019d done nothin\u2019 but sleep and eat for at least a day or two. I\u2019ve never seen \u2018im like that before. I checked if he had a fever, but he didn\u2019t\u2026 so, dunno what else I\u2019m \u2018sposed to think besides drugs. Cocaine? Ecstasy? I\u2019m not exactly well-versed but if that\u2019s not strung out I dunno\u2014\u201d\nIt clicks for Kiyoomi so hard that he doesn\u2019t even hear how Osamu finishes his thoughts. He still doesn\u2019t understand everything, doesn\u2019t know why Atsumu left on Sunday night, but he knows exactly what this is.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s not on drugs,\u201d Kiyoomi says, unsure if Osamu has actually finished talking, but the words come out on their own.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Osamu says. \u201cLike you\u2019ve never seen him do \u2018em?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t, but also I meant I think I know what this is and it\u2019s not a hangover or a comedown or withdrawal,\u201d Kiyoomi says, though he supposes it\u2019s close.\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t caused by drugs, though, so he\u2019s got a pretty clean slate as he prepares a series of lies.\u00a0\nHe wants to assuage Osamu\u2019s fears, but it\u2019s  definitely  not his place to tell Atsumu\u2019s  twin  what he\u2019s been getting up to this season. He\u2019ll have to tell a couple lies to calm Osamu down and then Atsumu can choose to tell the truth or not later.\n\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d Osamu presses.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of virus or something. Not every illness produces a fever and I got something similar the other week\u2014the fatigue can really make you emotional. One of the trainers had it too,\u201d Kiyoomi says, keeping the lie vague.\u00a0\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Osamu replies. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Kiyoomi says with his most unreadably neutral voice.\u00a0\nThe silence stretches out again.\n\u201cWell, I feel kinda stupid about all this now,\u201d Osamu admits. \u201cM\u2019sorry for botherin\u2019 you, Sakusa-san.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem. You were just worried about Atsumu.\u201d\n\u201cHe c\u2019n be a real idiot, but I guess I should\u2019ve given him a little more credit. He cares way too much about volleyball to mess it up for somethin\u2019 as dumb as drugs,\u201d Osamu continues to muse. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll let ya go if\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI can pick up some medicine for him and drop it off later,\u201d Kiyoomi cuts in. He needs to get over there. \u201cI can bring food and things too if you need to leave to go to the onigiri shop.\u201d\nKiyoomi prays for Osamu\u2019s busy schedule to work with him here. It\u2019d be really hard to help Atsumu with his brother hovering, making it impossible to explain what\u2019s going on.\u00a0\n\u201cAre ya sure? I didn\u2019t realize it would be like that with you two,\u201d Osamu says, then hums. Kiyoomi doesn\u2019t interrupt to ask what he means by that. There are more important things to focus on. \u201cI was supposed ta go in... an\u2019 if you\u2019re sure he\u2019s just got a weird bug\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem at all,\u201d Kiyoomi assures him.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Osamu says. \u201cD\u2019ya have his door codes? I\u2019ll send ya his guest code in case he falls asleep again. He didn\u2019t seem like he\u2019d be up long.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cNaw, thank you,\u201d Osamu says. \u201cY\u2019know, yer pretty different than I expected.\u201d\nOnce again, Kiyoomi has no idea what to say to that. He\u2019s already pulling clothes out of his dresser to get ready to go.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you know if it\u2019s not what I think it is,\u201d Kiyoomi says. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine before you know it.\u201d\nHe will, if Kiyoomi can do anything about it at all.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAtsumu wakes up to the sound of a knock on the door. He\u2019s not sure when he fell asleep but the apartment is dark except for the glow of his bedside lamp. He glances around blearily. He\u2019s got a couple message alerts flashing on his phone but what catches his eye is a piece of paper that looks like it\u2019s from the notebook he uses to write grocery lists sitting on his side table.\u00a0\nHe reaches out to grab it and immediately recognizes Osamu\u2019s scrawl.\u00a0\n\n \u2018Had to head into work. Called your not-boyfriend or whatever and he said you\u2019re sick and he\u2019d bring by some medicine. I\u2019ll check in after close.\u2019 \n\nAtsumu blinks. There\u2019s another light knock on the door. His brain feels just as sloppy and slow as it has been since he got home on Sunday night and the words aren\u2019t making sense.\u00a0\nBefore it clicks, there\u2019s the telltale beep of his electric lock opening, which doesn\u2019t make sense because the only ones who have the code are Osamu and his Ma, but she rarely visits and Osamu never knocks.\u00a0\n\u201cAtsumu?\u201d\n\n Oh.\u00a0 \n\nWell, not-boyfriend is more right than Osamu knows.\u00a0\nAtsumu\u2019s first instinct is to pull the blanket over his head and straight up hide. His second instinct, as has been typical of the past few days, is to start full on crying.\u00a0\nIn the end, he doesn\u2019t do anything at all, just lays on his side in shock with his back to the hallway as he hears footsteps approach.\u00a0\n\u201cAtsumu\u2026?\u201d Sakusa murmurs again, much closer this time.\u00a0\nHe feels a gentle hand on his shoulder and he can\u2019t resist the urge to flinch away, curling in on himself. Well, there goes pretending to be asleep. Or dead. Or whatever would save him from having to deal with this right now.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are ya here?\u201d Atsumu asks, voice quiet in the dim room.\nBy the bright outline of his curtains it\u2019s still midday, but he shut them tight yesterday morning when it felt like all he could do was sleep.\u00a0\n\u201cOsamu called,\u201d Sakusa says, thankfully refraining from touching Atsumu again. \u201cHe saw my hoodie here and thought I might know why you were acting unwell. I think you\u2019re in a bad sub-drop, Atsumu.\u201d\nAgain without fanfare, Atsumu\u2019s eyes start leaking again. He feels a bit of wetness spread between his face and the pillow. He hugs the tissue-dog he apparently fell asleep with more tightly, curling his fingers into the sweater he put on earlier.\u00a0\n\u201cNo shit.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Atsumu interrupts.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a long pause and Atsumu feels a short-lived flash of vindication at catching Sakusa off guard. Then he just feels worse, because it\u2019s not like Sakusa has done anything  wrong . It\u2019s Atsumu who fucked everything up.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m here to help. Osamu said there wasn\u2019t an emergency\u2026 though I know you must have had your reasons for leaving so suddenly,\u201d Sakusa says, clearly trying his best not to sound accusatory, even if it\u2019s not natural for him. Even now he\u2019s trying to be a good dominant. \u201cBut having no aftercare after a scene like that probably triggered\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Atsumu cuts him off, feeling like his blanket weighs 100 pounds. It\u2019s going to squeeze the truth out of him. \u201c\u2018Spose that probably didn\u2019t help. But\u2026 this was probably coming no matter what.\u201d\nThick tears slide sideways over Atsumu\u2019s otherwise impassive face. His brain has clearly made peace with what he has to do, but his body is still rebelling. Sub drop is so weird.\u00a0\n\u201cAtsumu? What are you\u2026\u201d\nAtsumu turns over onto his back and drapes an arm across his eyes. He shouldn\u2019t do this with his back turned, but he can\u2019t make himself look either. If he does, his resolve might crumble. Not that Sakusa will likely want much to do with him after this and what happened on Sunday. At least it\u2019ll be under Atsumu\u2019s own power.\nHe bites his lip, grits his teeth, and then goes limp.\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d\n\u00a0\n I can\u2019t do this anymore. The words echo, clear and unmistakable, over and over in Kiyoomi\u2019s head. His brow furrows and his mouth opens and then closes again.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nMaybe he misunderstood what Atsumu is talking about. The words themselves are simple but what they\u2019re referencing can\u2019t be\u2026\n\u201cI can\u2019t sub for you anymore,\u201d Atsumu says, his arm still across his face.\nKiyoomi swallows, leaning back on his heels a little where he\u2019s kneeling by the bedside. Unrecognizable emotions are beginning to leach into Kiyoomi\u2019s body. He\u2019s not  processing  this correctly.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he says, admittedly sounding like a child. Atsumu has a right to stop for whatever reason, Kiyoomi  knows  that, but he thinks he has a right to know why, at least. \u201cIs it something that I did?\u201d\nHis brain is whirring, trying to think back through all their recent scenes at once. Had he messed up somewhere? Atsumu seemed to be enjoying what they\u2019d been doing. Anything Kiyoomi threw at him just seemed to be another sign of their compatibility. Had he crossed any boundaries? They\u2019d been spending more time together before and after scenes, but Kiyoomi thought that had been welcome. It wasn\u2019t his  usual  relationship with subs, but they weren\u2019t just sub and dom. They were teammates, too. He hadn\u2019t thought it was that weird to\u2014\n\u201cNo. Omi, ya didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I can smell yer brain smoking, calm down,\u201d Atsumu says, voice so much more flat than usual.\u00a0\n\u201cThen\u2026 why?\u201d\nAtsumu sighs again, \u201cI just can\u2019t  only sub for ya. It hurts too much, messes with my head when\u2026 when I like ya.\u201d\u00a0\nKiyoomi rocks backwards a little.  Oh. \u00a0\nIt\u2019s... difficult to reconcile. For some reason he just didn\u2019t expect this. People develop feelings for each other after participating in intimate activities all the time. It\u2019s not strange, and yet\u2026 he never expected Atsumu to go down that path, or be worried about it in the middle of his athletic prime. Plus...\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 but you\u2019ve been seeing other people,\u201d Kiyoomi says, probably totally unhelpfully.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s the biggest thing that\u2019s catching in Kiyoomi\u2019s head, though. Just a few weeks ago Atsumu came into practice with bruises on his neck from someone else.\u00a0\n\u201cGod, Omi-kun, watch a movie once or twice,\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cI was tryin\u2019 ta get ya out of my head. I told ya, it was just the one guy. I realized I had it bad and thought if I could just\u2026 remind myself what it was like bein\u2019 with someone else... thought maybe I was just too caught up in subbing, ya\u2019know?\u201d\nKiyoomi doesn\u2019t know what to say. He feels stupid; after all, it\u2019s not like he hadn\u2019t done something similar around the time that he and Atsumu started seeing one another. After a moment of Kiyoomi\u2019s silence, Atsumu continues.\n\u201cAnyway, that was a royal fuck-up and it didn\u2019t work anyway. Just made me want ya more,\u201d Atsumu says, voice completely raw, hand balling up into a fist. With his other hand he gestures vaguely towards himself, in his bedridden state. \u201cAnd with this? It\u2019s too hard now to separate play and how I feel about ya. It just makes it so clear what I want but can\u2019t have\u2014dates, kissin\u2019 just because, holidays, bringin\u2019 ya back to Hyogo\u2026 all that romantic shit. I already missed a practice \u2018cause of this\u2026 I j-just\u2026\u201d\nHis other arm has come up now too, heels of his palms pressed into his eyes. He looks torn-up and it makes Kiyoomi\u2019s chest hurt. Seeing Atsumu like this and being told there\u2019s nothing he can do is distracting, even as he tries to fully understand his words.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sub for me and not have a romantic relationship,\u201d he makes himself say, knowing there\u2019s no room for misunderstanding right now. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s missing for you.\u201d\nAtsumu nods.\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t some type of play, or any of Kiyoomi\u2019s performances as a dom. When he sensed Atsumu was looking for more, he\u2019d been right, but just looked in all the wrong places. He\u2019s been so stupid.\u00a0\nAnd because of his lack of ability to connect the dots, here they are. The words are finally starting to sink in: Atsumu wants to stop seeing him.\nKiyoomi\u2026 doesn\u2019t like that, at  all . He chews on the idea of going back to how they were before, just seeing Atsumu at volleyball\u2014no more calm tea breaks in his dining room, no more quiet hours on his couch, Atsumu wrapped a blanket, the silence only broken to observe a game they both love. No more Atsumu letting Kiyoomi break him down to the rawest version of himself, where all he seems to know is pain, pleasure, and Kiyoomi\u2019s name.\nHis fingers curl into the fabric of his pants.\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t  want  that. He doesn\u2019t want this to end.\u00a0\nThe solution is simple, then. Kiyoomi speaks again before he bothers to think much more about it.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s date, then.\u201d\nSilence hangs as Atsumu seems to stop breathing. Then he pulls his arm away from his face, watery golden eyes finally visible. They\u2019re wide, still wet and running, but currently filled with shock.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to keep doing what we\u2019ve been doing without dating, we can do that. Date,\u201d Kiyoomi reiterates, unsure which part is confusing to Atsumu; he tries to keep his irritation down.\u00a0\nAtsumu\u2019s brow furrows now to match Kiyoomi\u2019s.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not some vending machine you put dates into until shibari falls out, Omi. I want the whole thing. The chance to wake up next to ya, the possibility of havin\u2019 a future with ya. I want a real relationship. You don\u2019t  do  those. You\u2019ve said, a bunch of times.\u201d\n\u201cI said I wasn\u2019t  looking  for that. I didn\u2019t understand why people in our position were searching for them so badly, but circumstances change all the time, things develop organically, and I know that people have different needs and desires. If this is what you need, I\u2019m okay with that,\u201d Kiyoomi presses, feeling desperate.\u00a0\nAtsumu sniffs, shaking his head back and forth. It looks like a new wave of tears are spilling over even though the last never really stopped.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014I don\u2019t\u2026 if it\u2019s not somethin\u2019 you wanted before, how can I be with ya knowing that?\u201d Atsumu says, running a hand through his hair. \u201cNo\u2026 this alone sucked enough already, \u2019s messy enough as it is. Yer right about focusin\u2019 on volleyball for now\u2026\u201d\nHuh, Kiyoomi\u2019s throat is stinging. It feels like things are sliding down a slope and he can\u2019t catch up to stop them. His heart beats faster in his chest. Atsumu looks away from him; Kiyoomi desperately wants to hold his eyes, but he doesn\u2019t have that power. Atsumu continues.\n\u201cI\u2019m flattered that the dick was good enough for you to be willin\u2019 to go on a date with me,\u201d Atsumu says with a humorless, breathless huff of laughter. His eyes slide shut and then open up again. Kiyoomi is so wrapped up in being offended at that concept that he almost misses what Atsumu says next, reaching out to open his side table drawer. \u201cOh. I should give these back to ya. I was freakin\u2019 out so much I walked out with \u2018em. I\u2019m sure they were stupid expensive\u2026\u201d\nWhen he pulls his hand from the drawer, his long fingers are curled around a familiar pair of cuffs and a collar. Sakusa had been so wrapped up in concern while cleaning up he hadn\u2019t even noticed they were missing after their last scene.\u00a0\nKiyoomi blinks; he doesn\u2019t reach out for them. Atsumu seems sobered by the sight of them as well. Any trace of laughter is gone from his face. His eyelashes are clumped together and Kiyoomi catches the sight of another heavy tear falling to the bedspread.\u00a0\nOnce again confused, Kiyoomi is irked, both at Atsumu\u2019s failure to understand him and at his own powerlessness. He hasn\u2019t felt so young in a while. Besides\u2026\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t even mine,\u201d Kiyoomi murmurs. \u201cIf you gave them back they\u2019d be useless to me.\u201d\nAtsumu\u2019s head tilts.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThese are  yours , Atsumu. They were never going to be used by another sub,\u201d Kiyoomi says, sour and sad. \u201cThe cuffs are fur. I got them when you mentioned cuffs bruising\u2026 they couldn\u2019t be sanitized anyway. The collar\u2026 I custom ordered it for you specifically. It\u2019s black and gold. I thought you knew. They\u2019re yours.\u201d\nKiyoomi mostly responds out of petulance now, trying to work himself up to accepting the fact that Atsumu is about to ask him to leave. He\u2019s surprised then, when, after everything else he\u2019s said, that\u2019s what makes Atsumu\u2019s face go blank. His wide eyes stare down at the items in his hands.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n They\u2019re yours.  Atsumu sets the cuffs down to look at the collar, at its sleek black exterior and rich golden lining. It\u2019s\u2026 it shouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal. As far as Atsumu knows, Sakusa is loaded. He could probably purchase a custom collar every day if he wanted. Still\u2026 he picked this one out for Atsumu.\nHe picked it out for Atsumu and apparently doesn\u2019t want anyone else to wear it.\u00a0\n\u201cIs it like\u2026 a BDSM subculture thing not ta share collars or somethin\u2019?\u201d Atsumu finds himself asking.\nSakusa scoffs, \u201cNo. I mean, they can be a kind of symbol for people, especially in 24 hour play but\u2014that\u2019s not the point. I just ordered  that  one for you specifically and it would be wrong to put it on anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Atsumu says.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not about the money or the fact that Sakusa got something for Atsumu specifically. He already kind of knew he did that with the cuffs, though he never thought of them as  his own . No, the collar feels different. It\u2019s knowing that Sakusa sat down, thought about Atsumu, and had something made specifically with him in mind. Especially after Atsumu teased him about his all-black aesthetic.\u00a0\nThe width, the colors, the fastenings\u2026  This will be good for Atsumu , he must have thought.\u00a0\nAtsumu\u2019s fingers curl around the leather.  Okay .\u00a0\nSakusa seems to sense the shift in him, and Atsumu feels eyes searching his tearstained face.\u00a0\n\u201cJust because I haven\u2019t previously looked for longer-term companionship, or find it necessary to lead a fulfilled life, doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t form connections, or...\u201d Sakusa says, speaking slower than usual, for once seeming to think about his words. \u201c...well, like you, Atsumu.\u201d\nThe collar is lowered to the bed as Atsumu finally looks up into Sakusa\u2019s eyes. What he sees there makes his throat feel thick. He\u2019s not tearing up or begging. It\u2019s understated, not quite glaring\u2014he\u2019s still Sakusa\u2014but his gaze is sincere in the low light.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2026 like me?\u201d\nHis mouth opens and closes and Atsumu almost laughs as he can  see him call back some kind of sarcastic comment. He looks away. That\u2019s how Atsumu knows he\u2019s serious when he goes on.\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sakusa says, so quiet. His face smooths and he looks back at Atsumu. His hand comes up, and then pauses, perhaps recalling the way Atsumu flinched earlier. He blinks, mouth seeming to freeze around his words before he goes on. \u201cAnd\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d\nAtsumu tips his head forward before he can think better of it, a silent invitation or plea. Long fingers slide though Atsumu\u2019s bangs, gently carding them off his forehead. The touch is familiar and so different at the same time. It sends shudders wracking through Atsumu\u2019s body.\n\u201cSo\u2026 please, Atsumu. Let me stay,\u201d Sakusa murmurs. \u201cLet me start by taking care of you and then\u2026 we can try this your way. Please.\u201d\nHe sounds scared, genuinely fearful that Atsumu will say no, and that alone breaks down the final resistance to which Atsumu\u2019s been clinging. He lets his eyes fall shut, presses into Sakusa\u2019s touch. A wet, shaking exhale is followed by another rush of tears. He\u2019s still fragile, but for the first time in a long time these tears don\u2019t feel pointless. They feel like the hurt beginning to drain away.\u00a0\nAtsumu inhales, trying and failing to stop his voice from cracking, \u201cOkay. Okay, Omi\u2026.  okay.\u201d \n\u201cOkay. Okay, Omi\u2026.  okay .\u201d\nWhen Atsumu looks back later, the whole memory will feel half like a dream. Sakusa is kneeling beside him, fingers in his hair, telling Atsumu he wants to stay, letting out a nearly shocked huff of relief at Atsumu\u2019s response.\u00a0\n\u201cOh. Okay. Good,\u201d Sakusa says. \u201cGood.\u201d\nThere are things that make Atsumu realize that this is reality, help him pin it to the earth. There is a pile of dirty tissues on his nightstand. His skin feels tacky with nearly two days of sleep-sweat and his face feels downright grimy. Sakusa is sporting a progressively more pinched expression as the silence stretches out and transitions from comforting to awkward.\u00a0\nNo, this is real.\nSakusa shifts uncomfortably where he\u2019s  kneeling  by Atsumu\u2019s bed. How mortifying. Atsumu pushes himself up on one arm, to at least give himself the dignity of sitting upright.\n\u201cUm\u2026 what now?\u201d he asks.\nSakusa\u2019s brow furrows, \u201cI take it\u2026 you don\u2019t want to go on a date right now\u2026\u201d\nAtsumu sputters. \u201cNo, Omi-kun, I don\u2019t wanna go out in the middle of a fuckin\u2019 drop!\u201d\nHis eyes well up as if to make his point extra clear.\u00a0\nThat seems to reorient Sakusa at least. He pushes himself up to his feet and brushes the nonexistent dust off his knees.\n\u201cRight. My suggestion would be to focus on that,\u201d he says, holding out a hand to help Atsumu up. \u201cI thought, since missing aftercare probably was a big factor in kicking off the drop, going through a version of our usual routine might help.\u201d\nAtsumu hums, a little wobbly as he gets to his feet, \u201cUh, okay\u2026 if you think it\u2019ll help. I\u2019m not keepin\u2019 ya from anything, right?\u201d\nIt makes one of those familiar lashes of shame lick up his insides. He sure is\u2026 imposing. In, like, every way. His face burns.\n\u201cAtsumu. It\u2019s our day off. I was going to read the new book on load management that Coach has been pushing, which I can just as easily do on the bus on Thursday.\u201d\nAtsumu relaxes a little. The clarity is... appreciated.\u00a0\nSakusa continues, \u201cIf you want, you could start with a shower. The hot water and the steam might be refreshing after crying.\u201d\nAtsumu rolls his eyes as he furtively gathers up his dirty tissues to throw them away. He tries not to get distracted by the other clutter.\n\u201cYou can say I\u2019m gross, Omi-Omi,\u201d Atsumu says, going for a tease and getting closer. \u201cYou being too nice is just weird.\u201d\nSakusa is picking up his duffle from the floor, rifling through the pockets to recover what Atsumu now notices is a box of jasmine tea, the kind he\u2019d developed a habit of drinking at Sakusa\u2019s.\n\u201cThat was a genuine suggestion. Your current state doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d he says and then shoots Atsumu a sly glance. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you much messier than this before.\u201d\nHe\u2019s also  said  much dirtier things than that to Atsumu, but in his current, vulnerable state, it easily sends a flush right up to his hairline.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to shower now,\u201d he says and quickly heads towards the bathroom.\u00a0\nUnsurprisingly, Sakusa is correct that the shower feels good. Atsumu isn\u2019t sure exactly how long he lets the hot water pour over his head, across his tender, cry-sore eyelids. He loses count of the number of tired but contented sighs that leave his steam-filled lungs. By the time Atsumu steps out onto the bathmat, he even feels vaguely human again\u2014still close to tears, but in less of a desolate and more of a \u2018watch your favorite movie and cry a bit\u2019 way.\u00a0\nSome of that good feeling evaporates when Atsumu heads out into the main living area, dressed in a pair of clean sweats and a new sweater, to find Sakusa wearing a pair of rubber gloves and scrubbing his way through Atsumu\u2019s dirty dishes. His kettle is heating up on the stove and all his pots and pans are aligned neatly in the drying rack. Sakusa looks up and Atsumu flushes with embarrassment.\u00a0\n\u201cMy  god , Omi-kun, ya didn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cI was gonna get to it\u2014\u201d\nSakusa tilts his head.\n\u201cI assure you it was no trouble,\u201d he says slowly and clearly. \u201cI was getting ready to make tea and realized it would only take a couple minutes to clear the counter. I hope you don\u2019t mind that I borrowed your gloves.\u201d\nHe holds up his hands, clad in the bright blue rubber gloves that Atsumu bought when he first moved into the apartment and then never really used. His hands weren\u2019t sensitive to heat, so he always did the washing bare-handed. Now, though, with the gloves that extend halfway up Sakusa\u2019s forearms and the stern expression on his face, Atsumu can\u2019t help but be reminded of Kita in his clean-up regalia. It incites a sense of comfort that is just enough to prevent Atsumu careening off into another shame spiral.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, if yer sure,\u201d Atsumu says, wandering further into the kitchen, his bare feet still half tucked into his sweats. \u201cJust\u2026 y\u2019know, I\u2019m not usually a slob like this.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m aware, Atsumu,\u201d Sakusa says, rinsing the last of the plates. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t even really slobby\u2026 I grew up around athletes, you know. In comparison\u2026\u201d\nAtsumu almost laughs at the way he shudders.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, well lemme dry then,\u201d Atsumu insists, padding around to Sakusa\u2019s other side.\nThe two of them make short work of the dishes together, side by side as Sakusa passes each one to Atsumu. They don\u2019t talk, but it\u2019s not uncomfortable. Sakusa is never one to speak frivolously, Atsumu has noticed, which contrasts sharply with his own tendency to nervously babble. Right now, though, he\u2019s so exhausted that his brain is actually quiet, meaning his mouth is too.\nFor all that Atsumu bristled uncomfortably at the concept of Sakusa cleaning up after him, it feels really nice to clear the sink and counters with minimal effort on his part. He hadn\u2019t realized how much the clutter had been weighing on him until the heaviness was lifted.\nSakusa bullies Atsumu over to the couch while the water finishes boiling, pulling the familiar fleece blanket out of the bag he\u2019d retrieved from his apartment and tucking it around Atsumu\u2019s sides. It\u2019s so endearing that Atsumu waits to rearrange himself until Sakusa turns toward the television, reaching for the remote and turning it to one of yesterday\u2019s VLeague games.\nIt\u2019s the Hornets versus the Warriors, the latter of whom the Jackals are playing on Thursday. Atsumu would have needed to watch this anyway since he very obviously missed out on it\u2014and everything else going on in the world\u2014yesterday. He snuggles deeper into the couch and sighs, glancing over his shoulder to watch Sakusa prepare the tea.\nThe smell of jasmine calms Atsumu down even more as Sakusa carries two cups over to the couch.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, Omi.\u201d\nAtsumu takes a deep breath as Sakusa settles next to him. They\u2019ve sat side by side after every scene they\u2019ve done, but today he finds himself wishing they were sitting closer. He wonders if it has something to do with the delayed aftercare. Either that, or the fact that his feelings are out in the open now. And Sakusa\u2026 probably\u2026 returns them?\nThe short distance between them is palpable.\u00a0\nFuck. This is high school shit. Only a step above pretending to yawn then wrapping your arm around the other person. Atsumu scrubs a hand over his face and takes a sip of his tea, trying to ignore the urge to scoot closer.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s barely even been awake for an hour, but it\u2019s been such an emotionally exhausting time that Atsumu\u2019s eyelids start to droop after only a few minutes. He doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s actually nodding off until he feels Sakusa take the teacup out of his hands and place it on the coffee table.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, I wasn\u2019t done!\u201d\n\u201cYou were about to spill it on your lap,\u201d Sakusa says, sounding amused. \u201cYou can take a nap, you know. I won\u2019t be offended.\u201d\nAtsumu huffs and draws his knees up onto the couch, tucking them so his feet are under the blanket. \u201cM\u2019just restin\u2019 my eyes...\u201d\nSakusa snorts. \u201cWell, you can  rest your eyes, then.\u201d\nAtsumu tries his best to pay attention to the match, but the pull of sleep is so strong that he eventually gives in, leaning back against the couch and drifting.\n\u00a0\nKiyoomi doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s fallen asleep until he jerks awake to the sound of the electric keypad beeping. He has a few moments to take stock of everything\u2014Atsumu slumped against his side, the muted TV still throwing shadows across the dimly lit room, the cramp in his neck\u2014before the door opens and the lights are flung on. Still reeling from the day\u2019s events, Kiyoomi\u2019s sleep-addled brain is having a bit of trouble processing things. Atsumu lives by himself, so unless his apartment is being broken into, it\u2019s likely\u2014\n\u201cTsumu!\u201d he hears Osamu call from down the hallway.\nKiyoomi doesn\u2019t answer just yet. If he yelled, that would disturb Atsumu, who hasn\u2019t yet woken and whose unexpected weight against his side is proving to be very comfortable. He cranes his neck awkwardly around to look at the doorway and waits.\nWhen Osamu comes into view, he\u2019s wearing a surgical mask and carrying two bags of food, both of which he nearly drops when he does a double take at the sight of Kiyoomi. It takes everything in Kiyoomi\u2019s power not to laugh.\n\u201cHello, Osamu-san,\u201d he says quietly.\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 hell, ya scared me,\u201d Osamu says, matching his volume. \u201cDidn\u2019t realize ya\u2019d still be here. Tsumu asleep?\u201d\nKiyoomi nods, trying not to move too much, and points to his side. Osamu sets the food down on the newly-cleared counter and comes to peer over the back of the couch. Kiyoomi\u2019s eyes slide over to Atsumu as well, taking in the peaceful expression on his face.\n\u201cHuh.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s feeling better,\u201d Kiyoomi murmurs.\nOsamu blows out a breath. \u201cThank god. It really freaked me out seein\u2019 him like that.\u201d\nKiyoomi\u2019s sure it did. Guilt itches underneath his skin, both from the part he unknowingly played in the subdrop and from lying, but Kiyoomi is firm in his belief that Atsumu should be the one to tell the truth\u2014only when he\u2019s ready, if ever.\n\u201cI think knowing he has people looking after him helped a lot, even if he won\u2019t admit it,\u201d Kiyoomi says, meeting Osamu\u2019s eyes again. He\u2019s not very good at saying comforting things, but this feels neutral and vague enough that it doesn\u2019t seem out of place.\nOsamu snorts and perks up. \u201cOh, he\u2019s never gonna admit it. I hope y\u2019aren\u2019t expectin\u2019 a thank-you card.\u201d\nKiyoomi closes his eyes and bites down the laugh that\u2019s threatening to bubble up from his chest. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019m gonna put this stuff in the fridge.\u201d\nOnce Osamu starts rummaging around in the bags he brought, Kiyoomi cracks his eyes open and glances down at Atsumu again. A feeling is making itself at home in his chest, at once foreign and familiar. He reaches over with the arm that Atsumu isn\u2019t currently leaning on and tugs the blanket a little more tightly over Atsumu\u2019s curled-up form.\nAs the noise from the kitchen gets a little louder, Atsumu\u2019s face twitches; so does his hand, which is clutching the blanket. His eyelids flutter, but stay closed. His breathing gets a bit faster.\nKiyoomi smirks.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, that\u2019s the last of it,\u201d Osamu says, wandering back over. \u201cHey, sorry for bargin' in on ya. I told\u2019im I was gonna come back later, but he probably forgot. He was sleepin\u2019 like the dead when I left.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem,\u201d Kiyoomi says. \u201cHe\u2019s awake now, although I don\u2019t think he wants us to know that yet.\u201d\nAtsumu\u2019s brows knit together and he turns his face into Kiyoomi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNo\u2019m not\u2026\u201d\nOsamu barks out a laugh. \u201cStop lyin\u2019, ya bum.\u201d\n\u201cGo \u2018way, Samu,\u201d Atsumu mumbles. He cracks one eye open to glare behind the couch, then sits up a little, blinking slowly. \u201cWhy\u2019re ya wearin\u2019 a mask? Ya sick or somethin\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Yer the one that\u2019s sick, I\u2019m just wearin\u2019 one so I don\u2019t take yer germs back to the shop!\u201d\nKiyoomi swallows. Oh. Right. He never got the chance to tell Atsumu that, as far as Osamu knows, he has some kind of virus.\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t make a point of lying very often\u2014he\u2019s usually brutally honest even when the situation calls for some truth-glossing\u2014so he\u2019s not used to the feeling of being caught in a lie. It\u2019s an odd and uncomfortable sensation, the hollow weight that twists in the pit of Kiyoomi\u2019s stomach when both twins look at each other in confusion then turn toward him at the same time.\u00a0\nHe tries to make meaningful eye contact with Atsumu, but doesn\u2019t hold out much hope that Atsumu will read between the lines.\n\u201cI told him about the virus that\u2019s been going around, Atsumu. The one you have that\u2019s been making you feel so bad the last several days...\u201d\nHe and Atsumu stare at each other for several seconds. Atsumu blinks.\u00a0\n\u201cActually, now that Osamu-san is here... I feel better about leaving to get that tapioca tea you wanted,\u201d Kiyoomi says slowly. He wants to give Atsumu an opportunity to talk with Osamu alone about what really happened, but only if he\u2019s ready. \u201cDo you still want one? I can go pick up one for each of us.\u201d\nBlessedly, understanding seems to dawn on Atsumu\u2019s face a few seconds later; he takes a deep breath and stretches his arms over his head, then nods as he sits up fully. \u201cYeah, if yer offerin\u2019, Omi-kun. Thanks.\u201d\n\u201cI obviously am,\u201d Kiyoomi says, getting up off the couch. \u201cTaro with brown sugar pearls, right?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a horribly sweet drink that he\u2019s unfortunately seen Atsumu order on more than one occasion. Atsumu\u2019s eyes light up and he nods again.\n\u201cHow about you, Osamu-san? Can I get you anything?\u201d\nOsamu\u2019s eyes are slitted; he\u2019s looking at Kiyoomi suspiciously. Kiyoomi looks right back at him, keeping a mild expression on his face, until Osamu eventually mutters, \u201cThe same.\u201d\nKiyoomi grabs his keys from where he\u2019d left them on the counter. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to a place close to my apartment that lets you customize the amount of added sugar. I might stop by my place to grab a few things as well. I\u2019ll probably be gone for about thirty minutes.\u201d\nAtsumu inclines his head in understanding as Osamu looks back and forth between both of them, squinting. As Kiyoomi gathers his coat and pulls on his shoes, he wonders how Atsumu\u2019s going to go about explaining this, and how much detail he\u2019s going to go into. From what he\u2019s seen of the twins interacting, they seem to be much more open than Kiyoomi and his siblings. Kiyoomi is pretty sure Kinsuke and Masumi would rather die than talk about sex with him.\nIn any case, he\u2019ll likely be able to tell how the conversation went by the look on Osamu\u2019s face when he returns.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen the door closes in Sakusa\u2019s wake, Osamu raises his eyebrows and saunters over to the couch.\n\u201cSo, it was \u2018Omi-kun\u2019 all along, huh?\u201d\n\u201cShaddup,\u201d Atsumu gripes, blushing.\n\u201cHe knows your tea order and everything,\u201d Osamu needles, making himself comfortable on the couch. \u201cI gotta say, Tsumu, I had a mental list of all the teammates you mighta been screwin\u2019 around with and Sakusa-san was at the very bottom.\u201d\nAtsumu covers his face with his hands. He\u2019d thought it would be easy to tell Osamu what\u2019s been going on, but if he\u2019s getting this easily embarrassed it\u2019s going to be more difficult than he expected. It\u2019s probably because of the emotional whiplash he\u2019s gone through today. Sakusa came to see him. Sakusa stayed with him.  Sakusa likes him. \u00a0\n\u201cAnd I know he has a thing with germs, so I\u2019m surprised he stayed to nurse ya back to health,\u201d Osamu continues. \u201cI guess if he already had whatever\u2019s goin\u2019 around, it makes more sense, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAgh,\u201d Atsumu groans into his hands, cutting him off. He takes a deep breath and looks up. \u201cSamu, m\u2019not sick.\u201d\nOsamu rips off his mask and holds it above his head like a trophy, eyes gleaming,  \u201cHa! I knew it. You both\u2019ve been actin\u2019 weird since I got here.\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Atsumu deadpans.\nHe yelps when Osamu shoves him. The mask flutters to the ground as both of them shift on the couch, some of the tension dissipating. Not all of it, though; the hard part comes next.\u00a0\n\u201cSo, if yer not sick, then what\u2019s been goin\u2019 on?\u201d Osamu asks before Atsumu can collect himself. \u201cYa scared the shit outta me this morning so bad I called Sakusa and asked if you were on drugs.\u201d\nThe day\u2019s emotional whiplash continues as guilt, shame, and outrage race through Atsumu\u2019s gut one after the other. \u201cYa did  what?\u201d \n\u201cWell, what the fuck was I supposed to think, asshole? The place was a wreck and you were all zoned out, stumblin\u2019 around and cryin\u2019 all over the place.\u201d Osamu runs a hand through his hair and Atsumu\u2019s eyes drop to the ground, his face burning. \u201cActually\u2026 wait, Tsumu\u2026\u201d\nAtsumu glances up again and is startled to find Osamu\u2019s dark eyes filled with concern.\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t\u2026 hurtin\u2019 ya, is he?\u201d\nAtsumu\u2019s eyes bulge. First drugs, now abuse? Osamu is really assuming the worst here.  \u201cNo, oh my god. No, he\u2019s not.\u201d\nThen again, Sakusa  does hurt him sometimes\u2026 but not in any way Atsumu doesn\u2019t want. He takes a deep breath and sighs heavily; this is probably the best opportunity he\u2019s going to get to bring this up semi-naturally, actually.\u00a0\n\u201cAlthough\u2026 have ya heard of S&amp;M?\u201d\n\u201cLike, the song?\u201d\n\u201cNo, the actual  thing,  ya know\u2026\u201d Atsumu swallows. Four months later and he\u2019s still embarrassed to talk about it. He doesn\u2019t know how Sakusa does it. \u201c  BDSM\u2026  Bondage, m-masochism\u2014all that kinky stuff.\u201d\n\u201cMaso\u2026\u201d Osamu trails off and then his expression turns stormy. \u201cSo he  is hurtin\u2019 ya? If he is\u2014Tsumu, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n\u201c Samu  , he hurts me  in bed  because I  ask  him to,\u201d Atsumu blurts out, not liking where the conversation\u2019s headed. Wait, shit. He knows he tends to overshare, but he never meant to say  that. He blushes to the roots of his hair when Osamu\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cWait, hear me out. This actually has to do with what happened this mornin\u2019.\u201d\nShocked silent, Osamu freezes for a few long seconds. Eventually, he settles back against the couch and runs a hand through his hair, waving the other in a  go on motion.\n\u201cSo\u2014here, I\u2019ll start from the beginnin\u2019. I was over at his place with some other teammates, right, and Shoyo-kun was in the toilet but I had to go too, so I snuck into Omi\u2019s room to use his ensuite.\u201d He pointedly ignores the look on Osamu\u2019s face. \u201cBut his bathroom was full of leather stuff that he left out to dry\u2014handcuffs, things like that. I didn\u2019t mean to ask him about it but I couldn\u2019t help myself, and he basically confirmed it was for\u2026 uh, bondage. I was curious about it, so he sent me an article on BDSM 101.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Osamu mutters, putting his head in his hands.\n\u201cStop it! Look, I know how it sounds. If ya keep interruptin\u2019 me every time I talk about a bad decision I made, we\u2019re never gonna finish this story,\u201d Atsumu snaps. Osamu laughs. \u201cSo the link he sent had more links, and  those links had more links, and I ended up goin\u2019 down this rabbit hole, right? I\u2019d never even thought about any of that stuff before, but a lot of what I read about sounded cool, and I wanted to try it.\u201d\n\u201cSo you tried it with Sakusa,\u201d Osamu says into his hands.\nAtsumu shrugs. \u201cBasically, yeah. He didn\u2019t think I was takin\u2019 it seriously at first, but once he realized I  was, he invited me over and\u2026\u201d\nHe trails off, remembering the way he felt when Sakusa cuffed him to the headboard for the very first time and made him come three times in a row. The heat in his eyes\u2026 the low purr of his voice, a tone Atsumu had never heard from him before\u2026\nOsamu raises his head to glare balefully at him. \u201cAlright, I get it. Ya got stars in yer eyes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? It was  really  good!\u201d Atsumu defends himself. Osamu\u2019s lip curls in disgust. \u201cOriginally I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d like it that much, \u2018cause\u2026 uh, d\u2019ya know what doms and subs are?\u201d\n\u201cKinda, I think,\u201d Osamu says. \u201cLike tops and bottoms, right?\u201d\nAtsumu blushes, thinking of the time Sakusa put clamps on his nipples and rode him until he cried. \u201cUh\u2026 not exactly. That part of it is kinda about\u2026 control, I guess. Doms are the ones who have the control, and subs are the ones who\u2026 give it up.\u201d\nHe and Osamu look at each other for a second. Atsumu is pretty sure his entire face is red.\u00a0\n\u201cNo way. Yer the biggest control freak I know,\u201d Osamu says. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t think I would like it!\u201d\nOsamu narrows his eyes. \u201cOkay, so now that ya put  that mental image in my head, what does that have t\u2019do with this mornin\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting there!\u201d Atsumu splutters. Whatever shade his face was before, it\u2019s darker now. \u201cSo it was good enough that we met up a second time, then\u2026 well, a bunch more times.\u201d No need to go into  too many specifics, he thinks. \u201cLike, once a week since the beginning of the season, no strings attached. So one of the other\u2026 uh, parts to all this\u2026 ya can dom and sub without any pain involved, right? S&amp;M and control are separate. But Omi and I\u2026 we, uh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh my  god.\u201d  Now Osamu\u2019s blushing too. Atsumu wants to die. \u201cSo ya really did ask him to hurt ya?\u201d\nAtsumu nods. \u201cI can\u2019t really explain why I like it. I know most people aren\u2019t wired like that. But Omi likes to dish it out, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOkay,  okay,\u201d Osamu cuts him off, waving his hands around his head as if he can physically stop Atsumu\u2019s words from reaching his ears. \u201cAgain, what does this have t\u2019do with this mornin\u2019? I\u2019m beggin\u2019 ya here, Tsumu\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sayin\u2019 there\u2019s a point t\u2019all of it,\u201d Atsumu snaps. \u201cJust shut it for a second.\u201d\nOsamu flips him off but stays silent.\u00a0\n\u201cSo there\u2019s this, like, fight-or-flight evolution thing that happens when ya get hurt,\u201d Atsumu says slowly, thinking back on all the readings he did on subspace and aftercare. \u201cYer brain releases a bunch of endorphins and adrenaline to kinda, like, numb the pain and give ya energy to escape from whatever wild animal\u2019s hurtin\u2019 ya.\u201d\n\u201cDid you just call Sakusa a wild animal?\u201d\n\u201cSamu, I  swear to god.  Anyway, so a bunch of chemicals get dumped into yer system all at once as a response to the pain, and it\u2019s a  rush.  Especially when Om\u2014uh, the dom, um, keeps doin\u2019 whatever\u2019s causin\u2019 it. I\u2019ve never done drugs, despite what  some people  might think, but it\u2019s gotta be similar.\u201d Atsumu swallows. Osamu isn\u2019t running away or calling him disgusting, so that\u2019s a good sign, at least. \u201cSo it\u2019s like a high, right? Which means there can be a crash after if y\u2019aren\u2019t careful.\u201d\nFinally, he sees Osamu\u2019s eyes light up in understanding. \u201cThat\u2019s what was happenin\u2019 earlier.\u201d\nAtsumu looks down at his lap. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cSo does it happen every time you two\u2026 do it?\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d Atsumu shakes his head. \u201cThis was actually th\u2019first time for me. The idea is that afterward yer supposed t\u2019do, like\u2026 self-care stuff, basically, with the dom. Yer not supposed to leave right after, and neither is the dom. Ya gotta do stuff that makes ya feel happy and taken care of.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, like bubble baths?\u201d Osamu teases. He\u2019s obviously joking, but...\n\u201cYeah, exactly.\u201d\nOsamu gives him a flat look. \u201cSakusa Kiyoomi. Gave you bubble baths.\u201d\n\u201cYa don\u2019t have\u2019ta make that face!\u201d\n\u201cLook, ya realize how wild that sounds, right? I still haven\u2019t ruled out that this whole day\u2019s just been one crazy dream,\u201d Osamu says. \u201cOr a prank\u2026 holy shit, Tsumu, is this a prank\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI thought I told ya to stop interruptin\u2019 me! It\u2019s not a damn prank!  Anyway, the whole point of the aftercare is to have yer body make some more happy chemicals so the comedown\u2019s, uh, gradual instead of a crash. Omi was always really good about it, even though we weren\u2019t, like, together or anything. I\u2019m the one that fucked it up two nights ago and left right after we hooked up.\u201d\n\u201cWait, isn\u2019t that what you just said yer  not  supposed t\u2019do?\u201d\nAtsumu wishes he could sink right through the couch cushions. \u201cYeah, but\u2026 I panicked, okay? I panicked \u2018cause I caught feelings and started carin\u2019 more about what he thought of me\u2014\u201d he ignores the way Osamu\u2019s eyebrows rise up practically into his hairline\u2014 \u201cand then suddenly after that last time, the thought of him seein\u2019 me like that\u2026 I felt so  gross. I thought he was never gonna like me back if he saw me like that. So\u2026 I ran.\u201d\nHe wipes the back of his arm across his eyes, which have started to tear up again. It\u2019s a good reminder that, although things are better now, the whole incident is still pretty fresh.\n\u201cTsumu\u2026\u201d There\u2019s pity in Osamu\u2019s voice, which makes Atsumu\u2019s eyes sting as more tears spill over.\u00a0\nHe scrubs his arm over his eyes once more.\n\u201cBut I crashed, obviously,\u201d Atsumu mumbles, trying to keep his voice steady. \u201cAnd stayed like that \u2018til ya found me this mornin\u2019. I\u2019m\u2026 m\u2019glad ya called Omi.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\nAtsumu feels the corner of his mouth quirk up, \u201cYeah. But probably only \u2018cause it turns out he likes me back, maybe? I\u2019d be pissed at ya otherwise.\u201d\nHe glances over just in time to watch Osamu\u2019s face split into a goofy grin. \u201cNo shit?\u201d\n\u201cAt least, that\u2019s what he said,\u201d Atsumu says, finally letting his smile widen a little as he shrugs, feeling vulnerable.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s still an underlying thread of insecurity there at what it took to make Sakusa admit any kind of feelings for him, but Atsumu knows Sakusa isn\u2019t the type to do anything out of pity. Plus, he might be a jerk, but he\u2019s not the kind of person that would  lie about something like that just to keep a hookup arrangement going. Atsumu is at least confident in that.\n \u201cTsumu.  Geez, I never thought he\u2019d be the type\u2019a guy to like anybody,\u201d Osamu says, punching him in the arm. \u201cSo\u2014what, are you guys datin\u2019 now?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t know,\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten the chance to have, like, a real talk about it yet. My head\u2019s still in a kinda weird place. Should be all better by tomorrow, I hope at least.\u201d\n\u201cWell, fingers crossed, then. Suna\u2019s gonna throw a fit, ya know. He was sure it was yer captain.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d  Atsumu screeches. \u201cI specifically said it  wasn\u2019t him!\u201d\nOsamu laughs. \u201cYeah, but he said you\u2019ve had a thing for authority figures since Kita-san.\u201d\nAtsumu goes scarlet thinking of the time\u2014and the  place\u2014  Sakusa suggested the exact same thing. Then, to make matters worse, Osamu smirks in a way Atsumu knows from experience means  \u2018I\u2019m about to torture my brother.\u2019 \n\u201cAlthough, I guess he wasn\u2019t  all  wrong, was he?\u201d\nAtsumu makes a strangled noise and moves to slap him.\u00a0\nOsamu blocks his open palm, expecting it, and they tussle for a few seconds until Atsumu finally lands a weak hit on Osamu\u2019s shoulder. Osamu\u2019s still smirking, though, so Atsumu doesn\u2019t feel particularly victorious.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, I brought all yer favorites,\u201d Osamu says, standing up from the couch and stretching. \u201cI thought you were gonna die of a virus or somethin\u2019 so I went all out.\u201d\nAtsumu follows him over to the kitchen, an odd sensation clawing at his stomach. He feels\u2026 grateful, and horribly young. Full yet hollow at the same time. There isn\u2019t any other way to describe it. It\u2019s followed by a feeling he  can name: hunger. He\u2019s barely had anything to eat all day, and his stomach growls at the sight of the fatty tuna Osamu pulls out of the fridge.\n\u00a0\nWhen Kiyoomi returns, cardboard takeout tray of three drinks in hand, the twins are gathered at Atsumu\u2019s kitchen counter, sampling several of the dishes Osamu brought.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d he calls, slipping off his shoes.\nOsamu tenses slightly. Though he\u2019s standing with his back turned, Kiyoomi can see the tips of his ears turn bright red, which gives him a solid idea that Atsumu came clean to his brother. Atsumu\u2019s cheeks color a little too as he glances at Osamu then dashes over to retrieve his tea.\n\u201cYou know I was about to bring them over,\u201d Kiyoomi drawls, amused.\u00a0\nAtsumu takes a sip of his drink and makes a happy noise. \u201cCouldn\u2019t wait! Thanks, Omi-Omi!\u201d\nHe seems to be feeling even better, then. Kiyoomi walks over to the kitchen counter with the other two drinks still wedged in the cardboard tray and pulls out the purple one.\u00a0\n\u201cHere you go, Osamu-san.\u201d\nAfter Osamu almost drops the tea when Kiyoomi hands it to him, Kiyoomi looks up at his face and finds it flushed a deep shade of scarlet. He\u2019s not sure he\u2019s ever seen that color on a human being before.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks\u2026 I, uhhh\u2014\u201d Osamu scratches his neck\u2014 \u201cM\u2019actually gonna take this to go, \u2018cause I gotta, uhm\u2026 get back to the shop for close.\u201d\n\u201cYer n\u2019t g\u2019na stay f\u2019r d\u2019ner?\u201d Atsumu mumbles around what sounds like a mouthful of little tapioca balls.\nOsamu scoffs. \u201cI already had it, ya scrub. You guys are the ones that slept through dinnertime.\u201d\nHis eyes flick to meet Kiyoomi\u2019s for less than a second before they dart away again. Osamu\u2019s gaze isn\u2019t hostile or suspicious, Kiyoomi notes, it\u2019s just\u2026 flustered. Atsumu must have been\u2026 detailed in his honesty. Osamu runs a hand through his hair and bolts around the pair of them to get his shoes.\n\u201cThank you again for the tea, Sakusa-san!\u201d he calls over his shoulder.\n\u201cIt was no trouble,\u201d Kiyoomi says, trying not to laugh. He suspects Atsumu\u2019s twin is in for a night of embarrassed googling.\nOnce Osamu has taken his leave, Kiyoomi turns to Atsumu, who\u2019s somehow already halfway done with his drink.\n\u201cHow much did you tell him?\u201d\nAtsumu grins, impish, and sets his tea down. \u201cProbably more than he wanted t\u2019know. It\u2019s not my fault, though! This shit\u2019s hard to explain to someone else without, like\u2026 some background, ya know?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m aware,\u201d Kiyoomi deadpans. He smirks when Atsumu flips him off. \u201cHow did you guys leave it, then? Everything go okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d Atsumu says, pulling out two plates.\u00a0\nHe hands one to Kiyoomi and they each begin filling their plates from the different trays Osamu brought. It\u2019s a companionable silence until Atsumu speaks again, sounding hesitant.\n\u201cI\u2026 I told him I\u2019ll probably have more ta tell him once m\u2019feeling better. Left it kinda open ended, since we, like\u2026 well, everything just happened.\u201d\nKiyoomi glances over at him. Atsumu is staring intently down at the takeout container of kushikatsu, twirling one of the skewers between his fingers. Kiyoomi isn\u2019t sure how to decipher exactly what Atsumu means by that. It\u2019s not a false statement by any means, but there\u2019s something fragile in Atsumu\u2019s voice that drives Kiyoomi to eye him curiously, but ultimately decide not to press him.\n\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d Kiyoomi says. He plucks the skewer from Atsumu\u2019s grip and places it on his plate, then gives him another one for good measure. \u201cWe can discuss details later. Probably not tonight, though. We have to get you feeling better first.\u201d\nAtsumu hums as he finishes plating his food. Kiyoomi follows suit.\u00a0\nAtsumu has a small dining table\u2014for when his mother comes to visit, is what he told Kiyoomi\u2014but generally prefers to eat on the couch. Kiyoomi normally finds this\u2026 distasteful, but is willing to make an exception today. Once Atsumu\u2019s settled in, Kiyoomi puts his own plate on the coffee table and doubles back to the fridge to grab two bottles of peach green tea, part of a six-pack that Osamu had brought.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s personally still working on his own iced oolong tea with passionfruit jelly, but Atsumu is already done with the drink Kiyoomi brought him.\n\u201cDo you have anything you want to watch while we eat?\u201d Kiyoomi asks, taking a seat on the couch.\nAtsumu holds up a finger while he finishes a steamed bun, cheeks bulging. Once he\u2019s done, he picks up the remote and navigates to an animated movie Kiyoomi\u2019s never heard of.\n\u201cThis was the movie Samu and I always watched as kids whenever we got sick and stayed home from school,\u201d he explains.\u00a0\nHe watches Atsumu fiddle with the label on the bottle of iced tea. Atsumu hadn\u2019t been receptive to touch when he first got here, but Kiyoomi had woken up with Atsumu leaning against his side and now finds himself struck by the urge to put his arm around Atsumu\u2019s shoulders. Some amount of contact has been beneficial for Atsumu\u2019s aftercare in the past, yes, but this\u2026 feels like more than that. Seeing Atsumu so upset and then nearly having him walk out of Kiyoomi\u2019s life, metaphorically, left him shaken.\nIn the aftermath, Kiyoomi wants him close.\nHe\u2019s never been one to beat around the bush, so once they finish their food, about fifteen minutes into the movie, he says, \u201cIf you want to lean against me, you can.\u201d\nAtsumu looks over at him, eyes crinkled at the corners. \u201cWow, what a warm invitation, Omi-Omi! I\u2019m honored.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Kiyoomi scowls. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, you d\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNever said I didn\u2019t wanna!\u201d Atsumu adds quickly, tucking his knees up and scooting over.\nKiyoomi lifts his arm up and lets Atsumu press close and lean his head against him. He settles his own arm over Atsumu\u2019s shoulders, but quickly finds that the angle is uncomfortable, maybe because they\u2019re roughly the same height. Instead, he bends his elbow and rests his hand on Atsumu\u2019s head instead. When Atsumu doesn\u2019t protest, Kiyoomi lightly curls his fingers into his hair for purchase.\nThe movie plays on like Kiyoomi\u2019s heart isn\u2019t about to beat out of his chest.\nSeveral minutes later, after Kiyoomi has progressed to gently playing with Atsumu\u2019s hair, he feels Atsumu start to shake. He glances down and is startled to see tears running down Atsumu\u2019s cheeks.\nKiyoomi immediately stills his hand. \u201cAtsumu?\u201d\n\u201cS-sorry,\u201d Atsumu gets out, wiping his cheeks furiously with his sleeve.\n\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d Atsumu shakes his head. \u201cCan I do anything?\u201d Another shake of the head. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nKiyoomi removes a travel packet of tissues from his pocket and hands it to Atsumu, who immediately wipes his eyes and blows his nose.\n\u201cDunno why m\u2019cryin\u2019...\u201d\nKiyoomi hums and starts running his hand through Atsumu\u2019s hair once more. \u201cThat\u2019s fine\u2026 that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBy the end of the movie, Atsumu\u2019s tears have long since dried and he\u2019s laughing along at the silly parts. Afterward, Kiyoomi has to get up and go to the bathroom thanks to all the tea he drank. It breaks the spell of intimacy that had settled around them; however, when he comes back out, Atsumu is smiling as he scrolls through something on his phone, and the smile stays on his face when he looks up at Kiyoomi.\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Kiyoomi starts, \u201cit\u2019s getting late. If you want, I brought stuff to stay over on the couch. Do you think that would help?\u201d\nAtsumu bites his lip and looks at him consideringly.\n\u201cI promise I won\u2019t be offended either way,\u201d Kiyoomi adds.\n\u201cUhm\u2026 I think... it might actually be good to have some time to myself now that I\u2019m feelin\u2019 better. You know, compared to the disaster I was the last couple days,\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cBut you c\u2019n stay if it\u2019s too late to drive\u2026\u201d\nKiyoomi waves him off. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. That\u2019s why I wanted to ask.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t lying; he really isn\u2019t offended. As long as Atsumu is feeling okay, Kiyoomi would absolutely prefer sleeping in his own bed rather than on someone else\u2019s couch. Vehemently.\nAfter they\u2019ve cleaned up from dinner and Kiyoomi is pulling his shoes on, he looks over at Atsumu consideringly. \u201cAtsumu.\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cWe have practice tomorrow and a game on Thursday.\u201d\nAtsumu frowns. \u201cI know, Omi-kun. I should be all better after a good night\u2019a sleep.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not\u2014I  mean, we have Friday off. If you want, we could try\u2026 going out. To a restaurant,\u201d Kiyoomi says slowly.\n\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA date,\u201d Kiyoomi finally spits out. \u201cWe could go on a date. Unless that\u2019s too soon.\u201d\nAtsumu grins. \u201cNaw, Friday should be good, but I\u2019ll let ya know if m\u2019not feelin\u2019 up to it. Wow, Omi-Omi, askin\u2019 me on a date! Don\u2019t waste any time, do ya?\u201d\nKiyoomi scowls at him and shoves his hands in the pockets of his coat. He hates that Atsumu\u2019s ability to not make everything a mockery is somewhat endearing.\n\u201cDo you have a\u2026 preferred place you like to go to?\u201d Kiyoomi elects to ignore him. \u201cSince you have more\u2026 experience with this.\u201d\nAtsumu\u2019s smile widens. Kiyoomi\u2019s scowl deepens.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter to me!\u201d Atsumu says cheerfully. \u201cPick any place ya like.\u201d\nHe seems to be done teasing Kiyoomi\u2026 for now. Kiyoomi nods and hefts his bag over his shoulder, then turns toward the door.\n\u201cOh, and Omi\u2026\u201d\u00a0\nKiyoomi turns around and his heart leaps up into his throat when he sees how close Atsumu is. They\u2019ve been this close\u2014 closer\u2014 many times before, but now, after everything, it feels different.\u00a0\nHis heart crashes back into his chest and beats furiously against his ribs when Atsumu leans forward and kisses his cheek, then steps back before Kiyoomi even has a chance to process it. He scratches the back of his neck, a little sheepish.\n\u201c...thanks. For everythin\u2019.\u201d\nKiyoomi blinks and feels his face heat. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u2026 it was the least I could do.\u201d\nAtsumu shoves his hands in the pockets of his sweatpants and grins. \u201cNo it wasn\u2019t. G\u2019night, Omi-kun.\u201d\nWalking down the hallway of Atsumu\u2019s apartment complex after he\u2019s said goodnight, Kiyoomi reaches up to touch his cheek and smiles, a small thing, hidden by a mask, but maybe visible in his eyes. After two inexplicably excruciating days, Kiyoomi can finally breathe again.\n\u00a0\n\n Pick any place you like.\u00a0 \n\nOriginally, Kiyoomi didn\u2019t take any issue with Atsumu\u2019s request. It shouldn\u2019t be difficult to select a restaurant. Even though he\u2019s never been on a  date  before, Kiyoomi isn\u2019t helpless and knows how to use google.\nHowever, once he got through reading a blog or two on good first date spots in Osaka, he started to second guess himself. Sure it\u2019s his and Atsumu\u2019s first real \u2018date\u2019, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019ll be the first time they\u2019ve eaten together. It\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve gone to a restaurant or cafe one on one. All the blogs seem to assume this is a stranger you\u2019re trying to impress. Not that Kiyoomi  isn\u2019t  trying to impress Atsumu, in a way. In fact, he\u2019d really like to make sure it goes well, considering what\u2019s at stake.\u00a0\nYet, what if Kiyoomi picks something too casual or way too fancy? What is the appropriate amount of upscale for \u2018 involved sexually for months and now going out to test the waters romantically\u2019 ?\nIt\u2019s\u2026 too complicated for Kiyoomi\u2019s experience level. So he does what he\u2019s always done when he\u2019s trying to learn something new and the internet has failed him. He calls upon someone more experienced.\u00a0\nKiyoomi takes a seat in the chair nearest his window and holds his phone to his ear as he hits \u2018call\u2019.\n\u201cHey, Kiyoomi,\u201d a familiar voice answers after only a few rings. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cMotoya,\u201d Kiyoomi greets in turn. He watches a seagull land on someone\u2019s balcony across the street. \u201cWhere would you take someone for a first date if you\u2019ve already known them for years?\u201d\n\u201cHmm, well, if you\u2019re already friends\u2014wait,  what?!  Oh, holy shit\u2014Kiyoomi, are you going on a date?!\u201d\nKiyoomi narrows his eyes, \u201cWhy would I be asking if I wasn\u2019t? It\u2019s this Friday, so I can\u2019t pick anywhere with an extended reservation list, either.\u201d\n\u201cNo, wait, stop,\u201d Motoya says, and Kiyoomi sighs as he hears the sparking mirth in his cousin\u2019s voice.  \u201c  Who are  you  going on a  date  with?!\u201d\n\u201cMotoya,\u201d Kiyoomi says reprovingly in response to Motoya\u2019s climbing excitement and volume.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no, no, I promise I\u2019ll help. I promise, but first you at  least  have to tell me who,\u201d Motoya says and Kiyoomi can almost see the way he must be bouncing with excitement.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why this is so fascinating to you,\u201d Kiyoomi says, suddenly feeling his cheeks heat a little as he realizes what he\u2019s going to have to say  out loud .\n\u201cOh,  come on , yes you do.\u201d\nKiyoomi presses his lips together and silence stretches out.\n\u201cKiyoomi\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMiya Atsumu,\u201d Kiyoomi spits it out, cutting Komori off.\u00a0\nThere are three full seconds that are so quiet Kiyoomi thinks the phone died. He pulls it away from his ear to check and suddenly hears, clearly, because it was shouted,  \u201cMiya Atsumu!?\u201d \nKiyoomi blinks and brings the phone back up to his ear, a few inches away in case Motoya decides to yell again.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Kiyoomi confirms.\n\u201cNo\u2014wait\u2014 Miya? Miya Atsumu?!  Your setter, Miya Atsumu?\u201d Motoya says in a rush, sounding like he\u2019s never been happier in his whole life. It\u2019s pretty rude, and that\u2019s coming from Kiyoomi. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. Holy shit. You finally date someone and it\u2019s  Miya Atsumu!  Kiyoomi!  \u201d \nIt\u2019s not even a question now, just howling glee.\u00a0\n\u201cWait, how did this even happen?!\u201d Motoya pivots, and Kiyoomi sighs.\n\u201cWe began a sexual relationship at the beginning of the season. That type of relationship by itself was no longer working, so we\u2019re\u2026 testing the waters,\u201d Kiyoomi says.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2014that\u2019s not what I meant, oh my  god\u2014 \u201d\n\u201cMotoya.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright. I won\u2019t ask any more right now, but I swear I\u2019m getting the entire story when we come out to play the Jackals next week.\u201d\n Unlikely,  Kiyoomi thinks to himself.\u00a0\n\u201cSo?\u201d he prompts.\n\u201cRight, okay. Date spots\u2026\u201d Motoya begins, finally,  finally  getting to the part where he actually helps.\nKiyoomi leans back in his chair and picks up his pen to take a few notes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the end, Kiyoomi ends up calling in to two separate restaurants. After a long twenty minutes of sitting on the phone while Komori googled restaurants and texted friends, his cousin had assured him that Yonemasu would be an absolute showstopper of a pick.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a kaiseki place that\u2019s getting crazy buzz right now. Like it might end up with a Michelin star soon, at least that\u2019s what this blog says,\u201d Motoya recited as Kiyoomi jotted down the name. \u201cAh, shit. It also says it\u2019s super hard to get a reservation, though. Sucks. Miya totally seems like the type to be into that sort of thing.\u201d\nThey ended up finding a highly recommended sushi restaurant thanks to one Suna Rintaro.\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. The nosy bastard asked why I was asking\u2014I told him you were looking for recommendations, but said I didn\u2019t know who you were taking out,\u201d Motoya preemptively assured. \u201cSince it\u2019s Miya and your first date and all.  God,  Miya! So hilarious\u2014sorry\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAppreciate it,\u201d Kiyoomi said, ignoring the resurging outburst.\u00a0\nThe thing was, he had the feeling Motoya was right about Atsumu being into a trendy restaurant that\u2019s spiking in popularity. So after calling the first restaurant, Kiyoomi channels all the affluent confidence instilled in him from childhood and calls Yonemasu on a whim and asks to be notified should any seats or tables open up for Friday evening.\nTo his surprise and vindication, Kiyoomi gets a call on Friday morning.\n\n \u201cSakusa-sama? I saw that you called on Tuesday looking for any availability at Yonemasu this evening\u2026\u201d \n\nKiyoomi texts Atsumu about the change in plans.\u00a0\nFrom:  Miya Atsumu\n&gt;&gt; I just looked it up and it looks really cool! Do you want to meet downtown or drive together?\nKiyoomi feels a mild wave of satisfaction roll over him at Atsumu\u2019s obvious interest in the new spot.\u00a0\nTo:  Miya Atsumu\n&gt;&gt; I can pick you up.\nHe assumes that\u2019s not exactly first-date traditional, but it\u2019s right on Kiyoomi\u2019s way and it\u2019s not like they\u2019ve never given each other rides before. Kiyoomi flicks over to a pair of unread messages he received from Komori while he was making breakfast.\u00a0\nFrom:  Komori Motoya\n&gt;&gt; Baby Kiyoomi\u2019s first date day!!!!\n&gt;&gt; Send me a picture of your outfit!\nTo:  Komori Motoya\n&gt;&gt; I\u2019m less than six months younger than you.\u00a0\nFrom:  Komori Motoya\n&gt;&gt; You know that\u2019s not the point!\nKiyoomi doesn\u2019t respond as he goes about his day, working out, cleaning his apartment, and eventually getting ready for the evening. At that point he does quietly take a photo of himself in the full length mirror in the bathroom, then sends it without commentary to Motoya. He\u2019s pretty confident in his ability to dress himself, with his upbringing, but he\u2019s sure Motoya will tell him if he got it wrong.\nHe readjusts the white button up, mostly covered by a navy sweater. He paired it with a set of charcoal slacks and a shiny pair of dark brown oxfords. It\u2019s not a three-piece suit or anything, but from what he read, that would be overdoing it a little. His phone buzzes. The first message is just about eight thumbs up emojis. Another one quickly follows.\nFrom:  Komori Motoya\n&gt;&gt; Oh! Wear the watch Okaasama got you for graduation!\u00a0\nKiyoomi hums and goes over to his closet, pulling out the flat drawer that holds his ties and a trio of watches that he almost never wears. He picks up the Grand Seiko, an opulent gift from his mother for Kiyoomi\u2019s college graduation. It\u2019s a simple, classic silver design with a cobalt face. He buckles the weighty band around his wrist and glances at himself one last time in the mirror.\u00a0\nWith that, he pulls on a scarf and peacoat and heads out the door.\n\u00a0\nAtsumu is quieter than usual on the way to the restaurant, Kiyoomi notices.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Kiyoomi asks. \u201cIf you were still feeling off, we could have rescheduled or done something lower key.\u201d\u00a0\nAtsumu seemed much better by practice on Wednesday, chirping Bokuto and Inunaki at every opportunity, and he\u2019d been absolutely on point during the game last night. Though, Kiyoomi supposes the adrenaline of preparing for a game could have just been a temporary stopgap with another comedown afterwards.\u00a0\nIn the passenger seat, Atsumu sits up straighter and starts waving Kiyoomi off.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no! I\u2019m not still dropped or anything,\u201d Atsumu assures him. \u201cJust in my own head a bit. It\u2019s an adjustment, you know? I really am excited to try this place out. The reviews are amazing. Have you been there before?\u201d\nThe conversation about the restaurant and Osaka hot spots takes them all the way to the parking garage and up to the doors of Yonemasu.\u00a0\n\u201cWelcome to Yonemasu. Do you have a reservation?\u201d the hostess greets them.\nKiyoomi gives his name and the hostess offers to take their coats. Atsumu removes his high collared jacket so Sakusa can get the first look at his chosen date attire. He\u2019s wearing a blue button up and a dark pair of windowpane-check pants. It\u2019s accented by a pair of tan leather boots and matching belt. Kiyoomi internally releases a sigh of relief that his own outfit seems to be in a similar ballpark of formality. He doubts Atsumu had to text anyone to get help, though.\u00a0\n\u201cOmi-kun?\u201d\u00a0\nKiyoomi\u2019s head snaps up and he realizes he was in his own head a bit, apparently staring at the narrow cut of Atsumu\u2019s pants. The man\u2019s face is dusted with pink and Kiyoomi feels the tip of his ears heat a little bit.\u00a0\nThe hostess is waiting to take them to their table, which they do manage to reach without further embarrassment.\u00a0\nQuickly, a waitress brings out a starter course and takes their drink orders. Kiyoomi just asks for lemon water and Atsumu asks for seltzer with lime.\n\u201cI only got water because I\u2019m driving. Feel free to order something alcoholic if you want,\u201d Kiyoomi says.\u00a0\n\u201cNah,\u201d Atsumu says, beginning to investigate the small dish in front of him. He takes a small bite and hums with pleasure before taking another bite. He looks up when he\u2019s finished chewing. \u201cI don\u2019t usually drink much this time of year. I like to clear out my system and start eating a lot of clean carbs and protein going into tournament season.\u201d\n\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Kiyoomi says, trying the dish himself\u2014it\u2019s pickled with some kind of sweet accent, enjoyable and refreshing.\n\u201cOnce the Emperor\u2019s Cup starts, it can get a little hard to remember to eat well and stuff,\u201d Atsumu continues, making an aside to thank the waitress who has brought out their beverages. \u201cEspecially if you\u2019re doin\u2019 any international tournaments or exhibition games. I usually can keep weight on okay during the regular season, but the past three years in a row I\u2019ve dropped at least 5 kilos by the end of tournament season. Anyway, not drinkin\u2019 much is just part of the whole buckling-down regimen. Plus, you\u2019re on flights a lot and alcohol suppresses the immune system, ya know.\u201d\nHe says the last with a wink in Kiyoomi\u2019s direction.\u00a0\nNormally Kiyoomi might add something to that, but he\u2019s distracted by the reminder that he and Atsumu have taken different paths professionally. Kiyoomi is still technically a rookie, even if his presence in Japan and Hinata\u2019s complete anonymity and certain youthful charm has made that fact little more than a footnote. He takes it as a compliment that he appears professional and stable enough that he\u2019s not been subjected to many of the usual inquiries about \u2018settling in\u2019 and \u2018getting his feet under him\u2019 faced by most other rookies.\u00a0\nStill, the collegiate schedule is much lighter than Div1\u2019s and he\u2019s yet to go directly into a long stretch of international travel after a dense season. It\u2019s a bit strange to think that Atsumu already has four years of professional volleyball under his belt.\u00a0\nKiyoomi fights off the natural instinct to narrow his eyes in mild contempt. Atsumu must misattribute the expression to his last teasing comment, because he chuckles and continues.\n\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been tabbed for some international play. I can\u2019t believe we haven\u2019t talked about this yet. You already locked in for any camps or national team stuff, yet?\u201d\nThe discussion of the post-season and various prep routines carries them through most of the meal, when the conversation dies down. Silence stretches out for a few minutes as the desert course comes out. Unused to wearing a watch, Kiyoomi fiddles with the heavy metal again. He glances down and is surprised to see that they\u2019ve already been at the restaurant for two hours.\u00a0\nWhen he glances back up, Atsumu seems to be staring intently at the candle in the center of the table. He finally realizes Kiyoomi is looking at him and almost jumps. He takes a bite of the finely decorated chocolate roll cake on his plate.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s been getting more and more fidgety since the fifth small plate or so, alternating between talking too fast and complete silence. Now Atsumu\u2019s shoulders are hunched in and he is refusing to hold eye contact. He mostly stares at his cake, hazarding quick glances up at Kiyoomi before taking a bite with his gaze averted. Kiyoomi\u2019s frown gets deeper and deeper.\u00a0\nHe might not know dates, but he knows pretty well when Atsumu is uncomfortable at this point.\u00a0\n\u201cOut with it,\u201d Kiyoomi finally says.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Atsumu says, sitting up straighter. He still doesn\u2019t meet Kiyoomi\u2019s eyes though.\u00a0\n\u201cYou seemed to be enjoying yourself earlier and now you\u2019re clearly not,\u201d Kiyoomi says bluntly.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, Omi-kun, this place is really amazing,\u201d Atsumu assures him, taking another bite of cake.\nKiyoomi glares and huffs a little. Well, that answer is easy enough to parse.\n\u201cThen it has to do with me,\u201d Kiyoomi says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think a date would be super complicated, but if I\u2019ve messed something up, please tell me.\u201d\nAtsumu sets his fork down and runs a hand through his hair.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it, Omi! I just can\u2019t get it outta my head that this whole date thing is somethin\u2019 that  I  wanted but not something  you  wanted at all,\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinkin\u2019 about it all week and I just can\u2019t wrap my head around how I\u2019m s\u2019posed to be okay with you dating me basically against yer will.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not against my will,\u201d Kiyoomi snaps.\nAtsumu sighs heavily, \u201cNo, I know I didn\u2019t, like\u2026 force ya, or blackmail ya. But part of datin\u2019 is knowing that someone wanted to see and spend time with you, ya know? And sure, maybe this is okay because it\u2019s not so different than what we normally do, but what about in a month or two when my Ma comes out to the city and wants to meet the guy I\u2019ve been seein\u2019, when she starts immediately badgerin\u2019 ya about yer family, and yer plans, and all that? It\u2019ll always be in the back of my mind that you  said  ya didn\u2019t want any of that.\u201d\nAtsumu looks frustrated and a little sad, and Kiyoomi feels a bubbling exasperation in his chest. He doesn\u2019t know how to make Atsumu understand, doesn\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard for people to wrap their head around this.\n\u201cI said I didn\u2019t  need  any of it,\u201d Kiyoomi begins petulantly.\u00a0\nHe looks around, desperately wracking his brain for a way to explain something so apparently complicated when words have never been his strong suit.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d Atsumu says, sounding aggravated.\u00a0\nKiyoomi scowls, eyes dropping to his nearly untouched piece of chocolate cake.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 like chocolate cake,\u201d Kiyoomi begins.\u00a0\n\u201cChocolate cake?\u201d\n\u201cJust\u2026 let me try to explain,\u201d Kiyoomi says, speaking slower than normal, trying to sort it all out in his head. \u201cLet\u2019s pretend I don\u2019t eat cake. I find the average cake sponge\u2026 well, average, and frosting is way too sugary. Eating cake would require me to change my meal plan and that\u2019s just not really worth it, since I\u2019m not that passionate about cake.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Atsumu says, brow furrowed.\u00a0\n\u201cIndependently, let\u2019s say I really,  really  liked chocolate\u2014chocolate bars were one of my favorite foods and not being able to eat them would negatively impact me,\u201d Kiyoomi says. \u201cNow, let\u2019s pretend, suddenly, there was no way to eat pure chocolate bars, or for whatever reason I couldn\u2019t eat them anymore.\u201d\nAtsumu\u2019s eyes are narrowed into slits but for once he keeps his mouth shut so Kiyoomi pushes on, finally catching his groove a little.\u00a0\n\u201cFrom that point onward the  only  way I could have chocolate, hypothetically, was in the form of cake,\u201d Kiyoomi says. \u201cSo at the minor expense of slightly adjusting my meal plan, I could have chocolate again. What would you do, if it were you?\u201d\nAtsumu still seems confused as hell but he does slowly answer, \u201cI\u2019d eat the cake.\u201d\nKiyoomi nods, fiddling with the watch under the table again.\u00a0\n\u201cAn obvious choice. An easy one. I wouldn\u2019t have changed my meal plan for strawberry or lemon cake, because even if I couldn\u2019t eat those things by themselves anymore, I don\u2019t like them enough to seek out and  adjust  my life to eat cake  just  to have those foods. But for chocolate, my hypothetical favorite food, I would,\u201d Kiyoomi says and then fights down a blush as he realizes the implication of those words. He pushes on. \u201cIn this metaphor the cake itself is dating, and the frosting is all the things that go along with it that I\u2019d rather avoid, like having to include someone else in your career decisions or the potential pain of a break-up. I never had an issue with the  dating  part itself\u2014the dinners, or meeting family, or whatever. It just wasn\u2019t something I felt I  needed  to make my life whole, so it seemed stupid to  search it out  when it had the potential for drawbacks that I was trying to avoid.\nBut, like I said, if the only way to have chocolate is in cake form, and the type of cake I\u2019m having is chocolate every time, then why wouldn\u2019t I enjoy it?\u201d\nAtsumu blinks and a light flush has risen to his cheeks.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 chocolate?\u201d he murmurs.\u00a0\nWell, when he says it like  that , it sounds embarrassing.\u00a0\nThe metaphor isn\u2019t perfect, but Kiyoomi refuses to go into too many more details and risk any further mortifying implications. He looks away, feeling his own face heat.\n\u201cYes, in this metaphor you\u2019re chocolate,\u201d Kiyoomi confirms. \u201cThe hassles and adjustments are minor in comparison, and I don\u2019t find dating objectionable, so that\u2019s why the decision was easy when the other option was only seeing you platonically, or worse, just professionally.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Atsumu says, fully blushing now. Kiyoomi scoops up a piece of his cake, just for something to do other than have to make eye contact. He hears a chuckle. \u201cYou look like you wanna die.\u201d\n\u201cLiking you is mortifying.\u201d\nAtsumu splutters, \u201cRude! Ya better be careful or I\u2019ll change my mind about invitin\u2019 ya back to my place after dinner.\u201d\nKiyoomi pauses in his chewing for a moment, considering that. He swallows, and deliberately and quietly takes another bite of his cake. He sits up straighter, the last of the flames on his face dying out.\n\u201cSo, what do you think of the cake?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAtsumu thinks he finally gets it. It\u2019s not certain, but he\u2019s starting to think he at least understands enough to go with the flow when Sakusa follows him up to his apartment, a familiar weekender slung over his shoulder.\u00a0\n\u201cKinda presumptuous,\u201d Atsumu teases him as they head towards the elevator.\nSakusa scowls. \u201cI\u2019ve kept an overnight bag in my car since we started meeting up regularly. I didn\u2019t bring it specifically for today.\u201d\n\u201cAh, always ready for all of this?\u201d Atsumu says, tossing Sakusa a sleazy glance over his shoulder and gesturing to himself as he unlocks the door.\n\u201cIs this how you usually flirt with dates? If so, I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019ve had much more success dating than I have,\u201d Sakusa says, deadpan.\u00a0\nAtsumu makes a weird sound somewhere between an offended gasp and a laugh. He throws his scarf at Sakusa\u2019s head. He shuts the door and takes two smooth steps towards the other man as Sakusa pulls the scarf away from his face. Atsumu\u2019s hands come up to slide the mask off his face and he successfully gets a finger under the elastic as he leans in for a kiss.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s then that he\u2019s met with a palm over his entire face.\n\u201cI\u2019m showering before,\u201d Sakusa says, Atsumu\u2019s lips still half puckered.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, okay, yeah, sure,\u201d Atsumu says, and notices the way Sakusa is hunched in on himself a little, his ears just a bit pink. \u201cI\u2019ll shower after?\u201d\nApparently, Sakusa still isn\u2019t onboard to hop right into spontaneous hook-ups, which isn\u2019t surprising once Atsumu gives himself a second to think about it. Sakusa\u2019s sharp nod leads Atsumu to believe he\u2019s read the situation right by committing to showering as well.\u00a0\nLuckily, Sakusa doesn\u2019t take long, so Atsumu only has time to have one minor freak-out and two bouts of overwhelming disbelief. He\u2019s about to hook up with Sakusa Kiyoomi. For all that they\u2019ve done together, what they\u2019re about to do now is completely different. Atsumu\u2019s palms itch when he thinks about the potential freedom to touch. \nAtsumu jumps when the bathroom door opens, startled out of the staredown he was having with the wall. He swallows thickly when he sees Sakusa, stomach suddenly so full of butterflies that he feels nauseous.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s dressed in a simple white t-shirt and a pair of boxer briefs, wavy curls still damp from the shower. Atsumu has never seen him so dressed down outside of a locker room shower, and the lack of a bunch of other beefy athletes really changes the effect. Sakusa looks\u2026 vulnerable. A blush ripples across Atsumu\u2019s cheeks and he finds himself unexpectedly tongue-tied.\u00a0\n\u201cShower\u2019s yours,\u201d Sakusa says.\nAtsumu nods, heading quickly down the hall. He has to dodge around Sakusa and almost shudders as the smell of freshly washed skin hits his nose. Atsumu knew he was gone for Sakusa, but the reality of it is so much stronger now that what he\u2019s been longing for is in his grasp.\u00a0\nAtsumu gives himself several pep talks in the shower, brushes his teeth for good measure, then heads back outside quickly, dressed to match Sakusa, before he can psych himself out. Atsumu loses another degree of sanity when he finds Sakusa sitting cross legged on his bed, illuminated by the bedside table lamp and the light coming in from the street. He seems to be gazing out the window, or maybe into space. He doesn\u2019t look over until Atsumu clicks off the hall light, slowly crossing the main studio towards the bed.\u00a0\nThis isn\u2019t how it usually goes when Atsumu hooks up with someone for the first time. Usually it\u2019s a lot more chaotic and less personal. He wonders if Sakusa knows he\u2019s inadvertently made this a lot more intimate than an early hook-up would be. Though, who\u2019s to say if that\u2019s because of Sakusa\u2019s habits or simply because seeing him exposed, in Atsumu\u2019s bed, makes his heart threaten to pound right through his chest.\u00a0\nAtsumu pauses at the edge of the bed.\n\u201cCan I?\u201d he asks.\nSakusa blinks up at him. He looks so  soft.  \u201cIt\u2019s your bed.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole,\u201d Atsumu chuckles, nerves breaking for long enough that he can put a knee down on the bed and reach out to tentatively cup Sakusa\u2019s neck.\u00a0\nHe pauses for the extra second to allow Sakusa to tilt his head back invitingly, and finally their lips meet.\u00a0\nAtsumu makes a soft noise at the gentle slide of Sakusa\u2019s lips against his own. He brushes his thumb over Sakusa\u2019s jawline and climbs fully onto the bed to brace himself over him, then shivers when Sakusa reaches up and tangles a hand into his hair, damp and unstyled.\u00a0\nHe feels Sakusa\u2019s other hand settle in the small of his back. Atsumu opens his mouth a little more and gently sucks on Sakusa\u2019s bottom lip, then hums when Sakusa\u2019s tongue brushes against the seam of his mouth. Atsumu pushes back with his own, deepening the kiss little by little until Sakusa is licking into his mouth, sucking on his tongue, tightening his hands on Atsumu\u2019s body and making the arm Atsumu\u2019s using to hold himself up feel weak.\nIt\u2019s lazy, unhurried\u2014Atsumu wants to take his time, just because he can, but independently of that, he doesn\u2019t want to push it too fast. He\u2019s been in this position multiple times before, sure, but never with the man underneath him. He\u2019s not  used to taking the lead with Sakusa.\nSo he kisses him until his lips are sore, swollen, until Sakusa\u2019s fingers are digging into the small of his back and clenched tightly in his hair, until they\u2019re both hard and pressing against each other through two layers of thin cotton. Atsumu grinds down gently, moaning softly into Sakusa\u2019s mouth as he waits for his hands to creep lower, to slip under the hem of his shirt.\nExcept Sakusa\u2019s hands don\u2019t move. He readjusts his grip every few minutes, but he doesn\u2019t make any move to pull Atsumu\u2019s shirt up, or his boxers down. Atsumu huffs in frustration and grinds down again, trying to respect Sakusa\u2019s boundaries and not take things any further than he\u2019s comfortable with. He breaks the kiss for a brief moment to pepper kisses along Sakusa\u2019s jawline, then a little lower on the sensitive skin of his throat. Sakusa moans and tugs on his hair, wriggling underneath him.\n\u201cAtsumu,\u201d Sakusa gasps.  Fuck, his name sounds good on Sakusa\u2019s lips like that. \u201cAtsumu, don\u2019t tease\u2026\u201d\nAtsumu pulls off from where he\u2019d been sucking a bruise into Sakusa\u2019s pale skin. \u201cM\u2019not teasin\u2019!\u201d\nSakusa frowns. \u201cYes you are.\u201d\n\u201cIf I\u2019m teasin\u2019, then you are too,\u201d Atsumu says, rolling his hips to bring attention to how hard they both are. \u201cWhy are both of us still wearin\u2019 clothes?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you haven\u2019t taken them off.\u201d\nAtsumu huffs. \u201cWhat\u2019s that s\u2019posed\u2019ta mean?\u201d\nTo his surprise, Sakusa\u2019s already-flushed cheeks darken. \u201cLook, I\u2026 I haven\u2019t really\u2026. I haven\u2019t really had that much vanilla sex, okay? I figured you\u2019d want something different than the usual arrangement\u2026 as in, I thought you would take the lead.\u201d\nOh, no\u2026 he\u2019s so  cute when he\u2019s flustered.\u00a0\n\u201cOmi-Omi,\u201d Atsumu coos, pecking a kiss onto his bitten-red lips, \u201cDont\u2019cha think it would\u2019ve been nice\u2019a you to tell me that beforehand? I\u2019ve been stressin\u2019 out tryin\u2019 not to overstep since we got in bed.\u201d\u00a0\nSakusa glares at the ceiling. He\u2019s nearly  pouting. Atsumu is delighted.\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve done much more than this before. And I, and everyone else you\u2019ve ever been alone with for more than five minutes, know you hook up because you love to talk about it,\u201d Sakusa says eventually. \u201cSo why are you stressed out?\u201d\nAh, now it\u2019s Atsumu\u2019s turn to feel flustered. He leans down to bury his head in Sakusa\u2019s shoulder, giving himself a little time to think while he savors the warmth of Sakusa\u2019s body pressed tightly to his own, and shivers when he feels Sakusa\u2019s lips move along the column of his throat.\u00a0\n\u201cFirst of all, m\u2019not that easy, Omi. It takes at least ten minutes.\u201d Atsumu starts with a half hearted joke, but then lets the humor fall away completely. He mumbles, \u201cM\u2019just\u2026 not used to bein\u2019 anywhere close to  in charge  with you. Anything I do feels like overstepping, or like I\u2019m breakin\u2019 the rules.\u201d\n\u201cAtsumu,\u201d Sakusa snaps. He tugs on Atsumu\u2019s hair until Atsumu stops hiding against the crook of his neck. \u201cYou  know  me. Do you trust me to tell you if I don\u2019t like something you\u2019re doing?\u201d\nAtsumu wonders what it says about him that Sakusa\u2019s semi-pissed-off expression is turning him on even more. \u201c...Yes.\u201d\n\u201cThen there\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Sakusa says firmly, then adds, \u201cAt least not on my end.\u201d\nHe slides his other hand down to cup Atsumu\u2019s ass, then gives it a little pat. Atsumu makes an indignant noise and lunges for his lips again, emboldened after their short talk. Once he reaches down to grasp the hem of Sakusa\u2019s shirt, though, Atsumu breaks the kiss again.\n\u201cOmi?\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 take the lead, but\u2026 can you, uh, encourage me a little?\u201d Atsumu asks, barely getting the words out through his embarrassment.\u00a0\nGod, he sounds so  tentative. How can four months of kinky sex have changed him this much? He hopes vanilla sex will be like riding a bike, once he actually gets on the damn bike.\u00a0\nTo make matters worse, Sakusa  grins.\u00a0 \n\u201cI should\u2019ve known,\u201d he murmurs, squeezing Atsumu\u2019s ass through his boxers and pulling his hips down in a slow grind. \u201cPraise is very motivating for you.\u201d\n\u201cShut  up, \u201d Atsumu snaps, but he doesn\u2019t deny it, face burning as he sits up indignantly and pulls his own shirt off in one fluid motion. He straightens his spine for a second, posturing just a little. He tugs at the hem of Sakusa\u2019s shirt next. \u201cOff, off.\u201d\nSakusa\u2019s grin only deepens as he draws the shirt up his torso. Atsumu helps him get it over his head, then flings it to the side as he leans down to kiss him again. The broad expanse of Sakusa\u2019s chest and abdomen is now Atsumu\u2019s to explore and he does so enthusiastically, running his hands all over the sharp planes and savoring the soft sigh Sakusa makes when Atsumu\u2019s thumb brushes over one of his nipples.\nAtsumu pinches gently, a thrill running through him when Sakusa arches up against him and sighs again. \u201cYeah, just like that\u2026\u201d\nOh, fuck. Atsumu ducks down to mouth over his neck and finds his other nipple too, gently circling them and making Sakusa whine. He slides his tongue over warm, clean skin, licking across a collarbone before nuzzling the hollow of his throat. Sakusa\u2019s hands both drop to his ass, squeezing again before playing with the waistband of his boxers, and Atsumu moans and sits up again to shuck them off.\n\u201cAtsumu,\u201d Sakusa whispers. \u201cTouch me.\u201d\nAtsumu nearly trips over himself trying to get Sakusa\u2019s underwear off, exposing him fully. He swallows harshly, reaching out; Sakusa has such a nice dick and it\u2019s a rush to be able to touch it freely. Atsumu thumbs over the wet head and shifts forward, Sakusa\u2019s thighs spreading effortlessly apart to accommodate his hips.\nAfter only a few slow strokes, Atsumu realizes he needs to get the lube. As he leans over to his bedside table, Sakusa says, \u201cGrab some condoms, too. I want you to fuck me.\u201d\nGoosebumps break out down Atsumu\u2019s back and he nods, an embarrassingly breathy  yeah  escaping him as he retrieves both. How can Sakusa say that so casually? Atsumu said he wanted encouragement, sure, but he was thinking more along the lines of  \u201cyeah, like that,\u201d  or  \u201cmore, more,\u201d not multiple full sentences.\nAs he squeezes some lube out onto his fingers, Atsumu realizes that what he really wants is for Sakusa to be a little less coherent.\u00a0\nSakusa sighs when Atsumu wraps his hand back around him, now warm and slick as he strokes up and down, making dirty wet noises every time he slides his grip over the head. He bites two of his knuckles to muffle a quiet groan when Atsumu circles his thumb around the slit and speeds up, cupping his balls and rolling them in his other hand.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, Omi,\u201d Atsumu murmurs, watching him greedily. \u201cI wanna hear ya.\u201d\nSakusa glares at him but moves his hand away from his mouth, fisting it in one of Atsumu\u2019s pillows instead. Atsumu flashes his signature grin and switches to using both hands to jerk him off, twisting his wrists and biting his lip as Sakusa squirms under his touch.\u00a0\nHe grins at Sakusa\u2019s first actual moan, a breathy little thing that comes when Atsumu leans in and rubs their cocks together, his wet hands slipping over both of them. Sakusa reaches down and takes hold of Atsumu\u2019s wrist\u2014not to stop him, but to encourage his movements.\n\u201cYeah, ya like that?\u201d Atsumu asks, thrusting his hips forward. Sakusa just moans again.\nAtsumu bites his lip, gut twisting as Sakusa\u2019s dick slides against his own. That\u2019s more like it.\nOnce the lube has gotten tacky, Atsumu reaches for it again; this time, he generously coats the fingers of his right hand and tosses the bottle onto the sheets, then backs up a bit and spreads Sakusa\u2019s cheeks with his other hand, grinning at the little hole he finds clenched up tight. Is this really going to be his first time fingering Sakusa? Atsumu needs to make up for lost time.\nWhen Sakusa seems to realize what Atsumu\u2019s about to do, he holds up a hand to stop him. \u201cWait, Atsumu\u2014condom\u2014\u201d\nHe\u2019s definitely less coherent, which was Atsumu\u2019s goal. But what does he\u2026  oh. \nAtsumu remembers when Sakusa came over on New Year\u2019s Day and used a condom to cover his fingers while he opened him up. After that, Atsumu had gone out to the store and bought a small package of gloves, just in case. Now, it seems that Sakusa\u2019s desire for some sort of barrier extends to Atsumu\u2019s fingers as well.\u00a0\nAtsumu can work with that. He grins.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do ya one better.\u201d\nHe smears the lube on Sakusa\u2019s abs for safekeeping, ignoring the affronted noise he gets in response, and reaches for the bedside table once more to pull out the packet of gloves. Sakusa\u2019s eyes widen and Atsumu\u2019s chest puffs out a little as he extracts a single glove from the pack and dons it. Then he coats it in the lube and gets back into position, rubbing a single slick finger over Sakusa\u2019s hole.\n \u201cNnnh,  fuck,\u201d Sakusa gasps, spreading his legs wider as Atsumu draws little circles.\u00a0\nAtsumu bites his lip and presses inside.\nHe opens up like a dream, relaxing quicker than Atsumu expected under his careful touch. There\u2019s a strange, extra thrill running through him as he watches his gloved fingers slide in and out of where Sakusa is so sensitive. He assumes stopping in the middle of sex to pull on a latex glove would be kind of a boner killer to some people, but to Atsumu it\u2019s sending him on some sort of weird power trip. They don\u2019t use gloves all the time for every scene, these days, but they\u2019re still such a  symbol  in Atsumu\u2019s head.\n\u201cHurry up,\u201d Sakusa snaps breathily, making Atsumu realize that he\u2019d been in a sort of daze.\u00a0\n\u201cPatience, Omi,\u201d Atsumu says, trying to play it off like deliberate foreplay instead of giving away how bewitched he feels.\u00a0\nHe pulls his fingers out and peels the glove off, with a conflushing flash of regret he decides to put aside to examine later.\u00a0\nSakusa throws a condom in his direction in response to Atsumu\u2019s request. He catches it with only a mild fumble, then rips it open and slides it down his length. Atsumu drags in a rough breath and takes in the image of Sakusa below him, feet planted on the bed, held up on his elbows, staring Atsumu down.\u00a0\n\u201cAtsumu.  Fuck me ,\u201d Sakusa reiterates.\nAtsumu nods, deciding in that moment that he\u2019s  going to deliver. He lines up and shifts his hips gently but unrelentingly forward. Sakusa grits his teeth and drops his head back. Atsumu doesn\u2019t give him a chance to complain again, letting him adjust with a few shallow thrusts before sliding an arm around Sakusa\u2019s lower back and thrusting slowly all the way to the hilt.\nHe watches with heat-fogged eyes as Sakusa collapses backwards, fingers twisting in the sheets as he\u2019s filled, as  Atsumu fills him up.\u00a0\nAtsumu hooks an arm under Sakusa\u2019s knee to change the angle and sets a relentless pace\u2014a steady one, rolling in and out with a dirty grind at its apex, only made possible by a career that demands peak physical condition.\nSakusa gasps as the first thrust drives home. Atsumu feels dizzy, drunk and over-indulged; he leans down and buries his face in Sakusa\u2019s neck. His forehead against the bed helps him balance enough to use a free hand to explore Sakusa\u2019s skin, which is getting rapidly slicker with sweat. Thorough strokes over ripcord pectorals and abdominals elicit low moans from both of their mouths.\u00a0\nThe room went from quiet and intimate to a desperate inferno much quicker than Atsumu had planned. He\u2019d wanted to take his time, but the way their bodies fit and move together is making it difficult to resist anything but his most base instincts.\u00a0\nHe reaches down to give Sakusa\u2019s cock a couple twisting pulls. Atsumu then drops his hand flat against Sakusa\u2019s skin so he can slide his thumb under Sakusa\u2019s sack to press upward. Atsumu grins into his neck as he hears Sakusa gasp and swear, his prostate caught between the intermittent press of Atsumu\u2019s dick and thumb. Atsumu silently sends a prayer of thanks to the pre-med student that taught him that move.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck, don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop,\u201d Sakusa moans.\nLike Atsumu would ever dream of that.\nHe whines when Sakusa digs his nails into his back, pinpoint sources of pain that make his gut twist. Atsumu pants into the sheets and drives in harder, biting his lip and trying to last through the crushing heat that\u2019s squeezing his cock with every thrust. Sakusa\u2019s gasping into his ear, little choked-off noises that have Atsumu biting his lip, then turning his head to the side to bite Sakusa\u2019s neck.\n \u201cShit  \u2014  Atsumu \u2014\u201d\nAtsumu has a good angle, so he abandons pressing behind Sakusa\u2019s balls in favor of drawing his hand up and circling shaking fingers around his dick.\n\u201cOmi,\u201d Atsumu breathes, his own voice loud in his ears as all of the sensations in his body start to condense, \u201cplease tell me yer close\u2014\u201d\nSakusa nods, something like a sob sticking in his throat. His pulse is racing under Atsumu\u2019s lips. Atsumu mumbles something like  thank fuck and starts to stroke him, trying his best to match up with the rhythm of his hips. Thank god he has a lot of practice holding back his own orgasm, because he wants Sakusa to come first.\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Atsumu coaxes him, \u201cc\u2019mon, that\u2019s it\u2014wanna feel ya come around me\u2014please, Omi\u2014 please \u2014\u201d\nHe gasps as Sakusa tightens sharply around him. Then there\u2019s wetness spilling over Atsumu\u2019s fingers and Sakusa is clinging to him even tighter as a moan tears from his chest, arching into Atsumu\u2019s body as he comes. It\u2019s so hot that Atsumu\u2019s orgasm slams into him without giving him a choice, pleasure sweeping over him as he comes into the condom and groans into Sakusa\u2019s shoulder.\nFor a little while, all Atsumu can do is breathe, blinking in awe as he comes down. Sakusa\u2019s grip on his back loosens, then vanishes completely as his arm flops down to the bed.\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Sakusa mumbles.\nHuh. Guess it was like riding a bike.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait, Omi\u2026\u201d Atsumu says into the dark.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201c...Was this yer first time havin\u2019 vanilla sex? Oh my god, did I take your vanilla virginity?\u201d\nSakusa jabs an elbow back and Atsumu wheezes when it connects with his stomach. \u201cWhat? No!\u201d\n \u201cGeez, yer elbows are bony,\u201d Atsumu laughs. \u201cAlright, alright.\u201d\nHe chuckles and cuddles up against him again, burying his face in the nape of his neck. This means he hears Sakusa\u2019s voice rumble in his throat when he says, \u201cIf you must know, this was my second time.\u201d\nAtsumu perks up. \u201cOho? When was the first time, then? Are ya gonna share with the class?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m still deciding,\u201d Sakusa deadpans.\n \u201cOmiiii, c\u2019mon!\u201d\nSakusa huffs. \u201cFine. The first time was when I lost my  actual  virginity.\u201d\nAtsumu waits for him to elaborate, but he doesn\u2019t. \u201cOmi, yer killin\u2019 me. Who was it? Do I know them?\u201d He hears Sakusa sigh, then feels a little bad. \u201cAh, ya don\u2019t have to tell me if ya don\u2019t wanna. This is kinda weird pillow talk anyway\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIizuna Tsukasa,\u201d Sakusa says.\nAtsumu pauses while the name runs through his head. \u201cIizuna\u2026 the Hornets\u2019 setter?\u201d\nThe name rings a bell for a different reason, but Atsumu can\u2019t quite remember why.\u00a0\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s the setter for the Hornets now, but he was\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYer captain,\u201d Atsumu makes the connection before Sakusa can say it. \u201cIn high school, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sakusa says.\nAtsumu blinks. There are a few seconds of silence. Then:\n\u201cAre you  kiddin\u2019  me? You fucked yer high school captain? You gave me shit for  wantin\u2019  to fuck  my  captain when you actually went ahead and  did it?\u201d\nSakusa laughs quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t see how that\u2019s relevant. You definitely weren\u2019t complaining about me \u2018giving you shit\u2019 at the time.\u201d\n\u201cOh my  god.\u201d Atsumu tries to keep acting affronted, but he can\u2019t keep the laughter out of his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re such a dick.\u201d\n\u201cSo are you,\u201d Sakusa says evenly. \u201cI think it balances out.\u201d\nAtsumu snorts and hides a smile against the nape of Sakusa\u2019s neck. He\u2019s not wrong. He\u2019s definitely not wrong.\u00a0"
