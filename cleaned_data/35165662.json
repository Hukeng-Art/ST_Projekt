    "text": "There were few things in life that Flash hated; he hated when his pizza gets cold on his run back home, he hated when they messed up his order and he had to run all the way back to Italy on an empty stomach, and he hated waiting.\nWaiting was probably the worst, because while the other two had quick and easy fixes, waiting didn\u2019t. He also found himself having to wait for something a lot more than the other two combined.\nAll of this is to say, he wasn\u2019t having a good time.\nThe lingering smell of fish had him sick, or maybe that was the blood loss? Batman was knocked out next to him and Wonder Woman was bound by her own lasso. The bomb in front of him showed five minutes left. Great.\nFive minutes would\u2019ve been plenty of time for Batman or even Barry to disable the bomb (or at least get it away so it could blow up safely) but with the meta-cuffs around his wrist he couldn\u2019t do anything.\nIf only they were normal cuffs, then the stab wound in his abdomen would\u2019ve already healed and the bullet that grazed his thigh would\u2019ve stopped burning.\nFlash looked up, staring at the exposed steel beams as he prayed to every deity he knew.\n\n Rao, please save us. \n\n\n Zeus, please- no not Zeus, he\u2019s a cheater and just a terrible dude. Wait, can he hear me? Please don\u2019t smite us! Not that it would really do anything anyway, we\u2019re about to be blown up. \n\nHe looked down at the bomb again, only to see\u2026 Nightwing?\nWhat was he doing here? Had Batman called for help? That wouldn\u2019t be very Batman of him, but then again, adopting upwards of 14 children wasn\u2019t very Batman of him either.\nNightwing stopped the bomb and walked over to Flash, taking off his cuffs.\nImmediately he started feeling better, his body finally starting to heal itself.\n\u201cThanks for the assist,\u201d Flash said, trying to be good-humoured but only succeeding in sounding pained.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Diana demanded as he saved her.\n\u201cNightwing, Bl\u00fcdhaven vigilante,\u201d he said, with something between a salute and a wave.\nBarry recognised it as the formal \u2018hello\u2019 in ASL.\nEver since meeting Black Bat he had started learning ASL in case he met her again.\n\u201cThank you for saving us, Nightwing of Bl\u00fcdhaven.\u201d Diana rubbed her wrists together and gathered her lasso.\n\u201cNo problem Wonder Woman, I was in the neighbourhood anyway,\u201d he said, sending her a mega-watt smile that would\u2019ve made Superman squint.\n\u201cAre you taking Batman to your super-secret base?\u201d Nightwing asked, a knowing glint in his eyes that everyone would\u2019ve missed. Except Barry knew that he knew much more than he was letting on.\n\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded. Nightwing\u2019s shoulders shagged almost imperceptibly.\n\u201cWell, good luck!\u201d he said, waving and back-flipping away.\nOnce he was gone, they turned to Batman and Wonder Woman gathered his unconscious body in her arms.\n\u201cHe would make a fine addition,\u201d Wonder Woman mumbled, it was more to herself than anyone else and Barry doubts he was supposed to hear it.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nIt was a couple days later that Barry finds out what she meant, they were having a security meeting, it wasn\u2019t too important as it was just a small update to the fire system so most of the League wasn\u2019t there.\nBatman, who usually tried to join every meeting no matter how miniscule, was busy dealing with the latest Arkham break-out so he wasn\u2019t there.\nSuperman and Wonder Woman were though.\n(So were Flash, Green Arrow and Martian Manhunter, but they aren\u2019t as important).\nThe thing with the League was, they liked to know about all the new heroes, which could be difficult when heroes were popping up every day.\nThey also tried to recruit (or at least establish a connection so they could call on them if there was an emergency, like an alien invasion) all the new heroes.\nBut not just anyone could become a full member with Watchtower clearance, so to get that you needed the okay from the majority of the founders (Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman).\n\u201cI would like to recruit Bl\u00fcdhaven\u2019s new hero, his name is Nightwing, and he was able to stop a bomb in twenty seconds,\u201d Wonder Woman said with all the authority of a princess.\n\u201cYou want to recruit Nightwing?\u201d Flash asked, eyes wide as he stared at her like she had grown another head.\n\u201cThe League is in need of more people who can dismantle bombs,\u201d she said.\nOh God, Batman would hate this. He had worked so hard to keep his identity and the identity (even the existence) of his children safe and it was all going down the drain.\nJust because he wasn\u2019t here.\nOh God.\n\u201cI feel like we should wait till Batman is here to discuss this,\u201d Flash said, desperately trying to\u2026 well he wasn\u2019t quite sure. He was just knew he had to do something.\n\u201cWe only need two members for him to be given access to the Watchtower,\u201d Wonder Woman said.\n\u201cHe saved your life once and you already want to give him access to the Watchtower?\u201d Flash said, truly stunned at how easily she was trusting him.\n\u201cI am a great judge of character.\u201d She crossed her arms, levelling him with a glare only slightly less scary than that of Batman.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a wonderful idea, currently we only have two members who can actually disarm a bomb. No Superman, flying it into space doesn\u2019t count,\u201d Green Arrow said.\n\u201cThen it\u2019s settled,\u201d Superman said, only looking a tiny bit sheepish at the comment.\nThat\u2019s how Nightwing was recruited, without Batman\u2019s knowledge.\nThis wasn\u2019t going to end well.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBarry had done everything in his power to be there when Superman and Wonder Woman went out searching for Nightwing to recruit him.\n\n\nBoth of them were very confused as to why he wanted to be there so bad, as he was the one who was the most against it.\n\n\nThey, of course, didn\u2019t know about how Barry already knew him.\n\n\nThey settled on top of the roof of a building, it had been Barry\u2019s idea so they could \u201csee further\u201d but he knew that was a lie. Nightwing was trained by Batman, they would only find him if he wanted to be found.\n\n\nBeing on a roof might make him feel safe, Batman has all his business dealings on a roof, maybe it\u2019s genetic? Well, not genetic\u2026 it\u2019s like magic, as soon as the adoption papers are signed you become a bat and suddenly rooftops become a second home.\n\n\nHe was proven right when a couple of minutes later a figure stepped out of the shadows.\n\n\n\u201cTo what do I owe the pleasure?\u201d he asked, though the sentence was very polite, his voice had a slight edge to it. Like he was threatening them whilst also greeting them.\n\n\nDoes intimidation also get transferred over when the adoption papers are signed?\n\n\n\u201cNightwing, when you saved us, I was impressed by your abilities. I believe you have what it takes to someday become a great hero, we would like you to join the League,\u201d Wonder Woman said, stepping forward.\n\n\n\u201cWait, just like that? You\u2019re letting me on the team, just like that?\u201d his eyes narrowed like he didn\u2019t quite believe them.\n\n\nFlash needed to send him some kind of message, something that says, \u201cBatman doesn\u2019t know anything\u201d whilst also saying \u201cDon\u2019t join just to make fun of your dad!\u201d.\n\n\nTeenagers were scary like that. Nightwing technically wasn\u2019t a teenager anymore, he was probably around Wally\u2019s age.\n\n\nWas Wally an adult?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nIt was his first day of high school not too long ago.\n\n\n\u201cYou only need two votes from the founding members to be given membership, Superman and Wonder Woman have both given you the okay. Batman hasn\u2019t been notified yet,\u201d Flash said, trying his hardest to speak with his (white out) eyes.\n\n\nHe probably shouldn\u2019t have said that, because immediately Nightwing perked up, a smirk appearing on his face.\n\n\n\u201cI thank you for your offer, I am very surprised super-powered heroes like you want little old me to join. But I would be honoured.\u201d He bowed playfully, entirely too self-satisfied.\n\n\n\u201cIn a week we will meet back here at 4 pm, then you will be able to meet the rest of the League and gain access to the Watchtower,\u201d Superman said with a smile.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d Then he jumped off the building, and Flash died a little.\n\n\nWhat would Batman say about this? He would definitely kill him. RIP Barry Allen, died in the hands of Batman. In happier news, making Batman disregard his \u2018no killing\u2019 rule would be one of the most impressive feats of his life.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n---\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe next day Barry was chilling in the Watchtower, Hal and Oliver were on Watchtower duty and it was always fun to see the things they would come up with.\n\n\nThat\u2019s when the robotic voice of the Zeta-beam called out.\n\n\n\u201cB01,\u201d it said, \nlike that was completely normal. Like that was natural. Like everyone knew that the designation \u2018B\u2019 existed. Like Batman would let anyone other than him be number one.\n\n\nOliver and Hal both ran out of the security room, following Barry (at a much slower pace) towards the zeta platform.\n\n\nWhere Nightwing was.\n\n\nHe was just standing there.\n\n\nLike the fact that he had somehow found their super-secret base that was \n\nin space\n\n, wasn\u2019t anything impressive or extraordinary.\n\n\nBarry was going to faint.\n\n\nAgain.\n\n\nHow had Batman\u2019s family already made him faint twice in the three months he\u2019d known of their existence?\n\n\nWell, he hadn\u2019t fainted yet.\n\n\nSo only once.\n\n\n\u201cHow did you gain access to this place?\u201d Oliver asked, eyes wide as he stared at the newcomer.\n\n\n\u201cI could\u2019ve hacked it, I could\u2019ve asked one of my friends to hack it.\u201d He started counting on his fingers the different ways he could\u2019ve gotten in.\n\n\n\u201cDoes you-know-who know you\u2019re here?\u201d Barry asked.\n\n\nMaybe he was growing old, or maybe this kid reminded him too much of Wally.\n\n\nIf Wally had been raised by Batman.\n\n\nBut his dad-senses were tingling, going off in every direction as every atom in his body was pushing him to get this child out of here.\n\n\nBatman had gone through so much to keep his children safe and off the Leagues radar.\n\n\nAnd now it was all about to go down the drain.\n\n\n\u201cOf course not, I would be grounded for life.\u201d Nightwing scoffed, strolling languidly into the living area, and sitting on the couch.\n\n\n\u201cGreen Arrow, Green Lantern,\u201d he said, nodding at the two heroes who were still frozen in place.\n\n\n\u201cThis is Nightwing, the newest member, he wasn\u2019t supposed to be introduced or even be here yet.\u201d Flash sent a harsh glare towards Nightwing, he doubts it did much though, the guy has grown up with \n\nBatman\n\n, the only thing that scares him is\u2026 well, nothing, probably.\n\n\nHell is probably scared of \n\nhim\n\n (not only is he the son of Batman, but he\u2019s also a Gothamite, people like that don\u2019t get sent to hell, they have their own place) and he doubts a vigilante is scared of death.\n\n\n\u201cHow did you even know about this place?\u201d Oliver asked, genuinely confused as he sat on the chair closest to the couch. A dazed expression on his face.\n\n\n\u201cI know a lot of things.\u201d He shrugged. Was this a bat thing? Did the magical adoption papers also make you purposefully vague?\n\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re the guy that impressed Wonder Woman by disarming a bomb?\u201d Hal asked, sitting down on Oliver\u2019s chair that was way too small for them both.\n\n\nBarry decided to be a functioning adult and sit down beside Nightwing on the huge sofa that could easily fit at least ten people and was made of some kind of silk-like material that was both soft and hard at the same time because Batman was extra like that.\n\n\nHe had read some theories that Batman was dating Bruce Wayne (a famous billionaire who people thought had an adoption problem, clearly, they had never met Batman. But if they were dating then maybe all of those kids were actually \n\ntheir\n\n kids. Don\u2019t go down this route Barry, it will only lead to a headache) so maybe he got his like of unnecessarily extravagant things from him.\n\n\n\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019ve been known to be very\u2026 disarming,\u201d he said, sending them a smile that belonged on the cover of a magazine.\n\n\nNote to self: never let Nightwing and Wally meet.\n\n\n\u201cHow long have you been a hero?\u201d Oliver asked.\n\n\n\u201cVigilante, technically,\u201d Nightwing corrected, \u201cI\u2019ve been at it for a while now, longer than you probably.\u201d He grinned.\n\n\n\u201cI might look young, but it\u2019s been a while since I was twenty,\u201d Oliver said with a laugh.\n\n\n\u201cThe beard doesn\u2019t do much to hide your old-age Ollie,\u201d Nightwing mumbled, if Barry hadn\u2019t been sitting beside him, he wouldn\u2019t have heard him at all.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you guys even do up here?\u201d Nightwing asked, changing the subject about as smoothly as sandpaper.\n\n\n\u201cKeep an eye on the world, hide from Bats, nothing too exciting,\u201d Hal said, leaning back in the chair.\n\n\n\u201cHide from bats?\u201d Nightwing asked, raising an eyebrow, his domino mask moving with his face.\n\n\nThis was just great. Were they about to start gossiping about Nightwing\u2019s dad \n\nwith\n\n Nightwing?\n\n\n\u201cBatman, scary dude. I\u2019ve never seen him lose a fight, he swears he isn\u2019t a meta but I\u2019m not so sure,\u201d Oliver said, leaning forward in his seat like they were conspiring against someone.\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d his voice had the tiniest hint of a laugh he was suppressing.\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not scare the new guy,\u201d Barry said, trying to salvage the situation.\n\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s going to be working with us, he needs to know,\u201d Hal argued, also leaning forward so he could join their conspiring.\n\n\n\u201cBats is terrifying, he trains us for hours which leaves everyone, even Wonder Woman, tired and bruised. I\u2019ve never heard him give a compliment before,\u201d Oliver said, lowering his voice like he was telling a deep, dark secret.\n\n\n\u201cSounds rough,\u201d Nightwing said, sounding genuinely surprised.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get into his personal space and you should be fine, he has a strict no-killing rule so you shouldn\u2019t worry too much, though his punches are known to be a fate worse than death,\u201d Hal said.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d\n\n\u201cB01,\u201d the zeta called out, he was early by a couple of minutes but most of the leaguers had already arrived.\nThe three founders were there, and Flash, Green Lantern, Green Arrow, Martian Manhunter and Aquaman were also there.\nThey were still missing Hawkgirl and Black Canary, who had both said they would be a few minutes late (they had been on a mission together that took longer than expected).\n\u201cNightwing? Is something the matter?\u201d Batman asked, standing up as he walked towards his son.\nHis son.\nThe son he didn\u2019t know had joined the League and would be joining them on dangerous missions.\n\u201cNope!\u201d he said, popping the p.\n\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d Batman asked, his shoulders were stiff, and his fists were clenched.\n\u201cWell, as the newest League member it\u2019s important to be on time,\u201d Nightwing said, his smile was bright as he walked past Batman and towards the rest of the League.\n\u201cNightwing, I have prepared a chair next to mine for you to sit on,\u201d Wonder Woman said, gesturing to the folding chair next to hers.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, sitting down.\nBatman stood there, in silent shock for a second before sitting in his chair at the head of the table again.\n\u201cYou know Nightwing?\u201d Superman asked, his farm-boy accent shining through.\n\u201cWe\u2019re\u2026 acquainted,\u201d Batman said.\n\u201cBl\u00fcdhaven is Gotham\u2019s sister city,\u201d Nightwing supplied.\n\u201cOur paths have crossed,\u201d Batman said, eying Nightwing from the corner of his eye.\n\u00a0\nThe meeting had been uneventful, Canary and Hawkgirl had arrived just as they had finished talking about security and were moving on to budget.\nMore specifically, budget cuts.\n\u201cWhat do you mean budget cut? Aren\u2019t you guys funded by the government?\u201d Nightwing asked.\n\u201cYes, well, Zeta-beam maintenance isn\u2019t cheap,\u201d Superman said.\n\u201cPlease, your Zeta\u2019s only cost you 100-thousand dollars a year,\u201d Nightwing said, narrowing his eyes.\nIf Flash hadn\u2019t known what he knew about Nightwing, he would\u2019ve wondered how he knew exactly how much money they spent on Zeta maintenance.\n\u201cWe pay for the repairs of a lot of buildings when there is an alien or robot invasion. That and the diplomatic trips we have to take to alien planets take most of our money,\u201d Batman said, a tired sigh escaping him.\n\u201cSo, we have to go back to the cheap coffee?\u201d Canary asked, looking more distraught than she should.\n\u201cI will pay for the coffee myself, there is no way I\u2019m going back to that stuff,\u201d Green Arrow said.\n\u201cWe have to do something much more drastic than just switch over to cheap coffee\u2026 there will be no more donut-care-Friday,\u201d Batman said, his deep gravelly voice not really suiting the pun he made.\nBut it got the right reaction as everyone broke out into screams.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious!\u201d Hawkgirl exclaimed.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid Taco Tuesdays will also have to be cut down to every other week,\u201d he said.\nHe shouldn\u2019t have said that.\nThe League went into a state of panic, everyone was screaming, Hawkgirl was being held back by Martian Manhunter as she wildly swung her fists in every direction.\nIt was a mess.\nBut then Nightwing started laughing, a full-body laugh as he leaned in over the table.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, God, you guys are worse than Spoils with waffles,\u201d he said, wiping away a fake tear.\nHe was wearing a domino mask that covered his eyes, obviously, there wouldn\u2019t be an actual tear.\nBatman huffed, it almost sounded like a laugh.\nBut Batman doesn\u2019t laugh.\nBatman was capable of experiencing many emotions, angry, moody, broody, and justice\u2026y.\nLaughter wasn\u2019t in his range of expressions.\nThis got the whole League to be quiet and stare at the two of them.\n\u201cDid\u2026 did Batman just laugh?\u201d Flash heard Green Lantern whisper to Green Arrow.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s that serious, I know a great doughnut place in Bl\u00fcdhaven, I can swing by Friday if you guys want?\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou are such a clich\u00e9,\u201d Batman mumbled.\nWhat did that mean? Sure, friendliness and doing something just for the sake of pleasure were probably foreign concepts for Batman, but why would that make Nightwing a clich\u00e9?\nThe rest of the League didn\u2019t seem to hear Batman\u2019s comment as they exploded in praise, thanking the new member with many asking why they hadn\u2019t recruited him sooner.\nIt was bound to happen.\nHe should\u2019ve known.\nBut\u2026 well.\nSometimes Barry wished that things could be simple, that something good could happen and it would be just that, something good.\nBut life was cruel.\nHe sounded like Batman, had meeting his kids rubbed some of the magic from the adoption papers onto him? Maybe it was all that time spent in Gotham, doctors advise a maximum of 1 hour a month.\nHe had just Zeta\u2019d with Nightwing (who was still B01, for some reason they never got that changed, they did add his name to it though) when Oliver ran up to them.\n\u201cHey, Nigthwing! You\u2019re basically a Gothamite, right?\u201d he asked, bouncing on his feet.\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Nightwing and Barry looked at him suspiciously.\n\u201cGreat!\u201d and then he grabbed Nightwing, dragging him away to the interrogation room.\nBarry followed them, confused as to what was happening.\nWhen he got inside, he saw Wonder Woman and a man.\nNo.\nRed Hood.\nHe was bound to a chair, his helmet was still on, but his head was tilted back as though he was too weak to hold it up.\nHis head was turned towards the two-way mirror, but Barry guessed that his eyes were closed.\n\u201cWe found the Red Hood, he\u2019s an S-rank villain so we brought him back here,\u201d Diana explained, her arms were crossed, and she was glaring at the Red Hood.\n\u201cS-rank? Damn, what did I do to deserve that?\u201d he said, the voice filter distorting his laugh.\n\u201cDo: severed heads, ring any bell?\u201d Oliver said, tilting his head with a dangerous smile.\n\u201cHow did you even catch him? I didn\u2019t think anyone but Batman was allowed into Gotham,\u201d Nightwing said, you couldn\u2019t see the worry on him, he was trained to not have any tells.\nBut Barry knew.\nOf course, he knew.\nIf this had been any of his family members\u2026 he isn\u2019t sure what he would\u2019ve done.\n\u201cHe decided to visit Starling and we caught him,\u201d Oliver said, nodding his head at Diana who was still glaring at their captive.\nThe Red Hood had gone against Wonder Woman and Green Arrow.\nAnd he was still able to joke.\n\u201cYou did  What ?\u201d Nightwing said, his head snapping towards his brother, domino mask moving with his eyebrows as he glared at him.\n\u201cPlease Goldie, I don\u2019t need this right now.\u201d Hood groaned.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t-? Oh, maybe you should\u2019ve thought of that before you decided to step out of Gotham! Now I have to bust you out of here, how do you think that makes me feel?\u201d Nightwing said, gesturing wildly as he screamed at his brother.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to do  what ?\u201d Diana asked, shifting her glare towards Nightwing.\nOh no.\nThis wasn\u2019t good.\n\u201cSorry guys, but I\u2019m gonna have to take Hood back to Gotham with me,\u201d Nightwing said, moving to go and free him.\n\u201cMove a single muscle and I shoot,\u201d Oliver said, bow and arrow in hand as he aimed at Nightwing\u2019s stomach.\n\u201cLet\u2019s all calm down here-\u201c Barry tried to salvage the situation but was interrupted by Diana.\n\u201cI  trusted  you! I vouched for you, I was the one who suggested you!\u201d she screamed, the look of hurt in her eyes betraying her.\n\u201cSorry WW,\u201d he said, grimacing.\n\u201cAre you getting me out of here or what?\u201d Hood complained, cursing under his breath.\n\u201cKinda trying to  not  get shot here,\u201d Nightwing said, glaring at Red Hood.\n\u201cWell hurry up, I promised Red I\u2019d be done by now,\u201d\n\u201cYou did  what ?\u201d and at that moment the Zeta started.\n\u201cB04, B05, B06, B07, B08, B09,\u201d it called out.\n\u201cYou  know  he checks your tracker if you\u2019re even a minute late!\u201d Nightwing said.\nAnd then six people entered the room.\nRed Robin, Spoiler, Black Bat, Robin, Signal, and someone he didn\u2019t recognise.\nThe one he didn\u2019t recognise wore a black and blue suit with a mohawk.\n\u201cStep away from the idiot in the Red helmet,\u201d Red Robin said, holding up a stick in the most threatening way possible.\n\u201cWho are you guys?\u201d Oliver asked, glaring at them, but not lowering his bow.\n\u201cYour worst Nightmare,\u201d Spoiler said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that. We\u2019re trying to rescue a crime boss, let\u2019s at least try and salvage some of our reputation as good guys,\u201d Signal said, seemingly the only one with a braincell.\n\u201cAs if we need to prove ourselves to these morons,\u201d Robin said, scowling.\n\u201cYou guys aren\u2019t supposed to be up here,\u201d Nightwing said, glaring at his brothers.\n\u201cNeither is he,\u201d the new girl said, nodding her head towards Hood.\n\u201cI plead the fifth,\u201d Hood responded.\n\u201cWhere are the others?\u201d Nightwing asked, glaring at them.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me there will be another portal,\u201d Barry mumbled.\n\u201cThey\u2019re back at the cave with Penny One, Oracle hooked us up so they can hear everything.\u201d Spoiler pointed towards a corner of the room.\n\u201cLet Red Hood go and we won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d a female voice said, making Barry jump slightly.\n\u201cLike Hell we will! We\u2019ve already pinged the rest of the League, they\u2019ll be here in ten minutes,\u201d Oliver said.\n\u201cBatman here?\u201d Black Bat asked, they all seemed to freeze at that statement.\n\u201cThis is why I wanted us to hurry!\u201d Hood groaned.\n\u201cOkay, we tried to do this the easy way,\u201d the girl with the mohawk said, producing a gun the length of her arm out of nowhere, \u201cnow let\u2019s do this the hard way,\u201d\nSignal disappeared, and then Oliver\u2019s arrow was carefully taken off his bow. He didn\u2019t have time to comprehend that though, as the next thing he knew, a child was thrown at him, feet first.\nSpoiler and Black Bat lounged forward, their blows were blocked by Wonder Woman though, and they began a dance.\nThe girl Barry didn\u2019t know started shooting in seemingly random directions, but then Barry noticed how Red Robin had sneaked past them all and was untying Hood while Nightwing inserted himself in the fight against Wonder Woman.\n\u201cTo the Zeta!\u201d Red Robin called as soon as he was done, and all the bats dashed towards the Zeta.\n\u201cStop them!\u201d Wonder Woman screamed at Barry, a painful looking bruise already blossoming on her jaw from a particularly hard hit from Spoiler.\nFlash winced, knowing that feeling all too well.\nHe did run after them, not so much to stop them as it was to see more of what was going on.\nOliver was on the ground, groaning in pain as he struggled to stand up.\nFlash was the first to the Zeta, waiting on the bats with what he hoped was a \u201cdisappointed dad\u201d look.\nThey came running in, stopping right in front of him as Wonder Woman followed.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t see us!\u201d Spoiler pleaded with him.\n\u201c01, Batman,\u201d the Zeta called out.\nToo late.\n\u00a0\nBatman stepped off the platform, taking one look at all of his children and sighed.\n\u201cWhat are you doing up here?\u201d he asked, with all the patience of a father of 14.\nThey all started shouting, talking over each other, and making it impossible for anyone to understand what they were saying.\nBatman raised his hand, and they all went quiet. He pointed at Nightwing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all Hood\u2019s fault,\u201d he immediately said.\n\u201cThe fuck it is!\u201d Hood said, and they all began shouting again.\nUntil Batman raised his hand yet again, now pointing it at Red Robin.\n\u201cHood decided to visit Starling and got caught by Wonder Woman and Green Arrow, Nightwing tried to bust him out but he was then held by gun-point, err, I guess it\u2019s arrow-point.\u201d He looked around at his siblings, gaining nods as though they agreed with his judgement. \u201cAnd then I saw he was up here and I was like \u201cwell that can\u2019t be good\u201d and Bluebird was next to me, and she asked \u201cwhat can\u2019t be good?\u201d and so I showed her and she was like-\u201c\n\u201cGet to the point.\u201d Batman grunted.\n\u201cRight, well, we went up here to get him out, and it worked!\u201d Red Robin finished, all of his siblings nodding along with him.\n\u201cAnd the others?\u201d\n\u201cBack in the cave, they\u2019re listening in with Oracle,\u201d Spoiler said.\n\u201cHey B,\u201d multiple voices said at the same time.\nBatman sighed.\nAnd Barry saw a broken man. A man with too many children, who were all insanely talented at making his life difficult.\n\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d Green Arrow demanded.\nOh yeah.\nNot everyone here knew about them.\n\u201cThe Red Hood is Gotham\u2019s problem, we\u2019re taking him back,\u201d Batman said, like everything that happened didn\u2019t go way beyond \u201cI want  my  criminal in  my  city\u201d.\n\u201cAs soon as he stepped foot in Starling he became my problem,\u201d Green Arrow said, folding his arms while glaring at Batman.\nIt would\u2019ve worked better if he wasn\u2019t standing crooked due to the beating he had gotten from the Robin.\n\u201cWho are all of these people? They seem to fear you but you\u2019re speaking casually to each other. They have access to the Watchtower under the same classification as Nightwing,\u201d Wonder Woman said, running a hand through her hair as though she was stressed.\n\u201cB for bat,\u201d Black Bat said, crossing her arms over her chest.\n\u201cFear me?\u201d Batman said, sounding genuinely surprised like he didn\u2019t know how frightening he was.\n\u201cTt, we don\u2019t fear him,\u201d Robin said.\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t want to get grounded,\u201d Signal said, shivering.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t ground me! I have my own apartment, I go to work, I pay rent!\u201d Nightwing said, pointing at Batman.\n\u201cFor that argument to work you\u2019d have to actually be at your apartment,\u201d Batman responded dryly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Batman\u2019s son?\u201d Wonder Woman said, eyes wide.\n\u201cNightwing, Batman\u2019s lovechild with justice, at your service,\u201d Nightwing said, doing a theatrical bow before turning to Batman again.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t ground all of us!\u201d Nightwing shouted.\n\u201cNightwing is right, the manor wouldn\u2019t last the night if you grounded all of us,\u201d Red Hood said.\n\u201cRemember last time all sixteen of us were together?\u201d Spoiler said, and a collective shudder past through everyone in the room.\n\u201cSixteen? Three months ago it was fourteen!\u201d Flash said.\n\u201cLong story,\u201d they all responded at the same time.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d Oliver said, \u201cNo, no way  Batman  has  sixteen  children!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you insult my father you vermin!\u201d Robin said, being held back by Nightwing.\nThat didn\u2019t stop him from throwing a knife at him that flew just over his head.\n\u201cThat was a warning,\u201d he said, calming down in his brother\u2019s arms.\n\u201cHe\u2019s right, aren\u2019t we at seventeen?\u201d Red Robin said, counting on his fingers.\n\u201cI\u2019ve honestly lost count, are we still counting Jarro?\u201d Signal said, sounding distressed.\nA chorus of yes\u2019 and no\u2019s (the no\u2019s were mostly from Robin) were heard around the room\u2014the people at the cave also shouting.\n\u201cIs Batman even home?\u201d Nightwing asked, his question was followed by silence as all the siblings thought about it.\n\u201cBatman is right in front of you,\u201d Oliver, so very unhelpfully, supplied.\n\u201cWrong Batman,\u201d they all said.\nGod that was getting creepy.\n\u201cWait, Barry you knew?\u201d Oliver shouted, this seemed to also wake Wonder Woman out of her stupor as she looked at Barry.\n\u201cRan into a few of them, with their mother and aunts,\u201d Barry said, grinning shyly.\n\u201cYou met Harley?\u201d Bluebird said.\n\u201cAnd Ivy,\u201d Black Bat said.\n\u201cI should really get better at answering the bird call,\u201d she said, sounding disappointed that she hadn\u2019t been there.\n\u201cVery funny. He fainted,\u201d Black Bat sat, pointing at Barry.\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sorry, but a starfish popped out of a magical portal,\u201d Barry said.\nIn his defence, a lot had happened that hour, and the starfish was just the nail in the coffin.\n\u201cJarro? He couldn\u2019t hurt a fly,\u201d Bluebird said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s  Jarro?\u201d\n\u201cWe are getting off-topic. Batman, is the Red Hood your son?\u201d Wonder Woman asked, eyes wide and\u2026 hopeful?\n\u201cYes, he is my second oldest,\u201d\n\u201cThird and a half,\u201d all the kids said at the same time. Seriously, how do they do that?\n\u201cOracle isn\u2019t my child,\u201d he said with a sigh, sounding like he\u2019d had this discussion one too many times.\n\u201cSounds fake but okay,\u201d Spoiler said.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I have some grounding to do.\u201d And then he ushered all of his kids into the Zeta, before stepping himself.\nBarry went to go lie down, he was getting a headache."
