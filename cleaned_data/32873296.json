    "text": "\nThe year rings out, the second term ending and the third beginning with the rush of January, and Izuku Midoriya continues to work on his Quirk, slowly but surely coming to grips with his power, making it his own and gaining a sense of precision and understanding that would take most far more time. But Midoriya has had to do the same once before, already, has learned to grow exponentially compared to his peers thanks to One for All, and so the process is not quite as stressful as it could have been. It is a process that still continues, of course, his lessons with Aizawa not yet ceasing, but it is a skill that Midoriya has improved upon immensely.\n\n\nBut the story of today, of now, does not start with a feat of power or skill, is not a spectacle of chaos nor one of awe-inspiring acts.\u00a0\n\n\nNo, the story begins on a sunny but cold Monday afternoon just a few weeks into the third term, with Midoriya walking hand in hand with Eri, Aizawa on her other side, the three making their way through the city, searching for something to snack on, a treat for the young girl.\n\n\nAnd the story begins with Midoriya telling a story of his own, an explanation of the day that has passed.\u00a0\n\n\nCurrently, the boy is talking about a part that especially worries him, plaguing his mind. Not that something bad has happened, no. No, no one has been harmed, or upset in a way that is unsettling.\u00a0\n\n\nNo, it is just a stressful thing that happens in schools everywhere. A normal project, nothing more, nothing less, and yet Midoriya stresses over it in the same way that he has feared villains- perhaps moreso, considering that he is allowed to punch villains but not destroy the assignment he must complete.\n\n\nEven so, Midoriya takes the walk as a chance to explain his worries, going over them with Aizawa and Eri, who listen along attentively.\n\n\n\u201cBut Kayama-sensei says that our presentation has to be about something that is both informative and interesting,\u201d Midoriya says, his free hand reaching up to tug at a lock of hair, pulling it back only for it to spring back into place. \u201cAnd I was thinking about doing a lesson on analysis, but I don\u2019t really know how to make analyzing a hero... fun to watch, you know? I mean, it\u2019s usually just me scribbling down notes, and I don\u2019t usually show people those, and I know Nedzu finds them interesting but that\u2019s the finished result! I don\u2019t think that my friends would want to just...sit there as I write notes on heroes.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa hums, nods along, because he understands the concerns that his kid is fretting over. \u201cYou could always use one of your peers as an on the spot example, and then analyze them,\u201d Aizawa suggests. \u201cI\u2019m sure that one of your friends would volunteer for the role.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d make them excited!\u201d Eri agrees. \u201cThey could get picked by \n\nyou\n\n!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know a good damn lot of them would love \n\nthat\n\n,\u201d Aizawa mutters to himself, but neither Midoriya nor Eri hear him.\n\n\nInstead, Aizawa speaks up, voice louder so as to be heard, and says, \u201cYou could also increase their participation by asking them to help analyze the volunteer. It would make them more invested in the outcome.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut they might feel like it\u2019s an extra assignment for them,\u201d Midoriya counters. \u201cI don\u2019t want to push that onto them, especially once the more obvious traits are picked. If I ask for their input, I want to make it easy on them- they\u2019ll already be stressed over their own presentations, after all!\u201d\n\n\nAizawa blinks at Midoriya\u2019s worried expression, not surprised by the boy\u2019s unwillingness to even \n\npotentially\n\n place more stress on his friends. Really, he should have known.\n\n\n\"Then perhaps let them steer the discussion by choosing topics. Then they can have input, but they won't be supplying the answers.\"\n\n\nMidoriya hums, nods along. \"That would help...but I think I have a better idea?\"\n\n\nAnd Aizawa is always glad to see Midoriya have confidence in himself, so for the boy to hint that whatever he has in mind to be superior to Aizawa\u2019s?\n\n\nAizawa is more than happy to nod along, listening.\n\n\nAnd so Midoriya tells, lets his idea be known and Aizawa smiles, because it is an idea so truly in character for his Problem Child and Aizawa cannot \n\nwait\n\n to ask Nedzu for the security footage later that day.\n\n\nKami knows he will enjoy the results.\n\n\n\u201cSo you have your idea?\u201d Eri asks, when Midoriya is done explaining and Aizawa is left grinning like a madman.\n\n\n\u201cI think so, yeah!\u201d Midoriya says, and Eri cheers.\n\n\n\u201cGreat!\u201d A pause, and then, \u201cCan we go get mochi?\u201d\n\n\n(They get mochi.)\n\n\n(And, as it always does, the story continues.)\n\n\n-----\n\n\nThe story continues, Monday turning to Tuesday, and the class of 1-A is left stressing over the recently assigned project from Kayama.\n\n\nBut a statement such as that would imply an equally shared feeling of stress, would indicate that none of 1-A is prepared in any way, shape, or form. And this belief would be incorrect, because some do have ideas, even if their thoughts are not quite set in stone, not fully etched into their paths.\n\n\nStill, it is a beginning, and beginnings are beautiful things, important things that shape fate incredibly. And so these beginnings are treasured, especially compared to those who panic blindly, unsure of their future.\n\n\n(Let it not be said that the class of 1-A is not as dramatic as their supernova peer known best as Izuku Midoriya. For they surely are, even if in a different form of the meaning, a different approach to the matter.)\n\n\nThe students of 1-A sit around the classroom, perched at their desks, or clumped near those of their friends, as they wait for Yamada to enter the room and teach them English, and they speak as a group, the conversation following their school days.\n\n\nAnd so it is inevitable that the topic comes up, with Tooru Hagakure being the one to ask, \u201cHey, guys? What do you plan to talk about for Kayama-sensei\u2019s project? I\u2019m still stuck in the brainstorming process.\u201d\n\n\nAnd at first the students of 1-A pause, because they are unsure of who has plans and who does not, and who will want to share their ideas first. Most do not know, unfortunately, or perhaps have not yet bothered to decide, having put the process off for the evening.\n\n\nBut then Tsuyu Asui speaks, drawing attention to her like honey does flies, a comparison that does not suit the mind well when talking of a girl with a frog mutation.\n\n\n\u201cI want to teach you guys about something related to water rescues, \n\nkero\n\n.\u201d Tapping a finger to her cheek, Asui adds, \u201cAlthough I might switch to talking about frogs- there\u2019s a lot of frogs that you guys might find interesting.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Hagakure asks, and Asui hums.\n\n\n\u201cWell, some use color to turn invisible.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI want twenty,\u201d Hagakure says instantly, and the two laugh.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to be teaching you guys about memes!\u201d Denki Kaminari chimes in, then leans forwards on his desk to shoot Iida a fake glare. \u201cBecause \n\nsomeone\n\n would fail if he had to finish a vine reference on the spot!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKaminari!\u201d Tenya Iida says, face red as he adjusts his glasses. \u201cAre you sure that fits the criteria of being informative?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be informing \n\nyou\n\n, won\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI-\u201d Iida sputters, chops his arms. \u201cYou already have informed me! On the day that we swapped personalities, in fact, you gave me a quick course on the matter!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd yet I bet my \n\nother\n\n swap learned more memes on his own!\u201d Kaminari challenges. Iida freezes, then glances at Shouto Todoroki, who stares idly back.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI am sure that we are both equally informed in such a subject,\u201d Iida says, and Hitoshi Shinsou snorts.\n\n\n\u201cRight. Alright, finish this reference, then,\u201d Shinsou offers, and then, after a pause, simply says, \u201cJared.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe never learned how to read,\u201d Todoroki says somberly as Iida stares in confusion.\n\n\n\u201cThat was a reference?\u201d Iida asks, and then drops his head. \u201cI suppose the lecture will be informative, after all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to teach you guys about space!\u201d Ochako Uraraka chimes in, bright eyed at the very idea. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll just pull a page out of Deku\u2019s book and talk about Thirteen!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen maybe I should talk about Crimson Riot!\u201d Eijirou Kirishima realizes. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming up empty handed whenever I\u2019ve thought of it so far, this could work!\u201d Turning to Katsuki Bakugou, Kirishima asks, \u201cWhat do you plan to do, Bakubro?\u201d\n\n\nAnd Bakugou smirks, letting out a scoff and saying, \u201cI\u2019m teaching you idiots about explosions.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe already know about your Quirk,\u201d Shinsou says dryly, and Bakugou scowls at the boy.\n\n\n\u201cNo, you fucking insomniac! I\u2019m going to show you how to make your fucking own!\u201d Aiming a pointed look at Midoriya, Bakugou adds, \u201c\n\nWithout\n\n using my gauntlets- or my sweat in general.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShould I ask?\u201d Kaminari murmurs, and Midoriya laughs.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to test some stuff with his Quirk, and Kacchan has been my volunteer to work on my theories.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe volunteered?\u201d Uraraka asks.\n\n\n\u201cNo I didn\u2019t!\u201d Bakugou shouts, and then huffs, looking away. \u201cStupid nerd was going to try using \n\nhis\n\n Quirk to mimic mine, all based on some theories he came up with thanks to the \n\nrat\n\n. I wasn\u2019t going to risk watching him get hurt \n\nagain\n\n, then he\u2019s not good at sparring. I need a real fucking fight.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo compassionate,\u201d Kirishima murmurs.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re teaching us about how to make explosions? How are you getting that approved?\u201d Momo Yaoyorozu asks, her expression one of vague concern. \u201cSurely our teachers won\u2019t just let you use the necessary materials blindly, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey \n\ndid\n\n give Kacchan gauntlets that allow him to store his own sweat without any requirements,\u201d Midoriya points out helpfully, and Yaoyorozu blanches.\n\n\n\u201cAh, right.\u201d Clearing her throat, the vice representative asks, \u201cAre you taking any precautions of your own, Bakugou?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEighteen plus said I needed to work with a Support nerd to make sure I knew how to contain everything,\u201d Bakugou says, and then smiles widely, the look off putting and dangerous. \u201cSo I went to Deku\u2019s little friend- we\u2019re testing the different blast sizes today.\u201d\n\n\nAnd the students of 1-A do not know what is more frightening- the fact that Bakugou is teaming up with a girl like Mei Hatsume, who they have a much more distinct impression of ever since Midoriya impersonated the girl.\n\n\nOr the encouraging smile that Midoriya is giving Bakugou.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Midoriya chirps. \u201cHatsume has been a bit stressed lately, this will be a great way for her to let off some steam!\u201d\n\n\nPerhaps the answer is both. Especially with how the boys are grinning at one another.\n\n\nThinking it best to change the conversation, Shinsou turns to Midoriya and asks, \u201cSo, what do you plan to do?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, you know,\u201d Midoriya says vaguely. \u201cSomething fun!\u201d\n\n\nAnd the answer answers nothing at all for 1-A, the class knowing their peer as they do. And so his peers turn to him, hoping to get a better answer out of him.\n\n\nOnly for the bell to ring, Yamada stepping into the room.\n\n\nAnd so Tuesday comes and goes, and the story goes onwards all the more.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nAnd Wednesday speeds by, the day itself moving in the blink of an eye, and then the bell is ringing at the end of the day and the students of 1-A are preparing to head back to the dorms.\n\n\nAll except for one, for Izuku Midoriya, who packs his bag and listens to his peers as they speak, knowing that he will be going a separate route the moment that they exit the room.\n\n\nIt \n\nis\n\n Wednesday, after all, a day meant to be spent with a specific principal.\n\n\n(Chants of \u2018rat god Wednesday\u2019 still ring through the halls, even now. It is as ominous as it is enthralling, a delight to be had that leaves shivers down one\u2019s spine.)\n\n\nBut for the moment, Izuku is not in a rush, knowing that Nedzu does not begin to make their tea until a few minutes after the bell has rung, so that their drinks are perfectly heated when Izuku walks into the room. It is just a thing that Nedzu does, a control habit, he believes. Just another aspect in life that Nedzu can alter at his own whims, but chooses to keep repetitive for the sake of repetition itself.\n\n\nIt\u2019s familiar, though, and Izuku cannot blame the principal. Nedzu\u2019s little quirks are as fascinating as his actual Quirk, even if interesting in a different way.\u00a0\n\n\nBut all that matters at the current moment is that Izuku is in no hurry, and so Izuku smiles and laughs along with his friends as they try to discuss their thoughts.\u00a0\n\n\nCurrently, they seem to be set on shaming Iida for his project idea.\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do your presentation on the school rules, Iida!\u201d Uraraka exclaims, though the way that she can\u2019t look Iida in the eye is a sure sign that the brunette is about to laugh.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt will be informative!\u201d Iida says. \u201cEspecially to Kaminari, who does not seem to know the rules!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really a roast if they\u2019re not there to hear it,\u201d Shinsou murmurs. \u201cAnd to think, you were so close.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlthough your topic would be informative,\u201d Asui starts, \u201cit likely wouldn\u2019t be entertaining, \n\nkero\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nIida\u2019s jaw drops, and then he clicks it shut. Arm chopping, the boy says, confused, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound offensive, and my apologies if I do...but isn\u2019t Shinsou\u2019s plan to talk about sleep? And not even the benefits of sleep, but just- \n\nsleep\n\n?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt will be entertaining,\u201d Shinsou says, smiling wryly, but Iida just shakes his head.\n\n\n\u201cAnd why do you all believe my topic to be so bad, when we all surely know that Todoroki is just going to talk about M-\u201d\n\n\nIzuku watches as Todoroki lights up suddenly, hair setting on fire and hand reaching out. Iida quiets immediately.\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t talk about that,\u201d Todoroki says calmly. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\n\nIzuku blinks, then smiles. Perhaps Todoroki wants to talk about his mom? How sweet!\n\n\n\u201cHave you figured out your project?\u201d Uraraka asks Izuku, and Izuku nods.\n\n\n\u201cYeah! I\u2019m almost done with it, actually!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Uraraka cheers, and Izuku beams.\n\n\n\u201cIt is!\u201d A quick glance at the clock tells Izuku that it\u2019s probably time to go, so he shoulders his backpack and waves to his friends. \u201cI\u2019ll see you guys at the dorms!\u201d\n\n\nHis friends quickly say their farewells, and Izuku exits the classroom for 1-A, then treks down to the principal\u2019s office. The halls are already fairly empty, most students having left the moment that the bell rang, eager to head back to their dorms. This just means that the path is clear, and that Izuku is able to reach Nedzu\u2019s office in a shorter period of time than he otherwise would have.\n\n\nIzuku lifts his hand to knock on the door, and a cheerful \u201cCome in!\u201d reaches his ears a moment before his hand can meet wood, just as it always does.\n\n\nAnd so Izuku enters Nedzu\u2019s office, the creature smiling at him as he does so.\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya! Good afternoon!\u201d Nedzu greets, and Izuku smiles back.\n\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, Nedzu!\u201d The principal wouldn\u2019t accept being called sensei, for whatever reason, and Izuku had grown used to the wish of his mentor. (This one of multiple, at the very least.)\n\n\nNedzu waits until Izuku has sat down to push his cup of tea his way, and Izuku takes it, hands wrapping instinctively around the mug.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd just like that, they\u2019ve begun.\u00a0\n\n\n(And so the two will talk of many things, of those both pointless and those that mean far too much in the world. And although the world may wish to hear of such things, it is best left unspoken, unheard of. All of Yuuei knows this, even if not consciously, a reason that Nedzu\u2019s office and the area surrounding it remains vacant for all but two, not even the teachers daring to go near the door when in need of answers.\n\n\nBut the two will talk, both as mentor and protege, but also as equals, two minds coming together to tear things apart and remake them.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd one thing that they will talk of is Izuku\u2019s growth, of how he has progressed with his Quirks since the beginning of the year, since he awakened his birth Quirk.\n\n\nAnd although Izuku will not know it, will not be told it, not yet, Nedzu is proud of the boy\u2019s growth.\n\n\nBecause the boy is growing, despite it all, and that is more than enough for the principal.\n\n\nThings are changing, but Izuku is not alone, and that is a constant that will remain forevermore.)\n\n\n-----\n\n\nThursday begins calmly.\n\n\nEmphasis on \n\nbegins\n\n.\n\n\nIt does not stay this way, not for long. Not when the students of 1-A see Midoriya enter the room, and see that the outfit he wears is not the school\u2019s uniform, but something else entirely.\n\n\nGone are the red shoes, replaced with normal black dress shoes. And the Yuuei uniform is replaced by a light gray suit with a white dress shirt underneath, a red tie with white dots tied perfectly as the final touch, clothing wise at least.\n\n\nAccessory wise, Midoriya only adds one new item, a pair of glasses that seem to turn opaque in the right lighting, giving him an intimidating look.\n\n\nAnd Midoriya seems to have made use of the makeup case given to him on Christmas, his hair no longer its normal curly dark green, but rather straightened, parted, and given three yellow streaks.\n\n\nWith a stiff gait and hands clasped behind his back, Midoriya is a man that most do not recognize.\n\n\nBut one that enough do. Those who participated in the raid against the Shie Hassaikai, who saw the man who was foolish enough that Midoriya rejected his internship offer to go elsewhere, the same man who was also sensible enough to apologize and make amends with their shining center, the sunshine of 1-A.\n\n\nThey are the ones that recognize Midoriya to be Sir Nighteye, the only former sidekick of All Might.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a sign of things to come, in more ways than one.\n\n\nHomeroom goes well enough, although Aizawa seems to be surprised by Midoriya\u2019s apparel upon first glance. It\u2019s a surprising fact, at first, given the conservative nature of Midoriya\u2019s outfit, but giving the matter a second thought, it makes sense. Midoriya had gone to his lessons with Nedzu the day before, after all, and so Nedzu could have easily given the assignment during their allotted time. Along with this, those who went on the raid or have been told of the hero are quick to offer information to those left in the dark, explaining how Sir Nighteye had brushed Midoriya aside at first, having only seen him for his lack of control during the Sports Festival. It was a mistake Nighteye had fixed, luckily, apologizing after the raid for his assumptions, but the mistake was enough that most of 1-A doubted the man would have been considered as an assignment in Aizawa\u2019s mind.\u00a0\n\n\nSo of course Aizawa would not be aware- he would not have suggested such a character, after all.\n\n\nBut Midoriya\u2019s meeting with Nedzu had led to this, and so Aizawa blinks only once before nodding along, surely trusting his favored student, the boy who was practically his son, in knowing his own boundaries in terms of comfort.\n\n\nAnd so homeroom went by, with nothing going wrong.\n\n\nQuite honestly, nothing truly goes \n\nwrong\n\n on this Thursday. Midoriya\u2019s character is a rather tame one, and it is not one chosen to torment anyone in specific. There is no hidden maliciousness or need for chaos, only a want for more practice, a chance for Midoriya to act and grow used to his Quirk.\n\n\nIt is more of a test for Midoriya, a test of endurance.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd so the morning goes smoothly, none of the teachers having problems with Midoriya. Midoriya is the picture definition of polite, after all, if a little quiet. If he were in a different ensemble, perhaps he could have been considered a quiet version of Iida, with diligent notes and sharp movements, but he is not in a different outfit and so it is clear that he is someone else entirely.\u00a0\n\n\nNot even Hizashi Yamada reacts poorly, the man instead offering a small smile at the sight of Midoriya in character. Because despite the many scares that Yamada has had, he is glad to see the boy growing more confident, stepping back into the spotlight and embracing the changes as a part of himself. Midoriya is moving back into the narrative, letting his acts resume, and Yamada cannot fault anyone for such a thing, cannot be upset in the slightest.\u00a0\n\n\n(Because Yamada is a teacher, a good one, just like the rest of the teachers of Yuuei. And just like the others, he is happy when he sees one of his students flourishing.\n\n\nAnd though this is not the type of teacher that Midoriya is used to, it is the type he has now, a type that he will have all throughout Yuuei. It is the type he deserves, and the type he gets.\n\n\nAnd they will be there for him through it all.)\n\n\nNo, there are no issues with the teachers, but the day is not completely calm.\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s all because of one key moment, one that the students of 1-A will look back on and laugh over.\n\n\nAll except for one, to be more precise.\n\n\nThe incident occurs right after the bell rings for lunch, with Denki Kaminari jumping up and racing over to the professionally dressed boy. Kaminari is all but vibrating as he leans in close, his face mere inches away from Midoriya\u2019s as he asks, \u201cHey, your Quirk lets you see the future, right? That\u2019s what Kirishima told me. Can you use your Quirk on me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy Quirk only works for one hour, and then it will need twenty-four hours to be usable once more,\u201d Midoriya explains, voice bordering on cold and definitely uninterested. One eyebrow raising ever so slightly, he asks, \u201cIs your curiosity worth it? Are your inquiries so desperate to be filled?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Kaminari says, nodding rapidly. \u201cDude, it\u2019s my \n\nfuture\n\n! Will I look hot as an adult- ooh, does my costume ever change? How soon do I go out with someone, and who is it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it works like that,\u201d Kirishima admits hesitantly. \u201cI thought he could only see the actions of the person he touched...not who else is with them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, bummer!\u201d Kaminari pouts, then smiles again, looking at Midoriya and asking, \u201cSo, will you do it?\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya sighs, and then stands. Fingers drumming on the table slowly, he says, \u201cI suppose I can play along, just this once. I do not have any pressing cases that require my Quirk at the moment, only my brain. Very well. Give me your hand.\u201d\n\n\nKaminari juts out his hand, and Midoriya gives him a look of exasperation, sighing once again.\n\n\nThen Midoriya takes the hand presented to him, and his eyes glow purple, clocklike designs appearing within. Midoriya hums, tilting his head, eyes almost distant as they perceive the person before him.\n\n\n\u201cYou will die in seven days,\u201d Midoriya says, voice eerie and dry, and Kaminari lets go with a yelp.\n\n\n\u201cWhat the \n\nfuck\n\n!\u201d Kaminari screams, and Midoriya lets out a chuckle.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a joke,\u201d Midoriya says plainly. \u201cGood luck on your next sparring match, Kaminari.\u201d\n\n\nNeedless to say, Kaminari moves cautiously for the next week.\n\n\nThe rest of the day goes rather smoothly, all things considered, or perhaps even without considering the variables of the present. Lunch goes well, with Midoriya eating calmly beside Toshinori Yagi, who cannot refrain from taking photos and sending them to the man being impersonated- a fact that will lead to a stoic man smiling, another hint of a bridge being rebuilt with time and dedication- as he marvels at his successor. And this chance to see Midoriya before class gives Yagi the ability to teach heroics without faltering, nothing going amiss, not with Midoriya having already used Mirai Sasaki\u2019s Quirk on Kaminari, no longer usable after the hour had passed.\n\n\nAnd so the day ends not with a bang, but with a calm finale, the bell ringing and allowing Midoriya to seamlessly transition back into himself, a smiling ray of joy incarnate as he looks upon his peers.\n\n\n\u201cI made it through the day,\u201d Midoriya says, eyes sparkling with the realization, and his joy is infectious for the rest of 1-A.\n\n\nAll in all, it is a good day.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nAnd a great Thursday turns into a wonderful Friday, with the students of 1-A bouncing from either anticipation or excitement as they reach Nemuri Kayama\u2019s class.\n\n\nNot that Nemuri could ever judge her students. Not when she, too, has been looking forward to seeing what they will bring to the table, so to speak.\n\n\nProject presentations begin the moment that Nemuri steps into the room, and if one were to ask her later on, she'd say that she's proud of her students for meeting her expectations- and, for some, even surpassing them.\u00a0\n\n\nShinsou\u2019s presentation, for one, easily earns quite a few laughs out of her, the boy rating Yuuei's different spaces by how often Shouta Aizawa fell asleep there- with pictures to reference, of course- before hopping into a more legitimate speech on the problems that come with sleep deprivation as proof on why Shouta shouldn't be interrupted during his naps.\n\n\n\"Just look at the difference,\" Shinsou finishes, clicking to a slide with four pictures. The first side has a picture of Shouta sleeping, but it's crossed out, and an arrow points to an angry, red-eyed Shouta as the next image, a direct correlation of sleeplessness and rage. The third image is one that makes 1-A coo, a picture of Shouta and Midoriya in matching sleeping bags, fast asleep, and an arrow leads to a picture of a slightly smiling Shouta. \"In conclusion, let Aizawa sleep, but especially in the classroom and teacher's lounge, because I'm pretty sure he expelled a kid once for tripping over him in the hallway.\"\n\n\nYes, Shinsou\u2019s presentation instantly takes a spot as one of Nemuri\u2019s favorites, due to its ability to humor her, but there are two others that are especially notable to the R-rated hero.\n\n\nThe next has to be Todoroki\u2019s, due to the boy\u2019s lack of nerves as he once again makes it clear to his peers where his affections lay.\n\n\n\"My project is on the most important people in my life, and why they deserve the title,\" Todoroki explains upon his project appearing onto the screen, and promptly jumps into a slideshow covered in pictures.\n\n\nAnd oh, how Nemuri wants to squeal in delight, seeing who Todoroki shows upon the screen. Because at first it is the boy's mother, and Todoroki praises her with love clearly in his heart. And then Todoroki moves on, showing a few slides with his siblings upon it and speaking of their influence on him.\n\n\nBut then the boy switches to a picture of Midoriya, and something shifts. And Nemuri would have to be blind, or as oblivious as Midoriya appears to be when it comes to matters of the heart, to miss the way that Todoroki softens, words filled with admiration and adoration as he spends more than half of his time simply talking about his peer, waxing poetry about the boy's greatest traits.\n\n\nAnd although Midoriya may miss the connection, may not realize that Todoroki has only spoken about people who he loves, Nemuri can see how red faced and teary eyed the boy has become, a sign that Todoroki\u2019s words have flustered him. And that's a start, Nemuri supposes.\n\n\nAnd then comes the third project that comes to mind the most. Midoriya\u2019s project, being presented right after Todoroki\u2019s near confession of a speech.\n\n\nMidoriya, Nemuri has always known, is a bright mind wrapped in a kind soul. She's scored his papers, his analyses of art that she's shown the class. Understanding and learning come quickly to him, and it's of no surprise to Nemuri that the boy knows a \n\nlot\n\n.\n\n\nBut Midoriya has always been rather timid, when forced into the spotlight. Speeches made him shake, and presentations made him panic.\n\n\nOr, rather, they used to. But then the spotlight became something else to Midoriya, something better. Acting under Aizawa\u2019s assignments helped the boy flourish, helped him embrace the confidence lurking within.\n\n\nAnd so when Midoriya's turn comes up, he does not even hesitate to begin, and it is this confidence that sticks in Nemuri\u2019s head, this clear sign of growth.\n\n\n\u201cI was going to teach you guys about analysis,\" Midoriya starts, voice nonchalant yet excited, \"but that didn\u2019t sound very fun- not for you guys, at least. However, I am rather good at a skill that relies heavily on talent and analysis, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be talking about today!\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya clicks on a remote- one that Nemuri doesn't remember him grabbing, now that she thinks about it- and a slideshow pops up.\n\n\n\"Let's talk about acting!\" Midoriya chirps, and so they do exactly that.\n\n\nAnd Midoriya takes the stage, so to speak, starting off strong by explaining all of the ways one can act, its uses and types and even its origins. And this is all well and good, this is the informative speech Nemuri asked for, but it is also only the start.\n\n\nBecause then Midoriya applies it to himself.\n\n\n\"Now, if I were to fit myself into one of these definitions, which one would you guys apply to me?\" And Midoriya gestures to the slide, definitions covering the page, and smiles invitingly at his peers.\n\n\nAnd Kirishima responds, shouting out, \"You're a method actor, right?\"\n\n\nMidoriya beams, then knocks his fists together, the limbs hardening right as they collide. \"You got it!\" Midoriya cheers, and the sudden Quirk usage is enough to get 1-A perked up, drawn right into Midoriya\u2019s presentation, an attentive audience for their actor.\n\n\nMidoriya drops the Quirk, the persona, and flashes a blinding smile. \"The best definition \n\nwould\n\n be method actor, considering how I don't break character when given assignments, and that my Quirk can only work if I'm portraying someone else.\"\u00a0\n\n\nChanging slides, Midoriya asks, \"I've given you guys a lot of information on the benefits of acting. Which ones can be applied to heroics?\"\n\n\nAnd the students of 1-A heed his call, hands raising and answers on the tips of their tongues, much to Nemuri\u2019s delight. Because participation is voluntary, their interactions with the projects of their peers have no influence on their grades, and yet over half of the class is eager to get involved.\n\n\nAnd Midoriya rewards this decision, acting as whichever peer offers an answer, using his Quirk to mimic theirs.\n\n\n\"Acting could help you infiltrate an area,\" Uraraka says, and Midoriya nods, hands closing around the remote before opening up.\n\n\n\"Exactly!\" Midoriya says, ignoring the way that the remote floats upwards, untethered by gravity. \"Being a good actor would allow you to sneak into places otherwise untouchable!\" Midoriya glances upwards, then flushes. \"Oh, my bad!\" Fingers press together, and a cry of \"Release!\" is enough for the remote to drop back into Midoriya\u2019s hand, the persona dropping away the moment plastic meets skin.\n\n\n\"Right, who's next?\"\n\n\nAnd Nemuri could keep going, truly, could keep describing how Midoriya proceeds to mimic a third of his class, praising them in their own character before using their Quirks to heighten their excitement, but, really, there's only one more that Nemuri feels the urge to note.\n\n\n\"Being able to act would allow you to have a persona, so that you can make yourself and others feel comfortable,\" Todoroki offers, and Midoriya blinks before smiling ever so softly, a grin that's barely there but genuine, a Todoroki grin.\n\n\n\"Perfectly said,\" Midoriya responds, ice forming in one hand, frosting over the remote.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd then Midoriya pauses, eyes catching on his own desk and staying there.\n\n\nAnd then Midoriya is snapping out of it, persona dropping and smile growing. And he finishes up his presentation, wrapping it up and thanking his peers for their involvement.\n\n\nFace growing oddly red all the while.\n\n\nBut Nemuri does not ask, does not press, because she has a feeling that she knows perfectly well what has just happened, what has been realized. And Midoriya seems perplexed by this information, stunned by the new comprehension of the world that he has...but not upset.\n\n\nNot upset in the slightest.\n\n\nAnd so Nemuri Kayama lets her class finish in peace, and then offers the rest of the class as a free period, reveling in the way that Todoroki and Midoriya instantly begin to speak with one another.\n\n\nNeither will make a move, she knows, Todoroki too scared by Aizawa and Midoriya too new to this knowledge, but that is quite alright.\n\n\nNemuri has always been a fan of slow burns, after all.\n\n\n(And so the week ends on a high note, full of joy.\n\n\nAnd perhaps the start of something more, but only time will tell that tale.)\n"
