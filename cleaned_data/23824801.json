    "text": "If Hawks had his way, Dabi would never have found out about his son. No one would. He would remain Hawks\u2019s to have and protect and dote on the way that he never was. Toma would never be vulnerable because Hawks wouldn\u2019t allow it. He would grow up like a normal kid with a speed quirk and a pair of bright red wings on his back, going to school with friends and unbothered by the enemies his father has made throughout his career.\nNumber two hero or not, Hawks walks a fine line. Playing devil\u2019s advocate with the League and the Commission is a dangerous game and the bloody arrival of his son one afternoon on the floor of his bathroom only ups the stakes impossibly higher. \nBefore Toma, he\u2019d never even been certain that he wanted children, but once he has him, he\u2019s never wanted anything more. Toma has wide, amber eyes with black markings at the corners, and soft, fuzzy blonde hair, and sharp little talons on both his hands and feet. He\u2019s perfect and Hawks knows instantly that he will do whatever he has to in order to keep him safe.\nHe makes it a full two months before Dabi finds out. \nIt\u2019s easily his worst memory in recent history, to be pacing the living room of his loft in the middle of the night, trying to sooth his crying baby back to sleep, and to hear the balcony door open only for Dabi to step through. Hawks has never felt fear like it before in his entire life. No battle, no mission, no meeting with Dabi has ever filled him with such a full-bodied sense of dread before. \nThey stare at one another, Toma wailing in his ear, and Hawks\u2019s feathers quivering behind him, ready to detach, if he needs them. He waits for Dabi to make the first move, completely uncertain if it\u2019s wise or not to do so.\nFinally, Dabi pulls the door shut behind him and heaves an annoyed breath.\n\u201cSudden possession of a child is not a good enough excuse to ignore my texts,\u201d he says, pacing closer.\nHawks tightens his grip on his son. \u201cStop,\u201d he orders, calling one of his feathers to his other hand, holding it out in front of him. \nDabi continues moving until the sharpened tip of it digs into his chest. He stops there, tucking his hands into the pockets of his impossibly tight jeans and tipping his head slightly. \u201cIs that yours?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Hawks asks. Toma has wings, for fuck\u2019s sake.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a Lady Hawks.\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t,\u201d Hawks bites out, prodding Dabi harder with the point of his feather. \u201cJust forget what you saw and leave.\u201d\nDabi shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna do that. Besides, you look like you could use a break. Your eye bags are worse than mine.\u201d Hawks almost laughs at that. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d\nHawks hesitates. \u201cToma.\u201d\n\u201cLet me hold him.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m good with kids.\u201d\nHawks snorts. \u201cSomehow I doubt that.\u201d\nDabi holds out his hands and Toma keeps crying. \u201cNever know unless you hand him over.\u201d\nHawks\u2019s hand shakes around his feather. Only a select group of people even know that Toma exists. The Commission doesn\u2019t, the League doesn\u2019t, he has no family to speak of\u2014besides Toma himself\u2014and there certainly isn\u2019t another parent in the picture. Hawks is flying completely blind on this, relying mostly on instinct and YouTube videos on how-to parenting. \nHe\u2019s exhausted and he\u2019s tired of going it alone. And, despite everything, he thinks he might actually kind of trust Dabi. Stupid as that may be.\nSlowly, he lowers his feather and Dabi steps forward again. They maintain eye contact as Dabi takes Toma from him, careful to support his head as he holds up his squirming body to look at him. \n\u201cHe\u2019s like a little clone of you,\u201d he comments before tucking the baby in against his chest. \nHawks watches with rapt, tired eyes as Dabi rubs gently at the small of his back, just under the base of his wings. Dabi\u2019s fingers look massive against Toma\u2019s tiny body and Hawks\u2019s vision starts to blur. He rubs at his eyes, releasing his feather to return to its place in his left wing. \nAfter a few moments, Toma\u2019s cries begin to fade to whimpers, and then eventually to nothing as he falls silent, eyelids drooping, his head pillowed against Dabi\u2019s scarred chest.\n\u201cHow in the hell\u2026\u201d\nDabi takes hold of his wrist and guides his palm to rest against his collarbone. He\u2019s warm, far warmer than a human, or even Hawks runs.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he whispers, his hand lingering a moment even after Dabi releases him.\n\u201cGotta bake him, a little.\u201d\n\u201cIncubate,\u201d Hawks says with a snort.\nDabi shrugs. \u201cSame difference.\u201d\nHawks scrubs at his face with both hands. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Dabi?\u201d\n\u201cI came to see why you\u2019ve been playing so hard to get, lately. Shigaraki\u2019s getting annoyed.\u201d \nToma is now fully asleep in Dabi\u2019s arms and Hawks takes a moment to wonder what the fuck his life is becoming.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d\nDabi lifts his brows. \u201cI\u2019ll say. Where\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\u201cMe.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019d you shit out a kid?\u201d\nHawks gives him the flattest look he\u2019s capable of. Dabi grins at him in return, his jack-o-lantern smile visible over Toma\u2019s soft, blonde curls. \n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know.\u201d\n\u201cObviously. We could have some pretty babies together, birdie.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d hit you if you weren\u2019t holding my child.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely terrified.\u201d\nHawks folds his arms against his chest, tucking his wings in tighter to his back. \u201cAre you gonna stay?\u201d \n\u201cWe makin\u2019 that baby, tonight?\u201d\n\u201cFuck off. I don\u2019t want him to start whining again the second you put him down.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to invent excuses to get me to stay the night, Hawks.\u201d\n\u201cI hate you.\u201d\n\u201cFeeling\u2019s mutual,\u201d Dabi says as he turns to go sit down on the couch. \nToma doesn\u2019t do more than snuffle and curl his little body up further into Dabi\u2019s warmth. He certainly doesn\u2019t look put out, sitting on Hawks\u2019s couch, holding his infant son. He looks almost content, drawing nonsense patterns with his fingers over the back of the pajamas that Hawks had to alter to fit Toma\u2019s wings.\nHawks falls asleep beside them, his legs tucked up under him and his head resting on his arm against the back of the couch. He wakes up with a stiff neck and a cramp in one of his wings, but Toma sleeps through the night and Dabi holds him in the morning while Hawks makes them breakfast. \nOverall, it isn\u2019t the worst night of his life.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nToma is eight months old when things begin to pivot between Hawks and Dabi again.\nD: meeting. midnight.\n\nCan\u2019t make it\n\nD: why\n\nToma\u2019s sick.\n\nD: bird flu?\n\nNot funny.\n\nHawks locks his phone and tosses it to the far end of the couch. Slumping down until the base of his wings hit the back of the couch; he stretches his aching legs out and then lets them relax, closing his eyes. The loft is silent for all of three minutes before Toma begins to shift restlessly against his chest again, a soft, weak whine bubbling up pathetically in his throat. Hawks rubs circles on his back, just under his wings, shushing him quietly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay, baby,\u201d he whispers.\nToma rubs his face into Hawks\u2019s chest, his little forehead burning through the fabric of his shirt. He doesn\u2019t settle, whining and squirming around, clearly uncomfortable. Hawks strokes his sweaty hair and murmurs to him, soft little whispers that soothe him slowly until he lulls into an uneasy silence that Hawks just knows isn\u2019t going to last long.\nStill, he closes his burning eyes and tries to rest while he can. He hasn\u2019t slept in over twenty-four hours, at this point, and he\u2019s flagging steadily toward falling asleep whether Toma is awake or not.\nHawks startles when he feels Toma being lifted off of his chest. At first Hawks thinks he\u2019s dropping him, jerking upright out of his slump. Dabi is standing over him, turning a whining Toma around to hold him against his own chest.\nHawks\u2019s heart pounds in his throat as he blows out a breath, rubbing his bleary eyes with both hands.\n\u201cShit, Dabi,\u201d he rasps. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\nDabi ignores him, putting the backs of his fingers against Toma\u2019s forehead for a moment as he whines, his sharp, little toes snagging on the thin fabric of Dabi\u2019s shirt. Dabi, to his credit, doesn\u2019t so much as wince as Toma\u2019s talons dig into his stomach. \n\u201cBurnin\u2019 up, little sparrow?\u201d he asks, voice soft in the way that it only ever is when it\u2019s directed at Toma.\nToma\u2019s forehead thumps down on his shoulder and he yanks at a fistful of Dabi\u2019s shirt, letting out a soft whimper. Dabi rubs gently at the base of one of his wings, scratching at the downy feathers there as he looks down at Hawks.\n\u201cYou look like shit.\u201d\nHawks snorts, raking a hand through his hair, fingers catching on a particularly stubborn knot.\n\u201cThanks.\u201d \n\u201cWhen can he have something for the fever, again?\u201d\nHawks reaches for his phone, groaning when his stiff back protests the stretch. \u201cTwenty minutes, give or take.\u201d\nDabi grunts his acknowledgment, looking down at Toma who has his chubby, flushed cheek resting on Dabi\u2019s collarbone. \n\u201cSet an alarm, I\u2019ve got him \u2018til then.\u201d\nHawks doesn\u2019t know exactly when he started trusting Dabi with his son, but Toma likes him and Hawks is too fucking tired to protest. He is in desperate need of a power nap. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, with a nod of his head. He\u2019s not going to think too much about it, right now.\nDabi walks away without another word, patting Toma on the back as he goes. Hawks sets an alarm on his phone for exactly twenty minutes, and slumps over onto his stomach, pillowing his head on his arms. He drifts off quickly, listening to Dabi\u2019s booted footsteps pacing up and down the hallway.\nThe sharp ringing of his phone seems to come mere moments later, jolting him awake with momentary panic that he doesn\u2019t know where Toma is before he remembers that Dabi has him. Hawks sits up with a groan, not giving himself time to contemplate five more minutes, before he pads barefoot into the kitchen for the bottle of liquid medicine beside the sink.\nHe takes a minute to make himself a cup of black tea before he follows the light at the end of the hallway to his bedroom.\nThe bathroom door is cracked and the light is on. He elbows it open all the way, pausing in the doorway. The sight of Dabi on his knees beside the bathtub and Toma splashing his fat, little hands in the water isn\u2019t one that he\u2019s going to forget anytime soon. \nToma looks at him and coos a decidedly birdlike sound at him which Hawks returns. Dabi looks up at him with an arched eyebrow.\nHawks says nothing to him, moving to sit on the counter and taking a sip of his steaming tea. Toma\u2019s face is decidedly less flushed than it was before; he certainly looks happier than he did earlier, even though his hair is wet and plastered to his head. He hates getting his hair washed. Hawks has no idea how Dabi did it without Toma screaming bloody murder.\nThe baby coos at him again.\n\u201cIs he actually saying anything to you?\u2019\nHawks hums over the rim of his mug. \u201cNot really. There\u2019s no like, direct translation. He\u2019s just happy to see me.\u201d\nDabi makes a noise, flicking water at Toma with his index finger. Toma smacks the water with both hands, splashing Dabi\u2019s shirt and the floor at the same time. Hawks hides his grin behind his mug. \n\u201cHis fever\u2019s down,\u201d Dabi says, handing Toma the washcloth he\u2019s holding. The baby immediately sticks it into his mouth, sucking the water from the saturated fabric. \u201cTry a lukewarm bath, next time.\u201d\nToma offers Dabi the washcloth and Dabi leans in and bites it with his skeleton grin. Toma coos at him in his soft, trilling voice, his eyes squinting as he smiles.\nThere\u2019s a sharp, painfully familiar ache in Hawks\u2019s chest as he watches the two of them. He flexes his toes, talons curling under his feet as he does. \n\u201cDo you have kids?\u201d Hawks asks suddenly.\nDabi snorts, smoothing a hand over Toma\u2019s wet hair. \u201cDo I look like the daddy type?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Dabi shoots him a narrow-eyed look over his shoulder. Hawks holds up his free hand. \u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who said the D word.\u201d Dabi turns his attention back to Toma who is currently enamored with one of the staples on his wrist. \u201cToma,\u201d Hawks says sharply, drawing his son\u2019s gaze, \u201cno.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cThose talons might not feel like much, but I\u2019m telling you, they\u2019re like little razorblades.\u201d\nDabi shrugs a shoulder, letting Toma continue picking at him. \u201cI\u2019ve had worse.\u201d If he was close enough, Hawks would kick him.\n\u201cSo, you take care of a lot of sick babies, or what?\u201d Hawks presses.\n\u201cGoddamn, Hawks, just shut up and enjoy the silence.\u201d\nKnowing that it\u2019s pretty unlikely that Dabi is going to expand on or explain anything, Hawks just sips his tea until Dabi stands up, both of his knees crunching like gravel in the process. He doesn\u2019t comment on it, so Hawks says nothing, setting his mug aside and sliding off of the counter to grab Toma\u2019s towel from the hook on the back of the door.\nDabi picks him up, out of the water, and holds him out, dripping all over the floor, while Hawks wraps him up. His towel has a slit in the back for each wing and a little hood that Hawks pulls up over his damp head while Dabi pulls his wings through. The front of his white shirt is nearly transparent for how wet it is. Hawks huffs a breath through his nose, pressing his lips to Toma\u2019s forehead; his skin is much cooler now.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get you a different shirt after I get him changed.\u201d\nDabi makes another non-verbal response and leans over to drain the water from the tub. \nToma is decidedly less fussy as Hawks dresses him in a light onesie and wraps one of his thinner receiving blankets around him. He yawns widely, burrowing in against Hawks\u2019s chest as soon as he\u2019s picked up again. Hawks hopes they\u2019ll both finally be able to sleep. \nDabi is shirtless, pawing through his dresser, when Hawks steps back into his bedroom. He pauses just inside the doorway, watching him for a moment. He\u2019s never seen Dabi without a shirt before, and has never seen the extent of his scarring, either. It\u2019s not as bad as he\u2019d imagined, stopping just above his shoulder blades but continuing around his right side in an oblong patch that doesn\u2019t connect to anything else.\nFinally, Dabi seems to find something that he doesn\u2019t mind wearing, and pulls a plain, gray shirt over his head. It\u2019s got to be one of the only tops that Hawks owns that hasn\u2019t been altered to fit his wings.\nDabi turns, his damp shirt in hand, and freezes when he sees them. \n\u201cHe asleep?\u201d Dabi asks.\nHawks cranes his neck to check of Toma\u2019s eyes are closed. \u201cLooks like. I\u2019m gonna lay him down in here with me, tonight.\u201d\nDabi nods. \u201cI\u2019ll head out.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Hawks says, almost regretting the words immediately, because Dabi looks at him like he\u2019s grown a second head. The back of his neck heats rapidly. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s late.\u201d\n\u201cShigaraki wants me back tonight,\u201d Dabi tells him. \n\u201cOh,\u201d Hawks says. \u201cAll right.\u201d\n\u201cHe wanted me to check up on you.\u201d Hawks\u2019s entire body goes cold with panic. It\u2019s everything he can do to keep from clutching Toma even tighter. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re not fuckin\u2019 around on us.\u201d\nHawks doesn\u2019t know what to say to that. Dabi so rarely volunteers anything to him about the League or Shigaraki or anything, really. He doesn\u2019t know why Dabi is telling him this. \n\u201cDon\u2019t tell him about Toma,\u201d Hawks whispers as Dabi comes closer, closing the distance between them until he\u2019s within touching distance, watching him with those icy eyes. They\u2019ve had this exact conversation before and Dabi\u2019s response has never changed.\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna tell him shit, bird brain.\u201d \nFor whatever reason, on this, Hawks trusts him outright. It\u2019s definitely foolish and probably a little bit of denial, but he doesn\u2019t want to consider the alternative where Dabi tells the League about his son. It would be nearly as bad if the Commission found out. He presses his nose into Toma\u2019s hair and takes a slow breath.\nHawks doesn\u2019t respond and Dabi reaches out and runs his pale fingers through Toma\u2019s damp curls. A long moment passes between them wherein neither of them says a word, but Hawks feels like Dabi is telling him something he can\u2019t hear but he desperately wants to. \nA rumble of thunder in the distance breaks the heavy silence. Hawks swallows, his eyes starting to burn again with lack of sleep.\n\u201cYou should stay,\u201d he whispers. \u201cToma likes it when you\u2019re here.\u201d\nDabi cocks his head to the side, cool, blue eyes moving over Hawks\u2019s face. \u201cHe tell you that?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard him cooing at you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? What\u2019d he say?\u201d\nHawks gets the really strange feeling that they\u2019re doing something frighteningly close to flirting right now. And they\u2019re doing it through talking about his son. Something about it feels a little wrong and a lot weird. But still, not bad.\n\u201cLearn to speak hawk and figure it out.\u201d\nDabi snorts. Thunder sounds again, closer this time. \u201cYou want me to stay?\u201d\n\u201cIs Shigaraki gonna be pissed?\u201d\n\u201cFuck him,\u201d Dabi says. \u201cI\u2019m sleeping in here, your couch is shit.\u201d Without waiting for confirmation, Dabi steps around him and into the bathroom, hanging up his shirt over the shower door track. \nHawks nuzzles into Toma\u2019s hair again and heads for the bed. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to sleep in any other position besides on his stomach, and Toma is too young yet for his feathers to detach, so he can\u2019t sleep any other way. Hawks lays him down and Toma draws his knees up under him, sticking his fist into his mouth and sucking at it without so much as a flutter of his eyelids. \nDabi quietly changes into a pair of his sweatpants and Hawks avoids looking at him while he does. Seeing the state of his back was enough, he doesn\u2019t want to be caught eyeing his legs on top of it. He settles in on his stomach and Dabi climbs in carefully on the other side of Toma, lying on his back.\nThe wind picks up outside and Hawks hears the random spattering of raindrops against the window. He hopes that it doesn\u2019t outright storm because he wants Toma to sleep through the rest of the night, so that Hawks can sleep too.\nDabi closes his eyes and tucks an arm behind his head; the stretch of scar tissue and staples looks painful but there\u2019s no indication of it on his face. For what feels like the millionth time, Hawks wonders if it hurts him or if it\u2019s just background noise to him, at this point. For the millionth time, he doesn\u2019t ask.\n\u201cThank you for helping me,\u201d Hawks whispers, his own eyes falling shut.\nDabi doesn\u2019t respond for so long that Hawks thinks he\u2019s fallen asleep. Several seconds later, a quiet, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d is barely audible over the sound of the rain.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nAlmost a month later, Hawks wakes up to the buzzing of his burner phone. After weeks of sleeping through the night, Toma has suddenly started waking up again for long periods of time, and fussing when it\u2019s time for him to go to bed. That, combined with the stress of returning to a semi-regular patrol schedule, means he\u2019s exhausted enough that he almost doesn\u2019t even reach for it.\nHe answers just before it goes to voicemail. \n\u201cWhat.\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound like a question.\nDabi\u2019s heavy breathing greets him, followed by a strained huff of laughter. \u201cDidn\u2019t think you were gonna answer.\u201d It\u2019s immediately obvious that he\u2019s in pain.\nHawks pushes himself up onto his elbow and looks at the clock on the bedside table, suddenly feeling very awake.\n\u201cDabi? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cYou locked your balcony.\u201d\nHawks shoves himself upright and kicks his feet free of his sheets. \u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a thump that Hawks can hear both through the phone and coming from the living room. \u201cDon\u2019t be a dick. Come let me in.\u201d\nHawks doesn\u2019t respond. He thumbs the button to end the call and sets his phone down on the back of the couch as he passes by it. Dabi is slumped against one of the balcony doors that Hawks had taken to leaving unlocked when Dabi\u2019s nighttime visits started to become a regular thing. \nHe unlocks the other door and sticks his head out. The left side of Dabi\u2019s face is shiny and black with blood in the moonlight, his hair matted to his head and two of the staples missing from that side of his mouth, leaving it gaping grotesquely. \n\u201cShit,\u201d Hawks whispers, reaching out for him, \u201cget in here.\u201d Dabi lets himself be pulled, which does nothing to steady the uptick in Hawks\u2019s heartrate. He locks the door behind them. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cGot my ass kicked.\u201d\n\u201cI can see that. By who?\u201d\nDabi shrugs. \u201cYou got booze? I need a fuckin\u2019 drink.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Hawks grumbles. \u201cCan you walk?\u201d\n\u201cMade it all the way here, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\nHawks doesn\u2019t rise to any invitation to argue. \u201cMy room, go,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got first aid stuff.\u201d\n\u201cGonna take more than a band-aid, this time, little bird.\u201d\n\n\u201dGo.\u201d\n\nDabi does. \nHawks grabs him a bottle of water and a couple of towels from the hall closet before he follows. Dabi sits on the floor beside the bed, slumped forward with his face in his hands. \n\u201cTake off your jacket and your shirt,\u201d Hawks instructs him, tossing the towels on the bed and setting the water down beside him.\nIt\u2019s a testament to the amount of pain Dabi must be in that he doesn\u2019t make a remark about Hawks getting him to strip off. Hawks wets a hand towel and grabs his medical kit from under the bathroom sink.\nDabi\u2019s bloodstained shirt sits in a ball on top of his jacket as he stares dazedly at the far wall. There\u2019s blood on his chest, dripping from his jaw, and more staining the white of his belt. \nHawks climbs onto the bed behind him, sitting on the edge with one leg on either side of him. He clicks on the bedside lamp for extra light and begins to gently feel for the wound on Dabi\u2019s head.\n\u201cTalk to me. Tell me what happened.\u201d\nDabi shakes his head slightly. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\u201cIt does. Was it a hero? A villain?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Dabi asks as Hawks parts his hair around the wound on his scalp and begins to clean it with the damp towel. \u201cYou gonna go fuck \u2018em up for me?\u201d\n\u201cIf I have to.\u201d Dabi huffs a breath before sucking in the next one and holding it. \u201cWhat were you hit with?\u201d\n\u201cA fist.\u201d\nHawks wants to punch him in the back of the head. \u201cWhat did this?\u201d\n\u201cA brick wall.\u201d\n\u201cAre you concussed?\u201d Dabi shrugs. \u201cDabi.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t use your dad voice on me, birdie.\u201d\nHawks folds the towel over and pats at the cut. It\u2019s still oozing blood but it\u2019s sluggish, like it\u2019s already mostly clotted. \n\u201cYou need stitches,\u201d he says. Dabi makes a noncommittal sound. \u201cI can do it but it\u2019s gonna hurt like shit.\u201d\n\u201cJust do it, Hawks,\u201d Dabi says, his voice tired and low, like his vocal chords have been dragged down a mile of dirt road. \nHawks pops open the med kit beside him and rummages through it for a needle and suture thread. \n\u201cTake a drink of that,\u201d Hawks tells him, nudging the bottle with his toes. \nDabi does as he\u2019s told, downing half the bottle before he sets it aside again. It\u2019s frightening how well Dabi sits for the stitches. He doesn\u2019t wince or take a single strained breath or make a sound to indicate that he\u2019s in pain at all. Hawks still works as fast as he can while keeping the stitches neat and evenly spaced. Dabi sits silently the entire time. Hawks doesn\u2019t comment on it. \n\u201cAll right, done,\u201d he says, setting the needle on the bedside table to dispose of later. \u201cYou still with me, hot stuff?\u201d Dabi blows out a breath through his nose and nods. Hawks gently squeezes his shoulder, aware that there\u2019s a very good possibility that Dabi has more injuries that he can\u2019t see. \u201cLet\u2019s go clean you up.\u201d\nInstead of moving to stand, a hand curls around Hawks\u2019s ankle, just under the cuff of his sweatpants, and Dabi tips his head over onto Hawks\u2019s knee. For a moment, Hawks doesn\u2019t breathe, his throat dry and his heart pounding in his chest.\n\u201cDabi?\u201d\n\u201cGive me a second,\u201d he says. His eyes are closed.\nHawks\u2019s hand is still on his shoulder and he squeezes gently, letting his thumb rub over the ribbed scar tissue there. Neither of them moves and Hawks just counts Dabi\u2019s breaths as he watches the minutes tick away on his alarm clock.\nEventually, Dabi reaches up and takes hold of his wrist. Hawks thinks he\u2019s going to push him off, but he doesn\u2019t. He holds on and Hawks\u2019s chest aches for another reason entirely. \n\u201cYou still with me?\u201d Hawks asks after minute of silence crawls by.\nDabi nods. \u201cI have a headache.\u201d\nHawks snorts quietly. \u201cI bet. I\u2019ll get you something for it after we clean the blood off your face.\u201d Dabi just nods again, his body sagging in place, leaning against Hawks. When his hand falls away, Hawks reaches down to cup his jaw, tilting his head slightly and Dabi cracks his eye open to look up at him. Hawks\u2019s thumb settles over the hole from one of his missing staples. \u201cDo you have\u2026 replacements?\u201d\n\u201cNot on me,\u201d Dabi says, sitting upright with a nearly inaudible groan. \u201cFuck me, I\u2019m tired.\u201d\n\u201cI can tell. You\u2019ve got some killer bags under your eyes.\u201d\nDabi turns his head fully to look at him over his shoulder and then he laughs. Actually laughs. It\u2019s quiet and brief, but his eyes squint up and he fucking smiles and Hawks feels like someone punched him in the gut.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole.\u201d\nToma chooses that moment to start crying. It\u2019s enough to jolt Hawks out of the hazy stupor he\u2019s in, looking down at Dabi, who is acting worryingly unlike himself. Hawks swings his leg up over Dabi\u2019s head and gets to his feet, lifting his wings high enough to make sure he doesn\u2019t clock Dabi in the head with them. He\u2019s about to offer Dabi a hand, but he\u2019s already pushing himself upright with a groan. Hawks waits long enough to make sure that he isn\u2019t about to topple over before he leaves the room and pads down the hall. \nToma\u2019s sitting upright in his crib, eyes shining with unshed tears, and he sticks his hands up the moment that Hawks pushes the door all the way open.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby?\u201d Hawks whispers, reaching for him.\nToma snuggles in against his chest, his cries quieting to soft whines almost immediately. Hawks stands there, rocking him side to side, patting at his bottom. He doesn\u2019t need a changing and if he were hungry, he\u2019d still be crying. \n\u201cJust wanted to whine, huh?\u201d \n\u201cSounds like you,\u201d Dabi says from behind him.\nHawks flaps a hand at him. \u201cDon\u2019t come in here, he\u2019ll never go back down if he sees you.\u201d But it\u2019s too late, Toma lifts his head up off of Hawks\u2019s chest at the sound of Dabi\u2019s voice, and then Toma is smiling at him, all big cheeks and prominent bottom, middle teeth. Hawks sighs. \u201cThanks.\u201d\nDabi steps in beside him and Toma reaches out a chubby little hand. Dabi gives him a finger to wrap his little talons around. He\u2019s cleaned the blood from his face and he\u2019s changed into the sweatpants and shirt that he borrows whenever he crashes on Hawks\u2019s couch. Or in his bed. Which isn\u2019t something that Hawks wants to think about, that Dabi is apparently comfortable enough staying the night in his loft to have a favorite pair of borrowed clothing to sleep in.\nHe also tries not to think about the fact that his son\u2019s first reaction upon seeing Dabi is to smile and coo at him.\nDabi\u2019s fingers brushing aside Hawks\u2019s wings to rest against the small of his back isn\u2019t something that he\u2019s going to think too much about either. \n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a rare occasion when Dabi comes by before dark. Hawks isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s because the League seems to be mostly active under the cover of night or if it\u2019s because it\u2019s easier to hide his appearance that way, or some mix of the two. Either way, it\u2019s surprising when there\u2019s a knock at the balcony door just before it opens, and Dabi steps in. \nThe living room is bathed in warm, early afternoon sun. Toma looks positively angelic with his soft, round face, his bright amber eyes, and his downy, blonde hair. Hawks is lying on the floor with his son, who is patiently waiting for Hawks to restack the block tower he\u2019s constructing so that Toma can knock it down again. \nThey both look up at the sound of the door opening. Dabi wears a dark jacket over a hoodie, with the hood pulled up, and a mask that sits around his neck like a scarf, when he pulls it down.\nToma babbles happily at him once Dabi bares his face. \n\u201cBet coming over here is only time anyone\u2019s happy to see that ugly mug of yours,\u201d Hawks says, adding another block to the tower.\n\u201cWhy do you think I come over so often?\u201d Dabi asks, shedding his jacket and pushing his hood down before he sits on the floor beside Hawks\u2019s head.\n\u201cPure vanity. I knew it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, little sparrow,\u201d Dabi says, his voice taking on that gentle tone that Hawks still can\u2019t believe he\u2019s capable of.\nToma greets him by demolishing the stack of blocks before him and giving a full belly laugh that makes Hawks laugh in turn. He starts stacking up the blocks again.\n\u201cWanton destruction and a gleeful laugh? You\u2019re raising a little villain, Hawks.\u201d Dabi\u2019s tone is joking but the words make Hawks\u2019s stomach twist a bit, unpleasantly. \n\u201cLook at that face,\u201d Hawks says, reaching out to poke Toma\u2019s belly and listen to him laugh again. \u201cThere\u2019s not an ounce of villain in there.\u201d\nDabi leans back against the couch, stretching out his long legs and crossing them at the ankle. \n\u201cJust like his dad, then,\u201d he says, and there is no teasing there, only a matter-of-fact tone that makes Hawks\u2019s hands go cold. Before Hawks can slip fully into a panic, Dabi reaches out and plucks the block from his hovering hand and adds it to the stack.\nHawks sits upright beside him and Dabi meets his gaze evenly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar,\u201d Dabi tells him.\nHawks looks at Toma again, who is gnawing at one of the blocks, since no one is building him anything to smash with them. \n\u201cI\u2019m not a liar. I\u2019m sick of the way things are done from both ends. For what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t want to be a hero, either. I don\u2019t want to be anything but a good father.\u201d \nDabi watches him carefully and Hawks is afraid to look away from his narrow-eyed gaze; he\u2019s never seen those cool, blue eyes appear so intense before. Finally Dabi turns his attention back to Toma, who is smacking two blocks together and babbling a bit to himself.\nThe silence is too much, however. He needs to know what Dabi is thinking because it\u2019s not just his safety he has to be concerned with, anymore. Hawks licks his bottom lip, pulling it into his mouth and biting down on it briefly. \n\u201cAre you gonna tell Shigaraki?\u201d\nDabi snorts. \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck about Shigaraki. Or the League. Once I kill Endeavor, I\u2019m done with them anyway.\u201d\nThe confession is startling in its honesty, because Dabi is knowingly giving him insurance with his words. Hawks could easily use this against him, just the same as Dabi could hand him over to the League as a traitor. He doesn\u2019t entirely understand why but he thinks he\u2019s starting to see the bigger picture as it gradually comes into focus.\nHawks ignores the comment about Endeavor entirely.\nToma knocks his blocks aside and falls forward into a crawl. Hawks sees Dabi jerk, like he thought Toma was tipping over and he was going to grab for him. Toma rocks a bit in place before he gets the momentum to crawl forward toward Hawks, balancing himself with his wings arched and feathers spread.\nHawks smiles as he helps him to stand on wobbly feet, both thumbs lost in a tight-fisted grip. Toma coos at him and Hawks coos back. To his surprise\u2014and Dabi\u2019s, judging by the look on his face\u2014Toma then turns and makes the same sound at him. \nDabi huffs a breath and reaches out a hand to stroke over Toma\u2019s fuzzy head. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to make that sound, kid.\u201d\nToma lets go of Hawks with one hand to grab at Dabi\u2019s wrist; Dabi lets himself be caught and the side of his hand dragged into Toma\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s cutting teeth again,\u201d Hawks says. \u201cToma, stop.\u201d\nToma babbles something sharply at him as he dislodges Dabi\u2019s hand from his mouth. Hawks blinks as Dabi huffs a laugh, reaching over to take the baby in his hands and hold him up over his head. \n\u201cHe told you.\u201d\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d Hawks says, grinning as Toma\u2019s little wings spread out, fluttering a bit, like he wants to flap them. \u201cAre you flying?\u201d he asks as Dabi tosses him a bit, catching him soundly. Toma squeals in delight and Dabi does it again and again before settling him down on his thighs. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s his other father\u2019s quirk?\u201d Dabi asks, just lobbing the question in as easily as if they were talking about the weather.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nDabi lifts a brow at him as Toma busies himself smacking at the staples in Dabi\u2019s wrist. \u201cYou heard me. Your traits are obvious; this kid looks like a much cuter clone of you. Do you know if he has another quirk?\u201d\nHawks ignores the barb, rubbing at the side of his neck and looking at his son. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I hope not. I hope he\u2019s just like me. The wings are distinctive enough without him having something else weird manifesting later.\u201d\nDabi combs careful fingers through Toma\u2019s feathers. \u201cI like the wings.\u201d\nHeat warms Hawks\u2019s cheeks. \n\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d\n\u201cBecause his hands are fuckin\u2019 freezing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Hawks asks, reaching over to touch the back of one of Toma\u2019s hands. Dabi is right, it\u2019s absolutely frigid. \u201cHe\u2019s too young to show signs of another quirk.\u201d\nDabi tips his head to the side. \u201cApparently not.\u201d \nHawks can feel himself deflating, leaning into Dabi without thinking about it. \n\u201cWarm his hands up.\u201d He\u2019s sitting close enough to Dabi, their biceps touching, that he can feel when his body temperature rises, even if it\u2019s only slightly. Toma stares at Dabi\u2019s hand, his big eyes filled with something like curiosity, before he sticks the side of his own fist in his mouth and sucks on it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Dabi tells him. \u201cIt means he\u2019s strong.\u201d\nHawks sighs, tipping his head to the side and resting it against Dabi\u2019s shoulder. The heat of him through the thin material of his shirt is enough to make Hawks\u2019s forehead prickle with sweat, within moments. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know shit about ice quirks.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Hawks exhales and sits up again, leaning forward to plant a kiss on Toma\u2019s forehead before he gets to his feet. \u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to, huh?\u201d Toma coos up at him. Hawks turns his gaze toward Dabi, who is already looking up at him, words catching in his throat. What? part of him wants to ask, because there is something in his eyes that Hawks just doesn\u2019t understand. But he keeps his questions to himself and nudges Dabi\u2019s thigh with his bare toes. \u201cYou staying for lunch?\u201d\nDabi holds his gaze for a moment longer before he turns his attention back to Toma. \u201cSure,\u201d he says, at length.\nHawks tries not to think too hard about anything at all.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nHawks would be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t just a tiny bit afraid that Dabi is going to turn on him and turn him over as a traitor. Either to the League or to the Commission; Hawks isn\u2019t sure which one scares him more. Not for himself, but for his child. Toma never asked for any of this and Hawks loves his son more than anything. He\u2019s the first real family Hawks has ever had and he\u2019ll be dead in the ground before someone takes Toma away from him.\nHe rests easier in the knowledge that Dabi likes Toma, though. He makes it obvious that he does and Hawks doesn\u2019t know if he just likes kids, in general\u2014which seems at odds with just about everything he knows about Dabi\u2014or if he just likes Hawks\u2019s kid. \nEither way, he trusts Dabi a lot more than he doesn\u2019t. Especially when it comes to the safety of his son.\nHawks wakes when Dabi climbs into bed with him, blinking drowsily in the relative darkness of his room. The curtains are only partly drawn and the city lights filter in enough that he can see more than just the outline of Dabi as he settles in heavily beside Hawks.\nIt\u2019s been a few days since he\u2019s made an appearance at the loft or given more than a single word response to a text. He hasn\u2019t contacted Hawks for anything League related in weeks, either, acting as a buffer between him and Shigaraki without Hawks asking him to. Hawks feels like they\u2019ve hardly seen him.\n\u201cAll right?\u201d Hawks mumbles, face halfway buried in his pillow. \n\u201cFine,\u201d Dabi says. \nHawks had removed his feathers before showering and hadn\u2019t called them back before climbing into bed. It\u2019s easier to sleep without them, regardless of the position, but Hawks feels almost defenseless without them, so he rarely does it. Dabi hasn\u2019t often seen him without them, either with them re-growing after a battle or with them voluntarily removed. He does nothing to make his staring less obvious.\nHawks watches with one eye as Dabi reaches a hand out and strokes the soft feathers that remain. His touch is careful in a way that Dabi so rarely ever is, carding his fingers between feathers and setting them to rights. Hawks\u2019s arms crawl with goosebumps. Whether or not Dabi realizes it, the act of preening is wildly, incredibly intimate to Hawks. No one has ever done it for him but himself.\nHe hides the flush of his face in the crook of his arm. \u201cFeels good,\u201d he murmurs.\nDabi hums quietly, his fingers tracing down to where his wing sprouts from his back, human flesh meeting avian. Between his wings is a patch of soft, fuzzy feathers, where his body couldn\u2019t quite decide if it wanted to be entirely human or not. Dabi strokes it, fingers digging in just enough to be felt.\nHawks\u2019s dick twitches where it\u2019s pressing against his thigh and he shifts his hips, easing his legs apart slightly. Dabi continues to stroke his feathers, seemingly unaware of what he\u2019s doing to Hawks with the gentleness of his touch. It probably says something unfortunate about him that the first time Dabi puts a hand on him, without punching him, it riles him up. \nHe ignores it, though, because it genuinely feels good. The last time someone touched him in a way that wasn\u2019t entirely unpleasant, he was getting knocked up. Hawks snorts into his elbow at the thought.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dabi asks.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Hawks says, lifting his face from where he\u2019s been hiding it and setting his cheek against the pillow again, tucking his arm underneath it. \u201cJust thinking that the last time someone touched me like this, I ended up with a kid.\u201d\nIt\u2019s Dabi\u2019s turn to snort. \u201cNow that\u2019s romance.\u201d\n\u201cIs it?\u201d Hawks asks, meeting his gaze as Dabi\u2019s hand follows the dip of his spine to the dimples at the base of it. He traces them both, brushing the waistband of his sweats every couple of passes.\n\u201cI don\u2019t do romance, birdie.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not? You do domesticity just fine.\u201d\nDabi cups his ass, over his sweats and squeezes; Hawks sucks in a breath and presses his hips into the bed again. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want out of me,\u201d Dabi says, his grip turning painful for just a moment before letting go. \nHawks wants too many things. He wants too much for it to, in any way, be plausible or safe for any of them, Toma included. He shakes his head and reaches for the back of Dabi\u2019s neck, pulling him in and down. Dabi kisses him hard. It\u2019s strange, the feeling of his scarred bottom lip, rough in comparison to his upper lip, and stiff. The staples keep him from opening his mouth too far but it\u2019s enough for Hawks to get his tongue in. The inside of his mouth is hot; his entire body is hot, even the scarred parts of him. \nDabi pushes him onto his back and Hawks goes willingly, kicking his legs free of the sheets as Dabi climbs in between them. He\u2019s a hell of a lot harder now than he was a minute ago, his dick rubbing up against Dabi\u2019s through their sweats. Dabi presses him down with a firm roll of his hips, and fuck, he\u2019s hard too. Hawks wraps both arms around his shoulders, one hand fisting in his hair, holding Dabi tight against him as they kiss. \nThe roll of Dabi\u2019s hips is relentless, angled just right so that their cocks are pressed together, rubbing up against one another. It\u2019s a smooth, hard grind that has Hawks panting for breath against his mouth, leaking in his sweats in no time. It\u2019s been entirely too long since he\u2019s done more than jerk off in the shower, and even longer since he\u2019s even wanted to get off with another person.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Dabi rasps, biting his cheek before dropping his head to the sweaty crook of Hawks\u2019s neck. \nHawks hooks a leg around Dabi\u2019s, pulling him harder into each thrust, trying to keep from digging in with his talons. A hand grips his hip, pushing him down into the mattress. \n\u201cDabi, shit!\u201d\nHawks drags him back into a kiss with a sharp tug of his hair. Dabi gets to his knees and lifts Hawks with both hands on his ass, pulling them into a new position and changing the angle of his thrusts. Hawks lets go with one hand to press against the wall, giving him leverage to return the toe-curling pressure.\nDabi leans over him, one hand planted beside his head, bunching the pillow up, and the other still gripping his ass. \u201cWanna fuck?\u201d Dabi asks, his voice rough and breathless. \nHawks claws at his shoulder, listening to him hiss when one of his talons hooks in the gap between flesh and scar tissue. \n\u201cYeah, but\u2014\u201d he lets out a breath, eyes closing as Dabi gets the slide of their cocks together just right. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014have anything and I don\u2019t wanna\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGet knocked up again?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Hawks huffs, reaching up to grab Dabi\u2019s face with both hands. Dabi folds easily, laying himself against Hawks again, rutting him into the mattress with hard thrusts of his hips, smashing their mouths together, teeth pressing into lips. It hurts, it all hurts, but it\u2019s so fucking good.\n\u201cGonna come?\u201d\nHawks nods, kissing him again. \u201cNot gonna take much more.\u201d\n\u201cMe either.\u201d\nDabi doubles down on the force of his thrusts, making Hawks cry out, muffling himself against Dabi\u2019s mouth. He\u2019s so close to coming, minutes from spilling inside his sweats while Dabi ruts against him like a couple of idiot teenagers, when a sharp, wailing cry startles them both into stillness.\nThey\u2019re both panting hard, Hawks\u2019s legs shaking and his dick throbbing up against Dabi\u2019s. Neither one of them moves, holding each other still as they listen.\n\u201cTell me that wasn\u2019t the kid,\u201d Dabi rasps.\nHawks lifts his head off the pillow, listening with his sharp hearing. The door is cracked open because Hawks can\u2019t bring himself to close it when his son might cry out for him in the night. He just really, really hopes this isn\u2019t one of those times.\nToma chooses that moment to begin crying for real, loud and shaking, like he does when he\u2019s genuinely upset or hungry. Dabi collapses against him with a huff.\n\u201cI was so close,\u201d he grumbles.\nHawks doesn\u2019t want to let him go. He groans, clinging tighter to Dabi for a moment before nudging at his shoulder. Dabi rolls off of him, onto his back. The front of his sweats are tented and wet at the head and where Hawks was leaking against him. He looks gorgeous lying there in Hawks\u2019s rumpled sheets, breathing hard, eyes closed. There\u2019s a faint trail of red hair low on his belly that disappears under his waistband that Hawks wants to sink his teeth into.\nHawks hurriedly changes out of his sweats and into another pair of pajama bottoms. He\u2019s rapidly losing his erection but he can\u2019t go comfort his child with precome staining his sweats.\n\u201cNice ass,\u201d Dabi says, head lifting up off the pillow, looking at him.\nHawks flings his balled up sweatpants at him and goes to get his son. \nToma continues crying, even after Hawks picks him up and shushes him. He presses his face against Hawks\u2019s chest and cries louder. \n\u201cYou hungry?\u201d Hawks asks, making his way out to the kitchen. He doesn\u2019t have to turn on any lights, his vision sharp enough in the dark that he can see just fine. He plugs in the bottle warmer and sets about mixing formula one handed until Dabi comes out of his room, blessedly boner-free. \n\u201cCome here, you little cockblock,\u201d Dabi says, taking Toma from him.\nHawks smacks him on the bicep. \u201cDon\u2019t call him that.\u201d He\u2019s not entirely able to keep the laugh from his voice as he says it, setting the timer on the warmer and leaning back against the counter.\nToma has at least stopped crying, still whining and sniffing, but familiar enough with the process to know that he\u2019s about to eat. When the bottle is ready, Dabi lifts Toma and presses a kiss to his temple before handing him back to Hawks. The ever-present ache behind his ribs sparks anew as he fits Toma into the crook of his arm, accounting space for his wings to sit comfortably, and feeds him.\nThey watch each other in the dark, both of them equally quiet as Toma\u2019s eyes begin to droop again; Dabi with his arms folded against his scarred chest, and Hawks holding his son. This is not anything like what he\u2019d imagined his relationship with Dabi would turn out like. \nIt\u2019s better. It\u2019s a lot better. But it\u2019s still confusing as fuck because Hawks has no idea what\u2019s going to happen next. Not just with Dabi but with his life, in general. Everything is on a razor\u2019s edge, right now. Sooner or later, someone outside of the people who already know about Toma, will learn of his existence. And then absolutely everything could go to shit. \n\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too hard,\u201d Dabi says, interrupting his spiraling inner monologue. Hawks mouths fuck you at Dabi, who laughs. \u201cJust say \u2018fuck\u2019. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s gonna repeat you.\u201d\n\u201cDabi.\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking of fucking,\u201d Dabi says, pushing himself off the counter and closing the distance between them.\n\u201cI\u2019m holding a baby.\u201d\n\u201cAre you gonna be holding a baby all night?\u201d Dabi asks, putting a hand on his side; his fingers are just on the verge of being uncomfortably hot. \nHawks shakes his head. \u201cDabi...\u201d he sighs. \u201cWhat do you want from me? Besides an orgasm.\u201d\nDabi looks down at him, his eyes so bright they almost glow. \u201cWhat\u2019ll you give me?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean sex.\u201d\n\u201cNeither do I,\u201d Dabi says easily, reaching out to stroke the downy hair above Toma\u2019s ear. \u201cWhat do you want, Hawks?\u201d\nIn all of his years of living, Hawks doesn\u2019t think anyone has ever asked him that question before. Everything has always been decided for him, ever since he was a child, his options have been taken away, leaving him with a presented course of action to follow through on, whether he wanted to or not. Setting Toma\u2019s empty bottle aside, he lifts the drowsy baby up onto his shoulder to burp him. It\u2019s difficult with his wings, but he\u2019s mostly perfected it with a carefully placed pat between them.\nDabi watches him from less than a foot away, eyes on Hawks\u2019s and a hand on both him and Toma. \nHawks takes a breath and closes his eyes, tipping his head forward to rest on Dabi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI want\u2026 you to stay the night. And to work the rest of this shit out after we make each other come at least twice.\u201d\nDabi hums a sound of acknowledgment. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nHawks huffs and nudges Dabi away from him. \u201cI\u2019m gonna lay him down.\u201d He pauses a few steps away and looks back, raising a brow at Dabi. \u201cYou coming?\u201d\n\u201cIn the next five to ten minutes, with any luck.\u201d\nHawks narrows his eyes and Dabi grins, following behind him as he goes."
