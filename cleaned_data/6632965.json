    "notes": "<p>I don\u2019t write romance often, and I don't really have one OTP for Spider-Man, but I enjoyed writing this because of how innocent and fun teenage!spideytorch is. These kids are adorable and weird and I had so much fun writing their banter. Also: it's well know that I prefer NYC to love and accept Spider-Man, but I do actually see them hating him when he first starts out. Like, trash throwing, Daily Bugle supporting kind of hatred.</p>\n<p>Most people in this fic are operating under the assumption that Spider-Man is a grown adult, definitely more Sue\u2019s age than Johnny\u2019s. Warnings for consequential crappy behaviour towards a disguised!minor.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>I know Johnny is often a lot older in canon (and fanon), but teenager Johnny Storm is my lifeblood. And at first I was very critical of MCU's 15yo Peter, but I've decided that I really, really like it. </p>\n<p>This fic was supposed to be 5k at the very <em>most</em>, but it somehow tumbled into this. I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm usually a strictly gen writer. I definitely will be doing more family!team fics in the future, but maybe, maybe, more romance, too? Maybe.</p>",
    "text": "Spider-Man is a mysterious, shadowy figure in the eyes of the public. All footage of him is blurry or captured from a great distance\u2014climbing and swinging and moving in a way that doesn\u2019t seem human.\nRumours had begun to circulate of people being pushed out of the way of trucks, of muggers and rapists strung up in webbing, and people caught safely in midair before they could hit the asphalt. But even then, the Daily Bugle and the obsessed NYPD shout over the top of those claims. Louder. Drowning them out.\nIt\u2019s easy to see how a city might come to hate a hero. Spider-Man is this otherworldly, controversial figure.\nJohnny thinks he\u2019s the coolest thing ever.\nSo maybe he harbours some small measure of hero worship for the vigilante. Johnny has watched shaky YouTube videos of the guy righting tipping buses and flipping high into the air, swinging so fast and so recklessly it looks like he\u2019s flying. And Spider-Man does all of this while being slim and silent, a dark protector of New York City. Not wanting fame, but wanting to keep his city safe.\nCool. So impossibly cool.\nSlowly, other people began to think so too. Spider-Man memorabilia starts popping up; t-shirts and bedspreads, little necklaces and wristbands that proclaim the wearer\u2019s support for the masked vigilante. The city hates him for the most part, but there are some that don\u2019t. A niche who fervently support Spider-Man.\nAfter the very public, very awesome defeat of the Lizard, Johnny is officially hooked. Posters are hung on his walls, t-shirts stuffed inside of his already full drawers. Spider-Man becomes his incontestable favourite.\nHis teammates don't\u00a0agree with Johnny\u2019s enthusiasm, however.\nSue purses her lips when he comes down for dinner, his t-shirt red, an increasingly infamous symbol on his chest.\n\u201cIs that appropriate?\u201d she asks, carrying a large salad bowl from the kitchen.\n\u201cWhat, my t-shirt?\u201d Johnny glances down at it, as if to check that it hasn\u2019t suddenly sprouted swear words or pictures of naked women in his trek down the stairs.\nBen barges his way past Johnny, taking a seat at the end of the table. \u201cShe\u2019s talking about your school girl crush on that Spider-Guy, squirt.\u201d\nJohnny splutters. \u201cI don\u2019t have a crush!\u201d\n\u201cWho does Johnny have a crush on?\u201d Reed asks as he pops out from the kitchen, platter of skewed chicken in hand.\n\u201cSpider-Man,\u201d she says, fetching a pitcher of juice.\n\u201cSue! I do not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo? Then explain the t-shirt, and the posters, and the way you freeze whenever Spider-Man comes on on the news.\u201d\n\u201cI just happen to think he\u2019s cool,\u201d Johnny says, matter-of-factly. \u201cA hero can think another hero is cool without making it weird. I admire his aloofness. And his badass-ness.\u201d\n\u201cHis aloofness,\u201d Ben repeats, chuckling into his mug of beer. It\u2019s roughly the size of Johnny\u2019s head. \u201cYeah, sure, I bet that\u2019s all your admire, right?\u201d\nReed sits down on Ben\u2019s right, cutlery in hand. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the videos, too. I know he does look rather fetching in that spandex.\u201d\n\u201cHe does have a nice ass, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Sue agrees.\nJohnny makes a disgusted noise in the back of his throat, and clamps his hands over his ears. It\u2019s hard enough to live with his three adult teammates, but it\u2019s even harder to hear them talk about things like attraction and sex.\n\u201cLa-la-la! I can\u2019t hear my sister talking about other hero\u2019s asses!\u201d\nBen throws a balled up napkin at Johnny\u2019s head. The teenager catches it in one hand.\n\u201cSit down,\u201d Ben grumbles. Johnny makes a face, but obliges, taking a seat beside his sister.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a bad influence,\u201d Sue goes on. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about him.\u201d\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Reed says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t adhere to local government like we do. He could very easily turn to villainous activities without having to face the consequences. We don\u2019t know anything about him, not his name, his face. We don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing\u2014he could already be committing crimes without anyone being any wiser. Like the Bugle said, he could very easily be a menace.\u201d\nEveryone at the table makes a face at that.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t trust anything in that paper,\u201d Ben says. \u201cBut sorry, kid, Reed\u2019s got a point.\u201d\nSue takes several chicken pieces before passing the tray to Reed. She at least has the decency to look sympathetic, as she says, \u201cI just think your crush should stay only a crush, Johnny. Don\u2019t try and get close to him.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Johnny says, if only to put this conversation to rest. He munches on his chicken, a little put out. \u201cI\u2019ll stay away from Spider-Man.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn Johnny\u2019s defence, he does try to stay away from Spider-Man.\nEven if he wanted to track him down, Johnny doubts he could. If the entirety of the NYPD hadn\u2019t had any luck in pinning Spider-Man down, Johnny wouldn\u2019t either.\nThe Four continue to disapprove, and Johnny continues to watch the vigilante on YouTube and news broadcasts, and be completely unsubtle about his admiration.\nBut New York is only so big. The city is riddled with super-villains, destructive and loud and drawing the attention of every superhero in a five mile radius. Johnny\u2019s met a bunch of colleagues that way, introducing himself over the sound of gunfire, shaking hands between dodging plasma blasts. Bonding experiences in their line of work.\nHe\u2019s flying late at night. The others are tucked away in the Baxter Building, but Johnny is lead outside by an itch under his skin and clear, seductive skies.\nA big, beefy guy in a rhino costume, is doing his best to tear New York a new one. Someone barely half the villain\u2019s size flitters above him, strings of web following his arching swings\u2014\n\u201cSpider-Man!\u201d Johnny shouts, hands cupped together. \u201cDude!\u201d\nThe vigilante looks up at the sound of his name. Rhino sweeps a broad hand into the air, and Spider-Man, still looking up at Johnny, flips horizontally in the air, curling into an impossibly small ball as he soars over the villain\u2019s head, dodging a hit he hadn\u2019t even been facing.\nJohnny watches as the other hero uncurls and dropkicks the villain across the face.\n\u201cOh, my god,\u201d Johnny whispers to himself. This is why Reed needs to hurry up with that fireproof phone; this would be so amazing on YouTube.\nSpider-Man uses the momentum from the kick to jump back into the air, twirling away, like a puppet on strings.\nHe flies closer. Whether it\u2019s to join the fight or introduce himself, he\u2019s not sure. He hovers above them, and the Rhino scowls.\n\u201cGo home to the Fantastic Four, child,\u201d he rumbles. \u201cThis is not your line of superhero-ing.\u201d\n\u201cHuman Torch,\u201d Spider-Man says, and Johnny almost drops out of the sky. He\u2019ll admit, this is a little much, even for him, but Spider-Man. Right there. In front of Johnny.\n\u201cI just want to say\u2014\u201d Johnny starts. Spider-Man\u2019s attention turns to him. He focusses on Johnny, like a moth drawn in by Johnny\u2019s brilliant flames, and misses the Rhino\u2019s next punch.\nJohnny\u2019s warning shout comes too late. Spider-Man tumbles out of the sky, unconscious.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSpider-Man is hurt, and Johnny\u2019s not a monster. He\u2019s not about to leave someone unconscious in the middle of New York City. Especially not someone like Spider-Man, who has a gallery of villains and a secret identity to maintain.\n\u201cWhaa\u2026?\u201d Spider-Man sits up, hand pressed against his masked temple. He tries to climb to his feet, but wobbles dangerously. Johnny gently guides him back onto the bed. \u201cWhere\u2026?\u201d\nSue clears her throat. The vigilante looks up, catches sight of Sue\u2019s Disapproving Mom face, and makes a choked, terrified noise. Johnny doesn\u2019t really blame him, honestly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Sue Storm,\u201d Spider-Man says. He looks at Johnny next. \u201cAnd you\u2019re Johnny Storm. Ohhhhh noooooo\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh no is right,\u201d Sue begins hotly.\n\u201cSue, come on, the guy\u2019s injured! I helped him home and let him crash on my bed\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOn your bed, huh?\u201d\nJohnny glowers at her, for once ignoring the innuendo. \u201cWhat, so I\u2019m not allowed to have people over? I\u2019m not allowed to have free reign over who comes in here\u2014\u201d\nSue sounds a tad hysterical as she says, \u201cNo, not when they\u2019re dangerous adults with questionable morals! You don\u2019t even know who he is behind that mask, Johnny!\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Spider-Man says. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d\n\u201cThe Baxter Building,\u201d Johnny tells him, ignoring Sue\u2019s worried, scowl-y face. Big sisters, what can you do. \u201cMy room. I carried you here after you got KO\u2019ed by Big, Bad and Ugly.\u201d\n\u201cCarried me here,\u201d Spidey repeats.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Johnny says. Sue glares at him from the doorway. \u201cHey, if it wasn\u2019t for me, he would\u2019ve been smushed by the Rhino! He would\u2019ve been road-pizza!\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have intervened,\u201d she argues.\n\u201cThanks for not letting me not be road-pizza,\u201d Spidey says. Finally, some gratitude. \u201cBut I should really go.\u201d\nBefore Johnny can grab him, the other hero clambers over the bed frame and towards the window. Johnny has never regretted owning convenient manual windows before, but as he watches his idol climb onto the windowsill, he definitely does.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t kidnap me while I\u2019m unconscious again,\u201d Spider-Man says.\n\u201cWait\u2014\u201d Johnny starts, but Spider-Man is jumping out of the window before the words have even left Johnny\u2019s lips. He stares after him. The little twirling figure of Spider-Man slowly gets smaller and smaller as he swings deeper into the sprawling city.\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Johnny whispers quietly. Reverently.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if this is creepy or pathetic or just plain sad,\u201d Ben says. \u201cProbably a sick mixture of all three.\u201d\nJohnny scowls. Ben has joined his sister in judging him not-so-silently from the hallway.\n\u201cIt\u2019s worrying, is what it is,\u201d Sue corrects. \u201cNew house rule\u2014no sneaking dangerous vigilantes into the house without the team knowing.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen I told you not to kidnap me when I was unconscious,\u201d Spider-Man says, \u201cdid you think I was joking?!\u201d\n\u201cYou said that?\u201d Johnny squints at his pizza slice, trying to recall their last encounter through the haze of admiration. \u201cHuh.\u201d\n\u201cDude,\u201d Spider-Man says. \u201cNot cool.\u201d\n\u201cSaved your life, though. Those super-villains were about to start ripping your unconscious body apart with their bare hands.\u201d\nSpider-Man regards him with those unnerving googled eyes for a long moment. It\u2019s the longest the other hero has looked at him; last time, two weeks ago ago, the guy had bolted for the window as soon as he\u2019d woken up. Now, he seems halfway willing to talk with Johnny. He counts it as a win.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Spider-Man says, \u201cthey all probably would\u2019ve, if you hadn\u2019t got me out of there. So thanks, I guess.\u201d\nJohnny slides the open pizza box towards the other hero. \u201cWant some?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Spider-Man says immediately, reaching out to scoop up a slice that\u2019s mostly just slippery cheese and pepperoni. He rolls his mask to his nose with one hand. Johnny goes still.\nSpider-Man\u2019s jaw line isn\u2019t defined, not like Reed\u2019s, and nothing like Ben\u2019s. There\u2019s none of the dark stubble he\u2019d expected, no hints of badass scars or shaving nicks. His lip is split, though, bloody and puffy and definitely sore looking.\nHe\u2019s pale. Paler than Johnny. His skin is smooth. A nasty bruise is purpling along his chin.\nSpider-Man seems to realise mid-bite what Johnny is staring at. He drops the pizza back into box like it burnt him, shoves his mask back down, and jumps to his feet.\n\u201cI should go,\u201d Spider-Man says quickly. He sounds nervous.\n\u201cNo, stay!\u201d Johnny tries to look honest, trustworthy, but he knows he probably just looks desperate. He\u2019s usually so good at making friends. People flocking to him both in and out of the suit. He\u2019s never tried to socialise with someone like this before\u2014someone mysterious and paranoid and being hunted like a dog by the NYPD, reporters, and half the super-villains in New York City.\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t even thought about\u2014\u201d Johnny gestures at Spider-Man\u2019s masked face. \u201c\u2014when I bought us pizza. I just thought that I was starving, and that you probably were, too. I promise not to stare, but. But I think you should stay.\u201d\nSpidey takes another small, anxious step back. He doesn\u2019t trust Johnny.\nJohnny\u2019s not offended. Not really. The guy doesn\u2019t seem to trust anyone, and that\u2019s not a surprise. Lone heroes are often paranoid and distrustful. If Johnny had the same reputation as Spider-Man, and the same kind of nut jobs after him, he\u2019d be a little paranoid, too.\n\u201cI carried your unconscious body, dude,\u201d Johnny says, not unkind. \u201cIf I wanted to see what was under the mask, don\u2019t you think I would\u2019ve already peaked? I mean, I didn\u2019t, but I could\u2019ve.\u201d\nSpidey exhales noisily. He sits back down.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Johnny begins, looking off into the night\u2019s cityscape, millions of lights winking against the starless backdrop, \u201cwhy are so many super-villains gunning for you? And the cops, and the Bugle, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe universe just hates me,\u201d Spider-Man says. \u201cIt\u2019s a thing.\u201d\n\u201cThe universe can\u2019t hate you. It\u2019s not a thing.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a thing! I\u2019m just doing my thing\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYour spidery thing,\u201d Johnny interrupts.\n\u201c\u2014my spidery thing,\u201d Spider-Man agrees, \u201cand next thing I know, a bunch of old guys in weird costumes are trying to kill me.\u201d\nJohnny raises an eyebrow. \u201cJust like that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I mayyyyybe got between them and their crimes, but what was I supposed to do? Let them rob those banks and destroy the city?\u201d\n\u201cFrom their point of view, yeah, you should\u2019ve just watched from the sidelines,\u201d Johnny says, laughing.\nSpidey makes a breathless noise in his throat, like all the air has been punched out of him. \u201cIf you think I should\u2019ve stood back and let them just\u2014just go around and hurt and kill innocent people\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhoa, whoa, I was totally not implying that. You\u2019re cool for helping those people. I just mean the super-villains probably aren\u2019t so keen on your heroic deeds, man.\u201d\nSpidey\u2019s indignation simmers and settles into embarrassment. The vigilante ducks his head, shoulders curling, and says, \u201cAh. Right. Sorry, I just\u2014I thought\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool,\u201d Johnny dismisses. He picks up a pizza slice. He takes his time chewing it, Spidey squirming a little beside him, while he thinks. So many questions. The perfect opportunity to ask the older, mysterious hero something no one else can.\nFinally, Johnny asks, \u201cSo. Avengers or Fantastic Four?\u201d\nSpidey starts a little. \u201cUm. Avengers.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously? I\u2019m sitting right here.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault they\u2019re cooler! They just are!\u201d\nJohnny pulls the pizza box a little closer to him. \u201cI should take this back, you ungrateful\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, nono\u2014\u201d Spidey scoops up three slices, layering them over each other like the world\u2019s greasiest sandwich, and takes a big bite. His mask is up, and there\u2019s sauce on his cheek. Johnny does his best not to stare.\n\u201cPizza or burgers?\u201d Johnny asks next.\n\u201cPizza,\u201d Spider-Man says through his full mouth. Johnny, who\u2019s lived with Ben for far, far too long, barely flinches at the bad manners.\n\u201cPirates or ninjas?\u201d\n\u201cNinjas.\u201d\nJohnny gasps. \u201cNo! Spidey, I thought I could trust you.\u201d\nSpidey laughs and takes another huge bite of his pizza stack. He smiles, and his cheeks bulge, and Johnny feels accomplished, somehow. At making the other hero comfortable in his presence.\nHe\u2019s a lot skinner up close. Johnny had thought the guy would be all rock-solid-Batman muscle, but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s lean, limbs almost delicate, hiding that ridiculous, inhumane strength.\nHe can feel his crush worsening. He can\u2019t bring himself to regret it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJohnny finds Spider-Man sat on the ledge of an apartment building, legs tucked under him, chin on his knees.\nHe hovers over him. His flames are bright in the nighttime, licking up his body and sending orange flickers over Spider-Man\u2019s suit.\n\u201cLooking a little lonely, webs,\u201d Johnny says. \u201cNeed some company?\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Spidey says. He sounds exhausted.\n\u2028Johnny lands anyway, flames giving way to tan skin and his blue suit. He collapses down next to Spidey, legs dangling over the edge. There\u2019s space between them. Spidey is tightly coiled, like a spring, or a gun about to go off; Johnny doesn\u2019t want to accidentally set him off.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Johnny coaxes. Spidey\u2019s shoulder lifts into a stiff, unhelpful shrug. \u201cOkayyyy. Well. Ben broke the couch this morning.\u201d\nSpidey doesn\u2019t move closer, but he cocks his head, confused, intrigued. Johnny takes it as permission to go on.\n\u201cYeah, he was sleepwalking. He doesn\u2019t do it much now days, not since his, er, rockification. He got up at like 8am when Sue was making breakfast, wondered out into the living room, and threw himself onto the sofa. It splintered under him.\u201d\nSpidey makes a soft, breathless sound and tucks his face into the crook of his arms, as though to hide a smile. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Johnny says. \u201cI mean, I didn\u2019t see it, because I\u2019m sane and don\u2019t get up before 9, but when I came out the couch was in pieces and Ben was all grumbly and Sue wasn\u2019t talking to him, so. I got Reed to tell me the story with enough badgering. He was there. Saw the whole thing.\u201d\n\u201cDr. Richards woke up at 8am?\u201d Spidey whisper is tentative, a little low. It makes Johnny\u2019s heart twist.\n\u201cReed? No way, man. He\u2019d pulled another all-nighter and was either getting scolded by Sue or was fetching more coffee.\u201d\nSpidey loosens the longer Johnny sits there and talks to him. Once he\u2019s thawed out, almost as talkative as the infamous rumours are beginning to say, Johnny springs to his feet.\n\u201cAre you hungry, man?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Spidey\u2019s stomach gurgles at the thought of food. Spidey ducks his head, and corrects, \u201cOkay, maybe.\u201d\nJohnny laughs and hauls the other guy to his feet. Spider-Man is cold to the touch\u2014most people are to Johnny, but the vigilante seems especially so. He lets his hands linger over silky spandex, feeling warmth flare in his stomach, spreading out over his torso, up into his face and down into his very fingertips. Spidey doesn\u2019t snatch his hand away. Johnny supposes it\u2019s just because of how warm he is to the frozen hero.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go get something to eat,\u201d Johnny says, and goes. Spider-Man, after a hesitant, bewildered pause, follows.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe door jangles when Johnny pushes it open. The shop inside is small, cosy instead of cramped, with Christmas lights dripping from the ceiling in shimmering, ropey vines. The brick walls give way to faded, outdated bands posters. The counter is weighed down by clear jars of coffee, teas, biscuits, paper mixes of hot chocolate.\nSpidey pokes a hanging plant\u2014leaves drooping, only one of many within the store\u2014and levels a glance at Johnny. \u201cThis place doesn\u2019t look like your scene.\u201d\n\u2028\u201cMy scene?\u201d Johnny repeats. \u201cWhat, cause it\u2019s not a nightclub?\u201d\nSpidey shrugs. Johnny waves off the brief flash of hurt; for some reason, he thought Spidey would be different. Like Spidey doesn\u2019t live in the same city as everyone else, with its constant swirl of invasive press and celebrity speculation, where Johny is just a pretty face or a reckless partygoer.\n\u201cIt guess I expected better of you,\u201d Spidey says at last, and this time, Johnny can hear the smile in his voice. \u201cThis place is just so\u2026 hipster-y.\u201d\n\u201cLike you\u2019re not even a little bit hipster-y.\u201d Spidey squirms a little. Johnny guesses he was exactly on the mark, on that one. \u201cYou totally are, aren\u2019t you? I bet you secretly love this place, you big old snob.\u201d\nSpidey fiddles with a succulent growing out of a fractured teacup on one of the tables. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he allows.\nJohnny\u2019s laugh is cut off by an elated cry as Carry exits the kitchen, spots him, and swoops him up into a hug.\n\u201cJohnny!\u201d she says, her German accent and dark makeup as thick as he\u2019d remembered. \u201cYou\u2019ve come for visit!\u201d\n\u201cHey, Carry,\u201d Johnny says, squeezing her gently before letting her go. She beams brightly at him. \u201cI brought a friend.\u201d\nSpidey peeks out from behind Johnny, shy under the soft lights of the restaurant and Carry\u2019s sharpening gaze. \u201cUm, hey, pleased to meet\u2014oof!\u201d\nShe sweeps Spidey up into a hug as enthusiastic as Johnny\u2019s. He has to admit, he\u2019s a little jealous; he hasn\u2019t had the chance to hug Spider-Man yet. Carrying his unconsciousness body away from murderous super-villains does not count.\n\u201cSpider-Man,\u201d she greets. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to meet some of Johnny\u2019s superhero friends. I\u2019ve seen the things you\u2019ve done for this city. Wonderful. Wonderful.\u201d\nSpidey squirms a little. \u201cIt\u2014it wasn\u2019t anything.\u201d\n\u201cIt was,\u201d Carry insists. \u201cYou\u2019re the hero this city needs, even if it hasn\u2019t recognised that yet. Some of us have already begun to see that, yes?\u201d\nShe gestures to the cork board framed between a hanging jade plant and an advertisement for a concert long since passed. It\u2019s filled with photos\u2014places from around the city, food vans and steaming meals, polaroids of smiling people, and newspaper articles of the Avengers, of the Fantastic Four, Daredevil. Spider-Man.\n\u201cO\u2014oh,\u201d Spidey stutters. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Board of New York,\u201d Carry says. \u201cWe put all of our favourite things there. This city is full of great people, and food, and places, and superheroes. So many wonderful heroes, but it is you that I am most excited about, Spider-Man.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d Spidey asks, faintly.\n\u201cYou. You are new, but you will grow, yes?\u201d\nJohnny huffs, offended, while Spidey drifts away and touches the board with feather light, reverent fingers.\n\u201cI thought I was your favourite,\u201d he whines to Carry.\nShe laughs. \u201cI love your team, Johnny, but they are more for space threats, right? Weird alien things coming to eat the planet? I prefer heroes who work in the streets for the common peoples.\u201d\n\u201cLike Spider-Man,\u201d Johnny grumbles, though he can\u2019t be too mad. He understands. Spider-Man is his favourite, too.\n\u201cLike Spider-Man,\u201d she agrees with a laugh. \u201cSpeaking of: you two go sit down. I\u2019ll bring you pasta. It\u2019s our special tonight.\u201d\nJohnny drags Spidey away from the cork board, just as the vigilante finishes snapping a photo on a cracked phone. He pulls the hero into a small booth, and doesn\u2019t comment as Spider-Man makes the cork board his wallpaper. To each their own.\n\u201cNow do you see the appeal?\u201d Johnny says. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in New York for ages, but I still feel like a stranger half the time. This place is just so big. You\u2019ve got to have those places that are just welcoming.\u201d\nSpidey hums under his breath. \u201cSometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name. And they\u2019re always glad you came.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\u201cYou wanna go where people know our troubles are all the sammmme\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIs that singing\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Cheers, dude.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nSpidey stares at him from across the tiny, rickety booth. \u201cCheers? No? Darn, I really need to thank my Au\u2014erm. My family-person for making me watch that.\u201d\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Johnny informs him.\n\u201cDrinks!\u201d Carry announces. She puts mismatching cups in front of them, a spoon and tiny biscuits stacked on the accompanying plate.\nJohnny takes a testing sip and scowls. \u201cHot chocolate? Carry. Not cool.\u201d\n\u201cIs late! No caffeine. You should be heading to bed after this.\u201d\nJohnny bickers with Carry and Spidey relaxes more and more into the soft back of the booth. This time, when he tucks his mask to his nose, no one stares at him. The other occupants ignore them, even dressed in bright spandex as they are, too focussed on late night caffeine fixes or the laptops pulled in front of them.\nThe lighting is dim and the atmosphere is soft, welcoming. Spider-Man is curled close by, and Johnny feels like he could stay in here all night, warmed by a slow influx of drinks, and pasta, and Spider-Man\u2019s presence.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJohnny\u2019s ankle is sprained. He\u2019d dropped from the sky, fire spluttering and streaming behind him like a falling comet, and landed wrong. He\u2019d survived, sure, but his head had met the asphalt hard. Blood drips into his eyes, his temple screaming at him, and he can\u2019t stand. Every time he tries, the dizziness rushes up and tips him back to the ground.\n\u201cLittle firefly,\u201d Doom taunts, \u201cyour family isn\u2019t here to protect you. What will you do now that I\u2019ve clipped your wings?\u201d\n\u201cCrr\u2014cree,\u201d Johnny stutters. \u201cCreepy.\u201d Curse his concussion for taking away Johnny\u2019s fantastic wit. If there was ever a situation that called for snappy one liners, it was this.\nA gauntlet extends. Metal fingers brush against his wet cheek, up his temple, and fists in his blond hair. Johnny\u2019s head is pulled back tight, and he screams from behind clenched teeth as his head wound is jostled.\nThe other hand brushes against his throat. \u201cFirst I\u2019ll kill you, and then I\u2019ll go after your sister\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHow about you start with me?!\u201d That echoing voice, and then the sound of something slamming roughly into metal. The gauntlet retreats. Johnny slumps against the pavement.\n\u201cOw,\u201d he says.\n\u201cOw is right.\u201d Spider-Man\u2019s mask swims into view. The vigilante is crouched nearby, inches from Johnny. He cocks a head. If Johnny didn\u2019t know any better, he\u2019d think the guy was smiling. \u201cYou okay, flame-brain?\u201d\n\u201cI left okay behind with my ribs about half an hour ago,\u201d Johnny says.\nSpidey laughs. He disappears for a few seconds, and Johnny hears the distinct thwip of webbing and Doom\u2019s swearing, and then Spider-Man\u2019s back, scooping Johnny up and carrying him away.\n\u201cWe have to go,\u201d Spidey explains. Johnny gasps as Spidey throws them into the air, airborne and tumbling through the city, so different from flying. The buildings swirl around them in a haze of colour.\n\u201cGo?\u201d Johnny repeats, nauseous and concussed.\n\u201cDoom\u2019s an A-lister, dude, and I\u2019m just one very inexperienced, very alone spider. If the Four can\u2019t take him down, I sure can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re Spider-Man,\u201d Johnny gasps into his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re. You\u2019re Spider-Man.\u201d\n\u201cThe webs and the giant spider symbol kind of give it away, don\u2019t they?\u201d\n\u201cNow, I mean\u2014you\u2019re special. You\u2019re a badass.\u201d\nSpidey laughs, and it sounds a little awkward and off-kilter even to Johnny\u2019s ringing ears. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m really, really not.\u201d\nJohnny\u2019s hand tightens on Spidey\u2019s shoulder. The spandex is too tight for Johnny to grasp at it, to curl his shaky fingers in it like he wants to, but Spider-Man is reassuringly solid beneath him. He\u2019s smaller than Johnny, shorter and thinner and nothing like he imagined, but he\u2019s here. He\u2019s real. He had Johnny\u2019s back; and by extension, he had the Four\u2019s back. Sue\u2019s back.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a hero,\u201d Johnny slurs, ears already gone deaf to Spider-Man\u2019s response, before passing out.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJohnny wakes to Sue\u2019s voice. Sue\u2019s loud, frustrated, scared voice.\nHe bolts up and immediately regrets it when the world spins and he retches.\n\u201cOh, thank god. You\u2019re awake. Please convince your family not to chop my head off, and put it on a spike in the front of the Baxter Building to ward off all the other vigilantes who might want to befriend you.\u201d\nJohnny squints. Spider-Man is stuck to his ceiling, tucked into a gravity defying, nervous little ball. Sue and Reed are stood at the end of his bed, arms crossed and looking the very picture of disappointed parents. They\u2019re both beat up, post-battle bloody, but that does nothing to soften their glares.\nHe collapses back onto the mattress. His head is screaming at him, and his ankle feels stiff, his whole body aching like he\u2019d been thrown through another building.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Johnny groans out.\n\u201cDoom happened,\u201d Ben rumbles from Johnny\u2019s bedside. Unlike Sue and Reed, he isn\u2019t casting suspicious glances at the person on their ceiling, all his focus pinned keenly on Johnny.\n\u201cFuck that guy,\u201d Johnny says.\n\u201cFuck that guy,\u201d Ben agrees, over the sounds of Sue chiding Johnny about his language.\n\u201cI punched him in the face for you,\u201d Spider-Man says. And oh right. Spider-Man had come to his valiant rescue before Doctor Doom could pummel him into dust. That was an actual thing that had happened. (Johnny\u2019s definitely going to tweet about this when he gets his energy back. His followers are going to lose their collective minds.)\n\u201cWe could\u2019ve handled it,\u201d Reed insists.\n\u201cUm, no, you couldn\u2019t\u2019ve,\u201d Spidey says. \u201cNot in time to save Johnny. You\u2019re welcome, by the way.\u201d\n\u201cMy knight in shining armour,\u201d Johnny says drily.\n\u201cHey, just returning the favour.\u201d\n\u201cI saved you twice, if I remember correctly, so you\u2019re returning one half of the favour.\u201d\nSpidey snickers into his gloved palm. The sound is so easy, reflective almost, that it makes something satisfied bloom warmly in Johnny\u2019s chest. He did that. He drew that sound from the reclusive, lonely vigilante.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have many, many opportunities to return the second half of the favour,\u201d Spidey teases, \u201cconsidering how often you\u2019re in trouble\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIs that a promise?\u201d says Johnny.\n\u201cYou provide the pizza, I\u2019ll provide the butt-saving,\u201d Spidey says.\n\u201cOkay, no,\u201d Sue interrupts. \u201cNo. Family meeting. Outside.\u201d\nJohnny starts to argue, but Reed twists a frown and shakes his head Johnny\u2019s way, and he knows he can\u2019t worm his way out of this one. Ben is already rising out of the too-small chair.\n\u201cNice to meet ya, webs,\u201d Ben tells Spider-Man.\nThe vigilante waves his hand awkwardly at his huge, departing back. \u201cNice to meet you too?\u201d he says, like he\u2019s not entirely sure.\n\u201cThanks for coming to my assist,\u201d Johnny says with an apologetic smile. His body is stiff, aching, but Johnny\u2019s fought harder feeling worse, and pushes himself out of bed and limps after his family.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen they\u2019re all in the living room, Sue whirls on him, arms crossed. The Disapproving Mom face is out again.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t die!\u201d Johnny tries, throwing his hands up in the air. \u201cYay for that!\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell, Johnny?\u201d Sue hisses.\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re not dead, Johnny,\u201d he mocks in a high-pitched voice. \u201cWhatever would I do without you? The light of my life, my perfect little brother\u2014\u201d\nBen whacks him over the head. It\u2019s gentle, for someone who\u2019s essentially a mountain of solid rock. Johnny clutches at his head and whines in pain anyway, because concussion.\n\u201cI think you should explain to us why Spider-Man is in your bedroom,\u201d Reed interjects.\n\u201cYou heard the man. He saved my life. Brought me here. End of story.\u201d That doesn\u2019t seem to be enough, judging from the matching frowns his teammates aim at him. \u201cHe\u2019s a superhero, guys! Like us. It\u2019s his job to take down super-villains and save people, remember?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a vigilante. I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to call him a superhero,\u201d Reed says.\nSue focusses all her worry and disapproval and anger at Johnny. He squirms under the weight of it, feeling nauseous in a way that\u2019s more than just the concussion. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over how dangerous and untrustworthy he is. Why is it sounding like you two have spent a lot more time together since the last time we saw him?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026because I have?\u201d\n\u201cJohnny!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been us saving each other. Or me saving him,\u201d Johnny says, proud; he\u2019s not embarrassed to admit he looks up to Spider-Man. The hero is badass, and Johnny\u2019s been able to save him, so that kind of makes him a badass by extension.\nHis words doesn\u2019t change how unimpressed Sue looks. Johnny sighs and scrubs a hand through his hair. \u201cNew York isn\u2019t that big of a place, okay? We run into each other. We\u2019re both in the same line of work, it makes sense that I\u2019ve helped him out when I\u2019ve seen him in a tight spot. You might not think much of him, but I\u2019m a superhero, and we help people, remember? All people. Illegal, vaguely creepy vigilantes included.\u201d\nThat makes Sue relent, deflating with a sigh, crossed arms slipping undone. Ben watches over the proceedings as though he\u2019s detached, like he doesn\u2019t quite have an opinion on this ongoing disagreement. He isn\u2019t siding with Johnny, but at least he isn\u2019t siding with Sue and Reed. Going up against his three adult teammates in an argument is far from new to him, but it never gets any easier. Johnny never wins.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t seek him out,\u201d Sue says, her voice a near whisper. All her anger is washed away by this quiet sadness, this worry that pulls her shoulders down and makes her look at Johnny like she\u2019s scared he\u2019s going to vanish, like so many people in their lives have before.\nJohnny\u2019s righteous anger melts with hers. \u201cYou don\u2019t know him, Sue\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo one knows him, Johnny. That\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about.\u201d\nJohnny stares at his barefeet, cold against the hardwood of the living room. He wonders if Spider-Man knows they\u2019re discussing him. Probably. For a sickening, stomach swooping moment, Johnny wonders if he\u2019s among the superheroes who have super-hearing, but quickly dismisses it. The guy can stick to walls and shoot webs and flip through high rising buildings with more grace than most flying heroes Johnny knows; he can\u2019t possible have more superpowers on top of that. That would be ridiculous. Excessive.\n\u201cI understand,\u201d Johnny says, without meaning it. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll stay away from him.\u201d\nSue pulls Johnny into a hug that he squirms against. She reaches a hand, snags Reed, and pulls him into the hug too. She doesn\u2019t have enough arms to drag Ben into the awkward hug, but when they pull away, Ben ruffles Johnny\u2019s still bloody hair and tells him he looks like shit. That\u2019s as close to I love you and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay as Ben gets.\nWhen Johnny returns to his bedroom, wind howls past his open window. Spider-Man is gone.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJohnny doesn\u2019t see Spider-Man again for a while. A long, painful while.\nSpider-Man is as active as always. The publicity around him remains as bleak and offensive as ever\u2014save for the brief, positive blip in the wake of Spider-Man rescuing the Human Torch, media darling, from Doom\u2019s clutches. But even that had been layered in speculation about the vigilante\u2019s motives. Full of maybe Spider-Man\u2019s trying to get into powerful heroes good graces, we should all be wary and Spider-Man only active because he thinks proper heroes aren\u2019t good enough, look how he interrupted the Four\u2019s battle with Doom!\nThe Bugle had implied that Spider-Man had kidnapped Johnny. That had made Ben cackle and Johnny\u2019s cheeks flush.\nJohnny\u2019s not sure what Spidey did to warrant all the bad press. He vows to ask him next time he sees him, but the time between their last interaction stretches on and the question fades and becomes irreverent.\nAnd then, almost a month after Spidey came to Johnny\u2019s aid, the Baxter Building\u2019s alarms scream to life. Everyone jumps to their feet immediately, their dinner left cooling and forgotten on the dining table.\nBut it\u2019s only Spider-Man that calls out, \u201cWhoa, whoa! I came in peace!\u201d\nSue looks ready to defend their building to the death. Reed purses his lips, his disapproval burning cool, while his wife\u2019s simmers red hot and dangerous.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Reed asks. Spider-Man, dangling from the ceiling with hands spread in surrender, has the decency to look embarrassed.\n\u201cUm,\u201d Spider-Man says. \u201cI need a favour.\u201d\n\u201cA favour,\u201d Ben says flatly.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Johnny asks eagerly. He ignores the glares the others shoot him. Spidey lands flat-footed and squirming on the hardwood floor, and Johnny bounces over to meet him.\n\u201cI know I\u2019m not your favourite person,\u201d he begins quickly. \u201cI know you\u2019re with the rest of the city in the Spider-Man must burn for his crimes crusade, but you\u2019re a team of superheroes, and superheroes are strong and powerful and help people and\u2014\u201d Spidey falters. His shoulders dip, his voice grows small. He admits, \u201cI didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go.\u201d\nSomething in Johnny\u2019s stomach twists at the way Spider-Man looks right now, tugging anxiously at his fingers, shoulders dancing around his ears, casting nervous looks at the rest of the Four.\nHe sounds scared, Johnny realises. Spider-Man sounds scared.\nHe casts a glance at his family. They look reproachful. Wary. Don\u2019t they hear how frightened Spider-Man sounds?\n\u201cWhat do you want us to do?\u201d Sue asks.\n\u201cHelp? There\u2019s this villain, Green Goblin. He\u2019s crazy, he\u2019s dangerous\u2014\u201d\nSpider-Man\u2019s voice pitches high, crackling under his panic. Johnny seems to be the only one that catches it. Spidey\u2019s a little weird, he\u2019ll admit, and he can be skittish, but he\u2019s not like this. Johnny knows Spider-Man\u2019s not this easily rattled.\n\u201cIs he attacking anyone right now?\u201d Reed asks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd have you told the authorities? The Avengers, maybe?\u201d\n\u201cWell, no\u2026 That\u2019s why I came to you\u2026\u201d\nSue\u2019s face softens, if only a little. \u201cIt was the right thing to do,\u201d she says, \u201ccoming to us.\u201d\nSpidey perks up. \u201cSo you\u2019ll help?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look in to it,\u201d Reed promises, like that\u2019s not the most bullshit cop out Johnny\u2019s ever heard.\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Spidey says. \u201cBut he\u2019s super, super dangerous\u2014I really need to search him out and take him down now\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how the Four operates,\u201d Reed cuts in sharply. Johnny winces; he knows how much the others think this is an issue. How Spider-Man conducts his business\u2014or, rather, how he makes everyone else\u2019s business, from super-villains with secret identities to purse snatches, his business\u2014rankles something for the Four.\n\u201cI know, but the Goblin is\u2014is\u2014he\u2019s savage and psychotic, and I thought\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he is. We\u2019ll look into him,\u201d Reed says. \u201cLegally. Through all the proper channels. You can\u2019t just barge your way into other people\u2019s business and take the law into your own hands.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if he comes after me?\u201d Spider-Man challenges. The panicked fear is gone from his voice, replaced by fresh, hardening steel and the kind of anger born from too many cold, lonely nights with bruised knuckles and villains thirsty for blood nipping at his heels.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve proved that you\u2019re capable of handling yourself,\u201d Reed says. \u201cIf this villain is too much, call for help.\u201d\n\u201cCall who for help?\u201d Spider-Man asks bitterly, mostly to himself. He shakes his head, and takes several quick, scuttling steps backward.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look into this Green Goblin, Spider-Man,\u201d Sue says, voice pitched soft and reassuring. Spider-Man does not look reassured.\nBen snorts. \u201cYou\u2019re a grown man,\u201d he says with his usual tact. \u201cGrown spider. Whatever.\u201d\nThe corner of Reed\u2019s lip quirks up in agreement. \u201cYou do seem very keen to prove your capability to the whole city,\u201d Reed reminds the vigilante.\nSpidey looks to Johnny, now. He can\u2019t see the other man\u2019s face behind that big-eyed mask, but his voice is a little raw, desperate. \u201cJohnny?\u201d Spider-Man pleads.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sue cuts in.\u2028\n\u201cI think you should go,\u201d Reed says.\nSpidey casts one last look in Johnny\u2019s direction, before jumping out the way he came.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJohnny sits at the dinner table with his family, finishes his meal, excuses himself to his bedroom, and jumps out the window.\nHe flies and loops around the block several times, careful to avoid the Baxter Building and its broad, telling windows.\n\u201cSPIDEY!\u201d he shouts into the echoing silence of the night. \u201cDUDE, I\u2019M SORRY!\u201d\nA web snags on his blazing ankle and quickly yanks, spinning Johnny around in mid-air before the webs can melt. Spider-Man, crouched on the shadowy side of a rooftop, hisses, \u201cShut UP, flames-for-brains!\u201d\n\u201cListen, man, I\u2019m sorry about what the Four said, I just froze and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI said shut up.\u201d A second spray of web, and the vigilante successfully drags Johnny onto the rooftop. \u201cFlame off before someone sees you.\u201d\nJohnny\u2019s flames extinguish. Spidey helps him stand on wobbly barefeet. He shivers in a tattered pair of jeans and a pyjama top.\n\u201cNext time you sneak out to apologise, wear a sweater, you moron,\u201d Spidey whispers to him.\n\u201cThanks, mom, but I\u2019m not just here to apologise. Here to help you. What exactly are we doing, by the way?\u201d\nSpidey turns to look at Johnny properly, head cocked just so. \u201cYou should go back,\u201d Spidey tells him after a pause. Johnny thought he might be grateful to have company, grateful that Johnny took this risk to help him out. The flat, disapproving quality of his voice says otherwise. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\nIndignant heat flares in Johnny\u2019s stomach and flushes through his cheeks; he went against his family to be here, in the cold and the dark with someone who, according to the larger populace of the city, doesn\u2019t deserve anyone\u2019s gratitude or help.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Johnny demands. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you. I want to help you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be staying away from me, aren\u2019t you? Your team don\u2019t want me near you.\u201d\nJohnny falters. \u201cThey don\u2019t,\u201d he allows, \u201cbut I can make my own decisions.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Spidey says, and doesn\u2019t rebuke Johnny\u2019s claim and bring up Johnny\u2019s age like a dozen heroes have before. It\u2019s a small mercy. \u201cBut they\u2019re your family, right? You should\u2026 you should listen to family, when you can.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the right thing to do. I want to do this. You\u2019re my friend, Spidey.\u201d\nJohnny knocks their shoulders together. Spidey is stiff under Johnny\u2019s weight, like he\u2019s not quite used to people coming so close for friendly reasons. Johnny throws an arm around his bony shoulders, and he loosens, warms under Johnny\u2019s blazing touch. Leans into it.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Spidey murmurs, low and raw in its gratefulness. Then, louder, lighter: \u201cDoes Sue make you wear sweaters when it\u2019s cold?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, shut up.\u201d\n\u201cI knew it; she totally does!\u201d\n\u201cI said shut up.\u201d\nJohnny pounces on Spidey, throwing all his weight onto the vigilante, feet fully leaving the ground. His weight doesn\u2019t bother Spidey, laughing and swinging them around. Johnny hangs on tight. An enthusiastic, wrestling leech.\n\u201cAre you sure you want to be here, Johnny?\u201d Spider-Man asks, like Johnny isn\u2019t slouched and struggling over him. It\u2019s a little awkward, Spidey shorter and thinner than him, but the other hero is so strong, an immovable pillar, one hand under Johnny\u2019s knee to keep him from slipping off.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Johnny tells Spidey\u2019s back. \u201cAre you sure you want me here?\u201d\nInstead of answering, Spidey steps off the rooftop and into free fall. Johnny shrieks and clings, but Spidey holds him tight, shifting until Johnny is wrapped around him. Their pendulum movements are exhilarating; a long, plummeting fall, and then a sharp pull upwards, stomach swooping, wind wrapping around them, like its helping their flight rather than struggling against them.\nIt\u2019s the adrenaline of flying for the first time. It\u2019s the relief of being caught by a teammate the first time after he\u2019d fallen without his flames. It\u2019s amazing.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey swing around the city for what must be hours. Spidey doesn\u2019t share any of his overarching plans with Johnny. He suspects Spidey is forgetting his plans anyway, caught up in this easygoing, addicting thing they have between them.\nSpidey lets Johnny look at his web-shooters up close. He was right; they\u2019re not organic. Take that, people on the internet!\nJohnny takes them to late night food vendors. He buys them burnt coffees, and the guy manning the stall gawks at them. Or rather, gawks at Spider-Man, hovering shyly behind Johnny. The Fantastic Four are familiar faces, appearing on news segments and magazine photo-shoots, but Spider-Man? He\u2019s new. He\u2019s unknown. He\u2019s a walking, controversial myth.\nJohnny\u2019s lucky he has a bigger-than-normal ego. This is enough to give a guy a complex.\nBut the Goblin does find them, eventually. Their coffees have long since been drunk, and the new thrill of web-slinging is beginning to ebb. Johnny\u2019s just starting to feel the itching burn of tiredness when Spider-Man stiffens, like a sniffer dog catching a scent. Then something on the street explodes in a fizz of brilliant light, chased by the screaming of terrified pedestrians.\n\u201cShow time,\u201d Spider-Man says, rising to his feet and bolting in the direction of the explosion. Johnny scrambles after him.\nSeveral quick pops of colour and sound follow as small explosions litter the street. People run in all directions. Cars swerve to avoid hitting them. The Green Goblin rocks above the mayhem, bent over laughing on his spluttering glider.\n\u201cWe should call the Four,\u201d Johnny decides.\nSpidey looks ready to argue, but the Goblin cackles and launches a much bigger bomb at the street. This time, the asphalt cracks and bends under the force. People shriek in fear.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Spidey says, \u201cokay. Call them. It\u2019ll be nice to fight with a team on this one.\u201d\nJohnny gropes for his fireproof comm but finds his ear empty. He fumbles with pockets for a phone. He finds nothing.\n\u201cUm,\u201d Johnny says.\n\u201cOh, no.\u201d\n\u201cThe shoes aren\u2019t the only thing I left behind?\u201d\nSpidey sighs, weary and already tired from what\u2019s about to come. \u201cWe\u2019ll do this the old fashioned way, then.\u201d\nJohnny\u2019s never fought the Green Goblin before, and he never, ever wants to again. The villains is more than just dangerous, he\u2019s reckless and erratic and willing to pull random civilians into their scuffle to get Spidey to back off. Gaudy pumpkin bombs are dropped and thrown, sending Johnny scrambling after them. He\u2019s stuck on bomb duty, destroying them before the can hit the ground and erupt. He feels like he\u2019s in the world\u2019s sickest game of catch.\nSpidey goes after Goblin, dodging and swerving swipes and thrown projectiles, managing a few times to clamber up onto the glider, only to get knocked back off by a meaty fist or a sharp bladed knife. Johnny knew Spider-Man was strong, but he hadn\u2019t quite realised how much abuse the little guy could take. No matter how many times the Goblin backhands him off the glider, and he collides hard with the asphalt or a high rising building; no matter how may slices of those quick blades he suffers; no matter how many bombs land too close to the vigilante and scorch his suit, Spider-Man keeps getting back up.\nJohnny is kind of in awe.\nThey\u2019re both still amateurs, though. Sure, Spidey doesn\u2019t have the drawback of still being a teenager like Johnny does, but he\u2019s new to the superhero game. Newer than Johnny.\nThey give it their all, but it\u2019s not enough. It\u2019s not enough.\nBombs are missed and punches are taken fully to the mouth. Three civilians have to be taken away in an ambulance. Spidey is shaking where he stands. Johnny feels like he\u2019s been hit by a truck.\nThe Goblin gets away.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey rest on the bridge. No one can see them up there, perched where only birds dare go. Spider-Man settles in like its an old couch, worn and shaped to him, and Johnny follows suit. Heights are a familiar friend.\nThe sky lightens, dawn threatening to bloom on the horizon. Johnny needs to head back soon, before the Four wake and discover he\u2019s missing. But not yet. Not yet.\nSpidey\u2019s knuckles are bleeding when he peels his gloves off. He winces as the spandex pulls on drying blood, catching on his open knuckles. The bruises look nasty, sore-looking, blooming deep and purple.\n\u201cI heal quickly,\u201d Spidey reassures when he catches Johnny staring. \u201cI usually wear fingerless gloves during the day to hide them just in case, though.\u201d\n\u201cSmart,\u201d Johnny says. He watches as Spidey pulls the mask to his nose, revealing his grin and split, puffy lip. It\u2019s hot. Oh, god, bloodied knuckles and that cheeky, full lipped smile should not be hot.\nIt\u2019s just before dawn. Everything feels soft and fresh so early in the day. The traffic is far off. The city is an afterthought. Johnny is focussed only on Spider-Man, sat so close beside him, warm and real and smiling so perfectly at him.\nAlmost instinctively, almost without thinking, like they\u2019re magnets gravitating in, they lean closer until their lips brush. It\u2019s hesitant and shy at first, before Johnny dips in fully, and they\u2019re kissing properly, his skin burning and Spider-Man soft beneath him. He doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s kissing his idol. He\u2019s kissing his crush. His friend.\nThey pull away. Spider-Man\u2019s breathing heavy, though the kiss was hardly exhaustive enough to warrant that kind of panting. It\u2019s adrenaline, Johnny thinks, his own heart beating an erratic tempo in his chest. He feels light-headed. Giddy. The kind of rush he only gets when he flies.\n\u201cHoly cannoli,\u201d Spider-Man whispers.\nJohnny stares at him. \u201cHoly cannoli? That\u2019s what you say after The Johnny Storm kisses you?\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re gonna be all arrogant about it\u2026\u201d Spidey huffs, but he\u2019s smiling.\n\u201cSomeone alert the media about your success,\u201d Johnny teases. He licks at his lips; the taste of copper is faint of his tongue. Fresh blood wells from Spidey\u2019s lip, pooling over his spit red mouth.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Spider-Man says sarcastically, \u201cbecause that would make the city like me. The Bugle would have a field day, Jameson screaming about\u2014about how I\u2019m some monster that defiles poor unsuspecting teenagers\u2014\u201d\nJohnny goes still. He stares at Spider-Man and considers a question that he hasn\u2019t thought about in a while. Not since he first started having pizza with the vigilante. It had all seemed irrelevant after he\u2019d gotten his attention and tentative friendship.\nSpidey pauses. Looks at Johnny searchingly. \u201cEverything okay\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Johnny asks hoarsely.\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Spidey ducks his shoulders, rubbing at the back of his neck. He looks embarrassed, not exactly caught out. Not like how Johnny would expect from someone who\u2019s been caught kissing underage kids.\nNot\u2014not that Johnny has ever really cared about that before. He\u2019s made out with people over 18, as uncaring and reckless as everything he does, partway because he can, partway to piss everyone off. To prove he\u2019s more than just a dumb kid.\nBut Spider-Man is something different. With a sinking feeling in his stomach, Johnny realises just how much he\u2019s come to trust the other hero. His crush is still there, red hot and yearning in his stomach, but it would disappoint him to find out someone close to, like, Ben\u2019s age went around kissing teenagers.\n\u201cSpidey,\u201d Johnny says again, slow and sure, \u201chow old are?\u201d\nSpidey shuffles. Ducks his head and looks at his hands, fidgeting in his lap.\n\u201cI\u2019m fifteen,\u201d Spidey says. Johnny stares. Spidey waves a hand in front of him. \u201cHello? Johnny? Did I break you?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a pervert,\u201d Johnny whispers. \u201cThank god.\u201d\n\u201cJohnny, what?\u201d\n\u201cThe Four thought you were creepy and weird,\u201d Johnny says. \u201cErm. No offence.\u201d\n\u201cNone taken? I think? Why did the Four think I was creepy and weird? I mean, outside of my costume, and nighttime actives, and generally strange personality and many, many flaws\u2014you know what? Never-mind. Don\u2019t answer that, I understand completely why they thought I was weird\u2014\u201d\nJohnny places a hand over Spider-Man\u2019s mouth, smothering the nervous babbling. It\u2019s a little weird, he has to admit, but it\u2019s endearing as well. Cute, almost. Spidey\u2019s mouth quirks into a smile underneath Johnny\u2019s palm, and he feels his stomach twist at the small point of contact. Johnny had kissed plenty of people before, but there\u2019s something about Spidey, something about his soft lips against his hand, that makes him feel lightheaded all over again.\n\u201cThey thought you were older,\u201d Johnny clarifies. \u201cLike, full adult older.\u201d\nJohnny removes his hand, revealing Spidey\u2019s frown. \u201cHey, plenty of superheroes are older,\u201d Spidey says. \u201cMost, actually, which is why they thought I was older, I guess. Why would that make me weird\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m sixteen.\u201d Spidey stares blankly at him. Johnny assumes the stare is blank. The mask makes it difficult to tell sometimes. Johnny adds, \u201cAnd they thought you were an adult? And they realllllly didn\u2019t want their infatuated sixteen year old teammate hanging out with a much older and very dodgy vigilante?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not dodgy\u2026\u201d Spidey says, a touch defensive. Then, his smile blooms, broad and excited, and he repeats, \u201cWait. \u2018Infatuated teammate\u2019, huh?\u201d\nJohnny shoves at him. \u201cShut up,\u201d he grumbles over the sound of Spidey\u2019s laughing.\n\u201cNuh uh! You have a crush on me! That\u2019s so embarrassing!\u201d\n\u201cDude, we literally just kissed.\u201d\u2028\nSpidey laughs and teases, \u201cStilllll. You like-like me.\u201d\nJohnny groans. \u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u201cMake me.\u201d\nJohnny leans in. Spider-Man\u2019s mask sits on his nose, showing off his teasing smile, his already healing split lip, the very faint freckles Johnny can only see inches from his face. Spidey\u2019s neck is long and pale and swanlike, and Johnny cups a tentative hand there. When Spidey doesn\u2019t flinch away from his touch, he slides it up to cradle the other teenager\u2019s jaw.\nThey\u2019re both sore and beaten from the Goblin. Neither of them had slept. Both of them needed breakfast. Neither of them cared.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs it because of how gorgeous I am?\u201d\nSpidey pulls his attention away from the screen to glare at Johnny. Without his attention, his car slides off the cliff in a whirl of pixels. This is their tenth consecutive game of Mario Kart, and it\u2019s beginning to lose their attention.\n\u201cWhy would it have anything to do with how gorgeous you are?\u201d Spidey asks slowly.\n\u201cYou admitted it! You think I\u2019m gorgeous!\u201d\n\u201cJohnny, we\u2019re dating\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Johnny points his controller at the other teenager. His own kart has stopped, the other racers whizzing past as they overtook him. \u201cWe\u2019re dating,\u201d Johnny continues, \u201cso you know I already like you. It doesn\u2019t matter much what you look like underneath your mask. You don\u2019t need to be shy just because I\u2019m, like, a male model.\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all,\u201d Spidey says, \u201cfull of yourself much? And second: you just admitted that it doesn\u2019t matter what I look like underneath my mask. So drop it.\u201d\nJohnny throws a handful of marshmallows at him. The candy bounces off of his mask and rolls across the carpet. Spidey, with all the concern for sanitation a teenage boy playing video games at 3am can possess, picks them off the chip littered floor and crams them in his mouth.\n\u201cIt matters,\u201d Johnny insists. \u201cDating you would be so much better if I knew what you looked like. A face to put to my many, many fantasies about you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot sure if that\u2019s flattering or gross, honestly.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014and actually have something to call you that\u2019s not so impersonal. Come on, babe. Don\u2019t you trust me?\u201d\nSpidey squirms, fiddling with a half empty bowl of Doritos rather than meeting Johnny\u2019s gaze. \u201cI trust you, I\u2019ve just never told anyone\u2026\u201d\nJohnny stares at him. \u201cNo one? At all? So\u2014so your family doesn\u2019t know their fifteen year old is Spider-Man?\u201d\nSpidey laughs, high and a little panicked. \u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cDude,\u201d Johnny says lowly, \u201call of New York is after your blood. That\u2019s messed up.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is why I can\u2019t tell them. It\u2019s for their own safety.\u201d Spidey huffs and stands, exhausted by this argument.\nJohnny\u2019s never had a secret identity, and from the slump in Spider-Man\u2019s shoulders, the way he runs his fingers over the crown of his mask, as though he has a nervous, unshakeable habit of scrubbing his fingers through his hair, he\u2019s very, very glad for the privilege of a public persona. For the umbrella of protection offered to him by older superheroes and the public\u2019s favour. Spider-Man doesn\u2019t have that.\n\u201cYou can tell me,\u201d Johnny says softly, like he\u2019s coaxing a stressed, hunted animal. \u201cYour family might be ordinary joes who can\u2019t protect themselves, but I\u2019m not like that. I already have super-villains gunning for me. And the Four. The Baxter Building. Superpowers.\u201d\nSpidey bits at his exposed lip. Johnny\u2019s stomach swoops at the action, but squashes the urge down. The time for attacking his boyfriend with surprise kisses will come later.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Johnny\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCome onnnnn,\u201d Johnny whines; serious conversations are boring. He\u2019s provided the logic, he\u2019s refrained from changing the subject with kisses. What more does Spidey want?\n\u201cJohnnnny,\u201d Spidey whines back.\nJohnny flails back, like a grumpy toddler who needs a nap. \u201cTell meeeee.\u201d\nSpidey flops onto his side, mirroring Johnny. \u201cNoooooo.\u201d\nSpidey rolls onto his stomach, all relaxed limbs and stretched out spandex, and Johnny pounces. A spider-sense works on super-villains and police officers armed with bullets, but not on rogue boyfriends, apparently. Good to know.\nJohnny straddles Spidey and tugs at the mask. \u201cShow me!\u201d\nThe laugh is caught in Spidey\u2019s throat. He twists out of Johnny\u2019s grasp, using his legs to flip Johnny off him. \u201cUgh, Johnny, you\u2019re heavy!\u201d\n\u201cAre you calling me fat?\u201d\n\u201cWell, if the pants don\u2019t fit\u2026\u201d\nSpidey rolls away, and Johnny races after him. Chips and marshmallows are squashed under their weight, crushed into the carpet.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for that!\u201d Johnny promises. Spidey shimmies teasingly, encouragingly, and Johnny lunges. He grips skinny wrists and secures bony hips between his legs, and Spidey lays pliant, letting himself be pinned.\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d Spidey says dramatically. \u201cI\u2019ve been caught. Whatever will I do.\u201d\n\u201cGive up the identity, webs. Show me how cute your face is!\u201d\nSpidey rises up, pushing Johnny off of him as if the older teenager was weightless. Johnny yelps, flailing and falling onto his back with a thump.\u2028\u00a0Spidey climbs over him with a triumphant grin. It\u2019s Johnny\u2019s turn to be pinned. Spidey holds him easily, like Johnny\u2019s wrestling hands are nothing to him; he supposes that they aren\u2019t, not compared to the younger\u2019s super-strength.\nHands hold Johnny to the carpet, and strong, bony knees bracket his hips. Peter smirks, leans down, and teases, \u201cProportionate strength of a spider.\u201d\n\u201cMan, that\u2019s cheating!\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Spidey decides. \u201cTotally fine. All\u2019s fair in love and war and secret identities and stuff\u2014\u201d\nJohnny groans in his impatience, throwing his head back against the carpet. His mission has been forgotten, his determination to wheedle the secret identity from Spidey completely gone. \u201cWill you just kiss me already?\u201d\nSpidey goes red. He seems to release their position, how confident and pushy he\u2019s been, and turns shy in a sudden fit of self-consciousness. \u201cOh, I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDude, don\u2019t get all nervous on me now. Kisses! I deserve them!\u201d\nJohnny wriggles in the unbreakable hold, impatient. Spidey laughs, the sound quiet, breathy. He leans in. His lips skim Johnny\u2019s.\n\u201cLike this?\u201d he teases. His breath washes across Johnny\u2019s face, all sugary pepsi and tangy pizza. It should be gross, it should be embarrassing, but Spidey makes Johnny feel flushed in a way his flames never could. The only thing he can focus on is the feel of strong, skinny fingers and the feather light brush of their lips.\n\u201cSpidey!\u201d Johnny complains. He struggles in the other teenager\u2019s grip, wanting to get up, to crash their mouths together, but Spidey keeps him firmly pinned. \u201cSpidey, c\u2019mon, no\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGet your hands off of him!\u201d\n\nSpidey freezes. Flushed together, still laying amongst littered chips and game controllers and pizza boxes, they peer guiltily up. The Fantastic Four loom in living room\u2019s threshold, all gritted teeth and furious, balled fists. Johnny hasn\u2019t seen them this angry since the last time a super-villain had tried to kill him.\nIt\u2019s Sue that had spoken, but it\u2019s Ben that strides forward, thundering steps loud against the carpeted ground. Spidey flinches as though to dart away, to scurry up the ceiling, but Ben grabs him around the neck and hauls him bodily off of Johnny.\nProportionate strength of a spider, maybe. Proportionate strength of a mountain? Not so much.\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Johnny says, fumbling to his feet. Spidey dangles in Ben\u2019s tightening grip, legs struggling for purchase against Ben\u2019s rocky torso. \u201cBen, let him go\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing in our building?\u201d Reed demands. His limbs have gone long and unnaturally wobbly around his anger, powers bleeding under his fracturing control. Experience tells Johnny that this is a very, very bad thing.\n\u201cReed!\u201d Johnny yells, grabbing one jellylike shoulder and hauling him back.\n\u201cI can make him talk,\u201d Ben promises, tightening his grip even further. Spidey splutters, his gasps for air silenced around granite fingers. \u201cOr I could make him never talk again.\u201d\n\u201cPut him down,\u201d Sue orders. Spidey wheezes into the silence her voice creates.\n\u201cSue,\u201d Ben begins, \u201cyou saw what he was trying to do to Johnny\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPut him down,\u201d Sue repeats tersely. Her voice leaves no room for argument.\nBen\u2019s grip loosens enough for Spidey to tumble away. The vigilante scampers under Ben and up the neighbouring wall, not stopping until he\u2019s crouched protectively in the corner, bracketed by two walls and the ceiling, chest heaving.\nJohnny follows him. He hovers protectively at the bottom of the wall, listening to the rough, panicked breathing of his boyfriend and keeping his eyes on his teammates.\n\u201cJohnny,\u201d Sue begins, \u201cwhat the hell did we just walk in on?\u201d\nJohnny studies his serious family. He can\u2019t lie. Not now.\n\u201cA sleepover, I guess,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were wrestling.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t trying to hurt him,\u201d Spidey says, loud with desperation, hoarse from being strangled. \u201cI swear, Johnny started it, and \u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who started it,\u201d Ben grumbles, the words echoing through him like reverberating thunder, \u201cI\u2019m gonna end it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re dating!\u201d Johnny says loudly. All eyes gravitate towards him. \u201cThat\u2019s why we were. Um. About to kiss.\u201d He doesn\u2019t want to admit these things, doesn\u2019t want to talk about them in front of his adult friends, but if it saves Spider-Man from being ripped to pieces by vengeful superheroes, then it\u2019s worth it.\nBut the Four don\u2019t back down. If anything, Johnny\u2019s declaration makes them even madder. Both men seem to grow bigger and angrier like territorial birds puffing up their feathers.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill him,\u201d Ben decides, and Reed echoes the sentiment. Spidey shrieks a little, the sound cracking and shrill, as he shoves himself even tighter against the corner, limbs curling in like a dying spider.\n\u201cIf you think you can take advantage of a teenager\u2019s crush\u2014\u201d Reed begins, stepping protectively in front of Johnny. He\u2019s stopped by Sue\u2019s hand on his chest.\nShe doesn\u2019t look at her teammates. Instead, she studies the huddled vigilante, and asks, calmly, \u201cSpider-Man, how old are you?\u201d\nReed and Ben falter. Spidey\u2019s breath remains rough and too fast, and he stays silent against the ceiling.\n\u201cSue, why would you think\u2014\u201d Reed begins.\n\u201cLook around you,\u201d Sue says, gesturing at the messy living room. He does, taking in the haphazard stack of video games and split chips with a frown. \u201cNow, Spider-Man. How old are you?\u201d\nSpidey shakes his head, no. It\u2019s Johnny that answers; \u201cHe\u2019s fifteen, Sue.\u201d\n\u201cJohnny!\u201d Spidey hisses.\n\u201cFifteen,\u201d Sue sighs.\nReed stares at Spider-Man like it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s seen him. Ben slumps, all the fight draining out of him whiplash fast.\n\u201cFifteen?\u201d Ben asks. The hardness is gone from his voice, replaced with defeat. Ashamed guilt.\n\u201cThey were play-fighting,\u201d Sue says. Johnny quickly nods, yes. \u201cNot\u2014not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe would never,\u201d Johnny vows.\n\u201cFifteen,\u201d Ben says again. \u201cFuck, I need a drink.\u201d\nSpidey shifts out of the corner. He drops flat-footed to the ground, but when Johnny reaches out to touch him, he flinches away. Takes several quick steps backward. Glances towards the door.\n\u201cIt\u2019s late. You should stay the night,\u201d Sue offers.\nSpidey splutters, still nervous, still choked out. Ben cuts in, \u201cStay, kid. It\u2019s the least we could do after we freaked out on you like that.\u201d\nReed hangs his head. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Spider-Man.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Spidey says quickly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologise, you don\u2019t like me, it\u2019s fine, no one really does, and you were just looking out for Johnny. It\u2019s good to see he has people to take care of him. I mean, goodness knows he needs it.\u201d\nJohnny squawks. \u201cI do not need it!\u201d\n\u201cYou totally do, dude,\u201d Spidey teases, snickering. \u201cYou need three super-powered babysitters to keep you in line.\u201d\n\u201cI want a divorce,\u201d Johnny tells him.\nSpidey gasps. \u201cBaby, no! What about our dreams? Our mortgage? Think of our children!\u201d\n\u201cI have fallen in love with another,\u201d Johnny says. \u201cI\u2019m going to quit my boring job at the office and run away with her.\u201d\nSpidey wails and slumps against Johnny, pretending to cry into his shoulder. Johnny stares out the window, as though detached from a loveless marriage.\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d Ben says. \u201cThere\u2019s two of them.\u201d\nSue looks as though her entire world view is being reconstructed. She\u2019s staring at Spidey in the same way Johnny\u2019s seen her stare at the especially cute children that waddle around the local parks. Like she wants to snatch them up and keep them. Protect them.\n\u201cReed,\u201d she whispers, tugging on her husband\u2019s arm, \u201cI was wrong. I was so, so wrong; they\u2019re perfect together.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSpider-Man sits stiffly at their table during breakfast. The awkward silence that fills their living room is heavy. Anticipating.\nSue lays a platter of fried eggs and toast in the centre of the table. Johnny reaches for them, and encourages Spidey to do the same. The teenager pulls his mask to his nose, but flinches and tugs it back down when Sue gasps and puts a hand over her mouth. Reed stills. Ben\u2019s cup shatters in his fist.\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Ben swears.\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d Spidey squirms like he wants to get up and run. Johnny puts a hand on his thigh under the table, and lets his palm warm, unnaturally hot. Spidey relaxes minutely under his touch.\n\u201cYou need to see a doctor,\u201d Sue decides. \u201cYou should\u2019ve already seen one, what were we thinking\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking that it wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d Ben says. He looks angry. Sickened. \u201cThat what I did wasn\u2019t\u2014wasn\u2019t that bad\u2014\u201d\nSpidey fiddles with the bottom of his mask. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cYou have bruises on your throat,\u201d Reed tells him, grimacing.\nSpidey\u2019s shoulders curl again, that familiar, nervous gesture that makes Johnny want to wrap him into a hug. \u201cOh,\u201d he says softly.\nJohnny rubs circles into Spidey\u2019s leg with his thumb. He\u2019ll admit, the bruises were bad. Ringed around the teenager\u2019s pale throat, a necklace of sore, splotchy purple. At least Ben\u2019s hand is too big to leave bruises that resemble fingerprints.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, kid,\u201d Ben says. He looks lost. He knows his words aren\u2019t enough, not to erase the bruises he\u2019s left on the teenager, but he\u2019s faltering. Unsure what else to do with the regret. The guilt.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Spidey says. \u201cReally. I heal fast; the bruises will be gone by tonight. And I\u2019ve taken a lot worse from super-villains, so, um. I\u2019m used to it.\u201d\nSue takes a seat across from Spider-Man. She tucks her hair behind her ear, steadies her breathing, and says firmly, \u201cI would like to apologise on behalf of all of us. We haven\u2019t been fair to you.\u201d\nSpider-Man starts at that. He seems honestly surprised by the apology. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been treating you badly without knowing anything about you. We thought you were some rogue adult butting into business you had no place in being. We turned you away. We thought you were taking advantage of Johnny.\u201d There\u2019s the Sue Johnny knows, all hard-edged concern and intense blue eyes. It\u2019s kind of nice, seeing that worry directed at someone other than him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Spidey.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re forgiven?\u201d Spidey says, obviously at a loss.\nReed collects two glasses of juice. He gives them to the teenagers, lays a hand over Spider-Man\u2019s shoulder, and says, \u201cLet\u2019s go get those bruises looked at, okay?\u201d\n\u201cMy mask\u2014\u201d\nSue bites at her lip, stopping herself from blurting out the many questions Johnny knows she has. Where her questions would once be probing, now they\u2019re directed by her concern. Once Spidey\u2019s gone, he has no doubt that her barrage will be directed Johnny\u2019s way. Not that he\u2019ll tell her anything about his boyfriend, of course.\n\u201cYou can keep it on,\u201d Reed says kindly. \u201cCome on.\u201d\nSpider-Man nods. He obediently follows Reed to the Med Bay.\n\u201cHe\u2019s so little\u2026\u201d Ben says, following Spidey\u2019s exit with his eyes. \u201cHow did we miss that?\u201d\nSue casts a glance at Johnny, weighing up Spider-Man against her little brother. Her lips purse, wobble. She sees it, he knows. She sees that Spider-Man is smaller than even him.\n\u201cWe had assumptions,\u201d she says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to look past them.\u201d\nThe living room falls back into that weighty silence. Johnny reaches for the plate of eggs and begins piling up Spidey\u2019s plate. It feels like all he can do for the other teenager now.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Johnny wants to invite Spider-Man over next time, he doesn\u2019t have to wait until the Four have gone out. He doesn\u2019t have to hide it.\nThis time, when Spider-Man swings into his bedroom, the younger shouts a greeting to the others. Sue, embarrassingly enough, makes them keep the bedroom door open. When they venture out to grab soda, Spidey offers up several scientific questions he\u2019s kept firmly tucked away, and Reed answers them honestly, eagerly. Ben good-naturedly teasing about them being boyfriends and makes them splutter and flush.\nIt\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s a start.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next time Doom and his infuriating, endless army attack the city, Spider-Man swings around to meet up with the Fantastic Four. Rather than sneaking around shadowy buildings and hissing quietly to catch Johnny\u2019s attention, the teenager flies through the air between Johnny and a stretched out Reed, laughing and webbing Doombots as he goes.\n\u201cSpidey!\u201d Johnny says happily. He burns a Doombot into a bubbling, warping husk, before flying higher, admiring his boyfriend\u2019s fluid flips and twirls.\n\u201cSpider-Man,\u201d Reed greets.\n\u201cHey, Johnny,\u201d Spidey says, like he\u2019s not twisted upside down and wrapped around a thrashing Doombot. \u201cHey, Dr. Richards. How are you doing?\u201d\nReed throws a Doombot at Johnny, who destroys it in a burst of flame. \u201cOh, good, good. Yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m good. Kind of bummed about this invasion though; I had literally just sat down when I saw the news.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d Johnny interrupts. \u201cBoyfriend, here! Don\u2019t I get a kiss or something?\u201d\n\u201cA bit busy, dear,\u201d Spidey says. He kicks one Doombot in the head, twists, and shoves his fist through the neck of another, spraying sparks and exposing ropy wiring.\n\u201cSpidey and Torchy,\u201d Ben heckles, \u201csitting in a tree!\u201d\n\u201cHow OLD are you?!\u201d Johnny demands.\n\u201cK-I-S-S-I-N-G!\u201d\n\u201cBen, you motherfu\u2014!\u201d Johnny throws a blast of lukewarm flame that bounces off of Ben\u2019s thick skin as easily as water off a duck.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me come up there,\u201d Sue warns over the comm. Johnny can\u2019t see her, but he knows she\u2019s somewhere on the ground, kicking ass and taking names.\n\u201cIs this is what superhero teams are really like?\u201d Spidey wonders.\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cStraight out of those funny, vaguely dysfunctional family sit-coms.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not always like this,\u201d Reed tells him gently.\u2028 \u201cYes, we are!\u201d Sue says.\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t,\u201d Johnny defends. Why did he think it was a good idea for his boyfriend to get within ten feet of his family. Why.\n\u201cWe totally are,\u201d Ben says above the sound of screeching metal and dying Doombots.\nJohnny throws another handful of flames at him. \u201cBen!\u201d\nSpidey\u2019s laugh is high and carefree, like a bell. It makes Johnny feel lightheaded. \u201cNo, no, I like it,\u201d he insists. \u201cI\u2019m kind of jealous, actually.\u201d\nJohnny\u2019s reply is lost. A Doombot launches itself at him, and he\u2019s too busy wrestling it off and trying to stay airborne.\nThe wave of Doombots grows thicker. Sue disappears into the subway stations when the Doombots worm their way down there, following the fleeing New Yorkers into the dark. Reed heads after her.\nBen stays flat-footed on the ground, battling dozens of them at once. Johnny and Spider-Man are pulled higher, deeper into the city, as the swarm thickens.\nUntil a Doombot catches Johnny unawares, hitting right over the head, and he tumbles toward the asphalt, unconscious.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJohnny wakes up to a haze of blue. He\u2019s tangled in something that\u2019s soft and smells warm\u2014a little of sweat, the faint tang of blood, but something spicy that makes him bury in deeper. His head is throbbing, but it\u2019s easily ignored. He\u2019s too comfortable, cocooned amongst blue sheets and blue comforters and faded blue pillows.\nDistantly, he can hear the buzz of a TV. The walls are thin; Johnny can hear kids shouting and playing somewhere outside. A dog barking. The faint whirl of police sirens.\nThe Baxter Building is soundproof. That realisation, if anything, pries his eyes open.\nThis bedroom is nothing like Johnny\u2019s. The posters crowding the walls are all wrong, for alternative bands, or photography, or science mumbo-jumbo. A Fantastic Four poster lounges opposite the bed, the paper a shiny, quality gloss, his family and Johnny\u2019s face blown up in detail. Johnny\u2019s face.\n\u201cUm,\u201d Johnny says. He sits up. The bedding pools around his lap. The bedspread isn\u2019t just blue\u2014it\u2019s Fantastic Four themed. \u201cUM.\u201d\n\u201cJohnny?\u201d calls a voice through the house. The bedroom door creeks open, and Johnny stills. \u201cHey, you\u2019re awake.\u201d\nJohnny doesn\u2019t recognise the face peeking shyly at him from the doorway. He\u2019d obviously been kidnapped by an insane fan. This is the only answer to the sleep hazy situation he\u2019s found himself in. Damnit, the Four had warned him this might happen.\nAt least Johnny has superpowers, and the guy across from him doesn\u2019t look like he does. The very cute, very nervous looking guy.\nThe stranger sidesteps into the room. His hair is dark and wild, fluffed around the top like he\u2019s been pulling at it, flattening it, scrubbing those bony fingers through it. He\u2019s skinny in the way only teenager\u2019s can be, all sharp elbows and a waist that dips, collarbones sharp against his faded t-shirt.\nHe bites at his lip, and Johnny\u2019s traitorous, traitorous breath stutters. He has the puffiest, pinkest lips.\n\u201cYou doing alright there, flame-brain?\u201d asks the kid. He offers a teasing, crooked smile, and Johnny almost flames his way out of the bed; he knows that smile.\n\u201cSpidey?!\u201d The other teenager pushes him back down with a firm hand. Proportionate strength. Definitely Johnny\u2019s Spidey. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 You\u2019re cute!\u201d\nSpidey swats him over the head and scowls, but Johnny can see the pleased flush that climbs up his neck. He takes in that smooth jawline and those faint, faded freckles he\u2019d glimpsed before. Now, he can see so much more; the dark sweep of lashes, eyes brown and warm, his brows bold and thick. A red indent on the arch of his nose, where glasses must have sat not too long ago.\n\u201cSpidey!\u201d Johnny repeats. He doesn\u2019t try and get up again. This time, he wraps his arms around Spidey and tugs at the boy until he tumbles, spilling over Johnny and into the bed.\nJohnny buries his face in Spidey\u2019s fluffy hair. It\u2019s dark, and thick, and so soft. He exhales and squirms closer.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t how I thought introductions would go,\u201d Spidey says into Johnny\u2019s neck. Johnny shushes him.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already been introduced, webs,\u201d Johnny mumbles. His concussion is still there, making his thoughts soupy and his sight wobbly, but Spidey is warm and real, mask-less and in jeans, Johnny tucked up in his soft, blue bed.\n\u201cYeah, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAlso, no offence but where are the others? You\u2019re not a Doombot crafted into a teenage boy, are you? Not some trick of Doom\u2019s?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a real boy,\u201d Spidey promises. \u201cThe Four got separated from us, so I kidnapped you when you fell unconscious. I shot them a quick call, don\u2019t worry. They\u2019re all safe. The Avengers have taken Dr. Doom into custody.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really got to stop kidnapping each other.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re really got to stop passing out in fights, more like.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re a couple of fainting damsels,\u201d Johnny says mournfully.\nSpidey snickers, and Johnny grins, letting his eyes slide past his boyfriend and onto the room around him. He doesn\u2019t let go of Spidey, but he does sit up a little. He squints at the bedspread. The posters. The stupidly fond expression on Spidey\u2019s face.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a Fantastic Four fan,\u201d Johnny says slowly.\nSpidey looks away. He rubs at the back of his neck in a painfully familiar way, only this time, he can see the way Spidey\u2019s brown eyes flit down and his hair flops over his forehead.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s literally a poster of my face across from us. Dude, you sleep covered in my team\u2019s symbol.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that poster before in my life,\u201d Spidey lies. \u201cAnd\u2014and you happen to share the same symbol as these scientists from Korea, total misunderstanding, I can see how you\u2019re confused\u2014\u201d\nJohnny kisses him, just to shut him up. He keeps his eyes open, if only to watch the way Spidey\u2019s face melts under Johnny\u2019s touch.\n\u201cYou\u2019re my biggest fan,\u201d Johnny teases.\nSpidey hides his face in Johnny\u2019s neck. \u201cYou guys are so cool,\u201d he complains, shy and soft-voiced. Johnny smile broadens; he has the cutest boyfriend. A cute, infamous boyfriend who could dead-lift trucks. Woof.\n\u201cI would feel weird about this, but I was a few YouTube videos away from building a shrine to you when we first met, so. It\u2019s nice to know the sentiment is returned.\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all,\u201d Spidey says, rising onto his elbows, \u201ctotally not going to build a shrine. Not even to you. I\u2019m a fan of all superheroes. Did you miss the Avengers posters? My Black Widow lampshade? And second of all: it\u2019s not the same. I\u2019m the bane of New York, and you\u2019re\u2014\u201d Spidey gestures at Johnny, sprawled out invitingly on his bed, blond hair tasselled and long, tan limbs on display. \u201cYou\u2019re that.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa, whoa!\u201d Johnny surges up from the bed. He grabs Spidey around the shoulders, grounding him, making him look at Johnny as he carefully says, \u201cSpidey, you\u2019re amazing, okay? You\u2019re this strong, butt-kicking badass. You\u2019re out there doing the right thing despite the fact that this city is so mean and ungrateful. You\u2019re so kind, and cute, and kissable, and\u2014mmm!\u201d\nSpidey doesn\u2019t move his hand from Johnny\u2019s mouth. Not even when Johnny squirms and tries to lick him. \u201cShut up,\u201d he tells him.\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Johnny complains\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s Peter. Peter Parker.\u201d\nJohnny goes still. Spidey retracts his hand, and Johnny stares at him, blue eyes wide, lips parted. Spidey grins.\n\u201cDid I break you?\u201d Spidey teases.\n\u201cSpidey,\u201d Johnny says. He shakes himself, and corrects, \u201cPeter?\u201d\n\u201cI thought you should know. This way you\u2019ll know which last name to use, instead of just signing your name \u2018Future Mrs. Spider-Man.\u2019\u201d\nIf there was any doubt that the person in front of him was Spider-Man, it promptly vanishes with the appearance of that cheeky grin.\n\u201cYou little\u2014\u201d Johnny begins.\n\u201cNow you can sign your name \u2018Mrs. Peter Parker\u2019, right? Or: \u2018Jonathan Parker.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cFrom the state of your room, I bet I\u2019d secretly find \u2018Mrs. Johnny Storm\u2019 graffitied somewhere, you giant fanboy.\u201d\n\u201cYou might find \u2018Mrs. Reed Richards\u2019,\u201d Peter admits, and Johnny gasps like he\u2019s been struck. \u201cI went through a phase, okay!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, now we really need to get a divorce.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but he\u2019s so smart! And kind of dreamy!\u201d\nJohnny puts both hands over his ears. \u201cLa-la-la, I can\u2019t hear you!\u201d\nPeter pulls Johnny\u2019s hands away. There\u2019s a bruise blooming along his temple, and a scrap healing on his chin. Peter has mask hair. Johnny\u2019s head throbs.\nHe hasn\u2019t been this happy in a long, long time.\nPeter presses a soft kiss to the corner of his mouth. \u201cForgive me?\u201d he murmurs, barely audible.\nJohnny pulls him in, deepening the kiss. When they draw away, beaming, Johnny says, \u201cI guess I forgive you. Just never tell me you, like, think my sister is hot, okay?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\"\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, you\u2019re not getting the kids in the divorce.\u201d\n\u00a0"
