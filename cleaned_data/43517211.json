    "text": "\nEverything is holding its breath inside me. Everything is waiting to explode like Christmas.\u00a0 \n\n\n- Esperanza Cordero, from The House on Mango Street\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nEnid gets the call midway through December, nearly two months after leaving Nevermore. She\u2019s sitting at her desk at home, painting her nails a shade of pink she\u2019s never tried before, when her phone starts ringing and the screen flashes an unfamiliar number up at her.\u00a0\nHer first thought, panicked and illogical, is that it\u2019s Ajax; that somehow, in the aftermath of the breakup, he got her number and called to yell at her, or worse, try to get back together. The thought is almost enough to make her screen the call, but in the end she can\u2019t resist. Curiosity killed the wolf, or however that old saying goes.\u00a0\nShe slides her thumb over the screen, careful not to smudge the fresh coat of polish on her nails, and taps the speaker button. \u201cHello?\u201d\n \u201cHello, Enid,\u201d says the voice on the other end of the line. It\u2019s a cool, impatient, disaffected voice with a dangerous undertone, and it\u2019s as familiar to Enid as her own reflection.\u00a0\nA smile breaks over Enid\u2019s face, quick and all-consuming. It\u2019s been far too long since they\u2019ve talked - she\u2019d thought it would happen more often during the break, given everything that happened last semester, but apparently even a shape-shifting serial killer and a resurrection from the dead isn\u2019t enough to make Wednesday Addams stay in touch.\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday? Wait, is this really you? You bought a phone?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d  Wednesday replies.  \u201cIt was given to me by Xavier in an attempt at what I can only assume was a romantic gesture.\u201d\u00a0 \nThe smile slides from Enid\u2019s face before she can help it. Somewhere along the way, for reasons she\u2019s not willing to fully examine, she stopped being excited for Wednesday to find a boy and instead started thinking that none of them would ever be good enough for her. She chalks it up to the fact that the one boy Wednesday kissed last semester ended up being a shapeshifting, mass-murdering demon.\u00a0\nYeah, that\u2019s definitely it. There\u2019s nothing else it could be. If Enid still feels a sickness rise in her stomach when she thinks about Xavier and Wednesday - if the idea of Xavier handing Wednesday a new phone makes her nauseous in a new and irrational way - well, there\u2019s no need to unpack all of that right now.\u00a0\n\u201cXavier gave you a phone,\u201d Enid says, her excitement dimming a little. \u201cPretty serious purchase, huh? Whatever happened to boys getting jewelry for girls?\u201d\nWednesday makes a scathing noise, and Enid smiles again at the familiarity of it.  \u201cHardly. I have no intention of ever being involved with him. I kept the phone, though.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u201cNow there\u2019s a surprise,\u201d Enid teases. \u201cHas Wednesday \u2018I refuse to be a slave to technology\u2019 Addams finally realized that social media isn\u2019t so bad? OMG, does this mean I can make you an Instagram account?\u201d\n \u201cSocial media, as I've said before, is a soul-sucking void of meaningless affirmation,\u201d  Wednesday says dismissively.  \u201cBut I do concede that perhaps, possibly, there are a few advantages to having a phone. Very, very few.\u201d \n\u201cOh, yeah? Name them.\u201d\u00a0\n \u201cFor one,\u201d  Wednesday says,  \u201cI can communicate with the rare people I don\u2019t entirely despise.\u201d \nA strange kind of feeling floods Enid\u2019s body, rushing through her like electricity through a live wire. She\u2019s had this feeling once before, she remembers - when she and Wednesday found each other at the gates of Nevermore, tired and dirt-streaked and covered in blood, and they hugged like the end of the world had come and gone already.\u00a0\nEnid shakes her head, trying to clear away the memory. \u201cThat\u2019s so sweet, Wednesday. What\u2019s the catch?\u201d\n\n \u201cWhat reason do you have to believe there\u2019s a catch?\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\u201cUh,  every reason. I\u2019d love to think that you\u2019re calling me just to catch up and gossip, because that\u2019s what besties do, but I also know that there\u2019s no way that\u2019s true. You don\u2019t do anything without intention.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m flattered,\u201d  Wednesday says, and she sounds like she actually means it.  \u201cFine, then. I\u2019m calling to invite you to the Addams family manor for the remainder of Christmas break.\u201d \nEnid\u2019s eyes go wide. She\u2019s always wondered what Wednesday\u2019s house looks like, but she figured she\u2019d never get the chance to find out. \u201cReally? You want me to visit? Are you sure?\u201d\nWednesday\u2019s voice takes on a touch of impatience.  \u201cOf course I\u2019m sure. You\u2019re my roommate.\u201d\u00a0 \nThere\u2019s the smallest pause between Wednesday\u2019s words, a stretch of space that falls between  my  and  roommate. It\u2019s the kind of place where Enid could lose herself if she isn\u2019t careful; she tries to step around it.\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d is all she can say.\u00a0\n\n \u201cSo? Will you?\u201d\u00a0 \n\nEnid ponders it for a minute. She thinks of her family and their traditions and a Christmas tree in their warm-lit living room - and then she thinks of Wednesday Addams in a Santa hat, below the mistletoe, and her heart folds like an origami crane.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d she says, excitement welling up inside of her as she speaks. \u201cI\u2019d love to come visit. Oh, and I\u2019ll bring all my holiday stuff - fuzzy socks and matching pajamas and  Home Alone on DVD and - \u201d\u00a0\n \u201cIf you have any visions of getting me to wear a matching pajama set,\u201d  Wednesday interrupts,  \u201cyou should forget them right now, or you\u2019ll find a horde of tarantulas in your room when you arrive.\u201d \nWednesday\u2019s being serious, and Enid knows it, but she can\u2019t help laughing anyway. She\u2019s missed hearing Wednesday\u2019s threats the same way she\u2019s missed her quiet sleeping breaths and her late night orchestra music and the maddening click of her typewriter keys. \u201cWhatever you say, Wednesday. I\u2019ll get you in a Santa hat one way or another.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d rather perish.\u201d  There\u2019s a pause, and then Wednesday speaks again.  \u201cI admit that I do have one ulterior motive in asking you to visit for the holidays.\u201d\u00a0 \nEnid laughs, unsurprised; there\u2019s the Wednesday she knows, even a phone line and a coast away. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u00a0\n \u201cI told my parents that I\u2019m in a relationship,\u201d  Wednesday says, offhand, like it\u2019s just another sentence and not a lightning strike to Enid\u2019s heart.  \u201cWith you, specifically.\u201d\u00a0 \nEnid\u2019s mouth falls open, her breaths becoming strangely shallow. \u201cI - uh, you what? But I, I mean, you don\u2019t - I\u2019m not - \u201d She fumbles for more words, better ones, and manages to come up with: \u201cYou aren\u2019t mine. My girlfriend. We aren\u2019t\u2026Not dating.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s the verbal equivalent of a seven car pile-up, and there\u2019s no one coming to the rescue. Enid covers her eyes in shame, hoping the phone will swallow her whole and she\u2019ll never have to speak to Wednesday again.\u00a0\n \u201cI know that,\u201d  Wednesday says, graciously ignoring Enid\u2019s complete and sudden inability to form compound sentences.  \u201cI was thinking we could employ a little subterfuge.\u201d\u00a0 \nEnid\u2019s thoughts run slow, tripping over themselves in their effort to stand straight. \u201cUm. So. Just to get this clear, are you like\u2026asking me to pretend to be your girlfriend?\u201d\u00a0\nA quiet sigh from the other end of the line.  \u201cYes, Enid, that is exactly what I\u2019m asking. Try to keep up.\u201d\u00a0 \nEnid holds back a near-hysterical laugh. Her and Wednesday. The idea is so insane that it makes perfect sense; she tries to picture it, and the painting dries in perfect living color. She remembers something she said to Wednesday once, on a day that seems like it was one day and one year ago all at once:  We work. We shouldn\u2019t, but we do.\u00a0 \nShe thinks, quick and unbidden, of that live-wire feeling in her veins when Wednesday hugged her for the first time, and then she pushes it away. That\u2019s not important now, or ever.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Enid says slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n \u201cGood. Additionally, my parents are hosting a ball on New Year\u2019s. They will expect you to be there.\u201d \n\n\u201cGot it. I\u2019ll pack a nice dress.\u201d\n \u201cVery well,\u201d  Wednesday says.  \u201cAnd, Enid\u2026\u201d\u00a0 \n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n \u201cThank you. For doing this.\u201d\u00a0 \n\nThe words are flat and monotone, and they sound like they\u2019ve been dragged out of Wednesday like blood from stones. Enid, knowing the significance here, takes them for what they are: true gratitude.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she says, glad that Wednesday can\u2019t see the smile breaking over her face right now. \u201cAny time.\u201d\u00a0\n--\nHer parents, when she tells them she won\u2019t be home for Christmas, are completely unbothered by the news. Enid wishes she could say this comes as a surprise, but it\u2019s exactly what she\u2019d been expecting. Even after she began wolfing out, there\u2019s something about Enid that lives as a perpetual disappointment in her mother\u2019s long shadow.\u00a0\nThe matter isn\u2019t helped, of course, by the fact that her wolf-out at Nevermore seems to be a one-time thing. A full moon has come and gone since, and Enid couldn\u2019t manage to shift. The shame of it still burns like tar in the back of her throat whenever she thinks about it.\u00a0\nNo wonder her mother wants to get rid of her.\u00a0\n\u201cDo give my regards to your roommate and her family,\u201d her mother tells her, casting Enid a half-glance from the corner of her eye as she tries to balance a cutting board piled high with blood-rare steaks. \u201cAnd try to be a good houseguest.\u201d\nEnid sighs heavily. \u201cI will, Mom.\u201d\n \u201cAnd,\u201d her mother continues, reaching for a dish towel and using her free hand to sweep the kitchen counter clean, \u201cbring some decent clothes along. I saw your roommate\u2019s family at Parent\u2019s Weekend, and they seem far too rich and fancy for us. You don\u2019t want to look like a ragamuffin cub around them. Maybe you should take those awful streaks out of your hair, too.\u201d\nThe tips of Enid\u2019s fingers flare hot with annoyance, her claws ready to spring out. She forces them back with a grimace that she quickly smooths into a smile when her mother looks her way again. \u201cOkay, Mom.\u201d\n\u201cOkay what?\u201d her mother questions, throwing the steaks into a large glass dish and reaching for the salt shaker. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re going to listen to me?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I hear you,\u201d Enid says. Then, under her breath: \u201cUnfortunately.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a clamor at the back door, which swings open to reveal two of Enid\u2019s brothers and three of her cousins piling into the kitchen. There\u2019s not a single girl among them. Enid sighs deeply.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, hello boys,\u201d Enid\u2019s mother says cheerfully. \u201cSit down, dinner\u2019s almost ready.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s cousins cheer loudly and then start wrestling with her brothers until they trip and fall into the hallway in a pile of fur and fists. Enid sighs yet again, wishing that anyone in her family could be nice and normal for even one minute.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure you don\u2019t want to stay for Christmas, though?\u201d her mother asks, disregarding the snarls and shrieks coming from the hall. \u201cThe whole extended family is coming, and I\u2019d love to tell them all about how you finally wolfed out. It may have been a fluke, but at least it happened once.\u201d\u00a0\nThe last trace of doubt that Enid had about going melts away into nothing. The prospect of being surrounded by an entire pack of family members wanting to hear about her first wolf-out is nothing short of awful, especially when there\u2019s a lingering, constant fear at the back of her mind that thinks her transformation at Nevermore was exactly that: a once in a lifetime chance turned lucky, never to be repeated. She\u2019s no stranger to failure, but that would be more than she could bear.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, Mom,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I want to go to Wednesday\u2019s.\u201d Then, with a slight bitterness to her tone: \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019ll even notice I\u2019m gone, really. You\u2019ll have my brothers and cousins, after all.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d her mother answers, only half listening. \u201cAlright, go pack your things and I\u2019ll take you to the airport in the morning.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid turns to go, but something keeps her in the doorway for just a moment longer. Her mother is busy with dinner again, no longer paying the slightest attention to anything else. As Enid watches, her mother sets out steaks on massive plates. She counts them: seven, one for each of her parents, brothers, and cousins. For Enid herself, there is nothing.\u00a0\nEnid leaves the kitchen and goes upstairs to pack for the trip, her ribs aching with a mix of hurt and anger.\u00a0\n--\nYoko texts her later that night for the first time in two days. Enid wonders how she can possibly tell her best friend about the Wednesday situation; knowing Yoko, it\u2019ll lead to a two hour conversation analyzing every detail and every possible outcome.\u00a0\nShe picks up her phone, preparing herself to explain something she can\u2019t even explain to herself, but it turns out she doesn\u2019t have to.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nyoko\n\nSorry I\u2019ve been MIA!!! Parents j told me last night that we\u2019re going to europe for christmas n staying for THREE WEEKS I\u2019ve been packing like crazy\u00a0\n\n I\u2019m so excited we\u2019re literally on the plane rn\u00a0 \n\n\n but the place we\u2019re staying doesn\u2019t have cell service :/// i\u2019ll miss u sm hope u have a great christmas\u00a0 \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nenid\n\n\n \u00a0\u00a0OMGGGG have so much fun !! bring me back a souvenir \n\n\n btw i\u2019m going to wednesday\u2019s for christmas \n\n\n oh and i\u2019m pretending to be her girlfriend \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nyoko\n\n\n You what \n\n\n Enid Sinclair\u00a0 \n\n\n What do you mean you\u2019re pretending to be her girlfriend\u00a0 \n\n\n Get back here we\u2019re not done talking abt this oh god the plane is taking off the flight attendant lady is yelling at me GOODBYE MERRY CHRISTM \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nEnid laughs to herself, relieved. She\u2019s sure Yoko will give her absolute hell over this when she gets back, but whatever. That\u2019s a problem for future Enid.\u00a0\n--\nThe next day, the flight to Massachusetts is quiet and uneventful. Enid sits in the window seat, keeping the shade pulled all the way open. The country unfolds beneath her, an endless tapestry of brown and green and blue, and she wonders how many lives she\u2019s passing over with every mile.\u00a0\nShe wonders, too, if anyone\u2019s outside looking up at her. If anyone sees her. She worries, not for the first time, that no one does.\u00a0\nHer phone lights up from its place on the in-flight tray table, and Enid tilts her head to read the notification. It\u2019s a text from Wednesday.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nwednesday\n\n\n I have sent Lurch to the airport to get you. Look for a tall and somewhat mournful looking man holding a sign with your name on it. Do not get lost in baggage claim; I don\u2019t trust you not to hop onto the conveyor belt just to see where it goes, or something equally asinine. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nEnid reads the message once and then reads it again, not even bothering to question the logistics of receiving a text while she\u2019s thirty thousand feet in the air. If anyone could make that happen, it\u2019s Wednesday.\u00a0\nA smile breaks over Enid\u2019s face as she looks down at Wednesday\u2019s photo on her screen, chasing away the melancholy blue of minutes before. She faces the window again just in time to see a golden cloud drift by. As the shadow of the plane\u2019s wing passes over it, the gold fades gently into black.\u00a0\n\n -- \n\nLogan Airport is a sprawling mess of chaos, and Enid nearly loses a limb trying to get through a crush of people spilling from the Dunkin\u2019 donuts line into the main walkway. She\u2019s thankful that she only brought a carry-on; if this is what it\u2019s like at the coffee shop, she can\u2019t imagine trying to fight her way through baggage claim.\u00a0\nShe drags herself out the doors to the pick-up area and looks around, surrounded by a sea of luggage and Massachusetts license plates. People are hurrying away in every direction around her: boarding buses, jumping into taxis, piling bags into minivans. Enid thinks back to Wednesday\u2019s text and reflects on the sheer impossibility of finding one tall, mournful man in the middle of this mess.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a disturbance among the people, a break in the rhythm of rush. Enid looks to her right and realizes that the crowd is dividing rapidly in halves, a sea parted by some unknown force. She takes a step closer, craning her neck for a better view. Whatever this force is, it must be near godly to control such a chaotic clusterfuck of people.\u00a0\nThe last of the crowd disperses and Wednesday Addams steps forward. Trailing in her wake is a man holding a sign that reads  Sinclair. He\u2019s very tall, and Enid has to admit - his expression is quite mournful. She barely notices him, though, because all of her attention is focused on Wednesday.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s only been a month since they last saw each other, but Wednesday looks subtly different: she stands a little taller, and her braids fall a little longer. She\u2019s wearing a black argyle sweater over a black lace long-sleeve, a black skirt, and her standard black boots; despite the familiar monochrome of her outfit, there\u2019s a kind of glow surrounding her. Enid can\u2019t tear her eyes away.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re staring,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cIs there something offensive about my appearance?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat? No, I was just - no, you\u2019re fine. I mean, your face is fine.\u201d Enid pushes one hand through her hair, flustered. \u201cI was just, uh. Anyways. Howdy, roomie!\u201d\n\u201cA remarkably eloquent response,\u201d Wednesday says, deadpan as usual.\u00a0\nEnid reaches forward instinctively, arms half-outstretched, before she remembers - this isn\u2019t their normal. One hug two months ago isn\u2019t enough to change the fact that Wednesday isn\u2019t a hugger.\u00a0\nShe begins to lower her arms again, embarrassed, when Wednesday does something unexpected, something that Enid had barely dared to hope for: she steps forward and wraps her arms around Enid, awkwardly but unmistakably.\nEnid sinks into it, her eyes fluttering closed involuntarily. She wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever get to have this again; she hadn\u2019t been naive enough to hope that one delirious night and a blood moon of adrenaline would be enough to break one habit and build another, but here it is anyway - the two of them together again, falling into each other like they did at the gates of Nevermore, all of the comfort and none of the bloodshed. She buries her head into Wednesday\u2019s shoulder, one hand rising on instinct to cradle the back of her head, and lets the rest of the world fade to the edges of her consciousness.\u00a0\nWednesday draws back, her eyes fixed on the left side of Enid\u2019s face. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize your wounds left scars.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid puts a hand to her cheek, self-conscious despite the many pep talks she\u2019s given herself in the mirror during the last month. \u201cOh. Yeah. They\u2019ve healed pretty well, but I think I\u2019m stuck with what\u2019s left of them.\u201d\n\u201cYou should be glad,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cThey were honorably won.\u201d\u00a0\nLurch clears his throat, and the two of them separate quickly. Enid looks down at the ground, feeling her face burn hot. She doesn\u2019t dare look at Wednesday.\u00a0\n\u201cCome,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cThe car is parked in the fire lane. Leave your luggage, Lurch will get it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Enid says, startled to realize that the chauffeur has already picked up her bag. \u201cSure. Thanks, Lurch.\u201d\u00a0\nLurch nods, still wearing that same mournful expression. He kind of gives Enid the creeps, and she makes a mental note to stay clear of him.\u00a0\nThe car is sleek and black, parked neatly on top of the painted notice that reads  FIRE LANE: KEEP CLEAR. Wednesday pulls open the door and steps back to let Enid in first, then climbs in after her.\u00a0\n\u201cEnid,\u201d Wednesday says quietly, leaning closer. Enid stops marveling at the expensive leather seats and tries to remember how to breathe; Wednesday\u2019s so close to her now, close enough that Enid can trace the long dark curl of her eyelashes. \u201cWell done. I think the hug looked authentic.\u201d\nAnd then Enid remembers: the scheme, the subterfuge. She\u2019s here as Wednesday\u2019s friend and roommate, but she\u2019s also here as Wednesday\u2019s fake girlfriend - and judging by the satisfied look on Wednesday\u2019s face, the third of those things is the most important.\u00a0\nThis is what Enid agreed to. It shouldn\u2019t hurt. It still does.\u00a0\nWednesday sits back in her seat, posture perfect and polished, and turns to look out the window. Her leg presses against Enid\u2019s; even through two layers of clothing, Enid feels the touch burning into her like a brand.\u00a0\n\u201cI admit, it isn\u2019t terrible to see you again,\u201d Wednesday says, quiet, the words soft enough that they won\u2019t leave the backseat. Enid sneaks a glance at her. She\u2019s still looking out the window, but there\u2019s a slight softness around her mouth that to Enid is as good as a blinding smile.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to see you too,\u201d Enid says, and tries not to weigh the meaning behind her reply.\u00a0\n--\nThey drive for over an hour, and Enid slides into half-consciousness; she woke up early to catch her flight, and she didn\u2019t sleep on the plane. She drifts in and out of dreams, conscious of nothing but the warmth of Wednesday next to her, until the car\u2019s tires rattle over gravel and Wednesday\u2019s fingers tap at her knee.\u00a0\n\u201cWake up,\u201d Wednesday says, but the command is lacking its usual imperative tone. \u201cWe\u2019re here. I don\u2019t want you to miss this.\u201d\nEnid blinks, disoriented, and then realizes her position: she\u2019s leaning against Wednesday\u2019s shoulder, her head tucked into the curve of her neck. Her hair is static-blown and messy, looking more like a heap of straw than anything else, and she\u2019s pretty sure her mouth was open while she was sleeping.\n\u201cOh, god,\u201d she mumbles. \u201cSorry. Didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep on you.\u201d\nWednesday just stares at her with an unreadable expression. Enid is saved from having to say anything else as the car rounds a bend in the seemingly endless driveway and the Addams manor comes into view. \u201cOh,  whoa.\u201d\u00a0 \nThe manor is three stories tall and pitch black, rising like some great and terrible beast against the darkening sky. Sharply angled dormer windows jut forth from the roof like teeth from the mouth of a shark; in the center, a tower reaches toward the clouds like it\u2019s trying to pull them down to earth. Detailed iron scrollwork frames the massive front doors, and the circular driveway that runs from the garage to the edge of the yard is pure obsidian.\u00a0\nIn other words, it\u2019s very terrifying and very goth. Enid can easily see how Wednesday turned out the way she did.\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s looking at her now, her face carefully blank, but Enid can tell that she\u2019s waiting for a reaction.\u00a0\n\u201cYour house,\u201d Enid says, \u201cis really depressing and  really creepy.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Wednesday says, sounding genuinely pleased. \u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoy it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t really supposed to be a compliment, but okay.\u201d Enid opens the car door and steps out onto the sleek black driveway, grabbing her bag from the backseat before Lurch can get to it. \u201cUm, is that a graveyard over there?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cA cemetery,\u201d Wednesday corrects. \u201cA graveyard is a burial plot specifically attached to a church. Yes, there\u2019s a cemetery on each side of the house. My great-grandfather had a lot of victims he deemed too special to part ways with after murdering them.\u201d Wednesday raises her hand, makes a beckoning gesture. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll show you around once we\u2019re inside.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid tips her head back as they walk the black and silver path to the front doors, doubting whether even her werewolf strength will be enough to open them, but it turns out that her doubt was unnecessary. Wednesday merely raises one hand as they approach, and the doors fall open, moved by some invisible power.\u00a0\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Enid says. \u201cThat is so fetch.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday gives her a blank look. \u201cFetch what?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s  fetch.  From  Mean Girls. Have you seriously never seen that movie?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t watch contemporary films,\u201d Wednesday says primly.\u00a0\n \u201cMean Girls isn\u2019t even that contemporary! It came out in 2004. That\u2019s like, forever ago.\u201d Enid bites at her lower lip, suddenly nervous for some reason as she adds: \u201cWe should watch it together sometime. Everyone needs to see it at least once in their life.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHm,\u201d Wednesday says, sounding extremely unconvinced, and Enid\u2019s heart drops. Then, as she crosses the threshold, Wednesday turns back and says, \u201cMaybe. If you promise to watch one of my favorite films as well.\u201d\n\u201cOh, great,\u201d Enid says apprehensively. \u201cWhat\u2019s  your  favorite? I bet it\u2019s some pretentious black and white movie with a French or Spanish title that translates to  Night of the Eternal Evil Demon Possession 3 or something like tha - oh, no way.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Addams manor is, if possible, even more impressively creepy on the inside. The ceiling is high and vaulted, soaring yards above their heads like the mouth of a cathedral. The foyer is inlaid with alternating tiles of black and white, and an elaborate black staircase sweeps grandly upwards to the second floor. The rounded dome of the ceiling bears a mural of a skeletal ship sailing a dark and stormy sea.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also  freezing. Enid is glad she wore one of her warmer sweaters, the one with the fleece lining; she\u2019s pretty sure she\u2019d be an icicle within minutes.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a morgue in here,\u201d she says, and then instantly regrets it when Wednesday looks pleased again. \u201cAre you going to give me the grand tour?\u201d\u00a0\nShe\u2019d meant it as a joke, but she\u2019s not at all surprised when Wednesday straightens her already immaculate posture, places her hands behind her back, and begins speaking in a formal tour guide voice.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Addams manor,\u201d Wednesday says, \u201cwas first built during the nineteenth century by my ancestor, Andromedus Addams, for his wife Lucretia. The original building was half the size it is now, with less sophisticated architecture. The manor was occupied for three generations of the Addams family before it briefly passed out of our hands and became appropriated by normal civilians for use as an asylum.\u201d There\u2019s a gleam of morbid interest in Wednesday\u2019s eyes as she says this part, and it\u2019s slightly worrying to Enid that she finds this endearing. \u201cHowever, the asylum closed after ten years, and - \u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday, is this your girlfriend?\u201d\u00a0\nEnid whips around, every one of her senses dialed to high alert in this unnerving new environment. Her claws are halfway out before she sees the source of the voice: a small and somewhat soft-looking boy who reminds her forcibly of Eugene, if Eugene ditched the glasses and picked up a pint of hair gel.\u00a0\n\u201cEnid, put your claws away,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cPugsley, mind your own business, or I\u2019ll fill your bed with night howlers again.\u201d\u00a0\nPugsley goes pale. \u201cWednesday,  don\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t sleep for two weeks when you did that last time.\u201d\n\u201cAnd whose fault is that?\u201d\u00a0\nEnid smothers a laugh, retracts her claws, and holds out a hand. \u201cHi, Pugsley. I\u2019m Enid - and yes, I am Wednesday\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d The word feels strange in her mouth - not because it doesn\u2019t fit, but because it fits all too well, like the title of  Wednesday\u2019s girlfriend  is an old cardigan that Enid\u2019s putting on for the first time in a long time only to realize that it\u2019s still the perfect shape.\u00a0\nPugsley shakes her hand delicately, then examines her for a long moment. His gaze is less intense than Wednesday\u2019s, but somehow more uncomfortable.\u00a0\n\u201cYour hair is weird,\u201d he declares finally. \u201cAnd too colorful.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday,  cari\u00f1o,  is this her? Is this your paramour?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s parents appear in the foyer, just as tall and intimidating as they were on Family Day. Enid swallows hard, fighting the urge to shrink down and hide.\u00a0\n\u201cHello,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s mother says, giving Enid a smile far warmer than she\u2019d expected. \u201cI\u2019m Morticia. This is Gomez. We\u2019re so thrilled to finally meet you properly.\u201d\nEnid gives them a small wave, feeling incredibly awkward. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Enid.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMother,\u201d Wednesday says flatly. \u201cFather. This is Enid Sinclair. We\u2019re going upstairs now, where we will be staying until dinner. Don\u2019t bother us, and don\u2019t even  think about trying to eavesdrop.\u201d\nWithout another word, Wednesday turns on her heel and starts up the staircase. Enid follows, giving Wednesday\u2019s parents a look that she hopes conveys both an apology and a plea to not be dismembered.\u00a0\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t I, you know, talk to them?\u201d Enid asks as she hurries to keep up with Wednesday, who\u2019s already turning at the top of the stairs and sweeping down a massive corridor illuminated by a line of torches. \u201cI want to make a good first impression.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou will during dinner,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cTrust me, you want to avoid talking to them for as long as possible. The experience is similar to being locked inside a haunted prison cell with a hundred rabid cats. And you don\u2019t have to worry; you\u2019ve already made a good first impression.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid almost trips over her own feet. \u201cYou\u2019ve been locked in a haunted prison cell? With  rabid cats?\u201d\u00a0 \n\u201cI had an interesting childhood,\u201d Wednesday says, like that explains everything. \u201cHere, this is my room.\u201d\u00a0\nShe pushes open a black lacquer door and steps inside. Enid follows, trying to erase the unpleasant image of a hundred rabid cats from her mind.\u00a0\n--\nWednesday\u2019s room is exactly what Enid pictured: a study in darkness, clean as a crypt. It\u2019s an expanded version of her side back at Nevermore - the walls and ceiling are painted a dark black, and two tall bonework windows overlook the forest on one side and the vast lake at the back of the manor on the other. The bed has black silk sheets turned over a black satin comforter, perfectly made, and two black pillows rest against an ebony headboard with a flock of ravens carved into the wooden scrollwork.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s endlessly dark and elaborate, and in a word:  Wednesday.\u00a0 \n\u201cIs this what the inside of your mind looks like?\u201d Enid asks, only partly joking.\u00a0\nWednesday takes a seat on the edge of her bed. \u201cMore or less, although my room has a lot less blood and murder in it.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid drifts over to the bookshelf, which reaches from floor to ceiling, and tilts her head sideways to read the names on the spines: Shelley, Poe, Rice, Le Fanu, Proust, Dickinson. Next to the bookshelf is an elegant writing desk; Wednesday\u2019s typewriter rests there, along with a stack of loose-leaf pages. Nearby, an old-fashioned gramophone sits on its own circular table next to a record player and a pile of large, square albums. Wednesday\u2019s cello stands upright in the corner, propped against a metal stand.\u00a0\nThe only decorations in the room are two wall-mounted shelves filled with additional books and one small painting above the bed that depicts a scorpion beneath a crescent moon. Enid, in her pink hoodie and blue sweatpants, is the only splash of color in the endless landscape of black and white.\u00a0\nAll in all, it\u2019s exactly what Enid would expect from Wednesday. It\u2019s not off-putting, though; not disturbing, the way it was when Enid first walked into their room back at Nevermore and realized that Wednesday had completely stripped the color from one side. It feels familiar now, almost comforting, like she\u2019s opened a door and walked right into the halls of Wednesday\u2019s heart.\u00a0\nShe quickly pushes that thought away. No good will come from waxing poetic about her fake girlfriend.\u00a0\n\u201cSo,\u201d she says, mostly to distract herself. \u201cWe should probably agree on some rules for this whole thing. I think we should be on the same page with, like\u2026you know. Stuff.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cStuff,\u201d Wednesday repeats, pensive. \u201cWhat  stuff do you mean, exactly?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLike\u2026\u201d Enid feels a flush spreading across her face, burning at her ears and the tops of her cheekbones. \u201cPhysical stuff. Holding hands. Other things.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday nods, unfazed. Enid\u2019s never been so grateful for the other girl\u2019s lack of visible emotion.\u00a0\n\u201cPhysical contact is okay,\u201d Wednesday decides. \u201cYou can hold my hand, or hug me, if you deem it necessary. Although I abhor public displays of affection and would normally rather lobotomize myself than partake in them, I recognize that they will be needed in order to sell our deception. As for other things, we\u2019ll cross that poorly constructed bridge when we come to it.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid nods, half disappointed and half relieved. \u201cHey, can I ask you something? Why did you tell your parents we\u2019re dating?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMy parents, for whatever reason, have always regarded me as somewhat of a problem. After the events at Nevermore, they began to worry about me more than ever. They were quite against the idea of me ever returning. When I told them about you, however, they seemed to think you were a good influence. Father actually  wept  when I explained that you saved my life.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid reaches for the scar above her eyebrow, touching it like a reflex at the memory.\u00a0\n\u201cBased on this reaction,\u201d Wednesday explains, \u201cI gathered that your presence would calm them, so I told them that we\u2019re in a relationship to make them stop worrying about me and allow me to return to Nevermore next semester. I would have returned one way or another, of course, but I\u2019d prefer to avoid more tedious conflict.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh, so now you want to go back to Nevermore,\u201d Enid says, just a trifle smug. \u201cFunny, because when you first got there you were dying to leave.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t misinterpret my reasons. In my first semester alone Nevermore provided me with a gruesome mystery, a mass murderer, and an daily opportunity to torture dozens of my so-called peers without fear of legal retribution. Of course I would return.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHm. Whatever you say.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s looking particularly murderous now, so Enid moves on to: \u201cYour parents think I\u2019m a good influence?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes. Why are you smiling like that?\u201d\u00a0\nEnid shrugs happily. \u201cI like being liked, and I like that your parents like me. And I like that  you like me enough to tell them about me.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I told them about you,\u201d Wednesday says, impatient. \u201cYou\u2019re my roommate. And don\u2019t take my parents\u2019 approval as a compliment; it places you in the same category as cacti, public displays of affection, and Italian opera.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Enid replies, and then reconsiders for a second. \u201cOkay, opera\u2019s pretty bad, but still. I like knowing that your parents like me.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday shakes her head, but there\u2019s something almost fond about the movement. At least, Enid thinks it\u2019s fond; it might just be wishful thinking on her part. She\u2019s searching for something else to say when there\u2019s a scrabbling sound from across the room and Thing pops up, scurrying across the desk and leaping to the bed.\u00a0\n\u201cThing!\u201d Enid exclaims. \u201cHow have you been? I missed you!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n I missed you too,  Thing signs. He points to Wednesday, then back at Enid.  No fun without you.\u00a0 \n\u201cThing,\u201d Wednesday says calmly. \u201cI will confiscate your manicure kit.\u201d\u00a0\nThing shudders, then hops onto Enid\u2019s shoulder. Enid laughs, raising her own hand for a fist bump that Thing happily returns. \u201cWe  have  to catch up, buddy. Want to paint each other\u2019s nails and gossip?\u201d\u00a0\n Yes,\u00a0Thing signs.  Now! He hurries back to the desk and pulls open one of the drawers, pulling out Q-tips and bottles of nail polish.\u00a0\nWednesday watches, her hands folded in her lap. \u201cIt\u2019s quite rude of you to like Thing more than you like me.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid looks at her, eyes tracing the dark and elegant lines of her profile, and thinks:  If only that were true.\u00a0 \n\u201cSorry, Wednesday,\u201d she says out loud, teasing. \u201cMaybe if you ever painted my nails I\u2019d like you better.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s usual scowl spreads wider. Thing signs something too fast for Enid to follow, and Wednesday shoots him a glare.\u00a0\n\u201cI do not,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cJust for that, you can buy your own moisturizer this week.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019d he say?\u201d Enid asks, trying to sound casual and not like she\u2019s desperately curious to know if it was something about her.\u00a0\n\u201cSomething that Thing won\u2019t be repeating, unless he wants to lose a finger.\u201d Wednesday stands from the bed, reaching for her cello. \u201cI\u2019ll let you two catch up while I practice.\u201d\u00a0\nThe word  stay  lies restless on Enid\u2019s lips. She swallows it down and watches Wednesday leave with her cello and a book of sheet music, then sighs and turns to Thing.\u00a0\n\u201cAt least I still have you,\u201d she says. \u201cOkay, what color do you want this time?\u201d\u00a0\nThing taps one finger against a dark, sparkling blue, then spreads flat against the bed. Enid uncaps the bottle and starts painting, doing her best to ignore the strains of classical music drifting through the air.\u00a0\n--\nThe north wing guest room is cold and drafty, and the bed feels like an arctic tundra. Enid shivers, curling herself into a ball beneath the covers. She\u2019d been relieved earlier when Wednesday had managed to cut dinner short, claiming that Enid needed a night to combat the jet lag before facing a full-frontal interrogation, but now she\u2019s regretting every moment that she could\u2019ve spent somewhere other than this bed.\u00a0\nSeriously, it\u2019s  frigid in here. Even Enid\u2019s fuzziest pair of socks isn\u2019t enough to keep her warm enough. She closes her eyes tightly, hoping she can force herself to sleep through sheer willpower, and she\u2019s just beginning to relax into semi-consciousness when there\u2019s a sudden whooshing sound from the corner of the room.\u00a0\nEnid sits bolt upright, all five senses straining to identify the threat. Something soars by her in a cold gust of wind, close enough to rustle her hair, and she fights back a yelp.\u00a0\n\u201cHello?\u201d she says, aiming for a fierce growl and landing somewhere near a frightened whimper. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\nAnother cold rush of wind flies past with an eerie keening sound. The hair on the back of Enid\u2019s neck stands up.\u00a0\n\u201cWhoever\u2019s there, you better leave right now,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a werewolf, and I\u2019ll wolf out if I have to.\u201d  If I can.\u00a0 \nMore cold, more wind. High-pitched laughter rings through the room this time, echoing in the corners.\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s resolve, which was already fragile, breaks completely. She leaps from her bed and throws herself out of the guest room, sprinting down the hall until she reaches Wednesday\u2019s door and bangs on it frantically.\u00a0\nIt opens to reveal Wednesday, barefoot and dressed in a long black nightgown with her hair in loose braids. \u201cEnid?\u201d\n\u201cMy room,\u201d Enid gasps. \u201cI think it\u2019s haunted. Guest room? More like  ghost  room.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGhosts don\u2019t exist; those are just ghouls in the guest room. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou put me in a room with  ghouls?  No. Nope. Uh-uh. I am not sleeping in a haunted ghost bed.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday gives her an exasperated look, then swings the door wider open to let her inside. \u201cFine.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d Enid says, watching as Wednesday climbs back into her bed. \u201cWhat - \u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGet in or get lost,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cYour choice.\u201d\nEnid slowly slides under the covers, her heartbeat a deafening riot in her ears. Wednesday\u2019s bed is so much warmer than the one in the guest room, and the covers smell like her, like the clean sharp scent of soap and the heaviness of a slate-grey sky right before the rain begins to fall. It\u2019s enough to make Enid\u2019s head spin in a new and dizzying way she can\u2019t quite explain.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d she whispers, not trusting herself to say anything else.\u00a0\n\u201cHog the covers and I\u2019ll make sure you never wake up,\u201d Wednesday replies. \u201cGoodnight, Enid.\u201d\nShe rolls onto her back and closes her eyes, her breaths quickly settling into the rhythmic pattern of sleep. Enid rolls to the side, facing away from her. Even then, it takes hours for her to fall asleep.\u00a0\n--\nEnid wakes up disoriented, still partly lost in a dream where she was running through an endless field of lavender. Midwinter sunlight streams weakly through the window\u2019s heavy black curtains, blinding her; her vision fades to a golden haze for a moment, and she blinks until it returns to normal.\u00a0\nAnd then she remembers exactly where she is, and she almost falls right out of bed.  Wednesday\u2019s  bed.\u00a0\nWednesday is still asleep next to her, flat on her back. Enid steals a glance at her, feeling oddly guilty about it. She\u2019s seen Wednesday sleeping a hundred times before, but never this closely.\u00a0\nWednesday is softer in sleep, the sharp lines of her face sliding into relaxed curves. Her braids have loosened overnight, and a strand of hair falls over one side of her face; Enid\u2019s fingers ache with the sudden desire to tuck it carefully behind her ear. This is a side of Wednesday she\u2019s hardly ever seen before: walls lowered, guard down. It\u2019s something like watching the night sky fade from black to blue.\u00a0\n\u201cI can feel you staring,\u201d Wednesday says without opening her eyes, and Enid flinches away from her so fast that she really does fall off the bed this time.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were awake,\u201d she mumbles, getting to her feet again and rubbing at her elbow. \u201cGod, you have uncomfortable floors.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t - never mind.\u201d Enid crosses over to the bathroom. \u201cDo you have an extra toothbrush? I think I forgot mine.\u201d\n\u201cLook in the cupboard under the sink,\u201d Wednesday answers, the words somewhat muffled by the door between them. \u201cBe careful, though. The water basilisks may have crawled up through the pipes again.\u201d\nEnid opens the cupboard gingerly and takes a clean toothbrush from a metal holder - it\u2019s all black, even the bristles. Of course. \u201cYou have water basilisks too? How many monsters live in this house?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThree hundred and seven at last count,\u201d Wednesday says, sliding through the gap between the door and the frame and joining Enid at the sink. \u201cThat may have changed, though. Winter is breeding season for many of the lesser species.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid pointedly ignores the fact that they\u2019re standing shoulder to shoulder in front of the black marble sink, their reflections in the mirror pressed side by side as they brush their teeth together like they\u2019re a real couple. It\u2019s not like this is anything special; it\u2019s happened dozens of times before.\u00a0\nBut that was back at Nevermore, she reminds herself, and this is at Wednesday\u2019s ancestral home, in Wednesday\u2019s personal bathroom.\nWednesday sets down her toothbrush and picks up a cup, and it\u2019s only then that Enid realizes she\u2019s been standing there like an idiot with her own brush motionless in her mouth. She quickly spits out the toothpaste foam and rinses her mouth with cold water from the faucet, which is shaped like a dragon arching its neck.\u00a0\n\u201cI would ask why there\u2019s fancy animals carved into all your furniture,\u201d Enid says, placing her toothbrush in the silver rack next to Wednesday\u2019s, \u201cbut I have to admit, the dragon sink is pretty cool.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe architect in charge of the manor\u2019s most recent renovations had a penchant for mythical creatures,\u201d Wednesday explains. \u201cHe was eaten by the lake kraken before he finished the job.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cThere\u2019s a kraken in the lake?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cJust a small one,\u201d Wednesday says, like that makes it any less terrifying. \u201cIt\u2019s less than forty meters in length, which officially classifies it as a lesser instance of its species.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSize is irrelevant,\u201d Enid protests. \u201cA kraken is a kraken.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday falls silent, studying Enid intently. Enid, who was rather cold up until this moment, feels all the blood in her body suddenly run hot. The change is so abrupt it\u2019s almost like shifting.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s toothpaste on your mouth,\u201d Wednesday announces.\nEnid swipes at the corner of her mouth. \u201cHere?\u201d\nWednesday shakes her head and tilts her head towards Enid\u2019s, considering. \u201cLower.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid wipes at her lips again, barely conscious of what she\u2019s doing. Wednesday\u2019s so close to her now, her features clean and shining in the light of the bathroom. There\u2019s a drop of water caught at the turn of her jaw; Enid finds herself envying it.\u00a0\nA bell tolls loudly from the depths of the house, a clear and striking note that echoes through the walls and splits the moment cleanly in two. Enid moves backwards almost mechanically, wondering if being in this manor is driving her insane. It must be, she thinks - there\u2019s no other explanation for the strange new emotions she\u2019s been feeling lately.\u00a0\nAnother voice, one that lives somewhere deep inside her, whispers that the emotions may be strange but they are not at all new. Enid pushes down on that voice until it goes silent, then hurries out of the bathroom.\u00a0\n\u201cThat bell was a summons,\u201d Wednesday says, a trace of resignation in her tone. \u201cPrepare yourself for the worst.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid arches an eyebrow. \u201cDeath by lake kraken?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWorse,\u201d Wednesday says grimly. \u201cBreakfast with my parents.\u201d\n--\nBreakfast takes place in the manor\u2019s dining room, which is less of a room and more of a grand hall that happens to have a polished oakwood table big enough for twenty people in its center. Enid can barely wrap her head around it all. To her, breakfast is a one-plate event that happens in a cramped and messy kitchen full of siblings and arguments. To the Addams family, it\u2019s a three-course affair that happens in a room five times the size of Enid\u2019s entire house.\u00a0\nMorticia sits at the head of the table, with Gomez to her right and Pugsley to her left. Wednesday sits next to her brother, and Enid remains standing, unsure if she should balance the table and sit next to Gomez or follow her instinct and sit next to Morticia.\u00a0\n\u201cHere,\u201d Wednesday says quietly, indicating the place next to her. A glint of yellow shines against the black of the cloth; unlike every other place at the table, the utensils at the plate next to Wednesday\u2019s are gold rather than silver.\u00a0\nWednesday set this place for her. The realization is a flower blooming in Enid\u2019s chest, and she has to fight down a wave of sudden emotion.\u00a0\nFood appears on the table in an endless stream of plates, all served by invisible hands. Enid widens her eyes at Wednesday in a  what is going on gesture and gets the usual unblinking stare in response.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, then,\u201d Enid says under her breath. \u201cThey have ghost servants. Totally normal and not at all weird.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSo,\u201d Morticia says, fixing her gaze on Enid. \u201cEnid, is it? Tell me about yourself. I would love to know more about the girl who has my daughter so infatuated.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid almost chokes on a piece of bacon at the word  infatuated. Next to her, the lines of Wednesday\u2019s body tense subtly. The movement would go unnoticed by anyone else, but Enid reads it like a page from her favorite book.\u00a0\n\u201cMother, please,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cYou embarrass me enough already; don\u2019t add to it by interrogating my girlfriend.\u201d\nWednesday\u2019s words fall over Enid like stars. It\u2019s the first time she\u2019s ever called Enid her girlfriend, and hearing it is enough to make Enid feel like she\u2019s downed a bottle of gasoline and dropped a lit match on her tongue.\u00a0\nGod, what\u2019s wrong with her? It\u2019s a fake relationship, not a marriage proposal. She doesn\u2019t even like Wednesday, not like that. She likes Wednesday in every way she\u2019s allowed to, and that\u2019s all. To ask for anything more would just be selfish.\u00a0\nMorticia continues talking, thankfully oblivious to the panicked state of Enid\u2019s inner monologue. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get to know her, dear. Something tells me she\u2019s going to be around for a long time, and I would like to be slightly more than a stranger to her.\u201d\nRather than fire back a caustic remark, Wednesday remains uncharacteristically silent. Enid looks over, surprised, and finds her methodically using two cheese knives to dissect a grape.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a look of fierce concentration on Wednesday\u2019s face that Enid knows better than the back of her own hand, the kind of intense focus that usually ends in violence. That\u2019s normal. What isn\u2019t normal is the faint stain of pink that paints the tops of Wednesday\u2019s cheekbones.\u00a0\nIs Wednesday  blushing?\u00a0 \n\u201cLook away,\u201d Wednesday murmurs without moving her mouth.  \u201cNow.\u201d\u00a0 \nEnid pulls her gaze away, but she can\u2019t stop a smile from spreading across her face. Even without looking, she can tell that Wednesday\u2019s scowl is growing.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d be happy to tell you more about myself, Mrs Addams,\u201d Enid says, \u201cif you\u2019ll tell me what Wednesday\u2019s been saying about me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d be glad to,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s mother says, \u201cbut darling, please. We\u2019re Morticia and Gomez - call me Tish, even.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, not doing that,\u201d Enid mumbles to herself. Then, louder: \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll tell you a little bit about me. I\u2019m a second-year student at Nevermore, I have three brothers, I\u2019m from San Francisco\u2026Um, I really like pink. The color, not the artist - I think Taylor Swift is probably my favorite artist, but Blackpink is up there too. I knit things, but I\u2019m still working on learning how to crochet, and\u2026that\u2019s all I can think of right now. I\u2019m a pretty unremarkable person, honestly.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNow, now, that\u2019s not the impression I\u2019ve gotten at all,\u201d Gomez says. He gives Enid a smile, his eyes bright with kindness. \u201cFrom what we\u2019ve heard from our little death trap, you are one of the brightest cactus flowers in the desert of her life.\u201d\nEnid turns to Wednesday, raising one eyebrow when their eyes meet. \u201cOne of the brightest flowers in your desert, huh?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBut of course,\u201d Wednesday replies. Her voice drops lower: quieter, more intimate. \u201cEnid, dearest, you are my North star. You are the only thing on this earth worth following.\u201d\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a gleam in Wednesday\u2019s eyes, one that says she knows the game they\u2019re playing and she wants Enid to know that the rules were penned by her hand and no one else\u2019s. Usually, Enid would rise to the challenge; right now, she\u2019s just trying to remember how to breathe properly.\u00a0\n\u201cAh,\u201d Gomez sighs. \u201cYoung love. Tish, don\u2019t they remind you of us at that age?\u201d\u00a0\nPugsley, who\u2019s been eating quietly for the duration of the meal, breaks his silence long enough to make a loud gagging noise and then goes back to refilling his plate.\u00a0\u00a0\nWednesday gives her mother a cold-eyed look of deep disgust. \u201cThat may be the most revolting sentiment I\u2019ve ever heard, and I\u2019ve been hearing the two of you exchange nausea-inducing drivel since I developed auditory processing abilities.\u201d\n\u201cSo, hey,\u201d Enid breaks in, only vaguely aware of what she\u2019s saying. \u201cWhen do you guys usually decorate for Christmas?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe already did.\u201d\nEnid looks left, then right, then left again. There\u2019s not a Christmas decoration in sight. \u201cYou did?\u201d\n\u201cThere,\u201d Morticia says, pointing toward the ceiling.\u00a0\nEnid squints around the room for a minute, finally catching sight of the small green wreaths hung above the door. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s ilex,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cCommonly known as holly, part of the family Aquifoliaceae.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHm,\u201d Enid says. \u201cYeah, no. That\u2019s not gonna cut it.\u201d\nWednesday frowns. \u201cThe leaves and berries contain toxins. It\u2019s the best holiday flora the forest has to offer.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe when it comes to being poisonous,\u201d Enid says, \u201cbut it\u2019s kind of lacking in the holiday spirit department. Come on, Wednesday, Christmas is in three days! Don\u2019t you want to decorate a little?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday scowls. Enid adjusts her inner wolf to inner kicked puppy sitting out in the rain and gives Wednesday the most pleading look she can.\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d Wednesday sighs. \u201cWhere do you propose we get these decorations?\u201d\nEnid grins. \u201cYou guys got a mall around here?\u201d\u00a0\n--\nThe stand-alone Target in town is much bigger than the mall outlets Enid is used to, but it\u2019s just the same on the inside. Enid skips happily through the aisles, inhaling the familiar smell of peppermint and fake balsam that always fills Target during the holiday season.\u00a0\nWednesday trails reluctantly behind, her usual black outfit a dark cloud against the bright red and white of the walls. \u201cThis store is an abomination.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Enid says, steering her into the holiday aisle. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about Target like that. This is the land of my people.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not the land,\u201d Wednesday says with distaste. \u201cThis is an insidious chain department store contributing to the epidemic of capitalism.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe  best chain department store,\u201d Enid corrects, \u201cwith the best Christmas decorations money can buy.\u201d She plucks two bundles of string lights from the shelf. \u201cYour house has outlets, right?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a refurbished Gothic mansion, not a cave.\u201d\n\u201cSo is that a yes, or\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGive me patience,\u201d Wednesday deadpans. \u201cYes, it has outlets.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, in that case,\u201d Enid says, sweeping the entire contents of the string lights section into her arms. Then, off Wednesday\u2019s unimpressed stare: \u201cWhat? It\u2019s a big house.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI resent being made a witness to your materialistic insanity,\u201d Wednesday declares. \u201cBut if you insist on doing this, you may as well do it right. Stay here.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nWednesday disappears around the end of the aisle. Enid waits right where she is, standing by the snow globe shelf with her arms full of tiny lightbulbs, and wonders where Wednesday\u2019s going.\u00a0\nShe doesn\u2019t have to wonder for long. Wednesday returns within two minutes, pushing a bright red shopping cart.\u00a0\nEnid lights up at the sight - no pun intended, she swears. \u201cYou got me a cart?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI did,\u201d Wednesday confirms. \u201cThe middle school girl who was using it became quite eager to give it up after I showed her the knives that I keep in my boots.\u201d\nEnid gives her a look.  \u201cWednesday.\u201d\u00a0 \nWednesday waves her hand dismissively. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. I didn\u2019t even unsheathe them.\u201d\n\u201cStill,\u201d Enid chastises. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go around showing knives to children.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOn my second birthday, Uncle Fester gave me a dagger and made sure I could accurately throw it through the heart of a mannequin by the end of the day. I turned out fine.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid drops her lights into the cart, shaking her head fondly. \u201cI give up.\u201d\n\u201cOn this travesty of a shopping trip? Good.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, on  you.  You\u2019re a Grinch. You\u2019re such a Grinch that you can\u2019t even understand why I\u2019m calling you a Grinch.\u201d Enid pushes the cart farther along the aisle, grabbing every Christmas-related item that catches her eye: tinsel, candy canes, snowman wrapping paper, an oversized snow globe that houses tiny ceramic reindeer grazing on a tiny ceramic tundra.\u00a0When they reach the end of the aisle, Enid takes a sharp right into the clothing section. \u201cI\u2019m never giving up on this shopping trip.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLamentably, you seem to be right about that.\u201d Wednesday pauses by a rack of reindeer onesies, clearly appalled. \u201cThese are hideous.\u201d\nEnid takes one and holds it up, considering. \u201cI think they\u2019re cute. Look, they even have little antlers. We could - \u201d\n\u201cIf you say \u2018we could match,\u2019 I will strangle you with your own Christmas lights.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday,\u201d Enid whines. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas. Can you find one thing in the holiday section that you at least don\u2019t hate?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday casts a dubious eye over the closest racks, which are mostly onesies and pajama sets bearing holiday puns in glittery red and green letters. \u201cNo. This establishment is a cultural wasteland.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nEnid lets out a heartfelt sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOf course I am,\u201d Wednesday says, like this is a given - and, well, maybe it is. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like me any other way.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s mouth is half-open around a denial, but it falls to pieces as she realizes just how much truth that statement contains. Wednesday is a monochrome portrait of individualism, a constant and contrary collection of complexities. She\u2019s both thorn and rose, one wrapped in the other; she\u2019s been a stone in the shoe of Enid\u2019s life since the very first day they met, and Enid wouldn\u2019t trade that for heaven or earth.\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Enid says, soft. Too soft. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nWednesday stays silent, and Enid wishes she could take the words back. They feel too much like a confession, like gospel from a religion Enid hasn\u2019t yet studied. She searches the sea of tacky holiday gear for a distraction - and, to her relief, finds one hanging from the edge of the bargain bin.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is  perfect,\u201d  Enid gasps, yanking the black Santa hat free of the  50% off - Clearance! sign that\u2019s stuck to its side. \u201cYou have to buy it. It\u2019s literally meant for you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFunny,\u201d Wednesday comments, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not some naive shopper who buys into the epidemic of capitalism for the sake of a holiday that has long since forgone religious significance for consumerist satisfaction, which is clearly the audience that this cheap, mass-produced item was meant to appeal to.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cJust try it on?\u201d Enid holds the hat out enticingly. \u201cIt\u2019s your favorite color and everything.\u201d\nWednesday heaves a long-suffering sigh and snatches the hat from Enid\u2019s hand before jamming it onto her head. It looks adorable on her, and Enid can\u2019t help but let out a little \u201cAw\u201d at the sight.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m taking a picture,\u201d she says, whipping out her phone and snapping a photo as she speaks, \u201cfor posterity.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIf you post that on any of your far too numerous social media accounts, I will disembowel you in your sleep.\u201d\n\u201cAw,\u201d Enid says again. \u201cSorry, you\u2019re just too cute in that hat. I can\u2019t take your death threats seriously.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday huffs, indignant. The Santa hat sits slightly crooked, cocked lower on one side than the other, and a few loose strands of her hair are escaping from beneath it.\u00a0\nIn this hat, with her usual braids, she looks years younger. Enid feels a strange ache at the thought, a deep and nostalgic wish that the two of them could have grown up together. She imagines, in the space between one breath and the next, an entire childhood shared like sunshine in summer, a version of herself that moved through the years with Wednesday at her side.\u00a0\nWednesday yanks the hat off again, and the illusion shatters; she\u2019s Enid\u2019s Wednesday again, looking irritated and static-haired and every one of her seventeen years.\u00a0\n\u201cHappy?\u201d Wednesday asks, sounding like she doesn\u2019t care if Enid never experiences joy again.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Enid flashes her phone at Wednesday, the screen open to her camera roll. \u201cI\u2019m going to frame this picture and hang it on my bedroom wall.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIf you were anyone else,\u201d Wednesday grumbles as they start walking again, \u201cyou\u2019d be dead right now.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid just grins. \u201cI know.\u201d\n--\nThey spend the afternoon hanging strings of soft white lights and silver tinsel all around the ground floor of the manor. Enid and Gomez do most of the work - Wednesday refuses to be involved, Gomez refuses to let Morticia lift a hand, and Pugsley\u2019s main contribution is sitting in a comfy chair and calling out directions - but Enid doesn\u2019t mind.\u00a0\n\u201cI must say, I\u2019m impressed,\u201d Gomez says as Enid lifts a table out of the way with one hand and plugs in a string of lights with the other. \u201cYour strength quite outweighs mine. In fact, I\u2019d go as far as to say that you\u2019re nearly as strong as Tish.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d Enid says, flattered at the comparison. Morticia Addams is one of the coolest women she\u2019s ever met; she\u2019s definitely better than Enid\u2019s own mother. \u201cIt\u2019s a werewolf thing. Hey, me being here for Christmas isn\u2019t a problem for you guys, right? I know I'm dating Wednesday, but I showed up on super short notice. I can totally go home again, if you want.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cCari\u00f1o,\u00a0no.\u201d Gomez sets down the armful of tinsel that he\u2019s carrying and rests a hand on Enid\u2019s shoulder. The touch is everything that Enid never receives in her own household: gentle, parental, reassuring. It\u2019s almost enough to make her cry.\u00a0\n\u201cListen to me,\u201d Gomez says. \u201cYou are always welcome here, Enid.  Always. Our door will never be closed to you, do you understand?\u00a0\nEnid nods slowly, overwhelmed by the kindness. \u201cYes, I think so, but why? I know I\u2019m - I\u2019m dating Wednesday, but you\u2019ve only just met me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe of the Addams family tend to love quickly and easily,\u201d Gomez says with a bashful shrug. \u201cJust look at me and Morticia. For us, it was love at first sight.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid casts her mind back to the first time she walked through the door of her dorm room to find Wednesday there, remembering the strange and instant magnetism that drew Enid toward her like a ship to harbor, and reflects that maybe, for them, it was much the same.\u00a0\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Gomez continues. \u201cYou saved my daughter\u2019s life. For that I will always be grateful.\u201d He correctly interprets the shock on Enid\u2019s face.  \u201cS\u00ed, claro. Wednesday made it very clear that without you, she would not be alive today.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d Enid says, sneaking a look at Wednesday now. She\u2019s sitting in a straight-backed leather chair, an oversized book spread open in her lap. \u201cWednesday doesn\u2019t usually need anyone\u2019s help.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t,\u201d Gomez agrees. \u201cBut she wants yours.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s heart leaps in her chest. \u201cYou really think so?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re together, aren\u2019t you?\u201d There\u2019s a merry sparkle in Gomez\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou make her very happy, Enid.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI can hear you, you know,\u201d Wednesday calls over to them, her gaze still fixed on the pages of her book. Her voice is so dangerously calm it sounds like a weapon.\u00a0\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Gomez says.  \u201cLo siento, mi diablo peque\u00f1a.\u201d He unspools another thread of tinsel and hands one end to Enid. Then he says, more quietly: \u201cStay as long as you would like, Enid. You are family now.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid nods, dazed. Gomez smiles at her and begins to loop tinsel over the frame of the door.\u00a0\nFamily, Enid thinks as she lets her gaze drift back to Wednesday like a magnet to steel. She could get used to the sound of that.\u00a0\n--\nThat night, dinner is served entirely on gold plates and eaten entirely with gold utensils - a gesture that leaves Enid deeply touched, even though it hadn\u2019t been entirely necessary.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she\u2019d tried to explain, \u201cif I\u2019m in the same room as silver, as long as I\u2019m not touching it. Really, I\u2019m fine. Wednesday already got me all the stuff I need.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense, dear,\u201d Morticia had answered. \u201cWe want you to be as safe and comfortable here as possible. Besides, we have to do  something with our golden cutlery other than melting it down for the alchemical process of reviving the dead.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd that had been the end of it. Now, back in Wednesday\u2019s room, Enid\u2019s still warm with the glow of the Addams family\u2019s approval.\u00a0\n\u201cDude,\u201d she says, flopping down in Wednesday\u2019s wooden desk chair. \u201cYour parents are the best.\u201d\nWednesday, stretched out on her bed, makes a skeptical sound from behind the pages of her book. \u201cI suppose they are occasionally above adequate parental figures.\u201d\n\u201cTrust me. Compared to  my  parents, yours are like\u2026I don\u2019t know, unicorns.\u201d Enid runs one finger lightly across the keys of Wednesday\u2019s typewriter. \u201cYour mom and dad - and Pugsley - have been nicer to me in two days than my family has in seventeen years.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday closes her book with a carefully controlled movement. \u201cYour parents are still treating you poorly, then.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Enid sighs. \u201cI thought I\u2019d caught a break when I finally wolfed out, but then I couldn\u2019t do it again the next full moon. They were all excited about it, expecting me to run with the pack, and I\u2026I couldn\u2019t.\u201d The shame burns hot in her mouth at the memory: the way she stretched her bones half-broken trying to shift a body that refused to change, the way pride slid from her mother\u2019s face like blood from an open wound.\u00a0\n\u201cI know they\u2019re your parents,\u201d Wednesday says after a minute, \u201cbut if you wish, I will see to it that neither of them ever see the moon rise again.\u201d\nThe threat is, once again, endearing where it once would have been concerning. Enid briefly considers that maybe this means she needs to do some self-reflection, and then decides against it. There\u2019s nothing wrong with appreciating your friend\u2019s loyalty, even if said loyalty is expressed in the form of promised violence against your enemies.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Enid says, a little reluctantly. \u201cThey\u2019ll come around someday, I guess. I hope. Annnnd\u2026that\u2019s enough about my angsty teenage struggle for acceptance. Let\u2019s change the subject.\u201d\u00a0\nThing, who\u2019s resting on top of the typewriter, taps a consoling message against the metal casing. Enid gives him a grateful smile. \u201cThanks, bud.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday doesn\u2019t say anything, and Enid\u2019s just starting to think she\u2019s fallen asleep when she sits up straight and asks, apropos of nothing: \u201cDo you have any of those lights left?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Enid says, confused at the non-sequitur but following Wednesday blind anyway. \u201cThey\u2019re colored ones, though.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHand them over.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid digs into the Target bag and tosses the coil of lights to Wednesday, who rises from the bed and catches them in one fluid motion. She unwinds them, tossing one end back to Enid. \u201cHelp me hang them up.\u201d\n\u201cWednesday,\u201d Enid says, uncomprehending. \u201cThey\u2019re colored.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cEnid,\u201d Wednesday replies, impatient. \u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s mouth abruptly closes as she recognizes this gift for what it is. She helps Wednesday adjust the lights until they form a circle around the room, draping down around the headboard of the bed and coming to rest by the foot of the desk. Thing takes the cord from Enid and plugs it into the outlet by the baseboard, then scurries back up onto the desk and poses smugly.\u00a0\nThe lights come to life, suffusing the room with soft color. Wednesday, standing by the window, is washed in shades of gentle pink. It\u2019s the first time Enid has ever seen her so colorful, and it\u2019s something like staring into the moon.\u00a0\n\u201cLook at that,\u201d Enid says. \u201cA little color\u2019s not so bad after all.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday purses her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s hideous. Don\u2019t get used to it.\u201d\u00a0\nThat\u2019s the thing, Enid thinks; she  can\u2019t  get used to this, but she wants to anyway.\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she says instead.\u00a0\nWednesday just glares at her. Somehow, it\u2019s still enough.\u00a0\nThey fall into bed together like they\u2019ve done it a hundred times before, heads touching and bodies angled away from each other to form the shape of a triangle. Enid\u2019s close enough to smell Wednesday\u2019s soap and hear her heartbeat, and it\u2019s dizzying. She wonders how she\u2019ll ever be able to go back to separate sides at Nevermore now that she knows how it feels to fall asleep by Wednesday\u2019s side.\u00a0\n\u201cEnid,\u201d Wednesday says, when they\u2019ve been lying in comfortable silence for a while. \u201cWhy did you and Ajax break up? I assumed the two of you would carry on your nauseating dalliance for a far longer period of time.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid gets the sensation, suddenly and definitely, that she\u2019s suffocating beneath the heat of the blankets. She shifts around, feeling the question work itself beneath her skin like a thorn.\u00a0\n\u201cWe just weren\u2019t good together,\u201d she says, and it\u2019s mostly true - there was never anything substantial between them. Ajax had liked her for whatever reason, and Enid had liked his eyes and his smile and the way he felt like the safest choice.\nIf Enid\u2019s being honest with herself, though, that\u2019s not all there is to it. She\u2019d known deep down that there was something wrong about the two of them. Every time she\u2019d seen him, her heart would beat the same predictable rhythm; every time she kissed him, it had been like playing out her role in the last scene of a clich\u00e9 teen movie. She could never quite shake the desire for a love that was something more than safe.\u00a0\n\u201cHe was never good enough for you,\u201d Wednesday says, an unexpected note of bitterness to her tone.\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Enid says, startled. She hadn\u2019t realized that Wednesday had any particular feelings about Ajax beyond a willingness to rip him apart if he hurt Enid. \u201cWhy - what makes you say that?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t see you,\u201d Wednesday replies. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even try.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid raises a hand to her mouth and bites at her thumbnail, conflicted. She had sometimes gotten the sense that Ajax didn\u2019t truly see her - and then there was the time he  literally didn\u2019t see her, when she\u2019d waited alone for hours and left in tears. Then again, Ajax had tried most of the time. Sort of.\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t really blame him for that,\u201d Enid sighs. \u201cHe\u2019s a boy, and boys are always dumb. He\u2019s still a person.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday makes a noise of disgust. \u201cBoys aren\u2019t people.\u201d\nEnid giggles, and Wednesday turns sideways to give her a deadpan look. \u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Enid turns too, until they\u2019re facing each other. \u201cIs that why it didn\u2019t work out with you and Tyler? Besides, you know, the fact that he turned out to be a shapeshifting, psychopathic murderer?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAs unlikely as it may sound, Tyler\u2019s status as a Hyde was the least of my issues with him,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cI was only ever using him for my own gain. He and I would never have worked.\u201d\u00a0\nThe moment seems to stretch out endlessly before them, poised like a diver in the split-second breath before impact. Enid breathes in, breathes out. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cAs a child,\u201d Wednesday begins slowly, \u201cI always believed myself to be above such embarrassing, insignificant matters as love. I did not believe myself capable of such a weakness, and I was glad of it; I told myself I would never waste my time in such a thankless manner, and I scorned those who would not agree.\u201d\nWednesday\u2019s eyes are like galaxies in this low light, reflecting a riot of color across the iridescent darkness of her irises. Enid watches, dazed and half-bewitched, as a beautiful new universe takes shape before her.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d she asks, barely above a whisper.\nWednesday\u2019s exhale is a tense, defensive thing. \u201cNow, if in some unlikely and far-fetched future I found myself capable of weakness, it would not be for someone like him. That was always wrong for me, and I think I\u2019ve known it from the start.\u201d\u00a0\nThere are a thousand questions piled up like boulders in Enid\u2019s throat, but before she can ask any of them, Wednesday rolls over abruptly onto her back.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite enough vulnerability for one night,\u201d she says. \u201cEnough for one lifetime, I think. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\nEnid waves goodnight to Thing, who waves back and clicks off the lights. The darkness descends around them quickly, sealing them into safety.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not swearing me to secrecy or death by gruesome murder,\u201d Enid whispers. \u201cAre you going soft on me, Addams?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHardly, and you insult me by insinuating that such a thing is possible.\u201d Wednesday shifts beneath the covers, and her leg brushes against Enid\u2019s for the barest hint of a second. \u201cI trust you, Enid. That is all.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday shuts her eyes like the matter is settled, like the conversation is a coffin she\u2019s lowering into the ground. Enid shuts her eyes too, lost in a way she\u2019s never been before.\u00a0\n--\nEnid wakes somewhere between midnight and dawn, drawn back to consciousness by some mysterious force. The room is still mostly dark; she can tell that moonrise was only a few hours ago. It\u2019s a waxing gibbous, nearly full, and Enid\u2019s stomach hurts briefly at the prospect of another full moon passing by without touching her.\u00a0\nNext to her, fast asleep, Wednesday sighs quietly and lets her head fall to one side of the pillow. Enid lets herself watch, feeling a little like she\u2019s stealing something. Wednesday\u2019s face is a study in light and shadow, so much like the fine art she loves that Enid doesn\u2019t understand, and her hair is messy in a way she would never tolerate if she were awake.\u00a0\nGuilt sweeps through Enid, along with a humbling realization that she\u2019s watching her best friend sleep like a total creeper, but she can\u2019t bring herself to look away. She so rarely gets to see this side of Wednesday.\u00a0\nLike this, asleep and peaceful, Wednesday is a portrait drawn in softer strokes. Enid thinks, not for the first or last time, that despite whatever else she may be, Wednesday Addams is beautiful. She\u2019s beautiful like fresh-carved marble, like midnight rain, and she has been ever since that very first day at Nevermore.\u00a0\nWednesday shifts, and the blankets slide down. Enid pulls them back up, covering her carefully. There\u2019s a warm, tender feeling in Enid\u2019s chest right now that steals her breaths and pulls at every piece of her, lighting her up from the inside out, and oh - she\u2019s never felt this before, not even with boys she\u2019s liked. Not even with Ajax.\u00a0\nNo, she corrects herself -  especially not with Ajax. This is the feeling she was missing with him; it\u2019s an overwhelming, all-consuming, how\u2019d-we-get-here-so-soon love that overflows in Enid like the ocean under a full moon, and it\u2019s all because of Wednesday.\u00a0\nOh.\u00a0\n \u201cOh,\u201d Enid whispers to herself, her blood turning to lava at the realization. \u201cOh, no.\u201d\n--\nEnid doesn\u2019t know how she falls asleep again after that, but the next thing she knows, she\u2019s being shaken awake by someone with cold hands.\u00a0\n\u201cGo away,\u201d Enid mumbles, closing her eyes tighter.\u00a0\nThe shaking stops abruptly. Seconds later, a pillow hits Enid in the head.\u00a0\n\u201cOw!\u201d Enid yelps, bursting out of bed and falling to the floor in an ungainly heap with the pillow over her face. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t responding to my gentler methods, and we have things to do.\u201d The pillow disappears to reveal Wednesday, fully dressed and standing over Enid\u2019s body with her arms crossed. \u201cYou\u2019re a surprisingly deep sleeper. Aren\u2019t werewolves supposed to be alert at all times?\u201d\n\u201cI was  tired,\u201d Enid huffs, picking herself up from the floor. \u201cAnd your gentler methods weren\u2019t gentle enough. Your hands are like blocks of ice.\u201d\n\u201cUnless you\u2019d like to find actual ice on your side of the bed tonight, I\u2019d stop talking so much,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cNow get dressed, and make sure your clothes are warm enough.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? What are we doing?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday flashes a rare hint of a smile - which is to say, the corner of her mouth twitches once before settling into its usual flat line. To anyone else, it would be imperfectible; to Enid, it\u2019s clear as day. It\u2019s nearly blinding, and Enid almost falls over again as she remembers, suddenly and clearly, the breakthrough she\u2019d had last night.\u00a0\nOh, no. No, no, no.\u00a0\nOkay, she tells herself; okay, calm down. This isn\u2019t that bad. There\u2019s no way she really has feelings for Wednesday. Last night\u2019s realization was a delusion, a simple mistake fueled by loneliness and sleep deprivation.\u00a0\n\u201cSince you shared one of your Christmas traditions yesterday, I thought I\u2019d return the favor,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cWe\u2019re going ice hunting. If you don\u2019t have a weapon, I\u2019ll get you one from the armory.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, no. They don\u2019t exactly let weapons through TSA.\u201d Enid rummages through her bag, pulling out her favorite fleece pants and a heavy pink flannel. \u201cWait, what\u2019s ice hunting?\u201d\n\u201cAn Addams tradition that occurs every year during the first snowfall,\u201d Wednesday replies. \u201cIt\u2019s reserved for family members only.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Enid says, understanding now - she\u2019s meant to be a spectator, nothing more. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fun to watch. Ooh, should I make some popcorn?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t be obtuse,\u201d Wednesday says shortly. \u201cYou\u2019re participating.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s head snaps up. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re participating,\u201d Wednesday repeats. \u201cEnid, like it or not, you are part of this family now. Get dressed and meet me downstairs; I\u2019ll get you a pair of skates.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s heart threatens to beat right out of her chest.  Part of this family. She\u2019s an Addams now.\u00a0\nWednesday widens her eyes at Enid, dark and impatient and breathtaking. Enid\u2019s stomach drops like a comet falling through the sky, and oh. Yeah.\u00a0\nShe absolutely has feelings for Wednesday.\u00a0\nWednesday, who\u2019s not a hugger. Wednesday, who\u2019s never worn a stitch of color. Wednesday, who\u2019s the bane of every society she\u2019s ever been part of.\u00a0\nWednesday, who is currently her fake girlfriend.\u00a0\nWell. This is going to suck.\nNo, Enid tells herself firmly. She can get through this. Question: WWWD? Answer: Wednesday, in the unlikely and earth-shattering event that she experienced some type of emotion, would take it to the grave and beyond.\u00a0\nDenial, then. Enid can handle that.\u00a0\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d she babbles. \u201cRight. Clothes. I own those. I\u2019m just going to - yeah. Right.\u201d She grabs an armful of clothes from her bag and sprints for the bathroom, and it\u2019s only once she\u2019s safely behind the door that Wednesday\u2019s words register in her mind. \u201cWait,  skates?\u201d \n--\nThe second Enid steps out of the house, she\u2019s shocked to see a thick blanket of snow painting the landscape a dazzling white. Everything is cleaner, quieter; it\u2019s like stepping onto a blank sheet of paper full of possibility.\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Enid says, scooping up a handful. It\u2019s cold against her skin, but she doesn\u2019t mind. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d\nPugsley looks up at her, frowning. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever seen snow before?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m from San Francisco,\u201d Enid reminds him. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky if we get a few snowflakes a year.\u201d\n\u201cWell, in that case\u2026\u201d Pugsley bends over and grabs a handful of snow, then rolls it into a snowball. \u201cWelcome to New England.\u201d\u00a0\nThe snowball smacks Enid in the face and explodes into powder. Enid sneezes once, twice, and then three times as the cold hits her. \u201cOkay,  rude.\u201d\u00a0 \nPugsley gives her a smug grin. Enid bends down to make her own snowball, but before she can throw it, Pugsley disappears beneath an avalanche of snow. His startled yell is quickly buried, along with the rest of him, until only the top of his hat is visible.\u00a0\n\u201cNo one tortures my girlfriend but me,\u201d Wednesday says calmly, wiping her hands clean. \u201cThat includes you, my benighted brother.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday steps closer, stretches out a hand, gently brushes a dusting of snow from where it\u2019s settled on Enid\u2019s collarbones. Enid feels the touch like a blizzard in her stomach.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Wednesday asks.\u00a0\nEnid does her best not to lean into Wednesday\u2019s touch. She only partly succeeds. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just snow. It was kind of exciting, actually. That was my first snowball fight ever.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTo call that a fight would be generous.\u201d Wednesday casts a glance at the pile of snow where Pugsley used to be. \u201cMy brother is never much use in a battle.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d the pile of snow protests. \u201cI am too. Sort of. Sometimes.\u201d\nThe doors of the manor fly open again and Gomez and Morticia step outside. Morticia is wearing an elegant set of furs; Gomez, on the other hand, is wearing what looks like a designer snowsuit. Enid holds back a giggle at the sight.\u00a0\n\u201cGood morning, my beautiful family,\u201d Gomez says. \u201cWho\u2019s ready for a little ice hunting?\u201d\nEnid raises her hand tentatively. \u201cYeah, about that? I still don\u2019t really know what it - \u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d Gomez declares, producing a pair of skates and a long pointed stick from behind his back and thrusting them at her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Wednesday told me exactly what you\u2019d need. You may keep these, of course; now that you\u2019re part of the family, you\u2019ll be needing them every year.  Dale!\u201d\u00a0 \nWithout another word, he and Morticia set off towards the lake. After a backward glance, Wednesday follows; Enid stays just long enough to pull Pugsley back onto his feet.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Pugsley says, shaking the snow from his hair. Then, sheepishly: \u201cSorry for throwing that snowball at you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Enid reassures him as they start walking to the lake. \u201cMy brothers have done way worse to me. One time when I was seven, they gave me a garbage bag and pushed me off the roof because they thought it would act like a parachute.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat sounds fun,\u201d Pugsley says with a shrug. \u201cWhen  I  was seven, Wednesday shut me in a chamber in the lab so she could test the efficiency of distilled cyanide gas. Hey, want to race to the lake?\u201d\n--\nIce hunting, as it turns out, involves skating around the lake and using a weapon of choice to demolish the various types of demons that appeared overnight along with the snow. So far Enid\u2019s seen hail gremlins, snow waifs, and chill-o-the-wisps, along with a few other creatures she doesn\u2019t recognize.\u00a0\nPugsley and Gomez are speeding around the lake together, racing in circles and laughing maniacally as they pile up the snowy carcasses. Morticia is skating in slower, more elegant laps and casually spearing snow demons on the tip of an ornate lance.\u00a0\nAs for Enid, she\u2019s just trying to move forward on her skates without face planting onto the ice.\u00a0\n\u201cEnid,\u201d Wednesday says, skating backwards past her while twirling a rapier casually at her side. Enid pointedly does not notice how attractive it is. \u201cAre you aware that skating requires movement?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Enid says indignantly. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet you remain motionless. I\u2019m fascinated to hear your rationale.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not good at ice skating, okay? I\u2019m from San Francisco. The only skating we do there happens on longboards.\u201d Enid inches one foot forward experimentally, then yelps as she nearly goes sprawling into a snowbank. \u201cAnd today is my first snow. Really, I\u2019ve made huge progress just by going outside today.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday shakes her head wordlessly, then sheathes her sword. \u201cGive me your hands.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s not moving anymore, but she still nearly falls over. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWitnessing your incompetence is actively causing me pain, and not the enjoyable kind, so I\u2019m going to help you.\u201d Wednesday holds out her hands, clothed in fingerless black gloves, and takes hold of Enid\u2019s. Her fingers are frigid against the warmth of Enid\u2019s palms; Enid shivers, but not from the cold.\u00a0\n\u201cThere,\u201d Wednesday says, slowly skating backwards. \u201cWhen I move, you move.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid slides tentatively forward, her grip closing tighter around Wednesday\u2019s fingers with every passing second. She\u2019s sure Wednesday\u2019s hands must be losing circulation, but she can\u2019t bring herself to let go. Without Wednesday, she\u2019ll surely fall.\u00a0\n\u201cLook up,\u201d Wednesday orders. \u201cYou can\u2019t make any progress if your eyes are on the ice.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid raises her eyes and immediately wishes she hadn\u2019t, because the sight of Wednesday before her is enough to ruin the rest of her life. Wednesday\u2019s cheeks are slightly pink from the winter air, and her braids have faint white snowflakes twining through them. Her hands are sure and steady, an anchor to Enid\u2019s unmoored ship - and Enid may still be standing, but she\u2019s already fallen.\u00a0\nDenial is so,  so not going to work out for her.\u00a0\n\u201cFollow my lead,\u201d Wednesday says, like Enid could ever do anything else. Wednesday glides slowly backwards; Enid forces herself to relax, despite every instinct that screams for her to brace for impact, and lets Wednesday guide her. Slowly but surely, they gain speed until they\u2019re soaring around the edge of the lake.\u00a0\nEnid raises her head, wonderstruck, as they pass beneath a low-hanging lattice of snow-whitened trees. \u201cThis is so cool. I guess skating\u2019s not that bad after all.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I said,\u201d Wednesday answers. \u201cWhen I move, you move.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s spoken simply, but to Enid it binds like an oath. When Wednesday moves, Enid moves; where Wednesday goes, Enid goes too.\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday! Enid!\u201d Gomez\u2019s cheerful voice echoes around the lake. \u201cOver here!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMy parents are watching,\u201d Wednesday murmurs as they skate closer. \u201cReady to try something new?\u201d\n\u201cUm, it depends what.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cJust trust me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI do,\u201d Enid says: automatic, no room for doubt. \u201cYou know I do.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cPrepare yourself, then.\u201d\n\u201cPrepare myself for what?\u201d Enid wants to asks, but she only manages to get out \u201cPre- \u201d before Wednesday\u2019s hands twist in her grip and the world spins before her eyes. Everything\u2019s a blur of black and white and cold, her vision filled with alternating flashes of ice and sky; adrenaline rushes through her system, bracing for a hard landing.\u00a0\nAnd then it\u2019s over and she\u2019s landing safely in Wednesday\u2019s arms, caught like a damsel in distress to Wednesday\u2019s gallant hero.\u00a0\n\u201cBravo,\u201d Gomez says, skating up to them and clapping politely. \u201cFabulous as always, Wednesday.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cImpressive,\u201d Morticia adds as she glides to a halt in front of them. \u201cWednesday, I did always say that you could have pursued figure skating.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFabulous is a relative term,\u201d Wednesday answers, releasing Enid, \u201cand you should know, Mother, that I would rather cut my feet off than waste all my days skating endless, miserable circles on ice like some kind of trained dog. Pugsley would be far better suited for that sort of thing.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d Pugsley pouts. \u201cI would not.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou would too.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s only half listening to the conversation, lost in the sensation of Wednesday\u2019s arms around her. They\u2019re not touching anymore, but Enid still feels Wednesday everywhere: her left hand beneath Enid\u2019s shoulders, her right hand resting at the small of Enid\u2019s back. Enid can already tell that she\u2019ll be dreaming about this for the next month, or maybe the rest of her life.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, this was another highly successful year of ice hunting,\u201d Gomez says.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a gruesome definition of success, but Enid can\u2019t exactly disagree; the ice is littered with corpses, and there are thin red trails of blood running like strings through the snow. It\u2019s rather morbid, and Enid blames Wednesday for the fact that this now seems nearly normal to her when once it would have sent her into a screaming spiral. \u201cShall we go inside and drink the mulled blood of our enemies?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Wednesday says quietly to Enid, somehow cataloguing the expression on her face without looking at her. \u201cI\u2019ll mix something sweet into yours.\u201d\nNow there\u2019s something to wonder about, Enid thinks as they start the journey back to the house; how Wednesday learned to read her like this, exactly where along the line the preservation of Enid\u2019s comfort became another one of Wednesday\u2019s meticulous habits.\u00a0\nEnid wants to ask so badly it makes her ache, but she can\u2019t. Here she is, as with so many questions in Wednesday\u2019s shape, at a loss for an answer.\u00a0\n--\nThe sitting room lies on the north side of the manor, with mullioned windows overlooking the lake. The stuff, formal furniture is carved from black wood, and the ceiling is high and drafty; in the corners, tall bookcases cast menacing shadows over the beast-skin rug. It\u2019s a thoroughly intimidating room that would creep Enid out if not for two things: the fire burning in the massive hearth, and Wednesday\u2019s presence next to her.\u00a0\n\u201cHere you are, dear,\u201d Morticia says, passing Enid a mug of dark, steaming liquid that smells like copper and cocoa. \u201cIt\u2019s an old family recipe.\u201d\nEnid shoots a tentative look at Wednesday, who gives her a slight nod. Trusting that Wednesday wouldn\u2019t let her be poisoned, Enid takes a sip.\u00a0\nWarmth floods her mouth, along with a taste that\u2019s salty and sweet at the same time. Enid swipes her tongue against her bottom lip thoughtfully, trying to decipher the exact flavors - there\u2019s the copper tang of blood, the rich earth of chocolate, and one more hint of spice that she can\u2019t recognize.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the traditional recipe,\u201d Wednesday says, speaking low enough that only Enid can hear. \u201cKnowing your inexplicable love for sugar, I added a frankly heinous amount of chocolate to yours.\u201d She pulls a face, like even the mention of sugar is disgusting to her. \u201cIf it\u2019s not to your liking, I\u2019ll inform the kitchen staff.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s incredible. Thanks.\u201d Enid licks her lips again, getting another subtle curl of spice. \u201cIs there something else in here, though? There\u2019s this one flavor I can\u2019t place, but it\u2019s really g- \u201d\u00a0\nShe breaks off abruptly, realizing that Wednesday\u2019s staring at her mouth. \u201cOh, crap. Is there chocolate on me? I know I\u2019m a messy drinker sometimes, my brothers are always making fun of me for it.\u201d She licks at her bottom lip again, self-consciously this time. \u201cJust tell me when I\u2019ve got it, okay?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDo you have to do that?\u201d Wednesday asks, in a tone that sounds unmistakably pissed off.\nEnid lowers her mug. \u201cDo what?\u201d\nWednesday glowers at her. \u201cNothing,\u201d she snaps, pulling her legs up onto the sofa and lying back until she\u2019s looking up at the ceiling rather than at Enid. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your concern.\u201d\nEnid swirls the contents of her mug around with one hand, confused and a little hurt. She has no idea what she\u2019s done, but she knows it must have been something for Wednesday\u2019s mood to shift so suddenly.\u00a0\nShe\u2019s just about to swallow her pride along with another mouthful of blood chocolate and ask what\u2019s wrong when Wednesday stretches out across the sofa to rest her legs across Enid\u2019s lap. The motion is casual, like this is routine for them rather than something that would have earned Enid a one-way grave-digging trip if she\u2019d ever suggested it back at Nevermore.\u00a0\nWednesday feels cold even through two layers of clothing. Enid rests one hand below her knee and takes it as a good sign when Wednesday doesn\u2019t cut her hand off for doing so.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d Enid murmurs, sneaking a glance at Wednesday\u2019s face. As usual, it\u2019s unreadable.\u00a0\n\u201cStop asking inane questions,\u201d Wednesday says, making no move to adjust her position. \u201cI hate being comfortable.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid just smiles, recognizing the approval for what it is, and leans back against the sofa\u2019s stiff cushions. Outside, a fresh flurry of snowflakes drifts slowly past the window.\u00a0\n--\nEnid wakes in a field, under an endless midnight-blue sky. There\u2019s nothing else in sight, no hills or houses for miles and miles. The only living thing in this landscape is her.\u00a0\n\u201cHello?\u201d she calls out, turning in a slow circle. There\u2019s an unsettling aura to this place, a sense of malice that settles bone-deep within her. Enid\u2019s claws spring out, ready for a fight, but there\u2019s only dead air and darkness.\u00a0\n\u201cEnid?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s voice. Enid whips around; Wednesday\u2019s standing there, but something\u2019s wrong. Her limbs are twisted and broken, and dark rivers of black are streaming from her eyes like tears the real Wednesday would never allow herself to shed.\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday,\u201d Enid gasps, stumbling towards her. \u201cWhat happened, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou did this,\u201d Wednesday says accusingly. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault. You\u2019re useless.\u201d\n Useless useless useless useless. The word echoes through the air, wrapping around Enid like a chain of sound and sending shivers through her body.\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Enid says desperately. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t me, Wednesday, I\u2019d never hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cYou did this,\u201d Wednesday repeats. She takes a step forward, grinning malevolently; the field starts to spin around Enid, faster and faster, and then Tyler\u2019s there in his Hyde form, looming over them and blotting out the stars, his mouth full of all the teeth in the world, and Wednesday\u2019s screaming in pain and there\u2019s so much blood everywhere -\u00a0\n\u201cEnid,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s voice booms, rolling like thunder. \u201cEnid!\u201d \n--\nEnid jolts awake violently, her heart beating so hard that her chest hurts. She gasps for breath, slowly taking in her surroundings - she\u2019s in bed, in Wednesday\u2019s room, and Wednesday\u2019s hovering over her with concern on her face.\u00a0\n\u201cYou were having a nightmare,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cI woke you up.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s limbs thrash in panic as she remembers what she saw: the field, the blood, Wednesday being torn apart. Her heartbeat jumps, racing like it\u2019s trying to reach safety.\u00a0\nA hand descends on her forehead, the touch cool against Enid\u2019s fear-flushed skin. Wednesday. Enid relaxes into it, letting herself inhale fully for the first time in minutes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d Wednesday says softly. \u201cJust breathe.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid breathes. Her heartbeat slows, settles. \u201cThanks. Sorry.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTyler,\u201d Enid says, her throat tight with the memory of it. \u201cAnd you. I couldn\u2019t save you.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s thumb strokes over Enid\u2019s temple, light and comforting despite the stilted uncertainty of the gesture. \u201cBut you did. Back at Nevermore, in the forest. You saved me.\u201d\nEnid\u2019s next inhale feels something like a knife to the lung. \u201cI know, but - but I haven\u2019t been able to shift since then, and maybe I never will again, and next time - \u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNext time,\u201d Wednesday interrupts, \u201cis a vague hypothetical. Think only of now.\u201d\nEnid focuses, narrows her horizons. Thinks only of now: Wednesday\u2019s bed, Wednesday\u2019s touch, all of Wednesday here and alive with her. Slowly but surely, her breaths come easier.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she murmurs after a long interval. \u201cI can do this. I\u2019m okay.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGood.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s hand slides from her forehead, and Enid finds herself instantly missing the contact.\u00a0 \u201cCan you sleep again?\u201d\n\u201cI think so, but\u2026\u201d Enid hesitates for a moment, then lets the words spill out before she can overthink them. \u201cCould we maybe, possibly\u2026cuddle? Just for a little bit?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday regards her in stony silence. Just when Enid\u2019s wishing that the bed would open up and swallow her whole, the other girl lets out a deep sigh and raises one arm to let Enid in.\u00a0\nEnid gratefully curls into the embrace, tucking her head into the space between Wednesday\u2019s head and shoulder and draping one arm over her stomach. Wednesday\u2019s hand comes to rest against her back, the touch gentle and grounding.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you tell anyone this happened,\u201d Wednesday warns, \u201cyou will be buried in an unmarked grave.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid hums in response. \u201cSounds good.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday makes an exasperated noise, then presses the side of her face to the top of Enid\u2019s head. \u201cGo to sleep, Enid.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid adjusts her position slightly, curling even closer into Wednesday; she\u2019s never had this chance before, and she\u2019ll probably never get it again, so she wants to make the most of it. Wednesday feels warmer than usual, her body solid and real against Enid\u2019s, and Enid wishes she could make this moment her home.\nIt strikes her, all at once, how strange this moment would have seemed only a few weeks ago. If someone had told Enid one month ago that she would be cuddling with Wednesday Addams before the end of the year, Enid would have laughed until her ribs started hurting.\u00a0\n\u201cYou used to hate it when anyone touched you,\u201d Enid observes. \u201cWhat changed?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not anyone,\u201d Wednesday says simply.\n\u201cAw, Wednesday! You  do  care about me.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday looks deeply affronted. \u201cI never said that. Now stop smiling.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Enid says, but her smile lingers. \u201cHey -\u00a0 can you talk to me for a minute? Say anything, recite depressing poetry, I don\u2019t care. I just need some kind of reassurance that you\u2019re really alive.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat a horribly morbid sentiment,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cI adore it.\u201d She clears her throat quietly, takes a deep breath, and begins to speak in a hushed, somber voice.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was many and many a year ago - in a kingdom by the sea - that a maiden there lived whom you may know - by the name of Annabel Lee; and this maiden she lived with no other thought - than to love and be loved by me.\u201d\u00a0\nThe words wash over Enid like waves against the shore, a slow-receding lull that pulls her towards sleep. Her eyes fall closed despite her best efforts, her breaths growing slower as Wednesday continues.\u00a0\n \u201cI  was a child and  she  was a child - in this kingdom by the sea - but we loved with a love that was more than love - I and my Annabel Lee - with a love that the wing\u00e8d seraphs of Heaven - coveted her and me.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid slips unwillingly beneath the surface of consciousness, clinging to the ends of Wednesday\u2019s sentences. Her last thought, drenched in sleep and poetry, is that she\u2019d like to have an Annabel Lee kind of love with Wednesday.\u00a0\nShe wakes up in Wednesday\u2019s arms the next morning, warm and safe and whole, and it feels like a kingdom by the sea.\u00a0\n--\nThe day of Christmas Eve is one that Enid usually spends fighting with her brothers, drinking too much hot chocolate, and driving around neighborhoods in search of fancy Christmas light displays. This year, however, she\u2019s spending it wandering the halls of a haunted mansion.\u00a0\nSurprisingly, it still feels like home. Enid doesn\u2019t need to wonder whether it\u2019s because of the girl at her side.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd  this,\u201d Wednesday says, flinging open yet another ten-meter-tall arched door, \u201cis the billiard room. It was built by Drusilla Addams and recently refurbished by my Uncle Fester, whose addiction to gambling on his billiard games has cost him ten thousand dollars, two marriages, and his right eyeball.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHe gambled one of his  eyes?\u201d\u00a0 \n\u201cBelieve it or not, he\u2019s gambled far worse than that.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSheesh.\u201d Enid runs her hand along the smooth black side of the billiard table, noting the velvet inlay - black, of course - and then plucks a cue stick from a wicker basket. \u201cThat\u2019s rough.\u201d\n\u201cUncle Fester\u2019s always been a character.\u201d Wednesday picks up a cue stick of her own, spins it deftly between her fingers. \u201cHe\u2019s the family disappointment.\u201d\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Enid mumbles, feeling a sudden sense of kinship with Uncle Fester. \u201cHe\u2019s just like me for real.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of my favorite people in this dreary world,\u201d Wednesday remarks, \u201cso in that regard, I suppose you are similar to him. It\u2019s a shame you can\u2019t meet him; he was supposed to visit for Christmas, but he\u2019s landed himself in a mental asylum yet again.\u201d\nShe lines up the cue stick and sinks a clean shot in the corner pocket. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve been to the billiard room, the attic, the wine cellar, the east wing, and the west wing, is there anything else you want to see? The torture chamber is my personal recommendation; the racks were just replaced last year.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou have a torture chamber? Never mind, don\u2019t tell me. I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d Enid leans against the table, deliberating. \u201cAs much as I like walking through a life-size version of the  Clue mansion, I think I\u2019m ready to wrap it up soon. There\u2019s just one more place I\u2019d like to see.\u201d\nWednesday collects the billiard balls and places them in the rack, then holds her hand out for Enid\u2019s cue stick. \u201cDo tell.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI want to see your favorite room.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday looks perplexed. \u201cI already told you. It\u2019s the torture chamber.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d Enid allows. \u201cYour favorite room the house that  isn\u2019t the torture chamber.\u201d She catches the devious quirk of Wednesday\u2019s eyebrows. \u201cOr the dungeon.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSometimes I wonder how you find any enjoyment in life,\u201d Wednesday comments. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll show you my third favorite room of the manor. You should be warned, however, that it will be three times less exciting than the torture chamber would have been.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay with me,\u201d Enid says as they leave the billiard room. \u201cNot everything has to be a great big adventure. Sometimes it\u2019s enough to just be there.\u201d\u00a0\n--\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d Wednesday announces, stopping in front of a tall door with iron hinges and large glass windows. \u201cThe Addams family greenhouse, home to the largest private collection of rare and toxic plants in the Northern Hemisphere.\u201d\u00a0\nThe air in the greenhouse is still and heavy, warm like the sky after midsummer rain. Enid lifts her head to the faraway ceiling, inhaling deeply: everything smells sweet and green and alive, a hundred different scents combining in a heady rush.\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t inhale deeply near the plants on the left side,\u201d Wednesday cautions. \u201cSome of them have airborne toxins in the leaves.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid stops inhaling. \u201cAirborne toxins? Is it safe to be in here?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cQuite safe. Every poison in this greenhouse also has an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cMy preferred antidote to poison is not being poisoned in the first place,\u201d Enid mutters, but she follows Wednesday deeper into the greenhouse anyway.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s like walking through a forest; a thousand plants stretch toward the ceiling, vines and leaves unfurling in every direction. Flowers bloom among the greenery in explosions of color: scarlet reds, cobalt blues, royal purples. Everywhere Enid looks, she sees something new.\u00a0\n\u201cThis greenhouse is my mother\u2019s pet project,\u201d Wednesday says as they pass a row of virulent orange flowers shaped like trumpets. \u201cShe\u2019s spent years collecting poisonous and carnivorous plants. It\u2019s by far the most interesting of her life\u2019s few accomplishments.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid reads between the lines, finds the grudging pride in Wednesday\u2019s tone. \u201cYour mom is a badass,\u201d she agrees. \u201cEven though it\u2019s low key making me fear for my life, this place is awesome.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly better than Nevermore\u2019s collection,\u201d Wednesday concedes. She gestures at a spiky plant to their right, which has foot-long spines jutting from its dark green leaves. \u201cFor example, ours is the only greenhouse in New England to have a Serbian Sawtooth cactus.\u201d\u00a0\nDespite the heat and color, Wednesday looks perfectly comfortable in the greenhouse. She fits here, like this: the blackness in the blossoms, the deadliest thing in a room full of deadly things. In this endless sea of flowers, Enid would still pick her.\u00a0\n\u201cLook around on your own for a few minutes,\u201d Wednesday says as they reach the end of the aisle. \u201cI have something to show you, but it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cUm, okay, but if I get eaten by a toxic plant and die then I\u2019m totally coming back to haunt you.\u201d Enid starts off in the opposite direction from Wednesday, past a grove of trees with weeping branches that sweep the ground with purple flowers.\u00a0\nOn her own, walking through the greenhouse feels like being lost in a forest. Enid turns left and right and left again, her eyes darting ceaselessly from side to side - partly so she doesn\u2019t miss anything, partly so she\u2019ll see it coming if any of the plants decide to attack her.\u00a0\nAfter a few minutes, she emerges from the maze of plants to find that there\u2019s a rock pool in the corner of the greenhouse, fed by a small waterfall that spills gently from somewhere behind a pile of mossy rocks. The bottom of the pool is a volcanic black, and small green lily pads drift aimlessly on the crystal-clear water.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a refuge from the relentless crush of color, and Enid gratefully steps closer to the edge of the pool. She looks down at her reflection, pale and distorted by lily pads, wondering if the water is poisonous too.\u00a0\n\u201cI see you\u2019ve found the greenhouse.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid manages to avoid falling into the pool, although it\u2019s a near miss. She jumps back from the edge, limbs flailing, and bites back a curse.\u00a0\nMorticia Addams is standing there, holding a watering can in one hand and a pair of wicked iron shears in the other. For a split second, Enid has the wild thought that maybe she\u2019s about to be murdered by Wednesday\u2019s mother - and then Morticia sets down the shears, and the fear passes.\u00a0\nEnid straightens her posture and tries to pull herself together. \u201cHi! Yeah, Wednesday brought me in here. It\u2019s her third favorite room in the house, apparently.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHigh praise, coming from her.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cShe said it\u2019s one of your biggest accomplishments,\u201d Enid offers, paraphrasing a little for the sake of peace.\u00a0\n\u201cKnowing her, she conveyed that in a far more derogatory way,\u201d Morticia sighs. \u201cStill, I suppose it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d\n\u201cOh no, Wednesday\u2019s a softie at heart,\u201d Enid assures her. \u201cShe just can\u2019t admit it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday and I have never had an easy relationship.\u201d Morticia bends down, trails a hand through the water of the pool. \u201cShe abhors the comparison, but she reminds me so much of myself at the same age; perhaps it is that very same similarity that stands like a barrier between us. She has always gotten on better with her father.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not true,\u201d Enid hurries to say. \u201cSeriously, Wednesday respects you so much. Every time she talks about you, I can tell.\u201d\nThe ghost of a smile traces the corner of Morticia\u2019s mouth, there and then instantly gone again. \u201cShe has had such little happiness in her life, you know. But you, Enid - you make her happy, no matter how much she\u2019d like to hide it. I am glad that you have such a special place in her heart. I was worried about her returning to Nevermore semester, but I feel better now that I know she has you.\u201d\u00a0\nA thread of guilt pulls tight in Enid\u2019s chest, an unwelcome reminder of the lie they\u2019ve been weaving all this time. \u201cR- right. Thanks.\u201d\n\u201cEnid?\u201d Wednesday calls out from somewhere deep in the greenhouse.\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to her,\u201d Morticia says, gathering her shears. \u201cAnd again, Enid. Thank you.\u201d\u00a0\nMorticia vanishes out a side door. Enid follows the sound of Wednesday\u2019s voice, her head still spinning from their conversation.\u00a0\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s waiting by a grove of pomegranate trees, something small and pink cupped in her hands. Enid\u2019s eyebrows rise curiously. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHere,\u201d Wednesday says, holding it out. \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid takes it. It\u2019s a small ceramic pot that holds a thin, dawn-pink flower with a trumpet-shaped stem and five triangular petals blooming at its top. The flower is beautiful and delicate and alive with color, and it's everything Wednesday should hate, but Enid knows from the way she handled it that it\u2019s something precious to her.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Enid says, her voice hushed for some reason. \u201cWhat kind of flower is it?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cA nerium moonflower,\u201d Wednesday explains. \u201cA crossbreed of the regular moonflower and the highly poisonous pink oleander, which takes the shape of the former and the hue of the latter. I thought you\u2019d like it.\u201d\n Moonflower.  The significance isn\u2019t lost on Enid; she ducks her head to hide the heat rising in her cheeks, suddenly and mortifyingly close to tears.\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to take it,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cI can replace it with a harmless flower if you\u2019d like.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid cradles the flower to her chest. \u201cNo, I\u2026I love it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat is\u2026pleasing news.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s gaze, usually so steady and unblinking, flicks away from Enid\u2019s for a moment. \u201cWell, that concludes the tour.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid looks at Wednesday, and Wednesday looks back at her. Their eyes meet like flowers blossoming simultaneously - and they may be standing in the middle of a garden of death, but Enid\u2019s never felt this alive in her life.\u00a0\nThe guilt from earlier rises in Enid\u2019s throat, and she swallows it down again. She can\u2019t give this up. She won\u2019t. One more week and it\u2019ll all be over, anyway; she won\u2019t let go of a single moment before it\u2019s time.\u00a0\n--\nThey go out that night, and somehow it\u2019s all because of Pugsley; well, there\u2019s no wingman quite like the twelve year old brother of the girl you\u2019re pretending to date and secretly in love with. It starts with one simple comment, and the rest is a forgone conclusion.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re staying in  again?\u201d Pugsley says later that evening, throwing a disbelieving look at the couch where Enid and Wednesday are sitting together. \u201cYou guys are so lame. Don\u2019t you ever go on dates? God, even Mom and Dad have a better love life than you.\u201d\u00a0\nThat\u2019s how Enid finds herself where she is now: behind the wheel of Gomez\u2019s black vintage Mercedes, heading into town with Wednesday riding shotgun.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is  so cool,\u201d Enid marvels, barely resisting the urge to open her window and hang one arm outside as she drives. She wonders if there\u2019s a pair of sunglasses in the glove compartment. \u201cI can\u2019t believe your dad let me take this car. I\u2019ve only had my license for like, six months.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it either. He just likes you, for whatever reason.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTotally runs in the family, then,\u201d Enid jokes, looking over as the car rolls to a stop before a red light.\u00a0\n\u201cKeep your eyes on the road,\u201d Wednesday instructs. Then, quieter: \u201cI suppose that conclusion is not entirely incorrect.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid tries to hide her grin, but she\u2019s not entirely successful.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re getting into town now, rolling through streetlights and passing by businesses illuminated by strings of golden lights: bookstores, coffee shops. Everything is warm-lit and cozy, so small-town Christmas it could bring a tear to Enid\u2019s city-girl eye.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I meant to ask earlier,\u201d Enid says as they drive by a shabby little building with a burnt-out neon sign that reads  PSYCHIC - TAROT - DIVINING blinking apathetically in the window. \u201cHave you been having any more visions?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wednesday replies shortly. \u201cThe last one was weeks ago, and it showed me a scenario that seemed quite unlikely. Since then, I\u2019ve been free of them.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOoh, what kind of scenario?\u201d\n\u201cOne that will never come to pass.\u201d Wednesday folds her arms across her chest, scowling. \u201cMore important, one that\u2019s none of your business. My visions are my own.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Enid says, drawing the word out slowly, \u201cbut maybe you could see  my future! Here, touch my hand.\u201d She takes one hand off the wheel, extending it into the space between them.\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s tone is exasperated. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works, Enid. I\u2019m not a crystal ball; I can\u2019t just take your hand and magically see what will happen to you an hour or a week from now.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, you could try.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThis is a waste of time,\u201d Wednesday mutters, but she places her hand flat in Enid\u2019s palm anyway. \u201cGoody told me that my visions were incomplete and unreliable, anyway. It\u2019s not as I\u2019ll be able to see any-  ohhhh.\u201d\u00a0 \nWednesday\u2019s head jerks back, her body stiffening and her eyes glazing over as the vision overwhelms her. Enid nearly swerves the car through a red light at the intersection, Wednesday\u2019s hand in hers the only thing that keeps her steady.\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday! Are you okay?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday snaps back into her body and pulls her hand away from Enid\u2019s, looking disgruntled. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid raises her eyebrows, excited. \u201cWell? Did it work?\u201d\n\u201cSomehow,\u201d Wednesday says, \u201cyes. I would advise you to avoid ordering the steak tartare tonight; the vision wasn\u2019t entirely clear, but I saw you looking like a plague victim on my bathroom floor. I find the Black Death as intriguing as anyone, but some things are too disgusting even by my standards.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid bids a wistful goodbye to the dinner she\u2019d been planning to order. \u201cEighty-six the steak. Got it.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nThe light turns green, and she steps on the gas pedal. After a moment, Wednesday\u2019s hand falls away from hers.\u00a0\n--\nThe restaurant is on the east side of town, overlooking the ocean. Enid parks neatly between a BMW and a Bentley - \u201cneatly\u201d meaning that she only has to back out and readjust twice - then gets out and hurries around to Wednesday\u2019s side to open her door.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t need your ridiculous attempts at chivalry,\u201d Wednesday scoffs, but she lets Enid close the door behind her too.\u00a0\nInside, the restaurant is classy but charming; soft yellow lights hang from the ceiling, and white-clothed tables sit in neat rows. It\u2019s crowded, almost impossibly so - Enid can\u2019t see a single empty table in the place. She thinks, belatedly, that they probably should have made a reservation.\u00a0\nThe hostess looks up as they enter. \u201cHow can I help you tonight?\u201d\n\u201cA table for two, please,\u201d Wednesday says.\u00a0\nThe hostess flicks through her register, frowning. \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any openings for tonight. We have a lot of reservations\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d Wednesday observes, staring the hostess dead in the eye. There\u2019s nothing intentionally menacing about it; Enid\u2019s seen Wednesday\u2019s menacing face, and that\u2019s a thousand times scarier. It is, however, enough to make the hostess look very nervous.\u00a0\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d The hostess scans her register again. \u201cI think we can make something work. Right this way, please.\u201d She takes two menus from the stand and hurries into the dining area, beckoning for them to follow.\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday,\u201d Enid scolds quietly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just intimidate people into doing things for you.\u201d\nWednesday shrugs. \u201cI see no issue.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re impossible.\u201d\n\u201cFar better than being possible.\u201d\n\u201cHere you are, ladies,\u201d the hostess says, setting the menus down on a two-person table right next to the window. \u201cEnjoy, and have a wonderful Christmas Eve.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSee,\u201d Wednesday says the instant she\u2019s gone. \u201cIntimidation yields results.\u201d\n\u201cFine, maybe you\u2019re right,\u201d Enid admits, \u201cbut still. She was nice, and now she\u2019s terrified.\u201d\n\u201cAgain, I see no issue.\u201d Wednesday takes off her coat and hangs it from the back of her chair, effectively ending the conversation. Tonight she\u2019s wearing a black knit vest over a white button down, the sleeves rolled back at the elbow, and her hair is hanging in its customary braids. It\u2019s a variation on her style that Enid\u2019s rarely seen before, two steps to the left of where she usually stands with regards to fashion, and it\u2019s stunning. Now that she\u2019s not focused on driving, Enid\u2019s having trouble remembering how to function.\u00a0\nShe looks down at the table for a distraction, noticing that the baby blue napkins are folded to look like cravats. \u201cWhoa, check out these fancy napkins.\u201d  And please don\u2019t notice how hard I\u2019m trying not to stare at you.\u00a0 \nWednesday glances at her own napkin, scoffs, and plucks it from the table. Her hands move in a flurry too fast to follow, and then she places the refolded napkin in front of Enid; it\u2019s now in the shape of a crane, far more elaborate and realistic than the cravat had been. \u201cThere. Now you have a piece of napkin origami actually worth being impressed by.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d Enid says in amazement, touching one finger gently to the crane\u2019s tail. \u201cOMG, wait. I  have to post this. Hold on.\u201d She pulls her phone from her pocket, swiping away a flood of notifications that remind her just how little she\u2019s been online for the last few days, and opens the camera app. \u201cOkay, smile.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday does not smile. \u201cWhy are you taking a picture of me?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTo post on Instagram, duh! You want to sell our relationship, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTo my parents, yes. Not to half of Nevermore\u2019s student body.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cPugsley will see it,\u201d Enid reminds her. \u201cThat counts, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday lets out a long-suffering sigh. \u201cI\u2019m not smiling.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTypical,\u201d Enid says fondly as she sets up the shot, making sure to perfectly center Wednesday, then snaps the photo. \u201cThere. Perfect. I\u2019m posting it right away.\u201d\n\u201cI despise you,\u201d Wednesday mutters, taking a sip of water.\u00a0\nEnid opens Instagram and selects the photo, quickly adding a caption before hitting the post button. She watches it upload, and there it is: proof of her and Wednesday, in living color.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nenid.sinclair all i want for christmas (eve) is you #datenight #girlfriendreveal\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe picture shows Wednesday staring directly into the camera, one hand resting on the knife by the side of her placemat. She looks equal parts bored, irritated, and breathtaking; Enid can\u2019t imagine a more accurate portrayal.\u00a0\n\u201cThere, look,\u201d she says, spinning the phone around and sliding it over to Wednesday. \u201cOur hard launch is complete.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI have no idea what that idiotic phrase means, and I don\u2019t wish to.\u201d Wednesday peers at the screen warily. \u201cWhat are all these  replies?\u201d \n\u201cAlready?\u201d Enid takes the phone back, curious. Wednesday was right; her comment section is blowing up.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014 biancabarclayofficial so u two finally got together? about damn time\u00a0\n\u2014 xavierdraws is this some kind of joke lol\u00a0\n\u2014 biancabarclayofficial @xavierdraws true love is not a joke tf? glad i dumped ur ass\u00a0\n\u2014 eugene_otinger_likes_bees OMG??? wednesday when you finally answer one of my calls you will never hear the end of this also omg you guys are so cute i\u2019ll send you some honey jars\u00a0\n\u2014 snakemasterajax wait what\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey  all know,\u201d Wednesday says, in tones of deep disgust. \u201cYou\u2019re dead to me.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s finger hovers over the screen. \u201cDo you want me to delete it?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo\u201d Wednesday says immediately. \u201cLeave it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHa!\u201d Enid exclaims, pointing an accusing finger at her. \u201cSo you  do like it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt will contribute to our deception,\u201d Wednesday says primly, flipping open her menu. \u201cNothing more, nothing less.\u201d\nEnid opens her menu too, holding it in front of her face to hide her smile.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd stop smiling,\u201d Wednesday says, not in the least deceived. \u201cIt\u2019s ruining my appetite.\u201d\u00a0\n--\nThe night goes on, minutes slipping slowly into hours. Plates lie scattered across the table between them, bearing the remains of their dinner: the seared swordfish for Wednesday, the grilled chicken for Enid, who decided to steer clear of all steak products after Wednesday\u2019s vision, and a platter of roasted brussels sprouts they shared after Wednesday\u2019s abject refusal to try the deep-fried mac and cheese bites.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s nearly ten o\u2019clock and quieter now, the earlier clamor of the restaurant dimmed to a sleepy murmur. A candle burns on the table between Enid and Wednesday, placed there by an apologetic waiter halfway through their meal; Wednesday\u2019s been swiping her index finger through the flame for the last few minutes, pulling away more slowly every time.\u00a0\nTheir table has been silent for the last few minutes, but the silence isn\u2019t uncomfortable; it feels like they\u2019re back in their room at Nevermore, existing separately but together. Enid\u2019s content to simply sit across from Wednesday and watch as she plays with fire in a way that would earn her the title of pyromaniac from anyone else. For Enid, this is just typical Wednesday behavior.\u00a0\n\u201cThis meal has been\u2026not entirely unpleasant,\u201d Wednesday says at last, folding her hands in front of her. \u201cThe food was sufficiently edible.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt was nice,\u201d Enid agrees. \u201cA lot less chaotic than Christmas Eve with my family, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHave you talked to your family at all since you\u2019ve been here?\u201d Wednesday asks bluntly.\u00a0\nEnid shrugs. There\u2019s been a few points of contact - a series of scattered texts, and a brief call from her mother earlier this morning where she managed to casually criticize four different things about Enid in the span of three minutes before wishing her a merry Christmas Eve and hanging up - but nothing more than that.\u00a0\n\u201cNot really, but honestly, that\u2019s fine with me. They\u2019d just find a way to twist it into another conversation about sending me to lycanthropy conversion camp next summer, like I haven\u2019t told them a hundred times that I\u2019m  never going to a place like that. Like, I won\u2019t even get to open my presents until I get home, but I\u2019m pretty sure my mom wrapped my Christmas presents in camp brochures.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid heaves a sigh, then forces out the worry that\u2019s been eating at her like a starving dog for the last six weeks. \u201cThe worst part is, sometimes I have to wonder if they\u2019re right. Maybe there  is something wrong with me, you know? Maybe I\u2019m defective - and maybe, now that I can\u2019t wolf out, I\u2019ll never find a mate.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wednesday says, instantly dismissive. \u201cYou may have a myriad of other issues, but this is not one of them.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid squares her shoulders, feeling a sudden ache in her ribs. \u201cI want to hate them for it, sometimes, but I can\u2019t. They\u2019re my family.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFamily isn\u2019t everything,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cAnd you deserve better than that kind of treatment.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid looks up, across the table, and their eyes meet. Wednesday\u2019s gaze is darkly intense as always, and there\u2019s an extra weight to it now that makes Enid\u2019s knees go weak.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Enid mumbles. Then, before she can say something more embarrassing, she adds: \u201cAnd by the way, I do not have a myriad of other issues.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cReally,\u201d Wednesday says flatly. \u201cWhat about your obsession with saccharine, overproduced noise masquerading as music?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with my music. And for the record, my playlists are amazing.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThen shall we discuss your eye-injuring choices of clothing?\u201d\n\u201cBetter than looking like a funeral home director every day of my life,\u201d Enid huffs.\u00a0\nWednesday leans forward slightly, like she\u2019s ready for battle. Recognizing the challenge, Enid leans in too.\u00a0\n\u201cYou have an extra social media account,\u201d Wednesday says, \u201cspecifically for your stuffed animals, of which you have far too many.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou own a  gramophone. Even my grandmother doesn\u2019t have one of those.\u201d\n\u201cYou talk in your sleep.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you sleep like a dead person! I had to check your pulse when I woke up this morning just to make sure you didn\u2019t pass away during the night.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday snorts. \u201cIf only I had. It would have spared me from waking up to find pink fuzz all over my blankets from your ridiculous fleece pajamas.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s heart leaps in her chest, like it's following their words as they fly back and forth across the table. There\u2019s a lingering undertone to this conversation, a softer echo of a former fight; it looks like an argument, but lands like affection. It\u2019s light and familiar, and to Enid it feels dangerously comfortable - she could live like this forever and still not get tired of it.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Enid says belatedly, fumbling for an insult that will flatten the emotions rising in her chest. \u201cWell, you - your house doesn\u2019t even have a Christmas tree.\u201d\nShe says it scathingly - like it\u2019s the world\u2019s worst crime, because at this time of the year it  is - but something about it must fall flat, because Wednesday narrows her eyes in that way she only does when she\u2019s trying to uncover a truth.\u00a0\n\u201cYou want a Christmas tree, then,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cIs that traditional for your family?\u201d\nEnid thinks of the place she grew up, of the faded yellow walls of her living room and the many Christmas trees they\u2019ve housed over the years: the living pine, the tinsel shrub, the evergreen destroyed by her brothers one Christmas morning as they fought each other over the new Playstation. Unexpectedly, a wave of wistfulness washes over her.\u00a0\n\u201cI - yeah, it is. We\u2019ve always had a tree in the living room, and decorating it together is always the one time our house is peaceful. Never lasts, of course, but it\u2019s nice while it does.\u201d\nWednesday nods once, sharply, then signals for the bill; their waiter comes over immediately and slides it onto the table.\nEnid pulls out her wallet, digging in the side pocket for the credit card her father gave her for emergencies last year. (She\u2019s since learned the hard way that a ten-foot-tall Djungelskog from IKEA doesn\u2019t qualify as an emergency purchase.) \u201cHere, I got it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. Our family has more than sufficient funds.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I can pay.\u201d Enid gently pries the bill from Wednesday\u2019s hands, then slots her card into the top. \u201cYou\u2019ve done enough for me already, and it\u2019s not even really my money - my dad gave me this credit card.\u201d She laughs bitterly. \u201cPretty much the only thing he\u2019s ever given me.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday tilts her head to the side, considering.\u00a0\n\u201cPlus,\u201d Enid adds with a wink. \u201cI\u2019m your girlfriend, right? I\u2019m supposed to treat you.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday opens her mouth, glares, closes it again. \u201cFine.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are you in such a rush, anyway?\u201d Enid asks as the waiter hands her the receipt. \u201cWhere do we have to be?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe Christmas tree farm,\u201d Wednesday says, like this is a given. \u201cThey\u2019re closed at this time of night, but their security is laughable. We should be in and out quite quickly.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s jaw drops. \u201cCall me Santa in denial, cause I\u2019m saying ho ho  no  to that. It\u2019s so against the holiday spirit, Wednesday. We can\u2019t steal a Christmas tree!\u201d\n--\nThey do, in fact, steal a Christmas tree.\u00a0\nWednesday is right; security at the farm is lax at best, and it takes her a mere five minutes to pick the lock on the gate, select a tree, and drag it back to the car. Enid helps her lift it onto the roof and secure it, feeling a little like the Grinch.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m literally stealing Christmas,\u201d she frets as they pull out of the lot. \u201cWell, one Christmas tree, but still. This has to be some kind of seriously bad karma.\u201d\n\u201cKarma is an incorrect notion made up to dissuade people from immorality,\u201d Wednesday replies. \u201cI think you\u2019ll survive.\u201d\nOnce they\u2019re back at the house, they carry the tree inside and set it up in the living room. The room is empty, but a fire still burns low in the hearth as Enid hauls the tree into an upright position between two of the windows and then stands back to admire her work.\n\u201cHappy now?\u201d Wednesday asks dryly.\u00a0\n\u201cYes. No! Not yet. It needs to be decorated.\u201d Enid scrounges around the room, coming up with two leftover rolls of tinsel and one remaining string of lights, and tries her best to drape them around the tree.\u00a0\nWednesday strides over and takes the lights from Enid, wrapping them around the branches with startling efficiency. \u201cI was planning to remain uninvolved in this procedure, but this is too sad to watch anymore.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Enid says, grinning, \u201cor maybe you secretly wanted to decorate a Christmas tree with me this whole time.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYour delusion is admirable.\u201d Wednesday tucks the lights over one last branch before plugging them in; the tree comes suddenly to life in tiny bursts of sunset-hued color. \u201cNow let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Enid agrees, but she lingers one moment longer. Here in this room with Wednesday on Christmas Eve, bathed in the warmth of the fire and the glow of pink and white and orange, she feels surrounded by magic - and if this is a spell, she doesn\u2019t want it to break just yet.\u00a0\n--\nThe next morning, Enid is woken by Thing tapping politely at her shoulder. She yawns and stretches, not at all fazed, and she\u2019s about to roll over and go back to sleep when she remembers exactly what day it is.\u00a0\n\u201cOMG, Thing! Merry Christmas!\u201d\u00a0\n Merry Christmas, Thing signs in return, then moves onto Wednesday\u2019s shoulder and starts tapping again.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a slapping sound, and Thing hurries quickly away from Wednesday\u2019s side of the bed. Wednesday raises her head from a mess of pillows, disgruntled. \u201cYes, Thing, a very miserable Christmas to you, too. Now let me sleep, or I swear I\u2019ll stick you in that Chinese finger trap again.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go back to sleep,\u201d Enid protests, even though she\u2019d been planning on doing the exact same thing only minutes before. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas morning!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLamentable. Wake me again when it\u2019s Christmas evening - or better yet, when Christmas is over and done with.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cUgh, I give up. Thing, a little help?\u201d\u00a0\nThing flashes Enid a quick  okay, then takes Wednesday\u2019s phone from the nightstand and shoves it under Wednesday\u2019s nose, tapping against its edge until she raises her head again. Wednesday grudgingly cracks one eye open, then suddenly grabs the phone from Thing\u2019s grip and sits bolt upright.\u00a0\n\u201cEnid,\u201d Wednesday says in a very calm tone.\u00a0\nEnid winces. \u201cUh oh. I\u2019m in danger.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday holds out her phone, which Enid hasn\u2019t seen her use once since her arrival. The screen is displaying an ungodly amount of text message notifications; as Enid watches, several more appear.\u00a0\n\u201cLook,\u201d Wednesday says, unlocking the phone and handing it over. \u201cThis is your doing.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnknown Number\u00a0\n\n\n U DID NOT TELL ME U LIKED ENID\u00a0 \n\n\n AND U DID NOT TELL ME U WERE *DATING* ENID \n\n\n Also\u00a0 \n\n\n It\u2019s Eugene lol \n\n\n Hi!!!\u00a0 \n\n\n The bees miss u\u00a0 \n\n\n And I miss u\u00a0 \n\n\n U have to try some of their new honey\u00a0 \n\n\n It\u2019s so good\u00a0 \n\n\n But srsly y didn\u2019t u tell me abt liking Enid I wouldn\u2019t have tried to hit on her if I\u2019d known \n\n\n Call me back ASAP!\u00a0 \n\n\n Or at least text me\u00a0 \n\n\n Btw merry Christmas!\u00a0 \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe keeps messaging,\u201d Wednesday says, displeased. \u201cWhy did you feel the need to give him my contact information?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOMG, of course he does. He\u2019s your friend.\u201d Enid laughs. \u201cEugene is such a sweetie, I can even forgive him for terribly flirting with me last semester. I adore him - and I know you do too, deep down.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday makes a noise of dissent, locking her phone again. Enid gives her what she hopes is a stern look.  \u201cWednesday. Are you really going to leave him on read? On Christmas, too?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to encourage him. Rewarding unwanted behavior creates the false notion that said behavior is acceptable.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Enid says, pushing at Wednesday\u2019s knee.\u00a0 \u201cYou say that now, but watch. You\u2019ll end up answering.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI will not.\u201d\nThing, still resting on the nightstand, taps out a quick message:  Yes, you will.\u00a0 \n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Enid says, sliding out of bed and scooping Thing onto her shoulder before opening her duffel bag and pulling out the smaller bag that\u2019s been buried at the bottom for the last few days. \u201cForget Eugene, then. Let's go downstairs and open presents.\u201d\n\u201cFine by me. Lead the way.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid pushes the door open, waiting for Wednesday to follow. For one brief second, from the corner of her eye, she sees Wednesday laboriously typing a brief message into her phone before dropping it on the bed like it\u2019s personally offended her.\u00a0\n--\nDownstairs, Pugsley is already perched on the couch with a heap of black-wrapped presents piled at his feet. Morticia and Gomez are sitting on the loveseat by the fire, exchanging loving glances; Enid and Wednesday both avert their eyes, which Enid does quietly and Wednesday does with a loud retching noise.\u00a0\n\u201cThe only thing I want for Christmas is for the two of you to act your age for more than five minutes in a row,\u201d Wednesday remarks as she sits down on the other sofa. Enid sits next to her, curling into her side and hiding her smile when Wednesday doesn\u2019t pull away from the contact.\u00a0\n \u201cFeliz navidad, mi familia,\u201d  Gomez says happily, seemingly undeterred by Wednesday\u2019s comment. \u201cWednesday,  mija, open this first. It\u2019s from me and your mother.\u201d\u00a0\nHe passes over a thin box wrapped in glossy black paper. When Wednesday sets it down in her lap, it\u2019s long enough that it stretches across Enid\u2019s legs too.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd this is for you, Enid,\u201d Gomez adds. He hands over another package, this one also wrapped in black and tied with silver ribbons.\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Enid says, deeply flattered to be included in the gift exchange. She\u2019d brought presents from San Francisco for everyone in the household - she\u2019s not an inconsiderate guest - but she hadn\u2019t expected to receive any in return. \u201cThank you! Here, this is from me.\u201d\u00a0\nShe reaches into the bag that she brought downstairs, digs out the two identical packages she wrapped in smiling reindeer paper, and passes them to Gomez and Morticia, who regard them with deep interest.\u00a0\n\u201cEveryone stop giving out presents,\u201d Pugsley says. \u201cEnid has to open mine first. Here, Enid, catch!\u201d\u00a0\nHe chucks a large, square box across the room; Enid catches it with a laugh. \u201cSure, of course I\u2019ll open yours first. Do I get any kind of hint about what it is?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s my favorite bait,\u201d Pugsley says happily. \u201cNow you can come fishing with me and Enid once it\u2019s spring again.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid slides a finger under the wrapping paper, pulling it off in one long piece. \u201cSounds good, but won\u2019t fish bait get kind of old and gross by then?\u201d\u00a0\nPugsley just grins. \u201cNot this bait.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid gives him a quizzical look as she yanks the top off the box. \u201cWhat do you mean -  holy shit these are hand grenades!\u201d\u00a0 \nThing, still resting on Enid\u2019s shoulder, taps out a calming pattern for her. Wednesday looks into the box, then nods approvingly. \u201cThose are Pugsley\u2019s favorite form of bait. We\u2019ve caught thousands of fish that way.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cCan you eat them afterwards, or\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Pugsley assures her. \u201cWe just keep going until the pond is full of dead fish.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Enid says, inching away from the box of grenades in what she hopes is a subtle manner. \u201cYeah. Totally. Hey, is anyone else hungry right now? How about a snack break?\u201d\n--\nAn hour later, breakfast has been eaten and nearly all the presents have been unwrapped; gifts lie scattered at will across the living room. As Christmas hauls go, today\u2019s is a pretty good one.\u00a0\nWednesday has a new cello bow from her parents - with a sword hidden in the spine - as well as a dagger from Pugsley and a new pair of boots from Thing - who, judging by his smug stance, definitely didn\u2019t pay for them.\u00a0\nPugsley has a towering stack of presents, including something that looks worryingly like a bomb-making kit; Enid won\u2019t be surprised if the manor blows up in the next few days.\u00a0\nThing has a new tube of hand lotion from Wednesday and a new set of nail clippers from Gomez and Morticia. He\u2019s currently resting on the table by the fireplace, completely absorbed by the fidget spinner that Enid bought for him.\u00a0\nPugsley, Gomez, and Morticia are all wearing the matching black snoods that Enid brought for them, and it\u2019s giving Enid some much-needed validation. Enid\u2019s own family members never wear her creations, claiming that they\u2019re too hideous to be seen in public - and sure, maybe the first one she made for her brother\u2019s birthday turned out looking like a hairball, but whatever. She\u2019s gotten so much better at knitting since then.\u00a0\nEnid glances down yet again at the small wooden box in her lap, tracing her fingers over the carving on the lid. Gomez and Morticia\u2019s present is one that moved her nearly to tears when she opened it: a writing set complete with two bottles of ink and a set of fancy quills, all stored in a box engraved with the Addams family crest.\u00a0\n\u201cYou are one of the family now,\u201d Morticia had told her, \u201cand that will never change, no matter what comes to pass.\u201d\nEnid had planned to answer with an eloquent statement of gratitude, or at least in a complete sentence. Instead, she\u2019d just clutched the box to her chest and tried, not entirely successfully, to fight back tears.\u00a0\nShe\u2019s calmer now, after a cup of hot chocolate and a quick sign-language conversation with Thing about the magic of Christmas spirit. When she settles back onto the couch next to Wednesday for the last exchange of presents, she feels normal again.\u00a0\nIt doesn\u2019t last very long.\u00a0\n\u201cHere\u2019s your present,\u201d Wednesday remarks, passing over a small package wrapped in black. \u201cTry not to ruin it when you open it.\u201d\nEnid reaches into her bag for the one remaining gift and hands it to Wednesday. \u201cCan we open them at the exact same time? It\u2019ll be like one of those Christmas morning gift-exchange videos on Youtube. Or like an eclipse.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYour mind works in such absurd ways,\u201d Wednesday says, but her fingers go still against the bright pink paper of her present. \u201cVery well, then. On three?\u201d\n\u201cOn three,\u201d Enid confirms. \u201cOne\u2026two\u2026three.\u201d\nThey both start opening their presents, Enid tearing the paper from hers eagerly while Wednesday extracts hers from the shell of its wrappings with a surgical precision, and then there\u2019s a short silence while they process what they\u2019ve just been given.\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s holding a thin black scarf patterned with a series of small pink shapes: birds, she realizes, ravens added to the pattern in a rose-pink wool. The scarf is impossibly soft to the touch, clearly handmade, and it\u2019s beautiful.\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday,\u201d she says, stunned almost beyond speech. \u201cDid - did you make this for me?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou made me a garment once. I thought it would be appropriate to return the favor - and besides, you need a less colorful item for your wardrobe. Once I did some research, it was easy enough to learn the so-called skill of knitting.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really, really good,\u201d Enid says. \u201cI love it so much. Thank you.\u201d\nWednesday holds up her own gift: the small pink bag that Enid crocheted for her, only slightly lumpy on one side. \u201cI appreciate your gift as well. It\u2019s quite\u2026unique.\u201d\nEnid laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s only part of the gift. Open the bag.\u201d\nWednesday does so, reaching inside to pull out the real gift: an ornate black pocket watch, complete with a set of clockwork gears and a tiny wolf embossed on the casing, howling up at the moon. Enid had found it at a thrift store last month before she even knew she\u2019d be seeing Wednesday over the holidays: she\u2019d winced at the price tag but purchased it anyway, thinking of how much Wednesday would love it.\u00a0\nNow, seeing the way that Wednesday holds it like a living heart between her hands, Enid\u2019s glad she did.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is immaculate craftsmanship,\u201d Wednesday says, running a finger along the curves of the case. \u201cThe level of mastery here is one that I\u2019ve rarely seen, if ever. Where did you get it?\u201d\nEnid waves a hand. \u201cOh, I made it myself. No big deal.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday stares at her, unblinking. Enid laughs. \u201cJust kidding. I found it at a thrift store.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt will fit perfectly with my wardrobe,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cThank you. This is a miserable Christmas indeed.\u201d\nEnid frowns. \u201cWhat? Why miserable?\u201d\n\u201cMisery is one of my favorite feelings. A miserable Christmas is far better than a merry one.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, sure,\u201d Enid says fondly, shaking her head. \u201cWhatever you say. A miserable Christmas to you too.\u201d\u00a0\n--\nChristmas dinner is served late in the evening, but it\u2019s worth the wait; the massive ebony table is covered in golden plates and dishes, each one holding a different kind of food. Enid\u2019s never seen a spread like this before. Back at home, Christmas dinner is usually just a pile of rare steaks and a few sides of mashed potatoes and green beans.\u00a0\nHere at the Addams manor, things are different. The main dish is a roast that takes up half the table, and Enid isn\u2019t sure exactly what kind of meat it is, but it smells amazing. The plates surrounding it are filled with sides and appetizers, some normal and some not - there\u2019s a plate of potatoes side by side with a plate of bat wings, and the gravy boat sits next to a bowl of what looks like blood.\u00a0\nThe roast is carved, the food is served, and the meal flies by in a warm, comfortable haze of conversation and company. It\u2019s the first time in years that Enid\u2019s had a Christmas dinner without at least one fight breaking out before dessert; instead of her brothers all shouting over each other and her mother criticizing her, there\u2019s just the easy exchange of Wednesday and Gomez discussing fencing tactics, and Gomez teasing Pugsley for gloating so much over his Christmas presents, and Morticia asking about Enid\u2019s favorite classes at Nevermore.\u00a0\nThroughout it all, Enid is vividly aware of Wednesday in her peripheral, at her side. She thinks, fleetingly and with a pain like a burn in her chest, that in some ways she feels more at home here than she ever has back in San Francisco.\u00a0\nShe thinks, too, that she doesn\u2019t want to leave.\u00a0\nDessert comes and goes in the form of a towering dark chocolate mousse, and all too soon the meal is over and the clock\u2019s hands are pointing to ten. Enid, weighed down by far too much food and dizzy from the joy of it all, stumbles slightly as she gets up from her chair.\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s there in an instant, steadying her at the elbow. \u201cYou should be more careful,\u201d she says as she steers Enid toward the hall. \u201cThere isn\u2019t - \u201d\u00a0\nShe stops dead on the threshold between the room and the hallway, staring up at something above them. Enid follows her gaze, then immediately feels like she\u2019s taken a baseball bat to the head.\u00a0\nThere, hanging from the top of the doorway by a bright red ribbon, is a branch of mistletoe so large it nearly brushes both sides of the door.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, gross,\u201d Pugsley complains, pausing halfway up the staircase. \u201cNow they\u2019re going to kiss.\u201d\nEnid risks a look at Wednesday\u2019s expression, which is darker than a thunderstorm and twice as dangerous.\u00a0\n\u201cMother,\u201d Wednesday accuses. \u201cFather. Did either of you hang this arboreal abomination?\u201d\nMorticia shakes her head. Gomez says, \u201cNo,\u201d but there\u2019s a knowing gleam in his eye.\u00a0\n\u201cThing, then,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cOf course. He\u2019s a dead hand walking.\u201d\n\u201cHey, come on,\u201d Enid says quietly. \u201cWhere\u2019s your Christmas spirit? Besides, your parents are watching.\u201d\nThe corner of Wednesday\u2019s mouth twitches once in what Enid knows is a suppressed grimace. It\u2019s like a knife to Enid\u2019s stomach; of course this is too far for them to go, too much for her to hope for. Of course Wednesday would never actually -\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d Wednesday mutters. \u201cKiss me.\u201d\nEnid\u2019s mouth nearly falls open, and she just barely manages to keep a straight face. \u201cI - you - really?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cJust hurry up and do it before they get suspicious.\u201d\nEnid gathers her courage, pulls Wednesday closer. She takes one second to consider what she\u2019s about to do, and one more to acknowledge that her life will never be the same after this, and then she leans in and kisses Wednesday.\nIt\u2019s careful and delicate, and they\u2019ve never been here before but there\u2019s something about it that feels familiar anyway. Wednesday\u2019s lips are soft against hers, and Enid feels a sensation like a dying star exploding in her chest when Wednesday\u2019s hand rises to cradle her jaw. She knows, deep and instinctual, that this kiss is something she\u2019ll never be able to get over. She\u2019ll live it, breathe it, carry this memory in her heart like a sentient thing; when she dies, it will probably be with Wednesday\u2019s name and the ghost of this kiss on her lips.\u00a0\nAnd then it\u2019s over, and Wednesday is drawing back with an inscrutable look on her face. Enid touches one hand to her own mouth, wondering if Wednesday can see every place inside her that\u2019s shattering.\u00a0\n\u201cEw,\u201d Pugsley declares, and the spell is broken. \u201cGet a room, you guys.\u201d\n\u201cAnd leave the door open,\u201d Morticia adds, stern but amused. \u201cI noticed, Enid, that our guest room has been vacant for days now.\u201d\n\u201cThe ghouls disturb her,\u201d Wednesday says, her tone maddeningly neutral. \u201cWe\u2019re going upstairs now, where our sleeping arrangements will continue as they have been and nobody will interfere unless they wish to meet an untimely demise. A miserable Christmas to you all.\u201d\u00a0\nShe turns on her heel and makes her way up the stairs gracefully. Enid follows with shaky steps, feeling the world renew itself around her.\u00a0\n--\nBack in Wednesday\u2019s room, the silence is deafening.\u00a0\nEnid sits on the right side of the bed, her body still on fire from their kiss and her brain nervous in a way that it hasn\u2019t been around Wednesday for months now. Wednesday sits on the left, her expression an impenetrable fortress that tells Enid a useless, infuriating tale of nothing.\u00a0\nFinally, Enid can\u2019t take it anymore.\u00a0\n\u201cShould we talk about this?\u201d she asks apprehensively. \u201cI mean, I feel like maybe we should.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wednesday says immediately. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d Enid waves her hands, trying to find words for the endless tangle of thoughts in her mind. \u201cYou aren\u2019t - you don\u2019t usually - I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be okay. With that.\u201d\n\u201cActing is necessary for the success of any subterfuge,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cEverything is in order.\u201d\n\u201cBut - \u201d\u00a0\n\u201cEnid,\u201d Wednesday says, in a tone that brooks no argument. \u201cI am finished with this discussion.\u201d\nEnid bows her head slightly, trying to hide her face. She\u2019s not upset, exactly. She\u2019s just - worried.\u00a0\nWorried, because she doesn\u2019t know if everything is truly in order or Wednesday\u2019s secretly mad at her. Worried, because now that she\u2019s kissed Wednesday she doesn\u2019t know how to carry on living without doing it again.\u00a0\nThe silence between them grows unbearable, and Enid\u2019s so restless with emotion she\u2019s almost ready to climb out of her own body. Thing, perched on the desk, taps a quiet, nervous pattern against the wood.\u00a0\n\u201cRemind me of the title of that ludicrous movie you wanted me to watch,\u201d Wednesday says after an agonizing few minutes.\u00a0\nEnid perks up, confused but hopeful.  \u201cMean Girls. Why?\u201d\nWednesday ignores the question. \u201cDo you have your laptop device?\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cYeah.\u201d Enid reaches for her duffel bag, slides her laptop from the side pocket. \u201cIs this you offering to watch it with me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not. I suppose, however, that I wouldn\u2019t entirely mind if you watched it yourself while I happened to be within the vicinity.\u201d Wednesday moves onto the bed and leans back against the pillows, leaving space by her side;\u00a0 Enid, recognizing the peace offering for what it is, lies down next to her and opens her laptop to find the movie. Over on the desk, Thing subtly switches off the lamp.\u00a0\nThe movie begins, and Enid tries her best to get lost in the plot instead of focusing on Wednesday\u2019s presence beside her. She\u2019s only partly successful; ignoring Wednesday is like trying to ignore a rainstorm, especially when she keeps darting glances in Enid\u2019s direction.\u00a0\nAfter a few minutes of this, Enid presses the spacebar to pause the movie. \u201cWednesday, are you actually watching?\u201d\nWednesday sniffs, hard. \u201cDon\u2019t be a cretin. I have no interest in your vapid, pink-washed teenage drama.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sure,\u201d Enid says, inching closer to her and sliding the laptop over until it\u2019s centered between them, then starting the movie again. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine watching alone, then.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nSeven minutes later, Enid catches a glimpse of Wednesday from the corner of her eye: she\u2019s staring at the screen, intent and focused. Enid whips her gaze away before Wednesday can notice, a thread of some bright and breathless emotion uncurling in her stomach.\u00a0\n--\nAs they are every year, the days after Christmas are a strange and liminal space. Time slides by in mysterious ways, sometimes fast and sometimes slow; an hour becomes a day, a minute becomes a year.\u00a0\nEnid and Wednesday spend these days doing nothing much - just lazing around the house, eating Christmas leftovers, walking and sleeping and dreaming.\u00a0\nThe house opens itself up, unwinding like a never-ending corridor; together they walk the rooms until Enid knows the west wing, at least, well enough to map it with her eyes closed, can trace the path from library to conservatory to astronomy tower and back to Wednesday\u2019s room like a habit.\nWednesday spends hours reading a set of weathered, leather-bound books from the library, taking handwritten notes in a small black notebook as she goes. Enid doesn\u2019t bother to ask what she\u2019s doing, figuring that Wednesday will share when she\u2019s ready. Instead, she watches videos on her phone while Wednesday reads by her side. She even keeps her headphones in so Wednesday isn\u2019t disturbed.\u00a0\nIn the mornings, they eat informal breakfasts in the formal dining room - pancakes, buttered toast - and Enid throws blueberries to Pugsley to see if he can catch them in his mouth. Morticia shakes her head, and Wednesday scoffs about their \u201cjuvenile idiocy,\u201d but neither of them intervene.\u00a0\nIn the afternoons, Wednesday plays chess against Gomez down in the sitting room and Enid watches with Thing on her shoulder and a fire crackles in the hearth. There\u2019s something devastating about the calculated, concentrated look on Wednesday\u2019s face as she moves her pieces around the board; Enid has to distract herself by talking to Thing so she won\u2019t end up watching too closely.\nAnd in the evenings, when they find themselves back in Wednesday\u2019s room, they stretch out on her bed and share the same space while doing different things. Enid listens while Wednesday practices her cello; Wednesday works on her novel while Enid crochets; Enid scrolls through her phone while Wednesday scribbles notes in the margins of the newspaper\u2019s obituaries column. Enid's moonflower, sitting on the corner of Wednesday's desk, blooms pink through the nights. It\u2019s just like it was back at Nevermore, the two of them alone but still together. Enid doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever get tired of this.\u00a0\nThey talk about almost everything - art, food, fashion, Korean girl groups, the history of the guillotine, the possible replacements for Nevermore\u2019s head of school next semester. They don\u2019t talk about the kiss.\u00a0\nEnid wants to - she wants to so badly that the desire is an ache in her ribs - but she thinks of everything she stands to lose and the words freeze in her throat. She won\u2019t sacrifice what she has with Wednesday now, not for anything.\u00a0\nIn four days, she reminds herself, this will all be over and she and Wednesday will go back to what they were before: nothing more, everything less, all of the holidays like a dream long forgotten between them. Four days, that\u2019s all. She trusts herself not to ruin this before that time runs out.\u00a0\nShe doesn\u2019t ask about the kiss, then. She does ask about other things.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you ever going to let me read your novels?\u201d she says on the second night. She\u2019s sprawled across the bed with Thing resting next to her; Wednesday\u2019s sitting straight-backed at her writing desk, typing away with a consistent clatter of keys that\u2019s becoming less unbearable and more comforting the longer Enid hears it.\u00a0\nWednesday stops typing, turns around. \u201cPerhaps. Once they\u2019re all finished. However, due to recent developments, I don\u2019t foresee that happening soon.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat developments?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m at a curious stage in my latest manuscript,\u201d Wednesday admits reluctantly. \u201cViper has reached a point in the narrative where she is dealing with some unexpected things - unexpected to her as a character, but also to me as her author.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Enid tilts her head, curious. \u201cWhat kind of things?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday narrows her eyes in displeasure. \u201cFrom the start, I never intended for Viper to have a love interest. Nevertheless, in all my recent writings, she seems to be drawn into the orbit of one specific other character no matter how I try to avoid it. It\u2019s most irritating.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Enid says, her heart hammering in her throat, \u201cmaybe that\u2019s just where the story is headed. Maybe you should let it happen.\u201d\n\u201cIt does seem rather inevitable, sometimes,\u201d Wednesday concedes, pensive. \u201cOnly time will tell.\u201d\u00a0\nShe turns back to her writing. Enid stares up at the ceiling, wondering if there\u2019s any way this story will end happily for her.\u00a0\n--\nDecember\u2019s full moon falls on the third night after Christmas, clear-skied and freezing. Enid is lethargic this evening, worn-out and apathetic; she looks at the sky and feels nothing, no humming promise of change beneath her skin.\nOne moon without wolfing out again is an anomaly, but two will be the final nail in her coffin. Enid curls up on Wednesday\u2019s bed in a fit of exhausted despair, resolving not to even look out the window. The moon calls, but she doesn\u2019t listen; the words aren\u2019t for her, and she\u2019s starting to think they never will be again. There\u2019s nothing in the world that can move her from this bed, except -\u00a0\n\u201cEnid,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cGet up.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid half-raises her head from the pillows, staring blearily at Wednesday; the other girl is standing by the foot of the bed, her black notebook tucked under her arm. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cGet up,\u201d Wednesday repeats. \u201cWe\u2019re going outside.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOutside?\u201d Enid scoffs. \u201cDon\u2019t bother. There\u2019s no point, I\u2019m not going to wolf out.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI know that it didn\u2019t happen last time, but there\u2019s still a possibility. Besides, the temperature is below freezing now and I quite enjoy the pain of self-induced hypothermia.\u201d\nEnid shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday takes hold of the bed covers, tugs sharply until the covers slide away from Enid and leave her exposed to the air. \u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous, and frankly quite self-pitying as well. Get up.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid lets out a half-growl of annoyance, her claws sliding out automatically. \u201cWednesday, leave me alone. It\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\u201cEnid,\u201d Wednesday says. She leans over the bed, over Enid\u2019s body, until she\u2019s the only thing filling Enid\u2019s vision; well, there\u2019s a familiar feeling. \u201cYou are a werewolf in either form, and you belong under the full moon. And I - \u201d She grimaces, distasteful with emotion, and then continues. \u201cI would like to be there with you.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s heartbeat skips recklessly forward, tumbling over itself at Wednesday\u2019s words.\u00a0\n\u201cI will never repeat that driveling sentiment,\u201d Wednesday warns, \u201cbut you heard me. So - will you get up?\u201d\nAfter a minute, Enid sits up and puts on her shoes, then reaches for the scarf that Wednesday made her. She may not be able to wolf out, but maybe that\u2019s alright; maybe she\u2019s found something better than the moon to follow.\u00a0\n--\nThe air outside is North-pole frigid, but it\u2019s still and quiet - no wind to speak of, only an endless sea of stars above them. Wednesday leads the way to the back of the manor, towards a bench that overlooks the lake, and they sit down side by side without a word.\nEnid looks up at the moon, hanging low over the treetops like a great silver coin in the night, and feels a deep sense of bitterness flood her mouth. She should be shifting right now, should be out and running with her pack. She should be different, better, changed into something good enough to outweigh the useless wreck of her life thus far.\u00a0\nShe should be anything but this: a half-baked excuse for a werewolf, wholly human beneath the full moon and desperately, irretrievably in love with her best friend.\u00a0\nWednesday, oblivious to Enid\u2019s inner turmoil, is leafing through the notebook that\u2019s seldom left her side for the past three days. Enid tips her head to see pages of notes scrawled in Wednesday\u2019s angular, elegant script.\u00a0\n\u201cYou never told me what you were writing in there,\u201d she comments.\nWednesday\u2019s mouth flattens to a thin line, a gesture that Enid recognizes as falling somewhere\u00a0 between annoyance and embarrassment. Silently, she opens the notebook to a page at random and hands it over to Enid.\u00a0\nEnid takes it, her eyes scanning down the flowing lines of writing. Here and there, words jump out at her:  lycan, blood moon, half-shift. At the bottom of the page, in heavy ink strokes, is a rough drawing of a wolf running beneath a full, round moon.\u00a0\n\u201cResearch,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cI read every book that the Addams family library has on werewolves, and I wrote down everything I thought might be even tangentially significant to helping you shift again.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid lowers the notebook, a chord of awe striking deep within her bones. \u201cYou did this for me?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI did,\u201d Wednesday says, a note of frustration creeping into her tone, \u201cand it told me nothing. There was all this talk of cures, of conversions - that\u2019s not what I was looking for. You don\u2019t need to be cured.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday - \u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI know your family pressures you about finding a way to wolf out,\u201d Wednesday continues, \u201cand I never want to emulate them. I only wish to help because I see how miserable this makes you, no matter how you try to hide it.\u201d\u00a0\n \u201cWednesday,\u201d Enid interrupts, closing the notebook. \u201cStop. Listen to me.\u201d\nAgainst all odds, Wednesday does.\u00a0\n\u201cIt means so much to me that you did this,\u201d Enid says, and it\u2019s honest down to her bones. Here\u2019s ink-and-paper proof that Wednesday cares for her, filling up pages and pages and built not from the desire to change her, but from the wish to make her happy. It\u2019s enough to make Enid\u2019s eyes sting with salt, and if she didn\u2019t know before, she surely knows now; there will never, ever be a time when she isn\u2019t in love with Wednesday Addams.\u00a0\nWednesday just nods, her shoulder barely brushing against Enid\u2019s. Their breaths turn to ghosts against the cold, tiny spirals drifting through the air.\u00a0\n\u201cI guess maybe this was too much to ask for,\u201d Enid admits half to herself, resting one hand on the cover of the notebook. \u201cI should have known better than to think that one full moon was enough to change me for good.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cO, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,\u201d Wednesday murmurs in response. \u201cFrom\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShakespeare, I know.  Romeo and Juliet \u00a0- everyone had to read that for ninth grade English.\u201d The corner of Enid\u2019s mouth twitches briefly upwards. \u201cWasn\u2019t expecting you to quote a love story, though.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nWednesday makes a dismissive sound. \u201cIt\u2019s not a love story. It\u2019s a comedy.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cA comedy? They both die at the end!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAs I said. A comedy.\u201d\nEnid lets out a short laugh that comes out more like a bark against the cold night air. \u201cOnly you would think that.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m correct,\u201d Wednesday counters, \u201cso here we are.\u201d\u00a0\nMore silence. More cold. Enid\u2019s hand rests side by side with Wednesdays, both of their fingers turning blue, but she doesn\u2019t dare to close the last two inches between them.\u00a0\n\u201cThe main thing I read in those lycanthropy books, besides a disgustingly prevalent case for conversion therapy,\u201d Wednesday says, in a voice almost softer than Enid\u2019s ever heard from her before, \u201cis that there\u2019s no rushing what\u2019s to come. You can try and try, but nothing will ever happen before its time.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBut that\u2019s the thing,\u201d Enid says frustratedly. \u201cI thought my time had come, and then it hadn\u2019t, and now I don\u2019t know  what to think. I\u2019m no use to anyone like this. I may as well just be dead.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a flash of dark movement in her peripheral, and then Wednesday\u2019s hand is at the side of her face, cradling her jaw.\u00a0\nEnid stops breathing, stays perfectly still. It\u2019s the first time Wednesday\u2019s touched her since the kiss three days ago, and the contact sears through Enid like a hot knife despite the coldness of Wednesday\u2019s hand.\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever say that about yourself.\u201d The softness is gone from Wednesday\u2019s voice; she\u2019s all iron now, all thunder and storm. \u201cDespite the fact that the idea of death is usually appealing to me - despite the fact that I have on multiple occasions entertained a fantasy in which it comes for you while you are playing your ear-bleeding pop music - the prospect of a world without you in it is no longer one that is bearable to me. You are important, Enid, no matter what shape you take. More than that, you are important to  me.\u201d\u00a0 \nWednesday cuts herself off abruptly, her chest rising and falling slightly from the passion of her outburst. Enid remains frozen where she is, immobilized by Wednesday\u2019s touch. She doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever move from this place as long as she lives.\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday,\u201d she manages, and nothing more, because if she allows herself to say anything else it will be replaced by:  I love you.\u00a0 \nWednesday\u2019s other hand rises to touch Enid\u2019s forehead, her fingertips ghosting soft over the thin ridge of Enid\u2019s scars. Against her will, Enid\u2019s eyes flutter closed momentarily.\u00a0\n\u201cYou saved my life,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cAnd I will return the favor someday, even if it takes a thousand years.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid thinks: I know you will.  She thinks:  You already have.\u00a0 \nWednesday lets her fingers fall away from Enid\u2019s scars, but leaves her other hand resting at the turn of her jaw. She\u2019s only a breath away, so impossibly close that it hurts. Enid\u2019s heartbeat hovers in her chest like a hummingbird mid-flight; she leans forward ever so slightly, waiting to see if Wednesday will pull away.\u00a0\nWednesday doesn\u2019t.\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d Enid says belatedly, her voice a bare shell of a whisper. \u201cI know you will.\u201d There\u2019s a storm of emotion building within her, a feeling so big and beautiful her bones can\u2019t contain it - forget the world, forget the moon, she\u2019s bound only to the girl in front of her. She takes a deep breath, throws pride and caution to the winds, leans in closer -\n- and quickly jerks backwards, slipping from Wednesday\u2019s grasp as a full-body spasm rips through her like an earthquake.\u00a0\n\u201cEnid,\u201d Wednesday says, sharp with concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u00a0\nEnid can\u2019t reply. There\u2019s a new feeling overtaking her body now, a soul-splitting, bone-breaking pull that bursts through her like a river flooding its banks. She\u2019s turning inside out, tearing at the seams, and she\u2019s never felt anything like this before, except -  oh -\u00a0 \nEnid twists, turns, falls to the ground as her chest burns and her lungs strain and every bone in her body aches. When she rises, everything looks different.\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s staring up at her, except something\u2019s wrong; she\u2019s so small now, so fragile-looking. Enid has a deep, sudden urge to curl up around her and protect her from the world, no matter how much she would hate it.\u00a0\n\u201cEnid,\u201d Wednesday says, surprise and something like amazement breaking through the usual wall of her expression. \u201cYou did it. You wolfed out.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid looks down at her hands, only to realize that they\u2019re paws. Wednesday\u2019s closer to her now, saying something -\u00a0\nAnd then everything goes black.\u00a0\n--\nEnid blinks her eyes open again, coming back slowly. She\u2019s stretched across the snowy ground, her limbs sprawled out in every direction, and everything smells like Wednesday, soap and midnight rain.\u00a0\nAlso, she\u2019s still a wolf.\u00a0\nEnid jumps to her feet - paws? - and looks around wildly for Wednesday. She doesn\u2019t have to look far.\u00a0\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cCan you still understand me?\u201d\nEnid nods.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d\u00a0\nEnid nods again. It\u2019s a much harder gesture when she\u2019s not in human form - it involves a lot more concentration.\u00a0\nWednesday stretches out one hand towards Enid, slow and deliberate, like she\u2019s not sure if Enid will allow it. Enid does; she can\u2019t imagine that there\u2019s any world or shape in which she would refuse Wednesday\u2019s touch. Wednesday rubs her fingers carefully at the base of Enid\u2019s ear, and Enid closes her eyes blissfully.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m really not an animal person,\u201d Wednesday says, \u201cbut believe it or not, you seem more intelligent in this form. Do you want to come inside for the night? You should be able to fit through the main door.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid nods, following at Wednesday\u2019s heels as the other girl leads her back to the manor. Wednesday pulls the front doors open effortlessly, letting Enid into the massive hall of the foyer.\u00a0\n\u201cThe corridors are large enough that you should be able to get back to the room,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cTry not to break anything.\u201d\nEnid pads after Wednesday, up the stairs and down the hall until they reach the familiar black-lacquer door. Enid squeezes herself gingerly through the door frame, careful not to knock over the desk or the bookshelf.\u00a0\n\u201cHere,\u201d Wednesday says, gesturing to the space next to her bed. \u201cYou can sleep on the carpet.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid lies down gratefully, curling her body into a circle and closing her eyes. She expects Wednesday to get into bed, but there\u2019s no sound of mattress springs; instead, there\u2019s the soft noise of silk against velvet, and the patter of bare feet against floorboards, and then Wednesday is sitting down next to her. Enid\u2019s eyes fly open, disbelieving.\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d Wednesday says, leaning into Enid\u2019s side and spreading the black duvet from her bed across her legs. \u201cYour fur is warmer than my bedsheets, that\u2019s all. Mention this in the morning and I\u2019ll make you into a rug.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid just smiles, curling tighter around Wednesday. They drift off to sleep just like that, a girl and a wolf tangled in an embrace that\u2019s half human and all heart.\u00a0\n--\n\u201cYour fur is everywhere,\u201d Wednesday complains the next morning, shaking out her duvet. \u201cMust you shed all over everything?\u201d\nEnid, back in human form, turns guiltily from where she\u2019s sitting at Wednesday\u2019s desk. The duvet is indeed covered in golden-white hair, with a mix of pink and blue scattered in. \u201cHuh. Would you look at that.\u201d\nWednesday gives the blanket one last shake, then folds it into precise thirds and puts it back on her bed. \u201cNext time you wolf out, you\u2019re getting an old bath towel instead of my perfectly good duvet.\u201d She examines Enid for a second, eyes trailing clinically over her form. \u201cDo you think there will be a next time?\u201d\u00a0\nEnid raises one hand, slides her claws out effortlessly. She feels a subtle power running below her skin, spreading through her veins like moonlight in her blood - there\u2019s something different this time. She closes her eyes briefly, remembers Wednesday\u2019s touch against her scars; in her mind\u2019s eye, the full moon slides into view. When she listens, she hears Wednesday\u2019s heartbeat like a metronome. When she smiles, her canine teeth are longer and sharper.\u00a0\n\u201cI do,\u201d Enid says, as sure as she\u2019s ever been. \u201cWhen I wolfed out before, I didn\u2019t feel like this afterwards. This time, this full moon, it hits different.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHits different,\u201d Wednesday repeats, like she doesn\u2019t quite understand what Enid\u2019s saying. \u201cI don\u2019t understand that phrase.\u201d\n\u201cYou would if you went on your phone more than once a month,\u201d Enid scolds her. \u201cHonestly, Wednesday, you need to get with the times. There\u2019s so much internet lore for you to catch up on.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday just scoffs, then scoops up a black heap of clothing at the foot of her bed and tosses it in Enid\u2019s direction. Enid catches it, baffled, and unfolds it: a black sweater, partly stretched at the collar but warm and soft. \u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cYou ruined my duvet already; you may as well ruin an article of my clothing as well.\u201d It\u2019s said distastefully, but there\u2019s a slight crease at the edge of her mouth that belies a deeper emotion.\u00a0\nEnid happily pulls the sweater on over her pink t-shirt; it fits almost perfectly, and it smells so much like Wednesday that it makes her head spin. \u201cYou know, if I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d almost say that you\u2019re starting to really like me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cA preposterous notion to say the least.\u201d Wednesday crosses the room to sit on the edge of the bed, facing Enid. \u201cYour presence is tolerable at best.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid meets Wednesday\u2019s eyes, finds them unfathomable. They\u2019re back here, then - back to the pretense and the banter, back to the endless push and pull. Back to pretending that Wednesday\u2019s speech last night didn\u2019t tear Enid\u2019s still-beating heart from her chest.\u00a0\nMaybe it\u2019s better this way, Enid tells herself. Maybe, if she lives this lie long enough, she\u2019ll begin to believe it.\u00a0\nShe\u2019s just about to make another joke when Wednesday reaches out and straightens her sweater, pulling gently at the collar.\u00a0\n\u201cYou look imbecilic,\u201d Wednesday tells her, and maybe Enid\u2019s imagining it, but she swears she hears a minute crack in Wednesday\u2019s voice: a tiny thing, like the tremor before an earthquake. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to wear my clothes, wear them right.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d Enid echoes, her gaze dropping unconsciously to the curve of Wednesday\u2019s mouth and then immediately rising again.\u00a0\nWednesday stands over her, hands still caught at the edge of Enid\u2019s sweater, eyes wide and dark like the windows of a haunted house where Enid would gladly live forever, and Enid knows that someday they\u2019ll have to start talking about this.\u00a0 Someday she won\u2019t be able to live with this secret anymore; it\u2019ll spill out of her like a flood, like the tides.\n\u201cHey, Wednesday?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIf you ever tell the story of last night, or if you ever hear me tell it - can you leave out the part where I fainted right after wolfing out?\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not what Enid wants to say, really. It\u2019s not even close. But Wednesday\u2019s lips curl a fraction of an inch higher, and that\u2019s almost enough.\u00a0\n\u201cI make no promises,\u201d Wednesday says, that faint ghost of a smile still tracing the edge of her mouth. She looks like the moon, whole and luminous, and even without wolfing out Enid feels something changing irreversibly within herself at the sight.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re the worst,\u201d Enid says, meaning the exact opposite. \u201cLet\u2019s go to breakfast. Oh, wait - here.\u201d\nShe reaches for the hoodie she draped over the railing of Wednesday\u2019s bed last night and holds it out to Wednesday, who visibly recoils.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are you attempting to hand me that putrid garment?\u201d\u00a0\nEnid shrugs. \u201cYou gave me your sweater, so I\u2019m giving you one of mine. Fair\u2019s fair.\u201d Of all the clothes she brought with her, this one\u2019s the closest to acceptable by Wednesday\u2019s standards: it\u2019s a over-sized purple hoodie with a small pink rose embroidered on the chest. It\u2019s not exactly black, but it\u2019s darker than almost anything else she owns.\u00a0\nWednesday looks absolutely disgusted, but she takes it - and then, in an impossible maneuver, a Christmas miracle come four days too late, she puts it on.\u00a0\nEnid stares, transfixed. Wednesday\u2019s nearly drowning in the hoodie, her arms lost somewhere in the over-long sleeves, and her braids are slightly messy from the cotton static; she looks, in a word, ridiculous. Enid\u2019s never seen anything more beautiful.\u00a0\n\u201cYou wanted me to wear this, didn\u2019t?\u201d Wednesday says grumpily. \u201cStop looking at me like that.\u201d Then to Thing, who\u2019s tapping his fingers gleefully against the desk: \u201cNot one word.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo - I mean, yes, I wanted that,\u201d Enid says. There\u2019s something warm burning in the pit of her stomach, a flint striking tinder at the sight of Wednesday in clothes that are obviously and undeniably hers. \u201cI just never thought you\u2019d actually do it. What about your allergy?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cExposure therapy. Besides, the sensation of flesh peeling off my bones is rather pleasant sometimes.\u201d Wednesday smoothes her braids down, then glances in the mirror and grimaces at her reflection. \u201cIf my family knows what\u2019s good for them, they won\u2019t say a word about this.\u201d\u00a0\nFive minutes later, as soon as they step into the dining room, Pugsley blurts out, \u201cWednesday, you\u2019re wearing  colors?\u201d and Enid has to hold Wednesday back from overturning the dining table.\u00a0\n--\nThe next two days slip away in a haze of hours lost somewhere between the lake and the house and Wednesday\u2019s room, and the last day of December arrives far before Enid is ready for it. She wakes up with a sense of dread on the morning of the New Year\u2019s ball - a sense of dread, and a persistent ache in her ears that stems from some kind of commotion downstairs.\u00a0\nEnid groans, cursing the sharpness of her hearing, and rolls over to find Wednesday resting against the headboard, already awake and reading a book.\u00a0\n\u201cPreparations for the ball,\u201d Wednesday says, anticipating Enid\u2019s question. \u201cThey start earlier and earlier every year. My parents have an inexplicable passion for formal celebrations.\u201d\nEnid presses her hands to her ears. \u201cWhat are they doing down there, building a whole new house?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRearranging furniture in the ballroom, most likely. My father insists that the layout can never be the same twice. I must say, I have to respect his commitment.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHow big is this ball, anyway?\u201d Enid questions, pushing at Wednesday\u2019s arm until she sets down her book and then shifting around to rest her head in Wednesday\u2019s lap. Wednesday makes a grudging noise of assent, allowing this to happen like it\u2019s habit. With a thrill, Enid realizes that it is.\u00a0\nWednesday hums, calculating. \u201cExcluding the orchestra, the average attendance is around one hundred and sixty people. It\u2019s mostly distant relatives and family friends, but my father always invites the local community as well.\u201d A wry look crosses her face. \u201cNone of the mundane guests have ever returned.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cA hundred and\u2026\u201d Enid chokes around the number, her voice rapidly rising. \u201cThat - that\u2019s so many. I thought this would be, like, a cute little party, not a huge event. Oh god, I definitely didn\u2019t pack the right dress.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFashion is relative,\u201d Wednesday says, \u201cand furthermore, if anyone challenges your attire, I\u2019ll eviscerate them.\u201d\nEnid\u2019s heart flutters at that, and she tries her best to ignore it. \u201cYou know, just once you could find a way of expressing your affection that doesn\u2019t involve threatening people.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I? Murdering one person on behalf of another is one of the grandest gestures you can make to demonstrate your devotion.\u201d Wednesday picks up her book again, resting it gently against Enid\u2019s forehead. \u201cBetter make yourself comfortable. Leaving this room any time before the ball begins will only ensure that we are roped into helping.\u201d\u00a0\nAs much as Enid wants to give in, to spend her last full day here with Wednesday and no one else, she can\u2019t allow herself to do it. The more she holds on today, the harder it will be to let go tomorrow.\u00a0\n\u201cCome on,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s go help. Your parents let me stay for almost two weeks - this is the least I can do to thank them.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYour altruism would be admirable if it weren\u2019t so foolish,\u201d Wednesday says, setting her book aside for the second time. \u201cYou have no idea what awaits us downstairs. The d\u00e9cor, the ice sculptures\u2026I shudder to even think of the hor d\u2019oeuvres.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday,\u201d Enid laughs. \u201cIt can\u2019t possibly be that bad.\u201d\n--\n\u201cYou just had to say something,\u201d Wednesday grumbles later that evening.\u00a0\nEnid can only sigh in response, collapsing onto Wednesday\u2019s bed. \u201cWho knew that putting together canap\u00e9s could be so exhausting?\u201d\u00a0\nThe second they\u2019d appeared downstairs that morning, Morticia had paused her directions to the servicemen long enough to assign them a series of tasks. Now, six hours of flower arranging, cutlery polishing, and canap\u00e9-assembling later, they\u2019ve finally been spared long enough to clean up and change before the ball begins.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to shower,\u201d Wednesday announces, \u201cand you should do the same. You can have my bathroom; I\u2019ll use the one down the hall. Meet me on the stairs to the ballroom at a quarter to nine.\u201d\nEnid blinks, disappointed. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get ready together? Do our hair and makeup, maybe watch a few music videos to get ourselves hyped up? I know you said you hate all pop music, but I think you could like Blackpink if you\u2019d just give them a try.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d rather cut my own ears off than listen to that drivel,\u201d Wednesday says, \u201cand as for preparing ourselves, we\u2019ll be better off in separate rooms.\u201d\u00a0\nIt feels oddly like a rejection. Enid tries not to take it personally, but she can\u2019t help feeling like Wednesday\u2019s already slipping away.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she says, keeping her voice light even as her heart sinks. \u201cOkay, yeah, sounds good.\u201d\nWednesday moves around the room in a whirlwind, collecting items: a towel, a makeup kit, a garment bag. She scoops Thing onto her shoulder, and then she\u2019s gone without a backwards glance.\nEnid sits on the bed and watches mournfully as the door closes behind her, trying not to look like the world\u2019s most pathetic loser. She\u2019s pretty sure she fails miserably.\u00a0\nUnwilling to get dressed just yet, Enid scrolls through her phone aimlessly. She likes Eugene\u2019s latest post about bees; she checks on the status of her blog, which she\u2019s all but abandoned since the end of the semester; and then she opens her messages and pauses when she sees her mother\u2019s name near the bottom of the screen.\nThe last exchange is from nearly a week ago - a simple Merry Christmas, nothing more. Enid still hasn\u2019t told her about wolfing out. For some reason, she wants to keep it to herself for just a little longer.\u00a0\nHer thumbs hover above the screen, torn between the part of her that remembers nights lost in tears over things her mother said and the part of her that still, despite it all, wants to run and hide in her arms like a scared little kid. In the end, she drops the phone back on the bed without typing anything.\u00a0\n--\nEnid arrives on the ballroom steps at a quarter to nine, dressed as fancily as she can manage under the circumstances and brimming with anxiety. Her claws keep sliding out involuntarily, seeking a threat that\u2019s not there, and she keeps having to pull them back - which is embarrassing, but not as embarrassing as the way she\u2019s lurking half-hidden behind a large plant as she waits for Wednesday to show up.\u00a0\n\u201cI would advise against standing so close to the venomous flowervine,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s voice says from behind her. \u201cIt\u2019s carnivorous.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Enid jokes as she turns around, \u201cI am too, now that I can wolf out again,\u201d and then she catches sight of Wednesday and stops breathing.\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s wearing a long, sweeping black satin dress that pulls tight in a corset at her waist before flaring out into skirts of elaborate lace. The collar rises high around her neck, perfectly straightened, and there\u2019s a small white shape sewn into the silk on each side - crescent moons, Enid realizes in a daze.\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s hair is arranged in a crown of braids, striking and regal. Two satin bands wrap around her forearms, each holding a thin dagger in a black leather sheath, and she\u2019s wearing her familiar black boots; as a final touch, the pocket watch that Enid gave her hangs from her neck like a pendant.\u00a0\nShe\u2019s dressed similar to how she was at the Rave\u2019N, but there are differences, too: tonight she stands taller, moves freer, looks more dangerous. The only thing that hasn\u2019t changed at all is the way Enid\u2019s breath catches at the back of her throat when she looks at her.\u00a0\nOh, Enid is  screwed.\u00a0 \nWednesday\u2019s eyes sweep over her, dark and unreadable as always. Enid smoothes her hands over her own dress, self-conscious. She\u2019s wearing a pink dress significantly shorter than Wednesday\u2019s, with tights so light rose-colored they look white. She\u2019s also wearing her pink Converse, because she\u2019d stupidly forgotten to pack more formal shoes.\u00a0\n\u201cYou look\u2026more than adequate,\u201d Wednesday says at last, looking strangely unhappy about it.\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Enid says, hearing her own words echo vaguely in her ears. \u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cHow disappointing. I thought I looked abhorrent - or, at the very least, horrible.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid laughs. \u201cOnly you would take  beautiful  as an insult. Um, you look\u2026breathtaking? In the metaphorical way but also the murderous way?\u201d\n\u201cAcceptable.\u201d Wednesday produces something pink from behind her back and holds it out to Enid. \u201cHere. I brought you something.\u201d\nIt\u2019s two things, actually: a set of matching daggers in sheaths, rose-pink but otherwise perfectly matching the ones strapped to Wednesday\u2019s own arms. Enid cradles them in her hands, amazed. \u201cThese are for me?\u201d\n\u201cI know you are more than capable of defending yourself without weapons,\u201d Wednesday explains, \u201cbut the gift of a blade to the person you\u2019re courting is an Addams family tradition that goes back centuries. I would have given them to you earlier, but crafting them proved to be marginally more difficult than I had expected.\u201d\n\u201cHold on - you  made these? When did you even have time?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAn Addams never reveals her secrets.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid runs her fingers across the hilt of one dagger, noting the tiny raven engraved upon it. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday inclines her head. \u201cMy parents would expect nothing less.\u201d\u00a0\n Her parents. Enid, who\u2019d been floating somewhere along the clouds, falls right back down to earth at the reminder: no matter how much she\u2019d like to pretend it is, none of this is real.\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d she says. \u201cI - thank you. Seriously, this gift is amazing.\u201d She slips the bands around her arms, pulling the knots tight with her teeth before Wednesday can help her; if she wants to have any hope of getting through this night, she needs to reclaim a little space between them. \u201cWe should probably go downstairs, I guess.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday nods. Then, in a move that Enid would never have dreamed possible from her, she offers her elbow in an old-fashioned gesture straight from a classic film. Enid takes it, and the two of them slowly descend the staircase.\u00a0\n--\nThe ballroom looks magical - that\u2019s the first thing Enid notices. This morning it had been nothing special, just another massive room in a massive house, but it\u2019s been transformed since then.\u00a0\nVines of golden flowers line the walls, snaking up towards the vaulted ceiling, and crystal chandeliers shed soft light over the glittering black surface of the dance floor, which is painted with tiny white snowflakes. At the back of the room, a series of black-clothed tables hold food and drink; at the front, a full string orchestra sits ready on a low stage. A black banner bearing the Addams family crest hangs against the back wall, and Enid\u2019s eyes trace the familiar shape of the raven like a habit.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also packed with people. Everywhere Enid looks, she sees another wealthy-looking person in black tie attire. As she looks around, she realizes that she\u2019s one of the only people in the room wearing a color other than black.\u00a0\nHer claws itch at the ends of her fingertips, begging to slide out, and she forces them back. She\u2019s fought a Hyde - she can handle a bunch of rich people.\n\u201cIf you become uncomfortable,\u201d Wednesday murmurs at her side, \u201cjust let me know. I can easily create a diversion.\u201d\nEnid clutches Wednesday\u2019s elbow tightly, her breaths becoming easier. \u201cWhy do I get the feeling that by  diversion  you mean  murder?\u201d\u00a0 \n\u201cYou know me so well.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday, my little scorpion, you look radiant - as do you, Enid.\u201d\u00a0\nGomez and Morticia are standing behind them, linked at the arms, their stance a near-perfect mirror of Wednesday and Enid\u2019s. Gomez is dressed impeccably in yet another suit, while Morticia is wearing a long black gown with a plunging neckline.\u00a0\n\u201cMother,\u201d Wednesday greets. \u201cFather. The decor is suitably depressing.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, this is a great setup,\u201d Enid agrees, \u201cEven better than the Rave\u2019N.\u201d\u00a0\nGomez beams. \u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoy it. Thank you for helping this morning.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd,\u201d Morticia adds, \u201cthank you, Enid, for getting our daughter to actually attend the ball for once instead of hiding in the library.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid raises an eyebrow at Wednesday. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been to it before? It\u2019s literally held in your house.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFestivities are a waste of time. I much preferred my solitary research.\u201d Wednesday scans the room, looking resigned. \u201cHow many people will we have to interact with tonight?\u201d\n\u201cNot too many, if you really want to leave,\u201d Gomez says kindly. \u201cBut the southwest cousins are here, and they would love to meet your paramour.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Wednesday drops Enid\u2019s arm and takes two glasses from the nearest table, passing one to Enid. There\u2019s black liquid inside, with some kind of cold steam rising from it. \u201cThe torture of social interaction isn\u2019t even the enjoyable kind, but we\u2019ll endure it nevertheless.\u201d\n\u201cThey grow up so fast,\u201d Gomez says wistfully, casting an approving glance at the daggers strapped to Enid\u2019s arms. \u201cHave fun tonight, my darlings.\u201d \u00a0 \nAs they walk away, Wednesday looks appalled. \u201cFun? I\u2019d rather perish.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you would.\u201d Enid takes a tentative sip of her drink. It tastes like liquified evil, and she nearly gags. \u201cWhat\u2019s in this?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBlackberry juice, grape wine extract, and trace amounts of belladonna. Do you not want it?\u201d\u00a0\nEnid gladly hands her glass to Wednesday, who downs it in one swallow, then sets it on a table. \u201cI can\u2019t face my extended family without a little poison in my blood.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cUnfortunately, I relate to that.\u201d Enid drags her gaze away from the dark stain of blackberry juice against Wednesday\u2019s bottom lip. \u201cShould we talk to your cousins, then? No matter how bad they are, they can\u2019t be worse than mine.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Wednesday says reluctantly. \u201cI see Second Cousin Hortense over there by the orchestra. He\u2019ll be good for a spot of near-bearable conversation - or, failing that, my first victim of the night.\u201d\u00a0\n--\nAn hour later, Enid\u2019s talked to the new town mayor, the new town mayor\u2019s assistant, four experts in monstrous biology, most of Wednesday\u2019s extended family, and two possibly-convicted poisoners. She\u2019s also had to stop Wednesday from killing one aunt and maiming another.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s been a whirlwind of interaction, one person to the next to the next, but she\u2019s thriving; she\u2019s always been one for building connections, and the light-headed rush that runs through her every time Wednesday presents her as \u201cmy girlfriend, Enid\u201d is a high that will never get old.\u00a0\nWednesday, on the other hand, is visibly tiring of the social scene. She disappeared to the bathroom a couple minutes ago, after promising Enid that she was capable of going alone without committing a violent crime on the way.\u00a0\nSo now Enid\u2019s sitting on a bench at the side of the ballroom, content to watch the crowd while waiting for her return.\u00a0\n\u201cPsst! Enid!\u201d\nEnid looks to her left, where a large fern is waving frantically at her. \u201cUm\u2026hello?\u201d\nThe leaves of the fern part to reveal Pugsley, who\u2019s sitting on the floor behind the pot. \u201cHi. I didn\u2019t mean to startle you, I\u2019m just hiding.\u201d\nEnid nods, sympathetic. \u201cNot into the whole black tie event thing?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Pugsley shudders, gesturing at his tailored black and white suit. \u201cI hate being dressed like this. I feel stupid. Plus, cousin Cain is here and he always bullies me. He tried to drown me in the lake last summer.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Wednesday didn\u2019t kill him?\u201d\n\u201cHis parents intervened before she could complete the job.\u201d A smile quirks at the corner of Pugsley\u2019s mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s still missing a leg, though. See?\u201d He indicates a boy about Enid\u2019s age across the room, who does indeed appear to be missing his right leg.\n\u201cSounds about right,\u201d Enid says. \u201cHe\u2019s lucky Wednesday didn\u2019t do worse, honestly. I saw what she did when a kid cut her in line at breakfast once. It was legit  terrifying.\u201d \nPugsley\u2019s eyes gleam with satisfaction. \u201cI know.\u201d Then, in a less bloodthirsty tone: \u201cHey, look, I just wanted to say - I\u2019m glad you\u2019re Wednesday\u2019s girlfriend. You\u2019re really cool.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s suddenly overcome by a wave of affection, and she has to fight the urge to ruffle his hair. \u201cAw, Pugsley. That\u2019s so sweet of you to say.\u201d\n\u201cPlus,\u201d Pugsley adds, crushing a fern leaf between his fingers. \u201cWednesday\u2019s a lot less mean when she\u2019s in love.\u201d\nAgainst her will, Enid\u2019s heart leaps wildly in her chest. Pugsley doesn\u2019t know the truth; he doesn\u2019t see the whole puzzle, only the pieces they\u2019ve given him. There\u2019s no reason for him to believe that Enid and Wednesday aren\u2019t a real couple, which means there\u2019s no reason for Enid to have hope - and yet, and yet, and yet. \u201cWednesday\u2019s not - I mean, do you really think so?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, pretty much,\u201d Pugsley says. \u201cWhat, haven\u2019t you guys figured that part out yet?\u201d\n\u201cI - \u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve returned,\u201d Wednesday announces. \u201cPlotting behind my back?\u201d\nPugsley shakes his head furiously. Enid manages a wink. \u201cJust a little bonding.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s eyes narrow suspiciously, but she lets it go. \u201cI came to tell you that the dancing is about to start. Pugsley, if you want to escape, there\u2019s a clear route through the kitchens right now.\u201d\nPugsley nods gratefully, then disappears behind the fern again. Wednesday turns her attention back to Enid. \u201cWas he bothering you?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, of course not. We\u2019re besties.\u201d Enid raises a teasing eyebrow. \u201cHe might just be my favorite Addams now. After Thing, of course.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cA questionable choice,\u201d Wednesday says immediately, a touch of something unreadable - annoyance? distaste? - in her voice. \u201cHe has the strength of a wet blanket, and he didn\u2019t learn to throw a blade until he was ten years old.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday,\u201d Enid laughs. Behind them, a swell of lively music rises from the strings of the orchestra. \u201cIt was a joke. So, are you going to ask me to dance or what?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday rolls her eyes, motions over her shoulder. Enid follows, letting Wednesday lead her onto the dance floor. As they slide into the middle of the crowd, she has a vivid memory of the last time she saw Wednesday dancing: at the Rave\u2019N, under the pale blue lights, so close to Tyler that it had made Enid\u2019s chest ache in inexplicable ways.\u00a0\nBut this is not then, and now Wednesday\u2019s looking only at Enid: narrow gaze, intent focus. Anyone at Nevermore would flee if Wednesday looked at them like this, but Enid sees right to the heart of it - what it really means, when it comes down to it, is that Wednesday only sees her.\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s dance, then,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know  el baile folcl\u00f3rico?\u201d\u00a0 \nEnid blinks, sensing that her extensive knowledge of K-pop stage choreography isn\u2019t going to help her tonight. \u201cI\u2019ve never even heard of it, actually, but I\u2019d love to learn.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ll pick it up quickly,\u201d Wednesday tells her. \u201cYou\u2019re not entirely incompetent.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid grins. \u201cNo one would believe it if I told them how sappy you\u2019ve become now that you\u2019re in a relationship. A fake relationship, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cThese accusations are intolerable, and more importantly, baseless. If you don\u2019t retract them immediately, I can\u2019t be responsible for what happens to you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNope. You\u2019re not beating the allegations.\u201d Enid glances over to see what everyone else is doing and realizes that they\u2019re lining up neatly, facing front. \u201cJust so you know, I  really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore Wednesday can answer, the music strikes up once, twice, and the dance floor comes alive in a flurry of movement. Enid is hopelessly lost right from the first step, but Wednesday\u2019s there: a guide, a map. Enid stops worrying and lets go of everything, focusing on the girl in front of her and nothing else.\u00a0\nWednesday turns back just for a moment, and their eyes meet. Enid knows she should look away. She doesn\u2019t.\u00a0\n--\nThe night goes on, and so does the dancing - the dances shift through years and moods and cultures, from tango to foxtrot to allemande to paso doble. Enid\u2019s legs are starting to ache, and she\u2019s sure she looks stupid, but she doesn\u2019t care. She hasn\u2019t had this much fun on a dance floor for years. Even if the Rave\u2019N hadn\u2019t been interrupted by a scene ripped straight from  Carrie, she wouldn\u2019t have considered it half as fun as tonight.\u00a0\nOf course, that has a lot to do with the fact that Wednesday is a far better date than Ajax was.\u00a0\nCase in point: Wednesday knows the steps to every dance like the back of her hand. It\u2019s a stark contrast to the way she danced at the Rave\u2019N, which Enid remembers as a graceless yet stunning performance that slightly resembled the dancing men outside car dealerships.\u00a0\nHere on her home turf, Wednesday moves through the steps of each dance like she was born to do it. Somehow, Enid\u2019s not surprised; she assumes that ballroom dancing, like fencing, composing, and dead language translation, was part of Wednesday\u2019s unconventional upbringing.\u00a0\nThe song ends with a flourish, and Enid realizes that she\u2019s been falling behind. She steps back and yelps as she stumbles right into another body.\u00a0\n\u201cEasy there,\u201d Wednesday says, catching her neatly and setting her back on her feet. \u201cOf all the casualties I was hoping to see tonight, you strangely aren\u2019t one of them.\u201d\nEnid\u2019s about to reply when the music starts up again, this time a slow waltz. All around them, people begin to break off into pairs.\u00a0\nWednesday glances around, disgust written plainly across her face. Enid quirks an eyebrow at her. \u201cReady to take a break? I know you\u2019d rather tear your eyes out, or pull your fingernails off, or something equally horrible, than slow dance with me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThose are all true statements,\u201d Wednesday nods. \u201cThen again, dancing a waltz would be more effective torture than all of those things combined, and I value nothing if not efficiency.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, you lost me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m saying I\u2019ll dance with you,\u201d Wednesday grits out. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t clear.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s mouth opens, closes, opens again. \u201cYou\u2019ll\u2026dance? A  slow dance?  With  me?\u201d\u00a0 \n\u201cMake me repeat it and the only dance I\u2019ll be doing is atop your grave.\u201d Wednesday holds out one hand, her fingers loose in the space between them: no expectation, just an offering.\u00a0\nEnid waits for a heartbeat, thinks of every moment they\u2019ve passed through to get to this one - the fights and the crypt and the tape on the floor, the nights of regret and the hug at the end of the world. She thinks of the very first day she saw Wednesday walk through the door and felt, suddenly and unmistakably, like there was something about this new girl that was going to be special.\u00a0\nShe thinks of all this, and then she takes Wednesday\u2019s hand.\u00a0\nWednesday pulls her closer, and it\u2019s just like it was on the frozen lake: Wednesday leading, Enid following. The music swells, and they keep dancing - and as Enid spins them around, taking over the lead position, an unexpected sense of peace washes over her. Everything becomes clear.\u00a0\nShe sees now, with a clarity that\u2019s both startling and calming, that everything will work itself out. She\u2019s in love with Wednesday, and maybe she always will be, and maybe she\u2019ll hurt over it until she thinks she just might bleed to death, but in the end she\u2019ll get through it; she\u2019ll get through it, because Wednesday is too important to lose. As long as Enid has her in some way, that will be enough.\u00a0\nAnd then Wednesday drops Enid\u2019s hands abruptly and steps back.\u00a0\n\u201cThis was a mistake,\u201d she says, her voice as cold and indifferent as it was on the day they met. \u201cYou need to leave.\u201d\u00a0\nShe turns on her heel, pushes through the crowd - and then she\u2019s gone, and Enid is alone on the dance floor, staring at the space left in her absence. The music swells louder, but she doesn\u2019t hear it.\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday,\u201d Enid murmurs, uncomprehending. Then, louder, shoving her way past black-suited partygoers:  \u201c  Wednesday!  Wait!\u201d\u00a0 \n--\nWednesday isn\u2019t hard to find, in the end. She\u2019s standing on the terrace outside the ballroom, her figure a tiny black silhouette against the night. Enid slides open the tall glass doors and steps out onto the terrace, walking over to join her at the railing. It\u2019s cold out, but she barely feels it.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Enid says slowly. \u201cDo you want to explain what the hell that was?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday doesn\u2019t look at her. \u201cThis endeavor was a mistake from the very beginning. I\u2019ll have Lurch take you to the airport tonight.\u201d\nIt\u2019s like a hammer blow to Enid\u2019s chest. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll reimburse you for the change of flight, of course.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Enid says. It comes out more like a growl. \u201cWednesday, I don\u2019t want your money. That\u2019s the last thing on my mind right now.\u201d\n\u201cWell then,\u201d Wednesday says, her voice like a door slamming closed. \u201cThat\u2019s settled, then. We\u2019re done here.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDone?\u201d Enid echoes, a hysterical rage building in her throat. \u201cYou think we\u2019re  done? Just like that? Wednesday, you\u2019ve got to be fucking kidding me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI apologize for any inconvenience this causes you,\u201d Wednesday says, toneless. It\u2019s far more than she gave Enid the first time they fought, back at Nevermore all those months ago, but the apology lands flat in the face of every barrier they\u2019ve broken down since then. Enid\u2019s blood runs hot with anger and something sharper: hurt.\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says, stepping closer to Wednesday now - they\u2019re past boundaries, past black tape down the center of the floor. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t get to do this. You invited me here, in case you forgot.  You  invited  me, and you asked me to be your fake girlfriend, and I said yes because apparently I\u2019m an idiot who will never, ever learn, but you know what? You don\u2019t get to ask me to come here and do all this and then just cut me loose the second it gets to be too much. I thought we were past this, but I guess not.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday stands still, says nothing.\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday, please,\u201d Enid says, softer now, her voice breaking despite itself. \u201cJust tell me what I did wrong.\u201d\nStill nothing. Wednesday\u2019s face is dark and shadowed, the most unreadable it\u2019s ever been, and Enid feels the ache of loss like a snapped rib in her chest.\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d she snaps, her heart hardening again. \u201cWe\u2019re done here, then. Don\u2019t ever fucking talk to me again. I\u2019ll find a new roommate next semester.\u201d\u00a0\nShe turns to go, swiping angrily at the hot tears that crowd at the corners of her eyes, and then pauses. There\u2019s a sound echoing in her ears, the rhythm faster than she\u2019s ever heard it before but as familiar to her as the back of Wednesday\u2019s hand.\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s heartbeat, racing strong with the breakneck speed of a lie.\u00a0\n\u201cI know you\u2019re hiding something from me,\u201d Enid says, still facing away from Wednesday. \u201cI can hear your heart now, remember.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s heartbeat instantly slows, but it\u2019s enough of an admission. Enid lingers a moment longer, hoping against hope that she\u2019ll say something and end this misery for the both of them, but nothing comes. Slowly, she begins walking away again.\u00a0\n\u201cEnid,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cWait. I asked you to leave because I - \u201d\u00a0\nEnid whips around, glaring through the unshed tears. \u201cBecause you  what,  Wednesday  ?\u201d\u00a0 \n\u201cBecause I can\u2019t stand to be around you anymore.\u201d\u00a0\nIf her chest ached before, it\u2019s nothing compared to now - Enid feels Wednesday\u2019s words like a silver arrow to the heart. She presses one hand to her chest on instinct, surprised when it comes away clean. \u201cGood to know how you really feel about me, then. Don\u2019t worry - I\u2019ll never make the mistake of darkening your doorstep again, here or at Nevermore.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wednesday says, frustrated. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I mean. I can\u2019t stand to be around you anymore because every time you\u2019re near, I feel far too much. It\u2019s unbearable.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid takes one step closer, a tiny flower of hope blooming in her chest. \u201cWhat does it feel like?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt feels,\u201d Wednesday says, \u201clike I\u2019m dying in a way that\u2019s hellish and heavenly all at once. It feels like an illness for which there is no cure.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWednesday,\u201d Enid says, slow and barely comprehending. \u201cWhat are you - \u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI used to despise you,\u201d Wednesday continues. \u201cI used to look across the room at you and your lights and your colors and plot the ways I\u2019d pass your death off as an accident. Now I look at you and I picture our bones resting together in a grave dug for two. Every time you smile at me, I think I would rip my cold black heart from its cavity in my chest and hand it to you if ever you asked. I asked you to leave because I can neither live nor die in peace knowing that our relationship was never real and never will be.\u201d\nEnid\u2019s own heartbeat drowns out the world, beating like thunder in her ears as hope floods her body like moonlight on the lake. \u201cHold on. Are you saying you like me? Like, you have feelings for me?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t experience  feelings,\u201d  Wednesday says. \u201cBut things have indubitably changed. I loathed your touch, and now I crave it with a desperate hunger. I found you intolerable, and now all I want is to tolerate you. I died and came back to life, and still the person I feared for most was you. Against all odds and completely against my will you have become the person closest to my heart, and I cannot bear it alone. I would rather die all over again than bear it alone.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Enid says, half-choked by the joy that\u2019s rising in her throat. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026Wednesday, I like you too. I like you so much. I never wanted this to be fake.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday blinks. \u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI pretended it was real,\u201d Enid admits. \u201cAll the damn time.\u201d\nThey stand there for a moment, two steps apart like they\u2019re still separated by the black tape line running through their room at Nevermore. Then, slowly and deliberately, Wednesday steps forward until they\u2019re close enough to touch.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think this could happen,\u201d she says: quiet, prayer-like. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe I\u2019d ever be capable of wanting someone like this.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBut you are,\u201d Enid says, more a question than a statement.\u00a0\n\u201cI am,\u201d Wednesday confirms. \u201cAnd then, after that realization - I didn\u2019t believe someone like you was capable of wanting someone like me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI am,\u201d Enid says, breathless. \u201cI am. I do.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s eyes meet hers, brown against blue. She\u2019s breathtaking, like deep sea and midnight and the dark side of every wish that Enid\u2019s ever made. Enid loves her more than all the colors in the world.\u00a0\n\u201cGoody told me I was destined to be alone,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I want to be anymore. If I\u2019m enough - if you want me - I\u2019m yours.\u201d\u00a0\nA smile breaks across Enid\u2019s face, bright and joyful and bigger than the whole sky. It\u2019s not midnight yet, but she doesn\u2019t care. She\u2019s tired of waiting, and besides, they\u2019ve never been much for convention anyway. This conversation is a love letter writing itself, folding carefully in thirds between them; Enid steps closer, says \u201cWednesday, I\u2019ve wanted you since the day we met,\u201d and seals it with a kiss as the snow begins to fall again.\n--\nEnid wakes up the next morning to a clumsy but gentle touch at her shoulder. She yawns, her eyes still blurred with sleep, and discovers that Wednesday\u2019s curled into her side like a cat.\u00a0\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Enid says intelligently, her heart beating double-time at the realization that Wednesday\u2019s lying half on top of her. \u201cIs it airport time?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNot quite yet,\u201d Wednesday answers. Her hair is down, hanging in long black waves; it\u2019s the first time Enid\u2019s ever seen her without braids, and it stirs something like a riot in her chest. \u201cI wanted to take you somewhere first.\u201d\u00a0\nThey dress quickly and quietly, Enid choosing one of Wednesday\u2019s black hoodies to wear over her own sweatpants, and then make their way into the hall. Wednesday leads Enid down an unfamiliar corridor and then up a steep iron staircase that spirals endlessly onward, and Enid\u2019s just about to get her claws out when a trap door pops open above her head and light rains down on her.\u00a0\nWednesday pulls herself up, then extends a hand down. Enid takes it, and suddenly she\u2019s on top of the astronomy tower.\u00a0\nShe turns in a circle, taking in the view. Up here, everything is visible: the vast grounds of the manor sprawl in every direction, sweeping downwards to the large black stain of the lake. Farther out, past the trees, Enid can see the brown and red rooftops of the town like faint smudges against the dark grey of the morning sky.\u00a0\nWednesday sits down near the parapet. Enid sits next to her, shoulder to shoulder, and the two of them look out over the roof of the world.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is my favorite place,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cAs a child, I used to come up here and calculate the velocity at which I\u2019d impact the ground if I jumped off the top.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid nods, mildly concerned. \u201cWell, that\u2019s disturbing.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cNot really. I always had a contingency plan for survival.\u201d\nEnid presses her body against Wednesday\u2019s, trying to share some warmth with her. Wednesday\u2019s hair falls across her forehead in loose strands, freer than Enid\u2019s ever seen it before; Enid tucks a curl carefully behind her ear.\u00a0\n\u201cI really like your hair like this,\u201d Enid says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Wednesday sniffs. \u201cIt\u2019s too wild; I dislike showing any sign of untidiness.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s free,\u201d Enid counters. \u201cAnd it\u2019s pretty.\u201d\nWednesday just hums - not quite agreement, but not disagreement either. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you how to braid my hair someday. There\u2019s a very specific technique.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Enid smiles. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d\u00a0\nThe sky begins to lighten, sending streaks of pink and white across the horizon. Wednesday\u2019s eyes narrow at the color, but she doesn\u2019t look away.\u00a0\n\u201cRemember,\u201d Wednesday says \u201cwhen I was leaving Nevermore and you asked if I\u2019d forget you?\u201d\nEnid nods, flushed with the memory. \u201cI do. I really thought you might, you know.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI find it preposterous that you could ask that question,\u201d Wednesday says. \u201cIt was impossible then, and it is even more impossible now. Had I been drowned in the River Lethe, my mouth would still remember the taste of yours.\u201d\nThe words come out quiet, all but monotone, and Wednesday\u2019s face remains impassive. Her hand is cold where it touches Enid\u2019s, and her grip is loose around Enid\u2019s fingers. It\u2019s unquestionably the most romantic moment Enid has ever experienced.\u00a0\n\u201cFor someone who doesn\u2019t like love stories,\u201d Enid says, tilting her head until it rests on Wednesday\u2019s shoulder, \u201cyou sure are good at making romantic speeches.\u201d\n\u201cBlame my father. The trait of romance unfortunately runs in the Addams family, no matter how hard I\u2019ve tried to suppress it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s a good trait.\u201d Enid feels Wednesday\u2019s pinky finger curl around hers, a small and wordless gesture, and she smiles. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d find depressing mythological references and morbid desires for mutual death to be romantic - I was always more of a sappy kiss in the rain, boombox outside the window kind of girl - but I can work with this. I think I can work with anything, as long as it\u2019s you.\u201d\nWednesday looks confused. \u201cWhy would I hold a boombox outside your window? I don\u2019t even own one.\u201d\u00a0\n \u201cSay Anything? John Hughes, 1989?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s look of confusion remains predictably unchanged. Enid grins. \u201cOh, we have so many movie nights ahead of us.\u201d\n\u201cStrike me down now,\u201d Wednesday intones, \u201cand spare me from this fate.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Enid tells her. \u201cWe\u2019ll watch one of your black and white surrealist cannibalism movies first. Or one of your horror films. You watched  Mean Girls with me; fair is fair.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday looks satisfied. Enid tries not to wince at the thought of whatever terrifying movie she\u2019s going to pick first.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re returning to school in a week,\u201d Wednesday says after a minute. \u201cHave you given any thought to the continuation of our status as roommates? I, for one, see no reason to ruin a good thing by making changes.\u201d\n\u201cUh, duh,\u201d Enid replies. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be great. We\u2019ll be roomies  and  girlfriends.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s body goes tense. \u201cGirlfriends?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Enid says, trying to backtrack. \u201cUm. No. Didn\u2019t mean to say that. I mean, I don\u2019t want to assume anything.\u201d\nWednesday makes a pained expression - the kind Enid knows means she\u2019s thinking, because when she\u2019s in real pain she\u2019s usually smiling. Then she says, halting but sure: \u201cI\u2019m not totally opposed to the idea.\u201d\u00a0\nA rush of happiness explodes in Enid\u2019s chest. \u201cWow. Yeah. Okay. Howdy, girlfriend.\u201d\n\u201cNever repeat that phrase.\u201d\n\u201cGotcha.\u201d\u00a0\nThe sky turns lighter, streaks of orange bleeding into the pink. Enid watches, content down to her very bones. She\u2019s sitting on a rooftop with Wednesday Addams, and they\u2019re alive and whole and Wednesday isn\u2019t trying to murder her for holding her hand, and this is pretty much every one of Enid\u2019s wildest dreams come to life.\u00a0\nHer mother will absolutely  hate  Wednesday. Deep down, some part of Enid can\u2019t wait until the day they meet.\u00a0\nShe sets the thought aside, though. That\u2019s a problem for future Enid; right now, present Enid is the only one that matters.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI wonder if Nevermore will chill out a little this semester,\u201d Enid says, stroking her thumb gently across the back of Wednesday\u2019s hand and reveling in the sound of Wednesday\u2019s heartbeat racing at the touch. \u201cI think most of the students could use a good normal school year.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure it will be positively chaotic,\u201d Wednesday says. Her lips turn up at the corners, curling into a dangerous smile that takes Enid\u2019s breath away. \u201cAnd I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\nEnid raises her head and turns her face towards the sun, letting her scars lie in full light. It\u2019s a new year and a new beginning, and there\u2019s no one in this life or the next she\u2019d rather spend it with; the return to school could be mundane or murderous, but as long as she has Wednesday by her side, she\u2019s unafraid.\u00a0\nCome what may, she\u2019s unafraid.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she says, leaning into Wednesday\u2019s shoulder, love blooming like a garden in her chest. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it, too.\u201d\u00a0"
