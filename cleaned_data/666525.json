    "text": "\u00a0\u00a0Derek Morgan had been in a lot of bad situations in his life, from finding himself speechless at his father\u2019s funeral to the unspeakable things which had poisoned his adolescence to being put under the infallible microscope otherwise known as Aaron Hotchner when he was late for a meeting. He liked to think he could deal with almost anything life threw at him. Not necessarily easily, not even always well, but he could deal.\n\u00a0\u00a0 For instance: he could deal with being trapped by a cave-in. He was uninjured, he had space and air and some level of light, and Hotch knew more or less where he was and would probably have him freed within a few hours, a day at the most. He wasn\u2019t even worried. Not looking forward to spending an indeterminate amount of time covered in whatever it was that had exploded and caused the cave-in in the first place, but not worried.\n\u00a0\u00a0 He could deal with having lost track of Reid. He wasn\u2019t happy about it, and his brain kept cycling through all the things that happened to the kid when he was out of sight or even when he was right there in front of him but just beyond his reach, but he wasn\u2019t panicking. Reid was too smart for anyone\u2019s good and way stronger than he looked. No matter what, he would, eventually, be fine, or as fine as he ever was. And probably, hopefully, he was fine right now, so Derek wasn\u2019t going to worry about that yet.\n\u00a0\u00a0 He could even deal with Dean Winchester pointing a loaded gun at his head. Talking down armed psychopaths was part of his job, after all. Of course, usually he had backup. And usually it wasn\u2019t his own gun which was being aimed at him.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Also, he usually wasn\u2019t dealing with all three of those things at the same time.\n\u00a0-----------------\n\n\u00a0\n24 hours earlier:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAlright, Hotch, what\u2019s so important you had to drag us in on a Saturday night?\u201d Rossi asked what everyone was thinking. \u201cI\u2019ve got a half-finished lasagna in my fridge.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Morgan had been half-finished with something else entirely, but the next words out of Hotch\u2019s mouth drove all thought of that from his mind.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Winchesters are back.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 The screen blinked to life, displaying two mug shots, both young Caucasian men. One in his mid-to-late-twenties, short hair, blatantly irreverent; the other a few years younger, long hair, looking resigned and vaguely embarrassed as if he and his brother had been arrested for public indecency and not several counts of murder. Both were handsome, and pages and pages of witness reports, school records, and other documents said that they were intelligent, charismatic, and resourceful.\n\u00a0\u00a0 They also said they were dead.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA sighting was reported in a diner in Kentucky, just outside of Mammoth Caves National Park. A security camera outside a nearby bank confirmed it,\u201d Hotch explained. \u201cIt appears that they faked their deaths. None of the remains from the police station explosion could be positively identified, so it is quite possible that the Winchesters escaped beforehand or even caused the explosion themselves.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFire has been used in the past as a forensic countermeasure to prevent accurate body identification in the past,\u201d Reid offered. \u201cIn 1994 Marine staff sergeant Arthur Bennett burned his trailer with a body inside after he was charged with child molestation. The fraud wasn\u2019t discovered until three years later, during which time he continued to prey on children under an assumed identity.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0What happened to the police station in Colorado hadn\u2019t been so much a fire as an impossibly contained nuclear explosion, but nobody mentioned that.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat about these two?\u201d Prentiss questioned, nodding at the screen. \u201cWhat have they been doing all this time?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBy the looks of it? Everything,\u201d Penelope answered. \u201cWhen Hotch told me they might be back I crosschecked their prints with old cases, things in smaller towns which wouldn\u2019t be hooked up to the national database, and let me tell you, these boys have been busy.\u201d A flick of her fingers and the image on the screen changed, the mug shots replaced by crime scene photos. A man with multiple knife-wounds sprawled in a motel room, a living room furnished with a body charred beyond recognition, a young woman shot in the stomach on a wooden floor.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cM.O. and victimology are all over the place,\u201d said JJ, flicking through the files. \u201cThere are women shot, men stabbed, visa versa, lawyers, bartenders \u2013 some are quick and clean, others have obviously been tortured \u2013 am I reading this right?\u201d she asked, frowning at her tablet. \u201cThis woman was exsanguinated, and they couldn\u2019t account for most of her blood?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah,\u201d said Penelope with a grimace. \u201cThe theory is that they, uh, drank it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot \u2018they,\u2019 he,\u201d corrected Derek. \u201cOnly Sam\u2019s fingerprints were found at the scene.\u201d His stomach turned as he went even farther back in the records. These two had stabbed a middle-aged couple to death with their own Christmas tree. In what twisted delusion did that make any sort of sense?\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWasn\u2019t he supposed to be the submissive, bent under his brother\u2019s oppressive thumb of sadism?\u201d Rossi asked dryly.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s always the quiet ones,\u201d Prentiss muttered.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re operating on the assumption that all previous profiles are wrong,\u201d Hotch said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be building a new one from scratch. Wheels up in thirty. These guys move fast. We have to move faster.\u201d\n\u00a0---------------\n\u00a0Present moment:\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPut the gun down,\u201d Derek said, in the most reasonable voice he could manage.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy the fuck would I do that?\u201d Dean snapped back, and began to call for his brother without waiting for a response. \u201cSam? Can you hear me? Sammy!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 There was muffled groan on Derek\u2019s right, from what appeared, in the small amount of sunlight which filtered into the cavern, to be a solid wall of rock.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDude, you don\u2019t have to shout,\u201d came Sam Winchester\u2019s voice, slightly impeded by the rock but easily understandable.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou okay?\u201d Dean demanded.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCan\u2019t see a damn thing, but yeah, I think so. You?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFine. We\u2019ve got some light over here, but the entrance is stopped up pretty good. Doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re going anywhere.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2018We\u2019?\u201d Sam repeated.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, one of the feds is in here with me,\u201d Dean told him, shooting a glare at Derek. \u201cI got his gun off him.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Derek tensed, waiting for the inevitable \u2018so shoot him already\u2019 \u2013 but it never came.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat about him, is he okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Derek spoke up, not shifting his gaze from the older Winchester and trying not to show how much the question surprised him. \u201cMy name\u2019s Derek Morgan. I\u2019m with the Behavioral Analysis Unit.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, well, wish I could say it was nice to meet you,\u201d said Sam, while Dean rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you know who we are.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou guess right,\u201d Derek replied, and he couldn\u2019t suppress the rage which roiled up in him as he thought of exactly what he knew. The owner of that deep, slightly sheepish voice had tied down a pediatric nurse, put his mouth to her severed artery, and drank her dry.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Dean must have seen the shift, because his gaze hardened. However, whatever he might have said was forestalled by a sudden, urgent \u201cDean.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat is it, Sammy?\u201d Jerking to attention like a guard dog, every nerve instantly alert. There was that infamous protective instinct. Dangerous, irrational, codependent.\n\u00a0\u00a0 From this angle he just looked like a worried big brother.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s someone else in here.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Derek\u2019s heart leapt into his throat. Reid.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReid!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShut up,\u201d Dean ordered. \u201cSam, are we talking actual someone else?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUm. Yeah. I think so.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 That exchange was an interesting tidbit if it meant what Derek thought it meant, but that really wasn\u2019t what he was concerned about at the moment.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf you hurt him \u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI said shut up,\u201d Dean growled, grip tightening on the gun. \u201cThat\u2019s the other fed, Sam.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay. Hang on. I\u2019ve got a pulse,\u201d said Sam, and Derek let out a breath in relief. \u201cHe\u2019s unconscious and . . . yeah, there\u2019s definitely a head injury, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that bad. He\u2019s waking up.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 There was a moan, then a gasp, and then Reid\u2019s voice.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWha \u2013 what\u2019s \u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReid! Reid, it\u2019s me; it\u2019s Morgan.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMorgan? I \u2013 I can\u2019t see! I can\u2019t \u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d This time it was Sam\u2019s voice, soothing and steady, easily switching roles from confused little brother to calming companion. \u201cThere was a cave-in. You can\u2019t see because it\u2019s dark.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHotch knows where we are,\u201d Derek said. \u201cHe\u2019ll get us out.\u201d It was a message to both Reid and the Winchesters, and judging by the look Dean shot him it was received.\n\u00a0\u00a0 There was a pause, and when Reid spoke again his voice was calmer, though only marginally. Reid was impossibly good at working through his terror. He was terrible at hiding it.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t move my legs and my gun\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have your gun,\u201d came Sam\u2019s voice, still gentle, not remotely threatening. \u201cI\u2019m going to unload it and hand it back to you, okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSam,\u201d said Dean sharply.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDean,\u201d Sam replied exasperatedly. \u201cHe\u2019s concussed, pinned, and it\u2019s pitch black. He\u2019s not going to pistol whip me into submission.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust pinned, Reid?\u201d Derek asked. Confirming that Reid was more or less whole was the most immediate priority. The fact that their profile (never very solid to begin with) was unraveling more and more every minute could wait.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah,\u201d Reid replied tightly. \u201cI can feel everything.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Derek winced. It was better than the alternative, of course, but the kid\u2019s lower half was riddled with old injuries which had to ache something awful, and it would only get worse the longer he was trapped.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd your head?\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI \u2013 I don\u2019t know.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cI was knocked out, so I almost certainly have a concussion, but other than that \u2013 it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s really dark, Morgan.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shit. Derek had forgotten. It seemed like lifetimes ago that they had sat in a cabin in Texas and teased each other about irrational fears. Before Hankel and Foyet and Doyle and dozens of other all-too-real monsters. Maybe Reid\u2019s fear of the dark wasn\u2019t irrational after all.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know, kid,\u201d he said, wishing he could do more, wishing Dean Winchester wasn\u2019t watching him like a hawk, wishing he were on the other side of that wall instead of Sam.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot gonna tell you the dark\u2019s nothing to be scared of,\u201d Dean cut in, \u201c\u2018Cause there\u2019s stuff out there that would make you shit yourself, but we already ganked the one fugly in here, and if there\u2019s anything left it should be scared of us.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 If looks could kill, Derek\u2019s would have incinerated Dean by now. The smirk which curled the other man\u2019s lips said that he knew exactly how unreassuring his little speech was.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDean, shut up,\u201d said Sam. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him,\u201d he continued, to Reid. \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s just being a dick because he\u2019s pissed off.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey!\u201d Dean protested. Sam ignored him. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cReid, is that your first name or your last?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLast. I\u2019m, uh, Dr. Spencer Reid.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay. You\u2019ve hit your head pretty bad, Doctor; you need to keep talking. Can you do that?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI \u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Derek could hear the confusion in his voice, the internal struggle to reconcile the contradictions which were flooding him. Sam Winchester was a dangerous killer. Sam Winchester had surrendered a weapon to him for the sole purpose of making him feel more secure. Sam Winchester was speaking gently and warmly and reprimanding his brother for trying to frighten him.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReid,\u201d Derek said warningly. Many psychopaths were capable of feigning or even feeling compassion. It didn\u2019t mean that they weren\u2019t dangerous. It certainly didn\u2019t mean that Reid should give Sam any more information than he already had about them.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t want to tell us about yourself,\u201d Sam deduced. \u201cThat\u2019s okay; I get that. So tell us about us. You guys are profilers, right? Give us the profile.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDoesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Reid muttered.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Dean snorted. Everyone ignored him.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy not?\u201d Sam prompted. Reid\u2019s words filtered through the rock, stilted at first but building speed as he delved into what was, perhaps, the greatest of his many areas of expertise.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMost killing teams, there\u2019s a clear power dynamic; one partner is partner is completely dominant over the other . . .\u201d\n\u00a0----------------\n\u00a016 hours earlier:\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSam isn\u2019t the submissive,\u201d said Prentiss. \u201cHe can\u2019t be. The only advantage Dean has over him is age. Sam is bigger, academically more intelligent, better educated, just as charismatic \u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s proved that he\u2019s perfectly capable of operating on his own,\u201d Hotch agreed. \u201cHe was the first to escape in Baltimore, and there are whole stretches of time when Dean doesn\u2019t appear to be active at all.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf anything, his crimes are more brutal during those periods,\u201d Reid put in from where he was poring over hard copies of the files which Garcia was still rushing to compile.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCould we have it backwards?\u201d JJ asked. \u201cMaybe Sam\u2019s the sadist and Dean\u2019s just catering to his little brother\u2019s needs. Dean could see it as taking care of him.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut Dean\u2019s clearly an active participant,\u201d Hotch pointed out. \u201cHe was the one who tortured the women in St. Louis, and all the video footage and witness accounts say that he takes the lead when they\u2019re together.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo maybe they\u2019re both dominant personalities,\u201d Derek said, biting back a growl of frustration. The past eight hours had only uncovered a mess of half-baked witness accounts and contradictory evidence. Each new piece of information only made things more confusing.\n\u00a0\u00a0 According to what they had found, Sam had gone from a loving boyfriend who didn\u2019t speak with his dysfunctional family to a mission-oriented killer who would do anything for his brother to a violent sociopath who was into rough sex with married women. Dean was an alcoholic sexual sadist who at one point had spent six months as a middle-class, suburban stepfather without committing a single crime. Not including the police station explosion, both had died at least once.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWait, guys, I think I\u2019ve got something here,\u201d said Reid eagerly. \u201cThe deaths all stop after they leave town, right? But they start before they arrive.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVigilantes?\u201d Prentiss said, her eyebrows rising.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt would explain why the witnesses have been so reluctant to talk to us,\u201d JJ said. \u201cThey\u2019re not scared; they\u2019re indebted.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0--------\n\u00a0Present moment:\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDamn right,\u201d growled Dean. Near the beginning of Reid\u2019s explanation he had lowered the gun and settled onto the ground, warning Derek \u201ctry anything and I\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d Derek had followed suit after a moment of hesitation and now they sat about ten yards apart, leaning against opposite walls of the cave. The gunk which Derek had tried (in vain, with Dean watching him amusedly) to rid himself of was beginning to dry and flake off. The air was still heavy with tension, but it was no longer filled with the electric current of impending homicide.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDean,\u201d Sam chided.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, dammit, I\u2019m not going to sit here and listen to them talk about us like we\u2019re murderers or something!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe are murderers,\u201d Sam answered flatly.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Dean made a face.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, fine; we\u2019re murderers. But we\u2019re not fucking psychos. I don\u2019t get off on this shit, and you\u2019re not a sociopath.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d said Sam, his voice exaggeratedly agreeable. \u201cExcept, y\u2019know, when I was.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, come on, do we really need to go over this again?\u201d Dean questioned rhetorically. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, suddenly addressing Derek. \u201cYou guys are shrinks, right? Settle this for us. If there\u2019s this guy, and he\u2019s kind of you, same body and everything, but he\u2019s not you you \u2013 he\u2019s like, your clone, or your evil twin \u2013 no, you know what he\u2019s like? He\u2019s like Kirk in that one Star Trek episode, when the transporter splits him into two people.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2018The Enemy Within,\u2019\u201d Reid responded. \u201cKirk is split into his \u2018good side\u2019 and his \u2018bad side\u2019. His bad side seeks out hedonistic pleasures and wreaks havoc on the ship while his good side fields the accusations, unaware of the transporter malfunction.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRight,\u201d Dean said firmly. \u201cThe good Kirk had no idea, and once he gets put back together what the bad Kirk did isn\u2019t his fault, because it wasn\u2019t really him.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell \u2013\u201d Reid began, and Derek could sense the upcoming lecture on moral complexities and the philosophy of self, but the young doctor clearly thought better of it. \u201cThat\u2019s a perfectly sound assertion,\u201d he said instead. \u201cAnd it\u2019s worth noting that the \u2018good side\u2019 of Kirk was actually incapable of functioning without his more aggressive \u2018bad side.\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Sam heaved a long-suffering sigh which Derek could hear even though the rock.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShut up, Sam,\u201d Dean said irritably. \u201cYou\u2019re not a sociopath, okay? End of story.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Sam didn\u2019t protest any further, but he didn\u2019t agree, either. Derek got the sense that this argument had occurred more than once. He wondered what it was that had caused the sudden change in behavior Dean was implying (in keeping with what they had managed to piece together). An addiction? A brain injury? Whatever it was, Dean clearly believed it was outside of Sam\u2019s control, and Sam clearly felt differently. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReid, how are you doing?\u201d was all Derek said aloud.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFine,\u201d said Reid, tense but no longer terrified. Apparently, a chance to discuss Star Trek could do wonders for his mood no matter what the situation. \u201cMy head\u2019s clearer.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood,\u201d said Derek. No mention of his knee, which had to be killing him by now (he tried to hide it, but Derek had seen him limping on cold and damp days), but Derek wasn\u2019t going to bring it to his attention if he was trying to ignore it.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The sun was beginning to set, the light which filtered into the cave becoming redder and dimmer.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou got a flashlight?\u201d Dean asked, obviously noticing the same thing.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah,\u201d Derek answered, reaching for it.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no; leave it,\u201d said Dean, reaching into his own pocket. \u201cWe should use \u2018em one at a time,\u201d he explained, withdrawing his own flashlight and flicking it on. \u201cDon\u2019t wanna waste the batteries. Hey, Sam, don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve got your flashlight, do you?\u201d he called to the wall of rock.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, Dean,\u201d came the sarcastic reply. \u201cI\u2019ve been sitting in absolute darkness for the past hour because I like it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay, fine,\u201d said Dean, looking almost comically taken aback. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a bitch about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 The silence stretched. The sunlight was almost entirely gone now, and Derek suppressed a shiver. The temperature was going to drop like a rock. Dean had about five different layers on, and Reid would probably be okay in his sweater vest, but Derek\u2019s t-shirt meant he was in for an uncomfortable night. Judging by Dean\u2019s furrowed brow, he was having similar thoughts and trying to remember what his brother was wearing.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDean.\u201d Sam\u2019s voice had a new note in it, on the verge of shaking and edged with something which wasn\u2019t quite fear, yet. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s getting kind of chilly in here.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Dean closed his eyes for an instant, mouth moving in a silent curse. He shot Derek a glare as if daring him to comment, and then leaned closer to the wall to address his brother, his voice low as if he could keep Derek and Reid from hearing.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen to me, man,\u201d he said. \u201cYou gotta hold it together, okay? We\u2019ll be out of here before you know it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 And into police custody and probably solitary confinement, as Derek was certain they were both well aware, but nobody mentioned it.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah,\u201d Sam agreed, but he didn\u2019t sound as if he believed it. \u201cIt\u2019s just, it feels like . . .\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know,\u201d said Dean, and the pain on his face was so raw and intimate that Derek looked away. \u201cBut you\u2019re not there, Sam. You gotta hold onto that.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 There was only ragged breathing in reply. \u201cYou\u2019re not there.\u201d Flashbacks, it sounded like. PTSD. Maybe the trauma had caused the behavior shift, multiple personalities or some kind of fugue state. Derek wondered what kind of trauma could splinter a man who was so twisted already.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Dean spoke again, this time with an edge of desperation.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou used to be so scared of the dark, remember that, Sammy?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Sam gave a sharp burst of laughter, harsh and verging on hysterical.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, it\u2019s kind of hard to forget Dad shoving a gun into my hands and explaining that the thing in my closet could smell fear.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cC\u2019mon, man,\u201d Dean cajoled, looking pained. \u201cIs that all you remember?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 A pause, and then . . .\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d Sam admitted. \u201cI remember you taking the gun away.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYour hands were shaking so bad I thought you were going to shoot me.\u201d Dean\u2019s face was softening into something wistful, almost nostalgic, and Sam\u2019s voice matched it when he answered. For the first time, Derek felt his stomach twist with pity. What sort of lives had these men had, that they looked back on their hellish childhood with longing?\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou stayed home that weekend and taught me how to shoot, even though Dad was going to let you go to that game.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWorth every minute,\u201d Dean replied, and then his lips curled into a smirk. \u201cThough you\u2019re still a crap shot.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Sam laughed again, more genuine this time.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll remind you of that the next time my crap shooting saves your ass.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBitch.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJerk.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Another beat of silence, and then, more urgent this time, pleading \u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDean.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSam, listen to me, there is no one there. It\u2019s just you and the fed, man.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReid, what\u2019s going on in there?\u201d Derek asked, ignoring the death glare Dean shot him. The gun was lying harmlessly at his side, and Reid\u2019s safety came first.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI \u2013 I think \u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0Sam whimpered, and Reid\u2019s voice shed its uncertainty.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s hallucinating.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Derek swore under his breath.\n\u00a0\u00a0 They had gotten it all wrong.\n\u00a0----------\n\n\u00a0\n4 hours earlier:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo what have we got?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Even Hotch was beginning to look frustrated, now. Derek half expected a hair to fall out of place any minute. After working late into the night, sleeping on it, and working all of the next morning, they had \u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA pair of codependent sociopaths who somehow manage to spend months apart.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn other words, contradictions,\u201d Rossi re-interpreted.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn other words, nothing,\u201d Prentiss growled. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re still here, and even if they are they\u2019re going to blow town sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAlright,\u201d Derek sighed, leaning forward. \u201cSo maybe we\u2019ve been coming at this from the wrong angle. They\u2019re task oriented, right?\u201d he said in response to the circle of questioning looks. \u201cHigh-functioning, completely sane within the rules of their delusion. So if they\u2019re here they\u2019re here for a reason.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo we think like them,\u201d said Prentiss with dawning realization. \u201cWe hunt what they\u2019re hunting.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 The team burst into action with new energy, Hotch dialing Garcia, Reid flipping through files, JJ sticking her head out into the main room of the station \u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGarcia, I need records of all suspicious deaths in the immediate area within the last few months.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA lot of the deaths the Winchesters follow actually aren\u2019t murders; most of them seem to be freak accidents and animal attacks \u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSheriff, has anything unusual been happening around here lately? Anything that\u2019s made the papers?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell,\u201d said the Sheriff thoughtfully. \u201cCouple people got killed by a coyote or somethin\u2019 up in the park. Happens, I guess, but not often it\u2019s fatal. Ranger\u2019s the one to talk to about that.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMorgan, Reid, you go to ranger station, see if anyone\u2019s been asking around,\u201d Hotch ordered. \u201cPrentiss and I will head down to the morgue. Everyone else see what they can dig up here.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cC\u2019mon, Pretty Boy,\u201d said Derek, ruffling Reid\u2019s hair as he passed. \u201cI\u2019m driving.\u201d\n\u00a0----------\n\nPresent moment:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, Sammy,\u201d Dean said, almost too low for Derek to hear. Sam had stopped responding several minutes ago, and now Dean sat slumped with his forehead pressed against the rock, repeating his brother\u2019s name like prayer. \u201cSam, Sam, dammit Sammy . . .\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStop it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Sam\u2019s voice was flat and so sudden that Dean jerked in surprise and gave a hiss of pain as his skin scraped against rock.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSammy!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI said stop it,\u201d Sam said, still toneless. \u201cI\u2019m not falling for it again. He\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d Dean whispered. The flashlight threw the lines of pain and horror on his face into stark relief. \u201cNo, dammit! Listen to me, Sammy, you are not in the Cage. It\u2019s just some cave. You\u2019re not. In. The Cage. I got you out, Sammy. I got you out.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Sam let out an empty, mirthless sound which might have been a laugh.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFuck you,\u201d he said, with more exhaustion than venom, and then fell silent again.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Dean choked back a sob. There was a beat of heavy silence. Dean\u2019s eyes cut to Derek, and that was all the warning he had before his own gun was once again pointed at his face.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHelp him,\u201d Dean ordered, despair burned away by fury, voice hard and eyes harder.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMorgan?\u201d Reid questioned sharply. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re going to help my brother,\u201d Dean responded, eyes never wavering from Derek, \u201cor I\u2019m going to put a bullet through your friend\u2019s head.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Reid,\u201d said Derek evenly, keeping very still. For all the confusion and contradictions which surrounded the Winchesters, one thing was still clear: Dean was never more dangerous than when Sam was in trouble. \u201cIt\u2019s a flashback. Try to talk him out of it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 It was clearly more than a flashback, and even if it weren\u2019t, Sam was so deeply entrenched that it was probably too late to do anything but wait it out. Derek knew that, and he knew that Reid knew it, too, and he suspected that beneath his rage, so did Dean. But Derek\u2019s gaze remained steady, and so did Dean\u2019s aim.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Reid\u2019s voice didn\u2019t, quite. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSam? Can you hear me? I \u2013 I don\u2019t know where you think you are, but I promise you, it\u2019s only a memory. You\u2019re in Mammoth Cave National Park, Kentucky.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 There was a pause which seemed to stretch for ages, and then \u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho\u2019s that supposed to be?\u201d Sam\u2019s voice was still dead and hollow, but at least he was responding.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDr. Spencer Reid. I\u2019m with the FBI\u2019s Behavioral Analysis Unit.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c. . . what?\u201d asked Sam, seemingly startled out of whatever stupor he had fallen into.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m with the FBI. We\u2019ve been looking for you and your brother.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMe and my . . . you mean . . . Adam?\u201d Sam asked, confusion clear in his voice. Dean flinched.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho\u2019s Adam?\u201d Reid asked.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI \u2013 he\u2019s \u2013 he\u2019s the only other \u2013 Dean isn\u2019t here,\u201d Sam insisted. \u201cHe not, he\u2019s alive, he got out \u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, he did,\u201d Reid agreed. \u201cAnd so did you. You\u2019re in Mammoth Cave National Park, Sam.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMammoth Cave . . . Kentucky? But \u2013 there was \u2013 what \u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Derek could hear the realization dawning. Dean still stood tense as a bowstring, as though afraid to let himself hope.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCan you remember?\u201d Reid prompted.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe were hunting a . . . a Wendigo. But it was \u2013 sick, or something, not finishing off its kills. Dean \u2013\u201d He faltered. Dean stood frozen, barely breathing. Sam started again, stronger. \u201cDean made some stupid pun about bad apples, but it must have actually eaten something weird, because it was super slow, barely even faster than a human, and when we shot it \u2013 it . . . exploded.\n\u00a0\u201cAnd . . .\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere was a cave-in.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201c. . . Dean?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Dean sagged, the gun falling back to his side, and what washed over his face was more than relief, more than love, more than any combination of the two.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m here, Sammy.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDean,\u201d Sam repeated, and his voice matched his brother\u2019s face. \u201cHow long . . .?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot long,\u201d Dean replied, sinking back down against the other side of the cave, walls sliding back into place. \u201cFifteen, twenty minutes.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay,\u201d said Sam. \u201cOkay. Sorry. And thank you, Dr. Reid. You doing alright?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah,\u201d Reid answered. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Silence threatened again, but Sam spoke before it could overtake them, his voice shaky and very young. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDean. Could you \u2013 could it not be quiet? Please.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, Sam. Of course,\u201d said Dean. He forced a smile, as if he\u2019d forgotten that his brother couldn\u2019t see him (or as if he knew his brother could sense it anyway). \u201cJust remember you asked for it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Derek let his head fall back to the sound of Dean Winchester vocalizing AC/DC guitar riffs and his brother laughing softly. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 He wondered if this could get any more surreal.\n\u00a0----------\n\nThree hours earlier:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Derek and Reid pulled up to the ranger\u2019s station and were greeted with the sight of a classic car glinting in the afternoon sunlight.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat look like a \u201967 Chevy Impala to you?\u201d \u00a0Derek asked darkly as he parked. Reid opened his mouth, but caught himself and closed it again. The kid was improving.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Communicating in looks and gestures, they advanced on the small structure, drawing their weapons as they moved. Derek kicked the door in without hesitation \u2013 and found a single room, empty save for a very startled ranger.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere did they go?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNorth,\u201d the ranger answered. \u201cTowards the caves. It\u2019s not far.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Derek glanced at Reid. They both knew how dangerous it was to go after an UnSub without backup, let alone two, let alone the Winchesters. They also knew that if they didn\u2019t go after them now, chances were the brothers would be tearing a red path across the country again within the next hour.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Reid set his jaw and gave a small nod. Derek shifted his grip on his weapon.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\u00a0----------\n\nPresent moment:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCan you hear that?\u201d Dean questioned abruptly, cutting himself off in the middle of You Shook Me All Night Long. Derek pulled himself upright and listened. It was distant and faint, but getting louder . . .\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMorgan! Reid!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u201cAgent Morgan!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u201cDr. Reid!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOver here!\u201d Derek called, springing to his feet. \u201cHotch! Over here!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 (\u201cDean? What\u2019s happening?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe other feds are here, Sammy. They\u2019re gonna dig us out.\u201d)\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMorgan!\u201d Hotch\u2019s voice was much closer now, flashlights visible through the thin gaps in the rock. \u201cThey\u2019re over here!\u201d he called back to the others, before addressing Derek again.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMorgan, is Reid with you?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah. He\u2019s banged up and pinned, but he\u2019s fine. We both are.\u201d He paused, glancing at Dean, who waved his hand in an exasperated \u2018well, go ahead\u2019 motion. \u201cThe Winchesters are here. Uninjured. Dean\u2019s armed.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Dean climbed to his feet, holding up Derek\u2019s gun with his finger held away from the trigger.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m unloading the gun and sliding it over to your man now,\u201d he said, to Hotch, his eyes on Derek. He did as he said, pocketing the magazine. \u201cNow mine,\u201d he continued, pulling another gun from where it was tucked at the small of his back, still carefully nonthreatening. He performed the same operation with this one, though he was obviously more reluctant to give it up.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAlright, Hotch,\u201d Derek said, holstering his own gun and stowing Dean\u2019s as the Winchester had. \u201cGet us out of here.\u201d\n\u00a0----------\n\u00a0\u00a0 It took twenty minutes for the slapdash task force to clear away the stone from the main entrance. Dean accepted the handcuffs which were immediately slapped onto him without even a token protest, only insisting (demanding, proclaiming, pleading) \u201cYou don\u2019t take me anywhere until you get Sam out.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 Hotch glanced at Derek, met his eyes, and allowed Dean to stay.\n\u00a0\u00a0 It took another hour to get Sam out. He cried out in something which sounded a lot like pure terror when the first beam of light hit his eyes and flinched from the hands which reached to pull him out, but allowed himself to be handcuffed and led over to his brother. When they finally caught sight of each other it was as if they\u2019d been separated for years rather than hours. It looked as though it physically pained them that they were still unable to touch.\n\u00a0\u00a0 After that, Derek was thoroughly occupied with Reid\u2019s extraction, which took longer as they struggled to free him without causing any damage to his pinned lower half. At last they managed it, and he hobbled out, stiff and wincing but fine, fine, just fine. He leaned against Derek\u2019s shoulder on the way back to the ranger\u2019s station, and laughed breathlessly.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhen we get back to the hotel,\u201d he panted. \u201cI am turning on every light in the room.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 By the morning, the Winchesters had long since been transferred. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0----------\n\u00a0\u00a0 They got the call three days later. After a grand total of sixty-five hours in high security solitary confinement, the Winchesters had escaped. Again. No one had any idea how they did it. It seemed that Dean had spent the entire time pacing back and forth and cursing between demands to see his brother, while Sam alternated between sitting tense and terrified, flinching at nothing, and slumping exhaustedly against the wall, eyes closed, repeating something in Latin over and over again. The guards assumed that it was some sort of demonic chant, but Reid took a look at the tape and said,\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s Pater Noster. The Our Father.\u201d His eyes were a swirling mess of emotions as he looked to Derek, who spoke through the inexplicable tightness in his throat.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe was praying.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 The Winchesters left no trace behind, nor did the unidentified bearded man who apparently had some hand in the escape. Not even cold, the trail was nonexistent. All they could do was wait for another sighting \u2013 and somehow, Derek doubted they would get one. The Winchesters\u2019 faces had been plastered across every television in the country before and no one had reported them. It was as if the entire population had a psychological block preventing them from seeing anything but two charming young men when they looked at them.\n\u00a0\u00a0 (Reid had expounded at length on something called a Perception Filter. One of the local cops had put it more succinctly.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t know if it\u2019s God, the Devil, or what,\u201d he had said with a shake of his head which was half disgust and half awe. \u201cThem boys\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 looking out for \u2018em.\u201d)\n\u00a0\u00a0The Winchesters were long gone.\n\u00a0\u00a0 For many reasons, a number of which he didn\u2019t care to examine, Derek hoped he never saw them again."
