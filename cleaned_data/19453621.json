    "text": "Arthur is five years old when he learns about his person.\nThe five kingdoms have just seen the worst harvest they've had in decades. Come winter, Camelot is full of hungry citizens coming to ask their king for help, but there's hardly anything in the grain stores to give them. The neighbouring realms aren't doing any better. What Arthur remembers most about it are the things Father tells him to forget - the thin faces of the children staring up at the castle as they're turned away, and the ache in his full stomach every night.\nWhen he first complains of the pain, Father looks concerned and has Gaius look him over immediately. \n\u201cThere's nothing wrong with him, sire,\u201d Gaius says, significantly, after examining Arthur. \nArthur\u2019s not sure why Gaius is emphasizing it that way, or why Gaius is saying there\u2019s nothing wrong when it hurts so much Arthur just wants to curl up and cry.\nFather\u2019s frown deepens into an expression of disapproval. Arthur\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s done wrong. Does his father think he\u2019s lying?\n\u201cI\u2019m not lying!\u201d he says. \u201cIt does hurt!\u201d\n\u201cYes, Arthur, we believe you,\u201d Gaius says. \u201cI meant that it isn\u2019t from a physical affliction - at least, not on you.\u201d\nArthur frowns. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\nGaius opens his mouth, but Father speaks first.\n\u201cEveryone is assigned to suffer the pain of another person, as well as their own,\u201d Father explains. \u201cCommoners think this connection has some meaning - they often marry the person they share pain with. You will marry for the good of Camelot - which means you will not marry whatever peasant is going hungry right now and causing you pain. Is that clear?\u201d\nArthur nods, largely unbothered. Why would he want to marry whoever\u2019s hurting him?\n\u201cGood,\u201d Father says. \u201cIt will serve you best to ignore the pain when it occurs. Do what you can for him,\u201d he orders Gaius, and leaves.\n*\nThe pain continues through the entire winter. As unpleasant as it is, Arthur almost panics when he stops feeling it. Did they die?\nThen he realizes it is spring, and there is more food to be had. They\u2019ve simply stopped going hungry. He smiles, rubs his belly, and moves on with his life.\n*\nArthur breaks his right arm in training when he\u2019s eight. Gaius pronounces it a clean break that will heal completely, and Father smiles and says it\u2019ll be an opportunity for Arthur to practice his weapons with his left arm.\nOnce Father has left and Gaius is mixing something up for the pain, Arthur asks, \u201cCan my person feel this, too?\u201d\nHe hasn\u2019t felt much pain from his person, not since the famine. Arthur\u2019s always bruised and aching from training, so a little extra pain would be barely noticeable, anyways. When it happens, he\u2019s mildly curious about what they\u2019re doing, but he doesn\u2019t spend much time thinking about it.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Gaius says. \u201cSometimes little aches don\u2019t transfer, but I imagine that arm hurts more than enough to pass it on, hm?\u201d\nArthur says bravely, \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad.\u201d\nGaius pours the mixture he\u2019s just made into a small cup for Arthur. \u201cWell, let\u2019s help you both out.\u201d\nIt tastes disgusting. Arthur drinks the whole thing anyways; he doesn\u2019t want his person to suffer on his behalf.\n*\nYears go by without Arthur feeling anything significant from his person - at least, anything he could distinguish from his own bruises. He stops worrying so much about inflicting his hurts on them - he\u2019s the prince, after all. He doesn\u2019t need to care about some peasant.\n*\nAnd then Arthur beats a peasant with a broomstick and it hurts. Each expertly-placed blow sends a shock of pain through Arthur in the exact same spot on his own body.\n\nHe\u2019s found his person.\n\nArthur\u2019s intrigued by him - Merlin. He\u2019s brave and disrespectful and foolish. Knowing this, Arthur can\u2019t help but concoct stories for the pain he remembers getting over the years - probably being hit while trying (uselessly) to defend someone smaller than himself, or else for disrespecting the wrong person. He wants to ask Merlin if he\u2019s right, but Father\u2019s words all those years ago stop him. He\u2019s supposed to forget Merlin.\nHe decides he won\u2019t ever speak to the peasant again.\nAnd then Father makes Merlin his manservant.\n*\nArthur\u2019s not foolish enough to tell his father that he\u2019s found the person he shares pain with. And Gaius is loyal to Father. He goes to someone else.\n\u201cMorgana, what do you think Father would say if I knew who I share pain with?\u201d\n\u201cIf you found your soulmate?\u201d Morgana clarifies.\n\u201cMy what?\u201d Arthur says. He scoffs. \u201cOh, is that the peasants\u2019 term for it?\u201d\nMorgana snorts. \u201cThat\u2019s everyone\u2019s term for it, Arthur. And I don\u2019t imagine Uther would be pleased. If anyone else found out who your soulmate is, they could capture them and torture you through them. They could control you that way.\u201d\nArthur winces. He should\u2019ve realized that for himself, he supposes. It just didn't occur to him because for so long he's been thinking of his person as someone distant and not entirely real.\nMorgana isn\u2019t finished. \u201cI imagine Uther wouldn\u2019t take that risk,\u201d she continues. \u201cHe\u2019d probably have them killed, even though it\u2019s supposed to be unbelievably painful to have your soulmate die violently.\u201d\nArthur can\u2019t help the shudder that passes through him. Merlin, dead? His hand unconsciously goes to his shoulder, where he still bears an ache that isn\u2019t his, and he thinks of Merlin\u2019s grin and his dancing eyes. All of that being gone forever is\u2026 unthinkable.\nMorgana nods like she knows what he\u2019s thinking, and puts her hand on his arm. \u201cIf you do know, or even suspect,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\n*\nArthur takes Morgana\u2019s advice to heart. He also goes a step further with it: he does his best to make sure Merlin\u2019s not witness to any of his injuries. He piles on tasks that mean Merlin will be far away from Arthur while he\u2019s training. When he is injured, he deals with his injuries himself. \nHe knows that keeping Merlin in the dark can\u2019t last for long, but it buys him a little time. It\u2019s helpful that Merlin can be a bit of a wimp.\nFor example: \u201cSire, could I have the afternoon off?\u201d Merlin says, after Arthur takes a particularly nasty blow in training. \u201cMy soulmate\u2019s injured his knee, and I can barely walk.\u201d\nArthur\u2019s just limped up the stairs to his rooms himself, and knows Merlin\u2019s not exaggerating. Walking was almost unbearable, and it\u2019s now taking all of his strength to stand up straight so that Merlin doesn\u2019t realize they\u2019re experiencing the exact same pain.\n\u201cFine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you\u2019re to be on time tomorrow morning.\u201d\nMerlin makes a face like Arthur is being unreasonable, but he's not. Arthur knows his body, and while he\u2019ll be sore tomorrow, he - and therefore Merlin - should be fine to walk.\n\u201cYes, sire,\u201d Merlin says, once he's done making faces. He limps to the door, then pauses. \u201cYou know, you should really reconsider this warrior thing, sire. It\u2019s very mean to your soulmate.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe your soulmate should just learn to fight better,\u201d Arthur says, insulting Merlin automatically before he realizes he\u2019s actually insulting himself.\nMerlin huffs and limps away.\nArthur collapses into a chair the instant the door closes behind Merlin, gratefully taking his weight off the bad leg. \n*\n(Not very much later, Arthur can\u2019t believe Merlin complained about him causing them pain. Who does he think he is, drinking poison? And then expecting Arthur to save his life while in almost unbearable agony? What an idiot.)\n*\nArthur, actually, manages to keep it hidden for a surprisingly long time. In that time, Arthur develops a fierce loyalty towards Merlin, a strong friendship with him, and more than a little attraction to him. Waking to Merlin's smile is wonderful. Making him smile is the highlight of Arthur's day. Making fun of him on hunts and being mocked back is novel and hilarious. Coming back to his rooms after a long day wouldn't feel right anymore without Merlin's constant prattling in the background. \nOh, Arthur thinks, so this is falling in love.\n*\nEventually, though, Arthur bumps into Merlin just after getting a sword cut to the arm during training. Merlin\u2019s supposed to be in the stables, so Arthur goes to Gaius\u2019 to have the arm bandaged. He finds his servant lazing about outside the physician\u2019s chambers.\nWell, probably he had been lazing. Now Merlin\u2019s holding his own arm and swearing. When Arthur comes in, his eyes zero in on the blood stain on Arthur\u2019s arm, presumably exactly matching the line of pain along Merlin\u2019s arm.\nHe stares at Arthur. \u201cYou\u2019re-\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Arthur says.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Merlin says indignantly. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me to shut up! I\u2019m your -\u201d\n\u201cYou are nothing,\u201d Arthur hisses. \nMerlin steps back, a deeply wounded look crossing his face. It\u2019s not something Arthur\u2019s used to seeing on his usually cheerful manservant, and he doesn\u2019t like it. \nHe grabs Merlin\u2019s arm and yanks him into Gaius\u2019 rooms, away from prying eyes or listening ears. \u201cIf anyone finds out who I share pain with, they could control me by kidnapping and torturing y- him. Which means that if my father finds out, he\u2019d have my soulmate killed before that could happen. So you are absolutely nothing to me. Do you understand?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Merlin says, very softly. \u201cYes. I understand.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Arthur says. \u201cNow stop holding your arm, because there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. And get me some bandages.\u201d\n*\nArthur refuses to discuss the soulmate thing with Merlin for the next few days. He glares whenever Merlin appears to be trying to bring it up. If Merlin ignores the implicit threat and actually says something, Arthur immediately speaks loudly over him and orders him to do the most unpleasant chore he can think of at the moment.\n\u201cSeriously, Arthur, about -\u201d\n\u201cGo draw me a bath,\u201d Arthur orders, because Merlin\u2019s already mucked out the stables twice and polished every single piece of Arthur\u2019s armour. Arthur doesn\u2019t particularly want a bath, but he\u2019ll suffer through it.\nMerlin huffs at him and stalks away.\nAlthough, something\u2019s eating at Arthur about the whole thing.\n\u201cAbout the other day,\u201d Arthur starts, when Merlin comes back into his rooms.\nMerlin drops the buckets of water he\u2019d lugged up from the kitchens. One wobbles, but lands upright; the other splashes out all over Arthur\u2019s floor. Merlin doesn\u2019t seem particularly concerned.\n\u201cSo now we\u2019re talking about it?\u201d he demands.\nArthur sighs. \u201cFirst of all, you really shouldn\u2019t address me with that tone. Second, no, I\u2019m talking, and you\u2019re listening. Look, no matter how careful we are, chances are that someone's going to catch on eventually. And one way or another, that's not going to end well for you. You should leave.\u201d\n\u201cYou're an impressively bad soulmate,\u201d Merlin says. He parrots, \u201c\u2018You're nothing, Merlin. You should leave, Merlin.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cDon't say that word aloud,\u201d Arthur hisses. \u201cI'm not trying to be romantic, I'm trying to keep you alive and in one piece. I'll give you coin for a horse, and enough for food and lodging while you look for a new job, all right?\u201d\n\u201cI'm not going anywhere.\u201d Merlin crosses his arms. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my mouth shut, and I\u2019ll try to stop wincing at things, but I won't leave. I care about you. Even before I knew the - the thing we aren't talking about, I wouldn't have left! You matter. A lot.\u201d\nArthur huffs. \u201cEventually someone\u2019s going to figure this out. When that happens, one way or another, you\u2019ll be killed.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you won't!\u201d Arthur says. He\u2019s had nightmares ever since the first day he talked to Morgana about this, nightmares about being locked up by his father and fighting his way free only to find Merlin already dead - beheaded, or poisoned, or burned, or something worse. They\u2019ve only gotten worse in the past few days since Merlin found out.\n\u201cYou should leave,\u201d he insists. \u201cGo somewhere far away, where no one will be suspicious if I\u2019m injured in battle and you fall down screaming at the same time.\u201d\n\u201cAre you done?\u201d Merlin asks.\nHe looks angry. Arthur doesn\u2019t want that, even if it would probably be for the best.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying I want you to leave,\u201d Arthur says, softly. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019d hate to replace you now I\u2019ve finally gotten used to your uselessness. But you shouldn\u2019t give your life for me.\u201d\nMerlin smiles. \u201cArthur. It\u2019s far too late for you to tell me that.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re fired,\u201d Arthur says.\nIf Merlin were any other servant, that would be the end of it. Merlin would skulk away and get a job he was actually qualified for - mucking the stables, perhaps? - and he'd promptly be replaced by someone eager to suck up to Arthur.\nMerlin turns and checks that they\u2019re alone. Then he says, \u201cI love you too.\u201d\nArthur doesn\u2019t care that he\u2019ll share the bruise - he throws a shoe at him.\n*\nMerlin seems to think he\u2019s won their argument.\nBut despite the fact that Merlin has started saying \u201cI love you\u201d to Arthur, and has taken for granted that Arthur loves him too, Arthur is absolutely not going to court him. Not while, if it got out that Merlin is his soulmate, there\u2019d be a race between Uther\u2019s men and Camelot\u2019s enemies to see who could get their hands on Merlin first.\nHe won\u2019t touch Merlin even if no one\u2019s looking; he won\u2019t say anything even vaguely kind to Merlin in public; and \u201cIf you wink at me like that ever again, Merlin, I\u2019ll drag you to the dungeons myself.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Merlin complains, flopping onto Arthur\u2019s bed - where Arthur has repeatedly made clear Merlin is not allowed. The sight of him spread out there is too tempting for Arthur to deal with.\nArthur swallows. It has occurred to him that Merlin might have realized why he made that rule, and that\u2019s why he flouts it with such regularity.\n\u201cI get it; nobody can know we\u2019re soulmates,\u201d Merlin says, too loud for Arthur\u2019s liking. He ignores Arthur\u2019s hushing. \u201cBut people who aren\u2019t soulmates have relationships all the time, Arthur! And they have sex even more.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but if people knew I was courting you, it would make them far more suspicious if we seemed to be injured at the same time,\u201d Arthur says.\nWhy is it so hard for Merlin to try to stay alive?\n\u201cAll right, but even if I agreed with that - and I\u2019m not saying I do - how is anyone going to know what goes on in your room, with the door locked?\u201d Merlin winks at Arthur in exactly the way Arthur had just told him not to. \u201cWhat exactly is stopping you from getting in this bed with me?\u201d\n\u201cPeople talk!\u201d Arthur says. \u201cThe servants, the nobles - everyone gossips. And they\u2019re experts at figuring out secrets by now. No matter how careful we were, they\u2019d find out.\u201d\nMerlin huffs.\n\u201cAnd then Father would kill you,\u201d Arthur reminds him.\nMerlin grumpily rolls off Arthur\u2019s bed, which Arthur takes as a graceless capitulation, until Merlin walks right up to him. \n\u201cOne kiss,\u201d Merlin says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll stop asking.\u201d\nThis is suspicious. The stubborn tilt of Merlin\u2019s chin says this isn\u2019t a capitulation, but a tactic: he's trying to show Arthur what he\u2019s missing by insisting they be cautious. But Arthur does need him to stop asking - because it\u2019s very hard to say no, and Arthur doesn\u2019t have endless reserves of willpower.\nArthur puts a hand on Merlin\u2019s waist and leans in. He puts all of his longing into the kiss, all the love that he cannot, cannot express until he\u2019s king. Merlin\u2019s safety is paramount, absolutely, but he also wants Merlin to never doubt how loved he is. Merlin gasps against his mouth as Arthur cups the back of his neck and pulls him closer, and Arthur hopes he\u2019s managed to communicate at least some of that.\nArthur pulls back, and Merlin just stares after him for a long moment. Unconsciously, it seems, his hand goes to his lips. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, softly, as if Arthur\u2019s just changed his entire world with the one kiss. \nWell, good.\n\u201cSee?\u201d Arthur says. \u201cIf you were this starstruck all the time, people would notice.\u201d\nMerlin\u2019s adorably smitten expression disappears, and he punches Arthur\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI want to speak to whoever\u2019s in charge of this soulmate thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI have several complaints to make.\u201d\nWhether because of Arthur's hilarious joke or their deal, Merlin doesn\u2019t try anything with Arthur for an entire week, so overall it was a success.\nExcept for the way Arthur now can\u2019t stop thinking about Merlin\u2019s lips.\n*\nTime goes on; six very uneventful months pass. (That is, they\u2019re uneventful with regards to the soulmate thing, not in general; Arthur's nearly murdered like ten times.) Arthur is just considering that maybe dating Merlin in secret wouldn't actually be a death sentence for him when Morgana, passing by him in a corridor, happens to tease him, \u201cI heard a rumour Merlin spurned your advances.\u201d\nIt's a good thing they're the only ones in the corridor, because Arthur feels himself go white as a sheet as he snaps, \u201cWhat?\u201d\nMorgana laughs. \u201cI hadn't actually thought it was true!\u201d she crows gleefully. When Arthur keeps staring at her in horror, she pats his arm and adds, \u201cOh, Arthur, there are plenty of other fish in the sea.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201d Arthur demands, struggling to keep his voice calm.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal,\u201d Morgana says, but then she freezes and studies Arthur's face. \u201cUnless it is a big deal? Arthur, Merlin's not -\u201d She pauses, just for a moment, and then says with certainty, \u201cHe is.\u201d\nArthur deflates, puffing out a breath and sagging against the wall. \u201cYes.\u201d\nMorgana wraps her hand around Arthur's wrist and pulls him into an empty room off of the corridor. She shuts the door behind them.\n\u201cUther's going to kill him,\u201d she hisses.\n\u201cDon't you think I know that?\u201d Arthur whispers back. At least, he starts out whispering. \u201cIt's not like I asked Father to make him my servant! But he is, and he keeps trying to - to kiss me, and he wants to court me, like he has some sort of death wish!\u201d\n\u201cSo you turned him down,\u201d Morgana says.\n\u201cOf course I did!\u201d Arthur says. \u201cFather would kill him!\u201d\nMorgana nods, very seriously, and squeezes his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d\nArthur gives her a small smile. He knew that, of course, but it\u2019s good to hear, all the same. \u201cI just hope it\u2019s enough. Between my training, and how clumsy Merlin is, we both get hurt a lot - and it would just take one slip...\u201d\nMorgana\u2019s sympathetic look suddenly turns crafty. \u201cLet me help you with that,\u201d she says.\n\u201cHow?\u201d Arthur asks.\nShe just smirks at him and breezes out of the room.\nArthur does not feel particularly relieved.\n*\nA week later, the ladies of the court are casting sidelong glances at Arthur and tittering in the way that means they\u2019ve got particularly juicy gossip about him. Arthur would be worried, but Morgana\u2019s in the thick of it looking very satisfied, so -\nNo, wait, Arthur should still definitely be very worried. What the hell has Morgana told everyone?\nHe has far too much dignity to ask anyone what the gossip is about, so he finds out in a roundabout way from Leon.\n\u201cSire,\u201d Leon says, with a small bow, \u201cI want to assure you I did nothing intentionally to incite the rumours, and to offer my sincere apologies if I somehow caused them accidentally.\u201d\n\u201cThe rumours?\u201d Arthur says, trying to sound like he hasn\u2019t even noticed everyone pointing and whispering about him because he\u2019s so far above that sort of thing.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Leon says awkwardly, \u201csome people have been saying that we - that you and I -\u201d\nThe bright shade of red on Leon\u2019s face unmistakably explains what Leon is trying to say. Arthur can\u2019t believe Morgana picked Leon, of all people, to be his - his fake boyfriend. He\u2019s known Leon since he was a toddler; he\u2019s basically Arthur\u2019s brother.\nLeon is still trying to politely explain that people think they\u2019re having sex. Arthur takes pity on him and nods.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t do anything to, ah, bring this about,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ladies of the court can be fickle.\u201d\nBy which Arthur means, the Lady Morgana is evil.\nLeon looks relieved. \"I'm very glad to hear you say that, sire,\" he says, and Arthur nods at him graciously.\n*\nThe next time Arthur sees Morgana, he hisses, \"Leon? Really?\"\n\"Well, you could do worse!\" Morgana says. \"Besides, I didn't want to cause any domestics.\"\nArthur frowns. \"I have plenty of unmarried knights who aren't Leon.\"\n\"No, no,\" Morgana tuts, like Arthur's a child, \"I meant with you and Merlin. He might've believed it if it had been someone else.\"\nOkay, that's actually\u2026 a weirdly good point. Arthur looks at Morgana suspiciously. \"You're being oddly helpful.\"\n\"I like Merlin. He's good for you.\" She smirks. \"And the look on Leon's face was priceless.\"\n*\nMerlin tries to convince Arthur that Morgana's ruse means they can date in secret. Arthur insists it means the exact opposite: that someone has found them out, and any day, any moment, someone far worse could do the same. So they stay in their routine of only loving each other quietly and privately, in looks and soft smiles and tiny touches they only exchange fleetingly behind locked doors, and in ways that can be disguised into the actions of a loyal servant and a grateful prince, or of two brothers in arms.\nSomeday, Arthur thinks to himself, but he hardly dares to finish the sentence even within his own mind.\n*\nArthur always feels a little guilty when he gets hurt these days. He wakes up on a hard cold floor, the ache in his entire body eclipsed by his pounding head, and his first thought, through the fog in his head, is of concern for Merlin.\nHis second is, oh, shit, where am I? It\u2019s a dungeon, but not Camelot\u2019s dungeon, for sure - he\u2019s spent enough time dragging Merlin in and out of it that he\u2019d recognize those cells.\nArthur remembers leaving the castle to hike. He remembers going into the woods. He remembers\u2026 a noise behind him, and something hitting him very hard over the head.\nGreat. A kidnapping. Arthur knows his father will ransom him - he doesn\u2019t have a choice, after all; Arthur is his only heir - but Father won\u2019t be happy about it. Arthur will be lectured for weeks about his responsibilities to the kingdom and his inability to defend himself.\nDespite the pain in his head, Arthur struggles to his feet. Dizzy, he grabs the wall to steady himself, making a face when his hands touch something mushy - the walls of this dungeon cell have not been well-cleaned.\nUnfortunately, that state of neglect doesn\u2019t extend to the bars holding Arthur inside. He tries to rattle them loose, but only succeeds in rattling his brain very painfully around in his skull. He slumps back onto the ground: better to conserve his energy for when he has a chance at escaping.\nA tiny window high in the cell wall lets Arthur judge the passing time. After a few hours, footsteps approach. Arthur scrambles to his feet, eager to try his luck if the guards are foolish enough to open his cell door.\nTwo men approach: one the largest man Arthur\u2019s ever seen, in armour, and one an average-sized man in expensive clothes who looks tiny in the other\u2019s shadow. Arthur has never seen them before, but clearly the larger is a guard and the smaller perhaps the mastermind here - or at least, in charge between the two of them.\n\u201cCamelot does not respond lightly to the crimes you have committed,\u201d he tells the smaller man. \u201cBut if you let me go now, the king may still be reasonable.\u201d\nThe man laughs. \u201cOnce we\u2019re done with you, there\u2019ll be no king.\u201d\nArthur stiffens. \u201cNo matter what you do to me, I will never do anything to harm my father.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need you to do anything,\u201d the man says. He gestures the guard towards Arthur. \u201cRemember, no fatal damage. He\u2019s useless dead.\u201d\nThe guard nods and starts to unlock Arthur's cell. Arthur settles into a fighting stance, but with the injury to his head, it\u2019s a struggle to even stand upright. He only lands a glancing hit to the guard\u2019s huge jaw before he\u2019s falling over almost entirely of his own accord.\nThe guard holds him up by one shoulder, and swiftly punches him in the gut three times. When he lets go, Arthur drops, moaning and holding his stomach. The guard turns and walks out of the cell, then re-locks the door. Arthur\u2019s chance of escape is gone, and next time he\u2019ll be in even worse shape to manage it.\n\u201cBetter hope that your servant learns fast,\u201d the small man tells Arthur, with a weird sort of sneer about the servant, \u201cor we\u2019ll be back for a lot more.\u201d\nThey leave Arthur lying there useless, in so much pain it takes him a few minutes before he realizes what\u2019s going on.\nThat sneer was because the man knows, somehow, that Merlin isn\u2019t just Arthur\u2019s servant, but his soulmate. Hurting Arthur was a message for Merlin, who must be around here too, somewhere. They\u2019re trying to force Merlin to kill Father - although how they think Merlin would do that, Arthur has no idea.\nArthur shifts position, as if anything will help the pain in his stomach and his head. At least all the pain he can feel, he came by honestly - wherever Merlin is, he hasn't been physically harmed. It\u2019s not much comfort, though, when he knows the terrible dilemma that Merlin must be facing.\nArthur\u2019s breathing starts to get louder, and he forcibly quiets it. He hadn\u2019t fully noticed it before, but he\u2019s listening intently; waiting, with some anticipation. He realizes, slowly and with quite a lot of dread, that he is actually hoping for the men to return and torture him.\nIf they don\u2019t, it means that Merlin\u2019s going to try to kill his father. It means that soon, either Merlin or Father will be dead.\nArthur closes his eyes and wonders if the fact that no one\u2019s come yet means Merlin\u2019s already gone on a terrible fool\u2019s errand.\nThe fog in his head is getting worse, and it\u2019s almost welcoming to slide into.\n*\nThere is an awful lot of banging. It makes Arthur\u2019s headache much worse. He does not want to wake up.\nBut there is just so much banging. And then a lot of yelling. And then Arthur revises his opinion: that was only a little bit of yelling. This is a lot of yelling.\nIt must be a rescue. There must be a small army, by the sound of it.\nArthur struggles to sit up. If he\u2019s being rescued, he wants to at least look mildly alert, not be caught napping in his cell. But his arms give out on him, and he slides back to the ground and hits his head again, and not even the screaming can keep him awake.\n*\n\u201cArthur. No, no, no. Arthur!\u201d\nArthur tries to tell Merlin to shut up and let him sleep.\nMerlin makes a sobbing noise. Baby. It wasn\u2019t that mean.\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Rise and shine, Arthur. Come on, open your eyes.\u201d\nHa. No.\n\u201cFor me?\u201d Merlin whispers. \u201cArthur, open your eyes, for me.\u201d\nThat\u2019s low. Arthur doesn\u2019t want to get up ever again, wants to fade back into the blissful oblivion of sleep, but he can\u2019t ignore Merlin asking like that. Slowly, hating every moment of it, Arthur opens his eyes.\nMemories come back slowly as he squints around. He\u2019s in a dungeon - oh, yes, the dungeon. And Merlin\u2019s here. Merlin wasn\u2019t here before - he was off dying. Now he\u2019s kneeling next to Arthur, cradling Arthur\u2019s head in his lap, and he\u2019s especially gorgeous because he\u2019s alive and Arthur wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d get to see him again. Arthur grabs at his arm, and Merlin smiles tearfully down at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d he says.\nMerlin\u2019s covered in an awful lot of blood. Soaked in it, really, There are streaks of it across his face.\nMerlin follows his gaze. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, as if noticing this for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m fine too.\u201d\nIt\u2019s all coming back to Arthur - the threats to himself, to Merlin, to his father.\nHe\u2019s terrified to ask, but he has to know. \u201cFather?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Merlin says. \u201cI would never hurt your father, Arthur.\u201d\nArthur snorts softly. Of course he wouldn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t.\nMerlin gives him a very strange, strained smile.\n\u201cDo you think you can get up?\u201d Merlin asks gently, helping Arthur to sit. \u201cWe should really get out of here.\u201d\nArthur\u2019s about to summon up to the will to make a joke about that - how are they supposed to get past the bars and the guards, huh, Merlin? - when he sees that the door of his cell is not just open, but blasted away. The enormous guard who beat Arthur is lying on the ground outside; the angle of his neck suggests he won\u2019t get up again.\nArthur recalls the noise from earlier. He looks at Merlin. \u201cDid you bring an army?\u201d\nMerlin twists his hands and bites his lip and, slowly, shakes his head.\nArthur\u2019s bewildered. \u201cWell, what happened, then? Did you annoy them into killing themselves?\u201d\nActually, this is Merlin. That seems plausible.\nBut Merlin shakes his head. \u201cThey hurt you,\u201d he says, softly.\nArthur already knows that.\n\u201cI just had to get to you,\u201d Merlin says, still weirdly soft. \u201cArthur - I\u2019d never, ever hurt you, or any of our friends. Or anyone, really, unless I had to.\u201d\nArthur wants to make a joke about how of course Merlin wouldn\u2019t, because he\u2019s too small to do anyone any damage. But there\u2019s a dead guard outside Arthur\u2019s open cell door, and no sign of any of Arthur\u2019s other captors. And Merlin\u2019s tone is odd and he\u2019s bowing strangely into himself, trying to look unintimidating - like he needs to try, despite being covered in blood that isn\u2019t his. Merlin clearly did cause a lot of damage. Somehow.\n\u201cHow?\u201d Arthur asks.\n\u201cMagic,\u201d Merlin whispers. \u201cArthur, I have magic. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d\nArthur would shake his head, if he thought it wouldn\u2019t be horrifically painful. \u201cNo.\u201d\nMerlin is not a sorcerer. He\u2019s - he\u2019s Merlin. Clumsy and adorable and utterly harmless.\nIf he were evil, Arthur would know.\nMerlin laughs, a little, not very happily. \u201cAll right,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to believe me right now. We need to get you back to Camelot so Gaius can take a look at you. Do you think you can get up?\u201d\nMerlin is still covered with blood that doesn\u2019t seem to be his own, and Arthur would like to insist on knowing how, exactly, he managed it - but Merlin\u2019s right, they should get out of here. Besides, whatever it is, it\u2019s still Merlin. He can trust him.\nArthur takes Merlin\u2019s offered hands, and manages to work his way to his feet. Merlin must be supporting the majority of his weight, because Arthur doesn\u2019t feel very heavy.\nThere was a weird flash about Merlin\u2019s eyes, too, but Arthur\u2019s not thinking about that.\nOne painful step at a time - both of them wincing - they make their way out of the dungeon, through a run-down old castle, and into a courtyard. No one else is there - at least, no one alive. \nAlong the way, they pass at least a dozen more broken corpses that Arthur takes in with shock. The positions of the bodies - well, this wasn\u2019t a normal fight, that\u2019s for sure. Just inside the castle\u2019s entrance is the truest proof of that: another six men, thrown on their backs or against the wall in a semicircle, all apparently dead on impact. As if some massive force had exploded from the point - or the person? - they were all converging on.\nArthur looks sideways at Merlin. He did this? All of this destruction, this absolute devastation? This isn\u2019t normal magic. Arthur has fought sorcerers before; they\u2019re dangerous, but not this powerful. If Merlin did this - and Arthur\u2019s starting to believe he did - then Merlin has greater powers than anything Arthur\u2019s ever heard of.\nMerlin doesn\u2019t seem to notice Arthur watching him. He leads Arthur over to a tree and props him up against that, then stretches out his back. \u201cGive me a minute,\" he says, and then mutters something else that Arthur doesn't quite catch.\nHis eyes maybe flash again.\n\u201cHow far are we from Camelot?\u201d Arthur asks.\n\u201cAbout a day\u2019s ride,\u201d Merlin says.\nArthur looks around. \"We haven't got any horses.\"\n\"I said to give me a minute, didn't I?\" Merlin asks, and then a couple mares trot out of the woods towards them.\n\"Did you just make horses?\"\n\"No, I just summoned them.\"\n\"From where? Are you stealing some poor peasant's horse?\"\n\"Of course not! They belonged to the men who kidnapped you - they ran away during the fighting. Are you going to get on, or not?\"\n*\nAbout a quarter of the way back to Camelot, Arthur decides: Merlin isn't evil. He's clumsy and adorable and not entirely harmless and also very magical. Arthur can deal with that. \nHe's still Merlin.\n*\nAbout halfway back to Camelot, Arthur sits up straighter on his horse and says, \"Hang on.\"\n\"Yes?\" Merlin asks.\n\"You're a sorcerer.\"\n\"So you believe me now?\"\n\"No,\" Arthur says. \"I don't believe you at all. What were you thinking? Were you having fun not telling me? Merlin, if I'd known you could protect yourself, we could've been having so much sex.\"\n\"Oh my God,\" Merlin says faintly.\n\"Right?\" Arthur says. \"I thought if we got caught, Father would lock us both up and when he let me out, you'd be dead. But no, you could've just magicked yourself out! Poof! Are - why are you laughing?\"\nMerlin is probably laughing. Or maybe he's crying? Arthur's honestly not sure.\n\"Arthur, of all the reasons I expected you to be angry when you found out, this was nowhere on the list,\" Merlin says.\n\"Well, it should have been,\" Arthur says. \nArthur considers his head injury: it's no longer bleeding and Merlin's done his best to heal it, which Arthur happens to think is rather good. He still has a rather strong headache, but that's fine - he's always heard certain activities were rather good for getting rid of headaches, anyways.\n\"That looks like a comfortable patch of grass over there,\" he says, pointing.\n \"Arthur, you have a serious concussion!\"\nArthur nudges his horse towards the patch of grass. \n\"Oh my God,\" Merlin repeats, and follows him.\n*\nWhen they get back to Camelot, Gaius insists on Arthur sitting around in bed for a week, and then not doing anything that could risk him getting hit in the head again for a very long time. This means Arthur isn\u2019t permitted to escape when Morgana comes to make fun of him.\n\u201cYou and Merlin looked awfully close when he brought you back,\u201d Morgana teases. \u201cAny developments?\u201d\nArthur is going to deny everything, but then he thinks about it. Morgana has always kept his secrets, even when it means lying for him. And she\u2019s never liked Father\u2019s policies on magic. She absolutely refuses to attend the executions, and she\u2019ll argue with Father for days on end on behalf of accused sorcerers. There\u2019s no way she\u2019d turn Merlin in.\nBesides, he wants to tell someone.\n\u201cI\u2019m courting him now,\u201d Arthur says.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Morgana says. \u201cYou\u2019ll get him killed.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s the thing,\u201d Arthur says. He leans forward. \u201cI won\u2019t, because he can defend himself, because he\u2019s a sorcerer, Morgana.\u201d\n\u201cWhat.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Arthur says, revelling in getting to surprise someone else with this. \u201cAll this time, he\u2019s just been - \u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a sorcerer?\u201d Morgana interrupts, looking - oddly, indignant. She stands up.\n\u201cYes! Wait, where are you going?\u201d\n\u201cTo punch Merlin, and then borrow his spell books.\u201d She pauses at his door, and looks back at Arthur with some defiance. \u201cBecause I think I\u2019m a witch.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Arthur says. \u201cAll right, then.\u201d\nMorgana graces him with a genuine smile. \u201cI knew Merlin was good for you.\u201d"
