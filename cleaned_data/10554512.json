    "text": "\u201cJust  fucking  choose.\u201d Iwaizumi was trying to control his voice but it was getting harder every passing moment.  Especially when his best friend was being extremely difficult. \nOikawa, in real Oikawa fashion, just rolled his eyes slowly before releasing a raspy breath, \u201cMean, Iwa-chan. This was your idea! You should be patient with me!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m actually regretting it now.\u201d Iwaizumi huffed already thinking about scrapping the entire idea he saw in TV last night which he thought was pretty brilliant, completely forgetting that Oikawa could really be a diva.\n\u201cHmn\u2026 how about cuddling with hundreds of kittens?\u201d Oikawa mused pursing his dry lips. Iwaizumi glared at him, \u201cCats? Did Kuroo rub off on you that much?\u201d Too late to see that lopsided grin on Oikawa\u2019s face to know that he was just kidding.\nIwaizumi grunted, \u201cI\u2019m seriously going to choke you.\u201d Oikawa, however, just gave a raspy laugh before he picked up his fork to continue eating his fruits. Iwaizumi wanted an answer, but didn\u2019t want to stop Oikawa from eating especially when this was the first time he had seen him this lively\u2026 probably at the prospect of having his wish granted.\n\u201cHow about a whole day of alien movies and pizza and popcorn?\u201d He hums, taking a spoonful of plain yogurt from the plastic container beside his half-empty plate. He always heard about looking at a glass half-full instead of half-empty, but right now, half-empty seemed better because it meant Oikawa was distracted enough to eat something.\nHe snorted, \u201cThat is a lousy wish.\u201d\nOikawa pouted, \u201cHey! It\u2019s not! Spending a day watching alien movies would be amazing\u2026\u201d\n\u201c Tooru. \u201d Iwaizumi\u2019s voice was low and calm but it made Oikawa raise his eyes to look up at him. There were few occasions that Iwaizumi called him by his name, and when he does, it always made Oikawa\u2019s flutter a bit.\n\u201cBe serious.\u201d Iwaizumi continued, \u201cYou  wouldn\u2019t spend your wish to get that. Ask anything else. Not something we could do anytime, anyday.\u201d\nOikawa blinked at him\u2026 but Iwaizumi watched as those brown eyes became somber and lost their enthusiastic spark. He watched those eyes look down at the tray of food on his lap, wheeled by the nurse that morning. He watched as the feeble hands holding the plastic utensil shake a little, before he regained control once again of himself and gave the saddest, most beautiful smile Iwaizumi had ever seen. Then he, in a small very innocent voice said, \u201cI want to play volleyball with our old teammates\u2026 in our highschool court.\u201d\n There it was  . Iwaizumi somehow knew that was what he really wanted. He didn\u2019t know if he wanted Oikawa to tell him because he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to give it to him\u2026 even if he wanted to. Even if he called up their old teammates who already have lives of their own, but would surely drop everything and go back to Miyagi just to do this single thing for their old captain. They would do it, no doubt about it. And even if in the off chance that they wouldn\u2019t,  he  would still do it.\n But the doctors wouldn\u2019t allow it.  Not when Oikawa\u2019s condition for the past few weeks was getting worse. Not when no amount of medicine could counter the cancer cells spreading on his lungs that every waking moment felt too quick like Oikawa\u2019s short breaths\u2026 lost easily.\nIt was how it is now, anyway\u2026 and Iwaizumi as his best friend had lived through it with him\u2026 through the good days and bad days. This was one of the good days and Iwaizumi was thankful that he and Oikawa was having an almost normal, albeit annoying conversation with the latter actually eating.\nHe would take this anytime from those days when Oikawa was always in too much constant pain, when he described breathing as drowning in air\u2026 every gulp always coming short, every single oxygen felt like he was being stabbed in the chest repeatedly and Oikawa would hold it in. Whiny little baby that he is, Oikawa would refuse to rate the pain as a  10 , because he was sure something more painful would come and he was just preparing for that.\nThose days when Iwaizumi was torn between running out of the hospital room, go back home, curl up in bed and forget the look of despair in Oikawa\u2019s face. But he would always, stupidly choose the other option which was to stay by Oikawa\u2019s side. Stand quietly by the bedside table, just within reach\u2026 but would never reach out. Oikawa would always look up at him and every time he did, Iwaizumi always dreaded that that was the last time those brown eyes were ever going to look at him.\n\u201cI\u2019d take you.\u201d He said, not a single doubt in his voice, \u201cOnce you get out of the hospital. I\u2019ll call Mattsun and Makki. Heck, I\u2019ll even call our kouhais. It\u2019ll be a mini reunion.\u201d\nOikawa looked up at him with bleary eyes, disbelieving, before his face blossomed into an ear-splitting grin, \u201cWe can have a practice match.\u201d\nIwaizumi didn\u2019t realize that he was smiling, too\u2026 but only because it had been a very long time since he saw Oikawa\u2019s smile.\nThey stay quietly like that until a nurse came in to deliver some medicine and take away the tray of food. She has a soft voice and gentle face\u2026 and if Iwaizumi was being honest, looked kind of cute. She was a bit shy but her movements were graceful, and she gave a polite smile at Iwaizumi before she left.\nOikawa was looking curiously at him when his eyes just as much as trailed off on the nurse\u2019s direction. He frowned when he saw the glint on the setter\u2019s eyes, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re checking out my nurse.\u201d Oikawa chuckled, shaking his head, \u201cYou\u2019re too obvious, Iwa-chan.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying Shittykawa?\u201d He hissed, annoyed at the face the other guy was making.\nOikawa rolled his eyes, \u201cCome on. Aiko-chan is pretty. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised you find him really cute.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck?! Shut up or I\u2019ll punch you.I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re sick.\u201d Iwaizumi snapped again, looking away and seeing his reflection in the window. And  goddammit but he was blushing.\nOikawa pouted, \u201cMean Iwa-chan!\u201d But he was laughing, definitely enjoying this, \u201cYou should ask her out.\u201d\n\u201cI swear to god, Oikawa\u2026 if you don\u2019t--\u201d\n\u201cYou waste half of your days in the hospital, anyways. What\u2019s wrong with finding a little, cute lovelife while you\u2019re at it?\u201d The suggestion was pretty innocent and really positive, and yet Oikawa looked like he just signed a death sentence.\nIwaizumi moved to sit on Oikawa\u2019s bed but he was careful not to touch him, \u201cIs that what you really want?\u201d\nOikawa shrugged but didn\u2019t say anything\u2026 still refusing to look at him.\n\u201c Tooru.\u201d  He said and Oikawa\u2019s head quipped up, his brown eyes meeting Iwaizumi\u2019s hazel eyes. Iwaizumi thought how green and brown always looked good together\u2026  like branch and leaves, soil and grass\u2026 it was always natural to find green whenever you see brown.\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Oikawa said softly and for some unknown reason, Iwaizumi\u2019s heart sank. He, of course didn\u2019t know why because neither of them had ever put any other label in what\u2019s between them\u2026 save for being  best friends . But they also knew it was more than that.\nThey knew it ever since high school. Knew that best friends don\u2019t stick to each other that much, best friends don\u2019t miss each other too much and call each other everyday during college. Best friends don\u2019t walk you home, don\u2019t walk you to your station\u2026 or ride the bus at three in the morning, in the middle of a thunderstorm, with high fever to just see you\u2026 because he misses you. Best friends don\u2019t hold hands and they definitely\u2026 almost certainly never kiss while in a drunken stupor.\nIwaizumi sighed, looking up at the ceiling when his eyes passed by the clock on the wall and he realized he had to go to work. He groaned softly, \u201cI have to go to work.\u201d\nOikawa turned to him, that same look of despair in his eyes telling Iwaizumi don\u2019t go because I need you here, but of course, he would not say it and would cover it up with a smile and a \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Take care.\u201d \u00a0Except today, he just said, \u201cOkay.\u201d\nIwaizumi hated it. He was distancing himself again even when he knows he couldn\u2019t run away from Iwaizumi. So he did what any sane person would do at that moment--he grabbed Oikawa\u2019s face and forced him to look at him, \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, okay?\u201d\nOikawa looked at him painfully for a moment before he smiled and nodded, \u201cAlright. Goodbye, Iwa-chan.\u201d\n... But  the next morning, Oikawa\u2019s doctor and nurses advised Iwaizumi not to visit that day. \u201c  It\u2019s a bad day.\u201d  They said, \u201c  Only family is allowed.\u201d He had finally rated a level 10 pain last night because of an infection and he was depressed because his hair started falling out because of the new medicine they gave him. Iwaizumi knew how much his insufferable best friend loved his hair.\nStill, he had to see him. So he stood by Oikawa\u2019s door, watching the guy lying down on his bed, ventilator in place, staring up blankly at the ceiling. He was careful not to be seen\u2026 but at the same time, desperate too. He wanted Oikawa to know he was there\u2026 that he wouldn\u2019t just go because it was one of the  bad days . So when his nurse, Aiko came up to him to ask why he was still around, he asked for a piece of paper, scribbled something on it and asked her to pass it to Oikawa if she can.\nAiko, was happy to oblige, slipping the note in her pocket before she entered Oikawa\u2019s room. Iwaizumi left.\n\n You still owe me a wish, Shittykawa.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nFor the next three days, Iwaizumi stood by the door, watching Oikawa. For the next three days, he\u2019ll desperately wish Oikawa would just as much as turn to him\u2026 but all the machines connected in his body wasn\u2019t allowing him to.\nBesides, with all the drugs being pumped in his body, he had to be so weak to even lift a finger.\nOn the fourth day, at the lobby of the hospital, Iwaizumi saw Aiko who once again gave him a polite smile. He nodded at her, saying a quiet  \u2018Good morning.\u2019 And was about to leave when she called him up.\n\u201cAno\u2026 Iwaizumi-san.\u201d\nHe stopped in his tracks and looked back. This was the first time Aiko had called him. He didn\u2019t even know she knew his name. She came up to him, face red and so shy, \u201cUmm\u2026 can we talk for a bit?\u201d\nIwaizumi merely stared at him for a few moments before he snapped back in reality and nodded, \u201cUh, sure.\u201d\nThey went to the hospital garden which didn\u2019t have so many people. Just a few patients out on their morning stroll. Iwaizumi used to take Oikawa out here when he\u2019s feeling better but that was a few months ago.\nAiko chose a small, slightly isolated bench far away from where they entered. She sat nervously on the bench as Iwaizumi stood a few feet away from her, hands in his pocket.\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry about this.\u201d Aiko started looking down at her fingers, \u201cI just\u2026 I just want you to know\u2026 how I...well, really, how all of other nurses think your\u2026 love for Oikawa-san is admirable and brave.\u201d\n Okay, he didn\u2019t expect that . He blinked at Aiko who was looking at him now, a small smile on her lips. \u201cLove?\u201d He asked and she frowned a bit.\n\u201cYes. You  are  in love with him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She asked, \u201cI mean\u2026 you never missed a day without seeing him. Even if you couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d He paused and shook his head.  Love? Was he in love with Oikawa? That bratty little kid? That insufferable, annoying guy? He didn\u2019t know what to say\u2026 he just stared at Aiko, as these realizations hit him and he felt like he was drowning.\nSomehow, the expression he was making worried Aiko, \u201cWait, so you and Oikawa-san are not\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re\u2026\u201d he hesitated but said \u201cI\u2019m...\u201d\nAiko\u2019s eyes widened when she realized her mistake, \u201cI am sorry. I just thought that when Oikawa-san told me before he loves you so much that you two would be\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d\n\u201cEh?\u201d\n\u201cWhat did Oikawa tell you?\u201d\nShe frowned, not really understanding, \u201c...that he loves you? Surely, you knew.\u201d\nHe felt his face heat up\u2026 and he looked away, embarrassed. He stared up at the hospital building right in front of them as Aiko rambled on. He was searching for a particular window\u2026 one where he and Oikawa would spend countless of hours looking out at people in the garden. Oikawa would blanche at the romance of it all, watching sick people talk with their loved ones. Iwaizumi mostly considered it plain creepy.\nThat was when Oikawa was strong enough to get up from bed. When he wasn\u2019t confined in the hospital bed with dozens of machines whirring him awake all the time.\nIwaizumi didn\u2019t know when Aiko stopped talking, but she eventually did. And when she nudged his arm, he bit back a surprised remark. \u201cIwaizumi-san? Are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026 yeah.\u201d\nAiko smiled, \u201cGood. I\u2019m sure Oikawa-san would be happy to see you today.\u201d\n\u201cI can see him today?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. We just took him out of the ventilator last night. He\u2019s still weak\u2026 but he\u2019s awake.\u201d\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nOikawa looked frail and weak\u2026 but beautiful. He always had been. In strength and in weakness, Iwaizumi acknowledged that he had always made it beautiful, even when he never told him so.\nHe stopped by the door, unsure if he should walk in because Oikawa was sitting on his bed, back slumped, hands listlessly placed in front of him, head turned towards the window. He was paler and thinner than the first time he remembered him sitting on his hospital bed.\nThey were in college, Oikawa went home for summer while Iwaizumi stayed in Tokyo for his summer internship when he received a call from Mattsun who also went home that summer. Oikawa collapsed and was taken to the hospital.\nHe took the next bus to Miyagi as soon as he heard\u2026 only to find Oikawa sitting on the bed, grinning at him and teasing that he  worries too much. \nHe slowly pushed the door open but Oikawa didn\u2019t budge--too lost in his thoughts to notice him enter. He didn\u2019t say anything and just stood there in silence, observing him.\nHe looked smaller now, he was sure that if they stood side by side, he would be taller than him. His brown hair was mussed up and his heart ached because Oikawa cared so much about his hair that even on bad days, he made sure his hair was perfect. His hands were dry and bony and pale\u2026 just like the rest of him is. But in between those fingers, a slightly crumpled note was held.\nHis heart just flip-flopped and his brain stopped functioning and the fear that he almost lost him suddenly became too real.\nHe opened his mouth to call his name and get his attention. But what was supposed to be a  \u2018Oi Shittykawa\u2019  suddenly became\u2026 \u201cI love you.\u201d\nA sudden gasp. Then wide brown eyes turned to him again. \u201cIwa-chan?\u201d His name slipped out of those dry, cracked lips\u2026 and in two huge steps, Iwaizumi grabbed Oikawa\u2019s hand and pulled him close to his chest in a tight and awkward embrace.\nHe breathed in his scent\u2026 a mixture of disinfectant, a collection of drugs and the sweet smell of  just Oikawa  . He filled his lungs with this addictive scent and when he thought he couldn\u2019t get enough, he felt the other guy melt into him.\nHands circled his back, slowly and weakly\u2026 face burying at the crook of his neck. When he felt a wetness on his shoulder, he realized Oikawa was crying. In panic, he pulled away, holding him at arm's length, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Does it hurt anywhere?\u201d\nOikawa shook his head, hands covering half his face as tears and snot streamed down in disgusting yet adorable rivulets. \u201cI just\u2026\u201d he choked, \u201cI just thought you\u2019d never\u2026\u201d he took a couple of deep, painful breaths, \u201cI just love you so much.\u201d\nIwaizumi stared at him\u2026 just  stared  and saw all of  him  . With his annoyingly perfect bedhead, the adorably ugly cry face and those eyes glistening with tears that simply wouldn\u2019t stop. And god,  how did he miss it? \nOikawa Tooru was beautiful because  he would never, for the love of him, think he could be anything else but beautiful.\nThat night, when he kissed Oikawa, he wasn\u2019t nearly drunk enough as an excuse. He had no excuse except he always wondered what it would like to kiss Oikawa.\n\u201cIwa-chan\u2026 I\u2019m dying.\u201d Oikawa cried, \u201cIt\u2019s unfair\u2026 for you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is?\u201d\n\u201cThis. You doing this. It\u2019s\u2026 cruel.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you saying? We\u2019ve been basically together all our lives. Nothing\u2019s gonna change.\u201d\n\u201cEverything\u2019s going to change.\u201d Oikawa said adamantly, his voice hoarse and Iwaizumi wondered if speaking is also causing him too much pain.  Maybe. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to go and you wouldn\u2019t want me to go.\u201d\nIwaizumi gaped at him, he opened his mouth to say he was saying something really stupid, but he also knew it was true. Admitting their in love wouldn\u2019t change the fact that Oikawa was still gravely ill.  But\u2026  \u201cThen we\u2019ll just do it until it\u2019s time for you to  leave .\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like once you tell me we can\u2019t do this, we\u2019d be able to stop this anyway.\u201d\nHe was saying these things, but there was still a lingering fear at the back of his mind\u2026 but that fear of losing Oikawa was relatively miniscule compared to the fear of not having him at all.  The choice was pretty obvious .\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cI said I love you, goddammit.\u201d Iwaizumi hissed, getting more impatient. \u201cJust\u2026 allow me to love you, okay?,\nHe didn\u2019t know when Oikawa\u2019s tears stopped. Didn\u2019t know when his began--when Oikawa finally gave him the brightest smile he had seen for a long time. Or when Oikawa nodded. Or maybe when he pulled the chocolate-haired guy back into his arms and captured his lips.\nAll he knew was in that singular moment, everything felt nice like where they should be.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nTwo weeks later, Oikawa got his wish, thanks to Iwaizumi begging his doctors to allow it.\nIwaizumi held onto him tightly as the hospital van pulled over the familiar gate of their high school. The guy, sitting quietly beside him, was looking outside. He looked tired, but he always looked tired nowadays\u2026 still, his eyes were shining brightly so Iwaizumi knew he was happy.\nThe nurses helped him put Oikawa to a wheelchair while Aiko who was excited since yesterday assembled the portable oxygen tank they were carrying. He secured the cannula over Oikawa\u2019s ears before he proceeded to push him through the empty hallway of their high school to the place Oikawa wanted to see.\nTheir friends were already waiting for them at the entrance of the gym--Hanamaki and Matsukawa took a break from their wedding plans to drop by; the second years Yahaba and Watari took a leave in their respective corporate jobs in Tokyo while Kyoutani stepped out of his father\u2019s ramen restaurant for the day. Even the first years, Kindaichi and Kunimi skipped their classes just to drop by. And they were all wearing the same awkward, sad-happy smiles.\nA chorus of \u201cOikawa-san!\u201d and \u201cOikawa!\u201d was heard when they got nearer and the guy managed to give out a small smile, \u201cHey\u2026\u201d he said in a breathy whisper.\nAs planned, the rest of the nurses save for Aiko, excused themselves and went back to the van while their friends began animatedly talking about what they were up to all this time. Oikawa despite looking tired, listened eagerly at each one of them\u2026 looking at them straight in the eyes as they spoke as if he was memorizing their faces.\nAfter their little stories, Iwaizumi announced the next plan, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go change into our uniforms.\u201d Oikawa looked up at him, eyes filled with questions. Iwaizumi grinned at him, \u201cWhat? Did you think we just came here to chat? Of course, we\u2019ll be playing volleyball.\u201d He turned to Aiko who beamed up at him, \u201cCan you handle him for a moment?\u201d\nAiko nodded and Iwaizumi bent down and gave Oikawa a quick peck on the lips before he was off trailing behind the rest of their team who had already retreated back to where they left their bags.\nA few minutes passed, and suddenly the men who were just wearing a collection of casual shirts and jeans stepped into the court wearing their old uniforms which were a little too tight in some places, as Yahaba told Kyoutani who growled at him.\nBut overall, they looked like they did many years ago and the image burned so bad in Oikawa\u2019s eyes he was blinking back tears because he didn\u2019t want to cry in front of everyone. Not when they sacrificed a day in their busy schedule just to see him.\nIwaizumi walked past him as they divided into two teams. \u201cYou okay, Tooru?\u201d He asked and\u2026  did he really have to ask? He smiled, \u201cYou look hot in that uniform.\u201d Oikawa said making Aiko laugh. Iwaizumi blushed--the uniform was a little taunt especially on his arms. He had grown some muscles over the years and Oikawa had never been shy to compliment him with it. \u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d\n\u201cHey, loverboy! Team\u2019s already formed. Let\u2019s start.\u201d Matsukawa called out and Iwaizumi shrugged at Oikawa who smiled and shooed him off.\nIt was Iwaizumi-Matsukawa-Yahaba-Kunimi versus Hanamaki-Kyoutani-Kindaichi-Watari. The game was overall balances, except Kyoutani, in real Kyoutani fashion got riled up easily when Yahaba started teasing him. Hanamaki and Matsukawa couldn\u2019t stop giving each other sleazy remarks even when Iwaizumi told them to cut it off or he\u2019d kick them. Kindaichi and Kunimi just looked like they\u2019re lost in the whole drama. The only person taking the game seriously, surprisingly, was Watari who served as the setter.\nBy the end of the game, they were breathless and exhausted not just from the physical activity, but from the endless banters they had to endure.  At least, we won , was Iwaizumi\u2019s competitive mind was telling him. He looked over at Oikawa, to find tears falling freely from his eyes as he smiled and clapped when the final score was announced.\nThe entire court fell silent, with only the solitary pair of hands cheering them on. Nobody knew how to react\u2026 what to say. Iwaizumi watched Hanamaki bite his lower lip and closed his eyes shut to stop himself from crying. And when he did that, almost everyone started shedding tears\u2026 for the amazing captain who now watched on the sidelines.\nIwaizumi didn\u2019t cry. He walked towards Oikawa, knelt in front of him and wiped his tears away. \u201cI love you.\u201d Oikawa whispered, \u201cThank you for doing this.\u201d Iwaizumi smiled, eyes never leaving Oikawa\u2019s face, \u201cAs long as you\u2019re happy.\u201d\nThey stayed like that until the other members were calm enough to walk to him and gave him a resounding  \u201cArigatou, buchou!\u201d Bowing their heads so low. Aiko\u2019s phone rang and both Oikawa and Iwaizumi knew what that phonecall meant. They have to go.\nOikawa let his eyes wander around the familiar court--his home for the happiest years of his student life. This was where he met this team...  This family . \u201cThank you guys, for doing this for me.\u201d He said, forcing out the words out of his mouth even when they sound hoarse and raspy, \u201cYou have no idea how much I wanted to go back here\u2026 to see this place and play volleyball with you\u2026\u201d a deep breath, \u201cFor one last time.\u201d\nHanamaki was crying again, and this time he didn\u2019t try to hide it. \u201cI might not be able\u2026 to come back here after today.\u201d He smiled, \u201cBut I will always\u2026 always treasure every memories I\u2019ve had in the four corners of this court.\u201d\nNobody said a word, everyone just sort of stood there, afraid to break the moment. Iwaizumi stepped in, \u201cI guess, we have to go, guys. But really, thank you for doing this.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for them to respond as both he and Aiko began wheeling Oikawa out the court\u2026 only to stop when Kindaichi yelled out \u201cCaptain!\u201d\nIwaizumi stopped and turned Oikawa around to face them again. All of them were wearing a smile and suddenly they were high school students again\u2026 young, unafraid and wanted nothing else but to get into nationals.\n\u201cWe trust in you!\u201d\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know\u2026 I could give you guys some time before we go back to the hospital.\u201d Aiko said that as the three of them walked some more around the campus.\nOikawa smiled at her, \u201cYou would?\u201d\n\u201cWould that be safe?\u201d Iwaizumi asked. Aiko winked at them, \u201cAs long as it won\u2019t be too long. I\u2019m sure I could make some excuses.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t have to wait for Iwaizumi to respond, they parked the wheelchair and the portable oxygen by the bench across the football field where some gingko trees were growing in full bloom.\nIwaizumi sat beside Oikawa, \u201cDo you feel okay?\u201d\n\u201cI feel even better. Like\u2026 I\u2019m actually be cured tomorrow.\u201d Oikawa giggled as Iwaizumi rolled his eyes, \u201cCome on, I\u2019m serious.\u201d\n\u201cSo am I!\u201d Oikawa countered, turning towards the empty football field. The sun was almost setting and everything was washed by a golden orange light. It reminded him of those days when the two of them would walk together home.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cOur school.\u201d Oikawa said, \u201cI never regretted coming here\u2026 besides, we have like the prettiest uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cYou really have a shitty personality, don\u2019t you?\u201d Iwaizumi shook his head but he was laughing at the same time.\nOikawa joined in, although his laugh sounds different now because it was hard for him to do the usual one without running out of breath. Still, it sounded beautiful. When he stopped, he gave Iwaizumi a meaningful look, \u201cSo\u2026 about my last wish.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? I thought this was it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I never really thought you\u2019d be able to pull this off so I made a Wish B just in case.\u201d\n\u201cBut I did pull it off so there\u2019s no need for that, right?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not? I can have as many wishes as I can.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s called a last wish for a reason, dummy.\u201d Iwaizumi shook his head, \u201cBut yeah\u2026 fine. Tell me. You better make sure it doesn\u2019t involve kittens or any forms of animals.\u201d\nOikawa pouted \u201cWhy do you hate animals? They are so cute.\u201d\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like them, okay?\u201d Iwaizumi snapped, \u201cNow, are you telling me your wish or not?\u201d\nOikawa stuck his tongue out at him because even with his sickness and obvious weakness, there was just no limit to his childishness. \u201cI won\u2019t say it because I wrote it.\u201d\n\u201cFine, gimme it.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why not?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to find out.\u201d\n\u201cHow can I do it if you won\u2019t tell me?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll know when it\u2019s time.\u201d\nIwaizumi gaped at him, \u201cWhen it\u2019s time? What do you mean?!\u201d\nOikawa didn\u2019t answer him that afternoon, nor the next few days that he bugged him about it.  What was \u2018when it\u2019s time\u2019?  He didn\u2019t understand.  He soon did . After three months.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nOikawa Tooru died in his sleep at the age of twenty six, only two days short of his twenty seventh birthday. They didn\u2019t expect it because despite two weeks composed of  bad days , that one day, he was actually better.\nBut it didn\u2019t matter. Because Iwaizumi was there with him. He held Oikawa\u2019s hand as he slept, held him even when the doctors came and told him he was no more. He didn\u2019t cry. He didn\u2019t beg them to  try again. Because that night when Oikawa was supposed to be unconscious, he felt him squeeze his hand twice.\nIt was his own way of saying  I love you .\nHis funeral was simple, too. Everything was white and pure\u2026 just like how Oikawa wanted it to be. All of Oikawa\u2019s friends and family attended. There were a lot of tears and nostalgic stories which made them laugh, then cry harder at tbe end.\nIwaizumi didn\u2019t participate in any of those. He just stood beside the altar where Oikawa\u2019s photo and urn was. He was looking at Oikawa\u2019s photo\u2026 the high school, healthy version of him and not the way he looked before he died. He didn\u2019t know if Oikawa would like that.\nThere were no tears simply because they would not come. But  god,  he missed him so much. He wanted to go back to the hospital room and talk about how the rest of their volleyball team cried because of his funeral. He wanted to tell him how his funeral was beautiful, just like how he wanted it to be. He wanted to tell him\u2026  anything  . He just wanted to go back to the hospital room, lay down with him on the hospital bed and just\u2026  be with him .\nHe was in deep thoughts when someone approached him. He didn\u2019t look up, and just continued to stare at Oikawa\u2019s photo, trying to burn the image in his mind. \u201cIwaizumi-san.\u201d\nIt was Aiko, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d\nHe managed to give a very small smile and nodded before he turned back to the photo again, \u201cI\u2026 I just miss him.\u201d\nAiko sighed, \u201cHe\u2019s always been a fun person to be with. My hospital days would be lonely without him.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even get to give him his last wish.\u201d Iwaizumi\u2019s voice broke.\n\u201cAh, about that.\u201d Aiko said, \u201cOikawa-san gave this to me a few days before we went to Aoba Johsai. He told me explicitly to not read it and never give it to you until\u2026\u201d her voice faltered, \u201c...well, until you know.\u201d\nIwaizumi watched her pull a small white envelope from her bag and hand it to him. He took it and said his thanks before she excused herself and walked towards Oikawa\u2019s parents.\nIwaizumi stared at the white envelope on his hand, contemplating if he should open it or not\u2026  of course, he would. He ripped the sealed envelope and pulled out a familiar note from the inside.\n It was his note. The one he gave him before\u2026 only this time, Oikawa\u2019s handwriting was at the bottom as if to answer his question.\n\n Date her and love again. \n\n\u00a0\n\n+++\n\n\u00a0"
