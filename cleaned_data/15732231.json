    "text": "It had been only 30 minutes, but to Peter it seemed like time itself had stopped just to spite him. Tonight was Thursday, one of two Tower Nights during the week. Tower Nights were, as the name suggested, evenings where he\u2019d be picked up by Happy after school and taken to Stark Tower to work on various tech, including his own suit. He\u2019d stay over and be dropped off to Midtown in the morning. One of his fellow interns had texted him about her current project and maybe she\u2019d let him have a look at the -\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr Parker!\u201d startled Peter into awareness. \u201cThank you for your kind attention,\u201d smiled Mr Cobbwell. Peter smiled back sheepishly. \u201cClass, I have just received a notice,\u201d the teacher announced, waving the bunch of A4 sheets in his hand. \u201cOur field trip has been scheduled for next week, and I have permission slips for all of you here. Now, there are rules and regulations, as always, regarding conduct of students as representatives of the school; in addition to those, there are venue specific rules this time. Everything is outlined in these forms. They will have to be signed by a parent or guardian and returned to me by Monday.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere are we going, sir?\u201d asked Sally.\n\u00a0\nMr Cobbwell looked at the bored students and puffed himself up to make the announcement. Peter shivered slightly. \u201cIt seems we have been granted permission to go to Stark Tower!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe class didn\u2019t seem to share his excitement, although many of them sat up straighter and started whispering among themselves. Peter, on the other hand, sank lower in his seat. Ned looked at him\u00a0in shock and Peter helplessly shook his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that really unsafe, sir?\u201d ventured Luke. \u201cThat whole area\u2019s, like, a major target for all sorts of\u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up, Mendes,\u201d scoffed Flash. \u201cSince the Avengers went upstate it\u2019s been fine! What are these rules, Mr Cobbwell?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s mainly health and safety regulations, so you can\u2019t leave the tour group at any point, if you have a disability please mention it in the form, security badges are to be worn at all times \u2013 you need to submit a passport size photograph for your ID \u2013 phones are not allowed in certain areas, no hacking or stealing because that sets off alarms, and you can only update your social media once you\u2019re done with the tour, just in case,\u201d the teacher read out, to the groans of the class and the ring of the bell. \u201cIt's all written here, guys! Take a form on your way out, and remember \u2013 Monday latest!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey Parker, guess we\u2019re going to your workplace!\u201d called Flash, taking a form. \u201cCan you ask your boyfriend Spiderman to come by this time?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, he\u2019ll be there,\u201d muttered Peter. What was his life?!\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\nOver dinner the next night, May brought up the field trip. \u201cWhen I saw the email from your school, I couldn\u2019t control myself,\u201d she laughed. \u201cWhat is your life, even?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought too!\u201d Peter grinned. \u201cI mean, I was really quite worried at first because, you know, but then I realised, no one at the tower knows except Happy and Mr Stark! And not like they\u2019re gonna drop by! By the way, this is delicious, May\u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know, isn\u2019t it? I got the recipe from Geeta, it\u2019s not quite like she makes it but it\u2019s good, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTotally, it should go in the book,\u201d Peter assured her. \u201cWhat is it, a korma?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, I forgot to ask her\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\nThe next Thursday morning saw Peter rushing to make it to the school bus on time. He\u2019d had to double back because he forgot his ID, and then there was a dog walker with three (!!!) dogs and so of course he had to say hi to them all, and before he knew it he was running late.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHarrington told me about your reputation, Peter,\u201d grinned Mr Cobbwell, who seemed in high spirits. \u201cYou\u2019re the last one here!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry, sir, there was traffic!\u201d replied Peter, rushing into the bus and finding the seat Ned had saved for him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou walk to school,\u201d scoffed MJ from the seat across him.\n\u00a0\nPeter just grinned back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPsst,\u201d said a voice behind him. Thinking it was Ned, Peter turned back, but saw Ned had turned back too, and Flash was smirking at them. \u201cHey Penis, I\u2019m surprised you showed up! Thought you\u2019d be conducting the tour for us \u2013 you know, since you\u2019re an intern and all that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter\u2019s a\u00a0STEM intern, man,\u201d Ned snapped. \u201cStark Tower has proper guides to conduct tours.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Peter,\u201d Cindy called out. \u201cDo you know all the staff there?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, not really,\u201d Peter replied. \u201cI tend to go there in the evenings, so I don\u2019t really know the daytime staff. Plus I stick to my labs, you know?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA likely story,\u201d scoffed Flash, but was mainly ignored.\n\u00a0\nSome days Peter burned to ask Flash about his dad\u2019s car. He only wished he\u2019d had the suit then, if only for recording purposes. It might\u2019ve helped with the building, but you know. Mainly the video of Flash nearly pissing himself.\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\nAs they reached the tower, even the most nervous among the class were hyped up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, class, we cannot halt for more than two minutes, disembark quickly and do not leave any belongings behind!\u201d\n\u00a0\nOnce they went through the first security checkpoint and were inside the large lobby of Stark Tower, the students were welcomed by a young man named Jack. He pointed out the toilets and gave them ten minutes to take pictures around the lobby, while he took Mr Cobbwell to sort out the badges. Most students gravitated towards the Iron Man suit display to take pictures. Since they were early, they were one of the first tour groups of the day, and there was barely a line.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter idly looked around, waiting for Ned to return from the bathroom. MJ was staring at him again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he fidgeted self-consciously. Of all his acquaintances, MJ was the one he figured would deduce that he was Spiderman.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not staring at you. I\u2019m wondering if I should protest against capitalism and market domination by one single corporation.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you leaning towards?\u201d Peter asked, curious.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPepper Potts is the best thing to happen to this company, and maybe I should celebrate the shattering of the glass ceiling.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s amazing!\u201d Peter said enthusiastically. \u201cShe\u2019s honestly superhuman, she handles SI globally AND has time to talk to people AND manage press AND Mr Stark\u2013\u201d he could have gone on, but Jack was calling the students back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, I hope all of you have gone through the rules for the tour, those were NOT guidelines, and they have to be followed at all time. Mr Watson,\u201d he nodded to Alex, \u201cthe Tower is fully accessible by wheelchair, please be with me in the front so you can see without your classmates blocking your view. If you require any assistance please let me know.\u201d He handed Alex a badge and asked the class to come forward when their names were called out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNow, these are souvenirs, of course. You don\u2019t need to return them, but be warned that once you leave the Tower they will be disabled, so please don\u2019t wander off. If the card is used to access the Tower later, there will be consequences for you, so don\u2019t go selling them on eBay!\u201d he joked. \u201cAbernathy, Camille!\u201d\n\u00a0\nOnce he reached P, Jack looked at Peter. \u201cWhere is Peter Parker?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter raised his hand and came forward.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt says in the system that you\u2019re an employee, do you have your ID?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s cheeks burned. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell you know the rules, man. Put that on!\u201d Jack\u2019s easy smile turned into wide eyes and an impressed look as he saw the red and gold colour of Peter\u2019s badge. He whistled. \u201cDude, nice!\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter muttered his thanks and avoided everyone\u2019s eyes. When the badges were done being distributed, Jack gestured them all to form a straight line to go through the second security checkpoint. \u201cOkay, so as you can see, the staff entrance is towards the left hand of the reception, and visitor entrance is to the right. There is also a separate vendor and service entrance, and of course, two private entrances for residents of the Tower and VIP guests. Mr Stark also tends to use the penthouse balcony, or any window large enough to fit the Iron Man suit,\u201d he laughed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey Jack, so Peter says he\u2019s an intern here, but you don\u2019t seem to know him?\u201d Flash called out with a faux-curious smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s, like, eight thousand people working here, man,\u201d Jack answered. \u201cAnd I just handle the tours, I meet other staff mostly during lunch or something. But an intern under 18? Never seen that. Our security system knows him though,\u201d he shrugged.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoes Peter need to go through the other security?\u201d Mr Cobbwell wondered. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to leave the group.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh no, he can go either way,\u201d Jack assured him.\n\u00a0\nCindy raised her hand. \u201cWhy were you so impressed with Peter\u2019s badge?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll get right to that in my introduction, let\u2019s just get through security,\u201d Jack smiled, looking a bit impatient. He demonstrated how the scanners worked, and waited on the other side. Security was stronger here, and burly men and women confiscated drones, spyware, EMPs, hidden cameras, and liquids that students had brought along.\n\u00a0\nWhen Peter walked through with his bag, a blue alert flashed on the panel. The security personnel curiously asked to see his badge, and waved him through without a fuss, sharing a look with Jack, who shrugged, equally confused. Despite being used to this, Peter breathed easy. Web fluid would have been hard to explain.\n\u00a0\nOnce they were all through security, Jack gestured towards a table with water and juice bottles and told them to help themselves.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s begin our tour with some basic information about Stark Tower,\u201d Jack began, holding his own water bottle in hand. \u201cThe Tower is the brainchild of our CEO, Pepper Potts, and is chiefly designed by her and our owner, Tony Stark. Opened in 2012, Stark Tower runs completely on arc reactor energy and is not attached to the city\u2019s power grid. It was briefly sold earlier this year, but the deal was cancelled and Stark Tower is now host to the New York arm of Stark Industries. Miss Potts and Mr Stark have moved to the city full time, but for security reasons do not always stay here. The Avengers HQ has been relocated upstate.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter had never been on one of these tours, and was surprised to learn these things. Miss Potts designed the tower? How was she a real person?!\n\u00a0\n\u201cAfter the Chitauri attack in 2012 and then the reveal of HYDRA, security has been the primary concern for Mr Stark. The Tower is now reinforced with multiple layers of material that I cannot disclose, which makes it near indestructible aerially or internally. The airspace within 3 miles is monitored to identify potential airborne threats, and security has been beefed up internally to guard all staff and visitors. No one is allowed entry without a background check, and that includes you guys.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNow I think the girl there asked about ID\u2019s?\u201d Jack nodded to Cindy. \u201cSo as you can see, you all have white badges. That means visitor. Tours for the general public were closed two years ago,\u00a0so now it\u2019s only educational tours, by the way. I, myself, have a purple badge, which means general staff. White badge holders have to be escorted by purple badges or higher, so if I bring my boyfriend to visit, he can\u2019t wander off at any point.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different colours for specialised staff, like green for biotech staff, or cardinal red (\u201cdark red,\u201d he explained at their blank looks) and grey for engineering \u2013 can anyone guess why?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cColours of MIT!\u201d Abraham called out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCorrect!\u201d Jack exclaimed, delighted. \u201cNot many people guess that. I always hear Harvard,\u201d he rolled his eyes. \u201cSo yeah, lots of security levels. Security has black badges, and what else \u2013 oh yeah, service staff has yellow. Anyway, so Mr Parker here\u2013\u201d he pointed at a dismayed Peter, \u201c\u2013has one of the elusive badges, he\u2019s only the second one I\u2019ve seen, honestly. Red is for close personal staff to either Mr Stark or Miss Potts, such as managers, PR agents, lawyers, primary assistants, etc. And gold is for all access! This guy here can go anywhere within the Tower!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe class all looked at Peter in awe, including Ned, who already knew this. Peter noticed Flash was\u00a0suspiciously quiet and was avoiding his eye.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy do you have that clearance, Peter?\u201d asked Alex.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm\u2026I can\u2019t say?\u201d Peter winced.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh yeah man, I don\u2019t think I have clearance to even ask, so I didn\u2019t!\u201d Jack (bless him) deflected the class\u2019 attention.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat colours do the Avengers have?\u201d asked Betty.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, we get this question a lot, but no one seems to know the answer to this,\u201d Jack shrugged. \u201cThey take the private entrance, so their security is handled by the building\u2019s AI, FRIDAY.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis news excited everyone, and Jack had to clap his hands to get silence again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s an AI, yes, she has eyes and ears everywhere. Everyone say hi to FRIDAY!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe class looked around, mostly at the ceiling,\u00a0calling out\u00a0greetings.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello, Midtown School of Science and Technology!\u201d chirped FRIDAY. \u201cHope you enjoy the tour. We\u2019re excited to have you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAfter the excitement had died down a bit, Jack resumed walking.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho\u2019s the other person?\u201d Sally asked. \u201cWith the red and gold ID,\u201d she clarified at Jack\u2019s confused look.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, right! That\u2019s Miss Pott\u2019s personal assistant, Jameela. She\u2019s being trained to take over a high position, I\u2019m sure, but she basically tails Miss Potts and can cover for her in case of emergencies. She\u2019s got her own underlings as well, and she\u2019s badass, a goddess among men\u2026but yeah sorry, back to the tour!\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter made sure to stick close to Mr Cobbwell, who deflected nosy classmates with a look.\n\u00a0\nJack continued leading them through the museum on the first level, which was the history of SI and the company\u2019s goals and side ventures. Peter tried to focus, but this stuff was really boring. The business minded students, however, were taking notes and asking insightful questions about growth and sustainability. He made his way towards the back and checked his text messages.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo Parker,\u201d Flash came up to Peter, trying to look nonchalant. \u201cHow\u2019d you score this gig?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike, are you his secret lovechild or something? We all know Stark slept around, I won\u2019t blame your mom \u2013 hey, I\u2019m talking to you,\u201d Flash hissed, as Peter walked away, furious.\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\nAfter thirty minutes of the first floor and another thirty of the second (which housed the Avengers display), they took the elevator to one of the more exciting floors, Jack talking the whole way. Peter did not envy the guy, he couldn\u2019t imagine talking so much.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo floors three through forty are offices, and yes they\u2019re mega boring but they\u2019re necessary and valued! Floor forty one through sixty are labs, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going!\u201d Jack announced to the cheers of the class. \u201cYes, so we\u2019re headed to fifty, which is robotics, here we are, please follow me, and remember to scan your badges!\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe led them through a hallway to a closed lab with \u2018R3\u2019 on the door, and pressed a button. Peter was thrilled; he spent quite a bit of time in R3, and was excited to show off a bit for Ned and MJ.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy colleague Liam will take over from me now, I\u2019ll see you guys in a bit. Enjoy!\u201d Jack waved and handed them off to a handsome olive-skinned man in his 30\u2019s. Peter could see some of the girls (and Jonah) straighten up and fix their hair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello, Midtown,\u201d Liam welcomed them. The lab had been changed a bit, in order to accommodate the class. There were comfy seats arranged around a holo table, and at the entrance there was a large table to keep cellphones and bottles. \u201cPlease scan your badges, hand over your phones and bottles to the kind bot, and find a seat. Please don\u2019t touch anything!\u201d Peter was the last to enter, and Liam hugged him warmly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you staying back after the tour?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some fun planned, Boss might come by too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr Stark\u2019s back?\u201d Peter asked, thrilled. Tony had been negotiating with the UN for what felt like ages, and had managed to get pardons for most of the rogue Avengers. This time, he had been advocating for Captain Rogers and Bucky Barnes to be allowed to return and a pardon to be granted to both. Peter knew how much these talks drained Mr Stark, who usually hid somewhere for a few days after each one.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Liam replied, a bit quieter. \u201cThe news isn\u2019t out yet, but according to Jameela, he did it!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWHAT?! OH MY GOD!\u201d Peter burst out, all but jumping on Liam, who was just as excited and hugged him back, laughing. \u201cOhhhmygod can you believe\u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\nMr Cobbwell cleared his throat. Peter looked around to see that the class was staring. He blushed and rushed to take a seat, while Liam went to the other side.\n\u00a0\nWith a swipe of his hand, Liam activated the holo table. The class ooh\u2019ed. For fifteen minutes, Liam enthralled Peter\u2019s class with schematics, designs and photographs of the simpler innovations at SI. This time, the entire cohort was engaged, asking Liam about other work in robotics, his own projects, how one could be part of the company, and where there was most need in the field.\n\u00a0\nAfter half an hour\u2019s discussion on robotics, someone finally asked about Peter and his contributions.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, I figured someone would ask, but I\u2019m afraid most of what Peter does in the building is confidential and above my clearance level,\u201d Liam admitted, pointing at his card with cardinal red, grey and blue stripes. \u201cHe\u2019s usually at the lab on 81, and we see him maybe once every two weeks. I can tell you what he does here, if he\u2019s cool with it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nOnce again, Peter had the attention of the whole class as they turned in unison to look at him. He nodded at Liam, too embarrassed to say anything. The class turned back towards Liam as he showed them some of Peter\u2019s recreational work, such as TOAST-E (the communal toaster that now remembered everyone\u2019s preferred toast choice), Rico (the bot that fed you when you were in the zone and couldn\u2019t be bothered) and Squeeze (the cuddly bot that was basically a dog but didn\u2019t need to be taken care of). The class clapped and some even patted Peter on the back after they saw a video demonstration.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, 15 minutes to have a look around, and off to the cafeteria,\u201d Mr Cobbwell announced. Peter rushed Ned to his usual work area, where Squeeze was in sleep mode and charging. At Peter\u2019s tap, the bot activated. They spent a few minutes playing with him before the rest of the class noticed and rushed forward to play.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think we can program him to recognise people without a need for a badge,\u201d Ned suggested, watching the bot.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t figure out how to do that and there\u2019s unwritten rules about messing with others\u2019 work here so no one else has done it either,\u201d Peter admitted.\n\u00a0\nLogging into his account, Peter handed over the code file to Ned, and walked over to Liam.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo what\u2019s gonna happen? Are they coming here? Ohmygod, are they coming here? Will they BE HERE?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCalm down, Peter,\u201d Liam grinned, but he was excited too. \u201cI have no idea, Jameela didn\u2019t give me much more than that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut you\u2019re her boyfriend, get some more info!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, you know Boss personally,\u201d Liam accused, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t just ask\u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh huh, and I can\u2019t just ask either!\u201d\n\u00a0\nA bell dinged somewhere in the lab and Liam paused to consider what it could be for. Peter could hear Luke muttering, \u201cThis is it, we\u2019re gonna die, it was an alarm,\u201d and tuned him out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight!\u201d\u00a0Liam\u00a0remembered. \u201cTime for you lot to go to one of the cafeterias for some brunch! Now remember, food\u2019s free so go wild. Try the croissants, they\u2019re my favourite!\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s class was cheerfully ushered out, back towards the elevators, where Jack met them again. They were led to 45, which housed the nearest cafeteria, spanning half the floor. The class was given forty minutes to grab some food and use the toilets.\n\u00a0\nPeter took this time to talk to Mr Cobbwell, who was in line for crepes. \u201cMr Cobbwell, is it okay if I stay back here after the tour, or are we doing anything back at school?\u201d At his teacher\u2019s hesitant look, he hurried to say, \u201cOnly, I come here after school on Thursdays anyway and it\u2019s quite a waste of time. I can call my Aunt if you need her permission!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind, Peter,\u201d My Cobbwell said with a sad smile. \u201cBut it\u2019s not up to me. There\u2019s your safety to consider, and I don\u2019t know any of these people. You\u2019re a minor, and I can\u2019t leave you here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut I come here every week!\u201d Peter protested. \u201cYou know my internship is real!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike I said, Peter, I don\u2019t mind it. But I am responsible for your safety while you\u2019re here. How can I verify anyone\u2019s identity here?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, um,\u201d Peter was forced to agree, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right, thanks anyway, sir.\u201d He walked back to Ned, who looked at him hopefully. Peter shook his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYoung Peter!\u201d came a call from - well, everywhere all at once. Which could only mean one person.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr Thor!\u201d exclaimed Peter, surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were here! Oof!\u201d he muttered as Thor enthusiastically patted him on his shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell I wasn\u2019t, but a wizard made a portal and now here I am!\u201d said Thor jovially, as if that explained anything. \u201cI asked FRIDAY if anyone was here but everyone seems to have gone missing, but then she said you\u2019re here, so\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight! Great!\u201d Peter nodded.\n\u00a0\nThere was silence as both Peter and Thor tried to think of something to say. Peter could hear camera phone shutters and a couple of mumbled \u201cawkward!\u201d comments. The SI staff that was around was staring too, since the 45th floor never saw any Avengers action, being at least 5 cafeterias away from the former Avengers residence floors.\n\u00a0\nThor looked around, and beamed at the children. \u201cAre these your friends?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, yeah sorry, I\u2019m on a field trip with my class! It\u2019s like sightseeing,\u201d Peter explained, as Thor nodded sagely. \u201cThis is my friend Ned, and this is MJ.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello, Ned and MJ!\u201d Thor waved.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d was all Ned could say, and even MJ seemed a bit starstruck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr Stark has arrived,\u201d came FRIDAY\u2019s voice from the nearest speaker. The news had a sudden effect on the staff, who rushed to finish their food and get back to work.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell then young Peter, I shall take your leave,\u201d Thor smiled. He went up to a food counter where a lady silently handed him a massive tray of food. He held it singlehandedly and waved at the occupants of the floor with a grin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBye!\u201d \u201cSee you, Thor!\u201d \u201cBye Mr Thor\u201d chimed everyone enthusiastically. As soon as the elevator doors shut, there was a burst of noise as everyone\u00a0shrieked\u00a0and fawned over The Hottest Avenger.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOhhhhhmygod ohmygod ohmygodddd,\u201d chanted Ned, pulling Peter\u2019s arm so hard it hurt. \u201cTHE Thor knows my name! He said my name and said hello Ned and I have to call my mom she will DIE! I love you so much Peter you\u2019re the best!\u201d\n\u00a0\nLaughing, Peter decided to text May an update too.\n11:40\n\nTHOR WAS HERE he said hi to me and everyone is so hyped!\n\n\nI think he broke Ned\n\n\nMr Stark is here btw, I think he did it\n\n\u00a0\n11:41\n\nNice! I might drop in if he\u2019s still around ;)\n\n\nDid what?\n\n\nOhh wait, did he really do it?\n\n\nOMG\n\n\u00a0\n11:42\n\nYes! I was gonna ask you to call school and tell them to let me stay here after but Mr C says no :(\n\n\u00a0\n11:42\n\nHow come?\n\n\u00a0\n11:43\n\nSays can\u2019t verify these people and so it\u2019s not safe etc.\n\n\u00a0\n11:44\n\nHe\u2019s right\n\n\nI\u2019ll try something hang on\n\n\u00a0\n11:45\n\nWhat?\n\n\nMay\n\n\nMay what?\n\n\nMay!!\n\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\nAfter brunch, they were herded to another lab, this time on 42. They had a look at the more commercial technology, like StarkPhones and tablets, and were allowed to fiddle with older prototypes.\n\u00a0\nA lady named Alison gave them worksheets to crack, and then handed over information packets on Stark Internships.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMost people think there\u2019s only STEM internships here, but really, there\u2019s all kinds,\u201d explained Alison. \u201cMarketing, business, PR, management of different kinds, and so on.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Miss Alison,\u201d piped up Flash. The class groaned. Peter could only sigh in anticipation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes?\u201d Alison asked, bemused at the response of the class.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow would a 15 year old get an internship opportunity?\u201d Flash asked, with a slightly maniacal look in his eye.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, internships are for college students only,\u201d mused Alison, \u201cSo maybe a prodigy who was studying at university might get one? But that\u2019s quite rare, honestly. Those tend to prefer academia over practical applications.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo how did Peter \u2013\u00a0raise your hand, Parker \u2013 get his internship?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter could seriously kill Flash, because now the rest of the class had started to look interested as well. No one doubted his claim, but they all wanted more information. And by the look of it, Alison was just as clueless.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI- I don\u2019t-\u201d she stammered. She looked at Peter\u2019s badge and was even more flustered. \u201cYoung man,\u201d she started, and Peter could see his life flashing before his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAccess restricted,\u201d came FRIDAY\u2019s voice over the speakers. \u201cYou are not authorised to question Mr Parker.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry, FRIDAY!\u201d called out Alison, laughing nervously, looking sideways at Peter. \u201cI can\u2019t help you, young man,\u201d she said to Flash. \u201cThis is above my level.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter could feel the burning curiosity of his entire class. At this point, even Mr Cobbwell had forgotten himself and was staring at Peter.\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\nAs the tour was winding up, it was nearing half past two. Jack handed them all personalised bags with SI goodies, which included t-shirts, an arc reactor shaped lamp, StarkPhone covers, and a really cool travel mug that showed War Machine if the liquid inside was cold, and Iron Man if the contents were hot.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou may use the washrooms before you leave, I know it\u2019s a while to get back to your school. Please don\u2019t leave any belongings behind! I hope you\u2019ve all had a good time on today\u2019s tour,\u201d said Jack with a big smile. \u201cEnjoy the rest of your day!\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s class clapped for Jack, as Mr Cobbwell gave him his thanks.\n\u00a0\nAs they were about to head outside the tower to wait for their bus, one of the elevators opened and out came Mr Stark, talking rapid fire to two staff members who were running to keep up with him. As the class looked at Tony Stark in all his glory (\u201cI thought he\u2019d be taller,\u201d Betty whispered to Justin), Mr Stark walked right up to the group.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter! We\u2019re having a party, where are you going?\u201d Tony asked him. He held his hand up in a gesture to his minions, who immediately backed up to give Mr Stark space.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, hi Mr Stark,\u201d Peter replied nervously.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, hi, how was your tour, etc. Party, where are we at?\u201d said Tony, looking at Peter\u2019s classmates and nodding at Ned. \u201cYou too, Ned, coming?\u201d Ned squealed and looked beseechingly at Peter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll \u2013 we\u2019ll \u2013 have to go to school and come back, for safety reasons\u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re safe with me, I\u2019m Iron Man,\u201d replied Tony dismissively. \u201cYou, teacher,\u201d he addressed Mr Cobbwell. \u201cYou\u2019re cool with it, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, yes, yes Dr Stark,\u201d stammered Mr Cobbwell, starstruck. \u201cIt was more that I didn\u2019t know anyone, but you, I mean, you\u2026\u201d he drifted off.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI like you, teacher,\u201d Mr Stark smiled widely. \u201cNot many people remember my doctorates. Come here, where\u2019s your phone?\u201d He took Mr Cobbwell\u2019s phone and took a selfie with the teacher, who looked about ready to faint. \u201cClass photo?\u201d Mr Stark suggested, snapping his fingers at his minions, one of whom ran ahead with her phone while the other hurriedly arranged Peter\u2019s class so that they\u2019d all be visible in the photo.\n\u00a0\nOnce multiple photos had been taken (\u201cNow make a silly face,\u201d Mr Stark (TONY STARK) had called out, to the students\u2019 delight), Mr Stark gave the class a big wave and took Peter\u2019s elbow, ushering him towards an unmarked elevator. Peter grabbed Ned\u2019s hand and pulled him along, both calling out thanks and a farewell to their teacher. The minions got off on floor thirty, which said LEGAL when Peter peeked out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Mr Stark,\u00a0this is so nice of you, like you didn\u2019t have to come all the way, we could have come back, it\u2019s not a bother, and how did you even know we were here, did FRIDAY tell you?\u201d Peter rambled. \u201cYou look so tired wow, you just came back, right? Are you jetlagged? You should nap, we\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019ll take Ned to the game room\u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cKid,\u201d Tony interrupted, suddenly looking exhausted as he\u00a0shooed them out of the elevator on floor 85. \u201cI was about to nap, your Aunt called me and made me come get you. It\u2019s fine,\u201d he waved off Peter\u2019s guilty apology, \u201cI\u2019m happy to do it. But you\u2019re right, I need a nap before the party. Go play.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs the doors closed, Peter and Ned shared an incredulous look.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour life, dude,\u201d gushed Ned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy life, dude,\u201d Peter agreed.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
