    "text": "Stiles glares at the clock, his Sunday morning appointment now twenty minutes late. He sips at his tea and double checks his leatherbound appointment book again, reassuring himself for the third time that he has the date and time right. Sunday the seventeenth, nine am, Derek Hale, beta werewolf. The appointment is written in his own hasty scrawl, a stark contrast to Lydia\u2019s neat print filling the rest of the pages; he scheduled this one himself, because the client\u2019s sister, Laura, an alpha, had the connections to track down Stiles\u2019 direct phone number.\nShe wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer when he informed her that there was an eighteen-month waiting period for his services, and after a week of increasingly aggressive-but-not-quite-outright-threatening phone calls, he had relented and scheduled a weekend appointment, the first time ever in the seven years since he publicly shared his gift and opened Soul Stiles. And now, here he is on his precious day off after a particularly exhausting, fifty-hour workweek, and this alpha woman\u2019s brother has the balls to be late.\nIrritated, Stiles closes the calendar and tosses it aside, reaching for another leatherbound book, this one a simple journal, one of dozens just like it filed away on shelves in the basement, hand-written records of all of his appointments since his very first. He uses the time to get caught up on recording Friday\u2019s sessions, quickly jotting down the basics of his visions for each client.\n\nJoaquin R., male human. A female pixie named Veronica, with blonde hair and green eyes. Will meet in two years.\n\n\nAlexandria L., female faerie. A genderqueer witch named Rylan. Crying of Lot 49 tattoo on their neck. Met thirteen months ago.\n\n\nMatt M., male beta werewolf. A male werewolf named Connor with black hair and blue eyes. Will meet in four months.\n\n\nLucinda F., female human. A male vampire named Marcos with a beard. Will meet in thirty-two years.\n\nStiles sighs heavily writing that entry, annotating it with a small x to indicate that he didn\u2019t tell Lucinda, a sweet, twenty-three year old elementary school teacher, that she wouldn\u2019t meet her soulmate until she was fifty-five years old. He rarely withholds information from his clients, but he just couldn\u2019t bear the look of shocked disappointment she would have made, so he lied and told her the vision wasn\u2019t very strong, that he only saw his face and his name but didn\u2019t get a sense of when they would meet. She was still incredibly grateful, of course. His clients always are.\nIn the nine since years since he discovered his gift and in the seven years he\u2019s been in business, Stiles has never been wrong, and has never failed to see someone's soulmate when he touches them.\nHalf-witch, half-human, Stiles first discovered his ability when he was eighteen, just after igniting his spark after years of training with his mother to be a mage. They were prepping a spell in the herb room in the back of Stilinski Spellwork, and his magic already buzzing, Stiles placed a hand on her shoulder, reaching across the workbench for chamomile flowers, and he was struck with his first vision: his long-dead father, the man whose face he only knew from photographs. He had died when his mother was pregnant, killed in the line of duty trying to mediate a vampire territory dispute.\nBut he image of his father that he saw in his vision wasn\u2019t of any of the photos he had grown up with; his dad was younger, and smiling in a way that none of the photos had ever captured, and Stiles, his magic coursing through him stronger than he\u2019d ever felt, suddenly just knew that he was looking at a man named John, twenty-five years ago, seeing him the very first time he laid eyes on Claudia Zoldak, witch, high priestess of the goddess Nyx, and his soulmate.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve found your gift,\u201d his mother had smiled when he told her. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly rare, Stiles. There hasn\u2019t been a natural soulseeker for generations. Many think the spark for it has died out.\u201d\nStiles had fallen heavily to a stool, trying to wrap his head around this unexpected development. Loki, his familiar, a black cat with glowing green eyes, hopped up into his lap, purring and offering comfort.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a fundamental law of magic, and thus the universe, that everyone has a soulmate, that the mysterious chaos of fate and magic, obscure and vast, has one fundamental goal: to bring soulmates together, two sundered halves of a dying star cast to this plane in search of reunion, as the faerie legends say. The ability to glimpse into that chaos \u2013 to touch someone and see their soulmate and know when they\u2019ll meet, or if they already have \u2013 that\u2019s a rare and valuable skill indeed.\nTogether with his mother and his best friend Lydia, Stiles researched and practiced for two years before opening his own office across the alley from his mother\u2019s shop. They perfected the right combination of herbs and charms for spells to control when he accesses the visions and to sharpen them, to make his memories of them more reliable. There had been rumors of his abilities before he opened for business, of course \u2013 the witch community is notorious for its gossip \u2013 but there had still been quite an uproar when he publicly confirmed them.\nWerewolves, vampires, pixies, mermaids, selkies, witches, mages, banshees, humans \u2013 ensouled creatures from all over the world were clamoring to meet with him, to pay whatever he asked, for his help in recognizing the one person in the world made just for them.\nIt\u2019s been a lucrative and rewarding business, helping others find their soulbond. Stiles loves that he can help people in this way, that he offers them something rare and fragile: hope and reassurance. Everyone knows that finding your soulmate doesn\u2019t automatically mean happily ever after \u2013 his father\u2019s untimely death only seven years after he and his mother met reminds Stiles of that every day. And, like any relationship, a soulbonded pair has figure out how to make a relationship work for them. But even so, the love between soulmates is life-altering, deeper than any other love known.\u00a0\nNot that Stiles would know personally, of course.\nThere\u2019s only one drawback to his rare gift: it doesn\u2019t work on himself. Stiles can look into the past or future to see the one person in all the world destined for anyone, but when he turns his vision inward and tries to see his own partner, he\u2019s greeted with nothing but dark silence. He long ago resigned himself to the irony of this and tries to be satisfied with waiting to find his soulmate the old-fashioned way, a first kiss that sparks and awakens the hidden bond.\nOf course, he\u2019d have to actually be dating to have a chance of that happening, and he\u2019s only been on a handful of mediocre dates since he opened his business, so the chances that Stiles is going to find his mate any time soon are pretty slim. (Fortunately he\u2019s friends with an incubus who he helped find his succubus mate, and they gladly welcome him into their bed whenever he\u2019s in need of more than just his own hands and toys.)\nThe bell over the door rings and Stiles finishes writing his last entry for Friday before looking up at the tall figure stepping inside his small office. \u201cYou\u2019re late, Mr. Hale,\u201d he snaps, flipping the seeking journal closed. \u201cNo one has ever been late to an appointment with me,\u201d he adds, surprised at how much he\u2019s letting his irritation show.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be here at all,\u201d a rough, tightly-controlled voice snaps back, and Stiles finally looks up, brows arched up in surprised, because that\u2019s new too.\nHis eyes go wide when he takes in the werewolf standing before him, crossing his worn leather-clad arms over his broad chest, glaring down at where Stiles is sitting behind his desk. He\u2019s easily the most attractive man Stiles has ever seen, all sharp edges and stark contrasts; jeweled eyes and night-black hair, angular jaw and cheekbones and a dense, soft-looking beard. Under his jacket Derek is wearing a snug-fitting white v-neck, outlines of his chiseled chest visible through the thin fabric, neckline deep enough to show an impressively alluring patch of chest hair that makes Stiles' mouth water.\nHis aura is vibrant and primal, tinged lightly with blue that Stiles knows must mean his eyes are the same, and he tries not to let his curiosity show, a difficult feat, given how he\u2019s already working hard to hide his attraction. That\u2019s a futile effort, of course; Derek\u2019s a werewolf and can surely smell his interest.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a seat, Mr. Hale,\u201d Stiles says, standing up and walking out from behind his desk towards the comfortable, blue-velvet couch where he holds most of his meetings. He gestures for Derek to sit. \u201cSince you are here, and since your sister already paid my fee, you might as well, right?\u201d He puts his hands up in contrition and smiles, trying to make up for his abrupt greeting.\nStiles walks to the table across from the couch and clicks on the electric kettle for tea, feeling Derek\u2019s bright eyes on his back while he fills two metal strainers with leaves and waits for the water to heat. He tries to steady his slightly shaking hands, unsettled by just how unsettled Derek\u2019s presence makes him feel, like his skin is too tight, his blood too hot. His body is thrumming with magic, and he\u2019s sure Derek can smell that on him too, and he rolls his shoulders, feeling even more self-conscious. Rude, late, and here under threat from his alpha: it doesn\u2019t seem to matter at all to his spark (or his dick), his magic (and his dick) awakening and thrumming wildly in the werewolf\u2019s presence. Well, the thinks, pouring the hot water, at least this will be an easy vision to access, if his magic is already so responsive to Derek.\nThe werewolf is still standing with his arms crossed when Stiles turns around with two fresh mugs of hibiscus tea, setting them both down on the coffee table and taking a seat on one end of the couch. Derek huffs and rolls his eyes, but he sits on the other end, his eyes tracking up and down Stiles' body in a way that makes him flush with heat that has nothing to do with the steaming mug of tea. \u201cSo you\u2019re here because your sister is making you,\u201d Stiles begins, voice shaking just a bit. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to be here?\u201d Stiles usually starts his sessions off with the question why are you here, but it\u2019s abundantly clear that Derek\u2019s not his typical client.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really need to do this,\u201d Derek mutters. \u201cCan you just do your magic trick and tell me whatever it is you\u2019re supposed to so I can tell Laura and get her off my back?\u201d\n\u201cMy \u2018magic trick,\u2019 is actually a carefully honed skill,\u201d Stiles bristles, last vestiges of professionalism dissipating. \u201cAnd it takes some time. So why don\u2019t you stop acting like you were raised by actual wolves and take off your damn coat and drink your fucking tea, okay?\u201d\nMuch to his surprise and relief, Derek smiles, and maybe even laughs a little, but it\u2019s so quiet and Stiles\u2019 heart is pounding because he very easily could have just gotten his throat ripped out. Derek shrugs out of his jacket, which he tosses over the arm of the couch with a rippling flex of his bicep that strains his sleeve and that Stiles thinks is wholly unnecessary and terribly distracting. Derek picks up the teacup, knife-edged nose twitching adorably when he smells it before taking a delicate sip.\nLoki, who usually observes his appointments with reserved disinterest from the windowsill, and who always makes himself scarce when werewolves are afoot, leaps up to the couch, sniffing curiously at Derek\u2019s arm, surprising them both.\n\u201cSo is this how this works?\u201d Derek asks, startling Stiles from his reverie. \u201cYou watch me drink tea?\u201d\u00a0\nStiles tries to hide his blush in his own teacup, looking away from Derek\u2019s smirk and raised eyebrow. \u201cUh, well, usually, I talk to my clients a bit. The vision is clearer if I have a better sense of who you are. Beyond just what I read in your aura, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cYou read auras?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do. I\u2019m a mage.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what does my aura tell you about me,\u201d Derek asks, the casualness in his voice sounding a little forced. \u00a0\n\u201cThat you\u2019re a werewolf, and a beta,\u201d he answers. \u201cBut I already knew that. You have a good heart, you\u2019re reserved, and sensitive. And your eyes, your wolf eyes, are blue.\u201d\nDerek seems surprised. \u201cYou can tell that? And you know what it means?\u201d\nStiles nods.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not scared of me?\u201d\n\u201cScared of you? All it means is that you carry deep guilt, a wound so deep it\u2019s coloring your soul.\u201d\n\u201cFor taking an innocent life.\u201d Derek tenses visibly, and Stiles is momentarily worried about his antique teacup that his great-grandmother brought to the States from Krakow.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a narrow definition of the mythology,\u201d Stiles presses, even though this is clearly a tense subject for Derek. \u201cWould you like to tell me about it?\u201d\nDerek scoffs. \u201cMy sister paid you to find my soulmate, not for therapy.\u201d\n\u201cAre you really surprised that they\u2019re all that different?\u201d\nDerek cocks his head at him, expression softening, looking very much like a confused puppy and Stiles has the ridiculous urge to scratch behind his ears, despite the fact that he\u2019s fairly certain such an action would result in the loss of at least one limb. \u201cWhat do you mean?\"\n\u201cPeople come to me because they want reassurance that they\u2019ll recognize their soulmate when they meet them, or find out if they\u2019ve already met them. They\u2019re looking for hope, for something that\u2019s going to help them feel settled.\u201d Stiles shrugs. \u201cAnd when you add to that the fact the visions are much stronger after I get to know you, after we talk for awhile, yeah. This is a kind of therapy.\u201d\nDerek puts his tea down and crosses his arms again, relaxing into the back of the couch. \u201cI just want my sister to stop bothering me about dating. I don\u2019t need to talk anything out.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, big guy,\u201d Stiles sighs, mirroring Derek\u2019s pose. \u201cThem\u2019s the rules.\u201d He neglects to tell Derek that with the way his spark is reacting to him, it likely won\u2019t take more than brush of their hands right now for him to have a crystal-clear vision of the incredibly lucky person who will some day kiss Derek and know what forever feels like.\nThe thought twists sourly in his gut, and Stiles realizes that for the very first time, he\u2019s jealous of whomever he\u2019s about to have a vision of, Derek\u2019s soulmate, sure that they're as beautiful as him, he thinks bitterly.\n\u201cHer name was Paige,\u201d Derek says quietly, pulling Stiles from his confusing thoughts. \u201cWe were fifteen, and we were in love. We weren\u2019t soulmates but we didn't care.\u201d Derek palms his beard, sighing heavily, brows furrowed. \u201cShe was human, and she wanted the bite. I arranged for an alpha to give it to her. It didn\u2019t take.\u201d\n\u201cDerek, that\u2019s hardly your fault,\u201d Stiles says, unsure of how Derek will react to his attempt at comfort. \u201cThat\u2019s fairly common, humans not surviving the bite. You\u2019re not responsible for her death.\u201d\n\u201cI killed her,\u201d Derek says, eyes searing into his, flashing luminescent blue. \u201cShe was in so much pain and she begged me. The bite was going to\u2026but I did it.\u201d The glow fades from his eyes, but he still stares him down, as if he\u2019s challenging Stiles to try and comfort him now.\n\u00a0\u201cThat sounds like an act of mercy,\u201d he says softly.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t change the fact that she\u2019s dead because of me. Just like my family.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 eyes go wide. \u201cYour family?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAfter Paige\u2026I slept around a lot. Men and women, most of them older. There was this human woman named Kate. She turned out to be a hunter. She burned our house down. My entire pack died, except for Laura and our uncle Peter. Eleven people.\u201d\n\u201cMy gods,\u201d Stiles whispers. \u201cDerek, that\u2019s not your fault either. Hunters are disgusting, brutal. You\u2019re lucky to have escaped.\u201d\u00a0\nDerek goes on like he hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cThat was a long time ago. Almost ten years. I haven\u2019t really dated since. And when Laura wouldn\u2019t stop bothering me about it, I thought she\u2019d leave me along if I told her I was waiting for my soulmate.\u201d One corner of his wide, pretty mouth crooks up in something like a wry smile. \u201cShe called my bluff. I didn\u2019t know she knew of a soulseeker.\u201d\n\u201cSo you really don\u2019t want to find your soulmate?\u201d Professionally, Stiles understands those who don\u2019t want advanced knowledge of their soulmate, but personally, given his inability to have a choice in the matter himself, he can\u2019t believe Derek isn\u2019t even a little curious.\n\u201cI don\u2019t deserve it,\u201d Derek mutters, so soft Stiles can barely hear him.\n\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles starts, unsure of what he\u2019s going to say. He comforts his clients often, it\u2019s the nature of his work, of his gift, but he finds himself at a loss for how to even begin to help heal the broken man next to him.\n\u201cCan we just get on with it?\u201d Derek asks, voice sharp again. \u201cYou know more about me now than my own sister, does, okay? Let\u2019s just do this so I can make her happy at least.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Stiles relents, knowing it\u2019s not really his place to try and help him recover from his crippling guilt, but strangely, he wants to. He pushes the urge aside and works on focusing and settling his magic. What he can do, is offer \u00a0Derek some hope, even if he says he doesn\u2019t care, even if Stiles still hasn\u2019t gotten control of his inexplicable jealousy. \u00a0\u00a0\nStiles scoots forward on the couch, reaching across the low coffee table for the large wooden spellbox, another family heirloom, and slides it closer. He waves his palm over the charmed clasp, the protection rune tattooed on his palm glowing hot. Derek makes a small noise of interest and leans forward, watching Stiles flip open the lid. The box is divided into a dozen squares, each one holding a few small pouches of charmed herbs, color-coded by the silk ribbons tying them closed. He grabs one of the purple ones and closes the box, waving his palm over the clasp again to lock it, feeling Derek\u2019s eyes on him, his skin tingling with sensation. \u201cMy visions are innate,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut a focusing spell helps me read auras more deeply, and that makes them clearer and easier to remember. And different herb mixes work better for different species,\u201d he elaborates, untying the pouch and pulling loose the ribbon. Most of his clients like to keep the ribbon as a keepsake, but he doesn\u2019t offer it to Derek.\nHe pours the herbs into a small worn stone dish, talking to steady his nerves as much as to explain what he\u2019s doing. \u201cAfter the spell, I\u2019ll take your hands, just for a few seconds, okay?\u201d Derek moves closer and nods. Stiles snaps his fingers over the bowl, flame sparking to life and igniting the herb mixture. Out of the corner of his eyes he can see Derek\u2019s eyebrows go up in surprise, but he keeps his gaze on the thick plume of curling white smoke. He leans over it and inhales, then closes his eyes and quickly speaks the spell, in Polish, the tattoos on his hands and forearms glowing, thrumming with magic.\nWhen he opens his eyes, he knows they\u2019re glowing purple, and he turns towards Derek, watching carefully for his reaction, which is a further raising of his ridiculously thick and expressive eyebrows. \u201cOh,\u201d he mumbles, his own eyes flashing blue again.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles smiles. \u201cPretty cool, huh?\u201d Derek snorts, but he offers a shy smile. The focusing spell designed precisely to tap more deeply into werewolf auras lets him see more of Derek with his glowing eyes, and Stiles lets out his own small noise of surprise. Derek\u2019s soulprint is fully revealed to him now, his gorgeous face haloed with the wispy-edged, blue-tinged outlines of a wolf, regal and majestic, primal. Derek has the rare ability to fully shift into an actual wolf, and judging by the ephemeral faintness of the aura, he\u2019s never accessed that part of himself. It\u2019s entirely possible that Derek doesn\u2019t even know that he can, Stiles realizes, watching Derek\u2019s wolf face, his real wolf face, fade and shimmer across his expectant and noble human features. Stiles' chest twists in pain for him, for his wholly misplaced guilt, his self-hatred, for this deeply, deeply good man wounded so young that he has no idea what he\u2019s capable of or how extraordinary he is.\u00a0\nSighing, Stiles reaches for Derek\u2019s big hands and holds them, cradled in his broad lap, his skin fighting up even more at Derek's touch. He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes, preparing himself to look for Derek\u2019s soulmate. Whoever you are, he thinks, you better be worth him.\n\n~*~\n\nDarkness. A blank wall.\nAbsolutely nothing.\nStiles squeezes Derek\u2019s hands harder, moves his fingers up his palms to circle around his wrists, breathes deep and looks again. His magic is still vibrating through him in strong, steady pulses, flowing into Derek, and it feels like every other vision he\u2019s had, but he doesn\u2019t see anyone. He doesn\u2019t see anything. His spark feels stronger than it ever has, but it\u2019s as if it can only go so far into Derek\u2019s aura before it\u2019s snapped off, snuffed out, shut out.\nDerek makes a noise of confusion and Stiles realizes that\u2019s he\u2019s been clutching at his wrists a little desperately, that he\u2019s been holding on to him for far too long. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, gasping, letting him go and opening his eyes. \u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t see anything,\u201d he stutters, utterly confused.\n\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026this has never\u2026are you blocking me?\u201d There are all kinds of spells to resist magic and strengthen psychic barriers, but it doesn\u2019t make sense that Derek would actually tell him the truth about not wanting to know and then use something like that.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even know how to do that, Stiles, if I even knew what that meant.\u201d Derek sounds irritated, but almost resigned too, like this proves something. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t see anyone?\u201d\nStiles slumps back against the arm of the couch. \u201cDerek, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. It was just\u2026blank.\u201d\nDerek stands up and pulls on his jacket, features going harsh again. \u201cExpect another phone call from Laura, because she\u2019s not going to believe me when I tell her. She might even drive all the way up here herself.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you going to tell her,\u201d Stiles asks, still dazed and confused about the blank vision, and now by the fact that Derek\u2019s apparently leaving, his aura darkening with pain before his still-enhanced eyes.\n\u201cThat I don\u2019t have a soulmate,\u201d Derek snaps, stalking to the door.\n\u201cDerek, come on,\u201d Stiles argues, desperation creeping into his voice, rising to his feet. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. Everyone has a soulmate.\u201d\nA rush of cool, damp air swirls in when Derek swings the door open, the chime of the bell harsh and bitter. \u201cThink about it, Stiles,\u201d he says, pausing at the threshold, shadow falling across his gorgeous features, elegant even in anger. \u201cHave you ever had a blank vision before? What else could it mean?\u201d\nBefore Stiles can fumble for a response, Derek is gone, the door slamming shut behind him.\n~*~\nLoki mewling at him brings him to his senses, and Stiles pulls himself from his stunned daze, the cat glaring at him like he\u2019s a complete and utter idiot. Stiles scrambles out the door, hoping he\u2019s not too late to catch Derek, heart pounding.\nDerek\u2019s questions echo loudly in his mind as he stumbles into the narrow alley outside his office.\n\nHave you ever had a blank vision before? What else could it mean?\n\nIt\u2019s been so long since Stiles tried looking inward for his own soulmate that he had forgotten what it looked like, what it felt like.\nDarkness. A blank wall.\nAbsolutely nothing.\nStiles stumbles over his feet in his haste to catch Derek, arms flailing wildly to regain his balance as he looks up and down the narrow alley, nearly dizzy with the wild rush of stunned excitement.\nHe knew his gift didn\u2019t work on himself, and Stiles had resigned himself to waiting for that soulmate-revealing first kiss of legend and fairy tale.\nBut he never thought about what that would mean if he ever tried to read his soulmate.\nIt had rained all night and even though it\u2019s midmorning the sky is dark with heavy clouds, and Stiles is starting to shiver when he spots Derek at the end of the alley, about to get into a sleek black sports car, still looking angry and impossibly sexy.\n\u201cDerek, wait!\u201d Stiles calls out and jogs toward him, splashing in the puddles in the uneven cobblestones. \u201cPlease don\u2019t go.\u201d He slows to a walk and comes around the front of the Camaro to stand in front of him. \u201cI think I figured it out,\u201d he says, smiling, feeling more and more sure with each step closer to him, his spark shimmering through him with renewed force.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to figure out, Stiles,\u201d Derek sighs. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see anyone. I don\u2019t have a soulmate. That\u2019s how it should be.\u201d\nHe crosses his arms again, resolute. Stiles steps closer. \u201cCan I try something?\u201d he asks, knowing that Derek needs more than words to truly believe it. Stiles\u2019 voice is steady, but it\u2019s also barely a whisper, like Derek\u2019s a wild animal he\u2019s trying not to spook, his eyes falling to his slightly-open mouth.\nDerek nods, barely, and Stiles steps closer still, pressing against his crossed arms until he relents and lets them drop to his sides. When he does, Stiles grins and falls against him, full up against his warm, broad chest. Slow and tentative, he lifts his hands to Derek\u2019s face, gently rustling his beard, so wonderfully soft yet coarse. His eyes are glittering, opalescent green so beautiful Stiles is sure they have their own spark, and he runs his thumb over Derek\u2019s bottom lip, gentling his mouth open more, a glint of glittering magic flashing at the touch.\nIt\u2019s unlike any kiss he\u2019s ever had, and not just because it\u2019s accompanied by the shaking, bone-deep rush of magic that\u2019s unlike any he\u2019s ever felt; the awakening and recognition of their soulbond courses through them, shifting Stiles\u2019 world on its axis and settling it back into place with a new, Derek-shaped center of gravity. But Stiles has also never been kissed at once so tender yet so passionate, Derek\u2019s lips soft and gentle, his tongue insistent and feverish. And then there are arms, strong, achingly beautiful arms, circling his waist, pulling him tighter, and a happy, desperate groan escaping from Derek\u2019s chest.\nWhen they finally break apart, magic crackling between them, Derek\u2019s eyes are shimmering blue, and Stiles knows his own are purple again. Derek stares at him, happy it seems, but also clearly freaked out. Stiles smiles softly and takes his hand in his. \u201cI live above the office,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come up and I\u2019ll make us breakfast and we can talk, okay? Get to know each other better?\u201d\nDerek nods, looking away. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you,\u201d he whispers, awed and achingly vulnerable.\n\u201cHey, watch it,\u201d Stiles warns, playfully admonishing, nudging him softly on the chin, making him meet his gaze again. \u201cThat\u2019s my soulmate you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\n~*~\n\nStiles leads him up his small, cluttered studio, an uncanny mix of awkward nerves and familiarity buzzing between them now, their souls knowing each other but not their hearts, not yet.\nHis apartment feels even smaller with Derek in it, his furniture even shabbier. Stiles can afford a bigger place and nicer things, of course, can afford a whole hell of a lot more than that, in fact, but he simply doesn\u2019t care to.\u00a0\u201cSorry about the mess,\u201d he mutters, blushing as he clears away the dirty cereal bowls on the coffee table, adding them to the pile in the sink. \u201cMake yourself comfortable.\u201d\nDerek takes off his coat and walks slowly through the studio, nostrils twitching, eyes taking in the overstuffed bookshelves and Stiles\u2019 one extravagance, his large flatscreen tv. The bed, unmade, is shoved in the corner opposite the kitchen, separated from the couch and kitchen by a makeshift wall made of antique stained-glass windows strung together with wire and suspended from the ceiling. Derek drifts towards it, licking his lips, and Stiles feels his cheeks go red. He had a long, lazy jerk this morning, coming all over his sheets that he hasn\u2019t had a chance to wash yet, and there\u2019s no doubt at all that Derek can smell it. And, by the way he\u2019s staring at the bed, transfixed, it\u2019s a scent he finds enticing, to say the least.\nDerek lets out a low growl and turns on his heel suddenly, blinking hard. \u201cYou\u2019re dating a werewolf,\u201d he snaps, a note of accusation in his voice that seems to surprise even him.\nStiles looks up from where he was trying to hide just how many dirty dishes are in his sink. \u201cWhat? Huh? I\u2019m not dating anyone. I haven\u2019t in like, ages. You\u2019re smelling Scott, he\u2019s one of my best friends. He\u2019s a beta too. Bitten though, not born.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re sleeping with him though?\u201d Derek sounds less irritated now, but still not pleased, and Stiles has never been one for jealousy, but he has to admit that it\u2019s pretty cute on Derek. \u201cI mean, his scent is all over your bed,\u201d he adds meekly.\nStiles raises his eyebrows, impressed at Derek\u2019s skill. \u201cDude, that was over a week ago. We ate enchanted mushrooms and marathoned Archer. Scott passed out. He stole my bed and I slept on the couch because the bite cured his asthma but not his disgusting snoring.\u201d\nDerek smiles, relieved. \u201cOh. I\u2019m sorry, I shouldn't pry.\"\n\u201cNot a problem, big guy. I mean, we\u2019re getting to know each other, right?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like some more tea? Or I could make coffee. Or hot chocolate? Shot of wolfsbane tequila?\u201d\nDerek smiles again, big and bright this time, and Stiles\u2019 stomach does this twisting, swooping thing that he\u2019s pretty sure would happen even if he weren\u2019t his soulmate, because Derek\u2019s smile is well\u2026just as blindingly perfect and gorgeous as the rest of him, made all the more extraordinary by the sharp contrast it provides from his normally stern gaze. His soulmate is a study in contradictions, Stiles realizes, so many rough edges to hide just how gentle he really is.\n\u00a0\u201cActually, hot chocolate sounds really good,\u201d he says, walking over to sit on the couch. \u201cIf that was a serious offer.\u201d\n\u201cIt was!\u201d Stiles grins wildly, pleased to have something to do besides stare at Derek and feel awkward about his slovenly habits. \u201cIt\u2019s my grandmother\u2019s recipe. You\u2019ll love it. Even though I can never get it to taste like hers. Mine\u2019s still pretty good though.\u201d Stiles flits around his small kitchen, gathering up supplies, heart thumping, each loud beat a reminder that his soulmate, his Derek, is here, finally. \u201cYou\u2019ll like Scott,\u201d he calls to him, too excited not to speak. \u201cHe\u2019s a veterinarian. Got the bite about ten years ago, when he turned eighteen. His soulmate, Kira, is a kitsune.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met a kitsune.\u201d\n\u201cNeither have I.\u201d\u00a0\nStiles looks up from stirring the slowly heating milk to see Derek\u2019s brows furrow in confusion. \u201cYou haven\u2019t met your best friend\u2019s soulmate?\u201d\n\u201cIn my defense,\u201d Stiles smiles, \u201cneither has Scott. He and Kira are going to meet in about six months.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right,\u201d Derek shakes his head, looking over the mess of books and drawings on his coffee table. \u201cDo you know who all of your friends\u2019 and family member\u2019s soulmates are?\u201d\u00a0\nStiles shrugs. \u201cMostly. Everyone but Lydia, actually. Well, kinda. She doesn\u2019t want to know. She\u2019s a banshee, and she says she has enough foresight in her life, she\u2019d like to be surprised by something.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I read her once, though, not on purpose, of course. It was a long time ago, I was still learning to control when I have the visions. We were prepping a spell and my magic was going, and I accidentally brushed her hand. I didn\u2019t get her name, or when they\u2019ll meet, but I saw her. A human woman with dark hair and a pretty smile. I didn\u2019t tell Lydia, of course. Didn\u2019t even tell her I had a vision.\u201d\n\u201cThat was good of you. Do you need help with anything?\u201d\n\u201cNah, I got it,\u201d Stiles smiles, melting the chocolate. \u201cJust relax.\u201d\nDerek grunts a small noise that Stiles can\u2019t interpret, but resumes looking over Stiles\u2019 artwork on the table. \u201cWhat is this,\u201d he asks, fingering the edges of a half-inked drawing. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s my pet project,\u201d Stiles blushes, joining Derek on the couch with two oversized mugs. \u201cThe soulmate stuff pays the bills but this what I really want to do. It\u2019s a charmed graphic novel. Check it out.\u201d He takes Derek\u2019s mug from his hands, eyes flitting up to meet his when their fingers brush together around the ceramic, making Stiles\u2019 skin tingle. \u201cSee the hero, on the Pegasus,\u201d he says, pointing at his drawing of a young, dark-haired woman, \u201chacking through the ivy around the castle with her enchanted sword? That\u2019s Haven, she\u2019s a fallen angel leading a revolution \u2013\u201d Stiles stops abruptly at the look of shock that darts across Derek\u2019s face, his eyes going wide and his shoulders tensing. \u201cDude, you okay? You look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost?\u201d\n\u201cHaven,\u201d Derek whispers. \u201cHaven was my sister\u2019s name. One of them, my youngest. Cora was a couple of years older than her. They both died in the fire.\" Derek swallows hard. \"Haven isn\u2019t a common name. Where did you come up with it?\u201d\nNow Stiles is the one looking and feeling like he\u2019s seen a ghost. \u201cUm, well, it was supposed to be my name. And, um, actually it\u2019s my middle name too. My parents had a deal. If I was a boy my mom would name me, and a girl, my dad would. He chose the name Haven. He died before I was born, so my mom named me Szczesny after her dad like she was planning but kept Haven as my middle name for him.\u201d Stiles swallows too, eyes going a little hot. \u201cThey were soulmates,\u201d he shrugs.\nDerek reaches for his hand, tentative, but his fingers are solid and reassuring around his. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard all about this,\u201d Stiles goes on, blinking back his tears and twining his fingers with Derek\u2019s. \u201cLittle things about soulmates that would seem like coincidences otherwise. All part of the universe\u2019s plan to connect people, bring pairs together.\u201d\n\u201cTell me more about Haven the hero. She has an enchanted sword?\u201d\u00a0Derek smiles, and Stiles goes a little dizzy.\nHeart fluttering, Stiles looks back to the page in Derek\u2019s other hand. \u201cSee the tip of the sword, how it\u2019s kinda glowing a bit?\u201d\nDerek leans in closer to examine the drawing. \u201cI thought it was glittering ink.\u201d Derek scrunches up his nose as he inspects the drawing further, and he looks absolutely delectable. \u201cBut it\u2019s magic?\u201d\nStiles grins, pleased. \u201cYeah. The idea is to hide little charms, simple little spells, throughout the comic, at key points in the story. Only supernatural creatures can activate the magic, so it\u2019ll have a limited audience, but, whatever. Just press your finger over the tip of the sword.\u201d Derek does, an adorable noise of delighted surprise escaping from his mouth when the burst of glittering, colored light shoots up from the page like a firework, painting a brief, shimmering outline of a castle and flying leaves of ivy, like something out of Fantasia. \u201cPretty cool, huh?\u201d\n\u201cStiles, this is amazing. You\u2019re so talented.\u201d\nHe shrugs again, but he\u2019s grinning ear-to-ear with pride that Derek likes his art. \u201cIt\u2019s really just a popup book. But you know, cooler.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to read it. I\u2019ll buy a dozen copies.\u201d\nDerek is utterly sincere, and Stiles positively melts. He grips his hand harder and nudges his thigh with his knee. \u201cYou\u2019re just sayin\u2019 that \u2018cause you\u2019re my soulmate.\u201d\nHis soulmate \u2013 his freakin\u2019 soulmate \u2013 rolls his eyes and nudges him back, pressing their thighs together. He\u2019s kinda dying to kiss him again, but he doesn\u2019t want to spook Derek away by moving too fast or pressuring him into something too quickly. \u201cWhat do you do,\u201d Stiles asks him instead.\n\u201cI\u2019m a writer and a photographer. Mostly freelance.\u201d Derek stiffens suddenly, nostrils flaring and shoulders shifting towards the door. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming up the stairs,\u201d he announces, and Stiles has to resist the urge to pet him on the head and say good boy like he does to Scott.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably my mom and her girlfriend Melissa,\u201d Stiles says, releasing Derek\u2019s hand and standing. \u201cShe\u2019s Scott\u2019s mom, by the way. They said they might swing by after the farmer\u2019s market. We usually meet there for breakfast on Sundays,\u201d he explains, feeling suddenly awkward at the imminent prospect of Derek meeting his mom. There goes not rushing things.\nDerek stands too, shoulders broad and steady, straightening his shirt. \u201cIs this \u2013 am I okay?\u201d\nStiles squeezes his shoulder before going to open the door. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d\nHe opens his door just as his mom is about to knock and is greeted with a warm, rain-and-sage-scented hug, Melissa following close behind her carrying a canvas bag overflowing with fresh fruits and vegetables. His mother, charmed bracelets tinkling, sweeps into the small apartment, skirts flowing. \u201cGood morning, sweetie, how was your appointment? Everyone at the market missed you. Athena sent two of her enchanted cupcakes for you, and she said you should call her son \u2013 \u201d She catches sight of Derek and stops short. \u201cSpeaking of enchanted cupcakes,\u201d she grins, raising her eyebrows knowingly at Stiles after take a good, long look at him.\n\u201cMom,\u201d Stiles groans, blushing.\n\u201cWhat,\u201d she says, mock innocent. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t want to eat him up.\u201d\n\u201cOh my gods, mother,\u201d Stiles cringes, refusing to look at Derek, knowing his cheeks are splotchy and red, horrified.\n\u201cStiles, who\u2019s your friend?\u201d Melissa laughs, tickling his mom\u2019s side.\n\u201cUm, Derek, this my mom, Claudia, and, this is Melissa. This is Derek Hale, my \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cYour soulmate,\u201d his mom finishes, the rune tattoos on her forearms shimmering. \u201cI can see that you\u2019ve bonded,\u201d she winks, slipping free from Melissa\u2019s arms and walking up to Derek. \u201cA werewolf, of course. Perfect match for Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cHello Claudia, it\u2019s very nice to meet you,\u201d Derek says formally, offering her a handshake.\n\u201cDerek, hello,\u201d she smiles, her aura growing brighter with happiness as she pulls him into a hug. Stiles stands next to Melissa and watches Derek freeze in surprise for a moment before relaxing into her embrace, tension leaving his body, his aura growing clearer. Stiles feels it too, a little tug behind his heart that makes him shiver, his soulbond with Derek reacting to the aura-cleansing effects of his mother\u2019s embrace.\nEventually she pulls back from him, hands steady on his shoulders as he sways a little bit, looking at her with wide, grateful eyes. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d\u00a0\nShe squeezes Derek\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSoul work runs in the family. I cleanse. Your bond with Stiles made you very receptive to it. Your burdens should feel a little lighter now,\u201d she smiles and gently, lovingly pats his cheek. \u201cWelcome to the family, Derek.\u201d\nDerek looks over to Stiles, big eyes shining, but he\u2019s smiling, brilliantly, and that\u2019s the moment Stiles realizes he\u2019s already in love with his soulmate.\n\n~*~\n\nMelissa and his mom make themselves scarce quickly, both of them grinning beatifically as they leave, his mom cooing \u201chave fun, boys\u201d while winking at Derek, whose beard couldn\u2019t completely hide his blush. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nWhen they\u2019re alone again, their earlier hesitation and tentativeness dissipates mostly, and Stiles isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s their ever-growing bond, his mother\u2019s brief cleanse of Derek\u2019s soul, or her teasing, but now it\u2019s suddenly quite comfortable and easy between them. They spend the rest of the day lounging around, talking, getting to know each other, sharing childhood stories and favorite books and pet peeves. Derek tells Stiles about Laura, and about his photography and his writing, which Stiles immediately finds online, heart thumping harder and harder as Derek flusters and squirms under his utterly sincere and adoring praise. He tells Derek more about Scott and Lydia and about growing up in his mother\u2019s Spellwork shop and learning magic and supernatural lore.\nAs they talk, facing each other on the couch, they ease into casual touches again, cautious at first, then more sure and deliberate, each one lighting Stiles up, making the pooling glow of warmth in his chest burn hotter, his skin lighting up at the contact as well at Derek\u2019s shy little smiles.\n\u00a0\nAt dusk, Stiles, stretched out on the couch, his barefeet resting on Derek\u2019s lap, gets an idea. \u201cCome on,\u201d he says, standing up, searching for their shoes. \u201cI want to show you something.\u201d Stiles finds a canvas bag and gathers the blackberry pie his mom brought him from the farmer\u2019s market, along with a bundle of rare herbs from his personal stock, and the latest three issues of the new Thor comic. \u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he answers to Derek\u2019s raised eyebrows, winking.\nIn the fading daylight, he drives them along the winding mountain road into the old-growth forest, unable to stop himself from looking over at the passenger side of his Jeep pretty much constantly, marveling at the sight of Derek watching him drive, looking like he belongs there. Stiles pulls onto a secluded dirt road just barely wide enough for a vehicle, and drives them even farther into the depths of the forest and higher up the coast range, miles from town now, Derek\u2019s eyebrows rising more the longer they drive, but he doesn\u2019t ask where they\u2019re going.\nStiles turns off the Jeep when they the road deadends into a giant, gnarled blackberry thicket, and grabs the bag and hops out. \u201cIt\u2019s just a short walk from here,\u201d he explains, leading Derek to a barely visible path that leads into the oldest part of the forest. He doesn\u2019t let go of his hand when they start walking, and Derek twines their fingers together, trusting Stiles to lead him down the dark trail that he knows from memory.\n\u201cCan you guess where we\u2019re going?\u201d\u00a0\nDerek scents the air, chin jutting up, eyes searching, brows up in confusion. \u201cI just smell the forest.\u201d\nStiles grins. \u201cWe\u2019re just a couple yards from a hot springs.\u201d\n\u201cNo way, I can smell a hot spring from a mile away.\u201d\n\u201cNot one in a glamoured faerie circle,\u201d Stiles chirps, pulling him of the path and through some brambles until they\u2019re standing in front of a large, nondescript boulder that butts up against a high, steep bluff. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he says, sensing Derek\u2019s hesitation. \u201cMy family has been allied with the faerie clan that lives in this forest for generations now. We won\u2019t be bothered. And,\u201d he adds, hooking the bag on his wrist to search his pockets, \u201cthis offering of gifts will further endear us to them. Siobhan, their queen, loves sweets and superheroes.\u201d The search of his pockets comes up empty. \u201cUm, can I get claw?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI need my blood, to activate the rune to open an entrance through the glamour. My pocketknife must have fallen out.\u201d\u00a0\nEven in the dim light, Stiles can see that Derek still looks skeptical, but he still raises a hand between them, pointing one finger up and letting a single, lethal claw slip free, exhibiting perfect control. Stiles holds out his own finger, but Derek doesn\u2019t move. \u201cAre you sure,\u201d he asks, brow furrowing in concern.\n\u201cDude, it\u2019s just a tiny poke. I only need a couple of drops. It\u2019ll hardly hurt. Plus, I heal fast, like you. Well, not nearly as fast as you, but you know. Come on, just poke me.\u201d Derek just stares at him, mouth open, and yeah, okay, Stiles probably could have worded that differently. \u201cUm, here, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he mutters, wrapping his hand around Derek\u2019s finger. He runs his fingertip across the top of his hard, smooth curve of the long claw before ever-so-gently pressing against the vicious tip, a shiver of knife-edged pleasure running down his spine. It\u2019s possible he makes a noise, strangled and curious, thinking about what it would feel like if Derek dragged all of his claws across his skin like that, tantalizingly and slow. Derek would be gentle, he thinks, pressing the tip of his finger harder against the point of his claw, biting his lip at the sting of pain he barely feels.\nWith Derek watching closely, Stiles turns towards the boulder, squeezing his fingertip until a fat drop of blood appears. He calls up his spark and locates the glamoured rune carved into the rock, knows from memory exactly where to press his blood-stained finger. Bloodmagic sizzles through him, illuminating the rune and then the air around them shimmers and bends, blossoms with a wild abundance of scents: the earthy but somehow fizzy musk of faerie magic, Stiles\u2019 own sugar-tinged power, the faint sulfur of the hot springs.\nStiles watches the wonder in Derek\u2019s eyes as the glamour partially lifts, revealing a space between the boulder and the bluff just tall and wide enough for them to walk through. Stiles goes in first, leading Derek through the entrance that just seconds ago looked like a bulge in the giant rock, turning back so he can see the look on Derek\u2019s face when he enters the circle. Stiles has been coming here since he was a kid, and the beauty of the enchanted place still leaves him breathless; he can\u2019t wait to see Derek\u2019s expressive face see it for the first time.\nDerek may be his soulmate, but Stiles would challenge anyone not think the look of marvelous awe in those eyes rivals the beauty of the faerie circle, expansive and awed, glittering green and gold just like the charmed forest haloing the small, steaming pool of crystal-clear water. Derek's eyes wander up to the old-growth trees forming a thick canopy over the springs, giving the circle an enclosed, sheltered feeling, dozens of floating, glowing orbs of soft light sprinkled through the air all around them, utterly and truly magical.\nHe leads him to the edge of small, underwater spring-fed pool, a near-perfect circle roughly eight feet in diameter, steam curling from the shining surface in evanescent tendrils. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural hot spring,\u201d Stiles explains, toeing off his shoes. \u201cEnhanced with some faerie magic of course. The water's perfect. You up for a little skinny dipping with your soulmate?\u201d He winks, but he\u2019s sure it doesn\u2019t belie his nerves.\nDerek\u2019s smile is bright enough to outshine the spheres of enchanted light hovering above them. That\u2019s enough of an answer for Stiles, who begins to strip quickly, Derek doing the same. They toss their clothes in a pile towards the trees, stealing excited, bashful glances at each other when they\u2019re both standing naked at the water\u2019s edge. Stiles is only momentarily embarrassed that he\u2019s more than a little hard, because Derek is too, and he goes a little breathless and dizzy, his not-so-surreptitious look turning into an open-mouthed gape when he sees Derek\u2019s cock, big and eager, mouthwatering. Derek seems to be having a similar reaction to seeing him, and Stiles flushes with pride and affection as they lower themselves in, marveling at the miracle of Derek wanting him.\nThe pool isn\u2019t very deep, only about waist-high in the middle, with natural rock outcroppings on the sides that serve as perfect natural seats. They both stand in the center and drop to their knees, letting the steaming hot water, slightly oily with glistening magic residue, envelope them like a soft, sacred blanket. \u201cThe faeries say that the lights,\u201d Stiles whispers, reaching up to gently tap at one of the small gleaming orbs, \u201care little bits of souls that get left behind on this plane when they die. Faerie offerings to their progeny, lighting their way.\u201d He looks up, watching the lights drift above them, a couple of bright stars and a sliver of the moon peeking through the trees. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the most beautiful thing you\u2019ve ever seen?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek says, immediate and sincere, and Stiles glances down to see that he\u2019s not looking up at all, but at Stiles, enraptured and reverent.\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d he mumbles, heart thumping, swallowing when Derek moves closer, his big hand coming up to cradle his jaw.\n\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d Derek asks, barely a whisper.\nStiles wants to tell him that he never has to ask, but all he can muster is a nod and that\u2019s enough for Derek. This kiss is as extraordinary as the first, even though they\u2019re already soulbonded: the real magic is us, Stiles realizes, smiling as he licks into Derek\u2019s soft, warm mouth, arms wrapping around each other, bodies pressed close under water.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek pants, when they finally pull their mouths away from each other, Stiles\u2019 lips already feeling swollen with beard burn that he wants to feel everywhere. Derek\u2019s asking for something, but he seems to be struggling to find the words.\nStiles holds him tighter and ducks down to kiss his neck, pressing his mouth to the hot thrum of his pulse, the soulbond surging between them, and Stiles knows what he needs. \u201cDerek,\u201d he whispers, pulling back to look at him. \u201cCan I\u2026can I touch you? I just want\u2026I just want to make you feel good,\u201d he urges, his voice husky with need, his cock, his entire body, throbbing with desire to explore and worship every inch of his soulmate\u2019s exquisite body.\u00a0\nDerek nods, eyes falling closed and sighing. Smiling, Stiles stands and pulls Derek up with him, the water lapping at their stomachs, still pressed close, cocks rubbing together too, making Stiles weak in the knees with bursts of hot pleasure. He runs his hands down Derek\u2019s back, from his nape to the base of his spine, his magic coming alive under his own skin as Derek\u2019s shivers and rises under his touch. \u00a0He kisses him again, slowly, hands running up and down his broad, muscled back with slick cascades of water, eventually venturing down to slowly, tentatively cup his magnificent ass, and fuck, if he hadn\u2019t already known that Derek was made for him, the way it fits full and firm in his palms would have convinced him. His fingers are long enough to just barely dip into his lightly-furred cleft, and Stiles teases in, letting his hands move with more purpose, waiting for Derek's reaction.\nDerek mouths at the soft spot behind his ear, whining softly, arms around Stiles\u2019 waist, holding on tight. Emboldened, Stiles delves deeper, lightly pressing a finger against his hole, and Derek\u2019s cock twitches hard against his belly and he practically purrs. \u201cYou like that, big guy,\u201d Stiles mewls.\nDerek answers him with a playful nip to his earlobe, and he lets Stiles walk him backwards until Derek\u2019s pressed against the edge of the pool, tugging on his hips. He gets the message loud and clear and pushes himself up to sit on the edge of the pool, leaning back on his hands, legs spread wide while Stiles slots himself between his thighs on his knees on a rock outcropping. For a long time he just stares him, eyes greedily drinking up every elegant line and muscled curve of his chiseled abs and pecs, his sculpted shoulders and rippling biceps, the way his long dark lashes fall so graceful and sweet against his cheeks, the slight downturn of his wide, plump mouth.\nMoving slowly, Stiles makes, deliberate, delicate work of caressing, kissing, and licking all of him that he can, starting at his collarbones and working his way down, teasing his nipples until they\u2019re hard and shiny, delighting in the feel of Derek\u2019s coarse chest hair rough-but-still-soft on his tongue and the salty-sweet taste of his skin. Derek is all quiet, shuddering twitches at first, like he\u2019s trying to control himself, but once Stiles pauses his ministrations and leans up to kiss him again and tells him how badly he wants to hear him, wants to feel him give in, Derek relaxes, giving himself over to Stiles\u2019 careful, adoring hands, laying back onto the soft, warm earth.\nStiles continues to navigate the blissfully erotic terrain of Derek\u2019s powerful body, all that wild, coiled strength buzzing hot under his skin, humming in harmony with Stiles\u2019 own aura and his magic. He moves farther back into the water to kiss and nibble at the inside of Derek\u2019s thighs, hand sliding down below his balls, seeking his rim, breaching him with a wet finger while taking his cock into his other hand and teasing his slit with his tongue, eyes rolling back at the delicious taste of him.\nDerek makes the most incredible noise, a mewling rumble from deep in his throat that speaks to years of unfulfilled need. Stiles is desperate to make it good for him, to give him what he hasn\u2019t been able to or let himself have for so long. He takes his time, licking and kissing up and down his thickly-veined shaft, laves over the head of his cock, pulling gently on his foreskin, looking up to meet Derek\u2019s flickering blue eyes, and feels his own eyes shimmer in response, gaze locked on each other as Stiles finally swallows him all the way down. He pushes his finger deeper too, Derek\u2019s body relaxed and pliant under his touch.\nHe works his cock with his mouth and tongue and slides a second finger into him, his own cock throbbing at the thought of someday soon fucking into that lush, velvet heat. Derek is gasping and grunting, hands running through Stiles\u2019 hair, and he's close, Stiles can tell, so he pulls of his cock and licks down to suckle at his heavy balls, pulling his fingers out too. Derek cries out at the loss like Stiles has betrayed him, but then curses and whines gratefully when Stiles spreads his thighs wider to better get at his slightly stretched, unfurling pink hole.\n\u201cFuck, Stiles,\u201d he whines, grateful and desperate, when he circles his rim a few times before pushing in, plunging in as far as he can, Derek\u2019s hips rocking down, ass clenching around his tongue. Stiles tries to go slow, tries to drag it out even more, but Derek is quivering and panting hard and fuck, he tastes good. Giving in, Stiles licks harder and faster, devouring, slipping his fingers back in and curling them up, still sucking at his rim.\nWithout warning, Stiles\u2019 spark ignites, buzzing of its own volition, simmering from his heart straight to the tips of his fingers, sending small jolts of magic into Derek\u2019s prostate. Derek howls, back bowing and hips thrusting, cock gushing onto his abs, clawed hands grappling at the ground. Stiles leans back to watch in wide-eyed awe, his magic reverberating through Derek's body and back into his, an ecstatic vibration that surprises him as much as it does Derek, who continues to writhe as he comes and comes, the magic drawing out his orgasm to impossibly beautiful lengths.\nStiles\u2019 magic has never come alive like that before, has never acted of its own accord to fulfill his will. It\u2019s the soulbond, he knows, grinning, drunk with arousal at the sight of the utterly contented, blissed out werewolf splayed out before him, his damp skin shining with the faerie light, ridged plane of his abs glistening with thick come. His mouth still rich with the taste of Derek's\u00a0perfect ass, Stiles swipes a sticky puddle of it from his belly button, purring at the bittersweet flavor. Derek, claws retracted now, hauls him up by the armpits into a sloppy kiss, licking into Stiles\u2019 mouth and reaching down to get a hand around his leaking cock. It only takes a few firm strokes, and then Stiles is biting Derek\u2019s jaw, groaning, spilling thickly between them, pleasure curling and throbbing through his body, skin alight, Derek stroking him through it until they both collapse at the water\u2019s edge in a tangled, exhausted heap, sated, elated, soulbonded.\n\n\u00a0~*~\n\nIt\u2019s well past midnight when they wake from their post-orgasm forest nap and get dressed, leaving the bag of offerings for the fae and meandering slowly back to the Jeep hand-in-hand. Back at Stiles' place, they shower in his tiny bathroom, barely enough space for the two of them to fit in the narrow stall together, which makes showering much more difficult, but lazily rutting against each other until they both come again very, very easy.\nNaked, they crawl into bed, moving together like they\u2019ve been sleeping side-by-side for years. Stiles stretches out on his back, and Derek curls around him, resting his head on his chest, sighing sweetly and nuzzling his beard into his skin until Stiles shivers. Derek holds on to him tightly, and Stiles rests one hand, protective, on his rippling back, and with the other, gentles his fingers through his soft, silky hair. Derek falls asleep in moments, utterly trusting, and Stiles\u2019 eyes sting with tears, overwhelmed with the miracle of the gift he\u2019s been given.\u00a0\nJust before he drifts to sleep too, Stiles grins into the dark, reminding himself to record the morning\u2019s appointment in his seeking journal.\u00a0\n\nDerek H., beta werewolf. A soulseeker named Stiles.\u00a0\n"
