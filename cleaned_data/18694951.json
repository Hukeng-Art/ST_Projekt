    "text": "Wolves and foxes don\u2019t get along.\nHere are the things Stiles remembers most about his mother:\nHe remembers that she taught him to control his werefox shift when he was just a kit, and that they spent their afternoons as foxes, chasing each other through the house, in her closet, where the hems of her summer dresses were the perfect hiding places for a baby fox.\nHe remembers her bedtime stories of all the horrific things a werewolf would do if it caught a fox trespassing on its territory. How they would hurt him, and go after his family.\nHe remembers she let him shift outside only once, when he was six, and they\u2019d gone on a family vacation far from home, so that if any wolves caught their scent, they\u2019d be long gone before they were found.\nHe remembers his dad coming home from work and finding them curled up as foxes on the sofa, and throwing up his hands and laughing and asking where his family went, and laughing harder when Stiles used his little claws to scale his deputy uniform and perch on his shoulder.\nHe remembers his mom getting sick, her human body wasting away slowly until she was too weak to shift, and how he\u2019d curl up on her lap as a fox and she\u2019d stroke his fur as chemo drugs dripped into his system.\nHe remembers that he spent two entire weeks as a fox after she died, curled up in her closet with sweet summer dresses drifting over his head, until her scent started to fade away.\nWhen he came out as a boy, his dad grabbed him tight and cried into his hair and Stiles decided that he would never, ever, ever shift again.\nThere was no point when his mother wasn\u2019t there to play with, and his dad needed him as a boy, not a fox.\nAnd then, seven years later, they moved to Beacon Hills and, as soon as they crossed the boundary line, Stiles just knew. There were wolves here, and if they found him, they\u2019d tear him apart.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter, though. Stiles barely remembers how to be a fox at all, and hasn\u2019t since the doctor diagnosed his jittery, hyperactive energy from containing that side of him as ADHD.\nHe\u2019s barely a fox and if the scent of wolves that\u2019s so thick in Beacon Hills makes him a little more jittery, a little more aware of that part of himself that he\u2019s kept buried for so long, well. He resolves to ignore it and do his best to be a regular kid starting at a new school at the beginning of senior year.\nHe\u2019ll take this year as a win if he manages to make even one friend by graduation.\nThe first werewolf Stiles ever sees is a goofy looking dude with floppy brown hair and a crooked smile, leaning up against a black camaro outside the high school, wearing an oversized leather jacket, surrounded by half a dozen other preternaturally beautiful girls and guys, also in leather. Also probably werewolves. \nThey look like they stepped right out of Twilight and it\u2019s not subtle.\nHe always thought he\u2019d be afraid if he ever met a real werewolf, but Stiles has been in beacon Hills for two weeks by this point, and he\u2019s smelled them everywhere.\nWhich probably means they\u2019ve caught his scent, too, even though Stiles hasn\u2019t actually shifted since he was 11.\nBut these wolves -- with their red lipstick and perfect hair and leather and super hot sports car -- they don\u2019t look half as scary as his mother always warned him werewolves were. They look like they\u2019re trying just a little too hard.\nStiles tosses them a sarcastic salute on his way by and no one eats him, so. It\u2019s a win as far as first days of school go.\nThey don\u2019t seem to be the best at being werewolves, because though they look constipated and concerned whenever he\u2019s near them, they never seem to actually see him, and if being invisible is what it takes to stay alive until college, Stiles will take it.\nIt\u2019s hard, though. The longer he\u2019s there, the harder it is not to give into the part of him that seems to believe that if they can go around willynilly being wolves, then he should be able to be a fox, and Beacon Hills is surrounded by miles and miles of forest -- Stiles starts to dream that he\u2019s running through the trees on four little paws and as the days turn to weeks and months, it becomes nearly impossible to focus on anything but that.\nHe doesn\u2019t make friends, but he\u2019s not surprised. Stiles is an acquired taste and no one here has any interest in acquiring him, especially as he gets more tightly wound, fox energy practically vibrating to find its way free.\nHe gets a lot of detentions. His grades aren\u2019t the greatest. His dad gets called in for more than one meeting with the principal, and then sits him down for a few Concerned Conversations, but Stiles is trying his best. He\u2019s just\u2026 holding on as best he can until he gets out of here.\nIt\u2019s his dad\u2019s idea to take up running -- Stiles is half convinced that his dad thinks if Stiles starts running, maybe he\u2019ll start shifting, because, though not a shifter himself, his dad has some idea that it cannot be healthy. He\u2019d given up trying to talk to Stiles about that when Stiles was 14 and angry at the world and now it\u2019s just. Something They Don\u2019t Talk About.\nRunning as a human is painful and awkward and stupid, but it\u2019s good for burning off his hyperactive energy, so he does it.\nAt first, he sticks to the sidewalks and side streets in town. There\u2019s no use pushing his luck, and he knows he\u2019s lucky that he\u2019s managed half a school year of being a werefox surrounded by wolves without getting discovered. He\u2019s managed to suppress any foxy urges, however.\nThe Preserve is too much to resist, however. For all that he\u2019s pretending his foxy instincts aren\u2019t there, Stiles is, at heart, a fox. And a fox needs to run, to explore.\nSo one early spring morning, Stiles gives into the urge and takes an abrupt left off a sidewalk, cuts through someone\u2019s backyard, and then he\u2019s in the woods.\nHe jogs for a little while, slow and steady, keeping his heart rate calm, pretending he\u2019s just gonna jog like any other day before returning home.\nSoon enough, however, he\u2019s so deep in the woods that he cannot smell the houses, the cars, the pavement. All he can hear is the wind in the trees and the distant sounds of birds.\nHe\u2019s completely alone.\nSo no one would know if he shifted. Just for a few minutes. Just a chance to stretch his muscles.\nIt\u2019ll help him contain his hyperactive energies. It\u2019ll help him focus. Hell, maybe it\u2019ll calm him down enough that he can be a normal kid long enough to make a goddamn friend.\nHe\u2019s so far from town and from the werewolves and they haven\u2019t caught him yet -- they\u2019re obviously terrible at being werewolves. So if he shifts out here, for just a little while, to take the edge off, they won\u2019t know.\nAnd he\u2019ll be able to sleep again. And focus in school. And his dad\u2019ll stop worrying so much about him.\nAnd he misses his mom so much -- maybe it\u2019ll help him feel closer to her again.\nHe strips, tossing his clothes to the ground at the base of a tree trunk, and then, rubbing at his arms and looking around nervously, he takes a moment to second guess his intentions.\nAnd then he decides, fuck it.\nHis body remembers how to be a fox better than he thinks it should, seeing as he hasn\u2019t shifted in so long. One moment he\u2019s human, the next he\u2019s not.\nStiles takes a moment, just adjusting to his new centre of gravity, his new height, his sharper senses.\nAnd then he runs.\nHe darts through the underbrush, leaps over fallen logs, rolls through soft soil and dead things. He hops over stones spanning the river, scrambles up muddy embankments, hunts strange scents through rocky outcroppings, down hills, through thickets of raspberry bushes and ivy.\nHe runs until his little heart is pounding and his lungs are aching and he\u2019s still vibrating with the adrenaline of being free, of worrying about nothing more than where his little paws are taking him and what he gets to smell along the way.\nAt dusk, he finally starts to think about going home. \nHis dad will be getting off work soon, Stiles likes to have a healthy dinner waiting for him, and he\u2019s still got homework to do before school.\nHe turns back and starts picking his way through the forest towards home.\nAnd then he puts his front paw down on what looks like a flattened stone, and something clicks.\nStiles has half a second to freeze and then the bear trap jerks up and out of the fallen leaves, sharp teeth snapping shut around his shoulder.\nHe feels his bones crack and shatter, his skin tear, and all he is aware of is the sharp, blinding pain and the scent of his blood.\nHis screams as he thrashes and tries to pull himself free send the nearby birds fleeing, and all he manages to do is tear himself up even more.\nIt hurts. It hurts more than anything has ever hurt before. He can feel shards of his bones tearing his flesh from the inside, can feel his body trying to heal around the sharp teeth of the trap, can feel it tearing open again when he moves.\n\u00a0\nHe finally gives up and falls to the ground, panting so raggedly, his muzzle is wet with bloody foam.\nHe whines and he licks at the wounds on his leg and his shoulder and he thinks about animals chewing their own legs off to escape a trap like these.\nHe wonders if he has the strength to do that.\nHe knows he doesn\u2019t.\nDarkness falls.\n*\nStiles loses consciousness, and when he wakes again, it\u2019s with a start. The forest is lit up by the full moon above, he\u2019s still trapped, and in the trees, he can see a pair of shining golden eyes.\nOf course he\u2019d be stupid enough to go for a run in the woods on the full moon.\nStiles doesn\u2019t know what werewolves do to werefoxes, his mother had never gone into too much detail, but it won\u2019t be good. Stiles knows that much.\nHe drags himself to his feet, the chain pinning the trap to the ground rattling as he does, and he backs away, whining soft and low. He tries to pull himself free and the pain makes everything spin, going gray around the edges.\nThe wolf comes closer, growling low, and Stiles makes one last, desperate attempt to pull himself free. \nAll he does is tear his shoulder open and the scent of fresh blood makes him want to puke. He collapses, a pathetic lump of fox red fur, trembling and panting and waiting to die.\nHis dad\u2019s never going to know what happened to him.\nThe wolf bares its teeth in a fierce snarl, sniffing at him, and Stiles lashes out with his other paw weakly.\nThe wolf doesn\u2019t react much -- just blinks down at him -- and then it sits back on its haunches, lifts its muzzle, and howls.\nGreat. Great. Calling for reinforcements. \nJust what Stiles needs.\nThe world drips out of focus again.\n*\nStiles comes to screaming, and for a few moments, nothing exists except pain and blood and fear.\nHe lashes out wildly, pure feral terror, and he\u2019s pinned to the ground easily. He\u2019s not in the trap anymore, but he\u2019s still torn apart and bleeding.\nHe can\u2019t breathe, he can\u2019t think, all he knows is that there are teeth at his throat and a subvocal growl is vibrating in his bones and it isn\u2019t his.\nGoing very still, Stiles tries to catch his breath and remember where he is and why.\nThe teeth gradually relax and even when the wolf pinning him backs away, Stiles holds still, closes his eyes, and pants.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the fox we\u2019ve been hunting?\u201d someone sneers. \u201cPathetic.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are we going to do with him?\u201d someone else asks. Stiles opens his eyes enough to get a hazy image of half a dozen naked human-shapes and -- yeah, he totally called it his first day in Beacon Hills. \n\u201cLet him die, do us all a favour,\u201d someone else says. \u201cWhat? He didn\u2019t follow the rules, he invaded our territory, he knew what would happen.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a kid,\u201d someone says, quiet. Stiles pulls his lips back in a weak snarl because he knows these people -- they go to his fucking school. If he\u2019s a kid, so are they.\n\u201cBring him to the house.\u201d\nHe opens his eyes, blinking into the darkness, because he\u2019s never heard that voice at school, but before he can make out who the speaker was, most of them are shifting back to wolf form and taking off into the shadows with a chorus of howls, leaving one behind.\nLeaving Jackson Whittemore behind.\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Jackson growls, and then he\u2019s a wolf too, picking Stiles up by back of his neck and taking off after the others.\nIt hurts. It hurts so fucking much.\nStiles is grateful when he loses consciousness again.\n*\n\u201cHe\u2019s still a fox.\u201d\nStiles holds himself very still, swallowing down the urge to pant, to cry. Of course he\u2019s still a fox -- even now, his body burning up with fever and pain, his mom\u2019s warning about wolves holds true.\nIf they find out who he is, they might go after his dad.\n\u201cOf course he is,\u201d someone else says, a girl, voice sharp and cutting. He recognizes it, he thinks. \u201cHe\u2019s terrified -- can\u2019t you smell it?\u201d\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he healing?\u201d\n\u201cThe trap was laced with wolfsbane,\u201d says the sharp voice. \u201cEven foxes are affected. Deaton\u2019s sent some salve that should help, but his body is smaller -- the poison travels faster. We\u2019re doing our best.\u201d\n\u201cWolfsbane? But that means --\u201d\n\u201cHunters,\u201d she says, quiet. \u201cAllison\u2019s looking into it.\u201d\nA door slams. Stiles wonders if he\u2019s alone. He takes a deep, careful breath, which pulls at his shoulder, and just as he\u2019s about to convince himself that he\u2019s alone, someone reaches out and lays a careful hand on his side.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, little fox,\u201d she says, soft and melodic. \u201cI know you aren\u2019t sleeping.\u201d\nStiles opens his eyes and stares. He should have known Cora\u2019s voice -- they were in class together often enough, but she never really had much to say.\n\u201cThere you are.\u201d Her eyes are dark and narrow, studying him. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be afraid here.\u201d\nCora Hale is the Hale Alpha\u2019s younger sister. Stiles has every reason to be afraid.\nHe does his best to study the room he\u2019s in -- it looks like an ordinary guest room -- and notices the sun shining brightly out the window.\nIt\u2019s morning. Oh god, his dad is going to be losing his mind.\nStiles tries to get up, but it tears at his shoulder, and Cora hisses and holds him down. \u201cYou aren\u2019t healing,\u201d she says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t put any stitches in because we\u2019re hoping the antidote counteracts the poison and you start to heal, but if you move, you\u2019ll start to bleed, and you\u2019ve already lost a shit load of blood. Okay?\u201d\nHe holds still.\n\u201cJust rest,\u201d she says, taking her hand away carefully once she\u2019s sure he\u2019s not going to move. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re healed, we\u2019ll deal with everything else.\u201d\nEverything else like Stiles trespassing on pack land.\nStiles closes his eyes and pretends to sleep.\n*\nHe waits until she\u2019s gone and then drags himself off the bed they\u2019ve put him on, limping over to the window. He can smell the fresh blood, knows he\u2019s torn himself open, but it doesn\u2019t matter. He needs to get home.\nThe window is open and he drags himself up onto the window sill, shoving at the screen with his muzzle until it pops free. \nHe\u2019s on the second floor. But he\u2019s a werefox -- he\u2019ll heal -- won\u2019t he heal?\nHe takes a breath and jumps.\nAnd screams as his body breaks when he hits the ground.\n*\n\u201cI thought foxes were supposed to be smart.\u201d\n\u201cNot this one, apparently. Is Derek on his way? If the fox dies, we\u2019re in so much trouble.\u201d\nStiles can\u2019t move or see or feel, and his hearing is fading in and out with his consciousness. Not feeling, he\u2019s sure, is a blessing, because his body is too broken to work and that has to hurt.\nHe drifts, catching little snippets of conversation and letting them go, and then, quietly, someone says, \u201cI know who you are.\u201d\nStiles opens his eyes.\nHe\u2019s still in his fox form and his body is twisted, torn open, slick with his own blood, and for a moment, all Stiles can focus on is his vision, slowly fading into existence.\nThere\u2019s a guy beside his bed, dark hair and stubble and a killer jawline. His eyes are light and hazel and super fucking pretty.\nAnd then his body decides that he\u2019s conscious enough to feel pain, and everything shatters into a broken, sharp mess of pain and screaming.\nHe\u2019s not sure how long it lasts, but when it fades, he realizes that the guy -- Derek Hale, alpha fucking werewolf, of course Stiles knows him -- is stroking one hand along Stiles\u2019 flank, as if he doesn\u2019t even care that Stiles is sticky with blood.\nBlack lines are moving up Derek\u2019s forearm, disappearing into his skin as he takes Stiles\u2019 pain, and it\u2019s a dizzying, super sweet rush of adrenaline and relief as he does.\nStiles lets his eyes close and breathes shakily and Derek says, quiet, \u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid like that again, Stilinski. We are not going to let you die.\u201d\nStiles drifts away, still fumbling with the knowledge that for some reason, the alpha wolf has decided to let Stiles live.\nTo demand that he live.\nStiles doesn\u2019t know what to do with that.\n*\nStiles has dreams -- nightmares born of fever, a hazy impression of fear, of running through the woods in wolf form, chased by monsters who turn out to be his mother with blood in her teeth.\nWhen his fever finally breaks, his body is sweat-sticky and his muscles ache and he\u2019s human again.\nAnd very naked.\nHe lays very still as consciousness comes back slowly, water drops running down a window pane. He remembers who he is, first, and but where he is takes a while.\nThere\u2019s music playing -- something soft and classical, and he can distantly hear water running, pots and pans clanking. He can smell something cooking.\nHe\u2019s not at home, and even if he was, it couldn\u2019t be his dad cooking, because --\nHis dad.\nStiles remembers everything abruptly, sits up so quickly his head spins. He groans at the spike of pain, hand coming up to his forehead as he closes his eyes.\nHe\u2019s at the Hale house and he doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019s been gone, but his dad is going to be flipping out. He has to go, he has to escape somehow -- jumping out the window is out, but maybe if he shifts, he can get down the stairs and out the door before anybody realizes what\u2019s happened and --\n\u201cHere,\u201d someone says, appearing at the door. Stiles holds himself as still as he can, tensed up and ready to fight or to run. It\u2019s Derek, wearing a worn out henley and super tight jeans and bare feet that look a whole lot less threatening than the boots he usually wears, while out intimidating innocent foxes with his leather jacket and his toothy smile and his pack of werewolves. He\u2019s always looked unapproachable and scary hot and Stiles has always sort of admired that, objectively, in the way anyone might admire someone who\u2019d probably break their neck if they ever realized they were being admired.\nThe bare feet, though, suddenly make him seem a little more human than wolf, and Stiles doesn\u2019t know what to do with that.\nDerek\u2019s holding a plate and Stiles cocks his head and scents the air even though he has no intention of eating Derek\u2019s food.\nHis stomach grumbles because it\u2019s a goddamn traitor.\nDerek comes in, holding the plate of scrambled eggs and toast out, and Stiles takes it with an ungracious grimace.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he mumbles, glaring down at the plate even as he crams an entire piece of toast into his mouth.\nDerek leans a hip against the doorframe, crosses his arms over his chest, and says, wary, \u201cHow\u2019s the pain?\u201d\n\u201cHead hurts,\u201d Stiles says, mouth full. \u201cMuscles ache. I gotta go home.\u201d He shoots Derek a quick glare. \u201cUnless you\u2019re keeping me here.\u201d\nDerek holds up both hands, like he\u2019s surrendering, and says, \u201cYou\u2019ve been free to leave the entire time. Just unable to actually do it.\u201d He shrugs one shoulder. \u201cEspecially after you jumped out the fucking window.\u201d\nStiles looks at the window, chewing petulantly, and then says, \u201cI should\u2019ve been fine.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d have incapacitated yourself even if the poison from that trap hadn\u2019t hindered your healing,\u201d Derek tells him. \u201cYou lost a lot of blood. Deaton wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d pull through.\u201d\n\u201cOh god,\u201d Stiles groans. \u201cIf I died because of my own stupidity and you buried my body in the woods and my dad never found out what happened to me, it would be the worst.\u201d\nDerek looks like he\u2019s trying to hide his amusement. \u201cYeah. Well. Luckily, Deaton counteracted the poison, we were able to give you a transfusion to jumpstart your healing and your body rallied.\u201d\n\u201cHow long--\u201d\n\u201cA week.\u201d\n\u201cFuck.\u201d Stiles scrambles out of the bed but the dizziness is sudden and complete and he almost falls as soon as his feet hit the floor. Derek\u2019s there to steady him though, gently but firmly guiding him back onto the bed.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d Derek says, tucking him in and glaring whenever Stiles makes any movement that might suggest he\u2019s going to try again. \u201cYou need to rest.\u201d\n\u201cBut my dad --\u201d\n\u201cKnows where you are.\u201d Derek watches Stiles carefully, hovering, and it makes Stiles want to shove him away or say something sarcastic and cutting, but his entire body is tired, including his tongue. \u201cHe was here just a few hours ago.\u201d\nStiles stares. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have left,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if he had work, if he knew--\u201d\n\u201cThere was a break in the case, we figured out who set the trap,\u201d Derek says, sitting on the edge of the bed and resting one hand on Stiles\u2019 shin, on top of the blankets. \u201cHe wanted to be the one to arrest him and I promised to text him if you woke. Your fever had already broken, so we knew you\u2019d be okay.\u201d\nStiles fidgets with the hem of the blanket and takes a deep breath and asks, \u201cDid you text him?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s on his way.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nStiles feels small and young and stupid and he wants to cry. He\u2019s already caused his dad so many problems, and now this? Getting mixed up with the local werewolf population, after swearing he\u2019d keep himself safe, after promising his mom and his dad both that he\u2019d remember everything she told him?\nStiles closes his eyes to keep the tears from escaping and takes a deep breath. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just let me die?\u201d he asks.\nDerek doesn\u2019t reply, not until Stiles finally opens his eyes and looks at him. \u201cBecause we\u2019re not monsters,\u201d Derek says, firm. \u201cWe don\u2019t make a habit of killing when we can help it. Besides, you\u2019d done a good enough job trying to get yourself killed already.\u201d\n\u201cBut -- but I\u2019m a fox,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWolves and foxes don\u2019t get along.\u201d\nDerek shrugs, getting to his feet. \u201cMaybe not. Lucky for us both that we\u2019re human too.\u201d He takes Stiles\u2019 plate. \u201cDo you want to shower?\u201d He wrinkles his nose, and it\u2019s incongruously cute on his super hot face. \u201cYou stink, but I don\u2019t think your dad will notice.\u201d\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Stiles says, mortified and sniffing at himself cautiously. \u201cSure, yeah, I need a shower before my dad gets back.\u201d He throws the blankets aside.\nDerek carefully averts his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll get you some clothes, too.\u201d\nBecause Stiles is naked.\nSmelly and naked.\nFuck.\n*\nStiles goes home that night with his dad, who carefully keeps all the lectures to a minimum until they\u2019re safe at home, which Stiles appreciates.\nHe also appreciates that most of his dad\u2019s anger comes from the fact that it took over 24 hours for Derek to realize who Stiles was, and he only figured it out after the whole town became aware of the fact that the sheriff\u2019s son had gone running in the woods and hadn\u2019t come home.\nTwenty-four hours was a long time to be missing a child.\nEventually, though, his dad relaxes and hugs Stiles a whole lot while they both manfully pretend they\u2019re not blinking back tears, and the sheriff gives Stiles one entire day of rest before he returns to school.\nIt\u2019s surreal, to go from thinking he was going to die in the woods to walking back into school as if nothing happened.\nExcept everyone\u2019s staring.\nApparently going missing for a week only to turn up suffering from \u2018dehydration\u2019 and no other wounds was enough to make Stiles go from invisible, to social pariah.\nHe makes his way to his locker, fights with the sticky lock, and before he can pull the door open, Scott McCall -- co-captain of the Lacrosse team and very unsubtle werewolf -- hops out of the crowd and beams at him.\n\u201cStiles, hey, hi, I\u2019m Scott,\u201d he says brightly, before thrusting a pile of books and papers into Stiles\u2019 arms. \u201cI\u2019ve collected your homework for you and I even got Boyd to do a bunch of it. He\u2019s the smartest of us.\u201d\nStiles blinks at him, clutching the homework. \u201cUh, thanks,\u201d he says. \nScott just continues smiling at him, eyes bright, and Stiles isn\u2019t very good at social interaction, so he\u2019s not sure where to go from here. \u201cSorry about, uh. Nearly dying.\u201d\n\u201cDude, no, it\u2019s fine, but.\u201d He leans close, eyebrows going up pointedly. \u201cDid Derek tell you? About --\u201d he wiggles his eyebrows. \u201cThe thing?\u201d\nStiles wants to step back, to reestablish his personal space, but the locker\u2019s at his back and he\u2019s trapped. \u201cUh,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich thing?\u201d\n\u201cThe blood thing,\u201d Scott whispers earnestly.\n\u201cThe blood -- oh. Oh! The transfusion.\u201d\nTo be entirely honest, in all the confusion and angst of reuniting with his father, Stiles hadn\u2019t given much thought to the lengths to which the Hale pack had gone to in order to save his life. He wonders if maybe he ought to write a thank you card -- maybe send a fruit basket. How does one adequately thank a werewolf pack for saving his life?\n\u201cThe transfusion,\u201d Stiles echoes. \u201cRight. Yeah, he mentioned it.\u201d\nScott leans even closer -- their noses are nearly brushing. \u201cIt was my blood,\u201d he whispers. \u201cThat means we\u2019re, like. Brothers.\u201d\nDoes it? Stiles isn\u2019t so sure. But it definitely means he owes Scott something more than a fruit basket.\nAnd brothers might just mean regular friends, in werewolf-language, and fuck, could Stiles ever use a friend in this fucking school.\n\u201cYou saved my life,\u201d he says, trying to match Scott\u2019s level of earnestness. He fails, but from the way Scott finally backs off, if only enough to make sure Stiles can see his bright smile, he\u2019s not sure it matters. \u201cI just thought it was Derek\u2019s blood, I didn\u2019t even--\u201d\n\u201cDerek\u2019s an alpha,\u201d Scott says with an easy shrug. \u201cDeaton said his blood would do more harm than help, so.\u201d He bounces on his feet. \u201cDude, I was happy to do it.\u201d\nThen, before Stiles can prepare himself for the physical contact, Scott throws an arm around his shoulders and says, \u201cMe an\u2019 the others\u2019ve been looking all over for you, you know. All year. We knew there was someone -- something -- strange but you were so good at hiding, dude.\u201d\nHiding is easy when the entire school was prepared to pretend you were invisible, but Stiles doesn\u2019t say that, just shoves most of his books in his locker and fishes out the ones he needs. It\u2019s hard, with Scott\u2019s arm around his shoulders, but he finds he doesn\u2019t mind.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he says, closing the locker, snapping the lock. \u201cI guess anything is good at hiding when compared to you and your pack.\u201d\nScott looks appalled. \u201cWe\u2019re not that bad!\u201d\nStiles rolls his eyes and elbows him in the side and says, \u201cI spotted you the first day I got here,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re all wearing leather and skulking around like you smell something terrible. It was straight out of Twilight.\u201d\nScott mulls that over a bit as they begin making their way down the hall. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says gamely. \u201cIf this is Twilight, that makes you Bella. Right? Sheriff\u2019s kid?\u201d\nStile groans, because he\u2019s not Bella, for fuck\u2019s sake. He\u2019s, at most, the snarky side character who went on to win an Oscar.\nThey\u2019re at his Chemistry class, however, and Scott finally lets him go, after playfully slapping his open palm against Stiles\u2019 shoulder, dragging it down his arm.\nIt\u2019s only after Stiles finds his seat that he realizes that Scott McCall, werewolf, lacrosse co-captain, popular dude was scenting him.\nWhat the fuck.\nThe day gets weirder when Isaac Lahey, pretty, tall, super skinny, too many scarves, walks in to class, looks around, makes a face, and takes the seat behind him. Willingly. Despite the many empty seats.\nWhat the absolute fuck.\n*\nAt lunch, Scott is wait at Stiles\u2019 locker again, this time with Allison Argent, his gorgeous girlfriend who smiles at Stiles even though he stumbles to a surprised stop when he sees them.\n\u201cStiles!\u201d Scott says happily. \u201cThis is Allison. She\u2019s the one who got the stuff for the antidote that Deaton needed to keep you from dying.\u201d\n\u201cUh, hey,\u201d Stiles says, before fumbling with his goddamn sticky lock and finally opening his locker. He crams his books inside.\n\u201cHey, Stiles,\u201d she says, super sweet. \u201cYou\u2019re looking better.\u201d\n\u201cFeeling better,\u201d he says, grabbing his paper bag lunch. \u201cThanks. Should I, uhh. I don\u2019t know the etiquette on saying thank you to packs, should I, uhm. Send a note? A fruit basket? Flowers? Edible Arrangement?\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Scott says easily. \u201cYou\u2019re good. It\u2019s just what pack does.\u201d\nAllison elbows him in the gut and says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Stiles. It\u2019s taken me my whole life to understand werewolf etiquette and I promise you, Scott is the absolute worst at it. I\u2019m just glad they finally figured out who the strange were was.\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cThey were all driving me nuts.\u201d\nStiles squints at her leather jacket -- it\u2019s too big for her. It\u2019s probably Scott\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re not a wolf,\u201d he says, startled.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she laughs. \u201cHuman. Come have lunch with us.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not really a suggestion, but Stiles has taken to sneaking his lunch in the back study stall in the library when the librarian wasn\u2019t looking, so he\u2019ll take it. \nScott and his pack eat lunch out on the lacrosse field, camped out on the bleachers, and Scott waves both arms when they leave the school and step onto the quad.\nA few of them wave back. More of them roll their eyes. Jackson scowls and crosses his arms over his chest and looks belligerent.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Allison says quietly, nudging him. \u201cJust stick with me and Scott. They can be intimidating but I promise, they\u2019re a bunch of ill-mannered puppies.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true, Stiles realizes some time later, after watching them. He tries to keep to himself, but Scott\u2019s exuberant and touchy beside him. Liam is, if anything, worse. Jackson, Erica and Isaac are territorial, full of hormonal posturing. Kira and Malia sit back, quiet and watchful and curled around each other.\nStiles feels a creeping sort of anxiety sitting with them, waiting for the other shoe to drop, for someone to flash fangs and lash out or threaten him or explain just what the repercussions for being a werefox on wolf land are.\nNo one does.\n*\nDerek\u2019s pack keeps it up for the rest of the month, and it takes Stiles an embarrassingly long time to figure out that they\u2019re probably, like. Surveilling him. Keeping their friends close and their enemies closer.\nIt\u2019s pretty disappointing, once he figures it out, because they\u2019d lulled him into a false sense of security and he\u2019d almost convinced himself that maybe they just. Wanted to be friends.\nOf course they didn\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s Lydia who gives the game away.\nShe doesn\u2019t like him. She\u2019s made it pretty fucking clear that she doesn\u2019t like his jittery inability to stay still, she doesn\u2019t like how talkative he gets when he thinks he\u2019s got friends. She doesn\u2019t like how clumsy he is, how badly he fucks up when they hang out after school and help the wolves on the lacrosse team practice.\nAnd he gets it. Stiles is an acquired taste and Lydia is not all that likely to be acquired.\nNearly a month after he\u2019s started hanging out with them at school, and Scott after school, Lydia shoves her juicebox aside, wrinkles her nose, and flicks her hair over her shoulder. She huffs and says, \u201cI\u2019m having a birthday party tomorrow and you should probably come.\u201d\nStiles takes an obnoxious slurp of his pop and then realizes that she\u2019s looking at him.\nHe glances over his shoulder, like maybe there\u2019s someone there she could be inviting, but there isn\u2019t, and she just rolls her eyes when he points to himself, stunned.\n\u201cYes, Stiles,\u201d she says with a scowl. \u201cYou.\u201d\nSomeone kicks her under the table and she flashes a smile but her teeth are gritted. \u201cI mean, I would love it if you would come to my party.\u201d\nAllison slings an arm around her shoulders and smiles sweetly and says, \u201cYeah, Stiles, you should totally come!\u201d\nAnd then Stiles realizes that everyone -- everyone around the fucking table -- is smiling wide, fake grins at him and staring, like they\u2019re all holding their breath and waiting to see if he\u2019ll agree and -- and Stiles just. Gets it.\nBecause there is no way that Lydia Martin actually wants him at her birthday. Just like there\u2019s no way that Jackson wants him there, or Boyd, or Isaac, or Liam, or Erica. Scott might want him there. But Cora? Kira? Malia? No way.\nIt\u2019s all fake. It has to be. It\u2019s the only thing that makes sense.\n\u201cUhm, maybe,\u201d he hedges, and all of them look disappointed, share quick, sidelong glances. Cora\u2019s eyes narrow and she leans closer to his side, breathing deeply and frowning, like she\u2019s smelling him.\n\u201cD\u2019you have plans, Stilinski?\u201d she asks.\nWolves can tell when you\u2019re lying, Stiles knows they can, so he says, \u201cNot really, no. I just. Need to check with my dad.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a beat of awkward silence and Scott finally breaks it, sounding almost like he\u2019s whining when he says, \u201cWhy do you smell\u2026\u201d he looks at the other wolves helplessly. \u201cSad.\u201d\n\u201cJust. Thinking about my econ test next period, you know how it is,\u201d Stiles says brightly.\n\u201cLie,\u201d Cora says, soft.\nStiles starts packing his things up quickly, shoving them into his bag, and pretending they aren\u2019t all looking like he kicked their dogs. Heh.\n\u201cGotta go get some last minute studying in, I\u2019ll let you know about the party, see you later, bye!\u201d\nHe flees.\nHe\u2019s not ashamed.\nBut he is fucking sad.\n*\nStiles hides out in the library, skips econ (he doesn\u2019t have a test anyway), and then walks home. It\u2019s Friday, he doesn\u2019t care if he misses the rest of his classes, his dad is working the late shift, and Stiles just. Wants to take some time to wallow.\nHe microwaves some Bagel Bites, drags himself upstairs and throws himself backwards onto his bed, both arms coming up over his face.\nHe\u2019s so fucking stupid. Of course they don\u2019t want to be his friends. Of course they\u2019re just. Spying on him for Derek. Making sure he keeps his nose out of trouble. He was so stupid to think otherwise.\nHis phone chimes at 3:20, right when class lets out -- once, twice, three times with texts and then with two calls and then it goes silent.\nStiles tries to read for a while, tries to do some homework, to watch some Netflix, to jerk off. None of it helps break through the foggy sadness that comes from realizing your only friends are actually just secret werewolf agents keeping tabs on you.\nAnd then he falls asleep.\nHe wakes up some time later when his window is shoved open roughly from the outside and Derek Hale slides in.\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Stiles gasps, sitting up before he\u2019s fully awake, already fumbling for the baseball bat he keeps under the bed before his eyes are open. He grabs it, brandishes it like it\u2019ll actually make much of a difference, and stares.\nDerek\u2019s dressed in too tight jeans and a leather jacket, shoulders hunched up and hands shoved in his pockets. He\u2019s stubbly and scowling and lurking in the shadows and Stiles wonders for one hazy, sleepy moment if he\u2019s actually still dreaming. Maybe this is a dream, one that\u2019s about to get interesting, the universe paying him back for his failed efforts to jerk off earlier that evening.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Derek says finally, like Stiles isn\u2019t carefully crawling out of bed, baseball bat still held up and ready to swing for his stupidly attractive face.\n\u201cHey?\u201d Stiles asks, voice embarrassingly shrill. \u201cHey? That\u2019s all you\u2019ve got to say? You break into my room in the middle of the night and that\u2019s what you open with?\u201d\nDerek shrugs, scuffing his foot against the carpet, and says, \u201cI was just. Around. Thought I\u2019d check in.\u201d\n\u201cRight. Right. You were just around. Because I stopped answering your puppy\u2019s messages and you needed to make sure I wasn\u2019t out pissing on wolf-claimed trees or whatever.\u201d\nDerek stares at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou know! They weren\u2019t doing the spying shit for you so you had to do it yourself!\u201d\n\u201cThe\u2026 spying shit.\u201d\nStiles throws up both hands, nearly smashing his light out with the bat, and says, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid? I mean sure, it took a while, but I did figure it out. Of course -- of course they didn\u2019t actually want to be friends with me, they were watching me. For you. Because I\u2019m a fox and wolves don\u2019t get along with foxes! Like you think I\u2019m gonna -- gonna steal or chickens or whatever, but I\u2019m not! I didn\u2019t ask to come here, my dad got transferred here and I had to come too and it isn\u2019t my fault!\u201d\nDerek just stares at him, looking stony and uncomfortable, and then he says, \u201cNone of that makes sense, Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cThen what are you doing here!\u201d\n\u201cScott\u2019s upset.\u201d\nStiles blinks at him once, and then again, and his words still don\u2019t make sense. \u201cHow is that relevant?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been around long enough to know how irritating he can get when he\u2019s upset.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Stiles says, because Allison and Scott had an argument last week and the hour of angst it caused was one of the worst experiences of Stiles\u2019 life. \u201cBut why are you here?\u201d\nDerek crosses his arms over his chest and glares into the shadowy corner of Stiles\u2019 room and says, \u201cThey said you\u2026 smelled sad.\u201d\nStiles just stares. Finally, he drops his bat, kicks it back under his bed, and says, \u201cDo I?\u201d\nDerek shoots him a quick look. \u201cYou smell like. Like sweat. And jerking off.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d\n\u201cYou asked.\u201d\nStiles makes an inarticulate sound of rage and reaches for the bat again, and Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cAnd yes,\u201d he snaps. \u201cYou smell sad. Why?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I thought they were my friends and then I realized that they were just\u2026 doing surveillance. For you.\u201d\nDerek cocks his head, studying Stiles for a long moment. \u201cWhat the hell gave you that idea? I don\u2019t need my betas to conduct surveillance for me - if I wanted you watched, I\u2019d do it myself.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is also fucking creepy and possibly an explanation for you sneaking into my room in the middle of the night, but whatever. Listen. Derek. I\u2019m not stupid. I know -- well, I thought Scott liked me. And Allison. Maybe Malia and Cora. Maybe Liam. But I\u2019m not stupid. Lydia will never think I am cool enough to invite to her birthday party.\u201d\n\u201cLydia invited you to her birthday and that\u2019s what caused this --\u201d he gestures around Stiles\u2019 room, like the place has been contaminated by Stiles\u2019 despair and his frustrated hormones. \u201cThis entire mess?\u201d\nIt sounds stupid when Derek says it like that, but Stiles just can\u2019t think of another reason why a group of the most attractive, popular kids in school would go out of their way to hang out with him.\nHe crosses his arms over his chest and stares at his bare toes and says, \u201cThere\u2019s no way she actually wants me there.\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t,\u201d Derek agrees bluntly. \u201cBut she\u2019s pack. And pack does what is best for the pack, even if it goes against what you personally want. And the pack -- most of the pack -- wants you at that party because they fucking like you.\u201d\nStiles glances up at him through his lashes and bites his lip and hesitates for a moment. \u201cThey -- they do?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Stilinski. They do.\u201d Derek rolls his eyes so hard, it\u2019s gotta hurt. \u201cSo please answer your fucking phone because despite whatever you may be thinking, I have more important things to be doing rather than solving high school melodramas.\u201d\nStiles can\u2019t help a small, grateful smile, even as he says, soft, \u201cYeah, like lurking outside my house.\u201d\nDerek scowls, cheeks a little pink. \u201cI run the perimeter every night,\u201d he says gruffly. \u201cAnd part of that involves checking on the houses of -- of people in my pack. And people of interest to my pack.\u201d\n\u201cLike -- like enemies? Pack enemies?\u201d he asks, uncertain.\nDerek growls a little as he pulls himself out the window again. \u201cLike friends, Stiles. Jesus.\u201d\nAnd then he\u2019s gone.\n*\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Lydia says with a fake sweet smile. \u201cYou made it. Awesome.\u201d\nStiles hands her a clumsily wrapped birthday gift and a tacky foil balloon in the shape of an otter and says, \u201cHappy birthday, Lydia, it\u2019s a sweater and the receipt so you can exchange it at your leisure.\u201d\nHer fake smile goes a little wry and honest. \u201cYou know me so well. Please, for the love of god, go find Scott and put him out of his misery. He\u2019s out back.\u201d\nStiles nods gratefully and slips past, making his way towards the back yard.\nLydia\u2019s house is huge and it takes longer than it should, even though the house is much emptier than he\u2019d imagined it would be. He\u2019d sort of pictured a high school rager complete with makeshift dance floors, hip hop music, and popular people grinding on the couches, stairways and in the bedrooms.\nInstead, he finds the Hale pack clustered around a bonfire, roasting smores while Jackson plays a terrible rendition of Stairway to Heaven on an ill-tuned guitar.\n\u201cStiles!\u201d Scott says, beaming and jumping to his feet. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d make it!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well. Turns out my other plans didn\u2019t work out,\u201d Stiles says gamely, hugging Scott back when Scott bounces into his personal space.\n\u201cAmazing. We have booze. Well. The humans have booze. Doesn\u2019t work well on the the wolves.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cDoes it work for foxes?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says, and Scott\u2019s eyes go wide as he leans close, whispering conspiratorily.\n\u201cWe have some wolfsbane brew, Lydia made it for us, gets us drunk, do you want to try some, I won\u2019t tell Derek.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t tell me what?\u201d\nStiles jumps -- he\u2019s not used to people sneaking up on him, his foxy senses usually picking up the sounds of footsteps, heartbeats, but Derek is quiet and moves fast.\n\u201cScott\u2019s trying to get me drunk, probably to get into my pants,\u201d Stiles confesses automatically, even as Scott starts loudly confessing his innocence and everyone else cracks up.\n\u201cGlad you came,\u201d Derek says, quiet, as he brushes by, close enough that their shoulders touch.\nStiles is glad too, taking the spot Scott makes for him, and the marshmallows Liam passes over.\nIt\u2019s a good night, full of laughing, teasing, a few flashes of wolfy eyes that make Stiles want to turn tail and run. He doesn\u2019t, though, and by midnight, he\u2019s slumped against Scott\u2019s side, stomach aching from laughing.\n*\n\u201cSo,\u201d Jackson says after gym class, leaning a hip against Stiles\u2019 locker and one elbow up over Stiles\u2019 head. It\u2019s a deliberately lazy move, puts him all up in Stiles\u2019 space, and Stiles isn\u2019t sure he likes it.\nSure, Jackson\u2019s pretty.\nBut he\u2019s also an asshole.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Stiles asks, making himself look busy, shuffling through a binder like he\u2019s looking for something.\n\u201cFull moon tonight.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles says, smirking a little. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re acting so squirrelly.\u201d\nJackson\u2019s been fucking weird this week. Hovering in Stiles\u2019 personal space, watching him a little too close, being a little touchy. If Stiles wasn\u2019t a realist, he\u2019d worry that Jackson\u2019s got a crush.\nBut this is reality and Stiles is not delusional and Jackson is far out of his league and possibly playing a sport that Stiles isn\u2019t sure he even wants in on.\nSure, he\u2019s got a thing for assholes, but usually they\u2019ve got to have fluffy marshmallow centres, and he\u2019s pretty sure Jackson just\u2026 doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cJust wondering if you were coming out with us.\u201d\nStiles cocks his head, finally giving Jackson his full attention. \u201cOut,\u201d he echoes. \u201cWith you. And your\u2026 wolfy friends. On a full moon.\u201d\n\u201cDerek has a bonfire, a barbecue, a whole thing, out in the Preserve. We run together.\u201d\nStiles isn\u2019t 100 per cent sure but he thinks Jackson just, like. Flexed his pecs. What the fuck.\n\u201cThat\u2019s cool. Cool,\u201d Stiles says, narrowing his eyes on Jackson\u2019s lacrosse jersey, trying to see if that was really a jumping pec muscle or if Jackson had just developed some sort of twitch. Either way, he ought to get it checked out by a doctor. \u201cBut why would I want to be there? I\u2019m not a wolf.\u201d\n\u201cNeither\u2019s Allison and she comes,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cSo does Lydia, and Kira.\u201d\nStiles isn\u2019t sure what Lydia is but he knows it\u2019s something not quite human. He\u2019d asked Scott about it once and Scott had gotten all awkward and said it was her story to tell, and thus far, she hadn\u2019t chosen to tell it. Allison, as far as he could tell, was a badass with a bow, and Kira had some sort of electrical thing that involved a sword and it was all incredibly hot and distracting and all three of them are, as far as he can tell, amazing. Much more amazing than werewolves, which made them exponentially more amazing than a mangy werefox.\n\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cBut why would I want to --\u201d\nJackson goes a little tight around the eyes. \u201cDerek\u2019ll be there,\u201d he grumbles finally.\nAnd that\u2019s\u2026 well. It\u2019s a thing. An ill advised thing, but Stiles dares anybody with a heartbeat and a passing appreciation for the male form to look at Derek shirtless and doing pull ups for the fucking fun of it not to fall in love just a little with his abs.\nSure, Jackson\u2019s got dancing pecs, but Derek\u2019s got\u2026 everything.\nAnd if Jackson is out of Stiles\u2019 league, Derek is out of his entire sport.\nBut Stiles can allow himself the pleasure of enjoying Derek\u2019s Derekness from a distance. And he likes to. As often and in as many positions as he can.\nBut it\u2019s possible he\u2019s been a little obvious with his lusting after the dude if even oblivious Jackson has picked up on it.\nStiles stares at him, eyes narrowed, and then jabs him in the offending pec with one finger and says, \u201cWhatever you think you know, you don\u2019t know,\u201d and also, \u201cWill he be wearing a shirt?\u201d\nJackson rolls his eyes. \u201cWe strip,\u201d he says bluntly. \u201cI don\u2019t know how foxes do it, but wolves don\u2019t like to get tangled in their fucking underwear.\u201d\n\u201cI am in,\u201d Stiles declares. \u201cBut only because I want smores, not because of any --\u201d he waves a hand around. \u201cLusting.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Jackson says, knocking his fist against Stiles\u2019 locker once before straightening up. \u201cWhatever you say, Stilinski.\u201d\nHe walks away with a goddamn saunter and Stiles can\u2019t help but watch the line of his hip as he does.\nGoddamn werewolves.\n*\nThe woods are dark and Stiles feels an instinctive urge to head for home, to hide and pretend this isn\u2019t happening. Foxes aren\u2019t connected to the moon the way wolves are, but it\u2019s still an energy he can feel, a vibration in his bones.\nThey\u2019d gathered out at Derek\u2019s place in the Preserve, and Stiles had recognized it as the place he\u2019d woken up in after he\u2019d gotten caught in that trap. There was a different sort of energy than at Lydia\u2019s birthday party -- that had been relaxed, fun and lazy.\nTonight, everyone was snappy, keyed up, eager to run.\n\u201cYou gonna run with us?\u201d Jackson asks, a smirky sort or grin on his lips. He\u2019s already stripping out of his clothes, and he\u2019s hot. Stiles knows objectively, Jackson is hot. Hell, he\u2019s seen him mostly naked in the locker room.\nBut tonight with the energy of the moon an almost palpable force Stiles finds himself unable to make eye contact. He\u2019s blushing and his mouth is dry and his skin feels over-sensitive.\n\u201cCan I?\u201d Stiles asks. He\u2019d kinda figured he\u2019d just hang out with the humans or nearly humans back at the house. Allison and Kira had plans involving chickflicks and ice cream that sound pretty good.\n\u201cSure,\u201d Jackson says, snapping his teeth. They\u2019re just a little too sharp. \u201cGive us something to hunt.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you, Jackson,\u201d Scott says, growling a little. \u201cHe\u2019s joking. We\u2019re not gonna hunt you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Erica purrs, wrapping both arms around Stiles from behind, draping herself over his back. \u201cStiles would make delicious prey.\u201d\n\u201cBack off,\u201d Derek snaps, and Erica pouts but obeys leaving Stiles off-balance and twitchy. Derek cuffs him on the back of the neck, letting his hand linger there, and says, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine if you want to run with us.\u201d His voice is low and earnest. \u201cI won\u2019t let any of them hurt you, and there aren\u2019t any traps out there. Those hunters were dealt with and we ran the Preserve earlier to make sure it was safe.\u201d\nStiles shudders remembering that trap snapping shut around him. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, clearing his throat when his voice comes out hoarse.\nDerek\u2019s smile is small and careful but his eyes light up. \u201cYeah?\u201d\nStiles shrugs like it\u2019s not a big deal - like he\u2019s ever shifted in front of someone who wasn\u2019t his mother before. \nHe tugs off his shirt with a little bit of defiance and tosses it onto the pile with Jackson\u2019s and Scott\u2019s. \u201cSure,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes linger on his chest for a moment, dilating and glowing a little red, and then he fixes his gaze at something over Stiles\u2019 shoulder and says, \u201cI\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d\nStiles\u2026 Stiles believes him.\nWhen the fuck did that happen?\n*\nThe woods are dark and Stiles is on four paws, dashing through the shadows. He\u2019s smaller, more agile, able to slip through trails the wolves can\u2019t navigate, and he loses them easily.\nThe vibration of the moon, the adrenaline in his veins that spikes whenever a wolf howls, all of it combines into an electric sort of energy that sends him running faster and farther than he\u2019s ever run before. \nIt feels like his heart is going to burst but if it does, it\u2019ll be the best way to die.\nStiles usually doesn\u2019t feel like prey as a fox -- there are too many mice, rats and rabbits to hunt, and not many big predators, especially in the city with his mother. Here, though, the forest is teeming with wolves and it just adds to the sharp-edged energy coursing through his veins.\nA wolf catches up with him soon enough, as his paws start to tire and he slows. The teeth snapping playfully at the fluffy tip of his tail gives him a burst of speed and he scrambles up a fallen tree trunk laying at an angle up an embankment, ducks around a boulder, and scrambles up on top of it, hoping he\u2019s too clever for whichever wolf is chasing him.\nFor a moment or two, it works, and then the wolf leaps out of the shadows and knocks Stiles clear off the boulder, sending him tumbling onto the grass. Before he can get up, the wolf has him pinned.\nThe wolf shudders and shifts above him and it\u2019s Jackson, grinning with two many teeth, his hand holding Stiles pinned to the ground as he ignores Stiles\u2019 snapping teeth.\n\u201cGot you,\u201d Jackson says, and then a dark shape darts out of the shadows and slams into him with a vicious snarl.\nThere\u2019s a sudden scent of blood in the air and Jackson whines, shifting again and slinking off into the woods.\nThe big wolf disappears a heartbeat later and it\u2019s Derek, looking a little feral. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d he asks, almost a growl.\nStiles is in a predicament. On one hand, he wants to squirm away and run -- on the other, Derek looks fierce and upset and his eyes are burning red and Stiles\u2026 Stiles wants to roll over and submit. And he can\u2019t answer the question without shifting back to human and, well. Then he\u2019ll be naked.\nAnd Derek is already naked.\nAnd Stiles does his best but even with his fox vision, he can\u2019t see more than the hint of the angles and planes of his body, brushed with moonlight.\nHe\u2019d lean a little to the left and tip his head for a better look, but. Well. Derek would probably notice.\nSo he yips playfully, hops forward, nips at the line of his jaw (it\u2019s an act of submission, he knows it is, and it prickles low in his stomach, and he ignores it).\nDerek growls, low, an instinctive reaction to Stiles\u2019 teeth near his throat, and then Stiles dances back, flicks his tail, and runs.\nIt\u2019s an invitation to chase and Derek picks up on it, back in wolf form a moment later and tearing through the underbrush after him.\nStiles can feel his breath, can hear his heartbeat, and everything else is lost under the rush of it, the thrill of it, as he tries to lose Derek in the trees.\nIt doesn\u2019t work, but Derek never tackles him, never pins him, just follows wherever Stiles is willing to lead.\n*\nIt\u2019s nearly dawn when Stiles\u2019 little paws give up and he throws himself to the ground, panting, in a moonswept clearing. He rolls on his back, twisting a little, tongue lolling, breathing in the scent of clover, tree bark, pine needles, and Derek, who stands watching, like he doesn\u2019t understand what Stiles is doing.\nStiles flops onto his side and goes still, and Derek inches a little closer, sniffling at him, so Stiles makes a show of stretching and yawning and flopping in the grass again.\nIt\u2019s fucking nap time and he wants, more than anything, for Derek to curl up around him and keep him warm.\nHe lets his eyes slide shut and then there\u2019s a shiver on the air as Derek shifts. \u201cIf you fall asleep there,\u201d he says, voice hoarse from howling, \u201cYou\u2019ll wake up human and naked and if your dad finds you like that out here with me, he\u2019ll kill me.\u201d\nStiles opens one eye and tries to care, but he just\u2026 doesn\u2019t. He closes his eye again.\nDerek laughs, low and husky and it\u2019s something worth opening his eyes for, so Stiles does, just as Derek runs a hand slowly down his back, smoothing his fur, brushing grass out of it, and Stiles doesn\u2019t know if foxes can purr, but he wants to try.\n\u201cBrat,\u201d Derek says, quiet, and then he\u2019s a wolf again, nosing at Stiles until Stiles gives in and gets up with a grumble.\nDerek keeps herding him with gentle, firm nudges, leading towards home, and Stiles is tired. He doesn\u2019t have whatever magic the moon sends coursing through wolfy veins. He needs a nap.\nHe does his best, stumbling along, tail and ears drooping, casting baleful glares at Derek, and then he gets an inspired idea, and before Derek can react, he hops easily up onto his back.\nDerek as a wolf is big and muscular and there\u2019s plenty of room for Stiles to stretch out, snuggling into his thick fur, even as Derek stands still, startled, beneath him.\nFinally, with a huff, Derek starts walking the rest of the way home, and Stiles knows he\u2019s more careful now, not running or leaping or doing anything to knock Stiles off, which he appreciates, he does.\nAnd he\u2019ll tell him so. After he naps.\n*\nStiles wakes up to springtime sunshine cresting over the treeline, spilling through the windows of Derek\u2019s house.\nHe\u2019s naked and curled up with half a dozen naked peers, and Derek, tucked up against his back with one arm wrapped around his stomach.\nStiles blinks and lets all of that sink into his sleepy mind, and then resolutely closes his eyes.\nHe\u2019s not gonna be the first one to deal with this, no way. He can wait out the wolves as they sleep off whatever lingering effects the moon left in their veins. He can.\nExcept he can hear Allison, Lydia and Kira in the kitchen, talking and laughing softly and -- he sniffs -- apparently making breakfast.\nAnd Stiles has always been terrible at holding still.\nHe eases his way out of Derek\u2019s grip, over Scott\u2019s legs, inches around Boyd\u2019s naked back, and deliberately avoids making eye contact with Erica\u2019s boobs, and then he\u2019s free, tugging the first shirt he finds up over his head -- it\u2019s too big, it\u2019s way too big, it\u2019s definitely not his. He sniffs the neckline and it smells like Derek and something small and sweet and soft curls up in his chest.\nHe avoids making eye contact with that, too, and pulls on some pants that are definitely not his.\nAllison greets him with a bright grin when he stumbles into the kitchen. \u201cOh, hey! Usually the pack doesn\u2019t wake up til noon after the full moons.\u201d\n\u201cProbably a wolf thing,\u201d Stiles says. His voice his hoarse and Lydia rolls his eyes but slides him a glass of orange juice.\n\u201cButter the toast,\u201d she says, jerking her chin at the toaster, and Stiles drains the juice and obliges.\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost the same,\u201d Kira says, nudging him with her hip and smiling shyly. She\u2019s scrambling eggs on the stove. \u201cMe and you. We\u2019re both foxes.\u201d\nStiles looks at her, startled, and breathes deeply, but her scent is still strange, run through with electric current, and nothing at all like any fox he\u2019s ever scented.\n\u201cI\u2019m a kitsune,\u201d she tells him with a small shrug, biting her bottom lip and tucking her dark hair out of her eyes. \u201cFox spirit. Trickster.\u201d\nStiles looks from her to Allison to Lydia and back again. \u201cAnd you guys are -- Derek lets you be in the pack?\u201d\n\u201cDerek didn\u2019t have much of a choice,\u201d Lydia says primly, whipping up more eggs. \u201cIf he wanted Jackson, he had to have me. If he wanted Scott, he had to accept Allison.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I just.\u201d Kira shrugs again. \u201cCame along with Malia?\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s his cousin,\u201d Allison explains. \u201cSort of.\u201d\n\u201cAnd also a coyote, in case you couldn\u2019t tell that.\u201d Lydia purses her lips a little. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d\nStiles butters some toast, stacking it and thinking it over. He\u2019s got so many questions but doesn\u2019t know where to start. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like any of the wolf packs my mother warned me about,\u201d he says finally.\n\u201cDerek\u2019s Pack is different,\u201d Lydia tells him. \u201cSo I\u2019m not sure any of her warnings would apply.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely not the regular sort of alpha,\u201d Kira agrees. \u201cHe was never raised to be alpha.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he really sucked at it, at first,\u201d Allison adds, pulling herself up to sit on the counter, watching Lydia scrambling the eggs. \u201cBut he got better. We all got better.\u201d\nStiles knows a little bit about the Hale history -- Derek, losing his entire family in a tragic fire, except for Cora and Malia and an Uncle Peter who he\u2019s never met. Scott had told him all about it, about becoming a werewolf after being attacked by Derek\u2019s crazy uncle, how Derek had come back to Beacon Hills to kill his uncle and had inherited the pack almost by accident. And Uncle Peter, apparently, hadn\u2019t quite stuck to being dead.\nIt\u2019s a crazy story and Stiles has so many fucking questions.\nHe doesn\u2019t ask any of them because it doesn\u2019t seem his place to ask, and because he figures if he\u2019s gonna ask anyone, it should be Derek.\n\u201cMy mom told me wolves and foxes didn\u2019t get along, and I shouldn\u2019t ever let anyone other than other foxes like me know what I am, and even then\u2026 foxes don\u2019t really have a pack.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about other packs,\u201d Allison says, like it\u2019s easy. \u201cBut we don\u2019t discriminate. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a place for you in Derek\u2019s pack if you want it.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t her place to offer, but Stiles appreciates it all the same.\n*\nHe goes home before the wolves wake up, because it seems easier than dealing with the whole pile of naked puppies issue, and easier than getting Jackson alone to ask what the fuck his problem was, after the whole stalking thing, and especially after the way Jackson seemed to have gone from World\u2019s Biggest Asshole to World\u2019s Biggest Asshole Who Seems To Be Flirting. With Stiles. Like that\u2019s a thing that happens.\nIt isn\u2019t. Stiles knows his appeal and it isn\u2019t there for guys like Jackson.\nOr Derek. Which is a tragedy no matter how he looks at it, so he doesn\u2019t.\nInstead, he goes about life as normal. He goes to school, he hangs out with Scott, he sometimes hangs out with more of Scott\u2019s wolfy friends, he sees Derek lurking around sometimes, but everything is kind of normal.\nAnd then all of a sudden, it\u2019s not.\nThe witch starts stalking Beacon Hill virgins as graduation looms on the horizon, and at first, Stiles doesn\u2019t even know it\u2019s happening. Sure, his dad is extra busy at work, trying to solve a few missing persons cases, there\u2019s one brutal murder that Stiles does his best to get sordid details from his dad about, but other than that, there\u2019s homework and gaming with Scott and that\u2019s about all.\nThey go bowling -- Stiles and Scott and Allison, and Stiles is totally cool with being the third wheel, he\u2019s used to it, so he has an amazing time, and then Allison and Scott are flirting as she pretends to show him how to make his shot, like he\u2019s never fucking bowled before, so Stiles makes his way to the concession stand because he\u2019s gonna need a blue raspberry slurpee with extra sugar to deal with this.\nAnd before he gets there, he runs into Liam, who\u2019s looking a little, well. Squirrelly. His eyes are flashing gold and his fingers are flexing and he\u2019s breathing hard, hunched in on himself in the hall leading to the bathroom, like he\u2019s trying to hide it.\nStiles doesn\u2019t know Liam well -- he\u2019s a freshman, a new werewolf, has temper problems. Other than that, the kid\u2019s just a hyperactive, naive sort of mystery who Stiles woke up naked with.\n\u201cHey, Liam?\u201d he asks, a quick look over his shoulder to make sure no one else is noticing Liam\u2019s wolfy little problem. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u201cDo I look okay?\u201d Liam hisses. It comes out slurred because he\u2019s got fangs. Shit. \u201cNo! No I am not okay!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up? Need to get out of here?\u201d Stiles isn\u2019t an expect on wolves but he knows a little about control, and usually avoiding whatever is inspiring the lack of it is the first step to keep from losing your shit and shifting in public.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up? Hayden\u2019s here,\u201d he moans. \nStiles doesn\u2019t know a Hayden, but he looks around again. Liam\u2019s younger friends are all cheering each other on excitedly a few lanes away from Allison and Scott, and if there\u2019s a Hayden here, Stiles doesn\u2019t recognize her.\n\u201cBehind the counter,\u201d Liam says, pointing.\nThere\u2019s a cute girl working the shoe counter. Right. \u201cAnd Hayden is\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMy worst nightmare.\u201d\nLiam\u2019s cheeks are pink and growing furry and Stiles does not have time for these young werewolf hormonal situations.\n\u201cRight. Okay. Why don\u2019t we get you out of here? C\u2019mon.\u201d\nHe takes Liam\u2019s arm, hauling him out of the bowling alley and propping him up against the brick wall outside, grabbing his phone and texting Scott real quick, letting him know that something\u2019s come up and he\u2019ll see him tomorrow.\nChances are, Scott\u2019s not gonna notice he\u2019s gone, but whatever.\n\u201cYou got your phone?\u201d Stiles asks, and Liam takes a deep, shuddery breath and pulls it out of his pocket, unlocking it for him.\nIt only takes a moment or two to find Derek\u2019s name in Liam\u2019s contacts, and he hits call and takes a few steps away to give Liam time to catch his breath and rein in the claws.\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Derek answers.\n\u201cHey, Derek, it\u2019s, uh. Stiles.\u201d\nInstantly, Derek\u2019s voice is a little less snappy but much more gruff. \u201cAre you okay.\u201d\n\u201cYou need to learn to punctuate,\u201d Stiles tells him. \u201cListen, one of your little wolves is having a bit of a control problem, I just wanted to let you know. I mean, I think he\u2019s fine? But there\u2019s also a possibility that he\u2019s about to stalk a girl in his class and either lick her over or disembowel her, so I thought I ought to let you know, because I\u2019m a tiny bit worried that he\u2019s not going to react well when I try to shove him in my car.\u201d\nDerek growls. \u201cFucking Liam. Bring him home, he\u2019ll be fine. He won\u2019t hurt you. None of them will hurt you.\u201d\nIt sounds something like a promise.\n\u201cUh, cool. Okay. Thanks.\u201d\nHe hangs up before Derek can answer, and hustles Liam into his Jeep.\nLiam is much calmer by the time they get to his place, fangs carefully tucked away, eyebrows firmly in place, and he looks pretty sheepish.\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna hurt her,\u201d he says, scowling at the dashboard. \u201cI just. She just gets in my head. And it\u2019s hard to stay in control.\u201d\n\u201cYou gotta work on that,\u201d Stiles tells him, serious. \u201cYou can\u2019t go losing control because a pretty girl makes you mad or whatever. You can hurt people, Liam.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 hard.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be harder if you come down after losing your shit and found out you hurt her. Get your shit together and stay away from her until you do.\u201d\nHe leans over, shoves the door open, because he\u2019s tired and he doesn\u2019t have time for this. \n\u201cYeah. Okay.\u201d Liam slumps out of the car and drags himself miserably up to his house and Stiles watches to make sure he gets in okay.\nThen he texts Derek\u2019s number -- which he never asked permission to have but he\u2019s not gonna feel bad about it, no -- and says, \u201cLittle wolf safe at home.\u201d\nDerek texts back almost instantly. \u201cThx.\u201d\nStiles snorts and heads home.\nHe gets halfway there before the world suddenly gets darker, the stars winking out and shadows growing thicker, and then his Jeep just\u2026 dies.\nAnd there\u2019s a woman dressed in rags standing on the road a few feet in front of his car, all cast in shadows.\nStiles freezes. He\u2019s not even sure his heart is beating but one thing he knows before is that he is completely fucked and something has gone very, very wrong.\nHe should run. He should shift and run as far and fast as he can.\nThe woman starts walking towards his Jeep, lifting a hand that glows bone white in the darkness, that\u2019s crisscrossed with scars.\nAnd Stiles fumbles for his phone and calls Derek.\nDerek answers and Stiles doesn\u2019t give him the chance to say anything, just starts to babble. \u201cSo either it\u2019s Halloween early or there\u2019s a scary woman in a costume about to murder me, Derek, and I think it\u2019s probably that one because it\u2019s real dark and my Jeep stopped working and I -- and I --\n\u201cWhere are you? Stiles. Where--\u201d\nThe woman tears the door off his Jeep like it\u2019s easy and Stiles kicks out at her, losing his phone as he does, and when his feet make contact, her chest crunches beneath them like leaves in the fall.\n\u201cOh god, oh shit,\u201d Stiles gasps, and she wraps a cold hand around his ankle and pulls.\nShe looks frail but she\u2019s strong enough to drag him from the Jeep, sending him falling to the pavement, and her hood falls as she stands above him.\nHer face is a raised, dried network of scarring with two dark eyes and a slash of a mouth and Stiles can\u2019t help scrambling back and screaming.\nHe tries to shift but she lifts a hand and closes her fist and it\u2019s like all the magic inside him is cut off, like he\u2019s being strangled, and he can\u2019t breathe, nevermind become a fox.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s interesting,\u201d she purrs, falling to her knees beside him. \u201cYour blood is like nothing I\u2019ve ever tasted, Stiles. A virgin and a shifter? Your blood will sustain me for years.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 heart is beating rabbit fast and he can\u2019t move, can\u2019t think, can\u2019t breathe, and she\u2019s got a wickedly sharp knife in her hand, at his throat, and he\u2019s going to die like this, on a random road halfway home, all because Liam couldn\u2019t keep his goddamn hormones under control.\nAnd he\u2019s going to become one of the horrific murders or missing persons cases his dad has been working on in the last few weeks.\nThey\u2019d worried it was a serial killer but it was a goddamn witch.\nShe uses the knife to cut open his shirt, from neck to hem, pushing it open with a brush of cold hands.\n\u201cHold still, Stiles,\u201d she says, a rasp that makes him want to scream, before she draws the knife down his chest, making a shallow cut that stings more than anything and quickly wells up with blood. She runs her fingers through the blood and begins to paint sigils on his chest, his neck, his face, with his own blood that dries sticky.\nStiles just keeps gasping like a fish out of water, fighting against the paralysis, but he can\u2019t fucking move.\nHis temples are wet and sticky like the rest of him and it takes him a moment to realize that it\u2019s from tears, not blood.\n\u201cAlmost done,\u201d she says, like she\u2019s trying to be sweet. She brings one bloody thumb up to her lips and sucks the blood off of it and it\u2019s like her face shifts, shimmers, a younger mask dropping over the ruined skin -- and it\u2019s his English teacher.\nAnd then she presses the blade to his throat.\nThe knife burns cold against his skin and Stiles wants to close his eyes but he can\u2019t.\nSo he sees every brutal, bloody part of Derek appearing, dark and huge in his wolf form, and tearing her off him by the throat.\nShe screams curses as she dies, dark magic arches out and up from her clawed finger tips, dying before it can do any harm, as the curses turn to wordless screams of pain and then strangled gurgles because her throat\u2019s been torn out.\nDerek doesn\u2019t stop tearing her apart until she\u2019s stopped breathing and as soon as she does, with a snap, the paralysis is gone and Stiles can draw a full breath.\nHe wants to scream or cry or something but he can\u2019t -- can just lay there, gasping, while his blood runs onto the pavement with his tears.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says, urgent, leaning over him just as the witch had done. \u201cYou\u2019re okay. You\u2019re okay.\u201d\nHe pulls Stiles up so he\u2019s sitting, tries to pull the torn remains of his shirt closed over his bleeding chest, and quickly gives up, tearing it from him to wipe at the blood instead.\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine,\u201d he says. \u201cStiles, tell me you\u2019re fine.\u201d\n\u201cI--I--\u201d Stiles is shivering, in shock. \u201cI need to call my dad. Derek, I need --\u201d and then he\u2019s crying brokenly and Derek is cursing and holding him too tight.\nWhen the sheriff arrives, Derek\u2019s wearing a pair of Stiles\u2019 gym shorts that are doing absolutely nothing to contain his thighs, and he\u2019s wrapped up tightly around Stiles, who is shirtless with blood smeared all over his chest and face. The wound on his chest has healed and he\u2019s stopped crying, but he\u2019s still shaking.\n\u201cStiles, Jesus,\u201d his dad says, falling to his knees beside them both, cupping Stiles\u2019 face with both hands, scanning him for injuries. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nHe looks at Derek, at the torn up body, and then at Stiles again. \u201cShit,\u201d he says. \u201cShit, Stiles do you need a hospital?\u201d\nAnd then he crushes Stiles into a hug, shaking nearly as badly as Stiles is, and Stiles says against his shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m okay. Dad. I\u2019m okay. I swear. Derek got here in time -- this is. This is what all those safe sex lectures get you, dad. If I hadn\u2019t been a virgin, she wouldn\u2019t have -- wouldn\u2019t have tried --\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Stiles,\u201d his dad says tiredly, smoothing his hair back. \u201cJust. I\u2019m so glad -- so glad --\u201d\nShit, his dad is going to cry.\nStiles hugs him back hard, holding onto the back of his uniform and taking a few shaky breaths to get himself under control. He meets Derek\u2019s gaze over his dad\u2019s shoulder and says, \u201cDerek, you gotta go. The police are coming and you don\u2019t wanna be linked to this shit show. Dad, I\u2019m okay. I already healed. Derek stopped her before she could do whatever she was going to do. I\u2019m okay.\u201d\nIt takes him a long time to convince his dad to let him go, and longer to convince Derek to go home.\nThey tell the deputies and paramedics that Stiles had come upon the scene to see an animal attacking an old woman and he\u2019d stopped his Jeep and tried to intervene. The animal had run off but the woman had already been dead and all the blood was hers.\nThe murders and missing persons cases stop.\nAnd Stiles doesn\u2019t sleep for a long time.\n*\n\u201cA few years ago, Beacon Hills was a mess for this kind of thing,\u201d Scott tells him, while they sit together playing Halo. \u201cIt was like every week, another monster. Derek was a new alpha and it was like the entire supernatural community was coming out to test his strength. It\u2019s a pretty powerful territory, but we got our shit together and got stronger and now, it doesn\u2019t happen so much.\u201d\nStiles swallows hard and focuses on the game and says, \u201cShe was gonna drink my blood to help look young and, uh.To keep up her disguise, I guess.\u201d\nScott dies in a hail of bullets and says, \u201cLydia\u2019s mom is gonna sub til they find a long term replacement and Derek thinks you blame him.\u201d\nIt takes a beat for the words to register, and then Stiles shoots him an uncertain look. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I --\u201d\nScott shrugs and says, \u201cWell, he\u2019s the alpha. It\u2019s his job to keep Beacon Hills safe. And he specifically said he\u2019d keep you safe. And then you almost died. And now you\u2019re avoiding him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not -- I\u2019m not avoiding him,\u201d Stiles argues, still stunned. \u201cI\u2019m.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know how to say \u2018afraid to leave my house\u2019 without sounding pathetic. \u201cI\u2019m just. I didn\u2019t know he\u2019d notice.\u201d\nScott gives up on the game entirely, turning to face him and looking perplexed. \u201cDude, of course he\u2019s going to notice. You\u2019re pack.\u201d\nStiles laughs, a sputtering, stunned sort of laughter, and says, \u201cWhat? No I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you are.\u201d Scott frowns, shifting to cross his legs and lean closer, eyes narrowed. \u201cUnless -- do you not wanna be?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t -- it\u2019s not -- what I want doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Stiles tells him. \u201cI can\u2019t be pack. Pack is for wolves and I am not a wolf.\u201d\n\u201cLydia and Allison and Kira aren\u2019t wolves. Hell, Malia\u2019s not a wolf either if you\u2019re getting technical. That doesn\u2019t matter. I mean. Stiles, if you don\u2019t wanna be, that\u2019s cool.\u201d He looks like it breaks his heart to say it, but Stiles isn\u2019t going to call him out on it. \u201cBut you should maybe tell Derek before he gets anymore attached.\u201d\nAttached.\nStiles cocks his head and pauses the game and says, \u201cDid he -- when did he get attached?\u201d\nScott looks more confused than ever, and now a little angry too. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe when you spent all that time naked and raving with fever about how pretty his eyes were?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026 did not happen,\u201d Stile says. \u201cPlease tell me that didn\u2019t fucking happen.\u201d\n\u201cOr after, when you were all funny and charming and, you know.\u201d Scott gestures to Stiles as if it\u2019s supposed to mean something and Stiles just stares blankly. With a huge eye roll, Scott says, \u201cPretty and surprisingly muscular for such a narrow frame? I don\u2019t know, dude, you\u2019re hot. You obviously know that.\u201d\nStiles is not hot. Stiles has never been hot. Stiles has also never been at a loss for words before, but here he was, gaping like a fish. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he says finally.\n\u201cJackson spent an entire month trying to get into your pants because he knew Derek wanted to and he is a little shit who\u2019s got a problem with authority,\u201d Scott says dryly.\n\u201cI knew he didn\u2019t actually like me,\u201d Stiles says, and it should feel like a victory but it rings a little hollow. He takes a deep breath and and then says, \u201cIf Derek wanted\u2026 any of that. Then he\u2019d have talked to me more. Or something.\u201d\n\u201cDude. You\u2019re in high school. He\u2019s 22. And also he\u2019s a super powerful alpha werewolf trying to coax you into being in his pack without actually asking if you want to be because he\u2019s socially inept.\u201d\nStiles just. He can\u2019t. It\u2019s too much for his brain to handle, and he flops back onto his bed and buries his face in both hands and moans. \u201cThis can\u2019t be actually a thing that\u2019s happening,\u201d he says.\nScott pats his knee. \u201cHe\u2019s pining,\u201d he says, cheerful. \u201cSorry. He\u2019ll stop of you tell him to.\u201d\nStiles considers that. He thinks about Derek showing up whenever Stiles was hurt and needed help. Thinks about Derek easing the posion he\u2019d been hit with in that trap. Thinks about Derek offering a bunch of lonely, damaged kids the chance to belong to a real family, even if the family was awkward and strange and Jackson was part of it.\nHe thinks about Derek, shy and awkward and angry and sneaking into his window that night.\nHe thinks about Derek\u2019s hand running through his fur, and he thinks about waking up with Derek pressed up against his back, naked, arm tight around his stomach.\nHe peeks at Scott between his fingers and says, \u201cGraduation is in two weeks.\u201d\nScott flashes a chipper pair of finger guns and says, \u201cErica\u2019s got a countdown going on Derek\u2019s fridge and he hates it. But he hasn\u2019t taken it down.\u201d\n\u201cOh god,\u201d Stiles moans, hiding his face again.\n*\nThe thing about tracking Derek down and making him use his words like a good werewolf is that it means Stiles has to get his shit together enough to actually leave his house, and that\u2019s hard when his lack of sexual experience left him vulnerable to a witch looking for virgin sacrifices to keep up her ruse of teaching high school English.\nThe Crucible was decent as far as English assignments go but Stiles doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s really worth sacrificing virgins for.\nIt takes him three days to gather up his courage, and in those three days, Stiles types up and deletes at least a dozen texts to Derek before distracting himself cooking up healthy and nutritious freezer meals for his dad to keep stocked up for when Stiles goes away to college.\nIt\u2019s a dreary Tuesday when Stiles finally shoves his feet in his running shoes -- they\u2019ve got blood stains on them, he needs new fucking shoes -- and grabs a hoodie and steps outside.\n\u201cNot so scary,\u201d he says, scanning the street for any hint of threat. It\u2019s rainy, and other than Mrs. Henderson out walking her Yorkie, the street is quiet.\nHe twists his keyring nervously around his finger and then hops down the front steps, intending to drive out to Derek\u2019s place.\nAs soon as his feet hit the sidewalk, however, Derek says, \u201cShould you be out here alone?\u201d\nStiles yelps, spins around so quickly, he rolls his ankle, causing him to stagger sideways, catching himself on the side of his Jeep.\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d he says, staring at Derek, who\u2019s suddenly appeared beside the shrubbery lining Stiles\u2019 driveway. He\u2019s wearing that stupid leather jacket again, those same tight jeans, his hands shoved in his pockets and shoulders hunched. He looks wet and miserable, like he\u2019s been out here a while.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even have a coat. That sweater isn\u2019t waterproof. You\u2019ll catch a cold.\u201d\nStiles stares at the hoodie he\u2019s got clutched in a ball in his hands and then back at Derek and says, \u201cYou\u2019re worried I\u2019m gonna catch a cold?\u201d\nDerek shrugs, looking grumpy. \u201cWell. You don\u2019t seem to have the best sense of self-preservation.\u201d\nStiles pushes himself away from his jeep, taking a few steps closer to Derek, who watches him warily. \u201cThat witch wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d Stiles says, and his stupid voice has gone a little breathy.\nDerek swallows hard, eyes going dark. \u201cDid I thank you,\u201d he asks, licking the rain off his bottom lip before adding, \u201cFor looking after Liam that night? You didn\u2019t have to, and it nearly got you killed.\u201d\nStiles comes a little closer. \u201cCouldn\u2019t really let him go feral and attack a girl just because he\u2019s got a crush on her,\u201d he says. \u201cCould I?\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your problem to solve.\u201d\nStiles hesitates now, chewing his bottom lip in thought and watching Derek carefully. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Derek,\u201d he says, slow. \u201cIt kind of seems like that\u2019s something pack\u2019s supposed to do. Take care of each other.\u201d\nDerek looks a little wary, studying Stiles just as carefully as Stiles had looked at him a moment before. He rubs at the back of his neck, shifts on his feet, and Stiles almost thinks Derek is going to panic and run. He wonders if he\u2019d be able to catch him, and figures that maybe he can, in his fox form.\n\u201cAre you pack?\u201d Derek asks finally, abruptly.\nA few weeks ago, Stiles might have taken that to mean Derek didn\u2019t want him to be, but now he\u2019s not so sure. \u201cIf you want me to be,\u201d he says, quiet.\n\u201cYou\u2019re smart,\u201d Derek tells him. \u201cYou\u2019re clever and you\u2019re kind. You pay attention. You notice when people need you, even if you don\u2019t know them well. You\u2019ve gotten Lydia to warm up to you in only a few months. Scott would never let me forget it if I didn\u2019t let you into the pack.\u201d\n\u201cBut what about you,\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Derek says, and then he clears his throat, his cheeks a little pink as he glares at the ground and says, \u201cI mean. I want you in the pack. I want you--\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to go on a date with me some time,\u201d Stiles asks, all in a rush, and Derek stares at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in high school,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI\u2019m 18.\u201d\n\u201cYour dad\u2019s the sheriff and he knows every single way to kill a werewolf, we can\u2019t --\u201d\n\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles says, exasperated and fond and thinking that maybe, maybe Derek just as much of a social disaster as he is. \u201cI graduate in a week. And you\u2019re 22. My dad\u2019s not gonna kill you. You\u2019ve saved my life twice.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not really -- I put your life in danger twice,\u201d Derek corrects. \u201cThat trap never would\u2019ve--\u201d\n\u201cDerek.\u201d\nDerek snaps his mouth shut, scowling, and Stiles finally closes the distance between them, running his hands up the rain-slicked leather of his jacket, and straightening the collar. He can hear Derek\u2019s heartbeat speed up, just a little, as well as the way he breathes more deeply, like he can\u2019t quite help wanting to breathe Stiles in.\nStiles rubs a thumb along Derek\u2019s bottom lip, wiping the rain away, and he smiles brightly. \u201cMaybe we should talk about this next week. At Lydia\u2019s graduation party.\u201d\nDerek swallows hard and studies his eyes for a moment before his gaze follows a stream of rain that Stiles can feel build up on his eyelashes before spilling down, to his mouth.\nDerek doesn\u2019t look away for a long moment, and when he finally meets Stiles\u2019 eyes again, he says, almost helpless, \u201cA week\u2019s a long time to wait.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve probably been lurking outside my house for longer,\u201d Stiles laughs and it catches him off guard when Derek evidently decides that he\u2019s waited long enough, tugging Stiles that last half a step that separates them and kissing the laughter right off his mouth.\nIt only takes Stiles half a second to get into it, to forget about his laughter, about waiting, about his dad with a shotgun full of wolfsbane. He pushes up into the kiss, holding onto Derek\u2019s shoulders and forgetting all about the nightmares and worries that had kept him hidden in his house since the witch nearly killed him.\nWhen Derek finally lets him breathe, Stiles clings to his shoulders and pants, \u201cYou know the best way to keep me safe from crazy witches sacrificing virgins would be to fuck me, right?\u201d\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Derek laughs, and then he\u2019s taking Stiles by the hand and tugging him towards the front door. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to wait at least a week for that.\u201d\nStiles figured he\u2019s waited his whole life for somewhere to belong, so another week\u2026 well, that\u2019s nothing.\nThe End."
