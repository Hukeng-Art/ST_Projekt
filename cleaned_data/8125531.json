Rowling's rampant transphobia. As a non-binary creator, I feel unable to support her works in any way, as painful as that is given that, like so many of you, I grew up on Harry Potter. When a creator is still alive and profiting off of a series, and when her positions are increasingly harmful, I don't think death of the author is a sufficient justification to continue to support her work. </p>\n<p>I can't say that transphobia and racism and all the other harmful ideologies that JKR has espoused recently have no place in Harry Potter, because a critical reading of Harry Potter reveals those ideologies already present in the work. I think that everyone who grew up on the series must individually grapple with that fact. However this fic in particular, like many transformative works, was written to critique the original series. As much as this was, in September of 2016, a labor of my love for the Harry Potter universe, it also represented my deep dissatisfaction with the conclusion of the series and the ways in which it failed to resolve some of the fundamental moral questions it posed. I think that many of you who have read and supported this fic over the years (and I will never cease to be surprised at the number of you) appreciate it precisely for that dissatisfaction that it articulates. Therefore, I have decided to allow this work to remain up, and I hope that it brings some degree of comfort to people who are seeking a way to still engage with Harry Potter while divorcing it from J.K. Rowling herself.</p>\n<p>All Cops Are Bastards (including aurors), Black Lives Matter, Trans Rights are human rights, and fuck J.K. Rowling.</p>\n<p>Love to all of you,<br>Gedsparrowhawk</p>",
    "text": "\ni.\n\nIn late May of 2001, Harry Potter quietly apparated into Hogsmeade and slipped into Honeydukes. Dressed in unassuming muggle clothes, hands stuffed deep into his pockets, he looked very little like the savior of any world, let alone the wizarding one. He exchanged a quiet word with Ambrosius Flume and disappeared down the cellar steps. Few people had seen him arrive and nobody, not even Mr. Flume, saw him leave.\nHeadmistress McGonagall had contemplated, while repairing the castle whether it was prudent to close the secret passages to and from Hogsmeade, but magical buildings, especially ones as old as Hogwarts, have ideas of their own, and the castle quickly made it clear that it liked its secret passages exactly where they were. So, a passage still opened behind the One-Eyed Witch in the third floor corridor, out of which, with a curious range of emotions flitting across his face, Harry Potter emerged. McGonagall, waiting in the corridor, smiled at him in greeting.\nMinerva McGonagall\u2019s first impression on seeing the Savior of the Wizarding World again after three years was that he looked the same. Bright green eyes, hair that he didn\u2019t seem to even attempt to manage, those same ridiculous glasses. Older, though, healthier, and not tired and frightened anymore. And, perhaps, he looked less like James. Yes, there was that, too. Three years of peace had softened away some of the hardness in his features, and three years of maturity had grown him into his own person, no longer the mirror image of his father.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Mr. Potter,\u201d she said to him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be home,\u201d he answered, smiling faintly.\nThey stood silently for a moment, taking each other in.\n\u201cTo my office?\u201d she suggested, breaking the moment. \u201cOr would you rather see the repairs we\u2019ve done to the school?\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019d prefer no one knew I was here. At least for the time being,\u201d Harry said, delicately. \u201cSo maybe I can tour the school after term ends.\u201d\nMcGonagall nodded \u201cA wise choice,\u201d and, taking his arm, began guiding him to her office. \u201cYou\u2019ve created something of a stir, I must say, Mr. Potter. Disappearing again after the war like that. That horrible Skeeter woman has had quite a field day with speculation, though I dare say, no one believed her more wild conjectures.\u201d\nHarry laughed\u2014and that still sounded like James. \u201cWhat\u2019s she been saying now?\u201d\n\u201cI hardly keep up on the latest gossip,\u201d McGonagall said, sternly.\n\u201cOh, sorry, then,\u201d Harry said, clearly not meaning a word of it.\n\u201cBut Molly Weasley does, and she has been sure to tell me all about it,\u201d she continued. \u201cI believe the latest theory is that you have abandoned all obligations to magical Britain in pursuit of a scandalous relationship with an American witch, supported on the evidence of a single photo of you in New York city.\u201d\nHarry swore good-humoredly. \u201cI thought that was a magical camera flash, but I wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d\n\u201cNow the Quibbler, which I do subscribe to, has been publishing some very entertaining rebuttals to these pieces. According to Miss Lovegood, you have renounced the title of Chosen One and are sequestered somewhere in the American Midwest, learning the ancient secrets of wandless magic and forming an entirely new branch of magic.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cI can always count on Luna to make me sound far more interesting than I actually am,\u201d Harry said fondly. \u201cAnd she did know where I was.\u201d\n\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d McGonagall asked, unable to entirely suppress her curiosity. She had received a few owls from him, inquiring on the state of Hogwarts repairs and knew from Andromeda that he was diligent about visiting his godson, but other than that she had been left as in the dark as the rest of magical Britain.\nHarry shrugged at her side. \u201cAfter the year with the ministry rounding up the last of the Death Eaters? I\u2019ve been traveling. Spent some time in France for a while, and then on to Bulgaria and stayed with Victor Krum, you remember him. Learned some right nasty curses there that might have been useful, once upon a time.\u201d She hears rather than sees the wry smile in his words. \u201cThen six months in the States, with a muggle friend of Hermione\u2019s family. No one knew me there, that was nice, and out west there are some remnants of pre-colonial magic to be found still. More so I heard in South America, but I didn\u2019t make it there. And so on. Popping back across to see Teddy, of course, but he has his Gran, and Molly has practically adopted him\u2014all of the Weasleys have really. Finished up with a stint in the Netherlands, funding some promising werewolf research, but mostly just thinking.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now you\u2019re back,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAnd now I\u2019m back.\u201d\nThey stopped in front of the gargoyle that guarded the staircase to the Headmistress\u2019s office. Harry looked something between pained and sheepish. \u201cI still think of it as Dumbledore\u2019s office,\u201d he said, quietly.\nA complicated mix of emotions lurked behind that sentence, and McGonagall wisely chose to say nothing in return, save the password\u2014an obscure and high level transfiguration concept\u2014to make the Gargoyle jump aside.\nThey didn\u2019t speak again, all up the turning staircase, until they were seated in her office. She watched Harry take in all the changes she had made over her three-year tenure\u2014more books and fewer dangerous magical artifacts to start, and the pensieve packed away for good. On the walls, the portraits of Dumbledore and of Snape were both absent from their frames, but the other headmasters and headmistresses looked on keenly, although many of them were feigning sleep.\n\u201cYou understand, Professor,\u201d Harry began, after a moment, \u201cthat I don\u2019t have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn\u2019t seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.\u201d\n\u201cQuite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,\u201d McGonagall said, dryly.\nHe smiled and scratched at the dark stubble that had collected on his cheeks. \u201cJust being honest, Professor.\u201d\nHer eyes darted for half a second to the back of his left hand and the faint silvery scar there. The knowing look he gave her proved he saw it.\nShe recovered herself. \u201cMr. Potter, you defeated Voldemort at the age of seventeen after evading him for several months on the run and destroying some of the darkest magical artifacts known to wizardkind. At fifteen you organized secret meetings to teach defensive magic to your fellow students.\u201d\nHarry nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI hardly think it\u2019s necessary for me to recap all the mad things you and your friends got up to during your time at Hogwarts, but I will take a moment to remind you that you began your Hogwarts career as the eleven year old who defeated a mountain troll.\u201d\nHarry laughed and nodded. \u201cYou know, I had almost forgotten about that.\u201d\nMcGonagall leaned forward across her desk. \u201cRegardless of the status of your N.E.W.T.s, the lack of which I find perfectly understandable, there is no question that you are entirely overqualified to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts this coming academic year and for as many following years as you would like. I, in fact, have only one question for you.\u201d\n\u201cAsk.\u201d\nShe regarded him for a moment, relaxed before her like she had never seen him as an adult, and her voice softened to something almost motherly. \u201cWhy, Mr. Potter? You could have anything, be anything that you want. If you ran for Minister for Magic tomorrow, I feel quite sure you could win. Why come back here?\u201d\nIt was a serious question, and she could see Harry take it as such. He leaned back in chair and took a breath, as if collecting his thoughts before answering.\nHe sighed deeply. \u201cProfessor, I\u2019m tired,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been three years, almost to the day since I defeated Voldemort, and I am still\u2014I never asked for any of it: I only ever did what I didn\u2019t have a choice but to do. I bought back my parent\u2019s house in Godric\u2019s Hollow, did you know? Fixed it up again after some photos I found. And some part of me wants to hide in there and never come out again, bury myself in the past. But,\u201d his eyes flickered to the empty portrait where Dumbledore should have been, \u201cit does not do to dwell on dreams, especially dark ones. Let Hermione or Ron or, or Percy become Minister for Magic. Hogwarts is the only home I have ever known, and there are people here who need me but won\u2019t ask anything of me I can\u2019t do. And that, for me, is terribly rare.\u201d\nSomething deep inside of her, wrapped in layers of stern stoicism, grieved for Harry, for the baby that she let Dumbledore leave on a doorstep twenty years ago and for the boy she let walk to the slaughter, too young to be a martyr. \u201cHogwarts will always be here for you,\u201d she said, even as she remembered all the ways Hogwarts had failed Harry over and over again, \u201cas long as you will have it, Mr. Potter.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nii.\n\nDespite McGonagall\u2019s best efforts, the news that Harry had been hired as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher got out within the fortnight. Privately, she blamed some of the Headmaster portraits, who had been known to gossip before, but Harry Potter\u2019s permanent return to Britain had raised interest and speculation all by itself. Harry granted the first and only interview to the Quibbler, a move which McGonagall thoroughly approved of, and Luna spent half of the interview asking questions about Harry\u2019s fictional new magic style rather than his decision to take a position at Hogwarts. With every other paper having to go through Luna thereafter for statements from Harry, McGonagall was sure Miss Lovegood made a tidy sum off the entire affair.\nAs far as McGonagall knew, Harry spent the summer months with Andromeda and Teddy, although Molly\u2019s letters seemed to indicate that he spent plenty of time at the Burrow as well. As July wound down, she sent an owl requesting his curriculum plans for the year. She received them promptly: a thick muggle binder divided into seven sections, each outlining a very sensible plan of lessons for each year, beginning with basic defensive spells for the first years and culminating with high level dueling theory and practicals for the seventh years. A note stuck in the back pocket informed her that Hermione had been very helpful in creating the plans, and some fifth year lessons on battle strategy struck her as very much the work of Ron.\nThe biggest surprise of the whole affair, although in retrospect it seemed rather obvious, came a few weeks before the start of term when she received an unprompted owl bearing letters from both Harry and Andromeda. They were in agreement that Teddy ought to spend at least part of the year with his godfather, whom he had become quite attached to over the summer, and were inquiring as to the possibility of the boy staying for the autumn term with Harry at Hogwarts. McGonagall had privately resolved not to show any special preference for Potter and to hope the student body would follow her lead, but she determined this was not so much a favor for Harry as it was for the son of Remus and Tonks. She had no interest in seeing any more magical orphans grow up feeling anything less than fully and wholly loved. She wrote back agreeing that, if Harry and Andromeda were agreed that it was the best thing for Teddy, then she supposed that she could not object to it, as long as arrangements were made for someone to care for Teddy while Harry was teaching class.\nSeptember first dawned bright and clear and warm, and, glad as McGonagall was to see all the professors\u2014her friends\u2014return, it was Harry\u2019s arrival that she awaited most, with a mixture of apprehension and eagerness. He showed up around noon, accompanied by Neville Longbottom. Neville had begun apprenticing under Professor Sprout the year before, and McGonagall suspected him of suggesting the idea of teaching to Harry in the first place. Swinging between them was a small boy with bright pink hair that got more and more neon as they approached the castle.\n\u201cWelcome back to Hogwarts,\u201d she said to them as they entered the castle. \u201cAnd welcome to Hogwarts to you too, Mr. Lupin,\u201d she said bending to speak to Teddy.\nHis eyes went wide for a second, and then he hid behind his godfather who hoisted him up into a piggyback ride. \u201cSomeone\u2019s feeling a little shy,\u201d Harry said with a note of affection that McGonagall had not heard from him before. \u201cIt\u2019s been a big day for the little tyke. First side along apparation. First time seeing Hogwarts. We saw the giant squid sunning itself. And he\u2019s practicing controlling his hair color.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, look!\u201d Teddy piped up suddenly, poking his head out from behind Harry\u2019s. He screwed up his face in a look of intense concentration and slowly his hair faded from bright pink to match his godfather\u2019s black. \u201c\u2019m Harry now.\u201d\nMcGonagall clapped her hands together, \u201cVery good!\u201d\n\u201cBut I like pink,\u201d Teddy said, and, with another look of concentration, his hair popped back to bright pink.\n\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d Harry said. \u201cHe takes after his mother.\u201d\nThe house elves showed them to their rooms then, and McGonagall was left to greet the remaining professors and go over and over again in her head her opening remarks for that night. She wasn\u2019t surprised that Harry seemed to adore his godson, and she was glad to know that Teddy would never doubt that for a second.\nAt the feast that evening, all eyes were on Harry\u2019s seat at the High Table, the whispering only stopping for the sorting of the new first years. Even McGonagall couldn\u2019t help but sneak a glance at Harry. He looked fidgety in his new robes, less at ease than he had in his terrible muggle outfit, but some of that may just have been the novelty of sitting at the front of the Great Hall. Teddy was nowhere to be seen, but then, she realized with a barely suppressed smile, there was a suspiciously empty spot next to Harry that he seemed to keep patting. If that was his plan to take care of his godson for the entire term she might have to speak with him, but for now she decided to let it slide.\nAs the sorting concluded, McGonagall stood and with a look brought silence to the room. \u201cWelcome,\u201d she began, \u201cto all the new first years, as well as to all our returning students. I will keep this brief, as I\u2019m sure everyone is anxious to begin eating and full of summer gossip to tell their friends or legends to scare the first years,\u201d laughter at this, \u201cbut first some announcements.\n\u201cFirst, following the incidents last April, we ask that students do NOT bait Peeves the Poltergeist or attempt exorcisms against him. He may be a nuisance, but he has rendered services to this school that merit his placement here. Calling to Mr. Filch that you are out past curfew does not void that.\u201d A pointed look at some sheepish Slytherin fourth years.\n\u201cSecond, the arithmancy section of the library has now been fully repaired and students are once again allowed to check out books, although Madam Pince warns that the northernmost end of the transfiguration shelves remains somewhat unstable, especially around the half moon, and recommends that students who intend to get books from that area inform her and at least two separate friends beforehand. Third, as always, the Forbidden Forest remains entirely off limits except on excursions led by a professor. Those of you wishing to visit the centaur Firenze for extra-divination lessons are no exception. Professor Trelawney will be leading chaperoned expeditions twice a month. You may speak with her for further details.\u201d She paused a moment, taking a proper breath in.\n\u201cFinally, I am very pleased to announce that we have with us a new professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts, although I expect most of you already know this, Professor Potter.\u201d\nThere was a flurry of whispers throughout the room as more than one muggleborn first year had the very condensed version of the Second Wizarding War explained to them.\n\u201cI do not need to explain his qualifications to you. I ask that you treat Professor Potter with the same respect and courtesy you would treat any other professor,\u201d McGonagall said sternly. \u201cUnless other members of the staff have any announcements, however, it is high time this feast properly began.\u201d She took her seat and food appeared on the plates in front of the students, as the roar of conversation bubbled up.\nAt his seat down the table, Harry was surreptitiously passing food to his godson under the invisibility cloak.\n\u00a0\nAs McGonagall sat in her office the next day during the start of classes, she insisted to herself that it wasn\u2019t immoral, per se, to listen in on one of her new professor\u2019s lessons. If anything, it was prudent, and maybe if Dumbledore had done so he would have noticed that Moody had been replaced by an imposter, or that Lockhart was a fraud, or that Quirrel had Voldemort living on the back of his head. Not that McGonagall suspected any of that of Harry, but, well, she was curious, and there were wards that let her check in on any room in Hogwarts. So technically, yes, she was spying on Harry\u2019s lessons, but it wasn't wrong.\nShe felt uneasily like this was exactly the kind of thing Dumbledore would have approved of, but when she glanced at his portrait on the wall he appeared fast asleep. She conjured a shivering image of the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom before her.\nHarry\u2019s first class was at quarter to ten and a mix of Slytherin and Gyffindor fifth years. They would have been too young to have stayed and fought at the Battle of Hogwarts, but many of them would have seen it begin. Five minutes before class, they filed in, whispering to each other behind their hands, and Harry, sitting at his desk, checking over lessons plans, pretended not to notice. McGonagall saw him glance up as the students enter, but otherwise he made no acknowledgement of their presence until the minute hand on the clock behind him turned to quarter to exactly. He stood, and the whispering in the class stopped abruptly.\nShe expected\u2014well, she wasn\u2019t sure what she expected from him exactly. Maybe an acknowledgement of his credentials, or maybe a ban on asking questions, or maybe to just quietly start the lesson. Instead, he looked at the classroom and commented, \u201cThere\u2019s a funny thing I noticed back when I was in school,\u201d which sent up a rush of whispers all over again. \u201cSee, they put the Slytherins and the Gryffindors together in class, but the Slytherins always sit together and the Gryffindors always sit together, so why bother?\u201d McGonagall saw his eyes glint with a suppressed smirk, and she knew, just like she always knew when James or Sirius or Harry himself had been about to do something horrible, what was coming next. \u201cEveryone please stand up. I\u2019d like all Gryffindors to go to the left side of the room please, and all the Slytherins on the right.\u201d\nSomewhat confused but curious enough to give it a try, the students stood and did what he had asked them to. A few, either more astute or more familiar with Harry\u2019s wicked streak, groaned in anticipation.\n\u201cAll right then, you please, yes, you, Ms. Burke, to this desk please,\u201d Harry began, guiding Ms. Burke out of the Gryffindor group. \u201cAnd you please, Ms. Montague, next to her, thank you.\u201d Ms. Montague stepped out of the Slytherin huddle and sat down reluctantly with Ms. Burke.\nOne after another, Harry cheerfully separated the Slytherins and the Gryffindors, until the entire class, miserable and resentful, was seated in front of him again. \u201cThese are to be your seats for at least the next month, please. After that, if you find you still absolutely can\u2019t stand the people you are sitting next to, you may change. At the very least, this should cut down on the mysterious whispering problem we seemed to have had as you all came in, although if we\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll make friends with your new seatmates and that whispering problem will come back.\u201d\nA tentative Gryffindor at the back of the class raised a hand. \u201cBut Ha- Professor? Why?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s face darkened, and McGonagall watched with interest. \u201cBecause, Mr. Xin, house prejudices are dangerous things. They are dangerous when we make friends only with people of our own houses, and they are dangerous when we blame problems on people of other houses.\u201d He smiled thinly, \u201cTrust me, I know. We sort early, before we are whole people, and the friends we make in our houses shape who we become, as do the friends we make outside of our houses. There were Death Eaters who, had they been sorted out of Slytherin, would not have become Death Eaters.\u201d\nThere were murmurs of unhappiness from the Slytherins in the classroom and Harry held up a hand. \u201cBut your house does not define you. The most cowardly man I ever knew was a Gryffindor, and I have seen Slytherins do braver things than any Gryffindor. That said, any prejudiced talk from anyone in this classroom will not be tolerated. Prejudice against other houses, prejudice against Muggleborns, prejudice against magical creatures. If I hear it, if I hear of it, there will be swift consequences.\u201d\nThe students looked between each other with little trust, but no one said anything aloud.\n\u201cAnyway, I understand that your magical education in this as in most other subjects has been badly interrupted, but I\u2019m glad that you have at least three years of defense training by now. More than I could say for myself,\u201d Harry said with a grin. \u201cI intend to spend this year with you talking about magical strategy and introduction to dueling. Because I am not sure of your background, we will also briefly cover some of the more advanced magical creatures as well as making sure you have a solid foundation in curses and countercurses.\u201d\nMcGonagall, and Harry apparently, both saw some of the Gryffindors (and even some of the Slytherins) flinch, and Harry looked thoughtful, leaning against his desk. \u201cI know some of you have more experience than you would like with curses, and whether that is casting curses or having them cast on you I don\u2019t particularly care. We will not, in this classroom, under any circumstances, be casting curses on each other. There will be practicals, of course, but we will use magical dummies for that. If anyone at any time feels uncomfortable, you can speak to me during or any time outside of class. I hope this will work for everyone.\u201d\nThere was a general noise of agreement.\n\u201cAll right then,\u201d Harry said, \u201cfirst things first. Basic is good. Rather infamously, my signature spell is Expelliarmus, which I like for a number of reasons\u2026\u201d\nMcGonagall let the magical window into Harry\u2019s classroom fall and sat, resting her chin in her hands for a long silent moment. She wondered how much of that he had practiced beforehand, how much of that Hermione had helped him write, and how much he was prepared for in his class. The questions about him hadn\u2019t started yet, but though they would soon, she felt sure that he was prepared for them.\nShe was glad of him mixing the Slytherins and Gryffindors like that: it was why she had kept the split house classes, always making sure that the rival houses ended up together, but as many speeches as she gave about house unity, there remained a strained resentment even among the staff. And Harry, who had as much reason as anyone to maintain the split, seemed to be trying to mend it. What had happened to the boy convinced that Draco Malfoy was at fault for everything? She supposed he grew up. She was proud of how well he had done.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be good for the school,\u201d a familiar voice commented, grudgingly, from a portrait behind her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever expected to hear you say that, Severus,\u201d McGonagall said.\nThe image of Severus Snape leaned against his portrait frame. Dumbledore, who should have been in the picture next to him, had slipped away again.\nSnape looked down his nose at her, as Slytherin proud as he had ever been in real life, but the next words to come out were distant and aching. \u201cWhat has anger ever gained us?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\niii.\n\nIt was near Halloween, which was always somewhat of a difficult time at a school for young witches and wizards, but Minerva McGonagall was especially regretting her decisions this year.\nHarry was doing well, of course, though as the weather had turned cooler he had broken out some truly hideous jumpers. Letters from Molly confirmed they were hand knitted not only by herself but also by Ginny, Hermione, and Luna Lovegood, which went a long way to explaining some of the more creative color combinations. As a probably intended side effect, the students had mostly lost their awe of him. She\u2019d heard rumors that there was a daily betting pool among some of the seventh years on which sweater he would be wearing each day, but she didn\u2019t personally see anything wrong with a little healthy gambling. Harry also had extra-help hours and had set up an all-ages dueling club that was predictably popular, drawing a good portion of the school together on Thursday evenings. Between him and Flitwick, things ran as smoothly as could be hoped for, with very few visits to the infirmary and no repeats of the disaster of Harry\u2019s own second year. Furthermore, and most impressively, thanks to efforts in his classes, Slytherins and Gryffindors had even reached a wary peace.\nNo, the problem was his godson.\nIt wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t love Teddy Lupin. Everyone loved Teddy Lupin. How could you not? He was a precocious, curious child, and now and again she would watch him for Harry just so she could do advanced transfiguration for him and listen to the hundreds of questions that inevitably followed. However, it was becoming apparent that he took a little too much after his father and his father\u2019s friends. The boy had a penchant for mischief.\nAt first it was endearing: the three year old with a shit-eating grin caught red-handed in the cookie jar, and all that. But he kept finding such new and creative ways to get into trouble that the most McGonagall could hope was that by the time he reached eleven he would simply have exhausted every possible option.\nThe other night he had gotten ahold of his godfather\u2019s invisibility cloak, for example, and disappeared into the castle, prompting a schoolwide search involving most of the professors as well as the Head Boy and Head Girl. Harry had looked very sheepish afterwards and promised to lock the cloak away better, but McGonagall was nevertheless questioning the wisdom of allowing a three year old to stay at the school.\nBut then, the boy loved Harry so much, and Harry looked so happy with him. And the students loved him, of course. There was a regular rotating baby-sitting force of upper years, mostly students who had known Harry during his years at Hogwarts. One or two Slytherins had even quietly volunteered, and McGonagall suspected Harry had taken to mentoring more than one of the students.\nTonight, though.\nNeville had been watching Teddy, which wasn\u2019t at all unusual, while Harry went down to Hogsmeade to meet Ginny for the evening. Except halfway into the evening, Flitwick had come to get McGonagall because somehow Teddy had managed to activate what was apparently a leftover and overlooked trap from the battle, and though he was, thankfully, unharmed, he was stuck the ceiling, and no one was quite sure how to get him down.\nBy all appearances, Teddy was having a great time. When she entered, he called down to her \u201cAunt Minny! I\u2019m flying!\u201d and the smirks on various students\u2019 faces were enough to make her determined to squash that particular nickname, which she suspected Harry of encouraging.\nAt first, McGonagall assumed it was a simple combination of levitation and sticking charms, because that would have been easiest to cast quickly when setting up defenses, but the anti-charms for that didn\u2019t work as easily as they should have. She was hesitant to use a general finite incantatem and end the levitation as well as the sticking charm for fear that Teddy would come crashing down before she could cast a cushioning charm. On the other hand, the magic that held Teddy up felt like a single spell rather than a combination of two.\nIn the end, it took a full twenty minutes and the combined efforts of McGonagall and Flitwick to get him down. While the spell he had activated was deceptively simple, it was slippery, and when Teddy finally came floating down, McGonagall had the uneasy feeling it was because the spell decided to let him go, rather than because of anything they had done.\nNeville took him back gratefully, apologizing profusely and scolding Teddy for playing where he shouldn\u2019t have been. Teddy looked less than remorseful though, and a small part of McGonagall gave it up for a lost cause. When she was sure that Neville was once again in control of Teddy, she left them, walking slowly back to her office and contemplating the spell that had been activated.\nIt was strange because, to start, the castle had told her about the remaining traps. Of course, the castle believed that a little danger and peril was healthy for growing witches and wizards, but after the battle, it had told her the locations of traps. Peeves had gone through the corridors, deactivating them where he could and simply springing them when he couldn\u2019t, so they could be dealt with properly, and she knew they had gone over the corridor where Teddy had been playing at least twice because it was close enough to the Gryffindor tower that there were bound to be students sneaking out past it at all hours.\nIt was possible it was a student prank gone wrong, especially since it seemed mostly harmless, but the magic seemed too advanced and unfamiliar, not the kind of thing they taught at Hogwarts at all. And Teddy himself had seemed to calm, almost like he had been expecting it\u2014but then, perhaps he was just used to living in a household with the remaining Weasley twin.\nAnd yet.\nThe conviction that something wasn\u2019t right only grew as she got closer to her office, as the portraits eyed her, and a painted girl flitted away. Not something dangerous, because the portraits would have told her, but something not as it should be.\nShe spoke the password and stepped onto the stairs but halted them before they began to move. Very faintly she could hear voices. She cast a basic silencing spell on herself and began up the stairs cautiously, waiting to get in hearing range of the voices before she decided how to act.\nAbout halfway up the stairs she began to recognize the voices, and about three quarters of the way up she was able to understand what they were saying.\n\u201c- ever think for just a moment that I had a right to know?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice demanded.\n\u201cHarry,\u201d and that was the quiet, reasonable, infuriating voice of Dumbledore himself.\n\u201cYou sat up here in your high tower, and you organized everything as you saw fit! Did you ever care how anyone else felt about it?\u201d\n\u201cIt was war,\u201d Dumbledore said, old, and defeated, and not as wise as he once had been. \u201cI did what I had to do.\u201d\n\u201cYou thought you were the only one capable of making decisions that effected everyone!\u201d\n\u201cWho else would have stood up to do it?\u201d Dumbledore asked. \u201cWho else but me?\u201d\n\u201cHow many plans?\u201d Harry hissed, so that McGonagall, now just around the last bend of the staircase, could only just hear. \u201cHow many plans and back up plans and back up, back up plans did you have in place so in the end I would walk into that damn forest and die?\u201d\nIt had the sound of something repeated, like this conversation had been going on for a long time before she got here, and she realized, of course, Harry had set the sticking trap himself, probably given his godson a treat for going along with it, so that he could sneak up into her office and talk to Dumbledore\u2019s portrait.\n\u201cHarry, I knew it was the only way.\u201d\n\u201cBullocks!\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou knew nothing! You guessed, and you schemed, and you hoped, and you prayed because you were guilty over something I never had a part in. You raised me like the damn sacrificial lamb, and just think of all the people who had to die for your guess to work out, for me to stand back up and\u2014\u201d\nThere was a pause and then Harry\u2019s voice again. \u201cWe were just children.\u201d\nMcGonagall had heard enough. She had had her own conversation with the portrait of the late chessmaster and knew that nothing came of it\u2014no answers, no closure. Because Dumbledore had given none in life, his portrait, only an imperfect echo of the man that had been, could give none now. She threw off the silencing charm and rounded the corner into her office.\nHarry\u2019s invisibility cloak was in a shimmering heap on the floor, and he stood in the middle of her office, facing the portrait. He was pale and drawn and grim, composed entirely of taught, sharp edges like glass, and etched on his face was deep, unsalved pain and a dark, terrifying hunger for answers no one was left to give him.\nWhen he saw her, he took a step back, unable to hide the emotions on his face.\n\u201cHarry,\u201d she said, and she pulled him into as tight of a hug as she could muster. He stayed tense for a moment, pulling against her, then he collapsed against her and sobbed into her shoulder. She rubbed his back and sat them both down in a chair, letting him shake against her until he was worn out. Over his head, she glared at the portrait of Dumbledore, who quietly disappeared.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d she said, when Harry had calmed down a little, \u201cI think James would have also stuck you to the ceiling as a diversion to sneak into this office. I know Sirius would have. You\u2019re doing a disturbingly admirable job of keeping the legacy alive.\u201d\nHarry laughed wetly into her shoulder, and she smiled down at him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\niv.\n\nThe winter holidays came faster than they should have. It felt like everything came so quickly these days. The seasons changed. Children grew up.\nShe loved the winter holidays; she had since she was a child. The first snowfall of the year and the smell of fresh cut pine and transfiguring decorations for the Great Hall. Working at Hogwarts had only made her appreciate the holidays more as a break from the students and the madness that necessarily attended a magical school.\nTeddy Lupin went home to his grandmother\u2019s, but, while Harry promised Teddy (and Neville, and McGonagall herself) that he would be there for Christmas, he hung back, at first doing work in his office, and then just wandering somewhat aimlessly through the corridors.\nThere weren\u2019t many students that stayed at Hogwarts over the holidays these days. Even going on four years since the end of war, families were reluctant to be separated for longer than they had to. McGonagall still remembered how long it took for the paranoia to die down after the first war. But still, some students stayed: a handful of muggleborns of all ages and houses, and a small group of Slytherins and Ravenclaws that mostly kept to themselves. No one really had to ask more than their last names to find out why.\nMcGonagall wasn\u2019t much surprised that Harry sought them out. Harry seemed to have made it a point to seek out the students who needed guidance and then mentor them as much as they needed or wanted. Part of her worried that he was trying to live up to something, Remus perhaps, or his father, but he seemed happiest when she passed by his office and he had a couple of first years in there, excitedly asking questions about advanced magic, so she let it go.\nA few days into break, wandering absently through the hallways, McGonagall came across an unused classroom emitting the distinct sounds of Exploding Snap and Wizarding Chess. It hardly would have been more than a passing notice, except that she also heard Harry\u2019s voice, \u201cNo, no, look you're leaving your rook completely open to attack like this. Listen, I\u2019m absolute rubbish at teaching chess, you want Ron for that.\u201d\nMcGonagall pushed the door open gently and peered in at the scene in front of her. Harry was sitting cross legged on the floor across a chessboard from a third year Slytherin named Anthony, whose mother had died sometime before the battle of Hogwarts and whose father was now in Azkaban. Leaning against Harry\u2019s side and flipping through a book was a second year Ravenclaw named Amelia, orphaned by the Order.\nThe rest of the group of Slytherins and Ravenclaws was spread out through the room: a seventh year named Henry, standing above Anthony and giving him pointers, a fourth year, Emily, playing Exploding Snap on the floor against a fifth year, Fergus. But also playing Exploding Snap, and getting corrections on the rules from Fergus, was a first year muggleborn named Anabel, and twirling his wand behind her was another muggleborn, Julian. In a corner, a couple muggleborns were teaching three of the Slytherins poker, and trouncing them soundly by the looks of it. In all, McGonagall thought that every student who had stayed behind for holidays was gathered in the room.\n\u201cHeadmistress McGonagall,\u201d Harry said, looking up, glasses askew, \u201cI see you\u2019ve uncovered our secret gaming room. Are you here to give me detention?\u201d A smile flitted around the edges of his mouth as he struggled to keep a straight face.\n\u201cCertainly not, Professor Potter,\u201d McGonagall answered primly. \u201cThough if you think you are teaching chess you\u2019re sorely mistaken. He\u2019ll have you in three moves.\u201d\nHarry looked back at the board, puzzled, and Anthony smirked. \u201cMerlin\u2019s ba- Merlin,\u201d Harry swore, remembering just in time the first and second years in the room. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Well, if you\u2019re not busy, do you want to take over for me?\u201d\nMcGonagall was surprised at the invitation, but really having nothing better to do, she didn\u2019t see any reason to decline. Anthony looked appropriately terrified at the thought of playing chess against the headmistress.\n\u201cGood!\u201d Harry said, standing and brushing himself off. \u201cBecause Nigel,\u201d a sixth year muggleborn in the corner, \u201cis something called a Dungeon Master, and he promised to teach us.\u201d\nMcGonagall raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat is a Dungeon Master?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI have no idea!\u201d Harry said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Nigel is going to teach us.\u201d\nAnthony had backed away from the chessboard and the prospect of playing McGonagall, suddenly finding, she supposed, that whatever Nigel was offering to teach sounded interesting after all. The seventh year, Henry, however, had placed the board on a desk and was silently replacing the pieces. \u201cA game, Professor?\u201d he asked.\nWith a last skeptical look at Harry, McGonagall acquiesced and sat down to play.\nAfter the initial confusion with what Nigel was trying to explain, Dungeons and Dragons proved to be hugely popular among the students who had remained, and, to McGonagall\u2019s knowledge at least, it became a daily meet up. Sometimes she would stop in and play a game of chess with one of the students, including, eventually, Anthony, but as it got closer and closer to Christmas day, she became increasingly worried that Harry wasn\u2019t going home.\nWhen she confronted him about it, however, two days before Christmas Eve, he just looked vaguely self-satisfied.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a change of plans,\u201d he said, evasively. \u201cI\u2019m just working out some details.\u201d\n\u201cDetails on what, Mr. Potter?\u201d McGonagall asked, using her best headmistress voice.\nA pause stretched out while Harry tried and failed to keep from looking smug. \u201cTransportation.\u201d\n\u201cTo where? If I may ask.\u201d\n\u201cGodric\u2019s hollow,\u201d Harry admitted. \u201cAndromeda, Teddy, and everyone are going to meet us there. At my parent\u2019s house.\u201d\nMcGonagall waited for more details, which, after a moment, Harry volunteered. \u201cI invited all the students who were staying here for the holidays. Hogwarts is great and all but, well it\u2019s not the same as having a family for Christmas. And it seemed a shame to interrupt our D&amp;D sessions.\u201d\n\u00a0She was thoughtful for a moment before asking, \u201cIsn\u2019t a portkey the obvious solution?\u201d\nHarry shrugged, \u201cYes, well, some of the muggleborn parents are understandably a little concerned at their children taking magical transportation like that, and Nigel himself is terrified of them, something about the Star Trek transporter problem. So while a portkey will do it for most of them, I\u2019m just working out some last minute details for the rest.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said after a long moment, \u201cI might be persuaded to let you borrow some of the school brooms. Provided, of course,\u201d she said, giving him a pointed look, \u201cyounger students are accompanied by older more experienced flyers.\u201d\nHarry grinned, \u201cCan\u2019t be more dangerous than flying thestrals to invade the Ministry, can it?\u201d\n\u201cIf that is the reference you insist on measuring things against, I\u2019m afraid we may have a professional disagreement on the meaning of danger.\u201d Harry laughed and McGonagall added archly, \u201cAnd I, Mr. Potter, outrank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nv.\n\nIt was a Saturday in late February when second term was already well under way. Outside, the wind howled and drove the stinging sleet into a steady assault against the castle windows. The castle itself was sulking at the weather; four separate groups of first years had had to be rescued after the moving staircases deposited them in the wrong part of the castle, and a fourth year who had wandered down one corridor had found herself somehow on an entirely different floor.\nMcGonagall, leaving other professors to deal with these matters, was sequestered in her office with a cheerful wood fire that flickered in different bright colors. A pot of tea sat mostly empty on a small, antique table rescued from the Room of Lost Things and several high backed arm chairs sat pushed around it. McGonagall sat facing the fire, holding a warm cup of tea, milk but no sugar. Luna Lovegood, responsible for the colorful fire, sat on the hearth, her chair having been commandeered by Crookshanks. Hermione sat in the chair beside Crookshanks as she told McGonagall about recent developments in the DMLE\u2019s ongoing pursuit to root out the very last remnants of Death Eater sentiment, and the necessity of coordinating with the French and Romanian muggle governments.\nRon sat across from Hermione and looked at with her with a mixture of pride and fondness. McGonagall had attempted to interrogate him earlier on some of the new products appearing in his brother\u2019s joke store, but Ron had refused to tell her anything, with an expression that was strongly reminiscent of Fred.\nGinny, wearing a home knit sweater in the Holyhead Harpies colors, was perched on the arm of Harry\u2019s chair and kept stealing biscuits when she thought no one was looking. Harry himself was preoccupied by a game of Exploding Snap with Neville.\n\u201cThe Prime Minister of Romania,\u201d Hermione said, \u201chas an uncle who is a wizard, actually, but apparently no one got around to telling the current president about the existence of magic, so that\u2019s giving us quite a bit of trouble. We know for a fact that there\u2019s a group of at least five Death Eaters holed up in Bucharest, but we can\u2019t get at them.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get them,\u201d Ron said, reaching out and putting a hand on her knee. \u201cIt\u2019s just bureaucracy.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s S.P.E.W. going?\u201d Neville asked, without looking up from his game with Harry.\nThe tips of Hermione\u2019s ears colored slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s not called that anymore,\u201d she said, sourly.\n\u201cYeah, but how\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I did manage to convince Regulation and Control to draft a protection act. It\u2019s not emancipation, but it\u2019s regulation and that\u2019s a start.\u201d Hermione looked bitter. \u201cViolent punishments are limited for one. And using magic on them.\u201d\n\u201cNot just leaving random socks hidden all around Britain?\u201d Harry asked. Hermione scowled at him.\nThe gathering in McGonagall\u2019s office was something of an accident. Harry and Neville had come up to discuss a joint lesson about dangerous plants, and Ginny had tagged along because she was staying with Harry for the week. McGonagall had invited them to stay for a spot of tea, and somehow the others had ended up being invited by floo and coming in.\n\u201cSo, do you think you\u2019ll keep Harry on another year?\u201d Ginny asked McGonagall, suddenly. \u201cOr is he sacked for being a terrible influence.\u201d\n\u201cI think Harry can stay,\u201d McGonagall answered. \u201cAlthough it was looking somewhat iffy a couple weeks ago when two second years managed to hex each other three separate times in the same class.\u201d\nHarry shrugged. \u201cTo be fair, Angela\u2019s mother\u2019s hearing got pushed up, so she was having a rough week.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the excuse for Mr. Fraser?\u201d\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s just a little git. Anyway, you know I docked points and gave both of them detention.\u201d\nNeville laughed. \u201cHarry, detention with you usually means chocolate and a chance to ask questions about the war. Students try to get detention with you.\u201d\nHarry was unrepentant. \u201cAt least the questions I get in class have died down to only ones that are relevant to the lesson. Unforgiveable curses with the fourth years was rough, but I got through it.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t demonstrate on a spider, did you?\u201d Hermione asked.\n\u201cHermione, you helped me write the lesson plans.\u201d\n\u201cRight, but since when have you ever stuck to plan?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Harry is an excellent teacher,\u201d Luna said, as the fire flared up in Ravenclaw colors. \u201cI was thinking the Quibbler might publish an expos\u00e9 on the hero\u2019s life after his return to Hogwarts. Lots of student interviews.\u201d\nMcGonagall frowned, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to get parent permission to publish that.\u201d\n\u201cSkeeter never does,\u201d Neville said. \u201cDid you see the Hogwarts\u2019 Heartthrobs piece she published last week?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous because Harry beat you out for number of student crushes,\u201d Ron said.\n\u201cHarry can have them,\u201d Neville said. \u201cI got no less than seven different bouquets for Valentines, all signed my secret admirer. Although there were some very interesting rare flowers in them that I have no idea how a student got a hold of.\u201d\n\u201cIs it becoming a problem?\u201d McGonagall asked. \u201cWe can do something about it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, two of the bouquets were me,\u201d Luna said. \u201cSorry, I thought you would recognize them, Neville.\u201d\nNeville\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cWhere on earth did you find the Venetian hummer? All the texts say they\u2019ve gone extinct.\u201d\n\u201cI have several growing in my garden,\u201d Luna answered.\n\u201cLuna!\u201d\nMcGonagall let the conversation wash over her. Here, she had gathered the heroes of the Wizarding World, and they almost sounded like normal young adults.\n\u201cWho is your least favorite student?\u201d Ginny asked Harry, a note of mischief in her voice, breaking into McGonagall\u2019s thoughts.\nHarry looked at her, \u201cI can\u2019t answer that!\u201d\n\u201cProfessor McGonagall, will Harry get sacked if he answers my question?\u201d Ginny asked.\nMcGonagall suppressed a smile, privately interested in the answer herself. \u201cI promise I will not sack Harry for answering your question.\u201d\n\u201cSee? Now you have to answer the question,\u201d Ginny said, triumphantly.\nHarry huffed. \u201cNo, I just. I can\u2019t answer that. It\u2019s unfair.\u201d\n\u201cThen your least favorite thing about teaching.\u201d\nHarry looked thoughtful now. \u201cI don\u2019t mind the questions, usually. Everyone wants to know, I get that, but sometimes. It happens mostly with the second and third years. The first years are too scared to ask questions, although that\u2019s changing. But a lot of the second and third years, especially the muggleborns, feel cheated out of an adventure, and then they want to know everything. Sometimes they can get a little personal.\u201d Harry grinned then. \u201cOh, and grading homework is almost as bad as having to do it.\u201d\nMcGonagall narrowed her eyes, \u201cI had noticed an unusually low level of essays required for your class.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m teaching practical magic, Professor, not theory,\u201d he answered.\n\u201cProfessor Sprout had me grading essays comparing and contrasting muggle and magical Venus fly traps,\u201d Neville said. \u201cI thought I would gouge my eyes out before the end of it.\u201d Neville\u2019s expression changed to rueful. \u201cI love the first years, actually. I had a first year come to me the other day. She\u2019d been in class all year and hadn\u2019t said a word, and then she came up to me, and I expected a question about the war or something, but she said very quietly, is it true that there are merpeople in the lake, and she read that gillyweed would let her talk to them.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Longbottom, if you have given a first year girl gillyweed I can personally guarantee that you will never become a professor at Hogwarts,\u201d McGonagall said.\n\u201cIs that really any worse than buying a first year a broom?\u201d Harry asked.\n\u201cThat,\u201d McGonagall answered, \u201cwas for Quidditch and is an entirely different matter.\u201d\nGinny seconded the idea while Hermione professed to still completely fail to understand the appeal of the sport. A familiar argument broke out in response to that, and McGonagall let them continue, secure and content in a tower of Hogwarts, high above the rest of the world.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nvi.\n\nMcGonagall looked at the student fidgeting on the other side of the desk. She sighed. One day, she swore, she was going to retire. One day soon. The next time something like this happened she was going to quit Hogwarts entirely, move to someplace warm, and spend the rest of her life drinking colorful drinks with little umbrellas stuck in them.\nThe student was a seventh year Hufflepuff girl and, really, you would think seventh years would know better than to try stuff like this. You would think Hufflepuffs would know better than to try stuff like this.\nWasn\u2019t there supposed to be an all magical island somewhere near Puerto Rico?\n\u201cMiss Junipers, has Professor Potter told you why you are here?\u201d McGonagall asked.\nCalypso Junipers was a pretty girl with long dark hair braided down her back, big brown eyes, and a round face that broadcast every thought that crossed her mind. While she was a good student and universally well liked, her reputation as a bit of a ditz was strong enough to have reached even McGonagall. In response to the question, she shook her head while wearing absolutely the guiltiest look McGonagall had ever seen on a student. Harry, sitting beside her, rolled his eyes, which McGonagall pretended not to notice.\nMcGonagall tapped the phial that stood on her desk with her wand. \u201cYou may not be aware of this, but Professor Potter has very good relations with all the house elves in the castle, especially a particularly malicious old one named Kreacher.\u201d\nHarry looked prepared to object to that description of Kreacher, but apparently thought better of it.\n\u201cThis morning, Kreacher informed him that a Hufflepuff student had slipped into the kitchen and attempted to bribe the house elves to slip this into his drink. Professor Potter recognized it as a love potion and brought the matter to my attention. Does any of this sound familiar to you?\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me Professor!\u201d Calypso protested. \u201cI\u2019m rubbish at potions!\u201d\nMcGonagall peered at her over her square glasses. \u201cMiss Junipers, love potions can be bought. This one originates from an order service called Madame Monette\u2019s Amorous Solutions.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never even heard of that!\u201d\nThis was a particularly bald-faced lie. Madame Monette\u2019s put out a monthly newsletter with romance tips, gossip, and a wizard of the month. They also had a daily horoscope subscription. Both of these had gained something of a cult following among the older students in the recent months, made obnoxious by the influx of perfumed pale pink envelopes every morning that fluttered neatly down to the subscribers. Even Professor Slughorn had a subscription, although what for was anyone\u2019s guess.\n\u201cAdditionally,\u201d McGonagall informed Calypso, \u201cit is entirely possible to determine who a love potion is intended to make the target fall in love with, without having to actually drink it.\u201d\nCalypso looked panicked, aware that she was well and truly caught in the act.\n\u201cPlease explain yourself.\u201d\nCalypso\u2019s mouth worked for a moment as she tried and failed to come up with a suitable excuse. At last she turned to Harry, \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry Professor! It was\u2014well someone sneaked some firewhiskey into the Hufflepuff common room for Andrea\u2019s birthday, and things got a little out of a hand, and it was a dare, and I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid your fate isn\u2019t in my hands,\u201d Harry said, but McGonagall caught the corner of his lip twitching.\n\u201cDo you understand how serious an offense this is?\u201d McGonagall asked, severely.\nCalypso turned back to the headmistress, tears brimming in her eyes.\n\u201cYou could be, reasonably, expelled for this and even get in trouble with the ministry.\u201d\nCalypso shrieked. \u201cNo! I want to be a healer at St. Mungo\u2019s! If I get a record, they\u2019ll never take me!\u201d she wailed.\n\u201cYou might have thought that before attempting such a foolish thing.\u201d\n\u201cAre you really going to tell the ministry? Will they even let me take my N.E.W.T.s after this?\u201d\nHarry was doing a rather poor job at this point of suppressing his amusement. McGonagall shot a glare at him and then returned to the distressed Hufflepuff in front of her. \u201cMiss Junipers, you are very lucky in that Professor Potter has requested that we be lenient on you, given that in your years at Hogwarts this has been your first offense.\u201d\nCalypso gasped and looked at Harry with something akin to worship. McGonagall hoped Harry saw that and kept his guard up around this one.\n\u201cNevertheless, fifty points will be taken from Hufflepuff for this, and you will have Saturday detentions for the next month.\u201d\n\u201cWith Professor Potter?\u201d Calypso asked hopefully.\n\u201cNo, Miss Junipers. With Professor Slughorn.\u201d They could discuss their Madam Monette\u2019s subscriptions together.\nCalypso visibly deflated. \u201cYes, Professor.\u201d\n\u201cYou may go now.\u201d\nCalypso got up and left with a last longing glance at the love potion and then at Harry. Somehow, Harry managed to keep it together just long enough for her to close the door and begin her descent down the spiral staircase, but as soon as she was out of earshot he burst out laughing.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly funny,\u201d McGonagall said. \u201cIf Kreacher hadn\u2019t told you.\u201d\nHarry waved his hand. \u201cBit of well-founded paranoia: I always check my drinks first. I would have been fine. Besides, Ginny\u2019s well stocked on antidotes to love potions.\u201d\n\u201cBut the principle of the thing remains. We can\u2019t have students attempting to dose you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, we can\u2019t,\u201d Harry said, sobering. \u201cBut I\u2019m only a few years older than some of these students, and I am the hero of the wizarding world.\u201d\n\u201cAs always, glad to see it hasn\u2019t gone to your head, Potter,\u201d Snape\u2019s portrait muttered from the wall. Phineas Black sniggered, but McGonagall and Harry ignored both of them.\n\u201cI mean,\u201d Harry said, \u201cThat I\u2019m sure it will blow over within a few years, and until then I have the entire fleet of house elves on my side.\u201d\nMcGonagall picked up the phial of love potion, looking over it thoughtfully. \u201cI really don\u2019t know why they still allow these.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re headmistress.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been banned at Hogwarts for forty years,\u201d she said. \u201cI just meant more generally.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well, when has the wizarding world ever been progressive on anything?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m considering banning Madame Monette\u2019s altogether.\u201d\nHarry snorted. \u201cReplace all their subscriptions with Quibbler subscriptions. Luna would be able to afford another trip to Laos to search for\u2014what was in Laos?\u201d\n\u201cSome sort of dragon, I believe. Charlie Weasley turned her onto it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything you can do to stop the girls from falling all over you?\u201d McGonagall asked, half ironically.\n\u201cWhy do you think I wear all the ridiculous sweaters?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind if they were just quiet about it like they are with Neville.\u201d He got a sudden thoughtful look. \u201cI could have Ginny threaten to hex them all.\u201d\nMcGonagall smiled at the image of an enraged Ginevra Weasley threatening terrified students. After all, half them held Ginny in just as much awe as they did Harry, if not without more envy.\nShe set the love potion down on her desk and, with a wave of her wand, vanished it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nvii.\n\nThe end of second term came in a rush of warm days and golden light slanting through the Hogwarts windows. There was the usual amount of stress among the students. One Ravenclaw studying for their N.E.W.T.s disappeared deep into the library, only to be found two days later with a long beard, babbling about an orangutan. A Gryffindor and a Slytherin were caught in a cheating scandal by Professor Binns and threatened with expulsion, but ultimately let off with a warning when the Slytherin reasoned that, while they had been intending to cheat, they hadn\u2019t actually cheated and therefore had, technically, done nothing wrong. Meanwhile, a Hufflepuff declared all exams a farce and took up a brief but eventful residence in the kitchens with the house elves and wasn\u2019t ousted until McGonagall herself went to the kitchen to tell her that if she wanted to protest exams she could do it perfectly well from her own common room.\nDespite looming exams, longing for summer and an end to classes was almost universally tempered by the ban on underage magic. Out by the lake, some sixth years who were not yet of age took out their frustration by competing to see who could make the biggest explosion over the water, until the giant squid flicked a tentacle in their direction in warning.\nThe winter holiday\u2019s D&amp;D group held out right to the last day of classes before exams, which McGonagall knew because she had scheduled a meeting with Harry for that evening, and he showed up fifteen minutes late, apologizing profusely because they had reached a very climactic point where Anthony and Julian\u2019s characters had confronted each other and realized they were secretly long lost brothers, separated by war and family rifts. One of the portraits on the wall, who had been getting updates on the campaign from another portrait, gasped in shock, but a glance from McGonagall silenced him.\n\u00a0\u201cAre you looking forward to summer holidays, Professor Potter?\u201d she asked.\nHe grinned, \u201cYeah, Andromeda agreed to let Teddy get a broom that flies more than a foot off the ground so Ginny and I are going to teach him Quidditch. Then for my birthday Luna has promised some sort of surprise, and I have no idea what it is but knowing her it will be worth it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your gaming group?\u201d\nHarry waved a hand dismissively. \u201cWorked that out ago months ago.\u201d He rattled off a list of who was going where and finished up by saying, \u201cEveryone is going somewhere where they are happy, and they have all promised to write.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then you seem to have everything quite under control.\u201d McGonagall said. \u201cSo, the reason I have asked you here.\u201d\nHarry sat down in the chair in front of McGonagall\u2019s desk. \u201cI\u2019m not getting the sack, am I?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cJust checking.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cI just want to ask you how you are.\u201d\n\u201cIf this is a \u2018check on Harry, make sure he\u2019s okay\u2019 talk, I get those weekly from Andromeda and daily from Molly,\u201d he warned.\n\u201cAs your employer,\u201d McGonagall said, \u201cand as your friend, I want to ask how you are and whether working at Hogwarts has done what you hoped.\u201d\nHarry went quiet for a long moment, looking out a window across the grounds of Hogwarts where the last, long rays of the sunset reflected off the lake. Distantly, Dumbledore\u2019s tomb gleamed white and gold.\nHarry looked much the same as he had a year ago when McGonagall hired him, except that he wore wizarding robes today rather than muggle clothes. The last remnants of long grief had fallen from his face over the course of the year, and he smiled often now. The golden light caught in his eyes, giving him an unearthly look for a moment, phoenix-like. A flock of birds took flight over the Forbidden Forest, and Harry looked back to Professor McGonagall.\n\u201cThe real reason I made the Gryffindors mix with the Slytherins in my class was because I don\u2019t care anymore what side of the war your parents were on. I just don\u2019t want any more kids to die.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair.\n\u201cAnyway, Meredith Burke and Allison Montague have a summer trip to France planned together. They\u2019re doing half wizarding things and half muggle things. In the dueling club, two third years showed up last month and were able to pull off fully formed, if somewhat shaky, Patronuses. Henry, who comes from a mix of about twelve different pureblood families, is spending a couple weeks with Nigel\u2019s family this summer.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but Harry,\u201d McGonagall interrupted, \u201chow are you?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these kids, I did that. I made that possible. So you have Gryffindors spending their summers with Slytherins, and purebloods staying at muggle homes, and what it all means is\u2014\u201d He paused and took a breath, trying vainly to flatten his hair back out.\nHe looked at her, his eyes greener and more piercing than ever. \u201cThe war is actually, finally over. Properly. And I\u2019m not off running away across the world anymore. I\u2019m here. With a job to do. Where it began, and where it ended, and it did end. It really is over.\u201d He laughed,\u00a0a slight sound of overdue relief.\nMcGonagall understood. \u201cGood.\u201d They looked at each other across the desk for a long breath, and then she said, \u201cI expect any edits to your curriculum for next year by mid-July please. That\u2019s all then. Go finish preparing your exam, Potter,\u201d she said.\nHarry stood, but waited a moment before leaving. He leaned down and put a hand over McGonagall\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever said thank you, Professor.\"\nShe smiled at him. \u201cYou never had to.\u201d\nHe walked out and let the door fall to behind him. There were murmurings from the headmasters on the walls.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good boy,\u201d a plump old witch said. \u201cI\u2019ve always said so.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s too young to be a professor,\u201d Phineas Black complained. \u201cHe\u2019s too soft on the students.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done well by him, Minerva,\u201d Dumbledore\u2019s portrait said softly, almost regretfully.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s done well by all of us,\u201d she answered.\nShe watched the door for a while, thinking, and then said, \u201cHe\u2019s right, isn\u2019t he? The war is over for good this time. There\u2019s no last minute plot to revive Voldemort, there\u2019s no new Dark Lord, no secret heir?\u201d\nDumbledore\u2019s painted eyes twinkled in that strange, disarming way. \u201cNo. When Harry defeated Voldemort four years ago, he defeated him for good, with a magic older and stronger than anything Voldemort ever wielded. I cannot tell you if another dark wizard will rise to power; there will always be those who seek to rule over other men and be called lord, but I think if they come they will not find it as easy to gain power as they once did.\u201d Dumbledore smiled. \u201cHarry is healing very old wounds.\u201d\n\u201cHe gets to be happy now,\u201d McGonagall said. \u201cHe deserves that.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore\u2019s portrait.\n\u00a0\nExams came and Harry\u2019s, modeled on Remus\u2019s from years ago, went off without a mishap, which even Harry seemed a little surprised at. McGonagall overheard him commenting cheerfully to Nearly Headless Nick that he had expected at least one second year\u2019s hex to go wild and hit someone instead of the target. He was pleased to say however, that the closest they had come was a Twitchy Ear hex that caught a portrait. The portrait in question swore bloody vengeance on the second year but was ultimately unharmed.\nIn a surprise upset, Hufflepuff won the House Cup with Gryffindor and Slytherin tying for second and Ravenclaw, which had been winning, coming in last, having lost all but fifty of their points for an incident involving no less than twelve different products from Weasleys\u2019 Wizard Wheezes and several seventh years\u2019 speculation on what it would take to lose all of the house points they had won over the course of the year.\nAs Harry left his seat at the High Table after the feast, he leaned over to McGonagall to say, \u201cIt\u2019s strange for the end of the year to come without having to fight any evil.\u201d\nDorms were emptied with the usual house elf efficiency, and students were packed away to the Hogwarts Express and the return London. McGonagall watched them go, until the castle was left, echoing and hollow. Something far away shifted as the castle settled in for the long summer months.\nHarry came up beside her. His own trunk was being brought down to Hogsmeade, and all he had with him was a beat-up muggle backpack and his wand sticking out of his back pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll see you next September, Professor,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHave a good summer, Harry.\u201d\nShe watched him walk down across the Hogwarts grounds to Hogsmeade under the bright June sun. McGonagall smiled.\nAll was well."
