    "notes": "<p>Hey guys! Sorry I haven't updated this in literally forever. You can blame a combination of Thomas Astruc for mistreating my characters and My Hero Academia for becoming my most recent hyper-fixation. But! Apparently somebody popular on tumblr reblogged something of mine and the third chapter got like 50 likes within the past 24 hours, so I was, welp, I guess people still like this story, so... here you go! Comments and Kudos, kids, they save stories. <br>In other news, I created an outline! I don't know how many chapters it's gonna be, but I do know what's gonna happen. I'm not gonna tell you guys when I'll update because then I'll feel even more guilty if I fall off the face of the earth again, but I'm glad you're all as excited to read this story as I am to write it.</p>\n<p>So, I wasn't planning on publishing this chapter for another few days, but I've written a little bit ahead and am loving reading your reactions, so... yeah! You get it early! <br>Ok, disclaimer, I know nothing about the legal systems in France and I wasn't able to find much in 30 seconds of googling, so I just based some of these on laws where I live. Sorry if it's not completely accurate, but this is just a fic and we are not bound by the laws of reality here, so deal with it. Thank you!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Happy New Years everyone! I went to a really cool fantasy theme park near my home last night and I even won a raffle for like the first time in my life. It was awesome, but cold. Really cold.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Do you guys know how hard it is to come up with themed lemonade puns every chapter? I am not naturally good at puns and, unlike cat puns, there's not just a website you can go to and get unlimited puns. Every chapter, I kick myself for making that decision, but then sigh and realize that I still love my silly punny titles.</p>\n<p>Thanks for all the pun resources, guys! Y'all are amazing!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_9_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Hey guys! I didn't disappear for months this time!<br>That being said, I thought I'd share <a rel=\"nofollow\"> my tumblr! </a></p>\n<p>This fic is not abandoned, it's just that I've largely fallen out of the fandom at this point, so I only work on it when I'm in an ml mood, which doesn't happen as often as it used to. I'm sorry for making everyone wait, and I'll do my best to finish this story before this most recent mood dissipates.</p>\n<p>Wow, look at that! I'm not dead!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_16_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>This fic has been so fun to write. My life has completely changed since I started writing it. I hope you like the ending and I'm grateful for everyone who has stuck with this little story through inconsistent updates and me leaving the fandom. I knew that I didn't want to abandon this one, my first multi-chapter fic, and it feel so good to know that it is done. <br>Thank you for reading and have a wonderful time reading all the amazing stories out there in this fandom.</p>",
    "text": "Marinette ran out of the classroom holding back tears and sat on the dirty hall floor with her knees pulled into her chest. She looked at her watch, a fancy new digital one that showed the time down to the millisecond and rummaged in her school bag until she found the repurposed sketchbook and created a new entry.\nThen she waited.\nIt wasn\u2019t long until she saw the familiar black butterfly. She wrote something else before closing her eyes and taking a deep breath. Enough practice had made it easy for her to slow her breathing and let her emotions fade. When Marinette opened her eyes again, the akuma was fluttering indecisively centimeters from her face. She swallowed her fear, then took another deep breath and exhaled, blowing the akuma away from her. The butterfly hesitated for another long second before it flew away down the hall.\nMarinette picked up her sketchbook again, writing one last thing before glancing at Tikki, who had left the girl\u2019s bag in favor of her shoulder since there was no one else in the hall. The kwami was looking at her holder with a mixture of concern and pride. They both looked at the list in Marinette\u2019s sketchbook, the neat lines and columns filling the page and nodded to each other. Marinette smiled.\nThey had enough.\nMiss Bustier had asked Marinette to leave class for \u201cbeing a disturbance\u201d or at least that was what Lila said Marinette had been doing when the teacher returned to the classroom with a stack of copies. Her class, her \u201cfriends\u201d, had sided with the liar rather than seeing that Lila had clearly picked the fight, so it was Marinette who had to endure the punishment. \u00a0\nMarinette waited until the bell rang to go back into the classroom only to see that Lila had immediately glued herself to Adrien\u2019s side. Ever since Lila had gotten the official Gabriel Agreste seal of approval to be Adrien\u2019s friend, she had made good on her promise to make sure Marinette couldn\u2019t get near the model. As far as Marinette knew, Lila still hadn\u2019t had any luck in getting Adrien to believe her lies, but the boy couldn\u2019t avoid her without getting in trouble with his father.\nAdrien caught Marinette\u2019s eye and gave her a look, are you okay? Marinette responded by rolling her eyes and shrugged, not really, but whatever. They mostly communicated with looks these days, since that was all that Lila couldn\u2019t manipulate. It had surprised Marinette how easy it was to read Adrien\u2019s body language, even when they were across the room and he didn\u2019t seem to have any problems reading hers. It was actually easier to communicate with him this way, since she didn\u2019t have to worry about tripping over her words.\nHer seat in physics was near the front, right beside Alya. Mrs. Mendeleev asked a question that she didn\u2019t know the answer to and Adrien\u2019s hand shot up in front of her.\n\u201cFifteen meters per second.\u201d\n\u201cCorrect Adrien\u201d\nMarinette needed Adrien\u2019s help for the next step in her plan. He was good at math, which Marinette decidedly was not, and he was one of the only people who knew that Lila was liar, which meant that he was one of the only people who Marinette could trust. Marinette hestitated a moment before texting her crush. She was getting better at not embarrassing herself around him, but it was still admittedly a work in progress.\n\nMarinette: You\u2019re good at mathy stuff, right?\n\nSmooth Marinette, she thought, Great job not sounding like an idiot.\nAdrien shuffled in his seat, pulling his phone of his back pocket and tucking it under the desk as he read her text. He glanced back at Marinette in confusion, then started typing.\n\nAdrien: Yeah, why?\n\nThis was the difficult part. Her plan was dangerous and too tied up with her Ladybug side so Adrien might be in danger if he really knew what she was trying to do. She texted him her cover story instead.\n\nMarinette: I have this extra credit project in math, but it\u2019s a little above my skill level and I\u2019d really appreciate your help on it. \n\nThat sounded normal enough, right? Nothing earth shattering, nothing that suggested that Paris\u2019s safety could hang in the balance. Just extra credit.\nAdrien once again had his phone under his desk and was typing.\n\nAdrien: Sure, if I can get away from Lila long enough. Meet me in the library after school?\n\nHe glanced back at her as she read his text, giving her a grimace before turning back to the front and pretending to pay attention to the teacher. Or maybe he wasn\u2019t pretending, it was hard to tell.\nMarinette frowned. The library was too public. There was no guarantee that anyone listening wouldn\u2019t be able to figure out what she was planning. She took a deep breath to work up her courage.\n\nMarinette: Actually, can we meet at my house?\n\nThe akuma attack that afternoon was actually a blessing, Adrien thought as he bounded up the stairs towards Marinette\u2019s room. He had taken advantage of the standard after-attack chaos to text his bodyguard saying he was spending the afternoon doing homework with a friend. His father would assume he meant Lila and no one would think to check until that evening.\nMarinette was already waiting for him when he burst through though the trapdoor of her room.\n\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d Adrien puffed, \u201cAkuma.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cProblem no! I mean, no problem,\u201d Marinette seemed a little out of breath as well, \u201cI-I just got back.\u201d\nThey stood awkwardly for a moment before Adrien broke the silence, \u201cSo\u2026extra credit?\u201d\nMarinette jumped, \u201cYeah!\u201d She ran over to her desk and Adrien pulled up a chair to sit next to her. She pulled out a sketch book and opened it to a messily drawn table. Adrien read the headers: offense, arrived, location. There were times written in the first two columns and then a location in Paris in the third. Adrien also noticed that some lines were crossed out while a few had notes scrawled in the margins.\n\u201cVery impressive,\u201d Adrien remarked honestly making Marinette blushed. \u201cWhat are we going to do with it?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Marinette hesitated, \u201cI-I, uh, was wondering, well, if it\u2019d be possible, but if it\u2019s not then I guess it\u2019s not a problem. Ugh! I\u2019m such an idiot, this was a bad idea.\u201d That last part was to herself. Adrien put his hands on her shoulders.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Marinette, I get it. It looks like you collected all this data yourself, so I\u2019m guessing this is kind of a self-designed extra credit project?\u201d Marinette looked relieved and nodded, \u201cSo if the teacher doesn\u2019t have anything specific that he wants you to do, what do you want to find out from this data? I mean, you wouldn\u2019t have gone through the trouble of collecting it if you didn\u2019t have something in mind\u2026\u201d\nMarinette seemed to calm down a little at that and squared her shoulders. She looked at the list rather than at Adrien and took a deep breath, \u201cI want to try and find a location. If\u2026 something\u2026left around the time in the offense column and arrived at the written location at the time in the arrived column, can we find out where these things are coming from?\u201d Marinette risked an insecure glance at Adrien, clearly unsure if this was even possible.\nFor his part, Adrien thought it was an odd choice for an extra credit project, but his mind had already taken a running start, \u201cIt should be, as long as we know about how fast these things travel,\u201d he was starting to get excited and couldn\u2019t keep a grin off his face, \u201cYou chose a really interesting project Marinette!\u201d Adrien looked around, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have a map, would you? I think it\u2019ll make things easier if we can visualize it.\u201d\nMarinette tried jumping up out of her seat but ended up tangled up with the chair as it fell to the floor. \u201cI\u2019m ok!\u201d She yelped, untangling herself from the chair and running to the corner of her room before Adrien could try to help her. She came back with a massive roll wrapped in cellophane. Adrien laughed as she unwrapped the map and spread it out on the floor.\n\u201cYou\u2019re always prepared, aren\u2019t you Marinette?\u201d The girl gave him a shy smile before grabbing a sheet of stickers from one of the desk drawers and turning her attention back toward the map. Adrien was already putting books at each of the corners so it would lie flat.\n\u201cI was thinking we could start by putting a sticker at each location I have written down, that will at least give us an idea of the general area we\u2019re working with, right?\u201d\nAdrien nodded, \u201cGood idea. I\u2019m assuming that we can ignore the locations you\u2019ve crossed off on your list. Those are incomplete data, right?\u201d\nMarinette nodded and handed Adrien a sheet of stickers. Adrien found it easy to work with her and it wasn\u2019t long before they sat back to admire their handiwork. There were around thirty stickers spread out over Paris, although many seemed to be concentrated around their school. Adrien looked up the formulas he needed on his phone and they got to work on their calculations.\nBy the time that Adrien had explained the basic math to Marinette, she was feeling more confident and was starting to lose herself in the flow of the project. Adrien watched her plug the numbers into the formula he\u2019d shown her and grinned as she started muttering to herself, oblivious to everything besides the problem in front of her.\n\u201c\u2026so, if I was at the Eiffel Tower\u2026 that 11:35\u2026and factoring in how fast the average akuma flies\u2026\u201d\nAdrien felt his smile melt. Akumas? He took a closer look at the list in Marinette\u2019s sketchbook. Sure enough, the writing in the margins were names of various akumas that he and Ladybug had fought in the last few months. How was she collecting this data?\nMarinette had finished her calculation by this point and was watching Adrien in concern.\n\u201cAdrien, are you ok? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to find Hawkmoth.\u201d\nAdrien felt numb. Marinette went pale and her mouth worked as she tried to come up with something to say.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s dangerous. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to tell you what I was doing\u2026I didn\u2019t want you involved any more than necessary.\u201d\nAdrien laughed to himself. Too bad Marinette didn\u2019t know how deeply Chat Noir was already involved in the fight against Hawkmoth. If anything, he was more concerned with how deeply this involved Marinette. After all, she didn\u2019t have superpowers to protect her like he did.\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Adrien was still trying to wrap his head around the situation, \u201cThis list, you\u2019ve been keeping track of the akumas?\u201d\n\u201cPotential akumas,\u201d Marinette corrected, \u201cI payed attention to situations around me that had the potential for strong emotions and then stuck around to see if a villain appeared. The crossed-out lines mean that no akuma ever showed up, even though there was strong negative emotion.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the lines without a name written by them?\u201d\nMarinette froze and Adrien waited. Finally, she screwed her eyes closed and:\n\u201cThose were ones that came after me.\u201d\nAdrien\u2019s stomach dropped and he felt his ears start to ring. There were dozens of unlabeled entries. What was going on with Marinette?\n\u201cIt\u2019s Lila,\u201d Marinette refused to look him in the eye, \u201cI didn\u2019t saw anything because, well, you\u2019ve got enough problems with her without adding mine to the mix and I didn\u2019t want you to worry, and I know that it\u2019s best for her lies to just self-destruct because I really wasn\u2019t getting anywhere trying to call her out, but she threatened me in the bathroom and said she\u2019d turn all my friends against me and I thought that if I stopped trying to call her out, then she wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything, but that didn\u2019t work and I\u2019m pretty sure Alya hates me now, not to mention the rest of the class, and she\u2019s always hanging off you even though it\u2019s obvious that you hate it and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhoa Marinette, slow down! Did you just say that she threatened you?\u201d\nSometime while she\u2019d been taking, Marinette had crossed her arms in front of her chest and had started to look very small. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have told you that. I don\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d\n\u201cWell too bad, Marinette, I\u2019m your friend, that means it\u2019s my job to worry about you. I didn\u2019t know that things with Lila had gotten so bad.\u201d\nMarinette shrugged, \u201cIf I can find Hawkmoth, it\u2019s all worth it. I\u2019ve gotten really good at breathing exercises so I can calm down quickly, and if Lila\u2019s going to make my life miserable anyway, I may as well make the best of it.\u201d\nAdrien stared at her with wide eyes, \u201cYou\u2019re amazing Marinette.\u201d\nShe blushed again before a determined glint appeared in her eyes and she smiled, \u201cLet\u2019s find ourselves a terrorist.\u201d\nThey worked in silence the rest of the time, Marinette occasionally calling Adrien over to check her calculations. It was almost time for Adrien leave when they finally finished.\n\u201cOk, so, just so you know, these data points are far from exact. After all, we don\u2019t know how long after the initial stimulus Hawkmoth sends the Akuma, so all we really have is a search radius of where Hawkmoth\u2019s lair might be, not a solid address, but it\u2019s a solid start.\u201d\nOn the map, they had charted out the akumas paths and had colored in the search radius that they had calculated. Marinette gasped and Adrien had to fight down the bile rising in his throat.\nIn the middle of their search radius, highlighted in red marker, was the Agreste mansion.\n\n\u201cWe need to tell Ladybug.\u201d Adrien said numbly. He was purposely \n\nnot\n\n thinking about how bad this looked. Ladybug had suspected his father of being Hawkmoth before, but hadn\u2019t given him any reason why. Could she have been right? Could the Collector have just been a red herring to throw them off the scent? Adrien pushed those thoughts from his mind, he could freak out later when he was alone with Plagg.\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette nodded and began rolling up the map, \u201cI\u2019ve learned a few tricks from Alya, so I should be able to track down Ladybug and give her this. For now, I think this should stay between us and the heroes. Who knows what Hawkmoth would do if he knew we were doing this.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien nodded. He wasn\u2019t worried about himself, he had superpowers, but he didn\u2019t want Marinette getting hurt when she was only trying to help. He stood up and gathered his bag, which had been lying forgotten in the corner of the room, \u201cSo, um, I guess I\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette startled from where she\u2019d apparently been lost in her own thoughts as well, \u201cuh, yeah. School. Tomorrow. Sure.\u201d\n\n\nAs Adrien left, he wondered how he was ever going to face his father.\n\n\nDinner that night was awkward. At least, more awkward than it normally was. Adrien just couldn\u2019t unsee the myriad of butterfly symbols strategically placed throughout the house. He\u2019d written it off as a coincidence before, but now? Now he wasn\u2019t so sure.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cRemember you have a photoshoot during your afternoon classes tomorrow, then a chinese lesson after fencing practice. Your father expects you to reach an advanced level by the end of the month.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes Natalie.\u201d Did Natalie know? Was she involved somehow?\n\n\n\u201cAre you feeling well, Adrien? You\u2019ve been playing with your food for the past five minutes.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien set down his fork, \u201cum... I\u2019m fine, I guess it\u2019s just kind of been a long day and I\u2019m not really that hungry?\u201d He looked up at Natalie, who was scowling slightly.\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not sick, you need to finish your food Adrien. Your nutritionist would have a heart attack if you\u2019re not getting enough calories, not to mention the legal issues.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien nodded and forced down another few bites of food. Wonderful, yet another way he was failing to live up to expectations. And wasn\u2019t it telling that it was the nutritionist that would care, not Father or Natalie?\n\n\nThe rest of the meal passed in silence. Adrien finished his food and got up to go back to his room when the door opened.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHello Adrien.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHello Father.\u201d\n\n\nWhy? Normally, Adrien would have been ecstatic to have his father come to dinner, even if it was just at the end, but after the revelations of the afternoon, it was all he could do to act natural. Of all the days for his father to talk to him, why did it have to be today?\n\n\n\u201cI was informed that you disappeared this afternoon. Do you have any explanation why?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien\u2019s mouth went dry and his stomach sunk, \u201cI told my bodyguard that I went over to a friend\u2019s for homework.\u201d\n\n\nGabriel\u2019s glare hardened, \u201cMs. Rossi said she hasn\u2019t seen you since before the akuma attack.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d actually checked? \u201cLila's not my only friend.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the only one I have approved of.\u201d Gabriel turned to leave, \u201cYou are grounded for the next week. If I hear of you going over \u2018to a friend\u2019s house\u2019 again, you\u2019ll be staying home from school for a week. Do you understand?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes Father.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood. Sleep well, Adrien.\u201d\n\n\nToday sucked.\n\n\n\u201cJust because your house is in the search radius does not automatically mean your father is Hawkmoth. Just \u2018cause the man\u2019s a dick doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a supervillain.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut he might be. Just think, Plagg, is there anyone else that Ladybug has suspected? I didn\u2019t want to believe her then, but Ladybug doesn\u2019t do things like that without a good reason. And if Father is Hawkmoth then that means that Natalie is probably Mayura and oh my god, is Gorilla involved? I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do! I\u2019m living in the same house as a supervillain!\u201d\n\n\nPlagg bopped Adrien lightly on the nose, \u201cStop that. This whole mathy science thing isn\u2019t exact, especially since your girlfriend was just writing down things as she went.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not my girlfriend,\u201d Adrien muttered, but he was freaking out anymore.\u00a0\n\n\nPlagg smiled, \u201cWhatever you say, lover boy.\u201d Adrien glared at him, but since when had Plagg let that stop him, \u201cBesides, even if your dad \n\nis\n\n Hawkmoth, that wouldn\u2019t be a recent development, meaning that you\u2019ve been living under the same roof as the supervillain for almost a year now. The only difference is that now you \n\nknow\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien sighed, \u201cI have no idea if that was supposed to be comforting or ominous.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI try.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien looked out his window at the moon, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n\nPlagg swallowed the piece of cheese he was holding and let himself be sucked into the ring. Tonight was going to be interesting.\n\n\nLadybug was already waiting for him with a rolled up map slung across her back when Chat arrived at the Eiffel Tower for patrol.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHey Kitty, we need to talk.\u201d\n\n\nHe already knew what this was about, but he knew he wasn\u2019t supposed to, \u201cWhat? Has M\nilady finally realized that I\u2019m the cat\u2019s meow?\u201d\n\n\nShe smiled sadly, \u201cNot tonight, Chat. Do you remember Marinette Dupain-Cheng?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the bakery girl, right?\u201d\n\n\nLadybug nodded, \u201cWell, she tracked me down today. Apparently she\u2019s been tracking akumas and she and Adrien Agreste compiled the data earlier today and, well...maybe it\u2019s better if I show you the map.\u00a0\n\n\nShe stretched it out on the support beam between them and Chat studied it for a minute. Somehow it looked different than it had this afternoon. It seemed more important somehow, like it was telling him that this was his fault and his responsibility. It was probably because he was transformed, or maybe because he\u2019d actually seen his father that day. After a few minutes, he looked up at his partner.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve suspected Gabriel Agreste of being Hawkmoth before.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she hugged herself, \u201cAnd I know it sounds paranoid to think he might have akumatized himself to cover his tracks, but what if he did? What if we\u2019ve really known who he was for months and just couldn\u2019t see it?\u201d\n\n\nChat rolled up the map and handed it back to Ladybug, \u201cWhy did we suspect him the first time? I don\u2019t think you ever told me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was because of guardian stuff.\u201d Chat raised an eyebrow, and Ladybug sighed, \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you then because you didn\u2019t know about the guardian yet. I\u2019d only just found out and Tikki only took me to him because she had to. Gabriel Agreste had a book. A spellbook entirely on the miraculous and their properties written in a code known \n\nonly\n\n to the guardians.\u201d\n\n\nChat\u2019s eyes widened as he remembered. He\u2019d gotten pulled from school because of that book.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMaster Fu told me that the spellbook was lost at the same time as the Butterfly and Peacock miraculouses. He said that since all three were lost together, it was likely that whoever found the book, also found the miraculous.\u201d\n\n\nChat nodded as he processed everything, \u201cThat...makes a lot of sense. So, if he has this book and he lives right where the akumas seem to be coming from, then\u2026\u201d\n\n\nLadybug nodded, \u201cThen the evidence is piling up and there\u2019s a strong possibility that Gabriel Agreste really is Hawkmoth.\u201d\n\n\nChat looked out over the city, \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, right? I mean, now that we know who he is, we might actually be able to stop him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI guess,\u201d she fiddled with her yoyo, \u201cIt\u2019s just, where do we go from here? Right now all we\u2019ve got are coincidences and conjectures and that\u2019s not nearly enough to go in guns blazing. Besides that, he\u2019s got a son. I don\u2019t want Adrien getting caught in the crossfire.\u201d\n\n\nChat\u2019s heart warmed in spite of the conversation. His lady cared! But she raised a valid point.\n\n\n\u201cMaybe we should talk to Master Fu about this. Even if he doesn\u2019t have any advice, it\u2019s still probably something he should know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. Would you like to do it this time, Kitty?\u201d\n\n\nChat shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s probably safer for you to. You already know where he lives and I\u2019m grounded, so it\u2019ll be harder to sneak away.\u201d Not to mention the danger if his father realized what was going on and followed him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you do kitty, push all the mugs off the table?\u201d\n\n\nChat smiled, \u201cSomething like that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll talk to him tomorrow then. Goodnight kitty.\u201d She threw her yoyo and swung off into the night. Chat stood watching her disappear for a few minutes, reluctant to go back to the place he called home.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGoodnight Milady.\u201d\n\nThings were kind of awkward between Marinette and Adrien the next day. Marinette felt like the glances they shared were  heavier  somehow, now that they had this huge secret they shared. She wished she could be just a little happier about it. They knew who Hawkmoth might be, or at least where to look for him if it didn\u2019t end up being Gabriel Agreste, she had already told Chat Noir and was going to tell the guardian. Her plan had worked, everything was looking up, and enduring Lila\u2019s bullying had been worth it. Then why did she feel so down?\nShe looked over at Adrien, who was trying, and failing, to dodge out of the way as Lila kissed him on the cheek. Oh. right. Adrien knew that his dad might be Hawkmoth. Marinette tried to imagine her own father as a supervillain and shuddered. It had been bad enough when her dad had been akumatized, she didn\u2019t want to think about how she would feel if he was pulling the strings of his own free will. Adrien must be feeling even worse than she was right now.\u00a0\n\u201cHey girl! We\u2019re going to that new place downtown that Lila recommended for lunch. Do you want to come with us?\u201d Alya asked.\u00a0\nMarinette looked up from where she was gathering her books and saw Alya, Nino, with Lila hanging off Adrien\u2019s arm right beside them. Lila was glaring daggers at Marinette, but whether Lila was daring her to say yes or no, Marinette didn\u2019t know and at this point honestly didn\u2019t care. She needed to talk to Fu anyway.\u00a0\nMarinette shot Adrien an apologetic glance, \u201cSorry guys, not today, I already have plans during lunch.\u201d\nAlya looked like she was about to say something else, but Lila beat her to it, \u201cOh, Marinette! I didn\u2019t know you didn\u2019t like that place! We were so looking forward to you coming with us! Unless, of course, there\u2019s some  other  reason you don\u2019t want to come\u2026\u201d Lila gave the most horrendous fake pout Marinette had ever seen and she grit her teeth.\n\u201cNo Lila, the reason I\u2019m not coming is because I legitimately have things I need to do today. It has nothing to do with you or with the restaurant.\u201d\u00a0\nMarinette saw Adrien glancing around and it took her a moment to realize that he was looking for an akuma. She took a deep breath and finished putting her books away, \u201cHave fun guys, I\u2019ll see you this afternoon.\u201d\nLila glared at Marinette suspiciously as she left. Something was going on between Marinette and  her  Adrien and she needed to put a stop to it.\n\u201cHello Marinette, I\u2019ll be with you in just a moment.\u201d Master Fu finished ringing out his current customer and waved to him as he left.\u00a0\n\u201cTo what do I owe the pleasure Marinette? I did not believe there was an akuma today.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need another Miraculous. It\u2019s actually, um, can we go in the back?\u201d\nFu nodded and led Marinette into the back room of the shop. She unrolled the map that she\u2019d run home to get and let him look at it.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve been tracking akumas for a few months now, both those that have targeted me and those that have targeted others, and yesterday, I used this map to create a search radius. I know that we already crossed Gabriel Agreste off the list and that Hawkmoth could be anyone within this area, it\u2019s just\u2026what if we were wrong?\u201d\nFu silently studied the map for a moment, \u201cI see, this is concerning. Have you already spoken to Chat Noir about this?\u201d\nMarinette nodded, \u201cYes, he came to the same conclusion as I did: that The Collector might have been a red herring designed to throw us off the trail. But Master, we might have another problem if Gabriel Agreste really is Hawkmoth.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what is that, Marinette?\u201d\nMarinette bit her lip, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not very good at math, I can pass classes, but barely, and so I asked one of my classmates for help with the calculations and\u2026\u201d she took a deep breath, \u201cthe classmate I asked was Adrien Agreste. He knows his dad might be Hawkmoth and what if he tells him? I want to be able to trust Adrien, but this is  huge  and Gabriel is his  Father  ! I can\u2019t expect him to work against his own dad, even if it  is  for the good of Paris!\u201d\nFu got a pensive look on his face and was silent for a few minutes. Marinette was beginning to worry that she\u2019d said something wrong when he finally spoke again.\u00a0\n\u201cI think,\u201d Master Fu said slowly, \u201cThat it is time for you and Chat Noir to reveal your identities.\u201d\u00a0\nMarinette looked at the guardian like he\u2019d grown a second head, \u201cWhat? Why now in the middle of everything? It\u2019s not any safer now than it ever has been, in fact it might be  more  dangerous now that we have a lead on Hawkmoth\u2019s identity. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to wait until we\u2019ve beaten him? \u201d\n\u201cYou will understand in time. For now what you need to know is that now more than ever you and Chat Noir need to be truly united and able to support one another both in and out of the masks. You were always meant to be Yin and Yang, but I was afraid of what might happen if you revealed your identities, especially with Hawkmoth\u2019s powers on the loose.\u201d\nMarinette processed this information, \u201cCan I think about it?\u201d\u00a0\nFu nodded, \u201cOf course, I will reach out to Chat Noir and discuss this with him as well. Goodbye Marinette.\u201d\nShe nodded and left the massage parlor, too lost in her thoughts to say anything.\nThe rest of the school day passed quickly and Marinette was too busy worrying about whether or not she should reveal her identity to Chat to even think about Lila. Or she was too busy, at least until Lila cornered her in the locker room after everyone else had left.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on between you and Adrien?\u201d\nMarinette\u2019s eyes widened. Could Lila know that they had tracked down Hawkmoth? That would be bad, Lila had been willingly akumatized before. She might be more likely to tip the villain off than Adrien was. Marinette quickly schooled her expression into one of passive indifference.\u00a0\n\u201cNothing\u2019s going on, Lila, you\u2019ve made sure of that.\u201d\nLila smiled at the praise but leaned closer to Marinette, \u201cYeah right, Marinette. I\u2019ve seen the looks you two share in class. But,\u201d she leaned back, \u201cI don\u2019t know what is going on between you and Adrien, and honestly I don\u2019t really care, just put a stop to it, or I will destroy you. Remember this, Marinette, Adrien is  mine. \u201d\n\u201cAdrien, your Chinese tutor got sick at the last minute and sent a substitute.\u201d Natalie said as she opened the door to his room, stoic as ever.\nAdrien perked up. Of course, there was a chance that this was just a normal substitute, but with what he and Ladybug talked about last night, Adrien wouldn\u2019t bet on that.\u00a0\n\u201cHello, Adrien.\u201d Master Fu smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again. I wish it was under better circumstances.\u201d\n\u201cWork hard Adrien, I want to hear good things from your regular tutor when he gets back.\u201d And with that, Natalie left. Adrien bowed to the Guardian.\u00a0\n\u201cHello Master Fu,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re here because of what Marinette Dupain-Cheng and I discovered about Hawkmoth\u2019s identity.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of it, yes, but not the main reason why I\u2019ve come.\u201d\n\u201cWhat could possibly be more important than the fact that my own father might be Hawkmoth?\u201d Adrien said bitterly.\n\u201cThe time is right for you and Ladybug to reveal your identities to one another.\u201d Fu waited for Adrien\u2019s reaction.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nFu\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cI thought you would be happy. Have you not wanted to know the girl behind the mask for quite some time now?\u201d\nAdrien didn\u2019t look at Fu, instead focusing all his attention on scratching Plagg behind the ears, \u201cThat was before\u2026\u201d he scowled, \u201cbefore I realized I was living under the same roof as the biggest villain in Paris and  didn\u2019t notice. \u201d\n\u201cAdrien\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo! I can\u2019t tell her who I am now! What would she even think of me? I\u2019m not even worthy to be a hero!\u201d\n\u201cStop that!\u201d Plagg scratched at Adrein\u2019s hand and he stared at his kwami in shock, \u201cDon\u2019t go getting it into your head that you aren\u2019t worthy to be Chat Noir because  you are!  If your dad is Hawkmoth that\u2019s on  him  not on you. And  you  need someone to be there for you and keep you from going into a self-blame spiral.\u201d\nAdrien sighed, \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve got you for Plagg.\u201d\nPlagg rolled his eyes, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve finally figured out how amazing I am, but you\u2019re going to need more than some stinky old cat god to get you through this. It\u2019s why you even have a partner in the first place, so you don\u2019t have to do all the hard stuff alone.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Adrien was quiet, \u201cisn\u2019t that selfish? Isn\u2019t it wrong to need help when it\u2019s my own fault I\u2019m in this situation in the first place?\u201d\nPlagg growled while Fu\u2019s eyes filled with compassion, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault that Hawkmoth is active.\u201d Adrien opened his mouth to protest, but Fu held up a hand to stop him, \u201cAnd even if it  was,  it would still not be selfish to ask for help. The holders of the ladybug and black cat miraculouses are supposed to be there for each other through thick and thin, yin and yang. There is no shame in needing support from your other half.\u201d\nAdrien hesitated and Plagg flew up to look his holder in the eye, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this alone, Adrien, trust us. We\u2019re all here for you. We care about you, and so does Ladybug.\u201d\nAdrien sighed, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll trust you.\u201d He looked back to Master Fu, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her tonight. I really hope you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\nFu nodded, \u201cGood luck, Chat Noir. Now, I believe I was supposed to be teaching you something about the Chinese language, was I not?\u201d\nMeanwhile, Marinette was having a breakdown.\nTikki tried to keep up as Marinette paced back and forth in her room, talking so quickly that Tikki could really only make out every third sentence, but what she could understand didn\u2019t sound good for her holder\u2019s mental health.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy now? What if he hates me? What if he just sees clumsy Marinette and decides I\u2019m not fit to be ladybug? What if he tries to take my earrings and by ladybug himself? Oh no! What if he tries to flirt with me as a civilian too? What if he\u2019s jealous of Adrien and tries to hurt him? Then we\u2019ll never have three kids and a hamster!\u201d\n\u201cMarinette, calm down!\u201d Tikki interrupted, but Marinette didn\u2019t seem to hear her\n\u201cHow is this going to affect our partnership? What if we can\u2019t trust each other anymore? What if he\u2019s mad at me for lying to him to keep my secret identity? What if this ruins everything?!\u201d\n\u201cMarinette!\u201d Tikki flew in front of Marinette\u2019s face, forcing her to stop pacing, \u201cYou\u2019re catastrophizing again! Chat isn\u2019t going to be mad at you, and he\u2019s not going to hate you. You trust Chat, right?\u201d\nMarinette nodded with wide eyes.\n\u201cAnd you know that neither of you are perfect, right?\u201d\nShe nodded again.\n\u201cSo what is there to worry about? Yeah, knowing each other\u2019s identities will probably change your dynamic, but it will bring you closer, not drive you further apart!\u201d\nMarinette sighed and let Tikki land in her cupped hands, \u201cYou\u2019re right Tikki. Chat and I have been through a lot together and we\u2019ve gotten through it. This won\u2019t be any different.\u201d\nTikki giggled, \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be able to see each other outside of akuma attacks.\u201d\nMarinette smiled and rolled her eyes, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go insane from all the puns.\u201d She sighed, \u201cTikki, are you  sure  this is the right time? We have so much going on now that we have a lead on Hawkmoth. What if Master Fu is wrong and this is just too much too soon?\u201d\n\u201cI think Master Fu is making the right call, Marinette. You\u2019ll understand soon.\u201d\nMarinette looked at her kwami suspiciously, \u201cThat\u2019s what Master Fu said, too\u2026\u201d\nTikki smiled, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s because it\u2019s true!\u201d\nMarinette returned the smile, \u201cOr maybe it\u2019s because both of you are trying to sound wiser than you really are.\u201d\nThe tension broke as they both dissolved into giggles. Yeah, a reveal would change things, but they\u2019d get through it. They always did.\n\nWhen Ladybug arrived for patrol, Chat Noir was already waiting for her, dangling his feet off the edge of the Eiffel tower and looking out over the lights of Paris.\u00a0\n\n\nShe landed next to him and sat down, \u201cHey.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d\n\n\nThey just sat in silence for a few minutes, neither of them looking at the other. Ladybug bit her lip. Should she say something? Master Fu had said revealing their identities was for the best but did it have to be so \n\nawkward?\n\n\n\nChat broke the silence, but still refused to look at Ladybug, \u201cSo\u2026 Master Fu talked to you too?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUm...do you wanna?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. I mean, not really, but I can see it\u2019s probably for the best. Leap of faith and all that. Right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Chat chuckled bitterly, \u201cI\u2019m kinda in the same boat.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Ladybug looked at him in shock, \u201cI thought you always wanted to know who I was.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat was before\u2026 well, you\u2019ll understand soon.\u201d\n\n\nLadybug groaned, \u201cI\u2019m getting really sick of people telling me that. First Master Fu, then Tikki, now you! I just want to understand \n\nnow!\n\n Is that too much to ask?\u201d\n\n\nChat laughed and Ladybug smiled, the awkward tension still there, but a little more bearable than it had been a few minutes ago.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Chat got up and stretched, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to get this over with, we should probably go someplace a little more private than a national icon.\u201d\n\n\nLadybug nodded, \u201cYeah, there\u2019s a pretty secluded rooftop over in the thirteenth arrondissement, if you want to go there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLead the way, Milady.\u201d\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t take them long to reach their destination, despite stopping and waving to a few different groups that had been walking around Paris in the night. They each did a lap around the roof, looking for any eavesdroppers or cameras that could cause problems.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce they were certain that they wouldn\u2019t be seen, Ladybug turned to Chat, \u201cSo, on three I guess?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Ladybug noticed him nervously playing with his ring and her eyes narrowed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready for this?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe sighed, \u201cNo, but waiting isn\u2019t helping either.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk, yeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust,\u201d Chat hesitated, \u201cpromise me that you won\u2019t think any less of me once you know who I am?\u201d\n\n\nLadybug\u2019s face softened, \u201cOh kitty, I doubt I could ever think any less of you, unless you were, like, Chloe under the mask or something.\u201d\n\n\nChat snickered, \u201cThat would be \n\nridiculous, utterly ridiculous!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether to be impressed or horrified that you\u2019re so good at that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of experience...you\u2019ll understand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSeriously? Stop saying that!\u201d\n\n\nChat laughed before sobering. Ladybug took a deep breath, \u201cOn three?\u201d\n\n\nChat nodded.\n\n\n\u201cOne, two, three!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSpots off!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cClaws in!\u201d\n\n\nAs the sparkles faded, Marinette looked at Adrien, who was standing in front of her nervously, \u201cOh\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cI understand now\u2026\u201d\n\n\nAdrien lost it and started laughing, \u201cThat\u2019s all you can say? And of course \n\nyou\n\n would be Ladybug! Who else would think to turn a horrible situation around and track down Hawkmoth. You\u2019re so creative, Marinette!\u201d He frowned, \u201cI\u2019m not even good enough to be your friend, let alone your partner. I couldn\u2019t even tell that my own father was a terrorist.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette crossed her arms and glared at Adrien, \u201c\n\nMight \n\nbe a terrorist and don\u2019t talk about my friend that way!\u201d Adrien looked around then looked at Marinette in confusion, \u201cI\u2019m talking about \n\nyou\n\n, you dork.\u201d Adrien\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cYou are just as amazing as I am, maybe even more so, the way that you put up with your fame even though it annoys you, your capability to be silly and calm me down when things get tough. Even your stupid puns! Adrien, we might have different strengths but that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. Yin and Yang, right?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien drew a shaky breath and blinked away tears, \u201cRight.\u201d He smiled hesitantly, \u201cYou and me against the world?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette took his hand and looked her kitty in the eye, \u201cYou and me against the world.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette thought that things would be hugely different at school the next day, and she didn\u2019t know whether to be relieved or disappointed that nothing much had changed. She was still being isolated at every turn and none of her friends could see how they were being manipulated to exclude her and even start hating her. She was pretty sure Alya had been about to invite her to lunch again when Lila swooped in and whispered something in the reporter\u2019s ear. Alya had gotten a disappointed look on her face when she glanced at Marinette, but then had walked away without saying anything. Marinette had eaten lunch alone. Again.\u00a0\n\n\nMeanwhile, Adrien was still being held prisoner by Lila. Every time he tried to come talk to Marinette or even just go someplace on his own, Lila was there, hanging off his arm and fake laughing in that high-pitched way that made Marinette cringe. Lila was being even more physical than usual today, probably to counteract whatever she \n\nthought\n\n was going on between Marinette and Adrien. Adrien gave Marinette a helpless look as he walked into the classroom with Lila, Alya, and Nino after lunch, \n\nI\u2019m sorry.\n\n\n\nShe shook her head and smiled, \n\nIt\u2019s ok, it\u2019s not your fault.\n\n\n\nAt least now she knew why it was so easy to read Adrien\u2019s body language. Alya had posted a theory once that Ladybug and Chat Noir were telepathic because of how easily they understood one another, even in the midst of battle. Marinette chuckled to herself, she was pretty sure she would literally die of embarrassment if Adrien could hear her thoughts. No, they\u2019ve just had \n\na lot \n\nof practice.\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien grimaced slightly as Lila kissed him on the cheek, then pulled a face and stuck his tongue out at Marinette when no one was looking. She giggled quietly behind her hand. \n\nGood luck, Lila\n\n, she thought, \n\nno one\u2019s ever taking my silly kitty away from me.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThey would get through this. Marinette knew they would. They were Ladybug and Chat Noir, Marinette Dupan-Cheng and Adrien Agreste, yin and yang, and they would always be there for each other. They would get through this, no matter what happens, because \n\nthat\u2019s what they do.\n\n That\u2019s what they\u2019ve always done, and Marinette didn\u2019t see any reason for them to stop now.\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette tuned out Miss Bustier as she started to drone on about sixteenth century literature and pulled out her phone. There had been something on her mind ever since she and Adrien had finished their map. The look in his eyes when he had realized that his dad might be Hawkmoth wasn\u2019t something Marinette ever wanted to see again. Even worse, the hurt and guilt she heard when he talked after they\u2019d revealed their identities the night before. Marinette hoped they were wrong about Gabriel, if only so that Adrien didn\u2019t have to deal with those feelings ever again.\n\n\nIf Gabriel Agreste was Hawkmoth, Marinette wanted to get Adrien out of that house as soon as possible. Having two warring miraculous holders under the same roof was a recipe for disaster, especially when one was willing to tear Paris apart to get what he wanted. And if and when Gabriel gets arrested...Marinette didn\u2019t want her kitty to be sent away. She knew that Adrien wasn\u2019t thinking about that, he would be willing to do whatever it took to put Hawkmoth behind bars, even if it meant risking his own happiness, but Marinette didn\u2019t want to lose him.\u00a0\n\n\n\nEmancipation laws in Paris\n\n\n\nMarinette skimmed through the results of her search, clicking on various links and reading the various laws on child rights. She felt her heart sink as her brain put together what she could understand out of the legal jargon. Proof of financial means wasn\u2019t a problem, even if he stopped modeling for his father, Adrien had his savings and other companies would jump to have him as a model. Even a secure place to live wouldn\u2019t be difficult, since he would always be welcome at her place or even Nino\u2019s. What was a problem was the age.\u00a0\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\nShe briefly considered waiting to capture Hawkmoth until Adrien could legally emancipate himself before tossing the idea out the window. Even if it was the only option, Adrien would never agree to it. Paris had already suffered enough, and it was their job as heroes to save it as soon as possible. It was why they had been chosen.\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette resisted the urge to groan in frustration and hit her head against the desk. Either would draw far too much attention when she was supposed to be listening to the lecture. She looked hard at the back of Adrien\u2019s head in front of her. What was she supposed to do? She was supposed to protect Paris, but she also had to protect her partner. Ugh. Why did life have to be so hard?\n\n\nShe half listened to the lecture for a few minutes, doodling in the margins of her notebook and jotting down a few things that sounded important, all while her mind continued to work on the real problem. How could she make sure Adrien would be safe and taken care of, even if Gabriel was arrested?\n\n\nShe paused and chewed her lip as an idea occurred to her. She glanced one last time at the back of Adrien\u2019s head before unlocking her phone again and opening up a new search.\n\n\n\nFoster laws in France \n\n\n\u201cWhat if we set up cameras?\u201d\nMarinette was pinching herself and trying not to imagine Marinette-of-a-week-ago\u2019s reaction to  the Adrien Agreste  laying on her bed, repeatedly throwing a ball of yarn up in the air like it was no big deal.\u00a0\n\u201cUm\u2026 I mean, that could work, but doesn\u2019t your dad\u2019s place already have security cameras?\u201d\nAdrien paused, then started throwing his yarn ball again, \u201cI mean, yeah, that\u2019s how I got the idea. He apparently has one in his office and that\u2019s how he knew I stole the spell book, but it\u2019s not like I have access to any of them. Also, I\u2019m assuming he doesn\u2019t have cameras anywhere that he\u2019d transform, because my bodyguard is probably one of the biggest hero fanboys I\u2019ve ever met outside of Alya, and I\u2019m going to assume for my sanity that he probably doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cOk, so we\u2019d need to get cameras and set them up in places your dad wouldn\u2019t notice and make sure we have access to the feed. We should probably also check with the police force to see if we need warrants for any of this\u2026 we don\u2019t want to go through all this and then not have our evidence be admissible in court.\u201d\nAdrien propped himself up on his elbow and looked down at her, \u201cI hadn\u2019t even thought about that. They\u2019re not going to tell him, are they?\u201d\nMarinette shrugged and started erasing a line that wasn\u2019t quite where she wanted it, \u201cI mean, if we explain, then they shouldn\u2019t. There\u2019s also the possibility that they might not even ask who exactly we\u2019re investigating. They tend to give us pretty much free reign to do what we need to, most of the time.\u201d\nAdrien hummed in agreement and layed back down, \u201cI wish it was easier to just see if he or Natalie ever disappear during akuma attacks. If I actually saw Father more than once a month, I\u2019d just know and then we wouldn\u2019t have to do this whole stupid song and dance routine to find out if he\u2019s a supervillain.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s his fault for being a bad father, Adrien, not yours.\u201d\n\u201cI  know  that, it\u2019s just,\u201d he groaned, \u201cit just doesn\u2019t feel like it sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cMarinette! Your father just made a batch of cinnamon rolls, do you want any?\u201d Sabine poked her head into Marinette\u2019s room and both kids looked at her with wide eyes, \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it Sabine, what\u2019s wrong\u2026 oh.\u201d Tom\u2019s head joined Sabine\u2019s, \u201cAdrien, I didn\u2019t know you were here...wait, how did you get in? You would\u2019ve had to come past us to get up here.\u201d\nMarinette and Adrien both glanced at the skylight, then looked at each other in panic, trying to come up with any reasonable explanation. It wasn\u2019t like they could just say,  oh, Adrien is just Chat Noir and he sneaked out of his father\u2019s house because he might be Hawkmoth and keeps him locked up so that he never sees any of his friends and he came in through the roof because honestly neither of us remembered that was weird for anyone who wasn\u2019t a superhero. \nUnfortunately, that brief glance was enough for Marinette\u2019s parents, \u201cYou do know you could have come in through the front door...right?\u201d Sabine said hesitantly.\u00a0\nTom nodded in agreement, \u201cWe don\u2019t mind Marinette\u2019s friends coming over, you don\u2019t have to sneak around.\u201d\nMarinette thought quickly, \u201cAdrien doesn\u2019t want his dad to know he\u2019s here,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cHis dad\u2019s really strict and doesn\u2019t\u00a0 let him out of the house. And since he\u2019s kinda famous, if he came in through the front door, then his fans would see him and they\u2019d tweet about it and...\u201d she trailed off as her parents looked at Adrien sympathetically.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really no trouble,\u201d Adrien said quickly, \u201cI have a climbing wall in my room and stuff so I\u2019m used to high places.\u201d Her parents didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cIt\u2019s fun?\u201d He added hesitantly.\n\u201cO-ok? Well, um,\u201d Sabine looked at Tom, who nodded, \u201cif you\u2019re going to be coming in through the roof then we need to know when you\u2019re here and the trap door stays  unlocked.  Do you hear me?\u201d\u00a0\nBoth kids\u2019 faces erupted into identical shades of scarlet.\n\u201cMamman!\u201d Marinette yelled as she buried her face in her hands, \u201cIt\u2019s not like that!\u201d\nAdrien just opened and closed his mouth, unable to come up with a single word in his defense.\nSabine smiled mischievously, \u201cWell, then, can I get you kids some cinnamon rolls?\u201d\u00a0\nShe and Tom chuckled as they went back downstairs, they were going to have so much fun teasing Marinette about this.\n\u201cSo, you want a warrant to place cameras in places you think Hawkmoth might be?\u201d\nLadybug and Chat Noir looked at each other and nodded. Officer Raincomprix hummed, \u201cWell, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem. You  are  superheroes, and that gives you a certain measure of authority. I think\u2026\u201d He ruffled through some files in the cabinet by his desk, \u201cAh, here it is! Yes, when you two first came on the scene, lawmakers were concerned about how you were going to interact with law enforcement, and the mayor decided it was best to not even bother. According to this law, you two have carte blanche to do whatever is necessary to find Hawkmoth and bring him to justice. It seems a little excessive to me, but those are the Mayor\u2019s orders. You being superheroes is enough of a warrant, apparently, just keep us informed and let us know when it\u2019s time to arrest the scumbag.\u201d\n\u201cSo, we don\u2019t need to tell you where we\u2019re putting up cameras, just that we\u2019re putting them up?\u201d\nOfficer Raincomprix nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Honestly, I\u2019m just glad you two have a solid lead to find the guy. I\u2019m excited for this nightmare to finally be over.\u201d\nLadybug nodded, \u201cUs too. Thanks for your help!\u201d\nThe heroes left the police station and vaulted up to the rooftops, running along until they reached their favorite spot on the Eiffel tower.\u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d Chat said, \u201cthat was easy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Ladybug played with her yoyo, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m kinda uncomfortable with just how much power they gave us. I mean, what if Volpina had actually convinced Paris she was a superhero? What would  she  have done? And they didn\u2019t even tell us!\u201d\nChat thought for a moment, \u201cVolpina probably wouldn\u2019t have used it to find Hawkmoth, which is the condition of the law in the first place. But, yeah, on the one hand I agree with you that it\u2019s too much power for two random kids in masks, but on the other, I\u2019m happy that they trust us so much, and it really does make this whole situation a lot easier. So...I\u2019m torn, but I guess it doesn\u2019t really matter. The mayor gave us this freedom for a reason, we may as well use it.\u201d\nLadybug sighed, \u201cI guess you\u2019re right\u2026\u201d\nChat smiled, \u201cOf course I am, Bugaboo! So now that we know we aren\u2019t breaking any laws, how are we going to do this? Natalie tracks my purchases, so it\u2019s probably better if you\u2019re the one to actually buy the cameras, but I can probably pay for them.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between paying and actually buying them yourself?\u201d\nChat rubbed the back of his neck, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got a decent cash fund that Natalie doesn\u2019t know about, I\u2019ve been taking a little bit out of my modeling paychecks for years to build it up. I normally use it to buy Plagg\u2019s cheese, but this is a worthy cause too.\u201d\n\u201cKitty...I can\u2019t ask you to do that\u2026that\u2019s  your  money\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell, right now, it\u2019s kinda more like Plagg\u2019s money, and we can consider this payback for all the times he left cheese crumbs in my sock drawer!\u201d\nLadybug rolled her eyes, \u201cKitty\u2026\u201d\nChat folded his arms and gave her a grin, \u201cToo late! I\u2019m paying. I\u2019ll bring the cash by sometime when I can sneak out.\u201d\nLadybug sighed, knowing that nothing was going to change his mind now, \u201cFine, where are we going to put the cameras.\u201d\n\u201cThe mansion.\u201d\nLadybug shot Chat a glare, only to be met with a mischievous grin. He kept smiling, but held up his hands in mock surrender, \u201cKidding! But no, we should definitely put one in Father\u2019s office, and maybe in the kitchen too, I doubt he gets food for his kwami, but Natalie probably gets enough food for the two.\u201d\n\u201cGood idea...and we\u2019ll need to make sure we don\u2019t get caught putting them up.\u201d\n\u201cEasy, we\u2019ll just have Plagg and Tikki do it for us!\u201d\n\u201cOh really?\u201d Ladybug put her hands on her hips, \u201cAnd how are you going to explain to your bodyguard randomly floating cameras?\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Chat thought for a moment, \u201cHmm...I\u2019m pretty sure that Gorilla would show me the camera feeds for the house if I asked. As long as I only do it once, it shouldn\u2019t be too suspicious. Then I can figure out where there are blindspots and we can use those so Plagg and Tikki won\u2019t be seen flying with our cameras!\u201d\n\u201c...and I think it\u2019d be interesting to know more about what goes into protecting me, you know?\u201d\nAdrien shifted awkwardly as his bodyguard glared at him. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t so much of a glare as an appraising look and Adrien was just imagining it because the gorilla always looked angry. Either way, there was a long moment of silence in which Adrien was sure that his plan wouldn\u2019t work and they\u2019d have to come up with another way to find the camera's blindspots before his bodyguard grunted and started down the hall. When Adrien didn\u2019t follow, the gorilla turned to look at him and jerked his head, indicating for him to follow and Adrien scrambled to catch up.\u00a0\nWhen they reached the control room, there was a wall of monitors, each showing different rooms of the mansion. The gorilla sat in the chair and started scanning the camera feeds with well practiced eyes as Adrien stood behind him and looked at each camera feed critically, memorizing what was shown and comparing it with the mental maps he had of the mansion. Adrien smiled, it would be pretty easy for Plagg and Tikki to avoid any cameras with this information. Most of the time, as long as they stayed close to the walls, they\u2019d be fine.\u00a0\nAdrien\u2019s eyebrows knit together as he scanned over the camera feeds again, \u201cIsn\u2019t there a camera in Father\u2019s office?\u201d\nThe gorilla looked at him and shook his head before turning back to the monitors. Adrien did the same, but wasn\u2019t really seeing the feeds.\u00a0\n\u201cSo there aren\u2019t any other cameras in the house that aren\u2019t shown here?\u201d\u00a0\nThe gorilla shook his head again and Adrien frowned. There  was a camera in that office, his father had used it to prove that Adrien had stolen the spellbook.\nSo why didn\u2019t the gorilla have access to it?\n\nMarinette hardly glanced up from her literature homework when she heard Chat Noir fall through her skylight.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cUgh! Why do we have to transform to visit your girlfriend? It\u2019s so much work!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not my girlfriend, Plagg.\u201d Adrien groaned. Marinette kept her eyes on her book in an attempt to hide her blush and tried to ignore the way her heart dropped. Adrien had too much to worry about right now to throw her crush into the mix.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhatever, just give me my cheese.\u201d Adrien threw a chunk of camembert toward his kwami, who caught it and went to sit with Tikki on the shelf. Adrien himself sprawled on the chaise.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSorry about him, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s a gremlin disguised as a cat. He literally exists to make my life miserable.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot a problem, Adrien, he \n\nis\n\n the embodiment to destruction.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe destruction of my sanity.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette giggled, \u201cSo, is there a reason for this visit, or did you just miss me?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien smiled, \u201cAlways, Milady.\u201d He sat up, \u201cBut I actually do have something for you.\u201d He pulled a thick envelope from his back pocket and handed it to her with a bow and a flourish, \u201cCash for cameras, Milady.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette took the envelope and her eyes widened when she saw how much was inside, \u201cAdrien! This is way too much!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPayback for Plagg being a gremlin, remember?\u201d He insisted, \u201cAnd besides, I needed to make sure you had enough to get ones that have audio and can automatically stream to your computer. It\u2019d be too risky to have to physically retrieve the camera every time we want to look at the feed.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette pouted but put the envelope in her purse, \u201cI guess you have a point kitty. I\u2019m just not used to handling this much money.\u201d She took a deep breath, \u201cMamman and Papa said dinner would be ready soon. Would you like any?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien perked up, \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s alright?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette giggled and booped him on the nose, \u201cOf course I\u2019m sure! Like Mamman and Papa said, you\u2019re always welcome here. Besides, I\u2019m pretty sure they show love through food. You just have to promise not to get in a pun war with Papa.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdrien\u2019s eyes twinkled, \u201cNo promises.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd these will automatically stream to my computer?\u201d\n\n\nThe salesperson nodded, \u201cYep, you\u2019ll just need to follow the instructions in the handbook before placing the cameras. You do need to be careful about battery life if you\u2019re trying to do time lapses, though. The battery will only last about three weeks before you need to charge it.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette nodded, there were akumas every few days, so three weeks should be more than enough time to get what they needed.\n\n\n\u201cWhy did you say you wanted these again? You\u2019re not trying to spy on the boy you like, are you?\u201d The salesperson teased.\n\n\nMarinette blushed and flailed her arms, \u201cNo bae! I mean, no way! The boy I like\u2019s a model anyway, so I have more than enough pictures of him\u2026\u201d She trailed off, realizing she wasn\u2019t helping her case at all, \u201cI\u2019m a designer, so I need good quality cameras to make videos of my designs and show that they\u2019re wearable and comfortable.\u201d\n\n\nThe salesperson laughed and rang her up, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I was just giving you a hard time. Good luck with your designing, I hope it goes well!\u201d\n\n\nMarinette nodded and thought of their plan, \u201cI hope so too.\u201d\n\n\nIt was after sunset when Ladybug knocked on Adrien\u2019s window. He hurried to let her in and she transformed as she landed on the floor.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHey kitty.\u201d Marinette said shyly.\n\n\nAdrien blushed. He went to her room all the time, why was it such a big deal that she was in his room. Oh no, Ladybug was in his room!\n\n\n\u201cU-uh, h-hi Milady.\u201d Adrien suddenly realized he was in his pajamas and he tried to discreetly pull at the hem of his shorts to make the longer, \u201cFancy seeing you here.\u201d\n\n\nThey were interrupted by Plagg\u2019s laughter, \u201cOh my goodness! You two are so awkward! I\u2019m gonna fall out of the air laughing!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlagg!\u201d Tikki flew out of Marinette\u2019s purse and hit Plagg over the head, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, all these milenia and he still hasn\u2019t learned \n\nmanners!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cManners are boring, sugarcube!\u201d Plagg whined.\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette rolled her eyes and went to sit on the couch. For the first time, Adrien noticed that she was carrying a plain black backpack. She slung it off her shoulder and opened it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo, I was able to buy five cameras. They have both visual and audio and I already took the liberty of setting them up so they\u2019ll sync the feed to my computer. I figured we should use mine because if Natalie tracks your purchases, she probably tracks your computer usage too, right?\u201d Adrien nodded, \u201cSo yeah, now you can just tell us where the blindspots are and we can have Plagg and Tikki set these up!\u201d\n\n\nPlagg groaned, \u201cYou\u2019re making me work? At this time of night? This is animal cruelty!\u201d\n\n\nTikki hit him over the head again, \u201cShut up and stop being such a lazy bum, Plagg!\u201d\n\n\nAdrien described where the blind spots were before handing the kwamis four of the cameras, \u201cPut on in Father\u2019s office, one in his room, one in Natalie\u2019s room, and the last will go in the kitchen. We\u2019ll keep the fifth camera in reserve, just in case we think of another location or one breaks.\u201d\n\n\nThe kwamis nodded and took two cameras each. Adrien cracked open his door and the two flew out. They went to the kitchen first, since that would probably be the easiest camera to place. They stayed close to the walls and out of sight from both humans and cameras. Plagg took one of Tikki\u2019s cameras, letting her have both hands free to screw the camera into the wall. From where it was, there was an excellent view of the pantry, so they should be able to see any floating food from snacking kwamis.\u00a0\n\n\nTikki took back her other camera and the two flew to Natalie\u2019s room. Plagg nodded to Tikki, who concentrated and phased through the wall. It took concentration to phase an object with her, so they tried not to do it often, but they couldn\u2019t wait for Natalie to open the door and risk her seeing them. She placed the camera in the corner where there were enough shadows to hide it and it had a good view of the room before phasing back out of the room.\u00a0\n\n\nPlagg handed her one of the remaining cameras so they both had one, then they flew to Gabriel\u2019s room. This time it was Plagg\u2019s turn to phase through the wall and fix the camera. He ended up setting it half-hidden behind a fake tree, since there wouldn\u2019t be enough shadows to hid it on the ceiling. He froze when he heard the door open and Gabriel walked in.\u00a0\n\n\nGabriel simply walked past Plagg\u2019s hiding place and strode over to the closet, taking off his garish tie. Plagg shuddered and phased through the wall behind him to meet back up with Tikki. He didn\u2019t need to see \n\nthat.\n\n\n\nFinally, it was time to place the camera in Gabriel\u2019s office. Thankfully, he was in his room, so they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about running into him, but the kwami\u2019s were still nervous. They knew there were cameras in this room, but Adrien hadn\u2019t been able to see the feed and so hadn\u2019t been able to figure out the blindspots. He thought he remembered that the feed didn\u2019t show the ceiling, but there was no way to know if there were other cameras that did.\u00a0\n\n\nTikki let her power course through her, giving her just a little more luck before the two phased into the office and flew near the ceiling. The portrait of Adrien\u2019s mother seemed to watch them conspiratorially, as if asking them what they were doing. They hurried and mounted the camera in one of the corners, making sure it was in the shadow of the decorative moulding the lined the room, then flew straight back to Adrien\u2019s room.\n\n\n\u201cDid everything go alright?\u201d Adrien asked nervously.\u00a0\n\n\nTikki nodded, \u201cNo one saw us and all the cameras are hidden and secure.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien and Marinette sighed in relief.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo, I guess now\u2019s the hard part.\u201d Marinette said, \u201cNow we have to wait.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAdrien,\u201d Natalie looked back at him in the rearview mirror from the front passenger seat, \u201cYou\u2019ve been texting that bakery girl more often.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien froze, \u201cMarinette?\u201d He asked. Natalie nodded.\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien\u2019s mind was whirling. He knew Father and Natalie were monitoring his computer, but they had spyware on his phone too? He\u2019d have to tell Marinette to be careful what they said over text. They\u2019d probably have to do all Hawkmoth communication over their miraculous phones from now on, not that they\u2019d ever texted about that much anyway.\n\n\n\u201cYour father is concerned. We want to make sure you have...\n\npositive\n\n influences. Why have you been texting this girl?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien swallowed, \u201cI just think she\u2019s really nice. She\u2019s one of my friends and a really talented designer.\u201d He added the last part hoping that it might convince his father. He waited with baited breath as Natalie\u2019s expression soured.\n\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of nice people in the world Adrien, and most are simply pretending because they want something from you. This girl is probably planning on using you to further her own goals in the fasion industry.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien\u2019s heart sunk, what could he say to convince her?\n\n\n\u201cMarinette isn\u2019t like that! I\u2019ve known her for a while now and she\u2019s really nice to everyone, even people like Mr. Ramier who can\u2019t give her anything back. She\u2019s smart and strong and confident. She always stands up for herself and others and her friends are the most important thing in the world to her\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe trailed off when he noticed Natalie\u2019s expression had softened, \u201cAdrien, be honest with me. Do you \n\nlike\n\n this girl?\u201d\n\n\nAdriend hesitated. He\u2019d always loved Ladybug, but he\u2019d always insisted Marinette was just a friend. Of course he \n\nliked\n\n her, but she didn\u2019t feel the same way. At the same time, would telling Natalie mean he was allowed to keep texting Marinette, or would she think she was some gold digger who was trying to sink her claws in him? He took another look at Natalie\u2019s expression and took a deep breath.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I think I do.\u201d\n\n\nNatalie nodded and turned back to her tablet, signaling that the conversation was over. Adrien let out the breath he\u2019d been holding and looked out the window. It wasn\u2019t necessarily approval, but Adrien decided that Natalie ignoring the issue was the best he could hope for. \n\n\nIt had been a few days since they set up the cameras, and almost a week since the last akuma attack and both Marinette and Adrien were getting frustrated by the lack of progress. Sure, they were noticing patterns in Gabriel\u2019s behavior, but none of them were directly related to Hawkmoth. Currently, the two were munching on chocolate chip cookies that Marinette\u2019s parents had insisted they eat and working on literature homework while half watching the camera feeds.\n\n\nMarinette watched as Natalie put her arms around Gabriel like she always seemed to do when he was stressed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIs your dad dating Natalie?\u201d She asked suddenly.\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien shrugged, \u201che insists it isn\u2019t like that, but I think they should just get together already. It\u2019s not like Mother is coming back anytime soon. I mean, she\u2019s been missing long enough that she\u2019s been legally declared dead, so\u2026\u201d\n\n\nMarinette looked at him, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien tilted his head slightly, \u201cWhat, Mother being gone or Father moving on?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette bit her lip, \u201cI don\u2019t know? Either, Both.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien thought about that for a minute, \u201cWell, I miss her, and it still hurts sometimes, but I guess I\u2019ve kinda moved on?\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cOh my goodness that sounds so bad, like it was a bad breakup instead of one of my parents disappearing.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe dragged both hands down his face, then looked at Marinette again, \u201cI\u2019ve mourned her, I guess. That sounds a little bit better.\u201d he exhaled heavily, \u201cI don\u2019t mind father moving on. In fact, I think it\u2019d probably be good for him. Healthy. I can tell he still misses mom, but I mean, he shouldn\u2019t be miserable forever. I don\u2019t think mom would want that anyway\u2026 I think she\u2019d want him to be happy, even if she couldn\u2019t be there for him.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThey sit in silence for a little while, reading the book Miss Bustier had assigned, but still mulling over the conversation in their minds.\u00a0\n\n\nSuddenly, Adrien\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cOh no. what if he\u2019s trying to bring her back?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Marinette\u2019s eyebrows furrowed in confusion, \u201cWhat do you mean bring her back?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien looked at her earnestly, \u201cIf my father is hawkmoth, why does he want our miraculous so bad? I mean, he\u2019s never mentioned world domination or anything like that before, but you said if our miraculous are combined, the wearer can make a wish, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo what if he\u2019s going to wish mom was still alive?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette\u2019s eyes widened and she nodded numbly, \u201cThat...would make a lot of sense.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI know, right?\u201dAdrien jumped up, \u201cOf course he\u2019d want to bring Mom back!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette looked at him hesitantly, \u201cBut...Adrien...it\u2019s not that simple, the wish comes with a price, you can\u2019t get something for nothing and to bring back a human life\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien sat down heavily on the chaise as the implication hit him, \u201cA life would have to be taken. My dad is planning murder.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette wanted to lie. She wanted to say that maybe his father didn\u2019t know the cost, but the truth was that if he\u2019d somehow learned about the wish, he definitely knew what that wish would cost. She sat down beside him and put her arm around his shoulders, \u201cIf it\u2019s really him, then, yeah, probably.\u201d She sighed, \u201cWe could just be chasing shadows, but if he is Hawkmoth, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019s killed someone. People have died during akuma attacks before.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien swallowed, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for your cure, Hawkmoth would probably be one of the most dangerous mass murderers in history\u2026 didn\u2019t they estimate that Siren alone killed over half of Paris?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette nodded, \u201cHawkmoth isn\u2019t afraid to manipulate or even kill to get what he wants. It\u2019s also safe to say that even if we were to try to reason with him, he\u2019s too far gone to listen.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien drew a shaky breath, \u201cWe have to catch him.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette held him a little tighter, \u201cWe will kitty, I promise.\u201d\n\n\nLila put on her best doe eyes as she pulled out her phone to show Alya the pictures, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just terrible Alya! The famous designer Jules Bisset incorporates a hidden signature into his work and has for decades. I can\u2019t believe that Marinette would stoop so low as to steal another designer\u2019s idea!\u201d\n\n\nAlya was practically vibrating in fury, \u201cAnd then she got after Chloe for doing the same thing she did herself! I can\u2019t believe that girl! She was just trying to impress Mr. Agreste to get to Adrien!\u201d\n\n\nLila hid her smirk under a look of fake pity, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Alya. It\u2019s so terrible when people disappoint you.\u201d\n\n\nShe discreetly looked around the classroom and reveled in the outraged looks of her classmates. She\u2019d made sure to have this conversation when everyone \n\nbut\n\n Marinette and Adrien were around to listen in, knowing that Alya wasn\u2019t capable of being quiet, especially when her emotions got the better of her. After this, Marinette\u2019s reputation would be hanging by a thread and she wouldn\u2019t have any choice but to stay away from Adrien.\u00a0\n\n\nRight on cue, Marinette walked in the door, followed by Adrien. He\u2019d taken to waiting for her by the front doors the last few days, a fact that annoyed Lila to no end, but worked well for her plan today. Afterall, what better way to show that Marinette was stealing design ideas to get closer to Adrien than to let her walk into class with the boy.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you!\u201d Alya yelled, \u201cHow are you not ashamed of yourself?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette\u2019s eyes widened in shock and confusion while Adrien immediately glared at Lila, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d He said through gritted teeth.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI just told them how Marinette stole the idea of signing her work from another designer,\u201d Lila said innocently, \u201cWhy are you mad at me for telling the truth?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you were so mad at Chloe for stealing your hat design when you were stealing ideas all along!\u201d Alya seethed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah, not cool dude.\u201d Nino shook his head.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI-I didn\u2019t!\u201d Marinette stuttered out, \u201cI swear, I\u2019ve been inspired by other designers, but I\u2019ve never \n\nstolen \n\nfrom them!\u201d\n\n\nAdrien clenched his fists, \u201cA lot of designers sign their work! That\u2019s like saying everyone who\u2019s ever designed with lace stole it from the guy who did it first!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSettle down, class,\u201d Miss Bustier said as she walked in, \u201cdid everyone do the reading last night?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien was in the front row, so he couldn\u2019t see it, but he could practically \n\nfeel\n\n all the glares and hatred directed at Marinette for the next hour. He hated it! How could these idiots not realize how amazing Marinette was? How were they falling hook, line, and sinker for an obvious liar. It just wasn\u2019t fair! How dare they treat Marinette like that?\n\n\nAs soon as class was over, Marinette walked calmly out of the room for break. Adrien followed her to an empty classroom a few hallways over. He closed the door behind them and went to hug her.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d\n\n\nShe nodded, \u201cI\u2019m used to it by now.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien saw red, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to be \n\nused to it\n\n!\u201d he yelled. He decreased his volume when Marinette flinched, \u201cIt\u2019s just you\u2019re amazing and no one gets to treat my lady like this. You don\u2019t deserve any of this!\u201d\n\n\nMarinette got a scared look on her face and Adrien looked behind him, only to rear back when he saw the purple butterfly. He shoved Marinette away, mind racing as he considered if it was possible to somehow destroy the butterfly before it reached her, but to his surprise, the butterfly didn\u2019t change course, instead continuing it\u2019s flight directly toward him.\n\n\n\u201cAdrien, it\u2019s going for you! You need to calm down!\u201d\n\n\nAdrein was hyperventilating. Was he really about to be akumatized?\n\n\n\u201cTrust me, Kitty! Take a deep breath in with me, then out. In, out!\u201d\n\n\nAdrien followed her voice on instinct, letting her guide him through a breathing exercise as the akuma stopped advancing, then slowly started fluttering away. As soon as it was gone, Adrien collapsed as soon as it was gone and Marinette ran to him and threw her arms around him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHey, kitty,\u201d She said softly as she wiped a few tears from his cheeks, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be ok. You did it.\u201d\n\n\nThey sat there for a few minutes until a loud alarm sounded, \u201cAkuma Alert. Akuma Alert. Please evacuate the building. Ladybug and Chat Noir are expected to resolve the situation shortly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGuess that\u2019s our cue, kitty.\u201d Marinette gave him a small smile and he nodded and transformed.\u00a0\n\n\nHonestly, he didn\u2019t know how Marinette had been doing this for months. He didn\u2019t want to fight an akuma right now.\u00a0\n\n\n//\n\n\nAlya was already filming when Ladybug and Chat Noir arrived, \u201cHey lady bloggers! It seems like Hawkmoth is really scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one. It appears that this akuma \n\nreally\n\n wants to tie everyone\u2019s shoelaces together.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBe careful, Alya!\u201d Chat Noir said with a strained smile, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want you to \n\ntrip us up!\n\n\u201d\n\n\nLadybug rolled her eyes, \u201cSeriously, Chat? Shouldn\u2019t you be more worried about how we\u2019re going to \n\ntie this up?\n\n\u201d\n\n\nChat gasped in delight, \u201cMilady! I thought you were too straight-laced\n\n for puns!\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLadybug, Chat Noir! I am Lacey! Give me your miraculouses or I will tie your shoelaces together!\u201d\n\n\nBoth heroes looked down at their feet, then back at the akuma.\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Chat said slowly, \u201cI think you\u2019re gonna need to find a different threat.\u201d\n\n\nLadybug giggled, \u201cSilly kitty!\u201d\n\n\nHe raised his hands in surrender, \u201cHey, I\u2019m not the one who forgot neither of us have shoelaces!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Lacey shot a series of shoe laces at them like whips, but the heroes just dodged out of the way.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThe akuma\u2019s in her shoelaces?\u201d Chat asked.\n\n\nLadybug shrugged, \u201cProbably, but it\u2019ll be difficult to get close enough to destroy them without getting grabbed.\u201d\n\n\nHe smiled at her, \u201cThen I guess I better \n\naglet \n\nyou take care of it!\u201d\n\n\nLadybug groaned and dodged another attack from the akuma\u2019s shoelaces before throwing her yoyo in the air, \u201cLucky Charm!\u201d\n\n\nA roll of fly tape dropped into her hands and she looked around. She grabbed one end of the tape and threw the main roll to Chat.\n\n\n\u201cKitty! Pretend you\u2019re chasing a laser pointer!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d Chat cried indignantly, but started running around at random, pulling out more and more of the tape as he did so. Every time Lacey tried to catch him in her shoelaces, he\u2019d dodge at the last minute and the laces would get caught on the tape. Within minutes, the shoelaces were nothing more than a tangled mess.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell, I guess you\u2019re all \n\ntied up\n\n.\u201d Chat smirked at Ladybug, who smiled and rolled her eyes. \u201cCataclysm!\u201d The shoelaces dissolved away into nothing and ladybug caught the butterfly as it tried to fly away.\n\n\n\u201cNo more evil doing for you, little akuma!\u201d She smiled and waved, \u201cBye bye, little butterfly!\u201d\n\n\nChat smiled widely at her and held out a fist, \u201cPound it!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLadybug! Chat Noir!\u201d Alya yelled, \u201cWould you mind answering a few questions?\u201d\n\n\nChat bristled, but Ladybug just placed a hand on his shoulder, \u201cSure, we still have a few minutes before we change back.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk!\u201d Alya held her phone out in front of her,.\u201cSo it seemed like you two were super in sync today! Is there any reason for that?\u201d\n\n\nLadybug and Chat looked at each other. The real reason was because they\u2019d finally revealed their identities, but they couldn\u2019t say that.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s just say we\u2019ve been getting to know each other better lately.\u201d Chat wiggled his eyebrows suggestively and Ladybug cuffed him over the head as he laughed.\u00a0\n\n\nAlya\u2019s eyes took on a wicked gleam, \u201cDoes this mean that LadyNoir is closer to being a reality?\u201d\n\n\nLadybug sighed, \u201cI\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s never going to happen, but for right now, our focus is on finding Hawkmoth and bringing him to justice. Now if you\u2019ll excuse us, it\u2019s time for us to leave.\u201d\n\n\nShe grabbed Chat by the hand, who looked like he was over the moon, and they both vaulted away. Alya turned her camera around so her viewers could see her face, \u201cThere you have it guys!\u201d She said with a wide smile, \u201cYou heard it here first! Ladybug is totally open to a relationship with Chat Noir. Here\u2019s hoping they catch Hawkmoth soon so they can \n\nget together already!\n\n This is the Ladyblogger, signing off!\u201d\n\n\nAdrien snuck out the night of the akuma attack and made his way to Marinettes. He peeked into her room to make sure her parents weren\u2019t there before dropping down onto the bed and detransforming. He shot a quick text to Tom that he\u2019d arrived and jumped off her bed, landing in a crouch on the floor below.\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette shook her head, \u201cYou know, not every movement needs to be a production.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien smiled, \u201cBut it\u2019s so much more \n\nfun\n\n that way, princess!\u201d\n\n\nMarinette sighed, but smiled, \u201cSo are you ready to look at the camera feeds from this morning?\u201d\n\n\nHe looked at her, \u201cYou haven\u2019t already looked at them?\u201d\n\n\nShe shook her head and played with her hands, refusing to meet his eyes, \u201cI wanted to wait for you. You know, just in case\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe exhaled slowly, \u201cYeah. I get it. Let\u2019s just get this over with. It\u2019s the not knowing that\u2019s killing me.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette nodded and pulled up the camera feeds, \u201cThe akuma showed up around 10:00, so we should go back about a half hour? See what happens?\u201d\n\n\nShe synced it up and started playing the videos at double speed from about 9:30 that morning. She slowed them down to normal speed when she saw Gabriel enter his office at about 9:40. Instead of sitting down at his desk to design, he went to stand in front of the large portrait of Adrein\u2019s mother.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the safe with the spell book was, right?\u201d Marinette asked. Adrein nodded.\u00a0\n\n\nGabriel pressed a few panels in the painting, activating a hidden elevator beneath his feet. Marinette looked to Adrien, who simply held up his hands, \u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me, I had no idea that was there!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe floor closed again as soon as Gabriel was gone and they waited. According to the video live-streamed to the ladyblog, Marinette had finally cleansed the Akuma around 10:45, so they played the video at double speed until a few minutes before then. At 10:50, Gabriel finally reappeared in his office. He loosened his tie slightly and sat down heavily at his desk with his head in his hands.\u00a0\n\n\nNatalie came in almost immediately and looked at him softly, \u201cIt didn\u2019t work?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou already know it didn\u2019t work!\u201d Gabriel snapped. \u201cIt never works.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nNatalie went to stand behind him and put her arms around his chest, leaning her head on his shoulder, \u201cYou just need to keep trying, Gabriel. Someday Ladybug and Chat Noir will slip up and that\u2019s when you\u2019ll get them. You\u2019re smart and capable and motivated by love, so it\u2019s only a matter of time before you get the miraculous.\u201d She smiled slightly and tightened her hug, \u201cI believe in you.\u201d\n\n\nGabriel sighed and leaned his head over to rest on Natalie\u2019s, \u201cThank you, Natalie, I don\u2019t know what I would do without you.\u201d\n\n\nThe two stayed there for a few minutes before Natalie left and Gabriel got back to designing. Marinette reached over to pause the video feed, then looked at Adrien, who was staring numbly at the screen.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMy own father tried to akumatized me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAdrien\u2026\u201d Marinette said softly. He turned to look at her desperately.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMy own father, Marinette! He was willing to \n\nuse\n\n me and turn me, \n\nhis own son\n\n, into a villain!\u201d He stood to pace around the room. \u201cDo you realize how messed up that is? At least before, I could say that he didn\u2019t know he was hurting me because he didn\u2019t know I was Chat Noir, but today he tried to akumatize me \n\nknowing\n\n that I was his son. That\u2019s not even counting all the times I\u2019ve been actively targeted by akumas or even the times I was collateral damage. He \n\nknows\n\n what he\u2019s doing is hurting people, he knows it\u2019s hurting \n\nme\n\n and he\u2019s still doing it!\u201d Adrien paused, and looked at Marinette, \u201cDo you think he even cares about me at all?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette opened and closed her mouth a few times. What was she supposed to say in this situation?\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Adrien,\u201d She said tearfully. \u201cI want to say that he\u2019s your father, so of course he loves you, but...I\u2019m sorry. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien ran his hands through his hair, \u201cWould you mind watching for akumas?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette nodded and moved to the chaise, allowing Adrien to sit down beside her and rest his head in her lap. She played with his hair and kept watch as he cried. At one point her parents had poked their heads in, but Marinette had simply shaken her head and they left quickly. It was pretty late by the time that Adrien wiped the tears off this face and transformed, promising to talk to her tomorrow.\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette walked down to the kitchen, where her parents were busy cleaning up. When Sabine saw her, she threw open her arms and Marinette ran to her, crying in her mother\u2019s arms.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIs Adrien already gone, sweetie?\u201d She asked softly.\n\n\nMarinette nodded into her mother\u2019s chest.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDid he say what he was upset about?\u201d Tom asked, \u201cIs there any way we can help?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette took a deep breath, \u201cAdrien\u2019s father isn\u2019t a good dad. He only sees Adrien about once a month and those times are usually just to scold him. It sucks and it\u2019s part of the reason he sneaks out and comes here. Lately though\u2026 it's been getting worse, I think. If something happens...well, I don\u2019t know, but if things keep going the way they are Adrien might not be safe at home anymore.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette\u2019s parents looked at each other silently for a long minute, then led Marinette over to the kitchen table, where they all sat down.\u00a0\n\n\nTom placed his hand over Marinette\u2019s, \u201cWhat would you like us to do, sweetie?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI,\u201d She hesitated, was she asking too much? \u201cI\u2019d like to register our family in the foster system. We don\u2019t have to really do anything, if you don\u2019t want to, but I want to make sure that Adrien has a safe place to go if he ever needs it. Does that make sense?\u201d\n\n\nTom and Sabine shared a look before nodding. Sabine hugged her daughter, \u201cAdrien is always welcome here. You\u2019re a really good friend to him, Marinette.\u201d\n\n\nTom nodded, \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of you, sweetie.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette sniffed as she started to cry, \u201cThanks. You guys are amazing.\u201d\n\n\nTom smiled, \u201cWell, now that that\u2019s decided, how about I make us some hot chocolate?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette laughed and nodded. Adrien would be ok.\u00a0\n\n\nShe would make sure of it. \n\n\nAdrien had decided it was impossible to get a good night\u2019s sleep the night after you cried your guts out. Or maybe it was just impossible to get a good night\u2019s sleep the night after finding out your father was a supervillain who had knowingly tried to emotionally manipulate you and unknowingly tried to kill you. Either way, Adrien was fighting off a headache and had enough cover up under his eyes that he could practically feel it caking.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYo, dude, you ok?\u201d Nino laid a hand on his shoulder, but Adrien just grunted tiredly in response. He wasn\u2019t sure he trusted words right now.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh Adrien!\u201d Lila clung to his arm and placed the back of her hand against his forehead. \u201cAre you sick? Maybe you should take the day off! I\u2019d be happy to bring you your homework.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien hardly bothered to conceal his disgust as he pushed her away, \u201cI\u201dm fine, \n\nLila\n\n, I just didn\u2019t sleep well last night.\u201d\n\n\nShe pouted, \u201cI'm just trying to help.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien sighed and rolled his eyes, \u201cWell you can start by trusting me when I tell you I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\n\nLila glared at him for a moment before smiling, \u201cOf course, silly me! Well, I hope you get feeling better.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlright class, settle down!\u201d Miss Bustier stood up in front of the class and Lila slunk off to her seat in the back row. Adrien stared at the board, but wasn\u2019t really absorbing anything until Marinette came rushing through the door five minutes later and placed a coffee and croissant in front of him before stumbling into her own seat. Nino raised an eyebrow at him, but Adrien just shrugged and gave Marinette a half-hearted smile, which she returned with a deadpan glare, \n\nyou don\u2019t have to pretend you\u2019re alright, you know.\n\n\n\nHe let his smile fall as he turned back around and bit into the croissant. Definitely not as good as having a father who actually loved you, but Adrien figured it would have to do. He felt his phone buzz in his pocket and glanced at it under the table when Bustier turned to write something on the board.\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette\n: Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll send you my notes later.\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien nodded absently, knowing Marinette would be able to see the gesture, and allowed himself to space off. If Miss Bustier ever called on him to answer a question, he didn\u2019t know, but he couldn\u2019t really bring himself to care anyway.\n\n\nHe still wasn\u2019t listening as he packed up his bag to go to lunch, at least until he heard Lila\u2019s obnoxiously loud whisper, \u201cYeah, he texted me that Marinette was calling him all night asking for updates for something she submitted to Gabriel. I mean, I understand being anxious, I\u2019ve struggled with an anxiety disorder for years, but I\u2019m just saying her timing could be a bit better.\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien grit his teeth as he could practically \n\nfeel\n\n Marinette freeze behind him. He took a deep breath. Now was \n\nnot\n\n the time to be akumatized. \n\nNow was not the time to be akumatized\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette rushed past him, obviously pretending she hadn\u2019t heard, even though she definitely had. Everyone had, judidng by the glares her classmates gave her as she ran. Adrien simply sighed and glared at Lila before rolling his eyes and following Marinette out the door. Maybe if she went to the bakery, she would bring him something back? He almost wished they could just arrest his father already so he could go where he wanted for lunch and finally ask Lila to leave him alone.\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien\u2019s eyes widened and he stopped in his tracks. If he and Marinette arrested his father...Hawkmoth wouldn\u2019t be around to akumatize Lila. Plus, he, as the son of a supervillain, wouldn\u2019t have any reputation left to protect by keeping silent any longer. Basically, once his father was in prison, there was literally nothing keeping him from exposing her and saving Marinette.\u00a0\n\n\nFor the first time since he\u2019d seen the video yesterday, Adrien smiled sincerely. It \n\nwas \n\nhis job as Chat Noir to protect Ladybug, wasn\u2019t it?\n\n\nMarinette rubbed her eyes as she flipped through the new camera feeds. She\u2019d suspected that Adriend wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep well, but she hadn\u2019t been expecting him to text her after school telling her that he and plagg had moved around the cameras in the middle of the night. Plagg had explored the secret entrance and discovered that there were actually two lairs, so of the five total cameras they had, Adrien had decided to put two in each lair and leave the one they\u2019d already placed in Gabriel\u2019s office.\n\n\nOne lair was just dark, she and Adrien didn\u2019t know if it was even in use, but as much as she adjusted the quality of the second lair\u2019s feed hoping the image would change, it never did. Emilie Agreste could have passed for snow white, complete with glass coffin, and Marinette was debating what she was going to say to Adrien. She hadn\u2019t wanted them to be right about that part.\u00a0\n\n\nShe looked up at her skylight, normally Adrien would have come over by now, right? Had something happened? Had Gabriel discovered what was going on?\n\n\n\u201cMarinette!\u201d Tikki flew into her face. \u201cStop panicking! Just text Adrien and ask him if he\u2019s ok! You can even call if you need to hear his voice.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette took a deep breath, \u201cYou\u2019re right Tikki,\u201d she took out her phone, \u201cI can just Ahhh!\u201d she dropped her phone in shock as the skylight opened and Adrien dropped down.\n\n\n\u201cSorry Marinette!\u201d Adrien looked slightly panicked. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you!\u201d\n\n\nMarinette blinked a few times and shook her head, \u201cIt\u2019s no grig beal, I mean it\u2019s no big deal!\u201d She sighed. \u201cYou were just later than usual and I was about to call you because I was panicking because I didn\u2019t know if your father found out or if I was going to have to come rescue you and then we wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\n\nAdrien gripped her shoulders to steady her, \u201cI\u2019m ok, Marinette! I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late, I was just...working on a project.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette looked at him suspiciously, but he just gave his best innocent smile.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d she rolled her eyes, \u201ckeep your secrets.\u201d She fiddled with her mouse for a long moment. \u201cUmm...Adrien, about those camera feeds...\u201d\n\n\nAdrien sighed, \u201cYou mean my mother just lying there in a glass coffin? Yeah, Plagg already told me.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette gave a quiet breath of relief. She wouldn\u2019t have to be the bearer of even more bad news, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\nAdrein shrugged, \u201cWe figured it was a possibility. I just...I wish I knew how she got there, you know? Maybe it was something to do with the miraculous in the first place, or maybe she really did just get sick like Father said, but we won\u2019t know until he\u2019s behind bars. Speaking of which, we need to figure out how we\u2019re gonna take him down, Milady.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette nodded, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been thinking about a few potential strategies, it\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d\n\n\nAdrien tilted his head slightly, \u201cThat what?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s just that we need to decide if we\u2019re going to be including any other miraculous holders in the plan.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien frowned, \u201cWell Chloe\u2019s out, this plan needs to actually be kept a secret, but why wouldn\u2019t we include Carapace and Rena Rouge.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette groaned and hit her head against the desk, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien snorted unsympathetically, \u201cOur life\u2019s complicated Bugaboo, try again.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRenarougeandcarapacearealyaandnino.\u201d She grumbled.\u00a0\n\n\nAdrein raised an eyebrow at her, \u201cSorry, Bugaboo. Didn\u2019t quite catch all that.\u201d\n\n\nShe took a deep breath, \u201cNino and Alya are Carapace and Rena Rouge.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien\u2019s eyes widened for a moment as he took that info in, then he scowled, \u201cThose jerks! You trust them with miraculouses, but they won\u2019t even have your back when Lila is obviously trying to sabotage you?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette shook her head, \u201cThey don\u2019t know that I\u2019m the one that gave them their miraculous. As far as they know, they\u2019ve never given Ladybug and Chat Noir any reason to distrust them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t at least try to fact check what Lila says.\u201d Adrien grumbled. \u201cI don\u2019t think we use them, Milady. If we can\u2019t trust them to have our backs as civilians how can we trust them to have our backs as heroes?\u201d He took in her unsure expression. \u201cYou don\u2019t agree?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette bit her lip, \u201cI do! It\u2019s just...I really don\u2019t know if we can do it without them.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien thought for a moment, \u201cWe could always try to find new holders?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette groaned, \u201cBut then we\u2019d have to take the time to train them and there\u2019s the potential that Alya and Nino would be akumatized over the whole thing, which is a disaster I\u2019d really like to avoid if we can. Alya and Nino trust Ladybug and Chat, plus they already know how to use their powers.\u201d Marinette huffed. \u201cAnd if we include them, we can use the Ladyblog to our advantage.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien gestured for her to continue and she took a deep breath, \u201cWe\u2019ll be the ones taking the miraculous as soon as Hawkmoth and Mayura are unmasked. If we\u2019re not careful, it could come down to our word against theirs that they really were supervillains. But if we were to give Alya access to the camera feeds\u2026\u201d\n\n\nAdrien smiled, \u201cThen she could live stream the whole fight and there wouldn\u2019t be any doubt. You really are so amazing, Marinette.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette blushed\u00a0 and looked away, \u201cOh, shut up.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien smirked, \u201cWhy should I Bugaboo? You\u2019re the \n\ncat\u2019s meow.\n\n\u201d\n\n\nMarinette rolled her eyes, \u201cSo should I pick up the fox and turtle tomorrow so we have them ready.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien pouted, \u201cI don\u2019t have to like it, do I?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette giggled and tapped his nose, \u201cNo, silly kitty, but you do need to be able to work with them. If not, we\u2019ll never pull off what I have in mind.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d Adrien\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cAnd what exactly is that?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien and Marinette ran to the janitor\u2019s closet as soon as the akuma alert sounded. Thankfully the school was being evacuated, so they didn\u2019t look suspicious for running off, but they would need to find Alya and Nino before they got too close to the akuma.\u00a0\n\n\nThey transformed quickly and Chat paused with his hand on the door handle.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cKitty?\u201d Ladybug put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\nChat let out a long breath, \u201cIt\u2019s just...nothing\u2019s going to be the same after today.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Ladybug said softly. \u201cBut at least it\u2019ll all be over, right?\u201d\n\n\nChat nodded, \u201cBut I\u2019m going to be alone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLook at me.\u201d Ladybug said earnestly. \u201cYou are not going to be alone, Kitty. I will \n\nnever\n\n leave you, do you understand? You and me against the world, remember?\u201d\n\n\nChat took a deep breath, \u201cYou and me against the world.\u201d\n\n\nLadybug went up on her toes and kissed his cheek, \u201cAnd don\u2019t you forget it. Now let\u2019s go fight a supervillain.\u201d\n\n\nAlya dragged Nino along by the hand as they ran toward the akuma. It was a big, ugly thing with wrecking balls for hands that was wreaking havoc downtown, apparently content with destruction of property until Ladybug and Chat Noir showed up. She hadn\u2019t bothered to start recording yet, since she couldn\u2019t actually see the akuma, so she didn\u2019t have to come up with an excuse to end the stream when Ladybug and Chat Noir landed in front of them with miraculous boxes in their hands.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAlya Cesaire, Nino Lahiffe, these are the miraculouses of the fox and turtle, which grant the power of illusion and protection. When the mission is complete, you will return the miraculous to us. Do you accept?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAs always, Ladydude!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAlya put the necklace on, \u201cBut I don\u2019t really understand, this akuma seems pretty standard. Why do you need us?\u201d\n\n\nLadybug glanced at Chat Noir, \u201cBecause we\u2019re not going to be fighting the akuma.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTransform and we\u2019ll explain on the way.\u201d Chat said sharply.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAlright, no need to get your panties in a twist.\u201d Alya replied, then leaned toward Nino,\u00a0 \u201cI wonder who put bees in his bonnet?\u201d\n\n\nNino shrugged, put on his bracelet, and grinned as he and Wayzz did their little handshake, \u201cHey little dude! You ready?\u201d Wayzz nodded. \u201cAlright then, Shell on!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTrixx, let\u2019s pounce!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Chat said. \u201cFollow us.\u201d\n\n\nRena and Carapace followed Chat and Ladybug in the opposite direction of the Akuma until they stopped and crouched down on the roof of the Agreste mansion.\n\n\n\u201cUmm, Ladydude?\u201d Nino asked. \u201cWhy are we at Adrien\u2019s place?\u201d\n\n\nLadybug glanced at Chat, who nodded and turned away. There was just something so \n\noff\n\n about Chat today that Rena couldn\u2019t put her finger on.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe recently discovered that Gabriel Agreste is Hawkmoth.\u201d Ladybug said. \u201cWe need your help to bring him down.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAdrien's pops? I knew he was evil, but\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDoes Adrien know?\u201d Rena asked.\n\n\n\u201cAdrien didn\u2019t have anything to do with this!\u201d Chat growled.\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say he did.\u201d Rena said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s his dad...does he know yet?\u201d\n\n\nChat sighed, \u201cYeah, he knows. We put him someplace safe before we came and got you. Now can you two just shut up and listen to the plan?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChat..\u201d Ladybug warned.\n\n\nChat huffed, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll be civil.\u201d\n\n\nRena and Carapace exchanged a glance. What was up with him?\n\n\nLadybug turned to them and smiled, \u201cHere\u2019s the plan. We don\u2019t only need Rena Rouge the hero, we need Alya Cesaire the ladyblogger.\u201d She handed Rena a slip of paper with a series of links. \u201cThose are links to the camera feeds we have set up in Gabriel\u2019s office and one of his lairs. Can you set it up so you can live-stream the footage to the Ladyblog on your command? You might be able to do it from your flute, but it\u2019s probably better to do it from your civilian phone, since that\u2019s more familiar. We don\u2019t want any technical difficulties.\u201d\n\n\nAlya nodded and detransformed. She typed in the links and started syncing them to the Ladyblog, \u201cDo you want me to start streaming them right now?\u201d\n\n\nChat shook his head, \u201cWe\u2019ll tell you when to make each camera live. It\u2019s possible to do them separately, right?\u201d\n\n\nAlya nodded, \u201cIt\u2019ll take me a minute or so to set up, since I\u2019m not used to doing multiple live streams at a time, but don\u2019t worry, I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\n\nLadyblog smiled, \u201cYou\u2019re the best, Alya!\u201d\n\n\nAlya smiled at the praise and worked for a few more minutes until she had everything set up, ignoring all the messages from people wondering why Ladybug and Chat Noir hadn\u2019t shown up yet, \u201cI should probably send out a message to my viewers real quick before I transform so they know to be watching. Would that alright?\u201d\n\n\nChat shrugged, \u201cYou\u2019re the expert.\u201d\n\n\nAlya nodded and stood against a blank chimney so none of the heroes were in the shot and no one would be able to tell exactly where she was, \u201cHey peeps! The one and only ladyblogger here, live from Paris. I know you\u2019re all wondering what\u2019s going on, but just know that there\u2019s going to be a very special live-stream in a few minutes, so stay tuned! Ladyblog out!\u201d\n\n\nShe ended the video and transformed, keeping her civilian phone in a secret pocket beneath the tail of her costume, \u201cThere, now Paris is watching. What next?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMake the streams from the lair live.\u201d Ladybug said.\n\n\n\u201cNot the office?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nChat shook his head, \u201cNot yet. I\u2019ll give you a thumbs up when we\u2019re ready for that one.\u201d\n\n\nLadybug smirked as Alya typed the command to make the feeds live, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go have a chat with Mayura.\u201d\n\n\nNatalie refreshed her tablet one more time before striding over to Emilie\u2019s painting. She had to warn Gabriel not to detransform, then they\u2019d find a way to take care of those pesky cameras. They\u2019d also have to find some way to punish the ladyblog for publishing that footage so something like this didn\u2019t happen again.\u00a0\n\n\nSuddenly, there was a crash and Ladybug crashed through the window of Gabriel\u2019s office and knocked the tablet out of Natalie\u2019s hand, \u201cNot so fast, Mayura. Give us your miraculous!\u201d\n\n\nLadybug threw the tablet to the ground and stomped on it so Natalie wouldn\u2019t be able to tell when the office footage went live. Since Natalie didn\u2019t know there was a camera in the office and Gabriel didn\u2019t know there was a camera in the lair, the villains wouldn\u2019t bother to hide their transformations. Or at least, that\u2019s what Ladybug was counting on.\u00a0\n\n\nThe other heroes landed in the office as Ladybug as Natalie stared each other down. Chat glanced at his partner before discreetly putting one hand behind his back and giving Rena the thumbs up to publish the office feed.\n\n\nNatalie glared at Ladybug, \u201cYou kids don\u2019t know what you\u2019re up against. He won\u2019t stop, his reasons\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, we know all about his \n\nreasons\n\n.\u201d Chat hissed. \u201cBut as noble as he thinks they are, they still aren\u2019t any excuse for terrorism. Now give us the peacock.\u201d\n\n\nNatalie stared at them all coldly, \u201cDusuu, Spread my Feathers.\u201d\n\n\nMayura charged Ladybug, but Chat stepped in front of her and grabbed Mayura by the arms, flipping her over his head. Ladybug tried to grab onto Mayura\u2019s ankles with her yoyo, but Mayura flipped in midair to land behind her. Unfortunately for her, the fight was four on one and she was now backed against the wall.\u00a0\n\n\nMayura glanced at the heroes before pulling a feather from her fan and clenching it in her fist. Dark magic bubbled around it as she blew, but Ladybug didn\u2019t bother to see where it was headed before catching it in her yoyo and purifying it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh come on dude.\u201d Carapace laughed when Natalie looked surprised. \u201cYou didn\u2019t really think we were going to let you make a sentimonster, did you?\u201d\n\n\nMayura charged at him desperately, but Carapace simply aimed his shield at her face. She dodged the blow, which unfortunately left her wide open for Rena to hit her in the gut with her flute. Before Mayura could recover, Ladybug wrapped her in her yoyo string.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cChat, if you\u2019d do the honors.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGlady Milady.\u201d Chat was deadly serious as he plucked the peacock from her shirt, and put it in his pocket, forcing her to detransform. \u201cRena, take Natalie outside. The police should be here by now. They\u2019ll take care of her.\u201d\n\n\nRena nodded and grabbed Natlie roughly by the arm as Ladybug let go of her. Natalie tried to put up a fight as she was dragged away, but she started coughing once she didn\u2019t have the strength of her transformation to sustain her.\u00a0\n\n\nChat and Ladybug walked up to the painting and Chat entered the code he\u2019d memorized from the footage they\u2019d gathered in the past few weeks. There was a mechanical whirring as the painting and part of the wall behind it\u00a0 swung out, revealing a stairway winding upward to Hawkmoth\u2019s upper lair. Carapace followed them as they tiptoed up the stairs until they reached a door at the top.\u00a0\n\n\nAs Ladybug was about to open it, she glanced at Chat, \u201cAre you gonna be ok?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Chat said tightly, \u201cBut I\u2019m ready to fight. Like you said, this\u2019ll all be over soon. And I\u2019ll always have you, Milady.\u201d\n\n\nLadybug smiled and nodded, pushing open the door. Hawkmoth was standing in a patch of light from the open window and the butterflies on the floor rustled their wings as the heroes stepped into the room.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Natalie?\u201d Hawkmoth snapped, \u201cCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m busy?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid your girlfriend\u2019s kinda busy right now.\u201d Chat said. As he predicted, that pissed Gabriel off and he whirled around to stare at the heroes with rage. Good.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAre you going to come quietly HawkDude or do we get the honor of punching you in the face?\u201d Carapace asked.\u00a0\n\n\nA butterfly outline appeared around his face, \u201cDestructor! Change of plans, Ladybug and Chat Noir are here, so come to me \n\nnow!\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s our answer.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHawkmoth growled and rushed at them with his sword-cane, so Chat ran forward to meet him, wielding his staff like a sword. Hawkmoth seemed to be a little more skilled than Chat was, but he also had to deal with Ladybug trying to trip him and Carapace throwing his shield at him. After a few minutes, as he sidestepped to dodge Ladybug\u2019s yoyo, he stepped right into the path of Carapace\u2019s shield, which knocked him to the ground.\u00a0\n\n\nLadybug was about to tie him up when the wall exploded under the force of a wrecking ball, distracting the heroes long enough for Hawkmoth to get to his feet.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about this guy, dudes, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d Carapace yelled. \u201cShelter!\u201d\n\n\nA large green sphere surrounded the akuma, who started beating it with it\u2019s fists, causing it to shudder, but thankfully the shield held. Chat nodded at Carapace before turning back to Hawkmoth. Holding Shelter was going to take too much concentration for Carapace to help them now.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about time we use a little luck, Milady.\u201d\n\n\nLadybug nodded, \u201cLucky Charm!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA blanket?\u201d Chat asked. \u201cIs that a sign that we should \n\nwrap things up?\n\n\u201d\n\n\nLadybug smiled, \u201cI think that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve punned this entire fight.\u201d\n\n\nChat stopped for a moment, then smiled, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just because you\u2019re so \n\ncomforting.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Hawkmoth yelled. \u201cLadybug, Chat Noir, give me your miraculous! Maybe if you surrender now, I\u2019ll give them back after I\u2019m through with them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEven if we believed you, which we don\u2019t,\u201d Chat said, \u201cthe price of bringing back the dead is too high. You \n\nknow\n\n that Hawkmoth. Just think for a moment, do you really believe your wife would be happy with what you\u2019re doing? Emilie wouldn\u2019t want you to kill someone just so she could live!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know nothing about her!\u201d Hawkmoth growled. \u201cEmilie and I talked about this when she started feeling the effects of the Peacock. This was \n\nalways\n\n the plan!\u201d\n\n\nChat froze, \u201cS-she \n\nknew\n\n?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChat! Watch out!\u201d\n\n\nHawkmoth lunged, his sword pointed at Chat\u2019s heart, but Ladybug leaped forward to take the blow, knocking Hawkmoth to the ground as she landed on top of him.\n\n\n\u201cLadybug!\u201d\n\n\nLadybug rolled off Hawkmoth, his sword tangled harmlessly in the blanket, \u201cCome on, Kitty, do your thing.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nChat smiled, \u201cChataclysm!\u201d\n\n\nHe touched a single finger to the floor and a large crack appeared before the floor beneath Hawkmoth collapsed, trapping him up to the waist. Chat rushed forward and punched him in the nose and was rearing back for another punch when Ladybug rushed forward and held him back, \u201cIt\u2019s over, Chat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot quite,\u201d Hawkmoth growled as he tried to pry himself from the floor, but Ladybug just pinned his arms to his sides and plucked the brooch from beneath his chin.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d She said. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUmm, dudes?\u201d Carapace called. Chat and Ladybug turned to see large cracks appearing in the shield surrounding the akuma. \u201cI think we\u2019re out of time.\u201d\n\n\nDestructor slammed his wrecking balls into the shield one last time as it shattered like glass. Chat looked between Ladybug and Gabriel, \u201cYou stay here and make sure he can\u2019t get away, Milady. Carapace and I can take care of him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t forget about me!\u201d Rena called out as she appeared at the top of the stairs. \u201cNatalie is safely in custody, so I\u2019m ready to fight!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood! Quick! Cast illusions of all of us so Destructor doesn\u2019t know which ones are real!\u201d\n\n\nRena played a few notes and the room was filled with duplicates as Destructor waved his arms around trying to destroy as many as he could. Ladybug caught Chat\u2019s eye and glanced down toward the blanket that had fallen to the floor. Chat nodded and scooped up the blanket, flinging it in Destructor\u2019s face.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCarapace! Use your shield to destroy the chain on his right wrecking ball, it\u2019s a slightly different color than the rest of him!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWill do Ladydude!\u201d Carapace slammed his shield into the chain a few times until it snapped and the akuma came flying out.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll hold onto Hawkmoth, Ladybug.\u201d Rena ran over and grabbed Gabriel\u2019s arms. \u201cYour turn.\u201d\n\n\nLadybug nodded and flung her yoyo, \u201cTime to de-evilize!\u201d\n\n\nDark magic bubbled around Destructor as Ladybug purified the akuma, revealing a little boy with a broken toy truck, \u201cWhat? Ladybug?\u201d\n\n\nThey were interrupted by a chorus of beeps. Carapace grabbed the blanket and tossed it to Ladybug, who immediately threw it in the air, \u201cMiraculous Ladybug!\u201d\n\n\nChat pulled Gabriel roughly to his feet as the floor repaired beneath him, \u201cCome on, Gabriel, time to go.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThey all jumped out the large window of the lair and landed in front of Officer Roger who was waiting for them outside along with a fleet of police cars.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOfficer, this is\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe know Ladybug, we were watching the stream.\u201d Roger smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of things from here. You four are about to detransform.\u201d\n\n\nLadybug nodded gratefully as Roger handcuffed Gabriel and forced him into the car. Another round of beeps reminded them of how little time they had left and Chat led the way to the nearest alley. Carapace\u2019s transformation fell as soon as they were out of sight.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat was crazy, dudes.\u201d Nino said as he handed the bracelet back. \u201cNot at all what I expected this morning.\u201d\n\n\nAlya detransformed as well and paused before handing the necklace back, \u201cWill we ever see you guys again?\u201d\n\n\nChat and Ladybug looked at each other as their miraculous beeped again.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll run into each other eventually.\u201d Chat said finally.\u00a0\n\n\nAlya and Nino nodded as Chat and Ladybug jumped onto the rooftops and ran as fast as they could. They reached Marinette\u2019s roof right as their transformations ran out. Marinette held open the sky light for Adrien, then dropped down after him.\u00a0\n\n\nAs soon as she landed, Adrien wrapped his arms around her and started sobbing. \n\n\nEventually, there was a quiet knock on the trapdoor and Marinette\u2019s parents slowly opened it, concern written on both their faces. Adrien hurriedly sat up so that he wasn\u2019t sprawled all over their daughter like a heathen and wiped his eyes frantically, even though he knew it probably wouldn\u2019t do any good. He\u2019d probably look like a puffy tomato for the next few weeks. His publicist would probably kill him if there was any chance he would be on any magazine covers besides tabloids in the coming months.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe thought you two were probably up here.\u201d Tom said softly. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be grateful that a teenage boy developed a habit of sneaking into my daughter\u2019s room, but here we are!\u201d\n\n\nAdrien couldn\u2019t help the wet snort that bubbled up at Tom\u2019s lame attempt at humor, \u201cWith all due respect sir, I think you were more grateful to have someone new to eat all your leftover pastries.\u201d\n\n\nTom gave a small chuckle, \u201cOh no! You caught me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad we can give you someplace to come, Adrien..\u201d Sabine said seriously. \u201cI take it you\u2019ve already heard the news?\u201d\n\n\nAdrein\u2019s breath left him and Marinette squeezed his hand as she nodded, \u201cDoes anyone else know he\u2019s here?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe never told anyone about him coming over to see you.\u201d Sabine replied. \u201cSo unless you two told your school friends, then no.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette nodded thoughtfully, \u201cOk. We should probably let the police know where he is, though, so they don\u2019t think he was kidnapped or a conspirator.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien\u2019s stomach sank. Talking to the police seemed so overwhelming, but he knew his lady was right. It was probably better to get it over with as soon as possible, before things started to feel more...real. Right now, everything just felt like a bad dream, like he\u2019d wake up in Marinette\u2019s arms on a random rooftop at any moment as she made fun of him for falling asleep on patrol again. But talking to the police about his father being Hawkmoth meant that these past few weeks had actually happened, and that his life really had crashed down around his ears.\u00a0\n\n\nHe felt Marinette squeeze his hand again and he glanced up at her to see her looking at him with concern, \u201cWould you rather wait? We can just tell them to come back another day once you\u2019ve had time to process.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien shook his head, \u201cNo, I just want this whole thing to be over.\u201d\n\n\nSabine gave a determined nod, \u201cWell, then, there\u2019s no reason for you to talk to them on an empty stomach, is there?\u201d\n\n\nTom nodded in agreement, \u201cWe\u2019ll whip something up and then you can talk to those cops afterwards, ok?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien felt more tears prickle at the sides of his eyes as he nodded gratefully. Tom and Sabine gave him soft smiles as they headed back down the stairs, leaving the trapdoor open as an invitation to follow when they were ready. Adrien was about to fall right back into Marinette\u2019s arms when he realized that his breakdown had completely messed up the nicely made covers and his tears had left wet spots all over both the bedspread and Marinette and he grimaced with embarrassment.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMaybe we should go downstairs?\u201d He suggested hesitantly. \u201cI mean, we both went through...a lot...so maybe it\u2019d be nice to have your parents around. They\u2019re, uh\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood at lightening the mood?\u201d Marinette smiled. \u201cMaybe if you want, I might even hold back my groans when you and my dad start punning.\u201d\n\n\nAdrein grinned slightly, \u201cAwww, but your reactions are half the fun!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI knew it!\u201d Marinette put a hand on her forehead dramatically and leaned against his side. \u201cYour only purpose in life is to annoy me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Adrien stood, grabbing Marinette\u2019s hand. \u201cMy purpose in life is to protect you, just like you protect me.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette blushed and Adrien hesitated. Yeah, he\u2019d declared his love for Ladybug plenty of times, but after everything, Marinette probably wasn\u2019t in the mood for that kind of declaration and Adrien wasn\u2019t even close to being in the right state of mind to make one.\u00a0\n\n\nWhich meant it was time to crack another joke, \u201cPlagg\u2019s purpose in life is to annoy me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d The kwami flew out of his pocket and crossed his little arms in front of Adrien\u2019s face. \u201cMy purpose in life is to enjoy all the wonderful cheeses you humans have to offer. Annoying you is just a nice little side bonus.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette and Adrien laughed and finally got out of the bed. Marinette led him down the stairs to the living room, where to his surprise, the tv was playing the news. The volume was kept low so it wouldn\u2019t bother the two while they were in Marinette\u2019s room, but it was loud enough that Tom and Sabine could hear it from the kitchen. They were probably keeping it on as background noise so they could know everything that was happening with Hawkmoth.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201c...currently in custody. Other members of the staff are undergoing police interrogation to determine if they had anything to do with Agreste\u2019s plots. Back to you, Nadja.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThank you. Don\u2019t be bemused, it\u2019s just the news! If you\u2019re just tuning in, we\u2019re discussing Hawkmoth\u2019s identity and capture. Hawkmoth, Paris\u2019s own resident supervillain who has been brainwashing citizens for over a year now and turning them into Akumas, was revealed today to be none other than Gabriel Agreste. The acclaimed fashion designer has been widely regarded as a recluse and a misanthrope, but I think I speak for all of Paris when I say that we never expected him to go this far. Ladybug and Chat Noir, together with Rena Rouge and Carapace, apprehended Agreste and his associate Natalie Sancour, A.K.A. Mayura, just over twenty minutes ago at the Agreste Mansion. Whereabouts of Mr. Agreste\u2019s son, the famous model Adrien Agreste, are still unknown, as is Adrien\u2019s involvement in the Hawkmoth terrorist plots that have plagued our city for the past year.\u201d\n\n\nBeside him, Marinette was practically buzzing with anger, \u201cWhy are they acting like you had something to do with it?! If it wasn\u2019t for you\u2026\u201d\n\n\nAdrien shut her up by resting his head on her shoulder and nuzzling into ther neck, \u201cIt\u2019s fine Marinette. It\u2019s a natural reaction and it\u2019ll all get cleared up when we talk to the police later. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette frowned at him for a long moment before sighing, \u201cWe can turn this off, you know. You don\u2019t have to listen to it.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien shook his head, \u201cNo, I want to know what people are saying about him. I...I have to know.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette\u2019s eyes glistened with understanding as she put an arm around his shoulders and pulled him in closer to her so that he was basically wrapped in a hug as they sat and watched the news replay the clips of his father transforming that they\u2019d pulled from the ladyblog. It was still just as hard to watch it as he\u2019d expected it to be, but watching it from Marinette\u2019s arms felt almost safe. It was like he could handle anything with his lady beside him. Maybe that was what Master Fu had meant by them being Yin and Yang.\u00a0\n\n\nThey left the TV on during dinner. Both Tom and Sabine had offered to turn it off, but in a way he couldn\u2019t explain, Adrien felt like he \n\nhad \n\nto watch. Maybe he was just trying to punish himself again for not seeing his father\u2019s villainy sooner, but it didn\u2019t feel like that was quite right. It was almost like he would only be able to control the situation if he didn\u2019t avoid it.\u00a0\n\n\nAs expected, the media were digging into every interaction his father had had with the public over the past decade, even before his mother disappeared, and were wasting no time in vilifying him, Natalie, and even Adrien\u2019s mother, even though she\u2019d never been \n\ndirectly\n\n involved in Hawkmoth\u2019s reign of terror. Apparently a few of the most intrepid reporters had already uncovered a few instances outside of Paris where the butterfly and the moth could have been active, almost all of which coincided with \n\nbusiness trips\n\n that the Agrestes had taken.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t notice.\u201d Adrien said numbly. Normally, he\u2019d be devouring the Dupain-Cheng\u2019s cooking like it was life itself, but today he had found himself picking at the same piece of broccoli for a full five minutes.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAdrien\u2026\u201d Marinette said. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself for your father\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just my father, princess.\u201d Adrien said, finally giving up and just putting his fork back on his plate. \u201cIn all the memories I have of my mother, she was \n\nkind.\n\n Maybe that was just because I was comparing her to Father, but at least Mom was around. I don\u2019t know if I didn\u2019t see it because I just didn\u2019t know what was going on or if I \n\ndid\n\n see it, but then because she went missing, I didn\u2019t want to think bad about her and created this idealized version of her in my head!\u201d\n\n\nHe hadn\u2019t realized just how agitated he\u2019d gotten until Marinette grabbed his hand tightly, giving him an apparently much needed anchor point. He took a deep breath to steady himself, \u201cI just wish she\u2019d been innocent too, you know?\u201d\n\n\nSabine reached across the table and held his other hand while Tom patted Adrien\u2019s shoulder, \u201cIt\u2019s ok to grieve, son. Your parents had a responsibility to be the people you needed them to be, but instead\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey neglected me.\u201d Adrien finished. \u201cLooking back now, I mean, it should have been obvious. Mom never stood up to Father and insisted I be allowed outside the house, or allowed to make friends, or even allowed to choose what I was going to wear! If she\u2019d been as perfect as I remember her...well, I guess there\u2019s no use in thinking about it, is there?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAdrien,\u201d Sabine and Tom shared a look, \u201cthere\u2019s something we wanted to talk to you about. We don\u2019t want you to be alone and\u2026\u201d\n\n\nShe was interrupted by a knock and everyone at the table shared a look before Adrien took a deep breath as he stood and answered the door.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHello Officer Raincomprix.\u201d Adrien gave a small, sad smile that didn\u2019t reach even close to his eyes. \u201cI heard you had a few questions for me.\u201d\n\n\nOfficer Raincomprix walked in, followed by a detective that Adrien hadn\u2019t ever interacted with except as Chat Noir. Adrein looked as the Dupain-Chengs hesitantly, but Sabine simply smiled at him softly and led the group into the living room, \u201cIt\u2019s sweet of you to show up so Adrein has a familiar face, Officer Raincomprix. This is going to be hard enough on him without having to confide in strangers, you know? Can I get you anything? Cookies? Coffee?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d The detective said quickly. He looked between Adrien and the Dupain-Chengs, \u201cAdrein, would you prefer...this family to be here during the interrogation, or would you prefer to do it with just us? It\u2019s up to you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWait, interrogation?!\u201d Tom asked incredulously. \u201cYou can\u2019t seriously be thinking of treating a \n\nchild\n\n like a criminal, can you?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok. My father \n\nwas\n\n a supervillain after all.\u201d Something about having the police here was oddly calming, not in a peaceful sort of way, but more like Adrein was able to focus now that he had a task to accomplish. Maybe it was that that he was so used to interacting with law enforcement as a superhero...or maybe it was just that the anticipation and anxiety of waiting for this conversation had been worse than he\u2019d been letting himself admit, especially since he\u2019d known this would happen since he and Marinette had first looked at that map. \u201cIf it\u2019s all the same to you, I\u2019d like the Dupain-Chengs to stay. They\u2019re more like parents to me than my Father ever was.\u201d\n\n\nTom wiped tears from his eyes while Sabine looked at him proudly and Marinette squeezed his hand from where she sat beside him on the couch. Adrein took a deep breath and turned to face the detectives, \u201cSo, what would you like to know?\u201d\n\n\nThe detective took a small notebook from his pocket and flipped it open, \u201cFirst off, did you know that your father was Hawkmoth.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette\u2019s parents gasped and the detective\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cC-could you repeat that?\u201d\n\n\nAdrein squeezed Marinette\u2019s hand for comfort, \u201cI didn\u2019t know from the beginning, but Marinette and I figured out his identity a few weeks ago by tracking the akumas that were targeting her. We took our suspicions to Ladybug and Chat Noir, who confirmed them and took them down.\u201d\n\n\nThe adults stared at the two in shock for a long moment before Officer Raincomprix cleared his throat, \u201cWell, I guess we have you to thank for today\u2019s good news, then. Marinette, how did you track the akumas?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette nodded frantically and jumped up, running to her room. There was a series of concerning crashes from upstairs before she ran back into the room with her repurposed sketchbook in one hand and their map in the other. The map ended up catching on the end table as she ran, which sent her sprawling on the floor. Adrien winced and stood to help her up, but true to form, she simply jumped right back to her feet and spread the map out on the coffee table for everyone to see before opening up her sketchbook to the tables she\u2019d created and handing it to the detective.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThings at school...haven\u2019t been great.\u201d Marinette started.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMarinette\u2026\u201d Sabine said softly, but Marinette just plowed on, avoiding her parents\u2019 eyes.\n\n\n\u201cI was able to calm down quickly enough to not get akumatized, but after the first few, I started keeping track of them, hoping that I could get enough data to be able to track down Hawkmoth, since things didn\u2019t seem to be getting better anyway.\u201d She explained. \u201cI did that for a while, and when I finally felt like I had enough, I recruited Adrein to help me, since I wasn\u2019t confident in being able to do the calculations myself.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we made that map.\u201d Adrien took over. \u201cWhich...wasn\u2019t fun. Or I mean, it was fun! Until we saw the final results. When we showed it to the heroes, they asked us not to tell anyone else because they didn\u2019t want Hawkmoth to retaliate against us for trying to find him, \n\nespecially\n\n if we were correct.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is that you were unaware of Hawkmoth\u2019s true identity until a few weeks ago?\u201d Officer Raincomprix asked. \u201cAnd once you \n\ndid\n\n know, you immediately took that information to the heroes?\u201d\n\n\nBoth Marinette and Adrein nodded, \u201cI also didn\u2019t know about Natalie\u2019s involvement, but that was pretty obvious once we figured out Father. The only real surprise was Mom.\u201d\n\n\nThe police shared a look before Officer Raincomprix cleared his throat awkwardly, \u201cAbout your mother\u2026\u201d\n\n\nAdrien gripped Marinette\u2019s hand so tightly that he\u2019d be worried about hurting her if she wasn\u2019t a superhero, \u201cLadybug and Chat Noir already told me about the set up in the basement. Do you know if she\u2019ll ever recover?\u201d\n\n\nOfficer Raincomprix shook his head sadly, \u201cThe contraption that was keeping her alive was obviously powered by some kind of magic connected to Hawkmoth\u2019s miraculous, so once that was taken away\u2026\u201d\n\n\nAdrien felt a wave of cold dread and guilt wash over him, \u201cS-she\u2019s dead?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d The detective said. \u201cBut after so long being kept alive through magical means...the doctors said that her body is rejecting traditional life support. There\u2019s not much they can do.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien drew in a shaky gasp of breath, \u201cOh...Okay.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay?\u201d Officer Raincomprix looked at him in disbelief. \u201cYour mother is dying, Adrien, you\u2019re\u00a0 allowed to say a little more than just okay!\u201d\n\n\nSabine silenced him with a cold glare, \u201cOfficer, if you are going to shame this boy after what has already been an emotionally devastating day, then you are more than free to leave.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d The detective held up his hands placatingly. \u201cWe would like to continue, if that\u2019s alright?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien nodded, \u201cWhat next?\u201d\n\n\nThey spent the next hour asking Adrien all sorts of questions about his father and Natalie\u2019s behavior and would have probably spent longer if it weren\u2019t for the fact that it quickly became apparent that Adrien wasn\u2019t the expert they\u2019d been expecting. They had seemed shocked to hear just how little he saw of his father and that even Natalie had only interacted with him enough to give him his schedule and make sure he obeyed his father\u2019s orders. By the time they were wrapping things up, the two were looking at him with a lot more pity than suspicion, and Adrien couldn\u2019t decide if that was better or worse. At least Marinette understood.\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d the detective shuffled through his notebook one final time to make sure there weren\u2019t any questions he\u2019d missed, \u201cI believe that\u2019s all the questions we had for you, but there is still one issue that needs to be addressed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d Tom asked protectively.\n\n\nThe detective sighed, \u201cAdrien\u2019s living situation. Due to their status as supervillains and their obvious flight risk, Gabriel Agreste and Natalie Sancour have been denied bail. Now, we have already talked to the elder Mr. Agreste\u2019s lawyers and, according to his will, if anything were to happen to him, Ms. Sancour would receive sole custody of Adrien. As that is obviously not a possibility in this case, it leaves us at a bit of a loss. Adrien\u2019s bodyguard has expressed a desire to take him in, but due to his financial connections with Gabriel Agreste, the state wants to be absolutely certain he had nothing to do with Hawkmoth\u2019s reign of terror before transferring Adrien into his care, which may not happen until the case is concluded with could take months.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo...you\u2019re saying I don\u2019t have anywhere to go?\u201d Adrien had been expecting this. He knew that arresting his father would lead to him losing everything, but he still had had a duty to save Paris. It wasn\u2019t that big of a sacrifice, all things considered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just throwing you out on the streets, Adrien.\u201d Officer Raincomprix said kindly. \u201cBut, unfortunately, it does mean that you\u2019ll have to be transferred into the foster care system as soon as possible. We can\u2019t just let a fourteen year old crash on his friends\u2019 couches for months or years at a time.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien nodded numbly, \u201cI understand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat if one of his friends was already qualified to foster him?\u201d Sabine asked with a smile.\n\n\nMarinette giggled as Adrien turned and looked at her with wide eyes, \u201cR-really?\u201d\n\n\nSabine nodded, \u201cMarinette came to us weeks ago and told us things weren\u2019t going great at home. We assumed that she meant the neglect not...well, anyway, we\u2019re just waiting on the final approval to become official foster parents and we would be more than happy to take him in, either until his bodyguard receives permission to foster him or until he can emancipate himself.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien held his breath as the detective thought for a long moment, until finally he sighed and looked at him, \u201cAdrien, do you feel safe here?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien nodded frantically, \u201cYes!\u201d He grinned sheepishly and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI mean...Marinette\u2019s my best friend and, well, I \n\ndid\n\n come here first thing as soon as the news broke about my father, so...I\u2019d like to stay here, if the Dupain-Chengs are willing to have me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re willing to have you son!\u201d Tom clapped him on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s the least we can do for our daughter\u2019s best friend!\u201d\n\n\nThe detective nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll put the word in with family services and see if we can rush that final approval then. Until that comes through, Adrien, you\u2019re more than welcome to stay here, just so long as we can check in with you periodically to make sure you\u2019re safe.\u201d\n\n\nHe nodded and the Dupain-Chengs walked the police to the door, leaving Adrien alone with Marinette on the couch. As soon as they were out of sight, his composure fell and Adrien found himself gathering Marinette in his arms and nuzzling into her shoulder like a touch-starved cat, \u201cYou really asked your parents to foster me? I...it\u2019s too much!\u201d\n\n\nMarinette chuckled and started running her fingers through her hair, \u201cWe\u2019re partners, Kitty. I wasn\u2019t about to leave you to fend for yourself just so we could arrest your father!\u201d\n\n\nAdrein grinned, \u201cI guess you\u2019re still taking care of me even after Hawkmoth is gone, huh, Milady?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette smiled and ruffled his hair, \u201cAlways.\u201d\n\n\nSaying that returning to school had been rough would be putting it lightly. Having been a model his whole life, Adrien was used to being the center of attention, but that attention had mostly been positive. He was used to people being in love with him, he was used to people telling him he was such a sweet boy, he was used to people thinking he was perfect.\u00a0\n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t used to pity.\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette stayed by his side like an attack dog, or an attack bug rather, despite the rumors that Lila had been spreading about her \n\ntaking advantage of him in his vulnerable state.\n\n He wasn\u2019t really expecting any of their friends to come to her defense, but there had been a small part of him hoping that Nino and Alya would finally see the truth. The only upside of everyone in his life betraying him was that it had made it clear who he could \n\ntruly\n\n rely on: the Dupain-Chengs.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter weeks of sneaking into Marinette\u2019s room, the transition to living in the same house wasn\u2019t nearly as difficult as he\u2019d been expecting. Sure, the house was smaller, but there weren\u2019t constant schedules and suffocating expectations and for the first time in his life, he was actually living somewhere that felt like \n\nhome.\n\n The Gorilla had been by a few times already and Tom had insisted that he come to dinner at least once a week and was basically starting to pull him in as a member of the family, which was sweet. It was nice to have people behind him and people that he could stand behind. It made what he was about to do a lot easier.\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien had gone over all his drafts last night to make sure everything was ready for today and Marinette had raised her eyebrows at his suspiciously when she saw him take out his phone for the upteenth time that day, but he\u2019d simply smiled in a way that said, \n\ntrust me,\n\n and turned his attention back to Mrs. Mendaleive after pressing \n\npost\n\n for the final time about twenty minutes before lunch. The teachers let his distraction slide today because of everything, but everyone else had been too busy with class to check their notifications, just like he wanted.\u00a0\n\n\nBy the time the bell rang and everyone filtered into the halls, Adrien\u2019s official social media account had hundreds of thousands of notifications and it was too late for anyone to make him take it back or sweep it under the rug. He put a hand around Marinette\u2019s waist and led her toward the lunchroom, \u201cHey, let\u2019s eat here today?\u201d\n\n\nShe narrowed her eyes, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you? You\u2019ve been acting weird all day.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI just wanted to switch things up.\u201d Adrien blinked innocently. \u201cIs a cat not allowed to learn new tricks?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, yes.\u201d Marinette rolled her eyes. \u201cBut do you really expect me to believe\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLila!\u201d Alya said. \u201cYou\u2019re trending!\u201d\n\n\nAdrien grinned as Marinette froze, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou made sure I was taken care of after my dad was arrested.\u201d Adrien kissed the back of her hand softly. \u201cI\u2019m just returning the favor. Just sit back and watch the show.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette gave him one last suspicious glance before pulling out her phone, gasping as she scrolled through his page and saw what he\u2019d been working on for the past few weeks. Around them, people were whispering and looking over at Lila, who looked pale as she read through all of her own lies laid out for the world to see.\u00a0\n\n\nThe first post was the most dramatic, obviously, since he needed to catch everyone\u2019s attention:\n\n\n\nMany people have wondered why I haven\u2019t made an official statement in the time since my father\u2019s arrest. To tell you the truth, I have known for longer than the public has and am very grateful to Ladybug and Chat Noir for working closely with me and supporting me in this difficult time. I am safe and am currently staying with a \n\ntrue\n\n friend, but have been taking some personal time away from the public eye to deal with everything.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNow that my father is no longer holding the threat of mass destruction over Paris\u2019 head, I am free to speak about something this entire situation has made very clear. As someone who has grown up in the public eye, I have always had to be cautious about people taking advantage of my fame, and after I learned of my father\u2019s true identity, I learned that one of my \n\n\u201cfriends\u201d \n\nwas not only living up to that expectation, but actually assisting my father in his goals.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI do not know if she was doing it intentionally or not, but if we really want to move on from Hawkmoth\u2019s reign of terror, I think you all deserve to know the truth about Lila Rossi.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMarinette\u2019s eyes were wide as she looked up at him, \u201cI mean, we both know it\u2019s true, but you really accused her of working with Hawkmoth?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI did more than just accuse her.\u201d Adrien smiled. \u201cI exposed how Father tried to use her to control me and I reached out to each of the akumas she caused and got screenshots of their side of the story, and even included a few statements from Chat Noir.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette blinked slowly, \u201cWow\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not even the best part.\u201d Adrien continued. \u201cI talked to Jagged Stone, and he put me in contact with most of the celebrities Lila claimed to know. I got screenshots of those conversations too. It\u2019s all out in the open and now that Father\u2019s in jail and the butterfly is safe, she can\u2019t even get akumatized to try and cover it up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not coming back from this\u2026\u201d Marinette said softly.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Adrien whispered back. \u201cNo, she\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n\nThey stood back to watch as Lila\u2019s web of lies finally, \n\nfinally\n\n unraveled around her. Adrien held Marinette a little closer. He knew her well enough to know that she was still nervous. Lila was a master at manipulation. What if she managed to turn it around like she always had and blamed it on Marinette? She didn\u2019t have anything to worry about, though, Adrien had made sure of it. If people didn\u2019t take his word for it, they\u2019d take the word of Jagged Stone, Clara Nightingale, and Prince Ali. There was just too much evidence for them to deny at his point. Marinette had helped him get out from under his father\u2019s thumb, so he wasn\u2019t leaving anything to chance when it came to getting them both out from under Lila\u2019s.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you!\u201d Alya\u2019s voice echoed across the lunch room. \u201cWas everything you ever said a lie?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t seriously believe all that!\u201d Lila\u2019s eyes were full of large tears as she looked around, trying to find some sort of sympathy. \u201cAdrien is just trying to carry on his father\u2019s legacy of causing pain! He probably thought I was a good target because everyone loves me, but I\u2019d never hurt anyone or lie to them like that! You have to believe me!\u201d\n\n\nMarinette tensed beside him and before he could hold her back, she was striding across the room, \u201cAre you kidding me right now?!\u201d\n\n\nLila glared at her, \u201cMarinette. You had something to do with this, didn\u2019t you? Are you thinking that Gabriel will help with your non-existent fashion career if you do his bidding until he gets out of prison or something?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette scowled for a second and almost walked away until she realized that there was no reason for her to hold back anymore. No one was going to get akumatized today or ever again. She glanced toward Adrien and he probably should have held her back, but whatever she had in mind, Lila deserved it, so instead he just shrugged and gestured for her to continue. She gave him a small smirk before whipping around and giving Lila a long-deserved black eye.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done with you, Lila.\u201d Marinette huffed. \u201cAnd so is Adrien. We weren\u2019t the ones working with Hawkmoth and both the police and the heroes can confirm that, but you? You just got lucky that no one could expose you with you getting akumatized and wrecking the city. Good luck with karma.\u201d\n\n\nShe shook out her hand and turned back toward Adrien, \u201cI needed that. Can we go home?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien nodded, smiling, \u201cI\u2019m sure your parents won\u2019t be too mad about us missing afternoon classes.\u201d He took her hand and whispered, \u201cEspecially since we\u2019ve been missing less classes recently.\u201d\n\n\nShe giggled and they started walking away when Alya called out to them, \u201cMarinette! Wait!\u201d\n\n\nMarinette froze and Adrien squeezed her hand, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, you know. I can tell her to go away.\u201d\n\n\nInstead of saying anything, she just shook her head sharply and turned around, gripping Adrien\u2019s hand a little tighter. She held her head high as she stared Alya down and he was reminded of why he fell in love with her in the first place. His lady was always so brave.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI had no idea Lila was lying about all that!\u201d Alya insisted. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she would do something like that! We\u2019re good, right?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien stepped forward and almost hissed at her, but Marinette beat him too it, \u201cNo. We\u2019re not. You really hurt me, Alya and after all that, I just...I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t trust you anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut I\u2026\u201d Alya looked genuinely confused and Adrien couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault! Lila lied! What did you want me to do!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTrust me.\u201d Marinette said simply. \u201cOr if you couldn\u2019t do that, you could have at least fact-checked what Lila said like Adrien did. You run the Ladyblog Alya. You could have reached out to Ladybug at any time or even used that reputation to reach out to any of the other celebrities she claimed to know. You could have \n\ngoogled it.\n\n But you didn\u2019t. You shoved me aside and saw me as the villain when it wasn\u2019t true, all for some girl you\u2019d barely met. I\u2019m sorry, Alya, I know you\u2019re a good person, but you did nothing.\u201d Marinette sounded like she was holding back tears and Adrien squeezed her hand a little tighter, \u201cAnd this time, evil prevailed. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\nAlya opened and closed her mouth a few times, but Adrien didn\u2019t wait for her to finish gaping at them before leading Marinette away and out the door. His lady was strong, but he knew how important Alya had been to her and how much it hurt when she\u2019d turned her back on them, and he knew how much it took for Marinette to stand up to her like that, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette sniffled, \u201cI just wish\u2026\u201d\n\n\nAdrein sighed, \u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette smiled sadly, \u201cDo you think Papa would be willing to spare some chocolate croissants? I kinda need the sugar right now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cProbably.\u201d Adrien smiled back. \u201cBut the real question is if your mom will make us hot chocolate to pair with them.\u201d\n\n\nShe chuckled softly, then trailed off, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien nudged her with his shoulder, \u201cWhat else are partners for?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien held his head up high as they left the courtroom, stubbornly ignoring both the cameras shoved in their faces and the questions that were thrown at him from every direction from the crowd of reporters on the stairs. Marinette\u2019s grip was light, but steady on his arm, her presence more than enough to steady him, just like always. Her parents followed behind them, followed by the gorilla and the combined force of all three of them giving intimidating glares to every single reporter in attendance was just barely enough to let them get to the car without saying anything besides \n\nno comment. \n\nAs soon as the doors were finally shut and they were driving away, both Adrien and Marinette sighed in relief.\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien slumped over and put his head in Marinette\u2019s lap. She immediately giggled and started carding through his hair with her fingers like she\u2019d done a million times. It was comforting to have \n\nsomething\n\n remain the same, because so much had changed in the past few months. For one, he\u2019d finally learned who Ladybug was, but he\u2019d also learned who his father was, and so had the world. At first, Gabriel had tried fighting the charges, pulling out all the stops and hiring the best lawyers who were willing to take his case, but Adrien knew he was only fighting so hard so that he could get out and try to steal the miraculous a final time.\u00a0\n\n\nBut then Emille\u2019s life support had failed and she\u2019d passed away quietly in her sleep. Gabriel had stopped fighting after that.\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien hadn\u2019t ever gone to visit him in prison, which was only fair considering how little he\u2019d seen his father when things were good, so the trial was the first time he\u2019d even seen him since he\u2019d had to arrest his own father for terrorism. Adrien had been expecting it to be painful, but things had changed for him too. The Dupain-Chengs had fostered him for the almost two months it took to get the Gorilla cleared of all conspiracy charges, and they had spent that entire time teaching him what a family \n\nshould\n\n look like. They had dinner together. When Adrien had a question, he could go to Tom and he was always willing to listen or offer advice, or even just joke and laugh with him until they both felt a little better. It was everything that Adrien had always wanted.\n\n\nHe had been terrified when the Gorilla had been officially approved for custody. Sure, he knew that his old bodyguard cared about him and would take care of him, but he\u2019d always held him at arm\u2019s distance while the Dupain-Chengs wouldn\u2019t accept anything less than a bearhug and Adrien wasn\u2019t sure he could go back to that. Good thing he didn\u2019t have to.\u00a0\n\n\nIt turned out that now that they didn\u2019t have the barriers of \n\nprofessionality\n\n between them, Adrien didn\u2019t have anything to worry about. Sure, the Gorilla was quieter than the Dupain-Chengs were and sometimes he didn\u2019t quite know exactly what Adrien needed, but he was there and he was trying\n\n,\n\n which was more than his father had ever done. The Gorilla had even gotten Tom\u2019s number at one point and Adrien was 90% sure he occasionally texted to ask about parenting strategies. Even when he wasn\u2019t perfect, the amount of work he was putting in to make sure Adrien was happy was...Adrien hadn\u2019t ever experienced anything like it. Even Natalie ahd only put effort into his schedule and not into \n\nhim.\n\n He felt more spoiled now than he ever had when he\u2019d been living in a giant mansion.\u00a0\n\n\nAnother change was the therapy. Tom and Sabine had offered it without any judgement and even if he couldn\u2019t talk freely about being Chat Noir, his civilian identity had still been involved in Hawkmoth\u2019s arrest, so they\u2019d been able to at least scratch the surface of that guilt and most days, it seemed to be helping. Sure, he knew that it would take years to really feel \n\nok\n\n again, but on the nights when he and Marinette ran across the rooftops to remind Paris that they were still there and still protecting them, Adrien couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that everything was going to be ok as long as he had her by his side as the yin to his yang. It was just them against the world, the perfect team, just like always.\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien barely held back a purr as Marinette scratched behind his ear and he shuffled so that he could look up at her, \u201cPrincess?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette smiled, still playing with his hair, \u201cYeah, Kitty?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien bit his lip, \u201cNow that everything with my father is over...uh...would you like to go out for ice cream sometime? Maybe go to Andre? See if our colors match?\u201d\n\n\nMarinette gasped slightly and Adrien almost had time to panic before she broke out into the sweet, confident smile that had stolen his heart in the first place, \u201cSure, I\u2019d love that.\u201d\n\n\nShe leaned down and pressed a soft kiss to his hair and a low purr rumbled in Adrien\u2019s chest as he sat up and started holding her hand. He squeezed it a bit tighter as he looked out the window at the streets of Paris, \u201cWe did it. We kept Paris safe.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette nodded, \u201cWe did. Pound it?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien looked over and saw her grinning, holding out her free hand in a fist. A matching smile spread across his face as he nodded and held up his own free hand, \u201cPound it.\u201d\n"
