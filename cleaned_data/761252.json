    "text": "Stiles loves his job.\nHe\u2019s heard it said that people who hated math and science in high school actually thrive in those subjects later on in life\u2014he would think that it\u2019s bullshit, except sometimes it turns out to be true.\nYes, Stiles hated Harris\u2019 particular brand of torture (read: Chemistry class) and was often jealous of his classmates\u2019 ability to quickly grasp mathematical concepts that took him days of studying and question-asking to really comprehend, but that didn\u2019t mean that he wasn\u2019t actually talented in those classes.\u00a0 He just disliked them.\nIt\u2019s not a total surprise when Stiles finds himself in an internship for the LA police department\u2019s forensic lab right out of college.\u00a0 He goes to grad school, spends six years trying to coax a doctorate out of his department, and by the time he\u2019s the second-in-command of the FBI\u2019s crime lab located in San Diego, he\u2019s only 32.\u00a0 By his estimation, that\u2019s not a bad set up.\nOf course, the commander in chief is Ms. Lydia Martin, a stunning strawberry blonde with burning wit and an icy exterior.\u00a0 She\u2019s quite amusing, though, and ridiculously intelligent, and Stiles is kind of in love with her for a little while.\u00a0 There are a few other people in the lab who Stiles is quite taken with as well.\u00a0 Isaac Lahey is a slender, but muscled, man with adorable curls and a smile that makes Stiles feel all squishy inside.\u00a0 His best friend in the lab, Scott, works ballistics.\u00a0 He\u2019s goofy and manages to trip a lot, even though he thankfully has never managed to shoot anyone while he\u2019s working.\u00a0 Danny is their hacker guy, computer forensics.\u00a0 He would normally be underground in the cyber unit, but he\u2019s helped so much with so many cases that the director got him moved into the lab, a nice white coat and everything.\u00a0 He\u2019s devilishly handsome and kind to a fault; and it\u2019s not fair, Stiles thinks, that he\u2019s always surrounded by attractive people everywhere he goes\u2014his life is not MTV.\nEveryone he knows is clever.\u00a0 They\u2019re all intelligent and professional and hilarious, and Stiles loves his job.\nHe doesn\u2019t so much love the FBI agents he has to work with.\u00a0 To a point, he supposes, they\u2019re all decent people, but\u2026\nWell, Erica Reyes is practically a supermodel.\u00a0 She knows it, too, so she\u2019s not really shy.\u00a0 Stiles doesn\u2019t hate her so much as maintain equal parts fear and respect towards her.\u00a0 And attraction. She\u2019s good at her job at least.\u00a0 Then there\u2019s her partner, Vernon Boyd.\u00a0 Everyone just calls him Boyd.\u00a0 He\u2019s a hulking black guy who looks really good in a suit and is just as known for his winning smile as for his snarly glare.\nThey\u2019re nice, sometimes, Stiles knows.\u00a0 But it\u2019s not so much them as their boss.\nDerek Hale.\u00a0 Angels fucking weep when he so much as blinks at them.\u00a0 He is literally the perfect specimen\u2014tall, dark, handsome, an ass to die for, and a mouth to kill for.\u00a0 His eyes are gorgeous, his hair is always flawless, he looks like James Bond in a suit, and he has a permanent five o\u2019clock shadow that has been known to make knees go weak.\nAnd, most importantly, he is a giant douchebag.\u00a0 He never asks, simply orders; he glares and huffs and doesn\u2019t smile unless he\u2019s trying to manipulate someone.\u00a0 He\u2019s maybe just as much of a workaholic as Stiles is, because if Stiles ever has to walk through the squad room to get down to the lab\u2014sometimes the back elevator that will take him all the way down is packed so he has to make two separate trips\u2014he\u2019s there in the early morning with breakfast, he\u2019s been known to walk into the lab with his lunch in his hands, and sometimes, when Stiles leaves, he\u2019s sitting at his desk, in near darkness, with dinner.\nStiles thinks he might be lonely.\u00a0 But it\u2019s no excuse for his attitude.\nStiles isn\u2019t an idiot.\u00a0 He knows that the agents don\u2019t really respect the lab rats.\u00a0 But Derek\u2019s disrespect\u2026irks him.\u00a0 At least until he\u2019s 33 and Derek Hale is waltzing into the lab with his hands stuck in his trouser pockets and his face a cool mask of dismissal.\n\u201cDanny,\u201d is the only thing he says.\nIt\u2019s still early, so Stiles and Scott are the only ones in for now\u2014official work day won\u2019t start for another half hour.\u00a0 Lydia\u2019s out getting them coffee.\n\u201cNot in yet,\u201d Stiles says, only glancing up for a second before going back to his crossword puzzle.\u00a0 \u201cHis station\u2019s in the back, to the left.\u00a0 You can leave him a note on his desk, if you like.\u201d\n\u201cI was wondering if he had decrypted something I sent him last night.\u201d\nStiles shrugs, penning in an answer.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019ll be in within the next half hour.\u00a0 You can wait by his desk or you can shoot him an email\u2014but I\u2019m not his caretaker.\u00a0 If he\u2019s working on a case with you, I\u2019m not privy to his progress.\u201d\nDerek is silent, and when Stiles looks up again, the man is watching him with a quirked eyebrow.\nStiles mimics the facial expression.\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re Stilinski.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it says on my coat.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s the arm?\u201d\nStiles blinks, sits up straight.\nAbout a week ago, there had been an incident in the lab.\u00a0 He\u2019d been injured.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t really a big deal, it was a careless mistake that no one planned on repeating, but he\u2019d worn a bandage for a while and his arm stung like hell.\n\u201cUh, good.\u00a0 Thanks.\u201d\nDerek nods.\u00a0 \u201cErica told me about the burn.\u201d\nHe shrugs.\u00a0 \u201cOccupational hazard.\u201d\n\u201cShe also said you were working on the murder weapon when it happened.\u201d\n\u201cLike I said.\u00a0 Occupation\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou solved the case.\u201d\nStiles is thrown.\u00a0 Again.\u00a0 Because not only does Derek Hale not associate with lab rats, he doesn\u2019t say more than ten words to them usually\u2014unless he\u2019s asking questions\u2014and he definitely doesn\u2019t hand out credit to them.\n\u201cUm, thanks?\u00a0 It\u2019s kind of my job, dude.\u201d\nIt\u2019s Derek\u2019s turn to shrug.\u00a0 \u201cNot supposed to get yourself injured in the process.\u201d\nStiles heats up a bit at that\u2014it wasn\u2019t really his fault, and he had been the one to figure out that the chemical involved had been used as slow poison, hidden in weekly meals\u2014but before he can say anything, Danny comes striding in, texting away.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he greets Derek, barely looking up from his phone.\u00a0 \u201cYou here about the file?\u201d\nDerek stands up a little straighter and nods.\n\u201cCool.\u201d\u00a0 He jerks his head towards the back of the lab.\u00a0 \u201cCome on back and I\u2019ll see if I can talk you through it.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s all he says to Derek before strolling up to Stiles and stealing a donut from the box next to him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d Stiles calls after him.\nSome people.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the substance on the victim\u2019s coat?\u201d\nStiles looks up from the microscope to find Derek leaning over him, eyes on the computer.\u00a0 The image under the scope is showing up on the screen, different hues of green all mashed together.\nStiles clears his throat.\u00a0 \u201cThe stuff they put in Henna tattoos.\u201d\nDerek frowns.\u00a0 \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have any tattoos.\u00a0 And she was employed at a nursing home.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t do the leg work, dude, I just examine the evidence.\u201d\nDerek looks at him again\u2014second time in two weeks, jeez\u2014and tilts his head.\u00a0 \u201cWhy is there a piece of tape over your badge?\u201d\nStiles grabs for the badge that\u2019s clipped to his coat pocket, stuffing it unceremoniously into the deeper pocket by his waist.\u00a0 It\u2019s a piece of thin, black electrical tape that covers his first name.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t been able to get the bureau to put \u201cStiles\u201d on there in place of it\u2014they wanted his legal name.\u00a0 So he\u2019d done his own repair to the monstrosity.\u00a0 \u201cDo you want Scott to go through the GSW stuff with you or what?\u201d\n\u201cMcCall emailed me a lab report earlier,\u201d Derek says dryly.\u00a0 \u201cThree shots.\u00a0 One to the sternum, one to the shoulder, and one to the forehead.\u00a0 Two to injure, one to kill.\u201d\nStiles shudders.\u00a0 \u201cYeah, Lydia and Scott are really the ones who are cool with the whole dead guy stuff\u2014I just look at chemicals.\u201d\nDerek seems to accept that, so he asks, \u201cWhat about the dirt we found on her clothes?\u00a0 Dr. Martin told me there were two kinds, so I figure that means she was killed one place and buried another.\u201d\nPointing lazily, Stiles goes back to his microscope.\u00a0 \u201cIsaac does dirt and bugs.\u00a0 If he has anything for you, he can tell you.\u201d\nWhen Stiles looks up again a moment later, Derek\u2019s gone.\nStiles rolls his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles thinks they need a shiny button in the lab for when they figure stuff out.\u00a0 As soon as they discover something, they can punch it, balloons can fall from the ceiling, and they can celebrate.\u00a0 Alcohol should also be involved.\nBut at 11 o\u2019clock at night, when the lab is nearly empty, that\u2019s not really the best time to be jumping up and down.\nLydia is the only one who ever ventures out into the squad room.\u00a0 She\u2019s the only one who enters that territory to tell the agents the who, what, why, where, and how.\u00a0 But the only people in the lab right now are Stiles and Danny.\n\u201cI need a favor.\u201d\nDanny doesn\u2019t look up from where he\u2019s typing.\u00a0 He simply grunts.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you heard\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA minute ago when you shouted \u2018FIGURED IT OUT\u2019 at the top of your lungs?\u201d Danny asks.\u00a0 \u201cYeah, I heard it.\u201d\n\u201cRight, well, I figured something out and I need you to the take the file up to Agent Hale.\u201d\nDanny stops typing.\u00a0 \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cC\u2019mon, you know he\u2019s still here.\u00a0 He\u2019s always here, especially when it\u2019s a case like this.\u201d\nA dead woman, buried alive.\u00a0 And she was pregnant.\u00a0 Stiles can say all he wants about Derek\u2014he takes shit like this personally.\u00a0 And if Stiles were a bigger person, he wouldn\u2019t understand why.\u00a0 But because background searches are in the archives and Stiles has a pass and an in with the cyber unit, Stiles knows that his parents were murdered when he was a teenager.\u00a0 Along with his little sister.\nDanny gives him a patented glare.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not the one who figured out whatever the hell you figured out\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, she had that plastic thing stuck in her leg and I found out that it\u2019s a piece of a license plate sticker that we could potentially\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStiles.\u201d\nStiles closes his mouth.\n\u201cYou go tell him.\u00a0 I know you\u2019re terrified of him,\u201d Danny says teasingly, a smirk coming to his face, \u201cbut Lydia\u2019s not here to do your dirty work.\u00a0 So you go do it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026do I have to?\u201d\n\u201cYou want to send him an email instead?\u00a0 He might skin you alive for not getting the info to him faster than that.\u201d\nStiles pouts.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll buy you lunch for a week.\u201d\n\u201cI already got Scott doing that.\u00a0 He lost a bet.\u201d\n\u201cC\u2019mon, pleeeeeease?\u201d\nDanny doesn\u2019t speak.\u00a0 Instead, he shuts down his computer, picks up his briefcase, and starts heading towards the door.\u00a0 \u201cG\u2019night, Stiles.\u00a0 Say hello to Hale for me.\u201d\nUsually at this time of night, the only person in the squad room is Derek.\u00a0 But tonight, he\u2019s accompanied by Erica and Boyd.\nDerek looks up when he enters their little arena, stopping by the desk in the corner that he assumes must be Erica\u2019s.\u00a0 Her purse is sticking out from under it and there\u2019s a tissue with lipstick on it that\u2019s dangling halfway out of the trashcan.\n\u201cSomething for us, Dr. Stilinski?\u201d Erica drawls.\u00a0 She looks tired.\u00a0 Her curly hair is up in a messy bun, her shoes are off and next to the desk, and her shirt is almost all the way unbuttoned, revealing her tank top underneath.\u00a0 Her arms are folded across her chest, but her hands are holding her elbows instead of tucking inside, closer to her chest.\u00a0 She\u2019s not upset.\u00a0 She\u2019s resigned.\u00a0 She appears to have given up.\nBoyd, on the other hand, is standing a little ways behind her.\u00a0 His jacket is off, his shirt is no longer tucked into his pants, and he\u2019s still wearing his shoes, but his hands are in his pockets, and he\u2019s glaring at the screen in front of them like it holds the answer to the universe.\nDerek is sitting at the desk across from Erica\u2019s.\u00a0 He\u2019s lounging in the chair, papers strewn across his desk.\u00a0 His tie is loosened.\u00a0 His hair looks like he\u2019s tugged his hands through it a few too many times.\u00a0 And he has leftover Chinese food containers on his desk, like he tried to eat dinner but couldn\u2019t stomach his way through it.\n\u201cThe thing stuck in her calf,\u201d Stiles starts.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a license plate sticker.\u201d\nIt\u2019s quiet.\n\u201cShe was hit by a car,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cWould account for the head injury,\u201d Boyd offers, nodding.\u00a0 \u201cCould be how the killer got her from her office to the place of burial.\u201d\nDerek looks up at Stiles with tired, red eyes.\u00a0 \u201cCan you trace the plate it belonged to?\u201d\nStiles grimaces.\u00a0 \u201cUh, maybe.\u00a0 It\u2019s kind of complicated.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\n\u201cTime?\u00a0 And access to DMV records. And even then, I can\u2019t promise anything.\u201d\nDerek nods.\u00a0 \u201cDanny\u2019s computer has a database.\u201d\nStiles is aware.\u00a0 He steps forward, though, and holds out the file.\u00a0 \u201cAll other evidence complied over the last twenty-four hours, just in case you wanted to take another look at it all in one place.\u201d\nDerek takes it.\u00a0 \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\u00a0 Stiles turns to go, then, but Derek\u2019s voice stops him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going back to the lab, are you?\u201d he asks, and he actually sounds surprised.\nStiles shrugs.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have anything better to do.\u201d\n\u201cGo home.\u201d\u00a0 Derek stands up, switching off his desk light.\u00a0 Erica and Boyd look at him like he\u2019s an alien.\u00a0 \u201cYou two should also.\u00a0 It\u2019s late\u2014we can\u2019t do anything with our heads not in it.\u201d\u00a0 He takes the file Stiles had brought him and sticks in a drawer, locking it.\u00a0 When he stands up straight again, he jerks his head towards the elevator bay.\u00a0 \u201cGo.\u201d\nSo Erica and Boyd do, and Stiles only lingers a moment before walking back the opposite way, towards the elevators that go down to the lab and autopsy.\nHe\u2019s busy trying not to freak out about the extraterrestrial that has inhabited Derek Hale\u2019s body when said body slides into the elevator with him just before the doors close.\nStiles blinks at him.\u00a0 \u201cThis elevator doesn\u2019t go to the parking structure.\u201d\nDerek nods.\u00a0 \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026okay.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m making sure you don\u2019t go back to work,\u201d Derek says gruffly, staring with determination at the elevator doors.\u00a0 \u201cGet your stuff, I\u2019ll drive you home.\u201d\nHe normally commutes with Scott since they live close to each other, but on nights when Stiles stays late, he finds other sources of transportations.\u00a0 He wonders how Derek knows this.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll call a cab.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nearly midnight.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, thanks, Dad,\u201d Stiles says with as much of a bite as he can muster through a yawn that comes out of nowhere.\u00a0 \u201cCabs work all hours.\u201d\n\u201cI mean it\u2019s not safe.\u201d\nStiles shrugs.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s New York.\u00a0 We\u2019re in San Diego\u2014you think my cab driver\u2019s gonna try to rob me?\u201d\u00a0 The elevator stops and Stiles hurries out, hanging up his coat and going through the space to turn things off.\u00a0 It only takes him a few minutes and when he heads back towards with the door with his regular jacket on and his backpack hooked over his shoulder, Derek is leading against the wall, staring at the evidence table in the center of the lab.\nThere are a million different tox screens, most notably the one that informed them in the first place that the victim had been pregnant.\nStiles clears his throat.\u00a0 \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, and Derek looks up at him.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019d appreciate a ride home.\u201d\nHe isn\u2019t surprised to find out that Derek drives a sleek, black Camaro.\u00a0 He is surprised to find out that as soon as he starts to give Derek directions to his place, Derek stops him.\n\u201cI know where it is.\u201d\nStiles frowns.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s not creepy at all.\u201d\n\u201cMy sister lives in your building.\u00a0 I saw your name on the buzzers when I was visiting her.\u201d\u00a0 He gives Stiles a side glance.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s your first name, anyway?\u00a0 I know people call you Stiles, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just my name.\u00a0 My, uh, legal name is a bit of a mouthful.\u00a0 So people call me Stiles.\u201d\nDerek seems to accept that for an answer, and he\u2019s silent until they pull up outside Stiles\u2019 building.\u00a0 Stiles thanks him, Derek gives a meager wave, and then Stiles walks into the lobby and makes a note of looking for a Hale on the buzzers.\nHe finds a Laura.\nIt makes him feel slightly accomplished.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen they solve the case, Derek is the only one who doesn\u2019t look ecstatic.\u00a0 But that\u2019s probably because he has to the shoot the bad guy.\n\u201cI\u2019m always relieved when the bad guy ends up dead instead of in jail,\u201d Lydia says as she slides Stiles a shot.\u00a0 Possibly the only good thing about this bar is that they give law enforcement personal free whiskey.\u00a0 \u201cTo dead murderers and a night of rest before another dead body turns up.\u201d\nStiles tips his glass against hers and they throw them back together, wincing.\n\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Scott interrupts then, appearing out of nowhere with a raven-haired beauty on his arm and a lipstick smudge on his lower lip.\u00a0 \u201cCelebrating?\u201d\n\u201cIs there any other way to end a case?\u201d Lydia asks.\u00a0 But then she checks her watch and slides off the barstool, kissing Stiles\u2019 cheek.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll see you bright and early tomorrow\u2014Jackson\u2019s probably waiting up.\u201d\nStiles forces a grin onto his face.\u00a0 \u201cSay hello to the boyfriend from hell for me.\u201d\nShe flips him off as she leaves.\nScott\u2019s friend turns out to be a new analyst, Allison.\u00a0 Stiles pretends like he has no idea who she is, for his friend\u2019s sake of course, because she\u2019s all he\u2019s been able to talk about for weeks.\u00a0 When they leave together a little while later, Stiles is happy for Scott.\nHe has another shot, then another, and when he\u2019s feeling warm and a little looser, he goes home, jerks off in the shower, and goes to sleep.\u00a0 Because that\u2019s apparently as exciting as his life gets.\nBut in the morning, that ache is still there.\u00a0 It\u2019s an uncomfortable burning sensation that tightens his chest, and it\u2019s been there since he saw the look on Derek\u2019s face as he filled out paperwork, spattered blood still on his formerly-pristine white shirt.\nWhen Stiles goes in the next morning, he takes the long way so that he\u2019s forced to walk by the squad room.\nDerek is the only one there.\nHe\u2019s sitting at his desk, reading the newspaper, coffee in hand.\u00a0 And apparently Stiles lingers a little too long, because he looks up.\nStiles flushes red and manages to stutter out an apology before heading towards the other elevator bank that will take him down to the lab.\u00a0 If Derek responds, Stiles doesn\u2019t hear it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s not interested in Derek.\u00a0 Not really.\u00a0 Sure, he\u2019s hot, and Stiles has always been aware of that, but they\u2019re not even friends.\nRight?\nThey\u2019re not friends.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, dude,\u201d Isaac says as he dumps maggots into a blender.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re kind of the only person in here besides Danny who Agent Hale has regular conversations with.\u201d\nStiles pulls a face.\u00a0 It\u2019s been weeks since they actually worked together on a case, yet Derek still comes down to see Lydia or Isaac every once in a while and yeah.\u00a0 Kind of.\u00a0 They kind of talk.\u00a0 \u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cSo,\u201d Danny pipes up from his desk, \u201cDerek and I only have conversations because he\u2019s about as technologically advanced as my grandfather.\u00a0 You and Derek have conversations because he finds you easy to talk to.\u201d\u00a0 He looks over his computer.\u00a0 \u201cAnyone who Derek finds easy to talk to is his friend.\u00a0 Like Erica and Boyd.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so sometimes we talk.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\n\u201cKeep telling yourself that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re heading back to the lab right now,\u201d Lydia sighs, and Stiles moves the phone to squish between his cheek and his shoulder so that he can wipe his hands off on a napkin as his donut disappears into his mouth.\nHe talks as he chews.\u00a0 \u201cWhy do you sound frustrated?\u201d\n\u201cBesides the fact that I have to listen to you talk at me with your mouth full?\u201d\u00a0 She heaves another sigh.\u00a0 \u201cThere was a bomb.\u00a0 Inside the body.\u201d\nStiles pulls a face.\u00a0 \u201cEw.\u201d\n\u201cNot only are the remains and all evidence compromised, but everyone within a twenty-foot radius of the blast has become evidence.\u201d\nStiles blinks.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t tell me.\u201d\n\u201cAgents Hale, Reyes, and Boyd are heading back to the lab with me to be thoroughly examined and de-evidenced.\u201d\n\u201cOh, c\u2019mon, Lydia!\u00a0 Couldn\u2019t I have just one\u2014just one case this month that doesn\u2019t involve them?!\u201d\n\u201cSuck it up, Stilinski.\u00a0 I would offer to let you pick the doll you\u2019ll be de-funking, but I\u2019ve already decided which one will suit you best.\u201d\u00a0 She blows quick kisses into the phone.\u00a0 \u201cSee you in five, lover boy.\u201d\nStiles only barely resists the urge to chuck his phone.\nOkay, so he kind of maybe fell asleep at his desk one time and mumbled Derek\u2019s name.\u00a0 And since then, no one has let him live it down.\u00a0 He can\u2019t really blame them\u2014he would do the same thing in their position\u2014but he\u2019s not happy about it.\u00a0 Especially since the last time he and Derek talked outside of work stuff was months ago.\nErica is the first one through the door.\n\u201cI\u2019m taking her!\u201d Lydia says before anyone can jump up and offer.\u00a0 \u201cAgent Reyes, if you\u2019d like to step into my office\u2014\u201d\nErica goes, fuming, most likely because she\u2019s covered in blood and gunk and, oh, she\u2019s going to need a very long shower.\nBoyd is significantly less bloody than his partner, but he heads over to Isaac.\u00a0 Stiles thinks they\u2019ve kind of become friends lately, and Lydia directs them both into the back, where Scott normally works, so that there\u2019s more privacy.\n\u201cAgent Hale.\u201d\u00a0 Lydia rolls out plastic and lays it over one of their evidence tables.\u00a0 \u201cDr. Stilinski\u2014have at it.\u00a0 And remember, we need all the evidence.\u201d\u00a0 She smirks.\u00a0 \u201cSo, Agent Hale, you can find sweatpants and an FBI T-shirt in the back of the lab when you\u2019re ready.\u201d\nAs soon as she\u2019s disappeared, Stiles rolls his eyes and snaps on gloves.\u00a0 Derek looks a little worse for wear.\u00a0 There\u2019s gunk in his hair, stuck in his suit, and oh, yes, that\u2019s definitely something that was once connected to a vital organ.\nStiles sighs and grabs a few evidence jars.\u00a0 \u201cI guess we\u2019ll start with the suit jacket.\u201d\nHe picks out all the evidence he can\u2014they\u2019re mostly body parts to return to autopsy downstairs\u2014and helps Derek out of the jacket, laying it over the plastic.\n\u201cRelax, would you?\u201d Stiles mutters, scraping tissue off of the front of Derek\u2019s shirt.\u00a0 \u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to blow a fuse.\u201d\u00a0 He chuckles and looks up to find Derek glaring.\u00a0 \u201cNot funny, huh?\u00a0 Should\u2019ve thought of that.\u201d\nDerek doesn\u2019t say anything, but he does roll his shoulders and rest against the table a little more.\n\u201cThere we go.\u00a0 Progress.\u201d\u00a0 He clears his throat and sets down his tweezers.\u00a0 \u201cAll right, off with the shirt.\u201d\nAnd just like that, Derek stiffens up again.\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard her\u2014all evidence.\u201d\u00a0 When Derek still doesn\u2019t move, Stiles rolls his eyes.\u00a0 \u201cC\u2019mon, dude, Lydia\u2019ll have my ass.\u00a0 Take it off.\u201d\nDerek grumbles something under his breath, but he does start unbuttoning the shirt.\u00a0 And, without being asked, he whips off the undershirt underneath.\nStiles does not stare.\u00a0 Not at all.\u00a0 Not even the tiniest bit.\nMaybe he flushes a little bit pink and stammers something he doesn\u2019t even remember, but he doesn\u2019t stare.\u00a0 Definitely not.\nAnd then he clears his throat and says, \u201cPants, too.\u201d\nDerek narrows his eyes.\nIf Stiles were still a college student, he would probably let Derek take off his own pants.\u00a0 But now he\u2019s a doctor, now he\u2019s, like, legit, and so\u2014so\u2014shit.\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 He slaps Derek\u2019s hands away as he reaches for his waistband.\u00a0 \u201cUh\u2014it\u2019s\u2014you can\u2019t compromise the evidence.\u201d\nDerek arches an eyebrow.\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d\nStiles licks his lips.\u00a0 \u201cGoop,\u201d he says stupidly.\u00a0 \u201cOn your belt buckle.\u201d\nAnd sure enough, there is.\u00a0 Derek even looks a little surprised.\u00a0 But he just grits his teeth and spreads his hands.\u00a0 \u201cFine.\u201d\nStiles is not proud of the heat the crawls up his spine when he works on getting Derek\u2019s belt off.\u00a0 It\u2019s not professional and it\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s really not normal.\u00a0 There\u2019s blood and body parts and it\u2019s definitely, just, not a good situation.\nWhen Derek\u2019s pants are looser around his hips\u2014those fucking hips, Stiles thinks\u2014Stiles takes a step back.\n\u201cRight, okay, you\u2014you do that and I\u2019ll get\u2014you pants.\u00a0 New pants.\u00a0 For you.\u201d\u00a0 So Stiles turns and stumbles his way into the back, rummaging around for the sweats and T-shirt Lydia had promised.\u00a0 When he comes back into the front room, after giving himself a thorough mental tongue-lashing, Derek is standing with his hands together in front of his crotch, in nothing but black boxer briefs.\nStiles\u2019 mouth goes a little dry.\u00a0 He shoves the clothes at Derek without a word and walks around the table to start dealing with the evidence\u2014but does not stare at Derek\u2019s butt.\u00a0 At all.\u00a0 Definitely not.\nOkay, maybe a little bit.\nBut in his defense, it is probably the nicest butt Stiles has ever seen.\nHe finishes up by plucking a molar from Derek\u2019s hair and wiping the back of his neck to get rid of excess blood.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, exhaling, \u201cyou\u2019re welcome to head for the chemical showers.\u00a0 And I think Agents Boyd and Reyes will be there momentarily.\u201d\nDerek nods stiffly.\u00a0 \u201cUh, thanks.\u201d\nStiles waves.\u00a0 \u201cNo problem.\u201d\nHe decides then and there\u2014he hates Lydia Martin.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles starts going to the crime scenes.\u00a0 That\u2019s usually more of Lydia\u2019s gig, sometimes Scott\u2019s when there\u2019s a gun involved, and Isaac always goes to make sure the appropriate number of samples are taken for his research, but Stiles\u2026\u00a0 Not so much.\u00a0 He mostly just sits in the lab and waits for Lydia to bring him things.\nThat changes.\nHe doesn\u2019t always work with Derek\u2019s team\u2014there are other people in the lab, people who Stiles isn\u2019t as close to, and they switch off a lot, depending on the case\u2014but it\u2019s happened a few times.\nOne time, they\u2019re on the third kill with the same pattern.\u00a0 A body found by the beach, naked, showing signs of intercourse before death.\u00a0 The fourth time, it isn\u2019t a woman, but a man.\u00a0 And he isn\u2019t on the beach, but is in an alley near the sand, wrapped in a tarp.\n\u201cBreaking the pattern,\u201d Derek huffs softly.\n\u201cPotential for a copycat,\u201d Erica tells him.\u00a0 \u201cThis has been in the news a lot.\u201d\nDerek shakes his head.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s in threes.\u201d\nStiles, who\u2019s standing near the ME van with Lydia and Isaac, perks up.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s in threes?\u201d\nWithout looking up from the body, Derek tells him, \u201cThere\u2019s a cold case.\u00a0 Killed nine people.\u00a0 Three of them were found in the restrooms of seedy bars, three of them were left in Dumpsters, and three of them were buried in the gardens of their childhood homes.\u00a0 Each time, the killer switched up their relationship, the murder weapon, and the time frame, but left a slight connection.\u00a0 This time, it\u2019s the location.\u00a0 It\u2019s close, but not exact.\u00a0 Like he\u2019s playing a game.\u201d\n\u201cHow long ago?\u201d Lydia asks.\n\u201cAbout a year\u2014it wasn\u2019t my case, but I remember it well.\u201d\u00a0 He pulls out his cell phone and dials, and a moment later, he says, \u201cHey.\u00a0 Yeah, it\u2019s me.\u00a0 Is she in?\u201d\u00a0 He stretches out his other arm and beckons another man in a suit over.\u00a0 \u201cGreat.\u00a0 Yes, I\u2019ll hold.\u201d\u00a0 He puts the phone to his chest and says to the man, \u201cAgent Donovan\u2019s case from last year.\u201d\nThe man, who Stiles guesses is another agent, sighs, shaking his head.\u00a0 \u201cWell, you can have it if you want,\u201d he offers.\n\u201cHe worked with the San Diego Homicide Unit.\u00a0 I know the detective who helped him out.\u201d\nThe stranger nods.\u00a0 \u201cAlright.\u00a0 Get him on board, you two are on it.\u201d\nDerek copies his short nod\u2014it\u2019s an FBI thing, Stiles thinks\u2014and then goes back to the phone.\u00a0 It\u2019s only a moment before Derek looks up and meets his gaze.\u00a0 This time, Stiles doesn\u2019t look away.\u00a0 Neither does Derek.\n\u201cDonovan\u2019s case,\u201d is all Derek says into the phone at first.\u00a0 A moment later, he rattles off the address of the nearest building.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t look away from Stiles.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll see you in ten.\u201d\nLydia rushes Stiles into bagging evidence and scraping up sand particles, and as they\u2019re bent over on the concrete, she hisses, \u201cWill you please just bang him already?\u00a0 The sexual tension is making me sick.\u201d\nStiles almost topples over from the delicate balance he\u2019s achieved.\u00a0 \u201cLydia!\u201d\n\u201cYou and Agent Sexy\u2014you\u2019re killing me.\u201d\n\u201cThere is nothing\u2014what are you even\u2014Derek and I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, you call him Derek to his face now?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a relatively recent development.\u00a0 Stiles hadn\u2019t really called him anything until during a case a few weeks ago, Stiles had referred to him as Agent Hale, and the man had bit out a quick, \u201cCall me Derek,\u201d before turning back to the files in front of him.\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\nLydia arches an eyebrow.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m just saying.\u00a0 You should climb that like a tree.\u201d\n\u201cWho says I want to?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not as stupid as you seem to think we are.\u201d\u00a0 Lydia scrapes up a piece of chewing gum that looks relatively recent and places it in a little container, screwing on the lid and scrawling her signature on a line on the top.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll go take care of this.\u00a0 You go ask him out.\u201d\nHis jaw drops.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re at a crime scene!\u00a0 This is a very emotionally upsetting time, especially involving a cold case and a serial killer and\u2014and\u2014no.\u201d\nLydia shrugs.\u00a0 \u201cGuess you\u2019re gonna have to find another way back to the lab, then, because you\u2019re not getting in the van unless you\u2019ve made plans with him.\u201d\u00a0 She stands and pats his head.\u00a0 \u201cLater, Stilinski.\u201d\nHe calls Scott.\u00a0 But not until after he\u2019s noticed that a woman in a stylish pantsuit with dark hair piled on top of her head\u2014and a figure that would make any men paw at the ground like an animal, but how is that important?\u2014approaches Derek and is\u2026very comfortable with him.\nSo Stiles goes back to the lab in Scott\u2019s car and begins analyzing evidence.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTwo more bodies show up, in alleys near the beach, wrapped in tarps.\u00a0 The last three, the women, were file clerks.\u00a0 The new three, the men, are cops.\nLaura Hale is the presiding SDPD Detective, the one who worked the case a year ago with the now-deceased Agent Donovan.\u00a0 She\u2019s easily one of Stiles\u2019 favorite cops ever.\n\u201cMy little brother is too protective,\u201d she says as she lounges in Isaac\u2019s desk chair, her feet up.\u00a0 \u201cBut he knows when to let me do my job.\u00a0 So\u2014what do you have for me, sweet cheeks?\u201d\nShe\u2019s beautiful and funny and intelligent and she reminds Stiles of Lydia in more ways than one.\u00a0 She takes all the information he gives her and absorbs it, nods, and heads for the exit.\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t ask questions.\u00a0 Stiles doesn\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing.\nThen, two days later, the head of the SDPD crime lab goes missing.\u00a0 His body turns up outside Stiles\u2019 apartment building a day after that.\nHe may be momentarily sick, but there are big arms to catch him before he hits the cement.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he rasps, but he\u2019s turning green.\u00a0 He turns away from the body\u2014the man\u2019s name is Franklin Brinkley.\u00a0 Stiles had gone to his wedding a few years ago.\u00a0 And, somehow, that thought doesn\u2019t help, because he\u2019s hurling a moment later, arms still around him.\nDerek gets him water and sits him in back of the ME van.\u00a0 \u201cStay,\u201d he says.\nA little while later, Laura is next to him, bumping her shoulder against his.\n\u201cHey.\u201d\nStiles is silent.\n\u201cI can practically hear the gears working in your head.\u201d\n\u201cHe has a pattern,\u201d Stiles whispers.\u00a0 \u201cOn this spree, it\u2019s people of similar professions.\u201d\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a dirty cop.\u201d\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0 He squeezes the water bottle in his hands.\u00a0 \u201cThree file clerks who worked for law enforcement.\u00a0 Three cops.\u00a0 And now a forensic scientist with the crime lab.\u201d\n\u201cAre you scared?\u201d\nHe shudders.\nShe nods.\u00a0 \u201cYeah.\u00a0 Yeah, I am too.\u201d\nDerek walks up a little while later and he has Lydia and Isaac in tow.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re putting agents on you and everyone in the lab,\u201d he says.\u00a0 \u201cOne on your body, two in your place of residence.\u00a0 You do not go anywhere without telling them, you do not try to get away from them, and you do not, under any circumstances\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI got it,\u201d Stiles says, and he\u2019s a little shaky still.\u00a0 \u201cNot going anywhere without my shadow.\u00a0 Who do I get?\u201d\nDerek clears his throat.\u00a0 \u201cAlthough there\u2019s no proof that he\u2019s only going after the head of the lab, I\u2019m on Dr. Martin, just in case.\u00a0 You get Erica.\u00a0 Dr. Lahey gets Boyd.\u00a0 And we have other agents already heading towards the lab to divvy up responsibilities.\u201d\nStiles nods.\n\u201cC\u2019mon.\u00a0 I\u2019ll follow you guys back to the lab.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nErica is quiet.\u00a0 She sits there with her phone in her hands, feet up on Stiles\u2019 desk, and doesn\u2019t say a thing.\u00a0 He works numbly.\u00a0 There are a handful of other agents scattered about.\u00a0 Derek is in Lydia\u2019s office.\u00a0 Boyd is in the back, sitting between Scott, Danny, and Isaac.\u00a0 There are others, ones that Stiles doesn\u2019t recognize, and when it\u2019s time to go home, he just grabs his coat and peeks in to say goodnight to Lydia.\n\u201cJackson might not be a fan of him,\u201d Lydia says, fully aware that Derek can hear everything she\u2019s saying, \u201cbut I guess we\u2019ll just have to see, won\u2019t we?\u201d\nStiles smirks and kisses her cheek.\u00a0 \u201cG\u2019night, Derek,\u201d he says, lifting a hand.\nDerek nods.\u00a0 \u201cGoodnight, Stiles.\u201d\nErica follows Stiles home.\u00a0 There\u2019s another agent there when they arrive, a man who sits at Stiles\u2019 kitchen counter and cleans his weapon.\u00a0 Stiles isn\u2019t really a fan.\nIt\u2019s nearly midnight when there\u2019s a knock on his door.\u00a0 Instinctively, Stiles stands from his couch to get it, but Erica jumps in front of him, holding a finger to her lips.\u00a0 She has her gun by her leg, the other agent approaching with his weapon in place, but when Erica looks through the peephole and opens the door, she sighs and rests her hand on her hip.\u00a0 \u201cDr. Martin.\u201d\nLydia pushes past her, and Derek is right behind her, grumbling.\n\u201cSafety in numbers and all,\u201d is her greeting to Stiles.\u00a0 She kicks off her shoes and takes off her jacket, kissing his stunned cheek.\u00a0 \u201cSleepover!\u201d\u00a0 While she\u2019s leaning in close, she grins at him.\u00a0 \u201cAlso, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\u201cFor what?\u201d\nShe smirks.\u00a0 \u201cYou know what.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles makes coffee.\u00a0 He and Lydia sit on his bed and talk.\u00a0 The agents stay in the living room.\nEventually, Stiles falls asleep.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe wakes up to gunshots.\u00a0 It\u2019s dark and Lydia\u2019s asleep next to him, a pillow over her head, and when he heads towards the other room (because he\u2019s stupid and has a death wish), he\u2019s answered with a bullet in his leg, shot right through the wood of the door.\nHe falls over, shouting, hands clenched, and Lydia stirs, sitting up.\nWordlessly, he points to the window.\u00a0 Fire escape.\nHer eyes widen and she shakes her head, but he jerks his arm.\u00a0 \u201cGo, it\u2019s you they want!\u00a0 Laura\u2019s two floors down.\u00a0 Go!\u201d\nIt\u2019s all very cinematic.\u00a0 Sure, there\u2019s fear and adrenaline pumping through him, and he can see how it\u2019ll play out.\u00a0 Lydia will escape, get down to Laura, and she\u2019ll come in just in time.\u00a0 But Stiles doesn\u2019t know who\u2019s out in the living room\u2014he doesn\u2019t know who\u2019s still alive.\u00a0 And instead of doing what she should do, Lydia does\u2026something better.\nShe digs a gun out of her purse by the side of the bed, and the second the bedroom door opens, she fires.\nStiles is too busy being in pain\u2014and being fucking stunned that Lydia not only carries around a gun, but is such a good shot\u2014to care how the stranger drops, bleeding heavily.\n\u201cStiles!\u201d comes a shout from the main room.\nRelief floods him.\u00a0 Derek\u2019s alive.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re okay!\u201d he shouts back.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re both\u2014Lydia shot\u2014I\u2014\u201d\u00a0 He trails off and winces in pain.\u00a0 \u201cUm, I kind of got shot but, uh, bad guy\u2019s dead, Lydia\u2019s uninjured.\u00a0 How are things on your end?\u201d\nLydia stomps out of the room, gun still in his hand, and calls back.\u00a0 \u201cStiles, how expensive are your floors?\u201d\nStiles sighs.\n\u201cErica and Cole are unconscious, but otherwise okay,\u201d Derek tells him, and then he appears in the doorway with a face that looks like it belongs in Fight Club and an arm that definitely needs attention.\u00a0 \u201cMore agents approaching.\u00a0 Let me see your leg.\u201d\nStiles shakes his head.\u00a0 It hurts.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t touch.\u201d\nDerek swallows tightly.\u00a0 \u201cC\u2019mon, Stiles, we\u2019re gonna get you to the hospital.\u201d\nThey do.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDerek visits while Stiles is in the hospital\u2014always with other people, never alone. He's quiet and calm and he doesn't say much, but his presence is reassuring for some reason. Stiles gets a warm feeling in his chest, knowing that Derek cares if he's okay.\nSo maybe he does like him. A little bit. Or a lot.\nDerek watches him with these contemplative eyes, watches him like he's going to dissect him. He's trying to figure Stiles out.\nThe real crush kind of comes out of nowhere. One second, Derek is in the lab, bugging him about samples, they next, he's standing right next to Stiles, shoulders brushing, hips touching, pinkies separated by millimeters. And Stiles' heart surges up into his throat.\nWhen Derek leaves the lab that afternoon, Stiles thinks he's going to explode.\n\"You two look cozy,\" Lydia notes, but before Stiles can hiss something at her or make a beautifully sarcastic comment, Scott puts on his heavy frown and asks, \"Who?\"\n\"Nobody,\" Stiles grumbles. \"Lydia's overreacting.\"\n\"Stiles wants to get into Derek\u2019s pants,\u201d Lydia says like it\u2019s obvious.\u00a0 \u201cI know you\u2019re not as bright as I am Scott, but you should be noticing these things.\u201d\u00a0 She pats his cheek, grinning at him.\n\u201cDude,\u201d Scott breathes.\u00a0 \u201cDerek Hale?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, okay?\u00a0 We just\u2014I just\u2014there\u2019s nothing going on.\u201d\u00a0 Stiles turns back to his computer.\u00a0 \u201cNow go back to work.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a dude with a gun.\u00a0 But he\u2019s an idiot and it\u2019s a crime scene, so there are law enforcement officers a plenty and there\u2019s not really any danger, (Derek gets shot at and Stiles has a second of momentary panic but all\u2019s well that ends well or whatever) but Stiles can\u2019t help but feel that bad luck just keeps popping up.\nHe\u2019s right.\nThere\u2019s an incident involving a possibly toxic body and, just Stiles\u2019 luck, he\u2019s picking up evidence from autopsy just as they get locked in.\u00a0 They, meaning the doc, Erica, and Derek.\u00a0 And him.\u00a0 Because that\u2019s the way his life is now.\nThen there\u2019s evidence that\u2019s been handled improperly and Stiles has to use the emergency chemical showers\u2014along with the rest of the people in the lab.\u00a0 Derek is one of them.\nAll of those happen within the span of a month.\nBy the end of the those thirty days, though, Stiles thinks his luck must be changing.\nBecause Derek kisses him.\nGranted, it comes at a ridiculous inopportune moment, but it happens.\u00a0 It happens when they\u2019re exhausted and kind of dirty because they had to sift through evidence that involved lots and lots of stuff from trash bins and landfills, and it\u2019s Stiles who finds the missing puzzle piece, who figures it all out, and Derek hauls him in and kisses him.\nAt first, Stiles has no idea how to respond.\u00a0 But as soon as he realizes what\u2019s happening, he drops the vial of contact solution that\u2019s still caked in dirt\u2014don\u2019t ask\u2014and lets his arms rest on Derek\u2019s shoulders, kissing him back.\nIt\u2019s fucking awesome.\u00a0 Derek kisses him like he just can\u2019t stop, like he\u2019ll never stop, and Stiles takes and gives in equal succession, wishing he could shove his fingers through Derek\u2019s hair.\u00a0\nBut when it ends, it ends abruptly.\nDerek jerks away, hands still on Stiles\u2019 waist, leaving handprints on his white lab coat, and then he takes a step back, eyes wide and terrified.\u00a0 Stiles wants to say something, wants to tell him that it was okay, that it was more than okay, but he just can\u2019t make his mouth work, and so Derek bolts before he gets the chance to force his vocal chords back under his control.\nIsaac and Scott walk in a minute later, a donut box in Scott\u2019s hand, a jelly-filled monstrosity in Isaac\u2019s.\u00a0 When all Stiles does is stare at them blankly, Scott holds out the box.\u00a0 \u201cDonut?\u201d\nStiles scoffs.\u00a0 \u201cDonuts?!\u00a0 Scott\u2014priorities!\u201d\nAnd then he goes to his desk and starts planning.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlans, as it turns out, don\u2019t always work.\nHe\u2019s settled in for a nice long night of solitude\u2014it\u2019s raining, he has beer in the fridge, and he just wants to do absolutely nothing for an evening\u2014when the doorbell rings.\nHe grumbles.\u00a0 \u201cFucking Scott, you should at least call before\u2014Derek.\u201d\nDerek is standing on the other side of the threshold, drenched in rainwater.\n\u201c\u2026hi.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d is all Derek says, and then he\u2019s storming inside of Stiles\u2019 apartment, brushing past him like he\u2019s a part of the d\u00e9cor.\nStiles watches him as he steps inside, still dripping.\u00a0 \u201cYes, please,\u201d Stiles drawls sarcastically, \u201ccome into my home in your soaking clothes, uninvited I might add, and disrupt my lovely evening of horror movies and beer.\u201d\nDerek fixes him with a look.\u00a0 \u201cYou hate horror movies.\u201d\nStiles blinks.\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou said\u2014you said you couldn\u2019t watch them anymore because of your job.\u00a0 That they freaked you out too much.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014what\u2014how did you\u2014that was a private conversation!\u201d\n\u201cIn the middle of the lab.\u201d\n\u201cYou were working with Danny, how did you even\u2014oh.\u201d\u00a0 Stiles stands up a bit straighter.\u00a0 \u201cOh.\u00a0 You.\u00a0 You like me.\u201d\nFor a second, Stiles expects Derek to scowl and deny it, but all he does is stand there.\u00a0 When Stiles doesn\u2019t come up with anything else to say, Derek clears his throat, runs a hand through his still-dripping hair.\u00a0 \u201cDo you think maybe I could use your shower?\u201d\nStiles nods after a moment.\u00a0 \u201cYes.\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 Yeah.\u201d\nHe\u2019s kind of numb as he waits, draining the rest of his bottle, standing by the couch and tapping his fingers over the back of it.\u00a0 For as strange as he feels, he\u2019s also vastly disappointed.\nHe had a plan.\nFucking Derek.\nHe\u2019d like to blame the beer for what happens next, but then that would be giving too much of the credit away.\u00a0 But he still wonders if a more sober brain would have been able to avoid the temptation to stomp into the bathroom and yank the curtain back\u2014he doesn\u2019t get to dwell on the question for long.\nDerek is really fucking hot.\u00a0 Stiles knows this.\u00a0 Stiles remembers undressing him in the lab, remembers the fluttery feeling in his stomach, but this is, obviously, different.\u00a0 Because Derek really does have a phenomenal ass and Stiles is in love.\u00a0 Probably.\u00a0 Most definitely.\u00a0 Shit.\nDerek blinks at him from under the spray, not making a move to cover himself, not telling Stiles to get out, but waiting, letting Stiles decide.\u00a0 He keeps his eyes fixed on Stiles\u2019 as Stiles undresses himself.\u00a0 He stares as Stiles steps into the bathtub, watches as he moves forward.\n\u201cI had a plan,\u201d Stiles says dumbly.\u00a0 \u201cI had a really fucking great plan.\u201d\nDerek nods slowly.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sure you did.\u201d\n\u201cI was gonna romance the fuck out of you.\u00a0 I was leave you silly shit on your desk and try to embarrass you when you came down to the lab, be all lovey dovey and crap like that\u2014I was going to make you fall head over heels for me.\u201d\n\u201cStiles.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou already have.\u201d\nAnd then they\u2019re kissing.\u00a0 And it\u2019s better than the first time; Derek is touching him and Stiles gets to touch Derek and it\u2019s just so much.\u00a0 They kiss for a really long time, just stand under the steamy spray and kiss, and Stiles feels like he\u2019s in college again, too nervous to make the first move and having too much fun with the simple stuff that he isn\u2019t even sure he wants to move on.\n\u201cRelax,\u201d Derek whispers.\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2014just tell me what you want.\u201d\n\u201cYou.\u201d\u00a0 Stiles kisses him again.\u00a0 \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d\u00a0 He reaches around Derek and turns off the water, and by the time they make it to bed, they\u2019re still a little damp, barely helped by the towels Derek had wrapped them in.\nThey neck like teenagers.\u00a0 They lounge around and make out, run their hands all over each other, and just as Stiles is about to claim blue balls and grab for his own cock, Derek starts sliding down his body, licking and sucking and leaving hickies in his wake.\nStiles can hardly remember the last time he had a blowjob.\u00a0 Derek\u2019s mouth, though, completely wipes any and all memories of past events from his head, because it\u2019s just so fucking awesome.\u00a0 Stiles can\u2019t do anything but force his hips to be still and tug on Derek\u2019s hair for strength.\n\u201cFuck\u2014stop\u2014stop that\u2014get up here.\u201d\u00a0 He grabs at Derek\u2019s shoulders desperately, but Derek doesn\u2019t move.\u00a0 Or rather, he does, but it\u2019s only to take Stiles deeper into his mouth, into his throat.\u00a0 Eventually, after a minute or two of babbling, Stiles just gives up.\u00a0 Just collapses.\u00a0 Just breathes and moans and lets his hips move in little circles and enjoys it, because if Derek wants this, then he supposes he can sacrifice enough to give it to him.\nHe has enough brain power to warn Derek before he\u2019s about to come, but right as he opens his mouth, Derek pulls off.\nStiles lets out a litany of cuss words and Derek just grins at him, nuzzling his belly.\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Stiles mutters, \u201cyou\u2019re adorable.\u00a0 Big bad FBI agent turns into a kitten after blowjobs\u2014and giving, no less.\u00a0 Wow, that\u2019s actually awesome.\u00a0 Can I keep you?\u201d\nDerek kisses the skin around his bellybutton and nods.\u00a0 \u201cPlease.\u201d He surges up to kiss Stiles again, and at the same time reaches over to fumble around and get Stiles\u2019 bedside drawer open.\u00a0 \u201cLube?\u201d he asks as he searches.\nStiles moans.\u00a0 \u201cYeah\u2014yeah, it\u2019s in there.\u00a0 And\u2014condom.\u201d\n\u201cCan I fuck you?\u201d\nHe nods quickly, arching up against him.\u00a0 \u201cPlease, please do.\u201d\nDerek kisses him when he slides the first finger in, kisses him deep and long and slow, kisses him until Stiles is shaking, babbling against his mouth with pleas for another.\u00a0 So Derek pushes in another, and another, fucks him with those fingers watches his eyes slip closed, mouth fall open, head fall back.\nStiles can barely concentrate.\u00a0 He knows that he digs his fingers into Derek\u2019s shoulders, knows that eventually he reaches down starts jerking Derek off, knows that they touch and that they never stop kissing\u2014his lips are definitely going to be chapped in the morning\u2014but beyond all of that, the only thing Stiles can register is how good it all feels.\u00a0 And how badly he needs to come.\nHe rolls the condom on Derek himself, hooks his knees around Derek\u2019s waist, and when Derek is inside of him, Stiles takes back everything he ever said about stupidly attractive FBI agents.\nDerek chuckles.\u00a0 \u201cOh, yeah?\u201d he asks.\u00a0 \u201cLike what?\u201d\nStiles smirks to himself, not even sorry that he said it out loud.\u00a0 \u201cLike how you guys must suck in bed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re only just getting started.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2014still got time to prove me wrong.\u201d\nHe does.\u00a0 Derek is long and thick and Stiles would feel slightly inadequate (actually, when he thinks about it, they\u2019re fairly similar in size) if he wasn\u2019t so grateful.\u00a0 Derek fucks him and holds him, licks over his nipples, rolls them between his fingers, sucks on his neck and licks over his collarbone.\u00a0 He does everything Stiles could ever want, and leads Stiles\u2019 hands and mouth to show him how he likes to be touched and kissed, too.\nStiles spends a lot of time scraping his nails down Derek\u2019s back\u2014he did it once when Derek pushed in and Derek had moaned so beautifully that he just can\u2019t help himself\u2014and sucking on Derek\u2019s pulse point and kissing the sandpaper-like cheeks and jaw that make Derek look like a hunky badass with a personal vendetta against razor burn.\nStiles loves it.\u00a0 And he\u2019s fairly certain that Derek does too.\n\u201cI have to,\u201d Derek pants into his mouth, rhythm crashing and thrusts going erratic.\u00a0 \u201cI have to come\u2014come on, Stiles, come for me.\u201d\nStiles does, without much effort he might add, and he feels like everything is exploding, bright and hot and wonderful, and when he comes down, Derek is twitching inside him, still holding himself up on his elbows and knees.\nWith a laugh, Stiles shoves Derek onto his back and goes about cleaning them up.\n\u201cThey train you for this kind of stuff at the FBI?\u201d Stiles teases.\u00a0 \u201cHow to not land on your partner after they make you come your brains out?\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes are closed, but he smiles.\u00a0 \u201cStiles.\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nStiles snorts.\u00a0 \u201cAny time, Agent Hale.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes open then, and he reaches forward to grab Stiles\u2019 hand, twisting their fingers together.\u00a0 \u201cHey.\u00a0 I mean\u2014thank you.\u00a0 For everything.\u00a0 I\u2026\u00a0 You know.\u201d\nAnd the thing is, Stiles does know.\u00a0 Stiles knows because he can see the way Derek is looking at him.\u00a0 He can feel it in the way Derek touches him, taste it on the puffiness of his lips, sense it in the aches of his thoroughly-loved body.\nHe feels\u2026good.\u00a0 And he knows Derek made him that way.\nStiles leans down to kiss him again.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere aren\u2019t any official rules at the FBI about dating.\u00a0 Agents date.\u00a0 Analysts date computer techs, computer techs date forensic techs, it\u2019s all a mess, and none of it really\u2026matters.\nDerek, apparently, is the only one who decides to make it a big deal.\nDerek stayed the weekend, cooked them breakfast on Monday, and then licked into Stiles\u2019 mouth as he asked if he could stay over that night, too.\u00a0 But before Stiles can answer, they get the call.\n\u201cFucking fuck,\u201d Stiles hisses, pulling out his own cell phone as Derek reaches for his.\u00a0 \u201cStilinski.\u201d\n\u201cHale.\u201d\nThey do not commute to the crime scene together, not that Stiles thought they would, but it is a little surprising that, when they arrive, Derek doesn\u2019t even glance at him.\u00a0 He settles straight into his work and Stiles wanders off to find Lydia and pull on his gloves.\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Stiles greets her.\u00a0 She\u2019s sitting in the back of the van, trading her high heels for boots.\u00a0 She has a pink donut box by her side.\u00a0 \u201cOh, donuts.\u201d\nShe slaps his hand away when he reaches for one.\u00a0 \u201cNot yours.\u00a0 They\u2019re for the ME.\u201d\nStiles arches an eyebrow.\u00a0 \u201cSeducing him?\u00a0 You know, Lydia, I\u2019ve seen your bad taste in men but I gotta say, he\u2019s like 90 and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s married.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d she sighs, rolling her eyes.\u00a0 \u201cYou know we always get those interns right around this time of year and I\u2019m hoping I can bribe him enough that out of the five interns our department gets, he\u2019ll take at least three of them, if not more.\u201d\nStiles frowns.\u00a0 \u201cI like interns.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a really weird year, Stiles.\u201d\u00a0 Lydia finishes lacing up her boots and double checks her gloves.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I just feel like we can\u2019t take any chances.\u201d\nStiles shrugs to himself as she walks off to check out the body, and he\u2019s about to follow her when he realizes\u2014\n\u201cScott, what the hell are you doing in the ME van?\u201d\nHe\u2019s sitting up front, leaning over a cell phone.\u00a0 He looks slightly horrified, and he doesn\u2019t appear to have heard Stiles.\n\u201cDude?\u201d\nHe thumps his hand against the side of the van and Scott perks up, turning around.\u00a0 \u201cOh.\u00a0 Oh, Stiles, hi!\u00a0 I\u2014wow, hi.\u201d\nStiles arches an eyebrow.\u00a0 \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah, sure, everything\u2019s just totally peachy, absolutely.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Scott, what are you\u2014\u201d\u00a0 But before Stiles can finish the question, a voice calls, \u201cDr. Stilinski!\u201d and Stiles sighs, turning towards Erica.\u00a0 \u201cHowdy, Agent Reyes,\u201d he drawls pleasantly, smiling at her.\u00a0 \u201cHow are you this fine Monday morning?\u201d\nShe\u2019s smirking.\u00a0 \u201cOh, you know me.\u00a0 Sunshine and rainbows.\u00a0 Dr. Martin requests your assistance.\u201d\nSo Stiles casts one last look back at Scott\u2014who looks like he did in fourth grade when he accidentally fed his hamster rat poison\u2014and marches over to Lydia, and if he gives Derek an appreciative look upon his arrival, it\u2019s not really a problem, right?\u00a0 Right?\n\u201c\u2014what looks like remnants of a\u2014Stiles, are you paying attention?\u201d\nStiles nods, looking away from Derek and helping Lydia bag evidence. \u201cOf course.\u201d\nLydia smirks at him.\u00a0 \u201cIs there something you\u2019d like to share with the class, Stiles?\u201d she coos.\u00a0 Erica and Boyd are already walking back towards the van, but Derek is still standing on the other side of the body.\nDerek clears his throat.\u00a0 \u201cDr. Martin, the particles are yours, but do make sure the ME gets everything he needs as well.\u201d\n\u201cAye, aye, Captain.\u201d\u00a0 She even gives him a little salute, and he walks away without even glancing at Stiles.\nOuch.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with Grumpy Face?\u201d Lydia asks him.\u00a0 \u201cI thought he was starting to get better.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u00a0 So did I.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIntern with Danny,\u201d Isaac says under his breath when Stiles, Lydia, and Scott walk back into the lab.\u201d\nLydia perks up.\u00a0 \u201cJust one?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u00a0 We only got three this year and Dr. Dead People said he\u2019d take two.\u201d\u00a0 Isaac gestures to the back where the intern in leaning against Danny\u2019s desk, holding a camera they use to snap pictures of evidence.\u00a0 \u201cMatt Phillips.\u00a0 Good transcript.\u00a0 Knows his chemicals and shit.\u00a0 Stick him with Stiles, no one gets hurt.\u201d\nIt\u2019s routine.\u00a0 Since Stiles doesn\u2019t mind them all that much and they do his busy work for him, he\u2019s usually the one who has to baby them.\u00a0 He shrugs.\u00a0 \u201cSure,\u201d he tells Lydia, \u201cI\u2019ll take him.\u201d\nHe goes through quick introductions and settles the kid in front of the computer to upload the newest pictures from the crime scene that morning.\u00a0 Then, he marches upstairs to have words.\n\u201cGood morning, Dr. Stilinski,\u201d Boyd greets him when he gets to the squad room.\u00a0 Derek\u2019s the only other person there\u2014Erica must be running an errand\u2014and he only barely looks up.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you have news already?\u201d\nStiles simply crosses his arms over his chest and looks at Derek.\n\u201cGo check on Erica,\u201d Derek grumbles to Boyd.\u00a0 \u201cMake sure she hasn\u2019t killed the intern.\u201d\nBoyd hesitates a moment, but when Derek fixes him with a look, he nods and leaves.\n\u201cWhat the fuck, Derek.\u201d\nDerek blinks up at him.\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend like you don\u2019t know\u2014you\u2019ve been ignoring me all morning.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyebrows shoot up.\u00a0 \u201cStiles.\u00a0 We\u2019re at work.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your point?\u201d\n\u201cMy point!\u201d\u00a0 Derek looks left and right, but no one wandering around seems to be paying any attention to them.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be\u2014professionals.\u00a0 And I can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d\u00a0 He gestures aimlessly, and drops his hands to his desk.\u00a0 \u201cWe can\u2019t interact inappropriately whilst at work.\u201d\nStiles feels like throwing something.\u00a0 \u201cWow.\u00a0 Wow, you must be shitting me.\u201d\n\u201cStiles\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo one is going to be able to tell that we\u2019re together simply because you look at me or say a single word to me.\u201d\u00a0 He leans over Derek\u2019s desk, palms flat.\u00a0 \u201cYou were nicer to me when we weren\u2019t together so I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s a little something more at play here than an attempt to do your job.\u201d\u00a0 He tilts his head, narrowing his eyes.\u00a0 \u201cTalk.\u201d\nDerek blinks.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\nWith a sigh, Derek stands, grabbing Stiles\u2019 wrist and yanking him towards the elevators.\u00a0 As soon as they\u2019re inside, Derek flips the emergency stop switch and the movement halts, the elevator lights dimming.\n\u201cLittle over dramatic,\u201d Stiles mumbles.\n\u201cI panicked,\u201d Derek tells him.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t give you the right to ignore me.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u00a0 I\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0 Stiles.\u201d\u00a0 He grabs Stiles\u2019 shoulders, waits until Stiles is looking at him evenly and then moves his hands to Stiles\u2019 neck, leaning in closer.\u00a0 \u201cWe can\u2019t\u2014not at work.\u201d\nStiles smirks.\u00a0 \u201cWhy do I get the feeling this is more about enjoyment derived from sneaking around than it is about professionalism?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t tell your friends.\u00a0 Tell anyone you want, but we need to save this for\u2026\u201d\u00a0 He licks his lips, leans in closer.\u00a0 \u201cJust us.\u00a0 Okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d\u00a0 Stiles closes the thin gap between them, kissing him slowly.\u00a0 \u201cFuck, you\u2019re awesome.\u00a0 Ung, do you have to go back to work?\u00a0 Wanna go down to Autopsy and fool around in the walk-in freezer?\u201d\nDerek chuckles, kissing him one last time.\u00a0 \u201cGo back to the lab.\u00a0 Do your job.\u201d\n\u201cFine, but I\u2019m living off the promise that I\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d\n\u201cTonight.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAllison\u2019s pregnant.\u201d\nStiles looks up from his microscope and blinks at Scott, who\u2019s standing in front of him looking like a poodle who really needs to pee.\u00a0 When the weight of the statement settles into Stiles\u2019 brain, he glances behind him to make sure the intern is still working with his headphones plugged in.\n\u201cDude,\u201d Scott hisses, setting forward.\u00a0 His voice drops.\u00a0 \u201cAllison\u2019s pregnant.\u201d\nStiles licks his lips.\u00a0 \u201cYeah, man, I heard you.\u00a0 I\u2014I don\u2019t know what to say.\u00a0 Don\u2019t you use condoms?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2014I\u2014last month\u2014\u201d He\u2019s obviously flustered and he scrapes a hand through his hair, dropping onto the seat next to the counter.\u00a0 \u201cYes.\u00a0 We use condoms.\u00a0 We just got\u2026carried away.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s an adult,\u201d Stiles reminds him.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re 16.\u00a0 She\u2019s financially and emotionally capable of\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not!\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s not about you, is it.\u201d\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t say it like a question.\u00a0 It\u2019s not one.\u00a0 He reaches forward and grabs his best friend\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0 \u201cYour girlfriend is pregnant.\u00a0 She decides what to do, not you.\u00a0 If she wants to keep it, then you support her.\u00a0 If she doesn\u2019t want to keep it, then you support her with that too.\u201d\nScott looks shell shocked.\u00a0 \u201cHoly shit.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou got laid.\u201d\nStiles rolls his eyes.\u00a0 \u201cFuck you.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2014dude, I\u2019m serious\u2014you are never this\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cCalm!\u201d\u00a0 Scott groans, flopping his head down next to the microscope.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m never going to have sex again.\u201d\nStiles shrugs.\u00a0 \u201cWell, if you do, make sure you use a love glove.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be silly, cover your willy.\u201d\n\u201cI would say you\u2019re no help at all except that it wouldn\u2019t be true.\u201d\u00a0 Scott stands, patting Stiles\u2019 back.\u00a0 \u201cThanks, man.\u201d\n\u201cAnytime, bro.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThings fall apart shortly after that.\u00a0 But, as there is so often, there\u2019s a calm before the storm that numbs them all into a sense of security.\nThere are cases and they catch murderers.\u00a0 They go through four court cases in a month and a half and Stiles testifies at all of them.\u00a0 He works, he eats, he goes home.\u00a0 Sometimes Derek\u2019s there, sometimes he\u2019s not.\nStiles falls in love with him.\u00a0 Hard.\u00a0 The silly crush that made him feel all warm and gooey inside develops, and when Stiles falls asleep without Derek next to him, he feels empty inside.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go away this weekend,\u201d Stiles whispers to Derek.\u00a0 They\u2019re standing in the lab, looking at a computer screen, and everyone\u2019s off doing their own jobs.\u00a0 Phillips is sitting in his corner copying paperwork, headphones in his ears.\u00a0 \u201cC\u2019mon, you need time off, too.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not scheduled to be working this weekend.\u201d\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d\u00a0 Stiles bumps his shoulder against Derek\u2019s.\u00a0 \u201cWant to drive up to LA?\u00a0 Stay in an expensive hotel, order room service, spend all weekend in bed?\u201d\n\u201cSounds too good to be true.\u201d\u00a0 Derek smiles at him, looking over his shoulder at the intern.\u00a0 When he\u2019s comfortable with their privacy, he leans in for a short kiss, brushing his hand across the small of Stiles\u2019 back.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\nStiles works late, as usual.\u00a0 He sits in the lab, works until he can\u2019t see the screen properly anymore, and then glances over his shoulder to see that Matt is still there.\n\u201cDoing okay, kid?\u201d he asks.\nBut he can kind of tell that there\u2019s a problem.\u00a0 Matt is shaking, or at least his hands are.\nBefore Stiles can ask him again, there\u2019s a knock at the door of the lab.\u00a0 Allison is standing in the doorway, dressed in her usual pantsuit, a coat folded over her arm.\u00a0 She smiles at Stiles.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he greets her.\u00a0 \u201cScott\u2019s in the back.\u00a0 Matt can show you.\u201d\u00a0 He stands, picking up the boxed gun that they\u2019re still trying to prove was the murder weapon in the most recent horrifying homicide.\u00a0 He hands the box to Matt, jerking his head towards Scott\u2019s station.\u00a0 \u201cTake this back to him, will you?\u201d\nMatt doesn\u2019t speak.\u00a0 Allison follows him towards the back, waving at Stiles.\nIt isn\u2019t until Derek comes bursting in that Stiles realizes something\u2019s wrong.\n\u201cStiles!\u201d he shouts.\u00a0 He yanks Stiles up out of his chair, holding onto his shoulders.\u00a0 \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nStiles pulls a face.\u00a0 \u201cUm.\u00a0 Yes?\u00a0 I\u2014what?\u00a0 What are you doing down here?\u201d\nDerek frowns.\u00a0 \u201cI got your text.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t send you a text.\u201d\u00a0 Stiles makes to grab for his phone to prove it\u2014only his pocket is empty.\n\u201cStiles.\u201d\u00a0 Derek scrolls to the page on his phone, showing him where his number pops up, with only a three-letter message underneath.\u00a0 S. O. S.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014I didn\u2019t send that.\u00a0 I promise.\u201d\n\u201cSo then\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Derek stands up straight.\u00a0 \u201cSo then who did?\u201d\n\u201cThat,\u201d comes a voice from the door, behind Derek now, having moved around him while he was distracted, \u201cwould be me.\u201d\u00a0 Matt is standing there, still in his lab coat, holding the gun that Stiles had given him moments before, along with the cartridge.\u00a0 The door is closed.\u00a0 Matt reaches down and locks it.\u00a0 \u201cHey, Agent Hale.\u00a0 Nice to see you again.\u201d\nStiles wants to close his eyes.\u00a0 Wants to pinch himself.\u00a0 He\u2019s had way too many creeps ruining his life lately, and he definitely doesn\u2019t need another one.\u00a0 But apparently he doesn\u2019t get a choice.\n\u201cDo I know you?\u201d Derek asks coldly.\n\u201cI\u2019m hurt,\u201d Matt says, a sick smile coming to his face.\u00a0 \u201cYour memory needs a little work.\u201d\nStiles glances over to his left where Scott, Allison, and Lydia have congregated, the only ones left in the lab.\u00a0 Scott and Allison are handcuffed together, no doubt by Matt.\nMatt holds out a hand.\u00a0 \u201cYour weapon, please, Agent Hale.\u00a0 And no one gets hurt.\u201d\u00a0 Derek lifts his hands slowly, reaching for it, but apparently Matt decides against this course of action at the last minute.\u00a0 \u201cWait,\u201d he says.\u00a0 \u201cYou.\u201d\u00a0 He points the gun at Lydia, his eyes never leaving Derek\u2019s.\u00a0 \u201cGet the gun from him.\u00a0 And don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d\nLydia doesn\u2019t look scared.\u00a0 If anything, she looks pissed, but she does as she\u2019s told, and Matt unloads the gun, tossing it towards the back, crashing into the door that leads towards Danny and Isaac\u2019s space.\n\u201cThere we go,\u201d Matt says.\u00a0 \u201cNow you two.\u201d\u00a0 He points to Allison and Scott.\u00a0 \u201cPush the table up against the door.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s the table with Stiles\u2019 mass spectrometer on it.\u00a0 Stiles feels like he\u2019s offering a child up for slaughter, but it\u2019s heavy enough that it\u2019ll be frustrating to anyone who might want to enter the room.\nThen again, it\u2019s nearly eleven o\u2019clock at night.\u00a0 It\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll have visitors.\n\u201cAnd last but hardly least,\u201d Matt drawls when Scott and Allison walk back and hover behind Stiles\u2019 station.\u00a0 He shoots at the security camera hooked over the door.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t make a noise as it dies.\u00a0 \u201cWonderful\u2014shall we get started?\u201d\nHe takes their wallets and their phones, shuts them off and places them on the evidence table.\u00a0 Stiles and Derek are standing on one side of the station that holds all of Stiles\u2019 equipment and computers; Allison, Scott, and Lydia are on the other.\nStiles is waiting, his breath uneven, for something to happen\u2014anything.\u00a0 Because usually this would be the time in which Derek did something majorly badass and saved all of their lives.\u00a0 But Derek isn\u2019t moving.\n\u201cI know you,\u201d Derek says softly.\nMatt smirks at him.\u00a0 \u201cYeah, Agent Hale.\u00a0 I know.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d\nMatt shrugs.\u00a0 \u201cGuess you\u2019ll have to figure it out.\u201d\n\u201cIf I\u2019m the target, why are you keeping all of them in here?\u201d Derek asks.\u00a0 His hands are stuffed in his trouser pockets.\u00a0 He looks relaxed.\u00a0 \u201cYou waited until I was down here to lock us in.\u00a0 I\u2019m obviously important somehow.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get cocky.\u201d\nDerek shrugs.\u00a0 \u201cJust trying to work it out in my head.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d\u00a0 He steadies the gun, aiming straight at Derek.\u00a0 \u201cNobody move.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not moving.\u201d\u00a0 Derek looks towards Stiles.\u00a0 \u201cAre you moving, Dr. Stilinski?\u201d\nStiles sucks in a breath.\u00a0 \u201cNot to my knowledge, Agent Hale, but I didn\u2019t take my Adderall this morning, so.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Matt hisses.\u00a0 \u201cJust\u2014shut up.\u201d\nStiles notices a flinch from the other side of the station.\nThere\u2019s a gunshot.\u00a0 Stiles flinches on instinct, preparing himself for pain, but he feels nothing, and all he hears is a scream.\u00a0 From Allison.\nLydia is on her in an instant, wadding up her lab coat and pressing it to the injury on her inner thigh.\n\u201cEveryone shut up!\u201d Matt screams.\u00a0 \u201cGet back!\u201d\n\u201cWe need to stop the bleeding,\u201d Lydia tells him, not even looking at him.\u00a0 Scott is sitting on the floor with Allison, behind her, holding her, and she\u2019s tearing up, hand over Lydia\u2019s as blood soaks into the lab coat.\u00a0 \u201cWe need to keep pressure on it.\u00a0 Scott, hold it.\u201d\nHe does, and his hands over Allison\u2019s tremble.\nStiles looks at Derek, looking for a sign that he\u2019s still calm, that he\u2019s still not worried, but whatever mask Derek had been wearing a moment earlier is gone.\u00a0 He\u2019s scared now, too.\u00a0 Scared for them.\n\u201cGet up,\u201d Matt growls at Lydia, yanking on her arm and pulling her away from them.\nStiles feels sick.\n\u201cI told you I\u2019d shoot\u2014shut up and don\u2019t move.\u201d\nHe\u2019s visibly upset, Stiles can tell, and he has his eyes on Derek almost all the time.\u00a0 He\u2019s the biggest threat, even if he has given up his weapon.\nStiles moves before his brain really decides to, needing to be closer to Derek, and he pays for it.\u00a0 He staggers backwards when the bullet hits his shoulder, and he knows he cries out in pain, but he doesn\u2019t fall, mostly because Derek rushes to hold onto him.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Stiles hisses.\u00a0 \u201cShot twice in one year\u2014fuck my life.\u201d\n\u201cI said don\u2019t move!\u201d Matt screams.\u00a0 \u201cHow hard is that for you people to understand?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019d be easier if you weren\u2019t threatening the people we love,\u201d Lydia spits at him.\u00a0 \u201cThis is why I fucking hate interns.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem, dude?\u201d Stiles asks as Derek eases him down onto the floor, holding his suit jacket over the wound in his shoulder.\u00a0 \u201cGot a beef with forensic techs and annoyingly attractive FBI agents?\u201d\nHe\u2019s shaking and sweating and obviously upset, but what comes out of his mouth is the most surprising thing, beyond the fact that he obviously had no real plan.\u00a0 \u201cMy real name isn\u2019t Phillips\u2014it\u2019s Daehler.\u201d\u00a0 His eyes bore into Stiles\u2019.\u00a0 \u201cThat give you any clue?\u201d\nStiles blinks, leans back against Derek and tries not to cry because everything really freaking hurts. \u201cUh.\u00a0 No?\u201d\n\u201cHe was convicted of manslaughter,\u201d Derek says.\u00a0 \u201cFour years ago, my testimony\u2026\u201d\u00a0 He hesitates.\u00a0 \u201cHe let two of his high school friends drown and was convicted of stalking and threatening one of their sisters after the incident.\u00a0 She wound up dead, evidence of rape was found.\u00a0 He was the number one suspect.\u00a0 He was acquitted of the murder charge but the stalking charge went on his record, along with physical harassment.\u00a0 He served nine months.\u201d\n\u201cYou ruined my life!\u201d he shouts, still waving the gun.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a scumbag,\u201d Allison says from the other side of the room, looking pale and sickly.\u00a0 \u201cShould\u2019ve been locked up.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the victim!\u00a0 Me!\u00a0 I\u2019m the one\u2014they tried to drown me!\u201d\u00a0 He scowls darkly.\u00a0 \u201cAnd that bitch made up lies about me.\u00a0 She swore up and down that it was my fault even though she saw the whole thing happen.\u201d\n\u201cTaking your anger out on innocent people,\u201d Derek spits.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re really not setting yourself up for a successful future, Matt.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to relate to me.\u00a0 I see it\u2014I\u2019ve seen how this works.\u00a0 You say my name and you try to talk to me.\u201d\u00a0 He raises the gun again, pointing straight at\u2014Stiles.\u00a0 \u201cIf you say my name again, I\u2019ll put a bullet in his other shoulder.\u00a0 But who knows?\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019m a lousy shot.\u00a0 I could accidentally hit his heart.\u201d\nStiles closes his eyes tight, holding onto Derek\u2019s arm.\u00a0 He feels numb.\u00a0 And cold.\nAllison moans out in pain and when Stiles opens his eyes, he can see her leaning her forehead into Scott\u2019s neck.\n\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant,\u201d Stiles says immediately.\u00a0 \u201cThe rest of us\u2014we\u2019ll all stay, we\u2019ll do whatever you want, but you have to let her go.\u00a0 She\u2019s pregnant.\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Scott starts.\n\u201cNo one\u2019s leaving,\u201d Matt hisses.\u00a0 \u201cNot until Derek Hale\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\u201cLacking a bit of finesse, that plan,\u201d Stiles says through his teeth.\u00a0 He\u2019s trembling.\u00a0 He feels really, really tired.\u00a0 \u201cCould\u2019ve just slipped something in his food.\u00a0 Shot him as soon as you walked in.\u00a0 Why\u2019d you have to wait?\u00a0 Why are you waiting now?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s more than that.\u201d\u00a0 Matt steps closer, pressing the barrel of the gun against Stiles\u2019 cheek.\u00a0 \u201cBecause he didn\u2019t just take away my life, he took away the people I loved.\u00a0 My family, my only friends.\u00a0 They all shunned me after that trial.\u00a0 Nobody cared.\u00a0 And I wonder what Derek Hale would do if he knew that there was no one left in the world for him to love.\u201d\nStiles shudders.\u00a0 \u201cKilling him won\u2019t make him feel that way.\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says lowly.\n\u201cI doubt killing any of us would, either,\u201d Stiles continues.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re lab rats.\u00a0 Derek doesn\u2019t give two shits about us.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not as dumb as I look, Dr. Stilinski.\u201d\u00a0 Matt starts pacing then, walking around the evidence table and pulling it backwards on its wheels, moving it towards the rest of the barricade at the door.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m observant.\u00a0 I hear things.\u00a0 I see things.\u00a0 I know whatever you two are doing, it isn\u2019t exactly kosher.\u00a0 But, hey, you guys make a cute couple.\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s stepped closer then, but at a new angle.\u00a0 This time, he\u2019s not also facing the corner where the others are huddled.\u00a0 This time, his back is to them.\nStiles licks his lips.\u00a0 He knows his heart rate is increasing and he knows what that means\u2014blood pumping faster, he loses blood faster.\u00a0 Allison is already in a sorry state.\n\u201cLet me get bandages,\u201d Lydia asks, already standing up.\u00a0 \u201cPlease\u2014she\u2019s losing blood.\u00a0 They both are.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Matt grinds out.\u00a0 \u201cNobody move.\u00a0 God, how many times\u2014\u201d\u00a0 And then Lydia smacks him over the back of his head with her wedge-heeled shoe, and he drops, crumpling on the floor like a ragdoll.\nShe doesn\u2019t glance at him, just rushes towards the back, grabs bandages and gauze and towels, and meanwhile she\u2019s barking orders, Stiles thinks, but he can\u2019t really tell, because he\u2019s so tired that he\u2019s decided to just take a nap against Derek\u2019s shoulder.\nIt\u2019s very comfy.\n\u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep,\u201d Derek says, running his hand through Stiles\u2019 hair.\u00a0 \u201cHey.\u00a0 Don\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d\nStiles nuzzles into him.\u00a0 \u201cDerek.\u201d\n\u201cStiles, c\u2019mon, you have to stay awake, dammit, Stiles\u2014\u201d\nAnd then everything fades to black.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEverything\u2019s fuzzy for a while.\u00a0 It\u2019s thick and hazy and Stiles isn\u2019t aware of a lot.\nThe first time he wakes up, he hears shouting and rushing and Derek\u2019s voice, distantly.\u00a0 But everything hurts, so he decides to go back to sleep, where it doesn\u2019t.\nThe second time, his mouth is dry and his eyelids are too heavy to open.\u00a0 So he doesn\u2019t try.\u00a0 He just breathes deeply through the fog in his head and goes back to sleep.\u00a0 When he wakes up again, he can hear someone else in the room.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t open his eyes and he\u2019s back asleep in an instant.\nFourth, fifth, sixth times he wakes up, he hears voices.\u00a0 Lydia, Scott, Isaac.\u00a0 One time, he hears Erica.\nHe goes back to sleep.\nWhen he finally comes to\u2014at a point when he feels like he might as well be dead\u2014the hospital is dark.\u00a0 He\u2019s in a simple private room, which is strange, and through the glass window in the door, he can see that the lights are low.\nIt\u2019s the night shift.\nHe wants to rub at his eyes, wipe away the sleep and the frustration, but his arms feel heavy.\n\u201cMorphine.\u201d\u00a0 Stiles blinks up at the nurse who walks in the door, her face set in a kind smile.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve been pumping it into you for a while, it\u2019s going to take a bit for you to feel like yourself again.\u201d \u00a0She looks down at the chart and back up at him.\u00a0 \u201cHello, Dr. Stilinski.\u00a0 Welcome back to the land of the conscious.\u201d\nHe cracks a smile.\u00a0 \u201cHow long have I been sleeping?\u00a0 Do I have a new record?\u00a0 One time, in college, I slept for nearly twenty hours straight.\u201d\nShe nods, dropping the clipboard in a holder at the end of his bed.\u00a0 \u201cThree days.\u00a0 You were touch and go for a while, I\u2019m sorry to say, but your surgery went fine and we\u2019ve just been waiting for your body to feel like helping us out a little bit.\u201d\u00a0 She clicks her nails against the foot of his bed.\u00a0 \u201cVisiting hours are long over,\u201d she explains, \u201cbut your friends have been here all the time and it\u2019s different for law enforcement personnel.\u00a0 They all are, uh, interesting.\u2019\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s one word.\u00a0 My friends definitely have interesting attitudes.\u201d\n\u201cSince it\u2019s almost daybreak, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one of them returned soon.\u201d\u00a0 She checks her pretty silver watch.\u00a0 \u201cThe tall, gruff one with the sad eyes\u2014he comes in every morning, leaves 18 hours later.\u00a0 He\u2019s here more than I am.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 pulse races just a little bit and her eyes flash to the monitor.\nShe smirks.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s handsome.\u201d\nStiles smiles again.\u00a0 \u201cYeah.\u00a0 Yeah, he is.\u201d\nThere are ice chips for him to suck on and someone (probably Lydia), left a pile of three books on the little nightstand.\u00a0 There\u2019s also a folded piece of paper with his name written on it.\nWhen Stiles looks up, the nurse is gone.\n\u00a0\nStiles\u2014\nIf you wake up when none of us are here (and you so would, because that\u2019s just how you work), there are probably some things you\u2019re wondering.\nI won\u2019t go into detail about the surgery, since I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t care that much, but the good news is you\u2019re alive and your arm will be fine.\u00a0 The doctor thinks physical therapy might be necessary because of damage to the nerve and the socket joint, but I highly doubt it.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen your x-rays.\nAllison miscarried.\u00a0 She and Scott are fine otherwise, if a little upset, and Derek\u2019s okay, too.\u00a0 He\u2019s pissed, and he\u2019s by your side more than any of us, but he\u2019s fine.\nDerek called your father.\u00a0 He flew down to see you and he\u2019s staying in your apartment since the hospital won\u2019t let him stay, but he\u2019s around with Derek.\u00a0 Between you and me, I think he knows that you and Derek are more than coworkers.\nYou have been unbelievably brave, Stiles.\u00a0 Thank you.\nWe\u2019ll see you when you wake up.\n\u2014Lydia\n\u00a0\nHe breathes a little easier when he\u2019s done reading the letter.\u00a0 He\u2019s not happy that his dad flew all the way down, but he\u2019s relieved that Derek\u2019s been around.\u00a0 He feels sick when he thinks about Allison and Scott.\u00a0 Nothing is ever going to make that go away.\nHe hears the footsteps before he actually sees the person, but he smiles when he does.\n\u201cI hear that someone\u2019s been upsetting the other half of the Hale family for about, oh, three days.\u201d\u00a0 Laura closes the door behind her, a cup of coffee in one hand, the other curled around the strap of her purse.\u00a0 \u201cHow long have you been awake?\u201d\n\u201cTwenty minutes.\u201d\u00a0 He licks his lips.\u00a0 \u201cIs Derek\u2026?\u201d\nLaura smirks.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s on his way.\u00a0 I told him I\u2019d drop in before I headed to work.\u00a0 You okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you know.\u201d\u00a0 He refrains from shrugging.\u00a0 The morphine\u2019s wearing off and his shoulder hurts.\u00a0 \u201cBreathing, so that\u2019s a plus.\u201d\n\u201cHere.\u201d\u00a0 Laura steps around the bed, grabbing a little button on a wire.\u00a0 \u201cPress this.\u00a0 Gives you morphine.\u201d\u00a0 She presses it into his hand just in time for the door to swing open.\nDerek is dressed in jeans and a T-shirt and a jacket, obviously not going to work, and he\u2019s holding a coffee cup that\u2019s identical to Laura\u2019s.\u00a0 He stands frozen when he sees that Stiles is sitting up.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my cue!\u201d Laura announces, leaning in and kissing Stiles\u2019 forehead.\u00a0 \u201cStay classy, Stilinski.\u201d\u00a0 She grins, leaving him with a wink, and brushes past her brother on the way out.\u00a0 \u201cDerek.\u201d\n\u201cLaura.\u201d\n\u201cMom would have liked him.\u201d\nStiles can see how Derek swallows tightly, his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing.\u00a0 But he nods.\u00a0 \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, \u201cI think so.\u201d\nWhen she\u2019s gone, Stiles struggles up into a more even sitting position, watching as Derek moves to stand by the side of the bed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to do that to me,\u201d Derek says.\u00a0 \u201cEver.\u201d\nStiles arches an eyebrow.\u00a0 \u201cHey, Derek, nice to see you too.\u00a0 How\u2019s your weekend been?\u00a0 I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a far cry from a lavish suite in LA, yeah?\u201d\nDerek sets his coffee cup down after a moment of hesitation, and then he pulls the lone chair in the room closer to the bed, sitting with one arm leaning on the uncomfortable mattress.\u00a0 \u201cWhen I was fifteen, my sister and I and my younger brother Jake were all at school when someone snuck into our house and murdered our parents and our younger sister.\u00a0 Jake went on a bender after that, ended up in rehab over and over and over again.\u00a0 Killed himself six years ago.\u00a0 My uncle Peter wasn\u2019t in the house; he was the only extended family we had left.\u00a0 Until he died right after Jake.\u201d\nStiles closes his eyes.\u00a0 \u201cDerek\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI love you, Stiles.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been in love with you for months\u2014maybe longer\u2014and I\u2019ll be damned if I lose you too.\u00a0 Do you understand?\u201d\u00a0 He grabs Stiles\u2019 hand, twisting their fingers together.\u00a0 \u201cDo you understand?\u201d he repeats.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\u00a0 He stands and shoves at Stiles\u2019 side.\u00a0 \u201cC\u2019mon, move over.\u00a0 I\u2019ve slept like four hours collectively over the last few days.\u201d\nStiles laughs as he scoots over.\u00a0 He makes to roll onto his side but Derek stops him.\u00a0 When Derek settles, his back is to Stiles.\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nDerek grumbles something incoherent.\u00a0 \u201cShut up, Stilinski.\u201d\n\u201cDerek Hale likes to be the little spoon,\u201d Stiles says to himself as he winds an arm around Derek\u2019s waist and nuzzles the back of his neck.\u00a0 \u201cNoted.\u201d\n\u201cAlso this way you don\u2019t have to put pressure on your injured arm.\u201d\nStiles shrugs.\u00a0 \u201cWhatever helps you sleep at night.\u201d\n\u201cStiles.\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cLaura was right.\u00a0 My mom really would\u2019ve liked you.\u201d\nStiles blinks, absorbing that.\u00a0 It seems that that\u2019s the only thing Derek is going to say, so he just settles in, pressing his nose to the back of Derek\u2019s neck.\u00a0 \u201cDerek.\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cI love you too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood morning, Dr. Stilinski,\u201d Erica coos as she walks into the lab, sipping from a cup of coffee.\u00a0 She leans up against the evidence table, picking through the evidence bags. \u201cAnything new?\u201d\n\u201cSince you checked with me last night?\u201d\u00a0 Stiles smirks.\u00a0 \u201cSorry, but no.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s your arm?\u201d\n\u201cMuch better, thanks for asking.\u00a0 Just trying to let it hang.\u00a0 Doctor\u2019s orders.\u201d\u00a0 He pushes off from the computer he\u2019s working at and his wheelie chair takes him to the table where Erica is standing.\u00a0 \u201cAnything I can help you with this morning?\u201d\n\u201cBoss man\u2019s not in yet,\u201d Erica says, and she\u2019s smiling slightly.\u00a0 \u201cI was just wondering if you\u2019d seen him?\u201d\nStiles arches an eyebrow.\u00a0 \u201cSorry, can\u2019t say I have.\u201d\n\u201cUh huh.\u00a0 Well, if you do, let me know.\u201d\u00a0 She waves goodbye as he walks back towards the elevators.\u00a0 As soon as she\u2019s gone, Derek comes stomping out of the back, a pink donut box in his hand.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he says, and drops it on Stiles\u2019 desk.\u00a0 \u201cFound Danny hiding it.\u201d\nStiles grins, reaching for it.\u00a0 \u201cMy knight in shining armor.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cI live to serve,\u201d Derek drawls.\u00a0 He kisses Stiles slowly, smiling against his mouth.\u00a0 When he straightens up, he heads towards the door, walking backwards.\u00a0 \u201cLunch?\u201d\n\u201cSee you then.\u201d\nAnd Stiles leans back, watching Derek walk away.\nHe loves his job.\n\u00a0"
