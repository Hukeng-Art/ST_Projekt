    "text": "\u00a0\n\u201cDude, do they even let you be gay and a firelord?\u201d Sokka asked Zuko in a voice that he hoped sounded a lot more casual than he thought it did. Sokka hadn\u2019t even known Zuko was gay until Katara basically took out a PSA about it. Apparently, a lot had changed the in the years since the war had ended. A lot Sokka hadn't known about, or heard about in the South Pole.\u00a0\nSokka was in the fire nation now, though. With Zuko. The two were sitting on the tiled sun roof, Sokka\u2019s arms crossed ridiculously behind his head.\nIf Zuko was surprised by the question he didn\u2019t show it. \u201cThey don\u2019t even let me be gay, Sokka,\u201d Zuko responded dryly.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sokka asked. He moved his hands from behind his head to sit up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s illegal in the fire nation,\u201d Zuko responded. \u201cI\u2019ve mentioned it before --\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sokka asked again, but louder. He rubbed his unexpectedly sweaty palms on his pants. This wasn\u2019t exactly going to way he thought it would. It was probably because his voice didn\u2019t sound casual enough. Things would have been fine if he voice had been casual enough. Sokka  knew  he should\u2019ve practiced more.\nZuko winced and moved his arms upward in an aborted gesture to shush Sokka. Oh God, Sokka\u2019s voice  definitely one hundred percent hadn't sounded casual enough.\n\u201cI mean,\u201d Sokka lowered his voice. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you -- change it, or something?\u201d\nZuko looked at him like he was insane. \u201cThe Fire Nation just got out of a Hundred Year War -- which we, technically, lost -- and you want me to start passing legislative on people\u2019s -- love lives?\u201d He scoffed.\n\u201cBut you\u2019re gay and if you\u2019re gay ,don\u2019t you want to be gay and you know, do gay things with all that -- gay -- things,\u201d Sokka was aware he was rambling, thank you very much. The problem was, he couldn\u2019t seem to stop, once he\u2019d started. His palms were really, really,  really  sweaty which was weird because this didn\u2019t affect him, like at all and anyway even if it did, it was only because Zuko was his friend and he loved him the normal amount. For friends. Not like how he loved Suki who had, you know, breasts! So there! Sokka wasn\u2019t gay! He shouldn\u2019t even care about this! Sokka was just a really, really,  really  good friend. Who cared. About Zuko. A lot. The normal friend a lot though. Not the gay amount. Because. And Sokka couldn't emphasize this enough. You know. Breasts.\n\u201c... so, I guess that\u2019s the reason why.\u201d Sokka came to his senses to find Zuko looking at him expectantly.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, for what had to be the seven million and fifth time. What had Zuko been saying? It sounded like some classic Zuko bullshit evasion. \u201cIt sounds like a bunch of bullshit,\u201d Sokka told him, trying to pretend that he had been listening as his vulnerable -- no -- sexy looking -- no -- rugged -- no -- honor bound -- there we go -- companion had been pouring his heart out to him.\nTo his surprise, instead of blasting his head off with fire, or at the very least giving him the patient pursed lips of disappointment, Zuko actually nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, shaking his head wonderingly. \u201cIt was all bullshit. Sokka, I swear, sometimes you know me better than I know myself.\u201d\n\u201cYep!\u201d Sokka said. \u201cThat\u2019s me! The \u2026 intuition guy!\u201d\n\u201cI guess the real reason I haven't done anything about the -- well, you know,\u201d Zuko continued, distinctly uncomfortable and fidgeting with his robes, \u201cis that I\u2019m -- worried. How the nation will react. I\u2019m worried my nation will think me weak. And \u2026\u201d he stopped.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Sokka prompted, eagerly.\nZuko looked down at his hands. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve no one I -- no reason to break any laws. Also, a heir is required of me, so I might as well --\u201d\n\u201cYou mean, you don\u2019t like anyone?\u201d Sokka asked, not sure why he felt so disappointed by that.\n\u201cI -- do,\u201d Zuko said. \u201cBut, um. That is to say,\u201d he fumbled around for words for another few minutes before Sokka took pity on him.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like you back? Yeah, we\u2019ve all been there. I mean, not me personally. I\u2019ve liked exactly two girls and they\u2019ve both liked me back, which you know, I\u2019m kind of the greatest, so, that makes sense and --\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Zuko said, a sad twist to his mouth. His eyes were flickering back and forth, across Sokka\u2019s face, as if he was looking for some sort of answer. What kind of answer, Sokka didn\u2019t know. \u201cHe, um, doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know? Have you told him how you feel?\u201d Sokka asked. Then he frowned. \u201cWho is it, anyway?\u201d\nZuko shot backwards so quickly he almost fell off his lawn chair. \u201cWho -- what -- no one,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you because he doesn\u2019t like me so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\u201cHave you told him? Did he reject you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I --\u201d Zuko risked a peak at Sokka from under his fringe. \u201cI know he doesn\u2019t feel the same. It would be \u2026 awkward.\u201d\n\u201cDo I know him?\u201d Sokka asked. He leaned forward eagerly. \u201cPlease tell me who it is! I promise, you can trust me. I'm a great matchmaker!\u201d\n\u201cSokka!\u201d Zuko protested, leaning so much further back that this time, he really did fall off his lawn chair.\nSokka shot closer, draping his body over Zuko's recently involuntarily vacated lawn chair, head in line with Zuko\u2019s chest. Zuko looked tense, holding himself unnaturally still. \u201cBecause if I knew him, I could maybe help set you two up. Get you some action, that sort of thing. Like I was saying before, I\u2019m kind of a stellar matchmaker. A love god, if you will.\u201d\n\u201cI -- love -- what?\u201d Zuko asked, dazed, staring up into Sokka\u2019s eyes. \u00a0\n\u201cMan,\u201d Sokka said, still peering down at Zuko, this time in concern. Was Zuko really having a hard time understanding him? Sokka pulled back suddenly and hopped off the chair, offering Zuko his hand. \u201cYou must\u2019ve hit your head when you fell off that chair.\u201d\n\u201c... right,\u201d Zuko said, staring at Sokka\u2019s hand, face still red. He grabbed Sokka\u2019s hand. His hand felt weirdly warm in Sokka\u2019s grasp, callused and hard.\n\u201cDude, are you alright?\u201d Sokka leaned in to examine Zuko, not letting go of his hand. \u201cMaybe you should --\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go!\u201d Zuko blurted out, edging away from Sokka\u2019s grip.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sokka asked.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a meeting. That I forgot about. That\u2019s happening now. Important business. Firelord stuff. You get it, I'm sure. We\u2019ll talk later,\u201d Zuko said, darting off. Sokka watched him go. That was weird. Even for Zuko.\nSokka looked down at his now empty hand. It was strange, but Sokka kind of missed Zuko\u2019s warmth. He shivered, even though it was bright and sunny out. Weird, he thought again. That must be a Firebender thing. The warmth. Oddly, though, the idea of finding a different, female firebender to hold hands with filled him with nothing but dread. He shook his head. Katara probably wouldn't know what to do but if he was talking to Katara he wasn't stuck alone with his thoughts so check and mate Mr Brain Head!\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey! Katara! Kataraaaa! Kat -- fuck!\u201d Sokka slipped on a particularly unexpected piece of ice and fell. He pouted. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d he pointing out, accusingly.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to run all the way across Zuko's palace screaming my name,\u201d she pointed out in return, pleasantly. \"A palace, I might add, that I am only visiting under duress and because the peace of the nations relies on it.\"\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Sokka waved his hand in the air dismissively. \u201cWhatever. I have something important to tell you!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Katara asked, interested in spite of herself.\nSokka leaned in, conspiratorially. \u201cKatara,\u201d he said, in a low secretive voice. \u201cZuko has a crush.\u201d\nKatara did not look properly surprised. She didn\u2019t even look mildly shocked. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, vaguely interested. \u201cYou finally figured that out?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean finally?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been -- two years, three, almost. Just. You know. Take it easy on him. He\u2019s got low self esteem and everything --\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d Sokka asked, bewildered.\n\u201cIt means don\u2019t be a dick when you --- hang on,\u201d Katara stopped herself, turning around slowly. \u201cWho do you think Zuko has a crush on?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to figure out,\u201d he admitted to Katara.\nKatara stared at him. \u201cYou mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d she asked incredulous. \u201cYou mean it isn\u2019t -- completely obvious?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I -- wait, do you know who it is?\u201d\nKatara gulped. Sokka saw her gulp. She knew! His sister knew who Zuko liked and she was  keeping it from him. Sokka was going to get to the bottom of this, no matter what it took.\n\u201cUm,\u201d Katara said. \u201cI promised Zuko I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone?\u201d\n\u201cThis is so unfair,\u201d Sokka complained. \u201cI\u2019m your brother. Whatever happened to Water Tribe solidarity?\u201d\nKatara rolled her eyes. \u201cWhy do you even care?\u201d\nSokka refused to even think about why he didn\u2019t want to answer that. \u201cJust tell me who he likes, Katara,\u201d he begged, instead.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Katara insisted. \u201cI\u2019m not going to betray Zuko\u2019s trust like that.\u201d\n\u201cKatara,\u201d Sokka explained slowly. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know who Zuko likes, I can\u2019t create a elaborate scheme to hook them up.\u201d\nKatara took a moment to absorb that, to really take it in. That was okay. Sometimes it took genius a while to be recognized. Sokka could wait. He could -- was his sister giggling? Was she  laughing? \n\u201cYou want --\u201d Katara\u2019s voice was muffled with suppressed laughter. \u201cYou want to set Zuko up? With the guy he has a crush on?\u201d\nSokka frowned. He couldn\u2019t believe Katara would betray him like this. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you! This is a serious matter!\u201d He didn\u2019t even know why it was funny. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why it\u2019s funny!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d Katara told him, briefly bringing her laughter under control. \u201cIt\u2019s  hysterical.\u201d \n\u201cKatara!\u201d Sokka whined.\nShe just shook her head, rocking back and forth, shoulders shaking with quiet laughter.\n\u201cFine! I\u2019ll do it myself!\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m going to be the best wingman that Zuko ever had, okay? I\u2019m not going to rest until I find the man of Zuko\u2019s heart and the two of them fall in love and live happily ever after forever and ever until they both die! Of old age! At the same time! Leaving the Fire Nation in the capable hands of their probably adopted son -- or daughter,\u201d he added hastily, not that Katara was in any sort of shape to be berating him or even forming words.\n\u201cYou absolute idiot,\u201d was the last thing he heard his sister choke out as he retreated to his room to plan.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSokka started by making a list. He was sure that he would make many more, different better list, but for now he started with a list of every man Zuko had ever met. He put Aang on it at first for the sake of thoroughness, then frowned, shook his head and took Aang off of it.\nZuko was actually kind of a hunk, now that Sokka thought about it, scar included, so this whole list thing might not actually be as hard as he originally thought. Not that Sokka noticed how Zuko looked, or how other men looked, because Sokka didn\u2019t. Sokka went at the list for a good thirty minutes, stopped and read it over.\u00a0There really weren\u2019t many names on it to begin with but when he started crossing people that Zuko had tried to kill in the last few years, he wasn\u2019t left with a single name.\nDid Zuko really have no male friends around the same age as him that he hadn\u2019t tried to kill at some point in the two or three years? Not according to this list. Besides Haru, Sokka couldn\u2019t think of a single person outside the Gaang that Zuko had even known a year ago, but if Zuko liked Haru, Sokka would have to re-evaluate his entire opinion of the Fire Lord\u2019s judgement.\nMaybe Sokka should be focusing on finding Zuko new men? Yeah, that was a great idea! Zuko did say his current slice of homemade love pie wasn't giving him back any crust after all. Maybe Zuko just needed a new, laid back, funny, inventive, restless kind of guy -- to balance out all that Zuko-ness. Someone fun. Someone --\u00a0\nSokka gobbled up the old list and threw it away. It was time for a new list. A list of  ideas.  Ideas about how to introduce Zuko to  men.  New  men. Ideas that Sokka wrote down instead of responding to or engaging with his own thoughts.\u00a0\nThis was going to work. He was a genius!\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Idea #1: hot guards are hot \n\n\u201cHey!\u201d Sokka greeted Zuko completely normally and non-suspiciously at the breakfast table. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cSokka!\u201d In his haste to stand up and great Sokka, Zuko accidentally upended his goblet of juice onto his official black robe. \u201cFuck,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d\nThe royal chef who brought out his breakfast immediately started to try and clean up Zuko\u2019s robe, but Zuko pushed his hands away.\nSokka gave the servant a crucial look over. She was a woman, which the first strike, and she was also about seventy-two years old which was a second strike. He should probably not add her to the \u2018potential Zuko setups\u2019 list. Sokka gave a decisive nod.\n\u201cYou can go,\u201d he told the royal chef. It wasn\u2019t nearly as effectively as he imagined it would be in his head.\nFor one, Zuko looked up at him in shock and for two, the royal chef put her hands on her hips and refused to move.\n\u201cI mean, if you want to,\u201d Sokka corrected immediately, lifting his hands up in the air.\nThe royal chef put down her napkin and left slowly, maintaining eye contact with Sokka as she left.\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Zuko groaned the second she was out of earshot. \u201cNow she hates me. Do you know how long it took for her to stop sneaking extra fire flakes into my desert?\u201d\n\u201cHey now,\u201d Sokka said. \u201cNone of that negative talk! Look on the bright side -- at least you\u2019re  good  at being hated!\u201d\n\u201cSokka,\u201d Zuko said through clenched teeth. \u201cThat isn\u2019t actually helpful.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, it is,\u201d Sokka insisted. \u201cYou have a lot of experience being hated. That\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re  about to get a lot of experience being hated,\u201d Zuko mumbled under his breath.\nSokka wisely chose to ignore this. \u201cBeing hated is just what happens when you\u2019re evil. Which is why you should never ever be evil again. It's a good life lesson. You can never learn too many times to not be evil.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Sokka,\u201d Zuko said. \u201cWhere would I be without your invaluable advice?\u201d\nSokka shrugged. \u201cProbably off somewhere being evil and hated,\u201d to which Zuko actually laughed.\nSokka grinned, taking that as encouragement. He threw his arm around Zuko\u2019s broad and apparently  very built shoulder and tried to think good thoughts about how amazingly this was going to work.\n\u201cZuko,\u201d Sokka whispered in his ear, \u201clet\u2019s go outside.\u201d Zuko shivered, which Sokka thought was weird. He pulled back. \u201cDo you need a cloak or something? Are you cold?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Zuko said shortly, avoiding Sokka\u2019s eyes again. \u201cLet\u2019s just go.\u201d\nThe two of them left for the palace gardens, Sokka following Zuko. Sure enough, exactly like Sokka had planned and anticipated, Zuko took the two of them to the edge of the turtleduck pond. Sometimes, Sokka wondered if Zuko had ever been to any other part of the garden. Like, had he ever smelled the flowers? Or gone over to the planting beds? Or the trees? Jumped over rocks? Wiggled in the vaguely lagoon shaped algae pits? Or literally anywhere else? Sokka doubted it because, when all was said and done, Zuko was an absolute dumbass. \u00a0\nZuko took a seat by the edge of the pond, face twisted up in concentration.\n\u201cI have a meeting later,\u201d he told Sokka brusquely. Sokka would've been offended if he didn't know by know that brusque for Zuko was extraordinary hospitality for anyone else.\u00a0\n\u201cZuko, relax,\u201d Sokka told him, eyes casting around for the guard shift. They were a little early, but Sokka had faith that his meddling would pull through.\n\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Zuko\u2019s body tensed up. \u201cIs there going to be an attack?\u201d\n\u201cZuko,\u201d Sokka repeated, \u201cRelax. You need to loosen up.\u201d He raked his eyes over Zuko\u2019s frame: formal dress, hair pulled into the traditional top knot. \u201cHere,\u201d he reached for Zuko\u2019s top knot, fingers brushing against Zuko\u2019s smooth, black hair.\nZuko sat perfectly, unflinchingly, shockingly still as Sokka carefully started to pull his headpiece out.\nWhen Sokka finally got the headpiece pinning Zuko\u2019s hair out, his breath caught for a moment. Zuko\u2019s hair was longer than it had been at the Western Air Temple and the cut was much less jagged.\nIt was so long that it fell down to his chin, completely obscuring the scar on face. It wasn\u2019t right. He didn\u2019t look like Zuko. He was a fragment of Zuko-that-was when Sokka was used to the totality of Zuko-that-is. Sokka\u2019s hands trembled, seemingly with an invisible weight, as he put his thumbs on the bottom of Zuko\u2019s cheeks and brushed his hair behind his ears.\nZuko\u2019s skin burned beneath Sokka\u2019s palms and when Zuko spoke, his voice was dry and cracked and he had to lick his lips. \u201cWhat -- are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t see your scar,\u201d Sokka found himself unable to answer any other way that honestly, fingers still curled around Zuko\u2019s jaw. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look like you.\u201d\nZuko looked away, pulling his face out of Sokka\u2019s hands. \u201cYou should\u2019ve let it stay hidden,\u201d he told Sokka.\nSokka was shaking his head before Zuko even finished. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. He reached out, not sure what he wanted to do or even what he wanted to say, but knowing he needed to say something, to impress on Zuko why he shouldn\u2019t ever be ashamed of his own face.\nHis gesture fell short. He let his hand fall restless against the grass.\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of you,\u201d Sokka said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t ever try to get rid of part of you.\u201d Katara, he knew, could come up with something better, something comforting and nice. Aang probably could too. Sokka felt useless, until he felt Zuko shifting to face him.\nThis time, Sokka could see the dull red against his pale skin. Zuko\u2019s lips were shadowed at this angle, tilted upward in a small smile. It was Sokka's turn to feel frozen, caught and stripped under Zuko's high beams.\nThen Zuko spoke and whatever spell had held him there was broken. \u201cNot even the evil part?\u201d Zuko asked, teasingly.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Sokka said, brain not entirely back on online yet. \u00a0\nZuko\u2019s skin darkened slightly. \u201cYou should I shouldn\u2019t try to get rid of any part of myself. And I was -- you said -- I was just -- joking,\u201d he finished lamely.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you should leave the jokes to me, buddy,\u201d Sokka told him. He went to clap his arm on Zuko\u2019s back, but stopped himself at the last minute. Despite Katara's claims otherwise, Sokka did possess the smallest amount of emotional literacy and was capable of realizing that this was simply not the moment for manly chest slapping. Sokka gave a  good manly chest slap though. Zuko was really missing out.\nMaybe Sokka should --\n\u201cSokka,\u201d Zuko said, nervously, hands fisting the loose fabric of his formal robes, \u201cI have something to -- I need to tell you.\u201d\nSokka turned to face him, but as he was turning his head he noticed something out of the corner of his eye. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asked, still kind of glancing around.\n\u201cI, um, kind of have, um -- that is to say, I like --\u201d\nThat\u2019s when Sokka\u2019s eyes landed on Jee, the most recent and youngest addition to the Palace Guard. He was right on time. \u201cJee!\u201d Sokka shouted, interrupting Zuko and waving his hands above his head. Sokka instantly regretted it, mentally slapping himself in the head. Maybe originally, it was supposed to be a set up for Zuko but now Sokka wanted Jee to leave. He wanted it to just be him and Zuko and he wanted to know what Zuko was going to say say, but --\nJee started coming over, because  of course  Jee was coming over -- because Sokka  called  Jee over!\nSokka tried to make the universal sign for Stop Right Now, I\u2019m an Idiot but apparently Jee knew that was as Don\u2019t Stop Ever In Fact Speed Up I\u2019m In Danger Because I\u2019m an Idiot because Jee started sprinting over. Sokka sighed. He probably deserved that. \u00a0\n\u201cSokka Water Tribe.\u201d Jee bowed low. \u201cFire Lord Zuko.\u201d He bowed again. Zuko bowed back on instinct, looking mystified and a little disappointed.\n\u201cJee, stop that,\u201d Sokka hissed and Jee straightened up.\n\u201cYes, Sokka Water Tribe.\u201d\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t call me that! We\u2019ve been over this!\u201d\nThey had. Sokka had met with Jee twenty minutes before creeping down to bother Zuko at breakfast and Sokka had given Jee strict instructions. They had involved not coming over until he got Sokka\u2019s signal, not calling Zuko \u2018Fire Lord\u2019 and addressing Sokka as Lord Sokka. So far, none of these rules had been followed.\n\u201cSorry, Sokka W -- Lord Sokka,\u201d Jee corrected.\nSokka nodded once in approval. For one horrible, horrible moment Sokka thought about telling Jee to just leave and insisting that Zuko explain himself. But Sokka had made a plan. He was going to stick to the plan and, eventually, the plan was going to make Zuko very happy. Plans were good. Sokka's plans were good. They were even going to work out, one of these days. Sokka was sure. Who cared if he wanted to stay and talk to Zuko alone - this wasn't about him! This was about Zuko. Who needed to meet men and get over his sad secret crush.\n\u201cZuko,\u201d Sokka said, very reluctantly. \u201cThis is Jee. Jee, Zuko.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Zuko told Sokka, in a questioning tone. \u201cI hired him?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Fire Lord Zuko,\u201d Jee affirmed. And then, after a violent pantomime by Sokka, \u201cI mean, Zuko.\u201d Even as he was saying it, though, he was wincing.\nSokka looked between the two of them rapidly. Well, there was no way in hell this wasn\u2019t going to be a complete success. \u201cOh no,\u201d Sokka lied unconvincingly. \u201cI\u2019ve just remembered that I have to go somewhere else right now leaving you two alone to talk for hours. How horrible!\u201d\n\u201cSokka, don\u2019t you dare leave,\u201d Zuko started.\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Sokka said.\n\u201cSokka, come back here. Don\u2019t walk away! Sokka!\u201d\n\u201cSorry, can\u2019t hear you!\u201d\n\u201cYou asshole!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know, I\u2019m amazing! You don't have to say it all the time Zuko, jeez.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know, I wish I could stay too!\u201d And then Sokka was completely out of earshot.\nPerfect, he thought to himself. He really was an absolute genius. But if he was such a genius, why did his stomach hurt? Sokka shrugged mentally. He was probably just nervous it wasn\u2019t going to work out. Which it was. Which would be a  good  thing. Yeah. That made sense. It was going to work, he told the sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. It was going to work.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt didn\u2019t work out.\nZuko came up to Sokka maybe ten minutes after Sokka left him and Jee by the pond, ranting and yelling about how this was an abuse of power and how Jee was a guard and that Sokka was never to do anything else like this ever again did he understand?\nSokka tuned Zuko out about a minute and a half into his rant.\nFor some reason, instead of upsetting him or bothering him, it just buoyed Sokka, his stomach ache completely gone. It just went to show that some people more well adjusted than others, Sokka thought to himself. Some people could take failure to turn it into\u00a0success. Besides. There were still ideas #2-#17.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nidea #2: improving Zuko\u2019s self esteem so he finally can admit his big gay feelings.\nSokka started another list. It was his third list in as many days and no, he didn\u2019t think that was a bad sign, thanks for asking.\nHe started this third and hopefully final list the best way he knew how: by dividing the page in half vertically. The first half was reasons not to date Zuko. The other half was reasons to date Zuko. This was going to work, Sokka told himself, again. He was just going to read this list out loud to Zuko and then Zuko would go out into the world and make wild, wild love with any and all available men.\nWhen he was done writing his pro and con list for dating Zuko, he showed it to Katara who just rolled her eyes and told him he was perhaps the stupidest boy to ever exist, like for real the actual stupidest, like even Ozai wasn\u2019t as stupid as Sokka and Ozai tried to literally burn the entire world. Personally, Sokka thought was so rude of her to say when Jet like, existed.\nBut he guessed that the list must have been pretty good because Katara didn\u2019t tell him not to do it.\nThe next day, Sokka found Zuko in the throne room, pacing the floor, with his hand in the air, reciting something to himself. \u201cThe stone that turns itself over is \u2026 the new side of the same stone?\u201d\nSokka shook his head. He wasn\u2019t going to ask. Zuko was a weird guy. Sometimes he paced around saying nonsense to himself in an empty throne room in a weird riddles or in a screechy high pitched voice. It was bizarre and frankly a little concerning. But he\u2019d had a rough go of it so Sokka cut him some slack.\n\u201cHey, crazy pants,\u201d Sokka said. Okay, maybe Sokka didn\u2019t cut him that much slack. But it was so much fun to see the war of joy and embarrassment that crossed Zuko\u2019s face whenever Sokka teased him that Sokka didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever be able to stop.\n\u201cOkay, so I\u2019ve been thinking more about your love life problems --\u201d\nZuko moaned. \u201cPlease, Sokka --\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve made a pro or con list about why this mystery guy that you won\u2019t tell me about for some fake reason should date you.\u201d\n\u201cYou did -- you made --\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sokka nodded sagely. \u201cIt\u2019s because you have low self-esteem, which are two words Katara taught me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill Katara,\u201d Zuko said.\n\u201cI realized that you haven\u2019t asked out this guy because you\u2019re afraid of rejection. Because of your low self esteem.\u201d\n\u201cMy life was so much easier when you were all scared of me,\u201d Zuko told him.\n\u201cSo I made a list,\u201d Sokka ignored him. \u201cOf reasons why any gay man in his right mind might want to date you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly --\u201d Zuko told him in a strangled voice.\n\u201cSit down and shut up,\u201d Sokka told him, pointing at the throne.\nZuko sat down and shut up.\n\u201cNumber one,\u201d Sokka read loudly. \u201cYour hair is the exact right length. It\u2019s fluffy and silky and you could really have some fun times running your hands through it.\u201d Sokka flushed when he realized what that sounded like. \u201cNot that I want to run my hands through it,\u201d he said. Zuko looked away. \u201cI meant some sort of hypothetical person might, hypothetically want to run their hypothetical hands through it.\u201d\n\u201cSokka, I get it,\u201d Zuko attempted to cut him off but Sokka would not be cut off.\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m not gay.\u201d Sokka hesitated. Zuko still wouldn\u2019t make eye contact with him. \u201cNot that being gay is a bad thing,\u201d Sokka added hastily. It didn\u2019t seem to help.\n\u201cSokka, -- you don\u2019t have to -- remind me,\u201d Zuko told the floor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that. You know. Boobs,\u201d Sokka explained helpfully. Zuko didn\u2019t reply. Then Sokka tilted his head to the side. \u201cI guess you don\u2019t actually know,\u201d he said.\n\u201cUm, no,\u201d Zuko said. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re nice,\u201d Sokka told him, forgetting all about the list for a minute. \u201cReally nice.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Zuko snapped, in a voice that was cold and angry all of the sudden, which Sokka didn\u2019t get at all! They were having a great and totally non-awkward conversation about one of Sokka\u2019s favorite things: breasts! \u201cSokka, are you done wasting my time today, or did you have something else to say?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Sokka said, gesturing at the scroll. \u201cNo need to be a sour catsnake. I still have ninety-nine reasons to go.\u201d\nZuko dropped his head into his hands and bit his lip. \u201cLook, I --\u201d he started.\n\u201cReason number two,\u201d Sokka read, determinedly. \u201cZuko is ripped.\u201d\nZuko closed his eyes. \u201cPlease tell me that\u2019s not an actual reason,\u201d he told Sokka.\n\u201cReason number three,\u201d Sokka continued. \u201cHe\u2019s the Fire Lord. Which is just like an instant status bump. And, who knows, some people get off on that sort of thing! I mean, sometimes Suki would --\u201d\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Zuko yelled. \u201cSokka, I don\u2019t want to hear this!\u201d\nOkay, Zuko was bring out his Mr Angry voice, which meant that if Sokka preferred his eyebrows to remain unsigned, he should shut up now. Unfortunately, Sokka\u2019s brain often worked faster than his mouth which meant -- \u201cI\u2019m just saying, the Fire Lord thing can be kind of a turn on for some people!\u201d\nInstead of shooting a fireball at Sokka\u2019s head like Sokka expected, the ends of Zuko\u2019s mouth just turned down in a sad little frown that just a little bit sadder and more frown-y than his typical sad and frown-y Zuko expression. \u201cYeah, some people. Not everyone.\u201d\nSokka didn\u2019t really know what to make of that. \u201cZuko, bud, this is exactly what I\u2019m talking about. You gotta get that self esteem up. I\u2019m sure your mysterious man --\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a mysterious man!\u201d Zuko growled. \u201cAnd if I did, you could probably go so far as to say that I\u2019ve recently become one hundred percent aware that he isn\u2019t into that,\u201d Zuko did something with his hands that was clearly supposed to imply some sort of sexual act, though Sokka didn't think that gay sex normally had to be that aggressively chaotic or seemingly anatomically impossible, \u201csort of thing.\u201d He finished with the sort of gesture Sokka didn't think he'd ever be able to unsee.\n\u201cOkay, fine, you don\u2019t have a mysterious man slash we're dropping the mysterious man. See, this is me. Dropping it. You don't have a mysterious man.\u201d Sokka conceded this point, temporarily, but rallied quickly. \u201cYet! Because you haven't had me on the case!\u201d\n\u201cSokka! I -- don\u2019t -- I won\u2019t --\u201d Zuko spluttered.\n\u201cAnd I swear right here that I will find a way to get you together with someone, preferably this  future  mysterious man, okay, or I\u2019ll die trying.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to die, then,\u201d Zuko told him.\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Sokka said. \u201cNone of that! We are embracing optimism! We are embracing the optimistic spirit! Just like I did in ... Ba \u2026 Sing Se --\u201d\n\u201cAnd how did that turn out?\u201d Zuko snorted.\n\u201cWell! At first it turned out well!\u201d Sokka protested, arms flailing around. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect your sister to, you know, show up and invade the whole entire place --\u201d\n\u201cSo you call the fall of the greatest Earth Kingdom stronghold something that went well?\u201d Zuko asked sarcastically.\n\u201cSort of?\u201d Sokka replied, refusing to back down.\n\u201cSort of! Sokka, your level of -- delusion about your \u201csuccess\u201d in the Earth Kingdom --\u201d\nSokka didn\u2019t let him finish. \u201cWe got Appa back!\u201d\n\u201cI got you Appa back, you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, like I said,  we got Appa back.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Zuko replied. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I was the one who did that because, you know, I was there and I remember doing it. And considering I fell ill and almost died directly as a result of that rescue, I\u2019m damned well not going to let you get away with taking credit for it!\u201d\n\u201cZuko,\u201d Sokka said, patiently waiting for Zuko to tire himself out. \u201cYou\u2019re part of Team Avatar.\u201d\n\u201cI --\u201d this froze Zuko in his tracks. \u201cI wasn\u2019t then,\u201d he finished.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sokka reflected. \u201cBut you did set Appa free then, didn\u2019t you? And that was kind of good?\u201d\nZuko\u2019s mouth made a little noise, but Sokka could tell that Zuko wasn\u2019t going to be able to answer him tonight. Zuko looked down. \u201cI have sparring with Jee soon,\u201d he said, in lieu of responding.\nSokka almost choked on the air. \u201cJee?\u201d he hacked out.\nZuko raised his only eyebrow. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Sokka said, waving his arms around like a crazy person, \u201cWhat about all that dumb Zuko stuff about honor and positions of power or whatever you were saying before I tuned you out completely?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re just sparring, Sokka,\u201d Zuko told him, flatly.\n\u201cYou say that now,\u201d Sokka told him. \u201cBut before you know it he\u2019s going to be -- engaging you in sexual congress!\u201d\nZuko stared at him. \u201cSokka,\u201d he asked, pained, \u201cwhy do you insist on saying these things?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just looking out for you!\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Zuko allowed, \u201cbut could you look out for me in a way that doesn\u2019t involve the words sexual congress?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sokka told him immediately and Zuko pinched the bridge of his nose.\nHe peered at Sokka through one eye. \u201cWhat are you even trying to argue? Isn\u2019t,\u201d Zuko tried to pretend like he wasn\u2019t blushing, \u201c'sexual congress' kind of what you want?\u201d\nSokka opened his mouth to protest but -- he closed it again. Zuko was right. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said.\nZuko was flabbergasted. \u201cNo -- I -- what -- I\u2019m right?\u201d\nSokka snorted. \u201cYou know you\u2019re allowed to be happy, right?\u201d Sokka told him, half kidding, half serious.\n\u201cHa ha,\u201d Zuko dead panned. \u201cYou\u2019re very funny.\u201d\n\u201cYou even deserve a hot man. A sexy, sexy Fire Nation man. Even if it\u2019s Jee! Someone to keep you warm on the -- well, not at all ever even slightly cold nights but still --\u201d\n\u201cSokka,\u201d Zuko groaned, covering his face with his hands.\n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Sokka held his hands up in surrender. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone to brood. Or spar. Or \u2018spar\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cStop that,\u201d Zuko told him. \u201cWe\u2019re just sparing. That\u2019s it. And,\u201d he added, a little petulantly, \u201cI don\u2019t brood.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cYou brood,\u201d Sokka said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Zuko protested, but more weakly this time.\n\u201cZuko,\u201d Sokka asked, very seriously. \u201cApproximately how many times a day do I find you sitting in a darkened corner by yourself and looking mournfully out at the window?\u201d\nZuko was suspiciously silent. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to sound like my Uncle,\u201d he told Sokka. \u201cHe was always saying a lot of nonsense too.\u201d But the obviously affection in his voice took out any sting the his words might have had.\nSokka put his hand on his chest. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cI have it on good authority that your Uncle is a very wise man. Namely, yours. You say that your uncle is a very wise man on a daily basis.\u201d\nZuko snorted. \u201cHe\u2019d like to believe that.\u201d\n\u201cSo by extension,\u201d Sokka continued over Zuko, \u201cI am a very wise man.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Zuko said, smiling. \u201cBy extension you\u2019re both idiots.\u201d\nSokka laughed.\nIt wasn\u2019t until he got back to his room, several hours later, that Sokka realized how effectively Zuko had distracted him from his list. He'd only got two reasons down! It'd taken him almost as a minute to come up with the whole list!\u00a0\nWell. Sokka thought. That was okay. That just meant war. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Idea #3: setting the goddamn fool up on a goddamn date \n\nSokka was going to set Zuko up on another surprise date. It was going to go better than the introduction with Jee, though. (Sokka shoved down the little voice inside him that seemed to be saying things were going okay with Jee after all).\u00a0 The date would be with a noble this time. The the duck pond set up -- if it could even be called that -- with had failed so miserably, Sokk was wary of attempting the same thing again. But then, his plan for getting Zuko to make a move had backfired so spectacularly that other nobles and surprise setups were all he had left.\nBesides, he vetted this guy.\nWell. Sort of. He'd had other things to do. The Fire Nation guards were making the travel balloons wrong.\u00a0 Technically they were the same design that yes, Sokka himself had come up with, but that was then-Sokka and this was now-Sokka and now-Sokka could see that they were clearly wrong and could be better, only it took the better part of the afternoon to convince the guards of that and by the time he was done he'd forgotten about the vetting until he was in the middle of dinner -- with Zuko.\u00a0\nAt which point Sokka resigned himself to just not sleeping. Proper vetting or sneaky-nighttime vetting in between fixing the new travel balloons because he'd come up with an even\u00a0better\u00a0idea, this had to go perfectly for Zuko.\u00a0\nSokka had very high hopes for this date. The kid was cool, for a Fire Nation brat, and Sokka had been prepping Zuko by dropping little compliments about his clothing ever breakfast for the last week. He'd never seen a grown man choke as much, but Zuko swore it was just because the head chef had started putting fire flakes in his breakfast again, thanks-a-bunch-Sokka and Sokka dropped it after that. So Zuko was ready to be romanced, and he had a man ready to romance him -- the date was going to go great.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe date did not go well. It started terribly and then somehow only went downhill from there.\u00a0\nThe date started with Zuko showing up to what Zuko thought would be a private picnic with Sokka and ended with an angry seventeen year old son of a rich and important family throwing a soggy towel in Sokka\u2019s face and yelling that if the Fire Lord really wanted to fuck the Fire Nation that badly he could go ahead and do it!\nIt took Sokka one horrified moment to realize the towel only had wine on it and not anything else, and another minute to find Zuko sitting alone, wine dripping down his face and hair.\n\u201cHe dumped on wine glass! On my head!\u201d Zuko yelled, when Sokka showed up.\n\u201cTo be fair, apparently you tried to fuck the Fire Nation?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Zuko replied, still yelling, \u201cI just said I\u2019d never love him more than the Fire Nation and if he\u2019s expected to be involved with me, he should just get used to that!\u201d\nSokka snorted. \u201cTui and La, tell me you didn\u2019t actually say that.\u201d\nZuko looked much more ashamed now. \u201cI did.\u201d He looked up at Sokka. \u201cAnd then he threw the wine glass at me.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019d the towel come from?\u201d Sokka asked.\n\u201cHe threw that at me when I told him Azula had better aim when was nine.\u201d Then, petulantly, arms crossed over his chest, he added: \"Well, it's true.\"\n\u201cAh,\u201d Sokka said. \u201cStill probably better if you don't say that next time. But why was the towel wet?\u201d\n\u201cHe dumped the other bottle of wine on me.\u201d\n\u201cAgain?\u201d\n\u201cOne before the towel, one after,\u201d Zuko confirmed.\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you say that time?\u201d Sokka asked.\n\u201cThat was when I told him I\u2019d rather fuck the Fire Nation than ever even touch him,\u201d Zuko said.\n\u201cI gotta say,\u201d Sokka admitted, \u201cI\u2019m feeling more and more sorry for this guy.\u201d\nZuko  glared  at him.\n\u201cSorry, your Lord Fireness, but I really think his action were warranted. Those are just not very flattering things, dude.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me dude,\u201d Zuko sighed. \u201cAnd. I guess you\u2019re right, but. It is true, what I said at first. There are -- few, very few people -- I would put before the Fire Nation.\u201d\nSokka nodded understandingly. \u201cLike your mom,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Zuko replied, gaze level and piercing. \u201cLike you. Your sister. Your family. Aang. Toph. You know. You guys.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d put us before the Fire Nation?\u201d Sokka asked, completely taken aback.\n\u201cWithout you,\u201d Zuko said, \u201cthere would be no Fire Nation.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Sokka asked.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t even be a question,\u201d Zuko told him.\nSokka didn\u2019t usually find himself at a loss for words. \u201cI -- thank you,\u201d he said, which seemed deeply inappropriate and indeed, made the ends of Zuko\u2019s lips twitch.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, will you please stop setting me up on terrible dates with terrible noble men?\u201d\n\u201cNever,\u201d Sokka told him cheerfully. \u201cBy the way --\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Zuko rolled his eyes. \u201cThe meat is still in the picnic basket. Uneaten.\u201d\n\u201cHell yeah it is!\u201d Sokka jumped up and down. Zuko just shook his head fondly.\n\u201cCome on, asshole,\u201d he told Sokka, fondly leading him back to the abandoned picnic. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a picnic to finish.\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Sokka said when they got there, \u201cthis is a really beautiful view. I picked out a great spot. I\u2019m kind of brilliant.\u201d He took a massive bite of baturky leg. \u201cMghsk kfjghskg slkagj,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Zuko asked.\nSokka swallowed. \u201cI said, this is really romantic.\u201d\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Zuko told him, fiddling with the edge of his robes.\n\u201cI mean, look at the view,\u201d Sokka pointed out to his friend, enthused.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Zuko told him.\nSokka rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s much better than good, you idiot. It\u2019s a beautiful, majestic -- feast.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you\u2019d compare it to food,\u201d Zuko said.\n\u201cTo a lot of food,\u201d Sokka corrected.\nZuko smiled, and nudged Sokka with his shoulder. It sent a wave of warmth curling down Sokka\u2019s arms and settling into his stomach. He leaned back against Zuko and relaxed. It really was beautiful up here, he thought, turning to look at Zuko, with the sun setting behind them.\nHe sat there, chin resting of Zuko\u2019s shoulder, and watching the the sky change from yellow and red to blues and purples, feeling Zuko\u2019s breaths deep within his bones. The air around them was still, and warm. It lulled Sokka into a soft, sleeping sense of calm. He timed his breaths with Zuko's and was, momentarily, still.\nIt should\u2019ve been uncomfortable, leaning on Zuko like this, but Sokka didn\u2019t notice anything past the moment, anything outside the bubble they seemed to be inhabiting.\nToo soon, the sky fell completely dark, and the two of them wordlessly packed up the picnic together and returned to the Palace.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSokka kept with the set up idea for a while. A really, really long while. Probably too long a while, if he was being entirely honest with himself.\nHe abandoned Zuko at a cafe with a Earth Kingdom friend of Haru\u2019s. \u201cToo angry,\u201d Zuko said, which Sokka didn\u2019t even want to touch with a ten foot long pole.\nHe convinced Zuko to go swimming with a Fire Nation family. \u201cToo stiff,\u201d was Zuko\u2019s complaint for these guys.\nHe set Zuko up with another guard. Sokka thought he might\u2019ve changed his mind about that every since he started sparing with Jee. Still: \u201cMy literal employee, Sokka, we\u2019ve been over this!\u201d\nHe invited the gay son of a Water Tribe National. \u201cHe likes polardogs,\u201d was Zuko\u2019s protest. Sokka could barely resist pointing out that Zuko liked polardogs. He would've, too, but something deep inside him didn\u2019t want Zuko to like Natuck. \u00a0\nHe took Zuko to the market and physically shoved him into every man he saw. That was probably Zuko\u2019s least favorite of these attempts because by the third trip to the market, his shoulder was starting to get bruised and also bodily slamming into someone and knocking them to the ground was turning out to  not  be the most effective way of connecting with someone romantically.\nAfter several weeks of this, Zuko starting taking to ducking into whatever room was nearest whenever Sokka approached. Katara took to rolling her eyes whenever she saw him.\nAang occasionally gave Sokka bad suggestions for men Sokka could set Zuko up with.\nToph came with them sometimes and laughed whenever her feet felt Zuko looking embarrassed. \"How --\" Sokka had started but Toph had just cackled and said, \"believe me, even without my feet, it would be obvious.\"\nOnce, memorably, Sokka forced Zuko to go outside for a walk with him and tried to introduce him to every single man along the way.\nHe was just introducing Zuko to a man named \u201cChan\u201d from a \u201cVery important Fire Nation family\u201d which was apparently Fire Nation speak for having legs like a tree trunk,  god damn,  and okay, so Sokka was a little occupied scoping this new man out -- for Zuko, obviously -- that he didn\u2019t notice the three year old child falling off the back of a cabbage cart.\nZuko, however, did see the baby and like many a gazelle-giraffe before him, leapt through the air into a death defying feat of child catching.\nThe driver of the cabbage cart was a very tall young man with short cropped hair and when he got out to thank Zuko, Zuko blushed and stuttered his way through a nearly incoherent response.\nThis wouldn't do, Sokka thought in dismay, watching Zuko and the man talk. Zuko was blushing and seemed nervous and the man seemed nice and explained that he was just watching after the cart for his grandfather.\nAnd then Sokka saw Zuko touch his cheek, which definitely meant Zuko was interested, and that was the final straw.\nSokka stepped aggressively into the vendor\u2019s space and grabbed Zuko\u2019s hand. \u201cSorry, we\u2019ve got to go.\u201d\nZuko just sort of grinned at Sokka, letting himself be pulled away. \u201cSorry,\u201d he called back guilelessly at the young man, waving. The young man waved back. Sokka purposefully didn\u2019t question why Zuko was coming with him so easily. He also didn\u2019t think about why he was pulling Zuko away.\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d Sokka told Zuko for almost no other reason than he wanted to.\n\u201cWhy are we leaving?\u201d Zuko asked curiously. \u201cHe was -- nice. And. You know.\u201d\n\u201cHa!\u201d Sokka yelled in an entirely too forced voice. \u201cIt\u2019s cute you think you like him, but Zuko, you don\u2019t know that man at all! He could\u2019ve been a murderer. He could\u2019ve been a spy. He probably wanted to -- take advantage of your nubile young body!\u201d\n\u201cMy nubile -- my body is not nubile!\u201d\n\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Sokka argued.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s -- I\u2019m not getting into an argument about this,\u201d Zuko insisted. \u201cAnd anyway, Isn\u2019t the point of this to introduce me to strange, um, men?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sokka said in exaggerated voice. \u201cBut men who have been chosen and vetted by  me .\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he was fine,\u201d Zuko protested. \u201cI mean, he had that kid --\u201d\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Sokka interrupted triumphantly. \u201cAre you ready to be a father, Zuko?\u201d\nZuko couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter anymore.\n\u201cZuko are you -- this isn\u2019t a joke, Zuko! Teenage pregnancy is a serious problem!\u201d Somehow that only made Zuko laugh harder. \u201cIt is serious! Do you want a kid right now? Do you seriously think you\u2019re ready for that responsibility? What kind of life do you think they could have?\u201d\nSokka was so caught up in making his point, he didn\u2019t even notice when Zuko\u2019s laughter trailed off into something more awkward.\n\u201cI know I wouldn\u2019t -- I know I can\u2019t have kids, Sokka,\u201d Zuko told him and Sokka felt a swooping sensation in his stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s just nice. To think about.\u201d\nWow. Sokka was really the worst person in the world. Just awful.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d Zuko\u2019s voice sounded like he was -- crying? God, Sokka should just amputate his mouth. \u201cKnowing that my own friend has so little faith in me --\u201d Zuko broke off. Apparently he couldn\u2019t even continue.\nSokka deserved to be punched in the face. Zuko\u2019s shoulders shaking so hard he must be really -- hang on -- \u201cFuck you!\u201d Sokka said, punching the the lying bastard in the arm. \u201cYou asshole! You lying bastard! I thought you were actually upset!\u201d\nZuko just kept snickering.\nSokka shook his head. \u201cNot that you deserve it now,\u201d he said, once Zuko\u2019s laughter had subsided, \u201cbut I was going to say I think you\u2019d make a great father.\u201d\nZuko took a second to answer. \u201cThanks, Sokka,\u201d he told him quietly, with a small private smile.\nSokka beamed at Zuko in return.\nWhen they got back, Zuko left Sokka to go practice firebending with Jee. Like he'd been doing for the last two or three weeks. It was fine. It didn\u2019t bother Sokka. Sokka was used to being left out of that magic stuff anyway. Sokka didn\u2019t care. Really!\nThat\u2019s why he spent the entire time Zuko was firebending with Jee pacing up and down in his room. Because he didn\u2019t care and it didn\u2019t bother him. Obviously.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are you hanging around Jee so much?\u201d Sokka asked Zuko immediately after his firebending practice.\n\u201cNo reason,\u201d Zuko answered too quickly. Defensively, Sokka thought to himself. Ah-ha! He was right to be suspicious! That funny feeling inside was just his gut and it was right!\u00a0\nSokka tried not to respond, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t doing the thing with the guards anymore. You know, because of power dynamics and stuff.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing the thing with the -- I\u2019m not!\u201d Zuko snapped back and woah, okay, maybe he was getting a little upset here. Sokka should calm this down.\n\u201cGood!\u201d Sokka snarled, doing exactly the opposite of calming down. Why was he mad? Why did he care?\n\u201cWhy are do you even care?\u201d Zuko asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Sokka furiously snapped back, because he couldn\u2019t exactly say, \u2018because the thought of you and Jee on a date makes me want to claw my chest out and I have no idea why\u2019. He didn\u2019t even know why he was having this arguing with Zuko. It felt like some other Sokka had hijacked his brain and taken the reigns.\n\u201cI don\u2019t get you!\u201d burst out of Zuko\u2019s mouth. \u201cFirst, you want me to date Jee. You basically shove me at him. But now that I\u2019m actually getting along with him, you don\u2019t even want us to be friends?\u201d\n Yes, exactly, was Sokka\u2019s immediate thought, but even his mouth recognized that was insane.\nUnfortunately, Zuko wasn\u2019t done ranting. \u201cGod, it\u2019s like you\u2019re jealous or something, which I know you aren\u2019t because,\u201d but Sokka didn\u2019t hear anymore of the words coming out of Zuko\u2019s mouth.\nJealous. Oh my God, was Sokka jealous?\nHe couldn\u2019t be. He couldn\u2019t be because he didn\u2019t like Zuko. He liked girls. He thought of Suki and -- you know, breasts -- and yep, definitely still attracted to her. Women were still amazing.\nBut then he thought of Zuko, and for some strange reason the day in garden when he was taking out Zuko\u2019s hair piece popped into Sokka\u2019s mind and he wanted to grab Zuko and run his hands through his hair over and over again. Sokka felt sick and weird and like he didn\u2019t understand what was happening at all. His throat started to close reflexively in on itself.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d he told Zuko shakily, as quickly as he could.\n\u201cWait!\u201d Zuko called, but Sokka didn\u2019t look back. If he had looked back, he would\u2019ve seen Zuko staring despondently after him, face twisted and guilty.\nBut Sokka didn\u2019t look.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSokka kept walking until he found Katara, which meant that he found Aang, because God forbid these two spend a minute outside of each other's immediate sight line.\n\u201cHey Sokka!\u201d Aang chirped.\n\u201cKatara,\u201d he said, \u201cI need to talk to you. Alone. Right now.\u201d\nKatara narrowed her eyes. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Aang come?\u201d\n\"Because!\"\u00a0\n\"I think that Aang shouldn't be excluded just because you --\"\n\u201cUm, actually that\u2019s fine,\u201d Aang said nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go.\u201d\nKatara sent Aang a betrayed glare. Aang smiled nervously back and put both hands behind his back. \u201cFine,\u201d Katara agreed, and let Sokka drag her away to his room. She crossed her arms over her shoulders. \u201cWhat is this about? And why couldn\u2019t Aang be here? He gives great advice, you know.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s debatable but --\u201d\n\u201cActually it isn\u2019t --\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Sokka said loudly, cutting Katara off and refocusing the conversation. \u201cI have an important question. For. You. About things. And also about stuff. It\u2019s definitely about both things and stuff.\u201d\nKatara, impressively, raised only one eyebrow. Zuko was the only other person Sokka knew who could raise only one eyebrow, and that was probably just because Zuko only had one eyebrow.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Sokka said, defeated. \u201cCan you like, could I like, you know,\u201d Sokka said. \u201cIs it possible that in a completely hypothetical scenario that I -- with um, breasts, which I definitely enjoy, could, like, opposite like them?\u201d\n\u201cSokka,\u201d Katara said, not very patiently, \u201cwhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cI --\u201d he took a steadying breath. \u201cI like Suki,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 good?\u201d Katara said.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sokka said, and then got a bit sidetracked. \u201cI mean, we aren\u2019t really in love or even really together anymore, but she\u2019s amazing and I do still love her and --\u201d\n\u201cSokka, I know,\u201d Katara reminded him.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Sokka said, and determinedly looked his sister in the eye. \u201cI like Suki,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what if I also liked someone else?\u201d\nKatara soften a bit at that. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019ve been worried about you. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re moving on.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been -- worried?\u201d Sokka asked.\nKatara reached out to put her hand on her brother\u2019s arm. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem happy, when I visit.\u201d\n\u201cBut I am,\u201d Sokka protested weakly. \u201cI\u2019m living with dad in the South Pole. I\u2019m happy.\u201d\nKatara let the subject drop. \u201cI\u2019m glad you told me,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout Suki.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sokka said, drawing out the \u2018l\u2019, \u201cthat\u2019s not exactly \u2026 everything?\u201d\nKatara narrowed her eyes. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She asked. \u201cDo you have a new girlfriend? Already? Are there even any girls in marrying range in the Southern Water Tribe?\u201d\nSokka rubbed the back of his head. \u201cIt\u2019s -- no,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a new girlfriend.\u201d\n\u201cThen what\u2019s the news?\u201d Katara asked.\nSokka wanted to tell her. He wanted to open his mouth and tell Katara everything because he knew that she would hug him and that she wouldn\u2019t care, but he stood there in front of her and he couldn\u2019t do it.\nThe words were stuck in his throat, lodged somewhere in between his throatal flap and his chest. Sokka had always been the plan guy, the logic guy. Sokka didn\u2019t have magic water powers, so he used his brain. And when you thought about things, when you rigorously applied scientific thinking on life, you could always make sense of it. Always.\nBut Sokka couldn\u2019t make sense of this. He didn\u2019t understand how he was feeling -- or why. And he couldn\u2019t tell Katara that. He couldn\u2019t admit that he failed.\n\u201cSokka?\u201d Katara asked, more gently this time. \u201cYou can tell me.\u201d\nAnd Sokka did want to tell her. But he opened his mouth and said instead, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell me who Zuko likes?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t know who the question surprised more, him or Katara, but once he said it, it was like a dam burst open in Sokka\u2019s mind.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Katara asked, blindsided. \u201cWhy would you ask me that?\u201d she added, desperately trying to keep her voice level. But a hint of panic colored her voice nonetheless. \u00a0\n\u201cDoes,\u201d Sokka started, then stopped. The water held, a massive wave, taunt, above Sokka\u2019s head. Waiting to crash down on him.\n\u201cI only didn\u2019t tell you because I wouldn\u2019t want to break Zuko\u2019s trust,\u201d Katara told him, hopelessly. \u201cI -- there\u2019s nothing else to it.\u201d\n\u201cDoes,\u201d Sokka started again. But he started this. He had to finish it. \u201cDoes Zuko like me?\u201d Sokka asked. And the wave crashed down around him because it was true and because he knew it and because he -- he felt -- no.\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d Sokka said, when Katara didn\u2019t answer, \u201cZuko likes me.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Katara swore, finally finding her voice.\nSokka snorted. The noise felt unfamiliar and strange. He was surprised to find it came from him. \u201cWhat, really? You\u2019re going to lie to me now?\u201d\n\u201cI --\u201d then Katara hung her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell him you know.\u201d\nSokka sucked in a breath. He\u2019d said -- he\u2019d thought -- but somehow it still surprised him. He couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\u201cI think,\u201d Sokka said. \u201cI need to go. I think I need a minute. I should,\u201d Sokka said, swallowing dryly. \u201cTalk to Suki. I think.\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Katara agreed, miserably, her sad eyes following all the way the hall. \"I'm sorry, Sokka. I didn't --\" but she didn't finish or Sokka couldn't hear because that was all he could remember later, walking down the halls of the Palace to Suki's room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSokka knew the way to Suki\u2019s room by heart, which was good, because if he had to think about it at all, he\u2019s sure he would\u2019ve gotten lost. \u00a0\nIf he had held any hopes that the walk to her room might\u2019ve cleared his mind or made him feel better, they were dashed when he arrived, just as confused as when he left Zuko. He walked past her room, at first, and had to turn around and walk back. \u00a0\nHim and Suki weren\u2019t together. Not really. He\u2019d, you know, spent a few nights with her in the Palace, and he\u2019d spent every night with her on the trip to the Fire Nation but. They had different lives now.\nThey lived different lives back then, too. When the war ended, she had gone home to Kyoshi and he had gone home to the Southern Water Tribe. Their last goodbye had been just that -- a goodbye. It had also been bittersweet and pained; it had been the start of the end for any sort of romantic relationship they might have had.\nShe would always be one of the great loves of his life and he thought that once they stopped hooking up semi regularly, she would be his best friend.\nHe really needed his best friend right now.\nHe took a breath. He hoped Suki was alone tonight. He knew that she kind of had an on and off thing with one of the guards.\nSokka didn\u2019t mind. Sokka had actually had a brief flirtation with one of the nonbending women from a neighboring tribe, but that had fizzled out almost immediately. It had been surprisingly lonely in the Southern Water Tribe. He had been with his dad a lot, but his dad had also been busy rebuilding the tribe. Sokka tried to help, but there wasn\u2019t always anything he could do. \u00a0\nHis dad was a good leader. He had things under control. And even then, he still let Sokka come along to every meeting, he still asked Sokka for his opinions and thoughts every day. He still included Sokka in every single step of the process. It was everything Sokka thought he wanted after the war -- but he wasn\u2019t like he thought it would be. He hadn\u2019t imagined it would be this lonely. \u00a0\nHe was the only teenager in the Southern Water Tribe and with Katara and Aang busy going off on adventures with Appa, Sokka felt the loss keenly. Sokka had missed them everyday they were gone.\nSokka knocked on the door.\nSuki answered immediately. She took one look at his face, opened her door and let him in. They sat near her bed, on a rug which was soft and nice.\nHer hair was messy and her clothes were loosely tied around her. She wasn\u2019t wearing any make up. It made Sokka\u2019s heart clenched tightly to see her this way, made the blood hum in his veins.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s this thing with Zuko,\u201d he told her, slumped.\n\u201cThat thing you\u2019re doing with the setting him up and the dating?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he told her miserably.\n\"What happened?\" Suki asked him.\n\"I don't know where to start,\" he told her, a little helplessly.\n\"Start with the worst part of today, and we'll work our way backwards from that,\" Suki advised him.\nSokka thought for a moment, about the worst part of the day. It was easy. It had been when Zuko yelled at him early. \u201cHe yelled at me today. For -- I keep trying to set him up,\u201d Sokka told Suki, \u201cand make him happy and I just keep making things worse! He\u2019ll get mad -- or I\u2019ll get mad and I -- don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going wrong.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you should stop?\u201d Suki suggested gently, hand hesitating over his knee.\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Sokka told her.\n\u201cWhy not? Why do you care so much about this?\u201d Suki\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t judgmental or accusing. It was just curious.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sokka repeated, then took a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s just, I\u2019ve been really lonely at the Southern Water Tribe. Even though I have my dad, and Katara and Aang come by sometimes, it\u2019s still really lonely. And then I came here, and I kind of realized that Zuko\u2019s \u2026 all alone? Only without even a father or friends. It\u2019s a bit more complicated. Now. But. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want him to be lonely.\u201d\n\u201cYou were working through your own sense of loneliness viscerally through Zuko,\u201d Suki summarized.\nSokka blinked. \u201cYeah, that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy do you always make so much sense all the time?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m very smart,\u201d Suki told him. \u201cYou should listen to me all the time.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sokka agreed happily. \u201cI should. Um, there\u2019s something else,\u201d he said, nervous this time. \u201cKatara said -- I think -- Zuko --\u201d Sokka closed his mouth, twisting it sideways. No. He didn\u2019t think he could talk about this with Suki yet.\n\u201cWhat does Katara think?\u201d Suki asked. Sokka tried to remember what he had said.\n\u201cOh, nothing,\u201d Sokka said. \u201cJust that he\u2019s upset by the fuss.\u201d\nSuki bit her lip. \u201cI think you\u2019re doing a good thing,\u201d she told Sokka honestly. \u201cMaybe you could ask Zuko why he\u2019s so upset?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sokka said, with obvious reluctance, as the rock kind of dropped. He thought he had a pretty good idea why Zuko was frustrated with him. \u00a0\u201cI just -- don\u2019t want to give up now. It sucks being lonely in your own home. But now -- I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a solution anymore.\u201d\nSuki nodded. \u201cI think you should talk to him about this,\u201d she said and Sokka took that as his cue to stand up.\n\u201cThanks, Suki,\u201d he said, hugging her. \u201cI should go.\u201d It felt wrong to stay the night with her. It felt wrong that he hadn\u2019t told her about Zuko liking him. But it felt more wrong to tell her, somehow.\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t know if he expected Suki to argue, but she just lead him to the door, and Sokka stepped outside.\n\u201cSokka,\u201d Suki said abruptly, when Sokka was about half way out the door, \u201cdo you even want to go back to the Southern Water Tribe?\u201d\nSokka turned to look at her, affronted. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he scoffed. \u201cOf course I do. It\u2019s my home.\u201d\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you have to go back.\u201d\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s finally come home. To me. And he respects me. As a man of the tribe. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted,\u201d Sokka said. He hung his head. \u201cI missed him so much.\u201d\nSuki softened. \u201cI know you did,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI have everything I want. How could I not return home now?\u201d He spoke quickly, desperately, words shoving over each other, trying to make her understand.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for pushing, Sokka.\u201d She put her arm around him, rubbing his shoulder lightly. \u201cI know that Katara doesn\u2019t spend much time down there.\u201d\n\u201cShe stops by occasionally,\u201d Sokka said.\nSuki stopped rubbed Sokka\u2019s shoulder. When she spoke, her voice was so soft Sokka could barely hear it.\n\u201cYou could stay with me,\u201d Suki said. \u201cKyoshi Island isn\u2019t very far.\u201d\nSokka swallowed. The silence felt thick and heavy around them and Sokka wondered if this was the real reason he came to talk to Suki. He wondered if this is what the night had been building to the whole entire time.\n\u201cI --\u201d he said. Suki looked at him steadily. She was so beautiful in front of him, so brave. \u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u201d he told her and he was ashamed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Suki told him. \u201cI couldn't move to the South Pole either.\u201d\n\u201cSuki,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, I think.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re my best friend,\u201d she told him back.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Sokka said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Suki repeated, but then fell silent.\nThis kind of hurt, Sokka thought, but it was a good kind of hurt. The feeling of bone sliding over bone when you were popping your shoulder back in or lining up your bones with a splint.\n\u201cIs this -- is this it? We\u2019re done, right?\u201d Sokka asked.\nSuki gave him an embarrassed expression. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been done for awhile,\u201d she admitted.\nSokka let out a breath of relief. \u201cThat was kind of what I thought too. But it\u2019s kind of my first real break up. And like, we said goodbye and everything, but then we would still kiss sometimes. Like when I visited you on Kyoshi island.\u201d\nSuki laughed. \u201cWe should probably stop doing that.\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Sokka agreed. He stuck out his hand. \u201cFriends?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, you know,\u201d she told him. She gave his hand a squeeze.\nSokka squeezed her hand back. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you too,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were my best girl.\u201d\nShe gave him a smile. \u201cDamn right I was,\u201d and then, unexpectedly, she pulled him into a fierce hug.\nOf course, this was when Zuko showed up.\n\u201cSokka! Thank Agni!\u201d came his voice from down the hall, getting louder. \u201cWait -- um, oh, God, sorry, I\u2019m just -- I didn\u2019t --\u201d\nSokka laughed wetly into Suki\u2019s arm, trying desperately to keep back his blush. He knew what the two of them looked like, half dressed and touching against the door, in the dark, well past midnight.\n\u201cZuko, you insensitive asshole. Get back here.\u201d\n\u201cI -- um, okay.\u201d Zuko came back and how had Sokka never noticed the shy smile Zuko only ever gave him or the way Zuko couldn\u2019t stop staring at Sokka\u2019s and Suki\u2019s clasped hands and wow, Katara was right, Sokka was an idiot and Zuko was about as subtle as a neon sign.\nSokka jumped when he realized everyone was waiting for him to talk.\n\u201cThis is Suki,\u201d Sokka said, without thinking. \u201cIsn\u2019t she, um, amazing?\u201d\nHe watched Zuko\u2019s mouth turn down briefly, and his eyebrows crinkle in confusion and -- was it normal to be staring at someone\u2019s face so much?\n\u201cWe\u2019ve met,\u201d Zuko said dryly. Then added: \u201cI\u2019ve seen her take down twenty men.\u201d Zuko cocked his head sideways at Sokka. \u201cAnd why are you staring at me?\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you staring at me?\u201d Sokka responded inanely. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re the one whose face is staring at my face and not the face that is being stared at by my -- me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not -- staring,\u201d Zuko said, only now he was blushing and his blush was bright and sort of stained his skin and now Sokka was wondering if other things could stain his skin and what that would look like and --\n\u201cIt looks like I really am your best girl,\u201d Suki told him with a smirk. \u201cBest and  last girl.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sokka said, turning to her in a mild to moderately severe panic. \u201cNo, I swear it\u2019s not -- what you think, because I personally -- um, boobs.\u201d he finished. \u201cYou know?\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d Suki said, \u201cYeah, I do know.\u201d\n\u201cYou -- what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve had female lovers,\u201d she told him and that thought effectively wiped away any traces of Zuko or Zuko\u2019s skin or Zuko\u2019s face or Zuko's lips -- woah, where had that come from? Not from Sokka, who was a straight non-gay man with a straight non-gay girlfriend. Only apparently his girlfriend wasn\u2019t straight or non-gay and also wasn\u2019t his girlfriend anymore and --\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Sokka,\u201d Zuko told him, sounding downcast.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sokka said desperately. \u201cPlease leave. For now. But not for later. Because. We will talk. Later. At a time that is not now.\u201d\n\u201cTry not to break the bed,\u201d Zuko told him in his quietly funny sort of way and Sokka tried to not wonder how much that joke had cost to tell.\u00a0\nZuko left after that, which Sokka vaguely thought might be bad in the part of his brain that seemed to be actually functioning and not just emitting static. He felt Suki's hand tighten around his neck, grounding him. Sokka pulled back from their embrace and held himself off the wall, staring at her.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, palms clammy and heart racing, \"You are telling me about this girl on girl action right now,\u201d he demanded.\nSuki\u2019s face fell. \u201cSokka, we\u2019re not -- doing that anymore,\u201d she told him, a little coldly.\n\u201cNo,\u201d his lips were dry, \u201cit\u2019s not like that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cCan we go back inside?\u201d he asked and wordlessly followed her to her bed this time. \u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019ve had female lovers?\u201d\nSuki shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty common on Kyoshi Island.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve also had male lovers,\u201d Sokka said, heart\u00a0ricocheting\u00a0in his chest. \u201cFemale and male lovers. I don\u2019t -- what does that mean?\u201d\nSuki tucked a spare piece of hair around her ear. \u201cIt just means I like both.\u201d\nSokka\u2019s tongue felt heavy and thick in his mouth. His words felt like they were coming from someone else. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could do that.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d she said, simply. \u201cWhy --\u201d and then her expression cleared. \u201cOh. You didn\u2019t know?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sokka said hoarsely. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\nFor the second time that night, Sokka felt himself being wrapped up into a hug by his ex girlfriend.\nIt felt the like world shifted half a degree and everything was the same only Sokka could see everything sharper, clearer now. Shadows slide into to focus and corners and curves cut through the swaths of colors and shades. The world was bright again, like it was whenever Sokka thought about the Southern Water Tribe. \u00a0\nSokka didn\u2019t have to choose between men or women and he didn\u2019t have to choose between Water Tribe or not.\nAll he had wanted to do for so long was to be a man in the tribe -- a leader, like his father.\nAnd he still wanted that. But he was starting to realize that no matter where he lived or what he did, he would be a man in the eyes of his father. In the eyes of his tribe. His father would be proud no matter what he did and no matter where he went, he would always be Water Tribe, even if he didn't live in the South Pole, even if he liked men as much as women, or Zuko as much as Suki.\u00a0\nIt was a strange sense of peace -- of liberty -- that Sokka didn\u2019t quite know what to do with yet.\nBut for the first time since the war ended, it felt like Sokka could breathe easy again.\nHe spent that night with Suki, wrapped around each other in a silent sexless gesture that was a \u2018goodbye\u2019 and a \u2018hello\u2019 and an \u2018i love you\u2019 all at once; and when the morning sun hit the edge of the window and entered the room, Sokka felt it entering him, warming him up from the inside until he was lighter than air, untethered and dispersing through the air, high above the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUnfortunately, realizing that he liked Zuko didn\u2019t suddenly mean that he was dating Zuko. No, that would be something Sokka was going to have to do for himself.\nThis part, Sokka thought with unparalleled hubris, is going to be the easy part.\nThat\u2019s what Sokka told himself when he was getting dressed, and it\u2019s when he believed when he was leaving Suki\u2019s room.\nIt\u2019s what he remained convinced of up until Zuko rejected his offer of dinner together.\n\u201cJust the two of us,\u201d Sokka had said. Sokka had also batted his eyelashes.\nZuko had snorted and said, \u201cas if,\u201d to which Sokka had feigned hurt.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d he had asked. He hadn\u2019t batted his eyes this time.\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Zuko told him. \u201cLet me guess -- you\u2019re going to get very sick at the last minute, leaving me alone with some poor noble you managed to rope into your plan.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sokka had insisted. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do that at all!\u201d But Zuko had refused to believe him and had eventually been dragged away by one of his counselors before Sokka could persuade him with his not inconsiderable charms.\nThat\u2019s about when Sokka realized that spending a month tricking your crush into going on dates with other men probably wasn\u2019t the most effective seduction strategy.\nThe second time he tried, he told Zuko that he looked beautiful in the mornings and \u00a0Zuko shoved him into the Turtleduck pond and told him he'd tried the list of compliments strategy already and that he should at least get more creative with his plans. Sokka resolved to work on his delivery.\nThe third time they were at dinner and Sokka was trying to gather his wits about him, but he\u2019d accidently been consuming too much --  way  too much -- of the Fire Nation sweet wine and had spent the entire evening unable to form words, clinging onto to Zuko\u2019s arm. He passed out in Zuko\u2019s room and when he woke up it was well past noon and Zuko was gone.\nThey didn\u2019t get another chance to hang out until a day later, when Sokka insisted Zuko taking a break to spar with him.\nThis would be easy, Sokka thought, and then Zuko swiped his legs out from under him and all other thoughts tumbled out the side of Sokka\u2019s head as was forced to focus on the match.\nAnd then, just was Sokka was getting into the easy rhythm of fighting,  Zuko took his shirt off. Sokka didn\u2019t understand how or why he\u2019d never cared about Zuko\u2019s state of undress before hand but he was definitely making up for that apathy now as Zuko kicked his sexy, sexy way to complete, uncontested victory.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked Sokka when the match was over, frowning.\n\u201cGah,\u201d Sokka said, still looking at Zuko\u2019s chest.\nZuko looked around, self consciously. \u201cWe should --\u201d he said, and offered Sokka hand up.\nSokka took his hand shakily and trembling a little bit from the proximity to Zuko\u2019s naked torso.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Zuko agreed, sadly putting a shirt back on, \u201cit\u2019s getting cold.\u201d\nThis, Sokka knew, was his chance. \u201cHey, Zuko,\u201d he said, and then his mouth went completely dry when Zuko turned around to face him.\nWhy is the hell had Sokka thought that this whole thing would be easier when Zuko was sweaty, exhausted and barely clothed?\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Zuko asked.\nSokka blinked a few times and Zuko chuckled.\n\u201cI think you need to get to bed, buddy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cCan you come with me?\u201d Sokka blurted out, and then slapped his hand over his mouth, mortified.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Zuko said, blinking in adorable, adorable confusion. \u201cI\u2019ll, um, show you. Where your room is.\u201d\nThey actually walked down the hallway holding hands which was insane and Zuko even stayed in Sokka\u2019s room with him waiting for him to fall asleep, which was even more insane. Granted, Zuko slept on what looked like the world\u2019s most uncomfortable chair in the corner, but it was the second night in a row that they\u2019d fallen asleep with each other.\nSokka resolved to give it one more effort the morning. But the next time he woke up, it was still dark out and Zuko was still in the room with him, body curled up in the hard wicker chair in the corner.\nSokka walked over to him softly. \u201cZuko,\u201d he said.\n\u201cUncle,\u201d Zuko protested. \u201cAnother minute.\u201d\nSokka bit back his laughter. This was going to be funny. \u201cIt\u2019s Sokka,\u201d he said.\nZuko\u2019s eyes flew open and he thrashed, nearly tipping himself off the chair. \u201cSokka!\u201d he gasped. \u201cWhat are you -- what am I --\u201d\n\u201cCome back to bed with me,\u201d Sokka said, because clearly his mouth just said things now, without consulting any other parts of himself.\nBut then Zuko said, \u201cokay,\u201d and meekly followed Sokka back to the large, king sized bed and -- promptly fell back asleep.\nMan, Sokka thought, how sleep deprived was this dude? How poorly had Zuko been sleeping? He poked Zuko\u2019s back. Other than a low grumble, there wasn\u2019t much response. Sokka took his time to look at Zuko, who somehow managed to look stressed out, even in sleep.\nIf he had been worried that it might be hard to fall asleep, Zuko\u2019s warmth quickly disabuse him of that fear.\nWhen he woke up for the second time that day, it was to find Zuko\u2019s face less than a foot away from his.\nZuko was staring at him, eyes wide with terror. \u201cI\u2019m -- I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he stuttered out, as soon as Sokka opened his eyes.\nSleepily, Sokka rubbed his eyes and, uncoiling his legs, stretched himself out until he brushed against -- oh, okay.  Oh , okay, Sokka thought, a few seconds later, but it was too late. Zuko\u2019s entire body had seized up.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d Zuko told him. \u201cI\u2019m -- leaving. I\u2019m sorry. It wasn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t mean -- I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He repeated the last part several mores times. \u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Sokka tried to tell him, as Zuko pulled away. \u201cSeriously,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s normal. Zuko, it\u2019s normal!\u201d\nBut Zuko already out the door.\nSokka tried to run after him, pulling the covers around his nubile young body. \u201cI get boners too!\u201d he yelled after Zuko\u2019s retreating back, which only seemed to make Zuko run faster.\nGod, Sokka thought, looking around the empty hallway, that really could\u2019ve gone better.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor the rest of the week, whenever Sokka tried to approach him, Zuko pulled the nearest person around him into a conversation.\nThe first person to fall victim to this was the Minister of Culture who had been on his way to the bathroom when Sokka passed Zuko into the hall. The second Zuko saw him, he physically grabbed the Minister of Culture and pinned him in place, making the terrified man recite facts about traditional Fire Nation ceremonies for thirty minutes, until Zuko was sure Sokka was nowhere around.\nSokka then tried to ambush Zuko outside his room, but Zuko always yelled for his guards and told Sokka that he was sorry but he had work and then he would do this \u2018you know how it is\u2019 shrug that made Sokka just want to grab him and yell, \u201cI\u2019m glad you had a boner!\u201d\nThankfully, Suki talked him out of that plan. Sokka had a feeling Zuko wouldn\u2019t have taken it as a compliment.\nSokka tried staking out the kitchens. Zuko stopped coming down for breakfast. Or lunch. Or dinner.\nHe tried waiting for him in the training room. Zuko fled.\nSokka had never seen another person put even half the effort into anything that Zuko put into avoiding him that day. He would\u2019ve admired the dedication if he wasn\u2019t so frustrated. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy the second day, Sokka had more or less given up and was more or less sitting on his own in the courtyard, morose. Like a pathetic, sexless rabbit-mouse, if you asked Toph. Which people rarely did.\n\u201cWhy are you sitting here like a pathetic, sexless rabbit-mouse,\u201d she started. \u201cAnd where\u2019s Sparky?\u201d\n\u201cWish that I knew,\u201d Sokka replied, despondently, not even touching the sexless rabbit-mouse comment. \u201cWish that I knew.\u201d\nToph wrinkled up her nose. \u201cPlease tell me that isn\u2019t a weird sex thing.\u201d\n\u201cYou -- what?\u201d Sokka said. \u201cObviously not, because Zuko and I aren\u2019t haven\u2019t sex. We\u2019ve never had sex. I mean, I don\u2019t like him. I mean, why would you even ask that?\u201d\nToph shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re heart kind of jackrabbits around him. I kind of assumed you two were going at it like rabbit-mice.\u201d\nSokka opened his mouth to protest. Then he closed it. He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. A little humiliation here and he could be well on his way to victory. \u201cWe aren\u2019t,\u201d he told Toph, \u201cbecause Zuko\u2019s avoiding me.\u201d\nToph rolled her eyes. \u201cYeah, that time yesterday when we were all sitting out in the courtyard and Zuko came in, saw you, screamed, and ran away was  really  subtle.\u201d\n\u201cI just need to talk to him,\u201d Sokka explained. \u201cIf I could just -- explain \u2026\u201d he trailed off.\n\u201cThen you  would be fucking like rabbit-mice?\u201d Toph asked.\n\u201cYeah, pretty much,\u201d Sokka admitted.\nToph thought about it for a minute. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sokka said. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask -- ow!\u201d Toph punched hard.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Toph told him. \u201cNow, walk, dumbass.\u201d\nSokka was a smart man. He grew up with Katara. So when Toph asked to walk, he shut himself up and walked. Into the ground below the palace.\n\u201cWhere are we --\u201d\n\u201cShs!\u201d Toph hissed, feeling the ground out with her feet.\nThey walked in silence for a minute.\n\u201cNo, seriously,\u201d Sokka said, while Toph stomped her foot down experimentally. \u201cWhere --\u201d\n\u201cNo, seriously,\u201d Toph said. \u201cShut the fuck up. This is a very delicate art.\u201d And then she spit on her hands, squatted down and thrust upwards. There was a loud, excruciating groaning of metal and then the ceiling above them -- or, Sokka supposed, the Palace floor, raised open.\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d Toph said bowing and gesturing at her earth staircase, \u201cto Zuko\u2019s chambers.\u201d\n\u201cToph?\u201d Zuko called from above.\n\u201cToph,\u201d Sokka hissed. \u201cWhat about the guards?\u201d\nShe smirked at him, propelling herself out of the pit. \u201cThat sounds like a challenge,\u201d she told him.\n\u201cToph,\u201d Zuko said, voice mildly alarmed, \u201cplease don\u2019t beat up my guards.\u201d\nToph sighed, sounded very put up upon. \u201cFine,\u201d she agreed heavily. \u201cBut only if you promise to hear Snoozles here out.\u201d\nZuko stood at the lip of the floor opening very stiffly. Sokka waited, tense, for his response.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Zuko agreed quietly, sounding small. \u201cSokka, we should probably \u2026 talk.\u201d\nSokka decided that now would not the best time to whoop with joy and jump up and down. Instead, he climbed out of the rip in the floor, smiling.\nThe two boys started at each other across the wreck in the middle of the floor, but of them pointedly silent. It took Toph a minute to realize what they were waiting for.\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cMe. Right. I\u2019ll be going now. Just remember -- the walls have eyes. My eyes.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not creepy at all,\u201d Sokka told Toph, who was too busy pulling Zuko\u2019s floor back together to answer.\nThe silence that fell after Toph left was awkward and left Sokka uncertain how to break it.\nIt didn\u2019t help that Zuko was just standing there, unmoving.\nFinally, Zuko snapped. \u201cWell?\u201d he demanded. \u201cAre you going to talk to me or not?\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Sokka said. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cYou enlisted Toph,\u201d Zuko huffed, \u201cand broke into my room. And now you  don\u2019t know if you want to talk ?\u201d\nThis wasn\u2019t going the way Sokka had imagined it would. For starters, in his imagination, he had, perhaps generously, imagined that he might be saying some words. \u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s sit down,\u201d he suggested. It was a lot harder to confess your feelings than it was to decide to confess your feelings in his opinion. \u201cSuki and I aren\u2019t together,\u201d he said, because first things first.\nHe watched Zuko bite his bottom lip, eyes caught on the brief flash of teeth on pink.\n\u201cOh?\u201d he saw Zuko fidget, pretending not to care. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d Sokka said, feeling reckless. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been together in a long time. She\u2019s one of my best friends. That\u2019s what you saw, the other night.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Zuko asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been growing apart,\u201d Sokka told him. \u201cI thought for a long time that I had to stay in the Southern Water Tribe. I thought I had everything I wanted. I was a man of the tribe, a leader. I thought finally winning the war and saving the world meant I was who I wanted to be. But I'm different. I've changed. I don't think I want the same things. I don't even think I knew what it was I was spending all that time wanting or I'd never have wanted it in the first place.\u201d\nZuko gave him an odd half smile. \u201cI think I know something about that,\u201d he told Sokka.\n\u201cBut I missed everyone.\u201d He looked at Zuko. \u201cI missed you.\u201d\nZuko\u2019s mouth opened silently.\nSokka continued. \u201cI realized that I didn\u2019t have to live in the South Pole to be a man of the Southern Water Tribe. I could go anywhere. And I realized I didn\u2019t want to go to Kyoshi Island. I didn\u2019t even necessarily want to travel with Aang and my sister -- because, obviously, ew.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you want?\u201d Zuko asked.\n\u201cI think I want to stay here,\u201d Sokka said. \u201cWith you. For a little while at least. Before I go somewhere new.\u201d\nInstead of smiling or looking happy, Zuko frowned and dipped his head. \u201cSokka,\u201d he said in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sokka said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve mislead you,\u201d Zuko told him. \u201cThere\u2019s something I haven\u2019t -- told you. Yet. That I think you should know.\u201d Zuko still wouldn\u2019t look at him.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to say --\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Zuko said. \u201cLet me --\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m saying you don\u2019t need to --\u201d\n\u201cI need to, Sokka, I --\u201d\n\u201cZuko, it\u2019s okay, I --\u201d\n\u201cSokka!\u201d Zuko snapped, then shrunk back. \u201cI mean, sorry. I just want to say something. Quickly. Before you, um --\u201d\n\u201cZuko, I know you like me,\u201d Sokka said, which was maybe not what he wanted to say.\nZuko flinched.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sokka said, reaching out to grab Zuko\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, because I like you.\u201d\nBut Zuko tried to pull away. \u201cNot like --\u201d he said.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sokka said, keeping on hand on Zuko\u2019s and putting the other on his chest. \u201cI like you that way,\u201d he said and leaned in to kiss Zuko.\nZuko kissed back immediately, like a drowning man finally given air, his free hand flying to the side of Sokka\u2019s face as if to keep him there. Sokka lost track of time for a minute an hour a day  he didn\u2019t know \u00a0but then there was this moan which Sokka realized was coming from him and fuck, he didn\u2019t know this could feel so good. He needed more.\nHe pressed his body flat against Zuko\u2019s, pushing him backwards, clenching his hand tightly around Zuko\u2019s hand. He moved the hand on Zuko\u2019s chest up, and Zuko arched into him.\nHe wanted to explore every part of this that he could, that he never thought he could before, but Zuko pulled away, panting.\n\u201cI don\u2019t \u2026\u201d he said, lips looks bright red and full. Sokka just wanted to pull him back into another kiss but instead he sat back. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d\n\u201cI like you,\u201d Sokka told him. \u201cTo, like, an embarrassing degree. When you said I was jealous of you and Jee? You were right! I was!\u201d\n\u201cBut --\u201d Zuko said. \u201cYou\u2019re not -- you don\u2019t --\u201d\nOhhhhh. Sokka\u2019s expression cleared. \u201cYou mean I don\u2019t like men?\u201d Sokka said. \u201cNo, I definitely do. I also like women, though,\u201d he added. \u201cJust to clarify. People? Hot.\u201d\nZuko blinked at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty hot,\u201d Sokka said, just to see what would happen. Zuko flushed a deep red. Sokka smirked.\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d Zuko mumbled.\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Sokka replied with a wink. He couldn\u2019t help himself and. Well. If Zuko had any complaints, Sokka couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Well?\" Katara asked. \"What's going on?\"\u00a0\nToph smirked.\u00a0\n\"Toph!\" Katara screeched. \"That's my brother!\"\u00a0\n\"I didn't say anything! Besides, you asked!\"\n\"And you know what,\" Katara said, \"I'm really not sure why.\"\u00a0\n\"Dummy,\" Toph said fondly. \"He might be a dumbass but he's your brother. Of course things were going to be okay.\"\u00a0\n\"I -- thanks Toph,\" Katara said.\u00a0\n\"No problem, Queen,\" Toph responded. \"Now, about the laws around the mineral rocks within ice and not using them into tricking five year old's into thinking I'm a waterbender --\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
