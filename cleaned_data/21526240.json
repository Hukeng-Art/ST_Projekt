    "text": "\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a smell in the Western Air Temple.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNot a fart smell, though (thanks, \n\nAang\n\n), a \n\ngood\n\n smell, like if Katara knew how to cook anything other than rehydrated jerky and whatever Sokka manages to catch, with rice, with whatever vegetables they may or may not have. Sokka knows better than to complain about it, because that\u2019s a great way to not eat, but still.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJerky on rice nights makes him miss Ba Sing Se.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe place was a shitstorm in its own right, but spirits, Sokka misses being able to get almost any kind of noodle under the sun, and fresh meat that he didn\u2019t have to hunt for himself, not cooked by his sister.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWho, he will emphasize, does \n\nthe very best that she can\n\n (you hear that, Katara? Your favorite brother is not ungrateful!), but just doesn\u2019t have the means or the experience of the fancypants, Earth Kingdom noodle-makers. That\u2019s just how it is!\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut Sokka\u2019s smelling something \n\namazing\n\n that definitely isn\u2019t Katara\u2019s cooking.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIdly, Sokka wonders where Zuko\u2019s at.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe dude\u2019s practically a ghost, and that\u2019s fine with him. After chasing them all over the world for months, Sokka never wanted to see him again, but here he is. And he wants to teach Aang firebending?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPlease.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLike any of them are gonna fall for \n\nthat\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYo, Aang, are you holding out on me?\u201d He calls, \u201cSomething smells \n\nawesome.\n\n\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c...\n\nWhat\n\n?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n...That ain\u2019t Aang.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka pokes his head into the room the voice came from and stops dead.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere, sitting at a tiny campfire, is the prince of the Fire Nation himself. Former prince? Is that technically correct? Sokka doesn\u2019t know.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSaid prince of the Fire Nation is sitting cross legged in front of his tiny fire, looking very much like a kangaroo-deer in front of a lantern. There\u2019s a banged up little frying pan in the fire, too, and whatever Zuko\u2019s pushing around in there smells \n\nso good\n\n. There\u2019s a big, flat leaf sitting next to him and on that leaf are some piled up vegetables, some spices, and\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHoly shit, \n\nmeat\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNot fish either, but some unidentifiable red meat that\u2019s already been cut up and cleaned, and\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka wipes his mouth abruptly and closes it. Scowls.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI mean...uh\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko raises the only eyebrow he\u2019s got (and wow, that\u2019s gotta suck), and the edges of his lips tilt up in a very awkward smile, like he\u2019s not sure he\u2019s doing it right. Weirdo.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou could just come in,\u201d he points out and beckons inward with a hand. Sokka doesn\u2019t move. \u201c...Or you could stand there like a weirdo?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWho\u2019s a weirdo?!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka does come in, though, tentatively at first, and then with more confidence when it\u2019s clear that Zuko\u2019s more focused on what\u2019s going on in his pan than Sokka\u2019s malfunction.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou can cook?\u201d he finally asks.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko shrugs.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI lived on a ship for three years, and Uncle thought I needed distractions.\u201d To be fair, he definitely needed distractions, but cooking lessons had only worked so well. \u201cAnd then, once, Uncle tried to brew tea from a poisonous flower and almost died. So\u2026you know.\u201d Zuko shrugs again. \u201cAnd it\u2019s cheaper.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka remembers how much the Upper Ring Ba Sing Se noodles had cost, and that was on their VIP stipend, and sees Zuko\u2019s logic.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey fall into a silence that should be \n\nway \n\nmore awkward than it is, and Zuko goes back to what he\u2019s doing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s too bad that Sokka is not meant for silence.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat are you making?\u201d he asks eventually.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust some potato-chokes with onion-snips, and the squirrel-possum.\u201d It\u2019s not a classy meat but Zuko\u2019s not exactly classy anymore, is he? And it beats fucking \n\nfishing\n\n. In go the rest of the veg and meat and a healthy spoonful of chili-grass-garlic paste, with a slightly smushed, about-to-go-bad tomato, which he proceeds to squish further with the spoon. \u201cHere, if you\u2019re going to talk, you should be useful. Stir.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe thrusts the spoon at Sokka to keep the food moving and rummages around in a bag, eventually fishing out a package of flour. Another large leaf goes down, and zuko pours out a few handfuls of flour onto it, eyeballs a sprinkle of salt and some water and oil into the mix, and starts kneading.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBread, too?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re gonna do with that, we don\u2019t have an oven\u2014\u201c\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko just gives him an exasperated but weirdly tolerant \n\nlook\n\n. He works his dough, splits it into pieces, and stretches them out into maybe-sorta-circular-but-not-really shapes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t need one. They can go right on the coals.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs if to prove his point, Zuko does exactly that, tossing the dough onto the coals next to the pan and letting them sit until appropriately browned and slightly charred before flipping them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe food in the pan seems cooked to Sokka\u2019s inexperienced-at-cooking but experienced-at-food-poisoning eyes. Zuko snuffs the flames down to embers and gestures for him to take it off the fire. He pulls the bread off too, brushes off the soot left from the coals, and hands one to Sokka.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve only got one plate so we can just eat it out of the pan, if you\u2019d like some,\u201d he offers.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor a moment, Sokka\u2019s tempted to refuse, because he doesn\u2019t trust Zuko as far as he can throw him...but it wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t see everything that went into the pan. Hell, he even helped cook some of it! So, in the end, he takes the offered bread, and watches how Zuko tears off a piece of his own and uses it to scoop some of the food out of the pan.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting way of eating, and not one that Sokka would have expected from a prince.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka thinks of princely eating, and he thinks of three forks and tiny portions and food he can\u2019t recognize, not eating with your hands right out of the frying pan. He definitely doesn\u2019t care whether it\u2019s princely or not the minute the first bite goes in mouth, because it\u2019s hot and spicy and \n\nreally good\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBefore Sokka knows it, the pan is empty and the bread is gone, and he would have tried \n\nway\n\n harder to switch Zuko onto their side months ago if he\u2019d know he could have been eating like this the whole time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe other boy is giving him a pretty interesting look, too, considering but tinged with confusion. Just the way Sokka likes it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe interesting expression on Zuko\u2019s face goes a little self-conscious. Sokka\u2019s surprised to find that, despite himself, he wants to reassure him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, dude,\u201d he tells him, \u201cReally good. If fighting the Fire Lord doesn\u2019t work out, you could definitely just open up a restaurant!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf anything, Zuko actually looks \n\nmore\n\n stressed out. Sokka flounders.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat else do you know how to make?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko shrugs.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know...just putting stuff together, I guess? Cook just sort of threw things together from whatever we bought at port and after Uncle almost\u2026\u201d For a moment, Zuko looks a bit sick to his stomach but barrels on anyway, \u201cI just asked around wherever we stopped, I guess. Whatever\u2019s local that wouldn\u2019t poison either of us. My mo\u2014 I learned how to make some of the osechi-ryori dishes when I was little, for the New Year. Gyoza, too. Just...things here and there, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka has a distinct feeling that \n\nthings here and there\n\n means a lot more than Zuko intends. His first instinct is to poke at him, but manages to stop himself because that\u2019s the most words he\u2019s ever heard the guy say at one time that wasn\u2019t a furious tantrum about capturing Aang or screaming profanities.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(Sokka didn\u2019t even realize how many swear words one person could know until he saw Zuko get worked up, and then, suddenly, it was \n\nvery\n\n easy to believe that he\u2019d spent three years with sailors. Gran-gran would have a \n\nheart attack.\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen he thinks about it, he realizes that while he\u2019s heard a lot of shouting (\n\na lot\n\n of shouting), he hasn\u2019t ever just...heard him talk. Not really.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf Sokka pokes fun at him, that probably won\u2019t ever happen again.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt would be a stretch to say that he and Zuko are friends. It\u2019s a stretch to say that he even trusts him, except that he\u2019s the only option they\u2019ve got for Aang learning to firebend, so here he is. Sokka\u2019s accepted that they\u2019re stuck with him. For the time being, anyway. But it\u2019s not a horrible thought, Sokka realizes, to have someone else on their side. To maybe, someday but probably not right now, be friends.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut to do that he\u2019s going to have to trust him, and Sokka\u2019s not totally that he can.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo he lets it go and just leans back a little, rubs his belly in contentment. With the grace of someone used to it, Zuko sprinkles some soap powder into his pan and gives it a quick scrub with water from a pot, bends it dry in seconds.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou should teach my sister.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko gives an unflattering and not princely at all snort.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPretty sure if I go within six feet of your sister, I\u2019m dead.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt \n\nsounds \n\nlike a joke, but Sokka knows Katara and he\u2019s seen in person who \n\nZuko\n\n got for a baby sister, and both of them know that it\u2019s not.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAt the very least, you could be a \n\nlittle\n\n more sociable. I know from experience that it\u2019s hard to stay on your guard when you\u2019re eating,\u201d Sokka tells him with a grin, inviting him to share in the joke. He\u2019s not expecting Zuko\u2019s face to do this funny twitch and for him to abruptly turn away, his whole posture tense and stressed again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t...I wasn\u2019t trying to get you to let your guard down, okay? I wasn\u2019t...you showed up \n\nfirst\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2026\n\nOh\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka leans forward and, possibly against his better judgement, wraps his fingers around Zuko\u2019s bicep and squeezes firmly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDude. I was \n\njoking\n\n. Okay? Like...I know we\u2019ve had our shit, okay, but there\u2019s no way in hell that you\u2019re slick enough to pull something like that off. No matter what Katara thinks.\u201d And that\u2019s not a lie, either, Sokka realizes. Zuko shouted about half of every plan he ever had to capture Aang right to their faces; he\u2019s so honest that it almost physically hurts, for better or for worse.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s pretty sure he knows who got the manipulation skills in the family, anyway.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko gives him a look that contains such a horrifying amount of gratitude that Sokka feels like he\u2019s gonna break out in hives. He didn\u2019t even say anything that \n\nnice\n\n, what the fuck.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Sokka leaves to head back to the rest of his friends, he can\u2019t get the image of Zuko, very alone in that damp and moody room, all by himself, and how he\u2019d actually been enjoyable company.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nZuko\u2019s coronation is \n\nwild\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s because of the end of the war or if it\u2019s because Zuko\u2019s the closest thing to a sane Fire Lord there\u2019s been for a century at least, but the entire country seems out of their minds with joy. The night Zuko\u2019s crowned is a riot of merrymaking and free flowing alcohol and Sokka spends most of it drunk. To be fair, so does Dad, but the difference is that Sokka doesn\u2019t mean to; it just sort of...happens.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd it feels like one minute, he\u2019s dancing with Suki and the next, Toph\u2019s depositing him next to the new Fire Lord who looks nearly constipated with awkwardness at being constantly bowed to and greeted and toasted when two weeks ago, he was to be killed on sight. It\u2019s a weird backspin, but Sokka\u2019s here for it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHeeeeeeey,\u201d Sokka says and definitely doesn\u2019t lean against Zuko the first chance he gets and definitely doesn\u2019t make every single guard in the vicinity twitch. He\u2019s a touchy feely guy, okay? They\u2019d better get used to it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGet used to what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nOh fuck, he said that out loud.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou did, you definitely did,\u201d Zuko tells him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you a mindreader?\u201d Sokka asks and receives the very first snort of laughter from Fire Lord Zuko, the First Of His Name.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, definitely not. You\u2019re just really drunk.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCall it like it is,\u201d Sokka insists, \u201cI\u2019m \n\nshitfaced\n\n. Get it right.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay, Ambassador Shitfaced.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nWhat\n\n about my ass???\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka feels the vague sensation of Zuko rubbing his temples and laughing very, very quietly to himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou started earlier than I thought,\u201d he says and sighs a little bit. It probably goes against Fire Lordy propriety for Zuko to sling his arm around Sokka\u2019s shoulders the way that he does and it\u2019s definitely against whatever passes now for royal protocol for Sokka to rub his cheek on Zuko\u2019s fancy robes. He can\u2019t help it, though, they\u2019re \n\nso soft\n\n. He deserves soft things and should wear them \n\nall the time.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka means to tell him that but what comes out instead is a cheerful \n\nyou\u2019re so soft\n\n, and he gets the most glorious visual of Zuko going bright red all the way down those super soft robes. Zuko hails a waiter without a word, takes the offered glass of sake that\u2019s definitely for sipping and not shooting, and knocks it back.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou gonna be good, buddy? Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you drink before,\u201d Sokka points out. Zuko leans into him hard, warm and loose and \n\nsoft, \n\nwhuffs an amused breath into Sokka\u2019s hair.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Had less than you, at any rate.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s the fucking truth right there.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka feels \n\nawesome\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be so good at this, man,\u201d he tells him, doesn\u2019t even try to disguise the surprising amount of open affection in his tone. Couldn\u2019t even if he tried, but he doesn\u2019t care to. Zuko deserves to know that people give a shit about him. \u201cLike...fuck, dude. You\u2019re gonna be \n\namazing\n\n. You know that, right? Heard it here first. Best Fire Lord \n\never\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko throws his hand up for another shot of sake.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he breathes, and the frankly ridiculous amount of gratitude there makes Sokka want to hug him, so he does. Every guard gives another twitch but Zuko waves away their concern with an indulgent hand wave in their direction.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSomehow Sokka manages to end up in his own bed despite the revelry (and how fucking \n\nweird \n\nis it to have his own room in the Fire Nation palace?) but he\u2019s not entirely sure how he got there. He remembers dancing, and drinking, and accosting Zuko a significant amount and then...walking? Or being walked. He definitely remembers an arm around his shoulders and he remembers rumbling voices that are warm and kind and familiar, remembers Katara\u2019s exasperated affection at how both he and dad are drunk as shit.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka remembers somebody pulling the blankets down and pushing him into bed, and \n\nholy shit\n\n being an ambassador is gonna be great if he gets a bed this nice.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe remembers his boots being pulled off and then being tucked in by someone with calm, callused hands. Sokka hasn\u2019t been tucked into bed since Mom did it, and he sort of remembers petting the person\u2019s head? Maybe?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey had soft hair. Maybe dark hair? Spirits, drunk Sokka is useless.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDrunk Sokka is \n\nimpossible.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNot-drunk Sokka wakes up the next morning with a pounding headache and crusty eyes and his mouth tasting like something fucking died in it. He\u2019s never drinking again. Ever.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhich is probably not going to be true, but it\u2019s true right now and that\u2019s what counts.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a glass of water and a covered dish on his nightstand. This ambassador thing is getting better and better, if he\u2019s getting sent breakfast. This is going to be \n\nawesome\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s just scrambled eggs with diced and fried bacon on top of rice but somehow, it\u2019s one of the best things he\u2019s ever tasted.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSokka gets dumped.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s not surprised by it, honestly. He and Suki had tried to do the long distance thing since it had worked fairly well before, but apparently long distance during wartime when everyone has a ton going on and long distance during peacetime are\u2026different.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDifferent enough that when Sokka receives the message, he doesn\u2019t have to open it to know what it is. He just \n\nknows\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t still hurt, though, and he devotes a good few days to moping and slinking and sighing through life before Zuko\u2019s finally had it with him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGet up, Ambassador Depression,\u201d Zuko grumbles and physically pulls Sokka up from where he\u2019s laying facedown in the sun in the gardens, waiting for sweet death to come take him away, \u201cI cannot deal with this.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNeither could Suki.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka starts crying again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko sputters in horror but keeps manhandling him like Sokka\u2019s some kind of emotionally contagious pentapus, drags him out of the gardens and into his office. Spirits, Zuko has a great fucking chair. Maybe being Fire Lord is worth it just for the sweet seat.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka then remembers the screaming match the teenage Fire Lord had with an unreasonable General who just wouldn\u2019t \n\nlisten\n\n a few weeks back and thinks solidly \n\nno\n\n, it ain\u2019t worth it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko hates sitting on the throne, too. He only does it for ceremony and for very formal occasions and the look on his face is always so surly and sour whenever he does that they all try and get him off of it as soon as humanly possible. Sokka\u2019s pretty sure that it\u2019s because it reminds him too much of his dad, that he can\u2019t even sit there without feeling awful. Same with the raised dais in the meeting room; he won\u2019t touch it, just sits at the same table with everyone else.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko\u2019s office is way more of a \n\nhim\n\n space. It\u2019s where he prefers to work, where he has private meetings, where he and Iroh have tea. It\u2019s where Sokka\u2019s caught him napping a few times when he can get it and a few times when he just crashes and no one has the heart to move him, sprawled out on the most comfortable sofa ever created by human hands. It\u2019s where Sokka\u2019s seen him, hunched over his desk with his head in his hands.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka\u2019s whole job is communication. Sometimes he travels but mostly he stays in the palace and helps prevent a cultural breakdown between his people and Zuko\u2019s, because they may share the same words but those words don\u2019t always mean the same thing when it comes to politics and global relations. So where did he go wrong with Suki?\n\n\u00a0\n\nDid he ignore her?\n\n\u00a0\n\nDid he make her feel unloved?\n\n\u00a0\n\nDid she doubt his \n\nloyalty\n\n to her?\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat could he have done to make it better, other than quit his job? She never would have asked it of him, never would and never did, but in her letter it was clear. She cited \n\ngrowing apart\n\n, and \n\ngoing in different directions\n\n. If he hadn\u2019t taken this job, would they still have been going in the same direction? If he hadn\u2019t said yes to Zuko, would he still be single right now?\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut that\u2019s not fair, he thinks into the warm wood of Zuko\u2019s desk.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNobody \n\nmade\n\n him do this. Sokka \n\nwanted\n\n this, wanted to help but also wanted it for himself, and he\u2019s good at it. He\u2019s really, really good at it and everybody says so, not just Zuko.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka knows that he\u2019s needed and he \n\nlikes \n\nit.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka lifts his head. At some point during his moping, Zuko\u2019s left him alone in his office, and somehow that\u2019s even worse because that warm, comfortable space is made less so without him there. Sokka drops his head back down with a hard \n\nthunk.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTrying to give yourself a concussion, too?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Somka grumbles into the desk. Something smells good, and sweet. He lifts his head again and there\u2019s Zuko standing shyly in his own doorway, holding a\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nCake?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid you make \n\ncake\n\n?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko shrugs and approaches, pushes aside some scrolls to make room. It\u2019s not a big cake but it\u2019s big enough, and he sets it ceremoniously in front of Sokka.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s \n\nsprinkles\n\n on it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s breakup cake,\u201d the \n\nfucking Fire Lord\n\n tells him. \u201cWhen Mai broke up with me, I ate an entire cake by myself. Uncle said it might make you feel better too.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka is going to murder Uncle Iroh but only after he hugs Zuko within an inch of his awkward, impossible life and even then, only after he eats that damn cake, because it smells amazing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko hands him a fork and Sokka doesn\u2019t even feel a little bit bad about digging into the white frosting with confetti sprinkles. It\u2019s vanilla cake and it\u2019s \n\nso good\n\n, and Sokka suddenly feels like crying again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe may be crying again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy does breakup cake taste so good?\u201d He mumbles into his next mouthful, and Zuko pats him on the shoulder.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCould be the tears,\u201d he tells him gently and uses the heel of his hand to brush at Sokka\u2019s cheeks, \u201cOr it could be the good vanilla.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nZuko nearly dies.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNearly, no thanks to any of the rest of them who stand there half stupid when the Fire Lord freezes after taking his first bite at the start of the meal, goes milk pale, and shoves his fingers down his own throat to vomit into his sleeve just in time to start wheezing and drop to the ground.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s about the scariest thing that Sokka\u2019s ever seen in his life, watching, useless, as Iroh starts chest compressions and breathing for him until the healers can get him stabilized. Less scary but more horrible, if that\u2019s even possible, is when Zuko spikes the fever. It goes so high that he hallucinates and starts crying so desolately for his mom that Sokka ignores the protests of his doctors and climbs right into his bed and holds him, curls around his body and holds him so tight that the tremors quaking through Zuko\u2019s frame shake Sokka\u2019s too.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt turns out that if Zuko had eaten any more than he had or made himself throw up any slower, he definitely would have been dead.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIroh sits by his bed the entire time with his head in his hands.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey found the culprit quickly but that doesn\u2019t really make anyone feel better.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt doesn\u2019t change anything.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt doesn\u2019t change that Zuko was almost murdered right there in front of everyone, because someone with a grudge didn\u2019t approve of him giving a shit about making the world better.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko doesn\u2019t die but he\u2019s not the same.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe works even harder and for longer hours, balancing treaties and war reparations and a sustainable, long term plan for his country with obsessively researching poisons. He doesn\u2019t want to delegate, doesn\u2019t want to let Uncle shoulder his load, doesn\u2019t want to make any concessions for his health or safety.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want a taster either.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s its own little private shitshow, because what the hell kind of nearly-poisoned-to-death, idiot Fire Lord refuses a taster?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis one, apparently, because merely mentioning it as an option is a great way to get yelled at real quick, and eventually people quit trying even though it\u2019s an open secret that everyone thinks he has a death wish. Sokka knows better.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not a death wish that Zuko has.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko just doesn\u2019t want anyone to die for him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe problem is that he refuses a taster but also won\u2019t eat unless he\u2019s prepared it himself or seen it made, and he doesn\u2019t have much time for himself as it is. So now he\u2019s not really eating, either, and Sokka\u2019s not sure how long he can let Zuko manage himself before someone does something really stupid.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nReally stupid\n\n comes quickly in the form of Uncle Iroh reaching his own breaking point with Zuko\u2019s stubbornness, swiping a dumpling off of his untouched plate and popping it in his mouth.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko goes absolutely out-of-his-mind \n\nballistic, \n\nshouting and throwing things off his desk and shaking Uncle back and forth by his collar, demanding that Uncle \n\nspit it out, \n\n\nplease\n\n\n, spit it out\n\n, until he\u2019s a silently shivering wreck in the middle of his half destroyed office.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis eyes are \n\nhuge\n\n and his grip on his desk has left deep gouging marks, singed black and charred.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka can\u2019t make himself move forward or back, just stands there like a fucking dummy.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIroh stares his nephew down, motionless. Eats another dumpling. Swallows.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko trembles where he stands and looks like he\u2019s going to start crying.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Sokka realizes, suddenly and with more clarity than almost anything in his entire life, that Uncle\u2019s plan might work with anyone else but it \n\nwon\u2019t work on Zuko\n\n. Not the way he wants it to. He wants Zuko to see reason, but the problem is that Zuko sees it and has already made up his mind that it\u2019s an unacceptable option.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe guy will \n\ndie\n\n stubborn and pushing him this hard won\u2019t do anything but hurt him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo Sokka makes up his mind and takes that step forward, kneels on the floor to gather the scrolls and maps that were thrown in one hand, takes Zuko by the arm in the other.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he tells him gently, \u201cLet\u2019s go take a walk.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTheir walk takes them down to the kitchens.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka gestures for the lone guard that Zuko\u2019s permitted to follow him to clear off a spot at the prep table and then drops the scrolls on it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere, now you can work too. Sit.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko sits.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He asks, finally, looking, despite the fancy robes and crown, like he belongs right there where he is.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka shrugs.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEating stresses you out, I get that. And right now, you don\u2019t really have a lot of people you can trust with your food.\u201d Sokka starts rummaging through cabinets, through the pantries, peeks into the cold box to see what\u2019s there. \u201cSo until you do, I\u2019m gonna take care of it. Whatever I\u2019ve gotta do to help you feel safe again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko sits there, looking so bewildered and so young, until he can speak again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCook? I guess not really. But I\u2019ve watched you enough, you know?\u201d Because he has watched Zuko, probably more than he wants to admit. Has admired the easy way he handles a knife, admired the attention he pays to whatever he makes. Admired the way he cares about it, and the way he uses it to care about others. \u201cWorse comes to worst, it\u2019s just burned. You won\u2019t die from a little char, will you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat startles a laugh out of him and Zuko leans forward, props his chin up on his hand. He looks fucking wiped.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka hopes that Iroh will apologize to him later for scaring the absolute shit out of him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think any firebender worth their flame would die from that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s as good as Sokka knows he\u2019s going to get as far as permission goes. The head chef has already cleared out of the way so Sokka\u2019s got the kitchen mostly to himself. He hums a little and pulls out some potato-chokes, some onion-snips, a jar of chili-grass-garlic paste.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo squirrel-possum,\u201d he says, \u201cBut we can make do with something else, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko\u2019s jaw drops open when it clicks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you really\u2026? That\u2019s the first\u2014\u201c\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe first meal we ever had together, yup.\u201d Sokka shoots him an indulgent grin, because Zuko\u2019s ignoring his scrolls and shedding his outer robe, draping it over the stool. He just can\u2019t help himself. He comes round and Sokka hands him a bag of flour and little unmeasured bowls each of water, salt, and oil. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the bread to you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is the first time they\u2019ve really cooked together. Mostly Zuko cooks and Sokka watches and talks at him, and Sokka had been going for a meaningful role reversal but somehow this is better. Mostly because he\u2019s still pretty sure that he\u2019ll definitely fuck up the bread.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe can manage cutting vegetables into chunks, though, and he knows he can handle cutting up the meat, and the stove might be fancy and fit for a royal but all Sokka can see is that little flickering fire that feels so long ago and so far away.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou know, when my dad asked me when we became friends, I told him that it was when I knew you were ride-or-die enough to help break him out of jail with no plan on hand,\u201d Sokka says, pushes the potato-chokes around in the pan and hopes they don\u2019t burn, \u201cBut that was a lie.\u201d Zuko\u2019s hands pause their kneading for a beat, two, then continue. \u201cI think that it was this, you remember? I didn\u2019t trust you for shit, you know?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou has no reason to,\u201d Zuko says reasonably, not hurt by the comment at all. \u201cHonestly, it was probably one of the smarter choices you\u2019d made.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis was true, objectively speaking, but man, how much easier life would have been if they could have gotten to trust \n\nsooner\n\n. Who knows if they\u2019d be in the same place if they had, though? Sokka\u2019s pretty content with his lot in life and, minus Zuko\u2019s recent assassination attempt that\u2019s fucked up most everything in some way, he\u2019s not sure he\u2019d change a thing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNot much, anyway.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to eat soot this time, at least,\u201d Zuko actually \n\njokes\n\n as he throws the stretched flatbreads into the oven.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, the soot gave it that little special something.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome to lick the coals later, then.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHard pass, thanks.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko snorts and tries to pretend that he\u2019s not hovering over Sokka and his pan and low-key babysitting them. Sokka swats him on the shoulder and shoos him back to his seat.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s probably only because everybody\u2019s used to Sokka being Sokka that the guard doesn\u2019t even so much as twitch at somebody putting their hands on the Fire Lord.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOr it could have been that Zuko \n\nlaughs\n\n at him and lets himself be shooed, looking more relaxed than Sokka\u2019s seen him in a while.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe meat looks done and bread is just this side of burnt but in a good way when he gingerly pulls it off the rack with his fingertips. Sokka doesn\u2019t bother with plates, just plunks the pan down on a potholder.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo plates?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNot unless you wanna do the dishes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko smirks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the Fire Lord. I don\u2019t have to do my own dishes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka bops him with a piece of bread and sits down in the second stool. He\u2019s charmed by the feeling of nostalgia and comfort this reenactment brings but finds that he\u2019s even more charmed by Zuko this time around. Sokka\u2019s not sure whether it\u2019s his level of trust in Sokka himself or because, like last time, he saw everything that went into it, but when Zuko tears off a piece of bread and goes in, he finds that he can\u2019t look away from him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you good?\u201d The Fire Lord asks. Sokka realizes that he\u2019s just staring, half spellbound, and flusters.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo no no no, I\u2019m good!\u201d He exclaims. \u201cHold on a sec, you\u2019ve got some\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka reaches out a hand and swipes a tiny bit of tomato off of Zuko\u2019s cheek and instead of wiping it onto a napkin, just licks it off. Zuko goes very, very still, the look on his face unreadable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSlowly, he puts down his bread.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says, voice barely louder than a whisper. \u201cI\u2019m pretty, uh, bad at reading a room. But can I\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nCan Zuko what? Zuko\u2019s the Fire Lord, he can do pretty much whatever he wants within reason\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko kisses him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not a long or deep kiss but it\u2019s very sweet and so brief that Sokka regrets that he spends most of it frozen like a statue before his brain goes\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOh.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd kisses back just as Zuko pulls away from him. He\u2019s red all down his neck and looks torn between mortification and terror and elation. Sokka \n\nstares \n\nat him, because Zuko\u2019s always been an objectively pretty dude but he\u2019s even prettier like this, even if Sokka definitely wants to kiss him until he stops looking so afraid.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c...hi,\u201d is all his stupid brain can come up with, and \n\nso much \n\nin his life makes \n\nway more sense now\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c...hi.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka sways closer and finds Zuko\u2019s hands, laces their fingers together, holds. It feels right to do it, like he should have been doing it for ages by now and just hasn\u2019t, for whatever reason.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust, uh, for future reference, you are more than welcome to do that again \n\nliterally\n\n any time you want.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCan I do again right now?\u201d Zuko\u2019s trying to pull off coy but it\u2019s not really working because he keeps smiling about it. This time Sokka\u2019s the one who moves, kisses Zuko\u2019s stupidly pretty, stupidly stubborn, stupidly annoying and Fire Lordy face right there in front of his guard. He cradles Zuko\u2019s face in his hands and pulls away only to get another good look at him, just so that he can kiss him again. He feels like his heart\u2019s gonna fucking explode.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s funny because he\u2019s not \n\nsurprised\n\n by this at all.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe, he thinks very deep down, when Sokka realizes that he and the Fire Lord are making out right there in the middle of the kitchen and starts laughing hysterically, the only thing that he\u2019s surprised about is how long it took for them to get there.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0"
