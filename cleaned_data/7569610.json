    "summary": "<p>Minato knows at the beginning of the week that it's going to be a hellish one. Mostly because it starts with the kidnapping of one of his two remaining students, only a year after they'd lost the first one. He just doesn't realize at the time that it's not going to be a hellish week - it's going to be hell for quite a bit longer than that.</p>\n<p>It all starts with Rin's kidnapping, and her subsequent rescue at the hands of a mysteriously appearing, monstrously strong, murderously violent woman.</p>\n<p>A woman with cotton candy pink hair.</p>\n<p>It only devolves from there.</p>\n<p>In which some time has passed, everyone still has no idea what the heck is going on, and Sasuke and Sakura kill more dudes.</p>\n<p>\"Holy water cannot help you now.<br>See, I've come to burn your kingdom down,<br>And no rivers and no lakes can put the fire out.<br>I'm gonna raise the stakes,<br>I'm gonna smoke you out.\" - Seven Devils, Florence and the Machine</p>",
    "notes": "<p>To the best of my knowledge, I have stuck 100% with canon in regards to Team 7's abilities. The only embellishment I added, which does play a big part of this story, is the fact that Sakura now uses a distinctive sword.</p>\n<p>I had no choice. Kishimoto made her boring as heck. She was literally just a pink haired Tsunade, so I gave that girl a sword, and bam. Distinctive.</p>\n<p>(Forgot to add: Sakura's dressed like in Boruto the Movie, Sasuke's dressed like in the manga epilogue, and Naruto's dressed like he did in the Pain Invasion. Because I can do what I want with my universe, dang it. ...Shikamaru's dressed like he did in all of Shippuden, too, I guess)</p>\n<p>(Sidenote: Yay! I figured out the spacing issue I had in the last chapter, if you guys noticed it. Also for some reason, AO3 adds spaces after all my italics, but only after I've gone over everything and then hit 'preview', so then I have to go back and redo them all for some bizarre reason. First world perfectionist problems, man.)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>\"This thing of being a hero, about the main thing to it is to know when to die.\" - Will Rogers</p>\n<p>So this is the end of the story. I hope it wasn't too abrupt - I did the best I could. Honestly, I wasn't expecting the response I got, and your comments inspired me to expand a bit from what had been just a two-shot story. Originally, Team 7 was going to have only two scenes from their POV! I also was going to write a multi-POV epilogue, but then Obito's POV stole the show and now it's four chapters long, going on five. Whoops. Anyway, I dearly hope you'll all forgive me for the bittersweet ending - but try to keep this in mind:</p>\n<p>The only people this story ended sadly for are the ones who were never meant to be in this world in the first place. </p>\n<p>Sometimes that's the price of change. Sometimes the greatest heroes die with no ever knowing what fate they saved them from to begin with.</p>\n<p>(EDIT: It's 2022 and I still get comments correcting me that that Bloody Mist only became such *after* Obito mind controlled Yagura. That's wrong, it canonically became known as the Bloody Mist when Zabuza graduated the academy at age 9, the same year Obito also graduated from Konoha academy, at the same age. It was the Bloody Mist long before Obito was 'rescued' by Madara.</p>\n<p>There are plot holes in my story, it was the first story I ever completed, and there are things I would write differently if I rewrote this story today. But I wrote this story six years ago at this point. It's not perfect, but I'm leaving it as it is. Thank you for all the wonderful comments, I still read each and every one!)</p>",
    "text": "Rin stares up at the rocks above her, her head spinning horribly.  Captured,  she thinks miserably.  Again, and the thought causes her pain, because last time it had cost Obito his life. Her skin itches, and something cold and wet running down her thigh has her snapping her eyes open in alarm, heart leaping to her throat. She\u2019s  naked, straight up  naked, and her fear only deepens by the sight of black lines painted into her skin, dried and old, with a shinobi crouching at her legs and painting fresh ones down it.\n\u201cOh! She\u2019s awake.\u201d Another shinobi says and Rin, cover already blown before she could  think  to keep it, lifts her head. The large cave is  filled  with shinobi - Kiri, from the looks, and some of them seem to be their ANBU equivalent. \u201cGood morning, sunshine.\u201d The shinobi mocks, stepping up to her feet and staring down at her through a mask. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart,\u201d He adds with a pointed look  down  that has the blood rushing from her face. \u201cYou aren\u2019t here for that. No, it\u2019s even  better.\u201d\nRin can\u2019t help but cringe, trying to lean away, trying to curl up to shield her  assets, but she can\u2019t move anything but her head. Her fear hits an entirely new level, almost choking in it\u2019s intensity.\n\u201cShut up, Namishi.\u201d The one painting, now down her foot, hisses irritably. \u201cBrag and bluster when it\u2019s done. It\u2019ll be easier when she doesn\u2019t know what to fight.\u201d\n\u201cHmph. Or maybe you just don\u2019t have the stomach for this.\u201d The masked one, Namishi, snorts before turning on his heel. He heads for what looks like might have once been the mouth of the cave but has since been collapsed, hands in his pockets.\nOnly for the wall of rubble to suddenly shatter, raining rubble down on the ANBU and the other shinobi unfortunate enough to be near him. \u201cWhat-\u201d The man painting her lurches away in alarm as a pink-haired woman darts into the cave and pauses just long enough to look at them with big, innocent eyes that send chills down Rin\u2019s spine.\n\u201cOops. Am I interrupting something?\u201d She asks sweetly, drawing a katana from her back.\nFor a moment, all Rin can see is the crimson streak left behind from the blade as the woman darts through the cave.  She\u2019s almost as fast as sensei,  Rin thinks dizzyingly as blood - an incredible amount of blood - flies through the air with every death.\nIt takes  seconds.\nAll she can think about is that they were  ANBU, and it took  seconds. The mysterious, pink-haired woman pauses when the last one drops, finally going still long enough for Rin to actually  see  her.\nHer hair is short and loose, and it\u2019s a soft, cotton pink where the bloodspray isn\u2019t staining it red. It\u2019s almost laughable - though maybe that\u2019s the terror trying to bubble out of her - how  gentle  a color it is. She wears a sleeveless, high-collared, qipao-esque dress that\u2019s a deep, crimson color, dark enough to barely show the blood spattering it. It stops just short of her bellybutton, veering around to stretch down to her knees in the back. She has white pants on under that, mid-calf length, and black  high heels, of all things.\nThe woman sighs and crouches down over the nearest body, reaching out with black gloved hands to grab their pant leg - which she then uses to wipe off her sword.\nHer dark red sword, dark enough that it doesn\u2019t look very different without the blood on it, that leaves a faint streak with every motion.\n Chakra blade,  Rin realizes, stunned.\nWho in the world is this mystery woman?\nChakra blades are  rare, incredibly expensive, and  stunningly  difficult to imbue with a chakra-type. Kakashi\u2019s white one had been imbued over two lifetimes with lightning-type chakra, giving it the white coloring it had. If she had to guess, she\u2019d have to assume the mystery woman\u2019s was imbued with fire-type, giving it the red coloring.\nBut her confused thoughts stutter to a sudden stop when the woman stands back up and turns to walk towards her. \u201cHey, there.\u201d She greets, and the smile she flashes Rin is warm but it\u2019s not at all reassuring, especially not with her next words. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll be home when you wake up.\u201d\nBefore Rin can do more than flinch with wide, frightened eyes, the woman reaches out with a bloody, leather-gloved hand and presses it to her forehead.\nNauseatingly intense drowsiness hits her with the force of a chakra-punch to the face, and her eyes roll back all on their own.\n\u201cWe\u2019re clear.\u201d She hears the woman say, her voice losing all warmth and replacing it with frigid hardness.\nShe\u2019s unconscious an instant later, unable to fight it any longer.\n\u00a0\nWhen she wakes up, it\u2019s in one of the large jutsu rooms in the hospital basement, Minato studiously painting seals all around her while Kushina carefully examines her chest.\nRin can\u2019t quite help the soft hitch in her breathing, confusion quickly transforming into alarm, and Kushina\u2019s head snaps up to look at her face. \u201cHey, hey, calm down.\u201d Kushina says quickly, which makes Minato whip around, and  oh god.\nShe\u2019s still naked. Someone had draped a thin cloth over her breasts and hips, but she\u2019s still naked, and on top of the natural alarm and disgust at that, now Minato\u2019s  right there. Shame rushes through her, mixing with the terrified confusion gripping her, and nothing in the world could stop her eyes from tearing up.\nEven so, Kushina instantly dabs a cloth at the corners of her eyes, allowing none of the tears to escape them. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Rin.\u201d She says, and it\u2019s not a comforting tone of voice but a firm, grim command.\n\u201cYou\u2019re covered in seals, Rin.\u201d Minato adds, very carefully kneeling at her other side, and the expression on his face is almost worse than what she\u2019s already feeling.\nIt\u2019s the same expression he\u2019d worn when Obito died. Grim and tense with grief and anger all rolled into one.\nBut why? Why did he have reason to  grieve? Had something happened?\nShe swallows thickly and belatedly tries to speak. \u201cHow\u2026?\u201d She manages to force out, but god, it\u2019s hard to speak. She\u2019s not entirely sure why, but she can only assume it as to do with the fact that she can't control her breathing for some reason.\n\u201cKakashi brought you back, Rin.\u201d Minato explains and Kushina makes a soft noise in the back of her throat before she shifts back again, leaning down to intently examine Rin\u2019s stomach. \u201cYou were taken by Kiri. Do you remember that?\u201d He asks, and with effort, she\u2019s able to carefully nod once. \u201cGreat. They put a few seals on you that we\u2019re working to get off, alright?\u201d Minato says quietly and she grimaces deeply at that. \u201cOne of them\u2019s a paralysis seal. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t move.\u201d\u201cStolen right out of Uzushio, too.\u201d Kushina adds darkly. \u201cI\u2019ll have it off in no time, Rin, don\u2019t worry.\u201d She says, but any attempt at reassurance is ruined by the way she and Minato exchange quick, grim looks at that.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Rin asks tightly and Minato\u2019s frown deepens a little.\n\u201cThere was another seal on you, Rin.\u201d Minato explains slowly. \u201cOn your heart.\u201d\nWhich\u2026 how? Rin tries to ask it with her eyes and Minato sighs heavily.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how it was there, or how it was removed, but whatever it was, it was\u2026 a very nasty curse seal, Rin. Whatever it was, it was powerful enough to leave chakra traces all over you. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t cry right now. We can\u2019t tamper with any of the seals from that fuinjutsu until the chakra\u2019s gone, and it\u2019s hard to figure what seals went with what jutsu.\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019m ready.\u201d Kushina says suddenly, interrupting Minato, and the blonde pauses to look at her. \u201cShould only take a moment to remove it - and painlessly, to boot.\u201d Kushina elaborates reassuringly, and Rin offers her a weak smile until Minato looks back down at her.\n\u201cDon\u2019t move, Rin, even after it\u2019s gone. You can\u2019t smudge these seals - we don\u2019t know what it\u2019ll let that leftover chakra do.\u201d Minato instructs sternly, and all she can do is nod at that.\n\u201cAlright. This\u2019ll itch -  don\u2019t scratch.\u201d Kushina warns.\nBefore she can even consider reacting, there\u2019s a flare of chakra and her stomach tingles  maddeningly.\nIt lasts only a moment before warmth spreads across her chest and suddenly she can  breathe. \u201cOh thank god,\u201d Rin exhales before she can help herself and Kushina flashes a quick grin.\n\u201cI also go by Kushina.\u201d She jokes.\nMinato\u2019s lips give a faint twitch before he clears his throat and the slight lightness of the mood crashes down again. \u201cI need you to tell me everything you remember, Rin.\u201d\nHe\u2019s kind enough to give her a moment to think. Kushina steps back, examining and then slowly painting more seals on the floor around her, and Minato quietly watches her while Rin gathers her thoughts.\nShe orders them as best as she can, and then starts to speak. \u201cI was taken out of the camp. I don\u2019t remember how - I only woke up once, and it was after I was taken. They were quick to knock me back out. When I woke up again, I was in a cave - a big one, and they\u2019d collapsed the opening to it.\u201d Rin recalls as steadily as she can. \u201cI was\u2026 they\u2019d stripped me, and one of them was painting seals down my legs. Another one of them mocked me, saying something about it being worse than whatever I was imagining. The one painting the seals told him to shut up, that \u2018it\u2019 would be easier if I didn\u2019t know what to fight.\u201d Rin explains slowly, shaking her head helplessly at Minato\u2019s questioning expression. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they meant. Almost immediately after that\u2026\u201d She pauses, brow furrowing.\nIt didn\u2019t seem real, to be honest. It had been so quick and so\u2026 bizarre. \u201cThere was a woman. She blew the cave entrance open again and crushed several with the rubble. She had a sword, sensei.\u201d Rin adds quickly, because that was definitely a defining feature. \u201cI think it was a chakra blade, because it was dark red and left streaks behind like Kakashi\u2019s white one did.\u201dHis brow furrows at this, lips twisting down grimly, but he doesn\u2019t say anything so she sweeps on.\n\u201cShe killed them. All of them. They were ANBU, but she took them out in  seconds, sensei. She was almost as fast as you. There had to be at least twenty ANBU in there, but they were dead in seconds.\u201d Rin recalls, shaking her head incredulously. \u201cAnd then she just walked over to me when it was done. She said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be home when you wake up\u2019, and then put her hand on my forehead.\u201d Rin pauses, swallowing at the rush of anxiety hitting her. All she\u2019d done was  touch  her and she was out, completely helpless. Who knew what the mystery woman had done to her? \u201cThen I woke up here.\u201d\nFor a very long moment, Minato stares at her in tense silence, his eyes narrowed in consideration.\n\u201c...She had pink hair.\u201d Rin remembers belatedly, frowning softly. \u201cBubble-gum pink. Short hair, down to her chin - and I don\u2019t think she was alone. I remember\u2026\u201d Rin says softly, trying to recall the exact words. \u201cI remember she said \u2018we\u2019re clear\u2019, right before I passed out.\u201d\nAnother long silence, and then Minato expels a heavy breath. \u201cI see. Thank you, Rin, this\u2019ll help us.\u201d He says, but the dangerous, dark look he exchanges with Kushina makes her doubt his truthfulness. Minato shakes his head once and then pushes to his feet, picking back up the brush he\u2019d discarded some time ago. \u201cRight. Let\u2019s get that chakra out of you, hm?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nObito could honestly say he was  not  expecting the massive boulder blocking the entrance of the cave to suddenly explode.\nIn fact, it was the very last thing he expected to happen.\nFollowed immediately by the single most confusing, terrifying, and downright  weird  experience of his entire life - and that included the experience that put him in this cave to begin with.\nThe boulder explodes, and two streaks of light - one a smooth red, the other a jumping blue - rush through the flying rubble and dust, and before Obito can do more than widen his eyes, the red streak hits Guruguru and turns him into a disgusting, gooey splatter on the distant wall. \u201c...Ew.\u201d A woman\u2019s voice says emphatically, and Obito turns his head to see the blue streak standing over Madara\u2019s sitting form, a lightning-charged sword held to his throat.\n\u201cWhat-\u201d Obito starts to ask, breathless and gasping because  what the fuck just happened, and promptly shuts up when the red-streak turns towards him.\nShe\u2019s not red. Her dress is red, and there\u2019s an alarming amount of blood-red color splattered in her bubblegum pink hair - but the streak comes from her dark red sword, which is suddenly held in an inch from his eyes. \u201cHello.\u201d The woman greets with a smile.\nHe doesn\u2019t move. He barely even breathes, and it takes all his willpower to not look cross-eyed at the sword between his eyes.\nMadara is dead silent, and whoever the woman\u2019s companion is is equally so.\nHe can\u2019t help it. \u201cWhat?\u201d Obito manages to whimper, confused and more than a little bit completely terrified, and the woman tilts her head a little, smiling even warmer.\nIt is quite possibly the scariest thing he\u2019s ever seen, and he thought Madara was a real shinigami not too\u00a0long ago.\n\u201cNo need to worry, Obito-chan.\u201d The woman chirps just as warmly as her smile.\n Oh my god she\u2019s a psychopath,  Obito realizes. \u201cHow do you-\u201dThe blade twitches, turning ever so slightly, and Obito shuts up again.\n\u201cGood boy.\u201d The woman approves.\nHe\u2019d be more offended if he wasn\u2019t so afraid of breathing.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not here.\u201d The mystery man says suddenly, dark and angry, and the woman hums lightly, her smile fading.\n\u201cAny sign?\u201d\u201cNot a damn thing.\u201d The man growls.\nThe woman frowns, her bright green eyes suddenly even more deadly, and she lightly taps Obito\u2019s cheek with the flat of her sword tip.\nHe blinks violently, but doesn\u2019t flinch, afraid for his face. And life in general, really.\n\u201cDon\u2019t. Move.\u201d The woman instructs, slow and firm, and then she whips around.\nHe tries to slump the moment her back is turned, relief almost crippling him, but he actually  can\u2019t  move. He physically can\u2019t move at all other than to breathe and blink, frozen with his bad arm lifting him halfway up onto his elbow.\nThe very brief moment of relief is completely ruined by the terror slamming into him at full force again.  What\u2019s happening?  Obito wonders, desperately trying to at least  twitch, but nothing. Not a damn thing.\nHe watches the mystery woman walk up and stop next to the man, who Obito can now see has spiked, black hair, though his body is hidden by a heavy, shapeless cloak. The only part of him visible is the side of his face and the arm extended, holding his lightning-sparking blade to Madara\u2019s neck. Madara, whose skin is pale and his breathing even raspier than usual. He actually\u2026 he actually looks  afraid, Obito realizes with a horrified, sick kind of awe.\nWhat the hell had the man done to make Madara look like  that?\n\u201cThat\u2019s very unfortunate for you, Madara-sama.\u201d The woman says calmly, sheathing her sword over her shoulder. She leans forward then, resting her hands on her knees and leaning until they\u2019re at eye level. \u201cThat would have been your only chance at redemption. Tell me, have you realized yet? Just how\u2026  deluded  you are?\u201d\n\u201cNot very likely.\u201d The man drawls before Madara could possibly answer.  Then  they pause for a response, of which does not come. \u201cI told you so.\u201d\u201cSo you did.\u201d The woman agrees mildly. \u201cFine. If he doesn\u2019t even know, then I don\u2019t care. Do what you want, but leave his face alone.\u201d The woman says as she straightens up and turns back around towards Obito. She pauses only long enough to pass a scroll to the man before she heads towards Obito, stopping when she\u2019s right in front of him.\nHe can\u2019t see anything around her, but he  hears  the wet, slick slice of a blade through flesh and bone, and salty saliva pools into his mouth.  Don\u2019t throw up, don\u2019t throw up, don\u2019t throw up.  Obito tells himself firmly, because he doesn't even want to think about\u00a0what that would lead to when he can\u2019t even  open his mouth.\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to wipe the sword off.\u201d The woman says distractedly, reaching out to put her hand against Obito\u2019s chest. He cringes, nausea only growing, at the sensation of her chakra invading his system. It\u2019s a soothing sensation, but he doesn\u2019t  like it, because who knows what she\u2019s doing? Or planning to do? \u201cWe don\u2019t know what he has in him.\u201d\u201cTch. Easier for me to just use your sword, then.\u201d The man scoffs from across the cave and the woman rolls her eyes, then reaches up and cups Obito\u2019s face.\nHis breathing stills as her fingers gently but firmly prod all along his face, a small, thoughtful frown tugging at her red-painted lips. Then she lightly thumbs his upper eyelids and pushes them up. Obito really  cringes then, knowing she\u2019s staring into an empty socket on his left side. He hasn\u2019t seen it himself - now that\u2019d really be puke worthy - but it can\u2019t possibly  not  be disgusting. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing Naruto isn\u2019t here.\u201d She mutters, nose wrinkling, before releasing her grip on his eyelids. \u201cHe\u2019d probably go around restoring things without thinking them through, and then we\u2019d really have to kill you.\u201d\n What.\nObito\u2019s brain stalls for a second.\nSure, it was terrifying having her loom all dangerous and psychopathic over him, but for her to  outright say that  is an unwelcome kind of shock. Something clearly shows on his face because she lightly pats his cheek before pulling her hands back. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Obito-chan. I\u2019m a medic.\u201d She says, and smiles warmly again - but this time with a hint of genuine gentleness that actually does put him a little bit at ease.\nAt least until she steps to the side and the man stabs him through the chest.\nFor a moment, all he can do is stare wide eyed at the lightning dancing up the blade, a horrible, sickening sensation spreading through his chest.\nAnd then he\u2019s gone.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe wakes up in a clearing in the trees, the pink-haired woman sitting casually a few feet away. \u201cOh my god,\u201d Obito gasps in a breath he  shouldn\u2019t be able to take, sitting up and scooting frantically away from her. He doesn\u2019t stop until his back hits a tree trunk, and then then he only pauses when he realizes that to get around it, he\u2019d have to turn his back to her.\n Then  he slumps, his heart hammering against his ribs, and stares at her with one wide, terrified eye.\nShe smiles sadly at him, genuine and so much less terrifying than before, but still pretty damn scary because she  murdered him.\n\u201cHow- How am-\u201d\n\u201cMedic-nin.\u201d The woman offers apologetically, waving a hand vaguely. \u201cI healed you. We didn\u2019t want you dead.\u201d The woman says, her smile dying away, and the hard, contemplative way she looks at him is almost more frightening than her earlier smiles. \u201cTell me, Obito-chan. Did you choose to stay with that withered old monster?\u201d She asks in a perfectly controlled voice.\nShe doesn\u2019t even have to  do anything, and he\u2019s completely terrified by her presence.\n\u201cNo!\u201d It\u2019s both humbling and shaming to be so afraid of her so easily, and Obito has to take a moment to just  breathe  before he can try speaking further. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t- I can\u2019t walk. Not far.\u201d He explains shakily, taking a ragged breath and trying to at  least  steady his voice. \u201cMy\u2026 my leg. It\u2019s messed up.\u201dWhich was an understatement, but \u2018crushed by a boulder with most of the thigh replaced by creepy monster flesh\u2019 was a much longer story to tell. He sure wasn\u2019t going to tell  her,  anyways.\n\u201cHmph. Well, lucky for you, then, kid.\u201d The woman hums, rising to her feet, and  oh god,  his blood pressure rises with her. She walks slowly towards him, and it takes  everything he has  not to turn and run like a complete, miserable coward. She crouches once she\u2019s reached him, extending a hand, and Obito blinks stupidly at the scroll held in it. \u201cThis is for your Hokage, Obito-chan. Tell him it\u2019s a gift, free of charge.\u201d The woman says, and there\u2019s that goddamned smile again, sending chills down his spine. She sets it on his chest, his hands clenched into fists at his side, and holds the scroll there with a fingertip.\n\u201cTell him we appreciate the delicacy of the situation.\u201d The woman instructs slowly. \u201cAnd then tell him to stay out of our way.\u201d The woman adds, her smile going away. It isn\u2019t replaced by anything more terrifying, but her emerald green eyes  burn  with the intensity of the stare she locks on him. All he can do is hold her gaze and hope he doesn\u2019t look at pathetically weak as he feels. \u201cWe have a purpose. We will not be stopped.\u201d She says in that silky, deadly calm tone he\u2019s only ever heard Orochimaru use as effectively as she does.\nThen she lets go of the scroll, which drops into his lap, and rises to her feet. She pauses to brush off her knees, then frowns down at him. \u201cThough with any luck, we won\u2019t have any reason to return to the Land of Fire anyways. Konoha\u2019s a kilometer that way - the path is only about a hundred and thirty yards  that  way,\u201d The woman says, gesturing to each direction. \u201cI suggest you pick the path. Good luck, Obito-chan - I\u2019ll be very irritated if you don\u2019t get home safe.\u201d\nAnd before he can decipher  that  bizarre new personality twist, she turns and vanishes with a quick\u00a0shunshin.\nHe scrambles to his feet. It hurts, pain lancing up his thigh at the sudden movement and pressure, but he ignores it. He ignores it, and Obito limps as fast and as far the fuck away from the trees as he can get.\nIt takes almost ten minutes to go a hundred and thirty yards. It\u2019s  miserable, and Obito manages to feel all the more pathetic by the end of it, even if he is a little bit proud to have made it.\nOf course, by \u2018made it\u2019, he means that he pretty much faceplants on the path and tries not to breathe in too much dirt. And then he valiantly passes out.\nHe wakes up to hands on his shoulders, and his instinctive reaction is to flinch away with a sharp, breathless gasp. The hands abruptly go still and his eye flies open to see two shinobi he doesn\u2019t recognize leaning over him, and Obito wants to cry at the sight of the familiar hitai-ates on their foreheads. \u201cDon\u2019t touch my arm.\u201d Obito begs them, shaky and rough, because that would be the last damned straw. Tugging it too much was still capable of yanking the damn thing off, and now he couldn\u2019t-\nHe couldn\u2019t  replace it.\n\u201cShit, kid.\u201d The one gripping his shoulders murmurs, grimacing, and shifts his hand away from Obito\u2019s right shoulder. \u201cGot a name, there?\u201d\nObito closes his eye for a moment, taking a deep, steadying breath, and it\u2019s so much easier now that Crazy McPinkhair is gone. When he opens his eye again, it\u2019s with his Sharingan burning, and the man tenses a little in surprise. \u201cObito Uchiha. I\u2019ve been held captive.\u201d He forces out as steadily as he can, then lifts up the scroll the woman had dropped on him. \u201cFor the Hokage,\u201d he adds tiredly, and the shinobi looks up at his partner with a grimace.\n\u201cRight. Let\u2019s go, then.\u201d He says, shifting his hand under Obito\u2019s knees and lifting him up. He\u2019s too tired to be indignant about it, and a moment later the shinobi\u2019s shifting him onto his partner\u2019s back in a much more dignifying position. Obito can\u2019t help but slump in utter relief.\nHe can\u2019t help the way his eye burns with tears, relief and grief hitting him in equal, overwhelming amounts. All he can do is close his eye and rest his forehead against the shinobi\u2019s shoulder, the familiar texture of the flak vest driving the point further.\nHe\u2019s going home. He\u2019s really going  home.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKonoha is quiet, and in a very bad way. The kind that makes you think,  it\u2019s too quiet. Something terrible is happening. \nIn reality, though few people would ever realize it, something  great  is happening.\nDeep down in his evil little lair of a home, Danzo Shimura\u2019s head is being chopped off.\nNo one comes to save him. Not even his little brainwashed servant children, as they\u2019re all mysteriously unconscious in the hallways. They\u2019ll wake up with no memory of how they even got where they were, much less what took them all out. They\u2019ll wake up, and they\u2019ll finally sound the alarm, but it\u2019ll be far, far too late.\nBy then, Danzo\u2019s body will be a fried, twitching body on the floor, and his head will be perched on his own sword, sticking up out of his desk like a pike.\nAnd stuck to his forehead will be a small note reading,\n\n \u2018If you want to know why I did this, take a look into his memories.\u2019 \n\n(Three days later, Inoichi Yamanaka will stumble out of the autopsy room and vomit. Hiruzen Sarutobi will bow his head and wonder how he can still be so naive after a life as violent as he\u2019s lived. No one will be able to say for sure who took out Danzo, but those very few who are in the know will be grateful for the mystery murderer.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nObito wakes up in a hospital bed, which means two things.\nOne, someone used a jutsu on him, because there\u2019s no way he slept through all that movement and also having his  clothes changed.\nTwo, he\u2019s not waking in T&amp;I, so he figures they did something to determine that he is, in fact, that dead guy he was claiming to be.\nHe\u2019s relieved at both things, because again: not in T&amp;I, always something to be relieved about, and because  thank god, real clothing, and a real bed! With real sheets! And a real blanket!\nObito runs his fingers down the fabric, unable to quite contain his awe. His right arm is still attached, too, and an experimental wiggle of his toes confirms his leg is in good order as well.  Awesome. He lifts his head a little to take a look at the room, and nearly swallows his tongue he flinches so hard.\nMinato, lurking in the corner of the room, immediately looks stricken. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Obito, it\u2019s just me.\u201d he says quickly but  soothingly, and it makes Obito hiss his breath out through his teeth.\n When did I become such a damned coward, he can\u2019t help but wonder bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Obito says immediately, mostly to get that look off Minato\u2019s face, but his sensei only looks more guilty before he glances grimly down at the floor. Obito watches him for a moment, taking in the exhausted way the man holds his shoulders, the guilty way he frowns at the floor, and the overall mood of\u2026 severity he exudes. \u201cHere to interrogate me?\u201d Obito asks quietly, and he\u2019s far more exhausted than he could ever be bitter - but it still makes Minato grimace deeper.\nStill, the man swallows hard and straightens up, sighing heavily. \u201cYeah. Yeah, I am.\u201d Minato admits, his guilt draining away and replaced by grim resignation. He doesn\u2019t move closer, though, and Obito\u2026\nObito\u2019s shamefully relieved by that.He doesn\u2019t fully understand why. He was so happy at the idea of coming home, of seeing everyone again, and even now he desperately wants to hug the man - but not as desperately as he wants to put more distance between them. The room\u2019s space isn\u2019t enough - especially not with Minato subtly blocking his path to the door, making the fluttery, trapped sensation in Obito\u2019s chest even worse.\nObito\u2019s-...\nHe reaches up tentatively, his hand shaking, and very carefully presses down on his chest.\n Nothing. Not a damn thing, not even the over sensitivity of freshly healed wounds. \u201cThey stabbed me.\u201d He says incredulously, and Minato\u2019s head snaps up at that.\n\u201cWho-\u201d he starts, then cuts himself off and takes a deep breath. \u201cAlright.\u201d Minato says sternly enough that Obito\u2019s attention automatically returns to the man, even as he fists the front of his gown and rubs his knuckles into the confusingly  normal  feeling flesh. \u201cStart from the beginning, Obito.\u201d Minato instructs, folding his arms across his chest and leaning against the wall.\nEven with the distance, he feels uncomfortably  pressured, and he takes a moment to swallow thickly before he tries to speak. \u201cHe had servants.\u201d Obito starts hoarsely, closing his eye and trying to figure out how to even describe the Zetsus. \u201cOne of them pulled me from the rubble and took me to him. They\u2019re\u2026 made out of Hashirama cells. The same thing my-\u201d Obito chokes off, taking another breath before he tries again. \u201cThe same thing he replaced my arm and- and my right side with. I couldn\u2019t leave. I tried. He- he cut off part of my leg, so I couldn\u2019t walk, so I- I tried to drag myself, but he blocked off the cave entrance.\u201d\nIt hadn\u2019t seemed so bad at the time. The initial rush of fear, the helplessness, that had been awful - but after those first couple of weeks, things hadn\u2019t\u2026  seemed  so bad. But now, now that he\u2019s speaking about it in the safety of Konoha, under Minato\u2019s protective watch, it seems so much worse.\nHe was  safe  here, he was  comfortable here, and that was making it all the more clear to him just how unsafe he\u2019d been in that cave. Just how much of a prisoner he\u2019d well and truly been.\nIt\u2019s not a pleasant realization. It takes him time and effort to get through his tale of his time spent there, with multiple pauses to just  breathe. But Minato doesn\u2019t push him, doesn\u2019t speak at  all  as Obito details his\u2026 imprisonment.\n\u201cHow did you get free?\u201d Minato asks him at the end of his tale, and Obito lifts a hand to rub at his aching eye.\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to describe it. It came out of nowhere. We were.. It was all quiet. The Zetsus, they kept an eye on everything, but there was no warning. They must\u2019ve killed them.\u201d Obito realizes aloud, pausing, and once more Minato\u2019s silent as he lets Obito gather his thoughts. \u201cI was laying down. I\u2019d already walked across the cave three times. The boulder, it just exploded. There was- they were so fast, all I could see was the streaks they left behind. One of them, a woman, took out the Zetsu watching me before the rubble even hit the ground - and the other went for Madara.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what he did to him. I didn\u2019t hear anything at all, but the woman, she- she knew who I was. She blocked my sight of Madara and held a sword between my eyes and she said my name.\u201d Obito says slowly, lowering his hand and opening his eye to stare at it unseeingly. How had she known his name, and how had he not noticed before hand?\nOh, right.\nThe terror. He almost forgot about that.\n\u201cShe had a bright red sword. It left streaks behind, like Kakashi\u2019s White Fang. She tapped me with it and told me to stay still, and I couldn\u2019t move at all. I could blink, but that was it.\u201d Obito recalls incredulously. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she did it. The man with her, somehow he scared the  hell  out of Madara. I couldn\u2019t see much of him - he wore a black cloak, but he had black, spiky hair, and used a sword-\u201d Oh, God.\nUsed a sword that was probably going to haunt Obito\u2019s dreams for the  rest of his damn life.\n\u201cHe used a sword, too, but it didn\u2019t shimmer like hers did. He- he pushed lightning chakra across-\u201d Obito chokes off, and it\u2019s a lucky thing Minato\u2019s so fast, because otherwise he\u2019d puke all over his own pillow instead of into a teleporting emesis basin.\n\u201cStop, Obito.\u201d Minato says tiredly, but Obito shakes his head, spitting out foul saliva into the basin, which disappears a moment later - and then Minato\u2019s at the foot of his bed, lips pressed hard together.\n\u201cI can do this.\u201d Obito protests, setting his jaw, and Minato grimaces.\n\u201cI know you can, but is it worth it to force it now?\u201d Minato points out quietly.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Obito snaps without hesitation, because if he does it  now, he won\u2019t have to talk about it  late\u00a0. \u201cHe used lightning chakra down the length of the sword. He- I don\u2019t understand the conversation, but he and the woman, they demanded to know about someone, a \u2018him\u2019, but I don\u2019t know who. It was only me and the Zetsus ever in the cave.\u201d He explains, shaking his head. \u201cShe was pissed. She mocked him for being deluded, then told the man to do what he wanted. She walked back over to me and I couldn\u2019t see them anymore but- but she passed him a scroll, and I  know  what I heard,\u201d Obito says, and it\u2019s suddenly hard to breathe. He looks up at Minato helplessly, deeply upset without understanding  why. Surely he didn\u2019t  mourn  the man? \u201cMadara\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t he? They killed him?\u201d He asks tightly.\nMinato\u2019s lips press even harder together. Then he nods a slow, damning nod.\nIt hurts.\nHe doesn\u2019t know why, but it hurts. He\u2019s\u2026 he  grieves  for the old, psychopathic bastard, and that\u2019s more upsetting than the actual grief itself. \u201cHis  head  was in the scroll?\u201d Obito chokes out.\nMinato reaches out to set a hand on Obito\u2019s foot, and  god damn it, he can\u2019t help but flinch away, jerking his leg up. All he can do is stare, wide-eyed and apologetic at the horrified face Minato makes for a split second. Then he goes carefully blank-faced again and takes a step back. \u201cWait. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Obito says urgently, sitting up to reach for the man, and  wow  is that a mistake. His head spins  violently  and his chest twinges, and he suddenly finds himself staring up at the ceiling again, dizzy.\nIt feels like chakra exhaustion, which makes no sense  at all.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll finish up tomorrow, Obito. Rest.\u201d Minato says quietly.\nIt\u2019s a statement to how good of an idea that is that Obito can\u2019t even protest. All he can do is obediently close his eye again, and he\u2019s asleep before the world can manage to stop spinning sickeningly around him.\n\u00a0\nThe next day he feels\u2026 worse.\nSort of.\nLike all the energy in the world has been sucked away.\nIt makes Minato watch him uncomfortably intently, and he brings a Yamanaka with him, too. He lurks in the corner,  really  lurks, not like Minato-lurk, and it both makes it easier to ignore him and impossible to outright  forget  he\u2019s there.\n\u201cStart from where you left off. You heard the man kill Madara and the woman was in front of you.\u201d Minato instructs softly.\nObito doesn\u2019t close his eye this time, because it makes it too easy to picture the memories. Instead he stares intently at his hands, his right arm carefully bandaged from shoulder to fingertip. \u201cShe grabbed me. Started feeling my chest and face, I don\u2019t know why. She - she peeled my right eye open and-\u201d Obito pauses for a split second, remembering the weirdness she\u2019d said after that. \u201cShe said, \u2018It\u2019s a good thing Naruto isn\u2019t here\u2019.\u201d Obito recites slowly, trying to remember it word for word, and he doesn\u2019t notice the way Minato stiffens at the name. \u201cShe said something really weird. \u2018He\u2019d go around\u2026 restoring everything\u2019?\u201d Obito tests the words and then nods when they sound right.\n\u201cYeah. \u2018He\u2019d go around restoring everything, and then we\u2019d really have to kill you\u2019.\u201d He  does  notice Minato tensing at this part, his eyes narrowing slightly with what was probably straight up rage instead of mild irritation, knowing how contained his sensei was. Is? Still is, apparently. \u201cAnd then she\u2026\u201d Obito pauses, taking a slightly-too-ragged breath, and tries again. \u201cShe said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m a medic\u2019, then stepped- stepped to the side and-\u201d\n Damn  it. Obito lifts his good hand up to rub at his eye, taking slow breaths. He figures he must be doing a good enough job staying on the right side of a mental breakdown, because the Yamanaka doesn\u2019t come running at him or anything. \u201cThe man stabbed me in the heart.\u201d Obito says in a flat rush, forcedly calm.\nThere\u2019s a moment of silence and a faint tickle of killing intent. \u201cWhat?\u201d Minato asks slowly.\n\u201cYeah. Lightning sword. I don\u2019t- I woke up in the forest and she was the only one with me. Said she healed me.\u201d Obito says quickly, hurrying onto less panic-inducing memories. \u201cShe demanded to know if I stayed with Madara intentionally.\u201d Obito adds, shaking his head helplessly. \u201cI said no. I\u2019m pretty sure if I said yes, she would\u2019ve killed me for real - but I  didn\u2019t  stay with him willingly, and she believed me. Then she gave me that scroll and told me to tell the Hokage that\u2026 it was a gift, \u2018free of charge\u2019. That they \u2018understood the delicacy of the situation\u2019, and to, and I\u2019m quoting here, \u2018Stay out of our way\u2019. That they have a purpose, and won\u2019t be stopped.\u201d Obito trails off, lowering his hand and looking up at Minato apologetically.\n\u201cThen she pointed me to the path and left. I don\u2019t know where she- Wait. She  did  say they weren\u2019t planning on returning to the Land of Fire.\u201d He remembers suddenly, frowning at Minato.\nWho frowns darkly back, his arms folded and gripping the opposite biceps. \u201cDescribe her to me.\u201d Minato instructs after a long pause.\n\u201cShort pink hair, about chin length. Had a lot of blood-splattered on her. She wore a red dress, dark and it stopped at her belly button in the front, but went down to her knees in the back. White pants underneath.\u201d Obito recites off quickly, his brow furrowing in concentration. \u201cShe wore high heels. The special, kunoichi-issue kind. Black, but no hitai-ate at all. Not even a plateless one. Green eyes, kind of emerald. I didn\u2019t see much of the man. I only saw he had black hair.\u201d He trails off there, having no more real information to offer.\nMinato\u2019s silent for a long, considering moment, and then he sighs softly. \u201cAlright. Tell me more about these \u2018White Zetsus'.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cKiller B and Yugito Nii have gone missing.\u201d Sarutobi informs Minato, two weeks after Obito\u2019s return.\nIt says a lot about the month that all Minato can do is sit down and rub his hands over his face. \u201cHow?\u201d He asks eventually, muffled by his palms, and Sarutobi sighs heavily.\n\u201cYugito Nii was last seen in open combat with a pink-haired woman with an unusual red sword.\u201d Sarutobi says grimly, confirming his fears. The damned woman,  again. \u201cAnd Killer B was last seen running away from Kumogakure with a blonde haired man in an orange jumpsuit and a red haori, and a black-haired man whose features were concealed by a cloak.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s more of them?\u201d Minato croaks, not yet willing to pull his hands off his face.\nGod, he really needs some sleep.\n\u201cIt certainly appears so. Reports imply Killer B went along willingly. Yugito Nii, not as much.\u201dHe lowers his hands, meeting Sarutobi\u2019s grim stare. \u201cShe was able to subdue her?\u201d\u201cReports indicate that after a short battle, Yugito appeared to be \u2018controlled\u2019 and forced to leave with our mystery woman.\u201d Sarutobi explains, then pauses to inhale around his pipe. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to assume that there are three of them, and she is their leader.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s a child, but Nii is no pushover. I\u2019ve read reports of the skirmishes she\u2019s been in - she\u2019s brutal, and she has complete control of her bijuu. Killer B even more so.\u201d Minato shakes his head, resisting the urge to throw his arms up over his head. \u201cWhat in the world do they  want? It can\u2019t be the bijuu. Killer B would never have gone willingly if that was their goal.\u201d\n\u201cAssuming that he was willing, and her companions did not employ the same assumed jutsu that the woman used on Yugito Nii.\u201d Sarutobi acknowledges with a deep frown.\n\u201cWhat are the chances of that? It\u2019s likely a kekkei genkai, from the way Obito described it. All she had to do was touch him.\u201d Minato points out, lifting a hand to rub at his chin. \u201cIf they  are  after the bijuu, they have three so far.\u201d He says, then pauses. \u201cThe woman told Obito they weren\u2019t planning on returning to the Land of Fire. A ploy to get our guard down so they can try to get Kushina?\u201d He asks doubtfully.\nThat would be one sad ploy, if that were the case. They were never going to let their guard down around Kushina, and with this theory in hand now, they\u2019d increase their guard until the mystery group was well and firmly dealt with.\n\u201cKirigakure has been strangely silent on this matter.\u201d Sarutobi informs him with a strange note to his voice.\nMinato pauses in his thoughts to look up at him searchingly. Sarutobi\u2019s eyes are narrowed on his hands, fiddling with his pipe. Wherever his thoughts are, they can\u2019t be anywhere good. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t want to admit their bijuu got swept out from under their feet by a random missing-nin.\u201d Minato points out and Sarutobi gives a small, noncommittal hum. \u201cWhat are you thinking, Hokage-sama?\u201d\n\u201cHm. Nothing yet.\u201d Sarutobi huffs, lifting his pipe back to his mouth. \u201cHow is Obito-kun?\u201d\nMinato grimaces deeply. \u201cNot well, unsurprisingly.\u201d He mutters, reaching up to run his hand through his hair. Ugh, he really needs a shower, too. A shower and a bed. \u201cHaruna, the Yamanaka assigned to him has finally cleared him for visitation, but\u2026 it hasn\u2019t gone well. Kakashi refuses to go, and Rin cried, and then  he  cried, and then she tried to hug him-\u201d\nAnd then he threw Rin across the room and only Minato\u2019s quick movements had stopped her from going through a window, and then Obito had a mental breakdown from sheer guilt and panic.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t go well.\u201d Minato concludes quietly.\n\u201c...Understandable, of course.\u201d Sarutobi says just as solemnly, exhaling a plume of smoke into the room. \u201cA year in the grasp of Madara Uchiha himself. If I was not - as she claims -  gifted  his head, then I wouldn\u2019t believe it possible.\u201d Sarutobi heaves a heavy sigh that only makes Minato feel more exhausted, mentally and physically. \u201cHe has been through an incredible trial, and now he must go through another before he\u2019ll be able to stand on his own two feet again.\u201d Literally, unfortunately.\nIt hurts to even think about it. Minato can\u2019t even  imagine  waking up to find out Madara Uchiha himself had cut off a quarter of your body and replaced it with\u2026 well. Alien DNA of some sort, apparently. Something never seen before, with Hashirama cells scattered throughout to make it even more concerning. He can\u2019t even imagine it, and the knowledge that his student spent a year  living it  is utterly horrifying.\nAnd then there was the matter of the chakra that had radiated through him when he first returned. Minato and Kushina had recognized it immediately, of course. It was the same chakra that had been in Rin, only even more potent.  Much  more potent. Possibly because of how long he may have had it, as opposed to her only having it for several hours. Regardless, two things were very obvious.\nWhatever the chakra was, it had been used to put an incredibly dark curse of some unknown distinction directly on Obito and Rin\u2019s hearts.\nAnd second, Obito\u2019s memories attested to the fact that their \u2018removal\u2019 had come in the form of being stabbed in the heart and healed, which was upsetting enough in it\u2019s own right.\n\u201cWill he?\u201d Minato asks distantly, resting his arms on his knees, and Sarutobi offers a questioning hum.\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cWill Obito get his feet under him? Does he have a place to stand?\u201d Minato questions, dreading the answer. He lifts his gaze to meet Sarutobi\u2019s again, and \u2026 yeah. He knows the answer.\n\u201cCurrently, no.\u201d Sarutobi confirms damningly, calm and casual like he wasn\u2019t destroying a boy\u2019s entire life and all his dreams with those two words. Minato closes his eyes for a moment, dreading having to tell him. Obito would  really  have a mental breakdown then, and, to be fair, that\u2019s a pretty good argument for him  not  being reinstated. \u201cHowever, I see no reason to rush the decision.\u201d Sarutobi sweeps on, and Minato blinks at him in confusion. \u201cOur young Uchiha has given absolutely everything for his village. His life, his limbs, and now, quite possibly his mental stability.\u201d\nWhat a nice way to say he was probably certifiably insane.\n\u201cIt would be beyond cruel to abandon him now. It would be heartless, and it would be no way to treat our heroes. Make no mistake, the boy is a hero.\u201d Sarutobi says the last part softly, gazing past Minato and at, strangely enough, the Hokage portraits on the far wall. \u201cNo, we will hold our decision for now. Give the boy time to recover. Perhaps, in a few months time, we will reconsider our choice.\u201d Sarutobi taps thoughtfully on his pipe and then turns back to Minato, offering him a warm, sympathetic smile. \u201cEven if we do not, he won\u2019t be abandoned - don\u2019t doubt that.\u201d\nHe won\u2019t.\nHe won\u2019t doubt that, because Sarutobi looks more sincere than he has in the past two years of this miserable war.\nSo Minato offers him a tired smile in response, and excuses himself to go eat some of Kushina\u2019s dinner, probably cry on her a lot, and then get some well earned sleep.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNagato\u2019s meeting with them goes something like this:\nHe\u2019s sitting alone, minding his own business, and contemplating the damage of Hanzo\u2019s latest attack against the Akatsuki. There\u2019s a loud, shattering, earth-rocking explosion outside of the Akatsuki\u2019s den.\nHe steps out to investigate, and the next thing he knows, he\u2019s waking up to see a pink-haired woman pocketing a jar holding his floating eyeballs, while a glowing blonde-haired man yells at her and the black-haired man beside her.\nHe vomits, as is the natural reaction to such a sight.\n\u201c-that, damn it! But you didn\u2019t need to do all this! Oh my  god, Sakura, what the  fuck!\u201d The blonde is yelling when he comes back to himself enough to figure out that something\u2019s weird as hell.\nHe just saw his eyeballs get pocketed.\nHe just  saw  it.\nThese two facts\u00a0did not add up.\nNagato pulls his headband off, using the reflection to stare at\u2026\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Nagato croaks, because while he doesn\u2019t remember much of his childhood, he  does  remember his black eyes, and these are definitely blue. Blue, blue eyes. They look ridiculous with his red hair.\u201cI expected this kind of violent bullshit from Sasuke, but you, too? What in the  hell  , woman?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d The pink-haired woman huffs at the blonde, who falls eerily silent for a split second, and Nagato looks up to see he looks a little terrified before he rallies himself again.\n\u201cYou knocked them out! You knocked them all out! With fists! And Sharingan! AND THEN YOU RIPPED OUT HIS EYEBALLS!\u201d The blonde  shrieks.\nThe black-haired man sighs heavily and lifts one hand up to silence the blonde. \u201cCalm  down, Naruto. It was the simplest option, even if it was the more violent one. What did you want us to do, exactly? Come in here and demand his eyes?\"\u201cThen\u00a0we\u2019d really have had to be violent.\u201d The pink-haired woman adds, rolling her eyes, and then she looks straight at Nagato and waves.\nWhat the fuck.\n\u201cYOU RIPPED OUT-  \u201d Naruto starts to scream, and is promptly cut off by the woman roundhouse kicking him the face. Naruto flies away with a high-pitched \u2018eeee\u2019, like something out of a manga, and crashes into the side of the cave entrance. \u201cOh my  god  that hurts. You horrid woman!\u201d\n\u201cWatch it.\u201d Sakura snaps back at him, lifting a fist to tug a glove on over it. Naruto falls immediately silent, and then finally seems to notice Nagato.\n\u201cOh god. I\u2019m so sorry, man, I should never have let them handle this. I should\u2019ve known they\u2019d do something like this,\u201d Naruto says in an apologetic rush, turning to shoot Sasuke a vicious glare.\n\u201cRelax, he\u2019s fine.\u201d Sakura waves them both off, walking over to crouch in front of Nagato.\nNagato can\u2019t quite move anymore.\nAt all.\nWhat the hell?\n\u201cDon\u2019t panic. We wouldn\u2019t blame you for getting violent, but it wouldn\u2019t be the ideal option right now, so we\u2019re just going to keep you still until we\u2019re done here.\u201d Sakura explains to him, folding her arms across her crouched knees and frowning at him. Sasuke starts to circle through the cave, disappearing behind Nagato\u2019s head, and fear belatedly starts to sink in, finally making it\u2019s way through the shock and sheer what-the-fuckage of the situation. Naruto hops up and hurries over, crouching down next to Sakura and giving him an apologetic look.\n\u201cNo, really, don\u2019t worry. No one\u2019s getting hurt, I promise. Well, some of them will have headaches.\u201d Naruto shoots Sakura a vicious glare this time, and Sakura responds by smiling in a way that is utterly terrifying, to which  Naruto  responds by quickly looking back at him and pretending to not be a little paler. \u201cWe kind of needed the Rinnegan.\u201d\nOh, god.\nNow he feels nauseous.\nHis  eyeballs. In a  jar.\n\u201cYeah, I know, sorry about the shock value.\u201d Sakura shrugs at him in a \u2018what can you do\u2019 kind of way.\nYou could start by  not stealing my\u00a0eyeballs, is Nagato\u2019s expert opinion.\n\u201cNo offense. It\u2019s just that we know how powerful these damned things are and, frankly, you haven\u2019t tapped it yet. We didn\u2019t want to be the ones to trigger it accidentally.\u201d Sakura offers with a vague shrug. \u201cHere\u2019s the completely freaky thing though, they actually weren\u2019t yours to begin with. Surprise.\u201d\n What.\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s actually right. Long ass story. Short version is, crazy asshole gave you his Rinnegan eyeballs right before he died so his servant could manipulate you into resurrecting said crazy asshole after you activated the Rinnegan. Of course, to \u2018activate\u2019 it, you have to go through watching your best friend get slaughtered, so his servant probably would\u2019ve set him up to die in front of you and then manipulated you into doing something completely batshit crazy.\u201d Naruto \u2018explains\u2019 in a long, unhelpful rush. \u201cLike, I don\u2019t know, \u2018hey let\u2019s resurrect the motherfucking Juubi\u2019 kind of batshit crazy.\u201d\nAgain,  what?\n\u201cYeah like that\u2019s possible, right?\u201d Sakura says and there\u2019s a tiny, nervous little titter to her tone, followed by an absolutely not suspicious glare and elbow-jab at Naruto\u2019s side.\n\u201cOw! Oh, right. Sorry. Juubi\u2019s totally a myth.\u201d Naruto informs Nagato matter-of-factly. \u201cOw, what? I did what you wanted!\u201d Naruto snaps at Sakura, who had elbowed him again.\n\u201cAnyways.\u201d Sakura says dryly, ignoring Naruto. \u201cThose are your actual eyes, by the way. I killed the crazy asshole in this bizarre story, got your eyes back, took his eyes out of your head, and put yours back in. You\u2019re welcome, by the way. It doesn\u2019t seem obvious yet, but the Rinnegan was taking up about 60% of your entire chakra network.\u201d Sakura explains grimly, lips twisting down. \u201cIf you\u2019d activated it, it would\u2019ve shot up to more like 95%. You would be at the edge of death your entire life if that had happened. Now, though\u2026\u201d Sakura pauses, glancing at Naruto and then offering Nagato a tiny, apologetic smile.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the circumstances. I know this is an unpleasant shock, of course, but it had to be done. On the bright side, without the Rinnegan to suck up your chakra, you\u2019ll be much more powerful and have much more stamina than before. You\u2019ll really live up to your Uzumaki lineage now.\u201dTo his what what?\nUzumaki? Lineage? Who the hell are the Uzumaki and how could she possibly know more about his lineage than  him?\n\u201cAh. That\u2019s surprise on his face.\u201d Naruto informs Sakura, eyeing Nagato\u2019s face intently. \u201cIt\u2019s the hair, man. The hair and the chakra reserves. You\u2019ve got huge ones, almost as big as mine, and trust me when I say that is  seriously  saying something.\u201d He says, then glances at Sakura. \u201cMy natural ones, I mean.\u201d\u201cAh. Good, I was concerned for a second. If you meant your, ah... enhanced chakra reserves, then our plan would be seriously flawed.\u201d\u201cYeah, no kidding.\u201d Naruto snorts softly, then looks back at Nagato. \u201cI\u2019m an Uzumaki, too. My mom - she had red hair, though not as dark as yours. It\u2019s classic Uzumaki. Sakura\u2019s got Uzumaki in her, too, hence the pink.\u201d Naruto jabs a thumb at his companion, who offers Nagato another small grin, and then he frowns thoughtfully. \u201cActually, thinking about it, we\u2019re really lucky I didn\u2019t end up with pink hair, too.\u201d\n\u201cThat  would be hysterical.\u201d Sakura says with a shameless snort of amusement. \u201cUnluckily, I\u2019m a quarter Uzumaki, so the red-hair thing is kind of diluted now. No idea why you ended up  blonde  though.\u201d\u201cHell if I know. Ridiculously strong genes?\u201d Naruto offers with a shrug.\u201cShame his IQ genes weren\u2019t as strong as his hair color ones.\u201d Sakura mutters.\nNagato\u2026\nHas no idea how to react to any of this.\nHe feels mildly like he\u2019s been hit in the brain with a sledgehammer, really.\nThe black-haired companion, Sasuke, wanders back over and nods at his companions, who quickly stand up. \u201cSorry again, Nagato. But we\u2019re not heartless assholes. We\u2019re leaving you a couple of badass jutsus you should be able to use with your refreshed chakra reserves, and it\u2019ll help you compensate for the loss of the Rinnegan.\u201d Naruto offers with grim apology. \u201cWe agree with your cause, and you haven\u2019t done anything to deserve, well,\u201d Naruto shoots his companions another disapproving look, gesturing vaguely at the hideout cave as a whole. \u201cAnyways, we seriously owe you one hell of a compensation for this crap.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, though.\u201d Sakura says, and there\u2019s that unsettling smile again. She and Naruto step back and Sasuke crouches in front of him, his one visible black eye fixing on him with unsettling intensity. \u201cWe\u2019ll start paying you back by giving Hanzo a little visit once we're done here.\u201d Sakura informs him with dark promise.\nBefore he can react, Sasuke lifts a hand up to pull his hair away from his other eye. Nagato sees red, and then he\u2019s unconscious again.\nHanzo was something many people would describe as a monster.\nAn atrocity to mankind.\nAn evil dictator with a record for mass murdering his own people.\nHe was enough of a something, in fact, that even  Naruto  wasn\u2019t against the plan.\u201cGo forth and fuck shit up.\u201d Naruto instructs, throwing his arms out in a wide, open gesture at the palace they were standing in front of.\n\u201cSasuke?\u201d Sakura asks, turning towards him with a gleeful glint in her eye.\n\u201cSakura.\u201d Sasuke states dryly, and it\u2019s a testament to how long they\u2019ve been together that both Naruto and Sakura are able to discern that as an enthusiastic agreement rather than just a monotonic noun.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get the little people out of the way.\u201d Naruto assures them, and then promptly floods the palace with approximately three hundred of himselves.\n\u201cStay back, dear.\u201d Sakura calls over her shoulder as she draws her sword, the red chakra blade gleaming even in the black of night. \u201cCan\u2019t have anyone noticing our trump card, after all.\u201d\n\u201cIs that all I am, now?\u201d Shikamaru asks dryly from where he crouches, very carefully concealed by the shadows. Sasuke snorts softly and Sakura turns to shoot Shikamaru a wicked grin.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t all be legendary for our combat prowess. We\u2019ll be back!\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d Shikamaru mutters before she and Sasuke dart into the palace in a pair of inhumanly fast streaks of blue and red chakra.\nYes, Hanzo was an evil man. If even Naruto himself couldn\u2019t deny that, then he most certainly deserved the shock of having two shinobi cut through his forces like hot knives through butter.\nAnything that stands in their way, never stands up ever again.\nHanzo barricades himself in his makeshift little throne room, where he makes the decisions on which of his people\u2019s lives will be pointlessly thrown away next, and keeps his strongest with him. He\u2019s the strongest of them all, though, of course.\nWhich is why Sasuke bypasses all the shinobi, leaving them for Sakura to quickly and effectively deal with. He goes straight for Hanzo, his black eye bleeding red, and stops right in front of the man.\nAll it takes is one look, and Hanzo never even notices the sword slicing through his neck. He\u2019s too busy spending three days being tortured in Tsukuyomi, and by the time he gets out of it, he\u2019s already on the ground in a pool of his own blood, with a perfect view of his shinobi force being completely decimated by a girl with pink hair.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAmegakure is a complete and utter clusterfuck, locked in the\u00a0middle\u00a0of three separate warring Great Countries.\nWhich is why it takes two months for the news to spread, at which point the jinchuuriki in Takigakure has already vanished as well.\nThe news comes in the form of Jiraiya, who has the good luck of stomping into the Hokage\u2019s office while Minato, Kushina, Shikaku, and Sarutobi are all there. The grim look on his face promises only the worst kind of news, and the room goes immediately silent at his entrance. \u201cI have bad news.\u201d Jiraiya says by way of hello, wasting no time on pleasantries even though it\u2019s been four years since he was last in Konoha, which means it\u2019s  really  the worst news. He strides forward and holds out a bingo book, fingers tucked in to open it on the page of a familiar pink-haired pain in the ass.\n\u201cShe\u2019s earned a name for herself.\u201d Sarutobi says quietly as they all take in the paper.\n\u201cUzumaki?\u201d Kushina asks faintly, staring at the page.\nSakura Uzumaki, dubbed \u2018Akashi\u2019.\n\u201cThe Red Death.\u201d Jiraiya confirms darkly, allowing Shikaku to take the book and examine it more closely. \u201cThis is the updated edition. I\u2019m the one who updated it - turn the page.\u201d Jiraiya adds, and Shikaku arches an eyebrow before doing just that. Sarutobi\u2019s eyebrows shoot up as he takes in her two comrades, while Kushina makes another soft sound of distress and Minato grimaces.\n\u201cNaruto Uzumaki and Sasuke. No name for him?\"\u201cNot yet.\u201d Jiraiya grimaces deeply. \u201cBut whoever he is, he\u2019s damned good. I came here straight from Amegakure.\u201d Jiraiya adds, drawing the full attention of the four back on him. He sits down heavily across from the sofa and chairs they\u2019re all perched on, reaching out to set a picture on the table. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be furious with me. I\u2019m sorry, but hopefully you\u2019ll understand why I never told anyone about this.\u201d Jiraiya says directly to Sarutobi, who frowns softly before taking a closer look at the photograph.\nThere\u2019s a long moment while they all take in the three children in the picture, and then Kushina slowly asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s with the eyes?\u201d\n\u201cNagato, who Sakura and Naruto claim is also an Uzumaki by the way, was a student of mine during the Second war.\u201d Jiraiya explains grimly, shaking his head apologetically at Sarutobi, whose frown is growing deeper and deeper as his mind works. \u201cI accepted the three of them as my students because of Nagato. The other two are Konan and Yahiko, but Nagato\u2026 Nagato had the Rinnegan.\u201d\nSilence fills the room at that, tense and unpleasant, and Sarutobi looks up from the photograph to lock Jiraiya with an unreadable stare.\nJiraiya winces a little. Yep - definitely furious.\n\u201cI thought that was a myth.\u201d Minato says slowly.\n\u201cI did too. But he had it. The real deal.\u201d Jiraiya sighs heavily, folding his arms across his chest. He ignores Sarutobi\u2019s stare for the moment, focusing on the task ahead. \u201cHe sent me a letter six weeks ago. I rushed there immediately. He, and the organization Yahiko now runs to fight off Hanzo, were attacked and completely, effortlessly subdued by the so called Akashi and her comrade, Sasuke.\u201d Jiraiya explains, shaking his head. \u201cNagato woke up after Sakura had already taken his eyes.\u201d\nMinato inhales sharply at that and Shikaku scowls, glaring down at the book in his hand. \u201cShe has the Rinnegan now?\"\u201cYes. And according to them, it was never Nagato\u2019s to begin with.  They  claim that a man, who they referred to as \u2018crazy asshole\u2019, was the one to awaken the Rinnegan. That when he got too old to go on, he had his servant take the eyes and implant them into baby Nagato, as part of a long-term ploy to manipulate Nagato into using the eyes to resurrect said \u2018crazy asshole\u2019.\u201d Jiraiya pauses for a second, because for some reason this news makes Minato shoot Sarutobi a sharp look, and the old man gives a tiny nod.\nHe doesn\u2019t ask - not yet, at least. One thing at a time.\n\u201cThey went on to claim that after they\u2019d killed this so called \u2018crazy bastard\u2019, they took back Nagato\u2019s old, preserved eyes and reimplanted them after taking his Rinnegan. Nagato says they also implied heavily that they themselves would be using them. And it, of course, gets worse.\u201d Jiraiya says with a sigh that he feels in his  bones. \u201cI have reason to believe Sasuke is an Uchiha, or at least has the Sharingan.\u201d\n\u201cEvidence?\u201d Shikaku asks after a short pause.\n\u201cNagato says that at the end of their little visit, Sasuke pulled his hair away from where it had been concealing his left eye, and Nagato saw that it was red before he was rendered spontaneously unconscious. He also thinks he heard them say it by name, but he was in shock at the time and can\u2019t say for sure.\u201d Jiraiya gestures vaguely with his hand, mostly just to have something to do as he speaks. \u201cBased off that, I\u2019d say it\u2019s an implant, because his right eye apparently stayed normal. However, his appearance is typical of an Uchiha, so it\u2019s possible he is one through-and-through. Black hair, black eyes, black personality, so on.\u201d\nThat last bit gets a tiny twitch of lips from Kushina, at least.\n\u201cAnd after leaving the Akatsuki, the organization Nagato\u2019s in and Yahiko runs, they apparently went to pay Hanzo a visit to \u2018repay\u2019 Nagato for his \u2018sacrifice\u2019.\u201d Jiraiya says dryly. \u201cWhere they then proceeded to completely slaughter Hanzo and all of the shinobi in his palace. On the bright side, they left the civilians alone, and apparently Sakura even went so far as to heal some of them. Still, the slaughter earned her her new name.\u201d He pauses to let that little tidbit sink in.\nJiraiya, Orochimaru, and Tsunade had faced off against Hanzo once, back in the last War. They earned their names as the Legendary Sannin then, and that was just for holding their own against that madman. These three\u2026 Well. They really had  slaughtered  him.\nJiraiya forces that unpleasant testament to their strength out of his mind for the moment, and clears his throat. \u201cNagato also said something else of interest.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Sarutobi asks quietly and Jiraiya frowns softly.\n\u201cEvidently, Naruto is the one in charge of the trio, contrary to what we believed. Nagato says he was displeased with the amount of violence and\u2026 underhanded behavior when they struck the Akatsuki hideout. While he does appear to be the leader, however, Sakura seemed to be the one with the most authority overall. Apparently, she called most of the shots, but they both ultimately deferred to Naruto when he pressed.\u201d\n\u201cDissent?\u201d Shikaku suggests and Jiraiya shakes his head.\u201cMore like alarmingly good teamwork, with Naruto serving as the team leader.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Shikaku says, and none of them are very reassured.\n\u201cGreat. So our potential enemies are incredibly strong, strong enough to take on someone even the Sannin had difficulty with,  and  they have teamwork on their side.\u201d Minato sighs heavily, rubbing at his forehead.\n\u201cActually, it\u2019d be more accurate to say they made the guy even the Sannin couldn\u2019t beat look like a complete and utter joke.\u201d Jiraiya says dryly, because as unpleasant as it is, it\u2019s pretty damned accurate.\n\u201cRight. Thanks, sensei.\u201d Minato mutters. \u201cDo we know where they are now?\u201d\u201cNo, but I have a suspicion.\u201d Jiraiya tacks on with a sour face, and Sarutobi sighs as well.\n\u201cMore bad news, I presume?\u201d\n\u201cThe worst. I found out why Kiri\u2019s been so quiet about the Sanbi being snatched up.\u201d Jiraiya says, shooting Minato a quick look at that. His poor student didn\u2019t deserve to be dealing with the shitstorm on their horizon. Having one student \u2018killed\u2019 and held prisoner by Madara for a year, another kidnapped by Kiri and nearly turned into the Sanbi\u2019s jinchuuriki with a seal rigged to blow? Hopefully Kakashi\u2019s watching his back, because he\u2019s probably next. Jiraiya lifts a hand to rub at his chin, grimacing darkly. \u201cTheir other jinchuuriki has disappeared. No one seems to know how long he\u2019s been gone.\u201d\nThe room falls silent at that.\nShikaku picks the bingo book back up, frowning down at it intently, while Kushina glares holes into the table and Minato, Sarutobi, and Jiraiya exchange dark looks over her head.\n\u201cIf we track all these incidents, they first appeared in Kirigakure. From there, at least two of them travelled to Madara\u2019s hideout at an unknown location, and then all the way to Konoha\u2019s gates.\u201d Shikaku says slowly, and they all wince a little at that. She\u2019d gotten  alarmingly  close to their home. \u201cIf the various reports are to be believed, then there\u2019s even a possibility that her companion, Sasuke, was the one to murder Danzo Shimura.\u201d Shikaku adds, which makes Sarutobi glare down at the table with a pained expression.\nKushina was the only one in the room who didn\u2019t know the revelations that came out of Danzo\u2019s death, and even thinking about them makes Jiraiya\u2019s stomach churn. To think, he had been close friends with his sensei. \u201cHis sword and lightning affinity would match the cause of death.\u201d Shikaku adds quietly, then clears his throat and sweeps on before they can get too stuck on the idea that one of them actually  did  get into Konoha, all the way down into a hidden base, and brutally killed one of their strongest. \u201cThen they went to Kumogakure and took Yugito Nii and Killer B for some unknown purpose. Then all three of them traveled to\u2026 Takigakure, or Amegakure first?\u201d Shikaku asks Jiraiya, who shrugs a little.\n\u201cThe Amegakure incident was seven weeks ago. Takigakure was\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cSix.\u201d Sarutobi says darkly.\n\u201cSo they went to Amegakure, then Takigakure. If they\u2019re after jinchuuriki, their next stop is Iwa - but why the six weeks of silence?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s assuming they haven\u2019t already hit Iwa.\u201d Minato points out. \u201cIf they have, we wouldn\u2019t know - we\u2019re still in peace talks after Kannabi.\u201d No one can blame him for the small twinge of displeasure at the reminder of that particular mission. \u201cAssuming they have\u2026 they\u2019re either going to Suna, or coming here for Kushina.\u201d\nAnd wasn\u2019t that a pleasant thought. Jiraiya leans back into the sofa, frowning up at the ceiling tiles. \u201cIwa\u2019s got two - the Four and Five-Tails. Thankfully,  those  two are both adults.\u201d Jiraiya adds the last part with maybe a little too much bitterness. Yugito, after all, was only ten years old.\n\u201cDid you discover the identity of the Six-Tailed?\u201d Sarutobi asks like he knows he\u2019s going to hate the answer, and Jiraiya makes a face to confirm that, yeah. Yeah, he is.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get his name, no, but\u2026 the kids\u2019 only seven.\u201d\nDead silence.\n\u201cYeah. The people aren\u2019t very happy, either.\u201d Jiraiya admits quietly, remembering the faces some of his informants had worn.\nThey might not like their jinchuuriki, but even the assholes were feeling the sting of losing a seven year old academy student to an unknown enemy.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKakuzu\u2019s death ends up being purely from bad, bad luck.\nIt\u2019s three weeks after they hit Takigakure, \u2018kidnapping\u2019 their jinchuuriki (Some guy named Yurata. Fuu, being a year younger than Team Seven, had obviously not even been born yet), and Sakura and Shikamaru are travelling to Suna to do some spy work (where the hell is Shukaku and why is it so hard to find the damn bijuu) when they almost literally run into him.\nThey\u2019re jumping through the trees in the Land of Rivers, and Sakura spots him walking casually down the path with all the confidence of a man who is practically immortal. \u201cOh my god!\u201d Sakura gasps, dropping down in front of him. \u201cYou\u2019re Kakuzu!\u201d She accuses, shocked - because really, what the chances? - and the man pauses in his steps.\nHe moves slowly, killing intent filling the area, and clearly aims more for terrifying intimidation rather than actually assessing the threat and responding accordingly.\nGreat. He\u2019s one of the idiots who dismiss her based off her youth and pink hair.\nRegardless, it makes it stupidly easy for Shikamaru\u2019s shadow to dart out at light speed and snag Kakuzu\u2019s, freezing him in place.\n\u201cServes you right.\u201d Sakura huffs, irritated already. Seriously, how long does someone need to be a mass murdering villain for them to  not  go \u2018oh, pink hair? What a wimpy little girl she must be\u2019? \u201cLiterally the only upside to becoming a villain would be recognition, a reputation for fear! And I still haven\u2019t even gotten that much. Is it really too much to ask for?\u201d Sakura mutters bitchily, stomping over to him and drawing her sword.\n That  gets his attention, his eyes widening, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. Of course he doesn\u2019t, because Shikamaru\u2019s the best damned Nara yet, and his jutsus cause  absolute  paralysis.\nHe\u2019s so good that when he\u2019s really focusing, he actually has to regulate his captives breathing for them or they\u2019d die once he grabbed their shadow.\n\u201cYour luck is utter crap, I just want you to know that.\u201d Sakura informs the man, readying her sword. She\u2019ll use it to deal with the hearts she can, then just chakra-punch the rest to pancake batter. \u201cWe actually genuinely forgot about you. Unfortunately for you, you picked the wrong path to take today, and the wrong person to run into. This is for killing my partner\u2019s sensei, you utter piece of shit.\u201d\nShe chops him up like a watermelon on a hot summer day.\nOnly instead of delicious fruit, there\u2019s blood, and instead of icky black seeds, there are bones. Then she punches anything that resists the beautifully incinerating power\u00a0of her fire-chakra sword until they\u2019re nothing but a mushy puddle.\nThen Shikamaru saunters over and lights it all on fire.\n\u201cYay teamwork.\u201d Sakura celebrates with a blood-soaked fist that Shikamaru lazily bumps.\nToo bad Hidan\u2019s probably only, like, two or something. That  really  would\u2019ve made Shikamaru\u2019s day.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKushina\u2019s taking it personally. It worries Minato, but then again, nowadays there\u2019re very few things that don\u2019t.\nRin worries him, with her occasionally shaky hands and bags under her eyes, her denials that anything\u2019s wrong and her strained, but honest smiles.\nKakashi worries him, with his refusal to spend more than a few minutes at a time in the same room as Obito. With his denials that anything\u2019s wrong, as well. With his guilty, shamed glances towards Obito when he thinks no one\u2019s looking.\nObito worries him, with his lack of even attempting to smile. He worries Minato the most, to be truthful. He\u2019s still jumpy, even after two and a half months. He\u2019s still holding back instinctive punches when anyone touches him, and god help you if you surprise him with contact. But Obito can walk now, and that\u2019s helping, Minato thinks. He still doesn\u2019t smile, but Minato isn\u2019t quite so worried about checking in and finding Obito dead on the floor. He\u2019s quiet and he\u2019s not even close to okay, but he\u2019s better. A little bit.\nKushina, on the other hand, is utterly furious.\u201cLet them come for me, I\u2019ll kick their damned asses.\u201d She snarls almost incoherently. \u201cThey\u2019re  my people,  my family, and they want to take me? I\u2019ll let them have me. Yeah, they can have my  foot up their ass!\u201d\nMinato tries to calm her down, but it doesn\u2019t work well. He can\u2019t lie to her. He can\u2019t say that they don\u2019t know why they\u2019re taking jinchuurikis, that maybe it\u2019s not so bad - there\u2019s only bad reasons to be collecting them.  Only  bad reasons.\nIt doesn\u2019t help when Suna\u2019s hit next.\nTheir mystery trio, understandably, also worries Minato quite a bit.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt takes them two weeks of skulking about Suna to find the damn tea kettle.\nThey spend another week trying to figure out how to safely grab it and get out of Suna in tact.\n\u201cThis is taking too long.\u201d Sakura says darkly, worrying her lip, and Shikamaru looks sideways at her with eyes already narrowing in thought.\u201cSasuke?\u201d He questions and she nods, looking out the window of the inn they were staying in.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got us on a time limit, and I haven\u2019t been able to take a look at him in nearly four weeks now. We can\u2019t keep putting this off.\u201d\u201cNo. But do we have much of a choice? You on your own may be able to handle this, but with me-\u201d Shikamaru pauses when she turns to look at him, takes in the manic gleam in her eyes, rolls  his  eyes upwards, and takes a deep, deep breath. \u201cSakura. No.\u201d He says flatly.\u201cSakura  yes.\u201d She corrects breathlessly, grinning.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cShika.\u201d Sakura huffs out, stepping over to stand in front of where he\u2019s perched at the foot of the bed. \u201cYou know it\u2019s smart.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s  reckless  is what it is, Sakura. Facing a group of ANBU on your own was one thing - this is an entire shinobi village.\u201d\u201cEmbrace the villainy. That was your idea, remember?\u201d\u201cYes, because we\u2019re on a deadline and the political route would have taken too long for-\u201d Shikamaru cuts off again, and once more rolls his eyes upwards, praying to whatever deity may or may not exist.\n\u201cYou just made my argument for me.\u201d\u201cThis is different. This is riskier. You\u2019re not talking about pissing off the Elemental Nations from a distance anymore - you\u2019re talking about doing it from the dead center of one of their military strongholds. Suna might not be the biggest or the strongest, but they\u2019re nothing to scoff at, Sakura!\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019m not scoffing!\u201d Sakura says sharply, narrowing her eyes and finally putting on her big girl boots. \u201cListen, Shikamaru,\u201d She says severely, crouching down to be a little less looming. \u201cWe need to be risky now. I need to get back to Sasuke, and we can\u2019t do that without the you-know-what, and I can\u2019t fight at my full strength having to keep one eye on you.\u201d\nHe twitches at that, but can\u2019t really argue. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s weak - it\u2019s just that Sakura\u2019s on another par with the damned Kage.\n\u201cSo get out of here.\" She says, then pauses and grimaces a little. \"You aren\u2019t completely wrong, though. I\u2019m not sure I could get out of here on my own without actually fighting seriously, and people die that way, which would kind of go directly against one of our promises.\u201d Sakura allows with a small wince, Gaara\u2019s last words to them echoing in her head.\n Save my people, he\u2019d pled.\n\u201cSend Naruto my way.\u201d Sakura suggests, frowning at the foot of the bed. \u201cHe\u2019s good at the distracting thing. He\u2019s fast, too, so it won\u2019t take him long to get here and he probably won\u2019t get beat around too much. I\u2019ll grab the you-know-what while he\u2019s distracting, and then we\u2019ll meet you in Tanzaku.\u201d\nShikamaru grimaces, glaring at the ceiling for several tense moments longer. Finally, he reluctantly pushes himself to his feet. \u201cI thought we were avoiding the Land of Fire.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll probably need to ditch them quick. Suna\u2019ll follow us into the Land of Rivers or the Land of Rain, but they won\u2019t follow us into another Great Country. Not during a war like this. We  just  hit Iwa, too, so they\u2019ll be even more on guard than Konoha will be.\u201d\nTheoretically, anyways.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this.\u201d Shikamaru says tightly. \u201cYou\u2019ll be beyond just outnumbered, Sakura, and we both know that ends.\u201dSakura\u2019s expression shutters darkly for a moment before she forces it away and nods, pressing her lips together grimly. \u201cWe\u2019ll ditch the secrecy about our abilities, then, if we get too beat up.\u201d She swears.\nShikamaru nods sharply. \u201cFind me in Tanzaku. I refuse to be the one to tell Sasuke why our plan ends in complete failure.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah. Go on, scram. Tell Naruto to haul ass.\u201d Sakura warns.\nHe nods and walks lazily out of the room instead of  shunshin\u2019ing straight to the gates.\nSometimes pretending to be a civilian is really damn  slow.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor Rasa, the Yondaime Kazekage, his meeting with the infamous group is a...  unique\u2026 experience.\nIt begins when there\u2019s a sudden burst of incredibly strong, but bizarrely  calm  chakra almost directly over the Kazekage tower.\nRasa instantly abandons his desk, rushing from his seat and leaping right out through his office window. Gold dust flies up to catch his heels, halting his fall and then immediately lifting him straight up. Rasa glares at the glowing body hovering above his village, floating up at it as fast as he can.\n\u201cPEOPLE OF SUNAGAKURE!\u201d The glowing body  bellows, far louder than any man has any right to be. \u201cI COME BEARING GRIM TIDINGS! INDEED, YOU MAY EVEN CALL THEM WARN- Ack!\u201d\nRasa hits the man in the face with his gold dust, and the stupid glowing pest doesn\u2019t even try to dodge. The glowing man (what the hell did the bingo book name him as? Naruto. Naruto was the blonde one, and though it was hard to tell with the entire man emitting yellow light like the sun itself, Rasa was fairly confident his hair was blonde) scoots backwards in the air at the force of the gold dust hitting him, but he doesn\u2019t drop, and Rasa clenches his outstretched hand into a fist.\nThe man\u2019s eyes widen as the gold sand attempts to crush his throat, and then a bright spark of lightning has Rasa\u2019s sand tumbling off him uselessly.\nRasa blinks, then narrows his eyes, watching the man hack loudly.\u201cOh my  god, who goes straight for the throat, dude? Dick move, man.\u201d Naruto gasps out a little bit hoarsely, one hand weakly raised to point accusingly at him.\n...Things were not adding up in Rasa\u2019s head, and it made him all the warier of the mysterious man. His gold dust was not so easily impaired. Being a combination of wind and earth jutsu, his kekkei genkai was fairly durable against lightning jutsus, but the man had made it look completely effortless. \u201cWhy are you in my village?\u201d Rasa barks out demandingly, raising both hands to guide more of his gold dust to him.Naruto lifts his head a bit more, taking slower breaths, and shoots him a completely incredulous look. \u201cAren\u2019t you listening? I\u2019m here to warn you!\u201d\n\u201cWarn me.\u201d Rasa repeats flatly, but either the man doesn\u2019t notice the utter contempt in his tone or he flat out doesn\u2019t  care, because he nods seriously.\n\u201cWarn you.\u201d Naruto confirms, then takes a deep breath and says with the utmost severity, \u201cNever send uncles to kill little children.\u201d\nWhat the fuck?\n\u201cNo, seriously! Bad idea, like, all around, dude.\u201d Naruto explains quickly, wrinkling his nose. \u201cI mean,  really  bad idea. Not sure why anyone would ever think it was a good idea in the first place, but trust me when I say, you really just should not even  consider - Hey!\u201d Naruto shrieks, suddenly plummeting ten feet in the air to avoid the gold dust clapping into the space his skull had just been occupying.\nRasa grimaces deeply, wariness only rising, and sends his gold chasing after the man.\nHe\u2019s  fast. Faster than Rasa, by  far, and his gold dust lags behind the glowing man embarrassingly far.\nAnd then the south side of the Kazekage tower explodes.\nRasa snaps his head down to look in alarm, taking in the dirt and dust billowing out, and grits his teeth, reaching out to direct some of his gold dust towards the building.\n\u201cLOOK OUT!\u201d Naruto yells, and then punches him in the face hard enough that Rasa is sent flying off the edge of his gold cloud. The cloud catches him a split second later and Rasa slashes his free hand out at the golden asshole, his other hand still directing dust after him. Air shrieks out from his hand, visibly slicing the space Naruto rather suddenly isn\u2019t occupying anymore. \u201cDon\u2019t trust anyone named with five letters and ending in -anzo!\u201d Naruto yells frantically, darting through the air to avoid the dust.\nRasa grits his teeth, ignoring his rising frustration and angering worry for his subordinates in the tower.\n\u201cI think we pretty much took care of it, but if you ever meet anyone named Pain, just fucking run, man.\u201d\nIt\u2019s damned obvious now that the man is just a distraction, and it\u2019s easy to gather what he\u2019s distracting Rasa from. There\u2019s only one thing in the tower these infamous criminals could be after.\nA soft tickle at the back of his mind confirms his theory, and Rasa frowns grimly as he lifts his free hand, making a quick sign to trigger the trap.\nThe thin layer of gold dust he\u2019d planted on the tea kettle slides up and squeezes, and he  feels  the bones of mystery hands crush under the force of his dust.\nHe swings the hand out, using it to control even more dust, and attempts to trap Naruto between the two streams of crushing gold. Whoever the would-be-thief was, they were now without their hands and his ANBU would be able to deal with them.\n\u201cOrochimaru is a snake! Like, I think he\u2019s actually literally about eighty-percent snake-thing now. Super bad idea to trust him.\u201d Naruto ducks under a swing of dust that  almost  brushes against his hair.\nDamn it.\n\u201cAlso he has a really bad habit of basically eating people\u2019s insides and then wearing their bodies, so, yeah.\u201d Naruto says quickly and a little bit breathlessly. \u201cGod damn your gold sand is fast as fuck, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nApparently not fast enough, Rasa thinks irritably as he misses him  again. Damn it.\nClearly he can\u2019t deal with this annoying, rambling man on his own, which is infuriating, because the guy is obviously too stupid have any right being so skilled. But Rasa didn\u2019t live to be Kazekage by not understanding his own limitations, so he immediately starts to subtly herd the man towards the southern side of the mesa that surrounds Sunagakure.\n\u201cI really think we should just talk about this, Kazekage-sama!\u201d Naruto yelps as he ducks under another wave of golden sand, then jerks to the side to avoid the other. \u201cMaybe we could even-\u201d Naruto pauses, and for a moment Rasa\u2019s concerned he may have noticed how close they already were to the mesa, but he looks down instead.\nRasa doesn\u2019t allow himself to look down, in case it\u2019s a trick.\n\u201cUh. Shit.\u201d Naruto says uncertainly, his brow furrowing with concern, and then he turns and flies for the mesa at breakneck speeds.\nFor a second, Rasa\u2019s so surprised he can only blink. Then he notices the pink-haired body quickly leaping from building to building, approaching the mesa, with a red-haired form in her grasp. Rasa\u2019s eyes narrow dangerously, his heart rate spiking, and he pushes his gold dust cloud towards the mesa as fast as it can go.\nIf the pink-haired girl is there and her hands are intact enough to carry another person, then their third teammate must have been the one to touch the kettle - which means she likely has it herself now. And his ANBU are following at an embarrassingly long distance.\nWho  are  these people? Or  what?\nRasa beats the pink haired woman there, dropping down a few feet from Naruto with his dust hovering at the ready, and she hops up to Naruto\u2019s side only seconds later.\nRasa nearly swallows his tongue.\nShe has Sasori.\nShe has Sasori, and the second she touches the ground, she crouches and forces him to his knees, wraps her arm around his forehead to wrench his head back, and presses a kunai to his neck. Sasori\u2019s wide, terrified eyes stare pleadingly at Rasa, who forces his breathing to stay even.\nHer hands are soaked in drying blood up to her elbows, and while there\u2019s no trace of any breaks or damaged skin, he had felt his sand crawl up approximately that much skin. What the hell  were  they?\n\u201cSorry, Naruto. I ran into someone rather  interesting, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d Sakura asks, and her voice is tight with fury, her eyes lit up with malicious intent.\nRasa grimly wonders how he\u2019s going to break this news to Chiyo.\n\u201cSakura-\u201d Naruto starts, his eyes wide, and then he falls grimly silent as Rasa\u2019s ANBU finally arrive, surrounding the four of them immediately. Rasa flicks his hand up warningly and none of them approach, though they hold their weapons - or their hands already making seals - at the ready.\n\u201cWhat do you want.\u201d Rasa asks flatly, meeting Sakura\u2019s heated stare and trying to ignore Sasori\u2019s terrified one.\n\u201cNothing from you, Kazekage-sama.\u201d Sakura says lightly, and the tone only makes her seem more crazed. Sakura jerks Sasori\u2019s head back pointedly, pressing the kunai down hard. \u201cTell him.\u201d Sakura commands in a terrifyingly flat tone.\nFor a moment, Rasa\u2019s confused. Tell who what?\nBut then Sasori swallows thickly, the kunai drawing a thin line of blood at the movement, and Rasa realizes who she was addressing. Rasa examines the fifteen year old intently, only finally recognizing the faint hints of guilt the boy was showing.\n\u201c...Tell me what, Sasori?\u201d Rasa asks slowly, and gets a vicious grin from Sakura for that.\u201cYes. Tell him  what, Sasori?\u201d She asks, and taps the kunai pointedly against Sasori\u2019s neck.\n\u201cI- I don\u2019t-\u201d Sasori chokes out, no doubt having a hard time speaking with his neck pulled so taut, but Sakura has no sympathy for him. She gives a furious growl and shallowly cuts Sasori\u2019s neck in one smooth motion. It isn\u2019t deep, but it still bleeds relatively hard, and Sasori gives a harsh gasp and jerks a little in her arm.\u201cTELL HIM!\u201d Sakura shouts and Sasori jerks a hand up urgently.\u201cAlright!\u201d Sasori gasps.\nNaruto, Rasa belatedly realizes, is looking firmly away from the proceedings, his head turned and his eyes narrowed at the ground.\n\u201cTell me  what, Sasori?\u201d Rasa demands coldly, and Sasori takes a wet, jerky breath at that.\n\u201cI- It\u2019s- I had-\u201d Sasori struggles to start and Sakura rolls her eyes, her scoff cutting him off.\n\u201cOh, please. Drop the act, Sasori. You\u2019re going to die today, so get it out of your system while you still can.\u201d Sakura huffs and pauses for a moment, Sasori freezing in her grasp. \u201cGo on.\u201d Sakura says, slyly suddenly, like she\u2019s cajoling him. \u201cI know you. I can see how hard you\u2019re fighting it. I\u2019d be willing to bet you\u2019re actually biting your tongue right now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She asks lightly, fingertips digging into his temples.\nRasa watches warily, ready to hit her with his dust if she makes a move. It probably wouldn\u2019t save Sasori\u2019s life, but he had to try.\n\u201cTell him,\u201d Sakura purrs, green gaze darting up from Sasori\u2019s face to sear into Rasa\u2019s instead. \u201cI know how badly you want to brag. Do it. You\u2019re going to die here anyways, what do you have to lose?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a moment more of hesitation, and then the fear bleeds out of Sasori. His eyes go cold and\u2026  smug.\n\u201cThe Sandaime\u2019s dead. I killed him.\u201d Sasori says and Sakura eases her grip on his forehead, allowing him to look Rasa dead in the eye and smirk.\nRasa stares at him uncomprehendingly.\n\u201cHow did you do it, Sasori-chan? Share with the class.\u201d Sakura prompts lightly.\n\u201cPoison.\u201d Sasori snorts softly. \u201cI poisoned his tea for two months and he never noticed.\u201d Sasori\u2019s smirk widens, and Rasa\u2026\n...He has no idea how to even respond to that.\nThey\u2019d been searching for the Third Kazekage for two years now.  Two years, and one of their own, a thirteen year old boy then, had murdered him?\n\u201cGood boy.\u201d Sakura praises, but then her smile dies and her voice goes ice cold. \u201cNow tell them what you did to his body.\u201d She commands, and Sasori doesn\u2019t even hesitate to.\nHe  does  laugh, though. \u201cI made him my greatest weapon.\u201d Sasori chuckles. \u201cI took our  great Sandaime\u2019s  corpse, and I made it into a puppet for me to kill his own people with.\u201d\u201cAnd how many of those people have you killed, by now?\u201d Sakura asks flatly.  This  time, Sasori hesitates. Maybe her tone of voice has finally gotten through to him and he\u2019s remembered what a dangerous position he\u2019s in. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that Rasa suddenly can\u2019t find a single fuck to give the little bastard, and Sasori\u2019s realized he really isn\u2019t getting saved.\nIf she lets him go, he\u2019ll kill him himself.\n\u201c...Thirteen.\u201d Sasori says after a moment.\n\u201cGood boy.\u201d Sakura repeats, but she doesn\u2019t even make an attempt to force lightness into her tone. She stares at Rasa for a moment longer, then looks down at Sasori, pulling his head back again to force him to look back at her. He swallows thickly against the kunai. \u201cOne of those was a very good friend of ours.\u201d Sakura says matter of factly. \u201cWe loved him like a brother, and you killed him. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve never quite forgiven you for that.\u201d Sakura informs him, and then slits his throat so deep that Rasa sees the white of his spine. She drops him instantly, jerking to her feet, and grabs hold of Naruto\u2019s arm.\nBefore Rasa can even understand what he\u2019s seeing, one of the black balls floating behind Naruto\u2019s back drops down to their feet and flattens out into a small platform.\nThey step onto it and it instantly shoots across the sand. \u201cOn me!\u201d Rasa snarls, gathering a gold cloud under his feet, and his ANBU are instantly at his side, rising through to air atop it.\n\u00a0\nIt doesn\u2019t matter.\nThey\u2019re faster, and even when they follow them through tracking instead of line of sight, they\u2019re forced to stop when they cross into the Land of Fire.\nAnd indeed, when Rasa returns home and plans how he\u2019s going to explain things to Chiyo, the tea kettle holding Shukaku\u2019s subdued spirit is gone, and a spray of blood coats the wall behind where it once sat.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJiraiya drops into Konoha again, a month after his last visit. \u201cTwo of them invaded Sunagakure a week ago.\u201d He informs them darkly.\nSarutobi sighs heavily and Minato immediately grimaces, but Shikaku, their only tag-along this time, frowns silently down at the Hokage\u2019s desk.\n\u201cThe damage?\u201d Minato asks wearily and Jiraiya cocks his hip, settling a hand on it.\u201cOnly one death. But we\u2019ll get to that in a second. Apparently, our blonde guy - whose name I still resent, by the way, if you all were curious - has some sort of unknown kekkei genkai. Or at least  I don\u2019t know it. Haven\u2019t heard of a damn thing like it, really.\u201d Jiraiya huffs grumpily. \u201cHe glows bright gold, flies, and is fast as hell. I couldn\u2019t get any more information than that about his skills, but apparently he was faster than the Kazekage\u2019s sand - by a lot. He was acting as a distraction while our favorite pink-haired menace blew a hole into the side of the Kazekage\u2019s Tower. I think we can all gather what she was after.\u201d Jiraiya says dryly.\nAnd, yeah. They could.\u201cWere they successful?\u201d Sarutobi asks and Jiraiya shrugs helplessly.\n\u201cI genuinely can\u2019t say.\u201d He says, and the grumpy tone is back. \u201cSuna\u2019s keeping it all on the downlow. They\u2019re still testing newborns for chakra compatibility, I know that much, but that doesn\u2019t really mean anything.\u201d Jiraiya pauses for a moment and then exhales hard through his nose. \u201cBut I\u2019d say at this point, it\u2019s more than safe to bet they were successful.\u201d\n\u201cWhich means Kushina\u2019s the last.\u201d Minato says hollowly, lifting his hands up and scrubbing at his face.\nHis poor, exhausted face. He hasn\u2019t slept well in over three months, not since they got Rin back - and then Obito in the same week.\n\u201c...Who was the one death you mentioned?\u201d Shikaku asks after a brief, grim moment to reflect on Minato\u2019s point, and Jiraiya\u2019s silent for long enough that Minato lifts his head from his hands.\nJiraiya\u2019s glaring down at the Hokage\u2019s desk, his eyes narrowed, and Minato frowns softly in concern.\n\u201cFrom what my sources could gather, when Sakura broke into the tower, she easily and effortlessly dispatched a team of ANBU sent in after her. When she was leaving, Sasori of the Red Sands tried to confront her, and apparently she\u2026 lost it. I don\u2019t know the details, but she dragged him up to where Naruto and Rasa were fighting. Whatever happened, happened, and Sasori was found with his neck slit down to the bone and Rasa gave a public speech condemning him for the murder of the Third Kazekage and thirteen other Suna citizens. Evidently, he was experimenting turning living humans into puppets, and the Third Kazekage was his greatest success.\u201d Jiraiya says in a flat, almost hollow voice.\n\u201c...Wow.\u201d Minato breathes out, stunned and horrified all at once. \u201cHe was-\u201d He blinks as a thought hits him. \u201cHe was thirteen when the Third died.\u201d Minato realizes suddenly, appalled, and Jiraiya nods grimly.\n Shit. What kind of a child\u2026 and if the Third was his success, then he had to have been practicing on the other thirteen. And for how long? Since he was twelve? Eleven?  Ten?\n\u201cThis is grim news indeed, and it begs the question - what was the connection between the three criminals and Sasori?\u201d Sarutobi questions with a deep frown.\n\u201cDragging him away to publically slit the throat, that\u2019s personal.\u201d Shikaku points out by way of agreement. \u201cSuna\u2019s part in this war have taken them into Ame, Tani, and Ishi. It\u2019s possible our mystery shinobi comes from there.\u201d He says, but even as he does, he looks doubtful.\n\u201cThey\u2019re too strong for that, I\u2019d say.\u201d Minato says with a small frown. \u201cToo strong for anywhere, really. This is getting ridiculous. Rasa\u2019s sand is fast enough to keep even me on my toes. We know she and the other one, Sasuke, are both highly skilled in kenjutsu and that she, at least, is a skilled medic-nin.\u201d\u201cDamn  skilled, too.\u201d Jiraiya says with a sour face. \u201cOnly other medic-nin I know who can fix someone who\u2019s gotten stabbed and electrocuted directly through the heart is, well, Tsunade.\u201d The admission seems to pain him, and he winces a little at the reminder of his old teammate, long since gone from Konoha now.\u00a0\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Minato sighs at that. \u201cSasuke may or may not have the Sharingan, and apparently, Naruto can fly.\u201d\u201cHate that kid,\u201d Jiraiya mutters uncharitably.\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re probably coming after Kushina next.\u201d Shikaku concludes grimly. There\u2019s a moment of silence, and then they all automatically look at Sarutobi for guidance.\nSarutobi puffs at his pipe for a long moment more, eyes narrowed in dangerous thought. He exhales a deep breath of smoke and sets the pipe down. \u201cShikaku.\u201d Sarutobi begins commandingly, standing and rising to his full height. Minato immediately climbs to his feet as well, Jiraiya a split second behind him, and Shikaku straightens his back and meets Sarutobi\u2019s gaze. \u201cPull back as many forces from the Iwa front as you need. I want eighty shinobi. Ten teams of eight, formed of exclusively jounin and chuunin - as many jounin as we can spare, Shikaku, and only the most highly praised chuunin. We need brutality and force. An Inuzuka, and a Hyuuga or Uchiha on each team.\u201d Sarutobi rattles off sharply.\n\u201cTrack them down, Shikaku. If they take one step into our Land, I want them taken in. Use caution in excess. If there are more than two of them in our territory, the team is to wait for another team to join them before attacking - and they  will  attack. Strike with extreme prejudice. Equip them with T&amp;I\u2019s best chakra suppressors. If they cannot contain them, if they cannot capture them effectively, then they are to kill them.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Hokage-sama. I will place one Nara on each team as well.\u201d Shikaku agrees immediately, bowing to the elderly man. \u201cOur shadow jutsus will be incredibly helpful in capturing and restraining them.\u201d\n\u201cLead a team yourself, Shikaku. I want you to be out there - I trust in your skill and they will need your guidance. Minato, lead another.\u201d Sarutobi says, making him jump a bit.\nHe wasn\u2019t expecting that. He was due to return to the Kiri front in two weeks, in fact. Minato frowns a little at that, but bows without hesitation. \u201cYes, Hokage-sama.\u201d\u201cGo. Choose your teams, Shikaku, and if you need any from the fronts, then Minato will go and fetch them. They move too quickly for us to waste any time.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll lead another team, Hokage-sama.\u201d Jiraiya volunteers with a deep set frown. \u201cOr if nothing else, I\u2019ll join one. It  has  been some time since I last worked with a group.\u201d\nShikaku waits until Sarutobi nods to agree. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely welcome. I\u2019ll find a place for you.\u201d\nMinato chews his lip worriedly, watching Jiraiya incline his head at the Jounin Commander. \u201cI want Hizashi.\u201d Minato chimes in before Shikaku\u2019s brain can get too far ahead. \u201cHizashi and Kakashi.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d is all he offers, but Minato isn\u2019t going to press.\nIf Shikaku decides to place Hizashi elsewhere, then it\u2019ll be for the better.\n\u201cI\u2019ll also try to put both a Hyuuga and Uchiha on each team. Brace yourself for the tension.\u201d Shikaku adds with a soft snort.\nAnd wasn\u2019t that an understatement?\n\u00a0\nMeanwhile, quite a distance away, nine shinobi sit in a brightly lit cave, trying to ignore the eerie sounds filling it.\n\u201cDoes this hurt?\u201d Sakura asks blandly, breaking the awkward silence, and jabs Sasuke\u2019s ribs.\n\u201cYes.\u201d He informs her flatly.\u201cAnd this?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnd here?\u201d Sakura asks, switching to his other side.\n\u201cYes, Sakura.\u201d Sasuke snaps and Sakura pulls back, frowning at him.\n\u201cWell you\u2019ve gotten testier, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d She mutters, brushing her fingers off on her pant leg. \u201cIt\u2019s worse, of course, but we still have time. Two months, give or take.\u201d Sakura says, glancing over her shoulder at the source of the light and dull roaring. \u201cWe\u2019re almost ready, so we\u2019ll make the schedule just fine.\u201d\u201cHmph. Only if Naruto manages to figure this out.\u201d Sasuke points out, shooting a glare in the same direction.\n\u201cOh, please, like you figured out everything in the first week of having a dojutsu. I  remember  you after waking up your Sharingan, Sasuke. You didn\u2019t know shit.\u201d Sakura informs him curtly.\n\u201cHe knew how to get carried through the Forest of Death.\u201d Shikamaru points out boredly, studying the light in the distance.\nSakura smirks and arches an eyebrow at Sasuke, who glares at the back of Shikamaru\u2019s head.\n\u201cThank you, Shikamaru.\u201d He says in a particularly not grateful tone.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the forest of death?\u201d\nGuilt churns Sakura\u2019s stomach, but she turns her head with a warm smile any ways. \u201cIt\u2019s a training ground in Konoha, Utakata. A huge one, with all sorts of freaky giant animals. I saw a centipede in there once that was fifty feet long.\u201d Sakura tells informs him, and the seven year old\u2019s eyes widen at that.\n Too young,  her brain mourns.  Far too young. \n\u201cFifty feet?\u201d He repeats, stunned, and she nods.\n\u201cWe had our Chuunin Exams there, in fact. Naruto got eaten by a snake that was at  least  a hundred feet long.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa.\u201d Utakata shoots an impressed look over his shoulder and Sakura lifts her gaze to meet Sasuke\u2019s amused one.\nKids are cute.\nUtakata falls silent for a moment and when Sakura looks back over to see why, he\u2019s watching Yugito talk to Killer B several feet away. The boy looks pensive, and it\u2019s easy enough to guess why.He and Yugito didn\u2019t get along.\nWhile Yugito had been pushed and pushed and pushed, so much so that Sakura had half a mind to go back and punch the hell out of the Third Raikage, Utakata had been treated more like Naruto. While Yugito had been forced to go through a horrible \u2018training\u2019 regimen, Utakata had been abandoned. While Yugito had become loved by her people as a Chuunin at the age of eight, Utakata was still loathed and only an academy student. And where Yugito was a mature kunoichi who had grown up quickly in the violent horrors of the Third War, Utakata was still very much a naive child.\nNo doubt the talk of the Chuunin exams was only reminding him of just how different he and the ten year old were.\n\u201cIt\u2019s finishing up.\u201d Roshi interrupts them all, jutting his chin towards the light, and Sakura turns to confirm.\nHe\u2019s right. The thick beams of light siphoning from the tea kettle and into the Juubi\u2019s statue are starting to die down, and the howling is easing. It gets less and less bright until finally, the jutsu cuts off all together, and Naruto comes out of his meditation panting for breath.\nThere\u2019s a moment where they all stare at the Juubi in pensive silence, and then a second one of it\u2019s eyes slide fully open and stare eerily into the cave.\n\u201cOnly took three days this time! At that rate, we\u2019re really looking fine!\u201d B cheers loudly and exuberantly enough that Naruto can\u2019t help but grin and lift his hand in a thumbs up, even though he stays doubled over and panting.\nSasuke silently heads over to him and Sakura goes to do the same, wanting to make sure the jutsu hadn\u2019t overexerted him, but Utakata snags her hand.\nShe glances down, catches one look at his uneasy expression, and drops down to crouch beside him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d She asks him quietly, too lowly for the others to hear as they make their way over to Naruto. Only Han lingers behind, watching Utakata with concerned eyes.\n(At least, Sakura thinks he looks concerned. It\u2019s hard when literally the only unarmored part of him are his eyes themselves.)\n\u201cSakura-san?\u201d He asks uncertainly, looking past her to watch the Juubi statue warily, and Sakura frowns softly. \u201cIs it going to eat me, too?\u201d Utakata asks quietly.\n Shit, kid,  Sakura thinks, her stomach churning viciously with guilty nausea. It takes her a second to respond, swallowing thickly. \u201cIt might, Utakata.\u201d She confesses softly, hating herself for the way it makes Utakata look at the Juubi with even more worry, but she can\u2019t lie to him.\nIt\u2019s bad enough they\u2019re asking a seven year old to do this. They can\u2019t  lie  to him about it on top of that.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s what this is for, remember?\u201d Sakura reminds him gently, pointing at the crowd surrounding Naruto. \u201cThat\u2019s what all of this is far.\u201d Sakura reaches out and taps him on the cheek, forcing his attention back to her, and he looks up at her and gulps. She flashes him her warmest, more reassuring smile, and pretends it doesn\u2019t feel like glass in her heart. \u201cI  promise , Utakata. Even if the Juubi gets you, we\u2019ll just beat it up and get you back.\u201d\nMaybe it\u2019s the smile. Maybe it\u2019s the silly lightness of her tone.\nWhatever it is, it makes Utakata relax and smile back at her. Then he turns and rushes over towards the others, only shooting the Juubi one quick glance on his way past.\nShe tries not to feel like she\u2019s just lied to him. She hasn\u2019t, not really, but\u2026 he\u2019s too young to fully understand the implications.\nHan, however, stares at her for a very, very long minute before he offers her a slight incline of his head.\n\u201cYou are a good woman, Sakura. No matter the outcome, you - and your teammates - have my utmost respect.\u201d He says quietly.\nShe looks at him for a long moment, startled, and then flashes a smile that only makes her feel her exhaustion even stronger. \u201cBelieve me, Han. You all have ours, as well.\u201d She pushes herself to her feet and claps her hand to his bicep, almost immediately withdrawing her hand because  ow fuck that\u2019s hot as shit, dude, what the hell,  and then super nonchalantly lowers her hand back to her side.\nThe asshole still looks amused, not matter how casually she pulled that move off. \u201cSteam, Sakura.\u201d He reminds her in that soft, naturally dangerous tone of his, and she rolls her eyes and looks away with a sniff.\n\u201cIt was intentional.\u201d She lies.\nTerribly.\nShe totally forgot his armor held a ton of steam under it, damn it. She ignores Han\u2019s raised eyebrow and walks over to Naruto, clapping her hands together once and smirking. He looks up at her and instantly winces. \u201cAlright! Let\u2019s get those eyes switched back around.\u201d\n\u201cUhg.\u201d Naruto groans, reaching up to rub the eyes in question. \u201cFine. Damn, these things are draining as hell.\u201d He adds miserably.\nSakura pats him on the shoulder sympathetically, and then knocks him unconscious.\nSurprisingly enough, the members of what was once Team Seven (plus Shikamaru) were not, in fact, very comfortable with the idea of sacrificing a living person for the sake of reviving some dead dude for all of twenty four hours.\nUnsurprisingly, none of them had such qualms about having Naruto hunt down one of the scattered White Zetsu\u2019s left and sacrificing one of  them  for it.\n\u201cAh, the dulcet tones of literal monsters getting their due.\u201d Sakura sighs blissfully at the agonized screaming.\n\u201cOh god I\u2019m going to puke.\u201d Naruto groans and then dips out to do exactly that.\n\u201cPoor guy.\u201d Sakura watches him go sympathetically.\n\u201cIt must be exhausting, being burdened with such tedious things like morals.\u201d Shikamaru agrees blandly.\nSo blandly that it takes her a second.\nShe sits up and frowns at him, ignoring the way Zetsu\u2019s still wailing in the background. \u201cAre you accusing me of having no morals? Because I have morals.\u201d\n\u201cName one.\u201d Shikamaru counters instantly.\n\u201cI\u2019m super not okay with\u2026\u201d Sakura starts, pauses, and curses mentally.\n Quick, Inner, give me something,  Sakura presses, but she silenced Inner like ten years ago, and the violent little bastard isn\u2019t getting free anytime soon.\nDamn it.\n\u201c...hitting babies.\u201d\n\u201cOh, of course. The babies. Woe are they.\u201d Shikamaru drawls, not even bothering to open his eyes.\n\u201cScrew  you.\u201d Sakura shoots back disdainfully, rising to her feet just as the screams finally taper off.\nZetsu\u2026 kind of explodes.  Kind of. \nInto dust and stuff, or something, which then reforms into a more familiar shape. \u201cExcellent, it worked. Good job, Sasuke, you evil bastard you.\u201d Sakura praises, ignoring the resurrected guy for a moment.\n\u201cUh. What?\u201d Said guy starts to say before Sasuke makes a quick hand gesture and he shuts firmly up.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Sasuke belatedly responds to Sakura, inclining his head, and he actually does look a little bit pleased.\n...Maybe her \u2018evil\u2019 claim wasn\u2019t as much of a  tease  as she thought.\n\n\u201cRight. I\u2019m going to get the target. Stay safe, no one die. That means  you, Sasuke!\u201d She adds sharply over her shoulder before breaking into a sprint.\nIt\u2019s ridiculously easy to find the damn woman.\nIt\u2019s  stupidly easy to piss her off into chasing her.\nLiterally all Sakura does is grab her briefcase and run.\n\u201cHEY! YOU LITTLE PINK HAIRED MOTHERFUCKER!\u201d Tsunade screeches and Sakura high tails it the fuck out of there. \u201cGET BACK HERE AND I MIGHT SPARE YOUR LIFE!\u201d\nHah, yeah, no.\nFuck that, she likes her ribs not being dust.\nSakura goes as fast as she can, and when she gets back to the small clearing in the trees, she drops the briefcase into Dan\u2019s paralyzed lap and grabs Shikamaru by the front of his shirt, hauling him up onto her shoulder before he can even wake back up. \u201cTime to go, good luck, Dan, you have twenty four hours, bye!\u201d Sakura blurts out in a rush and makes her escape, Sasuke and a returned Naruto smartly following right at her heels.\nThey don\u2019t stick around to hear Tsunade\u2019s reaction, because they\u2019re short enough on time as it is - and also because Sasuke picks that moment, two minutes into their run, to start coughing blood.\nSakura has to drop Shikamaru and pick Sasuke up instead, because if he thought coughing blood was bad, he never needed to figure out how it felt to cough blood  after  a punch from Tsunade had shattered your everything.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMinato gets Hizashi as requested. Hiashi, whose Byakugan range is even better than Hizashi\u2019s, had been given his own team - but Hizashi\u2019s range isn\u2019t far behind, and that\u2019s why Minato asked for him.\nHe gets Kakashi, too, which Minato is relieved by. Not only was the ten year old (and didn\u2019t that hurt to think about? He was only  ten  and had seen so much war) very skilled and a huge benefit in combat, but he also really, really needed to get out of Konoha.\nThe kid was killing himself out of guilt, and being away from Obito definitely helped. It was obvious the first day of their journey.\nHe also gets Saiga, the current head of the Inuzuka family - which meant that they are officially the power team.\nIf any other team found the group, they\u2019d be the ones called in to back them up.\nSo of course, it figures that they\u2019d be the ones to run into them, and more than one of them at that.\n\u201cI see them.\u201d Hizashi announces two weeks into their journey, and Minato immediately feels cold all over. This is it, he thinks grimly, mentally preparing himself. \u201cSomething\u2019s... \u201c Hizashi pauses, shooting him a furtive look over his shoulder, and Minato frowns at him questioningly.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of them is a jinchuuriki.\u201d Hizashi announces flatly.\nMinato\u2019s brain stalls at that and everyone freezes, exchanging quick, severe glances. \u201cOne?\u201d Minato repeats after a brief second for recovery. \u2018Them\u2019, he\u2019d said. Plural. That wasn\u2019t good news. \u201cHow many of them are there?\u201d\nHizashi glances at him again, grimly this time. \u201cThere\u2019re four. Two kilometers away.\u201d\n Fuck. \u201cEveryone drop. Shikana.\u201d Minato looks sharply at the Nara in question, who glances over at him before quickly ducking under a tree branch. \u201cSend out the signal.\u201d\nThey pause on the next tree branch, Hizashi keeping his gaze pointed ahead, and Shikana falls into a crouch. She only takes a moment to pull out the transmitter, broadcasting a series of clicks to the other teams. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait, Minato.\u201d Hizashi announces grimly. \u201cThey\u2019re picking up speed.\u201d\n\u201cA sensor of their own?\u201d Genba Uchiha asks grimly, setting a hand on the katana at his hip. \u201cThis isn\u2019t looking good.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d Minato agrees warily.\n\u201cThree well known to be incredibly strong and an unknown, yet to be seen fourth?\u201d Kakashi shakes his head, grimacing under his mask. \u201cThis is a trap.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sure.\u201d Saiga grunts, reaching out to set a hand on his dog\u2019s head. \u201cI smell blood. Even from here, and that means there\u2019s a good amount of it. We should hit them now - if they\u2019re wounded, we might not get another opportunity like this.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t be able to sense them for much further.\u201d\nMinato curses under his breath. \u201cAlright. Shikana?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d She says, even as she taps a few more clicks - but she rises a moment later, stuffing the transmitter back into the bag on her back.\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving, now. Attack formation. Kakashi, Hizashi, Genba, you\u2019re up front with me.\u201d Minato barks, and flies off the branch. The others are right at his side, almost perfectly in time, and that much, at least, is a relief. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to assume they have a sensor. That means no hesitation. We don\u2019t stop until we\u2019re attacking them. Genba, Kakashi, go for the one with the black hair. Shikana, pin down the girl. Saiga, stick with me. We\u2019ll strike the fourth and assess his skill set - he\u2019s a completely unknown to us now. The rest of you, focus down the blonde. He\u2019s apparently the leader, so be prepared.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve stopped.\u201d Hizashi warns sharply and Minato shakes his head with a grimace.\nDefinitely a sensor, then. \u201cStick with the plan.\u201d He barks, and they break into a small clearing a minute later.\nIt\u2019s instantly obvious that their planning is for nothing.\nThe three of them are standing in a half circle, the blonde glowing a radiant gold and holding a long, thin black staff at the ready on one side. The woman\u2019s in the middle and front, her katana lifted and her eyes narrowed dangerously, and the Sharingan wielder is at the other end, his own sword at the ready.\nThey leap out all as one, three breaking to each side to flank while Minato and Hizashi come at them from head on. Three-pronged kunai rain down at them, but the golden glow around Naruto lashes out like a tail to swipe them away from the ground.\n\u201cNow!\u201d Sakura shouts sharply, and the second their feet touch the ground, they freeze.\nInvoluntarily, of course. There\u2019s a brief sensation of something darting up his body, and then there\u2019s a hand very lightly around his neck - but there\u2019s nothing there. Minato can only blink hard and shift his eyes around to glance at his fellows, unable to turn his neck to see them better.\nShadowy hands have gripped them all by their throats, and not one of them can move.\n\u201cShit.\u201d Sasuke puffs out, doubling forward a little bit, and his katana drops until the tip is against the grass. Sakura twists towards him, one hand settling on his sternum supportively and the other rubbing his back. He coughs in response, hard and wet, and there\u2019s the blood Saiga smelled.\nIt comes out of him with every hacking cough and splattering to the ground, and when it\u2019s finally over, Sasuke grabs the hem of his cloak and lifts it with a shaky hand to swipe at his mouth. \u201cWe\u2019re out of time here.\u201d Sakura says severely, turning her head towards Naruto, but her eyes lock on Minato and refuse to leave him.\nIt\u2019s smart.\nShe clearly understands that if anyone\u2019s going to break free, it\u2019s going to be him. All he needs is to move just a little and he can  hiraishin  free to any of the kunai on the ground around them.\nNaruto shoots her an agonized look. \u201cWhat do we do, Sakura? I won\u2019t ask you to leave-\u201d\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t.\u201d Sakura cuts him off, shaking her head, and Minato watches the interaction darkly. Her eyes narrow dangerously, expression twisted with angry grief and just a hint of panic, and he can  see  how frantically her mind is working. \u201cWe need a second to brainstorm.\u201d Sakura informs Naruto, who immediately steps backwards.\nMinato sees Shikana and Saiga\u2019s eyes widen, but doesn\u2019t understand why until Sakura steps back and crouches next to the man they\u2019d previously been bodily shielding from sight. It isn\u2019t just any man, and suddenly many things make much more sense all at once.\nIt\u2019s a Nara crouching there, making the Clan hand sign as his shadow stretches out eight different ways to catch each and every one of theirs. Impossible, is Minato\u2019s first thought, followed immediately by,  Just who are these people?\nEven Shikaku, who Minato has known his entire life and who was undeniably the fastest of his Clan, can\u2019t catch Minato\u2019s shadow when he\u2019s fighting seriously. Even  Shikaku  can\u2019t.\nAnd this kid isn\u2019t Shikaku, but he looks alarmingly close. He\u2019s almost identical, but his eyes are a little narrower, and he has no scars or goatee - but he\u2019s  too similar, and alarm bells were going off in Minato\u2019s head.\nWhat the hell did it all mean?\nThe inexplicable paralysis during their past assaults (and, arguably, rescues) had been his doing, no doubt. But how had no one heard of his presence before now?\nSakura and the Nara are whispering rapidly to one another, occasionally one of them shaking their heads, and Minato can\u2019t make out anything so he redirects his attention to the other two. The possible Uchiha.\nJiraiya\u2019s description of the man wasn\u2019t wrong, is the strange thing. His left eye is carefully covered by his hair, but his right eye is the typical Uchiha black. His face, his coloring, it all screams Uchiha just as much as the Nara\u2019s screams\u2026 well, Nara. In fact, he reminds Minato strongly of Mikoto, Fugaku\u2019s wife and Kushina\u2019s friend. Naruto, on the other hand\u2026\nNaruto looks somewhat like him, actually, from what little of him Minato can actually see through the bright glow surrounding him. His hair and his eyes, really, are almost the same as Minato\u2019s own. Spiky yellow and bright blue, respectively. The shape of his face, though, is much rounder - and the weird little lines on each cheek are definitely different from his own face.\nOn their own, the similarities aren\u2019t terribly remarkable, but for all three of them to look like Konoha\u2019s elite shinobi is suspicious at  best.\nBut Sakura speaks up before he can consider that much further. \u201cNaruto. If we leave him behind, can you carry us the rest of the way?\u201d She asks tightly, lips pressed hard together, and Naruto looks stricken.\nIt takes him a moment to answer. \u201cI- It\u2019ll still be too draining, probably.\u201d Naruto grimaces, shaking his head. \u201cWith Sasuke all fucked up-\u201d\n\u201cShut up, dobe.\u201d Sasuke mutters halfheartedly.\n\u201c-we\u2019re really going to be pretty much relying on my strength. I know I make it look easy, but this crap is pretty draining.\u201d Naruto admits, shaking his staff pointedly for some reason.\nSakura presses her lips even harder together, glancing sideways at the Nara, who looks back at her grimly.\n\u201c...There\u2019s no choice then.\u201d Sakura says tightly, and then stands up and pulls Naruto into a tight hug. She must whisper something to him, because when she pulls back a moment later, Naruto\u2019s looking at her warily.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Sakura confirms with a nod. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\u201cOh, totally.\u201d Naruto snorts softly, a tiny, sad smile tugging at his lips.\n\u201cGo on, get out of here. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She shoos him.\n\u201cSakura,\u201d Sasuke starts, and whatever\u2019s on his face makes her smile at him sadly. He twists his katana around and slides it smoothly into a sheathe under his cloak, then reaches out to tap Sakura on the center of her forehead. Her entire expression softens, so much so that Minato, being held  captive,\u00a0still manages to feel like he\u2019s intruding on something. \u201cDon\u2019t take too long.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\nNaruto pulls her into another quick hug, Sasuke stepping away and glaring slowly at each and every one of the shinobi. \u201cI love you.\u201d Naruto says urgently, then steps up to Sasuke\u2019s side.\n\u201cI know. I love you both, too. Get out of here.\u201d Sakura commands, and Naruto hesitates for a moment, staring directly at Minato.\nThere\u2019s a weird expression on his face that Minato can\u2019t identify. Wistfulness, perhaps, but not quite - and that doesn\u2019t make sense, anyways.\nBut before he can try to work it out, Naruto drops his staff.\nHis staff, which smoothly spreads out into a flat, black disc that the two of them step onto.\nAnd then  fly away on it,  far faster than even Minato can run. Hizashi makes a soft noise in the back of his throat, and the shadows tighten ever so slightly.\nSakura exhales a heavy breath and throws her sword out at Minato, and it lands quietly in the grass at his feet.\nAh.\nHe understands. They\u2019re surrendering. They won\u2019t fight, but they won\u2019t let them go, either, which means they\u2019re buying time for their comrades escape. Sakura crouches down next to the Nara but keeps her eyes locked on Minato, narrowed and hard. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d Sakura says quietly, lifting a hand to make a seal. \u201cKai.\u201d\nChakra  floods  the valley, so much of it so suddenly that it makes Minato feel like he\u2019s been punched in the chest. The skin around Sakura\u2019s forehead flashes purple for a second, and then thick black lines dart out and wrap around her body. She presses her hand to the Nara\u2019s shoulders and the black lines wrap over him, as well.\nSuddenly, he can barely even move his  eyes  anymore.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Sakura offer lamely, her gaze still locked on him. \u201cBelieve it or not, I actually quite like Konoha. It\u2019s just that some things are more important than a half dozen shinobi.\u201d She grimaces softly. \u201cAnd we\u2019re running very short on time.\u201d\nSilence - eerie, uncomfortable, forced silence - fills the valley for several minutes before she break it again. \u201cWe aren\u2019t bad people, believe it or not. I understand your perception of us, and I want to reassure you - none of the jinchuuriki have been harmed. All of them came willingly, except for Yugito I suppose, but she\u2019s remained with us of her own choice, as well.\u201d\nMinato wants to argue. Wants to yell that Killer B, for all his flaws, would never leave his brother\u2019s side in the middle of a dangerous war. He wants to yell that the Kiri jinchuuriki was only  seven , far too young to know what he\u2019s doing.\nBut he can\u2019t. He can\u2019t even control how fast he\u2019s breathing.\n\u201cWe were never going to come for her.\u201d Sakura says, and Minato feels the blood drain from his face. Kushina\u2019s status was a secret even in Konoha\u2019s own walls - a  very well kept one. The fact that she even knew it was completely  insane. \u201cThis is all unnecessary, really.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t complain, you aren\u2019t even doing the work.\u201d The Nara says tightly, a bead of sweat running down his face, and Sakura rolls her eyes.\n\u201cShut up, sweetie, I\u2019m monologuing.\u201d\n\u201cSince when do we monologue?\u201d\n\u201cSince we became the villains.\u201d Sakura huffs in exasperation, her gaze never leaving Minato. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll figure it out, but you\u2019ll never grasp the scope of what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Sakura informs Minato, matter of factly. \u201cAssuming the tales do you justice, you\u2019re too damned smart not to put it together eventually. So let me make this clear now, and try to remember it when the time comes.\u201d Sakura pauses for a moment, eyes narrowed and lips pressed together severely. \u201cWe chose this path, and we knew what would happen when we did. We forgive you, and everyone else involved.\u201d\n They  forgive  him? The more she talks, the more worried he gets. She\u2019s clearly\u2026 deranged, he supposes. Delusional, at  best. He wishes he could speak, but he can\u2019t so he silently watches her and she silently watches him.\nIt doesn\u2019t last too much longer. Sakura\u2019s head snaps up after five minutes, staring high above and past Minato\u2019s head, and she makes a soft sound of displeasure. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d She warns, lifting her hand to make the sign again. \u201cWe surrender.\u201d Sakura informs them, the black lines draining away back towards her forehead. She kneels down then, folding her hands behind her back, and bows her head low.\nThe shadows hold for a brief moment longer before the Nara breaks the jutsu and does the same. Shikana wastes no time in grabbing their shadows, imitating their positions with a tight frown. Hizashi looks towards Minato with barely controlled fury. \u201cOne of the two was the jinchuuriki.\u201d He murmurs to the man, about half a second before Jiraiya crashes into the valley atop Gamabunta.\n\u201cMinato! What the hell happened?\u201d Jiraiya demands, hopping down and landing in front of him - the rest of his team following suit. \u201cYou went radio silent.\u201d\nMinato makes a soft sound of acknowledgement, barely controlling his own anger - and a bit of embarrassment, too - as he gestures vaguely towards Sakura and the mystery Nara. \u201cTag them!\u201d Minato barks sharply. Kakashi and Genba step forward to do just that, putting an extra chakra dampener on Sakura for good measure. The woman wrinkles her nose but doesn\u2019t protest, even when Hizashi strides over to begin studiously and not-so-gently closing her tenketsu. \u201cThey got the better of us. He\u2019s a Nara, and a strong one.\u201d Minato murmurs to Jiraiya, who sends him an incredulous look at that.\n\u201cI know. I\u2019d say it was a rookie mistake, except that we had no idea he was even with them until we arrived.\u201d Minato half-hisses, the white-haired man lifting his hands a bit in surrender.\n\u201cCalm down. I know you aren\u2019t incompetent, kid.\u201d Jiraiya huffs softly, and movement from the corner of his eyes has Minato glancing over to see Sakura staring at them intently. Jiraiya follows his gaze and twitches slightly. \u201c...Freaky stare, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cA little bit.\u201d Minato grunts in acknowledgement. \u201cThe Nara held us all for the last twenty minutes. She\u2019s completely insane - no less than four in the interrogation room with her.\u201d Minato warns and Jiraiya\u2019s eyebrows shoot up before he nods.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it. She looks\u2026\u201d Jiraiya pauses, tilting his head and squinting a bit. Minato\u2019s halfway to bracing himself for some lewd comment, and so he really doesn\u2019t expect the way the blood suddenly drains from Jiraiya\u2019s face and the man rushes forward.\nMinato turns in surprise to see him already in front of Sakura, crouching down and grabbing her hard by her chin, jerking her face up close. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Minato demands in alarm, stepping over to his side, and that\u2019s when he sees it.\nHer hair had fallen in front of her face when she\u2019d knelt, but Jiraiya\u2019s manhandling had brushed it away, exposing the all-too-distinctive purple diamond on her forehead.\nThe woman bares her teeth in a mockery of a smile, and were he any less confident in his skills and the chakra seals, it\u2019s probably freak even him out a little. \u201cWhere the hell did you get that mark, Akashi?\u201d Jiraiya demands, shaking her head a little bit. Minato takes a quick step back to give him more space, and Hizashi, in the middle of sealing the Nara\u2019s tenketsu, does the same. He drags the Nara with him, Shikana\u2019s shadows stretching to accommodate the adjustment, and stops several feet away.\nMinato notices that he purposefully angles the Nara so he has a nice view of Jiraiya\u2019s mini-interrogation.\n\u201cWhere do you think, Jiraiya-sama?\u201d Sakura, the woman with no self preservation, asks lightly. The Nara seems to agree with Minato\u2019s assessment, because he jerks slightly again Hizashi\u2019s hold.\n\u201cSakura! Don\u2019t-\u201d He breaks off with a hiss, turning his head away from the sight of Jiraiya punching Sakura in the side of her face.\n\u201cWhere did you learn that seal?\u201d Jiraiya half-roars.\nMaybe it was the punch, but more likely it was the Nara\u2019s shout, because Sakura looks at the Nara with narrowed eyes and goes completely silent. Jiraiya lifts her by her shoulders and gives her a good shake, but she doesn\u2019t make a sound, not even a grunt, so he drops her and whips around to face Minato.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get a Yamanaka on her.\u201d Minato says preemptively and Jiraiya closes his mouth for a split second, nodding.\n\u201cDo it. I was Inoichi on it. This is bad, Minato, you have no idea - and get another seal on her!\u201d Jiraiya barks the last part to the group as a whole, and one of his people jerks forward to do just that.  This  time it gets a reaction, with the third seal leaving her doubled over and struggling to catch her breath.\nIt\u2019s probably dangerous to leave her chakra so low, but frankly, Minato\u2019s not feeling too sympathetic of her plight.\n\u201cCan you take our teams back, Minato?\u201d Jiraiya asks urgently, stepping over to him, and he shakes his head.\n\u201cNo - but Hizashi can lead them.\u201d Minato looks to the Hyuuga for confirmation.\n\u201cYes, taicho. I can manage both groups.\u201d Hizashi bows his head slightly.\n\u201cTell Sarutobi. I\u2019ll be back once I find her.\u201d\n\u201cI will. Good luck, sensei.\u201d Minato says quietly to Jiraiya. The man pauses only long enough to clap Minato once on the shoulder, then leaps back up onto the toad and vanishes in a puff of smoke.\nMinato exhales a hard breath and steps forward, grabbing the back collar of Sakura\u2019s dress and dragging her over to the Nara, who watches with narrowed, furious eyes and a tightly clenched jaw. \u201cI\u2019ll take them back. Stay safe, Hizashi.\u201d\n\u201cWe will, taicho.\u201d Hizashi promises, stepping away from the Nara once Minato\u2019s got a grip on the man\u2019s shinobi-issue shirt.\nThen he finds the furthest seal, flares his chakra, and is there moments later. Sakura gives a sharp, hitching breath, and Minato allows himself to feel a tiny bit of juvenile smugness before he  hiraishin\u2019s  them again.\nThis time he pauses just long enough for her to finish vomiting before he gives one last  hiraishin, directly into T&amp;I.\nThere\u2019s a moment of startled clatters and hastily drawn weapons before the interrogators recognize him and relax. \u201cDamn, Minato, why do you always do that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s secure.\u201d Minato answers Inoichi blandly, dragging the pink-haired woman in front of him and pointedly raising an eyebrow. \u201cThis one\u2019s for you to handle personally. Show me to a room and we\u2019ll discuss it - and no less than four interrogators in with each of them at a time, got it?\u201d\n\u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d Inoichi sighs heavily but nods. \u201cAyame, Tetsu, and Jiro, with me. Haruna, you can handle the\u2026\u201d Inoichi pauses, finally noticing the Nara\u2019s face, and Minato can  see  the gears working behind his eyes. It takes him a moment to figure out how to respond, which he does by pointing at the man. \u201cHandle this one.\u201d Inoichi says in an utterly flat voice.\nHaruna, who is\u2026 apparently the same Yamanaka who was handling Obito, Minato recognizes belatedly, steps forward to grab the man from him.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Inoichi tells Minato, jerking his chin towards one of the many hallways connected to the large office space, and Minato drags Sakura along behind them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSasuke glares at the Juubi statue as he and Naruto return to the cave.\nThere\u2019s a moment of complete silence when the jinchuuriki catch sight of them.\n\u201c...Where are Sakura and Shikamaru?\u201d Roshi is the one to ask and Sasuke clenches his hands into fists.\nIf only he hadn\u2019t had an attack. If only he\u2019d been able to  breathe  properly. They would\u2019ve been  fine, but they left to hunt down the last of the White Zetsus, and he\u2019d-\nOne of them hit him in the damn chest.\n\u201cKonoha\u2019s got them, but it\u2019s fine - it doesn\u2019t affect our plans.\u201d Naruto says firmly and confidently, like their best and second closest friends weren\u2019t currently being held by T&amp;I.\nLike he didn\u2019t know damn well they\u2019d never see Shikamaru again, all because Sasuke\u2019s lungs were  assholes.\n\u201cSakura has the Rinnegan with her, safe. They\u2019ll never know where to find it.\u201d Naruto adds reassuringly, looking past them all and at the statue, two of it\u2019s eyes wide open and eternally staring, and Sasuke resists the urge to punch the wall.\nHe\u2019d only break his hand, and no one was around to heal it anymore.\n Fuck.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Yugito asks cautiously, too wary and too smart for someone only ten years old, and that\u2019s probably why Sasuke feels the need to avoid her like the plague.\nToo much like him at that age, except her pent up fury is directed at anyone Killer B tells her in an enemy instead of at Itachi.\nWho hadn\u2019t even even been an enemy to begin with, god damn it.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sure.\u201d Sasuke bites out and refuses to look at anyone\u2019s reaction to his too-sharp tone.\nShe\u2019s only ten, Sasuke reminds himself.\nSakura would\u2019ve punched him for snapping like that.\n Damn it.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sure.\u201d Naruto echoes his words with more confidence and generally less assholery, and Sasuke breathes slowly through his nose. \u201cI\u2019ve got a chakra sensor on me. Once she feels the Juubi, I\u2019ll hit myself with this thing and she\u2019ll be able to come right to us.\u201d\n\u201cGood. When will we begin?\u201d Han asks curtly.\nNaruto takes a deep breath, looking at the Juubi statue grimly. \u201cNow. B - you\u2019ve got the best relationship with your bijuu. Best chances of resisting if it gets greedy. You willing to go first?\u201d\n\u201cHah! If that\u2019s a question that needs asking, get ready to start basking. No hesitation.\u201d B reassures with a confident grin, and then adds slyly, \u201ccause I\u2019m not from the  Fire  nation.\u201d\nAs usual, it takes Naruto a moment to identify the insult there.\n\u201cHey!\u201d He protests loudly, but it\u2019s too late, and B\u2019s already ignoring him in favor of reaching out and poking the Juubi.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nInoichi spends about fifteen minutes in her head before he has to step out, meeting Sarutobi and Minato in the observation booth with a slightly dazed expression. \u201cShe is completely and entirely insane.\u201d Inoichi informs them, sitting down and rubbing his forehead. \u201cCompletely. And she\u2019s weaponized it. I just got mentally pummeled by a personality fragment that took on the form of a very violent eleven year old girl.\u201d\n\u201c...Seriously?\u201d Minato asks incredulously, looking between Inoichi and the girl in the interrogation room.\nThe girl who is casually picking at her nails, not even seeming to notice the four shinobi in the room with her. \u201cSeriously. There are three of them, if you were wondering.  That  one, the eleven year old girl, and a seventeen year old girl, too.\u201d Inoichi pauses for a moment. \u201cStrangely enough, it\u2019s actually the teenage one that\u2019s the nice one.\u201d\n\u201cDid you learn anything?\u201d Sarutobi asks the important question while Minato still tries to wrap his mind around the three-personality thing.\n\u201cSome. Not much. She\u2019s a medic-nin, and a damn good one, going by what little I could get my hands on. From what I can see, Tsunade taught her willingly.\u201d\nThat\u2026\n...That doesn\u2019t sound right at all, and Minato glances quickly at Sarutobi to see that he\u2019s definitely on the same page.\n\u201cAre you certain they were true memories?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Which makes things stranger. I was only able to get flickers. Tiny, brief fragments. Long enough to tell they\u2019re real, but too short to get much information. She\u2019s been through hell, from what little I saw.\u201d Inoichi informs them with a dark frown, glancing out and through the one-way glass window. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her punched through the chest, have limbs chopped off - one flicker she even got bisected and had to drag herself back to her lower half.\u201d Inoichi shudders at that and Minato suppresses the urge to do so himself. \u201cI saw her with her hand wrapped around the heart of her teammate, manually keeping it pumping for him. There were\u2026  thousands  of bodies around them.\u201d\nMinato frowns in confusion at that. \u201cThousands?\u201d He repeats dubiously, glancing at Sarutobi. \u201cShe can\u2019t be older than twenty five. There\u2019s no way she lived through the Second war.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Inoichi confirms, shaking his head, but he doesn\u2019t offer anything else for a long moment. \u201cIf I had to hazard a guess, from what little I saw, it was in the Land of Lightning.\u201d\nThat made even  less  sense. \u201cKumo hasn\u2019t had any deaths on a large scale like that.\u201d\n\u201cNo, they haven\u2019t.\u201d Inoichi offers a small shrug, clearly at a loss and just as concerned as them about it. \u201cAll I know is, the memory was real. Wherever she came from, she\u2019s been through hell. For her mind to have fractured that young, something pretty damn bad must\u2019ve happened. Most kids don\u2019t break like that at tragedy. Even when it\u2019s bad, kids are more resilient than we are. That, or\u2026 she had some underlying mental disorder. I didn\u2019t have much time to look around, between avoiding a sociopathic eleven year old and a crying seventeen year old.\u201d\n\u201cCrying.\u201d Minato echoes, looking back at the woman.\nShe\u2019s moved on from examining her nails and has decided to climb up onto the table, where she\u2019s now laying with her back to them.\nInoichi pauses to frown at her as well, blinking. \u201c...She must have one hell of a chakra supply to still be able to move around like that.\u201d\n\u201cNo kidding. Uzumaki blood at work, I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cWere you able to discern anything about her lineage?\u201d Sarutobi asks. \u201cOr that of her comrades?\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, no. She doesn\u2019t seem to have very many memories of her parents - they were shinobi, I gather. Her comrades\u2026 the blonde you described, with the whiskers, he\u2019s the one whose heart she was beating for him. The black haired Sharingan user, I\u2019m not sure about. Her other teammate was a similar looking Uchiha, though, and he\u2019s the one who put his hand through her chest.\u201d\n Yikes. Minato shudders a little at that. \u201cThey seemed pretty cozy when we ran into them.\u201d And were promptly, with shameful ease, captured and held by the enemy. \u201cThe blonde was alive and well, too.\u201d\n\u201cHmph. Well, I\u2019m going in for round two if you want to check in on the Nara-wannabe. Do me a favor and stop by to send the secretary out for some migraine medication, her brain is an asshole.\u201d\nFits right in with the rest of her, then, Minato couldn\u2019t help but think unpleasantly as Inoichi headed back into the interrogation room. \u201cGo look in on him, Minato. Perhaps they\u2019re having better luck with his mind.\u201d\nThey were, in fact,  not  having better luck.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a steel trap.\u201d Haruna groans three hours later, alternating between chugging coffee and gagging on it. \u201cI tried everything. His brain doesn\u2019t budge, not a single bit. Three hours of attacking it relentlessly and the man didn\u2019t even  twitch. All I got was a constant, never ending swarm of rapid fire thoughts being pummeled into my skull too quickly for me to understand any of it, and if I went any further into that damn maze he built in his brain, I\u2019d never get back out.\u201d\nInoichi\u2019s luck doesn\u2019t get any better, either.\n\u201cIt took me an hour to even figure it out, is the most irritating part.\u201d Inoichi confides in Minato as he waits for his migraine medication to kick in, an ice pack around the back of his head. \u201cShe sends me random little tidbits of information while her psychopathic child side chases me around murderously - but the second I try to approach the sad alter ego, or the second I get too close to  something  of substance, I get completely shut down.  Completely, Minato. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d Inoichi shakes his head, looking more troubled than distressed. \u201cShe\u2019s good, Minato. She\u2019s a  genius, which makes it even worse.\u201d\n\u201cThe Nara apparently is as well.\u201d Minato sighs tiredly, exhausted.\n\u201cHer chakra control is off the charts, Minato.\u201d Inoichi says grimly, making him look up in concern. \u201cOff the charts, and I really mean that. I think we overestimated her chakra reserves. I think if she had any less control, having three seals on her would\u2019ve killed her. I  genuinely  believe that she is redirecting her chakra around the seals, and that she\u2019s doing it consciously, constantly, and  while fending me off.\u201d\nThat\u2019s\u2026\nInsane. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think that me being called a genius is offensive to our villainous quartet.\u201d Minato confides, which makes Inoichi snort loudly.\n\u201cI know, right? Goddamn.\u201d He shakes his head in dismay. \u201cOnce this medication kicks in, I\u2019ll go back for round two. I want to try taking one of the seals off and going after the crying personality fragment.\u201d\nMinato frowns immediately at that. \u201cWhy remove a tag?\u201d He asks cautiously and Inoichi offers a faint shrug.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping if she doesn\u2019t have to focus so hard on maintaining her chakra control, she\u2019ll slip up and I\u2019ll get close enough to get a few solid memories. I\u2019ve seen fragments like the crying one before - usually they form in wartimes like now.\u201d Inoichi explains, waving a hand vaguely, and Minato tilts his head slightly at the man. \u201cYou know how they have an entire Academy course on absolutely  not  suppressing grief and anger, but instead redirecting those emotions into \u2018healthier\u2019 methods of expression?\u201d\nBy which he meant they taught them to use those emotions to kill more efficiently, empowering without overwhelming. \u201cI remember.\u201d Minato confirms and Inoichi huffs, jabbing a thumb at the window Sakura\u2019s still on the other side of, now  really  asleep. He thinks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s  why you don\u2019t suppress them. You end up fucking something up somewhere. The only reason she hasn\u2019t had a complete mental breakdown externally is because her mind is having the breakdown internally instead. It fractured, so now those pent up emotions are so intense they\u2019ve basically formed their own personality. I guarantee if I can get close to it, I\u2019ll have some solid answers for us.\u201d\nMinato hesitates for a long minute more before he reluctantly nods.\n\u201cDo it.\u201d He agrees and Inoichi nods, but makes no attempt to move just yet.\n\u201cI will, just as soon as the me-\u201d\nAnd then they feel it.\nIt\u2019s faint, but the rush of malevolent chakra is still harsh enough to make his hair stand on edge. Minato turns towards it automatically, bracing himself to  hiraishin  towards the mystery chakra, and promptly freezes.\nBecause Sakura\u2019s moving too, jerking suddenly to her feet and ripping the chains off her wrists like they were made of paper instead of metal. The seals  burn  off her skin, and Sakura slams her heel to the floor before the shinobi can do more than reach for their weapons. The floor  explodes.\nTime is of the essence, so Minato leaps straight into and shatters the observation window, throwing himself into the dust-filled room. There\u2019s another crash, almost instantly following the first, and the wall between her room and the Nara\u2019s is abruptly nonexistent. \u201cYou took your time.\u201d The Nara says dryly as Minato chases her into the room, catching sight of her just before she uses a single finger to break the chains holding the Nara\u2019s wrists. Both of them jerk around sharply to look at him.\nHe throws a kunai at the woman\u2019s head and  hiraishin\u2019s  to it before the Nara can do anything. He reappears right over the ducking woman, and twists to slam a  rasengan dead center into her spine.\nSakura gives a small gasp, followed by a sharp,  \u201cKai! \u201d And the room fills with stifling chakra.\nMinato twists, grabbing the nearest seal, and teleports to the wall where his kunai had ultimately landed. He instantly pushes back off the wall, launching himself in a twisting move over the Nara\u2019s head, and stabs down with another kunai. It buries into the woman\u2019s shoulder blade even as she twists around, expression more irritated than pained, and her hand wraps around his wrist.\nHe reaches for the seal against her shoulder.\nAnd then her fist slams into his chest and he\u2019s in a world of pain so extreme it takes his breath - and for a moment, his vision - away.\nHe tugs on the seal anyways, and reappears just behind her head, already stabbing down with another kunai-\nAnd he freezes, the tip of his kunai a bare centimeter from the back of her skull.\nThe mystery Nara, to add absolute insult to injury, has to be the fastest Nara ever, because that was almost instantaneous.\n\u201cHoly  fuck,\u201d Sakura breathes out, turning around and looking at him with wide eyes and a pale complexion. \u201cHoly  shit, did you fucking see that? Because I  didn\u2019t  see that, oh my god.\u201d Sakura gives a hysterical, breathless laugh, looking helplessly at the Nara, who stares at Minato with dangerously narrowed eyes.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019m as fast as I am, Sakura.\u201d He grits out, a bead of sweat already forming at his temple as he struggles to hold Minato in place.\n Good, Minato thinks angrily, continuing to struggle as hard as he can, but he can barely even move his eyes now.\nAgain.\nHe\u2019s really starting to hate this Nara.\n\u201cI almost died.\u201d Sakura says, stunned, and the Nara huffs out a heavy breath.\n\u201cFocus. You need to go.\u201d The man says with dark urgency.\nDamn it.\nThe malicious chakra is still there, not growing but not fading, and Sakura looks in it\u2019s direction with a sobering expression. After a short moment, she turns to the Nara again. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you.\u201d\n\u201cLittle low on options, Kura.\u201d The Nara says tightly. \u201cI can\u2019t hold him. Get out of here.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Sakura argues weakly, turning her back to Minato so she can face the Nara fully, and the damage his  rasengan had done is gone. Only the tattered hole in the back of her dress attests to him having even hit her.\nSeriously. That\u2019s just  infuriating. \n\u201cSo? We pretty much came here to die anyways.  You\u2019re  about to die.\u201d The Nara points out with a careless shrug that Minato unwillingly imitates.\n\u201cI-\u201d Sakura breaks of with a soft sound of protest, and Minato glares at them as hard as he can, waiting for spontaneous death beams to sear them into dust. \u201cWe were going to go together.\u201d Sakura says quietly, in a miserable tone that doesn\u2019t fit her character at all.\n\u201cI know.\u201d The Nara says just as softly, turning his head - and Minato\u2019s - towards her. \u201cI love you.\u201d\nSakura takes a deep, shuddering breath, and nods sharply. \u201cI love you too.\u201d She says firmly, her voice only trembling a little. \u201cSee you on the other side.\u201d\nThe Nara flashes her a quick grin and then she\u2019s gone.\nHer shunshin is almost as fast as his, damn it.\nHe\u2019s really starting to feel like anyone who ever called him a prodigy or genius were  liars.\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad.\u201d The Nara says, shrugging their shoulders as one. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty much inhuman, really. And basically immortal to boot.\u201d Nara pauses then, then gives a vaguely thoughtful hum. \u201cThough I guess this time it might actually stick.\u201d Nara looks at him, then, meeting his gaze lazily but somehow severely. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have to do this, but, well. Looks like I\u2019m about to be the only one left, and I can\u2019t exactly let you guys get into my head. Wouldn\u2019t want you to undo our hard work. Do me a favor, though. When you figure it out? Don\u2019t tell Dad.\u201d\nBefore he can even try to figure out what the hell that\u2019s supposed to mean, the Nara lifts his hand (and Minato\u2019s) up in an eerily familiar sign.\n No,  Minato thinks desperately, because he\u2019s already damned confused as it is, he doesn\u2019t need to add even  more  to the pile of inexplicable bullshit these guys have thrown on them.\nBut the Nara is a complete bastard and says the very thing Minato hadn\u2019t wanted him to. \u201cFuinjutsu: Nouheki.\u201d  The Nara says, and then he  drops.\nMinato stumbles a little as he abruptly regains control, because his chest is on  fire  and he\u2019s pretty sure she broke at least four ribs with her punch. He takes a slow, careful breath, makes sure his lungs aren\u2019t going to be punctured, and then looks over at the Nara for a brief instant.\nBlood leaks out of his ears and his nose, and the man is completely, utterly still.\nMinato has no damn idea how the man knew the ANBU suicide jutsu - but he knows that any information the man might\u2019ve had is gone, now, lost to the careful destruction of his own mind.\n\u201cI hate you all.\u201d Minato informs his corpse, breathless and more exhausted than fervent at this point.\nHe\u2019s literally too used to this to actually be mad about it at this point, and isn\u2019t that just  sad?\nMinato takes a tired breath and leaves him there. Grim and confusing as the encounter was, he has more important things to do - like tracking down that chakra source.\n\u00a0\nBut no one ever does manage to find it, because it vanishes only eight minutes after appearing.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSakura could honestly, wholeheartedly say that until rather recently, she never expected herself to be in the position of ripping out her own eyeballs.\nBut by god, she does it.\nShe yanks them out, tosses them blindly (hah, obviously) and then sticks the Rinnegan eyes in their place. She\u2019d been smart about it, keeping the jar she\u2019d held them in in a small seal tattooed into her wrist. Sasuke had been the one to teach her how, having done much the same to his own arm before it got slightly obliterated during his fight with Naruto. No one found the seal, so no one confiscated the eyes with her little \u2018arrest\u2019.\nAnyways.\nPoint is, it was definitely one of the top ten weirdest positions Sakura\u2019s ever put herself in.\nLuckily, Sakura\u2019s damn good, and the entire process of removing, replacing, and reconnecting takes all of fifteen seconds, and she\u2019s got new working magic eyes in place before she can even come out of the shock of losing her first pair.\nAnd the magic eyes are pretty damned neat if she says so herself. Who knew?\nThe Juubi\u2019s chakra, distinctly evil and horribly familiar, flares in the far distance. It\u2019s isn\u2019t truly alive, not yet, she can tell that much easily enough - which means she\u2019s in time.\nSo Sakura takes a deep breath, releases her seal, and teleports way the hell away from the outskirts of Konoha long before anyone can catch up to her. She refuses to think about what she\u2019s leaving behind. She\u2019ll see him again soon enough, anyways.\nShe reappears almost on top of Naruto, and holy  shit  is that a huge chakra drain. She catches herself and staggers on the uneven ground of Madara\u2019s old cave, his cooked up body still stuffed in the far corner where Sasuke had left it, and yep, that\u2019s the Juubi, and Naruto\u2019s tangling with it.\nSasuke, on the other hand, is helping a seven-year old (and super adorable) Utakata to his feet, surrounded by the other jinchuuriki.\nGood.\nNone of them accidentally fed the Juubi too much and died, then. Always a plus, in Sakura\u2019s book.\nShe takes a deep breath and releases the Yin seal the rest of the way, fully activating the Strength of a Hundred. \u2018Her\u2019 eyes burn viciously at the flood of chakra but she ignores that for the moment, instead  shunshin\u2019ing to Sasuke\u2019s side and setting her hand on the back of his exposed neck. He grunts softly at the rush of chakra, crouching down to ready himself.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be any second now,\u201d Sakura warns the jinchuuriki, taking them all in one last time.\nHan and Roshi from Iwa, Yurata from Taki, B and Yugito from Kumo, and little Utakata from Kiri.\nHe was seven, and barely a child, but even he looked grim and determined as they all nodded and stepped in front of Sasuke.\nThey all knew what came next, and they were ready to do it anyways, even Utakata, whom Han had taken aside to explain things a little more thoroughly to.\nThey were all better people than their villages deserved.\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming!\u201d Naruto shouts as he blocks another one of the weak Juubi\u2019s swinging attacks, never letting any of them come close to the group. Most of it\u2019s eyes are only barely slitted, having gotten only a taste of the chakra from those bijuu - but two of them are spread wide. Shukaku, who had been sealed in that damn tea kettle from Suna, and Isobu, who had been sealed in a large urn when Sakura and Sasuke interrupted that little ritual.\n\u201cFive seconds, Sasuke!\u201d\nSasuke takes a deep, rattling breath and tenses under Sakura\u2019s hand. She reaches down with her other hand to pull his bangs behind his ear for him, freeing his sight.\n\u00a0\nThree.\n\u00a0\nTwo...\n\u00a0\nThe world distorts, and in the same second that Black Zetsu pops out of the ground, lured by the sensation of his \u2018mother\u2019 awakening, Sasuke teleports them all way the fuck away.\n All of them reappear in a frozen wasteland. \u201cGo!\u201d Sakura roars instantly, wasting no time on adjusting to the new dimension, and throws herself at the Juubi.\nBlack Zetsu  tries  to intervene, tries to go for Sakura and steal her Rinnegan and chakra so he could  really  bring back his \u2018mother\u2019.\nHe  tries. \nSasuke and Naruto get there first, and Black Zetsu screams in panicked fury as their hands touch him.\nSakura grabs the Juubi, frantically climbing up onto it\u2019s head, and the jinchuuriki throw themselves forward, grabbing whatever parts they can and pinning them down. They draw on their bijuu, just as Naruto had taught them to, and all six bijuu do everything they can to weigh the monster down.\nNaruto and Sasuke focus on\u00a0sealing Zetsu, and the jinchuuriki hold the Juubi back, preventing its attacks from interrupting the duo.\nThe six of them hold down the Juubi, and Sakura does her best to help, using the Rinnegan to  force the bijuu down, heavier and heavier until it can barely move it\u2019s tails at all. The jinchuuriki hold on tight, and they don\u2019t let go, even as the Juubi uses the contact to drain more and more of their bijuu from them.\nBy the time they\u2019re done with Zetsu, by the time Sasuke and Naruto can turn around and slam their palms onto the Juubi next, the jinchuuriki are dead and the Juubi\u2019s fully awake. Just in time for the earth to break apart underneath it, lifting the Juubi up in it\u2019s new, forming prison. The Juubi roars it's fury, it's body already starting to shrivel again, and the bijuu start to break free of it in streams of chakra.\nThe three of them won't be able to\u00a0leap away from the forming prison in\u00a0time. Sasuke's sick and Naruto's exhausted, the sealing taking more time - and Sakura gets weaker and weaker by the second, using the Rinnegan to keep the Juubi from retaliating.\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter.\nIt  doesn\u2019t matter, because they knew that going in, they were  prepared, goddamn it.\nThey  planned, and no one was going to die along with them. That meant taking on the Juubi alone, when taking it on with eighty thousand had ended in unimaginable death. The three (four, we were supposed to be four. Shikamaru... ) were strong. They were arguably the strongest shinobi to have ever come after Hashirama and Madara. But they were only three, and the Juubi could withstand eighty thousand. They knew from the beginning they wouldn\u2019t be coming out of it alive.\nBut if that was the price of changing the future, they weren\u2019t about to hesitate. They would die. Their bodies would be sealed with the Juubi\u2019s, that was unavoidable. Sasuke was too sick, Naruto too strained, and Sakura\u2026 well. Sakura was going to make  damn sure  they were the only ones to die, and that meant exhausting herself to death using the Rinnegan.\nSo the earth lifts them all up, and none of them try to jump away. They follow the plan.\nSakura activates the Rinnegan the rest of the way, and she  screams  at the horrible, agonizing rush of  not enough chakra, oh god, it burns so much how did he live like this, and forces it to obey her commands.\n\u00a0\nIt takes everything Sakura has left to reach into Limbo, to grab hold of the six, prematurely snuffed out lives, and to drag them back again.\n\u00a0\nIt takes everything Sasuke has left to open his eyes one last time and glare the ex-jinchuuriki back into their dimension.\n\u00a0\nIt takes everything Naruto has left to keep powering the seal on his own, because he\u2019s the only one left to.\n\n\nThe seal finishes, and the dimension suddenly gains itself a moon in the sky.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe bijuu, freed with the sealing of the statue, are left alone in an unknown dimension unlikely to ever be found again. But they\u2019re  free  again, and that makes it all worthwhile, as far as they care.\nThe ex-jinchuuriki wake up together, impossibly alive in spite of all odds, and try to find their new places in the world. B and Yugito return to Kumogakure, welcomed as heroes even if they don\u2019t have their bijuu anymore. They\u2019d been the \u2018best jinchuuriki\u2019, and they\u2019d be remembered for that always. It leaves a bitter taste in their mouths because they\u2019d bonded with their bijuu with Naruto\u2019s help. They befriended them, all of them, and they understood that none of them be B had been anything close to a \u2018good\u2019 jinchuuriki. But B and Yugito, they still have a home, they still have a life, so they endure.\nThe others aren\u2019t as lucky. The Iwa shinobi and Utakata refuse to return to their homes, where they had been brutalized and tormented for something that was inflicted upon them. They follow Naruto\u2019s advice posthumously and together they go to Amegakure, where Yahiko welcomes them with open arms.\nYurata, the Seven-Tails ex-jinchuuriki from Takigakure, joins them some months later after Jiraiya runs into him during his travels and points him their way.\nKushina\u2019s left the last jinchuuriki of this world, and though she doesn\u2019t know it, she\u2019s creating a bit of a paradox. When Naruto died, Kurama had reformed in that dimension alongside his fellow bijuu - and alternate dimension or no, that meant there were two Kurama\u2019s at one time. To solve this, when Kushina eventually passes at the ripe old age of a hundred and fifteen, Kurama won\u2019t reform in their dimension. Instead, he\u2019ll simply merge with the body of the alternate dimension Kurama.\nWith Sakura\u2019s body sealed, the Rinnegan is, yet again, lost forever from the world. And truly forever this time - the Senju clan that had once flourished was at the end of it\u2019s line, with its last strong-blooded member being Tsunade. The ability to combine enough Senju DNA with Uchiha DNA would die with her.\nWithout Obito twisted by Madara, without Black Zetsu there to spread discord, and without Danzo to handle said discord with the most extreme of extreme prejudice, the Uchiha Clan never does become ostracized by Konoha. The Massacre never happens. They still aren\u2019t the most humble clan, but they remain respected by Konoha at large, and they do their best to keep it that way.\nThe less peaceful version of the Akatsuki never forms, and thus, the seeds of the Fourth Shinobi World War never get planted. It doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s peace all across the board, but it most certainly helps enormously.\nIn fact, Konan and Yahiko take in Utakata as their own, in a world where she once would have been one of the ones to kill him.\nYagura, without ever becoming the host of the Sanbi, is overthrown at the end of Kiri\u2019s long civil war, five years earlier than he might have been. Mei becomes Mizukage five years earlier than she would have, and makes Zabuza - the Mizukage\u2019s successful assassin - her right hand man - with a young Haku as his loyal weapon., and it\u2019s that much easier for her to restore diplomatic relations with Kumo and Konoha, the countries bordering Kiri.\nIn Sunagakure, a certain boy is saved from ever having to become the hated, tormented host of Shukaku, and is carefully taught by his caring father how to control the Kekkei Genkai they share. Gaara, who would once have been known for his control of sand, is instead known for his control of iron, much like the Third Kazekage.\nNaruto Namikaze, who would have grown up alone, orphaned, and loathed, grows up with a loving family and a warm community surrounding him. While he\u2019ll never quite be the brightest crayon in the box, he\u2019s at least a happy one. He might not have the vast chakra reserves of Kurama this time around, but his Uzumaki lineage still keeps him far above average, and he still manages to regularly use some ridiculous jutsus.\n(He still graduates almost dead last and is teamed with Sasuke and Sakura, because some things never change, and that\u2019s how it should be.)\nAll in all, nearly a hundred thousand people would have died to the various events, sixty-five thousand of them in the Fourth War alone, that had ultimately been prevented.\nAnd maybe no one, not a single person in the entire world, will ever know what the four mysteriously appearing and equally mysteriously disappearing shinobi had saved them from - but they wouldn't mind that so much.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBecause, well\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat was the whole point of it, now wasn\u2019t it?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd in the meantime, Minato is the first to understand the mystery of the four impossibly strong and skilled shinobi.\nHis suspicion starts when Sakura Haruno is born to half-Uzumaki Kizashi Haruno and his wife, Mebuki. She has soft pink hair and, after the first two months, deep green eyes that grow slowly brighter and brighter. They stop at an eerily familiar shade and it puts him on edge, but the Hokage, while he\u2019s suspicious as is necessary for the job, doesn\u2019t jump to any conclusions.\nIt grows when Sasuke Uchiha is born, and he sees Itachi lightly tap the babe on his forehead, identical to how mystery-Sasuke had tapped Sakura\u2019s forehead.\nIt transforms from a vague suspicion to an actual theory when Shikamaru Nara is born and a proud Shikaku shows him a picture of himself as a babe. They were almost identical, and while Shikaku had the luxury of never meeting Mystery Nara face to face, all of a sudden, all Minato can think of is his dying words.  Don\u2019t tell Dad. \nThey echo in his head for weeks, guilt and anxiety clawing at his mind.\n We chose this path,  Sakura had said.  We knew what would happen when we did. We forgive you, and everyone else involved. \n Don\u2019t tell Dad,  the Nara had said.\nHe hesitates on naming his own child.\nIt terrifies him. If he\u2019d never met the mystery menace, he would\u2019ve jumped at the chance to name his son Naruto after Jiraiya\u2019s books. He doesn\u2019t tell Kushina this, even as she gets steadily more and more annoyed with him for his reluctance to choose a name. He just can\u2019t choose it. If his theory is right, then he is utterly terrified for his son. He doesn\u2019t  want  him to be Naruto. To be a man with bizarre powers who helps Sakura and Sasuke inflict the kind of damage they did on their people for some unknown reason.\nBut then he\u2019s born, and the three marks on each cheek are unmistakable and undeniable. His theory, as well, is now undeniable. \u201cNaruto,\u201d He decides after a long and arduous birth and reaffirmation of Kushina\u2019s seal. He stares down at his son\u2019s face, with spiked blonde hair and little whiskers, and there\u2019s no more denying. \u201cNaruto,\u201d he repeats, and finishes in his mind where no one else can possibly overhear it.\n You won\u2019t have to live the kind of life where you\u2019ll ever feel the need to do what your counterpart did. If they didn\u2019t already make sure of that, then I will, Minato vows firmly, running a fingertip down his marked cheeks, awed and shaken all in one.\nHis life must have been terrible, Minato thinks. All of their lives must have. For them to have felt the need to time travel, to take the bijuus, to kill Madara\u2026 Something must have happened. Something terrible. Or many terrible happenings, and they stopped all they could.\nEither way, Minato is both painfully grateful, and miserably frightened. If they stopped it\u2026 if they hadn\u2019t\u2026 there\u2019s no way for him to know.\nSo he\u2019ll focus on raising Naruto safe and happy.\nWith any luck, he\u2019ll go on to have such excellent teammates again - and they truly must have been, for them to have joined him in a move so drastic and insane.\n\u201cYou will be loved,\u201d Minato swears quietly enough that Kushina can\u2019t overhear and tease him for his sentimentality. \u201cYou  are  loved,\u201d He adds fiercely, and shoots Rin and Biwako an overwhelmingly grateful look for helping Kushina through such a hellish birth.\nIt\u2019s not every day you have to give birth in a cave, but Minato supposes he should just be thankful that the pink-haired menace hadn\u2019t returned solely to keep up the tradition of punching the damn cave open."
