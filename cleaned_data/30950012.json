    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSUNDAY\n\n\n\n\nIt was supposed to be a smooth mission; grab some documents for a recent murder case and leave.\nEven though it was a fairly simple task that one could manage alone, Dazai had insisted that the trio should work together so that Atsushi could watch them work and learn from the experience.\nNo one was supposed to be in the building, they had checked and analysed the schedules of the workers to avoid any type of contact.\nAnd yet, when Dazai took a step into the office, he was attacked.\nIt was a long-distance attack, meaning he didn't get a chance to nullify the ability of his opponent. He could have avoided it perfectly, the attack had been imprecise, sloppy and of an amateur, yet his body was too exhausted to react fast enough.\nThe result of a poor sleep pattern (more like none) had caused this. Dazai could count in one hand the total hours he had slept in three weeks and it had taken a toll on his body.\u00a0\nIt angered him. A lot had changed since his days in the mafia. Back then sometimes he was actually required to work without any sleep (thanks, Mori) as a form of punishment to worsen his mental state, but in the agency they never let him come to work if he hadn't slept. So he had grown accustomed to some kind of tiredness again.\nDazai was sent flying across the room and bumped into the shelve, books and papers falling on top of him.\nAtsushi and Kunikida quickly jumped into action and restrained their enemy, the blond rapidly realised from the mans glowing palms that he had shot his ability from his hands, so he tied them and wrapped them up with the nearest cloth he had found. When he finally got a glance at the opponent, he was taken back by how young the man looked, and yet he had still had managed to successfully land a powerful hit on the brunet.\n\"Dazai, get up here. I need you to help Atsushi and keep him stabilized\" Kunikida called, shuffling the desk to find the files they were here for in the first place\nBut no answer came.\nKunikida rolled his eyes, sure it had been a solid hit, but he had seen his partner defeat whole armed squads with various bullets in his body.\n\"Dazai! Get up and stop acting like a damn child!\" He snapped again\nInstead of an answer from the brunet he heard a snicker coming from the man Atsushi had pinned on the ground.\nBefore Kunikida had a chance to shut him up, the man grinned and spoke\n\"Oh, the irony in those words\"\nThe blond frowned in worry. That couldn't be good.\n\"What do you mean?\" Asked the weretiger\nThe man let out a tired sigh \"It's no fun when I tell you. But... I suggest you go check on your partner\"\nAtsushi shared a puzzled look with Kunikida and the blond walked towards the pile of books.\nHe clenched his fists when he realised there was no sign of his partner. Kunikida scanned the room when his eyes spotted movement in a dark corner. He made his way towards it, mind jumping into the worst-case scenario.\nWhen he finally was close enough to the figure, he realised something; It was far too small to be Dazai.\nWhen Kunikida's eyes adjusted to the darkness of the room his jaw went slack when he understood what he was seeing.\nThere was a kid, looking no older than... five or six wrapped around his partners' iconic cardigan. He was rocking back and forth, head lowered and legs brought tightly towards his chest, trying to make himself as small as possible.\nThis was defiantly not the worst-case scenario Kunikida was thinking of.\nOn second thought blond was actually embarrassed it took him this long to realise what was going on.\n\"Dazai?\" He tested his theory, although he already knew he was right\nThe violent flinch the kid made in response backed him up.\n\"Shit...\" Kunikida sighed, he didn't want to have to deal with an even more childish Dazai\n\"Kunikida? What is it?\" Asked Atsushi who couldn't see a thing due to the position he was in\n\"Figured it out yet?\" The blond could tell the man was smirking from his tone of voice\n\"Atsushi, Dazai has been turned into a child\" He grumbled and walked towards the man on the floor\n\"What?\" The weretiger wheezed out\n\"Revers it, immediately\"\nThe man chucked dryly \"I'm afraid my ability doesn't work like that, boss\"\n\"Enlighten me\" Kunikida deadpanned\u00a0\n\"There is a number on his left wrist. Go check it\" He spoke and the blond made his way back towards the kid again \"It represents the minutes, hours, or days my gift will work on him. Depending on the strength of my attack, the duration will vary\"\n\"Dazai, show me your wrist, now\" He commanded and the kid widened his eyes in fear\nHe extended his left arm and showed it to the blond\n\nXIV/D\n\n\"The letter next to the number is the duration. M for minutes, H for hours and D for days\"\n\"Dammit!\" He cursed and the brunet quickly moved his arm away from him, curling again into himself\n\"How long...?\" Asked the weretiger\n\"Fourteen days\" Kunikida spoke, annoyance present in his tone\nHe was about to curse again when his mind realised something\n\"Wait, Dazai, stand up. I need you to nullify the man's ability\"\nThe brunet, still shaking, followed the orders without question. He made his way towards the man on the floor, avoiding all sorts of eye contact, and placed a shaky hand on his shoulder. His ability activated but the cocky smile plastered on the enemy was making Kunikida feel uneasy.\nWhen the blond grasped his wrist again the number was still there, it hadn't worked. Dazai also seemed to realise that as his face twisted in terror. He was about to apologise for the failure but the man spoke before him\n\"You could ask me before trying in vain\" He shrugged\n\"Speak\" Kunikida commanded\nHis mouth curved into a smile \"Think of me like a snake. If I bite you and you kill me afterward, I won't be able to bite anyone else because, of course, I'm dead. But don't forget my poison is still inside your body. Even if I'm dead it will travel around your veins until... it finally kills you\"\nKunikida felt the kid tense beside him. He chose to ignore it but part of him was relieved he had reacted negatively to the idea of his own death.\nThe man snickered when he saw the kids' reaction.\n\"Now, now, don't worry. My ability isn't actually poison. It won't kill you\" He revealed and Dazai let out a breath of air he was holding\n\"So he's stuck like this for um...fourteen days?\" Atsushi spoke\n\"Indeed, my friend. Enjoy yourselves\"\nKunikida had had enough \"You're done speaking. Atsushi, I'm calling the agency, keep him immobile. Dazai, sit on the chair and don't move\"\nAs soon as the order left his mouth he watched the kid nod and sit down on the chair, eyes glued on the floor.\nHis mind wondered for a second. The weirdest thing out of this situation is that Dazai hadn't even said a word. He had expected the kid and his witty remarks to cause him trouble and headaches, but he had done the complete opposite. He was almost trying to make himself invisible.\nKunikida shook his head and called the agency\n\"Yes hello Sir. We have a problem\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFukuzawa and Yosano soon arrived at the scene with other agents who escorted the man and arrested him. Kunikida had told them everything that had happened during the mission and they were now deciding the next move.\n\"Weren't you the one saying this could've been an easy solo mission? Now we've got a kid\" Yosano teased\nThe blond man huffed \"It was supposed to be, I planned it to be like that. I should have quintuple checked no one was in the building\"\n\"Dazai got hit because of me. I was asking way too many questions and I distracted him, I'm sorry\" Atsushi confessed, looking apologetic\n\"It was a simple mishap. No serious damage was done. Still, I expect you two to be way more attentive, don't let your guard down even in the simplest of missions\" Fukuzawa spoke sternly\n\"Yes, sir. We apologise\"\nWhile they kept talking, Yosano made her way towards the kid.\nHe still had his cardigan wrapped around him, falling everywhere as it was way too large on him. He was looking at his lap, but he seemed to notice that someone was walking towards him and tensed immediately.\nYosano made a mental note about that\n\"Hello Dazai, my name is Akiko Yosano. Do you understand what happened to you? What that ability user did?\" Her voice was gentle and soft, something the boy hadn't expected\nHe nodded\n\"Great. Well, I'm a colleague of yours, we work together. Can I ask you some questions?\"\nHe nodded again\n\"How old are you?\"\nDazai frowned a little, or at least that's what Yosano thought happened because with his bangs covering his face, so she couldn't really tell.\n\"...Seven\" He replied, but it came out almost as a question\nHe looked way too small for a seven-year-old \n\"Do you remember anything from when you were older?\"\nThis time the answer came out faster\n\"No, Im sorry\" Dazai mumbled\nYosano smiled at him even though he wasn't even looking at her\n\"That's alright. Now, how are you feeling? Are you dizzy, hungry, tired?\"\n\"Im fine\"\nYosano could tell he lied. Seven-year-old Dazai hadn't still mastered the art of bending the truth.\nShe was thankful for that.\n\"Okay, if that changes do tell me. Now follow me\" She stood up and walked towards the rest of the agents, Dazai trailed behind her\nThe raven informed them of what she had recently learned and then asked the question everyone was probably thinking of:\n\"Well then, what are we going to do with him?\"\nYosano saw from the corner of her eye that Dazai had clasped his hands together, he started scratching his wrists a little too strongly.\nShe made a mental note of that too.\n\"I can't do a lot. With Kyouka already staying with me I can barely handle it\" Atsushi confessed sheepishly\n\"The boy can't stay with me, it would be way too much risk as I'm already a target to too many crime organisations\" Fukuzawa concluded\nDazai had started shaking again. His mind was going way too fast for his own comfort. What was going to happen to him? Were they really telling the truth? Were they bad guys? Were they going to-\n\"Id rather not. I'm really not capable of living with a child at the moment\" Yosano confirmed and all the eyes fell towards the blond, who widened his eyes in realisation\n\"No! I'm not keeping the suicidal maniac! There must be other options!\" Kunikida hissed\nThe kid was unable to suppress a flinch.\nDazai's eyes were starting to water. He wanted to run. Why was he being so mean to him? Dazai didn't think he was a suicidal maniac! The kid didn't understand what was happening and the stress of it was starting to affect him. The brunet was focusing very hard on keeping his breathing under control and trying not to cry, but the bickering of the adults was so familiar to him he was failing miserably.\nYosano, who was already putting together bits and pieces of what could be wrong with the boy, grasped that he was on the verge of tears, looking terrified at the blond and his outburst.\n\"Kunikida, I advise you to calm do-\"\nHe scoffed\n\"Of course not! Being partners with him is already enough torture, and now I have to take care of him outside of work? Please, I would rath-\"\n\"Stop it, immediately\" The doctor ordered with a firm tone, and everyone set their eyes on her\nKunikida wanted to ask her why but Yosano was quicker\n\"You're scaring him\" She simply concluded and all the eyes fell on Dazai, who was doing his best to hold back his tears.\n\nShit\n\nKunikida hadn't even... He never meant to make Dazai cry.\nGuilt creeped upon him.\nThe raven kneeled down next to the kid and gently spoke to him \"We're sorry for upsetting you Dazai. Kunikida is normally a lot nicer, he's just had a rough day\"\nThe brunets breathing hitched \"Im sorry\"\nHe didn't even know what he was apologising for, but he hoped it could get him out of any trouble.\n\"There is nothing to apologise for, Dazai. Now, would you like to go sit on the chair until you're calm?\" She suggested\n\"Yes please\" And with that said he quickly walked away from the adults.\nWhen he was out of hearing reach, Kunikida spoke again.\n\"I didn't mean to-\" He started but was interrupted\n\"I know, but you seem to be forgetting is that even though it's Dazai, it isn't the Dazai we know. His childhood wasn't the best\"\nAtsushi spoke, a little unsure \"What... what happened to him?\"\nYosano sighed \"Dazai never told me a thing apart from the fact that it was bad. But from what I can tell right now it's severe physical and emotional abuse and neglect. He's underweight, there are already a significant amount of scars and burns on his body. Avoids physical contact, finches at loud sounds, voices, or movements. Way too alert for a seven-year-old. Minimal eye contact, extremely obedient without any question... and all that is only from observing him for 15 minutes, so there could be other issues I'm not aware of\"\nKunikida let out a huff in defeat \"Im an asshole\"\nFukuzawa smiled at him sympathetically \"You've made a mistake, it's not equivalent to being a bad person\"\n\"Sir, I apologise for my unprofessional behavior. I should have seen the signs earlier. I'll stay with Dazai if that's what he wants\"\nFukuzawa gave him warm smile\n\"Very well then, problem solved. You'll still have work but do bring Dazai with you. For the next two weeks, you'll stay off the field. Now, you have the day off. I suggest you go and buy the stuff you'll need for the boy\"\nKunikida nodded and made his way towards the child, who stiffed when he saw him get closer\nThis wasn't going to be easy.\nThe blond kneeled in front of him and this time when he spoke, his tone was softer than all the times before.\n\"I apologise for my behaviour, Dazai. I was mean and inconsiderate. My intentions were never to harm or scare you\"\nThe brunet blinked, face going blank\nOut of all the things Dazai thought was going to happen, this... was not one of them.\nNo one had ever apologised to him.\nWell except for these people he had just met, who were certainly weird.\n\"I understand if you don't accept my apologies. But I want to make it clear that not now, or never, will I do something to harm you\"\nDazai blinked again\nThis had to be a joke. A prank of some kind. There was no way what he was saying was the truth.\nYet there was still a little hope inside of him. Hope that Kunikida wasn't lying and that he was actually being nice.\n\"I accept your apologies\" He revealed, and it formed a little smile on the blonds face\nIt looked... real?\n\"I'm glad you do. Now I haven't had lunch and I'm starving, would you like to accompany me and eat something?\"\nHe hoped there wouldn't be a catch, because Dazai was really hungry.\nSo the kid nodded and Kunikida got up\n\"Very well, lets go to the mall\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was amazing, Dazai had enjoyed it very much. He had been treated to the biggest bowl of udon he had ever seen. The kid had even been allowed dessert while he listened to Kunikida talk about the origin of the dishes they were eating.\nHe already knew all the stuff Kunikida was telling him, but Dazai was not about to test his luck so he stayed quiet.\nAlso, the blond talked with such passion that the kid had found it severely entertaining.\nAfter lunch they began shopping.\nFirst came the essentials, extra food, toiletry, medicine appropriate for kids. And then they started shopping for clothes.\n\"Dazai, what's your favourite colour?\"\nHe was taken a little aback but quickly replied \"Orange and... and purple\"\nKunikida hummed in approval and started looking for clothes for him.\nHe picked up a bunch and showed them to the brunet.\n\"Is there anything you don't like from these clothes?\" He asked\nDazai didn't know what to do.\nCould he tell the truth? Nothing bad had happened yet. Maybe it was all a test to see how bad he would be and at the end they would punish him for ev-\n\"I won't get angry at you if you don't\" He reassured the kid\n\"Dogs are scary\" He finally whispered and Kunikida nodded as he put away the shirt.\n\"Noted, no dogs\"\nWait... was it that simple?\nHe followed the adult through the isles, still confused about what had happened earlier.\n\"Okay Im going to get a few things I know you will like, but you can choose a toy yourself, multiple if you want\" Offered Kunikida\nDazai looked around him. He was so submerged in his thoughts he hadn't realised he was in the toy aisle. And now he could choose one? This was way too much.\n\"I... are you... I- I can have one?\" He asked, hoping he hadn't misheard it\n\"More than one, now go pick whatever you want, I'll be right here\" Kunikida smiled at the kid\nHe still had felt bad for making Dazai cry, so he hoped this would help the kid warm up to him a little .\n\"Thank you very much\" He said and he went looking for toys\n5 minutes later, just as Kunikida expected, Dazai came back with only one toy in his hands. It was a penguin plushie. It was pastel purple and had a little pink bow on the top of its head.\n\"Can I have him, please?\" Dazai whispered as he clutched the little penguin close to his chest\n\"Of course you can. I think penguins are extraordinary animals\" Kunikida reassured the kid and he saw the slightest of smiles form on his face\n\"Now, do you want to help me choose more toys with you? There are so many things it must be overwhelming\" The blond encouraged Dazai\nThe kid nodded and Kunikida felt a little more at ease.\nMaybe these two weeks wouldn't be that bad after all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce they got all the shopping done and they arrived home it was already dinner time. Kunikida had set up the guest room for Dazai and he was pretty proud of how it had turned out, it looked way more lively than it did a couple of hours ago.\nHe organised all of Dazai's clothes and had placed his toys neatly in a bunch of boxes. Also, using his own deduction skills he had bought the kid a little night light even though he had insisted he wasn't scared of the dark.\nDinner was fairly simple as he was extremely tired and the last thing he wanted to do was cook, so he microwaved some ramen and called it a day.\nAs they ate in silence Kunikida realised something, Dazai was also exhausted. It was amusing watching how his partner was struggling to keep his eyes open while he ate, a little frown forming on his face whenever the ramen fell from his chopsticks.\nOnce the kid had finished his food Kunikida sent him to bed, wishing him goodnight.\nThe blond still had a couple of chores he had to do so he stayed up for a little more.\nHe cooked and packed up their lunch for tomorrow, did the dishes, and cleaned the living room. After an hour or so he was bout to go to his room when he heard movements coming from the brunets room.\nKunikida frowned, with how tired Dazai was at dinner, he should have been long asleep by now.\nHe gently knocked on the door, hearing how on the other side the kid gulped.\n\"Dazai? Are you okay? Can I come in?\" He asked\nThere came no answer for a few seconds, and then a hesitant \"...Okay\"\nWhen he entered the room he saw Dazai sitting on his bed, plushie on his lap. He was wearing the new set of pyjamas that were pastel blue and had little stars on them. Kunikida felt his heart melt a little at the sight, he looked adorable.\nBut he quickly shook the thought away when he recognised something else: He looked scared.\n\"Why are you up?\"\u00a0\nThat was definitely the wrong thing to ask because Dazai flinched backwards and looked slightly more panicked than before.\n\"Hey, don't worry, I'm not angry at you. I'm just curious on why you are awake\" Kunikida quickly clarified\nDazai's expression relaxed a little\n\"I couldn't sleep, I'm sorry\" He explained guiltily\n\"It's okay, don't apologise, it isn't your fault. This whole situation must be a little scary, right?\"\nDazai slowly nodded\n\"Hmm... let's see. What could make you sleepy\" Kunikida thought for a second \"The older Dazai would always fall asleep when I talked about my notebook and fishing, but I doubt you want me to bore you to sleep. Oh, would you like me to read you a story?\"\nDazai's eyes gleamed in surprise\n\nBingo\n\n\"Yes please\"\n\"Okay, I'll get a book you'll like. Lay back down\"\nDazai obeyed and tucked himself in and Kunikida searched a book for him. He had a bunch of classics and he opted for Alice in Wonderland.\nWhen he came back he sat on a chair next to the boys' bed and extended the book to him so he could look at the cover.\n\"Have you read it?\"\nDazai shook his head\n\"It's a beautiful story, so sit back and try to relax\" Kunikida smiled softly at the kid, who shyly gave him a small smile in return before breaking eye contact.\nKunikida read for almost 45 minutes when finally Dazai's breathing evened out. As silently as possible he set down the book and left to go to bed himself, leaving the boy's door half open so if there were any more troubles he would hear them.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nMONDAY\n\n\n\nThe next morning when Dazai and Kunikida arrived at the agency they were greeted with a whole lot of attention, because, at the end of the day, 7-year-old Dazai was adorable.\n\"So... I work with all of you?\" He asked, toying with the penguin he had brought to work\n\"Yes, indeed my tiny Dazai\" Ranpo said and grinned at him \"You know, yesterday Yosano told me you were coming, so-\" He jumped from his seat, startling a little the kid, and walked towards his desk and opened one of the drawers \"I made sure to buy all types of candy you could possibly want\"\nHe placed a huge plastic back on his desk, all full of candy.\nRanpo smiled at the kid\n\"Candy?\"\n\"Yes, do you want one? You can have all you like, but not too much because I know for a fact it can give you a tummy ache!\"\nHis face scrunched up, he didn't know if he should talk or not.\n\"It's yours Dazai, would you like something from the bag?\"\n\"Chocolate, please\" He had started to shake a little.\nThe kid knew it was a trap. He knew that what came next would be a punishment for being greedy, still, he was unable to make himself stop hoping that maybe something nice would come his way.\nHe flinched when something was placed in his hand.\nWait... it was actually a chocolate bar? Were they really being nice to-\n\nDon't be stupid, Dazai.\n\n\"Is it... bad?\"\n\"No! Of course not! Tell you what, I'll eat it with you, so you aren't scared\"\nRanpo snapped the chocolate and gave the bigger piece to the kid. The rest of the agency watched quietly form their desks. No one had ever seen the raven act so gentle with a kid before, he usually bickered back and forth with them.\n\"Okay, now we can eat it together!\"\nDazai still looked unsure\n\"Or maybe you would want me to eat it first?\" Ranpo raised his eyebrows\n\"Yes please. Im sorry\"\nHe shrugged it off \"No problem\"\nRanpo ate the chocolate and beamed at the kid\n\"There you go! It's really good, although I prefer coconut and chocolate bars, those are the best\"\nDazai still felt uneasy and it was written all over his face so the raven spoke again.\u00a0\n\"Don't worry Dazai, if you don't want to eat it, you don't have to. I won't get mad\" Ranpo reassured him\nThe brunet shook his head. He could remember from a very faint and vague memory he really liked chocolate so he took a bite of the treat.\nRanpo was right, it was really good. And it actually was a chocolate bar.\nDazai gave the man a smile in form of gratitude\n\"It's great, thank you very much\" He spoke softly and Ranpo smirked\n\"Im glad you like it, mini Dazai! Now remember if you ever want candy or anything, ask me!\" He said happily as he sat down back at his desk.\nSoon everyone started working and Dazai moved to the sofa with his plushie and a bag that Kunikida had packed for him.\nHe was fidgeting, feeling a little out of place. Was he even allowed to play? Could he get his book out? He was trying very hard to make no noise as he would dread to disturb the other especially while they worked.\nHe just sat there and hugged the penguin tighter, trying to make himself invisible.\nWould they get mad at him?\nWere they going to shout if he disturbed them?\nWould they take his plushie away?\nWould they hit him if-\n\"Do they have a name?\" A voice brought him out of his thoughts, he saw Atsushi sit in front of him\nDazai shook his head\n\"It's okay\" The white-haired boy smiled sweetly \"A good name takes time to come up with!\"\nThe kid stayed silent for a couple of seconds and then \"You... you were there when I woke up. With Kunikida\"\n\"Yes! Do you remember me before that?\"\nDazai avoided his gaze \"No, Im sorry\"\n\"Oh no, it's okay! I was just curious\" He smiled apologetically and quirky changed the topic \"Are penguins your favourite animal?\" Atsushi asked, gesturing the plushie\nThe brunet shook his head \"No, I just really liked him because he's very soft. And purple\"\n\"That's a pretty valid reason to get him. So what would your favourite animal be? I think mine are dolphins\"\nDazai though for a bit. No one had ever asked him for his favourite animal\n\"Pandas. They have a docile temperament... and they're fluffy\" He answered\n\"Yeah, they certainly look huggable\"\nThe brunet nodded and stayed silent again. He was a little scared to talk to anyone because he felt like he was going to say the wrong thing and they were going to get mad at him, and that's the last thing he wanted.\n\"Dazai, what is in the bag?\"\nThe brunet squirmed in his seat a little. Could he even have these types of stuff in a workplace? It was highly unprofessional, he shouldn't have let the bag be seen in the first place.\nStupid Dazai\n\"Kunikida packed me some stuff to do while he was at work. Im sorry, I can get rid of it\"\nAtsushi waved his hands in despair\n\"No no please, don't do that! It's perfectly fine! I was just wondering if you'd like to get some stuff out so you don't get bored\" He smiled sheepishly\n\"I can?\" He asked, wanting to be perfectly sure he was allowed to do it\n\"Of course Dazai, go ahead\"\n\"Um\" He opened his bag and shuffled the interior a little \"Kunikida got me a workbook with activities. It has a lot of math and English, but it's okay, it's what I enjoy the most. Oh, and literature\"\nHe set the workbook on the table and looked at Atsushi\n\"That's great! Do you have a pen umm or pencil?\"\n\"Yes, Kunikida got me a lot of supplies\"\n\"Well then, I'll leave you to it. Have fun Dazai!\" He concluded as he stood up\n\"A... Atsushi?\" The brunet spoke, fidgeting nervously with his fingers\n\"Yes, Dazai?\"\n\"Kaiyo. I'll name him Kaiyo\"\nThe weretiger smiled at him\n\"The ocean. Very fitting for a penguin\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Kunikida got off of work, Dazai packed his things and politely said his goodbyes to the rest of the agency.\nThe walk home was very peaceful. Even though the blond had a car, he preferred walking to work because it was fairly close and the traffic in Yokohama was unbearable. He also liked walking because the route he took (the most efficient of course) made him pass through a park with trees and flowers adorning every inch of it. He had grown very fond of the park.\nAnd Dazai seemed to like it too, as his eyes twinkled in awe at the flowers around him.\n\"Those are tulips, although I'm pretty sure you knew that already\"\nThe kid nodded, still looking around him\n\"Do you know a lot about them?\"\nDazai pursed his lips in concentration \"They-they were first planted in Turkey and brought over to Europe in the 16th century. They can symbolise three things: Deep love, rebirth, or charity. The colour of the tulip also has a meaning... Um I can continue if you want\"\n\"That was impressive Dazai. Not a lot of seven-year-olds know as much as you do\" He praised and Dazai's face flushed\n\"Th-Th-Thank you\" He stammered out \"I enjoy learning... and reading. It makes me feel more aware\"\nKunikida hummed in agreement\n\"It does make you more socially aware. But again not a lot of kids prioritized that\"\nDazai's silence made the blond realised what he had just implied\n\nShit\n\n\"Not that there is anything wrong with it\" He added calmly, even though on the inside he was erratic \"I myself was also one of the kids that really enjoyed learning\"\nDazai's face brightened, but he quickly composed himself\n\"Oh\"\nThe rest of the walk was filled with a comfortable silence and when they arrived home dinner was just as peaceful.\n\"Would you like desert?\"\nDazai shook his head \"Im full, thank you\"\nKunikida was surprised by how polite the kid always was. It also angered him because he knew from Dazais's background that it was the substance of abuse, but still, it was weird seeing his partner be so gentle and quiet all the time.\n\"You're welcome. I still have a bunch of stuff to work on but I'll let you go and rest. Good night Dazai\"\nThe blond sat down on the couch and took out the files of the latest murder case he had been assigned to.\n\"Goodnight Kunikida\" The kid said as he hurried into his room\nWhen he was alone, the blond let out a breath of air he thought he had been holding for the whole day. Being with Dazai wasn't an easy task. Everything seemed to scare him, all good things were new and there had been multiple\u00a0triggers that he had carefully\u00a0avoided throughout his day.\nHe had been walking on eggshells all day, hoping his words or actions wouldn't give him a bad time. And even though today had gone fairly smoothly, Kunikida knew for a fact that in the next two weeks a lot of problems were to come.\nMoving all of his anxieties and worries aside, the blond focused on the case in front of him, hoping it would clear his mind for a bit. Soon enough he set up a pace and worked steadily for almost an hour.\nWhen he turned a page over he heard the kids' door creek open. Kunikida glanced his way and saw the brunet.\nDazai stood at the front of his door. Distress clouded his features as he squeezed Kaiyo closer to him. He looked like he was having an internal battle with himself.\nKunikida was taken aback... what could have possibly happened?\n\"Dazai? What's wrong? Are you hurt?\"\nThe brunets bottom lip trembled and he gently shook his head. He opened his mouth to say something but no words came out.\nHe then took a deep breath and settled on saying: \"I-i-its dumb. Im sorry- I should... I... uh goodnight\" He stuttered out and turned back to his room\n\"Dazai, wait\" He insisted as softly as possible\nThe brunet froze in his tracks and bowed his head\n\"Im sorry for disturbing\" He shut his eyes tightly\nDazai really didn't want to be punished right now\n\"Wha- No, you're not disturbing. I was just confused about what made you so upset. You can tell me whatever you want, I won't get angry at you\" The blond gave him an encouraging smile\nThe kid was unable to suppress a whimper, feeling immensely overwhelmed by his contradicting feeling.\nHalf of him wanted to run and the other half desperately\u00a0sought comfort.\n\"I don't...\" He hiccuped \"Its- I...I- s-s-sorry\" Tears threatened to fall from his hazel eyes and he was stroking Kaiyo's fur in order to soothe himself.\n\"You don't have to speak if you don't want to, I just want you to calm down, do you understand that?\"\nHe nodded\n\"Great. Why don't you sit down on the couch while I prepare you a cup of warm milk and honey, how does that sound?\"\nDazai nodded again as he sat on the couch. Kunikida quickly worked on the beverage and as soon as it was done he handed it to the kid, who took it with gratitude.\nWhen the cup was empty, both of them stayed on the couch without saying a single word. The blond was aware Dazai was trying to gather his thoughts, so he let him be.\n\"Can you read to me a bedtime story, please?\"\nIt came out so suddenly and in such a hurry that Kunikida almost wasn't able to pick up what his partner had told him\n\"Of course, Dazai. Go to bed and I'll get the book\" His face softened and watched the kid walk back to his room, a lot less distressed\nWhen he was out of sight, Kunikida let out a tired sigh... this poor child\nAll of that suffering just to ask him for a simple story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nTUESDAY\n\n\n\n\nIt was a chilly spring morning when the pair were on their walk to work. Kunikida was carrying two thermoses with his morning coffee and warm milk and honey for the kid, who couldn't take his beverage because his hands were occupied with Kaiyo.\n\"I also packed you a colouring book because I think we're going to leave the office a little later today\"\nDazai nodded \"Is it because of your case?\"\n\"Yes. There is a lot of paperwork involved because of legal stuff, although its something I do enjoy working on\"\n\"D-did I?\"\n\"Yes, but never admit it. You and Ranpo breeze through paperwork like there is no tomorrow, but you also love working in the field\"\n\"Oh. Can I use guns?\"\nHe was taken aback by the question and Dazai seemed to sense that\n\"Not that I want to use them! Uh... I was just asking because they frighten me now, so I was wondering if big Dazai had um conquered his fear\"\n\"Big Dazai has an amazing aim. Better than most people I know\"\n\"Oh\"\n\"Any more questions?\"\n\"Hmmm, yes one more\"\nKunikida grinned at the kids' understandable curiosity. He was starting to recognise his partner again.\n\"Am I... Am I good at my job?\"\n\"Yes. You're excellent. One of the best\"\nDazai blushed and broke eye contact \"Th-thank you... Im- Im glad you are my partner\"\n\"Me too, Dazai. Me too\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time when they arrived at the agency, Dazai felt a little more confident and took out his colouring book and pencils. Still, heat rose up his cheeks because he felt a quite childish (even for an actual child). Everyone was working so hard and on such important stuff and Dazai was here colouring.\nBut those thoughts quickly disappeared when he saw the book. He felt in awe. He had never owned one of these and really didn't know how his colouring skills would be, but that wouldn't be a problem for now.\nHe chose to colour in a picture of a dolphin. The back of his mind had the great idea to give it to Atsushi when he was done because it was his favourite animal, but that required way too much confidence and bravery, something Dazai felt he lacked.\nWhen he started picking out the colours for his drawing, someone sat down beside him.\nHe looked up and saw a boy with the purest smile he had yet seen.\n\nKenji\n\n\"Hi Dazai! Are you colouring in a picture?\"\nHe nodded\n\"A dolphin! How nice!\" He cheered \"Do you think I could colour something with you?\"\nThat seemed like something he would enjoy.\nHe nodded again\n\"Great! You can choose an image for me if you want to of course\"\u00a0\nDazai pursed his lips and furrowed his eyebrows in concentration as he scanned the book for an appropriate picture to give to the blond.\nRemembering a conversation he overheard yesterday, Dazai ripped out a page and gave it to Kenji\n\"A cow!\" He exclaimed happily \"I love cows! Thank you very much\"\nDazai turned around to hide the blush creeping into his cheeks, he really wasn't used to so many praises and affection.\n\"Well then, let's start colouring!\"\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe fun didn't last too long for Kenji, because not even an hour later he got called to deliver a package with Kyouka at the other side of Yokohama, so Dazai was left to finish his drawing alone. Not that he didn't mind. Sometimes he liked to be alone, only when his mind was calm too and happy thoughts crowded his brain.\nDuring the afternoon when Dazai was peacefully\u00a0reading a book, Ranpo decided to visit him.\n\"Hello mini Dazai! Do you mind if I keep you company?\" He asked as he sat in front of him\nThe kid shook his head\n\"Wonderful! You know, I have a bunch of stuff we can do. Would you like to play with me?\"\nHe nodded\n\"How about a riddle?\" Ranpo smirked\nDazai nodded eagerly: He loved riddles, he always had a good time when he did them.\n\"Hmmm lets see. I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have nobody, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?\"\nDazai squinted his eyes, thinking about the words that were said to him\n\"E-echo?\"\n\"Correct!\" Ranpo clapped\u00a0\n\"What English word has three consecutive double letters?\"\nThis was easy for Dazai, it wasn't much of a riddle.\n\"Bookkeeper!\" He replied, unable to hide his excitement\n\"Excellent! You're really good\" Ranpo praised and Dazai felt himself blush again\nWhy were people so proud of him all the time?\nWas it normal?\n\"Now for the last one: A woman shoots her husband, holds him underwater for five minutes, hangs him and has a nice dinner with him. Explain\"\nDazai's eyes widened in realisation. This one had been easy too.\n\"Oh! Its... its- its a developed picture! Of the husband\"\n\"Correct! You know, when I told Atsushi this one he replied with: Murder\"\nAnd suddenly Dazai let out a giggle.\nA giggle.\nKunikida was trying to stay as calm and composed as possible but he felt like throwing fireworks. It was the first time that he had heard the boy laugh and hopefully it wouldn't be the last.\nWould have he been alone and maybe Kunikida would have shed a tear.\n\"I know, silly right?\"\nAtsushi blushed \"Hey! Not everyone is as smart as you guys!\"\n\"Im aware\"\nAtsushi gasped\n\"You know what? At least I can ride the train!\"\n\"Low hit Atsushi\" Muttered Junichiro from his desk\nDazai watched as the scene unfolded comically, the two men bickering like children.\n\"You got lost three times when we traveled together!\"\n\"Those are minor details! I got us where we had to go, didn't I?\"\nRanpo scoffed\n\"Barely, I bet it was your first time on a train too\"\n\"Wha- No! Of course not! You know, next time I'll make sure to lose you when we travel together\"\n\"Please, you'll get lost too\"\nDazai clasped his hands over his mouth as he giggled again.\nAtsushi poked his tongue out and Ranpo was about to throw at him a cushion when Kunikida interfered\n\"Children, please behave. Resume your argument after work\"\nThe raven huffed annoyingly and the kid would have thought he really was angry if he hadn't heard Atsushi snort from his desk and automatically making Ranpo grin.\nKunikida smiled to himself and without even looking up at them he said\n\"And by the way, none of you know how to ride the train. Dazai had to get you both home\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it was time to leave, Ranpo realised how Dazai looked completely torn, clutching a drawing, as he watched Atsushi say his goodbyes to the team.\nHe had worked hard on the drawing and genuinely thought it looked nice, so he really wanted to give it to the weretiger. He wanted to make him proud.\nHe just didn't know how to ask him. His voice wouldn't come out.\n\"Would you like me to tell Atsushi to come over here?\" Ranpo asked\nDazai blinked, how did he...\u00a0\nOh right, Super Deduction\nHe nodded and right after the raven called for the weretiger\n\"Yes Ranpo?\"\nRanpo didn't reply, he made a gesture towards the kid\nWhen Atsushi looked at him, his gaze was on the ground and his hand, slightly shaking, was extended with a paper in it,\n\"Is it for me?\" He asked cautiously\nDazai nodded\nWhen he grabbed it the kid had the courage to look at him, hoping to see a positive reaction\nWhen Atsushi smiled Dazai felt his anxieties leave his body\n\"It's lovely! Thank you very much, Dazai\" He said, and it sounded genuine\nThe kid felt joy bubble up in his chest and the weretiger noticed how his eyes beamed\n\"Y-you're welcome, Atsushi\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKunikida had been right. They had stayed 2 hours more in the office because of the paperwork. The blond would have been there longer but he had noticed how Dazai had started to get sleepy and was probably hungry, so they left.\nAfter dinner Kunikida, instead of putting the kid through the stress again, took the initiative and offered Dazai if he wanted a bedtime story, who obviously accepted quite happily.\nWhen the blond noticed the kids breathing even out, he quietly made his way to the sofa and continued to work on the case.\nEverything went smoothly until at 2am Kunikida started to feel his eyelids grow heavy. He tried to fight off the tiredness but it mustn't have worked out because during some point of his reading he fell asleep on the couch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\n\n\nThat same night, at 3:31 am, Kunikida woke up from a piercing scream, coming from Dazai's room.\nHis instincts automatically kicked in and he dashed into the bedroom, hoping it was a nightmare and not an actual threat.\nWhen he entered the room he knew he was in the right as no one was in the room but Dazai, so it had been a bad dream.\nBut it seemed... extremely bad\nKunikida watched as the kid sobbed violently, slumped against the wall. He was kicking and shrieking but couldn't actually distinguish any word that came from his mouth. Kunikida backed up, panicked, and was unsure on how to approach the situation.\nDazai was now harming himself, one hand tugging fiercely on his hair and the other scratched his face as if he wanted to tear it off.\nWhen Kunikida was about to interfere something else caught his attention.\nAll of a sudden the unpleasant smell of ammonia suffocated the air and the blond realised what had happened as soon as a dark patch started to appear in the kids' pants.\nIt brought him into a worse state of hysteria.\nDazai's face paled and twisted in horror as he cried harder than before, deeply worrying Kunikida because at this point he was either going to pass out or make himself sick.\n\"Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! \" Yelled the kid frantically, struggling for air\n\"Dazai, it's fine. Im not mad at you, no one is going to hurt you\" Kunikida reassured gently, but also loud enough so that the brunet would hear\nBut if he heard, he chose to ignore it\n\"Please, I didn't mean to! Don't hurt me please! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry!\"\nDazai sobbed unconsolably\n\"I'll be good! I'll be g-good, please!\" The kid begged\nRight about now Kunikida wished it hadn't been a nightmare, but some bad guys he could've easily fought.\nKunikida never in his life had felt so helpless than right now. The brunet reacted negatively at any kind of touch and he didn't seem to be processing what the blond was telling him, so, as gut-wrenching as it was for him, he had to wait until Dazai exhausted himself.\nIt was the longest 18 minutes of his life.\nDazai had finally ran out of tears and apologise. He was resting his head on his knees, hugging himself tightly, trying to stop his body from shaking,\n\"Buddy? I brought you some water, you're throat must be sore\"\nHe didn't move\n\"Im not mad at you. I want you to be safe and happy, Dazai. Im never going to do anything to harm you\"\nDazai felt like he was going to throw up. It was like his mind and body were at war all the damn time, not letting him breathe for even a second.\nHis mind knew bad things were going to happen when he trusted someone. It had happened before and it was going to happen now. It was inevitable.\nBut because of the sudden kindness being presented to him, all his body seemed to want was a hug. It was begging him for someone to hold him, to hold his hand, stroke his hair, anything really.\nDazai finally took the water and gulped it down quickly and his throat instantly felt less itchy.\nSomething that didn't seem to be getting better was the wetness in his pants. They were cold and he started to feel incredibly uncomfortable, sending involuntary shivers down his spine, but he felt too embarrassed and weak to say something about it.\nKunikida, who had noticed the boy tremble, decided to speak\n\"Would you like me to run you a warm bath? You'll feel much better after it\"\nDazai nodded as he lowered his gazed shamefully and rasped out a \"Im sorry\"\n\"It's okay, accidents happen, even to the bravest of people\"\nAnd with that said Kunikida prepared the bath for the kid (Don't call him a softie but he even put a bit of lavender soap so it would have bubbles)\nWhen it was done he went back to Dazai's room and told him it was good to go, and the kid left.\nOnce Dazai stepped out of the bathroom Kunikida was sitting next to the bed with a book in his hand, warm milk on the nightstand and a new pair of clean sheets.\nIt made Dazai feel warm inside. Kunikida seemed to care for him.\nThe kid didn't need to be told what to do as he gently tucked himself in and hugged Kaiyo close, the soft texture of it having a soothing effect on the little boy.\n\"Well then, lets continue.... \u00a0'Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next morning on their way to work Kunikida wasn't sure when or how it happened, but sometimes after a loud noise from the garbage truck, Dazai's tiny hand was in his.\nIt was the first time Dazai seemed to touch someone willingly and it seemed to be as a big of a shock for both of them because he saw how the brunet's eyes widened in surprise as he looked at their hands and started shaking\n\nPull away, pull away, pull away, pull away\n\n\nTouch bad, touch bad, touch bad, touch bad\n\n\nDazai run, Dazai run, Dazai run, Dazai-\n\nInstead of saying anything, Kunikida felt like the appropriate way to reassure Dazai was to rub little circles on his hand with his thumb.\nAnd he was right.\nSuddenly there were no bad thoughts clouding his mind, just the feeling of a warm hand holding his, rubbing soft circles.\nAs soon as he did that Dazai's shoulders released all the tension they had and the pair continued on their way to work.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\"Good morning Dazai!\" Said Atsushi as they entered the agency\n\"Good morning\" Replied the brunet politely, with a small smile plastered on his face\n\"I brought something we can do today\"\nDazai raised his eyebrows, sitting down on the couch with Kaiyo.\n\"Do you like crosswords?\"\nThe kid nodded eagerly\n\"Great! I loved them too, even though Im really not the best\"\nAtsushi pulled out a crossword and sat next to Dazai on the couch\n\"I used to do a lot of them when I was at the orphanage, it's one of the few things that made me happy\"\nDazai cautiously chose his words \"Was the orphanage... bad?\"\n\"Very. They hurt me and were very mean. But I got away and thanks to you I was able to start living a life that wasn't all full of darkness\"\n\"I- Oh... um\" Dazai really wanted to say something, he really did, but his throat had seemed to close up\n\"It's okay, you don't have to say anything. You've already helped enough\"\nWhy did people seem to read his mind all the damn time?\n\"Now, French preposition\" Atsushi started on the crossword\n\"Des. D- e- s\" Dazai spelled out for him\n\"Uhhhh... large antelope? Is that a bug?\"\nDazai smiled at the adult, even though what he had said was very silly, he wouldn't laugh at him. That would have been mean.\n\"No, it's a mammal and it looks similar to a deer. Um and the answer is a Gnu\"\n\"I have a feeling I might actually finish a crossword for once in my life\" Atsushi chuckled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\"Dazai?\"\nThe kid perked up from the couch and made his way to Kunikida's desk\n\"Yes?\"\n\"I need you to go to the presidents' office, we're gonna have some guests here and I don't want them to know you are like... this\" He said and gestured to the kid\n\"Oh... okay\"\nSensing a bit of insecurity, Kunikida spoke again\n\"There's nothing wrong with you, it's just...I want to keep you safe and that starts with keeping your identity a secret\"\n\"Oh, of course\" Dazai regained a little confidence\n\"Great. Well, the president is expecting you. You can take your bag too\"\n\"Okay, see you later\" The brunet smiled softly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hello, Dazai\" He heard the man say as soon as he opened the door\nThe kid gulped and hugged Kaiyo closer.\n It's not like Fukuzawa was bad, it's just... Dazai just felt quite intimidated. He had a complicated past with older men.\n\"H-hello um... mr president\" He stammered\n\"You can call be Fukuzawa, boy\" His voice was soft, making it easier for the brunet to relax a little\nDazai nodded as he sat down on the couch inside the office\n\"I like your penguin\"\nThe kid blushed and smoothed his fingers over the fur, immediately feeling a sense of calmness wash over him\n\"Thank you. His name is Kaiyo\"\n\"The ocean, how nice\" He chuckled softly\n\"Thank you\"\u00a0\nFukuzawa knew Dazai was anxious around him. A simple look would even do to know it and he was also aware he looked a little intimidating, especially for someone with a past like the brunets.\n\"I've finished all of my work for today, would you like to do something to pass the time?\"\nDazai slightly tilted his head in curiosity \"Like what?\"\nFukuzawa's eyes darted around the room, searching for things to do with the kid, and then, \"Would you like to read with me, Dazai?\"\nThe boy nodded eagerly\n\"Great. do you have a specific book you would like to read?\"\n\"Um... Im reading by myself The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\"\nFukuzawa hummed \"A classic, how are you liking it so far?\"\nDazai squirmed a little in his seat \"Its-its very nice but... the witch is a little scary\" He confessed\n\"I agree. I never liked her either\" He reassured the kid \"Is it okay if I come closer, Dazai?\"\nThe brunet nodded\nFukuzawa then got up and moved his chair so he would sit in front of him. Dazai then handed him his book and he started reading.\nAfter 40 minutes of lecture the kids' eyes were starting to feel heavy, fighting to stay awake. Fukuzawa let him stay awake for a little longer because he seemed to really like the book, but when the kid really started to look exhausted, he closed the book and said:\n\"We'll continue another day. Why don't you take a nap? Kunikida told me you had a rough night\"\nIf it weren't for the fact that he was sleepy as hell, Dazai would've been embarrassed, so he only laid down on the couch and hugged Kaiyo closer to his chest as he closed his eyes.\nThe kid hummed \"Kunikida is very nice\"\nThe adult chuckled softly and placed a fuzzy blanket over the kid.\n\"He's always had a soft spot for you. All of us have, actually\"\n\"M'glad\" The kid slurred his words together\nIt brought a smile to the presidents face\n\"Now go to sleep, my boy\"\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What movie are we watching?\" Asked the kid as he plopped down on the couch, hot milk in one hand, Kaiyo in the other\n\"Big Dazai's favourite movie\" Kunikida smiled as he set the popcorn on the table and turned on the tv\n\"Really? Which one is it?\" His eyes widened in surprise\n\"Spirited Away. Big Dazai told me he watched it when he was 16 with a friend and its a very happy memory he has\"\n\"Oh... who did I watch the movie with?\"\n\"Someone named Chuuya\"\n\"Are we good friends?\"\nKunikida suppressed a snort, a little more than friends from what he had heard.\n\"Extremely good friends\"\nDazai seemed to be satisfied as no more questions were added\nAnd then the movie started:\n\"Wait! They got turned into pigs!?\"\n\"Why is the baby so... um big?\"\n\"The dragon is obviously Haku\"\n\"Did he just... he-he just ate the frog!\"\n\"Really, why is the baby so big?\"\nIt was both heartbreaking and heartwarming watching the seven-year-old enjoy the movie. One part of him adored how the kids eyes lit up and reacted so strongly to everything on screen and the other part of him was upset that Dazai seemed so starved of entertainment that it looked like it was his first time watching a movie.\nWhen No-face went rouge Dazai had a bit of a scare.\nHe flinched as he pressed against Kunikida's side, hoping it would keep him safe.\nThe blond smiled down at the kid and got the courage to rub his back and try and soothe him.\nWhen he did he felt the kid tense under his touch and was about to pull away when Dazai finally leaned a little closer to him.\nThis was a huge win.\nKunikida rubbed soft circles on the kids back, watching as he leaned further and further on him until his head was in the blonds lap.\n\"Don't worry, he looks scary but he doesn't mean any harm\"\n\"If you say so\" He muttered, voice muffled by Kaiyo's fur\nWhen the movie ended Dazai was sound asleep in Kunikidas lap\n\"Buddy?\"\nDazai stirred a little\n\"Dazai?\"\n\"Mmmhh?\"\n\"I'm going to carry you to your room. Is that okay?\"\nKunikida really didn't want to mess up now.\n\"Mmhh\"\nThe blond proceeded to scoop Dazai into his arms and walked to his room, the kid instinctively clung to him like he was going to disappear into thin air.\nKunikida then placed the brunet on his bed and tucked him into bed.\n\"I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep, don't worry\" He reassured the kid, softly combing his brown bangs out of his face\nDazai unconsciously smiled at the sentenced and snuggled with Kaiyo\n\"Mm'safe... right?\"\nPride swelled up in Kunikida's chest\n\"Yes, yes you are\"\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY\n\n\n\nIt was a warm day today in Yokohama. As a direct result, they both had cold milk and fruit for breakfast and now the blond was sitting in the living room, working on a case on his computer, watching how Dazai read a poetry book from his collection. And even though Kunikida was working, he couldn't focus on the papers in front of him because something was off.\nSomething was bugging Dazai.\nHe looked as tense as ever and he had barely said a word, which right now was preoccupying as the kid was the most talkative during the morning. He first thought it might have been a nightmare but scratched that option as he remembered how the kid had slept soundly through the night.\nSo the other option is that something must have triggered bad memories for him, which made Kunikida feel nauseous. He was going through everything he had done or said to the kid in the past 24 hours, searching for faults or changes in behavior, but he couldn't even think of one.\n\"What is it, Dazai?\" Kunikida asked, not looking up from his computer\nThe voice startled the kid. Making him look up to the adult.\n\"Uh-I ...Im fine?\" He heard the kid reply, voice trembling\n\"I can hear you thinking from here\"\n\"That's impossible\" He muttered, eyebrows furrowed\n\"No it's not. I know what you're thinking of\"\n\"Wait... really?\"\nKunikida seemed so serious Dazai has started to believe him.\n\nCould it be part of his ability?\n\n\nDid he hear thoughts?\n\n\nOh no\n\n\nHe was in so much troub- \n\n\"Yes. You're thinking about cows\" He deadpanned\nDazai giggled and seemed to relax a little\n\"No... Im not Kenji\" He replied with a slight smile on his face\n\"Oh, my bad. I was certain I was in the right\" Kunikida replied from his seat\nAfter some silence, Dazai decided to speak again.\n\"Im uncomfortable\" He finally confessed\n\"Why are you uncomfortable?\"\n\"I wish I could cover them up\" He whispered\n\nOh\n\n\nHis scars.\n\nThey were visible today because the blond has picked out a shirt with short sleeves because of the hot weather.\nKunikida gulped, it was a delicate subject.\nThe blond knew that even for big Dazai it was a taboo topic and all of the agency avoided all sorts of conversation around it.\nNot because they couldn't handle it or they felt uncomfortable, but because every time someone had brought up his scar or bandages Dazai's mood quickly shifted and he stayed awfully quiet for the rest of the day.\nEven though most of them he had obtained from an older age, there were still a significant amount of scars on his body right now. Way too many for a man, even more for a 7-year-old.\nThe positive thing is that there weren't many self-harm scars except for a scratching tic he had whenever he was extremely anxious.\nKunikida stopped typing and turned around to look at the boy\nUpon the attention Dazai squirmed a little and avoided his gaze\n\"Why is that, Dazai?\"\nThe kid gulped\nHe really didn't want to talk about it\nHe felt too exposed\n\"Pe-people stare. A lot. I hate it, it makes me feel like Im not... like Im no longer human\" He confessed\n\"But you are\"\nDazai shrugged it off\n\"They're ugly. They remind me of bad things and they sometimes hurt. I know it's psychological but it feels so real\"\nKunikida sighed \"No one here will stare at you Dazai and they're not ugly. Everyone in the agency has scars, but because of you're lack of eye contact you can't really spot them\"\nDazai frowned, he was about to complain when the blond spoke again\n\"But if you want to cover them up, I won't stop you\"\n\"Oh... really?\"\nKunikida's eyes softened \"Of course, we wouldn't want to make you uncomfortable. Just know that no one will ever think any less of you because of your scars\"\nDazai felt a lump in his throat as he nodded.\n\nWhy was everyone so nice?\n\n\"Th-Then do you have long gloves or bandages I cou-\"\n\"No\"\nDazai blinked\nFrom personal experience and big Dazai's comments, Kunikida knew the bandages were uncomfortable for the brunet. The texture was rough and it itched, often leaving his skin sorer than before.\n\"I have a better idea\" He stood up and walked to his room\nWhen he came back he had a small bag with the logo that Dazai recognised: it was the clothing store they had gone together on his first day\n\"I didn't want to give it to you today because it's going to be warm but its better than itchy bandages and the material is a little thinner than the others, so it won't be too hot\"\nHe grabbed what was inside the bag and Dazai's eyes shimmered\nIt was a pastel purple sweater, indeed not too thick, with little flowers adorning the sleeves and neck and on the center, there was a picture of a baby penguin with a scarf.\n\"Now you'll match with Kaiyo\"\n\"I-its so pretty\" The kid whispered, \"Can I try it on?\"\nKunikida nodded \"Of course, it's all yours\"\nDazai quickly put the sweater on and delightedly rubbed the sleeves against his face, closing his eyes at the contact.\nA gentle smile slowly formed on his face\n\"It's so soft\" He murmured\n\"I guessed you'd like it\"\nYeah that's a lie, he hadn't guessed. He had watched multiple times how Dazai cringed at rough textures. How his hands unconsciously fidgeted with everything soft and smooth (cue Kaiyo).\n\"I do, thank you very much\"\nKunikida smiled back at the kid, and let his mind wander.\nIf only someone had helped him, saved him. If only someone had noticed the kid was hurting, they could have avoided Dazai so much sufferi-\n\"Now, because I don't want you to overheat we will be taking the car. So get your bag because we're leave in 5 minutes\"\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYosano had finally come back from a mission outside of Yokohama and she was ecstatic to meet again the little genius. Her partners had been telling her all about his adventures and improvements and what she needed to avoid. Even though when Dazai was older he seemed to be wary of the doctor it didn't seem like it would be a problem now. Yosano was aware it probably had to do with Mori and him being a doctor too, but luckily at the age of 7 Dazai hadn't yet met the awful man.\nAs she entered the room she immediately spotted Dazai, who was snuggled up on the couch playing happily with a plushie. He looked a lot better than when she first saw him. It didn't seem that he was anxious around any agency members and he looked a little healthier.\u00a0\n\nYosano quickly greeted her coworkers and walked to the couch. Dazai immediately sensed her and looked up. She noticed how his body tensed for a few seconds, but when he realised who she was, his shoulders slumped back down.\n\"Hello Dazai. Do you remember me?\" She spoke softly\nHe nodded \"You are Yosano, you work with me... well, big me\"\n\"Exactly. I had a job outside Yokohama and I left for a few days but how are things here?\" Yosano asked, sitting down beside him, still leaving a safe distance between them\n\"Good. Everyone is very nice and Kunikida makes very good food\"\n\"I've tasted his food and I have to agree, he's certainly talented\" She smiled at him\nHe had improved quite a lot for only spending a few days with the agency. Yosano was glad he was starting to open up.\n\"Do you know what my job is?\"\n\"I think I do\" Dazai said, fidgeting with Kaiyo's bow\n\"What do you think it is?\"\n\"Are you a... doctor?\"\u00a0\n\"Correct, Dazai. Do you like medicine?\"\n\"I- I've read a few books about it but I still have lots to learn\"\n\"Well, why don't we come to the infirmary and I can teach you a bit? \"\nThe kid's eyes lit up, hope glowed in them. It made Yosano's heart flutter.\n\"Can I?\"\n\"Yes. Only if you want to, of course \" She clarified\u00a0\nHe nodded eagerly\n\"Um... Can I bring Kaiyo with me?\"\n\"Certainly. He's very cute, he matches your jumper\"\n\"Thank you, Kunikida picked it out for me\"\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nIn her office, Dazai was sat in the bed, with his legs dangling down and the penguin in his arms. His eyes curiously darted around the room but he didn't seem anxious or tense.\nYosano then opened a cabinet and took out an apparatus, showing it to the kid.\n\"Do you know what this is? I won't get angry if you don't know it\"\nDazai squinted his eyes \"I... that's a laryngoscope... I think\"\n\"You are right, and what are they used for?\" She encouragingly smiled at him\n\"For a... tra- ummm....tra...cheal intubation?\" He stammered out, still unsure of the pronunciation\n\"Correct. Would you like me to test you on more apparatuses?\"\n\"Uh...\" He fidgeted nervously with Kaiyo \"If I get them wrong, will you get angry? Will there be any punishment?\"\nThe doctors chest ached at those words.\n\"Absolutely not. If you get any wrong, I'll simply tell you the right answer and we'll move on. Sounds okay?\"\nDazai nodded eagerly\nThe pair spent the rest of the morning talking about medicine and with every minute that passed Dazai grew more comfortable around the doctor. She was very nice and patient, and extremely intelligent. The brunet had learned a lot in just a few hours and he couldn't wait to tell Kunikida about it.\u00a0\n\nWhen it was time to leave, Yosano was packing up her things with Dazai still in her office. He had spent the rest of the afternoon reading a few books the raven had about surgeries and other medical procedures.\u00a0\n\"Are you going to be here tomorrow?\"\nShe hummed in response\n\"Could... If y-you want to. Um... c-could we do this again? Maybe? I- if you don't mind\" He stuttered anxiously\n\u00a0\"Of course Dazai, I would love to\" The kid visibly relaxed \"You know Im going to have to do some extra research because I have a feeling that in a day or two you'll know more than I do\"\nHis eyes widened in surprise \"I- you think so?\"\u00a0\n\"Yes, you are a very bright boy Dazai, don't doubt yourself\"\n\"But- but people don't like smartasses\" He lowered his head, bringing Kaiyo closer to him\nYosano's eyes softened \"Honey, you're not a smartass\"\n\"But-\"\n\"You're not. Sometimes people say mean things because they feel intimidated by you.\"\n\"I... Im not sure I intimidate people\" He grimaced\u00a0\n\"Do you try to seem more intelligent than others, in a way that's annoying?\" She cocked an eyebrow\u00a0\nDazai's gaze snapped back to her\n\"No! I... I just want to help...\"\n\"Well then, you're not a smartass. You're a tiny genius, there's a big difference\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter dinner and a warm cup of milk and honey, Dazai was tucked in his bed with Kaiyo hugged to his chest. The blond had been reading his bedtime story for 10 minutes but the kid didn't look completely satisfied. Something seemed to be eating him alive but he decided not to pressure him and continued reading until he finally decided to speak up.\n\"Kunikida?\"\nHe looked up from the book \"Yes?\"\n\"I-Um ... last night um when I was going to sleep um y-you did something... could you do it again?\"\nKunikida was taken aback, unsure of what the child was trying to say\n\"Im sorry buddy but you're gonna have to speci- Oh, you mean playing with your hair?\"\nNow that the blond had said it out loud, the kid felt anxiety creep up his gut. He was being way too selfish and carefree. Kunikida had been so nice to him and all he was doing was testing his patience.\n\"I-Im sorry I- I um you- forget it\" He hurried out\nKunikida's eyes softened\n\"It's okay Dazai. I don't mind. Would you like me to play with your hair?\"\nUnable to get words out, he nodded\n\"Well then, close your eyes and try to relax, okay?\"\nDazai closed his eyes and hugged Kaiyo closer\nThe moment a hand came into contact with his hair he unintentionally flinched backward and snapped his eyes open.\u00a0\n\nStupid Dazai\n\n\nStupid Dazai\n\n\nKunikida hate you\n\nHis breathing was ragged \u00a0\"Sorry! I- my um-... People used to hurt me by pulling my hair very hard. I thought I could do it but... Yesterday I was very sleepy and um.... \" He chocked out\n\nHe hates you\n\n\nHe hates y-\n\n\"Shh... Im not mad. Breathe buddy, breath\" Kunikida's voice was gentle and there was no look of anger on his face\nWhen the kid seemed to snap out of his panic, Kunikida spoke again.\n\"Do you still want to continue or would you like to stop? I won't get mad either way\"\u00a0\n\"I-I need a second, pleased\" He whispered\n9 minutes later the kid had gestured that he was okay to go and Kunikida brought as softly as possible his hand up to the kids face.\nDazai shut his eyes as tightly and whimpered at the contact. His brain expected the hard tug.\nBut it never came.\n\"Shhhh... Im never going to hurt you. You're safe\" The blond reassured him \"Would you like me to continue talking?\"\n\"Please\" He faintly whispered\nA little later Dazai felt himself relaxing under the touch, slightly leaning into it.\u00a0\n\"Mmm... During the weekend Atsushi will come and spend some time home. He said you wanted to play with him?\"\nHe nodded, focusing on the tender hand combing through his brown locks.\n\"That sounds fun. You could even go and get some food in a cafe nearby. Have you tried strawberry milk before?\"\nDazai drowsily shook his head\n\"I'll tell Atsushi to get you some. I have the feeling you'll enjoy it\"\nA comforting, fuzzy feeling had started to appear in his belly, replacing the anxiety that was previously there.\u00a0\n\"One day we could have a picnic. Kenji could teach you how to make flower crowns\"\nDazai was now fully submerged in the feeling. Growing up people rarely touch him if it wasn't for... discipline matters, so just this simple touch had him on could 9.\u00a0\nHe fell asleep 10 minutes later.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nFRIDAY\n\u00a0\n\"Good morning Dazai, how did you sleep?\" Kunikida asked from the kitchen table as a still very sleepy Dazai appeared with Kaiyo in his hands\n\"G'morning. I slept well, thank you\" He replied, rubbing the tiredness out of his eyes\n\"Im glad. I've bought you chocolate milk for breakfast, would you like some?\"\nDazai nodded enthusiastically, making Kunikida chuckle a little.\n\"With an omelette?\"\u00a0\n\"Yes please\"\nThe blond stood up and walked to the fridge. He took the milk and set it on the kitchen table. He then made his way to the stove, starting to prepare their breakfast.\n\"I have an idea of what movie we can watch next\"\n\"Which one?\"\n\"You remember Spirited Away, right?\" The kid hummed behind him \"Well it's from the same studio. It's about a little boy who fi-\"\nHe was interrupted by a bang behind him and Kunikida's instincts kicked right in. He briskly\u00a0turned around and realised what had happened.\nThe mug slipped from his hands.\nIt came down with a loud crash, making Dazai flinch backward, back slamming against a kitchen cabinet. The sound made his skin crawl as memories from his past flooded his mind. His breathing shallowed and nausea formed in the pit of his stomach\nHe slid down and brought his knees up to his chest.\u00a0\n\"-zai? Dazai? Can you hear me?\"\nHe whimpered in distress\n\"It's okay. Nothing bad is going to happen\"\nHis tiny body was trembling in pure terror and his eyes were wide in panic.\u00a0\n\"Shh.... Calm down Dazai. You're okay, I'm not going to hurt you\"\n\nThe kid sobbed as he wrapped his hands around himself for protection. His lungs were burning and he felt his throat close up.\n\n\"Dazai, Im not going to hu-\"\n\"-I know\" He chocked out \"B-but m-memories... scary memories\"\nAlright. That was good (as good as it could be). At least Dazai wasn't scared of him.\n\"You're here with me. No one else, you're in my apartment. Buddy?\"\n\"Sc-scary\" He whimpered as he shook head \"Scary, scary, scary, scary\"\n\"I know, but it'll soon be okay\"\nHe whined in response\n\"Dazai?\u00a0Can you tell me four you can see?\"\nNo answer came from the kid, so the blond insisted\n\"It's going to help with the scary memories, I promise. Now, four things you can see\"\nHe hiccuped as his unfocused eyes roamed around the room.\n\"Ch-chair... Do-or... table... floor\"\n\"Good job! Excellent, buddy. Now, three things you can feel?\"\nHe sobbed \"Jump-jumper... ca-abinet... so-ocks\"\n\"Great! Two things you hear?\"\nThe kid was still crying but his eyes looked less panicked\u00a0\n\"Fridge.... C-cars?\"\n\"Well done. Now finally, one thing you can smell?\"\n\"M-mint soap\"\n\"That's it... good job. I've got Kaiyo here, would you like to hold him?\"\nHe nodded and Kaiyo was soon in his arms. He clutched him as hard as possible and ran his shaking fingers through his fur in a soothing pattern.\nKunikida stayed with him until his crying ceased and handed him a cup with chocolate milk, which the kid gladly took and drank.\n\"Why don't you lay down on the couch and I play with your hair? Does that sound nice?\"\nDazai nodded and got headed down to the living room.\nKunikida messaged the agency to tell them there had been an incident and how they might not come in today.\nWith that done he walked towards where the brunet was lying down. He sat down next to the kid and gave him a small smile.\n\"You did great back there, Dazai. I know it was very scary but you managed to get through it. Im proud of you\"\nThe words seemed to make the kid freeze up again although nothing came out of his mouth, but Kunikida could tell what he was thinking.\n\"Yes Dazai, Im proud of you. Now, do you still want me to play with your hair?\"\nThe kid nodded again and Kunikida brought a hand to his head and combed through his hair. The soothing gesture made his eyes flutter close and the tension in his body leave, and before he knew it, he had fallen asleep.\nHours later he woke up again with the blond still next to him.\u00a0\n\"Hey kid, how are you feeling?\" Kunikida gave him a small smile\nDazai gave him a weak thumbs up\n\"Is it okay if we go to the agency or would you rather stay home with me?\"\nThe kid showed the number one with his fingers\n\nAgency, great\n\n\"Okay, can I pick you up?\"\nDazai nodded as he rubbed his eyes.\nThe blond then proceeded to search for the softest blanket he had in his house and gently wrapped Dazai in it\n\"Come on kid, up you go\" Kunikida gently swooped the kid up into his arms\nDazai nuzzled closer, the warmth of the blanket and the blonds embrace lulling him back to sleep once more.\nKunikida again chose to drive to work even if that meant getting stuck in traffic because he couldn't bring the kid to leave the comfort of the embrace\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hey tiny Dazai, what's the matter?\" Ranpo asked in an unusually soft tone as he kneeled down in front of the kid\nOne thing that the whole agency had learned is that Ranpo had an unusual gentle side with Dazai.\nNot with kids, Ranpo\u00a0hated\u00a0 kids.\nBut Dazai was different.\u00a0\n\nThere were many different reasons why he tolerated the brunet, but one of the main ones was that he knew that if he and Dazai would have met back then when they were younger, they would have been friends.\u00a0\nHe knew Dazai understood him, better than people did even nowadays.\u00a0\nSeeing that Dazai didn't reply and only look at the blond and he replied for him\n\"We were making breakfast and a mug broke, so he had a bit of a scare\"\nDazai nodded in agreement\n\"Ohhhh... that must have sucked. You know, Im going to tell you a secret: Kunikida has broken the coffee machine more times than he's had coffee\"\nA little smile began to form on the kids face, the first one today\n\"And Atsushi broken three computers in a month\" Ranpo grinned\nDazai's eyes widened as he looked at the weretiger who was sitting at his desk\n\"Uh... yeah. I've spilled my tea a couple of times\" He confessed sheepishly\n\"So don't worry, everyone here makes mistakes, tragically, even me, so we're never going to punish you for such silly things\"\n\"What have you done?\" Kunikida cocked his eyebrows\n\"I may or may not have taken my hot chocolates with salt instead of sugar\"\n\"Chocolates? Its happened more than once?\" Kunikida couldn't help but tease the raven\n\"I was tired!\"\nDazai unconsciously smiled at Ranpo, he really liked the detective.\n\"Would you like a hug?\" Ranpo asked\nDazai nodded as he walked into the ravens' arms. Ranpo quickly engulfed the tiny kid into a hug and picked him up.\nInstinctively, Dazai hid his face in the crook of his neck and wrapped his legs around him as the older genius walked to the couch and sat down.\nOnce they were seated Ranpo gently nudged the kid so he would listen to him.\n\"I've got my heavy blanket in the office, would you like to try it out? It feels very nice and has a soft texture\"\nDazai nodded and Ranpo made a gesture to the weretiger who brought him his blanket. The raven then draped it over himself and the kid.\n\"Mmmm. It feels... nice\" Remarked the brunet, snuggling closer into the embrace\n\"I know. Like a very, very good hug, right?\"\nRanpo felt the kid nod\u00a0\n\n\"You can go to sleep, tiny Dazai. The agency's got your back\"\nWith that said, Ranpo ended up falling asleep too. The heavy blanket was really doing its toll and it had been a while since he had slept for more than a good 4 hours.\nNo one in the agency had the heart to wake up neither of the geniuses, so they slept until lunch peacefully.\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nSATURDAY\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAtsushi had brought Dazai to the park right after lunch to make sure there weren't too many kids to overwhelm him but it was impossible to find an empty park on a Saturday, so a few of them were running around.\nThe weretiger sat on a bench as he searched in his backpack and pulled out a book he had been planning to read while the brunet played.\u00a0\nBut Dazai didn't seem to budge.\n\"Um...Dazai? Why don't you go play on the monkey bars? I'll be watching you from here\" Atsushi suggested\nDazai fidgeted with the hem of his shirt, his gaze fixated on the ground.\nNo words came out of his mouth, so Atsushi insisted.\n\"Dazai? Whatever it is I won't get mad at you\"\nDazai still didn't look up, it even looked like he made himself smaller\n\"Kids are scary\" He muttered, hoping he didn't have to explain himself more\nRight, the park wasn't empty\u00a0\n\"Oh! Would you like me to play with you?\" Atsushi questioned\nDazai looked up, hope shimmered in his eyes\n\"You mean you're would go on the slides with me?\"\n\"Um... yeah, and all of the things you want to try\"\n\"Okay, thank you Atsushi\" Dazai gave him a little smile as both of them made their way to the park activities\nThe weretiger knew Dazai was a genius, even at this young age, but the simplicity of the playground had him captivated. It made his heart ache, the child had been completely starved from entertainment, and everyday that passed Atsushi could see more and more similarities between them, which wasn't good in any way and it made him realise something; No matter what, Atsushi was gonna make sure Dazai had a proper childhood (or for at least two weeks)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n***\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs they walked back towards Kunikida's apartment the weretiger had noticed how the kid had started to lag behind and was occasionally tripping over his own feet.\n\"Dazai?\"\nHe looked up at him, rubbing his right eye\n\"Are you sleepy?\"\nDazai broke eye contact, clearly uncomfortable\n\"No\" He lied\n\"You're not in trouble, I was just wondering if you would like me to carry you\"\n\"I can walk\" He insisted\nAtsushi chuckled soflty\n\"That's not what I asked you. Would you like me to carry you for a little? I don't mind\" Atsushi suggested again\nDazai nodded and muttered a \"yes please\"\nThe weretiger scooped the little kid into his arms as he hugged him closer. Dazai wrapped his legs around him and his hands right away started to play with Atsushi's hair as he walked again\n\"Its so soft\" He whispered\n\"Huh? My hair?\"\nAtsushi felt the kid nod\n\"Thanks, Im not sure what I do to keep it soft. Pure luck I guess\"\nDazai hummed against him, his little fingers gently twisting the white strands of hair\n\"Do you like soft things?\"\nHe nodded again\n\"Ranpo does too. Well it isn't always soft textures, we just know there are very specific ones he likes and doesn't like\"\n\"I know\"\n\"Oh?\"\n\"Uh...I- he told me and it happens to me too but back then they- they.... no one cared if I liked something or not\"\n\"You know we do, right?\"\nDazai hugged him tighter \"Yes\"\n3 minutes later he was out like a light in his arms\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUNDAY\n\n\"What would you like to do?\"\nThe weretiger had been called later on today because Kunikida had a meeting to attend until late at night, so he needed someone to look after the kid. After a peaceful dinner together Dazai had changed into his pyjamas and was sitting next to Atsushi on the sofa\nHe shrugged, fiddling with the hem of his shirt\n\"Mmm... would you like to play?\"\nHe didn't answer and only squirmed in his seat, clearly uncomfortable\n\"Hey, I don't mind what we do, so if you won't want to play we don't have to, okay?\"\n\"I don't wanna play, I'm a little sleepy\" He quietly confessed\n\"Okay that's absolutely fine... Um, how does a movie sound?\"\nDazai's eyes lit up and he nodded\n\"Great! Would you like to choose?\"\nHe shook his head, that type of responsibility made him anxious.\n\"Could we avoid scary things? Please?\" He asked with such as a small voice that Atsushi felt like crying\n\"Of course, Dazai. Im not going to make you watch anything bad\"\nAtsushi settled on Despicable Me and played once both of them were seated comfortably.\n10 minutes in Dazai kept fidgeting in his seat. His gaze was fixated on the tv but Atsushi knew something was on his mind.\n\"Is something wrong?\"\nDazai's head whipped to look at him\n\"Can... Can I sit with you, please?\" His voice trembled a bit\nAtsushi almost cried tears of joy\n\"Of course, come here\" The weretiger extended his arms\nDazai happily sat on his lap and melted into the comforting embrace and finally seemed to fully enjoy the movie, as he giggled when he saw a minion appear on screen\n\nHe's so freaking adorable\n\n\"They're so silly\" The kid chipped as he shuffled closer to the weretiger\n\"Pretty funny, right?\"\nDazai nodded, completely absorbed by the movie.\nA little later the brunet was fighting against his sleep, struggling to keep his eyes open. It had been amusing for a while but when Atsushi checked the clock he realised it was pretty late for him to be up.\n\"Kunikida told me you like to drink a glass of warm milk with honey before bed, would you like me to make it for you?\"\nThe kid bit his lip nervously\n\"But it makes me sleepy\" He whined\nAtsushi chuckled\n\"You're already sleepy\"\n\"Sleepy-er\" The kid corrected with a small pout on his face\n\"Don't worry, if you fall asleep we'll continue the movie tomorrow, okay? Its pretty late\"\n\"Okay\" He finally agreed, and Atsushi made his way to the kitchen\nWhen he came back Dazai had wrapped himself in a blanket\nDazai slowly drank the beverage completely at peace and when he finished Atsushi put away the cup and he climbed back on his lap.\nWhat surprised him is that the kid instead of watching the movie, he turned the other way, curling into Atsushi's chest. The weretiger brought as gently as possible a hand up to the kid's face and cradled his cheek. Dazai tensed for a second and then snuggled closer to him, a small smile beginning to form on his face.\n\"It feels nice\" He confessed\n\"Touch is supposed to feel nice\" Atsushi spoke with a low voice\n\"It never did until you guys appear\"\n\nDon't cry Atsushi, hold back the tears\n\n\"Im glad we are friends\" The kid whispered\nAtsushi felt his heart swell \"Me too, Dazai\"\nThe warm hand stroking his cheek was making the kid feel like he was in heaven\n\"Are yo-... you're gonna keep me safe, right?\"\u00a0\nHe hummed in agreement\n\"No one is going to hurt me anymore?\" Atsushi could hear the fear in his voice\u00a0\n\"No one\" The weretiger replied with a firm tone\n\"Okay\" He seemed satisfied \"G'night sushi\"\nHis heart leaped in his chest\n\"Goodnight Dazai, sleep tight\"\nAtsushi softly rocked the kid and with his free hand, he continued to caress his cheek. Needless to say, he fell asleep in a matter of minutes but the weretiger didn't have the heart to move the kid from his embrace. He knew Dazai was severely touch starved, and when he was touched it never was for a good reason, so all he wanted to do is to hug the kid forever and erase all the harm that had caused him.\nWhen Kunikida arrived home he found Atsushi and Dazai dead asleep on the couch. He carefully moved the kid to his bed.\nThe kid stirred a little and slightly opened his eyes \"Mmm?\"\n\"Shhhh... sleep, buddy. I'll keep you safe\"\nDazai nodded and closed his eyes again. Once Kunikida was sure he had fallen back asleep he returned to the living room and then draped a blanket over Atsushi.\u00a0\n\"Goodnight kid\" He whispered\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n***\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nMONDAY\n\n\n\n\n\"Kunikida? What's for dinner?\" Dazai asked as he skipped into the kitchen with Kaiyo in his arms\n\"Omelette and sausages, does that work for you?\"\nDazai hungrily nodded \u00a0\"Yes, thank you\"\nHe walked over to where Kunikida was making the omelets and peaked over the counter, his curious eyes looking at him\n\"Would you like to help me?\" He suggested\n\"Yes please!\"\nThe blond then moved a stool towards the counter where the bowl with eggs were and placed the kid on top.\n\"Alright, is pretty simple, just mix the eggs until I tell you. And don't worry if something goes wrong, the first time I cooked an omelet I made my father throw up\"\nDazai giggled as took the bowl into his hands and started mixing it. He seemed extremely concentrated in such a simple task; his head was slightly tilted and his tongue was sticking out. It was quite amusing to watch.\nAfter a minute or so Kunikida stopped the kid and moved on to cooking the sausages\n\"Now, I'll work on this alone, but you and Kaiyo can look from afar\" Ordered the blond as he started to warm up the stove\nDazai cocked his head in curiosity\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because the oil is very hot and when the sausages fry it makes it jump out of the pan and can burn you\"\nHe furrowed his eyebrows \"I can still help, I've been burnt before\"\nKunikida felt a pang in his heart\n\"Remember Dazai, I don't want you to get hurt. I want to keep you safe\"\nThe brunet nodded, letting once again Kunikida's words sink in.\n\nHe wanted to keep him safe\n\n\nSafe\n\nThe kid didn't reply, but a little warm feeling in his chest was starting to spread.\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nDuring dinner Kunikida attentively listened to the kid tell him all of the things that had happened today when he wasn't around. Dazai had a small smile on his face while he talked and his whole body looked relaxed and the blond had recently found out that that was one of his favourite things, seeing the kid content.\n\"And then spent like 30 minutes talking about cows!\" He chimed, shoving food in his mouth\n\"Yes, he can actually go on for longer\"\u00a0\n\"I can't even talk that much about them!\" He exclaimed making Kunikida chuckle\n\"Well, I've heard you talk to Ranpo for almost an hour about frogs\" He teased\nDazai scoffed \"That's because frogs are awesome\"\n\"Really? What makes them so awesome?\" Kunikida asked, taking a bite from his omelet \n\"Be-because they can jump super high!.... Oh! And they come in different colours! I bet you've never seen a green cow\"\nKunikida shook his head \"I have not. But I have seen a purple cow\"\n\"Haaah?\" Dazai looked at him as his jaw went slack\nKunikida chuckled softly \"It's a joke. The logo of a Swiss chocolate is a purple cow\"\n\"Oh, I think its the first time I've heard you tell a joke\"\n\"Yeah, usually you are the one that's good with humor\"\nDazai beamed \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, you can crack a smile even on the most heartless of people\" Kunikida watched as the kid's mouth curved into a smile\n\"Kunikida?\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Does big Dazai have a girlfriend?\"\nThe blond choked on his food\nWhen he looked at the kid he realised that he looked... upset?.... anxious? He couldn't really crack it. Kunikida cleared his throat before speaking again. This was not a conversation he wanted to have.\n\"Um.... no-no he doesn't\" He said and watched as Dazai's eyes lit up again\n\"I don't?\"\n\"No, you don't. But um...\" He cleared his throat again \"Big Dazai hasn't told me directly, but he has a boyfriend\"\nThis time it was Dazai's turn to choke with the food.\n\"Wh- wait, what?.... i-its it's al... I can?\" The kid was at a loss for words and Kunikida soon realised why\u00a0\n\nOh, fuck\n\n\"Of course, you're free to love whoever you want, regardless of their gender\"\u00a0\n\"I...That's- I... I thought you- you couldn't... right?... I....\" He stumbled on his words, completely taken aback by the news he had just heard\n\nThis poor child\n\n\"You were told you couldn't like boys, Dazai?\" Kunikida asked carefully\u00a0\nDazai nodded, eyes starting to shimmer with tears \"They-they said I was b-bad because I like boys. Well, that's one of the reasons\" He muttered\n\"Dazai... Im so s-\"\n\"-Can I have a hug, please?\" He asked urgently as his voice cracked\nKunikida nodded and extended his arms \"Come here buddy\"\nThe brunet jumped into the hug, burying his face in Kunikida's chest. The blond protectively wrapped his arms around the kid and his hand automatically stroked his brown locks. Even though no sobs came out he could feel the brunet shudder in his embrace. He wasn't surprised. To realise that something that had basically been engraved into your skull is completely untrue must be overwhelming and difficult to accept.\u00a0\n\"Dazai, you are the bravest person I know\"\n\"What?\" His voice quivered\n\"I know a lot of people have been very mean to you and they've hurt you a lot, but you managed to make it through. You've found your family kid. We don't care who you love, we just want you to be happy\"\n\"I wish I could have grown up with you guys\" Dazai confessed, tightening his grip\n\"Me too \"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt 3:29am Dazai woke up from a nightmare\n\n\"-nikida?!\"\nThe blond heard a scream\n\n\"Kunikida?!\"\nWithout second notice he was up on his feet, bolting his way towards the kids room. When he stepped inside the room he saw Dazai sat on his bed, clutching Kaiyo as tears streamed down his pale face. The second the kids eyes focused on Kunikida he jumped out of bed and shoved himself into the man's arms, gripping his shirt as if he were to disappear into thin air.\n\"Shhh... Im here. You're safe, no one is going to hurt you\"\nKunikida was trying really hard not to not lose focus but so many things had happened in less than a minute. The fact that Dazai had called him for comfort, for safety and not caring if it had woken him up had amazed him. This had been one of his biggest improvements yet and the fact that it was such a simple action like calling for help made his chest ache.\nA whine from the child brought him back to reality\n\"Hey buddy? Can you hear my heartbeat?\" His tone was incredibly soft, it had become kind of a habit now\nHe nodded\n\"Try to only focus on that, okay?\"\nDazai nodded again, sobs making his small body tremble\n\"Good job... You're okay, you're safe. Im not leaving you\" He reassured him, rocking the kid gently from side to side. He had one hand cradling his head and the other one on his back.\n15 minutes later the crying had died down to occasional hiccups. Kunikida had one hand cradling his head and the other one on his back rubbing soothing circles.\n\"Thank you for calling out for me, you did the right thing\" The blond broke the silence\nKunikida realised that he really must have acted out on impulse because as soon as he said those words Dazai froze in his arms.\n\"Oh...I... I... it came out on its own... I was very scared\" The brunets voice was raspy and raw from all the crying\n\"I know, but you did well. Im proud of you\"\nDazai's grip tightened but didn't seem to want to say anything else\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nTUESDAY\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nToday had been a pretty peaceful day.\u00a0\nBeing off-field meant that Kunikida could focus more on paperwork and now that Dazai was a quiet 7-year-old, the task was even easier to complete. It also meant that there were a bunch of people watching over Dazai, which was pretty convenient because the kid hated being alone. The blond had realised that Dazai had been so neglected that whenever he was alone for long periods of time, he'd go into an metdown, thinking they had abandoned him again.\n\nWhen they arrived home is when everything had gone south.\nFukuzawa had called him urgently saying that Atsushi had lost a report they were supposed to give to a lawyer early tomorrow morning. Of course, it had taken 2 and a half weeks for the poor boy to complete the full report, so it meant he couldn't have it for tomorrow.\u00a0\nHe couldn't have it for tomorrow if it weren't for Kunikida.\nSo as soon as the call ended Kunikida erased his whole schedule and moved all of his paperwork to the living room.\u00a0\nHe had started the report at 5:30 pm, and now, at almost 2 am, he was finally done. With a sigh, he took off his glasses and let his head fall back on the couch, letting the exhaustion finally take over his body. His breathing got progressively slower and he felt himself sinking deeper and deeper into the couch.\nHe would have fallen asleep if it weren't for the opening of what seemed Dazai's door.\nKunikida's parental instincts kicked right in as he snapped his eyes wide open and sat right up again.\n\"Dazai?\" He called out as he heard little footsteps walking towards him\nWhen the kid finally arrived to the living room the blond realised he was crying\n\nFuck\n\"Was I bad? Im-\" Dazai hiccuped as tears fell down his face \"Im sorry. I didn't mean to be bad\"\nKunikida's mind was going a million per hour.\n\nWhat had happened?\n\n\nHad he hurt him?\u00a0\n\n\nHad he said something mean?\n\n\"Wha- Of course not. Why would you think such thing, Dazai?\" Kunikida spoke slowly, like he was approaching an injured animal\nThe brunet let out a whine as he anxiously tugged on his pyjama sleeve.\u00a0\nHe didn't want to explain himself, it hurt too much.\n\"There wasn't-\" He hiccuped \"I didn't deserve a bedtime story. Im sor-sorry\"\n\nOh shit\n\n\nShit\n\nHe had completely erased it from his schedule by accident\n\"Dazai, Im so sorry. Of course, you deserve a bedtime story, I just had a lot of work and I forgot\" He clarified, but the kid in front of him was still tremendously worked up\n\"Would you like a hug, Dazai?\" He asked and the brunet nodded impatiently\u00a0\nKunikida picked him up, placed him on his lap, and brought him into a hug.\n\"Im bad, Im bad, I'm bad\" He frantically chocked out, gripping onto Kunikida's shirt\nEvery \"bad\"\u00a0 was a knife to Kunikida's heart.\nA loving hand began to comb through the kids hair and he already felt some tension leave his tiny body.\n\"No you're not. Calm down, Dazai. It was my fault, you did nothing wrong\"\nThe kid in his arms whimper as more tears fell from his eyes.\nKunikida gently rocked the kid back and forth hoping in order to soothe him.\nWith gentle words and soft touches the brunet finally stopped crying but he was still in Kunikida's arms, tightly clutching his shirt.\n\"Im sorry Dazai. You're not bad, okay? You deserve a bedtime story and all of the good things in life. Never think otherwise\"\n\"All of them?\" He asked with a small voice\n\nThe poor child\n\n\"Yes, all of them, and even more\" Kunikida reassured him \"Do you still want me to read to you? Or would you like to sleep?\"\u00a0\nDazai answered straight away\n\"Read, please\" He muttered\nKunikida smiled and nodded\nHe stood up with Dazai still in his arms and with one hand he grabbed the book and walked to the kid's room. When he was about to place Dazai on his bed but his grip seemed to tightened and he let out a little whine.\n\"Do you... Do you want to stay like this until you fall asleep?\"\u00a0\nAnd with the quietest voice possible he replied, \"Yes please\"\nSo Kunikida proceed to sit down on the kids' bed with Dazai still in his lap and picked up the book. Within the first few lines the kid's head had moved to his chest and now was comfortably cuddling against him.\u00a0\n30 minutes in he was almost out, so Kunikida placed the book on the nightstand and focused on rocking the kid to sleep, who didn't seem like he would be letting go any time soon of him.\nWith one hand he gently combed through his brown hair and said, \"You're not bad, Dazai. You'll never be\"\nAnd a few minutes later the kid was lulled to sleep by soft words and a lot of cuddles.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n***\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\n\u00a0\n\"So this is from my first job here?\" Dazai said as he sat next to Fukuzawa\nHe looked at a framed picture where he could see the president, Kunikida, a man he couldn't recognize, and himself. He looked like he was in his twenties and there was a forced smile plastered on his pale face.\nDazai had noticed the bandages on his future self but had made no comment about them. There was no need.\nHe had already put the pieces together himself.\n\"Yes, you were quite nervous\"\u00a0\nDazai giggled\n\"I look so stiff\" His little fingers ran through the glassed picture, tracing his own outline\n\"When we finished the job you went to the bathroom and threw up\" The older man explained\nDazai looked up and tilted his head in curiosity\n\"Why? Was the mission hard?\"\n\"No, on the contrary, it was one of the easiest you've had, but you were so scared you were going to disappoint me it made you sick\"\nDazai grimaced \"Hmm... that does sound like me\"\n\"But you've gotten better. You're not that nervous around us anymore and you know that whatever you do won't ever disappoint me\"\u00a0\n\"Why?\" He blurted out, feeling pretty puzzled\nBefore answering, the grey-haired man smiled at him and his eyes softened.\n\"Because I think of you as one of my own, Dazai\" He said\nThe kid was at a loss of words\n\"Wai-Really?\" He breathed out\n\"I would never lie to you. I've always appreciated you very much and I believe you're a brilliant boy who is kind at heart\"\u00a0\nDazai promptly wrapped his arms around him and then felt a grounding had rubbed against his back.\n\"I think of the agency as my own family, and Im proud to say that you are part of it\"\u00a0\n\"Does that mean that you are like our dad?\" Dazai chimed\nFukuzawa's whole body froze for a second and cleared his throat. He'd only had this conversation with Ranpo. He wasn't against being seen as a father figure, it had just taken him by surprise.\n\"If you want me too\" He smiled down at him\nDazai nodded and suddenly his whole face lit up\n\"Would...Does that mean Ranpo and Atsushi are like my brothers?\" He beamed, making Fukuzawa chuckle\n\"Yes, my boy\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter work, Kunikida had told Atsushi how he wanted to bring Dazai to a cute cafe that he would certainly enjoy, but after last nights events he was pretty worn out, so he had the silver-haired boy take him instead.\nAtushi walked hand in hand with Dazai, who was enthusiastically telling him a riddle Ranpo had made him do. It was a pretty complex one and the weretiger couldn't understand a single word that was being said to him, but the smile on the kid's face while he talked was absolutely priceless. He liked seeing Dazai so cheerful and acting his age.\n\"-a conceptual metaphor with the notion of something disappearing... its really simple if you really think about it\" He explained\n\"Hm... Im not sure I agree on the simple part\" Atsushi chuckled\n\"Sometimes the best option is to say it out loud! That way its-\" The weretiger froze in place\n\nDanger\n\nHis eyes widened as he realised who was standing opposite him.\n\"Weretiger! What are you doing here?\" Akutagawa snarled at him, making both of flinch\nAtsushi moved protectively in front of the boy, noticing how he had started to panic. His tiny body shook in fear.\n\"Akutagawa listen-\"\u00a0\n\"No! You listen! Im going to defeat you and when im do-\" His words died when he noticed the little boy crying, he was about to snap at him when something about the kid made him freeze in place\n\nWas it-?\n\n\nNo\n\n\nThat was stupid\n\n\nHow could it be him?\n\n\"P-p-please don't hurt him\" The kid begged as he hugged his plushie\nEven the voice sounded... familiar\n\"Is... Is\" Akutagawa couldn't even get the words out of his mouth\nAtsushi fully ignored him and kneeled in front of the kid. He had bigger problems than dealing with the emo rival.\n\"Hey, don't worry, he's not going to hurt me.... or you. Can I touch you?\" He spoke with a gentle tone\nThe brunet nodded and Atsushi brought a hand and cupped the boy's cheek, rubbing his thumb soothingly noticing how the kid melted into the touch.\n\"I-...you... \u00a0Sushi h-hurt?\" The kid stammered, full of distress\n\"No, no, Shhh... Everything's okay, none of us are in danger. Im not hurt\" He clarified\u00a0\nDazai shuffled closer towards Atsushi and the weretiger scooped him up into his arms, stroking his hair gently.\n\"Don't worry Dazai, it was just a misunderstanding. Right, Akutagawa?\" He called, hoping his enemy had understood what was happening.\nNow Akutagawa was the one on the verge of a panic attack\n\nThe kid was Dazai\n\n\nAnd he had made him cry\n\n\nHe had made Dazai cry\n\n\nDazai was crying because of him\n\n\nThe cause of Dazai's tears w-\n\n\"Akutagawa?\"\nThe raven coughed awkwardly \"Yes- I ...um, it was a.... misunderstanding. I didn't mean to scare you, im sorry\" He bowed his head\nAnd there was something in his tone that made Dazai stop crying.\nHe seemed... harmless? Now it looked like he was the one that was scared\nDazai sniffed and wiped his tears\u00a0\n\"Its okay... It was a mistake\" He said as he laid his head in Atsushi's shoulder\n\"Weretiger... how did... did he....\" Akutagawas mind was crashing\n\"Let's go to somewhere quiet... and let's do it peacefully\" He warned the raven, his tone was way harsher than before\nThe port mafia member nodded quickly\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nOnce they were seated down in the cafe Atsushi seemed to relax a little, his main priority was keeping the kid safe and relaxed and Akutagawa had seemed like an immediate threat but now.... now he was really just as anxious as Dazai was before.\nThe brunet was quietly drinking a glass with strawberry milk, pressed against Atsushi and was looking across at the raven with curious eyes.\n\"I like your coat\" He blurted out\nAkutagawa flushed at the statement and coughed\n\"I-I... Thank you\"\nAtsushi took a sip from his drink and looked at his rival\n\"Um... so the thing is Dazai got turned into a kid on Sunday. It was because of an ability user and there is no way to reverse it, we just have to wait for two weeks. I hope you understand the gravity of the-\"\n\"Of course\" Akutagawa snapped \"Im not a dumbass. I won't tell anyone, I have no intentions on hurting Dazai\"\nAnd suddenly:\n\"You look a little like a bat\" Dazai deadpanned, making Atsushi choke on his drink\n\"I.... um\" Akutagawa's cheeks reddened, eyes darting everywhere but at them both\n\"It's not a bad thing. I think bats are super cool\" Dazai explained, the corner of his mouth quirking up\n\"O-oh\" Akutagawa didn't know what else to say\n\"Akutagawa?\"\n\"Yes?\n\"You're like me\"\nAkutagawa froze and looked him dead in the eye\n\"What does that mean?\" His voice came out harsher than he intended\u00a0\n\"You're overwhelmed\"\nAkutagawa didn't respond.\u00a0\nThis kid was definitely Dazai.\u00a0\nI mean he hadn't doubted it before, but the ability to read him like an open book was exactly the one of his past mentor.\n\"It's okay, talking to people is scary, right?\" The kid gave him a gentle smile\n\"Yes...\" He confessed, avoiding Atsushi's gaze \"How did you know?\"\n\"Just a hunch..... And y-your body language\"\nAkutagawa scoffed\n\"You've always been good at reading me\"\nDazai frowned \"I have? So... I already knew you?\"\nHe coughed \"Yes. You were my mentor before you joined the agency\"\n\"Oh... Then-\" Something made Dazais whole face twist\nDazai went completely silent. His face paled as he looked at Akutagawa with wide eyes\n\"What is it?\" Asked the raven, growing a little impatient\u00a0\nAtsushi leaned forward a little so he could properly look at the kid \"What is it Dazai?\"\n\"I...\" His voice died again, nibbling his bottom lip\n\"Dazai?\"\n\"I wasn't nice to you... was I?\" He gulped full of dread as he already knew the answer\nAtsushi froze besides him and Akutagawa's face went completely blank\u00a0\n\"How did you know?\"\n\"From... from my own experience. We share a lot in common and um... a-all of my past mentors h-hurt me really bad so I... I connected the dots\" He stammered out, Kaiyo close to his chest\nThe raven hummed, not sure what to say\n\"Im sorry. Im so sorry I hurt you\" Dazai's eyes welled up\n\"Its okay. I grew stronger because of it. And you did it because you needed to survive\"\n\"No! But that's- that's wrong! I never wanted to do what they did to me! I didn't want to be bad! I don't want to be bad!\" He cried full of distress\nSensing how the kid was soon going to go into a state of panic, Atsushi intervened \u00a0\n\"Dazai, calm down. Can I touch you?\"\u00a0\nAs soon as the kid nodded, he gently brought him into a side hug, who instantaneously melted into the kind touch. He hid his face against Atsushi while fidgeting with Kaiyo.\n\"That's it... good job. Don't get worked up\" Atsushi mumbled\n\"Dazai, the world is a complicated place. It's never black and white... it's grey. You had no other option\"\u00a0\n\"But I-\"\nAkutagawa cleared his throat and glared at the kid.\u00a0\n\"I did the same thing. I mentored someone and I hurt them. Do you think Im bad?\"\nHalf of him regretted asking the question.\u00a0\n\nWhat if Dazai said yes?\n\n\nWhat if he was disgusted by him?\n\n\nWhat if he-\n\n\"No! No! I... b-but... You did it because I hurt you\" He hurried out\nRelief immediately washed over his body.\n\"And you did it because people hurt you\" Akutagawa let out a long tired sigh \"Dazai, I forgave you a long time ago... Sure, it still hurts, but I've learned to grow from it\"\n\"You shouldn't have forgiven me\" He whispered\nThe raven scoffed \"But that's not your choice to make\"\u00a0\nDazai whimpered. \"Im so sorry\"\nThis was never supposed to happen, he had promised himself. It made his skin crawl to know that he had turned into the men he feared the most.\n\"Ca-Can I give you a hug? I understand if you hate me and don't want-\"\n\"-Sure\" \u00a0The raven replied and a pair of lanky arms were quickly around him\u00a0\nAkutagawa couldn't remember the last time someone had hugged him. He was pretty aware he was touch starved, but when that becomes the norm in your day-to-day life you don't really make an effort to change it. (That doesn't mean that he doesn't melt every time Chuuya pats him on the head after he's done a good job)\n\"I know its hard,\u00a0but please try to understand in that big brain of yours that you're not bad, Dazai\"\nThe kid huffed \"You're not bad either\"\n\"Okay\" He breathed out, letting the kid cuddle against him as he calmed down\n\"I like the penguin\" Akutagawa spoke once he felt the kid relax\nDazai looked at the plushie and then at the raven\n\"His name is Kaiyo, he's very soft\"\n\"Mmmm, Does he also like bats?\"\nThe kid smiled gently and shook his head \"He's jealous of them because they can fly and he can't\"\n\"Is that so? But I bet Kaiyo has other nice qualities, right?\" Akutagawa asked, cocking his eyebrow\nThe brunet eagerly\u00a0nodded \"He knows all the animals in the arctic tundra\"\n\"Really? He must be quite smart\" He hummed\n\"Yes! And I think at night he becomes a super good spy\"\n\"But... if you know he's a spy he cant be that good\"\u00a0\nDazai's eyes widened in realisation \"No! Umm... that's because we are partners! So he can trust I won't tell anyone\"\n\"But you just revealed me the secret\" Akutagawa felt a small smile appear on his face\nDazai giggled as he covered his mouth in realisation\u00a0\nAtsushi watched them in complete astonishment. He had never seen Akutagawa so... gentle? Not to mention he had made Dazai laugh in only an hour of meeting him.\n\"Dazai...I believe you and Kaiyo should undergo proper spy training\" He said with a neutral tone\n\"How do I do that?\" He asked curiously as he tilted his head\n\"Well, there is a very important test every spy goes through. It's nothing harmful though. Would you like to try it?\"\nDazai looked at Atsushi, who encouragingly\u00a0smiled at him.\nHe looked back at the raven and nodded.\nAkutagawa then stood up and left both of the ADA members alone. A few minutes later he came back with a plate with two different kinds of cookies and placed them in the middle of the table.\n\"You have to tell me which one you think tastes better\" He concluded and soon all of them dug into the treat\nAfter Dazai tried them both, he looked at Akutagawa very seriously and said \"Chocolate is better, Kaiyo also agrees\"\n\"Vanilla is better\" Said Atsushi\nAkutagawa looked at both and then stated \"Dazai and Kaiyo both pass, Atsushi doesn't\"\n\"Haaah? That's completely biased!\" The weretiger was trying really hard to ignore that Akutagawa had called him by his name, but his cheeks were starting to heat up\n\"I don't care, chocolate is superior\" He scoffed\nSomewhere in between the bickering of both of the adults, Dazai ended up falling asleep, slumped against the raven. Crying seemed to completely wear him out\u00a0\n\"He's adorable, right?\"\u00a0\nAkutagawa hummed in response, fondly looking at the kid.\n\"How did... you handled him so well\"\u00a0\nAkutagawa rolled his eyes \"I've taken care of Gin for a very long time, and you know, Im not an idiot. Also, I've watched Chuuya handle Dazai more times than I can count\"\n\"Yeah... right... right\" Atsushi mumbled, turning his attention towards his drink\n\"Is he going to be okay?\"\n\"Yes... yes of course. He's improved a lot in just a week\"\n\"I must assume it must have been pretty bad. During his time at the mafia I never saw him...break down, but with how protective Chuuya was of him... it made me realise that it must have happened quite a lot behind closed doors\"\n\"Um... yeah... It got pretty bad. He thought he was going to get punished for breathing\" Atsushi grimaced\u00a0\nOnce it got dark outside, the weretiger concluded that it was a good time to wake up the kid and leave.\u00a0\n\"Dazai, we've gotta go. It's getting late\" He gently spoke\nThe kid stirred a little but didn't seem to make an effort to move. He seemed to have different plans than Atsushi's\u00a0\n\"Dazai?\" He tried again\n\"Don't wanna. Aku is warm.... And comfy\" The kid whined as he snuggled closer to the raven\nAkutagawa felt his face heat up and diverted his gaze from his rival, who was fondly smiling at him\n\"Kunikida has dinner at home\"\u00a0\nHe whined a little more \"But Aku is cuddly\"\nIt was official, Akutagawa's face was on actual fire and there was nowhere he could hide because the kid was making it difficult to move\nAtsushi chuckled as he scratched his neck\n\"He seems to really like you. Um... I'll phone Kunikida and tell him we're running late\"\nThe raven cleared his throat \"Dazai? You have to leave now. We don't want to make Kunikida wait, right?\"\nThat seemed to do the trick as the kid sat up a bit\n\"But-\"\n\"-No buts. Come on, up you go\"\nDazai groaned and then rubbed his eyes. He reincorporated himself and extended his arms and made a grabby motion towards the weretiger\n\"Sushi?\" He mumbled drowsily\nAtsushi's heart melted\n\"Im here, Dazai\"\u00a0\nHe picked Dazai into his arms who went completely slump against him, head resting against his shoulder\n\"Say goodbye to Akutagawa\" Atsushi said\n\"Goodnight Aku, Im sorry\" He murmured\nAkutagawa found himself chuckling, he was still as strong-minded as his adult self \"Goodnight, Dazai\"\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\n\"You like him\" Dazai confirmed after they had left the cafe\n\"Haaah?! Um, I mean... I- I- he's a great opponent um I... Fun!\"\nDazai giggled in his arms but didn't seem to say anything else.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n***\n\n\nWhen they got home, Atsushi explained what had happened with Akutagawa to the blond because even though the kid seemed fine at this moment he knew the conversation he had had was probably taking a toll on him.\n\"Would you like to watch a movie before bed?\" Kunikida suggested, aware that it was the best option to keep the kid from overthinking\nThe kid nodded and sat down on the couch but he didn't look entirely satisfied.\n\"Whatever it is that is eating you alive, you can trust me. Im not going to get mad at you\"\n\"Can you hold me? Please?\" He asked in the faintest whisper\nKunikida's chest filled with warmth\n\"Of course buddy, come here\" He said as he sat on the sofa next to him\nDazai was wrapped himself in his blanket and sat on Kunikida's lap with his head against his chest, slowly sinking into the embrace.\n\"I've got a good idea of a movie we can watch\" The blond hummed\n\"Which one?\"\n\"Ponyo. I think you'll love it\"\nDazai simply nodded as he snuggled closer to Kunikida, amazed by how such a simple touch was having this big of an effect on him.\n\"No.... no one ever hugged me back then. Not even when I was upset and the only thing I wanted was.... was \" He couldn't bring himself to finish the phrase\nKunikida brought a hand up to his head and started to comb through Dazai's hair, careful not to pull too hard on any knots.\n\"Im so sorry Dazai. Now you can have all the hugs in the world, okay?\" Kunikida promised, rubbing his back\n\"M'kay\" He mumbled nuzzling into the older man\nNot even half way through the movie the kind was sound asleep on the blonds arms, with a gentle smile on his face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFRIDAY\n\n\n\n\nToday, the agency had decided to go out for lunch and have a nice picnic in one of the many parks of Yokohama. All of them wanted to make Dazai's last day as a child as enjoyable as possible so after learning that he had never had a picnic, it seemed like the best option. Everyone had brought a variety of food and a bunch of activities for the kid to do and keep him entertained.\nKenji, Kyoka, and Dazai were sat together in the same blanket while the blond taught them how to make flower crowns. Even though Kenji was a pretty good teacher the two kids were struggling a bit; every time they made a braid the stem would snap, making them have to start all over again. However they didn't look frustrated or upset, Kyoka and Dazai were just glad they could relax and be kids.\nOnce the brunet finally got the hang of it (at least to some extent) he skipped towards where the white-haired boy was sitting, who was quietly reading a book, leaning on a tree.\n\"Atsushi! Which flowers do you prefer?\" Dazai asked as he kneeled down in front of him, showing him four different kinds of flowers\nHe scanned all the different options and then spoke\n\"The pink ones. Are you going to make me a flower crown?\" He looked up at the kid who nodded with a smile beaming on his face\n\nAtsushi loved this kid \n\n\"Atsushi?\"\n\"Yes, Dazai?\"\n\"Can I sit with you?\" He asked, fidgeting with the hem of his shirt\n\"Sure\" He extended his arms and Dazai happily sat between the weretigers legs, leaning against his chest as he started working again on his gift.\n\"Comfy?\"\nDazai happily nodded\nThe kid gradually melted into the embrace. One of the most significant improvements that Atsushi had noticed is that he would ask for hugs all the time or anything that had to do with physical contact. It had become a common thing in the office for Dazai to just spend his afternoons napping in someone's arms and no one, no one had a single complaint.\n\"Hey Dazai? If you could go anywhere in the world, for free, where would you go?\" Asked the weretiger, his hand had started to comb through the brown locks avoiding any tugs.\n\"Mmmm...I would go see the northern lights\" He answered, braiding the pink flowers\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yeah, I love the stars. I think they're the prettiest thing ever\"\nThe hand in his hair was making him a little sleepy, but the kid didn't want him to stop. So he stayed quiet\n\"And you?\"\n\"Maybe swim in the Caribbean or something like that\"\n\"Oh! That would be cool! Do you like sharks?\"\n\"Umm... Im... they're okay\" He chuckled nervously \"but I would like to avoid swimming with them\"\nDazai hummed in acknowledgment \"They are a lot safer than how the movies portray them\"\n\"Oh? Still, I won't be the one to prove that point\" Atsushi confessed, making the kid giggle\n\"Would you like me to braid your hair?\" He asked, raking his fingers through Dazais hair\nThe kid froze, turned around, and looked at Atsushi with his eyes filled with hope \"You can braid?\"\n\"Yep\"\n\"Then yes please!\" He turned back around so Atsushi could start working on his hair.\n\"You're so awesome\" Dazai whispered and the weretiger felt his mouth tug into a smile\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter eating lunch with the agency, Dazai had finished Atsushi's pink flower crown, which he had proudly handed over.\nNow, he was walking around the park searching for a very specific type of blue flower for Kunikida's crown. It was an especially complicated task as he was looking for flowers that had already been broken off and ones that had the stem alright.\nOnce he had a bunch full of them he swiftly turned around and was going to go back to the agency when something bumped into his back. The impact made him stumble to the ground and when he turned around he realised that most of his flowers were being crushed by a pair of shoes. His eyes traveled all the way up and saw a man. A scowl ran through his face as he scanned the kid on the ground. But what made Dazai start to panic was the smell the man gave off. It was a sickening mixture of sweat, whiskey, and tobacco.\n\"Damn children, they should teach you some fucking respect to elders\" He grunted and the kid rapidly got up on his feet as he distanced himself.\nDazai's body unconsciously trembled in fear, he didn't like that tone of voice, he knew bad things happened when someone spoke to him like that. He wanted to call out to the agency but his throat had completely closed up, so no noise was coming out of him\nThe man cocked an eyebrow at the lack of response \"Where did your manners go? When you bump into someone, you say sorry, got it?\" He fumed\nDazai wanted to say something. Anything really. Either sorry or the fact that it had been the man's fault. Whatever it took so that he could get away from this man.\nBut he couldn't\n\"What is it, brat? Cat caught your tongue?\" He teased, noticing tears were starting to well up in the corner of the kid eyes\n\"I-I-I am sor-sorry\" He managed to say.\n\nMaybe it wasn't too late.\n\n\nMaybe he could get away\n\n\"Where are your parents? Maybe they should teach you a damn lesson about-\" The man was cut off when a pair of strong arms had shoved him away from Dazai\n\"I swear if you lay a single finger on the kid, I'll torture you so bad you won't be able to recognise yourself\" Yosano spat as she placed herself in between the kid and the man\n\"What? Of course, you women go all soft on kids. Its called discipline, damn it\" The man hissed, giving her a lopsided grin\n\nDiscipline\n\nThat single word had sent Dazai a full-body shiver.\n\"It's called abuse. You piece of shit\" Yosano spat back\nAnd suddenly someone was behind him, Dazai turned around to find Ranpo looking at him, with a kid smile on his face and his arms extended, Without thinking it twice the kid jumped into his arms and hid his face in the crook of the ravens neck, finally relaxing a little.\n\"You should still teach the damn thing to watch where it's going\" The man snapped back\n\"First of all, he's not a thing. Second of all, thats not what happened\" Ranpo bitterly corrected\n\"He bumped into me, boy\"\n\"I don't think that's the case. I believe that because you're intoxicated, and an asshole, you didn't see him and you bumped into him and stepped all over his flowers\"\nHis face twisted in anger \"What type of bullshit is that?\"\n\"That bullshit is the truth\" And with that, he Ranpo left with the kid in his arms \"Yosano? Deal with him\"\nRanpo walked back to where the main area of their picnic was located in and while doing so they crossed paths with all of the members of the agency, who were running in the mans direction. Dazai whipped his head back in surprise to look how everyone had ganged up on the man.\n\"We really care about you, mini Dazai\"\nAnd with that said, the brunet wrapped again his arms around Ranpo and he finally let the tears fall, feeling the man rub his back.\nRanpo hated when people told him to stop crying.\nHe despised it.\nSometimes thoughts and feelings were too overwhelming and the only thing that helped was crying so he figured that's what the kid needed to do. He needed to let it all out.\n\"We've got you, Dazai. You can let go, you can cry\" Ranpo said and the kid cried even harder.\nRanpo carefully sat down and leaned against a tree. He tenderly rocked the kid in his arms, rubbing soothing circles in his back to release all the tension in his tiny body.\nOnce no more tears fell from his face, Kunikida had approached them and given the kid his knitted jumper, hoping it would comfort him and keep him from shaking so much.\n\"You know, the agency had to stop Kenji from destroying him and he didn't even have his ability\" Ranpo whispered and he felt the kid laugh against him\nThats a good sign\n\"He was so scary... and mean\" He hiccuped \"Just like them\"\nThe detective frowned \"Im sorry, we should have taken better care of you\"\n\"It's not your fault. A normal kid wouldn't have these problems\" Dazai muttered, full of shame\n\"You're wrong. First of all, I don't think anyone at the agency is normal, and that's not bad, is it?\"\n\"I- no.... no but...\"\n\"Second of all, don't compare your fears with others. Just because someone doesn't find a certain thing scary, doesn't mean it isn't\"\n\"Okay\" He whispered and snuggled again against him, closing his eyes and finally letting himself fully relax.\nTen minutes later Ranpo spoke again.\n\"Mini Dazai, Im going to fall asleep if we don't move\"\nHe whined a little and Ranpo chuckled. He was as stubborn as his older self\n\"You'll have to carry me home then\"\n\"Okay. I'll do it\" Dazai said and Ranpo gave up. He closed his eyes and allowed himself to fall asleep, resting his head on top of Dazai's\nYosano, who had been watching the whole thing, approached the pair and crouched down in front of the kid, who was completely awake.\n\"He really did fall asleep\" He whispered\nYosano chuckled \"Do you need help to get out?\"\n\"Yes please\" He smiled sheepishly at her. Ranpo sleeping against him was a tiny bit uncomfortable and he still had to finish making flower crowns for the rest of the team.\nYosano detangled Ranpo from the kid and moved him so he rested against her, his head in the crook of her neck.\nWhen Yosano heard the detective whine a little she rubbed his back and just as she had been told, whenever she touched, she did it firmly. No soft touches were allowed, Ranpo despised that.\n\"Shh... I've got you Ranpo. Sleep hon\"\n\"I'll make you both a flower crown\" Said the kid as he stood up\nOnce Dazai was finally free he thanked Yosano and made his way towards Kyouka, Kenji, and Atsushi. Even though he was still a little shaken up, Dazai didn't want that mean man to ruin his day so he wanted to continue and play with his friends as much as possible.\nThey were currently painting some rocks Kenji had found at the lake. When Dazai sat down he was greeted with hugs and warm smiles and they handed him a bunch of paintbrushes and paints so he could start the new activity.\nBack with the detective and the doctor, Ranpo was almost asleep again when his partner decided to break the silence\n\"I know someone who would also like a flower crown\" Yosano teased\n'Shut it' The raven signed\n\"Mmmm... I'll ask Kenji to teach you how to make them. What's Poe's favourite colour?\"\n'Yellow'\n\"Yellow flowers, noted\"\n'Good. Now sleep'\nYosano smiled at her friend and nodded, feeling Ranpo melt against her. She rubbed his back as she kept an eye on the children. She didn't want to deal with another asshole today, but everything seemed to have calmed down as she watched them paint.\nAn hour later, as Dazai and Atsushi were discussing whether to paint their rocks blue or purple when something caught the kids' attention. He stopped mid-sentence and stood up, eyes fixated in one spot\nThe weretiger, a little worried, stopped what he was doing and looked around for any immediate threat \"Hah? What's wrong Dazai?\"\n\"Sushi! Sushi! Look! Its Aku! We should go say hello!\" He pointed towards someone who was wearing all black\n\nAkutagawa\n\n\nOh, shit\n\n\"Dazai um I don't think-\" but the kid was already running towards him\n\"Akuuu!\" Yelled Dazai as he approached him\nAkutagawa had the exact time to turn around, catch the boy in his arms and avoid falling to the ground.\n\"Hi\" Dazai giggled as he hugged the boy closer\n\"Hello, Dazai. What are you doing here all alone?\" He asked, clearly concerned\nJust as the kid was about to answer, the weretiger appeared, having finally caught up with them\n\"I\" Atsushi was panting \"I forgot Dazai... could run\" He wheezed \"He'd never done it before\"\nWhen the raven looked back at the kid he only gave him a sheepish smile\n\"You know, we made flower crowns! Atsushi could teach you how to make them! You guys could make them together\" He chimed\nAkutagawa felt the heat rise to his cheeks, but that was the least of his problems because he had noticed that the brunet had dried tear streaks all over his face.\n\"Dazai, are you okay? Did someone hurt you?\"\nDazais eyes widened in surprise\"No! Um... I... there was a scary man that made me upset but the agency protected me\"\n\"He didn't- did he touch you?\" He glared at the weretiger \"Jinko what-\"\n\"No, no, no! He, um, he only said mean things... It's a bit lame but um...\" He adverted his gaze and he fidgeted with a piece of Akutagawa's coat\n\"It's not lame, Dazai. I wouldn't have liked it either if that man would have said mean things to me\" He explained\n\"Really? But you look so brave! Scary men should fear you, not the other way round!\"\nAkutagawa chuckled \"Well Im glad you think so, but I guess everyone just has their own fears, right?\"\n\"I guess so.\"Dazai shrugged in his arms \"Are you going to stay with me and Sushi? We're painting rocks!\" He beamed\n\"Um... as inviting as that sounds, I have to get going. But you have fun with Atsushi, alright?\" Akutagawa placed the kid on the floor and ruffled his hair gently\n\"Okay! You know, Sushi turns super red every time you call him by his first name\" Dazai smiled innocently, noticing how the two rivals face flushed in embarrassment and realisation.\n\"WELL! Time to go! Bye Akutagawa! Love yo- I MEAN SEE YOU- SEE YOU\" Atsushi cried out completely mortified, taking Dazai's hand and finally leaving the scene.\nAkutagawa was left alone, blushing and with butterflies all over his stomach.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the picnic, Kunikida planned to meet up with Chuuya Nakahara so he could finally encounter the small version of his (ex)partner. He had kept the redhead updated since the first day of Dazai turning into a kid, but because he had been overseas for a mission so he couldn't have come earlier.\nActually, Chuuya was supposed to stay for a few more days, but he knew that the ability would wear out on Sunday so he had left everything and returned to Yokohama because there wasn't anything that he wanted more in his life than to see his partner be shorter than him.\nDazai nervously swayed back and forth on his feet as he waited with Kunikida for Chuuya to arrive. He had deliberately picked out his favourite knitted jumper (Obviously the purple one with the little penguin) hoping Chuuya would like it. Although the jumper was the least of his troubles.\n\nWould Chuuya like him?\n\n\nWould Chuuya be nice to him?\n\n\nWould he maybe want a hug?\n\n\nWhat would-\n\n\"Dazai, stop freaking yourself out\" Kunikida brought him out of his thoughts.\n\"Right. Okay. Got it. Relax\" He told himself and the blond chuckled\n\"He's going to love you, kid. There is no reason for you to worry\" He reassured him, a hand gently ruffling his hair\nThe kid nodded and hugged Kaiyo a little tighter. He was very grateful for his friend, it comforted him so much.\nSuddenly the sound of a motorcycle made Dazai whip his head and saw how someone was getting off of it. The thing that stood out the most for the kid is that he had a long black coat and a black hat with a red band that had a thin silver chain that hung over the brim coloured lining.\n\"Is that him?\" Dazai asked but he already knew what the answer was going to be\n\"Yes\"\n\nHe's so cool\n\n\"Damn, you really weren't kidding, were you?\" Chuuya laughed as he made his way towards them\n\"You're... Chuuya\" Dazai's eyes glowed\n\"The one and only. How are you tiny Dazai?\" He chuckled to himself \"I can't believe I get to call you small\"\n\"Why is that?\" He tilted his head to the side curiously\n\"Big Dazai is a lot taller than me\"\n\"What! Really? Like a lot taller?\"\n\"I mean not thaaaaaaat much, just like 20cm taller\" Chuuya scoffed\nDazai turned around to look at the blond \"Woah! Im almost as tall as Kunikida!\"\nThe blond chuckled and shook his head on \"Not entirely\"\n\"And who do we have here?\" Chuuya asked gesturing the plushie\nDazai felt his cheek redden and he nervously squirmed\n\nWould Chuuya think it was lame to have a plushie?\n\n\"U-um his name is Kaiyo. He's very soft\" He affirmed, tightening his hold on the penguin\nThe redhead chuckled \"I figured. Big Dazai also has a plushie (a bunch, actually). It's a purple panda and she's as soft as the clouds. I gave it to him for his birthday\"\n\"Really? Whats her name?\"\n\"Kotaro\"\nDazais smile widened \"I like it\"\n\"I figured\" Chuuya smiled back at the kid\nChuuya had told Kunikida over the telephone that he already had the whole thing planned, so he let the redhead take the lead as they started to walk through the streets of Yokohama.\nThe redhead was feeling quite relieved now that he had met the kid. One of his main worries was that the agency wouldn't be able to take care of him, but Dazai seemed happy, relaxed, he looked like a kid. From what his boyfriend has told him, those weren't common things during his childhood, so seeing him like this was a good sign.\n\"I saw a movie with Kunikida yesterday, you kinda look like one of the characters\" Dazai chimed, and Chuuya felt his heart melt a little when the kid begun to skip\n\"Really? Which one?\"\n\"Ponyo\" He stated and the blond was expecting Chuuya to be offended, maybe to insult someone, but what he wasn't expecting was to sweetly smile at him and agree\n\"We do look alike. Did you enjoy the movie?\"\n\nWhat- was this Chuuya? \n\n\nThe same Chuuya that had anger issue and would explode anytime Dazai commented on his height?\n\n\"Yes! Although I fell asleep because I was tired but it-it was super cool!\"\n\"I've seen the movie too. Who's your favorite character\"\nDazai's cheeks flushes \"Um...Po-ponyo\"\nChuuya hummed \"I really liked the old lady, I thought she was hilarious\"\nThe kid's eyes lit up \"Yeah! She thought there was a tsunami when really it had only been a tiny splash\"\nAs they were walking, Chuuya turned around, looked at his pocket watch, and stated:\n\"Cover you ears, kid\"\nAnd without second thought Dazai pressed his hands on top of his ears. He was about to ask why when he was cut off by a train horn, which made him flinch back but because of his hands, it managed to muffle out most of the sound. He then watched the train go by in awe and looked back at Chuuya.\n\"Loud noises are a little scary, right?\" The redhead gave him a lopsided grin\nHe nodded\n\"Thank you Chuuya\" The kid perked\n\nHow did... But Chuuya had just met the kid?\n\nThe redhead chuckled as he sensed Kunikida's confused state\n\"No matter what Dazai it is, big or small, he mostly suffers from the same trauma and triggers. I've known how to help him for almost half of my life\"\nAnd damn did he help.\n It's like Chuuya had a manual with everything that could possibly scare Dazai and avoided it with such ease that it made Kunikida wonder if this was his actual ability.\nEven now, when Yokohama was at its busiest, with people bumping into each other, cars honking, and different smells everywhere, he managed to keep Dazai in a completely calm state.\n\"We have a bit of walking to do, do you want me to carry you?\" He said kneeling in front of the kid\n\"Yes please\" He quickly answered, because he wanted a hug from Chuuya so badly\nThe redhead gently brought Dazai into his arms and picked him up from the floor. The kid completely melted into the embrace as he wrapped himself around Chuuya. He let out a little content sigh and without a second thought he started playing with the red locks that had him captivated since they had first met.\nKunikida was amazed at how at peace Dazai looked. When he actually thought about it, it made sense. Sometimes while they were working at the agency and Dazai would have a bad day, he would always receive a call from his ex-partner. No one knew what the calls were about, but what they knew is that as soon as Dazai heard Chuuya's voice, a real genuine smile started to form on his face. The brunet spent most of the calls on the couch and in complete silence and the agency could see how the tension would leave his body, so much that he would usually fall asleep at the end of his calls.\nSo all the agency was well aware that Dazai's weak spot, was Chuuya Nakahara.\n\"Alright, here we are\" Said the redhead who pulled Kunikida out of his thoughts.\n\"Okay, well I'll leave you two. If you need me I'll be in the cafe a few streets\" He excused himself, well aware that Chuuya didn't trust him and was probably more comfortable if he wasn't here.\n\"Bye!\" Dazai waved at Kunikida\nChuuya then proceeded to sit down on a bench maneuvering the kid into his lap so that he could look at the river.\n\"Big Dazai loves to see the sunset in this exact spot. We always watch it together\"\nThe kid leaned into Chuuya's chest and snuggled closer to him\n\"When I was back at my old um... place, even though I used to always hurt, sunsets made it a little better. They're always so pretty\" He whispered\n\nDon't cry Chuuya\n\n\nDon't you dare cry\n\n\"I know, that's why I brought you here\" Chuuya said as softly stroked the brown locks\n\"Oh, right...I seem to forget big Dazai has told you most of these things. Do... do you know everything?\"\n\"As much as he remembered\" Chuuya's voice was uncharacteristically gentle\n\"Did we tell you on our own?\" His voice was so small it made Chuuya's heart clench\n\"Of course, I would never force Dazai to open up or do something that makes him uncomfortable.\" The kid relaxed into the embrace and Chuuya stroked his hair as he continued to speak \"The thing is, It used to get very scary for big Dazai because he had to deal with bad memories and feelings alone so, after building a lot of trust and me just being a decent friend, he let me help him\"\n\"Thats good... right?\"\n\"Yes. Scary things are not as scary when you've got someone\"\nDazai hummed in agreement \n\"Im glad we have someone\"\nThe redhead chuckled\n\"Not just someone, kid. You've got a whole family\"\n\"That sounds nice\"\n\"It is nice\" Chuuya clarified\nThey sat in silence as they watched the sunset. Dazai snuggled closer (if that was even possible) to Chuuya as he played with Kaiyo. The redhead protectively wrapped his arms around him as he looked at Dazai with fondness. Chuuya's heart ached for the little boy. After all he had gone through he still looked so... gentle, loving.... innocent. He couldn't imagine what type of monster would inflict so much pain to a child.\nOnce darkness engulfed the streets of Yokohama, Chuuya placed Dazai on the ground and stood up\n\"Come on gremlin, time to go. It's getting late\" Chuuya extended his hand but Dazai seemed to have other plans\n\"But I wanna keep playing\" The kid protested\n\"Hmm, I don't think so, Kaiyo is getting sleepy\" He grabbed the penguin from him\nDazai frowned at him\n\"No he isn't\"\n\"Yes he is. Listen, he's yawning\" Chuuya said as he yawned, hiding his mouth so it would look like it was the penguin\n\"That was you!\" Dazai accused, an amused looked starting to appear on his face\n\"What? Of course not! Listen, he has something to say\"\nChuuya hid his mouth as he made the penguin say \"Im sleepy Dazai \" With a horrible pitchy voice\nThe kid laughed openly \"He doesn't sound like that!\"\nChuuya grinned playfully\n\"Is this better, Dazai ?\" He made the penguin say with a raspy low voice\nThe kid was laughing again, with the biggest smile Chuuya had yet seen \"No! That's so much worse!\"\n\"Yeah? Well, because you're not listing to poor Kaiyo, who is clearly exhausted, Im gonna have to drag you myself to Kunikida's car\"\nAnd with that said, he waited for Dazai's approval (he wasn't going to grab the kid all of a sudden without permission, he knew better than that), which was a little smile, and as soon as he did, Chuuya threw the kid over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes and started walking\n\"Hahahhahha! Chuuya I can walk!\" Dazai's little body was shaking from the laughter\n\"Is that so, tiny punk? It didn't seem like you could three seconds ago\"\n\"Chuuya my brain is gonna explode!\" Dazai whined\n\"No it isn't\"\n\"Yes it is\"\n\"No\"\n\"Yes\"\n\"No\"\n\"Yes\"\n\"Yes\"\nDazai giggled \"Chuuya, just because I'm seven doesn't mean that Im falling for that\"\nThe redhead shrugged \"It was worth a shot\" he said as he maneuvered the kid so he sat on his hip as they walked\nDazai seemed to finally give in as he wrapped his arms around Chuuya's neck rested his head on his shoulder, closing his eyes because he was in fact a little sleepy.\n\"Chuuya is very silly\" His hands played with the red locks to soothe himself, hugging him closer\nOnce they met up with Kunikida, Chuuya tried to place Dazai on the floor but he wouldn't let go.\n\"Dazai, sweetheart, I have to go\" Chuuya spoke and the kid shook his head, tightening his grip\n\"Um...I have a few cases to work on, would you like to come up to my apartment and keep Dazai company for a while?\"\nChuuya was a little unsure, but when Dazai pulled away and looked at him with puppy eyes he felt his head nodding.\n\"Yay!\" Dazai smiled and hugged Chuuya again.\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in Kunikida's apartment the three of them had had a peaceful dinner together and now Dazai was running around his room while enthusiastically showing every single toy to the redhead.\n\nHe actually looked like a kid. \n\n\"-And this is Neko! Him and Kaiyo are very good friends\" The kid placed an elephant plushie in Chuuya's hand\n\"I bet Neko is pretty cool\"\n\"He is! He can play the piano and he knows how to speak Spanish!\"\n\"Does he now?\"\nDazai nodded, \"You can play with him if you want, I think he likes you\"\nDazai set off running again and Chuuya had seen it coming from miles away. Just as the kid turned to show another toy to him, his foot got tangled with the blanket that was on the floor making him fall to the floor with an 'oof'\nChuuya stiffed a laugh, Dazai had always been extremely clumsy.\n\"Do you want me to beat up the blanket for you?\"\nDazai rolled his eyes and poked his tongue out at him \"Don't act so concerned, you wanted to laugh\"\n\"No of course not!\" But the crack in his voice said otherwise\n\"It's okay\" Dazai sat up and wiped his hands \"Im a bit clumsy. Doctors say I'll grow out of it\"\nNot... entirely, Chuuya thought\n\"Now, all jokes aside. I would never laugh if you were actually hurt, okay?\"\nThat made the kid smile \"I know. Chu is not like them\"\n\"So you don't want me to beat up the blanket?\"\nDazai giggled as he shook his head \"No! The poor blanket didn't do anything. Oh! And this is a drawing I made, it's one of the moons that Neptune has, it Triton. I think its the coolest one because it pours out nitrogen ice! I've only read about it once but I thought it would be very pretty to look at, right?\"\nChuuya was looking at Dazai with immense fondness. When they were partners one of the things that had always amazed the redhead was how fucking smart Dazai was. But what he liked the most was sometimes Dazai would unconsciously rant about stuff and Chuuya found it adorable. Especially when the brunet would realise he had been ranting and would fucking blush.\n\"That's amazing, kid. You sure know a lot\"\n\"Some... some people don't like my facts. They say I- they're a waste of time\" He confessed, his face dropping a little\n\"Don't believe that, those people are assholes\"\u00a0\n Dazai's eyes widened. He clasped his hands over his mouth as he let out a laugh\n\"Chuuya said a bad word!\" He gasped\n\"They deserve it. Plus, I know you're not gonna repeat it, right?\"\nDazai grinned slyly as he turned around to search for more toys and Chuuya recognised that look immediately.\n\nOh no\n\n\nHe was plotting something \n\n\nHe was going to-\n\n\"Of course not, Whoever says that word would be an asshole\"\nIt cracked a huge smile in his partner, Dazai seemed like an actual kid.\n\"You're not gonna tell Kunikida I thought you that word, right?\"\n\"Chuuya is silly. I already knew it\" He confessed, stiffing a yawn\nThe mafioso raised his eyebrows and looked at his watch \"Are you tired?\nDazai had been feeling quite sleepy for a while, but with Chuuya here with him he didn't want to miss a second of it.\nDazai shook his head \"Can we play a little more?\"\n\"Sure thing, kid\"\nThe brunet then stood up and walked all the way to where his partner was sitting and plopped down next to him.\u00a0\n\"Chuuya?\"\nThe redhead turned a little to properly look at the kid beside him\"Yes?\"\n\"What's your ability?\" He asked, eyes sparkling with curiosity\n\"Gravity manipulation\"\nDazai gasped as his whole face lit up\n\"Does that you can make me fly?\" The brunet exclaimed\nChuuya repressed a flinched \"Unfortunately it doesn't. No ability works on you\"\nThe redhead watched as the kids expression dulled and he hugged Kaiyo a little closer\n\"Oh. Its-... yeah sorry, I forgot\" His eyes moved down to the ground\nThe redhead cleared his throat, making Dazai focus his attention on him again\"But do you wanna know something cool?\"\nThe kid nodded\n\"I've got one secret ability. One that I cant use if you aren't around\" He whispered\nDazai tilted his head in confession \"Really? Why?\"\n\"Because I can't turn it off. It's extremely powerful and violent and you're the only one that can stop me\" and as soon as Chuuya said that, awe transformed into the kids face\n\"I can stop you?\" He asked incredulously\u00a0\n\"Yes\"\u00a0\n\"But you said it's super powerful!\"\nChuuya softly smiled at him \"You are too. Look, let's try the gravity manipulation so you can see how cool you are\"\nThe redhead grabbed the elephant from his side and showed it to the brunet\n\"Now, im gonna make Neko fly, and when he reaches the bed you have to touch my hand so it can land. Only if you want to, of course\" He explained and Dazai nodded\nChuuya took off his left glove and touched the elephant. Soon the plushie was surrounded by a red light and it was sent flying around the room.\nJust when it levitated over the bed, Dazai wrapped his hand around Chuuyas wrist and No Longer Human activated, making the plushie fall onto the bed with a bounce.\u00a0\nDazai giggled, with a huge smile plastered on his face as he examined his own hands\n\"Cool, right?\" Chuuya grinned\nThe brunets response was cut off by another yawn. And the mafioso understood that that was the cue to put the kid to bed.\n\"Now, teeny, tiny, minuscule person\" Chuuya said, standing back on his feet \"It's getting really late, so, as I've been told, why don't you get your pj's on while I prepare a glass of milk and honey?\"\nDazai copied his actions and stood up \"M'kay. And then we'll read a story?\"\nChuuya nodded at him and made his way to the kitchen where he prepared the warm beverage. Once he was done he made his way back to the kids room where he found Dazai, with his starry blue pyjamas, already sitting on the bed patiently waiting for him and Chuuya's heart melted.\u00a0\nWhen he handed the cup, Dazai drank it quietly, looking at Chuuya as he moved a chair next to his bed so he could read the bedtime story, which right now was: The Lion, The witch and the wardrobe\nWhen he was done the redhead took the cup from him and put it on the nightstand. He turned off the main light so the only thing on was a little nightlight which made it visible enough to read.\n\"Come on, in you go\" Chuuya opened the covers for him, but Dazai didn't budge\n\"Chu?\"\u00a0\n\"Yes?\"\n\"I...\" He fiddled with his fingers \"Can you... can you h-hold me until I fall asleep? Please?\"\nJust when Chuuya thought he couldn't get any cuter.\nThe redhead nodded. He sat down on the kids' bed and opened his arms at him. The brunet quickly accepted his invitation and snuggled on his lap, resting his face on Chuuya's chest.\n\"Chu?\" He asked as the redhead grabbed the book\n\"Yes, kid?\"\n\"Thank you for everything. You made me very happy and I can tell you make big Dazai very happy too\"\n\nThe little bastard really knows all of my weak spots\n\nChuuya thought as he put the book down again and brought him into a hug.\n\"You're such a sweet boy, Dazai. You're too precious\" He mumbled into the kid's hair\n\nHes's making me go so damn soft\n\nThe kid giggled in his arms\n\nFuck it, he deserves it\n\nChuuya pulled away just enough so he could look at the brunet \"Remember one thing for me: No matter what happens, we'll always love you Dazai, we'll always be there for you. And you're extremely brave\"\n\"How brave?\"\n\"The bravest I've ever met. Even braver than me\"\n\"Really?\" He asked disbelievingly\u00a0\n\"I wouldn't lie to you\"\n\"Mmmm...Chu?\" He said, resting again against the redhead's chest.\nChuuya was really starting to recognise his partner, but he wasn't about to come here and complain. This kid deserved all of Chuuya's patience.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"How is big Dazai?\"\n\"Very tall\"\nThe brunet giggled, but Chuuya could sense that was not what he had wanted to ask. So he stayed quiet.\n\"I meant um.... is big Dazai okay?\"\nChuuya's lack of answer made the kid continue\n\"I- I know trauma doesn't go away overnight and I... don't think mine ever will so- so Im not sure how I'm holding up\" Dazai muttered, running his hands through Kaiyo soft fabric\nChuuya took a deep breath. He was a little unsure on how to say it without worrying the kid even more.\n\"He's made so much progress and an insane amount of internal healing. However, as you said, trauma doesn't disappear overnight so some days are pretty hard. But the good thing is that you don't have to go through anything alone. Im never going to leave your side, Dazai. \"\n\"Even if it gets super bad?\" Dazai asked, looking up at Chuuya with glossy eyes\nThe redhead smiled down at him and gently cupped his cheek, rubbing soothing circles on it as he felt the kid lean into the touch.\n\"Even if it gets super bad\"\n\"Pinkie promise?\"\nChuuya chuckled\n\"Pinkie promise\"\nIt seemed to satisfy him because he laid back down and hugged Chuuya again.\n\"Could you... could you tell me stories you have with him? Good ones?\"\n\"Of course, Ive got plenty of good ones\"\nInstead of reading to him. Chuuya spent more than an hour telling the kid stories he had with his partner. Dazai, being as stubborn as he is, had stayed wide awake all the time, but right now Even Chuuya was starting to feel the tiredness course through his body.\n\"Close your eyes, kid\" He muttered with his eyes closed, gently rocking him\n\"But then I'll fall asleep and Chuuya will go\" The child whined\n\"No Dazai. Remember the promise we just made? Im gonna stick with you through everything\"\nDazai huffed \"I know, I meant now. I don't want you to leave. Im happy with Chu\"\nAnd suddenly Chuuya heard little sniffles coming from the brunet, so he opened his eyes again and was met with Dazai holding back the tears.\u00a0\nChuuya quickly forgot about his tiredness \"Hey, Dazai? What's wrong?\" He spoke worriedly\n\"I don't want Chuuya to leave me\" The kid whimpered\nThe redhead felt his heart pang \"Oh, sweetheart\"\nChuuya had dealt with Dazai's abandonment issues a while ago, it wasn't easy but they had gotten around it (kinda). Having to deal with them now, was something that the redhead hadn't thought about. Especially because Chuuya thought he couldn't get attached as they had just met a couple of hours ago, but he was wrong.\n\"You'll leave forever! Nice people always do, and then I get hurt! I don't wanna get hurt!\" He cried in distress, burying his face against Chuuya\n\"Okay, okay. Dazai? Breath Dazai, you're gonna make yourself sick\" Chuuya spoke with a gentle voice\nWith one hand he rubbed circles in his back and with the other, he did something that would immediately calm down big Dazai. He tangled his hand in the kid's hair, a little above the nape, and gently scratched his scalp.\u00a0\nIt really did the trick, because he felt the kid completely melt against him with a little sigh, his sobs turning into hiccups.\n\"Dazai, Im never going to leave you. I know it sounds scary right now but you have to trust me, alright?\"\nThe kid hiccuped and nodded, clutching Chuuya's shirt.\n\"Good job. I swear Im gonna keep you safe. You won't get hurt anymore\" He whispered to the kid\nAfter more soothing words Dazai's clutch had loosed and now seemed completely relaxed in the embrace.\n\"Now close your eyes, okay? You have to go to sleep so you can grow tall and strong\"\nDazai giggle \"Taller than you\"\nChuuya playfully rolled his eyes at the kid \"Yes yes, taller than me\"\n\"Come on, close your eyes\"\n\"Don't wanna sleep\" He whined\n\"Shhh.... You're so tired...\" He brought a hand up to the kids cheek and gently cradled it and at the contact he closed his eyes\n\"Chuu\" He whined again, but the redhead could tell he wasn't really putting up a fight anymore.\n\"Good job... just relax, sunshine\"\nAnd with that said, Chuuya rocked the kid until he was fast asleep. His heart ached a little when he looked at him. He looked so incredibly young. Way too young to have endured such painful experiences. Way too young to feel as much fear as he had felt.\n\nHe was just a kid\n\nHe had always been just a kid, demon prodigy or not. Everyone but Chuuya (and once, Oda) had seemed to forget that.\nWhen he placed Dazai in his bed the kid stirred a little\n\"Shhh... It's okay sweetheart, you're safe\" He reassured, combing his bangs out of his face\nDazai drowsily nodded, smiled at him and he relaxed again as he grabbed Chuuya's hand into his\n\"Chu... safe\" He mumbled drowsily\nA single tear fell from the redheads face as he looked at the kid\n\"Yes Dazai, Chuuya is gonna keep you safe. No one will hurt you again\"\nDazai yawned as he curled up in his bed \"Chu... keep me....sa..fe\" and just like that he fell back asleep\nThe redhead ended up staying a little more, looking after the kid if he were to wake up, but 10 minutes later Chuuya decided it was pretty late so he quietly stepped out of the room.\nHe walked into the living room where Kunikida was, reading a book.\nAt the sight of Chuuya, he closed it and stood up\n\"Well then, thank you for meeting up with us Chuuya. You certainly made his day\" Said Kunikida\nChuuya smiled politely at him and nodded. He went on to put on his shoes, hat, and coat.\n\"Im still impressed with how good you handled him\" He confessed, making Chuuya snort\n\"Honestly, the only difference between big Dazai and tiny Dazai is that one is taller than me. Behind his cocky smile and numerous jokes lays a frightened little kid who doesn't know what he's worth\"\nEven though Chuuya was smiling, Kunikida could see the sadness that lay behind it.\n\"I'll have that in mind, thank you\"\nChuuya nodded and he stepped out of the house but was stopped by the blond clearing his throat.\nThe redhead raised his eyebrows as he turned around \"What is it?\"\n\"You would have known how to handle him way better\" Kunikida stated\n\"I... Yeah, that's true, but don't discourage yourself. He's happy and healthy and that's the most important part. And also you now know how to properly take care of him when he turns back into an adult\"\n\"I don't think warm milk and bedtime stories are going to help\"\n\"You'd be surprised\" Chuuya snorted \"Dazai wasn't taught how to deal with emotions, only pain, fear, and punishments. Whenever you think he's being childish and obnoxious that's because he is childish when it comes to emotions, he doesn't know any better. You know, half of the time he asks me what he's feeling because even though he's a genius he is incapable of understanding his own emotions.\"\nKunikida nodded curtly at him \"Well, thank you again\"\n\"No worries. Also, tell Dazai you're proud of him, it'll make his day\" And with that said, Chuuya left\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n***\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nSATURDAY\n\n\n\nFor Dazai's last night, Kunikida had planned a movie marathon night. He had bought all of the possible treats a kid would love, popcorn, chocolate, sweets, anything you could think of. They were watching the movies surrounded by the five plushies Kunikida had bought him on the couch.\nDazai was protectively wrapped up in a blanket, snuggled up in Kunikida's lap with his head against his chest. As comfortable as he was, Kunikida knew something was eating the kid inside out, but he had learned that most times it was better if he'd let the kid be and not pressure him into talking when he clearly wasn't ready.\nDazai decided to finally speak 15 minutes into the movie\n\"Kunikida?\"\n\"Yes, buddy?\"\n\"Why- why did they hurt me so much? I only wanted to be good and... and they hurt me... so bad\" He whispered, voice breaking\n\nOh fuck.\n\n\nKunikida\u00a0hadn't planned for this conversation to happen\n\n\"I know, and Im sorry. You never deserved any of those things. The people who hurt you, those were monsters\" He spoke with a soothing tone\n\"But what happens if im big and people hurt me again? I don't... I don't think I could handle it again, Im serious- p-please\" He looked at Kunikida, with obvious fear in his eyes\nThe blond cradled his cheek and rubbed his thumb back and forth \"Shhh...don't work yourself up Dazai. You're safe.\"\nDazai nodded as hugged Kunikida a little harder\n\"It won't happen. We're here to protect you and keep you safe. We're going to make sure nothing ever happens to you, I promise\"\nThat seemed to have done the trick because he felt the kids' death grip loosen up. \n\"Kunikida?\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Can I write something to future Dazai?\"\nThe blond smiled down at him, brushing his bangs out of his face\" I think that's a wonderful idea\"\nHe set up a piece of paper and a black pen on the little table in the living room. He placed it far enough so he would have privacy. The brunet thanked him and spent the second half of the movie focusing on his letter. Once he was done he neatly folded it twice and set it aside.\nHe wrapped himself back in the blanket and stood in front of Kunikida, who understood the cue perfectly and lifted him up and placed him in his lap.\nDazai yawned in his arms, squirming a little until he found the perfect position.\n\"Are you tired?\"\n\"A little, but I don't wanna leave you just yet\" He confessed with a small voice\nIt broke Kunikida's heart a little. He had to remind himself that this kid wasn't actually real in a way. But what hurt him the most was knowing that he had existed. It hurt knowing that fifteen years ago lived this little kid who needed love, hugs, and comfort and no one gave it to him. They did nothing but hurt him and traumatise him and there was nothing the blond could do to change that. But it still pained him.\n\"You're not going to leave me. We're partners, okay?\" He reassured him\n\"I know but... dunno\" Dazai shrugged\n\"It must be very hard for you, but trust me. This is not a goodbye\" His throat had started to close up\nDazai yawned again and closed his eyes \"Thank you for everything, Kunikida\"\n\"It's been a pleasure, buddy. Goodnight Dazai, sleep tight\" He whispered to the kid\nAnd with a smile on his face, he said \"G'night Kunikida, I love you\"\nTears immediately threatened to fall from the blond's face.\u00a0\n\"I love you too, buddy\" He mumbled\nAnd Dazai fell asleep. Feeling warm, loved, and protected.\u00a0\nSomething he thought would never happen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nSATURDAY\n\n\n\nDazai woke up feeling like he had just been shot in the head and to help with his headache, Kunikida had burst into his room and-\nWait...\u00a0\n\nHis ?\n\nAnyways, The room and had spent the last thirty minutes explaining what had happened in the last few days. After he was done they had moved to the kitchen, where as soon as Dazai had sat down he was handed a cup of warm milk and honey.\nHe carefully eyed the drink, grabbing the mug and swaying it around.\n\"Drink up. Your younger self wrote you a letter so when your ready you can go ahead and read it\" He said as he placed a piece of paper in front of him\nDazai nodded as he drank from his mug. His eyes widened, an overwhelming amount of feeling washing over him. None that he could recognise\n\"And this is yours\" Kunikida placed Kaiyo on the kitchen table and turned to work on the dishes\n\"I... what?\"\n\"Kaiyo\"\nDazai only nodded and grabbed the letter from the table. He opened it and began to read:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nHello big Dazai. \n\n\nIm not sure if you will remember this but I just wanted to say it has been the best two weeks of my life. The agency was super nice to us and they bought us lots of things. They didn't hit us or make us sad. You know, touch isn't bad, not all of it.\n\n\nBut I hope you knew that already.\n\n\nKunikida was very patient, gentle, and caring so I hope you let him know that we are very thankful for that. He says he's very proud of us too.\n\n\nAnd give him a mug. We broke one, sorry.\n\n\nGive Ranpo a lot of cherry lollipops and tell him riddles and nap with him.\n\n\nDo crosswords with Atsushi and tell him you are proud of him.\n\n\nTalk about cows with Kenji. We have to do more research.\n\n\nYosano loves flowers. Give her Tsubaki, its her\u00a0favourite.\n\n\nJunichiro and Kyoka like a sushi restaurant next door, eat with them.\n\n\nFukuzawa really seems to really like us. Go and read in his office.\n\n\nGive Akutagawa a hug and tell him you are proud of him (and apologise again)\n\n\nWatch spirited away with your boyfriend, Chuuya.\n\n\nAlso, tell Chuuya he is very pretty, I was too shy to tell him.\n\n\n(Now I know why orange is our favourite colour)\n\n\nAnd he pinkie promised us he's never going to leave you, even if thing get super bad.\n\n\nI know it's probably been very hard but Im very proud of you for making it this far. The good thing is that now you have a family and they've promised me to keep you safe.\n\n\nSo don't be scared, no one will hurt us anymore. \n\n\n(You can ask for hugs, okay?)\n\n\nAnd please take good care of Kaiyo. It's the first plushie we've ever had.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDazai's hands were violently shaking. His younger self sounded so hopeful. It's something he thought would never happen. From the few memories Dazai hasn't blocked from his childhood, they're all horrible. He remembers being antisocial, being terribly afraid of adults, of new people, new things, even the nice ones.\u00a0\nBut the letter... Dazai seemed to have... conquered all of that.\n\"Wha-... did ... did you promise... kid Dazai to keep me safe?\" He asked incredulously\u00a0\n\"Of course. He was terrified it would happen again so I promised him we'd never let anyone hurt you like that again and I mean it\"\n\"Thank you Kunikida... really\" Dazai breathed out\n\"It's okay Dazai, I was looking after my partner\"\n\"Yeah but... I know it sounds stupid and mushy but you gave me the childhood I never had. I... It mustn't have been easy and I bet you saw some ugly things but still, you manage to make me ...happy\"\u00a0\nKunikida smiled at his partner, who looked uncharacteristically vulnerable right now \"Im glad\"\nDazai chuckled dryly as he looked at the blond \"I was a bit of a brat, wasn't I?\"\nKunikida quickly shook his head\"Absolutely not. You were incredibly sweet as a kid, I've never liked kids but you really changed my view upon them\"\nDazais eyes widened in surprise\u00a0\"Hah? Are you sure that was me? Because I was always told as a kid I was a nuisanc- ... Oh\"\nKunikida realised what had happened, as he gave him a sad lopsided smile\n\"You were an angel, Dazai. Polite, kind, responsible, empathetic... don't believe anything you had previously been told\"\nThe brunet nodded, his gaze turning back to the letter \"Oh\"\n\"Um, you know, a little after I turned 8 was the first time I... I tried to kill myself... But I... um, I don't think... I think if kid Dazai were to exist again, he wouldn't have tried if he were with all of you\"\nDazai and his fucking ability to make me cry, Thought Kunikida as he felt tears well up\n\"Im glad I could help. That kid deserved...-you deserved so much more Dazai, please never believe otherwise\"\n\"Thank you\" Dazai said, he grabbed the plus- Kaiyo from the table and ran his finger through the soft fabric\n\nJust like his younger self\n\n\"Do you remember anything?\" Kunikida asked, sitting in front of him\nDazai let out a chuckle and looked back at his partner \"I do... The weird thing is that now that I think of my childhood, it still sucked, obviously, but there seems to be something... positive? I don't know... something warm? Like when I touch Kaiyo, or- or when I had the hot milk...And-and I seem to want to read Alice in Wonderland?\"\nKunikida smiled at him \"Those are a few of the things you enjoyed the most as a kid. I would give to you a cup of warm milk and honey every night and whenever you were upset. And I read to you Alice in Wonderland to sleep\"\nDazai blushed and averted his gaze again.\nDid he really do that for him?\n\"That sounds... incredibly nice\"\nKunikida chuckled \"It's the least I could do and you adored it. But Im glad you were able to create happier memories for your childhood\"\n\"I um....Can... can I hug you?\" He hurriedly asked, feeling the embarrassment wash over his body.\n\"Of course, buddy\" Kunikida smiled at the brunet, standing up and wrapping his arms protectively around him.\n\"You-\" Dazai cleared his throat \"You don't have to call me 'buddy'. Im not a kid anymore\" He muttered into the hug\n\"But would you like me to continue?\"\nDazai was silent for a bit and then Kunikida felt him nod.\n\"Im glad\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hey Chibi! wanna come over and watch Spirited Away?\"\nDazai heard a chuckle from the other line\n\"I'll be there in 5\"\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBONUS SCENE :D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You were adorable as a kid\"\n\"I was not!\" He gasped at his boyfriend\n\"Don't get me started. You'd lash onto me, you would tell me all of your little genius facts and you'd get super excited when I'd tell you I liked them\" Chuuya grinned at him\n\"Well, Chibikko, I'll let you know tha-... Wait... you listened to my facts?\" His voice turned incredibly soft\n\"Of course\"\n\"All of them?\" He emphasised\u00a0\n\"Yes\"\u00a0\nDazai blinked \"No one wanted to hear them when I was younger\"\nChuuya scoffed and rolled his eyes \"That a because they were dicks. I\u00a0 loved them\"\n\"Oh\" He mumbled, his cheeks slowly turning crimson at the praise\n\"Aw, fucking hell, Dazai. You're still as adorable\" And with that said Chuuya pulled his boyfriend into his arms\n\"Stop it Chibi! You're supposed to be the cute one!\" He cried out as he squirmed, but made no intention of actually moving from Chuuya's arms\n\"Dazai?\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Even though you're not a kid anymore you can still tell me your little genius facts, you know?\" Chuuya said, gently brushing his bangs out of his face\n\"What?\"\n\"If it makes you happy, I'd love to hear them\"\n\"Oh. Even the boring ones?\" He teased but Chuuya shook his head\n\"None of them are boring coming from you, Mackerel\" He grinned at his boyfriend\u00a0\n\"Chibi is stupid\" and Chuuya barked a laugh\n\"And you're just flustered\" He teased\n\"Haaaaaaah? Take that back you idiot! No Im not flustered!\" But the red in the tip of his ears said otherwise\n\"In your dreams, asshole. Come on, tell me something I won't know\" He nudged the brunet's shoulder \n\"Thats a lot of things\"\nThere was a whack to his head\n\"Okay! Jesus!...mmmm... did you know the equatorial radius of Neptune is 24,764 km, making it the smallest of the gas giants in the solar system?\"\nChuuya grinned \"There's my genius\"\nDazai didn't reply, but the butterflies in his stomach were overwhelming him just from just a stupid phrase.\n\"You seem to really like space, don't you?\"\nDazai nodded as he laid down on the couch, hiding his face in the crook of Chuuya's neck \"I had this one book about the solar system that I used to read every night. It really wasn't the best one ever but I had managed to steal it from a library and I cherished it with my own life. No one could know it existed so I kept it hidden for almost three years. Once they found out they made me burn it as a punishment but on the bright side, I had already memorized every word. Still, it made me... upset?... I don't know, its what I get for getting attached to things\"\n\"Yes, it's normal to feel upset. Something you liked got taken away unfairly.\" Chuuya explained, \u00a0softly scratching his boyfriends back\nThe brunet shrugged \"Mmmm... dunno, I guess\"\nChuuya sighed \"I really want to kill everyone that ever hurt you as a child. You know you never deserved a single thing that happened to you, right?\"\n\"Kinda\" Dazai grimaced\n\"Well, that's not fucking ideal, but we'll work on that\" The redhead said as he snuggled closer to him\nDazai chuckled \"Chuuya is clingy\"\n\"Why of course. I spent two weeks without my own personal bandage disposal machine. Now I get to shower you in affection and protect you from the outside world\" He half teased, because what Chuuya really wanted to do was wrap Dazai in a fluffy blanket and cuddle him forever\n\"Hey! That's my line! You're so short people would step all over you!\"\n\"Yeah, yeah. Give me a break, you know all I want is to I'll keep you safe, Osamu\"\nA full-on body shiver went through Dazai's body as he looked up at the redhead\n\nDeja vu\n\n\"That... you've said that before\"\n\"Yes, I promised your younger self to keep you safe forever and I meant it\" Chuuya explained, his hand slipping into the brown locks and scratching his scalp\u00a0\nDazai immediately melted into the touch.\n\"I guess being forever with Chibi isn't too bad\" He mumbled, feeling the magic hands of his boyfriend making him sleepier by the second\n\"It isn't?\"\u00a0\nChuuya knew that the easiest way for the brunet to fall asleep was if he was talking to him, keeping his mind from overthinking, so thats what he would do\n\"Nope... only if he gives me lots of kisses...................... n'crab\" He yawned, placing his head on the mafioso's chest\n\"I can manage that. Any other requirements, princess?\" Chuuya smirked, feeling his boyfriend slightly shiver at the pet name\n\"Mmmmm... Cuddles?\"\n\"Sure\"\n\"And back rubs\"\n\"Okay\"\n\"And head scratching\"\nChuuya snorted \"Who's the damn dog now, huh?\"\nDazai giggled\n\"m'glad m'back\"\n\"Me too\"\nAnd Dazai fell asleep.\n15 minutes later when Chuuya was about to fall asleep too, he felt his boyfriend shiver in his sleep. He detangled himself from his arms and moved to get a blanket for both of them. Just as he did that Dazai whimpered and opened his eyes at the loss of contact.\n\"Chibi?\" He called out and Chuuya felt his heart melt\n\"Shhh... Im here sweetheart. I've got you. I was just getting the blanket\" He said as he engulfed his boyfriend in his arms again, wrapping a blanket around him\n\"Mmmm\"\nChuuya cupped Dazais face with his hand and rubbed his thumb against his cheek\n\"Close your eyes, darling. Im not going anywhere\"\n\"Chu s'gonna keep me safe?\" He yawned\u00a0\n\nJust like his younger self\n\n\"Yes, Osamu. Forever\"\nDazai hummed \".... forever\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Your skin peels off of your feet in space\"\nChuuya couldn't help but giggle at his boyfriends antics \"Sleep, my little prodigy\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo months later, Chuuya did his research and bought him the space book for his birthday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he also surprised him with a trip to see the Northern lights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***"
