    "text": "On an unusually sweltering May night, Lance McClain decides that he\u2019s going to have a threesome.\nNo, not the sexy kind \u2013 though who is he to lie and say that the thought hasn\u2019t crossed his mind at least a couple of times \u2013 but he knows that he needs to get in there. He wants to earn the right to climb the makeshift stage, surrounded by the ever-growing crowd of people, and weasel in riiiiight between the two men dancing on it. The front, preferably. Lance would never settle for anything less, and the sidelines simply don\u2019t suit him.\nAfter all, he's \u201ca drama queen and an attention whore\u201d (Hunk Garrett, Pidge Gunderson, verbal conversation, May 21, 2016). He needs to\u00a0maintain that title, at least.\n\u201cIf I had a dollar for every time Shiro wore a sleeveless tight shirt, I\u2019d be a millionaire,\u201d Pidge says somewhere to his left, voice barely audible over the deafening pump of the bass, suddenly switching the medley to Jason Derulo. If Lance had a dollar for every time that singer popped up in RB\u2019s shows \u2013\n\u201cIf he stopped wearing those, then maybe Lance would finally shut up about wanting to slide across the floor to propose to him on the spot,\u201d Hunk shrugs and takes another generous bite of some crispy thing that he\u2019s devouring ever so slowly, savoring the moment. Lance can tell that he\u2019s nervous \u2013 his best friend transforms into an all-consuming black hole whenever he\u2019s feeling out of his element.\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s not my fault that he looks like an Ancient Greek god, alright? A man has urges!\u201d Lance waves him off, gaze still drawn in by the talented dancers. The crowd nearly yodels when Shiro executes a perfect jump-flip, falling into that perfect transition of powerful moves, and - wow okay, Lance needs Pidge\u2019s water bottle asap.\n\u201cLook at him! That can\u2019t be normal! He has to be a robot, I swear. No one can execute that wave with such perfection. He\u2019s got a robo arm, I\u2019m so calling it!\u201d Conspiracy theories regarding Shiro\u2019s inhuman\u2026 everything, aside, Lance firmly believes this to be true. Why else does he always wear that black\u00a0compression sleeve? Suspicious!\nHunk snorts a laugh, pushing the last bite between his crumb-covered lips. \u201cGay.\u201d\n\u201cUh, first of all, bi!\u201d Lance points one finger in his friend\u2019s face. Pidge gives them a flat stare and kicks some guy\u2019s shin when he nudges them out of the way. Don\u2019t mess with the short and angry ones. \u201cAnd if you tell me that you\u2019ve never had hots for Shiro, I might as well quit freestyling and sign up for Allura\u2019s ballet classes.\u201d\n\u201cStill pretty gay, dude.\u201d Not as gay as Lance feels when Keith does that thing with his hips.\u00a0Speaking of, \u201c\u2019Kay dudes, if we\u2019re continuing the millionaire game \u2013 if I had a dollar every time Keith shook his hips like he\u2019s Shakira himself, I\u2019d be richer than the entirety of Switzerland.\u201d\nLance feels himself drooling a little but quickly wipes at his mouth in a discreet manner. \u201cHe\u2019s a hoe, but a pretty hoe,\u201d he mutters, and Pidge - honest to god! - starts laughing at him. It\u2019s probably because his ears are an embarrassing shade of maroon. \u201cLook at him! It\u2019s like he\u2019s riding an invisible dick!\u201d Lance chokes, throwing his arms in Keith\u2019s general direction. The guy has the perfect balance and his ankles must be made of steel or some shit because it almost hurts watching him bounce like that despite how entrancing it is. Lance had tried copying this set of moves before. He ended up pulling a muscle and then proceeded to bitch everyone\u2019s ears off about it. Hunk even subjected himself to carrying him from lecture to lecture just to make him stop complaining.\nCase in point \u2013 do not attempt to ride an invisible dick unless you\u2019re Keith.\nAn unspoken \u201cwish he\u2019d ride mine\u201d hangs heavily in the air, clouding the bullshit factory that is Lance\u2019s inner world and whatnot.\nKeith and Shiro are the fucking best in their prefecture when it comes to street dance competitions, and probably secret underground beauty contests that Lance isn\u2019t aware of. They\u2019ve been at it since 2007 and haven\u2019t lost a single competition since last year\u2019s July. They\u2019ve made it to Echo\u201909 finals, came out as champions, and the rest is history - aka\u00a0everyone\u2019s interest in the\u00a0duo\u00a0kind of exploded.\nIn 2011, Pidge dragged an unwilling Lance to his first street dance show, and ever since then, he couldn\u2019t get out. He was stuck in the deep, dark hell that was crafted from Shiro\u2019s muscled arms and Keith\u2019s cursed hip shimmies. And a whole lot of \u2018work till you drop dead\u2019 training regimes. Every single day.\nAfter witnessing the RB in action for the very first time, Lance started going at it like crazy just to get a shot at competing on the same stage, just to get closer to what he considers to be the ultimate perfection of teamwork and art combined.\nWhenever Lance\u2019s Twitter feed buzzes with a new message that his idols\u00a0are going to appear at one event or another, he\u2019s immediately there, sometimes forsaking basic duties such as homework and helping out with chores.\nAlso he may or may not obsessively stalk their Twitters and other social media networks, but that is a story for another time.\nKeith falls back without a moment of hesitation. Shiro smoothly catches him with one arm as though his partner is a swooning lady \u2013 probably a daily occurrence - and propels him forward. As always the last three seconds of their performance leave Lance\u2019s mouth hanging open, and he shamelessly joins in once the noise level around him rises high enough to drown out the last few finishing beats of the medley. Keith is breathing heavily, pulling off his damp shirt, while Shiro's waving at the screaming fans with a kindhearted smile as the DJ croons out some final compliments. Lance\u2019s heart sinks once he sees Keith making a beeline in their direction. The dancer brushes by him, yet he doesn\u2019t spare the other or his friends - his team - a single look.\nLance hopes that one day he\u2019ll be able to rid himself of the shame that he feels whenever he recalls the first time he faced off Keith and massively fucked up, far too nervous and inexperienced, trying to prove himself as the better man.\nPerhaps one day he\u2019ll be good enough to make Keith finally acknowledge him, or at least, look him in the fucking eye.\nPidge checks the time on their phone as Hunk pulls Lance along to their assigned dancefloor.\nNowhere near the big leagues, but it's still good enough. They gouge some cheering even if the team that they\u2019re competing against is light-years ahead of them when it comes to breakdancing.\n\u00a0\nLance is no stranger to losing.\nHe has nothing on a natural like Keith or a hard worker like Shiro, who\u2019s been dancing even before he could read. They say that talent is merely an actively pursued hobby, and Lance is a firm believer in that, even if sometimes he feels like punching things or himself whenever his noodle arms give out and he\u2019s physically unable to hold his weight with one arm, falling face-first into the concrete. Breakdancing isn\u2019t his forte, he\u2019s much more into simple-ass hip-hop and has a love for popping and locking. If you have a lean body like this, you have to make the best of it.\nBut if he wants to be good enough, he needs to nail this one, too. Pidge tries - keyword: tries - to teach him sometimes, but it\u00a0comes\u00a0easy to them, natural, and\u00a0Pidge isn't the most patient teacher out there. They may be small, but they\u2019re strong enough to restrain Lance with only one arm whenever they wrestle for the remote and the headlock leaves Lance\u2019s thin neck aching for days. Meanwhile, Lance can fight about a thousand ants on good days.\nSadly, Pidge is a complete bookworm and a grade-A nerd, so they cannot supervise his ass 24/7, and laughing at his failures after one too many times gets kind of old. Lance\u2019s first internet fame came from a Vine compilation of him kissing the cracked pavement of the abandoned parking lot located under a closed-off bridge, the spot where they would usually meet up to practice.\nHe still remembers how not cool it was when he'd been trying to hit on his coursemate and she only responded with a \"Wait, aren\u2019t you that guy from that one Vine?\"\nAll in all, utterly and completely degrading.\nNot as degrading as fucking up in front of his idols, though.\nThere he goes again.\nWith a huff, Lance threads to his boombox and shuffles through the playlist. Nope, nope, something easier, ugh whatever, \u2018Heartbreak in the making\u2019 will suffice.\nHe closes his eyes and goes over his routine of practicing the more difficult moves and freestyling. Sweat drips down his nose, but he chooses to ignore the fact that he must look and smell gross, twisting his body in a sharp, sudden spin. Lance swipes at the air like he\u2019s trying to punch his frustration away, locks his palms with a swift movement, getting pissed when he misses a beat. He can\u2019t do it smoothly. His transitions are either too fast or too clumsy.\nHe visualizes Keith\u2019s face, Keith\u2019s slim body, visualizes success,\u00a0and knee-drops on the ground, making sure that his torso rolls in the same way that he sees in his mind. Fuck, how\u2019s that even possible? How does he make it seem so... so effortless? Does Keith take belly-dancing classes as a bonus to get in shape? His one-sided rival certainly has those breathtaking hips for it. God, what Lance wouldn\u2019t give for at least one lap dance. It\u2019d probably overshadow his eighteenth birthday strip club experience completely.\n\n\u2018Next morning I was so conflicted \u2013 \u2018\n\nLance feels his right ankle buzz with static at the slightly awkward pose. He comes back down to it and notices that he\u2019s been sitting around with his legs uncomfortably bent under him, his gaze focused on the concrete, graffiti-covered ceiling for at least a minute now. He\u2019s been visualizing Keith\u2019s skin and those cursed abs so vividly that he kind of forgot what he was supposed to be doing.\nGod, this whole competing business is killing his performance.\nRight as he closes his eyes, something cool presses against his cheek. With a startled yelp, Lance lies down on the ground, kicking out his legs. The static intensifies.\nHe hits nothing. Shit, is someone going to shank him?\n\u201cFinally trying to work yourself to your early grave?\u201d\nWhite hair blinds his vision. He smiles, half-assed, heart beating wildly from the surprise. \u201cWhat kind of unworthy knight does that? I\u2019d never leave you behind, sweet Princess,\u201d Lance croons.\nThe Princess in question drops the bottle on his face in response. It hits his nose rather painfully.\n\u201cForget that I even cared,\u201d Allura huffs, never one to take Lance\u2019s bullshit. A moment later, her sapphire eyes twinkle with seriousness. \u201cThat was pretty good until you flopped down like a dead fish and, pardon my crudeness, proceeded to have some sort of a bizarre mental mating ritual with some Keith.\u201d\nShit, did he actually repeat Keith\u2019s name like a mantra out loud? What the hell is wrong with him these days?\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t \u2013 that wasn\u2019t!\u201d Lance gapes and rakes his brain for an appropriate response. Explaining this ritual of boosting his self-confidence usually ends up getting weird. \u201cIt was just some mental stimulation to do better. Wait, that came out horribly wrong.\u201d\nShe backs away, slowly. \u201cOh-kaaay, we can stop right there. Clearly, I really don\u2019t want to know.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that,\u201d Lance scoffs and gets up with a prolonged sigh, maintaining a respectful distance from the woman. He\u2019d rather die than close the gap between them after a training session like that. He has a reputation to uphold no matter how bad he feels right now or how much he wants to get closer to her. Oh god, someone please hold him. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about my mistakes. I get mad and frustrated, and then it all falls to shit.\u201d He doesn't bother filtering his language in front of his ex-crush. She'd rejected him one time too many. \u201cAnd I just really want to reach some sort of - some sort of breakthrough, but so far it\u2019s just been \u2013 argh.\u201d He falls back down into a small patch of dainty grass growing out through the cracks in the concrete despite the lack of sun. Lance can relate, and shit, is he seriously relating to weeds now?\nTo his surprise, Allura follows and settles next to him, hugging her knees close to her chest. Her legs bend a little awkwardly due to the white high heels that she's wearing. They sit in contemplative silence, an unusual occurrence when you\u2019re stuck with someone like Lance of all the people, so naturally, his companion feels the urge to point it out. \u201cYou usually don\u2019t get so\u2026 serious. Though I- I understand, actually. I mean that \u2018sissy dancing\u2019 or so you\u2019ve called it \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cAllura, I apologized for that like a million times already. I\u2019m the one who permanently lives in salt mines, not you.\u201d She literally pirouetted him into stunned silence about a year ago when they had visited her during a class that she was co-teaching, and the leotard-clad young ladies didn\u2019t take kindly to his self-absorbed bullshit. Lance doesn\u2019t like talking about it. Surprisingly, neither do Pidge and Hunk.\nAllura chooses to ignore him. \u201cI was stuck once, too, you know. I was envious of my upperclassmen whenever I saw them performing. But one day, I realized that the so-called grand difference between us was simply the extra time that they put into practice, along with their feelings and hearts. If you follow that regime, you\u2019re bound to catch up eventually. You mustn\u2019t stop when things get hard.\u201d She stands, and with a graceful movement, falls into the third position, followed by a perfect arabesque. Her balance is perfect. \u201cYou\u2019re still learning, Lance. It's alright to mess up because it\u2019s how you get better. And if you ask me, all you need is some endurance training and extra work on your balance. The moves are already a part of you. Own them.\u201d\nThe cold gust of wind makes the sheen of sweat dry instantly. Lance runs his fingers through his short brown hair, letting it stick up. He\u2019d be lying if he said that Allura\u2019s speech didn\u2019t make him a little teary-eyed. It\u2019s nice to get some reassurance every now and then, especially from someone who\u2019s a master at what they do.\nShe then claps her hands together, offering a blinding white smile. \u201cThat being said, get back to practicing and show me what you got! Impress me, Lance! Afterwards, I\u2019ll give you an utmost objective critique.\u201d\nShe urges him on despite his protests and shame \u2013 he is not ready to show off to Allura if he can\u2019t show off to people like Keith and Shiro \u2013 so he reluctantly\u00a0plays a new song, the beat fast-paced and a bit above Lance\u2019s skill level. But this is what he wants. To see what he\u2019s doing wrong and to get some pointers.\nWhen he hesitates before falling into a knee-drop, Allura claps her hands once more in a steady rhythm. \u201cGood, good, show no hesitation! Keep going!\u201d\nBy the time it's over, he\u2019s completely out of breath, a fine layer of sweat coating his lean body. He heaves while Allura claps as though she\u2019s at some high-class ballet show instead of watching a dumbass 22-year-old flailing away. It\u2019s enough to make Lance grin and he bows, overly pompous. \u201cThank you, thank you, my audience is too kind.\u201d\n\u201cYour audience is about to criticize you, so I hope you\u2019re mentally prepared.\u201d Allura stops smiling and looks him up and down with a light frown etched between her sharp eyebrows, a fingertip tapping against painted lips. \u201cYou definitely lack strength training. Your breakdancing could use it. That one-hand scissor kick, show it to me again. Quick!\u201d\nLance blinks in confusion. \u201cSince when are you familiar with the terms?\u201d\nAllura bats her eyelashes back. \u201cSince forever. I have an acquaintance who is overwhelmingly good at this if I do say so myself, and we tend to use the same hall when practicing new moves. Now go for it!\u201d There is no room left for arguments. With a shaky arm Lance tries to comply. He ends up kissing the pavement, unsurprisingly.\nHe spends the next half an hour going over every combination that had struck Allura as odd and he\u2019s actually surprised when he gets a lot of useful tips. He can\u2019t believe that he used to downplay Allura\u2019s competence because of the whole \u2018ballet is for little girls\u2019 thing. She\u2019s incredible and he\u2019s honestly undeserving of this hospitality.\n\u201cAt this point, you might as well start coaching us.\u201d Lance laughs when Allura squints at him as he finishes up the snaking and waving combo, his body rigid from exertion.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d\nLance chokes on his spit.\n\u201dR-really, that\u2019s alright, I \u2013\u201d His voice cracks embarrassingly at the end.\n\u201cLook, do you want to prepare in time for this year\u2019s Echo, or not? Because I, personally, think that you could use all the help that you can get. And I\u2019d rather you not go out there and show the crowd a bad performance!\u201d She uses the Mom Voice on him, sticking out her lips in a defiant manner. To top it off, she places her hands on slim hips as if daring him to talk back.\nLance\u2019s shoulders sag when he towels himself off. He could really use a bath. \u201cWhat\u2019s next? Coran is a secret bboyer?\u201d\n\u201cActually \u2013 \u201d\nToo much for one day. Lance throws his arms into the air. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m done. Nope nope nope, goodbye.\u201d\nAnd so, Allura begins showing up every Tuesday and Thursday evening to relentlessly order Lance around, clapping a firm beat for him to fall into until he\u2019s close to collapsing \u2013 or, well, actually collapses. It doesn\u2019t take much. He whines for water breaks that are meant to mask his heaving, but she takes none of it.\n\u201cYou can rest after you show me a plausible transition. One, two, go!\u201d\nIt\u2019s kind of hellish but Lance can feel himself getting whipped into shape nonetheless. It\u2019s somewhat surprising that Allura is sticking to her pompous dance schools instead of commanding army troops.\n\u00a0\nThey blow through the Summer competition prelims like it\u2019s a slight breeze instead of an all-out battle.\nHunk crushes him and Pidge in a back-shattering hug once they win the right to enter the finals.\n\u00a0\nHe can finally hold down the little caramel-haired Satan when they try to switch the channel from Lance\u2019s telenovela to boring documentaries.\n\u201cSince when can you do that?\u201d Pidge huffs out, and scratches at Lance\u2019s forearms to free themselves.\nLance places the remote under his ass - the one place that Pidge doesn\u2019t dare to poke around - and flexes, kissing his naked bicep. \u201cSince I got these guns, baby, aw yeah. I am the fucking strong.\u201d\n\u201cThose are tiny plastic water pistols at best. You\u2019re still a noodle,\u201d Pidge groans in defeat \u2013 haha, how does that one feel, sucka - and gets up.\n\u201cA noodle who can finally carry the team through the finals with mad bboying skills.\u201d\nIn a sudden rush of overwhelming sentimentality, Pidge grabs his face and looks deeply into his eyes. \u201cLance, I love you and I\u2019m proud.\u201d It\u2019s followed by a firm tug on the back of his neck. He falls off the sofa, magically getting a carpet burn in the process. \u201cBut you\u2019re still an ass and that remote is mine.\u201d They reclaim the device with a cocky smile and wave it in front of his face.\nLance doesn\u2019t get to hear who Jose\u2019s biological father is, which is, like, unforgivable.\nLeave it to Pidge to ruin their bonding moment.\n\u00a0\nLance feels like there\u2019s an entire tree stuck in his eye when he finally holds onto the outfits that Pidge had painstakingly designed - color-coded and adorned in neon stripes - for the very first time.\nThey hug and cry like weenies when they win their first tournament.\n\u00a0\nOctober brings colder weather, brown leaves, Pumpkin spice lattes, Halloween, and Lance\u2019s absolute favorite \u2013 Halloween-themed dance competitions.\nAs such, he doesn\u2019t mind it when Hunk splashes the upper part of his face in dark blue paint that he'd mixed up at Chem class and only mildly complains when that shit gets in his eyes because it stings. They also have an all-out verbal battle about whether they should wear those glowy cat ears or not. Pidge and Hunk, who are undeniably passionate about all things cute and cuddly, out-vote Lance, only on condition that Hunk attaches the ears to his hood instead. They\u2019re cute blue things that look kind of awkward when perched on top of his head - probably because of the short hair and his long face - and he\u2019s only a little envious that he can\u2019t pull them off like his friends do.\nAs punishment for pulling his hood on at inappropriate times and saying \u2018You know like nya\u2019, Lance gets subjected to a very intense nail-painting session, courtesy of Pidge. His younger siblings love the way it looks, so maybe it isn\u2019t too bad - apparently, Pidge got a whole lot better at this - and they\u2019re more than happy to paint McClains' nails a soft coral blue that glows in the dark.\nThey wait in the long ass line at the entrance, surrounded by people wearing all kinds of outfits, and by the time it\u2019s their turn to get stamped, Lance counts at least eleven sexy nurses. Nice.\nHe pulls on the cat-eared hood once they wiggle their way past the masses and the security \u2013 Lance makes a few jokes about the police outfits and gets deathly glares in return \u2013 and Pidge threatens him with a hiss. \u201cI swear to god if you do the thing again \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cWhat thing? Oh, you mean \u2013 \u201d His hand automatically rises to his head, curling.\n\u201cLance,\u201d Hunk groans in exasperation. \u201cDon\u2019t do that, please, I\u2019m gonna have nightmares.\u201d\n\u201cOh, what\u2019s that now? Can\u2019t hear you over the music there, pal, what do you want me to do, again? You know\u00a0\u2013 nya?\u201d\nPidge and Hunk throw their arms in the air, earning some confused stares from those around them. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible to take out, you know that, right?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure anyone would take me out, am I right or am I right?\u201d He double-pistols at some girl who only curls up her nose and stomps away. Huh, maybe he deserved it.\nHunk places a comforting hand on his bony shoulder and they entertain themselves with a little game of 'I Spy' while they wait for the competitions to start. After Hunk spies yet another sexy cop, the game turns a little boring.\nThat is until, in the dim lights, Lance spots the undeniable shape of a man who plagues his mind and frequently co-stars in his wettest dreams. Motherfucking Keith.\nLance chokes when the wandering red strobe light lands on that familiar mullet \u2013 it\u2019s not weird that I can recognize it like forty feet away, you guys, what are you on about \u2013 and Lance\u2019s jaw almost hits the sticky floor.\nHunk stares as well. \u201cDude.\u201d\n\u201cOhhh my God, oh my God, what is he wearing!?\u201d Lance screeches indignantly, face brighter than the flashing lights above. He could be a beacon of sexual tension. \u201cWho let him dress himself? Shiro is a well-respected adult with morals! He\u2019d never allow - !\u201d He places his fingerless glove-clad palms over Pidge\u2019s eyes. \u201cThere are children in the vicinity, goddamn it!\u201d\nPidge elbows him in the ribs with a heated \u201cFuck off, Lance!\u201d \u2013 \u201cChildren shouldn\u2019t curse\u201d, he says, earning another smack - while his gaze latches onto Keith\u2019s figure. He looks a little awkward because of the attention that he\u2019s getting from all sides. At least, he could\u2019ve done something with his ridiculous hair if he truly wanted to stay unnoticed and blend in. Mullets aren't unnoticed nowadays. Keith probably didn't get that memo.\n\u201cIs he supposed to be like a sexy corpse bride, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d Pidge attempts to fix their oversized glasses, only to belatedly remember that they\u2019re wearing contacts. To save themselves from the impending embarrassment due to the small slip-up, Pidge awkwardly pinches the bridge of their nose.\nHunk raises one fine eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ve been living with Lance\u2019s family for how long now, and \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Day of the Dead get-up, you walnut,\u201d Lance screeches, throat feeling very dry. His eyes roam all over Keith\u2019s slender body. \u201cExcept it\u2019s totally disrespectful - who the fuck wears a goddamn crop top with that, ugh, ughhh.\u201c He is in a lot of distress, truth be told. Keith\u2019s stupid clothes cling to his body like a second skin and the colorful paint makes him, god forbid, cute.\nSuddenly it\u2019s very hard to tell the difference\u00a0between checking out a\u00a0rival to mock him and checking out a guy whose bones he must absolutely jump. And here Lance was thinking that all those wet dreams were some sort of bizarre side-effect of the intense rivalry that he was feeling.\nLance looks up at Hunk, teary-eyed. \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m gay for Keith.\u201d\nHis best friend only stares like this isn\u2019t news to him, as though Lance had said it a million times already. The revelation feels severely downplayed - what about the ground-shattering surprised looks, the indignant gasps, and the drama? Instead, Hunk just says, \u201cWe know. Not to sound rude or anything, but I told you so. Multiple times, by the way, but who ever listens to Hunk, am I right?\u201d He\u2019s far too smug to sound genuinely upset by that.\nLance looks down at his quivering palms. \u201cHe is so cute. Man, I wanna go there and rub my face all over that \u2013 \u201d He channels the Mexican side of his family and babbles away in heated Spanish about the things he\u2019d do to goddamn Keith and his stupid \u2013 what were those even? Leggings? It doesn't go too smoothly, because by now, his friends know just enough of the language to make disgusted faces and simultaneously echo a \u2018Sick, dude!\u2019\n\u201cOkay, stop stop stop, or I\u2019ll tell Ma to wash your mouth with soap when we get back.\u201d Pidge sticks out their tongue.\n\u201cCan she wash my ears while she\u2019s at it, too?\u201d Hunk winces. \u201cI feel severely violated here, man!\u201d\n\u201cHow about you bathe me in the holy waters of Jerusalem, because hot damn.\u201d Lance fans himself when Keith and, oh, there\u2019s Shiro, too, make their way to the dancefloor. \u201cHe can be the La Muerte to my Xibalba any day.\u201d\nAnother sexy priest walks by. Hunk kindly asks him to perform an exorcism on Lance\u2019s sorry, smitten ass to make him stop sinning. Even after he gets hit with a plastic cross a few times, the sin remains.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that they stole our song! They may be hot, but it\u2019s our jam!\u201d Lance stomps his foot like a petulant child when the first beats of \u2018Make it Shake\u2019 rile up the massive crowd. His body tenses as though on impulse, he\u2019s the one supposed to be dancing to this. The routine is ingrained into the very core of his being, hours upon hours of actually practicing the same moves instead of freestyling everything on the spot.\n\u201cWell, we can\u2019t just charge in. Remember what happened last time?\u201d Hunk gestures wildly, looking as though he\u2019s going to be sick. \u201cI\u2019m not having a repeat of... that.\u201d\nLance can\u2019t blame him, that particular fuck up forever a sore subject to the members of their small team. He remembers the haunting booing of the crowd and the indecipherable look that Keith had sent his way, as though he'd proven his point that Lance was inferior to him. That he would always be.\n\u201cCome back when you actually learn how to dance, idiot,\u201d Keith hissed into Lance\u2019s ear, and the brunet had nothing else left to do but curl his imaginary tail and dash off the stage.\nBut that was in the past, and this... \u201cThis is it, our great breakthrough, guys. I can feel it. It\u2019s like all of the planets are aligned for us.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s just your dick talking.\u201d Pidge interrupts, looking quite queasy themselves.\n\u201cNo, guys, listen! We have to. We have to do this, it'll be a good experience. We may not be  quite there yet, but we can still wipe the floor with them. I believe in you. Hunk!\u201d He turns to the taller man gnawing on his fingernails. \u201cThere\u2019s no one out there who\u2019s better than you at popping. Pretty boy won't stand a chance!\u201d Hunk turns bright red at the praise and scratches the back of his neck, muttering something shyly.\nLance turns to Pidge, but they cut him off. \u201cLet me guess, this is the part where you give me a pep talk about my breakdancing.\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely!\u201d\n\u201cAnd what about you? Are you truly feeling ready? Last time we kinda...\u201d They hold their elbow close to their side in a display of insecurity. \u201cYou\u2019re our frontman, Lance. We\u2019ll fall apart if you screw it up.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we won\u2019t fail! Otherwise, Allura is going to kick my ass to another galaxy and then back.\u201d He pulls his friends close. \u201cNow, are you with me or not?\u201d\nSeemingly affected by all the praise and the good atmosphere, Hunk is the first one to nod. Then again, he always goes with Lance\u2019s ideas, no matter how crazy. It\u2019s what kept earning him the title of Lance\u2019s best friend for eight consecutive years in a row. \u201cTill the end of the line, pal.\u201d It certainly shows that they had a 'Captain America' movie marathon yesterday. \u201cLet\u2019s kick some ass!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to hear!\u201d They exchange a complicated handshake, followed by a brofist. Pidge remains cautious. \u201cC\u2019mon, it\u2019s an opportunity. They probably don\u2019t even remember us.\u201d They weren\u2019t the first ones to challenge the champions, not by a long shot. Lance knows that for a fact. \u201cIt\u2019s Halloween, we\u2019re kind of well-masked from the shame here.\u201d\nPidge finally relents. Lance looks over his shoulder in a rush of excitement. \u201cWhat team!?\u201d he yells when they make a circle.\n\u201cWild cats!\u201d Pidge yells back, while Hunk stops mid \"Vol-\"\n\u201cNot quite, but I\u2019ll make this meme count!\u201d\n\nThree, two, one.\n\nLance jumps into the spotlight.\n\u00a0\n\n\u2018Guess who just walked in!\u2019\n\nThe crowd lets out an appraising roar that is equal amounts of discontent and supportive when Lance crashes Keith\u2019s little show for the second time in his life. The reaction that he gets is exactly the same as the last time, except it seems that Keith doesn\u2019t immediately write him off as a 'cocky newbie' because of their glorious uniforms.\nThat detail is immediately noticed by the DJ of the night, whose voice Lance recognizes by heart. It booms loud and clear, the music dying down for a moment. \u201cLooks like Team Voltron still can\u2019t find themselves a satisfactory place in the pro-leagues after the last championship! Maybe tonight is their lucky night!\u201d\nOkay, maybe Lance was wrong, they\u2019re not that well-masked. Ha, no pressure.\nHe doesn\u2019t hear the rest of their introduction followed by their sob story because his body goes on autopilot, faster than ever before, ready to take some breaths away. Allura would be floored.\nThe crowd seemingly fades away, reduced to distant, shapeless noise, yet he somehow knows that Pidge and Hunk are keeping up with him just fine. Keith and Shiro circle their gang like two vultures, Shiro's smile almost playful \u2013 that guy always remains too kind even after he\u2019s done absolutely slaying someone on the dancefloor \u2013 and Keith\u2026\nOh god, Keith.\nKeith finally looks at them with a shine of interest gleaming in his eyes, one that only surfaces once every three tournaments. Lance knows that. Fueled by Keith's undivided attention, he puts extra effort into a rushed windmill, switching combinations like it's nothing. The beautiful dancer raises his eyebrows when Lance all but slides towards him in a very krumping fashion, shoulders roughly thrown back \u2013 which he kind of despises, as it is far too fuckboyish and immature even for his taste. He\u00a0has standards. Keith\u2019s face is still kept carefully emotionless, though Lance can see that he\u2019s trying to fight back the beginnings of\u00a0a smile. Totally a smile, Lance decides, when his snapback sails through the air and he doesn\u2019t have to look around to catch it. He puts it on his head, but not before pulling a fancy flip.\nAnd,\u00a0holy shit, Keith actually grins.\nLance\u2019s heart somersaults, knees a little weak. He kind of wants to clutch at his chest and die right on this dancefloor that he absolutely owns. The crowd cheers and Lance breathes heavily, doesn\u2019t have to visualize success for the first time in his life because it\u2019s standing right in front of him in the shape of a mulleted man with a very damn tight black crop top.\nIf he looks close enough, he can point out all of the specks of indigo in Keith\u2019s eyes, and only then does he realize that Keith is standing incredibly close to him, their noses a few inches apart at most. The black-haired man searches Lance's gaze for something, something that would make him recognizable perhaps, hand hovering near Lance\u2019s cheek as though tempted to wipe off the mixture of electric and cobalt blue paint ending just below his cheekbones.\nLance\u2019s eyes flick down to Keith's mouth, because goddamn, it is so tempting. Briefly, he entertains the idea of closing the gap even though he still has Hunk around, who is like 70% of his impulse control - but hey, his friend is currently standing somewhere to his right, and is completely out of the range, thus incapable of smacking some common sense into Lance's empty head.\nHe wants to kiss Keith so much, and yeah, read into it however you want, they\u2019re so having a moment\u00a0here. He\u00a0can see that Keith's obviously interested - what kind of interest, though, he doesn\u2019t entirely know yet.\nAnd oh shit (!!!) the distance shrinks until it doesn't (???).\nLance stands completely frozen, wide-eyed with surprise, when Keith casually steals his hat and swiftly jumps out of Lance\u2019s reach, followed by\u00a0a curt\u00a0nod in Shiro\u2019s direction.\n\u201cWhat a goddamn tease. How\u2019s he even real?\u201d Lance mutters to himself and stares away, dumbstruck.\nThose words ring undeniably true because Keith really is a god-awful tease who is not afraid to prove himself. The next song in the medley turns out to be far too sensual for Lance's comfort, and damn boy, that hip shimmy is way hotter up close. It's right there and it's real, so unlike the one that Lance sometimes visualizes before going to bed when he \u2013\nKeith executes that perfect drop \u2013 Madre de Dios, help him, he\u2019s gonna rest in bloody pieces right then and there \u2013 and when he turns around with a soft, effortless bounce, he pulls the hat back on Lance\u2019s head, momentarily obscuring his field of vision. The heat of Keith's palm burns Lance\u2019s exposed chest with the brunet positively dying at this physical contact, but it\u2019s a small torture to bear because Keith roughly shoves him away, making him stumble back.\nLance, despite his internal raging boner soon to turn into the real deal, still feels very offended by such treatment. Just who the fuck does Keith think he is? He kinda wants to reach out, grab him and do something, but Pidge holds him back by the hood, dragging him backwards. \u201cPlaytime\u2019s over, lover boy, you've proven your point.\u201d\n\u201cBut!\u201d\n\u201cNo buts. I think you\u2019ve had more than enough butts for one evening. Don\u2019t let it get to your head too much.\u201d Did Pidge just pun him? Lance, however, has no time to appreciate it, because his eyes lock with Keith\u2019s, and the guy smirks at him like the absolute butt that he is. Lance flicks him the bird, almost tripping over his own feet when Keith wiggles his fingers in a smug wave, somewhat mockingly blowing him a kiss.\n\u201cI am deceased,\u201d he says to no one in particular, one hand resting on his chest. It\u2019s too noisy. The crowd\u2019s focus shifts back to Shiro\u2019s robotic tricks and insane inverts in no time. Hunk gets swept away by his newly-formed fanclub, while Pidge - the sad adoptive sibling constantly stuck with Lance McClain\u2019s ever-fluctuating moods - heaves a sigh.\n\u201cWell, he is your La Muerte.\u201d\n\u201cS\u00ed\u00ed\u00ed\u00ed\u00ed.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t see Keith or Shiro for the rest of the night.\n\u00a0\nLance is roughly shaken awake at 6 am. He gets ready to use his 'older sibling authority' and kick his sister out of his room, but gets subjected to even more jostling which can only belong to Pidge. \u201cWake up, you jerkoff.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t jerk off,\u201d Lance murmurs in defense and attempts to pull the covers over his head. They got back home at 3 am and then he spent the next 45 minutes of his \"alone time\" thinking about Keith, probing at the burning patch of skin located at the center of his chest. He didn\u2019t violate that sacred moment though, so it was true, even if he didn\u2019t understand half of Pidge\u2019s screechy voice. \u201cJus\u2019 another five mins\u2026\u201d\nHe\u2019s rudely awakened by water on his face. With a scream, he sits up. \u201cChrist, what the fuck\u2019s your problem!?\u201d\nThe screaming earns angry thudding from the other side of the wall.\nPidge actually looks ashamed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ma!\u201d they apologize. The thudding stops. His damn Ma, always playing favorites.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the fire?\u201d Lance wipes away the sleep crust from his lashes. He was having a very nice dream. \u201cWhat\u2019s got your panties in a twist?\u201d Like, literally. Pidge is in front of him in all of their almost-naked glory - only in underwear and a haphazardly thrown-on binder. How they're awake at this hour Lance will never know, then again, he often doubts that Pidge ever sleeps.\nPidge\u2019s expression is twisted up when they shove a phone into Lance\u2019s face. He hisses at the sudden invading light. The phone vibrates with their group chat notifications, flooded by Hunk\u2019s messages. Lance catches something along the lines of \u2018This is horrible\u2019.\nIt\u2019s an article. The header screams: \u2018A shooting near Black Lion\u2019s nightclub, one severely injured.\u2019\nLance\u2019s heart stops beating.\nHoly shit, this is the same place where they spent the night.\nHe skims the article, feeling very cold. \u201c\u2026opened sudden fire\u201d, \u201c\u2026multiple witnesses, mass confusion\u201d, \u201c\u2026illegal betting centers\u201d, and finally:\n\n\u201cA member of RB, the local, internet-famous dance crew, undefeated in street dance competitions for over a year, Takashi Shirogane (more known under the alias of \u201cShiro\u201d) has been severely wounded by three shots to the right side, and was immediately rushed off to the hospital.\u201d\n\nLance stops reading upon reaching the black bold letters spelling\u00a0\u2018critical condition\u2019.\nThey sit in a stuffy silence. Pidge eyes him warily, as though they want to say something, but stuff like \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 isn\u2019t going to cut it in this situation. They reclaim their phone and open the group chat to reply to Hunk.\nLance sits completely still and then makes a mad lunge for his charging phone, cursing colorfully when it doesn\u2019t immediately turn on. He goes on Twitter, and with shaky fingers, scrolls through the mass confusion shit-spam, along with numerous condolences directed at his team of idols - #prayforshiro is trending - until he finds Keith\u2019s message.\n\n\u2018Team RB is officially disbanded.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s like a sharp stab with an icicle to his stomach.\u00a0Hearing\u00a0this from the official source freezes up his insides.\n\u00a0\nThey drop out of that year\u2019s Echo tournament. Lance continues practicing, but his drive dies more and more with every passing month.\nLance is an avid believer in fateful encounters, Zodiacs, curses, destiny, the theory that his next door neighbor is an alien, and starting today, pizza rolls.\nCorrelation? None, it may seem. But pizza rolls are the true MVPs\u00a0that kickstart the gears of Lance\u2019s destiny. He\u2019d kiss Pidge if it wasn\u2019t a gross thought.\nHowever, when he first hears about the pizza roll thing, he\u2019s far too tired and grumpy to react. He wants to be left alone with his scattered thoughts, courtesy of crippling depression which only the university manages to bring out even though it\u2019s summer. As expected, he has to retake his Statistics exam. God damn it, who even cares about logic and combinatorics? His professor, who never fails to remind Lance that he\u2019s a waste of space in the great world of mathematics, apparently.\n\u2018If train B goes at 200 mph and the apple basket weighs a pound, then what is the mass of the sun divided by the fridge\u2019s color\u2019, his ass. \u201cGet your own damn pizza rolls, Pidglet,\u201d he groans. He has like two whole weeks left to learn this crap and he\u2019d much rather take a nap. Ten naps. Nap himself into a coma so that he doesn\u2019t have to see another math-related question ever again.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been staring at the wall and drooling for the last fifteen minutes,\u201d they say and continue scrolling through some coding program, bloodshot eyes searching for any mistakes. During summers Pidge absolutely flourishes with their freelance work. Goddamn lucky. And then there\u2019s Lance - jobless, mooching off his family\u2019s food, flunking exams. \u201cAir your pea-sized brain before it dies. I can\u2019t reprogram it, sadly. And while you\u2019re at it, you can buy me the rolls.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the ones we have?\u201d\n\u201cYou just ate the whole bag, pea-brain.\u201d Lance stares for a moment until he realizes that the bag is sitting on the desk in front of him, and it's indeed open. His brain must've been frying so badly that he didn\u2019t notice taking the snacks. They were bought by Pidge, so it's only fair game that he should be the one going out to restock. He\u2019s a decent human being despite bitching enough to make it seem otherwise.\nLance still recalls The Nacho Incident when he stole Pidge\u2019s salsa-flavored crisps like a fool with a death wish and in a brilliant moment of thought association, fear for his life, and a need to save his own ass combined, he left a post-it note by the empty bag with the word \u2018sorry\u2019 scribbled on it and then bailed to Hunk\u2019s. Hunk wasn\u2019t too hot on saving Lance\u2019s ass when an enraged Pidge called him and asked if Lance was there.\n\u201cYou stole Pidge\u2019s food? Not cool, man,\u201d he reprimanded, Pidge put on speaker between them.\n\u201cThat was one time!\u201d\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t land from nacho heaven with small nacho wings for you to devour, you dolt, it\u2019s my hard-earned money!\u201d Pidge had yelled and relayed that they\u2019d be coming over in ten.\nIt was a horrible experience and he does not want to repeat it.\nSo with minimal bitching, Lance pulls on his sneakers, pushes back the fat Persian cat Pepe \u2013 he\u2019s good at naming things, really \u2013 who\u2019s trying to sneak out to play with the neighbor\u2019s tabby as always, and hops onto the bike. The chain is still making weird rattling sounds but Lance has kept that thing in oil for a few days, too busy to do anything else about it. He prays that it doesn\u2019t fall off, not too eager to touch it.\nOf course, his phone chooses to ring at that very moment, and he has to balance the handlebar while speaking to his little sis. \u201cS\u2019up?\u201d\n\u201cBuy me some apple juice and a chicken salad.\u201d Straight to the point as ever.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you tell me when I was leaving? Where are you right now?\u201d\nShe sounds upset with him and judging by the noise level in the background \u2013 definitely higher than the ever-present one of their home \u2013 she\u2019s probably out, wandering. There are too many people living in their small house for Lance to keep up with who's returning and who\u2019s leaving. \u201cIt\u2019s Friday!\u201d she says it like it\u2019s supposed to explain everything.\n\u201cUh huh?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m at the dance camp, idiota!\u201d Em bristles, and ohhh right. Lance has to play it cool like he totally knew that. This small piece of information slipped away from his brain completely the moment Allura had mentioned something about gathering up her students for their seasonal dance camp. It was more like a prolonged sleepover that lasted about five days, and \u2013 wait. \u201cAre you at the Studio right now?\u201d\n\u201cYeah? I told you that I\u2019ll be staying there like a bajillion times already.\u201d\nLance squints, avoiding a hole in the pavement. \u201cThere\u2019s a convenience store literally three buildings away and you\u2019re asking me - calling me - to go halfway across the town and buy you some goddamn chicken salad.\u201d\nHe can almost visualize Em slowly blinking like he\u2019s the young shitty sibling here instead of her. \u201cUh, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cMight as well rename myself to fucking delivery boy,\u201d Lance mumbles, grumpy.\nHe\u2019s never gotten along with Em too well, she's a complete shit to him, but if he's honest, maybe he had it coming all along because he used to be a pretty bad sibling when she was just a baby. Never forget the ruined Barbies, followed by destroyed math homework in retaliation \u2013 chewed up, technically, but Lance's homeroom teacher did not buy those stuttered excuses of his sister eating his homework. He should\u2019ve lied and said that it was their dog's fault, but nothing would've saved him from that F.\nShould he blame Em for his future exam failure, too?\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell Ma that you\u2019re cursing.\u201d\n\u201cWell, hold that thought, because she can hear you whining a whole town away.\u201d Lance checks the vibrating phone. An incoming call from \u2018Sauron\u2019 flashes on the screen, waiting for the line to free up. Ma truly lives up to the All-Seeing Eye title. He changes lines. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cLance, hijo, did Emilia leave already?\u201d His mother sounds too worried, as always. She\u2019s probably on her way back home from work if she has the time to call and check-in.\n\u201cMhm.\u201d\n\u201cDid she take everything?\u201d\nHow\u2019s he supposed to know that? Ma doesn\u2019t wait for an answer, instead worrying over things Em might\u2019ve forgotten, such as her food \u2013 whimsical brat, right? \u2013 sleeping bag, and a change of clean clothes. She makes it sound like her child has left for three months to hike in the Himalayas instead of a camp fifteen minutes away.\n\u201cLance, I need you to go there and bring her a warm change of clothes! The nights are so chilly this week, I don\u2019t want her catching a cold.\u201d\n\u201cBut Ma - \u201d\n\u201cClothes! Go immediately! Now!\u201d she snips, and he barely suppresses a groan, knowing fully well that he\u2019d get an earful if she caught him doing so. He misses the days when he was the little sibling.\n\u201cS\u00ed, Mam\u00e1.\u201d\nConfirmation is all that she needs, and hangs up the moment Lance resigns himself to his fate.\nHe turns the bike around, pizza rolls already forgotten. \u201cSo\u2026 chicken with cheese or chicken with nuts and tomatoes?\u201d\nEm seems pleased.\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t dislike Em or any of his siblings, even if they do fight at times \u2013 with some more than the others \u2013 like most families out there. Lance just doesn\u2019t really get Em specifically, they\u2019re way too different. He\u2019s the prankster, the extrovert, and a little bit more all over the place than it's socially acceptable, while she\u2019s refined, incredibly smart, just as friendly \u2013 a McClain family trait - but rather picky when it comes to interacting with new people. They don\u2019t see eye-to-eye about many things and topics, starting from stuff like spicy food vs sweet and sour dishes, and ending with political views and whatnot.\nEm is a first-year student in Allura\u2019s ballet class with a bright future ahead. Lance is a freestyle dancer with what could be considered a tragic backstory and ex-dreams of tournaments.\nHe stepped out of the spotlight on the day RB fell apart - more than a year ago now, wow, time sure flies by - and he has no plans of returning to the big stages anytime soon.\nSo naturally, when Lance navigates the all-too-familiar hallways, equipped with a bag of goods for his little sister, his thin eyebrows nearly rise into his hairline the moment he takes a good look at 'the kids' \u2013 let\u2019s be honest, that dancer group looks his age \u2013 dressed in the kinds of clothes that Lance has never seen in Allura\u2019s camps. The group of teens chilling by one of the beautifully carved columns gives him a critical eye. Lance evades them and quickly climbs to the second floor, finally finding the kids that he recognizes to be the ballet dancers. There are way too many of them gathered here, milling about and chattering, laughing away.\nHe looks for his sister, for a glimpse of curly brown hair, but finds Allura instead.\nShe notices his tall, lean figure almost immediately and politely excuses herself. Lance waves at her companions and the ladies return the gesture with warm smiles on their faces. He loves them - honestly, they make some banging sweets and never fail to invite him into the office for some tea whenever he drops by to pick up Allura.\nThe aforementioned woman is dressed in her coaching outfit - a deep blue thing made of shiny material that hugs her curves nicely. Her mass of white hair stands on the top of her head, clipped into a huge, tight bun \u2013 how she manages to make it stay like that Lance\u2019ll never know because for some reason Allura doesn\u2019t like sharing beauty secrets.\n\u201cLance!\u201d she exclaims, pleasantly surprised, and folds her hands neatly. \u201cSo you\u2019ve changed your mind and decided to come!\u201d\nLance holds up a dismissive hand and then the bag, shaking it a few times. \u201cUh, before you delve into a speech about how I\u2019ve finally reached the eye-opening moment and realized the value of dance camps \u2013 no I haven\u2019t, they still suck, and I\u2019m just a delivery boy for Em.\u201d He looks around, ignoring Allura\u2019s tight-lipped pout. \u201cHave you seen her around? She\u2019s too short for me to find. Also, what\u2019s up with all those kids on the first floor?\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t get an answer because Em tugs on his sweatshirt's sleeve and takes Lance\u2019s free hand, shaking it to the sides. She seems very excited, her face dusted in a light shade of pink. \u201cLance, holy shit.\u201d\n\u201cLanguage,\u201d he parrots back because he\u2019s a mature adult.\nShe\u2019s already dressed in her leotard and wearing one of Lance\u2019s old, oversized AC/DC hoodies. Em pays him no heed and continues bouncing around like a rabbit on crack, long braid whipping around. \u201cThe street dance kids\u2019 coach is like the hottest human being to exist on the face of the earth, I swear you gotta see this.\u201c That explains Em\u2019s starstruck expression. Ah, crushes. She also knows how weak-kneed Lance gets around cute, hot boys.\nHis mind is still somewhat focused on the mention of street dance kids, eyebrows furrowing, but he doesn't get to\u00a0question the women because Em drags him away from Allura and deeper into the masses of teens standing around near the grand staircase.\n\u201cJeez, just how hot is this guy? 'Disney prince in real life' kind of hot?\u201d he asks, now very curious himself, and curtly apologizes whenever Em\u2019s provision bag smacks against someone\u2019s legs.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about the kindness levels, yep! And he\u2019s even better!\u201d\n\u201cSounds like a real dreamboat,\u201d Lance laughs. \u201cSo, is he young Hugh Jackman kind of hot?\u201d\n\u201cUhh?\u201d Right, he tends to forget that she doesn\u2019t get references such as these. One more reason why they don\u2019t get along swimmingly.\n\u201cX-men, Em.\u201d\nHer lips form a small \u2018o\u2019 and she nods heatedly. \u201cYes, now take a look for yourself!\u201d And then discreetly points out her newfound crush, standing on her tiptoes and craning her neck to see him better.\nWow, the guy certainly falls into the \u2018I want this man to be my baby daddy\u2019 category - he\u2019s crowded by girls and guys alike, as though he\u2019s a celebrity. The moment he turns around with a soft smile stretching his divine face, Lance realizes that he'd recognize that perfect jawline that just won\u2019t quit, even if all the lights suddenly flickered out.\nHis jaw almost drops to the floor and Em giggles something that sounds like \u2018Told you so\u2019\u00a0. But this isn\u2019t the reason why Lance has to figuratively pick up his unhinged jaw, oh no - rather, it\u2019s the fact that Takashi fucking Shirogane is standing before him in flesh and bone after a year of absolutely nothing.\nLance kind of wants to lie down on the ground and cry. He\u2019s never been more confused and overwhelmingly happy.\n\u201cI gotta go use the bathroom real quick,\u201d he breathes out, wide eyes still glued to Shiro\u2019s sturdy form. The older man looks like he hasn\u2019t changed one bit - it\u2019s hard to believe that he took three bullets to the side and wrestled with death -\u00a0and his smile is wide as ever.\n\u201cUgh, gross!\u201d his sis calls out, obviously mistaking it for something else. Since when did the little squirt develop a Lance-patented oversexualization filter?\nHe drops the bag in her small hands and races upstairs to find Allura.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease explain this!\u201d he begs once they\u2019re in the grand hall and the chatter is a little further away. Lance feels a little unnaturally hot under the collar.\nAllura seems infinitely confused, and is she faking it or does she truly not understand - doesn\u2019t have the slightest idea what he\u2019s on about. Seems like it\u2019s the latter. \u201cI told you that you might be interested in this year\u2019s events because my companion and I have decided to hold them on the same days, in the same building no less. We want the youth of our respective troupes to get to know different dance styles, learn to appreciate them, participate in the mutual training activities, and come out of this as good friends.\u201d\nThe woman drones on about the infinite benefits of the camp that Lance dislikes \u2013 he\u2019s a firm believer that dance camps and paid-for dance studios in general ruin individualistic creativity even if he can justify it in ballet, kind of \u2013 but he has to cut her short even if it seems rather rude. His heart\u2019s beating too fast for him to act like he\u2019s aware of social norms right now.\n\u201cNo, I meant the part where,\u201d He gestures upward. Allura\u2019s sapphire eyes follow the trajectory. \u201cWhere Shiro is participating here, and... Oh god,\u00a0is he the one in charge of the street kids?\u201d Lance\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cWait a second; is he that secret \u2018acquaintance\u2019 of yours? The same Shiro who is \u2013 was, damn it - a part of RB? And you never told us?\u201d\nAllura\u2019s eyebrows rise high up. \u201cWhat difference does it make? We\u2019re friends, and now, work colleagues. We\u2019ve never really talked about our achievements and backgrounds, we only wanted to practice in peace together!\u201d Her face flushes a deep raspberry, her hands curling into shaky fists. \u201cYou never asked and I never told you. You never told me anything, Lance, not even when I wanted to know why you stopped pursuing your dream!\u201d She\u2019s getting frustrated, he can see it. Her accent spills out more strongly when she\u2019s mad.\nLance brushes a hand over his face, unhappy. He doesn\u2019t like thinking about it, much less talking. He still remembers Allura, cautious and out of place with her white sundress and high heels, sitting on the baby grass next to him. Still remembers his lame attempts to counter those \u2018quit moping around\u2019 speeches with witty \u2018I\u2019m not moping around, I don\u2019t have a broom with me\u2019 replies. Needless to say, they all backfired.\nHe and Allura didn\u2019t talk for a while afterwards.\nHe has to wrap it up. With a sigh, he groans. \u201cSo you decided to have a mixer of two completely different styles and observe the outcome? Aren\u2019t you afraid that these kids will be at each other\u2019s throats before you can even start?\u201d Lance cautiously looks at the members of the same group who had given him the stink eyes, now openly glaring at the roaming ballet dancers, hostility rolling off in waves.\n\u201cYes, we want them to get to know each other, teach them mutual respect and the importance of cooperation.\u201d Allura glares down the bubbling insults on the street gang\u2019s kids' tongues before they can even surface. They look away in shame. \u201cAnd I think that if they truly want to stay here and work on their skills, they\u2019ll keep their mouths shut.\u201d\nLance is kind of envious of the way she holds herself like true royalty. Well, technically Allura is related to the royalty of some small country in southern Europe of which Lance\u2019s never heard of, but that\u2019s beside the point. \u201cSo like in \u2018Step Up\u2019?\u201d\nAllura shrugs. \"Now that you put it like that - yes. I guess it's just like in 'Step Up'.\"\n\u201cWith you and Shiro as the leads, I presume.\u201d He huffs, jealous, arms crossed over his chest. He doesn\u2019t have to look up to know that Shiro is looking down at them from the second floor as though he\u2019s worried that Lance is somehow harassing their precious ballet instructor.\n\u201cI \u2013 \u201d Allura begins, her mouth falling open and closing a couple of times. She looks like a fish pulled out of water, glancing up again. The smile that she sends Shiro's way - followed by a shy wave, eugh - is sickening, to say the least, and Lance still doesn't believe in dance camps. Obviously, this is some stupid elaborate ploy of two individuals with overactive imaginations and peace-seeking drives that's meant to fail eventually. Though the setup is strangely character-appropriate, especially for Shiro.\nAllura seemingly forgets what she wanted to say, as she reassures Shiro \u2013 with like one gesture, whoa \u2013 that everything\u2019s fine. \u201cLance, if he means so much to you, you\u2019re more than welcome to stay. I won\u2019t ask any payment of you, I just want to see you practicing again.\u201d Allura looks nostalgic somehow. Lance is almost tempted to humor her and stay the night just to make her feel better. Later on, he can tell her that he wasn\u2019t feeling it or simply couldn\u2019t stay. If he\u2019s going to let her down, he needs to do it gently.\nAfter all, seeing Shiro again brings out unwanted memories and secret needs that he has fought down repeatedly for a year.\nHe recoils when he notices that in his moment of spacing out, Allura had leaned in uncomfortably close, carefully studying his expressions with a funny look etched on her face. \u201cJeez, don\u2019t scare me like that!\u201d\nThe beautiful woman then crosses her arms, a small yet mischievous smile pulling at her lips. \u201cI think that I know the perfect way to restore your resolve and\u2026 convince you to give this a shot.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAllura drags him into one of the spacious training rooms. One of its walls is lined with mirrors bigger than Lance's future plans, and beautiful, arched windows take up the other side. It\u2019s already dark outside, so the forest-green satin curtains are pulled away, showing off the beautiful view of the city. The detailed marble columns are lined with piles of bags as people keep emerging from the dressing rooms. There\u2019s a whole lot of movement, some of the dancers already going over their routines of warming up or simply practicing in small groups. Lance thinks that, yeah, it\u2019s amazing and all, a sleepover and dancing, but this isn\u2019t enough to change his mind. That is until Allura pulls away the curtain off an arc that leads into the storage room. Lance thinks that, wow, it looks a whole lot different than the last time he\u2019s been here, playing hide and seek with Allura\u2019s ballet group at the Christmas afterparty. The entire McClain family, along with Hunk, had attended it to watch Em's performance - she was cast as one of the main leads in the play.\nNow that space is clear of soulless mannequins and brass instruments. The stools and tables have been pushed to the side and the low-hanging ceiling is entirely clear of cobwebs. Lance notices that this area is entirely ruled over by the older street dancers, with all of them stretching, dressed in sweats and loose-fitting clothes. Meanwhile, the ballet kids stand loiter around in the corners of the ex-storage room, their eyes filled with quiet admiration, too shy to join in just yet.\n\u201cMake sure to stretch properly before we get started,\u201d a stern voice calls out, and Lance nearly chokes on his spit.\nHis head almost gets whiplash at how fast he turns it to the side, only to find Keith there, looking over the students with his hands placed on his hips. The looks that he\u2019s getting from guys and girls alike are those of deep devotion and respect, worshipping the very ground that Keith walks on. Lance\u2019s cross-wired brain halts its crashing process for a second to wonder if this is how he looks whenever he watches Keith, too. Alas, the remains of his lucid thoughts are swept away by the wave of overwhelming emotions, blasting a garbled mess of Keith\u2019s name on repeat - Keith Keith Keith, Keith's here, he's real, and he is completely oblivious to Lance\u2019s presence, just like back in the good old days.\nHe looks a little tired. Thinner than Lance remembers him, the difference is easily noticeable because of the loose white crop top that the other is wearing. Keith's hips are still banging, though, even if he has the baggiest sweats known to mankind. Lance gulps nervously, fingers twitching for his phone. Pidge and Hunk are gonna freak out when they hear about this.\nThen he\u00a0remembers their last encounter, the bright paint and the proximity, and his brain functions cease altogether.\n\nOh right.\n\nLance\u00a0wants the black-haired man to look at him like that again, wants to see the indigo specks in those dark eyes, wants to \u2013\nAllura obscures Lance's vision as she sidles up to his massive fucking crush and looks over the students with a fond smile. \u201cLooking good. Is this your first shift?\u201d she wonders.\nKeith briefly glances her way, completely ignoring Lance openly gaping over her shoulder. His voice is nonplussed when he speaks up. \u201cThe second one. They\u2019re not bad, but some can\u2019t keep up.\u201d Ah yes, the 'holier-than-thou' attitude. How could he forget?\n\u201cYou\u2019ll whip them into shape, I\u2019m certain.\u201d Allura nods.\nKeith\u2019s lips curl up just the slightest bit. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea,\u201d he shrugs.\n\u201cShiro is very proud of you, Keith. I am, too.\u201d Allura continues to sweet talk and Lance knows her well enough by now to see where this is going and he is. Not. Ready!\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to live up to his expectations,\u201d the street dancer says in reply, ears turning a little pink at the tips. He finally seems more engaged in the conversation and faces them properly, crossing his arms over his chest. Lance tries not to do that thing that he does whenever he's in front of Keith - the thing where he repeatedly sneaks in glances at those sketched abs. He kind of wants to reach out and rub his paws all over the soft-looking muscle. When Lance looks up after the third, timed peek, he squawks inwardly, because Keith\u2019s looking right at him with a raised eyebrow. Caught in the act, good job.\nThey say that the third time\u2019s the charm, and he has somehow managed to fuck it up.\nLance\u2019s mouth is stretched into a long, flat line of need, when he tries very hard to not show any fear or discomfort as though he\u2019s facing off a panther. No matter how hard he tries, it still seems like Keith can smell the unease, ready to pounce and devour. However, in the end, it\u2019s Allura who sticks Lance out to the lion\u2019s den like the true friend that she is.\nShe pushes him out from behind herself to stand right in front of Keith. Lance\u2019s hands are an ocean of nervous sweat and he\u2019s visibly shaking \u2013 in fear or excitement, he doesn\u2019t know. Keith\u2019s gaze is steady, judging. Shit, he must be \"quite the sight\". Even Lance'd be turned off and he has the lowest standards out there.\nHe firmly rubs his moist palms against his baggy jeans, wondering if he\u2019s gonna bleach them with all that scrubbing and sweat. Allura introduces him, \u201cThis is my acquaintance. He\u2019s a very valued companion and I wish to entrust him to you to hone his fine dancing skills.\u201c She\u2019s flattering Lance beyond belief in that proud parent voice\u00a0of hers that she sometimes tunes in by accident, and Keith looks far more interested now. If Lance\u2019s heart beats any faster, he\u2019s going to die of heart failure. He also feels that if he opens his mouth he\u2019s going to throw up.\nAllura sends him a firm look that screams \u2018This is the part where you introduce yourself\u2019 and he immediately goes in for Keith\u2019s pale hand like it\u2019s a lifeline, shaking it furiously. \u201cI\u2019m McClance, I- I mean Lance. Lance McClain\u2019s the name.\u201d McClance? Really? He lets go of Keith\u2019s hand as though he's been burned and barely suppresses the urge to wipe it again, not wanting to seem disrespectful. Shit, it\u2019s all sweaty. Did he seriously touch Keith\u2019s hand with it? He touched Keith\u2019s hand! He held it! Now he kind of wants to do it again. He wants to hold those stupid, cool-skinned hands and do dumb things while they're at it, such as going on dates and stuff.\nKeith stares as though he\u2019s an enigma, violet eyes wider than usual, hand still hovering, frozen. \u201cUh, I\u2019m Keith\u2026\u201d he trails off and slowly lowers the hand. No recognition shines in his eyes whenever he looks at Lance, and he doesn\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good thing or not. The brunet feels as though he has a secret identity. Either that or Keith really couldn\u2019t care less about their last encounter. Maybe he flirts with everyone like that? Nah, he\u2019s too awkward, Lance can obviously see it.\n\u201cI know!\u201d he barks instead, voice cracking at the end. Keith raises those dumb, beautiful eyebrows again. \u201cI mean, I heard it while you were talking to Allura, duh, so, uh \u2013 \u201c Out of ideas as to what he should do to save himself from the impending public embarrassment, with Keith\u2019s self-proclaimed bodyguards eyeing him as though they\u2019re contemplating whether stabbing Lance with a blunt knife would be more painful than shooting him in the kneecaps, Lance fingerguns. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, and I\u2019m good. At dancing, I mean.\u201d Whoa, smooth like a piece of sandpaper currently dragged up and down his very much burning ass. Slowly.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s how he feels when Keith frowns.\nTheir distance shrinks, and is it appropriate to get flashbacks to Keith's colorfully painted face and that excuse for a shirt, so tight you could see every curve of those chiseled muscles? Because that\u2019s exactly what happens when they\u2019re almost nose-to-nose, and Keith grins mirthlessly in a challenge. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how good you are, Lance.\u201d\nLance would gladly give away half of his prized nerd lord merchandise for Keith to continue saying his name like that for the rest of their lives. Sadly, they only have five shitty days, and is Lance staying here? Hell yeah. He\u2019s staying in this camp even if it means sleeping on the floor tonight.\n\u201cSure,\u201d Lance hopes he sounds confident enough, and he probably does, because Keith backs off, not used to rude responses like that. Or maybe far too used to them. The glares of those around them intensify. Lance feels a shaky grin pulling at his lips. \u201cI could go all night, mullet boy,\u201d he says.\nSome girls gasp, indignant. Allura hisses a low \u2018Lance!\u2019 and he knows he's done goofed. A round of applause for Lance McClain and the three monkeys residing in his head that pilot his thought process, sex drive, and language, respectively. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s properly spoken to Keith and he's already managed to insult\u00a0the guy.\nIt\u2019s not his fault that Keith\u2019s presence alone is enough to make explosions erupt inside his brain and ribcage, and then turn him into a godawful, thirsty fuckboy. Except that it totally is, and fuck Keith, but also fuck Keith.\nAnd, of course, Keith wouldn\u2019t be Keith if he ever turned down a challenge, no matter how small.\nNot even Allura can save him now.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nGroup chat name: no zoinking allowed in pokego\n\n\n[11:21 pm] Group chat name changed to: pray 4 lance 2k16\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): guys\n\n\nholy fucking shit guess what\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): \u201cHoly fucking shit\u201c you didn\u2019t buy me the pizza rolls and disappeared?

He\u2019s beyond arrogant. Keith struts around like he\u2019s the hottest shit in charge \u2013 technically, he is, but Lance conveniently forgets that fact. He\u2019s positively insufferable and so incredibly kind to the more confused dancers who need to see another repeat of the move combinations that it makes Lance cringe.\nLance is jealous as hell, but he\u2019d never admit to that, not out loud. He only clenches his jaw and keeps going, his sweatshirt soaked through with sweat. Yikes.\n\u201cWould you mind teaching me how to shift my weight properly when we have to \u2013 \u201c A short girl with curly blond hair asks, and instead of trying to describe it, waves her hand in a \u2018screw it\u2019 gesture, clumsily going over the complex combination. She tries to bounce backward from her toes and into a light crouch, but the move looks so bad that the people behind her stifle laughter into their palms.\nLance would let out a guilty snort as well, but he knows exactly what she was aiming for, remembering his own ambitions that resulted in pulled muscles. He remembers looking idiotic, too.\nKeith lightly smiles, shooting the laughing bunch a nasty glare, a silent threat. He rolls up his oversized pants just so that the girl can see the movements of his legs. Lance drinks in the explanation, fingers twitching for his phone. Oh, it\u2019s coming, it\u2019s coming.\nOnce he\u2019s done, Keith rubs his palms together. \u201cAlright, it\u2019s rather simple. I showed you the shift, now carefully look at what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\u2018Oh, I\u2019m looking alright,' Lance thinks frantically, feeling like a sinner when he casually pulls out the device. He may feel like he\u2019s in heaven right now but he\u2019s definitely going to hell for this.\nKeith slowly goes over the motions. It\u2019s insane how he manages to balance himself so well when he has to keep the rather difficult poses for a prolonged period of time. Back in the day, Lance could barely hold himself upright while trying to pull them as fast as RB's members.\nHe slides backward with a light bounce. Lance bites his lower lip. \u201cSee what I\u2019m doing? Always keep your hands or elbows pressed into your legs.\u201d No no no, don\u2019t do that, I\u2019m calling the police, Lance screams internally when Keith digs the elbows into his thighs, spine dipping beautifully. \u201cIt all revolves around your sense of balance. If you\u2019re tilting forward, arch backwards. Shift the gravity center to your heels without removing your hands and then...\u201c He continues the easier part of the combination at a normal pace, spreading his legs in that fast rolling motion that makes the straightest of men noodle out. Keith smoothly adjusts the pose, jumping up, curling slightly to the left, and then locking. Lance mentally crosses himself and fiddles with the phone. \u201cGot it?\u201d\nLance counts only five people in the room who haven\u2019t gone completely red-faced.\nThe girl \u2013 her pale face now colored an interesting shade of magenta \u2013 nods, curt and obedient, and mimics Keith\u2019s little show. It\u2019s not perfect, her balance still wavers, but it looks way better than the previous attempt.\nLance quickly sends the four-second-long video to Pidge with the request to GIF IT.\nAnother hour passes, filled with \u2018C\u2019mon, McClain, I thought you were good at this?\u2019 and \u2018If you\u2019re getting too tired here, you can always drop out and go home\u2019, and then some retorts such as \u2018Oh, I\u2019m just getting started, Mullet\u2019, followed by \u2018Won\u2019t get rid of me that easily, are you scared that I\u2019m too much for you?\u2019. For all his cockiness, by the time the class is over, Lance feels as though he\u2019s dying \u2013 he\u2019s already forgotten what intense practice feels like. He whines to Em about the gross, cooling sweat until she takes pity and pulls off the old AC/DC hoodie, throwing it into Lance\u2019s overheated face. He\u2019d rather go through ten more sessions with Keith than sleep in sweaty clothes.\nThe cold shower works wonders against his flushed skin and Allura kindly offers one of the staff\u2019s towels. He crawls to the third floor where they\u2019re supposed to roll out the sleeping bags for the night, quickly stealing a beanbag chair for himself and dragging it to the unlit side room, far too unsettled to sleep near the street dance gang. Those guys kept eyeing him the entire night as though they were actually planning on shanking him in his sleep. Lance totally isn\u2019t too overdramatic.\nThankfully, there aren\u2019t any people around. Lance stretches out, muscles aching pleasantly. He missed these thrills. He then spends half an hour texting Hunk and trash-talking Keith in the group chat. Eventually, he dozes off.\nOverall, he\u2019s a light sleeper, the exceptions being the times when he doesn\u2019t get enough rest. Whenever his younger siblings have nightmares, they come to his room, seeking comfort. None of them want to bother Ma or Pa during their sacred rest hours, considering how hard they work to provide for them and keep their hectic household standing - that much the McClain siblings figure out at a very young age.\nSo needless to say, Lance rubs the crusty remains of sleep sand out of his eyes the second he feels something shifting close by. The city lights cast a pale orange glow on the man\u2019s skin. Lance blinks a few times, thinking that it\u2019s a rather vivid dream.\nKeith is digging through a duffel bag, shirt gone, mullet dripping steady rivulets down his sculpted back. Lance moans quietly, but it doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by Keith, who whips around with wide eyes.\nThey hold eye contact for a few seconds until Lance\u2019s brain gets some semblance of a signal in there. He murmurs something that could be translated into \u2018That you, Keith?\u2019 but sounds more like \u2018Fsddh uuuu, Kisth?\u2019. The aforementioned man turns back to whatever he's doing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re dreaming.\u201d He finally speaks to the sleepy brunet like an equal, tone devoid of arrogance, no sneering or glaring in sight. He appears to be calm. The atmosphere could be considered serene if not for the muted whispers coming from the other side of the heavy curtain separating the room from the main hall.\nLance stretches out his cramping legs and continues staring at his long-time idol with an endeared, sappy look as Keith pulls on a black tank top and checks his phone, hissing at the flash of light, squinting against its glare. It\u2019s weird to see Keith acting like a human being for once.\nA warm, strange feeling bubbles in Lance\u2019s chest, rising up his throat in the form of sleep-addled words. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re actually\u2026 not that bad. Plus, you\u2019re pretty,\u201d Lance yawns.\nKeith visibly stiffens up, lifting his gaze from the phone. \u201cUm, what?\u201d That same, startled look from when they first met overtakes Keith's handsome features.\nThe sound of his voice snaps Lance back to reality. With a shameful cough, Lance turns over in his makeshift bed and pulls the hood low over his head, neck blazing hot. \u201cI said you look shitty, goodnight!\u201d\nKeith\u2019s disgruntled \u2018Asshole\u2019 is barely audible, but after a second, he angrily bites back \"Goodnight to you, too!\"\nThe words are followed up by the sound of a curtain being pulled aside as the black-haired dancer leaves.\n\u00a0\nLance wakes up at 11:30 am.\nHis first thought is \u2018Where the hell am I\u2019, followed by \u2018I can\u2019t feel my neck\u2019, and then a resounding \u2018Oh shit\u2019.\nNow he\u2019s no genius or anything, but it doesn\u2019t take one to figure out that he has slept in.\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t have any time to do anything, jumping up from the dented beanbag and then sprinting downstairs, sweating buckets once he catches people staring at him weirdly, whispering. He nearly crashes through the curtains and his excuses are so loud that Keith is forced to stomp to the sound system to halt the music. The glares that his students shoot Lance's way aren\u2019t pretty.\n\u201cLook who has finally decided to join us,\u201d Keith crosses his arms. His hip juts out to the side. The shirt he\u2019s wearing is too damn tight, but Lance tries to stay focused. \u201cI was certain that you were back on your way home, McClain.\u201d\nLance's eyebrows knit together. \u201cThat\u2019d be way too easy for you.\u201d\nKeith tries to keep his chill attitude, but that eyebrow twitch is a dead giveaway. He stalks towards his unruly student, eyes squinted in a mute challenge. \u201cThink yourself quite the snarky chatterbox? \u201d\n\u201cSo glad that you noticed the finer details of my personality. It\u2019s like you have me cracked already.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I have you cracked alright, McClain.\u201d The crowd around them holds their breath, watching the fierce exchange. They probably want Lance gone, those asses. \u201cYou\u2019re a lazy brat who thinks that the world revolves around him. But let me tell you something - you\u2019re no star here. I\u2019m not some moon to your Earth \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cAre you trying to pick me up with romantic lines? I\u2019m almost sold. \u201c\nKeith stabs a finger into his chest. Ouch, that\u2019s gonna bruise. \u201cI\u2019m your fucking superior and you will treat me as such. If you couldn\u2019t hear like five alarms that I\u2019ve set for you-\u201c\nLance\u2019s eyes widen in surprise, genuinely touched. \u201cYou went out of your way to set an alarm for me?\u201d\nKeith chooses to ignore the question, cheeks tinged pink. He ends up stepping away, chin up. \u201cShow us what you've learned, McClain, and there\u2019s a small chance that I won\u2019t kick your sorry, flirty ass out.\u201d\n\u201cBut you do admit that we\u2019re flirting?\u201d\n\u201cNow!\u201d\n\u201cAlright, jeez! Don\u2019t yell, sheesh.\u201d Lance backs off, hands held up defensively.\nKeith continues huffing as he storms towards his plugged-in iPod. The brunet lazily goes over his warm-up stretches, watching Keith\u2019s butt all the while. He\u2019s wearing leggings today. Nice. \u201cYou know, you should get some sleep, too. You\u2019re really cranky. It's unhealthy.\u201d Keith ignores the comment, thumb shuffling through the playlist. \u201cAlso, you gotta stop trying to humiliate me in front of my sister.\u201d\nFrom the back, he hears Em yell \u201cGet rekt!\u201d\n\u201cLove you too, sugar!\u201d Lance groans.\nHe rises from the floor after a third push-up as the opening beats of \u2018Bubble butt\u2019 play. Fits his mood, honestly.\nLance isn\u2019t a huge fan of dancing to anything K-pop-related - or whatever mixture of music this even is - \u00a0but this is Keith\u2019s kingdom, his reign, so Lance is forced to obey his rules. The song is very jammy and his muscles are way looser than they were twelve hours ago, throwing him into the rhythm easily enough. He doesn\u2019t catch onto the fact that he is freestyling right until he executes a perfect air flip, some of Keith's students gasping in admiration, his sister cheering for him in the background and clapping wildly. Instead of walking backwards like he\u2019s supposed to during the finishing beats of the song, he takes a few bouncing steps towards Keith instead, dramatically mimicking his crossed arms-pose, hip jutting out.\nKeith\u2019s face is expressionless when he pauses the song and studies Lance\u2019s smug grin. \u201cWhen did I tell you to freestyle?\u201d\nThe brunet\u2019s grin falters.\nThe room goes deadly quiet.\nKeith pats his shoulder a few times, smirking. A mock consolation. \u201cCongratulations, McClain. Your sister\u2019s cheering saved your life. However,\u201cHe does not like the sound of that, \u201cFor pulling this crap and disobeying me, you might as well welcome yourself to hell. An hour of this routine should do the trick. Keep going until I deem you worthy enough of stopping.\u201d\nHe turns around on his heel. Lance wants to punch him in the face. \u201cYou can\u2019t just!\u201c he begins, indignant.\nThe demon instructor faces him with a lopsided smile. \u201cUh, I can and I just did. Have fun.\u201d\n\u2018Fucker.\u2019 Lance feels himself seethe beneath the surface as he glares daggers at the man's retreating back. He heaves a sigh. \u2018I hate seeing you leave like that, but I sure love watching you go.\u2019\nThe music resumes.\n\u00a0\n\nGroup chat name: dance camp shenanigans &amp; betting center\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): never mind\u00a0what i said bout keith hes satan and he needs an exorcism asap\n\n\nplease come here and exorcise him\n\n\nexercise him lol\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): \u00a0Somehow I knew that you\u2019d be begging us to save your ass one day into this ordeal.\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): have mercy\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): \u00a0Hmm......

DO YOU SEE IT. ITS FUCKING STUBBLE. S T U B B L E\n\n\nI CANNOT BE SEEN LIKE THIS I LOOK LIKE A HOBO WITH A 5\u2019OCLOCK SHADOW\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): \u00a0 I honestly didn\u2019t notice until you pointed it out? I didn\u2019t think you were capable of growing facial hair, seeing as you\u2019re like twelve in soul. I thought that your mindset affected your appearance somehow\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): yeah im twelve on a scale from one to ten also fuck you\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): Oh cmon lance you look good!! it actually suits you a lot\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): i look like a caveman bearbro\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson):\n If you want to see a true caveman, take a look at my legs, dude. I haven\u2019t shaved since like last Christmas. Now stop crying over every little thing. You won\u2019t die without your beauty bag.\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain) sent mounteverest.png\n\n\nUH HUH THEN TAKE A LOOK AT THIS\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): Uh what are we supposed to be looking at?\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): THIS. THE PIMPLE. I HAVENT HAD ONE SINCE I WAS SEVENTEEN.

He\u2019s soft and warm like mashed potatoes, not to mention breathtakingly beautiful. Lance can\u2019t wait to see what his and Allura\u2019s future children will look like. He can see the chemistry between them but they\u2019re obviously in that stage where they don\u2019t know that they like each other as more than friends, though they\u2019re beginning to realize it.\nShiro doesn\u2019t question Lance when he drags the tip of his sneaker across the surface of the fluffy Persian carpet and asks him for an autograph. For his little love-stricken sister, of course!\nShiro gives him two, winking playfully when Lance asks why. \u201cIt\u2019s better to have two in case you lose one,\u201d he explains.\nNeedless to say, he\u2019s happy that at least one of his idols fits the 'idol worth looking up to' description.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why Keith hates me so much.\u201d Lance groans, melting into the comfortable armchair of the staff room. The lingering scent of mint and mango tea makes him relax. He tries not to scratch at the pimple, far too self-conscious around Shiro, who radiates this \u2013 this divine energy. You just can\u2019t feel it from most of the pretty people out there.\nShiro sets down the cup of tea and blinks at him, long eyelashes fluttering. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hate you,\u201d he reassures with a small smile. \u201cHe\u2019s no good when it comes to socializing, so this alone is a challenge for him already. He\u2019s completely out of his comfort zone, please understand.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t give him the right to act like an asshole.\u201d\nShiro\u2019s grin turns painfully awkward, strained around the edges. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 headstrong to say the least, but he isn\u2019t a bad guy. I know that he sees talent in you. For sure.\u201d He nods sagely. Lance gets the feeling that Keith probably vented about him to the older man last night, but Shiro\u2019s trying very hard to contain himself and not blabber out Keith\u2019s private thoughts. \u201cGive it some time, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll work out.\u201d\nAllura, who\u2019s awfully quiet, only listening to them talk and blatantly mooning over Shiro, pats away the remains of sugar from her lips. \u201cLance, you know fully well that you have some discipline-related issues. You cannot blame this all on Keith.\u201d\nLance gasps and grabs his chest. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re taking his side! After forcing me to do the same routine for almost three hours just because I slept in, I \u2013\u201c\n\u201cWait,\u201d Shiro interrupts, eyebrows furrowed. \u201cHe made you do that?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Lance yells out in frustration and throws his arms in the air, grabbing his short brown hair. The strands are no longer as soft now that he hasn\u2019t seen his overpriced conditioner for two whole days. \u201cHe\u2019s a slave driver, and you\u2019re trying to tell me that it\u2019s fine! I\u2019m certain that this is a huge violation of my rights!\u201c\nLance shuts up when he catches a glimpse of Shiro\u2019s smile, carefully covered by the rim of the ceramic cup. \u201cWell, Lance, I guess you have something to look forward to!\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the sweet release of death, because that\u2019s the only thing I want the most right now!\u201d\nAllura\u2019s sapphire eyes study Shiro\u2019s strange expression until they twinkle in understanding, her painted mouth forming an \u2018o\u2019. Lance feels completely thrown off by their reactions. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nAllura rises, the shiny spandex of her leotard gleaming. Shiro looks aside, flushing.\n\u201cBack to practice!\u201d she commands before the brunet can open his mouth to protest. She almost shoves him through the door, trying to encourage him all the while. \u201cWork hard and trust me, the results will be worth it!\u201d\nLance nearly falls over. \u201cYou know, if you and Shiro just wanted a moment for yourselves to make smoochy faces at each other, you could\u2019ve just asked me to-\u201c\nThe door gets slammed into his face.\n\u201c\u2026Leave.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, again. Right, left, bounce twice on it with your toes, toes! Okay, stop!\u201d Keith waves a hand and some kind soul halts the song. Lance feels more in his element now that he\u2019s dancing to one of his goddesses \u2013 Rihanna.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong now?\u201d Lance groans, standing up. He\u2019s legitimately aching and just wants that evening break to come sooner before he collapses or has to run to the bathroom to throw up the curd puffs he had for lunch.\nKeith\u2019s hair is tied back in a messy ponytail, the back of his neck gleaming with sweat. He stalks to Lance and leans in, hands on hips, eyes scanning. \u201cThe slow robo shift, c'mon. Do it again.\u201d\nLance sighs at the lack of music and the overabundance of scrutinizing stares all around, and dips his body weight low while swinging his arm before himself at chest height, bent at elbow to make the move more precise, \"laggy\". His upper body flows like water as he takes the stupid right, left, right, left, followed by the dumb bounce before Keith decides to yank at the material of his pants until only the tip of Lance\u2019s sneaker is touching the ground. He almost stumbles forward because of the sudden action.\n\u201cI told you on toes,\u201d Keith says slowly as though his student is a petulant child, eyebrows furrowed. He is glaring at Lance\u2019s leg as though he\u2019s having some sort of epiphany. Lance really wants to scream. \u201cIt has to be a bouncing step, not some awkward tap-dance to the beat of the hottest polka hits. And then you have to kick out. \u201c\nKeith repeats the motion flawlessly, bringing his right leg \u2013 again with the fucking toes, Jesus, he should be downstairs teaching ballet - in a perfect semi-circle, and then kicking it out twice, powerful.\nLance tries again. Keith\u2019s eyebrow twitches like watching the brunet dance is causing him physical anguish. He rubs at his face, exasperated. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working out,\u201d he sighs. \u201dYou have an enviable amount of control in your upper body that even I can\u2019t compare to.\u201d\nLance\u2019s jaw drops. People around them start whispering. He rubs at his tired eyes \u2013 did he hear this right? Keith\u2019s dishing out compliments? Where's Ashton Kutcher yelling out 'Punk'd'? Of course, all good things must come to an end.\n\u201cHowever, I\u2019m not sure how your upper body is going to pull you through when your legs aren\u2019t listening to you at all. You\u2019re like,\u201d Keith kicks air randomly and some people start sniggering. \u201cI don\u2019t know, aiming to be the soccer champion here? You can\u2019t do that, the movement needs to be precise. And most of it needs to come from your hips, which, by the way, you aren\u2019t using. At all.\u201d\nLance actually gets offended by it. \u201cExcuse me!? I\u2019ll have you know that I have the best hips out there, and while I may not be Shakira\u2013\u201c\n\u201cGet over here, McClain,\u201d Keith interrupts his self-absorbed rant, pulling him in by the sleeve of the humid hoodie. If this keeps up, it\u2019s going to develop its own ecosystem. God, where are Pidge and Hunk!? Lance lets out a surprised squeak when Keith holds him by the shoulders, and turns him around so that he\u2019s facing the mirror wall. His face is wet, red from exertion and the sudden physical contact.\nFor a second, he meets Keith\u2019s beautiful indigo eyes in the mirror's reflection, but then the black-haired man looks down and Lance feels a sneaker pushing his feet apart. He allows Keith to do it, feeling very warm all of a sudden.\nIt doesn\u2019t prepare him for what comes next, though. Lance feels himself dying a little on the inside. And outside, too, probably.\nHis face explodes in shades of maroon when Keith nudges his thighs apart with a knee and doesn\u2019t remove the leg, keeping it locked in place. That attractive voice is no more than a whisper of breath against the sensitive shell of Lance\u2019s burning ear. \u201cTell me, Lance, have you danced at clubs before?\u201d\nLance makes a strangled gargle that could be translated into \u2018Yessir\u2019.\n\u201cSo this should be familiar to you.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s fingers are five distinctive points of fire on Lance\u2019s lower back. The brunet sucks in a shaky breath and prays to god almighty for strength to not pop a stiffy in front of everyone. The students are far too amused to look away from the intertwined pair.\n\u201cSpread your legs, get down lower, and lean forward!\u201d Keith commands.\nLance closes his eyes for three seconds, taking in a shaky inhale.\nHe does as told, forcing himself to grin smugly. \u201cI never knew you were a kinky exhibitionist.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s fingers dig into his back in warning. \u201cGrind downwards, you horrible shithead.\u201d\n\u201cNow you wanna see how fine my grinding is? Really? What teaching method is that? Buy me dinner first,\u201d Lance babbles nervously and tries to do just that, channeling his hip game, thankful that Keith\u2019s knee is at least a few inches away from a certain area.\nHe presses his upper back against Keith's front just to live up to the shithead title, pushing back on his fingers. He then throws a curious look over his shoulder, dying to know how this action has affected the other, only to find Keith staring back with wide eyes like he didn\u2019t even consider the idea of Lance actually doing something like this, playing along with this crap. Lance bites down on his lower lip at their proximity as Keith shakes his head to the sides. He tries to free the leg, but Lance only clamps his thighs around it, firmly locking it in place.\n\u201cHow was that, Mullet?\u201d\nKeith, for once, has nothing sassy to say.\n\u201cGet a room!\u201d Em yells and there\u2019s a flash of a camera.\n\u00a0\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): \u00a0No monkey business until we arrive with a pack of condoms, jeez. Lance, keep your dick on a leash.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLance spends the considerably short break getting shit for grinding with the instructor in public and handling a whole lot of thirsty teens asking him for advice, extremely impressed by the small show.\nHe befriends a tall girl named Shay, the only person out here who looks at him with complete kindness rather than burning jealousy or hatred. She\u2019s almost a head taller than Lance and probably has bigger guns than his and Pidge's combined, but her tanned face is soft and cute.\n\u201cI heard that at the end of day five, the camp\u2019s chosen ones will perform,\u201d she says, handing Lance her water bottle. He gratefully accepts it and dumps it over his naked torso. He\u2019s gross as hell already, might as well. \u201cSix solo performances by the people from ballet and street dance studios respectively, then three mixed performances. \u201c\nEm strolls up to them, ramming herself into his back to show affection. \u201cThe combined performances are the shit! I hear that you\u2019ll get to dance with Shiro! They\u2019ll film it and post it on RB\u2019s old YouTube account! Isn\u2019t that great!? Obviously, I\u2019m aiming for that.\u201d Internet fame and glory, huh? Not bad.\nShay folds her arms to hug herself, looking sad. \u201cI don\u2019t think that this rumor is true. Shiro\u2019s\u2026 completely out of commission. He\u2019s more of an adviser and choreographer rather than an instructor. Some of the more difficult moves that require a lot of upper body strength have to be performed by Keith in his stead.\u201d Her amber eyes drift to the ex-RB duo. Shiro rubs at the spandex-covered, injured arm while Keith watches the careful movement with hawk-like intensity, gaze filled with worry.\nLance observes Shiro showing Keith some moves, talking through every shift, the older man's face twisting up in discomfort the moment he has to do that throwback with arms. It makes Lance wince. Keith\u2019s immediately on him, frantically waving around. The older dancer looks ashamed by the scolding.\nThe reality finally hits Lance in full force.\n\u201cHe really is out of commission, huh?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKeith finds Lance playing the stupid Rihanna song that always leaves him feeling confused by the raging emotions that he feels, practicing the kicking motion in earnest.\nHe lingers in the entryway, fully leaning against the graceful arch as he watches his pupil with a fond smile tugging on his lips, right until Lance\u2019s gaze drifts to the mirror. He stops dancing, panting heavily, the beats of 'Needed Me' loud in the background.\nKeith tries to appear casual as he walks into the room, taking small, bouncy steps, hands clasped behind his lower back. He tries not to let his gaze wander in the general direction of Lance\u2019s abs, tight from the blood rush, rippling beneath the dark, sweaty skin with every inhale of breath.\n\u201cYou\u2019re no longer aiming for FIFA.\u201d Keith attempts to break the ice.\nLance towels his face, hiding the faint blush in the soft material, close to screaming into it at the happy feeling that overtakes him. \u201cThere goes my childhood dream then.\u201d\nKeith rocks back and forth, shifting from toes to heels. \u201cI don\u2019t know about childhood dreams, but I don\u2019t think you would\u2019ve made a decent soccer player either way. You got that dancer\u2019s kick ingrained into you. Just had to extract it somehow. Keep, uh, keep working on your hips, too.\u201d Keith\u2019s embarrassed stutter doesn\u2019t slip by Lance completely unnoticed. He feels a genuine smile playing on his lips.\nKeith turns away immediately, cheeks flushed a dark red. He coughs into a fist and sidles up to Lance, readjusting the material of those black leggings in embarrassment. \u201cOkay, so\u2026 you just - ugh, this is gonna look like some kickboxing regime, but it helps.\u201c\nHis demonstration is soft. The way he kicks out uses so much hip game that Lance instantly gets flashbacks to that Halloween party. \u201cYou just, uh. Softly, you know. Bounce, shimmy, kick. Not like you\u2019re kicking around a man who\u2019s already down.\u201d He then swings the leg in a sharp, small arc.\nLance feels a laugh bubbling from his throat. \u201cYou'd know what that feels like, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\nKeith squints, confused, shrugging it off. Lance takes that as a silent command for him to do the same. He copies the move with a playful bounce to his step. Keith\u2019s eyes brighten. \u201cGood. Softer, though. Like your own child.\u201d\nNow Lance really does start cracking up. He clutches at his naked chest, laughing until tears well up in his eyes.\nKeith stands there frozen, nothing short of a deer caught in headlights. \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2026 the right way to use this one. Um.\u201d\n\u201cN-No\u2026\u201d Lance wheezes. \u201cBaby kicker.\u201d\nHe starts howling again, only to get startled by the soft snort coming from his side. He looks up, completely mesmerized, when he hears Keith expressing actual glee. Actual poison-free joy over a dumb use of a metaphor.\nKeith snickers softly and punches Lance's shoulder lightly. \u201cAlright, alright, I get it.\" He holds back a fresh wave of laughter, a beautiful grin stretching his face. Lance smiles back until his cheeks hurt as he memorizes the position of the dimples on Keith\u2019s cheeks, the flash of perfect teeth. \u201cA silly thing to say.\u201d The instructor rams his side into Lance. \u201cGo back to practicing, you prick.\u201d\n\u201cAww, that\u2019s the nicest name you\u2019ve called me today.\u201d\nKeith shrugs, making his way towards the exit. \u201cDon\u2019t let it get to your head too much, McClain.\u201d\nOuch. But hey, Lance loves a good challenge and Keith is by far the most interesting one.\nLance\u2019s first sexuality crisis happened all the way back in his junior year of high school.\nHe was known as the Ladies Man, the Beast in Bed, the guy your mother warned you about and your father pushed out of range with a long broomstick. Lance had the looks and the game, and whenever those failed, well, he had the sick guitar skills. The ladies sure appreciated a boy who knew how to play. It was super romantic whenever he played under their windows late at night or something like that. He honestly never fully grasped this concept in particular.\nYet when he had his first\u2026 thoughts about the guys around him, he wasn\u2019t really all that shocked. Not as surprised as he thought he\u2019d be, really. It was almost disappointing.\nWhen a guy from his parallel class pulled Lance into the bathroom stall \u2013 they were talking about something beforehand, but for the life of him, Lance couldn\u2019t remember what it was about \u2013 he was almost excited. At that point, he'd had a fair share of stall adventures but never with another dude, and that alone made his heart beat faster with everything but fear. He was so ready to give his first BJ - or receive one, it didn\u2019t matter, the guy was really damn beautiful even if he looked like one of those bass-playing emo stoners \u2013 that he almost whined in overwhelming sadness when the guy only pulled out a folded piece of paper containing the answers of their upcoming physics test and asked if he was interested in buying it.\nWow, way to leave a guy hanging.\nLance emerged from that bathroom as a brand new man and when he told Hunk about it, his friend merely shrugged, and they continued talking about their history project like nothing happened.\nWhen Lance first meets Keith officially, he somehow knows for sure that the other won\u2019t really care if he decides to pull some choice moves on him. Keith seems just like his best friend in that aspect, uncaring of social norms, desensitized, and completely immune to the finer aspects of Lance\u2019s flirting.\nA few minutes into their one-on-one routine practice, Lance knows that he can get away with shameless flirting, and \u2018accidental\u2019 physical contact. Keith only rolls his eyes at the lame pickup lines and continues teaching him like ten variations of a smooth slide-out and overly complicated locking. The black-haired man doesn\u2019t bristle as much as he did on the first day of the camp, sometimes dropping incredibly sarcastic remarks \u2013 \u201cIf you have the time to run your mouth, you have the time to learn these moves, faster, McClain\u201d \u2013 but he makes no move to pull out the sound system\u2019s cords to strangle Lance with them.\nThat knowledge leaves the brunet\u2019s blood pumping and mind reeling, coming up with all those smooth one-liners, all while working up a fine layer of sweat and trying not to die. Exploring what makes Keith tick is the fun part.\nComments regarding the instructor\u2019s appearance don\u2019t seem to be affecting him at all. Whenever Lance so much as insinuates that Keith has thighs meant to crush a man\u2019s skull, the other writes him off as another mouthy fuckboy who\u2019s all about talking big and speeds up his movements just to spite him. Lance can keep up, sure, but he\u2019s still lacking.\n(Keith\u2019s eyes don\u2019t miss the fact that Lance is getting better and faster with every repeat.)\nKeith snorts when the brunet fucks up a rushed slide-out and throws a smug \"Again\" over a naked shoulder, eyelashes fluttering innocently. Lance sticks out his tongue at that and turns his attention back to the mirror to observe the instructor\u2019s fluid movements, the beats of \u2018Needed Me\u2019 too far away.\nThey have a stare-off, gazes glued to the reflective surface. Honestly, if they were looking at each other directly right about now, Lance suspects that there\u2019d be a whole lot more eye sex involved. Keith commands him to get into position, this time to dance to the song from the very beginning. Damn, Lance sure loves that bossy side of him. In certain situations, of course.\nKeith slowly makes his way to the brunet, taking his sweet time, eyes shining a fierce indigo. Lance, being himself, decides to be an asshole and instantly copies the other\u2019s walk until they circle each other. He feels confident in his stride, a shit-eating grin tugging at his lips. Keith\u2019s eyes glimmer at the sight of it, accepting the silent challenge.\n\u201cShow me what you got, McClain.\u201d\n\u201cGet ready to be floored!\u201d Lance winks playfully and it feels almost too familiar, the teasing and the not-quite smile on Keith\u2019s face.\nKeith still keeps a close eye on Lance\u2019s movements reflected in the mirrors, guiding him with a stern voice whenever he loosens up too much and messes up something basic.\nIt isn\u2019t Lance\u2019s fault that the material of Keith\u2019s pants is tight enough around his ass to grab his attention like that. This would be so much easier if he chose to wear the baggy sweats today too. His blue eyes are completely stuck on the alluring curves of Keith\u2019s killer hips when he swiftly steps back and the arm that he throws back to match the movement at that delicious \u2018boom boom\u2019 nearly smacking into Lance\u2019s thigh.\nThere\u2019s supposed to be more distance between them, right?\n\u201cEyes where I can see them.\u201d Keith huffs, eyebrows furrowed, not stopping for a second and perfectly stepping into the beat.\nLance's gaze drifts back to the mirrors, taking notice of the light pink flush on that pale face that has very little to do with exertion, considering that Keith\u2019s completely immune to getting tired. It\u2019s like he\u2019s a programmed robot, ready to produce sick moves on command.\nA wicked idea surfaces in his head.\nIn case he\u2019s going to end up choked with cables, at least he\u2019s going to go out smiling, whispering \u2018Worth it\u2019.\n\u201cPull once. Don\u2019t forget to step out on time or you\u2019ll miss the beat, then down, down, roll your elbow nicely and try to lower it sensually so it flows smoother, end the transition on \u2018Give it to ya\u2019.\u201c Keith narrates, sounding just a little winded.\nIt\u2019s the perfect moment to put his plan into motion.\nRight as his goddess, Rihanna, croons a perfect baby, Lance wraps up the last move, lowering his arm and taking a few steps towards Keith, right until he can almost feel the heat radiating off the other\u2019s back.\nHis instructor's movements turn laggy from surprise as Lance continues the motion purely based on memory, staring at the back of that pretty neck flushing a cute pink.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to do that.\u201c Keith hisses, always the one anal about precision in his routines, yet he still pushes his butt out into that sensual roll. Lance barely has the time to copy the movement, but Keith still manages to step on his toes. Any contact down there would spell his untimely downfall and Lance is not about to have the walk of shame this early in the evening.\nThe instructor stops the moment Lance\u2019s fingers brush over the pale skin of his hand placed at the hip. The music continues. Keith knows that trying to catch up would be a wasted effort.\nHe looks over his shoulder, annoyance and something else entirely written all over his face, visible in the stiffness of his body. Indigo eyes flicker to Lance\u2019s lingering hand, then back to the taller man's stupidly attractive face. Subconsciously, he repeats the actionbut then forces himself to stop at the sight of Lance\u2019s triumphant grin. His student looks like he's having a field day.\n\u201cWhat the hell are you-\u201c Keith thanks every deity out there for making his voice come out sharp rather than all stuttery and weak, which is what he feels like on the inside.\nKeith can feel Lance supposedly discreetly brushing a thumb against the material of his black leggings. He bites on the inside of his cheek to stop himself from inhaling sharply. There are a few inches of space between their noses at most.\n\u201cSorry, sorry, reflex!\u201d Lance laughs, strained. Having the black-haired man so close is doing funny things to his chest. There goes \u2018Operation: Smooth sexy approach\u2019. Keith squints\u00a0those pretty eyes, seemingly dumbstruck. \u201cHow am I not supposed to place\u00a0my hands on pretty curves when they\u2019re right in front of me?\u201d\nSomething weird happens to his voice as it cracks and then lowers. Lance almost feels embarrassed, but then he sees the sudden shift in Keith\u2019s expression. Somehow, it\u2019s not what he expects.\nThe instructor's eyes are blown wide with surprise, eyebrows slightly pinched. His mouth hangs open as though he\u2019s just realized something important.\nLance feels his palms beginning to sweat, followed by a pang of strange fear in his gut.\n\u201cWh-what?\u201d he manages to grind out.\nKeith shakes his head to the sides, blinking rapidly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s...\u201c Keith begins, hand hovering near Lance\u2019s face before dropping. The former man twists his body in a sharp turn, elbowing Lance in the stomach just enough to leave him curled up. He uses the momentum to quickly back away.\nGod damn it, if this is how he treats every single person who pulls moves on his sorry, dense ass, then is it really worth the effort?\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Lance winces, dramatically crumbling to the floor and curling up.\nHe can hear Keith\u2019s rushed steps, but they\u2019re not getting any closer to check on the fallen man and possibly cradle him in his arms. In fact, it seems that the other is leaving the room.\n\u201cWalk it off,\u201d Keith quips, voice full of forced calm. \u201cTen-minute break.\u201d\nOnce the brunet knows that he\u2019s alone, Lance quits his Oscar-worthy performance of a dying man in desperate need of TLC and rubs at the aching bruise on his ribs, confused.\n\u201cWhat the hell is his problem, sheesh.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Keith finds himself repeatedly shaken by the most bizarre and intense sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\u00a0\nBreak time is a relief, Lance decides, as he sidles up to Em, short wet hair sticking out in every direction and smelling of extremely cheap soap. Despite being a fancy school, they sure could not afford basic necessities. The black sweatpants that Shiro had lent him hang a little too low on his waist for comfort. Lance prays for his friends to get there faster. He doesn't want to accidentally flash everyone, and he\u2019d rather not think about the fact that he\u2019s practically swimming in Shiro\u2019s sweats while completely commando. These past few days have been insane, to say the least. One moment he\u2019s foaming at mouth over RB, and the next he\u2019s standing with his idol\u2019s pants pressed against his chest, trying not to whimper in gratitude.\nEm tries to talk him into keeping the pants forever so that she can sleep with them wrapped around her head or whatever,\u00a0but immediately backs off when Lance mentions the underwear fact.\nSpeaking of RB\u2026\nThere\u2019s a group of youngsters gathered around the McClain siblings as they go over old RB videos, all of them that Lance knows by heart. Some kids comment on how their movements have gotten way better in the videos taken after their first tournament, with the duo radiating more power and confidence. Em decides to drool over Shiro while Lance stares at Keith\u2019s slim figure, oversized shirts doing nothing to cover up his beautiful movements. He thanks god that the black-haired man has swapped his hanging shirts for hanging crop tops.\nAs he keeps watching, he feels some weird, overwhelming affection worm its way into his heart, and while Lance used to, uh, observe their vids at 3 am \u2013 he has that one Keith-exclusive dance choreography of \u2018Say my name\u2019 ingrained into the core of his being, it\u2019s Lance\u2019s religion and beliefs combined into one, and he had begged his friends to bury him with a copy of it more than enough times \u2013 he never felt anything like this.\nGetting to know the real Keith is a wild ride that he appreciates, even if it leaves his head spinning afterwards.\nSomehow, Em ends up at the K-pop dance covers part of YouTube, and a discussion breaks out, spreading like wildfire, dragging in more and more people into it, extracting various opinions.\n\u201cIf you think that it\u2019s easy, Lance, try putting on my pointes and then freestyle to the fastest song out there all the while standing on your toes!\u201d Em yells passionately, brown eyes full of arrogance. She\u2019s provoking a good old one-on-one banter. He tries to dismiss it, considering that they always end up clashing too much, sometimes to the point they end up not talking to each other for weeks. They aren\u2019t home right now, so they need to keep it low-key.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t dancing,\u201d Lance firmly says and waves at the six cute girls on the screen, hopping around to some cheerful Korean song with seemingly minimum effort and movement. \u201cMaybe if they took off those torture devices, it\u2019d be something close to goddamn effort.\u201d\n\u201cTry it first and then say that it takes no effort!\u201d\n\u201cUh huh, not gonna happen. And I still stand by the fact that this is by no means dancing. I could do it, too.\u201d Lance crosses his arms over his chest and leans back, ignoring Em\u2019s puffed-up chest, swelling with a rant about his opinions being dumb and close-minded, or something along those lines.\nShe doesn\u2019t get to voice it out, though, because there\u2019s a familiar voice behind him. \u201cThen go for it. If you think that those girls have it easy, show us how it\u2019s done.\u201d Keith mimics his pose, obviously on the supporting side, ready to throw down if needed.\nLance merely rolls his eyes. \u201cYou sure sound confident for someone who\u2019d fall the moment you put those on.\u201d\n\u201cTragic experience talking?\u201d\n\u201cTry me, pretty boy.\u201d Lance spreads his arms, gesturing vaguely. \u201cHop around in heels for me, c\u2019mon.\u201d\nKeith takes in a sharp breath, seriously offended. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that I couldn\u2019t do it?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not only saying, I\u2019m stating.\u201d Lance blows a raspberry. This can go two ways and he can clearly see which path they\u2019re taking. He knows that he\u2019s pushing Keith\u2019s buttons in all the wrong places. Perhaps he\u2019s driven by curiosity and the challenge, never one to miss an opportunity like this. \u201cI\u2019m also stating that this isn\u2019t dancing.\u201d\nKeith glowers at him. Em has half a mind to back away from the war zone on time. \u201cAnd I\u2019m stating that you\u2019re about to eat your words, McClain,\u201d he hisses as his eyes sweep over the crowd. Everyone\u2019s attention is now focused on the bantering duo as though they\u2019re the dinner entertainment of the century.\nLance is ready to show them true entertainment.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Mullet, impress me. Prove me wrong, oh great guardian of not-an-art-form.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s grin is deadly. \u201cIf I fucking slay on that dancefloor, you better show me a satisfactory performance. One-up me, McClain.\u201d\nLance feels cool sweat breaking out on his neck at the flash of sharp canines. He feels himself cornered, but it\u2019s going to be worth it in the long run. Worth the embarrassment. Then again, he\u2019s pretty certain that he could still somehow manage to dance in heels. He did that once on a dare a long, long time ago, and it wasn\u2019t even hip-hop-related. Now that he thinks about it, that couldn\u2019t even be considered \u2018dancing\u2019.\nLance\u2019s ass is grass and he has unknowingly given Keith the mower.\nHe helplessly watches the instructor seek out Allura. She reluctantly gives him her black boots, their heel no thicker than a pencil. Knowing Allura, those shoes probably cost more than Lance\u2019s house.\n\u201cHave fun kissing the ground!\u201d Lance calls out in a last-ditch effort to seem confident, excitement thrumming in his veins.\nKeith flips him off and gets surrounded by his students while putting on the toothpick heels.\n\u201cHe\u2019s so easy to provoke,\u201d Lance breathes out almost fondly, even though he feels his ass nearly roasting over the bonfire that Keith has built. His body flushes at the thought of what\u2019s about to happen, drowning out the uneasiness.\n\u201cYour ass is toast, though, and you know it,\u201d Em says just to be a little shit, and fucks up his good vibes instantaneously.\n\u201cPft yeah right, I\u2019ll prove that it\u2019s nothing.\u201d He\u2019s trying to convince himself at this point.\n\u201cWhatever lets you sleep better at night, bro.\u201d His sister examines the ends of her thick braid, nonchalant. \u201cJust so you know, rumor has it that Keith is a pro at dancing with heels. Then again, it might be just a rumor. Perhaps you won\u2019t embarrass yourself too much.\u201d\nLance feels his guts freeze over and his heartbeat halt. \u201cWhat?\u201d he blurts out right as some guy yells \u2018Give it up for Keith!\u2019 and, of course, Jason Derulo\u2019s \u2018Wiggle\u2019 starts playing.\nKeith pulls his hair into a loose bun, all while strutting to the middle of the room, stride confident. Unwavering. Lance chokes a little. \u201cWell, he can certainly walk in them, but doesn\u2019t mean that-\u201c His mouth is so fucking dry.\nKeith\u2019s movements aren\u2019t restricted whatsoever, as though he\u2019s wearing the world\u2019s most comfortable kicks and his heels aren\u2019t six inches away from solid ground.\nLance grabs at his heart when Keith does The Sexy Squat \u2013 he needs a trademark somewhere in there \u2013 and lowers his head. Em has taken up the recording duty along with half of the people around them.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d Lance whimpers like a wounded dog, face flushed and pride damaged.\n\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d\nKeith falls on the ground, gracefully catching himself with strong arms, spine dipping in a sensual full-body roll.\n\u2018Hot dang it, your booty is too banging\u2019, indeed.\nLance whines, tells Em to call 911, asks her to tell Ma that he loves her, tell Pidge to delete his internet history and burn his mag collection, and that he wants a headstone that says \u2018Don\u2019t challenge pretty boys to dance-offs\u2019.\nThe final drop that Keith executes leaves the crowd roaring with praise. Lance shakes from the sheer pressure building up in his throat and belly. Keith carefully peels off Allura\u2019s shoes, not a single scratch on their pristine surface, and waves them in Lance\u2019s face.\n\u201cAnything else you want on your headstone?\u201d Em asks when he runs a hand through his messy hair, flattening it.\n\u201c\u2019I had a horrible sister\u2019 will suffice.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTime out, time out, this is bullshit! You\u2019re cheating. It\u2019s your Korean blood! Korean blood, I say!\u201d Lance squeaks and almost falls for the third time, legs shaking as though he is a newborn gazelle ready to explore the joys of the African savanna.\nPlot twist: the gazelle gets devoured by a goddamn panther before it can so much as take a single step, the panther being Keith.\nShay, thankfully, holds him up with one strong arm wrapped around his waist, eyebrows furrowed in worry, disapproving of the snickers of those around.\nKeith quirks an eyebrow at that. \u201cAnd do tell me, how do you know that fact?\u201d\n\u201cUh. Shiro told me.\u201d\u2018Smooth, Lance, very smooth. Sure, put Shiro out for roasting like that. It\u2019s not like Keith can ask him about that at any given moment. Jesus Christ, Pidge was actually right. I\u2019m a goddamn idiot.\u2018\nIt\u2019s still better than the truth, something along the lines of \u2018Oh you know, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve spent the past god knows how many years drooling over your dance vids and actively stalking you on Twitter, retweeting all of your rants about conspiracy theories and politics along with countless blurry pics of Shiro smiling before tournaments. Oh, and then I told all of this to my local pastor, no hard feelings, right? It was an accident. Also, you\u2019re by far the most interesting person I\u2019ve ever met and I want to know everything about you, but your mullet is still stupid, so there\u2019s that.\u2019\n\u201cThis is fucking bullshit!\u201d Lance yells again, frustrated, and takes off Allura\u2019s shoes before she can charge him with three million dollars for scratching up her Louis Vuitton.\nKeith looks at him with smug satisfaction, point proven. He\u2019s unlike Pidge in that aspect, seemingly never getting bored of Lance making an idiot out of himself in public.\n\u00a0\n\nGroup chat name: dance camp shenanigans &amp; betting center\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain) sent jesuswonthelpusnow.mov\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): I cant believe he actually did it??? :o this is some mad skill though, i wish i could execute that worm drop in such perfection while wearing heels\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): please dont ignore my wounded pride\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): I\u2019m sorry man but it\u2019s been slain :(\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): it died a beautiful death not gonna lie\n\n\nbtw i think em is a keith-girl now. its like having a boy band and then everyone picks favorites\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): Ohh, like Pidge is a shiro fan, youre a total keith-boy and im that five percent in it for the cool dance tricks\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): youre a total shiro-boy dont you lie to me\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): How did it feel having\u00a0your ass handed to you yet again, brother?\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): the same way it\u2019ll feel when you give me those 10 dollars that you just lost\n\n\nits ok pidgey we must all taste defeat someday\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): Do you want the rainbow boxers with unicorns and nyan cats or those small lacy panties that I just found under your bed?\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): have mercy\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): Too late.\n\n\u00a0\nPidge gets their ass to the dance camp half an hour later. Keith even graces Lance with a small break.\nPidge scrunches up their nose when the exhausted brunet attempts to drape himself all over their small frame.\n\u201cGive me your life force, gremlin,\u201d Lance hisses in lieu of a proper greeting and gets elbowed in the ribs.\n\u201cYou stink, dude. How are you supposed to get the babes when you smell like an old moldy sock? Go wash up, you dirty boy.\u201d Pidge brings back the chat memes right on queue like the good bro they are. Lance instantly feels better, straightening up his aching back.\n\u201cThey got this weird ass herb soap and \u2013 hey! I smell like a bed of roses!\u201d The brunet gasps, grabbing at his chest at the insinuation. They both break out into a fit of giggles at that. \u201cYeah yeah, I got it, just give me my shit and be on your way.\u201d\n\u201cNo way!\u201d Pidge sticks out their tongue, light reflecting off the piercing there. \u201cI trekked through mountains and valleys just to get you your stuff. Lost my valued companion, Hunk, at the volcano area, where he decided to stop by and bake some more cupcakes.\"\n\u201dDrama.\u201d\n\u201cHey now, there was a traffic jam on the main street, cut me some slack. I don\u2019t appreciate public transport. A lady who sat next to me smelled of old cabbage. I think some scent rubbed off on me, sniff it.\u201d They hold up the sleeve of their mustard-yellow cardigan and shove it under Lance\u2019s nose.\n\u201cGet your sleeve away, ew.\u201d\n\u201cC\u2019mon, sniff it!\u201d\n\u201cPidge, gross!\u201d\nThey end up play-fighting. Eventually, Pidge takes their hand away, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you complained so much about this place? It\u2019s nice enough.\u201d Pidge assesses, looking around with big curious eyes as though they haven\u2019t been there like 5165165 times before. \"The people seem alright.\"\nTheir light brown eyes fall on the street gang squad \u2013 Asshole club, or so Lance dubs them inside his mind \u2013 and they start punching at each other, pointing in their direction. They have nasty grins on their faces. Lance silently begins praying for their safety.\n\u201cHey, McClain, introduce us to your girlfriend!\u201d It's the guy whom Lance affectionately calls Jelly and who looks like he should be playing quarterback on a football team instead of trying to pick up Keith while pushing Lance away from the instructor whenever he gets the chance. Lance doesn\u2019t really give a shit about that guy, so he only presses his palms together and inhales, whispering a soft \u2018Boi, you done\u2019.\nIn a split second, Pidge goes to berserker mode, shoulders hunched and fists clenched, the fire of hell blazing in their eyes. Lance tends to call it the Saiyan pose, except it\u2019s ten times more frightening despite Pidge\u2019s height. Even Vegeta would be cowering away.\nIt still takes just as much yelling.\nThe short youth looks close to spitting on the ground to assert dominance.\n\u201cCome closer and say that to my fucking face, shithead. I\u2019ll punch the grin off your mouth,\u201d they roar and take a few steps in the gang\u2019s direction.\nLance feigns deep offense. \u201cOuch, you hurt my feelings. I\u2019ll have you know that I\u2019m very date-able.\u201d\n\u201cShut it, Lance. I\u2019m trying to show them that if they mess with you, they mess with me,\u201d Pidge silently hisses over their shoulder.\nLance actually swoons a little. \u201cMy hero in flip-flops!\u201d\nSurprisingly, or just not wanting to get kicked out of the camp \u2013 Allura made it pretty clear that any physical violence would result in instant expulsion \u2013 they back off, unhappy, heads bowed.\nPidge crosses their arms, standing tall. \u201cYeah, you better run!\u201d\n\u201cIs there a fight going on?\u201d a voice asks from right behind them, and oh, that's why. The duo turns around, Pidge with fists still raised, while Lance mutters a silent \u2018Shit\u2019.\n\u201cNooo, no, why would you say that \u2013 down, Pidge.\u201d Lance elbows his sibling, but Pidge only stands frozen in the spot, jaw hanging open and Lance can feel. Shiro tends to have that effect on people.\nEspecially the ex-RB fans.\nShiro raises his sharp, divine eyebrows, head slightly cocked to the side. \u201cAnd who\u2019s your fierce friend, Lance? I don\u2019t think they\u2019re from my group.\u201d\nPidge colors a deep maroon and straightens up. \u201cSiblings,\u201d they echo at the same time. Shiro\u2019s smile softens some more, leaving the McClains swooning a little, hands clammy. No one should have soft gazes like that. Shiro looks at people like they\u2019re the best thing since sliced bread.\n\u201cAh, brought you the stuff?\u201d\n\u201cYiss,\u201d Pidge croaks awkwardly, toes wiggling. Lance can tell that they\u2019re trying very hard to contain excitement.\nShiro, the cinnamon roll that he is, remains blissfully unaware of Pidge\u2019s colored face. Or chooses to ignore it.\nThey shake hands. Pidge somehow manages not to fuck up the introduction \u2013 McClance has become the new meme in their group chat and Lance wants it to die already \u2013 as Shiro refocuses his attention on the brunet.\n\u201cI just wanted to tell you that Keith\u2019s expecting you to dance this evening.\u201d\nLance has to frown at that. He didn\u2019t think that Keith would let him anywhere close to the dancefloor on the night of reviews. He\u2019s yelled at him more than enough times to leave that impression. \u201cAre you sure? I mean, I\u2019m not officially registered here. It wouldn\u2019t be fair.\u201c\nShiro only waves an arm. \u201cAllura has taken care of everything. You\u2019re already here, so you might as well consider yourself an official member of this dance camp.\u201d He looks a little confused when he sees Pidge snort and whisper \u2018Oh the irony\u2019 while Lance bows his head in defeat.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2013\u201c\n\u201cLance, you\u2019re good enough for this. Trust me.\u201d\nPidge casually leans against a column, ankles crossed, and examines their neon green nails. \u201cI taught him the bboying.\u201d They look up to Shiro to gouge a reaction.\nLance still hesitates.\nIs he really good enough compared to all those street dance kids who are light years ahead of him when it comes to technicalities and true experience? He\u2019s been out of commission for so long; two days just aren\u2019t enough to feel confident. Confident enough to perform in front of Keith and a critical audience.\nAs if reading his thoughts, Shiro sighs. \u201cYou know, Keith has put a lot of time and effort into you these past few days. Repaying him with a fitting performance is the least you can do. Allura as well.\u201d\nLance heaves a sigh. Shiro is not so subtly guilt-tripping him here, and he honestly has no other choice. He has to repay Allura for everything - for never giving up on him, for granting him a second chance, for letting him in here for free. Letting him reconnect with his inner world, his idols.\nHe feels himself close to tears of gratitude yet again.\nLance just really loves his friends.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201c He sniffles and pretends that there\u2019s something in his eye. \u201cDon\u2019t expect anything from me, though. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll win my right to perform on the last day.\u201d\n\u201cJust try,\u201d Shiro pleads, giving him a fatherly pat on the back, and that\u2019s that. \u201cAnd Pidge, you\u2019re more than welcome to stay for dinner.\u201d\nPidge coughs into their fist and fingerguns. \u201cAy, gotcha.\u201d\nShiro laughs lightly at the action, bidding them farewell. Lance heaves one last sigh and decides to get his shit together. Moping around has never actually done him any good. Shiro's right \u2013 he can always try.\u00a0Even if lately he keeps fucking up more than usual.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work when you do this,\u201d he says nonchalantly, ruffling through the huge bag that Pidge has graciously packed for him.\nPidge continues staring at Shiro\u2019s retreating form, fingers still curled up in that silly pose, and glares at the other. \u201cDoes too.\u201d\n\u201cDoes not.\u201d\n\u201cDoes too.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe you were tryna pull moves on Shiro. Dude, no. He\u2019s like ultimate dad material, I think he just adopted you, actually.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just for fun, don\u2019t be so whiny about it. I\u2019m gonna leave the marriage rights to you.\u201d\nAnd with that, they\u2019re back to normal.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf I get all these extra cheese pizzas every time I end up at dance camps, then you\u2019re more than welcome to sign me up to dance on the grandest of stages while wearing a bikini and stilettos,\u201d Lance squeaks in excitement and then takes a\u00a0slice of heaven on earth, his mouth watering. It smells absolutely delicious.\n\u201cYou just ruined my appetite, thanks,\u201d Em grouches - while Lance mumbles \u2018Not my fault that your imagination is raunchy\u2019 - biting into her pizza slice.\nThey were supposed to have a nice family dinner, but Pidge took their share and fucked off to Shiro\u2019s room under the pretense of wanting to converse with Allura. Lance opens their chat to check out Pidge\u2019s shitspam liveblogs.\n\n[19:35 pm] Group chat name changed to: stop takashi shirogane 2k16\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): He\u2019s like, whoa momma, fans self \n\n\nI\u2019d sleep on those tiddies like pillows\n\n\nHave you noticed that he has that perfect dorito-shaped body? H o w. I wanna know his secrets.\n\n\nHe\u2019s so nice, I\u2019m gonna cryyyy\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): ohhh you got it bad i told you its a family trait\n\n\n[20:01 pm] Group chat name changed to: pidge calm ur thirst 2k16\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson):I absolutely do not, I just want to appreciate a fine body when I see one\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain) sent whythefuckyoulying.mov\n\n\nEm vs pidgeboi who will win\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): Money's on allura ;)\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): Damn, Hunk. Damn. Ice cold, bro.\n\n\nBut Shiro really is very \u2013\n\nAnd that\u2019s where he stops reading. All of it is just Pidge writing an essay about Shiro\u2019s abs and he knows that \u2018Ode to the Booty\u2019 is impending. Whatever, he\u2019s a total Keith-boy.\nSpeaking of.\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna let your boyfriend suffer any more in their company or are you going to do something about it?\u201d Em mutters around her bite, not bothering to look his way.\n\u201cHe is not my boyfriend.\u201d\n\u201cSay that to Ma when you bring him for dinner in a few days.\u201d\n\u201cPft, yeah right,\u201d Lance laughs nervously and continues observing Keith, who is currently surrounded from all sides by young adults, all of them offering slices of different pizzas. Keith politely turns down the offerings, visibly trying to escape, uncomfortable.\nIt hurts to watch, actually.\nBy now, Lance can easily decipher the look that the other wears and he can see that the instructor looks close to socking a wet-leaf in human form in the eye. He has to keep up the \u2018nice teacher\u2019 fa\u00e7ade though, so he only forces a smile, a muscle twitching in his jaw. Keith hurriedly stands, trying to get away before another person reaches out to him.\nRinse and repeat for ten minutes now.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Em asks again, wiping her fingers with a napkin.\nLance hates moments like this. She just knows.\nWith a sigh, he rises and jumps over the multiple pizza boxes strewn across his path. The guy seems to be bothering Keith even more, so Lance bodily inserts himself between the two, face carefully emotionless when he turns to the annoyance and says, \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t want your goddamn pepperoni. He\u2019s a bloody vegan. Piss off, bye.\u201d\nHe then unceremoniously drags Keith away by the wrist, easily navigating around the clusterfuck of horny teens.\nKeith pulls his hand away, frowning lightly. \u201cHow\u2019d you even know that I \u2013 \u201c\nOf course, no \u2018thank you'.\n\u201cEm told me!\u201d Lance squeaks, embarrassed. His sister sits in hearing range and simply raises her middle finger at him, followed by a flat stare.\nLance thinks that he hears something close to \u2018You sure know a lot about me\u2019, but that might as well be a figment of his imagination. He grabs a pizza box from the ground. After a beat of hesitation, Keith cautiously follows him to the farthest corner of the hall, settling next to him. Lance offers him a flat stare, stomach begging to be stuffed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to mind if I eat this, right?\u201d he questions and wiggles his fingers before taking a slice of some spicy ass pizza that looks like it\u2019s going to leave his stomach aching for days. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m against animal abuse, but-\u201c He tries to catch the string of cheese with his tongue before it reaches his clean sweatshirt.\nKeith huffs, incredulous, and pulls off his small backpack. \u201cI\u2019m not going to shove my beliefs down your throat. Eat whatever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cNot going to do that? Who are you, stranger?\u201d Lance jokes. Keith pinches his thigh in retaliation.\nHe says nothing more, only unpacks his \u2018rabbit food\u2019.\nLance stares at what is obviously cheese. \u201cVegans don\u2019t eat that, right?\u201d he points at it, curious.\nKeith crosses his legs, shrugging. \u201cIt has no dairy in it.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you make a cheese without milk?\u201d Lance squints, eyebrows furrowed. Man, vegans sure come up with a lot of new ways to get basic stuff. He respects it, though. Takes creativity.\nKeith cuts a small piece and chews on it, shoulders relaxed and eyes lidded. Lance tries very hard not to observe how nice he looks under the glare of the fluorescent lights, soft, black hair framing his pale face. \u201cWell, this one is made from almonds,\u201d Keith explains once he swallows the bite. \u201cThere are many different recipes to make cheese. Shiro knows how to make one from seeds.\u201d\nA snort to his side catches Keith\u2019s attention. Lance looks like he\u2019s trying very hard not to crack some joke or bust a lung, but he lets out another snicker and it tumbles out of his dumb mouth anyways. \u201cThis is nut cheese?\u201d\nKeith looks at him with a miffed expression as Lance starts laughing to himself. Oh god, priceless. \u201cDude, you seriously eat nut cheese. Oh my god, Pidge is gonna love this.\u201d\n\u201cEver the poster boy for maturity, aren\u2019t you, McClain?\u201d\nLance\u2019s laughter dies down only when he sees the questioning look changing to annoyance, and dials down the dirty jokes, wiping at his damp eye. \u201cSorry, man, it\u2019s just too funny. Now then, give me a piece of that.\u201d He goes for Keith\u2019s hand, but the instructor only pulls it back.\nThey wrestle for the knife, yet Keith gives up, not wanting any extreme injuries. \u201cYou seriously don\u2019t have to. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to like it. \u201c\n\u201cHow bad can nut cheese be?\u201d Lance snorts, cutting himself a slice.\nKeith facepalms, defeated, far too tired to reason with the other.\nThe taste that greets his tongue isn\u2019t exactly awful, but it\u2019s kind of plain and clashes with the remains of Tabasco sauce from the pizza. Lance chews languidly and tries to keep his face clear of any negative emotions.\nKeith peers at him curiously, expecting some sort of critique.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Lance lies and swallows.\nA knowing smile tugs on Keith\u2019s lips. He huffs an almost laugh. \u201cYou just scrunched up your nose. You don\u2019t have to lie.\u201d\n\u201cNo, back off, I\u2019m eating this goddamn nut cheese,\u201d Lance quips and pushes Keith\u2019s prying hands away. Feeling oddly determined and ready to please, he cuts himself another slice. \"Best cheese I've ever had. Shut up, you know nothing about me!\"\nKeith sighs and continues watching Lance with a fondly exasperated look.\nThey end up sharing the extra big container of Ma\u2019s family recipe salad, the pizza forgotten.\n\u00a0\nLance searches for Pidge, only to find Shiro sitting like an inch away from Allura, biting into a big ass burger. He looks up, startled, chewing guiltily. Lance crosses his arms.\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s your excuse, Mr. 'I support Keith and will take up this vegetarian quest even if it kills me?'\u201d\nThe older man swallows the large bite. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Keith. He\u2019s been obsessed with me eating healthy after the whole, uh, incident, so that my wounds would close up better and scar at minimum. The food that you consume affects the healing process.\u201d It honest to god sounds like a quote from his partner.\nIt\u2019s not like Lance can blame him, he could go for a cheeseburger himself. That cheese was by no means his kind of food, and he ended up giving Keith the bigger share of the salad after noticing how much the other enjoyed it.\nLance promised to invite him for dinner next time.\nHe\u2019s ready to dub his younger sister a prophet.\nBut there was something undeniably sweet about the moment and the shared food that made Lance forget his initial hunger as the two of them bonded over recipes, all while he carefully dodged all questions related to Lance's past dancing experiences.\nKeith doesn\u2019t need to know. Not yet.\n\u00a0\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): do you ever have it so bad that you eat nut cheese for them\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): He ate my nut cheese when no one else would\u2026\u2026 \u2013 keith probably, 2k16\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson):If I were Keith, I\u2019d marry you immediately\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): youre both uninvited to the wedding\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): When you go on ur honeymoon dont forget to visit your cousin - the dead sea\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): It\u2019s the only thing saltier than your sorry ass.\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): fineeee whatever youre invited just bring me mickey ds to wash down that nut taste\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): Yay!!! :))\n\nThe evening, along with dance camp reviews, comes far too soon.\nLance barely manages to sneak in some warm-up routines, stomach twisting with anxiety all the while. This is it, his great comeback, his chance to prove himself. In Keith\u2019s eyes, at least.\nHowever, he didn\u2019t expect there to be more than three judges, two of them being Shiro and Allura.\nLance bites at the dry skin around his fingernails as he stares at the professional-looking judges. Two women he's never seen before, both in their forties, dressed in posh blazers and dark pencil skirts.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be so serious,\u201d he mutters around his thumb. Pidge smacks the hand away. A good thing - usually, Lance would make his fingertips bleed first before ceasing his ministrations.\n\u201cYou\u2019re at a dance camp located at the most extravagant dance school in the region. I don\u2019t know what you were expecting.\u201d Pidge shrugs and points out the rest of the street dance kids discreetly fixing their appearances, obviously floored by the intimidating ladies as well. Lance feels as though he\u2019s back at high school, ready to take the math quiz of a lifetime. Those ladies sure fit the 'strict teacher' image.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d they continue. \u201cEveryone\u2019s just as uneasy. Personally, I think that you\u2019re going to do fine. This isn\u2019t your first rodeo.\u201d Right as Pidge says it, Lance\u2019s phone buzzes with a new chat notification, Hunk\u2019s cheerful \u2018wish I was there, man, do your best!!!:)))\u2019 doing nothing to calm his frayed nerves.\nLance barely restrains himself from blowing a raspberry. \u201cYeah, but none of them were so\u2026\u201d He waves a hand in the general direction of Shiro and Allura, who are busy entertaining the judges, both of them dressed as though they\u2019re ready for a grand ball. Allura\u2019s lilac dress nearly glows in the faded lights of the huge chandelier. \u201cSo fancy and high-class! It's like they\u2019re about to force me to freestyle to the hottest Tchaikovsky beats. I mean, sure, maybe Keith can do stuff like that with his complicated twirl obsession and tiptoe torture, but I-\u201d\n\u201cLance, you\u2019re babbling.\u201d\n\u201cI am not babbling!\u201d Lance babbles nervously, voice cracking and high-pitched. \u201cI am most definitely not babbling, and never was. Where\u2019d you get that idea.\u201c\nWhat did his Pa say about situations like these? Breathe in and exhale for eight seconds? Four? How many? God, he doesn\u2019t know.\nThey stick around and check out the ballet kids\u2019 performances, only truly paying attention once it\u2019s Em\u2019s turn to shine. She does wonderfully and receives heated clapping from her fellow peers, the loudest being from the small group of girls she had befriended over the span of two days. Allura flashes her a bright smile when she bows and walks off the stage to rejoin her friends, undoing her tight bun immediately.\nWhen it's time for the street dance competitions to start, Pidge nearly has to drag an unwilling Lance to the second-floor western hall. Lance wants to claw at the walls. Pidge has to forcefully tug him away from every column that he manages to latch onto, whining about quitting and going home all the while.\nThis whole thing was a huge mistake. He\u2019d much rather be home right now, eating Ma\u2019s cooking and crying himself to sleep while desperately trying to do math, burying himself under multiple notebooks in order to absorb at least some of their knowledge.\n\u201cRiling up Keith is one thing, Pidge. This is pretty damn big,\u201d Lance winces when they finally reach the huge double doors, and in one last attempt to save himself, the brunet desperately tries to latch onto the door frame. Some teens pass them by, shooting pitying looks at the tall boy. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly friends with high expectations!\u201d\nPidge kind of gets annoyed by that and wants to kick his ass inside, but doesn\u2019t have the time to do it because a heavily-accented voice resounds behind them. \u201cLance, my boy, is that you?\u201d\nThe distraught brunet directs tear-filled, blue eyes to a cheerful old man, dressed in a well-fitted pinstripe suit, a luscious mustache doing nothing to cover his wide grin.\n\u201cCoran!\u201d he squeaks in surprise. He tries to brush up his act, letting go of the door frame immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see you!\u201d\n\u201cLikewise. And do tell, what are you lads doing in a place like this?\u201d The older man brushes at his ginger mustache, eyeing them with a quirked eyebrow. \u201cGot lost on your way to the Echo finals?\u201d\nLance tries to ignore the painful stab in his stomach at the mention of that tournament in particular, but decides to hide the discomfort instead. \u201cThe same could be said to you!\u201d he counters, crossing his arms. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cAllura asked me to judge the performances of Shiro\u2019s kids.\u201d Coran tugs on the lapels of his navy blazer, chest puffed out. \u201cI must say that it is quite an honor! Ah, I\u2019ve missed the good old days\u2026\u201d\nLance clearly remembers the first time Allura dropped the bomb on him when she told him that her uncle - the headmaster of Ms. Altea's School of Fine Arts - used to mingle with bboyers at underground dance competitions, mostly doing judge work and making sure that the shows went by smoothly without any excessive cheating. However, he quit that lifestyle the moment Allura\u2019s father died and left him in charge of the school.\nLance can\u2019t help but respect the man for all the effort that he has put into changing himself and learning, extensively studying different styles over the years, in addition to taking over as the headmaster.\nDifferent styles\u2026?\nLance chokes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to judge my performance. Keith and I-\u201c\n\u201cAre two sides of the same coin, therefore, I expect that you will manage to bring out the best in each other.\u201c Allura steps in at that moment, Shiro following a few paces behind. Her gaze seems stern.\n\u201cI hope that you have learned a thing or two about cooperation at this camp, Lance,\u201d she says in a threatening voice, thin eyebrows furrowed. The brunet doesn\u2019t need to open his mouth to reply because he knows that she knows.\nHe and Keith\u2026 aren\u2019t exactly on the same mindset or level of skill, especially now that Keith feels like controlling all of Lance\u2019s movements according to his will.\nThey've somehow managed to work together a bit better after that shared dinner, but Keith\u2019s fuse was still pretty damn short whenever Lance\u2019s fluid movements halted or lagged.\nShiro\u2019s a little kinder on the matter, watching Allura with doe-like eyes. She takes it upon herself to drag her uncle away, chatting all the while. \u201cI know that you can do it.\u201d Is all that the older man manages to sneak in before he has to catch up with the rest of the judge team.\n\u201cAnd there you have it,\u201d Pidge quips, draggin a frozen Lance inside. \u201cNow let\u2019s observe the competition before it\u2019s your turn to get roasted.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Lance says dryly, yet lacking any actual sarcasm.\nPidge looks at him for a long moment and takes out their bright green phone to type something out. Probably about how Lance has finally lost his marbles.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Keith asks, standing on his tiptoes and reaching for the ceiling in a full-body stretch.\nLance is about to throw up as he continues reaching for his toes. His shoelaces are triple knotted.\n\u201cNever been better,\u201d he forces out, inspecting his reflection in the mirror. His face is chalk-colored at best.\nLance drags his snapback lower, just so that his partner doesn\u2019t have to see his stricken expression. Keith observes him in the mirror.\n\u00a0\nHis heart pounds somewhere in the back of his throat as the stage lights momentarily blind him. Lance tries his hardest not to look at the five figures sitting in the front row, gazes scrutinizing, searching for any slip-ups that might occur. The hall is almost full - a blur of colors and stony faces. The lights are too damn bright.\nLance can\u2019t even see Keith anymore, the other man bathed in yellows and oranges, akin to a dance god born for greatness, destined to conquer grand stages with the fluidity of his movements. Lance, the foolish mortal thinking himself a divinity, tries not to think too much about the overwhelming gap in talent between them. Sweat begins gathering under his collar, but he keeps going.\n\n'Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?\n\n\nFeeling jaded, huh?'\n\nKeith\u2019s a blur of red hues. Lance\u2019s eyes follow those long legs as his own arms do the automatic combo of elbow, elbow, drop, twist, knees outwards in a slide, throwback, boom boom, and are the lights getting more blinding?\nHis eyes are still glued to Keith\u2019s legs as he copies the movements to his best capability. Step, step, down, up, pull.\nDid they practice this part?\n\nStep, step\u2013\n\nAnd then Keith\u2019s in his personal space before they clumsily collide.\n\u201cStop the music!\u201d\nOne of the judges frigidly gestures at the balcony.\nThere go the stage lights, the music, the glory, and the appreciation.\n\u00a0\nLance, honest to god, wants to cry tears of frustration. He wants Keith to look his way, but the latter only drags punishing fingers through the black mess of his hair, inhaling sharply as he takes a few steps away from Lance, disappointed, ashamed, everything but\u2013\n\nProud.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just,\u201d Lance chokes out into the deathly silence, neck blazing hot and vision blurry with unshed tears. \u201cPack my stuff\u2026\u201d he vaguely gestures to the backstage, taking an uncertain step in that direction.\nOne of the women, her golden hair braided into what seems to be a crown, only glowers over the top of her half-moon glasses, green eyes icy. Lance gulps nervously, freezing in his spot.\nFor a few seconds, she continues observing them. Lance tries very hard not to look in Keith\u2019s general direction, though he can still see that defeated stance in his periphery.\n\u201cI\u2019ve expected better from your partner, Shirogane,\u201d she directs it to Shiro, who looks very confused as to what just happened. The fact that she completely disregards Keith\u2019s existence, even though he is the instructor here, makes Lance\u2019s unfortunate partner\u2019s shoulders slump even more.\nShiro gnaws on his lower lip and exhales. No one dares to make a sound.\n\u201cYou mentioned that this is the best student in your group. Is that correct?\u201d she finally snaps in Keith\u2019s direction, looking over the stack of papers placed on the desk, and searching for Lance\u2019s folder.\n\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am,\u201d he nods, barely audible. Keith sounds like a child being scolded.\nLance feels himself dying a little on the inside.\nThe words \u2018best student\u2019 echo in his head over and over again. He failed the other miserably.\n\u201cIn all my years of judging at these events, I\u2019ve never seen anyone so\u2026 out of sync. Not technicality-wise, but\u2026\u201d Another judge begins, gnawing on the end of her pencil. \u201cIt\u2019s like you boys aren\u2019t on the same page at all. Your pupil is blindly following your every step as though he has no body language - no will, if you may - of his own. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re up for this task, or whether you\u2019re qualified enough, because instead of teaching, you blatantly wanted to create a perfect copy of yourself. Dancing is all about freedom and not trying to squeeze someone into the frames of your making.\u201d\nKeith bows his head in shame, shoulders dropping even further. \u201cI understand.\u201d\n\u201cIf I may speak up,\u201d Allura cuts in tentatively, using her official voice. Lance almost wants to curl up on the floor and ask her to stop, to stop shielding his useless ass, stop trying to prove others that he\u2019s worth something, when he is clearly not. \u201cMr. McClain has been freestyling all his life. If anyone is to blame here, it\u2019d be me. Perhaps I was too\u2026 brash for thinking that he could fit into the dance routine regime standard in the span of a mere few days.\u201c\n\u201c\u2019A few days\u2019, you say\u2026?\u201d Coran leans back in his chair and begins twirling at his mustache, lost deep in thought.\nLance\u2019s almost grateful when the judges start arguing over whose fault it was for bringing in a complete street rat and thinking that it could dance. Of course, they don\u2019t say that out loud, but that\u2019s what Lance gets from their conversation anyways. At least he has the time to discreetly wipe away at the corners of his eyes, bubbling with tears of humiliation.\nFor a split second, Keith\u2019s gaze lands on him. Coran speaks up. \u201cLance, are you comfortable with performing once again?\u201d\nThe dancer duo simultaneously opens their mouths to voice out why this is a terrible idea, but Coran only waves a dismissive hand. The rest of the unvoiced protests die down immediately. The ginger man seems to be uncharacteristically serious. \u201cAlone, if you may. Forget the small details and the technicalities. Take the base of Keith\u2019s teachings and freestyle however you see fit. Can you do that?\u201d\nLance feels Keith\u2019s indigo eyes burning holes into his side. He takes in a short breath and nods once he sees Allura\u2019s curt nod.\nCoran returns the gesture. The music drowns out the muted whispers of multiple people shifting in their seats. Lance closes his eyes.\nHe has to show them his best before he gets booted out. Gotta go out with a bang.\n\u00a0\nThree, two, one.\nLance fixes his hat.\n\u00a0\n\n'I was good on my own, that's the way it was, that's the way it was,\n\n\nYou was good on the low for a faded fuck, on some faded love'\n\nThe hours spent practicing Keith\u2019s routine are ingrained in the core of his being, but here he is, making the sensual moves even smoother now that he has no strict guidelines to follow. He's easy in his step, fluid in the way his hands brush over his torso as Lance dips lower than usual, putting his entire body and soul into moving his upper body \u2013 your core strength, Lance.\nThat voice sounds suspiciously like Keith.\nHis sneakers produce pleasant squeaks against the stage's polished surface when he expertly twists his foot and then the rest of his frame to match the beat. He visualizes the long hours spent sweating in front of that mirror wall, trying to copy Keith.\nAnd shit. He finally gets it.\nHe isn\u2019t meant to copy anyone.\nHe isn\u2019t meant to be like Keith or Shiro or anyone else. He\u2019s meant to be Lance with his own faults and unique style. He finally unwinds.\n\n'Don\u2019t get it twisted\u2018\n\nHis fingertips smack lightly against his hip, leg rolling smoothly, and the first yell of appreciation can be heard over the song. It\u2019s as though someone has flipped a switch in his hearing, he thinks, when he hears more and more positive hums joining in. The appreciation undeniably fuels his tricky movements, motivating him to do better.\nThe straying tears dry. Lance finally feels lost in his element, a broad grin tugging at his lips.\nHe flips his snapback in the air and goes wild to the sound of encouraging roars.\nFuck Keith\u2019s reign and his kingdom, honestly.\nHe easily pulls off Keith\u2019s choice hip rolls, adding more bounce and energy into every single one, slowing down at appropriate moments. When the cheering gets even louder, he summons his long-since-forgotten bboying skills, dropping on the ground with the perfection that only comes with countless hours spent practicing.\n\nDown in a graceful flip, for a split second, the floor is solid against his back.\n\nOne fancy flip of a snapback later, he finishes his on-the-spot bullshitted routine, bowing as the crowd, which looked down on him just a few hours ago, yells in appreciation, with Pidge and Em going insane in the back.\nShiro\u2019s laughter is rambunctious when he smacks a palm against the table, making it shudder from the force. \u201cThat\u2019s more like it!\u201d He points at the stage, grinning from ear to ear.\nThe wide-eyed judges heatedly whisper among themselves. Allura covers her pretty mouth, eyes glistening with mirth. She discreetly points to Lance\u2019s right, making the brunet look up.\nKeith is panting beside him, rolling his neck. He usually does it after he completes a good dance routine. Lance\u2019s lower lip quivers when he catches Keith\u2019s lovely smile.\n\nCould it be\u2026?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good frontman, Lance,\u201d he chuckles quietly, eyes glistening, teeth flashing in a satisfied grin.\nIt finally registers, that yes, this just happened. Keith joined in on his performance midway through, and he actually...\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that you followed my lead! I knew that you had it in you.\u201d Lance playfully elbows his side, pushing at the tip of his askew hat to face Keith better, presenting the black-haired man with the softest smile he usually saves for his closest friends and family.\nThe mushy look that Keith rewards him with could be described as starry-eyed, but his tone is awfully smug when he bats the offending limb away. \u201cDon\u2019t think that it\u2019s always going to be like that. I could still kick your ass.\u201d\n\u201cIn your dreams, pretty boy.\u201d Lance winks, never ceasing to smile.\nLance has heard stories of the ultimate bonding moments, and has had plenty of those with Hunk and Pidge, but the electrifying feeling that courses through him is indescribable. A shared moment of victory and glory between them.\nLance feels them connecting in a new and exciting way.\nHe looks at Keith, feeling like he could kiss him right then and there beneath the blinding stage lights.\nSadly, the reality knocks on their personal bubble in the form of Coran, who is nothing short of proud and floored. Lance feels himself flush with happiness.\n\u201cMy boy, you never cease to amaze me!\u201d the older man exclaims, sniffling. Allura places a gentle hand on his bicep, looking a little emotional herself. \u201cYou\u2019ve always had a special talent in you that's, as all of us can see now, is not meant to be easily tamed. Which brings me to a very important point.\u201c He stands up and spreads his arms as though ready to hug all of his precious students and guests. \u201cAs the late headmaster once told me, dancing is all about freedom. Don\u2019t be afraid to break the rules every now and then, and always try to learn from fellow dancers. They can teach you more than you think.\u201d\nLance and Keith exchange a knowing look.\n\u201cAlways strive to develop your respective strengths, and the best way to do it, as dear Allura and Shiro have mentioned at the start of day one, are at these kinds of events. A round of applause for cooperation and appreciation, everyone!\u201d Wild clapping follows. Lance covers his laughter behind a curled hand, subtly eyeing Keith, who politely joins the masses. It seems that one of the judges is forcing herself to do it \u2013 a strict ballet instructor from NYC, Lance will later find out \u2013 but the good mood is unbreakable. Undeniable.\nLance feels as though a massive boulder has been lifted off his tired shoulders.\n\u201cYou\u2019re finally working together!\u201d Allura yells over the noise, touched. \u201cContinue on this path, and I will repeat Coran\u2019s words: learn from each other and be patient. You\u2019re both unique in your respective fields and your dance styles are different, but if you combine them, I\u2019m certain you can come up with something beautiful that'll amaze us on the final day!\u201d she flashes a thumbs up. \u201cMake me proud, Lance! You too, Keith!\u201d\nThe brunet rapidly blinks at that. Wait, final day?\n\u201cExcuse me, but there\u2019s been some sort of misunderstanding?\u201d He tries to catch Allura's attention, but Coran is already on his way through another speech, leaving the masses roaring. Some kids climb on the stage to begin their warm-ups, ready for the next round. Lance hops around in frustration. \u201cGuys, explain this!\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it pretty clear that I\u2019ve had my eye on you since day one, Lance?\u201d Keith wonders out loud while looking over the ensuing chaos, a gentle gleam in his eyes. He inspects his nails.\nLance waves a hand in his direction, not bothering to look up. \u201cWe will flirt later, pretty boy. I have to find out what they meant by 'amaze us on the final - \u201d Lance freezes and lowers his arm, eyes growing wide.\nSuddenly, everything makes an awful lot more sense. Shiro and Allura acting secretive, Keith chasing him around until he would nearly drop from exhaustion, this entire event-\nKeith looks too damn sly when he crosses his arms, sticking out his hip. His trademark 'cocky instructor' stance. \u201cCongratulations, McClain. I hope that you\u2019re ready to cooperate.\u201d That smirk is filled with bad intentions.\nIn response, Lance dramatically drops down to his knees, arms raised. \u201cI thank Lord Almighty and the Divine Miss Allura Altea for this chance!\u201d he yells, earning a muffled laugh from Keith. The instructor pushes the brim of Lance's hat over his eyes, gracefully walking off the stage and running to Shiro.\nLance rubs at his dark red cheek and gets chased away by the impatient dancers a moment later.\nThe second he hops off the stage, he's tackled by Em and Pidge. He hugs them close and feels like the happiest man alive.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI give you the honors.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you.\u201d\n\u201cYou.\u201d\n\u201cYou had to deal with my needy ass for days, so make this choice.\u201d\nKeith sighs, eyebrows furrowed. He and Lance may understand each other better now, but they still banter over every single thing. \u201cFine, but don\u2019t blame me if I pick a bad one. I\u2019m not very lucky with lotteries,\u201d the black-haired instructor mumbles.\n\u201cJust stick it in already!\u201d Lance snorts and shakes the bubble-shaped glass vase in front of him, full of folded papers with the names of songs for their future combo dance scribbled on them. Truly, this is quite the gamble, but he trusts Shiro\u2019s music taste more than Keith\u2019s. Whatever they might pull out, it probably won\u2019t be too bad.\nKeith rolls his eyes and pushes a hand through the opening, randomly touching a few papers before pulling one out.\nHe unfolds the paper, but doesn\u2019t get to read it because Lance rips it away, almost dropping the vase in his haste. \u201cOh man, that\u2019s the luckiest hand ever! We got Beyonc\u00e9!\u201d he waves it in front of Keith\u2019s face so much that the other has to catch the brunet\u2019s wrist with an exaggerated scoff.\n\u201cJust stop doing that and let me-\u201c\nLance watches Keith's frame tense up as his gaze runs over the small lettering multiple times almost as though he cannot believe that he\u2019ll have to dance to Beyonc\u00e9. Lance can't quite believe it either, but his disbelief is mostly of ecstatic kind. Now he\u2019s more-than-eager to start, whereas Keith\u2026\n\u201cYou okay there, buddy?\u201d Lance questions, bending lower to peer at Keith\u2019s stone-like face.\nThe instructor emerges from his trance only after Lance snaps his fingers in front of his vacant eyes.\n\u201cHuh? Yeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\nLance can see that he\u2019s everything but fine when Keith slips out of range before his pupil can question him again.\n\u00a0\nTired from the excessive stress and strain, Lance barely manages to drag his ass to the sleeping quarters after sending Pidge on their way home. He has a proper sleeping bag now and what could be tentatively referred to as PJs. The attire consists of an old \"Adventure Time\" shirt gifted to him by Em a lifetime ago, Jake\u2019s face a little faded from the wash, and a pair of neon pink shorts. Thanks again, Pidge, you shitnugget. He\u2019s glad that tonight, too, he gets to sleep alone. He\u2019d be far too embarrassed if his sister\u2019s friends got to see him in this fit. It already happened once when Maxi, his older brother, brought home his poker buds without telling Lance beforehand.\nThe shame was unbearable. He got called \u201cPonyboy\u201d at school for at least a year, but everyone somehow thought that it was a cool reference to the 'Outsiders' instead of his Rainbow Dash sleeping shirt. Curse Hunk\u2019s creative gifts!\nLance wakes up a few hours later and realizes that he isn\u2019t as alone as he\u2019d like to think.\nAgain, he hears that peculiar rustling, and peels his tired eyes open, only to find Keith standing in shorts and a loose shirt, scrolling through his phone. He coughs into his fist. Lance groans, curling up in the sleeping bag, and pretends that he\u2019s a caterpillar, except that he\u2019s a majestic butterfly. Who is he kidding?\nHe produces a police siren noise, making Keith jump up, startled. \u201dHold it, mister. What do you think you are doing up at...\u201c Lance checks his watch. \u201c3 am!?\u201d His eyes widen as he wiggles around in the sleeping bag some more in a poor attempt to seem intimidating. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that we are partners now and I need you at your best performance today!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018today\u2019 until I sleep.\u201d Keith shrugs. Lance can see the black circles under his dark eyes. \u201cI was about to dress up and go practice some more. Someone\u2019s gotta come up with the moves.\u201d\n\u201cI'll take that as an offense to my capabilities.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Keith pulls on circus tent-like sweatpants over his shorts. They poof out weirdly. \u201cTake your own advice and rest up. We got a rough day ahead of us.\u201d\nLance wiggles closer to Keith in a threatening way, glowering. The other raises his eyebrows, unimpressed by the worm impersonation. Well, Lance is far too comfortable to leave the safety of his cocoon, but Keith's seriously testing his patience. \u201cNo way, Jose. Go to sleep!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you what I do during nighttime?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just looking out for ya! You\u2019ve been dancing like crazy for hours now. The least you can do is rest up.\u201d\nKeith huffs, running a hand through his tangled hair. \u201cThink of it as a breather, then. I won\u2019t overdo it or something.\u201d\nLance tries to navigate his arms in the restrictive space to unzip the sleeping bag, eyebrows scrunched up. \u201cSleep!\u201d\nKeith starts lacing his sneakers, annoyed with his companion. \u201cKeep your voice down!\u201d he reprimands just as loudly, if not louder. Someone tosses around on the floor on the other side of the curtain. \u201cI literally can\u2019t sleep, let it go. I\u2019ve had insomnia for like two years now,\u201d Keith\u2019s voice is nothing short of hollow when he says it, fingers stilling for a while, resting on the laces. \u201cI don\u2019t like sleeping. I always get\u2026 nightmares.\u201d\nLance sits up in his half-open sleeping bag adorned with white planets and moons, and goes quiet, not really knowing what to say. It\u2019s obvious as to what Keith\u2019s referring to.\n\nThe shooting.\n\nLance had a lot of terrible dreams involving that incident as well, and he wasn\u2019t even there to witness it. He cannot even begin to imagine how bad it must've been for Keith.\nThe other resumes tying the shoes. With a tortured groan, Lance peels himself away from the sweet, sweet soft bag and kisses his hard-earned rest goodbye. He blindly searches for his dark blue hoodie and sweats. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you then.\u201d\nKeith straightens his back. The measly light coming from his phone flickers out and dies down completely, so Lance doesn\u2019t get to see his reaction. He can still make out Keith\u2019s fit figure illuminated by the faint orange light coming from the street below, spilling through the spacious windows.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nLance has expected a lot of replies, most of them of rude variety, so this one catches him a little off-guard.\nHe shrugs, then realizes that the other can\u2019t see him doing so, his figure enshrouded in dark. Instead, he starts pulling on the hoodie. \u201cWhy not? I\u2019m gonna feel bad if I let you roam around all alone. B-Besides, this is our routine. It\u2019d be pretty assholish of me if I let you do all the work.\u201d Smooth save.\nKeith stays silent, but when he speaks again, his voice is back to normal. \u201cYou\u2019ll only have yourself to blame when I kick you awake at 8 am.\u201d\nLance scoffs and rises, legs aching a little. \u201cOh please, if this is your strategy to get rid of me, it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d\n\u201cI know. I tried.\u201d Keith huffs with exaggerated irritation and goes to the curtains. \u201cYou\u2019re just too sticky.\u201d\n\u201cThey call me \u2018The Glue\u2019 for a reason.\u201d\n\u201cOne, awful reference. Two, didn\u2019t they call you \u2018The Tailor\u2019 or something?\u201d\n\u201cMy references are great, and at least now I know that you were actually listening to me!\u201d\n\u201cWas not.\u201d\n\u201cWas too. Too late to bullshit your way out of this one.\u201d\nKeith blindly presses a finger to Lance\u2019s dry lips. The brunet takes it as his queue to shut the fuck up when the instructor peels away the curtain. Lance follows in tow, his hand chasing the lingering sensation of a cool touch against his mouth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf this is your strategy to get rid of me, oh boy, is it working!\u201d Lance whines and cautiously looks around the dingy hallway, quickly dodging a hanging cobweb. Gross. Keith is a few paces ahead, climbing up the creaking staircase with an obvious goal in mind. \u201cAre you sure that we can go there? Last time Allura caught me trying to break in and it didn\u2019t end well.\u201d Apparently, the rooftop's been closed off to everyone except for a few janitors and some chosen people. Something involving unfortunate incidents and a suicide, or so he was told. 'Just to be safe', said Allura\u2019s late father and locked the only entrance leading to the roof forever.\nThe forbidden entrance that Lance was about to defile for the second time in his life.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re too scared, you\u2019re free to go back,\u201d Keith offers, twisting the heavy keys on his index finger. He shoots Lance a curious look as if to see what sort of impression those words have left on the brunet.\nLance halts in his step, staring at the keys. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get those?\u201d\nKeith catches the rusted metal ring. \u201cI borrowed them.\u201d\nOkay, now he's certain that they shouldn't be here. \u201cOh my god, you criminal. Did you steal them from Allura!?\u201d\n\u201cBorrowed, Lance. I\u2019m going to return them once I\u2019m done and she won\u2019t even notice that they were gone to begin with.\u201d The black-haired man pulls out the board bolting the door shut and shoves one of the keys into a rusted lock. \u201cI did this yesterday and nothing happened. So are you going to keep on whining or will you trust my authority even if they do manage to catch us?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019ve got an awful personality,\u201d Lance mumbles under his breath, rubbing his arms when a cool gust of wind spills into the hallway. The metal door opens with a loud clang. \u201cYou might want to invest some time into rebuilding yourself as a person so that your looks can match your \u2013 whoa.\u201c\nThe sight that greets Lance is absolutely breath-taking. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re that high up, but the school is still located in the most beautiful part of the city, overlooking the main street of the city center. Multiple billboards and streetlights momentarily blind Lance and he trudges to the chain-link fence, pushing his fingers through the rusty metal. He\u2019s always wanted to get up here and just... laze around. Maybe look at the stars, but the light pollution looming in the sky ruins those dreams far too easily. Tonight it is swarmed by heavy black clouds, hanging low. Lance has no doubt in mind that it\u2019s going to rain soon.\nKeith\u2019s by his side, scrolling down his endless playlist, searching. Lance takes a moment to ogle his pale, pretty face, heart swelling in a very satisfactory way.\n\u201cPretty neat, huh?\u201d Keith questions as though he can feel Lance\u2019s burning gaze, finger stilling when he reaches the \u2018B\u2019 on the list.\n\u201cYou sure are,\u201d the taller man whispers, cheeks pink.\nKeith raises his head, the wind ruffling his long hair. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI said that it is!\u201d Lance\u00a0barks, embarrassed, and swipes a hand towards Keith\u2019s phone. \u201cNow give me that! I\u2019ll be your DJ and you can impress me with complicated choreo.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t wait for Keith\u2019s reply, only stalks to the wall and climbs a mess of fat pipes, perching on the highest one, living up to his \u2018Cat Man\u2019 nickname that earned him plenty of hospital visits in the past.\nLance\u2019s gaze drifts to the swirling abyss of blacks and oranges, but Keith\u2019s voice is sharp enough to bring him back down to the vacated rooftop. \u201cAnytime tonight?\u201d\nLance obeys, presses play, and observes while Keith tries to freestyle, moves a little too stiff, obviously out of his element. His choices are pretty good, though, Lance decides, when Keith does that trademark dip but somehow it\u2019s less sensual and more energetic.\nSomehow it\u2019s a reflection of Lance\u2019s bouncier style.\nHe can see that the other is trying hard to incorporate moves that'll be easier for Lance to execute. He stops thirty-something seconds into their version of the song, tapping at his chin while Beyonc\u00e9 drones on about baby boys in the background.\nLance hops down from his seat. \u201cS\u2019up?\u201d\nKeith scoffs, rubbing at his eyes. Despite that big talk, he seems beyond tired. \u201cThis isn\u2019t new to me, Lance. I\u2019ve already worked on a set for this song.\u201d\nLance is at a loss as to what he should say to that. He has to bite his tongue before he can call out bullshit. Keith never danced to this song, he would know. He\u2019s never seen any sneak peeks, vids, or live versions of it at any of the dance competitions.\n\u201cAnd your point is\u2026?\u201d Lance asks, halting the song.\n\u201cThe ending of it is a little... I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be okay with it. You should come up with one - it\u2019s our thing now.\u201d The way he says it sounds like bitter defeat. Lance feels his heart plummeting to his heels at the instructor\u2019s tone. Obviously, the other doesn\u2019t want any extreme changes, or so it seems.\n\u201cShow me what comes next and we can decide afterwards?\u201d Lance offers, voice strained.\nThey argue about it until Keith finally relents, too worn down to make compelling arguments. He rubs at his naked biceps and blows away a strand of hair that keeps brushing against his nose. \u201cHow do you feel about jump catches?\u201d Keith sounds thoroughly embarrassed just voicing it out and it takes a moment for the brunet to find his voice.\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d he croaks, blinking.\nKeith\u2019s back rests against the fence\u00a0with a loud rattle. \u201cUgh, forget it. It\u2019s probably not a thing for this sort of audience either way.\u201d\nLance joins the other. \u201cHey, man, if there\u2019s one thing that we\u2019ve learned today, it's fuck audience. Just show me. If I don\u2019t fuck it up, I\u2019m up for it. Or down, whichever position you\u2019ll put me in.\u201d He wiggles his eyebrows. Keith knocks a foot against the side of Lance\u2019s ankle. He then takes the phone and they spend a few minutes discussing certain parts of the song and what they could pull.\n\u201cAnd then at \u2018I see you in my dreams\u2019, we do that catch and end it. We don\u2019t really have the time to do much else, plus, we\u2019ll fit into the limit perfectly.\u201d\nLance screams internally, but his face is devoid of that emotion in particular. \u201cSo\u2026 a demonstration, if you may.\u201d\nKeith shifts his weight nervously, plucking at the material of his sweatpants. \u201cUh, okay, we'll still have to improvise some moves before that, but let\u2019s try it how I imagine it for now.\u201c He then places his hands on Lance\u2019s upper arms, his hold icy-cold, and pulls him away from the fence where there\u2019s more room. \u201cI\u2019m gonna run towards you and you just... Try to catch me right on the beat and spin me before the sentence is over. For now, try spinning me a few times in a row, we\u2019ll see how many we can cram into the time limit later.\u201d\nLance\u2019s throat is tight with nerves and excitement, heart pounding. His mind travels back to Hunk\u2019s message about 'Dirty Dancing' lifts, and he can no longer believe that this is his life.\nKeith takes a few uncertain steps back. Lance tries not to drop the other's phone while resuming the song, waiting for that perfect moment.\nThe song comes out a little muffled by the pocket of his hoodie. Lance\u2019s so focused on the soft bob of Keith\u2019s head and his mouth silently counting down that he\u2019s immediately startled when Keith runs into his arms in a high leap. The catch is so bad that they nearly fall, Lance\u2019s grip on his sides slipping.\n\u201cOkay, that was terrible,\u201d Keith whispers against Lance\u2019s ear when both of his feet are firmly planted on the ground. He\u2019s breathing a bit heavily, and for some strange reason, Lance isn\u2019t in a much better condition. It\u2019s probably because they almost fell to the cold, hard pavement, that\u2019s gotta be it. It\u2019s only relief, right?\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Keith commands.\nLance works on the phone.\nThe second time is less horrible. Lance manages to spin him, but the grip is uncomfortable, awkward, for the lack of a better word. Keith wraps an ankle around his shin almost painfully. It\u2019s probably going to bruise.\nThe third time \u2013 after Keith explains how the leg thing works and how it gives him not only a good sense of balance but also looks nice \u2013 is messy once again because Lance feels his fingertips brush over the skin under Keith\u2019s oversized shirt and he lets go instinctively, surprised. Keith seems rather annoyed by that one.\nThe fourth time they finally fall because Keith comes at him a beat too early.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t working out,\u201d Lance wheezes, rubbing at the back of his bruised head. Keith\u2019s awkwardly meshed against his torso but both of them are far too frustrated to pay attention to this sudden proximity. \u201cI\u2019m trying, though. Maybe we\u2019ll get it right after a few more attempts?\u201d\nKeith only wipes his skinned palms on his pants, hissing a little at the sting. \u201cTime to switch.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cYou know how it works by now, so come at me.\u201d Keith offers a good hand to help him stand. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re the kind of guy who needs a hands-on experience to learn this sort of stuff? Guess we\u2019ll find out.\u201d\nLance\u2019s grateful that his tender foot isn\u2019t acting up after this uncomfortable fall. He looks up at Keith, who seems more than ready to spin him as though they just got married. He rolls back his sleeves. \u201cNo music?\u201d\n\u201cJust do it, I wanna see if you can hold up fine.\u201d The instructor wiggles his fingers a little. With a pout, Lance crosses that small distance, and hops into Keith\u2019s waiting arms, comfortably hooking his entire leg around the black-haired man\u2019s firm thigh instead of settling for a foot only.\nThe world turns into a blur of orange and white hues. Lance risks a glance at Keith\u2019s focused face.\nTheir eyes meet and that strange electricity returns.\nKeith spins him around more than necessary but they don\u2019t mind it, getting dizzy, chests constricting. Lance fixes his grip on Keith, and the small, subtle action probably rings some alarms in the other\u2019s head because those cursed violet eyes widen significantly. Lance feels his partner's arms tightening around his torso in retaliation.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to dip you now,\u201d Keith says in an airy voice.\nLance is thrown for a loop.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to what!?\u201d he manages to squeak out, but then the world tilts, and his legs awkwardly flail, Keith\u2019s arms tight around his waist. His face is too damn close, the brunet panics, immediately letting go of those strong shoulders, palms covering his eyes instead.\nHe expects to fall down, but Keith continues holding onto him like he weighs no more than three grapes and a feather combines. With ease, he lowers him some more.\nIn a completely unexpected twist of events, the high heavens above start crying tears of secondhand embarrassment for Lance\u2019s smitten ass. Keith actually snorts when the cold, strong rain starts soaking his black shirt.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Lance squeaks out through the gap between his palms, spreading his fingers to peek at Keith\u2019s grinning face. God, this is so embarrassing.\n\u201cJust\u2026 this whole scenario?\u201d the instructor laughs. Lance feels himself pulled a few centimeters away from the ground. \u201cWe\u2019re at a forbidden territory at 3:30 am and I\u2019m dipping you in the rain.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so honest,\u201d Lance mumbles ashamedly, disentangling from the other\u2019s steel-like arms, flopping down on his ass. \u201cWe should probably bail, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to let up anytime soon.\u201d\n\u201cAnd people call me a stick in the mud,\u201d Keith nearly chirps, enjoying the chilly splashes of raindrops against his heated face. Lance can still see him shiver as goosebumps rise along that porcelain skin.\n\u201cMore like you should start taking better care of yourself, oh Mr. Knight in shining armor.\u201d The brunet wastes no time in peeling off his hoodie and pushing it down over Keith\u2019s head. He pulls on its ends until he\u2019s greeted by two violet eyes, blinking adorably. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna catch a cold,\u201d Lance lamely explains, smacking Keith\u2019s back before heading towards the entrance. The rain picks up in intensity. \u201cAt least you aren\u2019t wearing a crop top, I imagine you\u2019d have a bruised back and pneumonia by now.\nKeith\u2019s swimming in Lance\u2019s hoodie, sleeves a tad too long. The back of his head hits the wall when he sighs, drowsy. Lance tries to avoid staring at the graceful arc of his lean throat, the light bob of his Adam\u2019s apple.\n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly actively teaching right now, so there\u2019s no point in it. Plus, the pneumonia thing, I guess.\u201d\nLance turns his head slightly to face his companion better. \u201cSo it isn\u2019t some fashion statement? What a shocker.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about fashion.\u201d Keith chooses to ignore Lance\u2019s snippy \u2018Clearly\u2019. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good thing to wear while you\u2019re dancing. It\u2019s pretty comfortable and my students can actually see the movements that I make with my torso.\u201d He taps one finger against his hips, drawing a line to the ribcage. \u201cIf you\u2019re teaching, long and oversized shirts are really inconvenient because they get in the way and obscure too much.\u201d\nIt takes a moment for Lance to realize that they\u2019re getting to know each other. He's always thought of Keith as some sexy menace trying to make everyone question themselves, but he\u2019s just a guy with a job he doesn\u2019t really like nor dislike, sassier than Lance had given him credit for, and actually nice when treated with kindness. Now that Lance thinks about it more carefully, he is like an orange. You have to peel off ten layers of jackassery and douchebaggery to get to the juicy part.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like asking why you dance with a snapback.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just cool,\u201d Lance answers in a heartbeat, shrugging. Shiro used to dance with one too and incorporated it into his awesome tricks, but Keith doesn\u2019t need to know that.\nThe instructor looks thoroughly unimpressed. Lance grabs at his chest, wounded. \u201cAre you doubting me!?\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d he replies in a very doubting tone. \u201cWhy would I ever doubt that being a douchebag is seen as cool nowadays?\u201d\n\u201cWhoa there, gramps, what\u2019s that about snapbacks being douchey?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever been to a serious dance competition, you\u00a0should know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to plenty and I\u2019ve seen none of these people that you just described.\u201d\n\u201cSo you finally admit that you\u2019re involved in my world?\u201d Keith turns to him with a sly grin.\nLance wants to smash his head against a wall. Desperately.\nHe chooses to ignore the blatant attempt to extract more information regarding his background. Keith keeps prying and probing, playing mind games and whatnot. \u201cSo you\u2019ve only met douches in snapbacks?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m afraid so.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026 nice douches?\u201d Lance asks, trying not to sound too hopeful. He probably fails because Keith\u2019s smile only grows. He looks like that cat meme with the knife that Pidge adores so much.\n\u201cNot a single one.\u201d\n\nOuch, right to the pride.\n\n\u201cThough I remember this one guy who at least somewhat knew how to impress. Real flashy, very fun to mess with. Don\u2019t really remember who he was, though. Never saw him again.\u201d Keith shrugs, inspecting his palms.\nLance tries very hard not to go into questioning mode. Was he tall, dark, and handsome? Neon blue? Team Voltron? Goes by the name 'Blue'? Real name Lance? Lance McClain? Currently sitting next to you? Asking you these dumb questions? Marry me, please?\nWait, one of these things is not like the others.\nLance tries to laugh it off, nervous sweat gathering at his temples. \u201cMust\u2019ve been quite the guy if he managed to impress you. \u201c\n\u201cI was so impressed that I swoon whenever I remember him,\u201d Keith deadpans, face stone-like.\nLance squints, just in case. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Now let\u2019s go before you\u2019re the one catching a cold.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBy the time they get to their sleeping chambers, it\u2019s a little past 4 am. Keith turns on the flashlight in his phone and quietly peels off the baggy pants while Lance gathers his shit, pushing his beanbag chair to Keith\u2019s.\nHis companion stops toweling at that perfect, slightly damp hair, and stares at Lance, who only shoves his feet into fluffy socks.\n\u201cUh, what?\u201d the brunet questions, folding his long legs. Watching Keith intently.\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Lance?\u201d Keith sighs and sneezes. It sounds adorable. Lance has to bite his lower lip to stop himself from cooing and stepping on the other\u2019s pride. On any other occasion, he would\u2019ve jabbed at it like there was no tomorrow, but somehow he no longer feels that insane urge to do so.\n\u201cYou mentioned that you have insomnia, right? Well, Pidge says that they sleep better whenever they get to chat with another human being before going to bed. Stimulates the brain in a positive way or something. Pidge explained it to me in big scientific terms. Not too sure what half of them meant\u2026 but the main point is that it\u2019s good for you, ok! So sleepover time!\u201d Lance happily props his head against a curled palm, staring at Keith expectantly, who only fiddles with the hem of his shorts.\nHe looks like he wants to say something but can\u2019t voice it out, so Lance takes away his phone in an attempt to turn off the small ray of white light, just so that the other can get more comfortable. Maybe he\u2019s shy like that!\nLance turns over the sleek red device in his hand and swipes at the screen, the words \u2018Hey, what\u2019s your lockscreen passcode?\u2019 dying on the tip of his tongue when he sees Keith\u2019s wallpaper.\nThe instructor\u2019s eyes widen as he lunges for the phone, but Lance grew up surrounded by siblings, so taking things from him is no easy task.\n\u201cLance, give it to me!\u201d Keith nearly begs, but Lance pushes him back by the head and holds the phone far out of Keith\u2019s reach, inspecting the wallpaper. Keith settles for punching him in the ribs. \u201cGive me back my phone!\u201d\n\u201cOuch!\u201d Lance whines and tries to rub at the fresh bruise, but holding down Keith, even for a second, is a difficult task to accomplish. \u201cI love your wallpaper, dude!\u201d\n\u201cAre you making fun of me?\u201d the wriggling menace hisses lowly, looking pretty pissed off, face tinted a dangerous shade of maroon.\nLance only blows a raspberry. \u201cHell no! I love \u201cAdventure Time\u201d to death, man! Hunk does, too, obviously, he got me into it. He\u2019s the Jake to my Finn.\u201d Lance laughs. All at once, Keith stops struggling, one cheek pressed into Lance\u2019s ribs, eyes wide. Lance seriously loves that Lady Rainicorn lockscreen, it\u2019s amazingly well done. \u201cHave you taken a good look at my shirt, man? I know it\u2019s faded as hell by now, but still.\u201d He shines the faint light onto the sleeping shirt, pointing at Jake.\nKeith sits up and stares at Lance\u2019s shirt with a sort of innocent curiosity shining in his eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t noticed it in the dark. It\u2019s nice.\u201d\nLance nearly bounces on the sleeping bag. Now this is a quality sleepover conversation starter. \u201cIf you dig the shirt, check this.\u201d He rolls up the sweatpants and lifts his leg. On his left shin, there\u2019s a small tattoo of Finn, brandishing his sword.\nKeith produces something akin to a soft gasp, probing at the blue patch of ink of Finn\u2019s shirt. Lance smiles a little at the other\u2019s curiosity. \u201cPidge has Beemo and Hunk has Jake. It was kind of a dare that I lost, but they went to the tatt parlor with me either way. Hunk totally cried!\u201d So did Lance, maybe twice as much, but it was worth it in the end.\nThere\u2019s a ghost of a smile on Keith\u2019s lips. \u201cShiro and I used to watch it every morning. He really liked PB and said that I was a complete Marceline. I think he was too kind, I\u2019m a total Gunther when I think about it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re more of a Marshall Lee,\u201d Lance snorts and lets the material drop down. \u201cGod, I loved Fionna. She was so badass. Maybe someday I\u2019ll get her tattooed on the other leg.\u201d\nThey spend the next twenty minutes discussing their favorite characters and episodes. Lance drops the bomb that he\u2019s been saving up. \u201cSo Pidge tells me that I can totally rock that Jeremy Shada voice.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s eyebrows raise a little, amused. \u201cCan you now?\u201d\n\u201cYeah! I mean I may not sound like the perfect Finn, but I can try. Wait, let me think of some quotes.\u201d The brunet rakes his mind for something appropriate when the perfect one surfaces in his head.\nHe clears his voice a few times, makes sure to sound a little younger, and shuffles around until he faces Keith properly, their knees touching.\nThe black-haired man leans in a little, holding his breath in anticipation, waiting for Lance to work his magic. \u201cI like you. I think I\u2026 I think I like, like you,\u201d he says in his best Finn voice. Keith\u2019s eyes widen a little. Lance can see his stunned face tinting a bright shade of pink, the hue becoming more saturated with every word leaving Lance's mouth.\nHe goes over his tirade, his own cheeks feeling a bit too hot for comfort. It seems that he is starting to spill some honest feelings in there, getting far too comfortable.\n\u201cH-How was it?\u201d Lance asks and looks away, face positively aflame.\nFor a moment, Keith is quiet. Probably admiring his sick voice acting skills, yeah. It has to be that. \u201cI\u2026 You actually sound just like him, though I\u2019m pretty sure that it doesn\u2019t go like \u2018Sit on the couch with you and dance with you all the time\u2019.\u201d\nLance doesn\u2019t dare to look up. Somehow he knows that Keith isn\u2019t looking at him either, covering his mouth.\nHe runs his fingertips over the soft surface of the planet-adorned sleeping bag. \u201cNext time, I\u2019ll show you some song covers that I did. The records are pretty old and my uke skills aren\u2019t top-notch, but... Uh, it\u2019s kinda late, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Lance cuts in and drops onto the covers, quickly shoving his feet into the sleeping bag. He gives up on it once he realizes that it\u2019s way too hot for it either way.\n\u201cMhh, yeah, you\u2019re right. We should sleep now. Goodnight.\u201d Keith says in a single breath and copies his pupil's actions. The light goes out.\nLance crashes immediately whereas Keith tosses and turns for the remainder of the night, watching the sun rise over the tall buildings, his mind working overtime.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMornin\u2019.\u201d Keith yawns into his sleeve and takes the steaming cup of Starbucks coffee from Shiro\u2019s hand.\nShiro says nothing. The black-haired man raises an eyebrow.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nNo one points out that he\u2019s still wearing Lance\u2019s hoodie.\nPidge returns with Hunk and a box of steaming cupcakes at 11:30 am.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re actually asking me to send you those ancient Rebecca Sugar song covers,\u201d Pidge hisses lowly into his ear as they type away at their phone. \u201cJust how bad are you down for this guy? Didn\u2019t you say that playing for others is something that pansies who can\u2019t get laid do?\u201d\n\u201cLook, times have changed. I really, really need you to do this for me. I\u2019ve got a boy to impress.\u201d Lance stretches out the kinks plaguing his muscles and fixes his messy hair in the mirror. Pidge catches his gaze on the surface, looking a little skeptical. \u201cHe is the One. He is the Flame Prince\u2026ss to my Finn, man.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I can clearly see that everything\u2019s changed. You haven\u2019t logged into the chat for more than ten hours now. This is some serious shit. Almost missed all of your liveblogs.\u201d\n\u201cDo not summon me, Pidgey, or you\u2019ll regret it and end up rage-quitting the chat or something. Again.\u201d Lance presses his palms against their cheeks, turning their head in the direction of Hunk and Keith, who are animatedly talking about something. \u201cLook at them bonding. Keith\u2019s stealing my bear bro away.\u201d\n\u201cI think that your bear boo is actually being stolen by that tall friend of yours.\u201d Pidge bats his prying fingers away and stands on their tiptoes, pointing at Shay. She is shyly eyeing Hunk, getting some choice warm gazes in return. What a smooth operator.\u00a0Lance is proud.\n\u201cI can get behind this. They\u2019d be a total power couple.\u201d Lance shrugs, pushing Pidge in Keith\u2019s direction. \"Now you go over there and make sure that Hunk doesn\u2019t start quoting my diary entries to him.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much to quote other than that one entry where-\u201c\nLance's fingers return to their face, twice as strong. \u201cYou too!?\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hide your stuff for shit.\u201d\nLance toes Pidge\u2019s butt at that.\n\u00a0\nPidge stumbles in on Keith and Hunk\u2019s bonding moment right as Hunk finishes saying something related to RB \u2013 not a good thing to happen \u2013 and whips out the cupcakes.\nKeith smiles politely and is about to refuse, but Hunk only waves a finger in front of his face. \u201cDairy-free! A special vegan recipe that I found online.\u201d\nPidge almost wants to laugh at Keith\u2019s miffed expression. He blinks owlishly, gingerly accepting the gift that took an entire day for the taller man to make. \u201cUh, how\u2019d you find out my preferences?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Lance told me!\u201d Hunk chirps happily. Pidge should really step in, but they\u2019re far too entertained to bother. Hunk\u2019s face twists up with mock horror. \u201cWait, I wasn\u2019t supposed to say that. Don\u2019t tell Lance that I told you! Anyways, these were challenging to bake, but I tried my best. I\u2019d say that they came out pretty darn great, man.\u201d\nKeith takes a cupcake, going completely starry-eyed once the taste reaches his tongue. \u201cSo... Lance told you,\u201d he trails off, meaningful. Hunk nods eagerly. \u201cAnd how did he find out?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been huge fans of RB for years now!\u201d Hunk offers. Pidge tenses, ready to forcefully silence the other if he mentions something regarding Team Voltron, but Hunk\u2019s far too smart to do something like that. \u201cBut Lance is the biggest one. He took up dancing because he was extremely impressed by you guys.\u201d\n\u201cOh really\u2026\u201d Keith hums, lost in thought. He peers at Lance, who immediately pretends that he\u2019s checking himself out in the mirrors.\n\u201cHe\u2019s really happy to be here and that he got a chance to dance with you.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s face is carefully emotionless. In the blink of an eye, the aforementioned brunet materializes by their side, grip steel-like on his friends\u2019 shoulders.\n\u201cI see that you\u2019ve met Coop and Reemer,\u201d Lance grinds out through grit teeth, forcing a smile. \u201cBut they have to go now and take care of that other thing. Right, guys?\u201d\nHunk scrunches up his nose and says \u2018What thing?\u2019 at the same time Pidge bonks their head and says \u2018Ohhhh yeah, completely forgot about the thing!\u2019 in a cringey fake voice.\nThey disappear pretty damn fast.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d Pidge asks once they board the bus.\nHunk smiles mischievously. \u201cOh, just gave him a push in the right direction.\u201d\n\u201cLance\u2019ll kill you, you know?\u201d\n\u201cNah, he won\u2019t. He\u2019s never going to find out.\u201d\n\u201cPinky promise, bro,\u201d Pidge mutters, staring out the window. \u201cPinky promise, indeed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): Got you keiths digits ;0\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): whxt hte fck\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): Be nice to him dude he is a cinnamon roll wrapped up in cotton candy!!!\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain):are we seriously talking about the same guy here\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): Im serious, lance, play nice. keiths a good guy &gt;:o\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): its like i dont even know you anymore\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain) sent cryemoji.gif\n\n\nhunk back at it again stealing my baes\n\n\nno dont u log off\n\n\nthis isnt over!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): Yikes. Glad I sat this one out.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nKeith\u2019s performance isn\u2019t top-notch.\nHe hasn\u2019t slept, he\u2019s beyond tired, and his mind is left reeling after that mostly one-sided conversation with Hunk.\nHis outlook on Lance\u2026 well, who is he to lie and say that it hasn\u2019t changed completely.\nThat conversation has been an eye-opening experience, in a way. The kind-hearted man was straight to the point, no-nonsense, unlike Lance\u2019s other siblings. Hunk has thoroughly apologized for his friend\u2019s shitty behavior while scratching at the back of his neck, looking guilty for digging around sensitive topics.\n\u201cLook, I know that he can act like a horrendous tool, but he\u2019s a good guy. He doesn\u2019t mean it and he\u2019s only puffing up his plumage in order to impress you even if it\u2019s... the wrong way of doing it. He\u2019s always been fascinated by RB and the rumors regarding it, specifically your dancing. He honestly just wants to feel close to you and get a chance to shine. I\u2019ve seen how badly he took your duo's break up. I don\u2019t want to bring up any more painful memories for you, but I have to tell you this much: read between the lines when it comes to Lance. It\u2019s how everything goes with him and he\u2019s too full of himself to be honest in this type of situation. Anyways, I wish you luck, and now you gotta pretend that you didn\u2019t hear any of this.\u201d\nLooking at Lance practice in earnest like that with Hunk\u2019s words ringing in his head, well... It\u2019s something, to say the least.\nLance is still a cocky brat, that much he cannot deny, but even the cockiness seems to have some deeper meaning to it now. Which is really goddamn confusing, actually.\nIt also brings him back to the night before. Lance approached him after their massive fuckup turned into one of the best experiences in his stress-filled life, head bowed, and grin sheepish.\nShiro smiled in an encouraging way and nudged Keith in the other\u2019s direction, attention refocusing on the piles of papers and his fellow judges.\nLance sharply inhaled and looked into his eyes, determined sentences spilling out of his mouth like beans. \u201cLook, man, it\u2019s undeniable that we got off to a pretty rough start, and now that we have to cooperate\u2026 let me properly reintroduce myself. I\u2019m Lance McClain. My favorite pastimes are freestyling and TV shows. I like spicy food and space, also I\u2019m not as bad as I seem, I swear.\u201d\nKeith only stared at the other\u2019s extended, shaky hand, exhaling noisily before taking it. \u201cHello, Lance,\u201d he offered, uncertain how to react.\nLance snorted, of course. \u201cYou sound like we\u2019re at an AA meeting.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to say. I\u2019m not good with this stuff.\u201d\nLance had been so gentle with him then. \u201cSay whatever comes to your mind,\u201d he offered, eyes glimmering in the faded lights. Encouraging.\n\u201cKeith Kogane. Bad at coming up with facts about myself and, uh, I\u2019m a newbie dance instructor way in over his head. That good enough?\u201d\n\u201cSounds about right. Well, we can work on basics like this later on.\u201d\nBut work on them when and how? They barely had enough time to pull this dance together.\n\u201cKeithy-boy, I know that my hips are mesmerizing to watch and all, but I really need you to get over here and start working!\u201d Lance calls out, wiping his sweaty nose with the hem of a baggy shirt, tanned skin practically glowing.\nLance is a danger to his sanity.\n\u201cComing.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBy the evening, they end up throwing together more than half of their final dance and then end up dicking around instead of doing actual work. Lance doesn\u2019t let go of the hip joke until he gets a solid laugh from the other man.\n\u201cHips so fine they will never lie to you. They can even tell the future! Ask away. One shimmy for \u2018yes\u2019, two for \u2018no\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d Keith snorts while Lance innocently bats his long eyelashes, bumping his hips into Keith\u2019s.\nHis voice is thin when he warbles in a high-pitched tone. \"Ask us stuff, Keitttthhh\u2019.\"\nThey start jamming out to even more to Beyonc\u00e9 songs. Lance absolutely insists that they freestyle to 'Run the World (Girls)' and immediately regrets it when Keith executes it perfectly, but the \u2018perfection\u2019 lasts for about thirty seconds at most because they start exaggerating everything and making up dumb moves with excessive twirling, dancing together in a weird, on-the-spot bullshitted dance somewhat akin to a bizarre flamenco. They look like two \u201cgraceful\u201d cranes trying to mate for life or something along those lines, and no one dares to enter the room because of it.\nLance shakes his ass like it\u2019s the end of the world. Keith cracks up laughing at those exaggerated movements while trying to feign at least some level of seriousness, dramatically throwing one sleeve of Lance\u2019s hoodie over his shoulder as though it\u2019s a feathery boa. They begin posing in front of the mirror wall and making weird faces at the reflection. By the end of the five-song playlist, they\u2019re completely spent.\nLance gets up from the floor in a fancy flip, sliding forward, legs stretched before him to show off. It suddenly dawns on Keith that while he viciously tried to whip Lance into shape, he never actually learned anything in particular from the other. They\u2019ve decided on a varying routine that would combine their strengths, but the instructor is still left curious.\n\u201cTeach me that?\u201d he asks.\nLance's body goes frigid. \u201cYou want me to teach you bboying?\u201d he squeaks in a thin voice.\n\u201cIf that was bboying, it\u2019s pretty damn weak.\u201d\nLance huffs and crosses his arms. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll show you weak. Get ready to learn, Mr. Perfecto.\u201d\nAnd then they spend the next half an hour with Lance nearly getting off to the words \u2018On your heels, not toes, unless you wanna pull some muscles\u2019. Karma is a bitch, indeed.\nApparently, Keith kind of sucks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand?\u201d Lance wonders out loud as he watches Keith down on his knees, hands propped before him, nose scrunched up in concentration. He can do the flare\u2019s circle perfectly despite trying just a few times \u2013 a fast learner, how unexpected, insert sarcasm here \u2013 but when it comes to the kick-out \u2018V\u2019, he always drops down on his ass, unable to balance. \u201cI thought that you were an all-rounder like Shiro.\u201d\n\u201cWell, when it comes to breakdancing, Shiro\u2019s teaching methods are kind of\u2026 shit.\u201d Keith sticks out his tongue, shifting forward with his left hand, doing another perfect circle. Getting too confident he tries to flare again, only to screw it up. \u201cI learned how to do this much at least.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019d start with something less advanced, maybe you could do it. Power moves ain\u2019t easy. Pidge nearly lost it with me, multiple times. I was always good at step combos, though,\u201d Lance brags and goes over a basic top rock combo, bouncing lightly, effortlessly. It feels natural.\nKeith sits down thoroughly unimpressed, peeling off the damp shirt, and retying his hair into a ponytail. Lance makes a low gurgling sound. \u201cYou seem to\u2026 get along with your siblings,\u201d the instructor points out nonchalantly.\nLance kind of wants to laugh at that. All they\u2019ve been doing in front of Keith is constantly arguing and dissing each other. \u201cAh well, you know how it is. Siblings can be a real pain in the ass. You disagree on a lot of things and stuff, but at the end of the day, they\u2019re still family. You love them unconditionally nonetheless.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s quiet for a while. Lance almost expects him to not answer, but the other destroys his grip on reality as always. \u201cGuess I wouldn\u2019t know. Don\u2019t exactly have anyone who defines as family.\u201d\n\nOh.\n\nWell shit, way to be an asshole, McClain. No wonder Keith never mentioned any family members on his Twitter or any other social media sites.\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t say that. There\u2019s always Shiro. I think I\u2019d trade Em for him any day. Though I\u2019d miss her rants too much,\u201d Lance offers.\nKeith actually smiles at that, making the brunet\u2019s ribcage squeeze painfully.\n\u201cShiro\u2019s always been like family to me,\u201d he nods in confirmation.\nLance feels better, heaving a sigh of relief. \u201cSee? You have Shiro and you definitely have more people who care for you, like Pidge, Hunk, Em, and\u2026 me.\u201d\nHe barely gets to finish the sentence before the world goes dark. Keith pushes his snapback low over his eyes and turns away, rummaging through his stuff for a water bottle.\nThe back of his neck colors a deep red.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a tradition for the instructors to take one evening off to venture into the town in order to entertain themselves and get some well-deserved drinks. The evening is rainy, but the weather is rather nice. It's warm and no longer windy.\nKeith, being the newbie that he is, does not get these rights.\nHe doesn\u2019t really mind it, though, but he\u2019s not in a drinking mood either way.\nBut then there\u2019s Lance, who is not quite a member of this dance camp despite kind of being one, and the moment Allura lets it slip that she and Shiro are hitting some fancy restaurant, Lance barrels through the staff room\u2019s door, pinpointing Keith\u2019s white crop top and mullet immediately.\nHe patiently waits for him to stop teaching \u2013 nearly vibrating all the while, but still patient by Lance standards \u2013 and the moment Keith approaches him with a quirked eyebrow, ready to scold him for being a distraction, Lance grabs his cool hands.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get the fuck out of here,\u201d he sing-songs, eyes wide and sparkly.\nHe looks like a puppy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nKeith has a hard time saying no, especially when Lance gets whiny and pushy about it. Shiro gives the duo his blessings, saying that he\u2019ll cover for them, and warns them to not get too drunk.\n\u201cReturn before morning practice,\u201d Shiro says, handing his partner a spare key to the back entrance.\nAnd so, here they are, Lance and Keith, huddled close under the smallest umbrella imaginable, covered in black cartoonish kittens \u2013 note to self: buy Em a bigger one \u2013 on their way to what Lance swears to god is the best pub ever. And the perfect spot for a first date, he thinks giddily.\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, we could go to an arcade, but I\u2019m not in the mood for kicking your ass at DDR. Don\u2019t want your pride to get too crushed,\u201d Lance laughs. Keith steps on his foot in return.\nKeith\u2019s glad that he has brought a pair of jeans with him, along with boots. He\u2019s still left drowning in Shiro\u2019s at least three-sizes-too-big jacket. Meanwhile, Lance\u2019s just thankful that Pidge packed him a shirt that isn\u2019t old beyond belief or splashed in paint stains.\nDespite being pretty late and generally miserable, the streets are packed with plenty of people seeking entertainment.\nLance only hopes that there\u2019ll be enough space for them to chill at his fave place to hang.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little dingy, but it has a good vibe and even greater music, perfect for kicking back and relaxing. We go there every Tuesday for the karaoke night. It surely lives up to its name \u2013 a Gem among gems!\u201d Lance isn\u2019t one to be cooped up in the same place for too long, Keith can clearly see that now, as he lets the brunet rant his ear off about the awesome atmosphere and how the bartenders know who he is by now, along with the names of his orders.\nSeeing Lance in his natural habitat is undeniably fascinating. The brunet\u2019s no longer trying to douche it up and seems more than willing to have a good time with a wet blanket like Keith.\nKeith doesn\u2019t think too highly of himself, and neither does he think that he\u2019s interesting enough for a chatterbox like Lance, who always has to be in motion and showered in constant attention. Keith\u2019s more on the reserved side. He prefers to keep to himself, and it takes a whole lot of emotional bonding for him to be comfortable enough with showing his true emotions.\nNeedless to say, he enters the building feeling like an out-of-place rain-heavy cloud in the middle of a light blue sky.\nThe place is very relaxing in an odd way, all shiny dark brown wood panels and creamy walls, the lighting considerably bright. Soft swing music plays in the background as some couples dance away on the spacious dancefloor located at the center of the pub. The round tables are nearly packed, but it doesn\u2019t feel too crowded. Keith doesn\u2019t know whether that's normal, as he\u2019s not too keen on going to bars of any sort.\nHe and Lance settle by the long bar. Keith immediately orders a simple mineral water. Lance follows his example without a second thought.\n\u201cWhy not alcohol?\u201d he questions.\nLance shrugs, happy with his minty bubble water. \u201cNo ID on me, pal.\u201d At Keith\u2019s confused stare, he guffaws. \u201cPidge says that I look like I\u2019m twelve, can\u2019t risk it,\u201d he offers as an explanation, taking a sip.\n\u201cYou look old enough.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, I\u2019m old enough to not be a lawsuit. Besides, I\u2019m not going to leave you sipping on some overpriced Georgian water by yourself. It just wouldn\u2019t be cool if I had a beer and you had nothing. It\u2019s not how it works with me.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe I\u2019ll make the ultimate sacrifice of buying beer later tonight.\u201d Keith looks into the distance, observing the handful of couples swinging to the beat. The music is familiar, bringing back feelings of nostalgia to his heart. Long days spent at a rundown jazz joint, spinning around in circles and being spun around in return, kicking at air playfully.\nLance is on him in a heartbeat. \u201cOhhh, I know that look. That lindy hop music in your playlist was by no means a coincidence, right?\u201d\nKeith startles, choking on his water. His companion smacks him on the back a few times. \u201cDid you go over my entire playlist?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Jeez, you\u2019re so edgy. All that punk rock is astounding. Hard to believe that you shake your butt to Beyonc\u00e9 and Fifth Harmony.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t really shake anything to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. I used to jam out to it pretty hard, if you ask me. I think there are some embarrassing pics of me somewhere out there. Old Myspace account maybe.\u201d Lance pokes at an ice cube with his black straw, mindlessly fishing out a mint leaf. \u201cTime to tell me your mysterious backstory, Keith-boy, cause I have some stuff I wanna share as well.\u201d\nHis sigh isn\u2019t long-suffering enough. Bummer. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to back off until I tell you, are you?\u201d\n\u201cHmm\u2026 nope! We\u2019re having a bonding moment.\u201d\n\u201cOh, are we now? What do you expect me to do next? Cradle you in my arms?\u201d\n\u201cThat can be arranged, I think. But more on that later.\u201d Lance\u2019s blue eyes flicker to the dancefloor before he directs his best, million-watt grin at his companion. \u201cGo on.\u201d\nMight as well. \u201cTechnically, Shiro and I have met through lindy.\u201d\nIt\u2019s Lance\u2019s turn to choke. His eyes are impossibly wide when he croaks out, \u201cNo way!\u201d and hits his chest a few more times.\n\u201cYes way.\u201d Keith shrugs, leaning back on the unsteady bar stool, making it creak. \u201cHow else do you think he can work those step combinations with such perfection?\u201d\n\u201cStrangely enough, I can actually see him doing it,\u201d Lance murmurs into his hand, stroking his chin. It\u2019s not that hard to visualize Shiro dressed in semi-formal attire, going over the three-step combinations and swing-outs to this kind of music. He gives the instructor a critical eye. \u201cYou on the other hand? Not so much.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t really good at it. I\u2019ve been going down the hip-hop road my entire life.\u201d\n\u201cSo how\u2019d it happen? Two different styles like that?\u201d Lance looks at the huge leaves of a flourishing potted plant placed near the bar, bigger than him in height. Maybe there was truth in Coran\u2019s words. Perhaps, he and Keith are meant to be like this, learning from each other, cooperating. Just like Keith and Shiro, way before everything went downhill.\n\u201cMy guardian was good friends with Shiro\u2019s dad. That man was hardcore and has my utmost respect even to this day.\u201d Keith closes his eyes, a slight smile tugging on his lips. He seems to be drowning in fond memories. Lance tactfully stays quiet, observing, and drinking in this new information. \u201cHe owned a jazz joint, taught lindy hop classes, and worked part-time at the local farm. He was everywhere all at once, but he never complained about the workload. Shiro, naturally, took up lindy as well. He wanted to help his old man out.\u201d Keith remembers his partner, seventeen and overworked already, getting his first gray hairs, teaching kids whenever his dad fell ill or had other, more important business to attend to.\n\u201cThis is gospel truth and we all knew this already, but I gotta say it anyway - Shiro is a hero,\u201d Lance says, inspecting the sleeve of his parka. \u201cMy respect for him is off the charts.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy task. He didn\u2019t get anything out of this other than experience and a sense of satisfaction.\u201c The Shirogane family has always been well-off, but Shiro still worked himself late into the night for free, content knowing that he could be of help. \u201cI saw him dancing at that pub and noticed the raw potential. I tried recruiting him plenty of times. At the same time, he tried dragging me into swing hell. I was fourteen at the time. None of us succeeded until my guardian died.\u201d Keith sniffles, obviously not wanting to elaborate. \u201cI was all alone yet again. Shiro took it upon himself to act like my guardian. A week after the funeral he told me that he\u2019d quit lindy hop, ready to follow me.\u201d\nThe words \u2018That\u2019s sad\u2019 rest on the tip of Lance\u2019s tongue, but he doesn\u2019t know how to properly console someone in this situation. Shiro seems content enough with what he\u2019s doing even to this day, even despite those serious injuries. So does Keith.\nLance puts his chin into his hands, humming. \u201cYou probably can\u2019t see it right now, but I\u2019m actually completely starry-eyed because I was pretty damn involved in lindy hop as well. I guess I just felt like reconnecting with this side of me, which is why I brought you here. It\u2019s swing music night.\u201d Lance waves a hand to the center of the dancefloor, pretty vacant now that the song has changed. It isn\u2019t too fitting for dancing, with far too many dips in it to get a good grasp on the beat.\n\u201cSeems like we have a lot in common?\u201d Keith tries to keep his voice even and finishes up the drink.\n\u201cWeeeell, that\u2019s how bonding works. You get to find common grounds and then talk about them.\u201d Lance smacks his palms to the beat of the song against the bar. \u201cFor example, if we\u2019re getting back to the lindy hop thing, my dad was a big enthusiast back in the day, whereas my mom was a professional. He\u2019d go to the local pub and watch her dance, never daring to actually ask for a swing. Ma took it upon herself to ask Pa out after she got fed up with his staring. That\u2019s how they met. Guess my family members are just cursed to gravitate towards other dancers.\u201d Lance\u2019s face warms up significantly when he feels Keith\u2019s intent gaze burning holes into the side of his head.\nThe words are right on the tip of his tongue, nearly forcing themselves out. \u201cAre you also-\u201c\nThe song switches. Lance sits up straight, craning his neck and looking at the speakers. \u201cOh my god, I love this one!\u201d He hops off the chair, pulling off his parka to roll up the sleeves of his light blue button-down. Keith peers at him and uncrosses his legs.\nLance is in his personal space in 0.5 seconds. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, Keith, but I really feel like dancing right now!\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to be\u2026 resting tonight?\u201d The rest of the sentence is trailed off when Lance glances back at the dancefloor and waves a hand.\n\u201cPshaw, no, I\u2019m talking about lindy! Get up and let\u2019s go!\u201d\nViolet eyes blink rapidly. \u201cIt\u2019s been years. I don\u2019t remember the moves?\u201d\n\u201cDude, it\u2019s us. We\u2019ll improvise.\u201d Lance puffs out his chest and continues rushing him \u2013 god forbid the song ends before Keith pulls off Shiro\u2019s jacket from his shoulders.\nLance takes him by the hand and eagerly drags him along, with Keith nearly tripping over his feet. \u201cYou\u2019ll lead,\u201d the black-haired man huffs, a little embarrassed by the sudden attention that they\u2019re getting from all sides. \u201cI don\u2019t exactly remember any moves.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be like your jump catches. Just remember the follow\u2019s steps.\u201d Lance takes his left hand in an appropriate link and goes over the combination in a rushed blur of movement, hopping quickly. \u201cOne, two, one, two, three, and so on, got it? Don't forget to bend your knees, too!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t-\u201c\n\u201cPerfect!\u201d Lance yells and drags him to the center of the illuminated stage, walking backwards and facing Keith all the while, already going over the lead\u2019s step combos. Keith tries his hardest to keep up, staring at Lance\u2019s feet, trying to recall what was it exactly that Shiro had taught him all those years ago.\n\u201cImprovise, Keith!\u201d Lance says loudly over the jammy music, and grabs Keith\u2019s waist, making up moves as he goes. \u201cNo one\u2019s here to judge, keep your eyes on my face.\u201d\nKeith stumbles trying to do a rushed swing-out, but Lance only cackles. He finally decides to follow the other\u2019s advice, letting his body go on autopilot.\n\u201cIt\u2019s trueee! I wanna be like you!\u201d Lance sings along, turning in a sharp twist. Keith sees the opportunity for a spin, grip tight on Lance\u2019s shoulders when he kicks out his legs in that V meant for the flare, knees bending a little when Lance dips him easily enough, snorting. \u201cKing of bboying. You could nail that flare without any problems right now.\u201d\n\n'I wanna walk like you, talk like you-'\n\nLance spins their linked hands above Keith\u2019s head and the instructor twists around easily enough, doing the same to Lance too, easily retaking the lead, ignoring the move combinations, a light bounce to his step.\nLance\u2019s footwork is absolutely impeccable when it comes to lindy, but Keith doesn\u2019t pay any mind to it, far too focused on the amazing guy before him, not bothering to show off for once. Lance watches him closely, the grin never fading from his lips, hair messy and skin glowing.\nKeith can hear the blood rushing in his ears.\nIt doesn't take long before they\u2019re laughing and the happy, fast-paced Disney song switches to a new one, followed by another one.\nThey dance away until they\u2019re short on breath, and once they finally stop, wild applause from a few tables reaches the duo. Lance takes a few deep breaths and bows, shyly smiling at Keith and taking his hand, lacing their fingers together.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI had fun tonight,\u201d Keith says once they\u2019re on their way back to the school, the bus empty. Old southern music and the hum of the engine fill the sleepy silence. The digital numbers of the clock read 2:58 am. \u201cYou lived up to the \u2018not as bad as you seem\u2019 title.\u201d\n\u201cHey, if I was really that horrible to you, all you had to do was tell me to back off. I would have.\u201d\nSomehow, Keith feels like this isn\u2019t true. He snuggles into his jacket even further. It\u2019s a little cold.\nLance seemingly reads his mind. \u201cPerhaps not completely. You\u2019re kinda fun to mess with \u2013 ow! \u2013 but I would\u2019ve kept it under the wraps more\u2026ish.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t see a point in telling you off now that we\u2019re stuck together,\u201d Keith mumbles, getting a little sleepy, and wow, isn\u2019t that a first? Maybe that whole brain-stimulation nonsense actually works?\nLance stays uncharacteristically quiet until they reach their stop.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he says when Keith starts shuffling around, lazily getting up from his seat.\nIt\u2019s met with a quirked eyebrow. \u201cFor what?\u201d\n\u201cEverything.\u201d\nThey don\u2019t talk for the rest of the night.\n\u00a0\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): You actually took him out to Gem? And lindy hopped?\n\n\nAm I reading this right?\n\n\nThere\u2019s no way that this is real.\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): You know what they say, dude, kids tend to take after their parents\n\n\nThe history repeats itself!!\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): guys i dont see why u r making such a big deal out of this we literally just danced to some swingy jungle book osts\n\n\nsides i dont think he even liked it that much\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): oh he liked it alright ;)))))\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): OK THAT\u2019S IT BRO SPILL IT\n\n\ndid he say anything????????? did he fall for me???\n\n\nNO DO NOT LOG OFF\n\n\nHOW DARE\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): Dude, if you don\u2019t bring him back home for that promised dinner at this point, I will seriously disown you.\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): ok but like did hunk tell u anything about the keith thing\n\n\nNO NOT U TOO. I HATE THIS FAMILY AND I HATE THIS CHAT\n\n\nI HATE YOU GUYS WTF\n\n\n[10:11 am] Group chat name changed to: pray 4 lances dense ass\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain) has left the chat\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0PRIVATE: sirlancealot (Lance McClain): please let me back in i cant live without my daily dose of memes\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nLance takes it upon himself to come up with at least some exclusive moves that could fill in the gaps left behind in their dance routine. He and Keith have been going over this as a team, but Keith\u2019s part is undeniably bigger, and that\u2019s just not right. They need to divide it at least a little more evenly to prove to the judges that they know what they're doing. Well, not really, in Lance\u2019s case, at least.\nThe moment he kicks Keith out for a veeeery long water break, he goes over a few breakdancing power moves. \u201cNah, too intense for this song.\u201d\nThen a few drops. \u201cNope, it\u2019s gonna look weird.\u201d\nAnd then a brilliant idea surfaces in his clouded brain, momentarily distracting the three monkeys piloting his body. Shit, he's a genius. Someone give him a medal. They\u2019re going to kill it on the stage.\n\u201cOh-kayyy,\u201d Lance hums and fixes the snapback, pushing it back. \u201cI can use this.\u201d\nHe listens to the song a few more times and chooses the best timing, freestyling awkwardly, trying to combine some ideas.\n\n18\u202620\u202624.\n\nThirty seconds. Perfect.\nLance whips out his good old workout playlist, scrolling down the infinite list filled with his favorite lady singers right until he finds the song that he needs, lowering the volume just in case.\n\u2018Make it shake\u2019 rings too damn familiar, setting his body to motion without a single beat of hesitation. He doesn\u2019t really remember the last time he danced to it. Certainly, he tried to after that incident at the \u2018Black Lion\u2019? However, the memory of it is so blurry that he can no longer recall anything. Lance does remember the blinding frustration, the resounding words.\n\nNever again.\n\nHe crosses his arms in front of his chest, keeping them parallel to his collarbones, weight shifting from one foot to another in a smooth wave. The move flows easily enough. Still got it!\nHe can definitely use it, it\u2019s just too damn fitting for this routine. He can also incorporate some of Keith\u2019s choice moves as well, bringing back that vivid memory from a year ago, keeping it alive.\nMaybe Keith will actually remember him this time? It\u2019s a scary thought, but it\u2019s one that he entertains every now and then. He desperately wants a repeat of that masquerade, especially now that he knows that it\u2019s bound to go differently.\nUnless Keith\u2019s opinion of him is going to change the moment he finds out that Lance is that mystery douchebag in a snapback. He certainly fucked himself over with this one, hasn\u2019t he?\nLance continues practicing, shedding his sweaty shirt and going over a variety of combinations, the time limit kind of scaring him. Keith has placed his trust in him and he isn\u2019t about to betray it a second time.\n\u00a0\nAt the same time, Keith lurks just out of sight, frozen stiff. At this point, he must look like an impressively realistic statue carved from ice.\n\nWait a minute.\n\nHe's pretty sure that he recognizes these moves, this song. No, scratch that \u2013 he definitely does. And if these faded memories fail him, that snapback certainly doesn\u2019t.\nKnees weak, he slides down the wall and closes his eyes, the heavy curtain keeping him hidden.\nWell. This makes a whole lot more sense now. Especially that strange dream, starring a hot stranger at a nameless nightclub, dressed in neon blues, all long tan limbs, and\u2026 Lance\u2019s confident voice.\nTalk about fate and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, huh?\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Keith exhales to the point there\u2019s no more breath left in his constricting lungs. \u201cPlayed me like nobody\u2019s business.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n&gt;&gt; Hunk G.\n\n\nCan I ask for a small favor?\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Cinnamon roll\n\n\nAsk away!!! ; )\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Hunk G.\n\n\nI know this is going to sound a little weird but could you \u2013\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHunk snorts and whips out his chem kit.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYooo, Keith! Uh, how long have you been standing there?\u201d\nHe\u2019s nervous. Good.\n\u201cI just got here. Let\u2019s continue.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWorking together with Lance and switching up the vital parts of this choreography makes Keith\u2019s patience thin out rapidly, especially considering the fact that he isn\u2019t much for socializing and he\u2019s been surrounded by people for four days now. Four long, grueling days.\nHe and Lance agree on a lot of things but Keith\u2019s hard-ass attitude is hard to change in the span of a few days, especially when he remembers just how important this song is to him.\nHis last song, their last song. Before the shooting, before everything they\u2019ve ever worked for got set aflame, one last dance that's never been practiced. It was Keith\u2019s first attempt to do something for Shiro for once instead of constantly relying on the older man, asking for advice on the moves and incorporating them into their routines.\nAnd now this thing with Lance, it\u2019s throwing off his game completely. Needless to say, the dance instructor doesn\u2019t appreciate it.\n\u201cLook, what\u2019s got your panties in a twist?\u201d Lance finally snaps a few hours later, eyebrow twitching. He\u2019s worn out and looks like the devil himself. He has pretty much no time to chill and fix his appearance, and damn, how could he forget this one tiny, insignificant detail \u2013 they\u2019re really goddamn pressed for time. \u201cLet\u2019s just go over it one last time and take a break before you decide to go \u2018homicide mode\u2019.\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny, McClain,\u201d Keith snaps, pushing messy strands of hair away from his burning eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t try to bullshit your way out of this. We don\u2019t have much time left.\u201d\n\u201cJeez, man, I was kidding.\u201d\n\u201cAnd as I said, not funny. Just do your goddamn part without complaining for once, okay!? I\u2019m not here to babysit you through this one.\u201d Irritated, Keith takes a swig from a water bottle and glares some lingering people away. They scurry away immediately, scared. \u201cThis\u2019d be so much easier if we had left it how I designed it. Shiro wouldn\u2019t complain. Take him as an example if you want to keep up with me.\u201d\nThe insensitive, hurtful words slip away before he can try to hold them in, but Keith\u2019s way too pissy. Perhaps a small, petty part of him wants for them to sting, wants to take out his frustrations on Lance\u2019s poor, unsuspecting head.\nThe brunet\u2019s shoulders sag at that, his mouth hanging open. He looks like a sopping wet dog who got kicked out into a thunderstorm, eyebrows furrowed lightly.\nLance takes in a steadying, shuddering breath, inspecting the floor as though it\u2019s the most amazing, interesting thing out there. As though it has a valid explanation for Keith\u2019s horrendous behavior. He doesn\u2019t even bother to fake a smile, only sighing out a defeated \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m not Shiro.\u201d\nHe quickly gathers his belongings and leaves.\nKeith wants to punch the mirror until it shatters. This is low, even for him.\n\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with me\u2026?\u201d he groans once he's alone, running a shaky hand over his face.\n\u00a0\nEm glares at him as though she wants to set his mullet on fire, peach-pink lips thinned out.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Lance?\u201d Keith asks tentatively, feeling himself shrivel under the short girl\u2019s intense gaze.\nEm eyes him warily, as though she\u2019s considering whether she should answer the question or tell him to go fuck himself. Her shoulders drop when she deems Keith\u2019s appearance guilt-riddled enough for her liking. \u201cThird floor, I think. It\u2019s not a good idea to seek him out right now,\u201d she mumbles, voice tinged with sadness on her brother\u2019s behalf.\nHe\u2019s in the wrong here. He knows it. \u201cThank you anyway.\u201d\nThe girl huffs, suddenly pissed off. \u201cLance likes you a lot, you know. If you hurt his feelings, I\u2019ll hurt you,\u201d she threatens, snappy.\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d\nEm kicks his shin. Pretty hard. \u201cApologize to him, don\u2019t be a dick.\u201d\nWell, if Lance wants to kill him for seeking him out, at least he can chalk it up to the extremely intimidating sister, glaring at him as though she wants to see his kidneys get pecked out by a flock of ravens.\nShiro seems just as disappointed with him, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. He stands behind Em and stares his partner down until the other rounds a corner.\n\u00a0\nKeith only truly dares to seek out the brunet a few hours later, with only six hours remaining until the final review.\nTrue to his younger sibling\u2019s words, Keith finds Lance in the third-floor hall, which is, naturally, off-limits, but keeping the other away is impossible. Keith tries to keep his steps as light as possible, ready to check on the other first and only then assess whether he should give it a few extra hours. Hours that they don\u2019t have.\nKeith doesn\u2019t have the time to do any once-overs because he finds Lance curled up on the floor, rubbing at his ankle, banging a fist against the floor, and muffling curses whenever he probes at the injury too much.\nKeith\u2019s by his side in a heartbeat. \u201cAre you okay!?\u201d he falls to his knees next to his partner, hands hovering over the injured leg.\nLance recoils from him, wincing a little. His teeth painfully dig into his lower lip. \u201cPeachy!\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem peachy, more like \u2018lemony\u2019. Let me take a look!\u201d Keith shakes his head. Now's really not the time. Besides, he is tired of reasoning with the other, as though he\u2019s some disobedient, petulant child in need of a scolding.\n\u201cHa ha. Hilarious,\u201d Lance groans through grit teeth, eyebrows furrowed. \u201cHere\u2019s a thought, Mullet - don\u2019t fucking touch me. I got this.\u201d Lance says, even though he clearly does not. He looks in serious need of some painkillers and elastic bandages.\n\u201cStop tossing around, you\u2019re hurting yourself more. Let me.\u201c He smacks away Lance\u2019s twitchy fingers, lightly probing the leg. It earns him a whimpering hiss. \u201cLooks like an old trauma with too much strain put on it.\u201d Keith glares. \u201cLet me guess. You locked yourself up and started overworking.\u201d\nLance\u2019s nostrils flare with indignation. He tries to slide out of Keith\u2019s reach. \u201cI\u2019m fine, okay!? Let\u2019s just get this done. Ten minutes of rest and I\u2019ll be as good as new,\u201d he lies, knowing perfectly well that it\u2019s only going to get worse after this. He never should\u2019ve tried to copy RB, this is what happens. A life-long ligament trauma, and now, degradation in front of the judges yet again. Yay! This day keeps getting better and better. \u201cI do my part, you do yours, we pretend that we\u2019re Bonnie and Clyde of the dance world, slay our competition, hopefully not get verbally shanked, head home, and never see each other again. Sounds like the perfect plan, right?\u201d\n\u201cLance-\u201c\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m just a bother to you, right!? I don\u2019t know what I was expecting. Hah. I never should\u2019ve signed up for any of this. You probably think of me as some incompetent obstacle holding you back.\u201c\n\u201cLan-\u201c\n\u201cI know that I\u2019m not Shiro, and will never be Shiro, but I don\u2019t want to fuck this up for you! Argh! I just can\u2019t be like the two of you, alright!? I\u2019m just dumb Lance with big dreams. Ugh, now Allura will hate me! Est\u00fapido, est\u00fapido, est\u00fapido-\u201c Lance looks close to smacking his leg in frustration.\nKeith\u2019s patience snaps like a twig.\n\u201cFor the love of- will you just shut up already!?\u201d He grips Lance\u2019s slimmer hands in his, holding tight enough to leave behind bruises. He catches his partner's wild gaze. \u201cDo you even hear yourself? Are you seriously that dense? Lance, you may not be Shiro, but that\u2019s why you\u2019re good. You\u2019re your own goddamn person.\u201d\nThe brunet takes in a sharp inhale, eyes gleaming with unshed tears. Keith continues. \u201cI took it out on you. It was a damn shitty thing to do and I\u2019m sorry, but goddamn. Stop comparing yourself to others. You have your own dance style that\u2019s unique, and if we manage to pull this off, you\u2019ll get to see just how well we match! And we match pretty damn well, Lance. I\u2019ve known this from day one. I could\u2019ve picked anyone, and I still went for your arrogant ass! And do you know why? Because I saw potential.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re just saying this to make me feel better!\u201d Lance chokes out around a sob, a lone tear slipping down a tanned cheek. His shoulders are shaking uncontrollably.\nKeith\u2019s throat is tight as he softens his grip and catches the straying droplet with his thumb, tone gentle. \u201cNo\u2026 I'd never say this if I didn\u2019t mean every single word. Shiro\u2026 He\u2019s Shiro, okay? He\u2019s good, it\u2019s undeniable, but you gotta remember that you are you. Just as good in your own way.\u201d Keith lines their foreheads together, giving the brown strands an awkward pat as he looks into his partner's startingly blue eyes. \u201cI took it out on you because of my own personal issues. This... This is the last dance that I actually worked on very hard. It was supposed to be for me and Shiro, true. I was mad because you were ruining that vision, I guess. But this. This is good too. We can make it work. I \u2013 I just always feel guilty that he can no longer dance. He could, and yet, he took those bullets for me.\u201d\nLance\u2019s breath stutters against Keith\u2019s damp lips. His eyes well up with a fresh wave of tears, as another silent sob rakes his lean frame. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\nStrong arms wrap around Keith\u2019s stiff shoulders, their hold surprisingly tight, wringing a surprised gasp from the black-haired man, but he forces himself to sit completely still, allowing the other man to drop his head on his shoulder. He lets Lance crumple against him, sobbing, bravado gone, all while he rubs soothing circles on his back. \u201cIt\u2019s fine now, shhh.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not! I was being selfish,\u201d Lance cries, the tip of his nose rubbing against the soft material of the instructor's clean shirt.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you so nice to me? I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\nKeith stays quiet. Honestly? He doesn\u2019t know.\nHe has a strong feeling as to why, though, especially after that night at the pub.\nHe carefully disentangles himself from the other when the shaking gradually subsides and the noises of distress die down. Keith offers his companion a hand to help him up. \u201cCan you stand? Move around?\u201d\n\u201cY-Yeah. I\u2019m used to this, it\u2019s just gonna be a bitch to use my legs too much.\u201d\n\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d Keith says, lending his shoulder for support. He watches Lance carefully shift his weight, teeth digging into his lower lip to bite back another wail of discomfort. \u201cJust stay here for a bit, I\u2019ll get some stuff from the staff room. Don\u2019t want others to see that you\u2019re down and think that they\u2019re losing competition.\u201d\nLance forces a laugh, hopping on one leg and awkwardly leaning against a marble column. \u201cWe\u2019ll win this,\u201d he reassures himself rather than Keith.\nThe black-haired man pats him on the shoulder before rushing out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Lance whispers once more when Keith bandages the leg, keeping touching to a bare minimum.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already thanked me.\u201d Keith points out, but doesn\u2019t look up as he continues working. The tips of his ears color a bright red.\n\u201cIt\u2019s never going to be enough,\u201d Lance sobs, tears of affection gathering in his eyes.\nHis emotions are messier than his bedroom.\n\u00a0\n\n[18:42 pm] Group chat name changed to: klance is canon yes vs no\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): Ladies.\n\n\nTonight is the final night to place your bets and win a hefty sum.\n\n\nBets are open until 8 p.m. aka the time of the final performance.\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett) sent itsthefinalcountdown.mp3\n\n\nIt\u2019s been an awesome five days but all good things must come to an end!! or continue, i guess we\u2019ll see\n\n\n30 bucks say that lance and keith get together at the end of this. 20 more is a dare\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): a dare you say\n\n\nim listening\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): 35 bucks if you and keith change up the moves and give us some fanservice\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): What pidge just said!!\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): i was planning on doing it either way weve encountered some technical difficulties so its unavoidable but thanks for the easy cash dudes\n\n\nas for the getting together id hold onto that cash tbh\n\n\ndon\u2019t think were gonna make it ive accepted this\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): Why you lyin, friend?\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): no pidge listen its fine if we dont get together the point is that i made friends here\n\n\neven jellybean boi wished me good luck\n\n\ni think he had his brains fried somehow because wtf creepy\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): You sound as though he rejected you already, mate.\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): not exactly i just dont get ~the vibes~ from him. at one point today i really thought he was going to kiss me man it was the perfect romcom moment but with less com and more salt\n\n\ndun dun dun he didn\u2019t\n\n\nwhat a shocker\n\n\ni accept death if my leg doesnt kill me before this is over\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson) sent narutosadnessandsorrow.mp3\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): You know what screw it, 60 dollars that you are gonna get together mark my words, lance\n\n\nsirlancealot (Lance McClain): i appreciate the enthusiasm bearbro but like let it go man youre just rubbing more salt into my achy breaky heart\n\n\npornbot justice (Pidge Gunderson): Me@Keith: \u201cdon\u2019t break his heart, his achy breaky heartttt~\u201d\n\n\nCurse of the Billy Ray Cyrus mullet, man, that\u2019s what this is.\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): Me@lance: fuck your bad vibes, bro &gt;: ( chin up!!!\n\n\u00a0\nLance puts together the best outfit that he has at this point, digging out the nicest track pants and throwing on the light blue button-down over his black shirt for the aesthetic. Keith joins him in the packed hall a moment later, looking divine as always in his tight leggings and a loose red crop top.\n\u201cThought you aren\u2019t teaching.\u201d Lance tries to joke, fixing his hat. There\u2019s a limp in his step, fuck.\nKeith only shrugs. \u201cI kind of am. Teaching the others their place.\u201d\n\u201cSick burns, pal,\u201d Lance snorts as they make their way to the main hall of the event.\n\u00a0\nLance goes over their moves, catching Keith\u2019s form with unwavering arms, face emotionless when they look into each other\u2019s eyes. He tries to keep it impersonal, thinking of what could be changed that would make his friends\u2019 jaws drop.\nHunk and Pidge sneak into the back stage, with Hunk immediately dragging Keith away, squeezing something into his hands. Probably some good luck charm.\nEm gave him hers, a braided bracelet with a small dolphin charm. He hugged the little struggling rascal, thanking her for actually giving a shit when it mattered the most.\n\u201cFloor us, bro, and this will be over.\u201d Pidge claps him on the shoulder a few times, grinning wide. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re gonna get the fame and the boy.\u201d\n\u201cIn my dreams, ha,\u201d Lance sighs, trying not to sound too devastated, sneaking in a secretive glance at Keith\u2019s curvy form. Beautiful as always. A crater on the surface of his achy fucking breaky heart. Curse you, Billy Ray Cyrus.\u00a0\n\u201cWe'll see,\u201d Pidge says smugly, as though they know something that Lance does not, and then they have to drag Hunk away. The bigger man flashes him a thumbs-up before the curtain falls back into place.\nKeith hides Hunk\u2019s item in the folds of his hoodie before Lance can see what it is.\n\u201cReady?\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d the brunet replies honestly, anxiety beginning to surface. The crowd\u2019s mumbling is rather ominous. Even the instrumental music of the ensuing ballet performance cannot drown it out.\nKeith says nothing, probably feeling the same.\nWhen it\u2019s their time to go, Lance catches the other\u2019s wrist, making him turn around. \u201cJust so you know, I\u2019m not doing this for you.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t expect it to be any other way.\u201d Keith nods tersely, but Lance\u2019s grip tightens.\n\nNow or never.\n\n\u201cNo, hear me out... I may not be doing this for you, but just so it\u2019s clear, this is for us. As a team.\u201d\nKeith doesn\u2019t get to say anything in return because their names are called and they step into the lights for the second time at this cursed dance camp of hell and heaven combined.\n\nGuess they\u2019ll never talk this one out, huh?\n\n\u00a0\nThey skip the introductions. The first beats of the song fill the air. Lance rolls up his sleeves, praying to every deity out there, wishing hard for his leg and bullshit to pull him through one last time, and Keith bounces lightly as though testing his mobility, gathering some strength.\nThe first moves leave Lance feeling content. It is something more so based on his personal style rather than Keith\u2019s. Still, the instructor keeps up with him just fine, completely in sync, shifting his weight comfortably to the right and using powerful moves with his arms, locking at the right points as though he\u2019s been dancing to this song in particular for years now.\nThe lights are no longer blinding. In fact, they kind of feel pleasant.\nTheir last dance. Gotta make it great.\nHe doesn't need to rely on his periphery to see Keith perfectly well, winking at him at the right moment, right when they face away from the crowd and work through those low squats followed by hip shimmies, Lance making his far more playful in a reflection of his style, stepping in and out of the beat just on time.\nHe starts counting down the seconds to the moment when he can start improvising. The squat has left his injured knee aching like a bitch, somewhat fucking up his timing and bounciness.\u00a0\n\n\u2018Fulfill my fantasies-'\n\nThe weird look that Keith shoots his way, right as Lance pulls his old moves, is strange, to say the least. He keeps going, still, allowing Lance his brief moment of glory.\u00a0\nLance\u2019s mind is a buzzing beehive of counting down beats, and when he sees a perfect opening, Keith\u2019s arm raised, ready to do that awesome shift of his, Lance sneaks up to him, placing the other\u2019s extended arm on his shoulder instead. Keith doesn\u2019t even bother to glance his way as they shift down together, as though it was supposed to be like this.\nAs though they\u2019re one.\nThe crowd gives an appraising roar as Lance grins. He cannot believe how well they\u2019re working together in their impromptu freestyling. It\u2019s almost as though Keith\u2019s reading his body language like an open book without having to properly look at him.\nThey spin around and face each other again, nearly laughing, Lance\u2019s arm loose around his partner's slim waist, legs spread wide and dipping lower again, a personal tribute to the exaggerated booty shaking and their \u2018dance session\u2019. Oh, they\u2019re going to leave some mouths hanging open.\nKeith mock-waves Lance off when they roll around on the floor, and, oh god,\u00a0 none of this is scripted, and yet it works out perfectly, Keith is actually freestyling, what is Lance\u2019s life even. The playful brunet offers his partner a hand, mentally preparing himself to do that catch and spin. He hopes for his knee to hold up the extra without any excessive problems.\nIt works. Keith's muscular, yet surprisingly light body is warm and pliant against him, the scent of sweat and sandalwood momentarily overtaking Lance's senses.\u00a0\nNormally, this would be the part where they end their routine, but Lance feels like a little shit, leaning in to smugly whisper into his partner's ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to dip you now.\u201d\nKeith barely reacts to that, planting his feet firmly on the ground before Lance does it, both grinning wide at the crowd that goes wild.\nThe clapping is positively deafening.\nLance takes off his hat and holds up his free hand, burning the image of his smiling, no-longer-instructor into his eyes. Who knows how long they have left? They\u2019re one of today\u2019s last performances.\nWho knows if they\u2019ll ever see each other again?\nLance can only hope that they\u2019ll remain good friends and continue to stay in touch, even if his stomach churns with discomfort at the thought. He really thought that there was something more going on between them. That there was some spark of sorts. Something, anything.\nHe doesn't want to be Keith's friend, oh no. He wants to be so much more.\n\u201cSlayed it!\u201d the brunet hoots, pulling his hand away when Keith goes in for a high-five. \u201cToo slow!\u201d he teases, desperately trying to fend off the beginnings of sadness threatening to pull him under now that the adrenaline was beginning to wear off.\nThey leave the stage, with Lance going for the left side and Keith going for the right.\n\u00a0\nLance would love to stay and watch at the rest of the performances \u2013 sadly, Em didn\u2019t make it, but she doesn't seem to be too disheartened by that \u2013 but he needs to pack his stuff. Pidge and Hunk showered him in praise and promised to wait in the hall, help him carry his things, mindful of his less-than-stellar condition.\nFor the first time in a long while, he feels that he needs a moment to himself.\nSadness and disappointment bloom in his chest, much like poisonous plants, spreading down his body like ivy tendrils.\nIf anyone had told Lance McClain that one day he would end up at a dance camp with RB members and actually enjoy it despite a few minor setbacks along the way, as well as the heavy start, he would\u2019ve laughed right into their face, saying something along the lines of \u2018Lame joke, try harder\u2019.\nWell, the joke\u2019s on him.\nHe feels that he should be seeking Keith out and thanking him for his time and infinite patience. Lance must\u2019ve cost the other man a lot of nerves, especially judging by Keith's final outburst, but he knows that he's likely going to tear up before voicing any of it out. He\u2019s been pretty terrible, he cannot deny it, but Keith wasn\u2019t exactly very nice to him either. No point in looking back to that now. They\u2019re a team, a duo, and while they may not be RB, they\u2019ll always be something \u2013 Lance and Keith, the Wonder team, red and blue, fire and water, two sides of the same coin.\n\u201cLeaving without saying anything? Didn\u2019t peg you as that type of guy.\u201d\nLance halts, turning around to meet Keith. He tries to school his features into something carefully neutral. With very little success, though, considering the sharp pangs of pain coursing down his body, knee aflame. He cannot wait to ice it. \u201cI\u2019ve a lot of packing up left to do. Would\u2019ve properly said goodbye afterwards.\u201d Maybe. Not really. Definitely not.\nKeith closes in on him, carefully inspecting Lance\u2019s snapback, squinting. It\u2019s the same one from that night a lifetime ago. \u201cHey. Remember that douchebag that I told you about? The one in the flashy snapback,\u201d Keith steals his hat like the goddamn tease that he is. Lance almost wants to crack up at the irony of it all. He watches Keith pull the hat over his head. \u201cHe ran off on me, too. So yeah, I don\u2019t think I really trust you enough with this.\u201d\nLance coughs into his fist, awkwardly shifting his weight. His leg is killing him. \u201cBest of luck finding that asshole. He\u2019s undeserving if he bailed on you like that.\u201d\nKeith laces his fingers behind his back and crosses his ankles. \u201cOh yeah, I agree. Real dipshit, that one. I\u2019m going to ask him why he did that the moment I see him again, along with some other stuff. Had me curious, you know.\u201d\nLance is at a loss of words. Bitter regret and anger directed at himself surge in his chest at that. He cannot believe that he acted like such a coward, and doesn\u2019t want to damage his image in Keith\u2019s eyes any further. He\u2019s already been acting like a huge, needy baby.\nIt\u2019s better if they never talk this one out.\n\u201cI see. I, uh, really gotta go now. I\u2019ll see you in the hall, man.\u201d Lance vaguely gestures behind himself, taking a few steps back in the direction of the grand staircase, head lowered in defeat.\nThe next three seconds are a bit of a blur.\n\u201cHey, Lance, think fast!\u201d the black-haired man warns right before Lance feels some cold, gooey substance splash down his face, dripping in rivulets.\nSon of a bitch, that stings!\n\u201cKeith, what the shit!?\u201c Lance coughs, spitting out some of the goop that enters his open mouth, nose wrinkling at the taste. Paint. It\u2019s bloody body paint. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201c\nHe feels Keith\u2019s cool palm rub at the lower half of his face.\nWith a dull sense of horror in his gut, Lance watches him retract the hand, now completely covered in smudged electric blue paint.\nOh. Oh no.\nThe snapback is placed back on his head. Keith\u2019s smile is smug when he speaks up again. \u201cI knew it was you. Those moves are unmistakable. You\u2019re the mystery guy, Lance.\u201d\nLance\u2019s eyes are the size of saucers as he opens his mouth a few times, only to close it dumbly, no sound tumbling out. Instead, he tries to force a grin, spreading out his arms. \u201cBam! Surprise!\u201d He rather lamely attempts to regain at least some of his lost dignity. Fuck. Shit. Damn it. Why him? \u201cIt is I, the mystery douche in a snapback. From Team Voltron, in case you\u2019ve forgotten,\" he guffaws, too loud in his ears. Lance winces, cringing inwardly and openly terrified, as Keith continues gaping, bemused. \"And now I must skedaddle. It's been pretty fly dancing with you, Keith!\u201d he squeaks out, voice high-pitched, strained, and attempts to bail \u2013 oh, the irony \u2013 but Keith tugs him back by the sleeve of his shirt, leaving bright blue fingerprints all over it.\n\u201cNot so fast! I\u2019ve got stuff to ask.\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d Lance whines, covering his face with his free hand, and smudging the paint even further. \u201cI already know that this was a horrible idea. I ran off on you and I\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to, I-\"\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You came back in the end, so I kind of forgive you.\u201c Keith\u2019s fingers curl into the collar of his shirt, indigo eyes flickering to his lips for a second. \u201cBut here\u2019s the catch - I\u2019m going to forgive you if you actually kiss me this time. No running, alright? It\u2019s been like a year.\u201d Those alluring, cursed eyes flick back up to Lance's, determined. \"Do it properly.\"\nLance stumbles forward, knees far too weak and achy to hold his weight. Is this really happening? What the hell, oh god.\nDid Keith just seriously ask him that?\nDid he die and go to heaven? Is he dreaming? If so, please let him sleep.\u00a0\n\u201cUnless you don\u2019t want to\u2026?\u201d the black-haired man trails off, sounding far less self-assured now that the silence between them has ended up dragging out. Far less spirited and more than a little confused, he shifts to pull away, but Lance only shakes his head to the sides so fast that he hurts his neck.\u00a0\nHis crushing sadness gets replaced with warm, fuzzy feelings, threatening to overspill. Threatening to kill him.\u00a0\nHe'll die if he doesn't feel Keith Kogane's lips on his.\n\u201cNo! No, no, no, no takebacks! Here I go,\u201d he babbles nervously, hyping himself up before finally leaning in. Keith snorts when Lance\u2019s snapback gets in the way, the brim bumping against his forehead. He pushes it to the side, finally meshing their lips together.\nLance dies and goes to heaven three times in a row, one of his legs popping up as though this is a teen romance movie. A mistake, because ouch!\nKeith\u2019s kisses are a little clumsy and definitely inexperienced, but that's alright. Lance will be more than happy to teach him all of his smooching techniques. He\u2019ll teach him a whole lot more things in the future, too.\n\u201cYou wanna dip me maybe? For that ultimate cheesy effect?\u201d Lance whispers against the other\u2019s soft lips.\nKeith complies, ducking his head for another kiss.\n\u00a0\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett): Im gonna make it rain cashmoney B)\n\n\nFree mickey ds for you my friends\n\n\n[22:01 pm] Group chat name changed to: Hunk\u2019s ALWAYS right\n\n\nBeach hunk (Hunk Garrett) added Valoroucious (Keith Kogane)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey don\u2019t win the first place, but Lance walks out feeling like the king of the world anyway.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Keith says, taking a bite of his fry. \u201cYou should seriously consider starting a dance choreography channel.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, yes!\u201d Pidge squeaks, nearly dropping their ice cream. \u201cI've been saying the same thing for ages! We could be, like, so famous! Especially if Keith and Shiro agree to throw around some promos.\u201d\n\u201cOr I can simply be a frequent guest,\u201d the aforementioned man shrugs. \u201cI mean, someone\u2019s gotta keep Lance in check. The fame might get to your thick skull, McClain.\u201d\n\u201cDo you wanna go, pretty boy!?\u201d Lance roars, his eyebrow twitching. How dare.\n\u201cOh, I wanna. Come at me!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you wanna go? You wanna go on a fucking date!?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re already on a date!\u201d\nHunk finishes his cola, slurping noisily. He faces Pidge, shrugging. \u201cAnd all is well.\u201d\nAll is well, indeed.\nExcept they get kicked out for throwing fries.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cStop tugging on your sweater like that. It\u2019s just a family dinner, not a wedding, sheesh.\u201d Lance reprimands his date, smacking his fingers away from a loose thread hanging in the other\u2019s sleeve. \u201cMa cooked up a storm. I think we could feed half of the world's population like this.\u201d\n\u201cNo pressure, am I right, McClain?\u201d Keith mumbles moodily, fixing his hair now. Lance can see right through that fake chill fa\u00e7ade, he\u2019s far too nervous to function.\n\u201cWill you still be calling me McClain when we share the same last name?\u201d Lance chirps, ringing the doorbell again.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what? You\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re insufferable!\u201d Keith huffs, face turning a little red. Lance kind of wants to kiss it. No, scratch that - he really wants to do it.\nSo he goes for it.\nIt\u2019s how they usually end their petty arguments as of late.\nPidge opens the door, face scrunching up when they see Lance backing Keith up against the wall. \u201cMa, they\u2019re being gross again!\u201d Pidge calls out.\nEm yells somewhere from the hallway. \u201cUse the spray bottle, it works for me. They should calm down.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be hating my game just because you\u2019re all jealous,\u201c Lance laughs, quickly pecking Keith on the cheek one last time before dragging his boyfriend inside.\nThis is the guy he\u2019ll eat all the nut cheese for, he thinks, when he sees a huge one lying on the kitchen table.\nThis is the guy who is his equal and always will be."
