    "summary": "<p>A new Team Seven enters the chunin exam and all the disasters that accompany it. And they may be stronger and better than ever before, but like most stories; the stronger you get, the harder the challenges you rise to meet are. Team Seven is going to survive the chunin exams and that's better than winning in Kakashi's book.</p>\n<p>Teamwork and the meaning of home</p>",
    "notes": "<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Part one of the elimination rounds. You may notice some changes. As said in the last chapter, the Oto nin were met with more resistance and less mercy from Team Seven and their absence is going to mess up the number of competitors and match-ups. Also i would never believe the Hokage would leave these match-ups to chance. Certain matches and people would need to go on to A) bring people to watch the exams, B) show off Konoha's skills, and C) they already deserve Chunin rank. </p>\n<p>A little more about Naruto being more controlled and calm and a bit about Team Seven already suspicious of Kabuto.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Some more changes in the match-ups and a few different final participants. Onto the training month!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Enter Kabuto. And then immediately exit Kabuto. I just feel like Kakashi would have met a threat like Kabuto with extreme prejudice. The fact that in cannon he constantly slips away seems unrealistic when faced against geniuses like Kakashi who recognize him as a threat. And with back-up, no matter how slippery he is, doubtful he would escape a village on high alert.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Training Strategy created! Enter Team Gai!</p>\n<p>Since they were more sneaky when entering the exams a while back, there was never the hallway scene with Team Gai nor did Lee and Sasuke spar. So this is their first meeting</p>\n<p>Sakura might seem a little too evenly matched with Lee but I tried to explain how the kids have been getting so much more training than any of the other genin and how well they are doing. Team Gai has only had a year longer than Team Kakashi and are restricted by time more so than Team Kakashi who had six solid months of intensive training. Its like comparing the training of some kids in martial arts a few times a week to those who go to boot camp. </p>\n<p>I also look at it like how in Cannon they became monsters at like 18, with Sakura surpassing Tsunade and stuff. the kids obviously have potential and it comes out with Kakashi's focus. So i don't think they're too OOC or overpowered.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Yugao to help out Sasuke and Sakura! I wanted to bring some more characters into play. </p>\n<p>Also I theorized that the Hokage had to draw a lot of ninja back during the chunin exams due to foreign presence in the village. But with everyone back in the village there would be a lot of ninja with free time outside of patrolling. </p>\n<p>Also enter Jiraya. I had Kakashi argue against using the Kyuubi because it seems like the history of the kyuubi jinchuriki is that they don't often use it's power, not like Naruto later does in the anime at least. With a firm hand and all the training he can take Naruto is growing into a person who doesn't need the borrowed abilities either. And while summoning is useful, it was shown in the manga itself that unless he taped the Kyuubi's power, he was unable to summon more than a tadpole, so useless right now. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As for the sharingan, i think the manga went the wrong way with Sasuke wanting to use it so bad. With Kakashi's guiding hand and example, Sasuke is realizing he has a way to power that doesn't rely on his eye. And after seeing his brother murder his family using them i thought there had to be some hesitation in gaining his own/using it.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Some Kakashi and Gai friendship time. I didn't like how their friendship wasn't explored more in the manga since Gai grew up with Kakashi and had such an effect on him. </p>\n<p>And some Kakashi getting retrained on his tanto. The kids aren't the only ones getting some training in. </p>\n<p>.--.</p>\n<p>Sorry about the short length and time between updating. With school starting a new semester I have been lacking free time</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Jiraya approving of Naruto in sexy-no-jutsu form always rubbed me the wrong way. Didn't matter that he looked like an older woman, he was still a young boy. Even if Jiraya did it as a joke it is not cool. And this over-protective Kakashi does not like it, nor does Sakura. And of course Iruka will kill someone who hurts Naruto with his bare hands. It's not a huge part of the story, but in my world there is no weird leering at young boys disguised as women, especially when you should be their teacher or guardian.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_9_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>A little anti-climatic on the Jiraya fight but the fight isn't completely over. There was no way someone as powerful and favored as Jiraya would be blocked out of Naruto's life completely but Kakashi made damn sure he's going to be supervised. </p>\n<p>And then a little talk on consent. Consent is sexy.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_10_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>So some Iruka and Naruto time! I loved Iruka in the manga and thought he was such a good influence on Naruto. And some medic time for Sakura and Sasuke. While Sakura had the control she did in the manga, she has different motivations. Sasuke on the other hand is growing closer to his team and more concerned with their help, thus an interest in medical jutsu.</p>\n<p>And then a lazy sunday with some Sasuke and Kakashi time. Sakura also doesn't see her parents as often, busy with training and stuff, but she stills has a relationship with her parents. </p>\n<p>And Asuma and Kurenai! team Seven is going to interact with their age-mates fianlly.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_11_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Some more Kakashi training! And some of my own theory on genjutsu stuff.</p>\n<p>And Naruto might have been raised a half feral child with very little human companionship, but Kakashi is trying to make up for that.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_12_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>A little Sakura heavy this chapter but oh well. I think Sakura's an awesome character but she does often need validation. There's nothing wrong with needing praise and encouragement. While Naruto isn't used to it but can pick up on it and Sasuke is used to empty praise but also knows he is indeed good, Sakura needs more vocal coaching. I picture her as the girl in school that was a teacher's pet, as well as a encouraged daughter, who was used to hearing how good she was and when she stops hearing that and with no back ground knowledge in ninja life from her family, she's sometimes lost and worried she's behind (especially with these teammates). So sometimes she just needs to hear she is doing good and that struggling is normal. Picture her as the kid who got good grades in secondary school effortlessly and got praised as 'smart' and then stepped into college and fell a few grade averages (or thought she did).</p>\n<p>Some more weapons training and rationale why you don't see them all the time. </p>\n<p>And then haircut scene because Sakura is finding more confidence in herself and expressing it in a way she has done for years (fashion). Look up Japanese boy cut for what i had in mind for Sakura's haircut (sort of bowl-cutish but more stylish). </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for all the comments and kudos! for those of you hoping Jiraya appears again, don't worry, there will be ...stuff happening :)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_13_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Sorry about the long wait! School and life caught up with me and gave me a beat down. </p>\n<p>So Team Ten and Eight Vs Team Seven. While i didn't want to make Team seven too overpowered I wanted to show how much more advanced they are compared to their graduation group. they had to use a lot of quick surprise tactics to win so handily (as well as having long since studied other Konoha bloodlines and techniques) and also knowing the grounds really well (they could have trained their before or used the morning to get to know the layout while they waited). </p>\n<p>If Team Ten or Eight had known before hand what they were walking into I think Team Seven would have had to fight a bit harder for their win, but as I said; lots of surprise on their side helped.</p>\n<p>I just wanted some Konoha-nin interaction as well as showing how Team Seven stood with the other teams of their year.</p>\n<p>Also some genius-genius interaction from Shikamaru and Kakashi, along with some more breakdown of ANBU.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_14_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>The kids realize what Kakashi wanted when he said Teamwork, and why they are good at it. </p>\n<p>Then just a little bit of one on one time with each of his students as Kakashi realizes they really do consider his old manor their home.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_15_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Sorry for so many fluffy chapters lately, just trying to center where Team Seven is at emotionally and physically.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_16_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>So I didn't kill of Hayate like in the manga! I couldn't bring myself to do it. I explained it away as the bit of extra training he'd been doing with Kakashi and the kids gave him just enough edge to let him survive. Just an extra bit of speed in dodging changed it from death to near-death. </p>\n<p>And the kids learn about the Kyuubi. In fact they already knew. I hope no one was disappointed in the blase reveal, i just thought the two would never make a big deal of it with this much trust between them.</p>\n<p>A short chapter as well, but the next one promises to be longer.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_17_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>A little sprinkle of PLOT!</p>\n<p>And just our Team Seven showing how strong they are getting.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_18_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Sasuke is told his real nature affinity!</p>\n<p>People realize his kids have seen Kakashi's face! And THE clipboard is back but this time focused on Kakashi while his students help mass produce barrier linking seals. </p>\n<p>And a brief explanation (excuse) for why ninja don't use clones for everything. As well as a quick look at why they shout jutsu names.</p>\n<p>Also Kabuto is dead so the two that Hayate caught talking weren't Baki and Kabuto but Baki and some other no-name character</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_20_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>So I thought that like i'd been hinting, there is no way they didn't have a clue about the invasion. And in this Team Seven, Kakashi would never let his kids go in blind (too much of a risk), but he's not allowed to tel them, so this. But the kids are smart too, they were in cannon as well (in different ways). </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sorry the chapter is so late and so short. More to come!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_21_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>And so the invasion begins and the end nears.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_22_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>End of the second arch!</p>\n<p>On to Part 2: The Chunin Exams! As much as things change, they stay the same, and Team Seven faces the same challenges in cannon even if they approach them differently. </p>\n<p>Sasuke gets his sharingan, Sakura gets some realistic damage from having her face wailed on, and Naruto shows just what a ball of emotion he really is around his team. </p>\n<p>Onto the elimination round!</p>",
    "text": "Kakashi met his team at the tower, anxious and trembling just the slightest even if he hid it by burying his hands in his pockets. They stumbled into the tower, barely two hours before the end of the second exam and they looked like utter hell. \n\u201cInjuries?\u201d Kakashi barked, stress making him harsh.\n\u201cSakura\u2019s cheek is broken, as well as around her eye,\u201d Naruto said desperate, \u201cAnd I think her wrist is sprained. And Sasuke has to have broken ribs! He\u2019s also got this bite!\u201d\nSakura looked shaky, breathing wet and raspy through the blood crusted around her nose and mouth, eye blackened, and face bruised and swelling. Sasuke was breathing shallow and careful, more grace in his movement than usual as he tried not to jostle his sides. Naruto was probably fine due to his healing factor.\nTheir clothes were cut and ripped and dirtied to an extreme degree, Sasuke\u2019s kimono top hanging on by scraps, Sakura\u2019s missing, and Naruto\u2019s haori barely orange under the mud and the blood and the gunk. All their armor had held up though despite the scrapes and mars. Judging by the blade marks on the paint job on Sakura\u2019s leg armor, someone had tried to take multiple blades to them and they had saved her. \nSasuke looked to be in shock, with perhaps the tail end of a fever, shaking slightly. And then there was a flash of red as the Sharingan flickered out of Sasuke\u2019s face, something like horror etched in the lines of his face, and Kakashi winced. \nThey\u2019d have to have a talk about that later. Naruto looked a bit better, scraped up and marred, but his healing had saved him the worst of it. He merely looked frazzled, eyes darting between his teammates as he flittered around them like a worried bird. \nKakashi looked at his trembling, bleeding, beaten down team and nearly fell on them with relief.\nThen Sakura burst into tears, cradling her beaten face, crying harder as it jostled her injuries, the snot clogging her airways. Naruto followed, sniffling before bawling. Even Sasuke took one look at their shared misery, eyes blackening, and started crying. Despite their injuries Kakashi dragged them into a gentle hug.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he whispered, \u201cYou did good. You did fantastic. I\u2019m proud of all of you. You\u2019re all alive and maybe you\u2019re hurt but we can fix that,\u201d \nThey sobbed, clinging to him, even Sasuke joining in, and he simply held them for a long moment. When Sakura started to choke on the blood, snot, tears, and pain he started to herd them to the medical clinic that had been set up in a spare room. The medic-nin on duty all but fell on his students, wiping and disinfecting and bandaging. \nKakashi hovered about the edges waiting until they were finally returned to his arms they looked a tad better.\n\u201cOkay, deep breaths,\u201d Kakashi said softly, \u201cNow we are going to go get food since we don\u2019t have time to wash off, and then we have the next stage of the exam to do. Are you good?\u201d\nThey all nodded, looking a tad better now that the blood on their faces and hands had been washed away. So Kakashi dragged them to an empty room and withdrew the meals he had sealed away. He had planned to give them to a victorious team emerged from the forest with little injury. He hadn\u2019t been worried because he had trusted they were better than any of the other genin hopefuls if simply for the fact their teamwork was nearly flawless. \nAnd then reports of Orochimaru had been passed along to Kakashi and he had panicked. He would have been on the team trying to hunt the man down if he didn\u2019t have his team to think of first.\n\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d Kakashi urged as his students inhaled the food after three days in the Forest of Death.\nNaruto started, obviously the one with the most energy, with Sakura and Sasuke only inputting when he forgot a detail. \nNaruto told him of the first stage, of eyeing teams warily and staying close together despite various teams mingling. They had an easy written exam that they had managed to cheat through using Sakura\u2019s genjutsu. She\u2019d layered a vision of the answers she knew over the paper which they traced and that was that. \nThey told him of how they had been so smug at the thought of a forest survival exam, knowing that despite the ramped up danger they could do it. Kakashi learned of how smooth it had been going, of how they had got their scroll the second day in, early in the morning and set off towards the tower. Then they told him of being ambushed by the disguised Orochimaru, of a snake summon eating Naruto. Told him of how Sakura and Sasuke had attacked the man, enraged, and gotten beat down savagely. \nNaruto had rejoined them and they had attempted a retreat but Orochimaru was a Sannin for a reason. He had chased them down for half a day, running them into the ground and harrying them. And then he\u2019d done something to Naruto\u2019s seal knocking him out of the fight and out of consciousness. \nSakura wearily took up the tale saying how they had thought the blond dead and Sasuke\u2019s sharingan had come blooming to life. She told him how Orochimaru had then dismissed her and focused on Sasuke. They had fought desperately, but the man had been too strong. This is when he laid the seal on Sasuke\u2019s neck. Sakura said she had tried to stop it and had managed to land a devastating hammer hit to Orochimaru\u2019s neck, but the man had simply brushed it off as every other injury he had.\nShe had thought them both dead and attacked Orochimaru in a blind rage. She claimed to have gotten in one more hammer blow before he tossed her out of a tree and vanished, leaving her to land funny and break her wrist. She had escaped with the least injuries but had taken a while to gather herself as she had thought both teammates dead until she\u2019d checked their pulses. \nSakura mumbled something about being so glad they were alive she had simply stayed there for a bit, alone and exhausted but at least alive. She told Kakashi how she had retreated to a more defendable location and hunkered down, using most of Naruto\u2019s supplies and former teachings to lay the most deadly traps she could. \nThe boys had had the night to rest, but Sakura drove herself further into exhaustion by keeping watch and making sure her teammates kept breathing despite Naruto\u2019s stillness and Sasuke\u2019s high fever. \nAnd then they had been attacked by an Oto-nin team. Sakura calmly told him, sounding almost detached form the story, of how they must have been high chunin smuggled in under the guise of genin. The traps had worked at keeping them at bay for a while and managed to severely injure the kunoichi\u2019s leg. But they had not worked to fully protect the three and Sakura had been drawn into battle.\nSakura had tried her best obviously, but two on one when Sakura was injured, exhausted, and held back by having to keep on the defense, led to a losing battle for her. In the end she had managed to knock one of the other Oto-nin back, crushing his shoulder in a devastating punch with her knuckle dusters. \nThe last one had decided to make her death slow when she had held onto him with the last of her strength to stop him from murdering his target; Sasuke. He had apparently started beating her viciously. It explained the cracked cheekbone, the fracture eye socket, and the light concussion she had had on top of the bruises. \nThat was when Sasuke had awoke, the seal coming to life on his skin. The boy beating Sakura had not survived more than a minute more and Sakura said that all that was left of him now was pieces strewn about. Naruto having woken quickly into this rage had apparently been in no better a mood seeing Sakura wheezing for breath through her own blood and had viciously destroyed the other two who had stepped in, despite injury, to try and save their teammate.\nAll three looked sickly proud of themselves, eyes wide with glee and horror, and Kakashi made sure to give them a proud smile and ruffle their hair. While revenge was not something they liked to cultivate in their shinobi, vengeance for a teammate was understandable.\n\u201cYou did well,\u201d Kakashi said once more, heartfelt, \u201cYou\u2019re all alive and you walked away from a Sanin and the assassination team he sent after you. I\u2019m very proud.\u201d\nThey beamed despite the mud and blood and injuries, cheeks stuffed with food as they finished their meals.\n\u201cThe next round is a set of battles,\u201d Kakashi explained despite the fact he really wasn\u2019t supposed to, \u201cAre you ready?\u201d\n\u201cBring it!\u201d Naruto roared. \n\u201cEven with your wonky chakra?\u201d Kakashi asked.\nNaruto merely pumped a fist into the air and shoveled his last mouthful of food in.\n\u201cDespite knowing you can\u2019t use chakra without that poisonous seal acting up?\u201d Kakashi asked Sasuke.\nSasuke\u2019s fists clenched and he gave a sharp nod.\n\u201cDespite the fact if they hit you in the face you\u2019re going to go down hard?\u201d Kakashi asked Sakura.\nShe nodded decisively. He beamed at the team and waved them out the door. He caught Sakura\u2019s arm as she went last and she looked up at him. He pressed a small pill into her hand.\n\u201cA solider pill,\u201d he murmured, \u201cThere are no rules against them but they really aren\u2019t good for you. Especially not for growing genin. But you\u2019ve been hit the hardest. Take it before your match.\u201d\nHe gave her a serious look and she nodded, just as solemn, taking the pill. It was a cheat of course, and no genin should be using them in the exam. But genin weren\u2019t also supposed to face Sannin and assassination teams mid-exam. \nKakashi led the group of them down to the arena to face the elimination rounds.\nAnd if Kakashi had to regulate his breathing, had to unclench sweaty hands and calm a shake, well no one saw it besides his students and they said nothing. They had survived. He kept telling himself that even as he tried not to see Sasuke\u2019s tremble, or hear Sakura\u2019s wheezy breathing, or feel the sheer concern Naruto radiated when he looked at the other two. \nThey had survived and that was all that mattered.\nNow\u2026\nNow they were going to claw their way to a win. And Kakashi would be at their back every step of the way\n.--.\nAll the other teams who had passed the Forest of Death were already lingering on the balcony when Team Seven entered through a small inconspicuous side door. Kakashi\u2019s eyes scanned the room as he kept his kids close and noted the attention that focused on them as they entered. Asuma\u2019s team was the closest to their entranvce and Kakashi took in the way Asuma\u2019s team was now staring at his kids looking a shade paler. Kakashi wondered if they had perhaps caught sight of any of their battles and been smart enough not to get involved, but cowardly enough not to help a fellow Konoha team. Kakashi supposed he couldn\u2019t really blame some genin for not engaging a Sannin or assassination team. \nHayate called the genin down and Kakashi watched them closely as Hayate gave a speech. His kids looked calm and collected, shoulders brushing as they gave a united front, Sasuke and Naruto flanking Sakura to make up for her still slightly swollen eyes. Hayate was going over the rules of the next stage and waiting to see if anyone gave up now. Only one boy, a silver haired tall genin, did. \nKakashi\u2019s eyes sharpened on the boy when he saw Sasuke, Naruto, and Sakura all give him suspicious glances. He had personally trained and cultivated his student\u2019s instincts and he knew when to trust the three. That all three were in agreement of their suspicious was like a blaring sign to Kakashi. He made some subtle sharp hand signs at one of the ANBU cloaked in the corner of the room and really couldn\u2019t tell when he vanished, but knew he would follow up. \nHis students trudged back up to him faces calm despite their exhaustion as they flopped down, leaning against his legs. He absently handed out head pats as the curled up at his feet. The large sign board started to flip through names and Kakashi watched carefully. Seventeen genin passing the Forest of Death meant eight match-ups and one double fight. Since three of those names were his students there were good odds they may have to fight. But\u2026\nKakashi glanced at the Hokage who watched said board calmly. There was no way the Hokage didn\u2019t have a way to rig the sign board. He would have to trust that the Hokage would keep his students from fighting one another, at least until the final round at the actual combat stage. That was a fight that would need spectators to fully enjoy. \n\u201cFirst match, Naruto vs. Yoroi!\u201d\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d Sakura patted Naruto on the back.\n\u201cHaha! Thanks Sakura!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t make a fool of Team Seven,\u201d Sasuke grumbled.\n\u201cIf anyone\u2019s going to do that, it\u2019s you, Bastard!\u201d Naruto laughed, obviously fond despite the name calling.\n\u201cMake sure not to show off too much,\u201d Kakashi smiled at the blonde, \u201cMaybe try to be discreet. You will want to keep some aces up your sleeve.\u201d\nNaruto gave him a mock salute and leapt down to the floor and Kakashi wasn\u2019t worried. Naruto had the most energy of the three. Besides that he had read up on all the teams and he knew that this Yoroi kid had the ability to suck out chakra. Which would be useless against Naruto\u2019s massive stores. The guy was in for a bit of a surprise. Especially since Naruto wouldn\u2019t use chakra to fight due to whatever Orochimaru had done. Just to be safe.\n\u201cThe dead last of his graduating class,\u201d Yoroi snorted, \u201cThis will be easy.\u201d\n\u201cBring it on you bastard!\u201d Naruto grinned, though there was much less friendliness in this grin. \nSasuke and Sakura and Kakashi had all worked on training him out of knee-jerk reactions of defensive yelling. They had calmed his energy a tad, smoothed his hackles, and taught him not everyone\u2019s opinions mattered, only theirs and they knew the truth. They had taught him to focus his anger, his indignation into a sharp blade instead of loud wastes of energy. \nHayate cleared his throat and stepped between the two to give the official signal.\n\u201cYour team looks like hell, Kakashi,\u201d Asuma greeted as he stepped up beside Kakashi, Gai sliding near as well.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s what happens when you face off against a Sannin and then an assassination squad,\u201d Kakashi said chirpily, turning back to watch Naruto. \n\u201cThe fuck?\u201d Asuma muttered, obviously not up to date on the intel. \n\u201cDo you think your student will win?!\u201d Gai boomed cheerfully, obviously knowing exactly what Kakashi was talking about. \n\u201cThere is no doubt,\u201d Kakashi nodded seriously.\nAnd down in the ring Hayate had started the match. Naruto went barreling at the other boy, fists raised. And only a few of the sharpest eyes caught the metal bands around Naruto\u2019s fingers. Yoroi deflected a few bows, ducking under Naruto\u2019s wide swings. But then Naruto spun, snaking his arms in the boy\u2019s guard and grabbed him by the shoulders when he tried to dodge.\nThe boy gave a startled half pained scream, startling a few viewers even as Naruto grinned, gripping tighter. Naruto engaged him in a close-range tussle, using his legs to kick and keeping a tight hold. The boy flailed at the pain and the unexpected close combat. When Naruto did let go, he leapt back to make some distance. Yoroi hissed, shakily touching the deep puncture wounds on his shoulders. Naruto grinned cheerfully and waved, the blood dripping metal on his hands now visible. \n\u201cKarute,\u201d Asuma identified with a surprised look. \nKakashi nodded, not saying anything about how Naruto was a natural with them and as such wore some that were a tad sharper and longer, ridged more like saws. Anyone else would have risked cut palms and fingers, but Naruto was dexterous and with his healing rate a few gouges didn\u2019t matter. \nYoroi rushed Naruto, hands glowing. Naruto dodged and Kakashi could see Yoroi growing frustrated as his signature technique seemed to do nothing to Naruto\u2019s boundless energy. That\u2019s what you got for being a one-trick pony against someone who was immune.\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it working?!\u201d the boy demanded. \nNaruto clearly hadn\u2019t caught on to what the boy as doing and simply launched himself at the boy without answering. This time the boy dodged his grabs. But then Naruto switched techniques going for open palmed blows that Sasuke had taught him. With the karute on his hands, these were spiked smacks that caught the boy in the chest, knocking the air out of him and gouging his skin. \nWhile the boy fell back Naruto twisted and clobbered him over the head with a sharp blow that sent him sprawling. Hayate watched a moment then declared Naruto the winner as the boy was deemed unconscious. \n\u201cYou said to be discreet, was that good?\u201d Naruto asked with a grin as he joined them, \u201cI didn\u2019t use any jutsu or nothin\u2019! Just my Karute!\u201d\n\u201cIt was perfect. Good job!\u201d Kakashi cheered, ruffling the boy\u2019s hair.\nNaruto beamed, pleased as he slipped the bloody Karute off his hands and tucked them away. \n\u201cI heard when he graduated his taijutsu was appalling,\u201d Asuma muttered as Naruto stretched himself flat on the ground looking ready for a nap and ignoring the other jonin. \nAsuma had muttered but Naruto had sharp hearing. Kakahsi was glad at times like this he had helped make sure Naruto understood other people would speak up for him and that sometimes you needed to keep words inside and think before you spoke. He could hear Asuma\u2019s comment but he trusted Kakashi to deal with the other jonin instead of getting insulted.\n\u201cIt still is!\u201d Gai laughed, \u201cThat was a mess of styles and techniques!\u201d\n\u201cBut it worked,\u201d Kakashi pointed out, \u201cNaruto isn\u2019t the type of kid to master a smooth graceful style. He\u2019s a brawler type. We just gave him the moves he could use and he makes them work.\u201d\nGai laughed not at all upset at the obviously messy, almost taijutsu-offending fighting Naruto was picking up. \n\u201cNext Match, Temari vs Tenten!\u201d\n\u201cAh, kids, perk up here,\u201d Kakashi said nudging his students where were half drifting around his feet, \u201cRemember I mentioned a budding weapon\u2019s mistress?\u201d\nThey perked up now, peering the bunned girl. Gai beamed near him at the recognition of his student. They watched the match avidly, wincing as they realized how terrible it was for a weapons master, especially one who favored long distance weapons, to go up against a wind user. \n\u201cAlways remember, there is someone better than you and there is always something that will have an advantage over your techniques,\u201d Kakashi said out loud despite the fact they obviously knew that.\nThey watched Tenten lose despite her repertoire and Kakashi gave them a quick quiz on what jutsu could have been better or what taijutsu or genjutsu would have worked. His kids gave sleepy answers but watched the match till the end where they applauded despite the harsh finish to the match. \nSometimes things just lined up terribly and it would do good for his kids to remember that.\n.--.\n\u201cNext match, Kiba vs Sasuke!\u201d\nSasuke sat up and pushed himself to his feet. Kakashi gently rested a hand on his shoulder, looking him over. Sasuke met his gaze squarely.\n\u201cRemember, if that seal spreads,\u201d Kakashi warned, trailing off ominously. \n\u201cI have control,\u201d Sasuke snapped, offended by the suggestion that he didn\u2019t.\nKakashi gave him a shoulder squeeze and tried to convey by eyes alone that he believed the boy. He must have been successful because Sasuke relaxed.\n\u201cGood, go give him hell.\u201d\nAnd Sasuke did. Kiba was good, especially with his ninken but Sasuke was a league above him as he had been in the academy. The Inuzuka were mainly taijutsu fighters with a few ninjutsu and their ninken. While some assumed as an Uchiha Sasuke would be a ninjutsu and genjutsu user, Sasuke had not had anyone to teach him those skills in a while. So Sasuke had stuck to taijutsu, something he could practice by himself. All the strength and stamina training paired with speed exercises in the past half a year had simply made him even better. So despite the fact Sasuke couldn\u2019t use chakra at the moment, he dominated his match. \nHe looked pleased with himself as he resettled beside Sakura and Naruto and promptly passed out. Kakashi chuckled fondly as Sakura pat the boy\u2019s head gently.\n\u201cNext match, Ino vs Hinata.\u201d\nThis match drew out a tad longer than the others. Ino was mediocre beyond her family jutsu but Hinata was too fast to be caught in those. Hinata was too nervous though, not wanting to hurt a fellow Konoha-nin, so her attacks were hesitant. So it went that Hinata who should have won outright in the first few minutes hesitated and it ended up being drawn out. In the end it was a draw, Hinata getting surprised by Ino\u2019s last stubborn attack and unwilling to lash out too severely. Hinata ended up knocking Ino out just as Ino landed a hit on her head and knocked her out as well. Tie. \n\u201cNext match, Shino vs. Neji.\u201d\nWhile Shino was skilled with his bugs, Neji was so skilled in taijutsu and speed it was only inevitable. Shino put on a good show though, drawing it out and showing he could fight against a stronger opponent and had the wits to draw it out longer than many others would have. Neji seemed to respect Shino by the end for he ended it swiftly and easily with no brutality in his hits.\n\u201cNext Match, Kankuro vs. Lee.\u201d\nPuppets versus brute force. Kakashi winced at the sound of cracking bones as Gai\u2019s star pupil underestimated his strength on what he thought was a puppet. Despite the broken leg the puppet-boy fought back, masterfully directing his puppet. This kid had been trained by a puppet master and not just by some mediocre ninja. He would bear keeping an eye on, especially since none of the Konoha genin would be used to fighting puppets. Kakashi watched as Lee showed off fantastic skill in Taijutsu, showed off in speed Kakashi knew no genin here could match (nor most of the chunin). Lee with his ridiculous speed could outpace the boy\u2019s chakra strings and puppet and it was a knockout match soon enough.\n\u201cYou raised a good team Gai,\u201d Kakashi said lightly, \u201cAll very strong in their own right. We\u2019ll have to see how they hold up against my own team in the finals.\u201d\nGai beamed at him, giving him a thumbs up, and there was something soft in his crinkled grin that Kakashi returned. \n\u201cNext match, Gaara vs Misumi!\u201d\nIt was done quick and hard, the poor boy had no warning before sand converged and crushed him. Hayate made an aborted movement forward and then seemed to sigh and declared Gaara the winner even as sand and blood dripped to the floor. Kakashi hid a wince and merely made a note to keep an eye on the red-head. Not that every other jonin and ANBU in the city wouldn\u2019t be after that display. \n\u201cNext match, Choji vs Naruto.\u201d\n\u201cAw man, double match!\u201d Naruto whined as he stood back up.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Kakashi pat his shoulder, \u201cRemember you already have a pass to the next round. Think of this as extra training.\u201d\nNaruto grumbled but when down and fought the boy who watched him warily, like Naruto was a dog about to bite. Kakashi wondered how much of Team Seven\u2019s fight in the Forest they had seen. In the end it wasn\u2019t a hard match for Naruto. Choji had his family technique, and when Asuma called down the promise of BBQ, he had the drive. But Naruto was quicker and it only took a few spools of his last wire and an explosive tag for Naruto to knock the boy out.\n\u201cMan, none of my students are going to make it,\u201d Asuma bemoaned. \n\u201cNone of Kurenai\u2019s did either,\u201d Kakashi pointed out, \u201cAnd only one of Gai\u2019s.\n\u201cAnd all of yours did,\u201d Asuma said meaningfully, \u201cI guess you had a right to be confident when you nominated them.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Sakura still has to fight as does Shikamaru, since they\u2019re the last two,\u201d Kakashi beamed at him.\nAsuma gave him an incredulous look and then looked at the grim ready looking Sakura to the lazy looking Nara.\n\u201cI\u2019m not putting any bets on Shikamaru,\u201d Asuma said, \u201cNot after seeing your other two students win so handily.\u201d\n\u201cMah,\u201d Kakashi flapped a hand, \u201cIt\u2019s good you recognize my superior teaching skills!\u201d\nAsuma went to say something but Hayate interrupted.\n\u201cLast match, Sakura vs Shikamaru.\u201d\nShikamaru winced despite knowing it was coming and walked down the stairs like a death march, his team yelling sympathetic encouragement. Kakashi watched out of the corner of his eye as Sakura discreetly popped the solider pill he had given her into her mouth and crunched it. \n\u201cThey saw my team\u2019s fight in the Forest?\u201d Kakashi asked Asuma lightly as Shikamaru looked grim.\nSakura lurched forward into the ring looking a tad terrifying with her blood streaked clothes and her bruises and her set expression.\n\u201cThey mentioned they saw them take down an Oto team,\u201d Asuma nodded, lighting a smoke. \nKakashi nodded, suspicions confirmed and turned to watch the match. \n\u201cHe have the Nara intelligence?\u201d \n\u201cYup,\u201d Asuma drawled, \u201cBut I heard Sakura had the highest academic grades in the academy.\u201d\n\u201cYup,\u201d Kakashi mocked.\nThey watched silently as Hayate started the match. Sakura reacted by throwing an explosive note at Shikamaru, not her usual type of move, but Kakashi could see she was appropriately wary of his shadow and had decided to disorient him and hide in the resulting smoke, fleeing a distance away. He was very proud of his students, sticking to taijutsu with a few tools thrown in. They weren\u2019t showing their hands in ninjutsu, genjutsu, or weapons. That would be good for the final round. \nWhat followed was a rather long-distance battle as Sakura refused to get close enough for Shikamaru to use his shadow, and Shikamaru was hesitant to get closer to use said shadow due to her heavy hitting. Which resulted in a kunai shuriken battle. And it was\u2026it was magnificent actually.\nWatching two people who could do high level math on trajectory, speed, distance, and such in seconds made for very interesting throws. Sakura was throwing knives at angles to ricochet to pin him down in one place while Shikamaru was practically making Sakura dance with how often she had to move, using impossible twists to avoid such odd angles. \nThe two did not bother to banter, just snatched up used knives and threw them in a display of mastery over the simple weapon every ninja carried. \nIn the end Shikamaru was more quickly winded than Sakura, huffing and sweating as he trembled, trying to hide behind the debris of her initial explosion to give himself a breather. Sakura who had retreated to the ceiling saw her opportunity and went in quick and heavy.\nShikamaru tried to use his shadow but he was tired and slow and it only latched onto her own for a brief moment before she charged through it and hit him hard enough to make him drop like a sack of rocks. \n\u201cAnd that concludes the matches,\u201d Hayate said marking something down on his clipboard, \u201cCould the victors please come down here to draw numbers.\u201d\nAll seven of the winners, including Kakashi standing in for the sleeping Sasuke, each pulled numbers out of a box, calling them out so Hayate could mark them down. Then the man held up his clipboard.\n\u201cIn one months\u2019 time we will have Stage three, the combat stage, in a tournament style. You will face an opponent and the winner will move onto the next round. This is the stage where you prove whether you truly deserve the title of chunin. You can even lose you match and still be considered so train well, not just in physical strength but in strategy. The matches for the first round are as follows; Sakura vs. Temari, Naruto vs. Neji, Sasuke vs. Lee. Gaara has a pass for the first round and will be the first fight in the second round against the winner of the Sakura vs Temari match. Dismissed.\u201d\nTemari looked particularly green around the gills, darting a glance at the redhead and Kakashi winced as well. \nKakashi looked down at the papers that had the numbers scrawled on them and his lips twitched as he caught only the faintest hint of a genjutsu on the paper. His full team had made it to the final round and while teammates fighting could be a spectacle, there was more of a political show in pitting different village\u2019s kids against one another. There had been no chance of leaving that to a luck of the draw.\nKakashi gathered his students who by now were more than dead on their feet. Sakura was the only one to make it out the door on her own two feet, the effects of the solider pill still pushing her on. Sasuke had fallen asleep after his match and when Kakashi picked him up he merely lolled. Naruto fell asleep as he was walking, two matches as well as the worrying talk of seals having exhausted him.\nKakashi draped the dark haired boy over his shoulder mindful of his ribs, tucked the blond boy under his arm, and watched Sakura carefully as they retreated to the hospital. The medic-nin here had done a job of bandaging and patching them up but Sakura and Sasuke needed a real doctor to help with their broken bones. \n.--.\nKakashi had managed to convince the nurses to put his three students in the same room in the end and thus had settled himself in a chair to keep watch as they all lay still and silent in deep sleep.\nSasuke was hooked up to an IV, the seal having done some damage to him. The fever and the resultant surge of malicious chakra not his own had ravaged his immune system apparently and he would have to be careful about not getting sick for the next few weeks. They had also taken a lot of energy out of him and he was in desperate need of nutrients. His ribs had been healed so his body didn\u2019t have to worry about that at least.\nSakura on the other hand had had some extreme swelling of her face and wrist by the time they made it to the hospital, and it had taken the medic nearly an hour to make sure he had healed everything under the swelling. Her wrist had been healed as well and she was also hooked up to an IV because solider pills took a lot out of you after the initial rush. \nNaruto was fine, just exhausted. They had told him if anyone else had had their chakra messed with to the degree the seal Orochimaru had placed, they probably would have gone into shock and their body might have started to shut down. Naruto\u2019s status as a jinchuriki had saved him that fate but he was drained. Not empty of chakra but simply exhausted. \nThe Hokage had tried to summon him for a report and Kakashi had sent a reply saying he suspected Orochimaru may send another agent after Sasuke so he was playing it safe. The fact the Hokage had not sent a reply or an order said that the man trusted Kakashi to do what needed to be done.\nKakashi knew that he would have to wake the three the next day no matter how tired they were. He needed to seal Sasuke\u2019s curse mark, needed to fix Naruto\u2019s, and then they had to start training. \nSo Kakashi watched over them carefully as they all lay exhausted and vulnerable and made plans.\n.--.\nKakashi was only lightly dozing when his instincts blared to life and woke him up. He cracked his eye open, peering about the dark hospital room only lit by the faint moonlight seeping in. There was an ANBU standing over Sasuke.\nKakashi didn\u2019t even hesitate.\nHe had already flared his chakra in an emergency pattern as he went for the stranger\u2019s throat. Maybe it was a real ANBU but none would have been stupid enough to not simply wake Kakashi instead of sneaking around. So Kakashi went for the kill, kunai whipping out and spinning straight for the vulnerable jugular. \nWhoever he was, he was good for simply having made it all the way in the room before Kakashi sensed him. But Kakashi was not renowned for no reason. The man barely had time to flinch back before Kakashi\u2019s kunai had sliced his throat open to nearly the bone. \nHe stumbled back, hand gripping the wound as blood arched across the room. Kakashi could sense the ANBU on patrol honing in on their location, could sense his students waking behind him at the level of violence in the room despite the sedatives. But Kakashi kept his eyes on the other man, noting that despite having his throat torn wide open the man had not collapsed and in fact was still moving backwards. \n\u201cHatake Kakashi,\u201d the man chuckled through a destroyed throat, \u201cI should I have known you would be here.\u201d\nKakashi gave him no chance for banter, lashing out again. The man dodged the swing of his kunai but Kakashi had been covering the movement of his other hand drawing the tanto strapped to his lower back. He went for a beheading stroke with the old white blade.\nThe man ducked under this swing, but not quick enough and for his trouble got a deep slice across his mask, cracking it right in half. Kakashi took in the sight of glasses and silver hair for barely a moment as green chakra lit the boy\u2019s hand, somehow healing his torn throat. The boy lunged to the side as Kakashi went for a double strike with both the blades in his hand. \nKakashi spun after him of course but it had been a deliberate driving swing on his part. The boy, Kabuto, if he remembered correctly, stepped back right into the blade of Kakashi\u2019s back up. Kabuto ripped himself off the blade that was straight through his heart and lashed out at the ANBU behind him.\nKakashi had torn his throat open and this ANBU had destroyed his heart and the kid was brushing these attacks off like they were mere papercuts. \nThe ANBU dodged his retaliation, carefully redirecting swings that would have come too close to the kids in the hospital beds. But Kabuto wasn\u2019t focused on them it seemed as he made a break for the window. Not focusing on the kids was a mistake because as Kabuto leapt over one bed, diving for the window, Sakura\u2019s hand snapped out, grabbing him by the ankle.\nKakashi saw his ankle shatter as Sakura clenched her fist, bringing him down. He rolled out of her grip of course, like she hadn\u2019t shattered his ankle, and stood, his escape cut off by the new ANBU on the window sill. He was surrounded now, looking between Kakashi and the two ANBU trying to find the weak link.\n\u201cPin him down,\u201d Kakashi ordered, voice dark and commanding.\nThe ANBU didn\u2019t even hesitate, going for the boy. Kabuto fought well. Far too well. But even he could not fight off two ANBU in a narrow space as they went for all his vitals. Then Sakura and Sasuke joined the fray. They couldn\u2019t rip themselves from the IVs and the beds but they threw genjutsu at the man, expertly layering the low level genjutsu in tandem. Kabuto could obviously break out of them but that took precious time and focus, because they could just keep reapplying them. \nAnd then there were the blow darts to considered, which no one had. Naruto landed five darts to Kabuto before he had even realized what was happening. They were coated in a paralytic Sakura had made which Kakashi doubted would do anything to a man who could heal a destroyed heart. But genjutsu, paralytic, and two ANBU proved to be too much for the boy and he was faltering. \nKakashi waited for his opening, careful and considering and patient. And when it presented itself Kakashi shoved an armful of lightening through the boy\u2019s stomach, making sure to rip it up and destroy the majority of his internal organs. For good measure his tanto followed, beheading the kid. \nSilence rang through the room as Kakashi let the chidori fade away taking the noise with it. \n\u201cKeep his head separate,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cBurn the body.\u201d\n\u201cWe could study it,\u201d one of the ANBU said.\n\u201cBurn the body,\u201d Kakashi repeated turning to face the masked man.\nHe made his posture tall and imposing, kept a threat in his voice and gave the ANBU such a cold glare the man bowed. Kakashi did not want to see if the boy could reattach his own head and regrow organs. Each ANBU took a part and vanished out the window. Kakashi turned to his students. Sakura was already out again, passed out from chakra use of her already depleted stores. Sasuke had followed after her. Naruto was awake still, holding his blow dart in his hand tightly. \n\u201cGood job,\u201d Kakashi told him softly in the silence. \n\u201cI\u2019m not tired anymore,\u201d Naruto said staring at the blow dart.\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay up to guard.\u201d\nBut Naruto shook his head and leaned against the headboard. Kakashi sighed and finally turned towards the door where the medic-nin was calmly sending out a chakra pulsed Morse code. Kakashi flared his own chakra in the all-clear signal. He felt all the medic nin and ninja on duty in the hospital start to move. He was glad to see they were as efficient as ever in cases of emergency lockdown.\n.--.\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u2019 Kakashi asked, because every moment was a learning moment.\nNaruto scrunched his nose, furrowed his brow, and flipped the seal upside-down. \n\u201cWon\u2019t work,\u201d he finally said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been used before,\u201d Kakashi pointed out, \u201cIt\u2019s helped.\u201d\n\u201cHelped, but not worked,\u201d Naruto shrugged, \u201cIt wears thin too quickly.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you suggest then?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Naruto said sheepishly.\nSasuke snorted from the circle.\n\u201cHey! Just cause I\u2019m not a master yet doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not better than you!\u201d Naruto howled.\n\u201cStill useless then,\u201d Sasuke snorted.\nNaruto steamed beside him but Kakashi could see there was no real heat in their words. They were just being bratty kids. Kakashi sighed and looked at the seal again. They needed to do something about Sasuke\u2019s seal, but Naruto was right, despite his prodigious speed in learning seals, he was not a master. \nKakashi sighed. Well, they\u2019d use what they had for now. And he had an idea of what to focus on with Naruto for the next month. \nKakashi shooed Naruto away from the circle so they could temporarily seal Sasuke\u2019s curse mark. The ANBU watching from the shadows barely even shifted as Naruto grumbled. Kakashi gave the shadows a faint nod as Sasuke collapsed. The ANBU that would be tagging the kid for the next few days followed him as he tucked Sasuke back in his hospital bed. Sakura was still asleep from the night before and didn\u2019t even stir as her team entered the room again. Naruto climbed back into his own bed with only one stern look from Kakashi. The boy must be tired if he gave up so little of a fight. Kakashi rewarded him by pulling out a scroll on sealing. It had some notes on the seal that had been used to cut Naruto off from his chakra that they had lifted earlier. \nToday was rest day after all the sealing business. Tomorrow would be business. \n.--.\n\u201cSo, what do you think we need to focus on for the exam?\u201d Kakashi asked his students.\nHis kids were sunning themselves on the large flat rocks of Training ground seventeen, all dressed in civilian clothes. Bandages were still visible beneath the shorts and t-shirts they had all raided Naruto\u2019s closet for. They would have to look into replacing their outfits because they would have to look presentable for the final match, but that was for later. \n\u201cI\u2019m gonna need to do something about Neji\u2019s poky thing,\u201d Naruto said, eyes closed, \u201cSakura said it cuts off chakra. So I was thinking ninjutsu! Then I can keep him at a distance!\u201d\n\u201cMaybe mix in some exploding seals and smoke bombs and traps,\u201d Sakura added, looking completely relaxed with her limbs sprawled awkwardly. \n\u201cOkay, so traps and ninjutsu for Naruto,\u201d Kakashi nodded, \u201cAnd some seals. We\u2019ll add to your repertoire. Sasuke?\u201d\n\u201cLee is fast,\u201d Sasuke grunted, rolling to better get the sun on his face, \u201cAnd strong. I\u2019d counter with genjutsu.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Lee can\u2019t access his chakra for jutsu. He has a condition that means he can only use it passively in his body for things like water-walking but can\u2019t retaliate with any jutsu. He can disrupt his chakra enough to throw genjutsu, so we should work on layering,\u201d Kakashi nodded from where he was similarly sprawled on the nice warm rock. \u201cSakura?\u201d\nThe sound of the creek to the left was a happy burble as Sakura took a moment to think of her answer. Naruto was always quick with his thoughts, blurting them out. Sasuke was a tad more thoughtful but didn\u2019t want to look like it took too long to get an answer, so he was usually a little slower but firmer in his thoughts. Sakura however, liked to really think about it if she had the luxury and time to do so. In a fight they were much quicker, but they also recognized how down time and how time-restraints affected their reactions. Sakura liked to be thorough. \nKakashi and the boys let her have her minute as they laid in the sun, enjoying the warmth and the sprawl of their tired bodies. \n\u201cTemari is a wind user,\u201d Sakura said finally. \u201cSo ideally, I\u2019d use earth jutsu to go after her. If I use jutsu. I think I\u2019d rather use taijutsu or genjutsu instead of trying to do a ninjutsu battle.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll focus on taijutsu for you,\u201d Kakashi agreed, \u201cBut you\u2019ll also work on genjutsu with Sasuke. Your second match is the one that worries me the most.\u201d\nAll his kids opened their eyes and exchanged uneasy looks. \n\u201cGaara is \u2026dangerous,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cAnd if it comes down to it, I want you to surrender.\u201d\nSakura nodded grimly and Kakashi was quite proud of the fact she accepted such a pride-hurting order.\n\u201cFight him for a bit, show off your skills, but remember; winning isn\u2019t better than surviving.\u201d\nShe nodded a little more easily this time and Naruto gave her a clap on the back from where he could reach\n\u201cWe believe in you Sakura! But we want you alive too!\u201d\nShe smiled at him and Kakashi rolled over to hand out hair ruffles.\n\u201cOkay team. So we have a plan for each of you at least then. Sakura, I have someone I think can help you with taijutsu in the morning. Naruto, I know someone in town who can help you with some more seals after I help you ninjutsu. Sasuke, I\u2019m decent with genjutsu but I have a friend I can rope into helping a bit as well. Let\u2019s lay out a schedule.\u201d\nThey rolled closer and Kakashi unrolled a scroll to start laying out the next month\u2019s schedule. Sakura would go to Gai in the mornings while Kakashi worked on ninjutsu with Sasuke and Naruto, then in the afternoon Naruto would go do sealing with Jiraya if he could rope the Sage into it, while Sakura and Sasuke did some genjutsu under a friend of Kakashi\u2019s. Then in the evening they would do some light sparing and team exercises. Kakashi had also signed Sasuke and Sakura up for some first-aid and medic training on the weekends (not that they knew that yet) and he\u2019d arranged for Naruto to spend some time with someone who could help him work on traps. \nCompared to their months in the forests and Wave it was a light, focused load. But compared to what he knew the other teams would be doing, it was a tad excessive. But Kakashi was past worrying about what they could handle. His team was going to learn and they were going to learn quick.\nBecause there was more than just the exam at stake here. \n.--.\n\u201cGai,\u201d Kakashi waved.\n\u201cMY ETERNAL RIVAL!\u201d Gai spazed, \u201cYou Are Seeking Me out!?\u201d\nWhich was, admittedly, a rare occurrence when in public.\nKakashi kept a firm hold on Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s shoulders. They were the most likely to bolt. Sakura would plan her exit much more carefully and that gave him a few moments at least. \n\u201cI want you to meet my students.\u201d\n\u201cGREETINGS! It is an honor to meet the students of my Eternal Rival!\u201d Gai boomed, striking a nice guy pose.\n\u201cHello,\u201d Sakura greeted nervously, far politer than the gaping boys.\n\u201cThis is Sakura, Sasuke, and Naruto,\u201d Kakashi beamed at them like he was showing off a prize pie at the fair, \u201cI was wondering if you would like to see Sakura spar.\u201d\nGai tilted his head like a giant weird bird and raised a brow at Kakashi. Kakashi raised a brow back. \n\u201cLEE!\u201d\n\u201cYes sensei!\u201d Lee appeared, saluting.\nHis teammates followed more slow, curious at the call.\n\u201cThis is my Eternal Rival! Hatake Kakashi!\u201d Gai beamed, \u201cAnd his precious students, Sakura, Naruto, and Sasuke!\u201d\n\u201cHello! I am Gai\u2019s pupil Lee!\u201d Lee beamed. \n\u201cAnd these are Neji and Tenten,\u201d Gai grinned, \u201cDo you feel up to a spar Lee?!\u201d\n\u201cYOSH! Let us explode in youth!\u201d Lee pumped a fist into the air, \u201cI have long wanted to face the rookie of the year! The Genius Uchiha! Let us see which is stronger, genius or hard work!\u201d\nAnd then his eyes fell on Sakura and the boy lit with a blush. Kakashi had a premonition of something bad and shuddered, tightening his grip on the squirming boys. \n\u201cMy Beautiful Blossom! May I have the honor of a date after the spar! I will protect you with my life!\u201d\nHe blew a kiss at her. Sasuke and Naruto stopped trying to get away and stilled, focusing eerily similar looks on the boy while Sakura quelled a shudder at the same time as Kakashi. \n\u201cUm, Sorry Lee, but I\u2019m not interested in Dating right now,\u201d Sakura said meekly, looking up at Kakashi desperately, \u201cAnd um, I\u2019ll be sparing you, not Sasuke.\u201d\nNeji scoffed beside Gai.\n\u201cCareful of her kunai,\u201d Neji sneered mockingly. \nSasuke and Naruto switched focus with the same silent look. Kakashi turned a flat look on Gai that said \u2018control your student now, or mine will murder him\u2019. Gai gave a half hearted shrug but shifted closer to Neji. \n\u201cYosh! You are a youthful blossom!\u201d Lee grinned, \u201cLet us spar so I may show you my strength!\u201d\nSakura twitched. Kakashi knew the boy was just trying to show off, not make it sound like he doubted her. He would pay for it anyways though. \n\u201cTaijutsu only,\u201d Kakashi said, dragging Naruto and Sasuke back, \u201cYou may be opponents in the finals, so no need to show all the tricks.\u201d\nGai and his other two students stepped back out of the way as well as Lee and Sakura bowed to each other respectfully.\nThe look of shock on Gai and Lee\u2019s face as Sakura mirrored the boy\u2019s pose made Kakashi grin. \n\u201cBegin!\u201d Kakashi cheered.\nLee had spent a year under Gai\u2019s tutelage, with no distractions in the form of ninjutsu\u2019s or genjutsu. The fact he was dedicated meant many more hours under his belt. He also had more experience in the field. \nBut Sakura, little pretty pink Sakura, had spent six months in Kakashi\u2019s personally built isolationist training. Many would have looked at his training plans, looked how he ran his kids into the ground every day of the week for months straight with every break having a mind game behind it, looked at how he dedicated a clone to each kid, every day, looked at how he let them focus on almost nothing but being a good team and good ninja; and many would have run away screaming, they would have baulked, they would have dropped out of the program. The Hokage himself had remarked the plan was brutal. \nKakashi had been more concerned with making sure his kids lived than coming out unharmed. \nSo Sakura and Sasuke and Naruto, all isolated from the rest of the population of Konoha, from the measuring growth of their peers, did not even consider that they were leagues above their former classmates. They had not seen their classmates in so long that there had been no measuring stick against their own growth but themselves. And when you measured yourself against an ANBU captain genius ninja, a jinchuriki with Uzumaki blood, a genius Uchiha, and a girl with the best chakra control to come out of the academy in the past decade, well\u2026\nTo his cute little students, their growth had seemed normal, maybe even a slow when they looked at their teammates and saw the leaps they made. Sakura especially had struggled to keep up, never once thinking no one had ever believed she could keep up. \nSo his cute little student lined up against Gai\u2019s star pupil, and proceed to beat the shit out of him.\nOh Lee gave as good as he got but still had shock flare when she countered a move perfectly, or when she spun in a perfect high kick of the Iron First style. They clashed in brutal fast hits, and though Lee had her beat in speed, Sakura to the shock of everyone watching but Kakashi, beat him in strength behind her attacks. \nIt only took five minutes for Lee to finally stop being shocked and return her blows with enthusiasm. \nKakashi could see, from how the boy moved, that he had to be wearing weights. And Kakashi was sure the Iron Fist was not all Gai had taught his students, but for the moment, locked in battle that was all the kid showed. Sakura similarly restrained herself to the style as well. Kakashi was not being biased when he said they were well matched, but if Sakura could have used her genjutsu of few ninjutsu or weapons, she would have edged the boy out. Maybe. If the boy didn\u2019t take his weights off at least.\nAs it was they were both flagging after an intense match and Lee was proving to have slightly more stamina than Sakura (but just slightly). \nKakashi and Gai both called the match when Sakura stumbled and missed a punch, her fist hitting the ground and cratering it. Kakashi saw her stumble, saw Lee already in position to retaliate and winced, calling the match at the same moment Gai did, seeing the same thing. Lee was already in the swing though and even as he tried to stop he nailed Sakura with a spinning kick. He had cut some of the momentum, but Sakura still went flying. \nKakashi plucked her out of the air deftly, using the momentum to flip them back to the ground. He set her down carefully, watching as her legs trembled before she found her feet. \n\u201cGood job,\u201d Kakashi murmured, patting her head.\nSakura beamed up at him through her still bruised face. Lee had been polite enough not to strike out at her former injuries at least.\n\u201cGood match,\u201d Sakura warbled, holding out an arm.\n\u201cGood match!\u201d Lee said grasping the hold.\nThe boy had stars in his eyes and Kakashi could see Sakura shaking with adrenaline and exhaustion. They would make good sparing partners. \n\u201cHow would you feel about having Sakura join you in the mornings?\u201d Kakashi asked of Gai.\nGai grinned widely at him.\n.--.\n\u201cThis is Yugao,\u201d Kakashi introduced. \nSasuke scrutinized her silently and she returned the favor. The quiet kunoichi would be a good teacher for his quietest student. They both had a rather quiet, watchful personality and seemed aloof to many others in their silent observations. \n\u201cShe will be coming as often as she can spare to give you guys some genjutsu lessons,\u201d Kakashi chirped.\nYugao was stuck in Konoha for the time being for the chunin exams and Kakashi had traded in a bunch of favors to get her to agree to this. Including asking the Hokage to count it as teaching hours for her, which was good for a variety of things in your file.\n\u201cNaruto, why don\u2019t we give Sakura and Sasuke some time with Yugao,\u201d Kakashi said, steering Naruto away.\n\u201cGood luck!\u201d Naruto waved enthusiastically at the two.\nSakura gave him a thumbs-up while Sasuke canted his head just the slightest, eyes still focused on the stranger. Kakashi was proud to note Sasuke also had Sakura in his line of vision, watching carefully over her. His cute little students had all become a tad more protective since the Forest of Death and Kakashi was not discouraging them from that.\n\u201cWho are we going to find?\u201d Naruto asked as they slipped out of the clearing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a man in town that\u2019s quite good at sealing,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cI thought you and I could go brush up on some lessons.\u201d\nNaruto brightened and absently reached out, taking Kakashi\u2019s hand in his own. Kakashi allowed it, letting the boy swing their arms as they leisurely ambled for the hot springs. Kakashi wandered up to the public bathhouse and then veered, tugging Naruto around the corner where they stepped lightly through the bush. Kakashi let go of Naruto\u2019s hands and made a shushing sound as they crept up around the back of the onsen, smothering his chakra. He felt Naruto copying him; that skill had taken weeks to beat into Naruto, but now he could snuff his chakra down to a flicker, like a bird or a rabbit.\nNaruto stared wide eyed at the man crouched, peeking. Kakashi stepped lightly up behind Jiraya and then reached out, clamping a hand on his shoulder. Jiraya shrieked like a banshee at the surprise and Naruto started roaring with laughter even as the women in the onsen realized they had a peeping tom. \n\u201cJiraya-sama, what an unusual place to find you,\u201d Kakashi smiled at the man who spun to face him. \n\u201cKakashi!\u201d Jiraya grinned, \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\n\u201cKakashi, you have two seconds to explain.\u201d\nAll three of the males swiveled to look at Kurenai glaring murder at them over the fence.\n\u201cMah, just dealing with a Peeping Tom,\u201d Kakashi smiled at the fellow jonin instructor, \u201cWould you like the first couple of hits?\u201d\nJiraya tried to yelp out his innocence but Kurenai had no patience for it and whipped a pail at his head hard and fast. The legendary sannin went down with a large mark now marring his forehead. \n\u201cThanks!\u201d Kakashi chirped. \n\u201cGet him out of here,\u201d Kurenai sneered.\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d Kakashi mock saluted, \u201cBy the way, Yugao is giving my students a few pointers on genjutsu for a couple afternoons if you feel like possibly lending a hand.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll come discuss it when I\u2019m not in the bath,\u201d the woman scowled at him.\n\u201cFair,\u201d Kakashi said, grabbing Jiraya by the back of his shirt, \u201cCome on Naruto!\u201d\nNaruto was still giggling as Kakashi dragged Jiraya out of the area and into a training ground that contained a small river. Kakashi dropped Jiraya and glanced around as Naruto stared at the water.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go for a dip,\u201d Kakashi suggested.\nNaruto grinned and shucked most of his clothes in two seconds flat, running to dive into the water. Unlike his teammates he had no more injuries or bandages to worry about getting wet either. Kakashi indulged it because it was a rather warm day and they had done some training earlier with ninjutsu. A few streaks of soot still marred Naruto\u2019s hair and he was happy enough to take a swim. He had also picked up on Kakashi\u2019s subtle hint to get out of hearing range.\nAs soon as the boy was under the water Jiraya sat up rubbing at the mark on his forehead.\n\u201cHow do you always get away with being in the same place as me when I get caught?\u201d Jiraya grumbled.\n\u201cBecause I\u2019ve never made a habit of peeping,\u201d Kakashi smirked, \u201cMy only vice is reading badly written porn.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d Jiraya yelped, \u201cThat\u2019s the finest porn in the elemental countries!\u201d\nKakashi gave a mock-shrug and Jiraya grumbled. He did so love getting under people\u2019s skin. \n\u201cSo, Naruto,\u201d Kakashi said.\nJiraya straightened, eyes flickering over to the blonde that was splashing off to the side.\n\u201cYou want me to teach him I take it?\u201d Jiraya grumbled, \u201cI suppose I can take him for the month and teach him summoning-\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kakashi cut him off quick and harsh.\nJiraya blinked, caught off guard by the rather stone-like tone Kakashi had taken. Kakahsi was not going to give an inch in this though. It was not a negotiation and he would not allow it to become one.\n\u201cWe are here to request some sealing lessons, nothing more,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cNo summoning.\u201d\nJiraya eyed him for a long moment but Kakashi held his gaze, face set.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have him sign the Toad summons one day,\u201d Jiraya pointed out, \u201cWhy not now?\u201d\n\u201cWe are working on different skills right now. Besides, he doesn\u2019t have the chakra control to be summoning any large helpful toads.\u201d\n\u201cHe would have enough chakra despite the lack of control if he taped the Kyuubi chakra.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kakashi growled.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to have to learn at some point.\u201d\n\u2018No,\u201d Kakashi repeated, \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand what\u2019s happening here. Naruto is my student. Mine. And thus I decide what he learns.\u201d\nJiraya stared at Kakashi as if he had never seen him before.\n\u201cI had already planned to take him as my apprentice,\u201d Jiraya said, \u201cYou know this.\u201d\nAnd long ago Kakashi had agreed with the idea. Before he had become Naruto\u2019s sensei, he had hoped Jiraya would take Naruto out of Konoha, would teach him same as his father. But Kakashi had had the kid for less than a year and knew he was attached. Naruto would be leaving Team Seven over his dead body. \n\u201cPlans have changed,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201che\u2019s my student now.\u201d\n\u201cBe reasonable Kakashi,\u201d Jiraya argued, \u201cHe will need to learn how to harness the Kyuubi eventually.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kakashi glared, \u201chis father did fine without it and bijuu chakra. Kushina never touched its chakra. Naruto will be better than both of them and he won\u2019t need to touch a drop of the corrupted thing\u2019s chakra.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what does Sarutobi think of that?\u201d Jiraya raised a brow, a challenge in his words.\n\u201cThe Hokage has given named Naruto my student,\u201d Kakashi snapped, \u201cHe trusted me to decide how best to train him.\u201d\nJiraya and Kakashi had a bit of a stare off and Kakashi could see the plans forming in Jiraya\u2019s head. Jiraya would be paying a visit to the Sandaime but Kakashi knew he would not get the answer he desired. If Jiraya had been truly interested in Naruto he would have been there for the boy. He would have swept him away as soon as he graduated not waited for a jonin to train him for a year. He was only interested in Naruto for his legacy and Kakashi wasn\u2019t going to let the man fashion a new Namikaze Minato out of him. Naruto deserved more than that. He also deserved more than to have all his skills and struggles pushed aside to be simply the Kyuubi jinchuriki. \n\u201cSealing, eh?\u201d Jiraya finally sighed, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll give you a few lessons at least.\u201d\nIt was not surrender but an argument pushed aside. Kakashi backed down knowing this wouldn\u2019t be the end of it. \n\u201cNaruto!\u201d Kakashi called, \u201cCome join us!\u201d\nNaruto flopped out of the water and then flopped down beside Kakashi still in just his shorts and dripping wet.\n\u201cGonna show us some cool seals, Mr. pervert?\u201d Naruto grinned. \n\u201cI\u2019m not a pervert!\u201d Jiraya spluttered, \u201cI\u2019m a super pervert!\u201d\nKakashi rolled his eyes for Naruto\u2019s benefit as the boy giggled. Jiraya grumbled at the laughter but sat back down and true to his word gave them a lesson on seals, eyes brightening as he realized Naruto truly had a knack for them. Soon they were deep in theory, Jiraya having summoned a toad to bring him his scrolls. Kakashi tried to keep up but fell behind half way through the first lecture, instead turning to focus on his own thing as Naruto babbled.\nKakashi also made a mental note to talk to Naruto about what Jiraya wanted from him. Jiraya would find no support in the Sandaime at this crucial time and would most likely turn to trying to cajole Naruto into lessons. Kakashi wanted Naruto to be fully informed before he made decisions. \n.--.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to learn it,\u201d Sasuke said.\nKakashi watched as the sharingan faded away.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked calmly.\nSasuke looked away for a long moment. Kakashi wondered if when the kid looked in a mirror and saw the sharingan he saw his brother looming over him as he murdered his parents. He wondered if Sasuke saw Itachi in himself and it scared him. \nProbably. \nSasuke, for all he was stoic up front, was a sensitive boy. That came hand in hand when you witnessed trauma, unless you became unhinged that was. There would always be triggers, would always be this fear and this hate clinging to his nerves. He was too emotional to ever be truly stoic under the surface. The question was always if that would change to empathy or anger, if he would by sympathetic to others, or start to see less value in them because of his own hurt. \nKakashi was here to guide him towards empathy. \n\u201cHe is too good with it. I won\u2019t be able to catch up,\u201d Sasuke finally said, \u201cIt will just be a handicap. I want to be good without it. You have it but you are still a genius without it.\u201d\nKakashi felt a swell of pride, even if it was only half an excuse to avoid saying he was scared of his own eyes, and reached out to ruffle his hair. \n\u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d Kakashi said honestly.\nSasuke peeked up as if to gauge his truthfulness, and then ducked his head. Kakashi caught the faint hint of pink on the boy\u2019s ears and smiled again. His student, the worst at showing outwards emotion unless backed into a corner, was doing well.\n\u201cHow about we focus on some more ninjutsu. I know for a fact that your brother is a fire affinity and relies mainly on fire ninjutsu and genjutsu. Let\u2019s polish up your lightening.\u201d\nSasuke gave a nod and peeked up at him again.\n\u201cAnd when you are ready, we\u2019ll work on the sharingan because it is still a tool to be proficient in, like your bow and like your satsuma.\u201d\nHe agreed carefully and Kakashi smiled, even if the expression was a tad sad. He would have to learn or it would be a double edged sword. Kakashi knew that well enough. \n.--.\nKakashi glanced up at the faint knock on his door and flickered his chakra very faintly in response. The door creaked open and Kakashi looked back at the scroll in front of him as Gai toed his sandals off and quietly closed the door. Kakashi smirked faintly knowing Gai was only being quiet because Kakashi\u2019s neighbor intimidated him. His friend had been too loud too late one day and the old woman next door had given him such a tongue lashing that Gai had avoided Kakashi\u2019s apartment for months. Gai was not use to being scolded, too bright and happy for most to take offense and too \u2026much for people to even approach him with a scolding. \n\u201cThere\u2019s some tea on the stove if you want some,\u201d Kakashi said idly.\nGai blinked and then grinned as he tip toed over to the stove. Kakashi slid his feet off the second chair and toed it out from the table for Gai to flop into.\n\u201cHow have you been?\u201d Kakashi asked blandly.\n\u201cVery well!\u201d Gai boomed at a whisper, \u201cI chanced upon passing by the Hatake Compound on my way here.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes, it\u2019s only twenty minutes out of your way but you happened to chance upon it,\u201d Kakashi said drolly. \nGai winked, entirely unashamed. But then he sobered, face going thoughtful as he eyed Kakashi. Kakashi flickered his glance at the man and then straightened, rolling the scroll shut. While a quiet Gai was not entirely unknown to his friends, it often a precursor to serious conversation, \n\u201cI am surprised you reopened the Hatake compound,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNaruto\u2019s apartment was atrocious,\u201d Kakashi said automatically, \u201cAnd Sasuke was living in a house full of ghosts.\u201d\n\u201cI am not surprised you did it for them,\u201d Gai corrected, \u201cI am simply surprised you opened it and did not return to it yourself.\n\u201cYou know it holds bad memories for me,\u201d Kakashi said flatly. \nIt had been over just twenty years since his father committed suicide and Kakashi could still remember the way the blood seeped across the tatami mats and the way his father\u2019s hair had turned pink with it. \n\u201cI would think, three young children would be able to chase that gloom away,\u201d Gai said sipping at his tea.\nWhich\u2026.which was actually true. They were the only reason Kakashi could stand to be there. And to be honest, well, when he was there now-a-days, it was full of warmth and noise and Kakashi almost forgot it had ever been a shadow on him. \n\u201cYour students,\u201d Gai said softly, \u201cThey have changed you Kakashi.\u201d\n\u201cHave they?\u201d Kakashi asked automatically.\n\u201cYes. And for the better I think,\u201d Gai smiled.\n\u201cI\u2019ve only had them less than a year,\u201d Kakashi argued. \n\u201cAnd yet I can see the change,\u201d Gai smiled warmly at him. \nKakashi looked away. He knew\u2026well he knew he had become more active since taking them on. He\u2019d had to to keep up. But \u2026was he really changed? Not that he disbelieved Gai. If anyone could see changes it would be Gai. \n\u201cI\u2026I think I like it,\u201d Kakashi admitted, \u201cThey\u2026\u201d\nHe paused and Gai didn\u2019t interrupt his thoughts, just watched him with a soft smile.\n\u201cThey brought back some purpose into my life,\u201d Kakashi admitted quietly, like it was a secret.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Gai beamed, eyes crinkling happily. \nKakashi looked down at his own tea and Gai sipped his. They had; they had drawn out new purpose in his life and Kakashi was \u2026he was very grateful actually.\n\u201cHow is Sakura doing with you?\u201d Kakashi asked to deflect the conversation. \nEnough about all the soft warm feelings inside of him now. \n\u201cVery well!\u201d Gai beamed, \u201cShe is taking to the Iron Fist style like a fish to water!\u201d\n\u201cSorry I didn\u2019t ask before teaching her your family style,\u201d Kakashi cleared his throat, \u201cBut I assumed\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou are free to assume!\u201d Gai smiled, \u201cI have often called you my brother and so it is your style as well! Besides, I am the last of the Maito family, why should a style end with me? No, it belongs to Konoha now and Sakura will carry it forward for me, just like Lee.\u201d\nKakashi smiled at Gai and wondered how such a kind man could be such a ruthless shinobi. That was the dichotomy of the shinobi life he supposed. \n\u201cAnd how is she doing with\u2026the crush Lee has?\u201d\nGai suddenly wilted.\n\u201cI\u2026she does not return his feelings,\u201d Gai sighed, \u201cAnd I have tried to encourage Lee to give her time but he seems to have misinterpreted that as he must keep trying for as long as it takes for her to say yes.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Kakashi sighed, \u201cSakura is a very definitive girl; if she has said no now, it is unlikely her answer will change. If Lee keeps bothering her we may need to intervene. While I would like her to deal with her own problems, I won\u2019t have anyone making her uncomfortable.\u201d\n\u201cAs is right,\u201d Gai sighed as well, \u201cIf it comes to a point I will make sure Lee understands he needs to stop.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Kakashi said. \n\u201cHow is the training month going?\u201d Gai asked, changing the subject.\nThey drank tea late into the night, relaxing together as Kakashi explained his training routine. Gai exchanged some tip and somehow bullied Kakashi into joining him for spars and workouts early in the morning on the odd day while a clone would be sent to help the boys; just to see if he was still as \u2018hip\u2019 and \u2018youthful\u2019 as usual. Kakashi didn\u2019t know how Gai had talked him around to agreeing but he didn\u2019t regret that. Yet.\n.--.\nKakashi side-eyed Hayate as he sat on a log, watching Yugao greet Sakura and Sasuke. Sakura was already asking Yugao a question she had thought up in the night about genjutsu while Sasuke lingered close enough to hear the answer. Kakashi would bet Sasuke was the one who had formed that question first and somehow connived Sakura into asking. Sasuke liked to keep quiet these days and his teammates helped enable that by understanding him so well he didn\u2019t even have to say it outright. Kakashi might have to stop encouraging that. \nBut for now, he had Hayate to deal with. He doubted the man was here to simply watch and lounge in the sun. \n\u201cAre you okay going to meet Jiraya on your own today?\u201d Kakashi asked Naruto, \u201cI need to have a word with Hayate.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Naruto shrugged, \u201cWe were working on this awesome sealing scroll yesterday that we\u2019ll probably finish.\u201d\n\u201cMah, you\u2019re already leagues ahead of me,\u201d Kakashi ruffled his hair.\n\u201cAm not,\u201d Naruto grinned, \u201cBut I\u2019m catching up to you, old man!\u201d\nKakashi laughed and shooed him off, meandering over to Hayate as Sakura yelled something and her and Sasuke started arguing over theory. Yugao watched with a patient eye. \n\u201cYo, how\u2019s it going Hayate,\u201d Kakashi smiled as he slouched over.\n\u201cCame to see what was keeping Yugao busy in the afternoons,\u201d Hayate coughed lightly, \u201cI also heard some rumors that you bared your fangs recently.\u201d\nKakashi winced and gave a sigh before tugging the tanto strapped across his lower back free. The sword had been picked up on a whim when he had started teaching the kids about weapons, because he couldn\u2019t appear to be a hypocrite when he told them to carry their own weapons and didn\u2019t carry one of his own. After Kabuto, well, he had realized it might be in his best interest to keep it on himself more regularly. The white blade glinted in the light and Hayate gave a low whistle.\n\u201cSo you really did pick up your father\u2019s White Fang again,\u201d he said.\n\u201cChakra blades are expensive,\u201d Kakashi said simply, \u201cWhy buy a new one when I had an old one already broken in?\u201d\n\u201cBeen a while since I\u2019ve seen you with any blades though,\u201d Hayate smirked.\nKakashi simply smiled at him and didn\u2019t mention it had been since he had been in ANBU. \n\u201cSpar?\u201d Hayate grinned.\nNow Kakashi really did wince. Hayate was the best swordsmen in Konoha for a reason and Kakashi had barely touched a blade in seven years.\n\u201cSpar,\u201d he agreed with a sigh. \nHe might be taking a break from sealing lessons with Naruto to get his own lessons it seemed. \n.--.\n\u201cStand still!\u201d Sakura howled.\n\u201cNyeh!\u201d Naruto stuck out his tongue, fingers wiggling stupidly.\nHe yelped as Sakura changed directions suddenly and her hammer lashed out, slamming into him. With a pop the clone vanished in a cloud of smoke. Sakura used the momentum of the spin to send her straight into the next clone. Multiple Naruto\u2019s cursed and dove away as Sakura came after them, flipping into the air and using her own body weight to slam her hammer down hard enough to leave a crater. \n\u201cNot going to join them?\u201d Kakashi asked, deflecting Sasuke\u2019s Satsuma with a kunai.\nSasuke sent him a look like he was crazy. Kakashi supposed that Sakura and Naruto\u2019s deranged game of whack-a-mole might look a little too crazy. Sakura gave a shout as Naruto used his chain to grab her hammer out of the air and slam it into the ground, which consequently slammed Sakura into the ground because she had refused to let go.\n\u201cSakura,\u201d he chided as he dodged a stab from Sasuke, \u201cYou get broken fingers from holding onto a weapon in that situation, best let it go and retrieve it later. You\u2019re not a samurai depending on his weapon, you are a ninja; adapt.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sensei,\u201d Sakura groaned levering herself out of her crater.\nNaruto was laughing at her but cut off abruptly with a shriek as a Naginata nearly took off a clone\u2019s head.\n\u201cMind if I join this spar?\u201d Kotetsu grinned.\nNaruto scrambled away as Izumo lashed-out out of nowhere as well. Sakura and Naruto scrambled away and started to retaliate as the chunin pair took out a score of clones. \n\u201cBest go help your teammates,\u201d Kakashi smiled.\nSasuke had barely waited for the command and went spinning after Kotetsu as the man pulled his spear out of a post. While three near chunin with good teamwork could take out a pair of chunin with some good planning and ridiculous strength, this pair was no ordinary chunin. Kotetsu and Izumo had some of the best teamwork in Konoha and were never sent on missions without the other. They had often taken out jonin together and were a force to be reckoned with. They kept ahead of Team seven by just enough to tease them. It was a good work out for the pair but there was no denial that they would win. \nKakashi watched a long moment then gave an unholy smirk and leapt into the fray. But he didn\u2019t join his own team. Nor the chunin. Instead he decided to take them all on and soon enough they were all screaming in surprise, trying to evade him. While his kids were good, and the other two had experience facing jonin, Kakashi was not an ordinary jonin. \nBy the end of the session, as the sun was setting on the horizon, the kids were tangled in a heap with the other two. \n\u201cWell, wasn\u2019t that fun,\u201d Kakashi said brightly from where he sat on top of them.\nThey all groaned.\n.--.\nKakashi awoke to sharp banging on his front apartment door. He groaned and rolled out of bed already sensing the familiar chakra of his students. He really should just give up and move into the Hatake compound despite his hang-ups. The kids always invaded his apartments the few times he stayed there. And his ninken didn\u2019t even bother coming to it anymore, spending all their time in the extra rooms and the yard of the Hatake manor. \nKakashi diverted to the kitchen to flick the switch on his tea kettle as the kids let themselves in, falling over themselves as they kicked sandals off at the door. Or well, two of them did. Kakashi saw and sensed Sakura make a beeline for Kakashi with a look of rage on her face. \nKakashi straightened at the look.\n\u201cSakura, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, tone calm even as he braced his feet.\nHe let old habits of being battle-ready even in conversation slip in as he was prepared to be off like a shot in a moment\u2019s notice. Not because of Sakura, but because of what ever had made her angry.\n\u201cSensei,\u201d Sakura said, anger bubbling in her voice.\nShe struggled for the words, looking angry and frustrated and helpless and Kakashi watched her face shift even as Sasuke and Naruto peeked around the kitchen doorway carefully. Sakura burst into tears.\n\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Kakashi tried soothingly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cNo it\u2019s not!\u201d Sakura shrieked.\nKakashi realized they were angry tears, born of frustrated hopelessness and Kakashi despaired at what had driven the emotional girl to it. Sakura glared at him with tears and Kakashi knew she wasn\u2019t glaring at him.\n\u201cHow about we all sit in the living room and I\u2019ll make tea,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cAnd then you can explain what\u2019s wrong at\u2026\u201d\nHe glanced at the clock on the wall and winced.\n\u201cAt 3am.\u201d\nNaruto leapt forward and grabbed Sakura to guide her to the couch as she made frustrated little noises and cried. Sasuke was right up in their personal space, not touching but looming over them almost protectively. Kakashi made a show of locking the front door and resetting his traps, checking windows to do the same. It made Sakura relax a bit more at least as she curled up on his couch, face buried in her knees but gripping the boys hands with a death grip. \nKakashi made tea while silently watching his team huddle together. They were\u2026they were a team. A good one he realized abruptly. Not just as watching each other\u2019s backs and keeping up in the field or a fight, but in everything. The way Sasuke leaned towards them when they shifted, the way Naruto had a sixth sense for when his teammates were emotionally charged. The way Sakura kept tabs on them everywhere all the time. \nKakashi smiled beneath his mask at the thought and brought four mugs of hot green tea dosed with honey to the kids. Only when they\u2019d all taken big sips did he settle across from them on the coffee table and look at them carefully.\n\u201cNow, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nThe way Sasuke and Naruto looked at Sakura said they weren\u2019t completely sure. Sakura angrily dashed the last of her tears and took a gulp of her tea.\n\u201cNaruto is not allowed to go back to the guy you have teaching him seals,\u201d she said.\nHer tone was firm and angry and booked no room for argument.\n\u201cHas he been trying to convince you to leave Team Seven again?\u201d Kakashi sighed. \nHe had hoped Jiraya would back off. And that Sasuke and Sakura wouldn\u2019t hear about the threat to their team. He should have known that Jiraya was stubborn as a rock and that Naruto told the other two everything.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sakura growled, low and dangerous, \u201cHe\u2019s a pervert!\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Kakashi said slowly, \u201cHe did write Icha Icha.\u201d\n\u201cNot that!\u201d Sakura hissed, \u201cHe\u2019s perving on Naruto!\u201d\nKakashi\u2019s eyes leapt to Naruto who shrugged. Kakashi felt something in him bare it\u2019s teeth; that was not a \u2018I have no idea what\u2019s she\u2019s talking about\u2019 shrug, that was a \u2018so what?\u2019 shrug. \n\u201cExplain,\u201d Kakashi said sharply.\nNaruto shrugged again looking at his feet, confused. Sakura almost surged out of her seat, hand still grasping Naruto\u2019s tightly.\n\u201cHe\u2019s making Naruto use that prank jutsu to look like a girl as they train!\u201d she howled, \u201cSo that he can stare like a pervert!\u201d\nKakashi wanted to believe better of Jiraya, to think it was all innocent, but one look at Naruto\u2019s face said that was true. And that Naruto had no idea that that was wrong. \n\u201cNaruto,\u201d Kakashi said, setting his mug aside, \u201cIs that true?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, yeah?\u201d Naruto said, \u201cHe was gonna brush me off the other day cause I said no to being his apprentice and go spend time peeping so I used my sexy-no-jutsu cause it always works on perverts. He got a nosebleed like jiji but said he gave it two-thumbs up approval and said he would teach me a smoke tag if I did the lessons while in the henge. I kept clothes on so it wasn\u2019t the usual smoke clouds.\u201d\nThe terrible thing was Kakashi could picture Naruto henged as a girl sitting taking lessons as normal not thinking anything was totally wrong with the picture. Even if Jiraya didn\u2019t take it any farther, didn\u2019t even stare at Naruto as he give a lessons; he had still asked it of Naruto.\nKakashi took a deep breath.\n\u201cFinish your tea,\u201d he said quietly.\nThe boys obeyed but Sakura held Kakashi\u2019s gaze. He gave an acknowledging nod and she gave a curt nod of approval before downing her tea. Kakashi tucked his kids into his bed. It was a tight fit being a single bed for three of them, but they were all small things still, not yet hitting their growth spurts. They curled under his shuriken-printed duvet and Kakashi silently summoned the pack. They took one look at the kids nodding off and Kakashi\u2019s stone-cold face and all curled up around the room to guard. \nOnly Pakkun remained at his side as Kakashi got fully dressed and slanted his headband over his eye. He locked the kids in, setting up an extra trap of two to make them feel safer and then set off across the dark city.\n\u201cTrack down Jiraya for me,\u201d Kakashi said, voice dark, \u201cCome find me when you locate him.\u201d\nPakkun put his nose to the ground immediately, the sage\u2019s scent one of the ones he had long since memorized. He didn\u2019t question Kakashi with such a dark set look on his face. \nKakashi set off in a different direction than the pug, lightly hopping from roof to roof as he headed for the center of the village. He kept his chakra carefully regulated and let none of the anger fester in it; he didn\u2019t want to agitate anyone or raise alarm.\nKakashi landed lightly on a doorstep and gently knocked on the door. Windows were for bothering people or for friends, doors were for respect and while Kakashi rarely used the door, this time it was needed. Despite the quiet knock Kakashi heard the faint steps coming for the door. As the door swung open Kakashi held up his hand in a greeting to show that they were empty and he came in peace. \n\u201cHatake,\u201d Umino Iruka said flatly, \u201cIt\u2019s almost 4am. This had better be an emergency.\u201d\nThe man was wearing his yukata half-hazardously, his hair down and mussed, and Kakashi knew he had just awoken him. Reasonable at 4am.\n\u201cCan we talk,\u201d Kakashi said, and his voice was just as flat, a dark edge hidden under politeness.\nUmino\u2019s eyes sharpened on him and he slowly stepped aside letting Kakashi into the entrance. As the door shut Kakashi didn\u2019t bother taking his shoes off. He wouldn\u2019t be here long. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong,\u201d Umino asked, voice pitched low.\nKakashi watched a spark of chakra travel up the seals around the door. Umino\u2019s house was well warded, with security seals embedded in the walls like the Hatake compound. That one, if Kakashi was not mistaken, made sure no listening devices would function, and that no spy equipment nor subtle jutsu would breach the walls. That was important for a man who did sensitive paperwork for the Hokage outside of the office. \n\u201cThere is\u2026 an issue,\u201d Kakashi started, \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to kick the hornets\u2019 nest over it.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you are,\u201d Umino muttered, leaning against the wall and folding his arms, looking entirely unimpressed.\n\u201cAnd I need your support,\u201d Kakashi said. \nUmino\u2019s nose twitched. Like he could smell trouble. Kakashi met his gaze squarely. Umino had a problem with Kakashi over his teaching methods but Kakashi had no issues with Umino. The man was a damn good shinobi and damn good at his job. Titles like chunin meant nothing in the scheme of things, only raw power levels (and any medic could tell you power was nothing, control was the point). \n\u201cIt\u2019s about Naruto,\u201d Kakashi said, bluntly.\nUmino narrowed his eyes. It was a look that said \u2018I know you\u2019re trying to manipulate me\u2019 but it was also a look that said he didn\u2019t care.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been sending Naruto to Jiraya for sealing lessons,\u201d Kakashi explained, \u201cAnd just sealing lessons. I told him no lessons on harnessing the Kyuubi.\u201d\nUmino let out a hiss at the mention of the bijuu but for once looked like he approved of what Kakashi was saying.\n\u201cJiraya threatened to go over my head to the Hokage,\u201d Kakashi further explained.\nAnd Umino snorted, waving a hand in a dismissive way. He was thinking the same thing Kakashi had at least. Kakashi had been given Team seven for a reason, and being one of the Hokage\u2019s favorites gave one a lot of leeway. Even though Jiraya was one of the Sandaime\u2019s students, Kakashi and Naruto were favored as well and the Hokage was unlikely to take sides. He was more than likely to straight up give Naruto the choice. \n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that,\u201d Kakashi agreed, \u201cBut things have changed. I\u2019m going to separate Naruto from Jiraya fully. No more sealing, no more lessons of any sort. And that\u2019s going to make Jiraya irritated.\u201d\nUmino frowned, eyeing Kakashi. Since Naruto had been allowed sealing lessons, the Hokage was unlikely to step in, seeing as Naruto would be getting lessons from Jiraya and time with the man while still being Kakashi\u2019s student. But not letting Jiraya near the boy at all was going to make Jiraya throw a fit and that would grab the Hokage\u2019s attention.\n\u201cI need you to back me up,\u201d Kakashi said pointedly.\nUmino\u2019s word would hold weight, especially if it was to agree with Kakashi. They were often on the opposite sides in their politics so Umino actually agreeing with him would hold be a shock. A shock that would make the Hokage mull it over instead of making a flash decision, in civilian terms, of split-custody. \n\u201cWhy?\u201d Umino asked carefully.\nHe was getting a bit twitchy. Kakashi meeting him at 4am was odd. Kakashi asking for his help was a sign of alarm to the man. Kakashi asking him to go to the Hokage with that help was a disaster. At least that must be what Umino was thinking.\n\u201cJiraya made Naruto stay in his sexy-no-jutsu for his last few sealing lessons,\u201d Kakashi said bluntly.\nUmino gave a full body twitch, something like a snarl slipping from his lips.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what you think of my teaching methods,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cBut I care for my students. I want them to grow up into healthy adults. I want them to have what freedom and innocence they can have even as shinobi. Naruto didn\u2019t even realize what was wrong with it. Sakura was the one who came to me in tears, worried about her teammate.\u201d\nUmino had a dark look in his eyes, but he was still listening. \n\u201cSo Jiraya is done. No more time with Naruto alone. I don\u2019t care if he didn\u2019t mean it, if it was a joke that went too far. But he\u2019s not going to take that laying down. Maybe he will defend himself, maybe he will simply apologize, but he\u2019s not allowed alone with Naruto anymore.\u201d\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d Umino said lowly, \u201cI have your back in this. Wait here.\u201d\nKakashi waited in the entrance as Umino vanished back into the house. He returned a few minutes later, fully dressed and looking like he hadn\u2019t just rolled out of bed. \n\u201cI take it you\u2019re going to talk to Jiraya right now?\u201d\n\u201cI was going to. I have Pakkun tracking him down.\u201d\n\u201cHmm. Stick with me for a bit.\u201d\nKakashi followed the chunin out of his home, watching him seal the house behind him, and then make a beeline for the neighbors. Genma was already leaning against his doorframe, watching them with careful eyes, dressed in lounging clothes. Kakashi could see Umino\u2019s other neighbor leaning out the window, watching carefully. Kakashi gave Tenzo a salute and the man nodded but stayed watching.\nUmino was an unassuming man to any outsider or civilian, but to the shinobi of Konoha (at least the higher-ranked ones), Umino was a man of power. He had the Hokage\u2019s favor, did much of his paperwork, and was a trusted advisor. That meant, despite his apparent ranking, Umino was a well-guarded figure of Konoha. He lived in the heart of Konoha, in the safest place, and had ANBU living on either side of him, the houses made into ANBU housing. There was never not at least one ANBU somewhere in his vicinity. He was too valuable. \n\u201cGenma,\u201d Umino greeted, \u201cAre you free today?\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d Genma smiled, senbon rolling across his mouth, \u201cYou need a hand?\u201d\n\u201cKakashi needs someone to help with his students for the day,\u201d Umino smiled.\n\u201cI could spare the day,\u201d Genma agreed, \u201cWhen do they meet?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re at my apartment,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cI\u2019ll send a ninken along with word of your coming but if you could stay out of the apartment before they wake that would be a good idea. Sakura usually goes with Gai in the morning, but perhaps you can keep her for the day.\u201d\nKakashi pulled out a personal exploding tag and wrote a message on the back. Naruto would recognize his handy work for the seal and not question the legitimacy of the note. Kakashi also fished out his wallet and forked over some cash that Genma took, mouth slowly opening in surprise.\n\u201cBreakfast and lunch are my treat,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cWe usually do breakfast at 8am.\u201d\nGenma sort of gaped at him. Well, Kakashi was well known for skipping out on the bill. \n\u201cThey all need to do some taijutsu exercises, but I\u2019ll leave the rest of the day up to you,\u201d Kakashi said. \nGenma nodded slowly, looking between them.\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye on them,\u201d Genma said carefully, \u201cGood luck with whatever you\u2019re doing.\u201d\nGenma slipped into his house, probably to change and Kakashi waved at Umino to pause as Pakkun slipped from the shadows. \n\u201cFound him boss. He\u2019s at the usual house. Sleeping.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Kakashi said leaning over to give him a scratch, \u201cWould you find Gai, and let him know that Sakura won\u2019t be joining him this morning; Genma\u2019s watching my team for the day. Then if you could let the kids know Genma is coming\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou got it, boss,\u201d Pakkun nodded, \u201cYou be careful okay? Just summon us if you need us.\u201d\n\u201cNo. You watch the kids,\u201d Kakashi shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m not expecting any danger to them, but I want them uninvolved in all this.\u201d\nThe ninken nodded and was off in a flash towards Gai\u2019s house. Gai would be waking soon anyways. Umino was watching silently and only spoke up when the dog was gone.\n\u201cYou care for them. All of them,\u201d he noted.\n\u201cI do,\u201d Kakashi said in a tone of voice that left no room for argument.\nUmino searched his face for a long moment and then nodded sharply, something like a smile curling his mouth. Seems they were good for now.\n.--.\n\u201cYo,\u201d Kakashi smiled, appearing in a swirl of leaves.\n\u201cKakashi-sensei!\u201d Naruto beamed, throwing himself at him. Kakashi caught the kid, spinning with the hug and quickly found Sakura joining, grabbing him around the waist in a hug. Sasuke didn\u2019t join the hug but hovered close enough to be touching until Kakashi reached out and ruffled his hair.\n\u201cWhere were you? Genma-sensei said you were busy, so he was teaching us today! And Pakkun-sensei said he worked with the Yondaime! He taught us how the Yondaime used seals to appear in a flash! Like, halfway across the country!\u201d Naruto babbled. \n\u201cHe said I wasn\u2019t to train with Gai-sensei this morning,\u201d Sakura said a lot more quietly just for their ears, \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t let us out of his sight.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s also someone watching,\u201d Sasuke said even quieter.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the masked guys,\u201d Naruto added in a louder whisper.\n\u201cGood observations,\u201d Kakashi smiled at all of them, \u201cYes, I was busy so Genma volunteered to help out. I see Gai came to you anyways despite not getting to help you this morning.\u201d\nKakashi looked over their heads and waved at Gai who beamed at him from where he was guiding Tenten through a kata while Neji and Lee spared lightly on the river. Genma was watching from his seat on a log, spinning a senbon through his fingers and not looking at all upset by the fact his kids had ditched him the second Kakashi appeared. \n\u201cHe came to train with us,\u201d Sakura said, \u201cWe did some taijutsu sparing this morning, and then they\u2019ve just been sharing the training ground. Naruto keeps muttering about Neji spying on him but I think Gai-sensei was worried.\u201d\nKakashi smiled faintly and gave Gai a quick warm look.\n\u201cDid you enjoy Genma\u2019s training?\u201d Kakashi asked.\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Naruto beamed, \u201cHe knows some awesome seals!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s really good with senbon,\u201d Sakura said, \u201cLike as good as Haku was, probably even better.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026he worked with Uchiha,\u201d Sasuke said, \u201cHe knows some of our kata.\u201d\n\u201cGenma is a good shinobi,\u201d Kakashi agreed.\nThat was an underwhelming statement when talking about Shiranui Genma. The man who had been Gai\u2019s genin teammate and who had been in ANBU as long as Kakashi, even longer at this point it most likely, and who had worked exclusively with the Yondaime as a guard was a masterful Shinobi. The only reason his name wasn\u2019t as widespread or as feared as Kakashi\u2019s was because he worked in the shadows. He\u2019d never needed to be a showy threat and instead excelled as an assassin and guard who stayed in the shadows.\n\u201cHow about you three do some cooldown exercises,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cThen we can go get dinner. BBQ sound good?\u201d\nThey all brightened.\n\u201cGo tell Gai he and his team are invited as well,\u201d Kakashi added.\nSakura ran off to tell them as Naruto and Sasuke dropped into stretches, lightly squabbling as Naruto kicked at Sasuke\u2019s ankle on accident. Gai\u2019s students joined them in some cool down exercises as Gai and Genma joined Kakashi just out of hearing range of the kids.\n\u201cEverything sorted?\u201d Genma asked lightly.\n\u201cFor now,\u201d Kakashi sighed, \u201cThere was\u2026a disagreement about how much training Jiraya would be giving Naruto.\u201d\nThat was saying it lightly. Jiraya had predictably thrown a shit fit when Kakashi said he wasn\u2019t to see Naruto anymore. Kakashi, Umino, Jiraya, and the Hokage had spent most of the morning and afternoon locked in his office trapped in arguments. Having Umino at his back had been a master play and the Hokage had been quite reasonable even with all his favorites squabbling like children. Kakashi was not ashamed to say he had been driven to snarling a few times, yelling even once or twice. He cared about Team Seven and he was not ashamed to show it. They would always have him at their back. \nDespite the fact Kakashi wanted Jiraya far away from his kids he had not gotten it. Jiraya was too important and had too many ties to Naruto for him to just disappear. Kakashi had gotten the Hokage to agree he would not be allowed to teach Naruto alone though. Not just because of the perving, but because of how much claim Kakashi had as well. The fact that Naruto was happy where he was, was also a huge boon and if that ever changed Kakashi knew he would be under review as a sensei. \n\u201cIf Naruto needs any sealing lessons,\u201d Genma said, \u201cI am not the level of Jiraya, but I hold my own.\u201d\nKakashi glanced at the man and found the offer genuine.\n\u201cThat would be helpful,\u201d Kakashi nodded, \u201cIf you\u2019re up to it. Jiraya will be helping Naruto with sealing a few days a week, but if you could join them\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d be happy too. I\u2019ll take him the few days Jiraya doesn\u2019t as well. He\u2019s a quick kid,\u201d Genma nodded, \u201cI also have a few tips for him with that sickle and chain he likes. I can\u2019t do every day, but the majority should be good. He said you guys have different plans on the weekend so that works as well.\u201d\nKakashi released a breath and gave Genma a grateful nod. \n\u201cIf Jiraya is agreeable, Tenten would like more lessons on sealing as well,\u201d Gai said, at a reasonable level for once, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind as well Genma, Tenten could tag along.\u201d\nAs another pair of eyes went unsaid.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with it. Even if Jiraya doesn\u2019t want to teach her I can keep her busy,\u201d Genma nodded. \n\u201cWonderful! I\u2019ll fill her in!\u201d Gai beamed.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Kakashi told his eternal rival. \nSome of the tension of the day bled off of him. So many people helping out, taking his side was\u2026it was inspiring to be honest. Kakashi hadn\u2019t always been the best with retaining bonds with other shinobi. Most of the bonds were built on respect and the fact Kakashi was a powerful and unquestionably loyal shinobi. To see that those bonds weren\u2019t just superficial respects paid to a higher-ranking Shinobi was gratifying.\n(Unknown to Kakashi was the fact that taking a team had changed many people\u2019s opinions of him. Despite the fact Team Seven wasn\u2019t often out and about in the public eye many people had heard of the fact that Hatake Kakashi was dedicating his every waking moment and all his resources into this team. And equally, not favoring the last Uchiha or the Kyuubi Jinchuriki over the civilian-born girl. How people treated kids and students spoke a lot about them, and people who had thought Kakashi would be a garbage teacher were looking at him in a new light. Kakashi was proving himself over and over every day he had this team, that he was still powerful, loyal, and most of all, caring of the shinobi of this village). \n\u201cWe\u2019re done sensei!\u201d Naruto yelled.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go get some food then,\u201d Kakashi smiled. \n.--.\n\u201cOkay kids, serious talk time,\u201d Kakashi said.\nHis students, taking that as a sign for a break, collapsed at his feet. They all rolled in the grass to peer up at him and Kakashi felt something sad in him as he realized he was giving this talk to a bunch of kids. At the same time, there was no better time to educate them. \n\u201cNow, you remember the talk we have the first week in the forest about Sex?\u201d\nAll the kids blushed, looking anywhere but each other and he chuckled. His cute little students had been so red they had nearly passed out when he gave them the sex talk. He had covered more than the academy would going into dangers and diseases and problems. But he had also went into attraction and flings and how sex was OK. It was okay to want it, to seek it out, you just had to be careful. There were too many conservatives and oldies on the education board and as such the academy had only given basic safety talks, about all the technicalities of sex and the dangers of rape. His kids had never heard anyone tell them that sex was okay, that it was natural, that they just had to be Safe first and foremost. \nIt had embarrassed them all enough that even Sakura had stopped making eyes at Sasuke. Not that she had been doing that often from simply lack of energy seeing as he ran them into the ground. The fact that they were getting closer and closer as a team had also made Sakura realize that she wasn\u2019t in love with Sasuke. Not yet at least. She\u2019d had a kiddy crush on him and a smart girl like Sakura knew not to let that get in the way of teamwork or training. Maybe she still harbored that crush, maybe she didn\u2019t, but it didn\u2019t come up anymore. \n\u201cPlease, not again,\u201d Naruto moaned.\n\u201cI only gave you half the talk last time,\u201d Kakashi clicked his tongue, \u201cand now that we\u2019re back amongst real people we need to finish it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat more could there even be,\u201d Sakura tried desperately. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about consent,\u201d Kakashi said seriously.\nThey peered at him warily. Sakura looked a little more interested, darting a glance at Naruto.\n\u201cNaruto, if a girl tells you No when you ask her out on a date what do you do?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026try again later?\u201d he said, \u201cI mean, not that day, but maybe another day when she\u2019s in a better mood.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kakashi said firmly, \u201cYou leave her alone. She gave her answer.\u201d\nThe kids stared at him, all shocked in their own way.\n\u201cBut my mum says you have to keep trying, to show that you really do like them,\u201d Sakura said meekly.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kakashi said sharply, \u201cWhat you are doing after that No is called harassment. How did you feel every time you turned Naruto down and he came back?\u201d\n\u201cAnnoyed,\u201d she said softly as she looked at the ground.\n\u201cAnd you Sasuke? Every time Sakura kept hanging off you even though you turned her down.\u201d\n\u201cAnnoyed,\u201d Sasuke repeated, none of his usually sharpness in his voice. \nAll his kids were looking at the ground.\n\u201cAs kids it\u2019s a bit more forgivable, you don\u2019t know how you are supposed to act,\u201d he said, \u201cBut you are all genin now, adults in the eyes of the law. Sakura, if a stranger came up to you and asked you out and you said No very politely but he kept showing up and asking, would you feel good? Would you feel like he was just being determined, just trying to prove his love? Or would you feel afraid?\u201d\nShe swallowed, looking at her feet. \n\u201cNaruto, if you had girls following you every day, fighting over who got sat next to you, trying to follow you home or drag you to a date, would you feel happy?\u201d\nNaruto considered it. Kakashi could see the way he mulled the question, saw the way his eyes darted to Sasuke and imagined the girls who had done that to him.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly.\n\u201cSasuke, would you feel respected if a girl who said she loved you would not leave you alone? If you told her no and she just ignored you and asked again and again and again?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sasuke said sharply, almost angrily.\n\u201cYou are allowed to ask people out, you are allowed to ask them to kiss you, to hold hands with them, hell you can even hit on them for sex as long as you are polite, but if they say No, they mean it. No means No.\u201d\nHis kids all nodded, peering up at him as if to see if he was disappointed or angry.\n\u201cI want you to understand that now,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cYou must respect other people\u2019s choices, and your own. Your choice and your body belong to you. No one has a right to it but you. You can sleep with whoever you like and say no to whoever you like. It is your decision and requires no defense, no explanation. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s strangers, friends, teachers; you have a right to say No. Do you understand?\u201d\nHis kids thought it over and he was proud of them for actually thinking about it and not immediately giving an answer he wanted to hear.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Naruto said first, \u201cNo means no, and I\u2019m allowed to say no.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sakura said in a small voice, \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry Sasuke.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026It\u2019s okay,\u201d Sasuke said lowly.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry too,\u201d Naruto said looking miserable as he looked at Sakura\u2019s feet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said with a weak smile. \n\u201cGood,\u201d Kakashi said leaning over to ruffle hair, \u201cYou know if you have any questions you come to me. And if you have anyone disrespect your \u2018No\u2019 you come straight to me as well.\u201d\nThey all nodded and Kakashi smiled warmly before he got them running laps. They were silent as they obeyed and he was glad to see they were mulling over his talk. Ninja weren\u2019t often talked to straight about consent and there were moments in their career they would be ordered to do things they wanted to say No to but couldn\u2019t. But he was going to make sure that outside of their missions, outside of being soldiers, they would damn well be responsible and happy. \n.--.\n\u201cHow were the lessons?\u201d Kakashi asked even as he didn\u2019t take his eyes off the scroll in front of him.\nIt was a scroll on advanced chakra theory. He\u2019d read it before but had thought back on it recently and went back to it. Sakura had asked him some questions about it and while he had answered well he had forgotten some of it. \nSakura and Sasuke, groaned in unison and sat at his feet, scrolls spilling from their arms. \n\u201cThey fast-tracked us,\u201d Sakura grumbled. \n\u201cOh?\u201d Kakashi hummed. \n\u201cSaid we knew enough herb lore and first aid from your lessons we didn\u2019t need basic training,\u201d Sakura said giving him a narrow-eyed look over his scroll.\nHe hid his smirk, well aware this was most likely to happen. While Sakura was more interested in herbs and poisons, Sasuke had kept a half ear on the lessons as well. As well as the fact Sakura liked to talk about what she learned, mimicking Kakashi in that every moment was a learning moment. Naruto liked gardening as a hobby but couldn\u2019t keep up with the two and shrugged the babble off to focus on his own thing. Which is why he was off doing other stuff while they did first-aid lessons. They would all overlap in certain areas, sharing lessons, and in others they\u2019d diverge to fill gaps in their collective knowledge. Well-rounded, is what Kakashi called it.\n\u201cSo fast tracked up to more intense first-aid?\u201d Kakashi asked.\n\u201cInto medical jutsu,\u201d Sakura corrected.\n\u201cOh ho?\u201d Kakashi said, finally lowering his scroll. \n\u201cBut it takes so much reading and exercise before we can even use it on people,\u201d Sakura groaned.\n\u201cIf they think you have the control though, that\u2019s a high compliment,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cAre you interested in specializing in medic jutsu?\u201d\nSakura shook her head immediately.\n\u201cI mean,\u201d she explained, \u201cI could probably be good at it, but I just want enough for field injuries. I want to focus on taijutsu and my hammer.\u201d\nSasuke stayed silent though and Kakashi turned to him.\n\u201cHow about you Sasuke?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d the boy hesitated.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to decide right away,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cBut it\u2019s an option if you\u2019re interested.\u201d\n\u201cThey said Sakura had better control,\u201d Sasuke said.\n\u201cThat just means you have to put more practice in, not that you can\u2019t do it, idiot,\u201d Sakura huffed, \u201cKakashi-sensei, he was more interested in the lesson then I was.\u201d\n\u201cMah, well, let me know if you want to continue after this course,\u201d Kakashi smiled.\nMedic jutsu would be a good direction for Sasuke. He was a good ninja all around and could go into any specialization, but maybe for his health and psych being a medic would be good for him. Kakashi would keep an eye on that.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Naruto by the way?\u201d Sakura asked. \nAt just that moment an explosion of purples smoke burst out of the trees to the left.\n\u201cHe\u2019s working on his traps and sabotage,\u201d Kakashi smiled.\nSakura and Sasuke looked into the trees interested but turned to their scrolls as nothing else went off. The three of them had a peaceful hour of reading before Naruto came stumbling into the clearing trailing smoke and ash, his clothes torn and splattered with ink and paint. He had a wide beaming grin on his face despite the disaster though.\n\u201cThat was awesome! Iruka-sensei, why didn\u2019t you tell me you were so good with traps!\u201d\nUmino followed the boy from the trees, only a faint smudge of orange paint on his vest.\n\u201cYou never asked,\u201d he teased Naruto. \nIt had barely taken a few words past Naruto\u2019s name to get Umino to give up half a day on the weekend to teach Naruto some finer points of sabotage and traps. \n\u201cIruka-sensei!\u201d Sakura perked up waving.\nEven Sasuke offered him a nod.\n\u201cHello,\u201d Umino smiled, eyes crinkling warmly, \u201cHow are you two? I heard you both enrolled in a first-aid program at the hospital.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sakura grinned, \u201cThey even bumped us up a level!\u201d\nWhen telling Kakashi she had sounded a tad disgruntled, but proud. With Umino she sounded a tad proud, but unsure. Kakashi reached out and ruffled her hair and she beamed at him. He was glad they understood he was proud of them, always. \n\u201cGood job!\u201d Umino praised. \nHe took a seat next to Naruto on the ground beside the other two and Kakashi dragged the bag of drinks forward. Naruto eagerly lunged for a juice box while Umino dipped his head in thanks, grabbing a water bottle. With the summer heat approaching and all the training they were doing, Kakashi was keeping their snack and drink bag well stocked. Sometimes he felt like a parent keeping his children well fed for a sports meeting. \n\u201cWhat are the plans for the rest of the day?\u201d Umino asked off-handedly. \n\u201cReading,\u201d Naruto groaned.\n\u201cWe do scroll work on Saturday nights, which I think is fun\u201d Sakura stuck her tongue out at Naruto.\n\u201cOh?\u201d Umino said casually.\n\u201cWe do research,\u201d Sakura explained, \u201cOn things we had questions on, or on anything Kakashi thinks might be useful. After the Wave mission we did some research into Wave and Kiri politics. Before the chunin exam we did research into the ranking system and exams or every country. Which should have told us what was coming.\u201d\nShe shot Kakashi a look and he gave her a sly grin. \n\u201cThis week we\u2019re doing chakra theory,\u201d Sakura perked up, \u201cAnd how nature chakra and ying and yang chakra interact.\u201d\n\u201cTraining the mind, not just the body,\u201d Umino smiled approvingly, \u201cAnd what about tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cSunday is rest day,\u201d Naruto grinned, \u201cCause you have to let your muscles recover Sakura says! We get to sleep in!\u201d\n\u201cWe also do non-shinobi stuff,\u201d Sakura grinned, \u201cI\u2019m getting more shamisen lessons!\u201d\n\u201cWe do gotta clean the house though,\u201d Naruto grumbled.\n\u201cI heard you moved out of your apartment,\u201d Umino said, like he wasn\u2019t digging for information, \u201cIs it the place the Hokage and I visited last week?\u201d\nKakashi was aware all of his students were very aware of what Umino was doing even if he was obvious about it and he was proud. \n\u201cYeah, we all like at Kakashi\u2019s house!\u201d Naruto grinned, \u201cIt always has hot water! And a yard! Sasuke even brought Koi.\u201d\n\u201cThat was nice of you Sasuke,\u201d Umino smiled at the broody boy who gave him an oddly shy look.\nBut over the kid\u2019s head he sent Kakashi a narrow-eyed glare. Kakashi held his hands up in mock surrender.\n\u201cThe Hatake compound was sitting empty,\u201d Kakashi explained casually, \u201cAnd the kids like the extra space. I personally like the cozy shinobi apartments, where I still live, but they like the manor.\u201d\nUmino sighed and relaxed as he realized he had had the wrong idea and he really had done it out of kindness. Kakashi could see Umino wasn\u2019t truly suspicious of him either, he\u2019d just been digging. Since the night a few days ago, it was like a switch had been thrown and Umino was giving him less narrow-eyed disapproving looks. Seems he\u2019d finally won the man to his side, or at least to neutral territory. \n\u201cYou should join us for dinner tomorrow,\u201d Kakashi decided abruptly. \n\u201cYeah!\u201d Naruto agreed enthusiastically, \u201cCome for dinner Iruka-sensei!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to impose on your day off,\u201d Umino smiled, ruffling Naruto\u2019s hair.\nThe blond flushed happily at the touch and Kakashi was reminded that Umino was one of his precious people. One he hadn\u2019t seen much since joining Team Seven.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cNaruto\u2019s cooking tomorrow so it might be Ramen though.\u201d\nUmino laughed, bright and loud and started to tease Naruto who puffed up and claimed he had asked Teuichi the ramen chef for a recipe and he was going to master it. Kakashi let the two chit-chat, letting Naruto get away with not doing some reading right away, and turned as Sakura tugged on his sleeve, a scroll in her hand.\n.--.\nKakashi breathed once deeply as he came out of meditation, holding the breath in his lungs until it burned and releasing it. Across from him, Sasuke did the same. The water beneath them rippled with the curious koi but neither of them twitched.\n\u201cHow is the mark feeling?\u201d Kakashi asked.\nSasuke frowned and absently shifted the shoulder with the curse mark.\n\u201cWhen I use too much chakra, or use it too suddenly it\u2026jolts,\u201d Sasuke said quietly, \u201cBut I ignore it.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cAnd what do you think of the lessons this past week?\u201d\nSasuke was silent for a moment. In the silence they could hear Naruto humming as he banged around the house, wandering room to room to water the plants that had started popping up everywhere, half his own house plants and half Sakura\u2019s herbs and medicinal plants. Even Sasuke had snuck a few in the house. Sakura was off having lunch with her parents.\n\u201cI\u2026the genjutsu lessons have been\u2026useful. Yugao-sensei is skilled,\u201d Sasuke finally said, \u201cI think Sakura grasps them quicker.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Yugao-sensei said she is more creative,\u201d Sasuke grumbled.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re just as good,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cBut probably more offensively orientated. Sakura is probably better at the details, right?\u201d\nSasuke blinked, nodding.\n\u201cWhen you fight and train Sasuke, you are very focused. You\u2019ve seen a lot of death. You\u2019ve seen a lot of consequences of not being strong enough,\u201d Kakashi said calmly, \u201cAnd so you are prepared for it, you anticipate it and fight it. You get focused on that and so I suspect you genjutsu mirror that and are much more to the point and offensive. Sakura is a calmer kid, she probably likes to focus on details, on surprises in her genjutsu and subtle things. She probably likes to make people doubt they were even fighting while you constantly remind whoever is caught in your genjutsu that they are indeed in a battle.\u201d\nSasuke stared at him but did not refute it and Kakashi gave him a smile.\n\u201cYou are just as good Sasuke, you just have different styles.\u201d\nTension slipped out of his shoulders. For a boy who was top of his year and who had long been praised as a genius, he doubted himself when other seemed to do just as well or better than him. Sometimes he just needed reassurance that he was doing fine. \n\u201cIt\u2019s like ninjutsu,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cTake the Water Bullet jutsu, Naruto makes stronger and larger ones than you, but you master them more quickly and are more versatile in their use. Differences in style.\u201d\nSasuke looked at him as if to see if he was truthful and then finally gave a small nod, mouth relaxing into something close to a smile.\n\u201cNow, I think we need some groceries. Should we go get Naruto and go do the shopping?\u201d\nSasuke nodded and stood, the water barely rippling under his feet as they stepped off the pond.\n\u201cGroceries?\u201d Naruto asked seeing them enter the house.\n\u201cYeah. Go grab the bags,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cAnd maybe brush your hair so it doesn\u2019t look like a rat\u2019s nest.\u201d\nNaruto squawked a defense of his hair but obeyed. Sasuke wandered off to find his wallet and Kakashi debated grabbing his vest. In the end they wandered out of the manor in casual wear, Sasuke and Naruto in shorts and plain t-shirts and Kakashi in plain blue slacks and shirt. They still had yet to replace their uniforms and well, with the heat and casual training they had stuck to the civilian clothes, uncaring of their durability. Plus, it seemed to make them feel more like kids, Naruto kicking at rocks in his flip flops. Most shinobi felt naked without their armor and uniform after a while, but Kakashi wanted his kids to be able to blend in with any populace, even their own and not feel uncomfortable. They weren\u2019t just ninja but kids and they needed to feel normal every once in a while. \nSo they wandered off to the market, Kakashi following behind and shooting down only the ridiculous ideas, like Naruto buying the biggest tub of ice-cream they had, which wouldn\u2019t fit in the freezer. \nThey wandered past the Haruno house-hold after a bit and Sakura came out to meet them in a yellow sundress. She took Naruto\u2019s hand when he offered it and the kids set off chit chatting as they gathered groceries and supplies. They paid a visit to the quartermaster to stock up on kunai and shuriken while Kakashi put an order in for Naruto for more ninja wire and sabotage tools, as well as sealing supplies. \nSasuke was the one to mention the ninken and they headed to the butcher for bones under Kakashi\u2019s beaming smile. Finally they stopped at the convenience store on the corner for drinks and ice-cream. Kakashi carried the bulk of the bags as Naruto challenge the other two to a race. He merely laughed at them when they all nearly hit a wall dodging some civilians leading a cart down the side road. \nKakashi could get used to these lazy days watching them act like kids as they hollered and tussled and ran. \n\u201cKakashi!\u201d\nKakashi glanced up to find Kurenai and Asuma stepping out of a tea shop, Asuma waving at him. Up ahead he heard Naruto yelp as Sasuke tripped him. \n\u201cYo,\u201d Kakashi smiled, hands full of bags. \n\u201cShopping?\u201d Asuma asked as he tugged a cigarette free of a pocket. \nKakashi watched in amusement as Kurenai yanked the cigarette out of his mouth without even looking at the man.\n\u201cJust helping the kids stock up on groceries,\u201d Kakashi nodded. \n\u201cSpeaking of the kids,\u201d Asuma said, \u201cI was hoping you guys had an afternoon free coming up. We could do some team exercises.\u201d\nKakashi raised a brow at the two.\n\u201cSince neither of our teams made it to the final we thought there would be no pressure of revealing any tricks,\u201d Asuma said, \u201cAnd it would be good to have this generation interact more.\u201d\nAsuma gave him a pointed look and Kakashi remembered the grim and wary looks Team Ten had given Team Seven after the Forest of Death. Perhaps it would be good for them to do some team exercises. \n\u201cWe should have an afternoon free,\u201d Kakashi agreed, \u201cWill your team be joining in Kurenai?\u201d\nShe scrutinized him a long moment and then gave a nod.\n\u201cIt will be good for them. They\u2019re all too used to sparing with their families or each other. It didn\u2019t help them in the exams.\u201d\n\u201cFair,\u201d Kakashi agreed knowing that problem, \u201cHow about Friday? A bit of a ways out but that\u2019s the only day we don\u2019t have anyone else joining our training.\u201d\n\u201cAh yeah, I heard you\u2019ve been getting some other jonin to come give them some lessons,\u201d Asuma said, \u201cAnd getting others to not help.\u201d\nKakashi raised a brow at him knowing everyone Jonin and above at least must have heard about the argument with Jiraya. Maybe not all the details, but the fact that Jiraya suddenly wasn\u2019t teaching Naruto privately had been juicy gossip. \n\u201cCircumstances and all that,\u201d Kakashi shrugged.\nKurenai gave him another look, as if trying to read him. She was a rather new jonin and he hadn\u2019t interacted with her much outside of Asuma but she seemed to respect him well enough. \n\u201cYugao told me your student Sakura is doing well in genjutsu,\u201d Kurenai said, \u201cIs she specializing?\u201d\n\u201cYet to be seen,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cThe kids are all still deciding what they like best.\u201d\nThe two raised brows at him. He had said \u2018like\u2019 best, not \u2018were good at\u2019. That was a bit of bragging on Kakashi\u2019s part considering he was declaring them good at pretty much everything, but whatever. \n\u201cKakashi-sensei! The ice-cream is melting!\u201d Naruto yelled as the kids rounded the corner looking a tad more dusty from their race. \n\u201cComing,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cSee you Friday then, Asuma, Kurenai.\u201d\nThey nodded and Kakashi slipped off after his students.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening Friday?\u201d Sakura asked.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d Kakashi sang.\nShe pouted at him but didn\u2019t pry and was distracted as Naruto tripped Sasuke right in her way. Kakashi silently laughed as they started to squabble, Naruto and Sasuke glaring at each other. It was good to see some things, like rivalry, didn\u2019t change.\n.--.\nKakashi slipped his blade back in the sheath strapped to his back and rolled his shoulders, feeling the sweat beading against his spine. \n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten quicker,\u201d Hayate coughed lightly, chest heaving with both exertion and his illness.\n\u201cIn a week?\u201d Kakashi raised a brow.\n\u201cNo, since you took your team. You haven\u2019t been slouching off,\u201d Hayate grinned.\nKakashi gave him an eye-smile and didn\u2019t bother to answer that. Of course he hadn\u2019t been slacking off. In fact, he had been working harder than he had in the past few years. Training kids took a lot of energy, mental, emotional, and physical. He was not only training them but keeping up with all three of them and staying one step ahead. He had been using clones in the forests and wave constantly, stretching his chakra to give each kid the one-on-one time they had desperately needed. \nKakashi had been exercising muscle and jutsu he hadn\u2019t used since ANBU. He had stretched his awareness further out, encasing the kids, and making sure he was aware of them at all times. On top of making lessons plans for physical and mental activities that they had been doing every day. Plus all the emotional baggage that came with three little shinobi-in-training. \nKakashi was in better shape than he had been in years, right up there with his peak in ANBU. Of course he seemed faster to Hayate who rarely worked with him and had only seen him after his ANBU years. \n\u201cThe kids look like they\u2019re almost done,\u201d Hayate coughed, glancing to his girlfriend who was hiding up a tree. \nKakashi sought out Sakura and Sasuke and found them both walking in circles, eyes glazed and smirked. When the genjutsu whispered across his own mind he let the illusion take but remained aware that it was indeed and illusion. Dark loamy earth rose around him, like maze walls, thick greenery growing everywhere across the dirt and up over the ridges. The air felt considerably more damp and in the distance there was the growl and cry of some wild animal. The sky was dark as pitch, a large moon the only light.\nA sense of dread slipped into Kakashi.\nHe dismissed the illusion on himself easily, quick as breathing as his sharingan spun even beneath his headband.\nAnother followed, slipping into his veins and he didn\u2019t even let it reach his senses before he dismissed it. Again, layering itself like a blanket over him. He didn\u2019t bother tilting his headband just cut through it by disturbing his chakra. Yugao glanced at him from the tree, her illusion on the kids unwavering even as she threw genjutsu at him was easy as breathing. This was why Yugao was in ANBU. She pared her genjutsu with kenjutsu to be a terrifying force. She wasn\u2019t quite as skilled as Kurenai at genjutsu, but the fact she made them so effortlessly was what made her so strong with them. \nShe tried one last time, twisting layers of genjutsu around him and the world went fuzzy for a long moment, his mind slipping, and then he cut through them. Yugao let the genjutsu slip away from his students at the same time and Sakura and Sasuke both blinked against the sudden change.\nSakura gave a shout of frustration and kicked at the ground as Yugao slipped from the tree. \n\u201cI still didn\u2019t feel it!\u201d she said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell when you layered it!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I knew something was wrong,\u201d Sasuke muttered, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t gain enough of my senses to know it was an illusion.\u201d\nThat was the trap of genjutsu of course. If done properly, if layered right, people wouldn\u2019t realize they had been caught in a genjutsu even if it was radically different than reality. Simple, but strong genjutsu would merge with reality and make it seem like things had changed just enough to throw you off (like showing you images of your immediate death or of showing everything a foot to the right); these could be harder to notice immediately but most people could break them. \nProfessional, complicated and strong, genjutsu made you question your own mind. They warped reality but made it seem so normal you didn\u2019t question it, just yourself. Kurenai\u2019s signature move was merging with trees, almost seeming inhuman as she changed into trees that strangled and choked. Despite changing into a tree, a person wouldn\u2019t immediately understand they were under her genjutsu, instead they would simply be driven to fear, would accept the non-reality and react. \n\u201cGenjustu is a tricky area,\u201d Yugao said calmly at their frustration, \u201cIn that it tricks not only your senses but your mind. You must become aware of yourself. Before you can master genjutsu you must know yourself and your reality intimately, with no doubt.\u201d\nKakashi could see his students mulling over it, each looking at their own reasons why that was hard.\n\u201cI suggest more meditations,\u201d Yugao said in the silence, \u201cSince I cannot join you for lessons tomorrow, take the time to think on what I said.\u201d\nThe kids nodded and Yugao slipped quietly over to Hayate\u2019s side. They all watched the two wander off out of the training ground.\n\u201cAre they dating?\u201d Sakura asked, glancing after the two.\n\u201cYup,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cThough there are some bets on when they\u2019re getting married. I personally have money down that they are already married, from some old mission where they eloped.\u201d\nSakura grinned at him, something like romance in her eyes at the thought. Sakura was a practical girl but she also had dreams and fantasies of how the world should be. Kakashi let her keep her dreams.\n\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d \nThey turned to find Naruto tromping through the bush to fall into the training ground, Bisuke quick on his heels.\nThe dog gave Kakashi a nod and vanished in a plume of smoke, having completed his job of keeping an eye on Naruto. Tenten followed Naruto a moment later, picking her steps more carefully since she had a large scroll tied to her back. \n\u201cHow were the lessons?\u201d Kakashi smiled.\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d Naruto pumped his hands in the air, \u201cGenma-sensei showed me how to make exploding tags while Jiraya and Tenten argued!\u201d\n\u201cArgued?\u201d Kakashi raised a brow at the bunned girl.\n\u201cHe was trying to tell me my sealing scroll is less efficient then the standard one,\u201d she huffed, \u201cBut he\u2019s using classic-Konoha style sealing while I fashion mine after the Uzumaki style. There\u2019s overlap of course, seeing how much the Uzumaki intermingled with Konoha, but still!\u201d\nJiraya was good at seals of course, almost a master, but he was nothing compared to the Uzumaki of old. Much had been lost with Ushiogakure. Jiraya had learned along-side Tsunade though, some from Uzumaki Mito and some from other refugees. Sarutobi had gotten him the best masters when he realized his students had a knack for it. All the sannin were seal masters, in their own right. Tsunade had helped bring even more seals into healing while Orochimaru had went the experimental seal route and Jiraya had stuck to classic sealing arts. \nTruth be told, Naruto would do better with Tenten and Genma, both trained in the Uzumaki style. Which was to say, the create-your-own style and not the classic repeating that Jiraya followed. Jiraya followed sealing rules religiously, as many did, and didn\u2019t care for experimenting or creation. Where-as the Uzumaki had been famous for their seals, for personal seal creation and using seals in battle. \nOn that note, Kakashi made a mental note to find some of Kushina\u2019s old scrolls for Naruto. He\u2019d hinted as much to the Hokage but the man had brushed him off and recommended Jiraya which meant he didn\u2019t want Naruto learning anything of his heritage yet. Kakashi didn\u2019t\u2019 know why, but he also knew the Hokage would not be happy with Kakashi already having given away details about Kushina to Naruto. \n\u201cWho won the argument?\u201d Kakashi asked, snapping back to attention as Tenten handed Naruto a scroll.\n\u201cNeither!\u201d Naruto answered, laughing, \u201cThey ran out of time!\u201d\n\u201cWe agreed to disagree,\u201d Tenten said, \u201cAnyways, make sure to study that tonight Naruto, I\u2019ll see you next week since Gai wants us to do some stuff tomorrow as a team.\u201d\n\u201cSee ya Tenten!\u201d Naruto waved enthusiastically as Tenten gave Kakashi a sloppy salute and disappeared into the bush again. \n\u201cSo you like your lessons with Genma and Tenten?\u201d Kakashi double checked with the blonde.\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Naruto cheered, \u201cGenma-sensei is awesome and Tenten is\u2026\u201d\nHe danced in spot a moment, energy making him vibrate.\n\u201cTenten is super cool!\u201d Naruto exploded, \u201cSensei! She has a giant scroll of weapons and she knows how to use them! And she likes seals that go boom! We made some explosive seals before she started arguing with Jiraya and she\u2019s so good at it! And she has this super cool spin move when using seals!\u201d\nNaruto made an approximate show of a spin and Kakashi laughed as he twirled. He was glad Naruto liked this arrangement. While Naruto might not still understand the Jiraya thing, he was being a kid and just loving life. And if he came out of it idolizing Gai\u2019s student and making a new friend there, well Kakashi was happy. \nAnd if Jiraya stepped one toe out of line again, Naruto had some friends close by that would make sure Jiraya was straightened out. Before Kakashi got to him. And then he would be in no way straightened out, he\u2019d be a lump in the hospital if he was still breathing. \n.--.\n\u201cHey, psst! Kakashi-sensei!\u201d\n\u201cNaruto,\u201d Kakashi sighed, rolling over, \u201cIt\u2019s 5am. Please tell me there are no more perverts for me deal with.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Naruto said pulling himself through Kakashi\u2019s open window.\nKakashi sighed and sat up as Naruto rolled onto the floor and then flopped into a sitting pose and frowned at the ground. Kakashi yawned and waited for Naruto and his odd thoughtful expression to speak.\n\u201cKakashi-sensei,\u201d Naruto finally started, \u201cWas the whole Jiraya thing my fault?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Kakashi asked, sharper than he had meant to.\n\u201cI mean,\u201d Naruto looked to the ground, \u201cI was thinkin\u2019 of it and stuff and how you and Sakura freaked out. Like, how none of that happened till I was in girl form. Is it my fault, cause I used my jutsu?\u201d\n\u201cNaruto,\u201d Kakashi said slowly, \u201cHow did you get the impression any of that was your fault.\n\u201cWell I mean it\u2019s my perverted jutsu,\u201d Naruto muttered.\n\u201cAnd how does making yourself into a girl make you perverted?\u201d Kakashi asked, trying to follow Naruto\u2019s train of thought.\n\u201cWell, Jiraya was good until I used it, so isn\u2019t it my fault? I mean he never did nothing when I was a guy, but when I was girl he said stuff and the only thing that changed was me.\u201d\n\u201cNaruto,\u201d Kakashi said gently. \u201cif you think that, then doesn\u2019t it stand to reason that any perverted stuff happens because there are girls? Like if Jiraya did that to Sakura it would be her fault because she\u2019s a girl.\u201d\n\u201cWhat!? No!\u201d Naruto said aghast.\n\u201cThen how does you being a girl make it your fault?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I mean, cause I\u2019m really a boy,\u201d Naruto said, \u201cCause I\u2019m tricking them.\u201d\nKakashi took a deep breath and tried to parse Naruto\u2019s logic.\n\u201cNaruto, can I ask you a question.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cDo you like being a girl?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Like do I like being in my jutsu?\u201d Naruto asked, \u201cWell, I dunno, I guess I don\u2019t really care to be honest.\u201d\nNaruto gave a shrug. \n\u201cSo you don\u2019t mind if people think you\u2019re a girl?\u201d Kakashi asked.\n\u201cNo?\u201d Naruto said like it was a trick question, \u201cI mean, girls and boys are pretty much the same, they just have different, you know, parts. Nuthin wrong with being a girl.\u201d\nKakashi leaned over and ruffled his hair. \n\u201cNaruto,\u201d Kakashi said softly, \u201cYou will be Naruto no matter if you use a jutsu to look like a girl. So it\u2019s not a trick because you are still you. Do you understand? If people treat you different because you use a jutsu to look like a girl, they\u2019re idiots.\u201d\nNaruto scrunched his brow and looked at the floor in a thoughtful silence.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Naruto finally nodded decidedly, \u201cI\u2019m Naruto. Even if I use a jutsu to give myself boobs it\u2019s not my fault because people should still know it\u2019s me and it ain\u2019t a trick.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cNow, I want you to remember as well that Jiraya is an adult and he made bad choices, none of which are your fault. You are not responsible for other people, only yourself.\u201d\nNaruto gave a solemn nod.\n\u201cNow, stop over thinking it and go sleep for another couple hours,\u201d Kakashi said. \nNaruto beamed and scurried for the window. Then he paused and lunged for Kakashi, wrapping him tightly in a hug that Kakashi returned.\n\u201cThanks, Kakashi-sensei,\u201d he murmured into Kakashi\u2019s shirt, \u201cYou\u2019re super smart and you always know what to say.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be like that when you\u2019re older too,\u201d Kakashi laughed, \u201cAs long as you keep studying!\u201d\nNaruto beamed and then vanished out the window leaving Kakashi to his last few hours of sleep. Kakashi rolled over and smiled. Naruto wasn\u2019t his brightest student but he was getting there. And he trusted Kakashi enough to come to him. Kakashi would never betray that trust. \n.--.\n\u201cBreath deeper,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cGet the chakra circulating completely through your lungs.\u201d\nSasuke released two quick sharp breaths and then inhaled deeply, chest puffing with the effort.\n\u201cNow release it slowly, focusing on the spark as it leaves your throat.\u201d\nSasuke hissed out his breath and what followed was a thin sheet of flame, so light it was almost white. Suddenly the flame stuttered and died out much to Sasuke\u2019s frustration. \n\u201cAlmost there,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cDo you feel the difference in temperature?\u201d\n\u201cMore control, the hotter the flame,\u201d Sasuke scowled.\n\u201cOr cooler,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cA basic fire jutsu will be an unrefined burst of flame; any controlled jutsu is much more flexible. You should be able to control the temperature and the spread of the flame.\u201d\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t hold it.\u201d\n\u201cYou will. Just keep practicing,\u201d Kakashi patted his head. \nSasuke nodded, brow furrowed as he absorbed the lessons Kakashi had already repeated before. \n\u201cPractice with that for a bit,\u201d Kakashi said.\nKakashi stood, leaving the boy crouched over the river to continue practicing, to go join Naruto on the bank. Sasuke was over the water because his flame kept flaring or guttering in a dangerous way and the water was an escape if he needed it. \n\u201cHow is your wind manipulation going?\u201d Kakashi asked.\n\u201cGood!\u201d Naruto cheered, \u201cWatch!\u201d\nAs he did so Naruto used his hands, not for hand signs but for some spinning gesture, and a whirlwind rose between them. A small twister of air that sent all the twigs, pebbles, and leaves spinning off. \n\u201cAnd what\u2019s the purpose of that?\u201d Kakashi asked, curious.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna master it so I can make a giant one!\u201d Naruto threw his hands up \nKakashi nodded and watched as Naruto formed another small whirlwind. He watched carefully as Naruto automatically used his wind-natured chakra to manipulate the currents. Whereas Sasuke had needed instruction, careful technical words with a good dose of instinct, Naruto was all instinct. He was using way too much chakra but it was making up for his lack of fine control. They had beaten some control into him but Naruto would always be better at using more chakra than controlling a fine thread of it.\n\u201cGood, good,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cNow where did Sakura slip off to?\u201d\nNaruto glanced around and then leaned close. Kakashi leaned in closer to let the boy cup a hand around his ear.\n\u201cI think she\u2019s sulking,\u201d Naruto whispered, looking around as if she would appear out of nowhere and hiss at him. \nKakashi looked into the trees concerned and nodded at Naruto. A clone peeled off of him, watching over both Sasuke and Naruto as Kakashi himself slipped into the trees. Sakura was\u2026well she was trying to hide it seemed. She\u2019d smothered her chakra, used all the tricks he\u2019d taught them on how to erase their scent, and just generally hid herself well. What she hadn\u2019t counted on though was his ninken. Shiba slipped out of the undergrowth and led Kakashi right to her. \nHis ninken had been helping supervise the kids training for weeks now unbeknownst to his kids. Sometimes if they were particularly sharp they\u2019d catch one or two and call them out and it had become a game to his ninken to stay completely hidden from them, stalking them. It was just back-up incase anything escaped Kakashi\u2019s eyes. Especially with Orochimaru targeting Sasuke and the whole throw down with Jiraya. Maybe he was paranoid but Kakashi preferred paranoid over dead. \nSo Shiba led him straight to Sakura who was hidden away in the thick roots of a tall tree, tucked completely out of sight and curled into a ball. \n\u201cHey, What\u2019s up?\u201d Kakashi asked as he leaned over the small hidey hole. \n\u201cI can\u2019t get it,\u201d Sakura sniffled, \u201cI just can\u2019t get the stupid nature chakra manipulation.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cI know it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s probably extra hard for you. Sasuke has some old family training in the fire arts to fall back onto and Naruto has such a strong wind affinity he\u2019s going to get this pretty easy. But your nature affinity is pretty weak. I told you we would have to work twice as hard on yours.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I can\u2019t even move the ground! And Sasuke is making flame with half hand-signs and Naruto is making whirlwinds with none! And I-I all I can do is sense the chakra! I can only make the ground in front of me shake a tiny little bit!\nShe burst into tears, curling into a tighter ball and Kakashi made soothing noises and gently rubbed her back.\n\u201cHey now Sakura,\u201d he smiled softly, \u201cIt\u2019s only the second day of this sort of training. Besides, you know what? Even if you never master your affinity you will still be a good shinobi.\u201d\nShe sobbed on but he could see how she was listening closely.\n\u201cSakura, we already talked about how you will never be a ninjutsu powerhouse, but that\u2019s only one of many arts. You\u2019re already amazing with herb and poison lore, you are mastering taijutsu faster than Naruto, your strength is better than either of the boys, and your genjutsu is on its way to flawless. And that\u2019s not even touching on things like your hammer or your teamwork.\u201d\nShe sniffled and snuffled into her knees and then slowly peeked up at him, eyes red and puffy, snot dripping from her nose. Like this, curled up and sobbing, she looked so much younger than twelve, almost thirteen. He never forgot that these three were kids, but sometimes he forgot how young of kids they were. They were all just children and despite how mature and strong they were, they were still growing and learning. They were still kids at heart and they had a right to be; so Sakura was allowed to get frustrated to tears.\n\u201cYou know Sakura, that strength isn\u2019t everything,\u201d he said gently, \u201cDo you know how proud I am of you?\u201d\nShe looked up at him fully and he smiled, reaching up to brush her hair out of her face and gently wipe at her cheeks. \n\u201cSakura, you have survived everything I threw at you, no matter how hard or scary. You have kept up with two boys who had leaps of a head start on you in a variety of ways. You have started to find what you are best at, what you like to do. And through it all you have been watching over everyone. I see the way you make sure Naruto and Sasuke eat well and keep the place tidy. I see the way you always watch their backs, are always aware of them on and off the field. Sakura, you came to my place at 3am because you were so concerned for Naruto. I am so very proud of you.\u201d\nSakura burst into noisy tears again, but this time instead of curling into a ball, trying to block everything out, she threw herself at him and he carefully hugged the lapful of crying child back. He let her have her cry, humming faintly as he rubbed soothing circles in her back. When she slowly let the tears fade away and the sobs get swallowed up, she still held onto him tightly. \n\u201cCan I tell you two secrets,\u201d Kakashi smiled after a few minutes, \u201cthat the boys don\u2019t know.\u201d\nSakura peeked up at him, and puffy face and all she looked curious.\n\u201cFirst, Sasuke\u2019s nature affinity isn\u2019t fire, it\u2019s lightening,\u201d he grinned.\nShe blinked in surprise, mouth opening in a little \u2018o\u2019. \n\u201cSo you\u2019re making him work twice as hard,\u201d Sakura spluttered. \n\u201cYup!\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cHe just assumed it was fire and went with it. It\u2019s a lesson on assumptions and I\u2019ll make sure you can see his face the day I tell him his real nature affinity is lightening.\u201d\nShe bit her lip, looking outraged and amused all in one and he grinned at her. \n\u201cThe second secret is that using Nature Chakra like I\u2019m training you three to do,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cIs a high chunin-level skill. Often taught to those hoping to become Jonin.\u201d\nShe blinked, trying to fully understand what he was saying.\n\u201cA-are,\u201d she stuttered, \u201cAre you teaching us Jonin exam skills!?\u201d\n\u201cMah, and you\u2019re doing so well!\u201d Kakashi chirped.\n\u201cY-You,\u201d she spluttered, \u201cThat\u2019s why this is so hard!\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet you\u2019re getting it,\u201d Kakashi cheered.\nShe glared up at him, fuming at his tricks but he simply beamed back at her until she grumbled her annoyance away. \n\u201cYou really think we can do this?\u201d Sakura asked.\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Kakashi said instantly.\nShe peered up at him as if to gauge his honesty and slowly a shy smile crept across her face. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d she nodded.\n\u201cOkay?\u201d he smiled.\nShe gave another sharp nod and pushed herself to her feet.\n\u201cTell me what I\u2019m doing wrong,\u201d she said, her face set and stubborn.\nKakashi smiled widely, bursting with pride.\n.--. \n\u201cWe need haircuts,\u201d Sakura declared one afternoon, \u201cAll of us.\u201d\nShe sent Kakashi a pointed look and he tugged a lock of hair down to eye it. His hair really was getting long and unruly. He\u2019d been trimming it himself for years with a kunai, but one look at Sakura\u2019s face told him the pinkette wouldn\u2019t allow that. Her hair, chopped off during training, now reached her shoulders in a straight bob while Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s spilled over their headbands. \n\u201cMah, I suppose we could stop on the way home,\u201d he allowed.\nSakura nodded in agreement and then went back to squabbling with Naruto about the placement of a trap on their map. \nThat night, on the way home they stopped in a barbers and Naruto and Sasuke hoped into the chairs with no hesitation, shrugging when asked what they wanted. The barber shrugged too and ended up giving Naruto pretty short hair that wouldn\u2019t be such a rat\u2019s nest. Sasuke stopped the man to keep his hair a little longer and it was pretty close to what he had left the academy with, back spiking up and bangs laying heavy. Kakashi let the man hack a lot of his off too but kept enough that it still looked mussed as it stood up. \nThen Sakura got in the chair and told him to chop most of it off.\n\u201cEh!\u201d Naruto voiced for them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s annoying,\u201d Sakura told him matter-of-fact.\n\u201cBut-but I thought you were growing it out again,\u201d Naruto pouted.\nShe snorted at him and told the barber to keep cutting. The Sakura that stepped out of the chair, hair brushed and cape taken off, had a short boy cut, hair just covering the tips of her ears but shaved below that and at the back of her neck. It suited her quite well Kakashi noted, if made her look much younger. She seemed happy with it if her flounce was any indication. \nKakashi ruffled it just to make her squawk. Mah, his kids were growing up so fast. \n.--.\n\u201cGood job Naruto!\u201d Sakura cheered as even Sasuke gave Naruto a nod of approval. \nNaruto gave a wide grin, rubbing the back of his head in embracement at the praise. Behind him lay three sliced logs. \n\u201cVery flashy,\u201d Kakashi nodded, \u201cAnd good cuts. But not very practical hmm?\u201d\nThe logs had been sliced neatly with his scythe, the manipulating of the chain allowing him to hit three targets one after the other despite not being anywhere near close in a row. \n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work on people,\u201d Naruto nodded, \u201cNot enough force behind the swing enough to cut deep enough, but it could knock away weapons or cut through exploding tags if they were holding them up. \n\u201cSo it\u2019s for disarming,\u201d Kakashi smiled.\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Naruto said, \u201cAnd I mean if I hit their hands at the same time it would really be disarming!\u201d\nHe laughed at his own joke even as the rest of them groaned. \n\u201cOkay Sasuke, you\u2019re up,\u201d Kakashi nodded at the boy.\nNaruto helpfully made a row of clones and Sasuke pulled his Satsuma free of his back, spinning it rather show-offish. Kakashi watched with pride and amusement at the show his students made. They liked to be flashy, but underneath that was practicality and skill so he allowed it. He already knew that in battle they would never try to be this showy; they knew better. \nSasuke expertly pinned his opponent after knocking the other\u2019s away smoothly, with an underlying hint of violence. \n\u201cSakura,\u201d Kakashi nodded.\nSakura was still mastering her Hammer, but she had a better grasp on it than before. While Sasuke used his Satsuma when needed, it was not his go to think. When Naruto used his chain and scythe it was often for long-ranged attack, but also not his preferred strategy. On the other hand, Sakura was far quicker to use her weapon, pairing it with her main tactic of taijutsu in every battle it could be used in. The fact that she was good at broad destruction with her hammer and that she could incorporate it in her straight forward \u2018smash em\u2019 approach was helpful. She was getting better at wielding it as well, learning to use her whole body behind it while also allowing herself to go with the swing and pull of such a heavy weapon. \nKakashi watched as she left craters in her wake as she smashed the clones in front of her. He\u2019d have to remember to get her working on Tsunade\u2019s technique if she kept up such strength building and such good chakra control.\n.--.\n.--.\nKakashi glanced up as Asuma and Kurenai entered the clearing, slipping out of the bush. Kakashi lifted a hand in a lazy greeting from where he was sitting cross-legged and slouched against a boulder, Icha Icha in hand for once. \n\u201cMorning,\u201d Asuma greeted.\n\u201cAfternoon,\u201d Kurenai corrected raising a brow at the midday sun. \n\u201cClose enough,\u201d Asuma yawned, scratching the back of his head. \n\u201cYour kids coming?\u201d Kakashi raised a brow at them.\n\u201cTold them to meet us here,\u201d Kurenai smiled, \u201cWe thought we could show up a bit early and make plans.\u201d\n\u201cSure, sure. How do you want to play this?\u201d Kakashi asked as he looked around the field.\nIt was one of the more distance training grounds just on the outskirts of Konoha and was popular for the reason it was a varied field. Many of the training yards around Konoha were simple and of the same terrain, either all bush or cleared grass or river. This one had a nice cropping of large boulders beside a small cliff face and a waterfall that fell into a deep creek, but also some thorn bushes and scrub before a tree line. It was also a tad large than many of the closer training grounds. \n\u201cIno has been complaining non-stop about how she lost her match while Sakura won hers,\u201d Asuma sighed, \u201cAnd complaining how she didn\u2019t get to face Sakura so I was hoping for some sparing. Plus, I think my kids got spooked by the exam and could use some interaction with some of the teams to ease them.\u201d\n\u201cKiba is the same,\u201d Kurenai laughed, \u201cAnd the exam didn\u2019t quite scare them so much as it made them realize they needed to step up their training.\u201d\n\u201cWell we could do some sparring,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cBut I was hoping to do some team exercises.\u201d\n\u201cTeam exercises?\u2019 Kurenai asked. \n\u201cMy team vs. yours,\u201d Kakashi smiled. \n\u201cThen mine after?\u201d Asuma nodded.\n\u201cNo, both of yours at the same time,\u201d Kakashi smiled wider.\nThe pair was silent for a moment. \n\u201cYou think they could take both our teams?\u201d Kurenai asked with narrowed eyed.\nHe could see the annoyance, see how she was not happy he was dismissing her kids. But, well, Kakashi knew how this was going to go.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d like to start with that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m up for it,\u201d Asuma said, eyes glinting. \nAsuma had known Kakashi far longer, could see the glee in his face and wanted to see what he thought was going to happen. \n\u201cWhere are your students by the way,\u201d Kurenai asked abruptly.\nAs if summoned there was a shout and all three jonin looked up in time to see Naruto do a wild flail and then belly flop straight into the deep water right near the waterfall. Sakura and Sasuke peeked over the waterfall after the blonde who hit the water with a sharp smack. Sakura was roaring with laughter and Kakashi could even see Sasuke\u2019s faint smirk. And then they were throwing themselves after him, laughing as they tumbled much more gracefully into the water. Kakashi smiled as they breeched the surface, still gasping with laughter while Naruto whined. They pulled themselves from the water squabbling, after a couple splashes, and bee-lined for Kakashi who held up a towel from the bag beside him. \nSakura snatched the towel first and shimmied the water off herself while Naruto shook like a dog and Sasuke shoved his wet hair back. They were still arguing about who had pushed Naruto as they finished drying off and tugged some clothes on over their bathing suits. Kakashi let Sakura dig some granola bars out of the bag as his kids quieted down and glanced at the two new adults. \n\u201cYo, this is Asuma and Kurenai,\u201d Kakashi introduced the jonin. \n\u201cHello,\u201d Sakura greeted for them., \u201cIts nice to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cHello,\u201d Kurenai said smiling, \u201cHaving a swim?\u201d\n\u201cWe were practicing water walking in the current while we sparred. Naruto needs all the practice he can get for it,\u201d Sakura smiled, \u201cBut then Sasuke pushed Naruto and it started a water fight.\n\u201cYou pushed him first,\u201d Sasuke grunted.\n\u201cDid not,\u201d Sakura shot back immediately. \nThey were interrupted by the sound of approaching people and they all turned to watch Team Eight and Team Ten spill into the clearing. \n\u201cSensei!\u201d the Inuzuka boy shouted happily, \u201cWe found Team Ten on our way here!\u201d\n\u201cYou mean ran into,\u201d Yamanaka Ino snapped, \u201cSensei why is dog-boy here?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because we told both of you to meet here,\u201d Asuma smirked. \n\u201cYou!\u201d Yamanaka yelped, suddenly spotting Sakura.\nKakashi chuckled quietly as his student responded with a taunting smirk and a cheery little wave. \n\u201cThis is going to be so troublesome,\u201d the Nara scowled, eyes darting between the teams as he came up with his own conclusion.\n\u201cW-what are we d-doing sensei?\u201d Hyuuga Hinata asked nervously.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do some friendly team training!\u201d Kakashi answered for Kurenai with a cheerful chirp. \nThe other kids all leaned away from Kakashi\u2019s grin looking a little freaked out but Team Seven just rolled their eyes, used to his off-putting nature when he was having fun torturing them. They knew that this time he wasn\u2019t going to be torturing them but the other kids. Kakashi eyed his own students and their confidence and turned a warmer grin on them. They had come so far. \n\u201cSo here\u2019s the rules,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cNaruto, Sakura, and Sasuke will each carry a bell. Whichever team retrieves the most wins.\u201d\nNaruto and Sakura grinned, wide and sharp, while Sasuke smirked between them, each holding up a small silver bell before tying it to their waist. None of them looked very intimidating all decked out in civvies; shorts and t-shirts. Naruto\u2019s even had a silly doodle on it and Sakura had a large sunflower printed on hers. The only thing remotely ninja about them were the sandals strapped tight and the one kunai pouch each. \n\u201cYou can use anything you want, weapons, taijutsu, ninjutsu, genjutsus, whatever. You have one hour and have to stay in this training ground limits. It\u2019s a team effort remember. Got it?\u201d Kakashi asked lightly.\nAll the kids seemed slightly caught off guard by the sudden game announced, shifting and exchanging quick looks with their smiling sensei. But they rallied quick enough. The Ino-Cho-Shika team exchanged sharp nods, signs passing between them silently. Team Eight barely looked at one another as they, each in their own way, tagged Team Seven. \n\u201cWell then, good-luck,\u201d Kakashi eye-smiled, \u201cUs sensei will be keeping an eye on things so just ignore us if you see us. Now, ready, set\u2026\u201d\nThey all tensed. \n\u201cGo,\u201d Kakashi said flicking the timer.\nSakura, Sasuke and Naruto moved instantly and as one, their movements quick but graceful as Naruto went high, Sasuke went low, and Sakura went dead forwards. Naruto let out a loud cackling howl and Sakura gave a war cry even as Sasuke vanished from everyone\u2019s senses. It was a tactic to unnerve; and unnerve it did, jolting half the kids out of formation as they started. \nNaruto fell on Team Ten with all the force of a hurricane, clones blossoming around him like weeds as he forced them to scatter, cutting off the team praised for teamwork. Sakura meanwhile slammed into Team Eight, scattering them as they all tried to dodge her wild throws. Sasuke it seemed, had vanished but the kids didn\u2019t have time to worry about that as they tried to fend off the other two. But as quickly as it had happened, everything slowed. Because Sakura and Naruto popped like bubbles, revealing that they had switched with clones. \nThe field settled with silence for a long moment as the other two teams blinked in shock. \n\u201cWell,\u201d Kakashi raised a brow, \u201cThey\u2019re somewhere in this training ground and you have bells to get.\u201d\nThey flinched into motion, ducking into the surrounding bush. Kakashi turned a smile on Kurenai and Asuma and they both shook their heads fondly before ducking after their teams to observe. Kakashi pulled his Icha Icha out again. No point in wasting his very limited reading time. \n.--.\nKakashi watched as Sasuke shrieked with glee, her hammer a glint in the sun as she slammed it where Team Ten had stood. They let out shrieks as well, but they were not of glee as Sakura became a whirlwind armed with a heavy hammer. She was a force of nature as she whirled and twirled and spun, the clang of her hammer against the earth particularly loud with her enthusiasm. \n\u201cHold still!\u201d Sakura laughed like a maniac.\n\u201cFuck that!\u201d the blonde girl, shrieked back even as the Akimichi enlarged his hand and tried to swat Sakura out of the air. \nThe boy\u2019s hand grazed her hammer and Sakura let it go before it was ripped out of her hands, using her momentum to throw herself over the large hand. The Nara was crouched, hands clasped in a sign as he shadow stretched for where Sakura would land. But when Sakura actually hit the ground she shattered into a spray of cherry blossoms.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the kids gaped as the petals floated to the ground leaving no one in sight. \nKakashi raised a brow from his hidden vantage point in the tree. That had been a well combined genjutsu along with an earth style jutsus that had helped Sakura slip into the earth like it was water. \nKakashi watched idly as the kids whispered furiously trying to regroup. Only a bit of a ways off Sakura crawled out of the earth behind a tree and slapped her hand to Naruto\u2019s, tagging him in. Kakashi left them too it and sought out Sasuke as a sphere of fire bloomed in the air closer to the creek.\n.--.\n\u201cYour kids are hellions,\u201d Asuma hissed.\nKakashi chuckled lowly beside him, both keeping track of the kids running about below them. He saw Kurenai and Asuma shifting, saw the calculation rent on their faces, how they watched his kids with shadowed eyes. The chunin exams had been one thing, but his kids had been beat to hell and back on their last bit of energy. Here, healthy and energetic, they were taking the other two teams apart, bit by bit and enjoying it. \nSure it was a sort of childish fun, a small thrilled smile here, laughter there, but the fact was they were dominating and they knew it; and they were taking joy in it. \nSasuke smirked openly as he set an exploding tag off. Watching the panic bloom across the Aburame\u2019s face before smoke erupted with a loud bang. They Hyuuga was squeaking, yelling out Sasuke\u2019s location even through the lavender scented smoke, while Inuzuka cursed up a storm. Sakura was hovering near the teachers, hanging from a branch as she tracked the people in the smoke. She was keeping an eye on Sasuke but not actively helping him. Naruto meanwhile was just around the corner setting up a web of wires to catch anyone who was led that way.\nNot a single one of the other kids had touched a bell. \nAsuma and Kurenai exchanged a look and Kakashi flipped a page in his Icha Icha. Below them Sasuke tagged Sakura in and she went spinning away, chasing the teams into Naruto\u2019s webs.\n\u00a0\n.--.\n\u201cWell, wasn\u2019t that fun?\u201d Kakashi chirped. \nAll the kids groaned at him, even his own team was panting and sweaty. Kakashi sent his kids a narrowed-eyed look. They stared back at him for a long moment, confusion evident. He saw them think about why he could possibly be disappointed when they had won. It was surprisingly Naruto who realized first, eyes flying wide and knocking his elbows ino the other two and whispering quickly, hands flapping. Sakura and Sasuke blinked then looked to Kakashi with wide eyes. They all looked\nat their feet sheepishly. \nHe had not been impressed with their team-work today. Oh they had worked as a team for sure, but not actively. They had simply worked independently while being together. They\u2019d all gotten a tad too caught up in rivalries and having fun. Kakashi had said it was a team exercise and he hadn\u2019t just meant for the other two teams. \n\u201cYou\u2019re monsters,\u201d the Inuzuka boy groaned.\nNaruto gave a minute instinctive flinch at the word and Sakura and Sasuke sent sharp glares at the boy.\n\u201cYou just suck, dog boy,\u201d Yamanaka groaned.\n\u201cYou all suck,\u201d Sasuke spoke aloud to the surprise of most.\nA couple of the kids blinked at the full sentence that had just come out of Sasuke but then the realized the insult and made protests.\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Naruto laughed, \u201cYa didn\u2019t get any bells!\u201d\nThe Nara heir was watching Team Seven with sharp eyes, hair in a disarray and sweat coating his brow, but looking completely focused. \n\u201cGuess we need to step up our training hey?\u201d Asuma laughed at his kids. \nThe Yamanaka started to squabble with him as the Aburame told Kurenai they needed more training as well. Kakashi watched as the Nara sidled up beside him discreetly.\n\u201cWhat training have you given them?\u201d the Nara asked. \n\u201cHmm? Oh you know, some of this, some of that,\u201d Kakashi hummed. \nThe Nara narrowed his eyes again and Kakashi met his gaze with a slight tilt of his head. He could practically see the kid thinking a mile a minute. \n\u201cYou were ANBU,\u201d the kid finally stated.\nKakashi raised a brow. That wasn\u2019t really a secret these days, but definitely wasn\u2019t well known either. He wondered if the boy had overheard his father talking about it. Or if he had figured it out on his own. \n\u201cSure,\u201d Kakashi eye smiled, neither confirming or denying.\n\u201c\u2026Are you training them for ANBU?\u201d the kid narrowed his eyes.\n\u201cNope,\u201d Kakashi smiled, a tad more sharply. \nIf Kakashi had his way, no one under the age of twenty would ever be an ANBU. ANBU wasn\u2019t about strength, wasn\u2019t a mark of power; it was where the killers went. Not those who could kill in the line of duty, but those who were particularly good at it. Kakashi was making his students powerhouses, but he was not making them merciless killers. And if ANBU tried to approach them while he was still their teacher, they would remember why Kakashi had been an ANBU commander, the king of the killers. \n\u201c\u2026You\u2019ve had no other students than ANBU though,\u201d the boy remarked with narrowed eyes, \u201cSo you only know how to train ANBU.\u201d\nPeople came to ANBU because they were good killers, not because they were always good at other things. Kakashi had been responsible for making sure they got good enough to survive ANBU. You didn\u2019t always enter ANBU powerful or extremely skilled, but you left it so. \nKakashi met the Nara\u2019s eyes squarely but gave no response.\n\u201cHmph,\u201d Nara huffed, \u201cWe had no chance.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed blandly.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been under your tutelage for seven months and most of that was out of Konoha,\u201d the boy mulled, \u201cYou\u2019ve been training them hard.\u201d\n\u201cVery.\u201d\nThey eyed one another, Kakashi appreciative of the kid\u2019s genius and Nara eyeing him like he was a feral dog. Well, that\u2019s how all the Nara eyed people too enthusiastic about work. \n\u201cHmph,\u201d the boy finally rolled his shoulders into a slouch, \u201cTroublesome. We should play shogi one day.\u201d \n\u201cOne genius against another,\u201d Kakashi agreed.\nThe boy gave him a tight grim smile and wandered back to his sensei. \n.--.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think sensei is happy with us,\u201d Naruto whispered softly.\nKakashi perked up at the sound of his title and silently rolled closer to the edge of the roof. There was a rotation of ANBU and night patrol that made sure to do hourly patrols past the Hatake compound because of the threat of Orochimaru still hanging in the air, but Kakashi sometimes got that little buzzing paranoia that made him sit on the roof himself. \nHe hadn\u2019t told the kids either of those facts though. Maybe they were smart enough to keep an eye out, or maybe they were allowed to be kids and not have to worry every hour of the day; either way Kakashi sometimes silently sat here. Wasn\u2019t his fault the kids kept the windows open during the night for the breeze. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sakura sighed in answer to Naruto.\nBoth voices were pitched moderately and would never make it far, but for someone with his hearing and sitting right above them he could hear them well. \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really use a lotta teamwork did we,\u201d Naruto mumbled.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sasuke snorted, \u201cWe did tag out though.\u201d\n\u201cWe coordinated well,\u201d Sakura agreed, \u201cBut I think he wanted us to show the other teams that we have some good teamwork, not just strength.\u201d\n\u201cWe could have crushed them as a team,\u201d Naruto whined, \u201cI thought it was just some sparing.\u201d\n\u201cEverything\u2019s a test with sensei,\u201d Sakura scolded him, \u201cI think we were supposed to work together and beat them just enough to show them what teamwork could do.\u201d\n\u201cThey got some good teamwork though,\u201d Naruto protested, \u201cWhy do we have to show them?\u201d\n\u201cTheir teamwork comes from association,\u201d Sasuke grunted.\n\u201cAssociation?\u201d Naruto groaned, \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d\n\u201cAssociation means they know each other and have worked together before. So it\u2019s not new to them. Ino, Choji, and Shikamaru have grown up together and knew they would be put on the same team so they have former knowledge of each other to work well,\u201d Sakura explained, \u201cKiba, Shino, and Hinata also have known each other for years due to clan stuff and being the children of clan heads. They would have had play dates and Kiba and Shino\u2019s family especially push teamwork.\u201d\n\u201cThen why do we have to show them teamwork??\u2019 Naruto asked plainly.\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re lazy about it,\u201d Sasuke snorted. \n\u201cSasuke\u2019s right,\u201d Sakura agreed, \u201cThey work well and think because they can work together and know each other, they don\u2019t need to work on their teamwork as much as individual skill. We\u2019re the opposite. Remember when sensei kept dropping us in the forest?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d Naruto groaned as if pained. \n\u201cThat was all teamwork building. We had to work together. He didn\u2019t really start giving us formal training for over a month because of that. He showed us straight off the bat that our teamwork was even more important than our individual skills, that even with minimal training we can do stuff as long as we work together and help each other,\u201d Sakura said, \u201cThe other teams are taught to be individuals first, taught clan stuff, and then told to mesh whereas we were thrown together and then started to be taught only after we learned how to fit together.\u201d\nKakashi smiled on the roof, so proud they had read the message and taken it to heart.\n\u201cBut we still beat them by ourselves,\u201d Naruto pointed out. \n\u201cYes because we have been doing a ridiculous amount of training,\u201d Sakura huffed, \u201cYou said it at the beginning, we beat them by ourselves but as a team we would have demolished them. Kakashi wanted to show the other kids that while we could whoop them individually, the real strength is teamwork.\u201d\nSasuke grunted a verbal agreement and Naruto mumbled something along those lines as well. \n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll just have to do it again next week then,\u201d Naruto declared.\nSakura laughed but didn\u2019t disagree. Kakashi rolled back onto his side and gazed up at the stars, a smile lingering on his lips. They were such good kids.\n.--.\n\u201cWhat is it you wanted from here?\u201d Kakashi asked, tone carefully made to be at ease.\n\u201cMy father had a lot of fire jutsu scrolls,\u201d Sasuke said, sliding the door open, obviously still upset he was having trouble with his fire manipulation.\nKakashi stepped into the silent dusty house and carefully stayed half a step behind Sasuke. Kakashi glanced around as they walked; taking in the layer of dust on everything. Sasuke had kept the place tidy while living here, but Kakashi could see signs that Sasuke had barely touched anything at the same time. He had probably kept to his own things, not disturbing his mother\u2019s bowls in the cupboard or his father\u2019s study. \nKakashi frowned and hunched straightened enough he was looming over Sasuke, like a protective shadow. Sasuke seemed to take no note of it and walked steadily, eyes focused on his feet. Kakashi tried not to wonder what living in this tomb had done to Sasuke over the years. He could only console himself by reassuring himself they had gotten Sasuke out in the end. \nThe sound of their footsteps was loud in the silence and Kakashi could hear how carefully Sasuke was regulating his breathing. \n\u201cWhere are they?\u201d Kakashi asked.\n\u201cSealed in my father\u2019s study,\u201d Sasuke answered stopping before a sliding paper door. \nEverything in the Uchiha compound had been swept over and sealed. They said it was because they were looking for evidence of Itachi\u2019s crimes, but sometimes Kakashi had the feeling it was for other evidence and reasons. Like a good shinobi he had said nothing. Now, after having walked the emptied district and watched as Sasuke got quieter and quieter, he wished he could go get answers. Instead he pushed past Sasuke and opened the former study. \nStacks upon stacks of large official sealing scrolls lined the walls. These were the official seals that Konoha handed to the family on the death of a shinobi. The first line held the urn and ashes of the deceased, the rest held all their belongings. All they had been in one scroll.\nKakashi could see the broken seals, see how Sasuke had gone through every single one and removed the ashes to be buried in the Uchiha plot. Everything else had remained sealed. \nThis had at one time been the Uchiha Clan Head\u2019s study, and under all the scrolls Kakashi could see it was also untouched. Bookshelves were organized and neat, blood-locked scrolls still sitting on them. \n\u201cPoint me to them,\u201d Kakashi said.\nSasuke stood in the doorway, not a single hair of his in the room and pointed wordlessly at the far right shelf. Kakashi loaded his arms without regard to gentleness and then stepped out of the room, shutting the door with a decisive click. Sasuke took some of the scrolls and followed Kakashi out of the house and out of the compound. He sealed the gates under Kakashi\u2019s careful eye and then finally looked away from his feet up at his sensei.\n\u201cYou are not to go back there alone,\u201d Kakashi ordered him. \nSasuke got a mulish look on his face, one the sullen boy gave when he was ordered about. But underneath that, Kakashi could see a spark of relief deep in his eyes. With a firm order like that, Sasuke would have an excuse not to enter again. Otherwise duty might have guided his feet. \n\u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d Kakashi said more gently.\nSasuke followed without a single look back. And when Naruto and Sakura greeted them back at the Hatake manor with wide beaming smiles and a full plate of tomato sandwiches, Sasuke smiled.\n.--.\nKakashi looked down at his empty cup and didn\u2019t allow himself to frown. He looked back up at the couple that was watching him closely. Haruno Kizashi and Haruno Mebuki were an average couple; they held normal shop jobs, had a tidy small house, and were content with life. Kizashi had been a genin many years ago, but had not passed his jonin sensei\u2019s test and never officially became a true genin. Mebuki was the daughter of an influential merchant. While Kizashi was a first generation Konoha citizen, his wife was not. They were both involved in their community and up to date on all the fire country politics. \nThey were also only slightly aware of what being a shinobi entailed.\nThe key part was they understood it was dangerous, lots of hard work, and always a tad odd. They had accepted the fact that Sakura had to dedicate many hours and nights to her training, had even approved of her diligence. That she only saw them partially on Sundays was accepted, albeit sadly. \n\u201cThank you for the tea,\u201d he said. \n\u201cAny time, sensei,\u201d they bowed, \u201cPlease consider our request.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d Kakashi bowed back before making his escape.\nThe Haruno family had put forth a simple request; more time with their daughter. And Kakashi had been reluctant to agree. Now he was wondering why. Maybe he was too used to independence, too used to being alone, too used to being an orphan. Sometimes he forgot that Sakura still had family that loved and cared for her. And he felt bad keeping her from that, but he knew the work he did with her was making sure she would survive to be loved by her family for years to come. \nKakashi entered the Hatake Manor with light steps but heavy thoughts.\n\u201cHey Sakura,\u201d Kakashi called.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Sakura asked, poking her head out the kitchen door.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked.\nSakura blushed and mumbled something.\n\u201cAre you doing their dishes?\u201d Kakashi asked sternly.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind doing dishes,\u201d she protested, \u201cBesides, I got Naruto to agree to do trash for the week instead.\u201d\nKids and chores, Kakashi sighed.\n\u201cWell, leave it be. We\u2019ve got a mission,\u201d he declared.\n\u201cA mission?\u201d she blinked, \u201cAren\u2019t we off active duty?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important mission,\u201d he said as if he hadn\u2019t heard her, \u201cfull of peril and danger, exhaustive and frightening.\u201d\nShe scrunched up her nose and gave him that skeptical look she gave him when she thought he was joking. She really was getting better at picking out his teasing.\n\u201cWe have to\u2026\u201d he paused dramatically, \u201cGo shopping!\u201d\nShe rolled her eyes so hard he was surprised she didn\u2019t roll them back into her skull but she also giggled so he counted it as a win.\n\u201cShould I go get the boys?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cDo you want them to come?\u201d he asked.\nShe considered it.\n\u201cCan we get anmitsu after?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d he shrugged.\n\u201cThen let\u2019s go without them,\u201d she brightened, \u201cNeither of them like shopping nor anmitsu.\u201d\nKakashi nodded and let her finish up the dishes. They made their way out of the Hatake compound with Pakkun on their heels and set off. First they grabbed a few essentials, grabbing some groceries and going through a general goods store. Then Kakashi took Sakura to the armory and helped her fill in paper work for their kunai, shuriken, and ninja wire. They got the standard kits, cashing in their month\u2019s allowance for said kit, and then took extra forms with them when they left for Naruto; said blond would need to apply for more supplies under trap specialization. That would give him more supplies for smoke bombs, wire, and anything else he might need as long as he could prove he was actually making progress with that specialization. Kakashi supposed all Naruto would really need to do was get Umino\u2019s signature on the papers. \nKakashi led the way after that, and they went to the same shinobi clothes store as last time. It took a bit of asking before the clerk found a box in the back that had similar kimono tops that they had been wearing before.\n\u201cGenerally, these places carry more than just one of the same outfit. Shinobi are pretty rough on clothes, even clothes built to withstand more damage,\u201d Kakashi told Sakura as she flipped through the colored kimono tops. \nThere weren\u2019t any identical to their old ones, but they found a few orange ones with various prints including red spider lilies that Naruto would love. Sasuke would be getting some dark grey and blue ones with various mountain and bird prints. And for Sakura they found a variety of purple and light pink tops that had flower patterns blooming across them. Kakashi was actually quite glad with the choice of Kimono top because they all came in child or adult size, no in between. You wrapped it tighter of tied up the sleeves if they didn\u2019t fit and that was that for his growing student. \nKakashi didn\u2019t let Sakura pay by claiming it as training expenses and smacking her wallet out of her hand. By the time she\u2019d picked the wallet up he had already paid and the clerk had bagged the outfits with a wink. \nThen they had anmitsu, and Sakura\u2019s ire faded away to a happy smile as she ate her treat beneath the evening sun and Kakashi relaxed.\n\u201cAre you okay with all the training Sakura?\u201d he asked under the sun.\nShe eyes him oddly.\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d she said slowly, \u201cIs this a trick question?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he waved a hand, \u201cJust wondering if you want more time off to see your family.\u201d\nSakura shrugged, shoveling anmitsu into her mouth.\n\u201cI see them enough. I mean, I still see them once a week,\u201d she said, \u201cBesides, this is important.\u201d\n\u201cYou could be at home right now instead of doing chores around the Hatake Manor,\u201d he pointed out. \nShe gave him a weird look again.\n\u201cI am home, sensei,\u201d she said as if she was talking about the sky being blue, \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to live with my parents for ever you know.\u201d\nHe wondered if he should mention most people didn\u2019t move out of their parent\u2019s home at twelve. But he kept his mouth shut seeing her turn back to her dessert. Maybe he should be more proactive and tell her to go see her parents more often, but to be honest, he thought that was up to her. She knew she was allowed and knew she only had to ask for the time. If she was happy here with them then he would leave it alone. \nAfter all, he just wished for them to be happy.\n.--.\n\u201cLook Sensei!\u201d Naruto said holding up the plate.\n\u201cAh, those look good Naruto,\u201d Kakashi smiled. \nNaruto beamed, plate still held up like an offering. Kakashi tugged his mask down and reached out, popping the lopsided gyoza into his mouth. When Iruka came around the corner half were gone and his mask back up while Naruto did a happy little jig.\n\u201cTeaching him to make Gyoza, sensei?\u201d Kakashi smiled.\n\u201cHe said he wanted to learn how too cook more,\u201d Iruka smiled simply, \u201cWe went over some studying while we did so too. He studies better when he can do something with his hands.\u201d\nNaruto nodded agreement and then went careening back to the kitchen yelling about packing some for Sasuke and Sakura. \n\u201cThank you for spending the evening with him,\u201d Kakashi bowed his head.\nHe\u2019d been asked by Yugao to give her a hand with another Jonin. She\u2019d cashed in on one of the many favors he owed her and helped her chunin friend learn how to do a fire jutsu. He didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d requested his help for that but it had been an easy request. He\u2019d sent Sakura off to Gai for some extra evening training and taken Sasuke with him because the boy was obsessing over fire jutsu right now and it did him good to work with others outside the team. Naruto he\u2019d sent off to Iruka\u2019s with a few scrolls to study. Iruka hadn\u2019t sent him back so Kakashi had gone to fetch him as the hour grew late. \n\u201cIt was a pleasure,\u201d Iruka tilted his head.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Naruto cheered sliding his sandals on, \u201cWe gotta get these to them before they get cold!\u201d\n\u201cTrain Hard Naruto,\u201d Iruka smiled.\nNaruto simply lunged for a hug, face still beaming. Then they were off into the streets, Naruto babbling about the work they had done and how Iruka was the best gyoza maker ever. \n\u201cMah, I\u2019m glad you had fun,\u201d Kakashi said, ruffling his hair as Naruto bounced beside him.\n\u201cIruka is the best,\u201d Naruto grinned, \u201cHe always makes things make sense.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Kakashi nodded. \nNaruto held his free hand out, a bento box full of gyoza tucked in the other. Kakashi took his hand and let Naruto swing their arms happily as he led the way back to the Hatake manor. \n\u201cI\u2019m home!\u201d Naruto bellowed as they entered the door, \u201cAnd I brought Gyoza!\u201d\nSakura and Sasuke called out greeting and Kakashi couldn\u2019t help the smile that rooted on his face as he shut the door behind him.\n.--.\n.--.\nKakashi narrowed his eyes. Across from him Genma whistled cheerfully as he looked over a bunch of seals Naruto had spread across the grass. Naruto was sitting, hands on his knees, face serious for once as he awaited the judgement. Kakashi narrowed his eyes at both of them again.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he finally said, \u201cWhy are you here Genma?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t I teach Naruto some seals?\u201d Genma asked, not even glancing up at him. \n\u201cYou are teaching him some seals. During the afternoons. Why are you here at 8am interrupting our ninjutsu and taijutsu practice?\u201d\n\u201cI just had some seals I needed to teach him that couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d Genma lied blatantly.\nKakashi glanced around suspiciously. He had dropped Sakura off with Gai and spent some time watching her progress as Sasuke and Naruto did their own morning taijutsu exercise. Or so he\u2019d thought they had been doing. Instead, he had returned to their main training ground to find Naruto sitting watching Genma go over his seals. And Sasuke was nowhere to be seen. Kakashi knew one of his ninken would be keeping an eye on the boy, as well as an ANBU most likely, but that still didn\u2019t make him any less suspicious. \nAnd then there was Genma smirking even as he refused to acknowledge Kakashi over Naruto\u2019s seals. But the biggest thing was\u2026\n\u201cHow did you get Naruto to sit so quietly,\u201d he eyed his blonde student and his odd solemn face.\n\u201cMaybe he just respects me more as a teacher,\u201d Genma drawled. \nKakashi peered at both of them.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a clone,\u201d Kakashi finally said.\n\u201cArgh,\u201d Naruto groaned relaxing, \u201cHow did you guess!?\u201d\nWhich, on a good day would be hard to do considering Shadow Clones contained so much chakra. But really, Naruto sitting still and quiet was so weird he had to be a clone or \u2026.\n\u201cNo, not a clone,\u201d Kakashi realized, \u201cA henge.\u201d\n\u201cWah! He got it so quickly!\u201d Aoba laughed, dismissing the henge.\n\u201cI told you Naruto is much more energetic than that,\u201d Genma sighed.\n\u201cEven when you\u2019re judging his work?\u201d Aoba asked surprised.\nKakashi watched the byplay with sharp narrowed eyes.\n\u201cYou\u2019re distracting me,\u201d he said slowly.\nAoba gave him a peace sign and then they both shunshin\u2019d away as Kakashi made a move towards them. Kakashi was left in the training field alone, eyes narrowed and mind going a hundred miles an hour. Sasuke and Naruto were up to something and they had roped some Genma and his friends into it. Which meant Gai was probably in on it from that end, and Sakura would know what was up with Naruto and Sasuke. He glanced behind him at the training ground Team Gai favored but knew if he went there, there would be no one there. \nWith a quick hand sign he summoned Pakkun. The pug gave Kakashi a doggy smile and wagged his tail.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in on it too!\u201d Kakashi accused at the uncharacteristically happy greeting.\n\u201cNo idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Pakkun lied through his sharp teeth. \nThen the pug vanished, dismissing himself. Kakashi leapt for the path out of the fields and took off back towards town. Something was up and it was obviously aimed at him. It was a conspiracy.\nKakashi almost made it to the village proper when he was ambushed. Only his instincts had him ducking out of the way, spinning off the path to grab a tree branch and haul himself up. A smoke bomb exploded where he had stood, all orange and purple and obviously Naruto\u2019s. But when Kakashi looked up for his wayward student he found Umino Iruka standing at the end of the path, grinning widely and fingers full of small paper wrapped bombs. \n\u201cIt really is a conspiracy,\u201d Kakashi declared.\nUmino merely grinned, eyes sparkling as if this was all he had wanted in life. Then he was spinning at Kakashi, throwing smoke bombs full of colored smoke and powder at him. The glint of wire in a tree saved him from setting off a tripwire in his hasty retreat and then Kakashi bailed out of the trees, suddenly aware they were riddled with traps. \nUmino Iruka had been renowned for his pranks in his youth, which had helped him become renowned around Konoha for his traps later on. There was a reason Kakashi had asked him to help Naruto become a budding trap master. But the thing about traps wasn\u2019t just how good the trap itself was, but how good the trap master was at driving an opponent into them. And Umino was good, very good.\nKakashi twisted and dived and switched places with a few innocent logs as he avoided flying knives and wire and seals and explosives and what the hell, water balloons filled with paint? And he almost made it past Umino, almost made it out of this death trap, when suddenly there was a pair of feet aimed to take his head off. He dropped like a stone and got a glance up at Tenzo\u2019s grinning face as the man swung around his branch and came back at him. Kakashi dodged a blow, deflected another and then had to dodge a smoke bomb again., Umino fell in line behind Tenzo and dammit they must have set this up together because Tenzo knew where every trap was. \nKakashi was thrown on the defensive and was now only evading things by a hair\u2019s width. Literally. The tips of his hair were pink at the top now from coming too close. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Kakashi declared, cracking his knuckles, \u201cNo more defense. Time to move onto the offence.\u201d\nTenzo had the decency to look worried at that declaration, but Umino just laughed. \n.--.\nKakashi slipped out of the alley carefully, a henge settling over him like an old coat. Just to be an ass he pulled out a copy of icha-icha. That would be a red flag to anyone in Konoha who he was, to everyone except his students at least. He had kicked the habit with them simply because he no longer had time in his day to wander around reading it, nor the energy to fake it when he was so focused on the three. Plus, well, kids and porn should not be together in the same area and Kakashi had tried really hard to kick the habit, bringing it out only when he knew there was no chance they would lean over his shoulder and accidentally read any. \nSo Kakashi in disguise (only for his students) wandered down the center of town. He could spot, out of the corner of his eyes, someone tailing him. As he turned a corner he let a clone peel away from him, continuing on under disguise while Kakashi himself hovered in the eaves. He covered himself in a small camouflage genjutsu to mask his scent and presence. Two seconds later Team eight came tripping around the corner.\n\u201cHe\u2019s real easy ta smell,\u201d Inuzuka Kiba grinned.\n\u201cThat is true. Why? Because Iruka-sensei\u2019s smoke bombs are very distinctive,\u201d Aburame Shino said.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Hyuuga Hinata nodded.\nThey all crept after his clone rather stealthily for genin to be honest. \n\u201cLesson one; genjutsu,\u201d he murmured.\nA few more hand signs and he watched their eyes glaze over. The clone led them around a block. And then around the same block, again and again and again. None of them noticed. Kakashi chuckled and started in the opposite direction. \n.--.\n\u201cDynamic entry!\u201d\nKakashi ducked easily, throwing out a palm to deflect the attack and idly looking towards Gai\u2019s students as they surrounded him.\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d he said, \u201cYou should consider your next moves very carefully.\u201d\n\u201cGai-sensei warned us of your hip attitude!\u201d Lee beamed, \u201cAnd Sakura warned us you like to tease! So we will not consider our next move but forge on ahead!\u201d\nKakashi slowly turned to look at the other two who had the decency to look a tad embarrassed and a tad caught. \n\u201cWhy would you be attacking me in the street, hmmm,\u201d he said, \u201cEspecially the street leading to my apartment.\u201d\n\u201cNo reason!\u201d Lee laughed nervously.\nTenten and Neji seemed to come to the conclusion they needed to distract him so they lunged forward. Kakashi let another clone peel away from him.\n\u201cSecond lesson,\u201d he smiled, \u201ctaijutsu.\u201d\nThe real Kakashi wandered off again listening to the rising sound of yelps behind him. \n.--.\nKakashi eye smiled at the kids and while Yamanaka Ino looked unafraid and stubborn, Nara Shikamaru had the decency to look worried, lazy slouch absent. Akimichi Choji took his cue from Shikamaru and carefully braced himself.\n\u201cWell, what ever will I do?\u201d Kakashi said dramatically, \u201cI seem to have run into some students in need of teaching.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need any teaching from you,\u201d Ino wrinkled her nose with a toss of her hair. \n\u201cI don\u2019t see Asuma about and I can\u2019t leave three poor genin with nothing to learn on this fine day,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cLets do Lesson number three; ninjutsu.\u201d\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Shikamaru whispered, \u201cChoji, take point!\u201d\nWhile Ino had been talking Kakashi had let the young Nara subtly catch his shadow. Now Shikamaru was making a hand sign, sweat on his forehead as he tried to hold Kakashi still while Choji advanced, fist growing in size.\nShikamaru was probably already aware that Kakashi had trained with various Nara\u2019s and their shadows both during the war and ANBU. So Kakashi didn\u2019t bother playing and simply took a step forward, his shadow writhing as Shikamaru tried to hold onto it.\n\u201cHold him Shikamaru!\u201d Ino snapped hands going up. \n\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d Shikamaru hissed, hands shaking. \nChoji lunged for a hit and Kakashi knocked him aside effortlessly. \n\u201cLet\u2019s start with water jutsu,\u201d Kakashi chirped, raising his hands.\nShikamaru saw his hand signs and blanched. \n\u201cRetreat!\u201d He roared.\nSmart kid, if a bit twitchy. The water dragon that rose from the nearby rain barrel was smaller than his combat one, and much less dense. The three kids tried to retreat but Kakashi didn\u2019t let them. The dragon knocked them all flat on their asses, drenching them. \n\u201cWater down, now, lightening,\u201d Kakashi said, hands sparking.\nThey fled and Kakashi let the sparks die down. \nWell. Where to go now? All the kids had been keeping him away from his apartment block, but Kakashi knew that was a diversion in itself. They wouldn\u2019t be so blatant about where they didn\u2019t want him. \nSo Kakashi turned on his heel.\n.--.\n\u00a0\nKakashi approached the front door of the Hatake manor and even from outside he could hear and sense people inside, including his missing students. He silently opened the front sliding door, stepping into the dark entrance. \n\u201cSurprise!\u201d \nKakashi blinked, taken aback as the confetti settled in his hair and on his clothes. Sakura, Naruto, and Sasuke all beamed at him. Well, Sakura and Naruto beamed, Sasuke just gave a small smile. They were dressed in civvies again and beaming at him, hands still extended from tossing the confetti on him. \n\u201cSurprise indeed,\u201d he said narrowing his eyes at them, \u201cConsidering I\u2019ve been trying to find you all day.\u201d\nThey didn\u2019t even look guilty, just grinned even wider at him. \n\u201cCome on, come on,\u201d Naruto said grabbing at his sleeve to tug him inside.\nSakura grabbed his other sleeve and also gave a yank. Kakashi would never admit her yank nearly pulled him right off his feet. Sasuke smirked at him, having seen it and Kakashi gave the kid a look that said \u2018you had better keep your mouth shut\u2019. The two dragged him into the hall and Sasuke followed as if to make sure Kakahsi wouldn\u2019t escape. The hall was well lit, and Kakashi heard noise as they drew closer to the living room and dining area. \nThey burst into the room and Kakashi had to blink at the number of people crammed inside of the decently sized room. In the center was a table laden in food and drinks and all around the room people waved at him. Gai was talking with Genma in a corner while his students milled. Kuernai and Asuma were tucked in their own corner and Yugao and Hayate had claimed the couch. Tenzo was sitting in the doorway leading to the courtyard, paper doors opened wide to let a breeze in. The sound of various students outside was faily loud. Umino was currently setting down a bowl of food on the table, chunin vest absent but no trace of color on him. \n\u201cAnd the man of the hour arrives,\u201d Genma laughed, breaking away from conversation with Gai.\n\u201cMy Eternal rival!\u201d Gai boomed.\n\u201cIs that my couch,\u201d Kakashi cut them off, narrowing his eyes. \nKakashi\u2019s students grinned at him, all looking mischievous and Kakashi groaned as he realized that was his indeed couch, and his coffee table. And he spotted some of his dishes on the table.\n\u201cIf I go upstairs, am I going to find one of the rooms set up as my bedroom?\u201d Kakashi asked.\n\u201cMe\u2019n\u2019Sasuke are gonna share a room,\u201d Naruto grinned, eyes crinkling shut, \u201cSo we got you in Sasuke\u2019s old room.\u201d\n\u201cBout time you moved back to this place,\u201d Genma clapped Kakashi on the shoulder.\n\u201cThese three probably shouldn\u2019t be living without adult supervision,\u201d Umino teased.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Naruto and Sakura protested. \n\u201cI helped clean your old apartment and filed the paperwork to end your rental agreement!\u201d Gai boomed, \u201cAnd the Youthful Iruka made sure it was fast-tracked! No going back now!\u201d\nHe laughed at the joke and Kakashi groaned knowing if Gai had done it, it was done. Especially if Umino had helped. \n\u201cHeard you gave our kids some lessons today,\u201d Asuma laughed when Kakashi flopped onto the couch.\n\u201cThey\u2019re pissed,\u201d Kurenai said plainly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because we went in circles for hours!\u201d Kiba howled, his sharp hearing have caught the conversation.\nHe glared in the doors at Kakashi.\n\u201cMah, I thought Kurenai\u2019s students would be better at genjutsu,\u201d he shrugged tauntingly. \n\u201cThey should be,\u201d Kurenai said flatly, \u201cLooks like we need more training.\u201d\n\u201cNoooo,\u201d Kiba whimpered.\n\u201cHe got my hair soaked!\u201d Ino threw in her two cents.\n\u201cYou should have seen when we were water walking,\u201d Sakura said, \u201cHe kept pushing me in the water on purpose. The gross scummy water.\u201d\nIno turned a curious gaze on her and soon the girls were sitting telling stories of training horrors. As everyone chatted and visited, snacking as they went, Kakashi spied Ino tentatively running his hand through Sakura\u2019s boy-cut while Sakura laughed. Good. Sakura needed more friendships outside of Team Sveven. All the kids did. Kaakshi peeked out the door to find Naruto and Kiba wrestling in laughter while all the ninken watched and howled with them. Sasuke and Shikamaru played a folded out game of Go, Choji watching and sharing chips with Hinata and Shino. Lee was talking with Genma of all people, showing his sensei\u2019s teammate something. Tenten, having sensed weapon users, cornered Kotetsu and Izuma and all three were waving arms in arguments over the best weapon. Neji was sitting with Umino for some reason, drinking tea and holding a quiet conversation.\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\nKakashi turned and smiled at Gai who was grinning but standing rather quietly, eyes searching the room.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d he asked, \u201cWhat I think? Well, I think I\u2019m home.\u201d\nTears immediately welled up in his friend\u2019s eyes and before Kakashi could move Gai embraced him in a bone-crushing hug.\n\u201cI am so happy for you my friend!\u201d he cried.\n\u201cThank you for all your help,\u201d Kakashi said earnestly over the tears.\nHe knew how much Gai had been there for him over the years even when Kakashi had been at his lowest. He\u2019d rarely received thanks for it as well. \n\u201cThank you,\u201d Kakashi repeated surrounding by friends and students and finally home.\n.--.\nKakashi held the flowers out carefully. Yugao looked at them, stone faced, for a long moment and Kakashi finally sighed and moved to the bedside table himself. He set them in the jar he\u2019d brought and fluffed them silently, looking at the bouquet Sakura had picked out for him. It apparently meant \u2018get well\u2019. \nYugao was still stone faced but she\u2019d turned back to Hayate. \n\u201cHe will live,\u201d Yugao announced lowly, \u201cBut they are not sure of his career.\u201d\n\u201cAt least he\u2019s alive,\u201d Kakashi said.\nHe looked at the amount of wires and tubes Hayate was hooked up too. If the patrols last night had been a little less on edge, a little more lax, he would have died alone on a roof. If Hayate had been a hair less quick, a hair less skilled, the wind blade that had cut him open from groin to throat would have been too deep to heal. \nLuck.\nIt came down to luck and paranoia. \nKakashi picked up the clipboard on the end of his bed, forgoing patient confidentiality to look at the results. \n\u201cThank you,\u201d Yugao said in the silence.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Kakashi asked, eyes on Hayate\u2019s pale face. \n\u201cHayate is skilled and he has not lost his edge, but training with you and watching your team made him more careful. He\u2019s been more watchful lately, of himself and others. It\u2019s been a while since he had a student.\u201d\nWhile Kakashi wasn\u2019t a true student of his, more an impromptu sparing partner who he yelled helpful hints at, Kakashi understood where she was coming from. Even when he wasn\u2019t teaching his kids, just being involved made him far more aware at home, let alone in the field. \n\u201cHayate will be fine,\u201d Kakashi said slowly, \u201cAnd it will be thanks to his own skill, and to you. I just gave him some exercise.\u201d\nShe nodded slowly, eyes still on her boyfriend.\n\u201cHe will be okay,\u201d Kakashi repeated. \nYugao nodded again but slowly her face crumbled. Kakashi reached out to hold her as he sensed his team moving in the distance. \n.--.\n\u201cSensei!\u201d Naruto shouted.\nKakashi looked up. One step out of the hospital and they were already honed in on him, his ducklings running up to him.\n\u201cWill Haya\u2026I mean will sensei be okay?\u201d Sakura asked immediately. \nKakashi raised a brow at her as she fidgeted. They were trying to keep the fact one of their best kenjutsu masters was in the hospital, attacked in his own village with very little clues to who. Keep it secret for security purposes but also because who ever had tried might still be in the village and think the deed done; they might come to finish it. \n\u201cHe will live,\u201d Kakashi said simply.\nHe saw some tension drain from their shoulders and did not say he might not wake up or that he may never be a sword master again. Kids didn\u2019t need that sort of heavy thoughts weighing them down. \n\u201cHatake,\u201d a man called out.\nKakashi looked up.\n\u201cJonin meeting,\u201d the man announced casually.\nKakashi nodded briskly knowing what that would be about. One of their own had almost been killed while on patrol last night and they didn\u2019t know who had done it. This would be a security meeting.\n\u201cGo get lunch,\u201d he told his kids, \u201cI\u2019ll find you afterwards.\u201d\nThey gave him identical curt nods and he turned to follow the messenger.\n.--.\n\u201cIbiki,\u201d Kakashi said with a respectful tilt of his head.\n\u201cHatake,\u201d Ibiki said, face like stone, \u201cThey\u2019re in room 3.\u201d\nKakashi nodded and set off down the hall. No one got in his way and Kakashi found the room easily. He pushed open the large steel door, disengaging the security seals and stepped into the room that was bare of anything at all except three hunched genin. Kakashi knew for as fact there used to be a table and set of chairs in here, but maybe they had taken his cute kid\u2019s ability to innovate into consideration. \nKakashi tilted his head and looked at his team. Sakura, Sasuke and Naruto were in a pile, hands tangled up and set looks in their eyes. Kakashi sat across from them and their solemn attitude.\n\u201cI only left you alone for two hours for a meeting, what did you do?\u201d he raised a brow.\n\u201cNuthin,\u201d Naruto said rebelliously.\n\u201cNothing doesn\u2019t get you picked up by a patrol squad and stuffed in TI waiting for a guardian to pick you up,\u201d Kakashi said, barely containing his snort. \n\u201cIt was self-defense,\u201d Sasuke grumbled. \nKakashi raised a brow.\n\u201cThey said you put a man through two walls,\u201d he said, \u201cA civilian man.\u201d\n\u201cHe deserved it,\u201d Sakura said fiercely. \n\u201cSee, that\u2019s the problem, because you haven\u2019t told anyone why,\u201d Kakashi told them, \u201cThe reason you\u2019re in here is no one has said what happened. We just have a man in the hospital.\u201d\nThey looked at the ground with identical scowls.\n\u201cI\u2019m not blaming you,\u201d Kakashi said gently, \u201cI just need to know what happened. I know you wouldn\u2019t do something like this without just cause. I need a report to get you out of here.\u201d\nThey mulled it over.\n\u201cSakura and Sasuke did nuthin, it was my fault,\u201d Naruto broke first.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Sasuke said sharply.\n\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d Sakura growled.\nThey started to squabble, voices tangling up and Kakashi waited them out, noting how Sasuke and Sakura squeezed Naruto\u2019s hands and refused to let go. \n\u201cHe called Naruto a monster!\u201d Sakura finally shouted over all of them.\n\u201cCalled him a fox-demon,\u201d Sasuke growled, low and dangerous. \n\u201cI knew he didn\u2019t like me, I should\u2019ve said we need to eat somewhere else,\u201d Naruto said, looking at Kakashi.\nKakashi looked at his cute little students, Sakura and Sasuke shooting him death glares as if trying to convey how much they disagreed with Naruto\u2019s words. \n\u201cHave you done something to him in the past,\u201d Kakashi asked lightly.\nNaruto scrunched his nose up.\n\u201cNo. Never pranked him or nuthin.\u201d \n\u201cThen just because he doesn\u2019t like you Naruto, doesn\u2019t mean he has the right to deny you service or verbally abuse you,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cHe also was not allowed to break the law like that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sakura agreed, perking up, \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t just self-defense, he was breaking the law.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026do you know what law I\u2019m talking about?\u201d Kakashi asked curiously, raising a brow.\nNaruto gave him a sheepish look, but under it was something worried. Sakura and Sasuke got stubborn mulish looks, crowding even closer to Naruto. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sakura said, jutting her chin in a way that said \u2018fight-me\u2019. \n\u201cWe\u2019re a team,\u201d Sasuke said shortly.\n\u201cYou told them then?\u201d Kakashi raised a brow at Naruto.\nNaruto hunched his shoulders up to his ears and Sakura and Sasuke shot Kakashi a cute set of glares. \n\u201cYeah. They deserved to know. Teammates don\u2019t keep big secrets like that.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Kakashi smiled, breaking some of the tension immediately with his words, \u201cAnd you do know that the law doesn\u2019t apply to you, riught Naruto?\u201d\nHe blinked at Kakashi, startled.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cNope!\u201d\nHe saw all their shoulder relax and watched them carefully. He wondered when Naruto had told them about the Kyuubi. When he\u2019d pulled them aside and whispered one of Konoha\u2019s biggest secrets in their ears. Kakashi hadn\u2019t caught any subtle tensions or fears or confusions in the past few months. Which meant either he\u2019d told them really early or they\u2019d never even reacted to the news beyond a cursory \u2018oh\u2019.\nKakashi smiled; his students were just the cutest.\n\u201cWell, that explains everything,\u201d Kakashi clapped his hands, \u201cLets go, we\u2019re already behind on training for the day.\u201d\nHis students scrambled to their feet behind him and Kakashi held the door open for them. Sakura\u2019s latched onto his hand as they exited and Kakahsi smield at the little trailing of ducklings they looked like, all connected by clasped hands. The TI crew must have thought it just as cute as him as they watched them all wander off.\n\u201cKakashi,\u201d Ibiki growled, eyeing his ducklings.\n\u201cAll settled,\u201d Kakashi said cheerfully. \n\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2026\u201d Ibiki sighed, a subtle sign of defeat, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll need an incident report by tonight.\u201d\n\u201cThis will be the perfect chance to teach you guys how to fill one of those out,\u201d Kakashi told his kids, accepting the papers, \u201cYou will need to know how to do that I\u2019m thinking.\u201d\nIbiki made a pained face at that thought while his kids nodded obediently. \n.--.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Kakashi said looking down at his kids, \u201cOne week left until the final stage of the chunin exams.\u201d\nNaruto pumped his fist into the air in excitement. \n\u201cYou will need a few rest days until then. Kurenai and Asuma have requested another sparing day with their students so we\u2019ll move that from the Friday to the Wednesday. Since the exam is on Saturday you will have all of Friday for a rest day; light exercise only. Thursday will be prep day, we\u2019ll go over your strategies. We went to the armory last week and you have your armor all in order so we should be good. That leaves us with tomorrow, Monday, and Tuesday. Usually Sunday would be rest day but would you prefer to do some training?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d they chorused without hesitation. \n\u201cMah, so cute. Well, what shall we focus on for the next few days?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to do more earth-nature chakra practice,\u201d Sakura piped up, \u201cAnd maybe some genjutsu.\u201d\n\u201cSame,\u201d Sasuke said, \u201cI\u2019d like to do some more ninjutsu in there.\u201d\n\u201cYeah! Lets lay of taijutsu for a bit,\u201d Naruto said, \u201cCan we learn some cool jutsu!?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Kakashi drawled, \u201cI suppose you have earned a cool jutsu. We\u2019ll do ninjutsu tomorrow then and focus on your nature chakra for the next few days. We\u2019ll keep some light exercise in their too, no point in letting your taijutsu slip.\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t slip in a few days,\u201d Naruto whined. \n\u201cI\u2019d like to keep training with Gai-sensei and the team in the mornings,\u201d Sakura said, \u201cIf that\u2019s okay?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s no problem. We don\u2019t have to completely deviate from our schedule, I just wanted to make sure you are getting the training you think you need,\u201d Kakashi said.\n\u201cThank you!\u201d Sakura chirped. \nThe rice cooker in the kitchen beeped and Naruto went off to check on dinner as Kakashi penciled a few things into the scroll in front of him.\n\u201cLet\u2019s do some seal practice tonight,\u201d he decided, \u201cDinner, report for Ibiki, and then seal work.\u201d\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Sakura nodded, \u201cNaruto, want a hand?\u201d\nShe went into the kitchen after the blond and Sasuke followed after a minute to get dishes ready. Kakashi smiled after all of them and set about setting up a lesson plan for the seals tonight. Naruto was leagues above the other two but he still had a few things to teach the boy.\n.--.\n.--.\nSunday bloomed beautiful and sunny and it was nice and quiet as Kakashi carefully went over their ninjutsu repertoire. A genin found him early with a message that made Kakashi sigh. Their training that morning was kept very light and easy so he didn\u2019t wear his students out. \nAs the morning faded into the afternoon that they moved to a pretty little open training ground on the west side of the village. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Sakura asked, eyes narrowed suspiciously at the sidelines of the field.\nThe Hokage gave a cheerful wave, pipe tucked in his teeth and hat shading him from the sun as he sat on a rock. Umino stood beside him, attentive but friendly with a suspicious clipboard in hand. \n\u201cMah, they are just on a break,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cHokage-sama said this was such a nice sunny spot to relax for a few minutes. He promised not to get in our way.\u201d\nNaruto who was waving enthusiastically back at the two offered Kakashi a wide grin.\n\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d the blond beamed, \u201cIruka-sensei has his clipboard.\u201d\n\u201cTHE clipboard?\u201d Sasuke asked, peering across the distance.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sakura said solemnly.\n\u201cOh? Is there something special about his clipboard?\u201d Kakashi asked, curious.\n\u201cIt means he\u2019s gonna be all judgey,\u201d Naruto said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s his real marks clipboard,\u201d Sakura further explained, \u201cHe only used it for activities he said we weren\u2019t getting graded on, but we all knew they were really important.\u201d\n\u201cIt has the little sticker,\u201d Sasuke grumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s how you tell.\u201d\nKakashi squinted at them, but from this distance he could only make out a blob of color on the back of the clipboard. It could have been a sticker he guessed. \n\u201cWell,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cI guess that means our practice has to be extra intense.\u201d\nThey all groaned subtlety.\n\u201cNow, what shall we do?\u201d Kakashi tapped his chin as if thoughtful, \u201cMaybe some genjutsu matches? No that\u2019s too boring for the audience. Some trap displays? Hmm, no that usually ends up covering the whole field in smoke. How about\u2026sparring!\u201d \nThey looked at him like he was a wild animal, huddling closer together during his little drama act. When he beamed cheerfully at them they shuddered.\n\u201cLet\u2019s do some team sparring,\u201d Kakashi nodded, \u201cYou three against me.\u201d\n\u201cWe do that all the time,\u201d Naruto said suspiciously, like there was a trap too it.\n\u201cWell, lets make it interesting then. No limits,\u201d Kakashi declared with a sly smile, \u201cGenjutsu, taijutsus, ninjutsu, traps, anything you want.\u201d\nThey looked at one another in surprise, then their eyes darted to Umino and the Hokage. But especially to the clipboard. Such smart little students. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the goal?\u201d Sasuke grunted, feet subtly bracing.\n\u201cTake down,\u201d Kakashi smiled. \u201cFight until either I, or all of you, are incapacitated.\u201d\nThey winced again, knowing how many bruises that was going to mean. But there was glitter in their eyes, something like excitement.\n\u201cDo we get time to plan?\u201d Sakura asked.\nSometimes if he was feeling generous he gave them a moment to strategize.\n\u201cNope! Begin!\u201d\nThey blinked in bewilderment but were far too used to him. They scattered, a bloom of clones rising to distract him as they retreated to a more strategic point. Kakashi smiled after them. Near the edge of the field three clones peeled off of Umino and set off to tale the students. They would sense it but he was sure they would be smart enough to ignore clones that definitely weren\u2019t Kakashi\u2019s. \n.--. \nSakura looked like...well she looked like Sakura, all short pink hair and fiery green eyes. Her knuckles dusters gleamed in the light and she had that set look on her face he knew meant he would have to put her down hard to keep her down. \n\u201cMah, you look so fierce,\u201d Kakashi smiled. \nHer nose twitched and her eyes narrowed as she slid more firmly into the opening stance of the Iron Fist Style. \n\u201cDo you even need the knuckle dusters anymore?\u201d he smiled as he slid his feet apart.\nShe didn\u2019t answer, merely threw herself at him. He dodged the throw by a hair\u2019s width, with minimal movement, efficiently moving just out of the way. Sakura came at him immediately again, already recovering from the miss and throwing her heel up at his stomach. \nAnd so their dance began: Kakashi dodging by a hair\u2019s width every time and Sakura keeping her moves tightly controlled so she didn\u2019t over extend with each miss. They stuck close, up and personal and Kakashi had to use his open palm to deflect a few elbow throws. Her hits, which were hard could not be caught safety anymore. And she\u2019d gotten better at her efficiency, even her openings were more dangerous to go after in fear of retaliation. Kakashi knew he could easily end up with broken bones here. \n\u201cAim for the vitals,\u201d Kakashi reminded, \u201cAnd where it hurts.\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d Sakura growled.\n\u201cThat blow would have glanced off my ribs, maybe inconvenient but no real harm,\u201d Kakashi corrected.\n\u201cIt would have broke them,\u201d Sakura said with a hint of teeth.\nJust to check he deflected one of her blows towards the ground and watched the stone crater beneath her. \n\u201cGood,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cYou\u2019re getting better at that.\u201d\nSakura had amazing chakra control, just luck of her birth, and it had taken her a while to realize she was unconsciously using it in her hits let alone could do that purposefully. The technicalities of Tsunade\u2019s super strength wasn\u2019t really a secret inside of Konoha for the fact that no one else had had the control or will to master it. Most shinobi used chakra to augment their muscles but no one had the control necessary to release it from those muscles in a split second with focus. But Sakura, well, Kakashi thought Sakura had a good chance.\nSakura came at his face with a vicious uppercut that clipped his jaw just the slightest. He felt the bruise blooming immediately as he lunged back. \nKakashi ducked, barely clearing Naruto\u2019s leg, and then rolled out of the way of the scythe point that followed him. Naruto was a whirlwind of color and attacks and noise as he gave little war cries. If not for how scary unpredictable he was, Kakashi would have tutted him for so much noise and color, but that was a part of the unpredictable Uzumaki Naruto style. He got up in his opponents face and there was no escaping him in any way, senses or otherwise. \nA clone spun in, wind spinning with him to kick up dust and half blind Kakashi. Kakashi lunged out of the way, blinking dust away and dodged a punch from Sakura. The chain that came for his throat behind the bunch drove him straight into a wall of fire. If not for a quick substitute he would have burned like the log now in his place. As it was his flak jacket smoked faintly. \nSakura and Naruto came at him again, perfectly in tandem, not getting tripped up in either one\u2019s movement. Sasuke used Sakura as a spring board mid fight and came at Kakashi from above. \nKakashi nearly decapitated himself by dodging straight into a wall of ninja wire. It was only his own quick wits and flexibility that got him through Naruto\u2019s masterful web of ninja wire. Well, mostly through, he winced at the beading of blood on his now exposed arm, sleeve chopped straight off. \nWhen he said spider web he meant spider web. The wire was not just meant to cut but to capture and one loop had gotten about his arm and started tightening before he\u2019d gotten out. Wire that sharp could take off a limb if not careful. \nKakashi looked for his students and found them vanished. He twitched his nose, stretched his senses and\u2026aw, there.\nHe dodged Naruto by a hair\u2019s width as the boy and his clones came upon him like a whirlwind. Kakashi stumbled. Once, twice, dismissed the genjutsu and regained his balance to throw two clones straight into their own wire trap. But\u2026oh! Sasuke lit the while wire contraption on fire, fire chakra racing down the lines. Kakashi realized he was a half a step into the web and retreated. Or tried to.\nHands of earth rose up and clamped on his legs, as hard and unyielding as stone Sakura followed her jutsus, hammer slipping out of the earth like it was water and a mad grin on her face. \nFire coming around him, earth holding him still, a hammer coming for his face from below, and ah, a wind clone coming at him from above with a scythe. Oh and look there, Sasuke coming in from an angle with his satsuma. \nKakashi charged his whole body with lightening. The earth fragmented and shattered. He reached up and grasped the clone, spinning them to switch places and hurling said clone at the hammer blow coming for his face, as he threw himself into the air, clear of the fire and Sasuke\u2019s attack.\nHe admitted to being impressed as Sakura redirected her blow mid swing and let the clone grab the hammer instead of smashing onto it. She twirled and the clone took all the momentum from the hammer before being thrown straight back up. Sasuke used the clone as a spring board to come hurtling up at the retreating Kakashi. Sakura then dove back into the earth like it was a pool and not solid ground as the fire consumed the space they had been standing. \nKakashi kicked Sasuke off into a tree as he was falling back to safe ground started to really strategize. The kids had kept him on his toes long enough to stop him from really considering a plan of action.\nAnd, ah, there on the ground he was aiming at was a spike trap. Lovely.\n.--.\nThe medic asked no questions as she patched his team up. Naruto whined under her hands but she said nothing, merely snapped his dislocated shoulder back into place and healed his broken collar bone. The array of bruises and cuts on his body were already healing. Sasuke, suffering harsh lightening burns up both arms and his chest and a twisted ankle didn\u2019t make any noise, but his pained face said enough for him. Sakura, with two broken wrists, a couple broken ribs, and a concussion, laughed at them and called them pansies from where she lay in the cracked earth. \nWhen the medic got to Kakashi himself he smiled a faint hello and watched the way she handled his broken femur. He was quite sure she\u2019d survived in ANBU with him many, many years ago. He said nothing of this too her and she didn\u2019t acknowledge him as she healed an injury that should have still required a cast even with chakra-healing, within twenty minutes. Kakashi was impressed, not just for her skill, but that the Hokage had asked them to be fully patched up. Well, not that surprised he supposed. He\u2019d asked for an all-out battle and had to be responsible for what happened during it. \n\u201cSakura is the frontline fighter, the heavy hitter,\u201d Umnio muttered looking at his clipboard as if he couldn\u2019t understand it.\n\u201cShe broke my femur with one hit,\u201d Kakashi grinned at the man, \u201cHardest bone in the body and snap.\u201d\n\u201cI pegged her as a genjutsu specialist or medic,\u201d Umino said faintly, \u201cBack in the academy.\u201d\nKakashi heard the unspoken \u2018I\u2019m barely wrong\u2019. Which was true. Umino was a fantastic profiler, especially for the academy students. He was the one who organized the teams every year, making sure those who truly would succeed were paired with students of like motivation and skill. There was a reason little civilian raised Haruno Sakura was on a team with the last Uchiha and the Kyuubi Jinchuriki. \n\u201cSkill wise I would have thought the same,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cAt first. But her personality is too strong for a supporting role. She\u2019s got a temper and a viciousness to her that matches her brute strength. \n\u201cI still hadn\u2019t had her pegged a taijutsu master,\u201d Umino chuckled, \u201cOh well, I have to be wrong sometimes I suppose. I\u2019m glad you figured out her skill set.\u201d\nKakashi nodded watching as Naruto chatted with the Hokage excitedly, Sakura at his side, sunbathing. Sasuke had slipped off a few minutes\u2019 prior after a few words from the Hokage and Kakashi only faintly wondered where he was off too.\n\u201cAnd Naruto,\u201d Umino smiled, smile bright and happy, \u201cHe\u2019s done so well with his clones. And the way he\u2019s using his wind nature\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a force of nature,\u201d Kakashi agreed, \u201cThanks to you too, sensei. His traps have gained an edge they never had before.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of him,\u201d Umino smiled, \u201cOf all of them. But can you tell me if there is a reason Sasuke keeps using fire instead of his lightening nature chakra?\u201d\nKakashi gave him a sly grin.\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t realized his nature isn\u2019t fire but lightening yet.\n\u201cAnd a certain sensei hasn\u2019t seen fit to correct him?\u201d Umino raised a brow, lips twitching into a grin.\n\u201cMah, I have to let the kids learn some things on their own,\u201d he beamed. \nUmino laughed loud enough to make the kids look over at him. And oh, there was Sasuke carrying a large stack of bentos.\n\u201cKakashi-sensei! Iruka-sensei! Jiji got us lunch!\u201d Naruto hollered. \nNaruto was already opening the bento\u2019s by the time Umino and him wandered over. The Hokage smiled at him as the kids started to squabble over something.\n\u201cThat was a good showing,\u201d the Hokage smiled at him, \u201cI\u2019d say it was almost a draw.\u201d\n\u201cMah, I was the last man standing,\u201d Kakashi said lightly.\n\u201cWith a broken femur and more than a few minor injuries,\u201d the Hokage remarked, \u201cFor a team of genin to challenge someone like yourself and manage so well\u2026\u201d\nKakashi heard what went unsaid. Yes, some of it could be contributed to familiarity with his fighting, but that was a double-edged sword. They knew his fighting style, but he had taught them theirs and they had still used it well against him. And Kakashi knew, despite his title as jonin, he was not the average jonin. He\u2019d been an ANBU commander and retired due to politics and mental well-being, not lack of skill or injury. Kakashi was listed as an S-rank ninja in the bingo book and he\u2019d earned that rank. He wondered idly, as he got offered a bento from Sakura, what this team could do against a regular jonin.\nThey could probably bring one down easily if they worked together. He smiled, vicious and proud.\n.--.\n\u201cGai, it\u2019s six am,\u201d Kakashi groaned.\nThis was becoming a disturbing pattern; getting woken up early by others. \nGai grinned at him from the edge of the bed where he had seated himself.\n\u201cI have Lee waking Naruto and Sasuke! Sakura was already in the kitchen making tea so Tenten and Neji have joined her. You will be the last to wake, rival!\u201d\nKakashi groaned and half fell out of the bed. He was feeling the strain of their spar yesterday and it did make him smile. Gai held out his shirt and Kakashi took it, dragging it over his head.\n\u201cA nice array of bruises,\u201d Gai said, a tad quieter, eyeing Kakashi carefully, \u201cA fight?\u201d\n\u201cSparred with the kids all out yesterday,\u201d Kakashi smiled at him, \u201cThey did good.\u201d\nGai brightened and clasped his shoulder before disappearing down the hall as Kakashi dug socks out from under his bed. Kakashi dragged himself into the kitchen to find Naruto making breakfast with his eyes closed, looking to be asleep even as he held a frying pan. Sasuke was beside him looking quite grumpy. Sakura meanwhile was sitting at the table with Tenten looking fresh and happy. Kakashi hated morning people; how did they have the energy?\n\u201cWhy are we awake so early, Kakashi-sensei,\u201d Naruto groaned, without opening his eyes. \n\u201cIts only an hour earlier than we usually wake,\u201d Sakura pointed out.\nSasuke gave a grunt that could have been a \u2018fuck you\u2019. \n\u201cBut I\u2019m sore,\u201d Naruto groaned, \u201cI thought sensei would be super nice and let us sleep in after yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cNo rest for my cute little students,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cNot with the exam so close.\u201d\nThey all groaned as Team Gai watched them with looks of mild confusion. Sakura and Naruto had food laid out promptly, squeezing in extra sets for the other team and everyone dug in with enthusiasm. Kakashi took his food to the veranda with Gai as the kids took up the whole table. \n\u201cI\u2019m stealing your students for the morning, my rival!\u201d Gai announced around mouthfuls of rice, \u201cI heard about your spars with the younger teams last week and my team could use similar experience!\u201d\n\u201cSounds good,\u201d Kakashi said.\nAfter breakfast Sasuke and Lee cleaned up, Lee cheerfully, and Sasuke with accepted sullenness at being forced to endure the other boy\u2019s cheerfulness at full volume so early.\n\u201cHave fun!\u201d Kakashi waved off the kids as they all piled out the door.\nSakura gave him an enthusiastic wave already hoping foot to foot while Naruto and Sasuke sent him identical death glares. He\u2019d owe them that cool jutsu this afternoon for putting up with Team Gai. Then Gai was dragging them off shouting about youth. \n\u201cNow, what did you rope Gai into distracting my kids for?\u201d Kakashi asked the garden, \u201cIf you wanted to get me alone all you had to do was ask, Genma.\u201d\nGenma rolled his eyes as he slipped out of the shadows. \n\u201cI did ask. I asked Gai.\u201d\nKakashi laughed and invited him in silently. Genma followed him into the house, toeing his sandals off and following Kakashi to the dining room. Kakashi fetched the tea Sakura had helpfully left for him and poured the man a cup.\n\u201cWhat do you need help with?\u201d Kakashi asked.\n\u201cWho says I need help?\u201d\nKakashi raised a brow at him and Genma sighed pulling out a scroll. He unrolled it across the table and Kakashi leaned over to see a seal layout.\n\u201cThe barrier seals?\u201d Kakashi asked, tilting his head.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to buffer them up, make them stronger. Standard maintenance, of course.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Kakashi echoed, \u201cI take it you went to Jiraya already.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Asked the kids to look over them yesterday too just for study at least. We\u2019re just covering all bases and I know you\u2019re better at offensive sealing.\u201d\nKakashi nodded faintly. Kushina hadn\u2019t had time to teach him a lot but she had taught him some, and Minato had also given him lessons, and both had used seals for offence more often than defense. But you know what they say, the best defense is a good offence.\nKakashi also idly thought of Hayate injured and alone, bleeding out on their own soil.\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look.\u201d\n.--.\n.--.\n\u201cSo how was playing with Gai\u2019s team this morning?\u201d Kakashi asked.\nSasuke and Naruto gave twin groans of pain while Sakura hopped around them with excitement, babbling how she and Lee had had one of their best spars yet. She sparred against an invisible opponent and told him all about how she\u2019d finally gotten the Lotus Blooms Again down. Kakashi was quite glad that Lee and Sakura were getting along well. The first few days of their training had required close eyes and Gai pulling Lee aside to talk about professionalism and leaving girls who said \u2018no thanks\u2019 alone. Luckily Lee really was a good kid at heart and he had accepted the dressing down and promptly and wholeheartedly apologized to Sakura. They were apparently Eternal Rivals now, emulating their sensei. And some part of Kakashi was genuinely touched. \n\u201cSorry I sent you off with him after we said ninjutsu focus,\u201d Kakashi laughed at the boys, \u201cI promise you all an awesome jutsu that aligns with your nature chakra for being such good sports.\u201d\nNaruto at least cheered up visibly at that, dragging himself upright. Sasuke followed him and Sakura stopped her story telling to focus.\n\u201cNinjutsu and nature manipulation focus for the next few days then,\u201d Kakashi clapped his hands as his students gathered around him, \u201cFirst off, Sasuke, I have so good news and some bad news for you.\u201d\nSasuke stared at him, twitching slightly as if worried but also suspicious. \n\u201cThe good news is you are doing amazing with your fire-chakra manipulation.\u201d\nThe hint of a blush on his cheeks told Kakashi how happy the boy was with his praise.\n\u201cThe bad news,\u201d Kakashi said, reaching out to place a comforting hand on his shoulder, \u201cIs that your natural affinity isn\u2019t fire, it\u2019s lightening.\u201d\nThere was a moment of stillness as Sasuke\u2019s brain seemed to try and comprehend this information, and then reboot. Sakura and Naruto watched from the side, eyes darting between them like this was an intense match. Kakashi tried to keep his face poker straight but felt a smile already curling his eye. \n\u201cWhat.\u201d Sasuke said flatly.\n\u201cYour affinity is lightening, which is why you\u2019ve been having a hard time with fire. In fact I would have said you wouldn\u2019t have been able to grasp manipulation of a secondary nature this early if not for your background and constant use of fire chakra already. But you\u2019ve been fighting an uphill battle. You would have been much better to double check your infinity.\u201d\nKakashi held out a square of paper to prove it and as Sasuke took it slowly, pumping chakra, watching it crumple. Sasuke\u2019s eye started twitching.\n\u201cWHAT!?!?!?!\u201d\nNaruto was still a heap of giggles ten minute later as Kakashi showed Sasuke how to focus his lightening natured chakra. Kakashi showed him the signs for a simple sparking jutsu and Sasuke watched him with a deep glower, pointedly ignoring the puddle that was a giggling Naruto and the way Sakura was physically holding her hands over her mouth to stop her own giggles. \nWhen the lightening sparked to life instantly, Sasuke\u2019s eye finally stopped twitching and his sulk fell into a thoughtful expression. He looked at the arcs of electricity dancing across his hand and when he looked up at Kakashi\u2019s encouraging look, he gave the hint of a smile. \n.--.\n\u201cYour students are terrifying,\u201d Genma muttered.\n\u201cMah, thanks for the compliment,\u201d Kakashi smiled. \n\u201cI\u2019m not sure he meant that nicely,\u201d Umino remarked.\nIn the distance, standing in the center of the field, Sasuke\u2019s whole body sparked with blue lightening. It was one of the first steps to the chidori but Sasuke was focusing more on how to manipulate the flow than concentrate it into an attack. Didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t dangerous though. Naruto yelped and then burst into smoke after getting to close, the clone vanishing. \nKakashi eyed the clipboard in Umino\u2019s hands. There was a flower sticker on the back, a blooming sunflower that was worn and scratched. He was taking copious notes looking serious as he did so.\nBut his eyes weren\u2019t on Team seven, instead they were on Kakashi.\n\u201cWatch it,\u201d Genma told him.\nKakashi looked down at the weeping brush and moved it before it ruined the seal. They were pretty much just mass producing a bunch of connector seals to help strengthen the barriers on the wall. Not hard if you knew what you were doing, but tedious for the amount needed. \n\u201cI need more paper, Genma-sensei!\u201d Tenten called.\nThey\u2019d roped Tenten, Naruto, and some chunin kid Genma was apparently teaching on the side to help as well. The kids sat in a neat circle chit chatting as they did the connector seals while the adults hovered off to the side. \nGenma stood to give the kids more supplies as Naruto absently made a handful of more clones to go train with Sasuke and Sakura. They could have had a bunch of clones making seals but they didn\u2019t have the chakra focus to be doing grunt work like that. Clones were handy but not perfect and often were more absent minded (getting distracted more easily if given boring tasks) than the original and less able to focus their chakra which led to chakra waste. \nUmino, used to using seals in his work as well, had been roped into helping. Or maybe he\u2019d volunteered. Every once in a while he put down the sealing brush to make notes with only a few scrutinizing glances up at Kakashi. \n\u201cHow did you get them so focused?\u201d Genma asked as he returned, \u201cI can barely get my one kid to focus on the tasks I assign.\u201d\nKakashi looked between him and Umino feeling like this was less friendly conversation and more like he was navigating a mine field. \n\u201cYou have to treat them like puppies. Make sure to be stern but also be ready to give out treats,\u201d Kakashi remarked carefully.\nMore notes on the clipboard. \n\u201cI brought snacks!\u201d\nKakashi looked up to find an eager Naruto clone holding a couple bags from the corner store.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best!\u201d Tenten cheered. \nKakashi smiled fondly as Naruto started distributing snacks to everyone. When he dropped a bottle of tea off with Kakashi he carefully slipped Kakashi\u2019s wallet back into his pocket. Kakashi looked up to find Umino watching with a smirk.\n\u201cGetting soft?\u201d he teased.\n\u201cMah,\u201d Kakashi rubbed the back of his head sheepishly, \u201cGot to keep them fed, just like with puppies.\u201d\n\u201cI got you your favorite!\u201d Naruto declared to Kakashi, holding out two rice balls.\n\u201cThank you, I\u2019ll eat them in a bit,\u201d Kakashi told him.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten since breakfast!\u201d Naruto protested, cheeks puffing out, \u201cYou gotta eat to stay strong!\u201d \n\u201cGive it up kid,\u201d Genma laughed, \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to see under his mask, almost every jonin in the village has tried offering him food to do so.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Naruto peered at Genma with confusion, \u201cWhy would I give him food to take his mask off?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not even a little curious?\u201d Genma teased.\nNaruto stared at him, bewildered, then darted a glance at Kakashi who\u2019s smile was turning into a smirk. \n\u201cCurious about what?\u201d Naruto asked, scratching his head.\n\u201cAbout what your sensei\u2019s face looks like,\u201d Genma said, starting to look as confused as Naruto.\n\u201cBut I already know what sensei\u2019s face looks like,\u201d Naruto scrunched up his nose.\nThere was a long, long moment of silence.\n\u201cWhat.\u201d Genma said flatly.\n\u201cSakura, Sasuke,\u201d Umino called, voice just as flat, \u201cDo you know what your sensei\u2019s face looks like?\u201d\nThe two who had broke off their sparring to eat their own snacks looked up, faces scrunched in almost the same way Naruto\u2019s had.\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Sakura said, as if saying \u2018duh\u2019, \u201cWe eat together every day, you can\u2019t eat with a mask on.\u201d\n\u201cNot like he wears it all the time,\u201d Sasuke added with a snort.\nThe two turned back to their snacks and Naruto looked between the adults before shrugging and dropping beside Tenten to get back to seals. Kakashi grinned at the two men giving him the deadliest glares he\u2019d seen on them.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve seen you face,\u201d Genma flatly.\n\u201cAs Sasuke said, I don\u2019t wear my mask all the time,\u201d Kakashi chirped. \n\u201cI have worked with you for nearly seventeen years,\u201d Genma said, voice rising, \u201cAnd not once have I seen it!\u201d\n\u201cNaruto,\u201d Umino said sweetly, \u201cCan you tell me what your sensei\u2019s face looks like?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? It looks like Kakashi,\u201d Naruto said looking at Umino as if to ask if he was okay.\nKakashi nearly cackled as he saw Umino visibly deflate at the answer. \n\u201cHey Sakura!\u201d Genma waved, \u201cWhat does this bastard\u2019s face look like?\u201d\nSakura looked between Kakashi\u2019s grin and Genma\u2019s twitching eye and clammed up.\n\u201cNone of your business,\u201d she sniffed, turning her back to him.\nKakashi really did cackle as Genma gave a noise like a balloon losing air. \n.--.\n\u201cYo,\u201d Kakashi greeted, \u201cHow are feeling?\u201d\n\u201cLike I lost a fight with a wind blade,\u201d Hayate smiled, a tad strained.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it lost,\u201d Kakashi said as he took a seat beside the hospital bed, \u201cYou\u2019re still alive after all.\u201d\nHayate gave a coughing raspy laugh.\n\u201cMy students send their regards,\u201d Kakashi said holding out a bouquet of flowers that had a little signed car with well wishes in various hands. \n\u201cTell them thank you,\u201d Hayate said, smiling faintly as he took the lowers, thumbing the card. \nKakashi gave him a moment and helped him arrange the flowers at his bedside. \n\u201cCan you tell me who it was?\u201d Kakashi asked, tone harmless and idle.\nHayate looked at him.\n\u201cOr is it classified?\u201d Kakashi asked easily, holding up his hands to show he would accept that information.\nHayate watched him, eyes sharp for all he looked exhausted and wounded. \n\u201cI can tell you,\u201d Hayate finally said, \u201cIt was a sand jonin. He was trying to reassure another sand-nin about the\u2026you-know-what. The second guy looked like he was a nervous wreck and was babbling more than he should have in the open and I overheard. Just my luck that the Sand Jonin had good senses. He came after me and I didn\u2019t realize he was even wielding a wind blade until it got me. The nervous wreck came to check if I was dead but the idiot actually tried to find my pulse instead of double tapping me. And then he fucked up and didn\u2019t actually find my pulse; so when I held my breath he declared me dead and they both fled. I\u2019m lucky the jonin wasn\u2019t the one to check.\u201d\nHayate coughed lightly, a raspy laugh behind it.\n\u201cLuck,\u201d he said ruefully, \u201cIs what kept me alive.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t discount luck,\u201d Kakashi said lightly as he parsed the information, \u201cI\u2019ll be thankful to luck as long as it brings my comrades home alive.\u201d\nThe door opened carefully and Yuugao slipped in looking freshly showered, if still exhausted.\n\u201cMah, you should have taken time to eat as well,\u201d Kakashi scolded her lightly, \u201cI promised I\u2019d keep an eye on him.\u201d\nShe paused but shook her head holding up a bento he knew was from the cafeteria, which ew, and then took Kakashi\u2019s place in the chair. Her hand immediately found Hayate\u2019s and Kakashi smiled fondly as they both looked at each other softly. He closed the door quietly behind him as he set off to find his team. He\u2019d left them shadowing an annoyed nurse and he could only hope the nurse hadn\u2019t snapped and left them locked in a closet somewhere. \n.--.\nKakashi watched as Sakura made rapid hand signs, her lips pressed tight together. When she slammed her hands into the ground he was impressed by the thickness of the wall that leapt over her in a partial protective dome. \n\u201cUgh!\u201d Sakura complained, \u201cI can\u2019t get it to go completely over me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get it,\u201d he assured her, saying nothing of how advanced it already was for a silent jutsu.\nWhile jutsus didn\u2019t truly require the technique to be shouted out loud, just like it didn\u2019t truly need all the hand signs and you could cut it down to half signs, it was all about focus. Shouting the technique helped center a ninja and their attention which helped focus their chakra. It was a little psychological trick that was needed before you had mastered the jutsu. But Sakura was starting nearly completely without words. She had the focus and control all ready and didn\u2019t see the need to shout out her jutsu names. Which was good, but was also highly unusual for such a young shinobi who didn\u2019t have a lot of ninjutsu experience. She really was very good.\nNaruto on the other hand\u2026\nThere was a shout, and then a water dragon completely obliterated a rock. \nWell, Naruto would never have the pinpoint control Sakura did but he was doing very well for how much chakra he had in his body. Most jonin would struggle for control to water-walk if they had that much heavy chakra weighing them down, but Naruto didn\u2019t even have to focus to walk across water now and that was amazing. Kakashi remembered how it had only taken him a few days to master water-walking as well. He\u2019d learned it nearly as quick as Sasuke and Sasuke had a thimble of chakra compared to the ocean of Naruto and the Kyuubi. \nNaruto\u2019s problem was the focus not the control. If he wanted to he could narrow all his senses down to one task, but he just didn\u2019t often care too. Naruto liked to know everything happening around him and often let himself be distracted by things around him. Which was good for awareness and a trap master, but a little less good when trying to narrowly master one jutsu. \n\u201cKakashi did you see my water dragon! It was a s big as my fire one!\u201d\n\u201cGood job,\u201d Kakashi said with a smile, \u201cNow try to do it without screaming out the technique name.\u201d\nNaruto grinned and went back to practicing. Kakashi watched him a long moment. Naruto had liked the fire jutsu he\u2019d taught them because he liked explosions, but also because he could tag team with Sasuke with them. But as soon as Sasuke had started mastering lightening, suddenly Naruto was interested in water. A water dragon to drench his enemies before Sasuke came in sparking. Sasuke had been the same, mastering fire jutsus that worked well with wind as soon as Naruto got a grasp on his nature chakra. \nHa. His kids were just such good kids. Working together to help strengthen their teammates with no words exchanged. \n.--.\n\u201cWatch me,\u201d Kakashi commanded.\nSasuke peered closer.\n\u201cWith the sharingan,\u201d Kakashi said.\nSasuke narrowed his eyes at him for a long moment and then mulishly activated the sharingan, eyes burning scarlet. Kakashi nodded once and then carefully found his center and started to charge his body with electricity. \n\u201cThe reason Chidori can\u2019t be copied,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cIs because it\u2019s not strictly a jutsu. It\u2019s pure nature manipulation.\u201d\nKakashi slowly focused his lightening chakra to focus just on his palm until he was holding a wild chirping ball of blue lightening just waiting to be used. The air around them charged with it, hair rising with the force and focus of it. What killed people wasn\u2019t just the attack going through them, though punching a hole through people didn\u2019t help, it was the electricity that killed them, hundreds of volts discharging through their body. \n\u201cNow you try, but be careful, you already know you risk electrical burns and you need to stay in top shape for the finals.\u201d\nSasuke nodded seriously and slowly started to form his own nature chakra. He\u2019d already learned how to charge his whole body which was prodigious considering they\u2019d been working on this less than a month. Under Kakashi\u2019s careful watch Sasuke a blue condensed ball of lightening started to waver in his hand.\n\u201cStop,\u201d Kakashi demanded when his control fluctuated.\nSasuke carefully discharged the electricity and slumped, panting. \n\u201cLightening takes careful, focused handing and a healthy dose of caution,\u201d Kakashi told him, \u201cBut it\u2019s also a wild thing, it can\u2019t be smoothed. Chidori is condensing it but letting it keep its edge. If you try to smooth it over like you did it\u2019s more likely to backfire. Don\u2019t try to make a sphere of it, just let it condense and take whatever shape it wants.\u201d\nSasuke nodded and tried again.\nA clearing away a clone was watching just as carefully as he helped Naruto try and focus wind chakra on the end of his scythe. He was getting it scary fast but having difficulty releasing it into a thrown blade instead of just coating edges to make them sharper. A way away from that a Kakashi clone sat meditating with Sakura as he watched her stretch her awareness and chakra deep into the earth. She\u2019d mastered swimming through the earth like it was water, and making the earth form in small spaces, such as to use like hands, but she was having difficulty making anything larger than small walls. \nThe real Kakashi, sitting next to Sasuke and the far more volatile lightening nature manipulation smiled to himself. \nGenius\u2019 all of them. Sasuke had been recognized as thus back in the academy but no one had considered Naruto anything more than a fool despite contrary evidence in his traps and endurance. And Sakura had similarly been ignored for her book knowledge, disregarding how hard she had hit in taijutsu practice and how quickly she picked everything up despite lacking training outside of school. \nWell. Their loss and Kakashi\u2019s gain. He quite liked his three smart little students.\n.--.\n\u201cSo we meet again,\u201d Kakashi smiled at the kids before him.\nMost gave him a sort of stubborn mulish look, baby-fat cheeks puffing out and eyes squinting in glares. Kakashi looked up at Kurenai and Asuma and judging by their grins they found it just as cute and amusing to see their students glowering at him. \n\u201cHave you been training hard?\u2019 he asked innocently, \u201cHave you worked on some strategies?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going kick their asses,\u201d Ino declared, shooting a look at Team Seven who grinned back.\nThis time his cute little students had forwent the civilian clothes and were at least wearing dark clothing, their weapons visible on their backs. The other teams had also been aware of the challenge for a week now and Kakashi had been nice enough to announce the same training field so they could plan around that. He hoped they showed some good use out of all the forewarning. \n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see such enthusiasm,\u201d Umino smiled at all of them from where he hovered at Kakashi\u2019s shoulder. \nAll the kids eyed his clipboard with the same wariness you would eye a rabid dog. \n\u201cDoes he have to watch us?\u201d Inuzuka whined, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m back in the academy.\u201d\nUmino continued smiling like he hadn\u2019t heard. \n\u201cWell, lets get this started,\u201d Kakashi clapped his hands, \u201cSame rules as last time, each of my kids has a bell, you have to get it from them, blah, blah, blah. Ready?\u201d\nTeam Ten and Team eight all exchanged glances, faces set with stubborn determination and then nodded. Kakashi glanced back at his own kids who gave him their best innocent smiles (well Sasuke\u2019s was less a smile and more a politely uninterested look but it was pretty much the same thing). \n\u201cWell, ready set go then,\u201d Kakashi said without any sort of dramatic flare.\nHe neatly ducked Yamanaka\u2019s charge and merely smiled at him when she stuck her tongue out at him on her way past. He ignored how she kicked her heel back at him as if to get in a parting hit and tucked himself out of the way as the teams devolved into a brawl. At least this time there was coordination and teamwork. They even got a decent amount of hits in on Kakashi\u2019s kids. \nTeam seven burst into a cloud of smoke revealing they had been clones.\n\u201cArgh!\u201d the Inuzuka howled. \n\u201cYou had a whole week to prepare,\u201d Kakashi yelled to the kids, \u201cBut so did my team!\u201d\nAs if waiting for that signal the yard exploded in purple smoke amidst the curses. Kakashi landed neatly on a high branch along side Umino who was still jotting down notes even as his feet touched down. \n\u201cDo I want to know why you\u2019ve been following my team around with that for a week?\u201d Kakashi asked blandly, eyes tracking his kids through the bush, \u201cDon\u2019t you have something more important to be doing?\u201d\n\u201cAh, not as much,\u201d Umino smiled like a polite shark, \u201cThis is important work. And you aren\u2019t allowed to know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed?\u201d Kakashi raised a brow.\nSomeone telling him he wasn\u2019t allowed to do something? Someone other than the Hokage? Now that was just a challenge. Umino\u2019s smirk said he knew exactly how Kakashi had just taken then but he wasn\u2019t going to give an inch.\nWell. It would have to wait until after the chunin exam. Then Kakashi would show him just how persistent, and dare he say annoying, he could be. Kakashi turned back to watch Team ten fall straight into a pit trap\n.--.\nTeam Ten and Eight suffered a beat down just as hard as last time, but this time they\u2019d been ready enough to give as good as they got. Mostly. At the end Team Seven was roughed and scuffed but still standing with grins while the other two were collapsed in groaning heaps. \n\u201cMah, meet us back at our place, we\u2019ll handle dinner,\u201d Kakashi smiled at the kids. \n\u201cFood,\u201d Choji moaned deliriously. \nAsuma and Kurenai snuck him a handful of bills and Kakashi gave them a smile before they went to scoop up their kids. Team Seven bound up to him and Kakashi counted out the cash the other two had given him while also adding some of his own. He found an extra wad in his pocket and narrowed his eyes at Umino who smiled innocently back. Had he actually slipped one past Kakashi? Kakashi really was getting tired of all of Umino\u2019s surprises.\n\u201cYou know what to get,\u201d Kakashi said, dividing the cash to his kids.\n\u201cYes sir!\u201d the mock saluted before dashing off. \nKakashi made sure Team Eight and Ten were truly okay under the sensei\u2019s check-up and then headed off on his own. Well, mostly his own, he thought as Umino fell into step with him.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re getting dinner what are you getting?\u201d Umino asked cheerfully as they stepped back into town.\n\u201cBeer,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cFor after the kids fall asleep of course.\u201d\nUmino didn\u2019t give him the stink eye he\u2019d expected and laughed instead.\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair. Those kids would drive me to drink if I had to keep them in line all the time still.\u201d\nAnd so they found a small corner store and Kakashi loaded up on beer while Umino found the good wine section. They both raided the juice section for the kids and they entered the Hatake manor with arms full to find everyone else but Team Seven there. Kakashi\u2019s hounds had obviously let the other teams in and they were in the process of cleaning up, the kids in the washrooms wiping dirt off their hands and faces while Asuma had commandeered his kitchen to get a jug of water and Kurenai was shoving the veranda doors open so the entire living space was open to the courtyard. \n\u201cBeer,\u201d Asuma said reverently helping Kakashi shove it in the fridge, \u201cOne right now can\u2019t hurt right?\u201d\n\u201cUmino let me buy it but I doubt he will let you drink it in front of the kids,\u201d Kakashi said pointedly, \u201cBut it\u2019s your funeral if you want to try.\u201d\nAsuma winced and declined to do so. When the kids finished washing up they joined them, Asuma pouring glasses of water and juice to the still exhausted kids. Team Seven arrived not to much later, arms absolutely loaded down with food to the cheer of the others. Umino and Naruto commandeered the food, laying it out so the table was absolutely loaded before handing plates out. \nThe adults watched their cute little vicious ninja kids squabble over food and get full plates before they grabbed their own. \nOnly when they had eaten their fill did Naruto announce he\u2019d brought ice cream as well. While a few of the kids went to raid the freezer Shikamaru approached Kakashi. \n\u201cI brought Shogi,\u201d Shikamaru told him with narrowed determined eyes.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Kakashi hummed, \u201cI guess we could have a game.\u201d\nShikamaru set it up on the veranda with a grim set to his lips as if he was already imaging defeat; his or Kakashi\u2019s was unknown.\n\u201cI\u2019m so full,\u201d Ino moaned, rolling to bump into Sakura, \u201cWere do you put it all?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a taijutsu specialist, pig,\u201d Sakura mocked biting into her ice cream bar, \u201cI can eat anything I want and not gain anything more than muscle!\u201d\nIno pouted but didn\u2019t roll away, staying curled half around Sakura as she ate another dumpling. \nSasuke, who was a shy boy, had already retreated to the veranda just a ways away from Shikamaru, the over-socializing reaching his tolerance point. Kakashi was surprised the boy didn\u2019t break out in hives when surrounded by so many friendly people who wanted to visit. Naruto dragged him his koto a minute later and Sasuke plucked at it absently, some tension leaving his shoulders. \n\u201cOh, are we doing as song?\u201d Sakura perked up at the strums. \nAnd that was how Kakashi ended up facing Shikamaru in Shogi as Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura played a beautiful little piece, all the kids listening with wide eyes. The adults watched fondly, tucked back in their own conversation as they socialized.\nIt was as close to peace as Kakashi had ever known. \n(He won the game by the way, smiling as Shikamaru gnashed his teeth and demanded another thorough trouncing)\n.--.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get ice-cream!\u201d Naruto yelled as he slid past them.\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d Kakashi said idly.\n\u201cDo you want anything?\u201d Sasuke asked walking past much more calmly than Naruto.\n\u201cMint,\u201d Sakura said from where she was laying in a sunbeam, eyes closed and close to a doze.\n\u201cAnything will do,\u201d Kakashi smiled.\n\u201cHe will want vanilla,\u201d Sakura said.\nKakashi crinkled his eye in a smile as Sasuke nodded solemnly.\n\u201cSasuke! Let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\u201cTake bull with you,\u201d Kakashi said, leaning further into the wall.\nBull lumbered to his feet at his name, tongue lolling as he happily trotted past Sasuke to the front door.\n\u201cOkie dokie!\u201d Naruto agreed even as Sasuke narrowed his eyes at Kakashi.\nKakashi smiled back at the boy who finally grunted acknowledgement. Kakashi knew the ANBU that had been trailing his team was not doing so right now. Things were drawing to a head and everyone had their jobs. The convenience store was only two blocks away, close enough Kakashi would hear Bull howl if there was trouble.\n\u201cWhat flavor do you like, Bull?\u201d Naruto asked as he held the front door open for the massive hound.\nKakashi didn\u2019t hear the answer as Sasuke shut the door behind them. \n\u201cSensei, I want tea,\u201d Sakura said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting ice-cream in a few minutes,\u201d Kakashi said amused.\n\u201cAnd I want tea with it.\u201d\n\u201cThen go make some.\u201d\nSakura peeled an eye open and gave him her best sad look.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m so comfy.\u201d\n\u201cBrat,\u201d Kakashi said fondly and stood up. \nHe put the kettle on and drew out the tea set.\n\u201cSensei! Look who we found!\u201d Naruto shouted before they were even in the front gate. \nKakashi, from where he was putting some cups and the fresh pot of tea on the shaded part of the veranda looked up and bowed his head in greeting. \n\u201cHokage-sama,\u201d he said, \u201cOn a break?\u201d\nThe Hokage gave him a smile, a slight sly edge to it and Kakashi knew there was a clone sitting behind his desk off in the tower and no ANBU nearby. \n\u201cJust a moment\u2019s break,\u201d he said, \u201cNaruto invited me back for ice-cream.\u201d\n\u201cWe have tea too if you would like some, Hokage-sama,\u201d Sakura offered, finally sitting up from her slump. \nKakashi neglected to tell her she had a floorboard pattern pressed into her cheek. Kakashi offered the Kage a cushion and watched as the old man sat down carefully. Naruto handed out ice-cream, putting a vanilla one in his hands before handing the Hokage a mint one. Bull had wandered back to the pack that was lounging under the shaded veranda carrying a bag of sausage that Kakashi gave Sasuke a smile for. \n\u201cThank you, Naruto,\u201d the Hokage smiled.\n\u201cNo problem jiji!\u201d\nNaruto plopped down right next to the Hokage, leaning into him happily as he unwrapped his own treat. Kakashi noted the absolutely fond look the Hokage levelled at the blond. Over ten years ago Kakashi had held Naruto as an infant, had begged the Hokage on his hands and knees to be allowed to watch after Minato-sensei\u2019s son. The Hokage had taken Naruto out of his arms and told him no despite Kakashi\u2019s tears and pleading. The Hokage had looked Kakashi right in the face and denied him completely, ordered him to stay away from Naruto, to never tell the boy who he was to him. \nAnd Kakashi was a loyally ninja of Konoha. He\u2019d obeyed. But somewhere deep in his heart he\u2019d always held a thread of resentment for that. \nKakashi, sitting in the sun with his precious students and watching the Hokage look at Naruto with such a soft expression, let go of that small thread of resentment. It was not forgotten, but in that moment, it was forgiven.\nNo point in what-ifs and thoughts of futures that would never be. Instead Kakashi took happiness in the present, the past was of no consequence. \n.--.\nKakashi woke the morning of the final exam to the soft sound of one of the kids rustling in the kitchen. The sun was peeking above the horizon and there were birds in the courtyard. He could hear his hounds eating breakfast out in the yard and he could hear Naruto moaning about wanting ramen for breakfast as he made his way downstairs. \nKakashi laid in bed and wished he didn\u2019t have to get out of it. There was a pit in the bottom of his stomach that some might call dread, weighing him down and pinning him in place. \nThe kids had spent a month preparing for this part of the exam and Konoha had spent a month getting ready for everything this exam entailed. Everything was ready, his kids were as prepared as he could make them, and the day was beautiful.\nKakashi pulled himself out of bed and couldn\u2019t brush away dread. \nHe found his kids in the kitchen, setting the table with breakfast. Sakura was completely ready to go, armor on, kimono over top, hair brushed back, By the door he spied her ninja sandals and all her weapon pouches ready to be strapped on. Sasuke was close to ready, his armor on but his top missing and his hair unbrushed. Naruto on the other hand was only in pants and still had his eyes closed as he scooped rice into bowls. \nSakura had made breakfast this morning it seemed and had even been nice enough to make eggplant miso. Any other day Kakashi would have smiled over it. But his mouth refused to smile. His kids caught onto the solemn attitude nearly instantly and it wasn\u2019t like they had been very peppy either; anxiety was clear in all their posture. \nBreakfast was eaten in silence and then Sakura shooed Kakashi onto the veranda with tea before she started to browbeat the other two into getting fully ready. \nBy the time the kids were ready the sun had risen fully and they joined him on the veranda, kneeling next to one another seriously as they looked at him. Kakashi considered them all carefully and they met his gaze calmly. \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to pass,\u201d Kakashi said with no trace of doubt, voice steady, \u201cBut do you remember what I said before the exam?\u201d\n\u201cWinning isn\u2019t everything,\u201d Sakura responded immediately.\n\u201cSurvival is,\u201d Sasuke said with feeling.\n\u201cYes. So I want you all to promise me that no matter what happens today, you will survive.\u201d\n\u201cWe promise!\u201d\n\u201cGood. Good,\u201d Kakashi took a moment to breath, \u201cI have something else to ask of you as well and you will not like it. But I want you all to take it easy in your matches. I don\u2019t want you to use even half of your stamina or chakra. Do you understand?\u201d\nThey paused caught by this weird request.\n\u201cYou mean in our first matches?\u201d Sakura asked, \u201cLike save energy for the final rounds?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kakashi said heavily, \u201cI want you to surrender before you use up more than half of your strength today.\u201d\nThey stared at him. Kakashi knew how difficult what he asked of them was. They\u2019d been training all month to give a great showing, to be promoted, and here Kakashi was telling them to throw their matches and not even go half strength. \n\u201cWhy?\u201d Naruto asked plainly, sounding confused.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you,\u201d Kakashi said.\nThey stared at him.\n\u201cANBU have been following me all month,\u201d Sasuke said finally, tone low.\n\u201cAnd your ninken have been following all of us,\u201d Sakura added with narrowed eyes.\n\u201cAnd you had me do so many protective seals my hands hurt,\u201d Naruto said. \n\u201cAnd all the Jonin pulling you aside,\u201d Sakura murmured thoughtful.\n\u201cHayate-sensei,\u201d Sasuke said flatly as if that was an entire conversation.\n\u201cA sannin coming back to town,\u201d Naruto said with a deepening frown.\n\u201cJonin with so few missions out of village they help us multiple times a week,\u201d Sakura said.\n\u201cAnd of course that stupid snake face in the forest,\u201d Naruto said.\n\u201cAnd the guy who attacked us in the hospital,\u201d Sakura scowled. \n\u201cIruka-sensei,\u201d Sasuke said, \u201cGrading us.\u201d\nKakashi stared at them and they stared back. Of course they were right, but he couldn\u2019t say that.\n\u201cLess than half strength,\u201d Kakashi simply repeated, \u201cSave the rest for later.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir!\u201d they chorused.\n\u201cAnd promise me to survive,\u201d he said voice catching.\n\u201cAs long as you do the same,\u201d Sakura told him solemnly.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said with a strained smile.\n\u201cThen none of us are going to die today,\u201d Naruto said, eyes glinting.\n\u201cTeam Seven,\u201d Sasuke nodded sharply, \u201cUntil the end.\u201d\nHe was so very very proud of them.\n.--.\nKakashi stood like a statue, watching his cute little students stride in to the arena like they were heading to war. Their faces were set and grim, their uniforms spotless, their weapons bared. Out of all the kids going down there his kids looked the most ready but not the most grim. \n\u201cReady for the matches?\u201d Gai asked him and his tone was low for once.\nKakashi slanted a gaze at his long-time friend. Took in the usual spandex, the usual vest, the usual leg warmers. Took in the way Gai was weighed down with extra knives but no training weights, looked at the way Gai rolled his shoulders like he was limbering up. \n\u201cReady as we\u2019ll ever be,\u201d Kakashi gave him an eye-smile, \u201cHow are your students?\u201d\n\u201cReady,\u201d Gai said a grin slowly stretching. \n\u201cAnd you?\u201d Kakashi asked offhandedly.\nGai reached out and clasped Kakashi\u2019s hand. Kakashi tried to take strength from the reassurance. Gai gave him no words but he gave Kakashi a look that said \u2018I have your back\u2019. Kakashi squeezed back.\n\u201cFirst match,\u201d Genma called down in the arena, \u201cIs Sakura vs. Temari. The rest of the participants, please return to the seating area.\u201d\nSasuke and Naruto both clasped Sakura\u2019s shoulders as they passed, and she gave a short nod. \nThe Chunin Exam final round was beginning.\n.--.\nSakura and Temari both did their villages proud as they stood attentive and serious as Genma announced the first round and warned of no foul play. They looked like kunoichi in their battle kimono\u2019s and visible armor. Kakashi didn\u2019t keep his ear to the ground on foreign genin but even he recognized the Kazekage\u2019s daughter and knew from her former match that she had a wind-affinity that she used very easily with her battle fan. \nSakura\u2019s plan, that they had went over very carefully together, was focused on getting close enough to use taijutsu while making sure she didn\u2019t have the distance to sweep her fan. Get in and get close was what it summed up to and Kakashi had helped Sakura polish her genjutsu and earth jutsu to help with this very thing. \nThe match began and Sakura didn\u2019t waste even a second as Naruto immediately made a ruckus cheering her on in the stands. Temari, recognizing an opponent who wanted to win, did not react much slower. Her fan was off her back and open in a heartbeat, throwing huge wind blades across the arena even as Genma barely got out of the way. Sakura went right, throwing herself to the side with all her speed she\u2019d gained from Gai. She flicked her wrist and a brace of shuriken went spinning at Temari. A second toss had a brace sent to rebound off the wall and come at Temari\u2019s side. \nThe blonde cutoff her offense to go on the defensive, spinning in a tight circle and raising a whirlwind of wind around herself that sent the weapons hurtling in every direction. When she turned her fan back on Sakura, she blinked.\nThe genjutsu had been quick and flawless for a genin. Kakashi could hear a few mutters of appreciation in the crowd as various people recognized how quickly and easily Sakura had cast that discreet genjutsu. \nTemari\u2019s eyes darted about as she braced her feet and her fan, looking for her opponent. She paused, looking at the trees as if she\u2019d seen someone. Temari blinked, slowly, carefully, and wrinkled her nose.\n\u201cKankuro,\u201d she said curtly to nothing, \u201cI'm\u2026\u201d\nShe paused and looked around, eyes hazy even from where Kakashi stood high above. He watched as she turned, confusion deep set.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026practicing?\u201d Temari muttered, fan lowering. \nA few in the crowd gasped as Sakura crawled out of the earth behind Temari, pulling herself from the dirt as she was pulling out of a pool. \nTemari muttered something, the genjutsu glaze still in her eyes and Sakura wasted no time in getting close and ready, leg coming up to strike at Temari\u2019s head. But at the last minute something tipped Temari off and she ducked, hands snapping together and a \u2018kai\u2019 breaking Sakura\u2019s illusion. Kakashi had money on the girl having sensed something wrong with the wind and air currents around her more than having sensed the genjutsu. A girl that wind-attuned, with a war fan she didn\u2019t even need to use jutsu to channel, was probably very aware of the air around her at all times.\nBut Sakura had gotten what she wanted; she was up close and personal and barely been giving Temari the room to use the folded fan as a defense.\nTo the cheers of the spectators, Sakura engaged in a flurry of taijutsu that was controlled and smooth and absolutely vicious. Temari was no one trick pony and Kakashi knew that sand-nin were considered hardy even by the other nin of the world and always had taijutsu training despite their specialty; so she took the blows with good grace, better than any genin Kakashi could name and tried to give back just as good even as Sakura pursued her relentlessly. \nWhen Temari managed to retreat even the slightest, out came a smaller tessen and a single sharp wind blade was suddenly screaming for Sakura\u2019s throat. Under the gasps and cries of the crowd Sakura exploded into a cloud of cherry blossoms. An expertly used kawarimi, perfectly layered under a small genjutsu, and paired with earth manipulation had Sakura dodging the blow and disappearing under the ground in the blink of an eye.\nSomeone near Kakashi breathed in awe at that simple display of chakra control, especially in a genin. \nWhile Temari was spinning around looking for her opponent, Sakura jumped from the earth in her blind spot, and this time her hands weren\u2019t empty. Sakura raised her war-hammer, a set look on her face and swung.\nTemari spun in time to raise a defense to the blow. Her larger war fan came up between them, tessen dropped in favor of the sturdier fan \u2026\nBut Sakura\u2019s war hammer was solid steel and deadly, and the force behind it was not in anyway meager coming from Sakura. \nThere was a loud crack heard even in the stands as the steel forged battle fan, a splintering crack appearing even as it warped and folded around the hammer blow. The blow, though slowed, was not stopped by the fan as it broke, and the swing continued it\u2019s arch. Sakura buried the hammer into the older girl\u2019s stomach and the blonde was down and out before she even landed from the toss it gave her. \nKakashi hummed as Genma checked on the blonde. If Temari hadn\u2019t gotten her fan up in time, hadn\u2019t absorbed the majority of that blow, Sakura would have probably ruptured some organs and broke every bone in the path of the hammer head. By the mutterings around him, more than a few ninja recognized this as well. He\u2019d have to remind her to watch her rapidly growing strength if she didn\u2019t want to accidentally kill her opponents. \nBut as Genma announced the winner and Naruto went spastic with cheers, Sasuke even smiling down at Sakura, Kakashi caught the gaze on his cute little student\u2019s face. Though there was some pride, there was also a deep-set focus and conviction. \nSakura had known exactly what the blow would have done if Temari hadn\u2019t got her guard up.\nHe\u2019d have to ask her if she\u2019d respected and trusted her opponent enough to block her hit, or if she just hadn\u2019t cared if it connected. \nHe thought about his own serious warnings and how grim he\u2019d been when he sent them off into the tournament today and sighed. Sakura, his most obedient (an in many ways most intelligent) student, was taking him and this very seriously. \nWhen she walked up to his side he still smiled and ruffled her hair.\n\u201cGood job,\u201d he told her, beaming. \n.--.\nNaruto\u2019s match was\u2026interesting. If he had kept quiet most people would have ooed and awed at the types of traps (exploding seals, smoke bombs, even a pitfall somehow). They would have clapped politely when Naruto managed to expertly trip Neji into a trap even with his all-seeing eyes (seeing it doesn\u2019t mean you can avoid it). There would have been mulish appreciation for his skills at so expertly laying and utilizing wires and kunai and seals. \nBut Naruto didn\u2019t keep his mouth shut, and so instead most of the attention of the crowd was focused on what was pretty much an ideological war down in the ring. Neji yelled out plainly what the Hyuuga seal was (airing the Hyuuga\u2019s dirty laundry which most people had already known about but no one liked to speak of), and belittled Naruto in a way that had a few people smiling and agreeing.\nAnd Naruto yelled back. He shouted and raged and cursed fate aloud and everyone hung onto his words nearly breathlessly. Because Naruto when he spoke, he spoke with his whole heart.\nNaruto spoke with passion, conviction, and pure empathy. He was golden and bright and enduring. His charisma, Kakashi thought idly, he must have got from both Minato and Kushina. Minato had been Hokage, had been a leader who inspired. But Kushina had been a woman of passion who\u2019s closest gazed at her like she was the sun (even Minato). And Naruto was both. \nEven those who did not believe Naruto\u2019s words were still quiet and contemplative as Naruto followed his speech up by summoning huge twisting dragons of water and fire at nearly the same time in a blazing display. And then used none of these big fancy jutsu or flashy traps, but instead used a simple clone buried under the ground to punch Neji out. \nNaruto won and Kakashi smiled at him when he looked up at his team. Around the arena was applause but it was awed and confused and wary. They would realize one day, what sort of person Naruto was; this was just the beginning.\n.--.\nSasuke\u2019s match, in comparison to the other two, was a bit dull. Not that it wasn\u2019t full of beautiful footwork and powerful punches. Not that it wasn\u2019t a glorious showing of taijutsu but\u2026 well, all ninja had seen taijutsu everyday and it was easy to admire it while still being bored. The audience was a little more enraptured watching Sasuke and lee bounce off walls and exchange blows in the air. But in the end there was no exchanging of flashy ninjutsu or traps. There were no great clashes of ideology yelled with born conviction. There was brute strength but it wasn\u2019t as shocking as a war hammer smashing through steel. \nThe match was won when Sasuke used the subtlest of subtle genjutsu. Lee could use his chakra inwardly for water -walking and the like, which meant he could disrupt it well enough to break a genjutsu, but he also wasn\u2019t as skilled at them as Sasuke was. And all Sasuke needed was the two seconds that it would throw Lee off. The genjutsu was one that simply made Lee think Sasuke was two feet to the left of where he truly was. Not enough to alarm him, but enough his punches went to wide and he couldn\u2019t dodge. \nSasuke didn\u2019t look up at his team when he was announced the winner but they all smiled and clapped anyways and Kakashi could see the way his ears had turned pink.\n.--.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Kakashi asked.\nHis kids jolted, faces morphing into innocent expressions as they discreetly tucked everything away before they realized it was him. The sound of the crowds above returning to their seat after the intermission was a low rumble. \n\u201cJust some seal stuff for Sakura,\u201d Naruto said. \n\u201cSeal stuff,\u201d Kakashi raised a brow.\n\u201cFor when she faces Gaara,\u201d Naruto said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s,\u201d Kakashi frowned, \u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea Naruto. Don\u2019t mix seals with that boy.\u201d\n\u201cWe know what he is sensei,\u201d Sakura piped in now, voice low and careful. \n\u201cThen you know you shouldn\u2019t be using seals around him,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cToo many things to go wrong.\u201d\n\u201cWe thought so too,\u201d Naruto said, \u201cBut remember what that stupid snake used to knock me out in the forest?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean an advanced seal that someone of Sakura\u2019s level should not be using on someone like Gaara without practice?\u201d Kakashi raised a brow.\n\u201cI found a shortcut,\u201d Naruto blurted out, \u201cOr well, I reworked it! I just finished it last night!\u201d\nKakashi held out his hand wordlessly and Naruto handed over a scroll. Kakashi unrolled it carefully and already found it full of sharp black lines. As was usual, Naruto\u2019s writing was atrocious, or perhaps genius, and it took a long moment for him to untangle what he was looking at. Kakashi opened his mouth, paused, closed it and kept reading. He looked over it twice, thrice, four times and then gave Naruto a flat look.\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he asked flatly. \n\u201cIsn\u2019t it great,\u201d Naruto beamed, jittery in a way he got when he was happy about his work, \u201cSee, I accounted for the mixing of chakra here, and then the knock-out part here, and to make sure he wouldn\u2019t die right here.\u201d \nKakashi watched Naruto point out lines and even with that tiny breakdown he had no idea how this whole thing worked; but it looked like it did. \n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Kakashi whispered to himself again.\nHe knew Naruto was good with seals, it\u2019s why he\u2019d had Naruto help with suppressing the Curse seal, why he\u2019d sent Naruto to Jiraya, why he\u2019d had Naruto helping with the wall defense seals. But this\u2026Naruto had broken down the 5-point seal used on him in the forest, an offensive seal used in combat to interact with other seals, and somehow spread it across paper to be its own stand-alone offensive seal. Kakashi didn\u2019t know enough about seals to know exactly what he was looking at but he knew it was amazing and he knew it worked. \nNo wonder the Uzumaki had been so feared.\nKakashi rolled the seal up very carefully and held it out to Sakura. When she brightened and went to take it he didn\u2019t let go until she met his eyes.\n\u201cThis is a last resort, do you understand?\u201d he asked seriously, \u201cOnly if\u2026well, you know. Do not use this in your match.\u201d\nSakura met his solemn look with her own and nodded gravely.\n\u201cGood job Naruto,\u201d Kakashi said a tad gentler, \u201cOn the seal and on looking after your teammates.\u201d\nDespite the tension Naruto beamed.\n.--.\nThe crowd had been excited for the first portion of the final exam, but with the second round now on, they were practically ecstatic. The civilians barely noticed that many of their shinobi counterparts had not returned to fill the seats they had previously been in. \n\u201cGaara of Suna vs Sakura of Konoha for the first match of the second round,\u201d Genma announced, \u201cContenders, please come down to the arena.\u201d\nGaara appeared in a swirl of sand, arms crossed and face impassive. Sakura entered more casually, measuring her steps carefully and face calm. Kakashi slowed his breathing to match hers. Naruto reached out and grasped Kakashi\u2019s hand. Kakashi looked down at the grim little blond and squeezed briefly.\n\u201cGo sit with your friends Naruto,\u201d he said softly.\nNaruto heard the order. He squeezed his hand back and then went to sit with Team Eight, making someone grumble as he climbed seats to get to them. Sasuke watched him sit and then slanted a look at Kakashi. \n\u201cTeam Ten looks bored,\u201d Kakashi said lightly.\nSasuke frowned but carefully looked at Gai who was beside Kakashi. He gave a short nod and obeyed. Gai watched him leave and raised a brow at Kakashi but Kakashi was already focusing back on the arena where Gaara and Sakura were squaring off, Genma retreating as the match began. \nThe first bit of the match seemed to dull the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm. Sakura tested Gaara\u2019s sand defense with barrages of kunai and shuriken but otherwise stayed enough distance away she had plenty of time to dodge the spears of sand sent right back at her. Gaara watched her with narrowed eyes but didn\u2019t ramp up the violence yet as he watched her test his defense. An earth clone went at his blind spot and he obliterated it without looking away from the real Sakura. \nAnd then Gaara grew impatient and the spears of sand turned into arms and waves and Sakura had to start really moving. They weren\u2019t sure if underground was safe for her, if it was only sand or earth he could move, and so Sakura took top leaping about like a grasshopper. She realized nearly as quickly as he did that Gaara did indeed have to actually focus on controlling all the sand outside of his defense and so she had precious few seconds to use his own sand as foot holds before he could redirect it at her. \nSakura didn\u2019t have the same natural flexibility Sasuke did, leaning towards a bulkier build, but she did still have speed, especially with the training she had gotten with Gai and Lee. She had stamina too.\nKakashi watched their dance and heard a few bored grumbles in the crowd but he felt entirely on edge. One swipe from the sand and she would be down. She\u2019d be crushed and\u2026\n\u201cI forfeit!\u201d Sakura called, bright and clear as she leapt over a spear of sand.\nKakashi released a careful breath. Good girl. \n\u201cWin to Gaara!\u201d Genma announced.\nBut\u2026but Gaara had not stopped the offence. A spear of sand whirled straight for Sakura\u2019s throat and she dodged, her guard not let down even with her surrender.\n\u201cI forfeit!\u201d Sakura yelled at Gaara who kept attacking.\nThe few ninja in the stands got antsy as Gaara seemed to not hear her words. Genma\u2019s face was grim from where he was setting the microphone down, legs bracing to throw himself into the ring. \nAnd then feathers were falling from the air and the civilians started to slump and Kakashi could no longer worry about Sakura down in the ring with a demon. \n\u201cSo it begins,\u201d Kakashi clenched his hands.\n.--.\nThe Oto and Suna nin hidden in the audience were quick to reveal themselves, their opening move made with the civilians rendered unconscious and vulnerable. Kakashi killed a man who barely had time to do anything but shed his henge. Kakashi\u2019s kunai found a second throat only a moment after that, slitting him from ear to ear as he tried to go for a civilian. Kakashi heard distance rumbles of explosions, felt the static in the air as jutsu rose.\nHe knew the majority of Konoha shinobi were already in place, ignorant genin and chunin having coincidentally be assigned mission at vulnerable choke points; the hospital had somehow mistakenly gotten four teams of chunin assigned to each wing instead of one team. The academy had teams of chunin guests, all scheduled to show flashy moves to the kids. The civilian market had been assigned more genin than normal to street clean. \nAll over Konoha the shinobi forces had been strategically placed to best help. And all the shinobi in Konoha knew exactly how to act in the case of direct attack (they had been drilled over and over and over in the academy and outside of it). \nHow lucky for Konoha civilians that the evacuation tunnels had been recently re-secured, had been restocked, and had had reminders discreetly sent out to major families on their entrances. How lucky for Konoha citizens that every genin in Konoha had had recent drills on how to evacuate citizens and secure evacuation tunnel entrances. How lucky for Konoha that a great deal of security tags had been re-written and attached to the walls. How lucky for Konoha that every active shinobi who could be spared had been recalled.\nKakashi snapped a man\u2019s neck and smiled a vicious satisfied smile as he heard the sound of explosions repelled by security seals along the outer-wall. Only ten people knew how the defenses on the Outerwall had been reworked in the past two weeks. Only someone, say a traitor who had abandoned Konoha over a decade ago, would be expecting the older usual defenses. \nKakashi pulled his tanto free and lunged for Team ten. He was vicious in a way he had not been in years. There was no careful restraint, no smoothing the edges of his moves. Instead Kakashi lunged all unleashed brutality and deadliness. The three nin looming over Team Ten all fell with their throats cut to the bone.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Kakashi asked.\nSasuke nodded sharp and honest, face set and grim. He had a kunai in hand, his Satsuma in the other, ready to defend. At his feet looking wide eyed and scared was Yamanaka Ino, Akimichi Chouji, and Nara Shikamaru, unprepared and flounderingly though Kakashi caught the glimpse of a shadow retreating so maybe not completely caught off guard. \nNaruto\u2019s roar rang across the arena, loud and challenging as it echoed, and over a hundred of him flooded into the gallery. Many leaping into the ring where Kakashi couldn\u2019t afford to focus. Sakura had Naruto and Genma to back her up and a seal that could stop even Gaara in his tracks. An explosion shook the far wall as a Naruto-clone handily took out a jonin with an explosive tag strapped to his chest.\n\u201cGo to Sakura,\u201d Kakashi ordered Sasuke, \u201cProtect your team and then work outwards. First priority is civilians!\u201d\nSasuke was gone, air sparking with electricity.\n\u201cProtect the civilians, head towards the academy,\u201d Kakashi barked at Team Ten, \u201cFor Konoha.\u201d\nThey rallied quickly, snapping off salutes. \n\u201cFor Konoha!\u201d\nThen he was lunging at a set of enemies who suddenly realized who they were facing. He got one look at their terrified eyes before Gai hit them like a wrecking ball leaving Kakashi to go at the backs of four ninja behind them. \nBehind him, from the ring came screams. Infront of him, in the city came screams. Above him, behind purple barriers were screams. Kakashi roared his challenge as he went for the throat of his enemies, fang bared. \n.--.\nFinding his students proved quite easy in the aftermath. There was smoke in the air and blood on the ground and bodies in the streets but Kakashi only had to follow the carnage. \nHe went past teams of Oto-nin dead in the street, burns littering their skin.\n\u201cThey were like demons,\u201d one man whispered, reverently, \u201cThey saved me and my wife from a team of enemy ninja. The dark haired one looked like he came straight from the fire itself, all smoke and ash.\u201d\nHe walked past a team of men and women strewn like puppets, still hanging morbidly.\n\u201cThey garroted them,\u201d a chunin told him quietly, eyes still wide, \u201cIt was like a spider web of wire all laid perfectly to trap the oto-nin.\u201d\nHe walked past enemy nin downed by arrows to the throat or eyes.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even sense them,\u201d a kunoichi shook her head ruefully, \u201cI was pinned down and then the enemy started dropping like flies.\u201d\nHe walked past stone and rock crumbled and ruptured, dead men pinned between.\n\u201cThe girl was like a hurricane,\u201d a little girl told him like she was revealing a secret, \u201cShe was so strong she cracked the earth like a giant and blew all the bad guys away!\u201d\nHe passed a dead snake the size of a street, its eyes glassy in death.\n\u201cIt was like wave of sunshine,\u201d an elderly man said smiling, \u201cthat copy thing you ninja do to make more of yourselves. All blond and orange as he brought the snake down.\u201d\nAnd Kakashi went on, walking past throngs of dead and feeling pride and worry in equal measures as he realized how hard his students had fought and defended their city. They had used everything he had given them, taijutsu, genjutsu, ninjutsu, and weapons. \nHe found Sasuke\u2019s Satsuma pinning a dead enemy to the ground and retrieved it silently. He found Naruto\u2019s haori ripped and abandoned in the middle of a ring of dead men and took it as well. Sakura left nothing of hers behind but the print of her fist upon the earth; she always had been more organized then the boys. \nWhen he finally found them, they were laid out across the ground like they had simply laid down for a nap amidst the destruction. The ground was torn and the trees crumpled and the ground was drinking blood. And yet they all looked peaceful, eyes closed and hands held together. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen;\n\u201cKakashi,\u201d Sakura murmured, voice hoarse and hands trembling, her knuckles broken. \n\u201cSensei?\u201d Naruto opened an eye, his shirt cracking with the amount of blood caking it.\n\u201cHn,\u201d Sasuke said, tone oddly peaceful even as he opened his eyes, tear tracts of blood on his pale skin. \nKakashi fell to his knees and openly wept to see them alive.\n\u201cDid we do good sensei?\u201d Sakura asked even as she tangled her broken fingers in his shirt.\n\u201cWe totally beat the snot out of the enemy,\u201d Naruto beamed.\n\u201cAnd their jinchuriki,\u201d Sasuke added with a grunt.\nKakashi simply wept to see them. They curled about him as if to reassure him and held him as he was wracked with sobs, guilty and proud of what his students had accomplished. Team Seven had survived the Chunin Exams. \n.--.THE END.--."
