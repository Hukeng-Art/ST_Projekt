    "text": "Stiles was sitting in his advanced mythology class when the suits walked in. There were three of them, obviously government type, and Stiles spotted at least two concealed weapons on each of them. He couldn't help but wonder what they were doing in his class. He was careful not to react beyond mild interest at what would obviously be an interruption. He watched as they pulled the professor aside, watched as his prof nodded before stepping back.\u00a0\n\u201cThank you for allowing us to interrupt.\u201d one man said, going for kindly, but his eyes were too sharp for Stiles to find it believable. \u201cWe are here from S.H.I.E.L.D. and are here to present what could be an opportunity for every one of you.\u201d and that had Stiles' attention. A recruitment speech? That was certainly unexpected. While the first one spoke, presenting the benefits of S.H.I.E.L.D., the other two handed out forms to the 40 students in the room, and Stiles couldn't help but raise his eyebrows as he looked at the questionnaire. What was his favourite colour? Write an essay on why movie interpretations were better than the book? Well that question was obviously to see how well you could lie because everyone knows that the books are always better. The rest of the questions though reminded Stiles of a psych eval, and that grated at him. He hated psych evals, but the short essay questions were amusing; if you could have any super power, what would it be and why? Explain why the moon is better than the sun.\u00a0\nLetting his amusement guide him, Stiles filled out the form as if it were serious, because hey, why not right? He was definitely going to be limited in what a degree in Mythology with minors in Latin and Biology. Not that he'd been worried since the information was more for the pack than anything else. Going to MIT allowed him to apprentice under one of the most well renowned witches to help him train his Spark. When he handed back the questionnaire along with every other student, Stiles never expected to hear back from them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou'll never guess who came to my class for a recruitment speech.\u201d Stiles opened with the moment Derek picked up the phone, and he didn't miss the huff the alpha gave him.\u00a0\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cS.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d there was a pause, and then-\n\u201cThe ones who broke New York?\u201d Stiles couldn't help but laugh.\u00a0\n\u201cThat would have been the Avengers, but yeah, they're technically the ones who got them all together. To be fair they also handled clean up.\u201d Derek just gave a grunt.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDunno. They gave out a super weird questionnaire. Kind of a mix between a psych eval and a creative writing assignment. If it wasn't for the fact that nobody would dare impersonate S.H.I.E.L.D. in New York of all places I would have thought it was fake.\u201d\n\u201cYou had your myth discussion class today, right?\u201d Derek asked then, and Stiles couldn't help his smile.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cI don't trust it. As important as your studies are, they don't exactly promote an interest in a government agency.\u201d\n\u201cI had the same thought.\u201d he flopped back on the bed in his small room in residence, kicking his shoes off onto the floor. \u201cBut I filled it out anyways. Why not, right?\u201d there was a pause and Stiles rolled his eyes. \u201cIf they try and contact me I'll call you, sourwolf. Chill.\u201d Derek gave a low growl but Stiles just snorted out a laugh. \u201cAnyways, tell me about the house \u2013 you guys almost finished painting?\u201d\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nStiles had almost forgotten about the recruitment form he'd filled out until the knock came on his door nearly a month later in the form of another suit standing outside his room in residence. He had his phone to his ear, Isaac on the other end, and stopped short when he came face to face with the unamused looking man.\u00a0\n\u201cIsaac, my man, I gotta go. Tell Derek I'll call him in an hour.\u201d he said lightly, but he knew Isaac knew what it meant. If he didn't call in an hour, he was in trouble. He hung up, sliding his phone into his pocket, looking at the man with a raised eyebrow. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Stilinski, you've been selected for an interview.\u201d he was handed an envelope and couldn't help his surprise as he opened the letter to see what he assumed was the official S.H.I.E.L.D. letterhead.\u00a0\n\u201cThis says my interview is tonight.\u201d\n\u201cYes. The university was consulted for your schedule.\u201d and that was all he was getting apparently.\u00a0\n\u201cGreat.\u201d but the man didn't move. \u201cIs there something else?\u201d\n\u201cWill you need assistance arriving at the interview?\u201d that had Stiles lifting a sarcastic brow.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy, you going to wait around to escort me?\u201d he snorted out a laugh, ignoring the slight narrowing of the man's eyes. \u201cThanks but no thanks, man. I can get there myself. But I'll make sure to let them know when I get there that you offered.\u201d he gave a lazy salute and closed the door without waiting for a response, throwing the lock and reinforcing it with his Spark just in case the guy got any ideas. But after only a moment he heard the man's footsteps leaving and turned his attention back to the letter in his hand, pulling out his phone and dialling Derek's number.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d was the immediately growled response, and Stiles grinned.\n\u201cI have an interview with S.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nStiles wasn't really surprised this time when the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent showed up at his dorm. The interview had gone very similarly to the questionnaire, if not more informal, and at this point, Stiles figured if he could pass the questionnaire, the interview would be no different. The agent who showed up didn't stay this time, just gave him a package that informed him that he had to show up at 06:00 the next day for orientation and Stiles had just been annoyed that of course he would have to be up early on a Saturday. Only problem being that he'd promised Derek that he'd visit home to add another ward to the now finished Hale house. He could theoretically change his flight from tonight to an afternoon one tomorrow - but Derek was not going to be pleased. On the other hand though, he actually wanted to go to this interview and he also knew Derek would understand that. He looked at his phone and for a moment he couldn't help but glare at it viciously. He wished he could be telling the pack about all this in person - missed them desperately and realized that with this job he might not be going home at the end of the semester when he graduated. The realization was a weight in his stomach. He didn't realize he'd dialled his phone until Derek was saying his name, and he swallowed past the lump in his threat.\n\"They hired me.\"\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nHe should have known that orientation also meant fitness test/competency with combat and he was extremely grateful now that he'd decided back in high school to train with Alison and Chris and later Braeden. Glad that when Peter and Derek had offered him lessons of their own, he'd accepted. Though he'd never be as fast as a wolf, he'd learned how to be just as dangerous. At the beginning he made sure to keep himself in check though - just because he was capable didn't necessarily mean he wanted these people to know. When it was his turn on the mat however and he was faced with a guy who looked every bit the douchebag he proved himself to be when he gave Stiles a once over and a sneer, Stiles made a new deal with himself. He'd hold himself back but there was no way he wouldn't kick this guys ass.\n\u00a0\n\"Agent Stilinski.\" And he couldn't deny the little thrill it gave him to hear those words even as he looked up from where he'd knocked the douche on his ass. Something about the way this \u00a0guy carried himself told Stiles that he wasn't a new recruit and he was wary now as he followed when the man waved him over to a new mat, tossing his sweater down. Stiles pushed a hand through his hair, not moving onto the mat but not stepping away. There was a glimmer in this guys eyes that said he was looking forward to beating Stiles and it made it clear that Stiles hadn't been as subtle as he'd hoped. That was his prides fault and he knew it but he was no longer the skinny kid who got his ass handed to him to hurt his friends - he was the one who fought tooth and nail to keep his friends from getting hurt and somewhere along the line he'd learned that doing that meant protecting himself from harm too. But this guy looked too much like Jackson had been at the beginning - he knew he was good and he wanted to knock Stiles down a peg for thinking he was good enough. If Stiles had hackles he knew they'd rise.\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"Agent Ward. I was asked to do a demonstration.\" And Stiles couldn't help his reply.\n\u201cOrdered more like.\" And watched the agent give a grin that promised pain.\n\u201cStep onto the mat agent Stilinski.\" Stiles knew this was a test - knew he was expected to be beat up but take it because he was new and sometimes the enemy beat you and you should never show too much pride. But even as he knew that he also knew Ward would have to knock him out to stop him from fighting back because he was nobodies punching bag and they'd chosen him to be here just like they'd chosen Ward. Without hesitation he stepped onto the mat.\n\u00a0\nStiles felt grim satisfaction as he pressed the ice pack to his black eye. He'd taken a couple hits and his ribs were a bit sore but he'd given as good as he'd gotten and though Stiles hadn't won the fight it had been a definite draw. It gave him a vindictive sort of pleasure that he couldn't even be bothered to not feel.\n\"That was quite an impressive display, Agent Stilinski.\" A voice said, interrupting his thoughts. \"We've been hard pressed to find anyone able to take on Ward in quite a while.\" Stiles looked up to see a man who was probably in his mid 40s giving him a wry smile. He was wearing a much nicer suit than the suits from before and Stiles figured this was probably Ward's superior. When he didn't say anything, the man sat next to him in the chairs outside of medical. \"I'm impressed.\" The man said then earning a wary glance from Stiles. \"We've been trying to find someone to knock him down a peg or two and you did the job quite well.\" That had Stiles narrowing his eyes.\n\"So you used me.\"\n\"On the contrary; Ward's attempt to use you backfired and put you on my radar.\" He lowered the ice pack.\n\"And just who are you?\"\n\"Phil Coulson.\"\n\"Right.\" Stiles said, drawing the word out. \"Are you supposed to kill me or something?\" For a moment the smile flickered to something more genuine before settling back to blandly polite.\n\"No, I'm here to offer you an opportunity. I watched your fight with Ward - the only reason you allowed yourself to show your full skill set was because you refused to let him make an example of you for his own ego. I admire that quality and I would like you to work under my command.\" Stiles knew the man was being sincere but that didn't mean he wasn't still a little suspicious.\n\"Last I checked you were the handler for the Avengers. I'm not really looking to be front line fodder against their enemies.\" And there was that flash of genuine amusement again. Stiles was beginning to realize it was approval.\n\"Good.\" He handed Stiles a card. \"I recognize you have to finish your studies. The moment their finished is when you begin. I'll debrief you in my office.\" With that he stood, doing up the single button of his jacket before leaving. Stiles just pushed the ice against his eye again, holding the card in his other hand. He let his head fall back against the wall, wincing at the impact. What was his life turning into?\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\n3 weeks 2 days and 4 hours later, Stiles was knocking on the door of the office designated as Agent Coulson's. He'd finished his final exam\u00a0and hadn't even thought twice before making his way here and even as he knocked he felt a bit ridiculous. Agent Coulson probably hadn't meant immediately after he was finished - but he hadn't been able to help himself. The door opened and that flash of a smile appeared.\n\"Right on time.\" Even as he stepped in the room he saw another man was already in the room and he instantly recognized who it was.\n\"Hawkeye.\" He blurted out, and then couldn't help his flush. The archer just blinked in surprise before offering a smirk. He obviously hadn't expected to be recognized - at least not instantly.\n\"You must be Agent Stilinski. Ward's still pissed you beat him at your orientation.\"\n\"I didn't beat him.\" Was his instant reply, but Clint shrugged.\n\"You kept it even which is as good as against Ward.\" Stiles just looked back at Coulson and found a uniform being handed to him.\n\"This is yours. It's your uniform.\"\n\"Great, okay - uniform for what exactly?\" He was handed a folder next and flipped it open.\n\"Analyst. Alright. What exactly am I analyzing?\"\n\"It's all in the file. If you'll follow me -\" Coulson lead the way out of his office and Stiles noticed that Hawkeye followed them.\n\"Don't you have super secret spy stuff to be doing?\" Stiles couldn't help but ask and Clint just smirked.\n\"Yes.\" He didn't stop following them though and Stiles narrowed his eyes which only make Clint's smirk widen. Stiles scowled and turned back to Coulson who lead him into a room with about 10 other agents in it.\n\"This is where you'll be working.\" Stiles noticed that everyone here was wearing the exact same outfit Stiles was holding in his hands and hid a snicker behind a cough.\n\"So when do you want me to start?\"\n\"Tomorrow. For now, review the packet and then report tomorrow at 0:700.\u201d Stiles could only nod, gripping the file tightly in his hands. When he glanced over his shoulder to see if they were still being followed, Hawkeye was nowhere to be found and Stiles just shook his head. Damn supers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBeing an analyst, even under Agent Coulson, who he learned was a lot more renowned than he'd thought \u2013 was still kind of boring. He was doing exactly what he'd always done \u2013 piles and piles of research \u2013 the difference being that here the subject wasn't always of his choice. It was on intel being gathered for missions across the board \u2013 and while he felt pretty damn special being trusted enough right off the bat to go through all the information for some of the highest level of missions going on, he couldn't help but feel like this wasn't his place. After all, what was a guy like him with only minimal (reported) skill for this sort of thing doing research that could actually hurt someone if done wrong. Sure, research had been a big part of his schooling but that meant nothing in this scenario. A lot of the data that passed through his hands was more technical \u2013 less up for interpretation. Not to mention that all of it directly related to what could potentially become Avengers related missions. Which was a lot of stress. Not to mention the fact that people were constantly trying to get on this team \u2013 begging and bribing and even sometimes threatening \u2013 and all because he'd taken on Ward in a physical fight? It didn't sit well with him.\u00a0\n\u201cDid you ever consider,\u201d Lydia had told him softly one night when they were Skyping, \u201cthat it isn't about the fact that you beat him, but that you wouldn't back down to a bully?\u201d and he hadn't really considered that but he knew she was right. So he'd continued on \u2013 continued his work for Coulson and ignored the fact that more and more of the information he dealt with became more and more to do with the Avengers. It wasn't until the moment that he realized that he hadn't even seen any information relating to any other missions in a week that he confronted Coulson.\u00a0\n\u201cI'm not qualified for this.\u201d Stiles said even as he walked in the door, and Coulson looked up at him with raised brows. He knew that nobody else dared to just barge into Coulson's office, but he couldn't be bothered to care. \u201cI've only been here for a few months and I haven't had any real training but I'm handling information for Avenger missions. There are tons of agents with way more experience clamouring for this kind of work \u2013 tons of agents who are trained for this kind of thing. None of which are me. The only thing I had going for me was that stupid fight with Agent Ward, so what am I doing here?\u201d Coulson had remained quiet during the whole rant, and stayed quiet after, watching Stiles impassively, but Stiles didn't budge \u2013 didn't fidget \u2013 wouldn't be ashamed or back down. He was right, damn it, and he knew it. After a minute of tense silence, that flash of a smile passed over Agent Coulson's face again and he set his pen down, sitting back in his chair.\n\u201cAnd that is exactly why you're qualified. You never expected or even wanted to work with this information; you handle it the exact same way you handled all other information that crossed your desk and your fight with Agent Ward was proof enough that you're willing to fight for what you believe in.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what exactly do you think that is?\u201d because he couldn't deny Coulson's first claim \u2013 he'd never really wanted to work on Avenger stuff \u2013 not because it wasn't cool but because he'd had his taste of danger already and knew it wasn't as exciting as it seemed; and he did treat the information the same because he knew how bad having bad information could be \u2013 had the scars to prove it.\u00a0\n\u201cYou believe that you don't deserve to be treated as anybodies lesser just because you're young or new or smaller \u2013 and that belief extends to other people. You have a rare view on equality, Agent Stilinski, as much as you'd think that wasn't the case in todays society. Unless someone has proven themselves unworthy, you believe they are at least your equal. That's admirable.\u201d and he'd never realized he was so transparent before. Before he could respond, the hairs on the back of his neck stood up and he knew someone was behind him, and too close for comfort. He took two quick steps forward before turning to see Hawkeye lounging against the doorframe and just let out a breath.\u00a0\n\u201cI'll be at my desk, sir.\u201d he said to Agent Coulson and was quick to pass by the archer, avoiding his gaze.\u00a0\nAs soon as Stiles was gone, Clint turned back to Phil and pulled the thumb drive out of his pocket, tossing across the room. Phil caught it easily, tucking it into his pocket.\u00a0\n\u201cStark's having a thing tonight. Nat wants to know if you're coming cause she wants pizza.\u201d Phil smiled at that. He was the only other person with her love of the hottest peppers mixed with pineapple on a pizza.\u00a0\n\u201cTell her I'll be late, I have to finish writing the brief for Fury.\u201d Clint just nodded, but before he could leave he turned back to Phil.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy do you think he doesn't think he's qualified?\u201d he asked, honestly curious, because he'd worked off the intel agent Stilinski had compiled and it was thorough. Phil didn't answer right away, but when he did he made sure to meet Clint's gaze.\u00a0\n\u201cI have a feeling that agent Stilinski has experienced a lot of things in his life, despite his age.\u201d was what Phil opened with and it had Clint frowning. \u201cAnd I think that those experiences have made him wary of danger. While everyone else finds being able to work on missions for the avengers is exciting and exhilarating, Stiles treats the team like you're just normal people \u2013 like anything could kill you \u2013 and he's not wrong. But that's what makes him good. He doesn't let anything slide because you're the Avengers. He acts like he knows the consequences of that. But on that note, he's never worked for a serious agency before. If his father wasn't the sheriff of his home town he'd probably have a record because of his insatiable curiosity, and he's afraid someone will get hurt because he missed something because he's new to all of this.\u201d Clint opened his mouth to answer and then thought better of it. He needed to think about this. So he shook his head and changed the subject.\n\u201cRumour is, Ward's looking for a rematch. He isn't likely to play by the rules.\u201d\n\u201cIf Ward thinks that agent Stilinski is easier to fight caught by surprised, he may learn another valuable lesson.\u201d\n\u201cWhat lesson is that?\u201d\n\u201cThat his pride will always cost him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nIt was only years of instinct that had Stiles ducking out of the way when the baton was swinging towards his head from around the corner. He spun around, catching the baton this time and twisting as he pulled, freeing the weapon from the hands of his attacker before he tossed it down the hall, turning back just in time to see Ward coming at him, throwing up his arms to block a swing towards his head. It was the end of the day - everyone else had gone home in this wing, and it looked like Ward knew that - knew he usually stayed late, knew he was usually the last in this area, because he\u2019d come prepared. He forced Stiles back before he could catch his balance and Stiles\u2019 lips pulled back in a snarl.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the hell is your problem?\u201d and Ward just scoffed, grabbing another baton from his belt. This one, however, was one he recognized, and his eyes narrowed when the electricity crackled along it\u2019s length. Ward swung it forward but Stiles shoved himself back out of reach. From the sound of the buzz, the wattage on that thing was higher than it should have been, and if it hit him he\u2019d be down for the count. He needed to stop Ward, and fast. Problem was, Ward had thought this through. He\u2019d cornered him in a hall where the only way out was past him or pack through a door with a passcode. While Stiles knew the code, it would take him time to input it, and that was valuable time he didn\u2019t have. He vaulted back, grabbing the baton he\u2019d disarmed Ward of before, and would\u2019ve rolled his eyes at how typical it was that this one was just a regular old baton. He ducked and did a sweep with his leg the next time the baton came towards him, and when Ward jumped he moved in close, shoving the baton up in close, snapping it against Ward\u2019s elbow that held the electrified wand. Ward grunted out in pain but didn\u2019t release the wand and Stiles only just managed to get out of the way before it caught him in the side. They squared off and Ward bared his teeth in a mockery of a smile. Stiles\u2019 just swung the baton around, getting ready. If he could just get Ward to drop the baton he\u2019d be able to at least get past him, but it was getting in close enough to disarm him that was the dangerous part. Ward came at him again and Stiles was forced to stay on the defensive. He was exhausted from the strain of the day, stressed from the fact that he hadn\u2019t been home to visit the pack in way too long, and confused about why a certain archer was being found more and more often around and always where he had to be - he didn\u2019t have time for this shit. That\u2019s when it hit him. He didn\u2019t have time for this shit. He didn\u2019t have to have time. He was on the defensive trying not to cause any damage, but Ward was trying to take him out, and take him out hard.\u00a0\n\u201cScrew this.\u201d he snarled, and he dropped down, throwing the baton in his hand at Ward\u2019s hip, tossing him off balance when he tried to catch himself after avoiding the blow, and in the same motion Stiles grabbed the knife he kept in his boot, coming up fast. Without any hesitation, he snaked forward, slicing the knife down across Ward\u2019s forearm, and when his arm jolted in reaction, opening his hand, Stiles grabbed the electrified baton as it fell, slamming it into Ward\u2019s stomach. \u201cWeren\u2019t expecting that, were you, asshole.\u201d Stiles snapped. He huffed out a breath, falling back against the wall as he looked at the baton in his hand, turning off the electricity. He looked over at the sound of quick footsteps approaching and grimaced when none other than the archer he\u2019d been thinking of showed up.\u00a0\n\u201cI think maybe he shouldn\u2019t be allowed access to the big boy toys.\u201d Stiles muttered, tossing the now safe baton at Clint, who caught it easily, looking from the weapon to Ward, expression darkening.\u00a0\n\u201cWord got round that Ward looked ready to do some damage. Figured he\u2019d come after you.\u201d was the archer\u2019s reply, and Stiles just stared at him a moment.\n\u201cYou coming to my rescue?\u201d and Clint shrugged.\n\u201cWard was pissed. I\u2019m not surprised he tried to fight dirty.\u201d and Stiles didn\u2019t miss the disapproval to his tone.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah well, so did I.\u201d Stiles admitted, showing the knife. Clint blinked at him but then chuckled.\u00a0\n\u201cGood for you.\u201d and that was approval. Then he pulled the heavy duty cuffs out of his back pocket, shoving Ward over with his foot to snap them around his wrists behind his back. \u201cWant to help me drag his ass to holding?\u201d and Stiles gave a vindictive grin.\u00a0\n\u201cDamn straight I do.\u201d\u00a0\nAs they hauled Ward up between them, Stiles glanced across his unconscious form to where Clint held the man up on the other side. This was the fourth time this week the archer had just so happened to come across him, and this time he knew it was on purpose. For a moment, he wondered if maybe all the times were on purpose, but then shook it off. That was ridiculous. Clint Barton codename Hawkeye was one of the top marksman in the world, he was part of a superhero team, and he in no way would be following Stiles of all people. It struck him then that he should be more focused on the fact that he wouldn\u2019t have found it weird if the archer was actually following him, but shrugged the thought off. With the werewolves he\u2019d grown up with, it was no surprise he\u2019d been desensitized to stalking. He glanced back at the archer one more time. It didn\u2019t hurt to admit that he wouldn\u2019t have minded, but there was no point on dwelling on it. Without further evidence, it was probably just coincidence. Stiles nearly snorted at that. Nothing in his life was ever coincidence.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nStiles knocked on Coulson's door, frown in place, staring at the file in his hands. When Coulson's voice beckoned him in, he opened the door, looking up from his file to see Coulson behind his desk, writing in a report. He stopped and looked up when Stiles approached the desk, brow rising with the unasked question.\u00a0\n\u201cI think someone's been tampering with some of the files.\u201d he said without further prompt, and that had both of Coulson's eyebrows shooting up.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you have any evidence of this?\u201d and Stiles shook his head, frustrated.\u00a0\n\u201cSee, that's the thing. I think they're not only changing the electronic files, but switching out the paper ones.\u201d he offered the file in his hand and Coulson took it.\u00a0\n\u201cI read that file yesterday, it's about the toxin levels taken from the water near a suspected AIM base. But here's the thing \u2013 I could have sworn there were low levels of radiation in that file yesterday because I sent a request to have the elementary school down the road tested to make sure those kids are safe.\u201d that had Coulson looking up.\u00a0\n\u201cThere's nothing here about any levels of radiation.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. But I know it was there. Otherwise I wouldn't have put in the request because it would be a waste of resources. That's the other thing. The request disappeared too. I checked for the record of it, and there is none. And this isn't the only file. The last couple incidents relating to AIM, everything still under open investigation that is, things seem to be changing. And I didn't notice at first \u2013 well I did but I assumed it was people correcting their work you know \u2013 but with this? Someone had to manually remove my request, and there's no reason anyone should have done that. If the reports were wrong and the test wasn't necessary it would have just been denied not erased.\u201d and Coulson was inclined to agree.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you remember what the levels of radiation were?\u201d and Stiles shook his head, obviously frustrated.\u00a0\n\u201cNo. I know they were low, but just high enough that regular exposure could cause a problem.\u201d then he paused, taking a deep breath before meeting Coulson's gaze head on. \u201cI know you hand picked this team, but somebody in that room is tampering with files. These were locked in my desk which means somebody had to pick that before they could access it to switch it out. But I reviewed the camera feed and didn't see anything. Maybe they're a really good hacker \u2013 maybe we need better security. But I want that radiation test for that school. And I want whoever is messing with my files out of there.\u201d Coulson didn't respond right away, instead his gaze flickered past Stiles just as the hairs on the back of his neck stood.\u00a0\n\u201cI'll have Stark take a look at the video. If someone's messed with it, he'll know, no matter how good they are.\u201d and it was Clint's voice who cut in. Stiles glanced back, almost wary. Ever since the incident with Ward in the hall he\u2019d been seeing a lot of the archer, but that didn't make the favour a bit out of character. Then again, this was a raid he'd be on if it turned out to actually be AIM, so maybe it wasn't so strange after all.\u00a0\n\u201cGreat. In the mean time, I need more samples. And I'd like the results sent directly to you, sir. If it goes through that room, I don't currently trust it not to be altered. Plus, that can tell us if it's someone from the lab or not.\u201d Coulson just nodded.\n\u201cI'll put the request through personally. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention.\u201d Stiles gave another nod before rushing off. He had his own ways to find out who was behind this.\n\u00a0\nThe two men watched the younger agent stalk off before Clint turned back to face Phil's desk. Phil just shook his head.\n\u201cIf you keep appearing whenever he's here he's going to notice.\u201d his handler said, and Clint made a face at him.\u00a0\n\u201cThat would mean he'd have to know that I wasn't here the rest of the time.\u201d Phil gave him a look to tell him just what he thought of that argument, but Clint just flopped onto the couch along the wall of his office.\n\u201cI would rather you didn't stalk my agents.\u201d\n\u201cI'm not stalking him \u2013 just keeping an eye on him.\u201d\n\u201cYou saw for yourself that he's perfectly capable of taking care of himself.\u201d Clint grinned.\u00a0\n\u201cTwice. I showed Nat the clips. Even she was impressed.\u201d Coulson just shook his head.\u00a0\n\u201cWas she equally as impressed with your stalking habits?\u201d Clint just vaulted off the couch.\u00a0\n\u201cI'm not stalking anyone.\u201d he tossed back, even while remembering Nat's gentle reminder; don't just follow him \u2013 speak to him. She, if anyone, understood why that was difficult for him; it was easier to just watch from a distance. That way, the thing he cared about wouldn't be damaged. Clint shook the thoughts from his head, ducking into an empty corridor before pulling himself into the vents. It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t spoken to Stiles, in fact, he\u2019d gone out of his way to do just that, but he\u2019d kept it casual - more than casual. He scowled. He\u2019d been telling the truth, he was just keeping an eye on the other man; after all he'd heard some of the offers and threats made by other agents who wanted his job. Plus, Agent Stiles Stilinski really was good at his job, and his work had a certain flare to it. Sooner rather than later, the others were going to want to meet the man behind organizing their intel so it was best to watch anonymously now while he could. He couldn't help but scowl again when the thought crossed his mind; it did sound a bit stalker-ish.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was supposed to be Stiles' day off but he was starting to realize that he wouldn't really get days off. He was running through the halls in his street clothes, scrambling around corners to get to the analyst room he worked in. He slid around another corner and only just managed to dodge around Clint who blinked at him in surprise.\u00a0\n\"Isn't today your day off?\" Clint asked, automatically turning to catch up.\u00a0\n\"I was reading a thing yesterday and something caught my attention but I couldn't figure out what.\" He'd reached the room then, running to his desk. \"And then I realized.\" He was flipping through the files earning more than a few curious glances. \"Aha!\" He pulled out a slim little file from halfway in the pile and when he opened it Clint saw it was only a single page.\u00a0\n\"What's that?\" He couldn't help but ask, stepping in closer to read it over his shoulder. It was a summary of a medical report - an autopsy to be exact, and Clint still didn't understand the fuss.\u00a0\n\"This report makes no sense.\" Stiles was saying, handing it to Clint so he could boot up his computer. \"Because if this were actually done the way it's supposed to be done, why weren't any of the organs catalogued? Where have they gone?\" And now that Clint knew what he was looking for he read over the summary again.\u00a0\n\"Do you think they weren't removed?\" And Stiles spun from where he'd been jotting info down on a pad of paper, ripping off the top sheet.\n\"I think he's still alive.\" And that had Clint taking off after Stiles when the younger man bolted.\u00a0\n\"What are you going to do? Tell Coulson?\" And Stiles snorted.\u00a0\n\"Going to find him. You coming?\" And Clint only had time to decide to go or not and so he kept on Stiles' heels.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nClint found himself on the morgue level of a hospital, gun in hand as he followed Stiles through the halls. They were too quiet - and Clint had noticed more than one creepy bloodstain on walls and doors. If Clint didn't know better he'd think they were hunting zombies. Come to think of it - maybe he didn't know better.\u00a0\nThey reached the entrance to the morgue and Stiles pushed in without even a glance inside to see if it was dangerous. Clint cursed before ducking in after him. For a moment, he couldn't see Stiles and the panic shot through him. Where'd he gone? Then he heard the soft murmuring of his voice and he followed the sound, gun still up as he looked around the morgue and his stomach rolled. It looked like every zombie movie he'd ever seen - blood and pieces of what had been people strewn about. He looked at a leg sticking out from behind a table and saw what were definitely teeth marks on the ragged edges of what had been the guys calf. That's when Stiles came into sight. He was crouched low, hands out in front of him in surrender, but his expression was calm as he spoke.\u00a0\n\"We aren't here to hurt you. I'm here to help you.\" Clint edged forward, wanting to see just who Stiles was talking to and when he caught sight of them his stomach rolled again. It was a kid of probably 15 crouched in a corner, and it was clear he was what had been eating everyone else in the place, but what freaked out Clint the most was the fact that the kids eyes were flat white, no variations for pupils, and his teeth were serrated like a sharks. He was covering from Stiles though, low whimpers coming from his throat. \"I'm here to help you.\" Stiles said again, and though Clint had been silent, Stiles' gaze flickered to him in warning. It was a demand he didn't shoot. Clint kept his gun out but not aimed and Stiles' gaze turned back to the kid. \"We need to get you out of here. Will you come with me? I'll make sure you have food, I promise. I'll take care of you.\" He offered his hand and though the kid was still whimpering, a shaking hand reached out towards Stiles. It was in that moment that Clint realized the kid was scared, and it had him pointing the gun at the floor. Movement flashed in the corner of his eye and he barely had time to duck the metal pipe swinging at his head even as the shouted \"No!\" Met his ears. He twisted without hesitation, gun coming up, but the person who'd swung had moved too, pipe coming down on Clint's shoulder. His hand released it\u2019s hold involuntarily but he threw himself forward in a roll, coming up with the gun in his other hand, firing off a warning shot that forced the other to take cover.\u00a0\n\"You can't take him!\" Came the near hysterical shout from his attacker, and Clint frowned. \"I made him - he's mine - you can't have him!\" Clint spared a glance back at Stiles but the younger man was no longer in sight and neither was the kid. He squashed down the feeling of panic and focused on the man hiding from him.\u00a0\n\"You made him like this?\" He asked, and even he could hear the rage in his voice.\u00a0\n\"I helped him evolve. I can help you do the same.\" The syringe plunged into his neck and he spun, gun up and pointed, and fired two shots into the mans chest. The man stumbled back before collapsing, blood spreading across his shirt. As always, it had been the perfect shot. He snatched up the syringe the man had dropped and found it empty.\u00a0\n\"Fuck.\"\n\"Clint! Are you okay?\" And that was Stiles again, walking up to him, expression pinched with worry with the boy trailing behind him, hand linked with Stiles'. Clint turned to answer and that's when the world started to spin. Stiles caught him before he'd even realized he was falling and his limbs were starting to go numb. \"What happened?\" Clint rolled his head, baring his neck where he'd been injected. Stiles' skin felt cool against his skin and he heard Stiles curse before his fingers curled around Clint's neck and for the first time in his life the gesture felt safe rather than threatening. The touch of Stiles' skin was so cool it tingled, and his vision was blacking out as the tingle spread through his whole body.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nClint woke up in the hospital. He couldn't hear anything - and he realized his hearing aids weren't in. He looked around, disoriented, and found Natasha sitting next to his bed, watching him with an impassive expression.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \"Where's Stiles?\" Were the first words out of his mouth, and Natasha said nothing at first, expression not changing, and it had something painful tightening in Clint's chest. She moved then, and he recognized his hearing aids in her hands, letting her slip them over his ears before he clicked them on.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \"Stiles is fine.\" She said finally, and Clint relaxed not having realized he'd tensed. \"He's sleeping off his injuries a few rooms over.\" And that had Clint surging up.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \"What injuries?\" And it was Natasha shooting to her feet, standing right in front of him so he couldn't rise without pushing her that stopped him from rushing down the hall to the other mans room. Her expression was neutral again when he looked up, but he knew she wasn't pleased.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \"When he dragged you in he was bleeding from multiple lacerations to his chest and upper arms. Defensive wounds. From covering you.\" That had Clint's eyes narrowing - how could she possibly know that? She read him perfectly. \"I know because he's also got bruising alone his side that matches your tactical vest.\" That had Clint scowling.\u00a0\n\"I want to see him.\" But Natasha didn't move. We also found two bodies. One shot with your weapon. The other -\" her expression faltered then, but only to those who knew her. It was a slight tightening around her mouth but it was telling.\u00a0\n\"The kid?\" Natasha nodded.\u00a0\n\"Stiles had lost too much blood hauling you in to be lucid when questioned.\" And that had Clint grimacing. He stood despite the fact that it pushed him into her, and she lifted a brow in surprise despite the fact that she stepped back.\u00a0\n\"I want to see him.\" He said firmly and this time Natasha didn't answer, instead leading the way to the door. She lead him down the hall and into a room 4 doors down from his own. He ignored her stare as he pushed into the room and he was next to the bed before he realized he'd moved forward. Stiles was asleep, eyelashes black against nearly translucent skin. Clint could see the bandaging around his arms and winced.\u00a0\n\"I don't know what the kid was. All I know is Stiles came running in this morning?\" He looked to Natasha to confirm that was all the time that had passed and she nodded. \"Because one of the reports had been off. He was right, it was way off. The autopsy report was missing anything about the organs. Stiles thought the guy was still alive and he was heading out before even thinking of calling backup. I followed.\"\u00a0\n\"To the morgue.\" Clint nodded.\u00a0\n\"The place was a mess. Right out of a horror movie, Nat.\" And she nodded again, both confirming and a prompt to continue. \"I followed him all the way in and found him crouching in front of this kid - and the kid? He was terrified Nat. He was obviously what had done that shit to those people, but he was fucking cowering from Stiles who just crouched there hands out telling the kid we were just there to help.\" He looked back to Stiles then, couldn't help himself from brushing the tips of his fingers over the back of Stiles' hand. \"Thats when the other guy showed up. Must have been the M.E.. He came at me with a pipe - admitted that he did that to the kid - turned him into that. Said he helped him evolve.\" Clint could feel the sneer on his face. \"He came up behind me, got me with a syringe of something - said it would help me evolve too - and then I shot him. Two hits to the chest.\" He tapped over his own heart. \"He went down. Last I saw, Stiles had the kid by the hand, was leading him over when I went down. Whatever was in that syringe knocked me out.\"\n\"We can't find any trace of what you were injected with.\" Natasha told him bluntly, and now he could see the impassive mask was to cover her worry. \"You were unconscious but there was no way for us to find out why or how.\" For a second, all Clint could remember was how when everything had started to blur, Stiles' touch had tingled - but there was no way he'd somehow expelled whatever Clint had been injected with.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it was, Nat. Best I can say is whatever that kid was, when I went down it turned on Stiles.\u201d beside him, Natasha nodded, her impassive mask cracking as she too stared at the man in the bed.\u00a0\n\u201cHe fought hard to protect you. From what we found in that morgue, he almost died for it.\u201d and Clint stared at her in disbelief. Understanding where it stemmed from, she continued. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have any further injuries, and there\u2019s almost a ring of blood around where you went down. He let himself get hurt to cover you instead of fighting full strength and moving out from between you and it. He limited himself so that you wouldn\u2019t be vulnerable.\u201d There was a fierceness to her gaze now as she turned to him, an anger, at both him and at Stiles. \u201cI can count on one hand the people who would do that for me, and you\u2019re one of them. Don\u2019t let this be for nothing.\u201d she looked at Stiles once more. \u201cBe cautious. When his injuries were wrapped, he panicked to the point of unconsciousness. He\u2019ll be disoriented.\u201d and with that she stepped in, pressing a kiss to his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re alright.\u201d and swept out the door, leaving him alone. Looking over at where Stiles lay on the bed, Clint settled into the chair next to him, ready to wait.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nThe ball hit the wall and bounced back to his hand for the 312th time when Clint caught movement out of the corner of his eye, and he dropped the ball to the floor as he leaned forward, watching Stiles carefully. His eyelids flickered again and he sucked in a breath of relief. He was waking up. Even as he had the thought, Stiles\u2019 eyes fluttered open, and confused whiskey eyes stared at the ceiling.\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re okay. You\u2019re in SHIELD medical. Apparently you took quite the beating covering my ass.\u201d and Stiles snorted out a laugh even as his gaze slipped to Clint, and now the archer could see the drug haze in Stiles\u2019 eyes. They\u2019d put him on the good stuff, it meant his injuries really were bad.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice ass.\u201d was the flippant reply, and Clint blinked in surprise before giving a bark of laughter. It hadn\u2019t been the response he\u2019d expected, but he\u2019d take it.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah well, thanks for keeping it, and me, in one piece.\u201d Stiles lifted a hand to wave him off, the motion sloppy, but then he froze, eyes caught on the bandages on his arm. Clint immediately moved forward, made sure Stiles looked at him.\n\u201cStiles, I need you to focus on me. They had to wrap your injuries, okay? But we can take them off, replace them with a compress.\u201d and he watched Stiles swallow back his panic.\n\u201cCompress. Yes. Good. Do that.\u201d and Clint hurried over to the side of the room, listening as the heart monitor slowly began to pick up as Stiles\u2019 panic grew. Rather than grab the scissors, he pulled his pocket knife from his pocket, slicing open the bandages on Stiles\u2019 chest and revealing the nasty gashes below that were already starting to heal themselves back together. It made Clint feel better that at least these ones weren\u2019t too deep. The moment the bandages were no longer wrapping his torso, Stiles let out a breath of relief, calm as could be as Clint pressed the compress over the wounds, taping it down.\n\u201cDone.\u201d he gathered the old bandage, tossing it out and washing his hands. \u201cLet\u2019s agree to never do that again, okay?\u201d and now Stiles huffed out a laugh.\n\u201cDone.\u201d\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nHe'd gone home for a week. One week, that was it, and in that time, everything seemed to go to shit. Stiles flinched as he finished wrapping his ribs before pulling on his uniform. He took a moment to breathe through the discomfort. By wrapping his own ribs, he knew where the bandage came from, knew it wasn\u2019t from a thousand year old fox demon trying to steal his body, but sometimes it still made him want to throw up from anxiety. First, he'd had to delay his flight out because some intel had been rubbing him the wrong way despite the fact that everyone else cleared it but he hadn't backed down even when Coulson had gained that slight narrowing of impatience around his eyes. But Stiles had found the problem; and it had been invaluable because it had shown them a toxicity level that should have been read in the air all along but had somehow been cloaked and it had allowed the team going in (and by now he should just get used to saying the Avengers) to don the proper masks so that none of them were gravelly injured. As soon as the issue was cleared up, he'd hightailed it out of there and onto the plane that Coulson had switched him onto (bless his favouritism), and made it back to California only a few hours late. The visit itself had started out great. The whole pack had met him at the airport and it had been amazing. They stayed the first night in the airport hotel, all curling together in a room, basking in each others presence, the wolves scent marking Stiles as one of their own once more. Then, the next day they'd travelled back to Beacon Hills where his Dad was waiting with more hugs. It was the best welcome ever. Of course, nothing good could ever last in his life because barely 2 days later an\u00a0omega\u00a0had blown through town and so of course Stiles had ended up thrown into a tree and nearly eaten when the thing ambushed him. He'd managed to fight back \u2013 even stabbed it through the torso with a fallen tree branch, subduing it enough for the pack to get there and finish it off, but it left him with 4 bruised ribs and a scrape along his side, not to mention his tender shoulder. He'd barely even started to heal when he'd flown back and now he was cursing his luck because he worked with super spies, how was he supposed to keep his injuries hidden?\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d the question came in the form of a familiar archer that he\u2019d come to realize really was just following him around, and had Stiles wondering if he actually had a job or just liked spooking younger agents. Said archer fell into step with him as he headed for the room he worked in, and Stiles had to resist shrugging since he knew the motion would make him wince.\u00a0\n\u201cNothing \u2013 was practicing a flip and ended up landing wrong.\u201d he lied easily, and the archer only paused a second before speaking again.\u00a0\n\u201cHow was the trip home?\u201d and the question sounded almost stilted, and Stiles couldn't help but snicker internally at the thought that it was because the other agents were way to terrified of the archer to try for small talk.\u00a0\n\u201cGood. My dad had almost managed to bribe the town to serve him burgers again but I visited just in time. Back to turkey bacon for him. And my friends are doing pretty well too. It was good to see them.\u201d he answered honestly, because why not?\u00a0\n\u201cTurkey bacon?\u201d and the question was accompanied by a grimace.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, it tastes just fine. Plus dad's got heart problems. Whatever I can do to keep him healthy longer, I'll do.\u201d and Clint could understand the sentiment even if he hadn't felt it for his own father. He felt the difference before he saw her and could only relax at the feeling of Natasha's presence.\u00a0\n\u201cYou're Coulson's new favourite.\u201d her voice was soft but Clint could hear the challenge in it. Apparently, so could Stiles.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn't realize his favouring junior agents threatened you at all; thought you supers were more secure in your relationships than that.\u201d the words earned the younger agent a smirk and when Natasha met Clint's gaze, he could read her easily. I can see why you like him.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are.\u201d she all but purred, and Stiles actually rolled his eyes like he was used to that kind of thing.\u00a0\n\u201cGreat. As nice as this is though, I really do have to get to work, so-\u201d with that he hurried off, and Clint didn't miss Natasha's critical expression.\n\u201cThat injury isn't from a flip.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d that earned him a raised eyebrow and he shrugged. \u201cThe chances of a flip injuring him like that are basically impossible. Not with the way he moves. That's like full round bruising.\u201d Natasha nodded.\u00a0\n\u201cIf I didn't know better, I'd say someone hurt him.\u201d and Clint couldn't deny it cause he knew the same thing. But they'd both seen him fight Ward, twice - he was good - really good. For someone to actually deal that kind of damage meant they have to be better, and that put them closer to Clint and Natasha's level than Clint was comfortable with.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you say we look into his trip back home?\u201d Clint said then, and Natasha was already walking towards Coulson's office. Clint was quick to follow.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you both start stalking him, I'm going to have to write you up.\u201d Phil said the moment they entered his office, and while Clint pouted, Natasha simply lifted a brow.\n\u201cHave you seen him since he's returned?\u201d Natasha asked instead, and Phil frowned.\n\u201cNo, should I have?\u201d\n\u201cHe's injured. Fairly severely. And he lied about the cause.\u201d Natasha informed him, and it had Phil's frown deepening.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did he say happened?\u201d\n\u201cThat he landed wrong on a flip.\u201d Clint cut in, and that had the expected reaction. \u201cYeah, you'd think he'd know better than to lie to an acrobat about that, but apparently not.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you think caused it?\u201d\n\u201cThe question is, who.\u201d Natasha responded, and Phil finally stood.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\n\u201cAccess to his file. Whatever happened, it was when he went home. I want his medical records.\u201d Natasha stated, but Phil looked at Clint. Clint looked right back.\n\u201cI agree with Nat. Stiles can take on Ward. For someone to do that kind of damage -\u201d\n\u201cThey're probably on your playing field.\u201d Phil agreed. \u201cI'll get you his file, but there's surprisingly little in it.\u201d and that had both assassins exchanging a glance.\n\u201cYou didn't find that odd?\u201d and Phil shot her a look for that.\n\u201cOf course I did. But there's actually surprisingly good firewalls around most of the info regarding any residence while they were minors in that town. Without pulling Tony in, we don't have access to most of the information.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think they had something to hide?\u201d and Phil shrugged.\u00a0\n\u201cThere's been a rise in this sort of thing \u2013 especially involving the information of minors. I wouldn't be surprised if Beacon Hills was just a bit ahead of the game. But if the two of you find anything, I want to hear it.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d Clint agreed with a lazy salute, already heading out the door. The moment he was out of sight, Phil looked to Natasha who shrugged.\u00a0\n\u201cHe's had to wrap his ribs, I could see the edge of the bandage. I understand his worry. I'll tell you if anything happens.\u201d when Phil nodded, she followed her partner out, and Phil gave a sigh before heading to the door as well. It looked like he had an agent to check up on.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was his first day not having his ribs wrapped since the Omega incident and Stiles had almost forgotten what it was like to not have to use effort to breathe. He took deep breaths now, enjoying the fresh air on his walk to work. That is, until the town car pulled up beside him. The door swung open and Stiles was already tense for a fight; what he wasn't prepared for was Tony Stark to fold out of the car, staring at him from behind dark sunglasses that could only hide so much of the piercing gaze.\u00a0\n\u201cSo you're the new protege; you've been the talk of the town.\u201d Stiles could only shrug, only partially put out.\u00a0\n\u201cThat's apparently a theme lately.\u201d was his response, and it earned him a smirk.\n\u201cCome on. I'm giving you a ride. I have to see Coulson anyways.\u201d for a minute, Stiles considered arguing, but he'd heard enough about Stark to know arguing was futile, especially over something like this.\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, the tower is in the complete opposite direction of my apartment. Not only that, but this is not a main road. Is my phone bugged?\u201d\n\u201cShould it be?\u201d Tony asked first, before waving a hand in gesture. \u201cNo, that would be too easy. I had Jarvis triangulate your signal. Though I hear your uniforms are all tagged.\u201d the thought made Stiles grimace though it didn't surprise him. Stiles only let a beat of silence pass before breaking it.\u00a0\n\u201cso, why are you here?\u201d\n\u201cCap was impressed with the detail of your reports. Not that he new it was you \u2013 but I read through the files and they all had the same style and so I looked into it. I found you.\u201d Stiles only had time to hum in reply before Stark was speaking again. \u201cAnd I didn't expect you. You've got an eye for detail that I didn't see coming. And Coulson usually hates new recruits but with you \u2013 when I asked he actually acknowledged you. That never happens. You're smarter than most of the other agents too.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\u00a0 Was Stiles' dry response, and it earned him a smirk.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I hear you're nearly as badass as our assassins.\u201d Stiles only just managed not to role his eyes. \u201cI also hear that the guy you fought against is one of the better agents and you still knocked him on his ass on multiple occasions.\u201d Stiles knew better than to argue at this point. \u201cSo I decided I had to meet you before anyone else did.\u201d that had Stiles working to cover his shock. Clearly Stark didn't know that he'd already met his two assassins. It appeared though that Stark was finally looking for a response.\u00a0\n\u201cRight. Well. Thanks, I guess?\u201d it earned him a shrug.\n\u201cI couldn't just let you walk. Not with freshly healing ribs.\u201d Stiles immediately tensed, wary in a way he hadn't been before.\u00a0\n\u201cThat's not creepy at all.\u201d he deadpanned, but Stark just lifted a brow.\u00a0\n\u201cWas that supposed to be a secret?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but doesn't exactly tell me how you know.\u201d\n\u201cJarvis scanned you when you got in the car.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRight.\u201d Stiles reached for the handle but Stark just rolled his eyes, the car stopping as he got out the other side.\u00a0\n\u201cWe're here.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. Thanks for the ride.\u201d\n\u201cYou spend too much time with Coulson.\u201d Stark said decidedly. \u201cThat's why you're so uninspired by my presence. That will have to change. After work you're coming to the tower. Happy will be here to pick you up.\u201d Stiles was about to argue when Stark steamrolled over him. \u201cThe whole team will be there.\u201d And Stiles was nodding before he even realized it because Clint was going to be there. Shit. He'd been developing a crush and didn't even realize it. Shit. Before he could even change his mind, Stark and his car were gone.\u00a0\n\u201cShit.\u201d\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nThe moment Tony walked into the common room with a smirk on his face, Clint knew something was up. He wasn't the only one, because before Tony could even speak, Steve had stood up.\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d and his tone was exasperated. Tony had the gall to look offended.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn't do anything wrong.\u201d he shot back. \u201cI just invited the new agent to visit after he was finished with Coulson for the day. So you could all meet the face behind all the reports.\u201d And that had Clint's full attention. Stiles would be coming to the tower? \u201cI told him he'd be meeting the whole team so your presence is required.\u201d Tony announced, and though Clint shrugged under his gaze, he had every intention of being there. He rolled to his feet, heading for the door despite Tony's protests.\u00a0\n\u201cI'll be back in time.\u201d he muttered, waving Tony off, and he left to the sound of Steve reprimanding the genius for bullying the new agent into seeing them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClint found Stiles at his desk and ignored the looks of the other 6 agents currently in the room as he made his way over. When he settled on the edge of the agents desk, arms crossed in front of his chest, he then turned his gaze on the other agents until they all looked away. Once that was done, he returned his attention to the agent at hand.\u00a0\n\u201cTony ambushed you into coming to the tower I hear.\u201d he said softly now that he knew the other agents were minding their own business, and Stiles shook his head, wry smile on his face.\u00a0\n\u201cI was sort of agreeing before I knew what I was agreeing to. He was starting to draw attention.\u201d\n\u201cTony does that.\u201d\n\u201cSo I've noticed.\u201d and Stiles pushed back from his desk a bit then, tossing a shrewd look in Clint's direction. \u201cIs that why you're here?\u201d Clint shrugged, though it was exactly why he was there.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you going to come?\u201d\n\u201cHe was pretty insistent I meet the whole team.\u201d Stiles responded, resting his chin on his chest as he slouched behind the desk, though he looked up at Clint through the spikey ends of his hair falling in his face from being run through to many times. He needed a haircut. \u201cAre you going to be there?\u201d Stiles found himself asking, \u201cOr is this your way of telling me you won't be present for my apparent kidnapping.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI live at the tower.\u201d Clint said, as if that cleared it all up, and Stiles just rolled his eyes.\n\u201cI'll take that as your attendance confirmed then.\u201d he mocked before shifting his weight so he could all but throw himself forward, arms resting on his desk, face hidden against them.\n\u201cStark's going to make my life very difficult if I don't show up and turn down his invitation. He doesn\u2019t seem the type to handle rejection well. But I've got a ton of work.\u201d\n\u201cIt's no big. Tonight's pizza and movie night anyways.\u201d and the words seemed to perk Stiles up just like Clint had hoped they would.\u00a0\n\u201cFree pizza on Tony Stark's credit card? How could I turn that down?\u201d the words earned him a smirk. But his excitement faltered slightly as he thought more about it. \u201cIs there a dress code? Are there rules about this sort of thing?\u201d he felt his pulse quicken and wanted to curse himself. Why on earth would Tony Stark invite him around to anything except maybe to embarrass him? Even if he was good at his job, the billionaire wasn't exactly known for his kind personality, public humiliation was kind of his game. And yet if Coulson really had vouched for him that might mean the invitation was genuine and what the hell was he supposed to talk to superheroes about? His pulse was racing now, his breathing getting erratic and Stiles didn't realize he'd all but induced a panic attack until it was too late. Why now? Why in front of Clint of all people? And about this of all things? Before he'd even realized that the agent had moved, Clint had him up and away from his desk and in an empty office, the door barred from anyone else entering as Stiles gasped for breath.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, just breathe with me, okay? In and out.\u201d Clint said, voice smooth as if speaking to a spooked animal, and for a moment Stiles felt like that was exactly what he was as he gasped for breath. When he finally collapsed, not having panicked but the anxiety of the attack stressing him out anyways, he found himself sitting on the floor with Clint.\u00a0\n\u201cShit.\u201d and Clint huffed out a laugh at that. Little did he know that it was becoming the limit of Stiles' verbal abilities for the day.\u00a0\n\u201cYou good?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Hasn't happened in a while. Social interaction isn't exactly my strong suit.\u201d and that earned him a shrug.\n\u201cYou're not so bad. You talk to me after all.\u201d and Stiles couldn't help but wheeze out a laugh at that.\u00a0\n\u201cYou followed me around. Talking was inevitable.\u201d he met Clint's gaze, unsure of the reaction he'd get for calling the archer out on his near stalking, but Clint just shrugged again.\u00a0\n\u201cObviously it's a good thing I did or you'd be dealing with Stark on your own.\u201d and that had Stiles shuddering.\u00a0\n\u201cI'm definitely not complaining.\u201d and he realized that may have come off a little bit more suggestive than he'd thought. He could all but feel his ears burning. \u201cHow much would Coulson hurt me if I went home?\u201d Because Stiles was beginning to feel woozy. He needed to be home, and maybe to call Scott. Or Isaac. Someone he could call and who would be fine with talking but also fine with just sitting on the phone in silence. Definitely Isaac. God, he missed his pack. Rather than answer, Clint was on his feet, offering a hand to pull Stiles up and steadying him when he was wobbly on his feet.\u00a0\n\u201cStark was planning on kidnapping you anyways. Blame him.\u201d Stiles gave a smile, letting Clint lead him out of the building and shove him in a taxi. He was surprised when Clint climbed in the taxi as well, giving his address as if he'd done it a hundred times before.\u00a0\n\u201cUm-\u201d Stiles began, but the look Clint gave him shut him up until they were out of the cab and in Stiles apartment. Stiles just fidgeted around nervously before just shaking his head and hurrying into the bedroom to change. Once he was more comfortable in jeans, a tshirt, and a plaid button up, he went back out to find Clint on his couch, flipping through one of his myth text books.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was a lot more interesting than it looks.\u201d Stiles promised, flopping down onto his couch as well, glancing over at the book. \u201cThat was a discussion class. We spent most of it arguing. It was great.\u201d he relaxed them, letting himself drift as Clint continued to slowly flip through the book. An hour had passed before he realized they were still just sitting there and he shifted, blinking out of his daze, stretching out. \u201cAre we supposed to be there at any specific time?\u201d\n\u201cPizzas usually ordered around 7.\u201d\n\u201cRight. Okay. Um -\u201d and Clint just tossed him a look to shut up.\n\u201cWhy don't you go lay down until we have to go? I'll just take advantage of your cable services.\u201d and the look Clint was giving him brooked no argument so Stiles just got up and headed to the bedroom, flopping down on his bed. He realized he didn't feel the need to call home anymore \u2013 feeling perfectly secure now, especially considering who his company in the other room was. He still picked up his phone though, and still dialled Isaac, but it was nice to know it wasn't necessary.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClint hadn't been able to resist going into Stiles' bedroom to wake the other man up. Part of him had just wanted to see the other when his sharp gaze wasn't going to turn on him at any moment, and the other part enjoyed the trust Stiles had displayed, falling asleep only a room away from someone with skills like his. As he moved closer to where Stiles had curled into a ball under the covers, he realized his phone was in his hand, a call in progress. Frowning, he moved closer, and it only took a glance to see the caller ID read Isaac. He wondered who Isaac was \u2013 if it was a regular thing for Stiles to fall asleep on the phone with the other, and couldn't help the jealousy that reared it's ugly head. Even as he glanced back at the phone, he realized the call had ended, but rather than focus on that fact he moved forward, placing a gentle hand on Stiles shoulder to wake him. Stiles reacted immediately, jerking away from the touch and all but launching himself away from where Clint stood, breathing heavy as he shook his head to clear it before focusing on Clint with a frown. As soon as the recognition clicked behind his eyes, the embarrassment flooded forward.\u00a0\n\u201cShit. Sorry. If I fall asleep alone in a room I react a bit violently to a foreign presence waking me up.\u201d and that was something Clint could understand.\u00a0\n\u201cNo worries. Just thought you'd want to know it was time to go.\u201d Stiles just blinked at him a moment, and Clint took that second to appreciate how he looked, sleep mussed and confused, but also once more completely at ease with Clint there in his space.\u00a0\n\u201cRight. Okay. I should \u2013 change?\u201d Clint shrugged at that, eyes tracking the movement of Stiles' hands as one tugged on his shirt, covering the sliver of skin that had become visible between his shirt and his jeans, and the other that was running through his hair.\u00a0\n\u201cNobody will notice either way.\u201d he waited though, waited to see what Stiles would do, and watched the indecision war over his features before settling to a decision.\n\u201cNobody will notice.\u201d he agreed, since after all, he really had only just put the shirt on a few hours ago. He moved back around the bed, grabbing his phone off the bed and pocketing it as if nothing was the matter, and Clint couldn't help the thought it gave him; it meant the calls were a regular thing.\u00a0\n\u201cYour phone was on.\u201d he found himself saying, and watched Stiles' expression carefully. There was a flicker of surprise before it settled on recognition.\n\u201cYeah, I was talking to Isaac. He's a friend from back home. We grew up together.\u201d he paused a moment, obviously choosing his words carefully. \u201cWe both had it a bit rough. In one way or another. So we've always tried to be there for each other \u2013 in the rough moments. Once you find someone who understands \u2013 well.\u201d\n\u201cI get it.\u201d Clint cut in, because he did, and he could tell it was hard for Stiles to talk about. He couldn't help but wonder if one day the other man would volunteer the information without looking quite so pained. He wondered if it was possible for himself to go long enough without ruining something for Stiles to reach that level of comfort with him. \u201cThat's me and Nat.\u201d and Stiles nodded, offering a smile of understanding. As Clint hailed a cab, he couldn't help but plead with the universe to not let this fuck up for once in his damn life.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe tower was almost exactly as Stiles had expected it and he was almost a little disappointed. Not that he could have expected what he was seeing, per se, but the level of opulence, the sleek modern designs, none of them were surprising given what he knew of Stark, and that was almost disappointing.\u00a0\n\u201cNothing impresses you.\u201d was Tony's greeting, even as it was a complaint, and Stiles could only give a sheepish grin, feeling self conscious now that he was there.\u00a0\n\u201cGiven your reputation, it's not exactly a surprise.\u201d he offered weakly, and the response earned him a laugh from none other than Steve Rogers who came forward to offer his hand, giving a firm handshake in welcome.\u00a0\n\u201cDon't mind him. He's always trying to show off and he gets all bent out of shape when it doesn't work out exactly how he wants it. Come on in. What do you like on your pizza?\u201d\n\u201cUh bacon. And pineapple. And whatever else as long as there's no anchovies.\u201d\n\u201cYou're in luck. Tony banned any fish product on pizza last month.\u201d offered a voice he recognized, and Stiles turned to see Natasha stroll over to the couches, settling down comfortably. \u201cThere was a bit of an incident.\u201d she concluded with a smirk, and Stiles just nodded dumbly, unsure of where this easy level of comfort from all of them had come from. He couldn't help but glance over at Clint and as if sensing his discomfort, the archer was there, hand on his back leading him to the couch. He half pushed him onto the couch next to Natasha, dropping onto his other side, and smirked at the squeak of surprise it elicited.\u00a0\n\u201cI like pineapple.\u201d he added, stretching an arm across the back of the couch where Stiles was sitting, and ignoring the knowing look it earned him from Natasha.\u00a0\n\u201cJarvis?\u201d\n\u201cRight away, Captain Rogers. The usual pizza order has been placed with the addition of a large pizza with bacon and pineapple.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGreat. Jarvis \u2013 where's Bruce? He needs to meet our new agent.\u201d Tony announced, before looking towards Steve. \u201cIs Sam coming?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHe should be here soon.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. That's everyone but Thor. How about that?\u201d Stiles was feeling a bit of whiplash, but managed to nod along in a daze. Even as the elevator doors dinged open he found himself floundering. Before he'd had a chance to protest, Tony had pulled him to his feet, dragging him towards the doctor.\u00a0\n\u201cBruce look! It's our new agent!\u201d and the smile Bruce offered was as understanding as it was amused.\u00a0\n\u201cStiles. I go by Stiles.\u201d he cut in, offering his hand, and the doctor shook it easily.\u00a0\n\u201cDoes Coulson know that you've been appropriated?\u201d he asked mildly, and Stiles couldn't help his laugh.\u00a0\n\u201cI have a feeling that Coulson probably knew before I did.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat's the spirit!\u201d Tony agreed, clapping Stiles on the shoulder. Then he was dragging Stiles back to the couch and all but shoving him back down. It left him falling into Clint's lap, who caught him easily, shifting him back into the space beside him though Stiles didn't miss that the archer still left them in each others personal space.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nStiles woke up curled up against something solid and warm and knew it was a person before he'd even registered where he was or how he might have ended up there. He blamed the fact that his brain hadn't fully turned back on yet for snuggling into the warmth, cheek pressed against soft cotton, an arm wrapped tightly across his back, a hand resting just above his hip. It was in the moment it took to connect person to movie night that everything became crystal clear and Stiles' stiffened. He'd been invited to movie night. He'd gone with Clint. He'd ended up on the couch between him and Natasha and at some point Natasha's feet had tucked themselves under his thigh and Clint's arm had settled across his shoulders. One movie had turned into two, which had turned into three, and Stiles had had a stressful day, okay? He couldn't be blamed for dozing off against the comfortable warmth that was Clint Barton. But snuggling into it? That was a whole 'nother story. He shifted, intending on getting up, only to find the arm wound around him tightening, and he stilled as Clint shifted next to him, his other hand lifting from where it had been resting on Stiles' shoulder to scrub at his face.\u00a0\n\u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d he grumbled, and Stiles couldn't help but jerk at the words.\u00a0\n\u201cI really should \u2013 um \u2013 be \u2013 you know \u2013 going home.\u201d and then he realized what day it was and he was out of Clint's grip and across the room, heading for the elevator. \u201cWork. I'm late for work. Coulson's going to kill me.\u201d and even as Clint sat up, groggy from barely having woken up, blinking towards where Stiles had disappeared to, the other man was disappearing behind elevator doors and Clint could only scowl at them.\u00a0\n\u201cYou should tell him.\u201d the advice came in the form of Natasha, who passed him a cup of coffee, and he wasn't in the least bit surprised that it was exactly as he liked it. When Clint didn't answer, she pressed on. \u201cHe wouldn't have run away so quickly if you told him.\u201d she stated, and Clint scowled but didn't argue because she was right. He needed to tell Stiles because if he didn't that wouldn't be fair to either of them and he didn't want any confusion to pop up in the form of what he wanted from Stiles, because he wanted it all.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nA week after the movie night incident and Coulson still hadn't said anything to him for being late. He couldn't help but wonder if maybe one of the Avengers had gotten to him first, explained the situation \u2013 but then again, what situation was that? He hadn't seen Clint since that morning \u2013 not that that was surprising given the fact that almost the instant Stiles had made it into work he'd been given a file to proof before the Avengers were sent on a mission. And before he'd even been able to really have a chance to think about that morning, the Avengers were deployed and Stiles was left waiting in limbo. It was now day 6 of the mission and the team was supposed to be coming home today, but Stiles had yet to hear anything and it was starting to make him nervous. Of course, he should have known better than to think no news meant bad news. He'd only just sat down with his meal in the cafeteria when two trays slid onto the table across from him and his gaze jerked up to see Natasha and Clint, both looking no worse for wear than when they'd left, though both were dressed in extra S.H.I.E.L.D. sweats.\u00a0\n\u201cLose the uniforms again?\u201d he found himself asking, as if this was completely normal, and Natasha shrugged.\u00a0\n\u201cLaundry. That goo was more invasive than we thought it would be.\u201d Stiles just winced in sympathy. He knew those days.\u00a0\n\u201cGood thing they have readily logo-ed clothing here. Otherwise how else would you be a walking poster board for the supposedly covert operation of S.H.I.E.L.D.?\u201d the quip earned him a smirk from Natasha and a chuckle from Clint.\u00a0\n\u201cDon't let Coulson hear you say that. He's fond of the merch.\u201d\n\u201cHe is literally a walking breathing suit. Does he even know what sweats feel like?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory.\u201d Natasha deadpanned, playing along, and Stiles found himself more relaxed that he had been since before they'd all left.\n\u201cShouldn't you guys be getting some sleep?\u201d he asked then, finally noticing the dark circles under Clint's eyes, and the way Natasha held herself just a little too tense. \u201cYou've been running on reserves for the last two days or so. You need rest.\u201d\n\u201cWe wanted to check in our on favourite agent first.\u201d was Natasha's reply, and if he hadn't known better, she'd say the tone was almost flirtatious \u2013 but seeing as he did know better, Stiles could see if for the challenge that it was and knew it wasn't aimed at him.\u00a0\n\u201cSorry to tell you but Coulson doesn't eat in the cafeteria.\u201d Stiles replied innocently, feigning ignorance. \u201cI thought you guys knew each other better than this.\u201d he shook his head as if disparaging. Natasha's smirk grew wider.\n\u201cSleeping on base sucks.\u201d was Clint's response, ignoring them both, and Stiles nodded cause hey that made sense. Plus, his favourite agent deserved a bit of slack after the shit mission.\n\u201cYou guys could use my apartment. It's closer than the tower.\u201d he found himself saying, and it had both assassins looking at him with none of the amusement from earlier. Instead, there was a focus he wasn't used to having aimed on him.\u00a0\n\u201cThat's very sweet of you, Stiles.\u201d and he realized it was the first time Natasha had ever actually said his name, even as he saw how her gaze had gone soft, and there was no smile necessary to see that she did appreciate the offer. \u201cStark sent a car though. It should be here soon.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, no worries.\u201d though Stiles did feel a bit embarrassed for offering now because of course Tony Stark had sent a car for them.\u00a0\n\u201cThe tower is so far.\u201d Clint muttered mutinously into his tray and Stiles couldn't help the smile that snuck onto his expression.\u00a0\n\u201cMi casa es su casa and all that, but I gotta get back. Coulson still hasn't actually gotten mad at me about last week and I'd like to keep it that way. I know you can pick the lock but just lock up with the spare key in the kitchen when you leave if thats the route you choose.\u201d then he was off and as soon as he was gone Natasha gave Clint a violent smack to the back of the head.\n\u201cOw!\u201d he complained, scowling, but Natasha just scowled back.\u00a0\n\u201cYou're going to get hurt if you continue like this.\u201d she told him angrily, and when Clint shrugged, she smacked him over the head again. \u201cYou'll hurt him too. Talk to him.\u201d she ordered. And then she left too and Clint was left scowling into the tasteless food.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nStiles dragged himself into the apartment barely able to keep his eyes open. He'd ended up on a research binge which funny enough was actually encouraged at his place of work, but it left him drained and burnt out. He blamed that feeling on why he didn't notice right away that there was an extra pair of shoes in his front hall, or how the bedroom door that he left open when he was out was partially closed. He just stripped off his shirt, tossing it over the back of the couch, kicked off jeans by the bedroom door and grabbed the pyjama pants that were also by the door. Then he moved towards the bed which is when he finally stopped short.\n\u201cClint?\u201d the archer mumbled, rolling over which only accentuated the fact that he wasn't wearing a shirt. Was in Stiles bed, sleeping, and wasn't wearing a shirt. He realized that Clint must have actually taken him up on his offer instead of going back to the tower but now Stiles didn't know what to do.\u00a0\n\u201cStiles?\u201d was the groggy reply before he could over think things any further.\n\u201cThat's me. It's like 11pm dude.\u201d\n\u201cFuck.\u201d was the reply, rough with sleep, and there was something endearing about Clint like this. All sleep tousled and slightly confused.\u00a0\n\u201cIt's fine. I just didn't expect you to be here.\u201d\n\u201cYou invited me.\u201d was the confused response, and Stiles could only huff out a laugh.\n\u201cI know but I figured Natasha would've dragged you back with her.\u201d\n\u201cNah, she wants us to talk.\u201d and the implication had butterflies taking flight in his stomach.\u00a0\n\u201cCan talking wait till morning?\u201d Stiles asked, too tired to deal with that just yet, and Clint actually looked relieved.\n\u201cDefinitely morning.\u201d and he settled back against the pillows, eyes drifting shut again. \u201cComing?\u201d Stiles couldn't be bothered to deal with this either apparently because he crawled into the other side of the bed and settled down as well, happy to see that despite having stolen his side of the bed, he'd switched the pillows before he'd gone to sleep, leaving Stiles with his favourite pillow still under his head. Smiling, Stiles closed his eyes and let himself drift.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nStiles was woken up by his phone ringing. Loudly. He couldn't but groan, not wanting to move, but also couldn't help the curiosity that asked who could possibly be calling him at \u2013 yup it was 4am.\u00a0\n\u201c 'nore it.\u201d came the sleepy grumble behind him, the words rumbling through his back from Clint's chest. He realized then that the other man was wrapped around him like a koala. The phone stopped ringing and they both let out a breath of relief. Then Stiles' phone started ringing again, as did Clint's.\u00a0\n\u201cShit.\u201d Stiles cursed, scrambling for his phone even as Clint mimicked him, both answering their phones at nearly the same moment.\u00a0\n\u201cAgent Stilinski.\u201d and that was agent Coulson. He winced. He'd made his senior officer call twice. \u201cI need you suited up. You're going out in the field.\u201d And Stiles felt his jaw drop.\n\u201cBut sir \u2013 you always \u2013\u201d\n\u201cNot this time. You'll be part of a team doing the sweep once the Avengers have cleared the area.\u201d Stiles forced himself to swallow any doubts.\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d\n\u201cGood. You have 15 minutes.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d he repeated before hanging up, feeling shell shocked.\n\u201cI've got a mission.\u201d Clint said without preamble as he dressed.\n\u201cI know.\u201d Something in his voice must have tipped the archer off because he looked over sharply. \u201cI'm coming too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nStiles sat in the back of a truck, staring at screens showing him all the info of the area including all live feeds watching the boarders. He had a comm in his ear, the chatter of the Avengers quiet but discernible. Something was bothering him \u2013 and he knew without a doubt that something wasn't quite right. Why have feeds that created a perfect perimeter of the area? Literally perfect \u2013 not a single inch of the several mile radius was not covered by a camera. But why? He knew there was supposed to be intel here, but what kind? And wouldn't the people who were hiding it know better than to think they wouldn't be able to hack their cameras? Not only that, but, why had they sent him into the field rather than Coulson? He was so senior to Stiles it was almost embarrassing, and he was always, always, the man in the field with the Avengers. So why change that now? The high pitched wailing of something mechanical charging had the other three agents in the van clapping their hands over their ears but despite the pain Stiles turned on his com so it was two ways now, and the Avengers would hear him. Even as he started to speak, the van rocked with an explosion, doors flying open, smoke pouring into the space.\u00a0\n\"It's an ambush.\" He shouted, coughing on the smoke, trying to grasp his spark to push the smoke out, but the coughing had only forced him to inhale more smoke, and it was working quickly.\n\"Stiles? What's going on?\" That was Clint's voice, and he could hear the anger.\n\"They knew we were coming.\" He managed to gasp out, still coughing, and he fell to his knees. \"They hit the van.\" He managed, even as he watched men swarm into the confined space.\u00a0\n\"We're on our way.\" Was the Captain's quick response. \"Iron man, what's your ETA?\"\n\"I'm heading back to base - but it's going to take me a good 5 minutes.\"\n\"Don't have 5 minutes-\" Stiles managed, and thats when a shape reached towards him. He heard his own strangled cry as he was hit with a taser as if from a distance, heard Clint's voice shout in his ear, and then everything went dark.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nWhen they reached the van, Clint was ready to draw blood. The last thing they'd heard through the coms from the van was Stiles' sound of pain, and the fact that they were drawn out - drawn far enough so that their base could be hit - made him angry. It means whoever was behind this knew them well enough to plan around their habits - knew S.H.I.E.L.D. well enough to know how they'd set up - what their protocols were. He swung into the van, bow leading, but he knew there was nobody there anymore.\n\"They're gone.\" The words were terse, because if he raised his voice, he might actually yell at his friends, and that wouldn't get them anywhere.\u00a0\n\"I've already started tracking the signals in their coms and also their suits. So far they match up - but I imagine the coms will be ditched soon.\"\u00a0\n\"So where are we going?\" Clint asked, knuckles white on the shaft of his bow, and Steve frowned in his direction.\u00a0\n\"We need to figure out why they were taken rather than just killed.\" He said slowly, but to Clint it sounded like an argument.\u00a0\n\"We have to go after them. They have Stiles.\" And Natasha's hand closed over his arm, a comfort and a restraint.\u00a0\n\"We're going to get them back. Get him back. But Steve's right. We can't go in blind. It could be what they want. Why they took them.\"\n\"Doesn't it worry you that they know we'd go in blind?\" Tony asked, and Clint's expression darkened.\u00a0\n\"Not if it's the mole.\" And that had everyone's gaze turning to Clint.\n\"What mole?\" Steve asked sharply, and Clint scowled.\u00a0\n\"I thought you knew. There's been a mole for a while now. That's why things have been routing through different people. Why Stiles has worked so closely with Coulson. I thought you knew.\" But by the way Steve's jaw was tensed, he realized that wasn't the case. \"Stiles has been flagging files that have been tampered with. Flagging information. He and Coulson have it narrowed down to an AIM operative because that's where the majority of the alterations were made. But it's somebody from inside that room.\" He huffed out another breath. \"I thought you knew.\" He found himself repeating, felt Natasha's hand squeeze in comfort. Steve just took a breath, and Clint could all but see the wheels turning.\u00a0\n\"Alright team. This is the plan. Stark. Continue tracking their location. Let us know when they discover the coms. They're likely to, so if they don't discard them, then we know they're expecting us. We're going to go in hot. Romanov, Barton. You'll find a back entrance, detain if possible.\" The unspoken, kill if necessary, was left unsaid. \"Stark and I will take the front. Stark, contact Coulson. Let him know we've been compromised and may need backup. Get ahold of Wilson. See if he'd be able to fly here in time.\"\u00a0\n\"Got it Cap.\" And Steve took a deep breath, reaching out briefly to clasp Clint's shoulder.\u00a0\n\"We'll get him back.\" And there'd be hell to pay.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nStiles came to when a palm cracked across his cheek, snapping his head around and snapping him back into consciousness. He blinked hard against the dizziness and then pain - tried to focus past the pounding in his head and the strain in his shoulders from the pull of restraints at his wrists. There was a stitch in his side and he knew it was where the taser had made contact with his skin. His lungs were tight with the remnants of the gas they'd used to knock them out, and he coughed as he tried to catch his breath. Despite how blurry his eyes wanted to be, he forced them to focus, forced himself to look at the one who'd hit him - the people who'd taken their team. But when he was able to focus he saw only men in masks, though he could see the gleam of cruelty in the dark eyes facing him - a sort of glee of having people under this mans control. He wanted to roll his eyes. This was just his luck. Why was he always the one who got the kidnapper with the violent streak? Him, who couldn't keep his mouth shut to save his life. He wondered, as he had many times, if this was because he'd done something terrible in a past life. Then he couldn't help but wonder if this was punishment for what he'd done in this life. He pushed the thought aside, even as he tried to reach for his spark, calling it forward from the darkness of unconsciousness even as he looked around, trying to see the others. When he couldn't, he looked back at his kidnapper, eyes skimming over the others in the room despite the fact that they were currently paying them no attention.\u00a0\n\"Where are the others?\" He asked, forcing himself not to wince at the roughness of his own voice, and the man watching him gained that gleam again, saying nothing even as he pulled back to hit him again. Even as Stiles' braced himself, another one of the men came forward, grabbing the first man's wrist to stop him.\u00a0\n\"Arovich. Enough.\" The first man, Arovich, looked at the second with a coldness to his gaze that told Stiles whoever this was that had stopped him, was not the usual in charge. When he backed off though, the second one came forward, and to Stiles' silent worry, removed his mask. The man in front of him was probably in his 40s, with hair going gray at the temples, eyes an ice blue that reminded him of Chris Argent, the coldness there similar to how the hunters had been when they'd first met.\u00a0\n\"The rest of your team is here. They will be brought in when they regain consciousness.\" He watched Stiles impassively as he spoke, watching for reaction, and so Stiles kept his face neutral.\u00a0\n\"Don't suppose you're willing to tell me why we're here.\" He asked good naturedly, and the man tilted his head in curiosity.\u00a0\n\"You must be well trained, at S.H.I.E.L.D., to be able to hide your fear so easily.\" And Stiles scoffed. Not because it wasn't S.H.I.E.L.D. that had taught him, but because this man thought words like that would scare him.\u00a0\n\"Maybe you just haven't given me a good enough reason to be scared.\" The man's eyebrows raised at that, and Stiles noted, he had the attentions of the others in the room now too. He counted 6 of them. \"Who\u2019s to say this isn't a training exercise? After all, who would be stupid enough to kidnap the info team on scene with the Avengers?\" And he made sure it was clear in his gaze that he knew very well this wasn't a training exercise. The man's expression widened to a smirk, the coldness replaced by amusement.\u00a0\n\"Arovich. I think our friend here would like a taste of our hospitality.\" The smirk Stiles gave was a challenge, and he clenched his hands into fists, preparing as best he could.\u00a0\n\"You can hit me as much as you want, but that's not why we're here. Until you tell me why that is, we won't get anywhere.\u201d Instead of answering, the man let Arovich hit him, but Stiles didn't stop talking. \"At this rate, we'll be at this all day.\" And he was hit again. He sucked in a breath, coughing again when he caught his breath after the blow to his chest. It stung but he just shook his head. The dizziness was about gone - the tightness in his lungs only from the pain, not the gas. His spark was nearly his again. He wrapped the power around his chains. He was going to break them, and then he was going to use them to break this asshole. The next blow was to his face, closed fist, and he felt the inside of his cheek cut against his teeth, his mouth filling with blood. He spit it to the side before offering a grin, knowing the image he presented would be gruesome. The man in control held up a hand for Arovich to stop and stepped forward again, curiosity cutting through the icy gaze.\u00a0\n\"Maybe you're not scared because you think the Avengers are coming to save you.\"\n\"I don't need to be saved.\" Stiles scoffed, but the man shook his head.\u00a0\n\"I don't think that's true. I think this bravado is because you expect them to swoop in and save you. You think we're keeping you for information. Did you ever consider that we don't want to keep you? Did you consider that perhaps you're only here for us to kill?\" Stiles just rolled his eyes. Death was a threat he'd been facing long before the Avengers came into his life.\u00a0\n\"So that's the plan? To beat us all to death and leave us for them to find? Why - so they know you could get to a handful of their agents?\"\n\"No, because we know it will be equal to ripping out their heart when we they see what we did to their favourite agent.\" So Stiles was the target then, well that was nothing new. His only worry was that if it was him they were after, what were they going to do for the others? Something obviously showed in his expression because the man looked smug. \"Afraid now, are we?\" Stiles shrugged again.\u00a0\n\"Well if it's me you're after, why did you need the others? Why take everyone and not just me?\" That earned more surprise.\u00a0\n\"Shouldn't your concern be for yourself?\" And he let out a huff.\u00a0\n\"You've already told me you want to kill me. What else is there?\" There was annoyance now - the mask cracking. He wasn't reacting how they wanted and so they were going to do something to force his hand. They wanted his fear - anger. It made him wary.\n\"They're awake.\" The voice came from the doorway and Stiles' gaze snapped to the doorway where another masked man was standing, gun in hand.\u00a0\n\"Bring one in.\" The man disappeared only to drag in one of his team members, Stiles was pretty sure his name was Hanson, whose hands were also attached behind his back, and the red of his cheek told Stiles they'd been woken up the same way he was. Hanson's eyes were wild as they darted around the room before landing on Stiles. It made it glaringly obvious he wasn't accustomed to being in the field.\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe you can tell your colleague just what you\u2019ve been telling us. How you don\u2019t need the Avengers to save you, and you don't care that we plan to kill you all.\u201d The fear was clear and nearly visceral enough to taste in the air. The man took out a gun and without any hesitation aimed it at Hanson and fired. Hanson screamed as the shot caught him in the hip and he crumpled, blood flowing quickly from the wound. Stiles\u2019 anger grew tenfold.\u00a0\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do? Torture the others to get to me?\u201d He scoffed, but he knew he wasn\u2019t capable of hiding his rage. The man smirked, obviously pleased to have finally gotten a rise out of Stiles.\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s call it a preview. We don\u2019t need them, and you care about what happens to them.\u201d Hanson was quietly sobbing on the floor, his own blood pooling around him, his breathing harsh with pain. The man just took aim and fired again, hitting him in the opposite shoulder, earning a near animal sound from Hanson\u2019s throat, and Stiles ground his teeth. He was going to tear this man limb from limb.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nThey knew immediately what building their agents were being held in, because the moment they got close, all they could hear was shouting and gunfire. Something had obviously gone wrong before they could even arrive, and that pushed them to move faster, worried now that they would be too late if their own agents were overwhelmed by what looked like a large number of others swarming the building.\u00a0\n\u201cDisable if possible. I have some questions I want answered.\u201d Steve said, before leading the attack on the building, and now with their attention split, the enemy fell under their combined assault.\u00a0\n\u201cNatasha and I are pushing forward.\u201d Clint ground into his com, not even bothering to wait for a response, but none came. Good. It looked like Steve knew better than to try and stop him. He shot someone in the knee, letting Natasha knock him out, not willing to slow down. He could hear fighting further in, just knew it had to be Stiles. When they reached the door, he spared only a glance for Natasha, only waiting for her to nod that she was ready before he shoved the door open, leading with his gun. The first thing he saw was Stiles grappling with the only other man standing, wrapping his arms around his neck. The man shifted and Stiles cried out, obviously hurt, but then his jaw clenched and with a firm tug he wrenched the man\u2019s neck, snapping it. The man dropped, Stiles only just managing to stay on his feet with a stagger. Clint lowered his gun, gaze darting from Stiles to the other bodies on the floor, and then back to Stiles again. Stiles didn\u2019t look at them, he was looking down at his side, and then pulling the small knife from his hip with a sharp hiss, dropping it to the ground.\u00a0\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Natasha called out softly, and Clint hadn\u2019t even noticed that she\u2019d moved past him into the room until she was standing nearly in front of the other man. Stiles just blinked at her, and for one terrifying moment there wasn\u2019t even a sliver of recognition. She moved closer, catching him as he swayed and lowering him to the floor, crouching in front of him, and he blinked, finally recognizing her.\n\u201cNatasha.\u201d She reached out, pushing the hair back from his face.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Can you tell me what happened?\u201d\n\u201cThey wanted to kill me for knowing you.\u201d Then rage flooded his gaze. \u201cThey were going to kill them to scare me.\u201d His gaze flickered to the side then, and Natasha\u2019s gaze followed his.\n\u201cMiles is still alive.\u201d His gaze darkened. \u201cHanson isn\u2019t.\u201d Natasha nodded, looking back at Clint, and that\u2019s all the archer needed to move forward, crouching in front of Stiles. The moment he was there, Natasha moved away, and he heard her voice through the com telling the others that they\u2019d found Stiles and his attackers were down but they were in need of immediate medical attention for one other agent. Clint was looking at Stiles though, who blinked after Natasha before turning back towards him. He stared again for a moment and then relief spilled into his expression.\n\u201cClint.\u201d And he sagged forward, right into Clint. The archer pulled him in easily, curling around him.\n\u201cWe need to get you to medical.\u201d And Stiles\u2019 shoulders started to shake.\u00a0\n\u201cI want to go home.\u201d And Clint knew he didn\u2019t mean New York.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll get you there.\u201d He promised, and he meant it.\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d Stiles murmured then, hands curling around the straps of Clint\u2019s tactical gear, and he squeezed Stiles back in return.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey were met back at base by Coulson and a team of medics, who were quick to take control of agent Miles. They looked towards Stiles as well, but the agent in question waved them off.\n\u201cI\u2019ll come to medical after my debrief.\u201d And after a glance at Coulson, who nodded in agreement, the medical team disappeared. Coulson just stepped in, expression pinched with apology, but anger in his eyes.\n\u201cAgent Stilinski, I regret the situation you were placed in.\u201d And Stiles offered a wry grin, but it was fragile around the edges.\u00a0\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d And then the ice cracked further but a rage leaked in. \u201cWhoever\u2019s it is though, they\u2019re going to regret it.\u201d Clint thought back to the moment they\u2019d found Stiles - covered in blood mostly not his own and snapping a man\u2019s neck without any hesitation. Stiles was right - whoever was responsible was going to regret betraying their trust like this - but whoever it was better hope it wasn\u2019t Stiles who found them first.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles opened the door to his apartment and breathed a sigh of relief. As much as he enjoyed being home, he wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of having everyone hover over him. It hadn\u2019t helped that Derek didn\u2019t want him doing this job anymore - not because he wasn\u2019t good at it, but because it was putting him at too much risk. They\u2019d gotten into a huge fight about it and Stiles had left the Hale house, ignoring Derek\u2019s calls until he\u2019d left back to New York. His phone rang again even as he locked the door behind him and he sighed, checking to make sure it was Derek before tossing the phone onto the couch. He still wasn\u2019t ready to talk to the alpha. He dropped his bag against the wall, wincing as the action pulled at his almost healed bruises. The knock on the door surprised him and he fell into the wall as he spun around, groaning at the impact.\u00a0\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d and maybe it wasn\u2019t his smartest move announcing he was home to a potential threat but at this point he was beyond caring.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s me, heard you were back in town.\u201d at Clint\u2019s voice he stumbled over to the door, yanking it open. He couldn\u2019t help the goofy grin on his face at seeing the archer standing in the doorway wearing worn old jeans and a ratty t-shirt with a purple bullseye on it and a sheepish smile.\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know I was back?\u201d Stiles asked, waving him in, \u201cI just got here.\u201d\n\u201cStark was keeping an eye.\u201d Clint said with an awkward shrug, and Stiles could only shake his head. It made perfect sense.\u00a0\n\u201cWant a drink?\u201d Stiles offered, because now he was realizing that this was the first time he\u2019d seen Clint since they\u2019d dragged him out of the warehouse covered in blood and it was making him nervous.\n\u201cSure. Thanks.\u201d Clint watched Stiles shuffle into the kitchen, uncomfortable. He\u2019d had Tony keep an eye on Stiles while the other man was back home, making sure he was safe since it was their fault he\u2019d been hurt in the first place, and when Stiles had left Beacon Hills and arrived back in New York, Tony had let him know. Despite the fact that Clint had made sure to keep up a steady stream of texting while Stiles had been home, they\u2019d never mentioned what had happened - instead Stiles had complained about everyones hovering, and Derek\u2019s irritation at his being hurt. Clint had returned the favour with the teams latest antics, but it was all kept purposefully lighthearted. Now that Stiles was back in New York, and soon to be back to work, he felt off balance, and he couldn\u2019t forget what Natasha had said - how they\u2019d both be hurt if he didn\u2019t say anything. Now Stiles had been hurt. He blinked in surprise when Stiles offered him a beer.\u00a0\n\u201cI heard you\u2019re supposed to be back at work Monday.\u201d he lead with, and Stiles nodded, taking a gulp of his drink.\u00a0\n\u201cNeed to get a full medical done before agent Coulson will let me back in, but I suppose that\u2019s fair.\u201d and that wasn\u2019t what Clint had expected to hear. When he\u2019d made sure Stiles was headed safely to Beacon Hills the other man hadn\u2019t seemed injured.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d and Stiles actually ducked his head.\n\u201cI might have been in worse shape than everyone thought.\u201d Stiles admitted, and Clint cast him a wary look.\u00a0\n\u201cHow much worse?\u201d Stiles shrugged a shoulder, met Clint\u2019s gaze before his own skittered away. \u201cYeah, Coulson\u2019s always been able to see through that.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like you know that from experience.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s one way to put it.\u201d They lapsed into silence and Clint almost regretted coming - regretting the awkwardness that was settling over them like a heavy blanket.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck it.\u201d Clint blinked in surprise at Stiles\u2019 cursing but before he could react further Stiles crowded into his space, pressing their lips together in a chaste kiss. Clint hadn\u2019t registered moving but when he got back on track he had his arms wrapped tightly around Stiles\u2019 waist, his free hand splayed on Stiles\u2019 back, thumb brushing against bare skin. The kiss was now anything but chaste and Stiles\u2019 arms wound around him in return, fully on board with the direction Clint had taken things. Grasping for Clint\u2019s shoulder, he forgot about the bottle in his hand, tipping the contents between them, and they both jolted at the cold splash as Stiles righted the bottle with a gasp. For a moment they just stared at each other, soaked through with beer, and then Clint grinned, which prompted Stiles into laughter.\u00a0\n\u201cThink this counts for having that talk Natasha wanted us to have?\u201d and Clint didn\u2019t fight the bubble of laughter that broke free, loosening his grip on the younger man and taking his beer bottle from him, setting both down on the kitchen counter.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good start.\u201d and he drew Stiles back in for another kiss. Stiles went with the motion for a moment before pulling back with a grimace.\u00a0\n\u201cCome on, you can use my shower.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou going to use it with me?\u201d Clint asked before he could stop himself, and watched Stiles freeze in surprise. He almost kicked himself but then Stiles turned back, and his grin was wicked.\u00a0\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t want you getting lost.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nLeaning back against the headboard, Clint traced the faded yellow bruises on Stiles\u2019 naked back, fingertips gentle, eyes tracking the healing edges his fingers had already traced. Stiles\u2019 hummed at the feeling, opening his eyes from where he\u2019d smushed his face into the pillow, sheets rumpled around his waist. There was a smile on his face but his eyes were guarded. Clint could understand why - after all, they\u2019d gone from ignoring that there might be something between them to sleeping together, but Clint wasn\u2019t about to give that up.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you staying?\u201d Stiles asked softly, and Clint settled his hand more securely on Stiles\u2019 back.\u00a0\n\u201cWas hoping to.\u201d and Clint was glad to see the guarded look fade behind relief. Stiles reached out an arm then, sliding it around Clint\u2019s waist, thumb sweeping gently against his hip bone. Clint was quick to use that leverage to flip them over so Stiles was on his back and rolled over to kiss him again, revelling in the fact that he could. Stiles grinned into the kiss, hands sliding under the sheet to find more bare skin.\u00a0\n\u201cI could get used to this.\u201d and Clint shifted to kiss his way down Stiles\u2019 chest.\u00a0\n\u201cGood.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nStiles was more than glad to be back at work. Not that he\u2019d missed the stress of it, but he definitely had missed having things to do. He couldn\u2019t help the silly grin that spread across his face, heat rushing to his cheeks. Not that Clint had given him much time to be bored - but still. It was nice to have a purpose again. His phone buzzed in his pocket and he fished it out, wondering if it was Clint bugging him about the fact that they\u2019d eaten all the leftovers, but when he saw the name on the screen his mood plummeted. Not one to ignore his problems, especially when it came to pack, he slid his thumb across the screen, pulling up the text from Derek.\u00a0\n\nDerek Hale:\n\n\n I\u2019m sorry.\n\nThe guilt was immediate. Look at Derek being the bigger person once again, reaching out when really it was both of them who\u2019d been in the wrong. Well, Stiles mused, he hadn\u2019t been completely wrong, but he hadn\u2019t needed to get as angry as he had when Derek was just trying to make sure he was safe. Stiles pushed away from his desk, glancing around the room to his colleagues before heading out of the room, slipping into an empty hallway to dial Derek\u2019s number.\u00a0\n\u201cStiles?\u201d\n\u201cDerek, hi.\u201d and now that he had him on the phone he didn\u2019t know what to say. Luckily, Derek didn\u2019t have the same problem.\u00a0\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry I tried to force the issue on quitting your job. I get that it\u2019s important to you, and I respect that. That\u2019s part of what makes you who you are, that you see things through no matter what life throws at you. You have to understand that it\u2019s dangerous for you though, and being friends with these people puts you in danger.\u201d Stiles felt himself bristle but before he could snap out a retort, Derek was pushing on. \u201cBut who are we to judge? My family\u2019s been putting you in danger for years.\u201d and that had Stiles softening all over again.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry too.\u201d he blurted out, before he could think twice. \u201cIt was pretty unreasonable to ask me to quit but I get why you\u2019re worried. I would be worried too if it was you who\u2019d gotten hurt.\u201d he hesitated, wondering if he should tell him about Clint, but he wasn\u2019t ready to share that yet, and he just knew Derek wasn\u2019t going to be pleased that he\u2019d formed one more connection outside of the pack. \u201cI really care about these people though.\u201d he admitted instead, and Derek sighed through the phone. It sounded resigned and it had Stiles\u2019 guilt worsening.\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d Stiles didn\u2019t quite know what to do with that tone of voice.\u00a0\n\u201cLook, how about I make sure to come home more often. I know it\u2019s sort of fallen aside cause I\u2019ve been so busy with work but that isn\u2019t fair to you guys. Let\u2019s say at least one weekend a month, minimum.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be great, Stiles. And maybe we can come visit you in New York?\u201d Even as Derek proposed the idea, Stiles\u2019 looked up to see Clint walking down the hall towards him in full Avengers gear, and his thoughts were derailed.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, let\u2019s do it. But Derek? I gotta go, I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d and he hung up before the alpha could answer, turning fully to face Clint as he came to stand in front of him.\u00a0\n\u201cDid I interrupt something?\u201d and Stiles shook his head.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with all this?\u201d he asked, giving a wave to the uniform.\u00a0\n\u201cNat and I have a mission. I\u2019m going to be gone for a couple of days.\u201d and Stiles felt his heart sink before immediately shaking it off. This was normal. Clint went on missions all the time that weren\u2019t Avengers related - this was just the first time since they\u2019d started - whatever they\u2019d started. Clint\u2019s eyes were sharp on his face though and he reached out carefully, touching his arm just above the elbow.\u00a0\n\u201cWe still okay?\u201d and it made Stiles realize Clint was just as nervous as he was. He didn\u2019t bother hiding his wry grin.\u00a0\n\u201cGuess this is the life of dating an international spy, huh.\u201d he said instead, and Clint\u2019s smile was slow but beautiful.\u00a0\n\u201cGuess so.\u201d he leaned in then, catching Stiles in a brief but hungry kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll see you when I get back.\u201d and Stiles nodded, feeling a little dazed but mostly pleased.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be here.\u201d and with one last kiss, Clint was off. A throat cleared to his left and Stiles spun to see agent Coulson watching him with what could only be considered amusement.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I need to cite you on appropriate workplace behaviour, do I?\u201d And Stiles flushed bright red.\n\u201cNo, sir. I\u2019ll just,\u201d and he made an abortive move behind him before turning and hurrying back to his desk. He had a lot of work to catch up on. The reality of that thought sank in. He also had a mole to catch. With that in mind, he settled in to work.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\n\u201cAgent Stilinski.\u201d Stiles looked up in a daze, feeling completely out of sorts. He rubbed at his eyes, blinking to try and clear his vision before he looked up to see Agent Coulson standing next to his desk.\n\u201cSir?\u201d he questioned, confused, and his senior officer frowned.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you have any idea what time it is, agent Stilinski?\u201d and Stiles looked around then, noticing now that all the other desks were empty. He vaguely recalled one or two people leaving, but he\u2019d been so focused on his work that he hadn\u2019t really been paying attention. He glanced at the clock now in the corner of his screen and realize it was nearing midnight and for a moment he could only stare at the clock in disbelief.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you still doing here, sir?\u201d he found himself blurting out instead, and Coulson honest to God rolled his eyes at him.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s your first week back at work after a difficult experience, agent Stilinski.\u201d was the reply, and Stiles just blinked again, running a hand through his hair as he looked over the notes scattered across his desk.\u00a0\n\u201cI was narrowing in on the mole.\u201d Stiles admitted then, squinting at where his handwriting had become nearly illegible. \u201cLost track of time.\u201d Then he was looking back up at Coulson, frown forming on his face. \u201cDid Clint ask you to keep an eye on me while he was out of town?\u201d he asked before he could think better of it, and this time Coulson offered that tiny little smile that was barely an uptick of his lips, but clearly showed his amusement. Instead of responding, Coulson pulled up a chair.\u00a0\n\u201cIt looks like you\u2019re getting close.\u201d and when Stiles nodded, he settled in. \u201cWalk me through it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019d found the mole. It hadn\u2019t been anybody with a particular grudge or even all that much care for the people involved. He\u2019d just been doing what he was told - just another face in the faceless crowd that was all the organizations SHIELD fought against. That it was AIM this time meant nothing; all that mattered was that someone responsible for hurting him and his teammates was caught - right? Stiles stared blankly at the wall in front of him, wondering if the calm he was feeling was because he was disassociating since he was pretty sure he should be feeling anything but calm. Seeing as the reason he was in this room was because he\u2019d physically gone after his coworker probably meant he wasn\u2019t actually calm, but he couldn\u2019t seem to focus enough to be angry. He wondered if maybe the sedative they\u2019d jabbed him with was still in his system. After all, he\u2019d woken up in this room after he\u2019d gone after the person behind his team mates being killed in front of him. He shifted but his body still felt weird, and he took that as confirmation that the sedative was still doing it\u2019s work. He wondered how much force it would take to break the wall he was staring at. He wondered if they\u2019d been able to sew that asshole back together after Stiles had gutted him with the knife from his boot. He wondered if they\u2019d searched him and found the knife he kept in his other boot. He found he didn\u2019t care enough to check. And yeah, that was definitely the drugs. A door opened to his left but he didn\u2019t turn to look, he was too busy counting the ridges in the concrete.\u00a0\n\u201cWow, they really gave you the good stuff, didn\u2019t they?\u201d and that did have Stiles turning his head because that was Tony\u2019s voice, and there was no way Tony was allowed to be in here, was there?\n\u201cWhadreyoudoinhere\u201d Stiles slurred out, body tilting from the motion of turning his head, and Tony looked surprisingly unamused.\u00a0\n\u201cJailbreak. If birdbrain finds out you got locked up in here he\u2019ll just get himself locked up, and chances are it\u2019ll be harder to get him out of wherever they put him.\u201d Stiles frowned. Didn\u2019t Tony know why he was in here? The billionaire rolled his eyes. \u201cI know exactly why you\u2019re in here.\u201d and oops, was he thinking outloud? \u201cI knew the moment you found the mole.\u201d Stiles blinked in surprise. Tony wasn\u2019t afraid of him after he\u2019d literally torn someone open with a knife? Did he not see the footage? Tony stepped forward, hefting him to his feet, and when Stiles swayed he pulled his arm across his shoulders.\u00a0\n\u201cWe can talk about that later. Realistically though, he\u2019s one unlucky bastard that they managed to save his life because Clint and Natasha are already on their way back into town.\u201d Stiles just slumped into Tony, grateful. \u201cNow try and walk with me. I couldn\u2019t exactly bring my suit in here. We have to move quickly.\u201d Stiles only just managed a hum in response. Tony actually cracked a grin but it was tense around the eyes. \u201cYou know, now that they\u2019ve got you drugged, I should ask you about why you put off such a high energy reading. It caught my attention because you register almost as high as one of my reactors. That\u2019s a lot of energy. A lot more than exists in any normal person. So, care to share?\u201d Stiles just hummed again. He\u2019d had no idea he put off as much energy as a reactor. Did that make him a walking battery? The thought had him giggling. Tony rolled his eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no.\u201d They made it to the front door and Stiles found himself looking up at Steve who offered a tight smile before helping Stiles into the car when Tony moved quickly to the drivers seat. Stiles flopped into Steve, offering a dopey grin, and Steve\u2019s smile only tightened further.\n\u201cWhat did they give him?\u201d\n\u201cJarvis is pulling up the record as we speak.\u201d\u00a0\nStiles wished he could tell them that they\u2019d had to give him three sedatives because that was the only thing that could make him stop going after the mole. The mole who\u2019d gotten Hanson killed. The mole who\u2019d nearly killed Miles. Who\u2019d wanted him dead just to hurt the people he cared about. They were lucky he hadn\u2019t used his Spark. Then three wouldn\u2019t have been enough. Tony let out a strangled sound from the front seat and Stiles gave him a funny look, glancing up at Steve who was watching him with a look he didn\u2019t quite understand. Stiles decided that he was going to close his eyes and rest until they got to where they were going. He deserved rest, right? Yeah, he was pretty sure he did. Right before he closed his eyes he tilted his head up to look at Steve nearly falling into the blonde\u2019s lap.\n\u201cIs Clint back yet?\u201d and that earned him a real smile.\n\u201cSoon.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMkay.\u201d and he closed his eyes, not bothering to push away from Steve\u2019s solid warmth.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClint wondered what it was about Stiles that managed to put him right in harms way all the time. He strode onto base, Natasha at his side, and headed straight for Coulson\u2019s office. He barged in, not even bothering to knock, and was met by Coulson\u2019s grim expression.\u00a0\n\u201cCare to explain what happened, sir?\u201d and he knew his tone was confrontational, but he couldn\u2019t believe that Stiles had been\u00a0 heavily sedated and put in isolation. Coulson put up a hand for patience, coming up and around from his desk.\u00a0\n\u201cWe needed the man alive for questioning and agent Stilinski was going to kill him. He\u2019s not in trouble for being taken offsite to the tower.\u201d Coulson rubbed a tired hand over his face. \u201cI was in the room when he figured it out. There was no way we would\u2019ve been able to stop him otherwise.\u201d and Clint couldn\u2019t really argue with that - not really. Not when sedation meant no bodily harm. He\u2019d seen the look on Stiles\u2019 face when they\u2019d found him in that warehouse - teammates down. To Clint and the others, while it was hard to lose an agent, it was nothing like it had been for Stiles, who\u2019d worked with these people regularly, created relationships with them; and then watched one get killed, the other tortured to near death. He wasn\u2019t surprised that Stiles had then wanted blood - hell, they all did.\u00a0\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the operative now?\u201d Natasha asked, and Coulson met her gaze evenly.\u00a0\n\u201cInterrogation. We had to stitch him up on sight and decided it would be best to keep him here.\u201d and the expression was grim. Natasha nodded.\u00a0\n\u201cPermission to speak to the prisoner, sir?\u201d and if they didn\u2019t know him so well, both Clint and Natasha would\u2019ve missed the slight tilt of his lips.\n\u201cPermission granted.\u201d then he reached back to his desk, picking a phone up off the surface and offering it to Clint. \u201cThis belongs to Stiles. It shut off as soon as it was taken off him and nothing we\u2019ve done has been able to turn it back on.\u201d and that was clearly suspicious but Clint accepted the phone, pocketing it. He didn\u2019t miss how it vibrated the moment it was safely tucked away. Clint just kept his face blank. He\u2019d check it when he was out of there. Then Coulson just heaved a sigh. \u201cTell him he did a good job.\u201d and that had Clint finally relaxing.\u00a0\n\u201cWill do, boss.\u201d and the mocking salute was as much an apology as it was forgiveness for the slight against Stiles\u2019 person.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, and Barton?\u201d Clint turned to look back even as he stepped out the door. \u201cLet him know that catching the mole doesn\u2019t excuse him from the other six case files he\u2019s been ignoring.\u201d and Clint grinned, hurrying out the door. Now that he\u2019d cleared things up with Coulson, he wanted to get back to the tower - check up on Stiles as soon as possible. As if sensing the directions his thoughts had taken, the phone in his pocket buzzed again. Curious, because he had no doubt that Coulson had been telling him the truth, he pulled the phone out only to see it working perfectly fine. What was more concerning was the list of notifications - missed calls and messages, and a few texts visible even on the lock screen. It was the most recent text that caught Clint\u2019s attention though.\u00a0\n\nDerek Hale:\n\n\nWe\u2019re on our way to New York.\n\nAnd that was time stamped almost a full 8 hours ago. He quickened his pace, tucking the phone back away. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder now why Stiles\u2019 phone worked just fine for him when it turned off when anyone else touched it, and then couldn\u2019t help but wonder how on earth Derek Hale had known that something was wrong - and not just him. There were texts and calls from Isaac, Scott, and Lydia too. How had they known Stiles was in trouble? Enough that they were willing to travel to New York from California just to check up on him? He checked the time stamp and cursed. If they were anything like Stiles, they would\u2019ve been on the first flight out of there, and if he didn\u2019t hurry, they\u2019d be in New York before he could even tell Stiles they were coming.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nStiles woke up with a jolt, whole body thrumming with energy, and none of it particularly positive. Anxiety was settling over him like buzzing electricity, lighting up his nerves and catching the breath in his chest. He looked around wildly, for any sign of what could explain just what was so wrong - and found himself surrounded by vaguely familiar walls. He forced himself to focus, pushing to a sitting position from where he\u2019d been laying, and that\u2019s when he realized what was going on. He was at the Avengers Tower. The events from SHIELD headquarters came rushing back and his jaw clenched so tightly it hurt. He\u2019d nearly managed to kill the traitor, but he\u2019d been stopped. Tony and Steve had rescued him. He frowned, trying to remember just what was said, cause something seemed important, but for the life of him he couldn\u2019t recall.\u00a0\n\u201cGlad to see you\u2019re finally awake.\u201d Tony greeted cheerfully, strolling into the room with a tablet in hand. Stiles could only stare at him.\u00a0\n\u201cHow long was I out?\u201d and he looked around, wincing at the pounding headache. The action had Tony pulling a bottle out of his pocket and tossing it at Stiles who caught it easily, quickly shaking out two pain killers into his palm and swallowing them.\u00a0\n\u201cCouple of hours. They really got you good. Though I\u2019ve gotta admit, I\u2019ve been wondering just what you meant when you said the three heavy power tranqs they hit you with wouldn\u2019t have worked if you\u2019d been using your \u2018Spark\u2019.\u201d and he used air quotations. \u201cWhat is a Spark, exactly, and why don\u2019t we know about it?\u201d He could only stare at Tony, because, what? How did he even know what the hell Stiles was? How did he know he could\u2019ve pushed off the effects of the sedative? He knew he\u2019d been thinking about it - Stiles slapped a hand over his face and groaned.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did I say exactly?\u201d\n\u201cNothing too incriminating. Just that you\u2019ve got a Spark, whatever that is, and you asked why we were helping you a lot, which frankly, rude. But I think it was more because you kept asking if we\u2019d seen the footage, and the answer is, yes. We watched you take a knife to that bastard and slice him open.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that didn\u2019t freak you out?\u201d\n\u201cI was more impressed, if we\u2019re being honest with each other, and really I\u2019m hoping you will be \u2018cause I would hate to have to go searching and let others in on the secret.\u201d Stiles grimaced.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d he tried to argue, frowning, unsure how to explain, because telling anyone outside the pack had never really been an option, but he\u2019d also never imagined having friends outside of the pack either. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust you guys - it\u2019s more of a - a safety thing. For me. It\u2019s not - I\u2019m not safe if people know.\u201d and that was his heart trying to beat it\u2019s way out of his chest at the fact that he was somehow actually talking about this. He sucked in a breath and then Tony was right there, hands hovering but not quite touching, tablet out of sight.\u00a0\n\u201cTake a breath with me, okay? Eyes on me.\u201d and he tapped two fingers to the arc reactor, but his gaze never left Stiles\u2019. That point of focus was all Stiles needed to get himself back under control.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d he muttered, rubbing his hands over his face, fingers tugging gently at his hair, and Tony made an inelegant sound.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. Me too. I\u2019m right as rain. Nothing bad ever happens.\u201d Stiles rolled his eyes, but didn\u2019t argue.\n\u201cShould probably tell you that you admitted it in front of Steve too. So really, I\u2019m not the only one who knows.\u201d and Tony actually looks almost apologetic, if only because of Stiles\u2019 recent near panicked state. Stiles huffed out a few choice curses. He reached for his phone, intending on texting Derek, asking for advice on the mess he\u2019d managed to get himself into, and froze when he realized he didn\u2019t have his phone.\u00a0\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my phone?\u201d he near demanded, and Tony narrowed his eyes at him.\u00a0\n\u201cClint has it. He\u2019s bringing it back with him. Why?\u201d then his eyes narrowed further. \u201cWhat do you know about the fact that it wouldn\u2019t open for anyone but Clint? Not that I\u2019m supposed to know that yet, but what can I say, I got bored and tried to hack your phone.\u201d\n\u201cTried?\u201d because while Stiles\u2019 had definitely infused his phone with a little bit of his Spark to hide things from SHIELD incase they ever tried to pry too far, he hadn\u2019t realized that he\u2019d actually managed to block the phones content from everyone. He wondered if it was an intent thing, because the pack used his phone all the time when he was home and he\u2019d been doing this particular piece of mojo since just out of high school. Maybe it shut down at the purposefully hostile touch of an outside system? But that begged the question - why did it work for Clint and not the rest? Not Coulson? The thought that it was because while he trusted them all he viewed Clint as family was probably what made the difference and he nearly flushed at the realization. Tony huffed out a breath.\u00a0\n\u201cYou should probably know that your pals from back home have been trying to get ahold of you. Apparently they\u2019re headed to New York since you didn\u2019t pick up your phone.\u201d Stiles cursed, pushing to his feet despite how he swayed.\u00a0\n\u201cJarvis?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Mr. Stilinski?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cCall Derek Hale please.\u201d and listed off the number. There was a brief ringing and then Derek was answering, growl in his voice.\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s me. Forgot my phone at work.\u201d Stiles said easily, closing his eyes in relief at having caught Derek and not his voicemail.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me Stiles?\u201d and rather than the relief he\u2019d expected, Derek was still angry - no, furious.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re on speaker, Derek. I\u2019m at Stark\u2019s tower.\u201d the stony silence that followed all but crackled with Derek\u2019s rage.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re at your apartment, Stiles.\u201d and without even meaning to Stiles winced. He was supposed to want to see his pack, wasn\u2019t he? But it felt like there were so many secrets between them now, and not even on purpose but because of his work and the secrecy behind the supernatural. It was one secret on top of the other on both sides and it had built to the point where he realized he hid almost everything from everyone. He wasn\u2019t looking forward to having to deal with that - especially since he didn\u2019t really thing he was wrong to keep all these secrets. After all, outing the supernatural to SHIELD was a bad idea on a good day, and on the flip side most of SHIELD\u2019s secrets would actively put the pack in danger if they had the information.\u00a0\nStiles wondered what it was that the pack had felt when he\u2019d gone under - or if they\u2019d felt the change before that - if they\u2019d felt his absolute fury race down the pack bonds, felt his vicious glee when the blood has spurt forwards - felt his indignation at being sedated - then his surrender since anything else would out him as something a bit more than human. He wondered if the surrender to unconsciousness had felt to them like death.\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, that could be considered breaking and entering.\u201d Tony chimed in, and Stiles blinked his eyes open to look at the billionaire who was watching him in return with an inscrutable expression. Though Stiles appreciated the fact that the genius was trying to protect him, he answered before Derek could, knowing it was for the best for everyone.\u00a0\n\u201cHe has a key. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m going back to the apartment. Tell-\u201d and he broke off with another wince. Now wasn\u2019t the time to bring up Clint. \u201cI\u2019ll pick up my phone later.\u201d and Derek hung up. Tony just watched him and Stiles took that as permission, heading for the door and stabbing at the elevator button, no longer able to meet Tony\u2019s gaze. Tony waited until Stiles was out of sight to turn his attention back to Jarvis.\u00a0\n\u201cJ, give me everything we have on Derek Hale and company.\u201d and there was no missing the dark tone. He knew what that sort of temper usually meant - knew the violence that tended to go along with it. From everything he\u2019d learned about Stiles since they\u2019d met all those weeks ago he was fairly certain the younger man wouldn\u2019t ever allow someone to hurt him like that - but that did nothing to soothe Tony\u2019s worry. He also knew that Stiles had known Derek since he was a teen and he knew the kind of power that sort of longterm relationship could have on someone. Then he winced. He wondered if Clint realized just how it was Derek spoke to Stiles. Then he wondered if he\u2019d end up bailing the famous Hawkeye out of jail.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nStiles stood outside of his apartment building and let out a breath. He knew Derek was here and probably at least one other person - but knowing there\u2019d be someone else there did nothing to soothe his nerves. He hadn\u2019t intended to get hurt - hadn\u2019t intended to worry anyone - but here he\u2019d ended up again. He knew Derek was going to bring up the whole \u2018working at SHIELD is too much of a hazard\u2019 thing, and how was he supposed to tell the alpha that he\u2019d actually started dating someone and just hadn\u2019t known how to mention it and now it was too late and would seem like he was hiding it. He felt him before he saw him and couldn\u2019t help the grin that spread across his face as Isaac launched out of nowhere to grab him in a hug, nuzzling into him, lips all but pressed to his ear.\u00a0\n\u201cI missed you.\u201d Stiles hugged him back just as tightly.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles sighed out, \u201cMe too.\u201d and realized it was true, he\u2019d missed him so much it hurt and he hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d been in pain because he was so used to feeling it. When he finally pulled back it was with a soft smile. \u201cSo you and Derek came?\u201d and Isaac gave him a funny look.\u00a0\n\u201cStiles - we\u2019re all here.\u201d and that had Stiles blinking. Everyone?\u00a0\n\u201cBut - why?\u201d and Isaac frowned, taking his hand to pull him inside.\u00a0\n\u201cWe were worried about you.\u201d and his frown deepened. \u201cWe felt how angry you were - and then felt you give up.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s not quite how that happened.\u201d Stiles argued, but it was weak. Then they were at his front door and he was being guided inside. He wasn\u2019t at all surprised to see the whole pack sitting there, but he was surprised to see just how deep their worry went. Lydia was the first to meet them inside the door, cupping a hand to his cheek even as she checked him over.\u00a0\n\u201cYou slipped away.\u201d and Stiles sighed this time.\u00a0\n\u201cTriple sedative. It wasn\u2019t on purpose. I was fine, just - knocked out. With no intent from anyone for that to go any further.\u201d he shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m still fine. You didn\u2019t all need to come out here.\u201d That\u2019s when Derek stepped in.\n\u201cWhy, so you could continue hiding things from us?\u201d Stiles stiffened, and even Lydia pursed her lips from where she stood still facing him, her back to Derek. Her hand slipped from his face just to take his hand, turning to face Derek with him.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m hiding from you?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHow about who\u2019s been all but living with you.\u201d Derek snarled, and Stiles blinked in surprise. His apartment was a fairly scent free zone - his Spark aired it out more or less on the regular so that if any of the wolves did ever come and visit they wouldn\u2019t be overwhelmed by the scents here.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to lie to me.\u201d and Stiles scowled, because he wasn\u2019t, he just wasn\u2019t really sure why this was the subject Derek was deciding to be angry about.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d have to actually know what the hell you\u2019re talking about to lie, Derek.\u201d Stiles snapped, and a low growl sounded in Derek\u2019s chest in response. Stiles could see the others behind Derek now, Scott\u2019s face scrunched in confusion and the concern on Erica and Boyd - and not for Derek. Allison\u2019s hand was hovering over her holster because she always carried these days and even she was watching Derek with a frown.\u00a0\n\u201cThe man. Who\u2019s been living here with you. His clothes are all over the place - his scent is everywhere.\u201d and Stiles knew that couldn\u2019t be true - could it? It wasn\u2019t that he got rid of all smells, but really only he was here all the time, and - his thought ground to a halt. Clint had been spending a lot of time here. He had been spending more nights here than at the tower. Until his mission that had only started a few days before, they really had been all but living together. Stiles\u2019 shoulders slumped.\n\u201cShit. As much as you don\u2019t deserve to hear this - you\u2019re actually right. There has been someone. I didn\u2019t really think about it cause, well, it\u2019s pretty new, and he\u2019s been away anyways - and it\u2019s not really official. But - there has been someone.\u201d He wasn\u2019t ashamed of that.\u00a0\n\u201cYou almost never come home anymore, we only saw you last time because you were hurt.\u201d and Derek wasn\u2019t wrong, but Stiles couldn\u2019t really argue that because it was true, but hadn\u2019t they already talked about this? \u201cYou don\u2019t even really talk to any of us anymore - when I called you to apologize you barely talked to me for a minute before you hung up.\u201d\n\u201cI was at work,\u201d Stiles tried to argue, but Derek cut him off by raising his stupidly expressive eyebrows.\u00a0\n\u201cThat was almost a week and a half ago.\u201d Stiles opened his mouth and then snapped it closed. Was it actually that long ago? He huffed out a breath. Probably. That\u2019s about how long Clint\u2019s mission was supposed to take and he\u2019d all but drowned himself in work in the meantime. He took a deep breath and when he let it out tried to let out his mounting frustration.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay. Fair enough. That\u2019s on me.\u201d Rather than accept that though, Derek pushed on.\u00a0\n\u201cYou have someone sharing your bed that you didn\u2019t even think to tell us about.\u201d and Stiles heard what was\u2019t being said - that he hadn\u2019t thought to tell Derek about. His temper flared.\u00a0\n\u201cSo? I don\u2019t know what the hell your problem is right now - I\u2019ve pretty much agreed with everything you\u2019ve said so far and I get that those things are mostly my fault - but I\u2019m also positive that my sex life is none of your business.\u201d The whole room tensed at the words but Stiles refused to back down. He could admit that he\u2019d made some mistakes, but Clint sure as hell wasn\u2019t one of them.\u00a0\n\u201cDid you ever consider that it was because of whoever this is that you caught someone\u2019s attention? That you got hurt?\u201d Stiles wanted to grind his teeth.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you can\u2019t exactly talk if we want to compare who puts who in more danger.\u201d Stiles shot back. \u201cI may get in trouble sometimes but I\u2019ve always gotten myself out of it, with or without anyones help.\u201d he glanced around at the others, but it was clear by their hesitant expressions that this wasn\u2019t what they had expected either. \u201cBut Clint\u2019s always helped me. Even if it was just a hunch he always believed me and he always helped me - even when it meant him getting hurt.\u201d and he didn\u2019t miss Derek\u2019s surprise or the scowl he used to try and hide it. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. That Wendigo? He helped me with that. Didn\u2019t ask questions, just followed my lead because he trusted me. When I got grabbed, he came after me. He\u2019s the reason I got home as quick as I did because I said that\u2019s what I needed and he made it happen, fuck protocol.\u201d He didn\u2019t even know how to express how infuriating he found this whole situation. \u201cThe moment I was back in town he came and checked on me. The moment. So yeah, he has been staying here, and no, I hadn\u2019t told you about him, but you know what? Fuck that, and fuck you. I\u2019m allowed to have people outside of the pack.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou want to choose him over us? Over your pack?\u201d Stiles could only stare, not even sure he\u2019d heard right, but the way everyone else had gone completely tense confirmed it. Scott stepped forward then, trying to step between Derek and Stiles\u2019 but Derek remained immovable which kept Scott trapped behind him.\u00a0\n\u201cDerek,\u201d but Derek\u2019s eyes flared red and he shot Scott a glare to silence him over his shoulder. It only had Stiles\u2019 temper flaring again. What were they, back in high school?\u00a0\n\u201cWhy is this suddenly a competition? I thought you were all here because you were worried about me. Because you cared about me and thought I was hurt.\u201d Stiles demanded, and Lydia spoke up then.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re here.\u201d and her tone was sharp, and all directed at Derek. Derek, in turn, shot Lydia a glare and now it was Derek who stepped closer.\u00a0\n\u201cMake your choice, Stiles.\u201d and that was a threat. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Allison now had a gun in hand and Lydia had actually shifted forward, and he could all but feel her voice vibrating in her throat.\u00a0\n\u201cSo I'm not allowed to associate with anyone outside the pack, is that what you're trying to tell me? I'm not your property. I'm not even one of your betas. I am a Spark, and I am your equal. You can't make that decision for me so back the hell off.\u201d he punctuated the word with a shove to Derek's chest and for the first time in years Derek grabbed Stiles by the front of his shirt and slammed him into the wall hard enough to bruise. Stiles felt the corner of a picture frame draw blood along his shoulder blade, skin having split with the impact. Derek was being yanked away the moment the scent of blood hit the air, Lydia putting herself between them as Scott, Erica, and Boyd held Derek back, the others hovering, waiting. Allison had her gun pointed down, but at the ready. Stiles pushed off from where he'd slumped against the wall, shoulder and back burning, and let his eyes go cold as he glared at Derek, then he turned his gaze to Lydia.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell is wrong with him, but I\u2019m not dealing with it. You're welcome to stay here but I'm not staying anywhere near him. When he gets his head out of his ass, give me a call.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLet me come with you.\u201d Isaac all but pleaded softly, and Stiles reached out to clasp a hand to his neck gently.\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t. You need to stay together. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d and he released his hold, ignoring how Isaac all but whimpered.\u00a0\n\u201cStiles-\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done enough.\u201d Lydia\u2019s voice cut in sharply. Then she made sure to catch Stiles\u2019 eye, sympathy clear in her gaze. \u201cBe safe. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d and Stiles only just managed a civil nod before he left, seething. He couldn\u2019t even feel the pain in his shoulder and he wondered if that meant it wasn\u2019t as bad as he\u2019d originally thought. Tears burned in his eyes but he fought viciously against them - he wouldn\u2019t give Derek the satisfaction even if he wasn\u2019t here to see it. Only able to hear the frantic beat of his own heartbeat, Stiles let his feet carry him aimless into the city streets.\u00a0\nIt could have been hours or minutes - Stiles wasn\u2019t sure, and he blinked hazily up at the building in front of him. He didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d been headed anywhere specific until he stared up at the private entrance to the Tower and felt the sting of tears in his eyes again. Of course it was Clint he went to - despite the fact that this was exactly why Derek was being such an asshole.\u00a0\n\u201cStiles?\u201d he turned at the sound of Clint\u2019s voice, silently cursing his lack of willpower when a few tears slipped free. Clint was by his side then, brows knit in concern, reaching out a hand and only hesitating a moment before brushing the tears from Stiles\u2019 cheek.\u00a0\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d and Stiles watched him wince at the question, at how obvious the answer was, and it made him smile.\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay at my apartment.\u201d Stiles admitted, and his voice was hoarse. Shit. He didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d been fighting the tears to quite this point. Clint moved even closer then, hand closing gently around Stiles\u2019 elbow.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d but even with the question he was guiding Stiles inside.\u00a0\n\u201cDerek\u2019s just - he\u2019s such an asshole sometimes. But everyone was there and it was easier for me to go.\u201d Clint\u2019s frown deepened even as he maneuvered Stiles into the elevator, pushing the button for his floor. Stiles leaned back against the elevator wall only to hiss out a breath of pain, jerking away. \u201cShit.\u201d Clint was behind him then and he swore too.\n\u201cThere\u2019s blood - a lot of it. You\u2019ve bled through your shirt. What the hell happened?\u201d the elevator came to a smooth stop and the doors slid open but Clint\u2019s touch was much firmer now as he pulled Stiles in, all but dragging him through the apartment to the bathroom. Stiles craned his neck around to have a look, because while he\u2019d been to the towers a bunch of times at this point it was always the communal areas with Clint staying with him at his own apartment rather than them staying at the tower. Then, touch gentle but unyielding, he pulled Stiles\u2019 shirt over his head. Stiles grimaced at the feeling of the cold air on his stinging skin; the pain was starting to hit him. Stiles found himself manoeuvred into sitting on the edge of the bathtub and Clint pulled out a first aid kit, setting it on the counter. Stiles looked away then, putting his head in his hands, palms pressing against his eyes. He felt Clint come closer, felt the burn as the archer cleaned away the blood, disinfected the cut before taping a big square of gauze over it. As soon as that was done he was back in front of Stiles, pulling his hands from his face, his own hands gently circled around Stiles\u2019 wrists.\u00a0\n\u201cThe skin of your shoulder is split in the shape of a corner. You\u2019re already starting to bruise. The chances of you being able to do that to yourself are pretty slim. What happened?\u201d he didn\u2019t have to add that the reason Stiles had shown up at all was because of Derek, and it didn\u2019t paint the prettiest picture. Stiles met Clint\u2019s gaze, the clear blue staring back at him, and he felt his resolve starting to crumble. He closed his eyes, shoulders slumping, before he lifted his gaze once more to Clint\u2019s.\u00a0\n\u201cDerek slammed me against the wall. There was a picture frame there. It caught my shoulder.\u201d Clint\u2019s expression darkened, something akin to anger flickering across his features.\u00a0\n\u201cDerek did this to you?\u201d and now Stiles was exhausted. It had been a long day and he\u2019d hit the end of his rope.\u00a0\n\u201cCan I stay here?\u201d he found himself asking, because as welcome as Clint had become in his space, he wasn\u2019t necessarily sure if that was because the archer wanted to share space with him, or because he wanted to keep his own private space, well, private. Clint\u2019s hands tightened minutely on his wrists.\n\u201cAs long as you want.\u201d and Stiles managed a small smile. Then he glanced down at himself, half undressed and feeling grimy in his clothes. There were blood specs on the bottom of his pants.\u00a0\n\u201cCan I borrow something to sleep in?\u201d that earned him a smirk and Clint got to his feet, pulling Stiles up with him.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we can come to an agreement.\u201d and Stiles let the laugh flow out of him, following Clint to the bedroom.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClint sat on the edge of the bed, knees curled to his chest, chin resting on his knees as he stared at Stiles fast asleep on the other side of the bed.\u00a0\n\u201cIs he okay?\u201d he didn\u2019t turn at Natasha\u2019s question, but he did lean into her touch when she stood right next to him.\u00a0\n\u201cHis shoulder is gonna hurt like hell. He probably needs stitches but he was too upset to do it tonight. I\u2019ll check when he wakes up.\u201d the fury welled up again and he clenched his hands into fists in an effort to contain himself.\u00a0\n\u201cYou want to go after Hale.\u201d and it wasn\u2019t a question so Clint didn\u2019t bother answering. \u201cDid he tell you what happened?\u201d Clint shook his head.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, but I can guess.\u201d\n\u201cYou think he\u2019s still trying to get Stiles to go back to California?\u201d and there was doubt in her voice. He understood that, after all, there was no way that Stiles, who\u2019d kicked Ward\u2019s ass for trying to intimidate him, all but slaughtered the group that had kidnapped and tortured him, and gutted the\u00a0 mole responsible, would bow to a show of violence like this. Right? But he also knew what Tony had said when him and Nat had gotten back to the tower; how Stiles had called Derek and the other man had sounded aggressive enough to have Tony concerned.\u00a0\n\u201cI dunno, Nat.\u201d he finally admitted. \u201cI hope not, but what the hell can I do? Hale\u2019s threatening him to get him to leave, and I want to threaten Hale so he won\u2019t.\u201d Natasha rolled her eyes, pinching his shoulder and he tossed a tired grin towards her. She was right, he wanted to do a lot more than threaten.\u00a0\n\u201cHe came to you.\u201d she finally said softly, and she brushed the tips of her fingertips across his cheek. \u201cAfter everything, he came to you.\u201d she offered a wry smile, but it was sad around the edges. \u201cI know what you\u2019ve been doing, and I know you think that counts as talking, but it doesn\u2019t. You need to tell him how you feel. He could have gone anywhere, but he came here. He needs you to tell him.\u201d he glanced up at her face and saw a fierceness he hadn\u2019t expected, and knew it was for Stiles who\u2019d proven himself ten times over. Clint just leaned into her, closing her eyes and trusting her to keep watch for the moment of rest. Then he let out a breath.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m going to tell him.\u201d and rather than leave, Natasha settled down to keep vigil with him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles woke up to his shoulder burning and groaned at the feeling. He realized then that there was an arm wrapped around his waist and that it tightened at the sound of his pain. He was laying on his stomach facing a wall with a darkened window and he turned his head to see Clint awake and watching him.\u00a0\n\u201cDid I wake you?\u201d Stiles found himself asking, voice hushed, not wanting to break the quiet. Clint shook his head against the pillow, and Stiles wondered almost suspiciously for a moment if Clint had slept at all.\n\u201cHow\u2019s the shoulder?\u201d Stiles figured his grimace was answer enough. Clint didn\u2019t answer, shifting up to his elbow instead, the arm that had been wrapped around his waist sweeping up his back to hover over his injury.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you going to tell me why this happened now?\u201d he settled his hand onto Stiles\u2019 back, thumb brushing over the bare skin. It sent sparks dancing along Stiles\u2019 spine, but he could tell from Clint\u2019s expression that doing anything about that and ignoring the subject at hand would not be taken very well.\u00a0\n\u201cDerek\u2019s angry.\u201d and it sounded lame even to Stiles\u2019 ears. He hastened to correct himself. \u201cWell, he was worried first. All my friends were. But then he was angry. I hadn\u2019t told him that I\u2019d gotten close with people outside of - well that wasn\u2019t them.\u201d he\u2019d almost slipped up and said pack and then vindictively he almost wanted to say it - to admit the truth about the supernatural - but he bit back the urge. No matter how big of an ass Derek was being, none of them deserved that. \u201cHe thinks that it\u2019s being associated with you that\u2019s put me in trouble, but I\u2019ve always gotten into trouble, you know? I\u2019m a trouble magnet. If something bad can happen, guaranteed I will be in the wrong place at the wrong time. And that\u2019s okay? Cause at least I know how to handle myself, you know? Better me than someone who might get hurt.\u201d and at Clint\u2019s look he rolled his eyes. \u201cFine. Hurt worse. But that\u2019s not really the point. Point is, he\u2019s trying to blame you for me getting into trouble which is literally the stupidest thing and I just don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s being such an overbearing asshole about it.\u201d he didn\u2019t mention the fact that Derek had all but tried to kick him out of the pack - didn\u2019t even know how he could express the soul deep hurt that had caused to someone who wasn\u2019t a werewolf or even werewolf aware.\u00a0\n\u201cHe sounds jealous.\u201d Stiles twisted around so he could sit up, gaping.\n\u201cWhy would he be jealous?\u201d Clint stared at Stiles who looked so honestly confused, so hurt and angry, and he reached out, sliding his hand to the back of Stiles\u2019 neck and pulling him in for a kiss. When they pulled back, he watched the gears click into place in Stiles\u2019 brain, but rather than understanding, Stiles only looked more confused.\u00a0\n\u201cI told him we were having sex. Told them all actually. It didn\u2019t change anything. He didn\u2019t react any differently knowing that then he had when he didn\u2019t know. Plus, Derek isn\u2019t interested in me - we tried to date once, it didn\u2019t go well.\u201d that was news to Clint.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWe know each other too well.\u201d and even Clint could hear how carefully he was picking his words. \u201cAll our bad shit, we both knew all of it, but the problem was, we\u2019d been the victims of each others shit. He\u2019s one of my best friends, but romantically, we cut each other too deep.\u201d that was something Clint could understand, but it made Hale\u2019s behaviour even stranger.\u00a0\n\u201cCome on. We need to check your shoulder.\u201d he didn\u2019t mention that the gauze was dark with the blood that had bled through. Instead, he rolled out of bed and turned back to see Stiles curled up on the bed, knees to his chest, looking small and lost as he gazed towards the window - towards the world beyond it. Clint moved back in, tracing his fingers from Stiles\u2019 temple to his jaw. Then he screwed up his courage.\u00a0\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just casual for me. I want more than that.\u201d he only just bit back the I want everything that almost spilled out, but it seemed Stiles had heard it anyways, because his face lit up with the softest of smiles.\n\u201cMe too.\u201d Clint knew he was giving the dopiest grin back, but he didn\u2019t even care. He just let his relief that this was his and it was real settle for a moment before finally tugging Stiles to his feet.\u00a0\n\u201cCome on. Your shoulder.\u201d and Stiles followed easily, tangling their fingers together as they walked the short distance. \u201cYou definitely need a couple stitches.\u201d Clint admitted when he\u2019d pulled the gauze free so he could see the injury again. He reached forward, touching the skin about an inch from the split, and winced in sympathy when Stiles hissed out a breath. \u201cAnd some antibiotic cream. Even with me cleaning it last night it\u2019s looking a bit rough.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have all that here?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRan out last week. It\u2019s on order, but there\u2019s more on the common floor so it wasn\u2019t exactly rush shipping. We\u2019ve got pretty much everything you could possibly think could be in a kit down there, and some things you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Stiles shifted, nervous, and Clint understood his discomfort - he also wasn\u2019t one to air his private problems in a group forum, but this injury was more important than any embarrassment and whether Stiles knew it or not they all cared enough about him to not purposefully try and embarrass him. \u201cEveryone already knows your here.\u201d was what Clint decided to tell him, and watched as embarrassment flickered across Stiles\u2019 expression much as he\u2019d predicted. \u201cJarvis keeps everyone informed of guests.\u201d\n\u201cMakes sense I guess.\u201d\n\u201cPlus, Bruce stitches steadier lines than me.\u201d Stiles glanced over at him, rueful smile in place, though it was tight around the edges with nerves.\u00a0\n\u201cSomething tells me you may have planned this.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNah, but it crossed my mind.\u201d he pushed off the wall, offering his hand, and when Stiles accepted it he gave a squeeze of comfort. \u201cHey, J? Bruce on the main floor?\u201d\n\u201cYes, agent Barton, and he has been notified of the situation. Proper equipment has been acquired.\u201d Stiles couldn\u2019t help his grimace.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks Jarvis.\u201d he responded drily, following Clint into the elevator and then catching sight of his reflection when the doors slid closed. It was in that moment that he realized he was still shirtless, something he hadn\u2019t noticed around Clint since they\u2019d both spent a lot of time in each others company in various states of\u00a0 undress. It was too late to go back for a shirt though and then there was the fact that he\u2019d just have to take it off again for stitches anyways, but he still felt exposed. It didn\u2019t help that the moment they stepped onto the common floor, Stiles saw they had an audience. The whole team was there, and it was Tony that looked over first, leering.\u00a0\n\u201cDidn\u2019t realize today was a shirtless day.\u201d Stiles twisted to show his shoulder even as everyone else looked up and Tony whistled. \u201cThat looks like it hurts.\u201d and there was no longer any of that playfulness in his eyes. Bruce stood then, showing the tray he\u2019d been preparing on the table. \u00a0\n\u201cI've got everything ready. If you wouldn't mind,\u201d he motioned to a stool settled in front of where he'd been sitting.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Steve asked as soon as he was sitting, Clint balanced on the edge of the table in front of him. Stiles met Clint's gaze and the expression was clear, either he could tell the truth, or Clint would. Stiles frowned, but there was no way to argue.\n\u201cDerek slammed me into a wall.\u201d Bruce's hand paused where it had been cleaning, and though only for a second, it was enough to know that the news shocked him. \u201cThere was a frame there.\u201d there was a moment of silence where Stiles studiously looked at no one, and Bruce just started stitching as soon as he was ready.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d and Steve's voice was gentle as he moved to crouch so he could catch Stiles' eye. Stiles met his gaze warily. \u201cHas this happened before?\u201d Stiles frowned, not sure why he was asking.\u00a0\n\u201cYou mean does Derek throw me into walls often? Not anymore really, but it's always been his unfortunate way of trying to get his point across.\u201d then his frown twisted to shock as he realized why Steve was asking. He hurried to amend his words. \u201cHe didn't try to hurt me on purpose though, I mean it's not a big deal really. It was just an accident.\u201d he finished lamely, because how did he explain werewolf strength? He winced as Bruce tied the knot on the last stitch before carefully spreading the antibiotic cream followed by fresh gauze. Stiles looked at Clint for help but the anger in the archer's eyes told him he'd get none there. \u201cYou make it sound like we were in some sort of abusive relationship.\u201d he said, starting to feel a bit panicked. He stood abruptly so he could pace away from them all, spinning back with his hands gripping his hair tightly.\u00a0\n\u201cWe dated for like a minute. I am not and have never been in an abusive relationship, okay?\u201d unless you counted the Nogitsune, but did that count as a relationship? He nearly shuddered at the thought. Clint had come closer then, palms open in an easy surrender. \u201cThe only person I\u2019m seeing is you.\u201d\n\u201cI know that.\u201d he soothed. \u201cWe aren't accusing you of anything, Stiles.\u201d and Stiles' gaze darted between him and the others, letting him closer but not relaxing.\u00a0\n\u201cYou're accusing Derek of something though.\u201d\n\u201cHe threw you with enough force that you needed stitches,\u201d Clint replied, \u201cAnd you bled through your shirt last night.\u201d\n\u201cI know that,\u201d Stiles admitted weakly, \u201cBut he's never injured me like this before \u2013 it was usually just a show of strength. Honestly, it isn't a big deal. It\u2019s a thing. Plus it\u2019s been ages - I was pretty sure he\u2019d grown out of the whole shoving people into wall thing when he became a real adult.\u201d\n\u201cYou can see how that's a little bit problematic, right?\u201d Tony cut in, frown in place. \u201cYou're basically saying it's okay that he hurt you cause hey, it's been a while.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that's not true. It's not okay. I just don't want you guys thinking that he's a bad guy, cause he's really not. We've been through a lot together. I mean, I got him arrested for murder. I think he was entitled to retaliation after that.\u201d he was looking at Clint then, who was almost within reach, pleading with his gaze. He didn't want them to think about Derek this way \u2013 no matter how much of an asshole Derek might be sometimes that didn't change who they were \u2013 how close they were. Clint seemed to see that because he nodded, and if the anger wasn't gone at least it was pushed back.\n\u201cOkay, you're right. We don't know him.\u201d he murmured, and he reached out them, hands settling on Stiles' arms, sliding forward so they could wrap around the younger man's waist and pull him in. \u201cNobody's gonna push this any farther.\u201d he promised, and Stiles was too busy sagging against him in relief to hear the warning for everyone else. Tony made a sound of discovery behind him and they both turned to look at him, Clint in warning and Stiles wary. Tony just smirked, the expression smug, and flicked the image off his tablet and onto the big TV.\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe explaining this will help.\u201d and on the screen was a freeze still from the where it all began - Peter\u2019s hulking alpha form leaving the video store. Stiles just stared as everyone else looked from the image to him, his face having drained of colour. \u201cJust a second,\u201d Tony murmured then, fingers tapping quickly. \u201cAha! They may have tried to hide it so nobody could find it, but there were actually security cameras across the street.\u201d and the grainy camera video appeared on screen, where the giant hulking shape shrunk into a man. A very naked man. The video quality was poor enough that you couldn\u2019t really tell much other than \u2018man\u2019, but at least they were the wrong height and build to be Stiles, so that alleviated some of the suspicion off him. It was almost comical, how everyone\u2019s gaze swung from the video that was looping to Stiles, and Stiles almost wished that he\u2019d never joined SHIELD, but then he looked at Clint, and he didn\u2019t think he could ever give this up, even knowing where this was going.\u00a0\n\u201cDoes this have anything to do with what you said yesterday?\u201d Steve asked then, frowning. \u201cAbout how you had - well, something?\u201d\n\u201cHe called it a Spark.\u201d Tony cut in then, \u201cAnd even I haven\u2019t been able to find what that means.\u201d but Tony almost looked apologetic that Steve had outed him like this. \u201cBut I gotta say, this looks way more classic than that. I mean, look at those bright red eyes! I\u2019m going to go with werewolf.\u201d and Stiles felt like the floor had dropped out from under him. He tried to take a step but\u00a0swayed and Clint caught him, lowering him to a chair but not retreating. Stiles scrubbed a hand through his hair, eyes going back to the video, of the hulking beast turning into Peter and walking away before skipping back again and starting all over again, showing the transformation over and over; fur melting into skin.\u00a0\n\u201cIs that true, Stiles? Werewolves?\u201d Stiles had two options at this point, and he knew it. He could either tell them the truth or he could fight tooth and nail and deny every word. He looked around at each of these people, who\u2019d chosen him in their own way to be part of what they\u2019d built here, who\u2019d come for him when he\u2019d been in trouble. Then he heaved a sigh.\u00a0\n\u201cI need to make a phone call.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cStiles, are you alright?\u201d Lydia asked softly, and Stiles wished for one almost violent second that he could hug her.\u00a0\n\u201cNot really.\u201d he admitted and could all but see her expression, how it would be pinched, how her eyes would be filled with a righteous anger. \u201cThey found the video of Peter.\u201d and after all these years he didn\u2019t have to be more specific than that for her to understand. For a moment there was silence but then she sighed.\u00a0\n\u201cDid you confirm anything?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I called you.\u201d and now he knew she\u2019d have that small curve of her lips that belied her pleasure despite her worry.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you want to tell them?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d and he didn\u2019t realize how much he meant that until the relief swept through him at admitting it.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to send Isaac to you. He and Scott won\u2019t even talk to Derek since you left.\u201d her voice softened further. \u201cYou\u2019re their alpha too. They wont speak to him until you do.\u201d Stiles shoulders sagged.\u00a0\n\u201cI know, but this ins\u2019t a choice. I\u2019m not just going to up and leave.\u201d there was another pause and Stiles took the moment to just listen to her breathe, pacing his heartbeat to the sound.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to send Isaac.\u201d she repeated then. \u201cAnd Allison. I would come myself, but-\u201d and it was how she broke off that drew Stiles\u2019 attention.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Lyds?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with Derek.\u201d she admitted after a moment, and her voice was tight. \u201cIt\u2019s been this way for a couple weeks, but none of us know why. It\u2019s almost like in the beginning - but there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s happened that we haven\u2019t handled.\u201d and that had Stiles\u2019 shoulders straightening.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean, handled? What\u2019s happened?\u201d\n\u201cNothing out of the ordinary.\u201d she soothed, knowing his tone as much as he knew hers. \u201cThere was a small issue with some redcaps and a witch, but we dealt with them.\u201d and Stiles wasn\u2019t sure what it was the tipped him off but he was gripping the phone tighter.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened with the witch?\u201d Lydia huffed.\u00a0\n\u201cNothing, really. She just tried to play mind games. She\u2019s not going to be a problem anymore, though. Allison and I took care of it.\u201d but Stiles couldn\u2019t let it go, something felt wrong.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean, mind games, Lydia? You know I know\u00a0you and Allison are more than capable, but mind magic is tricky.\u201d it seemed Lydia had reached the same conclusion he had because she let out a small gasp.\u00a0\n\u201cShe could play with the pack bonds - with the wolves. We weren\u2019t affected, but she could make them feel like they were gone.\u201d and Stiles sucked in a breath.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are the chances the spell isn\u2019t broken?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIf that were true, if it was still twisting through Derek, it would explain his behaviour, why he seems almost feral.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhen did this even happen? Why didn\u2019t anyone tell me?\u201d\n\u201cIt was right before you got hurt, Stiles.\u201d she murmured, and he winced. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to worry you with something we thought we\u2019d dealt with when you were home. You were already in a difficult space.\u201d and he couldn\u2019t exactly argue with that, could he? But it explained why Derek had tried to push him quitting his job, why he\u2019d tried to have him come home. He\u2019d been feeling the echoes of their pack bond breaking, and with every time Stiles had fought back it had strained that worry - enhanced that spell with Derek\u2019s own doubts. He took a fortifying breath and let himself start figuring out how to fix this.\n\u201cAlright, first, get him back to Beacon Hills. How did you deal with the witch?\u201d\n\u201cAllison hit her with an arrow through the heart. I felt her die, but before we could get to the body it was pulled into the earth.\u201d If that wasn\u2019t suspicious, Stiles didn\u2019t know what was.\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s go with the assumption she\u2019s not fully dead then, so once you're back in Beacon Hills, get to the Hale house and on the left hand side of the front door there\u2019s a rune.\u201d he described it to her in great detail. \u201cYou\u2019ll need a bit of blood, but just swipe it over the rune, preferably yours. Sorry Lydia.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. So bloody the rune. Then what?\u201d\n\u201cThat should at least expel any magic that doesn\u2019t belong to one of us out of the house. It should help Derek get some of himself back under control.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed slowly, \u201cBut then what?\u201d and he knew he\u2019d avoided her question.\u00a0\n\u201cThen I come back to Beacon Hills and deal with the witch.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen he made his way back to the common room, having hung up with Lydia, he found everyone waiting for him. Self-conscious now, he didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d started hunching his shoulders defensively until he forced himself to stand tall.\u00a0\n\u201cSo. Werewolves.\u201d he started, and didn\u2019t miss the interest on anyone\u2019s face. \u201cThey\u2019re real.\u201d he expected to be bombarded with about a million questions and couldn\u2019t help but relax with the relief that they were just watching him expectantly, not interrupting. \u201cThey live in packs, kind of like real wolves. You don\u2019t have to be a wolf to be part of a pack.\u201d and with that he gestured to himself. \u201cBut I am part of one. Two of my pack members, Isaac and Allison, they\u2019re coming to meet me here. You can get a full demonstration.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re both werewolves?\u201d it was Tony who could\u2019t help but cut in then, and Stiles shook his head, offering a wan smile. \u201cNo, just Isaac. Allison\u2019s a hunter. She\u2019s just coming for moral support and because Lydia doesn\u2019t trust me to be honest about my injuries. Or Isaac really, because Isaac would hide it from her if I asked. Allison wouldn\u2019t dream of lying to Lydia.\u201d then he met Clint\u2019s gaze and his smile was full of nerves. \u201cYou\u2019ll like Allison, her favourite weapon is a bow.\u201d and Clint\u00a0smiled back. Though it wasn\u2019t exactly comforting that Stiles had kept such a big secret from them, he knew just as well that Stiles hadn\u2019t told his, well, pack, anything personal about them either, and if what he was saying was true that would have been even more difficult than hiding their supernatural identities. It wasn\u2019t like they didn\u2019t all know how important Stiles\u2019 friends back home were. So he reached out a hand from where he was lounging on one of the smaller couches and watched Stiles\u2019 whole frame relax as he hurried over, sinking down next to him. Clint threw an arm around him, drawing him in, and Stiles went easily.\u00a0\n\u201cWell I\u2019ve got about a million questions.\u201d Tony cut in then, and Stiles actually grinned now. Clint wondered if all the nerves had been because he thought they\u2019d reject him. He met Natasha\u2019s gaze from where she was sitting next to Bruce and she nodded, understanding his thoughts perfectly. Clint just tightened his grip on Stiles.\u00a0\n\u201cAsk away.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Isaac and Allison arrived at the tower, there was a tension in the air that had nothing to do with just what Isaac was and everything to do with the fact that they were about to meet some of the people who\u2019d formed Stiles into who he was now. Stiles stood the moment the elevator slid open and he was halfway across the room before they\u2019d even realized he\u2019d moved. A tall, curly haired blonde met him in the middle of the room, wrapping around him, and it had most people looking to Clint who\u2019s eyes stayed firmly on Stiles, though his jaw was tight.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m okay, it\u2019s okay.\u201d They heard Stiles say, even as Allison moved forward, her gaze sweeping over everyone else even as she stepped in to check Stiles over for himself, easing Isaac back. They all watched the woman\u2019s dark eyes go stormy as she caught sight of the gauze.\u00a0\n\u201cHow bad is it.\u201d and her tone was clipped. They stared at each other until Isaac bodily maneuvered Stiles around so he could see the injury, and they were all surprised when the man let out an actual growl, blue eyes flaring a bright gold.\u00a0\n\u201cIsaac.\u201d and Stiles\u2019 tone was sharp and immediately had gold fading back to blue. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Then he turned to Allison. \u201cCouple stitches. Nothing major.\u201d Allison just hummed in response but didn\u2019t argue, instead lifting a brow.\n\u201cAre you going to introduce us?\u201d and then out of the messenger bag slung across her torso she pulled out one of his shirts, handing it to him with a near flourish. He shrugged the plaid on with a grateful sigh, smiling warmly at her.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright everyone,\u201d and he turned back to face the room. \u201cThis is Allison and Isaac.\u201d then he looked back at the pair. \u201cGuys, that\u2019s Tony, Steve, Natasha, Bruce, and Clint.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d and the tone was nearly bored but nobody could miss the almost accusing nature in Natasha\u2019s tone despite how she hid it behind an easy smile. Allison responded in kind with a sweet smile that Stiles knew was all venom.\u00a0\n\u201cThen I suppose it\u2019s a good thing our pasts alone don\u2019t define us.\u201d and there was the barb Stiles had expected. He rolled his eyes.\n\u201cAli, come on.\u201d and he was unimpressed. Allison shrugged, unrepentant.\u00a0\n\u201cShe started it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are we, 12? Just because someone starts it doesn\u2019t mean you have to continue it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cUnless you can finish it.\u201d Isaac piped in helpfully, \u201cRight, Stiles?\u201d and he wanted to slap a hand over his face, because yes, he had said that, but now isn\u2019t exactly when he wanted that brought up.\u00a0\n\u201cYes, Isaac. That\u2019s right. Try not to get into fights unless you know you can finish it.\u201d and now Tony snickered.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re like their mother.\u201d and Stiles huffed out a breath. Allison just let out a bright laugh, no longer even remotely hostile.\u00a0\n\u201cI can see why you like them.\u201d Then her gaze swept over them again, settling on Clint. \u201cYou must be his archer.\u201d and Stiles narrowed his eyes at her.\u00a0\n\u201cI never told you that.\u201d and Allison rolled her eyes at him.\n\u201cWell they certainly weren\u2019t my arrows in your apartment.\u201d and it surprised a laugh out of him even as he gave her shoulder a shove.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re a shit starter, you know that?\u201d but she ignored him, turning her gaze back to Clint expectantly. The archer in question just nodded, hands shoved in his pocket where he was leaning against the couch, having stood as soon as Stiles had.\n\u201cThat would be me.\u201d he glanced at Stiles and the smirk on his face told the younger man they were okay. \u201cI told you leaving the arrows in the bed frame would give them the wrong idea.\u201d and Stiles watched Tony sputter even as Steve went pink. Bruce looked awkward but Natasha looked comfortable once again, taking her cue from Clint. Isaac just groaned.\u00a0\n\u201cStiles, this is more than I wanted to know.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well, this is what you get when you pretend to check up on me just to meet who I\u2019m dating.\u201d Isaac pouted.\u00a0\n\u201cI did want to check up on you. You got hurt.\u201d and suddenly the atmosphere grew tense again. Stiles rubbed a hand over the back of his head, turning back to the others.\n\u201cI guess now would be a good time to mention that we\u2019re pretty sure Derek\u2019s been cursed by a witch and that\u2019s why he\u2019s so aggressive?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWerewolves, witches, hunters - this was way more than Clint had expected. Not that he didn\u2019t believe it, after all he\u2019d seen all sorts of enhanced, not to mention aliens, and Isaac had done a helpful demonstration, but it was still a bit disorienting. Maybe it was easier to believe the whole alien thing because while it existed it was still separate - not on the earth he\u2019d grown up on - but now he was learning that there were all sorts of things that went bump in the night that had been hiding in plain sight and that was a little disconcerting. But again, it made sense. He remembered the kid he and Stiles had found, with the white eyes and the needle-like teeth and how Stiles had just known something was going on. Turns out the kid had been a Wendigo and Stiles had known because he\u2019d been dealing with all this supernatural stuff since he\u2019d been a teenager and nobody else had known. He wasn\u2019t really sure how to deal with that. Not that Stiles had been involved, but that nobody had protected him the way he seemed to protect everyone else. He knew Stiles\u2019 dad had been the Sheriff - was still the Sheriff - but from what he\u2019d gathered, the man hadn\u2019t been brought into things until years later.\u00a0\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Clint turned at the sound of Stiles\u2019 voice, at the worry he saw there, how his hands couldn\u2019t seem to decide what to do with themselves. Both Allison and Isaac were speaking with Natasha in low voices across the room and he knew they were discussing the plans to go back to Beacon Hills.\u00a0\n\u201cNot quite what I expected.\u201d He responded wryly and Stiles managed a smile.\u00a0\n\u201cCan\u2019t say it ever is.\u201d Clint couldn\u2019t argue that, but he could definitely help with the anxiety he was watching tighten Stiles\u2019 shoulders. He reached out, wheeling Stiles in and sliding into a kiss.\u00a0\n\u201cDoes that help?\u201d he murmured against Stiles\u2019 lips, and the other man smiled, nodding before kissing him again.\u00a0\n\u201cI need to go back with them.\u201d and Clint actually laughed at him.\n\u201cWhat made you think I was going to let you go alone?\u201d Stiles slumped into him, pressing his face against Clint\u2019s neck but the archer felt his grin.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to feel obligated.\u201d Clint made a rude noise, pinching Stiles\u2019 side who gave a yelp in response but didn\u2019t pull away. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult.\u201d Stiles continued. \u201cI can feel it now - now that I know what I\u2019m feeling for. Derek\u2019s hurting. The witch\u2019s magic, it\u2019s hooked in deep.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know much about magic, but I can tell you he has another thing coming if he thinks he can hurt you like that again.\u201d and when Stiles pulled back just far enough to see his face, he made sure his expression was serious. \u201cI heard you say it wasn\u2019t his fault, that it isn\u2019t who he really is, but I\u2019m going to be honest with you and say I don\u2019t really care because you\u2019re injured.\u201d Stiles huffed, but nodded.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it, but I understand. But hey, it\u2019ll be easier once we deal with the witch, okay? Then you can meet him, and everyone else.\u201d Stiles\u2019 expression grew pinched with worry. \u201cYou do want to meet them, right?\u201d\n\u201cThey get to meet Natasha, so it\u2019s pretty fair.\u201d and there was Stiles\u2019 bright grin again. \u201cNow come on. I want to see Tony\u2019s face when Steve tells him only Nat and I can go with you.\u201d Stiles snickered.\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, we can\u2019t just have all of the Avengers running around Beacon Hills. It would cause a riot.\u201d then the grin went wicked. \u201cHow much do you want to bet Tony will show up anyways?\u201d\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nStiles climbed behind the wheel of his jeep with a sigh of relief. He\u2019d missed his jeep. It had been parked in longterm parking at the airport and now that he was back, even if it was only for a visit, it felt like coming home. Clint slid into the passenger seat, glancing around in approval even as Isaac climbed into the back.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened to Natasha?\u201d Stiles couldn\u2019t help but ask even as he adjusted the mirror. Isaac shrugged.\n\u201cShe said she was driving back with Ali. That\u2019s okay, right?\u201d Stiles and Clint exchanged a look, and while Clint rolled his eyes, Stiles smirked.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s cool. Did she say where they were headed?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but we\u2019re going to your house, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cFigured we should check on Dad, update him on everything first.\u201d and Clint watched, more than a little fascinated with how Isaac seemed to relax as Stiles laid out his plans. He glanced over as Stiles pulled out of the parking lot and made his way from the airport and onto the highway. \u201cGreat. Call Lydia. Let her know we\u2019re here and that we\u2019re going to see Dad. Tell her Allison\u2019s with Natasha. Oh and if she wants to meet us, that\u2019s fine too. Also, I\u2019m going to need them to take me to where they last saw the witch. Once I can get a beat on her, we\u2019re going to pay Derek a visit.\u201d Clint saw Isaac\u2019s eyes flash yellow and watched Stiles\u2019 eyes narrow at him in the mirror. Isaac responded by tilting his head to show his neck, and while Stiles sighed, his eyes were fond. \u201cCall Lydia, Isaac.\u201d then Stiles glanced at Clint, cheeks flushing. \u201cYou\u2019re staring.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou gonna tell me not to?\u201d and there was no denying the smirk on his face. Stiles rolled his eyes but the blush grew darker.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works.\u201d\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Clint agreed, but the laughter in his voice was unmistakeable.\u00a0\n\u201cYou realize you\u2019re about to meet my Dad, right?\u201d and Clint rolled his eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already met everyone important in my life.\u201d and he was realizing that this whole relationship thing was a lot easier than he\u2019d always expected. Stiles reached out across the console, lacing their fingers together and giving a tight squeeze. This time when he spoke, he didn\u2019t look over, pointedly keeping his gaze fixed on the road.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to meet Derek, too.\u201d Clint only just resisted the urge to look back at Isaac, because this wasn\u2019t really a conversation he wanted to have with an audience, but it was also better to get this over with sooner rather than later.\n\u201cI know it seemed like I hated the guy earlier, and I kind of did. I mean, he hurt you, how did you expect me to react? You were bleeding and I wanted to take him out.\u201d he didn\u2019t feel the need to add that Natasha would\u2019ve helped him. \u201cBut you\u2019ve always talked about Derek - about how close you are. And I get it. Nat and I are the same way, and honestly she\u2019s hurt me a hell of a lot worse than that.\u201d that earned a snort from Stiles, but he was relaxed once more and that was satisfying enough. \u201cBut, on that note.\u201d and Stiles glanced over sharply at the tone. \u201cHe hurts you like that again, and I won\u2019t be held responsible for my actions.\u201d and he met Stiles\u2019 gaze evenly when he glanced away from the road again, hesitant and wary. For a moment Clint was afraid Stiles would disagree, but then he nodded.\u00a0\n\u201cSeems fair. But you\u2019ll have to get in line.\u201d and Clint blinked in surprise.\u00a0\n\u201cWho\u2019s first?\u201d he blurted out, and Stiles cackled. Thankfully, Isaac came to his rescue from the backseat.\u00a0\n\u201cLydia. She\u2019ll skin him alive.\u201d and Isaac said it so smugly and matter-of-fact that Clint couldn\u2019t do anything but believe him.\u00a0\n\u201cWell that\u2019s terrifying.\u201d he finally said instead, and Stiles beamed a grin at him.\n\u201cI know. It\u2019s amazing. She\u2019s a goddess.\u201d and when Clint narrowed his eyes, Stiles squeezed his hand before pulling away so he could pull off the highway, guiding the jeep through he streets. \u201cYou\u2019ll understand when you meet her.\u201d he added, and Clint looked back at Isaac for confirmation. The blonde wolf shrugged but agreed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been like this.\u201d he added sagely, and Clint just grimaced, unimpressed. Then Stiles was pulling into a driveway next to a sheriff\u2019s car and Clint\u2019s attention was stolen from the subject at hand.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d but Stiles just sat for a moment, staring up at the house, expression blank before he climbed out of the jeep, keys jingling in his hands as he walked up the steps. He unlocked the door and stepped inside slowly, and it was with a caution Clint hadn\u2019t expected.\u00a0\n\u201cDad? I\u2019m home.\u201d Clint could hear the TV playing in the other room, though he didn\u2019t hear whoever was watching it get up, just saw the man step into the hallway in front of them, grin on his face.\n\u201cStiles!\u201d and he opened his arms for his son who pretty much launched himself forwards with none of the hesitation he\u2019d shown stepping into the house. John Stilinski laughed when he caught his sons weight and the two of them gripped each other in a tight hug. When the finally pulled away, the older man slung his arm around his son\u2019s shoulders before turning his gaze on the other two standing in the hall. \u201cIsaac.\u201d he greeted easily, same easy grin on his face, then his gaze fell on Clint and the archer could tell why this man had been Sheriff for so long because there was a sharpness to his gaze that said he already knew way more than they\u2019d shared. The man stared at him for nearly a full minute before turning his gaze on Stiles, eyebrows raised and unimpressed. Stiles just pouted back.\u00a0\n\u201cAw, Dad, c\u2019mon. I was going to tell you about him. Things have just been crazy, okay? I swear I wasn\u2019t keeping it a secret on purpose. See look! I even brought him with so you could meet him!\u201d he said, flapping a hand in Clint\u2019s direction, and his Dad actually rolled his eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know he\u2019s here to make sure you and Derek don\u2019t go at each other?\u201d and Stiles\u2019 mouth fell open in disbelief.\n\u201cThat\u2019s so unfair. I have no idea where you heard that from.\u201d the man just shook his head, stepping away from his son so he could offer Clint his hand.\n\u201cJohn Stilinski, it\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cClint Barton, same goes.\u201d John\u2019s expression showed clear surprise at his name and he turned to look back at his son.\n\u201cYou mean you\u2019re seeing the guy you were telling me was following you around when you first started with SHIELD?\u201d John said, and Clint felt the tips of his ears go hot. Stiles just grinned at his dad.\n\u201cSee, I knew I\u2019d told you something about him.\u201d and Clint just shot a look at Isaac who was snickering from where he lounged against the wall. John just gave a long suffering sigh before turning back to look at Clint.\n\u201cI would like to point out now that you chose this.\u201d and Clint looked from him to Stiles who was beaming at him. He couldn\u2019t help but offer what he knew was probably a ridiculous grin back.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d and this time when he looked back at John there was a soft smile on his face.\u00a0\n\u201cGood. Now come on, I know you\u2019re not actually here to introduce me to your boyfriend. You want to know about the witch.\u201d\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s always the freakin\u2019 Nemeton.\u201d Stiles scowled at the muddy ground they were being forced to wade through, muttering to himself. \u201cIt could never just be a good old murder house or something. No, of course it\u2019s the old, crazy, magical tree of doom that is literally to blame for every bad thing ever.\u201d Clint couldn\u2019t help but smirk as he followed Stiles\u2019 through the woods, amused by the muttering. At first, he\u2019d been a bit put out that they were going to be dealing with the witch before he got to see Derek, but then Allison and Natasha had shown up at the Sheriff\u2019s house with Lydia who had proceeded to tell everyone that they would be dealing with Derek while Stiles, Clint, and the rest of the wolves dealt with the witch. It had only taken Clint one look into Natasha\u2019s smug gaze to know that they\u2019d given her explicit permission to intimidate the alpha werewolf. After that, Clint couldn\u2019t find it in himself to be upset about it, because hands down Natasha was way scarier than he was. His smirk widened at the thought. Then he thought about Lydia, who\u2019d swept in and had such a presence that he could see why Stiles felt the way he did about her - and there was a fierceness to her when she\u2019d mentioned his injury that said it was mutual. Clint felt the change in the ground first and the smirk dropped from his face as he went tense, bow at the ready. It took him a moment to pin point the exact difference but when he did he realized the ground was vibrating ever so slightly beneath their feet. He glanced at the wolves first, wondering if they\u2019d felt it too, and by the tense expression he guessed they had, but when he followed their gazes to see where they were looking he found them all watching Stiles.\u00a0\n\u201cShe\u2019s been feeding it. The Nemeton. She\u2019s been feeding it with energy she\u2019s stealing from the pack. The energy from the pack bonds. It didn\u2019t just feel like they were gone - she was stealing them.\u201d And while his voice was flat, his eyes burned with his outrage. He turned to look at Clint then, and there was something almost like apology in his gaze. \u201cI should have told you before.\u201d He admitted, and Clint felt the beginning of worry.\u00a0\n\u201cStiles-\u201d and it was the dark haired wolf, Scott, who tried to cut in, but Stiles waved him off.\n\u201cScott, it\u2019s only fair.\u201d And Scott looked hesitant, but more than that, he looked just about ready to take out anyone who might even look at Stiles the wrong way.\u00a0\n\u201cTell me what?\u201d Clint prompted, because it was obvious that whatever Stiles wanted to say was important.\u00a0\n\u201cTony and Steve mentioned at the tower that I\u2019d said I had a Spark.\u201d He met Clint\u2019s gaze straight on and Clint realized it wasn\u2019t just emotion that brightened Stiles\u2019 eyes, instead they looked like warm honey lit with sunlight from behind, and Clint realized it was some sort of power doing this. \u201cIt means I can manipulate natural energy. Beacon Hills sits on a current.\u201d It was like electricity crackled along his skin and for someone who worked with super soldiers and the similarly enhanced on a regular basis Clint was more surprised he hadn\u2019t noticed anything this far out of the ordinary before. Now the earth seemed to ripple outwards but this time it was from where Stiles was standing, pushing back against whatever had disturbed the ground in the first place. Clint could almost feel where the ripples were pushed back towards them and grinned.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s like echo location.\u201d And it was Isaac who grinned back at him.\u00a0\n\u201cExactly. Sometimes he can actually make it so we can hear it as well as feel it, but it takes a lot of power.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDoes he have that kind of power?\u201d And for a moment it looked like Isaac\u2019s grin would slip, but then he looked at Stiles who was concentrating on finding the location of whatever the Nemeton was, and rather than slip it softened.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s hard on him. He only does it if we need it.\u201d And that fit exactly who Clint knew Stiles to be.\u00a0\n\u201cSo what exactly is a Nemeton?\u201d Clint asked, then, eyes tracking the direction of the ripples.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tree. Well. A tree stump. Basically it holds power but it feeds on power too and depending on what kind of power it\u2019s being fed means it either will draw in negative things or if it\u2019s positive energy then it\u2019s sort of kept even, I think? Stiles explained it to me once. He said it\u2019s not neutral exactly but at ease. I guess.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBasically what Isaac is saying is that if the Nemeton is happy, it means we\u2019re no longer sitting on a Hellmouth.\u201d The blonde female wolf, Erica, put in. The big broad man on her heels nodded in agreement. Stiles glanced back with a smirk.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost there. Erica, Boyd, I want you two to fan out to the left and then start circling back in about 30 feet. Isaac, Scott, you two will start to the right. We\u2019re going to keep circling forward until we find it. If anyone finds it first, howl.\u201d And everyone nodded before loping off. Clint just moved up to pace beside Stiles as they continued forwards.\u00a0\n\u201cDoes that make you Buffy?\u201d Clint asked as soon as the wolves were out of sight, and Stiles snickered. Then his expression sobered.\u00a0\n\u201cThe witch might be there. Lydia and Allison were pretty sure she was dead, that she was dragged under by the Nemeton, but I think she may still be alive, but barely. The Nemeton could have been feeding on the magic that would\u2019ve leaked out of her but it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be as strong and it shouldn\u2019t be able to hold her spell.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is why you think she\u2019s still alive.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. If she\u2019s nearly dead, she could be using the Nemeton to stay alive long enough to finish her curse.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean she\u2019s letting it eat her.\u201d Stiles glanced at him and grimaced.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I mean.\u201d\n\u201cHow long can she live like that?\u201d\n\u201cHard to say. But what I can tell you is that she can\u2019t ever come back from this sort of thing. Once she merged enough with the Nemeton for this to be possible, she signed her own death warrant, and she knows it. Her body probably barely exists anymore.\u201d\n\u201cThen how do we stop her?\u201d\n\u201cWe find her heart, and we crush it.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore Clint could ask anything further, like maybe, where the hell did they look for a heart whose body had already decomposed, the ground buckled and then rolled under their feet in an attempt to send them to their knees.\n\u201cIt knows we\u2019re coming.\u201d Stiles gritted out through his teeth, fighting to stay upright. \u201cWe have to be close.\u201d Clint nodded, and he pushed forward. He trusted Stiles to be able to hold his own and he could feel where the ripples in the earth were coming from now. Even as he moved ahead though he heard Stiles cry out for him to stop, but as he turned back the trees closed around him, cutting Stiles off from his site. A wind was picking up and Clint was pretty sure this was the very definition of eerie so he turned, weapon up and at the ready. He was faced with what looked more tree than woman; what he assumed had been the witch was sitting against the base of the stump, but she was completely covered in roots. The woman shifted and Clint realized with some horror that she actually was made of the roots now.\u00a0\n\u201cSo you\u2019re the Archer. The one our dear Spark has left us for.\u201d And her voice was like metal scraping against glass. Clint\u2019s answer was to bring his bow up and shoot, but the woman batted the arrow away, starting to step closer. She paused after only moving a foot - the roots that attached her to the tree tightening. She gave a hiss before turning her face back towards Clint. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you could do that could stop me.\u201d With a wave of her hand, the wind that had been swirling around them ripped the bow from his hand and it was full force hurricane now. The woman threw her arms out to either side now, looking up at the sky, the wood that made up her face twisting into a sinister smile.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat will you do now, Archer? You\u2019re alone and powerless. I have bound to the Nemeton. Together we are strong enough to rip this pack apart, starting with the Alpha.\u201d Then her gaze pinned him in place where he fought to stay upright. \u201cYou could help us. You have the strength of heart to do so.\u201d The words had Clint recoiling and the witch reached out for him. Roots bubbled out of the ground to latch onto him and he drew his knife, hacking away at them, but it was little to no use. He felt the panic start to stir as he was dragged towards the tree stump, cursing as he fell onto his back, air whooshing out of his lungs.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you turn me into a twig.\u201d He snapped, sawing at another root, and even as he said it, the forest seemed to boom inwards into the clearing. For a moment, Clint lay dazed and disoriented, unsure if the absolute silence was from a lack of hearing or not. That\u2019s when he heard Stiles\u2019 voice.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had just about enough of you trying to take things from me.\u201d There was a rush of power through the clearing and the witch cried out, falling back into the Nemeton, roots that made her up cracking. The ones around Clint\u2019s ankles crumbled and he scrambled to his feet, catching his bow even as Isaac tossed it to him. Then the wolves were surging forward, using their claws to break the witch apart even as the power Stiles threw forward kept her immobile. Clint saw the heart before he even realized what he was seeing, because in no way would he automatically connect the mass of black sludge and bark to be a heart, but then he saw the beat, the ba-bum ba-bum ba-bum thrumming, and he knew what it was. Taking a breath, he lifted his bow and let everything else fall aside as he drew his arrow. Then he let go.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou stopped the witch.\u201d It was years of having Natasha around that had alerted Clint that someone else was there, and years of training that didn\u2019t have him spinning, weapon in hand at the sound of Derek Hale\u2019s voice.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was a team effort.\u201d Clint said easily, turning slowly, almost lazily. He wanted Hale to know he didn\u2019t think he was a threat. He leaned back against the Sheriff's dining table where he\u2019d been cleaning his bow, crossing his arms across his chest. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d He\u2019d felt the once over Hale had given him the moment he saw him, knew he had nothing to prove, but he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little resentment for someone who\u2019d tried to pit Stiles against him and the team.\u00a0\n\u201cI know it\u2019s you.\u201d And Clint lifted a brow, unimpressed.\u00a0\n\u201cIs that so.\u201d He responded drily, and Hale scowled.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one Stiles is seeing. The one who\u2019s been living at his apartment. The one he hid from us.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou mean hid from you.\u201d Clint shot back, eyes hard. \u201cAnd from what I saw, he was right to.\u201d The wolf stepped forward, lips twisted in a snarl. \u201cThink you\u2019re going to scare me with the growling routine? That\u2019s old school, and not all that effective. You know what is?\u201d He shot forward without any warning, gun up and pointed at Hale\u2019s forehead and just far enough out of reach that the wolf couldn\u2019t stop him even if he wanted to. \u201cIf you ever hurt Stiles again, I promise you, my face will be the last thing you ever see.\u201d For a moment, the wolf just stared at him, but then he heaved a sigh, offering a nod.\u00a0\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d And Clint blinked in surprise, lowering the gun but not sliding it away. At the obvious surprise on his face, Hale huffed out what could almost be considered a laugh. \u201cStiles brings that out in people. The need to be better and the protective instinct. He\u2019s not very good at doing it himself.\u201d And it sounded almost like the wolf was giving him permission to date Stiles. Clint scowled.\u00a0\n\u201cYou want me to believe that that\u2019s it? You almost kicked him out of your pack for seeing me.\u201d And the alpha winced. Stiles had told him it had been the spell, but Clint wanted to see for himself.\u00a0\n\u201cI could never kick Stiles out, it\u2019s his pack as much as it\u2019s mine. The witch - she was trying to break the pack apart. Losing Stiles, and the power of his Spark that strengthens the pack bonds - it would cripple us.\u201d Then he huffed out another breath. \u201cAnd we\u2019re a family.\u201d He met Clint\u2019s gaze head on. \u201cWhat happened last time - it won\u2019t ever happen again.\u201d Clint huffed out a breath\u00a0He knew he could turn down the semi apology, but at the same time, he also knew that would make him the asshole. He slid away his gun and offered his hand.\n\u201cClint.\u201d The relief was instantaneous and his hand was accepted.\n\u201cDerek.\u201d\n\u201cGood to finally meet you.\u201d And the smile he got was almost disgustingly pure.\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\n\u201cI like him.\u201d Stiles rolled his eyes, letting his head fall back against the couch so he could see Derek hovering behind him. Derek just vaulted over so they were sitting next to each other. \u201cClint. I like him.\u201d He reiterated, and this time Stiles actually glared.\n\u201cDid you think you wouldn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Derek said honestly, and that had Stiles heaving a sigh, shifting around so he could shove a foot at Derek\u2019s thigh before throwing his feet in the other\u2019s lap.\u00a0\n\u201cI really was going to introduce you. It was just never a good time and things had gotten so crazy. We weren\u2019t official at first and what did you want me to do, tell you about every person I had sex with?\u201d Derek grimaced. \u201cExactly. And then when we were official it was sort of all at once. I mean we sort of established it before but it wasn\u2019t like, explicitly clear until after your meltdown at my apartment.\u201d Derek rested a hand over Stiles\u2019 ankle.\u00a0\n\u201cYou deserve someone as loyal as him.\u201d He admitted, and that caught Stiles by surprise. Not because he didn\u2019t know how loyal Clint was, but because he wasn\u2019t sure how Derek knew. Then he narrowed his eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Derek smirked.\n\u201cThreatened me.\u201d And Stiles knew the only reason Derek was telling him was because he was impressed.\n\u201cYou guys are so fucking weird.\u201d He grumbled, but it was affectionate. Then the feeling slid aside and Stiles sighed again. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving SHIELD. I\u2019m going back with him.\u201d And Derek nodded.\n\u201cI know. But maybe next time you come home, you should bring him.\u201d That had Stiles blinking in surprise.\n\u201cReally?\u201d And Derek\u2019s smirk softened.\n\u201cIt would be good to meet him when someone\u2019s life isn\u2019t in danger.\u201d Derek said drily, and Stiles shifted so he could launch himself across the couch, wrapping Derek in a hug. When he finally shifted back, he settled right in against Derek\u2019s side.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen do you think we should tell him that he\u2019s pretty much agreed to step-parent an unruly pack of werewolves?\u201d Derek wasted no time shoving him off the couch.\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nStiles heard the knock on his Dad's\u00a0front door from his old bedroom but decided to ignore it. His Dad was downstairs and nobody he knew actually knocked the door. They usually just came right in, and if they knocked on anything it was the windowsill. Satisfied, he curled further into Clint\u2019s side, earning a sleepy mumble from the archer. Clint turned, nuzzling into Stiles\u2019 neck even as he tightened his arms around the younger man.\u00a0\n\u201cMornin\u2019.\u201d Clint murmured, and Stiles groaned.\n\u201cStill sleeping.\u201d Was the reply, and he felt Clint smile against his neck before nipping gently. This time Stiles gave a hum, throwing an arm around Clint\u2019s back. \u201cMaybe I could get on board with that.\u201d Before they could take that thought any further, John was shouting up the stairs.\n\u201cStiles, Clint. You\u2019ve got a visitor. Come deal with this before it draws attention.\u201d And that was definitely exasperation in his Dad\u2019s voice. They both froze, Clint pulling away so they could meet each other\u2019s gaze. Then Stiles\u2019 mouth widened into a grin.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s Tony. I win the bet.\u201d And he was on his feet and out of the bedroom with a cackle. Clint rolled his eyes, giving chase. He came to a stop right behind where Stiles skidded to a halt in the front hall, and Clint couldn\u2019t help himself, he burst out laughing. Tony was indeed standing on the front porch, shades low on his face so he could meet their gaze while he judged them. What had Clint laughing was the sedan at the curb where he could see at least Steve in the car.\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t invite us to the meet and greet with actual werewolves. Is this what happens when we don\u2019t sleep with you?\u201d Tony wondered out loud, and Stiles sputtered, John clearing his throat behind them all. Tony just looked smug but Clint rolled his eyes, moving forward to sling an arm around Stiles.\u00a0\n\u201cCan it, Stark. You\u2019re just jealous I found him first.\u201d And that had Tony giving a vague hum, pushing his glasses back up.\u00a0\n\u201cCome on, grandpa\u2019s waiting in the car. Aren\u2019t dog parents obligated to introduce their pets to everyone?\u201d Tony quipped, and John actually gave a loud sigh behind them.\n\u201cIf he gets himself mauled, cover it up.\u201d John warned his son. \u201cI will not be held responsible for whatever happens at the Hale house.\u201d Stiles cackled.\n\u201cYou got it, pops.\u201d Stiles responded cheekily, then he turned to Tony. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right out. Try not to draw too much attention.\u201d And his tone was dry as the desert.\u00a0\n\u201cMe? Draw attention?\u201d He turned away and Stiles could only shake his head. What had his life even become?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\nThe large stack of paperwork had Stiles jerking in surprise when it dropped onto his desk, and he blinked up at Coulson who was watching him with a very obvious lack of sympathy. Stiles just knew all of his random absences and late days were about to bite him in the ass.\n\u201cThis is the paperwork that needs to be filled out for all unaccounted work hours as well as the reports that are supposed to be completed on the occurrence of any incidents involving SHIELD agents, as well as reports to be completed on any incidents involving active Avengers.\u201d Stiles just looked from the paperwork to Coulson again before nodding.\n\u201cFair enough. When does it all have to be done by?\u201d Coulson gave that funny little half smile that absolutely meant approval. He walked away without a word and Stiles just stared after him in confusion. Then he was back with another stack of paperwork. He dropped it on Stiles\u2019 desk and when the agent just stared blankly at that pile, actually cracked a real smile.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is the paperwork involving a new species of inhuman.\u201d Then he pulled up a chair, pushing that pile towards Stiles and pulling the incident stack towards himself. \u201cIf we start now, we should be done before agent Barton comes to collect you for the evening.\u201d Stiles felt the flush crawl up his face all the way to the tips of his ears and watched the smile flicker briefly back onto Coulson\u2019s features before his senior officer settled in to work. Stiles immediately followed suit, digging into his own stack of paperwork. He glanced at Coulson out of the corner of his eye and couldn\u2019t help his own smile. He\u2019d never really imagined that he\u2019d be in this position - that he\u2019d find people outside of the pack that he could even begin to care about just as much. He looked back to his own work, ducking down to hide his smile. He hadn\u2019t imagined he\u2019d be able to find it, but he was pretty damn glad he had.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
