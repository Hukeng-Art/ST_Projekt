    "text": "Luke barely has enough time to stagger to his rooms, wash his face, and strip off his filthy robes before his comlink chimes-- The presence of Knight Skywalker is requested immediately by the Jedi High Council , because of course it is, of course Luke can\u2019t have five minutes to himself to wash the blood out of his--and Luke sighs and releases his frustration into the Force, where it swirls around him like little gnats before being swept away.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s bowing to the Council three minutes later, hair damp at the temples, skin of his back itching under drying bacta. He rolls his shoulders as he straightens, one at a time, and all that does is hurt. He hadn\u2019t realized the burn on his shoulder was quite so bad--it was hard to notice it at all, frankly, what with the shards of durasteel he\u2019d had to dig out of his back--until two minutes ago when he\u2019d gone to slap a bandage on it and hadn\u2019t had enough gauze in his fresher. He\u2019d just thrown a tunic on and decided to deal with the consequences later.\nThere\u2019s not much time for Luke to contemplate the misery waiting for him when he has to take his tunic off because the Council, with zero pleasantries, gets to the point immediately. \u201cGone to a Child of the Watch, the Darksaber has,\u201d Grand Master Yoda announces in his creaky little voice. \u201cPeace, there is not, and yet peace, there must be.\u201d\nLuke, perplexed, stares at him for what feels like probably an embarrassing amount of time.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sending you to Mandalore,\u201d Master Tano clarifies. \u201cTo broker a peaceful transition of power.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d Luke echoes, looking across the weathered, troubled faces of the Council. \u201cUh,\u201d he continues, when all he gets back a narrow-eyed stare from the Grand Master, \u201cthat is--brokering negotiations isn\u2019t really my, uh--\u201d and then he trails off, because what Luke\u2019s inability to conduct basic diplomacy is is a personal failing that has haunted him since he first became a padawan, nearly twenty years ago.\n\u201cI\u2019m coming with you, Luke,\u201d Master Kenobi says, taking pity on Luke after only a few seconds of awkward silence. \u201cAlthough I have not met the new Mand\u2019alor, I am familiar with the political situation there.\u201d\nLuke does not ask,  then why in kriffing hell are you also sending me , but the thought must make its way to his face because Master Secura lifts a hand to her mouth in what is clearly an attempt to hide a smile. \u201cMandalorians can be difficult,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have found over the years that they respond best to the presence of our more formidable Knights.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s been a few years since I last dazzled an audience with my lightsaber technique,\u201d Master Kenobi adds drily. Although he\u2019s hardly as ancient as Grand Master Yoda, who looks more shriveled by the hour these days, Master Kenobi is old for a human Jedi. That bit about his Soresu is a load of bantha shit, all the same--Luke\u2019s seen him fight as recently as two years ago and he\u2019d dismantled an entire battalion of Separatist-era battle droids almost single-handedly.\u00a0\nBut it is true that Luke has a reputation for violence that is rare amongst Jedi. When he\u2019d fought the last known living Sith last year, Luke hadn\u2019t stopped to ask  what if someone records this and puts it on the holonet  because he\u2019d been too busy trying not to die or let his sister and her diplomatic attach\u00e9s be murdered. But the footage had been literally everywhere for months and he\u2019s still feeling its aftershocks reverberating through his life. The Council had suggested that Luke maybe stop interviewing padawan candidates for the time being. There had been a Senate hearing, which had been excruciating for many reasons, not the least of which being that Luke\u2019s mother is the kriffing Supreme Chancellor and his sister is the junior senator from Naboo.\nIt\u2019s hard to blame the Council, really. Too many decades of hard work have gone into restoring the Jedi Order\u2019s reputation as peacemakers and diplomats to have it all fall apart just because Luke keeps accidentally stumbling across angry Darksiders and violent leaders of organized crime syndicates during otherwise routine missions.\nNonetheless, Luke lets himself feel a bare second of irritation before exhaling, quietly, and releasing it into the Force.  There is no chaos, there is harmony , he reminds himself. It\u2019s the part of the Jedi Code that he has always struggled with the most; Luke often seems to cause chaos just by existing.\u00a0\n\u201cRight, okay,\u201d Luke says.  Harmony, harmony, harmony . \u201cWhen do we leave, Master?\u201d\n~\nAfter the Council releases him, Luke takes a speeder over to Leia\u2019s apartment. She\u2019s lived for the last few years on the top floor of a squat little duracrete antique within spitting distance of the much more luxurious high-rise where their parents have an apartment. Leia had denied its selection as any kind of political statement but the holonet had been full of breathless headlines for weeks afterwards: CHANCELLOR AMIDALA\u2019S DAUGHTER REJECTS LUXURY FOR EGALITARIAN EXISTENCE, the usual ignorant bantha shit about how Leia\u2019s upbringing in the Jedi Order had taught her to eschew material concerns, which was the kind of thing only somebody who\u2019d never seen her hairpin collection would say.\u00a0\nAs he\u2019s parking his speeder on the roof, Luke sends an inquiring tendril down to Leia\u2019s apartment, just to be polite. There are two familiar Force signatures inside, one so bright and dear to Luke that it\u2019s like looking in a mirror, the other a pinprick of sullen, resentful competence. It\u2019s been ten years and Han still acts like being Force-sensitive is a communicable illness. \u201cI thought Han was off-world?\u201d Luke says when Leia answers the door.\n\u201cHe just got back,\u201d Leia tells him sourly.\n\u201cIf I\u2019d known this was the kind of reception I\u2019d get, I\u2019d\u2019ve stayed where I was actually wanted!\u201d Han hollers from deeper in the apartment.\nLuke shrugs off his cloak and hangs it on one of the hooks by the door. \u201cDeal gone bad?\u201d he asks Leia in a low undertone as she slams the door shut.\n\u201cI can\u2019t be implicated if I don\u2019t know the details,\u201d Leia says, which is both a lie and a slanderous interpretation of her own character. She looks exhausted; there are deep circles under her eyes and her hair, although neatly braided up and around her head, looks less shiny than usual. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ben?\u201d\n\u201cHe was already asleep when I got away from the Council,\u201d Luke says apologetically. \u201cHe\u2019s still got that cold--the cr\u00e8chemaster said he slept most of the day. It seemed better to leave him.\u201d\nLeia looks even more haggard for a long moment and then she shakes her shoulders back and straightens up, that characteristic Senator Skywalker gleam coming back into her eye. \u201cThat was the right decision,\u201d she says. \u201cThanks for checking on him. I\u2019ll go by the Temple tomorrow and see how he\u2019s feeling.\u201d She goes to pull Luke in for a hug and then pauses, her hands extended towards his shoulder. \u201cWhat happened to  you ?\u201d\n\u201cExplosives,\u201d Luke says shortly. \u201cThe bacta will sort it out eventually. Come on, then,\u201d and he snatches her for a quick hug, trying to ignore the way the movement pulls painfully at something deep in his back. \u201cHow\u2019s my favorite sister doing, then?\u201d\n\u201cRun off my feet but fine otherwise,\u201d Leia says. She settles for hugging his head instead of his torso, clearly able to tell that Luke\u2019s too battered for much else. \u201cYou usually only come by when you\u2019re headed off-world--don\u2019t tell me they\u2019re sending you out again?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s sounding a little judgemental coming from the worst workaholic I know,\u201d Luke points out, releasing her before his shoulder really begins screaming. He takes a second to focus on his physical pain and then drops it into the Force--and good riddance, too. It\u2019s not a sustainable solution but it\u2019ll keep him upright until he can spare a few hours for a healing trance.\n\u201cI\u2019m the only one allowed to bully you, you know that,\u201d Leia says, frowning up at him. \u201cWeren\u2019t you escorting an AgriCorps relief freighter to Jakku? Why were there explosives?\u201d\n\u201cAt least give the man some food before interrogating him, princess,\u201d Han shouts from the kitchen.\nLeia has a good point, of course. Escorting AgriCorps relief freighters to ravaged planets is an extremely commonplace assignment for Jedi Knights and it\u2019s only ever a little bit dangerous. Most of the other Knights view escort duty as a kind of sabbatical. It\u2019s probably not surprising that  Luke  always manages to land the AgriCorps assignments that are disasters waiting to happen. This time it had been raiders interested in the energy cell for the freighter\u2019s hydroponics system, but last time it had been bounty hunters--apparently AgriCorps specialists are a hot commodity in the Outer Rim slave markets, being both Force-sensitive and great at growing food on desert planets--and the time before that it had been a Darksider in the wrong place at the wrong time who\u2019d clearly been itching to fight somebody in Jedi robes.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t cook, did you?\u201d Luke asks her.\nLeia gives him a dirty look. \u201cWe ordered in,\u201d she says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d Han yells.\n~\nWaking up in hyperspace is always a little bit of a rude shock for Luke. It takes him a few seconds to get his bearings as his sleepy, instinctual interrogation of the Force flails around trying to find another life form--for a long, dragging breath it\u2019s as though he\u2019s back on the AgriCorps freighter just as the hull had ruptured, the chilly hand of the vacuum of space reaching for him--and then he inhales, centers himself, and feels Master Kenobi\u2019s unassuming signature in the cockpit of their ship.\n\u201cMorning, Master,\u201d Luke says as he climbs into the cockpit. He\u2019s juggling two cups of caf and a datapad with as much information on the Children of the Watch as the Chief Librarian could chase down in a few hours. Which is to say: next to nothing.\u00a0\n\u201cGood morning, Luke,\u201d Master Kenobi says, accepting the cup of caf that Luke offers as he drops into the co-pilot\u2019s seat.\nNothing in his expression or presence in the Force betrays his disgust, but Luke knows it\u2019s still there. \u201cI\u2019ll work on the kettle today,\u201d he says in lieu of an actual apology, which he knows Master Kenobi would refuse to accept.\n\u201cI appreciate your concern, Luke, but despite what the Temple rumor mill might suggest, I do not subsist solely on tea,\u201d Master Kenobi says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem, Master,\u201d Luke tells him, downing a hurried gulp of caf and then just as hurriedly releasing the pain of his burned tongue into the Force. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a lot else to fill my time. Is this really all that the Chief Librarian could find?\u201d He uses his thumb to page through the datapad\u2019s directory index. Two texts on religious cults from a specialist at the University of Sundari, a handful of articles from back-issues of  The Keldabe Review , and extremely grainy cam footage of the fight that had lost Bo-Katan Kryze the Darksaber. \u201cWho recorded the footage?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear,\u201d Master Kenobi replies, staring thoughtfully down into his cup of caf. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the whole stunt was part of a premeditated grab for power. It would be rather difficult for Bo-Katan or her nephew to deny the legitimate transfer of ownership of the Darksaber with such clear evidence to the contrary.\u201d And then, very drily: \u201cNot, of course, that Bo-Katan would ever stoop to such dishonorable methods.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re familiar with the Kryze clan, Master?\u201d Luke asks. He\u2019s heard the rumors, of course, but it\u2019s impossible to know how accurate any of those old stories might be. He probably does not manage to sound as innocent as he wants, because Master Kenobi shoots him an eyebrow that manages to be both amused and disappointed.\n\u201cFurther grist from the mills, Knight Skywalker?\u201d he says.\nLuke can feel himself flush. \u201cI know it\u2019s probably mostly gossip,\u201d he says. \u201cI was just wondering.\u201d\nMaster Kenobi says, \u201cNo, I did not have a torrid affair with Duchess Satine Kryze,\u201d so mildly that it takes Luke a second to catch on, at which point he immediately chokes on his mouthful of caf. A small smile twitches at the corner of Master Kenobi\u2019s mouth. \u201cThe situation on Mandalore was always an untenable one, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he continues, gracefully ignoring Luke\u2019s attempt to drown in his beverage. \u201cA detente between the various Mandalorian factions was feasible under Bo-Katan but it was always going to die with her.\u201d\n\u201cI know Bo-Katan\u2019s nephew is a New Mandalorian, but is he a true pacifist?\u201d Luke asks, unable to shake the feeling that he ought to already know the answer to this. He asks the question anyway.  Everybody looks like an idiot sometimes  , Master Windu had frequently told him during his time as a padawan.  No point in pretending dignity if it\u2019s the difference between making the right decision or a wrong one that could get people killed .\u00a0\n\u201cNot quite as stringent as the former Duchess,\u201d Master Kenobi says. \u201cBut he certainly isn\u2019t a warrior, and that is what one needs to be to hold the Darksaber against challengers.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why the New Mandalorians kept the tradition of the Darksaber,\u201d Luke says. \u201cIts very existence is antithesis to a peaceful transition of power. You would think they\u2019d want to drop-kick it off a cliff somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t until Bo-Katan used it,\u201d Master Kenobi says. \u201cUnfortunately, the Mandalorian factions could not be united without it.\u201d He\u2019d be the one to know; he\u2019s taught Advanced Topics in Galactic History and Intraplanetary Negotiation for the last thirty years. \u201cTheir culture is a very old one, Luke. They take pride in it.\u201d\n\u201cThe oldest enemy of the Jedi,\u201d Luke quips, feeling the phantom ache of Grand Master Yoda\u2019s gimmer stick against the backs of his calves.  Pride there is not! Only peace and submission! \nMaster Kenobi hums, not quite in agreement, and they settle into a comfortable silence as they finish their cups of caf and turn back to their briefing texts. The lights of hyperspace dance across the surface of Luke\u2019s datapad as he tries his best to read; eventually, the hypnotic lights and the rhythmic thump of his pulse in his injured shoulder pull him back into sleep.\n~\nIt\u2019s immediately apparent upon their arrival that no one is pleased to welcome Jedi to Mandalore. Although Luke had expected as much, he\u2019s a little startled by the outright hostility he feels radiating from the various helmeted heads awaiting them on the landing pad jutting out from the side of Sundari\u2019s massive dome. The air on Mandalore is dry and ravaged; it whips down Luke\u2019s throat in the few minutes that they\u2019re exposed and he coughs into his fist to clear out the worst of the sand as he follows Master Kenobi to their waiting hosts.\n\u201cGeneral Kenobi,\u201d one of them says, with a hiss that seems not completely attributable to interference from their helmet speaker.\n\u201cI am a general no longer,\u201d Master Kenobi says calmly, folding his hands into the sleeves of his robes.\n\u201cJedi, then,\u201d the speaker allows. \u201cBe welcomed once more to Sundari.\u201d It sounds like they have to eke the words out from between their teeth.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to be back,\u201d Master Kenobi replies.\nThey all stand there for a few seconds, Master Kenobi looking blandly helpful, the various helmeted Mandalorians feeling like they\u2019re seething impotently at something, Luke trying not to inhale too much sand, and then the Mandalorians turn on their heels and stalk towards the entrance to the dome. \u201cYou must be presented to the Mand\u2019alor,\u201d the same speaker throws over their shoulder.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Master Kenobi says mildly.\nInside of the dome, Sundari looks sort of like a miniaturized Coruscant, with tall buildings all jostled in together and speeder traffic threaded amongst them. Luke can sense that not all of the life inside of the dome is sentient; there are trees and shrubs growing off of the sides of the buildings, reaching for the artificial sunlight. Something is in flowering season, dusting the air with clouds of pale pink pollen.\n\u201cCome along, Luke,\u201d Master Kenobi chides when Luke falls too far behind the not-so-welcoming welcome committee, the members of which are using narrow walkways to make their speedy way across the upper level. They\u2019re making a beeline for the most impressive structure of the bunch, which looks like a huge transparisteel box nestled at the very center of the city.\nPerhaps what is most striking about Sundari is how very normal it seems. Luke has not met very many Mandalorians, mostly ex-troopers and bounty hunters, but he wouldn\u2019t term any of them  normal . It\u2019s impossible for him to imagine Boba Fett frollicking in a public park, for example, like the people Luke can just make out on top of a nearby mid-height building. There are children screaming with bright laughter as they chase each other into and out of shrubs and fountains. Luke can feel his shoulder, still a little tight with pain and new scar tissue, loosen at the familiar sound of shrieks echoing off of burbling water.\nLuke and Master Kenobi are not welcomed to the palace of the Mand\u2019alor with very much fanfare. They\u2019re ushered in a side door and then through a series of rooms, including a cavernous and empty one that has a very large chair off at one end, until they\u2019re left outside of a set of double doors being monitored by a pair of protocol droids that nervously disappear inside. After a few minutes one of them reappears and says, \u201cYou are made quite welcome, good sirs, and encouraged to introduce yourselves posthaste,\u201d making a repeated beckoning motion with one of its arms.\nInside is a conference room containing two helmeted Mandalorians in very, very imposing armor, a redheaded woman whose helmet is tucked under her arm, and two people who aren\u2019t wearing armor at all. One of them is a man who looks, frankly, alarmingly like Master Kenobi.\nThere\u2019s a beat of silence before the woman holding her helmet under her arm says, with a flicker of clear frustration, \u201cOf course they sent  you .\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a pleasure to visit Mandalore,\u201d Master Kenobi says, bowing to her. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, Bo-Katan.\u201d\n\u201cI requested Ahsoka Tano,\u201d says the man who looks like Master Kenobi. He must be Korkie Kryze.\n\u201cShe sends her regrets,\u201d Master Kenobi murmurs. \u201cUrgent Council business has required her presence elsewhere.\u201d By which he means: general Council policy is not to acknowledge requests for specific individuals.  They\u2019ll get who they get and be grateful for it , Master Windu had once bellowed during a Council holocall in a rare display of true temper; rich, entitled Core Worlds never failed to get his back up. Mandalore is pretty far from being rich, entitled, or the Core but Korkie has a look about him that just screams aristocrat.\nAfter a tense few seconds Bo-Katan turns to the man at the head of the conference table. He stands with his arms folded against his chest and his legs spread, as though he is braced for blaster fire to start at any moment. Bo-Katan says, \u201cThis is General Obi-Wan Kenobi.\u201d\n\u201cI am a general no longer,\u201d Master Kenobi demures, with his apparently bottomless well of patience. \u201cThank you for the invitation, Mand\u2019alor,\u201d he continues, followed by something in Mando\u2019a that Luke--mostly fluent in curses--can\u2019t quite follow. Something about welcoming the opportunity to be a guest.\nBo-Katan\u2019s hard eyes flick from Master Kenobi over to Luke. There\u2019s a moment of recognition swiftly followed by confusion that is very, very familiar to Luke--Luke has mentally designated the latter the  wait he\u2019s too short  pause--and then she shakes it off and turns to Master Kenobi, demanding, \u201cWho accompanies you?\u201d\n\u201cJedi Knight Luke Skywalker,\u201d Master Kenobi says. He and Luke bow in unison to the Mand\u2019alor. He isn\u2019t the tallest man in the room, nor the most physically imposing, but his armor is almost unbelievably shiny and it\u2019s strangely threatening. After a few seconds\u2019 contemplation, Luke realizes why: it\u2019s made of pure beskar. It exists in the Force as something that is almost perpendicular to life.\n\u201cJedi,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor says after a long few seconds. He has an unexpectedly soft voice. \u201cThe Kryze clan says you are mediators.\u201d\n\u201cWe often serve as such,\u201d Master Kenobi allows.\n\u201cGreat,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor says. \u201cThen you can mediate them into taking this kriffing saber back.\u201d\n~\nIt takes a while for the shouting to die down. There\u2019s a lot of chaos--Bo-Katan slamming her helmet onto the table, yelling about tradition, Korkie loudly saying something also about tradition that sounds like he nonetheless is disagreeing with Bo-Katan, the protocol droids hurriedly circling the room, trying to calm everyone down--as the Mand\u2019alor sighs in a long crackle of static, his helmet drooping. The other Mandalorian in full armor, the one with the fur cloak, says something that does not quite make it to Luke\u2019s ears, murmur murmur  the way . And there, in the middle: Master Kenobi. A tendril of satisfied anticipation curls out of him before being swept away into the Force. In this moment, he reminds Luke of no one so much as Leia, who always treats the seconds before she launches herself into an argument like she\u2019s savoring the opening moves of a saber bout. Even if Luke had been extremely jealous in a way unbecoming of a Jedi when Master Kenobi had asked Leia to be his padawan, he can acknowledge now that they were a very good match.\nLuke has only just settled out of the way in a corner where he can come to Master Kenobi\u2019s aid if so required when the other Mandalorian without armor sidles over to his side. \u201cSkywalker?\u201d he says, intonation clearly making it an inquiry. \u201cI thought Jedi weren\u2019t allowed to have children.\u201d\n I thought politicians weren\u2019t allowed to ask rude questions , Luke thinks. \u201cWas that question?\u201d he says instead.\nBoth eyebrows go up. \u201cSo you\u2019re  not  the kid of the Hero With No Fear?\u201d The New Mandalorian feels a horrible swirl of aggression and excitement as he asks this; it\u2019s impossible to tell if he\u2019s angry at Anakin Skywalker or hungry for information about a personal hero. Perhaps it\u2019s both. Luke\u2019s father had killed a lot of people during the Clone Wars. Everyone has complicated feelings about him.\nThis is not the first time somebody has tried to pump Luke for information about his father. Luke\u2019s standard policy is to give the most useless answers possible; a polite  yes  or  no , interspersed with the default Jedi hum of acknowledgement, which they didn\u2019t teach you as a youngling but everybody picked up from their master eventually.\nLuke dusts off his hum of acknowledgement and folds his hands into the sleeves of his robe, eyes moving pointedly towards the knot of people yelling at each other across the conference table.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to invite the comparison, you should try not dressing like him,\u201d the man suggests, some kind of sharp emotion jabbing out of him.\nLuke makes his hum of acknowledgement go up in pitch at the end:  oh, really? \nThe man is recalled to the table by Korkie before he has a chance to try a different tactic, although there\u2019s a gleam to his eyes that suggests he\u2019ll be revisiting this line of inquiry at another time. He\u2019s welcome to try, but Luke had once spent three days suspended by his ankles over a rancor pit while various Hutts poked him with vibrospears and he hadn\u2019t told them anything about his father, so somehow he doubts a New Mandalorian pacifist is going to accomplish much.\n~\nLuke and Master Kenobi share a quiet meal in their quarters that evening. They\u2019ve been tucked away in a suite with tall transparisteel windows looking out over the city. The artificial sun is beginning to dim and it\u2019s difficult to make out the walls of the dome in the gloom. \u201cNew Mandalorians and most of the martial traditionalists will share meals with guests,\u201d Master Kenobi tells Luke over their plates of curried qana beans and stewed Mandalorian oranges, \u201cbut the Children of the Watch do not.\u201d\n\u201cThe helmet thing?\u201d Luke asks, stuffing a spoonful of stewed oranges into his mouth. Master Kenobi, as is his wont, is picking at his qana beans but not really eating anything. When they were thirteen, only a few years into their time as padawans, Leia had told Luke that she was pretty sure her master got all of his calories from tea.  Does Master Windu eat?  she\u2019d asked Luke.  I think my master gets all of his calories from eating his emotions , he\u2019d told her.\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Master Kenobi says. \u201cTheir doctrine requires their face go unobserved by any other living creature, although it seems that exceptions may be made for close family members--spouses, children.\u201d He gives Luke a very dry look. \u201cCasual lovers do not merit the privilege.\u201d\nLuke feels the tip of his ears go red. \u201cIs that a warning, Master?\u201d\n\u201cSimply some advice,\u201d Master Kenobi says mildly.\n\u201cNow who\u2019s listening too much to the Temple rumor mill?\u201d Luke says. He\u2019s taken lovers, of course, and had gotten the occasional condescending eyebrow from Master Windu about it along with one very embarrassing conversation during a mission on Tatooine when he was nineteen about properly shielding a master-padawan training bond when otherwise distracted, but never anything for which he\u2019d needed to be reprimanded.\n\u201cWell, we old masters have to live vicariously through the adventures of spry young knights,\u201d Master Kenobi says.\u00a0\nLuke rolls his eyes. \u201cEven if that wasn\u2019t a load of bantha shit, you should just watch a holodrama or something. Leia made me watch an episode of this new one when I went over to have dinner with her and Han before we left--it\u2019s about a MediCorps team stationed in Wild Space who\u2019re all sleeping with each other and having screaming arguments in between ridiculous medical procedures.\u201d\nMaster Kenobi says, mouth pursed, \u201cHow very thrilling.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019ve never actually been in a bacta tank or met a Jedi it\u2019s probably entertaining enough,\u201d Luke says. \u201cHan claimed to hate it but he had pretty strong feelings about why one of the MediCorps Jedi ought to leave her current girlfriend for the knight that had rejected her as a padawan--\u201d and then, to Master Kenobi\u2019s moue of distaste, \u201c--yeah, I know, but it\u2019s not like the girlfriend was much better, to be honest with you.\u201d\n\u201cNo one has ever claimed your brother-in-law has particularly good taste,\u201d Master Kenobi says.\n\u201cOuch!\u201d Luke grins at him. \u201cDon\u2019t say that too loud, Leia might hear.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you find your sister?\u201d Master Kenobi asks, and somehow Luke suspects that at least part of this conversation had been engineered to lead them around to this point. Luke doesn\u2019t pretend to completely understand the relationship a master and padawan develop when the padawan decides not to undertake their Trials and instead goes and becomes the true nemesis of the Jedi Order--which is to say: a politician--but he\u2019s always thought that Master Kenobi and Leia handled it surprisingly well.\n\u201cTired,\u201d Luke says, deciding after a long second\u2019s contemplation that it\u2019s probably for the best just to be honest. \u201cI\u2019m not really following this session of the Senate but I think some of her projects aren\u2019t doing well. Han\u2019s being--you know. Han. And Ben\u2019s been sick on and off for months now, so she\u2019s worried.\u201d\nMaster Kenobi trots out the standard little lecture about how the illnesses of the cr\u00e8che are good for a youngling\u2019s immune system, familiar to Luke as old boots after Ben\u2019s myriad ear infections, and then he stirs his cooling qana beans for a few seconds and continues, voice still even and friendly, \u201cAnakin mentioned that Leia seemed a little careworn, the last time they were able to speak.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting involved,\u201d Luke says immediately.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking you to,\u201d Master Kenobi says, like a liar.\n\u201cDad and Leia will figure it out,\u201d Luke says. \u201cI\u2019m not getting involved. I got involved once and neither of them spoke to me for ten weeks.\u201d\n\u201cNo one has asked that you involve yourself, Luke,\u201d Master Kenoi says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why they\u2019re fighting, and I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d Luke says. \u201cGo pump someone else for information. Han probably knows. Mom  definitely  knows.\u201d\n\u201cI simply wondered if your sister had shared her concerns with you,\u201d Master Kenobi says, soothing and full of shit.\nLuke says, \u201cShe hasn\u2019t,\u201d and stuffs a huge spoonful of stewed oranges into his mouth so he\u2019s physically incapable of responding to any more inquiries. Master Kenobi had basically raised Luke\u2019s father and Leia had been his padawan for twelve years; you\u2019d think he\u2019d know better, by now. If they want to fight, nothing in the galaxy can stop them from doing so.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you inherited your mother\u2019s temper, Luke,\u201d Master Kenobi says.\n\u201cYeph,\u201d Luke agrees around his mouthful of orange gruel.\n~\nLuke always wakes with the sun; it happens on planets that orbit more than one star, like Tatooine, and it proves true even in a city under a dome with zero exposure to sunlight. Master Windu, who had not been fond of mornings, had once irritably told Luke that it was possible to listen  too  well to the will of the Force and perhaps Luke ought to meditate on the subject for another two hours.\u00a0\nDespite his master\u2019s grumblings, Luke has always found it hard to sleep past the moment when the sun rises on a planet. He feels solar light as a kind of hot, questing touch and its curiosity and interest are difficult to ignore.\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t bother, that first full day in Sundari. He rolls out of bed, washes his face in the extremely fancy fresher, and goes to find somewhere he can practice his saber forms. There\u2019s not much in the way of open space in the palace itself, which seems entirely composed of conference rooms, but Luke follows the winding path from the day before to the side-door leading outside and wanders around the upper-level walkways until he finds an empty little park on top of what feels like an apartment building.\nLuke doesn\u2019t realize he has an audience until nearly two hours have passed. Although he is principally a user of the sixth form, he\u2019d spent most of his adolescence being brutally beaten into the ground by Master Windu\u2019s Vaapad exercises and he still finds them useful when he\u2019s cut adrift in his own emotions. The sixth form is a practical choice for a Jedi Knight like Luke, who has more Force sensitivity than he necessarily knows what to do with and often ends up in scrapes where intuition and creativity are his best hope of getting out alive, but that doesn\u2019t make it particularly suited for fostering mindfulness.\nThe counterpoint to which is, of course, that immersing oneself in a form like Vaapad can result in complete lack of awareness of one\u2019s surroundings. Luke finishes his final exercise and sends a tendril of Force awareness back towards the palace, trying to determine if Master Kenobi is awake yet, and he\u2019s immediately distracted by a much closer presence he recognizes: that perpendicular slide, like the Force is reflecting off of itself.\n\u201cMand\u2019alor,\u201d Luke says on a choked gasp, half-turning towards the presence. The Mand\u2019alor\u2019s arms are crossed, hand within half a second\u2019s reach of the blaster at his hip. He\u2019s standing between Luke and the fountain at the middle of the green; the artificial light of Sundari\u2019s false sun is mostly behind him, creating a strange halo around his beskar armor. \u201cEr. Good morning.\u201d Luke thumbs off his lightsaber and clips it to his belt. He looks around, suddenly worried that he\u2019s somewhere he ought not to be. The little park appears to still be mostly empty, but maybe the ferocity of Vaapad in action had scared off its normal denizens. \u201cI\u2019m not in the way--?\u201d\n\u201cLittle late to worry about that,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor says. And then, perhaps in response to Luke\u2019s guilty flush, he adds, \u201cProbably not, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Luke says lamely. \u201cOkay, great. I\u2019m glad.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long silence. Something in the Mand\u2019alor\u2019s bearing suggests that he\u2019d be completely comfortable never speaking. Luke has, unfortunately, never been that kind of person. \u201cAre you interested in saber forms?\u201d\nThe Mand\u2019alor\u2019s helmet tilts a little to the side. \u201cYou offering?\u201d he finally says.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not--I\u2019m just a knight,\u201d Luke explains. Why is he so flustered? \u201cI haven\u2019t trained anyone. But, uh, Master Kenobi trained my sister. He\u2019s considered one of the greatest living practitioners of the third form.\u201d\nThe Mand\u2019alor says, \u201cIs that what you were doing?\u201d\nLuke licks his lips. He\u2019s starting to feel the physical effects of spending two hours with the seventh form--dehydration, muscle exhaustion--his kriffing shoulder --\n\u201cThat\u2019s a variant of the seventh,\u201d he says, rolling his shoulder. It feels like his shirt is stuck to his skin; he must not have applied a large enough bandage. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be offensive, but, uh, it\u2019s not usually taught to people that aren\u2019t Jedi. It\u2019s considered pretty dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cLooked fancy,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor says, with just a faint hint of disapproving dismissal. He might as well have said,  pretty with no substance .\nWithout quite meaning to, Luke lets out a bark of laughter. \u201cFancy is one way of describing it,\u201d he says. It had been fancy enough to take Darth Sidious\u2019 head off, for sure.\n\u201cThese--forms,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor says, slowly, like he\u2019s feeling the word out for its proper use. \u201cThis is the way of the Jedi? To follow a form?\u201d He gives an unfamiliar gravity to a term that Luke has used, carelessly, for his entire life.\nResponding to something in the Mand\u2019alor\u2019s voice, Luke contemplates his answer for a few seconds. His instinct is to say no, but-- \u201cSort of,\u201d he finally says. \u201cIt\u2019s generally better if the form fits your temperament. Soresu, the third form, is kind of the embodiment of patience. That works for some Jedi more than others.\u201d The \u2018some\u2019 being Master Kenobi and the \u2018others\u2019 being basically every Jedi under the age of thirty. \u201cMy sister preferred Djem So, which is basically just hitting something until it falls over.\u201d\n\u201cAre the children of the Jedi tested for these forms?\u201d the Mand\u2019alor asks, with strange urgency.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Luke says, perplexed. \u201cNo? It\u2019s not--forms aren\u2019t personality assessments, they\u2019re just styles. Mandalorians don\u2019t all fight the same way, do they? You have--snipers, or hand-to-hand experts or--\u201d and here Luke flounders, because what would he term Boba Fett an expert in, other than being extremely irritating? Force, his shoulder really is killing him.\nThe Mand\u2019alor leans back, as though Luke has said something that has taken him off of his guard. \u201cI see,\u201d he murmurs. And then, with a little hissed fizz of static, he says, \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Luke bleats, like the dashing young Jedi Knight that he is, and then he looks down and realizes that he is, in fact, bleeding. Impossible to tell against the dark fabric of his shirt, but he\u2019d unbuttoned the collar to cool himself and there\u2019s blood smeared over his shoulder and along his collarbone. \u201cAw, hell,\u201d he mutters. This is why he always wears black.\n\u201cDid a Mandalorian do that?\u201d the Mand\u2019alor asks harshly.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Luke tells him, twisting around and trying to get a hand on the bacta patch that he\u2019s now realizing must have slid out of place. \u201cI was on a freighter that was blown up a few days ago.\u201d He catches the corner of the bacta patch and pulls it out of the collar of his shirt. Judging by the hot, slimy feeling he smears more blood up the side of his neck in the process.\u00a0\nAlmost as though he can tell that Luke is engaging in conduct unbecoming of a Jedi, Master Kenobi reaches out a very fine, polite tendril of awareness--is Luke available for breakfast? \u201cI should replace this. Anyway, it was, uh, nice to see you, sir. Mand\u2019alor.\u201d Luke crumples up the bacta patch in his gloved hand and gives a hurried bow as he leaves the little park. The Mand\u2019alor remains a still, steady presence at his back long after Luke returns to the palace.\n~\nThirty minutes into the morning\u2019s negotiations a very cold silence descends on the conference room, precipitated by Master Kenobi\u2019s benignly murmured,  Mand\u2019alor, if you would describe the circumstances leading up to your duel with Bo-Katan?  Both Bo-Katan and the Mand\u2019alor are radiating unsubtle menace into the Force. Master Kenobi is sipping from a cup of steaming Sauweceran tea that one of the protocol droids had fussily prepared for him.\u00a0\nAfter nearly a full minute, the Mand\u2019alor says, \u201cShe took the child.\u201d Luke can\u2019t help stiffening, instinctually. The Mand\u2019alor says  the  but his presence in the Force is a loud, resonant  my  --  she took my child .\u00a0\n\u201cAh,\u201d Master Kenobi says.\n\u201cIt was a misunderstanding,\u201d Bo-Katan replies through her teeth. Luke does not have to investigate her Force signature to comprehend her irritation; it\u2019s scrawled across her face. At least Korkie, seated to her left, has the grace to look a little ashamed. \u201cYou are a bounty hunter and a Child of the Watch.\u201d\n\u201cTo harm a child is the antithesis of the Way,\u201d says the Mandalorian seated on the Mand\u2019alor\u2019s left, the one with red armor and a ruff of fur. She has a posh, almost Core accent, and the precise, steady diction of a Jedi Master of many decades. Maybe she leads the Children of the Watch? None of the resources compiled by the Chief Librarian had been able to conclusively identify who was in charge. One of the books by the University of Sundari specialist had postulated that they didn\u2019t have a leader at all--that their teachings were individualistic, meant for self-guidance and self-discipline. The idea had intrigued Luke.\n\u201cHow was I to know that?\u201d Bo-Katan demands. \u201cYou people maintain your ways in secret, like rawls slithering around in the darkness.\u201d\n\u201cTo harm a child is to call yourself other, not of Mandalore,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor says, low and dangerous. \u201cI would remove my armor before hurting a foundling.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the Way,\u201d the posh Mandalorian says, somehow managing to sound nearly as sanctimonious as Master Yoda.\n\u201cThis is the Way,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor echoes. He leans back in his seat with the slow, coiling motion of a cautious predator. He turns his helmet a few degrees to make it apparent that he\u2019s shifted his attention to Master Kenobi. \u201cI didn\u2019t fight Bo-Katan out of desire for the saber. I just wanted the child back.\u201d\n My  child; impossible to miss that tangle in the Mand\u2019alor\u2019s Force signature, all fierce love and affectionate concern jumbled up with a parent\u2019s innate fear for their vulnerable child. Someone had tried to take Ben--just the once--when he was still too little to be given over to the cr\u00e8che. Leia had snatched Ben back into her arms and then crushed the would-be kidnapper, their speeder, and a passing Rayshoian restaurant delivery droid into a ball the size of her fist in about four seconds. So, really, fighting a planet\u2019s king and accidentally landing oneself possession of a sacred mark of leadership seems about on par with what Luke knows about how parents react to their children being in danger.\n\u201cIs your kid okay?\u201d Luke asks. He realizes this was a bad idea about three seconds too late to do anything about it; Bo-Katan is already swelling with offense.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor says. Luke has a flash of insight, no more than a sliver of projected memory, of a child\u2019s warm weight in his arms and its cheerful, burbling laugh.\nAcross the table, Bo-Katan shoots Luke a look that very clearly conveys that while she wouldn\u2019t hurt a child, she\u2019d have no issues throwing down with a twenty-eight-year-old Jedi Knight.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Luke mumbles. He can feel Master Kenobi\u2019s exasperated affection like a breath against the side of his face and it makes him flush. Knowing that he\u2019s a poor diplomat in the abstract is different from being reminded in situ, once again, that there\u2019s a reason why Luke spends most of his time escorting AgriCorps freighters around the galaxy.\n~\nThe New Mandalorian obsessed with Luke\u2019s father is offhandedly introduced over the course of the morning\u2019s \u201cnegotiations\u201d (yelling) as Korkie Kryze\u2019s husband, Adarmatan. He has the somewhat pampered look of an actual trophy husband--versus Luke\u2019s father, who isn\u2019t allowed to wear any color other than black because he can\u2019t be trusted to keep the grease off of his clothes--and the space between the two men feels cordial in the Force, as though they\u2019re business partners. Arranged marriages are fairly common in political dynasties throughout the galaxy but Luke is kind of surprised to have stumbled across one on Mandalore, whose people are famous for forging deep, intimate bonds.\u00a0\nThis anthropological curiosity does not make dealing with Adarmatan any easier, unfortunately. When they reconvene after a break for the midday meal, everyone settling back into their seats as annoyance swirls in the Force like colorful eddies, Adarmatan stops on his circumnavigation around the table to say, in almost an undertone, \u201cHeard you were demonstrating lightsaber forms in Ne\u2019tra Park this morning.\u201d\nLuke flicks him a dismissive glance and hums in the back of his throat.\n\u201cDid your dad teach you how to fight?\u201d Adarmatan persists.\nLuke says, \u201cNo.\u201d\nAlthough Bo-Katan had been very insistent that the Mand\u2019alor ought to sit at the head of the table--Luke couldn\u2019t help feeling, cynically, that this firm belief originated in Bo-Katan\u2019s sense of her own importance and her status as the proper Mand\u2019alor--Master Kenobi had gently countered that perhaps the two negotiating factions would feel more comfortable sitting across from each other. Bo-Katan had been overruled when the Mand\u2019alor had dropped pointedly into a seat along the side of the table. He\u2019d chosen the one next to Luke, much to the flared interest of Luke\u2019s central nervous system. Unfortunately, his presence now does not seem to be much of a deterrent.\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s right,\u201d Adarmatan says, as though he\u2019s only just recalled as such. \u201cHe left the Jedi, didn\u2019t he? What\u2019s the Hero With No Fear up to these days?\u201d Since yesterday, he has allowed his anger to win out over admiration and his pale little moustache quivers with it.\nLuke wants very, very badly to roll his eyes. The answer to this idiot\u2019s question is probably  helping rebuild his son-in-law\u2019s Corellian YT-1300 light freighter  , because Luke\u2019s father is easily bored and Han is always getting holes blasted in the side of his ship. Or it could be  playing at being a trophy husband  , because being married to the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Senate involves a not inconsiderable number of formal dinners and galas. Or, frankly, it could be  guest-lecturing ; Luke\u2019s father drops in occasionally to help with the senior padawans at the Temple, stuff like how to use the Force to accomplish basic mechanical work.\n\u201cVision quest,\u201d Luke says sarcastically.\nFor about half a second Adarmatan buys it, and then he seems to process Luke\u2019s tone and gets all huffy and irritated. Luckily, though, he also seems to understand that that\u2019s all he\u2019s going to get from Luke and off he goes to sit by his husband. His impotent fury seethes around him in the Force, meeting Bo-Katan\u2019s impatient annoyance and roiling into a dark cloud above Korkie\u2019s oblivious head.\nMaster Kenobi murmurs, \u201cMy apologies, Luke. I often forget--\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Luke interrupts quickly. He\u2019s very conscious of the Mand\u2019alor, sitting so close that Luke could probably touch his knee, if he was stupid enough to actually try to do so. Which: Luke is plenty dumb, but he\u2019s not that reckless. Anyway, the Mand\u2019alor is in quiet conversation with his posh advisor and hopefully missed Luke\u2019s rather obvious loss of temper. \u201cNot the first time that\u2019s happened.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Is that your usual response?\u201d Master Kenobi asks. Although his mouth quirks into a smile, his eyes are probing.\n\u201c\u2018Oh, I think he\u2019s on Coruscant,\u2019\u201d Luke parrots, adopting a deliberately light, guileless tone. \u201c\u2018The Senate is in session, so that\u2019s where my mother is, you know.\u2019\u201d His shoulders have been pulled up near his ears and he\u2019s reminded by a sharp twinge, deep inside muscle, that he ought not to be tensing his back at all. \u201cWhose idea was it to give you two those stupid names, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cOne does not control the holonet, Young Skywalker, but simply weathers its gales,\u201d Master Kenobi says, and then he raises his voice and effortlessly calls their next negotiating session to order. On Luke\u2019s other side, the Mand\u2019alor leans back in his chair and rests one hand on the table. He has the coiled tension of someone who is always prepared to act, even in repose.\nLuke feels a sudden, unexpected spike of interest: what is this man like with his child? Someone with whom he can be his true self, with whom he can share his name and face. Is there a man capable of tender care inside of that impenetrable beskar husk? But that\u2019s a disingenuous question, because the Force itself shows Luke the answer: the man is steady and deep and, in the moments he speaks of his child, almost radiant.\u00a0\n Ah  , Luke realizes, almost distantly.  So I might be in real trouble .\n~\nThe first full day of negotiations does not end with any probable solution on the horizon, as far as Luke can tell. Everyone gets the chance to speak their piece, which Luke intellectually understands as a crucial first step for negotiating a lasting accord-- lance a wound and you prevent festering, padawan --but he can\u2019t help feeling more and more tense as the day goes on and tensions ratchet higher. Master Kenobi seems pleased, though, so clearly Luke has missed something.\u00a0\nOne of the protocol droids shows Luke and Master Kenobi back to their suite and Master Kenobi spares about half a second to look around their bland rooms before suggesting, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you would be interested in a walk?\u201d and Luke is very eager to agree that that sounds like a great idea.\nThey end up somewhere far from the palace, wandering along a mid-height series of walkways. Various one- and two-passenger speeders zoom overhead, cutting through the fading artificial sunlight. \u201cIs it very different from before the war?\u201d Luke finds himself asking Master Kenobi.\u00a0\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d Master Kenobi counters softly. \u201cThe Mandalorian Civil War had already ravaged much of the planet before I first came here. They had some peace, I think, under the Duchess, but.\u201d He sighs. \u201cThe more years that pass, the more I recognize Darth Sidious\u2019 foul influence on events seemingly far removed from those of the Clone Wars. I\u2019m not sure we had ever had true peace during his lifetime.\u201d\nYikes. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty bleak, Master.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I actually feel quite optimistic regarding the future,\u201d Master Kenobi tells him. His face brightens with something--mischief? happiness?--and it peels some of the age off of his features. Master Kenobi might be old for a human Jedi but he\u2019s still quite handsome, with strands of red still lingering in his hair and those cheerful blue eyes. He\u2019s so charming even now that it\u2019s impossible to imagine what he must have been like in his prime. Devastating, probably. \u201cYour generation is so very bright, Luke. I can\u2019t help but worry sometimes that we old masters were irrevocably darkened by our time at war.\u201d\n Bright  is a familiar adjective to Luke. He\u2019d grown up in the cr\u00e8che hearing it over and over, whispered conferences when the cr\u00e8chemasters thought that he and Leia were asleep--  they\u2019re just so bright! Always said with a kind of dazed confusion. Presumably they\u2019d had just as little of an idea of what to do with Luke\u2019s father, the actual Chosen One, whose presence in the Force is a kind of impossible flame, but at least he\u2019d had a helpful moniker to give them some idea of what to expect from him. Luke and Leia had come with no such user\u2019s manual.\n\u201cAll experiences guide us deeper into the Force, don\u2019t they, Master?\u201d Luke points out. \u201cEven dark ones.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, I think I can hear Mace speaking to me from somewhere inside of that idea,\u201d Master Kenobi replies. Their walkway suddenly ends, spilling them out onto a balcony clinging like a mushroom to the side of an office building, but Master Kenobi unerringly guides them inside and then out, catty-corner, to another walkway. Leia had once told Luke that Master Kenobi\u2019s prescience often showed itself in strange ways and he\u2019s beginning to understand what she\u2019d meant. \u201cI hope you do actually find his words to be true, Luke.\u201d\nThat stings a little bit. \u201cI learned more from Master Windu than just how to parrot back his teachings,\u201d Luke says hotly. \u201cHe was a great master.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes, I\u2019m absolutely sure of it,\u201d Master Kenobi agrees, so mildly that it instantaneously extinguishes Luke\u2019s incipient temper. \u201cYou are a credit to the Order, Luke. And not just for your skills with a saber, although they are prodigious.\u201d\nLuke has been complimented on his saberwork for many years. It\u2019s long since ceased to have meaning for him. \u201cBeing a Jedi is more than just saberwork,\u201d Luke says. The weariness that this familiar line of thought pulls out of his chest is audible in his voice. \u201cI know that I\u2019m not--much of a diplomat, really. And peacekeeping enforced by a lightsaber is not really keeping peace at all, although I think it can be justice, sometimes.\u201d\n Compassion, justice, peace: these are what guide us in the Force, padawan  , Master Windu had told Luke more than once.  Harmony comes from the tension between these states. \nSundari seems to be undergoing a transformation, the way all cities do on the cusp of night, as the children go to sleep and their presence in the Living Force shifts into softly curious unconsciousness. The closest Luke has ever come to experiencing something similar is when the sun sets on Lake Paonga and the water changes from transparent to opaque in a matter of seconds.\u00a0\n Why don\u2019t we meditate, together, on how chaos is the enemy of justice? The memory of his master\u2019s deep voice daggers through his chest. Luke tries very hard to recognize the emotion that he is feeling so he might more efficiently release it into the Force, but it clings to his ribs and refuses to leave.\nThey walk in silence for a long time. Finally, as the last of the artificial sunlight fades and the glowglobes hovering above the walkways turn on, Master Kenobi offers, \u201cHe was very proud of you.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Luke croaks. He could always feel when Master Windu acknowledged his strong emotions and released them into the Force; during his last few years as a padawan, Luke had felt that surge of fierce pride more than once.\nLuke hadn\u2019t been able to really reconcile himself to the experience of losing Master Windu, not for months--not until four days ago, when those raiders greedy for a hydroponics energy cell had ripped open the hull of the AgriCorps freighter and Luke had spent an excruciating thirty-seven seconds in the vacuum of space, suddenly aware in a way he\u2019d never been before of just how small and isolated a single life form could be when separated from the Living Force.\n No one is ever really gone, Luke .\n\u201cI am sure Mace told you this many times, but there are so very many paths one might walk to bring balance to the Force. Most of them are unrecognizable as such until they\u2019ve already been embarked upon.\u201d Master Kenobi unfolds his left hand from the sleeve of his robe and strokes his beard thoughtfully. \u201cDo you want a padawan, Luke?\u201d\nLuke is so startled by this non sequitur that he missteps and almost plunges off the side of the walkway. \u201cUh!\u201d he says, intelligently. \u201cI mean?\u201d And then, once he\u2019s shaken off the worst of his confusion, \u201cI mean, yes, I would. But I thought--you know, that I was too dangerous?\u201d\nMaster Kenobi\u2019s face looks drawn under the cool blue light of a nearby glow-globe. \u201cIs this because of the Council\u2019s advice to you last year?\u201d\nLuke looks down at his feet, pretending that he somehow needs to watch where he\u2019s going. \u201cI meditated on the subject, as reprimanded,\u201d he mumbles to his feet. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t go anywhere productive. I really don\u2019t know why I keep ending up in these situations--I don\u2019t seek out Darksiders, really, I swear I don\u2019t.\u201d\nMaster Kenobi says, \u201cOh,  I  am well aware of that,\u201d and he sounds decidedly sardonic. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant as a reprimand, Luke, simply something of which it would behoove you to be aware. You most certainly are not too dangerous to train a padawan.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t--to keep me from falling, is it?\u201d Luke asks. \u201cLike Master Tano and my father?\u201d\nMaster Kenobi stops in the middle of the walkway. Luke only just manages to keep himself from crashing into him. \u201cLuke!\u201d he says, sounding honestly shocked. \u201cNo one thinks that you are in particular danger of falling to the Dark side.\u201d Deep sincerity radiates off of him as he turns and grasps Luke by the arm. \u201cIs this because of Maul? Luke, he would have killed you. I think I am perhaps the best authority on the subject, in fact.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I know,\u201d Luke backpedals, which is not quite true. There hadn\u2019t been room for rational thought, not after Maul had cut off his hand and Luke\u2019s animal hindbrain had recognized, in a sudden surge of horrified adrenaline, that if he didn\u2019t end their duel as quickly as possible he was probably going to die and then who would protect Leia? She hadn\u2019t carried a lightsaber in nearly a decade. \u201cBut it\u2019s just--\u201d\n\u201c--who else would have the miserable luck of stumbling across a Sith thought long extinct? On an otherwise routine diplomatic mission meant to be nowhere near Tatooine?\u201d Master Kenobi finishes drily.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Luke says, lamely.\n\u201cYour sister was my padawan, Luke, but I\u2019m afraid that you received the bulk of my legacy,\u201d Master Kenobi tells him. His eyes are very soft in the corners.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind your legacy, Master,\u201d Luke assures him. \u201cI just--\u201d He squeezes his eyes shut for a second. He feels completely adrift, like he had last year when he had been forced to recognize that the only way to get his sister and her staff out of Crimson Dawn\u2019s clutches was to duel a kriffing Sith with only one kriffing hand. \u201cI want to do good. The whole time, I try to do what I think is right, and then I\u2019m at the end and there\u2019s--there\u2019s bodies, that I didn\u2019t realize I would have to go through until I\u2019m already past them.\u201d\n\u201cDid you ever speak on this with Mace?\u201d Master Kenobi asks quietly.\nLuke laughs and then almost chokes on it. \u201cYes,\u201d he admits. \u201cHe said that anyone carrying a saber has to accept that it can be used on a sentient creature.\u201d  Feeling the weight of it isn\u2019t the problem; it\u2019s when it\u2019s too light or too heavy that you need to put it down, padawan. \nEven though Luke had tried to explain--how it felt to be the scissors cutting the thread connecting a sentient being\u2019s physical and spiritual selves--he had never been sure that his master really understood. It had taken Luke and Leia a long time to realize that the Force did not exist for them the way that it did for other members of their order. It simply was: irrevocable, endless, beautiful, loud. Like the ocean, but gravity. Like stone, but air. Luke hadn\u2019t realized that he could actually feel the Force signature of every person on Coruscant until the first time he\u2019d left the planet with Master Windu and been rendered completely disoriented by the jump to hyperspace. Not even their father understood, not really. He\u2019d only been a Jedi for a decade, in the middle of a life otherwise filled by strange, horrible, wonderful things.\nLuke had grown to be very lonely when Leia had left the Order. It had only gotten worse when Master Windu died.\nSome measure of Luke\u2019s misery must leak out of him, because Master Kenobi gently tugs him forward until he has wrapped Luke in a loose embrace. \u201cI think you would make a very fine master, Luke,\u201d Master Kenobi says. He smells faintly of red leaf. \u201cIf you will accept a bit of advice from an old man with a somewhat questionable track record--our padawans learn from our best and worst selves. It is impossible to hide the latter, I\u2019m afraid, so you will have to reconcile yourself to this inevitability.\u201d He releases Luke and moves back just far enough to nail Luke with a piercing stare. \u201cSpeaking of which, I think you had better let me take a look at that shoulder.\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s--\u201d Luke tries.\n\u201cIt most definitely is not,\u201d Master Kenobi interrupts, already turning on his heel, his robes flaring dramatically behind him. \u201cCome along, Luke.\u201d\nRather keenly aware of needing comforting, Luke follows.\n~\nLuke wakes with the sun and feels--not  better , necessarily, although his shoulder demonstrably is better, not quite so deeply painful, and Master Kenobi had been able to help with the burns enough that Luke likely won\u2019t have to swaddle himself in bacta patches this morning. Optimistic about his course of improvement, maybe.\nHe drags himself back to Ne\u2019tra Park and then through a few opening exercises for the sixth form, testing the range of motion of the newly healed skin of his shoulder. There is still an ache, deep inside the muscle, where the worst of the shrapnel had dug in, but it\u2019s much more manageable. Luke\u2019s cheerfulness at his improved physical condition wars with his mental disquiet and he doesn\u2019t manage to engage himself more than superficially with his sixth form exercises, which means that when the Mand\u2019alor\u2019s signature in the Force feels stronger, suddenly, in his proximity, Luke is easily distracted.\nThere is someone with the Mand\u2019alor; young, but very-- bright .\n\u201cOh,\u201d Luke breathes.\nThe Mand\u2019alor carries a child in his arms as he comes around the edge of the fountain in the center of the park. The child is making a soft cooing noise, his little three-fingered hand tugging at the bottom of the Mand\u2019alor\u2019s helmet. Luke reaches out to brush against his presence in the Force and the child makes a curious squeak of a noise and swivels around, his big eyes narrowing in on Luke.\n\u201cHello,\u201d Luke says. He can hear that he\u2019s gone soft.\n\u201cJedi,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor greets.\n\u201cI have a name,\u201d Luke tells him, aiming for waspish and falling somewhere much closer to fond. \u201cIt\u2019s Luke. What\u2019s your name?\u201d he asks the child.\n\n Grogu! \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Grogu,\u201d Luke says. \u201cYou\u2019re very--oh!\u201d The child outstretches his hand, kind of imperiously, and there\u2019s a sudden yank through the Force on the collar of Luke\u2019s shirt that sends him skidding forward along the grass. \u201cWow, okay, a little commandeering, are we? You remind me a lot of my nephew.\u201d He gently brushes off the beckoning touch and takes the chance to clip his lightsaber to his belt. \u201cCan I?\u201d he asks the Mand\u2019alor when he\u2019s close enough.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the Mand\u2019alor replies. Luke makes a scooping gesture with his hands and before he\u2019s finished, the child is clambering out of his father\u2019s grasp and throwing himself at Luke. \u201cOh,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor says, in a faintly perplexed fuzz of static.\n\u201cYou do, ah, know that he\u2019s Force-sensitive, right?\u201d Luke asks as Grogu settles into his arms and tries to stick one of his little hands up Luke\u2019s nose.\n\u201cThe sorcery may have given it away,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor replies.\nLuke hides his grin, ducking down to inspect Grogu\u2019s tiny little features. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen one of his kind so small,\u201d he marvels. \u201cNo wonder Masters Yoda and Yaddle don\u2019t tell anyone the location of their homeworld--they\u2019d be overrun by child-snatchers.\u201d Grogu gurgles curiously, his mind clumsily navigating around Luke\u2019s with great interest. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Grogu has met very many other Force-sensitives, he seems so confused by me.\u201d\nThe Mand\u2019alor says nothing. When Luke looks up at him, it\u2019s to find that impenetrable, reflective helmet pointed directly towards him. \u201cWhat?\u201d Luke asks. He can sense that the Mand\u2019alor is feeling a number of things, all of them quite strongly. His fondness is almost bittersweet.\n\u201cGrogu?\u201d the Mand\u2019alor says softly.\nLuke is very suddenly reminded that he is, on occasion, an idiot. \u201cJedi can share thoughts, sometimes. He showed me that his name is Grogu. He\u2019s actually really--\u201d Luke stumbles over the rest of his sentence when Grogu yanks at his nose again. \u201cOuch!\u201d Luke informs him performatively, sending a sensation of exaggerated discomfort along in the Force. Grogu\u2019s mouth twists in confusion and he babbles something that might be  ouch? \n\u201cHe almost feels trained,\u201d Luke marvels, looking back up at the Mand\u2019alor. \u201cDid you find someone to tutor him?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I--I found him.\u201d The Mand\u2019alor\u2019s voice is still so soft, Luke can feel it melting down the back of his throat. \u201cSomeone had put a bounty on him. A doctor, working for some big-shot karkface.\u201d The Mand\u2019alor\u2019s persistent air of lethality suddenly spikes from muted to aggressive. \u201cThey were doing things to him.\u201d\nThe afterimage of a Force signature slithers from Grogu\u2019s mind to Luke, more escaping than being willingly offered. Luke recognizes it, so acrid and harsh that it almost burns the inside of his nose, and he reflexively tightens his grip on Grogu\u2019s wriggling body. \u201cMaul,\u201d he says tightly.\n\u201cNot Maul,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor says. \u201cThe name was Gideon.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean--that\u2019s who trained him,\u201d Luke explains. \u201cMaul was a Sith apprentice, a long time ago, before his master was struck down. He spent thirty years murdering his way to the top of the Crimson Dawn syndicate and being a huge pain in the ass. I didn\u2019t know--I mean, I never thought--Sith aren\u2019t really known for their patience, you know? I don\u2019t know that it ever occurred to anyone that they would try to raise a youngling to be their apprentice.\u201d He feels incredible sorrow at the thought.  I\u2019m sorry , he tells Grogu. The child doesn\u2019t quite seem to know what to do with Luke\u2019s apology.\n\u201cWhat the hell is a Sith?\u201d the Mand\u2019alor demands.\n\u201cThey\u2019re the ancient enemy of the Jedi,\u201d Luke replies, by rote because he\u2019s distracted again by Grogu\u2019s huge, shining eyes. They\u2019re like tiny galaxies. \u201cThey seek out darkness and sow chaos. The would-be Emperor Palpatine was a Sith, that\u2019s why he engineered the Clone Wars.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone  engineered  the  Clone Wars ?\u201d the Mand\u2019alor repeats.\n\u201cYes?\u201d Luke says. \u201cThe Sith.\u201d\n\u201cDank farrik,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor mutters.\nGrogu, seemingly able to intuit that his father is in need of comfort, twists around in Luke\u2019s arms and gestures to his father with an inquiring little noise. The Mand\u2019alor responds automatically, stepping forward and reaching into the cradle of Luke\u2019s arms to embrace his son. He\u2019s so close, his helmet bent down solicitously, the rattling hum of his filtered breath suddenly so loud--Luke feels heat flare throughout his body, in his stomach, along the fronts of his thighs, up his back. For-- kriffing hell .\nThe Mand\u2019alor holds Grogu high enough in his arms that the child can place both palms against the lower half of his helmet. They seem to look into each other\u2019s eyes for a long moment, and then the Mand\u2019alor tilts his head and rests the top of his helmet against the child\u2019s forehead. It is such a bewilderingly intimate thing to witness that Luke coughs and steps back.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s, of course, when the blaster fire begins.\nLuke unclips his lightsaber from his belt and ignites it even as he whirls around, deflecting the second, third, and fourth blaster shots in quick succession. It gives him just enough breathing room to inhale, exhale, center himself in the Force and then reach out--\n\u201cFive-man team,\u201d he announces absently. \u201cCan you get Grogu somewhere safe?\u201d\n\u201cYou can take a five-man team?\u201d the Mand\u2019alor says. Luke would be insulted by his skepticism under other circumstances, but there\u2019s no time for that.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Luke replies shortly and then he takes a running leap up, bolstering his strength with the Force so his trajectory intercepts the one on the speeder. He has about half a second to clock that she\u2019s wearing Clone Wars-era clone armor, plastoid in lieu of beskar, no clan sigils on the vambraces or pauldrons, and then she\u2019s raining down quick blows--head, solar plexus, temple with the other elbow--and Luke counters inside of her guard, where Luke is more maneuverable because he\u2019s not in armor and he\u2019s smaller, more flexible. Her neck snaps under a punch with the hilt of his lightsaber and Luke has to scramble to grab and jerk the parking brake to stop the speeder from crashing into a rapidly approaching apartment building\u2019s transparisteel balcony. He takes advantage of the momentum to keep going, tumbling upright and sprinting along the railing of the balcony to the edge of the building. Then it\u2019s another Force-assisted jump up to the nest that two of the snipers had established on the roof of a nearby high-rise. He comes down on top of them and they\u2019re too surprised to react in time when he lands on the first one, leading with his knee. That one\u2019s out cold the second their head hits the duracrete floor--more antique clone armor, no sigil, Luke notes absently--but the other one has time to unsheath a vibrosword and he\u2019s not worried at all, which means cortosis. Kriff. There\u2019s serious money behind this, then.\nParry, overhead strike, parry, parry, inside cut, feint a roll--people always expect Jedi to use fancy acrobatics, Luke blames all of the shaky holocam footage of ridiculous Ataru duels from the Clone Wars--and then Luke kicks out his opponent\u2019s knee and beheads him with a upwards sweep of his lightsaber, no time for anything more complicated because it\u2019s a five-man team and this was only number three. He has to find the second sniper\u2019s nest.\nTime has slowed for Luke, now that his blood is up. He takes off for the edge of the high rise at a run and as he leaps off, prepared to hit the high-level walkway at sprint, he sacrifices a few precious seconds of attention to try and find the Mand\u2019alor. The park is deserted--oh, there, speeding away through the air--Luke hadn\u2019t noticed the jetpack. Maybe the Mand\u2019alor didn\u2019t wear it to the negotiating meetings? It would probably make sitting in a chair pretty uncomfortable--but Luke doesn\u2019t have any time to waste on that sort of useless speculation; he can see now that the other sniper\u2019s nest is clear because the two occupants also have kriffing jetpacks and are in pursuit of the Mand\u2019alor and his extremely loveable tiny child, because of course they do, why would this be  easy --\n~\nFour minutes later, Luke rides the second fake clone down into the courtyard of the palace in a plume of noxious black smoke, jerking his lightsaber out of the mess of the jetpack and thumbing it off as he rolls off and springs to his feet. \u201cThis one should still be alive,\u201d he announces to Master Kenobi, who is hurrying down the steps of the palace a few steps ahead of a swarm of Mandalorians in full armor. \u201cWhere\u2019s the Mand\u2019alor? Is Grogu okay?\u201d\nThe Mand\u2019alor is in the middle of the mass of people on the steps, Luke realizes. He\u2019s not moving. He seems to be staring at Luke.\n\u201cLuke,\u201d Master Kenobi says, very loudly. \u201cYour hand is sparking.\u201d\n\u201cAw, kriff,\u201d Luke says. He\u2019d parried one of those vibroblade strikes very low along the edge of his lightsaber, to improve his leverage, and it must have caught his cybernetic hand. He uses his teeth to tug off his glove and it\u2019s obvious once it\u2019s been removed that there\u2019s something very wrong. He tries to make a fist and smoke pours out of the wrist joint. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine,\u201d he tells Master Kenobi, who\u2019s made a concerned noise. \u201cI\u2019ll fix it later, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\nThe posh advisor is the first to reach the fake clone where Luke had left him as a groaning heap on the stone floor of the courtyard. She demands, \u201cState your purpose, coward,\u201d in the ringing tones of someone who expects to be answered.\n\u201cNo one said anything about a kriffing Jedi,\u201d the fake clone gurgles. \u201cTwo million kriffing credits, no one said anything about a  kriffing Jedi .\u201d He sounds, frankly, like Han when one of his slimy trading partners reneges on their part of a deal. \u201cI\u2019m not fighting a Jedi for two million measly credits.\u201d\n\u201cI think this explains why he surrendered so quickly,\u201d Luke observes to Master Kenobi. \u201cBut one of them had a vibrosword with a cortosis weave, so someone definitely knew to expect a Jedi.\u201d More loudly, Luke calls, \u201cI left one on a balcony across from Ne\u2019tra Park and two on top of a high-rise by there--one of those is still alive. The fifth also had a jetpack; he flew away before I could grab him, sorry.\u201d\nThe posh advisor nods at him. \u201cThey will be collected,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have our thanks, Jedi.\u201d\nLuke shrugs and clips his lightsaber to his belt. The nerve information coming from his right hand is beginning to feel strange and he frowns down at it, opening and closing his fist. He flares his fingers and gives the whole hand a sharp shake and that connects something--there\u2019s a dagger of sensation, jagged, up through his elbow and along the inside of his upper arm, and then it slowly dissolves.\nShaking his head does not quite get rid of the hot itch crawling from his cheek to his temple. That elbow on the speeder had gotten him good; he can feel that the skin above his right eye is split. There\u2019s definitely blood clotting in his eyelashes. \u201cAh, Uncle Obi-Wan?\u201d Luke says.\n\u201cYes, Luke?\u201d Master Kenobi answers. He\u2019s much closer than he\u2019d been a few seconds ago. Wasn\u2019t he just speaking with the Mand\u2019alor\u2019s posh advisor? But Luke can see now that the Mand\u2019alor himself is talking to his advisor, making a gesture with one hand like his fore- and middle fingers are running along a flat surface. Grogu is tucked in against his chest, only the tufts of his ears visible over his father\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cI think my shoulder isn\u2019t good again,\u201d Luke only just manages. He can feel that the adrenaline is finally draining out of him, leaving him cold and shivering.\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe you had better sit down,\u201d Master Kenobi tells him, just before Luke loses his battle with consciousness.\n~\nThere is someone sitting on Luke\u2019s chest when he wakes up. His eyes feel crusted shut and he has to blink a few times to clear away a disturbingly red film before he can focus. He\u2019s disoriented enough that he actually croaks, \u201cGrand Master?\u201d before he realizes that it\u2019s Grogu standing on his chest. The child has both of his hands pressed against Luke\u2019s face and his eyes are closed.\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor chides, appearing from nowhere to sweep Grogu off of Luke. \u201cWhat did I just tell you?\u201d\u00a0\nGrogu makes an insistent noise.\n\u201cLet him rest, you little womp rat,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor mutters, disappearing from Luke\u2019s immediate range of vision.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Luke manages, in a rough scrape.\nThe Mand\u2019alor reappears suddenly. \u201cLuke,\u201d he says, and there\u2019s a confused rush of static around him in the Force, like trying to tune into two holonet channels at once.\u00a0\n\u201cDid I faint?\u201d Luke asks him muzzily.\n\u201cYou had a bad knock to the head,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor corrects. After a strange pause, he says, \u201cThe Jedi said you were spaced a few days ago.\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019fine,\u201d Luke mumbles. \u201cBarely a minute.\u201d\nThe Mand\u2019alor doesn\u2019t say anything. Luke can\u2019t tell if he falls unconscious again; he feels really, really strange. But he blinks a few times and the Mand\u2019alor is still there, standing over Luke\u2019s prone body, holding Grogu as he attempts to wriggle free. The child has a very determined expression on his tiny face.\n\u201cI think--\u201d Luke tries, at the same time that the Mand\u2019alor says something, and Luke says, \u201cSorry, you go ahead.\u201d\nAnother one of those strange pauses. Maybe Luke is high? Mandalorians seem exactly like the kind of people who\u2019d use spice as a painkiller. Luke\u2019s vision is starting to go a little dark along the edges.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the Mand\u2019alor says, finally.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Mand\u2019alor,\u201d Luke replies sleepily. Maybe if he closes his eyes for a bit, the dark spots will clear up.\nThe Mand\u2019alor says, \u201cMy name is Din.\u201d\n~\nLuke wakes up with the sun. It sucks krakiss balls. His whole body feels like one enormous bruise.\nBased on the scent of bacta and antiseptic, he must be in some kind of medical facility. The room looks very similar to the rest of the palace--large, square windows, ornate molding--and, really, why wouldn\u2019t the Mandalorian Royal Palace have a Hall of Healing? Mandalorians fight each other all the time. Their sacred rite of kingship involves dueling, often to the death.\nThere is a tiny green body sacked out on top of Luke, starfished over his stomach so they are pressed belly to belly. There is a hand on the back of that tiny green body--thick, square fingers inside of a glove reinforced with beskar knuckle-guards--and Luke follows that hand up an arm to a shoulder with a familiar sigil on its pauldron. He should probably be confused about why the Mand\u2019alor is sitting at his bedside, but Luke is too distracted by a kind of breathless, exultant feeling in his chest.\n\n Din. \n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t leave,\u201d Din says. His voice is rough.\n\u201cI think he tried to Force heal me,\u201d Luke says. His cybernetic hand doesn\u2019t feel quite right, but he can control it enough to lift it and drop it carefully down on top of Grogu\u2019s head. His ears twitch under the pressure but he doesn\u2019t wake. Luke doesn\u2019t trust the pressure sensors not to suddenly short out, so he moves his hand away after only a few seconds.\n\u201cHe\u2019s done it before,\u201d Din says.\nLuke feels like his chest might rip open at any moment, all the better to tuck Grogu away inside of it. \u201cWhat an incredible kid,\u201d he marvels softly.\nHe\u2019s awake enough now to look around. The Mand\u2019alor is sitting in an armchair pulled up very close to Luke\u2019s cot, presumably to better keep a hand on his child. Master Kenobi, still asleep, is tucked in a matching armchair by the foot of the cot. There are the beginning signs of purple circles under his eyes. He looks very old, like this.\n\u201cHow did the negotiations go yesterday?\u201d Luke asks Din and he receives what he interprets as an incredulous stare in return, for all that it\u2019s delivered by expressionless beskar.\n\u201cNonexistent. We were all here,\u201d Din finally says.\nLuke can feel his face twist into an embarrassed frown. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he says.\nDin does not say anything so pointedly that Luke clears his throat and looks back down at Grogu. It\u2019s almost hypnotic, watching the child breathe. He does it with the complete abandon of the young. He must feel very safe with Din.\n\u201cTo be with one\u2019s own kind,\u201d Din says, suddenly. \u201cIt is the Way.\u201d\nLuke had read about this phrase in one of the books on his briefing datapad. The university professor had made it sound very similar to the Jedi Code, a set of guiding principles by which the Children of the Watch lived their strange, nomadic existence. It made sense that they had very strict rules about children; like the Jedi, they did not frequently reproduce amongst themselves but instead adopted their younglings. This made them incredibly conscious of their responsibilities towards their vulnerable charges.\n\u201cHe\u2019s your son,\u201d Luke says firmly.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Jedi,\u201d Din counters.\nLuke huffs out through his nose and immediately regrets this decision when sharp pain radiates along his brow ridge. \u201cHe\u2019s Force-sensitive,\u201d Luke says. \u201cThey\u2019re not the same thing.\u201d\n\u201cDo you not want him?\u201d Din asks, sounding almost offended.\n\u201cAre you kidding? You have the most adorable kid in ten parsecs,\u201d Luke tells him, and then he scrambles to add, \u201cOf course, Jedi don\u2019t covet people. Or possessions. Or people as if they\u2019re possessions.\u201d He can\u2019t help it; he lifts his cybernetic hand again so he can skim it over one of Grogu\u2019s soft, thin ears. \u201cBut if we did, I think he\u2019s very covetable.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Din agrees darkly.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Luke says, carefully moving his hand out of the way again. \u201cRight. The fake clones. Were they sent by that guy? Gideon?\u201d\n\u201cBounty\u2019s two million,\u201d Din says. \u201cThat\u2019s alive. It\u2019s only one if he\u2019s dead.\u201d Although he says this flatly, there\u2019s a flare of nearly incandescent fury around him in the Force.\n\u201cYou know who can do something about organized crime syndicates trying to kidnap their kid?\u201d Luke tells him. \u201cKings of planets.\u201d\nThe edges of Din\u2019s fury sputter and die and then he says, tiredly, \u201cI know nothing about being the king of these people.\u201d\nLuke may not be much of a diplomat and he can\u2019t really be trusted not to put his foot in his mouth if given enough leeway to do so but he can tell, somehow, that the most important part of that sentence is  these  people. He tries to hum in an acknowledging way in the back of his throat and manages instead a dry, sputtering cough. Grogu sleeps peacefully through all of the jostling, even when Din removes his hand and goes to find Luke some water.\nHe comes back with a carafe and a small cup. Luke has to use his flesh hand to take it and he\u2019s surprised by the stability of his grip. He hurts so much he\u2019d worried in the back of his mind that he\u2019d done something irreparable to his injured shoulder, but it seems to be working okay.\n\u201cAre they very different?\u201d Luke is eventually able to croak.\nDin moves his chair a little closer before he settles back into it, leaning back and extending his legs so his feet are under Luke\u2019s cot, crossed at the ankle. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t seem inclined to elaborate.\u00a0\nAfter a bit of careful thought, Luke slowly offers, \u201cIt\u2019s very disorienting, the first time you leave the Temple as a padawan. We\u2019re pretty sheltered as initiates--all that Force sensitivity, none of the control. It can be disastrous. But then when we\u2019re taken as padawans by a master, they basically throw us into the deep end. My sister and I were lucky in some ways, because our parents came to visit us when we were growing up. We heard stories, we knew a little bit more about how the galaxy really worked, but I was still--well. My first mission with my master was to coordinate this treaty renewal, on Melidaan. It\u2019d been thirty-five years since they signed the original one and it was just supposed to be ceremonial, but there had been rumors that one of the leaders was going to be assassinated so they asked for a Jedi presence.\u201d Luke\u2019s voice is getting rough again; Din leans forward and refills his cup from the carafe.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Luke murmurs. \u201cAnyway, I was just this kid from Coruscant. Worse than some rich Core World brat in a lot of ways, because the Order training emphasizes rationality, emotional intelligence, collaborative problem solving, all of that. Kids who can get upset and yank the roof out of a building need to learn to identify their emotions and resolve them pretty early in life. Ten years out from the Clone Wars, most Outer Rim planets weren\u2019t really in a place to be thinking about that kind of stuff, you know?\u201d Din snorts. \u201cYeah. Anyway, there I am, a ten-year-old raised on open-mindedness and conflict resolution, thinking I know all about the galaxy because I grew up hearing my dad\u2019s stories, and there\u2019s this planet that\u2019s thirty-five years out from a civil war so devastating they had to rename the planet afterwards.\u201d\nHe has to stop for a second, take a drink from his cup. Melidaan has been on his mind more than once in the last few months. That mission had been the first time he\u2019d really been able to see Master Windu in action and he\u2019d been astonishing. It had terrified Luke, the sudden realization that he would be expected to grow up into someone like this: poised, powerful, compassionate, firm. And tall, too, although Luke had never quite managed that.\n\u201cMelidaan has a biphasic population. Have you heard of it?\u201d Din shakes his helmet in brief negation. \u201cSomething like forty percent of the population is over seventy and fifty percent is under thirty. Their civil war was intergenerational; most of the young people died. They needed MediCorp aid for decades, because without gene therapy their kids would have gotten too many genetic disorders. I\u2019d never even been off  Coruscant .\u201d\nDin shakes his head and his helmet droops backwards, like exhaustion has suddenly sledgehammered him in the chest. He barks out a kind of hissed laugh and lifts a hand halfway to his helmet before he stops himself. \u201cRight,\u201d he sighs. \u201cSo you get it.\u201d\n\u201cIt can be pretty disorienting,\u201d Luke says. \u201cSuddenly there\u2019s this--abyss, of the stuff you didn\u2019t know. You didn\u2019t even know that you didn\u2019t know.\"\n\u201cWhen Bo-Katan grabbed the kid, she just--she took her helmet off. I\u2019d never seen another Mandalorian take their helmet off before,\u201d Din tells the ceiling. \u201cShe called me a Child of the Watch, she told me that I belonged to a cult. I didn\u2019t know. I thought we were all like this. Why would I know? These New Mandalorians, they keep to themselves here in their little city-domes. The only Mandalorians I ever met were from other coverts.\u201d\nGrogu stirs a little on Luke\u2019s chest, probably reacting to his father\u2019s distress in the Force. Luke releases his hold on his half-empty cup of water, trusting the Force to put it safely on the floor, and rests his flesh hand on Grogu\u2019s head.  Sleep, little one , he thinks, and Grogu stops fussing, his arms and legs going slack.\n\u201cThat\u2019s useful,\u201d Din mutters. When Luke flicks a glance at him, he\u2019s lifted his head, the front of his helmet is looking towards Luke. \u201cHe never wants to go to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s--entirely ethical,\u201d Luke says, a little embarrassed. \u201cBut he seems like he needs the rest. Force healing is incredibly draining.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna complain,\u201d Din says. His weariness is making his Force signature almost blurry at the edges. Luke should probably not be surprised at the extremely hot feeling that spikes through him at the thought of Din, sleepy and blurry, giving flesh underneath ungiving beskar, but he is. It takes him a not inconsiderable effort to wrestle this emotion into submission and offer it to the Force. Doing so leaves him feeling scraped out, like he\u2019s released his bone marrow along with it.\n\u201cYou should sleep,\u201d Luke tells him.\n\u201cDoubt there\u2019s time for that,\u201d Din says. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right. Got a couple of hours before I woke up and realized the kid had escaped.\u201d\nThere\u2019s silence, then, comfortable and warm and heavy. Luke watches Din watch his child. Two days ago, Luke had no idea that someone like Din existed in the galaxy. Luke\u2019s loneliness had felt both inescapable and preordained and he had finally begun the grueling work of resigning himself to it, fully. He hadn\u2019t thought--he hadn\u2019t even hoped, because to hope had felt like a betrayal of the Order--\nPleasure and sorrow hammer away at Luke with unfamiliar strength. There is little he can do but weather them.\n~\nMaster Kenobi returns to the Hall of Healing at midday, trailed by a protocol droid with two trays of food and that tea service droid he\u2019d somehow unearthed for the first day of negotiations. \u201cThe little one still sleeps?\u201d he asks quietly, looking down at Grogu with a fond twitch to the corner of his mouth.\n\u201cHe woke up to eat,\u201d Luke says. \u201cTo be honest, it raised a lot of uncomfortable questions for me about Grand Master Yoda. Do you think they\u2019re actually their planet\u2019s apex predator?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve suspected as such for a while,\u201d Master Kenobi tells him. His eyes are twinkling mischievously. \u201cDuring the Clone Wars, the Grand Master was deployed to the front for a number of months and the frog population in the Room of a Thousand Fountains apparently became quite untenable.\u201d He settles into Din\u2019s abandoned armchair and gestures to the protocol droid to bring forward their lunch trays. \u201cHow are you feeling, Luke?\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Luke says. \u201cAlso maybe like the Mand\u2019alor left his kid here because someone told him it\u2019d be a good way to keep me on this cot.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the Mand\u2019alor simply feels that you are well able to protect his child against further attacks,\u201d Master Kenobi says, mild and disingenuous. He fusses with Luke\u2019s tray, rearranging the dishes, before he allows the protocol droid to set it across Luke\u2019s lap. Grogu is tucked down by Luke\u2019s knees, where he\u2019d settled after he\u2019d eaten and the irritable ex-trooper medic who\u2019d examined Luke had declared him recovered enough to be allowed to sit upright. \u201cI am not surprised he received that impression after your actions yesterday.\u201d\nUgh. \u201cMaster,\u201d Luke tries.\n\u201cIt was very impressive,\u201d Master Kenobi continues mercilessly.\n\u201cI had to make sure I had the entire team neutralized as quickly as possible,\u201d Luke says, very quickly. \u201cIt was a calculated expenditure of effort.\u201d\n\u201cA massive expenditure, you mean,\u201d Master Kenobi returns flatly.\n\u201cI--may have not properly accounted for my lingering injuries after the incident with the AgriCorps freighter,\u201d Luke allows.\n\u201cYou ought to have been marched from the landing pad straight into a bacta tank after that assignment,\u201d Master Kenobi chides. \u201cThe only reason you weren\u2019t is because you didn\u2019t inform anyone and your mission report wasn\u2019t filed until after we\u2019d left for Mandalore. Luke, of all of the horrifically reckless things to do--Force\u2019s sake, these idiots were hardly a Darksider strike team! You could have taken more than a few seconds to fight them.\u201d\nLuke says, helplessly, watching a surge of something fierce rush to fill his own Force signature, \u201cI had to make sure they were safe.\u201d\nUnder any other circumstances, with any other master, Luke probably would have gotten away with it. Not Master Windu, of course, but his general style of mentorship had been spooling out enough rope for Luke to hang himself before offering vague advice that would allow Luke to figure out how to scramble his way to a solution. Big believer in independent problem-solving, Master Windu.\nMaster Kenobi\u2019s mentorship style is to stare at Luke with flat incredulity that slowly drains away into resignation. \u201cTwo days, Luke?\u201d he finally says.\nIt had taken Leia four minutes.  The Force just--calmed  , she\u2019d told Luke. There had been no way to release her emotions into the Force, because the Force hadn\u2019t been able to take them; its current had stilled, a kind of deep pool with Han at its center.  Is that why you immediately started shouting at him?  Luke had asked her. Instead of answering, Leia had punched him in the kidney.\nLuke shrugs jerkily.\nMaster Kenobi pinches off a sigh and squeezes the bridge of his nose. \u201cEat your qana beans, Luke,\u201d he says.\n~\nDin appears in the late evening, just in time to catch Luke being discharged. The head medic of the Mandalorian Royal Palace is a grizzled old trooper named Blisk. It\u2019s pretty clear he knows Kix, or has heard enough through the ex-trooper grapevine to be familiar with Kix\u2019s myriad complaints from his time serving with Luke\u2019s father, because the first thing he\u2019d said to Luke was a mild, \u201cIf you try to get out of that cot I\u2019m going to staple you to it.\u201d\n\u201cAm I cleared?\u201d Luke asks now as Blisk slaps what is hopefully a final bacta patch on his split eyebrow.\u00a0\n\u201cCleared for more idiotic stunts? Sure,\u201d Blisk drawls. \u201cYou get spaced again, though, and you\u2019re going right into a bacta tank.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best not to get spaced,\u201d Luke promises.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that before,\u201d Blisk mutters under his breath. And then, more loudly, \u201cYou got someone lined up for that hand yet?\u201d\nLuke spares a glance for his cybernetic hand. It\u2019s not smoking anymore but it\u2019s also stopped delivering nerve information, so the power cell\u2019s probably cooked. \u201cNah, I do my own repair work.\u201d This is not the first time Luke has broken his new hand in the last year. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019d given up on a synthflesh covering for it almost immediately.\nGrogu makes an inquiring noise and puts a little palm on the back of Luke\u2019s hand, as though he\u2019s offering to try to Force heal the cybernetics. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Luke tells him softly. \u201cWe do something else for that,\u201d and he shows Grogu a memory of replacing one of the motorized knuckles in his hand. Grogu gurgles and looks up at Luke with what seems to be real interest. \u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d Luke promises. \u201cI think I have the stuff I need in my kit.\u201d\n\u201cShow him what?\u201d Din asks. When Luke turns, Din\u2019s already halfway across the room. He nods once at Blisk, who nods back and then returns to his datapad, where he\u2019s hopefully amending Luke\u2019s medical records and finalizing his release.\n\u201cHe wants to help me fix my hand,\u201d Luke says. There\u2019s probably a dopey smile on his face as he watches Din scoop Grogu up into his arms.\n\u201cWhat, more Jedi stuff?\u201d Din says, with a spike of faint curiosity.\nLuke laughs. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cthe hand\u2019s just mechanic\u2019s work. Nothing mysterious about replacing a power cell.\u201d He tries to bend his wrist. A servo makes a sad noise but nothing else happens. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a year and this\u2019ll be my fourth power cell. Maybe I can source one a little more robust from Ubrikkian or something.\u201d He frowns down at his blackened cybernetic hand, and then at the sling into which Blisk had forced his left arm after a long discussion about deep tissue damage.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to wear the sling,\u201d Blisk says without looking up, \u201cand if you try to take it off I\u2019m going to--\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Luke says, \u201cyou\u2019ll staple it on, I got it.\u201d\n\u201cIs this kind of stupidity genetic?\u201d Blisk asks as he types away at his datapad. \u201cOr do they teach it at your fancy academy?\u201d\n\u201cWow, okay,  Kix ,\u201d Luke says.\n\u201cI\u2019m honored by the comparison,\u201d Blisk replies instantly, \u201csince the man\u2019s a legend for never losing his temper and murdering General Skywalker.\u201d\nLuke rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not disagreeing with you. Everybody knows my dad\u2019s a mess.\u201d\n\u201cAnd General Kenobi is worse,\u201d Blisk says darkly.\n\u201cAnd Master Kenobi is worse,\u201d Luke agrees readily. \u201cCan I go now?\u201d\nBlisk says, \u201cHe needs to wear the sling for at least two days or else his shoulder\u2019s not going to heal right, no matter what mystical bantha shit he tries.\u201d It takes Luke a second to realize that he\u2019s speaking to Din, who has tucked Grogu into the curve of his elbow and appears to be listening. \u201cAll the shrapnel should be out and the burns are basically healed, so there\u2019s no need to put more bacta on it. He just needs rest. No saber practice.\u201d\nLuke opens his mouth to complain but he\u2019s stymied by Din, who nods sharply, as though he\u2019s accepting responsibility for babysitting Luke--a grown man! A  Jedi Knight  !--during this absurd healing regimen. It suddenly occurs to Luke that maybe Din feels responsible, as though he\u2019s in Luke\u2019s debt because Luke had fought off those bounty hunters. He waits until they\u2019re in the corridor to say, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to--\u201d and he waggles his right elbow back towards the infirmary. \u201cI\u2019m not actually a helpless infant. The ex-troopers just get like that sometimes. There are a few of us whose parents served with them during the Clone Wars and I think the troopers kind of see us as--I don\u2019t know,  theirs , in some way.\u201d\n\u201cResponsibility for foundlings is shared by the entire covert,\u201d Din says.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Luke agrees, relieved that this is yet another instance where the experiences of the Children of the Watch and the Jedi Order neatly intersect, no elaboration necessary.\nLuke is gently testing the rotation of his left shoulder inside of the sling, trying to get a feel for what Grogu had done while he was unconscious, when Din says, \u201cAdarmatan Kryze said something today in the negotiations, about--Anakin Skywalker.\u201d He doesn\u2019t actually make it a question, but Luke can feel his curiosity as he says the name.\n\u201cMy father,\u201d Luke says, feeling his face go flat at the reminder of Adarmatan\u2019s strange venom. \u201cYeah, he keeps asking me about him. I can tell he\u2019s got a chip on his shoulder but about what, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n\u201cHe raised you?\u201d Din asks, with a weird inflection.\n\u201cFor a few years, but mostly I grew up in the Temple,\u201d Luke says. \u201cMy father left the Order right after the Clone Wars. He fell in love, which is fine, but he\u2019s not really--well. When you love too selfishly or deeply it can make you vulnerable to the Dark side of the Force. Fear, anger, all of that. Possessiveness is also really bad and my dad, uh. He feels very strongly about people he thinks are  his .\u201d\nDin does not say anything. It feels like there\u2019s a fist clenched around Luke\u2019s esophagus. Luke recognizes the source of that as a kind of frightened anticipation and tries to release it into the Force. It goes, eventually. Sort of.\n\u201cComing out of the Clone Wars, that included the troopers in his battalion,\u201d Luke continues around the lingering lump in his throat. \u201cHe was part of the body that negotiated that treaty, the one that allowed troopers who wanted to to become citizens of Mandalore. The New Mandalorians were pretty hesitant, I think. They\u2019re all pacifists, they apparently didn\u2019t want a lot of soldiers moving in--kriffing hell, I\u2019m an  idiot ,\u201d Luke realizes. Of course that\u2019s the source of Adarmatan\u2019s aggressive dislike. \u201cThat asshole, he\u2019s just mad that my dad forced them to recognize the troopers as Mandalorians. Well, he can kriff right off!\u201d\nDin\u2019s amusement feels like a sudden flare of warmth along the entire left side of Luke\u2019s body.\n\u201cI\u2019m a shit diplomat,\u201d Luke tells him, the truth of that settling in as exhaustion along his skeleton. \u201cI never can put this stuff together. My sister, Leia, she\u2019s so--she\u2019s just really good at it. She always knows what\u2019s going on underneath what people say or how they feel in the Force. I never--I don\u2019t know.\u201d Luke frowns and then makes a face at himself. \u201cSorry, never mind.\u201d With a start, he realizes that he recognizes the corridor they\u2019ve just turned into, with its quartet of doors painted various shades of pale green. The one that looks almost yellow leads to Luke and Master Kenobi\u2019s suite. \u201cThanks for walking me back.\u201d\nDin does not take this opportunity to leave. He just stands there, holding Grogu, looking at Luke.\n\u201cUh,\u201d Luke says, cleverly.\nAfter about fifteen extremely awkward and perplexing seconds of silence, Din says, \u201cThat hand needs fixing.\u201d\nLuke says, \u201cAre you--offering?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Din says.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Luke says, embarrassingly close to a squeak. \u201cWell, thank you. That, uh. That\u2019d be great.\u201d\nIf left to his own devices, Luke probably would have used the Force to do most of the fine mechanical work, undoubtedly tweaking his injured shoulder in the process and risking Blisk\u2019s wrath, but Din proves to have a steady hand. Luke narrates most of the steps for Grogu\u2019s benefit, telling Din what needs to be done and then explaining to Grogu why. The child probably only understands a little bit of what he\u2019s saying, but he looks so serious and interested that Luke can\u2019t help responding to that attention with thoroughness.\nHe gets distracted, once or twice, watching Din\u2019s hands in their bulky gloves carefully cradle one of Luke\u2019s extremely tiny screwdrivers as he removes the plate protecting the power cell. It\u2019s so intimate that it should feel uncomfortable, shouldn\u2019t it? The only people other than Luke who have ever seen inside of his hand are his dad and the DD-13 that had installed the hand in the first place. But it feels so good to be the recipient of Din\u2019s careful focus.\nDin unfastens the power cell and lifts it out, turning it so that Grogu, sitting on Luke\u2019s lap, can get a good look at it. \u201cFried,\u201d he tells Grogu, showing him where the safety coating has eroded.\n\u201cBlebleble,\u201d Grogu agrees.\nDin unwraps the new power cell from its polyfilm packaging. Luke always packs extra parts for his hand in his kit and he is, unfortunately, usually rewarded for his foresight. \u201cNot fried,\u201d Din says, pointing to the smooth surface of the new power cell\u2019s safety coating. Grogu taps it with a claw and makes a pleased noise at the texture.\n\u201cThis is already going better than his last attempt at electrical work,\u201d Din says. He looks down into Luke\u2019s splayed-open hand and his whole body seems to frown. \u201cOkay if I clean this?\u201d he says.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Luke says. \u201cBut you don\u2019t need to.\u201d\nDin says nothing, pointedly. He fishes a nylar swab-tipped stick out of Luke\u2019s repair kit and then scrounges around further, clearly looking for something. \u201cYou got any cleaning solution?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cI usually use saliva,\u201d Luke tells him. \u201cHere, let me,\u201d and he makes an aborted movement with his left hand, tucked against his chest by the sling, before he remembers to stop himself.\nDin looks at the kit, and then the swab, and then at Luke. His body sort of twitches and then he extends the swab towards Luke, carefully, like he\u2019s not entirely sure of what he\u2019s doing. Luke leans forward and takes the swab into his mouth, closing his lips around the stick and gently rolling the swab across his tongue. It takes him a few seconds to generate enough saliva; his mouth feels very dry.\nAround them, the Force slows to a sluggish roil. There\u2019s something coming off of Din, viscous and dense, seeping out from behind the beskar. Luke has attracted other sentient beings before and it\u2019s always felt like being hit in the face with a cloud of expensive cologne--sharp, overwhelming, heady. Whatever Din is feeling is thick. There\u2019s a steadiness to it that is confusing but also deeply pleasurable.\nLuke feels his thoughts actively liquify as Din carefully uses the swab to clean the worst of the soot off of the power cell chamber. When he discards the first swab and picks up a second, Luke barely has a second to press his tongue against the roof of his mouth, preparing himself, before Din turns away and there\u2019s a tilting motion--oh, Luke realizes, slowly, all of his blood thickened to jogan syrup, because Din has  lifted the bottom of his helmet --and when he turns back the tip of the swab glistens faintly.\nLuke wants, so abruptly that it\u2019s physically disorienting, to see Din\u2019s face. He wants to know the shape of his mouth. He wants--\n Their doctrine requires their face go unobserved by any other living creature . Luke winces and straightens up, trying to shake off the worst of the disorientation. Luke is a Jedi Knight. This is so massively unbecoming that Master Windu, one with the Force, is probably shaking his head in disappointment right now. Not only is Luke a disgrace to the tenets of the Jedi Code, he\u2019s being actively disrespectful of Din\u2019s Creed.\nAlso, there\u2019s a kriffing baby on his lap.\nDin finishes replacing the power cell and watches mutely as Luke tests for any further injuries requiring repair. One of the servos needs a new washer--Din leaves Luke to explain this process to Grogu, which Luke does with a croak to his voice that he hopes isn\u2019t too embarrassingly obvious--and then it\u2019s as good as a functional cybernetic ever gets after an encounter with a cortosis-enhanced vibrosword. Din collects Grogu from Luke\u2019s lap, pulls the fried power cell out from where it\u2019s been clenched between the child\u2019s little teeth, and then says, quiet and rough, \u201cGood night, Luke,\u201d as he\u2019s halfway out the door.\nLuke tries to meditate after they\u2019ve left. It does not go well.\n~\nMaster Kenobi seems cheerful and restful when he joins Luke in the sitting room of their suite the next morning. There\u2019s something almost smug along the edges of his presence in the Force, familiar to Luke because he\u2019d seen it once or twice when Master Kenobi had a pop quiz planned for the students in one of his courses. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asks.\u00a0\nLuke shrugs and is pleasantly surprised when he doesn\u2019t have to immediately shunt any physical discomfort into the Force. \u201cGood, actually,\u201d he says. \u201cThe sling\u2019s annoying but my cybernetic hand is working again so it\u2019s manageable.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, I did notice,\u201d Master Kenobi says, flicking a pointed glance at where Luke is lifting his cup of caf to his mouth. \u201cDid Blisk assist you?\u201d\n\u201cOh, uh.\u201d Luke coughs. \u201cThe, uh. Mand\u2019alor. Was able to help. With that.\u201d\nMaster Kenobi seems sort of flatly unsurprised. Perhaps--oh  no --he\u2019d been able to sense a faint trace of that thick, rich feeling in the Force when he\u2019d returned to their suite last night.\n\u201cAnd Grogu!\u201d Luke adds, a little desperately. \u201cGrogu, who was also here. With us.\u201d Even if Master Kenobi thinks so poorly of Luke--which he must, because Luke is pretty obviously failing to adhere to the Jedi Code more and more with every passing second he spends on Mandalore--surely he knows that Luke would draw a line about doing anything with a baby around.\n\u201cThe child,\u201d Master Kenobi says, apparently willing to be distracted. \u201cHe is astonishing, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s more amazing, that he\u2019s so little and has so much control already, or that he apparently learned it from  Darth Maul .\u201d Luke shakes his head and drains his cup of caf, turning his attention to the bowl of stewed oranges on his breakfast tray. \u201cI sense very little darkness in him.\u201d\n\u201cNo, me neither,\u201d Master Kenobi agrees. Someone involved in catering has apparently wised up to his eating habits; his pot of tea is accompanied only by a small plate with two blue milk biscuits on it. \u201cThey are likely related. I suspect that Grogu is significantly older than his size suggests and he accordingly was with Maul for a relatively short period of his life. I\u2019ve sent a message to the Council but they have yet to reply.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised Master Yoda isn\u2019t frothing at the mouth to recover him,\u201d Luke admits, squishing a segment of stewed orange into submission with the side of his spoon. Don\u2019t Mandalorians ever get tired of this gruel? Luke\u2019s eaten it for every meal since they landed on the planet and he feels like his fingernails are on the verge of turning orange.\n\u201cYou know that it\u2019s difficult, with older children,\u201d Master Kenobi says. \u201cGrogu could very well be twenty or even thirty years old. He\u2019s formed a very strong connection with the Mand\u2019alor. You can sense it, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Luke says, confused. \u201cBut most Force-sensitive children form bonds quickly, I thought that was normal.\u201d\n\u201cWith the cr\u00e8chemasters, certainly,\u201d Master Kenobi says. \u201cBut with an individual so insensitive to the Force? It\u2019s much more rare. If I may quote the Grand Master,  reeks of attachment, this does . It could be dangerous to separate them.\u201d\nLuke frowns down at his mushed oranges. He\u2019s heard stories, of course, from fellow knights who\u2019ve stumbled across Force-sensitive children during other assignments. They\u2019re almost uniformly tragic. Rarely, they have happy endings--Luke had grown up with age-mates in the cr\u00e8che whose parents had moved to Coruscant to stay in orbit around their Jedi children, packing up their whole lives and becoming support staff at the Temple or finding jobs in nearby neighborhoods just so they could visit the cr\u00e8che a few times a year.\nSometimes the children are in more precarious situations, unable or unwilling to leave parents unable or unwilling to themselves move. It usually isn\u2019t a problem; untrained Force-sensitivity fades with time with nothing to hone itself against. But Grogu is rather demonstrably trained and leaving him like this would only make him a danger to himself and others. \u201cWhat did you recommend?\u201d Luke asks.\n\u201cI think a tutor might give us the best outcome,\u201d Master Kenobi says. \u201cThe situation is rather unique, you must admit. I suspect that Grogu will not be of an equivalent age to a senior initiate until after the Mand\u2019alor\u2019s natural lifespan has ended. After his death, perhaps the idea of joining the Temple might be revisited. It\u2019s an unorthodox solution but one I believe the Order might accept.\u201d\n\u201cWait, seriously?\u201d Luke stares at him.\n\u201cGrand Master Yoda once mentioned to me that he was not knighted until well into his first century,\u201d Master Kenobi says. \u201cI believe he meant to soothe my anxieties regarding my own delayed Trials, but as you might imagine it only made them worse.\u201d\n\u201cA  century !\u201d Luke marvels.\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s over nine hundred years old, Luke,\u201d Master Kenobi says.\n\u201cI\u2019m really glad it didn\u2019t take me a hundred years to be knighted,\u201d Luke says.\nMaster Kenobi crunches through one of his blue milk biscuits. \u201cThere were very few doubts about whether or not you would achieve knighthood, Luke. I hope you were not particularly anxious about that outcome.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t everyone?\u201d Luke points out. \u201cAll that bantha shit about the Chosen One, pft. Having a weird relationship with the Force doesn\u2019t make you a Jedi Knight, it just makes you a Skywalker. And some of the masters seemed upset when I chose to specialize in Niman.\u201d\nMaster Kenobi rolls his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t let yourself be swayed by the grumbles of old masters, Luke. Common salle wisdom disdains Niman as the dilettante\u2019s form but that\u2019s a shallow interpretation and you know it. You\u2019ve brought a rare artistry to the sixth form and  some  people ought to be grateful for it, rather than bitter over losing out on a few credits.\u201d\nLuke makes a confused noise.\n\u201cOh, there were a few wagers on the subject of your and Leia\u2019s eventual forms,\u201d Master Kenobi says dismissively. \u201cMace and I were forbidden from participating but we were aware of it. Your sister is too short for Djem So but everyone knew that would hardly stop her, so that bet was not very interesting. Your preference was much more hotly contested.\u201d\nLuke can feel his mouth twist into an awkward, embarrassed grimace. \u201cI\u2019m really glad I had no idea at the time,\u201d he admits.\n\u201cMace shielded you from it, as I did for Leia.\u201d Master Kenobi swirls his tea with a casual, thoughtless turn of his wrist, his mind clearly darting to some new subject. \u201cYou\u2019re aware, of course, that the sixth form is meant to allow its adherents flexibility and creativity because it pulls from the first five forms. The general praxis is to learn the basics of the first, second, and third forms, undertake a few years of study of the sixth, and then pick up more advanced techniques as needed--a kind of scavenging of sorts. I don\u2019t believe Mace taught it to you that way?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Luke says. \u201cI learned the first five forms in full, and then Vaapad, and then the sixth form. I was already a senior padawan by the time he taught me Niman. I knew at the time it was a little unusual, but Master Windu said I needed the emotional stability provided by the other forms. I thought it was, you know, an accommodation.\u201d\n\u201cFor being a Skywalker?\u201d Master Kenobi smirks at him. \u201cA reasonable assumption, and one I think Mace would have clarified if he\u2019d had the time. No, Luke, it was most certainly not because the Skywalkers are a family prone to emotional instability.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we are,\u201d Luke points out.\nMaster Kenobi hums in the back of his throat. \u201cYour father struggled with anger and fear, yes. But he was brainwashed for a decade by a Sith lord powerful enough to live on the same planet as the Jedi Order without being detected, so I\u2019m willing to give him some leeway on that point.\u201d\nLuke says, \u201cOkay, but Leia left the Order, too.\u201d\n\u201cIn deference to her emotions?\u201d Master Kenobi asks, the same way he\u2019d used to lead recalcitrant padawans in his Mid Rim Poetry of the Ruusan Reformation seminar--Leia had forced Luke to enroll so she wouldn\u2019t have to take it alone--to a logical conclusion just out of reach. It\u2019s condescending and horrible and Luke has been trained by literal decades\u2019 worth of experience to respond to it with a reflective pause.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he finally admits. \u201cShe fundamentally disagreed with the tenets of the Order. She felt that we should interfere more, not less.\u201d\n\u201cYour sister\u2019s decision not to undertake her Trials was almost entirely the result of rational philosophy,\u201d Master Kenobi says. \u201cReally, Leia is one of our Order\u2019s great successes. She is unbelievably powerful and could be incredibly destructive, but she understands and controls her emotions. She respects logic and the will of the Force. She uses the skills she learned from the Order to serve her people. And I think, perhaps most crucially, she understands that the Jedi Order ought not to be involved in political matters--but political matters could be well-served by being undertaken by someone with the humility and integrity of a Jedi.\u201d\nThis is an interesting interpretation of the character of Luke\u2019s sister, who spends most of her time embroiled in sprawling, screaming arguments with both her husband and father and usually gets her way by sheer bulldozing. It does in many ways reflect Senator Skywalker, though--a woman who is frequently in holonet headlines advocating for a coherent galactic refugee charter or reducing Republican financial support for corporations that don\u2019t subsidize medical droid access for their employees. It has never occurred to Luke that what Leia took away from the Jedi Order was a kind of professional armor she\u2019s now able to don when she steps away from her personal life.\nLuke doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s been totally distracted until he looks up from his now-empty bowl of stewed oranges and Master Kenobi is draining his second and final cup of tea. \u201cYou were trying to say something,\u201d Luke prompts him. \u201cAbout Niman?\u201d\nMaster Kenobi says, a little startled, \u201cHmm? Oh, yes. I was.\u201d His gaze sharpens on Luke, suddenly, like there are twin kyber crystals behind his eyes. \u201cMace didn\u2019t train you in the sixth form in the traditional sense, Luke. He taught you the other forms and then allowed you to develop your own deep, personal interpretation of Niman. I think you will find it worthwhile to contemplate the difference.\u201d\u00a0\nLuke has no idea what to say. Eventually, he settles on, \u201cThank you, Master. I will.\u201d\nMaster Kenobi puts down his cup and rises to his feet, his sharp stare tamping down into a mischievous twinkle. His Force signature has begun to sing; he\u2019s excited about something. \u201cShall we proceed to the conference room? I think today\u2019s negotiations will prove quite satisfying.\u201d\u00a0\nContemplations on lightsaber forms will have to wait; Luke has known Master Kenobi his entire life, so he has enough experience to know that that\u2019s a terrifying sentiment.\n~\nThere are two new but very familiar faces waiting for them in the conference room when Master Kenobi and Luke arrive exactly on the hour. \u201cI invited guests from Keldabe to join us today,\u201d Master Kenobi announces, sweeping towards his seat with his cloak billowing behind him. \u201cGovernor, Minister, I believe you both know Bo-Katan, Korkie, and Adarmatan Kryze?\u201d\nAdarmatan is too busy glaring poisonously at Luke but Korkie and Bo-Katan offer vaguely polite greetings.\n\u201cMand\u2019alor, if I may introduce Governor Cody and Minister Numa?\u201d Master Kenobi continues. There\u2019s a long pause as everyone sizes up each other\u2019s deadliness, the Force becoming ponderous, almost burnt-smelling, and then the feeling abruptly dissipates as everyone seems to accept that this is a room full of dangerous people, Adarmatan and Korkie Kryze presumably excepted. Kriffing Mandalorians. Din nods in acknowledgement of the introduction. \u201cThe governor serves as the head of the government of Keldabe, where most of the former clone troopers have settled, and Numa is their Minister of Planetary Affairs. And you know Luke, of course, governor.\u201d\nCody looks at Luke\u2019s arm in its sling and raises an eyebrow. \u201cHeard you tried out flying a bounty hunter,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it recreationally,\u201d Luke says. It\u2019s probably too much to hope that his parents haven\u2019t heard about this yet; the ex-trooper grapevine is kind of terrifyingly efficient at disseminating information and Luke\u2019s father is still mostly tapped in. \u201cNice to see you again, Cody. You too, Numa.\u201d\nNuma says, \u201cHey, Luke. Glad you aren\u2019t dead or whatever.\u201d She\u2019s carrying about fourteen datapads that she unceremoniously drops onto the conference table. When Adarmatan sneers in her general sort of direction, Numa looks down her nose at him and sneers right back.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Luke says.\n\u201cKeldabe is currently the second-largest city on Mandalore and its citizens make up nearly half of the population,\u201d Master Kenobi remarks as he settles into his chair. \u201cI thought it appropriate for their head of government to participate in our discussion.\u201d\n\u201cThe Mand\u2019alor is the head of their government,\u201d Bo-Katan says.\n\u201cDo you object to the inclusion, Mand\u2019alor?\u201d Master Kenobi asks politely.\nDin says, \u201cNo,\u201d and folds his arms across his chest. Is his chair a little bit closer to Luke\u2019s than it had been two days ago? The angle makes it hard to tell; Din is turned so that Luke can mostly see him in profile, his chair oriented so that he has both the Keldabians and the New Mandalorians in the same line of sight.\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious within a few minutes that something substantial had happened yesterday while Luke was laid up suffering Blisk\u2019s tender mercies. The conversation no longer seems to be revolving around whether or not Din is going to just take off in the middle of the night and leave the Darksaber to whichever Kryze grabs it first--\u201dIt must be won in  honorable combat ,\u201d Bo-Katan had hissed through her teeth when Din had made to unclip the Darksaber from his belt and chuck it across the table at her that first day--but instead a discussion about something that sounds like government structural reform.\nIt takes Luke a little while to catch onto the actual thread of the conversation, because he\u2019s busy trying to get a sense of everyone in the Force. He demonstrably is not good at interpreting that information--case in point: Adarmatan--but it might be useful for Master Kenobi to know and Luke is anyway just sitting there. The various Kryzes are annoyed but much less impotently than previous days; their seething seems more focused. Cody and Numa are alert, attentive, and optimistic, which makes Luke think that they had been the dinner appointment that had kept Master Kenobi out until very late last night. The posh advisor is very, very good at keeping her emotions tucked away behind her beskar armor and all Luke can get out of her is a sort of wry amusement.\nDin feels prickly and turbulent, like a cornered back-alley tooka-cat.\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t there anyone from Keldabe on the Ruling Council?\u201d he asks late into the morning. The sound of his voice rings like a bell in the Force for a long moment; Luke can feel that something has been set in motion, the reverberations so forceful that his molars rattle in the back of his skull.\n\u201cGreat question,\u201d Numa says. \u201cWhy  isn\u2019t  there anyone from the second most populous city on the planet on the Ruling Council, Kryze?\u201d\nKorkie frowns. \u201cYou refused the position.\u201d\nNuma says, \u201cA non-voting seat isn\u2019t a position, it\u2019s a publicity stunt.\u201d\n\u201cNo other cities were offered a place on the Ruling Council,\u201d Adarmatan says. \u201cIt was an offer made only to the clones of Keldabe, and you refused.\u201d\n\u201cBecause it was  non-voting ,\u201d Numa says, enunciating slowly around her fangs. \u201cAnd there aren\u2019t any other cities on Mandalore, not really--eighty percent of the population lives in Sundari or Keldabe. That said, the governor of Concordia has a voting seat.\u201d\n\u201cOur only arable farmland is on Concordia,\u201d Korkie says.\n\u201cAnd half of our population lives in Keldabe,\u201d Numa snaps. \u201cBesides, you didn\u2019t give the governor of Concordia a voting seat because you\u2019re worried about farmland. Everyone at this table knows that the vast majority of our food is imported. You gave it because you didn\u2019t want a second Death Watch fomenting up there.\u201d\nBo-Katan hisses, \u201cDo not dare.\u201d\n\u201cNo one cares about your past exploits, Bo-Katan,\u201d Cody says shortly. \u201cDon\u2019t look for insults where there aren\u2019t any.\u201d\nLuke can feel that Din is a little adrift in this back-and-forth. Does he know enough about Mandalore\u2019s history to even be following this conversation? But inside of that thin cloud of confusion, Luke can feel a determined tendril of something that he thinks is fundamental to Din: a sense of keen, deeply-rooted responsibility. It was always there, but it seems to be growing stronger, like new growth soaking up the spring sunlight.\n\u201cDoes Keldabe need aid?\u201d Din asks. The roiling confusion around him sharpens, suddenly, and Luke inhales and doesn\u2019t exhale, waiting on the drop he can feel setting its hook behind his stomach.\nCody says, \u201cNot in the immediate sense. But there\u2019s too many of us in that little dome. We need to expand, or we need to get serious AgriCorps help to recover land. We\u2019re on an island; it might be more feasible there than here on the main continent. Beyond even that, though: We are Mandalorians, not inconvenient pests. We\u2019re owed a voice on the Ruling Council.\u201d\nSomething in the Force shifts. Luke\u2019s ears pop.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Din says, steady now. That bright tendril-- kinship, honor, responsibility --feels like it has blazed into a great tree. \u201cYou are.\u201d\nThe posh advisor says, \u201cA Mandalorian will always come to the aid of another. This is the Way.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the Way,\u201d Din agrees.\nAdarmatan\u2019s little moustache is shivering furiously above his mouth, like at any moment his indignation is going to make it dance right off of his face. \u201cMy father died defending the New Mandalorian way of life,\u201d he says tightly. \u201cHe was far from the only one, but he did so gladly because it was righteous. And when we finally had peace--when the galaxy had peace, when people were finally prepared to listen to us--in flooded these--engineered creatures of war, shoved down our throats by the Jedi.\u201d He bares his teeth. \u201cThey are not Mandalorians. They are clones.\u201d\nNuma drawls, \u201cTechnically, I\u2019m a Twi\u2019lek.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re Mandalorian and you know it,\u201d Cody says.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not Mandalorian because you\u2019re a clone, I\u2019m even worse--I\u2019m a Twi\u2019lek who was adopted by clones,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the logical continuation of his point. Were you born of some fine lineage, Mand\u2019alor?\u201d\n\u201cI was a foundling,\u201d Din says, with a low, audibly dangerous edge.\n\u201cI\u2019m not questioning the Mand\u2019alor,\u201d Adarmatan says to Numa, almost spitting now with the venom he\u2019s clearly been nurturing for some time. \u201cIt\u2019s you I question. The Republic forced us to accept your kind, but we aren\u2019t members of the Republic and we aren\u2019t beholden to their laws.\u201d\nNuma looks about half a second from slinging one of her datapads into his face.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Republic law that recognized the clone troopers as Mandalorians,\u201d Luke says. Din\u2019s head whips around to look at him and Adarmatan follows suit, narrow-eyed and furious at the interruption. \u201cThey fulfilled the Resol\u2019nare. The treaty simply acknowledged it.\u201d\n\u201cThe six actions are archaic nonsense,\u201d Adarmatan says.\n\u201cBut still legal,\u201d Numa replies swiftly. \u201cVery, very legal.\u201d\nNext to Luke, Master Kenobi is radiating a truly unbelievable amount of smug satisfaction into the Force. No doubt he\u2019d planned this entire negotiation process to get this exact outcome. And it\u2019s obvious why he would have felt the need to do so--the air feels clearer even with Adarmatan\u2019s furious words still floating around their heads. How many wounds need lancing before the Mandalorians can work towards an integrated and successful society, for kriff\u2019s sake?\u00a0\nLuke leans back in his chair and then can\u2019t quite swallow back a wince; he\u2019s stiff from sitting and he\u2019s getting a headache from all of the tension and roiling emotions around him. Attempts to release his physical discomfort into the Force are met with abject failure.  This is yours  , the Force seems to be saying, sounding eerily like Master Windu.  Suffer and learn something. \u00a0\nDin is still looking at Luke. He says, \u201cWe break now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Adarmatan squawks. \u201cYou can\u2019t just-- end  a session!\u201d\n\u201cYes, I can,\u201d Din says flatly. \u201cI\u2019m the Mand\u2019alor.\u201d\n~\nSomehow, in the confusion of everyone breaking for lunch, Luke ends up in Din\u2019s hands. He\u2019s not quite sure how it happens; one minute, he\u2019s talking to Cody, assuring him that he\u2019s sore but otherwise okay, no need for anyone\u2019s parents to be notified, and then the next Din\u2019s hand is cupping his right shoulder, steering him without actually pressing against any injuries--isn\u2019t  that  a distractingly gentle gesture--and Luke and Din are in a corridor by themselves and Luke can feel the nearby presence of Grogu, curious and happy and voraciously hungry.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Luke manages as Din guides him through a doorway into a very, very nice suite of rooms. Luke is immediately distracted by Grogu stumbling to his feet and staggering towards Luke and Din with great enthusiasm and very little skill. He leaves on the floor behind him a Mandalorian whom Luke assumes is another member of Din\u2019s covert because they\u2019re wearing full armor, helmet included, folded up like a beskar pretzel along with a pile of blocks and an enormous stuffed mythosaur. \u201cHey, little guy,\u201d Luke says. He only makes a twitch towards the child before Din has a hand back on his right shoulder, reeling him out of range of any overenthusiastic reunions.\n\u201cSit,\u201d Din says.\nThere\u2019s a lot of places to choose from; how many chaises can one room reasonably hold? The answer seems to be seven or eight. Luke sinks down onto the nearest one, which immediately envelops his body in its plush grasp. He involuntarily lets out a long sigh.\nDin swoops down, picks up Grogu, and then plops him down on the chaise next to Luke. \u201cGentle,\u201d he tells Grogu, who stares up at his father with beguiling innocence. \u201c Gentle ,\u201d Din enunciates.\nDin and the babysitter disappear back out into the corridor, destination unknown, and left unsupervised Grogu immediately crawls into Luke\u2019s lap. He does so gently, at least. He doesn\u2019t actually inquire after Luke\u2019s health, but he offers a burble of interested sympathy, extending one of his hands towards Luke\u2019s face. Luke leans down and pretends to nibble on his fingers, to Grogu\u2019s intense joy. \u201cMmm, delicious youngling fingers, my favorite,\u201d Luke says. \u201cJust the kind of snack I was looking for.\u201d\nGrogu chortles, both of his hands now extended up towards Luke\u2019s face. Luke uses his cybernetic hand to steady the child as he pretends to bite at inquisitive little fingers. It feels like his exhaustion slowly oozes out of him, wrung out of his skin by Grogu\u2019s bright happiness. Luke had always found his involuntary conscriptions to cr\u00e8che service as a padawan a theoretically nice but ultimately exhausting exercise--Jedi younglings: very troublesome--but something about Grogu makes even these silly games feel restorative.\n\u201cIf you eat the kid, you won\u2019t have room for lunch,\u201d Din says, striding across the room with a steaming bowl of stew in each hand.\u00a0\n\u201cKriff,\u201d Luke says, straightening. \u201cYour lunch. I can go, let me--\u201d and he goes to lift Grogu off of his lap. Before he can manage it, Din is shoving one of the bowls into his cybernetic hand and plucking Grogu away in one smooth motion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Din says over Grogu\u2019s loud squeal. \u201cI\u2019ll eat later.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s--I don\u2019t want to--\u201d Luke tries, but he wilts in the face of Din\u2019s calm implacability. Din puts Grogu on the floor and hands him the second bowl of stew, which might actually be bigger than the portion he\u2019d brought for Luke. Grogu makes a kind of happy growling noise and immediately begins wielding his comically enormous spoon in pursuit of a chunk of scrubroot.\nLuke eats his stew. It\u2019s delicious.\n\u201cHow\u2019d you manage to avoid the stewed oranges?\u201d Luke asks.\n\u201cTold the protocol droids I\u2019m allergic,\u201d Din says, watching Grogu eat. \u201cThen I told them to kriff off so they\u2019re all afraid of me now.\u201d\n\u201cRude,\u201d Luke says. \u201cBut I can see how it would be effective. They\u2019re a timid bunch. Master Kenobi\u2019s been asking them to do favors for him and a flock of them have started following him around.\u201d\nDin snorts. \u201cHe\u2019s welcome to them.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNot a fan of droids?\u201d Luke asks.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Din says shortly. After a painful-feeling pause, he adds, \u201cMy parents died at Aq Vetina. Separatists. I was raised in the Fighting Corps.\u201d\nLuke does his best not to actually choke on a piece of scrubroot. \u201cYou were  Death Watch ?\u201d he says. \u201cHow did you end up with the Children of the Watch?\u201d\nDin seems uncomfortable. He twists his neck and then cracks a vertebra. \u201cThe distinction is meaningless to me,\u201d he finally says. \u201cI was a foundling, I was raised in the Fighting Corps, when I was grown I earned my armor and I joined the Bounty Hunter\u2019s Guild as part of a covert on Nevarro. The Armorer, she led the covert there. We were the Tribe, not--children, or watchers.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Luke says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was just surprised. You said as much before. I just--well, you don\u2019t seem to hate me that much. And every member of the Death Watch I\u2019ve ever come across has hated the Order. Like--a  lot . This one bounty hunter, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s Death Watch anymore, but--I run into him every few years and he always seems personally offended by my continued existence. Although that might be because we first met when he was trying to pick up a bounty on my brother-in-law and I felt kind of morally obliged to step in.\u201d\nDin stares at him.\n\u201cHan\u2019s an acquired taste,\u201d Luke says weakly. \u201cHe\u2019s the love of my sister\u2019s life so we all just kind of deal with it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d never heard of your order until I found the kid,\u201d Din says. \u201cEven then it was just stories about ancient sorcerers.\u201d\n\u201cNo seething ancient enmity? Great,\u201d Luke says, smiling at him. \u201cThat would\u2019ve been awkward, if your kid ended up a Jedi.\u201d\nDin does not say anything. Tension unfurls inside his Force signature. Luke\u2019s first instinct is to open his mouth and let loose the full force of his dumb kriffing babbling, but he somehow manages to gather enough self-control to bite it back. He gives Din the time to really gather his thoughts. Luke can almost see it happen in the Force, as though the space around him is becoming crisp and orderly.\n\u201cHis sorcery,\u201d Din says finally. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to control it and he exhausts himself, sometimes very badly. Could your people--train him? Help him and keep him safe?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Luke says softly. \u201cBut there are other concerns. I told you about my dad, how he left the Order? Some people love very deeply and they have trouble letting go. Grogu loves you, probably too much to be away from you for any long period of time. But you\u2019re right that he\u2019s just trained enough to be dangerous.\u201d\u00a0\nGrogu is completely preoccupied by licking the bottom of his bowl. He doesn\u2019t seem to notice when Din lifts a hand and places it very gently on the back of his skull. He\u2019s making little  plebplebpleb  noises. It should be disgusting but it\u2019s stupidly adorable.\n\u201cMaster Kenobi recommended that someone be found to tutor him. His kind, they age really slowly. The question of him going to the Temple, it might be better addressed when he\u2019s a little older.\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t he be more attached then?\u201d Din asks.\n\u201cYou\u2019re humanoid, right?\u201d Luke asks.\nDin nods.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking decades from now,\u201d Luke says. \u201cForty, maybe fifty years.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a sharp flare of shock from Din, like static electricity. \u201cAre you kriffing kidding me?\u201d he demands. \u201cThis little womp rat?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be a child for a long time,\u201d Luke says. \u201cThe question of attachment--the ability to love and let go--it\u2019s not really a hypothetical philosophical question for a member of his species. He\u2019ll live for hundreds of years, way longer than anyone he\u2019ll ever know. He\u2019ll lose everyone he loves to death eventually.\u201d\nDin makes a very abbreviated, agonized noise.\n\u201cI\u2019ve met others like him,\u201d Luke offers, desperate to soothe the pain he can feel dagger through Din. \u201cThey love with deep and astonishing compassion. I mean, the Grand Master\u2019s a total asshole but--like, in a loving way. He trained my master. In the Order, a training lineage is a family of sorts, you know? He\u2019s like a grandfather to me.\u201d\n\u201cSo I won\u2019t see him grow up,\u201d Din says. His voice is a little raw.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see him grow,\u201d Luke says. \u201cHe\u2019ll be constantly growing and changing, like all children. But no, he probably won\u2019t be grown to adulthood by the end of your life.\u201d\nDin mutters, \u201cDank  kriffing  farrik.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Luke says. He can feel that Din is struggling with sorrow, trying to wrestle it into a manageable size and failing. He feels like younglings do when they\u2019re first beginning to practice meditation, as though his emotions are a beast too large for him to get his arms around.\nBut Din is not a youngling. He breathes for a while, hand on the back of his child\u2019s head, and then he seems to deflate--acceptance, even if it\u2019s not of the sort that the Jedi practices. Din\u2019s tastes of long, bloody experience.\n\u201cHow do I get him a tutor?\u201d Din asks wearily.\nBefore Luke has a chance to answer, a protocol droid shouts from the corridor in a timid warble, \u201cUh, Mand\u2019alor? Your presence, sir, is required by Master Kenobi,\u201d and it titters to itself nervously.\u00a0\nDin exhales harshly and shakes his head. He stands surprisingly fluidly for someone wearing full beskar plate. When Luke goes to do the same, Din shakes his head sharply and puts out a staying hand. \u201cYou should rest,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re in pain, I can see it. The kid\u2019ll sleep now, he won\u2019t trouble you.\u201d\n\u201cThe negotiations--\u201d Luke tries.\nDin says, \u201cThey\u2019ll be fine without you. Kenobi\u2019s got the whole thing on rails. Besides, if you faint again, Blisk\u2019ll probably end up with the Darksaber when he guts me in my sleep.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t faint,\u201d Luke says irritably but he doesn\u2019t protest when Din plucks a limp, unprotesting Grogu off of the floor and drops him onto the chaise next to Luke.\n\u201cNap,\u201d Din tells Grogu firmly. \u201cRemember, be gentle.\u201d\nGrogu coos sleepily.\n\u201cYou, too,\u201d Din says to Luke. As he passes the chaise, he puts out his hand and runs the tips of his fingers--fore, middle, ring--along the edge of Luke\u2019s hairline. It feels like Luke has been branded by this thoughtless, inquisitive touch, and it cracks open a kind of desperate hunger, somewhere deep inside of Luke, for a more deliberate caress. He wants to feel Din\u2019s fingers rake through his hair and dig into the flesh of his scalp in a secure, confident hold. He wants it so badly that he actually has to yank up some very quick and shoddy shields, lest he corrupt the innocent baby wriggling closer to rest his head on Luke\u2019s thigh.\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of kriffed, Grogu,\u201d Luke whispers to the baby after Din has left.\nGrogu says, knowledgeably, \u201cBlebleble,\u201d and his eyes slowly blink closed. Luke means to stay awake for at least a little while, to make sure that the baby is safe, but it\u2019s so hypnotic, watching him breathe, that very soon Luke, too, is fast asleep.\n~\nLuke and Master Kenobi hike out to the landing dock at sunset to update the Council from the holoprojection suite on their ship. It\u2019s very disorienting to walk out of Sundari\u2019s false gloom straight into the full force of the actual sunset. Mandalore\u2019s sun is huge and there are no clouds to obscure it as its enormous red mass sinks below the horizon. Luke feels scalded under its gaze, the skin of his face hot and scraped raw by the sand.\n\u201cHow are you feeling, Luke?\u201d Master Tano asks, after the negotiations have been discussed in depth and everyone agrees that Master Kenobi\u2019s progress seems promising.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Luke says. \u201cIt was just exhaustion.\u201d\n\u201c--and vacuum sickness, muscle tearing, third-degree burns, and a concussion,\u201d Master Kenobi finishes waspishly.\n\u201cAnd now I\u2019m fine,\u201d Luke says. \u201cMy shoulder\u2019s nearly good as new.\u201d\nMaster Tano rolls her eyes so hard that her holoprojection momentarily fuzzes out. Before she has the chance to say anything too mean, Grand Master Yoda cuts her off. \u201cSeen the child, you have. Your thoughts we would hear.\u201d\nLuke instinctively straightens under the Grand Master\u2019s inquisitive stare. \u201cGrogu? Uh, I don\u2019t know what I could add that wasn\u2019t in Master Kenobi\u2019s initial report. He\u2019s very--I mean, he\u2019s a baby? He\u2019s a good-humored, curious child. I don\u2019t know how long he was with Maul, but he doesn\u2019t feel touched by the Dark side, not really. It\u2019s clear that he loves his father.\u201d\n\u201cTo forming attachments, he is prone?\u201d the Grand Master prods.\nLuke says, \u201cI mean, to his dad, yes?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Master Kenobi smoothly interjects. \u201cHe\u2019s attached to Luke already, it\u2019s quite clear.\u201d\nAll of the masters turn their intense attention on Luke, who suddenly feels like he\u2019s trapped in the crosshairs of a full battalion of battle droids. Luke\u2019s face flushes. \u201cHe\u2019s just a friendly little guy. I think he hasn\u2019t known many other Force-sensitive beings.\u201d\n\u201cThe child used Force healing on Luke the day they met,\u201d Master Kenobi tells the Council, dry as dust.\n\u201cEvidence of attachment, that is not,\u201d the Grand Master says, putting both hands on top of his gimmer stick and sighing with his whole body. \u201cBut troubling, it may be.\u201d\nMaster Koon says, \u201cThe question of attachment aside, there are also security concerns. Can the child be left on Mandalore safely?\u201d\nMaster Secura barks out a low laugh. \u201cThe only place in the galaxy he\u2019d be safer is the Temple. They are feral in their protection of their young, those Mandalorians.\u201d\n\u201cI concur,\u201d Master Kenobi says. \u201cAlthough Luke stepped in to handle those bounty hunters, the Mand\u2019alor is demonstrably a capable warrior. That said, I think it would be wise to open an investigation into the activities of this individual known as Gideon. If he is interested in obtaining Force-sensitive children, the Order must know.\u201d\n\u201cConcur as well, do I,\u201d Master Yoda says. He slams his gimmer stick twice on the floor. \u201cInvestigate, we will. Your recommendation we will consider, Obi-Wan. Stay with the Mand\u2019alor, the Child will for now.\u201d\nLuke and Master Kenobi murmur their agreement and bow in unison as the holoprojection cuts out abruptly. The lights in the suite flicker and dim as the recording software automatically powers down. Luke feels a little disoriented; it takes him a moment to realize that it\u2019s because the architecture in the ship is so delicate and curving, designed to mimic the aesthetic of the Jedi Temple. Luke\u2019s gotten used to the stark, blocky architecture of Mandalore over the last few days.\n\u201cThe Mand\u2019alor asked me to recommend a tutor for Grogu,\u201d Luke says.\u00a0\nMaster Kenobi hums thoughtfully.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s easy to get along with Grogu,\u201d Luke says, \u201cbut this political situation seems kind of precarious. It\u2019d have to be someone who can take care of themselves. Maybe a monk from the Temple of the Kyber--they\u2019re hardier than most of the other orders.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re capable warriors,\u201d Master Kenobi says agreeably, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sure a Guardian of the Whills would suit this task. They\u2019re rarely more than slightly Force-sensitive.\u201d\n\u201cIt would be a very bad idea to assign a knight or a master to this,\u201d Luke says, starting to feel a little agitated. \u201cPolitically, I mean. Wouldn\u2019t it? Like the Order is overstepping its bounds, supporting one political faction over another instead of serving as independent mediators.\u201d\n\u201cI suspect it could cause problems, yes,\u201d Master Kenobi says.\nLuke\u2019s neck feels tight. He twists it until the vertebra audibly cracks and when that doesn\u2019t quite fix him, he begins to pace. It\u2019s only ten steps to cross the width of the holoprojection suite. \u201cIt would be so much safer if the two of them came back to Coruscant. But they can\u2019t, not really, because Din--he\u2019s going to be a good Mand\u2019alor, isn\u2019t he? That\u2019s what you were after, with these meetings. You were trying to convince him to stay and take on the job.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a thankless one,\u201d Master Kenobi says softly. \u201cBut yes, I believe he will serve his people capably.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s strong enough to please the martialists, righteous enough to keep the New Mandalorians in line, and his creed won\u2019t allow him to stand for the subjugation of the troopers. He has the best chance of uniting this planet, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\nMaster Kenobi says, \u201cThe will of the Force seems rather unambiguous on this point.\u201d\nLuke continues, almost fretfully, \u201cGrogu has a huge heart. It has to be the right tutor, someone who understands that he doesn\u2019t need to repress anything, just--temper it. Forge it into real compassion, not the kind of benign benevolence that so many Jedi seem to think is an acceptable substitute.\u201d He shoots Master Kenobi an apologetic look over his shoulder as his feet continue their furious pacing. \u201cNo offense, Master.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t disagree, Luke,\u201d Master Kenobi says.\n\u201cMaster Windu used to tell me that releasing your emotions into the Force was only one way of interpreting the Jedi Code. He invented Vaapad because he found he could achieve peace by fully experiencing his emotions and then absorbing them back into himself--I always used to call it his \u2018closed system.\u2019 It can be dangerous, if you don\u2019t do it properly. But if you can, it opens you up so much.\u201d Luke\u2019s shoulder twinges; he reaches up with his cybernetic hand and presses against a knot forming in the muscle just behind his neck. \u201cI think that would suit Grogu, don\u2019t you? True understanding of the self. Deep compassion.\u201d\n\u201cI think it would be a rare master who could train him,\u201d Master Kenobi says.\n\u201cMaster Windu could have,\u201d Luke says morosely.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it fortuitous, then, that Mace\u2019s last student has yet to take a padawan?\u201d Master Kenobi replies.\nLuke snorts. \u201cBe serious.\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d Master Kenobi says mildly. When Luke shoots him an irritated look, Master Kenobi is sitting in his council chair, legs crossed with nonchalant grace. He looks very relaxed and not at all like a person who just suggested that Luke--\n\u201cAre you saying I should leave the Order?\u201d Luke squawks, stumbling to a standstill. \u201cAm I really that terrible of a Jedi?\u201d\nMaster Kenobi\u2019s eyes are very gentle. \u201cNo, Luke,\u201d he says. \u201cI think you\u2019re an exceptional Jedi.\u201d He smiles and tilts his head, hair falling across his forehead. No wonder they\u2019d made him one of the faces of the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars--he looks like the poster child of a Jedi, wise and dignified and handsome. \u201cIt\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve seen you at peace, Luke. What do you feel here that you don\u2019t on Coruscant?\u201d\nLuke frowns at him. \u201cI--don\u2019t know?\u201d\u00a0\nBut that\u2019s not quite true. Master Kenobi\u2019s expression of benevolent patience suggests he knows as much. For a few seconds, Luke struggles to grasp what has been eluding him for the last several days--what feeling has he failed, again and again, to recognize and release to the Force? It clings to him with ferocious intensity. Attempts to identify it as lust or fascination have failed. Is it passion? Is it  love ? But it resonates in him too deeply to be anything so selfish or tempestuous.\n\u201cThere\u2019s harmony here,\u201d Luke hears himself say.\u00a0\nMaster Kenobi smiles, then. \u201cYes, Luke,\u201d he says. \u201cI had suspected as much.\u201d\n~\nUnusually, it was just before sunrise when Master Windu woke Luke and took him down to the salle, the sconces in the hallway set to half-light and the cleaning droids scuttling through their rounds like mice. He unclipped his lightsaber from his belt and put it on the floor in front of his knees as he settled into a meditative posture. Luke mirrored him, sleepy and confused but still game for whatever this would turn out to be.\n\u201cTell me about harmony, padawan,\u201d Master Windu said. \u201cEyes closed.\u201d\nLuke obligingly snapped his eyes shut. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of chaos,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Master Windu said drily after a few seconds of silence. \u201cWhat else?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like resonance,\u201d Luke tried. \u201cOne thing can\u2019t have harmony, it has to be lots of things, working together. Like a musical chord.\u201d\nWith Luke\u2019s eyes closed, he found himself automatically reaching out to the Force, trusting it to serve as a kind of vision. His master, as always, read in the Force as unyielding and self-contained. He did not radiate very much, not like Leia or Master Kenobi, who was always giving his emotions over to the Force like one of the fountains. Master Windu reminded Luke of the deep underground lakes on Ilum, which Luke was in a good position to know because he\u2019d fallen into one during his quest for a kyber crystal a few years ago.\n\u201cChaos is when things push against each other, when they\u2019re in conflict. Harmony is being different but still working together. Like when Leia and I were partners in Master Kenobi\u2019s seminar and had to write a poem together and she wanted it to be about tooka-cats and I didn\u2019t.\u201d\nSomething faint leaked out of Master Windu like a tendril of smoke. Luke didn\u2019t have a chance to identify it before it disappeared. \u201cYes,\u201d his master said, voice a little strangled. \u201cThat\u2019s a good metaphor. Have you been able to find harmony in your saber work, Luke?\u201d\nLuke frowned to himself. \u201cI tuned my kyber crystal so it sounded right.\u201d\n\u201cHarmony between yourself and your saber, yes,\u201d Master Windu said, in the leading way he did when that meant Luke had only managed part of the answer.\n\u201cDo you mean between me and my opponent? Isn\u2019t the point of fighting to win? That doesn\u2019t seem very harmonious,\u201d Luke said.\n\u201cSo the goal of fighting with a lightsaber is to make chaos,\u201d Master Windu said.\nLuke said, \u201cYes?\u201d And then, \u201cWait, no, that can\u2019t be right. If a fight is chaotic, that means it\u2019s uncontrolled, and other people could be hurt.\u201d\nMaster Windu did not answer. So Luke was right, maybe, and just needed to keep going. He scrunched his eyes tighter, trying to focus, to  understand .\n\u201cHarmony is about different things working together--so, it\u2019s opponents working together? To end the fight? That\u2019s the common goal. Or to have fun,\u201d Luke added, thinking of how often he and Leia found themselves in the salle just experimenting with the different forms. Leia really liked Makashi but she thought it was too impractical to specialize in so she\u2019d only practice it with Luke when they were goofing off. \u201cIs this about picking a form, Master?\u201d\nMaster Windu released a bubble of something small and fiercely effervescent into the Force. \u201cYes, Luke,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHarmony through a form,\u201d Luke mused. \u201cSo you want to tune your body like you tune a kyber crystal?\u201d\nMaster Windu said, \u201cYou can open your eyes.\u201d When Luke blinked a few times to clear his vision, Master Windu was already rising to his feet. \u201cWhen I was your age, Luke, I preferred Djem So. It was a rational choice. I\u2019m taller and stronger than most humanoids.\u201d Luke couldn\u2019t help frowning a little. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Master Windu asked.\n\u201cI was just thinking of Leia,\u201d Luke admitted as he unfolded his legs and made to stand. \u201cShe likes Djem So, too, even though she\u2019s not tall or strong. But she\u2019s rational, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\u201cYou tell me,\u201d Master Windu said drily.\n\u201cShe\u2019s rational,\u201d Luke said more firmly. \u201cShe uses philosophy to win arguments all the time, even with Mom and Uncle Obi-Wan--that is, Master Kenobi. But she said that Djem So was right for her. Do you think she meant that it was harmonious?\u201d\nMaster Windu said, \u201cI don\u2019t pretend to understand your sister, padawan, but yeah, probably.\u201d\nLuke absently reached out and called his lightsaber to his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way about any of the forms, Master.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t either,\u201d Master Windu said. \u201cPut your lightsaber over by the stands, Luke, we\u2019re going to use practice sabers today. I don\u2019t want you to worry about burns while we try something out.\u201d Luke obligingly turned his palm and pushed his saber away with flex of his wrist, trusting the Force to put it down safely on one of the benches. \u201cLike I said, I thought that Djem So was the rational choice.\u201d\n\u201cBut you use Vaapad,\u201d Luke said, suddenly making the connection and feeling incredibly dumb. \u201cIs that why you invented it, Master? Because you didn\u2019t harmonize with anything else?\u201d\n\u201cFor the most part, yes. I needed a saber form that could follow me deep into my emotions, because that\u2019s where I find my strength.\u201d Master Windu called two training sabers from the display wall above the doors and Luke snagged the smaller one as it raced by his head, taking a moment to test the grip and feel its weight in his hand. It didn\u2019t feel as nice as the saber that he\u2019d built for himself, but it would be fine for a few hours of practice. \u201cWhere\u2019s your strength, padawan?\u201d\nLuke thumbed on the practice saber to check the blade length. \u201cMy Force sensitivity?\u201d he said distractedly.\nMaster Windu hummed in the back of his throat, which meant Luke had missed the point. Luke turned off the practice saber and took a second to really think. \u201cI guess I listen to the Force,\u201d he said finally. \u201cIt tells me stuff all the time, like people that are important or things I have to do.\u201d\n\u201cYou trust the Force,\u201d Master Windu said. His eyes were soft in the corners when Luke looked up at him. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty rare, Luke. It\u2019s easy for us Jedi to say we understand the will of the Force without really trusting it.\u201d\n\u201cSo when Master Yoda tells us that we have to submit to the Force?\u201d Luke said.\nMaster Windu\u2019s expression stayed stern but there was that bubble, again, fierce and effervescent and almost joyful as it joined the swirling eddies of the Force. \u201cYou just have to listen, Luke, and trust.\u201d\n~\nLuke wakes up with the sun.\u00a0\nHe lays in bed for a few extra minutes, luxuriating in the feeling of being truly mended--no headache, no deep pain in his back and shoulder--and then, like a sudden electrical shock, he remembers the previous evening. Perhaps Luke is too old to be seeking absolution from authority figures, but that doesn\u2019t keep him from feeling deep relief at the idea of having been given permission.\nHe stumbles out of bed and pulls on the nearest clothes that he can get his hands on--tunic, trousers, tabard, belt--and then yanks on his boots. He calls his lightsaber to his hand when he\u2019s already halfway across the room, clipping it onto his belt with an automatic, thoughtless motion. He\u2019s out into the corridor before he remembers to think of personal grooming, but it\u2019s too late by then to turn back. He rakes his hands through his hair, combing it back from his face, and hopes that\u2019ll be enough.\nIt\u2019s surprisingly easy to find his way back to Din and Grogu\u2019s suite, between the colors of the doors and the beacon of Grogu\u2019s presence in the Force. Maybe Luke is actually learning his way around this jakrab\u2019s warren. It\u2019s a warming thought.\nDin answers Luke\u2019s third knock. He\u2019s wearing a tunic and trousers, helmet and boots on, but none of the rest of his armor.\n\u201cDid I wake you?\u201d Luke asks, suddenly struck by this thought. He\u2019d assumed, after seeing Din those mornings in Ne\u2019tra Park, that he was an early riser like Luke, but maybe that had been incorrect.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the sling?\u201d Din counters.\n\u201cI can feel that it\u2019s healed,\u201d Luke says.\nDin says, \u201cBlisk specifically said not to believe your mystical bantha shit sorcery,\u201d and steps back, tacitly gesturing Luke inside of his quarters.\n\u201cNo offense to Blisk, but I know when I\u2019m healed,\u201d Luke says as he steps past him. \u201cI\u2019m good. Really.\u201d There\u2019s no sign of Grogu on any of the myriad chaises, but that\u2019s not surprising; the baby feels like he\u2019s dreaming, likely still tucked away in bed. Over by the wall of staggeringly enormous windows, a hard-backed chair is angled away from a table with a steaming cup of something next to an empty plate. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt your breakfast.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Din says shortly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nLuke turns to him. Din is only a few feet behind him, looking unbelievably approachable without his usual chest plating and pauldrons. He\u2019s still taller and broader than Luke but in a much less physically overwhelming way. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d Luke says distractedly.\nDin tilts his head to the left in silent inquiry. It occurs to Luke-- now , however many days into their acquaintance--that interpreting Din\u2019s gestures had come to him with such ease that it\u2019s as though they share a common language. Luke had thought it was the Force. That\u2019s always the safest assumption, when it comes to strange shit that Luke knows instinctively. But it is dawning on him, as the light begins to spill out onto the floor through those huge windows, that maybe it is something else entirely.\n\u201cI\u2019m staying,\u201d Luke says abruptly. \u201cOr, I will stay. If you\u2019ll have me. I\u2019ll tutor Grogu.\u201d\nDin makes an aborted motion and then stops himself, hands clenching at his sides. \u201cYour people told you to stay?\u201d he asks stiffly.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Luke says. \u201cI\u2019d take a leave of absence from the Order.\u201d\nDin\u2019s helmet twitches, very slightly, like he\u2019d started to make that same inquiring gesture and decided against it at the last minute.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing as leaving completely, but it\u2019s--well, it\u2019s kind of the same thing, but there\u2019s a door that stays open for me to go back. If they need me for something.\u201d Luke can\u2019t help self-consciously rolling his eyes. \u201cYou know, Sith-killing Skywalker.\u201d It\u2019s tempting to just stay on this superficial level, let sarcasm carry him through, but Luke can\u2019t quite keep his grip on the bratty act. \u201cIf I--if I get married, I\u2019ll leave for real. That door closes.\u201d\nDin does reach out, then. One of his hands grabs Luke\u2019s right arm, just above the elbow. The other one slides under his left arm and anchors itself on his hip. \u201cLuke,\u201d he rasps.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only been a few days, I know, I\u2019m not--this isn\u2019t--I don\u2019t  expect --\u201d Luke tries. He lifts his left hand and presses his fingertips against the edge of Din\u2019s helmet, framing the transparisteel eye slit. He\u2019s close enough that if it were clear he\u2019d be able to see something of Din\u2019s face, but the transparisteel is smoked and impenetrable.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s lucky, then that Luke doesn\u2019t need his eyes to see the truth of Din.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to stay,\u201d Luke manages.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Din says, very, very quietly. In half an exhale his hand has gone from Luke\u2019s elbow to the back of his head, cupping his skull. Luke feels a delirious clench, like Din\u2019s hand is actually closing around his heart deep inside of his chest cavity. Din guides him forward with steady, inexorable pressure until their foreheads are touching. The beskar is cold against his skin. Luke has to close his eyes as he fumbles to grab the back of Din\u2019s helmet, securing them together. When he inhales, it feels like he\u2019s breathing in the sunrise.\nThey stand there for--five minutes? forever? not long enough--and then Din says, \u201cAfter we\u2019re married, you\u2019re getting that hand plated with beskar.\u201d"
