    "text": "So, dating Matt is not actually that different from not dating Matt.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFoggy does, of course, give him shit that he never noticed.\n\u201cTen years, Matt,\u201d Foggy says at one point. \u201cTen years and you never noticed.\u201d\n\u201cSome heartbeats are unusually fast!\u201d Matt answers defensively.\nFoggy shakes his head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I did my waiting. Ten years of it. In Azkaban.\u201d\n\u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen is hardly Azkaban, Foggy.\u201d\n\u201cNope, it\u2019s worse.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that-\u201c\n\u201cTEN YEARS.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor the first week they\u2019re together, they try and hide it in the office because of an attempt to keep the workplace professional. It works okay until Karen returns earlier than they expected from her lunch break to find Matt between Foggy and a wall with Foggy\u2019s tongue in his mouth, and there\u2019s no amount of saying \u201cno homo\u201d that will fix that.\nFoggy knows. He tried. Even as Matt took the dignified route of letting Karen thwack him with a phonebook while yelling at them for not telling her.\n\u00a0\nFor the second week they\u2019re together, Karen plays \u201cI Just Had Sex\u201d every morning when they arrive at the office.\n\u201cThat is not true every time you play that, you know,\u201d Foggy finally says when he hangs up his coat. Karen arches an eyebrow.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to be able to hear your heartbeat to know that that\u2019s bullshit,\u201d she answers. \u201cAlso Matt\u2019s got that overly pleased with himself smirk on behind you.\u201d\nFoggy rounds on him as Matt serenely says \u201cI assure you, there is nothing overly about it.\u201d\nFoggy throws up his hands. \u201cI\u2019m not discussing my sex life with you, Karen!\u201d he yells as he walks into his office.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she calls back. \u201cYou will. In time.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd then after all that, there\u2019s not a lot that\u2019s different.\nThey still take care of the same kind of cases. They still bicker over the proper way to approach them. They still refuse to drink Karen\u2019s terrible coffee.\nOnly now, Foggy will absently press a kiss to Matt\u2019s forehead and Matt will grin up at him with that big dopey grin that Foggy only used to see when they were drunk. Matt will run his fingers through Foggy\u2019s hair while they\u2019re studying case files with whatever hand isn\u2019t clutching a slice of pizza. It\u2019s natural, and it\u2019s calm, and there\u2019s something so peaceful to it that he can\u2019t really assign an amount.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThere\u2019s also the sex.\nWhich, yeah, also pretty cool.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo how\u2019s life with Lucifer?\u201d Natasha asks with a smirk when they\u2019re having coffee.\n\u201cWell, if you believe certain hate groups, I and all my fellow queer folk have been living with Lucifer for a long time, so really, I\u2019m quite used to it.\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Natasha sips her mocha serenely. \u201cNot used to the banging him part, though.\u201d\nFoggy rolls his eyes. \u201cNo comment.\u201d\nNatasha swirls her drink. \u201cYou\u2019re happy, though?\u201d\nHe can\u2019t help the goofy grin that pops up on his face. \u201cYeah. I am.\u201d\n\u201cGood. I don\u2019t want to have to kick anybody\u2019s ass.\u201d\nFoggy snorts. \u201cLiiiiiiiie.\u201d\nShe smirks a little in response. \u201cWhat does your partner think of all this?\u201d\nFoggy\u2019s confused for a second before he remembers that the Avengers don\u2019t actually know who Daredevil is. \u201cMatt?\u201d\n\u201cYes, him.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Foggy thinks about it. \u201cI think he\u2019s surprised. But happy that I\u2019m happy.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not a lie. Foggy can see it in his face sometimes, before he hides it. Confusion that it\u2019s him Foggy\u2019s picked, that everything has aligned so that the world doesn\u2019t suck for Matt Murdock. It kind of breaks his heart.\n\u201cGood. I\u2019ve decided I want to meet them.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve decided that just recently, have you?\u201d\nShe smirks again. Natasha uses her laughs carefully, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Foggy can tell when she\u2019s amused enough that she has the urge. \u201cRecently enough.\u201d\nFoggy raises his eyebrows. \u201cIs it a fair assumption that you\u2019re just going to randomly show up at our office without warning me?\u201d\n\u201cA little more than fair.\u201d\n\u201cTerrific.\u201d\n\u201cSam will not be able to warn you as Sam is unaware of my decision,\u201d she adds. Damn. Of course she knew he\u2019d be counting on that.\n\u201cPlease do not terrify my friends and coworkers.\u201d He\u2019s not actually sure she would. Matt, he knows isn\u2019t frightened of her. An unwise move, in his opinion, as one should always be a little afraid of Natasha. Karen might, but Karen also disguises steel with soft cuddly smiles, so it\u2019s honestly a tossup.\n\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt crawls into bed around three and Foggy absently reaches out to poke at him. Foggy always pokes at Matt when he\u2019s back from Daredeviling. If he\u2019s there and solid and makes some sort of grumpy noise, everything is all right.\nMatt\u2019s grumpy noise is, in this case, overrun by Foggy\u2019s groan. \u201cDude. No.\u201d\n\u201cWhat dude no?\u201d Matt\u2019s voice is muffled by the pillow he\u2019s faceplanted in.\n\u201cBody armor. In bed. No. Take it off.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, Mr. Nelson, you\u2019re trying to seduce me.\u201d Foggy can hear his grin even through the pillow and absently smacks him on the head. At least he took the helmet off.\n\u201cEver want to get seduced again, you\u2019re takin\u2019 off the suit.\u201d\nMatt gets the suit off impressively quickly. While still under the covers, too. Ten out of ten, Mr. Murdock.\n\u201cBetter?\u201d\nFoggy pokes him again to make sure. Just abs.\n\u201cMmm-hm.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re all in one piece?\u201d\n\u201cLast I checked.\u201d\n\u201cYou checked recently though, right?\u201d\nMatt snorts. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cMmm. Good.\u201d Foggy yawns. \u201cNat wants to meet you and Karen.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s met me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but not during your day job.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cShow up randomly. Try and make you shit yourselves. You know. Nat\u2019s deal.\u201d\n\u201cMm\u2019kay.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to tell her no? Cause I can probably badger her into it.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s your friend.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t-\u201c he yawns again. \u201cDon\u2019t want her to make you uncomfortable or something.\u201d\nThere\u2019s silence long enough that Foggy starts to suspect that Matt\u2019s fallen asleep and he starts to doze off himself when Matt boops him in the nose.\n\u201cEhhhh. Why.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re real.\u201d\nFoggy cracks an eye open. Matt\u2019s looking at him, hair all flat from the helmet like it gets sometimes, face soft and gently confused, like he\u2019s pleased but doesn\u2019t understand why.\n\u201cCourse I am. Not going to stop anytime soon.\u201d He pulls at Matt\u2019s hair a little until it doesn\u2019t look weird anymore. \u201cGo to sleep. Got work in the morning. Don\u2019t make me groggy.\u201d\nMatt gives him that tiny contented smile that Foggy doesn\u2019t see enough. \u201cGroggy Foggy.\u201d\n\u201cSee, this is the only good reason you\u2019ve got your weird \u2018not tell the Avengers the secret identity\u2019 thing.\u201d Foggy closes his eye. \u201cThe scary devil thing kind of evaporates when you know what a loser you actually are.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy folds his arms and fixes them with his best accusing glare.\nSteve, Bruce, and Thor are the only ones who shift guiltily. Sam doesn\u2019t, but Sam doesn\u2019t count, because Foggy knows he tried his best to prevent this, and also Foggy doesn\u2019t want to strangle him. Bucky, Clint, Natasha, and Tony just stand there in their bold faced lack of shame.\n\u201cYou have a lovely office,\u201d Bruce mumbles.\n\u201cIf you guys say you just happened to be in the neighborhood,\u201d Foggy informs them. \u201cI will beat you. With Clint\u2019s foot. That will be dismembered from his body.\u201d\nClint frowns. \u201cWhy my foot?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re closest.\u201d\nClint edges behind Natasha slightly.\n\u201cFoggy, who are you-\u201c Karen stops next to him. \u201cOh. Hi.\u201d\nThor waves. \u201cHello, Lady Karen.\u201d\nSteve smiles a little. \u201cHi again, Ms. Page.\u201d\n\u201cKaren\u2019s fine,\u201d she says a little faintly. \u00a0\u201cFoggy? Explain.\u201d\nFoggy intensifies the glare. \u201cNatasha thinks she\u2019s funny.\u201d\n\u201cIntroduce us to the lady, don\u2019t be a dick,\u201d Tony says.\n\u201cSays the guy wearing sunglasses indoors.\u201d\nTony pushes his sunglasses further up his nose. \u201cFuck you, Nelson, I look great.\u201d\nFoggy sighs. \u201cAvengers and Sam, Karen. Karen, this is Avengers and Sam.\u201d\n\u201cWhy does Sam get a separate introduction?\u201d Clint asks.\n\u201cBecause I actually like Sam.\u201d\nKaren\u2019s shock seems to be fading. \u201cDon\u2019t let Daredevil hear you say that, he\u2019ll think you\u2019re ditching him for another superhero.\u201d\n\u201cYou should,\u201d Sam says. \u201cI have wings, way cooler. James Bond can\u2019t even fly, you know.\u201d\n\u201cPass.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m also very attractive.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re also hitting on that barista down the road from the Tower,\u201d Bucky mutters.\n\u201cSo you know Daredevil too.\u201d Natasha\u2019s voice is intrigued. \u201cDid he just adopt your law firm?\u201d\nKaren grins. \u201cHe\u2019s got a thing about strays.\u201d\nThere\u2019s the sound of the door opening. \u201cFoggy?\u201d Matt\u2019s voice is far too innocent. \u201cAre there a lot of people here?\u201d\nFoggy walks to the door and calmly gives Matt his arm. \u201cYeah, the Avengers showed up.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah. You mentioned them.\u201d\nFoggy carefully does not roll his eyes at Matt\u2019s \u201cbutter wouldn\u2019t melt\u201d tone as he leads Matt around the Avengers. \u201cSo kind of you to notice.\u201d\n\u201cYou must be Matt.\u201d Tony slides his hands into his pockets. \u201cHave you met the horned menace too? Well, you must have, the Fogmaster\u2019s boning him.\u201d\nFoggy knows Matt can hear his heartbeat go all funny and he hates it. \u201cI\u2019m going to poison your coffee very very soon,\u201d he tells Tony.\n\u201cHe won\u2019t notice,\u201d Steve mutters. \u201cHe puts so much crap in it anyway.\u201d\n\u201cHey, just because you grew up during the Depression and you think adding anything other than water to chewed coffee grounds is excessive-\u201c\nFoggy loudly clears his throat. Sam snorts.\n\u201cAvengers,\u201d he says clearly. \u201cMatt. Matt, Avengers. They all look like assholes except for Sam.\u201d\n\u201cSam\u2019s offered to switch out with Daredevil for Foggy\u2019s hand,\u201d Karen says, eyes gleaming. Foggy hates all of his friends except for Matt.\n\u201cReally?\u201d Matt looks mildly amused. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Daredevil would enjoy that.\u201d\n\u201cThat is why,\u201d Foggy growls through clenched teeth. \u201cWe would not mention it to him.\u201d\nMatt just raises an eyebrow.\n\u201cYou could, though,\u201d Clint says. \u201cMight get some awesome possessive sex out of the deal. That\u2019s always fun.\u201d\n\u201cWould everyone quit making statements about me getting laid.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t get anything out of him,\u201d Natasha addresses Matt. \u201cHave you heard anything?\u201d\n\u201cI have.\u201d Matt smirks. \u201cNothing but vociferously good reviews, I promise.\u201d\nKaren chokes on her coffee. Nope, Foggy hates Matt too.\n\u201cALL RIGHT,\u201d Foggy says loudly. \u201cAND ON THAT NOTE I THINK WE\u2019RE DONE HERE.\u201d\n\u201cNo, hold up.\u201d Tony\u2019s grinning. \u201cI want to hear about these reviews. Like, ten out of ten, or mind blown, what are we talking here, as a connoisseur of such reviews?\u201d\nMatt must be picking up on the \u201cif you say a god damn word I will dunk your suit in glitter\u201d vibes that Foggyis shooting his way because he just smiles slightly and shakes his head.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he says ruefully. \u201cAnother time. We\u2019ve got a case to work on.\u201d\n\u201cCan you get to your office okay with excess people?\u201d Foggy asks, because he will keep up this charade for Matt no matter how bad he wants to kick his ass.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He absently pats Foggy\u2019s lower back, a fairly standard gesture for him these days. \u201cThanks.\u201d He navigates his way to his office and Foggy turns back to the Avengers, who all have weird expressions on their faces.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Steve says too quickly. Foggy narrows his eyes and wonders what he wants more, to grill superheroes about being off or to finally have them out of his office.\n\u201cAll right, Matt\u2019s right, we\u2019ve got a case. Thank you for showing up to try and menace my coworkers.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are friends for?\u201d Tony breezes out of the office. Sam starts herding everyone else out.\n\u201cAll right, come on, guys, leave Foggy in peace. See you later, man.\u201d\n\u201cBye, dude.\u201d\n\u201cIt was nice to meet you, Karen. Say the same for Matt for me.\u201d\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d\nSam closes the door behind him and Karen turns to Foggy with a grin.\n\u201cVociferous, huh?\u201d\n\u201cYou are on the list of people I\u2019m going to beat with Clint\u2019s foot.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means.\u201d\nFoggy walks into Matt\u2019s office to see him tilted back in his chair. He\u2019s got that look on his face he gets when he\u2019s listening in to someone else\u2019s funny conversations.\n\u201cIs it two floors down fighting about butter versus bacon for what they\u2019d rather give up again?\u201d Foggy asks. Matt shakes his head slightly, looking a little pleased with himself. Foggy decides he doesn\u2019t want to know.\n\u201cVociferous? Really?\u201d\nMatt grins, face still pointed towards the ceiling. \u201cIs that not how one could describe the feedback I\u2019ve been getting?\u201d He lets out a little cackle, obviously at something Foggy can\u2019t hear.\nFoggy shakes his head. \u201cSuperheroes are all idiots.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a superhero.\u201d\nFoggy rolls his eyes and kisses Matt\u2019s forehead. \u201cI know, you\u2019re a big scary vigilante who don\u2019t need no law.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re both sickening,\u201d Karen informs them. \u201cI want a raise.\u201d\n\u201cYou may now get three bread crusts instead of two,\u201d Matt says seriously.\n\u201cGod bless us, every one,\u201d she deadpans right back.\n\u00a0\nKaren texts Foggy a photo that evening. It\u2019s of a note, typed from a computer that simply says DROP THE ANDRIEV CASE.\nFoggy texts back kind of wish they\u2019d used comic sans.\nHe gets two responses in just a few seconds.\n\nLoser.\n\n\nBulgarian mob?\n\nFoggy\u2019s honestly amazed how many different criminal by organizations labeled simply by primary country of origin there are in the city. He feels like The Godfather lied to him. Can\u2019t think of anyone else who\u2019d want use to ditch the Andriev case. The Andrievs are a lovely old couple in Hell\u2019s Kitchen who are being terrorized because they refuse to vacate the building they\u2019ve lived in since they moved to America over fifty years ago.\n\nDoes it go on The List?\n\n\u201cThe List\u201d is what Karen and Foggy call the list of things they don\u2019t tell Matt. It includes that Foggy and Karen once had a lengthy drunken conversation about how attractive Steve is, that it was Karen who once accidentally mixed up the ibuprofen and the heavy duty painkillers, and most threatening letters they receive for the cases they take on. This is because they usually never come to anything, and if Matt knew he would try and beat all of them up, which would result in probably fewer threats, but more Matt with the shit kicked out of him, something Foggy and Karen have a vested interest in avoiding.\n\nYeah, for now.\n\n\nGot it. \n\n\u00a0\nSteve and Bucky drop by a few days later with a package. Foggy looks at it warily.\n\u201cIt\u2019s from Tony,\u201d Steve says. Foggy cranks the wariness up to eleven.\n\u201cI feel like if I open it it\u2019s going to explode sequins or something.\u201d Tony has a very strange sense of humor.\n\u201cHe says it\u2019s a new iPad to replace the one Bruce accidentally stepped on.\u201d\n\u201cSure, that\u2019s what he says.\u201d Foggy pokes it with a pencil.\nSteve looks at Bucky with a shit eating grin. \u201cWould you like Bucky to open it for you to make sure?\u201d\nFoggy looks up at Bucky. \u201cI feel like the idea of you picking sequins out of the plates in your arms for weeks is hilarious.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like dangling you off the roof by your underwear is also hilarious,\u201d Bucky says mildly. Foggy snorts and opens up the box. It is in fact an iPad, with a large Post-It on the front that says STARKPADS ARE BETTER. LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU COME TO YOUR SENSES. I HAVE ONE WAITING FOR YOU WITH YOUR NAME LITERALLY ON IT.\n\u201cIs him threatening you with some mega atomic wedgie normal?\u201d Karen asks from her desk. She\u2019s moving into unfazed about the whole Avenger thing. It\u2019s one of the reasons Foggy likes her- it is hard to faze Karen Page for long.\n\u201cSure is. Threats are how he expresses love.\u201d\n\u201cMild fondness,\u201d Steve corrects. Bucky nods seriously, lips barely twitching.\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate you.\u201d\n\u201cAwe, you\u2019ll make me blush.\u201d Foggy turns on the iPad and it bellows \u201cI\u2019M A BIRD MOTHERFUCKER.\u201d Foggy drops it in shock and Karen yelps. Steve and Bucky stare at it.\n\u201cI feel like,\u201d Foggy says carefully. \u201cClint may have gotten his hands on this.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like you may be correct.\u201d\nMatt comes into the office. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\u201cClint. Steve and Bucky are here.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Matt looks appropriately surprised. \u201cHello again.\u201d\n\u201cHi,\u201d Steve says. Bucky glowers. Foggy assumes this is because Bucky glowers at most people he\u2019s only just met that aren\u2019t small children. And Karen, but Karen\u2019ll do that to you.\n\u201cThey brought me another iPad after Bruce stepped on mine.\u201d\nMatt smiles pleasantly. \u201cYour fault for leaving it there within his Hulking range.\u201d\n\u201cWould not hold up in a court of law, counselor.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I could make it work.\u201d Matt angles his head towards Karen slightly. \u201cKaren, do you know where the folder for the Devon paperwork is?\u201d\n\u201cDesk, three steps to your right, just behind Foggy.\u201d\nMatt leans somewhat surprisingly close into Foggy\u2019s personal space, causing him to tense in surprise. He bends so he\u2019s breathing on Foggy\u2019s neck as he gropes around for the file. Karen pushes it towards him. \u201cAh, excellent.\u201d He leans back from Foggy. \u201cThank you, Karen.\u201d\nKaren raises her eyebrows. \u201cYou got it.\u201d\nMatt smiles weirdly flirtatiously at Foggy and heads back into his office. Foggy looks back at Steve and Bucky. Steve\u2019s face is oddly guarded and Bucky\u2019s glower has intensified.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Steve says vaguely. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Tony about how to turn off the bird thing.\u201d\nFoggy knows that Steve knows just as well as he does that if Tony didn\u2019t have anything to do with showing Clint how to do it, then he\u2019s still going to find it hilarious, and it\u2019s going to take some serious badgering to get him to tell him how to change it. \u201cPull out your All-American disappointed face, that should get the job done.\u201d\nSteve frowns. \u201cI don\u2019t have an All-American disappointed face.\u201d\n\u201cYou do,\u201d Bucky mutters. \u201cLooks like a bald eagle\u2019s about to cry.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see you around, Foggy. Bye, Karen.\u201d Steve gives them a little wave as they file out. Foggy and Karen look at each other.\n\u201cDo you feel like there\u2019s something going on that we aren\u2019t privy to but involved in?\u201d Karen asks. \u201cAnd it involves that asshole in the office and those assholes that just left?\u201d\nFoggy\u2019s a little pleased that she feels comfortable enough with the Avengers to call two decorated war heroes assholes. \u201cYes I do.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are the chances of getting that asshole to say what\u2019s up with the other assholes?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d Foggy raises his voice. \u201cHey, asshole!\u201d No response. Foggy shrugs. \u201cMinimal, I would guess.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat night when Foggy gets home, a rock\u2019s been thrown through his window. His place isn\u2019t even on the ground floor. He\u2019s kind of impressed. Also wondering how bad the hard times the Bulgarian mob have clearly fallen on are, if they\u2019ve resorted to rock throwing tactics.\nHe takes a picture and sends it to Karen with the message rock fairy visited!\nShe texts back ha, I got a brick. Clearly they like me more.\nShe then sends a picture of her posing with the brick, because this is their lives now.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHe gets a text the next night when he\u2019s watching an ABC Family Harry Potter marathon from Natasha.\n\nAll of us going to Italian place in Hell\u2019s Kitchen tomorrow night. You\u2019re coming alone.\n\nMatt climbs through the window, tugging off his helmet. \u201cYou don\u2019t even like the fifth movie.\u201d\n\u201cIt was on.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, silly me.\u201d Matt heads into his bedroom to change. \u201cAnything interesting happen while I was gone?\u201d\n\u201cABC Family\u2019s trying to do a kid friendly version of Dog Cops. I give it three episodes. Also I think I\u2019m being shanghaied into a date with the Avengers tomorrow night.\u201d\nMatt flops on the couch next to him in sweatpants and his Don\u2019t Mess With My Funky Flow sweater. \u201cSomehow I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\n\u201cGlad you\u2019re taking it so well.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I really should have seen it coming.\u201d\n\u201cYou really should have.\u201d\n\u201cI wish you all the happiness in the world.\u201d\n\u201cPlease wear something tasteful to our wedding.\u201d\nMatt nods thoughtfully. \u201cBuck naked. Got it.\u201d\nFoggy snorts as he absently throws an arm around Matt\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYour best man privileges are revoked.\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019m going to have to just bust in on a white horse to declare that I object, then?\u201d\n\u201cSounds like it would be pretty uncomfortable paired with the naked thing.\u201d\nMatt throws his head back and laughs and he looks so happy that Foggy just has to kiss him a little bit for it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHi, Serefina,\u201d Foggy says when he walks into Graziano\u2019s the next night. \u201cHow\u2019s your grandmother?\u201d They worked on the Graziano\u2019s case a few months ago, which involved an asshole landlord and a particularly heart wrenching closing argument to the jury, if he does say so himself.\nSerefina smiles at him. She is pretty and kind and according to Matt was extremely attracted to Foggy during the case.\n(Matt did not find Foggy\u2019s mock-wistful \u201cah, if only I\u2019d known\u201d comment as funny as Foggy did)\n(There may have been pillow throwing involved)\n\u201cHello, Foggy. We\u2019re all doing wonderfully, thank you. How are you and Karen and Matt?\u201d\n\u201cSplendid, thank you very much.\u201d Foggy sticks his hands in his pockets. \u201cThe party I\u2019m with is rather large tonight, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\nSerefina raises her eyebrows. \u201cIs it the Avengers?\u201d\n\u201cI am honestly surprised that you have a table big enough for all of them.\u201d\nShe grins. \u201cWe may have had to push a couple together.\u201d\n\u201cI find myself hoping you mean the tables.\u201d\nShe laughs. \u201cYou\u2019ll see them when you walk into the main room.\u201d\nHe does. Fortunately the place doesn\u2019t get extremely crowded on a Tuesday night, so there\u2019s not a lot of people to stare at the large crowd of superheroes sitting around two shoved together tables.\n\u201cI feel like this is an intervention,\u201d Foggy says, sitting in between Clint and Sam. \u201cWhat are you intervening me about?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the pasta like here?\u201d Tony\u2019s browsing the menu.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an Italian joint, Tony. It\u2019s pretty good.\u201d\n\u201cFoggy!\u201d\nFoggy turns around and grins. He welcomes the hug from Serefina\u2019s grandmother. \u201cHi, Mrs. Graziano. How\u2019s business?\u201d\n\u201cMuch better, thanks to you and Matthew. How is Matthew?\u201d\n\u201cVery well, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\u201cSuch a handsome young man. I hope his face is not as cut up now?\u201d\n\u201cNot the last time I checked.\u201d The last time Mrs. Graziano had seen him, Matt was in the courtroom after having a friendly chat with her landlord.\n\u201cGood, good. Anything you and your friends want, it\u2019s on the house.\u201d\nFoggy frowns. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so silly, of course it is.\u201d\n\u201cMrs. Graziano-\u201c\nShe leans on her cane and smiles benevolently. \u201cYou will not be the first person whose kneecaps I\u2019ve taken out with this cane, Foggy.\u201d\nSomehow, Foggy believes that. Tony snorts into his water.\n\u201cListen to her,\u201d Tony says. \u201cItalian grandmothers take no shit. I speak from experience. Lui dovrebbe saperlo ormai, non crede?\u201d\nMrs. Graziano laughs delightedly. \u201cI bambini, non imparano mai.\u201d She pats Tony on the cheek. \u201cTutto quello che vuoi, mio caro, per te \u00e8 gratis.\u201d\nShe hobbles off and Foggy looks at Tony. \u201cDid you just make her like you more than me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m very likable.\u201d\n\u201cSure you are.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off, Barton.\u201d\nFoggy sits back down. \u201cSo, intervention, what?\u201d\nSteve looks forwards seriously. Clearly he\u2019s been elected the spokesman for whatever\u2019s going down. Foggy tries not to feel apprehensive.\n\u201cWe wanted to know if you\u2019re happy,\u201d Steve says seriously.\n\u201cYeeeeeees? I feel like this is a trick question somehow.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a trick question. Just be honest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m happy. Probably happier than I\u2019ve ever been in my life. Why?\u201d Something occurs to him. \u201cOh Christ, you\u2019re not gonna go beat up Daredevil, are you? I will cut all communication with each and every one of you if you go and beat the shit out of him, I am not fucking around.\u201d He\u2019s not.\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t have any interest in Daredevil.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to beat him up,\u201d Clint says, raising his finger. \u201cBut that\u2019s not because of you. That\u2019s because he\u2019s a shit who thinks he\u2019s better at punching than I am.\u201d\n\u201cHe is better at punching than you are,\u201d Natasha points out in a murmur. Clint waves a hand.\n\u201cDetails.\u201d\n\u201cGuys,\u201d Sam reprimands. \u201cFocus. You\u2019re happy with Daredevil. Are you\u2026 happy at work?\u201d\nFoggy frowns. \u201cThis totally has to do with how twitchy you guys get when you\u2019re at the office, aren\u2019t you? Is this Matt\u2019s fault?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you automatically assume that it\u2019s Matt\u2019s fault?\u201d Bruce jumps in. Foggy\u2019s frown deepens.\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re being weird at Matt in particular. Did he like spit in your coffee or something? You know he wouldn\u2019t actually be able to tell it was your coffee, right?\u201d\n\u201cHe seems very\u2026\u201d Thor mulls for a moment. \u201cFriendly with you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve known him for ten years. If he wasn\u2019t friendly, I don\u2019t think I would have started a law firm or anything with him.\u201d\n\u201cUnusually friendly,\u201d Thor clarifies.\nFoggy looks at them for a moment before the brick of realization thwacks into him and he has to groan and put his face down on the table.\n\u201cI\u2019m not cheating on Daredevil with Matt.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re saying.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFoggy looks up at Steve. Searches his face. Groans even louder this time and puts his face back.\n\u201cMatt is not trying to steal me away from Daredevil.\u201d He hates his life.\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Bucky sounds like he has zero faith in Foggy. \u201cCause he seems very friendly with you.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Foggy says crankily. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d\nHe is not cranky because of the Avengers bringing it up. If it was just that, it would be hilarious. But it\u2019s not that.\nIt\u2019s that Matt\u2019s a shit.\nMatt knew about this. He totally knew about this. He must have heard them discussing it on their way out when they visited, that\u2019s why he looked so amused. That\u2019s why he got so in Foggy\u2019s space the other day. Matt thinks it\u2019s funny to wind them up.\n\nMatt is a shit and he goddamn well knows it.\n\n\u201cThere are sexual harassment suits,\u201d Bruce tells him gently. \u201cIf ever you feel you need them.\u201d\nWhat Foggy needs is to beat Matt about the head with Robert\u2019s Rules of Order, but he feels like that won\u2019t help Matt\u2019s case very much. \u201cThank you, Bruce,\u201d he says tiredly.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll leave you alone about it now,\u201d Sam says. \u201cYou\u2019re a grown ass man, you can deal with it on your own.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Sam.\u201d\n\u201cMaria Madre di Dio, Franklin.\u201d Foggy is treated to a thwack on the back of the head by Mrs. Graziano. \u201cHead off the table, this isn\u2019t a barn.\u201d\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMercifully, they do drop it after that. They actually have a nice meal that pretty well tamps down the irritation Foggy\u2019s feeling with Matt and he leaves laughing.\nUntil he hears a familiar scream from an alley and then he\u2019s fucking bolting towards it, ignoring the yells of everyone else.\nKaren is slamming one guy repeatedly in the face with a trash can lid while another guy is coming at her. Foggy does what seems like the most sensible thing at the time, which is jump on the guy\u2019s back and bellow \u201cGET THE FUCK AWAY FROM MY SECRETARY YOU DICKHOLE\u201d to confuse him. It does the trick enough that Karen pepper sprays the ever loving shit out of the dude. Foggy jumps off before the guy hits the ground.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Karen shakes the can of pepper spray, evidently empty. \u201cDamn.\u201d\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, fine. You?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Foggy peers down at the guy. \u201cI think you got some in his mouth, dude.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d She looks at the Avengers behind Foggy, staring at her in surprise. \u201cHey, guys.\u201d\nNatasha grins, pleased. \u201cI knew you were scary.\u201d\nKaren frowns at Foggy, momentarily diverted. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her I was scary?\u201d\n\u201cI told her you were scary! I told her you were very, very scary!\u201d\n\u201cGUYS.\u201d Tony is glaring at them. How is Tony the one to set them back on track? Foggy\u2019s life is so very weird. \u201cWhy are you being cornered by big guys in an alley?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time.\u201d Foggy crouches by the one Karen pepper sprayed into oblivion. \u201cYeah, there\u2019s definitely some in his mouth.\u201d\n\u201cWhy now? You guys are lawyers, you\u2019re not us, how are people coming after you?\u201d\n\u201cBelieve it or not, lawyers in crime ridden areas have been known to tick people off sometimes.\u201d Foggy squints. \u201cBulgarian mafia?\u201d\n\u201cBulgarian mafia,\u201d Karen confirms. \u201cList of things we don\u2019t tell Matt?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he would be displeased to hear you have that,\u201d a low voice says from behind them. The Avengers jump. Foggy yells and falls from a crouch properly onto the ground. Karen hurls her empty pepper spray canister in the voice\u2019s direction.\nMatt just lets it bounce off his helmet.\n\u201cThis is not the best time to try and scare us to death,\u201d Karen snaps.\n\u201cAre you both all right?\u201d Matt asks.\n\u201cFine.\u201d Foggy holds his arm out. \u201cDo your boyfriendly duties and help me up.\u201d\nMatt\u2019s lips twitch and he grasps Foggy, hauling him to his feet. His fingers linger on his wrist, checking his pulse, probably. \u201cYou all right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Been a while since I had to jump on anybody\u2019s back.\u201d\nMatt nods and quietly brushes his lips against Foggy\u2019s. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\u201cGross,\u201d says Clint.\n\u201cI have to deal with this all the time,\u201d Karen tells him. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to say gross. I get to say gross.\u201d\nMatt turns to Karen and makes a vague gesture at the thugs on the ground. \u201cWho are these?\u201d\n\u201cWho, them?\u201d She winces a little as Matt inclines his head.\n\u201cYes. Them.\u201d\nShe looks over Matt\u2019s shoulder pleadingly at Foggy. Foggy sighs and nods wearily.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, cat\u2019s out of the bag now.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2026 might possibly be members of the Bulgarian mafia.\u201d\nMatt goes very still. \u201cThe Bulgarian mafia.\u201d\n\u201cThem.\u201d\nMatt now looks at Foggy. Foggy lifts his chin in his best \u201cfight me, Murdock\u201d stance. \u201cThe Andriev case?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not super thrilled with us,\u201d he confirms.\n\u201cYour partner hasn\u2019t gotten any threats.\u201d\nFoggy shrugs. \u201cMight\u2019ve thought the blind guy wouldn\u2019t notice a rock through his window.\u201d\nMatt\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m very overprotective and focusing all that energy quite unfairly on Foggy and Karen\u201d vibe gets stronger. \u201cThey threw rocks through your windows?\u201d\n\u201cKaren got a brick. I\u2019m actually a little offended.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Thor asks, stepping forwards. Foggy immediately starts shaking his head as Matt arches like a pissed cat.\n\u201cNo, no, no. I do not want you guys getting involved in this. I didn\u2019t want him getting involved in this.\u201d Foggy jerks a thumb at Matt.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you want me getting involved?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I like it when you come home generally less bruised and beat to shit, is why!\u201d\n\u201cWe can get involved,\u201d Steve says, all the Avengers shuffling a little closer.\n\u201cMy place is home?\u201d Matt asks, sounding startled.\nFoggy takes a deep breath and launches in.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you guys getting involved because this isn\u2019t an Avengers thing, this is a Hell\u2019s Kitchen standard lawyer everyday life thing.\u201d Foggy turns to Matt. \u201cShut up.\u201d Foggy turns back to the Avengers. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something to worry about, it\u2019s fairly standard stuff.\u201d Back to Matt. \u201cYes it is standard stuff and yes we will tell you about it.\u201d Back to the Avengers. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go back to his place so we can calm him down from the fact that he is now freaking out about that this being something we\u2019ve gone up against before. He doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s freaking out, but he is.\u201d Back to Matt. \u201cYes you can follow us.\u201d Back again. \u201cNo you cannot.\u201d To Karen this time. \u201cDid I cover everything? I think that covered everything.\u201d\n\u201cSounded good to me.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about this later,\u201d Bucky mutters. Foggy waves at him.\n\u201cLater. When I\u2019ve had a couple beers and some sleep and he\u2019s not hyperventilating on me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not hyperventilating,\u201d Matt mutters.\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\u201cYou can handle this?\u201d Sam asks. Matt frowns and shuffles.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Tony says. \u201cYou met his partner, right? Murdock?\u201d\nMatt tilts his head a little. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cKeep an eye on him. He\u2019s shifty. We don\u2019t trust him.\u201d\nFoggy suppresses a groan.\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d Matt says seriously. Karen mouths \u201cwhat the fuck?\u201d at Foggy, who mouths back \u201ctell you later\u201d.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Clint claps him on the shoulder. \u201cGlad both of you guys haven\u2019t been roughed up by ruffians.\u201d\n\u201cText me when you get home,\u201d Bruce says.\n\u201cYou got it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs he gonna kill us?\u201d Karen asks in the elevator on the way up.\n\u201cNo. Well, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d They step out of the elevator. \u201cHe\u2019d know where to hide the bodies, though.\u201d\nFoggy opens the door to Matt\u2019s apartment to see Matt standing by the window, helmet off but still in the suit, glowering.\nFoggy and Karen just stand in the doorway for a moment. Then Foggy closes the door behind him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re really hard to take seriously when your hair\u2019s all funky from the mask,\u201d Karen tells him while Foggy goes to the fridge.\n\u201cI know, right? All flat and shit.\u201d Foggy pulls out two beers.\n\u201cDoes it ever not look flat?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you gotta tug it off right. Takes practice.\u201d\nKaren wrinkles her nose as Foggy hands her one of the beers. \u201cDude.\u201d\n\u201cHey, you started asking questions.\u201d\n\u201cSo,\u201d Matt says flatly, running his fingers through his hair. It looks much wilder and much more distracting. \u201cTell me about this list of yours.\u201d\nFoggy and Karen look at each other.\n\u201cLike, everything on it?\u201d Karen asks cautiously. \u201cOr the Bulgarian mob thing?\u201d\n\u201cStart where you think is best.\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d Foggy sighs. \u201cHonestly, most of it isn\u2019t stuff like mobs and mafias and shit.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Karen agrees. \u201cMost of the stuff is just like yes Foggy did accidentally order rainbow socks for you instead of the black ones, but he thought you looked cute in them, so he just threw them in with your regular ones.\u201d\n\u201cHe knew that, actually,\u201d Foggy interjects. \u201cThey felt different. He just liked making me happy when I saw them.\u201d\nKaren stares at Foggy. \u201cYou\u2019re both disgusting. I want a raise. Anyway. There\u2019s not actually a lot of scary things. There\u2019s occasional threats, but mostly it\u2019s just weird things like that.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about the Bulgarian mob.\u201d\n\u201cThey sent us a note, about a week ago. Then the brick and the rock. And then they wanted to rough me up a little.\u201d Karen looks at Foggy. \u201cSmall, blond woman. Probably thought they could just hit me in the face a few times and I\u2019d show up to work with bruises and crying and that\u2019d be enough.\u201d\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t count on how frightening you are.\u201d\nKaren smiles proudly. \u201cYou bet they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\nFoggy sighs. \u201cMatt, do you remember the last case we told you had someone threatening the firm?\u201d\nMatt frowns, clearly thinking back on it. \u201cThe White case.\u201d\n\u201cYou came back with one broken rib and three bruised ones. You were white knuckling your cane in court the next day.\u201d\n\u201cWe need you safe, Matt,\u201d Karen says softly.\nMatt shakes his head. \u201cYou both would manage fine without me, the firm would make it and you two would be-\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the-\u201c Karen looks at Foggy for help.\n\u201cKaren needs you safe, Matt. Karen is your friend, and she wants and needs you in one piece.\u201d Foggy rubs his forehead. \u201cI need you safe,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cI need you alive and okay and not getting beat to shit because you feel the need to protect us from what we can handle on our own.\u201d\nFoggy doesn\u2019t look up at Matt as the silence hangs heavy.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Matt finally says.\n\u201cOkay okay?\u201d Karen asks. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to wig out?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Karen slumps on the couch and kicks off her heels. Matt sits across from Foggy on the coffee table and Foggy finally looks up at him. Matt has that slightly twisty smile he gets when he\u2019s having good feelings but doesn\u2019t understand what to do with them.\n\u201cHome?\u201d he asks. Foggy shakes his head.\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get to pull that adorably happy thing.\u201d He pokes Matt in the nose. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking with the Avengers.\u201d\nMatt\u2019s soft emotional smile widens into something Foggy\u2019s more familiar with: ah ha yes I am a little shit but nobody ever expects the blind guy. \u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, why are the Avengers saying that lawyer-you is shifty?\u201d Karen takes another swig of her beer.\n\u201cThey think Matt\u2019s trying to steal me from Daredevil.\u201d\nKaren does a spit take right on the back of Matt\u2019s suit.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Matt objects mildly, still grinning.\n\u201cAre you shitting me?\u201d\n\u201cThey met me tonight to let me know I could file a sexual harassment suit if I felt the need.\u201d\nMatt cackles. Karen groans.\n\u201cI\u2019m taking the bed because you have silk sheets. Please don\u2019t fuck on the couch. Or at least loudly.\u201d\nKaren staggers off, heels in hand, clearly done with both of them.\n\u201cYou are constantly such a shit,\u201d Foggy tells Matt. \u201cThey think that you\u2019re trying to seduce me in the workplace.\u201d\n\u201cI mean. They\u2019re not wrong.\u201d\n\u201cMatthew.\u201d\nMatt grins. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, though, isn\u2019t it? A little bit?\u201d\nFoggy suppresses a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not that funny.\u201d\nMatt slides a hand into Foggy\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them eventually. I just. I want to keep the lines drawn between all of this and you.\u201d\nMatt\u2019s got that sad puppy thing going on again. Foggy relents a little. \u201cYou better. I don\u2019t want to have any more interventions.\u201d\nMatt leans his face into the crook of Foggy\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t hurt,\u201d he says. Foggy puts a hand in his hair.\n\u201cYeah. Me too. So, wanna fuck on the couch?\u201d\nMatt laughs so hard his entire body shakes with it.\n\u00a0\nIn the morning they reach an arrangement. Matt will investigate into the folks throwing blunt objects at them. He will not punch them into oblivion. He will take a calm and measured approach.\n\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll last?\u201d Karen asks while she\u2019s sorting through papers on her desk.\n\u201cAs long as Matt says it will,\u201d Foggy answers calmly. Matt\u2019s made him a promise. He\u2019s going to stick to it.\nMatt sidles in with what smells like donuts from Evangeline\u2019s, the bakery up the street and the actual best pastry eatery in the world. Foggy thinks about kissing him, but the level to which Foggy wishes to kiss him may actually add Karen to the list of blind people working in this office, so he just kisses him on the cheek.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo Daredevil wanted us to dump this here,\u201d Clint says, dropping a file on Karen\u2019s desk. Foggy looks over from the kitchenette. \u201cIs he ever going to get over this \u2018I have a secret identity cause I think it makes me badass\u2019 thing? Does that ever come up in your pillow talk?\u201d\n\u201cMostly it\u2019s just \u2018these are how many old ladies I helped cross the street while punching ninjas in the face\u2019 counts, honestly.\u201d Foggy companionably bumps shoulder with Natasha and gives Karen her coffee. \u201cGets really boring after a while. Kind of wish he\u2019d just give me nice recipes for Swedish meatballs eventually or something.\u201d\nKaren snorts as Matt wanders in, face amicable.\n\u201cI heard voices.\u201d\n\u201cClint and Nat are dropping something off,\u201d Foggy says, picking up the considerably thick file. \u201cDon\u2019t know what, though.\u201d\nNatasha seems to be giving Matt her chilling \u201cI have gutted warlords with the handles of mugs\u201d glare in the hopes he\u2019ll somehow register it. Clint is sticking his tongue out at Matt.\n\u201cHello, Clint, Natasha.\u201d Matt\u2019s voice is serene. \u201cNice for you to drop by again.\u201d\nFoggy frowns as he flips through the contents. \u201cIs this- did Daredevil ask for a dossier on the Bulgarian mob?\u201d\n\u201cHe did,\u201d Clint says loudly. \u201cAsked us to drop it off right here. Guess he knows where you guys work.\u201d\nKaren bites her lip to hide the smile. Foggy raises his eyebrows at Clint and resists the temptation to say \u201che\u2019s blind, not deaf\u201d at him but feels like that\u2019ll probably exacerbate the situation.\n\u201cIs it because the Bulgarian mob\u2019s been harassing you guys?\u201d Matt smiles angelically in the realm of Clint and Natasha. \u201cDaredevil stopped by to let me know.\u201d\n\u201cHave you seen his muscles?\u201d Clint hollers. \u201cVery big. Powerful. Seen him punch a guy right in the face like he was punching tissue paper.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t exactly see them, no,\u201d Matt answers serenely. Foggy takes a deep breath.\n\u201cDaredevil asked for a dossier on the Bulgarian mob?\u201d he repeats while Clint clearly tries to right himself from that one.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Natasha answers. \u201cHe wants information to help dismantling them with less punching than normal.\u201d She smirks at Foggy a little. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to worry you two.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d Foggy\u2019s pleased. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\u201cHe likes Foggy a lot,\u201d Clint bellows. \u201cMakes him really happy. Sure hate to think what he\u2019d do if he found out someone was trying to get in Foggy\u2019s pants when this someone would know that Foggy was happy with Daredevil.\u201d\nFoggy stares at Clint and wonders how this man is a covert operative. Natasha looks like she is contemplating the same thing.\n\u201cProbably wouldn\u2019t be very pleasant,\u201d Matt agrees. He leans over to grab Foggy\u2019s mug of coffee from the desk but his cane accidentally hits Foggy\u2019s foot and goes down.\n\u201cI got it.\u201d Foggy kneels down to pick it up. \u201cHang on.\u201d He grasps vaguely for something to hold onto to help himself back up, and he ends up settling on the corner of Karen\u2019s desk and Matt\u2019s belt loops, almost absentmindedly feeling up Matt\u2019s ass on the way. Matt lets out an odd strangled sound that\u2019s not quite high pitched enough for a yelp but certainly not low pitched enough to be a growl. Foggy hands Matt\u2019s cane to him with a sunny smile.\n\u201cHere you go, buddy,\u201d he says cheerfully, because fuck you, Matt, he can play this game too, and he can play it better.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Matt mutters, voice still awkwardly hoarse. Foggy is so god damn proud of himself he could shed a tear, honestly. He slips back into his office. Foggy turns to Clint and Natasha. Clint looks confused and Natasha contemplative.\n\u201cThanks for the file,\u201d Foggy says cheerily.\n\u201cYou\u2019rrrrrrrrrre welcome,\u201d Clint answers slowly. \u201cThere\u2019s something going on here and I\u2019m gonna figure out what it is.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck with that, Hawkguy.\u201d\nClint slowly moves out of the office, looking warily at Foggy the whole time. Natasha raises an eyebrow at Foggy with a smile.\n\u201cThis is somehow a game with Daredevil,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it is, but it is.\u201d\nFoggy grins. \u201cMight be.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s winning?\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d Foggy answers immediately. \u201cAs I win at all things.\u201d\nNatasha snorts. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll check in with Daredevil and see if he says the same thing.\u201d\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t he\u2019s lying.\u201d\nShe smirks a little and gives Karen a wave. \u201cSee you, Karen.\u201d\n\u201cBye, Natasha.\u201d\nNatasha closes the door behind her and Karen immediately turns to Foggy.\n\u201cNot paid enough,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I\u2019m not getting a raise, I want my name on the door. Bigger than both of yours.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll swap it out with Matt\u2019s,\u201d Foggy assures her, then turns to call out. \u201cThat okay with you, Matt?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m too busy looking at recipes for Swedish meatballs to hear you, Franklin!\u201d Matt calls back. Foggy laughs. Karen starts throwing pens at him.\n\u00a0\nSo Foggy is starting to think that perhaps his decision to not let Matt beat the shit out of the Bulgarian mob may have been a poor choice on his part.\nThis is due mostly to the fact that there are two rather large gentlemen tailing him on his way back from Murphy\u2019s.\nHe casually pulls out his phone and hits Karen\u2019s number.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk, no time, just listen. I\u2019ve just left Murphy\u2019s and I\u2019ve got two big dudes on my tail. Call Emergency Contact #1 and if you can\u2019t get ahold of him, call Emergency Contact #2.\u201d He hesitates for a second. \u201cAnd tell Contact #1 that-\u201c\nThis is of course the moment Foggy gets whacked across the back of the head, because his life is a soap opera.\n\u00a0\nHe also gets waken because he\u2019s being hit, to the front of the head this time.\n\u201cNyuh,\u201d he manages intelligently through a bloody lip, and cracks open his eyes.\nThe two big guys from before are flanking a tall skinny man who is kneeling in front of Foggy and appears to be the person who hit him. Foggy squints at him.\n\u201cM\u2019I actually tied to a chair in a warehouse?\u201d he croaks. He looks around a little. Might also be a parking garage but it\u2019s pretty dark. \u201cPretty clich\u00e9, guys.\u201d\nThe skinny man smiles. \u201cYou know the Avengers,\u201d he says in barely accented English. \u201cMy friends here told me.\u201d\nFoggy squints a little harder and hey yeah, these dicks do look familiar.\n\u201cYour mouth still taste like pepper spray?\u201d The one he was talking to punches him in the face. \u201cGraaaaaa that sucked.\u201d\nSkinny Asshole leans back on his haunches a little. \u201cHow does a small time lawyer from Hell\u2019s Kitchens become friends with the Avengers?\u201d\n\u201cScuse you. I\u2019m big time.\u201d\nSkinny Asshole chuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s of no matter, of course. I was just curious. Now.\u201d He inclines his head slightly. \u201cI\u2019d like you to drop the Andriev case.\u201d\n\u201cGot that vibe.\u201d Foggy spits out some blood on the guy\u2019s nice black pants. \u201cGonna have to pass.\u201d\nSkinny Asshole calmly wipes the blood off with a tissue. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard my offer yet.\u201d\n\u201cIf it involves money, m\u2019not interested. Probably actually involves you hurting me. Still no.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, people always say they won\u2019t break under torture.\u201d Skinny Asshole stands up and steps back. \u201cThey\u2019re usually wrong.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like fun.\u201d Foggy looks up at the guy through the black eye he suspects is forming. \u201cAm I a warning? Or a message?\u201d\nHis smile widens. \u201cThat depends on when you break.\u201d\n\u201cYay.\u201d\nOne of the big guys punches him right in the gut. He thinks he feels a rib crack. He can\u2019t help a little scream at that. Skinny Asshole folds his arms.\n\u201cI wonder what the pretty secretary will think when she sees you,\u201d he muses. \u201cIf she will even recognize you.\u201d\nThe other big guy slams his fist into his face at the same time the first one punches him in the chest with his other fist. Foggy definitely hears his nose break.\n\u201cPerhaps it is good that your partner is blind.\u201d Skinny Asshole\u2019s lips twist. \u201cHopefully your secretary will keep him from feeling your face.\u201d\nFoggy\u2019s chair falls over with a thump. Yep, something is definitely wrong with his ribs. He only has the breath right now to choke.\n\u201cBe careful,\u201d Skinny Asshole instructs. \u201cI want him to be able to tell me when he gives in.\u201d\nFoggy manages to raise a middle finger that promptly gets stamped on. Agh.\n\u201cSass is not appreciated,\u201d Skinny Asshole lectures. Foggy cracks open his eyes in time to see the wall behind him get smashed in by a large green blur.\n\u201cOh good,\u201d Foggy mumbles, and closes his eyes while listening to the carnage, letting his head slump against the floor. He deserves it.\nHe is what he considers rudely tugged back to personhood again what may be a few minutes later by Natasha, tapping his cheek.\n\u201cWake up, khrabryy mal'chik,\u201d she says softly. \u201cThe fight\u2019s over.\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019allowed to be crabby,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cOr was that Russian?\u201d\nShe laughs a little. \u201cOpen your eyes, Foggy.\u201d\nFoggy blearily obeys her. All the Avengers are crowded around Natasha, in various states of panic. The Hulk is a great green shadow, looming over each of them.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t all have to come,\u201d he reproaches. \u201cWas just three dudes.\u201d\n\u201cWe wanted to,\u201d Bucky growls menacingly. Foggy squints a little.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not smears on the floor, right?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d Tony lands next to Steve, who\u2019s got his jaw clenched tight. \u201cThey just wish they were.\u201d\n\u201cOh good.\u201d Having his eyes open hurts. He tries closing them but that hurts too. He just can\u2019t win. \u201cEmergency contact #1 didn\u2019t answer his phone then?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I imagine he heard Bruce knock down that wall and is on his way as fast as his horns can carry him.\u201d Natasha gently tries to shift Foggy and he whimpers. \u201cWhat hurts, Foggy?\u201d\n\u201cEverything a valid answer?\u201d He coughs and his lips are wet. Gross.\n\u201cNot particularly helpful.\u201d\n\u201cBummer.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get him out of here,\u201d Sam says urgently. \u201cCan-\u201c\n\u201cShit.\u201d\nFoggy hears it cut through the room and can\u2019t help a little grin. His teeth are probably bloody. Maybe not a great idea. \u201cHey, buddy.\u201d\nA red blur cuts his way quickly through the Avenger to kneel by Foggy. Matt takes Foggy\u2019s face in his hands and Foggy can\u2019t help a little hiss of pain.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Matt whispers. \u201cSorry, sorry, sorry, I\u2019m so sorry, Foggy, I\u2019m so sorry-\u201c Matt very gently leans his forehead against Foggy\u2019s. The cool of the helmet is nice.\n\u201cQuit \u2018pologizing. S\u2019not your fault.\u201d Foggy kind of wants to reach up and put his hand on Matt\u2019s cheek but also that sounds like it would kind of hurt.\nMatt doesn\u2019t answer, just carefully presses his lips to Foggy\u2019s. It\u2019s the first time Foggy has ever been sad kissing Matt. He disapproves.\n\u201cGonna be okay, buddy. M\u2019gonna pass out now, though, if that\u2019s cool.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not conscious enough to know if it is cool or not.\n\u00a0\nWhen Foggy wakes up, his body aches. Matt\u2019s curled into his front like a tiny sweatpantted kitten, asleep. So it kind of balances out, he guesses.\nHe closes his eyes and tries to go back to sleep so as not to disturb the peace, but to no avail. Matt, who must have woken up to his heartbeat or something, stirs sleepily and mumbles \u201cFoggy?\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d\nMatt straightens, reaches over to his nightstand, and hands Foggy a glass of water with a straw, holding the glass steady while Foggy drinks. When the entire glass is gone, Matt puts the glass back and lies back down facing Foggy.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. This isn\u2019t a Daredevil thing. This is a Nelson &amp; Murdock thing.\u201d\n\u201cPartially my fault.\u201d\nFoggy groans and trembling raises an arm. He bats at Matt with a hand that appears to be heavily bandaged. \u201cM\u2019supposed to be hitting you pretty hard,\u201d he tells Matt. \u201cWhen I have my strength back, I will give you a walloping like you would not believe.\u201d\nMatt grins a little weakly. \u201cIs that code for something?\u201d\nFoggy groans again. \u201cYou can go back to apologizing now.\u201d He looks around. \u201cWhy am I in your bed and not a hospital?\u201d\n\u201cMy apartment was closer and, well.\u201d He goes a little red. \u201cI may have thrown a slight fit at moving you too far.\u201d\nFoggy snorts. \u201cSlight.\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\nFoggy looks back at his hand. It looks very well bandaged. \u201cClaire?\u201d\n\u201cClaire.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d Foggy looks back at Matt. \u201cWhere\u2019d the Avengers go?\u201d\n\u201cClaire badgered them into leaving while I slept and she said she\u2019d call them if there was any change.\u201d\n\u201cMm, good, they should get some sleep.\u201d Something occurs to Foggy. \u201cWait, they were here?\u201d\n\u201cThor carried you.\u201d\n\u201cBack to your place?\u201d Foggy frowns. \u201cI thought you wanted to keep personal life and Daredevil separate. Aren\u2019t you worried they\u2019ll find out?\u201d\nMatt shrugs as best he can lying down. \u201cWell.\u201d\n\u201cWell what?\u201d\n\u201cIt was you.\u201d\nFoggy stares at Matt, whose lips are tight in the way they get when he\u2019s feeling emotional.\nFoggy shuffles a little closer to Matt and presses his face into his shoulder.\n\u201cWas going to tell Karen to tell you I love you, before those assholes beaned me,\u201d he says through Matt\u2019s sweatshirt. Matt stiffens, then relaxes.\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t have to say it back or anything. You\u2019re all weird and Matt about feelings.\u201d Foggy yawns. \u201cJust wanted you to know.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I.\u201d Matt leans his head into Foggy\u2019s a little. \u201cI love you too.\u201d\nFoggy smiles sleepily. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t get kidnapped anymore.\u201d\nHe yawns again. \u201cWell, there go my plans for Saturday night.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t joke.\u201d\n\u201cI think these meds Claire gave me are super awesome.\u201d\nMatt\u2019s snort ruffles Foggy\u2019s hair. \u201cThey are.\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019taking another nap. You are also napping cause sleep is good.\u201d\nFoggy can feel Matt\u2019s smile as Matt puts his hand on the back of his neck. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA few hours later, Foggy is upright in Matt\u2019s living room and watching Law &amp; Order so he can yell at the judge to quit allowing things. Claire left half an hour ago, telling Foggy he would be fine if he stopped moving, no sex for a week, Franklin, keep drinking water, call if anything changes. Matt\u2019s in his room changing the sheets on their bed to get rid of some of the blood on them. Karen\u2019s sitting next to him on the couch watching with him.\n\u201cIf judges were this agreeable in real life, our jobs would be so much easier,\u201d Foggy tells Karen. Karen pats the shoulder without bandages.\n\u201cYou bet, dear.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a knock on the door that sounds more like a bang.\n\u201cNelson!\u201d Tony hollers. \u201cOpen up! We have alcohol and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s.\u201d\nFoggy looks at Karen soulfully. \u201cWill you open the door, sweet Karen, as I am couchridden?\u201d\nKaren rolls her eyes, but opens the door. The Avengers tumble in.\n\u201cFoggy!\u201d Thor looks pleased. \u201cYou are conscious!\u201d\n\u201cI am. This is true.\u201d\nClint flops on the floor across from the couch. \u201cSo this is Daredevil\u2019s place, huh? Pretty sparse. Kind of like a prison.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is where I\u2019ll be sending you if get beat up again,\u201d Bucky says flatly.\nKaren looks at Foggy. \u201cThe threats equal love thing?\u201d\n\u201cMm-hm.\u201d\n\u201cOh good.\u201d Karen stretches out. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have to kick his ass.\u201d\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nKaren cracks an eye at Bucky. \u201cTry me, dude. See how that goes.\u201d\nBucky edges away a little.\n\u201cShe\u2019ll do it,\u201d Matt says from where he\u2019s leaning against the doorway. \u201cShe\u2019s a very scary lady.\u201d\nThe Avengers look all either startled or miffed.\n\u201cThe fuck you doing here, Murdock?\u201d Tony asks. Bruce nods in quiet assent. Natasha looks like she might be starting to put things together.\n\u201cI\u2019m very familiar with the layout of the apartment. I wanted to be sure I was before I bought the place.\u201d He sniffs. \u201cIs that cookie dough ice cream?\u201d\nKaren chucks him the carton and he catches it neatly, smiling satisfactorily. He sits next to Foggy, cracking open the pint.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even have a spoon, what are you going to-\u201c Matt promptly digs out a chunk of ice cream with his fingers. \u201cAw, dude, come on. Doesn\u2019t food from your fingers taste worse cause you can taste everything on them from before?\u201d\n\u201cI washed them very thoroughly beforehand. Want some?\u201d\n\u201cI will not become that fucking awful couple that lets the other person feed them from their fingers.\u201d\n\u201cYou are that fucking awful couple,\u201d Karen mutters. \u201cTo resist it is useless, it is useless to resist it.\u201d\n\u00a0Everyone is staring at them.\n\u201cYou,\u201d Tony says loudly. \u201cMotherfuckers.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m actually kind of impressed,\u201d Natasha muses. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to keep secrets from me.\u201d\n\u201cYOU LET ME TELL THIS GUY TO HIS FACE THAT HE WAS GOING TO BEAT HIMSELF UP,\u201d Clint yells. \u201cYOU LIVE TO TORMENT ME.\u201d\n\u201cI am glad you are not attempting to steal Foggy away from his beloved,\u201d Thor tells Matt. Foggy goes a little pink as Matt grins.\n\u201cThank you, Thor.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re all assholes,\u201d Sam says flatly. \u201cGive me that beer.\u201d\n\u201cSeconded.\u201d Bucky reaches forwards and grabs a beer.\n\u201cI\u2019m a little confused,\u201d Steve puts in.\n\u201cJoin the club, Spangles. What the hell, Murdock?\u201d\n\u201cHow does it work?\u201d Bruce murmurs. \u201cI\u2019m curious.\u201d\n\u201cI can explain it later. Right now I\u2019m very comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cI DREW YOU ASIDE AND TOLD HIM TO GO BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF YOU,\u201d Clint bellows. \u201cI TOLD YOU THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU WERE BLIND DIDN\u2019T MEAN YOU\u2019RE NOT AN ASSHOLE.\u201d\n\u201cVery true,\u201d Foggy agrees. Matt pokes his cheek with a sticky finger that smells like vanilla.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very unkind way to refer to your beloved.\u201d\n\u201cEat me, Murdock.\u201d But Foggy\u2019s still grinning at Matt, and Matt must know because he grins widely back.\n\u201cOH CHRIST. VOCIFEROUS.\u201d\n\u201cFor the love of God, Clint, shut up, some of us were beat up in an abandoned warehouse not too long ago.\u201d"
