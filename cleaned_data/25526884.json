    "text": "Ursa stops withdrawing from her daughter after her daughter pushes her son out of a tree. It\u2019s perhaps not the expected response, especially when she was already wary of her daughter\u2019s tendencies. But it\u2019s the result of an epiphany.\u00a0\nThe epiphany is this: this is partly Ursa\u2019s fault.\u00a0\nShe takes a good, hard look at her daughter\u2019s life. Azula showed her sparks practically upon birth, and has been favoured by Ozai ever since. Ursa turned her attention to Zuko, because Zuko was more like Ursa and he needed the love, but\u2026 but Azula needs a mother\u2019s love, too, even if she has her father\u2019s approval. (Though she doesn\u2019t have his love. Not really. Ursa isn\u2019t convinced that Ozai is capable of that, which makes her concerned that Azula might not be capable, either.)\nThe children used to spend time together. But since Zuko has started showing that he is also a bender, just a late bloomer, Azula has turned the cruelty she\u2019s learned from Ozai onto her brother.\u00a0\nWell, Ursa thinks. She has a lot to make up for as a mother.\nShe tries to talk to Azula about the tree incident, but Azula insists that it was an accident, and that it isn\u2019t her fault that Zuzu has naturally bad balance.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not an ideal response by any stretch of the imagination, but it prompts Ursa to shift  her  balance. She doesn\u2019t spend less time with Zuko, who needs her, but she starts spending more time with Azula, too. She teaches Azula how to braid her hair, a style that is distinctly not Fire Nation, because the idea of using a private hairstyle as a form of rebellion makes Azula snicker. She invites Azula to sit with Zuko when she tells the stories of the Fire Nation\u2019s greatest plays. And while Azula always rolls her eyes, while she seems to root for the villain in every story, she also stays and listens.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s slow progress. It\u2019s so very slow, especially with Zuko\u2019s flames being called up more and more easily. But Ursa can see the change happening.\u00a0\nWithin a year, Azula seeks out her brother without a plan to terrorise him. Within two, when Azula gets into a surprisingly (worryingly) violent clash with a visiting dignitary\u2019s son, Zuko quietly tells Ursa that it was because the boy made fun of him. Ursa gently brings this up with Azula, and her daughter glares and claims that only  she  is allowed to make fun of Zuzu, which is\u2026 not perfect, but it\u2019s progress.\nAnd so Ursa finds herself in a battle of sorts with her husband. Ozai tries to tear the two of them apart, tries to make Azula stronger by giving her an enemy, tries to make Zuko weaker by placing him as the second best. Ursa tries to undo the damage, all through sessions of gossiping by the turtleducks, through story time in a shared bed that Azula claims she\u2019s too tired to leave, through ganging up on Zuko with his sister until he lets the pair of them tie messy braids into his hair.\u00a0\nAzula isn\u2019t\u2026 she isn\u2019t normal. She\u2019s too much her father\u2019s daughter. And she still clearly sees Zuko as a potential threat to her favour with Ozai, but it gets better, because Ursa slowly impresses upon her that they will never need to compete for  her  love.\nThen Azulon forces her hand, and Ursa can stay no longer. She hurries to Zuko\u2019s rooms, hoping that Azula has fallen asleep there again so that she doesn\u2019t need to make two trips--\u00a0\nOnly to find them both there, packing haphazardly. They look up at her and freeze.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ursa asks, breathless and perplexed.\u00a0\nAzula\u2019s face is stonier than any nine-year-old child\u2019s should be. \u201cI heard,\u201d she states. \u201cHe  said that Father has to lose his firstborn child. Well, then, he\u2019s losing both of us.\u201d She holds her head high, glaring at Ursa.\u00a0\n(And to think that Ursa had questioned Azula\u2019s ability to love. Azula\u2019s love is strange and sideways, but here she is: the favoured princess, ready to toss her life to one side for her brother's safety.)\nUrsa looks to Zuko, who seems frightened and harried, but also like it hasn\u2019t occurred to him to question Azula\u2019s account.\u00a0\n(Ursa manages to be both glad for this, and also worried that his loyalty to Azula might backfire on him someday.)\n\u201cOh, my children,\u201d Ursa says, kneeling and opening her arms. \u201cIt will be fine. Zuko will be fine. I\u2019ve\u2026 I\u2019ve taken care of it.\u201d Zuko comes to her easily. Azula waits at a distance, scowling, but follows once Zuko beckons her. \u201cThank you for taking care of your brother, Azula. You\u2019re both going to need to take care of each other once I\u2019m gone.\u201d\nHer children pull back, alarmed. \u201cOnce you\u2019re gone? Where are you going?\u201d Zuko asks, tears in his voice.\u00a0\nUrsa presses a kiss to his temple, and then to his sister\u2019s.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going away so that you don\u2019t have to,\u201d she explains. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I love you. I\u2019ll always love you. Both of you. Completely, and with my whole heart.\u201d\u00a0\nUrsa leaves her children behind. She hopes that they will be more loyal to one another than to the new Fire Lord. She hopes that they will both survive the reign of their father.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Father grasps Zuko\u2019s hair in one fist and calls fire to the other, Azula looks away.\u00a0\nZuzu writes to her every month for three years.\u00a0\nIt would be quite impressive, if Azula was inclined to be impressed by other people. Zuko never gives up hunting for a myth, and he never stops writing, even though Azula hasn\u2019t replied to a single letter.\u00a0\n(This isn\u2019t precisely true. Azula reads every letter and pens a response, and then burns them both. Who knows who is reading her correspondence, after all. She won\u2019t be seen as weak, by her father or the servants or anyone else.\nBut she still does the writing, while she\u2019s alone. She writes things like  I wonder if you swear like a sailor now  and  I never saw you after the burning, so I don\u2019t even know how to picture you  and  how is your firebending training with Uncle going, I've surpassed all of my teachers and  don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice that you mentioned asking about the Avatar rumours in \u2018massage parlours\u2019, brother - I do know what \u2018massage parlours' are.\nShe writes them, and burns them before the ink is even dry.)\nAzula is the perfect Fire Princess. She knows what the punishment is for imperfection, and it won\u2019t happen to her. And if she reads those letters when they arrive, if breathes a little easier because they are hard proof that Zuko is still whole, if she writes her own responses like a child with a penpal\u2026 nobody else will ever know.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBack when things had been simpler, Azula and Zuko had crafted codes.\u00a0\nThey were stupid codes, born of being royal children who were never allowed to say what they wanted unless they were in private, but they were also helpful. They were twists of language that nobody else would understand that would make a \u2018yes\u2019 sound like a \u2018no\u2019 to the other. They were the slightest facial movements (an eyebrow twitched upwards for  is that true  or  are you okay; one blink for \u2018yes\u2019, two for \u2018no\u2019). Hair-touching meant  get me out of this situation  and a stretching roll of a wrist or an ankle said  wait for your cue.(Zuko hadn\u2019t communicated anything to her before the Agni Kai. Not even when he was burning. Azula doesn\u2019t know whether or not she would have done anything, had Zuko touched his hair. She\u2019s glad that she doesn\u2019t have to know.)\nFather sends Azula to bring the banished prince and his useless escort home. They\u2019ve been branded traitors after their betrayal during the Siege of the North. Azula smiles when Father tells her that she\u2019s going to bring them back to face justice, and sees her own cruel smile directed back at her on his face.\u00a0\nZuko and Uncle Iroh are about to join her on the ship, ostensibly to return home. In the middle of her impromptu speech about Father\u2019s forgiveness, Azula uses a contraction where she usually wouldn\u2019t. It means nothing to everyone else. She isn\u2019t sure if it will mean anything to Zuko, but if he ends up a prisoner because of his own stupidity and forgetfulness, Azula will not lose any sleep over it.\u00a0\nZuko has trusted her this far. Poor, ignorant,  stupid  Zuko. How he has survived three years without her, Azula will never know.\nZuko picks up on the contraction. He meets Azula\u2019s eyes as Uncle Iroh asks his questions, and the skin where his left eyebrow should be twitches.  Is that true?\u00a0 \nAzula maintains eye contact and blinks twice.\u00a0\nZuko and the useless old man escape. Oops. Well, Azula can hardly be held responsible for Uncle Iroh\u2019s mistrust of his dearest brother, can she?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuzu follows her as she tracks the Avatar. Zuko fights  against  her, which reminds Azula of the days that they had found abandoned areas to train together (in secret, because Father would not approve; but since Zuko was never going to catch up with her bending anyway, Azula thought that he could stand to be a little less useless).\u00a0\n(Zuzu has clearly been training in their years apart. He\u2019s still no match for Azula -  nobody  is a match for Azula - but she would be impressed if she was the kind of person who was ever impressed.)\nAzula hits Uncle Iroh with lightning to distract them. It\u2019s not so bad that it will harm him long term. Azula doesn\u2019t care, because Uncle Iroh has always preferred Zuko and had been  useless  at the Agni Kai (Azula had been useless, too, but she doesn\u2019t dwell on that). But Azula knows that Zuko cares for the stupid, fat old man, so she withholds herself from hurting him seriously.\nIt\u2019s a distraction, but not quite enough. The Avatar and his friends corner her. Zuko is with them. They\u2019re a perfectly matched set, Azula realises: air, earth, water,  fire. She sees forward, then, always ten steps ahead of her opponents. If Zuko is banished much longer, he might be convinced to join them. He\u2019s weak like that, Azula\u2019s brother.\u00a0\nShe holds her own, but there needs to be some give somewhere. She can\u2019t touch her hair while protecting herself, so she meets Zuko\u2019s eyes and blows a puff of dark hair away from her face.\u00a0\nZuko understands. Azula can see it in his eyes. For a moment, she thinks that he won\u2019t respond; after all, she did just hurt his favourite toy. But then Zuko frowns and twists his wrist,  I have your back; wait for your cue, and then he breaks formation and turns against the others.\u00a0\nAzula runs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt takes some time, but Azula convinces Father to let Zuko come home for real. He won\u2019t be a prisoner; he\u2019ll be restored to his rightful place by Azula\u2019s side.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s perfect for long days that turn into long weeks. Zuko starts dating Mai, which Azula had tried to manipulate into happening when they were children, before she had started to question whether it would actually be good for Zuko for reasons that she won\u2019t put into words. But whether they\u2019re dating or not, Mai and Ty Lee adore Zuko as much as they had as children, and they fear Azula enough to ensure that nothing will happen to him.\u00a0\nZuko spends time with Azula, spends most of his time with Azula, but he also stares off into the distance in a way that he\u2019s never done before.\u00a0\nAzula takes to regularly raising her right eyebrow in his direction,  are you okay, and Zuko nods at her but never blinks a response.\u00a0\nZuko leaves again. He doesn\u2019t say anything to Azula, through words or through actions. He just betrays them and leaves. Father says that he has committed treason and joined the Avatar against them.\u00a0\nAzula had seen that coming, but she thought that getting Zuko back home would change things. She doesn\u2019t tell Father this, of course; nobody needs to know that she had foreseen her brother\u2019s treason.\nAzula directs fire and lightning at all of Zuko\u2019s belongings, but Zuko doesn\u2019t seem to care for  things  the way that he used to. The truth is this: Azula doesn\u2019t know him that well anymore. He had been torn from her for three whole years, spent his time travelling and hunting while Azula was home. They don\u2019t know each other anymore. The old Zuzu would have told her before leaving. He would have asked if Azula wanted to come with him.\u00a0\n(She doesn\u2019t, of course. She would have said no and would have restrained him, told their Father, and then found some coincidental way to let him escape if the punishment was too severe. Prison would have been acceptable, at least for a while. But Azula would have saved him from death.\u00a0\nAzula hadn\u2019t saved him from Father before. Maybe that\u2019s why Zuko doesn\u2019t trust her now.)\u00a0\nZuko is gone again. He doesn\u2019t write this time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Azula next sees Zuko, she shoots fire before asking any questions.\nShe\u2019s  incensed. All the loyalty Azula has shown him (preparing to run away with him at nine years old, telling him that the end of his banishment was a trap, getting him  actually un-banished), and he\u2019s thrown it all away. For what? The Avatar?\u00a0\nThey fight in silence atop the gondola. Sword peasant tries to get in the way.\nThe guards start cutting the line.\u00a0\nAzula looks to her brother as Ty Lee shouts that they need to retreat. Her stupid brother, who was loyal to a fault when it did him no favours, and then abandoned his loyalty once it was rewarded. Abandoned  her.\u00a0\nAzula is furious. But she\u2019s also not stupid.\u00a0\n\u201cGo,\u201d she says to Ty Lee, who doesn\u2019t need to be told twice. Her brother saves sword peasant from falling to his death, and then looks back at Azula instead of ducking down into the metal container that\u2019s about to be submerged in boiling water. \u201cCome back with me,\u201d she finds herself saying.\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019ll kill me,\u201d Zuko points out.\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Azula shrugs. \u201cBut you\u2019ll definitely die if you stay here.\u201d\u00a0\nZuko\u2019s mouth pulls down. The gondola shakes.\u00a0\nAzula thinks about what this looks like to the guards on the platform. She twists her wrist -  wait for your cue - and then shoots fire. Zuko dodges and shoots back.\u00a0\n\u201cAm I going to have to knock you out to take you back with me?\u201d Azula snarls, and shoots fire with intent, because they are  running out of time.\u00a0 \nThe gondola stops shaking, shudders once, and then keeps moving.\u00a0\nThey both look back.\n\u201cMai,\u201d Azula says.\u00a0\n\u201cWhich one of us is she protecting?\u201d Zuko asks, confused.\u00a0\nMai\u2019s eyes flash up at them, and then she goes back to fighting the guards.\u00a0\nAzula can\u2019t be sure of Mai's loyalties, but she also can\u2019t be sure that it matters right now. Mai knows good and well that fearing Azula also means protecting Zuko, after all.\u00a0\nZuko twists his wrist and shoots fire. Azula follows suit, putting on a show for her allies on the platform and his allies below them.\n\u201cFather won\u2019t be merciful,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cThere\u2019s no going back now. Not for me.\u201d\u00a0\nHe\u2019s right. Father won\u2019t be merciful. Zuko has allied himself with the Avatar, the man he was sent on an impossible mission to capture. There\u2019s a great irony here, which Azula will have to remember to laugh at later.\u00a0\nAzula turns into a spin and kicks out blue fire. Zuko blocks, turns, shoots.\u00a0\nAzula thinks that they might be recreating a training session from their childhood. It\u2019s almost like dancing.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no going back for Zuko. If they win this war, Zuko will have to die or be imprisoned or disappear. Even if Zuko manages to disappear and miraculously evade being hunted, there will be no monthly letters to assure Azula that Zuko is alive and whole. If he is captured, Father won\u2019t pull back like he did in the Agni Kai. Death will be a mercy. Imprisonment will mean regular torture.\u00a0\nAzula sees a hundred possibilities, and none of them look good for Zuko if Father wins. If Father doesn\u2019t win, none of the possibilities look good for Azula. One of them has to die or be imprisoned or disappear.\u00a0\nNo. Azula will not accept that. She\u2019s very in touch, suddenly, with the nine-year-old girl who had packed her things and told her brother they were running away.\u00a0\n\u201cYou should go back,\u201d Zuko says, turn, block, shoot, turn. \u201cBut I want you to know - Father said - Father said when I was leaving--\u201d Block, shoot. \u201cMother is alive.\u201d\u00a0\nAzula thinks about being nine, and their mother kissing them and saying  you\u2019re going to need to take care of each other once I\u2019m gone.\u00a0\nAzula has been loyal to Father for years, has been the perfect picture of a loyal Fire Princess. What has she gotten from it? She\u2019s watched her brother burn and had him taken away from her -  her  brother,  hers. She\u2019s been afraid to even reply to his letters, lest she be burned and cast aside like he was.\u00a0\nAzula sees blue.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no big time limit now that the line isn\u2019t in danger of being cut. She keeps fighting (dancing) with her brother, enjoying the heat of his flames. (They\u2019ve changed recently, in some foundational sense that Azula doesn\u2019t understand. They\u2019re almost golden.) Her mind ticks through the future and the past.\nThey end up tumbling onto the ground, followed by a confused group. Azula leads them far enough away from the idiot they captured that he won\u2019t be able to hear them talking.\n\u201cFather said you redirected his lightning,\u201d she says, and then blocks his fire and sends her own. They must be putting on such a pretty show for the Boiling Rock. Zuko\u2019s new friends have seemed unsure of whether or not to interrupt them on a moving gondola, but now that they\u2019re on solid ground, sword peasant and her Kyoshi prisoner start to draw nearer again. She shoots a warning blast in their direction. They\u2019ll only get one warning.\nZuko does a move that Azula has never seen, probably because it\u2019s made up, but she makes mental notes about it anyway.\u00a0\n\u201cI did,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nGood.\u00a0\n\u201cDo it again,\u201d she says. \u201cAim next to my foot. Make it look like you got me.\u201d\nZuko doesn\u2019t look like he understands why, but Azula will have to trust him to follow directions. If he isn\u2019t ready, well, that\u2019s hardly her fault.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe calls lightning and blasts it at her brother.\u00a0\nZuzu takes it and smoothly redirects it, hitting the ground beside her.\u00a0\nAzula drops to the ground. Zuzu catches her like a hero in one of Mother's plays, and then heaves her inelegantly over his shoulder. \u201cAm I kidnapping you?\u201d he asks, and she chuckles and directs him to their transport.\u00a0\nZuko puts her down on her feet once they\u2019re inside, and the whole group looks at her in shock.\u00a0\n\u201cSo who knows how to pilot one of these things?\u201d Azula asks, smirking.\u00a0\nZuko smiles at her.\nThe psychotic princess is placed on her feet. And she is  very much awake.\u00a0\nSokka tries not to panic.\u00a0\n\u201cSo who knows how to pilot one of these things?\u201d she asks, moving toward the controls, and Zuko smiles at her like this is normal and okay  when it clearly is neither of those things.\u00a0 \nSokka makes a noise. It\u2019s a primal noise originating somewhere in his soul. It\u2019s definitely at least 50% a question.\n\u201cFine, then I\u2019m piloting, but I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going,\u201d Psycho Sister says in a sing-song voice, and their airship takes off.\u00a0\n\u201cThat way,\u201d her brother says, leaning over the wheel to point in the direction they need to be going.\u00a0\nSokka makes the noise again.\n\u201cRelax, peasant,\u201d Psycho Sister insists. \u201cI\u2019m clearly not here to endanger your worthless life.\u201d\nDad clears his throat, and Sokka looks toward him with a sense of hope. If anyone can make sense of this situation, it\u2019s Dad.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse us, Princess, but we were led to believe that Zuko was\u2026 taking you against your will.\u201d\u00a0\nThe scary siblings share a glance, and then Azula goes back to flying.\u00a0\nZuko turns to face them more fully. \u201cAzula and I need to talk about a few things,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt seemed that the easiest way to do that was to make it looked like she... didn't intentionally join us. That way, she can return home without facing questions of treason.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTreason is really Zuzu\u2019s thing,\u201d Psycho Sister adds, cheerfully.\u00a0\nZuko slants a glance at her. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t personal.\u201d\nAzula slams a hand against the wheel. Blue fire dances out and licks across it, which is  worrying .\u00a0\n\u201cYou left  Mai  a letter.\u201d\nZuko does that very-careful-breathing thing that he does sometimes, which always makes Sokka think that he\u2019s either on the edge of a panic attack or a furious tantrum.\u00a0\n\u201cI knew what to say to Mai,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cI-- I didn\u2019t know what to say to you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHow about  wow, Azula, thanks for convincing Father to take me back and restore my crown, thanks for fixing everything for me! Something along those lines would have done nicely.\u201d\nZuko nods. \u201cI am grateful,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what Fa-- What Fire Lord Ozai is doing isn\u2019t right. I shouldn\u2019t have come back with you in the first place. I betrayed Uncle.\u201d\n\u201cThe fat old man betrayed  you,\u201d Psycho Sister snarls. Thankfully, there are no flames this time. \u201cAnd then you betrayed  me.\u201d\n\u201cNever,\u201d Zuko disagrees. \u201cNever that.\u201d\u00a0\nThey seem to share some kind of silent communication again, and Psycho Sister turns back to navigating. Zuko carefully corrects her course, and Sokka, who cannot take it anymore, points out: \u201cWhy are we taking her to our hideout?\u201d\n\u201cIs sword peasant always this chatty?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIs--  sword peasant? \u201d Sokka splutters.\u00a0\n\u201cWe can just go and make camp somewhere in the middle of nowhere,\u201d Zuko suggests. \u201cWe just need\u2026\u201d he looks to his sister thoughtfully, and then says: \u201cA day?\u201d\nZuko\u2019s sister snorts. \u201cA day and a half,\u201d she corrects. \u201cYou\u2019re teaching me how to redirect lightning, and I want to know about those weird new forms you\u2019ve picked up.\u201d\n\u201cLightning, new forms,\u201d Zuko lists, the corner of his mouth lifting into a smile, \u201cand treason.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTalking  about treason,\u201d Psycho Sister amends. \u201cTalking about the possibility of talking about treason.\u201d She glances over her shoulder at the rest of the group. \u201cIf any of you say anything about this, nobody will believe you and I\u2019ll make your pathetic lives very miserable.\u201d\u00a0\nDad looks almost amused. Suki looks very annoyed.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, right,\u201d Psych Sister says, turning completely away from the wheel. Zuko takes over, as if he had been waiting for his sister to get bored with that power play. \u201cKyoshi. It was so  nice  spending time together before. I\u2019m glad we got to meet again.\u201d\u00a0\nSokka refrains from stepping protectively in front of Suki, because a) Suki can take care of herself, and b) Suki would kick his ass for trying.\u00a0\nSuki folds her arms. \u201cI\u2019ll admit that I find the whole \u2018let\u2019s talk about treason\u2019 thing surprising. I thought you were so loyal to your dear, evil father.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s not goad the scary princess into being loyal to her evil father,\u201d Sokka suggests, and is surprised when Zuko snorts.\u00a0\nHonestly, Sokka is so not done being surprised by everything with Zuko. Every time he thinks he\u2019s got the guy figured out, he turns on his heel. Not that bad a guy? Betrays them in Ba Sing Se. Totally evil and returned to his father? Breaks out to teach Aang firebending, and then breaks into a prison to help Sokka rescue his father. Actually pretty cool and badass? Buddying up with his psychotic sister again.\u00a0\n\u201cLook, I know this is confusing,\u201d he says, and then Dad raises a hand to stop him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s family,\u201d Hakoda says firmly, as if this explains everything. \u201cI get it. But we don\u2019t know that we can trust your sister.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you definitely can\u2019t,\u201d the scary siblings say in unison, and then look at each other with twin smirks. It\u2019s terrifying and not kind of funny at all. Sokka relaxes his hand from the grip on his sword that he hadn\u2019t even been conscious of.\u00a0\n\u201cThen,\u201d Hakoda goes on, \u201cwe should not return to the others.\u201d\u00a0\nThat\u2019s smart, Sokka thinks, even though he realises that it means that they\u2019re going to have to camp somewhere with the prince and princess of the Fire Nation. His heart sinks at the thought. But at least he has Dad and Suki, and also Chit Sang, he guesses.\u00a0\n\u201cWell that\u2019s just fine,\u201d Psycho Sister insists, her voice too high for her normal pitch. \u201cI\u2019m sure that you can convince me to commit treason against my dear father without the Avatar\u2019s help. And if you can\u2019t, it\u2019s not like I would be a significant ally or anything.\u201d\u00a0\nZuko leans forward until his forehead is pressed against the steering wheel. Sokka is pretty sure that isn\u2019t a proper steering technique.\u00a0\n\u201cWe can always move as soon as she goes,\u201d he suggests.\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Hakoda replies, voice firm. \u201cWe will not endanger the Avatar and everyone else.\u201d\u00a0\nIf Sokka hadn\u2019t been watching Psycho Sister\u2019s face, he wouldn\u2019t have seen it happen.\u00a0\nPsycho Sister is very carefully watching Zuko\u2019s back, which draws Sokka\u2019s gaze there, and-- Zuko has stood up from where he was leaning against the steering wheel. His hands are now perfectly placed, and his back is so tense that it looks painful.\u00a0\nPsycho Sister screws up her nose and looks over at Dad.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, you don\u2019t get to tell us what to do when Zuzu and I could probably take everyone here down in moments,\u201d she says.\u00a0\nSokka watches Hakoda\u2019s frown deepen.\n\u201cHow nice of you to include me,\u201d Zuko replies, \u201cbut you could probably do that by yourself.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh dear brother, it would take me at least a degree of the sun alone.\u201d Psycho Sister smiles. It looks predatory.\u00a0\n\u201cSo your plan, just to-- just to get this straight - your plan is to threaten us to take you to the Avatar? The two of you, who\u2019ve both hunted the Avatar before? And we\u2019re supposed to just let you do it?\u201d Sokka massages his temples.\u00a0\nThey must have communicated somehow, because Psycho Sister takes the wheel and Zuko turns to face the group.\u00a0\n\u201cI know how it must look,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you saw what happened back there. Azula wants everyone to think that she\u2019s been kidnapped to give us time to\u2026 come to an agreement. It will be easier to do that if Aang is with us. And whether or not we come to an agreement, Azula has to play this like she was kidnapped or it will look like treason.\u201d\n\u201cYou can all relax,\u201d Psycho Sister insists. \u201cYou have my word, on my honour as a daughter of Fire Lord Ozai and Lady Ursa, I will not harm the Avatar as long as I am a guest. We\u2019ll all just play this as a friendly kidnapping. And then once I\u2019m gone, you\u2019ll move on and I\u2019ll lead my people to your conveniently abandoned camp.\u201d\u00a0\nSokka doesn\u2019t like this at all. And Sokka doesn\u2019t understand Zuko at all, but he  does  kind of trust the guy. It\u2019s hard not to trust someone who came with you to break into and then out of the scariest prison imaginable, and does so for no personal benefit.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you vouch for her?\u201d Sokka asks.\u00a0\nZuko turns to his sister and meets her eyes. Then he smiles. He\u2019s probably smiled more in this hour than in their entire enemy-turned-friendship. \u201cOn my honour as a son of Lady Ursa and brother of Crown Princess Azula of the Blue Fire, I swear that my sister will not harm the Avatar - or the Avatar\u2019s friends - as long as she is with us by invitation.\u201d\nSokka doesn\u2019t miss the changes in language, and apparently neither does Psycho Sister. She shrugs and then nods.\u00a0\n\u201cThen we\u2019re going back to camp with one more royal than intended,\u201d Sokka says, decisively.\u00a0\nHakoda and Suki do not look impressed.\u00a0\nChit Sang does not look like he\u2019s been paying attention.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSeveral things happen in quick succession when they arrive at camp.\nSokka and Hakoda leave the airship, and Katara sobs out a laugh as she embraces their father.\u00a0\nSuki is met with delighted laughter.\u00a0\nSokka tries to warn them about who\u2019s coming out next, but he doesn\u2019t get very far. \u201cOkay, so don\u2019t panic, but remember Zuko\u2019s psychotic sister?\u201d\n\u201cI shall defeat you and regain my honour, Avatar!\u201d Psycho Sister shrieks as she exits the airship, and then she laughs.\u00a0\nZuko has one hand over his face. \u201cShe\u2019s kidding,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s-- She\u2019s kidding. Azula is here to parley.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cEw, don\u2019t call it \u2018parley\u2019, brother,\u201d Psycho Sister insists. \u201cCall it casually discussing treason over swapping lightning bending techniques.\u201d\n\u201cSwapping?\u201d Zuko asks.\u00a0\nPsycho Sister rolls her eyes. \u201cYes, Zuzu,  swapping. It\u2019s long past time that you learn to bend lightning.\u201d\u00a0\nSomething complicated happens on Zuko\u2019s face, something that\u2019s half-almost-a-smile and half-almost-a-frown.\u00a0\n\u201cYou  brought her here?\u201d Katara shouts, pulling water up in preparation for a fight. \u201cAfter what she did to Aang? After what  you  let her do to Aang? She almost killed him!\u201d\nAang, who has been decidedly silent thus far, clears his throat. \u201cHi,\u201d he says to Princess Psycho.\u00a0\n\u201cBy my honour and Zuzu\u2019s, blah blah,\u201d Psycho Sister states, \u201cnot here to hurt you. Really not the most important thing right now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m new,\u201d Chit Sang introduces himself, and Sokka really thinks that he hasn\u2019t noticed what\u2019s happening around here.\u00a0\nKatara turns on Sokka. \u201cHow could you bring her here?\u201d\u00a0\nPsycho Sister also turns to her brother. \u201cYou\u2019re their friend, you convince them.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHe is  not  our friend!\u201d Katara shouts.\u00a0\nPsycho Sister raises an unimpressed eyebrow. \u201cReally? Because he and sword peasant seemed pretty buddy-buddy over there.\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Sokka. I know you know my name is Sokka.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I know that?\u201d Psycho Sister asks, and Sokka carefully resolves to refer to her by her actual name, because it makes him the Bigger Man. Bigger Person. \u201cWho are you, again?\u201d\u00a0\nSokka squeaks in indignation. Zuko has his face in his palm again.\n\u201cLook, this\u2026 isn\u2019t going well. Can we just? Azula and I need to talk about a few things, away from everything else, where she won\u2019t be accused of treason,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s just talking. Terms, possibilities. No fighting while we\u2019re here, aside from training. Once we know how we\u2019re going forward, Azula will leave.\u201d\u00a0\nAzula smirks. \u201cI\u2019m your house guest,\u201d she says, holding out her arms. \u201cOr, well, your whatever-this-is guest.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Aang asks, sounding genuinely curious instead of furious and/or terrified, which are the only two appropriate responses. \u201cI thought it was kind of obvious that you were with the Fire Lord and Zuko was with us?\u201d\u00a0\nAzula looks down her nose at him. \u201cIt\u2019s worth revising,\u201d she says.\u00a0\nAang blinks and tilts his head. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nAzula frowns. \u201cBecause at this rate, either  we  win and Zuko dies or is tortured or hunted, or  you  win and I die or am tortured or hunted,\u201d she explains, like he\u2019s a particularly slow child. (Aang is actually a particularly fast child, in a great variety of ways.) \u201cWe\u2019re going to put our heads together and figure out if there\u2019s an option where we both survive.\u201d\nZuko\u2019s face is doing that complicated thing again. Sokka is a little grossed out when he realises that it\u2019s something like love for his sister and gratitude that she\u2019s here. Barf. I mean, sure, Sokka would be pretty delighted in his circumstances, but Katara is only an annoying little sister in a normal way, not a destroy-the-world-just-to-watch-it-burn way.\u00a0\n\u201cSo you\u2019re here to convince Zuko to join you again?\u201d Toph asks, arms crossed and shoulders up. Sokka softens. Toph likes Zuko more than the rest of them, including Sokka, who thinks that it\u2019s really cool and also really unfair that Zuko is a master firebender  and  a master swordsman.\u00a0\nAzula sighs, and this  also  sounds like they\u2019re particularly slow children.\u00a0\nZuko takes over. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that, even if I wanted to - which I don\u2019t,\u201d he explains. \u201cFather would just kill me or imprison me until he\u2019s bored enough to kill me. Azula is\u2026 considering other options.\u201d\n\u201cShe is considering joining our cause,\u201d Hakoda says, though he sounds unsure about it.\u00a0\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Azula says. \u201cDon\u2019t say it like  that. Say it like this: Azula is considering usurping her father.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHave you thought about running away?\u201d Zuko asks. \u201cI don\u2019t want to, but\u2026 I want to know what you think is on the table.\u201d\u00a0\nAzula glares. \u201cFather burned half your face off, Zuzu, you\u2019re hardly going to fit in. Plus, me? Keeping a low profile?\u201d She laughs, high-pitched and a little psychotic. \u201cNo, it\u2019s treason or nothing, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\u00a0\nZuko nods. He looks around the group, seemingly unsure of himself.\u00a0\nIt's somehow never occurred to Sokka to wonder how Zuko got that scar. Azula throws around that it was seriously messed up child abuse in such a casual manner. And Zuko doesn't even flinch.\u00a0\n\u201cI will vouch for her, and stay with her,\u201d he says. \u201cAzula won\u2019t harm anyone while she\u2019s here. On my honour.\u201d\u00a0\nSokka is still watching Psycho--  Azula, so he sees her anglershark grin widen and her eyes brighten. Sokka\u2019s stomach drops.\u00a0\n\u201cI did swear not to hurt the Avatar or any of the Avatar\u2019s friends, and I intend to stick to that,\u201d she says. Zuko isn\u2019t looking at his sister, but Azula is looking at him. \u201cWhich reminds me, Zuzu. Catch!\u201d\u00a0\nThat\u2019s when she flings lightning at Zuko.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThings happen in quick succession again.\u00a0\nZuko does the same move as before, apparently just absorbing the lightning and flinging it away. It goes over the edge of a cliff.\u00a0\nKatara brings up water and knocks Azula backwards, almost off her feet.\u00a0\nAnd then Zuko is in front of Azula, protecting her with a fire wall.\nAnd Katara and Zuko shout almost the same words at almost the same time:\n\u201cLeave him alone! \u201d\n\u201cLeave her alone! \u201d\nEveryone takes a breath. Zuko\u2019s wall flickers away. Katara\u2019s water drops.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Katara says, her voice filled with pure rage, \u201cwas  that? \u201d\nAzula laughs, sharp and dangerous.\u00a0\n\u201cI promised not to hurt any of the Avatar\u2019s friends,\u201d she points out, gleeful. \u201cYou told me that Zuzu isn\u2019t a friend.\u201d\u00a0\nShe seems to think this is hilarious. Judging by the not-quite-tic at Zuko\u2019s mouth, he also thinks it\u2019s kind of funny.\u00a0\nSokka. Doesn\u2019t understand Zuko  at all.\u00a0\n\u201cDid you get a good look at the move?\u201d he asks, stepping away from his protective stance. \u201cI would prefer some warning next time.\u201d\u00a0\nKatara still looks furious.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd miss out on an opportunity to have the waterbender prove that she was lying about not liking you? Come now, Zuzu, I wouldn\u2019t leave your pride in tatters like that,\u201d she says. And then she holds up a hand. \u201cHand.\u201d Zuko doesn\u2019t move. \u201cNow, or more lightning.\u201d\nZuko holds up his left hand and lets Azula inspect it.\n\u201cI thought so,\u201d Azula says. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting yourself every time you redirect lightning. You need a better handle on the form. Luckily you now have me to hit you with lightning regularly.\u201d\u00a0\nKatara looks  furious. \u201cDo NOT do that,\u201d she orders. \u201cLightning can be very damaging to the heart and basically all of the internal organs. You shouldn\u2019t be  playing  with it.\u201d\nAzula\u2019s grin is now less anglershark and more told-you-so. \u201cAw, you do care.\u201d\u00a0\nKatara glowers. Azula practically preens.\u00a0\n\u201cUm,\u201d Aang pipes up. \u201cSo can you\u2026 get on with the parley? So that Princess Azula can leave?\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor all the waterbender insists that Zuzu isn\u2019t her friend, she sure does fuss over the effects of the lightning. She also shoves a bowl of food at him, glaring like the facial expression will somehow counteract the action. After a moment, she holds out a second bowl to Zuko, who then passes it to Azula.\nAzula looks down her nose at it. \u201cChances it\u2019s poisoned?\u201d she asks Zuko.\nZuko shrugs. \u201cThey haven\u2019t tried to poison me yet,\u201d he says, and swaps their bowls.\u00a0\nThe waterbender looks furious. Azula kind of loves it.\u00a0\nThey all move to sit around the place that the campfire would be if it was later in the day. It\u2019s wonderfully awkward, and the rest of the group give her and Zuko a wide berth. Azula wonders if they always do this to Zuko. Did her brother abandon family only to be considered an outcast here?\u00a0\nThe dirt gremlin sighs wearily and sits on Zuko\u2019s other side. \u201cSo,\u201d she says, loud enough to be a little obnoxious. \u201cTreason, huh?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re hardly discussing it with you,\u201d Azula replies, affronted. \u201cYou\u2019re nobody.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cShe\u2019s not nobody,\u201d Zuko disagrees. Ooh. Zuko likes this one - that\u2019s interesting. \u201cBut I think it might be a conversation best left to the two of us, Toph.\u201d\u00a0\nToph scoffs. \u201cWhat is there to converse about? She\u2019s either with us or she isn\u2019t. It\u2019s not that complicated.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cActually, it\u2019s very complicated. See, if you really wanted to convince me you have a chance of winning, you\u2019d need to tell me your plan. But you can\u2019t, because if I don\u2019t join you, your plan won\u2019t work.\u201d Azula laughs at the delightfully terrible situation they\u2019re in. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a fun paradox?\u201d\nZuko chews on his rice for a moment, and then points his chopsticks at her. His manners are atrocious. Azula wonders whether it\u2019s time with these peasant children, or three years with sailors. \u201cSo how do we have this conversation without endangering ourselves?\u201d\n\u201cStart from \u2018why\u2019,\u201d the non-idiot adult suggests. Azula slants a glance over to him. He\u2019s a Water Tribe chief, and he makes Zuko very nervous, and Azula isn\u2019t sure if he has a history with this man or if he\u2019s just nervous around fathers now.\u00a0\nBoth options make her fire crackle at her skin.\u00a0\n\u201cYou already know why,\u201d Zuko replies, and Azula is so correct about this; he\u2019s tensed up again. \u201cShe already said. We\u2019re looking for a way to both survive.\u201d\nAzula raises her chin. \u201cZuko\u2019s life and freedom is second only to mine,\u201d she says, and it\u2019s probably the kindest thing she\u2019s ever said. She\u2019s honestly a little grossed out that she made that declaration in front of Zuko\u2019s peasant friends.\u00a0\nShe is definitely a little confused by how unimpressed they seem. The waterbender is looking at her like she said something insulting.\nZuko, at least, has the good sense to look stunned. \u201cThat\u2019s the nicest thing you\u2019ve ever said to me,\u201d he tells her, and Azula rolls her eyes for an excuse to look away.\n\u201cThat\u2019s  the nicest thing she\u2019s ever said to you?\u201d the sword peasant exclaims. He waves his hands at her, and Azula lazily thinks that he should pull them back before he loses them. \u201cYour loyalties are confusing!\u201d\u00a0\nZuko and Azula meet eyes and shrug.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly what I meant,\u201d the Water Tribe chief interjects. \u201cI meant to start with Zuko\u2019s \u2018why\u2019. Maybe it will help if you understand why he is here.\u201d\nAzula glances to the chief, and then back to her brother. \u201cI don\u2019t need that. First of all, it doesn\u2019t matter why. What matters is that you can\u2019t come home while Father is on the Dragon Throne. Secondly, I already know why. Turns out you can\u2019t burn half your son\u2019s face off for speaking out of turn and expect loyalty from him.\u201d Hush falls across the group. \u201cFather always did understand being a Fire Lord more than being a father.\u201d\nIt might be the most insulting thing that Azula has ever said about her father, on the heels of the kindest thing she\u2019s ever said about her brother. Oops. Is this what shifting loyalties feel like? She\u2019ll have to consult with Zuzu, whose loyalties seem to shift like the sand.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s not why,\u201d Zuko says, quietly. Azula raises her eyebrows. (Both of them. Surprise, not code.) \u201cI stayed loyal to Father for three years after the Agni Kai.\u201d\n\u201cIt did seem that way from your letters,\u201d Azula admits, \u201cbut I figured you knew they were being intercepted.\u201d\nZuko suddenly looks intently at her. \u201cYou read my letters?\u201d\u00a0\nAzula blinks, surprised by his confusion. \u201cYou sent a letter every month. Why did you continue if you thought I wasn\u2019t reading them?\u201d\n\u201cYou never replied, not once,\u201d Zuko accuses.\n\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want anyone to read  my  intercepted letters,\u201d Azula points out. \u201cDid you really think I wasn\u2019t even reading them?\u201d\n(Azula thinks of herself at eleven years old, carefully replying to the first letter, and then standing with it in her hand as she tried to figure out what to do with it. She thinks of herself resolving to burn it, and how every letter after that had felt so natural. Of course she had to burn them. Azula knew the price of weakness, and she knew that Zuko had the potential to be her greatest weakness.)\u00a0\nZuko looks away with a frown, and then freezes.\u00a0\nAzula glances to see what\u2019s caused the reaction, to find that they\u2019re being stared at with many sets of very wide eyes, including two anonymous peasant children that Azula hadn\u2019t even noticed were there, one of whom is in a wheelchair. Only the useless adult looks like he\u2019s paying more attention to his food than the conversation.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Azula snaps. \u201cDoes Zuzu have something on his face?\u201d\u00a0\nShe hadn\u2019t meant to refer to the scar, but considering the previous conversation, she finds herself smirking at her own wording.\n\u201cThree years,\u201d the blind dirt child says. \u201cThat would\u2019ve made you my age.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThirteen,\u201d Zuko corrects immediately.\u00a0\nThe dirt child nods. \u201cI think we all assumed it was a training accident,\u201d she explains. \u201cNot\u2026 for speaking out of turn.\u201d\n\u201cWhy  wasn\u2019t  that what turned you against Fire Lord Worst-Dad-Ever?\u201d the sword peasant asks, incredulous. \u201cI mean, if that didn\u2019t turn you, what did?\u201d\u00a0\nZuko blinks, and then frowns. \u201cI realised what he was doing was wrong,\u201d he says eventually, slowly and carefully, while maintaining very specific breaths. He doesn\u2019t like this conversation at all, Azula realises. He likes this less than talking about the Agni Kai. \u201cIt took me a long time. Too long.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAll right, I\u2019m bored now.\u201d Azula to the rescue. Agni, but is she a sap, saving Zuko like this. She places her half-eaten bowl to one side. \u201cCome on. We\u2019re fighting and talking about more interesting things.\u201d\u00a0\nThe water bender is glaring at her. Azula doesn\u2019t know how she has earned this particular glare, but she decides that she doesn\u2019t care.\u00a0\nZuko shovels a few more bites into his mouth, graceless and without manners, and then stands to lead her to an appropriate space.\nThey\u2019re followed.\u00a0\n\u201cAre we going to have an audience?\u201d she asks, glancing over her shoulder to be sure of exactly how far they are.\u00a0\nZuko sighs, weary.\u00a0\n\u201cIs this what teaching the Avatar is like?\u201d Azula asks, genuinely curious.\u00a0\n\u201cOnly sometimes,\u201d Zuko replies. They\u2019ve reached an indoor space, a huge stone floor with pillars at the edges. It\u2019s more than enough space. Zuko walks to the edge and strips his tunic off.\u00a0\nAzula walks to the middle of the floor. \u201cThat\u2019s new,\u201d she says. \u201cYou used to be able to fight clothed.\u201d\nZuko huffs something that might have been a laugh on someone less uptight. \u201cI figured out how to stop them from criticising,\u201d he says, and nods over to the edge of the room with the small gathering of not-exactly-fans.\u00a0\nAzula looks over. The Water Tribe siblings and the Kyoshi girl are staring at Zuko. There might be blushing involved.\nAzula is delighted. \u201cHow did you even know the Kyoshi Warrior would react like that?\u201d she asks. \u201cDidn\u2019t you just meet?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you--\u201d Zuko starts, and then looks around. The three teenagers look away  completely conspicuously. Azula thinks that the sword peasant might even be whistling. \u201cNot her, too.\u201d\u00a0\nZuko looks toward the ceiling, and then decidedly faces away from their on-lookers. Azula doesn\u2019t, so she\u2019s treated to the moment that they start staring again, and also the moment that Chief Dad notices what\u2019s happening and looks distinctly bewildered and unimpressed.\u00a0\n\u201cTeenagers,\u201d she hears him grumble.\u00a0\nAzula\u2019s laughter bubbles up from somewhere deep when she remembers how Zuzu had stripped his tunic off before their game on the beach. He\u2019s become tactical.\u00a0\n\u201cSo now you\u2019ve resorted to using your body to distract your opponents?\u201d she asks.\u00a0\nZuko scowls. \u201cIt stops them from commenting on every technique I use with the Avatar,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd Aang doesn\u2019t even notice what\u2019s happening, he\u2019s a kid. Though I think Toph notices and just thinks it\u2019s funny.\u201d\u00a0\nAzula fakes a thoughtful expression. \u201cShould I also take my--\u201d\n\u201cSokka might actually have a heart attack,\u201d Zuko warns, and then falls into a battle position.\u00a0\nAzula doesn\u2019t know which one Sokka is, but she hopes that it\u2019s Water Chief Dad. He seems flustered enough by his children being real life teenagers that she probably could push him over the edge.\u00a0\nThey begin to fight.\u00a0\nIn the safety of this hideout, it becomes obvious to Azula that Zuzu was holding out on her on the gondola. He\u2019d only been trying to hold her back. Now, he\u2019s training with her, and she can see all of the smoothed out areas.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s gotten a  lot  better. Better even than the other times she\u2019s seen him bending this year.\u00a0\nAzula blocks and doesn\u2019t fire back. Zuko raises his right eyebrow,  are you okay, and Azula blinks. \u201cDo that again,\u201d she says, and Zuko fires. Azula steps aside instead of blocking and watches his fire. \u201cOne more time.\u201d Zuzu obeys.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Zuko asks, and Azula scowls at him.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a good thing that Father despises Zuko and would kill him upon sight. Otherwise, Azula might have to start getting worried. He isn\u2019t better than her by a long shot, but in a real fight, they would be more evenly matched than Azula is comfortable with.\n\u201cYour fire is different,\u201d she explains. \u201cI thought so before, but we were kind of busy. But now I can see it. There\u2019s a golden undertone that didn\u2019t used to be there.\u201d\u00a0\nZuko rolls his shoulders. \u201cYeah, I went through a whole thing,\u201d he says, like that\u2019s an explanation. \u201cI had to find an inner source for my fire that wasn\u2019t rage. Aang and I-- Never mind. The point is, the flame isn\u2019t from the same emotional source as before.\u201d\u00a0\nAzula tilts her head. \u201cYour little lightning problem. Was that the result of an inner issue?\u201d Zuzu nods. \u201cHave you tried again seriously since your big golden epiphany?\u201d\nOf course he hasn\u2019t. Zuzu is hopeless without her.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to practice lightning,\u201d she says, and gets him into the proper position.\u00a0\nLightning takes a long while to perfect. While she has him in stance, she says: \u201cTreason. What would happen afterwards?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou would be Fire Lord,\u201d Zuko states. \u201cWe would end the war.\u201d\u00a0\nAzula hums. \u201cName your terms.\u201d She shifts his posture.\u00a0\n\u201cDrawing back from all the front lines. The Fire Nation doesn\u2019t need to destroy the world to show our worth. If we are worthy, the other kingdoms will want to be in relationship with us.\u201d She makes him stretch, and he does so, and then closes his eyes. Lightning crackles around his knuckles, but it makes him wince. She shifts him back into the first stance. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to think about the colonies.\u201d\n\u201cFire Lord Azula and an end to the war,\u201d Azula summarises, even though an idea is niggling at the back of her mind. \u201cAnd we find Mother?\u201d\u00a0\nZuko\u2019s eyes open. \u201cWe find Mother.\u201d\u00a0\nThe lightning around his knuckles isn\u2019t the right colour. It was white-blue before, when it hurt him. Now, it\u2019s white-gold.\u00a0\nAzula steps back. \u201cShoot,\u201d she says.\u00a0\nZuko thrusts his hand forward, and lightning follows. It isn\u2019t strong yet, but it\u2019s there. And it\u2019s white-gold.\u00a0\nAzula smirks.\u00a0\n\u201cI did it,\u201d Zuko says, surprised.\u00a0\n\u201cI have a counter-proposal,\u201d Azula states. She walks around Zuko, checking his stance from all angles. \u201cI\u2019m well feared.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou are,\u201d Zuko agrees without hesitation.\u00a0\nAzula smiles. \u201cPeople would bow down to me in fear. The nations of the world would, if I told them to.\u201d\u00a0\nZuko\u2019s shoulders tighten a little. She coaxes them down.\u00a0\n\u201cWhich is why,\u201d Azula explains, \u201cI have a different proposal. Shoot.\u201d\u00a0\nZuko shoots again. The lightning is stronger this time. And Azula was right; it\u2019s golden.\u00a0\nHis fire will be golden one day, too. That will be a good symbol. The people will adore that.\u00a0\nAzula thinks back to the last Fire Lord who was loved instead of feared. It might not have occurred since the Fire Lord was also the head of the Fire Sages. Those had been peaceful times.\u00a0\n\u201cFire Lord Zuko,\u201d Azula proposes.\u00a0\nSilence falls.\u00a0\nZuko moves out of his stance and turns to her. \u201cYou\u2019re the Crown Princess.\u201d\n\u201cAnd as such, it is my right to name an heir and abdicate,\u201d Azula points out.\n\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d Zuko frowns. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be Fire Lord?\u201d\u00a0\nAzula smirks. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she says. \u201cBut think about it, Zuzu. Grandfather ruled from fear, and it got him killed.\u201d Zuko blinks, because he\u2019s innocent and hasn\u2019t yet internalised what Mother did for them. This is why Fire Lord Zuko will need Princess Azula. She will see the dark truth, and he will draw them toward the light. \u201cFather rules from fear. And nobody fears him more than us.\u201d\u00a0\nZuko nods his head, understanding dawning. \u201cAnd yet here we are, planning to usurp him.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRuling from fear doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Azula says, and she feels very enlightened. \u201cThe last Fire Lords I can recall who ruled over eras of peace were the ones who were loved. The people will fear me, but they won\u2019t love me. They will love you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhy would they love me?\u201d Zuko asks, honestly flummoxed.\u00a0\nAzula gestures to him. \u201cYou have the perfect story, brother,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe banished prince - banished for standing up to his evil father. Redeems himself and sees the light. Fire Lord Zuko of the Golden Flames. And if anyone does dare to use love as weakness?\u201d Azula flashes a dangerous smile. \u201cThen they know who is there by your side, keeping them in line.\u201d\u00a0\nThis might work. This might actually work.\u00a0\nZuko draws a calming breath. Azula thinks that he might be on the edge of panicking.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to be Fire Lord?\u201d he asks.\u00a0\n\u201cTough luck,\u201d Azula replies. \u201cI want the throne. I want you to have never left me. I want Mother to have never disappeared. But we don\u2019t get what we want, do we?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer little speech seems to have calmed the peasant children. They\u2019re less tense through the rest of the show, though that might be because they\u2019ve gotten used to seeing poor Zuzu without his shirt on.\u00a0\nZuko turns to teaching her to redirect lightning. She wonders if the lightning she\u2019ll redirect will glow golden or blue.\u00a0\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed how,\u201d Zuko points out.\u00a0\nAzula stands in place. \u201cEasy,\u201d she says, \u201cwe murder Father. Now, lightning.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLater, over a dinner that Azula can hardly taste, the whole group discusses the colonies.\u00a0\n\u201cWe might be able to pull back from a lot of the colonies, but some of them are a hundred years old. We can\u2019t just withdraw completely,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cPeople live there. They have families there. The culture is integrated.\u201d\u00a0\nAzula wants to snarl  and we won it fair and square, but that\u2019s not her job. Zuko knows her opinion. If she is going to be his trusted advisor, she also needs to trust him.\u00a0\n\u201cBut they\u2019re not yours,\u201d the water bender snaps. \u201cThey belong to the Earth Kingdom.\u201d\nThe Avatar sits up very straight, very suddenly. Azula thinks that he might have propelled himself into the air just a little. \u201cWait, what if it belongs to nobody?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a thing,\u201d Azula points out.\u00a0\n\u201cBut why not? Why not take places that have been all mixed up for a century and make them independent?\u201d\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a pause. Azula looks at Zuko, who looks back at her.\u00a0\n\u201cThat could work,\u201d Zuko says, slowly. \u201cThat could be a really good place for peace talks, too. Centres of trade. Nobody has a stronghold.\u201d\u00a0\nAzula frowns. \u201cIs the Avatar secretly a genius?\u201d she asks, and sees the Avatar beam in the corner of her vision.\nZuko holds her gaze. \u201cI cannot express to you how much that is not the case.\u201d\u00a0\nThe peasant children laugh. The not-useless-adult joins in. The Avatar pouts, but it seems good-natured.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll have children,\u201d Azula says, when Agni\u2019s face is leaving them.\nZuko turns to her with a curious expression. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou can marry if you want, but you won\u2019t have to. I\u2019ll marry someone politically convenient who\u2019ll be a good father. Who\u2019ll spend time with the children. And they\u2019ll spend time with you, learning, and be your heirs.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhere is this coming from?\u201d\u00a0\nAzula looks into the campfire instead of meeting his eyes. The campfire came from Zuko, and it\u2019s a little golden, too. It looks like their eyes, and it shifts with her brother\u2019s breath.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll revoke the laws against relationships between men and between women,\u201d she says, careful to sound casual.\nThe fire jumps at Zuko\u2019s sharp breath.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ll marry for love, if you ever do marry, and not for politics.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAzula,\u201d Zuzu says, and it\u2019s far too soft. \u201cWhy just me? We\u2019d be in charge. You could marry for love, too.\u201d\nAzula laughs. \u201cWhat use do I have for that?\u201d\u00a0\nShe finally meets Zuko\u2019s eyes. Zuzu\u2019s expression is almost too much to handle.\u00a0\n\u201cAre we really doing this?\u201d he asks. \u201cCommitting treason, instead of just talking about it?\u201d\u00a0\nThe rest of the campsite has fallen quiet. They\u2019ve been listening all along, Azula realises. Oops. She might have just told them more about Zuzu than she had been intending.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re waiting for Azula\u2019s response.\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about how,\u201d she relents. \n\u00a0\nThey stay up late into the night. Katara keeps herself awake because she doesn\u2019t trust either of the royal siblings, and while Aang is amazing and going to save the world, he\u2019s also sometimes overly trusting. He\u2019s lying in a pile of blankets by the fire, eyes drooping as if he isn\u2019t literally lying belly-up in front of a predator. A predator who\u2019s attacked and almost killed him before. Dad seems to understand the threat, because he stays up too, making carvings by the campfire and clearly eavesdropping.\nKatara is wide awake, largely because the evil twins recently dropped the information that their evil father is planning to destroy  everything  on the day of Sozin\u2019s Comet.\n\u201cIt has to be before the comet,\u201d Zuko agrees, staring intently into the campfire. \u201cThe question is just how long before. When is he actually expecting us.\u201d\nThe princess sighs as if her brother is particularly stupid. \u201cDummy, he\u2019s always expecting us. You, I mean. You\u2019re not going to catch him unaware. There\u2019s no element of surprise to be had.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Dad interrupts, as if he\u2019s less \u2018eavesdropping in case of danger\u2019 and more \u2018helping with the plan\u2019. \u201cI think  you\u2019re  the element of surprise, Princess Azula.\u201d\u00a0\nZuko\u2019s sister taps her index finger against her bottom lip, and then looks over to Aang. \u201cAre you really set on being the one who kills him?\u201d she asks.\nAang is very suddenly very awake. \u201cWhat? No! I don\u2019t want to kill anyone.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s war,\u201d the princess states. \u201cPeople die in war.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t have to  kill  them,\u201d Aang points out. He looks up at Katara, troubled, and Katara softens. \u201cI don\u2019t have to kill anyone, do I?\u201d\n\u201cI can kill him for you,\u201d the princess suggests.\u00a0\nAang looks hopelessly sad. \u201cBut he\u2019s your father!\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Zuko interjects, \u201che\u2019s not a very good father. We\u2019ve been over this.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just incapacitate him?\u201d Katara suggests. She\u2019s annoyed that she\u2019s now a part of the planning conversation instead of simply observing and guarding, but she\u2019s also desperate to wipe that expression from Aang\u2019s face.\u00a0\nZuko\u2019s sister scoffs and rolls her eyes, and Katara really, really wants to slam water into her again. It wasn\u2019t nearly satisfying enough earlier, because she had been too worried about stupid Zuko\u2019s stupid life. And Katara has been on the edge of her seat for multiple reasons today, including (but not limited to) the fact that the Fire Siblings have made a hobby out of tossing lightning back and forth like they\u2019re playing catch. Katara is very much ready to have either a fight or a heart attack.\n\u201cIf you do that, he\u2019ll have supporters waiting for his return,\u201d Zuko\u2019s sister points out. \u201cThere\u2019s no way they don\u2019t make an attempt at a coup at some point.\u201d\n\u201cThat might not be the worst thing,\u201d Dad says. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re strong enough to hold power, coups just draw out the poison. You learn who you can\u2019t trust.\u201d\n\u201cBut if we don\u2019t hold onto power\u2026\u201d Zuko points out, and then looks into the distance and shudders.\u00a0\nKatara is watching the siblings carefully, because she doesn\u2019t trust either of them as far as Momo could throw them, so she sees Zuko\u2019s sister watching Zuko\u2019s reaction, and the way that her mouth pulls down slightly. The pair meet eyes for a moment, and then go back to casually discussing whether or not they should continue the family tradition of patricide.\u00a0\nWell, Katara thinks, watching them. They\u2019re nothing like her and Sokka, that\u2019s for sure. They aren\u2019t physical at all with one another (Katara thinks that the only time they\u2019ve even touched was when correcting each other\u2019s katas, or that one moment in which Zuko\u2019s sister was inspecting the damage  she had done to his hand when she had attacked him). They don\u2019t use kind words (and even when he\u2019s being his most annoying, Sokka and Katara manage to occasionally say nice things to each other!). They seem more comfortable fighting one another than anything else. But that very small expression on the princess\u2019s face at least tells Katara that she cares about Zuko, in her own very messed up way.\u00a0\nThey start to sketch out a very vague plan. Katara ends up falling asleep on her father\u2019s shoulder, because she knows that he\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the evil twins.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatara wakes to screaming.\u00a0\nAang. Katara sits up abruptly, expecting to see the evil princess over Aang, but instead he\u2019s pointing toward the sky.\nThey\u2019ve been found. The Western Air Temple is under attack.\u00a0\nIn a rush of movement, the team takes cover. Toph and Haru work on earthbending a tunnel to get them out of there, and the princess turns to Zuko.\n\u201cYou need to leave me behind,\u201d she insists.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Zuko asks. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nBombs are still falling, and they have to shout to be heard. The others grab Appa and try to lead him toward the tunnels, but Appa doesn\u2019t want to go.\u00a0\n\u201cYou need to leave her behind,\u201d Dad agrees, shouting over the sound. \u201cThey\u2019re here for her!\u201d\nZuko looks lost. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t leave her if I had the chance,\u201d he insists. \u201cShe needs to break free herself, or they won\u2019t believe that she was really kidnapped.\u201d\nZuko\u2019s sister nods. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Dirt child, make me some handcuffs,\u201d she says, holding out her wrists.\u00a0\nKatara growls. How  dare  she call Toph that? Sure, Toph is a child and she is usually pretty dirty, but Toph has been nothing but helpful! And Princess Better-Than-Everyone has been nothing but a giant, dangerous pain the whole time she\u2019s been here!(This might not technically be true, the back of Katara\u2019s mind reminds her. She\u2019s probably going to betray them all, but she has helped Zuko to master lightning, so as long as  Zuko  doesn\u2019t betray them all - which is about half-and-half on probability - she has been  kind of  helpful.)\nWhile Aang continues to try to convince Appa to escape, Toph turns and stamps her foot. Rock clasps around the princess\u2019s wrists and ankles.\u00a0\nThe princess laughs, high pitched and slightly psychotic sounding. \u201cGreat, now attack me. I need to look hurt.\u201d\nOh,  that  Katara can do.\u00a0\nThe princess was technically speaking to her brother, so she isn\u2019t even properly braced for the wall of water that knocks her over. She doesn\u2019t fight back, allowing Katara to give her some impressive bruises.\u00a0\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Zuko shouts, moving to protect his sister. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, she\u2019s hurt.\u201d\nThe princess coughs out water. \u201cPerfect. Now follow me, Zuzu. We\u2019re going on a merry chase.\u201d\nShe runs and Zuko follows. Streams of blue and yellow-gold fade in their wake.\nAppa really isn\u2019t going into the tunnel.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need to split up,\u201d Sokka points out, already looking filthy and exhausted.\u00a0\n\u201cNo!\u201d Katara objects. \u201cWe all just found each other, we can\u2019t split up now!\u201d\nDad looks over at her, and he has that expression on his face again - the one he had when he first left them for the war. \u201cWe\u2019ll find each other again, Katara,\u201d he promises, folding her into his arms. \u201cWe will.\u201d\u00a0\nKatara is furious in so many directions. This is so unfair.\u00a0\nShe watches her father lead the children through the tunnel, and then turns back to her team.\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Aang insists, pulling Appa from the tunnel to the doors.\nOutside, the royal siblings are fighting.\nThey\u2019re doing a pretty good job of making it look real. The princess looks crazed, hair loose and wild, but Katara has seen them fight. She sees that they\u2019re both being careful, that they\u2019re somehow telegraphing their moves even if she can\u2019t figure out how. She steps forward to block the princess\u2019s blue flames with water, and then drags Zuko backwards onto Appa.\nTo their audience, it will look like the princess has fought her way to freedom, and the team were too distracted with survival to subdue her again. It will have to do.\u00a0\nThey fly away from the danger. Katara glares at Zuko. If it hadn\u2019t been for him deciding to bring his awful sister along, she might still have her father.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatara cannot bring herself to forgive Zuko for anything. And then, in one fell swoop, she can.\u00a0\nShe learns a lot in her days alone with Zuko, even though they barely talk about anything but the mission. She learns that Zuko is quieter without his sister, or perhaps subdued because he\u2019s concerned about her. She learns that Zuko\u2019s loyalty and allyship is a very valuable thing to have. And she learns that Aang was right: revenge isn\u2019t a solution.\nKatara isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s going to happen to Zuko\u2019s father. (Will the Fire Princess kill him? Will Zuko?) But more than that, she worries about what will happen to Zuko if his sister betrays them. And when she asks about it, she doesn\u2019t exactly receive a comforting answer.\nIt\u2019s their first night on Ember Island, hiding in plain sight at one of Zuko\u2019s family homes, when she asks: \u201cAre you not worried that your sister was lying about helping us?\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Zuko replies, lighting their campfire. They don\u2019t really need one anymore, not like they used to; they have an actual indoor space to sleep, and it\u2019s warm on Ember Island. But it seems like the group enjoys gathering around a fire. Zuko frowns into his own flames. \u201cDoes this look a little golden to you? Azula seemed to think that my fire was changing colour, but I couldn\u2019t see it. I think I can now?\u201d\nKatara glances. It\u2019s definitely shining golden. \u201cYes,\u201d she answers. \u201cDoes she not lie?\u201d\nZuko breathes a half-laugh. \u201cAzula always lies.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThen how can you trust her? Does she not lie to  you?\u201d It\u2019s not exactly comforting, but at least if the princess has a track record of honesty with her brother, that\u2019s something to rely on.\nZuko looks up at the sky. \u201cNo, she lies to me a lot,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut she usually tells me that she\u2019s lying. If I ask.\u201d\u00a0\nThat is not comforting at all.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey don\u2019t have a timeline. Which means that if Zuko\u2019s sister is on their side (which is still very much up in the air), she won\u2019t know when to expect them. The only decision that was made was \u2018before Sozin\u2019s Comet\u2019, but it\u2019s not much to go on.\u00a0\nKatara\u2019s feelings of dread and anxiety start to become an ever-present undertone. Aang looks conflicted whenever he spends a moment with his own thoughts. Zuko\u2019s temper is bright and biting, but that might just be his baseline personality.\nSokka and Toph seem to be on distraction duty. They insist on an equal amount of training and bonding time, and Katara is both grateful and annoyed by this.\u00a0\nEventually, however, Sokka sobers and reminds them: \u201cWe need to make a move soon.\u201d\nThey\u2019re sitting around a fire again, after a long day of training. They\u2019re comfortable in a way that they have somehow naturally become around one another. Toph is upside down on a rock, her hair brushing the ground and her feet in the air, as if it doesn\u2019t matter that she\u2019s rendered herself blind. Sokka has wedged himself between Suki and Katara and draped an arm around each of them.\u00a0\nAcross from them, Aang and Zuko have been playing with the fire, creating shapes and patterns. Momo is wrapped around Zuko\u2019s neck, his head snuggled into Zuko\u2019s collarbone. It would be pretty adorable if Katara wasn\u2019t constantly confused by the way that animals act around Zuko, who\u2019s prone to spurts of anger that should surely frighten them off. Instead, animals seem weirdly attracted to Zuko. She will never ever admit this, but sometimes, Zuko kind of reminds her of the princesses in the stories that her mother would tell them.\u00a0\n\u201cAre we strong enough?\u201d Suki asks. \u201cWe\u2019re a good team. And if Azula is with us, we\u2019re even stronger. But\u2026\u201d She glances around, and Katara notices that she doesn\u2019t quite make eye contact with Zuko. \u201cBut if she isn\u2019t with us. Or if we get overwhelmed by the guards. We\u2019re just not enough  people.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAzula won\u2019t betray us,\u201d Zuko insists, which is honestly unhelpful. \u201cBut you\u2019re not wrong. We could use all the manpower we can get.\u201d He sits up a little straighter, looking surprisingly regal over the golden fire, even with a flying lemur acting as a scarf. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey find the Dragon of the West. And a lot more support with him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(Katara doesn\u2019t cry when she sees Uncle Iroh embracing Zuko, but it\u2019s close. Zuko has definitely been crying - he\u2019s too pale to disguise it in the slightest - and it reminds Katara of just how young they all are. This war should be fought and won by adults, not children.\nIt\u2019s also good to see someone touch Zuko without him flinching away.\nMuch later, when the plans are set and it\u2019s time for action, Katara holds out her arms in an invitation. It\u2019s one of the most awkward hugs of Katara\u2019s life. Zuko is as tense as a bowstring and doesn\u2019t seem to know how to hug her back properly. But Katara just holds him more firmly, because Zuko is about to risk his life, and if he\u2019s wrong about the princess then it\u2019s going to hurt him in a great variety of ways.\u00a0\n\u201cStay safe,\u201d Katara suggests, pulling away.\u00a0\nZuko half-smiles at her. \u201cI\u2019ll try. You try, too.\u201d\u00a0\nThere are no promises. War is not a place for promises.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe plan is simple in theory, and complicated in practice.\u00a0\nThey infiltrate the palace precisely, up until the moment that the guards figure out what is happening. Then it is a battle outside the throne room. Zuko was intended to be captured first, and when Aang gets to the throne room with Katara and Sokka as his backup, Zuko is already on his knees. There is a guard behind him, half-kneeling, with a blade pressed to Zuko\u2019s pale throat.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re on time, and Toph and Suki will keep any other guards from entering. Katara holds herself back from sighing in relief.\u00a0\nThe other guards in the room raise their swords, ready to strike when prompted. Fire Lord Ozai looks up at them with an almost bored expression.\n\u201cThis is the army you have behind you?\u201d he asks his son. \u201cA group of ill-trained children?\u201d\nZuko may be on his knees, but his head isn\u2019t down. Many guards in the room are knocked out, scattered across the room. Zuko\u2019s swords are lying haphazardly just out of his reach, as if they\u2019ve been knocked from his hands and kicked away. He\u2019s looking a little charred around the edges, too. Katara\u2019s heartbeat picks up, but her heart also swells with pride; he\u2019s done well to get this far. They all have.\u00a0\nThe Fire Princess stands behind the Fire Lord and to one side, her back straight and her head held as high as Zuko\u2019s.\nZuko is silent.\u00a0\n\u201cSpeak!\u201d the Fire Lord snarls. \u201cSpeak for yourself, boy. They might be your last words.\u201d\n\u201cI brought you the Avatar,\u201d Zuko says, voice slow and careful. \u201cThough I suppose not quite the way you asked me to.\u201d\u00a0\nFire Lord Ozai looks over at Aang, and Katara holds out her hands in a defensive posture. Nobody is attacking. The air is almost stiflingly still.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re no match for us,\u201d Fire Lord Ozai tells his son. \u201cEven with your little team of children. We put you on your knees in moments. How long will it take for the rest of these children?\u201d\nKatara almost wants to argue, because it\u2019s clear that Zuko took out most of his father\u2019s personal guards before he was subdued. But ultimately, she knows what she\u2019s waiting for, and she forces herself to be patient. Zuko is the one with a blade to his throat. They need to allow him to be in control.\u00a0\n\u201cEven if you did manage to beat us, your reign will always be in danger,\u201d Zuko snarls. \u201cIt will-- You reign through fear. Ruling through fear never works.\u201d\nKatara keeps her eye on the Fire Princess, because that is her cue. The moment that Azula strikes, Katara needs to take care of the guards. She waits.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, Fire Lord Ozai also turns to Azula in that moment, causing the princess to remain still. \u201cYour brother tries to speak to me of politics,\u201d he scoffs. \u201cAs if he knows anything of ruling. You and I, daughter, shall rule the entire world through fear.\u201d\nPrincess Azula seems frozen. So does Zuko. Where they usually look on the verge of being twins, they currently couldn\u2019t look more different: Zuko on his knees, clothing disheveled, blood smeared across the unburnt half of his face; Azula on her feet at the Fire Lord\u2019s side, clean and pristine, not a hair out of place.\u00a0\n\u201cYou shall rule the world, Father,\u201d Azula replies. \u201cI am but your loyal servant.\u201d\u00a0\nKatara watches the Fire Lord smile. \u201cBut you are mistaken, daughter,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I rise to power over the world as the Phoenix King, you shall take my place at the head of the Fire Nation.\u201d\nKatara\u2019s heart sinks as she watches the Fire Princess\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m going to be Fire Lord?\u201d she asks, sounding as stunned as Katara has ever heard her.\u00a0\nFire Lord Ozai\u2019s smile widens. \u201cA deserved reward for your loyalty, Fire Lord Azula.\u201d\nKatara watches as the princess\u2019s face shifts to match her father\u2019s, smile wide and cruel. She also watches as the princess\u2019s eyes shift to her brother, just for a moment, before she looks away pointedly.\u00a0\nKatara has never felt more foolish in her life. How had she ever started to trust that Zuko\u2019s sister would be loyal to them? How had she let Zuko\u2019s blind faith in his evil sister bleed into her own perspective?\u00a0\n\u201cYes, Father,\u201d says the Fire Princess, soon to be the Fire Lord.\nKatara accepts that they\u2019re on their own.\nAzula misses her cue.\u00a0\nAlso, while Father and the guards have been forcibly reminded that Zuzu is a much more talented swordsman than a firebender (and boy was  that  fun to watch), they seem to be forgetting where his other well of talent lies.\u00a0\nThis is going to get very interesting, very quickly.\u00a0\n\u201cWhere did I go wrong with that one?\u201d Father asks, looking down his nose at Zuko. Zuko is holding himself very still. Father looks to the guard pressing the blade against his throat. \u201cKill the boy. Guards, take down the peasants. The Avatar is mine.\u201d\nAzula\u2019s eyes snap to her brother as soon as Father says  kill the boy , because while there are no cues anymore, there is no more obvious time for Zuzu to remind them all of his other talent.\u00a0\nZuko twists, grips, and tosses the guard over his shoulder. The guard slams to the floor, blade falling to clatter on the stone.\u00a0\nAzula smirks. There\u2019s a reason that she never allows Zuko to be in reach when they spar.\u00a0\nShe blasts fire in her brother\u2019s direction, leading him steadily from the group of guards who are closing in on the water peasants. The waterbender is surprisingly talented for such a young and ill-educated girl, and the sword peasant isn\u2019t completely hopeless, either.\u00a0\nThe Avatar faces off with Father. Azula would quite like to watch and wait for an opening, but she\u2019s busy dodging surprisingly golden flames. They\u2019re brighter now. How sweet.\u00a0\n\u201cHow could you?\u201d Zuko shouts, his voice hoarse and loud over the clashes of swords and fighting.\u00a0\nAzula ducks and rolls, pulling them to a better area of the room. They have a better view from here.\u00a0\nThey fight, hard and fast, blue and gold. Duck, block, shoot, turn, jump--\u00a0\nAt one point, the Avatar shouts in pain, and Zuko looks over at the wrong moment.\u00a0\nAzula\u2019s fire slices by his arm, partially blocked but not enough. Zuko flinches and almost loses his balance.\u00a0\nAzula frowns and throws fire toward the waterbender, just to give herself something to do while Zuko regains his balance. She raises her right eyebrow,  are you okay, and Zuko blinks once in response.\u00a0\nThey fight.\u00a0\nThe Water Tribe peasants take down the remainder of the guards. Azula won\u2019t give them too much credit; Zuko had taken down the majority of them upon entering the room, quick and precise with his swords in a way that he isn\u2019t (yet) in his firebending. He\u2019s softened the ground for them.\u00a0\n(If she were inclined to be impressed, Azula might admit that two children versus a half dozen trained palace guards is significant, especially since they\u2019re working very hard to incapacitate and strike down without killing anyone.)\u00a0\n\u201cIs your fire  sparkling?\u201d Azula asks eventually, incredulous, when the breath has been knocked from her chest by a particularly powerful blast.\u00a0\nZuko hesitates, either because he hasn\u2019t yet noticed that his fire in still in the process of changing colour  and it is very funny, or because he\u2019s giving Azula a moment to catch her breath.\u00a0\n\u201cNo!\u201d Zuko insists, and then pushes golden fire in her direction, which definitely has a sparkling undertone. \u201cShut up,\u201d he adds.\u00a0\nAzula laughs, and then does her best to turn it into a cruel sound, because they are not out of the woods anytime soon.\u00a0\nFather throws the Avatar across the room. The Avatar lands with a pained noise and then pushes himself up, airbending out of Father\u2019s stream of fire. The Avatar rains rock down on Father, and Azula sees her opening.\u00a0\nFather isn\u2019t letting anyone behind him, because he is too intelligent to do that.\u00a0\nAzula steps in and blasts at the waterbender, knocking her back from aiding the Avatar. She stands by her Father\u2019s side, issuing him a layer of protection as the other children attempt to help.\u00a0\nThe Avatar keeps getting up again. Azula isn\u2019t sure if this is physical strength or purely hubris.\u00a0\nAzula blocks attacks from the Water Tribe siblings, which gives her brother room to enter the fight, shooting fire at their Father. Father knocks him back like the petulant child he is, and then turns back to the Avatar.\u00a0\nAzula focuses on the Water Tribe siblings. The waterbender looks completely furious, which is all kinds of wonderful.\u00a0\nZuko gets up and keeps going. Like the Avatar, it might be more about hubris than strength.\u00a0\nHis blast at Father is stronger this time, and Father has to turn his focus to his son, blocking the golden flames and shooting back.\u00a0\nThe Avatar knocks water in Father\u2019s direction and freezes it around his feet. Father melts the ice easily, but it\u2019s another opening for Zuko, who takes it without question.\u00a0\nGolden lightning crackles around Zuko, starting at his hands and then extending to his whole body, and he shifts his stance for an attack.\u00a0\nFather moves into a defensive posture.\nZuko twists his ankle as he prepares to throw the lightning.\nBeside Father, just slightly behind him, Azula pushes the Water Tribe siblings down for long enough to ready herself.\u00a0\nLightning is flung. Father defends against it, but the lightning doesn\u2019t come to him.\u00a0\nIt comes to Azula.\u00a0\nAzula catches it and swiftly redirects.\u00a0\nBlue lightning hits Ozai in the back, and he falls.\u00a0\nThe Avatar follows with his own attack, and Father isn\u2019t getting up anytime soon. Cuffs of rock encase his wrists, forcing his palms against one another. He tries to fling fire with his feet, only to find them encased, too.\u00a0\nFather looks up at Azula, eyes bright with pure fury.\u00a0\n\u201cYou,\u201d he snarls, lightning still zapping through his body, causing him to twitch.\n\u201cMe,\u201d Azula agrees. She looks down her nose at their Father. \u201cIf you\u2019re wondering where you went wrong with  this one,\u201d she says, \u201cit was around about the time that you burnt my brother.\u201d\u00a0\nThe previous Fire Lord glowers at her. \u201cI would have made you Fire Lord,\u201d he growls. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to usurp me for the crown.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI won\u2019t  be  Fire Lord, Father,\u201d Azula informs him. She glances over at her brother, who is looking a little worse for wear, but very much alive. \u201cZuko will.\u201d\u00a0\nFather practically screams at that, which is delightful.\u00a0\n\u201cOver my dead body,\u201d he snaps, and Azula is about to say  well yes, that\u2019s the plan  before Ozai turns to his son and blasts fire from his mouth.\u00a0\nAzula strikes.\u00a0\nFather stops moving. The lightning continues to crackle over his body, but it\u2019s nothing but a body anymore.\nAzula hesitates, and then looks to Zuko, who is still in a blocking position.\u00a0\nFather is dead.\u00a0\n\u201cOops,\u201d Azula says, and then looks to the Avatar. \u201cI really did intend to leave him alive for you.\u201d\nThe Avatar looks spooked. The Water Tribe siblings join them around the body.\n\u201cYou were defending Zuko,\u201d the Avatar says eventually. \u201cI understand.\u201d\u00a0\n You don\u2019t have to make me sound like such a sap, Azula almost says, but then her eyes catch on her brother. He raises his right eyebrow, and she blinks.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Azula asks out loud, because she sees no reason for this to be hidden anymore.\nZuko almost smiles. \u201cIn one piece,\u201d he replies. \u201cWe need to stop the fighting out there. They\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d\u00a0\nAzula nods and goes to leave the room, only to be all but tackled by the Avatar. She stands with both hands up as he hugs her around the waist.\u00a0\n\u201cZuzu,\u201d Azula bites out, \u201cplease get your pet Avatar off of me.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Avatar laughs and lets her go. \u201cI knew you were on our side,\u201d he insists. \u201cI mean, it looked a bit\u2026 questionable for a moment there, but I knew you loved Zuko too much to let anything happen to him!\u201d\u00a0\nAzula glares. The Avatar moves onto hugging Zuko, as if exchanging embraces is normal post-battle etiquette.\u00a0\nThe waterbender approaches. \u201cI\u2019m going to hug you now,\u201d she informs Azula, who assumes a battle posture.\n\u201cTouch me and lose a hand,\u201d she snaps, and the waterbender stops. She shrugs, and then dips into the most sloppy bow that Azula has ever seen. Azula rolls her eyes, and then bows back at what might be a slightly deeper angle than is technically appropriate for royalty to show a peasant.\u00a0\nSince she\u2019s here now, Azula also bows to the waterbender\u2019s brother. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the worst swordfighting I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d she allows.\u00a0\nThe sword peasant laughs and bows back. It\u2019s even worse than his sister\u2019s attempt. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the worst bait-and-switch I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he replies. \u201cBut next time, maybe don\u2019t give us all a heart attack?\u201d\nZuko finally extracts himself from the Avatar\u2019s hold, and is almost knocked over by the Water Tribe siblings. He looks a little dazed.\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s stop the war,\u201d Azula suggests. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMuch later, the children insist on building a campfire. They\u2019re inside, and there\u2019s an actual fireplace in the room, but they stack wood onto the stone floor and all but demand that Zuko share his flame.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re all tired and filthy. The waterbender - Katara - is determined to heal everyone\u2019s wounds with her waterbending powers. At first, Azula refuses, but it eventually seems like her resistance is inevitably futile.\u00a0\nAzula and Zuko keep turning to talk about politics (take advice from the White Lotus, but remember that they\u2019re not in charge of the Fire Nation; the guards will need to be replaced, but we need to do this with good will; let the peasants into the grounds for the coronation). The rest of the group apparently don\u2019t like this, and the dirt child has resorted to throwing pebbles at them whenever they start.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s strange, seeing Zuko with friends. In their childhood, Azula had been the one with friends, and though Ty Lee and Mai are dedicated to Zuko, he\u2019s never been fully comfortable around them. It\u2019s different with this group. He lets them make fun of him, and assumes the best of it; he laughs more openly; he allows them to touch him, even if he can\u2019t quite relax into it.\nAzula decides that they can stay.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe coronation is the next day.\u00a0\nAzula has barely slept, and neither have the rest of the children who won the war. The dirt child, Toph, looks dead on her feet, but Avatar Aang is bouncing with energy, airbending gifting him with bounding steps as they wait for Zuko to reappear. Mai and Ty Lee join them, and Ty Lee expertly draws Aang\u2019s nervous energy into teaching him to walk on his hands.\u00a0\nWhen Zuko enters, he\u2019s dressed in the clothing of a Fire Lord, his topknot bare as he waits to be crowned.\u00a0\n\u201cSo, are you ready to become the Fire Lord?\u201d Ty Lee asks, cheerful.\nZuko lets out a shaking breath. \u201cDoes it make a difference?\u201d\nAzula asks  are you okay  and receives a yes, then a no, and then another yes.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with your face?\u201d Sokka asks.\u00a0\nZuko shakes his head. \u201cA lot has changed this year,\u201d he says, his voice wondering as he looks around at the group.\n\u201cA year ago, I was still in the ice,\u201d Aang points out.\n\u201cWe had never left the South Pole,\u201d Katara says.\u00a0\nAzula thinks this game is ridiculous, but she still adds: \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen you since you were banished.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now we\u2019re all together,\u201d Zuko finishes, and he looks something approaching happy as he glances around at their friends.\u00a0\nMai sighs. \u201cAre we really going to have a sappy friendship moment instead of getting this all over with?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, sappy friendship moment,\u201d Sokka agrees, and then throws himself into a hug with Zuko. Azula glares, because she remembers how the Water Tribe siblings were when Zuko was shirtless, but it doesn\u2019t last long...\u00a0\nBecause the rest of the group seem to decide that this is an appropriate time for some kind of ridiculous hugging pile.\u00a0\n\u201cUgh, get off of me,\u201d Azula insists. \u201cYou\u2019re going to mess up my robes. You\u2019re going to mess up the Fire Lord\u2019s robes!\u201d\n\u201cCome on, Azula, live a little!\u201d Ty Lee insists, and Azula rolls her eyes but, just for a moment, relents.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(They have to fix Zuko\u2019s hair before the coronation.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen they\u2019re outside, looking out to the sea of people, Zuko looks tall and regal and put together. (Azula knows how nervous he is, but everyone else is too far away to notice his hands trembling.)\nZuko gives a speech about restoring honour, age of peace and love, blah blah blah. Azula barely pays attention, because she\u2019s too busy watching him and the crowd. Azula is usually correct, so it\u2019s hardly a surprise that they seem to eat up this whole narrative. The people aren\u2019t just  going to  adore Fire Lord Zuko; they do already.\u00a0\nWhen Zuko kneels to receive his crown, Azula steps forward. It isn\u2019t exactly traditional, but this is the part she\u2019s been waiting for.\u00a0\nAzula calls out: \u201cAll hail Fire Lord Zuko of the Golden Flames!\u201d\u00a0\nThe Fire Lord stands, and the crowd bursts into cheers.\u00a0\nAzula looks to her brother, and smiles, and doesn\u2019t look away.\u00a0\n\u00a0"
