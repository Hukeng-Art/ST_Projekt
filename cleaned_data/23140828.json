    "summary": "<p>After a mishap, Wei Wuxian, Jiang Cheng and Nie Huaisang find themselves stuck in the future. Luckily, everyone is far too preoccupied to pay much attention to them, because apparently there is a wedding happening in the Cloud Recesses that day, between Hanguang-Jun \u2014 whoever that is \u2014 and some guy from Yiling. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s nothing for them to worry about, of course.</p>\n<p>(Or, where time travel occurs, and Wei Wuxian ends up being a guest at his own wedding).</p>",
    "notes": "<p>So, before you start reading, just a quick (and quite important) note \u2014 the future they travel to his an AU - Canon Divergence version of the canon universe. Basically sometime after Jin Ling\u2019s birth, WWX actually gets his act together, and LWJ actually manages to communicate properly, and the confess and decide to get married. And now the Wens are all living at the Cloud Recesses, and Wangxian get to have an amazing wedding with all their family around, because that is what they deserve.</p>\n<p>And THAT is the future where these three will end up in. I nearly wrote this happening post-canon, but then felt sad because most people were dead, and then I realised that it\u2019d just complicate things because WWX would be in MXY\u2019s body. So I just decided to do it this way.</p>\n<p>Also, it just occurred to me, but you guys could probably pretend this is a continuation of my fic \u201cA Broken Heart Fixes Everything\u201d if any of you have read that. Because this would totally work in that universe.</p>\n<p>Anyway, hope you enjoy this! :D</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for reading! Hope you guys enjoyed this. I seriously can't seem to stop myself from writing time travel fics. And also, since I suck at being creative, literally all my time travel ideas amount to 'a weird array brought so and so here'</p>\n<p>Anyway, let me know what you thought! :)</p>",
    "text": "\u201cThis is all your fault.\u201d\n\u201cJiang-xiong, I didn\u2019t know it would do that!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care, this is literally all your fault.\u201d\u00a0\nHonestly, Wei Wuxian agreed with Jiang Cheng wholeheartedly; and with his brother busy berating Nie Huaisang, at least that meant that his attention was far away from Wei Wuxian. After all, while it had undoubtedly been Nie Huaisang who had tried to copy down the array that he'd seen in the book, it had been Wei Wuxian who had stolen the book from the restricted section of the Lan Sect library to begin with.\nOf course, that had been a result of a dare from Nie Huaisang, so maybe they really could put the sole blame on him.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it would do this,\u201d Nie Huaisang complained, pouting slightly. \u201cIt said it was supposed to give us a glimpse of the future!\u201d\n\u201cWell it hasn\u2019t actually done anything, except for throwing us to the other end of the Cloud Recesses, and forcing us to walk back up this whole way.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDo you think it was some sort of transportation talisman?\u201d Wei Wuxian mused out loud. \u201cAnd if so, why hide it away in some dusty old library? Why not actually use it?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI just wanted to see the future,\u201d Nie Huaisang said, his shoulders slumped. \u201cThat would have been so cool, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cActually, I\u2019d like to go back to my room and wash all the dirt off my back from falling on my ass.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAww, Jiang Cheng, don\u2019t blame Nie-xiong just because you have terrible balance.\u201d\n\u201cThat thing just threw us on the floor! It just dumped us in some random part of the Cloud Recesses \u2014 I don\u2019t even know the point of that.\u201d\nThey were making their way from one end of the Cloud Recesses (and wow, this was an agonisingly large place) back to their dormitories. The array, which they had all assumed would give them a quick peak into the future \u2014 Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t know how that was supposed to work, and the book didn\u2019t go into much detail, but he assumed it would be something like an illusion, or perhaps do something to their minds \u2014 obviously hadn\u2019t worked. That, or Nie Huaisang had messed the design up, which\u2026honestly, wouldn\u2019t be surprising.\nAll it had done was dump them miles away from their rooms, sprawled on the ground, and wondering what the hell had just happened.\n\u201cReturn that book when we get back to the room,\u201d Jiang Cheng told him. \u201cSeriously, if we get caught with it, they would probably expel all of us \u2014 well you for sure, which might not exactly be a bad thing\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nThe three of them glanced up, and saw an unfamiliar Gusu Lan disciple walking towards them. His eyes roamed over them, frowning slightly.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you doing over here?\u201d he asked. Wei Wuxian opened his mouth to reply that they were guest disciples here, and that they had just happened to be taking a nice, leisurely stroll as far away from their rooms as possible, because there nothing strange about that. The man\u2019s eyes flickered briefly over all three of them, and then he seemed to focus on Jiang Cheng for a moment. \u201cAhh, you\u2019re here for the wedding, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re quite early.\u201d\n\u201cThe wedding?\u201d Jiang Cheng repeated.\n\u201cHanguang-Jun and the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s!\u201d\nThey all stared blankly.\u00a0\nThe man huffed. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s best you don\u2019t scatter yourself this far away from everyone else. One wedding, and the whole place is already in complete chaos\u2026\u201d\nWei Wuxian glanced around at the quiet, serene surroundings of the Cloud Recesses, and decided that this man needed to make a trip to Yunmeng if he thought that this was chaos.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be going then,\u201d Nie Huaisang said quickly. The three of them walked off, all exchanging glances.\u00a0\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s getting married?\u201d Jiang Cheng murmured. \u201cI don\u2019t remember hearing about that. Who did he say again? Hanguang-Jun? It\u2019s obviously a title, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard of anyone with that name. And who was the other person?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSome guy from Yiling. It\u2019s really not important,\u201d Wei Wuxian said dismissively. \u201cWho cares if there\u2019s a wedding? It'll probably be as boring as the rest of this place.\" His eyes suddenly lit up. \"Hey, do you think they\u2019d give us the afternoon off from classes if there\u2019s a wedding here?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt is rather strange, though,\u201d Nie Huaisang said, looking slightly contemplative. \u201cIt\u2019s not often that they hold weddings here, and if they do, it\u2019d probably be for a member of the main family.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s highly unlikely, since the only members of the main family eligible for marriage are Lan Xichen and Lan Wangji.\u201d\nWei Wuxian let out a loud snort of laughter. Lan Zhan, getting married? Even the thought was ridiculous. Somehow, he simply could not imagine Lan Wangji getting dressed up in red, and bowing down to some pretty young maiden\u2026no, he was more likely to become a monk.\n\u201cIt must be his brother then,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, remembering the First Jade of Lan. He had looked so much like Lan Wangji it was almost disorientating.\n\u201cXichen-ge isn\u2019t getting married,\u201d Nie Huaisang argued. \u201cMy brother is a close friend of his, surely he would have said something! And anyway, I don\u2019t know who Hanguang-Jun is\u2026\u201d\nJiang Cheng let out a groan, and picked up his pace. \u201cDoes it really matter? Let\u2019s just go back to our rooms. We have classes soon, and Teacher Lan already hates Wei Wuxian enough.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nThey walked in silence for a while. The quiet was only exacerbated by the overall stillness of the Cloud Recesses, and Wei Wuxian found himself itching to say something. He opened his mouth, and then his words trailed off as a familiar voice reached his ears.\n\u201cDo you think we could try that book again?\u201d Nie Huaisang mused aloud. \u201cPerhaps I made a mistake and that\u2019s why it didn\u2019t work\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d Jiang Cheng snapped. \u201cSeriously, just leave that thing alone. Or otherwise, try it again when I\u2019m not around!\u201d\n\u201cOh, but Jiang-xiong, what if I do something wrong? I don\u2019t want to try it by myself!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cJust take Wei Wuxian with you, he\u2019s always doing stupid stuff anyway\u2026\u201d\nAs they bickered amongst themselves, neither Jiang Cheng nor Nie Huaisang seemed to notice that Wei Wuxian had separated from them. They continued to walk forward, while Wei Wuxian dashed quickly in the opposite direction. They were close enough to the main part of the Cloud Recesses now, and it wasn\u2019t like he was overly worried about being late to classes. Lan Qiren already hated him. He had heard a very familiar voice though, and he wasn\u2019t leaving until he had confirmed that he wasn\u2019t imagining things.\nAlthough, if he really had heard what he thought he had, then he couldn\u2019t for the life of him figure out why his Shijie would be here.\u00a0\nHe rounded the corner, hiding behind a nearby bush. There was a woman standing a short distance away, something cradled in her arms. She was draped in rich gold fabrics, and it took Wei Wuxian a moment to realise that this was Jiang Yanli. He stood still, his lips parted in shock, as his sister giggled and cooed at the thing she was holding.\nWhat was going on? Wei Wuxian opened his mouth to call out to her, but then another voice drifted over, and then there was the Peacock, marching over in all his pompous glory.\nThey were wearing the same colours, Wei Wuxian realised with a start. His sister was wearing the colours of the Jin Sect.\u00a0\nYes, he really didn\u2019t like this at all.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019re actually getting married,\u201d Jin Zixuan said.\u00a0\n\u201cYou say that as if you were expecting this,\u201d Jiang Yanli shot back, her voice light and teasing. Wei Wuxian had never heard her sound so comfortable around him before. He knew his Shijie had feelings for the Peacock, but she had always been so shy and nervous around him. It had always made Wei Wuxian so angry, because his sister should never have to watch herself around anyone. Shijie deserved the world.\nJin Zixuan snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t even think that they were expecting this.\u201d\nHow were they suddenly so familiar with each other? And how did they know these people? He was pretty sure that Jiang Yanli had never mentioned having any friends from Yiling, and he had never even heard of a 'Hanguang-Jun' before. And he had read Jiang Yanli\u2019s most recent letter to him, and she hadn\u2019t mentioned anything about attending a wedding. Surely she would have asked to meet with him and Jiang Cheng if she was visiting.\nHe was so preoccupied with these thoughts, that it took him an almost embarrassing amount of time to realise that there was something very off about this picture, more so than just the sight of the Peacock acting overly familiar with his sister. When he finally realised what it was, it took him another moment to convince himself that he wasn\u2019t hallucinating.\nBoth Jiang Yanli and Jin Zixuan looked older. They had to be in their twenties, perhaps early to mid; and that was impossible, because they were both still teenagers. His Shijie was only two years older than him, and he had seen her just a few months ago before leaving for the Cloud Recesses. There was no way she could have possibly changed this much in only a few months.\nJiang Yanli peered down at the thing bundled in her arms, and smiled gently. Beside her, Jin Zixuan eyes shone with utter adoration.\nNo, not a thing. A person. A baby.\nHis sister was holding a baby, and she was dressed like a Jin, and she looked older, and Jin Zixuan had just wrapped his arms around his Shijie, and how DARE he do that?!\u2019\u00a0\nHe was about to storm over, and \u2014 and he wasn\u2019t quite sure what he would do yet, but it would probably end with the Peacock on the floor nursing some sort of broken bone. He would deserve it, because just who had given him permission to touch his Shijie?!\nBut then the full implications of the current situation hit him, and he remembered the actual function of the array that Nie Huaisang had supposedly messed up. A peak into the future\u2026\n\u2026Well, perhaps it had given them more than just a little peak.\nAs he stared at these older, horrifically domestic versions of his Shijie and the Peacock, as Jin Zixuan leaned over to give her a kiss on the cheek, and Wei Wuxian felt bile building up in his throat, he realised that this was very, very bad.\n\u2026\nIt took Jiang Cheng and Nie Huaisang a while to realise that Wei Wuxian was no longer with them. The two exchanged exasperated glances, and tried looking around for him.\n\u201cThat idiot,\u201d Jiang Cheng grumbled, when it was clear that there was no one nearby. \u201cHe\u2019s really pushing it, isn\u2019t he? We\u2019re going to be late to classes as it is.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Wei-xiong really cares about getting in trouble,\u201d Nie Huaisang pointed out.\n\u201cYes, but really, he should realise that it reflects badly on our Sect! He\u2019s our Head Disciple\u2026\u201d Jiang Cheng shook his head, and let out an annoyed huff. \u201cAnyway, it doesn\u2019t matter. Let\u2019s just start making our way back, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll catch up soon enough.\u201d\u00a0\nOr he wouldn\u2019t, and Lan Qiren would throw a fit and make Wei Wuxian spend even more time in the Library Pavilion with Lan Wangji. Honestly, as much as much as Wei Wuxian whined and carried on, Jiang Cheng suspected that he genuinely enjoyed the time he spent with the younger Lan. And Lan Wangji looked like a blank wall on a good day, so it was hard to tell if he was suffering or not.\u00a0\nThe two of them continued to walk for a while longer, drifting closer to the edge of the forest that bordered the Cloud Recesses. They were closer to the main part of the Cloud Recesses now, and they recognised where they were. They had expected the place to be as quiet as usual, especially since classes would still be going on, and yet there seemed to be a considerable amount of people bustling around, and looking more frazzled than either of them had ever seen anyone from Gusu look.\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s for the wedding,\u201d Nie Huaisang said, though he still sounded confused. If it was for the wedding, why make such a big deal for two people that neither of them had even heard of before?\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did he say their names were, again?\u201d Jiang Cheng asked, his brow furrowed. \u201cHanguang-Jun and\u2026the Yiling Matriarch?\u201d\n\u201cPatriarch,\u201d Nie Huaisang interjected. \u201cIt\u2019s a man, I think.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, they\u2019re cut-sleeves?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI guess so\u2026\u201d\nThe two exchanged bewildered glances. Honestly, how had they not heard about a huge wedding held in the Cloud Recesses for a pair of cut-sleeves? Surely the news would have been all over Gusu if that were the case.\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Jiang Cheng groaned at last, running a hand through his hair. \u201cThis has nothing to do with me.\u201d\nNie Huaisang pouted slightly. Unlike his friend, he would very much like to know more about this. Perhaps even sneak into the wedding, because who didn\u2019t love a good celebration? Though he was hardly dressed for it, he supposed.\nThe two of them were mostly ignored, with everyone too busy to pay much attention to two random guest disciples. They rounded the corner, and caught sight of a young child, giggling as he sat on the grass and cuddled a small rabbit close to his chest.\nBoth Nie Huaisang and Jiang Cheng came to abrupt stop, and stared. It wasn\u2019t that there weren\u2019t any children in the Cloud Recesses \u2014 obviously the younger disciples had to come from somewhere \u2014 but they were kept in a separate area, and neither had really seen any of them roaming around.\u00a0\nThe child was dressed in a fancier version if the typical Gusu Lan clothing, most likely because of the wedding. He wasn\u2019t wearing a forehead ribbon, but that was most likely because of his young age; the child couldn\u2019t have been older than three or four.\nThe child placed the rabbit on the floor, and giggled loudly when the little animal hopped back over to him. He was the most liveliest thing they had ever seen in the Gusu Lan clothes, that was for sure. The child glanced up, and his eyes widened when he caught sight of them. Swiftly, he scooped the rabbit up in his arms, and toddled over.\n\u201cGrumpy Uncle!\u201d he cried, coming to a stop beside a startled Jiang Cheng. \u201cGrumpy Uncle, look, my bunny!\u201d\nJiang Cheng gaped. Nie Huaisang let out a snort of laughter.\n\u201cUh\u2026look kid, I\u2019m not \u2014 I think you have the wrong person here\u2026\u201d He shot Nie Huaisang a furious glare when it didn\u2019t look like he was going to stop laughing.\nThe child lowered the bunny, and pouted. \u201cGrumpy Uncle doesn\u2019t want to see A-Yuan?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not Grumpy Uncle!\u201d\nThe child \u2014 A-Yuan \u2014 cocked his head to the side, frowning slightly. \u201cNot\u2026Grumpy Uncle?\u201d\nJiang Cheng shot his head vehemently, his cheeks red.\nThe child hugged the rabbit to his chest, his lower lip sticking out in an exaggerated pout. \u201cOkay then.\u201d He shuffled closer. Jiang Cheng backed away. \u201cYou\u2019re purple like Grumpy Uncle.\u201d\nJiang Cheng\u2019s eye twitched. God, he really didn\u2019t know how to handle children.\nNie Huaisang crouched down, smiling. \u201cLots of people wear purple,\u201d he told A-Yuan. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got some really nice clothes yourself!\u201d\nThe child puffed his chest out, looking proud. \u201cA-Die got them for me,\u201d he said. \u201cFor A-Die and A-Niang\u2019s wedding!\u201d\nNie Huaisang blinked. \u201cYou mean\u2026the wedding today?\u201d\nThe child nodded, beaming widely. \u201cYes! A-Niang is marrying A-Die, and A-Yuan and everyone is going to come and live here! And A-Yuan gets to be part of the Gu \u2014 gu \u2014 \u201d His face scrunched up slightly. \u201cThe Gusu Lan Sect!\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds very nice, A-Yuan,\u201d Nie Huaisang said, smiling cordially. Jiang Cheng watched from behind him, eyeing A-Yuan like he was a wild animal, and wondering how the hell Nie Huaisang could talk to the child normally.\n\u201cWait, I thought this was a cut-sleeve wedding,\u201d Jiang Cheng said suddenly.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a cut-sleeve?\u201d A-Yuan asked, looking confused.\n\u201cTwo men, who are in a relationship,\u201d Nie Huaisang told him. Jiang Cheng shot him an irritated glare, because he didn\u2019t want to be standing around explaining how relationships worked to some random kid.\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d A-Yuan said, still looking confused. \u201cA-Die is a man, and A-Niang is a man.\u201d\n\u201cYour A-Niang is a man,\u201d Jiang Cheng repeated flatly.\n\u201cA-Niang is A-Niang! And you look just like Grumpy Uncle!\u201d\nJiang Cheng\u2019s eye twitched. He turned to Nie Huaisang, and yanked on the back of his outer robe. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here long enough.\u201d\n\u201cShould we really leave him here alone?\u201d Nie Huaisang mused.\n\u201cHe obviously lives here. If his parents let him play here alone, he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cI have lots of uncles!\u201d A-Yuan said, beaming excitedly. \u201cUncle Ning, Grumpy Uncle, Goat Uncle, Peacock Uncle, Smiling Uncle \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Jiang Cheng urged.\n\u201c \u2014 Uncle Four, Uncle Five, Uncle Six, Uncle Seven \u2014 Uncle Ning!\u201d And then the child was taking off down the path, the rabbit still clutched in his arms. Jiang Cheng let out a sigh of relief, and tugged Nie Huaisang away. He dragged them closer to the forest\u2019s edge, and ducked behind a tree.\n\u201cAre you seriously hiding from a child right now?\u201d Nie Huaisang asked, amused.\n\u201cHe was driving me insane,\u201d Jiang Cheng snapped. \u201cWhy do children talk so much \u2014 oh god, here he comes again.\u201d\n\u201cI thought he was cute,\u201d Nie Huaisang murmured, his eyes moving back to the place where they had previously been standing. They could hear A-Yuan\u2019s excited chatter, and another voice, quieter and more gentle, accompanying him.\n\u201c \u2014 And I saw someone who looked just like Grumpy Uncle! He even looked really grumpy!\u201d\nJiang Cheng\u2019s eye twitched.\n\u201cA-Yuan,\u201d the other voice said, obviously belonging to an adult, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have run off like that. Look, you\u2019ve got dirt all over your good robes.\u201d\n\u201cBut A-Niang and A-Die have to look pretty today, because everyone wants to see them,\u201d A-Yuan argued. \u201cNo one will be looking at A-Yuan.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but everyone spent so much time making you look nice for today\u2026\u201d\nThey came into view, A-Yuan now happily sitting on the shoulders of his companion, the rabbit perched on the man\u2019s head. And well, the only reason Jiang Cheng and Nie Huaisang didn\u2019t scream in that moment was because of the utter shock they were feeling.\nThe child was perched on the shoulders of a fierce corpse. A talking, completely sentient fierce corpse. A fierce corpse who was carrying out a conversation right now.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Nie Huaisang said, blinking rapidly. \u201cI\u2026oh my god.\u201d\nJiang Cheng shook off his shock, and his hand reached for his sword. \u201cWe need to go and do something,\u201d he said, his voice panicked. \u201cThat stupid kid is just \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve time travelled!\u201d\u00a0\n\nJiang Cheng and Nie Huaisang both whirled around, looks of alarm on their faces. Jiang Cheng came close to whipping out his sword, and shot Wei Wuxian a furious look when he saw that it was he who had come up behind them.\n\u201cGuys, you won\u2019t believe what I just saw!\u201d Wei Wuxian cried, his eyes wide. \u201cShijie and the Peacock were here, and \u2014 oh my god, what is that?!\u201d\u00a0\nNie Huaisang slammed a hand over Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth. \u201cShh!\u201d he hissed. \u201cHe might hear us!\u201d He \u00a0was so relieved that Jiang Cheng had dragged them to a hiding spot before they had shown up.\n\u201cWhy is there a child sitting on a fierce corpse\u2019s shoulders?\u201d Wei Wuxian demanded, panic in his gaze. \u201cAnd \u2014 wait, is it\u2026is it talking?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cA-Yuan, your rabbit is very cute,\u201d he fierce corpse said, his voice gentle. The three of them gaped.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, what the fuck.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, okay,\u201d Jiang Cheng hissed. His hand was still hovering over his sword, but most of this alarm had been replaced with confusion. It didn\u2019t look like the corpse was actually going to do anything. \u201cThat child just showed up, and god it was annoying and then \u2014 and then that thing showed up. I don\u2019t even know what to call it.\u201d\nThey shot another glance back. The corpse had yet to notice them, still chatting softly to the child. They could hear the sound of another voice arriving, female this time,\n\u201cA-Yuan! There you are! A-Ning, bring him here \u2014 look at your clothes, A-Yuan! You\u2019re a mess!\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to play with my bunny!\u201d A-Yuan said, cuddling it close. \u201cLook how cute it is!\u201d\nA woman came into view, her arms perched on her hips, a stern expression on her face. \u201cYou need to go and get changed,\u201d she told him, her voice firm. She turned to the corpse, and started talking to it as if it was the most normal thing in the world to do.\n\u201cA-Ning, have you seen that idiot anywhere? I think he\u2019s tried to sneak out to see Hanguang-Jun again.\u201d\nThe fierce corpse blinked. \u201cIs he dressed yet?\u201d\n\u201cHow should I know?! And now his brother is running all over the place trying to find him \u2014 honestly, they\u2019re getting married today, I don\u2019t see why they can\u2019t spend a few hours apart.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve barely been able to stay apart since they got engaged,\u201d the corpse said. \u201cI\u2019m just glad they\u2019re happy.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you are. A-Yuan, come on, let\u2019s get you cleaned up\u2026\u201d\nTheir voices drifted off as they walked away. Jiang Cheng, Wei Wuxian and Nie Huaisang stood where they were, still gaping.\n\u201cOkay, what the hell,\u201d Wei Wuxian said at last, his voice slightly weak. \u201cThat \u2014 why was there a talking fierce corpse? Is that supposed to be a normal thing here?\u201d\n\u201cHere?\u201d Nie Huaisang repeated, sounding confused. \u201cDo you mean in Gusu? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a normal thing anywhere, Wei-xiong.\u201d\n\u201cNo, not\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian shook his head, and made a quick gesture with his hand for his friends to follow him. \u201cCome on. I need to talk to you guys about something, and we really shouldn\u2019t be standing around here in case someone sees us.\u201d\n\u2026\nWei Wuxian dragged them over to a nearby building, his eyes flickering around rapidly, nervous about being seen by other people.\n\u201cYou\u2019re suddenly very concerned about being caught,\u201d Jiang Cheng said flatly, as he walked at a hurried pace to keep up.\u00a0\n\u201cIn here,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, pointing to a set of large doors. The three of them walked inside, and closed the doors behind them. They found themselves in a large hall, very elaborately decorated for a place in the Lan Sect. Rows of chairs had been laid out, and long tables stretched across the room.\n\u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d Jiang Cheng asked, looking around.\n\u201cHere? No idea. This was the closest place that I could find.\u201d Wei Wuxian walked over and threw himself onto one of the chairs. \u201cWe can\u2019t let anyone see us.\u201d\nJiang Cheng ran a hand through his hair, looking slightly frustrated. \u201cWhy? What exactly is happening here, because this has been a very strange day.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain that we\u2019ve time traveled.\u201d\nNie Huaisang and Jiang Cheng both stared at him.\n\u201c\u2026Very funny, Wei-xiong,\u201d Nie Huaisang said at last. \u201cReally though, what do you think is happening around here? Should we maybe\u2026tell someone about that fierce corpse we saw?\u201d He sounded slightly nervous as he said it.\n\u201cNo, really! Hear me out! So, that array you copied out \u2014 what if it actually transported us to the future?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, you figured all of that out on your own?\u201d Jiang Cheng asked, rolling his eyes. \u201cThe only thing that stupid thing did was toss us to the opposite end of the Cloud Recesses.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Wuxian agreed, \u201cand suddenly all of this strange stuff is happening. Some big Lan guy who we\u2019ve never heard of before is getting married, there\u2019s a talking fierce corpse and everyone is acting like that\u2019s somehow normal, and, oh, Shijie and the Peacock are just casually hanging around with a baby in their arms.\u201d\nJiang Cheng let out a loud splutter, his eyes wide. \u201cWhat did you saw about A-Jie?!\u201d\n\u201cShe was with the Peacock! And they both looked old, like they were maybe in their twenties \u2014 and Shijie was holding this baby, and they were both just cooing at it, and looking all gross and \u2014 and the Peacock was being way too familiar with her!\u201d\n\u201cDid you punch him?!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSo not the point here, but no, even though I definitely thought about it.\u201d\n\u201cImagine if we really have traveled to the future,\u201d Nie Huaisang murmured, sounding slightly awed. \u201cI could go and meet my future self! Maybe I\u2019m even married\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI am never getting married,\u201d Wei Wuxian declared. \u201cAnd no, we can\u2019t let anyone see us \u2014 we could accidentally mess up the timeline. We need to make sure no one sees us\u2026ugh, I can\u2019t believe Shijie had a baby with the Peacock.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe it isn\u2019t her baby,\u201d Jiang Cheng said quickly. \u201cMaybe\u2026maybe she was just holding it for someone.\u201d\n\u201cShe was wearing Jin Sect colours, Jiang Cheng.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe she just really likes gold!\u201d\nNie Huaisang frowned slightly. \u201cIsn\u2019t your sister engaged to him?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou knew she would marry him someday.\u201d\n\u201cI try not to think about it too much,\u201d Jiang Cheng muttered.\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m hoping Shijie realises that she\u2019s way too good for him,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, his shoulders hunched. \u201cUgh, I can\u2019t believe she actually marries him.\u201d\n\u201cWell, maybe they aren\u2019t married.\u201d\n\u201cNie-xiong, just what are you insinuating about our sister?!\u201d\n\u201cNothing, nothing!\u201d\nThey all sat around for a while, lost in their own thoughts. Really, this was all a huge mess. Jiang Cheng was still sceptical, though Nie Huaisang and Wei Wuxian were fully on board with the idea of time travel. Of course, that brought up the dilemma of how they were going to get home, something no one really had an answer for.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get expelled for stealing that book,\u201d Jiang Cheng said flatly. \u201cI knew this was a bad idea! And say that you\u2019re right here \u2014 and I\u2019m not saying you are, because this all sounds like some big prank that you\u2019ve come up with \u2014 how exactly are we going to get home again?!\u201d\n\u201cHmm, I guess we could try and steal the book again?\u201d Wei Wuxian mused, his chin resting on his palm, and his legs swinging back and forth. \u201cOr maybe this would even wear off on it\u2019s own \u2014 \u201d\nThey all jumped when they heard the sudden sound of voices from outside of the room. They exchanged wide-eyed, alarmed glances.\n\u201cOver there!\u201d Wei Wuxian whispered, jumping to his feet. The three of them hurried to the end of the room, and ducked under a table at the back of the room. They huddled under it, mostly hidden by the long table cloth that covered it.\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Jiang Cheng muttered, glaring. \u201cJust great.\u201d\nThe door opened, and the sound of footsteps filled the empty room. Wei Wuxian, Nie Huaisang and Jiang Cheng shuffled forward, trying to get a better look while still remaining out of sight. Lan Qiren stood a short distance away from them, accompanied by another man who they soon recognised as the First Jade of Lan.\n\u201c \u2014 and he\u2019s gone and snuck out again. Does he have no shame!? Xichen, this man is marrying into our sect - we\u2019ll be the embarrassments of the cultivation world!\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cUncle, calm down.\u201d Lan Xichen sounded amused. \u201cHe is simply enthusiastic.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting married soon! Why can\u2019t they just wait?!\u201d\n\u201cWell \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t just mean today! I \u2014 I have honestly had enough. They can\u2019t even put up silencing charms at night!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cUncle, I\u2019d rather we don\u2019t talk about this right now\u2026this is supposed to be a happy day.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Jiang Cheng murmured.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is not a happy day, Xichen! This is a nightmare! My nightmare! Please send him back to the Burial Mounds, the two of us simply cannot coexist in the same place!\u201d\n\u201cUncle, really, now you\u2019re being overly dramatic\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe Burial Mounds?\u201d Wei Wuxian repeated incredulously. \u201cHow much does he hate this person?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cKeep your voice down or they\u2019ll hear us!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m being quiet, okay?!\u201d\nLan Qiren and Lan Xichen continued to chat between themselves, oblivious to the three teenagers hiding at the back of the room. Jiang Cheng, Wei Wuxian and Nie Huaisang all settled in their places, waiting for them to leave so that they could get the hell out of there.\nExcept\u2026they didn\u2019t leave. They stayed where they were, Lan Qiren looking like he wanted to kill someone (or himself) and Lan Xichen looking like he was incredibly happy, but trying to look sympathetic for his uncle\u2019s sake.\nAnd then more guests started pouring in. People that they had never seen before, and then other people who they definitely knew very well. They were barely able to hide their shock when Jiang Yanli stepped into the room, a small bundle cradled in her arms.\n\u201cI told you so!\u201d Wei Wuxian whispered to Jiang Cheng, whose horrified gaze was trained on the man who had just wrapped an arm around their sister's waist.\n\u201cWhy is he touching her like that?\u201d Jiang Cheng demanded, glaring at an oblivious Jin Zixuan.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re married,\u201d Nie Huaisang said.\n\u201cShut up!\u201d\u00a0\nThe door opened again, and in came the fierce corpse. A woman walked beside him, A-Yuan perched in her arms. As the three of them watched the scene with incredulous eyes. It was obvious that no one else seemed to find this remotely strange. The corpse received a few wary looks from the people around him, but no one seemed to object to his presence, or have any sort of normal reaction, like trying to destroy him.\nBasically, it was very, very strange.\u00a0\n\u201cA-Qing! A-Ning!\u201d Jiang Yanli said, walking over with a beaming smile on her face. She then proceeded to hug the woman, and then hugged the corpse, as if it were a perfectly normal thing to do. She did so while still holding her little baby in her arms, not even caring that it was a few inches away from a fierce corpse. The three of them gaped.\u00a0\nA-Yuan pouted. \u201cAnd A-Yuan!\u201d\nJiang Yanli laughed. \u201cYes, and A-Yuan! You\u2019re looking lovely today, aren\u2019t you!\u201d\n\u201cMm!\u201d A-Yuan said, nodding quickly. \u201cWant to look pretty for A-Niang and A-Die!\u201d\n\u201cAnd how is Jin Ling?\u201d The other woman asked, her eyes focused on the baby.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s well,\u201d Jiang Yanli said, smiling down at the child who Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian, much to their displeasure, had realised was almost certainly her child. \u201cHe\u2019s still quite fussy at night, but I suppose they all go through that phase.\u201d\n\u201cMakes sense that he\u2019d be a bit spoiled considering who his father is.\u201d\n\u201cOh my fucking god,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispered, while Jiang Cheng\u2019s eyes bugged out.\n\u201cA-Cheng!\u201d Jiang Yanli said, her smile growing as she turned to the man that had just walked over. Standing there, decked in the purple robes of the Jiang Sect, was an older versipon of Jiang Cheng. \u201cThere you are! I was looking for you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Jiang Cheng said, his eyes still wide with shock. \u201cI \u2014 oh my god, that\u2019s me.\u201d\n\u201cI told you we had time travelled,\u201d Wei Wuxian said smugly.\u00a0\n\u201cGrumpy Uncle!\u201d A-Yuan cried, reaching out excitedly. Older Jiang Cheng let out an amused huff, and reached out to take the child into his arms.\n\u201cOh my god, you are Grumpy Uncle,\u201d Nie Huaisang said, sounding delighted. Jiang Cheng was too busy staring in shock at the scene in front of him to even express any annoyance at that.\u00a0\nThey continued to look around the room, taking in everything that was happening.\u00a0\n\u201cLook over there!\u201d Nie Huaisang cried, pointing. His friends were too preoccupied with the occupants of the rapidly filling room to tell him to be more discrete. \u201cThat\u2019s me! And Da-ge!\u201d\nYes, towards the other end of the room stood an older Nie Huaisang, who had obviously used this wedding as an excuse to get dressed up. He was chatting with Nie Mingjue and Lan Xichen. Nie Huaisang\u2019s eyes widened in delight, and he leaned forward, excitedly studying every detail of his future self.\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Wei Wuxian said, his voice slightly indignant. \u201cWhere am I? Seriously, was I the only person not invited to this thing?!\u201d\nHis eyes flickered around the room, but as time passed, it became evident that his future self was nowhere in sight. He pouted. That was so unfair. Even the Peacock was here, now standing disgustedly close to his precious Shijie again. Jiang Cheng\u2019s future self was talking to the Peacock and actually looking comfortable while doing it.\n\u2018Traitor,\u2019 Wei Wuxian thought.\nThe guests all drifted over and started to take their seats. The three friends huddled in their hiding place, and resigned themselves to the fact that they wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere anytime soon.\u00a0\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t find him,\u201d older Jiang Cheng was telling to Jiang Yanli, with some annoyance in his voice. \u201cSeriously, that idiot needs to stop sneaking out everywhere. I just hope he actually got dressed, or he\u2019s going to be late to his own wedding.\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Yanli giggled. \u201cOh A-Cheng, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine. A-Yuan, come on, your parents will be coming soon.\u201d\nThe child let out an excited cry, bouncing slightly in Jiang Cheng\u2019s arms.\u00a0\n\u201cI wonder who\u2019s getting married?\u201d Nie Huaisang mused, looking around the room. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be someone from the main family of the Lan Sect\u2026wait, I can\u2019t see Second Master Lan anywhere here.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan? You think Lan Zhan is getting married?\u201d Wei Wuxian let out a surprised laugh. \u201cAs if that would ever happen! No, it\u2019s probably someone else\u2026\u201d\nAnd then the doors opened, and the grooms walked in. Both were draped in red, and both looked magnificent, but Wei Wuxian found his eyes drawn to the one standing on the left. Tall, broad-shouldered and muscular, and somehow even more handsome with the years that had passed. Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t even thought that was possible, and yet here Lan Wangji was, looking like a god straight out of the Heavens. He barely registered that his jaw was hanging open.\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d he murmured, watching as Lan Wangji ducked his head slightly, a soft look in his eyes as he watched his companion. Wei Wuxian had never seen Lan Wangji look at anyone like that. Certainly not him. Not that he cared if Lan Wangji looked at him like that, but he did consider the other boy a friend, and Lan Zhan didn\u2019t really seem to like him very much most of the time\u2026\n\u201cOh my fucking god,\u201d Jiang Cheng said, sounding a mix of shocked and horrified.\n\u201cI know, right?\u201d Wei Wuxian said, because obviously Jiang Cheng was acknowledging how mind-numbingly beautiful Lan Wangji looked right now.\n\u201cThis is happening, right?\u201d Jiang Cheng choked. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing this, right?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing this,\u201d Nie Huaisang said, sounding way too excited.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely seeing this,\u201d Wei Wuxian agreed, his eyes still glued to Lan Wangji. The gold accents on his wedding robes brought out the gold in his eyes, and oh, he looked amazing. Wei Wuxian felt something clench in his chest, and he wasn\u2019t sure why.\u00a0\n\u201cSince when were you a cut-sleeve?!\u201d Jiang Cheng demanded, his voice slightly hysteric.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s head whipped around. \u201cI\u2019m not a cut-sleeve!\u201d\n\u201cThen how do you explain that?!\u201d\nWei Wuxian frowned in confusion, and turned back to where Lan Wangji was standing. All he could see was Lan Wangji, looking utterly amazing as he made his way to the front of the room, and the guy he was marrying, who Wei Wuxian realised he still didn\u2019t know. Who could possibly be worthy of Lan Zhan? His eyes flickered to the man, taking in the striking red of his robes, his elaborate hair and beaming smile, and felt his heart clench painfully.\nHe didn\u2019t know why. He should be happy, if Lan Zhan had found someone he loved enough to marry. Someone he loved enough to look at with that look in his eyes. He didn\u2019t know why he felt like there was a lump in his chest, or why there were tears stinging his eyes.\n\u201cHe looks so beautiful,\u201d Wei Wuxian muttered bitterly, his eyes glued to Lan Wangji\u2019s soon-to-be-husband.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng turned to him, his expression slightly incredulous. \u201cJust how vain are you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou \u2014 \u201d Jiang Cheng\u2019s jaw dropped open. \u201cYou do know that\u2019s you, right?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes snapped back to where the couple were now making their way to the front of the room. Lan Wangji\u2019s companion, what\u2019s-his-name-from-Yiling looked handsome and elegant, his hair pulled up in an elaborate up-do, his robes making him look rich and sophisticated in a way that Wei Wuxian, with his messy locks and plain black clothes, had never been able to pull off. And maybe that was why he hadn\u2019t recognised himself in the person standing beside Lan Wangji, gazing back at the man with a look of utter adoration in his eyes.\nBut here he was, walking side-by-side with a man who looked like the closest thing to a god that Wei Wuxian had ever seen. Wei Wuxian felt his heart beat wildly, felt his mouth dry, and his cheeks heat up, as he realised, \u2018Oh my god, that\u2019s me. I\u2019m marrying Lan Zhan.\u2019\u00a0\nHe watched, unable to tear his eyes away, as the wedding proceeded; as his older self and Lan Wangji completed their bows, as they served tea to their families; as the little boy still perched on Older Jiang Cheng\u2019s lap jumped up and down and asked his A-Niang to carry him. Older Wei Wuxian complied with a delighted laugh, holding the boy close despite the admonishing glance Lan Qiren shot him. Lan Wangji leaned closer, tucking a stray strand of hair behind the boy\u2019s ear, his expression gentle.\n\u201cHe called him A-Niang,\u201d Wei Wuxian heard Jiang Cheng mutter, sounding horrified.\nWei Wuxian couldn\u2019t even bring himself to look away from the scene in front of him. Him and Lan Zhan, getting married. Him and Lan Zhan, husbands, with a son, and \u2014 oh god, why did that just sound so nice? Why did he actually want that so badly? He and Lan Zhan were just friends, right?\u00a0\n\nRight?\u00a0\n\n\u201cDoes no one find this the slightest bit weird?!\u201d Jiang Cheng demanded.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Nie Huaisang said, his eyes focused on the scene in front of him. He looked delighted. \u201cNo, not at all. I actually saw this coming.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? How could you possibly have seen this coming?!\u201d\n\u201cWei-xiong is always talking about Lan Wangji.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Lan Wangji hates him!\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026clearly not.\u201d\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t hate me,\u201d Wei Wuxian murmured, a smile tugging at his lips. \u201cHe does want to be my friend.\u201d\nJiang Cheng shot him an incredulous glance, and Nie Huaisang let out an amused sigh.\n\u201cWei-xiong, I think he wants to be a lot more than just friends.\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s smile grew. \u201cI guess he does.\u201d He didn\u2019t know exactly what to think about that, or how to even start to approach it, but\u2026the thought didn\u2019t scare him or make him uncomfortable. Strangely, it seemed almost natural.\nThe wedding continued, and the three of them remained in their hiding spot, waiting for everyone else to leave. Eventually, the newly married couple would walk off to do whatever it was couples did after their wedding (when Wei Wuxian mused about this out loud, Jiang Cheng shot him a withering glance), the guests would taper off, and the the three time travellers would finally be able to leave.\u00a0\nEventually, they would have to figure out how the hell to get out of this place (and luckily, it would turn out that the effects of the array were only temporary, and they would soon be taken home without much effort on their part). And Wei Wuxian would try to sort through the whirlwind of emotions rushing through him, as his thought process turned from, \u2018Lan Zhan is my friend,\u2019 to \u2018Oh my god, I have feelings for Lan Zhan.\u2019\nFor now though, they were still stuck under that table, still trying to process exactly what they were seeing. They would be there for a while.\u00a0"
