    "text": "\nI won\u2019t let you do it. Wen Qing. I won\u2019t let you go to the Jin \u2013\n\n\u00a0\nHis voice. He remembered his own voice. What else had he said?\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d forgotten so much already.\n\u00a0\nHis blood seeped into the soil. He kept on drawing the array, carefully, fleshing it with his own soul \u2013 not his spiritual energy (there was none in him to give; why? He\u2019d known, once) but all the scraps of worth he had left inside him.\n\u00a0\nThere were cultivators coming. He could feel them. He didn\u2019t have long. Behind him, Wen Ning stood entirely still, head bowed. Grieving.\n\u00a0\nSacrifice is the oldest kind of magic. That was his own voice too. The echo of it clung to him, even as the rest of him seeped away: his memories. Lotus Pier. Shijie in her wedding clothes. Jin Zixuan\u2019s blood. A gift for a child. Promises broken. His own howling grief.\n\u00a0\nHimself.\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve already lost everything. For you, for Wen Ning, for the others \u2013\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe bit down on his tongue. Tasted blood. Leaned forward. Kissed the soil. And mouthed his name one last time.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI can sacrifice one more thing.\n\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nThe Yiling Patriarch woke on the edge of the Burial Mounds. A man who was dead and walking held him up, an arm around the Patriarch\u2019s shoulders. The Patriarch coughed. Spat blood on the ground. Looked up.\n\u00a0\nThe wards were holding strong, pulsing with resentful energy. He spat again, clearing the blood from his mouth and said, \u201cTell me your name.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWen Ning, master,\u201d the dead man said eventually. His voice sounded \u2013 strange. Hollow. \u201cCourtesy name Qionglin.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s good to meet you again, Wen Ning!\u201d The Yiling Patriarch kept his voice cheerful. No need to let the monstrous rage coiled in his gut out. Not yet. \u201cGive me a moment, and then we\u2019ll head back, eh?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe dead man gave him a moment. The Patriarch felt the approach of the cultivators. Closed his eyes, and let the rage flare out of him.\n\u00a0\nHe felt it as his wards rose to meet the cultivators \u2013 howling, terrible, a tide laden with the dead \u2013 and shoved them back, back, in a sea of limbs and blood and howling. He nodded to himself, satisfied, and gestured for the dead man Wen Ning to lead the way.\n\u00a0\nThe two of them walked toward a small settlement of homes. There was a lotus pond. A patch of vegetables. The doors of the homes were shut. Only one woman waited for them.\n\u00a0\nThe woman called out a name. The Yiling Patriarch saw her mouth move, and flinched as a sound like a knife struck him about the ears. He clenched a hand over his ears, then lowered them. He was laughing, he realised. Laughing, laughing, because he\u2019d wanted this.\n\u00a0\nThe woman did not laugh. She looked as if she had been weeping.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt worked, then,\u201d she said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo one will be able to hurt you,\u201d the Patriarch agreed.\n\u00a0\nHis bones felt heavy. The malice running through him was a burnt sweetness, syrupy and so thick that it made him sluggish. It wouldn\u2019t slow him down, later. He thought of how watching and feeling the wards work had sated his rage \u2013 left it purring, quiescent and well fed. It would not stay that way for long, and he could not hurt the people here. He had become this for them, after all.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho were you to me, before?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy name is Wen Qing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re \u2013 friends.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI suppose we were, once,\u201d the Patriarch agreed. \u201cNow leave me alone, Wen Qing. Ah, I can understand why you wouldn\u2019t want to,\u201d he went on, when she opened her mouth to protest. \u201cI look handsome, don\u2019t I? But I promise you, I\u2019m not good company anymore! So please make sure everyone avoids me. After all, you should do my old self the favour of staying alive.\u201d\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nNo one could enter the Burial Mounds. Not anymore.\n\u00a0\nMany cultivators tried to break through the wards, after that. The Lanling Jin had deep pockets, and the Jin heir was dead, murdered by the Yiling Patriarch and his Ghost General. The Jin wanted to raze the Wen Remnants to the ground. But any cultivator who tried to enter the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s land was expelled, forced back by resentful energy so thick and strong that it left burns upon their hands and nightmares in their rattling skulls.\n\u00a0\nIf they kept on trying\u2026 well. The rage in the Patriarch\u2019s body had to be fed somehow.\n\u00a0\nTheir deaths brought him a pleasure so sharp it was almost pain. (Perhaps, once, it would have been.) He meditated in his cave, cross-legged, resentful energy wreathed around him, and tore apart bodies with the wards he had built and fed, nourished by his own soul. And then, when he was done, he stood at the entrance of his home and watch the Wen Remnants farm and eat and talk to one another, entirely safe.\n\u00a0\nThey were happy. It was enough.\n\u00a0\nMonths passed. The rage wore his skin. He dreamt of nothing and slept like the dead, in a silence born where his memories had once lived. Sometimes the Wen watched him with sad, worried eyes. There was a child that reached for him, sometimes. He did not reach back, and soon enough it stopped trying. He grew used to his new life.\n\u00a0\nThen it happened.\n\u00a0\nSomeone was at the wards. Not crossing them. Not resisting them. Merely waiting, a gentle animal baring its neck for slaughter. It made the angry hunger in him twist and turn, confused. He closed his eyes and reached, through the wards, for that presence:\n\u00a0\nA man. A cultivator. Not of Lanling Jin. Weaponless. Kneeling.\n\u00a0\nWen Ning came in to speak to him, in that timid voice of his.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaster, there\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d said the Patriarch. \u201cStrange, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ll go deal with him myself.\u201d\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nThe cultivator was kneeling just beyond the wards. His sword lay on the ground far behind him. His hands were flat on the ground, palms up, in a gesture of vulnerability. He had lowered himself into a bow so deep that the back of his throat was bare, his hair spooled on the ground.\n\u00a0\nThe black tide of the wards lapped at the edges of his fingertips and the fine, pale lace of his outer robes. He had not crossed the wards, but the wards had him regardless: held his wrists like manacles, rose like water up his skin. The man carried all the curses the Patriarch had placed upon the wards of the Burial Mounds upon his body. Beneath smoke and red lines of those curses, his clothes were white, his skin pale, his hair deep black.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch raised a hand, banishing those curses away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRaise your head,\u201d said the Patriarch. \u201cLet me see you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man raised his head. The Patriarch\u2019s breath caught. In his chest, his heart clenched.\n\u00a0\nBehind him, he heard Wen Ning make a noise of surprise, and then he knew:\n\u00a0\nThis one had known him before.\n\u00a0\nEven without memory, his body reacted with a kind of knowing yearning, shoulders softening, his skin warming as he drew closer, one footstep at a time.\n\u00a0\nOnce, I wanted you, he thought, looking at the pristine cultivator still kneeling before him. And somehow, my flesh wants you still. Who are you?\n\u00a0\n\u201cHonoured cultivator,\u201d the Patriarch said, keeping his voice genial. Friendly. \u201cHave you come to kill me? We knew each other once, I expect. Did I murder your lover? Your sister?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI came here for you,\u201d the cultivator said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEveryone comes here for me,\u201d said the Patriarch. \u201cWhy do you kneel? And why have you abandoned your sword?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe cultivator said his name, then. The Patriarch heard the discordant scrape of it, tearing through him. But the cultivator did not see his pain. The cultivator\u2019s gaze was dark and steady as he continued, saying, \u201cI do not want you to think me a threat.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo cultivator alive is a true threat to me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI did not want you to think that I desire to threaten you,\u201d the cultivator corrected.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh,\u201d breathed the Patriarch, leaning down. They were the same height now, he and the cultivator. The cultivator did not move, but everything about his stillness screamed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you want, then, cultivator?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease,\u201d the man whispered. \u201cAllow me to stay with you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know you,\u201d the Patriarch said, with vicious gentleness. \u201cI have no memory of the man I was before, and no kindness in me for cultivators who don\u2019t respect my wards. I could murder you now, and I\u2019d feel nothing.\u201d He runs his fingertips in a line along the cultivator\u2019s throat. Back, forth. When had he lifted his hand? He didn\u2019t know. \u201cBut I am feeling generous, honourable cultivator, and I think perhaps I cared for you once. So go. Run, and I promise not to gut you like a dog.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI will not go,\u201d the cultivator said. \u201cI came here for you. I came here to remain with you. To\u2026 to be yours.\u201d The cultivator swallowed. The Patriarch felt his throat move. \u201cI will obey you. Be loyal to you. Anything. As I should have done long ago.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch almost laughed at the strangeness of that. He stopped stroking the cultivator\u2019s throat. Encircled it instead, with one hand, and brushed a rough thumb along the hard lines of the cultivator\u2019s jaw.\n\u00a0\n\u201cA man like you, saying such things,\u201d the Patriarch murmured. \u201cOffering yourself up to the Yiling Patriarch himself. Anyone would believe you were offering something you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe leered at the cultivator\u2026 who simply blinked back at him, and said, \u201cI am offering what I am offering.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYourself,\u201d said the Patriarch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTo you, Yiling Patriarch,\u201d he said, \u201cI offer all that I am, without reservation. I will do anything you ask of me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEven leave?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnything you ask, as long as I am yours,\u201d said the cultivator. \u201cI cannot be yours if you send me away.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe could leave the cultivator here. Let the wards close behind him. The cultivator would not be able to follow.\n\u00a0\nBut he could feel the cultivator\u2019s pulse thrumming in his hand. He tightened his grip, just a little, and watched the cultivator\u2019s eyelids flutter and felt a surge of want so strong that it almost felled him.\n\u00a0\nI want him, the rage whispered. You want him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have always wanted him.\n\n\u00a0\nThe hunger punched through him harder still, as he looked into the cultivator\u2019s eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou have a name, don\u2019t you? A noble cultivator like you, in such fine clothes! You probably have a title too. Tell me. Tell me all of it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLan Wangji,\u201d the man said, voice a vibration beneath the Patriarch\u2019s palm. \u201cMy title - Hanguang Jun.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThose are not all your names.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA flicker of those dark lashes, over piercing eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d the cultivator said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou want to be mine?\u201d the Patriarch asked. Lan Wangji nodded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen come with me,\u201d the Patriarch said silkily. \u201cAnd let us test your resolve together.\u201d He let go off the cultivator\u2019s throat. Stood. \u201cBut I won\u2019t make you do anything you don\u2019t wish to,\u201d the Patriarch said with a smile. \u201cYou can leave whenever you like, and never come back. How does that sound?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji watched him expressionlessly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt is a bargain,\u201d said Lan Wangji. He rose to his feet.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nIt would not take long to break this cultivator\u2019s resolve.\n\u00a0\nA man in white robes, with such fine hair and skin \u2013 a man like that would not be used to being shamed, to yielding or want, to begging or humbling himself.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch would simply be himself \u2013 no more than that \u2013 and the cultivator would flinch from him. Say no. Disobey. And then the Patriarch would graciously let him go.\n\u00a0\nI should kill him, the Patriarch thought distantly. But he could not give the idea serious thought. Even looking at Lan Wangji made his stomach swoop; made something rise in his blood and burn like poison in his veins.\n\u00a0\nHe could not kill this one. He didn\u2019t know why.\n\u00a0\nHe took the cultivator to his cave. The blood pool gave off a low red light that mingled with the candlelight. On the cultivator\u2019s skin, it took on the colour of roses.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re mine now,\u201d the Patriarch said. He shaped the words like a question.\n\u00a0\nThe cultivator nodded, wordless.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho was I to you, before? Was I your friend? Your lover?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe cultivator did not move a muscle. Said nothing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLan Wangji,\u201d said the Patriarch, testing the name. It felt as unfamiliar as all names did to him, now. \u201cHanguang Jun.\u201d This, for some reason, finally made the cultivator before him flinch. He filed that knowledge away. \u201cWhat did you used to call me? Tell me what I was named once more.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe cultivator swallowed. Spoke his name.\n\u00a0\nA sound like a knife.\n\u00a0\nBy now, the Patriarch was used to the pain of his name. He didn\u2019t even flinch. Instead he walked over to the cultivator until there was no distance between them until they were uncomfortably close, chest to chest, and said, \u201cAgain.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe cultivator froze. But he did not draw back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAgain,\u201d the Patriarch repeated, and pressed his mouth oh so close to Lan Wangji\u2019s own, just to feel the shadow of the shape of his own name on Lan Wangji\u2019s breath. He waited for Lan Wangji to flinch. To pull back. To say no.\n\u00a0\nInstead, he felt Lan Wangji\u2019s hesitation, and heard the familiar painful chime of the first syllable of his broken name. But Lan Wangji\u2019s voice faltered fast, leaving them sharing breath in absolute silence.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSay my name again,\u201d said the Patriarch. His mouth was still close to Lan Wangji\u2019s, and he felt more than saw the way Lan Wangji shivered at the movement of the Patriarch\u2019s own mouth, the caress of his breath. The Patriarch could not resist reaching out a hand, tracing the swoop of the cultivator\u2019s collarbones through all the thick cloth of his robes. \u201cAh, Hanguang Jun, why so silent? Don\u2019t you want me to be happy? Don\u2019t you want to obey me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA shudder ran through Lan Wangji.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI do,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen say my name,\u201d wheedled the Patriarch. \u201cSay it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji was still silent.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGo on,\u201d said the Patriarch. \u201cBe good, now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji\u2019s mouth parted reluctantly. Said his name.\n\u00a0\nA cymbal crash of broken noise, and the Patriarch shoved Lan Wangji back. The Patriarch felt giddy, the pain is sweet and clear and heady, and he laughed even as blood dripped from his nose.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you know, honoured cultivator, it hurts me here, to hear it?\u201d The Patriarch touched a fingertip to his own forehead. \u201cIt hurts me here. Like knives.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe cultivator flinched, his eyes widening.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI did not know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI did not, W-\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe stopped himself. Just.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo kind,\u201d the patriarch says softly. \u201cSo generous to me, Hanguang Jun.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI will not say your name again.\u201d The cultivator\u2019s expression was resolute.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI suppose you won\u2019t,\u201d the Patriarch said with a sigh, thinking of the Wens who look at him with soft, haunted eyes and refuse to call him anything but Yiling Patriarch, or master. \u201cI thought you came here for me,\u201d added the Patriarch. \u201cI thought you said you would do anything for me. Did you lie?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt is not my will to hurt you.\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s voice was tight. \u201cI would do anything for you but not \u2013 not hurt you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen you have already broken your word,\u201d said the Patriarch. \u201cYou offered me anything, and now you refuse me this?\u201d The Patriarch shook his head. \u201cI did not think I would break you so swiftly. But as I said \u2013 you may go.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d the cultivator said. \u201cNo. I.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cForgive me.\u201d His eyes were black with feeling. And then he said the Patriarch\u2019s name once more, as he\u2019d been bid, and gave a full-body flinch at the Patriarch\u2019s groan of pain, and the laughter that followed it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWould you truly hurt me again if I asked? Speak my name? Cut me, perhaps, with your blade?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf that is your will,\u201d said the cultivator, sounding wretched. And somehow that made the Patriarch feel ill, in a way he could not explain. He shoved the feeling aside.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, ah. No more names then. You don\u2019t like hurting me! I see that now. But I think it would be a pleasure to be used by you. Would you hold me down, honoured cultivator?\u201d His voice was still light. \u201cWould you enjoy making me scream?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf anyone must be hurt, let it be me,\u201d Lan Wangji said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHanguang Jun,\u201d the Patriarch said, disappointment dripping from his voice. \u201cIs it your free will, if you\u2019re afraid for me? You\u2019re so uptight. You musn\u2019t worry so much about me. Besides, you misunderstand me. I don\u2019t want you to hurt me. I want you to fuck me. I want you to make me scream from pleasure. That\u2019s not so bad, is it? Would you fuck me if I asked?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSilence.\n\u00a0\nHis nod was so small the Patriarch barely saw it. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nAh. Well.\n\u00a0\nFool that he was, he somehow hadn\u2019t expected that.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course you would,\u201d said the Patriarch, rallying. \u201cI\u2019m sure any cultivator would be proud to conquer me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou misunderstand me, Patriarch. I would be yours,\u201d said the cultivator, gaze unflinching. \u201cI would not conquer you. I have surrendered to you already. I was yours long before I ever came here and kneeled before you. I am yours even now.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou have perverse desires, Hanguang Jun,\u201d the Patriarch said with a laugh. \u201cYou came all this way to be mastered by me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI came here for you,\u201d said Lan Wangji. It sounded like agreement. This time, the cultivator was the one to step toward the Patriarch. \u201cI would please you,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever you desired.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch felt as if his equilibrium had been lost. Control of this situation \u2013 whatever it was \u2013 had slipped from his grasp.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd if I want to fuck you, honoured cultivator? What then?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen I would thank you,\u201d he said, in a low voice that made the Patriarch want to seize him by the throat and kiss the air out of him. Perhaps the cultivator was not the only one with perverse desires.\n\nThe Patriarch pushed, a little further. This, at least, would make this proud, pure cultivator balk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf I asked you to plead for my cock, would you beg, hm?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI would,\u201d Lan Wangji said simply.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGo on then,\u201d said the Patriarch.\n\u00a0\nAn infinitesimal hesitation. A blush of colour on the cultivator\u2019s ears.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease\u2026 use me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d the Patriarch said, the rage rolling in him, howling. Hungry. There was no possibility the cultivator would do it. None at all. Not this beautiful thing, robed in white, he would not sully himself, so the Patriarch pushed onward. \u201cSay it. Clearly. Beg.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease, Yiling Patriarch,\u201d said Lan Wangji. Such a steady, beautiful voice. \u201cPlease, give me your cock. I want you. I always have.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSo strange, to hear such lewdness spoken so eloquently.\n\u00a0\nThe rage in him stretched out its tendrils.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen prove it to me,\u201d said the Patriarch. \u201cStrip. Right now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe cultivator stripped down, layer by layer. A fine weft of cloth, white as snow, was removed. Another, the faint blue of clouds, joined it. Another robe of white, and then another even thinner layer, were folded and placed upon the ground, the cultivator bending forward to place them down, his hair cloaking his face as if he were some demure maiden. Then he straightened, standing tall again, letting the Patriarch look at him.\n\u00a0\nFirm, broad shoulders and a narrow waist. Sharp collarbones. He was pale as jade, so perfect that the Patriarch was almost sure that if he dug his nails into all that endless skin he wouldn\u2019t even be able to leave a mark. Some people were made not be to be sullied. If the Patriarch were a better man, he would not even try.\n\u00a0\nBut he was not a better man. His mouth felt very dry, and very hungry. He stared. The cultivator showed no signs of embarrassment or discomfort, his eyes still on the Patriarch, his face serene.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTrousers and boots too,\u201d the Patriarch said eventually. \u00a0\u201cI want you bare.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe cultivator\u2019s hands clenched faintly at his sides. Reluctant. \u00a0Perhaps he was not so unashamed after all.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou offered me everything,\u201d the Patriarch pointed out. \u201cNo one is forcing you to be here, Hanguang Jun. If you don\u2019t care for this game, you have my permission to go.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe cultivator removed the rest of his clothing without a word or another moment of hesitation. In mere moments was naked, and ah, he wasn\u2019t pale as jade all over after all. His cock was flushed and hard, heavy and vulnerable. The Patriarch had not even touched him yet. There were no more pretending, now, that Lan Wangji was beyond the base needs of human of flesh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKneel,\u201d said the Patriarch.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji went down willingly, but oh, he was proud. \u00a0His back was straight. His chin high.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch thought about how good it would be to see that proud face between his legs, mouth stretched and wet and full of cock, and realised with a rush of heat he did not simply need to imagine it. He could have that, right now. The cultivator had come to him, had offered himself up like a pretty beast to the slaughter. The Patriarch did not have to control himself.\n\u00a0\nWhen he seized hold of the cultivator\u2019s hair, Lan Wangji exhaled. Only once, sharp and soundless.\n\u00a0\nHe held the cultivator\u2019s hair in a painfully tight grip, all that slippery, dark hair wound tight around his fist. But the thumb he pressed against Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth was gentle. Open, the touch said. And Lan Wangji\u2026 did. The Patriarch felt the plushness of that lower lip, felt the jaw slacken, and looked down to see the cultivator\u2019s soft mouth parted, ready to take what it was given. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe removed his own aching cock from his trousers with surprisingly little difficulty, considering his own unwillingness to let go of that hair. It took time, one-handed, but Lan Wangji did not protest and did not move.\n\u00a0\nHe held Lan Wangji still; fisted his own cock once, twice, and watched Lan Wangji\u2019s eyelids flicker, a dark flush colouring the tips of his ears. The Patriarch forced himself to ease his grip on the leash of dark hair. Just enough.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTurn your head away, and I\u2019ll let you go,\u201d the Patriarch told him. He canted his hips forward, the tip of his cock brushing Lan Wangji\u2019s lips \u2013 and felt both the softness of that mouth and of Lan Wangji\u2019s punched out exhale as he shuddered. He did not try to turn his head away. Instead he tried to move his head forward. Tried to take the Patriarch in his mouth, with the faintest shimmer of tongue against his lips.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch tightened his grip, holding him still.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji looked up at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWould you have me beg again?\u201d he asked.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch had not planned to ask that of him. But suddenly it was all he wanted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said roughly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease,\u201d said Lan Wangji. \u201cPlease let me suck you. We-\u201c He stopped. Hands tightening into fists once more. \u201cYiling Patriarch,\u201d he said instead. \u201cLet me. I would \u2013 please you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHow could he say no to that?\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji had clearly never sucked a cock before. He was artless, clumsy. Careless at first with his teeth, until the Patriarch gripped his jaw and began to instruct him. Cover your teeth. Like this. Good, good. And your tongue \u2013 just there, ah. So obedient Hanguang Jun. Now lean forward. Take me deeper. I know you can, Hanguang Jun. There you go. \n\u00a0\nAnd like that, step by step, he made Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth biddable; made it wet with drool and softly open, his tongue curling obediently beneath the Patriarch\u2019s dick.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLan Wangji,\u201d he crooned. \u201cYou have a mouth made for this. Look how well you take it. You only needed to be taught.\u201d He tightened his hand on the cultivator\u2019s jaw, pressing his thumb to the skin of his cheek, feeling the shape of himself inside that mouth. Lan Wangji groaned. \u201cYou like a firm hand.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe shoved forward, feeling Lan Wangji choke around him, and came so hard his vision went white. After a moment he draw back, every inch of him burning still with hunger, and tucked himself away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFinish yourself,\u201d the Patriarch said casually.\n\u00a0\nHe expected Lan Wangji to take himself in hand right there on the floor, or leave and deal with himself, or demand that the Patriarch see to him. What he did not expect was the quiet hitch of breath that followed his words, or the way the cultivator\u2019s hands clenched tight on his spread knees, or even the way he lowered his head \u2013 as if he could not bring himself to do it. As if he were shy.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch placed a fingertip beneath Lan Wangji\u2019s chin, tilting his head up. The cultivator\u2019s eyes were blown, his lips swollen and chin slick. His cheeks were flushed. The Patriarch could see the red shadow of his own fingertips against that jaw. The cultivator was a mess, no longer a pure and peerless jade, and the Patriarch, who should have been satisfied wanted, wanted \u2013\n\u00a0\n\u201cTouch yourself,\u201d he said. His voice came out of him as a low growl. The shadows moved around them, thrumming with resentful energy. \u201cBe good for me now, Hanguang Jun. Touch yourself now. For me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji curled his own fingers around his cock. Tightened his fist, a rough drag up and down. And up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSlower,\u201d said the Patriarch. His voice was dark. \u201cDon\u2019t come yet. Take your time.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji\u2019s hand slowed. Up, slow, slow. Down. Slower still.\n\u00a0\nThe cultivator did not beg or plead, as the minutes ticked by. He only slowed down, more and more, his thighs shaking, his breath coming in sharp pants.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome,\u201d said the Patriarch. And Lan Wangji did, messy and silent, his eyes fixed on the Patriarch\u2019s, his mouth parted as if he could take the Patriarch all over again, as if he wanted to be good.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nAfter that, it was hard not to put Lan Wangji on his knees all the time.\n\u00a0\nBut the truth was, the Yiling Patriarch had other duties that unfortunately occupied his time. The wards required his constant attention and energy. His rage was a razor-winged bird, rattling against the edges of his consciousness. Containing it was an endless duty.\n\u00a0\nHe could not let (anyone else, not after Jin Zi-) the Wens be hurt by his carelessness. He had done this for them, after all.\n\u00a0\nHe had a feeling that someone, long ago, had told him cultivating resentful energy was dangerous. Someone from before his sacrifice \u2013 before he poured himself into the wards \u2013 had tried to save him. Whoever they were, poor fool, they hadn\u2019t been wrong. His anger was a beast. The only time it quietened was when he took a life, and his wards were fed with more than his own strength.\n\u00a0\nOr\u2026 when he had Lan Wangji kneeling before him, lips wrapped around the Patriarch\u2019s hardness, undressed where the Patriarch was fully clothed, leashed by his own hair, his obedient hands curled upon his knees or on his flushed cock, at the Patriarch\u2019s whims. Then, it was as if he felt no rage at all. Only pleasure, possessive and sweet. Only the warmth of Lan Wangji\u2019s perfect mouth.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji was not always at the Patriarch\u2019s beck and call. Over the days that followed, he carved a place for himself among the Wen Remnants. He began to dress like them, in dark and serviceable robes, keeping nothing of his old finery apart from his forehead ribbon, a pale embroidered thing that he clearly valued.\n\u00a0\nHe watched Lan Wangji work in the fields. There was a small child following him. The child kept on chattering, clinging to Lan Wangji\u2019s leg until the cultivator finally relented, and lifted the child up. The child was familiar, in a vague way, but the Yiling Patriarch did not really know him. Not anymore. No one had told him the child\u2019s name since his sacrifice.\n\u00a0\nA-Yuan, he thought suddenly. And with the thought came a nauseating rush of memory. A small toy on a stick. A child clutching his leg. The Patriarch smiling, as Lan Wangji looked at him, dressed in blue, his eyes gentle and full of quietly wanting \u2013\n\u00a0\nHe shoved the memory away.\n\u00a0\nThe memory. He should not have been able to remember this. He\u2019d sacrificed this along with everything else. In a panic, he tried to meditate where he stood, feeling for the wards. The tide of them held steady. The wards still held strong.\n\u00a0\nA fluke. That was all it was. But he looked again at Lan Wangji working with the Wen, in simple brown robes with his pale ribbon at his forehead, and felt something like disquiet.\n\u00a0\nThat night, when Lan Wangji came to the Patriarch\u2019s bed, the Patriarch didn\u2019t look at him as he said, \u201cLie down. On your back.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji stripped without being told to. The Patriarch watched as Lan Wangji lay down nude on his back. In the red light of the cave, he was beautiful. He would be beautiful in any light. Even looking at him made the Patriarch\u2019s chest go tight.\n\u00a0\n\nWhoever I was before, I could have had you. And I didn\u2019t. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI was a fool.\n\n\u00a0\nHe crouched over Lan Wangji and kissed him.\n\u00a0\nHe had never kissed him before. But he did not make this first kiss sweet. He did not bother with gentleness. He traced the seam of Lan Wangji\u2019s lips, forcing his mouth open, fucking between those lips with his tongue. Lan Wangji opened for him easily, as he always did; gave a sharp noise when the Patriarch bit down on his lip and sucked, harsh and leisurely, bruising that soft skin with his teeth.\n\u00a0\nAnother kiss followed, wet and filthy. Lan Wangji kissed him back intently, reverently, lifting his hands to brush over the Patriarch\u2019s hair.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch drew back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBe good for me,\u201d the Patriarch murmured, pressing kisses to his forehead, his nose, his jaw. He moved lower, running his fingertips over the planes of Lan Wangji\u2019s chest, scraping his nipples with the edges of his nails, digging his thumbs into the divots of Lan Wangji\u2019s hips. Every touch made Lan Wangji freeze for a moment, then twitch, as if he wanted to beg for more with every fibre of his body, but didn\u2019t know how.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet me fuck you, Lan Wangji.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji gave one of his silent, sharp exhales, as if the Patriarch had punched the air out of him. Then he nodded. Said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was oil for this. The Patriarch placed the vial in Lan Wangji\u2019s hand.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOpen yourself.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji froze again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have never,\u201d Lan Wangji said haltingly. And the Patriarch groaned, arousal rushing through him. He took hold of the oil and slicked up Lan Wangji\u2019s fingers himself, until they were slippery, gleaming.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTry anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji bit down on his own lip. Lowered his hand, adjusting. Slipped a finger inside of himself. The angle was clearly awkward. He was still on his back. He lifted his hips a little, canting them up. Spread his legs on the bed, his knees rising, heels digging down for purchase.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need another finger,\u201d the Patriarch told him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d A choked noise. \u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet me help you,\u201d the Patriarch said softly. He moved his own hand between Lan Wangji\u2019s legs. Pressed a finger into him. He felt Lan Wangji\u2019s own finger \u2013 felt the heat of his body twitch and tighten around the both of them inside him \u2013 and heard Lan Wangji gasp. When he looked up, he saw that Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes were wide, his mouth a dark o of surprise. It made the Patriarch want to kiss him, so he did. And again.\n\u00a0\nHe bit down on Lan Wangji\u2019s lower lip once more and felt him shudder, his body moving instinctually to take their tangled fingers deeper. Then he froze, and shuddered anew, and froze again, fucking himself in tiny, hitched increments.\n\u00a0\nAh. What a lovely vicious cycle.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere you go,\u201d the Patriarch murmured, drawing his mouth back. He moved his fingers back, forth. On skin, it would have been a soothing motion. But inside Lan Wangji \u2013 ah. It made the cultivator\u2019s body shudder, his hips twitch, another helpless, breathless noise escaping his mouth as he fucked himself helplessly, hungry for something the Patriarch wasn\u2019t ready to give him. Not yet.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d meant to fuck Lan Wangji hard. He\u2019d meant to quiet the strange memories swirling inside of him. Instead he opened the cultivator up with aching slowness. One finger, then two. Then a third, as Lan Wangji\u2019s own finger stayed inside himself, entirely still; as Lan Wangji\u2019s breath hitched over and over again, his throat red, his mouth bitten and swollen by his own teeth as he tried to hold the cries in. The Patriarch brushed his free hand over any inch of skin he could reach: Lan Wangji\u2019s arms, his wrists. His thighs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAsk for what you want,\u201d said the Patriarch. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Lan Wangji said, voice flat, but his body, ah \u2013 his body squirming on the bed, his legs parted \u2013 was an invitation the Patriarch had no desire to ignore, not anymore.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch withdrew his fingers.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTurn over,\u201d he said. Lan Wangji did. \u201cNow raise your hips. Just like this,\u201d he told him, taking hold of Lan Wangji\u2019s narrow hips, drawing them up until Lan Wangji was on his elbows and splayed knees, the slick furl of his body exposed to the Patriarch\u2019s eyes. The Patriarch could not resist touching him again, a single caress of his fingers that made Lan Wangji gasp and move his hips, restless and seeking.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch couldn\u2019t delay any longer. If anyone had tried to stop him taking Lan Wangji now he would have murdered them, would have gutted them with absolute fury and pleasure. But they were alone, and the Patriarch could do nothing but spread Lan Wangji\u2019s legs wider, and hold his hips, and press his own cock into Lan Wangji\u2019s waiting heat.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji\u2019s head arched back. He made a noise, utterly lost and wanting, and the Patriarch could do nothing but slide into him deeper and take hold of his hair one handed, drawing Lan Wangji\u2019s body into the press of his dick, helping Lan Wangji be good for him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re so tight,\u201d the Patriarch said reverently. \u201cShould I wait, Lan Wangj? Is it too much?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA breath. Another.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Lan Wangji, voice shaking. \u201cNo, I want \u2013 more. Please.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Lan Wangji \u2013 ah \u2013 rolled his hips, a sinuous, pleading movement that ran through his whole body. The Patriarch groaned and moved with him, drawing back, then shoving forward into the hot clench of Lan Wangji\u2019s body.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji pushed back to meet each thrust, his beautiful back arching. It should have looked lewd, but a surrender like this from a man who so clearly never surrendered anything was\u2026\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch had no words for it. He only wanted more. More of Lan Wangji. More of that voice pleading. More of that mouth around his cock, and those legs wrapped around his waist, and the shy lowering of those eyes when Lan Wangji wanted something too much and didn\u2019t know how to ask for it.\n\u00a0\nHe rolled his own hips, setting a steady rhythm that was both slow and merciless. It was something like the tide meeting the shore; something like the steady, hungry cadence of the wards he\u2019d built around the Burial Mounds. He could do this forever, he thought. Spend forever taking and taking Lan Wangji. But he felt Lan Wangji go very still, and make a choked noise \u2013 felt Lan Wangji come around him, entirely untouched \u2013 and nothing could stop the Patriarch from spending inside him, shoving deeper and deeper as if he could mark Lan Wangji just like this, collar and keep him just like this. Nothing could stop him pressing kisses to the wings of his shoulders, damp with sweat, as Lan Wangji shuddered beneath him, and twisted, still fucked open around the Patriarch\u2019s cock, seeking a kiss.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nHe woke in the night from a dream.\n\u00a0\nHe hadn\u2019t dreamt in so long. His heart was racing. He couldn\u2019t remember it.\n\u00a0\nHe felt hands on his arms; callused, elegant hands, soothing him, palms tracing him from shoulder to wrist.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d said Lan Wangji.\n\u00a0\nOf course. He\u2019d kept Lan Wangji in his bed. Held him by the wrists, when the cultivator had risen to go, hours before. He wasn\u2019t holding Lan Wangji\u2019s wrists anymore. Lan Wangji was holding him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou were having a nightmare,\u201d Lan Wangji said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI remember things I shouldn\u2019t remember,\u201d the Patriarch said. It was easy to be honest in the dark. Easy to be honest, too, to this particular man, for reasons the Patriarch couldn\u2019t explain. \u201cI gave those memories up. I fed the wards. If I begin to remember\u2026\u201d he shuddered. \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour strength will not fail,\u201d Lan Wangji said. As if he understood.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d the Patriarch told him, closing his eyes. \u201cYou know nothing of what I\u2019ve done to protect this place. What I\u2019ve given up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have faith in you,\u201d said Lan Wangji. \u201cAnd I am here. I will not allow your wards to fail.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis body believed it. Strange, how his aching heart eased, and his breathing slowed. If Hanguang Jun said he would not allow the wards to fail, they would not fail. If Hanguang Jun had faith, then the Yiling Patriarch could have faith too.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, Lan Zhan,\u201d the Patriarch said, with a smile in his voice that he couldn\u2019t contain. He brushed a hand through Lan Wangji\u2019s hair, feeling the softness of exhaustion roll back over him. \u201cYou are better than this one deserves.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch fell asleep, after that. And if Lan Wangji froze, when he heard Lan Zhan on the Patriarch\u2019s lips, or pressed his face to the Patriarch\u2019s arm and sobbed, ragged and quiet and hopeful, then it was only another dream, and one the Patriarch had forgotten by morning.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\n\u201cI should never have let you come here,\u201d said Wen Qing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou could not have stopped me,\u201d Lan Wangji replied.\n\u00a0\nThe Yiling Patriarch could not see them, where he stood beyond the makeshift kitchens. \u00a0The Yiling Patriarch was not meant to be here. Not meant to be listening to them. But he had heard the threads of Lan Wangji\u2019s voice and Wen Qing\u2019s combined, and followed them. Now he stood and listened to the sound of the two of them chopping vegetables, and of A-Yuan singing to himself, some nonsense song as he played on the floor at their feet.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI should never have sent you that message,\u201d Wen Qing said, sounding strangely both angry and close to tears. \u201cBut I thought, if anyone can save him from himself \u2013 if I can\u2019t, then surely Hanguang Jun \u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am glad you told me,\u201d Lan Wangji said evenly. Where Wen Qing was tearful, he was utterly calm. \u201cI am glad I am here.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSilence. Then.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe hurts you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe snap of the cleaver. Once, twice.\n\u00a0\nWen Qing continued. \u201cIf he were himself \u2013 he\u2019d never do this. He would never forgive himself.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t hurt me,\u201d said Lan Wangji, after a moment.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can see the marks on you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey are not hurts,\u201d Lan Wangji said. His voice was quiet and even. \u201cThey are \u2013 gifts.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA sound. Wen Qing. Laughing or crying?\n\u00a0\n\u201cLan Wangji.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know what you assume. But I\u2026 I am not hurt.\u201d There was a fierceness to his voice, unfamiliar, rich as flame. \u201cThey are proof that I can save him.\u201d A pause. \u201cTrust me in this, Lady Wen.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI suppose I don\u2019t have any choice,\u201d she replied.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch walked away.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nHe called Wen Ning to his side. Went to inspect the wards himself, and clear away any dead cultivators that resentful energy of the wards hadn\u2019t yet consumed.\n\u00a0\nThe wards still held strong. He watched Wen Ning walk beside him and thought, strangely, You were an archer once.\n\u00a0\nAnother memory he should not have had.\n\u00a0\nHis brain \u2013 his frayed, broken brain \u2013 worked through things slowly.\n\u00a0\nSomething had changed.\n\u00a0\nThe price the strength of the wards demanded had always been clear: everything. Everything the Patriarch had once been. Memories. Name. Heart.\n\u00a0\nBut now someone else had made a sacrifice. Someone else had paid a price equal to the one the Patriarch had paid, and something of the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s old self had returned to him.\n\u00a0\nHe looked closer at the wards. Closer still.\n\u00a0\nNow that he was paying attention, now that he was here in person\u2026 ah. There.\n\u00a0\nHe saw new strength in the wards: a golden ribbon, a skein of cultivation that slid through his grasp like music.\n\u00a0\nThis was not his spiritual energy. But it was there, in the wards, bound up among his curses. And it was making the wards even stronger.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nHe returned to his chamber in the early evening. Lan Wangji was already waiting for him, seated upon the bed. The ends of his hair were wet. He must have bathed. Lan Wangji stood when the Patriarch approached, and removed his own robes, deft and steady.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour ribbon,\u201d the Patriarch said. \u201cGive it to me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji went still.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt means something, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d the Patriarch observed. \u201cI knew that once.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji did not even breathe. His face was very pale. But his hands did not shake, when he reached up and removed the forehead ribbon, and placed it in the Patriarch\u2019s waiting palm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRemember you can go,\u201d said the Patriarch, shoving him down upon the bed. \u201cYou can always leave. I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji watched as the Patriarch stripped himself down until he was bare too, all his scarred and burned skin on display. He watched as the Patriarch leaned forward, ribbon still in his hand. He didn\u2019t flinch when the Patriarch kissed his thighs, or when he bit them, over and over again, sucking deep bruises into flesh. When the Patriarch took his cock in his mouth, licking his way up, sucking a shade too hard, Lan Wangji finally made a noise, a pleading groan, his bruised thighs tensing beneath the Patriarch\u2019s hands.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want you to ride me,\u201d the Patriarch said. \u201cFuck yourself down onto me. Satisfy me, Hanguang Jun and maybe\u2026\u201d he lowered his hand, still holding the forehead, ribbon, down on Lan Wangji\u2019s thigh. He slid the ribbon higher, letting the edge touch Lan Wangji\u2019s hardness. Lan Wangji shivered. \u00a0\u201cMaybe then I\u2019ll let you come. Do you understand?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji looked at him. He was breathing hard already, fast and shallow as if the Patriarch had stolen all the air from him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji said. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis hands twisted in the sheets, knuckles tight, as the Patriarch bound his cock with the forehead ribbon. Then Lan Wangji rose to his knees, watching as the Patriarch lowered himself back on the bed.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji reached for the oil himself, slicking his fingers, sliding them into himself with a roughness that spoke of desperation. He placed one hand flat on the bed beside the Patriarch\u2019s hip as he opened himself. There was a crease of tension between his brows. The Patriarch reached up, smoothing it away with his thumb, and moved his hand to clasp the back of Lan Wangji\u2019s neck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOn me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cHere.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe guided Lan Wangji up, until Lan Wangji was straddling him.\n\u00a0\nIt took a moment for Lan Wangji to take hold of the Patriarch\u2019s cock, and move his own hips into position. There was a long, luxuriant, awkward moment where Lan Wangji was above him, blushing and body bare and bound, gazing down into the Patriarch\u2019s eyes with a plea he didn\u2019t voice. The Patriarch took pity on him \u2013 grasped Lan Wangji\u2019s hips, murmuring, \u201cLike this,\u201d - and guided Lan Wangji down onto him.\n\u00a0\nLike this, he was so tight. Trembling all over, thighs all sweat-slick against the Patriarch\u2019s own as he lowered himself, inch by inch, taking it. Lan Wangji threw his head back, breaking eye contact. He was biting down on his lip, his chest rising and falling, his hands clenched at nothing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHold me, if you want,\u201d said the Patriarch. \u201cLan Wangji. Hold me,\u201d he repeated, and Lan Wangji\u2019s hands grasped at the Patriarch\u2019s sides instead, clinging as if the Patriarch\u2019s body was the only thing holding him steady against the pleasure burning through them both.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing something to me,\u201d the Patriarch observed, breathless from the slide of Lan Wangji\u2019s heat up and down and his cock. \u201cI know it\u2019s you. You \u2013 I remember too much.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe tightened his grip brutally on Lan Wangji\u2019s hips. Felt the heat of skin, the sharpness of bones. He was going to leave more bruises.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji clenched around him, hips moving with sudden violence. Taking him to the hilt.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t trust you,\u201d the Patriarch said, thrusting upward, he couldn\u2019t get close enough, couldn\u2019t get deep enough, it was driving him mad. \u201cI should kill you for it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji did not flinch. Only leaned forward, his hair a curtain around them, and kissed the Patriarch soundlessly on the mouth, panting with need, as he fucked down brutally hard, meeting the Patriarch violence for violence, want for want.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch made a broken noise.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI could never,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Lan Wangji.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI \u2013 Lan Zhan.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji was riding him, using him, kissing him without end.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSacrifice,\u201d the Patriarch gasped between kisses. \u201cIs that what \u2013 this is? Sacrificing yourself to me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s teeth against his lower lip, his jaw. \u201cPatriarch.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTo serve you,\u201d said Lan Wangji.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d the Patriarch asked again, feeling the way his own voice turned frayed, choked by feeling. He pinned Lan Wangji still with his hands, cock deep inside him, their legs tangled. And Lan Wangji went obediently still, breathing with him, rough and sweet.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am here for - love,\u201d said Lan Wangji.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo I stole your lover from you after all,\u201d the Patriarch said with a bitter laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Lan Wangji, ever so gentle, as he stayed still in the vice of the Patriarch\u2019s hands \u2013 as he wiped the tears from the Patriarch\u2019s cheeks. The Patriarch hadn\u2019t even known he was weeping. \u201cWant\u2026 my beloved\u2026 to remember himself.\u201d Another brutal roll of those hips. \u201cWant him to have\u2026 everything he desires.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch made a noise of surprise when he came. Lan Wangji hushed him, mouth soft on his own, swallowing the sound. It took a long time for the Patriarch to return to himself \u2013 to remember his rage and his hunger and the hollowness inside him which felt somehow less hollow, less all-encompassing.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji was still hard, still shaking. The Patriarch lifted him off of his cock; rolled him flat onto the bed, and took Lan Wangji into his mouth as he unknotted the ribbon. As it slithered free, Lan Wangji gasped, and hitched his hips, and came silently into the Patriarch\u2019s mouth.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch wiped his mouth clean, and kissed the soft skin of Lan Wangji\u2019s thigh. Salt, and hunger, and ownership. His. This man was his.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji stroked a hand over his hair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt is not sacrifice,\u201d Lan Wangji said, breathless, \u201cto give my beloved all that he desires.\u201d\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nHe dreamt of Lotus Pier.\n\u00a0\nShijie smiling. Jiang Cheng\u2019s scowl melting as he nudged the Patriarch\u2019s shoulder with his own. Eating lotus seeds, his feet in the water, his trousers rolled up to his knees.\n\u00a0\nCloud Recesses. The flash of a blade, silver in moonlight. A lantern rising into the air, and a young Lan Wangji\u2019s faint, wondering smile as they watched it drift away.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch woke. He was crying.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he whispered. Moving, moving, as pale dawn light filtered in. Lan Wangji rolled onto his back, and the Patriarch moved with him. It was so easy, so natural, to lie between Lan Wangji\u2019s spread thighs, and slide into him, deep and slow. Lan Wangji was still slick from the last time they\u2019d fucked; slippery with oil and spend, his hair a tangle at his back, his hips covered with the flowering marks of the Patriarch\u2019s fingers. The Patriarch placed his fingers over those marks, comforted by them, hungry to keep them there.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said again. The shape of that name in his mouth was like grief. \u201cWhat am I to you? Why are you here?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji looked up at him, the light worshipful on his face, his dark eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy soulmate,\u201d Lan Wangji said. \u201cYou are my soulmate.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh,\u201d the Patriarch breathed out. He closed his own eyes. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy soulmate,\u201d Lan Wangji said again, and this time it was tender. An endearment.\n\u00a0\nHe arched his back, moving with the Patriarch. Bared his throat, for the Patriarch to hide his face against. The Patriarch leaned forward and did just that, mouthing soft kisses against Lan Wangji\u2019s skin, closing his eyes desperately. He wished he could be the soulmate Lan Wangji remembered. But he was only this \u2013 this hungry, hateful thing that could never be enough \u2013 and Lan Wangji was a fool for being here, for offering himself up to what remained of the man he\u2019d loved.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve hurt you,\u201d said the Patriarch. \u201cI\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ve used you. And I don\u2019t want to stop, Lan Zhan. Do you understand?\u201d He shoved in deeper, Lan Wangji\u2019s body all clenched heat around him. He wanted to tie Lan Wangji to his bed; wanted to mark him and claim him and make him cry for the Patriarch\u2019s pleasure. He wants to say good, you\u2019re so good for me and watch Lan Wangji shudder and submit and be good for him, a thousand times over. He told Lan Wangji so, and felt Lan Wangji tighten around him. \u201cI want to keep you. The way I want you, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want,\u201d said Lan Wangji. \u201cI want as you want.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie to me, Lan Zhan,\u201d the Patriarch whispered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWant you to keep me with you always,\u201d Lan Wangji said. \u201cWant you to be with me every day. Your skin, your fingers, your cock. Your voice. Want you to tell me I am \u2013 good.\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s breath hitched then.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are good, Lan Zhan,\u201d the Patriarch said fervently. \u201cGood, so good, the way you take me. Ah, Lan Zhan,\u201d he breathed, fucking him with tight, deep circles of his hips. \u201cYou feel so good around me. Never want to stop being inside you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji\u2019s body locked around him tighter still, his hips moving, little hitched rolls of his body as he shuddered and arched tight as a bowstring, and said, \u201cPlease, please, I-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d the Patriarch told him. He brushed a hand over Lan Wangji\u2019s cock, and that was all it took. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said. \u201cCome for me. Let me hear you. Please.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Lan Wangji howled, head thrown back as he came, as he rolled his hips in absolute surrender. The Patriarch fucked into him, hard and vicious and desperate, one hand tightly clenched on Lan Wangji\u2019s hip, and let his own hunger drown him.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nIn the morning the Yiling Patriarch woke, and remembered everything.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch walked the edges of the Burial Mounds. The wards were still strong, pulsing with resentful energy. No Jin or Jiang, no Nie or Ouyang or Yao or Lan would pass those wards. His people were still safe. Everything he had managed to scrounge from death would continue to survive. But his anger was gone. The darkness in him was like a river, deep and silken and steady, its knife-sharp edges gone, its teeth blunted.\n\u00a0\nHe missed his shijie. He missed Jiang Cheng. He missed \u2013 everything. But missing meant remembering, and remembering meant being more than a hollowed out vessel for resentful energy and rage. It meant being himself.\n\u00a0\nHe stared beyond the wards. He heard footsteps behind him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve figured you out, Lan Zhan,\u201d the Patriarch said, not turning. \u201cWhat kind of forbidden books do you Lans keep in your library? You bunch of perverts. And after you tore up that book Nie Huaisang gave me, too! Do you have a whole section for erotic cultivation? I bet you do. Did you come here knowing you were going to fuck me well again? That was a foolish plan, Lan Zhan. I didn\u2019t know you were an idiot. To come here when I\u2019m \u2013 when I was\u2026 how could you risk yourself like this?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWei Ying.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not listening,\u201d the Patriarch said impatiently. \u201cYou, I would never have asked you-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he said again. His voice shook.\n\u00a0\nThe Yiling Patriarch froze.\n\u00a0\nHis name. He had heard his own name. There was no ring of pain through his skull. Only the steady presence of the wards, tied to his heart and his soul and his memories and his name. There was only Lan Wangji, saying his name, holding it in his mouth by a thread of magic born of love and of sacrifice.\n\u00a0\nHe turned sharply. Met Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes. Lan Wangji was smiling \u2013 the faintest, morning ray of a smile \u2013 but his face was wet with tears too.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he said again. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Yiling Patriarch \u2013 Wei Wuxian \u2013 Wei Ying exhaled, and began to shake. And strode across the Burial Mounds, throwing himself into Lan Wangji\u2019s waiting arms.\n\u00a0"
