    "text": "Bilbo never bothers denying that he is a slight, little bit, probably infatuated with Thorin. It\u2019s not something that bothers him. Really. He\u2019s pretty sure that everyone very likely has a little flutter in their chest for the dwarf. Thorin is just Thorin. He\u2019s the brooding lost king you always hear about in stories, larger than life and filling every space he occupies with a solid surety that draws everything in around him. Thorin\u2019s a magnificent legendary figure made real, walking around in Bilbo\u2019s formerly quiet, ordinary world.He\u2019s also a bullheaded, temperamental, arrogant moron who seems to expect that all he should have to do is lower his thick eyebrows and look Regally Angry enough to get whatever he wants. And when he smiles, rare as it is, it\u2019s a flash of white teeth and brilliantly blue eyes. He cares so intensely and warmly, so fully and deeply, and all of it comes out in this glowing grin that tugs insistently at something in Bilbo\u2019s chest every time it arrives.Bilbo doesn\u2019t let himself think on that part though, and he is always very firm with himself to keep it locked down whenever anything deeper than a little flutter starts to stir. It\u2019s better to stay shallowly infatuated with the Hero Thorin. Because Thorin is something grand and so, so unobtainable. And that\u2019s alright, because it\u2019s much safer that way.-------------\u201cThorin no, come on look at me, Thorin, look at me.\u201d The wind is screaming with eagles and death and the ice is biting into his legs and Thorin\u2019s blood is hot and and sticky-thick between his fingers. There\u2019s been so much death and horror and blood and he knows someone should be looking for Fili and Kili, but all he can think about is how Thorin can\u2019t die. He can\u2019t die and leave a hole in the space he always filled up. He can\u2019t leave Bilbo in a world that isn\u2019t made more full with the existence of Thorin Oakenshield.Thorin watches him with a distant and faded wonder and smiles weakly with something warm and welcome and final, and Bilbo presses his hand down tight over the hole in Thorin\u2019s side, grits his teeth against the stench of blood in the air and the gore under his palm.\u201cBilbo \u2026\u201d It\u2019s a soft, rasping sigh and Bilbo refuses to hear any of the rest of it.\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t you dare say goodbye to me, Thorin Oakenshield. Do you hear me? You\u2019re not done here. You aren\u2019t done, we aren\u2019t done. Look at me, Thorin, look at me. Keep breathing, just stay awake, and look at me.\u201dThorin looks at him. His eyes are distant, and the bright blue is a dulled gray, but he does as he\u2019s told and looks at Bilbo without asking why. He\u2019s looking at Bilbo when talons delicately and gently scoop under them, and he\u2019s looking at Bilbo in the air and as they land. He only closes his eyes as other hands gather him away and he\u2019s taken into a room of cots and whispered voices. (But Bilbo holds onto his hand because he can\u2019t let Thorin go. If he lets go then Thorin could go forever and Bilbo feels he has to keep his bloody fingers clenched on Thorin\u2019s hand to keep him anchored here.)Bilbo\u2019s still looking hours later, staring at Thorin swaddled up in bandages, blood wiped away, pale but breathing against the pillows. Bilbo keeps looking until the aches and pains in his body, combined with what he\u2019s sure was some heavily laced tea courtesy of Oin, overcome him and fade everything into black.\n\n\u00a0\n\n------------Thorin\u2019s warmer to him since the goblin tunnels. Bilbo thinks he perhaps should have thrown himself at some orcs earlier, because it\u2019s like a switch has been flipped and Thorin is calling him to sit in the middle of the group, and he actually pays some attention to what Bilbo says instead of just scowling at him whenever he remembers the hobbit exists.He\u2019s just starting to think it\u2019s downright peaceful when Thorin sits heavily beside him on a log and, without a word, pulls out Orcrist and begins carefully wrapping the blade tight in a leather cloth.Bilbo stares at him for a few seconds, waiting for some sort of explanation. He raises his eyebrows, clears his throat a little bit, lowers his eyebrows, then finally sighs as Thorin binds his sword.\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\u201cPull out your sword,\u201d Thorin interrupts, finishing a knot and giving the wrappings an experimental tug. Bilbo does, still frowning, and holds the hilt awkwardly in his fist. \u201cOkay \u2026 why did I do that?\u201dThorin looks up to answer, then his eyes flit to Bilbo\u2019s hand on the hilt of the sword. He scowls like he has been personally offended and his nostrils flare with a sharp exhale. \u201cIt\u2019s not a ladle,\u201d he huffs, reaching out and grabbing Bilbo\u2019s wrist in one massive hand and covering Bilbo\u2019s fist with the other. He adjusts Bilbo\u2019s fingers and the sword, ignoring Bilbo\u2019s incredulous stammering as he talks. \u201cYou can\u2019t clutch it that tightly; you\u2019ll lose control of the blade. This is a small, quick weapon. Have most of your grip closest to the guard, your fingers loose and ready to shift so you can adjust your grip easily.\u201d\u201cOkay? Wait. What are you doing?\u201d\nThorin\u2019s sigh is long suffering, his eyes going skyward for a second at Bilbo\u2019s apparent stupidity at not being able to automatically know what the blazes he\u2019s doing at all times.\u201cI\u2019m going to teach you how to use a sword.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Wow. That is actually \u2026 \u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 very nice of you actually. Considerate. Considering that I may be using this again. Later. At some point, hopefully not soon.\u201d\u201cMy goal is to at least make sure you can use it without taking your own fool head off.\u201d \u201cExcuse me?\u201d Oh, never mind any of the thanks! Bilbo is about to remind Thorin that this fool head is the one that saved his life, thank you, but he shuts his mouth on it quickly with an annoyed huff. It\u2019s rude to point out that someone is in your debt, after all.Thorin raises his eyebrows slightly. \u201cI saw how you flung that thing around. You were closer to hurting yourself than anything else.\u201dBilbo shuts his mouth with a click of teeth, thinks on it, then nods. \u201cRight. Good point. Probably want to avoid that. So why all the \u2026 that?\u201d He gestures to the binding on Thorin\u2019s sword.\u201cWe don\u2019t have wooden blades here. This is so I don\u2019t end up accidentally hurting you.\u201d\u201cOh. Good. Thank you for that. You\u2019re not going to, uh,\u201d Bilbo waves his sword a bit. \u201cJust in case I\u2014\u201dThe look Thorin gives him is absolute pity.\u201cOh, right, of course not, nevermind.\u201d \u201cExactly,\u201d Thorin says, standing up and pulling Bilbo roughly to his feet. \u201cNow, what do you know of swords?\u201dWhat sort of question is that? The closest thing Bilbo had held to a sword before this was a toothpick. He holds his blade before his face and makes a show of considering it, turning it to glint in the light as he weighs it in his hand. \u201cWell, I do know, though this is mainly an academic knowledge, mind you. But I do know for certain that this bit,\u201d he says, giving the blade a smart and certain tap with his finger, \u201cgoes into the squishy parts.\u201dHe keeps his expression very serious. Even in the face of the stare Thorin gives him, as if he has just sprouted not one, but two extra heads. Bilbo leaves him hanging for a few moments, just to enjoy the absolutely flummoxed confusion on Thorin\u2019s usually grim features, before he grins and raises his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m not wrong, am I?\u201dThorin stares at him for a few more seconds, his mouth opening and shutting a few times, then he honest to gods snorts and ducks his head. Bilbo sees a flash of teeth while the dwarf shakes his head in disbelief.\u201cNo. You\u2019re not wrong on that at least, Master Burglar.\u201d---------------------------------------------------------------There\u2019s the heat of a roaring fire on his face when he comes to. Warm air, scratchy cloth under his face, and a crick in his back from passing out slumped forward in the chair he\u2019d pulled up next to Thorin\u2019s cot. His back declares a very loud argument when he moves to sit up, and Bilbo groans at the pops and cracks. Next time he gets his own cot.He\u2019s still rolling his shoulders and wincing when he hears rustling sheets and a small shift in Thorin\u2019s breathing. A few wrenches in his neck loudly proclaim themselves and are ignored as Bilbo whips his head around and confirms that yes, Thorin is stirring and his eyelids are starting to flutter, though his skin is ashen and shining with fever.\u201cBilbo?\u201d It\u2019s such a lost, soft, sad little sound that Bilbo nearly scrambles up to grab at Thorin\u2019s shoulder and shush him. \u201cRight here. Right here, Thorin, I\u2019m here. Lie down. Just \u2026 stay there. You got a bit banged up and a few more uh \u2026 holes \u2026 in places. Just lie down. Balin said you\u2019d probably be feverish for a few days and\u2014\u201d\u201cBilbo?\u201d Thorin\u2019s eyes dart all over Bilbo\u2019s face, wide and desperately fevered. He grabs at Bilbo\u2019s arm, fingers scrabbling at his shirt until Bilbo places a hand over them with more flurried shushings.\u201cCalm down, Thorin, it\u2019s alright. Everything\u2019s alright, just rest up and\u2014\u201d\u201cBilbo. Bilbo I\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Thorin\u2019s voice catches, rough and dry in his throat, his eyes still wide and wet and darting. \u201cI am shamed, Bilbo. The way I acted. The things I said.\u201d\u201cNo, shh, come on now. You weren\u2019t yourself, Thorin. It\u2019s alright. You were sick.\u201d\u201cI was wrong,\u201d Thorin gasps, and he looks so pained, so gutted that Bilbo rubs the hand clutching at his shirtsleeve, making soft, calming sounds to try and get Thorin to ease back and stop looking so lost and horrified. \u201cThorin, really, stop it. It\u2019s alright!\u201d\u201cI tried to kill you,\u201d Thorin whispers, fingers nearly bruising Bilbo\u2019s arm now. His voice hitches and cracks hoarsely.\u201cI wanted to kill you. I couldn\u2019t, I could never. It wasn\u2019t\u2014You were the only one brave enough to do what was needed and I\u2014\u201d\u201cThorin, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s really okay. I forgive you. You were sick and now you\u2019re you and it\u2019s okay. Just calm down and\u2014\u201d\u201cI was going to throw you,\u201d Thorin goes on, breathing it, now, and shaking. \u201cThrow you from the wall. Make you\u201d\u2014his face twists, pained and sick\u2014\u201cmake you break on the stones. You. I was going to hurt you. My own betrothed and I nearly destroyed you\u2014\u201d\u201cThorin, please! Calm down and\u2014\u201d Bilbo stops. His mouth opens, shuts, repeats a few times before he settles on pressing his lips hard together. Thorin\u2019s words replay back and forth a few times in his head. \u201cSorry, what was that?\u201d\u201cForgive me, Bilbo, forgive me, please\u2014\u201d\u201cYes, yes, alright! I forgive you! Plenty of times already! Now what on earth\u2014\u201d\u201cKeep it,\u201d Thorin demands, fisting his hand in Bilbo\u2019s shirt, eyes blazing. \u201cThe mithril, keep it.\u201d\u201cYes, yes I was planning to, I don\u2019t know why I wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve no right.\u201d Thorin coughs and Bilbo is beside himself trying to calm Thorin while his chest seems to have quite forgotten where all the internal bits are supposed to go, and it\u2019s making everything tight and difficult to breathe. Thorin goes on regardless, shaking his head firmly. \u201cNo right. No right to call you mine, Bilbo, I know, but keep it.\u201d\u201cThorin, what does the mithril\u2014\u201d\u201cKeep it. Bilbo \u2026\u201d Thorin\u2019s grip starts to go lax, his eyes fluttering, and Bilbo\u2019s name leaving as a sigh.\u201cNo. Nooono. No! Thorin! Don\u2019t you\u2014! No, do not fall asleep! Thorin! What was\u2014\u201dThorin breathes out softly, sinking into the pillows and drifting off again, forehead tensed with fever dreams but otherwise lost to the waking world.Bilbo sits.Everything is all sharp and jumpy and he can\u2019t place what the feeling is, but it feels a remarkable deal like panic, like a scream lodged in his chest. Because none of that, besides the apologies, made any sense. Thorin is sick. Thorin is confused. Something desperately beating flares in his chest, compresses his lungs and makes every breath into a short gasp. Bilbo scrubs a hand over his face and shuts his eyes, feels the air fill his chest and slowly empty, again and again, until he can let out a steady exhale and lower his hand. He tries to clamp down on the beating, shoving it back down into the safe place.There just needs to be some clarification. There\u2019s been mistranslation somewhere, certainly. Thorin is sick. Thorin is confused. Thorin is unobtainable.----------------------\u201cTell me about the Shire.\u201dIt\u2019s a warm, clear night. A rare breath where they\u2019re far from anything chasing them and everyone is taking their time getting ready for bed. Bilbo has taken the first watch, which has been normal ever since it had been discovered how good his eyes were, and that he tended to stay up a little later anyway. The air is calm, the breeze just perfectly cool in the late spring. Thorin had sat by him without a word on the bit of rocks Bilbo had settled on, pulling out his knives to clean in the comfortable silence that has been growing into a regular occurrence.\n\nBilbo thinks it has to do with the fact that the two of them are the only ones in the group who really can be easily quiet for long periods of time. The dwarves tend to be a rowdy bunch, and sometimes one just needs a breather. \n\n\nThe silence is so comfortable, in fact, that it takes a bit for the words to register to Bilbo. He blinks, shakes himself and looks over with an apologetic twist of the mouth. \u201cSorry, didn\u2019t catch that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe Shire, tell me about it,\u201d Thorin replies, voice smooth and low. Bilbo\u2019s come to recognize it as a sort of special conversational tone, something that only comes out in quiet moments like this, when Thorin won\u2019t quite look up from what he\u2019s doing.\n\n\n\u201cAaaahhhhh \u2026\u201d Bilbo trails off and blows out through pursed lips, shrugging and humming as he thinks. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit of a general topic? There\u2019s quite a bit to the Shire, you know. Well. Maybe not. Not compared to what all you lot have put up with. But there\u2019s a lot to be talked about and trust me, not all of it is really all that interesting. What bits of the Shire do you want to know about?\u201d\n\n\nThorin shrugs, a jerky hitch in one shoulder as he scrubs and buffs at one of his smaller blades with an odd amount of focus.\n\n\n\u201cHelpful,\u201d Bilbo says drily. \u201cThat narrows it down. If you don\u2019t come up with a more select topic I\u2019ll just start rattling off the names of the entire Baggins family tree.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat parts do you miss?\u201d Thorin asks, still low and strong. But there\u2019s something a little softer in his voice. \u201cWhen you think of it,\u201d he goes on, still not looking up, \u201cwhat parts come to your mind first?\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s another pause, a few moments of breathing while Bilbo thinks about it. He hasn\u2019t really let himself do that as much lately, think about the Shire. It\u2019s so far behind that it feels like a dream, like life has always been the travel and the road and running.\n\n\n\u201cThe woods,\u201d Bilbo finally says, almost wincing at the wistful way his voice sighs out. \u201cThe little rivers \u2026 it\u2019s such a small yet sprawling place. The people and homes are tucked away, but the trees are so large and the rivers so full and rushing by. There\u2019s peace. It\u2019s always so quiet and peaceful and there\u2019s always light and warmth. Even when it rains, it\u2019s soft and warm. Everything there is nurturing. It\u2019s like the land itself is trying to take care of everyone there.\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s the land that keeps coming to him. He misses his armchair when he sits on the stones and he misses his hearth when the wind guts their campfires, but in moments like this he thinks of the wind through the trees and the bubbling sound of rivers and brooks that can be heard no matter where you stand. \n\n\nHe realizes the pause has gone on for a bit again, and he realizes that Thorin\u2019s looked up now, hands stopped on his knives as he watches Bilbo. There\u2019s something searching, something open and longing, like he\u2019s drinking in every word from Bilbo\u2019s mouth. Bilbo blinks at the open stare, and clears his throat. Thorin quickly looks away, mouth twisting oddly, and goes back to his work.\n\n\n\u201cWhy? If I may?\u201d Bilbo asks, honestly curious. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t the kind of place you\u2019d be interested in.\u201d Thorin\u2019s head whips up, giving Bilbo another odd, searching look that makes his skin tingle, and he has to look away, break the contact and cough a bit. \u201cI mean, I guess you could be? But it\u2019s just \u2026 it\u2019s such a little place. It\u2019s small and quiet and nothing exciting ever happens there. It\u2019s just \u2026 the Shire.\u201d\n\n\nThorin blinks slowly, his mouth twisting again and jaw clenching a few times, before he shrugs and his face goes blandly neutral. \u201cIt\u2019s pleasant, at times,\u201d he says stiffly. \u201cHearing people tell tales of home.\u201d\n\n\nHome. \n\n\nIt makes sense now. Thorin hanging on words of home, even if it isn\u2019t his. Listening to how others feel of home, what they miss, what their memories are. The dwarf stubbornly sets his gaze on the horizon, eyes flitting back and forth, and it\u2019d be a perfect replica of scanning for danger if it wasn\u2019t for the way his throat was swallowing, his jaw clenching and unclenching.\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Bilbo says, smiling a bit, \u201cyou\u2019ll have some of your own I expect, at the end of this.\u201d\n\n\nThorin looks back at him, brows furrowed. \u201cSome what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStories about home. You\u2019ll be able to have some again, when we get your little mountain back to you.\u201d\n\n\nThe silence crashes in, and Bilbo swears Thorin turns to stone. His fists clench sharply in his lap and Bilbo worries for a second that Thorin will cut himself on his blade. Thorin\u2019s so stiff that Bilbo fears that he\u2019s somehow angered the dwarf, but then there\u2019s his face. \n\n\nHe looks pained. Sort of. He\u2019s just staring at Bilbo, face still but eyes oddly frantic as he looks at the hobbit, hands clenching and unclenching between his legs. It\u2019s such a nearly vulnerable thing that Bilbo wants it to stop, wants to break away from it, but he also wants to ask what on earth is going through that strange, dark mind.\n\n\nBefore he can figure out how to ask, or even what to ask, Thorin shoots up, bids a hurried, hoarse goodnight, and strides off back towards the camp.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------The next time Thorin stirs into consciousness, Bilbo has found a book to very firmly distract himself with. He doesn\u2019t realize that Thorin\u2019s stirring until he feels the brush of a hand on his forearm that makes him jump.\u201cThorin! You\u2019re awake!\u201d He grimaces at the shrill edge to his voice and takes a few breaths. \u201cHow uh \u2026 how\u2019re you then?\u201d\u201cHow are you so small and soft?\u201d Thorin asks hazily, eyes narrowed and bleary.\u201cOh. Good. You\u2019re still all wonky in the head.\u201d Bilbo sighs, swallowing nervously and fighting the urge to brush off the warm, solid and calloused fingertips on the skin of his arm. \u201cAnd who\u2019s soft?\u201d he asks brusquely, narrowing his eyes at the prone king. \u201cLast time I checked, I\u2019m not the one babbling away in a fever from a lot of wounds now am I? So tell me again who\u2019s small and soft then?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re such a little thing,\u201d Thorin says in a dazed wonder, less frantic than before but eyes still fever bright and the red splotches on his cheeks bright against his pale skin. \u201cSuch a small thing, and yet you\u2019re so large. I don\u2019t understand you.\u201d\u201cThorin, I\u2019m just \u2026 Bilbo. And you\u2019re not yourself right now. I prefer this sick Thorin to the last sick Thorin, don\u2019t get me wrong, but the fact still stands that you have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cSo small,\u201d Thorin says again, \u201cand you\u2019re always so kind and loyal and simply good.\u201d Thorin exhales sharply at that, brows furrowing as if that is the most confusing and incredible thing of all. \u201cEverything you do is with goodness and warmth. Everything seems soft, but there\u2019s steel. You\u2019ve steel in your bones and fire in your blood. But you\u2019re still so soft. I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand you.\u201dThe air\u2019s getting too thick again, closing in, and no one describes Bilbo like this. He\u2019s gotten used to \u2018small\u2019 and \u2018little,\u2019 but Thorin\u2019s voice is thick with a breathy reverence. It\u2019s like he\u2019s describing an abstract but stunning artwork, a poem with a hidden meaning. Like something that\u2019s most definitely not Bilbo.\u201cThorin \u2026 I don\u2019t. Just stop. You\u2019re not yourself and you have no idea what you\u2019re saying. None. I\u2019m just me. I\u2019m not all \u2026 all that, with the steel and fire. I\u2019m just Bilbo. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d Thorin suddenly pleads, fingers firmer on Bilbo\u2019s arm, as if Bilbo might get up and walk away right now.\u201cThorin, I\u2019m right here. I\u2019m not leaving for a while yet, not until\u2014\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Thorin repeats, sharper now. He goes on frantically, voice harsh and almost quietly manic, \u201cYou\u2019re bigger than them. Better than them. You\u2019re too much, too you for that place Bilbo. You\u2019re too Bilbo. You can\u2019t. You can\u2019t go back there.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my home,\u201d Bilbo whispers, chest aching and stabbing and he can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s at Thorin\u2019s words, the emotions behind them, or the distant pain of the thought of the quiet, warm and sunny Shire.\u201cI can make this home,\u201d Thorin says, grits it out with a strange ferocious certainty, his eyes shining. It\u2019s brilliant and burning but also so different from the burn of the dragon sickness. \u201cI can. You should be here.\u201d\u201cI\u2014\u201d\u201cOnce, then.\u201d Thorin\u2019s soft again, fingers back to a brush and eyes guttering a bit from the burning, dying back down to the shining and glazed fever-gleam. \u201cJust once.\u201dBilbo looks to the wall, working his jaw and blinking rapidly as he tries to sort out what\u2019s happening. Thorin is sick. Thorin is confused.\u201cOnce before you\u2019re gone,\u201d Thorin says softly, voice starting to peter out into the sigh of another sleep episode.\u201cOnce wh\u2014\u201d Bilbo doesn\u2019t see the hand reaching for his collar, fisting it with a shocking strength and yanking him down.It\u2019s hardly a kiss. Not really. Bilbo nearly bashes his nose on the way down and their lips meet in more of a smushed crash than anything else. But he feels it spark down his back and dance over his skin and grab at his lungs, lighting him on fire while Thorin lets out a slow sigh and goes lax beneath him. Bilbo\u2019s rearing back up as quickly as he was dragged down, gasping and almost wheezing with the shock of it all while he tries to process the fact that Thorin kissed him and then fell asleep.\u201cWh\u2014What. What! What just\u2014! Thorin! Thorin, wake up! Don\u2019t you dare\u2014No. No, you do not get to. To just\u2014\u201d Bilbo shoots up, shaking and stammering and \u2026 and angry. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s exactly what this is! Anger! How dare Thorin just\u2014! Just do that! That there! With the kissing!He paces the room, breath coming fast and his hands scrubbing through his hair. Thorin is sick! He\u2019s not in his right head and \u2026 what? What had he been talking about with the mithril earlier, with the damned talk of betrothed and home and staying and, and the kissing!Bilbo pivots sharply from his pacing to face the bed again and the pale, sleeping dwarf on it. He points an accusing finger sharply at Thorin, nearly shaking with the cacophony of emotions exploding everywhere. \u201cWe,\u201d Bilbo hisses, \u201cwe \u2026 are going to have a discussion when you\u2019re lucid again, Mister Thorin Oakenshield.\u201d-----------------------------------\u201cI look absurd. I\u2019m a hobbit, not a warrior!\u201d Bilbo sighs, holding out his arms to prove his point and wincing at the clinking chime of metal. It\u2019s a beautiful thing, no doubt, and very kind of Thorin to give to him, but Bilbo doesn\u2019t think he could ever be comfortable in something so glittering.It\u2019s quiet. He realizes the dwarves are silent and watching, and Bilbo feels like he\u2019s missing something vitally important again, because the dwarves are silent and watching like witnesses, and Thorin\u2019s eyes are burning through him, flaming and roaring behind the expanse of his blown pupils. He\u2019s gotten used to Thorin\u2019s long stares, but this makes him want to shrink away, to hide, not from the strange emotions usually caught in Thorin\u2019s gaze, but from the memory of burning orange eyes in the dark. And then Thorin\u2019s yanking him aside, voice frantic and low and flaming still with the growl of suspicion. Even his smile is twisted. Thorin\u2019s smile, which had before been a rare and glowing treat that Bilbo had seen a bit of when he had shown the acorn, is now a dazed and sickly thing, burning with a happiness that feels deranged and twisted. He growls and the dragon\u2019s voice echoes in Bilbo\u2019s ears, drowns out the sound of the dwarves marching up towards the wall; their metal clangs and clashes against stone, but it\u2019s the dragon that Bilbo still hears.As the last of the dwarves stomps by, Thorin still stares at him from across the narrow hall, something dark in his gaze, dark and burning and glowing like the dragon\u2019s chest did before a spout of flame.\u201cI \u2026\u201d Bilbo clears his throat and quickly looks away, feeling sick with the need to run, to run away from Thorin, who is still looking, still making Bilbo feel like a small and helpless thing pinned down for inspection. \u201cI\u2019ll just \u2026 I\u2019ll be \u2026\u201d He gestures towards the front of the hall, where the others are standing along the ramparts, and coughs again, stepping out to quickly hurry to them.Thorins hand shoots out and is an iron grip on his upper arm. Armored fingers dig so sharply into the muscle that Bilbo has to bite down on a yelp at the sharp pain of it. He\u2019s yanked back, held firmly in place, and Thorin is looming over him, eyes incandescent.\u201cNot you,\u201d he says, the low, smooth voice a stark contrast to the earlier snarling growls. \u201cYou\u2019re to go to the treasure halls.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d He can\u2019t honestly be expected to guard \u2026 ?\u201cIt\u2019s safer!\u201d Thorin snaps, fingers digging in. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s where you belong.\u201d\u201cThorin, what\u2014\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re to stay there until I come to get you, is that understood?\u201d Thorin growls, not angry, but still aggressive, dark and dangerous.\u201cThorin, what on earth am I going to be able to do down there? I can\u2019t guard it all by myself.\u201d\u201cThey will not,\u201d Thorin hisses, pulling Bilbo in a few inches, \u201ctake anything from me. The thieves. The usurpers who would have what\u2019s mine. I won\u2019t let them. Do you understand me?\u201d Thorin\u2019s other hand comes up, gripping Bilbo\u2019s shoulder, fingers curling into the mithril. Thorin fists the thin metal in his hand, staring over where it hangs on Bilbo\u2019s body. His voice drops further and he bares his teeth in a feral snarl. \u201cThey won\u2019t have anything that\u2019s mine. Now do as I say.\u201dBilbo nods, mouth dry and lungs robbed of air. Thorin relaxes visibly as soon as Bilbo agrees; the hands digging painful bruises release him and rub over where they had sunk into Bilbo\u2019s flesh, as if in apology. Thorin leans in a little, and sighs heavily. Bilbo forces himself to suck air down and not start shaking, even when Thorin lifts one hand and rests it along his jaw, the metal armor biting into his skin, and Bilbo nearly flinches at the contact.\u201cWe will speak of this later. After I\u2019ve defended our home. Wait for me, Bilbo.\u201dWith that, he releases Bilbo, who nearly slumps to the ground in relief as Thorin marches off. He stumbles back, falls against the wall and covers his mouth to hide the terrified, pained noise that tries to claw its way up from his ribs. He walks in a daze to the treasure, the gold glowing with its own light, catching the flickering fire of the torches all around. He waits for a few hours, forces his breath to even, and feels the Arkenstone heavy and digging into his ribs.As soon as he knows it\u2019s dark out, he snatches up one of the long, homemade ropes and heads to the front wall.\n\n\u00a0\n\n-----------------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo leaves and doesn\u2019t go back to where Thorin\u2019s tucked away, instead wandering the mountain with shaking limbs and ragged breath. He does end up eventually going back to the infirmary, thinking to grab some of the calming tea that Oin is already well stocked up on.He nearly pours the scalding water on himself, his hands are still shaking so much, and he\u2019s flapping his hand out in the cool air and cursing softly when he hears a soft, sweet, lyrical laugh echo through the stone halls, a delicate sound that is instantly out of place in the sharp mountain.There\u2019s another more familiar laugh, and Bilbo follows it and the tinkling of conversation to the lit sickrooms, away from the crowded main hall filled with cots of the wounded. \u201cA'maelamin.\u201d Definitely not something that belongs here. It\u2019s a womans voice, flowing and pure, and Bilbo frowns at the elvish words in the dwarven mountain. He finally places the room where the conversation is coming from and his first impression is fiery red hair catching the candlelight and a long green body tucked and curled around the small form on the bed. The elf woman, the guard from Mirkwood, curled easily on the bed that is much too small for her, her legs and arms almost forming a cage around Kili.She\u2019s bright and giggling and smiling sweetly, but Bilbo\u2019s reminded of a large mountain cat, protecting what\u2019s hers from the rest of the world with soft purring and sheathed claws.\u201cAmelamanin?\u201d Kili tries, frowning through a smile when the elf woman laughs in delight. Bilbo\u2019s anxiousness is dispelled completely for a bit by a rushing relief that Kili is very much alive, a profound confusion as to what the elven guard is doing braced over him and teaching him sweet elvish endearments, and a wild thought of \u201cDoes Thorin know about whatever is going on here?\u201d\u201cAh, Bilbo, thank Mahal you\u2019re here.\u201d Bilbo\u2019s attention is brought to the other cot, where Fili is nearly completely hidden in the swathes of bandages covering him. \u201cFili!\u201d Bilbo forgets the odd pair on the bed for a second, manages to briefly forget Thorin and all \u2026 all that that\u2019s with Thorin, and rushes over. The last time he saw Fili, the dwarf had violently kicked himself out of Azog\u2019s grip and gone tumbling down the mountain. Bilbo runs over, grinning near to split his face with relief because that\u2019s everyone, everyone\u2019s alive. They\u2019ve done it, and everyone\u2019s made it through this madness. \u201cAh, thank heavens you\u2019re alright! Well\u201d\u2014he clears his throat and takes stock of how completely immobilized Fili is by all the wrappings\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re mostly alright. Alive, anyway.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be much longer!\u201d Fili huffs, then winces in absolute pain at the tittering from the other bed in response. He looks up at Bilbo in misery. \u201cThey won\u2019t stop. They keep just giggling on over there, Bilbo. It\u2019s draining me. I can feel the will to go on leaving my broken body with every insipid little muttering!\u201dBilbo tsks at him and gingerly pats him on the arm. \u201cNow, Fili, I think it\u2019s, uh \u2026 well it\u2019s very nice. We could use some laughing after all this.\u201d He looks up and nearly jumps a little, because the elf is watching him now with hazel eyes that gleam like finely polished amber.The elves \u2026 unnerve Bilbo. They\u2019re splendid and beautiful, but there\u2019s something about their stare that keeps making Bilbo want to fidget and crawl off and sit and ask them endless questions all at once. The woman is no different, though her eyes are warmer and less piercing than the pale, icy gaze of the King. She studies Bilbo, then a slow, mischievous smile curls over her lips as she absently runs long fingers through Kili\u2019s dark hair fanned on the pillow.\u201cKili was telling me about you,\u201d she says, voice rich with amusement. \u201cYou\u2019re the one, I hear, who stole the keys and took my captive charges out right under my watch.\u201dOh, is that what all the elves are going to start saying now? Bilbo clears his throat awkwardly, feeling as caught as he had done when King Thranduil had fixed him with his sharp eyes and said the same thing, though he had been far less entertained. \u201cYes \u2026 well, I still needed them, after all. And it\u2019s not like they could\u2019ve managed that well on their own.\u201dFili squawks an indignant protest and Kili begins stammering in offense overlaid by the brilliantly chiming laugh of the elf that had drawn Bilbo here.\u201cWell,\u201d Bilbo says, \u201cmy reputation precedes me again, I see, but I don\u2019t think I was introduced to you much besides all the angry yelling and arrows everywhere?\u201d He makes himself look up expectantly at the elf woman, for all that her easy, dangerous grace and bright eyes make him want to hide a bit.\u201cTauriel,\u201d she says, the word flowing like rolling water, and Kili smiles up at her like she\u2019s the most wonderful and amazing thing he\u2019s ever seen. Tauriel catches his gaze and smiles back, the warmth of all the sun caught in her face, and she gazes down at the dwarf like he is life itself.Bilbo clears his throat, feeling incredibly awkward, and looks at Fili, who gives him a look that so clearly says \u201cNow do you see?\u201d that Bilbo has to hide his laugh behind a coughing fit.\u201cAll day, Bilbo. They\u2019re like that for hours. I can\u2019t take it much longer, I really can\u2019t.\u201dBilbo chuckles and pats Fili consolingly on the hand. \u201cAhhhh, stay strong, Fili. You\u2019ll make it through.\u201d He grins and sits back. \u201cIt is good to see you alright, Fili. Very good. I was \u2026 well, I was worried there, for a bit.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t let my little brother run off to do whatever he likes, can I? Who knows\u201d\u2014Fili\u2019s lips twist into a wry smile\u2014\u201che might do something completely mad, like run off with a wood elf.\u201dTauriel\u2019s laugh carries over again, and Bilbo snorts. Fili sighs in suffering, then his face relaxes, smile small but brows furrowing a little.\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you as well, Bilbo. What of Thorin? Have you seen him? I heard he was in a bad way.\u201d\u201cThorin is \u2026\u201d Bilbo clears his throat, rubs his hand over his face and takes a few breaths, trying to keep his voice casual and not at all like Thorin has become a source of incredible panic and earth-shattering confusion. \u201cHe\u2019ll be alright, I expect. He\u2019s not quite aware yet, sleeps mostly. And whenever he wakes up he\u2014\u201d He stops again and swallows, scrubs a hand over his face again and shakes himself while the other three watch him with mild concern. \u201cHe\u2019s \u2026 well he\u2019s still feverish. Oin says he\u2019ll break through alright, but he mostly just talks, uh. Nonsense. Utter nonsense. He\u2019ll ramble a bit and then pass back out.\u201dFili looks at him with such a small, sympathetic smile that a mad part of Bilbo wonders if he knows what sort of strange madness Thorin has been spewing. He shakes off that thought quickly. There\u2019s no way anyone else could have known about all \u2026 all the nonsense.\u201cHe\u2019ll be alright,\u201d Kili says firmly. \u201cHe\u2019s too stubborn to die on a cot.\u201dBilbo\u2019s laugh is a little hysterical, and he quickly calms it down with a flurry of little coughs, ignoring the odd look the others give him at his outburst.\u201cRight \u2026 right, that\u2019s Thorin. Stubborn to a fault.\u201d------------------------------------\u201cYou know, I think I\u2019m actually getting the hang of this.\u201dHe says this as he awkwardly manages a flail that knocks Thorin\u2019s slow jab to the side. Thorin raises his eyebrows and flips the sword around in his grip without a hitch. Bilbo knows he\u2019s being babied at an almost embarrassing level. Every swing is obvious and the parries slow and steady as Thorin takes Bilbo through maneuver after repeated maneuver.Bilbo would protest for the sake of his pride, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he still keeps ending up knocked to the ground within minutes.\u201cNo, really!\u201d Bilbo huffs, forcing his feet through the sidesteps and moving from parry to parry. \u201cThis isn\u2019t so bad really. Bit like dancing. Though maybe shouldn\u2019t compare it to that. I was always just, just awful at dancing. Did I ever\u2014whoa!\u201d He nearly trips over himself as he dodges another swing and laughs when he keeps his footing and blocks the secondary swing. \u201cAahhaaaa!\u201d He waggles his sword in triumph, grin only growing at Thorin\u2019s unimpressed eyebrows. \u201cAlllmost had me there, eh? As I was saying, did I tell you about the time Arabelia Brandybuck tried to take me dancing when I was just a tween lad?\u201dThorin isn\u2019t reacting at all to what Bilbo\u2019s saying, of course. But it\u2019s calming, in a weird way: the useless prattling makes him feel like he\u2019s more at home. It\u2019s a nervous habit, but something about the casual chattering makes it feel like this isn\u2019t practice for a battle that could leave him in a very unpleasant state.\u201cIt was just \u2026 well it was terrible.\u201d He whups again as his sword is nearly knocked from his hand. \u201cI think I must have stepped on her feet about ten times. And she wouldn\u2019t talk to me for days after!\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like that interesting of a girl, then,\u201d Thorin replies easily, and it\u2019s such a shock that Bilbo can\u2019t begin to react to the sudden rush-in and twist Thorin does, swooping behind Bilbo and hooking a leg behind his knee to send him crashing down onto his back. He yelps when Thorin\u2019s leather-wrapped sword points at his chest.Thorin raises his eyebrows and looks down at him. \u201cYou talk too much. I don\u2019t even need to bother distracting you when you do it just fine yourself.\u201dLater, there\u2019s a small goblin raid, and there\u2019s a white noise in Bilbo\u2019s head that always seems to come and cover Bilbo in an oddly fuzzed, numb feeling whenever something like this happens. And there\u2019s the usual frenzy of the dwarves working like a complicated machine. All the constant drilling from Thorin is finally coming through, though Bilbo still feels like an awkward, slashing disaster compared to the whirlwind of fury that is Thorin.He\u2019s found his own tactic for battle, however.\u201cAnd then there\u2019s this particular move which I\u201d\u2014Bilbo flicks his sword lightly, knocking the goblin\u2019s spear and jumping back from the return swing at the same time\u2014\u201cam quite fond of! Now then what you usually do as a counter\u2014\u201d He jumps back again. \u201cNoooo! No, no, not like that. You need to answer it with a Handrilian Guard Parry!\u201dThere is no such thing as a Handrilian Guard Parry. Bilbo hasn\u2019t the slightest idea what he\u2019s talking about; he\u2019s barely somewhat functional with a sword now after a few months of practice with Thorin. But the goblin stops and stares at him with its face twisted up in what Bilbo assumes is confusion.Bilbo keeps his sword up, waiting to see if the goblin will lower its guard a bit. \u201cNow, now you see, what you need to do is, uh. Well, your footwork. Your footwork is just atrocious.\u201d Bilbo snorts and shakes his head, not moving his eyes from the goblin\u2019s weapon. \u201cIt\u2019s almost embarrassing, really. I would be embarrassed. I am embarrassed, actually.\u201d The goblin squints at him, and from somewhere behind them there\u2019s an odd choking sound.\u201cSo what you do is\u2014\u201d\u201cBURGLAR!\u201d Thorin\u2019s voice bellows out behind him, \u201cSHUT UP!\u201dBilbo jumps a bit, but the goblin\u2019s head whips around in confusion, enough of a pause that Bilbo can lunge forward and shove his blade through its chest with a yell.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe takes a bit of effort to yank the sword free, making a face at the wet, sloppy crunch it makes on the way out. When he looks up, Thorin is standing there staring at him like he\u2019s the maddest and most unnerving thing he\u2019s ever seen.\n\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Thorin sputters, \u201cin Mahal\u2019s name, is a Handrilian Guard Parry?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Oh. That.\u201d Bilbo looks down at the goblin, sniffs, and shrugs as he looks back at Thorin. \u201cHaven\u2019t the slightest idea. He didn\u2019t either, though.\u201d\n\n\nThorin stares at him for a few more seconds in complete, amazed shock. The laugh that comes out of him seems to startle him even more, and for a few seconds he seems more confused by that than anything else, until Bilbo grins and starts chuckling back, and soon Thorin\u2019s leaning on his sword and laughing hard enough to shake his solid frame.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n-------\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnce, Bilbo happens\u2014completely by accident, mind you\u2014to wander down close to where Thorin\u2019s holed up. He can hear whispers of other voices, the splash of water, muttered curses and rustles of cloth and assumes that Thorin\u2019s bandages are being changed. \u201cHold him down now, never was the best patient of mine, even when he\u2019s lucid. Especially when he\u2019s lucid.\u201d Oin\u2019s voice drifts to him, and Bilbo can\u2019t help but smile. He\u2019d seen a bit of Thorin\u2019s reaction to fussing: snarling angrily and batting everyone away after the eagles had dropped them on the Carrock. As if he thought he would be just fine walking off getting thrown around by a warg like a chew toy. That lasted until he ended up collapsing again, as Gandalf had predicted with a surly mutter.\u201cBilbo \u2026\u201d Thorin\u2019s voice, so small and faint where it\u2019s usually demanding and sure, breaks Bilbo from his thoughts.\u201cAnd will someone find Master Baggins already?\u201d Oin sighs, and Bilbo feels a jolt of panic. There\u2019s cool metal around his finger before he\u2019s even aware he\u2019s reaching for the ring, enveloping him in surreal light as he quickly hurries away from the dwarvish mutterings and the soft whispers of their King.It\u2019s tempting to keep the ring on. Sometimes all he wants to do is disappear and wander as he pleases where no one will talk to him or ask him questions or make him think about unpleasant ideas that make his chest constrict painfully. But each time he considers giving in, there\u2019s another wilder panic that arises, screaming against it, screaming at him to throw it away.He yanks the ring off, inhales cool air on the rubble outside the main gate of Erebor, and shoves the ring into his pocket.It\u2019s also tempting to leave before Thorin wakes up. To write a little note. Something heartfelt and easy and polite. It\u2019s been a wonderful time, minus the screaming and the fire and all the death. Really had a fantastic time almost getting killed on several occasions. Would love to do it again. Come by anytime, tea is at four. Don\u2019t bother knocking. Your friend, Bilbo.It would be easier. Turn away, flee on his pony and start the long journey home. He\u2019d leave in friendship and leave Thorin to his mad, fevered babblings. Leave Bilbo to his fantasy of the unobtainable dwarven king, made to be admired from afar. Out of reach, out of possibility, simple and uncomplicated. He would be safe to tell tales of the dashing, dark-haired dwarf that everyone could fall a little in love with, because that was what one did with legends. And he could pretend that his nice and easy little world hadn\u2019t been upended by mad talk that he couldn\u2019t even fully trust.He fingers the cool metal collar under his shirt. The mithril is so lightweight that he sometimes forgets that he\u2019s wearing it, and it\u2019s become a regular part of his outfit. He wonders, briefly, how he\u2019d look to the folks in the Shire. His hobbit shirt and breeches, dirty and threadbare now, the buttons on his lovely deep green vest mostly gone. A shining shirt of priceless metal, a scuffed-up and soot-smeared jacket from the men of Lake-town, far too large and belted shut with a thick dwarven belt, an elvish blade hanging from his hip.\u201cNot the least bit respectable,\u201d he whispers with a small smile, and turns to walk back into the mountain.-------------------------\u201cIt is a good blade, even if it is a bit small.\u201dThorin\u2019s sitting so close to him that their shoulders are brushing: a bit of warmth in the cold, dank cabin of Lake-town as they wait for night to fall.\u201cEven if a letter opener is the only weapon we\u2019re left with right now?\u201d Bilbo asks mildly, still feeling just a little proud that he\u2019s the only one who managed to keep a hold on his sword, which he\u2019s gotten very fond of.Thorin\u2019s lips twitch up at the corners. \u201cI don\u2019t worry so much about the length of the blade. I worry much more about the one using it.\u201d\u201cI should shove you back into the barrels!\u201d Bilbo snaps. \u201cSit in a bit of fish guts and see what you have to say about my blade skills then!\u201dThorin chuckles, leaning easily in his chair. \u201cBarrels,\u201d he says, shaking his head and smiling at the fire. \u201cHow on earth did you think of barrels? I never doubted you\u2019d get us out of there for a second, but that was hardly the way I would have ever thought of going about it. I believe you\u2019re the only one who would be mad and brilliant enough to escape from that elvish ponce in barrels.\u201dBilbo\u2019s eyebrows shoot up, and he lays his sword in his lap, feeling an odd bubble in his chest. \u201cYou \u2026 seriously thought I was going to get you out of there? Didn\u2019t you think I may have, I dunno, run off? Or was maybe lost, wandering the woods?\u201dThorin snorts, as if the very idea is hilarious, as if the oaf hadn\u2019t spent several months bemoaning how utterly useless Bilbo was. \u201cMaster Burglar, by that point you had somehow disappeared within the Goblin King\u2019s domain and come out the other end with no explanation and missing only a few buttons. You climb up and vanish in the woods and later you\u2019re leaping around like you were born in the trees, cutting us all down. So when you vanished again? No, I didn\u2019t doubt that you would pop up with no warning or reason and with an escape already in place. I\u2019ve learned well that, when you vanish, it seems to be just before you do something unexpected and incredible.\u201dBilbo swallows. Blinks rapidly. Breaks eye contact and looks into the fire. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 thank you. That\u2019s very \u2026\u201d He looks down at his sword, wipes his face, clears his throat a few times. There\u2019s that blasted bubbling in his chest again and he squashes it down firmly, frowning down at the sword in his lap. It\u2019s no use, Mister Baggins, to get yourself all worked up over some praise. Don\u2019t be that swooning fool in all the stories. No good can come of that.\u201cI named it, you know,\u201d he says, looking up and keeping his voice light. Thorin\u2019s still got the little hints of a smile and raises his eyebrows expectantly.\u201cDid you?\u201dBilbo holds the sword up before him, watching the way the firelight flickers and dances over the fluid curves of the blade, catching in the elvish scrawl lacing its way over it like the veins of a leaf. He feels a smile tug at his lips, a bit different from usual: it feels slightly darker, a little more confident. It settles in place when he thinks back on the spiders screaming. \u201cSting,\u201d he says softly, pleased still with the title.Thorin doesn\u2019t answer, and when Bilbo looks up, the smile is gone, but Thorin\u2019s still staring at him, looking surprised but strangely intense. Bilbo looks away quickly and clears his throat. \u201cI got the idea from the spiders,\u201d he says quickly. Then he realizes that he could only hear them speaking while he had the ring on and quickly adds a lie. \u201cFrom \u2026 y\u2019know. Their stingers. I got one in the trees and the idea hit me.\u201d\u201cYou killed one of the spiders?\u201d Thorin asks, voice unreadable.Bilbo clears his throat awkwardly. \u201cI \u2026 wasn\u2019t really counting them. Actually.\u201dThorin\u2019s eyebrows go up.\u201cWell it\u2019s a lot easier to manage if you don\u2019t go shouting and charging at them!\u201d Bilbo points out, feeling pinned under the fierce look Thorin\u2019s got trained on him. Thorin blinks, then sits back with a huffing exhale of a laugh, shaking his head. \u201cAnd the surprises never cease,\u201d he says, almost to himself, before pushing up out of his chair and giving Bilbo\u2019s shoulder a quick, friendly grab as he walks by. \u201cIt\u2019s a good name, Master Baggins. I\u2019ve no doubt it\u2019s earned it in your hands.\u201d-------------------------------------Three days of wandering the mountain and Dale have passed by when he hears that Thorin\u2019s actually awake. He\u2019s been sneaking around so well that word doesn\u2019t even get to him directly, but is overheard as he sits tucked within a small pile of rubble. An exchange of words from unfamiliar dwarf voices that drift off as they continue walking.Bilbo taps a sharp, rapid beat against his knee and he chews his lip, heart suddenly pounding near out of his chest. Thorin\u2019s awake.Thorin\u2019s awake, and no longer madly babbling, and Bilbo can finally get an explanation for all this rush of confusion he\u2019s been thrown into. It\u2019s what he\u2019s been waiting for, pacing around in anticipation of it, for three days. But now that it\u2019s here, now that his answers are so close, he\u2019s paralyzed and staring at his knees with growing frustration.He could pretend none of it happened. That\u2019s a good option. He could just smile and say it\u2019s good to see Thorin back to himself, and he could slip back into the way it was.\u201cNot bloody likely,\u201d he mutters with a grimace. Thorin had to go and stir things up, had to make Bilbo wonder, and now Bilbo has to go up and face what will probably be either complete confusion or awkward rejection. At least he can count on Thorin to try and do it gently.He can still be angry that he has to do this at all, though.\u201cRight,\u201d he snaps, nodding to himself and shoving himself up. \u201cRight,\u201d he repeats, marching firmly into the mountain. He knows enough of the maze-like passages by now to make a straight shot for Thorin\u2019s room, ignoring any passing friends who seem smart enough to move out of his way at the scowl he has growing over his face.By the time he reaches the door, he\u2019s worked himself up into a nice fury, which suits his purposes just fine. Anger is fairly easy to deal with, all things considered.Thorin\u2019s up. Sitting up against the headboard of the plain bed that was thrown together for his recovery, his entire abdomen wrapped in bandages and his skin pale, but healthier-looking than he\u2019s been in a long time. Gandalf sits in a chair by the bed, and both look over when Bilbo storms into the room.Thorin freezes.Gandalf smiles, warm and amiable and far too entertained as he chuckles and gets up. \u201cWell, well, Master Hobbit! Good to see you, as always.\u201d He sweeps by, unmoved by the betrayed look Thorin gives him on the way out, as well as by the scowl Bilbo has fixed firmly on the dwarf who has made his life hell for the past three days. Bilbo only huffs as Gandalf pats him on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sure you two have much to discuss.\u201d The wizard chuckles, putting on his hat and laughing as he goes out the door.The door shuts, and Bilbo scowls on. Thorin actually fidgets, which in any other situation would be hilariously out of the ordinary, but now he plucks at the blanket and watches Bilbo warily and it just makes the hobbit want to knock that fool, troublemaking head a bit more.\u201cRight,\u201d Bilbo says, taking a deep breath and stalking towards the bed. \u201cRight then. Mister Thorin Oakenshield.\u201d\u201cBilbo,\u201d Thorin replies cautiously, watching Bilbo\u2019s approach like he would a hostile combatant. His face is unusually schooled, or at least it looks like he\u2019s trying for schooled and collected. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 good to see you are well.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Bilbo snaps, now standing next to the bed. \u201cDon\u2019t. Give me that. You.\u201d He points at Thorin, who eyes his finger like it\u2019s a sword. \u201cYou. You kissed me.\u201dThorin blinks, very slowly, and his face is blank as he hesitantly looks up at Bilbo. \u201cNo I didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cOh yes you most certainly did!\u201d Bilbo yells. \u201cTrust me on this one, I was actually awake for it!\u201dThorin swallows and just looks up miserably at Bilbo.\u201cJust \u2026 where is this coming from?\u201d Bilbo goes on, feeling the panic grab his chest again. \u201cYou pulling that! And everything else you were spouting off! I nearly watched you die and I had to deal with that, I had to sit there and hold your insides in where they\u2019re supposed to be and I had to deal with that and then\u2014you! You!\u201d Thorin\u2019s wide eyes are unreadable, and the rage leaves Bilbo in a rush so sudden and wiping that his knees weaken and he sits heavily on the edge of the bed, scrubbing a hand over his face as it all rushes over him. The terror of Thorin\u2019s rage, the rush of seeing him back out, out of his king\u2019s regalia and sword back in hand. Terror again as he heard Thorin\u2019s rattling breath and felt the blood pushing up against his palm.\u201cYou nearly died up there,\u201d he says weakly. \u201cYou nearly died and I didn\u2019t \u2026 after everything else, I\u2019d never thought of you dying at the end. You were always supposed to \u2026 to just be. Somehow. And I never took a chance to even think of, of any of that!\u201d\u201cAny of what?\u201d Thorin asks, voice quiet.\u201cThis!\u201d Bilbo snaps again, waving his hand generally at Thorin. \u201cYou! You kept waking up and, and saying things! And then in the mountain you were all\u2014\u201d He hears Thorin\u2019s sharp intake of breath right as the cold memory grabs at him, and Bilbo shakes himself off, mentally brushing all that away. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been you. It\u2019s all too much. It\u2019s all too much at once.\u201dHe feels his eyes burning and quickly scrubs them with the back of one sleeve and tries to get control of his breathing. But he just can\u2019t. He can\u2019t deal with any of this or even get a chance to sit and breathe and think.The hand in his lap is enveloped by a large, warm, calloused palm, thick fingers curling gently around his, and his breath is stuck in his lungs and refuses to budge or do anything useful.\u201cI meant it,\u201d Thorin says, voice soft. Softer than Bilbo\u2019s ever heard before. \u201cAll of it.\u201dBilbo chances a look out the corner of his eye and instantly regrets it. Thorin\u2019s leaning forward, reaching out to hold his hand, and his eyes are too bright, too full of \u2026 of everything. They\u2019re full and warm and sparkling and fully directed at Bilbo.\u201cThorin\u2014\u201d\u201cI meant all of it,\u201d Thorin repeats, now reaching forward and taking Bilbo\u2019s hand in both of his, covering it completely and pulling it closer to him as he looks up at Bilbo with a reverence that the hobbit can\u2019t begin to accept. \u201cBilbo, even in my deepest madness, in my darkest time when I thought my kin were against me, I never thought to suspect you. Even then, through the sickness, I knew there was no darkness in you, that you were nothing but good. I\u2019ve known it for a long time now. You\u2019re the most \u2026 good, warm, and bright thing I\u2019ve ever known. And that knowledge and surety stayed strong even against the dragon\u2019s curse.\u201d\u201cYou never said anything,\u201d Bilbo points out faintly.\u201cI had a few other things on my mind.\u201d Thorin\u2019s smile is wry. \u201cThere were several more pressing concerns than love or romance.\u201dBilbo hadn\u2019t prepared himself for actually hearing Thorin say the word, and the sound he makes is embarrassingly pained and strangled. This doesn\u2019t happen. This is against everything he\u2019s built up, everything he\u2019s worked to keep down, and now it\u2019s like a war hammer beating against his chest. \u201cYou \u2026 called me your, uh.\u201d He swallows and looks away, swallows again when Thorin\u2019s large hands press in more around his one small one. \u201cYour, uh \u2026 betrothed. When you first woke up. Something with the, uh. Mithril.\u201dThorin winces, but doesn\u2019t move back an inch. \u201cAn unfortunate miscommunication between cultures, and a gesture that was a bit rushed due to my state at the time.\u201d\u201cYou \u2026 seriously don\u2019t actually mean \u2026 that was \u2026?\u201dThorin shakes his head and laughs a little breathlessly. \u201cI gave you the second most valuable thing in my hoard, in the middle of dragon sickness, and you suspected nothing?\u201d\u201cI thought it was a very nice gesture!\u201d Bilbo says weakly, voice cracking a bit on the end.\u201cA gift,\u201d Thorin says, staring in Bilbo\u2019s eyes with such intense focus that Bilbo couldn\u2019t look away if he wanted to, which he very much does. \u201cGiven, witnessed and accepted. Something of great value and symbolism. A token of binding.\u201d\u201cWhat,\u201d Bilbo squeaks.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for it to happen then. I hadn\u2019t planned on it. I had wanted to wait, to wait until this all was passed and I could explain it. But the heart behind it was true.\u201d The hands tighten around Bilbo\u2019s and Thorin is leaning further, eyes alight with a wrenching, bright hope. \u201cBilbo, I meant it. Stay here. Stay with me. I want you here, by my side. Naiblil'\u00e2mral\u00ea \u2026\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Bilbo quakes, heart clenching up because he doesn\u2019t want to know the answer but needs to know what word Thorin says with such hope and wonder and reverence and so much else that should never be directed at Bilbo.\nThorin finally has the decency to look a little embarrassed, though it seems a tad bit late now. \u201cI cannot give you the actual translation. It is similar to engagement.\u201d\u201cYou mean like. Marriage. Like married, marriage. Getting married. You, marrying me. You want to marry me.\u201d If he says it enough times it will start sounding less insane, he's sure. \"You, Thorin, want to marry me.\u201d\u201cI was going to wait,\u201d Thorin says again in a rush. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything now, Bilbo. Just stay here \u2026 stay with me. Think on it, with me.\u201dBilbo has to look away, has to avert his eyes from everything that\u2019s in Thorin\u2019s. Because he\u2019s never, ever, dreamed of anything like this. And there\u2019s so much in his head still. He still feels like he\u2019s drowning in the up and downs, the yanks and tears of these past few weeks straining on him, and then this. Thorin was unobtainable. It was safe. Everything was held down and away and locked up and now Thorin, with a smile and without a care, has flung it open and sent everything rushing out like a wild autumn storm. Bilbo feels his chest constricting again, his breaths jumping into short little bursts while his eyes burn and everything is too much, too much too fast and all at once. \u201cBilbo?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI can\u2019t. Thorin I can\u2019t \u2026 can\u2019t deal with this. Not right now. There\u2019s too much. I can\u2019t. I\u2014\u201dThere\u2019s a small, hitched breath, and Thorins hands slowly let go and drag away. Bilbo doesn\u2019t watch them, keeps his eyes on the floor and tries to stop his vision from swimming in front of him.\u201cI understand.\u201d Thorin\u2019s voice is flat, hollow, and when Bilbo looks over, Thorin\u2019s face matches it. Blank and staring flatly at the wall. Bilbo quickly looks away, scrubs at his eyes again with his hand, and pushes himself up. \u201cI \u2026 I\u2019m.\u201d He stops, inhales and works on finding some sort of steady mental footing. \u201cYou \u2026 you\u2019ll be a great king, Thorin.\u201dEverything feels heavy, like he\u2019s walking through molasses, thick and dragging and ringing in his ears as he approaches the door. He needs his home, needs his armchair and sunlight and some space where he can sit alone, collect himself and think. Think without the rush of the life of the dwarves, without Thorin\u2019s blue eyes full of hope and so much more.He walks out the door, and pretends not to hear the ragged, wet, broken sharp breath of sound that follows him.\n\u201cWhat are they taking so long for?\u201d Thorin mutters, frowning with all the might his eyebrows can muster at Beorn and Gandalf at the other side of the cottage.  Bilbo looks up from making the acquaintance of one of Beorn\u2019s large, quiet cows, following Thorin\u2019s line of sight and shrugging. \u201cIt looks to me,\u201d Balin says amiably, \u201cLike they are taking time to discuss, like reasonable folk, whether or not Sir Skinwalker should kick us out to the Orcs.\u201d \u201cIf he\u2019s to cast us out then be done with it. I don\u2019t see why Gandalf is taking so long sweet talking him.\u201d Thorin sulks, though Bilbo would hazard a guess that \u2018sulk\u2019 is not the word Thorin would use for it. \u2018Broods\u2019, would also be an accurate description.  \u201cBecause,\u201d Bilbo sighs, stroking Bessie\u2019s (or so he has just named her) nose and giving it a few scratches, \u201cwe burst into the man\u2019s home without invitation, and Gandalf has manners.\u201d \u201cManners,\u201d Thorin sneers, as if it was a particularly disgusting word and not a basic protocol for social interaction, \u201cwon\u2019t do us much good against dragons and orcs, Mister Baggins.\u201d (Months later, Bilbo will very nearly burst into terrified and hysterical laughter as the dragon croons \u201cYou have nice manners...\u201d) \u201cWell they\u2019ll do us good now, Mister Oakenshield!\u201d Bilbo snaps back, and he takes a moment to savor the startled look that Thorin gives him and the small approving smile from Balin. Every day Thorin opens up more around him, Bilbo is more convinced that the dwarf King was most definitely raised without being questioned much. \u201cWhich,\u201d he goes on, \u201cis why Gandalf is talking to him, and not you, I\u2019d imagine.\u201d Balin chuckles and Thorin narrows his eyes at both of them, then sends the full force of his glare back at the Wizard and bear-man. \u201cBesides,\u201d Bilbo goes on, \u201cI rather like Master Beorn, I think.\u201d Thorin\u2019s head whips around to redirect the glare back at Bilbo. \u201cHow can you have decided that?\u201d \u201cI was awake when he came back in early in the morning.\u201d Bilbo shrugs. \u201cAfter the...well...admittedly awkward introductions, we had a nice chat about gardening.\u201d Thorin looks dumbfounded, and angry because he is dumbfounded. \u201cGardening?\u201d He asks, lips curling in sneered disgust. \u201cYes, Thorin. Gardening!\u201d Bilbo throws his hands up a little, having finally decided that he has had quite enough of this attitude. Thorin may have deemed him worth being considered part of the group, and hasn\u2019t slacked in treating him like he does belong, but he also hasn\u2019t dropped the habit of finding Bilbo just to needle and scoff at him whenever the dwarf\u2019s mood drops. And Bilbo is quite done with being nervous and desperate for approval, thank you very much. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think, in this fine little chat of yours, to actually ask him if he would assist us?\u201d Thorin grits, looming over Bilbo with all the menace that, a couple months ago, would have prompted several apologies or just a quiet acceptance. Bilbo squares his shoulders and glares right back up into the posturing anger of the Dwarf King. \u201cNo! I liked his garden! It is a very lovely garden, and no one who takes that much care of the plants or animals in their care can be all that bad, so I decided he would probably be alright to try chatting with. And he was! And he gave me some wonderful tips on how to get better results from my strawberry patch and how to keep the bugs off my roses! And it was lovely and I fully intend on inviting him for tea after all this is done!\u201d  Thorin twitches back a little,\u201cYou\u2019re going to invite the bear for tea?\u201d He says slowly, the unspoken \u2018you grand idiot\u2019 clearly dripping from every word. \u201cI-!\u201d Bilbo starts, voice raising until he stops and realizes that they\u2019re attracting an audience. The other dwarves are nervously eyeing the pair of them, then quickly glancing away when Bilbo notices. Balin has conspicuously made himself distant from them, sitting now and talking quietly with his brother a few feet away.  \u201cI,\u201d Bilbo goes on, lowering his voice, \u201cam going to invite Beorn to tea, and I imagine he would not be a bear for it. Because that is what I do if I think someone is pleasant company. And Beorn, unlike some currently present, is very pleasant company!\u201d Thorin huffs, crosses his arms and leans against a wooden post. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him.\u201d He mutters. \u201cOh yes, that\u2019s a shocker.\u201d Bilbo snorts.  Thorin pauses, blinks the glare away and replaces with with a more confused, thoughtful frown. He tilts his head towards Bilbo, brows furrowed. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d \u201cI mean, Thorin Oakenshield, that you don\u2019t trust anybody.\u201d Thorin\u2019s mouth twitches down, his shoulders tense up and his hands clench a little bit against his arms. It\u2019s an odd expression, and Bilbo didn\u2019t know any better he\u2019d say Thorin was honestly offended.  \u201cI trust you.\u201d Thorin says finally, \u201cI trust those who follow me.\u201d He adds with a nod towards the other dwarves before Bilbo can ever process the first part. \u201cThe skin-walker,\u201d he continues, voice going sullen again, \u201cI do not trust because he has given me no reason to. Nor, for that matter, do I trust the wizard. My trust extends to those who have earned the right of it.\u201d Bilbo opens his mouth, shuts it, tries opening it on another idea, then thinks better of it. \u201cI-, ah. Right. Sorry.\u201d He settles on finally, and it feels cheap except for the small nod Thorin gives.\n\n \u00a0 \n\nThe silence that comes over them feels less stiff now, Bilbo goes back to scratching Bessie behind the ears, and Thorin not really glaring at anything, instead looking off at nothing in particular with his brows drawn together in thought. \u201cYou...you uh,\u201d Bilbo shuts his mouth and tries to find the best, not awkward way to ask this. He regrets opening his mouth in the first place, but Thorin\u2019s cocked his head to look at him expectantly so there\u2019s no pretending he didn\u2019t say anything. He decides it\u2019s best just to have it all out and blurts in a rush, \u201cYou really trust me then?\u201d Thorin lifts his brows a little, and inclines his head in a small nod, as if it were obvious. \u201cNot at first.\u201d He admits. \u201cI was not sure what Gandalf had plotted out with you, or what purpose you had for agreeing to this cause. Now?\u201d And he lowers his head slightly, something earnest and serious in the look he gives Bilbo. \u201cWith my life.\u201d\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThere\u2019s an odd bubbling in Bilbo\u2019s chest, a giddy little flutter that has him smiling with what he\u2019s sure is the stupidest expression to ever come over his face. He quickly looks back to Bessie, and runs a hand along her cheek until he can get his face under control again. \n\n\u201cThen\u2026.then trust me on this.\u201d He nods to where Gandalf and Beorn are still deep in a quiet conversation. \u201cLet them do their talking and their-\u201d he waves a hand vaguely at them, \u201ctheir manners. You can\u2019t get everything by just demanding it. And beside, even if Beorn ends up deciding not to help, everyone can rest while they work on it. The orcs can\u2019t get here, and everyone\u2019s exhausted.\u201d He turns slightly and jerks his head towards the general cabin area, where most of the other dwarves are leaning against each other or wooden posts, if they aren\u2019t outright lying within hay piles. \u201cLet those two haggle and be polite so we all can catch our breath before we go running again.\u201d Thorin looks at Bilbo for a few breaths, head tilted and eyes assessing, then scans out over his dwarves, pausing on each one. A few more moments, and he looks back at Bilbo, dips his head down in a nod, and says no more until nearly half an hour later when they\u2019re all invited to sit at the table for breakfast.\n\n\u00a0\n\n---------------------------------------------------He slips away quietly, unseen and unnoticed, leaving a little note for the others saying goodbye, and that they\u2019re welcome at any time. It feels wrong, and he can imagine their disappointed faces at his short, distantly polite message, but he can\u2019t quite face the idea of all the fussing and goodbyes.A dragon is one thing, but emotional dwarves are a challenge that Bilbo is not mentally equipped for. Not when he\u2019s still reeling from one draining and wringing encounter. Thorin\u2019s words, the glow in his eyes, his warm and rough hands, follow him all the way to Dale. There\u2019s a constant barrage of confusion and thrashing panic and questions that he couldn\u2019t imagine tamping down enough for a proper farewell.Not to mention the main question; Did they know? Thorin had said the issue with the mithril had been a \u201ccultural misunderstanding.\u201dBilbo remembers the others standing silently, watching and not saying a word as the mithril slipped over his head, and has the feeling that he managed to get himself engaged with him being the only one completely unaware. He remembers Filli\u2019s oddly sympathetic and worried smile when he asked about Thorin, and how no one seemed to question the fact that their fevered King had been asking after Bilbo.It would fit into the madness that his life had become this past year.He had at least thought to stop in Dale to meet up with Gandalf, thinking that a Wizard could be very handy on the long journey home, for either backup or pleasant conversation. He likes Gandalf. The wizard is gruff and has his own odd habits of wandering off with cryptic mutterings, but there\u2019s something rooted and simple and common in his grandness that puts Bilbo at ease no matter where they meet. It takes only two days of surly head shaking and disgusted mutterings for him to completely regret that decision.\u201cAnd what,\u201d Gandalf spits, as they ride at a leisurely pace through the foothills along the Anduin, \u201cdo you plan on doing exactly, when you get back to your nice, peaceful little hole in the ground?\"Gandalf says \u2018nice\u2019 and \u2018peaceful\u2019 like they\u2019re the basest of insults.\u201cI plan,\u201d Bilbo grits, reins creaking in his fists, \u201con making a pot of tea, in a real tea pot. Then, I\u2019m going to do some much needed dusting, sit in my cushioned armchair by a fire that won\u2019t get blown out or rained on, and just enjoy some time to myself! And then in the morning, I\u2019m going to weed my garden, which I\u2019m sure is a disaster. And I\u2019ll enjoy some quiet without worrying about what might leap out and kill me, or who\u2019s got the next watch, or any dwarves being- being...dwarves!\u201dGandalf pulls out his pipe, and mutters angrily to himself as he sets to light it. Bilbo catches the words \u201cfool dwarves\u201d and \u201cact before they think\u201d and nearly stops his pony right there.\u201cDid you know too then?\u201d He bursts out, \u201cDid everyone know but me?!\u201d\u201cKnow what, Master Baggins?\u201d Gandalf mutters around his pipe, still sounding more disgusted and done entirely than anything else.\u201cThat I got myself bloody engaged without knowing it and without anyone bothering to tell me!\u201dGandalf glances at him sidelong, and huffs out a puff of smoke. \u201cI had suspected, when I saw the mithril shirt. That is not the sort of token that any dwarf would part with easily, least of all one gone mad with dragon sickness. I decided the oncoming war was a more important matter.\u201d\u201cWhy is it that important?\u201d Bilbo wonders, tucking his chin to frown down at the bit of shining metal he can see peeking out from under his shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s silver steel.\u201d\u201cThat metal,\u201d Gandalf says impatiently, \u201cis the rarest on this world. And that \u2018silver steel\u2019 you\u2019re wearing was second only to the arkenstone in that horde.\u201dBilbo frowns, jaw setting at the fact that once again, no one tells\u00a0him these things! \u201cSo no one even thought to mention their surprise then? That Thorin had just...just handed me what was apparently a dwarven engagement ring?\u201d\u201cBilbo Baggins,\u201d Gandalf snaps, as if he\u2019s correcting a wayward student, \u201cI\u2019m sure you were the only one who would have been surprised about any of it!\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201d Bilbo tenses up so hard that the pony (Buttercup, he\u2019s called her) tosses her head and whinnies in protest, and Bilbo spends a few minutes getting her back under control while he keeps stammering. \u201cWhat do-. How-. What do you mean? What do you mean I\u2019m the only one surprised!? It\u2019s surprising! Thorin is-\u201d \u201cThorin is not subtle.\u201d Gandalf interrupts loudly. \u201cHe is not subtle in any matters, and by dwarven standards he was entirely and disgustingly besotted! I advised him to say something long ago on the matter to have it out and done with. And of course he wouldn\u2019t listen to me and was convinced that the quest had to come first!\u201d\u201cLong what- disgust-. What? How long-\u201d\u201cOf all the things,\u201d Gandalf goes on, puffing at his pipe furiously, \u201cfor him to decide to use tact on! If he had that sense of discretion in any other matter the quest could have gone far more smoothly!\u201d \u00a0Bilbo feels a little faint, he\u2019s sure. Besotted? Long ago? Disgustingly besotted? \u201cThis is...this is Thorin we are talking about? Thorin Oakenshield? Big? Surly? Tends to talk about being King a lot?\u201d Completely and entirely on a different level above Bilbo? Several levels above Bilbo? \u201cAnd we are also talking about me, here? The Shire Halfling? I can\u2019t even use a sword properly, Gandalf!\u201d\u201cYes, Bilbo!\u201d Gandalf explodes, \u201cYou and Thorin Oakenshield! The two halfwits it has been my great displeasure to have to watch dance around each other like jumpy younglings! One because he\u2019s too caught up in his grand plans of the future to think of the now, and one too caught up in his own fool insecurities to see what\u2019s happening right in front of him!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not-\u201d Bilbo stops, swallows and blinks rapidly. He\u2019s really not sure what he\u2019s protesting against at this point. Then another details strikes him. Gandalf had told Thorin long ago? Before the battle, the last time they had seen Gandalf was\u2026.\u201dHas this\u2026.has this been going on since before we entered Mirkwood?\u201d\u201cGreenwood.\u201d Gandalf snorts, \u201cDon\u2019t let any of the elves hear you calling it that when we pass through it, Master Hobbit. And yes.\u201d Gandalf sighs and deflates a bit, shaking his head, and goes on more gently. \u201cYes, Bilbo. That at least was when I noticed that Thorin had fallen absurdly in love with you.\u201dBilbo has to work a bit to swallow after that. In Love. Thorin had already used that heavy word once, but Bilbo hadn\u2019t had to hear it said by anyone with that sure finality. Thorin in love with him. His first instinct is to laugh it off because really, Thorin, in love with Bilbo. But he can\u2019t really brush it away after Thorin had spouted out all of that\u2026marriage talk, can he?So, there it was then. All out there. Thorin was in love with Bilbo. There was no more denying that fact, no matter how mad it seemed.Was Bilbo in love with Thorin?\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not a line of thought he had ever let himself wander down. He knew he was something with Thorin. He knows that his world feels brighter for Thorin\u2019s having been in it, that Thorin\u2019s smiles lit something up in Bilbo\u2019s chest like the searing forges, that Thorin made him feel more like himself than he had in decades. He had been used to being Mister Baggins, the title and all that was with it. With Thorin he was Bilbo, and all that he had grown into that.But love still seemed like something that was so beyond what Bilbo could hope to reach. He still had trouble wrapping his mind around what love with Thorin would be like, still reeling from the reality of it all too much to feel safe putting those words down.\u201cI need time on it, Gandalf.\u201d He finally says. \u201cThorin\u2019s apparently spent months thinking this out and, and very obviously planning on it. But I just...this has been within days that he threw this all on me! I need time to think. To...to sort myself out. In my own space.\u201dGandalf snorts again, mutters something and shakes his head, but doesn\u2019t prod or push at it anymore.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u201cSo what about Erebor?\u201dAnother quiet, calm night, another night with Bilbo sitting back against a thin tree trunk, looking up at the sky with Thorin\u2019s quiet company. It\u2019s the dwarf\u2019s watch this time, and Thorin stands and leans against another section of the tree, eyes sharp and scanning as he looks out over the hills and occasionally glances back to his troupe. He doesn\u2019t stop at Bilbo\u2019s question, but he does pause, and slightly tilt his head down in the hobbits direction without actually looking that way.\u201cWhat of it?\u201d He asks, cautious and wary.\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Thorin\u2019s response is instant and growling. \u201cIt lies in dragonfire and ruin.\u201dBilbo doesn\u2019t smack him on the leg, but it\u2019s a close thing. \u201cI know about all that you idiot. I\u2019ve gotten pretty familiar with the dragons and the burning and incineration and death and ruin bits. I\u2019m talking about before all that. What was it like?\u201dThorin\u2019s silhouetted by the moonlight, so Bilbo can\u2019t see his face. But he does see the way Thorin tenses up, tilts his head to look in Bilbo\u2019s direction now. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI mean,\u201d Bilbo huffs, rolling his eyes now. Dwarves. \u201cI mean, what was it like when you were there? When it wasn\u2019t some grand distant lost homeland but just...a home?\u201dHe still can\u2019t see Thorin\u2019s face, but he hears the slow, steady exhale and marks the long quiet. Thorin stares out into the distance again, face now hidden by his thick curtain of hair and the silence goes on. It drags on so long that Bilbo starts to fidget and grow uncomfortable with it, it\u2019s a different sort than the usual calm quiet between them.He\u2019s opening his mouth to start apologizing for prying where he shouldn\u2019t be, because it\u2019s really not his place, not his business, when Thorin slides down the tree and sits heavily by him, forearms braced on his knees and staring forward at nothing in particular.\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d He asks, and there\u2019s no blame or anger in his voice. Nothing suspicious. It\u2019s soft and confused, almost vulnerably so, and it\u2019s the most honest thing Bilbo\u2019s heard from him since he had said \u2018I\u2019ve never been more wrong in my life.\u2019\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I care?\u201dThorin grips his hands together, tucked up and guarded where he sits. \u201cThis is not your homeland. It\u2019s not your stories. You knew nothing of Erebor before you signed your contract to me. You have no reason to care for what it was.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a home, isn\u2019t it? Or was.\u201d Bilbo sighs a little when Thorin jerks his head slightly in his direction, hands tense and still not really looking at Bilbo. \u201cI mean...honestly I don\u2019t really need all the treasure. I\u2019ve my house, the name of Baggins behind me, all the prestige and nonsense that goes with that. A bit of gold wouldn\u2019t do me much good. I don\u2019t care about all that too much. But...but it\u2019s like I said. When I came back. This is a home, and I don\u2019t know it but it\u2019s your home. That\u2019s worth this daft journey, I think. And if I\u2019m going to be facing fire and death and ruin and all that bit, I\u2019d like knowing why. Why it all matters so much.\u201dMore silence. When Bilbo glances over, Thorin is completely still, head angled in Bilbo\u2019s direction, hand fisted in front of him. It drags on, grow heavy and oppressive and Bilbo starts fidgeting with the ring in his pocket. It\u2019s become a bit of a worry stone for him, and he rolls the always warm gold between his fingertips and feels the growing tension.\u201cLook, sorry.\u201d He says finally, starting to push himself up to give Thorin some space. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s not...it\u2019s not really my business. \u00a0I didn\u2019t-\u201dA hand grabs him by the shirtsleeve, just a few fingers grasping the cuff, and tugs him back down to where he was. Bilbo stares as he sits again, and Thorin quickly pulls the hand back as soon as he does like it never happened.\u201cWhen I was small,\u201d Thorin says, voice soft and distant in memory, \u201cI was always sneaking out onto the walls. Or into the great mines and forges. And I was always getting into trouble, dragging my sister with me to look at the rivers of gold through the rock beneath the mountain city.\u201dBilbo leans against the tree, smiling at the idea of a small Thorin, willful and serious as ever no doubt. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a sister.\u201d\u201cFilli and Killi\u2019s mother, Dis. And as fine a daughter of Durin as there ever was.\u201d There\u2019s a small puffing breath that Bilbo thinks may be a laugh, and his own smile grows. Thorin is always so terse and filling the role of company leader, that it\u2019s easy to forget that to some of these dwarves he\u2019s family. \u201cDis didn\u2019t have the same pressure as I, when we were young. She wasn\u2019t the firstborn, and I often used her willful spirit as an excuse to escape. It was a lot easier to sneak out onto the ramparts, to watch the clouds in the sky, if I could say I was chasing after my sister.\u201d\u201cI can just imagine,\u201d Bilbo chuckles, \u201cyou as a kid. Shire\u2019s hills you must have been the worst little handful to manage. If you were half as stubborn then\u2026\u201d Thorin laughs softly, and Bilbo can see how he relaxes back, hands unclenching and head leaning back on the trunk of the tree.\u201cI did not handle direct orders well, no. And I did not take well to confinement. The mountain was always...so vast. It felt larger than the entire world. You\u2019ll understand, when you see it. You could stand on the ground level and look up and only see neverending staircases and archways, doors and lights shining like stars within the stone, stretching forever upwards. There was always light, always warmth from the forges below. The seams of gold in the upper levels were left in the mountain, and there were great scenes of our history and legend carved into them, glowing with the light of braziers and torches all around. You would think a mountain would be cold, wet stone. But it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Thorin\u2019s voice trails off as he looks out over the distance, finally adding a whisper that Bilbo doesn\u2019t think is really meant for anyone, too lost in the memories and feel of a home long gone. \u201cIt was always warm and light and forever vast.\u201dBilbo\u2019s smile only grows, and for once he doesn\u2019t take the time to stomp down the warm flush through his chest as he watches the small smile on Thorin\u2019s face, lit by the flickering light of the campfire a ways away.\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see it then.\u201d He says gently, smiling wider when Thorin turns his head to look at him in near surprise. \u201cTruly. It sounds wonderful, Thorin.\u201d\u201cIt is.\u201d Thorin says slowly, watching Bilbo with the wide, unreadable expression that he\u2019s becoming familiar with. His eyes flit over Bilbo for a bit and his eyebrows come together just slightly, as if he\u2019s working through several thoughts and can\u2019t decide which to land on. His hands clench up again, tension slowly returning. \u201cBilbo\u2026\u201d\u201cHm? Something the matter?\u201dThorin clenches his jaw, mouth set in a straight line, then lets out a slow breath through his nose. He pushes himself back up to his feet suddenly, voice gruff. \u201cGet some rest. I may have your keen eyes for the next watch, and we have another long day tomorrow.\u201d--------------------------------------------------------\n\u201cWho was this person you pledged your services to? This \u2018Thorin Oakenshield\u2019?\u201dHe nearly bursts out laughing. What an excellent question. After all this nonsense, after coming home to ransacking and absolute chaos hidden with polite little greetings and curious stares. That is just the question of the century.\u201cHe\u2026..he\u2019s my friend.\u201d Bilbo settles on, shaking his head and adjusting his shield (he had never thought to tone himself down a bit before walking into the shire. Didn\u2019t even cross his mind.) and walks through his door.It takes over a week before he can really say that he\u2019s home again. One week of using the money collected during the breaking down of Bag End to hunt down at least his favorite items. His mother\u2019s box, the chair his father had made, the stupid doilies. And he\u2019s finding that he seems to have left what little patience he had somewhere in Erebor.\u201cWhy, Mister Baggins! I understand it\u2019s been a difficult time for you, but I still payed good money for these here chairs I did.\u201dBilbo rubs his forehead and breathes in slowly. \u201cRight yes I\u2019m sure you did, all four coins was hard spent I\u2019m sure.\u201d He snaps. \u201cBut you bought those while I was presumed dead, which you can see, since I am here to want the chairs back, that I am definitely not! And I\u2019m paying you back for them!\u201dRido Hartford shakes his head, with a little frown so simpering that Bilbo is almost tempted to just knock it in and be done with it. \u201cIt\u2019s dreadful business Mister Baggins, it really is.\u201d\u201cYes! Quite dreadful seeing my furniture spread all over the Shire! That was wonderful to come home to!\u201d He shoves the four coins into the portly hobbit\u2019s hands and grabs the chair before anything else can be said, ignoring the shocked sputtering as he storms off with his damned property.It\u2019s a scene that\u2019s been repeated several times over. Even when they\u2019re more cooperative, Bilbo has trouble keeping his temper around the hobbits and their damned need to just act like everything is sunshine and roses constantly.\u201cWhy Mister Bilbo, won\u2019t you sit down for a bit? We\u2019ve just started putting dinner on!\u201dLorri Boffin is all warm smiles and her mother fusses around while Bilbo tries to think of any excuse to get away from an evening of polite conversation. \u201cThank you, Miss Boffin, but I really-\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten far too thin, you have.\u201d The older woman interrupts, \u201cNasty business just nasty, these adventures. Takes the flesh right off you! Don\u2019t you fret Mister Baggins. I\u2019ve got a lovely pudding that everyone can\u2019t get enough of I does. We\u2019ll get you looking like a proper hobbit again in no time! Put all that irregularity right behind! I always did say no proper hobbit-\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a proper hobbit then!\u201d Bilbo snaps, then instantly winces and regrets it at the shocked looks. He really can\u2019t be taking everything out on each poor soul who crosses his path. \u201cSorry, Misses Boffin. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just been-\u201d\u201cOh you poor dear.\u201d She pats him on the arm while Lori looks on with a much more forced and nervous smile. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to have you back home and proper Mister Baggins. It must have been just dreadful, being dragged about by all them dwarves. No manners to them, none at all. But it\u2019s all done with and over now eh? You\u2019ll be back to yourself in no time at all, just you wait and see.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d He says weakly. That may be exactly what the problem is. He\u2019s been more himself than he ever was, and now isn\u2019t quite sure how to go back to being Mister Baggins. It\u2019s wonderful, being clean and dressed in fine soft cottons and well embroidered velvets again, being able to cook his meals as he wants them with his kitchen utensils, smoking his pipe without feeling grit sunk into his skin and worrying if there may be goblin blood in the bowl of it. That\u2019s all be lovely. But as soon as he steps out the door\u2026\u201cRight\u2026\u201d he says again. \u201cI just need to...right. Sorry, Misses Boffin I uh, I really do have another...previous engagement. I\u2019ll have to try that pudding some other time, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s delightful.\u201dNot everyone is so forgiving of his little foray into the not-so-proper or respectable.\u201cMister Baggins you open this door this instant!\u201dCamellia Sackville, second only to her daughter-in-law Lobelia in sheer unpleasantness. And outranking her in stubborn vitriol. She\u2019ll be there for hours if he tries to ignore her. Bilbo sets his jaw and yanks open the door with a grin that is all teeth.\u201cWhy, Misses Sackville, what a lovely surprise.\u201d He grits, and shows more teeth at the sneer on the old woman\u2019s face.\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018lovely surprise\u2019 me! After what you\u2019ve done to our good family name!\u201d\u201cIf I recall correctly,\u201d Bilbo says slowly, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to the Sackville-Baggins name.\u201d It\u2019s a low blow, but it\u2019s entirely worth it for the way her face contorts in shock. Always so bitter that they couldn\u2019t get Bag End.\u201cYou have brought disgrace! Going off on adventures! You\u2019ve changed and you\u2019ve dragged the Baggins name into the mud with you! It\u2019s a travesty, seeing you in this good house after you go running off with dwarves and wander back in looking like that!\u201dBilbo leans against the curve of his doorway and raises his eyebrows in mock interest. \u201cMust be dreadful, so sorry about all the racket.\u201d \u201cI knew it was a bad match! Just knew it! Bungo running off with that wild Took woman! The name was good but there\u2019s odd blood in that family and now-\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask you,\u201d Bilbo says, voice soft and steady, \u201cnot to speak of my parents that way, Misses Sackville. Especially not my mother.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re no proper Baggins! If you ask me you should have stayed lost in the wilds with that dwarvish rabble and left the house and the name to those who would honor it!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave now.\u201d Bilbo grits.\u201cI won\u2019t be leaving till I\u2019ve spoken my mind sir! You are selfish, disrespectful, downright odd and unruly and-\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201d Bilbo interrupts, leaning forward and baring his teeth. \u201cI learned some very interesting things while wandering about with the dwarvish rabble. Really enlightening, it all was. Did you happen to see the sword when I came back? Lovely elvish thing it is, gotten quite fond of it. Unfortunately I\u2019ve picked up a few bad habits from the dwarves as well. It\u2019s really dreadful. Things like the fact that I really, really, do not take it well when my kin or my home is disrespected. It gets nasty.\u201dHe\u2019s going to regret that. He knows he is but oh is it worth it for the way her face pales and her mouth gapes in shock. The old woman sputters for a bit before gathering her skirts and quickly hurrying away, looking back in alarm when Bilbo bursts out laughing as he shuts the door.----------------------------------------This is what their quest was for, the dragon dead, the reclaiming of the mountain, crowning Thorin as king. This is what he had signed in to see done.It doesn\u2019t stop the sick twist of unease in his stomach, as Bilbo stands along the walkway leading up to the throne with the others. It started as a little niggling doubt, watching Thorin stare at the mountain as Laketown screamed and burned in the distance. Watching Thorin near shivering with some unnamed emotion as they walked into the treasure halls, his eyes wide and bright.Now he watches Thorin march down towards the throne, where Balin waits with the crown, and the twisting doubt grows on. The dwarf has found the kings chambers, decked himself in the layers of fur and silk and gold that swamp him in clinking finery. Bilbo feels like Thorin\u2019s disappearing under the huge cloak, like the dwarf he\u2019s known has been smothered away by title and fire. The steady warmth in Thorin\u2019s eyes has been replaced by a burning, by the manic gleam and nervous clenching of his hand and set of his jaw as he marches to his throne, eyes fixed firmly on the empty space where the arkenstone should be.He should hand it to him. It\u2019s everything Thorin wants, everything Thorin\u2019s been grasping for. And it\u2019s warm and heavy tucked within Bilbo\u2019s coat and he knows he should give it to Thorin. He wants to give it to Thorin. Wants to be the one who found it, wants to see the dwarf\u2019s face light up as Bilbo hands him the one thing he wants above all else and then-...And then what? Bilbo keeps his hands clasped in front of him, keeps his mouth shut, and keeps the arkenstone tucked away. Something is wrong.The other dwarves bow to their king as Thorin marches by each of them, his eyes not on his kin who got him here, but ever on the throne. Bilbo swallows down his unease and tilts his head as well as Thorin approaches to pass him.Thorin stops, and Bilbo sets his jaw, wondering what on earth is going on this time. He doesn\u2019t need to bow, Thorin is a king, but not his king.He keeps his eyes on the stone at his feet, and jumps a bit when the hand comes around to rest on his back. He looks up, and Thorin jerks his head, then sets his eyes back on the throne, a hand heavily adorned with rings pressed full against the small of Bilbo\u2019s back, steering him wordlessly up the stairs to the dias. Bilbo lets the hand guide him and blinks rapidly, feeling something knot up in his chest and join the twisting in his gut. The touch isn\u2019t unusual, he\u2019s been led before by a broad hand on his back. A gentle nudge here, a pat on the shoulder, a friendly clasp, a hand reaching out and pressing against him while a voice yells at him to run.This is just the first time that he\u2019s wanted to cringe away from the touch, feeling something dark and wrong in it, instead of the usual comfort. Thorin leads him to a spot to the side of the throne and stops then, turning to face Bilbo, who frowns in confusion because he really doesn\u2019t belong here. What on earth is he doing up here?The hand pulls away, then reaches up to grasp Bilbo by the back of the neck, grab his attention and firmly root him where he is. Bilbo\u2019s breath stops in his lungs and his heart pounds, every instinct screaming at him to run away while he just freezes up and stares with wide eyes at Thorin\u2019s burning gaze.\u201cThis,\u201d Thorin says, tightening his fingers briefly to empathize his words, \u201cright here, is where I want you to be. Whenever I\u2019m on the throne, you\u2019re to stand here. Is that understood?\u201dBilbo nods quickly, brows furrowed in utter confusion but not daring to question the huge stranger in front of him. Thorin nods, releases Bilbo, and the hobbit quickly inhales a breath, feeling oddly like he\u2019s faced down Smaug again. As he looks up, he meets Balin\u2019s eyes, and is stopped short by the pained look on the old dwarf\u2019s face, the white knuckles on the crown and the sadness in his eyes as he meets Bilbo\u2019s. Balin shakes his head, just slightly, and they both turn their attention back to the King. He watches Thorin, frowning at the idea, at the return of that tensed dread that the dragon gave him, while the crown is lowered onto his friend\u2019s head.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHe weeds his garden. Feels the soil beneath his hands and tries not to think about the fact that this is the only place he really can feel home. It\u2019s hard work, most of his plants overrun by over a year\u2019s worth of weeds and grasses. Brambles growing wild and unchecked, mints overrunning all his other herbs. But he can dig himself into the soil, ignore the cuts from thorns on his hands and focus on the green and growing in his palms. The acorn from Beorn\u2019s garden sits in a little box on his mantle. The bear-man had smiled at it, when Bilbo and Gandalf stopped by his little house on the way back. He\u2019d smiled and given Bilbo a whole pouch of seeds from his garden, which Bilbo cheerfully plants into the rich, black soil, while the acorn sits in it\u2019s own box.He doesn\u2019t think about that either. Thinks only on if he needs to water or not, on the sun on his back and the earth beneath his feet and the fact that he\u2019s learned that if he ignores all the cheerful greetings and \u2018good mornings\u2019 that drift up from the road, no one will talk to him. He\u2019s very firmly not thinking about the implications of that, when a crackling caw catches his attention, sharp and guttural over the soft chirping of the usual Shire birds. Bilbo looks up, and the raven looks back at him from the top of his chimney, huge and black and starkly out of place against the blue sky. The raven tilts it\u2019s head and flutters it\u2019s wings, making a series of odd squawks and trills. Bilbo\u2019s not really sure if he\u2019s supposed to understand any of it, but he remembers seeing Thorin whispering to one, months ago now, that had been sent to get Dain.\u201cYou can tell them I made it back safe.\u201d Bilbo finally says, heart pounding and hands shaking where they grip on a handful of grass he was about to pull up. The raven chitters for a few more seconds, and he knows he\u2019s being stared at, knows that it\u2019s just not regular to be talking to large birds but he can\u2019t really care as he watches the huge black wings unfurl against the bright sky and carry off one of the ravens of Erebor.Bilbo slowly breathes out, can\u2019t get his hands to stop shaking and nervously wipes the dirt off on his trousers, fingers coming to rest nervously over his pocket and press against the circle of gold that never leaves it. It was like a dream had come and interrupted the waking world, a reminder of everything that happened. He quickly goes back into the house, feeling like he needs to escape. Escape from the memories, from the pounding of his heart and from the fact that he can\u2019t really lose himself in his own head and books like he always had before. The house is quiet. Warm and silent and tidy. His footsteps feel like an intrusion, like an interruption to the quaint peace that he had always been able to run to when the world became too much. This had always been his haven, his escape, his calm and peace where no one talked to him. Even now, no one talked to him.He sits heavily in his chair, and it still holds him perfectly, still shields him with it\u2019s high back and full armrests. Bilbo picks up the book he had been flipping through, a discussion on elvish dialects through the ages, and puts it down when he remembers the glowing amber eyes of Killi\u2019s elf woman.Has Thorin found out about all that? Did Killi manage to run off with his wood elf? The clock ticks in the silence, the fire crackles against the last dregs of cold holding on to the oncoming spring. Bilbo leans his face into his palm, fingers tapping against his temple as he watches the clock. The thing had always run a little fast.Bofur would have been able to fix it. He was always going on about tinkering and fixing little things, his hands always busy whittling little designs into whatever piece of wood he picked up while telling a bawdy joke or bursting into a song. Killi would join in of course and soon the lot of them would be vying for who could be loudest and the most absurdly out of tune. Softly, under it all, as if hoping he wouldn\u2019t be noticed, Thorin would sing quietly along, his voice steady and low and drifting sure to wherever Bilbo happened to be in the midst of the chaos.\nBilbo sits in the silence of his house, his refuge of peace, and realizes that this is the first time he\u2019s felt lonely while in his own home.\n\n\u00a0\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\u201cAre all hobbits like you?\u201d Thorin asks one day as they ride their ponies next to each other, frowning in curious confusion at Bilbo.\u201cWhat? Like what? What am I like?\u201d He\u2019s not really sure if he wants to hear the answer, even moreso when Thorin tenses and looks away quickly, shrugging awkwardly.\u201cThrowing themselves at orcs and bantering with mad goblins in the middle of a fight while missing their handkerchief.\u201d Thorin finally says, mouth twitching up at the corners, and Bilbo bursts out laughing at the very idea.\u201cOh heavens no!\u201d He chuckles, still giggling when Thorin stares at him and he has to wipe the tears from his eyes as he imagines the other hobbits seeing him now. \u201cOh not a bit. I\u2019m really one of the worst hobbits I\u2019ve ever met. I mean, I haven\u2019t even tried fixing the buttons on my vest!\u201d That sends him into another fit of laughter as Thorin stares at him like he\u2019s gone mad.\u201cWhat do you mean, one of the worst hobbits? You\u2019ve done nothing wrong. If anything you\u2019ve proven your value to the company many times over.\u201d Thorin frowns, looking displeased with Bilbo\u2019s title of \u2018Worst Hobbit Ever\u2019 and Bilbo starts up laughing all over again.\u201cThorin, Hobbits don\u2019t do grand deeds or anything dangerous! If you go to Bree you\u2019re considered an unusual and foolhardy adventurer! I was given enough glances for always reading about adventures, I can\u2019t imagine the scandal that erupted after I ran by yelling about going on adventures with that contract in my hand and a pack on my back. A Baggins running off with a bunch of dwarves and a wizard! They\u2019ll be whispering furiously and in shock about it for months I expect.\u201dThorin doesn\u2019t look the least bit pacified, if anything his frown deepens. \u201cThey should honor you. You have left your home and saved my life, saved us from many perils and that is not something that should be shoved aside under shame.\u201dBilbo waves a hand and chuckles again. \u201cStop flattering me Thorin, you know I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not flattery!\u201d Thorin snaps, and he looks away with a scowl at Bilbo\u2019s surprised look and mutters furiously at the back of his pony\u2019s head. \u201cYou\u2019ve done much, more than I would have ever given you credit for. And now I\u2019m convinced that you\u2019re better than any halfling who would think to look down on you simply because you\u2019re greater than anything they could hope to be. The fact that you should go back to a place that would put you down for bravery and-\u201d He stops and grits his teeth, twisting the reins in his hands and scowling darkly, jaw set and eyes blazing in Bilbo\u2019s defense.There\u2019s that fluttering again. The damned warmth that drops over him that anyone, least of all Thorin, could ever see him as all of that. \u201cThorin,\u201d He says gently, \u201cit\u2019s really all right. Thank you. I don\u2019t...well I don\u2019t think any hobbit has ever been praised by any dwarf. I\u2019m not worried about what they may think of me, I\u2019m glad to have come along, and your words mean far more than any of their whispering.\u201d\u201cYou should never have to tolerate their whisperings.\u201d Thorin snarls, then spurs his pony on, trotting to the front of the line and leaving a very puzzled and giddy Bilbo behind him.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe loneliness doesn\u2019t leave.He loves every arch and warm wooden beam of his home, but the quiet of it presses around him and the chattering of the hobbits grates on him. At every sidelong glance he wants to yell \u2018I bantered with a dragon and walked out alive! What did you do last year?\u2019 and bites his tongue on it. There\u2019s laughter and merry songs outside his window, sunlight filtering through the trees and the growing of green things all around his house. And he feels like it's another world outside his window.He cooks and remembers Bombur suggesting what spices to use as him and Bofur bickered in good nature over the proper way to stew rabbits, snatching the ladle back and forth from each other until Thorin yelled that he\u2019d set it all on the fire and they could eat the burnt crisps of it if they didn\u2019t hurry up.He remembers teaching Ori to knit, getting the yarn and sticks from some traders and taking the young dwarf through the loops and knots, wearing the lumpy gloves with a warm pride weeks later. Ori took to it with all the focused fervor of any dwarf, soon weaving dwarvish patterns and sharp, geometric blocks into a series of scarves for all of them.Gloin would always go on about his family, showing Bilbo the pictures he\u2019d convinced the Elvin prince to give back to him and his gruff voice filled with a warm pride as he talked about his wife and \u2018wee lad\u2019 Gimli.Thorin would sit by him always by the fire, and now Bilbo remembers the looks, the gentle brushes of a hand on his back. No matter who sat where, it always ended with Thorin by him eventually, quiet and comfortable and a warm presence by his side. A curled smile as Bilbo went through the sword drills, laughing eventually at the prattling when he accepted that Bilbo really wouldn\u2019t shut up when nervous. \u2018You should never have to tolerate their whispers\u2019 Thorin had spat, enraged at the idea of Bilbo going back to the Shire as a shame.There were long, open stares, full of something that Bilbo is now starting to understand, and he could laugh at himself when he realizes how long he\u2019s been seeing those odd, searching and longing looks. There were warm hands holding his in a tight grip, blue eyes full of more than Bilbo could take and promises of a home, of a place to belong. -----------------------------------------\u201cSo I\u2019m just enjoying my dinner, I even remember what it was! A trout! A bloody trout with tubers and a lemon! And then this lout,\u201d he gestures at Dwalin, who booms out laughing at Bilbo\u2019s flapping, \u201cbarges in all \u2018Dwalin at your service, where\u2019s the food?\u2019\u201d\u201cAye and a good meal it was!\u201d Dwalin shouts over the ruckus, and laughs louder when Bilbo throws a bread roll at him. \u201cSo I\u2019m already all shook up, because there is a dwarf, in my home eating my FOOD.\u201d Killi yells something incomprehensible at that and Bilbo flaps a hand at him to shut him up, \u201cMy food, thank you! And there goes the door again! Soon enough I\u2019m infested and you lot,\u201d the dwarves cheer as if they\u2019ve been grandly complimented, \u201cShut up! You lot! You damned lot of buffoons, then somehow ate me out of house and home in one night and start going on about dragons and fire and incineration melting the bones off my skin!\u201d\u201cAnd wondering why yer dishcloths had a lot of useless holes in them!\u201d Bofur shouts, cackling and ducking the stick that Bilbo lobs at his head.\u201cI told you! That was a doily, and I\u2019m sure it still has the stupid grease stains on it from your daft fingers!\u201dThe dwarves continue laughing and sharing the night\u2019s meal between each other, shouting praise and yelling insults as Bilbo throws his hands up at the lot of them, hardly remembering how truly furious he was that night that seemed so long ago.It takes him a few moments, in the pandemonium, and shouting and laughter, to notice that Thorin is quiet and frowning into the fire. Bilbo feels the laugh dying in his throat and watches with a puzzled furrow in his brow when Thorin pushes himself away from the group and wanders off for a brood session. \u201cOh now what\u2026\u201d Bilbo mutters, extricating himself from the rowdy throng and making his way to where Thorin is stiff backed and staring out with his chin jutted out against the night. \u201cThorin? You alright?\u201dThorins fingers tap against the heavy padding of his shirtsleeve, frowning intently. \u201cYou truly did not know we were coming?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Is that all he\u2019s worked up about? Bilbo sometimes wonders if Thorin just finds something to brood about, if it\u2019s been too long since his last sulk. \u201cWell no, but-\u201d\u201cGandalf told us you were with us.\u201d Thorin says quickly, voice a furious mutter that has Bilbo\u2019s eyebrows going up.\u201cWell...no. Gandalf had talked to me earlier that day but I\u2019d told him to have off. He said he was looking for someone to join on an adventure and I\u2019d been pretty quick to send him on his way.\u201d He chuckles to himself at remembering how well that turned out. \u201cNext thing I know there were dwarves swarming my house and Gandalf muttering something about a mark on the door.\u201d\u201cHe said you were willing.\u201d Thorin grits. \u201cI\u2019d wondered what you were so worked up about and thought it was you trying to barter a better bargain from us. Or that you had been a fool who\u2019d agreed to something just for the idea of the grandeur and gold without any actual idea what we were for.\u201d\u201cThorin it doesn\u2019t really matter now-\u201d\u201cI dragged you out here, and you did not even know what was going on when we had met!\u201d Thorin snaps, and it hits Bilbo how deeply upset the dwarf is about all this. \u201cGandalf meant well, it ended up alri-\u201d\u201cThe wizard,\u201d Thorin snarls, \u201chas his own agenda. I already did not trust him. And I did not trust you thinking you two were in on something together. And now I trust him even less. He\u2019s a schemer and I do not like that he pulled you unwillingly into a quest that was not his to assign.\u201dBilbo goes quiet, feels something cold in his chest and swallows down a blooming disappointment. \u201cDo you\u2026.wish I hadn\u2019t come then?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Thorin huffs, shifting uncomfortably. \u201cYou\u2019ve proven yourself of value many times over, and I\u2019d want no one else in my company. That does not change the fact that you were pulled in against your will by a scheming wizard who doesn\u2019t show his true plans. Does it not trouble you, that you were turned into a pawn in this play of his that we still do not know the purpose of? That you-\u201d\u201cOh would you stop with that \u2018against your will\u2019!\u201d Bilbo sighs, and narrows his eyes when Thorin looks at him sharply. \u201cNo, shut up. I signed that contract didn\u2019t I? I may have not known what you all were doing in my house, but I read it all, I heard your story. I signed my own name, of my own volition, to that stupid bit of paper! And it was the most foolish decision I\u2019ve made in my life and I don\u2019t regret it one bit. So stop using me as your latest excuse to beat yourself up, Thorin Oakenshield! Because I\u2019m glad I got dragged out by you wild lot and glad I had some scheming wizard to pull me out of my books and into the world!\u201dThorin blinks at him. \u201c...I do not beat myself up.\u201d He says.\u201cMister Oakenshield I\u2019m quite sure that you can\u2019t go for more than three days time without finding something to skulk off and brood about.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Thorin says distantly, blinking still.\u201cYes you do. Now come on, it\u2019s damned cold over here and not all of us are wearing ten different layers of cloaks.\u201d Bilbo, feeling giddy on the excitement and joy of the night, actually dares to hook his hand in Thorin\u2019s elbow and drag the dazed looking dwarf back to the main group.It\u2019s not until almost a year later, that he recalls Thorin\u2019s eyes fixed on him, wide and wondering for the rest of the night, and the significant glances sent around the campfire as he pulled the surly dwarf king back to the group.\n\n\u00a0\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------Gods does he miss it.He misses the noise, the rabble, the nights spent laughing around the fire and feeling life all around him. He misses the banter and the shouting and the feeling that there was no one in the world but the fourteen of them. Bilbo goes through the motions of life in his hole. He makes his tea, cooks, gardens, sits in his armchair and sketches down memories. He pulls further and further away from the other hobbits, feeling the polite conversation and cheerful distractions grating on his last nerve. He starts watching the sky for black wings.There\u2019s a mad part of him that half hopes a raven will swoop in with dark news, with a letter of alarm that will pull him from this apathy of peace and quiet. He had never had company, not since his parents passed. He\u2019d never really felt himself relax around others, let himself laugh loud and long or tell his own jokes. And he doesn\u2019t know how he thought he could really go back to a life of nothing but himself after all the color and life of the dwarves filling a hole he hadn\u2019t known was in his heart. He misses cooking with Bofur and going over new stitches with Oin. Misses the drunken jokes and the laughter.He misses the quiet moments, where it wasn\u2019t just him now, but Thorin as well. Sitting and filling a space next to him in his moments of peace like it had been made for him. Misses being able to sit with his pipe and feel a comfortable silence as Thorin cleaned his blades or simply sat and watched the fire by him. He misses the rush of feeling all that focus on him, of Thorin\u2019s sure confidence in him, in seeing the surprised look when he managed to make the brooding dwarf burst into laughter at some deadpanned comment of Bilbo\u2019s.Bilbo goes through his routine, his comfort, and finds himself wishing he had Thorin there to talk to. To pour tea for and talk over translations with, to share the quiet moments where they could enjoy just their company and the quiet stories passed back and forth between them.\n He remembers the long looks, the glances between the other dwarves, the way Thorin would look at him like he was some confusing wonder that was beyond comprehension. Like everything that Bilbo was was just...something incredible.Bilbo realizes that he had become Bilbo Baggins out there, found himself in the amazed eyes of Thorin Oakenshield, and now he couldn\u2019t force himself back into the timid mold of Mister Baggins of Bag End.He\u2019s sitting on the edge of his bed, mithril shirt like flowing silver in his hands. It\u2019s been kept in the bottom drawer, out of site but constantly on Bilbo\u2019s mind. The token that everyone but him had been expecting. That Thorin said was rushed by the sickness, but still true as the heart behind it.The metal is warm in his hands, and he runs the pad of his thumb along the ornate decorations along the collar of it.\u201cI\u2019ve been a right fool, haven\u2019t I?\u201d He says quietly to himself.The house doesn\u2019t answer him, and Bilbo looks up at the empty, quiet rooms, the silence and oppressing loneliness that stopped being a refuge when he ran out the door so long ago. The smile comes slowly to his lips, and his hands curl the mithril against his palms. And he makes his decision.\n\nHe wonders how his life got to the point where, even when given food and hot drinks and clean clothes, he can\u2019t quite relax. The men of Laketown have welcomed them and after days of freezing water, shivering whispers in a hut, and midnight break-ins, the whole company has been taken to the Master\u2019s home to stay in the guest halls. They\u2019re bathed, fed, given a comfortable area to sit, and Bilbo can\u2019t bring himself to relax and laugh and lounge about with the others, which is ridiculous because this is probably the first bit of luck they\u2019ve managed in this entire daft mess of a quest.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nHe supposes it\u2019s hard to relax, when you\u2019re stuck wondering if you\u2019re going to be made into a well toasted meal the next day. If you\u2019re a reasonable, non-dwarfy sort, that is.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nSo he clutches his tankard of hot mulled wine, frowns at the opulence of the Master\u2019s halls in comparison to the ragged feel of the rest of the town, and sits on a small couch by the window, looking out at the mountain.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThere\u2019s a soft touch to his back, a quick press of a hand, and it\u2019s only because Bilbo\u2019s gotten so used to Thorin\u2019s quiet way of saying hello that he doesn\u2019t jump out of his skin. The first few times he did, after he was suddenly deemed a real part of the company and learned first-hand how tactile the dwarves are. He\u2019d already adjusted to the others tendency to grab and nudge and slap in constantly friendly greetings or joking prods, but for a while Bilbo had thought Thorin was simply separated from all that. It wasn\u2019t until after the crushing hug on that rocky peak that he realized he simply hadn\u2019t been accepted into the fold in Thorin\u2019s eyes, as it were. After that there was a deluge of touches; a pat here, a tap on the shoulder, a quick hand pressed to his arm in acknowledgement as Thorin rushes by. Little touches that constantly kept him aware of the dwarf\u2019s presence. \u00a0\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBy now the palm between his shoulders is hardly out of the ordinary, it\u2019s something of a comfort. It\u2019s concrete, warm, steadying, and so normal that it settles a bit of the tension growing in him. Bilbo glances up with a little smile and a nod, and that\u2019s their usual greetings now. A touch, a smile, and they go on.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cI need to thank you,\u201d Thorin says quietly, hand sliding smoothly down Bilbo\u2019s back before pulling away as the dwarf sits by him on his little couch by the window, \u201cfor speaking on my behalf earlier.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cWhat? With the-? Oh that was nothing.\u201d Bilbo loosely waves the thanks away with a scoff. \u201cOf course I\u2019m going to vouch for your honor. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be Thorin without it, it\u2019s like second nature for you.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThorin\u2019s smile is small and easy, eyes warm and unusually relaxed. \u201cI wish it were so easy as you make it sound. I\u2019m glad to know you think so highly of me.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cYou take honor to a nearly pigheaded level, if I\u2019m to be honest.\u201d Bilbo says with a laugh, and Thorin sighs and rolls his eyes, though his smile grows a bit.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cAh, and there it is. I knew it would only be so long before our Burglar would find a way to spin praises to insults.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cI mean the praise and the insult, thank you. You threw yourself over a cliff to pull me up once and you didn\u2019t even like me!\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThorin\u2019s smile shifts into an uncomfortable grimace, arms crossing awkwardly over his chest. \u201cI didn\u2019t dislike you, exactly.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cOh come off it.\u201d Bilbo snorts, well remembering all the disapproving glares, annoyed huffs, and passing scowls whenever he happened to make any movement around Thorin.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t trust you. But moreso, I didn\u2019t think you capable of the tasks that would come. As Dwalin had said, you were of the gentle folk, yet you had pledged services to me. I did not much like the idea of having what I thought was your sure, violent death on my hands.\u201d Thorin says in a rush, fingers tapping nervously against his arm.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cSo I...made you feel guilty because I was going to die?\u201d Bilbo\u2019s face scrunches up as he muddles over that. He really had just thought Thorin had outright not liked him in general, but then it begins making sense. Thorin was constantly scanning over his company, mentally tallying each of them after any skirmish, being the first to jump up between a possible threat and his dwarves, yelling orders to keep everyone alive and intact. Thorin took a pledge of allegiance as a mutual trust of service and protection.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cI did say I had been wrong on that count.\u201d Thorin mutters, sinking down a little.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Bilbo tilts his head, then nods like he\u2019s just made some important decision. \u201cWell you really just proved my point then. You thought even some little halfling idiot who shouldn\u2019t have come out of his hole was your duty to protect, just because he was fool enough to sign a contract.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re no fool, Master Baggins.\u201d Thoin says gently, smile starting to show itself again.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bilbo grins, \u201cI\u2019m not. And since I\u2019m no fool, Thorin, I can say without any foolishness, that you\u2019re worth staking my own honor on. You deserve every bit of it.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThorin looks like he\u2019s considering arguing on it, then he sighs and dips his head, eyes flicking down before he turns his attention to the mountain. The small smile doesn\u2019t move, but it turns to something more poignant and longing, as he gazes on the mist shrouded peak. Bilbo looks out with him. They\u2019ve been watching that single mountain for months now, it hardly feels real that he\u2019ll be finally standing on it tomorrow.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nHe can\u2019t imagine what Thorin must be feeling, him and Balin, the two that remember the daunting and mysterious mountain as home. Bilbo can\u2019t imagine how any of the dwarves feel really, even he feels a tightening in his chest when he looks at it, and when one comes down to it, he doesn\u2019t even have a reason to care.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cHow does it feel then?\u201d He asks quietly, \u201cBeing this close to it all?\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThorin watches the mountain for a few more silent moments, and doesn\u2019t take his eyes off it when he slowly answers. \u201cIt feels like I may actually be able to do this. That after everything that came against me, I\u2019ll be able to do this for my people. There is still much to do before I can say it\u2019s done, but we came this far within the right time, and everyone is alive. I\u2026\u201d He pauses, works his jaw and winces a little, as if he doesn\u2019t really mean to let this out, \u201cam loathe to admit it, but I wasn\u2019t sure we would get this far. I would have fought to get here to my last breath, but I couldn\u2019t see myself accomplishing this much. Not many did.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThat...was far more than Bilbo was expecting, and he distracts himself by pretending to blow on his cooling wine as his mind works through all of that. He never had thought of Thorin as being one do doubt anything, much less his own abilities. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d he starts, hoping he doesn\u2019t go and screw it all up, \u201cI don\u2019t think any of them took into account how determined you can get. You\u2019re one of the most stubborn folk I\u2019ve met, I think if you decide you\u2019re going to do something, it\u2019s going to happen. Even if all you have with you are twelve dwarves and a very lost halfling.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThorin glances away from the mountain with a smile that grows when he looks out over his company, then back to the mountain. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want anyone else behind me in this. Or beside me.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBilbo nods, and sips on his wine. \u201cSo, what is the plan then? After we get the door open? If the dragon is gone then easy enough, but if it isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cThe arkenstone.\u201d Thorin says quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to get the arkenstone. And it\u2019s why we needed a burglar. If the dragon is in there, then it is sleeping, and we only need one stone. Something that small should be easy enough to take, and with that I would be recognized as the King of Erebor, and could summon the armies of all my kin to take the beast down once and for all.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cAnd you seriously think I can do that? Steal a gem from a dragon.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThorin glances over, eyebrows up like it\u2019s obvious. \u201cYou were able to go undetected in an Elvish kingdom for nearly a month. If you can\u2019t steal from a dragon, I very much doubt anyone can.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cSo...that\u2019s it then? Open the door, sneak in, get the arkenstone, kill the dragon with a lot of angry dwarves?\u201d \u00a0Bilbo pushes on, wanting to get the attention off of him as quick as he can. It was almost easier when Thorin didn't expect anything of him, and he didn't have to worry about praise that he highly doubted he could live up to. Though Thorin puts the plan out like it's so simple, so straightforward.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s much to do afterwards.\u201d Thorin admits. \u201cErebor is in ruins, my people would need to be brought back, as well as any kin who would wish to come. Most importantly, I would need to bring my kin here and establish my line as King. There\u2019s much to be done, before I can say this is finished.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBilbo sips his wine again, even if it\u2019s cold now, and thinks. He only signed on officially for as long as it took him to finish his job as the burglar. Technically, he could turn right around and leave as soon as he did what he was brought on for. But it feels...wrong. \u201cWell\u2026.\u201d He begins, then in a moment of daring, reaches out to put a hand on Thorin\u2019s shoulder. The dwarves really must be rubbing off on him, he thinks, and even Thorin shoots a look of surprise at the casual contact. \u201cWell, I signed on to this, and I\u2019ll see it to the end. I may have just been taken on as a burglar, but I want to see it finished.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThorin turns his full attention away from the mountain, and looks Bilbo over like he\u2019s not quite sure he believes the hobbit is there. The wide grin that Bilbo has become familiar with grows slowly over his face, and he grasps Bilbo\u2019s shoulder in one hand, right over the collar of Bilbo\u2019s now ragged good shirt.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nHe leans forward, and Bilbo tenses up at the sudden breach of space, then freezes entirely when Thorin\u2019s forehead presses against his own. It\u2019s only the fact that he\u2019s seen this gesture before, shared between Thorin and his nephews, or with Balin on a few occasions, that keeps Bilbo from yanking back in alarm. Even so he\u2019s horribly aware of how close this is; of Thorin\u2019s large hand on his shoulder, the gentle brush of air against his cheek as Thorin exhales, Thorin\u2019s black hair falling around them like a curtain, shutting the world out and trapping him within this bubble of just the two of them.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cWhen this is finished, when it\u2019s all done.\u201d Thorin says softly, barely over a whisper. \u201cWe will have much to discuss, you and I.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBilbo swallows, unable to find his voice to ask what the blazes Thorin means. He\u2019s still trying to fight past the lump in his throat when Thorin sits back again, gives a final smile and friendly squeeze of Bilbo\u2019s shoulder, like they just shared some deep secret together, and stands up to rejoin his company.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n  \n\nThe problem with deciding to leave, is that this time Bilbo can\u2019t exactly just grab a pack and go flying out the door. Technically he could, if he really wanted to. But he knows that this isn\u2019t some last minute run after something wild and unknown, something that he\u2019ll be coming back from. The entire idea is to not come back, and there's a lot to consider there.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s definitely going to remember his handkerchief, for one thing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis first issue is getting to Erebor in the first place. Last time he happened to have a wizard and a band of dwarves with him, and Bilbo may be an irregular and foolish hobbit, but he\u2019s hardly a stupid one. A few drills with a sword don\u2019t do good when you\u2019re driving a loaded cart through mountains and forests loaded with orcs, goblins, trolls, and heavens knows what else. Adventure is all well and good, but he would rather this trip be a little more calm than his last trek to the mountain.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat problem ends up solved easily enough by a few trips to Bree. Merchant caravans of Dwarves are common enough, and he hangs around the Prancing Pony until he hears mention of travel to Dale for trade, work, and the chance to see the legendary reclaimed Erebor. After that it\u2019s a matter of a few coins, fewer questions, and a space guaranteed for him in their caravan within a month\u2019s time. He knows he strikes a curious figure, a gentlemanly hobbit with a cloak and an elvish blade on his hip (he\u2019d made sure to wear Sting, not just because he feels bare without it now, but because it doesn\u2019t hurt to let Dwarves know one is armed just for the little bit of respect it brings) asking to join up in a very un-hobbit like journey halfway across Middle Earth. But the merchants only eye him curiously, accept his coin and his offer to help with cooking, and ask no questions. And if they send a flurry of small hand signals at each other when they think he's not looking, then that's their business.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s something he rather likes about Dwarves. Don\u2019t pry into their affairs, and they won\u2019t pry into yours. Unless they have decided you\u2019re friend-kin, then every shred of privacy goes out the door and you\u2019re fair game.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo figures he\u2019ll likely have enough of prying, nosy dwarves in his future, and a few months of quiet and suspicious dwarves doesn\u2019t sound all that bad.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo he\u2019s left with a month to close everything up and prepare to leave the Shire behind him. The first thing he takes care of there is his will, and that\u2019s only a matter of stopping by the notary and having it officially written and signed that after he is gone for a year, Bag End and all that is left in it will go to his cousin Drogo Baggins, his young wife Primula, and any of their line after that. Technically, without his change to the will the estate would have gone to the next in line, but that would leave it all to the Sackville-Baggins family.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019d rather go on in peace with knowing that I\u2019ve thwarted Camellia for the rest of her life. Don\u2019t write that down by the way. Actually can you? Can we make that officially part of the will? Camellia and Logo can have my blessings to stare at Bag End all they want while their far removed cousin and his Brandybuck wife live long and happy there. Drogo\u2019s the only other Baggins I can stand, and I honestly can\u2019t stomach the idea of any of the rest of this absurd family living there. That should do nicely.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe notary is a professional, and his face is blank and nothing but business as he writes everything down, ignoring Bilbo\u2019s unseemly and petty giggling. He leaves in a final note that the passing of Bag End not be announced until the year is up, just so he can know that the Sackville-Baggins brood would spend that long waiting to snatch it up only to see it go to Drogo. It\u2019s the best going away present he can give himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNone of it feels real, exactly. It\u2019s like some game, preparing for some grand step that hasn\u2019t really sunk in as an actual event. It isn\u2019t until he buys a large cart and two sturdy ponies (Gerda and Tilda, he decides), and begins packing up that it finally begins to dawn at him that he\u2019s leaving this place. For good, most likely.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis books take up three trunks alone, and he hires some workers to dismantle his writing desk to make it easier to take with him. It had been commissioned for him by his father, long ago, when he first started jotting down stories and ideas or notes on languages, and he still will pause sometimes and run his fingers over where he had crudely carved his initials into the leg as a small boy, or where he had spilled ink and stained the wooden top. Besides that there\u2019s his mother\u2019s jewelry box, all her crochet and knitwork, a trunk of his clothes, bedding, his parents portraits, and a few other small bits and pieces with more sentiment than any real use.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis armchair is the last to go out, carefully wrapped against the elements and secured tightly into the cart alongside two barrels of Longbottom Leaf before everything is covered and strapped in. When Bilbo walks back into his hole, he has to stop for a moment to look at the space it had occupied by the fire.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s two days now, before he\u2019s due to meet up with the merchants outside of Bree, and Bilbo wanders the curving rooms and halls of his home.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe loved this place, still loves it. There\u2019s marks on one doorway where his mother had jotted down his height, the couch where he had sat on his father\u2019s knee and heard stories of his great great grandfather Balbo Baggins, who built this home and began their proud family line. Wherever he goes, a part of his heart will always stay here, in this place that will in some way always be home. It\u2019s not a hard thing to come to terms with, and it\u2019s not that he regrets his choice, but he\u2019ll miss it all the same.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf things had gone different, he could have probably stayed here in his peace and isolation, content with his books and pipe and garden. But now he talks out loud to himself and feels a pang when no one answers. He\u2019ll have some dry remark and wish he had Bofur\u2019s crooked grin answering him with a joke. There\u2019s his fireplace and warmth but there isn\u2019t a broad hand on his back, a silent greeting of contact that\u2019s so comfortable that he doesn\u2019t even think on it. Not until it\u2019s not there anymore.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis place is home, will always be a home, but his heart isn\u2019t here, and hasn\u2019t been for quite some time. And Bilbo\u2019s starting to think that maybe one can have more than one home in their life, and it\u2019s alright to outgrow one so happiness can root in another.\n\n\u00a0\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn literally any other circumstance, he probably would have loved the elvish kingdom in Mirkwood. The deep, underground city, built within the roots of the forest, has a wild beauty that mirrors Rivendell while being completely different. Rivendell\u2019s delicate houses and open air balconies had a precise and refined elegance that ornamented the waterfalls they were built over. Each archway and each ornate balcony was a work of art there, with flowing, intersecting lines and complex patterns that must have taken years to plan out.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nMirkwood is wild and entirely organic, each home and pathway looks like it was grown from the roots around it, and Bilbo wonders if the whole thing was made that way, instead of built. There are carvings here and there, a few more practical sections of simple structures. But everything here speaks of a beauty that could go feral at any moment. And the elves here match their home, fair haired and bright eyed, quicker than the dark, languid and draping Rivendell elves. The wood elves leap from path to path, move like wild animals on the prowl, laugh sharp, joke easy, and bristle with small knives or bows and arrows wherever they go.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nIt\u2019s the danger that currently strikes Bilbo more than the beauty, as he clings to the walls and flits from nook to nook within the city. The elves seem constantly on the alert, eyes scanning everywhere they go even as they laugh and grab drinks or walk arm in arm together. After two days of trying to find some weakness in their guard, Bilbo is so drained that he nearly falls off the path a few times, and it\u2019s only the fact that he happened to be in an empty corridor that saves him from being caught at the unseemly squawk of alarm he makes.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nHe needs to sleep, he needs to find somewhere to rest, but he can\u2019t get himself to relax anywhere in this place. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s hard to find safe areas, Bilbo has already managed to crawl into several abandoned little crannies or dips within the wood. But every time he lays down he can hear his heart pounding, each trickle of water, the creaks and groans of living wood, and wonders about his companions deep, deep down in the dungeons.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nAfter a whole day spent just going from resting spot to resting spot he finally gives up and very carefully makes his way down. It\u2019s a slow journey past guards and patrols, including the red haired woman who seems to make it a habit to march sharply through every few hours, eyes focused and assessing as she checks her charges. All of the elves are frightening in their own way, but Bilbo finds her the most alarming, second only to the terrifyingly calm and intense king.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nEventually he makes it to the dwarves cells, and, like a magnet, he\u2019s drawn to Thorin\u2019s.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nIt\u2019s late, gods know HOW late, but he knows it\u2019s late by the quiet that\u2019s fallen over the city and the soft snoring echoing through the dungeon. Every dwarf fell asleep hours ago, except Thorin, who sits on the ground with is back to the wall, practically plastered up to the bars of his cell with his hands gripping each other tight over his bent knees.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBilbo takes in the lank hair, left to hang wildly everywhere instead of pushed back as it usually is, the deep shadows around Thorin\u2019s darting blue eyes, and has the feeling that the dwarf has slept about as much as he has. The worry-wart has probably just finished pacing and brooding menacingly at any elf that happened to pass by, and Bilbo almost feels sorry for the guards.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nAlmost, he thinks, looking at the strained lines around Thorin\u2019s eyes, but not quite.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nHe carefully settles himself down against the wall in Thorin\u2019s nook, finding a nice little alcove area in front of the bars. It\u2019s become a fascination, watching people with the ring on, and Thorin is a completely different level of fascinating. Bilbo can see the way each breath is carefully measured, exhaled in a burst, and drawn slowly back in. Thorin\u2019s eyes keep flitting from outside, to each wall of his cell, then back out to take a silent tally of each cell he can see from his own, forehead constantly furrowed. He really is pressed to the bars, the metal of them biting into his upper arm and his leg.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nA while ago, he had talked about Erebor and his family, his childhood, and his voice had taken an oddly strained note when he mentioned how he hated the cramped room he would be locked up in whenever he was caught wandering out too far. Bilbo remembers that now, and remembers the wild, enraged panic in Thorin's voice as the fumes of mirkwood seeped in and all he would talk about were the trees pressing in around them and the lack of air. Bilbo decides that no, actually, he doesn\u2019t feel sorry for any elves that come under that glare at all.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThe pad of his thumb runs slowly over the ring, warm and feeling alive with some buzzing energy against his finger. He watches Thorin, and seriously considers taking it off. What he would accomplish by that, he isn't sure. Some comfort maybe? Telling Thorin that he\u2019s working on something, he\u2019ll get them all out of there and get Thorin out of the cramped space. But he needs to stay secret, needs to make sure there isn\u2019t any hint that the elves should go looking for an intruder. He knows Thorin wouldn\u2019t make a scene, but he doesn\u2019t imagine even he could keep fully quiet if Bilbo materialized out of no where, and the hobbit can only imagine the ensuing pandemonium as soon as the others got word that he was there.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nHis hand falls away from the ring, and he sighs slowly and leans back against the wall. He scoots in as close as he dares, not really knowing what he\u2019s trying to do, but wanting to reach out and take Thorin\u2019s hand, to stop the nervous tapping and the darting, trapped panic in his eyes. Instead Bilbo just sits nearby, feeling useless as he looks in on the caged king.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nAfter a few minutes Thorin inhales slowly, then steadily begins to calm. His frown never leaves, but he leans his head back on the wall and lets his eyes shut with a long sigh. Bilbo curls up where he is and watches the dwarf slowly drift off, finally relaxing enough to sleep sitting uncomfortably up against the bars of his prison.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u2018I\u2019m working on it.\u2019 Bilbo thinks, feeling his own eyes grow heavy. \u2018I\u2019m here. I\u2019ll get us out. Don\u2019t lose hope and don\u2019t give up on me just yet. I\u2019ll get you out.\u2019\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nIt\u2019s a mantra that he repeats every night before his vision fades, returning to the same spot each night to sleep in front of Thorin\u2019s cell.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe leaves when the first bit of light is creeping into the sky, but before the sun rises, when the night begins fading into a pale and clear dawn. The acorn is in a pouch on his belt, and he picks one last harvest of mid-summer vegetables from his garden. There\u2019s a basket of tomatoes, squashes, and sweet pepper that he packs away to snack on in his cart. \u00a0That should at least give him a few days of something fresh before it\u2019s all tough, bland road food.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis time there\u2019s no one to avoid goodbyes with, though a few farmers are already out, watching him with solemn and concerned disapproval as he puts on his hat, lights his pipe, and lightly twitches the reigns to get moving.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wears a plain and sturdy shirt and deep red vest, a brown jacket folded in the seat next to him. The mithril sits under it all, warming against his skin and hidden away under fine hobbit made cloth. If it weren\u2019t for Sting resting at his hip, he would look like any other trader heading to Bree with his pipe and broad hat in the early morning.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs he approaches the edges of Hobbiton, he pauses for one last look back at Bag End, caught in the early morning light and perfectly tranquil. Gandalf\u2019s words from over two years ago come back to him, and he smiles and makes one small change before he clicks the ponies on.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHome is behind, home is ahead.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPerhaps it is best if that stone remains lost.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBalin gives him a pointed look, and Bilbo swallows, gives the smallest nod, and steps back. He has to take a few breaths, feeling the air swim around him because he doesn\u2019t want to lie to Thorin, it\u2019s been hard enough as it is so far. But he can\u2019t just give in and give Thorin what he wants and make everything worse.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nIt gets just a bit too much, and he sits heavily on a dust coated box, rubbing his hands over his face and closing his eyes. This is one of the first times he\u2019s had a real chance to breathe away from Thorin\u2019s shadow. He scrubs his hands over his face again and has no idea what to do. He can\u2019t just cart the arkenstone around forever, tucked away in an inner pocket of his coat.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cYou alright, laddie?\u201d Balin asks, coming up by him, voice gentle with worry. \u201cY\u2019er looking faint.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m- I mean yes. Yeah. I\u2019m. I\u2019m just.\u201d Bilbo looks around, and does his regular check for the gold glint and hulking shadow of Thorin that seems to lurk around every corner to snap at him to follow. And every time he does the check he feels a heavy lead weight sink into his guts. He shouldn't be checking to make sure Thorin isn't nearby, not when he used to want Thorin around. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just-\u201d He laughs nervously, trying to make it sound lighter than he feels, \u201cI think...I think Thorin may suspect something\u2026\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBalins bushy brows lower, and he crouches down by Bilbo. \u201cLad...I think if he suspected you, you\u2019d know.\u201d He nods his head to give another significant look, and Bilbo recalls Thorin growls of \u2018I will have my vengeance\u2019 and has to agree with him.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe? It\u2019s just-\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cJust?\u201d Balin prompts, leaning in.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t-I don\u2019t know. I think this is the longest time I\u2019ve been able to go without him around? I don\u2019t know what it is. He won\u2019t let me out of his sight, Balin!\" Bilbo stands up then, running his hands back through his hair and starting to pace in a tight circle. \"He won\u2019t let me down to search with the others for the stone, and I thought it was because I...failed...the first time.\u201d He clears his throat and Balin nods rapidly as he goes on. \u201cBut he isn\u2019t...he says I don\u2019t need to keep looking because I\u2019ve done my part. And then there was the bit at the throne...I\u2019m just. I\u2019m used to him always being around and I guess it\u2019s not new but this feels\u2026\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nHe swallows, unable to voice the tense fear that Thorin inspires now, and how completely at odds it is from the usual comfort he had come to associate with his friend. How the enveloping safety and steadiness has been completely replaced by this tense apprehension, like he\u2019s trapped prey whenever Thorin growls a command to follow him to some new part of the mountain. Thorin doesn\u2019t even pay much attention to him, for all he\u2019s dragged around. It\u2019s like Bilbo is only really noticed if he talks, or if Thorin realizes that he isn\u2019t nearby.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBalin grimaces, eyes looking away almost guiltily as he sets his mouth in a thin line. \u201cLad\u2026\u201d He stops and runs a hand down over his beard, and Bilbo stops his pacing and looks up, noting how unusually tense the old dwarf is. \u201cLad you\u2019ve done your part. You were hired to sneak into the mountain past the dragon, and you\u2019ve done that. Your part of the contract, as far as I can see, and I wrote that contract mind you, is fulfilled.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Bilbo asks slowly.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cI mean,\u201d Balin says, and he stops fidgeting, looking Bilbo firmly in the eye. \u201cI mean, you should consider heading out, Master Baggins.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cWhat? No! No no, Balin-\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cBilbo.\u201d Balin interrupts, \u201cThe winter will set in hard soon enough, and you\u2019ve no more duty holding you here. I\u2019d hate to see you go but-\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere!\u201d Bilbo snaps. \u201cNo, Balin! This isn\u2019t done here! I told Thorin,\u201d He has to stop and swallow, remembering Thorin as he was in Laketown, calm and relaxed and smiling out at the mountain. \u201cI told him...I told him I\u2019d see it finished. I promised him I would stay until it was all done. And it isn\u2019t yet, not while it\u2019s like...it's all wrong. I can\u2019t just leave now while he\u2019s like this. He\u2019s sick and I can\u2019t leave. Not while Thorin-\u201d He has to stop himself before he says \u2018needs me.\u2019\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nHe can\u2019t be thinking like that. There\u2019s nothing he can do, really. He can\u2019t fight sickness and he carries the one item that he had hoped could help hidden away in his coat. If anything all he could do is make Thorin worse, but he can\u2019t make himself leave. Thorin isn\u2019t right, Thorin needs help and Bilbo could never forgive himself if he left Thorin to this sickness and madness and ruin.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBalin sighs, and shakes his head with an odd, sad smile. \u201cRight. Of course not. Would you promise me something then lad? If Thorin-...if anything happens-\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Bilbo asks, and Balin looks at him with this unplacable sadness. \u201cBalin? What do you mean? What would Thorin-\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u201cBilbo!\u201d \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThorin\u2019s shout is a shock to his nerves, making every one of Bilbo\u2019s muscles clench up. He takes a bracing, deep inhale, and forces himself to relax bit by bit against the winding tightness that begins coiling up when he turns to smile curiously at the broad shadow storming into the room.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cOh! Hello Thorin, you need something?\u201d He asks, smile on and voice light, placating and calm. Thorin pauses, the thunderous scowl blinking away for a brief moment as he looks between Bilbo and Balin.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He asks, frowning suspiciously at the two of them. Bilbo wants to throw something, wants to scream that this is BALIN for goodness sake! What would either of them be doing against Thorin?\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nInstead, he shrugs, face scrunching up in innocent confusion. \u201cTalking, we just were having a chat. Don\u2019t get much chance for it these days.\u201d Balin smiles amiably and nods besides him.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThorin\u2019s full scowl returns, though it\u2019s slightly less dark, which is the best they generally hope for these days. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time,\u201d he growls, \u201cfor chit chatting. Balin, get back with the others. Bilbo, with me.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBalin nods and walks out, back to the endless piles of gold and the very, very lost arkenstone. Bilbo smiles and keeps his step light despite the hammering in his chest as he falls in line behind Thorin.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want me down there with them? I could-\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do anymore.\u201d Thorin interrupts. \u201cIt\u2019s time they do their part.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Bilbo agrees quickly, jaw clenched and fists tight at his sides as he follows Thorin down to look over the hills and hills of gold.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s being stared at again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLuckily for Bilbo, after coming home to the Shire decked out with a dwarvish shield and a chest of treasure, is used to being stared at. And the dwarves are far less prone to gossiping.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell, he thinks they are. There is an awful lot of quiet conversation in Khuzdul going on all around him, and while he\u2019s starting to listen for the patterns he hasn\u2019t quite got the sharp, stacatto language figured out yet. It\u2019s awkward, but he continues on in his cart near the back of the caravan, keeping a book out to make it clear that he isn\u2019t interested in conversation. It\u2019s still an odd contrast to his last experience with dwarves. Maybe it\u2019s different, when you\u2019re not officially part of a company? But he feels like an odd outcast.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJust a few months. And it is rather peaceful. He can sit around one of the fires, smile politely, chat about the roads that day with one of the other families, and go back to his cart without any trouble at all.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s nice while it lasts.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cInteresting sword, for a halfling to carry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo is well practiced at dissembling at this point, and only looks up in vague, innocent interest at the young dwarf sitting on the other side of the fire, acting like he\u2019s been asked about the weather and that there aren\u2019t suddenly about ten sets of eyes watching him with interest. It\u2019s nearly two weeks into the trip, and he thought they had all gotten used to him. But the dwarf, who must be around Ori's age, watches him curiously as Bilbo glances down at Sting like he just now noticed it there.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHm? What? Is it? I thought it was a bit small.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s elvish.\u201d Another dwarf, older and decorated with ornate, beaded braids, says gruffly. Bilbo is not surprised at all at the hint of disgust in his voice.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh! Yes. I found it in ah, in a cave. Thought it was a-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo you actually know how to use it?\u201d The young dwarf asks, no insult in his voice. He\u2019s honestly curious, watching Bilbo like he\u2019s some odd little animal that can do tricks. Bilbo can\u2019t really be insulted. He\u2019s back in his finer Shire clothes, well bathed, and calmly smoking a pipe, so he hardly looks the part of a warrior. He still doesn\u2019t really see himself as one, to be honest.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh a bit.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve done some drills? Nothing really special. It\u2019s mainly a deterrent, you know what I mean? It also helps to distract enemies because they wonder what the bloody hell a halfling is doing with a sword, and then I can have off while they muddle it over.\u201d He smiles, and a couple of the dwarves chuckle, while a few others narrow their eyes at him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHalfling\u2019s don\u2019t carry swords.\u201d Another dwarf states, gruff and final.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo glances down at Sting and scrunches up his eyebrows in concern, working his pipe between his teeth. \u201cWell this is awkward then. I wish someone had told me that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEspecially not elvish swords.\u201d Says the braided dwarf, and Bilbo looks up again and tenses when he notices the number of eyes on him has about doubled. He clears his throat and busies himself by puffing on his pipe, shrugging and fighting the urge to start reaching for the sword that has caught so much interest.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell. You know. I just like carrying it. It\u2019s-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cA halfling. With an elvish blade. Heading off to Erebor.\u201d The young dwarf says, the words slow and drawn out, like the pieces of a puzzle. His eyes slowly start to widen as the description seems to sink in and strike at something.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh hell.\u201d Bilbo mutters. Then winces at himself. He really picked up some dreadful language hanging around with the Company.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a few heartbeats of tense quiet as everyone watches him, then the braided dwarf makes an odd, excited shout and points at him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAkd\u00e2muthrab! You\u2019re the Burglar!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat? The-\u201d Bilbo leans back, eyebrows shooting up in shock. \u201cThe what? What did you call me? I have never-! How could-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe Burglar in the company! The halfling that travelled with King Thorin to take back the mountain!\u201d He goes on, and the explosion of activity drowns out Bilbo\u2019s groan of pain.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a very good burglar.\u201d He mumbles, pipe tight between his teeth and feeling a bit trapped by the crowd around him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo you were then?\u201d The young dwarf looks like he\u2019s about to fall into the fire, he\u2019s sitting so far forward on the box he\u2019s taken as a seat. Bilbo sighs heavily, sends a silent goodbye to the peace and quiet of his journey, and shrugs.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh. Yes. Yeah I was in the Company. Bilbo Baggins, at your service.\u201d He admits, half mumbling it into his pipe as if he hopes no one will actually hear him. The excited flurry of Khuzdul around him proves that the effort was in vain.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid you really fight the dragon?\u201d The young dwarf asks, breathless and wide eyed. \u201cIn the mountain?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?! Did I-? No! No goodness no! Where did you-\u201d Honestly what WERE they all saying? He bet Bofur said that, the gossiping cad. \u201cNo I didn\u2019t fight it at all! I think I was the worst fighter of the lot of them. I just talked at it a bit.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou talked to the dragon?\u201d Braids asks, now leaning forward as much as the younger dwarf. \u201cYou lived. How did you manage it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt uh,\u201d Bilbo coughs and busies himself knocking his pipe out a bit before puffing it again. \u201cYou just...dragon\u2019s are easily flattered and very...polite...in their very dragonish way? You talk at them and they just...sort of talk back. It wasn\u2019t that impressive, I just babbled at the thing until I was able to get away.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo you really do know how to use that sword.\u201d Youngster says smugly, as if Bilbo had tried to lie earlier.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, Thorin taught me a bi-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe dwarves absolutely explode into excited shouts and exclamations of awe. Bilbo groans and rubs at his forehead. Gods there\u2019s a migraine coming on.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou knew him, then?\u201d One dwarf yells, practically vibrating out of his boots.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell I was in his company so I should hope so.\u201d Bilbo snaps. \u201cThere weren\u2019t that many of us-\u201d He's half tempted to say that their Hero King was the one who got them lost half of the time, but decides that it would be bad form to ruin Thorin's shining image when he's possibly on his way to marry him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he like? King Thorin?\u201d Youngster shouts over the din, and all like that they go silent, eagerly watching Bilbo as they hang on his imminent answer.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo looks around, takes a slow puff, and sighs, giving up on being able to get away from any of this. \u201cHe-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe has to stop again, watching the fire and trying to find an actual, easy way to finish the sentence. Thorin is\u2026.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIncredible, hopelessly brave and noble, honorable to a fault, one of the most caring people Bilbo has met, intense, determined, tad obsessive, a complete loss with directions, stubborn, good at battle strategy, bad at overall planning, complete moron when he sets his mind to it, can take years off your life with a glare or completely melt your insides with a smile that\u2019s all teeth and bright blue eyes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo is utterly hopeless, a complete loss. He clears his throat, feeling his face heat up a bit and hopes the firelight is too dim to really show how red he probably is. \u201cHe\u2019s...well he\u2019s beyond description...really. It was an adventure just being in his Company, and the greatest honor any halfling could ask for.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe dwarves all gather in closer, all breathless and eager.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWere you there in the battle? When he charged out of the mountain?\u201d Braids asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t with him then.\u201d Bilbo clears his throat, deciding it\u2019s probably best not to tell a bunch of idolizing dwarves about how he betrayed the trust of the great King Thorin Oakenshield. \u201cI was fighting in Dale, but I was able to see it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe dwarves press in more, and Bilbo gives in. He takes his pipe and leans forward, setting his elbows on his knees and looks out at the audience that\u2019s gathered around him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo, what was left of Dain\u2019s army was backed against the front of Erebor, surrounded and barely holding together. I was on the walls of Dale, and thought I was about to watch a slaughter, when from the top of the ramparts of Erebor, the war horn blew\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt goes on for hours, telling stories of his adventures with the legendary King Under the Mountain, and he manages to completely avoid the fact that he\u2019s heading back with plans to accept a wedding proposal.\n\n\u00a0\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe has absolutely no trouble with the fact that Thorin is attractive. Very attractive. Kingly and noble and seemingly having a sixth sense for when to look off when the light will hit him just so and the wind will ruffle his thick black hair.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nIt\u2019s annoying at first, and not because Thorin happens to be most definitely masculine. That was never much of a problem for Bilbo, who had always been a bit more interested in the people more than anything. An attractive person was just attractive. No, the issue with Thorin wasn\u2019t that he was an attractive male dwarf, but that he was an attractive ass. No one, in Bilbo\u2019s opinion, should be that surly and rude, and still manage to be devastatingly handsome while going about it.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nEventually it\u2019s something of a little internal joke to Bilbo. Thorin manages to be so attractive that it becomes funny. It\u2019ll be raining, they\u2019ll all look like half-drowned dogs, everything\u2019s splattered in mud as they start trying to find a way to make camp, and there would be Thorin. Thorin, with his hair curling in the damp and flung wildly about him, his face smudged with just enough mud to make him look rugged, and water dripping around his glaring blue eyes. And Bilbo would have to stop himself from bursting out laughing because really: Who looks like that? Who honestly bloody looks like that except Thorin bloody Oakenshield?\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nSo it goes on well enough like that for a while. Thorin glares at him and snaps at him to keep up, the sun breaks through the clouds behind him in just the right way to crown him in golden light, and Bilbo tries not to start giggling because no one actually looks like that. He manages to keep a straight face usually, and just mentally ticks off another point on his list of Reasons Thorin Oakenshield Isn\u2019t Actually Real.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThings take a bit of a wrong turn after the eagles drop them off.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cI have never been so wrong in my life!\u201d And Bilbo has gotten quite used to Thorin scowling and looking good with it, but he was entirely unprepared for Thorin smiling at him. Thorin\u2019s smile is flashing teeth and steely blue eyes suddenly sparkling with warmth and affection, fine lines that Bilbo had no idea existed crinkling at the corners. It\u2019s really unfair, Bilbo thinks, his stomach dropping in shock at that smile, because no one warned him! And it\u2019s doubly unfair, because Thorin has a gash across his nose, blood splattered on his face, and his cheek is swelling a bit and starting to bruise, and he still looks like that!\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nHe\u2019s still mentally reeling from Thorin\u2019s smile, and therefore doesn\u2019t have a chance to prepare himself for the extra shock of Thorin yanking him into a bone crushing embrace. Bilbo never had been one for casual contact, even with regularly attractive people, and nothing could have prepared him for the enveloping warmth.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nSeveral things strike him at once, in the first few seconds of that hug.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThe first one is that Thorin is very, very solid. It\u2019s like being held by a very warm wall. And that\u2019s the next thing, Thorin is incredibly warm. Bilbo\u2019s surrounded by a sturdy heat, holding him secure and tight against Thorin\u2019s front, thick arms around his back pressing him in and then Thorin somehow pulls him in more. Bilbo can feel Thorin\u2019s face pressed against his jaw and feel that black hair about his face as it\u2019s shoved into Thorin\u2019s shoulder. It\u2019s then that the smell hits him. There\u2019s smoke and fire and the tang of blood but under it there\u2019s leather and metal and spice. And there\u2019s absolutely nothing funny about this, he thinks, his stomach still down somewhere around his feet and his heart frantically trying to escape his ribs. It\u2019s terrifying and yet he feels the overwhelming urge to curl into that embrace and bury himself against Thorin\u2019s chest and make himself quite comfortable there.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u2018Oh dear...\u2019 he thinks, feeling the first signs of an odd bubbling in his chest as he hesitantly lifts his arms and returns the embrace. \u2018This is going to be a problem...\u2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hardly recognizes Dale.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo knows that with the return journey, the months in the shire, and the long haul back, it\u2019s been over a year since he last saw it, but he still can hardly believe the change that\u2019s taken place. The caravan trundles into the city, which he can honestly call a city now, and he stares around with wide eyes, trying to equate this hustle with the ruins he remembers. There are still crumbled buildings and sections of missing wall from the battle. There are still large sections that feel empty, not yet occupied by what\u2019s left of the humans of laketown. But every tumble of stones and every broken down tower is swarming with a mix of men and dwarves, all shouting and hammering and sawing and hauling away to rebuild.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe manages a few quick goodbyes to the dwarves who had listened most to his stories, fends a few headbutts off and graciously accepts the hugs and makes several promises to come by for dinner. Unlike with some of the Shire folk, he honestly looks forward to it this time. But work is to be done, wares to be sold, and he finds a space by the main road where he can pull his cart over and watch the work going on around him while he tries to get himself sorted.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo has absolutely no idea what he\u2019s going to do now. He had months on the road to plan it out, and never really getting something down. Would he settle in Dale for a bit first? Or just make his merry way on up to Erebor and stride in as casual as he could, oh yes how is everyone? Don\u2019t mind him he\u2019s just here to see if Thorin still has that whole marriage proposal offer on the table or if Bilbo should just quietly scurry back to Dale and pretend none of that happened.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t think Thorin would take something like that back. Or he hopes. Maybe. He had wondered often, if it was too late. If his sudden departure had soured what had grown between them and he\u2019d be returning to the awkward remains of friendship. But this was Thorin, who had spent years in Blue Mountains fixating on Erebor, who had stubbornly held on to the conviction that his little band could reclaim an entire kingdom from a dragon. This was the Thorin who chose to sit in a cell rather than put aside an old grudge against the Elf King. No, he can\u2019t really imagine Thorin letting anything go for more than a few decades.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEspecially now that Bilbo's had time to really think back on it, and remember how long ago he started seeing those soft smiles. He doesn\u2019t have much doubt that there may still be hope with Thorin, he\u2019s just still not sure how exactly he\u2019s going to bring it up without feeling incredibly awkward and foolish.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI had heard rumor, that the latest traders had a bit of an odd traveler with them.\u201d Says an amused voice by his cart, and Bilbo jumps a bit from where he was staring up at a group of dwarves carefully constructing a large arched bridge over the main road. He looks around, then grins at the rider who\u2019s come up by him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBard! Or King Bard, I hear is the official title now?\u201d Bard grimaces, and Bilbo grins wider. The man looks slightly more like a king now, wearing finer leather and clothes without a bit of holes in them, though it\u2019s still a simple outfit. The showiest part is the crossed black arrows over the back of his long coat, and the plain golden circlet on his head.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHate the title. Hate the ruckus that goes with it, but there\u2019s work to be done and someone might a well make sure it happens.\u201d Bard shrugs away any more discussion of his royalty, as if it were a dreadful, tedious thing, which Bilbo suspects he honestly thinks it is. \u201cWhat brings you all the way back to Dale, Master Baggins?\u201d Bard goes on, holding out his hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo takes it and can\u2019t stop smiling warmly as he gives a firm shake. He and Bard hadn\u2019t had much chance to talk in all the smuggling, hiding, chaos, and discussions of war, but he had liked him and hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d honestly missed the gruff bowman. \u201cOh just visiting, thought I\u2019d stop in and see how things have come along on this side of the Misty Mountains.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBard raises his eyebrows and leans back on his horse, looking over Bilbo\u2019s furniture loaded cart with an exaggerated slowness. \u201cDo you think you may have packed a little lightly for a visit?\u201d He asks, drolly casual.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHm? What?\u201d Bilbo spends a bit of time pulling his pipe out of his travel bag and shrugs, makes a few noises that aren\u2019t really words in response, and coughs as he gestures at the bustle around him with his pipe. \u201cThis uh, you\u2019ve done a lot of work here, haven\u2019t you? I barely recognized the place, it looks like you\u2019ve about finished rebuilding it already.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBard gives him a sidelong glance, mouth twitching at the corner as he eyes Bilbo\u2019s cart again, then shrugs and goes with it. \u201cKing Thorin has been...surprisingly generous.\u201d Bard's mouth thins a bit at the admission, and he grudgingly eyes the mountain. \u201cAfter the battle had been cleared away, and the last of the dead buried, he rode into Dale with three carts of the precious gold he had been so eager to cling onto. Many of the dwarves coming in from the Blue Mountains and Iron Hills have also come here to find work and rebuild both kingdoms. I admit the shift is odd, but I\u2019m not going to pry into any offers of assistance.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo sighs and looks down at his pipe, playing with it in his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not that surprising,\u201d he says quietly, \u201cnot if you really know Thorin.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBard shrugs. \u201cForgive me, Master Hobbit, I know he was your friend, but I have not been given much reason to give him my own friendship. I can give good will for what he has done for us, but I do not have to like him for the hardship he\u2019s brought on to me and mine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not-\u201d Bilbo stops and has to take a breath before his temper gets the better of him. He knows, logically, that Bard really doesn\u2019t have any reason to like Thorin. Even before the sickness, Thorin wasn\u2019t exactly gracious and warm, and Bard\u2019s worries had ended up well founded, though not for the reasons Bard thought. \u201cHe was sick.\u201d Bilbo sighs. \u201cHe\u2019s ambitious and rash, but until the sickness got ahold of him, he had always been one to keep his word.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d Bard says, considering Bilbo\u2019s words. \u201cHe did not come asking for pardon, simply stating that he would hold on to what vestiges of honor he had left. And he has done that much.\u201d The king of Dale shrugs again, looking unconcerned with it all. \u201cIn the end, I can say he held to his word, and I can work with him as one King to another, but I do not have to like him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo snorts, Bard always had an honesty that was refreshingly open. \u201cFair enough.\u201d He admits. \u201cI know as well as any that Thorin can be...difficult.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBard looks over, glances at the loaded cart again, then back at Bilbo. \u201cWhat really brings you to Dale?\u201d He asks. \u201cDo not get me wrong, I\u2019m happy to have you here, and you\u2019re welcome to wherever you\u2019d like to live within my city, but I had thought you were long gone to your Shire.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes. Well.\u201d Bilbo holds his hands up and smiles. \u201cThe Shire ended up a bit dull. I\u2019m still working out what exactly I\u2019m going to do here. It will really depend on a few ah...very...key points. And how they play out.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBard nods, and doesn\u2019t pry, which Bilbo is very grateful for, because he really has no idea what the bowman would think of him possibly going off to hitch up with the dwarf King he just admitted to not liking. It\u2019ll have to come up eventually, but right now Bilbo\u2019s not quite ready to admit what his little personal quest is about. Even the traders had only been told that he was wanting to settle in closer to where his friends were. Which isn\u2019t a lie anyway, so it was an easy enough story to stick with.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWill you be staying in Dale for the night, Master Baggins?\u201d Bard asks. \u201cMy home is always welcome, and this time I can offer slightly better accommodations, if you need them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo chuckles, remembering the strange trip up through the toilet and then the hours spent shivering in Bard\u2019s little shack over the water. \u201cNo, thank you but no. I may take you up on that later, and we are definitely due for a visit that doesn\u2019t have any imminent death or threat of capture muddying it up. But there\u2019s a few things that I- well- that I need to get done. And I\u2019m afraid if I don\u2019t just head over to that blasted mountain to do it, I\u2019ll end up hiding here for days working up the courage.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBards eyebrows come together, bewildered at Bilbo\u2019s hesitance. \u201cThere\u2019s no dragon in there anymore, if you may remember.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh yes, and I do thank you for that. But at least I knew exactly what the dragon was about, and what it\u2019s threat was. I\u2019m afraid I was a bit of an idiot and left the entire company with only a note and with no goodbyes. And dwarves can be...emotional.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s startled by Bard\u2019s bark of laughter, and looks over in surprise, realizing he never really heard the human laugh at anything. \u201cOh I heard about that a little!\u201d Bard chuckles, shaking his head. \u201cA few of your little band stormed in asking if their fool Burglar had run off to my halls, but by then you were already off with the wizard. They made quite a scene. It was one with the odd hat, the tall bald one, and the King\u2019s young kinsmen, his nephews, if I heard correct.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBofur, Dwalin, Fili and Kili.\u201d Also known as all the loudest of the whole lot, and least likely to care about decorum and respect. Bilbo winces, imagining the spectacle they must have made. \u201cYes...sorry about that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Bard claps him on the back and grins. \u201cI imagine my embarrassment is about to be repaid. I don\u2019t envy you at all my friend.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh I wouldn\u2019t either.\u201d Bilbo sighs. \u201cThey\u2019ll either hug the life out of me, punch me, or both. Anyway, wish me luck, I hope I\u2019m in one piece next time I see you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBard laughs again and gives him a sarcastic little salute as Bilbo snaps his reins and gets his cart back on the road. Before he leaves the city, he sees a few wagons and dwarf families from his caravan, and gives a final cheerful wave goodbye as he passes them. Several look up and shout farewells, waving excitedly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s too far ahead to see who the owner of the voice that booms out behind him is.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAYE LADDIE!\u201d It shouts, clear and gleeful over the bustle of the city. \u201cGO GET YER KING!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo freezes, head whipping around to stare in panic as several of the merchant dwarves burst into loud, guffawing laughter. A good number of them join in with their own shouts of encouragement varying from calls of luck to a few more...colorful wishes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh no. Nooo. No no no!\u201d Bilbo squeaks, hunching down and quickly turning his attention back to the road, face turning beet red as the cheers and catcalls send him on his way to Erebor.\n\n\u00a0\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n\u201cAlright, I missed something.\u201d Bilbo comes up besides where Bofur is twiddling away at a new bit of wood by the fire for the night. \u201cI go get my bowl and he\u2019s gone and sulked off.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cOh that,\u201d Bofur looks up at where Thorin has separated himself to stare meaningfully off into the distance. \u201cYou want the short version or the long version?\u201d He asks with his usual crooked grin, scooching aside to give Bilbo a place to sit.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go with the short version.\u201d Bilbo plops down, stretching his legs out in front of him, \u201cI expect the long one is riddled with tragic backstory all over, and drama puts me off my appetite.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cOh I highly doubt that.\u201d Bofur snickers and cleanly slices away a bit of bark on the wood, fingers moving quick and sure as he turns it this way and that. \u201cKili said something about wondering where Gandalf has run off to this time, Thorin says we don\u2019t need him, Fili said he\u2019s been a bit useful to have \u2018round, specially with that troll incident not to mention him healing Thorin after the eagles, and GETTING us the eagles. Thorin is offended that his nephews have turned so cruelly and devastatingly against him.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBilbo wrinkles his nose up, trying to figure out how all that has led to another dramatic brooding session. \u201cBut...Gandalf is useful. I quite like having a wizard around, myself.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBofur puts his hands up, shrugging as he places his whittling aside and takes the bowl of gruel for the night from Bilbo. \u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 he\u2019s makin\u2019 sense! And don\u2019t go saying that around him, he may go into a sulk for days if he gets it in his head that his nephews AND his burglar have ganged up on him and sided with, oh Mahal what did he call him? The \u2018pointy hatted meddler.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cOh this is ridiculous.\u201d Bilbo snorts, glaring at their dramatic, brooding, idiot leader. \u201cHe\u2019s just got his knickers in a twist because Gandalf doesn\u2019t take orders from him.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBofur shrugs. \u201cAgain, wouldn\u2019t be saying that in front of him.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cWell of course he\u2019s decided to have a fit in the middle of dinner.\u201d Bilbo sighs, pushing himself up with a groan as his legs inform him that they don\u2019t appreciate being put to use again.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think he should be sent to bed without supper?\u201d Bofur grins, and Bilbo snickers.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cSupper was hours ago. And as much as I\u2019d love to tell him off like the child he is, our grand leader probably needs to not end up passing out from lack of food at some point tomorrow.\u201d Bofur mutters something about hobbits and their food, which Bilbo ignores as he slops some of the nights mess from the large pot over the fire into another bowl.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\u201cYou really gonna go over there? Y\u2019know there\u2019s no talkin\u2019 with him when he gets like that. Dehersu zirin kall.\u201d Bofur says, nodding over at Thorin.\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cWell someone has to try or he\u2019ll stay up all night and be unbearable tomorrow. And derhuwhatsit yourself, thank you. I\u2019m at least going to make a go at it.\u201d Food in hand, he makes his way over to Thorin.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cHate to interrupt whatever you\u2019re up to over here.\u201d He starts, and feels just a little pleased when Thorin jumps a bit before glaring at him. As far as stealing things, he\u2019s a rubbish burglar, but at least he has a pretty good handle on the sneaking bits. \u201cThought you might like some food. Or what we pass off as food.\u201d He holds one of the bowls out to Thorin, who bristles and glares at it like it\u2019s personally offensive.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d He says, making it sound like an insult. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cOh come on.\u201d Bilbo sighs, nudging Thorin on the arm with the bowl as he shoves it forward more. \u201cMade it special myself. Just the way you like it, with extra lumpy bits of mystery in it. I worked extra hard on this batch, had to make up some completely new spices for it. By make up, I mean that they\u2019re imaginary.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThorin looks up at the bowl to give Bilbo the now familiar look. The one that says he\u2019s not sure what to really think of the hobbit, and is undecided if his confusion should give way to anger or not. The quizzical look, bordering on outright suspicion, doesn\u2019t leave as he takes the bowl from Bilbo\u2019s hands.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cThere you go!\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThe confusion gives way to a glare and Thorin yanks the bowl back, narrowing his eyes at Bilbo for a few more seconds before he takes the most grudging bite of the food, which utterly ruins whatever look he\u2019s trying for as he stares meaningfully off at the horizon.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cHow is it then? You know how I pride myself on my gruel cooking.\u201d Bilbo prods, and manage to stop himself from cheering himself when Thorin\u2019s mouth twitches up a little bit at the corner. The dwarf glances at him from the corner of his eye, the smile solidifying slightly at Bilbo\u2019s wide eyed look of false earnest hope.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s dreadful.\u201d Bilbo agrees, nodding rapidly. \u201cBut I imagine with a bit of any other ingredients, it could be salvageable.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cIt only needs to keep us fed.\u201d Thorin points out, though he\u2019s a lot less growly now.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cThorin.\u201d Bilbo says very firmly. \u201cRemind me to actually cook you something after all of this.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThorin eyes him again, as if he\u2019s been threatened instead of offered a meal. \u201cAlright.\" He says, sounding like he's weighing his words very carefully \"I\u2019ll hold you too that, Burglar.\u201d\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf he hadn\u2019t already seen just thirteen dwarves build a sturdy barricade wall overnight, complete with built in stairs, ramparts, and peek-holes, using just random blocks of ruin and rubble, he wouldn\u2019t have actually believe what he was seeing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe makeshift wall is gone, and the bridge leading into Erebor is remade with smooth stone and hulking statues of the armed, crouched dwarves. Where there had been a gaping maw into the mountain, there was now a solid door of wood and iron, engraved with runes and great carvings of ravens clutching giant stones in their claws. The ramparts have been rebuilt over the gateway, fully manned by guards, and to the side is a giant block of stone that\u2019s swarming with dwarves strapped in place and carefully chiselling away a new statue to replace the one Thorin had ordered destroyed to block the entrance.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo hops down from his cart to lead the ponies over the bridge, heart hammering as he stares at the massive doors before him. He feels far too exposed on the bridge, even with the bustle of dwarves (he hadn\u2019t quite realized how many there must have been, waiting in the Blue Mountains) around him, all laden with hammers and axes and equipment as they come and go through a smaller door off to the side of the main gate.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMahitdin!\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo jumps, having forgotten for a second about the guards up over the gateway. He stops and grips at the ponies reins.\n\n  \n\n\u201cWhat business do y\u2019have with Erebor?\u201d The voice is low and rough, having no patience for whatever Bilbo may say. Oh he knows that too well. Bilbo tilts his hat back and cranes his neck to squint up and sure enough, there\u2019s a shining bald head set on broad shoulders that are just visible from where Bilbo is.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d He muses, loud enough to carry to the top of the wall, \u201cjust a bit of burglary, really.\u201d Dwalin leans hard over the top of the ramparts to stare down, and Bilbo can just hear the muttered curse as he grins up at the dwarf.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBilbo!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHullo!\u201d Bilbo waves, and Dwalin curses again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYah little SHIT!\u201d He hollers over the wall, loud enough now that a few dwarves are stopping to stare. \u201cI\u2019m gonna wring your damned little neck! Open the gate! Open it right now! I\u2019m gonna kill him!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh dear.\u201d Bilbo says to himself, wincing as Dwalin disappears behind the ramparts, echoes of various threats to Bilbo\u2019s well being drifting up from behind the wall. He watches with raised eyebrows as something large and metal clanks, and one of the doors begins to swing open. Dwalin\u2019s shouting can be heard the entire time, and he emerges as an image of rage from the gates of Erebor.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cA note! Nothing but a fuckin note! Ag zasasmaki rathkh-hund!\u201d He snarls, fists balled at his sides as he stalks towards the smiling hobbit. Dwarves dive out of his way and he looks like a legendary figure of war, dressed in iron armor emblazoned with a raven in flight over the chest. Bilbo notes the blues and deep reds, and also notes that there isn\u2019t a hint of gold on the plate armor, for all it\u2019s decorated with the complex geometric squares dwarves are so fond of.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell I was always terrible at goodbyes\u2026\u201d Bilbo starts, and any other excuses are crushed out of him as he\u2019s swept up into a hug that may be designed to break his back. Dwalin sets him down and grabs Bilbo\u2019s head hard between both hands, and Bilbo sends up a frantic prayer that he isn\u2019t about to get knocked out by a friendly dwarvish headbutt, but Dwalin settles for just shaking him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou-!\u201d Dwalin says,grinning wide even as he rattled Bilbo\u2019s brains about in his skull. \u201cAh you\u2019re a sight for sore eyes Master Baggins! Maybe we\u2019ll finally have some peace \u2018round here!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUh, peace?\u201d Bilbo manages, voice jumping up an octave when the shaking stops and is replaced by an arm slung around his head and yanking him into an unbreakable headlock. \u201cDwalin! Dwalin get off me! I\u2019m sorry alright! Ow-!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAY! BROTHER!\u201d Dwalin shouts, ignoring the little hobbit fists pounding away at his armored shoulder. \u201cCome look at what\u2019s crawled up to our doorstep!\u201d Bilbo manages to land a hit on a joint in Dwalin\u2019s armor, and only gets a loud laugh and a giant hand rubbing violently over his head for his efforts.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBrother,\u201d He can just hear Balin\u2019s voice approaching from the direction of the doors, sounding like this is a conversation they have had many times before. \u201cI\u2019ve told you, y\u2019can\u2019t refer to the men like that, it\u2019s bad for diploma-oh bless my beard! Is that Master Baggins you have there?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBalin!\u201d Bilbo shouts, renewing his efforts to squirm his way out of the elbow locked around his neck. \u201cHelp!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLittle bugger just came riding up to our door!\u201d Dwalin snorts, giving Bilbo another little shake. \u201cHappy as you please and as if nothing was the matter at all.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy goodness.\u201d Balin just says, and Bilbo can hear the fond smile, but no mention of him actually being let go. He can just see a bit of white beard when he looks up through his hair, and one of the dwarf\u2019s hands reaching out to get the attention of a nearby guard. \u201cCould you take Master Baggin\u2019s cart and find a place for it? And send word to the Eastern slope, I believe the King is still out there, and I expect he\u2019ll want to hear about our new guest\u2019s arrival.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo swallows a bit at the mention of Thorin, half hoping that the King will take a bit getting to them so he can have a little more time to think of something. At the moment, however, he\u2019s more concerned with the fact that he\u2019s still doubled over and locked in place. He\u2019s aware of someone taking the reins to his ponies from his flailing hands, and can hear the clop of hooves going off towards what he assumes are the stables.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBalin!\u201d Bilbo yelps, hands flailing wildly to gesture at his current position, as if the older dwarf hasn\u2019t already noticed it. Dwalin laughs again and he gets another hard ruffle over his hair. \u201cDwalin you let me go you confounded- I should turn around! Should turn right around, this is the worst idea I\u2019ve ever had! Right after signing that stupid contract and leaving Bag End and getting dragged along just to be abused and-and- bring me my cart back! Bring it back right now I\u2019m going to-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh right, right yes.\u201d Balin chuckles. \u201cAh, brother? I believe you can release our burglar now, I think he\u2019s quite gotten your point.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDwalin lets go, without any warning, of course, and Bilbo nearly goes right to the ground. He manages to keep his footing with just an undignified squawk and a good amount of flailing, and punches Dwalin in the arm as soon as he stands. A choice he instantly regrets, and leaves him biting back a string of curses as he shakes his fist out. Dwalin just laughs again, and slaps him on the back hard enough to nearly send him to the ground again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDwarves.\u201d Bilbo lets every bit of aggravated disdain he\u2019s ever felt ooze into the word as he makes a pointed show of straightening out his jacket.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBalin chuckles warmly and pats Bilbo on the back, and it\u2019s hard to hold back the smile that comes over his face around the old dwarf.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou could have sent word, Master Baggins,\u201d he points out, starting to lead Bilbo into the mountain. \u201cNot that you aren\u2019t welcome by any means, even after a departure that would be considered rude by any standards, much less a hobbit's.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo winces, but accepts that he\u2019s going to be hearing about that for a while, and can\u2019t exactly blame any of them. \u201cWell it\u2019s not like I can exactly send a raven, can I? And I doubt the Hobbiton messenger pigeons would make it past the Misty Mountains. Besides, you all burst into my hole uninvited, I thought it was high time I return the favor.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBalin laughs, and the three walk into the mountain, now free of ruins and lit with the golden light Bilbo had heard Thorin whispering about. Last time he was here, the place was a tomb, filled with charred and desiccated bodies shriveled in their armor, stones and statues toppled to the grounds. And Bilbo doubts that the mountain has reached the full majesty that it had once had, but it\u2019s still an amazing transformation into something that could be considered an actual home, instead of a shamble of ruin and memory.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin works quickly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, Bilbo. I\u2019m sure the rest of the company will agree, once word\u2019s gotten to them.\u201d Balin says, and Dwalin claps Bilbo on the back again, this time without enough force to knock him down. Bilbo looks up into the hollow mountain, and can see glimmers of lights from braziers and torches, hear the echo of voices and shouts of orders, the ringing of hammers and the hum of saws.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2018You\u2019ll understand, when you see it. You could stand on the ground level and look up and only see neverending staircases and archways, doors and lights shining like stars within the stone, stretching forever upwards.\u2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo walks along the stone halls, gazes past the grand statues and ornate carvings, up into the lights glimmering within the depths, and thinks he is starting to understand. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be back.\u201d He says.\n\n\u00a0\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe was prepared for drunk dwarves. Bilbo saw the laketown men hauling in barrels of wine and ale, platters of food in celebration of the deal struck with Thorin. And he really thought he was prepared, he had seen dwarves in celebration in an unfortunately up close and personal setting.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nHe was not prepared for Thorin.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cThorin! Get off me! You\u2019re too heavy you lunk!\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThorin, who is well on his way through another tankard of ale (Bilbo had given up on keeping count long ago) just laughs and, as a result, sways and leans more heavily on Bilbo. Bilbo, who had mistakenly thought that their grand leader would have had the wisdom to not partake quite so much in the merriment. He was wrong.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nDwarves.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThorin\u2019s been as loud and excitable as the rest of them, booming laughter ringing over everyone else as he went throughout his company, exchanging hugs, friendly slaps on the back, and the occasional headbutt. At one point him and Dwalin had started yelling in good nature about something and had nearly destroyed some perfectly good furniture in the process. Bilbo made the mistake of intervening, and Thorin responded by throwing an arm over Bilbo\u2019s shoulders, yanking him firmly against his side, and proceeding to drag the hobbit around for the rest of the night and, occasionally, use him as a crutch.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cThorin!\u201d Bilbo snaps, smacking the arm hooked around him for what has to be the tenth time that night. They\u2019re supposed to be facing a dragon tomorrow! And everyone\u2019s practically falling over themselves like a bunch of idiots, with this idiot leading the way. \u201cThorin let go!\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cBilbo!\u201d Thorin grins, voice too loud and sounding like he just remembered Bilbo was there and it\u2019s the best surprise ever. \u201cBilbo you\u2019ve been amazing!\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBilbo sighs. \u201cYes, thank you Thorin.\u201d Thorin has been going to everyone and informing all of them how amazing, incredible, noble, and perfectly loyal they are. It was charming the first five times.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cI really-\u201d Thorin sways again and Bilbo\u2019s legs nearly give way under him. The dwarf catches himself and yanks them both back upright so suddenly that Bilbo yelps as he\u2019s nearly lifted a little off the ground. \u201cI really thought you were going to die within a week!\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cYes, well, so did I.\u201d Bilbo huffs, and lightly smacks the large arm around him again. \u201cThorin, come on! We really can\u2019t be-\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t!\u201d Thorin goes on, flinging out his free arm and sloshing ale all over the place. \u201cAnd it is because of you we\u2019ve made it this far.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cThorin, I really-\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cThis quest owes our success to you, Master Baggins.\u201d Thorin says firmly, and it would be touching if he weren\u2019t slurring the praise.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cThank you Thorin, but if we\u2019re going to actually finish this in time, we need to get your drunken, idiot arse set and taken care of for the night.\u201d He can\u2019t imagine them trying to hike up the mountain tomorrow, not if Thorin is still recovering from this lunacy. For what has to be the hundredth time, Bilbo wonders how dwarves manage to function at all. Obviously someone here is going to have to be in charge of some intelligent, responsible decisions.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cI am set!\u201d Thorin declares, \u201cI\u2019m King Under the Mountain!\u201d He bellows the title out, and all the dwarves stop to cry cheers and shout in Khuzdul, raising their tankards. Thorin cheers back and Bilbo nearly gets ale spilled all over him. The only thing that saves him from a migraine is when they all stop to down their drinks.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Bilbo mutters, and grabs onto the bit of Thorin\u2019s sleeve in front of his face. \u201cRight then. That\u2019s all well and good but you\u2019ll be King under the bloody tables if something isn\u2019t done.\u201d He tugs on the sleeve and manages to start steering Thorin, who\u2019s being surprisingly cooperative, towards the stairs that lead to the rooms they all have been given. There\u2019s a bit of difficulty once they actually reach the steps where Thorin forgets how to work his fool legs and nearly sends both of them tumbling down. Bilbo manages to grab the railing and grits his teeth at the explosion of cheers that their stumble brings.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cAy Bilbo!\u201d Bofur yells, \u201cgive him hell!\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBilbo rolls his eyes and waves his hand, and the headache starts returning when Thorin bursts into laughter right by his ear. Everyone else seems to think that Bofur is the most hilarious thing ever, and the cheering follows Bilbo and Thorin all the way up the steps.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d we get up here?\u201d Thorin asks, cheerfully curious as he looks around the room Bilbo\u2019s managed to steer him into.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cWalking. Thorin. You walked. Or, more accurately, I walked and dragged. You stumbled, fell and staggered.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cAre you taking me to bed, Master Hobbit?\u201d Thorin cackles at his own joke, swaying wildly again and Bilbo aims him at the bed, where he lets the idiot fall into a pile. Thorin flops back and keeps on laughing while Bilbo rubs at his own abused shoulders, seriously wondering if one got dislocated during his stint as a support beam for inebriated kings.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m putting you TO bed, you moron.\u201d Thorin lifts a hand and waves it in Bilbo\u2019s general direction, slurring something in Khuzdul which Bilbo loudly ignores as he goes to the side table. \u201cOh thank goodness there\u2019s some water.\u201d He mutters, picking up the full pitcher and pouring it into a mug.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cWe are on a lake, Bilbo.\u201d Thorin says with a slow grin. \u201cThere is plenty of water.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Bilbo snorts, getting a hand behind Thorin\u2019s shoulder and easing him up to sit on the edge of the bed. \u201cI can not believe you let yourself go like this you colossal idiot. No-shut up, just shut up. I don\u2019t want to hear it. And stop grinning like that, you\u2019re a disgrace. Drink this.\u201d He shoves the mug into Thorins hand and the dwarf takes it without a protest, holding it with both palms and grinning widely at Bilbo.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re incredible.\u201d He declares.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cThank you Thorin, drink that.\u201d Thorin surprisingly obeys, chugging back the water with all the enthusiasm he had shown the ale earlier, then raises his eyebrows and tilts his mug so Bilbo can see that it\u2019s empty.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cWill that suffice?\u201d He asks.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cOh yes well done, you\u2019re still able to drink water.\u201d He moves in to take the mug back, and as soon as his hands are free Thorin grabs Bilbo\u2019s face between them.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cI\u201d He announces solomnly, \u201cam going to marry you.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very nice Thorin.\u201d Bilbo sighs, dislodging himself from Thorin\u2019s grip and shoving lightly on his chest. \u201cI bet you say that to all the nice halflings.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThorin flumps back at the lightest shove Bilbo gives him, arms splayed wide at the bed. \u201cI don\u2019t like the other halflings.\u201d He snorts.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cShut up and go to sleep, you\u2019re going to be a disaster tomorrow.\u201d Bilbo moves over to the side table to put the mug back. And he really should have learned his lesson from downstairs, when it came to coming within grabbing range of drunk dwarves. He only has a second to realize his mistake when a large hand fists itself into his shirt and yanks him onto the bed.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cThorin! Thorin let me go!\u201d Bilbo\u2019s voice nearly squeaks as he gets pulled in, smacking at one of Thorin\u2019s wide shoulders but it\u2019s far too late. Thorin mumbles something in Khuzdul and flings a thick arm over Bilbo, pinning the hobbit firmly and, just like that, starts to snore.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cYou are joking!\u201d Bilbo snaps, kicking in futile and yelping in indignant fury when Thorin mumbles in his sleep and tightens his arms around his unwilling captive. \u201cLet go of me! You stupid, pig-headed, stubborn, pea-brained, thick skulled-\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBilbo continues hissing insults, squirming and flailing around until he can finally free himself of his prison. Thorin mutters something else as soon as Bilbo manages to escape, and flails his arm for a bit until his hand lands on of of the pillows, which he instantly curls himself around.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBilbo sighs, and shakes his head, glad no one can see the small smile that he can\u2019t quite fight down as he tugs a blanket up over the loudly snoring legendary Thorin Oakenshield. \u201cTomorrow is going to be a mess, you idiot.\u201d Bilbo says fondly.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nHours later, long after he\u2019s meandered his way over to another room and passed out on his own bed, he\u2019s woken unpleasantly by a loud banging on his door.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cWake up, Master Baggins!\u201d Thorin\u2019s voice booms through, perfectly clear and strong and brimming with excitement. \u201cWe leave within a half hour!\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBilbo highly doubts that, and stumbles over to the door, blinking rapidly as he flings it open into the sunlight. He squints his eyes when he spots Thorin, blinks again, then nearly flings his hands up in complete disgusted surrender. Because Thorin\u2019s going from door to door, fully washed, dressed, bright eyed, and completely awake as if he wasn\u2019t running into tables and loudly proposing just the night before.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cDwarves.\u201d Bilbo snarls, yanking his door the rest of the way open and marching out of his room.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou bastard!\u201d Bofur yells, and Bilbo is swept into the fifth back crushing hug of the day. He\u2019s wondering if he\u2019s going to end up incapacitated for life as a direct result of enraged dwarf affection. \u201cYou slimy little bastard!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBalin\u2019s pulled him into one of the smaller rooms with a long table that\u2019s already been heaped with platters. Heaven knows when these arrangements were made, or how word got out so fast, but one by one the company arrives in, and each time Bilbo prays that this won\u2019t be the one that finally breaks him. Goblins, trolls, orcs and dragons have nothing on dwarves.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know, I know!\u201d Bilbo says, voice cracking in surprise when Bifur comes up and slams a hand into his back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat were you thinkin\u2019!\u201d Bofur goes on, stepping back but holding Bilbo firmly by the shoulders. \u201cTea time is at four?!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell it is!\u201d Bilbo says weakly, and is given another firm slap on his back for his trouble. \u201cI said I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry he says!\u201d Bofur declares, giving Bilbo a last little shake before he goes and falls into a chair with the others at the table. \u201cSorry! Can yeh believe it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019re y\u2019here for then?\u201d Gloin stabs right to the point, as per usual.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWill you be staying?\u201d Ori asks quietly with a hopeful smile.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI do actually plan on, well yes. It will depend on how some- how some uh, things, play out. If not here then I\u2019ll be in Dale. The Shire is just...well you all got me too used to noise and you can\u2019t yell at the other Hobbits like I can yell at you.\u201d Bilbo grins and grabs a roll from the table, and feels lighter than he has in nearly a year. There\u2019s noise and grinning faces around him, shouts and debilitating back slapping and a brilliant lack of any true civility. There\u2019s no false smile, no forced polite little greetings, and Bilbo finally feels right in his skin again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHold on,\u201d He asks, looking over the faces and taking a little tally. Thorin is still absent, which he desperately steers his mind away from. He did leave the two of them in a rather awkward place, he can\u2019t really expect Thorin to sweep in and everything to automatically be alright. Though that\u2019d be nice. But none of the royal line is present. \u201cWhere are Fili and Kili?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOff to the Blue Mountains.\u201d Dwalin says gruffly. \u201cThey\u2019re going to try and convince the Lady Dis to return to Erebor with them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d Balin adds, mouth pulling into an odd mix of a grimace and a smile. \u201cI did hear rumor that Kili has been waylaid in the woods. Dreadful business.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo\u2019s eyebrows go up. \u201cOh. Oh! So did he...oh no how did that go?\u201d He asks, and the awkward glances around the table confirm his growing fear that whatever happened, it was not a pretty thing.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Oin starts carefully.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh don\u2019t dance around it.\u201d Dwalin snaps. \u201cKili ran off with his damned elf woman after Thorin nearly threw her out of the mountain!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh nooo. No no he didn\u2019t.\u201d Bilbo winces, knowing full well that yes, yes he most certainly did.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t quite throw her out.\u201d Balin amends. \u201cFili said she saved Kili\u2019s life a few...well at least two times. So she wasn\u2019t outright banished with a guard on her\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut there was still a good deal of yelling.\u201d Bofur says cheerfully.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh dear. I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t here for that.\u201d Bilbo can only imagine. An elf and a dwarf was bad enough, but one of the royal family and a mirkwood guard...oh it must have been a scene.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re here now!\u201d Bofur throws his arms out, and the company cheers instantly, boisterous and happy as ever.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes yes! I-\u201d He knows instantly. Though that\u2019s hardly a difficult thing with how the company falls silent, eyes all trained on the entryway a bit behind Bilbo\u2019s left shoulder.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe turns to follow their gaze, and there\u2019s Thorin. He\u2019s standing just in the doorway, arms crossed stiffly over his chest and Bilbo\u2019s struck, more than with any of the other dwarves, at how he doesn\u2019t look a bit different. They\u2019re all cleaner, of course, and all notably well dressed. Thorin is back in his layers of black and blues with steel mail and leather vambraces. It\u2019s almost a spot on for his outfit when they started the journey so long ago, except for the intricate designs of sharp squares and interlocking diamonds stitched in deep red on the sleeves and the crown of black metal and bright steel.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere isn\u2019t a bit of gold anywhere, and Bilbo notices that the crown, while similar, isn\u2019t the same that Thorin had worn when he\u2019d decked himself in golden armor and the ostentatious clothes of his grandfather.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThorin.\u201d And his heart is pounding, his head is buzzing, but he feels strangely grounded, like he\u2019s never been more solid. He can\u2019t help the little smile starting to pull the corners of his mouth.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMaster Baggins.\u201d Thorin says cautiously, head tilting in a guarded greeting. He doesn\u2019t move from the stone doorway, and his stiffly crossed arms don\u2019t relax in the slightest. \u201cI hope your journey went well.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The formality stops him a bit, and his heart stops the desperate pounding in favor of sinking down somewhere around his feet instead. \u201cI. Yeah. Yeah it was alright. A lot less exciting this time around, but I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d His mouth twitches up nervously to try and force the joke a bit. Thorin just blinks and gives another stiff little nod.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe silence is excruciating. Bilbo is incredibly tempted to flee and run off from the fact that there is this awful heavy silence and bloody everyone is staring at the two of them staring awkwardly at each other. The only thing stopping him from doing so is the fact that Thorin is blocking the damn exit. He was expecting anger, maybe a little yelling, but not this uncharacteristic blank stiffness from Thorin.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo finally clears his throat and looks down at the roll in his hand, tossing it a few times and setting his jaw, mouth moving as it tries to figure out what exactly he\u2019s going to say. \u201cAh, Thorin-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou will excuse me.\u201d Thorin says quickly, voice strangely flat, and he gives another quick nod as he steps back a bit. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can not linger for long. My apologies, Master Baggins, there\u2019s much to be done still. It\u2019s.\u201d And then Thorin stops, and Bilbo can see a brief crack in the carefully forced formal calm when Thorin blinks a few times and looks anywhere in the room but at Bilbo. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you visiting.\u201d He says finally, and gives another awkward nod and turns to leave quickly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo opens his mouth, shuts it, and raises his eyebrows as his innards try to remember where they\u2019re supposed to settle. He had imagined his reunion in a million ways in the months that it took to come back, and that wasn\u2019t anywhere close to any of them. Bilbo can\u2019t even tell if that was worse or better than the most terrible scenarios he\u2019d thought up.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWh-\u201d He starts weakly, then has to stop and blink rapidly as he tries to process all of that.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cM\u2019imnu Mahal!\u201d Dwalin snaps. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re going to do something \u2018bout that now you\u2019re here!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWh-? What? What do you-? What on earth was all-?\u201d Bilbo gestures vaguely at the doorway, still staring wide eyed at it. \u201cWas that? What was that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat was\u2026\u201d Balin starts awkwardly, then sighs and shrugs his shoulders. \u201cWell you did leave a bit suddenly. And I don't think any of us really expected you to come back after the way you took off. I don't believe Thorin ah...had much time to prepare.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah well that\u2019s because he-!\u201d Bilbo stops, flushing as he remembers Thorin\u2019s earnest and hopeful eyes and the large hands holding on to his. Then he notices the Company all shifting awkwardly and glancing around at each other. \u201cAnd speaking of that!\u201d Bilbo grits, narrowing his eyes at the guilty looking dwarves and pointing a finger out, waving it around to make sure all of them know they\u2019re part of this. \u201cAt what point was anyone planning on telling me that I was engaged then? Think someone could have mentioned that before I had a fever-muddled king calling me his betrothed?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSilence.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe uh,\u201d Bofur grins apologetically, \u201cwell we thought you already knew. I mean you two were already-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBalin shakes his head rapidly and Bofur stops, staring at Balin, then at Bilbo, his eyes widening. The other dwarves all swivel their heads around to stare between them as well, ten sets of eyes widening in surprise. Bilbo\u2019s hands curl into fists at his sides while he glares at the two of them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe were what?\u201d Bilbo asks cooly, raising his eyebrows as all the dwarves stare at him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"No.\" Bofur says, directing it more at Balin than Bilbo. \"Y'weren't already...? You weren't already together?\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Bilbo snaps, throwing his hands up. \u201cNo we were not! I had no idea! None! And I thought you all just knew about the engagement! Not that everyone but ME was going about assuming that-\u201d\n\u201cHow did you not know?\u201d Nori asks, completely flummoxed. \u201cHow could anyone not know?! We all had to watch Thorin all but throwin\u2019 himself at you every damned day!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think-!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut at Laketown!\u201d Bofur interrupts, pointing back at Bilbo. \u201cYou went upstairs! You two-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI dragged him upstairs to get him to sleep! Because he was a drunk idiot and we needed to face a dragon in the morning! What on earth did you think-\u201d He stops at the shocked faces on all the dwarves, except for Balin, who stares guiltily at the wall, and Dwalin who is shaking his head in disgust.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBalin?\u201d Bilbo asks, narrowing his glare at the white haired dwarf.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh! Well.\u201d Balin starts, smiling nervously. \u201cI knew you two weren\u2019t...well Thorin and I had talked about it you see. He wanted to wait until the quest was completed and-\u201d He stops and shrugs with a smile as if everything is obvious. Which it most certainly is not.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Bilbo prompts, crossing his arms.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou accepted the mithril!\u201d Bofur snaps his fingers, grinning like he\u2019s very proud for having caught Bilbo out. Balin coughs and starts shaking his head again, but Bilbo is already on it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe said it was a token of friendship! I thought it was a nice friendship gift!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDwalin snarls something to himself in Khuzdul, and Bilbo decides that it\u2019s not worth asking for a translation. Bofur sputters in indignant shock.\n\n  \n\n\"It's bloody mithril, isn't it?! You thought mithril was-\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was going to tell you what that was about.\u201d Balin says quickly. \u201cI knew what he had meant by it and that you weren\u2019t ah, quite as aware. The significance of the value of mithril is easily lost on those who don't know the history of our culture. But then you had run off with the stone and...well.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat calms Bilbo fast, memories of the chaos and the wild hurt rage in Thorin\u2019s eyes as hands fisted in Bilbo\u2019s shirt and nearly sent him over the wall. Fine, that\u2019s an excuse he\u2019ll accept. He nods a bit, hands clenching and unclenching at his sides.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe question.\u201d Dwalin growls. \u201cIs now what? Since we\u2019ve all been updated one everyone\u2019s emotions.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey all turn to stare at Bilbo, who is reconsidering running off.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He asks nervously. \u201cWhat are you- alright! Alright fine I. Yes. I thought about it. I wanted to, to talk to Thorin. About...the whole thing. That he decided to spring on me. I just needed- well. I came back for you all too. I-\u201d He rubs a hand over his face, wincing at the earnest grins all directed at him. \u201cNo nono stop that all of you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe missed you too laddie!\u201d Gloin shouts.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cStupid decision.\u201d Bilbo mutters into his palm. \u201cMad. Absolutely mad. I must be. I left all the quiet and peace-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell that sounds dull,\u201d Bofur gets up to walk over and clap Bilbo on the back. \u201cJust you and yer plants and yer dishtowels full of holes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crochet.\u201d Bilbo sighs into his hands, barely keeping himself from completely breaking down into a fit of crying or laughing, he isn\u2019t sure which. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to look like that, and it\u2019s a doily.\u201d He looks up, feeling a bit hysterical. But there\u2019s also a bit that needs to be done before he can work himself up into a complete nervous meltdown. \u201cRight then. I need. I have to. Can anyone tell me where Thorin would have gone?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh that.\u201d Bofur laughs. \u201cI imagine he\u2019s up on guard.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo blinks, frowns, and blinks again. \u201cOn what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUp on the front wall.\u201d Balin explains.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cY\u2019see.\u201d Bofur explains. \u201cWhenever our good King needs some alone time-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhenever he\u2019s off to sulk.\u201d Dwalin growls.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRight, yes. That too. Anyway. What he does is he goes up and relieves the guard from his duty up on the wall with some excuse about kings taking part in the workings of the kingdom. And there he broods all by his noble self.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat did sound like Thorin. Bilbo takes a deep breath, shuts his eyes, and counts as he lets it out slowly. He can't put this off. Not after all this time, after this journey and after that painful reunion earlier. The feast laid out in front of him is forgotten as he keeps slowly breathing and working his nerves up. If he doesn't do this now he'll just be an anxious wreck for the rest of the night.\n\n  \n\n\u201cOkay. Right. Alright. I-I uh. I guess I\u2019ll be heading to the wall then.\u201d\n\n  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \n\n\nBilbo\u2019s head is still swimming from the blow he\u2019d taken earlier, and he can feel the trickle of blood down the side of his face that he can\u2019t be bothered to wipe away. The world is still heaving around him, sounds reaching him slowly as he stumbles through the stone walls and staircases, trying to find ANYTHING. Because there had been so many orcs, swarming like insects over the walls. Too many to count, too many to comprehend. But now there isn\u2019t anything but screaming wind and snow and his blood dripping down his face.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nHe stumbles, catches himself on a large stone block, and hears his own harsh breathing echoing in his head, drowning out everything else.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThen he looks up. And Thorin\u2019s standing on the ice, back to Bilbo, and overlooking the battle far, far below.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThe relief is like a veil lifting away from him, making the world clearer and making his vision settle. Thorin\u2019s standing. Thorin\u2019s alright. Thorin\u2019s standing with shoulders back, the pale orc lying with Orcrist sticking from his chest in the middle of the ice, and in that moment everything is alright again. For a few soaring seconds, Bilbo can breathe and feel the small smile of relief that at the end of all this, Thorin is alright and alive and standing.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nThorin\u2019s knees buckle. Bilbo\u2019s lungs stop. Thorin falls, a slow tipping to his side until he finally crashes down hard, lying back in a heap.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cNo. Nono no no!\u201d Bilbo\u2019s fingers scramble against frozen stone as he flings himself over and onto the ice, nearly falling several times and his breath stopping and gasping, leaving him coughing on the dry, icy air as he runs as fast as he can to where Thorin\u2019s lying.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nNo it isn\u2019t happening like this. Not after all this. Not after Thorin is finally back and finally himself again, not after the dragon and the fire and the terror of the past few weeks. This isn\u2019t the end, this can\u2019t be the end!\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cThorin!\u201d He drops to his knees besides the King, and this small, broken dwarf can\u2019t be Thorin. Thorin doesn\u2019t breathe shallowly and stare blankly up at the sky, fight gone and eyes glazed. He doesn\u2019t simply lie down and accept.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cBilbo.\u201d Thorin breathes, eyes focusing on the hobbit\u2019s face.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cLie still, Thorin lie still. Just. It\u2019s just.\u201d He reaches over and there\u2019s blood, gods there\u2019s so much blood. Bilbo nearly gags at it, at the sharp scent of it and the warmth against his fingers. There\u2019s so much blood pulsing from a deep stab through Thorin\u2019s side. Bilbo tries desperately to remember everything Oin had taught him about healing, as the dwarf slowly explained wraps and salves and different quick battle patches. He check\u2019s Thorin\u2019s face and there\u2019s no blood coming from his mouth, no red between the pale lips so his lungs are alright. That\u2019s the extent of Bilbo\u2019s knowledge though, and he fight\u2019s down the nausea building in his stomach and clamps a hand tight down over the wound.\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cHold on Thorin, just hold on.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cBilbo\u2026I-\"\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare, don\u2019t you dare. It\u2019s going to be alright Thorin. The eagles are here. The eagles are here we\u2019ll be alright. Just don\u2019t, don\u2019t you dare\u2026.don\u2019t...\u201d It repeats over and over in his mind. \u2018Don\u2019t you dare. Don\u2019t you dare leave. Dont you dare leave me in a world where you don\u2019t exist. Don\u2019t you dare let go.\u2019\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nDon\u2019t let go.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \n\nBilbo can\u2019t keep his hands still as he walks up the steps in the main hall that lead to the guard wall. They tap against his legs, twist around each other, clench and unclench as he steps out into the clear night. It\u2019s cool out, but not cold, and Bilbo thinks it a bit funny that he keeps coming to Erebor right at Autumn.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin is easy to find, standing in the center of the wall, arms out and braced as he leans heavily against the ramparts and looks down at the sheer drop. Bilbo swallows, and remembers looking over his shoulder at a very similar height. This wall is cleaner, the stones set firm and the ramparts decorated with interlocking chains and complex geometric designs interspersed with carved ravens. But it\u2019s still familiar enough to make Bilbo tense and remember when he nearly became very well acquainted with that fall.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI remember it all.\u201d Thorin says softly, and for once Bilbo\u2019s the one jumps a bit, then shuffles guiltily when he realizes he must not have been as quiet as he had assumed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d He answers, swallowing as he leans his elbows on the stone a ways down the wall from Thorin, looking out at the night and definitely not down.\u201cYes. Well, I like this wall a great deal more.\"\u00a0He goes on. \u201cIt\u2019s nicer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Thorin\u2019s voice is even quieter, a whisper that is almost carried away by the wind. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, for all of it. For the things I said, for-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThorin, it\u2019s alright.\u201d Bilbo interrupts quickly, not sure he can really handle the vulnerable quake in Thorin\u2019s voice right now. \u201cIt really\u2026\u201d and for a few moments it isn\u2019t the terror of the drop, the rage and snarl in Thorin\u2019s voice then that he thinks of, but the soft broken way he had said 'you would steal from me?' and the pained tears in his eyes. And gods, that look hits him so much harder now, now that he knows what the gift of mithril had meant, what Thorin had thought of them in his sick mind. Even then, Thorin had been sick, but he had later said the heart behind it was true. And for the better or not, knowingly or not, Bilbo had still thrown that in his face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Bilbo sighs. \u201cWhatever my reasons were, I betrayed you. And I didn\u2019t...it wasn\u2019t what I wanted. That was the hardest thing I did, and a few times I had been so close to giving it to you, just because I knew how badly you wanted it. I never wanted to betray you. Handing that stone over was-. I knew I was hurting you and I couldn\u2019t-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou did what you had to.\u201d Thorin says, still not looking up from the wall. \u201cYou were right, to not give it to me, to take it away and know not to follow me into death and ruin. You were the only one who saw what was best for the company, for me. \u00a0Your only mistake was coming back after you did it. You always-\u201d Thorin stops, breathes in slowly, and pushes himself away from the wall to stand fully. \u201cMy apologies. These shouldn\u2019t be the sort of memories you dwell on during your stay.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhere\u2026\u201d Bilbo sniffs, and taps his fingers on the cold stone, trying to find the best way to ask what could be a very dangerous question. \u201cWhere is it now? The arkenstone?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDeep.\u201d Thorin says, voice solid. \u201cIt\u2019s back down in the depths of the mountain. Sealed within a tomb dedicated to those who lost their lives in this place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo nods. \u201cGood. That, that\u2019s good. It\u2019s a good place for it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe silence that falls over them isn\u2019t quite as painful as the one that came on with the company, but it\u2019s still heavy. It presses down on Bilbo as he tries not to obviously watch Thorin, who is stiffly looking out away from Bilbo.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wonders how many times Thorin came up here and just got lost in his own head, trapped in memories and regrets and unable to see what was happening now. Too lost in the ruins to see how much life and light he's brought to the mountain again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019ve both been morons, really. And Bilbo sighs as he walks up to Thorin, who refuses to look at him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThorin-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow long will you be visiting us?\u201d Thorin asks quickly, head turning away just slightly to look out at the hills, voice back to that forcibly stiff and formal grit. Bilbo stops, and it finally hits him what\u2019s happening, why Thorin is standing stiff and formal and unusually forced into this unnatural politeness.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He asks, eyes narrowing and taking in Thorin's tense shoulders, the hand out on the wall and fingers tapping against the stone.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always...you can stay as long as you like. I\u2019ll have Balin arrange a place for you, if you wish to spend your time in Erebor. It may be wise to wait until the spring, when it will be easier to cross the mountains back to the Shi-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou idiot!\u201d Bilbo yells. Thorin finally looks at him at that, taken aback and wide eyed. \u201cYou absolute idiot! I can\u2019t believe-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin stares at him like he just now realized Bilbo existed, and wasn\u2019t sure how he got there. \u201cWhat?\u201d He asks, hesitant.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou-! Why do you think I came back? Why do you think I hitched myself up to a bunch of dwarvish merchants and spent months coming all the way back to this bloody mountain!?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t-?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a king! You\u2019re supposed to be able to catch on to things! You absolute moron! A visit!\u201d Bilbo reaches up and tugs the collar of his shirt aside a bit, showing the mithril he\u2019s worn since he left the Shire far behind him. \u201cA visit! Really?!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin freezes, eyebrows furrowed in confusion for a moment, before he catches sight of the silvery gleam and his eyes go wide. He\u2019s still for a few moments then exhales in an unsteady huff, his shoulders slumping and face open, full of disbelief as he reaches up to take Bilbo\u2019s collar, tugging it down and to the side to show more of the mail beneath.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy do you think I came back?\u201d Bilbo shakes his head, laughing a little and heart wild in his chest. \u201cYou complete, utter, incredible moron.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin swallows, and Bilbo can feel the fingers shaking where they grip his shirt, and the dwarf just stares at the mithril. He looks briefly up at Bilbo\u2019s face, expression shell shocked and dazed, then looks back at the metal shirt.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI just needed to think!\u201d Bilbo goes on. \u201cThorin, I needed to actually think! Away from all the pressure here! I had no idea that you- that there was all that. I\u2019d never dared to hope for any of that! You\u2019re-. Well you\u2019re you! You\u2019re Thorin Oakenshield, the king and warrior and everything else you\u2019ve become. I\u2019m just-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBilbo.\u201d Thorin breathes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo swallows, and is afraid he may do something incredibly embarrassing. Like swoon. Fortunately his legs stay good and steady and he reaches up to hold the hand still gripping his shirt. \u201cYeah. Yeah that. Look this-\u201d He takes a deep breath, once again regretting that he never took the time to rehearse this. \u201cThis is mad and irregular, but you kind of make me do mad and irregular things pretty...well...pretty regularly. I-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe has to take a few seconds to breathe, and it\u2019s hard to keep control of that when Thorin is looking him full in the face now, the look of wonder and awe that Bilbo had seen so many times returning with wide eyes and slack, parted lips.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI. Ok. I\u2019m for it. Alright? The- the marriage. That whole thing. That idea. I\u2019m. Yes. Yeah. I-you...I love you. Alright? And I did before but I had to get my head around the fact that that wasn\u2019t a bad thing and that you were actually a thing that I could- Yeah. So I came back for that. Because I want-. That wasn\u2019t home anymore. And I\u2019m thinking this could be. A home. With you. If you-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin breathes out, making a soft, wordless sound and the hand on Bilbo\u2019s collar slides around to the back of his neck. It pulls him forward as Thorin leans down and presses their foreheads together, breathing unsteadily in the space between them while Bilbo can feel a hysterical smile coming over his face again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe reaches up and rests his hands on Thorin\u2019s upper arms, fingers tensing nervously against the fur and leather. Thorin\u2019s hair is draping around them again, and now he can close his eyes and let himself feel the closeness of it, the heat coming from Thorin and the soft brush of air between them as they breathe. Thorin\u2019s hand moves from the back of Bilbo\u2019s head to slide to his jaw, the other one coming up so Bilbo\u2019s face is cupped gently between the warm and calloused palms.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBilbo.\u201d Thorin says, barely over a whisper. \u201cI am going to kiss you now, and I would prefer if I not get yelled at for it this time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nOh help him he really might swoon. \u201cI\u2019ll yell at you if you don\u2019t kiss me you utter-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t get a chance to finish what was sure to be a fantastic insult, as Thorin tilts his face up between his palms and swoops in, pressing his lips to Bilbo\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd this, this is a proper kiss. Bilbo can\u2019t even be ashamed when he sways and grabs onto Thorin\u2019s sleeves to steady himself. It\u2019s warm and soft and firm all at once, and he feels like he\u2019s completely surrounded by the dry palms against his face, thumbs gently stroking over his cheeks, the scratch of beard and the steady press of Thorin\u2019s lips. He sighs out and relaxes into it, getting enough of a mental grip to lean up into this kiss, pressing back and feeling a swoop of elation as Thorin instantly responds by stepping in to press fully against Bilbo\u2019s front.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin breaks it first, though he barely moves away, just moves his head to kiss Bilbo\u2019s cheek and press their faces together, arms wrapping around him and pulling him tight against his body. Bilbo laughs a little, feeling like his insides have been replaced with fireworks, like the only thing keeping him on the ground is the heavy, solid warmth of Thorin holding on to him. He buries his face against the thick black hair and reaches up to wrap his arms around Thorin\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI did not think I would see you again.\u201d Thorin says, soft and wondrous. \u201cWhen the raven returned with news that you had arrived safe, I thought it would be the last I would hear of you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIdiot.\u201d Bilbo grins, tightening his arms around Thorin and laughing when Thorin returns the gesture with a low chuckle of his own. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about...about how I left. I was overwhelmed but it\u2019s no excuse for just-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin moves again, stopping Bilbo with another, gentler kiss that\u2019s barely a touch of lips. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d He says, whispering the words against Bilbo\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou came back. You always come back.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re always so surprised.\u201d Bilbo grins on, giddy with everything. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be back. The Shire was...you were right, it\u2019s too small now. I couldn\u2019t just go back and be only me when I kept thinking of everyone here. Of you. And you were right about here, you\u2019ve done so much in so little time. This is a home again. I think it really could be my home now.\u201d He swallows and quietly finishes. \u201cOur home.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOurs.\u201d Thorin breathes. \u201cAmr\u00e2l\u2019im\u2019\u00ea.\u201d He tilts his head for another kiss, and Bilbo can feel the shift in this one. He can feel it in the way Thorin\u2019s arms pull him in tight, lifting him a little into the dwarf\u2019s body and in the way Thorin presses their mouths with a sure focus, catching Bilbo\u2019s bottom lip between his own before moving to the top lip. All at once Bilbo\u2019s aware of the cool air on his face, of Thorin\u2019s hands sliding up and down his back in firm, broad strokes and of the thick hair caught up in his own fingers.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt really can\u2019t be Autumn, not with how warm it is, awfully warm. Bilbo\u2019s breath hitches a bit when he feels the soft, questioning brush of a tongue on his lips, a quick flash of heat as Thorin\u2019s hands tuck up under his shirt, pressing warm through the cool mithril. Bilbo inhales, opens his mouth and tightens his arms around Thorin, fully aware that he\u2019s practically holding himself up now. But even that nearly fails him at the low groan against his mouth, the fingers gripping at his back and biting cold mithril links into his skin while Thorin\u2019s tongue slides hot against his own.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEverything goes blurry, he\u2019s a bit aware that they\u2019re still fully out on the wall and only technically alone, and that this is a bit fast and not anything he\u2019s really had any more experience with. But Thorin presses into him with a light scrape of teeth, bruising Bilbo\u2019s lips and making low sounds that Bilbo can feel rumbling through the chest pressed against him and this is all very very far from sweet little kisses shared with flowers and shy smiles in the Shire.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe has to be the one to break the kiss this time, just to suck down cool air and try to get his heart back under control. Thorin\u2019s no help, no help at all on that front. Bilbo\u2019s trying to get his breathing steady and there\u2019s lips dragging over his face, pressing open mouthed and hot along his jawline and quick flashes of the occasional tongue on his neck. No help. Not a bit of help.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThorin-\u201d Bilbo means to point out that they are very much outside, but his voice is embarrassingly breathy and thin. Thorin\u2019s fingers dig into his back and Bilbo feels the groan reverberate against his neck as the dwarf mouths at his pulse and sucks sharply, sending Bilbo\u2019s sentence off into a high, reedy little noise. His hands scramble at Thorin\u2019s back for a second, then fist in his hair and if Bilbo were a bit more in his right mind he\u2019d worry about pulling, though Thorin seems unconcerned.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin moves away from his mark, dragging kisses along Bilbo\u2019s neck up to his ear, which he lightly drags his teeth against and sends Bilbo\u2019s world askew in the process. Bilbo had never really thought much about ears as being particularly intimate, but Thorin is making a very good argument with his teeth and tongue. There are sparks flashing all over him, he\u2019s sure of it. He can\u2019t catch his breath or keep a hold on the tiny noises that escape his throat, and there\u2019s a huff of air that Bilbo suspects is a laugh as Thorin delicately traces the ridges of his ear and sucks the tip into his mouth.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThorin!\u201d And this time Bilbo isn\u2019t really sure what he\u2019s asking for or if he really has a thought behind the whine he makes. He can\u2019t get enough air into his lungs and can barely keep himself upright against this onslaught.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin releases Bilbo\u2019s ear, only to kiss the sensitive skin behind it. \u00a0\u201cStay with me for the night.\u201d He says, his voice is low, heated and smooth. And, it seems, designed solely to grab at something hot and fluttering in Bilbo\u2019s chest. \u201cForever,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut now, for the night.\u201d Just in case Bilbo fails to catch his meaning, he opens his mouth against Bilbo\u2019s neck again, hands sliding down to duck up beneath the mithril shirt, and dragging up along bare skin. \u201cAkhjamu'e amule'm\u00ea, amr\u00e2l\u2019im'\u00ea.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo pants, tightens his fists in Thorin\u2019s hair, and buries his face into his shoulder as he tries to get his head together. Thorin doesn\u2019t let go or loosen his grip, but he does move up to give a gentle, less heated kiss to Bilbo\u2019s temple as Bilbo resettles himself past the rushing in his head.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not that he had never thought about it, there had been the odd moment here or there; when Thorin would hug him, or in the quiet moments where they were sitting close enough that Bilbo could feel the brush of their shoulders with each inhale. But he\u2019d never really let it go on past the light \u2018what if\u2019 fantasies. Though he also hadn\u2019t thought about much beyond general kissing, and that had ended up working out more than alright.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin carefully pulls his hands out from under the mithril, resting them over Bilbo\u2019s shirt and rubbing calm circles against his back. And it\u2019s that, that finally settles him. Bilbo exhales, relaxes against Thorin and lets himself close his eyes and just be held for a few calm moments. It\u2019s the same safe, surrounding feeling he\u2019s always had from Thorin, and it\u2019s no different here than it is with anything else. It\u2019s the steadying support that lets him do mad things and rush into the wild unknown.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, if you do not.\u201d Thorin says gently, lips still pressed to Bilbo\u2019s temple. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Bilbo says suddenly, nodding quickly against Thorin\u2019s shoulder and heart starting to pick up beat again. \u201cI-yeah. Yes. I\u2019m- I can do that. Definitely.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin inhales sharply, and the gentle stroking along his back presses just that much harder against his spine. There\u2019s another quick kiss to his head, then Thorin leans back just slightly, grinning broad and bright. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Bilbo huffs, face heating up. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it if I didn\u2019t want-\u201d Once again, he\u2019s cut off by Thorin pulling him up into a hard kiss, one hand hooked firmly behind his back and the other resting along his jawline. Bilbo flails a bit when he\u2019s nearly lifted off the ground and gets a good grip on Thorin\u2019s back as everything narrows down to hands and teeth and tongues and-\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis stomach interrupts with a loud rumbling sound, and he distantly wonders if perhaps there is another dragon out there that could eat him right then as Thorin freezes. There\u2019s a small pause as Thorin leans back to look down at him with raised eyebrows, and Bilbo opens his mouth right as his stomach makes itself known again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I am so-\u201d Where is that dragon. Where is that dragon so he can just end everything right here. \u201cI got caught up in everything since getting here and I didn\u2019t get a chance to eat anything since- I am so sorry. Can we just-?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin slowly lowers his head to set his forehead heavily on Bilbo\u2019s shoulder with a long, strained sigh. \u201cMahal akhjamu tulmel\u2019e.\u201d He mutters. \u201cSave me from the halflings.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI am so sorry.\u201d Bilbo whispers, absolutely mortified. Thorin huffs out another sigh and grabs onto Bilbo\u2019s head again, pushing their foreheads together with a bit of force and Bilbo really can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s laughing or just shaking.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo. No this is obviously my fault for being an ungracious host.\u201d He says wryly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI um. Probably. I probably should have grabbed something before coming to find you.\u201d Bilbo admits, and Thorin is definitely laughing now, though it\u2019s a tad desperate.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat would have been wise. You also could have mentioned this before saying you wanted to lie with me.\u201d Bilbo clears his throat loudly and feels his face heat up even more, he\u2019s probably letting off steam in the cool air at this point.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI am really, really sorry I didn\u2019t-\u201d He starts stammering out more apologies and Thorin kisses him roughly on the forehead.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go get you something before I change my mind.\u201d \u00a0He sighs, then pulls away, and the cool air is a shock against Bilbo\u2019s front after being pressed against Thorin for so long.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt takes them a bit of time actually getting to the dining hall where he had left the company. Which is entirely Thorin\u2019s fault. Bilbo\u2019s hand is kept in a tight grip as he\u2019s practically dragged through the halls past the groups of surprised looking dwarves. At the pace Thorin is setting, they should have made it there within minutes, except for the fact that whenever there\u2019s any hint of them being alone, Thorin will take the chance to whip around and yank Bilbo into a rough kiss. Things get muddled for a bit and time is lost in grabbing hands and searing heat before Thorin mutters some Khuzdul curse and is dragging Bilbo along again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t need to rush.\u201d Bilbo points out, stumbling a bit to keep up.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes. We do.\u201d Thorin says firmly, marching on to where Bilbo can still hear the rest of the company laughing and yelling. The smell of meats and breads and the rest of the feast hits him and he winces as his stomach rumbles again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to stop in and chat with the rest for a bit?\u201d Bilbo asks, fighting down the wide grin as he\u2019s tugged towards the room. \u201cI need to ask Ori how his knitting is coming along.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin stops dead, whipping his head around to stare at Bilbo in horror. \u201cYou need to do no such thing.\u201d He hisses, and Bilbo can\u2019t stop from laughing at the strained grit in his voice. , Thorin narrows his eyes and tugs Bilbo in sharply, gripping him tight by the arms and leaning in to growl against his lips. \u201cI have waited for over half a year while the quest was underway, then another year in which I thought I had lost you entirely. You will not be so cruel to make me wait while you discuss knitting with Ori. Not when I can offer a much more interesting subject.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo\u2019s mouth goes dry and his heart does an odd flip in his chest, all the heat from the wall rushing back all at once and his laugh is a little high and just a tad hysterical. \u201cWell I imagine he\u2019s come a long way on it, he had some really detailed knit designs and I\u2019d be interested to see-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin crushes their mouths together, and Bilbo wonders if this is going to become a regular way to shut him up. He can\u2019t exactly complain about it, seeing as every kiss so far has left him with his head spinning and his toes curling against the stone. He sighs happily and buries his fingers in the beard along Thorin's jawline, deciding to make good use of the sudden kiss.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a loud cough somewhere behind him, and it\u2019s like a bucket of ice down Bilbo\u2019s spine.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019re right in the bloody doorway.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo you two got that all sorted then?\u201d Bofur asks, cackling as Bilbo cranes his head around, still very much trapped by Thorin\u2019s grip on him, to stare in mortification at the assortment of grinning faces.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh no. No no no no.\u201d Bilbo whines, and Thorin tightens his grip on Bilbo\u2019s arms briefly before shouldering his way between him and the company, completely unphased by the jeering cheers and applause as he strides in. Bilbo covers his face with a hand after Bofur winks at him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo you are aware this time, Master Baggins, of what\u2019s going on now? Or is that bruise just a friendly token?\u201d Bofur asks and Bilbo claps a hand to his neck, voice only managing a high noise of sputtering terror. Any hope from salvation from Thorin vanishes when he sees the wide grin on the king\u2019s face. The absolute bastard. Bilbo is painfully aware of several details; like how mussed Thorin\u2019s hair is, and the fact that his own shirt is awkwardly hitched and untucked around his bracers.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh, Thorin,\u201d Balin smiles and clears his throat, kindly not staring at Bilbo like everyone else while Thorin marches to the table. \u201cThe mastercrafter from the western slope came by, he wanted to know if-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRight. Thought not. Will you two be stay-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Thorin reaches over Gloin to roughly grab a plate piled with rolls and slices of meat. \u201cWe\u2019re taking this, don\u2019t wait for us.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo wonders again if the dragon could show back up and kill him off right now. The company is all grinning hugely at him, and Bifur gives him and enthusiastic thumbs up as Thorin turns with his plate.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"I might faint.\u201d He informs Thorin as the dwarf marches back to him. Thorin just puts a hand on his back and firmly takes him back out of the room, grinning at the applause and cheers that follow them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI really might. That was mortifying. That was absolutely one of the worst-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell they would have found out eventually.\u201d Thorin shrugs, not seeming to understand what an absolute problem it is that they're being seen off with shouts of what he's sure are absolute filth in Khuzdul. Bilbo grits his teeth and realizes that this is not something that he is going to win. Dwarves.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHere.\u201d Thorin says, shoving a roll of bread into Bilbo\u2019s hands as they walk. \u201cEat that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you trying to fill me up before we get to your rooms?\u201d Bilbo asks, his smile coming back as he bites into the roll.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes. I am. I only have so much patience and you are testing it.\u201d Thorin steers them up wide steps lined with grim looking statues of crowned dwarves towards a set of wide, solid oak doors.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything.\u201d Bilbo points out, grinning at the look Thorin gives him as he pushes the door open.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wasn\u2019t really sure what he was expecting from the King\u2019s chambers, and he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s surprised or not. The high, vaulted ceiling is expected, and the large pillars carved with crowned ravens and huge stone axes certainly fit in with the grandeur of the rest of the mountain. A fireplace that\u2019s easily as tall as an elf, already lit with a roaring fire, fills the room with a gentle gold light that softens the dark stone and sharp geometric lines criss-crossing over every available surface. The walls are draped in blue and a deep red, banners showing a raven perched on an oak branch lining the walls. There\u2019s a table covered in papers, a separate table and chair with a pitcher and a few solid, silvery cups, and thin veins of gold through the stone adding a fluid organic look to the otherwise sharp and measured space.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo silently notes that besides the natural veins of unmined metal, there isn\u2019t a glimmer of gold in the room, and a few places of suspiciously scraped stone.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cA far cry from a cozy hobbit hole, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Thorin says quietly as he shuts the door. There\u2019s a smile like he\u2019s trying to pass it off as a joke, but Bilbo can hear the little question in it and smiles warmly around the honestly intimidating space.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s not too bad.\u201d He says, looking up at the daunting pillars and harsh rock. \u201cA few little homey touches here and there, is all it needs.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin sets the plate down at the table and pulls Bilbo to him by the hand, sighing softly and holding him loosely as he kisses him on the forehead. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Bilbo gives a quick kiss to Thorin\u2019s cheek, tugging lightly on one of his braids. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I brought my furniture with me then.\u201d He steps away to sit at the table, grinning at Thorin\u2019s dumbfounded expression.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid you really?\u201d Thorin asks, keeping a hand on Bilbo\u2019s back as he pulls a chair up as close as he can besides the hobbit, looking slightly dazed. Bilbo nods, grabbing a bit of roast and shoving it between the halves of two loaves. He holds a bit out to Thorin, who just shakes his head and continues lightly running his hand up and down Bilbo\u2019s back.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI have a whole cart that Balin has tucked away somewhere.\u201d He explains between bites. \u201cPacked up my favorite belongings from Bag End, wrote up a will, and left everything else to my cousins.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou really came meaning to stay here.\u201d Thorin says, eyes wide and staring at Bilbo like he was some incredible, awe inspiring thing. As if it\u2019s absolutely amazing that Bilbo did something as simple as pack up and leave the Shire. Bilbo shrugs and busies himself with his food, face flushing at the open wonder in Thorin\u2019s face, and flushing more as the hand on his back slides up to lightly play with the hair along the nape of his neck.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes. Well. That\u2019s usually what goes along with accepting marriage proposals. Or at least knowingly accepting them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin\u2019s laugh is a quick little exhale, and he leans in to kiss Bilbo\u2019s temple, which Bilbo is starting to suspect will definitely be a regular thing. The hand on his neck shifts into an arm around his shoulders, holding him as Thorin buries his face in Bilbo\u2019s hair with a brushing sigh. They sit like that in the comfortable silence that Bilbo\u2019s always loved between them. Thorin simply breathing against him and Bilbo enjoying the warmth and the first meal he's had since leaving Dale earlier in the day.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve calmed down a bit.\u201d Bilbo notes, reaching up to rest his hand over the one cupping his shoulder.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure you\u2019re actually here.\u201d Thorin admits in a small voice, and Bilbo can feel the shift of his breath against his hair. \u201cI have dreamed-\u201d Thorin stops, and the hand under Bilbo\u2019s turns to grip at his fingers. \u201cYou really did not know?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo turns his head a little, nuzzling along Thorin\u2019s scruffy jawline. \u201cThat seems to be the question everyone\u2019s been asking me. But no, until you woke up and started babbling your fool head off, I had no idea.\u201d He chuckles, smiling when Thorin tilts his head into the nuzzling and keeps it there. \u201cThere may have been some willful ignorance on my part.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was not exactly trying to hide it at the end.\u201d Thorin huffs, fingers shifting a bit to weave in with Bilbo\u2019s. \u201cI thought that you knew. That we were both simply waiting for a better time. It was not until after I...after the sickness. When I thought I had-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell we were both quite the idiots.\u201d Bilbo says quickly, before Thorin could start spiraling into self loathing regret again. He turns his head to kiss Thorin\u2019s cheek again. \u201cWe got it all sorted out though.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe did.\u201d Thorin agrees, pulling back just enough to move in and kiss Bilbo as carefully as he had the first time. Bilbo tilts his head into it, and Thorin moves his other hand to rest against Bilbo\u2019s side. It\u2019s calm, soft and inviting and unrushed, and Bilbo leans in and lets just the slow drag of lips and the broad hand on his ribs take over.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe build is slow, gradual and steady. It\u2019s in a hand cupping his jaw, fingertips stroking along his cheekbones, the arm around his shoulders pulling him in and Thorin\u2019s shaking sigh when Bilbo opens his mouth into the kiss, hesitantly running his tongue along the seam of Thorin\u2019s lips.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt picks up quickly after that, when Thorin sucks his tongue into his own mouth, scraping teeth over his lips and digging fingers into the soft skin at the crook of Bilbo\u2019s jaw. \u201cPlease tell me,\u201d Thorin murmurs, nipping at Bilbo\u2019s bottom lip and continuing to press small kisses to the corners of his mouth between words, \u201cthat you\u2019ve had enough food now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo blinks rapidly, taking a few moments to process words, or how to put them into a coherent sentence. It takes another few moments to get his tingling and swollen lips to cooperate enough to form said words. \u201cWhat? Yeah. Yes. Yes I\u2019m fine now, that was fine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d Thorin growls, both hands suddenly grabbing at Bilbo\u2019s waist and unceremoniously hauling him over. Bilbo squawks and flails for a second as he\u2019s yanked onto Thorin\u2019s lap, face heating up again. He feels like he should really put his foot down on this sort of rough handling, but Thorin\u2019s mouth is back at his neck and he\u2019s having trouble remembering what he\u2019s protesting. So instead he decides it\u2019s best to just let it happen, and he settles fully astride Thorin\u2019s thighs, heart pounding and breath catching as he runs his fingers through the long black hair in front of him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin\u2019s hands slide down his back, gripping briefly at Bilbo\u2019s rear and tugging him in closer and oh Shire\u2019s hills and rivers. There\u2019s heat pooling down low and, more importantly, he can feel the press of heat against his inner thigh. His lungs nearly stop up entirely and he\u2019s sure his heart does. His voice cracks on a small sound as it hits him that this is definitely happening and Thorin is definitely tugging at his bracers while pressing hard against his leg. This isn\u2019t some dream to be quickly shoved away in the morning, and all of a sudden Bilbo can\u2019t get it going fast enough.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt should be terrifying, and in a way is. But it\u2019s the adrenaline rush of the unknown, his heart pounding and his head swimming as he quickly shrugs his bracers off. Thorin\u2019s fingers dig in briefly, then slide around and up, fumbling at Bilbo\u2019s shirt buttons as he keeps pressing hot, open kisses that are mostly tongue and teeth against every bit of skin exposed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThorin.\u201d Bilbo\u2019s voice catches and he has to swallow a bit to get it working again, shivering when Thorin groans deep against the skin at the base of his throat. \u201cThorin wait-wait just a. No no don\u2019t stop don\u2019t- you\u2019re fine let me just-\u201d He unwinds his hands from the death grip they had on Thorin\u2019s hair and scrambles a bit at his shirt buttons, making faster work of it than Thorin\u2019s fumbling. He leans back and laughs breathlessly when Thorin shoves the shirt down his arms as soon as the last button opens, throwing it to the side and reattaching his mouth to Bilbo\u2019s collarbone.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHold on hold on.\u201d Bilbo huffs, laughing again when Thorin snarls some Khuzdul when he leans away from the kisses. \u201cLet me-\u201d He quickly tugs the mithril collar up over his head, and within seconds there are hands sliding up his bare sides and lifting the metal shirt up and off of him with a slow, deliberate reverence. Bilbo lifts his arms and lets Thorin carefully pull the mithril up over him, feeling a reversed version of the heavy, careful meaning that had hung in the air when Thorin had first held it out for Bilbo to put on. Thorin\u2019s less careless than he was with Bilbo\u2019s overshirt, carefully taking the mithril and laying it on the table, not taking his eyes from Bilbo the entire time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo had never put enough thought into his body to be self conscious. There was never anyone to see it, and whenever they did it wasn\u2019t in situations where Bilbo cared what he looked like. But now Thorin\u2019s hands are settling against his side as Thorin openly stares at him with wide, dark eyes, dragging his gaze over Bilbo\u2019s exposed torso, and Bilbo tries to fight the urge to squirm under the heavy look. He\u2019s painfully aware of how generally unbuilt he is. His shoulders are laughable compared to Thorin\u2019s broad build, and while by hobbit standards he\u2019s waifish, there\u2019s still a softness to his midsection and he knows that whatever muscles he\u2019s gained over the journey, while impressive for halflings, are softened by curves of plumpness.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe callouses on Thorin\u2019s palms, much thicker on his right than his left, catch at Bilbo\u2019s comparatively tender skin and make everything feel ten times more sensitive. Bilbo does start to squirm a bit under the slow, steady drags over him, sliding up his middle then down his arms, pausing to dip fingers into the soft skin at his belly and feel his ribs through his flesh.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAbn\u00e2m\u2019sulum.\u201d Thorin breathes, one hand continuing it\u2019s slow exploration of Bilbo\u2019s torso while the other slides up to rest along his neck. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d He goes on, and Bilbo has to lean in and kiss him hard before anything else comes out and makes him combust on the spot.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is really unfair\u201d Bilbo points out, tugging a bit on Thorin\u2019s collar, and the dwarf laughs warmly, kissing down along Bilbo\u2019s jaw.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m enjoying myself.\u201d He says, grinning wide against Bilbo\u2019s skin. Bilbo snorts and tugs sharply at one of his braids, flushing when Thorin keeps dragging his hands over him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d He says, climbing off with some difficulty and tugging at Thorin. \u201cGet up. I don\u2019t want to think about how long it\u2019ll take to get you out of all those layers.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThought about it much?\u201d Thorin asks, grin absolutely wicked as he pushes himself up and right into Bilbo\u2019s space. It hits Bilbo very suddenly how much bigger Thorin is, in height and in general breadth, and how much smaller Bilbo feels with his bare skin hitting the air and Thorin leaning over him, hooking a finger under his jaw to tilt his face up into a slow, deep kiss.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCome on.\u201d Bilbo says again, voice a tad unsteady when he breaks from the kiss. He tugs at Thorin's wide belt with far more daring than he really feels. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t understand over half the clasps or ties on all of this, and I don\u2019t really have the patience to figure them out right now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin chuckles, rich and deep, and leans down to keep pressing kiss after kiss to Bilbo's mouth, moving from lip to lip and corner to corner while he slowly unclasps his belt and lets it fall with a heavy thunk to the floor. Bilbo grabs at his head and pulls him down for a deeper kiss, face flushing and eyes shut against Thorin's curled smile and the shifting of cloth and clinks of mail. Thorin is slow, methodical, and it's almost too intimate for Bilbo to watch, so he keeps his eyes closed and focuses on Thorin's lips on his and his tongue in his mouth while his heart pounds heavy as each layer falls to the floor with an audible rustle or thump.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe's only allowed to shut it out for so long, then there are large hands enveloping his own, tugging them out of Thorin's hair and pulling them down steadily. Bilbo feels the thin, supple cloth of Thorin's undershirt brushing against his fingertips and then Thorin's guiding his hands up and under. His palms hit skin and Bilbo has to stop there for a second, breathing heavily against Thorin's mouth and slowly settling his hands against Thorin's sides. It's softer than expected, but it's like the softness of fine suede leather over steel. There's no give to Thorin's skin, just a slight suppleness and hard muscle and steady heat.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo's eyes stay shut and he's horribly aware that his hand are shaking when he gets the courage to slide them up along Thorin's sides. It may be worse, he realizes, not looking. Because he's left feeling every dip and rise of a scar under his palm and the firm hills of Thorin's muscles. He can feel every catch in Thorin's lungs and how it goes with the sharp sounds of his inhales, hitching as Bilbo continues his slow journey, the shirt bunching up over his wrists.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Are you alright?\" Thorin asks, voice low, hoarse, and tinged with concern.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Yeah. Yeah I'm alright. It's alright. Very alright. I just-there's a lot of.\" Skin. There is a lot of skin. And a lot of Thorin. He's being ridiculous, he realizes, and grits his jaw in annoyance at his own absurdity and forces his eyes open. And everything is worse and so, so much better. Because he can see his hands up to Thorin's chest, the shirt rucked up and showing what is indeed, a lot of skin. And muscle. And the line of dark hair running down the center of Thorin's stomach down into his pants. And the very, very defined bulge in said pants, which Bilbo stares at for a few seconds longer than is decent before looking up and freezing at Thorin's dark stare.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin grins, wide and full of teeth, and pulls his shirt the rest of the way off, letting it fall into a pile on the floor with Bilbo's shirt and kissing Bilbo's slack jawed expression away.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThings were slow before, steady drags and hot molasses in the air and the sudden, tumbled rush is like a long fall. When Thorin pulls him in there's skin on skin and hands on his skin and skin under his hands. There's Thorin's heartbeat pounding against him and when he flings his arms over Thorin's shoulders to hold himself up there's hard muscle bunched under his gripping fingers. His voice cracks on the smallest, breathiest sound and Thorin's low growl in answer shoots right down his spine. All the shyness that had overcome him just seconds ago goes flying down the mountain as he grasps at skin and muscle and practically climbs Thorin, who hauls him up and half stumbles, half carries him to the bed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere's a bit of a confused tumble after Thorin tried throwing him down onto the thick fur blanket and was foiled by the fact that Bilbo wouldn't let go of his shoulders. They nearly go falling right back off onto the floor in a pile of grabbing hands and locked lips but Bilbo manages to break away enough to scramble back fully onto the bed. He's barely up and on it before Thorin's on him again, bowling him over with a hard kiss and heavy weight that pushes him back into the soft mattress. He runs his hands up and down Thorin's back, pressed down and surrounded and whining softly at the crush of it all and feeling certain that Thorin's hands holding and grabbing at him are the only things keeping him together.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Amral'im\u00ea.\" Thorin pants into the kiss, the word falling against Bilbo's parted lips and Bilbo can only manage a small little noise in response, his harsh breathing echoing loud and crashing in his head. Thorin settles more fully over him and he parts his legs to accomodate without thinking about it, without preparing for feeling Thorin's erection press through cloth against his own with a nearly unbearable heat and throbbing pressure.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Fas\u00e2k, Bilbo.\" Thorin groans, deep and wrecked. Bilbo only whimpers softly, head falling back on the fur and lungs heaving at desperate grabs for air.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin kisses him on his forehead, his nose, his cheeks. \"Are you alright?\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Wh-? What?\" Bilbo blinks, whines again when he shifts and feels Thorin against his erection, and tries to remember how talking worked. \"What? Yes. Yes alright I'm ok Thorin, don't- please don't try and ask me to be coherent right now!\" Thorin makes a low sound and presses his forehead to Bilbo's, forearms braced on either side of the hobbit's head and locking him in as he hesitantly rolls his hips. The hot, grinding drag and pressure has Bilbo clawing at Thorin's back, voice catching on little broken noises with every other gasp of air, though his little sounds are lost in Thorin's wrecked, growling moan.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Fas\u00e2k!\" He hisses again, hips starting a slow, steady roll against Bilbo's. \"Bilbo. Tell me if you want- if I need to-\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Yes yes alright just-\" Bilbo lifts his hips back, biting his lip at the pressure that's too much and definitely not enough. \"Just yes to whatever you're thinking. Stop asking me if I'm alright I can barely think right now.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"If you don't-\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"If I don't like something I'll hit you!\" Bilbo snaps, tempted to start hitting the fool dwarf right now for delaying things. \"So far whatever you're wanting has been fantastic so just- oh hell!\" Thorin took Bilbo's words to heart, and cuts his line of thought off with a sharp grind of his hips and teeth nipping at his ear.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Izril'\u00ea 'ubd'm\u00ea maigrifi'\u00ea.\" Thorin gasps, rough and wrecked against Bilbo's ear and Bilbo has no idea what he's saying but nods anyway, biting his lip when Thorin leans back just enough to get to the button of Bilbo's trousers and yank them down. Bilbo is so far past self consciousness and eagerly lifts his hips, flailing his legs a bit to kick the offending cloth away and is quickly sitting up and pulling at the string of Thorin's pants.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Let me-\" Thorin huffs, kneeling between Bilbo's legs and bowing over to kiss Bilbo with a fevered desperation as he struggles to yank his boots off and shove his way out of his pants, which get added to the spread out pile on the floor.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo breaks the kiss to lay back against the bed, but stops short halfway down when he gets an eyefull of all of Thorin. There's muscle and scars, dark hair only accentuating the broad planes of his chest and stomach and helpfully leading Bilbo's eyes down to the very erect, very flushed and thick cock jutting straight out from the black hair.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Oh.\" Bilbo squeaks, mouth falling open a bit and oh gods he shouldn't be staring but he's close to bursting into strained and hysterical giggles because there is so much going on there and it's all leaning over him with a solid strength that leaves Bilbo wondering if this is what it's like being made love to by a solid block of stone come to life. He's reminded of when he used to laugh to himself that Thorin was just too ridiculously attractive to be real, and this is all just confirming that.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Any complaints?\" Thorin grins, moving forward as Bilbo lays back in response, still staring wide eyed as Thorin braces over him and looks him over with a dark, hungry look.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"No. Nono absolutely- definitely not. No complaints. None.\" Bilbo does giggle a little bit at that, reaching out to run a hand over Thorin's broad chest, feeling just slightly giddy. Thorin lowers himself and kisses Bilbo with a slow, deep purpose, running his hands from Bilbo's hips to his shoulders, then back down to sink his fingers into the soft flesh of Bilbo's rear.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Abn\u00e2m'sulum.\" Thorin murmurs again, sucking Bilbo's lip into his mouth and scraping his teeth along the swollen flesh. Any giggling dies quickly with a gasp and soft strangled sound as Thorin settles fully over him again, legs tangled together and kissing Bilbo like it was all he could do.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo hooks his legs around Thorin's hips, the soft cry getting lost in Thorin's mouth when their erections grind together and he's sure he might die from the shocks of heat and friction and wet slide. Thorin's moan is a punch to the gut and the broad hand reaching between them to grasp both of them together is a shock that has Bilbo jerking at the sensation crashing over him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Thorin!\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Fas\u00e2k!\" Thorin wraps his hand firmly around both of them, trapping Bilbo's erection in heat and rough calloused hands against throbbing velvety softness. \"Keep doing that.\" Thorin pants, \"Amral'im'\u00ea, Bilbo, keep saying my name.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin's name is all he can say at this point, it's all he can think. Bilbo breaks the kiss to pant heavily, burying his face into Thorin's shoulder and sinking his fingers into his back. He's distantly aware that he's probably digging his nails into Thorin's skin but right now it's all that's keeping him grounded and steady against the slide and pull of Thorin thrusting against him and breathing harsh, sharp curses and moans into his ear.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo feels like he's being wound tighter and tighter, body shaking and writhing against the everbuilding sensations drowning everything out and leaving him gasping Thorin's name like a mantra to keep him sane. One of his hands lets go of Thorin's back to fling up over his head, scrambling at the fur beneath him and tangling his fingers in it. Thorin shifts his weight, supporting it on his elbow so he can keep the steady pulling with his fist on both of the and clutch at Bilbo's hand at the same time.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Bilbo, amral'm\u00ea. Maigrifi'm\u00ea, Bilbo.\" Thorin's voice catches, breaks down into a deep, rough pant of moaned words and Bilbo can feel the heated coil in him start to break. His nails sink into Thorin's back and he clutches desperately at the hand holding his against the furs, his back arching and breathing in gulping gasps.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Thorin-! Thorin, I-\" And it hits him so hard and fast that he's shocked at the force of it, mouth open and gaping on stopped up air and body jerking suddenly as he releases over himself and Thorin's hand. The sound he makes is a strained, high noise that barely makes it past his lungs and he's still gasping through it when Thorin practically roars in his ear. Bilbo's hand feels like it may break in Thorin's grip and he hardly cares when he feels the hot, wet streaks on his stomach. They shudder and grasp at each other for a few moments, air buzzing and thick as Bilbo tries to get his lungs to start working again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Oh gods and Shire bless...\" Bilbo whimpers, shivering as he crashes back down into himself. Thorin kisses him a bit sloppily, still catching his breath with low, throaty noises and flopping with a heavy thud besides Bilbo. As soon as he's down there's a thick arm reaching out and pulling Bilbo in, pillowing his head on Thorin's bicep.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo slides an arm around Thorin's waist, head tucked up under the dwarfs chin and he feels like he's lit up all over. His muscles are sore and there's a cramp forming in his thigh and he can feel scraped areas of skin from Thorin's beard on his neck and face but really,really could not care a bit right now.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Welcome home.\" Thorin rumbles, and Bilbo laughs a little breathlessly, curled and tucked against Thorin's chest.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"I should leave again, just to come back if that's the welcome I'll get each time.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin's arms tighten around him, stiff and unyielding. \"Don't.\" He says, voice soft and open. \"Not again.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nBilbo nods quickly against his chest, curling his fingers against Thorin's side. \"No. No I won't. Not again. I won't.\" He feels Thorin's sharp, long exhale, and the ruffle of breath as Thorin tucks his face into Bilbo's hair.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Don't be a dream.\" Thorin says, so soft and quiet that Bilbo has the feeling that it's not exactly meant to be heard. He leans away from Thorin's chest, working one hand up in the scant space between them to cup his face and ease him into a slow kiss. Thorin relaxes, sighing into it and following Bilbo's short kiss with a few soft, lingering ones.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"I'm not. I'll be here, I promise. I'll be here in the morning, and the morning after that and so on. I'm back.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nThorin's smile is slow to grow, but so full and painfully vulnerable that Bilbo has to duck down to hide his face against the dwarf's shoulder again. Thorin's arms wrap all around him, and the silence falls over them in the hush of steady breathing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe falls asleep so gradually that he isn't fully aware of it, and as promised, he's there in the morning. And the morning after that, and after that, and so on through the years.\n\n   \n"
