    "text": "Bakugou is having a shitty day even before some no-name villain starts kicking his ass. \nNever one to accept defeat, he rushes to capture the elusive villain, his allies hot on his heels. As soon as they rush into the warehouse, the power cuts, plunging them into darkness. Kirishima lets out a hiss of frustration from somewhere beside him, and Bakugou can sense Deku drawing up short just behind them. Cursing under his breath, Bakugou lifts his hands and sets off a series of small explosions, lightning the space around them in brief flashes of light. \n\u201cHurry up,\u201d he calls behind him to Deku, \u201cShe\u2019s going to get away!\u201d \nHe sees Kirishima\u2019s face contort with frustration, warped by the flashing lights. \u201cWe need a plan,\u201d he says.\nBakugou scoffs. \u201cHere\u2019s my plan.\u201d He lifts his hands upwards and lets off a bigger explosion, letting it illuminate the entire space of the warehouse and controlling the accompanying smoke. He catches movement in the far corner of the room, and runs towards it without bothering to see if Deku and Kirishima are following. \n\u201cKacchan,\u201d Deku calls out, but Bakugou ignores him. \nHe remembers enough of the layout from the moment of illumination to duck around boxes and support beams, listening to the echoes of his steps. \n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he growls under his breath. \u201cWhere are you\u2014\u201d\nLaughter echoes around him. It seems to come from multiple directions at once, and Bakugou freezes, turning his head this way and that and trying to follow the noise. As though seeing his frustration, the laughter grows louder and richer. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, little hero?\u201d A cool, feminine voice asks. \nBakugou lets out a hiss from between his teeth, then lifts his hands again and detonates. Hopefully, the stragglers will see it and know where he is\u2014otherwise, he\u2019ll take care of this himself. \nIn the brief moment of illumination, he sees her just behind him. Her long, dark hair is held away from her face, and she wears a Venetian half-mask over her eyes. Her costume is black and white, lace and loose sleeves. She looks like she\u2019s pieced it together from a dozen different countries and time periods\u2014a European corset over a traditional kimono cut short, lace-up boots and that mask. \nBakugou turns as quickly as he can, lunging towards her.\nShe laughs, cool and unaffected. Then she vanishes from before his eyes. \n\u201cToo slow, hero,\u201d she says, voice now somewhere far above him. \u201cI think that\u2019s your problem, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\u201cFuck you!\u201d Bakugou screeches, pivoting again and trying to follow the sound of her movements.\n\u201cKacchan!\u201d Deku runs up beside him, the power of his borrowed Quirk running down his limbs like currents of green electricity. It\u2019s enough to show Bakugou where he is, without giving off enough light to actually be helpful. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d \n\u201cShe teleported, again,\u201d Bakugou grunts out. He hears it when Kirishima joins them, but he doesn\u2019t acknowledge the other\u2019s presence. \n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she just get away, entirely?\u201d Kirishima asks. \u201cWhy stay in here at all?\u201d \nBakugou turns back to Deku. \u201cOne of us needs to pin her down while the other one knocks her out. We need to corner her.\u201d \n\u201cAll right,\u201d Deku agrees. \u201cAre you okay? Your movements are off, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut the fuck up, Deku.\u201d Bakugou turns away. \u201cI can light this place up, then you lunge at her as soon as you see her. Got it?\u201d \n\u201cI can hold her down,\u201d Kirishima says, like that\u2019s obvious. And maybe it is, since breaking through his hold when he\u2019s unbreakable is nearly impossible. Bakugou knows\u2014he\u2019s tried. \n\u201cFine,\u201d Bakugou grunts out, still not facing Kirishima. \u201cDeku, you grab him and take him with you.\u201d \nThe three of them nod, though Kirishima casts Bakugou a reproachful look. He crosses his arms over his chest and stares at Bakugou, not looking away as Bakugou\u2019s small explosions spark in and out of existence. \nBakugou clicks his tongue against his teeth and turns away. \n\u201cReady?\u201d he grunts. \nDeku looks between Kirishima and Bakugou, then bites down on the inside of his cheek and shakes his head. \u201cReady. Come on, Riot.\u201d \nKirishima swallows a sigh, then steps towards Deku and grips him around the waist, preparing to be propelled into the air when Deku kicks off from the ground. Seeing them both secured, Bakugou lifts his hands and feels the sweat pooling against his palms. \n\u201cGo!\u201d he screams, as he lets off his biggest explosion yet. The light is blinding for a moment, but then he hears the impact as Deku kicks off and takes Kirishima with him. A dark blur is moving in the furthest corner of the room, and Deku torpedoes towards her, surrounded by the light of his Quirk. \nBakugou concentrates the power of his Quirk, preparing to launch himself into the air to follow. But then, he hears a laugh lilting like bell chimes behind him.\n\u201cThat actually might have worked, if I was anyone else,\u201d she says, as Bakugou pivots on his heel to face her.\nShe tosses her long tail of dark hair over one shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re all still students, aren\u2019t you? It shows.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d Bakugou screams, pushing forward and catching her around the waist. She laughs as they hit a wall, Bakugou trying to pin her down. \n\u201cTime isn\u2019t on your side, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she says. Then she disappears from under him and reappears a few feet away. \nFuck. Now Deku and Kirishima are on the other side of the warehouse, and Bakugou is alone with her. But it\u2019s not as if he needs their help\u2014he\u2019s going to finish this. \nHe kicks off with the force of an explosion and reaches for her, only to have her slip through his fingers again and reappear just beyond his reach as he hits the ground. She\u2019d teleported across the entire warehouse a moment ago, but now she\u2019s staying within the space of a few feet. Is this a limitation of her Quirk? Can he exploit it? \nShe\u2019s laughing, again. Bakugou grits his teeth and imagines blowing her to pieces. \nThen, she appears behind him and swings a kick in his direction, catching him in the back and sending him sprawling.\n\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d he bites out, as he tastes bile rushing up his throat. \n\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be this disappointing,\u201d she says, almost whining. \u201cAfter all the stories I\u2019ve heard, this is it?\u201d\nWhat fucking stories, Bakugou wants to ask. He\u2019s been on the news often enough, but not for any particularly heroic exploits. Even now, almost a full year into Yuuei, he hasn\u2019t measured up in the way he\u2019d initially anticipated. He\u2019s behind, having been the last person in his class to achieve a provisional license. He\u2019s partnered with Deku and Kirishima right now because they\u2019re the ones with the experience, not him. So, what the hell is this fucker going on about? \nHe hears her laugh again, and has to hold himself back from chasing the sound. He steps back, shuts his eyes, and listens. When he senses movement heading towards him, he reaches out and detonates. \nShe grunts in surprise, and in the fading light of the explosion he sees her tumbling backwards. Bakugou follows, determined to end this. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t beat me,\u201d he growls, blowing her back again before she can get her feet under her and teleport again. \nShe smiles wanly, lips curling beneath the line of her mask. \u201cHow disappointing.\u201d \nHe hears pounding footsteps coming towards him, and knows it\u2019s Kirishima. He\u2019d know the rhythm of those steps anywhere, the weight of them. He swallows convulsively and turns back to his opponent. \n\u201cAh,\u201d she says knowingly. \u201cDistracted.\u201d \n\u201cDie.\u201d He detonates again, but she\u2019s laughing, teleporting just a few feet away to avoid the explosion. \nHe pivots, trying to find her, but then she reappears right in front of him. Before he can block, she reaches out and places her hand over his face, sending him staggering back. \n\u201cAsshole,\u201d he hisses. \u201cGet the fuck off me!\u201d \nBut then he\u2019s struck by a feeling of displacement. All at once, he\u2019s falling. She\u2019s teleported them both upwards, into the air, and now she\u2019s still holding onto them as they tumble towards the ground. \n\u201cKacchan!\u201d \nShe gets a hand over his face, again, and Bakugou rears back and screams as he feels the sensation of fire crawling over his face. \n\u201cYou\u2019re annoying me,\u201d she says, as they fall. \u201cYou need to be taught a lesson.\u201d \nThe pain is so intense that he can\u2019t think past it. He knows he should get his arms behind him, let off an explosion to keep them from hitting the ground straight on. But he can\u2019t move, he feels like he\u2019s being disassembled atom by atom. \n\u201cKatsuki!\u201d \nOh, that voice. That\u2019s something he can always focus on, even though he\u2019s been trying not to, all day. Because the last time they\u2019d spoken, just a few hours ago, Kirishima had said\u2014\n\u2014\nHis face is hot and flushed, his muscles loose and sluggish. He floats just outside of awareness, struggling to figure out where he is. He\u2019s lying face-down, his stomach bare against soft sheets. He\u2019s in a bed, but it doesn\u2019t feel like his dorm on Yuuei\u2019s campus, or his bedroom in his parents\u2019 house. Where the fuck is he? \n\u201cI\u2019m going to shower first,\u201d someone says, their voice far away. \u201cGet some more sleep, okay?\u201d \nHe doesn\u2019t know who\u2019s speaking to him, but more sleep sounds heavenly. Bakugou sinks down against the sheets, grunting out something like an affirmative. \nFootsteps pad away, and then Bakugou hears a door open and shut. \nFive minutes later, he realizes the intense oddity of that exchange, and shoots upright in bed. The sheets fall away from him, and he groans as a headache blooms into existence at the base of his skull.\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d he groans, trying to push through the fog around his thoughts. Slowly, the room around him comes into focus. \nIt\u2019s a bedroom, with light streaming in from a wide window that takes up most of one wall. There\u2019s a serviceable dresser across from him, a mirror hung above it, and shelving around the walls that hold books, photographs, and other detritus of a life. There\u2019s a closet on one side of the room, and then two doors opposite it, one of which presumably leads to a bathroom. \nBakugou clutches his head in his hands, trying to focus. The bed he\u2019s sitting in is king-sized, made of the same dark wood as the dresser and covered in steel-gray sheets. Bakugou\u2019s wearing only boxers, and had been lying on one side of the mattress. He looks over and sees sheets curled around an empty space, as though there\u2019d been someone sleeping beside him. \nIt\u2019s at that moment that Bakugou realizes something is very, very wrong. He glances down at himself and sees scars he\u2019s never had before along his arms, little nicks and scratches he\u2019d never have been oblivious to. When he reaches up, his limbs feel longer, and as he staggers to his feet he stands several centimeters taller than he had, last thing he knew. He glances at the mirror, catches sight of his reflection, and screams. \nOne of the doors on the opposite side of the room bursts open, steam spilling out into the bedroom. A man crosses the room in quick strides, looking around for some enemy he can\u2019t yet see. \nNo, not just a man. Kirishima. His Quirk is fulling activated, his hair sticking behind him in stiff spikes and his arms gnarled and held before him like weapons. He\u2019s completely naked, hardened down to the tips of his toes, and as he rushes forward he catches sight of Bakugou.\n\u201cKatsuki,\u201d he yells out, before coming up next to him. \u201cWhat happened, are you okay?\u201d \nKatsuki, Bakugou thinks dumbly. When the fuck did he give Kirishima permission to use his given name? \nKirishima is still looking at him with concern, evident even through the way his Quirk warps his expressions to look like they\u2019re carved from wood. Then, he lets his Quirk deactivate, standing before Bakugou with dripping hair and water running down his naked body. And just like Bakugou, he\u2019s changed. He\u2019s taller, his shoulders broader and his chest almost perfectly built. There are white scars lining his tanned skin, and his red hair, weighed down by water, falls past his shoulders. But it\u2019s face that\u2019s the most startling\u2014there\u2019s no more baby fat rounding his cheeks, his jawline sharp and his eyes shadowed with age. He\u2019s older\u2014he\u2019s old. He\u2019s not the Kirishima that Bakugou knows. \n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Bakugou screeches, rearing away from him. Explosions spark from his hands as he tries to put space between them. \u201cWhat the hell are you, get the fuck away from me, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \n\u201cKatsuki,\u201d Kirishima says again, grabbing him by the shoulders, shaking him slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s me, babe. What is it? A nightmare?\u201d He lifts his hands to Bakugou\u2019s face, his thumbs rubbing gentle circles against his cheeks. \nBakugou is so shocked that, for a moment, he forgets to be angry. He freezes in his tracks, as Kirishima continues to touch him more gently than anyone\u2019s ever touched him, before. His thumbs are rough and calloused, but he touches Bakugou as if he has a right to, as if he\u2019s done this before. \n\u201cI\u2014what?\u201d Bakugou croaks out. This can\u2019t be real. He pushes Kirishima away. \u201cWhat is this? What did you do to me?\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Kirishima is still saying, his voice low and soothing. \u201cCome back to me, okay?\u201d\nIn combat situations, Bakugou thinks, it\u2019s best to stay calm and analyze the situation before acting. He hears the thought in Aizawa\u2019s voice. And if anything would be useful, right now, it would be the man\u2019s enduring and infuriating calm. He needs to figure out what\u2019s going on, and screaming his head off might not be the way to get himself out of this. \nHe takes a deep breath, tries to steel himself. He glances up at Kirishima, who looks back with concern in his red eyes. Belatedly, and inconveniently, Bakugou realizes that the years have treated Kirishima well. He\u2019s always been handsome, his expressions eager and inviting and warm. But now, hardened by age, he\u2019s\u2026 something else entirely. Bakugou swallows. \n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Kirishima asks. \u201cBreathe with me, okay?\u201d\nHe sucks in a deep breath, and Bakugou follows along instinctively. Kirishima\u2019s fingers are running through his hair, soft and soothing. It\u2019s then that Bakugou realizes what must have happened.\nThis is an illusion. The villain they\u2019d been chasing\u2014she\u2019s trapped him here, somehow. And now Bakugou has to find his way out. \nOn the bedside table, an alarm goes off, the muscled arms on either side of it flexing as the bell sounds. \n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Kirishima says, pulling away from Bakugou. He slams down on the alarm clock and then sits down on the bed, still dripping. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get ready for work.\u201d\nBakugou nods dumbly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay, now?\u201d Kirishima asks again, eyes wide with concern. And in that moment, he looks just like his younger self, so open and earnest and stupidly sincere. \nBakugou blinks his eyes closed, then growls out, \u201cOf course I am, shitty hair.\u201d \nKirishima laughs, his voice just like Bakugou remembers it. \nWork. Of course, they have work\u2014they look about thirty fucking years old. \nBakugou staggers over to the closet, finding a bunch of loose jeans on hangers that must be his. When he pulls out a pair, Kirishima calls out to him. \n\u201cUm, Katsuki? You\u2019re not going to wear your costume?\u201d \nWork. Of course. He\u2019s a pro hero. Even if this is just an illusion, that stupid villain knew better than to pull him away from his inevitable future. He looks further into the closet and sees his costume\u2014similar enough to the version he\u2019d worn as a teenager to be recognizable, but more streamlined, more elegant in some ways. He reaches and pulls it out of the closet, seeing the ID badge hung around the neck of the hanger.\nHe\u2019s familiar with Yuuei\u2019s IDs, having carried one since he entered the school almost a year ago\u2014at least, a year ago by his own time and not the time of this illusion. But now when he looks down, he sees his older self staring back at him. Like Kirishima, his face has thinned out, his hair styled slightly differently. But it\u2019s unmistakably him. \nBakugou Katsuki, the ID reads. Faculty. \n\u201cNo fucking way,\u201d he says, scrutinizing the ID. Why the hell would he be wasting his time stuck at Yuuei when he could be out on the streets, earning himself a reputation as the best hero in the world? What the fuck is wrong with this version of himself? \n\u201cAw, babe,\u201d Kirishima says, coming up behind him. \u201cYou promised you\u2019d smile in your ID photo this year.\u201d \nThis year, as though there\u2019ve been many in the past. \n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Bakugou says, by reflex. \n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Kirishima agrees easily. \u201cBut I still asked.\u201d \n\u201cThen you\u2019re an idiot.\u201d \nKirishima pokes him in the side. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay? You\u2019re mean, today.\u201d \nBakugou crosses his arms over his chest and steps away from Kirishima. \u201cOf course, I am. Fuck off.\u201d \n\u201cOkay,\u201d he says easily. \u201cGet dressed, okay? I\u2019m going to go rinse off all this soap.\u201d He leans down and presses a kiss to Bakugou\u2019s cheek, then disappears back into the bathroom.\nWhat the fuck. Bakugou\u2019s vision goes white, the feeling of Kirishima\u2019s lips against his skin burning like a firebrand. This is, perhaps, something he should have realized before this. Kirishima touched him so easily, was so comfortably naked in front of him, and had slept in the same bed. But Bakugou hadn\u2019t stopped to think about what that would mean, before now. \nHe glances at himself in the mirror, and sees the leather cord hanging around his neck. He reaches up to run his fingers over it, following it down to the small ring hanging from it. He can\u2019t see it properly from this angle, so he pulls the cord off his neck and looks down at the ring more closely.\nIt\u2019s gold, a plain band embellished by a single ruby. On the inside of the band a date is engraved, followed by the words It had to be you. \nBakugou\u2019s older self, who sleeps in the same bed as Kirishima, wears a wedding ring around his neck. \nHe thinks of the villain he\u2019d been chasing, of her lilting laughter and mocking comments. \n\u201cThat. Fucking. Bitch.\u201d \n\u2014\nIt\u2019s instinctive, getting to Yuuei. Bakugou, dressed in his uniform with the ring back around his neck, hidden under his shirt, gets to the main building five minutes before homeroom usually starts. It isn\u2019t until he wanders through the hallways and ends up in front of the door to classroom 1A that he realizes he doesn\u2019t know where he\u2019s actually supposed to be. This had just been muscle memory, going towards the place he\u2019s spent the most time in, following the same route he\u2019s taken every day for a year. \nHe stands outside the door, frozen. If this is an illusion, will he just be forced to play out whatever reality that villain had created for him? \n\u201cUm, Bakugou-sensei?\u201d A voice sounds from behind him. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to go inside?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a student standing next to him, dressed in Yuuei\u2019s uniform and sipping at a cup of bubble tea through a straw. She\u2019s small, even for a first year, and has bubble-gum pink hair in two curling tails on either side of her head. \n\u201cAren\u2019t you fucking late?\u201d Bakugou retorts.\n\u201cI was getting tea,\u201d she says, as though it\u2019s obvious. \u201cYou\u2019re the one standing outside the door like a weirdo, sensei.\u201d She skips by him to the door, entering the classroom. \nWell. At least that tells Bakugou that he\u2019s in the right place. \nAs he steps inside, he\u2019s met by the kind of cacophony only twenty teenagers can make. There\u2019s so much movement, color and sound that he can\u2019t process for a moment. Instead, he trudges towards the spot in front of the classroom that he\u2019s used to Aizawa occupying. \nThe girl with the pink twintails is sitting in the front row. She catches Bakugou\u2019s eye and raises her brows, like she\u2019s expecting him to do something. \nNow he knows this shit life is an illusion. No one blinks an eye at him being in the classroom, and that brat had called him sensei. He can\u2019t imagine a reality in which he would grow up to this. \n\u201cSensei?\u201d Twintails asks again. \u201cClass?\u201d \nHe stares out at the classroom as the students shift into their seats. There are four rows of five of them, the same layout he\u2019s familiar with. But he\u2019s never stood on this side of it. He doesn\u2019t know what to do. \nAfter a minute, another student speaks up after raising his hand. He has bright orange hair and wears his uniform loosely, slouching slightly in his chair. \u201cYo, sensei. If we\u2019re not having class, can you tell us another battle story?\u201d \nAnother, Bakugou thinks dimly. Has he ever told anyone a story in his life? \n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d Another girl calls out. Her curling black hair is held back from her face, and she reminds Bakugou of Yaoyorozu in the way she sits primly at her desk. \u201cTell us a story about Deku, sensei!\u201d \n\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Bakugou hisses, finally finding his voice. \u201cWhy would you want to hear stories about him?\u201d\nTwintails rolls her eyes. \u201cBecause they\u2019re all boring, and only want to hear stories about the Number One Hero.\u201d \nShe says this as though it\u2019s an established fact, and no one contradicts her. Deku. The Number One Hero. Even knowing his connection to All Might, even knowing about his Quirk, Bakugou can\u2019t swallow that fact. If Deku is number one, what does that make him? \nNot number one. Something lesser, inferior. \nIt\u2019s as though there\u2019s something living inside of him, clawing at his chest and curling around his heart. For a moment, he can\u2019t breathe. Then, Bakugou bites down furiously on his tongue, forcing himself to focus.\n\u201cTell us about a time you worked together, then,\u201d Orange Hair says. \u201cWhat about that battle from two years ago? You never told us about that one!\u201d\nThe crowd dissolves into chaos as the rest of the students join in, demanding the same story. Bakugou, who has no fucking idea what happened two years ago, doesn\u2019t know what to tell them. But he does know that they\u2019re all giving him a goddamn headache. \n\u201cShut up,\u201d he yells, and immediately the classroom goes quiet. Bakugou frowns, then his eyes fix on the prim girl. \u201cYou\u2014Curly Hair. You\u2019re the class rep, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nIt had just been a guess, but the girl nods. \u201cMy name is Sato, sensei. I thought you\u2019d finally learned our names.\u201d \n\u201cWhy would I bother doing that?\u201d Bakugou asks, and half the class groans while the other half laughs. \u201cWhatever. You keep track of the lesson plan, don\u2019t you? What are we supposed to be doing, today?\u201d \nSato pulls out a notebook and rattles off page numbers and subject matter. Bakugou breathes a sigh of relief\u2014it\u2019s math. There\u2019s no way math has changed, even if he\u2019s been pushed into an illusion world in the future. Thank fuck he\u2019s mostly done with first year, now, and can fake his way through their lessons. \nHe pulls out a textbook and starts talking through the concepts, and the class more or less settles down. As he explains the lesson and assigns the work, they watch him diligently. One kid has green skin and hair and seems to grow different animal ears depending on closely he\u2019s paying attention. Another has a wild mess of red, black and yellow hair, and shuffles cards in front of him as he completely zones out. Twintails, in the first row, looks away from the board but is definitely taking quiet notes. \nFifty minutes later, the classroom door opens.\n\u201cOh\u2014Bakugou-san. I thought you\u2019d be done, by now.\u201d \nHe looks up, startled. He hadn\u2019t even realized how quickly time was going by.\nHe blinks at her. She\u2019s probably almost as tall as he is, maybe even taller. Her black hair is held back in a familiar, flippy ponytail. Her costume is deep red, a cropped shirt that bares her midriff and short pants that cut off before her ankles. A thick belt drapes at an angle at her waist. \n\u201cObviously not, Ponytail,\u201d he grouses at her.\nYaoyorozu sighs, then smiles at the class. \u201cTime for Chemistry.\u201d \nBakugou brushes past her and exits the room, not bothering to erase the mess of instructions and examples he\u2019s left on the board.\n--\nThe staffroom is blessedly empty when Bakugou gets there. He\u2019s followed Aizawa here enough times to know where it is, and logically, now, it should be his haven. It hasn\u2019t changed much in the years since he\u2019d been a student\u2014 that is, assuming those years have actually passed. This could be some kind of illusion created from his own memories, and in that case, it only makes sense that most things are still familiar to him.\nAt the end of a row of uniform desks is one with a nameplate with his own name printed on it. Bakugou heads towards it and slouches into the swivel chair, peeling off his gloves and gauntlets and massaging his wrists. The gauntlets are much more streamlined than they had been\u2014 small and compact, fitting just around his wrists. He wonders if they still offer the same protections and enhancements as the ones he normally uses. His gloves, too, are thinner. Maybe this is just the version of his costume he wears for teaching? \nBakugou sits leaning forward, tension keeping his body wound tight. At his desk sits a high-tech computer, an empty coffee mug, and a series of framed pictures. The pictures seem quaint, compared to the relative technology of this world. He glances at them and startles. \nIn the first, he\u2019s only a year or two older than he should be\u2014 maybe seventeen, eighteen years old. He looks much the same, even though he\u2019s a little taller. His parents stand to one side of him, and on the other is All Might, weakened and frail as he\u2019s been since Kamino Ward. Bakugou swallows down the bitter taste of guilt, looking at him, and wonders if this future version of himself tastes the same every time he looks at the picture. It\u2019s then that Bakugou notices the curled-up diploma he\u2019s holding in the picture, and realizes this must be his graduation from Yuuei. All Might has an arm around his shoulders, and is smiling widely, with pride in his sunken eyes. The Bakugou in the picture is smirking, but there\u2019s also an indent in the side of his face. That means he\u2019s biting down on the inside of his cheek, trying to keep his expression in check. Bakugou scoffs at his younger self. \nThe next picture looks like it was clipped out of a newspaper. The headline is missing, but two heroes, standing out starkly against a background of destruction, are surging forward with fists outstretched. Even though they\u2019re older, even though they\u2019re seen from behind, Bakugou recognizes them immediately\u2014 himself, and Deku. Standing on the same side. Taking on some enemy together. He quickly moves on from that picture, too, unwilling to interrogate it too closely. The creature living in his stomach and clawing its way through him writhes, and Bakugou swallows down his worst emotions. \nFinally, there\u2019s a picture of Kirishima. He isn\u2019t facing the camera, and his eyes are closed as he throws back his head and laughs. His skin is sun-warmed, and he looks relaxed and happy. Without a doubt, Bakugou knows this picture was taken at some intimate moment, a candid. Did Bakugou take this picture himself? And if so, does that mean Kirishima is that happy, being around him? \nHe glances at the coffee mug, again. It\u2019s bright orange, and printed across it in clumsy English are the words \u201cWorld\u2019s Blastiest Husband.\u201d \n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Bakugou mutters, running his hands through his hair. Nothing about this place makes any sense. None of this was his ambition\u2014 he wants to be better than Deku, not standing by his side. He wants to be a hero, not a teacher stuck at Yuuei for the rest of his goddamn life. He wants to be independent, he never wants to need anyone, and yet this version of himself is fucking married? And to Kirishima, of all people? \n\u201cI know this isn\u2019t real!\u201d He shouts, at the world in general, at no one in particular. \u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing, hah? Do you think you can drive me crazy with this, or trap me here forever? I\u2019m not some shitty lightweight. I know this isn\u2019t real! So, cut the shit and let me out of here! Face me!\u201d \nHis screams are met with no response. Bakugou considers, briefly, just blowing things up until the illusion starts coming apart at its seams. But his power is a physical one, and whatever is happening to him is in his head. That won\u2019t work. \nIt\u2019s a war he has often, his visceral and physical desires for action battling with the more logical part of his brain. This time, logic wins out. \nBakugou rests his elbows against the desk, and his chin against his hands. He stares at the photographs for a long time. \nLater, the door to the staffroom opens. \u201cOh, Bakugou-san. Would you like to eat lunch together?\u201d\nBakugou looks up and squints at Yaoyorozu. It makes sense that she would end up at Yuuei\u2014 she was always too eager to help out their classmates, and was basically already a second teacher. She probably feels more comfortable in the classroom than out in the midst of a battle, even still. It makes sense that she\u2019d have that sort of weakness, not him. So why the hell is he here? \nBut then he gets a better read on Yaoyorozu\u2019s face. She isn\u2019t asking him to have lunch out of any sort of kindness\u2014 there\u2019s a shrewdness in her expression that has Bakugou wondering what she wants. \n\u201cFine,\u201d he says, pulling himself to his feet. \nThe staff, as it turns out, have their own lunchroom, also catered by Lunch Rush. Bakugou and Yaoyorozu help themselves to their meals\u2014 Yaoyorozu loading her tray with enough for two people, to feed her Quirk\u2014 and then they sit in a table in the back of the room. It\u2019s early enough that no one else has shown up in the lunchroom, yet. \n\u201cThe students said you were a bit off this morning,\u201d Yaoyorozu says, apropos of nothing. She sips delicately at her miso soup. \n\u201cWhat the hell would they know about it?\u201d Bakugou snaps. \nYaoyorozu sets her bowl to one side. \u201cI think they can read you pretty well by now. I just thought I\u2019d ask, in case you wanted to talk about it. Or in case there\u2019s something I need to be worried about.\u201d \nBakugou bites down on his tongue. He doesn\u2019t like Yaoyorozu. Her entire demeanor is condescending, and she consistently scores higher than him on exams, which rankles his pride. He knows that people like her, and Todoroki, and Iida, think they\u2019re better than him. It shows through in how they talk, how much experience they have around pro-heroes, how many privileges they\u2019ve been afforded throughout their lives. \nBut if this is an illusion, why choose Yaoyorozu to populate it? He doesn\u2019t even have that many distinct memories of her. She\u2019s not a member of Class 1A who\u2019s been on the news as often as Deku or Kirishima or Uraraka or Todoroki. So why her? \n\u201cSome days I just wonder why the fuck I\u2019m here,\u201d Bakugou grits out, because he doesn\u2019t know what else to say. \nYaoyorozu clicks her tongue against the back of her teeth, and it takes Bakugou a minute to realize she\u2019s stifling a laugh.\n\u201cWhat? What the fuck are you giggling at, Ponytail?\u201d \n\u201cMy apologies,\u201d Yaoyorozu says, even though she doesn\u2019t sound sorry at all. \u201cIt\u2019s just, it seems odd to me that you\u2019d say that, given how adamant you were about being here in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cHah?\u201d\nYaoyorozu shrugs delicately. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? It was about three years ago, when Aizawa-sensei moved up to principal. And you heard about it, and since he wouldn\u2019t actively be in the classrooms anymore, you said, \u2018I don\u2019t fucking trust anyone else to keep those kids safe, so I\u2019m going to have to do it myself.\u2019\u201d \nBakugou blinks at her. \u201cDid you just fucking curse at me?\u201d\nYaoyorozu lifts her chin. \u201cIt was for the accuracy of the quote, Bakugou-san.\u201d \nNow, Bakugou thinks over her words, and feels as though someone\u2019s just walked over his grave. Does that mean, in this time, that Yuuei students are in as much danger as they\u2019d been in when he was a student? Of course, it\u2019s a reality that Bakugou can\u2019t get away from, in his own present. He\u2019d been the singular target of the largest villain attack, and his own classmates had been injured as a result. Yaoyorozu had been one of them. And the villains had managed to take him, in the end. \nWho else would be good enough to protect the next generation of heroes? \nBakugou grinds his teeth and stabs at his lunch with his chopsticks. \u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d\nYaoyorozu smiles at him, too kindly. \u201cBut on most days, I think you enjoy teaching more than you\u2019re willing to admit. Are you just having a bad day, today?\u201d\n\u201cAll my days are fucking fantastic,\u201d he seethes. \nShe nods sagely. \u201cOf course.\u201d \nThey lapse into a somewhat comfortable silence, after that, each attending to their own meal. Bakugou decides that if Yaoyorozu grows up into someone who knows how to shut up, then maybe she gets better over time. Just a little. \n\u201cBy the way,\u201d she says, interrupting Bakugou\u2019s thoughts, \u201cHave you finalized all the plans for tomorrow night? I know yesterday you were supposed to pick some things up, but your patrol ran long\u2014\u201d\nHer words are cut off by a high-pitched chirp that must have been specifically designed to annoy Bakugou. He whips around, searching for the source of the noise, but finds nothing. Then, the chirp sounds again, and this time he realizes it\u2019s coming from his person.\n\u201cWhat the hell is that,\u201d he growls, patting down his pockets. \nYaoyorozu arches an eyebrow at him, trying to bite down on a smile. \u201cDid Kirishima-san change your ringtone without your permission, again?\u201d \nHe\u2019s about to deny it, before he realizes that\u2019s exactly the kind of shit that Kirishima would pull. Even in his time, when they\u2019re nothing more than\u2014 well, whatever the fuck they are, to each other\u2014 that shitty-haired bastard takes too many liberties. He\u2019s always on Bakugou to answer his phone more, to respond to the seven group chats he\u2019s been added to (one with Kirishima and Kaminari; one with Kirishima, Kaminari, and Sero; one with the three of them and Ashido; and on, and on), and to generally be more engaged. It\u2019s infuriating. It only stands to reason that he\u2019s gotten pushier over time, and would reprogram Bakugou\u2019s cellphone to annoy him into answering it.\n\u201cI\u2019ll kill him.\u201d Bakugou finally finds the source of the noise, a slim piece of orange, metallic fiberglass made up of two cylinders hooked together. It doesn\u2019t look like any phone he\u2019s ever seen, but his body knows what to do\u2014 he places his thumbs and forefingers on the edges of the cylinders and pulls them apart, revealing a digital screen between them. On its display, a new message flashes at him.\n\nJK (12:15): Hey, I\u2019ve got the music all set for tomorrow. What time did you want me to set up?\n\nBakugou stares down at the message, utterly unable to decipher it. He flicks at the screen with one finger, revealing a string of unread texts.\n\nUO (11:10): I\u2019m going to come by around 5:30, tomorrow! Please let me in this time, I won\u2019t be able to call Kirishima-kun for a key! Remember, I\u2019m doing this for *you*!\n\n\nKD (10:15): I know you\u2019re not supposed to come in, today, but there\u2019re some paperwork we need our Head Hero to take care of. And yes, I mean that very mockingly! Stop by around 4, okay?\n\n\nKE (9:05): You rushed out of the house pretty quick, this morning. Are you sure you\u2019re okay? If you need to talk tonight\u2014 If you want to talk tonight. I\u2019ll be home.\n\nBakugou keeps staring. He can vaguely make sense of the messages, but at the same time he realizes they aren\u2019t meant for him. At least, not him the way he is now. These people are talking to a Bakugou who has lived an entirely different life. He doesn\u2019t belong here. \nHe runs a hand over his face and looks up at Yaoyorozu. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on tomorrow, then?\u201d he asks roughly, trying to reign in his tone. It barely works.\nShe looks at him with concern in her dark eyes. \u201cBakugou-san,\u201d she says, huffing out a nervous laugh. \u201cYou can\u2019t have forgotten.\u201d \n\u201cWhy would I ask, then?\u201d \nShe shakes her head, ponytail bobbing. \u201cThe party, Bakugou-san. For your\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAre you two seriously having lunch without us? I expect this kind of Class A elitism from Bakugou, but not you, Yaoyorozu.\u201d \nBakugou doesn\u2019t even need to turn around to know who\u2019s entered the lunch room behind him. He does so, anyway, because he doesn\u2019t really want to believe it. \nBut sure enough, there stands Monoma Neito in his fucking orchestra conductor\u2019s costume, white gloves and all. He looks fresher than Kirishima and Bakugou do, his face not visibly scarred or roughly aged, and his body too covered to tell if his wounds lie elsewhere. When he catches Bakugou\u2019s eye, he lifts both his brows and smirks, the same as always. \nYaoyorozu purses her lips, then shrugs. \u201cCan\u2019t two old friends want to have a private conversation, Monoma-san?\u201d \n\u201cSure,\u201d another voice says, \u201cBut some warning would be nice.\u201d This newcomer is dressed in a deep teal dress, with a high collar and no sleeves. The half-mask that she usually wears around her eyes is draped around her neck. Her long, orange-red hair is pulled back in a ponytail.\nAnother of the 1B kids, Bakugou\u2019s brain supplies. Kendou? \nAnd then, just behind her, dressed in sleek black and purple, is a man with a gaunt face and hair that sticks out from his head like tendrils of smoke and shadow. Bakugou recognizes him from his fight with Deku, months ago\u2014 Shinsou Hitoshi. The mind-controller. \n\u201cYou can join us, now, if you\u2019d like,\u201d Yaoyorozu cuts in smoothly. \nAnd then, as though this is something they do every day, the three of them pull up chairs and bring their own lunches over to the tables. They chatter about their individual classes\u2014 Monoma and Kendou are in charge of the second heroics class, and Shinsou manages a program that pulls promising students out of the other departments and helps them catch up and transfer to heroics. \nThe longer Bakugou sits amongst them, the more his skin begins to crawl. This isn\u2019t right. This isn\u2019t the life he wants. He\u2019d rather die than be stuck here day in and day out, pretending. Because surely no version of him, no matter how old, can live this life naturally. \nAt some point in the conversation, Monoma elbows Bakugou in the side. \u201cYou\u2019re being awfully quiet,\u201d he says tauntingly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you today, then?\u201d \nBakugou can see Yaoyorozu\u2019s signals for Monoma to shut up, even though she\u2019s trying to be subtle. He rolls his eyes and feels himself smile as he reaches out and shoves Monoma off his chair and onto the floor. \n\u2014\nAfter lunch, getting through his afternoon classes is almost easy. Now that he has his cellphone, he\u2019s got his own notes on his schedule, as well as the updates that come from Principal Aizawa about what he\u2019s supposed to discuss with his homeroom at the end of the day. \nStill, Bakugou is exhausted by the time the day is over. He\u2019d rather spend twice that time patrolling, or fighting the toughest battles of his life. At least villains don\u2019t keep asking stupid questions, like a classroom full of teenagers does.\nAs he\u2019s leaving Yuuei\u2019s campus, a new message pops up on his phone.\n\nKD (4:05): Just got back from patrol with Riot. You coming or not?\n\nBakugou has no idea where he\u2019s supposed to go, but his phone seems to know best. It gives him a list of places he and this number frequent, the first being a building not far away from Yuuei. \nBakugou follows the map and gets there within fifteen minutes. The building is sleek and modern, and it reminds him enough of Best Jeanist\u2019s offices that he recognizes it for what it is\u2014 a hero agency. \nThe doors immediately slide open for him, and the young man at the front desk smiles brightly. \u201cBakugou-san,\u201d he calls out. \u201cI thought today was your day off?\u201d \nA stupid thing to say to a person who has literally spent all day at work, but Bakugou lets it slide. \u201cWhere\u2019s Riot?\u201d he asks, since this person seems to know him and isn\u2019t questioning his presence. He must have gotten the right place. \n\u201cUpstairs, the fifth-floor offices, I think,\u201d the man says. \u201cHe and Kaminari-san just got back, I don\u2019t think they had any injuries to deal with.\u201d\nBakugou bites the inside of his cheek as he stalks off towards the elevators. Of course, injuries come with the territory of being pro heroes. But if he, Kaminari and Kirishima are all working together, they better not be the type of pathetic fucks who get injured on every routine patrol. \nHe crosses his arms over his chest as the elevator takes him upstairs. The decor of the hero agency is not exactly what he would\u2019ve imagined\u2014 it\u2019s dominated by red and black, with metallic steel fixtures and lots of glass and light. It\u2019s exactly the kind of place that would crumple immediately if Bakugou let off the wrong explosion or Kirishima punched the wall in his hardened form. \nHe hears them before he sees them, rancorous laughter coming from one of the offices as soon as he steps out onto the fifth floor. Shaking his head, Bakugou follows the noise and tries not to think about how this is familiar, even to him. After all, how many times has he headed down the hall, back to his dorm room, only to hear Kirishima and Kaminari\u2019s laughter coming from the room next door? Lately, it\u2019s even been easy to stop in and join them with less and less pretenses. Or at least, it had been heading that way before today.\nKirishima is sitting on what must be his desk, still in his hero costume. It hasn\u2019t changed much, in essentials\u2014 he\u2019s wearing the long black sleeves he\u2019d adopted in their first year, and his chest is bare. But Bakugou is fixated on something he hadn\u2019t noticed this morning\u2014 the white skin at the center of Kirishima\u2019s chest, shaped like a starburst. It\u2019s a scar, a massive one, like something had gone straight through Kirishima. \n\u201cKatsuki,\u201d Kirishima calls out, still laughing, as Bakugou steps through the door. \nAt the same time, Kaminari asks, \u201cDude, could you text back, ever?\u201d He\u2019s sitting in a chair opposite Kirishima\u2019s desk, lounging with his legs crossed in front of him. His leather jacket is draped over the back of the chair, leaving his arms bare. He has his glasses pushed up into his blond hair. \n\u201cI was busy,\u201d Bakugou says shortly, kicking Kaminari\u2019s legs away from the second chair so that he can sit down. \n\u201cHow\u2019s Tsukino?\u201d Kirishima asks around a laugh, and it takes Bakugou a moment to connect the name with the pink-haired girl from his homeroom class.\n\u201cFine,\u201d he says, baffled. \nKirishima and Kaminari share a look that Bakugou doesn\u2019t like the look of, at all. It\u2019s the kind of look they share before they\u2019re about to start making fun of him, because they\u2019re both idiots who haven\u2019t yet learned that he really will make good on his promise to kill both of them, one of these days.\n\u201cBabe, you\u2019re so cute,\u201d Kirishima says, leaning forward and pinching Bakugou\u2019s cheek.\nBakugou hisses and shoves Kirishima away from him. \u201cGet the fuck away from me, I\u2019m mad at you,\u201d he says, before he can think better of it. And he is mad at Kirishima, back in a time that makes sense and when they\u2019re both sixteen years old. Does he have anything to be mad about, in this time? \nKirishima frowns thoughtfully. \u201cMad just because, or mad because I did something that you genuinely want me to stop doing?\u201d \nFuck, Bakugou thinks. Fuck fuck fuck. What is he supposed to say, to that? \n\u201cUgh, you guys are gross,\u201d Kaminari says, although he doesn\u2019t sound particularly disgusted. \u201cAnyway, Bakugou and I have some paperwork to go over, so we\u2019ll see you later, Kirishima.\u201d \n\u201cPaperwork?\u201d Kirishima asks. \nBut Kaminari just waves a hand at him, saying, \u201cOh, you know,\u201d and grabbing Bakugou by the arm to hoist him out of his seat. \u201cC\u2019mon, sensei.\u201d \nBakugou lets Kaminari lead him out of the room, if only because being around Kirishima is confusing as hell. Does he always smile that much, around Bakugou? \nKaminari opens the door to an office across the hall and then shuts the door behind them. This office is less red in its decor, and there are band posters stuck up on the walls. Kaminari sits down on one end of a plush purple couch and pats the area beside him. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Bakugou says articulately, pulling over the desk chair to sit across from him. \u201cAlso, what stupid paperwork can you not take care of on your own, you useless\u2014\u201d\nKaminari glances at him sideways. \u201cOkay, first off, you know and I know that there\u2019s no boss around here, but the government still wants us all technically under someone\u2019s charge. So, you\u2019re the head hero, whether you like it or not, and that means you\u2019ve got to sign off on some papers every once in a while.\u201d \n\u201cI know that,\u201d Bakugou says, because it\u2019s the sort of thing his older self would have to know. He does wonder at how the hell this agency is structured, because there\u2019s no way Kirishima and Kaminari are his sidekicks. This must be like no agency that exists, in his time. \n\u201cBut anyway,\u201d Kaminari says, sighing dramatically. \u201cIf you ever picked up your phone or answered your messages, I would not have to conspire to talk to you away from your doting husband. You know he wanted to crash lunch at Yuuei today to make sure you were okay? I had to physically hold him back, which isn\u2019t easy.\u201d \nSomething in Bakugou\u2019s stomach does a flip. He forces the sensation down. \u201cWhat the hell do you need to talk about, then?\u201d \nKaminari rolls his eyes. \u201cDude, you were the one who asked for our help! So, can you get it together, please? I knew you\u2019d be moody about this, after last year, but when you came to me and Ashido and Uraraka we genuinely thought you were trying, at least.\u201d\nBakugou frowns. He\u2019s clearly out of the loop, here, and not reacting in the right way. But at least this is Kaminari\u2014 he knows how to deal with him.\nBakugou leans forward in his chair and levels Kaminari with a look. \u201cPretend for a moment that I\u2019m as much of a dumbass as you are. Explain what the fuck you\u2019re talking about.\u201d \nKaminari kicks at his ankle in retaliation, but then just shakes his head. \u201cYou know how there years ago, you and our best friend tied the knot in front of the entire world? And about how the next year he whisked you off for a week-long vacation in the mountains for your anniversary? And then last year, he obviously couldn\u2019t do that? So, this year, you literally shoved me into a broom closet to ask for my help planning a party for him?\u201d \nA vacation in the mountains, Bakugou thinks, just the two of them. It\u2019s exactly the kind of thing Bakugou would want to do\u2014 even if Kirishima was there, too. And of course, Kirishima would never be married to him if he didn\u2019t know him that well, if he couldn\u2019t plan the perfect anniversary. But then\u2014\n\u201cI asked you for help,\u201d he says flatly. \nKaminari snaps his fingers. \u201cKeep up, Blasty. Yes, you did. Me and Ashido and Uraraka. And then we roped in the rest of the gang, and you were at least not getting in our way! Everything\u2019s pretty much set. I\u2019ll get Kirishima to Yaoyorozu\u2019s place around eight. You just need to get yourself there beforehand, got it?\u201d \nBakugou hates parties. He\u2019d enjoyed them well enough as a little kid, because they\u2019d mostly entailed his little band of followers coming over and his dad making cake and Bakugou getting a pile of presents. But as he\u2019s grown up, he\u2019s grown less and less fond of big, social gatherings. Occasionally, Class 1A will celebrate a birthday, but he hasn\u2019t shown up to those occasions. Kirishima had suggested they spend Christmas together, last year, and\u2014\nGoddamn. Had that been a hint? \nBakugou shakes his head. Now isn\u2019t the time to be thinking about that. The point is, he\u2019d never plan a party, not of his own will. He\u2019d much rather spend a week in the mountains, away from all of these losers. So, why? \n\u201cWhat happened last year.\u201d The words leave his mouth before he can stop them. \nKaminari is looking at him with naked concern, now, and Bakugou hates it. They\u2019re all going to think he\u2019s losing his memory, or his mind. \nBut then Kaminari smiles sadly. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like thinking about it,\u201d he says, \u201cBut, my man, you\u2019ve got to accept that it\u2019s over, now. Kirishima\u2019s okay. And we are going to throw you guys the best party you\u2019ve ever seen. Stop beating yourself up about it, okay?\u201d \nKaminari gets up and claps Bakugou on the shoulder. It\u2019s such a familiar gesture, and Bakugou almost leans into it. Then he remembers himself, and glares up at Kaminari.\n\u201cI\u2019m not beating myself up over anything,\u201d he snaps. \n\u201cSure,\u201d Kaminari agrees easily. \u201cBut eight o\u2019clock tomorrow, okay? Don\u2019t be an asshole and let all our planning go to waste, \u2018kay?\u201d \n\u2014\nHe walks home together with Kirishima. Their apartment forms a triangle with their hero office and Yuuei, equidistant between them. Kirishima keeps talking the entire way there, going over the patrol he\u2019d been on with Kaminari, talking about the mid-level villains they\u2019d taken down. \nThey\u2019ve both changed out of their hero costumes, Kirishima into simple black jeans and a red t-shirt that clashes with his hair. Like Bakugou, he wears a cord around his neck, and from the black leather a simple golden ring hangs. It catches the light of the fading sun as they walk, distracting Bakugou every time he turns to look at Kirishima. \nWhen they\u2019re just outside their apartment building, Bakugou reaches out and grabs the ring as it swings back and forth. It\u2019s cool to his touch, about the same size as the ring hanging from his own neck. The gem embedded in it is a brilliant orange. \n\u201cKatsuki?\u201d Kirishima asks. He looks up at Bakugou from under thick lashes, his expression soft and unguarded. He reaches up and pushes Bakugou\u2019s hair away from his forehead. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Is something wrong?\u201d \nBakugou runs the ring between his fingers one more time before letting it drop, then swallows as he steps away from Kirishima. \u201cNo. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d\nHe\u2019s distracted for the rest of the evening. Kirishima warms up dinner for them, and they eat in relative silence. \nIf this is an illusion, it\u2019s one of incredible detail. Bakugou can taste the hot curry on his tongue, can feel fatigue setting in as the day winds down to a close. And he\u2019s no closer to finding a way out of this than he was this morning.\nBakugou sits on the couch in the living room, staring blankly ahead as he tries to figure out his next move. He doesn\u2019t have as much experience with psychic Quirks as he\u2019d like. The one person he can think of who does is Shinsou, but would a person created by an illusion be able to use their Quirk to break out of it? Not likely. \nIf this illusion is constructed like a computer program, there should be some back door, some failsafe route in and out of it. But how would he go about finding it? \nAnd even if this villain is in Bakugou\u2019s head, how does she know enough to construct a world like this? And if she\u2019s capable of this, what is she doing robbing banks and terrorizing civilians? \nA heavy weight jostles the couch as Kirishima sits down beside him and grabs both of Bakugou\u2019s legs, draping them over his lap. Again, the gesture is so intimate and familiar that Bakugou is too shocked to react. \nKirishima idly trails his fingers over Bakugou\u2019s legs, over his jeans. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t message me back, which means you probably don\u2019t want to talk about it, but you\u2019ve gotta know that if you\u2019re acting this moody, I\u2019m going to be concerned.\u201d \nBakugou swallows. He\u2019s been acting more or less normally, hasn\u2019t he? How else does he usually act around Kirishima? He\u2019s not even angry, just confused by this world and how he fits into it. \nBut Kirishima\u2019s always been able to help him figure out his place. He knows he belongs at the top of Class 1A, but Kirishima is always there to help him navigate his relationships with the other students. During the Sports Festival, it had been Kirishima who had helped him piece together a team with Ashido and Sero. And Kirishima who\u2019s always inviting him along to class outings. And Kirishima who\u2019ll knock on his door and ask him to come study together. And that\u2019s why, when Kirishima had asked Bakugou to meet him outside the school gate after this morning, Bakugou had agreed. Because Kirishima had given him no reason not to.\nBakugou looks away from Kirishima, now. But he still asks, \u201cWhen did you decide you liked me?\u201d \nBecause Kirishima has always been so adamant about his emotions, so sure. \nKirishima laughs lightly. \u201cIs that what you\u2019ve been worrying about? \nBakugou glares, and Kirishima lifts his hands in mock surrender. \n\u201cI\u2019ve told you before, haven\u2019t I? I don\u2019t think it was just one moment.\u201d Kirishima worries his lower lip with one pointed tooth. \u201cWell, okay. That\u2019s not entirely true. It was during our first year at Yuuei. After\u2026 you know. The training camp, and everything else.\u201d\nBakugou bites down hard on the inside of his cheek. It\u2019s not that he can\u2019t hear about Kamino Ward\u2014 for a time, it was all he heard about. He had to be questioned by police, and there were reporters, and then every time he entered a room the echo of conversations would linger. He\u2019s used to it, by now. He\u2019s even discussed the entire incident with Kirishima, because after what Kirishima had risked for him he\u2019d deserved to know.\nBut Bakugou can\u2019t fathom how his getting kidnapped would lead Kirishima to liking him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re making the cutest face right now,\u201d Kirishima says, tapping his thumb against Bakugou\u2019s forehead. \u201cWhy\u2019re you thinking so hard?\u201d\nBakugou frowns. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\nKirishima\u2019s smile is wide and brilliant and honest. \u201cSure, I do. You know, I\u2019ve always admired you. It\u2019s hard not to. But for a while, it was like, a distant thing? You were always so good at everything, and it never seemed like you needed anyone else. But I guess, even though I wish it had never happened to you, knowing that you could need help made me think that there might be room for me in your life.\u201d\nBakugou winces. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou let me in, little by little,\u201d Kirishima continues, almost wistfully. \u201cAnd after that, how could I not love you?\u201d\nHe\u2019s sure his face is bright red. It\u2019s not the first time someone\u2019s said they love him\u2014 his parents say it often enough, and Bakugou isn\u2019t the type of kid who grew up with no affection. By all rights, he should be used to it. But this feels so different, like nothing he\u2019s ever experienced before. He\u2019s always craved admiration and praise, but this naked declaration of love is like an arrow that pierces him straight through. \nKirishima shifts Bakugou\u2019s legs, coming to lean over him. He rests his hands on either side of Bakugou\u2019s head, looking down at him with liquid-dark eyes. \n\u201cI had a feeling that this week would be hard on you,\u201d Kirishima is saying, leaning in until his head forehead rests against Bakugou\u2019s. \u201cBut I am so, so happy that I\u2019m here with you. No matter what.\u201d \nLast year, Bakugou thinks furiously. Something had happened last year, and ruined whatever they would have done over this anniversary. But what was it? He tries to piece together all the clues he\u2019s gotten, the cryptic statements from Yaoyorozu and Kaminari.\n\u201cWas it my fault?\u201d he asks, despite himself. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d \nJust like what happened to All Might was his fault. Maybe every person he admires, and wants to be close to, will end up the same way. \nKirishima smiles tightly, shaking his head. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you that it wasn\u2019t? And I\u2019m fine, in case you haven\u2019t noticed. No harm done.\u201d \nHe closes the space between them, and before Bakugou can move away Kirishima is kissing him. The pressure of his lips is soft at first, then grows rougher and more insistent. Bakugou doesn\u2019t know how to react, but his body moves naturally, his chin tilting up so that his lips fit together against Kirishima\u2019s perfectly. There\u2019s enough force in the kiss to keep him grounded in the moment, even as his thoughts and emotions fly off in a million different directions.\nHe likes this, he realizes. He likes being this close to Kirishima.\nAnd there\u2019s something else here, too\u2014 something he should have figured out sooner. This can\u2019t be an illusion. Because as much as that villain could have gotten into his own head and trapped him in his thoughts, how would she have been able to gain Kirishima\u2019s thoughts and emotions, as well? And there\u2019s no way Bakugou\u2019s psyche could have come up with what Kirishima had said, just now, because he doesn\u2019t understand Kirishima well enough. He never would have arrived at that conclusion, at the stark honesty of the feelings that Kirishima had shared with him. \nAnd if this isn\u2019t an illusion, it must be\u2014 \nBakugou starts to pull away, and Kirishima leans back at the same time. He\u2019s smiling, his lips spit-wet and red. \u201cI don\u2019t regret anything that led us to being right here, right now. You know that, right?\u201d \nBakugou coughs. \u201cWhat kind of fucking manly declaration is that, shitty hair?\u201d His words have no bite to them, and Kirishima laughs in response. \nThey get ready for bed soon after that. When Kirishima casually undresses in front of him, Bakugou gets another look at that stark white scar. It isn\u2019t a burn, or the type of shrapnel damage that would come from an explosion. Instead, it looks like something had pierced Kirishima\u2019s skin. Frowning, Bakugou steps towards Kirishima and places his hand against the white scar tissue. \nKirishima hums softly, then lifts a hand to cover Bakugou\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve been back on duty for six months, Katsuki,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s completely healed.\u201d\nBakugou shudders, then steps away. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I have to like it.\u201d \n\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d Kirishima pouts. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty badass, honestly.\u201d \n\u201cYou have shit taste,\u201d Bakugou reminds him.\nKirishima laughs, twisting around Bakugou to hug him from behind, resting his chin against Bakugou\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSure do. That\u2019s how I ended up with such an agreeable husband.\u201d \nBakugou wants to push him away. He shouldn\u2019t be doing this. He shouldn\u2019t be letting Kirishima touch him so casually, so easily. He shouldn\u2019t be leaning back into the touch. He shouldn\u2019t be memorizing the way Kirishima\u2019s fingertips feel against his bare skin. \n\u201cYou\u2019re the idiot who married me,\u201d Bakugou retorts, half a question hidden in his tone. \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t really say no, the way you proposed.\u201d Kirishima\u2019s laugh reverberates through his chest, against Bakugou\u2019s back. \u201cI thought you were going to kill me, babe.\u201d \nBakugou doesn\u2019t know what to say to that, so he remains silent. Kirishima pulls away from him a moment later, pulling back the sheets on their massive bed and laying down. Bakugou stares at him for a moment, at his inviting smile and the way his hair fans out against the pillow. \nHis face heats up. They\u2019re older\u2014 they\u2019re old. And they\u2019re married. Which means that, in this bed, they\u2014\nBakugou turns around to hide his face. Get it together, he screams internally. You\u2019re trapped in some future hellscape, and this is what gets to you? Sharing a bed? \n\u201cUm, Katsuki? You okay, over there?\u201d \n\u201cJust. Fine.\u201d Bakugou forces the words out from between his teeth, then squares his shoulders and marches towards his side of the bed. He\u2019s wearing a t-shirt over his boxers, but Kirishima\u2019s wearing nothing but loose sleep pants. The covers of the bed are pulled down enough that Bakugou can still see every inch of his chest. It probably isn\u2019t fair to compare Kirishima as he is now to his younger self, but god damn, had he spent the entirety of the last decade pumping iron? \nBakugou reigns himself in as much as possible, getting into bed and lying on his side, facing away from Kirishima. There\u2019s enough space between them. He can get some rest, and then he can wake up in the morning and figure out how the hell to get home. \nHe closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, trying to calm the pounding of his beating heart. But just as he feels himself starting to relax, Kirishima shifts closer, tucking himself in behind Bakugou and draping one arm over his waist. \n\u201cStop being so far away,\u201d Kirishima whines, nosing at the back of Bakugou\u2019s neck. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to see you all day.\u201d \nThis must all be some kind of grand cosmic joke. No one has ever wanted to be closer to Bakugou, not like this. And yet Kirishima is holding onto him as though this is how they sleep every night. \n\u201cNo nightmares,\u201d Kirishima assures him, pressing a kiss to Bakugou\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d \nThe stupid thing is, Bakugou almost believes him. He hasn\u2019t slept well in months, even on days when he\u2019s not being tossed through time by some vindictive bitch of a villain. But Kirishima is a warm and comforting presence around him, and Bakugou feels himself being lulled by the beat of Kirishima\u2019s heart. \nIt\u2019s hard not feel jealous, of the Bakugou who has grown up to deserve this. Even though he\u2019s living in his skin, the younger Bakugou can\u2019t even begin to image what sort of person he grows up to be. He\u2019s not the best hero in the world, and he wastes his time teaching and Yuuei, and he was enough of a failure to let Kirishima take a wound through his chest. So why did Yaoyorozu act like they were friends? Why was Kaminari so adamant about helping him plan some shitty party? Why is Kirishima holding him like this? \nHe doesn\u2019t understand this place. If it isn\u2019t an illusion, if this really is his future, he doesn\u2019t see how he could ever get here. \nAnd yet he lets himself indulge in the warmth of Kirishima\u2019s body against his, lets himself sigh into the contact as he eyes flutter shut. And if his eyes itch and burn as he forces himself to sleep, it\u2019s because he knows one thing for certain.\nHe needs to get back to where he belongs, and fast. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be too late to forget this place.\nThe smoke is so thick around him that Bakugou can\u2019t see. He holds his hands in front of his mouth and noise, trying to draw a breath of clean air, and trudges forward stubbornly even as the smoke burns his eyes. Eventually, he clenches them shut to avoid the worst of the irritation. \nEven when he\u2019s cleared the smoke, the world does not come into focus. Through the darkness, he sees a flicker of green lightning, and immediately heads in its direction. As though he\u2019s surfaced from underwater, noise erupts around him\u2014 the thunderous din of a battle. He ignores the yells and hisses of pain, the explosions and snaps of buildings crumbling. Instead, he keeps his unreliable gaze on the spot of green. \nTime is moving unevenly around him. One instant, the green is only a spot in the distance. The next, he\u2019s standing in front of someone, wiping the blood from his lips as pain courses through his body. \n\u201cKacchan!\u201d The person behind him calls. His voice is slightly deeper than Bakugou remembers, but no less familiar. \u201cWhy did you\u2014\u201d\nBakugou coughs, the taste of iron filling his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me that question,\u201d he says, voice cracking like a steel trap snapping shut. \u201cMy body moved on its own.\u201d \nHe tries to ignore the worst of the pain as he sees a shadow approaching\u2014 it\u2019s not after him. It\u2019s after the green light, the person behind him, whom he has to protect, because\u2014 \nThe shadow descends again, and Bakugou lifts his hands and sets off an enormous explosion, even as the recoil sends pain stabbing through his arms. He grunts as the shadow is blown away, smirking with satisfaction even as he falls to his knees. \nBehind him, his ally has turned, facing down another enemy. And that\u2014 that\u2019s fine. Bakugou will watch his back, and the damn idiot can at least achieve what they\u2019d all come here for. Further away, in flashes of light, he can see ice and fire forming a dual perimeter around the wreckage of the battlefield. Defeated foes float above the scene, kept from rejoining the battle. A glint of silver bolts around the area like a bullet, calling out directions. \n\u201cTake him out first,\u201d a rough voice calls, \u201cWe\u2019ll never get to the Symbol of Peace unless\u2014\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t need to look up to see more shadows descending upon him. And he feels no small measure of pride at being targeted, because they know they\u2019re never going to get to the damn nerd unless they get through him, first. And like hell he\u2019s going to let that happen. \nThere\u2019s at least five of them. Bakugou lets off another round of explosions, but he can\u2019t fucking see and he knows at least a few of them have managed to dodge. He hears the harsh slide of sharpened steel, and know he\u2019s about to be stabbed, or worse. Still, he won\u2019t give up his position. If he moves, the attack will only fall on his ally\u2019s back, and he cannot let that happen. \n\u201cNo!\u201d A voice calls out, rough and pained and so familiar. \nHe doesn\u2019t need to look to know what\u2019s about to happen. He feels it\u2014 first, as a gust of wind when someone runs between him and his attackers. Then, as the sickening sound of something cracking. There\u2019s an intake of breath, and then the person who\u2019d rushed in front of Bakugou falls painfully to their knees.\nWhen he can see again, it is only this\u2014 Kirishima on the ground, arms still extended as though to expand his body into a shield over Bakugou. Red fills Bakugou\u2019s vision\u2014 the red of Kirishima\u2019s hair, the red of the blood pooling around the silver weapon piercing him, the red of Kirishima\u2019s eyes as they dart in every direction, searching for Bakugou. He looks up, blood dripping from the corner of his lips, and smiles.\nBakugou throws his head back and roars. \n\u2014\nHe shoots upright in bed, drenched in sweat and screaming. His throat aches, and his every muscle is tense, and he\u2019s shaking so badly that, at first, he thinks he\u2019s experiencing an earthquake. \nThen, something anchors him. Strong arms around him, a warm chest again his back, a familiar presence all around him. Bakugou takes a shuddering breath, but he still can\u2019t make out the words being whispered, steadily, in his ear. \n\u201cShh, shh, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Kirishima says, finally, when Bakugou can understand again, \u201cYou were dreaming. It was just a dream.\u201d\nWhy the fuck is Kirishima comforting him? Bakugou isn\u2019t the one who just got stabbed, what the hell is trying to pull? \n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d Bakugou says, words tumbling from his lips. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t\u2014 that wasn\u2019t my memory\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt was just a dream.\u201d Kirishima is taking long breaths, holding in the air and letting it go again. Unconsciously, Bakugou starts following along with his rhythm. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream!\u201d His voice rises, now that he has more air to fill his lungs. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a fucking dream, it was a memory, it just wasn\u2019t mine\u2014\u201d\nIt\u2019s only a few minutes later, when Kirishima is rocking them both gently back and forth, and Bakugou has calmed only a fraction, just enough to let his mind start functioning, that he realizes. It was a memory. And it was his. But that memory belongs to the Bakugou who belongs in this body, in this time, in this life. It was something he\u2019d experienced, so visceral that it\u2019s etched into his very cells. He can\u2019t escape it, even in dreams. \nWhich means that, if this truly is his future, then that scene will play out, in time. And he\u2019s going to have to watch it happen. \n\u201cI hate you,\u201d Bakugou says, quietly but with conviction.\nBeside him, around him, Kirishima freezes. \u201cKatsuki?\u201d \n\u201cI should have known,\u201d Bakugou continues, laughing without mirth. His voice sounds like he\u2019s been gargling gravel. His throat feels worse. \u201cI did know, I knew I didn\u2019t want you to get close\u2014 but you did anyway. Why didn\u2019t you fucking listen to me?\u201d \nKirishima pulls away from him, so that they can get a proper look at each other. His face is lined from where he\u2019d lain against his pillow, his hair mussed. Bakugou lingers on the un-familiarities of his face, hating that he isn\u2019t looking at the person he knows. He should be talking to his Kirishima, not this stranger. \n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \n\u201cThis!\u201d Bakugou yells, gesturing wildly at the space around him. Sweat lingers in the dip of his shoulders, around his neck and on his palms. He feels stifled and disgusting. \u201cWhy did I let you talk me into this?\u201d \nKirishima blinks in surprise, recoiling as though Bakugou has struck him. But then his eyes narrow, and he says, with utter conviction, \u201cBecause you love me.\u201d \n\u201cSo what!\u201d Bakugou knows he should try to be more rational about this. He\u2019s dangerously close to blowing his cover, to revealing to Kirishima that he isn\u2019t supposed to be here. He doesn\u2019t know what will happen, then\u2014 if he\u2019ll ruin time, somehow, by being here. Or if he\u2019ll just get sent to a hospital, if Kirishima will think he\u2019s gone insane or been doused by some psychic-based Quirk. \u201cWhat the hell does that matter! My loving you isn\u2019t going to keep you safe, shithead!\u201d \nKirishima doesn\u2019t move towards him. He frowns, hard, every line of his face pulling downwards. \u201cNothing about our lives is safe. Being together was never going to change that, Katsuki.\u201d \nBut it does change it. Because if they are together, if they admit their affections so openly, then Bakugou has the space to feel what he\u2019s been trying to deny for ages, now. And if he can feel those things, he can lose them, and without them how is he supposed to hold himself together? \nHe shudders, seeing All Might dissipating from his heroic form down to a withered husk. But the transformation doesn\u2019t stop. He crumbles into dust in front of Bakugou\u2019s eyes, blowing away. \n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Bakugou says, clutching at his head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d \nKirishima moves, as though to reach for him. But Bakugou curls in on himself, not letting Kirishima get close. After a moment, Kirishima sighs and drops his hand. \n\u201cDo we need to call the school and say you won\u2019t be in today?\u201d \nBakugou thinks of this life, of all the people who expect him to fit into various roles without question. He\u2019s fucking everything up. If he doesn\u2019t go to work, someone is going to want to know why. \nWhen he looks up, Kirishima\u2019s face is guarded. His eyes are distant, his lips pressed into a line that would be neutral on anyone else. But on Kirishima, who smiles constantly, it\u2019s a strained expression. He\u2019s barely holding something in, and Bakugou doesn\u2019t know if he has the strength to deal with whatever it is.\nHe bites down on his tongue so hard that he tastes blood. But then, he shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He kicks off the covers, getting out of bed and heading for the bathroom. \nJust before he shuts the door, he hears Kirishima say, probably to himself, \u201cHappy Anniversary.\u201d \nFuck, Bakugou thinks. Fuck this entire plane of existence. \n\u2014\nAfter that, heading to Yuuei almost seems like a respite. He checks the schedule in his phone, and even with only his elder self\u2019s minimal notes to guide him it\u2019s easy enough to bullshit his way through the morning. \nIn that time, he\u2019s able to come to a few decisions. The first is this\u2014this world, with its details and intricacy and potency, cannot possibly be an illusion. Which means that Bakugou has definitely been pushed forward in time, somehow. Once he\u2019s decided that, it\u2019s easy enough to figure out a plan. \nFirst, he needs to ensure that no one realizes what\u2019s happened to him. He\u2019s read enough comics and played enough video games in his life to know his way around time travel. He\u2019s never heard of anyone actually having a Quirk like this, but the theories are sound. If he messes something up, here, it could have widespread effects on time before and after. He doesn\u2019t want to erase himself from existence, so playing along is the best plan.\nSecond, he needs to find the villain who sent him here. Ideally, she\u2019ll be in prison in this time, and he can use his pull as a pro hero to visit her and demand she send him back to where he belongs. Barring that, he can find someone with a similar enough Quirk to fix things. \nIt\u2019s a simple enough plan, but one that he thinks will work. And focusing on that keeps him from despairing over how strange it is to be here, how much he does not want to deal with Kirishima when he gets home, tonight. \nIn the afternoon, his class is assigned to battle training. He and Yaoyorozu co-teach these sessions, apparently. \nYaoyorozu pulls a series of electronic bangles from her arm, handing them out among the twenty students. \u201cThose will track your progress,\u201d she says brightly, pointing upwards at an electronic score board. \u201cBakugou-san and I will take different ends of the arena, and we\u2019ll each be guarding a series of tokens. If you can get past us, and secure yourself a token, you\u2019ll have completed the lesson. Any questions?\u201d \nBakugou stands just behind her, arms crossed over his chest as he surveys the students. They\u2019re wearing the same blue, white and red uniforms that Bakugou\u2019s class dons for field exercises. Some of them have support items on\u2014 the class rep, Sato, has a glove over one hand that\u2019s covered with gears and sparks with electricity. Another kid, the one with the three-toned hair, wears a belt from which several pouches hang. In each of them, he stashes a deck of cards. Twintails\u2014 or Tsukino, that was her name\u2014 doesn\u2019t wear any support items, but her pale skin has taken on a strange luminescence as she readies her Quirk. The orange-haired kid\u2014 Kurosaki\u2014 materializes a dark blade from the air. \n\u201cRemember, this is a stealth mission,\u201d Yaoyorozu says. \u201cYou\u2019re not trying to injure us, and taking us on in direct combat would probably be beyond any of you. Do your best, okay? Bakugou-san\u2014 did you have anything to add?\u201d \nBakugou looks out over the students and tries to get his head on straight. Now isn\u2019t the time to be thinking about his fight with Kirishima. Was that even a fight? Ugh. Fuck it. \n\u201cDon\u2019t do anything too stupid,\u201d he grunts at the class, before stalking away to take his position on one side of the field. \nFor the most part, the training exercise is uneventful. The first students to reach his position try to rush him head on, which is precisely his definition of \u201ctoo stupid.\u201d He catches them easily, and even without his Quirk he\u2019s able to toss them back across the field. They have the chance to try again, or to switch tactics and go after Yaoyorozu. Some students try for a subtler approach, but Bakugou can find them, too. His body seems more attuned to the world around him than he\u2019s used to\u2014 he can hear them coming, can predict where they\u2019ll try to jump out from. Maybe years of experience as a hero are simply etched into his body, now. \nHe doesn\u2019t know whether the kids are having more luck taking on Yaoyorozu, but he decides not to worry about it. He still has an entire bin full of small, circular tokens. Focusing on just guarding them, having one small objective to achieve, is easy. It clears his mind, after a full day of running in circles like a hamster on a wheel. This may be a fake battle, but it\u2019s still a field he knows how to navigate. It makes sense, unlike personal relationships or anniversaries. \nBut maybe even that stray thought is enough to distract him, because the next thing Bakugou hears is the shuffle of feet behind him, too close. He whips around, palms heating up. \n\u201cSato!\u201d Someone calls out, voice high-pitched but authoritative. \u201cNow!\u201d \nA bolt of electricity runs towards him, similar enough to something Kaminari would discharge that Bakugou knows how to dodge it. But it\u2019s followed by another, and then a third, and Bakugou realizes what\u2019s happening just as he tucks and rolls to avoid getting electrocuted. \nThey\u2019re working together, he thinks. Sato and\u2014 \nHe turns around to see Tsukino, tiny and pink-haired, running lightly towards the bin of tokens. They\u2019re the first students to even try and take him on as a pair\u2014 the others had all just raced in, or paused only to think of an individual strategy. But Yaoyorozu had never said they couldn\u2019t work together. \n\u201cOh, hell no.\u201d They may be clever, but they\u2019re not about to beat him. Bakugou sets off a small explosion, propelling himself forward so that he stands between Tsukino and the tokens. \n\u201cDamn it,\u201d she says, biting down on her lower lip. \n\u201cLanguage,\u201d he says, on reflex, feeling a bit like his own father.\nTsukino looks up at him with raised brows, incredulous. \n\u201cTsukino!\u201d Sato calls from behind them. \u201cLook out!\u201d \nAnd, fuck. As soon as Bakugou half-turns, he realizes why Sato sounds so panicked. She\u2019d set off another charge of electricity, aiming for Bakugou, but now that he\u2019s out of the way it\u2019s headed right for the other girl. And there\u2019s something off about the way that Sato is manipulating it\u2014 she\u2019s not controlling it once it leaves the palm of her hand, somehow channeled through the glove she\u2019s wearing. \nTsukino isn\u2019t going to react in time. She and Sato are smart, but they\u2019re still first years. They don\u2019t move the way Bakugou does, don\u2019t have his honed instincts for this kind of thing. \nBefore Bakugou has a chance to think, his body moves. He pushes off from the ground, reaching out to grab Tsukino by the scruff of her shirt. She squeaks as he pulls her towards him, and Bakugou shifts in midair so that he\u2019s facing the bolt of electricity. With his free hand, he reaches out and detonates to push the two of them out of the line of fire. \nBut the explosion isn\u2019t the low-grade propulsion he\u2019s familiar with. It\u2019s a considerable blast, one that would normally take him a great deal of concerted effort to make. The force of it knocks him backwards. He feels himself drop Tsukino just before his head collides with the ground, blacking out his vision for a moment. \n\u201cSensei!\u201d \nIt takes Bakugou a minute or so to get his bearings, and once he does he sees Tsukino leaning over him, face a teary mess. \n\u201cAre you okay? Sensei!\u201d \nWhy the hell does she look so concerned? Bakugou thinks dimly. It\u2019s just one hit. And besides, if he\u2019s the teacher, it\u2019s his goddamn job to take hits so that his students won\u2019t have to. That\u2019s like, basic shit. \n\u201cGive him some space, Tsukino,\u201d Sato is saying, her voice even but strained. \u201cYaoyorozu-sensei is coming\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, I got this,\u201d Tsukino says, shaking her head. She bites down on her lower lip, then takes a shuddering breath. Slowly, the luminescence returns to her skin, pooling in her hands. She places them gently on either side of Bakugou\u2019s head, and all he can see is bright light, for a moment. When it fades, it takes his pain along it. \nBakugou nudges her away a moment later, less forcefully that he might\u2019ve otherwise. As he sits up, he looks down at his hands with narrowed eyes. His Quirk has always been the one thing that he can rely on. But it was beyond his control, just then. \nIt takes him another moment to realize that here, in this time, he\u2019s gotten stronger. The capacities of his Quirk must have expanded, over the past decade or so. He\u2019s much, much stronger than he could have ever anticipated. And so, like driving a car with a more powerful engine, his basic moves are now accompanied by considerably more power. \nBefore he can think too long on that, Yaoyorozu runs up towards him. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is everyone alright?\u201d \nBakugou gets to his feet and walks over to the bin of tokens, pulling out two and tossing them towards Tsukino and Sato.\n\u201cJust fine,\u201d he says, as the girls catch the tokens in surprise. \u201cI think these two are the only ones who got the point of your lesson, though.\u201d \nYaoyorozu smiles thinly. \u201cI\u2019m sure a few of the others would have figured it out, in time.\u201d \nThey wrap up the lesson soon after that, but as the students head off to the locker rooms, Tsukino lingers. After a moment of trying to ignore her hovering, Bakugou turns to her.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \nTsukino worries at the hem of her shirt, looking both angry and bashful. \u201cSato and I wanted to say that we\u2019re sorry, sensei.\u201d \n\u201cYou should be,\u201d Bakugou says blandly. Not really caring for the way Tsukino\u2019s face falls, he rolls his eyes. \u201cYour strategies shouldn\u2019t be so reckless, in the future. If you get hurt trying to be a hero, who the hell is that helping?\u201d\nHe stalks past her, after that. There\u2019s a knot of emotions coiling in his stomach, too complex for him to easily detangle. But they writhe around in him like snakes, and Bakugou knows he can\u2019t go on like this. \n\u2014\nHe\u2019s back in the staffroom, grabbing his things and preparing to head out for the day. Just as he\u2019s about to leave, the door opens and a dark, familiar figure walks in. \nAizawa can\u2019t be all that old, even after a more than a decade, but he wears fatigue so plainly on his face that he appears ancient. His hair is still dark and long, but there\u2019s a good amount of silver at his temples that bleeds into the dark mass of his hair. His eyes are sunken and bloodshot, the scar under his right eye even more noticeable than it had been in Bakugou\u2019s time. He wears loose, dark clothes, his familiar weapon wrapped around his neck and shoulders. \n\u201cI heard there was a bit of an incident during hero training,\u201d he says, barely giving Bakugou a glance.\nIt\u2019s perhaps the most fucking bizarre situation Bakugou has ever been in. Aizawa looks at him, like it\u2019s entirely normal to see Bakugou in this staffroom. Like he belongs here, like Aizawa runs a school at which Bakugou fits in as a teacher. \nWhy is this place, this time, so goddamn backwards? \nAizawa clears his throat after a moment, when Bakugou still hasn\u2019t answered.\n\u201cIt was fine,\u201d Bakugou mumbles, snapping his phone closed and shoving it in his pocket. \u201cNothing happened.\u201d \nHe keeps his eyes on the ground as he walks past Aizawa, but as he does his old teacher stops him with a hand on his shoulder, eyes flashing. Bakugou\u2019s been leveled by Aizawa\u2019s Quirk enough times to recognize it, but even so it\u2019s disconcerting to be the focus of that gaze. He can sense it when the power of his Quirk is nullified, no longer immediately at his fingertips. But then Aizawa\u2019s hair drops back around his face, and he looks at Bakugou critically. \n\u201cWhatever\u2019s wrong with you, it\u2019s not something I can fix from here,\u201d he says, voice idle enough to hide the question.\nBakugou blinks. How is it, that out of everyone he\u2019s come into contact with in this time, Aizawa is the only one to notice? \nHe scowls. \u201cObviously not,\u201d he says. Although it is an interesting question\u2014 if the villain he\u2019d been after were here, would Aizawa\u2019s Quirk nullify hers and send Bakugou back to where he belongs? \nAizawa sighs heavily, tucking his hands into his pockets. \u201cDeal with your problems yourself, like an adult,\u201d he says, before heading for his desk. \nBakugou purses his lips, still scowling. He doesn\u2019t need Aizawa telling him to ask for help. He doesn\u2019t need it. \n\u2014\nWhen he returns to the hero agency today, it\u2019s mostly deserted. There\u2019s a digital screen in the upstairs hallway that shows off the office\u2019s roster, and where each hero happens to be. And Bakugou has to admit that it\u2019s a formidable list: Red Riot, Chargebolt, Pinky, Cellophane, Earphone Jack, Invisible Girl. Some are off on patrols in groups of two and three, while others aren\u2019t on duty. There\u2019s some kind of rotating schedule\u2014 next to Bakugou\u2019s name, it shows a series of upcoming shifts, the next one starting tomorrow. \nHe wonders how all of these idiots ended up working under his name. Surely, they had offers from other heroes, after they graduated? Or the chance to strike out on their own? Why the hell would they stick around? \nBakugou trudges his way down the hall, to the office that bears his name. He kicks open the door and finds a serviceable space, minimally decorated. Unlike his desk at Yuuei, this one isn\u2019t cluttered with personal affects. But as Bakugou slouches into his chair and boots up the computer, he feels comfortable. There\u2019s no doubt that he designed this place for himself. \nIt takes him a couple tries to crack the computer\u2019s passcode, but once he\u2019s in he pulls up a browser and types in a search.\nCurrent hero rankings |\nIt isn\u2019t what he\u2019s here to find out, strictly speaking. But the question has been gnawing at him, the more he\u2019s experienced of this time. He has to know. \nJust as he expected, and just as he\u2019d dreaded, the first name is a familiar one.\n\nNo. 1 Hero: Deku\n\nBakugou bites down on the inside of his cheek, but before he can despair too much he sees his own name listed under Deku\u2019s. He takes second place to the kid he\u2019s known practically since birth, who he\u2019s always held himself above. And maybe some part of Bakugou knew things would end up this way, ever since he found out about the connection between Deku and All Might. Or maybe it was earlier, during the first practical exercise at Yuuei, when Deku had so soundly beaten him. Losing to Deku had torn down some central facet of his personality, and Bakugou doesn\u2019t know that it\u2019s ever rebuilt itself. That he\u2019s ever recovered from that fundamental blow. \n\u201cNumber two,\u201d he spits, rolling over the words on his tongue. He doesn\u2019t know how to feel. Eventually, he starts to scroll further down the list.\n\nNo. 3 Hero: Shouto\n\nNo. 4 Hero: Uravity\n\nNo. 5 Hero: Creati\n\nNo. 6 Hero: Ingenium\n\nNo. 7 Hero: Red Riot\n\nNo. 8 Hero: Froppy\n\nNo. 9 Hero: Tsukuyomi\n\nNo. 10 Hero: Pinky\n\nAnd on, and on, the list goes. The top ranks are full of his classmates, with some other names sprinkled in here and there. But the message is overwhelming\u2014 the former Class 1A dominates the charts. Even Kirishima, who\u2019d obviously taken some sort of leave of absence after his injury, sits firmly in the top ten. \nBut knowing all of this isn\u2019t going to help him get home. Bakugou exits out of the page and pulls up another search, this time of the villain database. For a moment, his fingers linger over the keys, and he considers typing in Shigaraki\u2019s name, or any of the other fuckers who make up the League of Villains. Would knowing that they\u2019d eventually be brought in offer him any sort of peace? \nIn the end, he decides against it. Knowing won\u2019t help him. So instead, he runs a general search. \n\nQuirk: Time\n\nA list of possible choices pops up, complete with pictures and profiles. Some of the listed villains can freeze time in a radius around them, or manipulate time to switch the locations of objects, or alter the environment by speeding up the seasons. None of the entries describe a dark-haired woman who can push people forward through time. \n\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Bakugou growls out, after looking through the third page of hits. \u201cShouldn\u2019t Deku and Kirishima have caught her, even if she knocked me out? What the fuck are they playing at?\u201d \nIn their classes at Yuuei, Bakugou and his classmates have been taught a lot about different threats a villain might pose. Many of them are physical\u2014 cuts, stabs, burns, and the like. Some villains can do psychic damage, affecting memories and emotions and perceptions. Because new Quirks develop almost as often as babies are born, there\u2019s a near endless list of possibilities. They\u2019ve talked about time, in the abstract\u2014 if someone really could control it, it would have grave consequences for the rest of the world. It would be the type of Quirk that could undo the very fabric of reality. \n\u201cAnd what does she use it for?\u201d Bakugou grumbles. \u201cTo fuck with my head?\u201d \nThere has to be a way for him to find the villain and get himself home, without disrupting things here. He doesn\u2019t know if this is definitely his future, but altering it could have grave consequences for his life and everyone else\u2019s. He isn\u2019t stupid\u2014 he knows how this shit\u2019s supposed to work. Butterfly effect, and all that bullshit. He doesn\u2019t know enough to bank on those theories being wrong, or on time being some immutable, unchangeable force.\nHe keeps looking through the records, following his own case files back as far as they\u2019ll go. But they cut off after the date of his graduation from Yuuei\u2014 they\u2019re all from after he went pro, nothing from his school years at all. \nAfter a few hours\u2019 worth of work, Bakugou shoves aside the mouse and keyboard with frustration. None of this has helped him find a way home, and he still doesn\u2019t know what he should do about Kirishima. Nothing is helping. \n\u2014\nKirishima is still listed as on-duty when Bakugou leaves the hero agency, so he deems it safe enough to head back to their shared apartment. What he doesn\u2019t expect, however, is for there to be someone waiting for him outside the front door. \nShe\u2019s dressed like she\u2019s going to be on some kind of fucking red carpet\u2014 a peach-colored dress made of some wispy material, along with fingerless gloves and heels. Her hair is pulled up into a knot behind her head, leaving just a few pieces loose to frame her face\u2014 a face which is just as round as Bakugou remembers. \n\u201cUraraka,\u201d he says dumbly, as she stands in front of him and taps one foot against the ground. \n\u201cThere you are!\u201d She rounds on him, pointing at him accusingly. \u201cWhere have you been? You were supposed to meet me forty-five minutes ago! And you\u2019re not even dressed!\u201d She pressed both her hands against her face, the picture of despair. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you.\u201d \nIt takes Bakugou a minute to catch up. Then he remembers his thread of missed messages, and the text Uraraka had sent yesterday. \n\u201cWhat are you doing here,\u201d he still grumbles, even though he can guess. \nInstead of answering, she takes one swift step forward and presses her hand against Bakugou\u2019s chest. Since he isn\u2019t expecting an assault, he doesn\u2019t think to dodge, and the next moment he\u2019s floating in the air, somewhere near her head. \n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d he sputters. \u201cPut me down!\u201d \n\u201cNope,\u201d she says, reaching into one of his pockets and extracting a key. \u201cYou have totally lost your privileges for deciding anything, Bakugou-kun! We\u2019re late.\u201d \nShe opens the door to the apartment, then grabs Bakugou\u2019s wrist and tugs him inside, even as he tries to twist away from her. \n\u201cI\u2019ll kill you,\u201d he threatens. Floating midair is a distinctly unsettling experience, nothing at all like propelling himself through the air through the force of his explosions. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you and then I\u2019ll do it again, just so everyone knows how much you deserve it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou asked for my help!\u201d she snaps at him, pointing that accusing finger his way again. \u201cKaminari-kun warned me that you might be like this, but I said, no, he\u2019ll definitely get it together for Kirishima-kun\u2019s sake! Now, are you going to prove Kaminari-kun right, or me?\u201d \n\u201cFucking neither.\u201d Bakugou crosses his arms over his chest and glowers. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the fuck you\u2019re talking about.\u201d \n\u201cYou asked me to come meet you,\u201d Uraraka says with stressed patience. \u201cThis was weeks ago. You said, and I quote, \u2018Come by my place and make sure I\u2019m on time to the party.\u2019 You said that!\u201d \n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Bakugou says, because he cannot imagine a universe in which he would willingly invite Uraraka into his home. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re being so impossible,\u201d she says, tugging him along to the bedroom. \nBakugou could possibly fight her off, but he doesn\u2019t think blowing up his apartment would make for a very good anniversary present for Kirishima. \nUraraka leaves him hanging as she digs into his closet, finally extracting a garment bag and a pair of shiny black loafers. \n\u201cYou smell like smoke,\u201d she says, wrinkling her nose. \u201cIf I let you down to go shower, you won\u2019t do anything stupid, right?\u201d \n\u201cI mean, you\u2019re the one acting like you\u2019ve got a death wish,\u201d Bakugou says, crossing his arms over his chest. He\u2019s aware that, floating in midair, he probably looks ridiculous. But he doesn\u2019t really care, at this point. \nUraraka sighs and brushes her hair away from her face. \u201cWow, you are really acting vintage today, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \nBakugou freezes. Does his elder self act so differently that Uraraka can tell?\nA moment later, he lands in a heap on the floor as Uraraka presses her hands together to release her Quirk.\n\u201cJust go shower,\u201d she says with a sigh. \u201cThen put these on.\u201d She gestures to the clothes she\u2019s laid out on the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll wait in the living room. If you\u2019re not out in twenty minutes, I\u2019ll fight you.\u201d \nShe says this flippantly, as a threat, but with a sort of confidence that makes Bakugou believe her. And, if he\u2019s honest, he doesn\u2019t entirely hate the idea. Seeing how strong Uraraka\u2019s gotten in the past decade is tempting. If she\u2019s the Number Four hero, she must have improved by leaps and bounds. \nBefore he can challenge her, however, Uraraka turns on her heel and leaves the room. \nBakugou sits on the bed for a moment, arms crossed and expression sullen. What the fuck is he supposed to do at an anniversary party? This isn\u2019t his relationship being celebrated. He hasn\u2019t experienced any of what\u2019s brought Kirishima and this future Bakugou together\u2014 not the years of marriage, or the getting together, or the proposal. None of it. \nAnd what the hell does he care for such things, anyway? In imaging his future, he\u2019s never fit anyone else into it. Since he was young, he\u2019s had only one goal\u2014 to be the absolute best hero the world has ever seen. Wouldn\u2019t letting someone in close just take away from that? If he had to wonder, he no longer does, because this Bakugou, who\u2019s tied himself down with marriage and alliances, is Number Two. A failure, in Bakugou\u2019s eyes. \n\u201cI don\u2019t hear the water running!\u201d Uraraka calls from behind the door. \n\u201cFine, back off,\u201d Bakugou growls at her. But he gets to his feet and sheds his clothing, stepping into the bathroom and running through a quick shower. He finds two sets of toiletries at the sink, different kinds of shampoo and conditioner and a truly fearsome-looking brand of hair gel that must be Kirishima\u2019s. \nHe showers quickly and returns to the bedroom, toweling off his hair. The clothes Uraraka has laid out look new\u2014 his elder self must have bought them in preparation for this. Still scowling at the thought of the other Bakugou, he rips off the tags and get dressed. The black pants are a perfect fit, tighter than he\u2019s used to wearing anything. He buttons up the white dress shirt and pulls on a double-breasted vest, burnt orange in color. The ring, hanging from its cord, hangs heavily around his neck. \nA moment later, Uraraka bursts back into the room.\n\u201cWhat is taking so long?\u201d she asks, just as Bakugou grabs a pillow from the bed and chucks it at her. She catches it easily, and it floats away from her face harmlessly. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? What if I was still getting dressed?\u201d \nUraraka rolls her eyes. \u201cNow really isn\u2019t the time to suddenly be self-conscious.\u201d She steps towards him and grabs for his arms, rolling up the sleeves of his shirt up to the elbows. She straightens his collar and takes a step back, assessing. \n\u201cThere\u2019s something seriously wrong with you,\u201d he tells her. \nShe smirks. \u201cI know what Kirishima-kun likes.\u201d \nShe waits for a moment while Bakugou pulls on his loafers, then grabs him by the elbow and drags him outside. \u201cCome on, come on. I had one job for tonight, and you are not going to ruin everyone else\u2019s planning!\u201d \nAnother reason his elder self is a failure? He apparently voluntarily spends time around these so-called friends.\n\u2014\nBakugou has never actually been to Yaoyorozu\u2019s house. He assumes it\u2019s massive, from what Sero and Ashido have said, but none of their stories could have really prepared him. It\u2019s not like his own house is small, but it\u2019s normal. When he and Uraraka arrive at Yaoyorozu\u2019s, Bakugou stops and stares. \nIt\u2019s not just one house, but rather a complex of buildings behind wrought-iron fences. A guard at the gate recognizes Uraraka and Bakugou and lets them in, and Uraraka tugs Bakugou away from the path heading to the main mansion and towards one of the side buildings. The pathways are cobblestoned. Bakugou and Uraraka cut through a rose garden and several fountains on their way. \n\u201cMina-chan got here early to supervise the set-up, and Kaminari-kun is in charge of bringing Kirishima-kun,\u201d Uraraka is saying to him. She still has a firm grip on Bakugou\u2019s elbow, and he briefly considers how badly it would fuck up the future if he blew up her hand. \u201cAnyway. We were supposed to be here a while ago, but we should still beat them.\u201d \nThe building looks like an opera house, all fancy decor and blinding lights. When he steps through the doors, he\u2019s met by a small crowd of people\u2014 the entirety of Class 1A, but older. For a second, his mind doesn\u2019t know where to focus. He keeps seeing these people superimposed over their younger selves, and his brain scrambles to categorize the differences, to note the scars and changes. His head throbs, and Bakugou wrenches himself away from Uraraka so that he can press both hands to his temples. \n\u201cBakugou-kun?\u201d Uraraka leans over him, eyes round with concern. \nBakugou clenches his teeth and straightens himself up. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d \nHe takes a steadying breath and looks around the room again. On the far wall is a DJ\u2019s set up, manned by Jirou. Her hair is more severely angled than he remembers, and she\u2019s wearing a pale purple dress with a leather jacket draped over her shoulders. Next to her, Yaoyorozu stands in a red dress, a crystal glass clutched gently in one hand. Sero and Ashido are hanging up decorations\u2014 red and orange balloons\u2014 Sero in a suit and Ashido in a waistcoat and poofy mint-green skirt. Small crowds of other people are littered across the room\u2014 Aoyama, Ojirou, and a floating dress that must be Hagakure; Iida, Asui, Shouji and Tokoyami; Koda and Sato on the far side, by long tables full of food and drink. And then, just by the doorway\u2014\n\u201cKacchan!\u201d \n\u201cDeku.\u201d Bakugou has to do a double-take, not because Deku looks different from what he\u2019s used to, but because he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s wearing a deep green suit and a red tie that he hasn\u2019t tied correctly, with gloves over his hands. If he has new scars, they don\u2019t show. He\u2019s still shorter that Bakugou, still has round cheeks and round eyes. But there\u2019s a confidence in the way he holds himself, a strength in his stance that has every predatory instinct in Bakugou roaring to the surface. \n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Deku continues, as though he hadn\u2019t heard the venom in Bakugou\u2019s tone. Then, before Bakugou can think, Deku throws his arms around his shoulders and hugs him. \nBakugou stiffens immediately, feels the heat pooling in his palms in warning\u2014 Deku has exactly negative five seconds to let go of him before he blows him straight to hell\u2014\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, okay?\u201d Deku whispers in his ear, confident and quick like he\u2019s relaying a secret message. \u201cCome find me when you have a minute.\u201d \nThen, just as quickly as Deku had grabbed him, he releases Bakugou and steps back with a sheepish smile. \u201cWe were worried you guys wouldn\u2019t make it on time,\u201d he says to Uraraka. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d \nBakugou, still shell-shocked, can barely muster the indignation to protest when Uraraka jabs a thumb in his direction. She and Deku laugh, and Bakugou stalks away to find someone less infuriating to talk to, to give himself time to gather his thoughts. \nBecause, honestly, what the fuck? Does Deku know? How? Who would have told him? He hasn\u2019t seen him since he\u2019s arrived in this time, and there\u2019s no goddamn way he could take one look at Bakugou and figure it out. It doesn\u2019t matter how obsessively, creepily observant he is. \n\u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to explode,\u201d a voice behind him says, casually bland. \nBakugou whips around to see Todoroki standing over him, dressed in a crisp white suit and black dress shirt. He has one eyebrow raised slightly in question. \n\u201cThis is how I always look,\u201d Bakugou spits back. \nTodoroki\u2019s lips quirk in what might be the beginnings of a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t agree with me,\u201d Bakugou says. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking creepy.\u201d \nTodoroki inclines his head slightly. Bakugou has always hated that about him, his ability to keep his cool in any situation\u2014 and, especially, when faced with Bakugou\u2019s ire. He wishes it were easier to get reactions out of Todoroki. Maybe then he wouldn\u2019t feel so inadequate, standing next to him.\nHe\u2019s Number Three, a small voice says in the back of his mind. He isn\u2019t better than you. \nBut Bakugou thinks back to the Sports Festival, and wonders what the numbers even really mean, in the end. \nTodoroki is still eying him critically. \u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re late to your own party?\u201d \nBakugou huffs. \u201cMaybe I was waiting to see how much of the work you\u2019d all do, if I let you.\u201d \nTodoroki\u2019s eyes flick upwards for a moment, and then he shakes his head. \u201cYou know we\u2019d throw you a party every year, if you\u2019d let us.\u201d \nWhy, Bakugou wants to ask. What\u2019s the point of that? Why would they all want to convene to celebrate someone else\u2019s marriage, and his of all people\u2019s? \n\u201cI bet Kirishima would love that,\u201d Bakugou says. Because Kirishima loves being around people, and these people especially. He\u2019s always planning class outings and organizing game nights in Yuuei\u2019s dorms, inviting not only every member of Class 1A but also the Class 1B kids, and sometimes others from General Studies and Support. He\u2019s a magnet for people, and people like him. Which is why Bakugou always wonders why Kirishima shows up late to his own events, just because he\u2019ll stop by Bakugou\u2019s room and spend fifteen minutes talking him into going, too. \nTodoroki blinks at him. \u201cSince when do you call your husband by his last name?\u201d\nFuck. It\u2019s easy to forget how perceptive Todoroki is, especially because he never reacts to anything, but Bakugou should have been more careful. He, of all people, should understand the threat that Todoroki poses. Desperate to find a way to cover himself, he snarls.\n\u201cWhy are you hanging around me, anyway?\u201d \nTodoroki shrugs, seemingly nonplussed by Bakugou\u2019s slip up. \u201cI was told to find out what\u2019s wrong with you, today. Or rather, what you did to upset Kirishima.\u201d He lets out a little sigh, as though he\u2019d been dealt a particularly disappointing hand in a round of cards. \n\u201cBy who?\u201d Bakugou spits back. \n\u201cYaoyorozu.\u201d Todoroki shrugs, takes a sip of his drink. \u201cShe heard it from Jirou, who heard it from Kaminari, who was on patrol with Kirishima this morning. Apparently, he was very upset.\u201d \nNow, Todoroki is looking severely at Bakugou\u2014 almost a glare, but not quite. But Bakugou doesn\u2019t have time to sift through Todoroki\u2019s reactions, because he\u2019s too busy thinking back to this morning and kicking himself. \nOf course, Kirishima had been upset. Bakugou had known that, even as he\u2019d gotten out of bed and walked away from him. But the thing is\u2014 Kirishima is good at hiding things. Better than anyone gives him credit for, which is part of the reason he\u2019s so good at it. Back in the time he\u2019s supposed to be in, Bakugou figures he\u2019s one of the only people in Class 1A who\u2019s actually figured out how insecure Kirishima is. He projects that cheerful, confident shit all the time, so unless someone\u2019s watching him closely, they wouldn\u2019t notice. Bakugou is sure that Kirishima does it on purpose, too, the fucker. \nBut Bakugou has noticed. Kirishima, who\u2019s so good at reading other people\u2019s moods and dealing with them, is also deeply impacted by them. He carries the weight of the entire goddamn world on his shoulders, which is why he does dumb shit like throwing himself in front of actual pro heroes, thinking he can protect them. \nIt\u2019s probably the same quality in him that made him throw himself in front of Bakugou in this time, protecting him the same way. Over a decade, and the idiot still has some sort of martyr complex, some desperate need to prove his own worth. \nWhat kind of shitty husband is Bakugou, that he hasn\u2019t cured Kirishima of this, yet? \n\u201cBakugou?\u201d Todoroki asks, lips curling downward in concern. \nBakugou shrugs him off. \u201cWhy would they ask you? We\u2019re not even friends.\u201d \nTodoroki blinks, and for a second he looks\u2014 upset. Hurt, even. \nBut that doesn\u2019t make sense, because he and Bakugou aren\u2019t friends. And they\u2019re never going to be, because Todoroki is always looking down on him, never taking Bakugou seriously, always just existing in a way that pokes at the bruised parts of Bakugou\u2019s ego. So why would Bakugou stating the truth hurt him? \nTodoroki sighs under his breath, then shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into you, but could you try not to sabotage your own efforts? You went through all the trouble of doing something to make Kirishima happy\u2014 why are you trying to make both of you miserable, now?\u201d \nBakugou grinds his teeth. This, this is what no one understands. He never tries to make himself miserable. It just happens\u2014 the same way he just says things, most of the time, and other people get fucking offended or hurt. He knows he\u2019s a lot to deal with, and difficult to handle. But he\u2019s never fucking asked anyone to try. \nHe didn\u2019t have to ask Kirishima. Kirishima had just stayed, and dealt with things. And apparently still is, a decade later. \n\u201cFuck,\u201d Bakugou says, aloud, raking his hands through his hair. \n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t mess yourself up,\u201d Todoroki says casually. \u201cUraraka probably wouldn\u2019t appreciate you ruining her efforts, either.\u201d \n\u201cI hate you,\u201d Bakugou says, with less heat than he intends. \nTodoroki quirks half of his mouth upwards in a smile. \u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d \nBakugou bites down hard on his tongue. He\u2019s messing this all up. He keeps acting like himself, because he expects his older self to not be so different from him. And yet, everywhere around him is evidence of this older self, who might as well be a complete stranger. He\u2019s nothing like Bakugou, at all. \nBut how can he believe that he could possibly change so much? \n\u201cYou\u2019re probably overthinking this,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cAt least, you look like you are. Just try and cool off a bit before Kirishima gets here.\u201d \n\u201cToo late,\u201d Ashido says, suddenly, running up to grab Bakugou by the elbow. And seriously, why the fuck do they all think they can manhandle him like this? \u201cLook alive, lover boy\u2014 look who just walked in.\u201d \nBakugou barely registers her presence, or her incessant tugging on his arm, because as soon as he\u2019d heard the door open on the other side of the room, he\u2019d frozen.\nKaminari walks in first, dressed in dark jeans and a black blazer over an offensively purple shirt. He\u2019s tugging someone else along, a figure who dominates Bakugou\u2019s vision as soon as he comes into view. \nKirishima is blinking into the light, looking around with confusion that melts into a smile as his eyes land on each of their classmates in turn. Slowly, his look of quiet confusion transforms, smile growing wider and wider, sharp teeth glinting in the light. For a moment, he looks happier than Bakugou has ever seen him. \nAnd then, his eyes land on Bakugou, and his expression transforms completely, again.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d Bakugou says, not intending to speak aloud. But the words drop from his mouth like stones into a river, sending ripples out around him. He can\u2019t do this, not when Kirishima is looking at him, like that. Not again.\n\u2014\nKirishima is waiting by Bakugou\u2019s desk when he gets to the classroom, standing with his hands in his pockets and looking sheepish. \n\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s your problem?\u201d Bakugou asks, nudging Kirishima aside so that he can sit down. The last thing he wants is Iida yammering in his ear about proper etiquette at eight in the fucking morning, again.\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Kirishima says, too loudly. And then, again, \u201cNothing, nothing. I was just gonna ask\u2014 are you busy after class?\u201d \nBakugou blinks at him. He knows Kirishima\u2019s grades aren\u2019t the best, but he usually doesn\u2019t act this stupid. \u201cInternship, remember?\u201d \n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Kirishima says, cheeks turning red. Is he sick? He waves his hands ineffectually, then says, \u201cBut we\u2019ve got a little time before that, right?\u201d \nBakugou blinks at him. \u201cSure?\u201d \n\u201cGreat!\u201d Kirishima says, pumping a fist in the air. Then he freezes, almost comically, to add\u2014\u201cDo you mind meeting me on that hill outside the cafeteria, then? It\u2019ll only take a minute.\u201d \nBakugou is usually fairly indulgent of Kirishima\u2014at least, by his own standards\u2014but he has no idea what the guy is playing at, right now. \u201cYou want us to both separately leave this room at the same time, so that we can meet again on a hill halfway across campus.\u201d \n\u201cWell, when you say it like that, it sounds stupid.\u201d Kirishima pouts. \u201cBut, yeah. So, will you?\u201d\nKirishima has a strange look in his eye as he looks down at Bakugou. Everything about him seems round and hopeful\u2014his eyes, the curve of his lips, the line of his jaw. There\u2019s emotion in his eyes, something that Bakugou can\u2019t put a name to. But the weight of it is heavy, on his chest, and makes him feel like there\u2019s a hamster running laps in the space between his lungs. \nDespite all appearances otherwise, it\u2019s difficult for Bakugou to say no to Kirishima. And if he were smarter, he would\u2019ve thought about that fact before now and dealt with it. As it is, he\u2019s left blinking at Kirishima like he\u2019s the brightest part of a lightbulb, squinting as he says\u2014\n\u201cSure. Whatever. Get away from my desk, now.\u201d \n\u201cGreat!\u201d Kirishima punches Bakugou in the shoulder before running off to his own desk, just before Iida walks in and tries to herd the class into some semblance of order. \nBut for the rest of the day, Bakugou is distracted, chin balanced against his hand as he looks out the corner of his eye at Kirishima and tries to make sense of the expression he\u2019d been wearing.\nBakugou laughs. Sixteen years old and standing on Yuuei\u2019s grounds, he laughs. His chest is tight as the sound escapes him, ugly and too loud. He looks up at the sky, defiant and proud, but only for a moment. Then his gaze drops, and Kirishima comes back into view. \n\u201cAre you joking?\u201d Bakugou asks hoarsely. \nKirishima presses his lips together, and he would be pouting if it wasn\u2019t for the severe angle of his brows. He\u2019s angry, angrier than Bakugou has ever seen him.\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m not joking!\u201d Everything about him is red, and that makes it hard to concentrate. His hair, his eyes, the color in his cheeks. \nBakugou clenches his teeth. Kirishima has to be joking. There\u2019s no way this moment is real. \n\u201cI always knew you were an idiot, but I never thought you were stupid.\u201d He lets the words fall between them, even though they aren\u2019t true. Kirishima isn\u2019t first in the class, or fifth, but Bakugou has never thought of him as stupid. Kirishima, who can navigate the personalities of Class 1A with ease, who can talk to anyone, who understands Bakugou\u2019s own churning emotions when he doesn\u2019t understand them himself\u2014he\u2019s no fool. \nKirishima punches him. \nBakugou doesn\u2019t see it coming, and the minute Kirishima\u2019s fist collides with his cheek he\u2019s send sprawling against the grass. He hasn\u2019t taken a hit this directly in ages, and pain courses through the side of his face in time to the frantic beat of his heart. \n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d he screeches, pushing himself up to his feet, tiny explosions already crackling from his palms. \u201cDo you want to die?\u201d \nKirishima\u2019s expression has shifted into one of open defiance. \u201cYou\u2019re the one being stupid,\u201d he says, hands clenched at his sides. \nEvery muscle in Bakugou\u2019s body tenses, like he\u2019s a wind-up toy about to be released. \u201cFuck you,\u201d he spits. \nKirishima rolls his eyes. Then he shakes his head and says, almost to himself, \u201cI thought you were really changing.\u201d He sounds\u2014not just angry, but also sad and disappointed. \nBakugou has always lived and died on the praise of others, as much as he\u2019s loathe to admit it. So hearing Kirishima sound so utterly disappointed with him lances him through the heart, deflating his anger as his ego curls up around him protectively. \n\u201cI\u2019m not going to cushion your fucking feelings,\u201d he says, throwing out a hand between them. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who dragged me out here like some shitty manga character, under this goddamn fucking cherry tree.\u201d \nNow Kirishima throws up his hands in exasperation. \u201cBecause this is our spot, you idiot! You always come out here when you want to get away from everyone else, but you never tell me to leave when I follow you! It\u2019s not some stupid clich\u00e9, it\u2019s about us!\u201d \nBakugou snarls. \u201cThere is no us! Get that through your shitty head! You\u2019re not special!\u201d \nHurt shows on Kirishima\u2019s face, like the first crack in a vase before it shatters. But then, instead of shuttering, his expression opens up. He looks straight at Bakugou and asks, without any accusation in his tone, \u201cWhat are you so scared of?\u201d \nBakugou yells out a curse, crossing the space between them before he can even think. He catches Kirishima around the shoulders and tackles him to the ground, grappling with him and trying to hit him even as Kirishima\u2019s skin hardens instinctively. \nThis isn\u2019t the way he fights. This isn\u2019t the way he does anything. He usually thinks first, and formulates a plan. He attacks and retreats in quick bursts, never giving his opponent a chance to land a hit on him. He doesn\u2019t act out in violence just because anger overtakes him. This isn\u2019t like him. \n\u201cI fucking hate you,\u201d he screams. \nKirishima doesn\u2019t need to fight back. Unless Bakugou actually tries to blow him up, no hit will get past his armored skin. Flat on his back, with Bakugou pinning him down, he lies there and takes the hits with sadness in his round eyes. \nI thought you were really changing, he had said, just a few minutes ago. And before that, not sad but hopeful, he\u2019d asked, Do you like me as much as I like you?\n\u2014\nIt\u2019s unfair, how handsome Kirishima has grown over the years. Now, stepping into the event space at Yaoyorozu\u2019s home and blinking in the lights, he\u2019s startlingly attractive. In dark blue suit and a deep red shirt, he should look ridiculous. But the colors only set off his stupid hair, his bright eyes. He looks around at his gathered friends and laughs nervously as all eyes focus on him. In a moment, everyone is upon him, clapping his back and offering their congratulations.\nAcross the room, trapped by Todoroki and Ashido on either side of him, Bakugou subtly tries to melt into the wall. His chest is tight, his pulse pounding in his ears. Every instinct he has is screaming at him to run, but he can\u2019t tear his eyes from Kirishima. \n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Ashido asks, turning towards him. \u201cYou sort of look like you\u2019re having a panic attack.\u201d \nShe probably doesn\u2019t mean it flippantly, but the moment she says it Bakugou realizes that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. He hears a roaring in his ears, like a wave has just crashed over him. He can\u2019t move. \nBeside him, Todoroki puts a hand on his shoulder. \u201cBakugou?\u201d His voice is just barely inflected, just insistent enough to sound concerned. His hand is cold\u2014his right side, then, and not the left. \nBakugou\u2019s vision tunnels, but then his eyes resettle on the spot of red across the room. Kirishima is laughing and gently nudging their friends away from him, crossing the room as quickly as he can. His smile is so wide that Bakugou could probably count each of his pointed teeth. \nBut he doesn\u2019t get the chance, because as soon as Kirishima is near he yells out, \u201cKatsuki!\u201d in an exuberant voice that echoes off the walls. Before Bakugou can move, or say anything, Kirishima grabs him by the waist, hoisting him up and spinning him around. The room blurs around him\u2014spots of color, but mostly red. \nKirishima is still laughing when he stops spinning them, when he clutches at Bakugou\u2019s hips and says, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did this for me.\u201d His eyes are shining with joy, with unshed tears. He looks so unequivocally happy, the same way he does in the picture on Bakugou\u2019s desk in the staff room. He looks like Bakugou has made him happy.\nBakugou is floating in midair, held aloft and anchored by the weight of Kirishima\u2019s grip. And looking at Kirishima now, he knows something with certainty\u2014he could be the one impaling Kirishima through the chest, he could reach in and wrench out Kirishima\u2019s still-beating heart, and Kirishima would let him do it. \nIt\u2019s a thought that hits him like a lightning strike, instantaneous and bright and certain, but terrifying and dangerous at the same time.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Bakugou says, and his voice sounds like it\u2019s coming from somewhere else, external to himself. \nKirishima laughs again, shakes his head as he sets Bakugou back on his feet. \u201cOf course you\u2019d say that,\u201d he says fondly. Then he leans in a kisses Bakugou\u2019s cheek. \nThis isn\u2019t right. Bakugou, as much as he enjoys being praised, doesn\u2019t want anything he hasn\u2019t earned. And this, none of this, belongs to him. He didn\u2019t plan this party. He didn\u2019t coordinate any of it, or help in any way. He\u2019s not married to Kirishima, and therefore has nothing to celebrate today. He couldn\u2019t even accept Kirishima\u2019s confession, back in his own timeline. He has not earned Kirishima\u2019s affection, and certainly not his love. \nHe pushes Kirishima away. \n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, voice too loud. \nKirishima stares at him, brow furrowing. \u201cKatsuki?\u201d \nHe\u2019s about to ruin everything, he realizes. Even if this isn\u2019t his future, it\u2019s someone\u2019s life that he\u2019s about to ruin. Whoever belongs in this body, whichever version of him ends up with such happiness, he\u2019s going to ruin all of it. But he can\u2019t help himself. Just like when he\u2019d laughed at Kirishima yesterday, acting before he could think or process what he was feeling. \n\u201cNo.\u201d It\u2019s even louder, this time, echoing around the room. All conversation stops. The eighteen or so people gathered in the room with them all stare, and Bakugou can feel the force of their confusion and worry like a weight that\u2019s been dropped on his chest. \nKirishima is leaning into his space, scrutinizing him with wide eyes. The happiness is gone, but his expression is familiar. He\u2019s concerned, and he\u2019s concerned about Bakugou. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d \nIt\u2019s not fair. Bakugou wants to be the person who\u2019s earned this concern, who can step into the comfort Kirishima is offering him. But he can\u2019t. Because this isn\u2019t his life, and this Kirishima doesn\u2019t belong to him. \nHe\u2019s so used to facing down any wall he comes to, laughing with defiance because he can break down anything, blow it to pieces and move past it. But this isn\u2019t a wall, this isn\u2019t an obstacle that he wants to get through. This is a person, a life, that will shatter before him if he makes the wrong move. And Bakugou doesn\u2019t know if he could live with that. \nNineteen pairs of eyes are on him, but he ignores them all. He shoves Kirishima aside, barrels towards the door, and takes off at a run.\n\u2014\nThis fucking place is enormous, made up of so many different buildings and pathways that Bakugou is hopelessly lost within a matter of moments. He hadn\u2019t been paying much attention when Uraraka had led him through the grounds the first time, and he\u2019s even less aware now as he forces himself to keep running even as his lungs start burning.\nThe cobblestones are uneven beneath his feet, through the expensive leather of his loafers. He spots a rose garden and a grove of trees, a structure that might be a goddamn horse stable. But he keeps going, because the instant he stops he\u2019ll have to face all that\u2019s rushing up to catch him. \nHe stumbles, crashing down hard on the ground. His palms smart as he pushes himself back up, and he hisses in anger because his hands are his Quirk, his life, and now they\u2019re scraped and red.\nSomewhere in the back of his mind, a voice that sounds suspiciously like his own reminds him that his Quirk isn\u2019t the entirety of his life\u2014at least, not in this time. He\u2019s a teacher, and the head of a ridiculously over-powered hero agency. He has friends and allies who probably don\u2019t define him by the strength of his explosions. He has a husband, who keeps loving him even when Bakugou wakes up screaming from nightmares. \nBakugou clenches his hand into a fist and slams it down against the stones. \u201cDamn it\u2026 damn it\u2026 god fucking damn it!\u201d With each curse, he hits the ground with more strength, even as pain races up his arm. \nHis eyes sting as furious tears drip down his face, and Bakugou doesn\u2019t bother trying to brush them away. Crying is no less humiliating now that he\u2019s an adult\u2014his throat clogs up and his nose drips, his cheeks heating up as he hits the ground and screams out his frustrations. \n\u201cHey,\u201d a quiet voice says. \nEven though Bakugou is spitting out curses, it\u2019s like he\u2019s attuned to that voice and knows when to listen for it. One last word dries up in his throat as he struggles for breath, but he doesn\u2019t move or speak as Kirishima comes to kneel beside him. Bakugou stares resolutely at the ground even as Kirishima places a steadying hand at the small of his back. \n\u201cYou\u2019re really freaking me out, you know,\u201d Kirishima continues in the same soft tone. \nBakugou almost laughs, but it gets strangled in his wheezing lungs. Kirishima thinks he\u2019s freaking out? He\u2019s not the one living someone else\u2019s life.\n\u201cIf I ask again, will you tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d \nBakugou wants to say yes. In the months since their failed training camp, since Kamino Ward, he\u2019s been able to talk to Kirishima more and more. It\u2019s safe to talk to Kirishima, not like admitting a weakness. And Bakugou doesn\u2019t tell him everything, but on the days when his emotions are more than he can take, giving some of them over to Kirishima helps. It would help now, he\u2019s certain, except he\u2019s the wrong Bakugou and this is the wrong Kirishima.\nKirishima sighs softly when Bakugou doesn\u2019t answer, but then stars rubbing his back in soothing circles. He reaches out with his other hand to grab Bakugou\u2019s, hissing in sympathy when he sees the scrapes along his palms. \n\u201cWhy are you doing this to yourself, babe?\u201d \nBakugou hates that question. He remembers it ringing through his head when he\u2019d woken up after that failed, stupid battle with All Might, when he\u2019d been forced to partner with Deku. He\u2019d been so angry at Uraraka for being self-destructive during the Sports Festival, at Deku for ripping himself apart for no fucking good reason. And yet, when he\u2019d been forced to examine himself, he\u2019d seen someone raw and exposed and not very good at self-preservation. \nBut he still doesn\u2019t know how to say that all the things he\u2019s done to hold himself together are all the same things that are ripping him apart. \n\u201cI need to get the fuck out of here,\u201d he says, finally. His voice is hoarse and he can\u2019t look Kirishima in the eye. He\u2019s still on his knees, on the ground.\nKirishima hums softly. \u201cWhy?\u201d The pressure of his hand on Bakugou\u2019s back is soft and constant and patient. \n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t fucking belong here!\u201d Bakugou snaps, pushing Kirishima away. He sits up, glaring defiantly.\nKirishima tilts his head to one side, looking at Bakugou with assessing eyes. He seems to take Bakugou\u2019s words to heart, perhaps scrutinizing him and every moment they\u2019ve had together since Bakugou woke up in this time. \n\u201cOf course you belong here,\u201d Kirishima says slowly. \u201cWhere else should you be?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not him!\u201d Bakugou says, frantic now. He doesn\u2019t even know how to make Kirishima understand. He just knows he can\u2019t keep up the act any longer, not when every moment of it is like a knife in his heart. \nKirishima still looks confused. \u201cWho are you, then?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not that person!\u201d Bakugou says, and now it all comes spilling out of him at once. \u201cI\u2019m not this fucking perfect husband who can plan you a shitty fucking anniversary party! I\u2019m not whoever the fuck gets up every morning to teach a bunch of snot-nosed brats! I\u2019m not fine being the Number Two Hero! I\u2019m not the person you\u2019re supposed to come home to, and eat dinner with, and sleep next to! Don\u2019t you fucking get it?\u201d \nKirishima blinks at him, startled hurt crossing over his features. \u201cAre you not happy Katsuki?\u201d \n\u201cNo! I\u2019m not! I\u2019m not fucking happy!\u201d The tears are coming back, furious and unstoppable. \u201cAfter this I\u2019m never going to be happy again!\u201d \nKirishima recoils, but then steels himself. He sits back, reaching out to grab both of Bakugou\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou need to take a breath, and then tell me exactly what you mean.\u201d \nHe can\u2019t. He can\u2019t take a breath, because he\u2019s suffocating. Why doesn\u2019t Kirishima get that? \n\u201cKatsuki,\u201d Kirishima says softly. He grabs one of Bakugou\u2019s hands, spreading it flat and placing it against his chest, over his heart. \u201cBreathe with me, okay?\u201d\nHe counts his breaths slowly, in and out. Bakugou can feel the beat of Kirishima\u2019s heart against his palm, and slowly, so slowly, the rhythm seeps into the very core of his being. He takes one shuddering breath, and then another. \nKirishima smiles, and then uses his free hand to brush Bakugou\u2019s hair back from his brow. \u201cNow,\u201d he says, after a moment. \u201cTell me.\u201d \nBakugou bites down on the inside of his cheek so hard that he tastes blood. Then he looks up and says, \u201cI\u2019m sixteen fucking years old.\u201d \n\u2014\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard me,\u201d Bakugou says, voice still wavering and hoarse. \u201cI\u2019m sixteen, I\u2019m not supposed to be in this time, I got hit by some psycho\u2019s Quirk and now I\u2019m here.\u201d \n\u201cHoly shit.\u201d \nBakugou glowers.\n\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d \n\u201cWhy the fuck would I make that up, shit-for-brains?\u201d \nKirishima presses his lips together in a firm line, but then he breaks. Laughter bubbles out of him. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s not even possible. I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\u201cStop laughing,\u201d Bakugou demands, furious. \u201cI\u2019m fucking serious.\u201d He pulls away enough to punch Kirishima in the shoulder, which sobers him. \n\u201cHow long ago did this happen?\u201d he asks meekly. \n\u201cTwo days.\u201d \n\u201cO-kay.\u201d Kirishima runs a hand through his hair. \u201cOkay. Okay. That\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s really something. Two days\u2014I\u2014you\u2019re sixteen?\u201d \n\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be some amazing hero who can keep his head in a crisis?\u201d Bakugou snaps at him. \nKirishima is smiling, but his expression betrays nothing so much as nervousness. He keeps running his hands through his hair, muttering to himself, trying to make sense of things. Bakugou can\u2019t really blame him\u2014he\u2019s probably never experienced anything like this, before. He can\u2019t possibly know what Bakugou is going through, what he\u2019s feeling.\nAnd then, all at once, Kirishima\u2019s arms are around him, pulling him close and crushing him against Kirishima\u2019s solid chest. The embrace is so sudden that it steals Bakugou\u2019s breath, disorients him for a moment. \n\u201cKatsuki, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Kirishima is saying, still holding him tightly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t notice. You must have been so scared.\u201d \nBakugou stiffens immediately. \u201cFuck you. What the hell would I be afraid of? I\u2019m not scared of anything.\u201d \nKirishima chuckles, and Bakugou can feel it reverberating through his chest. \u201cGod, I forgot what you used to be like. No wonder you\u2019ve been so grumpy.\u201d \nBakugou is incensed, but he doesn\u2019t pull away. Kirishima\u2019s embrace is too solid, and he\u2019s too selfish to push away from the comfort. \u201cI\u2019m always fucking grumpy, idiot.\u201d \nKirishima hums. \u201cWell, yeah. But not the way you\u2019ve been, lately. I mean, I guess back in high school, you were\u2014but that was something even deeper than grumpiness. It took me a long time to figure you out. Sixteen. Shit. We barely knew each other when we were sixteen.\u201d \nThat, Bakugou takes offense to. What does this old man know? Sure, he met Kirishima less than a year ago, but they know each other just fine. He knows that Kirishima wakes up slow in the mornings, and that he\u2019s always concerned that his Quirk isn\u2019t flashy enough. Bakugou knows that Kirishima and Kaminari have a secret language of foot taps that they use to communicate during class, and when they tap their feet three times in unison it means they\u2019re talking about him, those fuckers. Bakugou knows that Kirishima had been prepared to risk everything, including his place at Yuuei, to rescue Bakugou from the League of Villains. He knows that Kirishima has actually taken the time to understand him, to parse his moods instead of writing him off as a problem child. He knows that Kirishima isn\u2019t scared of him, and that Kirishima had worked up the courage to say something that Bakugou\u2019s never been able to articulate. \n\u201cA Quirk, you said\u2026\u201d Kirishima is still muttering. \u201cHuh. How are we going to get you home, if you really don\u2019t belong here?\u201d\nThat hurts, more than it should. He feels Kirishima\u2019s words like a punch. Of course, he wants Bakugou gone. He wants some other person back, in his place.\n\u201cOh, Katsuki. No.\u201d Kirishima presses his hands against Bakugou\u2019s cheeks, forces him to look up. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that, I promise.\u201d\nBakugou glowers at him. Kirishima doesn\u2019t have to spare his fucking feelings. He doesn\u2019t need his pity. \n\u201cYou have to go home,\u201d Kirishima is saying. \u201cI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong. I love you. And I\u2019ve loved you almost as long as I\u2019ve known you. But you\u2019ve got to go back and live your life. It\u2019s going to be\u2014well. I\u2019m a little biased. But I think you\u2019re going to like it.\u201d \n\u201cWhat the fuck do you think I\u2019ve been trying to do?\u201d Bakugou yells, pushing Kirishima away again. He doesn\u2019t want to hear this, not now. \u201cJust fucking around? I can\u2019t find the asshole who did this to me. There\u2019s no time Quirks that fucking work like this! Why would I want to hang around in this fucking hellscape future?\u201d \nKirishima tilts his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t like anything about your life?\u201d \nIt\u2019s not that. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t like it. And if Kirishima knows him as well as he should, after over a decade, he should know that, too. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not real!\u201d The words escape him without his express permission, pressing down hard on his heart. \u201cThis can\u2019t be real!\u201d \n\u201cWhy not?\u201d \n\u201cBecause I can\u2019t do this!\u201d Fuck. He hadn\u2019t meant to say that. But being around Kirishima makes it too easy to talk, loosens his tongue in ways he can\u2019t control. \u201cI just can\u2019t. I am never going to be this person!\u201d \nKirishima frowns, not in anger but in thought. Then he leans back slightly and asks, \u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d \n\u201cBecause no one can change that much, idiot! I can\u2019t change this much! I don\u2019t\u2014I haven\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t be this person who does all these things! That\u2019s not me!\u201d \nThere\u2019s a tension in Kirishima\u2019s face as he smiles and shakes his head. \u201cYou know you didn\u2019t actually plan that party, right?\u201d \nBakugou glares. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d \n\u201cI mean, you did, sort of. But according to Denki, what you really did was ask for help. I know you don\u2019t like being around people all that much. That hasn\u2019t really changed. That was why, the first year, we went up to our place in the mountains.\u201d His gaze turns fond, like he\u2019s reliving the memories. \u201cAnd, babe\u2014I mean. Katsuki. It was fucking awesome.\u201d \n\u201cSo?\u201d Bakugou\u2019s breathing heavily again, and he wishes Kirishima would get to the damn point. \n\u201cSo, you didn\u2019t do this because all of a sudden, you\u2019re a different person who wants different things. You did this for me. Because you knew it was what I\u2019d want.\u201d \nHe\u2019s about to throw up, probably. Too many emotions are churning around in his stomach, each fighting to be the first to rise up into his throat. It\u2019s dizzying. \n\u201cAnd, yeah, maybe you\u2019re never going to be good at organizing a party, or whatever. But you asked our friends to help you do it, because you knew it\u2019d make me happy. And it did. I\u2019m so, so happy.\u201d Kirishima sniffles, a bit, smiling as the skin around his eyes wrinkles. \nBut that\u2019s still not who Bakugou is, is it? Accommodating that much for another person\u2014when has he ever done that, before? When has he ever wanted to? \nKirishima cups his cheek, lifting Bakugou\u2019s face upwards. \u201cGive yourself some credit, will you? I learned a long time ago that having a little patience, when it comes to you, goes a long way. Maybe you should be a little more patient with yourself.\u201d \nKirishima is a fucking idiot. He\u2019s a fucking idiot who\u2019s smiling at the sixteen-year-old version of his husband. His a fucking idiot who\u2019d followed him out here to comfort him instead of being mad that this fuckery had ruined his anniversary and taken his actual spouse away from him. \n\u201cYou know,\u201d Kirishima says wistfully, \u201cI\u2019m almost jealous. When we get you home, you\u2019re going to have so much good stuff ahead of you. I wish I could do it all again.\u201d \n\u201cYou got stabbed in the fucking chest!\u201d Bakugou yells, punching Kirishima in the sternum for emphasis.\nHe laughs, and catches Bakugou\u2019s fist. \u201cEh. Win some, lose some. Give up a little, gain a lot. It\u2019s one of those lessons they didn\u2019t focus on at Yuuei, but I think we all learned it eventually, anyway.\u201d \nBakugou is rapidly finding that being on uneven ground with Kirishima is deeply unsettling. When they\u2019re both sixteen, they even each other out\u2014Bakugou excels in ways that people can see, and Kirishima has subtler strengths that even he doesn\u2019t recognize, half the time. But with this older Kirishima, who\u2019s mature and wise and experienced, Bakugou only feels left behind. \n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Kirishima says, rising to his feet and reaching down to pull Bakugou up, \u201cWe\u2019ve got all the world\u2019s best heroes in a room together, I\u2019m sure one of them can help us figure out how to get you home.\u201d \n\u2014\nThey don\u2019t make it as far as the banquet room. As they approach the extravagant building, Deku is running down the pathway to meet them. His feet are surrounded by tiny flickers of green light as he makes himself go faster.\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d he says, stopping in front of them. \u201cKacchan, we\u2019ve got to go!\u201d \n\u201cGo where?\u201d Kirishima asks.\nDeku holds up his phone screen, where a rapidly-scrolling message shows an issued villain alert. \u201cYou told me last week that there\u2019d be a hit on a bank near here tonight, and that we\u2019d have to go together.\u201d His brow furrows, and he looks at Bakugou with a wry smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t really get it at the time, but this is her, right?\u201d \nOn the screen is a small, blurry photograph of a woman, wearing white and black. As she runs out the door of the bank, her long black ponytail trails behind her. Her face is obscured by a Venetian half-mask. \nAn explosion sparks from Bakugou\u2019s clenched fist. \n\u201cKatsuki?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna fucking kill her.\u201d \n\u2014\nIf nothing else, the years have made them efficient. Into hero costumes, to the scene of a crime, in pursuit of a villain\u2014all within a blurred series of moments. Bakugou\u2019s head aches as he experiences a strange sort of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, following the same villain through the city, down to the docks, and into an old warehouse. \nJust before they head inside, Kirishima grabs Bakugou\u2019s elbow and pulls him aside. \n\u201cWhy are you wasting time?\u201d Bakugou snaps. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lose her!\u201d\n\u201cJust hold on a second,\u201d Kirishima says patiently. \u201cI wanted to tell you something, before we go.\u201d\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Bakugou says, voice high and strained.\nKirishima steps forward and embraces him, resting his chin against Bakugou\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI can\u2019t tell what you must be thinking, about all of this. But if we get you home, I don\u2019t want you going back thinking that your life is unhappy.\u201d \n\u201cShut up,\u201d Bakugou says weakly, \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJust, listen. You\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me, Katsuki. Don\u2019t forget that, okay? I love that you need me, but I need you, too. Okay?\u201d\nThe words wash over him like salt water\u2014almost familiar, but leaving him feeling gritty and cold rather than clean and refreshed. \n\u201cFine,\u201d he says, eventually. \u201cLet\u2019s just go.\u201d\nKirishima presses a kiss to his forehead. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go.\u201d \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Kirishima asks a moment later, when they\u2019ve rejoined Deku. His Quirk ripples across his skin as his arms harden into weapons. \n\u201cNormally I\u2019d say capture and restrain, but I\u2019m not the one who knew about this ahead of time.\u201d Deku turns to Bakugou with questioning eyes. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d \nBakugou isn\u2019t sure how much Deku knows\u2014how much his older self deigned to share with him. But if the time villain really is here, this may be his only chance to get home. He doesn\u2019t have a single moment to waste. \n\u201cGet me close to her,\u201d he growls out. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d \nMaybe it speaks to a trust that\u2019s built up between them all over the many years, or maybe Kirishima and Deku have always had this sort of faith in Bakugou. Either way, they both nod, flanking him on either side as they enter the warehouse. \nThe instant they step foot inside, all of the lights in the warehouse turn on, flooding Bakugou\u2019s vision. For a few, crucial moments, he can\u2019t see anything. Then, just before his eyes adjust, he hears a familiar, mocking laugh just behind him.\n\u201cMy, my,\u201d the villain says. \u201cThey really sent out the big guns just for me, didn\u2019t they?\u201d \nBakugou whips around to see behind him, an explosion sparking from his palm as he tries to reach out and catch her. But she laughs and blinks away, using the same sort of teleportation she had days or years ago. \n\u201cTeleporting,\u201d Deku mutters, leaping back but keeping his eyes trained on her. \u201cGuys, if she\u2019s moving like that we have to think one step ahead\u2014\u201d\nShe reappears right in front of Deku, arm lifted to strike him with the flat of her palm. Deku moves with fluid grace, dropping into a crouch to avoid the hit. She laughs as he dodges, blinking out of view and then reappearing just behind him. But again, Deku avoids the hit, jumping up with the force of his borrowed Quirk. \n\u201cLet\u2019s go, while she\u2019s distracted,\u201d Kirishima mutters to Bakugou. He doesn\u2019t even wait for a response before rushing in. While Deku holds the villain\u2019s attention, Kirishima rushes in and grabs her from behind, pinning her arms to her sides as she struggles against him. \n\u201cWait,\u201d Bakugou calls out, his mind struggling to fit all the memories together. But before he can finish the thought, both Kirishima and the villain blink out of view. \n\u201cShit.\u201d Bakugou whirls around, searching for any sign of them. \nThey both reappear across the space of the warehouse, on top of a pile of wooden storage crates. Kirishima struggles to keep a grip on the villain as she ducks down and kicks out as his ankles. He plants his feet, but the wooden crates aren\u2019t stable and even from across the room Bakugou can hear the wood splintering. \n\u201cHurry up, Deku,\u201d he hisses, already preparing to launch himself across the room, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get over there.\u201d \nHe tries to adjust for the strength of his Quirk, to modulate the explosion as he blasts himself through the air and towards Kirishima. But he hasn\u2019t had any time to practice with this body and its new abilities. He still ends up going faster than he anticipates, off-center as he collides with the villain and sends them both flying into the opposite wall. \nThe villain lets out a hiss of pain as she takes the hit, her head slamming back against the wall. The impact dislodges her mask, revealing a pair of deep blue eyes. She looks at Bakugou and shakes her head. \n\u201c\u2026oh,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d \nBakugou doesn\u2019t think, just slams his palm over her face to hold her down.\n\u201cFix this,\u201d he hisses, voice wild and crackling like a forest fire, \u201cFix this before I blow your goddamn head off!\u201d \n\u201cShould I?\u201d she asks, voice muffled. She laughs shakily, seemingly unintimidated by the living bomb pressed against her head. \u201cI wonder, have you learned your lesson at all?\u201d \nBakugou tightens his grip, lets his palm heat up so that she\u2019ll be able to feel it. \u201cStop fucking with me\u2014send me back, now!\u201d \nShe laughs, again, and Bakugou hears the thud-thud-thud of footsteps behind him, a voice calling out to him, just before the villain reaches out with her other hand and grabs the bare part of his arm.\nJust like last time, her touch burns like fire. Bakugou feels himself being ripped apart and reassembled, and then he\u2019s falling through the air again, the villain kicking herself away from him so that she can land on her feet. Bakugou falls into a crumpled heap beside her, his head slamming against the concrete floor of the warehouse. \n\u201cKatsuki!\u201d \nKirishima is racing towards them, but Bakugou\u2019s head is ringing and he can\u2019t see straight. He sees a flash of green that must be Deku, then the white and black of the villain\u2019s costume. She\u2019s dancing around both of them, red and green, and Bakugou\u2019s head is pounding in rhythm to thrown punches and the subtle dance of the fight. \nHave you learned your lesson at all?\nWhat the fuck was he supposed to be learning? All his time here has been miserable, because it\u2019s a future he\u2019s never going to be able to have. Even if he gets home, if he remembers this, it\u2019s going to be a weight he\u2019ll have to carry. Because he\u2019s already fucked up with Kirishima, hasn\u2019t he? He\u2019s already lost the opportunity for this life. \nKirishima and Deku are trying to pin her down, but they\u2019re not having much success. It\u2019s like she knows where they\u2019re going to be, can dodge out of the way even before they move to catch her. \n\u201cKatsuki!\u201d \nHe\u2019s barely brought himself up to his hands and knees when he hears Kirishima\u2019s voice, looks up to see the villain poised over him. She\u2019s extending a hand, an unreadable glint in her dark eyes. She\u2019s smiling, and Bakugou shivers. \n\u201cAs fun as it would be to keep you around,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m going to need all my strength to get out of here.\u201d \nBakugou hisses out a curse, but he\u2019s too slow to dodge. She barely presses the tips of her fingers to his cheek, but it\u2019s enough. The same burning sensation spreads over his face, then down his arms and across his chest.\nHe looks up, and the last thing he sees is Kirishima racing towards him. He\u2019s yelling something, reaching for Bakugou, but he\u2019s not going to make it in time. \nBakugou is going to miss him, he realizes. He hopes that, if the other Bakugou makes it back here, he takes care of Kirishima like he deserves.\nAs soon as he\u2019s had that thought, the world goes dark around him.\n\u2014\n\u201cWake up, wake up, please wake up!\u201d\nSomeone is holding him. It\u2019s a foreign sensation. His body hasn\u2019t been held like this, before. There\u2019s a strong arm wrapped around his shoulders, pressing him close against someone\u2019s chest. The same person is clutching his hand, whispering desperately to him. \nBut he\u2019s tired, and he hurts, and it\u2019s too much effort to open his eyes, just yet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use,\u201d a voice calls out. Deku. \u201cShe\u2019s gone, Riot.\u201d \n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Kirishima asks, his voice watery. Something wet hits Bakugou\u2019s cheek. \u201cWe need to call someone\u2014do something\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou need to shut up,\u201d Bakugou grouses, each word almost painful as he forces it out.\nHe blinks open his eyes slowly, and just before Kirishima comes into view Bakugou feels the grip on his shoulders tighten. \n\u201cBakugou!\u201d\n\u201cKacchan, you\u2019re okay!\u201d \nBakugou shrugs Kirishima off of him and shoots a glare at Deku. \u201cFucking obviously. Did I hear that right? You useless shits let her get away?\u201d \n\u201cWe got a bit distracted,\u201d Deku says, scratching the back of his head. \n\u201cBy what?\u201d Bakugou rises slowly to his feet, pushing himself up even though every joint in his body feels sore. The back of his head aches. But as he takes slow assessment, he realizes he\u2019s back together\u2014in the right time, in a body that\u2019s sixteen years old, in the same warehouse with Kirishima and Deku. \n\u201cYou scared the hell out of me,\u201d Kirishima says in a rush, grabbing Bakugou\u2019s shoulders and turning him around. \u201cDon\u2019t do that, man!\u201d \nKirishima\u2019s spiky hair is mussed over the headpiece of his costume, and his face is pale. He looks at Bakugou with intensity and worry. In that moment, it\u2019s very easy to forget why he\u2019d been so mad at Kirishima, earlier. \nTo be honest, it was never Kirishima he was mad at.\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Bakugou says, with no heat behind it. \u201cWhat even happened?\u201d \n\u201cYou were screaming, Kacchan,\u201d Deku says quietly. His voice starts out shaky, like he\u2019d been distressed, too. But then he reigns himself in. \u201cAnd then you went completely cold. The villain disappeared.\u201d \n\u201cWe thought she\u2019d killed you,\u201d Kirishima says, voice strangled. \u201cI came up on you and you were just lying there, nothing I did would make you respond and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFuck that,\u201d Bakugou scoffs. \u201cYou think someone like that was enough to take care of me? You should know better than that.\u201d \nKirishima takes a step back, then gives Bakugou a flat look. \u201cI was worried about you.\u201d \nIn that moment, Bakugou can see echoes of an older man in Kirishima\u2019s face\u2014his expression is exactly the same as his older self\u2019s, looking at Bakugou with exasperation and concern and affection lurking somewhere beneath the scolding. Bakugou swallows reflexively, as though that will keep his emotions held in the pit of his stomach and away from his heart and throat, where they might escape into the world. \nHe is back, isn\u2019t he? This is almost the same moment that he\u2019d left from. It\u2019s like nothing happened at all. \nHe clenches his fists and steps away from Kirishima. \n\u201cCome on, you useless idiots,\u201d he says, suddenly very tired. \u201cLet\u2019s go file a report, or some shit. What a fucking waste.\u201d \n\u2014\nKirishima and Deku insist that he go to the infirmary, no matter how many times Bakugou says that he\u2019s fine. Recovery Girl looks him over, clicking her tongue against her teeth as she decides his bruises and cuts don\u2019t warrant the attention of her Quirk. Bakugou shoots an I-told-you-so look at Deku, but Deku just shrugs. Bakugou knows what the fucking nerd is thinking\u2014that it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry, that he and Kirishima were so worried. But Bakugou doesn\u2019t need anyone to worry about him. He just needs time to think.\nAizawa is waiting outside of the infirmary when Bakugou leaves. He\u2019s frowning, the deep cut of his eyebrows over his eyes obscured by his messy hair. But then he stands up a bit straighter, and his hair is pushed back from his face as his eyes flash red.\nBakugou hates it when Aizawa uses his Quirk. Now, he can feel the exact moment when his own blinks out of existence, leaving him vulnerable and powerless for just a moment. Then, the sensation fades, and Aizawa is still looking at him searchingly. \n\u201cYou\u2019re sure she didn\u2019t hit you with anything?\u201d Aizawa asks, tone for once insistent rather than bored. \nBakugou shakes his head. He doesn\u2019t know the exact parameters of Aizawa\u2019s Quirk\u2014whether he can sense when one has been used, and sees the remnants of the villain\u2019s hanging over Bakugou. Even if he could see that, there\u2019s nothing left to erase. Bakugou is back where he belongs.\nStill, once again, he sees an echo around Aizawa\u2014his older self, with gray hair and even more tired eyes. For a moment, Bakugou almost laughs, almost tells Aizawa that he\u2019s going to be stuck at fucking Yuuei for the rest of his life. \nBut that would mean admitting to things that Bakugou hasn\u2019t fully processed, yet. Instead, he just rolls his eyes at Aizawa and asks, \u201cCan I go, now?\u201d \nAizawa waves him off, and Bakugou is finally able to retreat back to his dorm to be alone with his thoughts.\n\u2014\nBakugou lies on his back in bed, dressed in loose sweats and a t-shirt. He\u2019s been in the same position for hours, staring at the ceiling and willing the world to tilt back on its axis, to where it had been this morning. \nBut it won\u2019t go back. Every time he closes his eyes, Bakugou sees the future. He sees Deku as a powerful hero, sees Todoroki call him a friend, sees a gaggle of children calling him sensei. He sees a home made by two people, and the glint of golden rings. He sees Kirishima, smiling at him and kissing him and worrying over him. \nYou don\u2019t like anything about your life?\nBut that\u2019s not it. He didn\u2019t dislike that life. Bakugou holds a pillow to his chest, turning over onto his side and digging his fingers into the soft fabric. He didn\u2019t hate it. And that\u2019s the whole fucking problem. \nBakugou isn\u2019t always blind to his own emotions. He knows when things are getting to be too much, usually, even when he doesn\u2019t know what to do about that. So, weeks and months ago, when he\u2019d first started to recognize what he was feeling for Kirishima, he\u2019d come to a decision. \nIf he never let those feelings out, never admitted to them, then they couldn\u2019t destabilize him. Kirishima couldn\u2019t become something he could lose, because he would never let himself have Kirishima in the first place. That way, he could keep focusing on his own life, on being the world\u2019s greatest hero, on overcoming every obstacle in his path. \nBut now, when Bakugou imagines the obstacles in front of him, he just sees his elder self. He\u2019s standing with his feet planted and his arms crossed over his chest, and he\u2019s looking at Bakugou with challenging eyes. \nWhat are you so scared of? \n\u201cFucking hell.\u201d Bakugou rips into the pillow, letting off two small explosions from his palms. The pillow bursts, and white fluff falls all around the room like snow. In a matter of seconds, Bakugou is covered in the stuff. \u201cI\u2019m not scared!\u201d \nIf all of this is a contest, or a game, with multiple outcomes\u2014then he needs to be able to get what he wants. He needs to be able to win. \nHe\u2019s not exactly sure how to do that, yet. He\u2019s not sure how sixteen-year-old Bakugou Katsuki becomes that man who exists in the future, with all of the changes and successes and failures and relationships. He doesn\u2019t know. \nBut he doesn\u2019t have enough faith in the future to think that it will fall into place on its own. There\u2019s only one thing he believes in that much, and that\u2019s himself.\n\u2014\nAfter the fifth time Bakugou kicks Kirishima\u2019s door, he finally answers. He looks like he\u2019d just gotten back from the showers\u2014his hair\u2019s still damp, loose around his face, and he\u2019s wearing pajamas. When he sees Bakugou, his eyes go wide and round. \n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cYou like me,\u201d Bakugou says flatly, accusingly. It isn\u2019t a question.\nKirishima frowns, then looks simply sad. \u201cLook, Bakugou\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d Bakugou says, jabbing a finger at him. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you called me, when that villain grabbed me.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2014what?\u201d Kirishima tries to remember. Then his cheeks turn pink. \u201cHey, that was\u2014a mistake, or something. I was really freaked out, okay?\u201d \n\u201cBecause you like me,\u201d Bakugou tells him. \nKirishima frowns. \u201cWhy do you keep saying it, like that? Look, I get that you didn\u2019t want to return my feelings, but don\u2019t be an asshole about it. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d\u2014\u201d\nBakugou grabs him by the collar and drags him forward. For a second, Kirishima looks apprehensive. Then, as he realizes what\u2019s about to happen, he smiles.\nThis is no practiced kiss between lovers who have spent a life together. It\u2019s messy and off-center\u2014Kirishima\u2019s teeth catch on Bakugou\u2019s lower lip, and neither of them have any idea where to put their tongues. But Bakugou keeps pressing into it, keeps kissing Kirishima with the certainty of someone who knows they\u2019ll have enough time to become an expert. \nFinally, Kirishima pulls back, gasping for breath. \u201cKatsuki,\u201d he says, \u201cWhat the hell.\u201d \nBakugou doesn\u2019t step back. He looks at Kirishima with a steady gaze, and then says, \u201cI want you.\u201d \nKirishima\u2019s cheeks go from pink to red. But Bakugou isn\u2019t done. \n\u201cI want you,\u201d he repeats, words hot and defiant. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m going to do whatever it fucking takes to be the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to you.\u201d \nIt\u2019s always been a philosophy he\u2019s followed\u2014anything in life worth doing is worth doing well. And so even if he doesn\u2019t know how to change, yet, he\u2019s damn well going to try. At least in one future, he knows he\u2019ll succeed. \nKirishima laughs, bright and happy, before he reaches out and tugs Bakugou into his room. And Bakugou grins fiercely, because he\u2019s the one who put that smile on Kirishima\u2019s face. \n\u2014\nA dozen years in the future, Bakugou wakes up with a headache. \n\u201cFuck,\u201d he says, clutching the back of his head. \u201cAm I drunk?\u201d \nLeaning over him, Kirishima arches a brow. \u201cNot that I know of.\u201d He reaches out and grabs Bakugou\u2019s hand, hoisting him to his feet. \u201cSo, were you going to tell me about the time travelling bullshit, or was this all some weird anniversary surprise?\u201d \nSomewhere behind him, he hears Deku chuckle. \n\u201cShut the fuck up, nerd,\u201d he says, on reflex. Then he turns to Kirishima and has the good sense to feel sheepish. \u201cI don\u2019t know how fucking time travel works, okay. I just figured making as much of a loop as possible was the best bet.\u201d \nKirishima pouts at him, then shakes his head. \u201cYou know, babe, you can be really smart and really stupid at the same time.\u201d \nBakugou elbows him. \u201cYou\u2019re the idiot who\u2019s stuck around so long.\u201d\nKirishima laughs and slings an arm around Bakugou\u2019s shoulders. He leans against him, pressing a kiss against his temple. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty good deal, so far.\u201d \nEven after years, Bakugou feels the familiar stirrings of affection when he looks at Kirishima. He leans in and kisses his husband soundly on the lips, angling his face just-so to avoid the metal of Kirishima\u2019s headpiece. He manages it perfectly, after years of practice. \nBehind them, Deku says, \u201cAs much as I don\u2019t want to interrupt, Kacchan\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThen why are you fucking interrupting, Deku?\u201d\nDeku mutters something under his breath, but continues, \u201cIsn\u2019t there a party we should be getting back to?\u201d \nBakugou groans. \u201cHow did I not manage to miss that.\u201d \nKirishima grins and grabs for Bakugou\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t whine so much. After everything we\u2019ve been through today, I think you might actually have fun at the party.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like I just got run over by a truck, I don\u2019t want to go to a party,\u201d Bakugou starts, but Kirishima is already tugging him along. \u201cWait\u2014what happened to that villain? The time Quirk?\u201d \nDeku frowns severely. \u201cShe vanished completely. I put out a city-wide alert, but there\u2019s no sign of her.\u201d \nKirishima stops and looks at Bakugou. \u201cDo you want to go after her?\u201d\nBakugou hesitates for only a moment. Then he tugs on Kirishima\u2019s hand, and shakes his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll get her eventually,\u201d he decides. \u201cC\u2019mon. Let\u2019s go get this stupid party over with.\u201d \nKirishima laughs, leaning against Bakugou as they walk. Hand in hand, they walk towards the future. \n\u2014\n\nif at some point we all succumb\n\nfor goodness sake, let us be young\n\n\u2018cause time gets harder to outrun\n\nand i\u2019m nobody, i\u2019m not done\n\nwith a cool, cool breeze and dirty knees\n\ni rest on childhood memories\n\nwe all got old at breakneck speed\n\nslow it down, go easy on me\n"
