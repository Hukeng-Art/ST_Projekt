    "notes": "<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">notes</a> and <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>Falls to the floor in exhaustion, crawls to the shore. *my watch has ended*</p>\n<p>Oh my God, that fic took a thousand years to write. It got to the point where I was literally yelling, \u201cWHY WONT YOU FUCKING END! END! END! END!\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay, so this fic has been 75% written since, like, before the hiatus\u2014I just couldn\u2019t handle the grocery store scene and couldn\u2019t believe no one talked about it? HOW? So y\u2019all got some indulgent angst fic as a result. I had to slow burn as much as I could because I\u2019m a masochist. I live for the Buddie slowburn. </p>\n<p>I hope you guys like this fic! I\u2019m always iffy about OCs so I\u2019m really iffy about Cole but I needed someone who didn\u2019t know anyone else in 118, and who was just Buck\u2019s. The backstory dump was...well I thought it was important so I kept it in bc it was short anyway even though I hate backstory dumps and it fucks with my pacing. If things feel a little out of character, it may be because I pulled a few things out of an original story of mine that's been sitting on my desktop for YEARS though I only used the material because of how closely Buddie reflected my characters (isn't it funny? Most people adapt their fanfics for their original works, and I do the opposite hehe oh well at least this way it's not gathering virtual dust).</p>\n<p>Also\u2014how nice of the show runners to confirm Eddie is a bad cook for me. Now if they could confirm literally the rest of my story, that\u2019d be s\u2019well. </p>\n<p>I have another fic idea for these guys (or several), but I have a ton of Tarlos ideas too for 911 Lone Star and I need to get at least one of those ones done AND finish my Little Women fic first. </p>\n<p>If any of you are Tarlos fans, here\u2019s a snippet of what is *likely* to be my next fic:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p> <i>\u201cThe thing is--the thing is, Carlos had always felt temporary. TK had wanted someone, and Carlos had been there, but his presence--his specific presence, and not just a male body to pass a few hours with--was, ultimately, negotiable. Convenient, yes; acceptable, yes; but never, ever critical. So he\u2019d known that his time was limited. Known it the first time TK had walked out of his apartment without a backwards glance. Heard the ticking of the countdown the moment TK had said, \u201cmy ex just texted me,\u201d then louder again when he said, \u201cmy ex is in town.\u201d He\u2019s not sure why it hurt so much to hear \u201cI\u2019m getting back with my ex\u201d now, except that it does.</i></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p> <i>He\u2019d hoped. He\u2019d known better, and he\u2019d hoped.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I know, I know. Don\u2019t come at me. I live for angst. All the angst. (In this scenario, they were strictly fwb/casual).</p>\n<p>As a final note--I still can't figure out how AO3 and HTML works. I apologize for the thousand of relationship tags because I couldn't originally find the Buck/Eddie one when I went to post this story. </p>\n<p>If anyone sees anything triggering that they would like tagged, please let me know and I will update the tags.</p>\n<p>Title is from the e.e.cummings poem, although it was also very much inspired by the other e.e.cummings poem, \"you are tired (i think)\". I'll be honest though, that poem has inspired a lot of fics for me. Angstangstangst.</p>",
    "text": "Sometimes, Buck wakes up drowning. Sometimes, Buck wakes up with a crushing weight on top of him and an empty feeling inside him and he can\u2019t\u2014get\u2014free. And for all the times in between, he wakes up, terrified out of his skin with no reason why. \nThis is one of those nights. \nHe shoots out of bed and scrambles for the light, patting himself down\u2014both arms, both legs, no blood, no holes. He\u2019s fine, he\u2019s fine, he\u2019s fine, he\u2019s fine. \nIt takes a while, of him clutching at his chest, of his heart hammering out of his ribs, of his lungs caving in on themselves, before he realizes: he\u2019s fine.\nChristopher Diaz is at home. Safe.\nThere\u2019s no truck. No waves. No clots. No bombs. \nJust him. Evan Buckley. In his bed. In his room. Making an idiot of himself at four in the morning. \nIt\u2019s too early for his shift. Too late for sleep.\n***\nBuck has never been one for cardio. Yes, he runs, but he\u2019s never been a runner.\nUntil now. \nIf he runs long enough, and hard enough, and fast enough, his brain shuts down. His thoughts narrow down to the ache in his thighs, the burning in his lungs, and the constant chant of, \u201cGod, when will this be over?\u201d\nHe\u2019s sure someone out there will have something to say about this particular coping mechanism. He knows it\u2019s not exactly healthy (or safe), but it\u2019s what he has. \nOn the other side of the park, another man is running the same route. Buck sees him some nights, pace steady but determined. \nBuck wonders if he\u2019s running from his head too. \n***\n\u201cLook, look,\u201d Buck says at lunch, \u201cI\u2019m just saying, it\u2019s possible that a ghost called 911.\u201d \nThere is a collective groan from everyone around the table. \n\u201cNot this again,\u201d Hen groans. \n\u201cBuck,\u201d Bobby says slowly, like he\u2019s talking to a child, \u201cwe\u2019ve talked about this before, remember? Ghosts do not exist. They do not call 911.\u201d \n\u201cHow do you know, have you met one?\u201d \nThere is a beat. \n\u201cNo. No, I have not, because they don\u2019t exist.\u201d \n\u201cNo, people just haven\u2019t discovered them yet. It\u2019s different.\u201d Next to him, Eddie moves Buck\u2019s glass of water out of reach so he doesn\u2019t knock it over with his hand gestures. \u201cRussel Hoang was at home, alone, when he fell. His phone was across the room, out of reach. Someone called 911 for him. What if, maybe, it was his dead wife\u2019s ghost?\u201d \nThere is another beat as the crew looks around, then Eddie says, \u201che has a point, Cap.\u201d \n\u201cAlright,\u201d Bobby declares, \u201cagree to disagree, Buck.\u201d \nBuck claps. \u201cYes.\u201d \n\u201cAnd you are on dish duty.\u201d \n\u201cAw, man.\u201d \nEddie laughs and pats his back, making Buck grin and say to Bobby, \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna need some help, Cap.\u201d\n\u201cEddie can help you.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re the worst,\u201d Eddie groans.\nBuck laughs and, watching him, Eddie\u2019s glare slowly softens into a smile. Buck\u2019s heart does something strange and he bites his lips, turning back to his lunch. \n\u201cYou want to come over tonight?\u201d Eddie asks later, gently nudging Buck away from the sink so he could take over the washing. Allegedly -- emphasis on the allegedly -- Buck makes too much of a mess when he\u2019s washing dishes and speaking at the same time. \n\u201cDepends, you gonna make me clean your kitchen as payback?\u201d \n\u201cWell, now that you mention it, that\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201d Eddie grins. \u201cChris just got a new Lego set and he asked if you would come over to play with him. Seeing as how you two are pretty much the same age\u2026\u201d \nBuck rolls his eyes. \u201cVery funny. I\u2019ll have you know Legos are a perfectly good pastime for people of all ages.\u201d \n\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Eddie says, still smiling. \u201cSo? You want to come over? I\u2019ll get us some pizza.\u201d \nAny night he doesn\u2019t have to spend in his own company is a good night. A night with the Diaz boys is absolutely the best night. \n\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d \n***\nBuck doesn\u2019t think that if he were to say, \u201cI\u2019m in a bad place\u201d, that anyone would turn him away. Really, he doesn\u2019t. The 118 has too many good, kind people for that. \nBut every time he wants to open his mouth, to say something, to reach out to Eddie or Bobby or Hen or Chim, he hears Eddie yelling, \u201cyou\u2019re exhausting.\u201d \n\u2014you\u2019re exhausting, you\u2019re exhausting, you\u2019re exhausting\u2014\nSo each day he does his job and he laughs and he jokes and he pretends he\u2019s the care-free goofball he\u2019s always been. And each day he packs away his bruises and his worries, takes them home to his empty loft with its quiet rooms, and licks his wounds in silence.\n***\n\u201cBUCK!\u201d \nBuck laughs and lifts the little ball of energy in his arms. \u201cHey, Superman. Did you miss me?\u201d \n\u201cOf course he did,\u201d Eddie answers for his son, rolling his eyes. \u201cHe barely even looked up when I came in.\u201d \nChris groans and rolls his eyes. \u201cI was watching Spiderman, dad.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, Eddie,\u201d Buck goads, \u201che was watching Spiderman.\u201d \nEddie rolls his eyes again and claps him on the back. \u201cCome on in, pizza\u2019s almost here.\u201d \nChris cheers, kicking his legs, which Buck takes as indication that he wants to be released. \n\u201cCan Buck and I play with my Legos?\u201d Chris asks, picking up one of his crutches and grabbing onto Buck\u2019s hand. Buck picks up his other crutch and lets himself be led into the kitchen.\n\u201cAfter dinner, if you\u2019ve finished your homework, maybe.\u201d \n\u201cAw, dad.\u201d \nBuck leans down. \u201cCome on, Superman. I bet that homework is a piece of cake for you. Get it done quickly, and I\u2019ll talk your dad around.\u201d \nChris throws his head back in exasperation and pivots to where his homework is spread out in the living room, groaning all the way. \n\u201cHe learned that from you,\u201d Eddie tells him. \n\u201cDid not,\u201d Buck says, even though he probably, totally, did. \u201cYou need help with that salad?\u201d \n\u201cNah, but you can set the table.\u201d \nBuck had never thought small, domestic things like helping with a salad or setting a table would be anything other than tedious. But here, now, in Eddie\u2019s house, setting the table feels like a privilege. Like he\u2019s being allowed in their home as part of the family. There was a time, after the lawsuit, he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d get to have this again.\n\u201cYou alright?\u201d \nI don\u2019t know, he wants to say, but I\u2019m better when I\u2019m with you. \n\n(you\u2019re exhausting) \n\nBuck forces a grin. \u201cYeah, as long as you promise we get to play with Legos after dinner.\u201d \n\u201cDios, you\u2019re worse than he is.\u201d\nBuck stays and plays with Chris until Eddie forces his son into bed. Then stays until he\u2019s read Chris enough stories to have Eddie dragging him out of the room. Then stays and nurses a beer until it\u2019s gone warm. \nEddie yawns. \n\u201cSorry, I\u2019ll get out of your hair.\u201d \nEddie shakes his head and nods at the bottle in Buck\u2019s hand. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even finished your beer.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he says, dumps the drink down the sink. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t realize it was so late.\u201d \n\u201cHey,\u201d Eddie says gently, \u201cI like spending time with you and you\u2019re always welcome here.\u201d \n\u201cThanks, Eddie.\u201d Buck says, meaning the words more than Eddie knows, then forces himself to put on his jacket and walk away. \nMaybe it won\u2019t be so bad tonight. \n***\n\u201cWhere did you serve?\u201d\nThe other runner\u2019s name is Cole Terrence. He looks around Bobby\u2019s age, and has an open, easy personality that calms Buck\u2019s nerves. \n\u201cServe?\u201d Buck blinks at him. \u201cOh--Oh, no, no, no. I\u2019m not a, uh,\u2014\u201d\nThe other man raises his hands. \u201cSorry, when I see someone running at 3 in the morning like the devil\u2019s running after them, I assume they\u2019ve seen action.\u201d \n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Buck shakes his head, \u201cjust can\u2019t sleep.\u201d \nCole narrows his eyes and Buck resists shifting on his feet the way he sometimes does when Bobby is sizing him up. \u201cWhat do you do, son?\u201d \nBuck beams. \u201cI\u2019m a firefighter.\u201d \n\u201cAh,\u201d Cole says, nodding, like something\u2019s become clear to him now. \nThere\u2019s something in the tone, in the look, that has Buck\u2019s smile sliding off his face. \n***\nBuck stares at the scene in front of him, lips parted, eyes wide.\n\u201cBuck.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, Cap?\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t. Laugh.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d \nHe can hear snickers in his earpiece and swallows against the urge to burst out laughing himself. \n\u201cWhat are you guys doing? Help me.\u201d \n\u201cCaptain?\u201d Bucky says very, very slowly. \n\u201cYes, Buck?\u201d \n\u201cPermission to go inside the truck and laugh.\u201d \n\u201cPermission granted.\u201d \nBuck practically runs to the back of the truck, bursting into a fit of laughter as soon as he\u2019s cleared. \n\u201cOh my God,\u201d Eddie gasps. \n\u201cHe\u2019s--he\u2019s--\u201d Buck collapses against Chimney, clutching his stomach. \u201c--he\u2019s--\u201d \n\u201cAlright everyone,\u201d crackles Bobby\u2019s voice, \u201csettle down. Buck I\u2019m going to need your help out here.\u201d \n\u201cOkay--okay--\u201d he takes a deep breath, and clears his throat, \u201c--okay--I\u2019m--\u201d \nHis eyes lock on Eddie\u2019s and immediately the two men start snickering again, leaning on each other to hold themselves up. \n\u201cBuck.\u201d \n\u201cComing.\u201d \nThe man glares the whole time Buck is treating him, which Buck thinks is fair enough. \n\u201cAre you in any pain or discomfort right now, sir?\u201d \n\u201cHe said it would make my greatest wish come true,\u201d the man says instead. \n\u201cWell.\" Buck shrugs. \"That might still happen.\u201d Hey, anything is possible. \n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine wanting anything that badly.\u201d Chimney says at the end of their shift. \n\u201cI can,\u201d Hen says, \u201cif someone tells me to dye myself purple, put on a donkey suit, and serenade some snakes, and I\u2019ll have a baby, I\u2019m there in a heartbeat.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m with Chim,\u201d Eddie says, \u201cyou can\u2019t just rely on miracles for the things you want. You gotta work for them. Otherwise, what\u2019s the point?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d do it.\u201d\nChim rolls his eyes. \u201cYes, we all know you\u2019d do it, Buck. You probably wouldn\u2019t even ask for a wish before doing something like that.\u201d \n\u201cWhat would you wish for?\u201d Eddie asks. \nBuck, who\u2019d been frowning at Chim\u2019s comment, shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Six months ago, I would have said just to be back here. Now, I guess I have everything I\u2019d wish for.\u201d \nChim scoffs and the conversation pivots to what everyone would wish for. \n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you want that you\u2019d make a wish for?\u201d Eddie presses again. \u201cNot money, or a yacht, or--\u201d \n\u201cNope.\u201d Buck grins. \u201cI am perfectly happy.\u201d \nBobby wishes they would all just shut up and go home. \n***\nBuck wishes he hadn\u2019t filed the lawsuit. He wishes he\u2019d been there for Eddie and Chris when they needed him.\nHe wishes he had someone else\u2019s body. One that worked properly and didn\u2019t have screws in its leg, and a few screws loose in its head. \nBuck wishes his parents had been better. He wishes they\u2019d loved him and Maddie. He wishes he hadn\u2019t had to teach himself how to be, how to feel. He wishes they\u2019d taught him how to love a normal amount so the people he loved wouldn\u2019t become so unbearably indispensable to him. \nHe wishes someone would keep him. \nHe wishes he could sleep. \nHe wishes. \n***\n\u201cThere was this kid,\u201d Buck says, an untouched coffee cooling in front of him, \u201che blew up my truck, and--and I was trapped under it--\u201d\nCole sits back in his seat. \u201cYou\u2019re that firefighter.\u201d \nBuck nods and swallows. \u201cGuess it made the news.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s an understatement,\u201d Cole scoffs. \u201cBut then, it\u2019d be understandable, why your job would be hard after that--\u201d \n\u201c--No, no,\u201d Buck shakes his head. \u201cMy job is the only thing that isn\u2019t hard.\u201d \nCole says nothing, and Buck licks his lips, sitting up and putting his elbows on the table. He tells him everything, about the blood clot, the tsunami, the terror of losing Chris in the chaos that followed, and the lawsuit that was the icing on the cake. \nWhen he\u2019s finished, Cole sits back, stunned. \u201cWow.\u201d \n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n***\nAs a rule, Buck lets Eddie win when they\u2019re playing video games. Usually, they only play video games when Chris is there, and cheering his father on, so Buck is happy to take a bit of teasing from his best friend for his almost spectacular losing streak, if it means both the Diaz boys smile like that. Eddie is so naturally good at everything he does, no one else thinks to question it. No one, that is, except for Denny Wilson. \n\u201cYou\u2019re letting him win,\u201d Denny accuses one day. \nBuck freezes, and everyone gathered around the pair in Eddie\u2019s living room, turns to look at him. \nBuck glances at Eddie then back to Denny and forces a chuckle. \u201cUh, no, buddy, Eddie won, fair and square.\u201d \n\u201cNo,\u201d Danny glares, \u201cyou let him win. You could have beat him at the beginning with that move you taught me the other day. Remember, the one with the lava.\u201d \nBuck casts a look at Hen, help. \nFighting back a smile, she reaches for their controllers, handing one to Karen. \u201cBoth of these boys are terrible at this game. Let\u2019s show \u2018em how it\u2019s done, honey.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ll get some more snacks,\u201d Buck blurts, practically running into the kitchen.\nHe feels, more than sees, Eddie follow him. \n\u201cDo you think we have any more of those cookies Karen made?\u201d Buck asks, riffling through the cupboards, and wincing at his use of the word \u2018we\u2019. \u201cOr did I eat them all?\u201d \n\u201cBuck, have you been letting me win so I\u2019d look cool in front of my kid?\u201d \nBuck turns slowly and makes a face. \u201cNo?\u201d \nEddie crosses his arms. \u201cSo all this time, me winning the title\u2026\u201d \nBuck makes another face. \u201cSorry?\u201d \nEddie rolls his eyes but he\u2019s smiling. \u201cYou know what this means, don\u2019t you?\u201d \n\u201cUh--\u201d \nEddie steps closer, until there isn\u2019t much separating the two of them. \u201cIt means we\u2019re going to go again until I prove I can take you.\u201d \nBuck swallows--don\u2019t say anything inappropriate, he chants. \u201cRight,\u201d he says, swallowing again and licks his lips. \nHe thinks he sees Eddie\u2019s eyes flicker to his lips, but then he\u2019s gone and Buck\u2019s sure he imagined it. \nThere\u2019s a boom of laughter from the living room and someone is calling for Buck to hurry up with the snacks and Buck feels lighter than he has in a while. \nLater, when Eddie has made him play round after round of the same video game, and Buck is yawning (and still managing to beat the other man), Eddie asks him if he wants to stay over. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll head in together.\u201d \n\u201cNah,\u201d Buck shakes his head, \u201cI got to feed my neighbour\u2019s cat.\u201d \nMaybe tonight won\u2019t be so bad. \n***\n\u201cHave you tried therapy?\u201d Cole asks.\nBuck cringes. \u201cYeah, uh, I tried that once. Before all of this. Didn\u2019t really work out for me.\u201d \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d \n\u201cShe, uh,\u201d He gives a breathless laugh, a self-deprecating smile. \u201cI had sex with her.\u201d\nCole\u2019s eyebrows shoot up, and Buck\u2019s face heats up. \n\u201cIt was a phase.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s not a phase, son. That\u2019s malpractice.\u201d \nBuck shrugs. \u201cYeah, well, she was treating me for sex addicition. Guess that, uh--\u201d \nHe doesn\u2019t get to finish because Cole had started sputtering. \u201cShe was treating you for sex addiction and she had sex with you?\u201d \n\u201cIt was just a phase,\u201d Buck says again, voice small. Buck 2.0 (3.0?) has come a long way and he\u2019s been trying so hard to be better. \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Cole insists. \u201cThat woman took advantage of you and her license should be revoked.\u201d\nWell, that\u2019s new. He hadn\u2019t thought about it that way. \u201cUh, I mean, she doesn\u2019t work for the department anymore.\u201d \nCole shakes his head. \u201cJesus, kid. You\u2019re a right mess, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \n\u201cI know,\u201d Buck says, eyes fixed on the table. He knows. \n\u201cHey.\u201d Buck looks up and Cole smiles at him kindly. \u201cMost people are. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d \n***\n\u201cChris\u2019s class wants to go to a waterpark,\u201d Eddie says the moment Buck answers his phone.\nBuck closes his fridge door, frowning. \u201cOkay?\u201d \n\u201cChris--he--he doesn\u2019t want to go because\u2014\u201d \nIt clicks. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid of water.\u201d Shit. \n\u201cYeah, because of the--\u201d \n\u201c--the tsunami, right.\u201d He shakes his head. That poor kid. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d \n\u201cI told him he doesn\u2019t have to go this time, if he doesn\u2019t want to, but he agreed to try coming to the pool with me today to see how he feels about water.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s great, Eddie. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d \nEddie lets out a breath. \u201cHe wants you there. With us. When we try. I know it\u2019s your day off today, and you\u2019re probably busy, but I was wondering--\u201d \n\u201cYes.\u201d \nThere\u2019s a pause. \u201cYeah?\u201d \n\u201cYes, Eddie, of course. You don\u2019t even have to ask.\u201d \n\u201cRight.\u201d There\u2019s something in his voice that Buck can\u2019t quite place, but it doesn\u2019t sound bad so Buck doesn\u2019t worry about it. \u201cWell, I was thinking, in like an hour? And then we can grab lunch, after?\u201d \n\u201cSure. Text me the address.\u201d \nWhen he gets to the parking lot, Chris is excited as always to see him, but his natural energy is noticeably subdued. Buck exchanges worried glances with Eddie before plastering a wide smile on his face and kneeling in front of Chris. \n\u201cYou ready to do this, bud?\u201d \n\u201cI guess.\u201d Chris says with a shrug. \n\u201cHey, your dad and I will be there the whole time, and you know I\u2019m a good swimmer, right?\u201d \n\u201cRight. You saved everyone.\u201d \nBuck smiles, swallowing a lump in his throat. He hadn\u2019t saved everyone. He had barely saved Chris. \n\u201cCome on, Chris,\u201d Eddie says, watching Buck carefully. \u201cLet\u2019s go get changed.\u201d \nIt takes more than a little coaxing from both men to get Chris into the water. In the end, they both get in the pool to prove that the water only comes up to their waist, before Chris is willing to risk it. \n\u201cYeah, Superman, you got this!\u201d Buck cheers, exchanging grins with Eddie over Chris\u2019s head. \u201cJust lay down and float and we\u2019ll be right here.\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t let go, okay?\u201d \n\u201cNever.\u201d\nThey walk the length of the pool with Chris floating between them, supporting his body with their hands.\n\u201cTurn back. It\u2019s too deep,\u201d Chris says, reaching up to trace where the water is now at his dad\u2019s chest. \n\u201cAw, but your dad\u2019s so short,\u201d Buck teases, \u201cof course the water is too deep for him.\u201d \nEddie glares, but there\u2019s no heat behind it, and Buck just grins back unrepentantly. \n\u201cHey, Chris,\u201d Eddie says, \u201cyou think you\u2019d be okay if we let go now?\u201d\nChris thinks about it. \u201cYou can let go. But not Buck.\u201d \n\u201cHey.\u201d \n\u201cSorry, Eds. Guess your kid knows I\u2019m the better swimmer.\u201d\n\u201cYou wanna\u2014\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, dad,\u201d Chris says, \u201cBuck can swim in a tsunami.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s right, buddy. You tell him.\u201d \nEddie rolls his eyes, but slowly, gently, lets go of Chris. \n\u201cBuck?\u201d Chris asks after a few minutes. \n\u201cYes?\u201d \n\u201cIs it okay if I still don\u2019t want to go on the class trip?\u201d \nBuck\u2019s eyes fly to Eddie. \u201cYeah, Superman, of course. Is the water still bothering you?\u201d \nThe boy nods, looking ashamed. \n\u201cHey, if you don\u2019t want to go\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI want to go. I\u2019m just...scared. I know it\u2019s stupid.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s never stupid to be scared. And you went through something very scary,\u201d Buck says, \u201cand it left a lot of people very scared. But I\u2019ll tell you what, if you want to go to the waterpark with your friends, I can bring you here as many times as you want til then until you feel okay to go. Would that be good?\u201d \nChris doesn\u2019t say anything, but sits up and wraps his arms around Buck. \u201cI love you, Buck.\u201d \nBuck hugs the kid close to him, blinking back tears. \u201cI love you too, Christopher.\u201d \nHe looks over at Eddie and sees him watching them, a tender, soft look on his face that makes Buck\u2019s heart hurt with what if.\n***\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to keep whining. I know you have your own problems.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re not whining. You experienced a lot of trauma in a very short time. You\u2019re processing.\u201d\n\u201cStill,\u201d Buck says, \u201cif you want to talk about anything, I\u2019ll listen, I promise.\u201d \n\u201cI know you will, kid.\u201d Cole sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you. And I\u2019ll tell you for one reason only. Because you don\u2019t think you're allowed to take, unless you\u2019ve given enough. So if you need to hear about my sad story to let me help, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d \nCole had been a high-ranking officer in the army, until a mission gone wrong 8 years ago. \n\u201cIn five minutes, everyone was dead. Except for me. They said I\u2019d never be able to walk again.\u201d He looks smug, tapping his legs, like, yeah, I showed those doctors. \u201cFor a long time after I came back, in the hospital, in therapy, I was angry. Angry and not coping well. I drank to the point of blacking out almost every night. I lashed out at my wife, at my doctors, at my friends...at my kids. Everyone who tried to reach out to me, I burned. Eventually, my wife couldn\u2019t do it anymore. The night she left, she got into a car accident. My wife, in critical condition, because she\u2019d been too upset to get into that car. My kids--they couldn't count on me and they knew they couldn\u2019t count me. \n\u201cThe next day, I threw out all the alcohol, went straight to the VA. Signed up for everything I could to straighten myself out. It was hard, but I did it, eventually. And my wife, thank God, she came out of it okay. And I fixed things with my family. I\u2019ve been sober 6 years now. Celebrating my 30th anniversary soon. One of my kids is starting med school in the fall. The other one is going to be president, one day.\u201d\nBuck smiles at Cole\u2019s proud grin. \u201cSo it turned out okay.\u201d \n\u201cEventually, it did.\u201d Cole takes a breath. \u201cI used to come out here and run myself ragged every night, until I was too exhausted for nightmares. Now, I do it as a habit and to remind myself of how close I was to losing everything. That\u2019s how I knew you were running from your demons too.\u201d \nDemons. \nRight.\n***\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Buck says, \u201cyou make a pretty good pillow.\u201d\nUnderneath him, Eddie grunts, tries to shift their position. The space is too tight for two grown men in LAFD uniforms to move. \u201cGlad I could help.\u201d \n\u201cBuck, Diaz, you okay?\u201d \n\u201cYeah, Cap,\u201d Buck shouts up the hole they landed themselves in, \u201cthough I think we may be stuck.\u201d \n\u201cYou got enough oxygen?\u201d \n\u201cYeah, Cap. It\u2019s a snug fit, but we\u2019re fine until rescue.\u201d \n\u201cStay put,\u201d Bobby orders, \u201cyour area looks stable. We\u2019ll send someone in as soon as we have everyone out.\u201d\n\u201cCopy that, Cap.\u201d He looks down at Eddie. \u201cAre you okay? Did you injure anything? Hit your head?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Eddie says. It wasn\u2019t a big fall. \u201cYou?\u201d \n\u201cYou covered my fall.\u201d Buck grins. \u201cMy hero.\u201d\nEddie grunts again. \u201cI\u2019m very happy for you. Meanwhile, I have a piece of rock digging into my head.\u201d \n\u201cOh, here,\u201d he says, and flails around, trying to free his arms. \nEddie\u2019s hands shoot up to hold on to his waist. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHang on\u2014\u201d he gets one arm loose, and brings it up, slipping his hand under Eddie\u2019s head, where--ouch--there is a very sharp edge of a rock. \u201cThere. Is that better?\u201d \nEddie doesn\u2019t say anything, and Buck glances down, worried. His breath catches at the way Eddie is looking at him. It hits him suddenly, that he\u2019s pinned close to Eddie\u2014to Eddie\u2014and that \u2014and that their lips are barely inches apart. \n\nDon\u2019t stare.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Eddie says, voice barely above a whisper. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d \n***\nIt\u2019s not the same. You\u2019re not pinned anywhere. You just don\u2019t have a lot of space to move. Rescue is coming. Eddie is with you. Focus on Eddie. \nDon\u2019t think about his lips. \n***\n\u201cThis is awkward, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d Eddie asks dryly. \n\u201cSeriously, should we try to, like, talk or something? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s awkward that we\u2019ve just been lying here in silence for 20 minutes?\u201d \n\u201cI think it\u2019s awkward that we\u2019ve been lying here for 20 minutes. I don\u2019t know that us talking is going to turn the ship around on that.\u201d \nThere\u2019s a long stretch of silence and Buck shifts a little, making Eddie hiss and say in a huff, \u201cseriously, Buck, it\u2019s bad enough without you moving around so much.\u201d \nBuck stops. \u201cSorry.\u201d \n\u201cI know it\u2019s uncomfortable, I know you like to talk a mile a minute a minute, I know you\u2019re worse than a hyperactive child, but just put yourself on pause for ten goddamn minutes until we\u2019re out of here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Buck says again, stung, \u201cit was just my leg, that\u2019s all.\u201d \nThere\u2019s a pause, and then: \u201cShit.\u201d \nAnd then: \u201cI--I forgot about your leg.\u201d \nWell, lucky you. \n\u201cYou can move, if you want.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cNo, really, it\u2019s okay--\u201d\n\u201cI said I\u2019m fine,\u201d he snaps.\n\n***\nYou\u2019re fine. You\u2019re not pinned. You\u2019re fine. You\u2019re fine.\n***\n\u201cBuck\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk,\u201d Buck says, looking everywhere but Eddie. It\u2019s hard to do, given that Eddie makes up 90% of his field of vision, but he\u2019s managing. \n\u201cBuck, come on, don\u2019t be a baby. Just, let me--\u201d Eddie shifts under him, wrapping his arms tighter around Buck, and lifting one knee up. Buck\u2019s legs slide between Eddie\u2019s, and Buck gives a sigh of relief when his leg is no longer stuck at such an awkward angle. \n\u201cThanks.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Eddie says softly, \u201cyou should have said something sooner.\u201d \nBuck stays quiet, staring at the same lump of rock. The hands around him give a small squeez. \n\u201cChris aced his math test.\u201d\nBuck considers staying stubbornly silent, but it\u2019s an olive branch, and he\u2019s never been good at denying Eddie anything. \nHe drags his eyes back to Eddie. \u201cYeah?\u201d \n\u201cYeah.\u201d Eddie smiles back, looking a little relieved. \u201cHe was worried.\u201d \n\u201cHe had no reason to be. I knew he would ace it. He\u2019s a very smart kid.\u201d \n\u201cI know,\u201d Eddie says, \u201cand you taught him that thing for the multiplication.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah, I had to look it up,\u201d Buck admits, \u201cbut it\u2019s been coming in pretty handy. Apparently that\u2019s how kids are taught in Japan.\u201d \n\u201cWell, Chris sure appreciated it.\u201d \nThe conversation flows after that. They talk about Chris and sports and the latest gossip at work, until eventually, they hear Chim\u2019s voice above them. \n\u201cAlright, break it up, lovebirds.\u201d \n***\nYou\u2019re fine.\n***\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Eddie sighs, sitting still as the paramedics look him over. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get home and hug my kid.\u201d \n\u201cLucky,\u201d Buck teases, \u201cwe should all have a Chris to go home to.\u201d \n\u201cYou can come over if you want.\u201d \nI do, Buck thinks. I do want. I want so badly.\nMaybe he could--no. No, Eddie has his own problems. \n\u201cNah, I\u2019m going to need my own bed tonight.\u201d \n\u201cFirefighter Buckley, have you been looked over?\u201d \nBuck smiles at the paramedic. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Eddie cushioned my fall.\u201d \nEddie scoffs. \n\u201cWhat about your hand?\u201d \nBuck blinks and raises his hand to his eyes. \u201cOh.\u201d \n\u201cIs that from--?\u201d \nHe looks over at Eddie, who is frowning at him.\nBuck rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine. Someone was using it as a pillow for a good two hours.\u201d \n\u201cAre you sure nothing is broken?\u201d the paramedic asks, taking his hand to inspect it, pressing down on the knuckles. \n\u201cYeah, the bruising is just from the blood thinners.\u201d \n\u201cCan you wrap it for him?\u201d \n\u201cEddie, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Buck says with a sigh. \n\u201cNo, he\u2019s right,\u201d the paramedic says, \u201chere, sit down. I\u2019ll wrap it for you. You can take it off in two days.\u201d \nBuck sighs again, but lets her guide him to the seat next to Eddie. \nThey\u2019re quiet for a while, and Buck pretends he doesn\u2019t notice how intensely Eddie is staring as the paramedic wraps his hand.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to keep your hand there,\u201d Eddie finally says. \nBuck looks up to shoot Eddie a quick grin. \u201cBetter my hand than that pretty head of yours.\u201d \n\u201cOh, you think my head is pretty, do you?\u201d \n\u201cYou know I do,\u201d Buck says, fluttering his eyelashes. \nEddie chuckles and turns back to the paramedic who is instructing him to take it easy for a few days--\u201dthere\u2019s nothing broken and no internal bleeding, but you\u2019re going to have some bruising.\u201d\nWhen Buck turns back to his own paramedic, her eyes are flitting between the two of them, a small smile on her lips. Buck shifts uncomfortably. \u201cAm I all done?\u201d \n\u201cYup!\u201d she says a little too loudly, \u201call done.\u201d \nShe packs up her gear and shoots him a parting wink before leaving. \nBuck blushes and rolls to his feet. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m, uh, I\u2019m gonna head out. Call me if you or Chris need anything, okay?\u201d \n\u201cThanks,\u201d Eddie says. \nHe\u2019s almost out when Eddie calls him and he turns around. \u201cAre we okay?\u201d \n\u201cYeah, man,\u201d Buck says easily. \u201cOf course we are.\u201d\nMaybe he\u2019s wrong and tonight won\u2019t be a bad night. \n***\n\u201cCome on, kid, breathe.\u201d\nBuck tries, but he can\u2019t get his lungs to work properly. He lets Cole push him down towards a bench, tucks his head between his knees. \nA strong hand comes up behind him, rubbing his back. \u201cJesus, what were they thinking leaving you alone like this?\u201d \nBuck shakes his head, gulping in air. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t tell them.\u201d \n\u201cAnd they didn\u2019t ask.\u201d\nHe shakes his head again. \u201cThey don\u2019t think they have to ask. They think if I have a problem, I\u2019d tell them.\u201d \n\u201cSo why don\u2019t you tell them?\u201d Cole asks once Buck is no longer in the middle of a panic attack. \nBuck takes a breath--breathing, what a concept, right?--and keeps his eyes on where the sun is just peaking out over the horizon. \n\u201cThey--\u201d he scrubs his hand through his hair, \u201c--they have their own problems. I can\u2019t just keep bringing up something that happened so long ago. Besides, Eddie took the brunt of the fall. I barely got a scratch on me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he walked away with bruises, I\u2019m sure. And you walked away with--\u201d \nHe cuts himself off, pursing his lips. \nHe doesn\u2019t need to finish. \nThey both know what he walked away with.\n***\n\u201cSo, explain to me, again, how you found a bag full of money while out on a run, and you turned it right over to the police without taking any of it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d Buck says, looking at Bobby for support. The other man nods. \n\u201cLike, all of it, you didn\u2019t even take like, a bill to pay for your breakfast?\u201d \nBuck looks between everyone standing over him. \u201cNo?\u201d \n\u201cYou weren\u2019t even tempted?\u201d \nHe just blinks at them. What is he not getting? \n\u201cBut...it wasn\u2019t my money.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cThat would be stealing.\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d Chim says, \u201cbut if you spent it, it would be like shopping.\u201d \nBuck frowns at him. The older man looks back, disgusted. \u201cGod, did you and Maddie, like, not own a television when you were growing up?\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, Chim,\u201d he tells him. \nThey don\u2019t let the topic drop. It\u2019s all he hears about all day, how he could have been filthy rich if he\u2019d just grabbed the money and ran. \nThree days later, he drops an even bigger bomb on them.\n\u201cYou did what?\u201d \nThis time, even Bobby is looking at him like he\u2019s crazy. \n\u201cWait, wait--\u201d \n\u201c--no one claimed the money--\u201d \n\u201c--and you said you didn\u2019t want it?\u201d \nBuck shrugs, digging into his carton of noodles. \u201cI told them they can donate it. It didn\u2019t feel right.\u201d \n\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you tell them to donate it to my bank account instead?\u201d Hen asks. \n\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, shooting her an apologetic look, \u201cdidn\u2019t think of that.\u201d \n\u201cSettle down everyone, Buck did a good thing.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Bobby.\u201d \n\u201cI just can\u2019t with him right now,\u201d Chim says, standing up. \u201cI lost my appetite.\u201d \n\u201cMe too.\u201d Hen says, throwing down her chopsticks in disgust and following Chim. \nBuck watches them go. \u201cSo I shouldn\u2019t tell them about the five million dollars settlement money I turned down?\u201d \nBobby chuckles. \u201cLet\u2019s save that for when we\u2019re trying to give Chim a heart attack.\u201d \nBobby stands up and puts his food away, patting Buck on the back as he passes. \u201cYou did good. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d \nBuck beams at the praise, digging into his food with gusto. It takes him a minute to realize that Eddie is flicking looks at him out of the corner of his eyes. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d \nEddie shakes his head. \u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d \nA pause. \n\u201cSo, five million dollars?\u201d \n\u201cYeah.\u201d Uncomfortable, Buck shifts his body just slightly away. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you forgot about my lawsuit.\u201d \n\u201cNo, I just didn\u2019t know--\u201d Eddie licks his lips. \u201cYou turned down five million dollars?\u201d \nBuck tries to shrug again. It\u2019s harder this time. The noodles slip through his chopsticks. \u201cYeah, I wasn\u2019t doing it for the money, Eddie. I just wanted to be back here.\u201d \nHe looks up when Eddie doesn\u2019t say anything for a long time. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d \n\u201cNothing,\u201d he says again, with a soft shake of his head, and turns back to his own food. \u201cSo where did you ask them to donate the money?\u201d \n\u201cThe Cerebral Palsy Foundation.\u201d Buck tells him, reaching for a dumpling. \nEddie\u2019s head snaps towards him, and the look he gives him makes Buck squirm. \u201cReally?\u201d \n\u201cDamn,\u201d Hen says, coming back up the stairs, and picking up her carton of food. \u201cThat\u2019s actually really sweet. I can\u2019t even be mad about that.\u201d \nBuck turns away from Eddie\u2019s probing eyes. \u201cI see your appetite is back.\u201d \nHen rolls her eyes. \u201cYeah, yeah. Gimme those spring rolls.\u201d \nBuck does so, pretending he doesn\u2019t notice that Eddie is still looking at him. \n\u201cThat\u2019s--that\u2019s really nice of you, Buck,\u201d Eddie says, sincerely.\nBuck shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d \nEddie grabs his arm, making him look up. \n\u201cIt is.\u201d Eddie says, holding his gaze. \u201cIt really is.\u201d \nBuck swallows and licks his lips, unable to look away.\nDistantly, he hears Hen\u2019s chair scrape back slowly. \u201cOkaaaay.\u201d \n\u201cAnything for Chris, you know that.\u201d \nEddie smiles. \u201cYeah.\u201d\nThey turn back to their food. Buck can\u2019t be sure, but he thinks Eddie may be blushing as much as he is. \n***\n\u201cDo I have something on my lips?\u201d Buck asks, reaching up to wipe at his mouth. \nEddie frowns. \u201cNo, why?\u201d \n\u201cNothing, you just keep looking at \u2018em.\u201d \nBy the fridge, Hen gives a big bark of laughter. Both their eyes snap towards her before Buck, blushing, turns back to Eddie. \u201cSorry, that sounded weird. Nevermind. Ignore me.\u201d \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Eddie says, standing up to throw his leftovers out. \u201cSee you downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d \nBuck resists the urge to hit his head against the table. \n\u2018You keep looking at my lips.\u2019 What an idiot. \n***\nOne of the benefits of SEAL training--and there are not many as far as Buck is concerned (although drown proofing certainly came in useful during the tsunami)--is that you process fear differently. You react to stress differently. \nBuck is impulsive, yes. He\u2019s reckless, yes. And generally a little slow on the uptake, he knows. But one thing he\u2019s not is a coward. He can keep a clear head in an emergency. Make the decisions that need to be made. \nUsually. \nIt\u2019s when someone he loves gets in trouble that he loses his head. The SEALs had tried to train that out of him too. \nSometimes, he wishes he\u2019d let them. \n\u201cYou want to tell me what the hell you were thinking rushing in there like that?\u201d\nBuck stares down at his hands. He\u2019d tried to wash all the grime off, but it's still caking under his fingernails. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bobby.\u201d \n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not good enough, Buck. I gave you a direct order and you not only disobeyed me, you deliberately put yourself in danger.\u201d \n\u201cI know,\u201d Buck says, \u201cI do, I just\u2014I saw Eddie trapped in there, and I don\u2019t know what happened, I couldn\u2019t think, Bobby, I\u2019m sorry. I had to get him out.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what if something had happened to you?\u201d \n\u201cIt--it wouldn\u2019t have mattered, Bobby.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d \nHe looks up, takes in Bobby\u2019s enraged expression, and swallows. \u201cIt\u2019s Eddie.\u201d \n\u201cWhat the fuck is that supposed to mean?\u201d \nBuck turns quickly on his heels, and immediately takes a step back at the look on his friends face. \u201cEddie--\u201d\nEddie starts advancing on him. \u201cWhat the fuck--\u201d\nBuck is raising his hands to start placating when Bobby steps in between them. \u201cEddie, cool it.\u201d \n\u201cCap--\u201d \n\u201cWalk it off, Firefighter Diaz,\u201d Bobby says, \u201cnow.\u201d \nEddie glares at Bobby, chest heaving, and Buck thinks he should intervene, let Eddie take a swing at him if it means he doesn\u2019t take a swing at Bobby. \nFinally, Eddie takes a step back and Buck releases a breath. \n\u201cGo get yourself sorted out, and we\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d \nWith a final glare at Buck, Eddie turns on his heels and stomps out of the station, pausing only to pick up his bag. \nBuck watches him go and when he looks back at Bobby again, the other man is watching him like he knows something Buck doesn\u2019t even know himself. \n\u201cCome on,\u201d he says gently, \u201clet\u2019s talk in my office.\u201d \n***\n\u201cBobby,\u201d Buck starts as soon as they enter his office. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, I know I messed up. I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that in a minute,\u201d Bobby says, leaning against his desk. \u201cFirst, are you going to tell me what\u2019s been going on with you?\u201d \nBuck feels his throat close up. \u201cI--I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d \nBobby gives him a look. \u201cBuck, I don\u2019t need to be a shrink to know that something\u2019s been wrong for a while now. I know you\u2019ve been through a lot, so I\u2019ve been trying to give you your space, but I need to know that you\u2019re okay.\u201d \n\u201cI--I am,\u201d Buck stutters, \u201creally, Bobby--\u201d \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about it right now if you\u2019re not ready, Buck,\u201d Bobby tells him, \u201cbut I want you to know that you can always come to me.\u201d \n\u201cI know that.\u201d \n\u201cDo you?\u201d Buck nods. \u201cGood. Because you\u2019re one of the most important people to me too, Buck. And if there\u2019s something hurting you, I want to know. And I want to help.\u201d \n\u201cThanks, Bobby,\u201d Buck says, blinking back tears. \n\u201cAnd at some point,\u201d Bobby says gently, \u201cnot now, but when you\u2019re ready, we\u2019re going to have to discuss Eddie.\u201d\nBuck sucks in a breath.\n\u201cBobby--\u201d \nThe other man shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Buck. When you\u2019re ready.\u201d \nBuck nods again, swallowing the lump in his throat. \n\u201cNow.\u201d Bobby straightens and walks around to the other side of his desk. \u201cAbout your little stunt\u2026\u201d \n***\nA half-hour reprimand, and instructions to rest for the next few days, and Buck is allowed to leave. His body is aching all over, but his leg is especially painful to the point that he can\u2019t take a step without limping and he really wishes he\u2019d brought his car into work today. Or thought to charge his phone. \nIt\u2019s gonna be a long walk. \nHe stops when he steps outside and sees Eddie leaning against his truck, arms crossed and glaring at the pavement. \n\u201cEddie? What are you still doing here?\u201d \n\u201cI didn\u2019t see your car,\u201d Eddie says, not looking up, \u201cthought you might need a ride.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, I, uh, ran to work.\u201d \nHe looks up at that, eyebrows raised. It\u2019s not exactly a short distance to run. He opens his mouth, but Buck cuts in before he can ask anything, \u201cI\u2019d love a ride, thanks.\u201d \nHe takes a step, the pain in his leg making it awkward, and he winces. \nEddie huffs and comes forward, taking his bag in one hand, and his arm in the other, guiding him to the car, muttering in Spanish the whole way. \n\u201cYou know, I can sort of understand you, right?\u201d Buck says as Eddie swats his hands away to very aggressively fix his seatbelt for him. Buck lets him, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s injured his hands. \nEddie shoots him a dirty look and switches, presumably, to Swedish. \nBuck shifts uncomfortably in his seat and tells himself that whatever is happening in his gut right now is just another symptom of his current injuries. \n\u201cHey,\u201d Buck says at one point when he notices that they are one hundred percent not going to his home. \u201cThat\u2019s not--\u201d \n\u201cShut up.\u201d \nBuck, wisely, does. \nHe stays quiet even when Eddie manhandles him into his house and places him on his couch. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Buck?\u201d Chris asks, hovering as Eddie aggressively plies Buck with blankets and quilts and pillows. \n\u201cEverything,\u201d Eddie says, tucking Buck\u2019s blankets so tightly around him, he can\u2019t move his arms. \n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Buck assures Chris, smiling at him softly, then yelping when he gets a pillow in his face, and another blanket piled on top of him. \u201cI don\u2019t have a cold, Eddie.\u201d \nThe other man glares and Buck immediately backs away, as much as his blanket/pillow prison allows him. \u201cI mean--\u201d \nEddie points at him and spits something that Buck doesn\u2019t even want to know what it means, but it makes Chris giggle. Buck looks over at the boy. \n\u201cDaddy called you a bad word.\u201d \nBuck smiles. \u201cYeah, I got that, buddy.\u201d\nEddie, seemingly done with whatever the hell he was doing to Buck, stomps off into the kitchen. Buck watches as Chris\u2019s face falls as he watches his dad, teeth worrying at his bottom lip. Poor kid\u2019s probably not used to seeing Eddie like this. Hell, Buck\u2019s barely seen Eddie like this.\n\u201cHey, Superman, you want to play a game?\u201d \nChris beams. \u201cYea--\u201d \n\u201cNo.\u201d \n\u201cAw, but, dad, I\u2019ve done all my homework. You can check.\u201d \nEddie takes a breath and forces a smile for his son. \u201cNo, honey, you can play whatever you want. Buck is not allowed.\u201d \n\u201cMy hands work fine, Eddie. I can hold a controller.\u201d \nThe smile slips off Eddie\u2019s face and he glares at Buck. \u201cYou\u2019re going to sit there and think about what you did today.\u201d \n\u201cWhat are you, grounding me?\u201d \nEddie crosses his arms and raises an eyebrow. \nBuck sputters. \u201cYou can\u2019t ground me, Eddie. I\u2019m an adult. You have no jurisdiction over me.\u201d \nThere\u2019s a moment of silence and Buck thinks he may have won this round. \n\u201cAdult remains to be seen.\u201d \nBuck lets his head fall back with a groan. \n***\nEddie cooks them chicken noodle soup for dinner. Buck hates chicken noodle soup, and he would like to point out again, for the record, that he doesn\u2019t have a cold but he takes the soup and accepts seconds and says nothing of that to Eddie. Thankfully, at least, it\u2019s one of the few dishes Eddie can produce that is actually edible. \nEddie, for his part, makes a concession to the terms of Buck\u2019s confinement, and he\u2019s permitted to watch television cuddled up with Chris. Buck makes it through two episodes of Chris\u2019s show before his eyes start slipping and he drifts off to sleep.\nMaybe tonight\u2014\n***\n\u201cDad?\u201d \n\u201cYeah, bud?\u201d\n\u201cWhy is Buck sad?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s just tried, buddy. And he got hurt today, remember?\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t mean right now. I mean the rest of the time.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Chris?\u201d \n \u201cHe just always looks sad. Why is he sad?\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Chris. He looks fine to me.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, because you\u2019re looking. He\u2019s happy when you\u2019re looking. He\u2019s sad when no one\u2019s looking.\u201d \nThere\u2019s a long bit of silence and Buck hears, \u201ccome on, let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d \nThe voices drift off. \n***\nIt\u2019s cold and Buck\u2019s shivering. \nHe throws his hand around for his blanket, but there\u2019s no purchase and his eyelids are too heavy for him to sit up and look for it. He whines and throws his hand around one more time. Nothing.\nThere\u2019s a chuckle from somewhere in the room. Buck can\u2019t remember if there is supposed to be someone else with him right now but the sound is warm and the voice is safe so he\u2019s not worried. \n\u201cHow did you manage that?\u201d \nA minute later, he\u2019s covered with a blanket and he smiles, snuggling into its warmth. \nA hand runs through his hair. He knows that touch. Just can\u2019t remember who it belongs to right now. He turns into it. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you, Buck?\u201d \n***\nBuck doesn\u2019t know what he did wrong. One minute they\u2019re all laughing and joking, helping some models who\u2019d gotten their hair stuck in a strange-looking torture contraption, the next Eddie is glaring at him. \n\u201cEddie?\u201d \nThe other man shakes his head, like he\u2019s disappointed but not surprised, like of course, Buck did what he did. Like it\u2019s typical Buck.\nBuck steps away from the model who\u2019d been asking him about his workout routine to stare at Eddie\u2019s retreating back. \nHe swings his eyes to the rest of his team, who\u2019ve abandoned their own work in favour of watching the two of them.\n\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d Chim says, turning away. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything.\u201d \nHe looks to Hen who shrugs and returns to tending to her own model. \nHe turns to the model, Trudy, because she was there, maybe she knows what happened, but she just blinks back at him guilelessly. \nEddie is white-knuckled and silent on the ride back to the station, staring straight ahead and ignoring the worried glances Buck keeps throwing at him. \nHe\u2019s tense and subdued at lunch, glaring at the table and ignoring any of Buck\u2019s attempts at conversation. He doesn\u2019t even blink at being assigned dish duty. \nBuck jumps to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Eddie says, brushing past him. \nBuck\u2019s not sure, but he might burst into tears soon. \n\u201cI need your help downstairs,\u201d Bobby says, placing a hand on Buck\u2019s shoulder. \nBuck looks at his hand for a minute then nods and follows him downstairs. \nHe pretends he doesn\u2019t hear the voices upstairs, arguing back and forth, but each time he hears his name he shrinks further into himself. \nHe may have just lost Eddie and he doesn\u2019t even know what he did. \nAs soon as Chim and Hen make their way downstairs, Buck is pushing past them, ignoring the other two calling his name. \nHe has to try. \nEddie\u2019s hands are braced against the sink, head down and looking utterly dejected when Buck gets to the kitchen. He doesn\u2019t look up when Buck walks up to him, but his shoulders visibly tense. \n\u201cIf you tell me what I did wrong,\u201d Buck says quietly, \u201cI\u2019ll fix it, I promise.\u201d\nEddie just shakes his head. \nBuck holds perfectly still. \nFinally, Eddie releases a breath and straightens up, turning to look directly at Buck. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong, Buck.\u201d \nBuck just looks back at him. \u201cEddie, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d \nEddie reaches up, hesitating for a second, before putting his hand on Buck\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI promise, you didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d \n\u201cYeah?\u201d he asks a little breathlessly, hope surging. \n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s my fault. Nothing about today that was your fault. One hundred percent, it was all me. And I\u2019m really, really sorry.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Buck rushes to say, \u201creally, it is. As long as we\u2019re okay.\u201d \nEddie\u2019s thumb moves to stroke absently at Buck\u2019s neck. \u201cWe\u2019re okay.\u201d \nBuck lets out a relieved laugh and Eddie gives him one of his Eddie smiles and then they\u2019re pulling each other into a bear-hug. \nEddie\u2019s arms feel as steady and sure as they always have. Buck breathes him in. \n***\n\u201cSo, like, I have to check. Are you aware that you\u2019re in love with Eddie?\u201d \nBuck chokes on his beer and looks at his sister. \u201cMaddie.\u201d \n\u201cBecause I know that you\u2019re in love with Eddie. I just want to make sure you\u2019re aware of it.\u201d \nFirst, Buck says: \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Of course not.\u201d\nThen, Buck says: \u201cYou\u2019re just seeing things, because you\u2019re so determined for me to be in a relationship.\u201d \nThen, he says: \u201cIf you don\u2019t drop it, I will tell Chim about that time in high school, with Paul Butcher.\u201d\nFinally, Buck says: \n\u201cMaddie, I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t be in love with him. I\u2019ll lose him. He\u2019s my very straight best friend, and if I love him, I\u2019ll lose him.\u201d \nI can\u2019t lose him, he says. I can\u2019t lose Chris. \nWhen she pulls him into a hug, he buries his head in her shoulder like he used to do when he was a kid, and they both pretend he\u2019s not crying. \n***\n\u201cHey.\u201d Buck blinks when he swings open the door and sees Eddie standing there, shifting nervously in one spot. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d \nEddie thrusts up the bag he\u2019s holding and Buck has to move back quickly to avoid getting hit in the face with it. \n\u201cI brought Italian.\u201d \nBuck steps back to let him in. \u201cOkay? Why?\u201d \n\u201cUh, well, Chris is at a sleepover and I haven\u2019t seen you in a while, so I thought I\u2019d bring a home cooked meal and we\u2019d hang out.\u201d \nBuck doesn\u2019t know what to make of that or the way Eddie is looking at him as he says it. \u201cUh...great. Great. Well, thanks.\u201d He pauses. \u201cSo, uh, you cooked?\u201d \nEddie shoots him a look. \u201cNo, you can breathe easy. Carla cooked.\u201d \n\u201cOh, thank God.\u201d \u2018Cause he\u2019d have eaten it, and smiled, and said it was delicious, but he\u2019s really glad he doesn\u2019t have to. Though it does beg the question, \u201cwhy did Carla cook for us? We could have just ordered a pizza.\u201d \n\u201cShe, uh, wanted it to be special.\u201d \nBuck shoots him a questioning look, but Eddie can\u2019t see because he has his head buried in the fridge. \n\u201cThe beer\u2019s, like, right there,\u201d Buck says.\n\u201cGot it.\u201d He resurfaces with two beers, and slides one towards him, leaning back against the counter in a way that looks distinctly not-casual. \nBuck\u2019s frown deepens. \u201cYou okay? You look red.\u201d \nEddie gives him a tight smile. \u201cFine.\u201d\n\u201cO-kay.\u201d This was officially the strangest thing that had happened in a while. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down here, and I\u2019ll warm up the food.\u201d \n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do\u2014\u201c\n\u201cEddie, no offence, I don\u2019t trust you with reheating Carla\u2019s food.\u201d \nEddie chuckles and holds up his hands in surrender. \n\u201cOh, nice, chicken parm.\u201d He looks up from the baggie. \u201cI love chicken parm.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d \nThey talk as Buck takes care of the food and Eddie sets the table. Eddie has a nervous energy around him, like he\u2019s vibrating in his own skin, and it\u2019s making Buck nervous too. But Eddie is right, they haven\u2019t seen each other in a while (Buck\u2019s fault, again) and Buck hasn\u2019t realized how on edge that had made him. Seeing him, even when he\u2019s acting strange, is like a balm to frayed nerves.\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s been going on?\u201d Eddie asks as they sit down for their dinner. \u201cWhat\u2019s been keeping you busy?\u201d \n\u201cUh, you know, um,\u201d Buck fakes a cough, \u201cjust, uh, some doctors appointments, some errands.\u201d\nSome moping, because he\u2019s trying to figure out how to co-exist with his best friend, now that his sister has made him admit his feelings out loud. \n\u201cWhy were you at the doctors?\u201d Eddie frowns. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d \n\u201cYeah, yeah, just routine checkups. Doctors think\u2014\u201c the oven dings \u201c\u2014hang on, that\u2019s the dessert. I should take it out.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe Carla made us cake, too.\u201d Buck says, pulling on his oven mitts. \u201cShe went all out.\u201d \n\u201cYes, she\u2014\u201c There\u2019s a knock at the door. \u201c\u2014I\u2019ll get it.\u201d \n\u201cThanks,\u201d Buck says, taking the cake out and frowning at it. He\u2019s never made chocolate lava cake before, but Carla\u2019s instructions had just been to warm it...it looked warm enough\u2014\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m looking for Evan Buckley?\u201d \n\u201cUh, yeah, sure\u2014\u201c\nBuck sticks his head back. \u201cCole?\u201d\nThe older man\u2019s shoulders sag with relief. \u201cHi, kid.\u201d \nHe puts the cake down and makes a beeline towards him. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Everything okay? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d \nCole rolls his eyes but pulls him into a hug. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I was worried about you.\u201d \nBuck, because he has never in his life, turned down a hug, hugs him back just as tight, even though he has no idea what the fuck is going on. \nWhy was everyone acting strange? Did someone put something in the water?\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. Why, do you know something I don\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t darkened my running route in over a week.\u201d Cole says, pulling back. \u201cI got worried. I thought you might have\u2026\u201d\nRealization dawns on him. \u201cOh. But I texted you.\u201d \n\u201cForgive an old man for being paranoid. You\u2019re not exactly known to be forthcoming when something\u2019s wrong.\u201d \n\u201cSorry.\u201d Both men\u2019s eyes fly to Eddie. \u201cWho are you?\u201d \n\u201cCole Terrence,\u201d the older man says, shaking Eddie\u2019s hand, at the same time that he claps Buck\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBuck and I are midnight running buddies.\u201d \nEddie\u2019s eyebrows shoot up and then he\u2019s frowning. \u201cBuck?\u201d \nBuck gives a nervous chuckle and turns to Cole instead. \u201cUh, you want to join us for dinner, Cole?\u201d \nIt\u2019s Cole\u2019s turn to raise his eyebrows as he looks over Buck\u2019s shoulder at the set dinner table. \u201cYou must be Eddie.\u201d He doesn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cWell, I apologize for interrupting your dinner. Good to see I worried for nothing. Eddie, it was nice to meet you. Buck, I\u2019ll speak with you later.\u201d \n\u201cLater, Cole.\u201d Buck says, watching Eddie cautiously as the other man examines him. When the door shuts, they barely even notice. \nThe silence that follows is stifling. \n\u201cSo.\u201d He claps his hands. \u201cShall we eat?\u201d \n\u201cBuck.\u201d \n\u201cThe pasta was delicious.\u201d \n\u201cBuck.\u201d \nHe sits down and takes a giant bite of the food. \u201cSeriously, she\u2019s outdone herself.\u201d\n\u201cBuck.\u201d Eddie snaps. \u201cAre you seriously going to pretend that didn\u2019t just happen?\u201d \n\u201cIt was just Cole. It\u2019s fine.\u201d \n\u201cStop lying to me!\u201d Buck jumps a little. \u201cWhy does a man, who I didn\u2019t even know existed, show up, out of nowhere, worrying if you\u2019ve hurt yourself? Why are you part of the super exclusive After Midnight Running Club? Why does Chris worry that you\u2019re sad all the time?\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d Buck cuts in, \u201cChris is worried about me?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Chris, is worried about you. He keeps asking me why you\u2019re sad. And I don\u2019t know what to tell him, Buck! I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re sad, I don\u2019t know anything!\u201d \n\u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d Way to go Buck. You did it again. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Eddie. I didn\u2019t mean to worry him.\u201d \nFor a minute Eddie doesn\u2019t say anything, then he drops to the chair. \u201cI\u2019m not upset because you\u2019ve worried Chris, Buck. I\u2019m upset because something is wrong and you won\u2019t talk to me.\u201d \nBuck picks his fork back up, twisting his pasta around it again and again, watching the tines as he does so. \n\u201cBuck, what\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d He takes a breath, releases it slowly. \u201cI haven\u2019t been feeling really well. Lately. In my head. I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d He swallows. \u201cI get a lot of nightmares.\u201d He licks his lips. Does it again for good measure. \u201cI started running so I could cope better. That\u2019s how I met Cole. He\u2019s been trying to convince me to go to therapy, but after last time I tried that, I don\u2019t really\u2026\u201d He looks up at Eddie. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get better. I swear.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2014\u201c He twirls the pasta around his fork one last time then drops it with a clank. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to bother you.\u201d \n\u201cHow could you possibly think that you\u2019d be bothering me?\u201d \nBuck risks a quick glance at Eddie, before dropping his gaze down again. \u201cI know I can be...exhausting. I don\u2019t mean to be, and I don\u2019t mean to make my problems other people\u2019s problems. Sometimes I can\u2019t help it\u2014I know I do dumb stuff\u2014but I\u2019m trying to be better.\u201d \n\u201cWhat fucking asshole told you you were exhausting?\u201d \nBuck hesitates. \nOne of Eddie\u2019s hands reaches over to cover his. \u201cBuck?\u201d \nFor a minute all Buck can do is stare down at where their hands are linked. He\u2019d been right. They do fit well together. \n\u201cBuck? You\u2014\u201c\n\u201cUh, you did,\u201d he says and clears his throat, \u201cyou know, that day in the grocery store.\u201d \nJust like that, Eddie\u2019s hand is snatched back. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, at the grocery store, during the lawsuit. You were yelling, and I asked why you couldn't see my side of things and you\u2014\u201c\nEddie sits back, like Buck has just knocked him out. \u201cI said because that\u2019s all you see. I said you were exhausting and you whine about your life when we all have our own problems.\u201d \n\u201cYeah...I mean, it\u2019s okay, Eddie.\u201d \n\u201cBuck...I was angry.\u201d \nHe nods, takes a sip of his beer. \u201cI know, it\u2019s okay. I get that. But just because you said it when you were angry, doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t think it when you\u2019re not angry. And I\u2014I don\u2019t want to be a burden.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re not a burden, Buck, I promise. I\u2014I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d \n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything,\u201d Buck rushes to say. \u201cI told you\u2014\u201c\nEddie shakes his head, having no indication of having heard him. \u201cI thought the street fighting was the end of the damage I caused with my anger issues. I thought I was starting to make up for everything. Turns out I haven\u2019t even made a dent.\u201d \n\u201cYou were going through a really bad time, Eddie,\u201d Buck reminds him. \u201cAnd you needed me there, and I wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t blame you for being angry.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, yeah, and you apologized for that a thousand times, and I just said, \u2018don\u2019t beat yourself up about it.\u2019\u201d \nEddie purses his lips, keeps his eyes locked on the table. Buck watches him chew on his lips for a minute, then two. \nFinally, just when Buck is about to say something, Eddie gives a humourless laugh and scrubbs his hands across his face. \n\u201cEddie?\u201d \n\u201cI was going to ask you to dinner tonight.\u201d Eddie tells him. \u201cLike, a date dinner. With music and candlelight and I\u2019d get to kiss you at the end of it.\u201d He sniffles. \u201cAnd all this time you were scared of coming to me\u2014you were scared of me.\u201d \nBuck, who\u2019d sat up at the mention of date, stares at him. \u201cWait, what?\u201d \n\u201cHow fucked up is that? You had a truck fall on you, had a pulmonary embolism, and survived a tsunami, and I called you exhausting\u2014\u201d \n\u201c\u2014wait, Eddie, what about the kissing?\u2014\u201c\n\u201c\u2014What do I do with that? How do I\u2014do I tell you I\u2019m sorry? Do I get to do that? Do I still get to call you my friend? It\u2019s okay, if you don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d \n\u201c\u2014No, go back, go back to the kissing, Eddie. What about the kissing?\u201d \nEddie shakes his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d \n\u201c\u2014it matters, I swear it matters\u2014\u201c\n\u201c\u2014it\u2019s too late\u2014\u201c\n\u201c\u2014it\u2019s not too late. Ask. Ask me to dinner. See what happens\u2014\u201c\n\u201c\u2014I blew my shot and I didn\u2019t even know it\u2014\u201c\n\u201c\u2014Oh my God, Edmundo, will you shut up?!\u201d\nEddie startles back, staring at Buck with wide eyes. \u201cBuck?\u201d \nBuck sits back and takes a deep breath. Then takes a few more, just to be sure. \u201cNow. What the fuck was that about a date?\u201d \n\u201cUh.\u201d Eddie\u2019s hand flies to rub the back of his head sheepishly. \u201cSorry?\u201d \n\u201cEddie. I am going to need so many more words.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m in love with you?\u201d \nBuck\u2019s not even sure his brain works anymore. \u201cThose\u2014those are good words.\u201d \nA small smile begins to form. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Keep going.\u201d \n\u201cUh,\u201d he gives a nervous chuckle. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to start. I, I don\u2019t know when I started to fall in love with you. By the time it hit me, I was already there. Which you can understand was a problem, because as far as I was aware, I was very straight. So the fact that all I could think about was kissing you, was more than a little confusing.\u201d \nBuck grins triumphantly. \u201cSo you were looking at my lips.\u201d \n\u201cYes, yes, I was.\u201d Eddie smiles back. \u201cSo anyway. I was driving myself and Chris and Carla and Frank and Hen and Chimney and Bobby crazy because I couldn\u2019t figure out my own head\u2014and then you started avoiding me, which made me drive everyone more crazy. And I thought I have to know if I have a chance. Even if all I got to do tonight was just put my cards on the table and wait for you to make a decision.\u201d \n\u201cWow,\u201d Buck says. \n\u201cYeah.\u201d \n\u201cWow.\u201d \n\u201cYeah.\u201d \n\u201cLike, really, wow\u2014\u201c\n\u201cBuck!\u201d Eddie gives a soft, exasperated laugh. \u201cDid I break you? Do you need to process? Should I go?\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d Buck\u2019s hand shoots out to keep him in place, even though Eddie hadn\u2019t actually made any move to get up. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Eddie says, covering Buck\u2019s hand with his own, thumb running gently over Buck\u2019s knuckles. \u201cDo you think you can give me a few more words this time?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m in love with you too,\u201d Buck says finally, and it feels like a weight has been lifted off of him. \u201cLike, really, stupid in love with you.\u201d \nThe smile he gets from Eddie is blinding. \u201cThose are really good words.\u201d \n\u201cI know,\u201d he says, vision blurring. \u201cBut now you owe me a kiss.\u201d \nEddie gives a wet laugh, and Buck is mollified to see that he\u2019s not the only one embarrassing himself by crying. \u201cWhat about dinner?\u201d \n\u201cFuck dinner,\u201d Buck says, standing up, and pulling on Eddie\u2019s arm.\nEddie laughs and rolls to his feet easily. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Carla that.\u201d \nBuck\u2019s not sure which one of them closes the gap between them, but suddenly Eddie is everywhere and he\u2019s moaning as the other man parts his lips, slipping his tongue into Buck\u2019s mouth. \nBuck\u2019s knees buckle and he stumbles into the kitchen table, Eddie\u2019s strong arms are the only reason he stays upright. \n\u201cBuck,\u201d Eddie says when they pull away for air, \u201cwe should slow down.\u201d \n\u201cGood idea,\u201d he says, pulling Eddie back for another kiss. \n\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Eddie says the next time they pull apart. \n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He crashes their lips together again. \n***\nEddie, being the voice of reason, as always, doesn\u2019t let them go further than some heated kisses that night. \nThey need to talk. About everything. All the fights and the hurt and the scars between them. All the stories they only know one side of. It\u2019ll be hard, it\u2019ll hurt, but they know they have each other now. \nAnd they\u2019ll be okay. \n(Buck, being Buck, convinces Eddie that they can makeout in bed, with a pan of chocolate lava cake between them.)\n***\n\u201cWait, a second\u2014\u201c Buck rolls on top of Eddie who takes his weight with a small grunt. \n\u201cThis is familiar,\u201d he says, pulling Buck closer. \nBuck ignores him and sits up so he\u2019s straddling Eddie. \u201cCarla made us dinner.\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d Eddie says, following Buck up and kissing under his ear, down his jaw. \u201cWe\u2019ve covered this.\u201d \nBuck tilts his head to give him better access. \u201cShe made my favourite and then she made dessert.\u201d \n\u201cShe did,\u201d Eddie says, running his tongue on a particularly sensitive spot then grazing it with his teeth. Buck\u2019s breath hitches and he pushes at Eddie\u2019s chest; this is important and he needs to concentrate. \nEddie leans back on his elbows and waits, a small, soft smile on his face. \n\u201cCarla was totally wingmaning you!\u201d \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Eddie admits sheepishly. \u201cShe said if I brought you my own cooking you\u2019d run for the hills. Although, she didn\u2019t seem too worried about my chances.\u201d \n\u201cWeeell,\u201d Buck says, \u201cif you\u2019d attempted another casserole\u2014\u201c\n\u201c\u2014Hey! You said it was good!\u201d \n\u201cI lied, Eddie,\u201d Buck says, \u201cI was in love, I wasn\u2019t going to insult your cooking when\u2014what\u2014what did I say?\u201d \nAll teasing is suddenly gone from Eddie. \u201cThat long?\u201d \n\u201cUh,\u201d Buck rubs the back of his neck. \u201cYeah?\u201d \n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d \n\u201cBecause...because I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d want to hear it.\u201d \nEddie nods and chews on his lips. \u201cHen said it had to be my move because you take your cues from me.\u201d \n\u201cWell...\u201d Buck lifts his shoulders. \u201cYeah.\u201d \nIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s a secret. \nHe yelps when Eddie moves suddenly, rolling them over to hover over Buck. \nBuck lies still, afraid almost to breathe as he watches Eddie watch him. He feels naked and exposed (not possible, Eddie had been very strict about his no-nudity policy tonight) and like Eddie can see right through his every thought, every insecurity. \nFinally, Eddie leans down and captures Buck\u2019s lips with his own. The kiss is soft and tender, and Buck has never felt so loved or so safe. A tear slides down the side of his face. \n\u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you,\u201d Eddie promises softly when he pulls away, his lips brushing against Buck\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ll make it all up to you.\u201d\n***\n\u201cWell, hallelujah!\u201d Athena chants as she steps into the station, clapping her hands. \nBuck and Eddie spring apart, wiping at their mouths. \n\u201cBobby told me, and I just did not believe him until I saw it with my own eyes.\u201d She looks at them like a proud mother with her idiot sons. \u201cYou two finally got your act together.\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d Hen says, walking up to them, \u201cand they\u2019ve been insufferable ever since.\u201d \n\u201cSeriously,\u201d Chim adds, \u201cI almost lost my breakfast when I walked in on them this morning.\u201d \n\u201cReally?\u201d Bobby asks, joining the group. \u201cI thought I told you two to cool it while on the clock.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re not on the clock now,\u201d Eddie says, \u201cand we weren\u2019t doing anything this morning.\u201d \n\u201cYou were staring into each other\u2019s eyes.\u201d \nBuck grins and reaches for Eddie\u2019s hand. \u201cHave you seen his eyes? Can you blame me?\u201d \n\u201cNo, have you seen your eyes? Your eyes are\u2014\u201c\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d say Athena, Bobby, Chim and Hen, turning on their heels and walking away in four different directions. \nBuck and Eddie watch them go. \n\u201cIt is way too fun to mess with them.\u201d \n***\n\u201cBobby?\u201d \n\u201cYeah?\u201d \n\u201cI think I\u2019m ready to talk now.\u201d \n***\nBuck\u2019s nightmares don\u2019t go away. \nBut they do get better. \nAnd they keep getting better until, eventually, he stops running to escape his own head. Now, most nights, when he goes on a midnight run, it\u2019s out of habit--and to speak to an old friend."
