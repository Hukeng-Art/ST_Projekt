    "text": "There was someone digging through his trash.\nTo be more specific: there was a man in front of Harry\u2019s house. He was holding a camera in one hand while quietly trying to dig through the rubbish bin in front of the house with the other. Harry couldn\u2019t for the life of him remember the man\u2019s name, but recognized him from one of the numerous press conferences he had been forced to attend. And he had been forced to attend quite a few ever since Voldemort\u2019s downfall and the end of the war.\nHarry\u2026 didn\u2019t like it.\nHe didn\u2019t like the press conferences, the attention or the journalists hounding him. He downright hated the articles posted about him going out to buy groceries, the speculations about his relationship status or how much money he had or even the silly articles about people somehow reading his current life situation from the state of his hair \u2013 which was ridiculous! He washed his hair almost every day, why would he need to brush it that often too?\nHarry had wards preventing people from entering his house unless specifically invited, but apparently being a sought-after celebrity wasn\u2019t enough reason to warrant a Fidelius Charm to prevent people from finding him in the first place. According to some it was getting special privileges, or something.\nWhich, well. Thanks, Hermione.\nThe man digging through the trash suddenly froze, and looked up from what he was doing. He glanced towards the front door to confirm that it was still closed, and tried to see if there was anyone watching him from inside. Harry\u2019s windows, charmed to allow people to look out but not in, appeared dark and empty. It was a bit... scary, really.\nSo focused the man was on the seemingly empty windows that he didn\u2019t notice the slight movement behind him. From the darkness there, a tall skeletal figure emerged. The thing, not affected by mortal magic, cast an accusatory look to where it could see Harry standing.\nHarry gave a tight-lipped smile and gestured for the thing to continue its task. It did. Unhappily.\nThe journalist took a step back from the trash, unable to shrug off the feeling of being watched. He could\u2019ve sworn that the night hadn\u2019t been this dark mere moments ago, and Merlin \u2013 how uninteresting was Potter\u2019s trash? There was nothing worth writing about!\nShaking his head in disappointment, the journalist turned, only to come face to face with something he had never seen in his life. Something terrifying. It wasn\u2019t a Dementor, but blessed Circe did it look like one!\n\u201cNo,\u201d the man whimpered, taking a step back and nearly dropping his camera.\n\u201cHey,\u201d the thing said, its voice deep and gravelly. It got no further than that, however, before, in a bout of courage, the journalist gathered his wits, ducked to the side and ran. His camera, by some miracle, was still held tightly in his hands.\nA moment of silence reigned, before the thing turned to where Harry was still standing. It squared its bony shoulders and floated in through the door.\n\u201cYou have to stop making me do this,\u201d it said. \u201cI am Death. This is undignified.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a change of pace for you,\u201d Harry replied. \u201dConsider it a growing experience. A warning for future generations: don\u2019t force the position of Master of Death upon people who do not want it, because you never know what they\u2019ll do with it.\u201d\n\u201dI didn\u2019t force it on you,\u201d Death said. \u201dI never told you to collect the Deathly Hallows. You did that on your own.\u201d\n\u201dI couldn\u2019t not do it, you know,\u201d Harry said, thinking of his last two years at Hogwarts. \u201dEither way, you said I can\u2019t hand over the position to someone else, and so we\u2019re stuck together. Much to our shared delight.\u201d\n\u201dI object,\u201d Death said, gliding across the room to stare at Harry from a much closer distance. \u201dSomething must be done. I have too much work to do to waste time scaring off the pests giving you trouble.\u201d\n\u201dMy problems come in many shapes and forms,\u201d Harry sighed, not particularly happy about this situation either. \u201dNot much I can do about it, really.\u201d\n\u201dWhat if you could?\u201d Death suddenly said, a small blue fire burning bright in its otherwise hollow eyes. \u201dMost of the woes in your life - the people, the hounding, the attention... your childhood, all the battles... every single wound you have... There is one thing they all share in common.\u201d\n\u201dI don\u2019t like how pleased you sound about it,\u201d Harry said. \u201dBut tell me the details anyway.\u201d\n\u201dThe deceased one,\u201d Death continued. \u201dTom Riddle. He is the true source of every trouble you\u2019ve gone through.\u201d\n\u201dI\u2019m not arguing against you, but he is, as you said, deceased,\u201d Harry said, unsure of where this was going, but curious to hear the rest of it. \u201dI made it happen, if you recall.\u201d\n\u201dYour friends are settling down, aren\u2019t they,\u201d Death suddenly said, sounding far too satisfied for Harry to feel comfortable. \u201dSteady jobs, children, routines. You, on the other hand...\u201d\n\u201dI\u2019m aware of my own situation,\u201d Harry muttered, reluctant to acknowledge the flash of hurt he felt about the matter. \u201dHow does that have anything to do with Voldemort and my problems?\u201d\n\u201dThere\u2019s nothing holding you back here,\u201d Death said. \u201dThere\u2019s nothing stopping you from dealing with your problem directly. I need time to do my job, you need something to do in order to leave me alone, Tom Riddle needs to be stopped before he even began\u2014\u201d\n\u201dOh,\u201d Harry said. \u201dOh no.\u201d\nHe bit his lip, considering the situation and his options. How on earth could he leave Ron and Hermione behind like this? Sure, he hadn\u2019t seen them in two weeks \u2013 not after Hermione had shot down his suggestion of additional wards to his home \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t as if they needed him around. He didn\u2019t yet have a job although he had numerous options to choose from. He had friends. He had a life. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was safe and familiar. Leaving it all behind would be an irresponsible thing to do.\n\u201dWhat a horrible suggestion,\u201d Harry muttered. What would be the consequences of him going back, anyway? Would history just rewrite itself? What would he even do there? Besides - when exactly would he be going to? What could he do about Tom Riddle of all people? Harry shook his head, and turned to Death. He stood still for a few moments, before nodding his head slowly. He had often come face to face with mistakes, but none of them were quite as interesting as this.\n\u201dLet\u2019s do it,\u201d Harry said. \u201dI\u2019m in. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n*\n\n\n\n\n1946\n\n\u201dWell now I\u2019ve bloody well seen the worst of it,\u201d Borgin sneered, peering out through one of his shop\u2019s front windows. \u201dLook at that! This is ridiculous!\u201d\nKnockturn Alley was known for being a rather... risky place to be at. Even its business streets with shops and stores of all kinds were often viewed with alarm and suspicion - and not entirely for no reason, either. Dark Arts were discussed in these parts far more frequently than elsewhere, and although Theobet Borgin maintained that his shop simply offered confidential valuation services for unusual and ancient wizarding artefacts, it wasn\u2019t uncommon to engage in some trading alongside the consultation.\nBorgin liked the street his shop was located at. A narrow alleyway with a questionable law office to his left, an abandoned office space across the street and nothing but a gaggle of begging hags roaming the streets and scaring away the people who had no business in Knockturn Alley anyway. That was how everything had been up until now. In fact, for the past year business had been even better, what with young Riddle - a clever snake with remarkable friends - coming to work for him.\nNow, however, something had changed.\n\u201dWhoever that bloody lunatic is, he better pack up and leave fast,\u201d Borgin said. \u201dDisgusting!\u201d\nRight there across the street - where previously there had been a perfectly gloomy abandoned office space - was now a flower shop. And what a flower shop it was! The broken windows were now fixed and sparkling clean, allowing anyone to see the wealth of colours inside. There were flowers and plants of all colours and sizes - most of them were inside the shop, but some were positioned outside in the most obnoxious way imaginable.\nBy the door there were two skeletons wearing orange aprons, one holding a bouquet and wearing a wreath and the other holding up a sloppily written \u201dWelcome!\u201d sign.\n\u201dTom!\u201d Borgin yelled, and the young man in question looked up from the accounts he had been going through. Dressed in a set of robes far too proper for a place such as this, with his hair combed neatly to the side and a pleasant smile on his handsome face, Tom Riddle would have fit right in with the folk working at the ministry. Why he chose to work at Borgin and Burkes, Borgin didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t particularly care, either.\n\u201dYes?\u201d said Riddle, and the older wizard knew better than to mistake the pleasant tone for respectful.\n\u201dDo you see that?\u201d Borgin asked, pointing at the flower shop. \u201dTell me, do you see it?\u201d\n\u201dIt\u2019s hard to miss,\u201d Riddle replied, not quite sure what to think of the appearance of the flower shop across the street.\n\u201dI want you to go there \u2013 yes, right now \u2013 and convince whoever the owner is to move somewhere else,\u201d Borgin said. \u201dI don\u2019t care how you do it. Bribe, threaten - I don\u2019t care. Just get them out and away. This is appalling!\u201d\nTom nodded, though he wasn\u2019t sure if he quite agreed. A flower shop across the street could be anything from a sad attempt at entrepreneurship to a scheme hatched by aurors to snoop around. Either way, it wasn\u2019t the kind of a problem that they needed to worry about. Despite this, however, he was quite eager to step outside the stuffy shop for a moment and breathe a bit of fresh air. If doing so came with the price of convincing some bright-eyed florist to move somewhere else... well, Tom was fine with that.\nCrossing the street, Tom noticed a few hags that usually patrolled the area eyeing the flowers on display with varying degrees of confusion. There was no way the shop owner hadn\u2019t seen them while setting up the display outside. Why would they still go through with this move?\nInside, the flower shop was bright and clean. The place smelled great, the floor was polished and the whole place was far too pleasant to fit into Knockturn Alley. If the owner of this place had planned on fitting in, they had obviously failed.\n\u201dCan I help you?\u201d someone said, and Tom turned to see a man - around his age, if not a little bit younger - wearing what was without a doubt a muggle attire consisting of grey trousers and a dark blue blouse, with an orange apron thrown on top of it all. The man\u2019s eyes were unusually green, and his black hair was in a mess that made Tom\u2019s blood itch with anxiety - couldn\u2019t he have brushed it, at least?\n\u201dI\u2019m looking for the owner,\u201d Tom said, plastering on his face a polite smile. \u201dI\u2019m Tom Riddle. I work across the street.\u201d\n\u201dOh, Merlin,\u201d the man muttered with a heavy sigh. His hands were muddy and he didn\u2019t bother to wipe them before reaching out to shake Tom\u2019s hand. \u201dI\u2019m the owner. Name\u2019s Harry.\u201d\n\u201dI see,\u201d Tom managed to say, casting a cleaning charm on his hand the moment Harry let go of him. Honestly, what kind of a name was Harry, anyway? \u201dPleased to meet you.\u201d\n\u201dHere to buy some flowers?\u201d Harry said, continuing his way to the sink behind the counter, and couldn\u2019t he have washed his hands before reaching out to Tom? \u201dSomething to cheer up a gloomy day in this lovely part of town?\u201d\n\u201dNot exactly, no,\u201d Tom said, his blue eyes narrowing with feigned amusement. \u201dAs I said, I\u2019m from the store across the street, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice a newcomer in the neighbourhood. This is an unusual place for a flower shop, and it made me curious\u2026 so I decided to stop by and welcome you to the area.\u201d\n\u201dOh,\u201d Harry said, smiling cheerfully. \u201dThat\u2019s good. I mean, I thought for a moment that you had come here to feed me some story about this place not being the right one for my business. I\u2019m glad that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\u201dRight,\u201d Tom said, after a heartbeat of silence. \u201dThat... that is not the case at all. It\u2019s good to have you here, Harry.\u201d\nLess than five minutes later Borgin looked at Tom as he returned, and knew immediately that something had gone wrong. \u201dThe, uh, eviction didn\u2019t go as planned, I suspect?\u201d Borgin said carefully. \u201dIt\u2019s all right, I suppose. The shop is bound to close down when no customers appear. In fact, in a matter of a few weeks of no customers I am certain that the owner will be more agreeable to the concept of relocating.\u201d\n\u201dThere\u2019s no need to wait that long,\u201d Tom said, the tone of his voice calm and collected while the look in his eyes spoke of curses twice as cutting as the sharp smile on his face. \u201dDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\n*\nPlaying dumb while lying straight to someone\u2019s face was a form of entertainment Harry had rarely indulged in before. Seeing young Voldemort\u2019s face twitch in barely controlled anger made Harry think of all the other ways he could be a nuisance to the man.\n\u201cYou keep staring across the fucking street,\u201d said a zinnia from a small pot on the counter. \u201cIs there something I should know about, son?\u201d\n\u201cNormal flowers don\u2019t speak,\u201d Harry murmured, still staring through the window at Borgin and Burke\u2019s. \u201cNot that I mind.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not a fucking normal flower, now am I?\u201d the zinnia snapped back. \u201cI\u2019m a reaper!\u201d\n\u201dCan you really call yourself that when you\u2019re not, you know, reaping anything?\u201d Harry asked. \u201dDeath gave you strict instructions to stay here with me. And I recall something about being quiet, too.\u201d\n\u201dIf I had known I\u2019d end up becoming this... weed with a red face and leaves for arms, I\u2019d have declined the fucking honour of receiving a solo mission,\u201d the zinnia said, twisting to look at Harry with a pair of invisible eyes. \u201dYou and I are stuck together from now on, pal, so you\u2019re better off just telling me all about this boy you kept eyeing up earlier.\u201d\n\u201dI wasn\u2019t eyeing him,\u201d Harry said. \u201dHe\u2019s the enemy. We\u2019re here for the sole purpose of making life a little less comfortable for him.\u201d\n\u201dReally,\u201d the zinnia said sceptically. \u201dDeath said that you have unresolved issues that you should be projecting at the rightful target rather than innocent bystanders.\u201d\n\u201dThat man is the rightful target,\u201d Harry assured the flower. \u201dBesides, you needn\u2019t worry about him. He doesn\u2019t deserve it. Not to mention that I doubt he\u2019ll be coming back here anytime soon. I\u2019ll probably have to visit him to establish contact again, and you won\u2019t be bothered by our\u2026 conversation.\u201d\n\u201dI have a strong feeling inside of me,\u201d the zinnia spat angrily. \u201dI feel that you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\u201dI\u2019m not,\u201d Harry said.\nHe was. Of course he was.\nA day later, around lunchtime, Harry was drinking a cup of tea while reading the newspaper - to think that he could read the news about Grindelwald\u2019s defeat like this, fresh off the press, rather than through history books and archived newspapers! - when Tom Riddle stepped back into his shop. Tall, well-dressed and handsome, Riddle was clearly the kind of a man who knew exactly how good he looked.\nHarry sighed.\n\u201dThat\u2019s not the kind of a sigh you were going for,\u201d the zinnia whispered furiously. \u201dYou said he\u2019s the enemy! Remember? Be frustrated! Not smitten!\u201d\n\u201dHarry,\u201d Riddle said, and Merlin, it was very different from the times Voldemort had used his first name. \u201dI came by again - I hope you don\u2019t mind - to discuss your relocation plans.\u201d\n\u201dI have no such plans,\u201d Harry said. \u201dWould you like to buy a flower? Roses are popular these days.\u201d Harry quite honestly didn\u2019t know whether they were popular or not, but it wasn\u2019t as if Riddle would know that either.\n\u201dNo,\u201d Riddle replied. \u201dNo thank y-- is that today\u2019s paper?\u201d\n\u201dYes,\u201d Harry said, skimming through the last few lines of the article. \u201dThey\u2019ve written quite a bit about Grindelwald, and the man who defeated him.\u201d\n\u201dDumbledore,\u201d Riddle said, his voice carefully neutral. \u201dWho knew he\u2019d manage such a feat.\u201d\n\u201dI don\u2019t know the man, but isn\u2019t it great?\u201d Harry said cheerfully, leaning closer to Riddle with a bright smile on his face. \u201dWho wants a Dark Lord running around, anyway? Can\u2019t Grindelwald tell how much of a hassle that would be?\u201d\n\u201dWhy on earth would it be a hassle in his eyes,\u201d Riddle asked. \u201dHe\u2019d rule the entire wizarding world! There are bound to be strong wizards wanting that.\u201d\n\u201dYes, sure,\u201d Harry agreed. \u201dBut it\u2019s not just a matter of being strong, right? Running a government is exhausting. Can you imagine having to keep track of every single governmental aspect and negotiations and decisions.... not to mention that Dark Lords tend to rise to power through very illegal means. They\u2019ll have enemies trying to get in their way at every turn. Outlaws and organizations working to bring him, uh, them down.\u201d\n\u201dI\u2019m sure he was prepared for such things,\u201d Riddle said, sounding wholeheartedly unimpressed with Harry and Harry\u2019s opinions. \u201dNot that it matters now, anymore.\u201d\n\u2018You could just let this conversation go,\u2019 Harry thought, though his thoughts sounded a lot like Hermione. \u2018You can be a bit overwhelming when you bury your dates under your opinions sometimes, Harry. I know you\u2019re passionate\u2026 but maybe build up to it? Wait until the third date at least?\u2019\nIt was sound advice, but this wasn\u2019t a date, and so Harry continued:\n\u201dBut how can he truly be prepared to lead a country - even more than one considering his area of, uh, operation - without having ever been in a position of governmental leadership?\u201d Harry asked. \u201dWhy couldn\u2019t he just become the Minister of Magic of his country - I\u2019m sure they have that position, or at least something like it? If he could rally up supporters to overthrow an existing government, he could have made them vote him into power!\u201d\n\u201dIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d Riddle said, rolling his eyes.\n\u201dAnd becoming a Dark Lord is?\u201d Harry shot back instantly. \u201dBeing a ruler and leading wars and changing laws may sound appealing to some, but could Grindelwald actually sit down and discuss issues such as education and employment and taxes and who knows what else? Could you?\u201d\n\u201dYou don\u2019t\u2026 understand - sometimes the entire system needs an overhaul, and doing it by getting elected and having to appease politicians who actively work against you is a serious hindrance.\u201d\n\u201dThen at least try being the minister for a year or two to get a proper idea of what ruling is like! What if you hate it? Are you interested in discussing funding for agriculture or the breeding restrictions for kneazels threatening to overpopulate Wales?\u201d\n\u201dYou know what, yes, I would be interested,\u201d Tom replied, and he wasn\u2019t even lying. \u201dBesides, it\u2019s not as if the minister of magic would be running the government alone. He\u2019ll delegate tasks to competent people. That\u2019s how it is.\u201d\n\u201dIdeally, sure,\u201d Harry said, rolling his eyes. \u201dBut who actually does that? The previous minister - Fawley - was quite the disaster in the office. Now that\u2019s a man who shouldn\u2019t have been anywhere near that position to begin with. Imagine if he had decided to become a Dark Lord instead?\u201d\n\u201dThat\u2019s not a sound comparison at all,\u201d Tom said dismissively. \u201dFawley was forced out of office and suffered for his incompetence. Now we have Minister Spencer-Moon and he\u2019s known for his excellence and is likely to win the upcoming elections again.\u201d\n\u201dHe is very well respected and liked,\u201d Harry agreed. \u201dExcept by the purebloods who still keep bringing up how he started out as a tea-boy in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. Either way, we digress. The point isn\u2019t how good or bad someone is as a minister, but rather that aspiring Dark Lords should perhaps try their hand at less destructive methods of gaining power.\u201d\n\u201dI don\u2019t think that we will be reaching a point of agreement on this subject anytime soon,\u201d Tom said stiffly, taking a step back. Somehow, despite their conversation and everything that Harry knew of the man, the smile on Tom\u2019s face was almost lovely. Merlin\u2019s balls, Harry was not used to dealing with attractive people. \u201dI wouldn\u2019t wish to waste your time more than I already have. Good day.\u201d\n\u201dVisit again!\u201d Harry yelled after him cheerfully. Circe, he should have known that Voldemort would be such a huffy person. \u201dOff he goes.\u201d\n\u201dI don\u2019t like him,\u201d the zinnia on the counter said darkly. \u201dI hope he dies in his sleep. After a nightmare.\"\n*\n\u201dWith the amount of time you\u2019re spending here, I\u2019m beginning to feel bad for Mr. Borgin,\u201d Harry mused aloud while treating a sick dandelion with some ointment. The poor thing was wilting fast, presumably of a broken heart.\n\u201dDon\u2019t,\u201d Riddle replied. \u201dI do more in an hour than that man does in a week.\u201d\n\u201dCute of you,\u201d Harry said, smiling when Riddle shot him a glare. \u201dDid you read the paper this morning? Grindelwald\u2019s trial date has been set. Although I\u2019m not quite sure why he\u2019s going to be tried here, and not in Germany where he\u2019s actually from and where he did most of his, uh, work.\u201d\n\u201dLikely because of Dumbledore,\u201d Riddle said. \u201dPerhaps they think that he\u2019s the only one capable of handling him\u2014\u201d\n\u201dBut that doesn\u2019t make any sense either,\u201d Harry protested. \u201dThey could\u2019ve just invited Dumbledore to the trial in Germany. He wouldn\u2019t have refused. And if they\u2019re that worried about their capabilities of keeping Grindelwald contained, how have they been able to jail him so far? He\u2019s been in custody for months!\u201d\n\u201dIf Dumbledore\u2019s the one who asked for Grindelwald to be tried here, the German Ministry of Magic could hardly refuse,\u201d Riddle said. \u201dConsidering that Dumbledore is the one who defeated him.\u201d\n\u201dThat would explain the date, I suppose,\u201d Harry acknowledged. \u201dThe first of August. Well before the school year starts at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\u201dIndeed,\u201d Tom muttered, frowning a bit. \u201dI wonder how many people will manage to attend it - it\u2019ll be quite the event, I expect.\u201d\n\u201dWell, it\u2019s not every day that a Dark Lord gets sentenced to life imprisonment.\u201d\n\u201dLife impri\u2014 Surely he\u2019ll be sentenced to death! Who in their right mind would allow such a risk to live?\u201d\n\u201dI really doubt that he\u2019ll be executed,\u201d Harry said. \u201dDespite the Ministry\u2019s numerous shortcomings, I do believe they\u2019re trying very hard to maintain a strict no-execution rule. Minister Spencer-Moon would never let it happen.\u201d\n\u201dPerhaps he should,\u201d Riddle replied right away. \u201dAllowing Grindelwald to live brings up plenty of unnecessary expenses. The Wizengamot will surely push for the death penalty. Besides if Spencer-Moon is aiming to win the re-election, he can\u2019t be seen as soft.\u201d\n\u201dI\u2019m not saying that a Dark Lord doesn\u2019t deserve the death penalty,\u201d Harry said pleasantly. Because, honestly, he\u2019s been there and done that. \u201dAfter all, killing so many people and doing so much harm to the society... it does deserve a severe punishment, doesn\u2019t it? However I doubt that that will be the sentence Grindelwald will be receiving in the end.\u201d\n\u201dI can only wonder about your confidence regarding his sentencing,\u201d Riddle said, then waved his hand dismissively when he saw Harry about to say something. \u201dDon\u2019t bother. I hardly care. What I am interested in knowing more about is whether or not you\u2019ll be going to watch the event.\u201d\n\u201dWho knows, really,\u201d Harry sighed. \u201dI\u2019m really not in the mood for Dark Lords.\u201d\n\u201dMet a lot of those, have you?\u201d Riddle said dryly.\n\u201dOh, sure,\u201d Harry replied. \u201dEgomaniacs, the lot of them. Obsessed with immortality and revenge and taking over societies without any solid ideas of how to run their new governments \u2013 honestly, it\u2019s a mess of mismanagement. Dark Lords are overrated.\u201d\n\u201dThat\u2019s a rather narrow-minded opinion, isn\u2019t it,\u201d Riddle said, his voice strained. \u201cImmortality? Revenge? Where did you get those from?\u201d\n\u201dDo you disagree?\u201d Harry asked, his voice light. \u201dPerhaps you\u2019re interested in becoming a Dark Lord yourself?\u201d\n\u201dHardly,\u201d Riddle replied immediately. \u201dHowever what I am, is a man of logic. Your sweeping generalisations of what Dark Lords are like are inaccurate and not at all beneficial. Do you even know what Grindelwald aimed to do? I, for one, haven\u2019t heard a thing about wishes for immortality and revenge.\u201d\n\u201dI must have confused him with another Dark Lord, then,\u201d Harry said with a shrug. \u201dAre you planning on going to watch the sentencing?\u201d\n\u201dYes,\u201d Riddle said. \u201dCome with me. Perhaps if you actually listen to his list of crimes, you\u2019ll see that becoming a Dark Lord is quite different from becoming a Minister of Magic.\u201d\n\u201dBut did he become a Dark Lord in order to commit those crimes,\u201d Harry said, \u201dor did he commit those crimes in order to become a Dark Lord? There\u2019s a big difference, you know, and if he became a Dark Lord in order to gain power, he\u2019d be able to gain that power even as a Minister of Magic. In fact, there\u2019s not much an intelligent and a powerful wizard wouldn\u2019t be able to do in that position. Those German wizards, you know. He\u2019s a Durmstrang graduate. If anyone can do it, it\u2019d be him. He\u2019s handsome, too. Now imagine if a Dark Lord came out of Hogwarts. That\u2019d be hilarious.\u201d\nRiddle stared at him for a few long moments, before he took a deep breath and pushed himself away from the counter.\n\u201dSince you\u2019re showing no signs of moving to better areas for selling flowers, I trust you\u2019ll be here a week from now on?\u201d Riddle said. \u201dI\u2019ll pick you up from here and we\u2019ll go watch the sentencing together. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be very informative for you.\u201d\n\u201dSure,\u201d Harry said. \u201dDon\u2019t wait a week before you visit me again, though. I\u2019ll grow lonely.\u201d\n\u201dIf you had more clients, which you would have in Diagon Alley,\u201d Riddle said, heading towards the door, \u201dyou\u2019d be too busy to miss me there.\u201d\n\u201dYou might just underestimate your impact, Mr. Riddle,\u201d Harry yelled, just as the door swung shut. He then sighed, and shook his head. \u201dAnd going by how frequently you visit me, you\u2019d miss me too.\u201d\nIn all honesty, Harry wasn\u2019t entirely sure as to why Riddle kept coming back. His attempts at convincing Harry to leave for Diagon Alley or another, allegedly better, place for business were half-hearted at best. Something, however, kept bringing him back. Whatever that thing was, Harry hoped it\u2019d continue attracting Riddle back to the store - the man was interesting company, in spite of, well, who he was.\nIf nothing else, he was at least a better conversationalist than a zinnia with anger issues.\n*\n\n1st of August\n\n\u201dI still don\u2019t understand why this couldn\u2019t be done in Germany,\u201d Harry muttered as he pushed through the gathered crowds, Riddle leading the way right in front of him. \u201dAre you sure we can just muscle our way to the front like this?\u201d\n\u201dNot if you\u2019re alone, no,\u201d Riddle replied, pulling Harry closer as they kept moving. \u201dBut I happen to have friends in high places. Certainly in places high enough to get us seats, rather than leave us standing among all these people for hours to come. All we need to do is get to the front, find a\u2014 you know what? Just follow me.\u201d\nAs odd as it was to voluntarily follow Voldemort\u2019s orders, Harry agreed to do so. In perhaps half an hour they were both seated at a booth high enough for Harry to be able to see the platform clearly without having to stand up. Grindelwald was nowhere to be seen yet, but Dumbledore was easy to recognize.\n\u201dThese are quite the seats you got us,\u201d Harry said. Riddle shrugged with a smug look on his face.\n\u201dNaturally,\u201d was all he said, before a sudden rise in the noise around them made Harry look back down at the stage. A man, standing tall and proud despite the shackles on his wrists and ankles, was being led by a team of aurors to some sort of a public holding cell. The air around the thing rippled, indicating the presence of a protective shield, intended to prevent any vengeful viewers from cursing the prisoner.\n\u201dThat\u2019s him,\u201d Riddle murmured, leaning closer. \u201dGellert Grindelwald. The greatest Dark Lord ever, according to history writers.\u201d\n\u201dOf course they\u2019d call him that,\u201d Harry replied, thinking of the devastation Voldemort had left behind. \u201dThey have to sell their books somehow. If dramatic declarations are the way to do it, then hey, why not?\u201d\n\u201dYou\u2019re really not impressed by his... actions as a Dark Lord, are you?\u201d Riddle asked, turning to look at Harry with a contemplative expression. \u201dLook at the people around us. Look at the judge, for Merlin\u2019s sake. Even the jury are shaking under their ridiculous hats.\u201d\n\u201dOf course he\u2019s fearsome,\u201d Harry admitted, strangely enough sounding as if he didn\u2019t consider Grindelwald fearsome at all. \u201dBut what finesse does being a Dark Lord require? It\u2019s such blunt, rough business. Brutal. You kill hundreds, if not thousands, of the people you could have ruled. You blow up a couple of places, stage a hostile takeover at a ministry or two, win everything at a wandpoint - and that\u2019s actually the easiest part, so far! He failed at taking over the societies he tried to enslave, and is now going to lose his freedom for it. If you lose a political race, you can always try again.\u201d\n\u201dYou\u2019ve really thought about this, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Riddle said, shaking his head before turning back to look at the events unfolding below. \u201dYou consider leading a revolution the easy part? What then, in your opinion, is the hard part?\u201d\n\u201dMaintaining order,\u201d Harry replied instantly. \u201dConvincing the thousands of people who hate him for his actions to see him as a legitimate ruler without losing them and ending up a king to a wasteland. Well, in his case that is not going to happen anymore. They could have sentenced him in Germany. Or even here, but privately. They could have declared his sentence after all the evidence had been reviewed and the trials were over. But no, instead we get this... spectacle. This show. His crimes are listed to an enormous audience to make sure we\u2019re properly offended and shocked, and then his sentence will be read aloud. Ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201dWell, as you said, it\u2019s all over for him now,\u201d Riddle said. \u201dConsider this his last show. No need to worry about Dark Lords after this, right?\u201d\n\u201dI doubt it,\u201d Harry said, leaning suddenly closer to Riddle, who could smell the scent of flowers on him now. It was slightly distracting in ways Riddle wasn\u2019t sure how to deal with. \u201dDark Lords come and go. I guarantee you that unless Britain\u2019s next minister is someone who\u2019s capable of being an actual ruler, we\u2019ll be stuck with another delusional, illogical and reckless wizard aiming to become a Dark Lord.\u201d\n\u201dThat\u2019s quite the prediction,\u201d Riddle murmured, with a new kind of tension in his demeanour. \u201dOh, look, they\u2019re done with his crimes now. Let\u2019s see about that sentence.\u201d\nHarry focused on the judge who, for some reason, kept glancing at Dumbledore as he was about to reveal the sentence. Harry sighed, relaxing enough to lean more against Riddle, who didn\u2019t seem to either care or notice. He hadn\u2019t intended on trying to make becoming a Dark Lord sound unappealing to Riddle - he wasn\u2019t here for that. But... well, his own reality was already part of a different universe, so why couldn\u2019t he try and make things better for the future of this world?\n\u2019Then again, Riddle as the Minister of Magic,\u2019 Harry thought, shuddering. \u2019Merlin knows how that would end up.\u2019\n\u201dLook at that, you were right,\u201d Riddle said suddenly. \u201dLife sentence in Nurmengard. Idiots.\u201d\n\u201dDumbledore is a fan of mercy and second chances,\u201d Harry said, straightening up in his seat. \u201dHe wouldn\u2019t allow Grindelwald to be killed.\u201d\n\u201dSecond chances shouldn\u2019t matter in a scenario involving big risks like him,\u201d Riddle hissed, clearly annoyed. \u201dHe\u2019s a loose end.\u201d\n\u201dYou know, it doesn\u2019t matter what you think,\u201d Harry said, patting Riddle\u2019s cheek in a condescending manner. \u201dAfter all you\u2019re not a law-maker. You\u2019re not part of the ministry. If you were the minister himself, well, you could change things. But as you are now... get used to complaining, dear.\u201d\n\u201dWhy would I want to become the minister?\u201d Riddle scoffed. \u201dThe campaigns that I\u2019d have to run. The speeches. Putting up with the pompous idiots who believe their ignorant ideas to be worth something... Who\u2019d want to voluntarily subject themselves to that?\u201d\n\u201dWhether or not you want to is up to you, of course,\u201d Harry said. \u201dI\u2019m quite sure, however, that if you put your mind into it... you could.\u201d\n\u201dSuch confidence,\u201d Riddle said, shaking his head. \u201dCome on, the ordeal is over. Lunch? At Diagon Alley, of course.\u201d\n\u201dWould be great,\u201d Harry agreed. \u201dAnd don\u2019t try to lead me past available spaces for shops. I\u2019m not moving from Knockturn Alley.\u201d\n*\nAt this point in life, Harry didn\u2019t regret many things.\nOne of the things he did regret, however, was thinking that Tom Riddle could ever be a likable person.\nIt was well into August, and there were plenty of shoppers heading to the area for various purposes. Even Harry\u2019s little flower shop had gained unexpected popularity, for some reason among hags in particular. He didn\u2019t question it, of course - simply did his business with a pleasant smile and a cheerful suggestion to come back soon.\nOn that particular day, for some odd reason, Harry\u2019s first client didn\u2019t step into the store until noon. Harry, who had been working at the backroom, greeted the unkempt looking man with a bright smile.\n\u201dHello! Are you looking for anything specific?\u201d\n\u201dJust something nice for my wife,\u201d the man replied, taking off his hat and scratching his head. \u201dThat poor fool, the past few years were quite tough on her.\u201d\n\u201dIndeed,\u201d Harry said with a sigh. He knew the stress a war could have on people, even if they weren\u2019t fighting in the front lines. Especially if the woman had any children in the army. \u201dQuite rough on most of us, I believe, but parents especially. Have you got a particular flower in mind?\u201d\n\u201dNah, not really,\u201d the man said. \u201dSomething pink, I suppose, she likes that colour. I hadn\u2019t planned on even getting a flower, you see.\u201d He then gestured towards the window. \u201cBut the crowd outside caught my attention, and I saw your shop and thought \u2013 hey, what the hell. Might as well cheer her up, you know?\u201d\n\u201dCrowd?\u201d Harry murmured, and turned to take a look from the window. He was surprised to see people swarming outside Borgin and Burkes, lining up to enter the place and blocking the way to Harry\u2019s shop while doing so. No wonder there were no clients coming in! What on earth was going on?\nDoing his best to refocus on finding the perfect flower for his customer, Harry tried to ignore the commotion going on outside, and push his curiosity aside. This couldn\u2019t be a coincidence \u2013 somehow, he wasn\u2019t yet sure how, this must have been Riddle\u2019s move. Why, though? Sure, he wanted Harry away from Knockturn Alley, but why increase his efforts now? Harry had thought that they had begun to actually, perhaps, get along to some degree. Why would he want Harry to leave, anyway? He had no reasons to be suspicious or wary of him!\n\u2019Figures,\u2019 Harry thought bitterly. \u2019Can\u2019t trust a man with a pretty face like that. It\u2019s Voldemort, for Merlin\u2019s sake.\u2019\nDone with his client, Harry stood behind the counter and began taking care of the injured leaves of a rare Amazighian cactus from the desert of Libya. The number of people walking in and out of Borgin and Burkes didn\u2019t\u2019 seem to decrease as the day went on, preventing Harry\u2019s clients for coming in at all. It was frustrating, and it had to stop. Harry couldn\u2019t waste his entire day waiting for a miracle to happen - he had to go and do something, clearly.\n\u201dHoe don\u2019t do it,\u201d the zinnia on the counter croaked. \u201dDon\u2019t pick fights with neighbours. Even us reapers know that.\u201d\n\u201dI\u2019m not picking a fight with my neighbour,\u201d Harry replied. \u201dI\u2019m merely... going to investigate as to why my neighbour is picking a fight with me.\u201d\n\u201dThis doesn\u2019t sound good at all,\u201d the zinnia protested. \u201dListen, I know he\u2019s\u2014oh, what the hell. Fine. Go kill him.\u201d\nThough he closed early, Harry waited until the afternoon to cross the street and enter the dark and dingy store, only to see most shelves empty and Riddle standing by the cash register with an annoyingly self-satisfied air about him. When he saw Harry walking towards him, the man smiled.\nFuck. He had dimples.\nFuck.\n\u201dDidn\u2019t expect to see you here,\u201d Riddle said. \u201dAnything I can help you with?\u201d\n\u201dNot really, no,\u201d Harry replied. \u201dCouldn\u2019t help but notice the sudden popularity of your shop. Are you selling something new or did you bother advertising somewhere?\u201d\n\u201dNeither,\u201d Riddle replied. \u201dWe\u2019ve got a sale going on. The storage is overflowing and it was a good time to clear up the shelves for new items.\u201d\n\u201dLovely,\u201d Harry murmured, narrowing his eyes at the man. \u201dI\u2019m sure your clients are happy.\u201d\n\u201dOh, they are,\u201d Riddle assured him, before moving to stand next to Harry, and then leading him further into the shop with a hand pressed against the small of his back. \u201dCould I interest you in any of our items? This decorative crystal drop, for example. As you can see, a human fetus has been immortalized inside it. It\u2019s one of a kind.\u201d\n\u201dI do hope it\u2019s one of a kind,\u201d Harry said with a grimace. \u201dWho on earth would want to make a second one of those?\u201d\n\u201dYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d Riddle replied with a grin. Even his teeth were nice, Harry thought. Merlin, how infuriating.\n\u201dHow long is this... sale going to last?\u201d Harry asked then, taking a step away from the other wizard and closer to the exit. \u201dIs it only for today? The weekend?\u201d\nRiddle shrugged, feigning nonchalance. \u201dWell, at first we thought it\u2019d only be for the weekend,\u201d he said, brushing his perfectly neat fringe to the side a bit. \u201dBut this has been such a success and we\u2019re getting rid of so many unnecessary items that we\u2019ll extend the sale by a few days. Until Wednesday, I believe. I hope it\u2019s not interfering with your business?\u201d\n\u201dYou know bloody well that it is,\u201d Harry hissed, scowling at the man. \u201dBut if you think this is your victory, just you wait, Riddle. You haven\u2019t seen anything yet.\u201d\n\u201dGoodness, and here I thought we were friends,\u201d Riddle said mockingly. \u201dCan\u2019t we just get along? As neighbours in this very pleasant nook of Knockturn Alley?\u201d\n\u201dOh, sure, if you want to leave it at that,\u201d Harry replied, wanting nothing more than to wipe that confident look off the other man\u2019s face. He plastered on a sweet smile and continued: \u201dThis killed just about any ounce of attraction I had towards you. Goodbye.\u201d\nHe then left, slamming the door shut and leaving a wide-eyed Tom Riddle behind him.\n*\nRiddle\u2019s sale did, indeed, continue until Wednesday. Thankfully by then the number of clients had returned back to normal for both Harry\u2019s shop and Borgin and Burkes despite the reduced prices. Riddle hadn\u2019t come to visit, and Harry wasn\u2019t sure how to feel about that. Unexpectedly, he had grown quite used to the man\u2019s visit, despite knowing who he was and what he was planning on doing. Not to mention that Harry hadn\u2019t exactly lied when he had called Riddle handsome.\n\u201cYou wish it had been a lie,\u201d the zinnia said, packing an unfair amount of judgement into those words.\nWhat Harry was sure about, however, was that he would need to strike back one way or another. What Riddle had pulled with that sale of his had seriously made Harry\u2019s business suffer for those few days, and if he hadn\u2019t been lucky enough to have his own money in the bank as a back-up, he\u2019d be in quite the pinch with his bills. Harry couldn\u2019t let this slide, and frankly\u2026 hadn\u2019t he come back in time specifically to make Riddle a little bit less comfortable with his life?\nOn that week\u2019s Friday Tom went to work with a strange feeling at the pit of his stomach. When he opened the store early in the morning, he saw that the flower shop was still closed. Not only that, but the skeletons guarding the door were dressed in black robes, and there was a large black ribbon hanging off the window. It wasn\u2019t a sight Tom was used to, but he wasn\u2019t sure what it meant.\nWhen people, well, hags, streetrats, beggars and all sorts of oddities began gathering in front of the shop, Tom noticed immediately. What he also noticed was that everyone was, without exception, wearing mostly black. Some had obviously used a little bit of coal to aid them in matching what seemed to be the chosen colour of the day. They walked in and out of the flower shop, and strangely enough, didn\u2019t leave the area despite exiting the store.\nIt took Tom a few moments before he noticed that the ones who exited the flower shop were holding cups and small platefuls of what looked like pastries.\n\u2019What on earth is going on?\u2019 Tom thought, hesitantly heading towards the door. The last customer had dropped by a long time ago, and it was clear to him that whatever Harry was up to, it wasn\u2019t good for the store\u2019s business. Borgin wouldn\u2019t be pleased. It was quite lucky that the owner had a trip that kept him away from the shop for a few days, and the thought of putting up with his whining wasn\u2019t appealing in the least. \u2019There\u2019s no way he\u2019s having a sale. These things wouldn\u2019t gather here for cheap flowers.\u2019\nAfter a brief moment of hesitation, Tom pushed the door of the store open, and stepped outside. Right away he almost bumped into a pair of hags occupied with shoving a mountain of pastries into their mouths, making a right mess out of it with no shame. Despite the disgust Tom felt, he mustered up a charming smile and turned to the one standing closer to him.\n\u201dExcuse me,\u201d he said. \u201dQuite the gathering you all seem have going on here.\u201d\n\u201dExcused,\u201d the hag replied, partly chewed food visible as she spoke.\n\u201dI was wondering what has brought on this\u2026 lovely meeting?\u201d Tom asked. \u201dIs it a sale of some sort?\u201d\n\u201dI\u2019m here for the food,\u201d the hag said, and wiped her mouth with a tuft of her hair before continuing: \u201dIt\u2019s a party. We\u2019re celebrating the death of Mister Harry\u2019s pet.\u201d\n\u201dFuneral,\u201d the other hag said. \u201dI think it\u2019s called a funeral. The food is great. Didn\u2019t like the drink at all, though. Too watery and hot.\u201d\n\u2019His pet died?\u2019 Tom thought. \u2019I didn\u2019t even know he had a pet.\u2019 Somehow Harry didn\u2019t seem like the kind of a man to keep a pet around, what with him spending most of his days tending to flowers.\nStill deep in thought, Tom retreated back into the store as fast as he could without making it too obvious. He didn\u2019t particularly care about animals, although the thought of losing his own did make him frown a bit. Perhaps he could allow Harry his time to grieve, even if it came at the expense of his clients for one day. It was fine. One day was fine.\nBesides, after the hustle and bustle of the previous weekend and the few days following it, the comfortable silence was a pleasant change. He could spend the hours inspecting the new items on the shelves, perhaps read a book or two that he wouldn\u2019t be able to buy for himself. It was only for one day, and Borgin wouldn\u2019t even need to know.\n*\nThe following Friday arrived, and with it another crowd of oddities interrupting the best business hours of Borgin and Burkes. Unlike the previous week, however, now Borgin was present, and he was far from amused and understanding.\n\u201dWhat in bloody Circe\u2019s name is happening,\u201d the old wizard wheezed in rage. \u201dIs it that florist? Is he the one who\u2014 of course it\u2019s him. Tom! Go and put a stop to this! The audacity of this fool. This is ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201dYes sir,\u201d Tom replied, keeping his own temper in check. \u201dShould I finish going through the inventory first, or...?\u201d\n\u201dNo, no, I\u2019ll do that this time,\u201d Borgin said. \u201dOff you go.\u201d\nTom stepped out of the store fully intending on not only ignoring the pair of trolls fist fighting over a plateful of some sort of sweets, but also going nowhere near the gaggle of hags playing a game that involved far too many broken bones for Tom to find it remotely interesting. As soon as he entered the flower shop, he saw Harry by the counter, staring a small coffin on the table. The other wizard was dressed in all black, the only splash of colour coming from a lily tucked into his hair.\nHe was\u2026 he\u2026 well, he wasn\u2019t particularly not pretty, Tom noted.\n\u201dIs it a bad time?\u201d he asked, walking closer towards the counter. Harry looked up and shrugged.\n\u201dIt\u2019s always a bad time in my life,\u201d he said morosely. \u201dWhat do you want?\u201d\n\u201dTo find out what\u2019s happening here.\u201d\n\u201dA funeral. My beloved pet passed away.\u201d\n\u2019Again?\u2019 Tom thought, feeling slightly sceptical about the situation. \u201dDidn\u2019t that happen last week?\u201d\n\u201dWow,\u201d a, uh, was that a... well, a flower suddenly said, its tinny voice full of contempt. \u201dYou brazen hussy.\u201d\n\u201dPardon?\u201d Tom asked, stunned, before shaking his head and turning away from the flower to stare at Harry instead. And Merlin, standing so close to him made it even more obvious that the man looked irritatingly good in his black robes. And he smelled good. Really good. Why. \u201dExplain.\u201d\n\u201dFlowers die every week, Thomas,\u201d Harry sniffed.\n\u201dThat... is not my name,\u201d Tom said. \u201dTom is not short of anything. Besides, what does that have\u2014 oh, no.\u201d He then took a deep breath to calm down, before reaching for the small coffin on the table. If his assumption was right, then Merlin be damned, he was going to pull out his wand and hex this irritating man regardless of how pretty or entertaining he was.\nWhich he wasn\u2019t. Pretty. Or entertaining. He wasn\u2019t.\n\u201dSome people keep rocks as pets,\u201d Harry hurried to say. \u201dAnything can be a pet if you love it enough.\u201d\n\u201dThat is not how it works,\u201d Tom hissed, and the few other people who had been loitering in the flower shop seemed to finally sense something amiss, as they hurried outside with alarmed looks on their faces. \u201dThat is. Not. How. It works.\u201d\n\u201dThat\u2019s how I work, mate,\u201d Harry replied. \u201dI\u2019m a sensitive soul, you see. I cherish all my pets and grieve when I lose them.\u201d\n\u201dYou and I both know what this is about,\u201d Tom said, resisting the urge to slam his fist on the counter and chuck the little coffin outside. \u201dAll this for the sale that I had? This farce in response to a perfectly legitimate business event?\u201d\n\u201dOh, but you and I both know that\u2019s not the whole situation,\u201d Harry replied. \u201dContext, my dear friend. Context is important. That sale wasn\u2019t just a sale, but a ploy to make my earnings plummet. Knowing that makes the situation a bit different, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201dIsn\u2019t this a bit excessive?\u201d Tom insisted. \u201dDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re overreacting a little bit?\u201d\n\u201dYou\u2019d know about that, wouldn\u2019t you,\u201d Harry snorted, and what did he even mean by that? \u201dFeel free to host another sale if you wish. My business is blooming, and I have no reason to leave this place.\u201d\n\u201dYou know what? Fine,\u201d Tom relented, scowling as he stepped away from the counter. \u201dDo what you wish. Let\u2019s see for how long you can survive here. These tricks will not be enough to keep you in business for long.\u201d\n\u201dLet me worry about that,\u201d Harry said. \u201dYou can go back to doing, well, whatever it is that you\u2019re doing when you\u2019re not trying to defend dark lords to me.\u201d\n\u201dI have not defended\u2014\u201d\n\u201dSure.\u201d\n\u201dNo, listen,\u201d Riddle insisted, leaning closer again. Merlin, his hair looked great. Harry found that really annoying and, to some degree, distracting. Just a bit. \u201dI do understand your point of view. I simply do not think that being a Dark Lord and being a Minister of Magic are that similar.\u201d\n\u201dThey\u2019re not identical,\u201d Harry agreed, \u201dbut what would you, as a Dark Lord, wish to do that you wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve as a Minister of Magic?\u201d\nRiddle shot him a dark look, before he sighed heavily and closed his eyes, clearly exhausted. \u201dYou wouldn\u2019t understand. What\u2019s your interest in understanding his logic, anyway? He failed, he\u2019s no longer a Dark Lord.\u201d\n\u201dAnd who\u2019s to say that another Dark Lord won\u2019t pop up right after him?\u201d Harry asked. \u201dAnd then we\u2019re back to a cycle of death and terror.\u201d\n\u201dThat\u2019s a bit unrealistic, isn\u2019t it,\u201d Riddle replied. \u201dYou\u2019re making it sound as if the next Grindelwald will bring war upon us. That\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration, isn\u2019t it? Especially considering that there\u2019s no way to know what the future will bring.\u201d\n\u2019You arse,\u2019 Harry thought. \u2019We both know what you\u2019re aiming for.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t that Riddle appeared to be particularly supportive of Grindelwald, or zealously against him. On the contrary, if Harry didn\u2019t know the things he knew about Riddle, he\u2019d simply assume that the man was like any other wizard, at times playing the devil\u2019s advocate and attempting to study the situation from different angles. Someone simply trying to analyse the actions of a Dark Lord while woefully ignorant of the devastation he had brought.\n\u201dWell, I don\u2019t have time to discuss this with you again right now,\u201d Riddle said. \u201dI have work to do. Just... no more funerals, all right?\u201d\n\u201dDon\u2019t tell me what to do,\u201d Harry said. \u201dI greet death like an old friend, every week if I have to.\u201d\n*\nThe next funeral took place exactly a week later.\nTo be quite honest, Harry had already grown tired of the whole thing, and had Tom not told him to not do this again, he wouldn\u2019t have bothered. At least more people kept coming quite regularly to the flower shop now, and Mr. Borgin seemed to have given up on trying to chase him away - at least the man didn\u2019t glare at him as much as he used to, anymore. Curiously, Riddle didn\u2019t turn up at all for a while either.\n\u2019Did he give up?\u2019 Harry thought suddenly. Surprisingly, the thought of that wasn\u2019t quite as satisfying as Harry had expected it to be.\nIt was two days later when Riddle stepped in through the door. Unlike the previous times, however, now there was... something different about him. Seemingly calm and composed, it took Harry a moment to realize what exactly had changed: unlike before, when Riddle had wandered in full of confidence and misplaced anger and unexplored issues, now he came in like a man on a mission.\n\u201dI\u2019m here to buy a flower,\u201d Riddle said, and Harry, in his shock, almost dropped the possessed zinnia he had been holding. The other wizard didn\u2019t appear to find anything wrong in his request, and quite frankly - there wasn\u2019t. It was just odd to have a future Dark Lord buying flowers. Harry couldn\u2019t imagine Voldemort doing such a thing.\n\u201dCareful,\u201d the zinnia snapped, its tinny voice barely audible. \u201dI might be a reaper but I can\u2019t survive a fall like this.\u201d\n\u201dA flower,\u201d Harry repeated, wondering who the flower could be for. Voldemort hadn\u2019t... dated anyone, had he? Wait, really, had he? Dumbledore had said that Riddle hadn\u2019t had a single meaningful relationship in his life, but how true was that, really? \u201dSure. Anything specific in mind?\u201d\n\u201dPoint me to the flower you consider your current... pet,\u201d Riddle said, clearly up to something. \u201dI want to buy it. Name your price.\u201d\n\u201dFour galleons, seven knuts,\u201d Harry replied after a moment of silent contemplation. He then pointed at cluster of lilies, preening by the window and seeking sunlight. \u201dThat one, yes, the white one that\u2019s drooping a little bit. That\u2019s my favourite. And she costs four galleons and seven knuts, but you know what? We\u2019re friends, so I\u2019ll give you a special price: six galleons.\u201d\n\u201dAre you out of your mind?\u201d Riddle snapped. \u201dThat\u2019s not how\u2014 that\u2019s an outrageous price for a single flower!\u201d\n\u201dThe times are hard,\u201d Harry replied easily. \u201dBesides, it\u2019s my beloved pet, Thomas. How dare you ask me to sell my pet? It\u2019s like my own child.\u201d\n\u201dYou already gave me a price \u2013 as ridiculous as that price is. It\u2019s too late to pretend to mourn over that thing now.\u201d\n\u201dIf you\u2019d rather not pay, you\u2019re free to go and pick your own flower off a field. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find plenty.\u201d\n\u201dI\u2019ll take it,\u201d Riddle said, rolling his eyes in a gesture that reminded Harry strongly of Ron, of all people. Riddle was nothing like his best friend, however, and the resemblance faded into nothing in an instant. \u201dBut I want it in a pot, not cut. You can do that, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201dYes I can,\u201d Harry replied, moving to prepare a pot before extracting the lily from its current place. \u201dI use magic, you see.\u201d\n\u201dI hate you so much,\u201d Riddle hissed, dropping six galleons onto the counter. \u201dJust... get it done. Don\u2019t pretend to get emotional over this - we both know you\u2019ll just switch to a different flower once I walk out of here.\u201d\n\u201dWell, actually,\u201d Harry said, \u201dlilies are my favourites. I\u2019ll wait until you tell me that this one passed away before I pick my next one.\u201d\n\u201dYou have a favourite flower,\u201d Riddle said, sounding strangely... disapproving? \u201dMerlin, did you actually grow up surrounded by girls or what exactly happened to make you this interested in flowers?\u201d\n\u201dFirstly, it\u2019s perfectly normal for men to be interested in flowers. Secondly, my mum\u2019s name was Lily,\u201d Harry replied easily. \u201dShe died when I was one. I grew up at my aunt\u2019s place, and she often sent me to take care of the garden.\u201d\n\u201dDelightful,\u201d Riddle said, clearly not moved by what he had heard. \u201dTry to hold off on the funerals until this one dies, will you?\u201d\n\u201dOf course,\u201d Harry agreed, wrapping the base of the pot with some paper. \u201dLet\u2019s see how long it\u2019ll survive in your care. Do drop by again in a couple of days. I\u2019m thinking salty treats for the next funeral.\u201d\n\u201dDon\u2019t place any orders yet,\u201d Riddle said, reaching for the now ready-to-go lily. \u201dI\u2019d hate for you to waste your money.\u201d\n\u201dNo need to worry about my money, darling,\u201d Harry said. \u201dAnd hold it from the bottom, yes, like that. Thank you for your patronage and have a good day, sir!\u201d\n\u201dThat is the least sincere thing you\u2019ve ever said to me,\u201d Riddle told him while heading towards the door, walking backwards to keep facing Harry. \u201dBe kinder to your neighbours.\u201d\n\u201dI don\u2019t want to hear that from you,\u201d Harry yelled after him, and sighed when the door swung shut, leaving him alone in the flower shop once again. His friendly relationship with Riddle hadn\u2019t been what he had expected to develop when he had come to this time and day, but he didn\u2019t mind it, really. He had already killed Voldemort - who had been responsible of his parents\u2019 deaths - once, and found it alarmingly easy to separate who Riddle was and who he would become.\nNow if only Harry could manage to convince him of the merits of being a Minister of Magic, instead of a Dark Lord. But really.... how likely was that to succeed?\n*\nAnother few days passed without Tom dropping by to visit. All Harry saw of him were glimpses of whenever he left the store, either to go back home - wherever that was - or to run some errands. It didn\u2019t seem that he was ignoring Harry, though. Rather, he seemed to be deep in thought and constantly preoccupied with something. Was he, perhaps, re-evaluating his goals?\n\u201dDon\u2019t get your hopes up,\u201d the zinnia said, flexing its leaves casually. \u201dRemember who he is. Voldemort was nothing but a series of disappointments. Even his dad didn\u2019t want him.\u201d\n\u201dThat... is complicated,\u201d Harry replied, unsure of how to defend a mass murderer. If he even wanted to. \u201dYou\u2019re taking things out of context. What did Death leave you here for, anyway?\u201d\n\u201dTo offer you guidance and wisdom,\u201d the zinnia replied instantly. \u201dNeither of which you\u2019re willing to accept into your life, so here we are.\u201d\n\u201dDid Death really expect me to learn wisdom and guidance from you?\u201d Harry asked, deeply sceptical about these claims. \u201dNone of that has been forthcoming from your corner, anyway.\u201d\n\u201dI resent your attitude, friend,\u201d the zinnia said. \u201dBesides-- oh, look who\u2019s coming back. Speak of the devil and he shall appear, hair combed to slick perfection as always.\u201d\nHarry turned when he heard the door being pushed open, and, much to his delight, it was Riddle. The man was dressed in his usual robes, his dark hair neatly combed back. It was odd, in Harry\u2019s opinion, how a man who looked like he\u2019d much rather study dusty tomes in libraries than fight the world with his own hands could be capable of causing not one, but two wars. He didn\u2019t look violent and dangerous, the way people like Fenrir Greyback and Bellatrix Lestrange had looked.\nNow he was back, and he was holding a very healthy potted lily in his hands.\n\u201dI see that\u2019s still alive,\u201d Harry said, wiping his palms against his apron. \u201dSomething wrong with my darling pet?\u201d\n\u201dNothing\u2019s wrong with it,\u201d Riddle said, and set the pot down on the counter. \u201dNo need to arrange another funeral.\u201d\n\u201dWell, that\u2019s a good thing, I suppose,\u201d Harry sighed. \u201dWhat can I help you with, then?\u201d\n\u201dYou said this is your, well, favourite flower,\u201d Riddle started. \u201dYou also said that this is your pet. I know it was a lie, that you\u2019re simply doing this to irritate me, but you also said that you won\u2019t hold another funeral as long as this thing lives.\u201d\n\u201dYes, I did say that,\u201d Harry agreed, wondering where this was going. Had Riddle done something to the flower to keep it so fresh? Why had he brought it back to the store?\n\u201dI want you to keep this on that shelf behind you,\u201d Riddle said, pushing the lily forward. \u201dDon\u2019t sell it. It\u2019s still mine. Or rather, it\u2019s ours. It\u2019s mine enough for you to not sell it, and yours enough for it to be a pet.\u201d\n\u201dAnd when it dies?\u201d Harry asked, not against the idea of co-owning something with Riddle, strangely enough. Perhaps he could use this new connection as another way to shift him towards a life of less crime? \u201dWill you attend the funeral?\u201d\n\u201dIt won\u2019t die,\u201d Riddle replied confidently. \u201dI charmed it myself. It won\u2019t die.\u201d\n\u201dSo let me get this right,\u201d Harry replied, feeling some strange fluttering inside of him. The last time he had felt like this had been years ago, when he had injured his foot in a Quidditch match, and Ginny had picked him up and carried him to the closest chair to sit down and rest. \u201dYou\u2019re giving me a flower \u2013 my favourite flower \u2013 that you\u2019ve charmed to never wilt?\u201d\n\u201dDon\u2019t make it sound like, well, that,\u201d Riddle snapped, a pinkish hue appearing on his face. Was he blushing? \u201dI simply don\u2019t want to see another one of your funerals disturbing our business again.\u201d\n\u201dThis kind of magic is quite incredible,\u201d Harry sighed, poking the lily with his fingertips. \u201dI\u2019m impressed.\u201d\n\u201dPlants are easy to immortalize,\u201d Riddle said. \u201dThey\u2019re simple enough, their functions easy to strengthen and maintain. But animals? Much harder. And quite pointless.\u201d\n\u2019What about people?\u2019 Harry wanted to ask, but couldn\u2019t bring himself to do so. Instead he looked at Riddle and said: \u201dYou sound quite knowledgeable of these things.\u201d\n\u201dI know plenty more,\u201d Riddle replied. \u201dI enjoy learning about magic, that is all. And you never know when a spell is needed to make roses last forever. Or well, lilies, in your case.\u201d\n\u201dThat would be such a romantic thing to hear if you weren\u2019t the source,\u201d Harry sighed. \u201dUnless there\u2019s someone you are trying to woo?\u201d\nAt that, Riddle looked at him with a deeply unimpressed expression. \u201dNo,\u201d he said, with sudden aggression in his tone. \u201dMerlin, there\u2019s absolutely no one I\u2019m trying to... woo... with flowers and halfway interesting conversations.\u201d\n\u201dYou know, you\u2019re quite handsome,\u201d Harry observed. \u201dIf you actually did give someone flowers and talked to them about interesting things, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019d be doing quite well.\u201d\n\u201dImagine that,\u201d Riddle said flatly. \u201dI suppose politics aren\u2019t just interesting enough for some people.\u201d\n\u201dSorry to hear that,\u201d Harry said, full of sympathy despite how it bothered him to think of Riddle having a love interest somewhere. \u201dHave you tried asking this person for an outing of some sort? Lunch? Dinner?\u201d\n\u201dI\u2019d much rather attend the minister candidates\u2019 debate than simply have lunch or dinner,\u201d Riddle said. \u201dYou\u2019ve heard of it, haven\u2019t you? The ministry is hosting an event of some sort in which the two remaining candidates for the position of the next minister of magic will be debating on some issues. It\u2019s going to be open for public and the fastest people will get seats.\u201d\n\u201dOh, right,\u201d Harry realized. \u201dI had forgotten about that. Merlin, I wouldn\u2019t mind watching that. Did you know someone in the ministry had suggested foregoing the elections and just giving the position to Dumbledore? For defeating Grindelwald? He declined, of course.\u201d\n\u201dI did hear about that, yes,\u201d Riddle said with a grimace. \u201dI\u2019m glad he declined. But say, the debate is on next Saturday. Would you like to come with me?\u201d\n\u201dYeah, sure,\u201d Harry agreed. \u201dIf you don\u2019t mind going with me instead of whoever you\u2019re interested in. If you are, that is. Interested in anyone. You never really said.\u201d\nRiddle sighed.\n\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up,\u201d was all he said.\n*\n\u201dSo Spencer-Moon is running again, we know that for sure, right?\u201d Harry asked, settling down onto his seat. Next to him Riddle was already scowling at the still empty stage. Around them countless people were talking loudly and doing their best to find someplace to sit at. \u201dWho\u2019s the other candidate?\u201d\n\u201dCurtis Punnet,\u201d Riddle replied. \u201dA spineless vermin of a person. He\u2019s Fawley\u2019s nephew, and shares plenty of traits with his uncle.\u201d\n\u201dYou know him?\u201d\n\u201dWe\u2019ve met.\u201d\n\u201dSpencer-Moon is likely to win, right? The people trust him and he has done quite well so far as a minister,\u201d Harry said. \u201dWhat could motivate people to leave that and pick Punnet instead?\u201d\n\u201dPunnet is a pureblood who doesn\u2019t particularly like Muggles or muggle-borns,\u201d Riddle explained. \u201dHe\u2019s wealthy, easy to manipulate by smarter and stronger purebloods and would happily attempt to pass some very controversial laws if he got the chance.\u201d\n\u201dHow do you know this?\u201d Harry asked, curious. \u201dYou said you\u2019ve met... did you talk?\u201d\n\u201dHe visited Hogwarts a few years ago, when I was still a student\u201d Riddle said. \u201dGave an alumni speech of sorts at an event. Slughorn invited him back when Punnet was, well, the nephew of the minister. After that we spoke a bit, yes. He was very impressed by Malfoy, and agreed with him on everything despite being much older. The curious thing about always agreeing with others is that... it doesn\u2019t really give a particularly smart idea of someone.\u201d\n\u2019Impressed by Malfoy, but not by you,\u2019 Harry thought. \u2019No wonder you\u2019re mad. That would hurt your pride, wouldn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u201dDoes this mean that wealthy Purebloods will be voting for Punnet, then?\u201d\n\u201dNot just the wealthy ones,\u201d Riddle replied, pulling Harry closer as the noise around them increased. \u201dEven the poor, the trash of society, the ignorant and the uneducated who blame their failures on others. And worst of all \u2013 the narrow-minded academics who live in a delusion of being far more intellectual than they actually are. The ones who parade their prejudice and pretend it\u2019s backed by reason. It never is. Those people will vote for Punnet, because they think he\u2019ll somehow benefit them.\u201d\n\u201dWill he?\u201d\n\u201dNo, of course not. He\u2019ll settle into his seat, cater to the rich at the expense of everyone else, and the people wanting to vote for him now will slowly realize that he brought them no solutions. Only bad management, and a probable financial crisis.\u201d\n\u201dWhat about Spencer-Moon, then? Why wouldn\u2019t people vote for him?\u201d Harry wondered, allowing himself to be pulled even closer to the other wizard. Shifting to get into a more comfortable position now that he wasn\u2019t sitting upright, Harry ended up simply relaxing his posture and leaning against Tom, not minding at all the man\u2019s arm around his shoulders. \u201dSurely the majority is sensible enough to vote for the better candidate?\u201d\n\u201dThere are people who think that Spencer-Moon is a bit too close to the Muggle Prime Minister,\u201d Tom told him quietly, and abruptly fell silent when a wizard dressed in dark green robes appeared on the stage. His hold on Harry tightened a bit, perhaps unconsciously.\n\u201dThank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your presence here with us today,\u201d the wizard said, wiping the sweat off his forehead. His voice, obviously magically enhanced, carried easily over the crowd. \u201dIn a few moments our two remaining candidates will be right here, in front of all of us, discussing matters that concern them and us. Please keep your spells to yourselves, and keep in mind - vote for the candidate you would be proud to call the British Minister of Magic!\u201d\n\u201dThat\u2019s Augustus Snell. He\u2019s actually a journalist,\u201d Riddle said, his mouth right by Harry\u2019s ear. \u201dA pureblood, and doesn\u2019t look like much, but he\u2019s known to be very critical towards other purebloods.\u201d\n\u201dWhy are you not building a career in politics?\u201d Harry hissed, turning his head towards Riddle and nearly moving back when realizing how close they were. His mouth ghosted over Riddle\u2019s cheek as he continued: \u201dYou clearly know these people. You know their tricks. Why are you in a shovel of a shop in a dark alley instead of there, on that stage, convincing people to vote for you?\u201d\n\u201dPoliticians need quite a bit more than convincing speeches, despite what is claimed by many,\u201d Riddle said, although he didn\u2019t sound as opposed to the idea as he had before. Now both Spencer-Moon and Punnet had taken their seats on the stage, and the debate was just about to start. It was an event very different from what Harry had seen back in his original time. In fact, he hadn\u2019t heard of any debates among candidates.\n\u201dAre you telling me that you wouldn\u2019t be able to succeed at it?\u201d Harry asked, knowing already that that couldn\u2019t be the case. Besides, if Riddle could convince the purebloods to back up his attempt at taking over the wizarding world, why wouldn\u2019t he succeed in convincing them to help him with this? \u201dFind sponsors. Make connections. Be a better minister than Punnet and Spencer-Moon.\u201d \u2019Just don\u2019t become a Dark Lord, for Merlin\u2019s sake.\u2019\n\u201dLook at him flounder,\u201d Riddle muttered, watching Punnet struggle with outlining his plans for the society he was aiming to become a minister of. He gestured widely, spoke at length, and showed off his robes that, according to him, had been handmade in Italy by an army of enslaved Muggles.\n\u201dThe beauty of me, you see, is that I\u2019m very rich,\u201d Punnet said, and Harry\u2019s face twisted in disgusted disbelief. \u201dI can make you, all of you, rich too. I can make our society rich. I can make the Wizarding World of Britain truly great again.\u201d\n\u201dAnd how were you planning on achieving that?\u201d Spencer-Moon asked, clearly unamused and unimpressed. \u201dYou\u2019re yet to share a single goal that you\u2019re capable of achieving, Mr. Punnet.\u201d\n\u201dOf course I can achieve what I promise, I don\u2019t lie,\u201d Punnet instantly said. \u201dLet me tell you, I\u2019m a really intelligent man. I know how to make things great. I know how to make us great again. Some people call me lucky, but I know better. But what I also am - what I am, ladies and gentlemen - is a concerned man. I am a concerned wizard. I\u2019m concerned about you, I\u2019m concerned about me, I\u2019m concerned about all of us. I\u2019m concerned about every muggle-born entering our society. Now \u2013 let me tell you, experts have kept me well informed on these matters. Muggle-born people have quite the advantage in our society\u2014\u201d\n\u201dMr. Punnet, that is not true,\u201d Spencer-Moon interrupted, but sighed heavily in irritation as Punnet continued.\n\u201dI\u2019m not a prejudiced man,\u201d Punnet insisted. \u201dI\u2019m the least prejudiced man you\u2019ll find. What I am is critical. I criticise things. And I know these muggle-born folks. They\u2019re lazy. They have the advantage, their mistakes are forgiven, and they blame their laziness on others. You know why nobody has stopped them? You know why? Because we have too many nice people! That\u2019s right! And you know what I know? I know that people are tired of nice people!\u201d\n\u201dTom,\u201d Harry hissed again, this time horrified. \u201dAre you telling me that this man could become one of the two last candidates, and you wouldn\u2019t be able to do the same? Really?\u201d\nRiddle was silent for a few long moments, before he took a deep sigh, full of what would\u2019ve been resignation had it been done by anyone else. \u201dI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d he finally said. \u201dThe next elections will be in six years. I\u2019ve got time to think about it.\u201d\n*\n\u201dIf I consider your suggestion seriously,\u201d Riddle said, leaning against the counter and watching Harry work. \u201dIt\u2019d mean a significant change in my current... ambitions.\u201d\n\u201dIs that a bad thing?\u201d Harry asked. \u201dThe things you planned on achieving, whatever they are, wouldn\u2019t you be able to achieve them as the minister?\u201d\n\u201dI could, but there are significant obstacles in my way,\u201d said Riddle - well, Tom. Harry really couldn\u2019t help but to refer to him by his given name. \u201dWhile I have managed to acquire quite a few potentially beneficial connections, it\u2019d take quite a bit of manoeuvring to have those connections step into the public eye while professing their support for me.\u201d\n\u201cAre you a muggle-born?\u201d Harry suddenly asked, despite already knowing the answer. \u201dYou never said.\n\u201dNo,\u201d Tom replied. \u201dI\u2019m a half-blood. And while the wizarding family my mother came from is quite... noteworthy, it is not information I was preparing to reveal to the general public. Especially in the beginning - it would escalate things far too fast.\u201d\n\u201dDon\u2019t reveal it, then,\u201d Harry told him, his heart beating fast. This wasn\u2019t the reason he had travelled in the first place, but Merlin... the thought of being able to nudge Riddle - Tom - to a path of less death and destruction was unbelievable. \u201dTell only the people who need to know in order for them to support you. Once you have the situation in your control, only then release the information. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure it out well when the time comes.\u201d\nTom remained silent for a few long moments, watching Harry tending to his flowers. The unusually sunny day made the shop brighter than it tended to be, and with no customers in sight, Harry was free to focus on him.\n\u201dShouldn\u2019t you be working right now?\u201d Harry asked. \u201dYou\u2019ve been here all morning.\u201d\n\u201dBorgin is taking care of it,\u201d Tom replied. \u201dHe won\u2019t need my help until after lunch.\u201d\n\u201dDid he send you to get rid of me again? Is that why he\u2019s not here to take you back?\u201d\n\u201dHmm-m. Perhaps.\u201d\n\u201dHave you read the Daily Prophet?\u201d Harry suddenly said. \u201dYesterday\u2019s, I mean. Punnet is accusing Snell of setting him up.\u201d\n\u201dFor what? Failure?\u201d Tom sneered. \u201dPunnet is doing that all by himself.\u201d\n\u201dHe said that Snell led the discussion in a way that made Punnet appear in a less than favourable light,\u201d Harry said, rolling his eyes. \u201dAs if that fool\u2019s speech didn\u2019t do that already.\u201d\n\u201dPunnet is the kind of a minister who\u2019d allow men like Grindelwald achieve their goals as Dark Lords,\u201d Tom said suddenly, making Harry shift nervously behind the counter. \u201dA man like him being in charge of our society - imagine! How can anyone be blamed for wanting to take over that disaster and steer our society to better avenues?\u201d\n\u201dI don\u2019t think a hostile takeover is the way to go,\u201d Harry argued. \u201dNot when you, for example, would be capable of doing it by gaining the favour of the public without forcing them into submission.\u201d\n\u201dYou know, Harry,\u201d Tom said, giving Harry a dark, assessing look. \u201dSometimes submission is a good thing.\u201d\n\u201dNot when it\u2019s not genuine,\u201d Harry replied. \u201dThen it\u2019s just... another risk you\u2019d be distracted by.\u201d\nTom shook his head and ran his fingers through his hair in a gesture that spoke of impatience. Seeing Tom\u2019s hair this messy and the sleeves of his shirt rolled to his elbows made Harry really\u2014 \u201dI need to plan this,\u201d Tom said, startling Harry out of his thoughts. \u201dI need to plan this carefully, and it\u2019ll be quite the thing to try - I didn\u2019t expect to do this at all - but... perhaps I could. I\u2019ll consider it.\u201d\n\u201dDid you have some other grand plans in the making, then?\u201d Harry asked, wondering if Tom would actually reveal anything to him. No such luck - not that Harry had really expected him to.\n\u201dNone particularly grand,\u201d he replied. \u201dWorking my way up to a management position, perhaps.\u201d\n\u201dAt Borgin and Burkes?\u201d Harry snorted, before shaking his head. \u201dI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure out a way to benefit from that, too, in the future.\u201d\n\u201dEasily,\u201d Tom instantly said. \u201dPeople \u2013 even some old fashioned purebloods who think they worked hard for their inherited money \u2013 enjoy stories of underdogs working their way up from irrelevancy. It gives people the illusion that their environment doesn\u2019t hold them back as much as it really does - after all, if someone can do it, why can\u2019t they? See, I\u2019m not the problem here - there\u2019s nothing about me that people can use to hold me back. What I do need however, is someone knowledgeable about the political circles, not just the public figures.\u201d\n\u201dYou said you were a Slytherin, once,\u201d Harry pointed out. \u201dSurely you know someone who could help you?\u201d\n\u201dOh yes, I know a few,\u201d Tom muttered, and conjured a piece of parchment and a quill out of thin air. Merlin, Harry found even that attractive now. Conjuring things out of thin air, as if he wasn\u2019t able to do the same. \u201dI need to write down a few things. I\u2019ll also need to establish good connections with journalists and acquire some references.\u201d\n\u201dI\u2019m sure you professors from school would help with those?\u201d\n\u201dOh yes, Slughorn definitely will. Perhaps Dippet, although he retired recently.\u201d\n\u201dNot Dumbledore?\u201d Harry asked.\n\u201dNo,\u201d Tom said. \u201dNot Dumbledore.\n*\n\u201dHe\u2019s quite stubborn, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Borgin said one day, slyly looking up from the inventory report he was going through. Riddle didn\u2019t react, perhaps unsure of what the older wizard was talking about. Borgin elaborated: \u201dThat florist neighbour of ours. Rather stubborn, isn\u2019t he? Unlikely to move to Diagon Alley?\u201d\n\u201dHm? Oh yes, quite stubborn indeed,\u201d Riddle agreed. \u201dOblivious and dense as well. Although our initial concerns of him being a ministry spy or an auror were thankfully misplaced, I could... keep convincing him to leave if you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\u201dOh, no, no need,\u201d Borgin sighed, still keeping an eye on every reaction he could spark out of Riddle. \u201dIt\u2019s fine. He stopped with his funerals and doesn\u2019t particularly bother us. You, too, needn\u2019t go there every day. I know you hate having your work disturbed.\u201d\n\u201dI do consider dealing with him a part of my job as well,\u201d Riddle said, his usual narrow-eyed smile fixed on his face. \u201dOne can never tell, really, with people like him.\u201d\n\u201dI think he\u2019s just fine,\u201d Borgin insisted. \u201dI\u2019ve spoken to him a few times, actually. He seems pleasant. He\u2019s certainly hardworking and halfway decent. I was considering introducing my daughter to him. \u201d Not that he had a daughter, but Riddle didn\u2019t know that, now did he?\n\u201dThat... is... quite a leap of faith,\u201d Riddle said. \u201dI\u2019m surprised.\u201d\n\u201dYou don\u2019t consider him a decent wizard?\u201d\n\u201dI don\u2019t think I know him well enough for that, really.\u201d\n\u201dWell, isn\u2019t that something a few good meetings could solve?\u201d Borgin asked. \u2019Circe knows you\u2019ve been meeting him far too often.\u2019 \u201dWho knows, if they get along well enough, he might end up being my son-in-law! Young men his age - and yours too, Tom - are seeking to marry. Better settle down early and have some kids and get your life started.\u201d\n\u201dPerhaps it\u2019d be better to... not count on that,\u201d Riddle replied, the smile on his face void of any amusement. \u201dHe doesn\u2019t seem like the, well, marrying type.\u201d\n\u2019The way that lad\u2019s been looking at you, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised,\u2019 Borgin thought, shaking his head. \u201dWho can tell for sure, really? Might as well give it a shot and see where that goes. Unless, of course... he\u2019s already in a relationship?\u201d\n\u201dHe\u2019s not,\u201d Riddle replied. \u201dSay, people have been recently asking for more goblin-made items. Should I go scouting? It\u2019s unlikely that any will come our way if we just wait.\u201d\n\u201dToo risky,\u201d Borgin dismissed. \u201dWith the new restrictions on trade, it\u2019s too risky to try and look for the kind of items our clients want. How do you know he\u2019s not in a relationship?\u201d\n\u201dI\u2014 what? Oh, you mean the florist?\u201d\n\u201dHarry, yes. That\u2019s his name, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201dBeing in a relationship is not something he has mentioned before,\u201d Riddle said, his nonchalant shrug only halfway convincing. \u201dWe\u2019ve spoken quite a few times, and I\u2019m sure he would\u2019ve mentioned a significant other if he had one.\u201d\n\u201dDepends on the rest of the conversation, now doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Borgin said, before sighing and giving up on the subject. He wasn\u2019t used to doing this, and while he wouldn\u2019t have bothered for someone else, seeing Riddle act a bit more like a human was quite entertaining. \u201dMrs. Shelley sold us a cursed quill a while ago, do you remember where that is? Hicks from two streets down told me to reserve it for him, and paid half in advance.\u201d\n*\n\u201dHarry,\u201d Tom said, stepping into the flower shop. Harry, who had been dangling a wildly cursing zinnia above the rubbish bin - Tom wasn\u2019t going to ask - turned to look at him with a bright smile on his face.\n\u201dHello,\u201d Harry said, and set the zinnia on the counter. The thing clutched its pot with shaking leaves, sobbing loudly. Again, Tom chose to ignore the scene and focus on what was relevant. \u201dYou look, um, not particularly happy today. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nHarry wasn\u2019t incorrect in his assessment. The expression on Tom\u2019s face indicated very clearly that he was upset about something, and the younger wizard couldn\u2019t, for the life of him, guess what it could be. When no explanation was forthcoming, he let Tom sulk in silence for a few moments while preparing some tea. Soon he set down two steaming cups of Earl Grey between them on the counter, and sat down.\nTom looked at him for a few long moments, and sighed heavily.\n\u201dGo on,\u201d Harry urged. \u201dIf you need to talk, just spit it out.\u201d\n\u201dI\u2019m not sure how,\u201d Tom admitted. \u201dI spoke with Borgin earlier today, and he expressed interest in introducing you to his daughter. I\u2019m... I find the thought of that extremely unsettling. I\u2019d rather not have you engaged in any long-term commitments that limit the time you can spend with\u2014 the time you can spend at the store.\u201d\n\u2019Borgin has a daughter?\u2019 Harry thought, before shaking his head. \u201dI wouldn\u2019t be interested in meeting Mr. Borgin\u2019s daughter anyway, so there\u2019s no reason to worry.\u201d Why would he worry, anyway? Unless... perhaps Tom was interested in her?\n\u201dI\u2019m not worried, really,\u201d Tom replied. \u201dWhile I have never met the lady in question, her father is not the sort of a man I would want in my family. You see, he was already speculating whether or not you\u2019d become his son-in-law, and that\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\u201dOh, no, that\u2019s out of question,\u201d Harry replied, not understanding how Borgin could even consider that an option. Or was it common in this time and age? Harry had never spoken to the man, let alone spent enough time in his presence to leave a strong, positive impression. Why on earth would he\u2014 unless... Unless it was a lie meant to irritate Tom somehow? It had obviously succeeded, but how? Why would Tom feel annoyed by the thought of\u2014\nOh.\nWhat if...\nMaybe?\n\u201dIf you don\u2019t know the lady in question, then is what annoys you, perhaps, my part in that scenario?\u201d Harry asked slyly. Tom twitched, and scowled again. He remained silent, and so Harry continued: \u201dWhat if I want to be engaged in a long-term commitment with someone?\u201d\n\u201dThen you should think carefully of your options,\u201d Tom said. Harry laughed, and almost elbowed the possessed zinnia off the counter as he leaned forward, closer to Tom.\n\u201dI think there\u2019s only one option I\u2019m really interested in,\u201d he revealed, feeling far too delighted to be nervous. \u201dI\u2019m not sure if that option wants me, though. All we do is disagree about things\u2014\u201d\n\u201dThat\u2019s not quite true, is it,\u201d Tom hastily interrupted. \u201dYou already know that I\u2019ll be, well.. I\u2019ll be aiming for a career in politics soon enough. Aside from the whole Dark Lord issue, we haven\u2019t disagreed much, have we?\u201d\n\u201dYou\u2019re right,\u201d Harry said agreeably, unable to stop smiling. \u201dAre you going to ask me out for another unofficial date?\u201d\nTom looked at him for a long moment, his eyes wide, and wow - even his eyes were pretty. It was unfair, in Harry\u2019s opinion, because it was really hard to say no to that face - especially knowing the person it belonged to. Tom then coughed, and said: \u201dHow about dinner? Tonight?\u201d\n\u201dI thought you didn\u2019t do dinners,\u201d Harry said, and the other man rolled his eyes, clearly unimpressed.\n\u201dIt didn\u2019t think I did commitment either, but I would mind it with you,\u201d he said. \u201dHow about it? Deal?\u201d\n\u201dAll right,\u201d Harry replied, feeling light and bright and all the things he had thought weren\u2019t for him to feel. He felt happy. \u201dDeal.\u201d\n\u00a0"
