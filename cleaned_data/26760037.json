    "text": "The last place Lan Qiren wanted to be was standing in the noisy, bustling, crowded streets of Yiling, and yet that was exactly where he\u2019d found himself. He had no legitimate reason to be there, avoiding those who stepped too close, trying not to cringe at each shout of the vendors that lined the street, hoping the stench of the place wouldn\u2019t cling onto his robes. Had anyone had the nerve to ask why he was there, not even pretending to browse along the market stalls, he wouldn\u2019t have had a ready answer, least of all one he was willing to share. \nHow could he say that he came here to confront the Yiling Patriarch himself, not for the forbidden cultivation he practiced or war prisoners he protected, but for the damage he had done to Lan Qiren\u2019s own nephew\u2019s heart? \nWangji had been quiet when he came back from his night hunt. Wangji was always quiet, but Lan Qiren was well enough acquainted with his nephew\u2019s tacit emotions to interpret most of his silences. Wangji had returned and spoken of his visit to Yiling in few words as was his nature, but those few words had revealed more than many might have had they been spoken by anyone else. His quiet recount simmered with something that made Lan Qiren hate his late brother for no other reason than that he\u2019d left clueless Lan Qiren to guide his sons through life and love. \nHe\u2019d never quite realized until that moment that he\u2019d never expected Wangji to fall in love. Xichen, yes. Xichen was overflowing with love, finding friends in even the most unlikely of places and lovers just as easily. Xichen was the one he found at sixteen in the library tangled in an intimate embrace with one of the visiting disciples. Xichen was the one who had almost caused an incident with a minor sect by flirting with the Sect Leader\u2019s freshly-betrothed child. Xichen was the one who sometimes had to be summoned back to Cloud Recesses when his stays in Qinghe lingered too long. \nWangji was different. When they had visiting disciples, he hadn\u2019t so much as spared a glance at any of his peers other than to remind them of the rules or to silence any impertinences. Wangji didn\u2019t have the face or temperament to flirt in any circumstances, and he\u2019d never desired anyone enough to pursue them. Foolishly, Lan Qiren thought that meant Wangji would remain unattached like he himself had. \nXichen was the one who Lan Qiren expected to get his heart broken first, but it seemed that he\u2019d gotten all the luck and Wangji all the folly. \nLan Qiren was not so surprised to find that the object of Wangji\u2019s affection was the Yiling Patriarch himself. If his stoic nephew would fall for anyone, it would be that rascal. Perhaps he should have been shocked, but he\u2019d had a bad feeling about Wei Wuxian since the moment he\u2019d recognized his grin as Cangse Sanren\u2019s, especially when he\u2019d caught Wangji on more than one occasion stare at the boy\u2019s back with something akin to longing. \nLan Qiren was displeased over who his nephew had fallen for, but not enough to be unwilling to defend his heart. Since his return from Yiling, Wangji wandered Cloud Recesses in a mood better suited for a lovelorn maiden waiting for her intended to return from war, so Lan Qiren found himself in Yiling against his better judgement, ready for a confrontation. \nHe didn\u2019t know if he actually expected to see Wei Wuxian there, away from the sanctuary of his Burial Mounds, and he didn\u2019t know what he planned to say if he met him, but here he was, loitering, trying not to glare at anyone who was too forceful in trying to ply him with their carved figures and cheap cloth. \nLan Qiren wasn\u2019t quite surprised when he caught sight of Wei Wuxian, mostly because it took him a moment to recognize him. \nThe boy was thin. He was so thin it was jarring, and so pale that he nearly looked like a corpse himself. His eyes were still bright, but rimmed red, aching with something between weary and manic, haunted and haunting. No longer did he walk with that exaggerated swagger that had driven Lan Qiren to madness at Cloud Recesses simply for the fact that his mother had strutted the same arrogant walk. What he did now wasn\u2019t quite a stumble and it wasn\u2019t yet a limp, but it seemed that every step pained him. Or at least, if not pained, then labored. It was like his feet fell on broken shards or his legs weren\u2019t strong enough to support himself. The only thing about him that was unchanged was the smile on his lips. \nThere was something to the slump of his shoulders that aged him, that made Lan Qiren feel like a youth and this young man an elder. \nHad Wangji returned to Cloud Recesses pained because his heart had been broken or because this careless boy was waning? Perhaps his heart had been broken by Wei Wuxian\u2019s pitiful state. Had Lan Qiren been even a touch less callous, his heart might have been broken at the wretched wraith that Wei Wuxian had become. As it was, Lan Qiren couldn\u2019t help the guilty pang of vindication that Wei Wuxian\u2019s dark cultivation was doing to him exactly what he had warned him of back when he was an arrogant student. \nAs Lan Qiren watched, Wei Wuxian ambled down the path, seemingly without purpose. The townspeople ignored him for the most part, and feared him for the somepart. There were those who turned away when his gaze wandered to close, and there were those who sneered behind his back. Between the two were those who seemed to not know who he was, whose eyes slid over him and away without lingering on the flute slung through his belt. \nIt was one of those unawares who stepped a little too close to Wei Wuxian in effort to avoid a murky puddle in the path, a man who didn\u2019t look twice when his shoulder stuck Wei Wuxian\u2019s own. \nLan Qiren\u2019s hand dropped to his sword before the contact was even made, prepared for a vicious backlash from Wei Wuxian towards the man at the slight. He\u2019d seen how unhinged Wei Wuxian had become since the end of the Sunshot Campaign, and he didn\u2019t doubt that this would be met with arrogant outrage. He was completely taken aback, however, when, instead of sending the clueless man sprawling for the mistake, Wei Wuxian himself was cast to the ground. It happened so fast that, for a moment, Lan Qiren thought perhaps Wei Wuxian had simply vanished in some new dark trick, but then he caught sight of dark robes sprawled on the ground, Wei Wuxian braced on his elbows as he stirred dust with the air pushed out of his chest. \nLan Qiren was as stunned as he was confused. The passing man hadn't been a cultivator as far as he could say, and not large by anyone\u2019s standards. He shouldn\u2019t have been able to sway any cultivator\u2019s step, let alone knock one from their feet. \nHad Wei Wuxian\u2019s damned cultivation damaged his spiritual energy?\nLan Qiren was helping Wei Wuxian up off the ground before he\u2019d even realized that he\u2019d moved. \n\u201cAha, don\u2019t mind me,\u201d Wei Wuxian said casually, looking down at his hands as he scrubbed loose gravel from where it had lodged into his palms. \u201cThis one should take care to watch his step.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t look up until Lan Qiren\u2019s hand tightened on his arm. There was a moment where Wei Wuxian seemed not to recognize him before realization colored his pale face, and he jerked back with a look of unobscured terror. \nThat look vexed Lan Qiren as well. What use did the Yiling Patriarch have fearing a cultivator who was more scholar than warrior?\n\u201cAh, Master Lan,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, putting on that grin of his that set off every single one of Lan Qiren\u2019s nerves. \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about this clumsy one. I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d\nHe moved to take a step back, but Lan Qiren just stepped with him. \n\u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you?\u201d\nWei Wuxian was unsubtle about the way he tried to pull his arm from Lan Qiren\u2019s grip, but he didn\u2019t give it half the effort a man wanting for escape would, so Lan Qiren held fast.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you see? Someone very inconsiderate knocked me over. He didn\u2019t even stop to see if I was okay.\u201d\n\u201cA non-cultivator,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen cultivators with a stronger core than most fail to knock you off your feet. How is it that this man was able to do so simply by stepping into your path?\u201d\nWei Wuxian set his jaw in defiance, eyes flashing. \n\u201cHe caught me unaware.\u201d\nLan Qiren wasn\u2019t one for games, and he\u2019d had enough of letting Wei Wuxian try to squirm his way out of admitting to his faults.\n\u201cI warned you that dark energy was dangerous, harmful to the mind, body, and spirit. I warned you when you were a student at Cloud Recesses, and yet here you are. I always knew you were arrogant, but this is new heights. Corrupting your core to keep this dark power is too far even for you.\u201d \nHe regretted the words as soon as they were out of his mouth, but it seemed his regret wasn\u2019t enough to keep Wei Wuxian from flinching back like he\u2019d been struck. It was astounding how young he looked now that Lan Qiren had knocked the cocky grin off his lips. Astounding and heartbreaking almost, in a distant way as Wei Wuxian blinked to dispel the tears that gathered on his lashes, too weak to pull his wrist from Lan Qiren\u2019s grasp.\nHe seemed stunned beyond words which normally would thrill Lan Qiren, but at the moment made him feel an uncomfortable pulling in his chest that felt a little too much like compassion for his liking. \n\u201cIt\u2019s my core, I can do with it what I will.\u201d\nHis voice wavered, and Lan Qiren grew more agitated. \n\u201cWei Wuxian, how could you be so flippant? Cultivating a golden core is a privilege. One that shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly.\u201d\nAs he spoke, Lan Qiren adjusted his grip to Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist so that he could examine the damage that had been done to his core. If betting were not forbidden, he might wager that he would find Wei Wuxian\u2019s core swimming with the corrupted energy that he cultivated with, tarnishing the gold into something reproachful.\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Wei Wuxian tried to protest, but Lan Qiren\u2019s grip still held against the way he tried to squirm his way out of the tight cage of his fingers. \nHe didn\u2019t try to reach for his flute whether because Lan Qiren held his arm or because he didn\u2019t have any corpses close enough to help. \nWhen Wei Wuxian had been his student, Lan Qiren had been impressed with his core, however much it irked him to find good in the boy. At such a young age, he had been very advanced, enough to rival even Lan Qiren\u2019s own nephews who were diligent and powerful. His spiritual energy should have been strong and pulsing throughout his whole body, straining against the confines of his skin, bright with power. Even with a suppressed or corrupted core, Lan Qiren should have felt something at the surface, even just a faint whisper. \nInstead, there was nothing. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d He breathed, though he hadn\u2019t meant to speak. \nWei Wuxian shook his head again, a smile stretching over his face, brittle and strained. Did he really think he could fool Lan Qiren with the way his eyes were now swimming with tears?\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he whispered with another weak tug to free his wrist. \nLan Qiren was too distracted by the gaping absence under his fingertips to pay that much mind. He probed deeper, pressing hard enough to bruise, and yet still, there was nothing. He was still in enough control over himself not to slam his hand over where Wei Wuxian\u2019s lower meridian lay, but only barely. \n\u201cWhen?\u201d He started. \u201cHow did\u2014\u201d\nLeaving one\u2019s sentences unfinished wasn\u2019t against the rules, but it was rude. Lan Qiren didn\u2019t have it in him to care in the face of this earth-shattering revelation. How long had this boy\u2019s core been gone? By Wangji\u2019s report, Wen Zhuliu had died at the end of the three months Wei Wuxian had been missing. He remembered the pitiful state that Wen Chao had been left in and he wondered if it wasn\u2019t revenge for his core. \nWei Wuxian opened his mouth to protest again, but it seemed that he was out of energy, drained by his dark magic or seeing someone he hadn\u2019t expected to see or perhaps some other reason that lay on his mountain of corpses. His knees gave out from underneath him, and he would have collapsed back into the dirt had Lan Qiren not caught him. \nWei Wuxian was startlingly light as Lan Qiren supported him by the elbows. He ushered them away from the crowd, over to the corner of a building that was mostly unoccupied. \nAs much as he wanted to hate Wei Wuxian, as much as he\u2019d hated him in the past, all he could see in that moment was his own nephews. If they were in such a pitiful state that they swayed on their own feet and were so thin their bones looked like they could cut through their own skin, how could he stand by and let them suffer, regardless of whatever evils they seemed to have brought upon the world?\nWei Wuxian, like the rest of them, had been through a war, and though Lan Qiren had fought, who had fought more than Wei Wuxian? Though Lan Qiren had lost much, who had lost more than Wei Wuxian? Though Lan Qiren was still haunted by those evils, who could claim to be more haunted than Wei Wuxian? \nHe was yet so young. \nLan Qiren made a decision then, one that might not have been his to make, but he couldn\u2019t stand for this to go on. Besides, if nothing else, perhaps it would make his nephew happy. \n\u201cHow could I, as your elder and former teacher, leave you in such a state. You need help and I can provide it. I will place you under my protection in Cloud Recesses until we work out a solution.\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s laugh was bitter as he stumbled back, finally able to put distance between them now that Lan Qiren no longer held his wrist in a death grip.\n\u201cDid Lan Zhan send you?\u201d he asked, voice brittle and sharp now that he was truly confronted. \u201cHe\u2019s already commanded me to go with him to Cloud Recesses for punishment. What makes you think I\u2019d go with you if I already refused him?\u201d\nIf it wasn\u2019t against his very nature, Lan Qiren might have rolled his eyes. If this continued, he might just do so. \n\u201cI am more than certain that my nephew holds no desire to see you punished. He wants to help you. He had made it very clear that he would do almost anything to protect you if you would allow him.\u201d\nWangji hadn\u2019t said as much out loud, but it was obvious. Lan Qiren had caught sight of Wangji moving extra blankets into his Jingshi, and Xichen said that he\u2019d request spare robes in grey and blue rather than his usual white. He hadn\u2019t gone as far as to ask for an extra bed, but Lan Qiren had seen him eyeing their storeroom, likely so that he would be able to find a bed as quickly as needed. It was easy to see that Wangji was preparing for a guest, however impossible it was for him to keep, and it softened Lan Qiren\u2019s heart as much as it hardened it. His nephew had never been so intent on something like this and it would be amusing if it hadn\u2019t been for the Yiling Patriarch. \nLan Qiren\u2019s words brought Wei Wuxian to pause. He cocked his head at Lan Qiren, eyes distant like he was running over conversations in his head, reliving Wangji\u2019s words.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say.\u201d\nLan Qiren had alway thought that of the two, Wangji was the most oblivious to people\u2019s intentions, but it seemed that Wei Wuxian had him beat on this. \n\u201cHe probably did, but I doubt you were listening.\u201d\nWei Wuxian let out an indignant squawk that was so loud and sudden that it nearly startled Lan Qiren. \n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I listen to every word Lan Zhan says,\u201d he exclaimed, crossing his arms over his chest.\nLan Qiren leveled him with a look. That look had made many a student cower over the years but not Wei Wuxian. In fact, it earned him a dark look in return. \nLan Qiren spoke before Wei Wuxian could open his mouth again. \n\u201cMy nephew speaks with much more than just words.\u201d\nWei Wuxian scrunched his face as he turned Lan Qiren\u2019s words over in his head before he sighed. \n\u201cEven if I believed you, and I\u2019m not saying I do, I can\u2019t go,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Wen need my protection.They need me.\u201d\nLan Qiren had heard so much of these Wen prisoners that he was sick of it. \n\u201cWhat use are you to errant cultivators without no core in your chest? Let them fight their own battles.\u201d\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t cultivators, though.\u201d\nThis boy\u2019s disrespect wasn\u2019t amusing when he was Lan Qiren\u2019s student and it seemed his impertinence had only gotten worse as he\u2019d grown older. \n\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of your lies,\u201d he spat. \u201cI\u2019ve read the reports from Jin Guangshan himself. We know that you harbor fugitive Wen cultivators who aided him in his fight against us.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, they aren\u2019t cultivators. Just a handful of sick, tired, old people and a doctor. No one there is a threat to anyone.\u201d\nAs much as Lan Qiren didn\u2019t want to walk into the Burial Mounds, it was probably better than standing in the street with everyone yelling about something. Besides, what better way than to catch Wei Wuxian in a lie. \n\u201cTake me, then. I\u2019ll see for myself.\u201d \nHe almost expected Wei Wuxian to refuse, but he simply straightened his shoulders and gestured for Lan Qiren to follow him. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to trust you not to hurt anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you try anything, I will not hesitate to protect them. Hopefully Lan Zhan could forgive me for that much.\u201d\nWei Wuxian insisted on walking himself back up the path through the gnarled trees, though Lan Qiren kept an eye out lest he falter again. Wangji would likely never forgive him if he let Wei Wuxian be injured. \nLan Qiren was surprised to find that the settlement, if the barren landscape littered with makeshift lodging and pitiful little tools and tables could be called that, occupied mainly by elderly folk. They appeared, whether by a true telling of their age or illness and malnourishment, to be older than he was, some old enough to be his parents. Lan Qiren knew what farmers looked like and he knew what warriors looked like. These appeared to be neither. How could they wield a sword with their hands curled and spotted by the sun? How could they till the ground with their shoulders frail and hunched with age? \n\u201cAnd where have you hidden your cultivators?\u201d He demanded, turning to face Wei Wuxian. \u201cThis cannot be all.\u201d\nWei Wuxian gestured broadly. \n\u201cGo ahead and look. The only cultivators here you\u2019ll find are you and me.\u201d\nLan Qiren wanted to call him on a bluff, but how could they have known that he was coming to prepare? Lan Qiren had been with Wei Wuxian the whole time and, unless he\u2019d invented some new trick that was unable to be seen by the eye, he hadn\u2019t sent a message ahead. Besides, there was nowhere to hide someone unless they were huddled in the trees. \nLan Qiren\u2019s hand tightened into a fist where it rested behind his back. He didn\u2019t appreciate being lied to, especially by a Sect Leader like Jin Guangshan, and he would be speaking with him. He was sure that the other Sect Leaders, particularly Sect Leader Nie, would be very interested in knowing that they\u2019d been told a lie. He burned with something between anger at being misled and shame at thinking the Jin Sect righteous in their condemnation of these people. \nLuckily, he was spared from having to speak through the tightness in his chest when a small figure barreled into Wei Wuixan\u2019s legs, nearly knocking him off balance. Lan Qiren\u2019s eyes nearly fell from his head when he realized that the figure tugging on the skirts of Wei Wuxian\u2019s robes with grubby hands was a child. A child had certainly not been in Jin Guangshan\u2019s account.\n\u201cXian-gege,\u201d the boy said, bouncing in excitement where he stood, still gripping onto Wei Wuixan\u2019s robes. \u201cToys?\u201d \nWei Wuxian answered with a laugh as he ruffled the boy\u2019s hair. \n\u201cA-Yuan,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cHow rude you\u2019ve become! I\u2019ll have to tell Rich-gege not to come back if this is what it does to you.\u201d\nThe boy\u2019s eyes grew wide at his words, and his lip stuck out, wobbling with a ferocity that Lan Qiren recognized as the beginning of a meltdown. He wondered if the boy\u2019s mother would perhaps collect him before he could disturb them any farther. Wei Wuxian seemed to not share his concerns, laughing again and catching the boy\u2019s jutted lip between his fingers. \n\u201cNone of that. I\u2019m kidding of course,\u201d he said. \u201cNow straighten up. We have to be on our best behavior in front of our guest.\u201d\nThe boy dropped his pout and batted Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand away from his lip before his eyes darted on Lan Qiren. Realizing he was being watched, the little boy ducked behind Wei Wuxian out of view, peeking around his leg to stare up at Lan Qiren. His behavior was very undisciplined, but Lan Qiren felt it could be excused on account of his living situation and Wei Wuxian\u2019s influence. \n\u201cThis is Rich-gege\u2019s Uncle,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, steering the child by his shoulders out from behind him and in front of Lan Qiren. \u201cGreet him properly. I know you know how.\u201d\nThe boy turned wide eyes over to him, calculating for a second. Lan Qiren waited for a bow. One of his favorite things was passing the youngest disciples and being greeted with their clumsy little bows. It was very adorable, though he wouldn\u2019t admit to anyone that he found it cute. He had a reputation. \nA-Yuan, however, didn\u2019t bow. \n\u201cToys?\u201d He asked with an expectant smile, stunning Lan Qiren into remaining silent.\n\u201cA-Yuan!\u201d Wei Wuxian barked.\nHe looked to Lan Qiren and explained, \u201cLan Zhan bought him a few toys when he visited and now A-Yuan thinks he\u2019s owed something when I come back from town.\u201d To the boy, he crouched down, pulled an errant finger from his mouth, and said, \u201cA-Yuan, it\u2019s very rude to ask if someone brought you a toy, especially if that someone is a stranger.\u201d \nThe child nodded seriously before turning back to Lan Qiren. \nNo one had said anything about there being a child among the numbers of the Wen Remnants. Lan Qiren would almost believe that the child was Wei Wuxian\u2019s own son if it hadn\u2019t been that his nephew hadn\u2019t been quite that dejected when he\u2019d returned to Cloud Recesses. He was probably a Wen, and, judging by the ages of the folk around, an orphaned one at that, unless he was Maiden Wen\u2019s child, but that struck him as unlikely judging by the boy\u2019s age. \nLan Qiren expected a polite apology or perhaps a greeting, but what he got instead was an expectant hand extended and another question. \u201cCandy?\u201d\nWei Wuxian let out an exasperated noise. \n\u201cA-Yuan, come here,\u201d he said, tugging Wen Yuan back over to himself. \nLan Qiren wasn\u2019t surprised that instead of scolding Wen Yuan, Wei Wuxian simply rolled his eyes and pulled a small wrapped package from the breast of his robe, unwrapping it to reveal several pieces of candy. A child was spoiled like that, but Lan Qiren could remember instances of spoiling his own nephews from time to time, so he couldn\u2019t say anything without being hypocritical. \n\u201cI shouldn't even give this to you,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, holding the parcel out to Wen Yuan. \u201cYou\u2019re being too rude.\u201d\nWen Yuan\u2019s eyes grew rounder in desperation as he reached out, jumping when Wei Wuxian held the treat out of his reach. Lan Qiren thought about interrupting them, but he didn\u2019t want to have to deal with a child plus Wei Wuxian. \n\u201cHow about we save it until we eat supper,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. \u201cThen we can share with everyone.\u201d\nThe boy jumped once more before settling and nodding. Wei Wuxian handed him the package and the boy held it tightly in his hands like he was scared to let it go. Most children wouldn\u2019t have so much self-restraint when handed a package full of sweets, even in the face of a promise to eat it later, but, however undisciplined this little Wen was, he seemed to be willing to wait and share. \n\u201cSorry,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, standing back up with the child\u2019s hand clasped in his. \u201cHe\u2019s always excited when I come back from town, I should have prepared you.\u201d\nThis boy had a finger back in his mouth, and Lan Qiren couldn\u2019t help but think of Wangji at that age who had sucked his thumb, much to Lan Qiren\u2019s exasperation. He hadn\u2019t dropped the habit until he\u2019d been old enough to start his lessons. Even then, Lan Qiren had known he still hadn\u2019t stopped, he just got better at hiding it. Lan Qiren had caught him sometimes at night, when he came to check on his nephews before he went to bed. He'd asked Xichen\u2019s help in trying to break Wangji of his habit, but Xichen was soft. He\u2019d been especially weak to chubby-cheeked, serious little A-Zhan who meticulously washed his hands so no one could tell him that putting his thumb in his mouth was unsanitary.\nIt was then that a young woman approached whom Lan Qiren recognized as the Young Maiden Wen. So far, she seemed to be the only person who had actually been accounted for correctly in Jin Guangshan\u2019s report. \n\u201cGrandmaster Lan,\u201d she said with a low, venerable bow. \nIf she hadn\u2019t been wearing the red of the Wen Sect. Lan Qiren might suggest that Wei Wuxian take his manners from her. Or at the very least, that she be in charge of teaching Wen Yuan manners instead of Wei Wuxian. \n\u201cLike I said, we do have a doctor,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, lifting the child onto his hip in an easy practiced motion. \u201cThis is Wen Qing.\u201d\n\u201cI would offer you tea,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t have anything that extravagant.\u201d\nNever in his life had Lan Qiren considered tea to be extravagant. It was simply a staple of daily life like water and an evening meal. Though, looking around, both of those things might be considered extravagant here as well. \nThere was something sharp to Wen Qing\u2019s expression, and Lan Qiren could see tension in her shoulders and her clenched fist. He wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she had a weapon hidden in the folds of her robes, ready to protect her people from him if needs be. He wondered if Wangji was treated with such suspicion or if the devotion he carried for Wei Wuxian in his heart and written in his eyes was enough to convince them that he was no harm. \n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford anything like that,\u201d Wei Wuxian said with a laugh that probably wasn\u2019t meant to sound as bitter as it had. \u201cWe\u2019re dirt poor, don\u2019t you know.\u201d \nWen Yuan parroted, \u201cDirt poor!\u201d \nThe Wen standing around regarded Lan Qiren with wary eyes, though they didn\u2019t move any closer. There weren\u2019t as many as he expected, and for a moment he considered that perhaps Wei Wuxian had hidden some cultivators from him to jump out when the opportunity struck. \n\u201cHow many are there here?\u201d He asked.\nWei Wuxian glanced around at the settlement, brushing his nose with a finger as Wen Yuan copied his motion, still clutching his little parcel of candy to his chest. \n\u201cCounting me, thirty-six,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThirty six,\u201d Wen Yuan said with a nod, earning him a hair ruffle from Wei Wuxian. \nLan Qiren had heard reports of there being more than fifty people who escaped from the Jin labor camp. He wondered if that had been another lie to make the Wen remnants seem more dangerous or if some had passed between their liberation and now. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising. The journey here from Qiongqi was harsh, and settling the Burial Mounds would have certainly taken a toll. It would have been more of a marvel if all had survived, it was a marvel that any of them had. \n\u201cPerhaps we should talk. If what you\u2019ve said is true, that there are no other cultivators, I may be willing to offer my protection for all of you in Gusu.\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s eyes grew wide as well as Wen Qing\u2019s as they made eye contact, both surprised, both suspicious. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s Gusu?\u201d Wen Yuan asked. \n\u201cThat\u2019s Rich-gege\u2019s home,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, breaking his silent communication with Wen Qing. \nShe instead turned her gaze to Lan Qiren, still suspicious as they tried to determine if he was really offering what he\u2019d said. Lan Qiren was insulted that they would think he would lie, but he also understood their caution. \n\u201cAre there toys there?\u201d Wen Yuan asked Wei Wuxian. \nA laugh as Lan Qiren and Wen Qing continued their staring match. Lan Qiren looked away first, not because he was intimidated but because he was uncomfortable under her scrutiny. \n\u201cOf course, you silly radish,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, poking Wen Yuan's little round nose. \nLan Qiren couldn\u2019t help but think that Wen Yuan looked a little like Wangji had at that age, though he smiled much more. It made his chest hurt a little to think about how little Wangji had smiled as a child so he pushed such thoughts to the back of his mind. \n\u201cWe can go,\u201d Wen Yuan said with a nod. \u201cBut only if granny comes too.\u201d\nWei Wuxian looked around the settlement before his eyes landed back on Lan Qiren. \n\u201cWe have to talk about it first.\u201d\nThey talked long into the night. \nBefore they began negotiations, Wei Wuxian gave Lan Qiren a long look before he said, \u201cThere is one more thing you should know before you make any real offers.\u201d\nIt was then that a figure stepped out from the shadows, head bowed respectfully, showing the creeping dark mark up its neck to mark it as a corpse. Lan Qiren couldn\u2019t help the way his hand readied to draw his sword. \n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d He hissed, darting his eyes to Wei Wuxian. \nBut Wei Wuxian wasn\u2019t looking at Lan Qiren, he was instead, moving to stand between him and the corpse, his eyes sending a sharp look to Wen Qing, keeping her from stepping forward Lan Qiren realized. \n\u201cThis is Wen Ning,\u201d he said. \u201cI need you to let me explain before you do anything.\u201d\nThe corpse\u2019s head was still bowed respectfully, and Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t played his flute, but Lan Qiren still wasn\u2019t sure this wasn\u2019t a trap.\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t like other corpses. He is fully conscious and has no desire to hurt anyone,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. \u201cHe\u2019s like this because he was abused under the hands of the Jin keeping him in the camp, beaten and used as bait until they left him in a pit with a summoning flag pierced through his chest. I decided to bring him back to give him another chance, so if anyone is at fault, it\u2019s me and not him. \nThe corpse gave a stiff, formal bow and then looked to Wei Wuxian to know what to do next. \n\u201cWe will refuse your offer unless it includes Wen Ning,\u201d Wei Wuxian said finally. \nLan Qiren didn\u2019t pace even though it might have benefitted him in releasing the sudden tension in his body. He did turn and stalk from the cave so that he could think away from the press of the rest of them. \nHe\u2019d heard about the corpses Wei Wuxian had used to free the Wen prisoners from captivity, but he hadn\u2019t known that he\u2019d still kept them and paraded them about like \nBut could he stand by and let these people starve to death on the Burial Mounds\u2019 cursed ground? If he hadn\u2019t seen the rest of the Wen remnants, he would have. Lan Qiren wasn\u2019t sure if his mind was made up more out of compassion or spite at being lied to by Jin Guangshan, but he decided to give Wei Wuxian the benefit of the doubt. \nHe rejoined the rest of them, keeping a wary eye on the corpse who sat in the corner and entertained Wen Yuan while they spoke. His mind kept drifting to them both because he wanted to make sure the corpse wasn\u2019t going to hurt the boy and because it was a curious sight. \nLan Qiren wondered if hunger wasn\u2019t a driving force of the way most of them seemed open to his offer. Or perhaps it was comfort, or to not be afraid anymore. For Lan Qiren, it would have been the proximity of corpses, but seeing as they\u2019d come here with the grandmaster of Demonic cultivation himself, they probably weren\u2019t as put off by that sort of thing as Lan Qiren was. \nHalfway through the night, with most of the elders latching onto the idea of Wei Wuxian accepting Lan Qiren\u2019s offer and Wei Wuxian still not quite believing that was their best choice, Lan Qiren was asked to leave so that they could have a private discussion. Lan Qiren was too glad for a break in tense conversation with mostly strangers that he was neither offended nor suspicious. He had a long moment to himself, trying to meditate, but succeeding only in forming arguments to make to the elders istead. He was halfway through formulating exactly where he would suggest building a settlement when he was interrupted by someone approaching. \nWen Qing had never looked intimidating to him before, but, being a teacher, he didn\u2019t find many young people intimidated. He knew youth too well. Even Sect Leader Nie himself, though he was long from youth, had never intimidated Lan Qiren. Perhaps it was foolish of him, but it was a folly that he wasn\u2019t quick to give up. Now though, Wen Qing looked like she could rattle the leaves from every tree in the forest, had the trees in the Burial Mounds had something so vivacious as leaves. He knew that she wasn\u2019t a great cultivator, but he also assumed that, if she felt the need, she would find a way to hurt him, maybe even kill him. Most women were like that, and Lan Qiren couldn\u2019t help but be both impressed at their mettle and glad he\u2019d never married.\n\u201cMost of them just want Wei Wuxian to not have to run himself into the ground trying to keep us safe anymore,\u201d she said, setting down a plate next to him with a more generous portion than Lan Qiren had seen on anyone else\u2019s plate. \u201cHe\u2019s more than willing to die for us, and that scares them. They don\u2019t want him to have to sacrifice any more than he already has for us. Bearing that kind of debt isn\u2019t easy.\u201d \nShe didn\u2019t sit and it made Lan Qiren feel like he should stand, but he found he didn\u2019t want to. She didn\u2019t mention it so he assumed she didn\u2019t mind.\n\u201cThey\u2019re old.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound melancholy, just resigned. \u201cAll they want is to make sure that my brother, A-Yuan and I live well and that Wei Wuxian can stop ruining himself for them. They want us to be safe and happy, and then they want a peaceful place to live and die. Could Cloud Recesses be that place or would we still struggle for peace there as well?\u201d\n\u201cI think so,\u201d he responded.\nHe picked up the plate and began to eat even though he wasn\u2019t hungry because he felt it would be rude to decline this offer of hospitality. \n\u201cUnless you can guarantee that it won\u2019t be worse there than we have it here, I will go in there and tell everyone to ignore you, and they\u2019ll listen to me,\u201d Wen Qing said. \n\u201cI can\u2019t promise much, but I promise that you\u2019ll have my protection and I\u2019m sure that of my nephew as well. The elders will be unhappy, but I have enough sway with them that they won\u2019t dismiss me or you. You will have shelter in Gusu and a home. Probably not in Cloud Recesses itself, but down the mountain, near the town. It wouldn\u2019t be a bad life.\u201d\nShe nodded. There was a serious look in her eye as she turned his words over in her head. \n\u201cYou have sway with your Elders, I have sway with mine,\u201d she said, turning to enter the cave once again. \u201cThis will be a relief to them.\u201d She paused and then said, \u201cWei Wuxian will be the hardest to convince, but if everyone else agrees, he\u2019ll allow it.\u201d \nIt was several hours after then that Wei Wuxian emerged from the cave and approached Lan Qiren. His eyes were dark and there was a resigned slump to his shoulders. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll go with you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re serious about offering protection, we\u2019ll go.\u201d\nLan Qiren didn\u2019t quite know what to say so he simply nodded. \n\u201cWe can be prepared to leave in the morning unless that would be too early. \n\u201cThe sooner the better,\u201d Lan Qiren replied. \nNot only because he was eager to leave the Burial Mounds, but because he feared what any more time in this corpse-ridden air would do to the people there. \nIt didn't take long for them to pack, likely because there were so few possessions between them. They left the border of the Burial Mounds before the sun reached it\u2019s midpoint in the sky, and Lan Qiren couldn\u2019t help but breathe deeply the fresh air once they\u2019d passed the last crooked, sickly tree.\nThe journey back to Cloud Recesses was long and annoying. They went on foot seeing as Lan Qiren was the only one who could fly. Most of the Wen were elderly and therefore weren\u2019t as able, so there were frequent stops and the pace was agonizingly slow. Lan Qiren tried his best not to become too irritated, even when Wen Yuan left little dirty fingerprints all over the skirt of his outer robe and Wei Wuxian chatted incessantly. He found an unexpected kinship with Wen Qing who sighed every time Lan Qiren felt the urge and rolled her eyes each time Lan Qiren refrained from doing so himself. \n\u201cMy nephew knows about your core,\u201d Lan Qiren said to Wei Wuxian as they walked side by side. \nIt wasn\u2019t a question. Wangji must know based on how fiercely protective he wanted to protect Wei Wuxian. \nLan qiren caught Wen Qing\u2019\u2019s head snap in their direction out of the corner of his eye, and assumed that meant she knew of his core as well. \n\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nIt was Lan Qiren\u2019s turn to be shocked. \n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\nWei Wuxian let out a bitter laugh that sounded all the more bitter coming from him of all people. \n\u201cIf Lan Zhan knew I didn\u2019t have a core, he\u2019d have probably thrown me over his shoulder and flown me to Cloud Recesses kicking and screaming already. \nLan Qiren turned to look at Wei Wuxian, the tired slump of his shoulder, the signs of hunger that still clung to his gaunt cheeks, the way he guarded the Wen with wary eyes still, even though Lan Qiren had given npr reason for him to distrust him. \n\u201cIf I know nothing else about my nephew, I know that he would never even consider keeping you or anyone else in Cloud Recesses prisoner.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nHe hesitated. \n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Wangji that. It\u2019s not my story to tell.\u201d\nIt still made his chest hurt to think of his brother. They hadn\u2019t been close since they\u2019d been young, since before his brother had met the woman who would be his wife. Lan Qiren could remember the exact moment where he and his brother began to drift. It was the night he tried to stop his brother from marrying.\nThere was much Lan Qiren regretted, but not being able to stop his brother from marrying her and locking her away was one of his biggest regrets.\nHe shook his head to rid himself of thoughts of his late brother and changed the subject.\n\u201cWhen did Wen Zhuliu take your core?\u201d He asked. \nLan Qiren only realized that the question was too personal once he\u2019d already asked it, but Wei Wuxian answered before he could take it back. \n\u201cLike I would have given Wen Chao\u2019s dog the opportunity to lay a single finger on me,\u201d Wei Wuxian growled with all the venom of the Yiling Patriarch. \n\u201cThen how?\u201d\nWei Wuxian paused for long enough that Lan Qiren thought he wouldn't answer. He fiddled with his flute in his belt and looked out into the distance as Lan Qiren waited. He wasn\u2019t really expecting an answer, so he was surprised when he took a deep breath and spoke. \n\u201cI gave it away,\u201d he said, and then continued despite Lan Qiren\u2019s sharp gasp. \u201cI offered it in exchange for my brother\u2019s life.\u201d\nDuring the war probably, but if not Wen Zhuliu, then what had happened. Who could broker such an exchange? \n\u201cTo whom?\u201d\nWei Wuxian refused to look over, keeping his gaze trained on the horizon. \n\u201cThe gods? Fate? My brother himself?\u201d He asked each name with increasing spite. \u201cWhat does it matter? It's gone and that\u2019s that.\u201d\nLan Qiren felt uneasy about asking after such a personal and serious hurt in the first place, so he was quick to let the subject drop. \n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\nThey both fell silent then, distracted by little Wen Yuan running up and showing them a handful of weeds he\u2019d picked from the side of the road. \n\u201cWhat kind of radishes are these?\u201d He asked. \n\u201cThose aren\u2019t radishes, silly\u201d Wei Wuxian said with a laugh, hauling Wen Yuan up onto his hip. \u201cThey\u2019re flowers.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re flowers,\u201d the boy repeated with a nod before he turned back to holler over Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders. \u201cLook, Qing-jie! Flowers!\u201d\nLan Qiren turned his face away from Wei Wuxian so he wouldn\u2019t be able to see his smile.\nWangji was gone on another night hunt when they returned. No doubt Xichen had sent him to get his mind off his forlorn moping. Wei Wuxian pouted when Xichen told them, and Lan Qiren wanted to scold him for his posture at the way he slumped. \n\u201cI\u2019ll send for him. Tell him what\u2019s happened.\u201d\nLan Qiren shook his head.\n\u201cYou said he\u2019s set to return tomorrow? I\u2019ll tell him when he returns. Right now we need to talk with the Elders.\u201d \nThe Elders trusted his judgement about bringing Wei Wuxian and the Wen Remnants to Cloud Recesses. They had been more reluctant before Lan Qiren had revealed that they had been deceived by Jin Guangshan regarding the threat the occupants of the Burial Mounds posed. Their decision may have been rushed by the fact that they were anxious to get the ragged, elderly Wen loitering at the gates out of the public eye. Of course there were conditions, but they were accepted readily. \nThe first was that the Stygian Tiger Seal was to be handed over to Lan Qiren. Wei Wuxian had hesitated at first before taking into consideration his Wen Remnants. He seemed to consider the giving away of his seal payment for their protection. Lan Qiren hadn\u2019t revealed Wei Wuxian\u2019s missing golden core, but he had implied that the boy\u2019s spiritual energy was damaged which further helped to assuage the Elders\u2019 fears, especially once his seal and flute were out of his hands. Wei Wuxian seemed nervous to let them go, and before he released them completely, he looked Lan Qiren deep in the eye, expression sharp and serious. \n\u201cIf I find that this is a trick,\u201d he said with all the seriousness Lan Qiren had ever heard from him. \u201cI will not show mercy to the Lan Sect, not even for Lan Zhan\u2019s sake. You will all burn, and I will feel no remorse.\u201d\nLan Qiren would never lead such a trick, but he didn\u2019t begrudge Wei Wuxian this lingering threat. He was putting himself and his people into unfamiliar hands.\n\u201cMeet me in the library tomorrow after midday,\u201d Lan Qiren said as Xichen led the Wen remnants to where they would be staying until they figured out what to do with them. \nWei Wuxian stopped walking and looked to Lan Qiren with a wary expression. \n\u201cWhat for?\u201d He asked before narrowing his eyes. \u201cPunishment?\u201d\nLan Qiren held in his exasperated sigh. He was tired and ready to clean the dust of the road off of him and go to bed, and he didn\u2019t need Wei Wuxian keeping him up any later with annoying assumptions of library punishments. \n\u201cSo we can start looking for a way to fix your core,\u201d he explained. He\u2019d thought that much was pretty obvious. Didn\u2019t Wei Wuxian know that he was brought here not just to help the Wen but to help himself. Lan Qiren was sure he\u2019d made that clear in the marketplace when he\u2019d first discovered Wei Wuxian\u2019s missing core, but perhaps he hadn\u2019t. \nWei Wuxian just blinked at him in shock, like he wasn\u2019t quite comprehending Lan Qiren\u2019s words, so Lan Qiren continued, brushing longing thoughts of a warm bath out of his mind for the time being. \n\u201cWhen a core is melted, it damages the spiritual pathways. You said that yours was given away, so perhaps there\u2019s a way to build it back,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou\u2019re too old to form a core the traditional way, but I have a few ideas.\u201d \nWei Wuxian was still blinking at him, slack-jawed and astonished, but Lan Qiren had long since realized that he should never expect anything like propriety from him. \n\u201cReally?\u201d Wei Wuxian asked once he\u2019d shook himself from his shock. \u201cYou really think I could get it back?\u201d\nXichen and the rest of the Wes were out of sight by now, and the sun was beginning to set. Lan Qiren savored the renewed quiet as Wei Wuxian waited on his answer. \n\u201cI make no promises, but what can it hurt to try?\u201d\nFor a moment, it looked like Wei Wuxian might cry, so Lan Qiren made his excuses to retire for the evening.\nThe next morning they took to the library to gather texts at Lan Qiren\u2019s direction before he led Wei Wuxian to the private garden he kept behind his home. He wouldn\u2019t admit it to anyone, but Wei Wuxian looked like he could use sunlight. Actually, he looked like he could use rest and food and perhaps a healer, but this was what Lan Qiren could provide, so he gave it willingly. \n\u201cHow are your Wen settling in?\u201d He asked, not because he really wanted to make small talk but because he was genuinely curious. \n\u201cI told them to rest today while the elders agree on where to let them stay,\u201d he glanced up. \u201cI hope that\u2019s okay?\u201d\nWei Wuxian needed rest as well, but Lan Qiren figured that he would deny it if he brought it up. Besides, who was he to coddle him? He certainly wasn\u2019t a child, and, malnourished and tired as he was, he was responsible for himself.\nThe first step was to research everything they could about cores. Lan Qiren had already read all of the texts he\u2019d gathered, but never with the eye of someone trying to restore a core. It wouldn\u2019t hurt. Besides, there were fresh eyes with him. He\u2019d pried only once more into what had happened to Wei Wuxian\u2019s core, but he just claimed that he\u2019d given it away and that was all Lan Qiren needed to know. \nThey kept at their work for what seemed like ages\nBack when Wangji\u2019s generation of students were studying at Cloud Recesses, Lan Qiren had once observed Wei Wuxian in the library under his punishment. Wangji had sat with perfect posture, silently reading or copying, whatever his task called for, while Wei Wuxian fidgeted and doodled and made errant noises meant to distract Wangji. Lan Qiren was more than proud of his nephew for keeping his composure when Wei Wuxian let loose what seemed to be a never ending string of his name repeated in different variations and tones until Wangji had silenced him. Even then, Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t sat still or concentrated, still wiggling and doodling and humming through his sealed lips. Lan Qiren knew his nephew well enough to have caught the twitch in his eyebrow that spoke of severe annoyance, though he was sure Wei Wuxian had missed it. \nThe Wei Wuxian that sat with him now was wholly different than that restless boy who had irked Wangji so. He was intense, concentrated. He didn\u2019t fidget or hum, he didn't even take breaks, so concentrated he was on his work. Lan Qiren wondered if it was maturity or the subject matter that drew his attention. \nHe sat still for so long that even Lan Qiren grew tired, so after just a little too long of being witness to how unnerving stillness, he sent Wei Wuxian after a few more texts, just to make him get up and stretch his legs. \nWei Wuxian was long enough for Lan Qiren to fetch their lunch, and just as Lan Qiren sat back down, Wangji appeared on the path, walking steadily towards him, still steeped in that melancholy energy he\u2019d had since he\u2019d come back from Yiling. \n\u201cI was told to find you,\u201d he said, approaching the table but refraining from sitting down. \nLan Qiren nodded, placing the food on the table as he tried to figure out where to start.\nThe chance was taken from him when Wangji looked towards the path. Lan Qiren watched as Wangji\u2019s face paled and then flushed as the most expression Lan Qiren had seen since Wangji had been too young to control his reactions crossed over his face. \n\u201cWei Ying?\u201d He breathed, and then again, louder, almost too loud, \u201cWei Ying!\u201d\nLan Qiren looked to where Wangji had caught sight of Wei Wuxian who was returning with his armful of texts. It seemed like he hadn\u2019t noticed Wangji before he shouted. \n\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian called, catching sight of Wangji who still looked as if he was trying to determine whether or not he was dreaming. \u201cYou\u2019re back!\u201d\nWhen he raised his hand to wave, the texts tumbled from his arms onto the ground, and Lan Qiren had to resist the urge to bury his face in his hand. This was the Yiling Patriarch? \nThe falling of the texts startled Wangji into action. He moved in an instant, stepping between Lan Qiren and Wei Wuxian with a resolved set to his mouth. Lan Qiren saw his hand tighten on his sword, but, thankfully, he didn\u2019t draw it as he looked torn between turning to face Wei Wuxian and making sure Lan Qiren wasn't going to attack him. Lan Qiren would find it sweet if he wasn\u2019t the villain in the scenario. \n\u201cWangji,\u201d he barked out, startling Wei Wuxian, and causing Wangji\u2019s eyes to harden. \u201cWei Wuxian and I have work to do, and I suggest you leave us to it. You have your own duties.\u201d \nWangji stared at him in disbelief as Wei Wuxian gathered the texts that had fallen back into his arms again and bounded around his protective stance to join Lan Qiren at the table. \nDespite Lan Wangji lingering awkwardly by the table, Wei Wuxian sat and started sorting through the texts he\u2019d gathered like nothing was out of the ordinary. Wangji turned his stare to Lan Qiren, expecting an answer. \nWei Wuxian also looked to him, giving a complicated series of facial expressions and hand motions that Lan Qiren realized, with no small measure of resignation, he could interpret perfectly. Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t want Wangji to know what they were doing. \n\u201cWangji, the work we are doing must be kept under utmost secrecy,\u201d Lan Qiren said, narrowing his eyes at Wei Wuxian for making him dismiss his nephew who obviously wanted nothing more than to bundle Wei Wuxian up and keep him close. \nIt wasn\u2019t a lie, technically. They didn\u2019t want any of this getting out, not that Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t have a core and certainly not that they were trying to find a way for him to form a new one. He didn\u2019t understand why Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t want Wangji to know, but that wasn\u2019t his decision to make. \n\u201cI will not tell,\u201d Wangji said with a nod, moving to help Wei Wuxian sort the texts that were on the table in front of him. \nAt Wei Wuxian\u2019s expression of increasing frantic insistence, Lan Qiren sighed with another glare.\n\u201cYou misunderstand, Wangji,\u201d he said. \u201cI am asking you to leave.\u201d\nLan Qiren really didn\u2019t want to be the cause of any friction between him and his nephew, but he also didn\u2019t want to just override Wei Wuxian\u2019s wishes, especially on something that was so personal.\n\u201cYeah, Lan Zhan, don\u2019t worry about us,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, patting Wangji\u2019s arm. \u201cHow about I come find you this evening and we talk then?\u201d\nHe then picked up the text in front of him in a deliberate motion to show Wangji he was actually working. \n\u201cGo on,\u201d he said, shooing Wangji in the direction of the pathway with his hand. \nWei Wuxian batted his eyelashes and smiled up at Wangji, and Lan Qiren, regrettably, had to bear witness to the way his nephew melted before his eyes. \nAt Wangji\u2019s nod, Lan Qiren said, \u201cFind your brother. He will tell you everything.\u201d\nWangji glanced at Lan Qiren who stared back resolutely, before he nodded again and then left, though not without one last look over his shoulder at Wei Wuxian, expression tinged with both confusion and worry. \nOnce Wangji had left, Lan Qiren went back to his work, ignoring the concerned glances Wei Wuxian continued shooting towards the space Wawangji had just vacated. \n\u201cIf only my nephew wasn\u2019t infatuated with you,\u201d Lan Qiren muttered, mostly to himself. \u201cHe was the perfect disciple before you interrupted his education.\u201d\nWithout warning, Wei Wuxian jumped to his feet, tripping over the hem of his robe in the process and promptly tumbling over the table in front of him, bringing down both a stack of texts and the food Lan Qiren had placed on the table with him. He thankfully hadn\u2019t landed on Lan Qiren, though he hadn\u2019t escaped getting splashed with soup. Lan Qiren surely had changed much since Wei Wuxian\u2019s time as his student because, instead of turning red and punishing him, he merely ignored Wei Wuxian\u2019s disruption as best he could, though he did scowl down at the lines he was carefully copying into his notes, lines that were now smeared on the crumpled paper and covered in splashes of both ink and soup. \n\u201cInfatuated?\u201d Wei Wuxian demanded as he scrambled to right the tray even though its entire contents had already coated the front of his robe. \u201cYour nephew isn\u2019t infatuated with me! Lan Zhan hates me! Or tolerates me, but nothing like that.\u201d\nLan Qiren barked out a laugh and then clamped his mouth shut because he hadn\u2019t meant to do so.\n\u201cWei Wuxian, you certainly are a fool,\u201d he said, lifting his eyes to scowl at the mess instead of his notes. \u201cMy nephew would move the heavens and earth for you. He would capture moonbeams in a kettle and brew them as tea if you asked him to just to see you smile. I daresay my nephew is smitten, and if you are unaware, then you are blind as well as foolish.\u201d\nWith every word, Wei Wuxian\u2019s breath came a little quicker and his cheeks grew a little pinker. Lan Qiren wondered if he would accuse him of lying, but even if Lan Qiren wasn\u2019t an honest person by nature and by rules, he had no reason to trick Wei Wuxian this way. \n\u201cI have to go,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispered.\nIt was only then that Lan Qiren realized what he\u2019d just revealed to Wei Wuxian. No doubt Wangji would be mortified, but if the dazed smile on Wei Wuxian\u2019s flushed face was any indicator, his feelings were, if not wholeheartedly returned, at least welcome.\n\u201cYou can go later,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of things. Surely you won\u2019t forget this in the time between now and when you meet Wangji.\u201d\nHe really wanted to erase this conversation from Wei Wuxian\u2019s mind, but that was impossible, so he did the next best thing which was ignoring him. \nWei Wuxian threw himself backwards with a wail. \n\u201cBut how am I meant to concentrate on anything else?\u201d He bawled. \u201cYou just told me that Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t hate me! That he might even like me and now I\u2019m supposed to just sit here and read in silence?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nAfter another wail and a full minute of undignified squirming where he lay on the ground being ignored by Lan Qiren, Wei Wuxian finally pulled himself together. Lan Qiren was almost certain that Wei Wuxian stuck his tongue out at him, but he was still ignoring him, so he didn\u2019t mention it. There were a few moments of beautiful, blissful silence while Wei Wuxian righted himself at the table and Lan Qiren continued scowling down at the text in his hand. \n\u201cHypothetically,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, which was never a good sign. \u201cWould you say that Lan Zhan is infatuated with me enough that he would kiss me while I was blindfolded?\u201d \nLan Qiren had never experienced qi deviation before, but the feeling rushing through him now must have been comparable. His brush fell from his fingers, and he spluttered, trying to form a response from a mind that was shattered in those few words. There were rules, Choose your words wisely and speak clearly, but if Wei Wuxian mentioned either of them, Lan Qiren would throw his brush at him. \n\u201cHow dare you?\u201d He asked when his mind finally cleared enough for words. \u201cWangji would never. Wangji is\u2014he\u2019s.\u201d Wangji was a Lan. Too much like a Lan, embarrassingly so. \u201cWangji\u2026\u201d He trailed off as he realized that what Wei Wuxian had absolutely described was something that his quiet, repressed, infatuated, nephew would do.\nLan Qiren buried his face in his hands and let out a weary sigh. \n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said, though he could have said, probably, or even, almost positively. Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t need any more reasons to go chasing after his nephew right then. \u201cHow could I have raised such a child?\u201d He lamented. \nWei Wuxian let out an astonished, breathless laugh, and Lan Qiren looked up to find him with a hand pressed to his lips and a blush burning his face a bright red. \n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not all your influence,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, still staring off where Wangji had left earlier. \u201cI was raised by Madame Yu and look at me.\u201d\nLan Qiren wasn\u2019t tempted to smile, but he bit the inside of his cheek anyway in case one slipped out anyway. \n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\nHe found himself with an almost fond look to his face before he remembered himself and returned to scowling. \n\u201cClean your mess up!\u201d\nThe next morning Wei Wuxian showed up looking well rested, well fed, and happier than Lan Qiren could remember seeing him since he was causing mischief in his classroom. He refused to examine why Wei Wuxian looked so much better, especially since he\u2019d heard report from Xichen that Wei Wuxian was never seen leaving Wangji\u2019s home the night before. He was wearing the pale blue robes that Wangji had requested weeks ago and Lan Qiren decided that he just wouldn\u2019t look at him for the rest of the day lest he accidentally divine something about his nephew that he would prefer to remain in the dark about.\nWei Wuxian was as diligent in his study as he\u2019d been the day before, but he was more willing to take breaks. On one such break, as they had a cup of tea, Wei Wuxian looked at him with a guarded expression. It took him a moment to speak, but Lan Qiren was no stranger to patience, so he just waited for Wei Wuxian to gather his words. \n\u201cCan you tell me about my mother?\u201d He asked eventually. \nLan Qiren hadn\u2019t expected such a question, so he didn\u2019t answer immediately, but Wei Wuxian seemed to mistake his surprise as unwillingness to answer. \n\u201cIt\u2019s only, Sect Leader Jiang didn\u2019t talk about her much because of Madame Yu and I don\u2019t know very many people who knew her and you compared me to her once so you must have known her.\u201d\nIt all came out in a rush, and Lan Qiren held up a hand to stop him from rambling any farther. \n\u201cYour mother came to Cloud Recesses to study when I was younger,\u201d he said, thinking back to those days when he was young and his brother and he were still close and students teased him instead of cowered in fear. \u201cShe caused me no end of grief. She was much like you and I was much like my nephew, and she bothered me ceaselessly.\u201d\nWei Wuxian curled his lip. \n\u201cOh gross, were you and my mom\u2026\u201d He trailed off with a suggestive look to Lan Qiren.\nLan Qiren almost choked on his mouthful of tea. \n\u201cOf course not!\u201d He barked, hoping he wasn\u2019t flushing from embarrassment. \nHe was too old to be embarrassed over such things. If Lan Qiren had had a little crush on her when he was young, then that was no one\u2019s business but his own. Besides, it hadn\u2019t been more than a little bit of childish infatuation towards the first person Lan Qiren had ever seen question authority out loud and in their face. Wei Wuxian certainly didn\u2019t need to know any of that. \n\u201cHmm,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, which wasn\u2019t promising, before he fell silent. \nLan Qiren had spent enough time around Wei Wuxian to know that if the conversation ended abruptly to a long silence, Wei Wuxian was thinking up a question that would ignite either rage or embarrassment in him, usually both. \n\u201cIf things had gone differently, would you have been my dad?\u201d\nRegrettably, as Lan Qiren sputtered, Wen Qing rounded the bend with little Wen Yuan clinging to her back, chattering away. \n\u201cI see you two are having fun,\u201d she said, sitting down beside them and placing Wen Yuan on Wei Wuxian\u2019s lap who cooed and cuddled him close. \n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d Lan Qiren muttered. \nWen Qing just raised her eyebrow, which somehow felt like commiseration and judgement in one. \n\u201cWei Wuxian told me that you\u2019re trying to find a way to restore his core,\u201d she said, tugging Wei Wuxian\u2019s notes in front of her to glance over them. \u201cYou should know that I\u2019ve done much research to try and help Wen Zhuliu\u2019s victims, and I\u2019ve never come close short of\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSomething!\u201d Wei Wuxian interrupted loudly, startling Wen Yuan in his arms to scramble up and cling to his neck. He turned to stare at Wen Qing with eyes that were trying to communicate something to her. \u201cSomething that is a secret,\u201d he hissed at a much more acceptable volume.\nBefore any of them could say anything else, Wen Yuan slapped his little hands over Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth. \n\u201cXian-gege,\u201d Wen Yuan said urgently. \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to be loud here, Lan-shushu said. It\u2019s against the rules\u201d\nLan Qiren felt like they should put that boy into classes as soon as he was old enough since he seemed like he would make a fine disciple. Despite being raised by Wei Wuxian, he still seemed so receptive of rules. \nThen he remembered what else the boy had said.\n\u201cLan-shushu?\u201d Lan Qiren asked. \n\u201cZewu-jun,\u201d Wen Qing clarified. \u201cHe seemed ecstatic to be called that and told us not to scold A-Yuan for it.\u201d\nLan Qiren resisted the urge to sigh. Xichen had always had a soft spot for little children, and Lan Qiren couldn\u2019t blame him. \nWei Wuxian gathered Wen Yuan up, then, so that they were eye to eye. \n\u201cA-Yuan, please don\u2019t tell me you like your Lan-shushu the best,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cThat would make me cry.\u201d\nWen Yuan patted his cheeks and said, \u201cNope,\u201d but before Wei Wuxian\u2019s blinding smile could fully form, he continued, \u201cI like Rich-gege the best!\u201d\nWen Qing and Lan Qiren shared a longsuffering look as Wei Wuxian let out a wail and buried his face in Wen Yuan\u2019s shoulder to let out fake heaving sobs until Wen Yuan told him that he was his favorite, too. \n\u201cRich-gege and Xian-gege are both my favorites,\u201d he petting Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair with his chubby little hand in comfort. \nWei Wuxian finally ended his sobs and pulled his face from Wen Yuan\u2019s shoulder only to tickle the boy\u2019s tummy until he let out a peal of sweet giggles and say, \u201cAnd don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d He looked up to find both Lan Qiren and Wen Qing staring, but he didn\u2019t seem embarrassed, he just grinned and said, \u201cHe likes me best.\u201d\n\u201cI believe you\u2019re tied for best,\u201d Wen Qing said with one delicately raised eyebrow. \u201cAnd only because of your emotional blackmail.\u201d\nWei Wuxian pouted. \n\u201cIt still counts. A-Yuan, tell her it still counts.\u201d\n\u201cIt still counts, Qing-jie,\u201d Wen Yuan said, before becoming distracted with all the papers on the table, examining them seriously even though Lan Qiren was fairly certain he was too young to be able to read. \n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Wei Wuxian asked Wen Qing. \n\u201cI want to help.\u201d\nWen Qing was focused and serious. She already had a great well of knowledge about cores, though that was to be expected, and her medical knowledge was handy. With Wen Yuan there, Wei Wuxian was more prone to moving around and making noise, but Wen Qing was a quiet and respectful research partner. \nWangji was the one who brought them their lunch, which meant that no one could warn him before he found Wen Qing helping them. He didn\u2019t quite pout when he realized she was there, but his shoulders slumped just a little when he caught sight of her helping them. \n\u201cI thought it was secret,\u201d he said. \nWei Wuxian shot a panicked look at Lan Qiren before turning to Wangi with a regretful smile. \n\u201cWen Qing already knew,\u201d he said. \nWangji\u2019s shoulders drooped just the slightest bit more. \n\u201cAnd A-Yuan?\u201d\n\u201cI already know!\u201d He chirped, reaching up for Wangji to pick him up. \nLan Qiren was pretty certain he didn\u2019t actually know and was just repeating what Wei Wuxian and said, but Wangji seemed to take it as confirmation that he was the only one who was being kept in the dark. \nHe gave a stiff nod as he picked Wen Yuan up and settled him on his hip. Wen Yuan yawned once and then snuggled closer to Wangji, tucking his head into the crook of Wangji\u2019s neck.\n\u201cI know!\u201d Wei Wuxian said. \u201cHow about you take A-Yuan for his nap!\u201d \nWei Wuxian caught Wangji\u2019s hand and brought it to his mouth to press a kiss to his knuckles which wasn\u2019t a vulgar display, but still one that Lan Qiren didn\u2019t particularly need to see. Wangji\u2019s face softened just a hair before he glanced at Wen Qing again and that soft expression turned sour. Even another kiss to his knuckles didn\u2019t keep his face from hardening. \n\u201cNot tired,\u201d Wen Yuan muttered, though his eyes had already slipped shut. \nWangji let out a little, resigned sigh before pulling his hand from Wei Wuxian\u2019s and excusing himself to leave the way he came, feet dragging as much as he ever let his feet drag. \n\u201cI bet he feels like an underappreciated wife,\u201d Wen Qing muttered once he was out of earshot, causing Wei Wuxian to gasp and Lan Qiren to hide a smile behind his teacup.\nThe Wen Remnants hadn't been in Cloud Recesses for a full week yet when Sect Leader Jiang stomped up to the gates and ordered to be allowed entrance.\n\u201cWhere is Wei Wuxian?\u201d Jiang Wanyin demanded once he was in front of Lan Qiren, sounding every bit as fierce as his mother in her prime. \u201cHe\u2019s here, isn\u2019t he? He is a disciple of YunmengJiang and if you have taken it upon yourselves to discipline him in our stead.\u201d\nLan Qiren sighed. He\u2019d had a headache all morning and all the intense study he\u2019d done hadn\u2019t helped. Now he had to deal with this, and it made him want to go to bed early, but, regrettably, he hadn't had the chance yet. \n\u201cWei Wuxian isn\u2019t being punished,\u201d he said. \u201cHe and the Wen are under our protection.\u201d\nJiang Wanyin took a step back, obviously shocked. \n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cUpon observation of the settlement in the Burial Mounds, we came to the conclusion that Jin Guangshan lied about the particulars concerning his treatment of the Wen prisoners in his custody.\u201d\nLan Qiren glanced at the door as Wei Wuxian and Wangji entered in a rush, most likely drawn by Jiang Wanyin\u2019s raised voice. They were at Jiang Wanyin\u2019s back, so he hadn\u2019t seen them yet, and Lan Qiren didn\u2019t know whether he should let him know they were there, or signal to them that they should make themselves scarce until Jiang Wanyin calmed down. \n\u201cI thought everyone knew they\u2019d lied?\u201d Jiang Wanyin said, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s what Jin do.\u201d\nIf anyone from the Jin Sect were in attendance, that would be an unforgivable slight, but Lan Qiren was willing to let it slide.\n\u201cYou knew and you did nothing?\u201d Lan Qiren asked. \nJiang Wanyin\u2019s scoff was disrespectful, but seeing as he was a sect leader and not Lan Qiren\u2019s student, there was little he could do about that . \n\u201cWhat could I do? The Jiang Sect barely has anything, how could we stand against Jin Guangshan?\u201d\nWei Wuxian barked out a laugh from where he stood, startling Jiagn Wanyin to spin around and face him. \n\u201cHe had a conflict of interest,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, walking farther into the room. \u201cWho would believe a man standing up for his brother. You might have just called him naive and dismissed his claims. What good would that have done him?\u201d\nLan Qiren\u2019s head was pounding, and he really wished that this could wait. \n\u201cYou both make fair points,\u201d he said. \nJiang Wanyin turned back to Lan Qiren with narrowed, suspicious eyes. \n\u201cIf Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t being punished, then why wasn\u2019t he sent to Lotus Pier?\u201d He asked. \nLan Qiren couldn\u2019t help but raise a dubious eyebrow. \n\u201cI thought he wasn\u2019t a part of your sect anymore.\u201d\nFrom what he\u2019d heard, there was a duel that left both of them wounded and Wei Wuxian kicked from the Jiang Sect. He remembered Wangji pointedly saying nothing about it to accentuate the way he silently seethed at the news. \nJiang Wanyin pulled his upper lip back to bare his teeth, Zidan crackling on his fist. \n\u201cHe should be in Lotus Pier. You can\u2019t just keep him here if he doesn\u2019t want to be.\u201d\nIt was then that Wei Wuxian walked between Jiang Wanyin and Lan Qiren, Wangji close at his side with a hand on Bichen, not taking his eyes from Jiang Wanyin like he was afraid he would hurt Wei Wuxian. From what Lan Qiren had heard, his fear wasn\u2019t completely unfounded. \n\u201cJiang Cheng, they aren\u2019t keeping me here against my will,\u201d he said. \nJiang Wanyin hesitated for a moment and then scoffed, like he thought Wei Wuxian was joking. \n\u201cWhat, are you staying here to try and get out of helping us rebuild?\u201d He asked in his harsh tone. \nThere was something vulnerable in his eyes, and Lan Qiren remembered something he\u2019d realized about Jiang Wanyin when he\u2019d been his student. Where Wei Wuxian covered his emotions up with a smile, Jiang Wanyin covered his with anger and pretending not to care.\n\u201cI want to stay here,\u201d Wei Wuxian said simply. \nHurt flashed over Jiang Wanyin\u2019s face but it was quickly replaced by anger. \n\u201cFine. If that\u2019s what you want,\u201d he spit out, making to turn and leave, only stopped by Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand on his arm. \n\u201cNo, Jiang Cheng, that\u2019s not it.\u201d\n\u201cThen what is it?\u201d He demanded. \u201cWhat else could make you stay here instead of at home where you belong? If you were still hiding in your cursed Burial Mounds, I could understand, but here?\u201d\nThe words rang in the room, not quite an echo, but lingering in the air. Wei Wuxian seemed so small, even though he was slightly taller than Jiang Wanyin. The hand not clutching Jiang Wanyin\u2019s sleeve was curled close to his chest and he was heaving quick breaths. If Lan Qiren could see his face, he felt like his eyes might be shining with tears. \n\u201cJiang Cheng,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispered, and then again, stepping closer, \u201cJiang Cheng.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jiang Wanyin barked. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to come home, Jiang Cheng,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, quietly, carefully.\n\u201cThen come home.\u201d\nWei Wuxian let go of Jiang Wanyin\u2019s sleeve to take a step back.\n\u201cI need to be here,\u201d he said firmly. \nJiang Wanyin followed his step. \n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cJiang Cheng\u2014\u201c\n\u201cTell me why? Is it because of Lan Wangji?\u201d He took another step closer, crowding Wei Wuxian into taking another step back. \u201cDid you decide that he was more important to you than me? That he can protect you better that I can?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Jiang Cheng, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, is it that you have a new family now?\u201d Jiang Wanyin continued. \u201cAre your Wen better than your actual family? You think I wouldn\u2019t help if I could?\u201d\nAnother step forward, another step back. Wangji\u2019s grip tightened on his sword but he didn\u2019t interfere either trusting Wei Wuxian to be able to hold his own if anything happened or trusting his own ability to fly across the room and intervene before any damage could be done. \n\u201cJiang Cheng, of course\u2014\u201d\nJiang Wanyin flexed the hand where Zidan was still sparking across his fingers, and Lan Qiren readied himself to intervene if it came to anything more than shouting. \n\u201cThen why won\u2019t you just come home?\u201d He demanded. \n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTell me why!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a core!\u201d Wei Wuxian shouted, forcing Jiang Wanyin back with his own step forward. \nThe Wangji and Jiang Wanyin took the same shocked inhale, but Wei Wuxian continued.\n\u201cMaster Lan is trying to find a way to help me restore it,\u2019 he said in a lower tone that was still loud in the quiet room.\nJiang Wanyin stared at Wei Wuxian with a crazed look that Lan Qiren didn\u2019t know how to interpret. His eyes were wide with an indecipherable mix of emotions that eventually settled on questioning.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d He asked in a small, hurt voice before anger overtook his features. \u201cWe could have helped you if you\u2019d only\u2014\u201d A pause as his face flickered back to questioning. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go to Baoshan Sanren?\u201d\nBaoshan Sanren?\nWei Wuxian glanced at Lan Qiren out of the corner of his eye briefly, but Lan Qiren caught it and put to mind to gather answers from the boy later. \nIt was painfully obvious that Wei Wuxian\u2019s responding laugh was forced.\n\u201cCould I climb a mountain for the second time and request yet another core?\u201d He asked. He didn\u2019t look back to Lan Qiren, but Wangji did. He had a question in his eyes that Lan Qiren didn\u2019t have the answer to, though he was beginning to piece something together. \u201cShe\u2019d think me careless and send me away, wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d\nWei Wuxian had lost his core before? He\u2019d had it restored before? \nWei Wuxian ducked his head so he didn\u2019t see the guilt that flashed over Jiang Wanyin\u2019s face, but Lan Qiren caught it. \n\u201cSo I stole your only chance?\u201d Jiang Wanyin asked in a broken voice. \nLan Qiren remembered, then, Wei Wuxian words from their journey to Cloud Recesses: I gave it away. I offered my core in exchange for my brother\u2019s life.\nAnother piece slotted into place. Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t been the one to get his core restored by Baoshan Sanren, but Jiang Wanyin. It must have been. Wei Wuxian must have offered up his own core as payment for Baoshan Sanren restoring Jiang Wanyin\u2019s. \nWhat a terrible sacrifice. \n\u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change anything that happened, so you shouldn\u2019t get stuck in any regrets. I won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\nLan Qiren recognized Madame Yu in the dark look on Jiang Wanyin\u2019s face before he turned on his heel and stalked from the room. \nWangji rushed forward and gathered Wei Wuxian close as soon as Jiang Wanyin stalked off, closing him in his arms before his legs grew too weak to hold himself up. Lan Qiren was startled to see tears on Wangji\u2019s cheeks. \n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he whispered. \nWei Wuxian turned to bury his face in Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. \nHe mumbled something that Lan Qiren could not hear, but Wangji nodded and led him out of the room. \nOnce they were gone, Lan Qiren let out a breath and decided that they would be done for the day. Wei Wuxian likely wasn\u2019t coming back, Wen Qing was at the site of the new settlement with Xichen trying to plan out where they were going to build, and Lan Qiren still had a headache.\nThe next day Wei Wuxian showed up at Lan Qiren\u2019s garden almost as soon as the morning chime sounded. His eyes were bloodshot and red-rimmed, and Wangji was at his side. \nNo one said anything as they sat down and began to work. Lan Qiren almost wanted to ask if Wei Wuxian had talked to Jiang Wanyin or ask questions about Wei Wuxian\u2019s missing core, but he was afraid Wei Wuxian might cry and he didn\u2019t want that. \nAn hour or so later, Wen Qing showed up with a sleeping Wen Yuan in her arms. \n\u201cHe cried until I told him he could visit his Xian-gege,\u201d she said as she passed him into Wei Wuxian\u2019s arms. \nThat seemed to perk Wei Wuxian up a little, but he still seemed lost in his own head. \nThey worked in silence for the most part. When Wen Yuan woke up, he busied himself with painting a picture from where he sat in Wei Wuxian\u2019s lap. He\u2019d promised very seriously not to get any ink on the books, but they were all keeping them out of reach just in case. \nAfter a while, Wei Wuxian broke the silence. \n\u201cI gave my core to Jiang Cheng,\u201d he admitted. \nLan Qiren jerked his head from the characters he was examining to look at Wei Wuxian. Neither Wangji nor Wen Qing looked surprised, so Lan Qiren figured they\u2019d already been told. \n\u201cSharing is good,\u201d Wen Yuan said from his perch in Wei Wuxian\u2019s lap, not even looking up. \nWei Wuxian, careful of the ink on Wen Yuan\u2019s brush, squeezed the boy close to his chest. \n\u201cWen Zhuliu melted Jiang Cheng\u2019s core and Wen Qing removed mine to give to Jiang Cheng.\u201d\nLan Qiren shot his gaze to Wen Qing who didn\u2019t hide under his scrutiny. She tilted her chin up and met his eyes.\n\u201cSo this is what you meant when you said you had previous experience,\u201d he said. \nShe nodded. \n\u201cThere was a very high chance of failure, but Wei Wuxian wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer when I told him that there was even the slightest chance of success.\u201d\nLan Qiren turned to Wei Wuxian who was staring down at A-Yuan\u2019s little hand gripping the too-big brush as he painted some indecipherable smear of shapes across the paper before him. \n\u201cWhy?\u201d He asked. \nWei Wuxian looked up to meet his eyes, his mouth a harsh line on his face, slipping up into a rueful smile. \n\u201cHe\u2019s my brother. There\u2019s nothing I wouldn\u2019t do to keep him safe.\u201d\nLan Qiren\u2019s heart stuttered in his chest and he clenched his jaw shut against the wave of emotion that threatened to fill him up. He\u2019d known that kind of sibling bond before, but it had been so long. Wangji and Xichen\u2019s closeness had never struck him this hard, but something about Wei Wuxian\u2019s own casual willingness to give everything up for his brother made him remember every time he plead with his own brother to come out of seclusion, every time he begged on behalf of their sect, of his nephews, of himself drowning under the weight of the responsibility he\u2019d never expected to have. \n\u201cWhat of Baoshan Sanren?\u201d He asked to clear his throat. \u201cHow did she help?\u201d\nWei Wuxian let out a weak laugh and rubbed the tip of his nose with the back of his knuckle. \n\u201cWell, she didn\u2019t actually help, we just told Jiang Cheng she was the one to restore his core so that there wasn\u2019t any way he could guess what had actually happened. We needed an excuse and what\u2019s more convenient than an immortal who I have a personal connection to that never comes down from her mountain to refute our story?\u201d \n\u201cAnd he couldn\u2019t sense that the core was yours?\u201d He asked, intrigued. \u201cSurely you were at least passingly familiar with one anothers\u2019 cores to sense something like that.\u201d\nWen Qing was the one to answer.\n\u201cI theorized that since they were raised in the same sect with exactly the same cultivation styles, that the difference between his own core and Wei Wuxian\u2019s would hardly be noticeable. Any differences in core strength or signature he probably either assumed it was because he hadn\u2019t had a core in a while or was so relieved to have a core again that he didn\u2019t care to notice anything odd about it.\u201d\nLan Qiren wondered if Jiang Wanyin, sequestered away in his provided guest quarters, wasn\u2019t meditating hard on his core, trying to pick out the pieces of his core that still thrummed with his brother\u2019s energy. Would it frustrate him more if the energy he felt was all his own or if he caught a hint that he\u2019d overlooked before.\n\u201cHave you told Jiang Wanyin?\u201d He asked. \nWei Wuxian ducked his head the way guilty students did when Lan Qiren came across them smuggling contraband into their dorms. \n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Wangji spoke for him, though that was obvious. \nWei Wuxian turned wide pleading eyes on Wangji. \n\u201cLan Zhan, don\u2019t bully me,\u201d he whined, leaning over to cling to Wangji\u2019s arm. \u201cI told you I\u2019m going to tell him.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Wangji said, not looking up from the notes in his hand, though he did lean into Wei Wuxian\u2019s grip on his arm. \n\u201cI will, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian exclaimed. \u201cI promise. When do I ever break my promises?\u201d\nWangji continued to keep his careful, blank expression, though he did cut a look at Wei Wuxian from the corner of his eye. \nWei Wuxian made an offended noise. \n\u201cFine!\u201d He said, plopping Wen Yuan into Wangji\u2019s lap and shooting to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll go and tell him now!\u201d\nWangji just made another doubting hum, which made Wei Wuxian stalk off down the path, muttering to himself. It was only when he\u2019d gotten almost out of sight that he seemed to realize just what he\u2019d promised to do because he turned on his heel and started heading back to them. \nHe let out a weak laugh and said, \u201cAh, but what if Jiang Cheng is asleep or what if he doesn\u2019t want company. It wouldn\u2019t do to bother him. I\u2019ll just tell him later.\u201d\nJust as he went to sit down, Wangji said, \u201cWei Ying,\u201d in a low, warning voice which made Wei Wuxian huff before taking off down the path again. \nOnce he was nearly out of sight, he yelled back, \u201cIf he kills me, it\u2019s Lan Zhan\u2019s fault!\u201d\n\u201cNo shouting in Cloud Recesses,\u201d Lan Qiren called after him. \nWei Wuxian turned to call back, \u201cYeah, no shouting in Cloud Recesses, Master!\u201d \n\u201cNo shouting in Cloud Recesses,\u201d Wen Yuan repeated, but at a whisper, glancing up at Wangji. \n\u201cVery good,\u201d Wangji said, barely concealing a smile as he avoided Lan Qiren\u2019s gaze. \nWen Wen Qing very carefully didn\u2019t look at any of them, but she was shaking her head, and Lan Qiren almost felt chastised just that she behaved herself better than he did. \nThey worked long enough for Wen Yuan to nap in Wangji\u2019s lap and then wake up groggy and whiny. Lan Qiren had been tasked with holding him while Wangji retrieved him a snack and Wen Qing excused herself at Xichen\u2019s request to help with the plans for the Wen settlement near the base of the mountain. Wen Yuan was a perfectly agreeable boy normally, but abandoned just to Lan Qiren who he\u2019d only known for a little while, he couldn\u2019t keep himself from tears. It was probably a mixture of waking up with only Lan Qiren there and being in a new place and Wei Wuxian having left earlier that made him fussy, but he just wouldn\u2019t stop crying. Lan Qiren was contemplating getting up to find Wangji when he was interrupted. \n\u201cAya, what are you doing to my poor little radish?\u201d Wei Wuxian called out suddenly, approaching the table with Jiang Wanyin at his side. \u201cOnly a brute would make him cry like that!\u201d\nWen Yuan jerked his head up immediately at his voice, letting out a loud wail as he reached for Wei Wuxian. Lan Qiren would almost feel offended if he wasn\u2019t so relieved that the boy was going to stop crying soon. \n As they approached, Jiang Wanyin elbowed Wei Wuxian in the side and hissed, \u201cDon\u2019t speak to your elders that way!\u201d\nWei Wuxian ignored him in favor of swooping in and collecting Wen Yuan into his arms, cuddling him close to his chest and soothing a hand over his back. Lan Qiren was sure there was a wet patch on his own shoulder where Wen Yuan had spent the last several minutes inconsolable, but he elected to ignore it. It wasn\u2019t the first time a child had cried on his shoulder and it probably wouldn\u2019t be the last. Not that children made a habit of crying when he held them, he was simply often put in charge of children who were either already crying or easy to be swayed to tears. Xichen had cried often. Wangji preferred to pout, but little Xichen would cry at nearly anything, happy or sad. On one memorable occasion, Wangji, barely two and still unsteady on his feet, had tripped over the hem of his own robe, and the tumble he took made Xichen cry so hard that he\u2019d cried himself to sleep, while Wangji just stood back up and kept toddling. \n\u201cHis hair tickled my ear,\u201d Wen Yuan said, taking a deep, sobbing breath after each word ashe buried his snotty nose in Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder, who didn\u2019t even flinch, perhaps used to that. \n\u201cAh, how terrible,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. \u201cWhat should we do to punish him?\u201d \nHe winked at Lan Qiren which was not appreciated. Lan Qiren pointedly didn\u2019t look to where Jiang Wanyin was hovering uncomfortably by Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder because he feared that awkward eye contact might occur. \nWen Yuan just shook his head against Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder as his sobs subsided. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to take a nap,\u201d he whined. \nWei Wuxian patted his back in consolation. \n\u201cHave you already had a nap today?\u201d He asked. \nThat kickstarted another round of tears as Wen Yuan sobbed out, \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cHe did,\u201d Wangji said, rounding the corner, eyeing Jiang Wanyin warily. \nWen Yuan looked up from Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder to lunge for Wangji, though to be held by him or to get hs snack, Lan Qiren didn\u2019t know. \n\u201cA-Yuan,\u201d Wei Wuxian scolded, leaning over Wangi\u2019s shoulder to tweak the boy\u2019s nose. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to nap if you already took one.\u201d\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d Wen Yuan said with a pout, turning his head away from Wei Wuxian. \n\u201cLying is forbidden,\u201d Lan Qiren found himself saying.\nWen Yuan sat up suddenly with wide eyes as his face crumpled and he let out another loud wail. He didn\u2019t bury his face back in Wangji\u2019s shoulder, apparently too overcome to do anything but bring his chubby fists up to his eyes as he sobbed in Wangji\u2019s arms. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave,\u201d he cried between sobs. \u201cI\u2019ll be good. I promise. I\u2019ll follow the rules.\u201d\nWei Wuxian crowded close to wrap his arms around Wen Yuan and Wangji both while Wangji rubbed his hand over Wen Yuan\u2019s back and drew him close to his chest. \n\u201cNo one\u2019s going to make you leave, A-Yuan,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. \nHe didn\u2019t even spare a glance towards Lan Qiren, not even to glare as he brushed Wen Yuan\u2019s hair back from his forehead and the tears from his chubby cheeks. \n\u201cA-Yuan, it doesn\u2019t matter how many rules you break, no one is going to kick you out,\u201d he continued, barely able to speak over Wen Yuan\u2019s cries. \u201cRight, Lan Zhan?\u201d\nWhen Wangji had been little, he\u2019d somehow gotten it into his head that someone was keeping track of every rule he\u2019d ever broken, and that some day, the number was going to get so high that they would lock him away and not let him see anyone. Lan Qiren found out later that one of the older disciples told Wangji that was what happened to his parents. When Lan Qiren discovered Wangji, hiding in his room, trying to hold in the sobs that slipped out anyway, he\u2019d felt such a surge of protectiveness that it scared him. \n\u201cOf course, you have to follow the rules,\u201d he\u2019d told little A-Zhan as he tucked him into bed, still crying and still trying to hide it lest he exhibit excessive emotion and that be added to his tally. \u201cBut you won\u2019t be locked away.\u201d\nThat had seemed to assure Wangji who wiped his cheeks with his sleeves and finally turned to face him. \n\u201cWhat happens when someone breaks too many rules?\u201d\nLan Qiren, relieved that Wangji was no longer crying, had answered without thinking. \n\u201cThey go in front of the Elders, and if they are found unwilling to keep with the Lan standards, they have to turn in their headbands and leave Cloud Recesses.\u201d\nLittle Wangji had clutched at his own ribbon with a white-knuckled grip and sobbed until he\u2019d cried himself to sleep. Nothing Lan Qiren or Xichen had been able do had been enough to stop him then, and, in that moment, Lan Qiren had felt helpless. \n\u201cNo one will kick you out,\u201d Wangji agreed, tone serious and consoling as he soothed his hand over Wen Yuan\u2019s back. \u201cI will not let them.\u201d\nLan Qiren wondered if Wangji was remembering the same thing he was, and he suddenly felt ashamed. He\u2019d had how many years of raising Wangji and Xichen before him? Wangji hadn\u2019t known Wen Yuan for very long, yet he knew exactly what to say to get the boy to calm down. \nOnce Wen Yuan finished his final sniffles, nestled into Wangji\u2019s collar bone, he was easily placated with the snack that Wangji had brought for him. \nJiang Wanyin, still hovering awkwardly at the edge of the garden cleared his throat, and Wangji and Wei Wuxian, caught in their own world, turned to him finally. Wangji didn\u2019t say anything, he just narrowed his eyes, but Wei Wuxian jumped into action. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked it out!\u201d He exclaimed, tugging Jiagn Wanyin by the elbow, forcing his arms uncrossed as he pulled him to the table. \u201cJiang Cheng cried a little bit but we\u2019re better now and he wants to help.\u201d\n\u201cI did not!\u201d Jiang Wanyin growled, face dark red as he let Wei Wuxian lead him to their table. \nWangji very deliberately spread out Wen Yuan\u2019s, Wei Wuxian\u2019s, and his supplies so that Jiang Wanyin wouldn\u2019t be able to fit on their side of the table, so Jiang Wanyin took Wen Qing\u2019s spot next to Lan Qiren. \nIf Lan Qiren had been under the impression that doing research alone with Wei Wuxian would be awkward and annoying, it was nothing to having Jiang Wanyin sitting beside him with Wangji and Wei Wuxian on their own side of the table in their own little world. He was quiet and he didn't fidget, but his stillness was almost too stiff, like he was just as uncomfortable as Lan Qiren. \nAfter a bit, after granny Wen came to collect Wen Yuan for the afternoon, Wangji stood from the table to fetch a book from the library, and Wei Wuxian had jumped up and volunteered to go with him so that his \u201cEr-gege won\u2019t get lonely.\u201d Lan Qiren almost offered to go with them as well when faced with the idea of sitting next to Jiagn Wanyin who hadn\u2019t said a single word since he\u2019d sat at tha table. Lan Qiren normally wouldn\u2019t mind the silence, but he\u2019d gotten so used to both Wei Wuxian and A-Yuan constantly fidgeting, that silence almost felt unnatural. Also, it was strange that his former student was now a sect leader after so few years after leaving Cloud Recesses, and he didn\u2019t know how to combat the strange atmosphere. \n He silently fumed as Wangji and Wei Wuxian failed to return as the minutes rolled by, but then he realized he could use fetching them as an excuse to put some distance between himself and the tense atmosphere that he may or may not have imagined. He grumbled as he got up from the table to go fetch them. They had probably gotten distracted along the way and needed a reminder of the task, which wasn\u2019t like Wangji, but with Wei Wuxian at his side, Lan Qiren didn\u2019t trust him. \nThe library seemed empty when Lan Qiren entered, and he took a deep calming breath in the familiar stillness around him. He quickly realized that he was mistaken, though, when he took a step farther in and only to catch sight of two figures kneeling on the floor, wrapped around each other. He quickly shut his eyes and spun around, but nothing could erase the image of his nephew straddling Wei Wuxian\u2019s lap as they traded desperate kisses, both of their robes half undone and slipping from their shoulders. \nThey apparently hadn\u2019t even heard him come in because Lan Qiren could still hear wet smacking noises from behind him. \n\u201cWei Wuxian! Wangji!,\u201d he shouted, beyond any other words. \nThere was a crash and then a loud thump followed by a sharp exhale that might have been Wangji hitting the floor, but Lan Qiren refused to turn around. \nWei Wuxian started laughing so suddenly that it startled Lan Qiren. \n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Wangji said, reprimanding, but any authority was lost in the breathlessness of his voice. \nFor some reason this was worse than the time Lan Qiren had found Xichen in the library, mainly because neither of these two had the excuse of being fifteen to explain their lack of critical thinking. Plus, Lan Qiren hadn\u2019t known the disciple who Xichen had been tangled with, and they had both been fully clothed. This was beyond anything Lan Qiren had ever expected from this particular nephew, and he put it in mind to pray when they were done for the day. Pray for strength and patience and for that horrible image to be scrubbed from behind his eyelids. \n\u201cGet dressed!\u201d he demanded. \u201cAnd learn how to control yourselves! This is a public building!\u201d\nWei Wuxian had the audacity to laugh. \n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Master Lan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep this stuff to the jingshi.\u201d Another laugh. \u201cThough maybe we can\u2019t call it that anymore if this goes any further. Lan Zhan gets loud sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying!\u201d Wangji said, scandalized. \nBefore anything else could be said, Lan Qiren left with a cry of outrage and burning cheeks, hoping that at least Wangji was as embarrassed as he was if Wei Wuxian refused to feel shame. \nWhen Lan Qiren told Xichen what happened, he laughed so hard that he cried, and Lan Qiren left in a huff for not receiving the kind of sympathy he craved. He was almost tempted to go back to his garden to tell Jiang Wanyin just to have someone to commiserate with him, but he felt like it was probably better to try and forget what he\u2019d seen rather than continue talking about it. \nThe next time he saw Wei Wuxian, he didn\u2019t even look chastised. Instead, there was just a glow about him. Lan Qiren didn\u2019t speak to him for a full day, but Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t even mention it, content with humming some soft tune under his breath and smiling so hard that it made Lan Qiren want to throw something at him to make him stop.\n\u201cWhat exactly happens when someone transfers spiritual energy to you?\u201d Lan Qiren asked one afternoon. \u201cWhere does the energy go? How does it flow through your body?\u201d \nWei Wuxian looked up from what he was writing, startled. \n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it just slips out,\u201d he said after a moment of thought. \u201cI don\u2019t have any spiritual energy for someone\u2019s else\u2019s energy to pour into.\u201d\n\u201cMay I?\u201d Lan Qiren asked, holding out a hand for Wei Wuxian\u2019s arm. \nLan Qiren gripped his arm gently and siphoned energy into Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist, keeping a close monitor on where it went. It traveled along the normal pathways, sliding through Wei Wuxian towards where his core had been and then, after finding no purchase, away to slip back to Lan Qiren\u2019s arm holding his wrist, settling into his own core instead. \n\u201cYou need something for the spiritual energy to attach to,\u201d he muttered. \nWei Wuxian snatched his arm back. \n\u201cYeah, like a core,\u201d he said bitterly. \nLan Qiren nodded, \u201cExactly.\u201d\nThe next morning, Lan Qiren went into seclusion to meditate on his own core. Wei Wuxian had been upset that he was going to be absent at first, thinking that Lan Qiren was giving up on him without explanation, but he was easily comforted by both Wangji and himself that they weren\u2019t going to stop looking. The Lan valued righteousness, but what came most naturally to them was stubbornness. \n\u201cIt might be easier for me to help your core if I understand my own better.\u201d\nIt took two weeks of solitude for Lan Qiren to find something like a solution. \nWei Wuxian couldn\u2019t build a new core from scratch. A person couldn\u2019t form something like that from nothing. All children were born with that innate ability to cultivate a core, a well of energy that waned as a person grew older until it was too weak to form a core. Wei Wuxian\u2019s core had been removed, and his potential to cultivate a new one with it. They couldn\u2019t use a transferral of spiritual energy to grow his core either because the energy needed something to grasp once inside the body. Spiritual energy was always in motion, and a golden core helped regulate the energy and keep it moving while providing an anchor. \nLan Qiren had an idea as to what that anchor could be. \nIt took another week and a half for him to figure out that he could draw bits of his own core out of his body. The process was exhausting, but once he found a way to collect that core essence, he called Wei Wuxian to his home to test his theory. \nWei Wuxian was practically vibrating with energy as he and Wangji walked in. There was something almost feral in his eyes, like he wanted to bolt, but was afraid to. He also looked fuller-cheeked and stronger than when Lan Qiren had gone into seclusion, and Lan Qiren had a feeling that his nephew had a hand in making sure Wei Wuxian was taking care of himself. \nThat wild look never left Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes as Lan Qiren explained his theory and his process. He\u2019d already meditated that morning to gather a few drops of his core essence, so all there was left to do was to pass the energy into him. \nThe few drops traveled along Wei Wuxian\u2019s spiritual pathways. The sensation caused Wei Wuxian to shiver, but he kept his concentration, observing even more intently than Lan Qiren. It took the energy a long time to make it all the way to his core, long enough that Lan Qiren was sure their tea had grown cold, but when it reached that empty space that had housed Wei Wuxian\u2019s core, it hesitated. Lan Qiren could feel Wei Wuxian\u2019s pulse pick up underneath his fingertips, but he didn\u2019t mention it. Instead of slipping out like water from the palm of a hand, the energy spread itself thin over the emptiness from his core and settled softly in place. It remained long enough for Wei Wuxian to choke out a sob before the resentful energy that was still soaked all throughout his body devoured it. \nThe next noise out of Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth was one of frustration, but as he leapt to his feet to pace, Wangji hovering at his side, Lan Qiren\u2019s mind was already coming up with solutions. The base was there, the essence of his core had clung to the emptiness in Wei Wuxian\u2019s body just like Lan Qirne had theorized, they just needed to make sure there was nothing there that would destroy the fragile energy. They also needed to make sure thay collected enough energy for it to survive the transfer to Wei Wuxian\u2019s body for long enough for him to build it up. \n\u201cHave you let Wangji play his compositions for you?\u201d Lan Qiren asked. \nWei Wuxian paused in his pacing and blushed a dark red before glancing to Wangji and letting out a nervous huff.\n\u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d he muttered. \u201cLan Zhan said that song was only for me.\u201d\nLan Qiren closed his eyes briefly to take a deep breath before continuing. \n\u201cI mean the compositions he wrote to help purge the resentful energy from you.\u201d he clarified. He\u2019s been working at it for months, trying to find something that would help.\u201d\nThe way Wangji stared at Wei Wuxian and how Wei Wuxian scuffed the toe of his boot on the ground was answer enough. \n\u201cWangji, play for him until every bit of resentful energy is gone,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cWe need to get the resentful energy out before we can keep spiritual energy in.\u201d\nWangji nodded before turning and leaving Lan Qiren\u2019s home without another word, likely to retrieve his scores and his instrument. \n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you think this will work?\u201d Wei Wuxian asked, making to follow Wangji but pausing at the door. \u201cReally?\u201d\nLan Qiren wasn\u2019t known for being a person who would coddle someone. He was a strict teacher, an honest man, a harsh critic. He would never give someone false hope with little chance of success. It was fortunate, then, that he was nearly sure this hope wasn\u2019t unfounded. Nothing in his research or this test told him that this wouldn\u2019t work in the right conditions. \n\u201cYes.\u201d\nHe prepared a little jar, small enough to be held in the cup of two palms, squat and bulbous, made from soft green jade. Lan Qiren had spent a whole day and night infusing it with spells and spiritual energy so that nothing could leak out. He tested it once, meditating until he could draw out a small piece of the essence of his core. Only a couple of drops could be eeked out at a time, any more, he found, would render him unconscious. The process of extracting it was long, and only Lan Qiren\u2019s years of meditating had prepared him for it. It took so much meditation, a deep concentration on his own core, drawing to the surface a drop of his core\u2019s essence, meticulously cradling it the whole way. If his concentration slipped for even the slightest moment, the energy would surge back to his core and the process would have to be started over again. \nThe energy would pool in the palms that rested on his knees as he meditated and then carefully dripped into the jade jar. \nIt took enormous amounts of energy and several days for the core to be fully restored. Even with an exceptionally strong core, tearing its essence away was no small matter. Any amount shaved away had to be regained. \nWangji volunteered his energy up as soon as Lan Qiren explained the process. \nXichen had offered to help as well, but Lan Qiren wasn\u2019t comfortable without at least one of the three of Wangji, Xichen, or himself uncompromised in case of any emergencies that would arise. Jiang Wanyin had wanted to help, but he didn\u2019t seem to be able to gather his energy to dispel it like the others whether because he was so unused to that intense meditation or because the core he housed wasn\u2019t his own. \n\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad, Jiang Cheng,\u201d Wei Wuxian had comforted with limited success. \u201cWho would I be to give a gift and then try to take part of it back? My core wouldn\u2019t allow that.\u201d He\u2019d laughed, jostling Jiang Wanyin to get him to smile as well with no success. He continued anyway. \u201cWho would think my core would know courtesy so well?\u201d\nLan Qiren knew that Wei Wuxian hated watching them do this for no other reason than that they were going through all this strife for him and that he couldn\u2019t help even a little bit because even the slightest interference might disturb them. Lan Qiren knew exactly how Wei Wuxian felt because he had complained loudly and dramatically while draped over Wangji\u2019s lap during their evening meal. \nWangji hadn\u2019t even made him get up, which irked Lan Qiren almost as much as Wei Wuxian\u2019s embarrassing display. Wangji had gone as far as to pat Wei Wuxian on the head in comfort, though, at least he refrained from speaking seeing as they were in the middle of a meal. Lan Qiren looked to Xichen for support, but he had just been smiling fondly at the pair of them. It seemed it was up to Lan Qiren to be the only one with any propriety left. \n\u201cWei Wuxian, sit up. You\u2019re behaving like a child,\u201d he scolded. \u201cStop your whining and continue eating without speaking. Wen Yuan behaves better than you do.\u201d\nWei Wuxian went more boneless than before as he whined, but after a moment and a couple more pats on the head from Wangji, he sat up. Wangji looked at Lan Qiren across the table with a blank expression, but he knew him well enough to be able to feel the glare that Wangji no doubt wanted in its place. He\u2019d scold him as well, but he felt like ignoring Wangji\u2019s displeasure might irk him more than being reprimanded. \n\u201cNo talking while eating,\u201d Wei Wuxian said to Lan Qiren then, once he was upright.\nHe took a large bite to hide his grin, but Lan Qiren saw it anyway, though he refrained from speaking again, despite the twitch in his eye. \nThat was neither the first nor the last time Wei Wuxian had complained about not being able to help them, but all of them had learned how to ignore his whining. All of them but Wangji who seemed to enjoy the way Wei Wuxian sprawled over him to mope. He also seemed to shine under being able to comfort Wei Wuxian, adn Lan Qiren felt like Wei Wuxian might complain more than necessary since he seemed to enjoy Wangji\u2019s doting as much as Wangji seemed to enjoy doting.\nOf course, Wangji\u2019s attention couldn\u2019t be all on Wei Wuxian all the time, especially once he started contributing from his own core. The first time Wangji had pooled his energy, they had all watched on in astonishment as he broke his meditation with not a few drops of golden energy, but enough to nearly fill the cup of his palm. At least, they were astonished until Wangji carefully poured the energy into the jar before he tipped to the side in an unconscious state, only saved from hitting the ground by Wei Wuxian at his side. \nIt took him nearly a week to regain consciousness, and Lan Qiren forbade him from gathering that much of his core\u2019s energy again, Wei Wuxian on his side loudly supporting him which was a first. Wangji had looked like he wanted to protest, or at least stay silent and do it anyway, but Lan Qiren had had enough years teaching mischievous teenagers to interpret such things. \n\u201cIf this happens again, I will forbid you from helping completely,\u201d he said. \nWhen Wangji had been young, too young for classes, almost too young for a forehead ribbon, he\u2019d pouted often. He wasn\u2019t a discontent child, but he liked things to happen a certain way, and if he didn\u2019t get that, he would stick out his lower lip and puff his cheeks and let his eyes shine just enough that anyone would fall for it. Lan Qiren certainly had in his younger years. Once Wangji had started classes, he\u2019d stopped pouting in his quest for maturity, so Lan Qiren hadn\u2019t seen it in a while. \nHis pout now wasn\u2019t as puffy cheeked or as bright eyed, but it still had some effect. Lan Qiren was astounded that Wei Wuxian had the will to stand up to it. \n\u201cHe\u2019s right, Lan Zhan,'' Wei Wuxian said with finality. \u201cBeing cute won\u2019t help you.\u201d\nLan Qiren glanced up to Wei Wuxian to find that the reason he could resist the pout was because he wasn\u2019t looking at Wangji, instead, looking stubbornly away. \nThe more energy they pooled in the jar, the more jittery they all seemed, and the more questions seemed to be posed. \n\u201cWhat if it gets stuck in your intestines instead of the place it should be?\u201d Jiang Wanyin asked one afternoon as they figured the logistics of how to transfer the energy into Wei Wuxian in the best way. \n\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll have golden guts,\u201d Wei Wuxian said with a nervous laugh. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll have golden poop, and we can sell it and be rich.\u201d\nJiang Wanyin punched Wei Wuxian hard enough in the arm to knock him into Wangji who glared at him even as he said, \u201cWei Ying,\u201d in a warning tone.\n\u201cI know, I know, don\u2019t be vulgar,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, laying his head on Wangji\u2019s shoulder and blinking sweetly up at him. \u201cWon\u2019t you forgive this careless one\u2019s naughty tongue?\u201d\nWangji\u2019s ears turned red as he said, \u201cForgiven.\u201d\nLan Qiren wished he could forget the entire conversation, and his only reason for not regretting being there was that Wen Qing looked at him like she was thinking the exact same thing. \n\u201cWhat Sect Leader Jiang said, while impossible, is part of the reason that we need to talk about this,\u201d Wen Qing said, gathering everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cWe certainly do not want to take any risks, and while the energy will likely follow Wei Wuixan\u2019s pathways to where his core should be, we aren\u2019t quite sure how this type of energy exactly will behave. Master Lan told me that last time, the energy took a long while to reach his core, and with this much of it, there is danger of it coagulating in the wrong place which could cause problems.\u201d\nWei Wuxian let out a low moan and buried his face in his hands. \n\u201cOh no,\u201d he whined. \u201cPlease tell me you aren\u2019t going to have to cut me open.\u201d\nWen Qing raised an eyebrow at him and remained silent causing Wei Wuxian to let out another groan. \n\u201cCan I be asleep for this one?\u201d He asked. \u201cLast time wasn\u2019t fun.\u201d\nLan Qiren shot his gaze to Wei Wuxian as did Wangji and Jiang Cheng. \nLan Qiren imagined being awake and feeling his core being tugged from his chest. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be able to live with the pain, but it seemed like another thing that Wei Wuxian was willing to joke away.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jiang Cheng demanded. \u201cI was asleep last time.\u201d\nWei Wuxian averted his gaze, so Wen Qing answered. \n\u201cSect Leader Jiang was receiving a fully formed adult core that was stronger than most. This is a collection of energy, so I\u2019m not sure what will happen if you aren\u2019t awake for it.\u201d\nWei Wuxian slumped into Wangji\u2019s arms with a wail. \n\u201cLan Zhan, Wen Qing\u2019s being mean to me on purpose!\u201d He cried. \nWangji patted him on the back consolingly, but rolled his eyes where Wei Wuxian couldn\u2019t see. \nLan Qiren didn\u2019t say anything about their embarrassing display, mainly because he felt like maybe right now Wei Wuxian deserved the comfort. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Wangji said which caused Wei Wuxian to pull back and smack a kiss on his cheek. \n\u201cYou always know what to say to make me feel better!\u201d He announced. \nJiang Wanyin scoffed and shoved at Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder. \n\u201cYou\u2019re an embarrassment.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan, defend me!\u201d He cried. \nLan Qiren watched in a distant sort of astonishment as Wangu reached out and shoved Jiang Wanyin back. \nWei Wuxian laughed so hard that Wen Qing threatened to stick him with a needle if he wouldn\u2019t calm down. \nWhen the day of the procedure finally came, Wei Wuxian looked like he was equal parts ready to jump around from the amount of energy in his chest and ready to vomit what little was in his stomach. \n\u201cLan Zhan, tell me this isn\u2019t a dream,\u201d he said as Wen Qing gathered her supplies and Lan Qiren carefully sat the jar of their cores\u2019 essence on her worktable. \nHe felt protective over it. He knew it was because nearly half of the jar was his own energy, but he almost didn\u2019t want to let it out of his sight. He wondered how Wangji felt about it, seeing as the other half of the energy was his. \n\u201cYou aren\u2019t dreaming, idiot,\u201d Jiang Wanyin said from the other side of Wei Wuxian, arms crossed over his chest in a way that he probably thought was casual, that made him look like he was vastly uncomfortable. \nWangji glared at him, but didn\u2019t speak. \n\u201cJiang Cheng!\u201d Wei Wuxian squawked. \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday, you can\u2019t be mean to me.\u201d\nLan Qiren caught Wen Qing\u2019s eyeroll as she readied her supplies. \n\u201cIt isn\u2019t your birthday,\u201d Jiang Wanyin groused. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know when that is.\u201d\nWei Wuxian pouted, but LAn Qwiren figured it was because he wanted Wangji to wrap his arm around him like he did. \n\u201cWell, that means I get to decide when it is, and I say it\u2019s today so stop being mean to me.\u201d \nJiang Wanyin huffed and didn\u2019t say anything else. \nWhen Wen Qing finished preparing, she had Wei Wuxian remove his outer layers and lay back on the table. As he did so, he shivered, though the air was warm around them. Wangji took his hand in a tight grip, but Wei Wuxian still trembled, most likely from a combination of nervousness and excitement. \n\u201cAh, this is the part I\u2019m not looking forward to,\u201d he said as Wen Qing wiped a patch of his lower stomach. \nSitting low on Wei Wuxian\u2019s stomach, there was already a scar. Lan Qiren realized that this must be from the first procedure. It was simple, a small vertical line, straight and shining a silver against his skin in the light. He could see Jiang Wanyin staring as well, but instead of professional curiosity, he found regret on his face. \nWei Wuxian didn\u2019t look at any of them, too busy staring at the little vial on the table, like he couldn't tear his eyes away for anything. \nIn order for the energy to properly connect with his body and flow along his spiritual lines, he had to remain awake and lucid as Wen Qing dripped the contents of the jade vial into his chest and the rest of them fed him spiritual energy to light up his spiritual pathways, making ture the energy behaved the way they wanted it to do. \nThe process took less than an hour, but it felt like days with Wei Wuxian breathing heavily as he tried to resist crying out, biting his lips until they bled as he tried not to scream. \nAs soon as the jar was emptied completely, Wen Qing closed the wound and checked his spiritual energy until she determined that it was safe for Wei Wuxian to be given medicine to knock him out so that he could heal. THe silence was a relief, but it was also startling. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see,\u201d she said when they all looked at her for answers, \u201cBut for the moment being the energy is behaving how it should.\u201d\nLan Qiren felt for himself and let out a laugh that he hadn\u2019t meant to when he felt that fragile, new energy molding itself into place, cradled in the spiritual energy they had funneled through him, that Wangji and Jiagn Wanyin were still funneling into him. \nWei Wuxian slept for three days while the rest took turns feeding him spiritual energy to heal where he\u2019d been cut open and stabilize the new core. They all checked his core excessively, terrified that it was going to dissipate. Wangji in particular seemed obsessed with making sure the core stayed where it should be, and Lan Qiren couldn\u2019t blame him. It would be devastating for all of them if Wei Wuxian woke to find that the procedure had been unsuccessful. \nWhen Wei Wuxian did wake up, groggy and disoriented at first, he sat up, let Wangji coax him into drinking some water. It took a few moments for him to remember why he was in the infirmary, and when he did, his hand dropped to hover over where his new core lay. He trembled as he felt out his new energy, and Lan Qiren turned to give him privacy when tears started dripping down his cheeks. \n\u201cI thought I\u2019d never feel this again.\u201d\nThree weeks after a successful procedure, Wei Wuxian was getting used to his new core with the help of daily spiritual energy transferrals and training that he grumbled about even though it was obvious that he was excited to be back at it. \nHe had joined in with a class of younger junior disciples, half teaching and half training along with them. He practiced long hours to the point of exhaustion, only stopping when Wangji made him. When Lan Qiren had asked, Wei Wuxian had told him that he was training so hard so he could ride his own sword to his nephew\u2019s one month celebration. \nLan Qiren was happy to get back to work, though he would admit that sometimes he had trouble concentrating without the familiar noise of Wei Wuxian fidgeting across from him, though, of course he\u2019d never let Wei Wuxian know that. \nLately, Xichen had been in correspondence with Sect Leader Nie regarding the untruths that Jin Guangshan had told. The Lan Sect, along with the Nie and the Jiang, were preparing to confront him on his deception and other of the man\u2019s plots that had come to light. Jin Guangyao, either out of loyalty to Xichen or, more likely, sensing the shift in power from his father to the other Sects, had revealed the plots Jin Guangshan had to gain control of Wei Wuxian\u2019s seal. This, of course, hadn't set well with any of them, and they were all in agreement about the fact that they could no longer stand by and let Jin Guangshan become another Wen Ruohan. \nThe Wen settlement at the base of the mountain was almost completely built, the hard working Wen, along with Xichen and Wangji and Wei Wuxian when he could be pulled from training, had worked until the settlement looked less like a camp and more like a home. They\u2019d even started planting things to take to Caiyi and sell. \nWei Wuxian split his time between the Wen settlement and the Jingshi where Lan Qiren refused to step foot in lest he catch sight of something he would prefer not to. His one glimpse in the library had been enough for a full lifetime. \nWei Wuxian had been antsy for a few days. He was often antsy, but this particular brand of unsettled came with many blushing cheeks and unsubtle, nervous glances to Lan Qiren. It was obvious that Wei Wuxian was gearing up to get Lan Qiren\u2019s approval to marry Wangji, but it seemed that he had yet to find the bravery for it. \nOf course, his courage was gathered at the least expected moment. \nLan Qiren\u2019s morning meditation was interrupted by the sudden, horrifying sound of his guqin being knocked to the floor. \n\u201cSorry,\u201d Wei Wuxian called out, startling him almost as badly as the twang of his instrument hitting the ground. \nLan Qiren kept his eyes closed for he feared that, should he open them and see the damage Wei Wuxian had done, he might suffer a deviation not only of his qi but also of his sanity. How could he ever face Wangji again if he cut Wei Wuxian down for disturbing him before the cock had even crowed? \n\u201cMaster?\u201d Wei Wuxian said after the sounds of him righting all that he\u2019d disturbed finished. \u201cI have a question.\u201d\nOnly then did Lan Qiren open his eyes to find Wei Wuxian sitting across the table from him in the most put-together state he\u2019d ever seen him. His Lan robes were crisp and unwrinkled, unstained with either ink or the bright red Wei Wuxian insisted sneaking into every bite he took. His face and hands were clean, and his hair, instead of its usual haphazard fray, was pulled back in a manner not unlike Wangji\u2019s, tied back neatly with his red ribbon, not a single strand out of place. \nLan Qiren felt resignation and satisfaction in equal measure when he realized that there was only one reason that Wei Wuxian would approach him so early in such a state. He could tell that Wei Wuxian saw the realization in his eyes because the boy straightened his posture past the point where it was likely comfortable and pleaded with his eyes so desperately that Lan Qiren could almost hear his exhortations as clearly as if he\u2019d spoken them. \n\u201cWhat will you do if I say no?\u201d He asked before Wei Wuxian could speak, moving to set him a cup at the table. \nHe poured tea that he knew the boy despised, wanting to see if he\u2019d drink it just to placate him. Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t even make his normal twisted overexaggerated face of disgust when he took a sip, which, admittedly, did earn him some favor. Not enough for Lan Qiren to grant his request without at least a little bit of strain, but enough that he wouldn\u2019t dismiss him out of hand. \n\u201cI\u2019d ask again,\u201d Wei Wuxian said firmly. \n\u201cAnd if I say no then?\u201d\nLan Qiren thought suddenly of Cangse Sanren. He didn\u2019t miss her, they hadn\u2019t been close enough for that, but in this moment, he was grieved that she hadn\u2019t lived to see her son like this, happy, in love, petitioning to court Lan Qiren\u2019s own nephew. He wondered if she\u2019d be amused that her son was planning on being a disturbance in the Lan Sect for the rest of his life or horrified that he\u2019d picked a fuddy-duddy Lan to be his cultivation partner.\n\u201cPardon my impertinence, master,\u201d Wei Wuxian said before bowing reverently. Lan Qiren suspected that the formality was more to hide his grin than any deference towards him. \u201cBut I am afraid that I don\u2019t quite have the strength to resist Lan Zhan if he suggests we elope to escape any permission that isn\u2019t given.\u201d\nLan Qiren didn\u2019t doubt that his stubborn nephew would steal Wei Wuxian away the moment his permission was withheld. As much as he\u2019d always hoped Wangji would be as level headed as everyone seemed to think he was, Wangji was unpredictable in the most predictable way. \nWhen Wei Wuxian looked up there was indeed a grin staining his face. \n\u201cAlso, I\u2019m certain that I love your nephew far more than you dislike me, so I\u2019m sure my persistence would overcome any stubbornness on your part.\u201d\nBefore Lan Qiren could even narrow his eyes, Wei Wuxian amended himself. \n\u201cForgive me, not stubbornness. Being unreasonably obstinate is against rule 127.\u201d His grin was still as frustrating as it was when he was a student, so when had it become endearing? \u201cMy persistence would withstand any misgivings you had about my worth as a suitor for your precious younger nephew.\u201d \nLan Qiren couldn\u2019t even protest without perjuring himself. He didn\u2019t often curse the rules, but Wei Wuxian knew how to use them exactly to his advantage. Lan Qiren didn\u2019t know whether to feel proud or exasperated. \n\u201cWell, seeing as my options are allow you to court Wangji or explain to the Elders that you have eloped, I suppose that I must, under duress,\u201d he stressed, though he was fighting a smile, \u201callow this.\u201d\nSurprisingly, Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t cheer, but he did bow respectfully, his lowered head not hiding the bright smile on his lips. \n\u201cThank you master,\u201d he said before he let out a little giggle, unable to contain himself. \nLan Qiren took a sip of his own tea.\n\u201cOf course, you know this means that you two must separate until you\u2019re married. It\u2019s improper.\u201d\nWei Wuxian laughed. \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it Uncle,\u201d he said, with that grin that made Lan Qiren wish he was in secluded meditation. \u201cI\u2019ve already deflowered Lan Zhan, so there\u2019s no more virtue to protect.\u201d\nWei Wuxian dodged the first teacup thrown his way, but not the second. \n\u201cGet out of here you scoundrel!\u201d \nWith him scrambling out the door with a giddy laugh, Lan Qiren allowed himself a smile."
