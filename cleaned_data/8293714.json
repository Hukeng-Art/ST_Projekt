    "text": "Yuuri remembers first truly realizing what the sudden appearance of symbols on the back of his hand meant sometime around the age of ten.\nHe remembers Yuuko breaking off mid-sentence to gawk down at where his left hand grips the laces of his skates, and his own eyes flick down to see odd looking characters being scrawled into existence on his skin.\n\u201cYuuri!\u201d she had gasped, eagerly grabbing for Yuuri\u2019s wrist to bring his arm to both their eye levels. (Or sort of\u2014Yuuri has to tiptoe a little to match the other girl\u2019s view of his own hand.) \u201cTakeshi! Takeshi, look! Yuuri\u2019s soulmate!\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of alien writing is that?\u201d the older boy scoffed, having lazily skated over to scowl at Yuuri\u2019s hand, and Yuuri resists the urge to pull his arm back and tuck it inside his jacket. \u201cYour soulmate\u2019s not even Japanese? Good luck finding them then.\u201d\nYuuri had tugged his arm back then, already feeling the pinprick of tears gathering at the corners of his eyes.\n\u201cTakeshi!\u201d Yuuko had snapped then, stomping her skates into the ice. \u201cThat\u2019s not very nice.\u201d She turned to Yuuri, leaning down with a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t you recognize the writing? It\u2019s Russian. Russian. Remember where we\u2019ve seen those kinds of symbols before?\u201d\nYuuri remembers perking up, eyes widening at the realization. \u201cT-the banners! The ones on TV, the ones behind Viktor\u2014\u201c\n\u201cWhat if Viktor is your soulmate?\u201d Yuuko shrieks then, and Yuuri has never remembered another moment afterwards where he had been more elated and hopeful than he had been just then.\nOf course, it was crushed when Nishigori snorted moments later, \u201cchances of that happening are next to none.\u201d\nYuuko smacks him, and Yuuri turns away, tamping down his hope. Of course that wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nStill, that day had left Yuuri hyperaware of the writing on his hand ever since. Sure, he\u2019d noticed it all throughout his youth\u2014smudges of colored markers or crayons popping up on his hands when he hadn\u2019t even been coloring that day, awkward doodles popping into existence on his forearms\u2014but after that day, Yuuri understood that it was his soulmate.\nYuuri loves the idea, even if it still is something that no one has been able to figure out. But it had been something that existed many, many years before, and it was such a small thing that no one ever completely questioned its existence. In fact, being able to write out messages to your soulmate on your skin made it incredibly easy to meet\u2026 as long as you knew the language. \nYuuri buys books on the basics of Russian, and struggles to comprehend where to even begin.\nHe hasn\u2019t even tried to reciprocate. Writing a message in Japanese was a no go since his soulmate was obviously Russian, but Yuuri had thought to try and draw a small doodle on his skin, just to let the other person know that he was there. But whenever Yuuri tries to touch pen to skin, he falters and decides to put it aside for next time. \nAnd \u201cnext time\u201d isn\u2019t until well into junior high, when the buzz around soulmate messages was at its peak. With coming of age came the interest of love, and the fact that Yuuri\u2019s hands always seem to blossom with writing gets him more than his fair share of attention.\n\u201cWhat language is that?\u201d one of his classmates asks him, her eyes wide. \u201cWow\u2026 is he writing an essay on your arm, or something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Russian, and I\u2026 I think it\u2019s a list,\u201d Yuuri says sheepishly, his own eyes following the never ending scrawl of Russian pouring from his palm and down his wrist. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what of though.\u201d He frowns when one sentence is harshly scrubbed off, another few words settling into its place. \u2018Four\u2019, Yuuri thinks he recognizes from one of his books. Four of what?\nThe day when Yuuri finally writes on his skin comes in the middle of winter, one of those days where he\u2019s too tired and cold to care about the drone of the teacher, and wishing he was skating.\nYuuri idly watches the snow fall outside when a flash of movement catches his eye. With a start, he realizes his soulmate is writing something else\u2014not a list, but a long, solid black line down the back of their hand. And another. And another\u2014\nYuuri lets out an audible snort when he realizes that his soulmate has drawn a tic-tac-toe board. \nThe teacher clears his throat, and Yuuri blushes, pretending to focus until the class resumes as if it hadn\u2019t been disturbed. Only then do his eyes dart back down to his left hand, and Yuuri feels the beginnings of a smile when he sees that his soulmate has already drawn a bold X in one of the squares. \nYuuri pauses in reaching for a pen. Is he ready? Does he want to finally make contact with his soulmate?\nAlmost as if in response to his thoughts, his soulmate bolds the X, drawing it out with thicker lines and making their impatience clear. Yuuri smiles then, and lets his pen touch the back of his hand quickly enough to draw a crude looking circle in the center of the board. \nHis soulmate\u2019s response is almost immediate. Instead of another X, Yuuri\u2019s entire hand begins to fill with little hearts circling the game, and Yuuri feels his ears begin to burn. Immediately after that, he feels terrible\u2014it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever made contact with his soulmate after years of having the other write and write, and now Yuuri\u2019s sure he\u2019d made the other person think they didn\u2019t have a soulmate to begin with.\nThe hearts finally stop when Yuuri\u2019s hand seems covered with black ink, and another X pops up adjacent to his circle. Before he can chicken out, Yuuri draws in his next move, replacing his circle with a heart. There\u2019s a long pause in which Yuuri thinks his actual heart is going to fall out of his ears or something, when the entire game is suddenly and violently scrubbed out, black ink smearing into grey smudges until his hand resembles something close to clean. Yuuri\u2019s eyes widen in dismay. Did I\u2026 Did I scare them off?\nEven as soon as he\u2019s thought it, Russian words are being scrawled into the back of his hand, a heart following soon after. Yuuri frowns unhappily, and tentatively writes back in his own language. I don\u2019t understand.\n!!!!!!!, says his soulmate.\nYuuri laughs quietly through his nose as his soulmate draws out a small flag of Japan with a question mark following it, and Yuuri bites his lip before doodling an ugly looking thumbs up.\nThere\u2019s a tiny pause before even more Russian appears, followed with another heart. And another. \nYuuri ends up not replying because, hey, he doesn\u2019t even know what that says. But for the rest of the class period, he watches as tiny hearts periodically pop up on his hand.\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nThe rest of junior high and high school goes from days of classes, to skating, to admiring Viktor onscreen, to watching his soulmate write out lists and, when a heart was included, little messages to Yuuri himself. \nHe takes pictures of all of them, of course, but with school and skating, Yuuri finds nearly no time to learn Russian, or even try to translate just one of the little messages he gets.\nHigh school ends up being a rocky time for him as well. The pressures of a future in figure skating have Yuuri alternating between eating his heart out from stress, to working his butt off to get back into shape. The messages from his soulmate become a little rarer, even if he does wake up sometimes to doodles and to the one or two messages he\u2019s finally found time to figure out. Good morning, Yuuri sees some afternoons, and good night when he wakes up for a run at six in the morning. \nAnd one day, Yuuri sees numbers scrawled on the back of his hand, and his heart nearly stops. A phone number.\nIs it his? Yuuri thinks wildly. Is it\u2026 is it someone else\u2019s?\nHis worries are assuaged when his soulmate underlines the phone number twice, a doodle of a phone and a heart appearing next to it. \nAnd now Yuuri is confused. How were they supposed to chat if they couldn\u2019t even understand each other?\nYuuri curses himself as a coward, but lets the number sit on his hand until the water of his hot springs bath that evening washes the ink away. The next morning, Yuuri wakes up to a sad face scrawled into his palm, and his ears burn with shame. The next feeling he gets is shock as, that afternoon, his soulmate uncertainly draws out shy? in uncertain looking characters, as if copied straight from a dictionary.\nEven though it\u2019s the middle of class again, Yuuri tugs out his Russian dictionary and frantically scours through the pages until he finds what he\u2019s looking for. Yes, he writes back in uneven Russian characters, feeling a slight blush warm his cheeks. Sorry.\nOK, his soulmate replies, and encircles it with a heart to let Yuuri know everything is fine.\nAnd Yuuri can\u2019t help it when he knocks his book to the floor, where it loudly smacks the ground of the classroom, when his soulmate writes out slowly, love you!\nThe teacher scolds him, but Yuuri is too shocked to care. \n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \nYuuri has just cried in a bathroom stall, got his ass verbally handed to him by a fifteen year old, and locked eyes with his idol, only to ignore his offer of a picture in favor of turning on his heel and basically running away.\nThe next year is spent in both a mental and physical struggle. He turns twenty-three and finds himself at home, wondering what to do next.\nYuuri is twenty-three, and hasn\u2019t even considered meeting his soulmate yet.\nThose years spend in college and training in Detroit had been peppered with little messages from his soulmate here and there, but even with Yuuri replying with greetings, those messages had still appeared with far more gaps between them than he liked. His soulmate was busy\u2014 as was Yuuri. But that still didn\u2019t help him feel better when he\u2019d been struggling with training, or competition losses.\nMy name is Yuuri Katsuki, Yuuri desperately wants to write. I\u2019m twenty-three, I\u2019m a figure skater (was a figure skater?), and I live in Japan, but I was in Detroit for a few years. I\u2019m trying to decide what to do next, but right now I know that I really, really, want to get to know you. But\u2026\nWell. Not that he even knew enough Russian to eloquently write even half of that out. \nYuuri slumps against his bed, hesitates, and draws out a little heart. Next to it he writes in Russian, Good afternoon.\nIt takes a minute or two, but Yuuri gets a reply in the form of another few hearts drawn under his message, a smiley face following soon after. \nGood morning, in Russian follows that, and his soulmate draws the number 9 and a sun next to it. Then they draw a sleepy faced emoticon, and Yuuri chuckles. \nYuuri freezes when his soulmates slowly begins to write again, and Yuuri can tell they\u2019re about to write something down in Japanese. \u201cWill\u2026 you\u2026 meet\u2026 me?\u201d Yuuri reads into the quiet stillness of his room, and he tucks his hands against his chest, face beginning to burn. Yuuri squeezes his eyes as he feels the usual nerves and uncertainty crawl up his throat, and he presses his arms against his midriff, never more aware of his weight than he was just then. \nI want to, Yuuri thinks, I want to\u2026 I want to, but not yet! I\u2019m not ready!\nNo, he scrawls out in squiggly English, and Yuuri leaps up to grab his skates and gloves from where they sit at his desk. He tugs the gloves on in an attempt to ignore any more writing on his hands as well, and resolutely heads out the hot springs in the direction of the Ice Castle. \nYuuri has always used skating as a means to take his mind off of his worries. And right now, he had something to show Yuuko anyway\u2014no better time than the present. \n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nHours later finds Viktor Nikiforov sprawled out on his couch, desolately clutching Makkachin to him as his eyes burn holes into the words on the back of his hand.\n\u201c\u2018No\u2019\u201d, Viktor reads, drawing out the english word into the silence, letting it grate on his ears. \u201c\u2019No\u2019\u201d.\nHis hand comes up to rest against his eyes as he tilts his head back, the picture of misery. \u201cHey, Makkachin,\u201d Viktor says, leaning back up to squeeze his poodle\u2019s adorable face, \u201cthe love of my life, the person I\u2019m meant to be with\u2014they don\u2019t want to meet me!\u201d \nMakkachin lets out a tiny whine, and Viktor sighs in agreement.\n\u201cMe! Not want to meet me? If they knew who I was, I\u2019m sure that would change their mind!\u201d Viktor squeezes the dog even closer, and Makkachin lets out another happy whine, tail wagging furiously. \u201cYou\u2019re right! I just\u2026 I just have to find a way to convince them that I\u2019m me. You\u2019re a genius, Makkachin!\u201d\nThe dog barks before pulling away to settle around Viktor\u2019s waist, promptly going to sleep.\n\u201cMy soulmate\u2026 doesn\u2019t want to meet me,\u201d Viktor repeats solemnly, and his eye twitches in an uncharacteristic show of anxiety. \u201cHow will I find my inspiration then?\u201d\nViktor\u2019s phone chimes, and he tugs it out, fully expecting a text. Instead, its a notification from Yakov, having shared a video privately through Viktor\u2019s social media. The thumbnail is a small dark haired (and slightly chubby) figure on the ice of a skating rink, mid spin. \nAnd the second that the video finishes playing, Viktor knows what he wants to do for his next move.\n\u201cMakkachin,\u201d he says softly, gently rubbing the dog\u2019s ears. \u201cWe\u2019re going on a trip!\u201d\nA dream. This had to be a dream.\n\u201cMy, my, Vicchan, your Japanese is so good!\u201d\n\u201cOh, thank you! I\u2019ve been trying to teach myself, because\u2026 ah, well, there\u2019s no such thing as knowing too many languages, you see! Unfortunately, I\u2019m terrible at writing it\u2026 so I\u2019m afraid I still have quite a lot to learn!\u201d\n\u201cBut still, how talented!\u201d Yuuri\u2019s mother gushes, and her son lets out a confused wheeze from underneath one of Viktor\u2019s luggages. How was his mother handling all of this so well? \u201cNow if you need anything else, Vicchan, just let Yuuri know! We\u2019ll take good care of you!\u201d\n\u201cSuch hospitality!\u201d Viktor replies, his voice lilted and playful as he waves Yuuri\u2019s cheerful mother out the bedroom door. \u201cHave a wonderful night!\u201d\nYuuri sets down the last of Viktor\u2019s (very heavy) boxes, groaning in relief as he stretches out his back. Working with weights has never been one of his strong points, a fact that he now sorely regrets. Next to him, Viktor leans back on his hands as he beams up at Yuuri with his own makeshift brand of warm sunlight. \nSeriously, Yuuri thinks, how can anyone be so charismatic?\n\u201cYuuri, thank you so much! Who needs a moving company when I have you, no?\u201d Viktor pats Makkachin\u2019s head as he stands, silver hair bouncing as he turns to take in his room. \u201cA little quaint isn\u2019t it? How rustic! I love it!\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 thank you,\u201d Yuuri says, still feeling unsteady on his feet. What in the world was he supposed to say to his idol? \u201cI\u2026 are you really going to be my coach?\u201d\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Viktor gracefully turns on his heel to face him, taking the two steps necessary to plant himself inside of Yuuri\u2019s personal bubble. \u201cI\u2019m going to take you to victory, Yuuri! After you win is when I\u2019ll bill you the coach\u2019s fee, so no worries.\u201d The older man airily waves a hand in the air. Suddenly, Viktor\u2019s gaze sharpens, and Yuuri has to resist the urge to step back when their eyes meet. \n\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor croons, a hand coming up to cup Yuuri\u2019s chin. \u201cThere\u2019s so much I need to know about you before we even get started. What are your likes? Your dislikes?\u201d \nYuuri trembles when he feels Viktor\u2019s other hand gently tug at his left arm before slowly snaking down to entwine with Yuuri\u2019s fingers. \u201cWhat is there to see in this city? And\u2026\u201d\nYuuri gulps audibly as Viktor grabs his hand and squeezes, internally marveling at how soft Viktor\u2019s palm was. \n\u201cDo you have a soulmate?\u201d Viktor asks finally, eyes alight with curiosity.\nAs if he\u2019d been doused with a bucket of cold water, Yuuri regains his senses and scrambles back and away from Viktor, back slamming into the wall behind him.\n\u201cHuh? Why\u2019d you run away?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I do!\u201d Yuuri yelps, face bright red. \u201cI have one! A soulmate!\u201d\n\u201cOh? Marvelous! As do I!\u201d Viktor says excitedly. \u201cLet\u2019s stay up and bond together over true love! What better way to get to know each other?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s better if we sleep,\u201d Yuuri splutters, hands waving. \u201cBecause\u2026 I want to wake up early if I\u2019m going to get back into training, so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGood point,\u201d Viktor says in English, propping his chin up with one hand. \u201cIn that case, we can just sleep together!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 excuse me?\u201d\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nYuuri\u2019s week had just gone from bad, to worse, to absolutely, incredibly amazing.\nViktor Nikiforov had burst into his life like an overly happy snowstorm, literally bared himself to Yuuri with nothing but the steam to mask him as he declared he was to be Yuuri\u2019s coach, stuffed himself with food and sake, called Yuuri a \u201clittle piggy\u201d, then promptly demanded that they sleep together. \nOkay, so Yuuri admits that last part was the most weird out of all of Viktor\u2019s shenanigans (actually, maybe a little less weird than the onsen incident), and he clutches his left hand to his chest even as he barricades the door against Viktor\u2019s insistent knocking. I have a soulmate. I have a soulmate. Viktor Nikiforov is standing right outside my door, in the flesh, but I have a soulmate, and I must! Stay loyal! \nEven so, the fact that the idol of his youth and young adulthood was in his house, wanting to coach him\u2026 Yuuri admits to himself that he can\u2019t help but feel as if he was in a dream.\n\u201cWe have to bond!\u201d Viktor cries, rapping on the wood with sharp knuckles. \u201cHow will I know what you look like when you dream if you don\u2019t let me sleep next to you?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know that!\u201d Yuuri screeches hysterically, eyes wide as he looks around his room with fresh eyes. Young Viktor and Makkachin posted next to his desk, an extra large poster of Viktor with long hair, a framed photo of Viktor\u2014\nThere was no way his idol was getting anywhere past the doorway. \nViktor Nikiforov lets out a sad little sigh that\u2019s echoed by a small whimper from Makkachin, and Yuuri\u2019s shoulders slump in relief when he hears footsteps retreating back down the hallway. \nOnly then does Yuuri relax and allow himself to step away from the door to begin the arduous task of carefully taking down every single picture and poster he\u2019d collected over the years. Yuuri allows himself one sigh of regret\u2014it really is a shame, but there was absolutely no way he was going let Viktor see just how far his fanboy tendencies could actually go. \nThinking of Viktor reminds Yuuri of another pressing matter.\n\nI have one! A soulmate!\n\n\nOh? As do I!\n\n\u201cI wonder what his soulmate is like?\u201d Yuuri murmurs, tucking his legs against his chest. He bites his lip as he reaches up to grab a pen from his desk, hesitating for one moment before writing out a tentative I\u2019m sorry on the back of his hand. It\u2019s been days since he\u2019d last heard from his soulmate\u2014they hadn\u2019t replied after Yuuri\u2019s abrupt rejection, and not for the first time Yuuri wishes he had the means to express his exact feelings to the other person. \nRather than dwell on waiting, Yuuri stands to prepare for bed, and pauses when he hears footsteps thundering around the floor above him.\n\u201cRuchka!!\u201d Yuuri thinks he hears Viktor shriek, and he wonders concernedly if his coach (his coach!) is alright. \nIt goes quiet moments later, and Yuuri shrugs and opts to continue heading to the restroom to brush his teeth. It\u2019s when he\u2019s washing his face that, in the mirror, he sees black ink appearing on the back of his left hand. Yuuri quickly rinses and dries his face, grabbing for his glasses as he races back to his room.\nSad, his soulmate writes in stilted Japanese. But understand. Meet someday?\nYuuri feels tears pinprick at his eyes, and he blinks furiously to better see and write out his own reply.\nYes! he writes in Russian. And because he doesn\u2019t know the word in Russian, he copies back someday clearly in his own language. \nShaky looking hearts begin to fill the back of his hand, and Yuuri presses it against a watery smile. \nA floor above him, Viktor Nikiforov presses the back of his left hand against his lips as he leans back against the ruthlessly opened cardboard box he\u2019d mauled in order to get a single ballpoint pen.\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nViktor tilts his head back as he inhales the crisp morning air, looking far too pleased as Yuuri wheezes away with step ups on the bench next to him. \n\u201cNothing like a good morning work out, I\u2019d say,\u201d Viktor declares. Yuuri attempts to huff out a sound of agreement without making it seem like he was dying. \n\u201cYou never answered me, you know,\u201d Viktor continues, and Yuuri takes that as permission to finally stop. He\u2019d lost count somewhere after fifty\u2014his entire lower half was sure to be sore the next day. \n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\u201cAbout\u2026 well, I never asked straight out, did I? I wanted to know about your soulmate!\u201d\n\u201cM-my soul\u2014\u201c Yuuri yelps loudly as he almost topples off the bench, and scrambles to right himself before he face plants in front of his idol. He takes a moment to carefully step down and seat himself next to Viktor, fanning himself with the front of his shirt. \u201cI mean\u2026 there isn\u2019t much to say.\u201d\n\u201cWell, as for me,\u201d Viktor intercedes, preening. \u201cMy soulmate and I communicate more through feelings than words, you know. We haven\u2019t met face-to-face just yet, but I already love them more than my heart can handle!\u201d\n\u201cW-wow,\u201d Yuuri says, simultaneously amazed and wistful. \u201cThat\u2019s incredible.\u201d \n\u201cIsn\u2019t it? I think the mystery gives it even more appeal.\u201d\nYuuri pauses, hesitant. \u201cBut why haven\u2019t you met them yet? If it\u2019s alright to ask.\u201d\n\u201cOf course! Well\u2026\u201d Viktor stops, his normally cordial features smoothing into something pensive as he looks across the treetops in front of them. \u201cThey aren\u2019t ready, and it isn\u2019t my place to push them. Well\u2014to not push too much.\u201d Viktor suddenly turns sheepish, and Yuuri cocks his head to the side curiously. \u201cI do hope to see them very soon, though. I mean, I don\u2019t know where they are, exactly, but I do know that they live h\u2014\u201c\nMakkachin lets out a series of hearty barks, and both men turn to see the poodle excitedly engaging a bird perched in a tree. \n\u201cMakkachin!\u201d Viktor scolds lightheartedly, \u201cleave the poor thing alone!\u201d He pauses then as his eyes catch the rooftop of the castle looming above them, and his lips purse. \u201cYuuri, what is that?\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Yuuri\u2019s eyes light up, and his mouth turns upwards in a smile. \u201cThat is a ninja house!\u201d\n\u201cNinja!\u201d Viktor echoes excitedly, already standing to leave. \u201cWow!\u201d\nYuuri\u2019s smile grows larger when he snaps a picture of Viktor and Makkachin in front of the castle, silently thinking that who ever Viktor\u2019s soulmate was, was pretty lucky indeed.\nBut also, Yuuri amends, right to be nervous to meet someone as talented as Viktor Nikiforov. \n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nThe arrival of Yuri Plisetsky is another storm upon Yuuri\u2019s life, only this one is significantly less friendly and ten times as destructive. How could someone so small be such a threat to everything Yuuri has looked forward to in the past week?\n\u201cFood! And a bath!\u201d the fifteen year old demands, and Yuuri\u2019s eyes nearly roll out of his head. \u201cI saw that!\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d says Yuuri placatingly, raising his hands in a show of non-aggression. \u201cJust let me show you the bath house, and you can head over there right after dinner\u2014\u201c\n\u201cLike I said, I don\u2019t want to bathe with other people,\u201d interrupts Yuri scathingly. \u201cI want to take a bath by myself.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Yuuri finally says, a patronizing smile pasted onto his face. \u201cJust let me feed you first.\u201d\n\u201cThe pork cutlet bowls here are delicious, Yurio,\u201d Viktor chimes in, and Yuri splutters indignantly. \n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that. What a ridiculous nickname to give to someone you just met, this family is crazy\u2014and you! Give me two bowls.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Yuuri repeats, heading out the door to let his mother know of their newest arrival.\n\u201cDon\u2019t call them crazy.\u201d Viktor\u2019s airy voice follows Yuuri as he walks into the hallway. \u201cThey\u2019re very nice. And they make delicious food.\u201d\n\u201cHmph. I can\u2019t wait till we\u2019re back in Russia.\u201d\n\u201cNow if you want that, you\u2019re going to have to work hard to win the Hot Springs On Ice, Yurio!\u201d Viktor says cheerfully, and Yuuri clenches his fists against the sudden onslaught of anxiety.\nViktor? Leaving?\n\nI\u2019m going to take you to victory, Yuuri!\n\nYuuri catches Yuri\u2019s faint, \u201cI said don\u2019t call me that!\u201d as he darts out the inn\u2019s front door, shoes on and skating gear tucked safely into his backpack. \n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nSkating has always been Yuuri\u2019s escape. \nThe ice rink was his sanctuary, even as much as it was the cause for his anxiety. The competitions, the pressure, the stress of getting a routine right and being in shape for a season\u2014\nBut when it came down to it, figure skating was his one true love. \nBeing granted access to Ice Castle Hasetsu was one blessing Yuuri had always cherished, relishing in the soft hiss of blades against ice, and the sharp click of a successful landing.\nYuuri exhales as he turns in a slow circle, letting his arms float in the cool air. When he wasn\u2019t practicing for an upcoming competition, Yuuri liked to let his body move naturally, giving himself time to just let go and think.\nUnsurprisingly, the first things that came to mind were the Hot Springs on Ice, Viktor, and his soulmate. \nWait\u2014 Yuuri startles, and his skates wobble for a precarious second. Soulmate first. I was thinking of them first. They\u2019re important.\nFeeling oddly chastised, Yuuri attempts to regain his composure, leaning forward into an easy two-foot glide that takes him from one side of the rink to the other. \nWhat am I thinking? Yuuri lets out a nervous breath. Of course they\u2019re important, but first things, first\u2014I have to win the Hot Springs on Ice competition if I want Viktor\u2014\nAnd there he breaks off again, losing balance. Frustrated, Yuuri grabs for the edge of the rink, letting his body sink against the barrier. \nWhat is\u2026 am I feeling guilty? Yuuri shakes his head furiously, pressing a hand against his forehead to wipe away the sweat that had begun to appear despite the cool temperature of the rink. Viktor is my idol. Of course I\u2019d be happy that he\u2019s here. Of course I wouldn\u2019t want him to leave. This is a chance I\u2019ve waited for, for my entire life.\nStill, that doesn\u2019t seem to help dispel the sudden guilt weighing on his chest, and Yuuri turns to other thoughts. Eros. Eros. This would have been so much easier if I\u2019d been given Agape. Yuuri groans internally as he pushes away from the edge of the rink, letting himself slide aimlessly along the ice. A sexual love? I haven\u2019t even had puppy love. I haven\u2019t even had love-love! \nNow feeling distinctly childish, Yuuri rakes his gloved hands through his hair until it sticks up in different directions. Eros. Eh-roh-s\u2026 He closes his eyes, thinking of an invisible hand drawing out a tic-tac-toe board. Writing out dozens of hearts against skin. A mouth moving in greeting, a soundless Good morning, good evening. Shy?\nYuuri imagines those hands in his, stretching his own in front of him as he glides forward, imagining warmth enclosed in his palms. \nThe hands in his imagination move upwards, and one of them comes up to cup his chin, and suddenly Yuuri is looking into the eyes of Viktor Nikiforov.\nYuuri shudders, guilt coming back full force. Still, he allows his imagination to continue, feeling Viktor\u2019s touch as real as the rest of his surroundings. His eyes fall to half mast as he presses his hands against his chest, letting them slide down until they float away at his sides, balancing him in a slow, backward one-foot glide. The Viktor of his imagination tugs him forward, and Yuuri complies, spinning back around until he skates forward on one foot, arms outstretched to reach for his partner. \nViktor smiles with plush lips and motions for Yuuri to turn. Yuuri lets out a small sigh as he picks up speed, taking himself around the rink.He can feel himself gaining momentum, pushing onward until he lifts off into an elated triple flip, another echo of Viktor\u2019s skating. \nYuuri\u2019s eyes slide nearly shut once again, letting the colors of the rink blur and melt into one as he falls into a smooth combination spin. He\u2019s warm\u2014he can almost imagine arms wrapped around himself, a lilted voice in his ear, the bright eyes of Viktor staring at him from the edge of the rink\u2014\nYuuri\u2019s eyes fly open to meet Viktor\u2019s for a good half second before he loses control of his spin and falls flat onto his butt with a startled yelp.\n\u201cYuuri!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine! I\u2019m fine!\u201d Yuuri gasps, ears burning from embarrassment for more than one reason. \u201cWhat\u2014what are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cWell, older Katsuki sister said that you\u2019re either here or at \u2018Minako\u2019s place\u2019\u2014very cryptic wording I might add, I was surprised she meant a ballet studio\u2014and here you are!\u201d Viktor leans against the rink\u2019s barrier, eyes never leaving Yuuri\u2019s. \u201cAlready practicing your Eros personality? I haven\u2019t even finished the choreo, you know. But I applaud your enthusiasm.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that was just\u2026\u201d Yuuri trails off helplessly, finally turning his head away as he scrambles upright. He\u2019s never felt this unsteady on the ice before. \n\u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d Viktor interjects softly, and Yuuri perks up, \u201cif not a little rough. But that\u2019s to be expected. Who were you thinking of?\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2014?\u201d Yuuri feels as if he\u2019s choking on air, and he presses his hands against his stomach nervously. Viktor\u2019s smiling face flashes in his mind, and he faces the real one, flustered. \u201cI\u2026 my soulmate. I was thinking about my soulmate.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Viktor\u2019s face smooths out into uncharacteristic blankness for a second so fast that Yuuri thinks he could have imagined it. Then the charismatic TV smile is back full force, and Yuuri feels like he has to blink against sunlight. \u201cWell, I have to say, I\u2019m a little jealous! Who wouldn\u2019t be, after seeing how much love you were exuding? They are very lucky.\u201d Viktor pauses again, and this time Yuuri is almost sure he can see the hesitation on Viktor\u2019s face. \u201cBut not as lucky as mine! I have an overflowing spring of love for my darling!\u201d\n\u201cI can tell,\u201d Yuuri says, a hesitant smile on his lips, and Viktor beams back for an uncomfortably long second before the older man finally turns away, waving for Yuuri to follow him. \n\u201cIt was a beautiful atmosphere, Yuuri,\u201d Viktor says lowly, and Yuuri wishes he hadn\u2019t turned so he could see Viktor\u2019s face. \u201cBut still!\u201d And finally his would-be coach whips around to smile devilishly at the darker haired man. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing Agape, so that kind of lovesick look on your face tonight won\u2019t cut it for you in the upcoming week!\u201d\n\u201cViktor!\u201d Yuuri protests, feeling his ears burn. Lovesick?\n\u201cAlso, it\u2019s time for former-little-piggy to come hoo-oome,\u201d Viktor sing-songs, tapping his foot impatiently as he walks backwards towards the Ice Castle\u2019s entrance. \u201cYou\u2019re not skating tomorrow, but even while I\u2019m choreographing, I\u2019m expecting a great and many sit-ups to be done! Come, Yuuri!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a dog,\u201d Yuuri replies half-heartedly as he skates over to the rink\u2019s entrance. He blushes when Viktor smiles at him, and hastily sits down to tug his skates off. \nI have a soulmate, Yuuri thinks for the nth time. And we\u2019re meant to be together. As soon as we meet.\nYuuri glances up to see Viktor staring at him pensively. When the older man sees he\u2019s been caught, Viktor turns on his high beams again, waving at Yuuri to hurry with a cheerful grin on his face. \nYuuri blushes and ducks his head down. \n\u2026as soon as we meet.\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \nIt is exactly midnight, and Yuuri Katsuki is most definitely not sleeping in preparation for the long day of training ahead. \nHis lone desk lamp shines in the gloom of his room, giving enough like for him to see both his hands. And a pen. \nI want to see you. Yuuri grits his teeth and uncaps his pen.  \u2018I\u2026 want\u2026 to\u2026 meet\u2026 you.\u2019 Come on, Yuuri! Just write it!\nYuuri exhales shakily, thumbing through his Russian dictionary for the thousandth time. But just as he finally lifts his pen, a dark line appears on the back of his hand. \nHe gasps, nearly dropping the pen and dictionary down the side of his bed as he leans forward to watch the formation of characters against skin. \nIn Japan for business. A long pause in which Yuuri feels like his heart might combust. His soulmate was here? In Japan? Ask one time. OK if \u2018no\u2019\u2026 And then the invisible pen speeds up as if they had practiced this one line carefully, over and over until it came out almost perfect. Will you meet me? \nRidiculously enough, Yuuri feels tears gathering at his eyes again, and he hardly hesitates when he pens down a quick yes! \nYuuri feels goosebumps crawl up his arms when, after another moments hesitation, his soulmate begins to write again. Instead of a bunch of frivolous hearts, or a written exclamation, his soulmate pens out a single, heartfelt phrase. \n\nI\u2019m so happy.\n\nYuuri slumps over his breakfast, blearily blinking his eyes and not even noticing that he\u2019s unconsciously decided to use his chopsticks as a makeshift pillow. \nAcross from him, Viktor heartily inhales his food in enthusiastic gulps, seemingly energetic even as his distressingly dark eye bags cast deep shadows on his face.\nYuri glares between them both, utterly perplexed.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with the both of you?\u201d His face twists. \u201cDid you do extra practice without me?\u201d\nYuuri sits up immediately, arms flailing, failing to notice how his chopsticks have stuck into the deep indents on his face from laying on them for so long. \u201cWe didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Yuri says, appeased. \u201cThen why are you both dead?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Viktor interjects, waving his own chopsticks in the air with gusto. \u201cI have never felt more alive! Come now, eat more of your vegetables! We have quite the practice today, I\u2019ve put the finishing touches on the choreography, and they\u2019re ready for you to learn them!\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not tired, then what,\u201d Yuri says flatly, \u201care those under your eyes?\u201d And he jabs at his own eyes, finger coming precariously close to gouging one out. \n\u201cA man\u2019s resolve.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s understandable if Viktor was staying up to finish the choreography\u2026 as for me, I just wasn\u2019t able to sleep,\u201d Yuuri finally interrupts, thankfully cutting short a trademark Yurio temper tantrum. \u201cI was\u2026 trying to think about eros.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean your ideal bowl of pork?\u201d Yuri says slyly, resting his chin against his palm. \u201cThat\u2019s your idea of seductive, right?\u201d\nYuuri blushes, wide awake. \u201cI just said that because\u2014I mean\u2014\u201c He lets out a startled yelp when the utensils unstick from his face and clatter loudly onto table. \u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIdiot\u2026\u201d Yuri mutters, reaching over him to reset the chopsticks back to their rightful place. \u201cYou think too much.\u201d \n\u201cI for one,\u201d Viktor cuts in, again, voice loud and cheerful in the tiny room, \u201chave some wonderful, amazing news!\u201d\nBoth Yuris lean forward expectantly, immediately serious. \nA deep breath in. \u201cBut I\u2019m not telling you!\u201d\nYuuri slumps back as Yurio growls frustratedly, slapping the table with an angry palm. \u201cJeez, Viktor, I thought it was going to be something about our programs!\u201d\nViktor laughs airily. \u201cSorry~\u201d\nAll at once, Viktor turns sober, his eyes flicking to Yuuri for a second too long, and Yuri tenses. Suspicious\u2026 \n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you after it happens,\u201d Viktor says suddenly, and he receives a curious lift of the brow from two sides. \u201cBut for now\u2026 all you\u2019ve got to do is focus on the upcoming week!\u201d\n\u201cIf it isn\u2019t about the competition, I guess it can wait,\u201d Yuri replies, already beginning to shrug it off. He lifts another bite to his mouth, ready to dig in, until something dark catches his eye.\n\u201cOi, Viktor,\u201d Yuri mumbles through his mouthful, and Viktor turns his one hundred watt smile towards the boy. \u201cI get that you want to keep keepsakes, or something, but leaving ink on your hand for long isn\u2019t very hygienic. Gross.\u201d\nAt this, Yuuri seems to perk up, craning his neck to peer around the table. But Viktor\u2019s left hand rests on the floor closest to Yurio, hidden by both the table corner and Yuri\u2019s leg, and Yuuri leans back, looking disappointed. Yuri cocks an eyebrow at him, confused.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Viktor says, for once sounding completely off guard. \u201cI\u2026 I hadn\u2019t realized. Let me just make sure I have this information down before I wash it off!\u201d And their would-be coach smoothly lifts himself off the ground, left hand tucked too closely to his side to be natural. \nThis time, Yuri doesn\u2019t miss the disappointed sigh that comes from Yuri #2, and the teenager turns to assess him. \u201cHuh? What\u2019s with you?\u201d\nYuuri freezes, eyes blinking wide. \u201cNothing! I was just hoping\u2026 maybe to, I don\u2019t know, learn more about Viktor\u2019s soulmate?\u201d Yuuri turns even redder under the other\u2019s scrutinizing gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to pry. He just speaks about them so much, so I was just curious\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d Yuri turns back to his meal, fully intent on scarfing it down as fast as possible. He needs the fuel if he wants to win, after all. \u201cThere isn\u2019t much to say. They\u2019ve been in contact for as long as I\u2019ve known Viktor, and even then I haven\u2019t learned much about them. Viktor rarely ever shows anyone else what his soulmate writes. I'd do the same, actually.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Yuuri says, nervously tugging at his fingers. The agitated movement draws Yuri\u2019s eyes, and he turns his head slightly to glance.\n\u201cWh\u2014\u201c The second that his eyes fall on Yuuri\u2019s hand, Yuri violently inhales the large serving of rice in his mouth, sending it careening down the wrong way. \n\u201cYurio!\u201d Yuuri gasps, worriedly thumping at Yuri\u2019s back. \u201cCough it out, you\u2019ll choke!\u201d\nNever to be one to quit, Yuri snatches at a glass of water and gulps it down in record time, eyes watering against the dense packing of rice in his throat until his airways are finally clear. \u201cDamn it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYurio, wait, drink some more water\u2014\u201c\n\u201cShow me your hand!\u201d Yuri demands, already grabbing for Yuuri. The man flinches but allows his arm to be manhandled to Yuri\u2019s eye level, face quickly turning another level of flushed.\nAnd Yuri stares blankly for a few seconds at the bits and pieces of scattered Russian and Japanese words in two different styles of handwriting and in a perfect copy of what he\u2019s sure he\u2019d seen on Viktor\u2019s hand, before the ink suddenly and unceremoniously blurs into smears. Yuri gapes as the words are wiped off before his very eyes, and beside him, Yuuri lets out a tiny sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I thought to take a photo before breakfast,\u201d he murmurs, almost to himself, and Yurio\u2019s head turns at an infinitesimally slow pace to regard his rival. \u201cI didn\u2019t think they\u2019d wash it off so soon.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014your soul\u2014\u201c\n \u201cYuuri!\u201d a light voice calls out, and his mother bustles into the room to regard both Yuris with fondness. \u201cGood morning, Yurio! Yuuri, I need your help! The main kitchen\u2019s faucet just won\u2019t work again, and your father and sister aren\u2019t home to help me fix it!\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Yuuri says good-naturedly, and his arm easily slips out of a petrified Yurio\u2019s grasp. \u201cYurio, you\u2019re practicing Agape with Viktor first, right? I don\u2019t know how long this will take, but can you tell Viktor I\u2019ll meet you both at the Ice Castle?\u201d\n\u201cHblurbgah,\u201d Yurio replies, grains of rice toppling down from his lower lip, and Yuuri frowns. Yuri ends up having to fight Yuuri and his disgusting tissue away, pointing the other man to the door imperiously. \u201cJust. Leave.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Yuuri concedes, hands raised, and really, Yuri can\u2019t figure out why he does that so often. His rival is out the door before Yuri can even form another sentence, and he struggles to form coherent thought through the confused white noise in his brain. \n\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d Viktor sings, cascading through the doorway, and Yuri sets blazing eyes on the older man. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe run to the Ice Castle is a blur, with Yuri only faintly registering Viktor\u2019s cries of \u201cwow, Yurio, how fast! We didn\u2019t even wait for Yuuri! Ah, Makkachin, no, we\u2019ll play fetch later!\u201d\nYuri all but stomps onto the ice rink, gouging deep cuts into the surface. Finally, Viktor seems to register his agitation, pausing in zipping up his jacket to regard the boy with keen eyes. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Yuri hisses, thoughts finally scrambling into place, \u201cwho is your soulmate?\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t we been over this? It\u2019s a secret!\u201d\n\u201cYes, but do you actually know?\u201d\nViktor pauses, the corners of his mouth beginning to turn down at the corners. \u201c\u2026If we\u2019re being honest here, then no. But as in Agape, one must feel the love, rather than trying to analyze\u2014\u201c\n\u201cTeach later, talk now,\u201d Yuri interrupts bluntly, and Viktor\u2019s eyebrows shoot upwards into his immaculately styled hair. \u201cHave you known this entire time? Why didn\u2019t you just tell me? If you wanted to come here to meet your soulmate, why go under the guise of being a coa\u2014\u201c\n\u201cHow did you know they were from Japan?\u201d Viktor interjects, seemingly both impressed and confused. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you actually paid attention to what the writing was! Not that I mind, of course, I always only ever go out of my way to hide my more lovelorn messages.\u201d Viktor presses a finger against a goofy smile that quickly overtakes his face. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on telling anyone anything until after I\u2019d met them face-to-face!\u201d\n\u201cOf course I would know,\u201d Yuri snaps, disregarding the fact that he hadn\u2019t realized anything until less than an hour before, \u201cit\u2019s so obvious\u2014wait. You\u2026 you think you haven\u2019t met them yet?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I haven\u2019t, it\u2019s not an \u2018I think\u2019, it\u2019s an \u2018I know\u2019!\u201d Viktor pouts dramatically. \u201cHonestly, Yurio, it\u2019s like you\u2019re rubbing salt onto the wound!\u201d\nYuri stares blankly at the man, dumbstruck. \u201cYou really, actually, don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cNo?\u201d Viktor cocks his head, beginning to look unsettled. \u201cWhy are you looking at me so funny?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know\u2026 and they don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes? I just said that?\u201d\n\u201cSo you were never planning to be impartial in judging,\u201d Yuri mutters. \u201cYou never even knew.\u201d\n\u201cYurio, you have to speak louder, I can\u2019t hear you!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me Yurio,\u201d Yuri protests automatically, mind one hundred miles away. \u201cI cannot believe this.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it either. Yurio has finally lost his mind in the pursuit of agape. That\u2019s why you wanted to hear my beautiful love story, no?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Yuri grumbles, finally coming back to his senses. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m ready to skate.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Viktor smiles at this, leaning against the rink\u2019s barrier. \u201cTruly? Glad you\u2019ve gotten whatever you needed to out of your system.\u201d\n\u201cI just want you to know\u2026\u201d Yuri turns back to stare Viktor down with hard eyes, and his would-be coach raises an eyebrow, looking completely serious for once. \u201cI\u2019m going to win, no matter what the circumstances are. There may be something \u2018there\u2019, but even if there is, I\u2019m going to make you choose through talent itself.\u201d\nViktor stares back, one eyebrow hitched. \u201c\u2026As much as I love to hear your gusto, Yurio, I have to say I\u2019m a little lost. But I hear your determination.\u201d Viktor smiles. \u201cLoud and clear.\u201d\nYuri snorts embarassedly, then tenses when Viktor frowns.\n\u201cYou seem a little too tense to encapsulate the essence of agape just yet though. Maybe\u2026 if you needed some serenity\u2026 the temple would be a good first stop for now, then?\u201d\nYuri scowls, deeply confused. \u201cTemple? What temple?\u201d\nAn hour later, Yuri deeply regrets ever even asking.\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Yuuri says when he steps into the Ice Castle, hours later. \u201cSorry, the faucet thing took up a lot more time than I thought it would.\u201d\nYuuri was perplexed at the sight of Yurio slouched on one of the rink\u2019s benches near the entrance, looking sulky as he rolled his shoulders back and forth. \u201cOh. You.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d Yuuri replies somewhat hesitantly, still unsure how to treat the other after their weird behavior during breakfast.\nYuri merely rolls his eyes, and turns his head to the side. \u201cNothing. My practice just ended\u2014which went very well, okay\u2014and Viktor said to send you inside once you got here.\u201d\n\u201cAh, got it,\u201d Yuuri says hastily, quickly stepping forward. His heart begins to race at the thought of finally learning eros under Viktor.\nUnder Viktor\u2019s tutelage. His teaching. Yuuri\u2019s ears begin to burn a warm red. Learning under Viktor in the most professional way possible, that\u2019s what he had meant\u2014\n\u201cIdiot couple,\u201d Yurio mutters, and Yuuri thinks he\u2019s heard wrong.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cNo-thing,\u201d enunciates Yuri, managing to look both furious and smug at the same time. \u201cGo away already.\u201d\nYuuri hums a confirmation, glancing back at Yurio one more time before he turns away and towards the rink.\nThe hiss of blades against the ice is crisp in the air, and Yuuri inhales slowly at the sight of Viktor gently gliding along the center.\n\u201cEros,\u201d Viktor says, his lilting voice carrying over the soft scratch of his skates as he slows to a stop, \u201cis something you must embody, Yuuri. Otherwise, how will the audience believe in your eros if you don\u2019t even believe in it yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d Yuuri promises, eyes following Viktor as he blindly fumbles for his skates. \u201cI\u2014I will become Eros!\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve said,\u201d Viktor replies, a gentle smile on his face. \u201cAnd again, I applaud your enthusiasm.\u201d He beckons Yuuri inside the rink, and Yuuri complies, blushing when they brush shoulders, with how close Viktor is standing to the rink\u2019s entrance. \u201cBut do you even know what eros is to you?\u201d\nAnd suddenly, Viktor comes even closer, bright eyes blinking inquisitively at Yuuri, who suddenly feels like all the air has been expelled from his lungs.\n\u201cI\u2014yes!\u201d Yuuri squeaks, turning bright red. \u201cPork cutlet bowls!\u201d\nViktor leans back to let out a pleased laugh, one hand coming up to rest on Yuuri\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLike I said, how unique! If that\u2019s so\u2026\u201d\nViktor leans forward again, and Yuuri finds that, for some reason, he doesn\u2019t feel like backing up and away. Viktor is close enough that Yuuri can feel warm breaths against his cheeks, and he almost stops his own breathing out of self-consciousness. \n\u201cHow will you portray the seductive pull of the pork cutlet bowl?\u201d Viktor asks, voice falling deceptively low. \u201cHow will you translate its attraction into every single movement you make?\u201d Then there\u2019s a hand cupping Yuuri\u2019s chin again, and he has to fight not to swoon forward into Viktor\u2019s grasp. \u201cIf the motion of eros and the understanding of its concept is inside of you, Yuuri, can you bring it out and show it to me?\u201d\n!!!!!!, screams Yuuri\u2019s mind.\n\u201cOi!\u201d Yurio bellows, and Yuuri flinches away from Viktor\u2019s grasp like he\u2019s been burnt. Viktor merely raises an eyebrow and leans back to rest on his heels again, crossing his arms against his chest.\n\u201cYe-es, Yurio?\u201d\n\u201cQuit flirting and start skating,\u201d Yuri demands, leaning up against the barrier and obviously planning to observe. Oddly enough, he has that conflicted look on his face again, this time a contrasting mixture of irritated and bemused. \n\u201cYurio,\u201d Viktor coos cheerfully, \u201cthis is all a part of the feeling of eros!\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s kind of weird,\u201d Yuri retorts, smirking into his hand. \u201cMr. Pork Cutlet Bowl over there hardly even looks like he\u2019s got the slightest inkling of where to begin.\u201d\nPunk, Yuuri thinks sullenly. Extremely talented Russian punk. He shakes his head in an effort to clear it, and the motion has both Yuri and Viktor turning to look at him.\n\u201cI can do it!\u201d he says, determinedly straightening his back. \u201cShow me the choreography, and I\u2019ll reflect the essence of eros into it!\u201d\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d Viktor enthuses, beaming, and Yuri merely blinks at his rival, resting a cheek against his palm. \nIt\u2019s easier said than done, of course\u2014Viktor ends up having Yuuri run through his basics for most of the practice after he falls out of one of his jumps, and Yuri snorts once before going back to staring at them both with that same weirdly keen look in his eyes. \n\u201cI think that should be enough for today,\u201d Viktor calls out after Yuuri pauses for breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to overload with too much to remember on the first day of practice.\u201d\n\u201cB-but I can do it!\u201d Yuuri protests. \u201cWe\u2019ve barely gone through the very beginning of the program\u2014\u201c\n\u201cBecause someone had to go through their basics again, no?\u201d Viktor says with another hundred watt smile, and Yuuri flushes and looks down, chastened. \nHe also finds it slightly weird that Yuri doesn\u2019t pipe up with a scathing remark of his own, but the teenager merely scowls and begins to roll his shoulders again as if stretching out sore muscle. \n\u201cBesides,\u201d Viktor continues, \u201cthere is always tomorrow.\u201d Yuuri freezes when Viktor\u2019s hand comes up to rest at the nape of his neck, fingers brushing the soft hair there. \nHe glances up at his idol to find Viktor staring back down at him, looking caught off guard as he hadn\u2019t expected himself to do that either. \u201cAh\u2026 I\u2014\u201c\nBefore Viktor can continue, Yuuri leans in a little into his touch until Viktor\u2019s hand slides even higher, tangling in Yuuri\u2019s hair as Yuuri\u2019s side brushes against Viktor\u2019s.\nAnd suddenly, both of them pause at a confused standstill.\nWhat am I doing? Yuuri thinks suddenly, unable to tear his eyes away from Viktor\u2019s. What am I doing, whatamIdoing, whatamIdoingwhatamIdoi\u2014\n\u201cOI.\u201d\nYuuri and Viktor leap apart, and Yuuri desperately tries to ignore how nice it feels to have Viktor\u2019s fingers slide through his hair as it passes through.\n\u201cYes?\u201d Viktor laughs, and Yuuri swears he imagined the nervous lilt in his voice. \u201cAre you feeling neglected too, Yurio? Come, let me give you a hug!\u201d\n\u201cThanks, but no thanks,\u201d Yuri snorts, rolling his eyes. \u201cJust hurry up so we can go home already. I\u2019m hungry!\u201d\nMakkachin barks as if to second Yuri\u2019s statement, and Viktor laughs as he bounds out of the doors with his poodle. \u201cAre you hungry too, my darling? Are you? I\u2019ll feed you the most premium of Japanese dog food immediately for being so amazing!\u201d\nYuuri watches him leave in stunned silence, slowly trying to process his actions. Did he almost\u2014\nNo. Yuuri presses a hand against his mouth, furrowing his brow. It didn\u2019t mean anything. \n\u201cYurio,\u201d Yuuri begins hesitantly, flushing bright red. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t\u2026 it wasn\u2019t any\u2014\u201c\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Yuri groans, stretching his arms above his head. \u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d \nYuuri hesitates as he watches Yurio gather his things, feeling oddly like he has to justify himself. \u201cI\u2019m meeting my soulmate the day after the Hot Springs on Ice competition!\u201d\nYuri pauses in stuffing his skates into his bag, and looks up slowly to regard Yuuri with narrowed eyes. There\u2019s a beat of silence before he shrugs.\n\u201cAfter the competition right? Then it\u2019s not my problem.\u201d Yuri shoulders his bag and looks at Yuuri with a closed off expression. \u201c\u2026But good for you. I guess. Now hurry up and get moving. I want to eat!\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright\u2014\u201c\n\u201cStop saying that!\u201d Yurio rolls his eyes as he brushes past Yuuri, and Yuuri thinks he can faintly hear him go, \u201cthis entire situation is absolutely ridiculous.\u201d\nHow odd.\n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\nThe days pass in a blur as both competitors work towards victory in Hot Springs on Ice, punctuated by Viktor\u2019s clear, commanding voice and filled with hazy hours of endurance training. \nThere comes a day that Yuuri hereby refers to as Yurio\u2019s Waterfall Revelation, and it only works to strengthen his determination to capture the meaning of eros in order to win. \nAgain, it\u2019s easier said than done\u2026 but a single outfit glittering under the warm yellow lights of his childhood home ends up providing all the information he needs.\n\u201cAh, that one,\u201d enthuses Viktor, leaning over Yuuri\u2019s shoulder to gaze fondly at the garment. Yuuri becomes distracted from the glitter and shine as he becomes hyperaware of the tickle of Viktor\u2019s bangs against his face. \u201cThe fit and appearance of that one suited my performance well\u2014with my longer hair, it gave off the impression of a fluid atmosphere. Both a feminine and masculine feel.\u201d\nAnd Yuuri certainly does remember that exact performance, and he ducks his head down when he feels an undercurrent of something run right through him. An instant later, he clutches the garment to him, bolstered by his newfound inspiration.\n\u201cI choose this one!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYurio presents a performance so stunning that Yuuri is floored by the teenager\u2019s ability to present another side of him through each and every one of his movements, and to make it seem so easy at that\u2014\nYuuri presses his hands against his face, grateful for the sudden darkness that signals the end of Yurio\u2019s program. The anxiety always started off as prickles that began from his shoulders and steadily spread up his neck and trickled down his back to make his knees as weak as jelly. There\u2019s a roaring of white noise in his ears\u2014or is it just the murmur of the audience? And why does his heart sound so loud?\n\u201cYuuri. It\u2019s your turn.\u201d\nYuuri stifles a gasped sob as he flinches upwards to lock eyes with Viktor. Viktor looks supremely confident, as per usual, as Yuuri wishes not for the first time that he could naturally exude the same sort of poise. \n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 going to perform the tastiest pork cutlet bowl you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Yuuri says finally, taking strength from the warmth in Viktor\u2019s eyes. \u201cI promise.\u201d And before he can chicken out, Yuuri steps forward to wrap his arms around Viktor\u2019s neck, his face pressing against soft silver hair.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Viktor says lowly, and Yuuri shudders. \u201cI love pork cutlet bowls.\u201d \nYuuri fights back another onslaught of tears, this time borne from happiness. He tightens his arms around Viktor for one more second before he slides free, allowing himself one more look into Viktor\u2019s eyes. His idol looks completely serious for once, and stares at Yuuri with none of the childish gaiety and mirth that had been constantly present throughout his entire stay in Japan so far. In fact, Viktor has the same look he gets during a performance\u2014cool, calm, and self assured. Yuuri allows himself to indulge in seeing that expression in such close proximity for a while longer before he steps away, skating guards thudding determinedly against cement.\n\u201cWatch me, and only me,\u201d Yuuri says as he leaves, and Viktor finally smiles, a mere upturn of one side of his mouth.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he repeats. \nAnd he does\u2014Yuuri swears he can feel Viktor watching closely throughout the entirety of his program, and his motions become more fluid, more seductive, all in the name of keeping Viktor\u2019s eyes on him and only him.\n\nWho am I dancing for? I know who. \n\nThe performance is all heat\u2014Yuuri nearly breaks his persona when he steps out of his salchow, and his heart stutters before he mentally grips onto his eros with white knuckled hands. He refuses to let go. He refuses to lose. \nI am the one with the power to seduce, Yuuri thinks, making sure his audience knows exactly that. I am the one in control. \nWith a final flourish of his arms, Yuuri cocks out a knee and poses, marking a crisp end to a passionate dance. And I am the one who is going to win his heart.\nThe roar of the audience fills his ears, and Yuuri drops his act as if he\u2019d been burnt, looking around with wide eyes at the screaming faces. Minako and Yuuko both have tears in their eyes, and the triplets continue to eagerly film him at every angle possible. Even Takeshi shoots him a proud thumbs up, amazement clear in his childhood friend\u2019s eyes.\nAnd Viktor\u2014\n\u201cYuuri!\u201d\nHis idol\u2019s voice is like a splash of cold water after a burning day, and Yuuri all but flies to him, barely feeling the ice underneath his skates. He\u2019s welcomed with open arms and Viktor\u2019s smiling face, all lightheartedness returned. \n\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor says again, \u201cthat was the tastiest pork cutlet bowl I have ever seen!\u201d\nYuuri nearly cries with relief, all to happy to settle himself in Viktor\u2019s arms.\nHe\u2019s so overwhelmed with exhaustion and elation that he all but collapses when Viktor immediately transitions to his coaching mode\u2014but, in all honesty, Yuuri can\u2019t say he minds it all too much. \nStanding on the podium and accepting victory is all just a formality that Yuuri knows he doesn\u2019t really need. It\u2019s Viktor\u2019s gloved hands, tight on his arm and elbow, that ground him, and Yuuri lets himself smile his first real exhilarated smile for the first time in ages. \n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cYurio!\u201d\nAh. It\u2019s that girl.\nYuri barely even allows himself to turn, only letting one eye peek past the fabric of his upturned hoodie, and even then the sight of Yuuko worriedly running up to him is almost enough to make the threat of tears all too real.\nAlmost.\n\u201cAre you leaving already? Even without hearing the results?\u201d\nYuri snorts, throat thick as he swallows before answering. \u201cI already know the results. I\u2019m going back to train under Yakov\u2014I\u2019m not stupid enough to stick around and hope.\u201d\nYuri inhales deeply, hand clenching around the handle of his suitcase before he finally turns to regard Yuuko with steely, dry eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019m still going to be the one to win the Grand Prix. I hope they know that.\u201d He grits his teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s a pain to admit, but even with their disgustingly gross connection, even I can still see that his performance was\u2026\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Yuuko says when he doesn\u2019t continue, looking completely lost.\nYuri scowls, and begins to walk away. \u201cNothing. See you later. Dasvidaniya.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\nYuuri lays on his bed that night, feeling all too boneless and satisfied from a victory and a warm bath.\nHe replays the events over and over in his mind, always going over the final few moments where he\u2019d been proclaimed the winner, Viktor\u2019s pleased face taking over his thoughts.\nI won. I won! Yuuri smiles, rolling over in his bed ecstatically. Does this mean I get to eat a pork cutlet bowl?\nHe sits up when he\u2019s struck with another thought. His soulmate. Yuuri eagerly scrambles off his bed and towards his desk, quickly rummaging around for a pen. His soulmate\u2014he has to tell them, wants to tell them what happened, how we won and is so happy, and the only thing that could make this even better is the thought of seeing them tomorrow\u2014\n\u201cYuuri!\u201d Viktor sings, and Yuuri jumps about a foot into the air at the sound of sharp knocking against the wood of his door. He shouldn\u2019t have even bothered knocking, Yuuri thinks bemusedly, as literally five seconds later Viktor bounds through the unceremoniously opened door, Makkachin hot on his heels. \u201cSorry to intrude\u2014really, I am, I just\u2026 I\u2019m so excited!\u201d\nYuuri yelps when he\u2019s wrapped in another hug, and internally screams when he\u2019s lifted off the floor and taken on an elated spin. Seriously, how strong was Viktor? Makkachin barks excitedly, circling them as Viktor takes Yuuri around and around his room. \n\u201cThat was quite a performance! You have things you need to work on, like I said, but that\u2019s what I am here for!\u201d Viktor laughs, and Yuuri yells out as he suddenly feels them topple over.\nHe isn\u2019t sure whether to be relieved or alarmed when he realizes their fall is cushioned by the soft mattress of his bed, and then Viktor\u2019s full body weight is pressing against his, and Yuuri realizes that, yes, alarm is probably the right emotion. \n\u201cAnd now that I\u2019m officially your coach,\u201d Viktor continues, seemingly unruffled, \u201cwe can finally, properly bond!\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Yuuri says, finally ripped away from his Viktor induced la-la land, and his coach (his coach!) laughs again.\n\u201cI still need to see what you look like when you dream!\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Yuuri screeches in English, and Viktor only, infuriatingly laughs again, entangling Yuuri into a playful chokehold. \n\u201cNo, no! This is all a part of the road to victory!\u201d Viktor crows, ruffling Yuuri\u2019s hair with a devilish glint in his eyes. \u201cWe also need to work on your image. Your hairstyle for today\u2019s performance was quite a heart stopper\u2014but your every day style needs to be enhanced!\u201d\nYuuri\u2019s protests dissolve into laughter as Viktor\u2019s fingers roughly comb through his hair.\n\u201cMaybe an everyday slicked back look for my pupil? Oh, my, maybe we could go for an idol boy look? A refreshing military style haircut? People these days like uniformity, I suppose.\u201d Viktor gasps, eyes lighting up. \u201cHow about a style that looks just like mine?\u201d\n\u201cV-Viktor!\u201d Yuuri protests again, though his elated laughter continues to sideline him. \u201cI like my hair!\u201d\n\u201cOh, so do I, but you know the public! They always want better, newer, and brighter!\u201d Viktor sobers then, both hands still entangled in Yuuri\u2019s hair, and Yuuri\u2019s laughter dies off to stare up at his coach. \n\u201cViktor?\u201d he finally says, and Viktor breaks his self-induced staring contest with Yuuri to blink confusedly. \n\u201cHm, what was I saying? Ah well.\u201d Viktor smiles, beginning to comb his hands through Yuuri\u2019s hair, and Yuuri\u2019s eyes begin to droop. Ah, he was a lot sleepier than he\u2019d thought, wasn\u2019t he\u2026\n\u201cI think I was saying something about a military haircut,\u201d comes Viktor\u2019s voice through the fog, and Yuuri struggles to keep his eyes open. But he never knew how nice it felt to have someone play with your hair.\n\u201cSee, we could cut this part, trim right here\u2026\u201d Viktor twirls one of Yuuri\u2019s longer pieces of hair through his fingers, and the breath of his voice is warm against Yuuri\u2019s face. \u201cAnd here, we could\u2026\u201d\nYuuri swears he can\u2019t blame himself for drifting off to sleep\u2014Viktor\u2019s voice is all too soothing, and combined with the hands in his hair and the exhaustion deep in his bones\u2026\nYuuri falls right asleep, right in Viktor\u2019s arms.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\nBarking cuts through Yuuri\u2019s hazy thoughts, and for a second he thinks he\u2019s still dreaming.\n\u201cVicchan?\u201d he asks blearily, beginning to fumble for his glasses. Damn, where were they? What time was it\u2014was it time for Vicchan\u2019s walk?\n\u201cHm?\u201d someone murmurs sleepily from right next to him, and Yuuri\u2019s mind switches back into overdrive.\nHis glasses\u2014he finds them squished underneath his right arm, spares one thought to thank whatever deity that they hadn\u2019t broken, and wastes no time in slamming them on his face to see who exactly was in his bed.\nViktor Nikiforov blinks sleepily up at him, rubbing at his eyes. \u201cHnhuh? Yuuri, what time is it?\u201d\nHis coach\u2019s bleary face and the bright sun streaming through his window tells Yuuri that it\u2019s far too late into the morning, and\u2014\nYuuri freezes as another thought breaks into his mind with all the force and violence of a speeding bullet train.\nYuuri leaps out of bed and over Viktor, silently cursing himself for not setting an alarm. One click of his phone has the time blinking up at him in sharp white numbers, and he feels his heart drop down to his feet.\n1:05 PM.\nHe had been supposed to be on a train and on the way to his soulmate five hours ago.\n\u201cYuuri?\u201d Viktor asks. \u201cTime?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s one in the afternoon,\u201d Yuuri whispers, stricken. Behind him, the rustle of sheets halts immediately, and Yuuri turns to find Viktor looking as horrified as he did. \n\u201cI\u2026\u201d And suddenly his coach is springing to life, tucking the inn\u2019s robes tighter around himself (Yuuri blushes at the peek of skin, despite himself) and tugs his own phone out of one of his pockets. Viktor lets out a low groan and presses a hand against his face, looking utterly devastated. \n\u201cI\u2026 was supposed to be somewhere,\u201d Yuuri says quietly, still horrified with himself. \u201cAnd I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Viktor says from behind his hand, before rubbing at his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2026 do you have a pen?\u201d\n\u201cA pen?\u201d Yuuri echoes, still reeling from the fact that he has missed his meeting with his soulmate by a distressingly great number of hours. \u201cSure, I\u2026\u201d\nViktor freezes, and glances at Yuuri as if suddenly realizes who he\u2019s speaking to, and raises another hand to stop him. \u201cI mean\u2014I just need one to write out a reminder for the itinerary of out training schedule. I don\u2019t need one right now. I mean, if you have one, then wonderful, Yuuri! I could use it to scratch a spot on my back that is just absolutely killing me right now, and I can\u2019t reach, but oh! It\u2019s passed! I\u2019ll just be going now, so you can keep your pen. For homework.\u201d\n\u201cI already graduated from college,\u201d Yuuri says blankly, and Viktor exasperatedly waves him off, looking uncharacteristically flustered.\n\u201cYes, I know\u2014training starts tomorrow, Yuuri, first I have to take care of some\u2026\u201d Viktor glances at him one last time before he takes off and out the door, Makkachin close behind, \u201cbusiness.\u201d \nYuuri sinks to the floor after his coach breezes out the door, staring at his distressingly ink-free hands with no little amount of horror.\n\nWhat... What do I do?\n\nAt ten, Viktor isn\u2019t interested in much beyond the wide expanse of the ice skating rink and the early Saturday morning cartoons he gets to watch on the living room television. Now though, he can recall vague memories of conversations between aunts, or the titters of his cousins and classmates, all regarding one thing: their soulmates. \nIt was an interesting thing\u2014he would be animatedly speaking to a friend, only for him to cut Viktor off and wave a hand suddenly filling with unsteadily scrawled words right in his face. \u201cLook! She is writing her name\u2014it is what she does when she wants to get my attention!\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Viktor would say cheerfully, still slightly confused as to why that would have been important enough to interrupt a conversation. \u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d \nA teacher would be writing on a board, discussing a math concept, when Viktor would catch the smallest of notes sliding into existence on the back of her right hand.\n\u201cAh,\u201d she says when Viktor quietly asks her after the class had ended, \u201cit\u2019s a reminder from my wife to pick up milk before I come home.\u201d \nViktor even notices his mother writing notes to his father, and vice versa, even when they were in the same room.\nWeird, Viktor thinks some days as he floats across the rink. But interesting. The other ice skaters, both in classes of their own, or skating for pleasure, all stop to look at him, something he acknowledges with another jauntily done spin. Viktor preens a little on the inside at the ensuing oohs and aahs of his viewers, and the topic of soulmates is dropped from his mind. \nHe\u2019s fourteen when he realizes two things. One, he\u2019s very, very good at figure skating, and decides that it\u2019s something he\u2019s going to do competitively, and for the rest of his life.\nTwo, Viktor realizes that he may not even have a soulmate at all.\nHe remembers sitting next to his classmates in primary school and idly watching as their hands filled with colors, even when they were merely sitting still. Viktor\u2019s hands were almost covered with markers and paint, and he realizes now that he couldn\u2019t have discerned his markings from his soulmate\u2019s\u2014had they even been there in the first place.\nBut now, it seemed as if soulmates were all that people could talk about, and a tiny pinprick of unease begins to blossom in Viktor\u2019s chest.\nViktor begins to write\u2014on his hands, and all over his arms. Swooping Russian characters describing his thoughts for the day, things he needed to remember, and even some ideas for choreography.\nAnd still, his handwriting remains the only thing he sees on his skin, and Viktor grows more and more frustrated by the day.\nIt\u2019s around this age that he realizes the pull he has towards people of all types. Viktor would raise his eyes from his homework, only to lock eyes with a girl who would quickly turn red or turn away. More than once, Viktor finds himself fending off confessions from both girls and boys.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have a soulmate?\u201d Viktor finds himself asking on multiple occasions, innocently tilting his head. The other person would flush, guiltily tucking both hands behind their back before stuttering an excuse and darting away.\nOnce, Viktor receives a \u201cno\u201d in response to his question, and his lighthearted smile almost drops in his surprise.\n\u201cReally?\u201d Viktor asks, eyes wide. His skin suddenly feels hypersensitive, all too aware of the ink on his arms that he\u2019d placed there himself.\n\u201cReally,\u201d the girl replies, staring him determinedly in the eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in it. Sure, people can be with their soulmates\u2014but since I don\u2019t have one, I believe I\u2019ve been given the freedom of choice.\u201d She wavers then, before biting her lip and finally asking the one question Viktor has asked himself for quite some time. \n\u201cDo you have a soulmate?\u201d\nViktor pauses before answering, tapping his fingers from where he rests them on his hip. \u201cYes,\u201d he says finally, ignoring the burning sensation in his chest. \u201cI do. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nThe girl\u2019s eyes fill with tears, and for one long moment, Viktor thinks she\u2019s going to burst out crying\u2014but then she steps away, a steely glint appearing in her eyes.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying. I\u2019ve watched you. You only ever write, and nothing else ever appears on your skin.\u201d She furiously rubs at her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll get tired of waiting. Believe me.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Viktor replies with an easy smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nShe dashes off with one last longing, but baleful, look at the writing on Viktor\u2019s arms, and Viktor stands in the corridor, feeling distinctly unsettled. \n\nI have one. I do.\n\nBecoming a sixteen year old marks the beginning of some of the best years of Viktor\u2019s life, and some of the most difficult. By sixteen, he\u2019s floated to the top of the rankings in the world of figure skating, constantly being hailed for his talent and his poise. \nViktor also finds himself dedicating more and more hours to training, silently deciding that he would always surprise. Always inspire. \nHowever, it\u2019s also at the age of sixteen that Viktor realizes that, if he has a soulmate, he wants them. Full stop\u2014Viktor wants to have a soulmate. \nHis longing and desire for \u201csomeone just for him\u201d leaks into some of his performances, with judges and critics praising them as some of his best yet. Viktor merely accepts the compliments with his go-to cordial smile, waves off Yakov\u2019s criticism, and goes back to determinedly scrawling on his arm.\nThe morning after one of his competitions, Viktor lounges on his bed and stares at the blank expanse of skin, stretching and flexing his fingers. \nOne more time, Viktor thinks almost lazily\u2014near hopelessly, even. His right hand comes up to worriedly tug at the length of his hair, restlessly twining the end of his ponytail around his fingers.Just one last try.\nViktor slowly draws out the first line, and another one parallel to that. The tic-tac-toe board looks lonely on his hand, and Viktor exhales, feeling oddly nervous.\nOne X goes into a square, and Viktor waits.\nAnd waits.\nViktor sits up against his headboard, clenching the pen in his fist and letting the plastic dig into the palm of his hand. \u201cI know you\u2019re there,\u201d he whispers, feeling his throat tighten. \u201cI know you exist.\u201d\nHe bolds the X, careful enough not to let the pen dig into his skin. Viktor pauses, holding his breath, and lets it out when a few seconds pass and nothing else appears. \nNo one, Viktor thinks, staring almost balefully at his hand. He struggles to pull up his usual cheer, but it\u2019s as if there\u2019s a weight sitting on it, and he can only continue to silently come to terms with the fact he\u2019s got to give up. No one\u2019s been on the other side for y\u2014\nA circle appears. \nViktor nearly chucks the pen across the room in his delight, and leaps from his bed in an elated arc that takes him from one side of the room to another. In a homage to his skating abilities, he spins in place in his socks as he covers the entirety of his left hand with crudely drawn hearts.\nHe can\u2019t help it\u2014Viktor is excited, and even though he knows he should probably be mad, he isn\u2019t, and he can only hope that every single inked heart conveys the love and affection he\u2019s had cooped up all of those years.\nWhen Viktor feels that he\u2019s conveyed enough of his never ending love in ink form (and feels that his dizziness level are reaching dangerous heights), he collapses back onto his bed, and writes out another X with a shaking hand. \nViktor\u2019s soulmate\u2014his soulmate\u2014draws out a shy little heart near their circle. In a flash, Viktor springs up from his bed and races down the hallways, hardly noticing when he nearly careens into someone\u2014his mother?\u2014in an effort to get to the bathroom. Even before the door slams shut behind him, Viktor is already scrubbing away at the ink until his skin is gray with its residue.\nGood enough! he thinks impatiently, and his pen flies down onto his skin.\nI have always, always wanted to meet you! I am so happy you exist! Viktor draws in a heart with a little flourish, holding his breath as he waits for a reply. \nIt takes a couple seconds, but characters slowly flow into existence on his hand, and Viktor\u2019s eyebrows dart up to his hairline in his surprise. \nHe writes out his surprise and follows it with a quickly drawn flag of Japan. Japanese?\nA potato appears underneath it\u2014oh, wait. Viktor pauses to bring his hand closer to his eyes, and smiles in amusement. Oh. Thumbs up. \nViktor promptly decides that they could be from Mars for all he cares, and he would still love them. He says so too, even if he knows now that they don\u2019t understand, and etches out another few hearts for good measure. \n\u201cNo wonder they haven\u2019t said anything all these years,\u201d Viktor breathes. He darts out of the bathroom, and promptly receives a reprimanding smack on the head from his mother as he nearly crashes into her again. \nHe continues onto his room, highly unbothered, dotting his hand with hearts along the way. \n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nStill, Viktor quickly finds out that having a soulmate does not immediately mean\u2026 well, \u201cThe End\u201d. \nIt\u2019s almost a constant struggle to get his soulmate to write anything, though he graciously accepts every chance he gets to trade even the smallest of phrases with them. His heart soars the first time they greet him in carefully worded Russian, and he eagerly seeks out different methods of learning Japanese. Many of Viktor\u2019s pre-performance psyche ups consisted of Japanese vocabulary filtering into his ears through tinny ear buds, and he sketches the characters he knows in the air as he practices his choreography in the hallways of the stadium.\n\u201c\u2018I love you\u2019,\u201d Viktor enunciates airily, and Yakov shoots him a raised eyebrow as he dances past. \u201c\u2018I. Love. You.\u2019\u201d\nIf his audience thought they couldn\u2019t be more stunned from his abilities than they already were, they were proven wrong at the way Viktor\u2019s newfound gusto translated into each and every one of his movements. \nHowever, Viktor still has to tell himself to be patient after a couple of failed attempts at getting into contact with his soulmate beyond ink on skin communication. He sighs at the forlorn looking, sorry on his hand, and replies back with a cheerfully rounded OK in English. And then, love you! in Japanese.\nViktor preens when he doesn\u2019t get a response, fancying that he can feel the other\u2019s shyness filtering through his skin. He worked hard on getting the phrase right, after all. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2018No\u2019,\u201d Viktor says, drawing out the word until it fills the empty space around him with its negativity. He sighs inwardly. \u201c\u2019No.\u2019\u201d\nHe promptly turns to his dog for comfort, and Makkachin whines, tail wagging. \nHe\u2019d been hoping\u2026 Viktor buries his face deeper in Makkachin\u2019s fur for a second longer. The years had been peppered with exchanges between him and his soulmate, and while Viktor cherished each and every one of those occasions, he\u2019d been hoping to finally meet them face to face. To have true love bring back the magic into his performances, to be inspired and inspire in return\u2014\nViktor is in the middle of jokingly (and half seriously) contemplating whether or not it\u2019s worth it to invest in one of those shady looking companies he\u2019d seen that supposedly, somehow leads you to your soulmate, when his phone chimes cheerfully in the silence. \nViktor tugs it out, ready to text. Instead, he finds a message from Yakov with a video link and nothing else, and when he clicks on it, the title startles him. \nViktor isn\u2019t sure what he expects when he clicks the play button\u2014but as soon as the video ends, he\u2019s one hundred percent sure he knows what he wants. \nKatsuki Yuuri has piqued his interest, and Viktor thinks he\u2019s finally decided what his \u201cnext step\u201d was going to be.\n\nHow interesting!\n\n(And he ignores the fact that Yuuri is currently based in Japan, where Viktor firmly believed the other half of his heart to reside.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\nKatsuki Yuuri, however, does turn out to be very interesting.\nAnd so fun! Viktor thinks amusedly, watching his soon-to-be pupil slam right back into the wall behind him. How cute!\nIn fact, getting to know Yuuri is far more interesting than it should probably be, and Viktor finds himself entranced the first time he sees Yuuri skating, right after Yurio\u2019s arrival. \n(Speaking of which\u2014Yurio. Viktor lightly berates himself for his own forgetfulness, but ah, what can he do about it? After all, they\u2019d ended up getting something fun out of all of it!)\nIt\u2019s the same atmosphere that Viktor had seen in the video, but to see it for himself, in person\u2026 it\u2019s completely different. Viktor isn\u2019t sure what he expects when he asks, \u201cWho were you thinking of?\u201d\nWhat had he been expecting? For Yuuri to beam at him and say, \u2019Oh, just my very amazing and talented idol, Viktor Nikiforov!\u2019?\n\u2019I was thinking about my soulmate.\u2019 Yuuri\u2019s words echo in his mind now, and Viktor sighs, rubbing at his bare left hand. How envious. \nViktor freezes, fingers tightening around his left wrist. I mean\u2014I do the same. Of course. His passion is just\u2026 He hesitates, smoothing his bangs away from his face, part of him missing the weight of a longer length on his head. It\u2019s just\u2026 interesting.\nBut teasing Yuuri, watching Yuuri, becoming delightedly baffled at his determination to utilize pork cutlet bowls, of all things, as his inspiration for eros\u2026 \nThough it\u2019s only been a few weeks, being around Yuuri has grown more and more addicting, and Viktor can\u2019t help but feel as if some distinct part of him is slipping. Some part of him is drawn to Yuuri\u2014and another piece holds a little fear for himself at what could happen if he continued to learn more and more about the man he left everything to coach.\nIt\u2019s mainly because of that, that Viktor steels himself to try and ask once more for his soulmate to meet him, feeling grounded as he touches the pen to his skin. These were phrases he\u2019d practiced over and over again, in notebooks, on pamphlets, and even on restaurant napkins. Viktor even has an exact picture of what he\u2019d like to write somewhere on his phone, but he recalls the exact wording and characters from memory. In Japan for business. Ask one time. OK if \u2018no\u2019. Viktor\u2019s hand twitches a little as he writes that part\u2014a \u2018no\u2019 is not okay, but he\u2019ll swallow the bitter pill of rejection for his soulmate if he has to. Again. Will you meet me?\nViktor has already resigned himself to be rebuffed once more, and is quietly resolving himself to love his soulmate no matter what, when he realizes his soulmate has already responded.\nHis heart leaps at the excitedly scrawled yes! written in messy Russian, but Viktor really couldn\u2019t care less about the visual\u2014his soulmate could have drawn out that potato-looking thumbs up again and Viktor would still be over the moon. \nViktor closes his eyes and presses his lips against the ink for a split second before penning out one last message to his love. I\u2019m so happy.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m so screwed.\n\nViktor groans loudly, alone in his room in the Katsuki\u2019s Yu-Topia save for Makkachin, who barks at his owner with increasing worry. It\u2019s the morning after that catastrophe of an afternoon wake up call, and Viktor hasn\u2019t seen Yuuri since dinner the night prior\u2014who, Viktor had noticed, had been quiet, more so than usual, opting to stare at his hands rather than the steaming pork cutlet bowl placed in front of him. Which was odd, because wasn\u2019t the pork cutlet bowl Yuuri\u2019s entire reason for his performance the day before? But Viktor had to admit that he could relate\u2014Viktor had been far too absorbed in waiting on any sign from his soulmate to fully pay attention to his surroundings, and had scarfed down his own bowl in record time before all but flying back to his room.\n\u201cAh, Makkachin, what have I done!\u201d Viktor wails, hugging the dog around his neck and burying his nose in the soft fur there. \u201cThey hate me! Years of poking and prodding at them for a meeting, and the day of, what do I do? I abandon them!\u201d \nMakkachin licks worriedly at Viktor\u2019s face, whines increasing in volume. Viktor struggles to keep his own voice down, all too aware of the fact that his pupil, the man he was supposed to be coaching, the man he spent the night cuddling with, could walk nearby or into Viktor\u2019s room at any moment. Just in time for a full-out, uncharacteristic Nikiforov breakdown, Viktor thinks sullenly, gently pulling Makkachin close. The poodle sniffs at Viktor\u2019s face as if to gauge whether or not his owner was finally through with his theatrics. \nIn all honesty, Viktor hadn\u2019t meant to stay the night. It hadn\u2019t been until well into his military haircut spiel that Viktor noticed that Yuuri had fallen asleep right then and there, no doubt having passed out from the excitement and the exhaustion of the day. It had been late too\u2014Viktor had waltzed in near midnight after seeing Yuuri\u2019s lights still on, fully intent on berating his pupil for not sleeping, and had been completely and totally sidetracked the minute he\u2019d seen Yuuri\u2019s blushing face. \nSomewhere in the middle of all the hair ruffling, Viktor remembers part of him feeling like he\u2019d just gotten himself into trouble, and the next thing he knew, Viktor was carding his hands through Yuuri\u2019s hair like a teenage boy experiencing his first bout of puppy love.\nI am in love, Viktor thinks grandly, flicking his hair away from his face, with my soulmate!\nYuuri\u2019s eyes, crinkled from laughter, flash in his mind, and Makkachin barks at his owner incredulously when Viktor sprawls out on the floor, ears turning a bright red. \n\u201cHmm,\u201d Viktor says to his dog, the couch, the ridiculously expensive lamp in the corner of the room. \u201cComplicated.\u201d\nMakkachin sighs as if in agreement, flopping down next to Viktor and looking thoroughly done with his owner\u2019s dramatic antics. \n\u201cMakkachin,\u201d Viktor says suddenly, \u201cpen!\u201d\nMakkachin opens his mouth and yawns straight into Viktor\u2019s face.\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Viktor says again, mouth dipping into a frown. \u201cRude.\u201d\nHe ends up having to get one for himself, and flops down onto Makkachin, who gives him a good natured nibble on the shoulder. \n\u201c\u2018I am sorry\u2019,\u201d Viktor recites to the back of his dog\u2019s head, smiling graciously, \u201c\u2018for leaving you alone in the place where we agreed to meet, alone, where you waited, alone\u2014\u2018\u201c\nViktor allows himself one Russian curse word, before slapping the pen down to the floor next to him. \u201cDo I even know the Japanese word for alone?\u201d\nViktor closes his eyes. How could he have gotten himself into this mess? He was twenty-seven. Years and years of victories upon victories, and he chooses something different and then\u2014\nYuuri. Viktor sighs, recalling the feel of Yuuri\u2019s hair in his hands and the sound of the other man\u2019s laughter. Yuuri hadn\u2019t laughed like that in front of Viktor before that night, had he? Viktor tries to recall, but all that pops up is Yuuri\u2019s constantly startled, blushing face.\nWell. Maybe I\u2019ve teased him a little too much, Viktor thinks, feeling slightly chastened. But he\u2019s just so adorable!\nAgain, Viktor truly hadn\u2019t meant to stay the entire night. But even after Yuuri had fallen asleep\u2026 Viktor\u2019s mouth twists in equal parts childish frustration and embarrassment. Seriously! To have allowed himself to flop down next to Yuuri and just watch him sleep\u2026 Viktor\u2019s face smooths out into a goofy smile. He hadn\u2019t recalled ever being that peaceful in a long while. Viktor\u2019s face scrunches up again. Maybe Yuuri\u2019s face had a calming effect equivalent to the feeling one gets watching a goldfish swimming around in its bowl\u2026?\nA low woof is all the warning he gets before Makkachin nips on his hand\u2014hard.\n\u201cMakkachin!\u201d Viktor gasps, betrayed. He sits up, staring at his poodle with no little amount of shock. \u201cNo premium dog food for you!\u201d\nMakkachin pants and leans forward to lick at Viktor\u2019s left hand, and Viktor all but snatches it away when he sees ink, his heart leaping into his throat.\n\u201cNevermind, you get all the treats you want,\u201d Viktor amends distractedly, eyes already scanning the words there. It takes him a little while, because this time all the Russian words have been haphazardly traced into some semblance of a full sentence, and Viktor\u2019s heart goes out to the soulmate he has never even met.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I did not go. I couldn\u2019t get there. Please don\u2019t hate me.\n\nViktor narrows his eyes, thoroughly confused. They hadn\u2019t been able to make it either? In an instant, Viktor feels as if a weight has fallen of his chest, and he eagerly responds the best he can.\nNo! Couldn\u2019t go either. I don\u2019t hate you! \nA long pause, and then: Really? I\u2019m so relieved\u2026\nSo am I. Viktor bites his lip, tapping his pen on his knee. His hand has already filled with a smattering of Russian and Japanese from their brief exchange, and still he struggles to find words in both languages that can best convey what he wants to say. Viktor is so eloquent in Russian, and isn\u2019t half-bad either in speaking Japanese or English, if what his fans are saying is true. But never before has he had to struggle to convey a simple message through writing. There is so much Viktor could say, so much he could have figured out by now\u2026 if only language hadn\u2019t been such a difficult barrier to overcome. \nViktor taps his pen on his lips thoughtfully. Though\u2026 did he even actually want to know more about them? The thought nearly has him reeling, but Viktor can\u2019t deny that there is some truth to it all\u2014in all the years he\u2019d been in contact with his soulmate, Viktor had never seriously attempted to get to know them past their location. But their name, their gender\u2026 Viktor frowns. All a mystery. Yes, he\u2019s desperately wanted to meet them for quite some time, but there was no way around the realization that he wholeheartedly enjoyed the idea of a soulmate, the mystery surrounding it, and the pining. Viktor straightens himself up into a cross legged position, smoothing his hair back agitatedly. Had he ever even thought about what would come after the meeting? The girl from his secondary school days pops up in his mind after years of trying to ignore her words, and Viktor feels the tiniest current of unease run through him.\n\u201cLet\u2019s meet, let\u2019s meet,\u201d Viktor murmurs to himself, frowning. \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s meet\u2019, I say, but I don\u2019t even know what happens after that.\u201d\nWould they be willing to move to Russia? Viktor likes Japan, but\u2026 would he be willing to stay for someone he will basically just have met?\nNow, Yuuri, though. Viktor would stay for Yuuri. \nViktor curses his brain quite soundly. \nOf course Viktor would stay for Yuuri. Because I\u2019m his coach! Viktor thinks, rather proudly. He\u2019s going to win the Grand Prix with my help and experience.\nHe hasn\u2019t known Yuuri long, but Viktor can tell that something is there, underneath the shyness and the anxiety. There was something special about Yuuri, and Viktor was looking forward to seeing his growth as a skater. \nBut first\u2026 Viktor looks down at his hand to see that nothing new had been added to the conversation. His soulmate was obviously waiting for a reply, and Viktor sighs before penning down a solid looking, Let\u2019s try again.\n\u201cVicchan! Breakfast!\u201d Mama Katsuki calls through the door, and Viktor bounds up to slide it open, genial smile already in place. \n\u201cGood morning!\u201d he coos, smile growing wider when Yuuri\u2019s mother beams back at him. \u201cIt looks like I woke up just in time!\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes!\u201d Mama Katsuki replies, bustling Viktor and Makkachin down the stairs. \u201cYuuri has already started eating, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s excited to start his first day of official training!\u201d\nViktor hums in agreement, feeling his heart pick up speed at the sight of Yuuri quietly munching away at his breakfast, eyes down. Still quiet, actually. Viktor cocks his head, feeling a little confused. Didn\u2019t Yuuri get his pork cutlet bowl last night in celebration? Shouldn\u2019t he at least look a little bit happier?\nYuuri startles when Viktor slides into a seated position across the table, but smiles when Makkachin sidles up to him to place a fluffy head on his shoulder.\n\u201cGood morning, Yuuri\u2014I hope you got a good enough night\u2019s sleep?\u201d Viktor smiles gently when Yuuri\u2019s cheeks tint a light pink. Still cute. And far too easy too tease, but Viktor pauses and internally scolds himself. Maybe in moderation then, he amends cheerfully. \n\u201cGood morning. I did,\u201d Yuuri replies, smiling weakly. \u201cI think I\u2019m just a little sluggish, but I promise I\u2019ll be fine as soon as we get started. His left hand comes up to scratch at his head sheepishly, and Viktor freezes. \u201cI'm a little tired but I\u2019ve been looking forward to being coached by you, Viktor! So\u2026\u201d\nYuuri could have been suddenly spouting the words to the Russian National Anthem, and Viktor wouldn\u2019t have registered it at all because\u2014\nWhat. Viktor blinks, hard, his eyes following Yuuri\u2019s hand as it settles back down to disappear behind the table.\n\nWhat\u2014?\n\n\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor says tightly, keeping his voice carefully cheerful. \u201cYou seem to have a message from your soulmate.\u201d\n\u201cWha\u2026?\u201d Yuuri turns bright red when he looks down at his hand and realizes what Viktor means. \u201cOh, n-no, I\u2019ve already seen it! I\u2019m sorry for just blatantly showing it off, I\u2019m not actually trying to show off or anything, it\u2019s just that we were talking, and I wanted to keep it their messages for as long as I could\u2026\u201d\nViktor beams, feeling his cheek muscles begin to hurt. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. It all depends on how you feel about it\u2014I\u2019ve known people who are rather private about it, but I don\u2019t get too bothered if someone catches a glimpse once in a while.\u201d\n\u201cO-oh, I don\u2019t mind either,\u201d Yuuri agrees, waving both hands in the air, and Viktor\u2019s smile stays plastered onto his face even as his eyes hungrily follow the glimpses of ink he sees. \u201cI mean, we actually don\u2019t have too many conversations because of the language barrier, so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Viktor\u2019s voice sounds like it\u2019s risen about two more octaves higher than usual, but in his fluster, Yuuri hardly seems to notice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty interesting, I mean, we had some\u2026 misunderstandings\u2026 recently,\u201d Yuuri says, quieting down, \u201cor something like that\u2026 But still, I\u2019ve learned some of their language, and it\u2019s been interesting.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Viktor echoes. Makkachin pads around the table to settle himself against Viktor\u2019s side, and Viktor carefully buries his left hand into Makkachin\u2019s fur as he beams back at Yuuri, who looks incredibly, adorably embarrassed. \u201cYes. It seems that way. I couldn\u2019t help but notice that it was Russian on your hand\u2014\u201c\n\u201cO-oh, yes!\u201d Yuuri says. \u201cWhat are the odds, right? They live in Russia. Maybe you or Yurio have met them before I have!\u201d He laughs nervously. \u201cJust kidding\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPossibly,\u201d Viktor replies. Is his smile still on his face? He doesn\u2019t know. All he knows is that his hopes have suddenly been elevated so fast that Viktor is surprised they haven\u2019t left a visible hole in the roof above them. \u201cIt\u2019s alright if it bothers you, so you can say no, but may I see? I\u2019m just curious as to how you two communicate.\u201d\nYuuri\u2019s face turns an alarming shade of red, and he visibly hesitates, eyes flicking up at Viktor and back down to his hand.\nViktor desperately needs to know. Still, he forces himself to make sure his smile is gentle as he waits, and eventually Yuuri gives him a shy smile, and slowly presents Viktor his left hand, and Yuuri\u2019s coach leans forward to stare intently at inked skin.\n\u201cWe have trouble communicating, because writing is much more difficult than speaking,\u201d Yuuri says, and Viktor hazily thinks, Yes. Yes it is. \u201cSo that means I don\u2019t really know much about them.\u201d He frowns, looking a little sad. \u201cAt all. But I\u2019ve learned some Russian, so that\u2019s my handwriting in Russian, right there. Sorry if it doesn\u2019t look very right, I had to kind of rely on a store bought dictionary\u2026\u201d\nViktor wants to fling himself across the table and lock Yuuri into an embrace even as much as he wants to smack both their heads together, because really. Seriously. How could they have been so blind?\n\u201cI\u2026 think your Russian looks fine,\u201d Viktor says, eyes still glued to the words, both his and Yuuri\u2019s, an exact transcript of the conversation on Viktor\u2019s own left hand. His hand flexes in Makkachin\u2019s fur self-consciously. \n\u201cThank you!\u201d Yuuri beams, and Viktor smiles right back. \nYuuri is mine, is all Viktor can think. Mine, mine, mine.\n\u201cAmazing,\u201d Viktor says instead. He presses a finger against his lips in thought (his right hand, naturally. His left stays hidden in Makkachin\u2019s fur) and snaps his fingers decisively, making Yuuri jump. \n\u201cWhat an incredible love story. No wonder your eros was so convincing during the Hot Springs on Ice!\u201d\nYuuri visibly blanches at that, and Viktor feels a tiny pinprick of confusion, before it\u2019s washed away by his own resolve. \u201cWell. I think it\u2019s time to get ready for training,\u201d Viktor says cheerily as he stands. He picks up Makkachin like a ragdoll, ensuring that the poodle\u2019s paws are carefully covering any glimpse of his inked hand. \n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to eat?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m plenty satisfied,\u201d Viktor replies, jauntily stepping towards the door, Makkachin dangling happily in his arms. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a while to get ready before we begin our warm-up, yes? I\u2019ll meet you at the door in an hour!\u201d\n\u201cA-alright,\u201d Yuuri answers shyly, and then Viktor is out the door, so deep in his own thoughts that he hardly realizes where he was going.\nWas Viktor still going to take his coaching seriously? He scoffs inwardly. Of course. However, were Yakov\u2019s accusations that Viktor was a selfish man entirely false?\nOnce he slides the door of his room shut, Viktor sets Makkachin down and stares down at the back of his left hand. No. Not so false at all.\nViktor smiles, eyes hooded, and he presses the back of his hand against his lips once again. \nEven if Yuuri only thought of Viktor as his idol, he still had to have Viktor on his mind a majority of the time, especially now that Yuuri saw him every day. He was sure of it. However\u2026 Viktor didn\u2019t think he liked sharing a headspace with Yuuri\u2019s vague idea of another person as his soulmate.\nWith all the hesitation and unsurety lifted clear off his shoulders, Viktor feels as light as a bird, all prior confidence restored.\n\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor says, gently flopping down onto his bed and raising his hand in the air. \u201cYou can wait a little while longer, can\u2019t you?\u201d\nViktor solemnly decides that the only time that Yuuri was ever going to find out about their connection was after all he could think about was Viktor, and only Viktor.\nHe laughs suddenly, and Makkachin settles himself into the bed next to his owner, cocking his head inquisitively. Viktor pats his dog on the head, feeling absolutely elated. \u201cI can\u2019t wait!\u201d\nYuuri doubles over, hazily watching as one drop of sweat slides down a strand of his hair until it falls with barely a sound onto the ice beneath him. \nIt\u2019s the fifth time\u2014the fifth time he\u2019s tried to land a quadruple salchow, and the combination of nerves and exhaustion is slowly getting to him. Yuuri\u2019s bones and muscles ache thanks to the strain and the impact of falling on hard ice, and he straightens himself back up with a groan. \n\u201cYou always seem to fall out of your jumps when you\u2019re thinking about something,\u201d calls out a lilted voice. \u201cIsn\u2019t that so, Yuuri?\u201d\nYuuri allows himself just a few more long seconds of staring at his skates before turning around to meet the eyes of his coach. Viktor leans back on one leg with his arms crossed, staring at Yuuri with unreadable eyes. As soon as Yuuri looks up though, Viktor switches to one of his kindest smiles of the day, and Yuuri feels his face begin to heat up from something other than exertion. \n\u201cY-yes,\u201d Yuuri replies, looking down to brush the ice away from his pants as an excuse to look away. \u201cI\u2019m also just a little tired, but I\u2019d really rather power through than end it without landing a single one\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMm,\u201d Viktor says in lieu of actual agreement, and is still smiling affectionately when Yuuri looks back at him again.\nViktor has been\u2026 weird, to say the least. Weirder? Something about him had seemed a little different than usual since their breakfast together. Actually, Viktor hadn\u2019t even eaten any breakfast. He had told himself to shrug it off, especially since Viktor\u2019s advice and coaching had still been sound throughout the morning. And after all, Yuuri was pretty sure all of Viktor\u2019s quirks were a Viktor-thing, since Yurio certainly didn\u2019t act as oddly or flamboyantly as the older man did. \nStill, it wasn\u2019t even a matter of flamboyancy. Viktor already had a penchant for skin ship, and as odd as it was, Yuuri was slowly (but very slowly) beginning to get used to it. But the sudden appearances of a quietly sincere Viktor throughout the morning had began to take Yuuri off guard, and even his lighthearted touches had suddenly seemed to feel heavy with meaning.\nWhich was ridiculous\u2014Yuuri ran his hands through his hair in an effort to shake off some of the sweat, watching detachedly as more droplets fell from his hair. Shouldn\u2019t Yuuri already know that all of Viktor\u2019s actions were borne out of his usual easygoing affection? The man treated everyone and everything with the same amount of cheer. But\u2026 Yuuri shook his head, enjoying the feel of the cool air of the rink against his neck. He had to admit that Viktor really only ever initiated actual physical contact with him so far. Had he ever done that with Yurio? Yuuri presses his hands against his lower back and arches in attempt to work out some of the kinks from his last fall. Has Viktor ever acted like that with other skaters? Yuuri suppresses an inane surge of jealousy. Even if he had, it wasn\u2019t any of Yuuri\u2019s business\u2014\n\u201cYuuri, as much as I\u2019m enjoying the show, I think you should get back to practice.\u201d Viktor sounds highly amused, and his grin widens when Yuuri\u2019s head whips around to stare at his coach in shock. \u201cGive me one last try, and then we\u2019re calling it a day. Judging from what I\u2019m seeing, I think someone needs a relaxing bath in the hot springs.\u201d\nYuuri\u2019s face goes from lightly flushed to completely roasted in barely a second, and he quickly presses a gloved hand against his face. \u201cS-sorry! Sorry!\u201d\n\u201cEnough of that! Let\u2019s get ready for take-off, yeah? Or else your nickname really is going to end up being Aeroflot from now on!\u201d\n\u201cAh, no, no, no,\u201d Yuuri says hastily, quickly skating to position. Viktor quiets, and the same gentle smile is back as his coach presses his fingers against his mouth in quiet observance. Yuuri swallows nervously, dragging his eyes away from Viktor and back to the flat plane of ice before him. \n\nYou always seem to fall out of your jumps when you\u2019re thinking about something.\n\nYuuri inhales, one long steady breath, letting the cool air chill him and sharpen his focus. He tries to ignore the buzz that he gets from the knowledge that Viktor is standing there, watching him, and instead thinks about the speed and power he needs in order to make his jump. \nHis boots dig into his feet, pressing against the sorer spots, and the sweat on his skin is beginning to cool uncomfortably, but Yuuri ignores that too. His mouth tightens in a thin line. Yuuri barely lets himself think about it, pushing off with his good leg and plunging right into the jump. This one feels different from the rest\u2014Yuuri feels lighter than ever, and his exhale as he lands is hardly a puff of air, his skates slicing against the ice with a crisp sound. \nYuuri looks up elatedly, expecting Viktor to cheerfully begin clapping, or maybe even just light praise, so he\u2019s surprised when he turns and is met with a wall of black fabric.\n\u201cWonderful, Yuuri, I knew you could make it!\u201d Viktor cheers as he lifts Yuuri clear off the ice, and Yuuri yelps as his hands scrabble for purchase, falling to grip at Viktor\u2019s biceps. \n\u201cI\u2014thank you\u2014\u201c\nInstead of being set down like he\u2019d expected, Yuuri is surprised to find himself trapped in a bear hug as Viktor gleefully skates them both across the ice, and as Yuuri\u2019s legs dangle in the air, part of him wonders if this is what Makkachin feels like most of the time. \n\u201cVery good, very good,\u201d Viktor says in English, \u201ca good end to a good practice! Of course, there is still improvement to be made, and don\u2019t you remember what I said about your free leg? Also, now that you\u2019ve gotten a rough landing down, we need to work out the technicalities of\u2026\u201d\nYuuri allows himself to be carted to the edge of the rink, the blush on his face at its lowest setting as he idly listens to Viktor chatter on. He\u2019s listening, of course, as he always does, but Yuuri can\u2019t help but let part of himself relax\u2014Viktor doesn\u2019t seem like a traditional sort of coach (after all, he only really had Celestino to compare him to), but he\u2019s beginning to enjoy learning under Viktor in comparison to Celestino by far. Even if his coach does things like\u2014\n\u201cYuuri!\u201d Viktor throws an arm around Yuuri as the younger man stands to sling his backpack over one shoulder. \u201cCome with me to the ramen place!\u201d\n\u201cThe last time you went, you drank till morning,\u201d Yuuri hedges mildly, beginning to smile in spite of himself.\n\u201cYe-es, but that\u2019s why you need to come with me! If I have company, I\u2019ll be less likely to indulge myself in solo drinking! I can\u2019t have you drinking either, not on the training schedule I have you on.\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Yuuri replies, eager. \nViktor beams down at Yuuri, and Yuuri can\u2019t help it when his eyes widen in surprise as Viktor tugs him closer to his side. \u201cGood enthusiasm!\u201d\nYuuri laughs nervously, squeezing the straps of his backpack. He enjoyed Viktor\u2019s company, but even so\u2026 having your idol around was certainly an experience. \nStill, even if having Viktor around was a novel experience that sent Yuuri\u2019s heart into a violent skip stepping rhythm on more than one occasion, it was impossible to ignore the real problem weighing on his mind. \nYuuri\u2019s soulmate hadn\u2019t initiated any contact past their Let\u2019s try again, written in shaky Russian that Yuuri had to spend a little while poring over his dictionary to translate. His heart twinges at the memory, thinking back to how his soulmate\u2019s penmanship could have been a good indicator of their emotions. Had their hand been shaky from relief, like Yuuri\u2019s had been? Yuuri glances at his bare hands one last time before tugging his gloves back on.\nIf there was one thing Yuuri had to admit, it was that he was definitely bad at facing his problems head on. If one hoped to avoid calls by stuffing their phone out of sight and on vibrate, Yuuri covered his hands with his figure skating gloves most of the time now, and even avoided keeping a pen on his person unless he really needed it. \nWhat was he hoping? That his soulmate would write something, and it\u2019d wash or rub off before Yuuri could possibly see it? Or that Yuuri would see it, but not have anything to write back with? Yuuri gloomily stares at Viktor\u2019s back as his coach led the way back to the Yu-topia on his bike. He shouldn\u2019t be doing this, and Yuuri admonishes himself soundly, because doing that\u2026 wouldn\u2019t that just make things worse? \nThe sudden squeak of the bike brakes rouses Yuuri from his stupor, and he plants his feet just in time to stop himself from crashing straight into Viktor\u2019s bike.\n\u201cThe moon looks pretty over the water tonight, Yuuri!\u201d Viktor says, blissfully unaware of his pupil\u2019s inner turmoil. \n\u201cMhm,\u201d Yuuri says noncommittally, squatting down to wrap his arms around Makkachin. The dog eagerly laps at Yuuri\u2019s face, both their breaths combining into one cloud in the cool night air. He lets out the smallest of sighs and buries his gloved hands in the poodle\u2019s soft fur, desperately missing Vicchan more than ever. \nSuddenly, Yuuri feels a hand on his own head, and he looks up, startled. Viktor grins down at him before roughly mussing his hair, and Yuuri lets out an undignified squawk. \u201cHey\u2014!\u201d\n\u201cYou landed one in practice, but are you nervous about landing it in competition?\u201d Viktor says, and Yuuri realizes that Viktor has noticed his silence. Viktor continues to gently mess with Yuuri, bopping his head around like a bobble head as he continues to try to guess. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re missing your pork cutlet bowls? I did tell you that you\u2019re going to win, so you\u2019ve just got to work hard and be patient!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Yuuri begins hesitantly, and Viktor settles down next to him, reaching around Yuuri to pat at Makkachin as well. \n\u201cIs it stress?\u201d Viktor guesses again, glancing at Yuuri. \nRather than admitting his real worries, Yuuri opts to nod instead. It wasn\u2019t really a lie, anyway. \n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Viktor says slowly, \u201cif there\u2019s anything I can do to help, you\u2019ve just got to tell me. I\u2019m very good at these advice things, you know.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Yuuri replies, feeling the smallest of smiles begin to turn up the corners of his mouth. \u201cOkay. I believe you.\u201d\nViktor gives him a sidelong glance, mirroring his small grin. \u201cOh? You don\u2019t sound so sure though?\u201d In one swoop, Viktor has Yuuri\u2019s hands in his own, and Yuuri reels at finding himself eye to eye with Viktor again, with only the barest of distances between them. \n\u201cI\u2019m here for you,\u201d Viktor says seriously, looking so solemn that Yuuri almost feels ridiculous for turning red this time, \u201cand it\u2019s my duty as a friend and coach to make sure nothing\u2019s bothering you, Yuuri.\u201d\n\u201cT-thank you,\u201d Yuuri replies, feeling like his head was spinning. \u201cUm\u2026 you can let go now.\u201d\nViktor does let go\u2026 of one of Yuuri\u2019s hands, leaving Yuuri\u2019s other hand entwined with Viktor\u2019s left as his coach settles down into a more comfortable sitting position. \u201cI find that the best way to relax is to just listen to the ocean waves sometimes,\u201d Viktor says, looking completely at ease with having Yuuri\u2019s hand in his, even as the former struggles to form a single coherent sentence. \n\u201cYou know,\u201d Viktor continues, hardly ruffled, \u201cthe closer we become, the more I\u2019ll be able to understand how you skate.\u201d\n\u201cI guess\u2026 that there is some logic to that,\u201d Yuuri says, flustered. \n\u201cBut it\u2019s true! A coach should understand every inch of their trainee, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nEvery inch? \u201cI-in a sense,\u201d Yuuri stammers.\nViktor hums, and his fingers tighten around Yuuri\u2019s. \u201cDidn\u2019t your previous coach spend time getting to know what makes up Yuuri? Besides the pork cutlet bowls?\u201d\nYuuri sits back, stretching his legs out before him in a more comfortable position. He gives an experimental tug against Viktor\u2019s hand, and is surprised when Viktor lets his fingers begin to slip out easily\u2014Yuuri stops then, letting the tips of his fingers rest against Viktor\u2019s palm even as his face burns. Bonding, right?\n\u201cI-I guess we did, kind of,\u201d Yuuri says when it\u2019s apparent that Viktor is waiting for an answer. \u201cHe did get kind of busy outside of training, and I guess we were only ever really able to \u2018bond\u2019 on competition trips. I don\u2019t know if that counts, though.\u201d\n\u201cIt could,\u201d Viktor acquiesces, and smiles as he watches Makkachin stand to settle himself back down in between Yuuri\u2019s legs, pressing a fluffy head against the younger man\u2019s chest. \u201cThough I\u2019m hoping by the time competitions roll around, I\u2019ll have a better understanding of how you skate, Yuuri.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut anyway, I\u2019m your coach now,\u201d Viktor says, preening, and Yuuri cocks his head to the side bemusedly. \u201cMy methods are different, and I hope that you\u2019re ready to handle it, now that you\u2019re mine.\u201d Viktor\u2019s eyes slide to the side to gauge Yuuri\u2019s reaction, only to look delightedly satisfied to see that Yuuri has blushed himself into silence. Again.\nIt suddenly hits Yuuri that he and Viktor are sitting on a sidewalk overlooking a beach at night, lit only by the soft light of the moon. No one else is in sight, and everything about the situation feels strangely\u2026 intimate. \nYuuri all but flings himself up into a standing position, and Makkachin lets out an upset whine at losing the warmth. Even Viktor looks slightly downcast, but smiles when Yuuri looks back down at him.\n\u201cWe should go! The ramen place might close soon!\u201d Yuuri says, trying his absolute best not to start stammering. Viktor hums in agreement, slowly raising himself back up. \n\u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m certainly hungry!\u201d\nYuuri keeps his eyes on his shoes as they continue walking, the only sound being the step of their shoes against concrete and Viktor\u2019s voice as he recounts some foods that Yuuri \u201creally ought to try someday in Russia\u201d. \nWith as flustered as Viktor made him, Yuuri had to admit that he could definitely grow to enjoy having Viktor\u2019s time all to himself. It was a little selfish but\u2026 for years, he\u2019d only been able to watch Viktor through some sort of screen, wondering what the man could be like in person. And now that Yuuri knew what Viktor was like\u2026 well, Viktor was certainly much more cheerful than Yuuri could have probably imagined, but he was still enchanted anyway. And still, he should have expected it\u2014aside from his talent, Viktor\u2019s charisma was what made him popular even among the most casual of figure skating fans. \nYuuri glances at his coach, smiling when he finds Viktor still recounting the best restaurants in Russia. Yes, Yuuri certainly was lucky.\nYuuri idly watches his breath make tiny clouds in the air as he listens with half an ear to Viktor\u2019s spiel, feeling his stomach suddenly twist itself into knots. If his time with Viktor was some of the best hours of his day, then the nights were some of his toughest. The worry and the want for success, coupled with the unwelcome (and sudden) memories of every one of his past failures\u2026 Yuuri rubs at his eyes irritably, feeling the eye bags more than ever. Not to mention the issue with his soulmate. Was it even an issue?\n\u201cDo you like fish? Oh, what am I saying, of course you do! You won\u2019t have a problem with the smoked salmon at this place, but I want you to try our borscht, I want to see what you\u2019d think of it\u2026 Also, at dinner you\u2019ll have to let me know what foods you like! You\u2019ve already introduced me to the wonder of pork cutlet bowls!\u201d Yuuri is brought back to Viktor\u2019s food talk by the arm around his shoulders, and he leans in a little despite himself, grateful for the warmth. \nIf his soulmate was the terrifying unknown, Yuuri could probably consider Viktor as the one who grounded him and kept him steady.\n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy, Yuuri, your soulmate certainly is bold!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Yuuri says, looking up blankly from his shoes. It\u2019s the morning after his first day of practice, and his muscles still ache from the intensity of the day before. Viktor lounges against the doorway, thumbing through his phone and amicably patting Makkachin on his head as they both wait for Yuuri to finish putting his shoes on. \nHis mother leans down to point in the general direction of Yuuri\u2019s neck, pressing a hand against her cheek cheerfully. \u201cNormally I wouldn\u2019t nose my way into things, but at this rate it would have washed off without you even noticing! Right there, on the back of your neck, there\u2019s a little heart!\u201d\nYuuri\u2019s face flames, and he slaps a hand to cover the nape of his neck as his eyes automatically swing to Viktor to gauge his reaction. Oddly enough, his coach has his mouth covered with a gloved hand, looking intently at the screen of his phone as if it held all the secrets of the figure skating world. Who knows\u2014with Viktor, it probably did. Yuuri\u2019s just grateful he doesn\u2019t seem to be paying much attention, and he turns to his mother with a sheepish look. \n\u201cWell, well, don\u2019t worry, your father did much of the same when we were younger! Still does, I find the surprises to be the sweetest thing!\u201d His mother giggles as she bustles off, leaving Yuuri torn between feeling slightly embarrassed at the information, and glad his parents were still as sickly sweet as ever. \u201cStill, how bold!\u201d\nYuuri watches her leave before letting his eyes slide back to Viktor, who had finally lifted his eyes away from his phone. When their eyes meet, Viktor merely smiles before turning on his heel and sliding the door of the onsen open. \u201cCome, boys, we have work to do!\u201d\nYuuri gives a final half-hearted tug on his shoelaces before standing, and by then, Viktor and Makkachin have already darted out the front doors. Yuuri stalls for a bit longer, pressing a hand to the back of his neck. A heart\u2026? Yuuri gently rubs at marks he can\u2019t see with an index finger, before bringing it back up to his eyes. He does find the smallest of smudges of ink on the tip of his finger, and he fights down another blush. Neither of them had initiated contact for a couple of days now, but maybe this was his soulmate\u2019s way of leaving a reassuring message? They were probably busy, after all. But why put it somewhere where Yuuri wouldn\u2019t have been able to see?\nYuuri finds himself keeping pace with Viktor\u2019s bike this time, but just barely. In between heavy panting, Yuuri sneaks glances at his idol, still excited even with it being the second day. Viktor has that congenial smile on his face again, and his ears and nose are red in the morning cold. Or at least Yuuri thinks it\u2019s the cold\u2014all he can feel is his own body heat, especially the longer he runs. \n\u201cHot, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Viktor says when his bike squeaks to a stop, and Yuuri lets out one final puff of air in relief at the sight of the ice rink. \n\u201cOh\u2026 I thought it was a little chilly,\u201d Yuuri pants, looking at Viktor from where he was doubled over. \u201cYour\u2026 ears are a little red.\u201d\nViktor\u2019s eyes widen, one hand flying up to an ear. \u201cAh, yes\u2014chilly! The heat I\u2019m feeling must be from your shining enthusiasm, Yuuri,\u201d his coach says, but for some reason it sounds more half hearted than usual. Viktor sighs as Yuuri stretches in place, raising his own arms in a stretch above him. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone would notice my writing\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Yuuri quirks his head, barely able to hear Viktor past his own accelerated heart rate. Seriously, he hated running. \u201cSorry, what was that?\u201d\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Viktor replies cheerfully. \u201cNow come on, Aeroflot!\u201d\n\u201cViktor!\u201d Yuuri protests, even as he trails after the former. His coach beams at him, and Yuuri accepts the arm around his shoulder with only the barest of blushes. He even gives himself a mental pat on the back\u2014if Viktor\u2019s way of showing affection was through friendly touches, Yuuri can get used to that, right?\n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\nWrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong.\nYuuri was about to combust. \n\u201cYuuri!\u201d Viktor says innocently at dinnertime, flopping down next to the younger man with a hand warm on Yuuri\u2019s thigh. It\u2019s suddenly as if their shoulders are glued together, and when Yuuri\u2019s mouth drops open despite himself, Viktor takes the opportunity to gently press a serving of rice into his mouth. \n\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor coos in the hot springs bath, tugging Yuuri close with the excuse of helping him stretch out after a tiring day of training. Oddly enough, they have an audience again, and an old man seems to really like praying through the glass doors of the hot springs, it seems. \n\u201cYuuri?\u201d Viktor asks, before asking if they could watch a movie together, and they spend ninety percent of it talking about anything other than the movie playing in front of them. Which is nice, Yuuri thinks, and then his brain short circuits when Viktor falls asleep and his head lands on Yuuri\u2019s shoulder. He doesn\u2019t want to move and wake his coach up, so eventually Yuuri falls asleep too, and wakes up with mouthful of fur (courtesy of Makkachin), a crick in his neck, and an armful of a snoozing Viktor Nikiforov.\n\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor says thoughtfully, and brings Yuuri closer in order to tilt his chin up and examine Yuuri\u2019s face. Wouldn\u2019t Yuuri look good with eyeliner? Yuuri vehemently protests, and Viktor sighs, letting his hand slide against Yuuri\u2019s cheek before he finally steps back. \n\u201cYuuri!\u201d Viktor whines when Yuuri attempts to roll his coach off his bed. No, they could not sleep together again and yes, Yuuri was sure. Still, Viktor playfully pins Yuuri to the bed again, messing with his hair in a repeat of the night of the Hot Springs on Ice. Yuuri would look better bald, after all! Maybe Viktor should shave it for him right now. Yuuri wails in faux terror, but his succeeding laughter subsides when he catches Viktor staring solemnly at him. \n\u201cYuuri\u2026\u201d Viktor says right after that, voice low, and thumbs at Yuuri\u2019s bottom lip. \u201cGood night.\u201d\n\nYuuri. Yuuri? Yuuri!\n\n\u201cWhat is happening.\u201d Yuuri whacks his head on his desk in exasperation, but does it a little too hard, and regrets each and every little star he thinks he sees spinning around his head. Was it possible to get sick of your own name? Probably not with they way it sounded in Viktor\u2019s voice. What was going on with him anyway?\n\u201cHe\u2019s on a whole other level of skin ship,\u201d Yuuri groans into his desk, tapping a finger against the wood. Makkachin whines from his bed, and Yuuri\u2019s head lifts up to regard the poodle, flicking back towards his doorway apprehensively. \u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t be in here,\u201d Yuuri tells the dog regretfully. \u201cViktor might come in looking for you.\u201d\nMakkachin only barks at this as if affronted, and Yuuri hastily presses a finger against his lips to silence him. \u201cMakkachin! Shh!\u201d\nThe wood of his chair creaks as he lifts himself up to walk the few steps toward his bed. Makkachin only lets out a contented huff when Yuuri flops face first into soft fur, scratching behind one of Makkachin\u2019s ears. He probably shouldn\u2019t\u2014his hair is still wet from his bath earlier, and he\u2019s bound to end up having poodle fur stuck to his hair at this rate. But Makkachin is so comfy, and he reminds Yuuri of Vicchan. \u201cMakkachin, is Viktor normally like this?\u201d\nMakkachin sneezes. \n\u201cI see,\u201d Yuuri says seriously. \u201cSo he\u2019s normally like this. I mean, there\u2019s nothing wrong with it, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s something he needs to stop\u2026\u201d Makkachin turns to look at Yuuri, giving him a long lick on the side of his face. \u201cOh, maybe you\u2019re right! It\u2019s probably weird! But is it bad if I said\u2026 that I kind of liked it?\u201d Yuuri sobers, sitting upright on his bed and allowing Makkachin to scramble onto his lap like some kind of oversized lap dog. \u201cI\u2019ve never been this close with someone before, and I really like his company\u2026\u201d\nThen what\u2019s the problem? Makkachin\u2019s head tilt seems to say. That, or he\u2019s wondering why Yuuri has stopped scratching him behind the ear.\n\u201cThe problem,\u201d Yuuri murmurs as he resumes his petting, \u201cis that we both have soulmates to think about.\u201d\nYuuri buries his face in fur again, and Makkachin sighs, disgruntled that the petting has stopped yet again. \nWhat was Viktor\u2019s soulmate like? Yuuri turns to press his cheek into Makkachin\u2019s neck, letting the curls of fur tickle at his nose. I bet they\u2019re gorgeous, Yuuri thinks. Anyone who has Viktor has a soulmate is probably amazing. Anyone who has Viktor is incredibly lucky\u2026\nHe stays there for a few beats until he can\u2019t hold his breath any longer, and Yuuri gently sets Makkachin to the side in order to walk over to his desk for a pen. \nRidiculously enough, Yuuri\u2019s hands are shaking, and he clenches and unclenches them before finally uncapping the pen. He\u2019s torn\u2014but even with all the turmoil he\u2019d been putting himself through, he had to admit that he had to spend more time focusing on his soulmate, rather than\u2026 Yuuri shakes his head roughly. \nHello, he writes. How are you? \nYuuri hears footsteps approaching his room, and he glances up, fully expecting Viktor to waltz in. However, they stop abruptly, before beginning again and fading back away. Yuuri tilts his head quizzically, but it had probably just been one of his family members\u2026 \nHe shrugs and turns back to his hand, only to freeze. His characters had been abruptly scrubbed off, only the barest of gray shadows left behind from the ink. Yuuri\u2019s mind immediately goes into overdrive, and he makes sure to check every inch of himself for any possible reply. Why\u2014why had they\u2014why did his soulmate erase his words without\u2014\nYuuri reaches for his pen again, fully intending on writing another shaky greeting, when his door slides open, the back of it clicking loudly against the wall. Yuuri swings around, barely able to see Viktor through the tears in his eyes, and his coach freezes, his ready smile plastered onto his face almost comedically. It melts off an instant later, and Viktor looks absolutely shocked.\n\u201cYuuri?\u201d\n\u201cV-Viktor,\u201d Yuuri whispers, mortified. He quickly rubs away at his eyes, turning away. \u201cSorry, this really isn\u2019t the best of times.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Out of the corner of his eye, Yuuri sees Viktor\u2019s eyes flick towards Yuuri\u2019s left hand, wiping away at a stray tear, and his face seems to blanch. \u201cYuuri?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Yuuri pauses, at a loss for words. Why was he crying? Was it even worth crying over? There could actually be a plausible reason for his words being wiped off almost as soon as he wrote them, and communication between the two had been difficult in the first place.\nBut that\u2019s why I thought every interaction was so precious, Yuuri thinks, feeling fresh tears well up in his eyes. \n\u201cYuuri\u2014\u201c\n\u201cNo, Viktor!\u201d Yuuri snaps\u2014then freezes. He and Viktor stare at each other in varying levels of shock, then Yuuri feels as if his tears have suddenly dried up thanks to the horror he suddenly feels. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d\nViktor looks down, pursing his lips. When he looks up, there\u2019s a steely look in his eye, as if he\u2019s decided something, and he motions for Yuuri to come and sit with him on the bed. Yuuri sniffles a little, but complies, and Makkachin hops onto the floor in order to accommodate the two. \n\u201cIs it anything I can help with?\u201d Viktor asks solemnly, placing a reassuring hand on Yuuri\u2019s shoulder. Yuuri shakes his head.\n\u201cNo\u2026 sorry\u2026 right now I don\u2019t really want to talk about it.\u201d\n\u201cWe can talk about something else then. Also, if you want to relax, will you let me comb out your hair?\u201d Viktor clicks his tongue gently, lifting up a damp strand of Yuuri\u2019s hair. \u201cYou can\u2019t sleep like this\u2014also, you have some fur in it.\u201d\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d Yuuri says, laughing wetly. Viktor looks almost sad as his hand comes up to wipe away the last of Yuuri\u2019s tears, and Yuuri blushes. \u201cSorry, I know I always tend to cry\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d Viktor says soothingly. \u201cCan you come and sit on the floor? Grab a cushion if it isn\u2019t comfortable. And do you have a comb?\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Yuuri roots around for it, and hands it over to Viktor as he settles himself in front of his coach. \u201cIt\u2019s a little embarrassing\u2026 I\u2019m just lucky you didn\u2019t see me at my worst. This is nothing compared to my reaction after\u2026 the previous Grand Prix\u2026\u201d\n\u201cEmotions aren\u2019t something you disregard easily,\u201d Viktor retorts, injecting a smaller dose of his enthusiasm back into his words. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with showing your emotions easily.\u201d\n\u201cEmbarrassing still,\u201d Yuuri mumbles, already more relaxed at the glide of the comb through his hair. \n\u201cWell, whatever it was, just know that every problem has a solution,\u201d Viktor says cheerfully, and he gives one reassuring tug at Yuuri\u2019s ear. \u201cIt might take time, but nothing lasts forever.\u201d\nYuuri hums, his eyes cracking open to stare at the low light of his desk lamp. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cI know I am.\u201d Viktor pauses, a hand brushing Yuuri\u2019s neck by accident, and Yuuri shudders lightly. \u201cAt least in this regard. I\u2019m sorry, Yuuri.\u201d\n\u201cHm? For what?\u201d Yuuri\u2019s eyes close again, and he leans back into Viktor\u2019s touch. \nA camera shutter goes off, and Viktor\u2019s hand pauses from where it slides against Yuuri\u2019s hair. A pitched giggle erupts in response to two other voices hissing in reprimand. \n\u201cThe triplets,\u201d Yuuri says loudly, one eye sliding open to regard the cracked doorway, \u201care visiting today while their parents have a date night. But they really should be asleep by now.\u201d\nThe giggling only grows louder, and the door snaps shut soon afterwards, the sound of three pairs of rapid feet pattering away. \n\u201cYou would think they would know to mute the phone, at least,\u201d Viktor says lazily, resuming his task of combing through Yuuri\u2019s hair. Yuuri merely hums in response, letting himself sink back into relaxation.\n\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor says, and Yuuri\u2019s eyes open again at the low urgency he thinks he hears laced in Viktor\u2019s voice. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\nYuuri yelps when he feels Viktor\u2019s arms pick him up off the floor to pull him straight back into Viktor\u2019s lap, and his face burns at the feel of Viktor\u2019s face burying into the back of his neck. \u201cViktor\u2014?\u201d The comb clatters loudly onto the floor. \n\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor whispers. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you cry.\u201d\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t,\u201d Yuuri says, squirming. His face feels uncomfortably hot, and he can feel the warmth of Viktor\u2019s breath tickling the hairs at the nape of his neck. Viktor sighs, only making it worse. \u201cHey!\u201d\nYuuri yelps loudly when he feels Viktor\u2019s lips at the side of his neck, and he scrambles forward and out of Viktor\u2019s grasp to fall flat onto the floor. \u201cWhat are\u2014what was that!\u201d\n\u201cYuuri\u2014\u201c\n\u201cNo, nonono,\u201d Yuuri says in garbled English, face aflame. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to do that. You can\u2019t! Don\u2019t you care that you have a soulmate?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Viktor says seriously.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think they\u2019d mind? If they found out?\u201d\nAt that, the corner of Viktor\u2019s mouth seems to twitch. \u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\u201cHey, stop smiling,\u201d Yuuri scolds firmly, and Viktor\u2019s tiny half smile falls as he nods back seriously. \u201cOh my god, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d\nViktor manages to contain himself for one second before blurting out, \u201ccrazy about you.\u201d\nYuuri groans, burying his face in his hands. \u201cI can\u2019t do this\u2026 I know that you know that I\u2019m attracted to you, I guess it\u2019s been obvious, but I can\u2019t allow myself to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou are? Yuuri,\u201d Viktor says again, gently tugging at Yuuri\u2019s arm. \u201cPlease.\u201d There\u2019s a click of a pen uncapping, and Yuuri blinks up at Viktor confusedly. He only gets a second to register a pen in Viktor\u2019s hand before he\u2019s tugged forward and onto Viktor\u2019s lap, all but falling against the other man\u2019s chest.\n\u201cHey, hey!\u201d Yuuri gasps as Viktor quickly tilts his chin up. The tip of the marker is cold against his upper lip, and Yuuri freezes in shock. \u201cYou\u2014purple?\u201d\nAnd Yuuri watches, shocked, as a swooping purple mustache appears on Viktor\u2019s face, outlining his idol\u2019s ridiculously shit-eating grin. \n\u201cSurprise!\u201d Viktor says as he doodles a heart onto Yuuri\u2019s cheek\u2014and Yuuri knows that it\u2019s a heart because he can see its exact copy popping up right under Viktor\u2019s eye. Purple. Ridiculous.\n\u201cI only found out recently, I promise. Days ago?\u201d Viktor begins, the purple mustache bobbing up and down ridiculously. \u201cI only meant to wait until I could make you focus only on me\u2014I wanted you to like me for me, rather than through some sort of\u2026 oh, Yuuri,\u201d Viktor breaks off, distressed. \u201cPlease don\u2019t cry!\u201d\n\u201cYou asshole!\u201d Yuuri wails, hardly caring that he\u2019s using an expletive against his idol for the first time in absolutely forever. \u201cI was dying over my feelings for you and my soulmate, and you\u2019ve known that you were both for days?\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Dying\u2019 is a strong word,\u201d Viktor says mildly, pulling Yuuri further onto his lap. Yuuri hardly has the strength to resist, as weak-kneed as he\u2019s become, and he can only push against Viktor\u2019s chest with limp arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\n\u201cH-how did you\u2026 when did you\u2014\u201c\n\u201cWhen we were having breakfast, and you showed me your hand,\u201d Viktor admits sheepishly, and Yuuri glares furiously through a fresh wave of stunned tears. \n\u201cI should just leave you, right now,\u201d Yuuri says seriously, and Viktor shakes his head, burying his face in the crook of Yuuri\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLucky for you, I\u2019ve been waiting for you for forever.\u201d\n\u201cLucky,\u201d Viktor echoes in agreement, and his head moves up to press warm lips against the side of Yuuri\u2019s neck. \n\u201cViktor,\u201d Yuuri whispers, feeling absolutely stricken. \u201cWhy did you make me wait? You\u2019re mine? You\u2019re really mine?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Viktor murmurs, nosing at Yuuri\u2019s jawline. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou should have told me,\u201d Yuuri cries. Viktor tightens his arms around Yuuri, gathering him close. \n\u201cI know\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to work on that forgiveness,\u201d Yuuri says, trying to sound furious through his sniffling. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to\u2026 I don\u2019t want to have to wait for you any longer.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it make you happy? That I\u2019m your soulmate?\u201d Viktor murmurs, finally looking up, and Yuuri can\u2019t help but snort at the now-smudged purple mustache. \n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 the mustache is distracting me.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Viktor swipes at his thumb with his tongue and begins to rub at Yuuri\u2019s upper lip. Yuuri blushes when Viktor deliberately presses his thumb against Yuuri\u2019s lips, eyes half lidded as he comes closer still. \nHe wipes away at the heart under Yuuri\u2019s eye too, and Yuuri watches, amazed, as it rubs off of Viktor\u2019s face as well. \n\u201cI\u2019ve never\u2026 seen it before,\u201d Yuuri whispers. \u201cSo that heart at the back of my neck, that was you?\u201d\n\u201cAnd all of the other times before,\u201d Viktor says as he hands Yuuri the marker. \u201cI wanted to surprise you and make it a happy occasion, but part of me wanted to make sure you only had me on your mind.\u201d \nYuuri watches, mesmerized, as the line he draws down Viktor\u2019s left forearm appears on his own. It makes him think back to junior high and tic-tac-toe boards. \u201cI made you wait for so long,\u201d Yuuri realizes suddenly. \nViktor sighs and leans forward to touch noses with Yuuri, smiling when the younger man\u2019s eyes flick up to meet his. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know, then. Besides, anyone would be nervous if their soulmate was writing in an entirely different language.\u201d\n\u201cWe could have written in English,\u201d Yuuri murmurs, allowing himself to a relax a little in Viktor\u2019s hold. \u201cI went to Detroit for a few years, I could have written\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we were both scared to seek out alternatives,\u201d Viktor suggests, and Yuuri startles a little at the feel of Viktor\u2019s lips brushing against his cheeks. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect if we ever did meet.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about now? Are you\u2026 were you happy when you found out it was me? Or did you wait a little while longer because\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor interrupts, leaning back. \u201cI came to Japan for you. Your video, your skating\u2014I might have thought you were interesting, but the more time I spent with you, I thought you were amazing.\u201d Viktor smiles, rubbing Yuuri\u2019s tearstained cheek. \u201cI was so happy when I realized you were mine. I took it a little too far, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cThe confusion was difficult,\u201d Yuuri admits, voice low, and Viktor presses their foreheads together as he links his hands behind Yuuri\u2019s back. \n\u201cIt was stupid to wait as long as I did,\u201d Viktor replies, smiling, and Yuuri finally feels the beginnings of a smile start to lift the corner of his lips. \u201cAh, Yuuri.\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019m dreaming,\u201d Yuuri interjects seriously, and Viktor laughs delightedly. \n\u201cThat would make me the man of your dreams! Such high praise, I can tell you\u2019re already going to spoil me.\u201d One of Viktor\u2019s hands comes up to press against the back of Yuuri\u2019s head, tugging him closer and closer. \u201cI think if this was a dream, I\u2019d never want to wake up.\u201d\nYuuri can\u2019t help it\u2014he whimpers when Viktor\u2019s lips finally press against his, and its all he can do to keep his hands clenched around the fabric of Viktor\u2019s robe. Viktor, however, kisses just as how Yuuri would have expected him to; all skill and heated passion. \nViktor only relents when Yuuri begins to struggle for air, and even then Yuuri\u2019s soulmate (his soulmate!) moves to press kisses all over Yuuri\u2019s face. Yuuri barely gets his breath back when Viktor renews his assault, enthusiastically tugging Yuuri closer until Yuuri\u2019s chest is pressing against his. \nIt\u2019s almost too much for Yuuri\u2014he feels himself arching backwards under Viktor\u2019s eagerness, and links his hands together behind Viktor\u2019s neck for purchase. He\u2019s never kissed anyone like this in his life, and he almost thinks he might faint from the entire situation. It\u2019s almost how ridiculous how safe Yuuri feels. He\u2019s basically straddling Viktor as the latter bends forward until only Viktor\u2019s arms keep Yuuri from falling onto the floor, and still Yuuri receives kiss after kiss. \nHe makes the mistake\u2014or maybe it was a good thing\u2014of letting his lips crack open for air in the middle of another kiss, and Viktor takes the opportunity to deepen it. It\u2019s embarrassing, but Yuuri lets out a high whimper at the feeling, and Viktor\u2019s hand strokes the back of his head soothingly. \n\u201cViktor,\u201d Yuuri whispers when he\u2019s finally able to break free, and Viktor hums from where he\u2019s buried his face in the crook of Yuuri\u2019s neck. A nip has Yuuri squirming, and Viktor lets out a soft laugh. \u201cWait\u2026\u201d\nYuuri blinks gratefully when Viktor raises them back up into an upright sitting position, and his soulmate brushes away at Yuuri\u2019s bangs. \u201cMm?\u201d\n\u201cI think\u2026 maybe we need to slow down,\u201d Yuuri says sheepishly, and Viktor smiles gently, eyes sweeping adoringly over Yuuri\u2019s flushed face.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d his soulmate says in English, pressing an innocent kiss to Yuuri\u2019s cheek. \u201cWhatever you\u2019d like.\u201d\nYuuri blushes when his eyes slide down to find that Viktor\u2019s robe has fallen again, baring one shoulder. Viktor\u2019s eyes follow Yuuri\u2019s almost lazily, watching as Yuuri picks up the marker again and draws an unsteady looking heart on the pale skin there. With a mischievous smile, Viktor reaches up to tug down the collar of Yuuri\u2019s own shirt, and both of them marvel at the sight of an identical heart. \n\u201cI doubt this will ever get old,\u201d Viktor says, pressing a kiss to Yuuri\u2019s shoulder, and Yuuri nods in agreement, his eyes sliding shut. Viktor\u2019s breath flutters against Yuuri\u2019s cheek, and his eyes open to find Viktor staring right back.\n\u201cOne more kiss?\u201d Viktor asks, smiling. \u201cI know we have to go to dinner soon.\u201d\nYuuri looks down and watches the rise and fall of Viktor\u2019s chest, slowly raising his eyes back up to peek at a gently smiling Viktor. \u201cMhm.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d his soulmate repeats, voice low, his right hand coming back up to cup the back of Yuuri\u2019s neck. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m so lucky, Yuuri.\u201d\nYuuri gets soundly kissed before he can even begin to reply, but as he drops the marker again to finally allow his hands to feel just how soft Viktor\u2019s hair was, he couldn\u2019t help but think that he had to be the lucky one to be able to have Viktor as his soulmate.\nWhen Yurio is granted one of his few rare breaks of the day, he doesn\u2019t expect it to be spent agonizing over the two people he really should not be thinking about. At all. (Or so he tells himself.)\nHe can\u2019t help it\u2014every ping of a notification from his phone has him near violently snatching it up, ready to be relieved of this guilt, only to frustratedly chuck it aside after seeing just another useless text message.\nYuri shouldn\u2019t care, he really shouldn\u2019t. \nHe\u2019d left Japan after the Hot Springs on Ice suddenly and without another word to Viktor or Yuuri, because the sight of them so grossly overjoyed was too much for his stomach to handle. (Or too much for his \u201cteenage angst to process\u201d, as Mila put it. He had childishly spat at her, then spent the next five minutes being tossed unceremoniously in the air.) \nBut even his abrupt departure and the ensuing feelings of beat-the-Japanese-piggy-into-the-dust did nothing to curb the beginning stirrings of guilt that had occurred over the next few days.\nYuri wasn\u2019t heartless. He knew just as well as anyone the importance of soulmates, even if his own feelings towards the topic was complicated at best. And Yuri had just left without another word, fully expecting the two idiots to figure it out in no time. After all, living together? Training together 24/7? As much as it soured Yuri\u2019s mouth to think about it, he had to grant them that, didn\u2019t he? And Viktor had to have figured it out by now\u2014even with the older man\u2019s forgetfulness (Yuri grounds his skates into the ice), Viktor should have at least begun to realize that he was already breathing the same air as his damn soulmate. Maybe four eyes got the hint already too. And they were even going to meet their \u201csoulmate\u201d somewhere the day after the competition. There was no way for them to mess that up, was there? \nYet when Yuri touched down in Russia and threw himself into practice\u2014with great spurring from Yakov\u2019s terrifying ex-wife\u2014he allowed himself to keep the tiniest bit of attention to his phone for a notification from Viktor. Or a news article. Anything, really. Viktor was one of the most flamboyant people Yuri knew\u2026 If Viktor had found out already, he would have had to blab about it to someone by now. He would have only had to tell one or two people for it to spread like wildfire through every news outlet on every inch of the globe.\nAnd yet\u2026 nothing.\nIt\u2019s been days, and Yuri is torn between a mix of smug satisfaction at the expense of two idiots, and guilt at having not at least told someone. \nYuri scowls. But really\u2014it\u2019s Not His Problem. Yuri pauses then to lean up against the ice rink\u2019s barrier, furrowing his brows in thought. But maybe if Yuuko knew, then she\u2019d be able to hint it to them\u2026 or at least tell Yuri if the two idiots had already \u201cmet\u201d each other for the second time\u2026 \nNo. Yuri shakes his head before reaching up to pull back his hair into a sloppy half pony tail. No, that was one step too far, but\u2026 it was such an important topic\u2026\nUnbeknownst to Yuri, Yakov shoots him a confused look as the coach skates by to talk to Mila, looking worriedly at his youngest skater as Yuri agitatedly slams the blade of his right boot into the ice repeatedly. \nLilia looks up from her clipboard, narrowing green eyes behind her glasses. \u201cYuri. If you insist on spending your break vandalizing the rink, should we end it early and have you go straight back to work?\u201d\nYuri straightens up in a most military-like fashion, arms at his sides. \u201cSorry!\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d Lilia turns away again to pore over her notes, and Yuri lets the tension bleed from his muscles. \nThis had to come to an end. The only way Yuri should even be thinking about piggy-Yuri was in terms of crushing him in competition, not agonizing over his damned love life. Yuri pulls out his phone again, checking the time to confirm he had a few more minutes of free time left, before pulling up a new message to Viktor.\n\nOi, Viktor. Did you meet them?? Have you found out who your soulmate is yet???\n\nYuri pushes it into his pocket almost violently, stretching his arms over his head in an attempt to loosen up. Five seconds later, he whips out his phone again. It\u2019s the Japanese Yuri, Yuri clarifies, wishing he had an iPhone so as to do that slam-effect thing that iMessage had. Anything at all to get the message across to the older man. Katsuki Yuri. That one.\nNow, Yuri hands his phone to an even more thoroughly confused and disgruntled Yakov before skating over to the side of the rink Lilia leaned on, still focused on her clipboard.\n\u201cReady,\u201d Yuri states clearly, meeting sharp green eyes. \u201cI\u2019d like to get back to practice, please.\u201d\nHe isn\u2019t let off until hours later, and when Yuri pulls out his phone, it\u2019s with slightly wobbling hands. Yuri is in the middle of a drink out of his water bottle when his bleary eyes register two replies from Viktor Nikiforov, and he spits it out onto the floor in front of him. (\u201cGross,\u201d Mila tells him, affronted.)\n\nYurio, are you psychic? Wowow, how did you know!\n\n\nI found out somehow the morning after Hot Springs on Ice! Yuuri has been soooo adorable, I can hardly stand it! Speaking of which, have you encompassed the meaning of Agape yet, Yurio?\n\nYuri nearly chucks his phone into the space in front of him and gets hoisted up by a furious Mila, thinking that he\u2019d meant to throw his offending piece of technology at her. (\u201cFirst you nearly spit water on my bag, then you assault me?\u201d \u201cI did not! Let me down, \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0430!!\u201d)\nHonestly, Yuri thinks as he straightens his clothes back into order. Those two were nothing but trouble. I\u2019m sorry I even tried to get involved, Yuri decides, feeling disgruntled. \n\u201cYuri,\u201d Yakov says roughly as he passes. \u201cWe\u2019re closing up, get ready to go home.\u201d\nYuri grunts in reply before shouldering his bag. He wouldn\u2019t say that he felt better, but\u2026 Yuri squeezes the strap of his backpack. Now, with the last of anything bothersome hanging over his head gone, he could focus one hundred percent on winning the Grand Prix.\nYuri steps out into the crisp air of the night, eyes skirting over the parking lot until his gaze falls on Yakov and Lilia, waiting by the car. A cold breeze hits his cheek, and he shivers, tucking his head down to his chest for warmth. At least, that\u2019s his excuse. Yuri lets his eyes slide down to his bare hands for one long second before wrenching them back up and stepping forward into the cold evening air. \n\nJust you wait.\n\n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\nYuuko inhales sharply when she opens Instagram one day, and a picture of Viktor and Yuuri pops up to sear at her eyes. It was cute. It was domestic. It was a photo of Viktor combing out Yuuri\u2019s hair, soft light from an off camera lamp gently illuminating the small smiles on both of their faces, and Yuuko was one hundred percent sure that this was one picture that was most definitely not taken with either of their permission. Especially judging from the soft intimacy of the photo.\nThat, and the photo was posted under her girls\u2019 Instagram account.\n\u201cAzel, Lutz, and Loop!\u201d Yuuko yowls, her phone slapping the kitchen table with a loud smack. She gives one second of thanks for her phone case before she\u2019s distracted by three different colors of pajama sets darting into the room, their owners looking anywhere but at their mother.\n\u201cWhat\u2014\u201c and Yuuko picks up her phone, \u201cis this?\u201d\n\u201cYuuri!\u201d all three of them pipe up, their cherubic faces finally swinging up to beam at their mother with faux innocence. \u201cAnd Viktor.\u201d\n\u201cYe-es,\u201d Yuuko says slowly. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you think that it\u2019s a little rude of you to post a picture like this?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Lutz interjects, her head tilting. \u201cThey\u2019re not dating. Besides, all the skating otaku will love it!\u201d\nYuuko opens her mouth to protest, before clamping it back shut. Sure, they weren\u2019t dating. They had different soulmates, didn\u2019t they? But\u2026\nYuuko glances at her girls one more time before picking up her phone to stare at the photo. Her eyes slide down from the screen to her wrist, where Nishigori had written Will be home soon an hour before. The chance that Viktor and Yuuri were soulmates was incredibly slim, right? But\u2026\n\u201cThey look good together,\u201d Yuuko muses, frowning slightly. \n\u201cThey do!\u201d the triplets chorus.\n\u201cWho do?\u201d\n\u201cPapa!\u201d\nNishigori wobbles a little under the onslaught of his daughters\u2019 affections, even as he sidles up to his wife to peek over her shoulder at her phone. \u201cHey, girls, you did it again, huh? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little much this time?\u201d\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t dating though,\u201d Yuuko says, a bland echo of her daughter\u2019s words. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t?\u201d Nishigori frowns. \u201cI know this might sound a little weird, but I always thought\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat they were soulmates?\u201d Yuuko turns incredulous eyes on her husband, who flushes lightly. \n\u201cWell, you never know! I mean, especially what with how often Yuuri had his hands covered in Russian when we were kids, and now a Russian comes out of nowhere? Granted, it\u2019s Viktor, but doesn\u2019t that just make even more sense?\u201d\nYuuko stares slack-jawed at her husband, slowly processing the possibilities. \n\u201cOh, my gosh.\u201d Nishigori reaches up and gently closes Yuuko\u2019s mouth with a finger, and she swats at him absently. \u201cOh, my gosh! They could be soulmates! Do you think they know? Oh, of course they have to know, I bet they knew from the very beginning!\u201d\n\u201cHey, wait,\u201d Nishigori says hastily. \u201cI said it was just a thought because it kind of  made sense. Don\u2019t get any weird ideas into your head now\u2014\u201c\n\u201cWe\u2019re going over there for dinner,\u201d Yuuko says firmly, already punching in Yuuri\u2019s number into her phone. Her daughters whoop delightedly, drowning out Nishigori\u2019s sigh.\n\u201cJust don\u2019t assume, okay?\u201d Nishigori hedges, and Yuuko smiles at him.\n\u201cI\u2019m not, I\u2019m not\u2026 it\u2019s just that, what if? You know? I just want Yuuri to be happy, and so\u2026 But I promise I won\u2019t say anything to them, I just want to maybe watch them a little and see if\u2014ah, hello? Yuuri! I was just wondering if\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou girls make a lot of things happen, don\u2019t you,\u201d Nishigori says thoughtfully to his girls, and they beam up at him with identical smiles of pure innocence.\n\u201cIf you say so, papa!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\nYuuko leans into her husband to subtly whisper in his ear, feeling distinctly uncomfortable. \u201cI think that this was a bad idea.\u201d\n\u201cYou think?\u201d Nishigori hisses out of the corner of his mouth. \u201cGirls! Put your phones away, no pictures!\u201d\n\u201cYuuri,\u201d coos Viktor, leaning into Yuuri\u2019s space for the hundredth time, \u201cdo you want anymore sauce?\u201d\n\u201cAh, no,\u201d Yuuri replies, smiling as if he didn\u2019t notice that Viktor was basically falling into his lap. \u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Viktor beams gently at him, tossing an arm around his shoulders. \u201cSo? How is everything? I suppose we hardly see you outside of Ice Castle Hasetsu, so it\u2019s very nice to be able to get to know Yuuri\u2019s friends better outside of the work environment!\u201d\nYuuko is so transfixed by the arm around Yuuri\u2019s shoulders that she almost forgets to answer his question. \u201cOh, well, we\u2019re fine! We just had a wonderful date night, as you know, and I wanted to thank you for letting our girls stay over! I hope they didn\u2019t bother you\u2026 too much\u2026\u201d The picture pops up in her mind, and Yuuko blushes lightly. \n\u201cThat is, we were going to take you out to dinner as thanks, but we were really craving Yuuri\u2019s mom\u2019s food,\u201d Nishigori says, picking up the thread of the conversation. \u201cBut next time, for sure.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds fun,\u201d Yuuri says sincerely, smiling at them both. \u201cBut it really was no problem. I know my parents enjoyed having them around too.\u201d\nYuuko smiles even as her eyes stay glued to Viktor because\u2014really. How was Yuuri not noticing Viktor\u2019s blatant staring? All the words coming out of the Russian man\u2019s mouth all might as well have been directed at Yuuri, with how little he\u2019d been turning to face their guests.\nAnd yet, Yuuko didn\u2019t feel slighted. In fact, it almost felt as if she was the one intruding, and she had to fight against the urge to bashfully cover her face with her hands.\nYuuri\u2019s mother bustles in at that point, much to Yuuko\u2019s relief, and all eyes swing around to take in her cheerful smile. \u201cHow is everything? I\u2019m so sorry we weren\u2019t able to join you for dinner, but I\u2019m sure Vicchan and Yuuri are being gracious hosts! Ah, Vicchan, do you want another pork cutlet bowl?\u201d\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Viktor cheers. \u201cThank you! Mama Katsuki is much too kind.\u201d\n\u201cOh, please,\u201d Yuuri\u2019s mother demurs, beaming delightedly. \u201cOh, Nishigori, what about you? You and Yuuko should have some more, don\u2019t hold back!\u201d\nYuuko smiles up at Yuuri\u2019s kindly mother even as Nishigori politely declines her offer, when something catches her attention out of the corner of her eye. It\u2019s the stillness\u2014her triplets have never been that still before, and they all stare across the table with stars in their eyes. Yuuko\u2019s eyes lift up just in time to catch the tail end of the chaste kiss Viktor presses against Yuuri\u2019s cheek, and the latter leans away from Viktor, blushing furiously. \nYuuko flinches when both their eyes begin to move away from each other, and she dutifully locks them back onto her blissfully unaware husband and Yuuri\u2019s mother, both still chatting aimlessly. \n\u201cCan we tempt you with dessert?\u201d Viktor asks after Yuuri\u2019s mother has ambled away. \u201cOr drinks? I have some imported stuff that I think you\u2019d definitely like!\u201d\nNishigori laughs good-naturedly. \u201cOh, man, I hardly think I\u2019d be able to handle some of that stuff!\u201d\n\u201cYou never know\u2014\u201c Viktor breaks off to look down at his hand under the table, then up at Yuuri, who looks more nervous than usual. \n\u201cYuuri?\u201d Yuuko says concernedly, over her earlier bout of shyness. \n\u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 something I wanted to tell you both,\u201d Yuuri says quietly, looking up at his friends with no little amount of bashfulness. \u201cIt might be a little surprising, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d Yuuko says, lighting up immediately. The table creaks a little as she and her daughters lean forward excitedly, pressing up against the low table in their eagerness. Viktor hides a grin behind his hand, glancing knowingly at Nishigori, who looks faintly embarrassed.\n\u201cWell, the thing is\u2026\u201d Yuuri hedges, finger coming up to scratch at his chin. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a secret or anything, but I was just trying to find the right time to tell you guys tonight. Viktor and I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cUh huh?\u201d prompts Axel, lifting her phone like a recorder.\n\u201cWe are\u2026 we\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHmmm?\u201d Lutz leans forward even more, until her tiny legs are almost lifted clear off the ground as she leans right across the table with big eyes.\n\u201cWe just found out, just yesterday really, but Viktor and I are\u2026 we are\u2026\u201d Yuuri covers his mouth with his hand, looking terribly embarrassed.\n\u201c\u2018We are pregnant\u2019?\u201d mutters Loop, looking ready to tackle Yuuri for a straight answer.\n\u201cWe\u2019re soulmates!\u201d Yuuri finally blurts out, and Yuuko and her girls bounce straight up into the air. \n\u201cYes!\u201d Yuuko shrieks, darting around the table to envelope both of them into a tight hug. Viktor looks absolutely delighted, even as Yuuri stutters, overwhelmed. \u201cCongratulations, you two!\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations!\u201d booms Nishigori, looking both happy and relieved that Yuuri had finally gotten the news out. \u201cThis is amazing!\u201d\nYuuri opens his mouth to say something else, only to startle when Yuuko begins to sniffle. \u201cA-are you crying?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Yuuko wails, feeling both overjoyed and ridiculously sentimental. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you!\u201d\nThe triplets have scrambled under the table to add themselves into the makeshift dog pile, and Viktor begins to laugh when one of them climbs up his back to wrap tiny arms around his neck like a monkey.\n\u201cWelcome to the family!\u201d \u201cWelcome! Welcome!\u201d \u201cCan I be the flower girl at your wedding?\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d Yuuko says over the subsequent protests of the other two girls, wiping at her eyes. \u201cHave you told your parents?\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Yuuri says, looking a little misty eyed himself. \u201cThey were happy. They didn\u2019t seem very surprised, though.\u201d He laughs a little wetly, and Viktor looks at him, starry-eyed. \nYuuko gives Yuuri another hug right before they leave, and leans back to look at Yuuri happily. \u201cI\u2019m glad that Viktor is your special someone. Don\u2019t forget that the rest of your support system is right here at anytime though, alright?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Yuuri replies, looking happier and more relaxed than Yuuko has seen him in a while. \u201cI\u2019ll be counting on you guys throughout the road to the Grand Prix.\u201d\nHe and Viktor wave the Nishigori family goodbye from the entrance, and Yuuko bashfully averts her eyes again the minute she sees Viktor\u2019s head ducking down to level with Yuuri\u2019s.\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy for them,\u201d she tells Nishigori as they make their way through the crisp night air, looping her arm through her husband\u2019s. He smiles down at her as he lifts her hand up to gently kiss the back of it.\n\u201cIt definitely is pretty amazing,\u201d Nishigori muses, watching his daughters dart around them eagerly as they compare photos. \u201cHey\u2014what are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cJust one second,\u201d Yuuko tells him, opening up a new text message. \nYurio! she types, I just wanted to let you know\u2026 but I just found out that Viktor and the Yuuri here are soulmates! Isn\u2019t that amazing?\nYuuko\u2019s just about to tuck her phone back into her jacket pocket when it vibrates almost immediately. Yurio\u2019s reply consists merely of several of the disgruntled looking cat emoji, with a I knew already tacked on right after them. Yuuko smiles again, though, when her phone buzzes half a second later with another notification.\n\nGood for them though.\n\nBuzz.\n\nbtw. Don\u2019t forget to tell the Japanese Yuuri he\u2019s going to lose. Bye.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nViktor leans forward, tapping a finger to his chin contemplatively. \u201cMakkachin, do you think Yuuri would like a single rose? Or a bouquet with a variety of flowers?\u201d\nMakkachin yawns at Viktor\u2019s feet before pausing to nose at something interesting on the ground.\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d Viktor continues, \u201ca single rose might be a little too cheesy\u2026 but would an entire bouquet be too flamboyant?\u201d\nHe leans back on his heels and crosses his arms, breaking out of his reverie to shoot a small smile at the stunned looking flower vendor. People around Viktor have already begun to stop and stare, too, and Viktor knows it isn\u2019t long before fan contemplations begin running wild on the internet. \nBut Viktor doesn\u2019t mind\u2014he doesn\u2019t have anything to hide. \nBeaming, Viktor leans down and picks up a bouquet he\u2019d been eyeing for a while now, digging into his pocket to pay. Several high school girls gasp in the background, camera shutters quickly going off in an effort to catch the perfect picture of Viktor suavely holding a bouquet of flowers. \n\u201cCome, Makkachin,\u201d Viktor calls cheerfully, relishing the sound of crinkling plastic as he gently gathers the flowers into his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time to meet with Yuuri!\u201d\nIt had taken a very surprisingly small amount of effort to convince Yuuri to go on a date with him on one of their rest days.\n\u201cSure,\u201d Yuuri had said shyly when Viktor broached the subject. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d\n\u201cOkay! Your rest day has been changed to tomorrow, so we\u2019re going on a date then!\u201d Viktor replied eagerly, quick to gather Yuuri into his arms. Yuuri had merely laughed, snuggling in close\u2026\nViktor presses a hand against his mouth to smother his smile at the memory. It wouldn\u2019t do for a fan to catch a picture of him so off guard, would it?\nViktor glances at his watch before tugging out a small pen from his pocket. Viktor quickly jots down I\u2019m on my way! on the back of his hand, making sure to end it with a perfectly drawn heart. Seconds later, his phone rings.\n\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor says immediately after he picks up, eyes softening. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just reply through writing?\u201d\n\u201cTexting is faster. Calling is fastest,\u201d Yuuri replies, sounding slightly amused. \u201cI just wanted to let you know that I\u2019m at the park already.\u201d\n\u201cYou know how much I love seeing your handwriting,\u201d Viktor whines halfheartedly. \n\u201cWell\u2026 I do too, like seeing your handwriting I mean,\u201d Yuuri amends. \u201cBut sometimes, I kind of just want to\u2026 hear your voice\u2026\u201d\nViktor has to pause mid step to gather himself, pressing a hand against his widening smile once more. \u201cYuuri! So sweet!\u201d\nYuuri sighs exasperatedly. \u201cViktor\u2026 I\u2019m already embarrassed enough as it is!\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be!\u201d Viktor replies, pressing the phone closer to his ear. \u201cIt makes me happy. I\u2019m almost to the park, should we stay on the phone together?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Yuuri says, voice suddenly sounding a little distant. Viktor frowns a little, wondering if the volume on his phone wasn\u2019t working. \u201cAh, I\u2019ll see you soon, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Viktor echoes, already feeling excited again. He tucks his phone in his pocket, beaming down at Makkachin. \u201cFirst date with the soulmate! You\u2019ll be our security for the day, won\u2019t you?\u201d\nMakkachin barks in response to the warmth in his owner\u2019s tone, bounding around Viktor\u2019s legs eagerly.\nViktor is mid laugh when black ink catches his eye, and he looks down eagerly, sure that Yuuri changed his mind about writing. It looked like a completed message, so Yuuri had probably been writing while they\u2019d still been on the phone. Was there something else he needed to tell Viktor?\nViktor freezes mid-step again at the sight of an unfamiliar phone number scrawled onto the back of his hand, and he has to remind himself not to squeeze the flowers too hard lest they break.\nHe stares down at it for one, two seconds, before Viktor suddenly darts forward, plastic rustling loudly in his wake. Makkachin barks, before excitedly taking off behind him, happy for the exercise. \nViktor wheels around another corner, almost skidding, when he spots Yuuri standing by the park billboard, very much alone. Still, he doesn\u2019t stop running, and Yuuri turns in alarm at the sound of thundering footsteps. \n\u201cViktor!\u201d Yuuri yelps, and a second later Viktor has him in his arms, mindless of the flowers in his hands. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201c\n\u201cWhose number is that?\u201d Viktor asks lowly, turning his head to allow his lips to brush against the shell of Yuuri\u2019s ear. Judging from the sudden warmth, Yuuri is blushing, and Viktor carefully moves to press a long kiss to Yuuri\u2019s cheek. \u201cAlso, hello.\u201d\n\u201cH-hello,\u201d Yuuri squeaks. \u201cIt\u2019s a number for a dog breeder. Posted on the board here? We were on the phone so I couldn\u2019t take a picture of it, so I thought I\u2019d write it down instead\u2026 Viktor? Can you let me go now?\u201d\nViktor buries his suddenly red face in the crook of Yuuri\u2019s shoulder, suddenly adamant that Yuuri not see the embarrassed blush that had overtaken him. Honestly\u2026\n\u201cDid you think it was someone else\u2019s number?\u201d Yuuri asks, sounding suddenly amused, and Viktor squeezes him tighter. \u201cHey. That\u2019s insulting.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d mutters Viktor, moving again to press another kiss to Yuuri\u2019s cheek. It moves upwards in a smile, one that Viktor finds is mirrored on his own face. \u201cI guess I jumped to conclusions.\u201d\nYuuri sighs. When Viktor leans back to look at his face, the younger man looks away. \u201cI would never take someone\u2019s number while we\u2019re together!\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Viktor repeats sheepishly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that this is all so new, so I\u2019m a little\u2026 I just want to keep you close, is all.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I can understand that,\u201d Yuuri concedes, wrapping his own arms around Viktor\u2019s torso. \u201cI mean, I feel the same way\u2026\u201d\nViktor blushes, eyes moving adoringly over Yuuri\u2019s face. \u201cOh! I got you flowers!\u201d \nThankfully, they weren\u2019t as crumpled as Viktor had feared, and Yuuri beams in delight. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get you anything! Will you let me pay for the lunch?\u201d\n\u201cWe can split on that, if you don\u2019t want me paying,\u201d Viktor says, pressing a chaste kiss to Yuuri\u2019s lips. \u201cYou can treat me to dessert if you want, but you don\u2019t have to. The flowers are no problem\u2014I wanted to get them for you. But next time, I\u2019m buying the meal for us both.\u201d\n\u201cMm. You can try,\u201d Yuuri shoots back shyly, blushing profusely at the grin Viktor gives him. \nViktor hums contemplatively, admiring the way Yuuri\u2019s cheeks tint pink. \u201cYou know, maybe we should just have an at-home date? Privacy? Hey, what do you think\u2026?\u201d Viktor is dying to cover Yuuri in kisses, but he\u2019s already counted three or four people skirting around the edges of his peripherals, phones out. \nBesides, the look on Yuuri\u2019s face is enough to shake him out of his reverie, and Viktor leans back worriedly. \u201cYuuri?\u201d\nThe frozen look on Yuuri\u2019s face melts off, replaced with his usual flustered smile. \u201cAh\u2014but, well, I was looking forward to our date,\u201d Yuuri says. He glances downward shyly before stepping to Viktor\u2019s left side and linking their arms together. Just like that, Viktor is on Cloud 9, and he eagerly tugs Yuuri closer. \n\u201cThat makes me happy too!\u201d Viktor says easily, and Yuuri blinks up at him.\n\u201cLean down please,\u201d Yuuri requests, and Viktor tilts his head before doing so. \nYuuri\u2019s fingers are soft against Viktor\u2019s face as the younger man leans up the rest of the way to initiate a kiss. Viktor\u2019s eyes fall shut almost against his will, and he sighs against Yuuri\u2019s lips. \nThere\u2019s the sound of a camera shutter, and Yuuri breaks away in alarm (much to the dismay of a now-disgruntled Viktor) to stare surprisedly at a group of teenage girls. They squeak in alarm before darting away, their voices raising to chastise the one person who hadn\u2019t had the sense to put their phone on vibrate.\n\u201cWhy do people keep forgetting to silence their phones for a secret picture?\u201d Viktor muses, feeling an odd bout of deja vu. Yuuri groans and pinches his nose.\n\u201cAt least they didn\u2019t leave the flash on. I think. Viktor, you know these pictures are going to be all over the internet starting now, right?\u201d Yuuri looks worried, and Viktor smoothes a thumb on the furrow of his soulmate\u2019s brow. \n\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Viktor says gently. \u201cBut does it bother you?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026 actually, it doesn\u2019t really bother me,\u201d Yuuri admits. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, but at least now people will definitely know that you\u2019re mine.\u201d\nViktor laughs in delight. \u201cNow, a walk on the beach? Then lunch? Then dessert and coffee, yes?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Yuuri replies, and his arm slides away from Viktor\u2019s in order to reach down and link their hands instead. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d \nViktor is so, so in love.\n\u201cAnyway\u2026\u201d Viktor begins coyly as they walk in step, Makkachin trailing close beside them. \u201cYou want a puppy? You\u2019ll make Makkachin jealous, you know. He really likes you. But if that\u2019s what you want, I\u2019m more than happy to get you a puppy. Two puppies? Five? Ten?\u201d\nYuuri laughs. \u201cIt was only a thought! I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready yet for another dog. I love Makkachin a lot, though\u2026 I had one almost exactly like him, only Vi\u2014my poodle was a little smaller.\u201d Yuuri\u2019s blushing for some reason, and Viktor tilts his head to the side curiously. Vi\u2026?\n\u201cOh? I see\u2026 could you tell me about him?\u201d\nYuuri perks up immediately, and the smile that Viktor adores is back in place.\n\u201cOkay, yeah! Well, V\u2014I mean, my poodle was an absolute sweetheart. You and Makkachin would have loved him. There was this one time\u2026\u201d\nViktor listens closely as they walk slowly together, relishing in the sound of Yuuri\u2019s voice, punctuated by the waves of the ocean in the nearing distance. \n(Later, Viktor laughs when Yuuri receives a call from an irate sounding Minako, yelling about how she had to find out about their connection through the media of all things. Viktor secretly looks up the articles and saves each and every photo of him and Yuuri that he sees.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe past few days have only been the beginning of the honeymoon stage of their relationship, and Yuuri was over the moon with happiness.\nYears ago, a teenage Yuuri would have died just to get the chance to be in the same vicinity as Viktor. Heck, the Yuuri of the previous Grand Prix had been floored just by being addressed by Viktor for less than a minute. The thought of the encounter still sends Yuuri into a small bout of embarrassment, thinking about how he\u2019d walked away in shame after Viktor had asked him if he\u2019d wanted a photo. \nAnd now that Viktor had situated himself as a constant in Yuuri\u2019s life, Yuuri could barely remember the days prior to having Viktor as a coach, then a lover. \n\u2019Lover\u2026\u2019 Yuuri feels his ears burn red, and he glances up at Viktor from where he\u2019s laid out on the floor. He\u2019d been cuddling on the floor with Makkachin and browsing through Instagram, when Yuuri had stumbled on a photo of Viktor in the search page. It had caught his eye mainly because it was Viktor, and a throwback photo, too. Yuuri delightedly takes in the sight of a younger Viktor waving to a crowd, dressed in the exact outfit Yuuri had chosen from Viktor\u2019s arsenal of clothing to wear for Eros. \nWow\u2026 this brings back memories of when I first saw him perform this program, Yuuri thinks dazedly, absentmindedly rubbing his face against Makkachin\u2019s soft fur. Viktor looked so beautiful here, too\u2026 I wonder if I\u2019m carrying off the outfit just as well as he is.\n\u201cYuuri?\u201d\nYuuri tears his eyes away from his phone to look up at Viktor again. Yuuri\u2019s soulmate lounges on his ridiculously expensive sofa, an opened magazine resting against his leg. It seems largely ignored, too\u2014Viktor looks as if he\u2019d been staring at Yuuri for a while now. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to come up here?\u201d\nYuuri\u2019s face burns even as he locks his phone\u2014after making sure to quickly screenshot the photo, of course. Yuuri is extra careful when he moves to step over Makkachin (the dog had looked so betrayed that one time Yuuri had accidentally stepped on his tail), and quickly settles himself down in place right next to Viktor. \n\u201cI meant here,\u201d Viktor says, pouting as he pats his lap. The magazine quickly sails from Viktor\u2019s hand to fall ungracefully to the floor, and Yuuri follows its path almost apprehensively. \nTo say that Yuuri was still shy around Viktor was an understatement. Sure, all the time spent with Viktor during and training and free time had helped ease his feelings of idolization. But it seemed like finding out that his soulmate was indeed Viktor Nikiforov was enough to send Yuuri\u2019s heart back into overdrive, especially when they were alone. \nViktor was Yuuri\u2019s first serious\u2026 anything. Yuuri had known of Viktor\u2019s existence since he was young. Those kisses at the reveal had been Yuuri\u2019s first. \nWas it the same for Viktor?\nYuuri eyes Viktor\u2019s outstretched arms for half a second before he scrambles in, carefully situating himself on Viktor\u2019s lap. It still feels embarrassing, but Yuuri adores being in Viktor\u2019s arms, and Viktor always seems so happy whenever Yuuri was affectionate right back\u2026\nOne example being that exact moment. Yuuri can\u2019t help but laugh when Viktor sighs contentedly as he wraps one arm around Yuuri, the other coming up to gently run through Yuuri\u2019s hair. In turn, Yuuri relaxes fully against Viktor, turning to rest his cheek against Viktor\u2019s shoulder, nose brushing the side of his neck. \nYuuri liked Viktor. A lot. Probably even love, as early as it might have been to say\u2026 but still.\nBut that didn\u2019t mean he still didn\u2019t have a few of his worries leftover. For one thing, Yuuri was most definitely inexperienced in the more intimate aspects of a relationship, and just the thought of it left him wracked with nerves.\nNot to mention the fact that it pulled up a plethora of questions concerning his soulmate. Viktor was twenty-seven. If he was counting right, Yuuri hadn\u2019t made contact until Viktor was around the age of\u2026 seventeen? Yuuri tenses a little, and Viktor murmurs a tiny questioning sound as he moves to nuzzle at Yuuri. \nRather than answer, Yuuri tilts his head to brush his lips against Viktor\u2019s jawline and feels his soulmate\u2019s hand tighten against his side. \n\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor murmurs, and his low voice sends chills up Yuuri\u2019s spine. Or\u2014oh. It was Viktor\u2019s other hand, having detangled from Yuuri\u2019s hair to trail slowly up and down his back, catching along the thin fabric of Yuuri\u2019s shirt. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Do you want a kiss?\u201d \n\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d Yuuri lies, turning his eyes away. \u201cBut, well\u2026 I guess I wouldn\u2019t mind a kiss.\u201d \nViktor eagerly nips at Yuuri\u2019s ear once, eliciting a surprised shudder from the younger man, before moving to trail kisses from the corner of Yuuri\u2019s eye. He tilts Yuuri\u2019s head upward, pressing his lips against Yuuri\u2019s skin until he finally brushes against Yuuri\u2019s mouth. It\u2019s soft at first, hardly even a kiss.\nRather than wait, Yuuri\u2019s hand snakes up to lightly press against the back of Viktor\u2019s head, and the latter chuckles even as he allows Yuuri to press them closer together. \nViktor was so good at this kind of thing, and Yuuri feels another twinge of worry even as his lips move against Viktor\u2019s. Had his soulmate had any partners before Yuuri? Not that Yuuri would ever love Viktor less if he had\u2014Yuuri lets his lips part, almost desperately tilting his head to deepen the kiss. He would never even consider thinking less of Viktor if that was the case. But Yuuri was only human\u2026 of course he\u2019d be jealous. But still, he wanted to know\u2026 but should he?\nViktor leans back suddenly, and their lips part with a wet pop. Yuuri lets out a small sound of confusion, and Viktor smiles as he thumbs at Yuuri\u2019s lips. \n\u201cYou seem a little distracted. Or\u2026 are you just tired from today\u2019s training?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m just tired,\u201d Yuuri says quickly, grateful for the excuse. \n\u201cThen shall we sleep?\u201d Viktor asks, already moving to lift Yuuri up. Yuuri laughs, squirming out of Viktor\u2019s hold to stand and grasp at his soulmate\u2019s hand instead. \n\u201cYou\u2019re not princess-carrying me to bed! That\u2019s just embarrassing!\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s only us! And Makkachin!\u201d Viktor whines, even as he allows Yuuri to tug him towards the bed. \u201cAnd Makkachin wouldn\u2019t tell anyone, I promise.\u201d\nYuuri snorts as he flops down into Viktor\u2019s bed, burying his face in the pillow to hide his oncoming blush. Ever since that first reveal, Yuuri had finally agreed to sleep with his soulmate (in the same bed as Viktor, that was all!), which had overjoyed Viktor immensely. \nAnd Yuuri had almost expected something more to happen, especially in the following few nights after that. But other than a few sleepy kisses, Viktor had been more than content to curl up around Yuuri, sandwiching Yuuri between himself and a very warm and fluffy Makkachin. \nThe click of the lamp resounds in the room at the same time the sound of cloth hitting the floor meets Yuuri\u2019s ears, and Yuuri squeezes his eyes shut. This part was always when it was hardest for Yuuri to stay calm because\u2014\nThere\u2019s a rustle of sheets as Viktor slides into bed next to him, and then Yuuri\u2019s being turned and pressed into a soft expanse of warm skin. \u201cGood night, Yuuri,\u201d Viktor murmurs, snaking his hands up Yuuri\u2019s shirt to press against his back, and Yuuri all but melts into Viktor, face burning. \n\u201cG-good night,\u201d Yuuri replies softly, lips brushing Viktor\u2019s bare chest. Viktor tilts his face up again for one last kiss before going quiet, his soft breathing making Yuuri\u2019s bangs flutter lightly. \nYuuri sighs. Viktor was so natural at this. The ease with which he moved into intimacy with Yuuri was startling, but then again, Viktor was just a naturally touchy feely person. But still, did it mean he\u2019d had at least some experience with partners when he was younger?\nAnd if he did, why didn\u2019t he at least attempt to go any further with Yuuri? Was Yuuri even ready to do anything like that with Viktor? \n\nDid he have previous partners? Was he seriously, really happy when he found out I was his soulmate? If he was, then why did he wait so long to tell me? Because I seem so inexperienced?\n\nYuuri grumbles frustratedly, turning anxiously against Viktor\u2019s side, furiously cursing his brain. It was just \u2018that time of the night\u2019 where all his worries came rushing at him from all sides. Sleeping next to Viktor had kept them at bay though. Viktor absently moves to rub at Yuuri\u2019s shoulder as he murmurs unintelligible words of comfort before drifting back to sleep.\nThis is ridiculous. I\u2019ll just ask him about it tomorrow. We\u2019ll talk about every single little thing I\u2019m worried about, and it will be fine, Yuuri decides resolutely as he wraps an arm around Viktor\u2019s torso. It will be fine. \n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\nIt was not fine.\nYuuri stumbles a landing, nearly twisting his ankle in the process. Luckily, he saves himself by slapping a hand down on the rink barrier next to him, thoroughly bruising the palm of his hand but saving himself a hard landing on the ice. \nViktor tuts from across the rink, gently tapping his skate against the ice. \u201cYou need to be more careful, or you\u2019ll really hurt yourself, Yuuri! You need to commit to the jump, because if you waver mid-air, you\u2019re only going to botch the landing. Mentally focus!\u201d\nYuuri groans, irritably wiping away at the sweat that had gathered at his brow. Grand Prix, Grand Prix, Grand Prix, Yuuri thinks almost viciously, straightening his back. Grand Prix, Viktor\u2019s past, Grand Prix\u2014wait. Yuuri slumps against the barrier as he rubs against his temple. Focus, Yuuri!\n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Viktor\u2019s voice sounds closer now, and Yuuri looks up into concerned eyes. \u201cDid you hit your head on the barrier?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Yuuri says, feeling slightly embarrassed. \u201cSorry\u2014I\u2019ll focus.\u201d\nViktor hums contemplatively, looking over Yuuri with a critical eye as if affirming for himself that his soulmate really wasn\u2019t injured. \u201cAlright\u2026 Let\u2019s try one more time, and with music again. Remember, you\u2019re a seductive pork cutlet bowl who wants me to eat you, right?\u201d Viktor leers jokingly, leaning forward and wiggling his eyebrows suggestively. Yuuri laughs and tugs at Viktor\u2019s hand as he skates by to get back into position. \n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Yuuri replies, inhaling deeply in an attempt to center himself. A quick glance at Viktor is all he allows himself before Yuuri kicks off, moving into the start of the program.\nEverything goes well in the first half, but the the minute the second half begins, Yuuri realizes he just doesn\u2019t have it in him to complete a jump. \nThe vibrant music continues on as Yuuri slows to a stop, and he raises his hand without looking at Viktor for fear of seeing disappointment in his coach\u2019s face. \u201cSorry, I\u2026 can we stop? I can\u2019t concentrate.\u201d \nThe music clicks off almost immediately, and Viktor\u2019s skates hiss against the ice as he makes his way over to Yuuri. \n\u201cI knew there was something wrong,\u201d Viktor says, sounding lightly disapproving. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? We need to work through each and every problem. Is it the program itself? Because I know you can do it\u2014you\u2019ve almost gotten it down perfectly. Are you stressed about finding the music for your free program?\u201d\n\u201cThat too, yes,\u201d Yuuri admits, wincing a little at the reminder of yet another worry. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just that\u2026\u201d\nViktor pauses, waiting, and sighs when Yuuri doesn\u2019t continue. Viktor ducks down worriedly in an attempt to look at Yuuri\u2019s downcast face. Out of the corner of his eye, Yuuri sees Viktor frown when he refuses to look up. \n\u201cLet\u2019s head home, then,\u201d Viktor says decisively, holding up a quelling hand when Yuuri looks up at him in alarm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know you\u2019re taking your training seriously. But even figure skating can be dangerous if you aren\u2019t all here mentally.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Yuuri replies, skating behind Viktor to the rink\u2019s entrance with a low flush on his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to delay training\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor murmurs soothingly, smoothly dropping his coach persona in favor of cupping Yuuri\u2019s chin softly with his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t you know? I\u2019m here for you in support as your soulmate, and in guidance as your coach. If it helps, we could talk about it on our way home?\u201d\nYuuri nods silently as his hand comes up to loosely grasp at Viktor\u2019s wrist, gently trailing his fingers against the back of Viktor\u2019s hand. Viktor\u2019s eyes soften, and he leans down to press a gentle kiss to Yuuri\u2019s forehead.\nViktor stays close to Yuuri\u2019s side as they make their way back to Yu-topia, choosing to walk his bike to the side rather than ride ahead. Makkachin, as if sensing how subdued Yuuri is, bumps against Yuuri\u2019s legs every now and then, pressing his flank against Yuuri\u2019s shin as if in an attempt to comfort. \n\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d Yuuri says suddenly, squeezing the straps of his backpack. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not even worth worrying about.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Viktor says contemplatively, rubbing at his chin. \u201cEspecially not if it bothers you that much.\u201d\n\u201cIt might bother you,\u201d Yuuri admits, and Viktor\u2019s eyebrows shoot up to his hairline.\n\u201cWell? How would I know if that\u2019s true if you don\u2019t tell me?\u201d Viktor says gently. Yuuri turns to look up at him. Viktor\u2019s bangs hide one of his bright eyes, and Yuuri reaches up to push it away without thinking, relishing in the sight of both of Viktor\u2019s eyes sparkling in the low light of the fading sun. They both pause mid-step (part of Yuuri gives thanks that the road is pretty much deserted), and Viktor\u2019s hand catches Yuuri's before it can fall away, keeping it pressed to his cheek. \n\u201cWould it be easier for you to write it?\u201d Viktor says softly, and Yuuri ducks his head in a shaky nod, his free hand already moving to reach into his pocket for the small pen he always keeps there. \nViktor kicks out the bike stand and moves to lounge against the small stone wall that lines the sidewalk, eyes gentle as Yuuri moves to follow him. He reaches out to tug Yuuri close until the younger man\u2019s back is pressed to his front. \u201cI\u2019m not looking,\u201d Viktor says softly, burying his face into Yuuri\u2019s hair. \u201cGo ahead and write.\u201d\nYuuri\u2019s eyes close for a tiny heartbeat, enjoying the feel of Viktor\u2019s warmth around him, before he uncaps his pen and tugs a glove off with his teeth. He writes, and feels as if his heart is thundering in his ears when he finally moves to re-cover the pen, jostling Viktor\u2019s arms slightly as he slides it back into his pocket. \u201cOkay\u2026 I\u2019m done.\u201d\nViktor\u2019s hand lifts from Yuuri\u2019s waist to bring his hand closer to his eyes, and Yuuri clenches his hands around Viktor\u2019s other arm, leaning his head back against Viktor\u2019s shoulder. He bites his lip when Viktor tenses suddenly, and Yuuri feels hyperaware of Viktor\u2019s arms around him, the cold bite of the slowly chilling air, and the feel of his glasses sliding down his nose as he tucks his chin to his chest. \n\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor breathes, sounding agonized, and Yuuri squeezes his eyes shut. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026 I didn\u2019t know that this was bothering you. I keep causing you pain, don\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Yuuri tugs himself free of Viktor\u2019s hold to wheel around and regard his soulmate in shock. \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014that\u2019s not what I was going for! And besides, didn\u2019t I cause you pain? You waited for so long, and it would only be natural to seek love if you didn\u2019t think you had a soulmate! It\u2019s me who\u2019s being childish for letting something like this bother me!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Viktor says sharply. \u201cIt would drive me crazy too, not knowing. And it does\u2014but I\u2019d only assumed that you\u2019ve never\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI was waiting for you,\u201d Yuuri admits softly. \u201cAnd even now, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for anything too intense. Like, physically, I mean.\u201d Yuuri blushes profusely. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d ever\u2026 I would never be mad at you, if you\u2019ve been with other people. I just want to know.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Viktor replies, reaching out for Yuuri. He\u2019s quick to step back into Viktor\u2019s arms, relief from already having admitted his worries reducing his limbs to jelly.\n\u201cThere was a girl,\u201d Viktor continues, voice low against Yuuri\u2019s ear, \u201cwho didn\u2019t believe in soulmates. She believed that we have the freedom of choice, and wanted me to choose her. I don\u2019t think she had a soulmate at all.\u201d\nYuuri tightens his hands in Viktor\u2019s jacket, a twinge of jealousy making his stomach twist despite himself. \u201cWhat\u2026 what happened to her?\u201d\n\u201cWell, not having a soulmate isn\u2019t completely uncommon, but I\u2019m sure she was still lonely nevertheless,\u201d Viktor replies, tilting his head back to regard the darkening sky. \u201cI hate to say it, but I don\u2019t know what happened to her. But this was when I was still pretty young, I believe, so her words stuck with me all throughout my teenage years.\u201d\nViktor\u2019s hand begins to play with the strands at the nape of Yuuri\u2019s neck almost absently. \u201cI\u2026 did have some partners. So I\u2019m not completely inexperienced, Yuuri.\u201d\nYuuri nods resolutely against the fabric of Viktor\u2019s jacket. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. I think you were right for doing so. It must have been lonely\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know you were scared. I was too, even if I didn\u2019t fully realize it. It\u2019s a life changing thing, and she was right\u2014what about the freedom of choice?\u201d Viktor murmurs.\n\u201cWere you upset that your chance at choosing love had gone when you found out that your soulmate was me?\u201d Yuuri asks sincerely, looking up to regard Viktor with clear eyes. \u201cIs that why you waited? I don\u2019t mean it in a bad way, I just\u2026 I\u2019m just trying to understand.\u201d\n\u201dYuuri.\u201d Viktor rubs his nose against Yuuri\u2019s, looking almost agonized. \u201cIt was the best thing that had ever happened to me! The more time I spent with you, the more I realized that even if I did have a soulmate, I would still choose pork cutlet bowls over them anytime.\u201d\nThey both laugh softly, and Yuuri noses back gratefully. \n\u201cI waited because I wanted you to feel the same way before you found out that your soulmate was me,\u201d Viktor continues sheepishly. \u201cI wanted you to think only of me, and not of some random idealized version of someone you hadn\u2019t even met.\u201d\n\u201cThat \u2018ideal\u2019 version was already you,\u201d Yuuri says somewhat exasperatedly. \u201cI know I made you wait, but you were basically tormenting me! It was unfair!\u201d His frown twitches into a half smile at the ashamed look Viktor gives him. \n\u201cSorry,\u201d Viktor sighs, \u201cseeing your flustered face was also just too\u2014ah, sorry,\u201d Viktor breaks off at Yuuri\u2019s admonishing look, smiling sheepishly again.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Yuuri says instead, \u201cfor telling me all of this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, thank you,\u201d Viktor replies, doing his best to match Yuuri\u2019s serious tone, \u201cfor listening.\u201d\nYuuri smiles, already noticing the return of Viktor\u2019s usual lightheartedness. \n\u201cI\u2019m just glad we were able to clear it up,\u201d Viktor says in response to Yuuri\u2019s unasked question. \u201cI\u2019m happy that you aren\u2019t worried anymore.\u201d\n\u201cI do feel a lot better,\u201d Yuuri murmurs, holding out a hand for Viktor\u2019s. His soulmate smiles back, one hand grasping for Yuuri\u2019s as the other reaches for his bike. Makkachin perks up from where he\u2019d been napping, all too happy to follow his owners as they begin the walk back to the hot springs again. \nOnly now, Yuuri still doesn\u2019t seem to be able to meet Viktor\u2019s eyes\u2014for a totally different reason. Every time Yuuri glances up to look at Viktor\u2019s profile, he\u2019s met with bright eyes staring right back, and Yuuri twists his head away, every single time. \nHis usual Viktor-induced blush seems plenty stronger than usual, and again, Yuuri is all too aware of his hand in Viktor\u2019s as they make their way back home. \nEven when they reach the entrance, they hardly say a word, and Viktor only moves to press a kiss to Yuuri\u2019s cheek before leading Yuuri to dinner. The hot springs follows soon after, and the springs itself is deserted save for Viktor and Yuuri. Yet Viktor only sinks into the water an arms length away from Yuuri, finally speaking to start a lighthearted conversation that Yuuri is all too happy to reciprocate. \nStill, the air around them feels more quieted somehow, and it lulls Yuuri into an almost a sluggish sense of comfort. It\u2019s in the gentle look that Viktor keeps giving Yuuri, and in every time they brush against each other as they move to dress after their bath. Viktor is all softness, brushing back Yuuri\u2019s damp hair even as he chats to Yuuri about a past skating experience, and Yuuri notes that his constant blush is mirrored on his soulmate\u2019s high cheekbones. \nViktor is still chatting about something\u2014about how Makkachin had helped to calm him down before a competition\u2014even as he bundles Yuuri towards the bed, walking him backwards until Yuuri\u2019s knees hit the mattress and he falls back into soft cushions. \nViktor stops talking then, and gently moves to lay beside Yuuri, stretching out next to him. Yuuri stretches out to grab Viktor\u2019s hand, and brings it to his lips to kiss almost shyly. Viktor smiles, pleased, quick to mirror the motion. \n\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor murmurs, and the bedsheets rustle as Viktor repositions them both so that his back is to the headboard, Yuuri\u2019s front pressing against his. Yuuri still feels terribly bashful, no matter how many times Viktor has brought him close, but leans in almost unconsciously to press his forehead to Viktor\u2019s. Viktor looks almost dazed as Yuuri presses gentle kisses against Viktor\u2019s face, moving from forehead, to nose, to cheek, until Yuuri\u2019s lips are brushing against Viktor\u2019s in a whisper of a kiss. \nFor a second, Yuuri is content to merely hover there, smiling at the impatiently furrowed brow Viktor gets when he realizes Yuuri isn\u2019t going to move. Rather than wait any longer, Viktor meets him the rest of the way, lips already parted. Yuuri lets out a whimper at the contact, moving to straddle Viktor even more closely in a mirror image of their first few kisses. \nThe bed is soft against Yuuri\u2019s knees, and he leans most of his weight there as he pushes further into Viktor\u2019s embrace, shivering when Viktor\u2019s hands find their way up the back of his shirt. \n\u201cI never went any further even after that first time we both knew we were soulmates,\u201d Viktor murmurs into Yuuri\u2019s ear before breaking off for another kiss, and the lowness of his voice has Yuuri attempting to duck away. Viktor holds him in place with a hand against the side of his head, mouthing at Yuuri\u2019s ear in between every word. \u201cI never went any further because I was waiting for you to make the first move, when you were ready.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Yuuri says, dumbstruck, still straining despite himself to put at least some distance between his ear and Viktor\u2019s mouth. Yuuri was going to combust.\nViktor is relentless though, and moves away from Yuuri\u2019s ear to claim his lips again, hands moving gently at the soft skin of Yuuri\u2019s back.\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready, though\u2014\u201c Yuuri says hastily, face pinking from something other than arousal, and Viktor pauses.\n\u201cI know, we\u2019ll go slow,\u201d Viktor replies, kissing along Yuuri\u2019s jaw. \u201cAt your pace.\u201d Viktor sits back a little to regard Yuuri with hooded eyes, arms spread open in invitation, and Yuuri can only sit and take him in for a moment. \n\u201cI\u2026 okay,\u201d Yuuri whispers, and it takes all of his courage to press the edges of Viktor\u2019s robe down until they pool at his wrists, baring a wide expanse of skin. Yuuri has seen his soulmate naked, many times before, but it was\u2014it seemed like it was never something that Yuuri would ever grow to get used to. \n\u201cYou can touch,\u201d Viktor says almost coyly, looking up at Yuuri amusedly when the younger man presses his hands against his face. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to hold you back. I\u2019m yours, after all.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Yuuri says, resolutely taking his hands away from his face. Again, Viktor is blushing too, and it makes Yuuri feel a hundred times better. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d\n\u201cMhm.\u201d Viktor closes his eyes when Yuuri presses his hands against Viktor\u2019s skin, shyly moving to trail his fingers lightly over Viktor\u2019s front. Both their breaths catch when Yuuri leans forward to press a kiss to Viktor\u2019s collarbone. \nAll at once though, Yuuri leans back to cover his face with his hands again. \u201cWait, wait\u2014pause!\u201d he says almost hysterically, now moving to wave his hands in front of them both. \u201cI need a break!\u201d\n\u201cWell, I hope you\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d Viktor interjects, sounding far too gleeful. \u201cWhat progress!\u201d\nYuuri makes a high pitched sound of distress, and Viktor laughs. \n\u201cYuuri, stop,\u201d his soulmate says softly, all seriousness once again. \u201cAt your pace, like I said. I\u2019m just happy to have you with me at all.\u201d\nYuuri sighs, slumping against Viktor\u2019s chest and tangling both their hands together.\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re so famous that I seriously thought I was dreaming when you appeared in my family\u2019s hot springs.\u201d Yuuri tilts his head to nuzzle into the crook of Viktor\u2019s neck, and his soulmate sighs happily. \u201cBut when you said you were going to coach me, I would have done anything, paid anything, to get you to stay.\u201d\n\u201cMy, your dedication is so admirable,\u201d Viktor replies, looking highly amused. \u201cWell, since you admitted that to me, I can freely admit that I first thought you were the most adorable thing I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d He coos at Yuuri\u2019s resulting blush, smiling when Yuuri looks away. Viktor pauses for a moment to reach under the pillows next to him to extract a pen they\u2019d left there\u2014there were pens everywhere around them now, in their pockets, in their bags, even scattered around each of their rooms. Yuuri takes it from him to shyly draw doodles on his own arm, glancing away from Viktor\u2019s warm gaze.\n\u201cHey, speaking of the coaching fee\u2026\u201d Yuuri pauses, glancing up absently to watch the ink spread slowly across Viktor\u2019s arm, trailing down to his wrist. Viktor tilts his head questioningly, even as his eyes lazily follow the path of the ink on his skin.\n\u201cMm?\u201d\n\u201cHow much is it going to be? I don\u2019t want to cheat you out of an income just because\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, Yuuri, you really think I\u2019m going to charge my soulmate the price of a coaching fee?\u201d Viktor laughs, carding his hands through Yuuri\u2019s hair before sliding them to rest against the nape of Yuuri\u2019s neck. \u201cYou\u2019re so silly!\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Yuuri replies, burying his face in the crook of Viktor\u2019s neck again. \u201cI-I see, thank you\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI mean, not full price at least! Soulmates get a special discount of ten percent. By the way, interest has been building up ever since day one, so I hope you\u2019ve got a sizable fund to back you up!\u201d\nYuuri\u2019s head flies back up, barely avoiding clipping Viktor on the chin, and his face is white from shock. \u201cH-how much is it? If you\u2019re willing, I-I could pay in segments, but I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201c\nViktor laughs delightedly and bundles Yuuri close to his chest again, peppering his face with kisses. \u201cYuuri, Yuuri! I was kidding!\u201d\nYuuri blushes violently and attempts to squirm away, smacking Viktor on his chest. \u201cYou\u2014you did it again! At this rate, I\u2019m going to end up not trusting anything you say\u2014\u201c\nViktor silences him with a kiss, pressing both hands against Yuuri\u2019s face in an attempt to get him to pucker up. Yuuri resists for a grand total of one second, and applauds his own tenacity for another, before allowing himself to melt forward, wrapping his arms around Viktor\u2019s neck. \n\u201cMm,\u201d Viktor murmurs when he finally pulls away to admire his handiwork. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t get enough of your face whenever I do that!\u201d At Yuuri\u2019s scowl, Viktor flushes, a guilty smile on his face. \u201cAh\u2026 sorry. I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d Viktor buries his nose in Yuuri\u2019s hair, nuzzling enthusiastically. \n\u201cAt least, not too much,\u201d Yuuri thinks he hears being mumbled into his hair, and he squirms roughly in in faux anger, even as he allows Viktor to keep his arms tight around his shoulders. \n\u201cI think I could take payment in segments though,\u201d Viktor says once he finally gets Yuuri to settle down with gentle kisses in lieu of another apology. \u201cThe only way it would possibly cost you would be in terms of hours of sleep, but we can work that in with your training schedule.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d Yuuri stares blankly at Viktor, until it finally clicks in his mind, and Viktor laughs in delight again when Yuuri\u2019s face turns bright red again.\n\u201cJust kidding. Like I said, whenever you\u2019re ready. It\u2019s your call,\u201d Viktor says, gently bumping his forehead to Yuuri\u2019s. \n\u201cHonestly!\u201d Yuuri groans exasperatedly, flopping down and pressing a cheek against his soulmate\u2019s skin. \u201cI\u2019m never going to get used to you.\u201d\n\u201cI should hope not,\u201d Viktor says, affronted. \u201cI intend to keep this relationship as interesting as possible forever and ever.\u201d Viktor goes quiet again, and Yuuri peeks up at him curiously. This time, the blush on Yuuri\u2019s face is mirrored on Viktor\u2019s, and Yuuri allows his soulmate to cradle his face in his hands. Viktor smoothes his thumbs on Yuuri\u2019s cheeks and leans in to press a gentle kiss onto Yuuri\u2019s nose. \n\u201cI really am sorry,\u201d his coach begins, and Yuuri listens intently even as he enjoys the feel of Viktor\u2019s touch. \u201cI had never intended to cause you as much pain as I did\u2026 Yakov has always said I could be too selfish for my own good, but now that I have you\u2026 I know there are some things I need to be more aware of.\u201d\nYuuri gathers up the pieces of his courage to stare Viktor straight in the eye with a steely gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d he admonishes, and feels a flurry of both remorse and delight when Viktor stares back with the saddest of puppy eyes. Honestly, they could even rival Makkachin\u2019s. \u201cWhat you did was really manipulative! I know you told me why, but still, I was so conflicted! Like I said before, you don\u2019t even know how torn I was.\u201d\n\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Viktor says, and his hands slide down Yuuri\u2019s arms to grasp at his hands. \u201cOr, at least, I understand now. I don\u2019t know what to say\u2026\u201d\nYuuri\u2019s eyes soften, and he leans up to give Viktor a gentle peck on the cheek. And then, when his soulmate is fully distracted, Yuuri slides one hand out of Viktor\u2019s grasp and darts it down to Viktor\u2019s side, where he delivers a swift and sturdy pinch.\nViktor yelps, loudly, and Yuuri relentlessly begins to tickle at Viktor\u2019s sides. \n\u201cMercy, mercy!\u201d Viktor wails, and it\u2019s Yuuri\u2019s turn to laugh delightedly, even when he\u2019s flipped over on his back by Viktor in attempt to put a stop to the tickling. \nViktor cages Yuuri, pressing both of the younger man\u2019s hands into either side of the pillow, eyes narrowing in betrayal. \u201cHow mean!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you get!\u201d\n\u201cWell, now I can get my revenge. Was that what you wanted?\u201d\nYuuri snorts, squirming, and Viktor takes the opportunity to nuzzle right into the crook of Yuuri\u2019s neck, nipping at the skin there. Yuuri laughs again, and, finding his hands free, wraps them around Viktor\u2019s back again, clinging onto his soulmate for dear life.\n\u201cAh, Yuuri, I love you!\u201d Viktor coos, and Yuuri freezes. Viktor pauses and lifts his head, cocking his head and beginning to look worried. \u201cAh\u2026 well, I mean\u2014I hope that wasn\u2019t too rushed, but I\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI feel the same,\u201d Yuuri blurts out. \u201cAlways, always, I\u2019ve always admired you, and I\u2019m so lucky I get to have the opportunity to love you!\u201d\nViktor stares down at him, shocked, and it\u2019s Yuuri\u2019s turn to quiet nervously. His worries are assuaged when Viktor flops his full body weight onto him, pressing their lips together in a sound kiss. \n\u201cMine,\u201d Viktor murmurs. \u201cMine, mine, mine. Who cares about what connection? No matter what, I\u2019m sure we were always meant to be.\u201d\n\u201cHow romantic,\u201d Yuuri says, beginning to feel embarrassed. Viktor merely hums in agreement, and Yuuri follows Viktor\u2019s hand with his eyes as the other reaches under the pillows to search for the pen that Yuuri had dropped into the sheets. He\u2019s about to offer to help when Viktor finally finds it, and Viktor raises himself up above Yuuri on one elbow as he uncaps it.\n\u201cStill, I appreciate what the connection gives us. Lately, I\u2019ve enjoyed seeing my handwriting on your skin.\u201d Viktor smiles adoringly as Yuuri watches him draw a heart on his shoulder, and Yuuri\u2019s eyes flick up to Viktor\u2019s to see the same heart drawn in the exact same spot. \n\u201cMe too,\u201d Yuuri agrees quietly, and closes his eyes at the slightly ticklish feel of the pen running across bare skin. \n\u201cWith you and I working together, you\u2019re going to win the Grand Prix.\u201d It feels like Viktor is just drawing aimlessly across skin, and Yuuri stretches out a hand for the pen. At the cold feel of the plastic against his palm, Yuuri opens his eyes to lock eyes with Viktor, who leans down for another kiss. Yuuri\u2019s eyes slide shut again to enjoy the glide of Viktor\u2019s tongue and the soft feel of his lips, before he gently noses Viktor away. \n\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful in and out of the rink,\u201d Viktor says, and Yuuri replies, \u201cbeautiful? That\u2019s you.\u201d\nViktor laughs and presses down to rest his head beside Yuuri\u2019s on the pillow, breath fanning across Yuuri\u2019s face in a satisfied sigh at the feel of the pen on the back of his shoulder.\n\u201cWhat are you writing?\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Viktor sucks\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cHa,\u201d Viktor says cheerfully. \u201cYou adore me! You\u2019ve \u2018always, always admired me, and you\u2019re so lucky you get the opportunity to\u2014\u2018\u201c Viktor yelps again when Yuuri chomps down on Viktor\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOw!\u201d\n\u201cServes you right,\u201d Yuuri says haughtily, and goes back to writing. Viktor chuckles, and his eyelashes tickle Yuuri\u2019s cheek when they fall shut.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll have you know\u2026\u201d Viktor yawns. \u201cI thought you were the most inspiring thing when I first saw you skate my program\u2026 and I\u2019m so lucky I came to Japan.\u201d His voice trails off into a sleepy mumble, and Yuuri smiles. \u201cI love you, Yuuri.\u201d\nViktor is fast asleep before Yuuri can reply, and he caps the pen before carefully turning his head to press a gentle kiss to a sleeping Viktor\u2019s lips. Yuuri is over the moon, and terribly, terribly happy. It had been a long road to get to where they were now, and with everything left unsaid and unwritten finally out in the open\u2026 Yuuri drops the pen over the edge of the bed and turns to wrap his arms around Viktor. Now with all of that out of the way, Yuuri can finally focus on giving one hundred percent on preparing for the road to the Grand Prix.\nHis hand comes up to trace at Viktor\u2019s shoulder blade, where Yuuri knows the words he\u2019d written in reply to Viktor\u2019s declaration are mirrored exactly as they are on his own. Yuuri drifts off to sleep, lulled by Viktor\u2019s steady breathing.\nAnd I\u2026 Yuuri thinks drowsily, fingers tracing the characters that he can\u2019t see, love you too.\n\nI love you so much.\n"
