    "text": "\u00a0\n\u201cMerlin, Harry, point that...thing away from me, would you?\u201d\nScowling, Harry obligingly angles his hips away before scrounging through the files on Ron\u2019s desk. \u201cPiss off,\u201d he grumbles when Ron continues to stare almost fearfully at his crotch, at the tepee that Harry\u2019s cock erection has made in his maroon robes. \u201cRon,\u201d Harry says exasperatedly, \u201cwould you please stop gawking? Fuck, you\u2019re making this whole thing so much worse!\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell did I do?!\u201d Ron\u2019s voice rises shrilly. \u201cYou\u2019re the one strutting about the place waving that thing in everyone\u2019s face \u2013 threatening us all with it!\u201d\n\u201cThreatening?!\u201d\n\u201cYes! It\u2019s not unlike having a wand pointed at you!\u201d Ron has the decency to look sheepish now. \u201cIt\u2019s...unnerving, mate.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s jaw clenches as he grits his teeth, fist closing around several loose sheets of parchment in an old case file as he adjusts his uniform to fall more freely over his front. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry that I\u2019m inconveniencing you all like this. Personally, I\u2019m having a fantastic time walking around with a permanent fucking boner but, fuck, it must be so much harder on you all--\u201d\nRon makes a sound that\u2019s half sympathetic, half impatient. \u201cThis is why you were given permission to go on leave until you--\u201d\n\u201cUntil I what, Ron?\u201d Harry almost yells, finally locating the right file and yanking on it so hard that the folder rips, sheets of neatly arranged parchment spilling out onto the desk, sailing off the edge and onto the floor. Sighing, Harry pinches the bridge of his nose for a moment, lifting his glasses and rubbing at one eye. \u201cLook,\u201d he says wearily, \u201cthis whole fucking thing is mental, and I know some people are fucking laughing at me but, fucking hell, Ron, I can\u2019t just sit at home and wait for this to go away, all right?! I\u2019ll likely cut it off and then kill myself!\u201d\nBecause he\u2019d waited for this to fix itself. He\u2019d waited the whole week following his discharge from Mungo\u2019s.\n\u201cPraestolor de conpar,\u201d the senior Healer had finally proclaimed after fifteen minutes of droning on and on about the hex Harry had been hit with, nodding solemnly as he stared morosely at Harry\u2019s cock tenting the sheets that were drawn up to his waist. \u201cTerribly unfortunate, Auror Potter. Our deepest sympathies.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me,\u201d Harry said serenely, hands clasped over his midriff, \u201cthat this...problem has no actual medical cure?\u201d\n\u201cWe could...drain the phallus,\u201d one of the junior Healers said awkwardly, scratching the back of his neck, his gaze carefully trained away from Harry\u2019s erection.\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s try that then?\u201d Harry requested brightly.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll only provide temporary relief, Auror Potter, and we must warn that it\u2019s an incredibly painful, not to mention inva--\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s. Try. It,\u201d Harry bit out, his smile fixed and completely terrifying.\nFifteen minutes later, Harry had lain curled up on his side, tears of agony dripping off his nose, his whole body shaking from the pain and covered in sweat. \u201cOkay,\u201d he wheezed. \u201cNo more draining, then. Next option?\u201d\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any other options, Auror Potter,\u201d said the senior Healer, sounding more severe than sympathetic now. \u201cThis is ancient, irreversible magic and the hex has likely woven itself around your bones by now. There is nothing you can do but...wait.\u201d\n\u201cWait for what; for whom, my soulmate?!\u201d Harry grit out, baring his teeth at him as he pushed himself up into a half-sit. \u201cThat\u2019s fucking ridiculous! You people are Healers, so heal me! I can\u2019t go about with a fucking stiffy this size for the rest of my life, are you fucking joking?!\u201d Harry was completely hysterical by the end.\n\u201cRest,\u201d he was ordered as he was pushed back down. \u201cI\u2019ll write you a prescription for some sleeping potions, seeing as you\u2019re likely to have some trouble falling asleep with the...\u201d\nHarry had glared so viciously that not a single Healer came back into his room right up until he was discharged.\nAnd then he\u2019d spent a week in his flat, waiting...and wanking.\nIt\u2019ll go away, he\u2019d said to himself on loop, and he\u2019d wanked.\nIt had been far from pleasurable.\nHarry had fisted his cock until it was chaffed and throbbed painfully, the foreskin bright red and sore, his balls aching from the number of dry orgasms he\u2019d thrashed through. His palm felt rough and calloused against the oversensitive shaft and he\u2019d had to put on a wrist brace after a point for how painful and creaky the joint got. Cold showers did nothing but clog up his sinuses, and sleep mostly evaded him because the fucking tent-pole between his legs meant he could never get comfortable, and the aversion he\u2019d developed towards sleeping potions after the war was still strong enough that he couldn\u2019t bring himself to down any of it.\nIt\u2019ll go away, he\u2019d believed all through.\nHe\u2019d eventually tried to simply distract himself; he\u2019d Floo\u2019d over to Ron and Hermione\u2019s, and assembled an infuriatingly complicated crib for Rosie; Ron had been grateful that he didn\u2019t have to suffer through the process, and Hermione had watched Harry in alarm as if worried that he\u2019d suddenly keel over and pass out because of his jutting boner.\n\u201cAre you sure you feel all right, Harry?\u201d she\u2019d asked repeatedly, until Harry and whirled around, glaring, the bulge in his jeans twitching menacingly at her.\n\u201c\u2019Mione,\u201d Harry had hissed, \u201cI told you I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve just spent five days tugging at my now permanently erect penis and my wrist hurts and my balls ache but otherwise, I\u2019m fine. Now, can you confirm whether this piece of shit was supposed to have only three legs because I can\u2019t tell where the actual fuck I\u2019m supposed to shove this fourth one?!\u201d\nAs he\u2019d bid goodbye after dinner, Hermione had stood there wringing her hands. \u201cI\u2019ve read up on Praestolor de Conpar, of course, and it\u2019s primitive and incredibly powerful and--\u201d she sighed sadly, \u201cI suppose now\u2019s the chance for you to really get out there more, to look for someone.\u201d\n\u201cLook for my soulmate, you mean,\u201d Harry said flatly, eyes dull and groin aching.\n\u201cWell, I know that\u2019s what it was made to sound like \u2013 I mean, the hex was created by this witch who had her heart broken by the man she believed was her one true love and, well, she flew into a rage and--\u201d Hermione faltered as Harry sighed tiredly, looking desperately sorry for him. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, the term soulmate is relatively contemporary, yes? A product of...romance novels, and\u2014and movies. The objective theory behind the hex states that you simply need to find the best match for your--\u201d she\u2019d blushed, glancing at his crotch before shaking her head and blinking rapidly, \u201c--for you. The person who\u2019d be the perfect match for you; with whom you\u2019d likely spend your life and--\u201d\n\u201cBecause one of those is easier to find than a soulmate,\u201d Harry had mumbled sadly, helplessly closing a hand over his crotch as his cock started to throb again.\nRon had walked out of the kitchen just then, indignantly squeaking, \u201cOi! Not in front of my wife, what\u2019s wrong with you?!\u201d\n\u201cOh, would you shut it, Ron?!\u201d Harry had yelled back, before Floo\u2019ing home in a strop and angrily masturbating for the remainder of the night.\nNothing had helped; not even picturing Uncle Vernon in frilly, pink knickers, nor McGonagall in thigh high leather boots brandishing a crop, nor Snape in a schoolgirl\u2019s uniform - though all of those mental images had served to make Harry gag loudly and sob, hoarse and dry, into a pillow.\nBut still, he\u2019d believed that it would go away, and had determinedly rejoined work the following Monday despite having being granted as many weeks of paid leave as he may require.\nAll of that had been a week ago. And it still hasn\u2019t gone away.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking you to sit at home and wait for it to go away,\u201d Ron says calmly now, looking up at him steadily, hands laced over his stomach as he lounges low in his chair. \u201cWe\u2019re asking you to go out \u2013 if not to look for your soulmate,\u201d he half shouts as Harry opens his mouth angrily to interrupt, \u201cthen to simply hook up.\u201d He shrugs casually as Harry stares. \u201cSex has got to be better than wanking by yourself, mate. Hermione figures it may even provide longer bouts of relief as compared to wanking.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no relief even with wanking,\u201d Harry murmurs, sounding pained, as he sinks into his chair behind his own desk and tugs off his glasses, rubbing at his eyes. \u201cIt just... It stays hard even after I\u2019ve c--\u201d He breaks off, sighing, not even sure if he\u2019s embarrassed anymore.\n\u201cHave you slept with anyone at all since th--?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry cuts in, bored. \u201cI haven\u2019t had my cock in a bloke\u2019s arse in the longest fucking time and if that by itself doesn\u2019t tell you how hopeless this whole thi--\u201d Harry\u2019s increasingly feverish rant is cut short as there\u2019s a sharp knock on the ajar door and it\u2019s pushed open.\nMalfoy walks in, his rectangular, frameless glasses perched on the tip of his nose as he peers closely at a long scroll in his right hand, an enormous pile of colourfully labelled files clutched in the crook of his left arm. He\u2019s garbed in neatly pressed grey trousers with a spotless white shirt tucked in, crimson and bronze striped tie knotted in a perfect double Windsor. His hair is as pale and shiny as ever, combed neatly into place, just a few errant strands falling across his brow. A fancy eagle feather quill is tucked behind one pink ear and there\u2019s a smudge of green ink on his razor sharp nose.\nNot for the first time, Harry observes that Malfoy is unfairly cute, and it\u2019s not even the effects of the fucking hex that brings forth this review. Malfoy is just genuinely very pretty. And way, way out of Harry\u2019s league.\nHe simply stands there, mouth working silently as he reads, for several seconds before looking up, scowling irritably into the silence of Harry and Ron\u2019s office, as if he\u2019d been rudely interrupted. \u201cDo you both have the week\u2019s reports ready for me or not?\u201d he snaps, even as he watches Ron gather up an armful of files.\nRon rolls his eyes as he rounds his desk, pausing for a moment next to Harry\u2019s to collect an additional two folders, before going and roughly dumping the whole pile into Malfoy\u2019s arms.\nScrambling slightly, struggling not to drop the ridiculously large armload, Malfoy bares his teeth at Ron, his glare intensifying when his reading glasses suddenly slip off his nose and skitter onto the floor.\nRon simply sniggers, grabbing a three day-old, half empty packet of crisps from under a pile of ripped envelopes on Harry\u2019s desk and returning to his seat. Malfoy makes a thoroughly annoyed sound as he peeks over the top of the pile of folders he\u2019s holding to look for his glasses.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d he waggles a finger, still clamped around the files, in the vague direction of his specs, \u201cif you\u2019d be so kind?\u201d Carefully remaining seated, Harry waves a hand, levitating the delicate spectacles onto the top of the pile Malfoy holds. He receives a tiny, businesslike smile for it. \u201cMuch obliged. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be indisposed and on leave?\u201d he asks Harry, head tilting slightly so some more of his neatly combed fringe slides further onto his face.\nSliding his groin deeper under his desk, Harry shakes his head vigorously. \u201cNo, I\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d\n\u201cYou did take some sort of hex that left you permanently disfigured?\u201d Malfoy confirms curiously. Ron hacks loudly through a mouthful of limp crisps.\nShooting him a glare, Harry shakes his head again. \u201cNot disfigured, no,\u201d he chuckles weakly. When Malfoy simply continues to stare expectantly at him, Harry wheezes, \u201cI\u2019m fine, really.\u201d\nMalfoy shrugs, turning away with his precariously placed pile of paperwork and, as he trots out, Harry pretends not to be nearly overwhelmed by the perfect rotundity of his bubble bum \u2013 were they even permitted to wear such snug trousers?!\n\u201cSex,\u201d Harry mutters vaguely, one hand unconsciously straying to his cock, thumb stroking the straining bulge. \u201cI ought to have some.\u201d\nRon looks extremely relieved. \u201cThere\u2019s this bloke George hired to help with the shop,\u201d he says brightly at once. \u201cSamuel something. Should I...er\u2014Will you be doing like a dinner or something first? Or\u2014you know, just straight away--?\u201d He gestures to where Harry\u2019s cock is standing at full mast under his desk.\nHarry stares, exasperated. \u201cI have my doubts about Samuel something being my soulmate, but I still don\u2019t intend to take him straight to bed to bugger senseless, Ron.\u201d\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s a yes, then? Shall I ask George to get him to owl you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, whatever,\u201d Harry says miserably, burying his face in his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I\u2019m going to go out and do any better myself.\u201d\n\u201cWell?\u201d Ron leans forward excitedly, chair creaking under him. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d\n\u201cGreat. We plan to get married next spring.\u201d Harry slams his mug of tea on his desk before throwing himself into his chair. His hips have begun to ache now, along with his thighs nearly always trembling from the strain of walking around with a rock hard cock that bobs eagerly under his robes that have been deliberately altered to a size too big.\nRon looks astonished. \u201cWait, really?\u201d\nHarry clicks his tongue irritably as he picks up his tea. \u201cNo, Ron! The guy\u2019s a fucking nutter, okay? You set me up with a fucking nutter. He wanted me to brush his hair and pretend he was a cat while he licked my toes or something.\u201d Harry takes an angry chug of oversweet tea while Ron makes a choking sound into one fist, face steadily reddening as he carefully swallows his laughter.\nAfter several seconds of furious gulping, Ron asks with forced nonchalance, \u201cSo...you didn\u2019t fuck him then?\u201d\n\u201cWell, of course I fucked him,\u201d Harry replies blandly, pulling the day\u2019s load of paperwork towards himself with a sigh. \u201cSort of the whole point, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cWas it after or before you...er, petted him?\u201d\n\u201cHow does it matter?\u201d Harry snorts, raising his eyebrows, adjusting himself with a hiss of discomfort. \u201cThe point is that I fucked him for four hours straight and I\u2019m still--\u201d\n\u201cMy, my, Potter,\u201d drawls a posh, terribly familiar voice from the doorway and Harry jerks, looking around with his face heating so quickly that he can feel sweat starting to bead on his brow. Malfoy leans one shoulder on the doorframe, crisp, slim-cut robes in a pale, sky blue cascading down his willowy frame as he lounges there and smirks, grey eyes gleaming with wicked glee. \u201cBusy weekend?\u201d\n\u201cShove off, Malfoy,\u201d Ron says loudly, while Harry splutters and tries not to die of embarrassment. \u201cGo annoy someone else, it\u2019s too early on a fucking Monday to look at your pointy mug.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I can always come back later for the details,\u201d Malfoy retorts airily. \u201cPotter doesn\u2019t seem to mind giving those out. Four hours straight, Potter?\u201d And then with a snigger, \u201cAre you on stamina potions of some sort?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I mean--\u201d Harry\u2019s face matches his uniform now. In his pants, his cock spurts out a dribble of precome at the exact same moment Malfoy absently licks his lips.\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Malfoy, what the fuck do you want?\u201d Ron demands rudely, slamming a fist on his desk, his own mug of tea rattling noisily.\n\u201cAbsolutely nothing,\u201d Malfoy answers smoothly. \u201cI was simply walking by when I heard something about Potter fucking a cat--\u201d\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Harry bursts out, completely mortified. \u201cMalfoy, I\u2014I did not fuck a cat, I swear it wasn\u2019t--\u201d But Malfoy is laughing now, rounded shoulders shaking as he throws his head back and chortles loudly, eyes twinkling with mischief, cheeks pink with amusement. Harry stares.\n\u201cDo unclench, Potter,\u201d he teases, straightening up and brushing his hands down his wonderfully clingy robes. \u201cI\u2019ve been pulling your leg for over a decade and a half now. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s about time you learn to recognise it, if not learned to come up with a halfway intelligent retort?\u201d\n\u201cFucking tosser,\u201d Ron mutters irritably as Malfoy saunters away, still chuckling. Harry discreetly grinds into the front of his pants, Malfoy\u2019s pink cheeks and shiny eyes still dancing before him. \u201cOi, so are you meeting the cat-bloke again?\u201d\nHarry promptly stops grinding, slumping forward with a groan. \u201cWhat do you think, Ron?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not...?\u201d\n\u201cTen points to Gryffindor.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about that Andre fellow you used to Floo for a quickie every now and then?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in over three years. I think he\u2019s engaged now, on top of that.\u201d\n\u201cShit, do you realise how pathetic your social life is, mate?\u201d\n\u201cI will come over there and fuck you if you don\u2019t shut up,\u201d Harry says smoothly, straightening up and draining his mug of tea as Ron accidentally breaks his and splutters indecipherably for the next three minutes.\nThe water\u2019s too hot as it sluices down his body; yet he doesn\u2019t move or make to adjust the temperature any. He stands there, head bowed against the jets, eyes shut, hair hanging into his face, his palms braced against the tiles, shoulders slumped inwards.\nHis legs feel weak and overused, quivering under him, and his hips are creaky and sore. His back aches, spine clicking dully every time he stretches it out, and the long tracks that have been scratched down the length of his back burn under the extreme heat.\nHis prick juts out from his body, flushed dark red and twitching every few seconds from the need to be touched, veins bulging alarmingly along the thick length. Harry can still feel the soft pressure around it, clamped tight and damp. He can still hear the loud, wet sounds of lube and precome with every pump of his hips, every thrust of his cock messily squelching out the thick, sticky mixture out the arse of his date from earlier that day, the loud, deliberately wanton moans still echoing through his head, making him grit his teeth and roll his eyes much like he had while he\u2019d still been in the act of fucking him.\nMaybe one of the effects of the hex was that he\u2019d never enjoy sex again, even while remaining permanently hard. He can\u2019t think of any other reason as to why he hadn\u2019t enjoyed it; why he\u2019d rushed through the whole thing. It had felt wrong; forced \u2013 which it sort of was, if you consider the fact that he\u2019d pushed himself to go on that lunch date and flirt aggressively until he was invited back to his date\u2019s house where he got right down to business.\nHe hadn\u2019t even kissed the bloke.\nHe spends the rest of the evening slumped on the sofa in his bathrobe, with a bottle of Ogden\u2019s balanced on one thigh as he drinks and wanks himself into a stupor. When there\u2019s a loud pounding on his door just after seven pm, Harry grimaces and holds his hands over his ears, whimpering in the direction of the noise.\n\u201cGo away,\u201d he whines.\n\u201cHarry, open the fucking door!\u201d Ron bellows.\n\u201cWe know you\u2019re in there, Harry, we can feel it in your wards!\u201d Hermione calls out.\nAfter a significant amount of time spent fumbling around for his wand, Harry cleans himself up and pulls down his locking charms with several clicks that are very loud in the quiet stillness of his flat.\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re alive!\u201d Ron says, scowling as he strides in and spots Harry curled up into a miserable ball on the sofa. \u201cI thought I asked you to Floo when you get back from your date. What the fuck happened? Merlin, it smells like spunk coated bollocks in here,\u201d he adds, pinching his nose with two fingers and pointedly hurrying over to open a window.\nHermione perches on the sofa chair across from Harry and watches him worriedly. \u201cDid you even go on the date?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry answers dully; he\u2019s not wearing his glasses and Hermione is a very blurred, bushy-headed shape floating in front of him.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d she prods gently.\nHarry shrugs. \u201c\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cStill hard?\u201d Ron enquires stupidly.\nHarry slants him a weary glare before pointedly indicating to his groin; he\u2019d clumsily pulled his bathrobe shut just as the two of them walked in and it now resembled a terry tent.\n\u201cI\u2019ll make tea,\u201d Ron grunts, ears pink, before wandering away to the kitchen, the sound of the kettle filling slightly jarring in the ensuing silence.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019re going through, you know,\u201d Hermione pipes up softly. \u201cWe both are.\u201d\n\u201cAre you?\u201d Harry raises his voice slightly in the direction of the kitchen, and he hears Ron\u2019s impatient tch.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be comfortable for you,\u201d Hermione acknowledges, waving a hand at his crotch. \u201cYou look awful,\u201d she adds, gaze roving over the dark half-moons under his eyes that plunge halfway down to his cheeks, the way he\u2019d paled, his skin tinged with grey, the way his hair is almost frighteningly out of control.\n\u201cI feel awful, \u2018Mione,\u201d Harry admits, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes and rubbing vigorously. \u201cI\u2019ve barely slept in over three weeks, I can hardly think half the time with this--\u201d he angles both hands downwards to point furiously at his erection, \u201c\u2014and I doubt I\u2019m ever going to find someone anyway, so that makes it all the more--\u201d\n\u201cWait, what d\u2019you mean?\u201d Hermione interrupts, frowning. \u201cWhy d\u2019you feel like you\u2019re never going to find someone?\u201d\n\u201cI never had much hope in the first place, all right?\u201d Harry says impatiently, leaning his head against the back of the sofa. \u201cEven before this fucking mess \u2013 I never actually thought there\u2019d be this one guy whom I\u2019d find and\u2014and... You know? I don\u2019t know if there is someone out there for me.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nHarry snorts. \u201cHave you met me?\u201d he asks sarcastically. \u201cHave you noticed what my life\u2019s been like so far? When has it ever been all roses and sunshine for me?\u201d\n\u201cHarry, I\u2019m sorry for everything you\u2019ve been through, I am, but none of that is even pertinent to you finding someone to fall in love with,\u201d Hermione says flatly all in one breath. \u201cI know this hex has left you in a mess, but you can\u2019t just sit here feeling hopeless and sorry for yourself. Of course you\u2019re not going to find someone perfectly suited for you just after...what, you\u2019ve been on three dates so far? I\u2019m sorry none of those men were it for you, but I\u2019m also pretty sure you didn\u2019t want any of them to be.\u201d\n\u201cNone of them would\u2019ve bothered with me if not for my name,\u201d Harry mumbles, squashing his cock down with a cushion and wincing.\n\u201cAnd your giant boner,\u201d Ron supplies from the kitchen.\nHermione tuts. \u201cIsn\u2019t there anyone you fancy? Who jumps to mind immediately?\u201d\nHarry deliberately doesn\u2019t permit his brain to process that. \u201cNo,\u201d he answers at once.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Hermione sighs, \u201cnothing to do but wait, I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cWait, and in the meantime what?\u201d Harry snaps. \u201cWhy is everybody asking me to fucking wait? What do you suggest I do while I wait? Fuck my way through all of London in the hopes of finding him? What is this? Some fucked up version of Cinderella? Oh, shit,\u201d he groans, \u201cThis is like Cinderella, isn\u2019t it?! Like Cinderella, but with cock. Cock instead of slippers.\u201d\n\u201cThe very premise of that stupid story is flawed in my opinion,\u201d Ron says loftily as he walks in with the loaded tea tray following him in wonky bounces midair. \u201cI mean, how thick does that fucking prince have to be that he can\u2019t remember the bird\u2019s face? He did spend a whole evening necking with her, right?\u201d He hands out their mugs of tea as Harry and Hermione turn to him, amused. \u201cWasn\u2019t she the most beautiful woman in the whole kingdom or something? Then how come he had to rely on fucking shoes made out of glass \u2013 who makes shoes out of glass?! \u2013 instead of just looking the woman in the face and recognising her as the one who gave him a raging stiffy? What an utter shit. Muggles have some fucked up literature, man.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he had a foot fetish,\u201d Harry suggests lamely, finally cracking a crooked smile.\n\u201cIn all probability,\u201d Ron agrees, nodding and grinning as he lifts his mug to Harry. \u201cSo, you want to put out an ad to help you find the arse that best fits your cock?\u201d\nEven Hermione dissolves into giggles at that, and Harry can do nothing but sip his tea and glare sullenly at the pair of them while the cushion in his lap dances with each twitch of his poor, hexed cock.\nHe loves bartenders, Harry decides. Nobody else would serve him an eighth Firewhiskey on ice without even blinking, the way the tall, thin witch with the dozen moving tattoos along her arms and shoulders does.\nHarry smiles weakly at her as she swaps his empty glass for a fresh drink, wondering if he ought to have stumbled to the loo first for a quick wank-break before ordering this round.\nDrinking, he decides additionally, is infinitely preferable to going on another futile date that would end in mediocre, passionless sex that left him feeling slightly nauseous. Developing a drinking problem is what he should focus on. Fuck soulmates \u2013 especially his own.\n\u201cHello, grumpy.\u201d\nThe soft, smooth greeting is in a voice that is easily familiar and startling in its pleasantness.\nHarry turns his head, vision swimming slightly. \u201cMalf...oy?\u201d he slurs, blinking in bewilderment at the long, pale form as he folds himself onto the stool next to Harry's.\nHarry\u2019s cock twitches.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Malfoy nods, a single tip of his shiny head, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were a drunk.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Harry replies at once. \u201cWell, not yet anyway.\u201d He squints slightly, pushing his glasses up his nose and blinking as Malfoy finally comes into proper focus, his expression one of wry amusement. \u201cWhat\u2019re you\u2014what\u2019re you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Malfoy eyes go round, \u201cI didn\u2019t realise this place was reserved only for Golden Prats.\u201d\nHarry rests his head in one hand, forgetting to reply for several seconds as he simply stares at Malfoy with a soft, loopy smile that slowly spreads across his face until he\u2019s grinning at him like a stupid goof. Malfoy looks away, taking a few sips of his drink and ignoring him for a long while before turning back to him with an impatient, \u201cOkay, what? Is it really a problem if I sit here?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Harry is quick to say. \u201cI\u2019d never have thought you\u2019d sit beside me anyway.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you and I both, Potter,\u201d Malfoy says, lips quirking slightly. Then, slightly more seriously, \u201cAre you all right? Where\u2019s Weasley?\u201d\nHarry shrugs. \u201cWe do sometimes go out separately, you know?\u201d\n\u201cHard to believe,\u201d Malfoy says lightly. \u201cI was under the impression that the Weasel was your personal bodyguard.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry bobs his head with a sardonic smirk, \u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s been known to strut around flanked by bodyguards. Sure.\u201d\nMalfoy flushes slightly, scowling even as he purses his lips over a smile. \u201cGreg and Vince were my friends, you arse.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Harry repeats, laughing as Malfoy shoves one sharp elbow into his arm.\n\u201cMerlin, you really are still an arse,\u201d Malfoy says, picking up his tall glass of something clear and lemony, taking a long sip. Harry watches as his throat bobs when he swallows \u2013 and then he\u2019s simply staring at Malfoy\u2019s neck \u2013 the long, graceful length of it, the pale, unblemished skin. It\u2019s that sort of neck that would only look prettier with half a dozen hickeys dotting it.\nHarry\u2019s prick jumps again.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you staring at?\u201d Malfoy\u2019s stunning blush is back, a touch of pique to his tone as he turns to him once more.\n\u201cYou,\u201d Harry blurts out, before sighing and adjusting the bundle of his work robes in his lap. \u201cWhy\u2019d you have to go and get so hot?\u201d he mumbles mournfully into his own drink. \u201c\u2019s really distracting.\u201d\nWhen he steals a quick peek, Malfoy is staring at him with his mouth hanging open, looking completely gobsmacked. \u201cMerlin, Potter!\u201d he hisses, colour leaking down his neck and across the little sliver of his collarbones that\u2019s visible beneath the collar of his cream button-down, where his tie has been loosened some. \u201cHow drunk are you?\u201d\n\u201cDrunk,\u201d Harry confirms flatly. \u201cJust drunk enough.\u201d\n\u201cDrunk enough for?\u201d Malfoy\u2019s gaze is fixed on the slice of lemon floating around in his glass, but Harry can see how his knuckles are sticking out white and sharp where he\u2019s gripping his glass too tightly.\nHarry can feel his boner lean hopefully in Malfoy\u2019s direction.\n\u00a0\u201cTo buy you a drink, maybe,\u201d Harry says without thinking.\n\u201cI already have a drink, Potter.\u201d\nHarry reaches over and backhands the glass out of Malfoy\u2019s hand, sending it flying over the bar. Malfoy blinks at him in shock as the tinkle of breaking glass sounds, the barest suggestion of a smile on the corners of his pink mouth. \u201cDrink, Malfoy?\u201d\nWhen Malfoy\u2019s fresh glass of gin and tonic is back between his pale, spidery hands, he slants Harry a long, inscrutable look. \u201cTrust you to be an obnoxiously charming drunk.\u201d\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m charming, Malfoy?\u201d Harry\u2019s cheek is resting in one hand, his body leaning into Malfoy\u2019s personal space with no conscious effort to do so.\n\u201cObnoxiously so,\u201d Malfoy responds, carefully not meeting his eyes, voice decidedly breathy. \u201cIs this why you were here alone tonight, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cIs what why I was here alone?\u201d\nMalfoy smirks, gaze sharp and merciless. \u201cTo pull.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Harry tilts his head, returning the same sly smile, \u201cI didn\u2019t realise you were available to pull.\u201d\nMalfoy swallows hard enough that Harry actually hears him gulp. \u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t say I was.\u201d\n\u201cSo say you are.\u201d\n\u201cHow d\u2019you know I am?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s hand is suddenly on Malfoy\u2019s thigh. \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he admits quietly. \u201cI hope you are though.\u201d He lets his hand squeeze, very briefly, and enough to draw a soft gasp from Malfoy, before pulling back.\nMalfoy breathes steadily, the pause stretching on and on before he says, \u201cAnother couple of drinks, and I think I will be.\u201d\nMalfoy doesn\u2019t wear pants, Harry is more than a little pleasantly surprised to find out, an hour later.\nHe\u2019s got Malfoy\u2019s crisp black trousers down past his slim, silken thighs, and there\u2019s nothing else in between Harry\u2019s desperately groping hands and Malfoy\u2019s sinfully perfect, deliciously round bum as he grabs two handfuls of the taut, supple flesh and kneads.\nHarry\u2019s head still swims lightly, the whiskey burning through him with every pump of his furiously thumping heart. His cock is oozing slick, wetting the front of his pants and seeping slowly through his trousers.\nMalfoy gasps as Harry\u2019s erection stabs his hip. \u201cFuck, you\u2019re already--\u201d He suddenly gasps again, breaking off as Harry pushes his face into his neck and takes a firm mouthful to suck. \u201cI never do this, fuck, but I never do this--\u201d he rants feverishly under his breath, one hand tangling in Harry\u2019s hair, the other winding its way between them to close around the painfully straining bulge that is Harry\u2019s boner.\nHarry groans into the bruise he\u2019s sucked, immediately rutting into Malfoy\u2019s hand, his whole body burning with sensation. \u201cWhat don\u2019t you do, Malfoy?\u201d he remembers to ask after a second, yanking aside Malfoy\u2019s collar some more so he can bite into the soft crook of his neck.\nMalfoy whines. \u201cTh-this,\u201d he breathes, tugging Harry\u2019s cock in a rolling swirl. \u201cY\u2019know... Let someone get me pissed and then let them snog me in a back alley.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not just someone,\u201d Harry pulls back and says seriously, dark gaze sweeping over Malfoy\u2019s flushed cheeks and wet mouth, his pupils round and black within the pale grey irises. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t snogged you yet.\u201d\n\u201cSo let\u2019s fix that,\u201d Malfoy whispers, yanking Harry\u2019s head forward with the hand still caught in his hair.\nTheir mouths meet in a ferociously hungry, terribly messy kiss, teeth clacking together too hard, tongues writhing wetly against each other. Harry can taste the zing of Malfoy\u2019s drink on his tongue and growls as he winds a hand in Malfoy\u2019s blond hair and roughly angles his face into place so he can shove his tongue further in. Malfoy moans, his hand tightening painfully around Harry\u2019s erection, making Harry buck in shock and bite down too hard on Malfoy\u2019s lip.\nMalfoy hisses, a short, sharp intake of breath through clenched teeth, and jerks away, but Harry\u2019s hand is only fisting more firmly in his hair, drawing him right back in and kissing him so hard that Malfoy\u2019s head slams back into the rough brick wall. Harry can barely even stand at the moment, his cock practically vibrating with the need for further stimulation. Malfoy is warm and pliant and gorgeous in his arms and Harry feels as though he\u2019s slowly unravelling, mind and body.\nWhimpering now, Malfoy finally pulls his hand free from between them, choosing instead to carefully angle his own freshly risen cock so it\u2019s slotted against Harry\u2019s still clothed erection, and grind.\nThat by itself is sufficient to make Harry release his mouth and drop his forehead onto Malfoy\u2019s shoulder, letting out a rough sound that comes out as more of a sob. Malfoy swivels his hips, repeating the firm grind into Harry\u2019s cock and Harry shudders, the pleasure almost too much, too intense.\n\u201cFuck, yes,\u201d he grits out, wrapping both arms around Malfoy\u2019s waist and squeezing. \u201cFucking hold on,\u201d he growls, and doesn\u2019t wait for Malfoy to finish wrapping his arms securely around his shoulders before Disapparating.\nHe has Malfoy cheek-first against the wall, his trousers pooled around his feet, about three seconds after they land in Harry\u2019s front hallway.\n\u201cFuck! Potter, fuck!\u201d Malfoy sounds almost panicked as Harry\u2019s finger finds his arsehole, but the way he presses back into his hand doesn\u2019t leave room for doubt or pause.\nNot that Harry even pauses. His erection is downright painful as he pulls it out, more actual pain than pleasure, and Harry is desperate as he slicks his fingers and swipes them against the soft furl of Malfoy\u2019s entrance. \u201cFuck, please, Malfoy,\u201d he coats his erection liberally and lines up, \u201cplease fucking let me, I\u2019m so sorry, oh shit, please--\u201d\nHe\u2019s pressing in even before he\u2019s finished pleading with him, and Malfoy keens, a high, tremulous note, when the bulging, purpled head of Harry\u2019s cock slips into him with an audible pop.\nIt\u2019s nothing like the other encounters Harry\u2019s had in the past couple of weeks.\nMalfoy\u2019s arse pulls him inside, the unbearably tight channel giving way, opening up, as his wildly twitching cock ploughs in. Harry doesn\u2019t even have to pull out and start thrusting before he\u2019s spilling into Malfoy, gasping out his climax into the neck he\u2019d bruised a few minutes ago.\nMalfoy, meanwhile, is howling up at the ceiling, and when Harry frantically reaches around to check, he sags with relief to find that not only is Malfoy still hard, but is now leaking out long dribbles of precome, fucking his fist in frantic little bucks, hips moving as much as feasible within the tight space between Harry and the wall.\n\u201cPotter, fuck, please!\u201d he shrieks, as Harry pulls out and shoves back in once, then again, and another time, before rucking up the rumpled cream shirt, grasping his hips and yanking them outwards. His own come slicks the way as he then proceeds to pound into Malfoy, over and over again, huffing out a breathless guffaw as Malfoy scrabbles viciously at the wall and screams, \u201cMerlin\u2019s fucking bollocks!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re into balls, then?\u201d Harry murmurs, releasing Malfoy\u2019s prick to reach further below and locate his wildly swinging balls and tug, thrusting steadily into the wet heat of Malfoy\u2019s arse, hips pumping so hard that they bounce right off the fleshy softness of his bum. \u201cD\u2019you enjoy having a pair in your mouth, Malfoy?\u201d\nMalfoy moans, bracing both hands against the wall and rocking back onto Harry\u2019s cock. \u201cI could\u2019ve\u2014sworn you\u2014came just now, Potter,\u201d he says, fighting to breathe as Harry further picks up pace. \u201cShit, right there\u2014there! Potter, there, don\u2019t stop, keep--\u201d he groans helplessly into one arm, \u201c\u2014keep going, Potter!\u201d he manages in a high wheeze.\n\u201cGo\u2019ng t\u2019go all night, Malfoy,\u201d Harry promises roughly, grabbing his cock once more and pumping swiftly. \u201cAll fucking night--\u201d he squeezes his prick under the head as Malfoy emits a garbled shout and starts to come all over his hand, \u201c\u2014until you fucking pass out.\u201d\n\u201cPotter!\u201d Malfoy\u2019s hand closes over Harry\u2019s on his prick as Harry continues to massage the final few trickles out of him. \u201cFuck, you bastard--\u201d\n\u201c\u2019swhat I\u2019m doing, Malfoy,\u201d Harry snarls, finally pulling his hand back, grabbing Malfoy\u2019s hips again and fucking Malfoy into the wall until he\u2019s coming a second time into his burning hot, pulsating arse.\n\u201cStill feel those drinks, Malfoy?\u201d Harry asks after his cock has stopped throbbing, dragging in lungfuls of citrusy air with his face pressed into Malfoy\u2019s hair.\n\u201cJust about,\u201d Malfoy replies weakly.\n\u201cGood. I wasn\u2019t joking earlier. I\u2019m not nearly done with you.\u201d\nHaving Malfoy in his bed, naked and spread-eagled, is somewhat like becoming aware of himself in the middle of a particularly good dream and then immediately worrying about waking up before it\u2019s finished in a satisfactory and fulfilling manner.\nThe sheer regularity with which Harry has imagined this in the past couple of years is not in any way sufficient to prepare him to deal with it in a composed, suave manner. \u00a0He devours Malfoy, kissing him and kissing him until he frantically shoves at Harry and pulls away reddened, swollen lips, whimpering unintelligibly up at him, thighs falling open wider as Harry ruts his still erect, dripping wet cock against the inside of one.\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d Harry murmurs, nuzzling into his sharp collarbones before running the flat of his tongue up the length of his neck, kissing his jumping Adam\u2019s apple and gnawing at his perfect jaw. \u201cFuck, are you okay? Did I--?\u201d\n\u201c\u2019m fine,\u201d Malfoy interrupts, twitching as Harry\u2019s teeth move further up to graze against the sensitive little cranny below his ear, sighing as his earlobe is then suckled at. \u201cShould\u2019ve known you\u2019d be like this in bed too.\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Harry pulls back when Malfoy doesn\u2019t answer, \u201cLike what, Malfoy?\u201d\nMalfoy blinks, gaze unfocused. \u201cLike... Like the world might end unless you don\u2019t put your whole being into whatever it is that you\u2019re doing.\u201d\nHarry snorts, mouth spreading into a wide grin before he leans back down for another kiss.\nThis one lasts long enough that Harry loses track of time, slow and scorching, Malfoy\u2019s legs wound around his hips, his nails hooked into the dampness of Harry\u2019s back; this time when Harry pulls away, Malfoy drags him back in for more.\n\u201cTell me what you want,\u201d Harry breathes, finally drawing away long enough to be able to talk. \u201cTell me how you want to\u2014tell me what you want.\u201d\n\u201cDid you even lose this?\u201d Malfoy wonders out loud, shifting his leg in a slow rub against Harry\u2019s cock. When Harry doesn\u2019t answer, Malfoy smirks, rolling them over and slithering down to inspect it more closely.\nHarry can feel Malfoy\u2019s breath against his cock, quick and warm, as it huffs over his shaft. Malfoy\u2019s thumb lazily traces the ridge under the head, before pressing in an unhurried slide down the bulging vein, all the way to his balls. \u201cWow,\u201d Malfoy whispers suddenly, lapping away a little bead of moisture that leaks out, wrapping his hand around and drawing the folds of his foreskin down. \u201cConsider me impressed, Potter.\u201d\nMalfoy sucks his cock with a practised ease, one hand wrapped firmly around the base, the other playing with his balls, his lips sealed in firm suction as he moves his head in long, controlled bobs.\nHarry, relatively less tipsy than he was earlier, who\u2019s still struggling to process that he has Malfoy in his bed, freshly fucked by him, and sucking his cock now, fights not to buck up into his glorious mouth, forcing himself to lie flat and still, legs shifting restlessly on either side of Malfoy. For the first time in days, in weeks, he isn\u2019t thinking about the Praestolor de conpar.\nBecause Malfoy is licking at his balls now, pulling them turn by turn into his mouth and lightly pinching the thin skin between his lips. He\u2019s rubbing the smooth, spongy head of Harry\u2019s cock around his mouth, down over his chin and up along one cheek, leaving shiny trails of slimy precome that glisten in the moonlight pouring in the from the window.\n\u201cWhat do you want, Potter?\u201d Malfoy murmurs against the thatch of tight black curls, his hand moving in loose pumps along the shaft.\n\u201cGod,\u201d Harry bucks up wildly into the teasing grip of his hand, \u201cto fuck you again; come up here.\u201d\nMalfoy obliges willingly enough, smirking into the flat, quivering plane of Harry\u2019s belly, tongue running up along the trail of dark hair to his navel, which it then dips into. He applies teeth every now and then on his way up, leaving bright red spots behind, teasing one dark nipple with his tongue incessantly until Harry manhandles him onto him back once more, snarling into his mouth for another loud kiss.\nWeak, breathy moans sound as Harry marks Malfoy\u2019s throat some more, sinking his teeth in and viciously sucking blood up until his skin stands out in mottled red and purple. Malfoy gasps, arching high, pressing his chest into Harry\u2019s mouth as he sucks on tight, pebbled pink nipples, pulling the reddened tip in between his teeth and flicking his tongue over the throbbing nubs until Malfoy is sobbing with each helpless jerk of his body.\nHe tastes Malfoy\u2019s cock, pulling the slender, rosy length into his mouth and sucking until it juts out stiff and wet, as hard and desperate as Harry\u2019s own still rampant erection. He caresses Malfoy\u2019s arsehole, gleaming wet and winking up at him as he conjures and carefully fingers lube into him.\nWhen Malfoy\u2019s arse is drooling lube and spasming open around Harry\u2019s thrusting fingers, he crawls over him and lines up, bending Malfoy in half as he slings his knees over his shoulders.\n\u201cReady?\u201d he breathes, reaching down and thumbing himself into place.\nMalfoy, flushed and sweaty, eyes slightly crossed, mouth wet and gasping open, says, \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask the first time, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I? Oops.\u201d Harry smiles and presses into Malfoy, slipping in wet and easy, both of them muffling moans of sheer bliss against each other\u2019s mouths. When Harry starts a patient, leisurely rut into the greedy clench of his arse, Malfoy throws his head back and lets his eyes fall shut, his breath leaving him in short, sharp bursts.\nThey move as one, Harry\u2019s hips never stopping, never pausing, Malfoy\u2019s hands in his hair, and his quiet whines of pleasure keeping Harry going for way longer than he\u2019d ever thought he could go. The sounds they both make are low and desperate, their grip on one another never loosening, but the pace that Harry sets doesn\u2019t speed up, doesn\u2019t turn demanding.\nThat is until Malfoy\u2019s hands fly up into his own sweat-heavy blond locks, his eyes rolling back into his head, his mouth sagging wide open as he garbles, \u201cPotter, please,\u201d bucking up ineffectively under Harry\u2019s heated weight.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry\u2019s hips move quicker now, \u201cFuck, yes, Malfoy--\u201d\nThe pressure around his cock becomes unendurable as Malfoy bursts into sudden orgasm, his arse clamping vice like around him as he cries out and thrashes, their stomachs sliding together as Malfoy comes in long, endless jets.\n\u201cYes, fuck, Potter, come in me--\u201d\nAnd Harry does; he pounds hard enough into him that the bed crashes into the wall and the mattress bounces, and he fucks an orgasm so spectacularly intense into Malfoy, that for several seconds, all he sees is white and all he hears is some sort of keening static that he then realises is his own hoarse screaming.\nMalfoy\u2019s entire body is sweat slippery and trembling under him, his sharp, breathless whimpers cutting into Harry\u2019s own rough panting. They\u2019re entwined tightly together, all four of Malfoy\u2019s limbs coiled tightly around Harry, his face burrowed into the crook of Harry\u2019s neck as he hiccups softly.\nHarry\u2019s insides feel liquefied \u2013 his brain especially. He can\u2019t even begin to process the enormous fucking fact that he\u2019s had sex (twice!) with Draco sodding Malfoy. His back feels sore, his legs stiff and heavy, and eventually, his cock slips out, wet and soft, of Malfoy\u2019s arse.\n...Wait, what?\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Harry leaps backwards, flying off the bed so violently that he ends up slamming the back of his head into the wall opposite the bed. Malfoy shrieks, scrambling up, endless arms and legs flailing about wildly, pale hair mussed beyond recognition. He sits up in a kneel, looking around the room as though expecting to be violently attacked, before glaring at Harry with irritated incredulity.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he snaps. \u201cWhat the fuck is it? What happened?!\u201d\nHarry is staring down at his cock \u2013 his cock that\u2019s hanging limp and heavy between his slightly sticky thighs. At Malfoy\u2019s sharp tone, he looks up, gaping at him in silence until Malfoy makes another sound of vexation.\n\u201cPotter, what?!\u201d\n\u201cMy cock,\u201d Harry says blankly, \u201cmy cock is soft.\u201d\nThe look of disbelief Malfoy shoots him serves to make Harry snap out of it some \u2013 just slightly. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d Malfoy dips his head, looking at Harry as though he\u2019s the dumbest, most obtuse half-wit alive. \u201cYour cock is soft?\u201d he repeats, one eyebrow hooking upwards. \u201cIs that a completely unnecessary observation you\u2019re sharing with me, or do you genuinely not know how sex works?\u201d When Harry continues to stare with his mouth hanging open, he declares hotly, \u201cYou came thrice in the last hour! Of course your stupid, fucking cock is soft! It\u2019s finally soft, Merlin!\u201d\n\u201cPraestolor de conpar,\u201d Harry says dimly, \u201cit\u2019s...gone.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Malfoy asks impatiently, looking more and more frustrated with each passing second. \u201cPotter, what are you--?\u201d he breaks off, sighing and running a hand through his hair, \u201cShit, I knew there\u2019d be some enormous fucking downside to doing this with you,\u201d he mutters irritably. \u201cYou\u2019re a goddamn basket case.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Malfoy, it\u2019s not like--!\u201d Harry hurries forward, placing one knee on the bed and grasping his cock. Excitement and relief of such immense magnitude fill him that he doesn\u2019t quite register grasping his cock and half-shouting, \u201cMy cock! Look at my soft cock!\u201d and waving the damp length in floppy circles at Malfoy.\nMalfoy\u2019s lip curls, his cold, totally unimpressed gaze slowly moving up from Harry\u2019s flapping cock, to his bright, excited expression. \u201cYou really are a fucking freak,\u201d he hisses poisonously, \u201cand a total fucking arsehole.\u201d Malfoy kicks himself angrily out of Harry\u2019s bed, picking up his discarded shirt off the floor while shooting Harry another glare that\u2019s pure, venomous fury.\nHarry\u2019s beaming grin fades a little. \u201cMalfoy, no, wait!\u201d He leaps forward, grabbing Malfoy\u2019s arm and drawing him close, giving in to the inexplicable impulse to plant a long, very moist kiss on Malfoy\u2019s snarling mouth.\nMalfoy emits a squeak of surprise, shoving futilely at Harry before suddenly letting his mouth move along with his. When Harry pulls back, he stares at Harry with a mixture of impatient confusion and curiosity.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your deal, Potter?\u201d he demands suspiciously. Then he glances down at Harry\u2019s hand still wrapped around his soft cock, lips twisting into a sneer. \u201cYou have a problem,\u201d he informs Harry.\n\u201cNo, I had a problem,\u201d Harry says earnestly. \u201cI was hexed, see? Praestolor de conpar.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any more sense to me than it did the first time you stuttered it at me.\u201d\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t go down, not until I got sexually involved with my...\u201d Harry trails off, eyes going big and round, before eventually bulging slightly, \u201c...soulmate.\u201d\nMalfoy makes another sound of irritation. \u201cWhat?\u201d he presses exasperatedly, before his eyes narrow dangerously, \u201cWho is your soulmate?\u201d\nHarry sinks down onto the bed, elbows on his knees, his face in his hands as he lets out a long, tortured groan on a weak chuckle. \u201cWhy am I not even surprised? I\u2019m not surprised! Of course it had to be you! This is the fucking parody that my life is!\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long bout of complete silence, and when Harry finally lifts his face out his hands and looks up helplessly, he sees Malfoy standing there, perfectly still, his expression one of controlled panic.\n\u201cWh-what?\u201d he whispers at last, looking very much like he\u2019s fervently praying he\u2019d misheard Harry. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re soulmates,\u201d Harry mumbles glumly. \u201cOr...like...perfectly matched for each other or something.\u201d When Malfoy looks horrified, he hurries to add, \u201cNo! My cock is proof! My soft cock is proof, look at it!\u201d He spreads his thighs out, pointing eagerly to his wonderfully soft cock.\nBut Malfoy doesn\u2019t look. He stumbles back a step, shoving one arm into his shirt sleeve, either not noticing or not caring that the garment is inside out. He throws Harry another frightened look as he backs away. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the effect of some brain injury you suffered, Potter, but I know a lunatic when I see one and I\u2019m not going to wait around to confirm whether I\u2019m right.\u201d\nHarry springs to his feet, reaching for Malfoy with both hands, shaking his head with a croaked laugh. \u201cNo, Malfoy, listen, let me explain--!\u201d\n\u201cBye, Potter!\u201d Malfoy shrieks, turning around and tripping forward blindly.\n\u201cMalfoy, wait!\u201d\n\n Epilogue \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Ron pointedly gags, \u201cListen, you two, I don\u2019t want to spend my birthday watching you both suck face.\u201d Harry shoves his tongue further into Draco\u2019s mouth, his hands discreetly slipping under his shirt. \u201cI swear to Merlin!\u201d Ron bellows. \u201cI\u2019m serious, Harry, I don\u2019t give a flying fuck if he\u2019s the one you were born to fuck or whatever!\u201d\nHarry snorts into the kiss and Draco makes a sound of annoyance, pulling away with a scowl. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he declares, before turning to glare at Ron. \u201cStop saying shit like that, Weasel. We were not born to\u2014 just shut your stupid face.\u201d\n\u201cWe were,\u201d Harry says hotly, thoroughly offended. \u201cHow can you say that after--? We were! We\u2019re soulmates!\u201d\n\u201cI will break up with you,\u201d Draco assures him calmly, elbowing him away and sauntering over to where Ron is sitting sprawled out in the grass, choosing to sit on enormous square of blue and white instead of on the bare ground. \u201cD\u2019you want some cider or not?\u201d he asks when he turns to find Harry still standing there sulkily.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll get himself some cider if he wants some cider, Malfoy,\u201d Ron says rudely as Harry comes and plonks himself down on the blanket beside Draco. When Draco and Harry simply relapse into fervent snogging, Ron screams, \u201c\u2019Mione! Hermione! They\u2019re doing it again! I told you not to invite them! I\u2019m going back home, I swear I am!\u201d\nHermione scoops up Rose from where she\u2019s scampering around a few yards away and heads over, smiling exasperatedly at the sight of Draco crawling into Harry\u2019s lap. \u201cThis is new for them, Ron, let them enjoy it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been nearly a year, are you mental?!\u201d Ron howls, picking up his empty bottle of butterbeer and chucking it wildly at them, the bottle sailing over their heads as Harry suddenly collapses onto his back with a grunt. \u201cI will LEAVE!\u201d\nHarry breaks away with an impatient smack, pushing himself back into a sit as Draco slides off his lap with a very pleased smirk. \u201cWhy are you such an old ballsack, you little shit?\u201d He digs around in the enormous, magically Extended picnic basket and pulls out two bottles of chilled cider. \u201cAs if you and Hermione don\u2019t regularly snog in front of people.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re in public!\u201d Ron shouts, waving an arm around the completely empty stretch of green meadow.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in love!\u201d Harry points out loudly.\n\u201cGross,\u201d Draco mumbles into his cider.\n\u201c\u201dBesides, it wasn\u2019t my idea to have a fucking birthday picnic,\u201d Harry snorts, \u201clike you\u2019re fucking eight.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gorgeous day, Harry, come on,\u201d Hermione sighs, turning her face up into the sun.\n\u201cYeah, it is,\u201d Harry murmurs into Draco\u2019s hair, pulling him closer.\n\u201cYou\u2019re ten seconds away from having cider flung in your face, Potter,\u201d Draco drawls, turning his face slightly to nuzzle Harry\u2019s nose.\n\u201cShut up, you love me,\u201d Harry says on a wide grin.\n\u201cDisputable,\u201d Draco says, taking another sip of cider, but readily accepting the wet kiss Harry plants on his temple. \u201cThis has got to be the dullest birthday celebration I\u2019ve ever been to, Weasley, congratulations.\u201d\n\u201cYou literally weren\u2019t even invited,\u201d Ron points out.\n\u201cHe\u2019s my plus one,\u201d Harry says smugly.\n\u201cThe others won\u2019t be here until noon, nobody managed to get an earlier Portkey,\u201d Hermione says, carefully peeling an orange.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stay past two,\u201d Harry says quickly.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Ron scowls, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u201cWe have plans,\u201d Draco informs him snootily.\nRon snorts. \u201cYeah, we all know what that means,\u201d he glares at Harry, \u201cDoesn\u2019t your cock ever get tired?\u201d\nHarry grins lewdly. \u201cI once spent almost a month with a raging boner, Ron. What do you think?\u201d\n\n~end~\n\n\u00a0"
