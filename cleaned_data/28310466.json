    "text": "When Childe first arrives at Liyue Airport, he does not gawk at the picturesque mountainscapes in the distance, nor does he marvel at the crystalline clear blue sky, free from the gloomy clouds that hung over Snezhnaya all year long.\u00a0\nInstead, he is busy shedding his thick parka whilst scanning the crowd huddled around the  arrivals section of the airport, all waiting and holding up signs with the names of people they are picking up. To be completely honest, he feels wildly out of place with his winter clothes, bright hair, and giant worn suitcase that has Teucer\u2019s action figure stickers plastered all over it in the most disorderly manner possible.\u00a0\nDragging his suitcase behind him\u2014and almost running over the toes of multiple people who fix him with unrestrained glares\u2014Childe fumbles around his pockets for his phone. Once found, he unlocks it, sitting down on a nearby bench and opening up his messaging app. He scrolls through his chats to locate his conversation with 'Guizhong', his apparent new roommate, and taps on her profile picture to get a better look at her face.\nChilde furrows his brows and looks around him. There wasn\u2019t anyone that matched her features from his quick look through the crowd.\n\u201cGod,\u201d he mutters under his breath, sending a quick  i\u2019m here, where are u  into the chat and momentarily regretting the fact that they didn\u2019t organise a specific meeting place because,  wow,  he thinks with another quick turn of his head, this place is  huge. Childe\u2019s afraid that if he moves away any further from where he is, he\u2019ll end up in an entirely different pocket dimension altogether.\nFifteen minutes, two outgoing missed calls, and a scroll through the entirety of his Twitter timeline later (Viktor taking selfies during church, Ekaterina complaining about her recent blind date, the usual), and Guizhong still hasn\u2019t replied, her dainty portrait smiling merrily from next to her previous messages.\u00a0\nChilde groans and locks his phone, throwing his head back to stare at the high ceiling. There\u2019s a baby screeching somewhere to his right, and the sound grates incessantly at his ears.\u00a0\n Maybe Guizhong\u2019s late,  he reasons,  or maybe her phone broke on the way here and\u2014 \nSuddenly, a mess of inky black hair pops into his vision.\nChilde yelps, his surprise causing him to suddenly sit up and bash his head against the stranger\u2019s. \u201cOw!\u201d\n\u201cAh!\u201d The stranger recoils as quickly as he appeared, holding a hand to his forehead. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. It was not my intention to startle you.\u201d\nChilde mirrors his motion, immediately scrambling to plaster a smile across his face because this guy is\u2026 handsome, to say the very least. High cheekbones, golden irises, a messy bun of dark hair, and an alluring touch of rouge eyeliner beneath his eyes.\nOh. Huh. The airport suddenly feels very, very warm.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Childe reassures the stranger hastily, trying to push down the flush rising on his cheeks, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault for reacting the way I did.\u201d\n\u201cI apologise,\u201d the Liyuen man says again with a bow of his head and Childe is now holding his hands up and stuttering as he tries to compute the fact that maybe he\u2019s? Getting hit on? Within thirty minutes of arriving in this country? \u201cNot just for inducing accidental bodily harm, but for being less than punctual as well.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Childe drops his hands. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI am here to pick you up,\u201d the stranger clarifies, his face strangely and comedically solemn for the current situation, \u201cMy name is Zhongli.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean \u2018pick me up\u2019 as in take me on a\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d the other man deadpans, \u201cas part of my obligation as your new roommate.\u201d\nChilde\u2019s brain short-circuits a bit. \u201cHuh? Sorry, but I\u2019m waiting for a \u2018Guizhong\u2019... you must have the wrong person.\u201d\nZhongli frowns, and Childe\u2019s brain instantly snapshots the sight and pastes it directly into his mental dictionary next to the word \u2018cute\u2019. \u201cThen I suppose I am the \u2018Guizhong\u2019 you are looking for, in this case.\u201d\nChilde reaches for his phone. \u201cWait, wait, wait, but Guizhong is a woman,\u201d he says, showing Zhongli the woman in question\u2019s profile picture. \u201cAnd you\u2019re\u2026\u201d a man. A very stunning, \u2018I-would-instantly-empty-my-wallet-for-you\u2019 type of man, but a man nonetheless, \u201c...not exactly that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\nZhongli\u2019s phone rings right at that moment, a strange little tune that Childe swears he has heard before but can\u2019t exactly pinpoint from when. Zhongli reaches into the pocket of his fashionable trench coat, pulls out a Nokia flip phone (what the fuck) and brings it to his ear.\u00a0\n\u201cI found him,\u201d he says without even glancing at the name on the screen. \u201cYes\u2026 no. No. He thinks\u2014 please stop yelling, I do not understand what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nChilde stands there awkwardly, not quite able to comprehend how a man with a Burberry coat and Gucci loafers is still carrying around brick for a telecommunication device in this day and age. Reality is truly stranger than fiction.\n\u201c...Okay.\u201d Zhongli says almost petulantly, before he hands his phone to Childe. \u201cHere. Guizhong would like to talk with you.\u201d\nBy now, Childe has begun piecing together the fact the Zhongli and Guizhong are most probably, definitely, two separate people, and that some strange miscommunication has likely occurred somewhere during the process of him just wanting to avoid being tragically homeless his new country of residence.\n\u201cHello?\u201d he asks into the phone. \u201cGuizhong, right?\u201d\n \u201cYep!\u201d  Guizhong chirps, her voice a bit fuzzy and staticy through the outdated device.  \u201cSorry about all the confusion! I wanted you to get acquainted with Zhongli without me being there in person, but I guess I forgot to tell you that I\u2019m not actually, well, him, haha!\u201d \n\u201cEr\u2026 haha,\u201d Childe says, not sure how to respond, \u201cit\u2019s alright. Everything\u2019s sorted out now, yeah?\u201d\n \u201cI guess so. Well, cool beans,\u201d  Guizhong laughs,  \u201cI\u2019ll meet you two at Zhongli\u2019s apartment to help you guys set up. See you in an hour!\u201d \n\u201cHuh? Oh, okay, b\u2014,\u201d the call disconnects, \u201c\u2014ye.\u201d\nChilde stares at Zhongli\u2019s Nokia, feeling a little disoriented. Zhongli shoots him a look of tired solidarity.\u00a0\n\u201cFor the record, I have no idea why she insisted on finding my roommate for me. I thought I was capable of doing so myself,\u201d Zhongli explains flatly. \u201cSo you are as much of a surprise to me as I am to you.\u201d\nChilde huffs out a laugh. He can\u2019t say he\u2019s displeased. \u201cA pretty good surprise then.\u201d\nZhongli blinks in confusion, and Childe feels his heart squeeze a little. He scratches his cheek and turns his head away. \u201cUm. Nothing, let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI do not have any mora on me,\u201d Zhongli says quietly when they\u2019re in front of Zhongli\u2019s apartment, trying to pay the taxi driver the fare for the trip.\u00a0\nChilde gawks, his face twisting with bewilderment. \u201cHow did you get to the airport, then?\u201d\n\u201cThe driver let me off the hook in exchange for my phone number,\u201d Zhongli says, as if that wasn\u2019t the sketchiest thing in the world. Childe makes a face.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d he says while reaching for his wallet, \u201cI\u2019ll pay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGuizhong is standing in front of the elevators as they enter the foyer, dressed in a flowing white sundress and sandal heels. Her smile is warm and youthful like the afternoon sunshine. She looks almost ethereal. If Childe were a little more heterosexual, he would definitely be trying to arrange a dinner date by this point.\n\u201cHey!\u201d She waves, and Childe waves back, eased by her easygoing attitude, \u201cwelcome to Zhongli-xiansheng\u2019s humble abode!\u201d\u00a0\nShe gestures around the foyer\u2014which is evidently  not  Zhongli\u2019s abode, but it\u2019s close enough.\u00a0\n\u201cZhongli\u2026 what?\u201d Childe asks, the local Liyuen honorific lost on him. Teyvatian may be the universal language of the world, but every nation still has its nuances. He makes himself a reminder to pick up a book on Liyuen language and customs to brush up on later.\n\u201cPlease do not worry about it,\u201d Zhongli tells him as they huddle into the elevator and he swipes his keycard for the fifth floor, \u201cIt is an honorific of respect towards one\u2019s elder, but when Guizhong uses it, it simply serves as a way of teasing me.\u201d\n\u201cNot my fault you walk and talk like an old man all the time,\u201d Guizhong points out.\nAs Zhongli is unlocking the door to his apartment, a strange sound of scratching comes from behind the door. Before Childe can open his mouth and ask about it, the door opens and Childe is promptly greeted with a face full of brown fur.\n\u201cMorax!\u201d Zhongli exclaims, and Childe would be swooning over how smoothly his voice flows with a bit of emotion in it if he wasn\u2019t already busy sputtering and spitting out bits of fur from his mouth.\u00a0\nZhongli pulls the big furry lump away from his face, dangles it\u2014a  cat\u2014by its nape and looks disapprovingly at it. \u201cThat is  not  how we treat guests.\u201d\nThe cat\u2026 Morax, meows in response, its tail flicking side to side. It is the furriest thing Childe has ever seen in his life, and Childe is someone who has seen Viktor\u2019s unshaved legs.\n\u201cTold you that you needed to train some manners into your fur son,\u201d Guizhong says, helping Childe move his luggage into the apartment. \u201cYou spoil him too much.\u201d\nChilde picks the last bit of hair from his tongue before he turns towards Zhongli in disbelief. He looks at the man, looks at the cat, then looks back at the man. \u201c\u2018Morax\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Zhongli replies, bending down to let the little furry devil trot off into the apartment.\nChilde watches the animal retreat around the corner before he turns back towards Zhongli. \u201cYou adopt what is possibly the fluffiest maine coon in all of Teyvat\u2026 and you decide to name it after a  demon. The ruler of hell.\u201d\nZhongli raises his eyebrows. \u201cI do not see a problem with that.\u201d\nChilde opens his mouth to protest, before he remembers the ferocity that Morax had exhibited in launching itself onto Childe as if his face were nothing more than a shiny new squeaky toy. \u201c...I guess so.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZhongli\u2019s apartment is\u2026 unorthodox, for the lack of a better term. It\u2019s very much an organised chaos more than anything\u2014somehow managing to simultaneously tread the thin line between orderly and disorderly, between uncluttered and utterly disastrous.\u00a0\nEverything is where it\u2019s supposed to be\u2014the television is snug against the wall, the table is placed towards the kitchen peninsula so that one is able to access the rooms in a direct route from the couch area. But everywhere Childe lands his eyes, he can spot at least ten different things in his field of vision\u2014clusters of strange, multicoloured ores on the shelves, multiple ancient Liyuen-style calligraphy artworks hung on the walls, an ornate room divider in the corner that seems to serve no purpose other than to look pretty, frog statues made of jade sitting next to a bamboo pot plant next to a marble vase almost as tall as Childe, the list goes on\u2026\n\u201cWhere do I put my stuff?\u201d Childe asks, still looking around the room and playing a spontaneous game of  Where\u2019s Waldo  with himself, except instead of a stripey little man, he\u2019s searching for something that would actually see practical use in everyday life.\n\u201cOver here,\u201d Zhongli says whilst shrugging off his coat, and, wow, his waist is  tiny, \u201cin your room.\u201d\nChilde follows his new roommate into the bedroom, not exactly sure what to expect. He breathes a shallow sigh of relief when Zhongli flicks the lights on and presents him with a rather neat, albeit bare space.\n\u201cThis room used to belong to Guizhong, but she had to move to the other side of the city for work,\u201d Zhongli explains, \u201cNow it is yours. Please feel free to customise it as you see fit.\u201d\n\u201cYou two used to live together?\u201d Childe asks. \u201cThere\u2019s already enough stuff in this apartment with you alone in it.\u201d\nZhongli chuckles, the sound soft and soothing. \u201cGuizhong had taken up much more space than me. She even converted the balcony into her mini workshop for her industrial design projects. Though I admit.. since she moved out, I may have taken up a habit of buying more than I need\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou started  hoarding,  that\u2019s what you started doing!\u201d Guizhong yells from the kitchen. \u201cMe moving out was  so  shocking that you had to turn to material objects to fill that newly formed Guizhong-shaped hole in your heart!\u201d\nZhongli whips his head around. \u201cIt\u2019s not like tha\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m hurt, Zhongli-xiansheng! \u201d  Guizhong whines with her head in the fridge as she fumbles around for something. \u201cSo now you\u2019re saying I meant nothing to you? Not after I spent five years rooming with you? Not after I wasted my entire childhood trying to bail you out of trouble after you kept beating the snot out of the kids on our street?\u201d\nChilde can\u2019t help but burst out laughing. Zhongli brings his hand up to rub at his temples. \u201cI did not senselessly \u2018beat the snot out\u2019 of them. I only did so to defend you and Havria from their harassment.\u201d\nGuizhong pops her head out from behind the fridge door. \u201cYeah, and  that  was enough to get you cemented as our local thug\u2014a tiny elementary school kid absolutely pummelling a bunch of middle schoolers.\u201d She turns towards Childe and shoots him a wink. \u201cIf you ever run into trouble, you know who to call for backup, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cActually, I\u2019m pretty good in a brawl myself,\u201d Childe inputs, \u201cI\u2019d love to see if I can match hand-to-hand with  xiansheng here.\u201d\nZhongli sighs. \u201cNot you too.\u201d\nChilde walks over to the kitchen, taking in the ingredients Guizhong paid out on the kitchen bench. \u201cWhat\u2019re these for?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a dangerous glint in Guizhong\u2019s eyes. \u201cA trial.\u201d\n\u201cA trial?\u201d\nGuizhong closes the fridge. There are little souvenir magnets and sticky notes all over the door. She puts her hand on her hips and gestures towards the ingredients; tofu, rice, multiple types of proteins, and an assortment of vegetables.\nGuizhong grins. \u201cAs you may or may not know,\u201d Childe does not know, \u201cZhongli here is incapable of cooking.\u201d\n\u201cI won our high school culinary competitions.\u201d Zhongli protests under his breath, but Guizhong catches it anyway.\n\u201cCorrection:\u201d she says, \u201cZhongli here is incapable of cooking  for himself.\u201d \nChilde snorts. \u201cSo that\u2019s why you told me you were specifically looking for someone with \u2018world class cooking skills\u2019 on flatmate dot com?\u201d\nGuizhong claps her hands together. \u201cExactly! I\u2019ve seen how well you cook already from your social media, so just think of this as an induction of sorts. If you make something that can live up to Zhongli\u2019s picky tastes, I\u2019ll discount your rent.\u201d\n\u201cI thought  I  was the landlord here.\u201d Zhongli walks over to them, and Guizhong shushes him with a hand over his mouth. The man crosses his arms, but makes no move to swat Guizhong away.\nChilde is already rolling up his sleeves at this point, a playful smirk dancing across his lips. He is so ready for this. \u201cNo worries. Watch me wow this guy off his feet.\u201d\nZhongli smiles from behind Guizhong\u2019s hand, his eyes shimmering under the warm kitchen lights. \u201cSurprise me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMmh! This is  amazing!\u201d Guizhong exclaims between mouthfuls of stir fry\u2014one of the few Liyuen dishes that Childe knows how to cook\u2014before piling more food into her bowl. \u201cIt\u2019s even better than the stuff made by locals.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, that\u2019s some pretty high praise.\u201d Childe grins, stabbing his plastic fork into a piece of chicken.\u00a0\n(Unfortunately, the trio realised too late that Childe is physically incapable of using chopsticks until dinner was almost served, which prompted Zhongli into making a dash for the nearby 7-Eleven to buy a twenty pack of plastic forks, which would hopefully last them until either Childe learns how to wield the fiddly eating utensils, or they go out to buy more environmentally friendly metal forks.)\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the verdict?\u201d Guizhong turns towards Zhongli, who is chewing slowly on a piece of  xianggu and nodding approvingly.\n\u201cGood,\u201d he says. Childe beams.\nGuizhong claps her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s settled, then! Welcome to the team!\u201d\n\u201cWhat team?\u201d Childe asks.\nZhongli looks awkwardly away from the table. Guizhong leans forward. \u201cThe \u2018Helping Zhongli Be A Functional Member Of Society\u2019 team\u2019, of course!\u201d\nMorax takes that opportunity from the lapse in the conversation to lift his head from the cat bowl and meow in agreement.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChilde is in the kitchen at ass-o\u2019-clock later that night, heating up leftovers in the microwave when he feels a presence behind him, and a warm breath ghosting across his nape.\u00a0\n\u201cMunchies?\u201d\nChilde almost springs out of his skin. \u201cSon of a\u2014 fuck!\u201d \nZhongli jumps back, his eyes widening. \u201cI apologise\u2014I didn\u2019t intend to frighten you.\u201d\nChilde drops his combat stance. The microwave beeps. \u201cSorry, my fault. I overreacted.\u201d\nHe takes the food out of the microwave, wincing a little when his fingers make contact with the hot pyrex container. Zhongli follows behind him to the dinner table with a question in his eyes. His hair is tied into a low, side ponytail and his face is softer from a lack of makeup. He has cat slippers on his feet.\u00a0\nAn entirely different sight from when Childe first saw him\u2014tall, stoic, almost regal.\n\u201cJet lag.\u201d Childe answers Zhongli\u2019s unasked query tiredly.\u00a0\n\u201cI see.\u201d\nHe deflects the question back. \u201cWhy are  you still up?\u201d\nZhongli blinks slowly, looking not fully awake. \u201cI\u2026 often wake at random hours of the night.\u201d He replies. Childe frowns.\n\u201cThat can\u2019t be normal.\u201d\n\u201cIt has been the norm for me for years,\u201d Zhongli says with a slight smile. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\nHe takes a seat at the table opposite to Childe, seemingly watching his roommate eat, but Childe can already tell that he\u2019s simply zoning out. They (read: Childe) eat in silence for a while as the clock\u2019s hour hand slowly inches towards two in the morning. It\u2019s a bit awkward in all honesty, mostly attributed to the fact that Zhongli has gone as still as a rock, and Childe doesn\u2019t have much material to create a meaningful conversation from, given that he\u2019s only really known the other man for half a day.\nMorax slinks out from behind Zhongli\u2019s bedroom door, evidently woken up by Childe\u2019s cussing and the aroma of food. He meows and hops onto Zhongli\u2019s lap with the grace of a dolphin despite his bulky stature, and that seems to startle his owner out of his half-asleep state.\n\u201cOh.\u201d He blinks. \u201cHungry?\u201d\nMorax rubs his head against Zhongli\u2019s chest. Childe wishes he had his phone with him to take a picture.\nAfter giving Morax his midnight snack and letting Childe finish his, the three of them sprawl out on the couch, letting the soft light of the television wash over them as Childe flicks through the channels and Zhongli cards his hands through his cat\u2019s fur.\u00a0\nThey fall asleep just like that\u2014National Geographic: Liyue Edition running on the screen and Morax\u2019s cat snores drowning out those of his humans, as morning light bleeds from the tips of the mountains and into the night.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOver the next few days, Childe discovers a lot of things about his new roommate.\nThe first thing is that Zhongli is  terrible  at housework. The severity of this incompetence is further amplified by Morax\u2019s unhelpful tendency to shed hair everywhere and barf up hairballs in the most  obscure places. One of them being, somehow, behind the fridge.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not that Zhongli avoids his chores\u2014in fact, he\u2019s eager to help Childe in any way he can\u2014but more so the fact that he simply does everything wrong: he folds the laundry, but the method is completely inefficient. He vacuums, but for some reason all the dirt on the floor flees to the sides of the nozzle rather than into it. He has no idea how to use the washing machine, or the dishwasher (currently being used as a second pantry), or a hairdryer.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(\u201cHow do you not know how to use one of  these?\u201d Childe almost yells, waving the cordless hairdryer around with his hands and in general making himself a blatant safety hazard within the confines of their shared bathroom.\n\u201cThe last time I tried to use it\u2026 was not a pleasant experience.\u201d Zhongli says stiffly. Childe takes Zhongli\u2019s hand and resolutely places the gadget onto it.\n\u201cShow me how you used it.\u201d\u00a0\nZhongli nods. He brings the dryer up and points the end of it like a gun so that it touches Childe\u2019s forehead\u2014and before Childe can realise that something is fundamentally wrong with this setup, Zhongli flicks the switch for full blast and sends Childe\u2019s head flying back into the mirror, completely K.O.ed.\nNeedless to say, Childe considers himself lucky that his front bangs haven\u2019t been fried to a gingery crisp.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe second thing Childe finds out is that Zhongli is currently doing his masters at the same university that Childe got his transfer scholarship at\u2026 which really shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise given that they live ten minutes from said university, because why else would Zhongli be living here?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(\u201cWe could get lunch together between classes,\u201d Childe grins, perhaps a little too enthusiastically. Zhongli doesn\u2019t seem bothered by it, judging from the smaller but no less happy smile on his face.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he agrees, leaning his chin on his hand, \u201cWe can.\u201d)\n\u00a0\nThen Zhongli casually drops the fact that he\u2019s actually the head of the student council, and Childe subsequently waves their lunch dates goodbye in the face of countless board meetings and leadership obligations.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(The last thing Childe finds out is that Zhongli, despite his technological incompetence and unrealistically picky tastes, is seemingly  perfect  in every other way.\nIt\u2019s not that Childe intentionally stares at his flatmate whenever Zhongli goes off on a tangent about the industrial compounds of their toilet cleaner or fusses over the mud on Morax\u2019s paws or sips his daily cup of green tea with the zen of a thousand monks\u2014his eyes just. Linger.\nBut, well, Zhongli is objectively very attractive, and Childe is objectively very not straight, so of course it\u2019s natural to feel some decidedly very un-roommate-y feelings in this situation, right?)\n\u00a0\n(\u2026Right?)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cChilde,\u201d Zhongli taps him on the shoulder, \u201cI think we need to go shopping soon.\u201d\nChilde looks up from where he\u2019s texting Tonia about sending her some of Liyue\u2019s local beauty products. \u201cSure. You need me to come along, right?\u201d\nZhongli smiles in affirmation, and Childe\u2019s heart flips like a pancake in a teflon pan. \u201cIt would be preferable. And I\u2019d like to use it as an opportunity to show you around the city, given that you have only recently arrived.\u201d\nChilde sits up, leaving Tonia on read. He\u2019ll get back to her later. \u201cWhen?\u201d\nZhongli looks up at the clock, before he turns back around. \u201cHow about in fifteen minutes?\u201d\nChilde makes a face as he pulls himself up from the couch. \u201cI think we need to work on your definition of \u2018soon\u2019.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey meet a kindly elderly woman in the foyer on their way out, donning gardening gloves, a giant hat, and about three layers of sunscreen on her face.\n\u201cChilde,\u201d Zhongli begins, picking Morax up from the floor so the little bugger won\u2019t run around and tangle his legs together with his cat leash  (because Morax needs walks, otherwise he will become fat,  is what Zhongli had said, and Childe, out of the kindness of his heart, decided not to tell him that Morax  already  looks fat with all that fur), \u201cThis is Granny Ping, our resident gardener.\u201d\nHe turns towards Granny Ping. \u201cGranny, this is Childe, our resident\u2026 just resident.\u201d\nChilde laughs at that, taking the elderly woman\u2019s hand and giving her a warm handshake. \u201cNice to meet you, I\u2019m Zhongli\u2019s new roommate.\u201d\nGranny Ping laughs with him, the lines of her face belying the youthful sparkle in her eyes. \u201cWhat a capable young man. You are in good hands, Zhongli.\u201d\nDespite feeling like  he  should be the one in  Zhongli\u2019s hands\u2014being in a new country and all\u2014Childe raises his eyebrows and asks cheekily, \u201chow can you tell I\u2019m capable?\u201d\nGranny Ping takes his hand into both of her hands and runs her fingers over his knuckles. \u201cFor one, you are living with dear Zhongli here.\u201d\nZhongli coughs.\nThe old woman continues. \u201cAnd two, the callouses on these hands tell no lies\u2014you are an able, hardworking young man.\u201d\nChilde stares down at his hand, his grin waning a little. There are multiple laceration scars crisscrossing up and down his fingers, the result of picking up cooking knives too young and too clumsily. The pads of his fingers are rough from the way he holds the brooms, and there\u2019s a faint burn mark dappled across the meat of his thumb from an ironing mishap a few years back.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve always disliked my hands,\u201d he says, perhaps unnecessarily.\u00a0\nGranny Ping looks him in the eyes and smiles back. \u201cOne day you will feel proud of them.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Zhongli says at the checkout whilst peering into his very evidently empty wallet. \u201cI forgot to bring mora.\u201d\nChilde brings his hands up to his head. \u201cFirst the taxi, then the takeout yesterday, and now this.\u201d He mutters. Thank the heavens they\u2019re at a self-service checkout. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to see a concerning pattern here.\u201d\nZhongli simply looks at him with his unmoving gaze, slim fingers still holding the wallet open, and Childe groans as he reaches into his own pocket to pull out his own wallet and fish his own card out of it. \u201cFine.\u201d\u00a0\nAfter that, they make their way outside\u2026 and find Morax engaged in a battle royale showdown with a doberman twice his size, still leashed to a pole. Zhongli promptly drops his three bags of groceries to snatch his hairy son off the ground. Morax hisses and yowls, his claws unsheathed and swiping through the air and very narrowly missing Zhongli\u2019s bare arms.\nThe doberman snarls, restrained by its own leash to a separate pole. Zhongli quickly tries to untie Morax\u2019s knotted leash before a female voice rings through the air, sharp like lightning.\u00a0\n\n \u201cDown!\u201d \n\nThe dog instantly cowers, and Childe looks up to see a short woman with purple dyed hair stalking angrily in their direction.\n\u201cDid Beidou not train  any  manners into you?\u201d She mutters as she frees the whimpering animal from the pole. Then she looks up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014oh.\u201d\nZhongli looks back at her, half his face obscured by angry brown fluff.\u00a0\n\u201cHello, Keqing,\u201d he says, muffled.\n\u201cZhongli,\u201d Keqing stands up. \u201cFancy meeting you here, I haven\u2019t seen you at all during the break. You look well.\u201d\nZhongli smiles, his eyes thinning. \u201cLikewise.\u201d\nKeqing looks away and coughs, tugging her dog\u2019s leash and sliding a strand of hair behind her ears. \u201cI\u2019ll see you once classes start again. Remember to email Ningguang your timetable so that we can organise a slot for our weekly meetings.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Zhongli replies, walking back over to lift all three of his grocery bags with one arm before giving Keqing an awkward half-wave-not-wave. It\u2019s tough to make big hand gestures when he\u2019s got a cat draped over his upper arm. \u201cTake care.\u201d\n\u201cYou too,\u201d she says. Childe can\u2019t help but think that this entire exchange feels very stiff.\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d Childe asks once they\u2019re out of earshot, but not out of sight\u2014the woman\u2019s gaze burns the back of his neck, following his and Zhongli\u2019s every movement.\n\u201cA vice of the student council,\u201d Zhongli hums, trailing his eyes over the window displays as they walk by, \u201cWe\u2019re not particularly close, but she and I are on good terms, at the very least.\u201d\nChilde looks behind him. Keqing is still staring at them. He looks forward. \u201cEr, yeah. I guess\u2014huh? W-woah! Hey!\u201d\u00a0\nSomeone pushes between them with such force that Childe almost topples over and drops his bags.\nThe stranger grunts when Childe shouts at him, before the latter looks over to Zhongli to make sure he\u2019s alright. The older man looks back at him, slightly ruffled but fine for the most part, except for the heavy frown between his eyebrows.\n\u201dAre you okay?\u201d he asks.\nZhongli shifts Morax from one arm to the other, presumably to ease the strain. He pauses. He pats his pocket.\n\u201cChilde,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cJust now, that man, he seems to have\u2026 taken my wallet\u2014\u201d\nChilde sputters. \u201cHe  what?!\u201d\u00a0 \n\u201cHe reached into my pocket and took my\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh my god! Fuck, okay,\u201d Childe lets out a few more choice Snezhnayan expletives, immediately dropping his bags to the ground. \u201cWait here, I\u2019ll get it back right now\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMake way!  Make way\u2014!!!\u201d\u201d \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Childe barely gets a word out of his mouth before a flash of purple hair shoves him to the side for the second time within five minutes. \u201cHey! What the  hell  is going on!\u201d\n\u201cKeqing?!\u201d Zhongli exclaims, staring towards where the woman is running with her dog in the direction the thief had fled in.\nChilde gawks for two seconds before he shakes his head and breaks into a sprint as well, leaving Zhongli, Morax and about five different grocery bags scattered in his wake.\u00a0\nHe trails after the rapid click-clack of Keqing\u2019s heels weaving nimbly through crowds, across roads, and then finally into a fishy back alleyway. In front of him, Keqing seems to have slowed her relentless pursuit while her doberman barks irately, its tail swaying low and cautiously.\u00a0\n\u201cKeqing!\u201d Childe calls out, letting out a surprised \u2018woah\u2019 when the woman snaps her head backwards. \u201cSorry uh, that\u2019s your name right\u2026?\u201d\nKeqing shoots him a sharp look and holds a finger up to her lips.  He\u2019s around here, she mouths, motioning around the dim alleyway and Childe nods in understanding. Both of them strain to listen for any noises out of the ordinary, but for a few minutes there is only the whistling of wind and the hum of cars out in the street.\u00a0\nChilde slowly adjusts his posture.  You sure he didn\u2019t run away already? He gestures towards the exit.\u00a0\nKeqing points towards the darkness, holds up one finger, and shakes her head.  Dead end. I know this city\u2019s layout like the back of my hand.\u00a0 \nGiven how big the city is, Childe has some doubts, but he knows better than to doubt her after seeing how fierce she can be.\u00a0\nA rustle. A tap.\u00a0\nSuddenly, Keqing\u2019s doberman lets out a sharp bark.\u00a0\nSomething glints from the corner of Childe\u2019s vision and instantly he turns on his heels\u2014catching  warm skin gaunt hands,\u00a0narrowly dodging the cold light of a pocket knife stopped inches away from his face.\u00a0\nThe scrawny thief lets out a noise of surprise before his forearm is twisted, toppling his centre of gravity as Childe sends a bruising undercut right into his torso.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHurgh\u2014!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking that, thank you very much.\u201d Childe wrenches away the knife and tosses it to the side. He slides to the side, nimbly dodges another weak punch, counters it with a blow of his own\u2014across the cheekbone, enough to bruise but not enough to seriously injure. \u201cHey! Don\u2019t you know it\u2019s wrong to steal?\u201d\n\u201cFuck off! None of your business\u2014ow!\u201d In one swift movement, Childe sweeps his leg low and buckles his opponent\u2019s legs, causing them both to fall to the cold concrete ground.\u00a0\nFinally, with a rough twist of his hand, he wrenches the wallet away from the thief\u2019s grip.\n\u201cSorry to disappoint you, buddy, but\u2014\u201d he casually flips it open, \u201cyou won\u2019t find any cash in here, unfortunately.\u201d\nThe thief looks up, stunned. Childe almost laughs despite the utterly sad state of Zhongli\u2019s financial inventory, even if the wallet itself is clearly manufactured from high quality foreign leather.\u00a0\nAfter Keqing calls the police and they both explain the situation to the officers, Childe watches as the police car shrinks in the distance. He turns around, and says, \u201cthat was\u2026 unexpected. I think I should get going now, you know, since Zhongli is probably still waiting somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you should,\u201d Keqing says, before adding quickly, \u201cthank you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Oh. No biggie,\u201d Childe grins. \u201cI\u2019ve caught more than one petty thief in Snezhnaya before. And since Zhongli  really  seemed to like this,\u201d he shows her the wallet, \u201cI couldn\u2019t just let him run away with it.\u201d\nKeqing gives him one last solemn nod before she leaves. Childe still can\u2019t read her through that serious aura, but something tells Childe that he may have just won her approval. For what, he still doesn\u2019t exactly know yet.\nWhen he manages to find his way back to Zhongli, he\u2019s surprised to see the older man surrounded by what seems to be a  legion  of young children, all crowded around him and running their hands through Morax\u2019s long fur\u2014much to the grumpy feline\u2019s resigned annoyance.\nZhongli\u2019s eyes light up like jewels as soon as he spots his companion, but then a girl  yanks  on Morax\u2019s tail, and Childe bursts into laughter as he watches chaos unfold before his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOne day before classes start, Childe declares, \u201cWe\u2019re getting you a new phone.\u201d\nZhongli is making his way through some kind of report when Childe slams a hand down onto his desk. He looks up, eyebrows slightly furrowed behind his reading glasses. \u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cWe are. Getting you. A new phone.\u201d Childe enunciates. \u201cOr probably more accurately,  I am getting you a new phone.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYour current phone,\u201d Childe points at Zhongli\u2019s Nokia sitting innocuously at the end of the desk, \u201cis a prehistoric fossil.\u201d\n\u201cBut it is still adequately serviceable.\u201d\nChilde breathes in. He breathes out.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he says childishly, providing no more of a compelling argument beyond that. \u201cWe\u2019re buying you a phone.\u201d\n\u2026Because there\u2019s no way he\u2019s telling Zhongli that he tried calling the latter to tell him about his glorious wallet-winning victory in the alley the other day only for the calls to go straight to an outdated voicemail preset. Fifteen times.\nZhongli stares at him for a few seconds, before he puts his pen down and nods. \u201cAlright, if that makes you happy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhich is why Zhongli walks out of the nearest Apple store with a shiny new phone in his hands three hours later, looking utterly despaired at the lack of number pads on contemporary technology.\nChilde reassures that it\u2019s okay when the older man then insists on paying him back in the future; he\u2019s used to treating the people around him with expensive or outlandish gifts (case in point: Teucer\u2019s 1:1 scale figure of Mr Cyclops sitting in the backyard of their home, almost as tall as their entire house), and given that it\u2019s  Zhongli of all people, Childe is (far too) willing to crack open his bank account here and there for him. And plus, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s strapped for money. His parents are big shots in the Snezhnayan finance market after all.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, hold on,\u201d Childe tugs at Zhongli\u2019s coat on their way back home, \u201cI know that person.\u201d He points towards a short man with a choppy haircut and a hat that\u2019s way too big to be practical whatsoever. \u201cWe graduated together.\u201d\n\u201cWere you friends?\u201d Zhongli asks, but from the flat tone of his voice Childe already knows that Zhongli knows the answer.\u00a0\nHe humours the question anyways. \u201cNope.\u201d\nZhongli exhales through his nose. \u201cGo greet him. It is but a common courtesy. I will take a look around the shops here in the meantime.\u201d\nChilde shoots him a toothy grin before he strides off, stuffing his hands in his pockets as he weaves between other pedestrians to get closer. The shorter figure, however, notices him before Childe gets a chance to scare him. His eyes narrow menacingly, but the taller man simply scoffs and bends down at the knees, fully aware of how insulting the action for the vertically challenged.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here, scared moose?\u201d\n\u201cMy name is  Scaramouche,  you godless heathen,\u201d the other hisses back and stomps on the ginger\u2019s foot. \u201cWhy the fuck are  you here?\u201d\nChilde bites back a yowl of pain. \u201cI transferred to the local uni here, that\u2019s what\u2014\u201d the tiny purple gremlin twists his foot, \u201cOw ow ow  son of a  bitch!\u201d \nScaramouche finally takes his foot off Childe\u2019s and shoots him a thunderous glare. \u201cLiyue National University?\u201d\nChilde gingerly flexes his toes inside his shoes. \u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Scaramouche cusses. \u201cMe too. Now I have to see your ugly face on campus.\u201d\n\u201cMy face is beautiful,\u201d Childe shoots back. A quick glance back tells him that Zhongli is currently being ushered into a high end luxury trinket shop by a very enthusiastic sales rep, and Childe freezes on the spot. Scaramouche\u2019s insults go in one ear, and out the other.\n\u201cOi! Listen to me when I\u2019m talking to you!\u201d\n\u201cSorry moose, duty calls,\u201d he yells, revving into a jog towards Zhongli\u2019s direction, deaf to the other\u2019s protests. \u201cSee you around!\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nUpon entering the shop, he\u2019s quickly faced with the sight of Zhongli holding a\u2026\u00a0\nA statue. Or, to be more precise, a golden Hamtaro statue. \n\u201cChilde,\u201d he says with the barest hint of a whine to his voice, amber eyes wide, \u201cI want this.\u201d\n\u201cThe fuck?\u201d he blurts eloquently, wincing at the way that the statue flashes under the lights like an ungodly disco ball. \u201cWe are  not getting that.\u201d\n\u201cThis is twenty-four karat gold...\u201d\n\u201cOkay listen to me, Zhongli\u2014\u201d\nEvery single protest dies in his throat when Zhongli shoves the statue in his direction, looks down at his feet and says softly, \u201c...and it reminded me of you.\u201d\n\u201c...\u201d\nThe salesperson looks nervously between them. Childe is about to have a mental breakdown.\nA twenty-four karat golden Hamtaro statue.\u00a0\nZhongli thinks Childe looks like fucking  Hamtaro. \nAjax \u2018Childe\u2019 Tartaglia, who has only ever cried once in his life upon birth, almost bursts into tears. He pays for it anyways.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nToe Knee Ah, Ajax Spray-n-Wipe\n\n\u00a0\n\n5:55pm\n\n\n tonia \n\n\n \u00a0should i dye my hair? \n\n\n how do you feel about green \n\n\n like maybe the hatsune miku kinda green \n\n\u00a0\n\n5:57pm\n\n\n huh??? \n\n\n what happened to your carrot pride? \n\n\n and hatsune miku is BLUE \n\n\n shame on you &gt;:( \n\n\u00a0\n\n5:57pm\n\n\n no shame on YOU for forcing me to send you like a million silk flower face masks which i know youre never gonna use \n\n\n Im kidding ily &lt;3 \n\n\u00a0\n\n5:58pm\n\n\n i love you too brother &lt;3 \n\n\n but i wont love you anymore if you actually dye your hair green. \n\n\n also teucer hates green \n\n\u00a0\n\n5:58pm\n\n\n ouch \n\n\u00a0\n\n5:59pm\n\n\n whats the occasion? dont tell me you wanted to dye your hair because you felt like it \n\n\u00a0\n\n5:59pm\n\n\n i just felt a bit insecure \n\n\n hey honest question do you think i look like a hamster \n\n\u00a0\n\nToe Knee Ah is typing...\n\n\nToe Knee Ah is typing...\n\nToe Knee Ah is still fucking typing...\n yeah is what Tonia ends up sending him, and Childe throws his phone to the other side of the room. He glares at the Hamtaro statue of doom sitting proudly on his bookshelf, and snatches it off the shelf.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s  so goddamn ugly.\nChilde briefly considers shot-putting it straight out of the window\u2014five hundred thousand mora be  damned\u2014before Zhongli\u2019s pouty face pops into mind, and he drops his hand in defeat. He collapses back onto his chair, still holding the statue in his hands. Not even a whole month into this whole flatmates business and he\u2019s already developed an... infatuation.\nIs that it?\nNot a crush. Definitely not a crush. Is it? Perhaps he\u2019s just confusing himself at this point. Because, despite everything, Childe hasn\u2019t really  actually  thought about doing anything like  that  with his roommate, because  yes,  Zhongli has a nice ass,  yes, he has nice thighs, but\u2014\u00a0\n...But.\nOkay. Nevermind, he shouldn\u2019t have let his mind wander there, because  now  he\u2019s thinking about it\u2014pressing Zhongli into the bed, or getting pressed into the bed by him\u2014and, oh, wow,  fantastic, is this a fucking boner he\u2019s springing? Shit.\u00a0\nWhile Childe is undergoing a small quarter-life crisis, unbeknownst to him, the door creaks open, and Zhongli strides in with his new phone and the user\u2019s manual in his hand. \u201cChilde, do you have time to... ah.\u201d\nHis gaze falls onto the golden Hamtaro, then to Childe\u2019s crotch, then he coughs once, twice, before gingerly closing the door.\u00a0\nChilde jumps up and pries back open the door indignantly, screeching. \u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe first friend Childe makes at his new university (Scaramouche does not count) is thanks to him forgetting a pen like a dumbass, and having to borrow one from the girl sitting next to him. She introduces herself as Mona Megistus, Astrologist Extraordinaire.\n\u201cSo. You have feelings for your roomie.\u201d Mona recaps, because, well, Childe had to let out his romantic-turned-existential crisis to someone within complaining vicinity, otherwise he would probably explode like one of those hydrothermal vents they had just learnt about today had he held it in for any longer.\nThe entire day, he\u2019s been thinking non-stop about Zhongli; his voice, his eyes, his waist, his fucking  illegal ass\u2014two months of suppressed horny thoughts rushing out end in sight because he\u2019s been so busy tying up loose ends and saying his goodbyes to all his acquaintences in Snezhnaya that up until now, he hasn\u2019t even gotten a quiet moment to let all his steam out.\n\u201cI\u2019m fucked,\u201d Childe admonishes towards himself. Mona rolls her eyes as she sips on her Chatime lychee tea (bought for her by Childe, because Childe seems to be a magnet for people in financial desperation, for whatever reason). \u201cI\u2019m actually fucked.\u201d\nMona scoffs. \u201cStop acting like a big baby. Who knows, maybe it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know, a temporary thing. Passing attraction.\u201d\nChilde groans. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n\u201cI,\u201d he pauses, staring at his hands, \u201cwanna hold his hand. Watch the sunset with him. Maybe grow old and retire together?\u201d\nMona stares at him, unimpressed. \u201cI guess you\u2019re fucked.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d He leans his head into his palms.\nSilence.\n\u201c\u2026When\u2019s your birthday?\u201d The self-proclaimed astrologist pitches her now-empty drink cup at the nearest bin. It misses, but neither of them make a move to pick it up. Childe lifts his head barely enough to rest his chin on his fingers.\u00a0\n\u201cJuly twentieth,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cYou gonna use it to read my horoscope, or something?\u201d\n\u201cMore or less,\u201d Mona replies as stands up, whipping out a strange disk object from her bag.\nChilde watches with wide eyes as Mona proceeds to conduct a ritual known as an 'astrology chart reading', her hands nimble and practiced as she turns the disk, everything coming out of her mouth flying directly over the orange antennae on his head; something something ascendents, something something houses, something something rising moon and planetary motions\u2026\n\u201cSo in summary,\u201d Mona clarifies, \u201cyou\u2019re getting that ass.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting that ass.\u201d Childe repeats numbly, astral projecting a little bit.\u00a0\nMona whips away her astrology device thing just as quickly as she brought it out. \u201cAnd as your new best friend and close confidant, I am now legally obligated to help you two get together.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve only known him for a month,\u201d Childe protests, \u201cwhat if it really  is just a\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d Mona wags a finger at her friend, a mischievous gleam twinkling in her eyes, \u201cThe stars\u2019 decree is absolute, and they have already set the wheels of your budding romance into action!\u201d\nChilde feels his eyebags manifesting. \u201c\u2018Budding romance\u2019 my foot. That guy thinks giving out his number is an acceptable way to pay for a taxi ride. No way is he gonna understand the concept of romance. Romance is dead.\u201d\n\u201cSo he\u2019s one of those types, huh?\u201d Mona nods wisely. \u201cVery well, I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d\n\u201c...No, you don\u2019t really need to get yourself involved.\u201d\nShe snaps her fingers. \u201cAnd  that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, Childe Tortilla\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s pronounced  Tartaglia\u2014\u201d \n\u201c\u2014for I was already involved from the very moment you plucked that dying gel pen straight out of my hands! It\u2019s  destined  that I enter your life as your guide to all things romance,\u201d she smirks. \u201cAnd think of this as an equivalent exchange; you buy me milk teas, I get you a boyfriend. Fair, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQueen MonAss  \u2764, Ajax Spray-n-Wipe\n\u00a0\n\n3:13pm\n\n\n First things first \n\n\n If there is ANY sort of development between you two i will be the FIRST to know. \n\n\n Capeesh? \n\n\u00a0\n\n3:14pm\n\n\n ok \n\n\u00a0\n\n3:14pm\n\n\n Okay good \n\n\n Youre supposed to respond back with capeesh \n\n\n Nevermind.

Zhongli?\u201d\nSaid man pops his head out from his room, his glasses perched on his head, long hair in a bun and a flustered expression on his face\u2014or as flustered as a man with the emotional spectrum of a cactus can be. \u201cChilde. Just in time. Would you mind helping me look for my\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOn your head.\u201d\nZhongli brings a hand up to pat his glasses resting atop his hair. \u201cAh. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cNo worries,\u201d he pulls his lips upwards, but there\u2019s a strange feeling of nervousness stirring inside his gut, \u201cactually, can you come here for a moment? I bought something for you.\u201d\nZhongli raises an eyebrow, walking over to the doorway where Childe has placed the box on the ground before grabbing a pair of scissors from the kitchen to cut open the wrapping. \u201cI do not see how there have been any recent occasions that warrant a gift, Childe.\u201d\n\u201cOh no, I just,\u201d Childe fumbles, slicing through the layers of gift wrapping (why are stores still using Santa patterned gift wraps?), \u201cjust felt like getting you something.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Zhongli\u2019s mouth opens in mild surprise, gutwrenchingly cute. \u201cThat\u2019s very sweet of you to do so.\u201d\nChilde coughs harshly, feeling his heart dancing at 2.25x speed in his chest before he rips open the cardboard packaging with much, much more force than necessary. Zhongli waits until the other man\u2019s done, before he peers into the box and carefully lifts out its contents, gingerly holding it in his hands.\n\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d he trails off in wonder.\nChilde feels his face grow warm as he laughs nervously, scratching at his cheek. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ve only been here for a month but I\u2019m already introducing a new occupant into our tiny place\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI love it.\u201d Zhongli declares calmly. Childe gawks. \u201cWe should bestow it with a name.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTwo hours and a countless number of rejected names later, \u2018Roomba\u2019 is appropriately named and welcomed as the first Zhongli-friendly vacuum cleaner to ever grace the household.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n You two sure clicked together, huh?\u201d  Guizhong says, the crinkling of her Dorito bag almost drowning out her words as she pops another chip into her mouth.  \u201cHeard you guys are attached at the hip now.\u201d \nChilde laughs and takes Zhongli\u2019s phone off his hands, holding it at an angle so that half of both his and Zhongli\u2019s faces are caught by the camera. \u201cThat sounds like an exaggeration. We\u2019re just good buds, right, old man?\u201d\nZhongli digs his elbow into Childe\u2019s side, earning him a yelp. \u201cI am not yet getriatric enough to warrant that title.\u201d\n\u201cGee, then can you tell me why we\u2019re calling Guizhong on  Skype? No one uses Skype anymore.\u201d\n \u201cBoys,\u201d  Guizhong cuts in, talking as if she wasn\u2019t the same age as the getriatric old man next to Childe,  \u201cI\u2019m a busy woman, as much as I\u2019d love to join Childe with the teasing, I don\u2019t have time to listen to your old married couple bickering. Now tell me why you called me, Zhongli.\u201d \nZhongli flushes a little, the tips of his ears and nose dusting red, and Childe almost coos at the sight. Almost. \u201cI simply\u2026 missed you. It\u2019s been a while since I saw you.\u201d\nGuizhong cackles through the screen, completely unhelpful.  \u201cYou just miss being my little spoon.\u201d \nZhongli flushes harder at that, and Childe splutters.\u00a0\n \u201cWell?\u201d  Guizhong wriggles her eyebrows,  \u201cI don\u2019t hear any denials there. If you wanted to cuddle so bad, you know you could just ask Childe.\u201d \n\u201cI could not possibly do that,\u201d Zhongli protests a little too quickly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that troubling him with such a request is out of the ques\u2014\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d Childe interjects before he knows what he\u2019s doing, \u201cI\u2019m okay with cuddles.\u201d\nSilence.\nMorax scratches at the door. Zhongli uses this as an excuse to extract himself from the conversation, mumbling about forgetting to walk the cat as he stumbles towards the doorway and almost bangs his shin against their shoe rack.\u00a0\n\u201cRemember to buy eggs!\u201d Childe calls out, but three seconds after the door closes he realises that he may as well have not said anything at all, because Zhongli never carries enough spare change on his body to pay for said eggs anyways.\n \u201cThat\u2019s cute. He got embarrassed.\u201d  Guizhong says between another mouthful of Doritos.  \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time he blushed like that.\u201d \nChilde opens his mouth. Closes it. Opens it again. \u201cGuizhong, can I ask you something?\u201d\n\n \u201cShoot.\u201d \n\n\u201cWere you and Zhongli ever,\u201d he makes a strange jazz-handy motion, \u201ca thing?\u201d\nGuizhong blinks. The video call lags, so her eyes remain closed for two seconds longer than they should have.\n \u201cYeah we dated for a bit in high school,\u201d  she tells him, and Childe holds his breath,  \u201cbut really, it was more of an excuse to get all the girls\u2014and the occasional guy\u2014off Zhongli\u2019s back so he could focus on his studies, you know?\u201d \n\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t anything serious?\u201d Childe asks, his heart thumping in his chest.\nGuizhong shrugs.  \u201cNope\u2026 well, I guess there were  some  feelings in there, but it was just teenage hormones to be honest. We\u2019re past that now. He\u2019s more like a brother to me than anything.\u201d \n\u201cOh,\u201d Childe swallows, \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\nGuizhong raises her eyebrows at that, and the sound of cracking Doritos echoes through the speaker.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(Contrary to both Zhongli and Childe\u2019s expectations and completely in line with Guizhong\u2019s, cuddle nights become a thing.)\nChilde wakes to the feeling of something nudging his shoulder. He groans and flops over onto his back, cracking his eyes open with a soft snort, blinking away the sleep fog.\n\u201c...? Huh?\u201d\n\u201c...Childe,\u201d Zhongli murmurs, standing awkwardly at the bedside, \u201ccan I join you?\u201d\n\u201cWuh? \u2018Kay...\u201d The younger man groans, only a quarter awake, before flopping over and squashing his nose into the pillow and diving straight back into the bliss of sleep.\nZhongli quietly pulls back the covers and settles himself next to the other man, resting his head gently into the junction between nape and shoulder, slowing his breathing to match Childe\u2019s, and drifting off into one of the more restful sleeps he\u2019s had in a long time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the morning, Childe wakes up with a smushed nose and soft breaths against the shell of his ear. It takes half an hour of confused yelling, misunderstandings, and a whole pot of green tea before Childe pulls his mind out of the gutter.\nCan\u2019t blame him, really\u2014snuggling in front of the TV in close proximity is one thing, but waking up next to each other in the morning with entangled legs is a whole other can of worms altogether.\u00a0\n\u201cPlatonic cuddling,\u201d Childe insists, downing another cup of tea in one go.\nZhongli nurses his own tea in his hands, confused as to why Childe sees the need to use such a particular term for it, but goes along with it nonetheless.\n\u201cOkay. \u2018Platonic\u2019,\u201d he says with the most clueless face ever. Childe is going to pirouette off a skyscraper.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQueen MonAss  \u2764 , Ajax Spray-n-Wipe, Keqing., \u2740 Guizhong Ballista \u2740, Guest User #57386, Ningguang (Do not contact me outside of work hours)\n\u00a0\n Queen MonAss    \u2764   has renamed the chat to \u2018Operation Spice Girls\u2019 \n\u00a0\n\nAjax Spray-n-Wipe\n\n\n what is this???\n\n\u00a0\nQueen MonAss \u2764\n\n Ive gathered some people to help with your little problem\u00a0 \n\n\n Since it\u2019s been 3 months\u2026. and nothing has changed at ALL between you and your equally useless roommate\u00a0 \n\n\n Except for these \u2018platonic cuddles\u2019 you told me about \n\n\n But since they\u2019re APPARENTLY \u2018platonic\u2019 they dont count. \n\n\n So i thought getting some outside opinions would help move things along a little, yknow \n\n\n Dont worry, you can thank me later :* \n\n\u00a0\n\nAjax Spray-n-Wipe\n\n\n wait\u00a0 \n\n\n HANG ON \n\n\n NO \n\n\n MONA YOU #%$!\u2019*\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2740 Guizhong Ballista \u2740\n\n\n Don\u2019t worry dear, we\u2019ve got your back!! ;D \n\n\u00a0\n\nAjax Spray-n-Wipe\n\n\n GUIZHONG?!?! \n\n\n YOU\u2019RE IN ON THIS?? \n\n\n mona how did you get guizhong\u2019s contact \n\n\n and why are two members of the student council in here as well??? \n\n\u00a0\nQueen MonAss \u2764\n\n Lets just say\u2026 i have connections. \n\n\u00a0\n\nKeqing.\n\n\n Mona and I are dating. \n\n\u00a0\nQueen MonAss \u2764\n\n KEQING FUCK \n\n\n I WANTED TO LOOK COOL \n\n\n \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94 \n\n\u00a0\n\nNingguang (Do not contact me outside of work hours)\n\n\n Keqing.\u00a0 \n\n\n Did you drag me into this pointless chat just so I could generate clout for you? \n\n\u00a0\n\nKeqing.\n\n\n \u2026 \n\n\u00a0\n\nNingguang (Do not contact me outside of work hours)\n\n\n \u2026 \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2740 Guizhong Ballista \u2740\n\n\n [Image Attachment] \n\n\u00a0\n\nNingguang (Do not contact me outside of work hours)\n\n\n It\u2019s fine.

He yawns, runs a hand through his messy hair, and peels himself out of bed.\nZhongli, as predicted, is already up and fully functional despite running only on mere dregs of sleep most nights. His grey dress shirt, reading glasses, and tied back hair all contribute to a professional air that\u2019s much more suitable for a university professor rather than a student.\n\u201cI had the strangest dream last night.\u201d Childe rubs at his eyes as he walks out of his room with a white shirt in hand, wincing at the bright rays piercing into the apartment.\n\u201cPray tell.\u201d Zhongli says while flicking through the morning newspaper like every other grandpa in the country. Childe grumbles and halfheartedly throws on the shirt, getting his head caught in the wrong hole in the process. The brunette flicks his eyes over onto his roommate\u2019s abdomen before hiding the motion with a sip of tea.\n\u201cIt was like,\u201d Childe scrunches up his face while he tries to glue together fragments of the dream, \u201cSome fantasy world. We were in Liyue. But it wasn\u2019t  Liyue Liyue, you know?\u201d\nZhongli looks up from the paper, gaze hovering. \u201cI\u2026 do not know.\u201d\nChilde ignores him. \u201cSo I was some kind of assassin or agent or whatever from some foreign country, and you were, like. You ran funerals.\u201d\n\u201cI ran funerals.\u201d Zhongli echoes, amusement lining his voice.\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t just run funerals and stuff,\u201d Childe blabbers as he switches on the toaster and muffles a yawn. \u201cYou were actually the god of money. Which is ironic as fuck because the dream-you-but-god was  still  broke like hell and kept using  my money like the bourgeois parasite you are but you know I didn\u2019t really mind because I love you and then I found out that for some reason Granny Ping was like a low level god and something happened and I got super angry so I summoned a giant sea monster and after it got defeated somehow you managed to send the entire world into deep economic recession.\u201d\n\u201cWait.\u201d Zhongli slowly closes the newspaper. \u201cWhat did you say in the middle?\u201d\nChilde looks up as he\u2019s putting the bread into the toaster. \u201cWhat? That Granny Ping was a god?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026 before that.\u201d\nChilde scrunches his face up again, the tendrils of sleep still holding his brain in a chokehold. \u201cDon\u2019t remember. Don\u2019t you have, like, a photographic memory? Why are you asking me?\u201d\n\u201cThe more appropriate term you are looking for is \u2018eidetic memory\u2019,\u201d Zhongli tells him, \u201cAnd you were speaking too fast, I didn\u2019t catch what you said in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t remember and I don\u2019t remember, then it\u2019s clearly not that important,\u201d Childe shrugs and gingerly takes the bread out of the appliance. Zhongli furrows his brows and lets out a little sigh, before he flips to the back of the newspaper to start his daily crossword puzzle.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe first real test of Childe\u2019s dedication to the cause comes in the form of Zhongli, one afternoon, on the floor of the living room, clutching Roomba to his chest and staring back at him with eyes as wide as saucers.\n\u201cChilde,\u201d his voice wobbles, \u201cI think Roomba is ill.\u201d\nChilde stands rigid, one hand on the doorframe, the other between his heel and shoe, and blanks out.\u00a0\nHis first thought:  oh my god, I need to call a vet.\u00a0 \nHis second thought:  do vets accept roombas? \nHis third thought:  wait a fucking minute. \nThe circular machine in Zhongli\u2019s arms sputters, whirs, and dies in a small puff of smoke. Zhongli looks like he\u2019s two seconds away from shutting down in solidarity. Morax looks on smugly from the top of the fridge.\nChilde brings a hand to pinch his nose, ignoring the fact that it had just been in his shoe a second prior. \u201cZhongli.\u201d\n\u201c...Yes?\u201d\n\u201cHave you been feeding it human food\u2026 again?\u201d\nZhongli blinks. \u201cI thought it would be hungry after sweeping the floors. So I fed it fried chicken.\u201d\nChilde snaps his head towards the box of Timmie Fried Chicken sitting on the counter.\u00a0\n\u201cZhongli,\u201d he says, secretly proud of how steady he\u2019s managing to keep his voice. \u201cRoombas \u2018eat\u2019 dust. They\u2019re not supposed to eat TFC.\u201d\nZhongli furrows his brows and hugs the vacuum cleaner closer to his chest. \u201cThe owner\u2019s manual did not specify any dietary guidelines or requirements, so I thought\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSometimes you think wrong,\u201d Childe groans, slumping his shoulders as he moves away from the doorway and slides his feet into a pair of slippers with practiced ease.\nZhongli frowns harder when Childe takes the dead Roomba out of his arms. \u201cBut last time when I fed it sunflower seeds, it seemed perfectly fine.\u201d\nChilde cracks loose the dustbin, winces at the pungent smell of deep fried avians, and sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replies, even though he knows perfectly why.\nZhongli stands up and peers over his shoulder, wrinkling his nose. \u201cWill everything be okay?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. It just needs some\u2026 deep cleaning. I think we gotta go buy some extra strength dish detergent first.\u201d\n\u201cIf I feed it a fried egg\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTeyvat Fried Eggs are  not \u2018good enough to revive the dead\u2019. Zhongli, that cookbook lied to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI will be out tonight.\u201d\nChilde looks up from where he was immersed in his essay on the evolutionary history of sea cucumbers and its associated taxonomic complications. \u201cWhere to?\u201d\n\u201cA party. At a club,\u201d Zhongli replies. Childe takes a moment to register what he just heard.\n\u201cA party?\u201d He rolls his wheely chair to the door of his room and pokes his head out to look at Zhongli. \u201cYou?\u201d\nZhongli looks back at him with a slightly miffed expression. \u201cIs that so out of the ordinary?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201c...Okay. I will admit it is a little out of the ordinary\u2014\u201d\n\u201cZhongli,\u201d Childe says seriously. \u201cYou are a literal social hermit. This is  way out of the ordinary. If it was a formal party, okay, but since you mentioned that it\u2019s at a club, I feel nothing but worry. Do you even know what a shot is?\u201d\n\u201cAnother term for vaccination.\u201d Zhongli immediately replies, and Childe smacks his own forehead.\n\u201cNo! Well, I mean, yeah, but in this context it\u2019s a small glass of alcohol.\u201d Childe ruffles his hair as he stands up. \u201cAnyways, you can\u2019t go out clubbing looking like  that,\u201d he says, pointing at Zhongli\u2019s bespoke suit.\nThe older man looks down at himself, genuinely confused. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t.\u201d Childe replies, already used to Zhongli\u2019s lack of awareness of conventional societal codes after three months of exposure therapy. \u201cCome here, I\u2019ll give you something more appropriate.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTwenty minutes and two changes of clothes later, the intercom rings.\n\u201cThat would be Venti,\u201d says Zhongli as Childe helps him paint on the last stroke of vermillion liquid eyeliner.\n\u201cHold still,\u201d he mumbles, \u201c\u2018Venti\u2019 can wait for two more seconds\u2026 and\u2026 wait, and done.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Childe, I appreciate it,\u201d Zhongli tells him warmly, bringing his hand up to hold the other man\u2019s wrist. They lock eyes for a few seconds, noses almost touching from the proximity. \u201cBut I would have been fine with applying makeup on my own\u2014\u201d\nThe intercom rings again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow,\u201d whistles Venti at the doorway. \u201cContrary to my expectations, you actually don\u2019t look like a grandpa this time.\u201d\nZhongli crosses his arms, the cute frown crease between his eyebrows making another welcome appearance. \u201cI assume I should be taking offense to that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. No offense and all but your taste in fashion is, like, the super middle-aged balding businessman type of fashion. The kind of style you see being worn in an issue of  Teyvat Property Investment Times.\u201d Venti jests, squatting down to poke at the holes in Zhongli\u2019s ripped jeans.\nChilde decides to jump in at that moment to save his roommate from any more humiliation from this little green gremlin. \u201cHey there kid, Venti, right? I\u2019m Zhongli\u2019s roommate.\u201d\u00a0\nHe hears Zhongli breathe a little sigh of relief, and mentally pats himself on the back.\nVenti shakes his hand with the force of a whirlwind. His laugh is bright and airy, like wind through a field in summer. \u201cIf I were a little less nice I would have smacked you for calling me a kid. Perhaps not unlike this gentleman next to you, whose temper he often has to keep under a lid!\u201d\nChilde raises an eyebrow, \u201cZhongli? Angry? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible.\u201d\nVenti shoots him a shit-eating grin. \u201cOh you don\u2019t know? Once, I crashed over at his place drunk and puked over his new rug, then he proceeded to whoop my ass all the way back to\u2014\u201d he says, before getting wacked upside the head by the aforementioned asswhopper of local green drunkards.\nZhongli scowls. \u201cThat is  enough. I still cannot fathom why I associate myself with the likes of you when you have the gall to behave like this towards me.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you love me!\u201d Venti chirps, rubbing his head. \u201cPlus, I\u2019m your only other real friend besides Guizhong and Havria, and I guess also your boyfriend here\u2014\u201d\n \u201cBoyfriend?\u201d Childe splutters, \u201cI\u2019m not his boyfriend!\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Venti squints at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not? But you guys hang around each other on campus so much that everyone thought\u2014\u201d Zhongli smacks him again,  \u201c\u2014ow!\u201d \n\u201cWe are leaving.\u201d\n\u201cHey, hey wait! Gramps, you know my legs aren\u2019t as long as yours\u2014  oi!  Don\u2019t close the elevator doors on me! Zhongli! You buffoon! Zhongliiiiii!!!\u201d \nChilde slowly retreats back into the apartment, locks the door, and sighs.\nA quick glance at the clock tells him that it\u2019s currently five in the afternoon. Oh. He didn\u2019t ask Zhongli when he\u2019d be back.\nWhat if it gets cold in the evening? Zhongli wasn\u2019t wearing that much when he left\u2014hell, what if he gets arthritis in the kneecaps from the ripped jeans? Can you even get arthritis from the cold? What if Zhongli catches a cold? He won\u2019t be able to do his thesis that\u2019s due, like, next week\u2014\n\u201cFuck!\u201d Childe yells, running his hands furiously through his hair. He has got to stop fretting over his  completely  capable,  very  adult, only  occasionally  vacant-brained roommate.\nSaid roommate can recite the entire Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine to the tune of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star from back to front even though he majors in  rocks, and here\u2019s Childe, fussing over him like a big, orange mother hen.\nHis siblings\u2019 cheeky grins flash through his mind. He sighs. Old habits sure do die hard.\n...\nHe turns around.\nThe apartment seems uncomfortably empty now. It\u2019s a foreign feeling to him, who has lived pretty much his entire life around other people in the household, but now\u2014\nSomething scratches at his leg.  \u201cMeow.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u201c...Hi, Morax.\u201d He mumbles as he picks the cat off the floor, unexplainable emotions churning in his gut like a storm. \u201cFor some reason I really wanna punch something right now.\u201d\nMorax replies with a wide-eyed stare.\nChilde sniffs as he walks both of them to the couch, flopping down onto it and holding the animal high into the air like Rafiki holding Simba. \u201cNot you. I wouldn't dare to think about punching you. That\u2019s a surefire way to get Zhongli to throw me into the core of the earth.\u201d\nSea cucumbers be damned, Childe\u2019s definitely not in the mood to finish his essay now. Instead, he turns on the TV and flicks through the channels, stopping on a rerun of an old episode of the Teletubbies because he\u2019s in the mood for self-flagellation. But Morax seems to enjoy it well enough, so he throws the remote somewhere off to the side and resigns himself to being Morax\u2019s sentient fur comb for the next few hours, the afternoon sun pouring its dying rays through the balcony door.\n...Zhongli\u2019s got enough common sense to keep himself safe at a party and not drink or eat anything suspicious or weird, right?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn Childe\u2019s defense, sea cucumbers were a very cumbersome, very soul-draining topic to research. Which is why he\u2019s not exactly surprised to find himself waking up many hours later in the dead of the night, neck bent uncomfortably over the back of the couch.\nWhat he  is  surprised to find out is that there is, apparently, something\u2014  someone shifting around near their kitchen, and Childe immediately recognises the silhouette as too large and hulking to be anywhere near Zhongli\u2019s lithe figure. He quietly lifts Morax off his lap, careful not to wake him up.\nA thief?  Shit,  did he not lock the door? He swears he locked the door. He one hundred percent locked that fucking door. He remembers, because he had an existential crisis  right after doing so. \nChilde cringes every time his bare feet make a sound against the floor as he sneaks towards the light switch. God, why couldn\u2019t he be more like Zhongli and wear his socks to sleep? This is gonna  kill him; the intruder is gonna hear his squeaky feet and turn around and they\u2019re gonna have a gun and shoot him in the face and he\u2019s gonna die of blood loss before he gets the chance to confess his undying love to the prettiest man on earth\u2014\n \u201cAha!\u201d Childe screams when he flicks the lights. The intruder freezes, about three centimetres away from banging their hip on the kitchen island.\nThey turn around. Childe registers a head of bright red hair, about fifteen belts wrapped around various parts of the body, the most intense scowl he\u2019s ever seen, and\u2026 what looks like a dead body draped over his shoulder.\n\u201cYou live with him?\u201d The redhead gruffs, gesturing at his inanimate human-shaped luggage and\u2014oh, thank heavens, it\u2019s just Zhongli, still alive (thankfully), dozed off and drooling all over this tall stranger\u2019s fur trim coat.\n\u201cUh.\u201d Childe\u2019s brain stutters. \u201cYeah.\u201d He gestures at his narwhal-patterned pajama bottoms. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Diluc,\u201d the man introduces himself, his baby face somehow not at all detracting from his acute resting bitch face, \u201cVenti\u2019s friend and designated driver.\u201d\n\u201cOh. I\u2019m Childe. Uh, thanks for getting Zhongli home safely.\u201d Childe says, relieved to hear that this wasn\u2019t just some random citizen that found Zhongli passed out in the middle of the road and felt kind enough to bring him home using the details of Zhongli\u2019s driver\u2019s license, or something.\nChilde glances at the front door, then at the balcony, then back at Diluc. \u201cHow did you get in?\u201d\n\u201cI used to pick locks for a living.\u201d Diluc replies ominously. Childe isn\u2019t sure he wants to get too involved with a guy who looks like he shops at Hot Topic and probably commits felonies for fun, so he doesn\u2019t ask any further. It\u2019s not like he himself didn\u2019t do stupid and arguably illegal things in his teen years, but he\u2019s eager to leave that all behind him now.\n\u201c...Okay.\u201d He coughs. \u201cWell, uh, you can put Zhongli down in his room. The door to your left.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Diluc says, before fading into the darkness. Childe shuffles in after him, groping against the wall before flicking the lights on.\nHe stares. Now that he thinks about it, he\u2019s never actually been in Zhongli\u2019s room, even if Zhongli has invaded Childe\u2019s room countless times simply because the mortal concept of personal privacy is completely lost on the older man. As Diluc deposits Zhongli\u2019s sleeping form onto the bed, Childe takes the opportunity to look around.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a giant bookshelf standing against the side wall with all kinds of dictionaries, encyclopedias, textbooks, and a few sci-fi novels arranged neatly along it\u2019s shelves. The desk is tidy and ergonomic; stationary arranged into metal organisers, and loose sheets of paper filed into desktop drawers. A small dragon paperweight sits in the corner, its eyes carved from amber. The walls are free from posters, save for a giant world map stuck right above the desk. He\u2019s not sure what he was expecting, given that he\u2019s never really thought about it, but the space is definitely a lot neater than he thought it would be.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s very\u2026 Childe doesn\u2019t know how to describe it, other than the fact that it\u2019s very  Zhongli. Very meticulously laid out, very efficient, but also looking more fit for a late-forties office worker than a mid-twenties university student.\u00a0\n\u201cYou know what to do when he wakes up, right?\u201d Diluc asks him in that flat voice of his, raising his hand to list off; \u201ca bucket to puke in, glass of water, painkillers, a cold shower\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay, I get it!\u201d Childe exclaims, since he\u2019s admittedly gotten hung over enough times in high school to know how to treat the same ailment in someone else. \u201cHow much did he even drink?\u201d\nDiluc\u2019s face is absolutely unimpressed. \u201cA lot,\u201d he says, somehow both helpful and unhelpful at the same time. \u201cDefinitely not an amount that a president of the student council should be drinking.\u201d\nChilde winces a bit, rubs his head, and escorts Diluc back out to the living room. \u201cI see. Anyways, thanks again for dropping him off, I owe you one.\u201d\n\u201cNo,  Venti owes me one.\u201d Diluc bristles, before he pauses and stares in the direction of the couch, pointing at a snoring brown lump. \u201cIs that your cat?\u201d\n\u201cMorax? Yeah, he is.\u201d\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Diluc whips his black phone out from his black coat pocket with hands encased in black gloves. This guy sure has an exciting wardrobe. \u201cIs this also your cat?\u201d\nChilde squints at the bright screen. It\u2019s an Instagram account\u2026 a cat account, to be more precise. Featuring a brown cat that looks  extremely  familiar. The username  \u2018moraxgodofwar\u2019 is sprawled across the top of the screen.\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Childe echoes distantly, \u201cis that our cat?\u201d\n\u201cYour cat\u2019s famous. Look, one million followers.\u201d\nChilde\u2019s jaw promptly drops to the ground. He can\u2019t believe that Zhongli made an instagram account for  Morax  before he made one for  himself. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter swapping contacts with Diluc and agreeing to send him occasional cat pics as payment for Zhongli\u2019s ride home, Childe closes the door, triple checking the locks before quietly making his way back into Zhongli\u2019s room.\nZhongli is awake now, but barely. His eyes are glazed over, cheeks are still flushed, and he almost knocks his glasses from the bedside table when he tries to prop himself up.\n\u201cChilde\u2026\u201d Zhongli slurs, and  Childe is the one that almost trips and faceplants onto the floor despite being the more sober of the two.\n\u201cH-hey,\u201d he takes the older man\u2019s hand. It\u2019s warm and pale and smooth and he cuts that train of thought before it can go any further, \u201cI\u2019m here. Are you feeling okay?\u201d\n\u201cMmh\u2026\u201d Zhongli closes his eyes, drunken flush still visible under the dim light pouring in from the kitchen, \u201cCome... closer.\u201d\n\u201cWh\u2014\u201d is all Childe manages to get out before he\u2019s dragged onto the bed, mouth open in shock as Zhongli flips them with an very undrunkern amount of strength so that Childe is lying with his back against the sheets and Zhongli has his head between Childe\u2019s legs\u2014\nHoly shit.\nZhongli\u2019s head is between Childe\u2019s legs. And Childe is going to pass directly the fuck away.\n\u201cI want,\u201d Zhongli mumbles, leaning his head against the inside of the other man\u2019s thigh as he drags Childe\u2019s pants down, \u201cyou.\u201d\nOh, gods.\n\u201cZhongli... hold on, hold on, you\u2019re drunk\u2014\u201d Childe shrieks, half kicking Zhongli when the latter nuzzles his lips against his (unfortunately) rapidly hardening length, breath hot and wet and seeping through Childe\u2019s boxers.\u00a0\nZhongli pauses, looks up at him with wide eyes. His voice is rough, low. \u201c...Do you not want this?\u201d\nChilde stops kicking. He stares back, his brain running on pure adrenaline and his heart battering against his chest. It\u2019s the sexiest thing he\u2019s ever seen.\n\u201cI do.\u201d He says weakly, plastering a smile on his face that probably looks more like a grimace instead. \u201cBut not like\u2014 ah!  Hey, wait a minute\u2014\u201d\nZhongli clumsily tugs Childe\u2019s boxers all the way down, eyes slitted and hungry and misty as he laps at Childe\u2019s dick with unbelievable desperation, soft breaths dripping from his lips and sending electrifying jolts through Childe\u2019s body.\nChilde\u2019s elbows give up from under him as he sinks into the sheets, his dick harder than it\u2019s probably ever been in his life. He lets out a few choice Snezhnayan cusses from under his breath, sees Mona\u2019s smug face flash through his mind, flips off the stars above, and prepares to dive headfirst into the feeling of plush lips, slick saliva, and scorchingly raw gazes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChilde wakes to the smell of cooking.\nHe groans. Rolls over, flattening his face into the blankets. His head is pounding a little, and his mouth feels like it\u2019s cultivating an entirely new species.\u00a0\nNormally, he would be up as soon as he\u2019s awake\u2026 but today, he really, really feels like sleeping in until\u2026\n...\nHang on.\u00a0\nChilde\u2019s eyes snap wide open. He pushes himself up from the bed.\u00a0\nShit.\nZhongli\u2019s bed. He\u2019s still in Zhongli\u2019s bed. His pants are nowhere to be seen, but at least his boxers are back on. Memories of the night prior burst into his head with the intensity of bulldozer on crack.\nHe barely stops himself from punching a hole in the wall when he thinks about how much it would cost to get it fixed.\u00a0\nChilde proceeds to stumble to the door, greeted by the sight of Zhongli in the kitchen, wearing what at this point is basically Childe\u2019s apron, using Childe\u2019s ladle, cooking with Childe\u2019s pot, and just in general taking over Childe\u2019s domain of the house\u2014because Zhongli is the type of person to write an essay for a whole two days and completely forget to eat until he hits the fifty-thousand word mark where he would then proceed to pass out from nutritional deficiency, so of course Childe immediately had to assume ownership of the kitchen so that he can enforce some semblance of order into his roommate\u2019s disastrous lifestyle.\n\u201cUm.\u201d Childe says eloquently. \u201cMorning.\u201d\nThe brunette turns around, his face clean from yesterday\u2019s makeup and his hair tied up high behind his head. His bangs are clipped back to show his forehead. \u201cGood morning, Childe.\u201d\nHe\u2019s so handsome. It\u2019s not fair.\u00a0\nChilde is going to explode like a Polycarpa mytiligera any second now and vanish into the depths of the Mariana Trench like a single-use plastic bag. He has the faintest urge to defenestrate himself directly from their fifth floor balcony, but Granny Ping probably wouldn\u2019t appreciate having to scrape his mangled body out of her flowerbeds, so instead, he asks, \u201cwhat time is it?\u201d\nZhongli turns back around to stir whatever he\u2019s cooking, barely maintaining a semblance of order in the atmosphere. \u201cYou slept past noon.\u201d\nChilde\u2019s five seconds away from freaking out over missing his classes before Zhongli adds on, \u201ctoday is Saturday.\u201d\n\u201c...Oh, thank god.\u201d\nThe older man gestures to him to sit down at the table before he serves lunch for the both of them\u2014the first time this has happened ever since Childe came to Liyue.\u00a0\n\u201cLooks good,\u201d Childe points out, already succumbing to the hunger pangs in his stomach and stabbing his fork into the biggest piece of meat in the bowl as he rests his chin on his palm, the issue of what happened last night temporarily forgotten, \u201cwhat\u2019s it called?\u201d\n\u201cBamboo shoot soup,\u201d Zhongli tells him, settling into his own seat at the table, still wearing Childe\u2019s Doraemon apron. \u201cIt is rather simple to make; four slices of the highest quality butt ham, first boiled to remove the surface blood, then stewed together with Qingce canned bamboo shoots, soy sauce, sesame oil, two eggs\u2026\u201d\nChilde zones out as he eats, his eyes drifting down to settle on Zhongli\u2019s bright eyes, focused as he recites each cooking step in immaculate detail, then down his straight, thin nose, then his red, red lips, before a vision of those same lips wrapping around his dick like a vice flashes in front of his eyes and his chin suddenly slides off his palm. \u201cAh!\u201d\n\u201cChilde?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cZhongli,\u201d Childe says, feeling a raging blush creep up his neck as he slams his hands onto the table. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d\n\u201cAbout?\u201d\n\u201cLast night.\u201d\nZhongli\u2019s chopsticks pause midair, a piece of cloud ear fungus dangling precariously from its tips.\u00a0\nHe stares at Childe.\u00a0\nChilde stares back.\u00a0\nNeither of them say anything. The piece of fungus drops into the soup below.\u00a0\nChilde\u2019s beginning to think that Zhongli\u2019s doing this on purpose for maximum psychological fuckery. The older man is usually quite expressive with his feelings despite his rock-steady stoicness\u2014either outright vocalising his thoughts or using small bits of body language to convey hidden emotions, but when Zhongli\u2019s making himself intentionally hard to read, it\u2019s like trying to extract meaning from a grassy hill.\nThe other man finally opens his mouth right when Childe hits the brink of insanity.\u00a0\n\u201c...What happened last night?\u201d\nChilde proceeds to dunk his entire head into his bowl of soup.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore,\u201d Childe sobs, falling onto his knees while clawing at Guizhong\u2019s blouse sleeve. He had taken the fastest train to Guili District he could find after lunch (and a shower to wash out the bits of pork from his hair), after mumbling a half-assed excuse and then slamming the door so hard that Morax let out an unholy yowl.  \u201cPlease Guizhong. Please evict me.\u201d\nGuizhong puts her hands on her hips, completely oblivious to the way passersby are staring at them and wondering why this woman has a grown man bawling on his knees at her feet. \u201cI am  not evicting you. I don't even own the place anymore!\u201d\n\u201cPlease!\u201d Childe tries again, hysterical, before Guizhong grabs him by the collar and hauls him up as easily as if he were a kitten.\n\u201cI have no idea what happened between you two,\u201d she tells him, dragging him along by the arm to the station exit, \u201cBut we are going to talk this out, and you and Zhongli are going to make it up to each other,\u201d she says firmly, before grumbling, \u201cAnd hopefully make out with each other while you\u2019re at it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c...So you two finally got some action going on,\u201d Guizhong summarises, and Childe nods, sinking deeper into Guizhong\u2019s plush leather sofa, \u201cAnd now you\u2019re  unhappy about that?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d He grumbles, wondering how far he needs to shrink into himself until he can become one with the furniture.\nGuizhong squints at him. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nChilde takes a deep breath. \u201cWell, Zhongli got invited to this party by a little green gremlin and he doesn\u2019t know jack shit about dressing for parties so I lent him a pair of my jeans that makes his ass look really hot and resigned myself to being the resident cat dad for the evening but later this dude picked the lock to our place to drop a really drunk Zhongli off and aforementioned drunk Zhongli then proceeded to pull down my pants and suck my dick but I don\u2019t just want him to suck my dick I want him to hold my hands but Zhongli would probably rather hold hands with his thesis on the Daedalia Planum lava flows on Mars than me so I guess my only remaining option is to commit sudoku.\u201d\nGuizhong stares.\n\u201cYou mean \u2018seppuku\u2019?\u201d\n\u201c...I said what I said.\"\n\u201cOkay.\u201d She says slowly. \u201cBut before you commit death by sudoku, have you asked  Zhongli what he thinks about the situation yet?\u201d\n\u201cI tried,\u201d Childe buries his head in his hands, \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t even remember what happened.\u201d\nHe can\u2019t even see anything other than the black behind his eyelids, but he can  feel the way the Guizhong winces.\n\u201cChilde,\u201d she starts, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nChilde groans. \u201cDon\u2019t be. It\u2019s not even your fault\u2014if anything, it\u2019s mine. I should have stopped it.\"\u00a0He flops backwards, staring at the ceiling.\n\u201cHe may have forgotten,\u201d Guizhong says, looking unusually solemn, \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t return your feelings.\u201d\nIf Childe stares hard enough, maybe he could burn a hole in the ceiling. \u201cHow can you sound so sure?\u201d\nGuizhong\u2019s lips pull upwards as she grasps Childe\u2019s hands. The man flinches, before he settles into reciprocating the hold. \u201cCall it a woman\u2019s intuition.\u201d\n\u201cIntuition?\u201d\nGuizhong laughs softly, \u201cThat, and the fact that Zhongli talks about you in every second text that he sends me must mean  something.\u201d \nChilde blinks owlishly. \u201cWhat does he say?\u201d\nA sly grin. \u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in that if I tell you? Come on now,\u201d she says, \u201cI think it\u2019s about time we push Zhongli outside his comfort zone a bit.\u201d\n\u201cDicksucking doesn\u2019t count?\u201d\n\u201cDicksucking doesn\u2019t count.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nOperation Spice Girls\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2740 Guizhong Ballista \u2740\n\n\n And apparently that\u2019s what happened! \n\n\u00a0\n\nKeqing.\u00a0\n\n\n What the fuck. \n\n\u00a0\nQueen MonAss \u2764\n\n I agree, what the fuck \n\n\u00a0\n\nNingguang (Do not contact me outside of work hours)\n\n\n Lmao. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAjax Spray-n-Wipe\n\n\n guys its not funny \n\n\n [Image Attachment] \n\n\n [Image Attachment] \n\n\n [Image Attachment] \n\n\u00a0\nQueen MonAss \u2764\n\n Okay we get it ure sad that ure blueballing yourself over him \n\n\nBut spamming gordon ramsay reaction images isn't going to make it better\n\n\u00a0\n\nKeqing.\u00a0\n\n\n How\u2026 did it feel? \n\n\u00a0\nQueen MonAss \u2764\n\n Keq ily but pls stop trying to take notes for ur fanfic \n\n\u00a0\n\nKeqing.\u00a0\n\n\n I\u2019M ONLY ASKING FOR\u00a0 \n\n\n SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. \n\n\u00a0\n\nNingguang (Do not contact me outside of work hours)\n\n\n So I take it we need a new plan. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAjax Spray-n-Wipe\n\n\n we never had a plan to begin with \n\n\u00a0\nQueen MonAss \u2764\n\n Any ideas? \n\n\u00a0\n\nNingguang (Do not contact me outside of work hours)\n\n\n I may have one. \n\n\n Give me some time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nOne week later finds Childe in the uni gym beating the shit out of the poor punching bags. So far, he\u2019s already snapped two bags from the hinge and punched apart the seams of another, but he\u2019ll just pay for them later. You know, no big deal. Haha.\n\u201cHey,\u201d someone calls to him off towards the side, and Childe only pauses momentarily from his vicious onslaught of violence towards insentient bags of sand to take in the tall stranger\u2019s one eye, black hair and slight smirk before he resumes throwing hands.\n\u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d he grunts, a trickle of sweat dripping down his temples.\nIn all honesty, he\u2019s not in the mood to talk. Even after Guizhong\u2019s little pep talk, he nevertheless ended up walking on eggshells for the past week, his internal turmoil and embarrassment compounded by Zhongli giving him his best sad puppy eyes (which, really, was just a more intense stare than usual),  Venti  of all people somehow finding out about the ordeal and proceeding to pester Diluc to pester Childe for details, and Childe waking up with a boner and fleeting memories of  red lips red eyeliner golden eyes every. Single. Morning.\u00a0\nSo it\u2019s understandable that he\u2019d be pissed, especially since he\u2019d also handed in his essay a day late thanks to spending excessive amounts of time stewing in his own emotional ineptness. But that\u2019s mostly a fault on his own part.\n\u201cName\u2019s Beidou,\u201d the tall woman replies, unfazed by Childe\u2019s hardheadedness. \u201cYou\u2019re friends with Ningguang, right?\u201d\n That gets Childe\u2019s attention, albeit he still doesn\u2019t stop punching. \u201cDunno if \u2018friends\u2019 is accurate here, we\u2019re more like acquaintances by circumstance.\u201d\nBeidou laughs, deep and jolly. \u201cFancy words, I like it. Anyways, I\u2019m Ningguang\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d\nA groan. \u201cI\u2019m assuming she told you about my trainwreck of a love life.\u201d\nBeidou rolls her one eye affectionately. \u201cOh, she yaps about it nonstop. Thinks it\u2019s the next best thing after the ending to Game of Thrones.\u201d\nChilde finally stops punching, confused. \u201cBut the Game of Thrones ending was shit.\u201d\n\u201cShe liked seeing the Twitter dumpster fire that came along with it.\u201d\n\u201cNingguang is weird,\u201d he declares with finality, ripping the velcro of his gloves to free his hands and wiping the sweat off his forehead.\u00a0\nBeidou shrugs. \u201cWell, she\u2019s  my weird girlfriend.\u201d\u00a0\nAfter watching Childe take off his other glove, she asks, \u201cHey, wanna arm wrestle?\u201d\nChilde looks at her, adrenaline still pumping through his veins. \u201cSure.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEight losses and a sprained wrist later, Childe is seriously reevaluating his manhood.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nBAEdou, Ajax Spray-n-Wipe\n\n\u00a0\n\n11:36pm\n\n\n so you're really not gonna tell me what ningguang is plotting?? \n\n\u00a0\n\n11:42pm\n\n\n Nope \n\n\n Swearing secrecy to her nefarious plans was part of the small print when i got together w/ her ;)\n\n\u00a0\n\n11:45pm\n\n\n gee, real helpful\n\n\n anyways when r u gonna be at the gym next? i still want a rematch \n\n\u00a0\n\n11:48pm\n\n\n Hahahaha get that wrist sorted out first! \n\n\n Dont wanna give u a disability for life ;D \n\n\u00a0\n\n11:49pm\n\n\n i have 2 hands! \n\n\u00a0\n\n11:51pm\n\n\n Unless ya plan on using your foot, i suggest you keep one to hold your roomie\u2019s hand lol \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next day, in which Zhongli is at the university running a supplementary tutoring class and Childe is at home procrastinating his presentation on the mating habits of sperm whales, the intercom rings unexpectedly.\nWhen Childe goes to pick it up, the mysterious visitor introduces herself shyly as Havria, and he instantly recognises her as the last missing piece to the Guizhong-Zhongli-Havria disaster childhood trio. He lets her up the elevator after she tells him she\u2019s here to drop off some things for Zhongli.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, Childe, tell me about yourself,\u201d Havria smiles, her features round and innocent, and Childe vaguely feels like he\u2019s acquainting himself with a future in-law. \u201cDo you work?\u201d\nHe pauses. He actually doesn\u2019t\u2014his parents are covering all his expenses, admittedly. But that indistinct in-law-interaction feeling is still there, and Childe doesn\u2019t want to lose face\u2026 even if he\u2019s pretty sure that Havria\u2019s not going to think any less of him if he just told her at face-value.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d Childe pauses, his eyes landing on a blob of brown fur in the corner of the room, \u201ca cat walker.\u201d\nHavria claps her hands together, completely missing the point. \u201cI  knew you looked like a model from the moment I saw you!\u201d\nChilde gives her a lopsided grin, neither affirming nor denying Havria\u2019s conclusion. He takes in Havria\u2019s delighted laugh, the soft contours of her face, the\u2026 oh.\u00a0\nHe can\u2019t help but notice\u2014\n\u201cAre you curious about my eye?\u201d She smiles at him, her voice dulcet and rippling, like calm ocean waves. Her glass eye looks natural enough from afar, and it does nothing to detract from her gentle, ethereal aura.\n\u201cA bit,\u201d Childe admits, scratching at his cheek.\u00a0\nHe thinks about Beidou, in all of her bulging biceps, fierce grin kind of glory, and then he thinks about Kaeya\u2014the captain of the fencing club he sometimes attends\u2014with his sly smirk and flawless coin flips, and wonders if Havria could also pull off the same sexy pirate look that seems to go so well with the lack of depth perception. Probably not.\u00a0\nHe helps Havria place her numerous shopping bags onto the counter of their kitchen island, and while Havria unpacks the contents, she explains ruefully, \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder of all my past mistakes. I\u2019m lucky to have only lost an eye from it.\u201d\nChilde bites his lip, almost opens his mouth to tell her that he won\u2019t pry for details, that it\u2019s okay to not tell him. But Havria continues on, taking out a bundle of fresh Jueyun chilis and placing it in the fruit bowl. \u201cA long time ago, I got involved in\u2026 an incident, of sorts, and my frivolous life was placed in danger by people I thought I could trust,\u201d she smiles, her voice wispy and far away.\u00a0\nChilde doesn\u2019t say anything, simply standing there after most of the groceries have been located to their rightful places.\u00a0\n\u201cBut Zhongli was the one to pull me out, to convince me that self-destruction and sacrifice for those people wasn\u2019t worth it,\u201d a small grin, \u201cHe and Guizhong even beat a few of them black and blue\u2026. this eye,\u201d she pauses, \u201cis a remnant of our darkest days.\u201d\nChilde stills, somehow feeling as if he is suddenly intruding on something very private between Guizhong, Zhongli, and Havria. Something that shouldn\u2019t be so easily unearthed\u2014especially not for an outsider like him.\u00a0\nHavria looks fixedly at him for a few seconds before her gaze drops down. She points at the bag of salt he holds in his hands. \u201cUniodized sea salt from the salt plains of Guyun. Zhongli\u2019s favourite.\u201d\nChilde blinks. He didn\u2019t think it was possible for someone to have a favourite  salt,  but his roommate is already unconventional enough that nothing really phases him anymore. Then, the realisation that Childe doesn\u2019t actually  know anything about Zhongli at all, apart from having an inclination towards the traditional and intricate, hits him almost like a punch in the gut.\nHe swallows the lump in his throat. \u201cYou came all the way from\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSal Terrae.\u201d\n\u201c...Sal Terrae, just to bring him groceries, and a bag of salt?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do,\u201d Havria laughs softly, \u201cZhongli used to always forget to buy groceries, and Guizhong was so busy with her internship that she often slept in her office. I couldn\u2019t sit around and watch that man starve himself, so it became a habit to shop for him as well.\u201d\nChilde suppresses a snort, trying his best to ignore the sinking feeling in his gut (because how is  he supposed to slot himself into Zhongli\u2019s life when everyone else around him has already been able to find their place long ago?), \u201cI understand. He\u2019s definitely a handful sometimes.\u201d\nThey end up moving to talk on the couch, joined by Morax purring contentedly in Havria\u2019s lap while the pale-haired woman gently runs her fingers through long, brown fur.\u00a0\n\u201cI heard you like Zhongli.\u201d Havria says suddenly.\nChilde chokes.\u00a0\n\u201cGuizhong told you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d he grumbles halfheartedly, making a mental note to berate the Spice Girls chat later\u2014 especially  Ningguang and Guizhong\u2014for saying  too much.  Havria smiles at him, and that\u2019s all the confirmation he needs.\n\u201cGuizhong is wise beyond her years, but keeping secrets was never her forte,\u201d she continues. \u201cRest assured, I know she respects you enough to not tell anyone else about it.\u201d\nChilde stares at Morax, not wanting to meet Havria\u2019s gentle, yet seemingly omniscient gaze. \u201cIs trying to play matchmaker also a sign of her respect?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2014\u201d Havria starts, but the sound of the front door opening causes them to both turn their heads to see Zhongli toeing off his shoes at the entrance.\n\u201cI\u2019m home\u2026\u201d he looks up, golden eyes widening at the sight of their guest. \u201cHavria?\u201d\nHavria\u2019s face blossoms into a brilliant smile, one that could rival Liyue\u2019s nighttime cityscape. \u201cZhongli,\u201d she greets, standing up.\nChilde watches, stiff, as the two embrace. He stares at the way all the tension drains from Zhongli\u2019s shoulders, the way his eyes light up with joy. He looks so  happy, and Childe sourly wonders if he\u2019ll ever be able to see this kind of radiance directed at him instead. But he\u2019s not mad at Zhongli. He\u2019s not even mad at Havria. He knows that what he\u2019s feeling is nothing but a result of his own selfishness.\n\u201cI have not heard from you in months.\u201d Zhongli mumbles into the shorter woman\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve been so worried.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m moving back to Fontaine.\u201d Havria says suddenly. Zhongli pulls himself back, and his face falls like a meteorite impacting upon the earth. \u201cThis is the last time I\u2019ll see you in a while.\u201d\n\u201cFontaine?\u201d The older man\u2019s voice wavers.\nShe nods. \u201cMy mother is ill. I\u2019m going back to look after her.\u201d\n\u201c...Oh.\u201d The taller man somehow manages to look absolutely heartbroken with the bare minimum amount of facial expression.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be upset,\u201d the younger woman laughs reassuringly, \u201cI\u2019ll fly back to see you and Guizhong whenever I can.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI am not upset.\u201d Zhongli deadpans, evidently upset. \u201cI simply worry that you may disappear again, just as you did\u2026 back then.\u201d\nHavria gently takes his hands, her touch soft like the cresting waves of a low tide. \u201cThat was all in the past\u2014I have grown wiser now, and you have as well. It\u2019s time to let go. Let some new people into your life.\u201d She glances at Childe. \u201cYou know that Guizhong and I won\u2019t be around to coddle you forever.\u201d\nZhongli looks down sadly at their intertwined fingers, \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey say their goodbyes after that, with Zhongli promising to see Havria off the airport on the day of her departure. After she leaves, Childe ushers a listless Zhongli to the kitchen and shoves a tub of discounted Ben and Jerry\u2019s ice cream and a spoon into his hands, the awkwardness of the last week completely dissipated in the face of Zhongli\u2019s quiet melancholy.\n\u201cChilde,\u201d Zhongli says softly, albeit suddenly, standing next to the kitchen island with his eyes downcast, \u201ccan I tell you something?\u201d\nThe younger man squeezes Zhongli\u2019s shoulder reassuringly. \u201cYou can tell me anything you want. Always. But maybe we shouldn\u2019t have this heart-to-heart in the kitchen of all places.\u201d\nAfter refilling Morax\u2019s food bowl and relocating to the couch, Zhongli speaks up again. \u201cHas Guizhong told you much about our childhood?\u201d\n\u201cGuizhong? No, not really,\u201d Childe replies while flicking through the channels, trying to act casual about the topic but probably failing quite badly on that front. Not that Zhongli notices. \u201cAll I know is that you were a kickass little fighter in your prime years,\u201d he grins.\nZhongli chuckles, holding a hand up to his mouth. \u201cMaybe. Perhaps I\u2019ve gotten rusty over the years, now that I think about it.\u201d\nA good-natured laugh. \u201cI\u2019m always up for a spar if you want. My bones haven\u2019t gotten quite as old as yours just yet.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to turn down your offer, regrettably,\u201d Zhongli smiles, tearing the seal off the top of his ice cream tub. \u201cLet\u2019s watch this one,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always NatGeo,\u201d Childe groans while setting down the remote. \u201cAnything for you though.\u201d\nHe settles back into a comfortable position, willing to wait until Zhongli gathers his thoughts enough to share them\u2014or not share them, either is fine.\nIt only hits him now that this might have been what he wanted all along; the warmth of the body next to his, the waking city lights, the waning evening glow. In the midst of all the hustling days that flow right past his eyes, it\u2019s moments like this that seem to stretch out forever.\u00a0\n\u201cGuizhong and I met Havria when we were eight years old,\u2019 Zhongli begins. \u201cCan you imagine being two little children with just the clothes on their backs, holding slingshots, and accidentally hitting the only daughter of a respected politician?\u201d He laughs. \u201cQuite amusing to think about, in retrospect.\u201d\nThat takes Childe by surprise. \u201cYou mean, she was\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cQuite different from us, really.\u201d Zhongli says. \u201cBut the three of us became friends soon regardless, and she would always visit us in the Plains and bring us gifts, while we could only offer our hospitality.\u201d\n\u00a0\n(\u201cHavria,\u201d Zhongli poked the other girl and stared at her with innocent, questioning eyes, \u201cAre you  really sure  that you want to be friends with us? I know that you\u2019re from the city, and that the people there don\u2019t exactly\u2014ouch!\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d Guizhong yelled as she pinched her best friend\u2019s ear, earning a few yelps of pain. \u201cThat\u2019s not something you just say to your friends, you know! What if it hurts her feelings! Doofus!\u201d\n\u201cGuizhong, don\u2019t do that\u2014ow, ow\u2026 that hurts!\u201d\nHavria laughed at the scene in front of her, her frilly white frock a stark contrast from the dry landscape of the Plains. A sudden breeze caused dust to be caught in her neat, long hair, and yet she didn\u2019t seem to mind at all.\nEven with Havria\u2019s bodyguards waiting just around the corner and the brutal rays of a midday sun bearing down on them, her smile seemed so naturally radiant that Zhongli looked away in fear of blinding himself.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 always had trouble making friends because of my dad\u2019s status,\u201d Havria confessed shyly, her cheeks flushed with happiness. \u201cSo I\u2019m very happy to have met you two.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t care about your fancy parents or fame!\u201d Guizhong jumped away from Zhongli to grab the shorter girl\u2019s hands. \u201cWe like you because you\u2019re  you!\u201d \nZhongli rubbed his ear and nodded as well. The flat expression on his face belied the sincerity in his eyes. \u201cYeah. If you ever need anything, we\u2019ll always be here for you.\u201d\n\u201cPromise?\u201d\n\u201cPromise.\u201d\n\u201cPromise!\u201d)\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt was only a few months after that when her father was assassinated,\u201d Zhongli says plainly, and Childe winces from the whiplash. \u201cAllegedly, he made a lot of enemies through acts of corruption. Havria and her mother sought refuge in the Plains\u00a0for years, before Havria moved with us to Liyue Harbour, and her mother flew back to Fontaine.\u201d\n\u201cThat,\u201d Childe pauses, picking carefully at his words. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty wild. I wasn\u2019t expecting that.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us did.\u201d Zhongli says wistfully, a faint smile tugging at his lips. \u201cBut even though the three of us went through our fair share of hardships, sometimes I can\u2019t help but feel nostalgic about the past. Everyone seems so eager to move on into the next chapter of their life, and yet some nights I still dream of when we all laughed together under that harsh, rural sun. Is that\u2026 is that wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Childe replies immediately, his eyes glued to the television showing a chimpanzee trying to fit a whole grapefruit in its mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut?\u201d\nChilde turns his head. Zhongli looks back at him with half his face illuminated by harsh, artificial light, mouth set into a thin line. Under the rigid lines of his face lies a storm of uncertainty\u2014and in the middle of it all, is just a boy who has yet to find a purpose beyond simply protecting the ones he holds dear.\n\u201cWell. Are you happy now?\u201d he asks softly.\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d Zhongli whispers back. The worry across his face breaks apart like sheets of ice welcoming new cracks, and it\u2019s mesmerising in a way Childe never thought could be. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade the happiness I have now for anything in the world.\u201d\nSomething glints in his eyes, bright in a way that makes Childe think there\u2019s more to those words than he thinks. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I should be grateful. Guizhong and Havria live better lives now, times are peaceful now, but more importantly\u2026 you are here too.\u201d\nFeeling a strange heat bloom across his cheeks, Childe quickly looks away, suddenly feeling very hot under the collar.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s\u2026 let\u2019s stop there. Uh, hm, you know what always helps in times like this?\u201d he says, pulling his phone out hastily.\nZhongli stares at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Some good ol\u2019 retail therapy!\u201d Childe grins, heart swelling at the sight of his roommate perking up with interest.\nThey spend the rest of the evening on the couch browsing Amazon for new cat slippers (to replace the pair Zhongli had worn a hole into), stupid little antiques to add to their ever-growing collection around the house (Childe adds a tiny acrylic Waldo figurine into the cart when the other isn\u2019t looking), and miniature Christmas hats they could put on Roomba and Morax (even though Christmas is still more than six months away).\u00a0\nWhen Zhongli dozes off leaning against Childe\u2019s shoulder with a dragon-patterned blanket wrapped around his shoulders, Childe gently pulls the spoon from his mouth, the molten ice cream from his hands, snuggles in next to him with a blanket of his own, breath caressing the dark-haired man\u2019s cheeks, and thinks that just maybe, the two of them, simply staying like this...\u00a0\n(This is okay, too.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you leave the group chat  again?\u201d Mona interrogates him in the library a few days later, catching him in a merciless headlock that contradicts her delicate stature.\n \u201cHrrgk,  Mona\u2014\u201d he wheezes, clawing at her rock-solid grip, \u201cI\u2019m  choking\u2014\u201d\nMona releases her steely hold with a  harrumph, and Childe wheezes overdramatically before flopping onto the table face down like a beached whale, fake-gasping for air.\n\u201cTalk.\u201d She instructs, crossing her arms and furrowing her brows.\nChilde winces as he pushes himself up and rubs at his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t think this whole thing is gonna work out.\u201d\nMona looks at him as if he had just declared that the earth is flat and the entire night sky is just an elaborate hoax. \u201cThe hell? Of course it\u2019s gonna work out. We just need to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he interrupts her, uncharacteristically twiddling his thumbs, \u201cI\u2026 I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if this all fails in the end.\u201d\nMona goes silent, before she slides into the seat opposite of him, digging her elbows into the table. Her eyes are softer now, silver upon baby blue hues wide open with concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? This isn\u2019t like you.\u201d\nChilde laughs. The sound comes out a little scratchy, like an old record. \u201cWhat do you mean, this isn\u2019t like me?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the type of guy to back down from a challenge.\u201d Mona points out. \u201cSo what gives this time? Why are you scared?\u201d\nChilde stares at his thumbs, eyes tracing a faint scar zigzagging from his second knuckle to the wrist. \u201cI dunno, Mona. I\u2019ve had flings and stuff in the past but\u2026 I\u2019ve never really felt anything like this before. I don\u2019t want to fuck this up\u2014this, whatever we have right now. I\u2019m happy with it.\u201d\n(Because it\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t know what  love  feels like\u2014sure, Childe has had plenty of tastes of the enticing possibilities that a significant other can bring\u2026 but Zhongli is different. Zhongli is opaque,  unconventional in comparison to all the other partners Childe has known, to the point where it makes Childe feels like he wears his heart on his sleeve, simply because it always feels like Zhongli can see right through Childe, even if Childe can\u2019t read him back.\nAnd it\u2019s so easy for Childe to simultaneously love him like family\u2014like the unconditional love he gives towards his own siblings\u2014whilst still yearn for something a little  more. But it\u2019s hard to tell if Zhongli feels anything in return, and of the few things that Childe likes to play it safe with in his life, love is, surprisingly, one of them.)\nThe hobbyist astrologist wrinkles her nose. \u201cWho says they can\u2019t? Not with  that attitude.\u201d\n\u201cHave you been reading too many of Keqing\u2019s fanfics?\u201d he teases, and rightfully gets whacked on the head for it with a thick book. \"Ow!\"\n\u201c\u2018Ow\u2019 is  right, you lonely, pining nerd,\u201d Mona huffs. \u201cThis is just sad. Seeing you and him practically being an old married couple in all but name. You cook for him, clean for him, study with him, raise a cat with him\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut  what else  am I meant to  do?\u201d  Childe runs a hand through his messy hair and resists the urge to shriek, \u201cI\u2019m literally his roommate by contract! It\u2019s in big black bold print on a big white piece of dead tree skin! And he\u2019s kind of a disaster sometimes too you know, like, I can\u2019t  not sit by the side and just\u2026 watch his life fall apart. Hence the cooking and cleaning and drying and\u2014\u201d\nMona slaps her hand on the table, her eyes alight in a way that Childe has never seen before. \u201cSo you\u2019re letting your feelings be dictated by a few lines of text? Huh? What kind of excuse is this? Just because we know that the night sky is nothing more than a few billion balls of gas sitting in a dead vacuum of nothingness, does that stop us from giving each star a name? A story? A happy ending that we all hope to see reflected in ourselves?\u201d\nChilde shrinks down into his seat, his eyes looking over to the students who are walking by and shooting them curious glances.\nMona lets out a suffering sigh that deflates her like a balloon, and slides back to her side of the table. She flips open the book that she used to murder a few of Childe\u2019s brain cells with five minutes ago, and beckons the other to shuffle closer. \u201cLet me show you something\u2026 See this?\u201d\nChilde peers over to look at the page. It\u2019s an astrology compendium, full of neat diagrams and visuals and thus perfect for an ignorant cretin like him. He frowns. \u201cSee what?\u201d\n\u201cThis,\u201d Mona traces a neatly manicured finger along the lines of one particular diagram of a constellation and smiles, as if she were gazing at an old friend, \u201cis the Monoceros Caeli, a faint constellation only visible on certain nights.\u201d\u00a0\nChilde skims his eyes across the page, skipping from its discovery to a list of its major stars, to a very blurry, very dubious picture of what is labelled as the \u2018fox fur nebula\u2019. The photograph of the Monoceros Caeli itself is clear; a methodically labelled diagram of a set of bright stars, arranged in a curving triangular shape, reminiscent of a graceful creature of the seas.\n\u201cAnd this,\u201d Mona flips a few pages forward, navigating through the text almost as easily as if it were the back of her hand, \u201cis the Lapis Dei, a more rigid celestial arrangement that carries auspicious fortune in Liyuen culture due to the fact that it can be visibly seen once a year.\u201d This time, she draws his attention to a distinctly diamond-shaped constellation, unyielding and faultless.\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s the interesting thing;\u201d she explains. \u201cOnce every six thousand years or so, thanks to the rotation of the Milky Way aligning with the axial tilt and orbital position of the earth, the Monoceros Caeli and Lapis Dei will align in the sky to create an entirely different constellation that has only ever been observed once in the Bronze Age.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Childe nods slowly, mildly interested. \u201cBut why are you telling me this?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Mona continues, circling her finger in the air, \u201cBack during the Fontainian Renaissance, there arose a belief that the astrological configurations you were born under would determine your fate. It was through this emerging belief that astrology made its way into the mainstream arts like theatre, as more and more people began exploring the connection of the human psyche with the celestial realm.\u201d\nChilde gives her a blank look.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to tell you,\u201d she taps him on the forehead, \u201cis that whenever you find yourself lost, remember that the stars in the sky will always have a place for you. The universe is the foundation for existence, and that we are all composed from its very essence. To accept whatever that may come in our lives\u2014that is the will of the stars.\u201d\n\u201c...I still don\u2019t get it,\u201d Childe tells her truthfully.\u00a0\nMona smiles back at him with an enigmatic pull of the lips, and the glittering of galaxies within her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cChilde.\u201d\n\u201cHowy  fhuck!\u201d The ginger-haired male jumps, his screech muffled by his mouthful of egg rolls. Seeing that it\u2019s just Zhongli, he calms down and swallows his food properly. \u201cYou scared me.\u201d\nZhongli sniffs. \u201cIs there something about one o\u2019clock in the morning that always makes me seem more frightening than usual?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a very humane hour to be awake at.\u201d Childe points out, shoving another egg roll in his mouth.\n\u201cBut you are awake as well.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMunchies.\u201d\n\u201c...Of course.\u201d\nChilde beckons his roommate over to the couch, and grins lopsidedly. \u201cIf you can\u2019t sleep, then join me?\u201d\nZhongli smiles at that, relieved that Childe isn\u2019t acting so awkwardly around him anymore, especially after he used the other man as his impromptu counsellor the other night. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nThey end up huddling together to flick through the channels again, with Morax soon slinking out of Zhongli\u2019s room after sensing his owner\u2019s absence. Seeing Morax curl himself contentedly around Childe\u2019s neck like a fat fur scarf, Zhongli quietly gets up and returns with a familiar black circle in his arms.\nChilde squints at him against the harsh light of the television.\n\u201c...We are not bringing Roomba into our TV cuddling sessions.\u201d\nThe brunette looks downwards. \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t it get lonely?\u201d\n\u201cZhongli, that\u2019s a robot.\u201d Childe points out fruitlessly.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cAnd\u2026 robots are not... um\u2026 okay. Fine. He can join us. Stop giving me those eyes.\u201d\nAnd if acknowledging a circular vacuum robot (that gets fed dubious things into its dustbin every so often) as sentient is all it takes to make Zhongli beam at him like he\u2019s the entire world, then, well, maybe it\u2019s worth it. Sometimes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChilde sees Ningguang in the flesh for the first time when he and Zhongli are getting a rare lunch together between classes.\u00a0\n\u201cYou two. Saturday. Meet at the entrance of Draffland at ten, and don\u2019t be tardy.\u201d She slaps a hand down onto their table of the cafe, her bright golden nails refracting the sunlight directly into Childe\u2019s eyes.\nChilde flinches away and looks upwards, instantly recognising her from Beidou\u2019s social media posts, the two of them practically glued together in every single picture.\nNingguang is the epitome of an independent woman; her entire aura asserting ambition and influence with her thin pencil skirt, twelve centimeter heels and bright carmine lipstick. No wonder Beidou is so head over heels for her.\n\u201cNingguang,\u201d Zhongli says calmly, as if he were already used to the spontaneous demands of his second-in-command. \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d\nNingguang only replies with a knowing little smirk, her gleaming ruby eyes thinning with mirth as she waves two colourful tickets in front of their faces and sets them on the table. \u201cIf you come, you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2026 is this?\u201d Childe asks on Saturday at ten o\u2019clock in the morning in front of Draffland Theme Park.\nToday, the weather is fine, the crowds are fine, Zhongli\u2019s voluminous ass in those tight black pants are fine\u2026 everything is fine, he tries to tell himself, but Ningguang's subtle smirk does nothing to alleviate the apprehension stewing in his gut.\n\u201cA double date!\u201d Beidou supplies excitedly, a pair of fluffy ears already sitting on top of her head. Next to her, Ningguang is sporting a similar headband albeit with a big red bow in the middle. They\u2019re wearing matching coloured blouses, although Ningguang has hers neatly tucked into the edges of her skirt whilst Beidou\u2019s is ripped open at the top to show a distracting amount of cleavage.\nThe ginger-haired man splutters. Everything is suddenly not fine. \u201cA  double date?\u201d \n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Ningguang uses Childe\u2019s temporarily petrified state to plant a set of fluffy ears on top of his head, \u201cit\u2019s a good opportunity for us to relax a little before our workloads pick up the pace again.\u201d\n\u201cUm. I thought you just needed us here to, like, take photos for your date or something. Like an amusement park photoshoot,\u201d Childe turns around towards Zhongli, a nervous smile on his face. \u201cRight?\u201d\n\u201cI actually agree with Ningguang,\u201d Zhongli rubs at his chin thoughtfully, \u201cit does seem like an optimal time to unwind from the irrational stress stemming from the institutionalised pressure of our unnecessarily convoluted education system. Why not take the opportunity?\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI also want to ride the teacups,\u201d Zhongli adds with a glint in his eyes.\nChilde turns around and sighs, completely and utterly defeated. Beidou flashes a winning grin and fistbumps her girlfriend. \u201cOkay. I guess it\u2019s a date, then.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan we\u2026 go back to the teacups\u2026\u201d Childe mutters petulantly as he tugs at the sleeve of Zhongli\u2019s woollen coat (which is practically riddled with brown cat fur because Morax loves using it as his personal blanket, but that doesn\u2019t stop Zhongli wearing it out all the time and smelling like cat), \u201cthe teacups were great\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou almost vomited after we rode the teacups,\u201d Zhongli says gently, rubbing at Childe's shoulders, \u201cI think it\u2019s best if we have a change of pace from the high velocity attractions.\u201d\n\u201cIf we go in there,\u201d Childe points shakily at the huge haunted house that Zhongli is steering the group towards, \u201cI think  my heart will be the one going at high velocity instead.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be a fun experience,\u201d Zhongli catches Childe\u2019s clammy hands into his and squeezes reassuringly, \u201ctrust me.\u201d\n\u201cFun for you who loves to dissect the workings of every single ride here,\u201d he grumbles, acutely and devastatingly aware of how sweaty his palms are whilst in Zhongli\u2019s firm grasp. \u201cStill dunno how you managed to keep talking about gravitational potential or whatever while we were literally going  full speed on the rollercoaster.\u201d\n\u201cA mouthful of insects ain\u2019t gonna stop this guy\u2019s ramblings,\u201d Beidou belly-laughs next to them before she devours half of Ningguang\u2019s fairy floss in one swift bite. \u201cSurely you knew that after living with him for, how long?\u201d\n\u201cI told you we should\u2019ve bought two.\u201d Ningguang sighs before surrendering the rest of her fairy floss to Beidou\u2019s Kirby-esque appetite. Beidou plucks the confectionery out of the platinum-blonde woman\u2019s hands and finishes the entire thing off in the blink of an eye.\n\u201cNah,\u201d the taller woman grins from ear to ear, mouth full of sugar, \u201ctastes better when you give it to me,\u201d she says, before leaning down to kiss the other on the lips.\n\u201cGross.\u201d Childe mutters as he yanks Zhongli\u2019s arm and pulls him towards the haunted house, jumping a little when a jack-in-the-box suddenly springs up next to them. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go and get this over with.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere\u2019s all that manliness you had when you kept challenging me to arm wrestling?\u201d\n\u201cSh-shut up, Beidou!\u201d\n\u201cBeidou, watch your head.\u201d\n \u201cAck! \u2026Spiderwebs? Wow, this place sure ain\u2019t tall-people friendly.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just your lack of depth perception. Zhongli and Childe are doing just fine.\u201d\n\u201cTo think that they would employ the use of such advanced animatronics for the mere purpose of entertainment, fascinating.\u201d\n\u201cZhongli, this isn\u2019t some Five Nights At Freddy\u2019s\u2014oh my fucking lord almighty. Zhongli, come back, don\u2019t walk towards the zombie ZHONGLI  STOP TOUCHING THE ZOMBIE.\u201d\n\u201cNing, are we gonna have to reimburse the place if we break one of their attractions?\u201d\nA laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll cover it.\u201d\nAs the four make their way deeper into the haunted house, Childe begins to feel more and more lightheaded with every jumpscare and dismembered limb that he sees. He ends up clutching onto Zhongli\u2019s sleeve and sweats into the fabric as Zhongli unabashedly goes up to each little moving contraption and prop to examine and explain them in his typical factual manner.\nMeanwhile, Beidou has moved from holding Ningguang around the waist and laughing off her nerves, to clenching her one eye shut and letting the other woman carefully guide them both through the darkness.\u00a0\n\u2026So it\u2019s to be expected with Ningguang trying to speedrun the experience for the sake of Beidou\u2019s pride, and Zhongli striking up a long one-sided conversation with a headless clown, that they, inevitably, get split up.\n\u201cUm, Zhongli.\u201d Childe tries to pretend his voice didn\u2019t crack at the last syllable, to little avail. \u201c\u2026I think we lost Ningguang and Beidou.\u201d\nZhongli turns around amidst the tacky stage smoke and cotton cobwebs, face ghostly and eerie under the foggy green lighting. Regardless, his amber eyes still manage to pierce through the dimness like a beacon at a harbour, and it would be a beautiful sight to behold if the atmosphere wasn\u2019t so terrifying.\n\u201cDid we?\u201d\nSomething behind Zhongli moves, creaks, and all of a sudden Childe feels faint, all the blood in his body furiously running 1.8 meter sprint laps between his brain and toes. \u201cY... yeah. Can we go now? Please?\u201d\n\u201cHold on a moment,\u201d something catches the man\u2019s bright eyes, and he moves towards a much more intact looking clown looming ominously in the corner.  This clown is caked in blood and gore and what looks like bits of internal organs hanging out of his afro, his beady golden eyes latching onto their every move like a leech. But Zhongli doesn\u2019t seem to pay all that any mind and continues to move towards it without a single fibre of self-preservation in his body.\u00a0\nAnd then. And then he does the unspeakable.\u00a0\nHe grabs the clown\u2019s bright red nose.\u00a0\n \u201cOw!\u201d  the clown shrieks, jerking backwards and Zhongli reels back in mild surprise as, instead,  Childe  who is standing three meters away and nowhere near homicide-by-clown vicinity manages to get out one final garbled noise of distress before he faints for real this time.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Childe comes back to consciousness, he finds himself lying face up against what feels like a very uncomfortable bed, and gingerly cracks his eyes open to thankfully see a white ceiling instead of the musty, damp inside of the haunted house.\nWonderful.\n\u201cUgh.\u201d He winces. The back of his head throbs in pain from where it must\u2019ve banged against the floor, sending an uncomfortable ringing through his ears. Luckily, it doesn\u2019t seem to be serious enough to be a concu\u2014\nZhongli\u2019s worried face suddenly pops into his field of view, his bangs hanging down like a dark curtain, and this time Childe has enough experience to not reflexively headbutt the other man.\nThey stay like that for a few moments, both sides suspended in what feels like disbelief, before Zhongli curves his lips upwards.\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d he murmurs softly, cautious, almost as if he\u2019s expecting the man under him to faint again at any moment.\nChilde grins upwards, breathless with awe. \u201cOf course I am. Takes more than a clown to put me out of commission.\u201d A lie, but Zhongli isn\u2019t the type to call other people out on petty things like that.\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d Zhongli exhales, his lips parting with relief, still beautiful even upside down. \u201cI was so worried.\u201d\nChilde sits up, reluctantly looking away from the other man to take in his surroundings. They\u2019re in a medical bay of sorts, surprisingly with no one else around, not even nurses. Strange. Zhongli takes a seat in one of the chairs next to the bed.\u00a0\n\u201cYou were worried about me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Zhongli replies solemnly, \u201cYou are an important person to me.\u201d\n\u201c...Huh.\u201d He blinks, replaying the words in his head like a broken record. \u201cAm I.\u201d  An important person. \n\u201cListen, Childe,\u201d Zhongli starts, refusing to make eye contact. It\u2019s weird, Childe realises, because Zhongli has never  not made eye contact while speaking, but he doesn\u2019t get the chance to dwell on what that could possibly mean before the other man continues, \u201cI have been thinking, ever since Havria bid her farewells, that maybe it is indeed time for me to step outside my comfort zone.\u201d\n\u201c...Zhongli?\u201d Childe can\u2019t help but frown a little, confused as to why the other man is suddenly bringing up this particular topic while in the middle of a deserted first aid bay with the stupid-looking Draffland headbands still sitting on their heads. But there's something about the terseness in the older man's shoulders and the way he fidgets with his fingers that convinces Childe that yes, they are indeed having their second official heart-to-heart in the middle of a medical bay in a kids' theme park.\n\u201cAnd I must confess,\u201d the other man rambles on without stopping, still opting to stare at an unnaturally green plastic pot plant in the corner of the room rather than Childe\u2019s face, \u201cAt first I was only following Guizhong\u2019s lead\u2014that if she decided it was necessary for me to have a companion in her absence, then I told myself I would accept her decision. And it was silly of me, in retrospect, to continue to yearn for her presence when you were with me. Because after what happened with Havria, I was reluctant to truly accept anyone else into my life in fear that maybe... maybe something like that would happen again. That it\u2019ll be too easy to lose someone I care for.\u201d\nHe bites his lip, then looks up at Childe with a wobbly smile. Childe\u2019s never seen this kind of expression on him, and it almost feels unreal to see such uncertainty seep through Zhongli\u2019s face like a splintering crack in the earth. \u201cI apologise. I seem to have lost my composure a little.\u201d\nChilde slowly angles his body towards the brunette, hesitant, and Zhongli continues on with quiet determination.\n\u201cI realise now, after almost losing you, that I have been nothing but selfish,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cThat you are perhaps no less important to me. Or perhaps even more.\u201d\n\u201cZhongli,\u201d Childe can\u2019t help the goofy grin that shimmies its way onto his lips upon hearing those words, giddiness swelling up in his chest like a balloon, \u201cIt\u2019s just a mild concussion.\u201d\nThe other man finally shifts his eyes over to meet Childe\u2019s deep blue hues, bright topaz shimmering with steely resolve. Childe, on the other hand, is still grinning like a madman (maybe there  was a little bit of a concussion), and not quite processing the last few seconds.\u00a0\nThen, his mouth drops open.\n \u201cNow kiss,\u201d  a voice hisses from behind the door, but before Childe can turn to question it, Zhongli is already descending upon him, pressing his soft, red lips onto Childe\u2019s own. Childe stutters out a yelp of surprise, his body frozen as his mind revs into overdrive, and  suddenly, as Zhongli runs his tongue against chapped lips, nothing else in the world matters anymore\u2014not the throbbing pain in his head, not hideous ugly headless clowns casually standing around in haunted houses, and certainly not the fact that Childe\u2019s cat ear headband has just slipped down and is now digging very uncomfortably into the junction between his ear and nape.\nZhongli\u2019s mouth is open, warm, chaste, the little puffs of air between them tickling the sides of his mouth. It\u2019s brazen yet bashful, and Zhongli himself tastes like  years of barely veiled loneliness, resigned acceptance, social reclusivity, and a hint of the caramel ice cream they had gotten for lunch, all in one handsome, bright-eyed package.\n\u201cI actually\u2026\u201d the older man pants when they break apart for oxygen, \u201chave not forgotten that night. After the party. In fact, I hold my alcohol better than Diluc thinks I do.\u201d\u00a0\nChilde looks at him with wild eyes, oxygen heavy in his lungs. \u201cSo\u2026 it was on purpose? You\u2026 coming onto me?\u201d\nZhongli closes his eyes serenely as he brushes his forehead against Childe\u2019s, disarmingly tender. \u201cYes, it was. Just an excuse.\u201d\nThen he meets Childe\u2019s mouth again, closing his eyes and making small, wanton sounds against wet teeth and skin, all while Childe sits frozen on the spot, silently screaming  what!!!!! as his brain unhelpfully proceeds to loop Careless Whisper on endless repeat to emphasise the fact that his entire life is basically just one big Kermit meme.\nAnd then, the unmistakable sound of a zip being pulled down. Childe\u2019s zip. Childe\u2019s  pant zip.\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d he can\u2019t help but murmur into the kiss, and yet still goes to tilt his head to slot their lips together much more easily. \u201cYou actually want me.\u201d\nZhongli is the one that breaks them apart, shifting his weight so that he drapes across Childe\u2019s lower half, pawing at his crotch.\u00a0\n\u201cI do,\u201d he affirms, and bends downwards. When Childe dumbly tells him that they are in the medical bay of a childrens\u2019 theme park, Zhongli simply gives him a confused look, and Childe gives up.\n\u201cOkay. Hold on,\u201d he mutters, face beet red and hand pushing against Zhongli\u2019s forehead as the latter presses his face towards Childe\u2019s still-clothed dick, \u201cI need to get something straight. Is this, now, like, a roommates with benefits kind of thing, or are we actually\u2014\u201d\n\u201cChilde.\u201d Zhongli says lowly\u2014molten, lucid eyes peering out from under the ginger\u2019s palm. \u201cI like you.\u201d\n Oh my god, is what runs through Childe\u2019s head. But what comes out of his mouth is, instead, \u201cAnd you confess to me\u2026 through sucking my dick\u2026. again?\u201d\n\u201c...Yes.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI feel as if I owe you a\u2026 less inebriated experience.\u201d\n\u201c...\u201d\n\u201c...\u201d\n\u201c...God, I just don\u2019t know how someone can have the soul of an old man and the stamina of a horny teen all in one body,\u201d Childe protests fruitlessly, letting his hand be moved off to the side. \u201cIf we get arrested for public indecency, it\u2019s on you.\u201d\nZhongli shoots him a look. \u201cYou can be so rude sometimes,\u201d he mutters petulantly before he tucks a strand of hair behind his ear and dips his head down.\nBut there\u2019s a brief moment where Childe catches a flash of purple behind the opaque window of the med bay door and Zhongli is sliding his lips against his thin boxers and then there\u2019s a shuffle outside the room and\u2014\nthe door flings open\u2014\nand in tumbles Keqing then Mona then Beidou then a clown (?!) all yelling and falling and congesting into one big, groaning pile onto the cold, hard tiles barely three meters away from where Zhongli currently has one foot on the ground and Childe\u2019s undone fly in his face.\nNingguang coolly steps into the room and locks the door behind her. She turns around, critically eyes Childe and Zhongli who are frozen on the bed, and smirks. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe clown, as Childe finds out, is rabid.\nHe also finds out that said clown has a name, and he is called \u2018Xiao.\u2019\n\u201cHe is an old friend of mine,\u201d Zhongli explains to Childe with good cheer glowing all over his face. \u201cA very dear friend, who just so happens to work odd jobs every now and then. He was the one that carried you from the haunted house all the way to the medical bay.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 I see.\u201d\n\u201cSo, you\u2018re Zhongli\u2019s new boyfriend?\u201d Xiao crosses his arms, the smudged, gruesome makeup on his face doing nothing to mask his fearsome glare. The red that coats his nose is marred and uneven, and if Childe cranes his head a bit, he can spy a little of the same red powder sticking to Zhongli\u2019s fingers.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he replies stiffly. Xiao leans into his space, his clownish presence towering over Childe even though Childe\u2019s pretty sure that he would be a whole head taller than Xiao if it weren\u2019t for the stilts.\nZhongli is still smiling complacently and cluelessly off to the side as Xiao continues leaning in even further\u2014his afro wig brushing against Childe\u2019s forehead, his eyes wide like a gaping maw that devours the souls of unworthy men.\n\u201cYou break his heart,\u201d the clown breathes, lips barely moving, \u201cAnd  I break you.\u201d \nThis time, rather than passing out, Childe thinks that he might as well pass away instead.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nToe Knee Ah, Ajax Spray-n-Wipe\n\n\u00a0\n\n12:45pm\n\n\n my boyfriend agrees that hatsune miku is green \n\n\u00a0\n\n12:47pm\n\n\n ure both colourblind \n\n\n the whole family agrees that shes blue and \n\n\n12:48pm\n\n\n wait\u00a0 \n\n\n BOYFRIEND???? \n\n\n AJAX??????? \n\n\n HELLO \n\n\n HELLO \n\n\n WHAT \n\n\n SINCE WHEN DID U GRT A BOYFRIWND \n\n\nHEY DONT LEAVE ME ON READ \n\n\n IM TELLING OUR PARENTS \n\n\n AJAX \n\n\n CHILDE \n\n\n BIG BRO \n\n\n12:50pm\n\n\n HAMTARO KNOCKOFF \n\n\u00a0\n\n12:50pm\n\n\n CALL ME THAT ONE MORE TIME AND I WILL BLOCK YOU \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWere you ever going to tell me that apparently our cat is internet famous?\u201d Childe grumbles, dragging a brush through Morax\u2019s wet fur and easing out all the knots as gently as he can, lest he becomes the subject of a ruthless feline wrath.\nZhongli doesn\u2019t even bat an eyelash as he clips the cat\u2019s nails with surgical precision. \u201cIs he?\u201d\u00a0\nThe ginger huffs. \u201cOne million followers is a lot of people. I have, like, two hundred.\u201d\n\u201cYou have half a million on your \u2018Tweeter\u2019 account.\u201d Zhongli points out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s different. That\u2019s my old Tsaritsa stan account.\u201d\nZhongli looks up to give Childe a flat look. \u201cYet you never told me about it, so I saw no reason to inform you of Morax\u2019s SNS either. It\u2019s an equivalent exchange.\u201d\n \u201c\u2018Equivalent exchange\u2026\u2019\u2019' Childe  mutters under his breath, reaching for the hairdryer (the same one that blasted him into the mirror a few months ago) to dry out Morax\u2019s fur and make him the infamous fluffball that he\u2019s internationally known for. Because right now his fur simply hangs from his body like bits of soggy seaweed, lending Morax an exquisite look that\u2019s more akin to a deep sea horror rather than a mostly harmless, slightly obese brown-coloured blob, \u201c...my ass. I\u2019m still buying Mona bubble teas to this day.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d  Clip. Clip. Clip.  Childe can\u2019t even cut his  own nails as fast as Zhongli clips their cat\u2019s.\n\u201cNothing.\u201d He replies, watching the way coffee fur ripples under waves of heat as all the moisture is slowly vaporised from within. There\u2019s no way in hell he\u2019s telling Zhongli that this relationship is technically worth fifty-two (and counting) milk and fruit teas of varying and sometimes dubious flavours.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHere you go, your royal highness,\u201d Childe grins as he fixes a shiny plastic crown on top of Morax\u2019s head, earning a swat of annoyance from the cat. \u201cHow does it feel to get officially coronated as the king of the household?\u201d\nMorax shoots him a look that can be roughly translated as \u2018fuck off\u2019. Childe simply laughs in response.\n\u201cMaybe we should do something different, since having only Morax as the subject of every picture would become repetitive given enough time,\u201d Zhongli muses as he scratches the cat\u2019s chin. \u201cA family photo, perhaps?\u201d\nChilde raises his eyebrows to his hairline, before he lets out a huff of laughter. \u201cOkay. Sure, me, you, Morax\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd Roomba,\u201d Zhongli says seriously, plucking the vacuum off from the floor where it was in the middle of just trying to do its one job in the house. \u201cA family of four,\" he declares solemnly.\nChilde can only laugh resignedly at that before he holds Zhongli\u2019s phone against the light of the balcony to snap a candid photo with Morax batting at the crown on his head, Zhongli doing his best to keep said crown on Morax\u2019s head, and Roomba struggling in Zhongli\u2019s grasp with its wheels whirring against the air.\u00a0\nChilde hums as he slaps some flattering filters onto the photo before pressing his finger onto the \u2018post\u2019 icon without a single moment\u2019s hesitation, chuckling at the way Morax flicks his tail and ends up getting it caught in Roomba's wheels, screeching in pain while batting a confused Zhongli right in the face.\n\u00a0\nThe next morning, Zhongli wakes up to two million followers.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nOperation Spice Girls\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2740 Guizhong Ballista \u2740\n\n\n Ningguang you\u2019re a genius \n\n\n I can\u2019t believe that whole double date thing actually worked \n\n\u00a0\n\nNingguang (Do not contact me outside of work hours)\n\n\n It\u2019s also thanks to Zhongli suggesting that we visit the haunted house. \n\n\n You know what they say: when two people are placed in a perilous situation together, they will automatically feel a special connection. \n\n\n Although in retrospect, Zhongli did not seem to be in peril at all. \n\n\n And the connection didn\u2019t occur in the attraction itself, but rather the medical bay. \n\n\n But at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t matter as long as the goal is achieved. \n\n\u00a0\n\nKeqing.\n\n\n If we had just stayed quiet behind the door maybe it would have gone a lot smoother. \n\n\u00a0\nQueen MonAss \u2764\n\n WHO WAS THE ONE WHISPERING NOW KISS AND ACCIDENTALLY PUSHED THE DOOR OPEN\n\n\u00a0\n\nKeqing.\u00a0\n\n\n WHO WAS THE ONE WHO KEPT TUGGING MY HAIR HARD ENOUGH FOR ME TO FALL OVER AND KNOCK BEIDOU OUT ONTO THE GROUND.\n\n\u00a0\nQueen MonAss \u2764\n\n . \n\n\n Sorry \n\n\n Ill treat you to dinner \n\n\u00a0\n\nKeqing.\u00a0\n\n\n Don\u2019t force yourself, you still have to pay rent. My treat. \n\n\u00a0\nQueen MonAss \u2764\n\n I LOVE U \n\n\u00a0\n\nKeqing.\u00a0\n\n\n I love you too.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\nQueen MonAss \u2764\n\n We make a much better pair than Zhongli and stupid gingerhead right \n\n\u00a0\n\nAjax Spray-n-Wipe\n\n\n thats great and all that you made up after your fight that lasted a total of 2 seconds but you guys realise im still in the chat right \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSurprisingly (or unsurprisingly), being Zhongli\u2019s boyfriend is almost the exact same experience as being his roommate, that much is evident from the last few weeks they\u2019ve been together.\nOr, perhaps, there has always been an overlap between the two\u2014between all the cheeky bantering, splitting of the housework (a very uneven ratio, but the effort is there), quiet nights in front of the TV, and lazy morning hugs\u2014but Childe has always been too stubborn to call it otherwise.\nThe only thing that\u2019s changed, really, is that Zhongli is more open now. More heartfelt, genuine, maybe. It\u2019s a bit like watching the slow ascent of mountainous fog rising into the skies, unveiling the sublime sort of contentment of watching mountains swathed in the golden light of dawn.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI like your hands,\u201d Zhongli whispers to Childe one early morning, under the dim, artificial kitchen lights. \u201cI think they\u2019re beautiful.\u201d\nHe trances a finger over an old laceration, almost as if deep in thought. His own hands are smooth in comparison, long and well-kept, the only visible imperfection a writer\u2019s callus on the side of the middle finger, but even then, it blends in well.\n\u201cI think  you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Childe grins, breathless, a warm flush creeping up his neck, hands limp in the other\u2019s grasp. Zhongli\u2019s eyes go wide for a second, before a smile blooms across his face, soft and luminescent. Childe decides that not even the dazzling alpines of northern Snezhnaya could rival such a gorgeous sight.\n\u201cI think you\u2019re beautiful too,\u201d Zhongli tells him, honeyed eyes crinkling with delight as he weaves their fingers together, firm, unabashed, like they were always meant to be, and slots their lips together as morning sunlight seeps into the room.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(epilogue.)\n\u00a0\nHavria keeps her promise, and organises a group video call as soon as she lands safely in her new country. Guizhong, Childe and Zhongli all watch with varying degrees of concentration as Havria tours them through downtown Fontaine, the potent combination of lag and constant movement rendering the video feed jumpy and unclear.\u00a0\nGuizhong is currently backseat driving Havria around to each of the shops\u2014commenting on everything from local fashion to delicacies to the Fontainean government\u2019s military budget\u2014while Childe is on the couch with Zhongli, sitting cross legged as the other man huddles against his shoulder, muffling a tired yawn into the back of his hand. As it seems, the timezone difference between Fontaine and Liyue means that what is three in the afternoon for Havria ends up being five in the morning for the rest of them.\n\u201cMmh\u2026\u201d the brunette mumbles, eyes flickering unsteadily as he tries his best to focus on Childe\u2019s phone. The younger breathes out a chuckle, wrapping an arm around Zhongli\u2019s shoulders to hold him closer as they let the two womens\u2019 voices wash over them like familiar white noise.\n \u201cZhongli!!\u201d  Guizhong suddenly presses her face so close into the camera that a single eyebrow takes up the entire space of the little rectangle.  \u201cYou know how to speak Fontainean, right? How do you say \u2018your taste in souvenirs suck and a baguette is not an acceptable gift to someone who you\u2019ve known for more than twenty years\u2019?\u201d \n\u201cJ'ai besoin de nouveaux amis,\u201d Zhongli replies, before shimmying down until only half his face is left uncovered by the blanket, resting his head on Childe\u2019s broad chest and closes his eyes, letting the other man\u2019s faint heartbeat lull him into a state of peaceful zen.\nChilde laughs, indulgent, combing his fingers through his boyfriend\u2019s fluffy hair in a mirroring motion to how he would comb Morax\u2019s scraggly fur after a bath.\nHavria\u2019s camera is still a blurry mess, but at least it\u2019s now stable enough to no longer induce motion sickness. Guizhong leans back so most of her face is visible again, lips pursed in thought.\n \u201c\u2018J'ai besoin de nouveaux amis\u2019,\u201d  she tests, satisfied, and grins. \u201cNot bad! Hey Havria, \u2018j'ai besoin de nouveaux amis\u2019!\u201d \n\u00a0\n(fin.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
