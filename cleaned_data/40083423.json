    "text": "\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Place Beyond the Quarry is the follow up to the Shotguns\u2019s critically acclaimed sophomore album, the Grammy-nominated METALHEAD. Unlike their first album \u2014 a metal inspired grunge album with influences from Led Zeppelin, T.Rex, and Metallica alike, with soaring vocals and surprisingly delicate, thoughtful musical digressions \u2014 or the aforementioned METALHEAD \u2014 which leaned further into both the sounds of metal and Ed Levy\u2019s distinctive lyrical stylings \u2014 The Place Beyond the Quarry is more interested in story-telling and risk-taking. I tell him so right before we sit down, that that is what I want to talk about today.\n\u201cI\u2019m into that. I\u2019m not, like, invested in creating a certain sound and sticking to it,\u201d Levy says. \u201cSure, there\u2019s comfort in it  \u2014  you keep your core fans that way, you know?  \u2014  but I wanna explore. I wanna do interesting things, and I thought it\u2019d be fun to take a whole album and tell a certain story.\u201d\nLike a concept album?\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d He shakes his head, lights up a cigarette after asking if I mind. I don\u2019t, but he still carefully blows the smoke away from me as he continues, \u201cIt\u2019s just a story. A ghost story, maybe, a horror story, definitely. A failed love story. I want  \u2014  something I want, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done it here, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready yet, but something I want to get close to  \u2014  that risk-taking  \u2014  is kind of cracking myself open. Showing myself, as I am. I think I get close.\u201d\nHe pauses then, stares out the window, contemplative. He repeats, \u201cRisk-taking. Risk. Hmm. Yeah. I suppose that\u2019s one word for it.\u201d\n\u2014 Excerpted from \u201cFable, Legend, or Horror Story: Ed Levy Talks a Place Beyond the Quarry,\u201d NME, August 1994\n\n\n\n\nSixteen years after the world didn't end for the last time, Max Mayfield showed up on Steve\u2019s doorstep and said, \u201cYou gonna walk me down the aisle in May or what?\u201d It\u2019s not really a question.\nIt was January, the new semester just starting, and it was sleeting like a son of a bitch on the South Side of Chicago. Steve had been living in the same loft space in a converted warehouse since he\u2019d moved to Chicago, back in \u201894 when he\u2019d succumbed to the final round of educational bullying from Nancy and Robin and found himself accepted to Chicago State, pursuing a Master\u2019s in School Counseling. Like a lot of things, he\u2019d fallen into his career and, against all reason and historical evidence, he was actually a damned good guidance counselor. Maybe it was all the experience from babysitting the Party and saving the world, he\u2019d think and then laugh quietly to himself.\nBut good at it he was, and he was also good at his side gig at the school he worked at as the coach of the boy\u2019s basketball team. The team itself wasn\u2019t anything to write home about \u2014 they hadn\u2019t yet made it past the first round of States but they had a lot of heart and grit and a few of his kids had been scouted over the last five years that he\u2019d been coaching. He had a good feeling about this season though, and so had his kids, putting up with him running them ragged near daily in the paint, encouraged because he always ran himself ragged right next to them.\nEven if, he thought, they mainly just enjoyed ragging on him afterwards for how deflated his still-signature hair got.\nHe\u2019d, in fact, just been there, at the high school gym, critiquing free-throws and putting in wind sprints to groans and good-natured but still foul teenage expletives, before sending them all home for the afternoon and packing himself up as well. It hadn\u2019t been weathering yet, when he\u2019d hopped onto the 9, but it had started soon after and he\u2019d had to carefully jog through the slush and sleet for the final ten minute leg of his journey home.\nHe\u2019d just finished his usual post-work out routine \u2014 protein shake and a handful of Nilla wafers, then a five minute shower followed by twenty-minutes of sitting at the bottom of the shower dissociating \u2014 and was trying to decide if he felt like cooking or if he just wanted to order some take-out when his doorbell rang.\nBrow furrowed, Steve had made his way to his door, wondering if one of the neighbors had gotten locked out or someone else\u2019s dinner was on his doorstep only to find one of his once-wayward charges. Max stared out at him from a parka that probably weighed more than she did, pale face a wind chapped red and furious about it. She\u2019d never gotten used to a midwestern winter and had hightailed it back to Cali after graduation to study at UC Santa Barbara, Lucas trailing in her wake with a athletic scholarship further south at San Diego State. They were both in L.A. these days, Max working as a children\u2019s therapist and Lucas a point guard with the Clippers.\nThey stared at each other for a long moment, Max frowning grumpily and Steve trying to remember if he wholly blacked out on a phone call. He knew the Clippers were in an away loop, because they had a game in Milwaukee coming up that he\u2019d wanted to go to but couldn\u2019t because it was a Tuesday, and Max usually didn\u2019t travel with Lucas, too busy with her practice, but maybe she had this time, and Steve totally forgot about dinner plans, but then she had ambushed with with that walking down the aisle business and \u2014\nMax cracked him right on the shin with her cane. \u201cMother fucker, you gonna let me in or what? It might be warm in this hallway but I\u2019ve been freezing my tits off for the past hour and a half getting here from O\u2019Hare and my hip is goddamn  killing  me.\u201d\nSteve blinked and stepped aside. \u201cDid I forget about a visit?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d She shouldered past him, pulling her parka off and tossing it over his coat rack. \u201cThis is an ambush.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. That was on brand. \u201cGo sit on the couch before you fall down and break another hip, grandma. You want coffee? I got a hot water bottle I can warm up too.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d Max said. \u201cBoth, please.\u201d\nHe put on his kettle first, and then started up his Mr Coffee as he went. He shot a look over his shoulder at Max, who was making herself comfortable on the Ikea sofa he\u2019d let Robin pick out last summer when she was visiting, replacing the old shit-kicker he\u2019d inherited from Joyce and Hopper when he\u2019d first moved in.\n\u201cFood too?\u201d he called over his shoulder.\n\u201cI could eat,\u201d she hollered back.\n\u201cPizza?\u201d\n\u201cYes. The shit in LA is an abomination.\u201d\nSteve picked up the landline in the kitchen and dialed his local place, putting his regular order in plus an extra round of garlic knots, while he kept one eye on the stove and the other on the Mr Coffee. In a matter of minutes, he had all three tasks done and he was joining Max on the couch with two mugs of coffee in his hands and the water bottle tucked under his arm.\nShe liberated the bottle immediately, setting it under her left hip, and then took hold of her coffee mug. Steve had given her one of the novelty mugs Dustin had gotten for him over the years that announced he\u2019s gotten lei\u2019d in Honolulu; he had poured his coffee into his personal favorite mug from that collection, one that read World\u2019s Okayest Dad. Max snorted as she read it.\n\u201cHow\u2019s the practice?\u201d he asked, settling back into the cushions.\n\u201cNormal,\u201d she said. \u201cHad to call CPS the other day, did I tell you?\u201d\n\u201cYou mentioned you had some concerns,\u201d Steve said.\nOf all the kids, Steve stayed most in touch with Max. Dustin and Lucas were always on the go \u2014 Lucas, of course, traveling with his team and Dustin had ended up working for Industrial Light and Magic (and hadn\u2019t that been a phone call that nearly blew Steve\u2019s eardrums out) and was always on some movie set or another \u2014 and Will called fairly from NYC regularly to talk but god help him if he was approaching a deadline from his editor. Meanwhile, Mike and El ran a bed and breakfast in upstate New York and often were pretty busy being a couple of granola weirdos with chickens, living off the grid; Mike would occasionally call but El preferred to send him letters.\nMax and him had similar professional interests though, working with kids, even if they were two totally different careers. They would send each other scholarly articles about counseling and early education development and any interesting papers they may have read lately; they\u2019d bounce ideas off each other, ask for advice if they had a particularly difficult kid in their care at the moment while still protecting privacy and abiding by doctor-patient confidentiality. They emailed at least twice a week, and regularly talk on the phone, schedules and time zones allowing.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she was saying. \u201cIt was pretty ugly, in the end. I was hoping I wouldn\u2019t have to get them involved but \u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you made the right call,\u201d he told her.\n\u201cOh, I did,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just \u2014 you know. You never want that.\u201d\nSteve squeezed her shoulder once. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cHow are your kids? Darlene still having a normal one?\u201d\n\u201cAlways,\u201d he said with a snort. \u201cPretty sure she\u2019ll be in my office at  least  four times next week, in a full panic about something. Totally reminds me of Dustin at that age, going on about the same shit. Poor kid.\u201d\n\u201cYou tell her not getting into college isn\u2019t the end of the world?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cEvery damn time,\u201d Steve said. \u201cEven told her I didn\u2019t go until I was twenty-three, but honestly I think that freaked her out more. Kid\u2019s an absolute genius, there is no way she  isn\u2019t  getting into every one of her top schools, but you can\u2019t reason with anxiety.\u201d\nThe doorbell rang then, and it was the kid from his local place with his order. He tipped generously for coming out in the weather, and set the boxes on his coffee table. He popped back into the kitchen to ditch their coffee mugs and grab them each a Peroni, even though it still felt weird to offer any of the kids something alcoholic.\nThey each got through a slice before Steve took a swig of his beer and said, \u201cSo, about me walking you down the aisle.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about it,\u201d Max said around a mouthful of pepperoni. \u201cIt\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t even gotten a save the date yet or whatever,\u201d he said.\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat do you think this conversation is, Harrington?\u201d\nHe rolled his eyes right back.\n\u201cMay fourth, it\u2019s a Saturday, gonna be up in Santa Rosa,\u201d she said. \u201cWine country. We booked this vineyard for the ceremony, there\u2019s a damn wine cave for the after party.\u201d\n\u201cThat confident Lucas isn\u2019t making the playoffs this year?\u201d\n\u201cThe Clippers blow,\u201d said Max, pulling approximately zero punches, as always, and like she wasn\u2019t wearing a Clipper scarf on the way in, \u201cso, yeah, no, I think we\u2019re good for the date, even be able to invite the whole team.\u201d\nThe Clippers, Steve reflected, did in fact blow this year. They weren\u2019t his team \u2014 go Pacers and occasionally the Bulls \u2014 but he kept an eye on their standings to support Lucas, and they were four L\u2019s in a row at the moment, though the last one was in OT. It would take an actually miracle to get them beyond April that year, which Max clearly wasn\u2019t betting on.\n\u201cWell, then as your father,\u201d he started.\n\u201cGross,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAs your father,\u201d he said, \u201cdo I get to bring a date to this thing?\u201d\nShe waved her slice of pizza at him. \u201cRobin\u2019s already gonna be there.\u201d\n\u201cDid you invite Robin before you invited me?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel about that.\u201d\nMax rolled her eyes again. Steve had given up years ago trying to tell her they\u2019d stick like that. She may have been the kid he was closest to these days, but she was also the one who respected him the least. He wondered if that said anything about him, and promptly shoved that thought into the back of his mind of interrogate at the later date of  fucking never.\n\u201cI asked her to put that fancy Fine Arts BA to work and make the invites,\u201d she was telling him. \u201cOf course she knows when the date is before you. She knew the date before anyone besides me and Lucas, and, like, Lucas\u2019s agent.\u201d\n\u201cKeeping it in the family, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he said. \u201cRobin with the invites, me walking you down the aisle.\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Max. She picked a few pieces of pepperoni off her slice, ate them one at a time. She said, off hand, \u201cWe actually asked Eddie to officiate. Lucas talked him into it a while back, actually, so he planned his current European tour around it, and will be back in the states by then. We haven\u2019t seen him since Will\u2019s book signing last year, he\u2019s really excited to see everyone again.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d He shoved a garlic knot in his mouth. \u201cSo I\u2019m third to get invited?\u201d\n\u201cSeventh,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, maybe not. Eighth? Ninth? I told El after we asked Eddie, and Lucas told Mike and Dustin and Will, and I bet they told Jonathan and Nancy.\u201d\nSteve snorted. \u201cYou sure know how to make a boy feel special.\u201d\nMax smirked around the neck of her Peroni and jabbed Steve in the ribs with her elbow, still as fucking pointy as they were when her head barely went past his waist.\nWhile Steve proclaimed that he loved all his children equally, albeit differently, sometimes he thought if someone put a gun to his head and asked his favorite, it might be Max. Lucas liked to lord the fact that he took most after Steve over the rest \u2014  jocks,  Mike always hissed derogatorily, even while smirking; Dustin was the closest thing to a brother Steve had ever had in his life; Mike was an absolute shitbird but well-meaning and he\u2019d be the first to call Steve these days asking for advice; and Will and El were just angels here on Earth and they\u2019d never done anything wrong in their lives, as far as Steve was concerned.\nBut Max was a miracle, an honest to god miracle. She\u2019d spent a month in that hospital bed, unaware, Steve by her side more than not, with Joyce and Hopper too, because Max\u2019s mom couldn\u2019t handle it. Hopper had been the one to lie to the nurses, say Steve was Max\u2019s older brother, and maybe it had been Joyce in tandem with Murray but then there were papers that said so too, gave Steve power of attorney and it had choked him right up, wrapped a fist around his heart and tightened like a vice. Steve had kept her hair in plaits, taught El to do the same, helped the nurses with her PT, read her books well into the night.\nHe\u2019d only left her side when Joyce kicked him out, and even then he never went far. He\u2019d go home to shower and sleep, sure, but Eddie was two hospital rooms down, in his own medically induced coma with his uncle at his side while they waited for him to stabilize enough to get a kidney transplant from Mike, of all people, who turned out to be a match.\u00a0\nSteve had haunted that hospital like a ghost until Eddie woke and got whisked away by the feds, and until Max woke up too, and they saved the world again, Vecna Part Two: Electric Boogaloo or whatever.\nThese days, her remembrance from Vecna was a cane on a good day, and a wheelchair on the bad ones. She had difficulty with fine motor control too, relied on a dictaphone for her session notes with her patients. The screaming nightmares, she assured, were few and far between now, and Steve believed her, only because his nightmares were too.\nHaving her here, sat across from him, it was a miracle none of them thought they would get, and the Steve of the spring of 1986 wouldn\u2019t have even been able to fathom this conversation on his couch. His girl was getting married \u2014 his girl was alive and whole enough to get married, and she was asking him to walk her down the aisle.\n\u201cSorry I didn\u2019t ask you first,\u201d she told him, picking shakily at the label of her beer. Steve couldn\u2019t look away from the tiny motions of her fingers as she spoke. \u201cI mean, if you\u2019re really sore about it. I suppose I just \u2014 you know, the day Lucas proposed to me, back when we were eighteen \u2014 when we were kids \u2014 I wasn\u2019t ready back then, you know that, and neither was he. We\u2019d been through so much, and I didn\u2019t know if we knew who we were without that. We had a lot of living we needed to do, normal living, and so we decided to wait until I was finished with school, and then Lucas was getting drafted and I was getting my masters and you know I never thought marriage was a thing I\u2019d want, not really. I\u2019d seen seen all these terrible marriages, all my life, and I thought: who could possibly want that? Why would you want to put yourself through that? It seemed like a fucking tax scam, and maybe I still think that, maybe it really is, but even when I thought that, even then \u2014 the only two things I knew for certain was if I did get married, if I changed my mind, if I thought, fuck it, why not \u2014 I knew that it\u2019d be to Lucas and I knew that I\u2019d want you next to me when I did it.\u201d\nSteve looked out the window. He rubbed a hand across his mouth.\n\u201cAre you crying?\u201d demanded Max. \u201cYou\u2019re crying, ugh, don\u2019t make it  weird, old man.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not crying, you\u2019re crying,\u201d he said, shifting to wrap one around her thin shoulders. He dropped a kiss onto her hair while she pretended to gag.\u00a0\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll do it?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d he told her, squeezing her shoulders once and releasing her. He stood and went to the kitchen to grab them two more beers; they\u2019d earned it. \u201cAlright, so, now that is out of the way or whatever \u2014 did you come here with any other plans? Or did you just think you\u2019d ambush me emotionally and then rely upon the goodness of my heart and the softness of this Ikea sofa?\u201d\n\u201cBitch, I am not sleeping on the sofa,\u201d she said as he dropped back down next to her. \u201cI\u2019m crippled, I get your bed \u2014  you  get the sofa.\"\nSteve shook his head. \u201cYeah, that tracks. You want me to see if I can find the Clipper\u2019s game?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, those losers?\u201d She kicked up her feet into Steve\u2019s lap. \u201cSure. Whatever you want.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2026  Girl with a Buzzcut  , the titular song of the album. It starts slow, a gentle warm up of guitar and soft lyrics, before bursting into something hard and fast; it slows again just as quickly. Levy repeats the move several times, easing the listener into the story of a fierce creature with her hair shorn to her scalp and the place she\u2019s looking to burn to the ground for its trespasses against her, building the rhythm and melody as the Girl\u2019s rage builds. Levy\u2019s lyrics paint a stark picture of the girl, someone he clearly respects and admires for her ferocity; it\u2019s a stark juxtaposition to the last song on the album, which is a sort of bittersweet ode to a small-town cheerleader who finds herself in trouble and doesn\u2019t know how to get out  \u2014  a story that is more universal than the apparent monster killer of the Girl\u2026\n\u2014  Excerpted from \u201cSeattle\u2019s Own The Shotguns Drop First Full Album,\u201d The Rocket, April 1990 \n\n\n\n\nSteve had just shooed his last student of the day out of his office \u2014 Darlene Johnston, of course, having yet another crisis about her college application process because she hadn\u2019t yet heard back from her two early action schools, and Steve had to talk her off the ledge, because the kid was top of her class and was surely going to get into all of the schools she was applying to  \u2014  when someone knocked as he was packing up to get ready to head to the gym.\nHe looked up, ready to neatly dispatch whatever student needed his attention, and nearly sighed in relief when he saw who it was.\nMadchen Fraser was Steve\u2019s best friend at Whitney. The sophomore English teacher and girls\u2019 basketball coach, she was a weird little goth trapped in the body of a beautiful jock, six foot two and violently blonde and honest to god movie-star gorgeous, with the meanest three-point lay-up he\u2019d seen outside the pros, and Steve had once personally watched her make Mr Griswald who taught AP chem cry using only her words. He kind of dreaded the day she inevitably met anyone from Hawkins in person; he would never know peace after.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHey. You getting ready to head to the gym?\u201d she asked.\nHe nodded, locking his filing cabinet and standing to move out from behind his desk. \u201cYeah. You?\u201d\n\u201cYup,\u201d Madchen said. \u201cWalk with me?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\nShe stepped backward into the hall so Steve could look his door, and he fell into step with her, the clicking of her heels  \u2014  which lifted her even taller, something Steve knew she did because she loved making people uncomfortable  \u2014  the only sound for a moment. Last bell hadn\u2019t rung yet, so they were alone in the halls.\n\u201cHow are classes?\u201d he asked. He hadn\u2019t had much time to catch up with Madchen since they\u2019d come back from winter break: he had all the home games while she\u2019d been out on the aways with the girls lately, and they were on opposite lunch periods that semester to boot, which had always been their normal catch up time outside of practices.\n\u201cEh,\u201d she said. \u201cWe finished  Up from Slavery  right before the break, and I decided to make them all read  On Civil Disobedience  next this year so I\u2019m expecting to get called to the superintendent\u2019s office any day now.\u201d\nSteve snorted. \u201cLast year\u2019s Slaughterhouse-Five inspired riot wasn\u2019t good enough for you?\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all, it wasn\u2019t a riot,\u201d she said, \u201cit was a small, erm, protest against the Gulf War and I gave a coerecided apology to the Board for that. You were there.\u201d\nHe was. He\u2019d been proud of those kids too. Still, he shook his head and told her, \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky you haven\u2019t been fired.\u201d\n\u201cI thought we wanted to educate the youth and create free thinkers, not little automatons who don\u2019t question the status quo.\u201d Madchen shrugged. \u201cWhatever, I\u2019ll keep shaping the minds of tomorrow as I see fit and if they wanna fire me, fire me. What was that you said once? I\u2019m not keeping any curiosity doors shut for these kids.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d He snorted again. He\u2019d gotten that from Dustin, a million years ago, and it was surprisingly applicable for so many situations in his life and career. \u201cI did say that.\u201d\nThey were at the gym by then, just a few minutes before the final bell of the day rang and Steve\u2019s boys went to the weight room while Madchen\u2019s girls had the court.\n\u201cYou wanna stick around after practice?\u201d she was asking. \u201cPlay a little horse, blow off some steam.\u201d\n\u201cYou just wanna take me to school out there,\u201d he said, pointing.\u00a0\n\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very funny to me.\u201d\n\u201cFuck it, why not.\u201d\nThey separated, going to their respective practices, and, as promised, Steve headed to the court after. A couple of each of their teams hung around on the bleachers, too, heckling as Madchen absolutely whipped his ass at horse. It was, of course, par for the course: back when she was a teen and a head taller than most of the other girls in her grade, Madchen had been scouted for the US National Team. The only reason she hadn\u2019t ended up in the pros was because she\u2019d been in a bad car accident that had derailed her young career and, after, had decided she\u2019d rather go to school and become a teacher instead.\nAfter two rounds of fully getting his ass handed to him, and smack talk coming from all directions, he and Madchen started cleaning up the court for the evening. Their kids headed out, waving as they went, and the two of them sat down on the bleachers, trading a water bottle back and forth between them.\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve got this wedding in May,\u201d he told her. \u201cCouple of the kids I used to babysit are getting married finally \u2014 you know, the therapist and the kid on the Clipper\u2019s I\u2019ve told you about?\u201d\n\u201cThe point guard,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cHe should really talk to his agent about a trade, he\u2019s wasted.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Steve nodded too, lifting his shirt to wipe some sweat off his brow. \u201cBut Max\u2019s practice is in LA and they both like it there, so I don\u2019t think he\u2019d move unless it was for the Lakers, or even Golden State.\u201d\nMadchen made a face at the mention of Golden State; she was a Boston girl, through and through.\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d he continued. \u201cMax is like my kid sister, I guess, and her dad\u2019s been out of the picture for a while and her mom \u2014 she basically threatened to kneecap me if I didn\u2019t walk her down the aisle, and like I would\u2019ve said yes anyway, but she\u2019s about ten pounds of whoopass in a five pound bag, so.\u201d\n\u201cI really gotta meet these kids someday,\u201d she said, snorting. \u201cThey sound like they were raised by wolves, and you know I love that in a kid.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t even know the half of it, his little feral weirdos. \u201cThey\u2019re all like thirty these days, but we could totally make that happen. You maybe wanna come? I get a date.\u201d\nFor a second, she side-eyed him over the Gatorade-branded water bottle. He waved a hand at her. \u201cNot as, like, a date-date.\u201d\nSteve, it should be said, had realized he had some very specific criteria for his close female friends. He didn\u2019t think Joyce counted, because when he was being honest with himself he could admit he thought of her as his mom more than his own biological one, but the other women in his life? They were either lesbians, ex-girlfriends who he saved the world with, or something little sister adjacent \u2014 or, on occasion, an unholy combination of all three.\nMadchen clocked in at two and a half of the three. They didn\u2019t save the world together, but they\u2019d gone on approximately one date together because they were peer-pressured into it when Steve started at the school \u2014 apparently, they were contractually obligated to given that they were both \u2018ballers \u2014 and when they decided they were better off as friends, they\u2019d slipped into friendly, sibling-like camaraderie, horse related ass-kickings and all.\nThey\u2019d also discovered they shared another important trait through their friendship: they were both bi, and while Madchen was self-professed to always being female-leaning on the spectrum, Steve these days found himself more male leaning.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got this cute lesbian I\u2019ve been meaning to introduce you to,\u201d he said, because, yeah, he knew he was setting himself up for a lifetime of getting his shit torpedoed on a regular basis but Robin and Madchen? He knew without a shadow of a doubt the two of them were going to hit it off, end up in gay love, move in two months into dating, and adopt something like twelve cats together.\u00a0\nThe things he did for his friends, he thought, watching as Madchen\u2019s stared, narrow-eyed, at him as she thought.\n\u201cHow cute,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSo cute,\u201d he told her. \u201cArt historian in Boston, ex-band nerd, half a foot shorter than you, practically a pocket person.\u201d\n\u201cSold,\u201d Madchen said. \u201cI mean, I was gonna sign up anyway because I figured I\u2019d finally get to meet all of those weirdos you call your children. A cute lesbian is just a bonus.\u201d\n\u201cThe gang will all be there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m walking Max down the aisle, and El and Robin \u2014 that\u2019s our girl \u2014 are gonna stand with her, and the boys will all be there with Lucas. My, like, adopted parents will be there too, and my kind of step-brother and his wife. Our friend Eddie is apparently officiating. Probably also like half the Clippers. Other people, probably \u2014\u201d\n\u201cEddie,\u201d said Madchen, slowly. Her eyes had narrowed again. \u201cYou\u2019ve talked about him before.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Steve, cautiously.\n\u201cThe rockstar,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMetalhead,\u201d he corrected. \u201cThe Shotguns, that\u2019s his thing.\u201d\n\u201cThe Shotguns. Huh.\u201d She stared into the middle distance for a moment and Steve, suddenly, realized that something was at work behind Madchen\u2019s eyes and he felt a sort of dread rise in his chest.\nMadchen Fraser was perceptive, was the thing. He loved that about her. It was what made her such an insightful teacher, a brilliant essayist, a great coach. She was mean and fucking smart and there was a reason she was basically the head of the English department at Whitney despite only being thirty-three. She had a great memory, an excellent attention to detail, and was an avid reader of Rolling Stone. He watched, then, as Madchen\u2019s mind started to work at the problem, as she weighed evidence from their five year friendship, as she recalled conversations they\u2019ve had and things Steve had said over the years about, the one off-hand reference he\u2019d made to a love affair that never even got off the ground because he was too much of a chickenshit to \u2014\nHe could see her picturing the guys he\u2019d hooked up with in the dark corners of the gay bars when they\u2019d hit the town together, the one serious boyfriend he\u2019d had since they\u2019d known each other, the one serious girlfriend. He could practically see her picturing the December \u201898 cover of Rolling Stone in her mind\u2019s eye.\nHe\u2019d avoided this conversation with Madchen for five years; she hadn\u2019t even known it was a conversation they could have. He\u2019d successfully avoided this conversation with the people who knew him best for even longer.\nBut \u2014\nFuck, thought Steve.\n\u201cThis is the guy you were in love with in high school, right?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr, like, right after? The one you fucked it up with.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t fuck anything up,\u201d he said.\nMadchen stared.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t! I just \u2014\u201d\nThe thing was: he didn\u2019t do  anything.\nAfter Eddie woke up, staples in his stomach, several pints of other\u2019s people blood in his veins, and Mike\u2019s kidney replacing the one that demobats tore out of him, the feds had whisked him away. There hadn\u2019t been a clear way to fix the damage Vecna had done to Eddie\u2019s name and so it had been a sort of witness protection situation that was decided on in the end: Eddie and his uncle had gotten a new last name and a new home all the way out in Pittsburgh, Ed Levy born out of the ashes of Eddie Munson. And, sure, he\u2019d stayed in touch, with Dustin and Mike, mostly, and Robin and Steve some too, the occasional phone call; and, sure, he had seemed more than happy to leave Hawkins in the rear view. But he\u2019d peeled back into town in a cloud of smoke and burning rubber during that final showdown in the Upside Down when they\u2019d called all the same, quite literally crashing his government-issued \u201878 Datsun 620 into the final big bad in the process, sending the damn thing spinning through the air in a manner that could only be described as slapstick.\nAfter, Steve could feel this unspoken  thing, between them, an unspoken  thing  with a capital-t, and they never talked about it. Not in person, not on the phone, not to other people. And they never acted on anything \u2014 the Steve of \u201886 barely had the vocabulary to even  acknowledge  that he felt something, let alone put  words  to it. And, sure, before and after, they\u2019d been pulled to each other, like orbiting planets, inextricable \u2014\nBut Eddie was there, and then he was gone, and then he was there again but he\u2019d never be  there  again, and Steve \u2014\nHe was \u2014\nSteve was fucking scared, okay, of what it meant, of what it was, and it wasn\u2019t like Steve could go anywhere back then, not before the end, not before he knew it was over, not before everything was in the fucking ground where it belonged. This was his town, and his kids, and he had to protect them; it was the only thing he\u2019d ever been good at and, even then, sometimes he thought he wasn\u2019t all that good at it to begin with.\nAnd even when it was \u2014 even when the dust settled and the skies were blue again \u2014 even when El swore up and down and until she was blue that nothing was ever,  ever  going to happen again \u2014 she\u2019d collapsed it, she\u2019d imploded it, sealed it within itself and tossed the key into the fires of Mordor or whatever \u2014\nEven then, it had still taken the collective powers of Hopper, Joyce, and Robin to convince Steve that there was something beyond Hawkins for him. That there was a life for him to be lived that wasn\u2019t the kids and monsters and a place beyond the quarry.\nRobin had joined forces with Nancy and Jonathan and Dustin, that punk shithead, to submit applications to local Indiana colleges behind his back; and Steve, somehow, found himself accepted to not one, not two, but three of them. He got out; he might\u2019ve been the last of them, the last one out, even after the end. But he got out all the same.\nIt was just that it was too late, for the secret he kept in the dark shadows of his heart. It was 1989 by then, and Eddie was in Seattle at that point, deep in a developing grunge scene and putting the finishing touches on an EP that sometimes he played snatches from over the phone to Steve, while Steve was in Terre Haute, struggling though his BA in Elementary Education. How could someone so insignificant as Steve Harrington, he of the 2.1 GPA, reformed bully, world\u2019s okayest dad \u2014 how could Steve mean anything to Eddie, putting out his first full album and then his second, two Grammy nominations coming down the pipeline?\u00a0\nEddie was a rockstar, four albums, five, and Steve was some jumped up white boy in inner city Chicago trying to make a difference while Eddie was spread out on the cover of Rolling Stone, crooked smile and eyeliner, a Megadeth t-shirt riding up his stomach to show off the tattoos he got to cover up all those demobats bites. Steve just had scars that he didn\u2019t talk about.\nAnd, sure, they ran into each other all the time, this event for one of the kids or that, called and wrote letters and emailed \u2014 sure, they went to the same weddings and parties and anniversaries, mourned the same things, were haunted by the same things \u2014 sure, sometimes Steve felt Eddie\u2019s eyes from across the room \u2014 sure, sometimes Steve had to look away \u2014\nIt was just too late. It was okay. It was fine. Sometimes, no matter how bad you wanted something, it didn\u2019t work out. He was happy with them as friends. Some things weren\u2019t meant to be.\nLots of people, he thought, had regrets. It didn\u2019t make him special.\nMadchen was still staring at him.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t fuck anything up,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIt just \u2014 it never worked out. It\u2019s fine, I promise.\u201d\nHe takes me down to Pike Place, after he learns I\u2019ve never been. He insists he needs to take me to his favorite bakery there, a Russian place called Piroshky Piroshky, and loudly extolls the virtues of a cinnamon cardamom pastry that he can\u2019t get enough of when he\u2019s in town.\nYears ago, when Ed Levy burst onto the Seattle scene as one of the early pioneers of the grunge music scene, he was often described as a stripped wire: electric and anxious as equal turns, but bright, energetic, magnetic. Many of his early comparisons were to Marc Bolan of T.Rex which, in his words, was \u201call because of the hair.\u201d But it was also the way he commanded the stage, strutting back and forth, winking at his audience, bouncing from one edge of whatever venue he was in to the next, the showmanship, the craft behind the manic energy.\nThese days, there\u2019s a quieter, more contemplative Levy on stage. After the release of  i\u2019m not angry anymore  \u2014 heralded as the most mature of his works \u2014 he\u2019s been doing several shows at The Crocodile, lo-fi and unplugged, just Levy and his guitar. I had the pleasure of attending last night\u2019s show and seeing that version of Levy on stage.\n\u2014  Excerpted from \u201cWhen the Levy Breaks,\u201d Rolling Stone, December 1998 \n\n\n\n\nLate winter turned to early spring in Chicago, remaining stubbornly, bitterly cold as always. Despite his best hopes, Steve\u2019s boys didn\u2019t make it to States; Madchen\u2019s girls did, but didn't make it out of the first round. Still, he and Madchen threw a party for the seniors on their teams like they took it all home; one of Steve\u2019s boys had gotten scouted at the very end, got a full ride to USC, and two of Madchen\u2019s girls were going to Auburn. Madchen\u2019s sophomores staged a sit-in back in February over the invasion of Iraq but that was a better received radicalization than last year's actual riot, no matter the revisionist history Madchen had about that. Steve\u2019s favorite neurotic mess of a student, Darlene, officially accepted her offer to Northwestern. It was wrapping up to be a pretty successful semester, and school year.\nIn the first week of May, on a Thursday, Steve and Madchen caught an early morning flight to Northern California. While both of them had been to California for one reason or another over the years, they hadn\u2019t spent much time in wine country. They did a little sightseeing as soon as they landed, and then met up for dinner with the Hopper-Byers clan.\nAfter Nancy had graduated with honors at Emerson, she\u2019d gone to J-School at Harvard. Jonathan had followed her to Boston but ultimately decided he didn\u2019t want to pursue a degree and went straight into working as a photojournalist, first just interning at the Globe and then actually working there. They\u2019d moved to San Francisco after Nancy had finished school and that was where they were now, Nancy working at a small but well respected independent newspaper as their editor-in-chief and Jonathan as a part-time freelance photographer. They had two adorable rugrats, an absolute fucking pistol of a six year old named Barbie who Steve would commit any number of crimes for, and a shy four year old named Scott, which Steve would also go to jail for, no questions asked.\nJoyce and Hopper were the only ones of them all who had stayed in Indiana, though they\u2019d moved away from Hawkins, bought and renovated an old dairy farm on the border of Kentucky. They\u2019d gotten quite a bit of government hush money, themselves, so Joyce only needed to work part-time at a local pharmacy to keep busy and Hopper \u2014\nIn 1992, Steve got a call from Jonathan at nine pm; it was a Tuesday, in April, and the moment was burned into his memory. Hopper had found a strange lump along his jawline and had gone in to check it out a few weeks prior, and after several biopsies and exhaustive rounds of testing, the doctors finally had a diagnosis: adenoid cystic carcinoma. He was scheduled for surgery, and then radiation, the next week, and the doctors were convinced that they\u2019d caught it early enough. They hadn\u2019t.\nA bout with testicular cancer came two years after that; he handled his subsequent surgery and chemo with predictably bad grace, and refused to quit smoking, even though Steve, Eddie, and Joyce all quit in solidarity with him. He spent three years in remission, and then they found the tumor on his back and he sat through another six months of radiation. It went like that a few more times: a mass the size of an apricot on his liver in the spring \u201899 was next, some lymph nodes removed six months after that, and then, just before last Christmas, fourteen small masses back on his liver.\n\u201cThe war comes for us all, in the end,\u201d Hopper had told Steve the night they\u2019d announced this most recent diagnosis. He had shaken out a cigarette from his pack and blown smoke rings into the night sky as he had sat on a rocking chair while Steve drank a PBR as he sat by his feet. Joyce had forbidden smoking in the house back when they were trying to get Hop to quit; it was either the porch or the old dairy barn out back for him now. \u201cI\u2019ve had some good years, and I\u2019ve had some bad, kid, but most of them have been good, especially these days.\u201d\nSteve had stared up at Hopper\u2019s smoke rings. After a moment, he\u2019d said, \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna get treatment for this one, are you?\u201d\n\u201cYou were always smarter than they gave you credit for,\u201d Hopper had said, smiling. They hadn\u2019t talked further about it, just drank quietly on the porch until Hopper had slowly risen, dropped a hand into Steve\u2019s hair and ruffled. He\u2019d said goodnight and turned in. Steve had sat on the stoop, in the cold Indiana winter, for another hour.\nNow, Steve was walking with Joyce and Nancy through downtown Santa Rosa, Jonathan lagging behind taking photos and Hopper walking ahead of them, hand in hand with little Barbie, laughing at something Madchen was saying while she gave Scott an effortless piggyback ride. Steve had already told them he was planning on setting her up with Robin, and they\u2019d immediately set about grilling her, but she\u2019d charmed all the accumulated Hopper-Byers, making fast friends with Nancy and Jonathan as they talked about Boston, talking basketball with Hopper, and just shooting the breeze with Joyce.\nNancy looped an arm in Steve\u2019s.\n\u201cNot long now, I don\u2019t think,\u201d she said quietly, just for him. Still Joyce heard and she sucked in a quick breath. Steve reached out to take her hand in his free one.\nThey all looked at Hopper. He wasn\u2019t frail, Hop, but he was smaller, less substantial than Steve ever remembered him being. He knew Hopper had made his peace with it, but he didn\u2019t know how any of the rest of them could. It was something that had haunted Steve since the fall of \u201883. Even if you were unafraid to die, it didn\u2019t mean you were ready.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Steve, squeezing Joyce\u2019s hand. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s just focus on Max,\u201d Joyce told them, \u201cand Lucas. I saw that boy this morning, he looked fit to throw up.\u201d\nNancy laughed. \u201cMax has been making him work for this wedding for the better part of a decade, and he\u2019s getting cold feet?\u201d\n\u201cNot cold feet,\u201d she said. \u201cJust nerves. Steve, you should talk to him.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m not team Lucas this weekend,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cI\u2019m with the bride! That\u2019s his dad\u2019s job, or Hop\u2019s.\u201d\nThey dissolved into arguing about who should, in fact, talk Lucas off the edge all the way back to the minivan Jonathan had rented for the weekend to ferry the family around. They all clambered in, Steve and Madchen squashed like sardines into the back with Barbie, who kept asking Madchen if she was a supermodel, and drove back to the house on the vineyard that Lucas and Max had gotten as part of their wedding package. They\u2019d decided to use it to house the Party and adjacent families.\nMax and Lucas were already there, along with the rest of the boys and El. Robin had had an important meeting that afternoon, so was flying in from Boston the next morning, and Eddie was on an international flight from Antwerp that was due to land around 9am. Erica was going to get in Saturday morning; she was supposed to have been on the same flight as Will but, arguably the smartest and most successful of them all, she was a lawyer for the Innocence Project and a court date for one of their clients had been moved up at the last minute.\nAs soon as Jonathan pulled the van in, Hopper and Joyce excused themselves early to the casita out back, offering to take Barbie and Scott so everyone could catch up and have fun.\nInside, Steve was greeted with raucous cheering and hugs. The kids had apparently gotten started early. Jonathan immediately beelined to take over the sound system from Dustin, who abandoned it in favor of throwing an arm around Steve. Nancy took off in the direction of El, who was something like seven months pregnant with her first kid and being hovered over by an increasingly paranoid Mike about it. Dustin and Max\u2019s new favorite pastime was ragging on him about it, apparently, but Nancy dispatched him neatly to go make conversation with Will and his new boyfriend.\nSteve introduced Madchen all around and she immediately settled in to talk shop with Lucas, which had apparently turned out to be the hidden fourth option for who should talk to Lucas about his nerves after Steve, Hopper, and Lucas\u2019s own dad.\u00a0\n\u201cDo we like this one?\u201d asked Steve, accepting a beer from Max and jerking his chin in the direction of Will and the aforementioned new beau. \u201cWill hasn\u2019t talked much to me about him.\u201d\n\u201cEh,\u201d said Dustin, always the harshest critic of the romantic options of his crew.\n\u201cNot eh,\u201d countered Max. She turned to Steve. \u201cWe like this one. He\u2019s a broadway actor, and so far has not displayed any dirtbag tendencies in our line of sight.\u201d\n\u201cCould just be a matter of time,\u201d Dustin said.\n\u201cJust because he\u2019s never played DnD \u2014 \u201d\n\u201c Yes  , because he\u2019s never played DnD! That is an  integral  facet of Will\u2019s personality, the core tenant of our \u2014 our  friendship, not to mention how it\u2019s affected \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cOh my Jesus god \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cHow about you, Dustin?\u201d Steve asked loudly. \u201cYou still seeing that production scout?\u201d\nDustin rolled his eyes but took the bait.\n\u201cNah, didn\u2019t work out.\u201d He wiggled his eyebrows at Steve. \u201cBut, like, Madchen \u2014 now,  she\u2019s  a babe.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s a friend,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPlatonic with a capital P?\u201d Max asked.\n\u201cVery much so,\u201d Steve told them. \u201cI brought her for Robin.\u201d\n\u201cLike an offering? Dude. She\u2019s a human being.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that you were just objectifying. Listen, I know they\u2019re gonna hit it off,\u201d he defended. \u201cAnyway, Max, how are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cBetter than Lucas,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s so wigged out about this. All we gotta do is wander up there, have Eddie undoubtedly embarrass us or something, kiss in front of his team, and then get hammered. Boom, easy.\u201d\n\u201cBoom, easy,\u201d echoed Dustin with a snort.\n\u201cFrankly,\u201d she continued, wiggling her beer in their faces, \u201cI\u2019m getting started on the hammered part early. There\u2019s apparently a golf cart on the premise and I would like to see how fast that sucker goes. Shall we?\u201d\n\u201cWho are we to deny the bride her wishes,\u201d said Steve, and shotgunned his beer.\n\u00a0\nEL (laughing): Oh my god! Listen, okay. I wrote the Kate Bush song as, like, like, a joke for a friend of mine. Kate Bush is her favorite artist, which I mean  obviously  I find horribly offensive because it\u2019s not  me, like,  rude,  and it was \u2014 straight up, straight up, I wrote it while we were getting high and listening to Kate Bush! Isn\u2019t art supposed to hold up a mirror to nature or whatever? Listen. Okay. I did it to make her laugh. Anyway. Like not to get pretentious on you or anything but, like, I think that's why we should make art and shit. To make people smile.\nJB: Did it?\nEL: Well, she called me a fucking clown when I did it, but she was smiling. Does that count?\n\u2014  Excerpted from \u201cEd Levy Wants You To Get High And Listen To Kate Bush,\u201d Mojo, July 1997 \n\n\n\n\nSteve woke the next morning, viciously hungover, and had only vague memories of being in a golf cart doing twenty-five across a dirt road while Max laughed like a madwoman behind the wheel and Dustin and Will screamed hysterically from the back.\nThere was a note on the bedside table from Madchen, telling him that she\u2019d gone to town with Nancy and the kids to help with a last minute thing for Max. She\u2019d also left him two Advil and a glass of water, though he was under no illusions that he would emerge from last night without any sort of ribbing or emotional blackmail; he hoped setting her up with the future love of her life would offset this.\nHe dry-swallowed the Advil and then drank the water before lying in the bed, staring up at the ceiling until the idea of getting out of bed didn\u2019t send every single one of his internal organs into open rebellion.\u00a0 There was a cool breeze coming in from the window and washing over him, a balm, and he could hear very faintly the sounds of the Party, laughing and hollering at each other, from somewhere out in the vineyard. Inexplicably, it made him feel like crying; he blamed it on the hangover.\nOnce everything settled and he was no longer in danger of being violently sick when he sat upright, it was almost noon. He threw on an old Indiana State hoodie and blearily made his way down to the kitchen. He could hear additional voices coming from there, murmurs to faint for him to actually make out individuals, but Robin\u2019s flight had been due in at something like eight a.m., and Eddie\u2019s just an hour later.\nSure enough, when he leaned himself up against the door frame, Robin and Eddie were at the scrubbed kitchen table, laughing at something, while El and Max looked on. El had one hand resting across the gentle swell of her stomach, not yet popped, and Max appeared to be even more hungover than Steve and possibly still drunk. They had a spread of pancakes in front of them, on a hotplate.\nRobin\u2019s wide, laughing smile wiped away any traces of jet lag she might be feeling, looking all for the world like she\u2019d been with them the entire time, but Eddie had dark, tired smudges under his eyes. He often looked tired when Steve saw him these days, running from one gig to the next, a recording studio to a soundstage to a press thing to a show. Yet even now, almost two decades beyond a broken beer bottle to the throat, leaning sleepily into his fist, exhausted, the remains of mascara flaked around his eyes, he was still the most beautiful person he had ever seen. This weekend didn\u2019t bode well for his heart, always a little battered by longing and regret and self-recrimination when in extended proximity to Eddie.\u00a0\nSometimes, he wondered if he\u2019d ever manage to screw his courage to the sticking point and just blurt the words out. But if he hadn\u2019t yet, he doubted he ever would, and there was a part of him that thought if Eddie felt the same, he would have said by now.\nHe found himself distracted by the strong, corded line of Eddie\u2019s neck and El had to call his name twice to get his attention.\n\u201cI made pancakes,\u201d she said, something vaguely judgmental but amused in her tone. Steve harbored the long suspicion that, these days, she read their minds for fun and profit; none of them entered bets with her anymore for a reason.\n\u201cThanks, kid.\u201d\n\u201cYou get the number of the bus that hit you, or what, Harrington?\u201d called Robin.\nHe flipped her off and made his way to the table, sinking down into the empty chair between Max and Robin. Immediately, her feet went into his lap and she handed him a plate of pancakes as Max shifted slightly to lean into Steve\u2019s side, soaking up his warmth.\n\u201cHow were your flights?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Robin. \u201cEddie got hosed.\u201d\n\u201cThey lost my bag during one of my layovers,\u201d he said. \u201cThank god I always buy a seat for my guitar, I think I would\u2019ve burst into tears right at baggage claim if I didn\u2019t. Not that I wasn\u2019t tempted already.\u201d\n\u201cI brought an extra suit jacket,\u201d offered Steve.\n\u201cBabe, I love you,\u201d Eddie said with a smile, \u201cbut your shoulders are twice the size of mine \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cTwice is a stretch \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019d just end up looking like a kid in my dad\u2019s suit, regardless,\u201d he finished. \u201cI was blessed, however, with some sort of premonition of the shape of things to come, however, and had tossed a  delightful  little number into my carryon before I quit lovely Belgium.\u201d\n\u201cI told you,\u201d mumbled Max from where she\u2019d smushed her face into Steve\u2019s shoulder, \u201cno assless chaps.\u201d\nEddie pointed an accusatory finger at her. \u201cAnd I told you I would not allow your puritanical sensibilities to stifle me! But, alas, those were the back-up and therefore in the checked bags.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s sequins,\u201d said Robin, leaning in to whisper into Steve\u2019s ear. \u201cAnd embroidery. He showed it to me in the town car from the airport.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to look like heavy metal Gram Parsons,\u201d he said, winking. \u201cNudie girls and everything. Oh, \u201cHeavy Metal Gram Parson\u201d would be a great name for a song \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cYou gonna wear a shirt under it?\u201d asked Robin.\n\u201cThat will be a game time decision, and frankly you\u2019ll be blessed either way.\u201d\nRobin took Steve\u2019s fork from his hand and ate a bite of his pancakes, despite having clearly eaten her own plate. \u201cHeard you brought a date.\u201d\nHe looked up from his plate in time to see Eddie looking away from him and Steve shrugged. He said, \u201cMy friend Madchen. She\u2019s heard a lot about you guys and wanted to meet you. So I figured, you know, why not now?\u201d\n\u201cWait.\u201d Robin\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cYou\u2019ve mentioned her. She\u2019s the girl\u2019s basketball coach, right?\u201d\n\u201cPretty. Strong,\u201d said El, approvingly. She\u2019d drunkenly arm wrestled and defeated all of the boys in quick succession last night before crushing a PBR can against her forehead, which had apparently endeared her to El for life. She added, \u201cTall.\u201d\nSteve nodded. \u201cVery tall, regularly beats my ass on the court. She would\u2019ve gone pro, if she could, like, actually make a living off it. She\u2019s the best, Rob, you\u2019re gonna love her,\u201d he added, over a rising commotion from the front of the house that signaled the boys had returned from whatever nonsense they\u2019d been getting up to.\u00a0\n\u201cShe better be the best,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t accept anything less for my darling Steve-O \u2014 \u201d\nHe rolled his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s not \u2014 \u201d\nThe boys spilled into the kitchen, raucous, a shout of \u201cPancakes!\u201d from Mike and \u201cEddie!\u201d from Dustin, and Max hissed and spit like a cat with her tail pulled.\n\u201cShut the fuck up, shut the fuck up,\u201d she said, pressing her face into Steve\u2019s shoulder harder.\nAcross the table, Dustin had draped himself across Eddie\u2019s lap and was rapid-fire questioning him about his European tour, while Mike and Lucas sat on either side of him after dropping kisses on their spouses\u2019 heads \u2014 El preened and Max made another disgruntled cat noise \u2014 and began to help themselves to the pancakes. Will slid in on Robin\u2019s other side, packing them all way too tight around the table. All four of them were windswept and chapped and grinning like a bunch of loons.\nOver Dustin\u2019s chatter, Lucas told them about the adventure they\u2019d just been on: they\u2019d been looking for a soccer ball or something to kick around earlier and had instead found four ancient ten-speeds in a back shed. Obviously, unanimously, they\u2019d all decided to take off on a bike tour through the vineyard, speeding around and reliving some of their childhood adventures on their bikes.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the boyfriend?\u201d asked Steve. \u201cBill?\u201d\n\u201cBen,\u201d said Will, smiling softly. \u201cHe\u2019s got an audition when we get back so he said he was just going to hang by the pool and work on his sides.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to him last night,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou mean grill him,  Mom,\u201d shot Dustin from across the table.\n\u201cThe day is young,\u201d offered Eddie. \u201cWe do have to make sure he\u2019s good enough for our youngest.\u201d\n\u201cI thought Erica was your youngest,\u201d said Will, rolling his eyes.\n\u201cMaybe, but we don\u2019t need to worry about Erica,\u201d said Steve, \u201cand she'd scalp me herself if I tried it.\u201d\n\u201cI could scalp you.\u201d\n\u201cYou could try, shrimp,\u201d he said.\nWill rolled his eyes even harder. \u201cI\u2019m literally like half a foot taller than any of you except Lucas.\u201d\nAfter the boys had eaten, El and Max disappeared into the biggest bedroom to do bride stuff \u2014 though Steve suspected that was just an excuse for Max to sleep off the rest of her hangover and El to just take a nap \u2014 while the boys, refueled, went back outside to terrorize each other on bikes. Steve heard something about a kitchen broom and jousting and immediately tried willing himself hearing loss.\nHe, Robin, and Eddie spent the rest of the afternoon in the living room of the house, day-drinking and passing a blunt between them. Eddie didn\u2019t smoke as much as he used to but still could be relied upon to be carrying, especially at larger group functions. Joyce and Hopper passed through once or twice, Hopper stopping to take a few hits, and the boys came and went as the need for snacks and drinks brought them back to the house; but mainly it was the three of them, Jonathan joining them a few hours in as he returned from a separate errand on behalf of Lucas, shooting the shit and getting pleasantly crossfaded as the afternoon wore on. Eddie regaled them with stories from the tour and discussed his current bout of \u201chorrifically crippling\u201d writer\u2019s block while Steve shared stories of his students, Robin got animated about a new exhibit, and Jonathan told them about the latest news story he and Nancy were chasing.\nAround four, the front door opened and shut and Nancy hollered, \u201cWe\u2019re back!\u201d as little kids' feet thundered into the living room. Robin pinched out the blunt as Barbie immediately launched herself at her and then at Eddie for hugs, Scott following behind. Two more sets of footsteps followed behind as a much more sedate pace and Steve leaned over to Robin, whispering, \u201cDon\u2019t say I never got you anything \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cWhat \u2014?\u201d\nMadchen turned the corner into the living room. At his side, he could feel Robin stiffen up and turned to see her eyes widen as she stared at the Amazon that had appeared in the doorway, one that Steve had spent the past year practically gift wrapping for Robin only for her to fail almost immediately at recognizing that he\u2019d done it. And she\u2019d always said he was the hopeless one.\n\u201cThis is my friend, Madchen,\u201d he said, shifting to the left so that she could sit next to him. \u201cMadchen, this is Robin and Eddie \u2014 \u201d\nBut Eddie had already slipped out the door, hand in hand with Barbie, and Steve frowned at his back and then made quick work of ignoring the looks the other adult in the room shot him, except Robin. She was leaning over Steve\u2019s lap to shake hands with Madchen, and Madchen, an expert at rolling with the punches and emotional upheavals (typically teenage), ignored the glances and made easy conversation with Robin.\nShe was, of course, one hundred percent aware of what had occurred. The only reason he got about five minutes' peace was because Madchen appeared to be also one hundred percent into Robin. She seemed genuinely intrigued by Robin\u2019s job as a museum curator, asking Madchen-typical insightful questions and getting Robin to stare increasingly starry-eyed at her in return as she, adorably, stumbled over her replies. It only made Madchen\u2019s smile grow wider as they spoke. Nailed it, thought Steve.\nIt couldn\u2019t last though. After a moment, she jerked her chin in the direction Eddie had lately gone.\n\u201cThat was him, right?\u201d she asked. \u201cI can see why you want the business from him. Not my type, but he\u2019s hot, in a nocturnal animal kind of way.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the absolute fuck is that supposed to mean?\u201d he demanded as the same time Robin manifested a pair and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s  your  type?\u201d\nMadchen ignored Steve in favor of giving Robin a once over so aggressively thorough that he was pretty sure he took some kind psychic damage just by witnessing it. He momentarily abandoned his indignant rage in favor of gagging expansively. Luckily for him, however, Madchen\u2019s horniness for an adorable nerd \u2014 a commonality between them that Steve knew of but never like to explore further about himself because he valued his mental stability \u2014 neatly derailed her desire to continue dragging Steve.\nHe took advantage of the moment and, ignoring the looks he was getting from Nancy and Jonathan, Steve slipped out from between them on the sofa, muttered something about grabbing some water, and escaped outside.\nDustin had cornered Steve last night too, about two drinks and a shot from putting their lives in Max\u2019s debatably licensed hands aboard a golf cart. Robin didn\u2019t give Steve much shit anymore these days about Eddie, thanks to a whiskey soaked evening back in \u201893 that Steve did not remember clearly but Robin did; Dustin however had no such reservations, and probably wouldn\u2019t anyway even if he\u2019d been there that night. When Steve had officially come out right after getting his Masters, he\u2019d immediately started trying to set Steve up with Eddie, who\u2019d been out to his friends since \u201888 and publicly since \u201894 when a fan had accurately connected some lyrical dots over pronouns.\nHe\u2019d taken it personally, was the thing; Steve and Eddie were his two favorite people, his big brothers, Mom and Dad the kids sometimes joked, and he\u2019d been clearly upset that Steve had kept shooting him down. He took it as a sign that he and Eddie were never friends but just \u201cstayed together for the kids,\u201d he'd said. He never shut the fuck about about it to Steve, frankly, and he had no idea if Dustin had ever tried the same thing with Eddie; he tried not to think about it, because he didn\u2019t really want to confront the possibility that Eddie was doing the same thing. He never claimed to be a rational person, okay?\nHe\u2019d shut Dustin up last night with another beer and a tequila shot that Dustin spit back out onto the ground, Steve laughing and Dustin shouting that of course he spit it out, it was  poison, it was a reasonable thing for your body to reject poison!\nMadchen was easier to avoid, but he was under no illusions that this weekend would allow him to escape the other attempts he knew would show up, trying to get him to open up about his personal life, his feelings. Joyce was a fair bet, and Nancy, but he could usually see them coming; the real dangers were either of the Byers boys, Jonathan in particular.\nHe sighed.\n\u201cPenny for them?\u201d\nSteve startled, looked to the side. Hopper was seated on the porch swing right by the steps. He wasn\u2019t looking directly at Steve, but instead at the lawn, where Barbie was sprinting madly too and fro, Eddie pretending to chase her, arms extended and growing as something or other. Maybe a bear; no one pretended to be a monster in this family, even for the kids.\n\u201cSorry, thinking,\u201d said Steve, moving forward to sit on the stoop, sort of at Hopper\u2019s knee, and stared out at the two of them goofing off in the yard.\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\nHopper snorted. \u201cPull the other one, kid, it\u2019s got bells on.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s not important. Just \u2014 shit. The usual stuff.\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Hopper reached down and picked up the beer at his feet, taking a drink. \u201cYou sure?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d said Steve.\nObjectively, Steve\u2019s parents hadn\u2019t been terrible. Objectively, they hadn\u2019t been great either. Just because someone didn\u2019t actually smack you around, didn\u2019t mean there still weren\u2019t other ways for them to hurt you. Steve had been a latchkey kid and it extended beyond just after school at a too-early age: by the time he was twelve, he was alone for whole weeks, a cook and a cleaner ghosting through his house, a nanny for a few more years until that stopped too. It was the kind of shit that Steve would be mandated to report these days, or at least bubble up and keep a closer eye on. But he was never dirty or hungry, he never skipped class too much, and he never failed but he never saw a grade above a C until he started dating Nancy. He just sort of existed, was fine, was okay, and there was enough money behind his father\u2019s name that no one gave him a second glance.\nNo one until Jim Hopper and Joyce Byers, that was, until they found him beat to shit and half concussed on Joyce\u2019s sofa and a gaggle of feral kids at his feet, arguing how best to clean up the cuts on his face and should they wake him up, it had been an hour since he fell asleep and you weren\u2019t supposed to let concussed people sleep, right? Somehow, the two of them had taken one look at his sorry ass and adopted him as their own.\nSteve hadn\u2019t seen it at first, had chaffed under Hopper\u2019s too watchful eye. He\u2019d resented him until he started to see that Hopper looked at him like he looked at the kids, and then he\u2019d only been able to wander at it, at how easy it had been for the two of them, for Joyce and Hopper to pick him up and settle them in between their outstretched arms. He\u2019d never had a family until that night, just matching names and genetic code and a joint bank account.\nAt length, he said, \u201cThanks, though.\u201d\n\u201cSure thing, kid,\u201d Hopper told him. He took another drink of his beer. \u201cYou seeing anyone?\u201d\nHe flopped backwards onto the porch. \u201cJesus Christ, not you too.\u201d\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said.\nSteve ran a hand over his face and sat back up, said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fucking sure about that. Not like I\u2019m the only one of your goddamn kids that shows up to family dinner every month without fail.\"\nHopper made a sort of contemplative noise. \u201cYou do call more than the rest too.\u201d\n\u201cI know I won\u2019t beat Will and El, but tell me I rank higher than Jonathan,\u201d he said, \u201cif only to make me feel better.\u201d\nSmirking, he took another sip of his beer.\n\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t really have time right now,\u201d Steve told him.\nHopper didn\u2019t dignify that with a response either, just stared somewhat pointedly out at the lawn. Barbie had grown tired of running around and now she and Eddie were sat cross legged in the grass; Eddie was showing her how to make flower crowns out of dandelions and clovers.\n\u201cJim,\u201d he said, plaintive, and Hopper put a hand on the top of his head, the echo of a memory.\u00a0\nHis thumb ran along the shell of his ear and he said, \u201cLife\u2019s short, Steve. I only want my kids to be happy.\u201d\n\u201cI am happy.\u201d Hopper dropped his hand and Steve said, \u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cHey! Hey!\u201d Barbie shot up from her seat and sprinted at a full tilt up to them, practically skidding to a halt with dust in her wake before she bounded up the stairs. She thrust her flower crown in first Steve\u2019s face and then Hopper\u2019s. \u201cUncle Steve, Grandpa, look what Uncle Eddie taught me to make! Here, Grandpa, you take it!\u201d\nShe clambered into Hopper\u2019s lap, surprisingly gentle, and stuffed her crown on Hopper\u2019s head, who immediately began turning his head this way and that for Barbie to admire, fluttering his lashes.\nEddie ambled up the stairs now too and sat down next to Steve. He set the crown he made on Steve\u2019s head, said, \u201cDon\u2019t want you to feel left out.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHow do we look?\u201d Hopper said little Barbie, who beamed.\n\u201cGood!\u201d she said, wriggling happily in her grandfather\u2019s lap. \u201cLike fairy princesses!\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Eddie was staring at Steve. Steve stared at the ground. He could feel Hopper\u2019s eyes on them both. \u201cYou look good.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh. Oh,  man,\u201d he says, leaning forward on his forearms, suddenly serious. Honestly, it\u2019s a little unsettling to be the center of Levy\u2019s attention: his eyes, wide and dark, self-described as Bambi-like on a good day, are consuming as he stares. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising, with Levy known for an intense focus on stage for all that he goofs off and jokes with his adoring fans, committed wholly and completely to his craft. This moment between us feels like a confessional, and I almost expect him to reach out and grasp my hands.\n\u201cThat was  life altering,  and trust me, dude, I know from life altering,\u201d Levy is telling me. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s one thing to have have my little album, like, pitted against guys like REM and Nirvana, but to have a song in the same category as my heroes \u2014 like Metallica is literally, fucking  literally  the reason I got into this.  Master of Puppets  honest to God, fuck hyperbole, really and goddamn truly saved my life when I was twenty. I mean fuck! Fuck! Like when people say it\u2019s an honor to just be nominated, it is an  honor just to be fucking nominated. Listen. Sorry I\u2019m swearing so much, but I cannot emphasize enough how huge that was for me.  James Hetfield shook my fucking hand.  He told me it was nice to fucking meet me! Lars shitting Ulrich said he thought  Girl with a Buzzcut  was one of the most interesting debuts from a musician in the last ten years! I thought I was gonna pass out! Jesus  Christ.\u201d\nWhat would you have done if you had won? I ask.\n\u201cCried and then thrown up,\u201d he says, zero hesitation, still as serious as if he\u2018d been discussing the conflict in Bosnia. \u201cLive on national television, I would have cried and ralphed all over the floor of Radio City.\u201d\n\u2014  Excerpted from \u201cFortune Favors the Fuck-Ups,\u201d Spin, June 1992 \n\n\n\n\nAt six p.m., on Saturday, on the fourth of May, Max Mayfield tucked her hand in the bend of Steve Harrington\u2019s elbow and breathed a laugh as Steve leaned down to whisper in her ear, \u201cThere\u2019s still time to flee to Canada. I give Eddie the signal, he\u2019ll vamp for an hour and you\u2019ll be long gone.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNo. This is right where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d\nShe leaned most of her weight on him and, together, slowly and steadily, they made their way down the aisle as an acoustic version of Kate Bush\u2019s \u201cLove And Anger\u201d began to play; Eddie had recorded the cover in a hotel bathroom right after Lucas had asked him to officiate the ceremony.\u00a0\nDespite claiming that he was Team Max for the weekend, Steve had checked in on Lucas two hours before the ceremony, slipping away when El, Joyce, Erica, and Robin were helping Max into her suit and knocking back champagne, laughing. Lucas had always looked up to him, he knew, especially after the incident with Billy, and he\u2019d felt a certain special kinship with him of all the kids. He loved all his nerds, but Mike was right: they were the jocks of the group, and Steve knew the others, especially back then, didn\u2019t get it. Lucas had felt isolated from his friends, and it had been made even worse because of how isolated he\u2019d already been in town. Steve couldn\u2019t pretend to get what that was like, even if he had an inkling back then because of how isolated Robin felt and Steve\u2019s own internal journey with his sexuality, a messy journey to be sure.\nWhat he could do, back then, was be there for Lucas in any capacity that he needed and also do what he did best: put his body between his kids and the danger, monsters or small town bigots alike.\nWhen Steve had stuck his head into the bedroom where the boys were, Lucas had immediately shot to his feet and asked, \u201cIs she okay?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d he had said. \u201cI\u2019m checking in on you. You\u2019ve been jumpy. I mean, you literally just jumped.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d He\u2019d walked over to Steve and they leaned in the doorway together. \u201cOh, I mean I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m great! I\u2019m nervous, sure, but, like. It\u2019s \u2014 I think maybe I\u2019d given up on her saying yes, you know? \u2018Cause I know she loves me, and that\u2019s enough. I mean, if she walked away right now, I\u2019d still be happy. I know marriage is a whole thing for her, and I\u2019m just happy to spend my life with her however she\u2019ll let me.\u201d\nSteve had pulled him into a brief hug. \u201cShit, kid, how did you get to be so well-adjusted?\u201d\n\u201cTherapy,\u201d Lucas told him.\nThey had laughed.\n\u201cBut seriously, dude, thanks for checking in on me,\u201d he\u2019d said when they\u2019d broken apart. \u201cI know you\u2019re Team Max this weekend, but like we kind of all have joint custody of you as the group's big brother with Eddie and Jonathan.\u201d\nNow, Lucas stood at the end of the aisle, beaming like an absolute lunatic, with Eddie to his left and the Party to his right. Steve could see Max\u2019s face from the corner of his eye, her own smile stretched wide to match, and he dropped her off with a kiss to her cheek. He handed her her cane, which he\u2019d had resting in the crook of his other arm, and shook Lucas\u2019s hand before heading back to his seat between Joyce and Madchen in the front row.\nEddie waited for him to be seated and gestured for the music to cut out. In his white suit, sequined and embroidered \u2014 nudie girls on the lapels as promised \u2014 the black curving letters of his Led Zep chest piece visible because he\u2019d held true to his promise and eschewed a shirt while Max had snorted and rolled her eyes, he looked indeed like heavy metal Gram Parsons, or maybe a heavy metal Elvis impersonator about to officiate a Vegas shotgun wedding. Ridiculously, it suited him.\nHe aimed a wink at Steve, like he could read his mind, and began, grave, \u201cDearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called  life . Electric word, life: it means forever and that\u2019s a mighty long time \u2014 \"\nGuests had started laughing as soon as Eddie had landed the little bit of extra emphasis on the word life, and they were all whispering and giggling to each other as Lucas and Max continued to beam at each other and Eddie got even more into his Prince recitation, especially as Lucas\u2019s parents really got into it.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m here to tell, there\u2019s something else: the afterworld,\u201d he said with a flourish of his hands. \u201cA world of never ending happiness. You can always see the sun, day or night. So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills, you know the one \u2014 \"\n\u201cDoctor Everything'll Be Alright,\u201d shouted Mrs Sinclair, laughing.\nEddie pointed to her, like a preacher agreeing with his congregation. \u201cInstead of asking him how much of your time is left, ask him how much of your mind, baby, \u2018cause in this life, things are much harder than in the afterworld. In this life \u2014 well, the poet said you\u2019re on your own. But this bard will have to humbly disagree, because, you see, since these kids before me were prepubescent little shitheads, they\u2019ve had each other. And now they\u2019ve decided to get a tax break from it!\u201d\nThe rest of the ceremony was a blur to Steve. Eddie was magnetic as he wove a highly redacted tale of Max and Lucas\u2019s teenage courtship, and Steve fought back tears the whole time, hand in hand with Joyce, squeezing tight to each other. Robin, between El and Erica, truly looked like she was going to lose it.\u00a0\nThey\u2019d spent so many years in absolutely hell and came out the other side, and it was as much a miracle to witness this wedding as it had been to witness Mike and El\u2019s backyard nuptials back in \u201893, and to stand on the steps of a Boston courthouse for Nancy and Jonathan in \u201888.\nAfter Eddie pronounced the newly christened Sinclairs now officially legally bound to ride or die and Lucas and Max had, laughing, kissed to seal the deal, the wedding party and guests had been herded into the massive covered pavilion the vineyard had for the reception.\nLucas hadn\u2019t been able to decide on a single best man and so the boys had all taken on various duties leading up to the wedding, but Dustin had been nominated by the Party to give the speech. It was, like Eddie\u2019s, highly redacted in parts and overlaid with the cover-story Owens and his crew had given to them all those years ago, but it was side-splittingly hilarious nonetheless, and contained many details that had Max practically snorting champagne out of her nose while Lucas hid his head in his arms in shame. Steve suspected, mainly by her smirk, that Erica had had a heavy hand in the crafting of it.\nEl gave a short and sweet speech on her friendship with Max, how much it had meant to her when she was going through a very difficult time in her life, how proud of Max she was for facing and overcoming her own challenges, and how proud she was to stand before them all and call her her best friend.\nWhile Steve was discretely wiping at his eyes as El closed the speech out, a series of looks were exchanged between all members of the Party. He looked up only in time to see El staring at him with those big eyes of hers, something dangerous in them, as she handed off the microphone to Max.\n\u201cI know how much everyone wants to party down, and so do I,\u201d she said, smirking, \u201cbut Lucas and I really wanted one last speech from another very important member of our lives, our favorite babysitter\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, fuck you both,\u201d said Steve, recoiling.\n\u201c\u2014and my adopted big brother, Steve,\u201d Max concluded. She wiggled the mic at him. \u201cSteve?\u201d\nAround him, the Party lost their whole minds. Mike and Will started a drum roll on the table while Dustin chanted, \u201cSpeech! Speech! Speech!\u201d\nRobin shoved at Steve\u2019s arms, the traitor, and pushed him to his feet. He said, \u201cThis is bullying. I\u2019m being bullied.\u201d\n\u201cSuck it up,\u201d said Lucas, grabbed the mic from Max, and tossed it underhand at Steve. He caught it, glaring.\nAcross the table, Eddie turned coat too and stuck his fingers in his mouth, letting loose an ear-splitting whistle.\n\u201cSeriously, fuck all of you,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay. Uh. Well, obviously this is a surprise and I would have had something prepared if  someone  had just  told me  , so just bear with me or whatever. Okay. Um. I\u2019m not really sure \u2014 listen, I\u2019m just so fucking proud of both of you, okay? Max, you are such an incredibly strong person, I\u2019ve never known anyone like you before. And Lucas, you are so smart and insightful and kind. I know it took you a while to get here. But, like, you guys knew, the thing is, loving each other isn\u2019t enough to be here. You gotta put the work in. On yourself, on your relationship. There\u2019s give, and there\u2019s take, and there\u2019s compromise and, like, so many small and huge things that go into a marriage. It\u2019s work. And you guys put in the work. And not only that, but, like, you want to make each other better. You want to be better people  for  each other. Yeah, because it\u2019s not just about love: it\u2019s about growth. You aren\u2019t the same people you were at twelve. You won\u2019t be the same people at forty. You\u2019re growing together, and you\u2019re loving the people you\u2019ve grown into. That\u2019s \u2014 to be brave enough to do that, to know yourself and your partner enough to say that wherever our growth takes us, I\u2019m going to love you and keep falling in love with you \u2014 that\u2019s amazing. You guys are amazing. I\u2019m so proud of you. I\u2019m so happy I get to be here to watch you, that you\u2019re here to do it. I, uh.\u201d He swallowed, bit his lip. \u201cYou know I \u2014 that I \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cWe know,\u201d said Lucas. He had tears on his cheeks, and Max had her mouth twisted as she fought back some of her own, blinking up at the ceiling. \u201cWe know.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, great,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I do. So much. Okay. Alright. To Max and Lucas. To these little shitheads who deserve each other.\u201d\nEveryone raised their glasses, toasting, and Steve sank back down into his seat, blindly handing the mic off to someone. Robin wrapped her arm around his shoulder.\n\u201cThat was really nice,\u201d she whispered in his ear.\nHe nodded. \u201cI wanna get super drunk. Can we get super drunk?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Robin said.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wedding,\u201d agreed Eddie from across the table. His big dark eyes were wide and wet and Steve couldn\u2019t look directly at him or he thought he\u2019d explode. \u201cI think we\u2019re contractually obligated.\u201d\n\u201cGreat,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I think I\u2019ve met my quota for being emotionally vulnerable for, like, the next three years with that and I would like to stop feeling things.\u201d\n\u201cYou got it, babe,\u201d said Eddie. \u201cOne bottle of tequila coming up.\u201d\nIt seemed, of course, that the rest of the guests had the same idea. After the dinner service came drinking and dancing and then came the wine cave that Max had told him about back in January and even more drinking. He lost sight of the Party early on and only caught the occasional glimpse of Eddie in his embroidered suit as he weaved his way through the crowd, making friends everywhere he went. Nancy and Jonathan had gotten an outside sitter for the night and appeared to be making good use of it, caught up with each other in a corner, every song a slow song no matter the tempo, and Steve danced with Robin and Madchen for a long time before he felt like he was becoming a third wheel.\nEventually, he found himself out within the vineyard itself. He stared up at the night sky. It was so clear out here; it reminded him of Hawkins, though it had been a long time since even before he left that Steve had stared up at the sky in wonder. He\u2019d known too many terrible things beneath his feet to feel anything but a deep dread at what could lie beyond the horizon.\nBut it was nice out here. He could almost forget.\nThere was a rustle behind him and Steve turned in time to see Eddie emerging between the plants.\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d he said. \u201cEl said she saw you go out this way.\u201d\n\u201cJust needed some fresh air,\u201d Steve told him.\nEddie tucked his hand inside the lapel of his jacket and Steve looked back up at the sky, away from the alternatively inky and pale expanse of his sternum. There was a curl of longing building within him and he tried to ruthlessly squash it back down; he already felt so raw, exposed, from the speech \u2014 he was worried he might start crying again, and how was he supposed to explain that without ruining everything?\u00a0\n\u201cI liked your speech,\u201d Steve said.\n\u201cThanks.\u201d A new noise, familiar, came from Eddie\u2019s direction and there was a brief flare of light. He glanced over to see Eddie cupping his hand around his mouth, lighting a blunt. \u201cI liked yours too.\u201d\n\u201cYours was funny.\u201d\nEddie\u2019s eyes flicked up from where he was concentrating on his spliff. \u201cYours was real.\u201d\nSteve licked his lips.\u00a0 He said, \u201cYours had Prince.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Mrs Sinclair\u2019s love was for sale and I wanted it,\u201d he said. \u201cI know Lucas gave his parents some bullshit story about WITSEC a million years ago when his dad recognized me, but they still look at me funny sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, man,\u201d said Steve.\nEddie shrugged and passed him the blunt. \u201cWhat can you do? Anyway, I totally promised her I\u2019d get her an autograph from the Purple One the next time I\u2019m at an event with him, so case closed.\u201d\nHe took a hit and passed it back, saying again, \u201cI can still be sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI can still tell you to fuck off,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyway. I, uh, hate to break it to you, but I think your girl might be going home with Robin?\u201d\n\u201cMadchen is not my girl, first of all,\u201d Steve said, \u201cand I should fucking hope so \u2014 that\u2019s why I brought her.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, man, I thought everyone knew?\u201d He shrugged now. \u201cWe work together. She\u2019s my best friend in Chicago. We went on one ill-fated date when she got hired at the school because we both like basketball and apparently that was enough for the rest of the staff to decide to marry us off. But turns out she likes petite band nerds better than jocks with great hair, so I called an audible and decided to marry her off to Robin.\u201d\n\u201cWell then,\u201d said Eddie around a mouthful of smoke. He held the blunt out to Steve again. \u201cYou are doing a bang-up job at that, because Robin looked to be about twenty minutes and another drink from climbing your friend like an oak tree.\u201d\n\u201cWell, the living room couch looked comfortable,\u201d he said, blowing a ring up into the night sky.\nEddie laughed, moving to jostle his shoulder. \u201cPlease, you\u2019re always welcome in my room.\u201d\nSteve smiled and it struck him, the two of them, alone among the vines, in the dark, like a memory from long ago. It made his breath catch, but not for the reasons those types of memories usually did. He turned to say something but the words got stuck in his throat as he realized how close the two of them were to one another. Steve stared at Eddie, who stared back, and Steve honest to God thought about it for the first time in forever: leaning in \u2014\u00a0\nFrom somewhere beyond them, there was a burst of hysterical, loud laughter, and Lucas shouting.\u00a0\nHe and Eddie startled apart.\nSomething splashed and the laughter grew louder.\nSomeone, Steve suspected, had tossed Lucas into the pool.\nWordlessly, the two of them turned to go investigate, the moment, whatever exactly it had been, lost; and as they walked, Steve took another hit off the blunt. He passed it back to Eddie once more, they walked on just a bit farther until the lights of the reception illuminated the house and the pool, and sure enough there was Lucas, still fully dressed and spitting mad in the pool while Mike and Dustin looked on and laughed. Max, on the other side with El and Will, made eye contact with Steve and sent him a two finger salute before she tossed her cane to the side with a clatter and joined her new husband, wedding suit and shoes and all, in the pool.\u00a0 With a wild yell, Dustin cannonballed in next, then Mike, then El more carefully, sedately, helped in by Will, who dove in next.\nEddie turned to Steve, smirking, one hand outstretched in a gallant,  after you  sort of gesture.\n\u201cMy liege,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Steve. He fisted one hand in Eddie\u2019s jacket and before he could do anything more than raise a questioning brow, Steve was tipping himself backwards into the water, Eddie, laughing, following in his wake.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe unlocks the door to the studio, flicks the lights on, and says without preamble, \u201cI haven't written anything new in, like, three years that isn\u2019t total  shit, so I kind of hate it here right now.\u201d\nLevy sits himself behind the controls of the recording booth and waves a hand at me, gesturing to the oversized leather sofa against the wall. He continues, \u201cAt first I thought it was because  i\u2019m not angry anymore  had been so, you know, pivotal or whatever. It took me a whole year after  METALHEAD  to get a song out, and I was blocked for six months after  Is This The Last Time?  too. But this is, like, next level shit, I guess.\u201d\nIs this why you recorded the live album?\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize what was happening then. Like I said, I\u2019ve gone stretches before without writing. I thought I just needed to give it time. I was burnt out and tired from touring all the time and my manager was like, well, we\u2019re still negotiating the European tour, let\u2019s push it back more, why don\u2019t you hang around home for a bit, do some shows at the old haunts. So I did, and people were really liking it \u2014 all  MTV Unplugged  and shit.\u201d\nYou did an  MTV Unplugged, I think.\n\u201cYeah! Good memory. \u201895, never got released.\u201d Levy leans back in his chair. His fingers drum absently against the arms. \u201cSo I thought, you know, why don\u2019t I record one of these too. And it was fun. I\u2019ve always loved doing covers, I think you can do really interesting and transformative \u2014 subversive \u2014 shit with it, you know? You can create this new conversation and experience around it. And like I like an acoustic version of my own shit too, yeah? It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s raw in a different way than the song it was originally crafted as, if that makes sense?\u201d\nAll the demos, then, on  B-Sides  \u2014\nHe points a finger at me. \u201cYes!  B-Sides and Rarities  is more a response to my block, than  Live At The Crocodile. Live At The Crocodile  was a good time, was a  vibe.  But I could name what was happening during  B-Sides.  So I decided to try to fight it, and compiled covers and demos and songs I\u2019ve played at gigs but never dropped on an album, because I thought it would maybe help unlock something, if I recorded and re-recorded and shared those demos. Like, if I bared my soul again and again and shared the raw, unfiltered, fucking broken love song that is the demo of  I Wore His Jacket  or the frankly depressing ten-minute version of  Chrissy\u2019s Song  that rightly makes people ask how my therapy is going \u2014 I thought if I let those things go, I\u2019d be, like, free. Personally, creatively.\u201d\nBut it hasn\u2019t worked.\nLevy sighs. \u201cNope. Sure fucking hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u2014  Excerpted from \u201cWhen Suffering Grows a Garden, Set It On Fire,\u201d Fader, March 2001 \n\n\n\n\nThe call came in as Steve was packing up his office for the summer. He came in more often during breaks than some of the teachers, unless they taught one of the summer remedials, because he always had a few overachievers in each year that were planning ahead or had recent grads that needed talking off this ledge or that; but he still liked to clean out the previous year\u2019s detritus so he could start totally fresh in August. He was just rubber-banding the last stack of files he\u2019d be boxing up for the school archives when his Blackberry nearly vibrated off his desk. He caught a glimpse of Jonathan\u2019s name as he rescued it and put it to his ear.\n\u201cHey, J, what\u2019s up, man?\u201d he said, tucking it against his shoulder so he can have his hands free. \u201cYou just caught me on clean out, about to swing by the last grad event \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Hopper,\u201d said Jonathan.\nFor a moment, Steve just stood there. It felt like \u2014 the words didn\u2019t compute right away, was the thing, just a moment of numbness, blank incomprehension, but then they were crashing over him and it was obvious. It had been obvious that day last winter, and it had been obvious just a month ago at the wedding: the way Hopper had looked at them all. It was like he\u2019d been trying to memorize their faces, their voices. He\u2019d spent so much of that weekend just sort of sat back, taking stock of them, drinking them in like this would be the last time.\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Hopper on the porch next to him, how he\u2019d tried to talk to Steve and Steve wouldn\u2019t let him, wouldn\u2019t let him tell him to just be happy because he wanted all of his children to be happy. It had been obvious: this round of cancer was going to be the last one and it was going to be fast, brutal, the final chapter. Had those words been the last he\u2019d said directly to Steve?\nNo, they\u2019d spoken on the phone just last week \u2014 Hopper and him were making plans to go see the Royals when the Padres were in town at the end of the month \u2014 and he was supposed to come down for dinner on Sunday, and Joyce wanted his help painting one of the guest rooms, and, and, and \u2014\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Jonathan was saying down the line. \u201cSteve.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m here. Are you \u2014 do you need me to \u2014 is anyone with Joyce, I can be there \u2014?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean. Sorry. Shit, no, I didn\u2019t.\u201d He could picture him shaking his head, half the country away, saying, \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t mean. Mom\u2019s fine, she\u2019s with him. He\u2019s still here, I meant. Fuck, sorry. It\u2019s just \u2014 he collapsed this morning. Mom took him to the hospital, and they didn\u2019t want to release him but you know Hop, flat out refused to stay, checked himself out AMA. Said he\u2019s gonna die at home with his family if he\u2019s gotta die anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Steve again. He scrubbed a hand across his face.\n\u201cI just meant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening, is what I meant. It\u2019s time. The doctors said, Mom said.\u201d\nHe took a deep breath. \u201cOkay. Who do you need me to call?\u201d\nJonathan took a deep breath too; his caught in a kind of sob. \u201cThanks, S. God, you were always the one best in a crisis, huh?\u201d\n\u201cHad to make myself useful somehow,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHey,\u201d said Jonathan in that too-soft voice of his that usually precipitated Steve unwillingly confronting his own self-worth issues and Jonathan saying something like  I think you\u2019re very brave and I\u2019m proud of you  at the end of it. He said, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna touch that right now because I recognize that other things have to take a front seat, but when I see you next, I\u2019m gonna hug you for an extra two minutes and I need you to know it\u2019s about that right there, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, Jesus Christ, which of us is the queer here?\u201d\n\u201cYou just upped yourself to five minutes, you want to keep going?\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright, get off my dick, Byers,\u201d he said, laughing a little. This was yet one more thing that the Steve of 1983, or even \u201886, would never believe \u2014 that on top of Dustin, he would\u2019ve gained another two brothers in the form of the Byers boys, that he would be laughing and joking with Jonathan even as they planned for one of the hardest moments of their lives.\nWith a list in hand, he and Jonathan exchanged good-byes and see you soons and hung up. Steve sank back into his chair and held his head in his hands, counting to ten in his mind, then twenty, then thirty. Just because you were unafraid to die, he thought again, didn\u2019t mean you were ready.\nHe had Robin on his list, naturally, and Max and Lucas and Dustin. He made the phone calls quickly, moving through them with a sort of detachment that felt like an out of body experience, telling them to head home to Indiana as soon as they all could and that he\u2019d be there when they arrived. Then, he rose from his desk, zipped up his shoulder bag, locked his office, and headed home to pack a bag.\nIt was four and a half hours from his loft to Memphis, Indiana, mostly a straight shot down the southbound I-65 after you got into Indiana. Steve shaved forty-five minutes off his travel time, and was pulling up outside the retired dairy farm Hopper and Joyce had called home for nearly a decade now at around eight pm. The sun was just beginning to set, the sky a smear of orange and purple over pale blue, but the lights had yet to get turned on in most of the windows. Steve pulled his \u201897 Subaru Impreza \u2014 his old BMW sold off years ago to pay for his first semester of grad school \u2014 in between Hopper\u2019s beat to shit Toyota truck and a \u201895 Chevy Blazer with New York plates \u2014 El and Mike, he remembered abruptly, had driven down a week or two after the wedding, to spend the summer with Hopper and Joyce as her due date approached.\u00a0\nHe sat in his car for a moment, staring up at the big old farmhouse, the defunct dairy parlor looming behind it like a shadow. To the left there were old cow pastures that Joyce was talking about renting out to some local farmers to grow corn \u2014 El and Mike had gotten married just beyond them, under a pergola constructed by Hopper, Steve, and Jonathan that was, miraculously, still standing; Hopper had had to rush Steve to the hospital halfway through because he\u2019d nearly sawed off the index finger on his left hand, and Hopper had written on Steve\u2019s in take form that he was his dad; they\u2019d never talked about it after \u2014 and to the right was a densely wooded area that eventually became a part of some state park he could never remember the name of.\nHopper\u2019d had renovated the place back in \u201892, with all that government hush money they\u2019d each gotten a piece of. He\u2019d been planning to build somewhere entirely from scratch, had an architect and blue prints and everything, when he\u2019d stumbled across the old farm on the Kentucky border that\u2019d been abandoned for years. The architect had seen Hop\u2019s vision right alongside him when he\u2019d showed it to her, and had gotten to work with her firm on renovation plans instead.\nHe\u2019d wanted a big home, something huge and sprawling so that he could house all of the people he cared about under his roof. He\u2019d wanted to give them a safe place to return to, somewhere he could protect them within the bones of his house like he\u2019d always wanted to protect them within the bones of his own body. It had been El first, of course, back in \u201883, but the rest of them had surely but slowly crept into his heart alongside of her and Hopper had never let them go.\u00a0\nSteve crawled out of his car, stretching with his hands at the small of his back. He hadn\u2019t stopped since he left Chicago, just drove straight through, and he needed a moment to collect himself.\nThe lights above the wrap around porch clicked on and he grabbed his hastily packed overnight bag out of his car. He trudged up the old brick walk and the door swung open as his feet alighted on the steps to reveal El, approximately five years pregnant to look at her. She\u2019d popped since the wedding, and how.\nShe leveled him with a Hopper-esque glare, as if to encourage him to try it, so he just dropped his bag and swept her into his arms instead. She clung to him, like a child.\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d he asked. He got a mouthful of her hair but he didn\u2019t mind.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. Her hands were fisted in the soft cotton of his t-shirt.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cHow you sleeping?\u201d\nShe pulled back just slightly. \u201cBad. Kicks.\u201d\n\u201cI bet,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou are first,\u201d she told him, pulling back further. \u201cWill and Jonathan, with Barbie, get here tomorrow. Nancy had a deadline, so she will be here Friday with Scott.\u201d\n\u201cDustin, Max, and Lucas all got the same flight out of LAX on Friday too,\u201d Steve told her, moving to scoop up his bag in one hand and hold El\u2019s in the other. She led him to the kitchen, where Mike was washing dishes mechanically. She sat at the table in front of a half-eaten plate of something that Steve didn\u2019t want to look too closely at because the smell was  alarming. He made brief eye-contact with Mike, who grimaced and shook his head. Steve said, \u201cRobin\u2019s moving to Chicago this weekend, so she and Madchen will be down Sunday night after the movers leave.\u201d\nLesbians, he thought fondly.\n\u201cWill said Eddie\u2019s flying in from an  undisclosed location,\u201d  said Mike over his shoulder. \u201cSo who knows when he\u2019ll get here.\u201d\n\u201cIs he on tour?\u201d he asked.\nEl scooped a bite of her nightmare dinner into her mouth and leveled him with a look that Steve didn\u2019t feel like dignifying with a response. Mike, luckily, wasn\u2019t watching them, so he answered, \u201cNo idea. He\u2019s writing somewhere, he said.\u201d\nWill and Eddie had, somewhat predictably, become fast friends in the aftermath of Hawkins, pen pals, phone buddies. He knew Mike and Dustin had been stupidly jealous about it when it happened but Steve, well aware that he had his own issues there and therefore had no leg to stand on, gave that a wide berth. They were both dungeony leaders or whatever, anyway, and writers to boot, even if they had different mediums; it made sense that they were close and, frankly, Steve felt like the littlest Byers should get as many nerdy friends as he wanted anyway.\n\u201cTired?\u201d asked El.\n\u201cA little,\u201d he said. \u201cDrove straight here.\u201d\nShe nodded. Mike said, \u201cJoyce made up your room.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d\n\u201cWith Dad,\u201d said El. Her face was unreadable. \u201cTired, too.\u201d\n\u201cI bet,\u201d Steve said. \u201cDo you guys mind if I head upstairs to drop my bag and wash the car smell off?\u201d\nEl shook her head. \u201cLeftovers in the fridge, if you are hungry.\u201d\nSteve shot Mike a quick look. Mike mouthed,  Not the red one. Steve smiled at El. \u201cSure. If I don\u2019t see you guys, sleep tight, okay?\u201d\n\u201cEl\u2019s been keeping weird hours,\u201d Mike told him. \u201cI know you do too, so we\u2019ll probably see each other before morning.\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d Steve smiled at them both again and turned on his heel, heading for the back staircase that circumvented the majority of the guest rooms, and the main bedroom on the second floor where no doubt Joyce and Hopper were.\nHopper had, of course, insisted on more guest rooms than any reasonably sane person would during the renovation. Each of his gaggle of dubiously adopted feral kids needed a room to call their own, no matter that half of them were often on a sort of constant move. They hadn\u2019t all been personalized for each of them for that reason, trading around based on who was where at what time, but they all had their favorites and things that felt like them ended up in them over time. El favored a room that looked out over the old cow pastures, and Max and Lucas had staked a claim early on to a ground floor bedroom, though Hopper had installed a chair lift that was honestly more often used by the boys when they\u2019d been drinking than Max herself. Nancy and Jonathan always used the guest room that had an en suite that connected to another bedroom, where their kids stayed.\nPersonally, Steve\u2019s favorite was the attic. Joyce had, at some point, rustled up a few articles about him from back in Hawkins, box scores and a few write-ups about his time captaining the swim team and the sophomore basketball game that was their closest ever run at States while he was on the team and had them tastefully framed as decor. She\u2019d also had a large photo made of him in his cap and gown from Chicago State, trapped in a bear hug from a beaming Dustin.\nThere were a few pictures of Eddie framed on the walls too. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was because the rare occasion that saw Eddie returning to Indiana had him crashing in the attic or if it was just because subtly was not one of Joyce Byers\u2019 passions. Steve knew Hopper had each of Eddie\u2019s albums hanging down in his office, but Joyce had gone with magazine covers for this room: the \u201894 NME cover, curled over his guitar with a cigarette hanging from his mouth in some studio; the Mojo one where he was holding up a copy of Kate Bush\u2019s  The Dreaming; the first one he ever got, some shot of him just performing, for a tiny outfit out of Seattle; and, of course, his biggest cover, the Rolling Stone one \u2014\u00a0\nEddie, sprawled on some hotel bed, his hair a wild halo around him not smiling, serious; Eddie, a threadbare Megadeth t-shirt, a hole in the collar,  RIP Mary Jane, rucked up to just under his pectorals; Eddie, the tortured and lovely expanse of his stomach, the flowers he used to half cover the demobat and surgical scars, the fine line of hair at his naval, lower; Eddie, one hand on his belt buckle, one in his hair, his ringed fingers; Eddie, staring directly at the camera; Eddie, his eyes, wide, the darkest eyes Steve had ever known \u2014\u00a0\nSteve dropped his bag by the dresser in the corner. He collapsed onto the bed and sat there for a long time, head in his hands, until the room slowly faded into darkness, illuminated poorly by the new moon.\nA light flicked on and Steve looked up to see Joyce in the doorway. She must've skipped the creaky stair; he would've heard her otherwise.\n\u201cI thought I heard you moving around up here,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cDid I wake anyone?\u201d\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re up,\u201d she said. She padded over on quiet, stockinged feet, sat down next to him.\n\u201cHow are you, sweetie?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d he countered.\nJoyce stared at him for a moment before taking his hand in hers. His was so much bigger, and it was wild, how he forgot things like that. Joyce, like Hopper, had always seemed larger than life to him: brave and sturdy and fearless, she took up way more space than her tiny frame allowed, than what everything she\u2019d ever been through suggested she should. He thought of what her shitty first husband had done to her, the things he\u2019d learned from Jonathan and Will over the years; he thought of the way the town \u2014 the way  he  \u2014 had treated her in the wake of Will\u2019s disappearance and supposed death, and everything that followed after; the way everyone had looked at her like she was crazy but she still held her head high and dared them all to not meet her eye. She\u2019d been through so much, and now  this.  What  bullshit.\nIt wasn\u2019t fucking fair, and he told her so.\nShe stared at him for a moment longer.\nJoyce Byers had never not given it to Steve straight, neither her nor Hopper, in fact, the only two reliable adults in Steve\u2019s whole life, it felt like. So he wasn\u2019t surprised when she sighed, just the once, and shifted so that she was sat facing him. She didn\u2019t let go of his hand.\n\u201cNo, Steve,\u201d she said, \u201cit isn\u2019t fair. Of course it isn\u2019t fair. I don\u2019t think a single fair thing has ever happened to any of us. But I wouldn\u2019t trade it. Every terrible thing has led to every good thing. That\u2019s what\u2019s hard, I think, to really understand. My boy disappearing brought Hopper and El and you, Steve, into my life, and no, the agony of those few days, the terror, the grief \u2014 none of that is ever going to go away. It\u2019s going to heal, scar, but so many good things have come in its wake, and I won\u2019t be mad at it. To be mad at it, to be furious, would be to give into the sadness.\u201d She squeezed his hands; her eyes were bright. She told him, \u201cAnd I refuse to be sad about where I am now. Do I want things to be different? Of course. I want a world where Will doesn\u2019t still have nightmares, where El doesn\u2019t have to live in fear that maybe, someday, someone will come looking for her. Where Max doesn\u2019t have a wheelchair in the hall closet for the bad days, where Eddie didn\u2019t have to choose between his scars and his tattoos, and where people don\u2019t stare at your neck in the grocery store, wondering how someone who looks like you got something that looks like that. Where Sarah lived for me to know her, and where Hop \u2014 do I want more time? We all want more time. But what I had was enough, and I would do it again and again, because it would mean that I got to love him again, new and unvarnished and terrible and wonderful. Grief and growth live hand in hand, Steve, and I wouldn\u2019t change a single thing.\u201d\n\u201cEven the monsters?\u201d he asked.\nJoyce kissed his temple. \u201cEven the monsters, sweetheart.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeople are weird about flowers,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially on men, which, like, get out of my face with that heteronormative, gender conforming bullshit. That is not punk, okay, that is not metal. Still talk a lot of smack about my flower tattoos though, they think I should\u2019ve kept the scars \u2014 because that\u2019s more metal than, like, my violets and shit. But violets mean resurrection, man. What\u2019s more metal than to live and die and live again? Like it\u2019s my body, bro, and my tattoos and I am the only person who gets to decide how I react to my trauma, okay? To the things that almost killed me \u2014 did kill me, a little bit, I was legally dead and met God, she looks great. I kept a few but mostly I wanted to reclaim it, my scars, what happened. Here, look. So there\u2019s the violets \u2014 resurrection \u2014 and ivy means endurance and thistle actually has a couple meanings and I liked them all: pain, protection, pride. Monkshood means death, which I decided to take in, like, the tarot kind of way, that death isn\u2019t  death,\u00a0but change, rebirth. Nasturtium mean  victory in battle.  And these are asphodel, which I think is the most metal of my flowers. It means  my regrets will follow you to the grave, which like, that would be a killer name for a song now that I'm thinking about it. Hold on, I gotta write that shit down \u2014 \u201d\n\u2014  Excerpted from \u201cFable, Legend, or Horror Story: Ed Levy Talks a Place Beyond the Quarry,\u201d NME, August 1994 \n\n\n\n\nSlowly, one after the other, the rest begin to arrive. There was a lot of silently holding each other in hallways and doorways, twos and threes and fours, hands fisted in shirts and curled into hair, breaths wet and stuttered, until Hopper inevitably rocked up on them with a mug of coffee in one hand, muttering, \u201cPussies,\u201d as he walked past.\nSteve tried to keep busy while he waited for everyone to get there. He helped Joyce air out rooms, painted that guest room, drove to the grocery store with Mike and Jonathan, when he got there. He looked after Barbie so Jonathan could have some time alone with his mom and step-dad, and took over dishwashing duty at the end of the night so Mike could spend some quiet time with El. As the resident insomniac of the group, too, he was regularly dispatched at all hours of the night to go pick up whatever heinous thing El\u2019s pregnancy was demanding that she eat.\n\u201cCan\u2019t be as weird as when Nancy was craving dirt when she was carrying Scott,\u201d Jonathan had commented one afternoon when Steve was coming back from a coleslaw run.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d Steve had asked.\nHe had shrugged. \u201cApparently it\u2019s pretty common. Doctors think it has to do with an iron deficiency.\u201d\nSteve had looked at El, who was adding peach jam to her coleslaw and watching the conversation like it was a tennis match. He had said, \u201cI can let this happen, but I\u2019m drawing a line at dirt. Do not ask me for dirt.\u201d\nShe\u2019d spooned some of her coleslaw peach mush into her mouth while Steve had valiantly fought the urge to gag. She\u2019d asked, \u201cWhy would I ask you for dirt when there is\u00a0 a whole yard of it right there?\u201d\nSteve had turned on his heel and left.\nWhen Dustin, Max, and Lucas arrived, he\u2019d been on his way out for one of those runs and Dustin had asked to come along, tossing his bag into a corner of the living room and turning immediately to follow Steve out the door. It had just supposed to be a quick mission to the gas station for something salty for El to add to a yogurt but it turned into a four hour aimless drive around town. He was sure El wouldn\u2019t mind.\n\u201cHow you doing, kid?\u201d asked Steve on their third pass of the main drag. They\u2019d already shot the normal breeze \u2014 work, dating, a dig at Steve for being a chickenshit that Steve manfully resisted the urge to retaliate for, had he seen any good movies he didn\u2019t work in lately, was that Jar Jar fucker gonna be in the third prequel too and also  why, and did Dustin maybe want to come to Chicago in December to see the next Lord of the Rings \u2014 but Steve could see something working behind Dustin\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said after a moment. He was staring out the window. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be ready, you know? After all, we\u2019ve done it once before, right?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s different,\u201d Steve told him. \u201cYou know it\u2019s different.\u201d\nDustin sighed. \u201cI know. It\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s Hopper. It\u2019s El\u2019s  dad.  I\u2019m not ready. I know we\u2019ve been \u2014 I know the writing\u2019s been on the wall, but I\u2019m still not ready.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\u201cI know that too. But why\u2019s it gotta be like this?\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, man,\u201d said Steve, thinking about his talk with Joyce, \u201cbut after everything we\u2019ve been through? I don\u2019t mind quiet. I think we deserve quiet. He\u2019s lived a hard life. He deserves peace at the end, with his family.\u201d\nDustin scrubbed his hands across his face. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cYou guess? You guess? Shithead, you know I\u2019m right,\u201d he said, stretching a hand out to jostle his shoulder.\u00a0\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d He snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t act like you got your shit together, like, with  anything  else. You forget I know all about your big gay \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay, shut the fuck up,\u201d said Steve. \u201cYou wanna head back or drive around a little more? I know that plane ride was long.\u201d\n\u201cDrive a little bit, I think,\u201d Dustin told him, and so they did.\nIt was pretty late when they got back, the vast majority of the house asleep, except for El who was in the kitchen drinking a glass of water and glaring balefully at a yogurt cup. Her face lit up when they entered, wrapping Dustin in a quick hug, before thanking Steve and making grabby hands at the plastic bag he was carrying, predictably understanding of their tardiness in returning and honestly just thrilled that someone was willing to run errands for her at all hours. He handed off what he picked out \u2014 peanuts, cornnuts, pork rinds, and a Slim Jim among a few others \u2014 and beat a quick retreat before he had to learn which one the winner was. He saw Dustin to his preferred room on the third floor before making his way up to the attic. He promptly crashed face first into the sheets of the bed that had felt more like a home than anywhere else he\u2019d ever slept, only to be woken in the pitch black by a weight settling onto the side of the bed. Steve came up swinging.\u00a0\nWhen he was able to get his eyes open enough to register what was happening, Eddie was standing at the side of the bed, hands raised, eyes wide.\nSteve slumped back into the pillows, heart going a mile a minute. He put a hand over his eyes and muttered, \u201cJesus fucking Christ. Did I get you?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Sorry,\u201d Eddie said, hushed. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to \u2014 they said you wouldn\u2019t mind me bunking up here with you, when I got in. I can sleep on the floor \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d Steve was whispering too; he wasn\u2019t sure why: it was the attic, and Hopper always claimed it was soundproof \u2014 Steve wasn\u2019t too sure about that, personally \u2014 and it was something like two a.m., the whole house was fast asleep. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of room. Get in.\u201d\nEddie stared at him a little longer, dark eyes reflecting the scant light from the harvest moon hanging above them, searching. At last, he said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and sat back on the edge of the bed.\nSteve watched as he took off his shoes \u2014 Docs, ancient, stuffing his socks into them \u2014 and then as he pulled off the t-shirt he\u2019d had on and shimmied out of his jeans. He was wearing briefs with little luchador masks on them, and Steve had to bite back a smile. He\u2019d gotten a new tattoo since the last time Steve saw him stripped down to his skin and underwear, a large tree on his hairy upper thigh, an oak, maybe. He thought maybe there was something written into the bark of the tree, carved, someone\u2019s initials maybe, but he couldn\u2019t quite see it in the dark. His eyes traced over the others, quickly cataloging: the snarling tiger that was the center of his right sleeve, the stylized Zeppelin lyrics just beneath his collarbones, those bats that Steve had once asked him why he didn\u2019t get them covered.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want what happened to us to change everything about me,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the Upside Down to destroy all the things I used to love. It took enough, right? From all of us?\u201d\nIt had been \u201895, \u201896, when they\u2019d had that talk, and Steve had been wearing nothing but turtlenecks in public for a decade. He\u2019d touched his collar and Eddie had watched his fingers, silent. Steve had nodded and said, \u201cYeah. It has.\u201d\nHe asked, still in a whisper, \u201cYou have a gig?\u201d\n\u201cHmm? No.\u201d Eddie slid beneath the covers, moving his shoulders restlessly as he settled onto his back. \u201cWriting the new album.  Trying  to write the new album, been trying for four years. Rented this house in the middle of Buttfuck Nowhere, British Columbia. Took me forever to fly in after Will called me, I think I was in a goddamn crop duster at one point.\u201d\nSteve snorted.\n\u201cBut I made it,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWhen did you get in?\u201d\n\u201cCouple days ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just El and Mike when I got here.\u201d\n\u201cHow are they doing? You?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been better.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Hop?\u201d\n\u201cHates the fuss we\u2019re making,\u201d Steve told him. Beside him, Eddie snorted. \u201cI swear, if the man had his way, he would\u2019ve just, like, wandered into the woods when none of us were looking and been done with it. He won\u2019t even tell me what he wants done, like, after, you know?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s because I\u2019m taking care of that.\u201d\nHe blinked into the darkness. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Eddie touched the back of his hand, brief. \u201cI told Jim I\u2019d handle it when he called to tell me he wasn\u2019t gonna go into treatment this time. You guys shouldn\u2019t have to \u2014 listen, don't look at me like that, I know you\u2019re gonna be like  but you\u2019re family too, but don\u2019t act like I don\u2019t know how you and Joyce were the ones to take care of the stuff for Wayne for me. You\u2019re not a fucking island, Steve, I wish you wouldn\u2019t pretend like you don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not an island,\u201d he protested. It sounded weak to his own ears in the quiet of the attic.\n\u201cYeah, shut the fuck up,\u201d he said without heat. \u201cLet me take care of you for once. Anyway, funeral homes can really fuck around with families, I\u2019ve been reading up on it, and, like, you know me, I refuse to get pushed around. I\u2019m gonna open with \u2018this is a Folgers can with a lid, legally you have to do it if we tell you too,\u2019 and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d\nDespite himself, Steve laughed. If there was a bit of wetness to it, Eddie was kind enough not to comment. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Hopper wants.\u201d\n\u201cHe told me he wants his body tossed into the woods,\u201d Eddie said flatly. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t even want us to stop the truck. Just fucking launch him out the back of the cab while we\u2019re doing sixty and keep going.\u201d\nSteve laughed again and tipped his head, just slightly, towards Eddie. \u201cWell, that sounds  wildly  illegal.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you think he asked me?\u201d he said. He leaned forward too. \u201cYou can see why I\u2019m going with the Folgers thing, though, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, no, totally makes sense now.\u201d\n\u201cI thought so.\u201d\nAnd, as their voices faded out between them, between one breath and the next, they fell asleep.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs  i\u2019m not angry anymore your most personal album? It feels very personal.\u201d\nLevy tears his pastry into small pieces, pops a few in his mouth and chews thoughtfully. At length, he says, \u201cIn a way. Everything I write is personal, some of it more than others, you know? I think, if I\u2019m being honest, and I try to be very honest with myself these days \u2014 if I\u2019m being honest, I think the most personal thing I ever wrote was  Girl with a Buzzcut (Reprise).\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d think,\u201d I say, \u201cthat it\u2019d be  I Wore His Jacket.\u201d\n\u201cAh, the great public coming out song.\u201d He shoots me a wry smile. \u201cNot that everyone got it right away. That\u2019s what you get for having a reputation as a  story teller  or whatever pretentious bull it is people like to call me sometimes. Don\u2019t get me wrong: that was, in fact, a fucking doozy. I was scared as hell to put that one out into the world, and to make it the first single? I\u2019ve got some brass ones, huh?\u201d\nWe each laugh, but I have to ask: \u201cYou think the Girl\u2019s reprise is more personal than that?\u201d\nHe waves a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole thing. But yeah, I do. I think I tell a very specific story in that song, different from  Jacket,  and that\u2019s, you know \u2014  Jacket  is a love story, but it doesn\u2019t have a happy ending. It\u2019s bittersweet. The Girl\u2019s reprise has a happy ending. I think that\u2019s the story I really wanted to tell. The Girl, you know, realizing that she isn\u2019t a monster, and that she\u2019s deserving of love\u2014 that she can  want  love, that she\u2019ll be okay. I suppose  i\u2019m not angry anymore  does something similar. the songs  no heroics  and  anthems for a twenty year old boy  certainly does \u2014 it tells you that, despite everything, you\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\u2014  Excerpted from \u201cWhen the Levy Breaks,\u201d Rolling Stone, December 1998 \n\n\n\n\nSlowly, Steve swam towards consciousness. It took a moment for his brain to come back online, which was strange, for him. Since he was sixteen and had learned there was another world beneath this one, he almost always snapped straight awake, engines firing on all cylinders and working on his anxiety disorder \u2014 like last night, when he\u2019d felt pressure on the edge of the bed and came to swinging even though there was no house safer than one with El Hopper, massively pregnant or not, under the roof.\nHe was, objectively, a terrible sleeper. Even before all the Upside Down bullshit, he\u2019d had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Lots of old girlfriends had complained he never spent the night but he\u2019d always been too restless in someone else's home, and if he was at his, he just decamped to the pool and sat beside it. That had lost its appeal shortly after the fall of \u201883, and his insomnia had only gotten worse then too. These days, his nightmares were few and far between but he still spent a lot of time watching QVC, or reruns of the Golden Girls at three in the morning.\nSo this slow, gentle waking, feeling well rested and like he could slip right back under, was strange. He tried to put his finger on what was different; he remembered being in the car with Dustin, saying goodnight to El, and then falling asleep and, yes, waking again. Eddie had been there, he recalled; they\u2019d talked about the kids and Hopper and Eddie\u2019s writing and then Steve had fallen asleep. Now?\nNow, he was warm, cocooned with the blankets and spooned against a heat source that he was slowly beginning to realize was Eddie. They must\u2019ve rolled together in their sleep; and, now Eddie was curved against his back, his face pressed between Steve\u2019s shoulder blades, a leg between his thighs, and one hand spread against his abdomen. Neither of them had on shirts, skin to warm skin. Heartbeat rabbiting, he realized that Eddie\u2019s fingers were skimming the waistband of his briefs.\nFuck.\nOh,  fuck, he thought, this was \u2014\u00a0\nThis was \u2014\u00a0\nHis eyes burned. This was everything he\u2019d ever wanted, and it was so clearly some kind of sleepy mistake \u2014 how did he get out without breaking his own heart into a million pieces in the process?\nSteve closed his eyes tightly, sucking in a breath between his teeth and allowed himself one moment of weakness. He allowed himself that, just one brief, perfect moment of fantasy: that this was every morning, that this was his life, tucked in the hollow of Eddie\u2019s body like a parenthetical, so close you couldn\u2019t slot a coin between them. That, like this, Eddie\u2019s breathing would change, speed up with waking; that, like this, his mouth would press softly and sweetly to the ridges of Steve\u2019s spine; that, like this, his sleep warm hand would slip beneath elastic of his briefs; that, like this, he would take Steve in hand.\n\u201cBaby,\u201d Eddie said, voice raspy and low with just waking up, his fingers dipping low. His hips pushed forward, the hard length of him pressing into Steve, and instinctively he pushed back, wanting, and \u2014\nWait \u2014\nThat wasn\u2019t \u2014\n\u201cShit  \u2014 \u201d\nThis was \u2014\nBehind him, Eddie shot up and backwards like he\u2019d been burned. Steve sat up too, turning in time to see Eddie topple off the edge of the bed in a flurry of sheets and flailing arms.\nFor one second, a lifetime, they just sort of stared at each other. Steve\u2019s heart felt like it was going to beat out of his chest. He opened his mouth to say something just as Eddie scrambled up onto his hands and knees and said, \u201cFuck. Fuck, Steve, I am so sorry. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I thought I was \u2014 I would have  never touched you, if I\u2019d \u2014 without \u2014 I was \u2014 I thought I was dreaming and \u2014  fuck \u2014 \u201d\nWhat?\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2014 what? It\u2019s okay.\u201d\nEddie stared at him, eyes huge. \u201cWhat? Steve, I fucking felt you up, I\u2019m so sorry \u2014 \u201d\nHe\u2019d thought it\u2019d be harder, was the thing. He thought it was going to be some sort of huge emotional upheaval, but it wasn\u2019t, he realized. He thought, if he ever managed to tell Eddie how he felt, that it would destroy him, destroy them both. But it was just them, together in this bedroom in the attic of the house built by the only man Steve ever thought of as his father. His family was under this roof, and Eddie was under this roof, and Eddie was the one looking at him like he had fucked up by touching Steve.\nSteve thought about what Joyce had said to him, sitting side by side with him on this bed, god, just two days ago. Grief and growth, he thought.\n\u201cI love you,\u201d said Steve, and, at once, it was easier and harder than he thought it would be. He\u2019d never managed to say the words to anyone, after he\u2019d said them to Nancy in that bathroom at that party, too terrified of what someone would say back. But this was him, and it was Eddie, and it was them, in Hopper\u2019s attic.\nEddie was frozen on the ground still. His hands were fisted in the sheets near Steve\u2019s calf. His eyes \u2014\u00a0\n\u201cI love you,\u201d he said again. \u201cI\u2019ve loved you since we were twenty and you tossed your jacket at my head and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to stop loving you, is the thing, and I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve crossed some wires but I don\u2019t think I have, and I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019ve been scared, I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m a runner, and maybe we should have done this earlier, and I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t, I was too fucking scared, but I\u2019m not scared anymore and I have to tell you now, because \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cSteve \u2014 \u201c\n\u201c \u2014 because it doesn\u2019t matter, because I can love you now with, with more of myself. With my new self. I\u2019m not sad that something\u2019s ended, because there\u2019s something new, and I love you, I\u2019ll love you, I\u2019m sorry \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cSteve \u2014 \u201c\n\u201cI still have your jacket,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s palm was cupped along his jaw now, the one with the stick and poke eye he\u2019d done himself right after everything. He\u2019d had it cleaned up a few years later, Steve knew, had them scrawl  the devil won\u2019t keep till morning  below. People always thought it was after his song, but the sentiment came first. They\u2019d known their fair share of devils over the years, some of them human, most of them not.\nSteve wasn\u2019t sure if Eddie had reached out first, or if Steve had leaned in, but they were so close suddenly. He said, \u201cI still have it.\u201d\nEddie kissed him, thorough and slow and beautiful and filthy, his tongue behind his teeth. Steve felt flayed open, vulnerable, and he wanted to crawl into him, live inside of him, never let him go. His hands tangled in Eddie\u2019s hair as they kissed for what felt like forever, Eddie on his knees at the edge of the bed, Steve bent in half to reach him.\n\u201cI wrote every single one of them for you,\u201d Eddie told him an eternity later. Their parted mouths were still so close together it was like he was feeding the words to him. He pulled back, ran his thumbs along the hollows of Steve\u2019s eyes, dear, and said, \u201cEvery love song, every  song,  every word \u2014 Steve, I wrote them all for you.\u201d\nOh, he thought.\n\u201cEddie,\u201d he said. \u201cKiss me again. Please.\u201d\nHe did, and everything felt slow and fast all at once. Eddie was on the bed again, leaning over Steve, crowding him back against the pillows, and Steve was spreading his thighs, opening up the cradle of his hips for Eddie to make a home for himself. His hands were still tangled in Eddie\u2019s soft hair, and Eddie\u2019s fingers were pressing on the hinge of his jaw, encouraging. He licked into his mouth, soft, exploratory, and Steve held the moan that wanted to escape in his throat like a secret.\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that. I wanna hear you.\u201d\n\u201cThe kids \u2014 \u201d\n\u201c\u2014 aren\u2019t kids anymore. But we\u2019ll be quiet, if you want.\u201d Eddie\u2019s other hand was back on the elastic band of Steve\u2019s briefs. He was hard again, so hard, and he could feel Eddie hard against his thigh too. He breathed into his mouth, \u201cIs this okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Steve said. \u201cFuck, more than okay. Eddie, Eddie \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got you, baby.\u201d He slipped Steve\u2019s briefs down his legs, his own following before Steve even had to ask, and then they were moving together in the half-light of the attic. Eddie was so hot against him, like a brand. His mouth trailed down Steve\u2019s neck, licking into the hollow of his collarbone, and he thought he was going to explode.\n\u201cEddie, Eddie,\u201d he said, like a mantra.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asked, mouthing at Steve\u2019s pectoral. \u201cI want \u2014 I want to give you everything.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. This, anything, everything.\u201d He wasn\u2019t making sense, but he didn\u2019t care. It was him. It was  Eddie. \u201cJust \u2014 don\u2019t stop touching me. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\u201cI could never,\u201d Eddie said. He kissed his way down Steve\u2019s sternum, across the thick scarring of his abdomen, down into the dips of his hips, slow and thorough as that first kiss had been, and then kissed back up the way he came when Steve tugged gently at his hair. He asked, \u201cDo you want me to fuck you?\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said. Nothing had ever sounded better to Steve, in fact, and he told him so.\nEddie huffed a laugh, pressed that laugh into his mouth as he kissed him, and then slipped off him to go to his bag. Steve sat up and watched him go, the confidence in his nude body as he bent to rummage through his bag, the strong line of his back, his shoulders, the curve of his round ass. Steve wanted to bite it, wanted to run his hands across the breadth of him, memorize his tattoos with his fingers and not just his eyes, clutch him tight and never let go.\nTurning back to him, the unruly shag of Eddie\u2019s hair covered half his face in shadow. \u201cWhat are you smiling at?\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d he said. \u201cCome back.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d he said. He walked back slowly, his hard dick, thicker than Steve\u2019s but not as long, bouncing against his thigh, and he crawled back over Steve, a condom and a sachet of lube in his right fist.\n\u201cThat confident you\u2019d get lucky?\u201d Steve asked, as Eddie ripped the sachet open.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t hurt to be prepared,\u201d he said, his slick fingers pressing at the apex of Steve\u2019s body. \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t hear you complaining.\u201d\nSteve wasn\u2019t, and he didn\u2019t. He had taken any number of lovers into his bed over the years, and had quite a lot of great sex too, but this was different. This was Eddie, and Eddie took his time, staring into his eyes the whole time, watching his face carefully for any twitch, any wince, any sign of discomfort or hesitation \u2014 for any flutter of his eyes, or the bite of his lip. He was, Steve realized,  learning  his body, like an instrument, like something that Eddie was planning on playing for years to come.  Let me take care of you for once, he\u2019d said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re smiling again,\u201d said Eddie, softly.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\nHe wiped his hand on the sheets and carefully opened the condom, and Steve gently took it from him.\n\u201cLet me,\u201d he said. Steve rolled the condom on. \u201cCan I get on top? I wanna ride you.\u201d\n\u201cFuck.\u201d Eyes huge, breathless, Eddie nodded. \u201cSure, baby.\u201d\nSteve flipped them and sank down in one fluid motion. Somehow, impossibly, Eddie\u2019s eyes blew even wider and Steve set a slow but punishing pace for them, riding Eddie steadily but surely into the mattress.\n\u201cJesus Christ, look at you,\u201d he breathed. \u201cSteve, sweetheart, look at you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d he said. \u201cLike what you see?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked what I saw,\u201d Eddie told him. This, for some reason, made Steve duck his head, and Eddie reached up a hand, the tattooed one, tilting his face up. \u201cDon\u2019t hide from me. Please. I want to see you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want to see?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cThis. Anything,\u201d he echoed. \u201cEverything.\u201d\nSomehow, eventually, they were on their sides again, Eddie curled over Steve\u2019s back like they had woken barely an hour ago, Eddie thrusting in and out of Steve\u2019s body, his mouth over the scars on Steve\u2019s neck, saying quietly in between kisses and bites, \u201cSteve, baby, sweetheart, my love.\u201d He felt electric, a stripped wire, and he wanted so badly for this moment to never end. But he wanted to feel him, too, feel Eddie lose control, wanted to have a part of him in him always, and he was on fire, immolated from the inside out, so he said, \u201cEddie, babe, please, please, I need you \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, hips snapping furiously, his hand fisting around Steve in time. \u201cYes, yes \u2014 \u201d\nAfter, they stood at the foot of the bed together, slowly dressing one another. Eddie smoothed back Steve\u2019s hair, his fingers sliding down to the nape of his neck, and Steve buckled the belt on Eddie\u2019s jeans. He leaned in and kissed him on the corner of his mouth, and Eddie ran the backs of his knuckles from his jaw to his shoulder to his hand.\n\u201cHey,\u201d said Steve.\n\u201cHey,\u201d said Eddie. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause \u2014 you and me forever, is what I mean.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Steve told him.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nEddie beamed. \u201cBreakfast?\u201d\nHe took his hand and, together, they walked down the stairs. They dropped each other\u2019s hands as they approached, after Steve squeezed once, and they went into the kitchen where Hopper was having coffee with Mike and Jonathan.\n\u201cEddie!\u201d called Mike. \u201cHey, man, when did you get in?\u201d\n\u201cLate last night,\u201d he told him, heading over to the coffee pot in the corner. Steve followed him over; he was going to have to go on another run soon, that old thing was really putting in overtime. Eddie was saying, \u201cWill let me in.\u201d\n\u201cHow was your flight?\u201d asked Jonathan.\n\u201cEh,\u201d he said. He poured Steve a cup of coffee and then one for himself. Eddie smiled softly at him, took a sip.\n\u201cMunson. Harrington.\u201d\nThey turned sharply.\nAt the kitchen table, Hopper was giving them the hairy eyeball; it was as powerful as it was when Steve was fifteen and illegally joy riding the Beemer down dirt roads in Hawkins while his parents were out of town, undiminished by time and Hopper\u2019s own fading body. Steve liked to think he\u2019d become immune to it, though, a son to Hop as much as the Byers boys were, as much as El was his daughter, but he could feel Eddie shrinking behind his shoulders. Hopper demanded flatly, \u201cYou two fuck in my attic?\u201d\nBehind him, Eddie choked on his coffee. Steve stared Hopper right back in the eye, despite the fact that he was desperately trying to figure out if he had a visible hickey or something. He didn\u2019t think so but Eddie had, true to character, proven to be delightfully bitey. It could really go either way.\n\u201cWhat about it, chief,\u201d he said.\nEddie made another strangled noise, clearly trying to will his body through the floor.\nHopper grumbled, but there was a smile lurking at the edges of his mouth. \u201cJust wash your own sheets.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d asked Mike. His eyes darted back and forth between Eddie, Steve, and Hopper. Jonathan leaned back in his chair, smirking. Mike demanded, \u201cWait, did you guys finally figure your shit out? You  banged?  In the  house?\u201d\nSteve liked to be the bigger person these days, when it came to the kids \u2014 he was a grown ass man, after all \u2014 but if Mike was going to leave him an opening like that\u2026\n\u201cGuest bath too,\u201d he said.\nMike flung his hands up. \u201cDude! That\u2019s a shared fucking space, what is  wrong  with you?\u201d He pointed an accusatory finger at Eddie, adding, \u201cAnd you! I gave  you  a  kidney, and this is how you repay me?\u201d\nEddie shrugged his shoulders and made an apologetic face, despite the furious blush that was streaked across his cheeks and turning the tips of his ears bright red. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen those freckles. I\u2019m weak!\u201d\n\u201cYou guys  suck,\u201d  he hissed.\n\u201cI sure did,\u201d said Steve.\nWith an inarticulate noise of rage, Mike\u2019s chair screeched backwards and he stormed out of the room. Steve chortled to himself, leaning back into Eddie, and caught the edge of Hopper\u2019s smirk before he took a sip of his coffee.\n\u201cIgnore him,\u201d offered El. She\u2019d wandered in just as Hopper had begun his interrogation and was now doing something unspeakable with an Eggo and a jar of sauerkraut. \u201cHe is just upset because now he owes Lucas money.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Wheeler! Get back here! Did you assholes bet on me?\u201d Steve shouted.\n\u201cFrom the bottom of my heart, kid,\u201d said Hopper, \u201cyou deserve this, and I\u2019m thrilled it\u2019s happening. Munson, you and I are gonna talk later.\u201d\nBehind him, Eddie nodded stiffly. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\nLater still, after Robin and Madchen had arrived and Steve had held Robin for a long time in the kitchen, wordlessly, tucked into each other like little kids; after Robin had taken one look at, yeah, the enormous hickey Eddie had in fact left behind beneath the Y of the scar on Steve\u2019s neck and laughed so hard she told him she might be sick and Madchen had just high-fived him; after Hopper dragged Eddie into his study for a talk that Steve suspected Hopper had been perfecting for the better part of two decades \u2014\u00a0\nLater still, Steve caught the boys and Max, crowded around the back of the old dairy parlor, on his way to his car for that emergency coffee run at Kroger. Will had a notebook open in one hand and a fanny pack worn crossways across his body that he was digging in with the other, rifling through a truly alarming amount of cash. He was handing out a handful of bills to each Dustin and Max but the lion\u2019s share of the cash was going to Lucas, who was crowing, \u201cI told you I knew Steve best!\u201d\u00a0\nMike glared. \u201cEat dirt, Sinclair.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s still unanswered questions,\u201d Dustin was saying. \u201cFor instance, we don\u2019t know  definitively who made the first move \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cEl said Eddie kissed him first,\u201d Max said, counting out her wad of fives and tens before handing them to Lucas to put in his wallet. \u201cShe said he was thinking about it super loud.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but who  confessed,\u201d he said. \u201cWho broke down first? Did Eddie tell him he wanted to go get gay married in the Netherlands? Did Steve tell him he loved him and wants to have lots of sex and babies?\u201d\n\u201cDude, gross,\u201d said Mike.\nDustin rolled his eyes. \u201cOh, shut the fuck up, you homophobic piece of shit \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cI am not homophobic, you shut the fuck up, just because I don\u2019t wanna imagine our dads bumping uglies \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cThose babies would be cute,\u201d said Max contemplatively as Dustin and Mike dissolved into a slap fight.\n\u201cGreat hair,\u201d agreed Lucas. \u201cBig hair.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m still holding three hundred in the pot,\u201d Will offered, \u201cfor the over/under on who says I love you  first, and another two hundred for a proposal. I can add a thing about the big-haired babies but as the resident homosexual of the Party Proper, I can tell you, it\u2019s probably not gonna happen.\u201d\n\u201cProbably?\u201d asked Lucas.\n\u201cMutants. Also seahorses do it, and how would you know if you, like, had a secondary mutation for it unless you tried?\u201d called Dustin. He now had Mike in a headlock and seemed poised to give him a wet willy but paused as he watched Lucas visibly weigh that information.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it  would  be the weirdest thing to happen to us yet, but, like \u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot  ever,\u201d finished Will.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d whispered Steve, backing away. He wanted no part of this.\nStill, he did tell Eddie about it later, as they brought Mike\u2019s nightmare to fruition in the guest bathroom.\n\u201cWill\u2019s running book on us,\u201d he said. Eddie made an inquisitive noise from between Steve\u2019s legs. He told him, \u201cApparently there\u2019s, shit, there\u2019s an open bet on which one of us says I love you first and there\u2019s a lot of money on it. Shit. I mean, like, a lot of money.\u201d\n\u201cDamn,\u201d said Eddie, a little breathless. \u201cI always knew that kid was a genius. Do you know who has you? If it\u2019s Max, I bet we can talk her into splitting the profit if we make it worth her while. Now, as interesting as this is, can we stop talking about the gremlins? I\u2019ve got big plans down here, you know?\u201d\nSteve laughed. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nEddie shot him a wicked smile and ducked his head back down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d live past twenty, you know?\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s wild to me that I\u2019m here, genuinely wild. I was supposed to be  dead. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019ve got such a connection to it. Because I thought there was this thing \u2014 you know, the classic rock star  thing  \u2014 and it was supposed to, fucking,  eat me alive. But here I am, and there I was, with my heroes shaking my hand, and I\u2019m never getting over it, you know? Never, ever, ever. Can you imagine? That\u2019s, like, I think the heart of  METALHEAD. Maybe that\u2019s what makes it so metal: surviving when you shouldn\u2019t, and making a life for yourself after.\u201d\n\u2014  Excerpted from \u201cFortune Favors the Fuck-Ups,\u201d Spin, June 1992 \n\n\n\n\nDespite what they were all waiting for, life went on on the farm, each of them orbiting each other, waiting, one day at a time. Eddie had had a medical marijuana card since they made it legal in Seattle in \u201898 \u2014 \u201cIf anyone asks,\u201d he said, \u201cI have glaucoma\u201d \u2014 and he smoked Hopper out in his office most afternoons, the two of them having quickly gotten over whatever shovel talk Hopper had given. Hopper began spending more time asleep than not too, and they all just \u2014 waited.\nMax took a few sessions with her clients over the phone and Lucas did an interview on his cell seated on the fence of the old cow pasture, had a long call with Nike one morning while the rest of them watched from the kitchen window, fingers crossed. Dustin had brought his traveling equipment and entertained Barbie and Scott with it, dubbing them his assistants; Mike and Will also got involved, and there was one afternoon filled with explosions that took about two years off Steve\u2019s life. Nancy and Jonathan kept Joyce company when she wasn\u2019t tending to Hopper, and Robin and Madchen had taken over all kitchen related duties, the best cooks of them all. Will and El could often be found at Hopper\u2019s bedside, El growing rounder and rounder with every passing day and Will reading the draft of his newest book aloud, making edits as he went.\nEddie often disappeared in the afternoons after his daily bowl with Hopper. He would go off to the old dairy parlor to write; Hopper and Joyce had never been able to agree on what it should get turned into, had just gutted most of the equipment and then bickered about whether it should become a guest house or maybe a studio for Will when he visited. The acoustics were good, either way, said Eddie, and he could often be found there or in the guest bath with his guitar.\nHim and Steve screwed most nights, making out like teenagers like they were making up for lost time, shushing each other if they got too loud, aware now that the acoustics in the attic weren\u2019t too shabby either. Mostly, Eddie fucked him slow and deep and right, always staring into his eyes or kissing the space beneath the hinge of his jaw, and Steve\u2019s heart felt like it might explode, so full.\nSteve ended up the runner of the group, an extension of his duties as gopher for El\u2019s pregnancy cravings. Usually, someone came along with him, one of the kids most of the time, looking for a reprieve, looking for a shoulder to cry on where no one could see them break down. Steve didn\u2019t mind; the times when he was alone, he found himself in tears behind the wheel, terrible sobs clawing their way up his throat.\nHe started leaving his Blackberry behind when he went during the second week, no matter if someone was with him or he was alone. So far, Jonathan was the only person who\u2019d either clocked it or decided to mention it at all. They were on their way to pick up ingredients for a new recipe Robin wanted to try \u2014 she was on a vegan kick, and needed a shit ton of chickpeas \u2014 and Jonathan waited until they were buckled into Hopper\u2019s truck and heading down the dirt driveway to speak.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said softly, \u201cyou left your Blackberry \u2014 don\u2019t you think we should bring it?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Steve turned onto the street, shot Jonathan a look from the corner of his eye. \u201cDo you want to find out your step-dad died in the frozen food aisle of a Kroger?\u201d\nJonathan huffed a laugh, or maybe a sob. \u201cYeah. Yeah, that\u2019s fair.\u201d\nOne week, then, and two, and then another, and, in the end, they got a whole month. It was longer than they thought they would get and somehow, of course, not long enough indeed.\nSteve had been sent on yet another horrific food run for El, two weeks out from her due date now and clearly over the entire thing. If Eddie didn\u2019t drag him to bed, he spent most of his nights side by side with El at the kitchen table. He was going to join her there now, locking up his car, and when he entered it was to Hopper at the table with her, their heads bent together. Joyce was at the kitchen sink, washing dishes for something to do.\n\u201cHey,\u201d said Hopper, looking up Steve put the absolute horror El requested from the local Dairy Queen on the table in front of her. \u201cMission accomplished?\u201d\n\u201cBarely,\u201d said Steve. \u201cThe looks the people in town give me now. I\u2019m a pariah!\u201d\nEl stuck her tongue out at him. Hopper said, \u201cYou talk a big game for someone who will never know the beautiful nightmare of pregnancy.\u201d\n\u201cI mean, not for lack of trying on Eddie\u2019s part,\u201d said Steve. \u201cHe really puts his back into it, you know?\u201d\nEl snorted into her DQ abomination and Joyce rolled her eyes so hard it was practically audible. \u201cSteve. \u201d\n\u201cListen!\u201d He held his hands out, palms open. \u201cHe just wants to make sure you get a grand baby from each kid, and apparently there\u2019s a bet going around about whether or not I want to have his big-haired babies. And I do, so.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m telling Mike,\u201d said El.\n\u201cDo it. And make sure I\u2019m there, I wanna see what color his face turns.\u201d\n\u201cThis is perfect, huh, Joyce? All of our babies, here, home,\u201d said Hopper then, and they all turned to look at him. He was smiling, wry and soft and strained, tired. He looked so genuinely happy and it was startling \u2014 sometimes, Steve thought he could only count on one hand the times he\u2019d seen Hopper actually happy, not just content or fine. As he slowly rose from his seat, Steve felt his eyes well up with tears, and Hopper said, \u201cBut I think it\u2019s time for me to turn in.\u201d\nHe shuffled to stand behind them, kissed El on the temple, cradled his boney hand against the bottom curve of Steve\u2019s skull, and said, \u201cBe good, okay?\u201d\nAt the sink, Joyce dried her hands off. She moved silently but quickly to Hopper\u2019s side, tucking herself beneath his arm, her thin shoulders holding him up as they always did.\n\u201cHere, honey,\u201d she said. She turned to smile softly at him and El, said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u201d and steered Hopper from the room.\n\u201cHey, I should take you out for dinner soon,\u201d said Hopper.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d said Joyce. \u201cLike a date?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, like a date,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ll pencil it in.\u201d\nIn the kitchen, him and El sat quietly for a moment, listening as their voices faded and their soft steps retreated to the stairs and then upwards. El put her spoon on the table with a clink.\n\u201cSteve?\u201d she asked, voice small.\nHe blinked hard once, twice, and then stood. It seemed to him like it took monumental effort, like his body was on the verge of collapsing in on itself, and he forced some steel into his spine. He held a hand out to El.\u00a0 \u201cHey, let\u2019s get you to bed too, okay? It\u2019s late and Mike\u2019s probably about to round up the troops to find you.\u201d\nThose too-old eyes of hers searched his face; for what, he\u2019d never be sure, but after a moment she nodded and let herself be led from the room. He dropped her off at her bedroom and watched carefully from the doorway as she laid herself down on her side, Mike curling unconsciously around her in his sleep. She gave him another nod and he closed the door, moving to the back stairwell that led to the attic.\nEddie was in bed but still awake, writing steadily in his notebook. He looked up when Steve hit the final stair, the creaky one, and his quick smile turned into a frown.\n\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know. Can I just, like, hold you for a little bit?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d He shut the notebook, put it on the side table in one fluid motion, and Steve stepped out of his jeans and tossed his t-shirt in the general direction of the dresser. Wordlessly, Eddie flipped back the duvet and he dropped into him, pressing his face into his sternum and wrapping his arms around his torso. One of Eddie\u2019s hands carded through Steve\u2019s hair while the other reached for the light and Steve listened to the reassuring rhythm of both their hearts.\nHe didn\u2019t even realize they fell asleep like that, Eddie still sitting and Steve buried into him like an animal looking for warmth, until he startled awake to the feel of a cold hand on his bicep. Only Eddie\u2019s grip on him kept him from flailing out wildly and he blinked rapidly, trying to see into the dim half-light of the attic in morning. The sun never made it in until well after noon, and he couldn\u2019t get a clear look at the clock.\n\u201cDustin?\u201d asked Eddie, voice hazy.\nSteve raised his head and sure enough there the kid was, kneeling by the side of the bed. His hair was wild and there were tears streaming down his face, his hand spasming on Steve\u2019s arm. He said,\u00a0 \u201cHopper\u2019s gone.\u201d\nHe sat up on his elbows. He looked from Dustin to Eddie, whose mouth had dropped open, and then back to Dustin, still crouched on the ground.\u00a0\n\u201cHe just \u2014 didn\u2019t wake up this morning,\u201d he was saying, voice thick and watery, \u201cand he\u2019s gone. He\u2019s just \u2014 he\u2019s really gone this time. Isn\u2019t he? Hopper\u2019s gone.\u201d\nSteve sat up, moving off Eddie\u2019s legs, and opened his arms. Dustin fell into them, weeping. Steve pressed his cheek against his brother\u2019s head, felt Eddie move beside him to sit up and wrap them both in his own long arms, and began to cry.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRarely does Levy discuss his hometown, his childhood. In most interviews, he rushes past the question with a joke. In his most iconic \u2014 the aptly titled \u201898 issue of Rolling Stone, \u201cWhen the Levy Breaks\u201d \u2014 he got more personal. It was, he says, a common story for someone like him: a broken home and a drug problem, trailer trash just like the first track off his first album.\nBut now, sitting across from me, in the midst of the worst writer\u2019s block of his career, he confesses, \u201cI\u2019m worried I\u2019ll never write another song again.\u201d\nOh?\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He reaches out, presses one hand to the window of the recording booth. There\u2019s a startling longing on his face; I feel, suddenly, like a voyeur. He tells me, \u201cMaybe this is it for me. I don\u2019t know. I wonder, sometimes, if I\u2019m being punished.\u201d\nPunished?\n\u201cChrissy\u2019s Song,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople always ask me: what\u2019s it about, really? As if what it is on the surface wasn\u2019t enough. A girl in trouble, a girl needing help, and not getting it. What she got was me, and sometimes I wonder if I\u2019m being punished for failing her. I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t talk about this. About her, that night. Rightfully. You know, there\u2019s a whole town of people who think I murdered her. Do you wanna hear a ghost story?\u201d\n\u2014  Excerpted from \u201cWhen Suffering Grows a Garden, Set It On Fire,\u201d Fader, March 2001 \n\n\n\nSteve\u2019s most enduring memory of his father was this: at a dinner table, reading the paper, asking him about his day and then not listening to the answer. He was ten, in the memory, and even then some part of him recognized that the man before him may have been his father but he was also a stranger. Like with many things, he didn\u2019t have the words to articulate the feeling until much later in life, but it had been a certain sadness then stuck beneath his breastbone, a kind of loneliness that no ten year old should know.\nHis most enduring memory of Hopper was this: Steve, seventeen years old, beat to shit on Joyce Byers\u2019s sofa, Hopper pressing butterfly bandages over his nose, asking, \u201cYou sure you won\u2019t let me take you to the hospital, kid,\u201d and Steve shaking his head even though it made him want to puke and cry all at the same time.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he told him.\nHopper arched a skeptical brow and said, \u201cAnd I\u2019m the Queen of England.\u201d\nAt Steve\u2019s other side on the couch, the super-powered little girl with the dark eye make-up was leaning against his side and she giggled. Hopper continued, \u201cIf I can\u2019t take you to the hospital, and you won\u2019t press charges, you\u2019re coming home with us so I can make sure you don\u2019t slip into a fu\u2014tzing coma in your sleep, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay.\u201d He rose, wiping his hands on his pants, and pointed to the girl. \u201cEl, poke him every five minutes when we get into the car. Hard.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said too.\nHopper dropped a hand into Steve\u2019s hair then, not ruffling, mindful, obviously, of how concussed he in fact was. He looked at him steadily and, even if Steve saw two of him there for a minute and was getting a little concerned about his own brain, he knew what he saw in Hopper\u2019s eyes just then. It was the first time, that night, but it wasn\u2019t the last: it was a man who was a stranger but also a father.\nOr, perhaps, no, it wasn\u2019t that, and instead  this  was his most enduring memory of Hopper: Steve \u2014 nineteen years old, stitches across his abdomen and the y-shaped marks on his neck, a pint of someone else\u2019s blood in his veins, and an IV-drip in his wrist, sitting next to Eddie Munson\u2019s hospital bed and praying to a god he didn\u2019t know if he still believed in that he and Max, two doors down, were going to wake up \u2014 looking up to see a dead man in the doorway.\nSteve was tired and bloody and dirty and he\u2019d been holding it together with white knuckled hands for the better part of a year; and Hopper, thin and grim, cracked a smile and said, \u201cHey, kid. Heard you had kind of a week too.\u201d\nHe burst into tears. It wasn\u2019t a pretty cry, either; no, it was full-on ugly, gasping, snotty sobs, Steve clawing at his own mouth to keep the terrible wounded animal noises at bay. He heard, as if from a great distance, someone say, \u201cOh, bud,\u201d and then there were big arms around him. He collapsed into the hug, burrowing his face into Hopper\u2019s now boney shoulder, his whole body shaking. He smelled like sweat and the woods and peanut butter and cigarettes. He was warm. He was maybe shaking a little too.\nHopper was alive, Hopper was here \u2014 Hopper was  alive, Hopper was  here  \u2014\nWith one hand cupped against the back of Steve\u2019s head, he used the other to rub circles between his shoulder blades and, between gasping sobs, Steve said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry, I tried, Hopper, I tried \u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said. His lips were pressed against Steve\u2019s temple, chapped and peeling, and he was so real and warm and he couldn\u2019t stop fucking shaking. Hopper said, \u201cI know, son, I know you did.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t keep them safe,\u201d he sobbed.\n\u201cBut you kept them alive,\u201d he told him. \u201cYou did so good, kid. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he gasped. \u201cDad \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Hopper said again. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here now, son. You kept them alive, and I\u2019ll keep you safe. It\u2019s gonna be okay. I\u2019ve got you. You can rest now, son. I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJB: I have to ask, your song,  An Unhaunted House  \u2014 it\u2019s so evocative, that idea, that you present, there. What made you think of it?\nEL: What? That there\u2019s no such thing as an unhaunted house?\nJB: Yeah.\nEL: Because there\u2019s not. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the first to have this idea. Look, it\u2019s like: your body, it\u2019s a home, it\u2019s your home, your vessel. But you live inside of it, and your memories live inside of it, and those are ghosts. There\u2019s always a ghost, metaphorical or otherwise. There\u2019s this poem, by Merrit Malloy, and I think about it a lot. I heard it a few years ago at a funeral, right before they did the Kaddish. So, there\u2019s this part, goes like: \u201cI want to leave you something, something better than words, or sounds. Look for me in the people I\u2019ve known or loved, and if you cannot give me away, at least let me live in your eyes and not your mind.\u201d She says it so much better than me, but I think that\u2019s what I wanted to get at with  An Unhaunted House . That it\u2019s there. It follows you, good or bad. \u201cLove doesn\u2019t die, people do.\u201d There\u2019s no such thing as an unhaunted house. It\u2019s just a matter of how the haunting takes you.\n\u2014  Excerpted from \u201cEd Levy Wants You To Get High And Listen To Kate Bush,\u201d Mojo, July 1997 \n\n\n\nHopper was cremated. They didn\u2019t put his ashes in a Folgers\u2019 can, even though Hopper had found it objectively hilarious and had given Eddie his blessing to do so, saying if they wouldn\u2019t bury him in the backyard, he found that alternative solution acceptable. Instead, it was a tasteful wooden box. They scattered half of his ashes over little Sarah\u2019s grave in a small, private ceremony, and then a few days later took the rest up to Hawkins to toss over the quarry.\nA priest spoke and Joyce delivered a dry-eyed eulogy that made everyone else cry, her hands steady around the wooden box that held him; but Steve didn\u2019t remember any of that. He remembered, instead, the way Joyce\u2019s shoulders had been straight and firm and uncompromising. He remembered the warmth of the back of Eddie\u2019s hand, pressed against his own as they stood there, Dustin under Eddie\u2019s free arm and Max under Steve\u2019s. He remembered Robin crying into Madchen\u2019s shoulder and the quietly devastated expression on her face when he checked on her in the rearview of the car on the way over. He remembered the Byers boys holding hands, and he remembered El staring out over the quarry like she could see something none of the rest of them could see, like she could see something beyond them. Maybe she could.\nAfter, they held the wake at the farm. Steve stood on Joyce\u2019s left with El, and Will and Jonathan, Nancy and the kids too, on her right, all of them but El shaking hands and thanking people who told them they were sorry for their loss; she stood with her hands over the heavy swell of her belly and nodded. No one looked twice at Steve in the line up; Chief Powell, retired a few years back, even told him that Hop used to carry a picture of Steve in his wallet from his Indiana State graduation, would tell him about his son up in Chicago when they ran into each other after he left Hawkins.\nSteve had to look at the ceiling then, jaw clenched, just for a moment, before thanking him for stopping by.\nHe wished Eddie was by his side too, but he was rightfully keeping himself scarce. The old government cover-up and Lucas\u2019s inspired lie about WITSEC had done a lot for Eddie\u2019s image but people from Hawkins had a long memory and there were tons of them filtering in and out of the house to pay their respects and Eddie didn\u2019t want to disrupt an already difficult day. Steve thought he saw him slip into Hopper\u2019s office with Dustin at one point, an arm around his shoulders, Robin and Madchen with them. Either way, a T.Rex record was playing; it was one of the few artists Hopper and Eddie could agree on.\nSteve kept himself busy, in between, bringing water and food to Joyce and standing there until she put something in her stomach, rolling her eyes at his mothering of her.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t this be the other way around,\u201d she whispered to him once, pushing the hair out of his face.\n\u201cYou can give us one day,\u201d he told her as he and Jonathan and Will traded off a place at her side.\n\u201cJust one day,\u201d she told him.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I ask.\u201d\nA few hours in, he realized he\u2019d lost sight of El. The gathering had lost that awful edge of solemnity, laughter and jokes rising as people traded memories of Hopper, the T.Rex album louder, and a part of the Party had run out to gather more alcohol because Hopper would drag himself back from heaven itself to kick their asses if they threw him a dry funeral.\nHe tried to remember the last time he saw her. With Eddie, maybe, having emerged to drink a few beers in a kitchen with Max and Will, or with Mike before he\u2019d led the booze recon with Dustin, Lucas, and Max.\nShe wasn\u2019t in the kitchen with Eddie and Will, though, and she wasn\u2019t with Jonathan and Nancy around Joyce either, and so Steve quietly slipped out of the house and across the backyard to the old, empty dairy parlor. It was Hopper\u2019s favorite place to smoke, after Joyce had forbidden him from doing it in the house if he wasn\u2019t going to quit completely, and El was just standing in the middle of it, that far away look on her face.\nHe stepped softly but audibly over, not wanting to startle her, and she turned to look at him just so. She tucked a bit of her dark, curly hair behind her ear with one hand and Steve saw that the other was clutching a pack of Hop\u2019s old smokes between her breasts, against her heart. She\u2019d clearly been crying but not anymore, eyes red rimmed and face salt stained but dry.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHey.\u201d\nSteve stood at her side and she looked forward again into the nothingness of the dairy parlor. He asked, \u201cYou need anything?\nEl shook her head. He put his hands in his pockets.\nAt length, she held out the cigarettes to Steve.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a lighter,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere is one in the box,\u201d she told him.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cOne last one for the old man, huh?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said.\nHe shook a cigarette out and lit it. El watched him carefully and he blew the smoke away from her, wanting to take a step back, but she closed her eyes and sniffed the air gently. She smiled.\n\u201cI don\u2019t miss him yet,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has been days. Is that strange?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not strange. I think I\u2019ve been missing him for a long time before he was gone.\u201d\nShe looked at him quizzically.\nSteve shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can explain it.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not have to,\u201d she said.\nHe thought for a moment, took a final drag of the cigarette and then just let it burn out in between his thumb and forefinger, and settled on, \u201cGrief\u2019s different for everybody. I think I\u2019ve been grieving him since he told me, even if I kept making plans for us. We were supposed to see a baseball game last week. I don\u2019t know. I think I missed him even when he was still here because what we have \u2014\u00a0 what we had was different now. I think maybe he knew that, and he tried to, to give us everything of himself that he had left to give.\u201d\n\u201cBut what we had was good,\u201d said El.\n\u201cThe best,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s okay if that hurts.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t miss him yet,\u201d said Steve slowly. \u201cMaybe you won\u2019t ever miss him not \u2014 not like you think you should, I mean. Because you\u2019ve still got his love. We all still have his love. Whether he\u2019s here or not. I mean, I look at you and I see him, you know?\u201d\nShe wiped at her face with one hand, dashing her eyes, and said, \u201cHe was proud of me,\u201d like a question.\n\u201cThe proudest,\u201d he said.\nEl nodded again and then made a tiny, strange little face that Steve caught from the corner of his eye. He\u2019d never seen her make that face before, and he\u2019d seen a lot of faces from El Hopper; she\u2019d become wildly expressive as soon as she\u2019d learned she was allowed. He stared at her for a moment, aware that something in him, a kind of primal alarm bell, was beginning to go off.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked slowly.\nShe made the face again, there and gone. \u201dFine.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. He flicked the spent cigarette to the floor, tamped it out with his heel, and moved so she was in front of him, face to face. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t fine. That was. What  was  that?\u201d\nThey stared each other down. He wondered briefly, hysterically, at how he\u2019d always wanted siblings when he was a kid \u2014 how he\u2019d always wanted a big family. Six kids, he thought, staring at one of them all grown up and building her own branch of the family, and a winnebago.\nEl admitted, \u201cContraction. My water broke an hour ago.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the  absolute fuck, Eleven,\u201d Steve said, wide eyed. He looked over her head to the open door out of the parlor and he could see his car parked in by some stranger\u2019s SUV, but the rental Eddie had been driving was off to the side, easy access. He didn\u2019t throw El over his shoulder but that was because she was a thousand years pregnant and in  active fucking labor. \n\u201cI did not want anyone to worry,\u201d El was saying. \u201cDo you think you could drive me to the hospital and then call everyone once we get there?\u201d\n\u201cCan I drive you \u2014 go get in Eddie\u2019s fucking car,\u201d he said, remarkably even all things considered, he thought.\nSteve\u00a0 walked her to the rental and settled her into the backseat before telling her he\u2019d be back in a minute and heading back into the house. She called after him, \u201cCould you get my overnight bag?\u201d\nEddie and Will were still in the kitchen, bent over an old DnD manual, the dweebs, and both of them straightened up instinctively at the no doubt wild-eyed look smeared across Steve\u2019s face. He felt calm all the same, that sort of peace that always came over him in times of crisis and alternate dimension demons.\nHis hands were steady, his voice placid, as he asked, \u201cWhere are Jonathan and Nancy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBabe?\u201d asked Eddie. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cThe baby,\u201d he said. \u201cEl\u2019s in labor. I\u2019m taking her to the hospital.\u201d\n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d said Will. His eyes had gone huge. He was already heading to the back staircase. \u201cI\u2019ll go get Mom. She just went upstairs for a second.\u201d\n\u201cJonathan and Nancy are in the living room, I think,\u201d said Eddie.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cEl\u2019s got a bag in her room she needs, can you go grab it and get Will and Joyce out to the car?\u201d\n\u201cOn it.\u201d He ducked in, kissed him on the corner of the mouth, and moved to follow in Will\u2019s footsteps up the stairs. \u201cMeet you outside.\u201d\nSteve shouldered his way through the guests until he found Jonathan and Nancy standing in a corner of the living room, huddled with Robin and Madchen. They all snapped to alert too, because if there was anything this family did well, it was read each other\u2019s emotions and immediately get ready to ride into battle. Madchen looked between them all, a little confused, he knew, but she\u2019d get used to it just as she\u2019d gotten used to some of Steve\u2019s other, less fun leftover habits from the Upside Down; the first time lights had flickered in the gym during a game of horse hadn\u2019t been fun for either of them.\n\u201cEl\u2019s having the baby,\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cI just put her in Eddie\u2019s rental; it was the only one that wasn\u2019t blocked in. We gotta go.\u201d\n\u201cHow far along are her contractions?\u201d asked Nancy.\n\u201cShe did not let me in on that,\u201d he said, \u201cjust announced that her water broke an hour ago, said she didn\u2019t want to worry anyone, and asked very politely if maybe I could drive her to the hospital.\u201d\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d said Robin.\n\u201cWhat a boss,\u201d said Madchen.\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s unreal,\u201d agreed Steve. \u201cWill\u2019s getting Joyce. Eddie\u2019s getting El\u2019s overnight bag. They\u2019ll meet me outside. What the fuck are we gonna do about all these people?\u201d\n\u201cOoh, idea! What if I go stand naked in the kitchen with a knife,\u201d said Robin, with the kind of manic energy that kept sealing the deal on their platonic soulmate relationship year after year. \u201cThat\u2019ll clear \u2018em out, right? Quick and easy. I\u2019m on it!\u201d\nShe marched off. Madchen immediately followed, tossing over her shoulder, \u201cGod, I\u2019m obsessed with her. I\u2019ll go make sure she doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nJonathan put his face in his hands, laughing quietly but somewhat hysterically. Nancy rolled her eyes and said, \u201cOkay, well, Steve, are you good to drive? Good. So then, Eddie, Joyce, and Will are with you and El; Robin, Madchen, Jonathan, and me\u2019ll ask everyone to leave, in a normal human fashion, and then when the boys and Max get back, we\u2019ll head to the hospital and meet you. Okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Steve. He clapped his hands together. \u201cBreak. Go team.\u201d\n\u201cBreak,\u201d she said, with another roll of her eyes.\nOutside, Will and Joyce had gotten into the back of the rental with El, Joyce pushing back El\u2019s hair from her face and Will holding her hand, while Eddie was dropping El\u2019s bag into the trunk. He moved to the side of the car and tossed Steve the keys over the roof as he climbed into the passenger seat.\nSteve slid into the driver\u2019s seat, didn\u2019t bother adjusting the mirrors, and said, \u201cEveryone buckled in? Good to go?\u201d\n\u201cI am having a baby,\u201d said El. Her eyes were wide. He wondered if the collective energy in the car \u2014 determined and, like Robin, a little increasingly manic \u2014 had made her realize that this was a thing that was actually happening. She was, he recalled abruptly, a few days past her due date anyway; it had gotten lost in the shuffle of the funeral and the wake and Steve bit down on his lip to stop from bursting into laughter. Only them, he thought.\n\u201cI am having a  baby,\u201d she said again.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, supergirl,\u201d said Eddie, twisting in his seat as Steve peeled out of the driveway. \u201cJust don\u2019t have it in the backseat, this shit\u2019s a rental.\u201d\nEl started giggling. \u201cI will keep my legs closed extra tight just for you.\u201d\n\u201cAtta girl,\u201d he said, winking.\nSomehow, Steve made it to the hospital without crashing, even if he did drive a solid ten over the speed limit the whole way. He threw the car into park outside the emergency room and they spilled out of the car like they were in a fifties\u2019 screwball comedy. An orderly smoking outside the hospital doors took one look at El \u2014 truly,  comically  pregnant looking surrounded by a coterie of flailing lunatics \u2014 and ducked inside only to return immediately with a wheelchair. Joyce got her settled in, Will was grabbing her bag from the trunk, and El was reaching her hand out to him.\n\u201cSteve,\u201d she said. Her eyes had gone from blank and grieving in the dairy parlor to wide-eyed shock and giddiness in the car to this now: pleading.\nEddie snatched the keys from Steve\u2019s fist and kissed him on the corner of his mouth again. \u201cI\u2019ll park the car. Me and Will will be \u2014 fuck, somewhere, who knows. We\u2019ll wait for the others, okay?\u201d\nTime blurred once more as they pushed El in the wheelchair into the hospital and were gestured by a nurse down a hallway, then another. Then Steve and Joyce were on either side of El's hospital bed, each holding one of her hands as the on-call OB-GYN was flipping through El\u2019s chart, asking, \u201cAnd when did your water break?\u201d\n\u201cTwo hours ago, now,\u201d said Steve, \u201cuh, give or take.\u201d\nThe doctor glanced up at him. \u201cAre you the father?\u201d\n\u201cBrother,\u201d said El, before Steve could get a word out. She squeezed his hand; he squeezed back.\n\u201cHer husband\u2019s on his way,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t at the house.\u201d\n\u201cHer contractions in the car were coming pretty close together,\u201d said Joyce, brow furrowed. \u201cShe\u2019d been having Braxton-Hicks contractions before too, and there'd been what we thought was a false alarm yesterday\u2026\u201d\nThe doctor nodded at this and put the chart back at the foot of the bed. She bent down and lifted El\u2019s gown for a physical exam and, after a moment, she stood back up wearing a sort of quizzical smile. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not your primary OB-GYN, Miss Hopper-Byers, and I know you said your water broke two hours ago, but I\u2019m willing to bet that wasn\u2019t a false alarm yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked El.\n\u201cYou\u2019re fully dialated, dear,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cSo either yesterday wasn\u2019t a false alarm or you are about to have one of the quickest first births I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s time to push.\u201d\nSteve, wide eyed, looked at Joyce, who frowned. \u201cCan she get an epidural?\u201d\nThe doctor shook her head. \u201cEven if you had gotten here an hour earlier, we would be in the same boat, I\u2019m afraid. As the athletes say, it\u2019s go time.\u201d\nEl\u2019s brows had drawn together. \u201cNo drugs?\u201d\n\u201cNo drugs,\u201d said the doctor.\nShe glanced between Joyce and Steve. She said, \u201cI can do it.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re gonna have to,\u201d said Steve. \u201cUnless you want me to hit you in the head with a brick or something.\u201d\n\u201cSteve.\u201d Joyce rolled her eyes while El giggled again. The adrenaline was kicking in, he assumed. Joyce was saying, \u201cOkay, honey, you heard the doctor then. It\u2019s time to push. You just squeeze our hands as hard as you need to, okay? Hard as you need to?\u201d\nThere had never been a single ounce of give up in Eleven Hopper. In this, as with everything, she nodded once, grit her teeth, and got down to business.\u00a0\nLike the doctor predicted, it went quickly. There was barely even time for Mike to arrive, running into the room with mere seconds to spare and then almost immediately having to sit down because he thought he was going to pass out, the shithead. Steve was never going to let him live it down, almost passing out during the birth of his first child.\nAnd so, with tears streaming down her face but her jaw set and the force of her grip probably fracturing a few small bones in his hand, El brought a small, tow-headed child, bloody and squalling, into the world.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a boy,\u201d Joyce said, watching the nurse move to clean the baby off. She brushed sweaty hair off El\u2019s brow and asked, \u201cDid you guys ever decide on a name?\u201d\nEl looked at Mike in his seat across the room. He was pale and shaky looking but beaming and El smiled too, soft, secretive.\n\u201cTerry,\u201d she said. \u201cTerry James Wheeler.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cA lot of people think of  Girl with a Buzzcut (Reprise)  as a gay anthem,\u201d I say.\nLevy grins. \u201cReally? I love that. I mean, it\u2019s about someone who has spent so long searching for love and belonging and finally finding it in the arms of a family they made for themselves, of someone no longer thinking of themselves as a monster \u2014 so I can totally see that journey. Oh, wow, I\u2019m getting a little misty eyed about that!\u201d\n\u201cYou never thought of it that way?\u201d\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s a straight up monster-killing badass deserving of love,\u201d he says seriously. \u201cNo gay allegories here. Just monster hunting and murder. But I like that people apparently see it that way. That\u2019s really \u2014 I just like it. It\u2019s funny,\u201d he adds. \u201cI've been out to my friends for a long time. And I didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think I, like, set out to hide it in my music. To hide my own sexuality, I mean. I was, like, never exactly subtle about it to begin with. My friends would probably say there\u2019s not a subtle bone in my body, you know? But it wasn\u2019t explicit. It\u2019s just there. It\u2019s who I am. I\u2019m just \u2014 private, I guess. It\u2019s fucked up, though, right? You don\u2019t think about, like, a song like, I don\u2019t know,  Sweet Child O\u2019 Mine, and are like, Oh shit, those pronouns, that is a heterosexual love song. Wait, maybe that\u2019s a bad example. How about  I Wanna Be Your Lover. No gendered pronouns in there, but it is a love song, and you don\u2019t think straight or gay with it, right, off the top of your head? It\u2019s just a love song. I wrote, uh, lets see,  We\u2019ll Never Have Sex  and  ONE MORE EROTIC NIGHTMARE ABOUT YOU  and people were like, That\u2019s a love song. Those are love songs. No one was like \u2014 that\u2019s a  gay  love song, even though I do think  EROTIC NIGHTMARE  is very gay, when you get down to it, heh, but they were just love songs \u2014 songs about longing, need, want and not having, quiet desperation. It was opaque. But then I had to go and put  Live to See You In That Dress (Live to See Undress)  and  I Wore His Jacket  back to back and people lost their minds.\u201d\n\u2014  Excerpted from \u201cGrunge and Gay: Musician Ed Levy of The Shotguns On Being Out and Proud,\u201d The Advocate, July 1995 \n\n\n\nEl stayed in the hospital for a few days, the whole of the Party coming and going. They took turns keeping El company and watching the baby through the maternity ward windows. Mike wandered the halls with a dazed expression half the time, and Dustin, Lucas, and Will ribbed him constantly for it. Max practically demanded a cot right next to El\u2019s, determined to keep her company as long as she was there.\nEventually, though, she returned to the farm, little Terry in her arms, staring at him in wonder and delight, Mike hovering behind her, and real life began to creep in for the rest of them. It had been nearly six weeks since Jonathan had called; it was time to return to where they\u2019d all been before. Nancy, Jonathan, and the kids headed back first; Nancy had gotten away with a longer leave than a reporter normally got, only because she was the Editor-in-Chief and because she managed to answer emails within an hour of receiving them, two time zones away. Still, a day after El was released, that branch of the Byers\u2019s family tree was getting back on a plane after making plans for Thanksgiving.\nRobin and Madchen headed back to Chicago the day after that. Robin had pushed back the start date for her new job long enough and needed to get started before she lost it, and Madchen had lesson plans to start. Steve had hugged each of them goodbye out on the lawn and Robin had said, \u201cDinner when you get back, okay? We never got to  debrief  on you  debriefing  Eddie.\u201d\n\u201cJesus, I thought I dodged that bullet,\u201d he said with a groan.\nMadchen snorted. Robin winked. \u201cNever, babe. Imma need a full PowerPoint presentation. You two finally getting your shit together is, like, my World Series.\u201d\nDustin, Lucas, and Max all catch a flight back to LA after a week. Dustin was due on a movie set at the end of the month, Lucas needed to ink the Nike deal in person, and Max, as always, had patients to see. They made plans to go to Mike and El\u2019s place in New York at the end of August, before Lucas\u2019s training camp started up, and set up individual trips to Chicago to see Steve. Lucas and Max would plan around Lucas\u2019s game schedule, and Dustin would come in December, for  The Two Towers.\nWill, Eddie, and Steve, however, all stuck around. Will could, and did, write from anywhere; his boyfriend had flown in for the funeral and then flown right back out because he was in the middle of some show, but Will was planning on staying until Mike and El were ready to drive back to New York. He was planning on trading off driving with Mike, and to be a third set of hands so the new parents could actually rest some nights as they drove.\nSteve didn\u2019t really have anywhere to go until mid-August, when he was expected to be back at school, and Eddie \u2014 well, Eddie just shrugged when he asked him when he needed to get back to writing at his studio. Steve, who had woken up to an empty bed a few times over the past month and seen lights on out in the dairy parlor at two am or heard soft guitar sounds from the guest bath, suspected the writer\u2019s block had ended some time ago and that Eddie hadn\u2019t wanted to jinx it.\nSo they stayed on the farm, helping with the baby here and there and helping to pack up the last of Hopper\u2019s things so Joyce didn\u2019t have to. Hopper had demanded the family take what they wanted and then donate the rest, not wanting his ghost to linger in the house more than it already would. Steve picked a few shirts, some books; Eddie took records.\nSteve spent a lot of time, too, with Joyce late at night at the kitchen table, drinking tea or, on one memorable occasion, doing whiskey shots from one of Hopper\u2019s half-finished bottles. Steve told her stories about Hopper breaking up his teenage parties, the time Hopper had found him with a traffic cone stuck in his head when he was fifteen and drunk and Hopper had laughed so hard he had to sit down, and Joyce had told him stories of when they were in high school and Hopper got up to a lot of Steve\u2019s old antics. They\u2019d woken Will up with their laughter and he\u2019d rolled his eyes but joined them anyway, going shot for shot with them until Joyce drank them both quite literally under the table. Eddie, emerging from his mystery  so late it was early morning  business in the dairy parlor, had had to escort all three of them to bed. Will had ended up curled up with his mom, too drunk to make it another flight of stairs, and Eddie had had to bodily carry Steve the rest of the way.\nHe\u2019d paused, however, to let Steve sloppily make out with him in the stairwell landing just below the attic for a long while, his body pressing Eddie\u2019s into the wall, aimless, not really wanting anything from it but closeness. Steve felt safe, harbored against Eddie\u2019s body, like a ship in a storm, and if he was being honest with himself, no one had ever before made him feel that way. Eventually, he\u2019d pulled back, ran his hands through Steve\u2019s hair, left his thumbs pressing into his cheekbones and said, so fondly, \u201cC'mon, baby, let\u2019s get you to bed \u2014 you\u2019re already gonna have a hell of a hangover.\u201d And then he\u2019d laid on his side so Steve could spoon in behind him, face pressed in the space between his shoulder blades, and hummed Steve to sleep.\nEl, Mike, and the baby had slept through it, and had teased them for their hangovers in the morning. El, in fact, had taken one look at Steve and plopped Terry in his lap and announced she was going for a walk.\nSteve didn\u2019t mind. He\u2019d always liked kids, and Terry wasn\u2019t the first fresh newborn he\u2019d spent time around these days. He\u2019d spent a whole month in Nancy and Jonathan\u2019s guest room when Barbie was born, him and Robin, pitching in with night feedings and diaper changes. Terry, too, was a remarkably chill baby: quiet and calm, he watched everything with his huge, dark eyes\u00a0 \u2014 his mom\u2019s eyes \u2014 and only occasionally pulled at Steve\u2019s hair.\nOne night, three weeks after they said goodbye to Hopper and welcomed Terry in the space of a few hours, Mike and Will were crowded around the stove, arguing about the correct firmness for the spaghetti they were making. Joyce was sitting at the table, watching them and smiling, a little sadly but still smiling, and El had retreated to the bedroom after putting Terry down for a nap. She\u2019d gotten good at sleeping when the baby slept.\nEddie was nowhere to be seen; Steve had been looking for him, wanting to see if he\u2019d like to come along on a grocery run since Mike and Will\u2019s argument was shaping up to mean they were running out of pasta sooner rather than later. But he hadn\u2019t been in the dairy parlor, the attic, or the guest bath. He was passing through the kitchen to make his way to Hopper\u2019s office when he caught sight of the baby monitor at Joyce\u2019s elbow. Faint music was playing.\n\u201cDid El leave a record on for Terry?\u201d he asked.\nJoyce shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s your man.\u201d\n\u201cI swear,\u201d said Mike, interrupting himself mid rant about al dente to Will, who was rolling his eyes, \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to get him to record a kid\u2019s album because Ter\u2019s not gonna fall asleep to jack  shit  once he leaves.\u201d\nSteve jerked his thumb in the general direction of the nursery. \u201cWant me to lodge a formal complaint?\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d said Mike. \u201cAnd remember we can hear everything on that monitor, so, like, leave room for Jesus.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the nursery, dipshit, I think I can keep it in my pants for ten minutes,\u201d he said, turning and rolling his eyes now too. Mike had neither heard nor walked in on anything at all \u2014 unlike certain other members of their family, Dustin and Lucas claimed to be scarred for life \u2014 but he was still bent out of shape about Steve\u2019s bathroom comments.\nHe went back up the back stairwell and quietly stepped towards the room Barbie and Scott usually stayed in. After they\u2019d left, it had been quickly turned into a makeshift nursery for as long as El and Mike were there and, when Steve pushed the door the rest of the way open, there was Eddie, cross legged on the floor in front of the crib, strumming quietly on the beat to hell old Warlock he\u2019d saved all their lives with all those years ago. He didn\u2019t pull it out for shows anymore, but carried it with him on trips like this; he said it was still his favorite thing to compose on.\nSteve watched from the doorway for a moment, listening to the soft, delicate hush of his voice, craning his head to see his fingers move along the fret, and it was a moment before he could make out the lyrics of the lullaby.\nOnly, he realized, it wasn\u2019t, it was \u2014\n\u201cLook at the  way  we gotta hide what we\u2019re doin\u2019,\u201d he crooned, spare and pared down, voice smokey despite the high notes he was hitting quietly and gently, effortlessly, \u201ccause what would they  say  if they ever knew, and so we\u2019re runnin\u2019 just as fast as we can, holdin\u2019 on to one another\u2019s hands \u2014 \u201d\n\u2014 it was fucking  Tiffany.\nHe bit at his own mouth, trying not to smile. Fuck, he thought, blinking back tears, he loved that stone-cold weirdo so much. How had he waited for so long to tell him? He pressed one hand to his cheek, watching him sing to the baby in the crib, his heart beating in his chest, and thought of Joyce and Hopper, his arm across her shoulders, planning one final date they\u2019d never go on.\nIt didn\u2019t matter that he\u2019d waited. He didn\u2019t care, not like he used to: he would do it all again, everything the same, because it meant he got to have him now, and for however long they\u2019d have after.\nA tear rolled down Steve\u2019s cheek and he dashed it away, smiling still; and Eddie sang on, \u201cI think we\u2019re alone now, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone a-ro-ound. I think we\u2019re alone now, the beating of our hearts is the only s-ah-ound \u2014 hmmmm, hmm, hmmmm \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cSo is there like a membership you lose if the metalheads find out you know all the words to  I Think We\u2019re Alone Now, or,\u201d said Steve.\nEddie\u2019s fingers tripped over the chords, a discordant sound, and he immediately wrapped his hand around the frets to silence the noise. They both stared at the crib, checking, and then he whipped his head around, hissing, \u201cWhat the  fuck, Stevie.\u201d\nIt just made Steve\u2019s smile widen. \u201cLanguage, Ed.\u201d\n\u201cOh, please,\u201d he scoffed, \u201clike Wheeler\u2019s kid\u2019s first words weren\u2019t already gonna be something horrific. It\u2019s been  fuck this, fuck that  since he was, like, ten. You said it yourself!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s, like, cheating if you help him learn  fuck. Anyway, I got my money in the pot for  eggos.\u201d\nEddie snorted. He held out a hand, said, \u201cWhat\u2019s with you and lurking in doorways like we\u2019re in an Ang Lee movie? Come here, now you\u2019ve scared the absolute bullroar out of me.\u201d\n\u201cBullroar?\u201d he asked as he stepped quietly into the room and took a seat in front of the crib next to Eddie.\n\u201cYeah, bullroar,\u201d he said. He strummed absently on the strings of the Warlock.\nSteve nudged him with his knee. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d\n\u201cAbout Tiffany?\u201d He snorted. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to like stuff that isn\u2019t grunge or metal, and, anyway, none of my own sh-stuff is age appropriate. In fact, most of them are thinly veiled illusions to wanting to get into your pants.\u201d\n\u201cSweet,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou know it,\u201d said Eddie. \u201cMaybe I could turn Girl with a Buzzcut  into a lullaby, the reprise \u2014 think El could dig it?\u201d\n\u201cOh, definitely,\u201d he told him and Eddie shot him a soft smile, the kind that felt like it lit all of Steve\u2019s nerve endings on fire; he didn\u2019t think they\u2019d ever stop doing that to him. Eddie strummed again on the guitar, this time with a little more purpose, and he recognized the opening strains of Eddie\u2019s first big hit.\nSteve shifted a little, leaning gently into his side, watching him work.\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d Eddie said after a moment, brow still furrowed in concentration.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cBeing here,\u201d he said, \u201cand not having Hopper just \u2014 show up in the doorway to yell at me about something.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Steve. He looked at the crib and then back to Eddie\u2019s hands, his face. He said, \u201cI keep thinking of something I want to say to him, and then I go looking for him and \u2014 he\u2019s not there. But every room feels like he was just there, you know?\u201d\n\u201cI remember when Uncle Wayne went,\u201d said Eddie. He glanced at Steve, who nodded. He remembered too, obviously; Eddie had been right, that night. After Wayne had passed in his sleep from a massive heart attack back in \u201895, Steve and Joyce had arranged everything for his service before Eddie had even begun wrapping his mind around it. Steve had called a synagogue in Chicago for help, and the rabbi there had walked him through everything he needed to know before he\u2019d picked up Joyce and driven to Pittsburgh with her to plan the service.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel real for, like, a long time, to me,\u201d he was saying. \u201cI didn\u2019t see him much, at the end, because I was always touring or recording or something. But we talked on the phone all the time, you know? And even now, I, like, forget. I call his old landline and there\u2019s a minute there where I\u2019m shocked when someone new picks up and I don\u2019t recognize the voice, you know? Shit, I literally did it just the other day.\u201d\n\u201cYou did?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He turned to look at Steve. \u201cI wanted to tell him about you. About us. Completely slipped my mind that I couldn\u2019t. And fuck if that didn\u2019t bum me out. There\u2019s so many things I wanna talk to him about still, get his advice on, and I can\u2019t. But at the same time \u2014 I know he\u2019s happy for me, wherever it is we go after. Because he was so proud of me, when he went. How we got out, how  I  got out, and became\u00a0 \u2014  this, and I think: he knows, he\u2019s there, he\u2019s right there.\u201d He strummed the guitar, hit a few notes. \u201cSometimes, when I sing, I\u2019m singing to him and him alone, you know? I think that\u2019s why I like recording alone. It\u2019s like I\u2019m having a conversation with someone who I can\u2019t have a conversation with anymore. Him. Chrissy. You, for a while. Hopper, now. I tell myself: they\u2019re there, they\u2019re listening, and eventually it doesn\u2019t hurt so bad anymore.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI told you,\u201d said Eddie. He shifted, gently put his guitar down and turned to face Steve fully. \u201cI wrote all of them for you, baby, whether you were listening or not.\u201d\n\u201cI was listening,\u201d he told him. \u201cI listened to all of them, I just \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m here now,\u201d said Steve. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not going anywhere. You know that, right?\u201d\nEddie took his hand.\n\u201cYeah. I know,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither am I.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is my favorite bar in Chicago,\u201d Ed Levy tells me, slouching down into the seat of the booth. Out of context, he\u2019s unassuming. He looks like: some guy you know. He\u2019s got on a beat up Royals ball cap \u2014 his partner\u2019s, he says, he doesn\u2019t follow sports \u2014 over his shaggy hair, ponytail pulled through the back, and wears an ancient looking pair of Reeboks, and torn black jeans. His t-shirt has a print of one of William Byers\u2019s book covers on it, the arm holes cut practically to his waist, flannel over that. He\u2019s drinking a Peroni and he asks me three times if I want a soft pretzel, because they\u2019re made fresh in the kitchen and they\u2019re \u201cjust so good, man!\u201d\nI marvel: this is one of the most influential musicians of my generation, a metalhead turned pioneer of the grunge scene, and he lights up like a little kid when he clocks a copy of  Fellowship  spilling out of my bag.\nLevy is fun, almost bubbly; overdramatic and charismatic at equal turns; he greeted the bartender by name when he came in, shared a fistbump with him, and now spends the first fifteen minutes of our time together grilling me on the book after learning it\u2019s my first time reading it.\nEventually, I steer him towards the point of our meeting at this Chicago bar. A week from our shared beers, his long awaited sixth studio album is dropping:  Boy with a Bat. Earlier this month, I got swept into a Seattle studio to listen to the master copy; it felt like I was listening to state secrets, a record company intern checking my bag on the way in and the way out for recording devices. I almost expected to be patted down for a wire.\nBut it was understandable.  Boy with a Bat  shares a lot of thematic similarities with the album that made Levy\u2019s career, and not just because the names are reminiscent.  Girl with a Buzzcut  and  Boy with a Bat  both deal predominately with grief and anger; but while  Girl  feels more like grief of a teenage heartbreak at times, and anger at an unjust system,  Boy  is the grief of the passage of time, of anger at the things we never got the chance to say or do. And  Boy  understands where  Girl rages. It\u2019s filled with sweeping soundscapes, startlingly beautiful story-telling and thoughtfully crafted lyrics, intricate melodies, and a raw, emotional intensity that feels impossibly vulnerable: like you\u2019re looking into the beating heart of Levy himself.\n\u201cMy partner\u2019s father was dying,\u201d says Levy. \u201dHe\u2019d been dying for a long time. Cancer. And so we all went home to be with him, while it happened, and I\u2019d been struggling so hard to write for so long and then it just \u2014 I don\u2019t know, something unlocked. I wrote all of the album while we were there \u2014 I actually got to play most of it for Jim, too, which \u2014 which was huge for me, to be able to share this with him before he went. You know, even before my partner and I got together, his dad was, like, one of the only positive male role models I ever had and, man, was it against his will.\u201d He laughs. \u201cAnyway. I was writing this album, and he died \u2014 and then my partner\u2019s sister went into labor at the funeral and \u2014 yeah, no shit, right? I mean, full-on rom-com shit, that June. It\u2019s a super personal album to me, maybe my most personal now, even more so than\u00a0Quarry. I actually recorded something like three-fourths of it in the guest bath of the house.\u201d\nHe sips his Peroni, bites the edge of his thumb. He continues, \u201cYou can actually hear, like, all of them, the whole family, on the album because of that. Because none of them knew what I was doing \u2014 just Jim, my partner\u2019s dad. I think Steve knew too, but he never said.\u201d\n\u201cSteve is your partner?\u201d I ask, and if I thought Levy\u2019s face lit up at  Fellowship, it\u2019s nothing compared to me mentioning his partner\u2019s name.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s actually \u2014 I mean, dig this, but he is in fact the boy.\u201d\n\u201cThe boy with the bat? Wait, he\u2019s the boy? Is he the cover art?\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Levy laughs again. \u201cOh man, he\u2019s gonna be so embarrassed that people know! He\u2019s, like, so shy compared to me. But. Yeah. He is the boy with the bat. Been my muse since I was twenty years old, and I saw him swing that shit. My favorite thing about the album? You got to listen to it, right? I never dropped  Memphis, Indiana as a single, but, towards the end, you can hear, there\u2019s \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cLaughter,\u201d I say, eyes wide.\nLevy beams. \u201cThat\u2019s Steve.\u201d\n\u2014  Excerpted from \u201cEd Levy on Grief, Growth, and that Boy with the Baseball Bat,\u201d Stereogum, July 2003 \nGirl with a Buzzcut (1990) [Album Cover: A girl with a buzzcut sitting on a sofa with \u2018The Shotguns\u2019 painted on the wall behind it]\n1.
