    "text": "\nAge 18\n\n\u00a0\nThey almost don\u2019t survive the July Attacks.\nThe day passes in a haze of smoke, and heat, and gut clenching fear. When later asked to recall the events of the day, Bakugou will only be able to talk about individual moments, like the sound of the bombs detonating before the morning bell had rung; like running at villains with Deku by his side; like standing between Moonfish and a huddle of civilians and crouching down low like a threatened animal, smoke swirling around his fists.\nBakugou doesn\u2019t remember sustaining the injury that eventually takes him out of the fight. He had been collecting injuries all day. He\u2019s still not sure how he survived the day with all his teeth in place.\nHowever, for years to come, he will clearly remember sitting in the ER.\nThe plastic chair is too small to contain all of him, some 6ft of teenage hero, cracked wrist-grenades abandoned by his boots. No one is there to treat him, too busy with the hundreds of injured civilians. He blinks blood out of his eyes, his ears ringing.\nThe muted TV in the corner of the waiting room plays a live feed of what\u2019s happening throughout the city. Bakugou watches through drooping lids as they pan over half-destroyed buildings, showing his exhausted classmates hauling people out of the rubble.\nTime passes. Bakugou forces himself to keep his eyes open. The TV is a continuous stream of destruction. They show cars cleaved in half, and tight-lipped reporters in front of a background of smoke, and then the shot changes\u2014\nAnd there\u2019s Deku. He\u2019s streaked with blood and soot, sweaty bangs plastered to his face, and he\u2019s thrusting a fist into the air in triumph. He\u2019s smiling.\nIt\u2019s this moment that will stick out in his mind: the moment Deku defeats Shigaraki. The moment the country exhales in relief. The moment Deku takes his first real step as All Might\u2019s successor in the eyes of the world. The moment Bakugou realises that things are changing.\nBakugou is given a hospital room, eventually. A trainee nurse spots him slumped in his seat, his eyes still focussed on the TV, and rushes over. She blushes, and bows, and apologises for not waiting on him hand on foot. Bakugou grunts. He doesn\u2019t have the energy to tell her that he\u2019s fine, and that if they were going to prioritise treating him over saving civilians\u2019 lives then they would be making his entire job redundant. What would be the point in working his ass off as a hero if he let the people he\u2019d just protected die because he wanted special treatment?\nA more experienced nurse intercepts them. She doesn\u2019t gush over Bakugou like the trainee does, but she does purse her lips and find him a private room. When he wakes up in two days time, groggy and exhausted, he\u2019ll have a decision to make: what kind of hero does he want to be?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAge 21\n\n\u00a0\nBakugou is on his way back from picking up ingredients for dinner. There\u2019s a park near their apartment building, usually populated by kids. Kirishima often says he likes the atmosphere it gives off. It makes their area feel suburban, even though they live less than fifteen minutes from the city centre.\nToday, though, there aren\u2019t little kids running around the playground. Instead, there\u2019s a group of kids surrounding a boy curled up on the ground, protecting his head. The kids are using their quirks. The boy is not.\nThe sun catches in the boy\u2019s curls, turning it seaweed green, highlighting the bloody scrape along one cheek, and for a moment, all Bakugou can see is Deku, laid out on the grass, quirkless and trembling, his skin still smoking from the force of Bakugou\u2019s explosions.\nBakugou drops his groceries. Vegetables spill over the sidewalk. He\u2019s yelling before he registers exactly what\u2019s happening, his legs moving on their own.\n\u201cHey, get the fuck away from him!\u201d\nThe kids look up, see Bakugou charging at them, and bolt in the opposite direction. Bakugou wants to chase after them and teach the little scumbags a lesson, but the boy is closer. He sees Bakugou and screams, scrambling back on all fours.\nBakugou stops, extinguishing the explosions popping against his palms.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Bakugou says in the tone he reserves for spooked civilians, \u201cit\u2019s okay. They\u2019re gone.\u201d\nThe boy peeks up at Bakugou from beneath his lashes. \u201cI don\u2019t have any money.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your shitty lunch money.\u201d The kid looks even more worried now, like the only two things someone might want of him is money or pain. Bakugou scrubs a hand through his hair, suddenly feeling out of his depth. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you. I wanted to beat up those other brats, sure, but not you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cThey were hurting you. It pissed me off.\u201d\nThe kid looks down at the patchy grass. He\u2019s no longer braced to bolt if Bakugou gets too close, but he still won\u2019t look him in the eye.\n\u201cThey were just playing a bit rough,\u201d the kid mumbles. \u201cQuirks are like that.\u201d\n\u201cYou and I both know that\u2019s not true. Hey, look at me.\u201d The kid does, eyebrows pinching together as he looks Bakugou over. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nThe kid nods, and says, before Bakugou has a chance to call him on his bullshit, \u201cAre you the Explosion Hero, Detonation? Is that why you jumped in to save me?\u201d\n\u201cI intervened because those kids were picking on someone that wasn\u2019t fighting back. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re a hero. That must be it. No adult has ever \u2026 \u201d\nThe kid says it so innocently, with a tilt of his head and a wry smile, but it sends a jolt of ice through Bakugou\u2019s stomach. Because this kid is laying in the dirt, blood smeared up one side of his face, smiling and vacant-eyed, and it\u2019s so familiar. Tremors work their way up the kid\u2019s arms, and his skin is bruised and scorched, and he\u2019s struggling to pick himself up because he knows that no one else is coming to help him\u2014and he looks like Deku.\nWhen Bakugou thinks back to his childhood, to the summers spent at the local park, Deku sprawled out beneath him and a pack of cheering, faceless boys behind him, he can\u2019t remember anyone ever intervening.\n\u201cYou need to get those injuries treated,\u201d Bakugou says.\nHe escorts the kid home. He learns that his name is Isao. He learns that a doctor diagnosed him as quirkless three years ago. He learns that this isn\u2019t the first time Isao has come home looking like this.\nIsao\u2019s mother ushers them both inside. She doesn\u2019t look surprised to see the marks on her son, but she does look surprised to see Bakugou there, and to hear that he intervened on her son\u2019s behalf.\nShe cleans Isao up before focussing on Bakugou. She looks stressed. She looks like she\u2019s used to being stressed.\nDid Inko look like this when he beat up her son? She always had been a crier. Deku got that from her. Did Deku\u2019s injuries make her cry? He had always been stupidly selfless; he probably hid it from her whenever he could.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she says, reaching for his hand. Bakugou lets her hold it. Her hands are small and dry against his.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Bakugou says.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she says again. Her voice shakes with the force of her words.\nBakugou wishes she wouldn\u2019t do that. He likes the glory of heroism, but having civilians come over to personally thank him always feels awkward. And unnecessary.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Bakugou says stiffly.\nHe takes the next morning off and goes with her to report the bullying to the local elementary school. The principal falls over herself when she recognises Bakugou, and even as she promises to reprimand the kids at fault, to do everything in her power to make sure it never happens again, Bakugou still leaves with a hollow pit in his stomach. It doesn\u2019t feel like enough. He hates feeling useless.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAge 18\n\n\u00a0\nTime behaves strangely during fights. Sometimes, his instincts take over until he\u2019s nothing but a moving body and the flash-bang of his explosions. The July Attacks require everything from him. His body is all muscle movement. Time surges around him in fits\u00a0and starts.\nBakugou has been running on adrenaline for hours. The city is screaming around him. Clouds of smoke roll over the horizon like a wave, blanketing the city in ash. Everything registers in his periphery, unimportant compared to the here and the now, the villains immediately in front of him, the frenzied civilians behind him, and Deku, somewhere to the right and above, tearing through the air, bouncing off of skyscrapers like a rogue ping-pong ball.\nAnd then everything slows, and Bakugou takes in the entire street.\nThere\u2019s a family to his left. Moonfish knifed through the daughter\u2019s leg, leaving her crumpled on the pavement, her face bone-white with shock. Her parents are pawing at her nearly severed leg. They\u2019re in shock, too.\nMoonfish has his eyes set on them. His head jerks to the side to see the son frozen a few metres away, eyes focussed on the upturned meat of his sister\u2019s leg.\nDeku is air-borne, chasing after a winged Nomu that\u2019s latched onto a limp hero.\nAnd then Bakugou sees Shigaraki running in the opposite direction, just out of range of his explosions.\nThe girl with the bloody leg isn\u2019t crying, but her parents are. The father takes in great gulps of air, and the mother wails, her hands sliding uselessly through the pooling blood.\nMoonfish is there. Watching them.\nDeku is there, too, but he\u2019s not close enough to save the family. He\u2019s over a 100ft in the air, too far away to even register that the family is there.\nHe has a choice, he realises. This moment\u2014it\u2019s a choice.\nShigaraki scuttles down the street, his back to Bakugou, clutching at a cellphone. If Bakugou can get to him, if he can personally bring down the man in the centre of this whole attack, drag his plans out of him through sheer force of will, then he\u2019ll have won. He can see it now\u2014the other heroes\u2019 faces as they realise a student bested them; his classmates watching him from a distance; Shigaraki\u2019s face bloodied from his explosions, struggling as he\u2019s cuffed and lead away. Shigaraki is the biggest catch. Taking him down would be the biggest achievement.\nExcept\u2014it wouldn\u2019t be a victory.\nBakugou wrenches his eyes away from Shigaraki, and runs, boots pounding against the asphalt. He doesn\u2019t stop until he\u2019s in front of the family, braced like a wall between them and Moonfish, head ducked low, a feral snarl on his lips.\nTry and touch them, his eyes say. Try and hurt them again while I\u2019m here\u2014I dare you.\nDeku is strong enough to handle Shigaraki. Bakugou trusts him to find the bastard later on and take him down.\nIt doesn\u2019t feel like a life-changing decision at the time\u2014it was instinct more than conscious thought that had moved him\u2014but Bakugou will look back on that moment, and feel \u2026 something. It\u2019s something like pride. It\u2019s something like shame for that split second he saw Shigaraki and Moonfish and the trembling family, and considered abandoning them in order to peruse the bigger prey. It\u2019s something like a realisation.\nIt was like his body had already made the decision to put himself between a psychopath and those weaker than him, leaving the bigger victories to Deku. It had felt good, it had felt right, to plant himself in front of someone weaker and refuse to be moved.\nThis feeling, this compulsion\u2014is this what has been fuelling Deku for years? Is this what Deku was feeling when they were four years old, and he had stood, trembling and snot-nosed, between some weak kid and Bakugou?\nThe thought will stay with him for days. It\u2019ll linger in the back of his mind when Bakugou wakes up in his hospital room two days later. Drugged and vaguely nauseated, he lays on his back, staring up at the tessellating ceiling, and thinking about the family\u2019s reaction after he\u2019d taken out Moonfish. The mother reached out for him with bloodied hands. The son fell into his arms, clutching at his costume. The father looked like he\u2019d be sick with the force of his relief.\nIt was uncomfortable. They were sweaty and panicked, and they smeared blood all down his arms, and the short moment between Moonfish\u2019s defeat and the family\u2019s delivery to the closest paramedic, all he could think about was that split moment that he stared at Shigaraki\u2019s retreating back and imagined chasing after him.\nThe thought had made him sick. It still does, days later.\nBut\u2014Bakugou hadn\u2019t done that. He had choked on that one moment of indecision, and then turned and fought against Moonfish like a man possessed. He\u2019d been ready to leave everything to take Shigaraki down, and then, moments later, he\u2019d been prepared to die in front of the family of strangers. Two very different types of heroes. Which one is the real one?\nWhat type of hero does he want to be?\nHe remembers the family hugging each other after Moonfish was knocked out, alive because of him. A hero that never loses. A hero that\u2019s always there. That\u2019s the kind of hero he wants to be. Even if it\u2019s not the kind of hero he\u2019s been for the past eighteen years of his life.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAge 21\n\n\u00a0\nAs a pro hero, Bakugou is expected to do all kinds of crap that doesn\u2019t directly involve punching villains the face. There\u2019s more PR bullshit involved with being a hero than he had expected. Most of the time, it bugs the shit out of him, but maybe he can use it to his advantage.\nThe next time the usual lady from management comes to his office to talk to him, Bakugou doesn\u2019t scowl at her like he usually does. This time, he interrupts Miss Management before she can organise another unimportant meet and greet.\n\u201cWhat about talks?\u201d Bakugou says.\nMiss Management looks up from her tablet. \u201cTalks? Like Q and As?\u201d\nBakugou shakes his head. \u201cTalks at schools. Or even PSAs. Advocating.\u201d\nOther heroes are often roped into doing PSAs about looking both ways before crossing the street, or eating your veggies, or staying behind police barriers when villain fights break out. Those jobs always go to straight-laced heroes like Ingenium or Creati, or the eternally smiling, dependable heroes like Uravity, Red Riot, or Deku. Not to heroes like Bakugou.\n\u201cAdvocacy,\u201d Miss Management repeats. He glares at her for sounding so disbelieving, but she\u2019s too busy pulling out her phone and writing up emails to notice. \u201cThat\u2019s perfect. Finally, we can show off your dependable side\u2014don\u2019t look at me like that, I know you have a dependable side buried beneath all that animosity. The kids\u2019 network are running a series of PSAs about safe quirk usage. I can get you booked in for Tuesday\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo. Bullying.\u201d She looks up from her tablet. Bakugou looks her in the eye, arms crossed over his chest. \u201cI want to talk to kids about bullying.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAge 18\n\n\u00a0\nThe next time Bakugou wakes up, it takes him a moment to recognise the hospital room he\u2019s in. The first thing he does after getting his bearings is guzzle down the water left by his bedside. The next thing he does is vomit onto the floor.\nA nurse sighs in the doorway, like she\u2019s deeply disappointed in his entire existence. Bakugou tries to flip her off, but his hands are bandaged too thickly to use his fingers. It was a wonder he was able to hold the water bottle.\nThe third thing he does, after being cleaned up and checked over by a doctor, is demand to know what happened. The nurse sits by his bed, and indulges him. It\u2019s not the trainee nurse from early\u2014it\u2019s the older one. Her lips are pursed through the entire explanation, and Bakugou\u2019s glad, almost. It makes it easier to hear the list of causalities. No one he\u2019s close to has died, and none of his classmates were even permanently injured, but the destruction and death is still vast. The villains\u2019 have won, in a way. Bakugou hates imperfect victories.\nKirishima is okay. The nurse tells him that he came by the hospital to see him. They almost didn\u2019t let him in because he\u2019s not family, but Bakugou\u2019s parents saw Kirishima, bruised and bandaged from his own fight but not bedridden, pleading with the woman at the service desk, and frog-marched him through security to see Bakugou.\nBakugou had been unconscious, but it must have been reassuring to see he was alive and not permanently injured. Bakugou would be jealous\u2014he wants to see for his own eyes that Kirishima is alright\u2014but if Kirishima is visiting him rather than the other way around, then that means Kirishima is less injured than he is. Thank god.\nStill, Kirishima isn\u2019t well enough to keep up a bedside vigil, so he was sent home to rest. Bakugou is sure\u2014and so is the nurse, judging by the way she rubs at her temples\u2014that Kirishima will be back as soon as he can.\nWhen the nurse leaves, a restless itch settles beneath Bakugou\u2019s skin. After the heat of battle, the quietness leaves him feeling like he\u2019s forgetting something. Like he\u2019s left something unfinished.\nAnd then his mind circles back to the fights. To Shigaraki, and Moonfish, and the family blubbering all over him with relief.\nTo Deku.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAge 21\n\n\u00a0\nThe first talk doesn\u2019t go well according to Miss Management. He had, apparently, \u201ccome on too strong.\u201d The school should\u2019ve expected foul language when they arranged for him to come. This is one of the reasons Bakugou has so much respect for UA; they never coddled their kids.\nThe second and third talks go a little better, in that none of the teachers glare at him as he steps away from the lectern, but he still feels like he\u2019s talking to a brick wall. He stares out at the auditorium full of blank faces, and wants to shake each of them. He wants to launch into the crowd, and grab the boys leant back in the seats, smirking and laughing, and shake them until they understand.\nBut he can\u2019t do that. He bows, thanks the teachers for their time, scribbles out autographs, and leaves, feeling hollow.\nThe afternoon after his third talk at a local high school, Bakugou changes into civilian clothes and takes the train to Deku\u2019s apartment.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDeku is on nightshift for once, so he\u2019s home when Bakugou arrives mid-afternoon without warning. To his credit, he only looks mildly surprised when he sees Bakugou. He invites Bakugou in, and goes into the kitchen to fetch coffee while Bakugou sits on the couch. Barkugou, their dumb dog, paws at his feet, tail wagging incessantly, like it recognises him as its namesake. They\u2019ve only had the puppy for a few weeks, and Bakugou is still annoyed that Todoroki and Deku named the thing after him.\nIt\u2019s not the dog\u2019s fault, though. Bakugou finally gives in and pulls the dog onto his lap.\nDeku returns with two mugs, handing him one. He sits down on the opposite end of the couch from Bakugou, and they talk about work, and Barkugou, and their ex-classmates. It\u2019s awkward, at first. It always is until they shove away that initial fake-politeness and get down to the bones of what they need to say.\nBakugou finally puts down his mug and starts talking about his speeches at local schools; and his plans to advocate for quirkless kids in the future; and about Isao and his seaweed-green hair littered with twigs, and his bloody face, and his mother, who had smiled with such exhaustion, like she was used to seeing her son injured by snot-nosed little punks.\nDeku gets quiet. Eerily quiet. He stares down at his cooling coffee. Bakugou leans back against the couch, hand running idly through Barkgou\u2019s fur, and waits.\n\u201cKacchan,\u201d Deku finally says, \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing, it makes me happy, but \u2026 I think I want to be the one to speak out for quirkless kids.\u201d\nBakugou doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be quirkless. This is Deku\u2019s territory. He won\u2019t argue with him, won\u2019t talk over the top of him, but\u2014\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell people you were quirkless. That\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d\nDeku scowls. For all the years the nerd spent trying to shed the title of quirkless, it\u2019s a badge he wants to pull out again, to wave to the world, and a part of that annoys Bakugou\u2014the same part of him he\u2019s fought for years to overcome\u2014but he understands it, too. Deku wants other quirkless people to know they\u2019re not alone. That they\u2019re not worthless.\nDeku received One for All and rose from the bottom of the scrap heap to the near-top of the hero ranks. But he isn\u2019t the only quirkless person in Japan. There are other people out there that didn\u2019t inherit a god-like quirk. People that will never have a quirk. People that will never be able to dodge the constant barrage of abuse that comes with being quirkless.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Deku says, \u201cbut I did spent 15 years as a quirkless kid. That counts for something.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid and impulsive,\u201d Bakugou says.\nDeku smiles sunnily at him. \u201cMe? Impulsive? It\u2019s like you don\u2019t know me, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you before any of the villains get the chance.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA few days later, Deku sits down with a reputable interviewer. He\u2019s wearing a new suit\u2014a proper tailed suit with a blazer and buffed oxford shoes, rather than his hero costume\u2014and someone has tied his tie for him so that it lays flat.\nDeku doesn\u2019t do that thing he usually does in front of the press, where he flails his hands and laughs like he\u2019s back at school, sitting in the cafeteria room sandwiched between Iida and Uraraka, grinning that megawatt grin, treating the media like they\u2019re old friends\u2014a technique he perfected after years of intense media scrutiny.\nThis time, Deku is oddly somber as he sits down. He thanks the interviewer for her time, and then, with minimal prompting, starts talking about being quirkless in a quirk-dominated society.\nBakugou watches the entire interview when it airs, coiled tightly around a throw pillow, plucking at the beadwork . Kirishima sits beside him, watching patiently.\nDeku talks until his voice is hoarse. He talks about the hope and then crushing realisation when his fourth and fifth birthday came and went without a quirk manifesting; he talks about how everyone in the neighbourhood spoke in hushed tones around him for years; how they all offered condolences to his mother, like she had birthed a terminally ill child, rather than a quirkless one; how it didn\u2019t take long for the other kids to ostracise him; how his classmates\u2019 sly remarks grew worse and worse, until it festered into outright violence; how teachers had ignored or even encouraged everyone\u2019s poor behaviour. He talks about isolation, and loneliness, and feeling like you were broken, like your body was defective, because the world told you that if you didn\u2019t have a quirk, you were incomplete.\n\u201cDeku,\u201d he says, clearing his throat, \u201cis another way to read Izuku. It means worthless. It was my childhood nickname.\u201d\nKirishima watches Bakugou throughout the interview. Kirishima knows about his and Deku\u2019s toxic childhood. He knew, even before this interview, that Deku had meant something terrible before Uraraka had rebranded it. He had known that Bakugou had arrived at UA with a fistful of smoke and that spiteful nickname twisted on his lips.\nKirishima knows everything, but he\u2019s so gentle. He reaches out, uncurls Bakugou\u2019s hand from where it\u2019s strangling the pillow in a death grip, and links their fingers together. He doesn\u2019t say anything. He just sits there with Bakugou, and it\u2019s enough.\nDeku does a lot of fast talking towards the end of the interview about quirks developing in adolescence\u2014incredibly rare, but not unheard of. He says something about his quirk waiting until his body was big enough to not be completely ripped to shreds by its own power before manifesting, a neat explanation for the way Deku had famously broken all of his bones during their first sports festival.\nDeku doesn\u2019t mention any names in the interview. And not once\u2014despite it being common knowledge that they had grown up together\u2014does Deku or the interviewer mention Bakugou. He must have told her not to, beforehand.\nBakugou kind of hates him for that.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAge 18\n\n\u00a0\nBakugou pushes himself out of bed, taking his IV and its stand with him (because all UA students have had that lecture from Recovery Girl), and hobbles into the hall.\nThey\u2019re treating Deku in the same hospital. The nurse had told him that much. He\u2019s even in a nearby room; they\u2019re probably keeping the heroes close by for security reasons.\nBakugou opens the door with his wrists and elbows, since his hands are swathed in bandages, and almost wrenches his IV out trying to squeeze through the gap. The fact that he finds a door heavy tells him how exhausted he really is.\nDeku\u2019s room is a mirror of his. He\u2019s asleep on the single bed. Bakugou drags himself over to the beside chair, and sits quietly, watching the rise and fall of Deku\u2019s chest. His face is puffy, swelling up like ripened fruit. His arms are in casts. Judging from the lump beneath the blankets, his right leg is broken, too.\nBakugou isn\u2019t sure exactly what he\u2019s doing there. He\u2019s half-convinced it\u2019s the drugs and left over battle-instinct that made him find Deku; after fighting near him for hours, it makes sense that he\u2019d seek him out.\nBut there\u2019s something about this moment that gives him pause. The hum of the machines keeping Deku breathing. The gauzy curtains over the propped window doing little to block out the light, dust motes floating in a wide sunbeam. The absence of rage within him when he looks at Deku, replaced by this new, strange feeling. The newfound respect he has for him. It stops Bakugou from getting up and storming out.\nDeku\u2019s eyes crack open. He squints at Bakugou.\n\u201cKacchan \u2026 ?\u201d\nBakugou pushes his hands together. His palms are so overworked that he can barely feel the sting as he aggregates his injuries.\n\u201cDeku.\u201d Bakugou blows out a breath. \u201cMidoriya. I have something to say. I think it\u2019s probably overdue.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAge 21\n\n\u00a0\nBakugou\u2019s next talk is at his former middle school. His former classmates are adults, and half the teachers have probably moved on, but\u2014\nBut it feels right, going back. Making amends here of all places.\nBakugou wonders if their former teachers and classmates from middle school watched Deku\u2019s interview and knew he was talking about them. He wonders if they see Deku\u2019s smiling face everywhere, on t-shirts and billboards and the news every other night, and realise how fucking successful that small, seemingly useless kid in their class became. More successful than any of those lowlifes, anyway.\nBakugou is in his hero suit, minus the grenade gauntlets and some body armour. The principal meets him at the front door. They shake hands. The principal introduces himself, and Bakugou immediately forgets his name.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very proud to have a high ranked hero come from our middle school,\u201d says the principal. \u201cYou\u2019re the star of our alumni\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTwo,\u201d Bakugou says.\n\u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cTwo heroes came from this shitty school. And Deku is ranked higher than me.\u201d For the moment, anyway.\nThe principal stares at him for a moment, and then seems to realise who Bakugou is talking about. Bakugou would have doubted that any of the staff remembered a nervous, quirkless kid like Deku at all, but they probably keep an updated list of past students somewhere, and Bakugou and Deku are both so outrageously, disgustingly famous that they would have all had to have lived at the bottom of the ocean not to know who they are. It probably says what middle school they went to on each of their goddamn Wikipedia pages.\nBakugou wonders if the principal had seen the interview, too. He must have. No wonder he doesn\u2019t want to draw attention to the fact that a rising hero originated from this shitty school when said hero had a terrible school life before entering UA.\nThe principal smiles. \u201cRight, of course. He was so quiet, and you were so boisterous, I forgot\u2014\u201d\n\u201cQuiet?\u201d Bakugou repeats.\nThe principal plasters on that rubbery smile again, the same smile all the two-bit reporters and politicians and PR reps wear. \u201cWe\u2019re honoured to have you here. Would you like me to accompany you to the gymnasium?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to acknowledge it, huh?\u201d The principal\u2019s smile doesn\u2019t waver. Bakugou clucks his tongue, and reaches for his phone, swiping it open and pulling up Twitter, angling the screen so the principal can see. \u201cI\u2019m here to give a speech about bullying\u2014something you apparently know fuck all about. How many kids have you ignored over the years? How many kids were chewed up and spit out right under your nose? I wonder what the public would think about that. Sounds like a safety issue to me.\u201d\n\u201cSir\u2014\u201d The principal makes an aborted motion to grab Bakugou\u2019s phone, but stops himself. Smart. Bakugou doesn\u2019t think he could stop himself from blowing the fucker\u2019s face off if he actually touched him with his sweaty hands.\n\u201cDo you know how popular Deku is?\u201d Bakugou says it because it needs to be said, because Deku isn\u2019t here to say it himself, even though Deku deserves to say it, to spit it out beneath clenched teeth, to make this bastard in a cheap suit squirm after the shit he went through as a kid. Deku isn\u2019t that kind of person, though. Bakugou will have to be that person for him. \u201cWhat do you think would happen if the media found out exactly how this middle school treated a rising hero? They already know Deku was spat on as a kid, should we give them an address so they can come down here and interrogate you themselves?\u201d\n\u201cIf this whole thing was an attempt to blackmail the school,\u201d the principal starts, and Bakugou laughs in his face.\n\u201cBlackmail? What the fuck would I possibly want from you?\u201d\nThe principal glances to the side like he wants to run from this conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I won\u2019t stand for it.\u201d\nBakugou grabs his lapels and hauls him closer, until the principal is standing on his tip-toes, staring up into Bakugou\u2019s red eyes. He stops breathing.\n\u201cI want,\u201d Bakugou says, \u201cyou to wake the fuck up. Make teachers look out for their kids. Don\u2019t put up with any kind of violence\u2014this should be a fucking safe space for kids. And the little shit-stains who think they\u2019re above the rules because they\u2019ve got a fancy quirk? You deal with them, too. Quirk usage is illegal. Physical assault is illegal. And yet I saw all that and more when I was here\u2014I did all of that and more when I was here.\u201d\nBakugou isn\u2019t sure who he\u2019s angrier at\u2014the principal sweating profusely in front of him, the scores of teachers who saw kids lay their filthy hands on Deku and never lifted a finger to help him, their nameless former classmates who graduated and went on to work nine-to-five jobs and live in the suburbs, who never spared a thought for the quirkless kid they spent years ridiculing, or the entire fucking system for setting up quirkless kids to fail. Or himself.\nThe principal stares at him. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you wanted us to give you detention?\u201d\nDetention. Like that would have done anything.\n\u201cI\u2019m saying,\u201d Bakugou says through gritted teeth, \u201cthat you should\u2019ve expelled me.\u201d\nThe principal says something else, but Bakugou is done with this conversation. He drops the principal and stalks off to find the gymnasium on his own, shaking with anger.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe finds the gymnasium, but before he goes inside, he ducks into a unisex bathroom, and calls Kirishima. He\u2019s on his lunch break, just back from an early morning patrol, and talks Bakugou patiently through breathing exercises, and then chatters mindlessly for a while until Bakugou feels less like he\u2019s going to snap in half.\nIt feels weird being back here. The graffiti in the bathroom is new, but the mottled blue tiles are exactly how he remembers. It\u2019s like he\u2019s travelled almost ten years into the past.\n\u201cKatsuki,\u201d Kirishima says, \u201cit\u2019s okay for you to be struggling with this. I know you didn\u2019t have a hard time the way Midoriya did, but you still weren\u2019t in a good head space when you were a kid\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI have to go.\u201d Bakugou\u2019s voice echoes in the small, watery bathroom.\nKirishima pauses, and then says, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\nBakugou closes his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this so people can be proud\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud. This is a very you thing to do.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck does that mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a hero, babe.\u201d\n\u201cI have to go,\u201d Bakugou says again, but this time, his voice is less gruff, and the knot in his chest isn\u2019t so stifling. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u201cLove you, too. Knock \u2018em dead.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe gymnasium looks different. The basketball hoops folded up against the far wall are new. The wood panels aren\u2019t scuffed like he remembers; the floor has been buffed recently, shining under his boots. The curtains over the stage are pulled back.\nA teacher leads him backstage. He doesn\u2019t recognise her. She seems fairly decent\u2014steady hands, a strong smile, none of the hero awe that the student council member beside her is displaying. But then again, plenty of people seem competent on the outside when they\u2019re actually twisted up on the inside.\nThe kid next to her, some committee member from the student council, stares up at Bakugou. His eyes are huge. Jesus Christ, had Bakugou ever been that young?\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m\u2014\u201d says the kid, but the teacher says, a touch too sharply, \u201cTakeda.\u201d\nTakeda bows his head. Bakugou stares at the teacher dead in the eye until she shuts her mouth. I see you, Bakugou thinks. Do you think I don\u2019t fucking see?\n\u201cYou are?\u201d Bakugou prompts. Takeda looks to his frowning teacher instead of answering, so Bakugou says, \u201cI went to this middle school. Did they tell you that?\u201d\nTakeda\u2019s eyes snap to his face. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. It was really shitty, looking back. Is it any better?\u201d\nTakeda shuffles in place. \u201c \u2026 Yes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie to me, kid. I\u2019m sure most middle schools are the same. Guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m here, trying to change that.\u201d\nTakeda chews on his lips, and Bakugou waits patiently. He learned this technique from Aizawa\u2014if you wait, they\u2019ll come to you. He always used it on villains. Now, he\u2019s using it on kids, just like Aizawa did.\nFucking hell, if he\u2019s not careful, he\u2019s going to wind up teaching these brats, and that would be a disaster. Who would want Bakugou as a teacher?\n\u201cI\u2019m a fan,\u201d Takeda says finally. \u201cI really like your wrist-bands. I want to build hero gadgets when I\u2019m older, but I know that that\u2019s kind of boring \u2026 \u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not boring,\u201d Bakugou says. \u201cI know people who work in support. They\u2019re piss-your-pants terrifying. More terrifying than the actual heroes. And my grenades have saved my life and my friends\u2019 lives more times than I can count.\u201d\nTakeda doesn\u2019t say anything, but he looks up at Bakugou without any shyness. If the kid didn\u2019t have scales creeping up his face and a working set of gills on his neck, he would think that Takeda\u2019s quirk put actual stars in his eyes. The thought reminds him of Deku, eternally starry eyed, and Bakugou wants to punch something; everything here reminds him of Deku, and he hates it.\nAfter that, the teacher ushers him on stage, and Bakugou lets himself be herded in front of a hoard of puberty-ridden students. The sooner he says what needs to said, the sooner he can get Deku out of his head.\nHe stands behind the lectern, staring out at rows of chairs filling the gymnasium, and wets his lips, and starts.\nHe says, \u201cI was a student here a few years ago. I was top of my year, and I wouldn\u2019t let anyone even look at me wrong, because I thought I was on top of the world. I was a stupid piece of shit.\u201d\nThe crowd shuffles in their seats. A teacher standing in the wings grimaces, but Bakugou ignores her. If they can\u2019t handle his swearing or the ugly truth, then they shouldn\u2019t have invited him.\nHe tugs the microphone off the stand, and walks around the lectern, one hand stuffed in his pocket. This talk feels different than the last.\nBakugou says, \u201cI thought I was the best of the best, so I treated everyone around me like shit, and it ended up backfiring in my face. I\u2019m here to tell you to treat the kids around you with respect, but I know that you\u2019re probably all selfish teenagers who won\u2019t give a fuck if you\u2019re pushing some kid around, or if you\u2019re telling other people to go kill themselves\u2014that is, you won\u2019t give a fuck until it comes back to bite you in the ass. And I\u2019m telling you right now, it will bite you in the ass.\u201d\nHe says, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to trick you into playing nice and eating your fucking veggies. I\u2019m telling you all this so that you\u2019ll get your heads out of your asses. I\u2019m giving you the wake up call I wish someone had beaten into my skull when I was a kid.\u201d\nHe says, \u201cI spent ten years hurting Deku, and the both of us have to live with that for the rest of our lives, no matter how many times I apologise and try to make up for what I did. You might think you\u2019re above everyone else now because you have money, or a powerful quirk, or whatever the fuck else, but one day you\u2019re going to wake up and realise that everyone isn\u2019t beneath you. They\u2019re going to catch up. And you\u2019re going to be too busy lauding it up and making other people feel small that you can\u2019t see your own weaknesses.\u201d\nHe says, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to threaten you into being obedient students. I\u2019m trying to help. Take my advice.\u201d\nHis lecture doesn\u2019t last the entire hour. It barely lasts forty minutes. He sits down at the edge of the stage, arms braced on his knees, and lets the kids ask him questions. Some of them aren\u2019t even about this topic, and he shuts them down.\nLots of them are about Deku.\n\u201cI thought you and Deku were friends,\u201d says one student, a girl who barely looks old enough to be in middle school.\n\u201cWe are,\u201d Bakugou says evenly. \u201cWe weren\u2019t when we were your age. I was a shit-head to him when I was younger. But I think we\u2019re friends now.\u201d\n\u201cHow did he forgive you for what you did to him?\u201d She probably wouldn\u2019t even reach his shoulders, but her gaze chills him right through.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Bakugou says, and even after all he\u2019s said today, this visceral honesty leaves him feeling stripped bare in a way he normally only feels during therapy sessions. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I deserve that forgiveness, but he gave it to me without hesitating, because that\u2019s the kind of person he is.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of person is he?\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding me? Deku is fucking Deku.\u201d The disbelief in his tone gets a laugh from the kids. Bakugou wasn\u2019t exaggerating about their fame. They all know how sunny and forgiving Deku is.\nThe girl sits down, and someone else gets up. A shifty-eyed boy with his shirt hanging out of his pants. Bakugou thinks, I got you, you little shit-stain, but he doesn\u2019t let anything show on his face.\n\u201cHow did you decide to be better?\u201d\n\u201cI was an oblivious little fucker when I entered UA, and I had to go through a lot of crap before I got a proper wake up call, and then it was even longer before I actually managed to work through all my issues and apologise. Working to be a good person isn\u2019t a single decision. It\u2019s about trying to be better every single day.\u201d\nThe questions keep coming, and then the bell for lunch rings through the gymnasium. Some of the kids stick around even while their classmates file off for lunch. Bakugou signs autographs, and takes a few begrudging photos, and privately talks to the nervous kids who come up to him with more questions about what to do if you\u2019re being bullying, or how to be better, or what exactly he had meant when he had said, It\u2019s time to make a choice; it\u2019s time to decide what kind of person you\u2019re going to be.\nBakugou talks to them in a quiet, almost gentle voice, until the teachers have to move them on. He leaves the school feeling light-headed. Had he really just done that?\nHe doesn\u2019t know if he made any real difference, if any of the kids will really take his words to heart, but he tried. He\u2019s never believed in that congratulatory bullshit about the effort being as important as the outcome, but\u2014\nBut maybe someone going through something awful will hear him and feel bolstered. Maybe other heroes will step forward and help after hearing about his efforts. He doesn\u2019t check the group chat regularly, but Kirishima says the others have been making noise about joining him in speaking out about bullying.\nAnd maybe this will make Deku feel better. Even a little bit.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAge 18\n\n\u201cThere was a moment,\u201d Bakugou says without stuttering, even though his tongue feels too big for his mouth, \u201cwhen we were out there. I saw Shigaraki. You were busy, but I saw him. I don\u2019t think that stupid fuck even realised I was there.\u201d\n\u201cKacchan,\u201d Deku says hoarsely.\nBakugou barrels on, because if he doesn\u2019t get this out now, he might never say it. \u201cThere was this family, and Moonfish was nearby, staring at them like he wanted to fucking eat them. But they were down the street, not directly in front of me, and Shigaraki was in my line of sight. I could\u2019ve ignored them. I could\u2019ve taken him out. No one would have even questioned it.\u201d\nThe hospital is a soft buzz of noise outside of Deku\u2019s room. Someone will come looking for him when they find his bed empty. Where will they think Bakugou has gone? Will they think he\u2019s ditched the hospital altogether, or will they think to check Deku\u2019s room?\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d Bakugou finishes. \u201cI turned around and stopped Moonfish instead.\u201d\nDeku blinks at him. The IVs must be feeding them a shitload of drugs. Deku\u2019s eyes are glassy, and Bakugou suddenly rethinks this entire plan. Can he even understand what Bakugou is saying?\nBut then Deku smiles\u2014that stupid smile where his eyes crinkle up and his teeth show\u2014and says, \u201cI knew it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a hero, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cI know. You want to see my license?\u201d\nDeku shakes his head, and Bakugou almost doesn\u2019t want to hear what he knows is coming next. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. You\u2019re a hero. The real kind. The kind that makes people feel safe.\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m there,\u201d Bakugou says, mostly under his breathe, and it\u2019s definitely the drugs making him say that childish shit. But Deku hears, and smiles again, that same too-bright smile that makes his puffy, bruised up face look like squashed fruit.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Bakugou blurts.\nThe smile fades. \u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\u201cEverything.\u201d His heart is pounding in his chest. The words bubble up his throat before he\u2019s even thought about stopping them. \u201cFor treating you way I did when we were kids. For letting everyone else treat you like shit, too\u2014for encouraging them. For going after after you when we got to UA. For everything I said, and did, and the way I kept stomped on your dream, even though I wasn\u2019t worth shit\u2014\u201d\nDeku\u2019s hand rests on his. Bandaged fingers jut out from beneath his plaster cast. Bakugou\u2019s hands, wrapped thickly in gauze, don\u2019t register Deku\u2019s touch. His nerves are too wrecked.\n\u201cI already forgave you,\u201d Midoriya says.\n\u201cFuck off.\u201d\n\u201cBut the apology was definitely nice. Kind of needed, too, in it\u2019s own way. Though you didn\u2019t pick a very good time for this, Kacchan. We almost died. The whole city almost died.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this is the right time.\u201d Bakugou wets his cracked lips, and says, once more, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Midoriya says.\nBakugou almost tells him about what he saw on the TV. The way the entire country is grieving and celebrating in turn, how they\u2019re already drawing parallels between Deku, the determined seventeen year old who took down Shigaraki, and All Might. Bakugou almost tells him that he\u2019ll surpass him and become the next Number One, regardless of what the news is saying.\nA nurse\u2019s plastic shoes squeak on the vinyl floor, probably coming to check on them. Bakugou is so tired. This will have to wait for another day.\nBakugou isn\u2019t stupid; he knows they\u2019re going to have to have more conversations like his one. The rift between them will take years to mend, and they\u2019ve only just started.\nBut they\u2019ve got their whole lives ahead of them to do it. Graduation might be fast approaching, but the hero industry is small. Their circle of mutual of friends is even smaller. And the thing between them, this cocktail of respect and rivalry and shared history, has welded them together.\nThis apology is only just beginning, Bakugou knows. They have a long way to go. But they\u2019ll get there in the end.\n\u00a0"
