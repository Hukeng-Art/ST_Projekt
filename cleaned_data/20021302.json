    "text": "\u201cYou\u2019re not even going to give me a hint?\u201d Wei Wuxian has his head against the table, his arms splayed so that his long sleeves drape over the sides. \u201cCome on, who is it?\u201d\nJiang Cheng, primly seated in a chair pulled out from the table, one leg crossed over the other, scoffs. \u201cYou think they\u2019d let me pick? They barely agreed to this in the first place.\u201d\nWei Wuxian hums. He might\u2019ve guessed that. He still doesn\u2019t know whether he expected Jiang Cheng to stand beside him; all he knows is that he\u2019s grateful his brother did. He\u2019s not sure what would\u2019ve happened if he\u2019d had to take on the burden of protecting the remnants of the Wen clan by himself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like there are very many options,\u201d he says. \u201cUnmarried cultivators who\u2019ve never taken to bed with anyone, willing to lie with the Yiling Patriarch?\u201d His laughter echoes through the room.\nJiang Cheng wrinkles his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s the willing part you have to worry about. You were never as good at flirting as you thought you were, even before you became the cultivation world\u2019s boogie man.\u201d \nWei Wuxian clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. \u201cNo need to be jealous, Jiang Cheng. I\u2019m sure as Sect Leader, you\u2019ll find a partner soon enough.\u201d\nHis brother rolls his eyes, kicking Wei Wuxian with one leg under the table. \u201cIt\u2019s not me we should be worried about. Or have you forgotten how serious this is? The entire cultivation world is ready to tear you apart, for standing between them and the Wen clan, for having this power of demonic cultivation! Can you be serious?\u201d \nThis finally sobers him. He blinks his dark eyes, feels the heavy emptiness in his chest and the buzzing distraction of his mind. Jiang Cheng can\u2019t know just how serious this is, how much the use of demonic cultivation is truly affecting him. If he did know, what would he do? Would he still stand by Wei Wuxian? \n\u201cI am serious,\u201d he says softly. \u201cIt was my suggestion, wasn\u2019t it? If I complete the ritual, the other clans will have nothing to fear. At least, nothing they can act on without appearing like hypocrites.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jiang Cheng agrees, with a sigh. \u201cBut leaving the choice up to them wouldn\u2019t have been my preference.\u201d\nIdly, Wei Wuxian considers who it might be. The Sunshot Campaign had decimated the ranks of young cultivators, but that affected the men more than the women. As a result, there\u2019s been a flurry of marriages over the last couple of months, Jiang Yanli\u2019s included. Wei Wuxian can\u2019t imagine that the leaders of the cultivation world would be so depraved as to suggest his shijie as a possible candidate, but in any case he\u2019s glad the option\u2019s off the table. \n\u201cWen Qing is unwed,\u201d Wei Wuxian considers. \u201cThat might be a way of punishing us both.\u201d\nJiang Cheng huffs a breath. \u201cThey\u2019d never trust a Wen. It\u2019d be too easy for the two of you to lie, and say you\u2019d done it when you hadn\u2019t.\u201d\nWei Wuxian offers him a crooked smile. \u201cI think they\u2019re all overestimating how well she thinks of me, to think that Wen Qing would lie for me.\u201d \nEven as he says it, he knows it isn\u2019t true. Wen Qing had come to him for help, and together they\u2019d saved Wen Ning when he was on the brink of death. Wei Wuxian had rescued the rest of the Wen clan, and is now standing with them, asserting their right to live in peace. He\u2019s even gotten Yunmeng Jiang to stand with them, against all expectations. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Jiang Cheng mutters, still thinking. \u201cIt has to be someone no one will question. Someone who\u2019s integrity is beyond reproach. Someone who\u2019s righteous light can combat even\u2026\u201d He raises a brow, indicating Wei Wuxian\u2019s dark robes, Chenqing at his waist. \nWei Wuxian barks a harsh laugh. \u201cNot many people so pure, especially not after the war!\u201d \nJiang Cheng reaches forward, lays a strong hand against Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThey won\u2019t\u2014 it won\u2019t be anyone who would hurt you. That would be against the whole point. So, don\u2019t worry. You have to make it through this. It\u2019s the only way to keep you safe, and get the target off your back.\u201d \nMaybe Jiang Cheng sensed the tenor of panic in Wei Wuxian\u2019s laughter. Now, he places a hand over his brother\u2019s and sighs deeply.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize, Jiang Cheng. I know you did this for me. And it was my idea. I knew what I was getting myself into.\u201d \nIt\u2019s an ancient right, one used to purify the soul and strengthen the core. A form of dual cultivation that draws out all darkness and resentful energy, and replaces it with something stronger and less erratic.\nWei Wuxian doesn\u2019t think it will work the same way for him, not when he\u2019s missing a golden core and has been steeped in resentful energy for so long. But maybe it\u2019ll alleviate some of the echoing, frantic voices building in the back of his mind. Maybe it\u2019ll help him clear his head. Maybe, it\u2019ll stop him from falling into the abyss that haunts his dreams. \nHe takes a deep breath. \u201cOne purified Yiling Patriarch, coming up.\u201d \n\u2014\nHe didn\u2019t get a good look at the chamber before the blindfold was slipped over his eyes. Pure black silk, he can\u2019t see anything through it. The last time he\u2019d worn such a thing, he\u2019d been out in nature. He could feel the earth beneath his boots, hear the wind whistling through the trees. There had been other senses to help him along, the least of which wasn\u2019t his ability to sense malevolent corpses and resentful energy. \nThe surface he\u2019s sitting on now is smooth, cool like stone. The chamber is utterly silent. His hands are folded neatly in front of him, his legs dangling over the ceremonial dais. He wears a loose, simple robe of dark gray. All other garments had been removed before entering.\nFor all that he jokes about experience, for all that he teases Jiang Cheng for his lack of charm, Wei Wuxian\u2019s never done this before. He never imagined a first time with such high stakes, with so little control.\nDespite the coolness of the chamber, a bead of sweat drips down his face.\nA door opens and then shuts on the other side of the room. The sudden noise startles him, and Wei Wuxian looks up, following the sound. Quiet, even footsteps pad across the floor. \nThey\u2019re here. \nWei Wuxian clenches his hands, but they\u2019re shaking. There are so many risks, here. What if the chosen cultivator discovers Wei Wuxian\u2019s missing golden core? What if they reveal that weakness to the entire world, leaving Wei Wuxian and the Wens and Yunmeng Jiang vulnerable? What if they take advantage of Wei Wuxian\u2019s state to see him brought low, weak and humiliated? What if\u2014\nLarge, cold hands grip both of his, bringing them together in a firm clasp. The touch is comforting, solid. Wei Wuxian lets out a hollow sob of relief.\nThe person leans forward, and Wei Wuxian feels smooth hair brush against his cheeks, his clavicle. Then, he loses track of all else when a pair of perfect lips presses against his own. \nAh. How could he have ever thought this person would hurt him? They kiss with such fervor, but all the while they stroke Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands, like they want to comfort him. The kiss steals Wei Wuxian\u2019s breath, but it also stops him from thinking. Light-headed, his worries seem far away. \nThe person pulls back for a moment, only to lean in and kiss Wei Wuxian again. \nFinally, his mind and memories catch up to the physical sensations. Wei Wuxian knows this kiss. This is the only person who\u2019s ever kissed him.\nBreathless, he asks, \u201cI know you.\u201d\nFor a moment, there\u2019s only silence. Then, \u201cMn.\u201d\nHis heart thunders in his chest. \u201cLan Zhan?\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\nBefore he can help it, laughter bubbles out of him. His whole chest shakes with it. But really, who would have thought! The purest of them all, the most righteous\u2014 Hanguang-Jun himself, being pushed into this role! Perhaps they thought no one else was strong enough to not be taken in by Wei Wuxian\u2019s wickedness. Perhaps they never intended to sacrifice a maiden to the task. But\u2014 Lan Wangji! Honestly, how dare they ask something so base of him? \n\u201cWei Ying.\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s hands move up to Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders, holding him firmly. \u201cAre you nervous.\u201d\nIf Wei Wuxian could see him, there might be an indication of question in the slight bow of Lan Wangji\u2019s head, the just-barely-visible tilt of his brows. Now, all he has to go on is Lan Wangji\u2019s even-toned, melodious voice, and the feel of his hands against Wei Wuxian\u2019s body, only the thin robe separating them.\nHe shudders.\n\u201cWei Ying.\u201d\nWei Wuxian shakes him off, crosses his arms over his chest. \u201cWhy does everyone keep asking me that? I\u2019m the one who adapted the ritual for this purpose, I\u2019m the one who suggested it! It\u2019s not some great burden, is it? To bed someone in order to be deemed pure and acceptable, again?\u201d\nHe knows they\u2019re all scared of him. The sidelong glances and whispers had started as soon as he\u2019d returned from the Burial Mounds. The more he did, the more he killed and terrified during the Sunshot Campaign, the more distant even his own allies became. And then he\u2019d seen what they\u2019d done to Wen Ning, and his mind had nearly shattered with rage. If Wen Ning had been dead, he doesn\u2019t know what he would've done. \nHis breathing is ragged, his mind far away, when Lan Wangji begins to gently stroke his hair back from the crown of his head. He follows the path of Wei Wuxian\u2019s skull, down to the base of his neck, and his musician's fingers are so skilled that Wei Wuxian groans with a relief he hasn\u2019t felt in months, perhaps years. \nHe wants to lean forward into this touch, sees no reason to hold himself back. Lan Wangji might look down on his methods of cultivation, might have preferred to imprison Wei Wuxian in seclusion until he found a way to purify himself. But Lan Wangji isn\u2019t cruel. He isn\u2019t harsh, or violent. Wei Wuxian can trust him. \n\u201cHow\u2019d they ever get you to agree to this,\u201d Wei Wuxian wonders aloud.\n\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, and maybe it\u2019s wishful thinking, but Wei Wuxian imagines his lips turning up just slightly, almost fond.\n\u2014\nLan Wangji moves to secure his wrists, and Wei Wuxian panics. He can\u2019t see, can only feel a cool touch, and suddenly he\u2019s back in the Burial Mounds. Streams of resentful energy had held him down, then, cold enough to blacken skin but somehow still burning. He\u2019d screamed and thrashed, but there\u2019d been no getting away from it, and without a golden core he had no power, no means of fighting back. The energy surrounded him, drowned him, forcing its way into his mouth and down his throat\u2014\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and there\u2019s a mournful tone to his normally melodious voice. He\u2019s secured Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands to either side of the dais with lengths of silk, but now he\u2019s gently rubbing his fingers over Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrists, soothing him.\nThe touch is cool, not freezing. Warmth gathers in his skin, not a burning sensation, but a gentle comfort. \nWei Wuxian takes in a deep breath, then releases it as slowly as he can. He can feel Lan Wangji\u2019s shadow on him, can imagine those golden eyes taking in every inch of him\u2014 his long, loose hair; his open robe, revealing the scars across his chest, some surgical and some won in battle, along with the Wen brand; his legs, still hanging over the dais, trembling.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian moans, when he feels Lan Wangji\u2019s careful hands trail the length of his arms, down to his chest, then his stomach.\n\u201cMn?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so distracting,\u201d Wei Wuxian complains, trying for a laugh. And indeed, every time Wei Wuxian\u2019s mind tries to take him back to a dark place, Lan Wangji\u2019s touch is there to ground him, to remind him where he is. It feels\u2026 good. Wei Wuxian likes it when Lan Wangji touches him. \n\u201cWei Ying has something else to focus on?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, bland and straight-faced as ever.\nWei Wuxian chokes another laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant\u2014\u201d \nOh. That\u2019s Lan Wangji\u2019s tongue, in his mouth. Lan Wangji\u2019s strong hands circling his wrists. If he\u2019s this close, if Wei Wuxian can feel his clothed chest brushed against his own bare one, then Lan Wangji must have climbed onto the dais. He\u2019s crouched over him, holding him down, and kissing into his mouth, licking into him, biting his lips\u2014\n\u201cAh\u2014 ah\u2014 Lan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian gasps for breath when Lan Wangji pulls away, his chest heaving.\n\u201cMn?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, and is it Wei Wuxian\u2019s imagination, or is he also struggling for air? Wei Wuxian can feel Lan Wangji\u2019s breath ghosting over his face, before he pulls back.\n\u201cWho\u2014 who knew you\u2019d be so good at this?\u201d Really, despite being number two on the list of eligible young masters, Lan Wangji shouldn\u2019t be so skilled! Or maybe it isn\u2019t skill, but the sheer force of him, overwhelming and grounding all at once. Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t know how to kiss like that! He can\u2019t even use any leverage to press back into the kisses, and probably feels like sucking on a fish. How disgraceful!\nOr maybe it doesn\u2019t matter. He was the fourth-ranked young master, once upon a time, but even then he\u2019d never given much thought to marriage. He wasn\u2019t like Shijie or Jiang Cheng. He has no responsibility to continue a dynasty or forge political connections through marriage. The entire thought of romance has always been far away for him, outside of the fun of teasing pretty girls or admiring others\u2019 looks from afar. \nHe\u2019d never managed to keep his distance from Lan Wangji, though. From the first, everything about Lan Zhan had drawn him in and refused to let him go.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says suddenly, seriously. One of his hands rests lightly on Wei Wuxian\u2019s bare chest, making him shudder.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that,\u201d Wei Wuxian teases, \u201cDo you like saying my name, so much?\u201d \nLan Wangji must shake his head, because loose strands of his hair brush across Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin, tickling him. \n\u201cIs this what you want,\u201d Lan Wangji says. The words come slow and deliberate, like stones being placed on a scale to measure the weight of gold. Each one is careful and precise, their meaning perfectly clear. \nFor some reason, Wei Wuxian is trembling. He wants to tease Lan Wangji some more, wants to come up with some cute, deflecting excuse. Instead, he blurts out, \u201cI have to.\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s hand clenches slightly, where it\u2019s braced against Wei Wuxian\u2019s back. \u201cWei Wuxian\u2026 does not follow rules.\u201d\nWei Wuxian laughs, his voice shaking, \u201cI do so! At least, when they suit me, or I want to, or they\u2019re not keeping me from doing something important! It\u2019s just that Gusu has too many! No one could follow them all!\u201d\nA stupid thing to say to one of the Twin Jades of Lan. But then, haven\u2019t so many of Wei Wuxian\u2019s choices up until now been stupid?\n\u201cWei Wuxian\u2026 does not follow rules simply to follow them,\u201d Lan Wangji amends. There\u2019s a deep quality to his voice, something that Wei Wuxian might categorize as awe or respect under different circumstances. But there\u2019s no way Lan Wangji admires him for his rule-breaking. That\u2019s utterly insane. \n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Wei Wuxian agrees. \u201cBut this\u2014 I made my decision, before I came. If I don\u2019t let this happen, the other sects will keep looking at Yunmeng Jiang as a threat. They\u2019ll keep coming after the Wens. I can\u2019t keep them all safe, not just by fighting them back by myself. I need to release the tension. Until they all get back on their feet.\u201d\nLan Wangji hums a low note, an indication that he\u2019s listening intently. \nWei Wuxian can feel his heart beating up against his chest, like it\u2019s struggling to be held in Lan Wangji\u2019s palm.\n\u201cHow\u2019d you even get roped into this, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian babbles. \u201cDid Gusu Lan take pity on me, and send a righteous cultivator that no one could disagree with?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says simply.\n\u201cNo?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says again. \u201cI chose.\u201d\nLightning strikes him through the chest, as though the sensation is being directed through Lan Wangji\u2019s hand where it meets his skin. Lan Wangji wants to sleep with him? Even though he\u2019s a demonic cultivator, a rule-breaker, a man? How could that possibly be?\nExcept that Lan Wangji isn\u2019t, cannot be, a liar. He does not waste words. So, if he\u2019s said so, it must be true.\n\u201cLan Zhan\u2026 wants to bed me?\u201d\nThe hand on his chest is shaking, slightly. \u201cMn.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian breaths out. \nThere\u2019s something\u2014 something powerful, about that. Lan Wangji wants to bed him. Lan Wangji wants to sleep with him. Lan Wangji wants to touch him, and kiss him. The immovable, implacable Second Master of Lan, with a face and principles both carved from jade, wants him.\n\u201cIs this a fantasy of yours?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. \u201cForcing all the demonic energy out of me with your\u2014\u201d \nLan Wangji claps a hand over his mouth. \u201cSilence, now.\u201d\n\u2014\nIt really is very hard to keep silent when he can feel Lan Wangji\u2019s breath against his groin, ghosting across his cock. In his wildest dreams and filthiest imaginings, he would never dare think of so defiling Lan Wangji.\nIt\u2019s really unfair that he doesn\u2019t get to see it.\nLan Wangji must be kneeling on the dais, his strong hands resting on Wei Wuxian\u2019s legs just under his knees. He strokes along Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin in a rhythmic pattern, so calming that Wei Wuxian\u2019s head falls back, and all he can focus on is the anticipation. Lan Wangji is breathing lightly against him, his touches as soft as crane\u2019s feathers on the wind. But he won\u2019t touch Wei Wuxian in the way he craves.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he whines. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to touch me, kiss me again. I\u2019m bored.\u201d\nLan Wangji must turn his head, because his lips press insistently against the soft skin of Wei Wuxian\u2019s inner thigh. \nWei Wuxian\u2019s legs shake as those kisses trail upwards, his muscles clenching in anticipation. No one\u2026 no one has ever touched him like this. No one has ever treated his body as something precious, something sacred. No one has ever given him affection in this most potent, intimate form. \n\u201cLan Zhan\u2026\u201d He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s about to say, but his voice shakes and then cuts off as Lan Wangji kisses the tip of his hardening cock. \u201cAh!\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s lips are against his cock, his hand still against Wei Wuxian\u2019s thigh. And now his lips are moving, caressing, licking ever so lightly at his skin, teasing him. Wei Wuxian\u2019s entire mind narrows in on that sensation, everything else blocked out, not seeing or hearing anything. It\u2019s just the cool, soft touch of Lan Wangji, of Lan Zhan, against his flushed skin. \n\u201cYou,\u201d he groans out, \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d \nThis is a purity ritual. It\u2019s meant to cleanse him, make him whole and acceptable once more. But instead, it\u2019s only pulling out his most depraved desires. He wants to see Lan Wangji\u2019s lips against his cock. He wants to\u2014 wants to\u2014 \n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he says, thoughts going fuzzy as Lan Wangji reaches upwards, stroking over his balls experimentally, reverently. \u201cNot to you, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d \nThe touches stop. Cool air blows against his exposed skin as Lan Wangji steps away from him. \nNo. That wasn\u2019t what he wanted. \u201cLan Zhan!\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and his voice is close, he hasn\u2019t moved very far away at all. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want me to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian insists, head shaking madly back and forth. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want it\u2014 want you! I do, but I can\u2019t! You\u2019re\u2014 I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\nA cool hand, perfect as white jade, brushes his hair back from his brow. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nHe chuckles out a nervous laugh, all his arrogance and artifice stripped away. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful, Lan Zhan.\u201d\nThe hand keeps brushing through his hair, so gentle it\u2019s painful to consider. \u201cTell me.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2014 if you keep touching me, like you were\u2014 then I\u2019m going to come.\u201d He hiccups out another laugh, his mind fighting between the intense heat the image stokes in him, and the shame of spilling out over Lan Wangji\u2019s perfect hands, his peerless face. \nHe\u2019d always meant demonic cultivation to be his own tool, his way of protecting others. He was never supposed to drag anyone else down with him! \nA long silence stretches between them, but Lan Wangji never stops gently stroking his face, his hair. \nFinally: \u201cYou can.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d His eyes widen behind the blindfold, but all he sees is darkness. \n\u201cYou can release,\u201d Lan Wangji says, as prim and reserved as ever. \u201cAnd again, when it is time.\u201d\nHe really can\u2019t keep talking like that, not in his deep, calm voice. It\u2019s as clear as the springs running through Gusu\u2019s mountains, as unwavering as the Lan clan\u2019s pure white banners hung from the railings. \n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whines. \u201cYou\u2019re so confident. But you\u2019ve never done this before, either. How can you be so sure you\u2019ll make me come twice?\u201d\nLan Wangji huffs out a breath, close to Wei Wuxian\u2019s ear. Then, if the flutter of fabric against Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin is anything to go by, he shifts down the dais once more to resume his former position. \n\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, \u201cDon\u2019t take that as a challenge\u2014\u201d\nIt\u2019s too late. Lan Wangji\u2019s lips are against his cock again, his fingers gently tapping against Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin like he\u2019s plucking his guqin\u2019s strings. \nBefore, it was just closed-mouth kisses, but now Lan Wangji is licking lightly against his skin, his breath like a cool burst of air, his motions so even and controlled.\nWei Wuxian lets his head fall back, his arms stretched above his head and his spine curling as he raises his hips. If it\u2019s shameful, so be it. \nWhen was he last so aware of his body? For months, it\u2019s been a constant struggle to drown out the voices in his head, to keep his mind in the present. But now, this moment is stretching into eternity, and all he has to be aware of is himself, and Lan Wangji touching him. When did he last feel so good?\n\u201cAh, ah\u2014\u201d The noises slip unbidden from his lips, and his entire body tensing and relaxing at intervals, rolling into the rhythm of Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth on him.\nLan Wangji hums around him, taking him into his mouth, and fuck, even that is melodic. He isn\u2019t swallowing him down entirely, just licking over his tip and then a bit deeper, but it\u2019s still so good that Wei Wuxian never wants it to end.\nHow must Lan Wangji look, right now? Is his hair still perfectly in place, or have dark strands come loose over his white robes? Are his lips stretched painfully, made red by the attention they\u2019ve given Wei Wuxian?\nThe image of Lan Wangji\u2014 perfect in white and blue, but with his lips red and wet\u2014 sends Wei Wuxian jolting up against the dais. His open robe slips from his shoulders, and he gasps for air. \n\u201cLan Zhan\u2014 Lan Zhan\u2014\u201d\nLan Wangji only hums again, then continues to lick at his cock even as Wei Wuxian begins to come. \nHe can\u2019t control it, can\u2019t see it, only feels that Lan Wangji pulls off of him, feels his come spilling over his thighs. His breathing is ragged, his vision white even behind the length of black silk. \n\u201cWei Ying.\u201d Lan Wangji is beside him, again, brushing a cool cloth over his forehead and cheeks. \n\u201cSecond Master Lan is so diligent,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, when his words finally return to him. Still, he leans into the touch of the cloth, strains to feel Lan Wangji\u2019s fingertips through it.\nLan Wangji hums neutrally, and Wei Wuxian thinks that perhaps the blindfold is a kindness. He doesn\u2019t have to see whatever expression is on Lan Wangji\u2019s face, and search for meaning there. Because he\u2019s said this is his choice, but what does that really mean? That of all the options, Lan Wangji chose to take on this burden himself? Is he so righteous, so noble, that he\u2019d sacrifice this intimacy, meant for another, to save Wei Wuxian?\nHe doesn\u2019t want to look at Lan Wangji right now and see only duty and resignation on his face. And he knows that isn\u2019t fair to Lan Wangji, not when Wei Wuxian proposed this entire thing out of a sense of duty, out of a desperation to spare the Wen clan and alleviate the burdens of Lotus Pier. This is his only chance to remain in the cultivation world without giving up cultivation entirely, without revealing what he\u2019s lost. \nBut how can he do this to Lan Wangji? \n\u201cWhat will Gusu Lan think?\u201d \n\u201cMn?\u201d Lan Wangji questions, his hands stilling in their rhythmic motions.\nDid he say that aloud? What is wrong with him? \n\u201cGusu Lan did not bid me to come here,\u201d Lan Wangji says slowly, answering the question that Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t dare repeat.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t try to stop you?\u201d Wei Wuxian has to know. \n\u201cMy sect does not dictate my choices,\u201d Lan Wangji says carefully, with surety. \n\u201cYou go to sleep at nine and wake at five!\u201d Wei Wuxian yells, hysterical. \u201cEvery day, without fail!\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s hand rests lightly on his shoulder, now bare. It\u2019s too much, but Wei Wuxian also never wants it to stop. \n\u201cBecause I choose to,\u201d Lan Wangji says simply. \nHe doesn\u2019t understand Lan Wangji. He wishes he didn\u2019t understand himself so well, and what he\u2019s selfishly feeling in this moment.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji breathes out, either relieved or frustrated. \nWei Wuxian closes his eyes behind the black silk, lets his head fall back. \u201cI won\u2019t stop you,\u201d he says.\n\u2014 \nLan Wangji has many admirable qualities. Those days they\u2019d spent together in Gusu Lan\u2019s library pavilion, Wei Wuxian had learned about Lan Wangji\u2019s virtues, and how different the two of them truly are. Case in point? Lan Wangji has endless reserves of patience, his fortitude deep and inexhaustible. Wei Wuxian, on the other hand, is mercurial and easily bored, always ready to be blown in a new direction by the wind. \nWei Wuxian\u2019s body is relaxed from that first orgasm, his muscles uncoiled and loose for the first time in ages. But his mind is as active as ever, running in different directions when he hears Lan Wangji unscrewing the cap of a lacquered wood container. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asks, suspicious.\nThe scent that fills the air is like rose water, light on the senses but unmistakable. The Wen women who live in Yiling have no use for perfumes, and Jiang Yanli has always favored creams scented with lotuses, and now peonies. Rose water is something new, not associated with any specific person. \n\u201cTo ease the way,\u201d Lan Wangji says.\n\u201cOh?\u201d Wei Wuxian can\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit vulgar, isn\u2019t it, Lan Zhan? Did you research this? How are you so well-prepared\u2014 oh!\u201d \nHe can\u2019t help but yelp, when Lan Wangji brushes up his legs, and then circles his rim with cool fingers coated in smooth oil. \nWei Wuxian is no stranger to these things, in theory. He\u2019s looked at all sorts of illicit materials, mostly supplied by Nie Huaisang. He\u2019s even seen cut-sleeve works, is familiar with men sitting atop one another\u2019s laps, or taking each other in hand or mouth. But despite all that theoretical, almost voyeuristic knowledge, there is still something startling about Lan Wangji reaching inside of him.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, voice like water gentling flowing over stone. \u201cRelax.\u201d\nWei Wuxian wonders if Lan Wangji would be able to relax, if Wei Wuxian reached inside of him and stretched him open. That\u2019s another scenario he shouldn\u2019t dare imagine, and yet\u2014\nLan Wangji presses one finger inside of him, holding it shallowly inside of Wei Wuxian\u2019s heat, waiting for the tension in his muscles to ease. Wei Wuxian knows exactly what Lan Wangji\u2019s hands look like, his long and elegant figures skipping across a guqin\u2019s string, his grip white-knuckled on Bichen\u2019s hilt in battle. His hands are beautiful and skilled, and right now he is using them to ease his way inside of Wei Wuxian. \n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says on an exhale, his chuckle lost in his deep sigh of relief, of fondness. \nLan Wangji hums, and presses deeper inside of him. The intrusion is uncomfortable, unnatural. But Lan Wangji is patient, his touches soft but sure. He works his way around the inside of Wei Wuxian\u2019s rim, pressing against the soft heat of him. Wei Wuxian breathes in and out with the motions, inhaling with each moment of pressure and exhaling when it releases. \n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji hums approvingly. His other hand brushes soothingly up and down Wei Wuxian\u2019s side, from under his ribs to the jut of his hip. \nThe only problem with Lan Wangji, Wei Wuxian thinks in between breaths, is that he isn\u2019t much for talking. There\u2019s nothing for Wei Wuxian to focus on or be distracted by, and so all he can do is imagine the press of beautiful, elegant fingers inside of him.\n\u201cI wish I could see you,\u201d he murmurs carelessly. It\u2019s been awhile, since he\u2019s seen Lan Wangji in person. \u201cI\u2019m always stealing looks at you, but now, when you\u2019re right here for me to look at, I can\u2019t see you.\u201d\nNormally, he\u2019d keep a tighter rein on his tongue. Or perhaps he wouldn\u2019t, but the words would be meant to tease Lan Wangji and get a rise out of him. Now, his words are painfully honest.\n\u201cYou,\u201d Lan Wangji begins, his fingers stilling inside Wei Wuxian.\n\u201cPeople say that to you a lot, don\u2019t they?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. \u201cYou, the most beautiful Young Master. It\u2019s the truth. I just want to know\u2014 what do you look like\u2014 when you\u2019re doing such things to me?\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s efforts inside of him do not cease. Even with Wei Wuxian saying such things, he\u2019s focused on the task at hand. He\u2019s silent, in the face of Wei Wuxian\u2019s words.\n\u201cThis is why I need to see you!\u201d Wei Wuxian complains. \u201cI can\u2019t tell what you\u2019re thinking, when I can\u2019t see your face! Are you blushing, Lan Zhan? Or do people say this to you so much that it doesn\u2019t matter, at all?\u201d\nMaybe it\u2019s the orgasm making him loose, or the strange security that being with Lan Wangji gives him. For the first time in months, or longer, he isn\u2019t looking over his shoulder for an immediate threat. Despite the sometimes-painful clench of his muscles against intrusion, he\u2019s more relaxed than he can remember being. Lan Wangji\u2019s touch is soothing, and it feels so good.\nBut then, it\u2019s gone.\n\u201cLan Zhan?\u201d Wei Wuxian tries to lift himself up, but cool hands\u2014 one slick\u2014 come up against his wrists where they\u2019re bound above him. \nLan Wangji yanks at the restraints, releasing one entirely. He pulls Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand forward, pressing it against his own cheek.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, dumbfounded. \u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019re warm.\u201d\nWei Wuxian can\u2019t see him, but he can feel him. His cheeks are flushed, and they must be red. How does the soft blush look against Lan Wangji\u2019s porcelain skin? White has always been Lan Wangji\u2019s color, and red Wei Wuxian\u2019s. Is Wei Wuxian leaving his mark, painting Lan Wangji\u2019s skin in his own way?\nLan Wangji leaves Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand pressed against his face for three heartbeats, then pulls it away and reties it above Wei Wuxian\u2019s head. \n\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, disappointed this time. \u201cBut Lan Zhan, I want to touch you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe ritual has rules,\u201d Lan Wangji says.\n\u201cWhatever happened to choosing?\u201d Wei Wuxian teases.\nFingers brush over his bound wrists, then lightly over his lips. \u201cI chose.\u201d\nThe implication sends a jolt through Wei Wuxian. Lan Wangji likes having him trussed up like this? It probably makes him easier to deal with, but the tone of Lan Wangji\u2019s voice suggested something else. There was a darkness to it, like the sharpest edge of good alcohol.\n\u201cYou like this,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, half a question. \u201cLan Zhan\u2014 Lan Er Ge, do you like having me at your mercy?\u201d\n\u201cShameless,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs.\n\u201cWhich one of us has the other tied up and naked, hm? Am I the only shameless one?\u201d\nOnly silence answers him, and Wei Wuxian strains to hear what else is happening. The brush of fabric, soft footsteps around the dais. A hand brushes lightly over his half-hard cock, making Wei Wuxian gasp for breath.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he whines. \u201cNo warning?\u201d\nWarmth presses against him, all along one side. An arm is draped across his waist, and the drape of long hair tickles his cheek and neck. \nRealizing what must now be true, Wei Wuxian\u2019s mind can\u2019t even comprehend the image that would be his to behold if only his eyes weren\u2019t covered.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers, \u201cAre you naked, beside me?\u201d\nThe arm around his waist tightens, but Lan Wangji does not answer.\n\u201cAre you embarrassed?\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be. I\u2019ve seen you naked before, after all, and there is nothing for you to be\u2014\u201d\nWei Wuxian cuts himself off, suddenly embarrassed himself. His own body is littered with scars, strikes from a whip and from an operation, branded by the Wen\u2019s seal. He\u2019s never quite regained the weight he lost in the Burial Mounds. When he\u2019d emerged, he was thin and gaunt, his eyes haunted and shadowed. He hasn\u2019t eaten properly in months, spending his time meditating and trying to keep a hold on the resentful energy that is now his only weapon. \nWhat does Lan Wangji see, when he gazes at Wei Wuxian\u2019s body? Is it enticing, or pitiful?\nWei Wuxian turns as much as he can, pressing his face into Lan Wangji\u2019s neck and breathing in the clear scent of sandalwood. He shakes his head, trying to rid it of useless thoughts. \n\u201cLan Zhan should get something out of this, too,\u201d he says, pressing as close as he can. His movements are mostly restricted, but when he shifts his legs his thigh presses against Lan Wangji, hard and wanting.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, half censure and half curse.\nWei Wuxian can\u2019t help but smile. \u201cThat will make things easier, won\u2019t it? When I first suggested this, I imagined a maiden would have to use tools to complete the ritual. The old scrolls I found, they were mostly about women cultivators who\u2019d gone down the wrong path. I wonder if that was true, or if it was just a way to force those women to marry into gentry clans. What do you think, Lan Zhan?\u201d\nThe ancient rite had described cleansing the body of resentful energy by way of a type of dual cultivation. By joining with a righteous cultivator, and having their spiritual energy enter you along with joining with them physically, one could be cleansed of resentful energy.\nWei Wuxian doesn\u2019t actually expect that to work. He doubts that any of those rogue cultivators had lost their golden cores, their very ability to call on spiritual power. He doesn\u2019t want to give up this new path he\u2019s walking. But he wants to be a part of his family\u2019s lives, and it would be wonderful to not be so damn lonely, all of the time.\nThe idea of joining with Lan Wangji so intimately is enticing in a way that has nothing to do with the ritual. Has he always been drawn in by Lan Wangji this way, since the beginning? It feels like it. Even knowing he annoyed Lan Wangji, or imagining that Lan Wangji hated him, Wei Wuxian still wanted to be closer. \n\u201cI really am selfish,\u201d he mumbles, pressing into the comforting heat and surety of Lan Wangji\u2019s body. \nGentle hands run down his sides, coming to rest against his hips. \u201cWei Ying is\u2026 strong. Selfless.\u201d\nWei Wuxian chokes on a laugh, shaking his head. He tries to help everyone he can, but where has that gotten him? Has his playing the hero actually helped anyone? Or has it just continually put targets on those he loves most?\n\u201cHow will the cultivation world ever forgive you for this,\u201d Wei Wuxian wonders.\nWei Wuxian feels Lan Wangji\u2019s sigh in the breath against his face. Then, hands are clenched over his own where they\u2019re held above his head. Lips are pressing against his, insistent and sure.\nWei Wuxian sighs into the kiss, opens his lips and lets Lan Wangji brush his tongue across his teeth, over the roof of his mouth. He can feel the weight of Lan Wangji\u2019s body pressing down on him, his hardness apparent, his skin flushed, his breathing shallow. \nHe doesn\u2019t know whether he\u2019d prefer to have all of Lan Wangji\u2019s strength and conviction unleashed on him, or whether he\u2019d want Lan Wangji trussed up like he himself is now, laid out at Wei Wuxian\u2019s mercy. Both thoughts send jolts of electricity through him, have him tilting his head upwards and moaning into Lan Wangji\u2019s kisses.\nIt\u2019s just as intense, as incredible, as that first kiss was on Phoenix Mountain. Or perhaps it\u2019s better, because now he knows who it is who\u2019s holding him so tightly, who\u2019s panting against his mouth and pressing closer to him until their legs are tangled. \nLan Wangji was his first everything, wasn\u2019t he? His first kiss, unknown, but also the first person to catch his eye and never let him go. The only person who\u2019d dare challenge him openly since he became the Yiling Patriarch, but in a way that speaks of concern rather than condemnation and fear. \n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and no matter how many times Wei Wuxian hears it the sound of his name on Lan Wangji\u2019s tongue will always be something special, something sacred. \u201cYou\u2019re ready?\u201d\nLan Wangji had taken his time preparing him, and Wei Wuxian is loose and open and wanting. He nods against the crook of Lan Wangji\u2019s neck, then mumbles, \u201cYes, Lan Zhan. I\u2019m ready.\u201d\nLan Wangji releases his hands to guide himself inside of Wei Wuxian. Despite everything, Wei Wuxian holds his breath in anticipation, the muscles of his legs tightening just before the intrusion breaches him. \n\u201cBreathe, Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs gentle, running a hand down the curve of his spine. \nThe pressure, the presence, of Lan Wangji inside of him is overwhelming. He can\u2019t think, can\u2019t focus, can only feel Lan Wangji\u2019s hardness filling up the space inside of him, impossible to ignore. Wei Wuxian breathes raggedly through his teeth, his bound hands scrambling to grasp at nothing.\n\u201cAh\u2014 ah\u2014 ah\u2014\u201d \nLan Wangji continues to stroke up and down his back, to kiss him, to bite down lightly on his tongue. Somehow that helps, the moment\u2019s spark of pain centering his thoughts and allowing him to relax enough to adjust around Lan Wangji\u2019s considerable length.\nNothing is within his control. He can\u2019t see, can barely move, can do nothing but feel.\nBut strong arms hold him tight, and he knows with surety that they will see him through this. He\u2019s safe, no matter what.\n\u201cLan Zhan, Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan,\u201d he babbles, fingers curling. He wishes he could hold onto Lan Wangji in return.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Lan Wangji asks, voice close against his ear.\nWei Wuxian nods. \u201cKeep\u2014 keep going.\u201d\nLan Wangji nods, and Wei Wuxian can feel the brush of hair against his cheeks. \nThe first thrust inside of him is impossible to explain. His sensation spirals out in all directions as his mind tries to understand the feel of something\u2014 someone\u2014 moving inside of him. All he can do is let his head fall back and breathe through it. \nLan Wangji begins moving in earnest, and it\u2019s strange but not entirely unpleasant once Wei Wuxian grows accustomed to it. Like sitting in a boat on Yunmeng\u2019s lakes and letting the currents push him to and fro, he wills himself to move in time with Lan Wangji\u2019s motions. Lan Wangji presses his hands against Wei Wuxian\u2019s hips, and Wei Wuxian feels them press into him like a brand. He wonders if Lan Wangji is strong enough to bruise him unintentionally. He hopes that he is.\nThe rhythm is almost musical, but every time it begins to steady Lan Wangji lets out a ragged breath and pushes in deeper, harder. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cI cannot hold back.\u201d\nWei Wuxian thinks he might shatter entirely if Lan Wangji stops, so he just nods. \u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t,\u201d he encourages. \u201cKeep moving, Lan Zhan.\u201d\nLan Wangji breathes out a sigh of relief, and then he\u2019s moving so powerfully that Wei Wuxian is half raised off the dais. From this angle, he can wrap his legs around Lan Wangji\u2019s waist, and that allows him to hold onto him somehow as Lan Wangji pounds into him. \n\u201cHow does it feel, for you,\u201d Wei Wuxian babbles. \u201cYou\u2019re so big, Lan Zhan, I never imagined\u2014 it feels strange, but good\u2014\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s movements are no longer so controlled, one large thrust followed by a series of shallow ones, keeping Wei Wuxian from predicting anything. He clenches around Lan Wangji, and then Lan Wangji lifts his hips up and\u2014\n\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian cries out, stunned. \u201cOh, oh. Whatever that was\u2014 again. Lan Zhan, again.\u201d\nLan Wangji barely needs the encouragement. He proceeds to press into that spot with all the force he can muster, until Wei Wuxian is practically sobbing out his name. \nWei Wuxian is climbing higher and higher, his arousal pulling him up to the sky, the clouds. He floats in that space, cool air around him and Lan Wangji hot inside of him, and he knows that the instant he comes back to himself he will plummet downwards again. \nHow many times has he fallen, in his life? Will this be any different?\nYes, a small voice inside of him insists. It will be different, because there\u2019s someone holding on to him. There will be someone to catch him when he falls. \nHe laughs out breathily, tears in the corners of his eyes, dripping down past the blindfold. Lan Zhan will catch him, won\u2019t he? It doesn\u2019t matter that he can\u2019t think, that all he can do is feel lightning rushing through his veins and his body heating up like it\u2019s being warmed over burning coals. It doesn\u2019t matter, it doesn\u2019t matter, because even if he shatters Lan Wangji will diligently collect all of his pieces. \n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying cries out. \u201cI love you, Lan Zhan. Thank you.\u201d\nHe\u2019s surrounded by an incredible, clear warmth. He wonders if that\u2019s Lan Wangji\u2019s spiritual energy, suffusing him from the inside out. Then he can\u2019t think at all, because Lan Wangji is letting out a ragged moan that goes straight to his cock. Wei Wuxian sucks in a breath and clenches down, and then Lan Wangji is coming inside of him. Spiritual energy pours into him, along with the warm wetness of Lan Wangji\u2019s release.\nIt isn\u2019t fair, not at all. He didn\u2019t even get to see Lan Wangji\u2019s face when he came! \nImagining it is something, though. And Lan Wangji is still moving inside of him, and Wei Wuxian is rocking into the motion, and Lan Wangji is reaching up to clasp Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands. \n\u201cOh, oh,\u201d Wei Wuxian moans out, hips rising to rub up against Lan Wangji, giving him just the extra bit of friction he needs. He presses up against Lan Wangji as he comes, his head spinning and Lan Wangji clasping his hands so tightly it\u2019s as though he\u2019ll never let go.\n\u201cDon\u2019t let me go,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, his voice gurgling like ripples through water. He lets his head fall back, and sensation claims him entirely.\n\u2014\nHe comes back to himself slowly, the whiteness of the room overwhelming him. It\u2019s only when he realizes that he can see again that he jolts up to a seated position and immediately regrets it. But it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine, he needs to see\u2014\n\u201cWei Ying.\u201d Lan Zhan stands to one side of the dais, his inner white robe bound carelessly at his waist, a soft white cloth in his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he says, brows furrowing with disapproval.\nWei Wuxian nods dumbly and lowers himself back down. It\u2019s fine, because he can still see Lan Wangji from this angle. He\u2019s beautiful, his pale skin still flushed with color, his hair disheveled and his forehead ribbon missing. \nLan Wangji rubs the cloth over Wei Wuxian\u2019s stomach, between his thighs. It\u2019s a little humiliating, to be so thoroughly taken care of, but it also feels good, and safe. Nevertheless, he squirms when Lan Wangji cleans between his legs, and then inside of his hole.\n\u201cLan Zhan, you don\u2019t need to\u2014\u201d\nLan Wangji silences him with a look. He lifts his chin and says, \u201cMy duty.\u201d\nThe satisfied smile that\u2019s been playing on Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips immediately falls away. Ah, of course. All of this was about duty, wasn\u2019t it? And whatever Wei Wuxian had imagined in the throes of it, whatever he had said\u2014\nOh. Oh no. He\u2019d said such a thing, to Lan Wangji, and now Lan Wangji is likely mortifyingly embarrassed on his behalf. \nOf course, he tries to laugh it off. \u201cSo diligent,\u201d he comments, ruefully. His eyes feel hot.\nLan Wangji reaches up, unties Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrists and massages the skin there gently. \u201cYou pulled too hard,\u201d he comments. \n\u201cSorry,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, in a small voice. That doesn\u2019t quite make sense, because Lan Wangji is likely only worried for him. \u201cSorry, Lan Zhan. You\u2019ve done so much for me, and now I\u2019ve put you in this position\u2014\u201d\nLan Wangji looks down on him, his eyebrows delicately arched. \u201cPosition?\u201d\nWei Wuxian laughs, and it turns into a sob. He really is completely undone by orgasm, isn\u2019t he? It\u2019s a good thing he never intends to have sex again, if it isn\u2019t with Lan Wangji. And since there are no more rituals to complete, that just means he\u2019ll never\u2014\nStrong hands land on his shoulders, shaking him. \u201cWei Ying.\u201d\nWei Wuxian forces a smile, looks up. \u201cLan Zhan.\u201d\nLan Wangji lets out a little sigh of frustration, like he can\u2019t stand what he\u2019s read on Wei Wuxian\u2019s face. \u201cOnly one,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wei Wuxian questions.\n\u201cDisciples of Gusu Lan,\u201d Lan Wangji explains, \u201cOnly have one partner. For life.\u201d\nWei Wuxian swallows, unsure of whether he\u2019s about to laugh or cry. \u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cA rule I choose to follow,\u201d Lan Wangji continues. \u201cWei Ying, I chose you.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, though his mind won\u2019t quite believe it. Lan Wangji wants him, as his only partner, for life? How could he? \nLan Wangji shakes his head. \u201cOn Phoenix Mountain. I kissed you.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you wanted to bed me?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks dumbly.\nLan Wangji shakes his head, leans down and presses a firm kiss to Wei Wuxian\u2019s brow. \u201cBecause I love you, Wei Ying.\u201d\nHe bursts into laughter, but it\u2019s happy and not at all mocking. \u201cYou do?\u201d\nLan Wangji cups Wei Wuxian\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cI told you, I chose you.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan really is beautiful,\u201d Wei Wuxian babbles, pressing forward to lean against Lan Wangji\u2019s chest, only a single layer of clothing between them. \u201cI love you.\u201d\nThere are so many things he has to tell Lan Wangji, things that he might have already guessed. The ritual had been one of spiritual power, and surely Lan Wangji had recognized that Wei Wuxian couldn\u2019t take any into his body, has no golden core to hold onto it. \nBut Lan Wangji is sure, and steady. If Wei Wuxian explains, if he lets himself fall into Lan Wangji\u2019s arms, won\u2019t he catch him? Won\u2019t he be there for Wei Wuxian to rely upon?\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Wei Wuxian says again, face pressed against Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. \u201cI had to do this, to keep them safe, but\u2014 but I can\u2019t imagine it being anyone but you, Lan Zhan.\u201d\n\u201cI could not let anyone else\u2026\u201d Lan Wangji trails off, cheeks red. He rests a hand against the crown of Wei Wuxian\u2019s head. \u201cThen I will keep you safe, Wei Ying.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a promise Wei Wuxian can believe. He presses into Lan Wangji\u2019s hold, wraps his arms around the surest thing in his life. If Lan Wangji is beside him, he can take on the entire cultivation world again. Or, even more fraught, he can try and fit himself back into the world he wants to be a part of. \n\u201cNext time,\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs, \u201cI want to see your face when you come.\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s grip on him tightens, and Wei Wuxian can feel his smile when says, \u201cShameless.\u201d"
