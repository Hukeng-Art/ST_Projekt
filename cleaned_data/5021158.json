    "notes": "<p>Okay so this is my first technical Drarry. The Wolfstar tag is a background ship but they're in it enough to count for the tags. I'm extremely uneasy about my characterisations about this, but hopefully I haven't done it too terribly. If so, feel free to let me know in comments. I got this idea after a chat with some friends about how interesting it might have been if Draco's son had been a squib. Someone mentioned poetic justice and I thought, what a terrible thing to pin on a child, but how many of the characters would have thought that, you know? Anyway it's not as in-depth as I wanted but hopefully it works. xx</p>",
    "text": "He was sat at his desk with a cup of tea he\u2019d over-boiled and already burnt his mouth on. His glasses were smudged, but he couldn\u2019t be arsed to clean them off. He was exhausted and the year hadn\u2019t even got started yet. \nHarry Potter was thirty-two years old, and he hadn\u2019t referred to himself as Wizard, or the Boy Who Lived, or any of it for the last fifteen. In fact, he hadn\u2019t even been known as Harry Potter for ten of those fifteen. The first five he\u2019d been Harry James Potter, a University Student after charming\u2014literally\u2014his way into King\u2019s College and deciding at some point he would become a teacher.\nSo he had. He\u2019d shut off all connections to the wizarding world, he\u2019d packed his things, found a nice flat being let, converted what was left of his gold into quid, and just sort of\u2026started over.\nSeemed the thing to do, really, because everyone expected him to just be okay. To just cast a series of cheering charms on himself, maybe a little obliviate, and get over it. Maybe marry Ginny. Be some fucked-up do-over of his dead parents and have a bunch of children and ignore the fact that he was responsible for a load of deaths and whether or not Voldemort had been a monster\u2014he was still dead and dead by Harry\u2019s wand.\nWhich was in a box on his mantle.\nThe only thing magical in his house was a small pot of floo powder\u2014his godfathers used it to travel from time to time and it was really unfair to ask Sirius or Remus to brave the tube. And that was it. And they never called uninvited.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t miss his friends, or love them, or wonder how they were getting on with careers and kids and everything, but he couldn\u2019t do it. He just couldn\u2019t do it, and what was worse was everyone expected him to be able to.\nLike he could walk off the battlefield of the shattered Hogwarts and be like, \u201cWell lads, looks like we\u2019ve done it. Finally taken care of that big bad once and for all. Let\u2019s all go have a bath and tomorrow we can begin again.\u201d\nHe had to wonder if Dumbledore knew it would be like that. Impossible to live through. There had been more than once he regretted choosing to come back.\nBut now he was working for a muggle school teaching year sevens literature and whilst it wasn\u2019t the grandest career he could have got into, it was different and wonderful. He could sit at his desk and not wonder all the time what was going on behind charms and wards. He didn\u2019t know anything. He didn\u2019t know who had got married and who had gone back to Hogwarts and who had done anything at all ever.\nIt was how he wanted it.\nHe sipped his tea again and grimaced at the ache on the tip of his tongue. His tea was too bitter, but it was caffeinated and that was the important part. He was staring down at his class list presently, going through the names, working through the subjects he wanted to bring up.\nHarry hadn\u2019t got a chance to properly love books. As a kid the Dursleys rarely had any for him to read\u2014and god forbid he ever ask for any. And at Hogwarts they sort of let traditional education fall by the wayside in favour of studying all things magic which left Harry at a serious disadvantage when he decided to leave.\nBut catching up had been easy enough, and Harry discovered his love of writing. Of reading. Of all of it. Of fantasy and being able to just pretend sometimes that none of it was ever real.\nBehind his smudged glasses, his eyes scanned the list.\nThe particular school he was working had was only open going on their third year. It was set up as an alternative to traditional secondary. They stuck to the traditional curriculum but did so with emphasis on the arts and literature. And kept it free for those who couldn\u2019t afford it.\nHarry\u2019d seen enough pandering to the wealthy and aristocratic blooded for at least a dozen lifetimes. He wanted to give something to those kids who didn\u2019t have to scrape together what little they had just to feel special.\nMalloy, Benjamin. Malfoy, Scorpius.\nHarry\u2019s breath caught in his throat and he looked at the name again because no. No. No.\nThis was a muggle school full of muggles and so far from the sodding wizarding world and there was no way a blasted Malfoy was on his list. Scorpius. Scorpius Malfoy.\nHad to be some distant squib cousin or something.\nScorpius though.\nHarry was near shaking by the time he stood up from the desk and grabbed his keys. He locked up the office in a daze and made his way to the car park. He drove a small car, something he learnt to do before he did anything else. Sirius had offered his motorbike which had all the flying charms removed, but Harry didn\u2019t want something that reminded him of a broom.\nHe took the corners a little too fast and it seemed his body knew what to do before his mind caught up to himself.\nHe was in the flat before he realised it and his hand was reaching for that long box on the mantle. The wand felt foreign beneath his fingers, like the quick taste of hard drugs to an addict, it tingled up his arm. His lips curved round an incantation he hadn\u2019t used in years, connecting his fire to the floo network.\nIt glowed green, roaring, then settled back into a gentle, orange warmth. His fingers pinched out just a bit of the floo powder and he was speaking the name of his godfather to make the call.\nHis head reached into the flames right when his mind properly caught up with itself, and he gasped when the back wall of his fireplace turned into the lounge to Remus and Sirius\u2019 flat. The pair of them were on the sofa. Sirius was stretched out, one arm flung over his eyes, the other dangling toward the floor. His chest rose and fell with rhythmic motions. His hair was fanned out on Remus\u2019 thigh where his head rested, and Remus was carding one hand through the inky locks, the other holding a book.\nThe tawny-haired werewolf was looking no worse for the wear, which was good considering all things. He did look surprised, and half-delighted to see Harry\u2019s head floating there in the flames though.\n\u201cMerlin. Seems we have a visitor.\u201d Remus prodded Sirius. \u201cWake up, you lazy slag. We\u2019ve got company. You want to come through?\u201d\nHarry gulped, not trusting himself to speak. Instead he pulled back, got more powder, and went through the flames until he stepped gracefully out of the hearth. At least he\u2019d learnt to do that properly enough before he told the whole of the wizarding world to sod off.\n\u201cSirius,\u201d Remus prodded again.\n\u201cFuck off, Moony. M\u2019sleeping. I need my beauty rest at this age.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve a visitor,\u201d Remus hissed, giving Harry an apologetic grin. \u201cSorry, he\u2019s impossible before he\u2019s had his proper nap.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Harry said. \n\u201cGet up you useless waste of space. Sodding mutt,\u201d Remus gave Sirius a shove and he tumbled onto the floor, all lanky limbs flailing about.\nSirius growled. \u201cI\u2019m going to bloody hex the\u2026\u201d He stopped when he saw Harry and his face burst into a sunbeam of smiles. \u201cOh my god, Moony you dirty beast! Why didn\u2019t you tell me it was Harry?\u201d\n\u201cWas trying,\u201d Remus said, hiding his smile behind his hand.\nHarry wanted to say hello, but instead he was engulfed in an embrace by his shorter godfather who, in spite of the height difference, was still imposing as ever. His strong arms held him fast. \u201cWhat are you doing here? You\u2019re using the floo?\u201d\nHarry shrugged, trying to still be uncomfortable but it was hard in the presence of these two men who loved him dearly. \u201cWell, I er\u2026had a question. Important one.\u201d\nRemus beckoned him over and Harry let himself be sat between them. \u201cCan we get you anything? Tea?\u201d\n\u201cFine for now,\u201d Harry said. He rubbed his face, remembered he had his glasses on, and took them off to rub them on his shirt. \u201cCan you tell me what you know about Draco Malfoy? What he\u2019s up to now, I mean.\u201d\nSirius gave a groan. \u201cMerlin you\u2019re worse than me and Snivellus.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said, his voice rushed and tight. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026\u201d He stopped and heaved a breath. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s the start of term and I was going through my updated student list and there was a name on there. Scorpius Malfoy. Hardly a muggle name, is it? Scorpius. I mean, even with the weird trends these days.\u201d\nHe watched his godfathers give each other a look and he just knew. \u201cIt\u2026could be,\u201d Remus said slowly. \u201cAfter Lucius passed, no one saw much of Draco. He\u2019s got a job at the ministry, not sure what it is. But he left the manor and no one\u2019s heard from him.\u201d\n\u201cIs he married?\u201d\nSirius shrugged, leaning back. \u201cCousin or not, I try not to keep tabs. Could well be though.\u201d\nHarry huffed and worried his bottom lip between his teeth. \u201cD\u2019you think it could be some other distant relative?\u201d\n\u201cAlso could be,\u201d Sirius replied. \u201cYou\u2019re really so worried?\u201d\nHarry leant back against the cushions and tried not to feel the suffocating anxiety of being in a magical house with two grown wizards who used magic like it was nothing. \u201cWhen you spent more than half your life trying to escape it,\u201d he finally said, \u201cit\u2019s not exactly thrilling to find a name like Malfoy on your student list.\u201d\n\u201cWell he\u2019d hardly know it was you, right?\u201d Remus pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019re not using Potter.\u201d\n\u201cIf the boy\u2019s magical\u2014which it\u2019s secondary so he should be at Hogwarts if he is\u2014then he would. Or even if he\u2019s a squib he\u2019s bound to recognise me from somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re letting it get to you. Which is what can happen when you don\u2019t face your fears,\u201d Remus cautioned.\nHarry had heard the lecture many times and was apathetic toward it now, instead of irritated. \u201cI know. But I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\nHis godfathers gave him a look of pity which he hated, but arms came round his shoulders and those were full of love and support and it warmed him. \u201cJust\u2026proceed with caution. If it seems dodgy, floo us, or send a letter or something.\u201d Remus squeezed his knee. \u201cYou can obviously reach us, and we can step in.\u201d\nHarry nodded, feeling comforted.\n\u201cCome on. Have tea,\u201d Remus prodded, and rose to fetch it.\nAlone with Sirius, Harry pulled away slightly. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d\nSirius gave Harry a cautious smile. \u201cWell as can be expected in my advance age.\u201d\n\u201cFifty four,\u201d Harry said with a snort. \u201cYou can say it when you grow out of your dramatics.\u201d\nSirius barked a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019ll be never, then. I suppose I can live with it.\u201d He stretched his arm out along the top of the sofa. \u201cAnd you, Mr Evans.\u201d\nHarry winced, knowing it likely hurt his godfather every time he thought about it, but he wouldn\u2019t be sorry for it. He couldn\u2019t be. \u201cI\u2019ve been worse. Not sure I\u2019ve ever been better.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s something.\u201d Sirius looked at Harry for a long moment. \u201cNo one\u2019s angry with you, you know.\u201d\nHarry let out a breath. \u201cYou know how hard it is. I mean, you of all people. Twelve years you were tormented by the Dementors. Twelve years and then you came out to war and loss and tragedy. But you stayed. So what does that make me?\u201d\n\u201cSmart.\u201d Remus came in carrying three mugs of tea made the muggle way, or close enough to it. The bags were still in, bits of cream in each. He handed them out, and sat down. \u201cSmarter than Sirius, at least.\u201d\n\u201cHis marks never beat mine,\u201d Sirius defended.\n\u201cYour natural genius only extended so far, Padfoot.\u201d Remus winked at his long-time lover. \u201cThe thing of it is, Harry, you can only escape the magical world when you\u2019ve really chosen sides. When you\u2019ve forgiven yourself for everything, when you\u2019ve decided. Right now you\u2019re still in limbo and it doesn\u2019t matter how we feel. Won\u2019t matter until you\u2019ve let it go.\u201d\nHarry swallowed a mouthful of tea and had a painful memory of his one single, solitary summer of peace. Just after the final battle, curled up every night in the second bedroom in Lupin\u2019s house. It was just the three of them, then. No magic, no owls, no reporters or aurors or anything. Just a small family and it was a taste of what Harry might\u2019ve had if different decisions had been made.\nHarry knew the nightmares lurked just round the corner, waiting for him to let go. But he wanted to give himself that. He wanted to let himself have tea and home-cooked meals and warm embraces. Remus and Sirius had, in spite of their failings, loved him without conditions. Still did. No matter how much his distance and silence hurt them over the years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier said than done,\u201d Harry said after a moment.\nSirius barked another laugh and pulled his godson in close. \u201cThose, Harry, are the truest words you\u2019ve ever spoken.\u201d\n*** \nIn the end, he went back to his flat and closed down the floo, but made a promise to Sirius and Remus they could owl now. Small steps. He would always be part of the wizarding world, those he loved were still in it. So he\u2019d give them that comfort.\nHe had no time to dwell on it. If he did, he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep his composure the next morning when he found out just how close to Draco Malfoy this boy was.\nHe was stiff in his chair when the students began to file in. All pressed in their uniforms and bright eyes and curiosity. These eleven year olds were setting foot into the education which would guide them into adulthood and it was Harry\u2019s job to make it as painless as possible.\nHe kept his eyes fixed, almost lazy and unfocused as they all walked in. He recognised a few from their resemblances to older siblings.\nAnd then he walked in.\nHarry thought for a moment, \u2018I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t.\u2019\nThere was no mistaking this boy for the son of Draco Malfoy. Harry was instantly ripped back twenty-three years to a small boy in a robe shop talking to him about Hogwarts Houses. And a small boy blushing furiously as Harry scoffed at his offered hand.\nHe wasn\u2019t Draco, of course. He was softer in features, his hair combed and styled in a shaggy, popular fashion all the boys were wearing. He had a pink to his cheeks, like he hadn\u2019t been kept locked away in a manor most of his life. He\u2019d seen the sun. He\u2019d played. He wasn\u2019t laden heavy with the burden of a Death Eater legacy.\nOr at least, that\u2019s what Harry assumed.\nHe took a breath when they were all seated, and rose.\n\u201cGood afternoon, my name is Mr Evans and I will be handling your literature modules this term. As I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been explained to you in your other classes, we do things a little differently here.\u201d He droned into his welcoming speech, trying to disarm the children a little, raise their comfort levels. Let them know the education was there for them, not to discourage or weigh them down.\nHe watched them all, but mostly the small Malfoy who as yet didn\u2019t seem to notice the extra attention. If Harry was very good at his job, maybe he wouldn\u2019t.\n\u201cAlright, what I\u2019d really like to know first and foremost, what do you like to read. I don\u2019t want a typical answer.\u201d Harry leant back against his desk and crossed his arms. \u201cTell me what you get lost in. Tell me why.\u201d\nOne of the boys up front raised his hand and Harry nodded at him. \u201cMr Lieu?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if we don\u2019t like reading?\u201d the boy asked.\nThe class tittered a laugh, but Harry shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. Really. What do you like to do?\u201d\n\u201cI like my xbox,\u201d he said with a shrug, and a few of the other students nodded emphatically.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s perfectly valid. What games do you like to play?\u201d\nHe listed off a few and shrugged. \u201cI mean, I like loads so it\u2019s hard to choose.\u201d\n\u201cTell me why, then. Why those games?\u201d\nHe went on to explain the stories, the adventures, and when he was done, Harry was smiling.\n\u201cIt\u2019s similar, isn\u2019t it,\u201d Harry said. \u201cGames. Especially now, when you\u2019re given the option to take it as you like it. To create the story inside of a story. I know a lot of adults are going to tell you video games are rotting your brains but they\u2019re wrong. If you apply what you like though, in games to books, you might actually find yourself more interested in reading. I could recommend you many fantasy series I think you\u2019d enjoy.\u201d\nThere was a pause, then a pale hand shot into the air and Harry had the urge to just ignore him.\nInstead he took a breath. \u201cMr Ma\u2026\u201d His tongue got stuck on a name he hadn\u2019t uttered in years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Malfoy,\u201d the boy said, and his voice was not as sneering as his father\u2019s, but had the same lilt, same poshness to the accent. \u201cIt\u2019s French. Sort of. Means bad faith.\u201d\nHarry felt his heart hammering against his ribs, but he plastered on a smile. \u201cMr Malfoy. You\u2019ve something to add?\u201d\n\u201cWell not to what he said.\u201d Scorpius jutted his chin toward the video game boy. \u201cBut I wanted to say that not all books have to be fantasy in order to be enjoyable. I think there\u2019s a certain\u2014maybe better\u2014sort of magic in books with no magic in them at all.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s fingers threatened to shake, so he reached behind him and grabbed his mug of tea, squeezing it tight. \u201cIs that so? Would you care to elaborate?\u201d\n\u201cOne of my favourite books is called Island of the Blue Dolphins. About a girl who\u2026\u201d\nThe class erupted into a giggle and Harry distinctly heard the word pouf muttered in the back. His face went still. \u201cEnough,\u201d he said, his voice firm and almost angry. \u201cI don\u2019t know who said it, but I heard it and I will not tolerate bigotry of any sort in this class. Nor will it be tolerated in this school. And I\u2019d like to further point out there\u2019s nothing wrong with a woman main character. And it most certainly does not implicate anything about the reader.\u201d\nScorpius\u2019 cheeks were a bit pink, but his face was determined, like he\u2019d dealt with this before. \u201cAs I was saying, the woman in the book is left behind on an island to fend for herself. The book is really a fantasy in itself even though nothing out of the ordinary happens.\u201d\nHarry was nodding along, and there was something blooming in his chest for this kid. \u201cI know what you mean. I\u2019ve read it,\u201d and he smiled when Scorpius did. \u201cThe visuals are stunning and you hardly need a moment to be dragged into the pages.\u201d\n\u201cI just think finding magic in the ordinary is\u2026more interesting than say hopping through a wardrobe into a land of talking goats and lions and stuff.\u201d\nHarry laughed. \u201cI think some might argue. Some very stodgy classical fans, but,\u201d Harry stopped and winked, \u201clet it not be said I\u2019m one of them.\u201d\n*** \nHe managed to hold it together, and taking tea in his office, he finally let himself collapse in his chair. Scorpius had gone quiet after speaking up about the fantasy books, but Harry couldn\u2019t tell if he was speaking from experience\u2014much like the way Harry wanted to find the magic in the ordinary muggle world, or if there was something else. Perhaps this boy had never known magic. Perhaps his family had left it behind.\nTwenty minutes into his tea, there was a timid knock on his door. \u201cCome in,\u201d Harry called.\nA blonde head poked round the door and Harry felt his heart stutter again. \u201cMr Evans? Do you have a minute?\u201d\nHarry swallowed back his nerves and nodded. \u201cOf course Mr Malfoy. Come in.\u201d\nThe boy shut the door and he studied the chair in front of him before he plonked down and folded his arms in a defensive manner across his chest. \u201cI er\u2026I wanted to say that I know.\u201d\nHarry raised a brow. \u201cYou know.\u201d\n\u201cMy father doesn\u2019t if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about. But it\u2019s sort of hard to miss round certain parts of London.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s cheeks went hot and he took a swallow of his tea as an excuse to work at keeping himself composed. \u201cYour father.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re father\u2019s Draco Malfoy, you know all about the war and the sodding boy who lived.\u201d Scorpius\u2019 face went an immediate shade of crimson. \u201cSorry,\u201d he whispered.\nHarry, so taken aback, laughed and waved his hand. \u201cSodding boy who lived is rather\u2026apt.\u201d Sitting back, Harry let out a puff of air. \u201cWhy are you here? Why are you in my class?\u201d\n\u201cSchool,\u201d Scorpius said slowly.\n\u201cYes but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t get into Hogwarts without magic and as it is, I have none.\u201d Scorpius said it in a rush, like he\u2019d been holding it in all day. \u201cFather\u2019s\u2026he\u2019s tried his best, you know. I once heard gran talking to Aunt Andromeda about it. Said it was poetic justice. Had to look that one up, you know. They tried to home school me for a few years but after mother decided it wasn\u2019t worth her time\u2026\u201d\nHarry held up a hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr Malfoy. I\u2019m\u2026I need a moment to process everything.\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound sorry at all, just like his father, but Harry didn\u2019t care then. Draco\u2019d had a squib son and by some fucked up twist of fate or\u2026or whatever it was, he was now sat in Harry\u2019s class. \n\u201cDo you live in muggle London?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Father\u2019s got us a flat. Near the Ministry.\u201d\n\u201cWhere he works,\u201d Harry said, remembering his godfather\u2019s words.\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell him, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re scared about.\u201d\n\nScared, Potter?\n\nHarry let out a puff of air. \u201cI\u2019m not scared, Mr Malfoy. I merely feel that your father might not be entirely thrilled about you sitting in one of my classes.\u201d\nScorpius let out a very un-Malfoy like snort. \u201cNo he probably won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cAnd our parent\u2019s night is coming up. I\u2019ll be\u2026here,\u201d Harry finished weakly.\nScorpius shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s already put me in a dozen schools, so another won\u2019t really matter. But I just thought I should tell you that I knew. Because you were obvious and it only seemed fair.\u201d\nHarry mused at just how different this boy was than Draco had been, or even himself at that age. Course their lives, their childhoods were likely very different. Scorpius hadn\u2019t been taken from the magical world, but he would forever be outside of it, whether he wanted to or not.\n\u201cMr Evans?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s gaze snapped up. \u201cSorry. Was thinking. If you like, I can arrange a private meeting with your father. We\u2019ve\u2026that\u2019s to say we were never on the best terms but I think we can be amicable at this age. I can discuss with him your stay here. If you\u2019re not keen to leave already.\u201d\nScorpius visibly relaxed. \u201cI can\u2019t promise it\u2019ll go well. But\u2026I don\u2019t mind it. So much.\u201d\nHarry scribbled a note to Scorpius\u2019 father, fighting off every urge to give himself away. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you whether or not you want to tell him. You know him better than me.\u201d\nScorpius slipped the note into his pack and shrugged. \u201cFunny thing is, I probably don\u2019t. But I can\u2019t say a surprise wouldn\u2019t be hilarious, if anything. See you round, Mr Evans.\u201d\nThen he was gone and with that shock, Harry was near useless for the rest of the day.\n*** \nThe next morning, Harry was sat in his office with an over-brewed cup of coffee, cursing that no one at the damned school could ever work the machine properly, when his desk telephone began to ring. He eyed it, a sinking feeling in his gut before he picked it up.\n\u201cMr Evan\u2019s office, how can I help you?\u201d\nThere was a short pause before a voice said, \u201cHello, Mr Evans. My name is\u2026\u201d Another pause. \u201cMr Malfoy. I\u2019m Scorpius\u2019 father.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s heart was hammering in his chest, his stomach somewhere in his throat. \u201cAh. Yes, Mr Malfoy. Your son mentioned he might have you ring me.\u201d\n\u201cHe said we should arrange a meeting before the parent\u2019s night. Is there\u2026has there been a problem with my son?\u201d\n\u201cAh no. No, not as such. But we should probably have this discussion face to face.\u201d Harry wondered if he should just sodding tell Malfoy who he was, but then what would happen? He\u2019d never see Scorpius again, most likely and it sounded like the kid had been moved enough in his short life.\n\u201cIs there\u2026has there\u2026\u201d There was a pause, and Malfoy sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s had an unusual upbringing, so if it\u2019s something he\u2019s said\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI can assure you he was very well behaved and in fact I was impressed by his contributions in class.\u201d\nThere was a slight breath. \u201cAlright. Perhaps after school, then? I\u2019ll be finished at work early and I can stop by.\u201d\nHarry then gave Malfoy directions to his office, promising to be there after the students had been dismissed. He rang off, then stared at the telephone like it had grown Malfoy\u2019s actual head and was attempting to curse him. What was he thinking?\nHe was going to get hexed for this. He found himself for the first time in years, wishing he had his wand.\nThe day passed far too quickly for Harry\u2019s liking. He pulled Scorpius aside after the class and let him know the plan, and Scorpius had a small smirk playing round his mouth. \u201cShall I stay and mediate?\u201d\nHarry almost laughed, and wondered where this child had gotten his mischievous streak. Draco had been cunning, yes. And clever and very smart. But not playful at all. At least not that Harry had ever seen.\n\u201cI think it might be best if you let your father and I sort it out.\u201d\nScorpius nodded. \u201cAlright well\u2026\u201d He leant his head in. \u201cHave you got your wand?\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly.\u201d\nScorpius hummed. \u201cWell. That should be\u2026interesting. See you, Mr Evans.\u201d Then he was gone and Harry wondered what the hell he was really doing.\n*** \nSat at his desk again, Harry\u2019s foot tapped a staccato along the polished tile as he waited. He had his head bowed, and he was preparing himself for any flying curses. He hadn\u2019t used magic in ages, but once upon a time he could at least repel nasty hexes without a wand. Not his strongest suit but\u2026\nThe knock interrupted his thoughts, and he rose. \u201cCome in.\u201d\nHe braced himself.\nDraco Malfoy looked exactly the same, and yet nothing at all like the boy he\u2019d been at Hogwarts. His hair was still short, styled though not nearly as much hair grease. He was wearing muggle clothes\u2014trousers and form-fitted shirtsleeves. He had a hand in his pocket, the other braced on the knob, and his face was tight with anxiety.\n\u201cScorpius gave in and warned me it would be you, Potter.\u201d\nHarry deflated a little. \u201cRight. Yes. Ah\u2026good. I wasn\u2019t sure if I should have said on the call or\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGod, you\u2019re\u2026\u201d Malfoy huffed and then crossed the room, dropping into an empty chair. \u201cChrist.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Christ.\u201d Harry almost laughed when Draco\u2019s mouth quirked up at the corner. He sat down, hoping he\u2019d eased the tension at least a little. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel right about having Scorpius in my class unless you knew.\u201d\n\u201cThat Harry Jesus Christ Potter had abandoned his flock for muggle children?\u201d Draco asked. He rolled his eyes a little, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cWhy would you think I care?\u201d\nHarry shrugged. \u201cBecause I think I\u2019d care if I found out my child was taking classes from you.\u201d\n\u201cLast I heard you don\u2019t have children. Last I heard your bits and bobs got blown off in the final battle.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s cheeks pinked. \u201cI sincerely hope there are no children out in the corridor listening to this.\u201d\n\u201cScorpius is in the car with my mother. So we shouldn\u2019t keep this long.\u201d\nHarry let out a puff of air. \u201cRight. Your mother. In a\u2026car.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s adapting,\u201d Draco said.\nHarry realised that what was likely for the first time in his life, he was having some sort of conversation with Draco that wasn\u2019t beginning in sectum\u2014and ending in\u2014sempra. Or some equally dreadful hex. \u201cWell this is all I really wanted to say. And\u2026I suppose I\u2019d appreciate if you kept this to yourself.\u201d\n\u201cEmbarrassed?\u201d Draco smirked a little and Harry huffed.\n\u201cNo. More like I\u2019d rather not have reporters or\u2026old acquaintances knocking at my door. Present company excluded\u2014as I am required to communicate with the parents of my students.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s tongue ran along his bottom lip, causing Harry to lose his breath for a second, but he didn\u2019t appear to notice anything amiss. \u201cHow long have you been doing this, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cSchool\u2019s been open three years.\u201d\nDraco raised his hand, examining his nails. \u201cNot this school. I have the info on that. I mean this whole, living like a muggle rubbish.\u201d\n\u201cI grew up like a muggle\u2014before the wizarding world decided to use me as their fucking sacrificial lamb and send a sixteen year old boy after a wizarding mass murderer.\u201d Harry hadn\u2019t meant to sound so sharp, and he flushed when Draco\u2019s steel eyes locked on his. \u201cI mean to say, being a muggle is not rubbish, and I\u2019ve been out of the wizarding world since I was eighteen. I spent some time with my godfathers.\u201d\n\u201cRight. Black and Lupin.\u201d\nHarry let out a small breath and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t pull Scorpius from this school. It\u2019s\u2026this is a good place. It\u2019s a good education.\u201d\nDraco snorted and rolled his eyes again. \u201cI\u2019m well aware of that, Potter. You think I wouldn\u2019t do every available bit of research before putting my son in a school. I might not have grown up muggle, but I can adapt when I need to.\u201d\nHarry swallowed thickly, confused by this person sitting in front of him. But now was not the time to draw attention to it. \u201cRight. Well anyway, I suppose I should let you go. Wouldn\u2019t want your mother cross.\u201d\n\u201cHmm no, I expect not,\u201d Draco said with a wry grin. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll see you parent\u2019s night.\u201d\nHarry nodded, saying nothing as Draco rose and let himself out. The door shut with a gentle click, and Harry dropped his face into his hands. It hadn\u2019t gone badly, not really. He appreciated Scorpius coming clean about who he was if only to avoid surprise hexing. He wondered if it was the fact that he mentioned he was wandless that did it. Either way, Scorpius would stay and Harry wouldn\u2019t have to worry about blowing his cover.\nProvided Draco Malfoy kept his word.\nOf course he realised after some time, the blonde git hadn\u2019t given his word at all.\n*** \nHarry was too tempted to floo his godfathers, but he forced himself to process everything on his own as he\u2019d been doing for the last several years. He didn\u2019t sleep much that night, but with several coffees before he sat for his first class, he did okay.\nScorpius was, as usual, quiet but studious and put in his opinion when it was asked for. Luckily most of the day was lecture based, so Harry was able to focus on the information and not think too much about how there was a boy in his class who knew who he was. Who had heard the stories and the rumours\u2014and lord only knew what Malfoy had told his son about Saint Potter with his stupid scar.\nBut Scorpius sat without prejudice, and Harry attempted to do the same. He was not Snape. He would not torture a boy who clearly had dealt with enough over his short life.\nThe Thursday before Parent\u2019s night, Harry was supervising the students at mealtime, sitting at the corner of the staff table, when Scorpius wandered over. He hesitated before stopping. \u201cMr Evans?\u201d\n\u201cMr Malfoy, how are you today?\u201d\nScorpius shrugged. \u201cGran found out.\u201d\n\u201cNarcissa?\u201d Harry burst out before he could stop himself. He gave a slight cough. \u201cSorry.\u201d\nScorpius had a slight glint in his grey eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s not pleased about it. You. She thinks it\u2019s mad. She was furious with father when he forced her silence in the matter.\u201d\nHarry snorted. \u201cI can imagine.\u201d\n\u201cFather was shouting at her about how she owed you. He doesn\u2019t talk about it much. You know, what happened with\u2026\u201d Scorpius waved his thin hand. \u201cEverything.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect he would,\u201d Harry said softly. He glanced round but no one was paying them any mind.\n\u201cMy Aunt says I\u2019m poetic justice.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cWhich Aunt?\u201d\n\u201cAndromeda. I reckon she\u2019s talking about the fact that I\u2019m non-magical. Squib, I guess you wizards call it, but father gets furious if people call me that.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s cheeks were a little pink. Never in his life did he think he\u2019d hear that Draco Malfoy would be defending non-magical status in a wizarding bloodline. His child or not. But to think that even Andromeda would say that to the boy\u2026 \u201cI don\u2019t think sons pay for the sins of their fathers, Mr Malfoy. I wouldn\u2019t think too hard on it.\u201d\nScorpius let out a sigh. \u201cWell after everything I heard, honestly I\u2019m kind of glad not to be part of it. Sounds like it\u2019s more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\u201d\nHarry let out a surprised laugh. \u201cIt is that. Leaving the\u2026you know, world, it\u2019s difficult when you\u2019ve been entrenched in it for any number of years. I\u2019m impressed your father\u2019s done it. He must love you.\u201d\nScorpius sighed. \u201cI think so.\u201d\nHarry almost laughed again, thinking about Draco having muggle things, learning to use a telephone and a computer. He wondered if he carried round a mobile or used the internet. \u201cTrust me, I know so. He wouldn\u2019t do it for just anyone. The Draco I knew, at least back then, would find any way possible to shirk his responsibility for something he wasn\u2019t interested in. He was passionate though.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and look where that got him.\u201d Scorpius let out a sigh. \u201cI should go. See you tomorrow night, Mr Evans.\u201d\n*** \nTomorrow night. It was like a strange beacon off in the distance because where Harry had shunned everything magical, down to the very people who loved him most of all, there was a draw about Malfoy. The at-ease way he lounged in his office, perhaps, or maybe it was the fact that to Draco\u2014Harry had never been the Wizarding Saviour. Malfoy had never been charmed by the idea of it all.\nAs far as Harry knew. And if he had, he\u2019d well kept it to himself and that made a difference.\nHe was all nerves as he sat at his desk in the classroom and waited for the parents to arrive. The teachers were holding fifteen minute sessions with their classes, students hadn\u2019t been invited only to allow parents the freedom to ask questions if they chose to.\nSo there he was. Nervous. Clutching hard coffee in his trembling hands hoping no one would notice. He was leant against his desk, one leg crossed over the other in an attempt to look casual, though anyone who knew him even for a moment would be able to see the tension. As always, Harry Potter wore his emotions on his sleeve.\nThe parents began to file in, and Harry waited until the very last second before he began, but there was no Draco Malfoy. He tried not to feel the stinging disappointment as he began. \u201cHello. My name is Harry Evans, and I\u2019m the English teacher. This year I\u2019m only teaching the year sevens, but we hope to expand a bit and I may have them again in the future as they work toward their GCSEs. At the present time they\u2019ll have me for English and Literature.\u201d He went a bit further now, into the curriculum, and as he did, the door opened and a tousled blonde walked in, mouthing an apology.\nHarry waved it off, gesturing for him to sit as he went on. \u201cAre there any questions?\u201d\nThere were a few. Basic ones, mostly. What would they be reading? Will controversial material be sent home before it\u2019s taught? How will this help them toward their exams?\nHe answered all the questions, then dismissed them, allowing ten minutes for a meet and greet.\n\u201cLaura just loves your classes,\u201d one excited mother was saying.\nHarry nodded, smiling as he watched Draco drift toward the door, but halting and moving back again. His heart was thudding in his chest. \u201cAh well, she\u2019s a delight, really.\u201d\n\u201cWell she can\u2019t shut up about it. You know, you\u2019re the talk of the school. Always the dashing ones.\u201d\nHarry felt his cheeks heat up. \u201cAh yes well\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShe says you\u2019re not married. You know my daughter just finished university and\u2026\u201d\nHarry\u2019d had this before, and he gave her a smile. \u201cVery kind of you, really. But I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s frowned upon at the school, dating family members of students. But I\u2019m sure she\u2019s very lovely.\u201d\nLaura\u2019s mum\u2019s face dropped. \u201cOh well. If the policy changes\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI will indeed let you know.\u201d\nThe parents were all filing out now, and Draco eased up toward Harry. \u201cMerlin\u2019s balls even when you\u2019re not famous they\u2019re all over you.\u201d\nHarry allowed himself a full blush, shaking his head. \u201cWell meaning parents always trying to pawn off their daughters. Bit sexist, really.\u201d\nOne elegant eyebrow lifted. \u201cSexist. Social justice champion are you. I thought you hadn\u2019t spoken to Granger in ages.\u201d\nHarry felt his stomach squirm at the mention of Hermione. \u201cWeasley, you mean.\u201d\nDraco snorted. \u201cYou really have been gone that long?\u201d\nHarry let out a puff of air. \u201cWould it offend you if I tell you I don\u2019t want to know?\u201d\nDraco laughed. \u201cYou honestly think I care, Potter? Er\u2026Evans, if you prefer.\u201d\n\u201cPotter\u2019s\u2026er. Fine. So long as no one hears it.\u201d Harry ran his hand into his hair, then reached back for his tepid tea and took a sip. \u201cDid you\u2026do you\u2026have any questions? About Scorpius or\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Draco was quiet a moment, one hand slipping into the pocket of his trousers. \u201cI never really worry about him. He\u2019s assimilating just fine.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has he been in the muggle world?\u201d\n\u201cMother learnt he wasn\u2019t on the Hogwarts list a few weeks after he was born,\u201d Draco said with a shrug. \u201cAfter Astoria and I split, I decided investing in a flat was for the best. So\u2026\u201d Draco\u2019s eyes rolled up to the ceiling. \u201cSince he was four. He\u2019s been exposed to both, but doesn\u2019t have a lot of interest in the wizarding world.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t imagine that he would.\u201d Harry pursed his lips. \u201cWell I\u2019m glad you could make it. This was only about a third of the parents, you know. I understand so many are busy but it\u2019s never easy for me to see parents who refuse to be invested in their children.\u201d\nDraco looked at Harry for a long time. \u201cAnd you never had any? Not even with a muggle?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s cheeks took on another pink tinge because that was another thing. Not that anyone ever knew\u2014and it wasn\u2019t because he would be judged, especially after knowing Remus and Sirius\u2014but after Ginny there was really no appeal for him when it came to women. It had come to him easy enough, a night out with some flatmates at University and a few drunken snogs with the lads here and there.\nBut it was more than that, because he just didn\u2019t feel he should be a parent. Not with everything he\u2019d walked away from. To bring a child into that world\u2026\n\u201cEr. No. Not really in my cards.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because you don\u2019t like them. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Draco said with a slight sneer. \u201cSo what is it?\u201d\nHarry barked out a laugh and shook his head. \u201cMalfoy, do you really think I should parent? That I\u2019d know the first thing about it? It\u2019s one thing to teach them muggle literature, but it\u2019s quite a-bloody-nother to be responsible for everything else.\u201d\n\u201cSome of us got over ourselves,\u201d Draco said with a huff. \u201cYou weren\u2019t the only one who suffered.\u201d\nHarry recoiled like he\u2019d been slapped. \u201cI\u2026\u201d But what could he say to that? \u201cRight.\u201d\nDraco let out a small sigh, then took a step back. \u201cNight, Potter. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d\nDeflated, Harry sagged against the desk and wondered how he\u2019d let that just go. Just like that. For all his fighting and insisting this was what he needed, and Draco had undone him with two short sentences. Funny part of it was, it wasn\u2019t the first time someone had said that to Harry. It was just the first time he\u2019d listened.\n*** \nAn hour later, Harry retired to his office to grab his keys and a stack of essays to grade, when something at the edge of his desk caught his eye. It was a small, round box. Something he hadn\u2019t seen since the Hogwarts Express. A Chocolate Frog.\nThe box on the side had been opened, and when he pried the top off, the small frog sat immobile, just on top of the card which was sitting face down. There was a small note scribbled to a spare bit of parchment on the bottom.\nH.\nScorpius opened this earlier. He\u2019s already got one, so I thought you could use it. I\u2019ve immobilised the frog and card, so as not to alarm the muggles.\nD. Malfoy\nHarry fingered the top of the box, then reached under the frog to pull out the card. It took him by absolute surprise to see his seventeen year old face staring back at him. On the back was the short bio.\nHarry James Potter, The Boy Who Lived.\nAt seventeen, Harry defeated the Dark Lord Voldemort during the battle at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Since the defeat, Harry has disappeared from the limelight and rumour has it is working with the American Wizarding Society in an attempt to prevent someone like Voldemort from rising to power again.\nWith a loud snort, Harry set the card down on the desk. He picked up the frog, and though before this moment would have never eaten anything that had come from Draco Malfoy, took a bite of the frog and let the old, familiar taste take him back to that first train ride when he was still enthralled by discovering that not only was magic real, but that it was very much a part of him.\n*** \nBent over his kitchen table, a red marking pen in hand, Harry looked up when there was a tapping at his door. Frowning, he assumed it had to be a neighbour and threw it open, his eyes widening in surprise when he saw his godfathers grinning at him.\n\u201cWe brought take-away,\u201d Sirius said, waving a paper sack which smelt heavily of curry. \u201cCan we come in?\u201d\nHarry coughed, stepping aside. \u201cEr. Course. But what er\u2026what are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cWell we\u2019ve come for the gossip, of course,\u201d Remus said, walking to the table to deposit the second sack of take-away. \u201cHave you got dishes?\u201d\n\u201cCabinets,\u201d Harry said, and watched Remus busy himself with plates and forks. \u201cGossip?\u201d\n\u201cMalfoy gossip. Didn\u2019t hear a word after your impromptu visit,\u201d Remus said.\nSirius pulled a chair back and began to remove the containers of curry, rice, and naan. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d\nHarry scooped up the essays lest they be stained, and plonked them down on the counter a few paces away. \u201cIt er. It was weird,\u201d he said with a shrug. He watched Remus dish out food and he took the plate as he sat in his vacated seat. \nSirius rummaged through Harry\u2019s kitchen, coming back with three beers, and uncapped them with a wave of his hand. Harry felt something catch in his chest at the casual magic, but he didn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cCould you elaborate?\u201d Remus smiled at him over his beer bottle.\nHarry sighed. \u201cWell. He came for a quick chat. His son had already told him who I was so there was no big surprise there. He was\u2026amicable.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him round the Ministry,\u201d Remus said with a nod as he dipped some of his naan in the curry. \u201cHe\u2019s been, for the most part, apathetic which is all I can ask for really. As a werewolf.\u201d\nHarry felt his face go a little hot at the idea that after everything he\u2019d done, all they\u2019d been through, there was still such a prejudice. \u201cHe came to parent\u2019s night as well. Brought me a chocolate frog.\u201d\nSirius choked on his swallow of beer. \u201cA chocolate frog?\u201d\n\u201cWith my card,\u201d Harry said.\nRemus smiled wider. \u201cAh. Harry Potter the American wizarding champion.\u201d\nHarry couldn\u2019t help his laugh. \u201cBit ridiculous, isn\u2019t it? Who fed them that?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to be found,\u201d Remus said, shrugging. \u201cThought it might be best to steer them in the wrong direction.\u201d\nHarry grinned. \u201cWell. Thanks, I suppose. Anyway that\u2019s it, really. I mean, I guess he\u2019s been living in muggle London as he found out Scorpius was a squib from an early age. Got divorced. His son seems fairly well adjusted.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Sirius asked. He took a large bite of his dinner.\n\u201cI reckon. He knows though, Scorpius. That things are\u2026different for him. He overheard someone call it poetic justice.\u201d\n\u201cThat Malfoy had a squib?\u201d Sirius said, his voice thick with food. \u201cI suppose it is, a bit.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026no,\u201d Harry said, shaking his head. He stared at his untouched food. \u201cIt\u2019s not his fault. Being a muggle isn\u2019t a punishment for your parents\u2019 transgressions. That\u2019s\u2026you can\u2019t put that on a child.\u201d\nRemus gave Harry a careful look. \u201cWe know.\u201d\nHarry shook his head. \u201cBut imagine him growing up hearing that. What\u2019s he to think?\u201d\nThere was a decided quiet over the table. After a moment, Sirius stood up and came to stand behind Remus, putting his hands on the werewolf\u2019s shoulders. \u201cGoing out for a smoke.\u201d\nRemus tilted his head up. \u201cGive us a kiss, love.\u201d\nSirius bent down, obliging, then headed for the door, letting it close with a gentle click on his way out.\nHarry watched him go, then turned back to Remus. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for getting upset. But he\u2019s a good kid and I know what it\u2019s like to grow up with people whispering about everything you do. That feeling that you need to\u2026fulfil something, you know? Or that you\u2019re the product of something outside of your control.\u201d\nRemus gave a slow nod. \u201cBut if he\u2019s well adjusted as you say he is, there\u2019s probably a good chance that Draco\u2019s combating it as best he can. And keeping his boy in the muggle world I\u2019m sure helps a great deal.\u201d\nHarry shrugged, leaning back. \u201cReckon it is. At least no one at the school knows him. Students find his name a bit funny but no one guesses about his background.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. And not that I want to push you, but maybe being exposed like this will be good for you as well. You can\u2019t hid forever, Harry. Even if you want to stay living as a muggle, magic will always be part of you. No amount of running will make the past go away.\u201d\nHarry looked down at his hands and let out another sigh. \u201cI know. I\u2019m just\u2026afraid of how much it\u2019s going to hurt when I let it all back in.\u201d\n*** \nA month later, Harry was walking out to his car when he spotted someone leaning against the bonnet. Draco stood there in jeans and a plain black t-shirt, one arm crossed over his chest, the other hanging low with a pinched, lit cigarette between his fingers.\nHe watched Harry with hooded grey eyes, bringing the fag to his lips and taking a long, slow drag. His mouth curved into what might be considered a smile as Harry stalled, then picked up his pace again.\n\u201cPotter.\u201d\n\u201cEr. Malfoy. Something I can help you with?\u201d\n\u201cMy ex-wife just picked up Scorpius for her monthly visitation.\u201d\nHarry blinked in surprise. Scorpius steadfastly refused to mention his mum in any capacity, speaking mostly of his father, and occasionally his gran. But that was it, and Harry had wondered if he ever saw her.\n\u201cShe picked him up from here?\u201d\n\u201cIt makes the transition easier,\u201d Draco said with a shrug. He glanced over his shoulder at Harry\u2019s car, then let out a sigh. \u201cTake me for a drink, Potter. I feel like shit.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s eyes widened, but in spite of every fibre of his being saying it was a bad idea, he nodded and unlocked the doors so Draco could get in. The blonde crushed the cigarette under the heel of his shoe, then climbed in. \n\u201cAny place in particular.\u201d\n\u201cYour local is fine.\u201d\n\u201cEr.\u201d Harry switched on the car and Draco laughed.\n\u201cEloquent as ever. Is there a problem?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Harry cleared his throat. \u201cI think I\u2019m just having a moment. Draco Malfoy wants to have a drink with Saint Potter.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was a long pause, then Draco threw his head back and laughed. \u201cFucking go. I\u2019m too sober.\u201d\nHarry wasted no time pulling out onto the main road and heading up to his flat. The pub was just round the corner, so he parked and glanced up, debating about taking his things up.\n\u201cYou live here?\u201d Draco glanced at the door.\n\u201cYeah. Just\u2026let me bang my stuff down and we can go.\u201d After a moment\u2019s pause, \u201cCome up if you want.\u201d\nIt seemed Draco couldn\u2019t resist, and he followed Harry in through the doors, up three flights of stairs to the second floor landing, and Harry\u2019s was first on the left. He stuck his key into the lock and pushed it open.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind the mess.\u201d\nDraco looked round as Harry put his brief case on the table, and put his morning tea mug into the sink. The flat was tidy for the most part, a few stray papers here and there, and the odd jumper hanging from the back of a chair. But it was homely and comfortable.\nHe had art on the walls, books in the shelves, a telly mounted, and his fireplace.\n\u201cHooked up to floo?\u201d Draco asked, dipping his fingers into the pot.\n\u201cCharmed shut most of the time, but yeah. My godfathers use it from time to time.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice was half-muffled by the shirt he was changing into, not interested in drinking in his teaching clothes. \u201cWhy, you need it?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Draco backed up and peered down the corridor, waiting for Harry. \u201cYou\u2019ve got no photos, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI only know wizards,\u201d Harry said, and came out from his bedroom, his hair a mess, glasses somewhat crooked. \u201cIf I bring work mates back for any reason, how the hell would I explain moving photos?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t muggles have those thingies now? From the internet?\u201d\nHarry laughed. \u201cNot in photo frames.\u201d He reached for his keys on the table and shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a short walk if you\u2019re still interested.\u201d\nThere was a flicker of disappointment on Draco\u2019s face, but it was schooled away and he nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d\nThe pair walked near silently down the street and round the corner to the pub. It was a decent sort of place, good imports on tap, and not a lot of fuss. They found a high table near the end of the bar and sat, and both ordered a pint.\n\u201cChips as well,\u201d Draco said after a moment.\nThey fell into a silence for a while, watching the crowd, occasionally looking at each other, and Harry had to wonder what the hell he was really doing there. Was he honestly at a muggle pub with Draco Sodding Malfoy having chips and a pint? Of all the bloody things\u2026\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d the server said. \u201cStarting a tab.\u201d\nDraco reached into his pocket, found a card, and handed it over. \u201cAll on one. Thanks.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Potter,\u201d Draco said. \u201cMy family name might have been violently besmirched by that maniac, but I\u2019m still richer than you on a teaching salary.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s eyebrows went up. \u201cAnd you do realise that my parents left me a ridiculous amount of gold that didn\u2019t just disappear when I left the wizarding world.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re rich.\u201d\nHarry snorted into his pint. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cWell fuck me. Next night out\u2019s on you, then.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s eyebrow lifted as something in his head screamed, next night out! But he said nothing. He stole a few of Draco\u2019s chips and drank half his pint before saying anything else. \u201cSo how\u2019s it working for the Ministry?\u201d\nDraco let out a sardonic laugh and shook his head. \u201cReally? That\u2019s what you want to ask me of all bloody things?\u201d\nHarry shrugged. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s shit, Potter. How do you think it is? It\u2019s still the sodding Ministry. My job is shit, and no one cares for me\u2014which honestly makes it easier to avoid small talk, and everyone wants to know how Draco Malfoy managed to produce a squib.\u201d\nHarry winced. \u201cI\u2026you know I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair to him.\u201d\n\u201cHim?\u201d\n\u201cScorpius.\u201d Harry sighed, ruffling his hair again.\n\u201cStop that. It makes you look ridiculous.\u201d Draco\u2019s hand reached over and curled round Harry\u2019s wrist, dragging it down. Harry felt his breath catch in his throat when he felt Draco on his skin. The long, slender fingers were filled with fire, coursing up and down his arm. Draco paused, then carefully removed his hand.\n\u201cI mean to say,\u201d Harry said, forcing himself to catch his breath, \u201che knows. He hears things.\u201d\nDraco looked away, then let out a sigh. \u201cI know he does. I\u2019m trying as hard as I can but I figure there\u2019s no point in trying to shield him from it. So I just tell him the truth. His entire fucking family were blood purist pig-dogs and any time he comes near a wizard, the first thing they\u2019re going to think is, \u2018Ha! That Draco Malfoy sure got his.\u2019 It makes him less than enthusiastic to be round wizards.\u201d\n\u201cI expect so.\u201d Harry licked his lips, not sure what else to say.\n\u201cProbably why he\u2019s keen on you so much,\u201d Draco went on. He grabbed the last chip from the basket and bit of the end, chewing thoughtfully. \u201cI guess it helps you shun us the way he wishes he could\u2014and likely will soon as he\u2019s of age. But maybe seeing a wizard willingly apart from all that insular rubbish helps.\u201d\nHarry felt a warmth in his belly. \u201cHe\u2019s a good kid. Interesting. Insightful. Funny. Never would have guessed he was yours.\u201d\nDraco smirked. \u201cOnly because you never got to know me.\u201d\nHarry raised his eyebrows. \u201cOh really? You\u2019re funny, are you?\u201d\nDraco lifted his chin. \u201cI happen to be extremely funny, Potter. It\u2019s not my fault your sense of humour is rubbish.\u201d\nThis time, Harry did laugh and found himself leaning just a little bit closer to Draco.\n\u00a0\n*** \nSo it became routine, that once a month when Astoria picked up Scorpius from school, Harry would find Draco waiting by his car. They\u2019d head over to Harry\u2019s while he\u2019d change, then go to either the pub or the small curry restaurant round the corner and spend a few hours chatting.\nAnd it was nice. Harry learnt Ron and Hermione never did marry. Hermione was making waves on the legal front of Magical Creatures\u2014working in tandem with Remus who confirmed it later when Harry floo\u2019d his godfathers to ask about it.\nRon married eventually, a woman who\u2019d been one year below them and had been in Hufflepuff. \u201cEr. I think she\u2019s called Amanda or something. Honestly I can\u2019t be arsed to remember. Ron worked at the Ministry for about ten minutes before he buggered off to help his brothers.\u201d\n\u201cFred and George?\u201d Harry asked.\n\u201cJoke shop,\u201d Draco said with a shrug. \u201cMad place, that.\u201d\nHarry laughed. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m silent partner. I think. I gave them what I won from the Tri-Wizard Tournament to open it.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s eyebrows went up. \u201cYou what?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need the money and the entire fucking tournament was fixed by Crouch.\u201d\n\u201cJunior, right?\u201d\nHarry nodded, spearing a bit of lamb from the curry bowl. He chewed for a moment, then washed it down with a drink of his beer. \u201cFelt wrong to use it for anything else.\u201d\nDraco said nothing for a while. Then he caught Harry up on a few other things. Ginny played Quidditch, had a few public relationships with both men and women. Harry was far from surprised by that. Neville was a professor, Luna took over for her father, and the rest of the Weasleys were as they\u2019d always been.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t stop to chat when I see them in the corridors or the lifts,\u201d Draco said with a shrug, \u201cbut I also can\u2019t help but hear things.\u201d\nHarry smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026you know I thought it would be terrible, hearing all these things. Remus and Sirius have got strict orders to keep anything wizard to themselves.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucking ridiculous, Potter. I\u2019m amazed you survived.\u201d\nHarry laughed. \u201cNearly didn\u2019t. I mean I actually did die, you know. But sorted it out in the end.\u201d\nDraco laughed and he pushed the bowl away from himself. \u201cReckon you did.\u201d He stretched up and put his arms behind his head. \u201cYou want to go back to yours? I\u2019m uncomfortable here.\u201d\nHarry tried not to feel the thumping in his chest at the request. \u201cEr. Yeah, alright. I\u2019ve got drinks.\u201d\nDraco smirked, then got up to pay the bill and then followed Harry out onto the street. They didn\u2019t say much as they walked toward Harry\u2019s flat, but once or twice their hands brushed together. Harry couldn\u2019t be sure, but that once or twice it felt like Draco was lingering.\nWhen they got in, Harry grabbed a couple beers from the fridge and they sat on Harry\u2019s sofa. \u201cYou want me to put on the telly or music or something?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019ve you got?\u201d\nHarry got up and thumbed through his CDs. \u201cSirius got me all this punk seventies shit. I mean, it\u2019s not shit, actually. You want slow or fast?\u201d\n\u201cSlow\u2019s better for conversation, innit?\u201d\nHarry couldn\u2019t help but agree, so he chose a Bowie CD and put it on. Eventually the sounds of crooning filled the flat, though he kept it low, and he resumed his seat.\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t you have a girlfriend?\u201d Draco asked, pointedly and blunt.\nHarry choked on his drink. \u201cSorry?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re attractive. Even to muggles. I see your co-workers trying to catch your eye. You\u2019re telling me you never pull any of them?\u201d\nHarry coughed, trying to catch his breath. \u201cAh. Er. Well, no. I don\u2019t.\u201d He ran his hand through his hair, then remembered Draco telling him how ridiculous it made him look and he stopped. \u201cThing is, I\u2019m gay.\u201d\nDraco was silent, then his mouth curved into a smile. \u201cHarry Potter\u2019s a pouf. Does anyone know?\u201d\nHarry shrugged. \u201cDidn\u2019t really work it out until University. So probably not. Well, maybe Sirius and Remus, but we don\u2019t talk about it a lot.\u201d\n\u201cYou think they\u2019ve spotted it since they\u2019re bent?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s cheeks went pink. \u201cLike I said, we don\u2019t exactly talk about those things.\u201d\n\u201cCourse you don\u2019t. I swear to Merlin\u2019s saggy bollocks, one of these days you\u2019re going to have all that repressed shit erupt like a bloody geyser and you\u2019re going to blow up half the fucking block.\u201d\nHarry stared, then he laughed. \u201cGod. You\u2019re probably right.\u201d\n\u201cI know I am. You need a few dozen therapy sessions and at least that many shags. You ever get any?\u201d\n\u201cHah. Er. Not as much. Not lately.\u201d\n\u201cSince?\u201d Draco pushed.\nHarry looked away. \u201cUniversity.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a virgin, are you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said, his voice furious. \u201cAnd what\u2019s my sex-life to you, Malfoy? You personally invested.\u201d\nDraco quirked a brow but said nothing. So Harry pushed again.\n\u201cYou want a go? See what it\u2019s like to fuck the Saviour?\u201d\n\u201cTouchy,\u201d Draco said, holding up his hand. \u201cThough hypothetically, what would you do if I said yes? That I\u2019d love to rip that stupid muggle jumper off you and leave you fuck-stupid hours later.\u201d\nHarry nearly choked on his own tongue, and it took him a full two minutes to regain his bearings. \u201cHypothetically speaking?\u201d\nDraco\u2019s smirk widened. \u201cWell. Depending on your answer.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking. You\u2019re\u2026fucking. You\u2019re fucking joking. You\u2019re having me on.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be having you off, if you know what I mean.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s face bloomed bright red. \u201cMalfoy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Draco mocked. \u201cYou never noticed it? You think I followed you round because I didn\u2019t like you?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026yeah,\u201d Harry said, his voice going high and tight. \u201cYou\u2026we\u2026we didn\u2019t like each other.\u201d\nDraco laughed. \u201cNo, we really didn\u2019t. I fucking hated you. But I also wanted to fuck you. Because you\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d\nHarry sputtered and blinked. \u201cI\u2026er\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I am?\u201d Draco asked, almost like a challenge.\nHarry licked his lips. \u201cWell er\u2026\u201d He wanted to stop himself from remembering all those nights he would lay in bed thinking about Draco. Obsessing over him, really. What he was doing, where he was going, what he would say if he saw him in the corridor. And he told himself it was all just because Draco was on his way to becoming a Dark Wizard and it was Harry\u2019s job to stop him.\nBut that wasn\u2019t it.\nBecause he\u2019d saved Draco\u2019s life. And Draco had saved his.\n\u201cYou mastered my wand once,\u201d Draco said, his voice low, \u201cyou want to master it again?\u201d\nHarry stared, then burst into laughter, not missing Draco\u2019s pleased smirk. \u201cOh my god. Oh god how long have you been waiting to use that?\u201d\n\u201cYears.\u201d Draco spread his arms out along the back of the sofa. \u201cI\u2019m not joking though. Fifteen bloody years later and I still want to snog your face off.\u201d\n\u201cIs that why you\u2019re being so nice?\u201d Harry asked. He realised he was edging closer, and stopped himself.\nAll the humour drained from Draco\u2019s face. \u201cYou really think I\u2019m that horrible.\u201d\nHarry swallowed. \u201cWell er. No. I just\u2026fuck Malfoy, I haven\u2019t seen you since we were seventeen and I was trying to commit a murder. We weren\u2019t exactly friends. It\u2019s natural to assume you might have an ulterior motive.\u201d\nDraco sighed, then set his beer down on the low table and stood up. \u201cRight. Good to know you haven\u2019t changed at all. No matter how long you spend away.\u201d\nHe was walking away. Harry\u2019s brain sort of stuttered as he watched Draco head for the door, and then panic set in. His legs began to act of their own accord, dragging him up and over. His hands betrayed him, reaching out and grabbing Draco by the back of his shirt, spinning him round before he could wrench the door open.\n\u201cWait. Malfoy\u2026Draco. Just\u2026sodding wait a second.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s eyes were narrow. \u201cPotter I\u2026\u201d\nBut he couldn\u2019t say more as Harry had pushed himself forward, lips almost touching his. \u201cI want to kiss you,\u201d Harry breathed. \u201cCan I\u2026er\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking daft,\u201d Draco growled before fisting his hand in the front of Harry\u2019s shirt and yanking him in. The kiss wasn\u2019t kind. It was a bit hard, dry lips and sharp teeth. But they moulded to each other in an almost desperate way, Draco\u2019s long fingers curling round the back of Harry\u2019s neck, Harry\u2019s hands grasping at Draco\u2019s thin shoulders.\nHarry let out a sort of breathless moan as he let his lips open, and Draco rewarded him by slipping his tongue in, hot and wet and needy.\n\u201cOh. Fuck.\u201d Harry pulled back, his head spinning. \u201cDraco\u2026what the hell are we doing?\u201d\n\u201cSnogging. Jesus, are you a virgin?\u201d\nHarry growled and pulled Draco in again, this time taking the kiss bossy and forceful. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a fucking virgin. But you\u2019re Draco Malfoy and your tongue was in my mouth and I\u2019m hard as a rock right now and all I can think about is throwing you on my sofa and shagging you until you can\u2019t remember your name.\u201d\n\u201cThen what the fuck are you waiting for?\u201d Draco demanded.\nIt was really all Harry needed. He spun him, backing him up hard and fast across the floor. Hands were tearing at clothes, feet kicking shoes off to the side, and they fell into the cushions, Draco on his back, Harry crouched between his crooked knees. Their groins pushed together, hard and hot, a sort of thrusting motion as their cocks aligned, desperate and begging for friction.\nTheir mouths hardly parted, trying to know each other inside and out. Hands were everywhere and Harry lost sense of where he began, and Draco ended. But that didn\u2019t matter. Not when Draco shifted his hips and oh god\u2026\u201dOh god,\u201d he breathed. \u201cOh shit. Draco oh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Yes. Fuck, Potter. Oh right there.\u201d Draco shifted again and put his hands between them, taking one cock in each fist as Harry thrust against those slender fingers.\nHe lowered his head, kissing and biting at Draco\u2019s neck as his hips pushed back and forth, harder, faster, the rhythm he craved.\n\u201cOh I\u2019m oh shit. I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAre you coming?\u201d Draco lifted his head to look between their bodies. \u201cThat\u2019s the fucking hottest\u2026\u201d Draco bucked his own hips hard. \u201cOh shit yes come for me Harry.\u201d\nHarry obeyed, like he was always meant to. His body seized and his head bowed low, breath coming out like a hiss between them. Through foggy eyes he saw Draco shivering with his own orgasm, their white fluid pooling together on Draco\u2019s naked stomach.\nWhen it was over, it was all Harry could do not to collapse on top of Draco. His elbows were shaking, and Draco let out a small laugh, shifting over so Harry could fall between his body and the back of the sofa.\n\u201cJesus, if I knew you fucked like that, I would have tried to find you ages ago,\u201d Draco breathed. \u201cI know you hate magic, but d\u2019you mind if I\u2026?\u201d\nHarry shook his head and Draco cast a wandless scourgify over their bodies. Harry shivered as they were cleaned up, and then he laid his head down on Draco\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThat was um\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nHarry flushed. \u201cI\u2019d like to do that again.\u201d\nDraco threw his head back and laughed. \u201cWould you, now?\u201d\nBlinking up, Harry reached up with a shaking hand and brushed a bit of Draco\u2019s blonde fringe away from his forehead. \u201cYeah. I would. Unless you\u2019ve got someone better to get home to.\u201d\n\u201cAre you joking? Potter, this is my fifteen year old fantasy come to life. But better. So much fucking better.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s eyebrows went up. \u201cFifteen year old fantasy?\u201d\n\u201cWell, back then it was more post-Quidditch hate-sex than fucking on your sofa. But close enough.\u201d After some hesitation, Draco put his arm on Harry\u2019s shoulder and pulled him in for another kiss. \u201cBut yeah. I think I\u2019d like to do that again. And again. You know, for as long as you\u2019d have me here.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s eyes slipped closed and he felt a wash of contentment. He didn\u2019t know what the hell it was, but the idea of as long as he\u2019d have Draco felt warm and soothing. So he nodded. \u201cYeah. I think I could stand that. For a long, long damn time.\u201d\nDraco sighed and Harry could feel the grin against the top of his head. \u201cGood.\u201d"
