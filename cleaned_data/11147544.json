    "text": "\nOn the home page of Muscle Pig Delivery Service it did specifically say 'We Deliver Everywhere!', but that didn't mean Jungkook had expected to get an order from a business district in Gangnam on 33 vegetarian sandwiches.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHonestly Jungkook's fanciest delivery until now was a few cakes for a shotgun wedding, and driving onto the parking lot of a high-rise skyscraper on his ratty motorcycle looked\u00a0a little sad. He parked his bike between two humongous SUVs, took off his helmet and stared at the intimidating glass building. Everyone walking in and out of the front doors were dressed in stylish suits, and Jungkook took one look down at his ripped jeans and sighed.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n Whatever. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile Gangnam was generally considered intimidating in Jungkook's books, it also meant money, and Jungkook had counted a lot of zeros behind the sum his employer offered for the delivery of these vegetarian sandwiches.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook pulled the box off the back of his motorcycle, grabbed his bag with the card machine his co-worker Jiwoo had invested in for their small company, and walked towards the front doors of the high-rise building. He entered with a throng of businessmen just finishing their lunch break, and took a swift turn towards the reception area upon realizing he had no idea where he was going.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe cleared his throat awkwardly in front of the disastrously bored-looking receptionist.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Hello,\" Jungkook greeted, \"I have a delivery for a Kim Namjoon from Bangtan Magazine?\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook thought it was an awful name for a fashion magazine, but maybe that's why he wasn't in the fashion industry.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lunch hour, I\u2019ll call their office for you to make sure he\u2019s in,\" the receptionist said, pressing a button on the phone in front of her. She placed the phone to her ear, all while keeping uncomfortable eye contact with Jungkook. \"Hello, this is the lobby reception. There's a delivery for Kim Namjoon.\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook didn't hear what was being said on the phone, but tried to look very interested in the art hanging over them to avoid a sudden, awkward staring contest. He probably looked very out of place.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Kim Namjoon is not in his office right now, he's working on a photoshoot,\" the reception finally said after a short while on the phone. \"I suppose that's where your delivery is going. Floor 16, studio 3.\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Thank you.\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook didn't forget his manners and bowed at the receptionist while taking his leave towards the elevators. He entered with a rowdy bunch of office-workers, all of them talking animatedly about some deadline, and Jungkook barely managed to press the button for floor 16 before being squeezed into a corner.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey barely let him out of the elevator again a little later, as if Jungkook's presence was bothering them somehow, and Jungkook stumbled into a pretty bare hallway with a large, red, '16' painted on the wall. The door to studio 3 was already in sight, and Jungkook could hear loud voices from inside, incoherent arguments floating into the hallway.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook used his elbow to press down the handle and kicked he door open with his foot, entering a large studio set; he saw a large array of artificial plants in front of a blue screen and tall, pretty girls in swimsuits surrounded by cameras. He only managed to take the scene in for a few seconds before being interrupted by a harsh voice.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Who are you?\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook tried his hardest not to gape at the man talking to him, but he had always been horrible at masking his expressions. The stranger had a deep voice but a small, pretty face, tan skin and bleached blond hair falling across his forehead. His eyes were large, he had a sharp nose and full lips, and Jungkook's eyes fretted between the many piercings in his ears. He was taller than Jungkook by quite a lot, but Jungkook only realized why when letting his eyes travel down his intricately patterned suit to the tall designer heels on his feet.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Uhm,\" Jungkook started, not knowing where to look, \"I'm just here with the delivery -\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe guy didn't seem to have heard him, his head snapping around to look over his shoulder at someone shouting loudly about the lighting. His ear-piercings made soft, jingling sounds and Jungkook was immensely distracted by the guy's side profile, so much that he almost forgot what the hell he was even there for.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Ah,\" the guy said when he turned around again, wide eyes scrutinizing Jungkook's attire as he chewed obnoxiously on the piece of sweet-smelling gum in his mouth, \"you must be the new intern.\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNo, Jungkook thought in panic, no, I'm absolutely not. His mouth was opening and closing but no sound seemed to come out, and it didn't seem like this guy was listening either, eyes moving towards the set behind them. It was like he had already decided Jungkook was the intern.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Put the food on the table over there, the models will get hungry and are allowed a break in about thirty minutes.\" The guy was sizing him up again, managing to blow a small, pink bubble with his gum with a grimace on his face. \"I'm Kim Taehyung, fashion editor. You better discard that sweater before tomorrow or I will personally burn it.\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook stared down at his black sweater, frown on his face. This was a brand name sweater, and one of Jungkook's favorites, even. He always wore it to work because it covered all of his tattoos, so old ladies wouldn\u2019t deduct payment for how he looked. It happened before. \"Listen, I'm just here for Kim Namjoon -\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Ah, Namjoon has been showing you around?\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNo! Jungkook's mind screamed.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nKim Taehyung sighed and put a hand on Jungkook's shoulder; his hands were large and his fingers were thin and long and covered in rings, nails painted black. \"Do you know who Kim Namjoon answers to, intern?\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook would answer, but the guy was leaning close and he was very pretty and tall and intimidating, and his high cheekbones had a little glitter on them. He smelled exactly like the sweet gum he was chewing, and it was distracting the way his tongue would occasionally peek out to lick sugar off his lips. Jungkook\u2019s own mouth was a little dry as he opened it to reply.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"You?\" he guessed, voice almost failing him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nKim Taehyung looked pleased, a fake smile sliding onto his face. \"That's right, intern. So why don't you leave those sandwiches on the table, pull the sleeves of your horrid sweater up and come help me?\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt wasn't like Jungkook wanted to, because Kim Taehyung was wrong and Jeonggguk had already tried telling him that. He would like to say he just didn\u2019t say anything because he could exploit this opinionated, well-dressed asshole, but Jungkook was honestly just too flustered to say anything. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, he did what Kim Taehyung told him to.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Okay, intern,\" Taehyung said, clapping his hands together. \"I need you to carry some heavy boxes for me. They're going to the fashion department after the shoot, so I want all of them moved to the main studio entrance. A trolley is coming to pick everything up after the shoot, but it\u2019ll be easier to pick them up from there.\u201d He pointed at a large stack of cardboard boxes in the corner of the room. \"Every box with fashion printed on them. I'm sure you can read that word, even if your own sense of fashion is questionable.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook was a little offended, but he also owned primarily white shirts, so a part of him definitely agreed. \"Alright,\" he said, as if he really was an intern.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"They're quite heavy, be mindful of your back,\" Taehyung voiced, blowing another bubble, and while it was words of kindness he sounded very nonchalant saying them. Like he just didn't want to be responsible if Jungkook did injure something.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"It's okay,\" Jungkook said, \"I'm quite strong.\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung's eyes seemed to inspect him again, and then he huffed a right, whatever, and told Jungkook to be responsive. And do his fucking job.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nObviously, it wasn't Jungkook's job, but Kim Taehyung did turn around and walk away, so Jungkook could technically leave this post and find Kim Namjoon, whoever that was. Jungkook was starting to doubt he was going to get his money by the end of the day, because this set seemed extremely busy and no one looked particularly approachable.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook reckoned he would have more luck when things had calmed down, and so he took a deep breath and lifted one of the boxes.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHonestly, it wasn't exactly difficult work. It was just lifting kind-of heavy cardboard-boxes labeled 'fashion' and putting them down by the exit (gently, because Jungkook didn't know what was in them). It wasn't until Jungkook had placed the final box down by the entrance that someone finally approached him, deep furrow between his brows; the commotion by the cameras seemed to have died down a little behind them, Jungkook noticed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"You're not the intern,\" the guy said. He was dressed in a slim, navy suit and his haircut looked more expensive than everything Jungkook owned. \"Taehyung-ssi said he set my intern to work but the intern isn't arriving until tomorrow.\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook smiled sheepishly. \"Uh, well, Kim Taehyung was very convinced I worked here, for some reason.\" He brushed some imaginary dust off his sweater. \"I'm just the delivery guy. I got your sandwiches here in time, but then the he set me to work.\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Jesus fucking Christ,\" the guy sighed, palming his face in his hands. \"I'm so sorry. I ordered those sandwiches, I'm very sorry to have delayed you. I'll pay you for your hard work here as well, I'm very sorry.\"\u00a0He said sorry so many times Jungkook almost felt bad, even if he was the victim in this situation. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"It's okay. I was too flustered to say much, I was at fault too,\" Jungkook said quickly, before he could apologize again. \"Pay by cash or card?\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Cash,\" the guy Jungkook supposed was Kim Namjoon said, hurriedly pulling a wallet out of his inner pocket. He handed Jungkook a wad of 50 000 won bills, and Jungkook tried his best to mask his expression. \"Again, I'm very sorry. This should hopefully compensate for your troubles.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook took the offered money without question, because honestly who was he to decline. He had done what Kim Taehyung asked him, and whether he was employed here or not he should get paid for the work he had done. \u201cIt\u2019s more than enough,\u201d Jungkook offered a small smile as he shoved the money into his bag, \u201cthank you for using Muscle Pig Delivery Service.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, uh - sorry, once again.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. I was free anyway. Then - I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, of course - don't let me keep you any longer.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nBowing slightly to Namjoon, Jungkook mumbled a formal goodbye and went towards the exit of the studio. On his way, he caught the gaze of Kim Taehyung, and Jungkook might have sent him a small, too-forced smile and wave before walking outside. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nOn Thursdays and Fridays, Muscle Bunny Delivery Service was not, well, in service, because those days Jungkook worked as a receptionist for his cousin\u2019s small tattoo studio in Insa-dong. Jimin didn\u2019t have many employees, but Jungkook was one of them, though with his relatively profitable delivery service Jimin wouldn\u2019t let him work more than two days a week. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSomething about raising him to be independent, or whatever. \n\n\u00a0\n\nNot that Jimin actually raised Jungkook or anything. Jimin was too busy with grades and cram school for most of his life for them to even hang out much, and Jungkook only realized why when Jimin suddenly moved to Seoul and opened his own tattoo studio. His cousin hadn\u2019t seemed like the type who wanted to be a tattoo artist, but Jungkook remembered Jimin had always been a pretty decent artist, and one of the things they used to do together when they were younger was draw. The fact that Jimin had actually gone through with his parents\u2019 wishes for such a long time only so that they would send him to Seoul by himself without question was positively genius.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Jungkook decided he didn\u2019t want to stay in Busan after high school, Jimin welcomed him with open arms to the hustle and bustle of Seoul, even when Jungkook said he didn\u2019t want to go to university. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook had never been very good at school. He wasn\u2019t fond of studying, and neither was he particularly good at it, but Jimin had always said there was nothing he couldn\u2019t do. So, well, academics wasn\u2019t Jungkook\u2019s greatest strength, but he was good at adapting. He was good at just throwing himself into things, good at manual labour, good at fixing things. Muscle Pig Delivery Service had started with him just doing odd jobs\u00a0around their neighborhood, helping old people change their lightbulbs, go get their groceries and drive them places for some quick cash. It was only one year ago he made an actual business out of it, with the help of Jimin and his second-in-command, Heeyeon. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOf course, Jungkook knew just having a service that said \u201cI\u2019ll help you with anything,\u201d was highly dubious, so he decided a delivery service was the best way to market himself. You could still book him for other stuff, but then it was a more detailed process than just \u2018go there, pick this up, deliver here\u2019. He got some very odd jobs now and then, like that time he had dressed up as a mascot for a children\u2019s birthday, and another time he was hired to babysit a teenager only a few years younger than himself. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMoney is money. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook did have an assistant of sorts; a girl named Jiwoo, who usually took care of and declined the weirder requests they got (no, the teenager-sitting\u00a0job was not the oddest thing Jungkook had been asked to do) and she also managed their online finances. She was only in her first year of university and juggled the work with a demanding schedule in school, and Jungkook always appreciated her help, even if they hardly actually saw each other. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJiwoo was another reason why Jungkook agreed to have some days off every week, so that his only employee could actually get her education. As much as Jungkook disliked school, he wasn\u2019t going to get in the way of Jiwoo doing well. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWorking at Jimin\u2019s tattoo studio was pretty easy work anyway. Jungkook only handled the incoming calls and made sure to send arriving customers in the direction of either Jimin or Heeyeon. In Jimin\u2019s words, his job was just to \u2018greet people and look pretty\u2019. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo I have any more appointments today?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJimin had just sent his customer out the door, reminding the quite young girl to keep her shoulder wrapped. Jungkook checked the planner on the computer and shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re all free,\u201d Jungkook said, returning to the game he\u2019d been playing on his phone. He was ten thousand points away from a new high score in anipang. \u201cHeeyeon-noona is done, too, she\u2019s cleaning up her station.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nHis cousin hummed. \u201cLet\u2019s order some food and eat here, then. You hungry?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cStarving,\u201d Jungkook groaned. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHeeyeon!\u201d Jimin called. \u201cWe\u2019re getting food!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nHeeyeon exited her room, bunch of take-out pamphlets already in her hands. When Jungkook first met her he had been extremely intimidated; her whole demeanor screamed I\u2019m in charge, and Jungkook would never dare go against her. She had a large array of colorful, pretty tattoos on her thighs and shoulders and always wore dark lipstick and long, fake nails. For a long time Jungkook wondered how Jimin had managed to befriend someone as cool as her. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJimin was probably the nicest person Jungkook knew, and while Jungkook always made fun of his cousin he also respected him a lot. It was a shame that people judged Jimin so harshly when meeting him, because behind the intricate patterns of ink on his upper body and arms, his cousin was a ray of sunshine. Sometimes Jungkook wondered if they were even related, because Jimin was outgoing and patient and Jungkook was certainly not. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShould we just get pizza?\u201d Heeyeon asked, throwing the pamphlets onto the front desk. She pulled her green\u00a0hair into a small, low ponytail. \u201cI\u2019ve been craving.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nWith no complaints, they ended up ordering a meal deal from the nearest Mr. Pizza, getting enough for them to be fully satisfied when they each went back to their own respective apartments later. Jungkook used to live with Jimin up until a few months ago, but after saving up enough money with a steady income of delivery money Jungkook had found himself a small two-room apartment. It was still in the same neighborhood as Jimin\u2019s place, but it felt better having a place for himself, no matter how shitty the apartment was. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Heeyeon said as they were seated on the sofa area with two large gold crust pizzas in front of them, \u201chow\u2019s the business, Guk?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook nodded through a mouthful that was mostly cheese and strips of tender beef. \u201cPretty good,\u201d he uttered, trying his best not to spit his food into Very Intimidating Girl Heeyeon\u2019s face. \u201cJiwoo\u2019s filtering out the bad requests, so business is a lot more effective now than I used to be on my own. Though yesterday was weird.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJimin lifted one eyebrow. If it was one thing Jungkook knew, it was that Jimin loved hearing about Jungkook doing odd jobs. He had nearly pissed himself laughing when Jungkook told him about the time he was hired as a magician for some kid\u2019s party despite not knowing how to do magic tricks. \u201cSo what happened this time?\u201d he asked, smile already crawling onto his face. \n\n\u00a0\n\nShaking his head lightly, an image of Kim Taehyung popped up in the back of Jungkook\u2019s head. Weird. \u201cI mean, the job in itself wasn\u2019t anything special,\u201d he started, licking some bbq-sauce from his fingers, \u201cjust a regular food delivery. But it was for this high fashion magazine photo shoot or something, and one of the people working there thought I was an intern. And I was an idiot and wasn\u2019t able to say anything about it, so I just - I just ended up doing what he told me to do?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nHeeyeon and Jimin both squinted at him. \u201cSorry, what?\u201d Jimin voiced. \u201cYou just - did it? Why didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Jungkook said, feeling a blush rise to his cheeks. \u201cI was just very flustered, and the guy was - uh - he didn\u2019t seem like he would take no for an answer, anyway, so I just -\u201d He paused, suddenly feeling like something was stuck in his throat. Maybe it was his dignity. \u201cI got paid for it,\u201d he finally mumbled, as an excuse.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a pushover,\u201d Heeyeon snorted, \u201ca big, muscular pushover.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJimin, for a short second, looked concerned. \u201cYou said you got paid for it, right?\u201d he voiced. \u201cThen that\u2019s good. But that was kind of\u2026\u201d Jimin snorted, and shook his head. \u201cWow, Jeonggukie.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nWith a grimace, Jungkook took a big bite of his slice of pizza and tried to stare anywhere but Heeyeon and Jimin. \u201cWhatever. It was a weird job, but I got paid for it. It\u2019s not that big of a deal, it\u2019s just - I hope they don\u2019t call us again, you know? Is that stupid of me to say?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid they pay a lot?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\u2026 yeah?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nHeeyeon nodded. \u201cThen it\u2019s stupid.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook woke up at the crack of dawn the following Monday with his cell phone blaring out the newest Red Velvet track. He groaned, picked up his phone, and managed to read Jiwoo's name on his screen through the morning grogginess. With a sigh - because Jiwoo calling meant it was a job - Jungkook rolled out of bed and put the phone on speaker as he started stretching his sore limbs. He might have overdone himself at the gym yesterday.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Yeah? What you got for me Jiwoo?\" \n\n\u00a0\n\nJiwoo hummed, sounding sleepy as well. \"Coffee delivery. Same place as the veggie sandwiches from last Wednesday.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook paused mid-action of pulling on his cleanest pair of pants and stared at his phone. As if expecting Jiwoo to say just kidding. \"Again?\" he questioned when she didn't pull it off as a prank immediately. Not that she did prank him often with fake calls for for jobs (she had never - Jeon Jiwoo was very professional), but Jungkook had shared with her the odd experience he had at Bangtan Magazine last Friday, so she knew he wouldn't be all too pumped on going back there. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Yep,\" Jiwoo confirmed. \"They're paying well again. It's not the same guy ordering this time, though, this time it's a...\" she paused to find the customer's name in their orders, but for some reason Jungkook could already guess\u00a0who had asked for an early morning delivery, \"... Kim Taehyung.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nGreat. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWell, Jungkook was never one to say no to a well-paying job, even if he had to go through a probably very awkward conversation to get that money. He could manage. Jungkook had been in far more awkward situations than this before, he was sure. He just couldn't remember them at the top of his head. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTeenager-sitting. Teenager-sitting\u00a0was worse than this, right? \n\n\u00a0\n\nYeah, definitely. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Okay, I'll get it done as soon as possible.\" Jungkook stared at the small, digital clock on his wall and frowned. 6:30. Fucking hell. \"Where do they want me to pick the coffee up from?\" \n\n\u00a0\n\nJiwoo repeated the address of a Twosome Palace quite close to the office building, and said she would text it to him as well. \"The order should be under Kim Taehyung's name, they\u2019ll start it up for you when you get there\" Jiwoo finished. \"You don't have any more appointments until 4 after this, so just finish this quickly and you can go back to sleep.\" \n\n\u00a0\n\nShe knew him too well. \"Thanks. I'll be going.\" \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Good luck.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook placed his hands on his hips and stared at the pile of have-used-but-is-still-usable clothes lying on his office chair. He spotted the brand name sweater he had been wearing last time and wrinkled his nose. Why do I even bother, Jungkook thought as he went to his closet to find a clean, casual long-sleeved shirt. It was nice enough that Kim Taehyung wouldn't burn it, hopefully. He slipped quickly into the bathroom, freshened up a little - he could take a shower later, whatever - and tripped out of his bedroom. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, hey.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook had almost forgotten he\u2019d let Jimin crash on his couch. His cousin had been out clubbing last night with Heeyeon, and Heeyeon had accidentally taken Jimin\u2019s stuff with her when she went back home, including his cellphone and the keys to his apartment. Jimin had knocked on Jungkook\u2019s door at three AM after what he described as \u201cthe best lay ever\u201d and promptly fell asleep in the middle of Jungkook\u2019s living room. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not awake enough for you to be speaking to me,\u201d Jimin mumbled, rubbing his eyes. He still had smudges of eyeliner on his face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Jungkook grinned, sheepishly. \u201cForgot you were here.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRude.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook walked over and ruffled Jimin\u2019s hair. \u201cMake yourself something to eat before leaving, hyung. I went grocery shopping the other day, so there should still be edible stuff in the fridge.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMhm,\u201d Jimin mumbled, \u201cthanks, Guk. You\u2019re the best, sometimes.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh fuck you.\u201d Jungkook flicked his forehead at that. \u201cWhatever, I\u2019m leaving. Go back to dreaming about whatever hot chick you were banging last night. If you\u2019re still here when I come back I\u2019ll cook something.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nGrabbing his leather jacket and helmet from the hallway closet, Jungkook took a wistful look at the clock before slipping on his Timberlands and leaving the apartment. \u201cBye hyung!\u201d he yelled, shutting the door and jogging towards the stairwell. His motorcycle was parked at the bottom floor, in the garage of the apartment complex, next to his neighbor\u2019s old-as-balls Ford. Jungkook checked the time again before turning the engine on; he had only used a few minutes getting ready, which was good. Muscle Pig Delivery Service prided itself on being timely. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe traffic was pretty bad, but Jungkook still made it to the Twosome Palace to pick up Kim Taehyung's coffee order - one vanilla soy latte; one - within twenty minutes. The ride to the now slightly familiar business building was a very short one, and Jungkook was pretty certain Taehyung could easily have walked over in his designer heels to get his own damn coffee. He couldn't believe Kim Taehyung had made him wake up at the ass-crack of dawn for one coffee. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThere were significantly less people there this morning, and Jungkook found himself walking towards the lobby receptionist - it was the same lady, of course - to ask for Kim Taehyung. \"Hello,\" he uttered, smiling awkwardly look of recognition flashed over the receptionist's face. \"I'm here with a delivery to Kim Taehyung.\" \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe receptionist nodded, slowly, sizing him up and down. \"Aha. Bulletproof Magazine, floor 26. He should be in.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Thanks.\" \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe elevator ride was also a much more quiet and less claustrophobic one. It was only Jungkook and a well-dressed, short, thin man with inky black hair and a sour expression on his pretty face, and they were apparently both going to floor 26. The man looked at Jungkook and narrowed his eyes as the elevator doors closed, taking in his appearance in the numerous mirrors on the walls. \"You don't work for me,\" he stated, and Jungkook wondered if every one of these fashion people just assumed boys dressed like him were interns. \"Who are you?\" \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"I'm just delivering coffee.\" \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe man looked at the vanilla latte in Jungkook's hand. \"One coffee?\" he voiced. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Yes. One coffee for Kim Taehyung,\" Jungkook said, and honestly he couldn't help but sound immensely bitter about it. Jungkook treasured his sleep, damn it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe guy snorted. \"Ah. Taehyung. That makes sense.\" \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook eyed the numbers of the floors slowly rising. This was taking too long. \"Does he usually send people who doesn't work here out for random coffee runs?\" \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"No, he's supposed to have an assistant for that,\" the guy answered. \"I might be Taehyung's boss, technically, but I can't do much about who he sends for his coffee. I'm afraid he doesn't listen to me, either.\" Oh, so this was the guy who was actually in charge, then. \"How does he even know you?\" \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook wasn\u2019t even sure why this guy wanted to know. \u201dSomeone else hired me last Friday - Kim Namjoon?\" the man grunted to show that he knew who Jungkook was talking about. \"And then I showed up and Taehyung thought I was the new intern, so he made me move all this shit that was going back after your photo shoot or whatever, and I was a little too flustered to say no. So. Yeah. But I do actually do deliveries, I just don't - I usually don't end up in situations like those.\" \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe guy - Kim Taehyung's boss - clicked his tongue. \"Understandable. Kim Taehyung is pretty difficult to say against, isn't he?\" \n\n\u00a0\n\n Tell me about it.  \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe elevator finally dinged, and Jungkook stepped outside after the other man. For someone so short, the guy had an impressive aura. \u201dI\u2019ll show you Taehyung's office, if you'd like,\" he said, motioning for Jungkook to follow him in a nonchalant manner; Jungkook was in unfamiliar territory here, so who was he to decline? Bangtan Magazine HQ had a reception of its own, tall roofs and large fashion spreads blown up on the walls. Jungkook tried not to bump into too much of the minimalistic furniture as he followed the guy through the lit-up halls, attracting stares from several well-dressed people as he passed them. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Here,\" the boss-guy voiced as they stopped in front of a door so suddenly Jungkook nearly faltered. He didn't, though, that's what's important. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Thank you,\" Jungkook said, bowing his head. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"No problem. Don't let him bully you,\u201d the guy smirked, and then he paced off, leaving Jungkook standing in front of Kim Taehyung's office door.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook cleared his throat rather nervously and turned to knock on the door, only to have it suddenly open on him. He managed to step back before the door hit him in the face, but then Kim Taehyung ran straight into him, and honestly Jungkook should have seen it coming. This morning was obviously doomed the moment he realized he had to go back here on Kim Taehyung\u2019s orders. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung\u2019s body collided with his, and Jungkook caught a whiff of sweet-smelling bubblegum before disaster struck.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe still-hot coffee - as fate had it - decided to spill all over Jungkook\u2019s shirt, seeping through the material effectively. Jungkook hissed out a timely \u2018motherfucker\u2019 just as Kim Taehyung finally seemed to realize the situation. He stared down at Jungkook - those designer heels gave him an unfair advantage - frown slowly etching onto his face. Not a single drop of the drink had made it onto Taehyung\u2019s navy blue designer suit.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs that my coffee on your shirt?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook usually wasn\u2019t good at talking back, but at this point he was tired and angry and his chest was burning. \u201cOh whose fucking fault is that?\u201d he growled out. It was unlike himself, because Jungkook was never rude to customers. Not really. He might come off as uninterested and detached, but Jungkook was never deliberately rude. \u201cFuck this,\u201d Jungkook voiced, examining the shirt closely, \u201cwhy the fuck did I even come here.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m paying you to bring me coffee, duh,\u201d Kim Taehyung scoffed. \u201cAnd I guess you have to go get me another one, now, since this one spilled. And I\u2019m cutting down the payment, since it\u2019s taking too long.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook couldn't help it when his jaw dropped. Was this guy serious? \u201cYou\u2019re fucking joking, right?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be joking?\u201d Jungkook was pretty sure he had never met a more pretentious asshole in his life. \u201cI\u2019m just - I\u2019m just going to leave, and I won\u2019t take your stupid fucking money, and then you can just never contact my delivery service again, how is that?\u201d Jungkook pressed the now-empty cup into Taehyung\u2019s chest. \u201cHere. I\u2019m sure you can lick some of that stupid-ass vanilla soy latte out of the cup, if you try hard enough. If not,\u201d he pointed to his chest, \u201cthere is more than enough here, because you ran straight into me causing it to spill.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nKim Taehyung actually looked surprised at that, eyes dropping to the stain on Jungkook\u2019s shirt. \u201cWhat\u2026 what exactly are you offering here, delivery boy? For me to lick your chest?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nOh, fuck. Fuck, that wasn\u2019t at all what Jungkook meant. He was just pissed, and when he got pissed he tended to say a lot of stupid shit. \u201cI - \u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShaking his head, Taehyung held the door to his office open and motioned for Jungkook to go inside with a jerk of his head. \u201cGet in, delivery boy.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI did not mean -\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGet. In.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nMumbling under his breath, Jungkook did as he was told - fucking idiot as he was; he should have just walked away - and Taehyung slammed the door shut after them both. Jungkook cleared his throat awkwardly as Kim Taehyung took long strides around him, to a rack of clothes standing behind his impressive desk. His office was huge, with large fashion spreads on the wall, a small seating area in one corner, and multiple clothing items hanging around and filling up the half-empty shelves on the wall. Jungkook noticed a whole shelf of glass-jars filled with bubblegum.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cStrip,\u201d Taehyung said suddenly, effectively stopping Jungkook from examining the interior of the office. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook spluttered. \u201cExcuse me?!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung lifted one eyebrow, but for one second Jungkook thought he saw his cheeks flush. Probably the lighting. \u201cYour shirt, delivery boy. I\u2019m going to give you something to change into, and then you\u2019ll go get my coffee and we\u2019ll settle this business deal like adults. How\u2019s that?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nWow, okay. \n\n\u00a0\n\nFucking asshole. \n\n\u00a0\n\nGrumbling, Jungkook moved to lift his shirt over his head, because honestly it was growing uncomfortable to wear coffee-stained fabric. He had a feeling borrowing anything from Kim Taehyung would have consequences, but once again Jungkook was just agreeing to whatever Taehyung told him to do. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung cleared his throat to get Jungkook\u2019s attention, and no, the lighting was not fucking with him; Taehyung\u2019s ears were bright red, and Jungkook was not imagining it. His eyes flickered between the tattoos on Jungkook\u2019s arm and on his chest, and Jungkook wondered if it was possible to maybe just sink into the floor. Yeah, no, this was definitely a very awkward experience, and he wasn\u2019t entirely sure how to feel about Kim Taehyung quite obviously checking him out. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cS-shirt?\u201d Jungkook voiced, weakly. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHm? Oh, yeah.\u201d Taehyung pulled a piece of clothing - it looked innocent enough - from the rack, and walked over to Jungkook with it. He held it up to Jungkook\u2019s chest, seemingly measuring it. \u201cThis should do. It\u2019s last season, but I\u2019m sure the likes of you don\u2019t really mind?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook was sure that was an insult, but he couldn\u2019t find himself to care. The shirt was nice enough - white with some blue patterns on it - and while it wasn\u2019t anything Jungkook would normally wear it was better than something coffee-stained. As Taehyung handed him the shirt, he hastily pulled it on, because honestly he didn\u2019t want to stand shirtless in Taehyung\u2019s office one second longer. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, Taehyung-ssi -\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nOf course, just as Jungkook was shrugging on the shirt, the door to Taehyung\u2019s office opened and someone stepped inside. He had orange hair brighter than Jimin\u2019s personality and tanned skin and he looked more than just a little surprised to see that Kim Taehyung had company in his office. Jungkook wasn\u2019t stupid - the second he saw the stranger\u2019s eyes widen, he realized how this might look, and he hurriedly buttoned the rest of the shirt with his cheeks on fire. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid you want anything, Hoseok?\u201d Taehyung asked. \u201cI\u2019m a little busy.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nNo. No, stop, you\u2019re making it worse. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI - I can see that,\u201d the guy named Hoseok uttered, staring between Taehyung and Jungkook with what seemed to be genuine curiosity. \u201cI\u2019m just here to remind you that you have a meeting in thirty minutes, and you should finish whatever\u2026 business you have until then.\u201d He smiled, in a way that said I have just witnessed something brilliant, and then he was out the door as fast as he appeared. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook wondered if Kim Taehyung was daft and just hadn\u2019t been able to read the situation, and he was about to ask why the hell he hadn\u2019t said anything but then Taehyung\u2019s hands were on his collar and he was so close. It was like Jungkook had forgotten just how pretty Kim Taehyung was up close just from last Wednesday and was seeing him again for the first time. He had such gorgeous tanned skin and glittering cheeks and long eyelashes and nice lips, and it hit Jungkook all at once and left him just a little breathless. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere, now you look presentable enough, I suppose,\u201d Taehyung voiced, and he was still a in Jungkook\u2019s space and he smelled of bubblegum and his voice was smooth and deep and had a very obvious, forced Seoul dialect. Taehyung\u2019s eyes sparkled, and for a very, very short moment it looked like he smiled. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUhm,\u201d Jungkook stuttered, like an idiot. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung lifted one eyebrow at Jungkook\u2019s response and finally stepped away. \u201cWhy are you just standing there like an idiot?\u201d he snapped, voice suddenly harsh again. \u201cGo get my coffee.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd like that the moment was shattered, because honestly no matter how gorgeous Kim Taehyung was it couldn\u2019t mask the fact that he was a fucking bitch. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Jungkook was once again woken up by Jiwoo\u2019s phone call at 6:30 AM. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLet me guess,\u201d he groaned into the phone, \u201cKim Taehyung?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nGreat. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe fourth time Jungkook pressed the button to floor 26 to deliver Kim Taehyung his daily coffee he started wondering whether he was slowly accepting that this was just supposed to become routine. It was stupid, because after the first coffee delivery nothing really happened. Jungkook just delivered the usual vanilla soy latte, got his money, and then he was on his merry way. Taehyung didn\u2019t hold him back or try to make him to intern work, and after getting the borrowed shirt back there was absolutely no reason for Jungkook to return to Bangtan Magazine. Yet, here he was, in the elevator on the way up to Kim Taehyung\u2019s office, again. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting used to seeing you.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook shared a short, acknowledging smile with Taehyung\u2019s boss - he had introduced himself as Min Yoongi - and held up the cup of coffee. \u201cYeah. I guess this is an everyday job now.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nYoongi chucked. \u201cTaehyung is insufferable, but as long as you are getting paid I\u2019m sure you can manage.\u201d It was true. Taehyung paid him good money for just picking up coffee, which was one of the reasons why Jungkook still agreed to doing this. It was easy money. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you on Thursday though. Or Friday?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNot working, then,\u201d Jungkook said, because Yoongi was quite pleasant to hold conversations with compared to certain other people. \u201cI have part time at my cousin\u2019s tattoo parlor those days, but I\u2019m in service on Saturdays. Sunday\u2019s my only day off.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re busy, then,\u201d Yoongi said, nodding his head slowly. \u201cYou don\u2019t go to school? You look like you could be in college.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nAh. College. \u201cSchool isn\u2019t really for me,\u201d Jungkook said simply, because that was the truth. Usually people didn\u2019t understand, because what could you do without college nowadays? \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d The silence was a little defeating as the elevator came to stop on their floor and the doors dinged open. As usual, Jungkook let Min Yoongi out first. \u201cWell, I suppose I might see you tomorrow, then, Jungkook-ssi. Please tell Taehyung to stop terrorizing you and rather find himself a new assistant?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nBefore Jungkook had the time to answer or even ask why Taehyung didn\u2019t have an assistant, Min Yoongi was gone, fretting down the hall to the right. Jungkook frowned, passing by the reception to get to Taehyung\u2019s office. The receptionist - Jungkook didn\u2019t know her name, but she was pretty and seemed nice - looked up from where she was filing her nails and offered Jungkook a good morning. Her quirk of her lips was just a little mysterious, but Jungkook tried not to think too much of it. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust here to deliver Kim Taehyung his coffee,\u201d Jungkook said, just in case. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMhm,\u201d the receptionist nodded, odd smile never leaving her lips. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat the fuck, Jungkook thought, looking over his shoulder as he ventured down the brightly-lit hallway. The road to Taehyung\u2019s office was familiar now, and since Taehyung didn\u2019t seem to want anything but coffee nowadays, Jungkook could manage. There had been no accidents and no Taehyung pushing him around to do odd jobs, so Jungkook could always leave as soon as he got his money. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe knocked on Taehyung\u2019s office door - the plaque read Kim Taehyung, fashion editor in both hangul and english - and let himself in. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCoffee delivery,\u201d he voiced, peeking inside the office. Taehyung was on the phone, barely looking up as Jungkook entered. He motioned for Jungkook to put the coffee on his desk, and so Jungkook closed the door behind him and approached.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, hyung, I\u2019m not going to ditch the launch party,\u201d Taehyung said, his voice strung and mouth set in a deep frown. \u201cWhy would I?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook barely heard the indistinct sound of someone talking on the other end of the line. He felt like he shouldn\u2019t be there, but Taehyung hadn\u2019t paid him yet so he really didn\u2019t have a choice but to stand there awkwardly. Taehyung grabbed his vanilla soy latte and took a small sip of it, humming. \u201cI\u2019m not going to drop out on the launch party just because you were an asshole and gave the chief editor position to Yoongi. I\u2019m not that petty,\u201d Taehyung said, sounding extremely petty. \u201cI\u2019ll come, hyung. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe smile on Taehyung\u2019s face was strained, and his eyes flickered up to Jungkook briefly. \u201cOh. Uh, yeah, sure. I\u2019ll\u2026 think about it. He might be busy.\u201d Taehyung cleared his throat and sat up straighter in his chair. \u201cSee you, hyung. Now hang up, international calls are really expensive, you know.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook watched as Taehyung ended his call, put the phone back on his desk and groaned, resting his head in his hands. Awkwardly clearing his throat, Jungkook shifted the weight on his feet where he stood. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMay I have my money now, Taehyung-ssi?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Taehyung met his gaze, wide-eyed, and Jungkook felt his heart stutter because Taehyung looked so confused, like he had no idea why Jungkook was still there. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy payment, Taehyung-ssi. I have another job to get to, so if you wouldn\u2019t mind\u2026?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh! Oh, right!\u201d Taehyung hurriedly stood up from his seat, heels clicking against the expensive wooden floor as he walked over to the seating area in the corner, picking up a sleek, black bag. \u201cYou have another delivery this early?\u201d Taehyung asked, and Jungkook was very surprised he actually tried making conversation. He hadn\u2019t said many nice things to Jungkook following up to this, so it was\u2026 unexpected. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s\u2026 another sort of job.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung turned and looked at Jungkook over his shoulder. \u201cThat sounds really dubious, delivery boy.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nAt this point Jungkook was pretty sure Taehyung knew his name, but for some reason he kept insistingly calling Jungkook delivery boy. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything weird,\u201d Jungkook said. Not this time, he added in his head. \u201cI was asked to do a self defense class at a girl\u2019s high school, and they\u2019re paying me for it. Simple as that.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you even certified to do that?\u201d Taehyung asked, scoffing. Jungkook wasn\u2019t really, but both he and Jiwoo did martial arts when they were younger, and the school didn\u2019t mind. It was the first job they had agreed to take on as a team in a long while, and Jungkook was looking forward to it. \u201cI was not aware that\u2019s how your business worked.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t read everything on our webpage, then,\u201d Jungkook said. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung pursed his lips as he walked over to Jungkook, Jungkook\u2019s payment in his hand. \u201cI suppose I didn\u2019t,\u201d Taehyung said. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to read it thoroughly until next time. I\u2019m sure it explains why you aren\u2019t in service on Thursdays and Fridays, too?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI have a part time job,\u201d Jungkook uttered, voice faltering now that Taehyung was standing close to him. He always tried to talk in a stable, nonchalant manner to make himself appear more confident, but whenever Kim Taehyung got into his personal space Jungkook became a stuttering mess. Jungkook hated how effected he was, just because Taehyung was attractive and tall and had very pretty eyes. \u201cMy co-worker is quite busy with university, so for her sake I keep the delivery service closed a few days every week.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung lifted his brows, quickly. \u201cHow considerate of you.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know, I\u2019m pretty nice.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTo Jungkook\u2019s surprise, Taehyung chuckled, and for once the smile on his face didn\u2019t look the least bit smug. Oh no, Jungkook thought. Oh no, he can\u2019t have a cute smile that is so unfair. \u201cI guess you are. Well, there is your money -\u201d Jungkook startled as Taehyung promptly shoved the money into the front pocket of his jeans, \u201c- so you are free to go. I\u2019m a very busy person, and it seems you are as well, so let\u2019s not keep each other occupied.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook, still in shock that Taehyung had actually just done that barely managed a nod before turning around to leave the office. \u201cHey, delivery boy?\u201d Taehyung spoke up, and Jungkook turned around again embarrassingly fast. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cY-yes?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung shot him another smile, an adorable box-shaped one, and lifted his coffee cup. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cY-yeah,\u201d Jungkook said, fumbling to open the door, \u201ctomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat the fuck, he thought as he passed by the reception on his way to the elevator with flaming cheeks. What the actual fuck. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMan, that was fun,\u201d Jiwoo voiced, stretching her arms over her head as they exited the premises of the all-girls high school. They had just spent one hour teaching fourteen-year-olds how to throw grown men (read: Jungkook) into the ground, and Jiwoo had been in her element, enthusiastically showing off about thirty different ball-kicking techniques. Jungkook, with a very sore back, groaned at her enthusiasm. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, I could tell you enjoyed yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks for not actually kneeing me in the balls during all that. I could tell you were tempted.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJiwoo patted Jungkook\u2019s hurting shoulder. \u201cI do technically work for you, Jungkook, so I wasn\u2019t going to hurt you too much. I\u2019ll buy you some lunch as compensation for throwing you to the ground?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI accept.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey left Jungkook\u2019s bike on the school\u2019s parking lot - Jiwoo didn\u2019t drive, but Jungkook had promised to give her a lift back home - and started scouting the nearby area for a decent restaurant. They found one without much difficulty, the old waitress ushering them in and taking their orders even before they had time to sit down. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook counted through the money the school\u2019s principal had given them, pulling out Jiwoo\u2019s share and handing it to her immediately. Usually Jungkook got most of the payment, since he was the one actually doing the job, but this time they split it 50/50. Jiwoo, already on her phone, barely looked up to accept the money. \u201cOh, thanks,\u201d she voiced, and Jungkook choked on nothing as she simply stuffed the money into her bra. \u201cI saw I\u2019d gotten a few e-mails during the self defense class, so -\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nShe paused, her brows furrowing deeply at whatever she was reading on her screen. \u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d she voiced, looking up from her screen, \u201cwhat the fuck.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jungkook asked. \u201cIs it a weird request?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s weird alright,\u201d Jiwoo confirmed. She continued scrolling down her phone, eyes widening more and more the further she read. \u201cIt\u2019s really weird.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook frowned, leaning over the table. \u201cThen just reject it?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI mean -\u201d Jiwoo hesitated, \u201c- it\u2019s from that guy at Bangtan Magazine, Kim Taehyung -\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook hated how he could already feel his face heating up, but he tried to fake a grim expression at the mention of Taehyung\u2019s name. \u201cW-what about him? What does he want?\u201d Jungkook asked, and Jiwoo grimaced before handing him her phone. Jungkook scrolled to the top of the e-mail and started reading. \n\n\u00a0\n\nFrom: Kim Taehyung ([email\u00a0protected])\n\n\nSubject: Job Request\n\n\u00a0\n\n Hello.  \n\n\u00a0\n\n This is a formal request for Muscle Pig Delivery Service to help me with a simple, one-evening task. I might have gotten myself in sort of a\u2026 situation, and I am in need of a date for a launch party three weeks from now. As I have used your services before I am sure you know who I am asking for; I\u2019m willing to pay a large sum for Jeon Jungkook\u2019s company thorough the night, and for him to pretend we have been dating for a while.  \n\n\u00a0\n\n I will request for him to join me on a few occasions to take pictures and make it a little believable, but I will pay you extra for the trouble. I am not sure how much is appropriate payment for this sort of job, so please contact me on that notion. If you agree to the job I am willing to discuss details. \n\n\u00a0\n\n Best wishes, \n\n\n Kim Taehyung \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook almost dropped Jiwoo\u2019s phone after reading the e-mail, staring up at his co-worker with wide eyes. The old waitress came over with their food but Jungkook couldn\u2019t even focus on how delicious it looked, because what the hell. When he told Taehyung about his business and how it wasn\u2019t just a delivery service this morning he hadn\u2019t expected Taehyung to actually take use of that information. Was this why he had been acting weirdly nice? \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is on you, Jungkook,\u201d Jiwoo said, pulling a bowl of kimchi stew closer to her. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a weird-ass request, but you\u2019ve done some pretty bizarre shit for money, so this might not be that bad? Anyway, I\u2019m putting the decision on your shoulders, since you\u2019re the one that has to do this shit.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook should say no, because Kim Taehyung was pretty and intimidating but also a complete bitch, and now that Taehyung wasn\u2019t even here, enthralling Jungkook with his looks, he should be able to. He should be able to tell Jiwoo to reject the offer. He could honestly just tell Jiwoo to reject all of Taehyung\u2019s offers, because Jungkook was his own boss, damn it, but for some reason he felt like he would lose. He would not only lose a customer, but he would lose whatever game Taehyung was playing by constantly hiring Jungkook just to get him his fucking coffee. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDetermined to find out just what Taehyung wanted from him - because this couldn\u2019t possibly have been Taehyung\u2019s plan to begin with - Jungkook gave the phone back to Jiwoo and said, \u201caccept it.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJiwoo paused in the action of taking a spoonful of soup, staring at Jungkook. \u201cAre you for real?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook nodded, already knowing he was going to regret this. \u201cYeah. If it\u2019s Kim Taehyung we can be sure to milk a lot of money out of it, so I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be worth it. I\u2019ll ask him about it tomorrow. When I deliver his coffee.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh. Right. Yeah, he already put in the order for you to come by tomorrow, I forgot to tell you.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nFor a second, Taehyung\u2019s grin when he had said see you tomorrow flashed in front of Jungkook\u2019s eyes, and he could feel himself flushing for absolutely no reason. \u201cHm. Though so,\u201d he mumbled, hiding his reddening face in the steam of the boiling hot soup in front of him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was so going to regret this.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nscream to me on tumblr\n\n\n\u201cGood morning, Jungkook-ssi,\u201d Yoongi greeted as they met inside the elevators. Jungkook felt like shit, having spent the whole night thinking too much - thinking too much about Kim Taehyung at that - but he still managed a polite smile in Yoongi\u2019s direction. \u201cI see you\u2019ve brought two coffees today?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook took a look at the coffees in his hand. He\u2019d bought a simple iced americano for himself together with Taehyung\u2019s usual order, knowing they might have to talk over the new\u2026 job for a while. Jungkook was already regretting it, the closer he got to Taehyung\u2019s office, but every time he got a little too comfortable with the idea of bailing he reminded himself of the money. Money. And of course, figuring out just what the fuck was going on inside Kim Taehyung\u2019s head. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, I was thirsty,\u201d Jungkook said in excuse, letting Yoongi walk out of the elevator first as soon as it stopped on the floor of Bangtan Magazine. He greeted the receptionist, said a small goodbye to Yoongi as he walked down to the right, and went on his way to Taehyung\u2019s office. The walk there was just a little too short, but Jungkook hadn\u2019t spent the whole evening writing down every question he had for Taehyung to back out now. It might sound really stupid, but Jungkook was slowly coming to terms with how affected he was by Kim Taehyung. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe shortly knocked on Taehyung\u2019s door, not even waiting for him to reply before entering. Taehyung wasn\u2019t on the phone this time, but he was tapping furiously on the keyboard of his computer, deep furrow between his brows. \u201cOh. Delivery boy.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook nearly rolled his eyes as he closed the door behind him. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he said, placing Taehyung\u2019s coffee on his desk. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Taehyung answered, grabbing his coffee immediately. He pointed towards a chair sitting by the wall; it was simple and looked very uncomfortable. \u201cBring that chair, sit down.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook wanted to protest, but he didn\u2019t. He dragged the chair \u2014 deliberately being very loud \u2014 towards Taehyung\u2019s desk and sat down, taking a long sip of his coffee as he met Taehyung\u2019s eyes. Taehyung slowly raised one eyebrow as he brought his own cup to his lips. \u201cSo,\u201d Jungkook said, thinking back to the notes he had jotted down last night. \u201cI have a few questions about that\u2026 job.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung nodded, placing the cup down and folding his arms over his chest; he leaned back in his chair, pushed back a little, and threw one long leg over the other. Jungkook\u2019s eyes dropped to the bright red heels on his feet, and he gulped. Suddenly he forgot everything he had spent the whole night thinking about; everything he was supposed to ask. \u201cUhm,\u201d he started, looking up at Taehyung\u2019s face. He was smiling, now, but it was the sly, smug kind again. \u201cI was just - I was really just wondering why. Why me?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh.\u201d Taehyung tilted his head to the side, and the smile fell off his face just as quick as it had appeared. \u201cI guess it\u2019s kind of my fault, and I\u2019ll do my best to explain. Remember that you already agreed to take the job!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung actually looked a little nervous at that, and Jungkook might have scooted his chair just a little closer to his desk. \u201cYeah. I already took the job, I\u2019m not going to bail on you,\u201d he said, trying to sound a little bit comforting though he had no idea why. \u201cYou\u2019re still paying me for this.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung nodded, pushing a hand through his hair. Even though it was bleached, it looked soft as it fell perfectly over his forehead again. \u201cWell - you remember the first time you came for coffee delivery here? That day we were interrupted?\u201d Jungkook vaguely remembered the man with the bright orange hair bursting into Taehyung\u2019s office, so he nodded. \u201cWell, Jung Hoseok is kind of a gossip, so he might have spread some\u2026 rumors about the two of us. Long story short the entirety of Bangtan Magazine think we are dating.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook was very happy he wasn\u2019t drinking in that exact moment, but he still felt his jaw drop comically. Suddenly the knowing looks the receptionist gave him every morning made sense. \u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d he blurted out, \u201cwhy haven't you - I don\u2019t know - cleared it up?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I specifically said that you were my boyfriend, I just didn\u2019t say anything to reject it either,\u201d Taehyung said, and he looked embarrassed, which Jungkook would have found kind of adorable if he wasn\u2019t a little pissed. \u201cI might have this\u2026 reputation of not being able to have exclusive relationships, and maybe I just wanted people to believe that wasn\u2019t true. I didn\u2019t really think far ahead, since, uh\u2026\u201d Taehyung was actively avoiding Jungkook\u2019s eyes at this point, \u201cmy brother owns the magazine. Well. My family does.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nOh no. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Jungkook voiced. \u201cYour family is going to be -\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Taehyung cut him off, quickly, \u201cthey are. And my brother heard about my supposed boyfriend and wasted no time calling me and having me promise to bring him to his launch party. My parents will be there but - but,\u201d he sat up a little straighter and looked at Jungkook pleadingly, \u201cmy parents live abroad and will only be in Seoul for a short while and my brother travels a lot so he\u2019s never really here either. It\u2019s just a one-time thing, they don\u2019t really need to see you in person more than once. I just need a few pictures as proof that we have been on dates, and then the only time we really have to pretend we are together is during the launch party.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook pinched the bridge of his nose trying to process this information. This was more complicated than just pretending to be Kim Taehyung\u2019s boyfriend for one night, because Taehyung actually needed Jungkook of all people. He couldn\u2019t actually believe Taehyung had willingly let all his co-workers think they were dating. Jungkook was pretty sure he wasn\u2019t as romantic that he would willingly wake up every morning to give his boyfriend coffee. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWell, he had already been doing that for a week, but he was paid for that. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe just have to meet up a few times before the party,\u201d Taehyung continued, and Jungkook noticed how his voice was slowly growing more desperate. \u201cWe\u2019ll take some cute pictures that I can send to my family and stuff, and then during the launch we can act all lovey-dovey and - and then I\u2019ll stop. I\u2019ll stop asking for deliveries, and I\u2019ll never contact you again.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook said, quickly, and maybe that was mean. But Taehyung was weird and made Jungkook feel weird, and if Taehyung promised leaving him alone the moment this was over, that was good. He already agreed to take this job anyway, there was little he could do but agree. Jiwoo had been thrilled at the potential fortune they could make off this job. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh thank God,\u201d Taehyung sighed, and it looked like his entire body just deflated in relief. \u201cGreat, fantastic.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe looked so relieved Jungkook almost felt bad about even considering not doing this. Which was really fucking stupid, because this whole agreement was just bizarre. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhen do you want to start?\u201d Jungkook asked, because the sooner then got this whole thing going the better. Hopefully he would be able to leave soon so he could start to man himself up for the next time he met Taehyung. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Taehyung said, immediately standing up from his seat. Jungkook\u2019s eyes widened, because he hadn\u2019t expected that, and he squeezed his forgotten coffee-cup in his hands. He watched as Taehyung walked over to the glass jars on the shelf behind his desk and took out a bright pink ball of gum and popped it into his mouth. When he walked closer to Jungkook, the sugary smell hit him like a freight train. \u201cFirst, your number,\u201d Taehyung said, pulling his own phone out of the inner pocket of his fancy-looking suit jacket. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook felt like Taehyung was staring a hole into his head as he plotted in his number on Taehyung\u2019s smartphone. Seconds after giving it back to him, Jungkook felt his own phone vibrate in his pocket. \u201cThere we go. Now, I\u2019m still very busy today, but when are you free on Thursday?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUhm - after six?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay. Text me the address to wherever you\u2019re at and I\u2019ll pick you up. Where do you want to go?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook\u2019s mind blanked out for a second. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 know?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung sighed. \u201cOkay, then - we\u2019ll go to the movies. That\u2019s simple enough. Let\u2019s just remember to take a few pictures before the movie starts.\u201d Taehyung put his phone back into his pocket and popped a large bubble with his gum. \u201cI\u2019ll follow you to the elevator.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nYou really don\u2019t need to do that, Jungkook thought, thinking of the looks the receptionist would give them if they came out together, but Taehyung had already walked past him and to the front door. Jungkook scurried out of his seat and followed Taehyung like some pathetic puppy, because what else could he do. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to send me that address,\u201d Taehyung said as they walked down the hallway. Jungkook felt stupidly small walking next to him, and it was more because of the looks they attracted rather than the height difference. A few of Taehyung\u2019s co-workers actively popped their heads out of their offices to look after them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll remember,\u201d Jungkook promised. He dropped his gaze to the floor when he met the eyes of the receptionist and she smiled knowingly at him. \u201cThanks for - following me, I guess.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung nodded. \u201cI can be nice, you know?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook had still to actually see that, honestly, but he tried not to make it so obvious that he didn\u2019t believe Taehyung\u2019s words. \u201cSee you on Thursday, then,\u201d he said, pressing the elevator button. \n\n\u00a0\n\nCocking his head to the side, Taehyung pursed his lips. \u201cWhat makes you think this means you\u2019re exempted from coffee runs, baby?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nOh no. Oh no, abort mission. Jungkook was not prepared for pet names, much less pet names like that, because Taehyung was too close again, sweet-smelling bubblegum clogging up his brain. When did Taehyung think it was a good idea to go from delivery boy to baby. \u201cUh,\u201d Jungkook uttered, brain short-circuiting. \u201cI - uh - s-see you tomorrow?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nAs if the pet name wasn\u2019t enough, Taehyung leaned down and pressed a small, lipgloss-sticky kiss to to Jungkook\u2019s cheek just as the elevator dinged to signalize it\u2019s arrival. Jungkook was pretty sure his whole face was red as he spluttered out a goodbye, and hurriedly made his way into the elevator. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook tapped his fingers against the counter, eyes stuck on the clock on the wall. It was slowly but surely moving towards six o\u2019 clock, and Jungkook wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about knowing that Kim Taehyung would very soon pick him up from his cousin\u2019s tattoo parlor. He tried telling Taehyung - through a series of awkward messages - that it might be better for them to meet at the cinema, but Taehyung insisted on picking Jungkook up after work. Jungkook might also have told Jimin that someone was coming to bring him on a date, and maybe he had left out the part where this was technically a job. It would be easier if the two of them didn\u2019t have to pretend in front of both their families, obviously, but Jungkook imagined he would have\u00a0troubles explaining to Jimin just why he had agreed to take on a job like this. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHell, he had trouble justifying it for himself. \n\n\u00a0\n\nEvery time the bell over the door chimed Jungkook would feel his heart stutter and every time it wasn\u2019t Taehyung he would be just a little bit disappointed. Which was silly, because he shouldn\u2019t exactly expect Taehyung to be early. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAt exactly 6:01 PM however, the door to the tattoo parlor opened, and Jungkook was about to say a practiced \u201cwe\u2019re closed for the evening,\u201d until he saw that it was Taehyung. He was dressed in tight-hugging dark jeans and a silky shirt that looked just a little too big on him. The platform boots on his feet were ridiculously tall and Jungkook wondered if he\u2019d have to invest in shoe-lifts if he was going to be able to walk anywhere in Taehyung\u2019s company without feeling really short. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSuddenly he realized how Jimin felt most of the time. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Taehyung greeted, walking over to the counter. Somehow, without the suit and atmosphere of the workplace he seemed a little more\u2026 approachable. \u201cWasn\u2019t aware you worked at a tattoo parlor.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Jungkook voiced. \u201cThe tattoos didn\u2019t give it away?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung shrugged. \u201cOf course not. Even I have a tattoo.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d Jungkook deadpanned. For a hot moment he imagined intricate ink swirling around Taehyung\u2019s tan skin and then he mentally scolded himself because wow, Jeon Jungkook, way to be creepy. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWish I was,\u201d Taehyung snorted and leaned his body onto the counter. Pop. \u201cNot that tattoos are bad, or whatever, but I got it when I was drunk, in college, and it\u2019s - you know - it\u2019s a tramp stamp.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook lifted his eyebrows far beyond his hairline, and maybe he leaned just a little to the side and eyed Taehyung\u2019s lower back, just to check if he could see a hint of it through the silky shirt, but the material of it wasn\u2019t nearly sheer enough. \u201cReally?\u201d he said, because for some reason Jungkook just couldn\u2019t believe it, \u201cyou have a lower back tattoo?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Taehyung confirmed again, and maybe he sounded a little annoyed. \u201cWhat? Do I need to show you or something for you to believe me?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook spluttered, and he was about to say no, absolutely not, when Jimin emerged from his studio. Taehyung whipped his head around, eyeing Jimin as he sent his customer out the door. The boy looked like he was crying, so Jungkook suspected he\u2019d chickened out on the tattoo he was supposed to be getting. \u201cCome back some other time, Seungcheol-ssi,\u201d Jimin said with a kind smile, and the boy muttered something inaudible as he exited. \u201cI swear,\u201d Jimin sighed, \u201che seemed like he would be able to do it this ti - huh?\u201d Jimin paused at the sight of Taehyung. \u201cWho are you?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nClearing his throat, Jungkook walked out from behind the counter. \u201cUh, this is Taehyung, who\u2019s - uh - taking me out today. Taehyung, this is my cousin, Jimin.\u201d Referring to Taehyung as just Taehyung was weird, but they had kind of agreed to at least speak informally to each other from the very beginning, just so they wouldn\u2019t be awkward about it at the launch party. Through a simple \u2018questionnaire\u2019 over text Jungkook had learned that Taehyung was Jimin\u2019s age - merely two years older than him - and Jungkook hated formal speech anyway. So, yeah, it was odd, but for some reason it felt more comfortable too. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin uttered, eyes widening as he looked Taehyung up and down. \u201cWow. Wow, Jeonggukie, what the fuck did you do to reel in someone like him?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook groaned at his cousin\u2019s words, feeling his cheeks heating up. This was too early in the night for him to be blushing already. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile Taehyung was positively beaming at the compliment, and Jungkook definitely wasn\u2019t ready for Round Two of Kim Taehyung\u2019s Brilliant Smile. It stretched across his whole face and made him look young and carefree and ugh, Jungkook could not deal with that right now. \u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you to say, Jimin-ssi, but Jeonggukie is quite the catch himself, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook said, his voice embarrassingly high-pitched. \u201cLet\u2019s just leave, Taehyung.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSure, baby.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey walked outside the tattoo parlor to the sound of Jimin cackling, but Jungkook could barely hear it with the ringing in his ears. He was just very bad with pet names, and maybe it was because he liked it a little too much, but Taehyung didn\u2019t need to know that. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung\u2019s car was impressive without a doubt; sleek and in a matte black color, but Jungkook didn\u2019t have time to check out the brand before Taehyung ushered him into the passenger seat. The interior was luxurious as well, and Jungkook felt like he shouldn\u2019t even be sitting there. \u201cI got us tickets to the new Marvel movie,\u201d Taehyung said when they were both inside, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you like superheroes, but I do, and I\u2019m paying, so.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nI own Iron Man socks, Jungkook almost said, but he figured that information was not necessary. \u201cMarvel movies are okay. I like superheroes, too.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s good, then,\u201d Taehyung said, and then he rolled out of the small parking space in front of Jimin\u2019s tattoo parlor. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe beginning of the ride to the cinema was smooth and relatively silent, save for Taehyung asking a few questions about Jimin. Jungkook shared that Jimin was his only family in Seoul and that Jimin ran the parlor with a friend his age. \u201cSo you both came from Busan on your own then?\u201d Taehyung asked. \u201cWas it not that long ago that you came here? I mean - you guys don\u2019t speak Seoul dialect.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t care to,\u201d Jungkook said. \u201cI mean, your Seoul dialect sounds really forced, too.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung shot Jungkook a very small look. \u201cDoes it? Shit, I\u2019ve been working on it. They don\u2019t really take you seriously at job meetings with a heavy accent, you know.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook didn\u2019t know, because he had never been in a job where people cared about that. But he supposed the fashion industry was different that doing deliveries in that way; there was more to lose in terms of appearance, more behind it than just covering up your tattoos not to scare off older citizens. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to force it with me,\u201d Jungkook found himself saying. \u201cI mean - I don\u2019t care.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung scoffed. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet of you, but I\u2019m trying to get used to it. I\u2019ll have to put in an effort.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSounds tiring.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Taehyung said. \u201cBut if I want to snatch the chief editor position from Min Yoongi I\u2019ll have to work harder than anyone else.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook thought it sounded weird, because he could have sworn Taehyung said his family owned the magazine. Wasn\u2019t that the main reason how the rumor had spread and why Jungkook was going out on fake dates to collect evidence of him and Taehyung being a thing? \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI thought you said your brother owns Bangtan Magazine?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe does,\u201d Taehyung confirmed. \u201cBut I\u2019m still very young, and just giving me the position would show bias, obviously, since I\u2019m family. Not like I\u2019ve worked for this since forever.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI get it, because Yoongi has technically worked at the Seoul branch longer. I\u2019m just petty about it, and my brother knows, and he\u2019s trying to comfort me about it but it isn\u2019t actually working.\u201d His lips formed into a pout and it looked like Taehyung was really sulking about this matter. \u201cSorry, this isn\u2019t what we should be talking about.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m -\u201d Jungkook cleared his throat, \u201cI\u2019m really bad at comforting people, too, so I don\u2019t think we should.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was quiet after that, Taehyung merely turning on the radio for some background noise. Taehyung had apparently bought tickets at the biggest cinema in Yongsan, and while Jungkook agreed it was the best place to go it also meant Taehyung had to find parking space pretty far away. Jungkook was okay with walking, but honestly he couldn\u2019t imagine Taehyung wanting to move too much in those shoes of his. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m very used to walking in heels,\u201d Taehyung stated, as if it wasn\u2019t obvious. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook only shrugged, sliding out of the car and closing the door behind him. Taehyung locked the car, shoved his keys in his pockets, and jogged up to Jungkook to grab his upper arm. \u201cWha -\u201d Jungkook uttered, but Taehyung pulled up his phone and turned on the self-camera. \u201cReally? In the parking lot?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Taehyung said. \u201cMy family knows me, which means they know how clingy I am in an actual relationship. And they are not going to believe we have been dating for even a month if I don\u2019t show up with a camera roll completely filled with photos of you.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Taehyung pressed a little closer and asked him to smile, Jungkook did just so, allowing himself to grin wide into the camera. Taehyung leaned down and snapped the photo of them both. \u201cI thought your reputation was that you don\u2019t do relationships,\u201d Jungkook said, because he did remember Taehyung saying that was the case. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d Taehyung groaned. \u201cI just haven\u2019t been with anyone since I came to Seoul. I\u2019ve focused too much on getting somewhere at work to think about dating, and maybe I have had a few one night stands and kind of refused to see it through after. You know, rejecting them. Harshly.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cStone cold.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Taehyung protested. \u201cI am a very warm person.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nAt that Jungkook couldn\u2019t help but actually snort, and Taehyung stopped dead in his tracks to look down at him, disbelievingly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jungkook said, quickly, pulling them along to continue walking, \u201cI just - you haven\u2019t exactly given me good impressions of that you know?\u201d Don\u2019t get him wrong, Jungkook realized there was something underneath Taehyung\u2019s prickly exterior, but there was also a reason why he was named Bubblegum Bitch on Jungkook\u2019s contact list. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow come?\u201d Taehyung said. \u201cHave I been that terrible?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUhm.\u201d Jungkook couldn\u2019t really fathom that Taehyung was asking about this. \u201cI mean, our first meetings were not fortunate. And I\u2019m doing this for the money, not your personality.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOuch,\u201d Taehyung grimaced. \u201cI mean, I know you didn\u2019t exactly like me, Jungkook, but that\u2019s harsh.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook shrugged, but maybe he felt bad because Taehyung\u2019s voice seemed fainter, a little sad. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth. But maybe we can change it, eventually.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Taehyung scoffed. \u201cMission: Get Jungkook To Not Actively Hate Me set in motion.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t hate you, Jungkook wanted to say, but something about Taehyung\u2019s face told him it wouldn\u2019t help much. Taehyung\u2019s mouth was set in a deep frown, and he detached himself from Jungkook\u2019s arm slowly. \n\n\u00a0\n\nGood job, Jeon Jungkook. You really nailed that one. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe walk up to the cinema was far worse than the ride there, the silence now more uncomfortable without background music, and Jungkook couldn\u2019t stop himself from grimacing thinking about what he\u2019d said. It was stupid of him to assume saying stuff like that wouldn\u2019t affect Taehyung, even if Taehyung acted the way he did. He supposed it was one way to find out that Taehyung was a bit sensitive, seeing the way he\u00a0was actively shutting Jungkook\u00a0out. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe quiet followed them all the way to the queue to get their snacks. The line was long, but it was a Marvel movie so Jungkook had expected there to be a lot of people. More people unfortunately also meant more judging stares, and Jungkook really should have expected that not everyone would be okay with the way Taehyung dressed. His tall height already gained attention, and once they saw the heels on his feet the attention usually turned into subtle, negative remarks. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhoever standing right behind them in the queue were not very subtle however, continuously making comments about how weird and freaky it was, and Jungkook - well, Jungkook had never had the best of patience with idiots. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey were just being so obvious, they were right behind them, but when Jungkook might have started contemplating turning around and giving them a piece of his mind, Taehyung lightly elbowed him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said quickly, \u201cdon\u2019t bother. Causing a scene doesn\u2019t help.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook frowned. \u201cOkay. If you say so.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook knew Taehyung was right however. He had encountered enough assholes in his life to know that making a fuss in public was never the way to go. Still, he wasn\u2019t going to just let them be, so, as he slowly looped one arm around Taehyung\u2019s hips - go Jeon, go! - he turned his head briefly around just to glare at the idiots. They were only teenagers, so knocking them out would have been bad anyway, but Jungkook felt a little better when they cowered under his gaze. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAs Jungkook turned back around, Taehyung threw his arm over Jungkook\u2019s shoulders and leaned down slightly. \u201cHow mature of you,\u201d he mumbled, and Jungkook felt the tips of his ears turn red. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung looked like he forced back a smile. \"Okay. Thanks, anyway.\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook grumbled a small reply his own mind couldn't even comprehend, he was too flustered.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey got their snacks, and while sitting down to wait for the doors to open, Taehyung took a few more pictures, indulging Jungkook in doing some funny faces every now and then, trying out possibly every filter he owned. He had thrown his legs over Jungkook\u2019s, cradling their shared box of popcorn to his chest as he scrolled through his camera library and deleted a few of the blurry ones.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHonestly, Jungkook thought it was weird, sitting here with Taehyung and having something as mundane as a movie date with him. Not that it was an actual date, not really, but then again it kind of felt like one, because they were here, together, and it wasn\u2019t like they were pretending for any of Taehyung\u2019s co-workers. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWeird. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nfrom: bubblegum bitch you free after work on tuesday?\n\n\u00a0\n\nto: bubblegum bitch only after seven? is that too late\n\n\u00a0\n\nfrom: bubblegum bitch\n\n\n no, that\u2019s okay, lotte world is open during the night too \n\n\u00a0\n\nto: bubblegum bitch ?????? you wanna go to lotte world???????\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook had not been to Lotte World since he first arrived in Seoul, when\u00a0Jimin had taken him as a welcome to the big city-present. He learned quickly that Taehyung had never been there, and he had also never been on an amusement-park date; much less one that wasn\u2019t really a date, but more like a getting to know each other so we dislike each other less and will be able to go through with this agreement-hangout. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe biggest change from the previous \u2018date\u2019 was clearly Taehyung\u2019s attire. He was wearing jeans again, and a sweater Jungkook assumed was very expensive, but the fact that he was wearing sneakers was what threw Jungkook off. Without the designer heels they were about\u00a0the same height, and Jungkook was really not used to being on Taehyung\u2019s eye-level. \u201cThis is so weird,\u201d he mumbled, measuring their height with his hand. \u201cSo weird.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI thought heels in an amusement park would be a sure-fire way to tire me out completely,\u201d Taehyung scoffed. \u201cAnd I\u2019m already quite drained from working, so it seemed like a good idea.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah - it\u2019s definitely better to walk around in sneakers,\u201d Jungkook agreed, \u201cyou look good either way.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook obviously hadn\u2019t meant to say that last part out loud, but he did anyway. Taehyung gave him a soft smile for it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey bought matching rabbit-ear headbands to wear, so that their pictures would show that they had the full theme park date experience, and with a lot of dead time between rides while waiting in line, they managed to make civil conversation. The more they talked the more Jungkook realized Taehyung was kind of sweet, and while he had always been sure there was something behind the bitchy front he sure hadn\u2019t expected to see it come out whenever they saw a kid running past them. Taehyung just hadn\u2019t seemed like a person who adored kids, but it wasn\u2019t hard to figure out he most certainly did, as Jungkook watched him coo over a toddler sitting next to them on their cotton candy break. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAw, she\u2019s so cute,\u201d Taehyung voiced as the mother picked her little girl up. It was getting late, so it seemed like they were leaving the park before night hours. \u201cI love kids.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah - I didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung shrugged, taking a small bite of his cotton candy. \u201cI could tell, but - well,\u201d he looked at Jungkook, quickly, \u201cnow you know. My deep dark secret. Better not tell the tabloids.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook pressed his lips together and scooted a little closer to Taehyung on the bench. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, \u201csorry if I - say things that make you feel bad. I just - I have this very bad picture of you in my head because we had a shitty first meeting, and I feel like you\u2019ve - like you\u2019ve taken advantage of me?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Taehyung uttered. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nOh shit. Maybe this wasn\u2019t making things better at all. \u201cI just - I have a hard time saying no to you, and I might have felt like this whole fake-dating deal was made because you knew I would say yes for the money. I didn\u2019t know about the thing with your family or anything, and - yeah, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m still talking.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Taehyung narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou feel like I\u2019ve been taking advantage of you because of your business? Am I understanding this right?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nYeah, he was right. Jungkook didn\u2019t know why it made him feel weird, because he had admitted to agreeing to this for the money. But he still felt like Taehyung had too tight of a grip around this deal - like he was calling all the shots. And fair enough - Taehyung was the one paying for everything, but Jungkook had been pushed around by Taehyung since the moment they met. \u201cYes,\u201d Jungkook confirmed. \u201cI mean, I get that it sounds weird, but -\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Taehyung cut him off, \u201cI can understand that. I\u2019ve been kind of bossy.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nKind of. Jungkook bit his tongue. \u201cA little, maybe.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Taehyung nodded, \u201cnext date you decide. Everything.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou heard me.\u201d Taehyung stood up, made his way to the closest trashcan, and threw away what was left of melted sugar on the cotton candy stick. \u201cNow - let\u2019s go have fun, baby.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo - wait!\u201d Jungkook exclaimed, jumping up from his seat to run after Taehyung. One downside to him wearing sneakers was that he was now harder to keep up with. Jungkook followed him into line to one of the rollercoasters; Taehyung tugged him to his side and linked their arms together. \u201cI don\u2019t - why would you - where do you even want to go?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung shrugged. \u201cSurprise me,\u201d he said. \u201cHalf of the fun going on a date is not knowing what your boyfriend has planned, you know?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook didn\u2019t know. He was also very confused, because he was certain Taehyung had said the only reason they were going around having \u2018dates\u2019 was because they needed picture proof. \u201cBut we\u2019re - we\u2019re not really dating?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung sighed deeply, dramatically, a deep furrow appearing between his brows. \u201cListen, Jungkook - you need to stop thinking this much. I\u2019m going to make this very simple for your pretty head so that this whole ordeal will be all the better for both of us.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUh -\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFrom now, until the launch party, we are dating. All you have to do is treat me like I\u2019m your boyfriend, and everything will be fine.\u201d He smiled, but it was condescending in a way. \u201cDon\u2019t think too much about it, and just\u2026 think of it as actual courting. Stop reminding yourself that it\u2019s fake all the time, because that\u2019s just going to make the launch party awkward. We need to get to know each other like - like we actually want to date. Get it?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook kind of got it, but he supposed his facial expression did not show that, because Taehyung sighed deeply again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFor example,\u201d he stated, voicing every syllable, and then he cupped Jungkook\u2019s face, leaned forward, and kissed him. Jungkook reeled back in shock, crashing into a high school boy standing behind them, but he couldn\u2019t even utter an apology because Kim Taehyung pulled him back in. Chased after his lips. Kissed him again. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung tasted of sugar.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook was partially frozen, because, well, he hadn\u2019t expected that. A part of him was yelling do something you idiot, but before he could act on that Taehyung pulled away, smacked his shoulder and said, \u201cas my boyfriend, you are supposed to kiss back, you imbecile,\u201d clearly agitated. There was also a slight blush on his cheeks, which threw Jungkook off. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh. Oh, yeah, of course,\u201d Jungkook mumbled, awkwardly. He met the eyes of someone else in the queue, who was gaping at the both of them. \u201cUhm - right. Let me just -\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung groaned. \u201cDo you have to be so painfully awkward doing everything?\u201d he voiced, pulling away. \u201cYou lost it. The moment is gone. Man.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Jungkook mumbled. \u201cC-can I awkwardly hold your hand instead?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe didn\u2019t wait for Taehyung\u2019s reply, just interlaced their fingers. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood save,\u201d Taehyung uttered. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook breathed in deep. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll really \u2014 I\u2019ll try not to act this awkward from now on. I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t actually want us to be weird around each other. It would be horrible at the launch party thing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung snorted. \u201cLaunch party thing,\u201d he repeated shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t want that either. Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s aim for civil? Not going at each others throats and also not being painfully awkward?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung smiled brighter than the sun, squeezed Jungkook\u2019s hand a little.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jungkook voiced, lips still tingling from the\u00a0kiss, \u201ccivil.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nDespite what Taehyung had said, Jungkook was not the one to organize\u00a0the next date. Taehyung spontaneously planned their outings before Jungkook managed to even think about where to bring him. It made him a little nervous, because he felt like Taehyung was expecting something, and Jungkook had no idea what to do not to disappoint. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook did try to act little less awkward around Taehyung however. He made sure to initiate holding Taehyung\u2019s hand whenever they walked the streets together, and even if they hadn\u2019t kissed since the amusement park date, Jungkook felt like it was getting somewhere. They were hanging out, asking questions about each other, and whatever hostility that had been between them was slowly dimming. It was a lot more comfortable just sitting next to Taehyung, holding his hand and taking sickeningly cute pictures together. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay, so \u2014 question,\u201d Taehyung said through a mouthful of churros. It was Thursday afternoon, and Taehyung had dragged Jungkook to this quaint little caf\u00e9-slash-flower shop in Yongsan. It was cozy, quiet, and Taehyung looked painstakingly beautiful surrounded by colorful plants. Sigh. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBring it.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung licked his fingers free of sugar. \u201cI read your webpage more thoroughly after you told me you don\u2019t only do deliveries. So \u2014 what\u2019s the weirdest job you\u2019ve gotten?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGotten?\u201d Jungkook said. \u201cOr done?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung\u2019s eyebrows raised to his hairline, and suddenly his eyes were glittering with interest. \u201cDone. Definitely done.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook had done a lot of stuff \u2014 things he never imagined doing \u2014 but he knew what the weirdest thing was. He knew Taehyung was probably going to laugh, too, but - go big or go home. \u201cWell \u2014 I was a stripper, once. For a bachelorette party.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung\u2019s mouth dropped. \u201cNo? For real?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nNodding his head, Jungkook took a tentative sip of his coffee. It wasn\u2019t a job he liked thinking about often (unless he was very drunk), but he\u2019d taken it before Jiwoo started filtering through weird requests and he was really desperate for money. Jimin liked reminding him about his dark past on the pole, even if there was never a pole involved and Jungkook only did it once. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, for real.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung looked like he really did not believe it. \u201cI mean \u2014 isn\u2019t that kind of\u2026 illegal?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nShrug. Jungkook wasn\u2019t entirely sure, actually, but he didn\u2019t really see why it should have been. His client had been very upfront about what they wanted and Jungkook had just showed up to\u2026 deliver. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t remember a lot of it because I was trying to just dance and get it over with \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou danced.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah. Lapdance. Sexy dance. Magic Mike style.\u201d Jungkook grimaced. \u201cNot my proudest moment.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook didn\u2019t miss the way Taehyung\u2019s eyes seemed to trail over his body for a moment. \u201cHuh. Did you dress up, too?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d Jungkook frowned. \u201cPolice uniform. Didn't stay on long.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh my God.\u201d Taehyung leaned over the table, resting his chin in his hands and staring at Jungkook with interest. \u201cWere your clients happy with your performance? All like \u2018oh yeah handcuff me, officer\u2019?\u201d Taehyung grinned wickedly. \u201cYou good at dancing sensually and taking your clothes off, baby?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook tried to hide the fact that the stupid nickname was affecting him, bringing his almost-empty cup of coffee to his lips. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung didn\u2019t answer to the last statement (Jungkook hadn\u2019t expected him to, either), but Jungkook could feel the piercing gaze the older\u00a0was giving him. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHm.\u201d Taehyung leaned back in his seat, grin slowly sliding off his face. \u201cI think \u2014 as understanding as my parents and brother are, we shouldn\u2019t mention that to them at the launch party. Like \u2014 that\u2019s more of an ice breaker during a boring Christmas gathering, not fitted for somewhere with paparazzi and stuff.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nWell, Jungkook hadn\u2019t exactly planned on telling Taehyung\u2019s parents what he was working with at all. The thought of them asking, \u2018so what do you do, kid,\u2019 sent a small chill down his spine, which was a little silly because he wasn\u2019t even Taehyung\u2019s real boyfriend. But, somehow, Jungkook imagined Taehyung\u2019s parents not being very happy with him dating a delivery boy. \u201cI mean \u2014 that was not the first thing I had planned on sharing with them,\u201d Jungkook said, slowly. \u201cShould we even say what my job is? I mean \u2014 I just,\u201d he hesitated, \u201cI haven\u2019t even gone to college.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung waved it off, like it was no big deal. \u201cNeither did my father, but he\u2019s still considered a genius in the fashion industry. It\u2019s just a different time, and honestly the fact that you don\u2019t go to school doesn\u2019t make you any less valid. Or at least it shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Shrugging his shoulders, Taehyung gave Jungkook a small, reassuring smile that made Jungkook\u2019s insides all warm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Jungkook. With me having dated mostly male models, I\u2019m sure my parents wouldn\u2019t mind me bringing someone with a bit more life experience.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nMale models. Jungkook gulped. \u201cYou\u2019ve dated models?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMhm, quite a few.\u201d Taehyung snorted. \u201cThey all get tired of me real fast. Guess I\u2019m not that easy for them to handle.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMaybe you just have bad taste.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung lifted one eyebrow. \u201cReferring to yourself?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nScoffing, Jungkook leaned a little back in his chair. \u201cI\u2019m a catch.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m downgrading from male models to a delivery boy,\u201d Taehyung pointed out, lips quirking into a smile. Jungkook knew he wasn\u2019t serious, but he still pursed his lips a little at Taehyung\u2019s words. \u201cSo far the only thing you have in common with all my previous boyfriends is that you\u2019re just as much of an asshole.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cExcuse you,\u201d Jungkook said, a little offended, \u201cbut I am a delight behind all this awkwardness.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThrowing his head back, Taehyung laughed, loudly, and the sound itself made Jungkook grin. He couldn\u2019t even stop it from happening; Taehyung\u2019s laugh was oddly carefree and childish, so far from the person he'd met at studio three a few weeks ago. It made Jungkook unexplainably happy seeing him loosen up.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was serious, though,\u201d Taehyung said when he had finally stopped laughing, drying away a fake tear. \u201cMy parents won\u2019t mind that you\u2019re not like my previous boyfriends. If anything that might make them more interested in you, honestly. But don\u2019t worry \u2014 I\u2019ll make sure we don\u2019t have to talk to them that much.\u201d He smiled again, in that reassuring way, and Jungkook was sure his breath hitched. \n\n\u00a0\n\n No, Jungkook. Don\u2019t.  \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey \u2014 I,\u201d Jungkook cleared his throat, suddenly feeling like he couldn't leave fast enough, \u201cI might have some work later today, so could we get going? This was nice and all, but \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh. Oh, yeah, sure,\u201d Taehyung said, hurrying\u00a0to gather his things. \u201cI was going to send you the photos we took today, but I guess that can wait?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook blinked. \u201cOh. Why?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust,\u201d Taehyung started, hesitating, \u201cit would be more believable if we both had pictures of each other? Just put one of them as your screensaver or something, for the time being.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt probably wasn\u2019t necessary for them to play it out to this extent, but Jungkook wasn\u2019t going to say anything against it. \u201cYeah okay \u2014 send them to me now, then, I\u2019ll go use the bathroom in the meantime.\u201d He gave Taehyung a short smile and the practically fled to the bathroom, blood ringing in his ears. His heart was beating wildly as he shut the door to one of the small stalls behind him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nStop. Jesus Christ, Jeon Jungkook, get a grip. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was one thing that Taehyung was attractive \u2014 that much was known, and Jungkook couldn\u2019t say anything against it. Taehyung was gorgeous, but thankfully he had seemed to have a sort of shitty personality. Jungkook wasn\u2019t expecting Taehyung to be a little bit soft underneath that bitchy exterior. His smile made Jungkook feel all warm and gooey inside and fuck, this was not good. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook didn\u2019t actually use the bathroom, but he spent a good ten minutes just staring at himself in the mirror, trying to calm himself down. This wasn\u2019t the end of the world, he tried to tell himself. It was just a tiny, tiny crush. He\u2019d been infatuated with Taehyung before this deal even started, starstruck by his appearance alone, so honestly this development shouldn\u2019t surprise him. No matter how untimely it was. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry that took a while,\u201d Jungkook said when he returned, trying not to make it obvious he\u2019d been splashing water in his own face. \u201cI\u2019m \u2014 are you ready to leave?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d Taehyung said, curtly. \u201cSent you all the photos, too.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe slight shift in the mood didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Jungkook. He considered asking if something was wrong, but Taehyung was already heading towards the exit, and Jungkook barely managed to get all his stuff \u2014 including the phone he almost left on their table \u2014 before following. \u201cH-hey, Taehyu \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow about you manage the next date, baby?\u201d Taehyung said suddenly, still not looking in Jungkook\u2019s direction. The way he said the pet name gave Jungkook the creeps. \u201cWe already talked about it, but you haven\u2019t exactly taken initiative.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cN-no, I \u2014 I mean, I can\u2026 do that?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung turned then, finally, and gave Jungkook a small smile. \n\n\u00a0\n\n Ba-bump. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood. I\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThat night Jungkook anxiously googled \u201cwhere to take your rich, high-maintenance boyfriend on a date\u201d. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nTurns out, Jungkook had no idea exactly what sort of date Taehyung would like. He had been panicking about it the entire night, and so when he arrived at Jimin\u2019s tattoo parlor the next morning without any plan his inner turmoil might have been very obvious. At least that\u2019s what he assumed, because Heeyeon stopped dead in her tracks when she saw him and said, \u201cwow, you look like shit.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMore than usual?\u201d Jungkook asked. \n\n\u00a0\n\nShe nodded. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPalming his face in his hands, Jungkook let out a long groan. \u201cI have no idea what to do. Noona - what do I do?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\u2018Bout what?\u201d she asked, quirking one perfect eyebrow. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAbout -\u201d Jungkook paused, remembering the talk he and Taehyung had at Lotte World, how he\u2019d said Jungkook should just treat their fake relationship as a real one until the launch party. Jungkook was still coming to terms with it, but this was as good of a time as any to test it out. Before his small crush, this was a job, and Jungkook might as well get some money with the heartbreak. \u201cAbout my boyfriend,\u201d he continued, feeling the flush on his cheeks already. \u201cI have no idea where to take him on a date.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d Jimin stuck his head out from his studio. \u201cYour sorry ass got a boyfriend?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks for the vote of confidence, hyung,\u201d Jungkook drawled. \u201cY-yes. I guess. You a-already met him.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJimin\u2019s mouth dropped open, and he pointed an accusing finger in Jungkook\u2019s direction. \u201cYou\u2019re joking? The hot guy in the designer heels is your boyfriend?\u201d He shared a look with Heeyeon. \u201cSeriously, Heeyeon-ah, you didn\u2019t see him. He had like - perfect face, perfect proportions, great legs -\u201d Jimin shook his head, as if he really couldn\u2019t believe it. Jungkook would be offended, but he was pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t have been able to get someone like Kim Taehyung to date him under normal circumstances. \u201cAnyway, he\u2019s hot. And really pretty, like - how did you get that much game, Jeon Jungkook?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook shrugged, because he honestly didn\u2019t know how to answer that question. He knew he wasn\u2019t a bad-looking guy by anyone\u2019s standards, but Taehyung prowled in male models and superstars. Jungkook couldn\u2019t live up to that. \u201cAnyway - I need to take him on a date. But I have no idea where he would like to go.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give you a hint?\u201d Jimin asked. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jungkook frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s hard to read.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThere was Kim Taehyung, bubblegum bitch, who bossed Jungkook around and stepped all over him in his limited edition Valentinos; and then there was just Taehyung, the guy who spoke in a forced Seoul accent, cooed over children, laughed with his whole body and blushed after kissing Jungkook in the line to the rollercoaster. Jungkook was becoming well-aware Taehyung was a mix of both hard ambition and a warm heart, and it confused him how much he liked it. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust bring him out with us today,\u201d Jimin said, like it was no big deal. \u201cWe\u2019re going to Hongdae to drink, it\u2019ll be fun if we have someone new with us. Hyerin is joining as well.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nA part of Jungkook screamed that it was a bad idea. Why would Kim Taehyung be happy hanging out with Jungkook and his friends for a date, just walking around Hongdae, getting food and drinks and staying out all night? But then again Taehyung had said treat me like you would treat anyone you are dating, and Jungkook always brought potential boyfriends to meet his friends. Usually not this early, but it would be good practice for the launch party. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBefore he could change his mind, Jungkook grabbed his phone and texted Taehyung. \n\n\u00a0\n\n to:  bubblegum bitch \n\n\nhey, let\u2019s go out tonight. i\u2019m going out with my friends and my cousin that you met last time. \n\n\u00a0\n\n from:  bubblegum bitch \n\n\nis that your idea of a date, baby?\n\n\u00a0\n\n to:  bubblegum bitch \n\n\nit\u2019s good practice for the launch party\n\n\u00a0\n\n from:  bubblegum bitch \n\n\ni see. when? \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook felt like he had made a mistake, but he quickly typed 9PM, i\u2019ll tell you where later, and closed the screen on his phone. At least no he didn\u2019t have to think too much about it for a few hours, and could focus on work. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOr that\u2019s what he told himself, but instead he was all the more aware of the fact that Taehyung was coming to drink with them in Hongdae, Taehyung had agreed to do so, and now Jungkook was even more nervous. Just hanging out with Taehyung and getting to know him was one thing, but now they actually had to act like a couple. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, maybe Jungkook realized what a bad fucking idea it was when he stood outside Hongdae station, exit 3, waiting for Taehyung to show up. He had left the restaurant they had picked out to pick Taehyung up - because Taehyung was a little late and honestly Jungkook could understand that looking that good would take time - and it had given Jungkook time to think. Think about everything Taehyung had said that he liked, what he usually did in a relationship, and compared it to himself. Jungkook hadn\u2019t had terribly many boyfriends, but he had introduced them all to Jimin at one point, and Jimin always made fun of it because Jungkook was apparently a\u00a0fool in love. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook wasn\u2019t exactly sure what that meant, but Taehyung had called him idiot enough times for Jungkook to realize there must be a pattern. All Jungkook had to do was act stupidly in love, right? He could do that. He was an extra at his middle school\u2019s play once. Ladybug number five. He got this. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung was suddenly there, looking a little out of breath. He was wearing a white sweater with plenty of holes down the sides on it - probably fashion purposes, damned if Jungkook knew - and a pair of nice, light jeans. The stilettos on his feel were gold, with a thin heel and sequins. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late, the subway was delayed as well.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook was going to ask you took the subway? but instead he pulled Taehyung in by the waist, leaned up and planted a kiss to his cheek. Taehyung looked baffled, black-lined eyes widening at Jungkook\u2019s open display of affection. \u201cLook at you,\u201d Taehyung voiced, cocking his head to the side as he threw his arms over Jungkook\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re learning.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Jungkook said. \u201cI\u2019m just greeting my boyfriend.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe look Taehyung gave him clearly said good job, but he didn\u2019t say anything about it, rather leaned down to peck Jungkook\u2019s lips, quickly. \u201cHello, baby.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook made a small sound in the back of his throat, immediately avoiding Taehyung\u2019s eyes. \u201cCan you not call me that?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Taehyung asked, smirking. \u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jungkook lied, immediately, blush rising to his cheeks. It probably wasn\u2019t good for him, how much he blushed in the presence of Taehyung. \u201cI mean - no, I like it, it\u2019s just -\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLike it a bit too much, do ya?\u201d Taehyung asked, grinning widely, and the mix of him not forcing his accent and throwing that smile in Jungkook\u2019s direction was just\u2026 too much. He groaned, and pushing his face into Taehyung\u2019s shoulder, the holes in his sweater placed conveniently enough so that his lips pressed against bare skin. \u201cCome on baby,\u201d Taehyung crooned, voice low, \u201cit\u2019s cute how much it affects you, you know?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nCute. Jungkook gritted his teeth through the embarrassment. \u201cShut up, Tae.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung grinned even wider. \u201cNow that\u2019s better. Let\u2019s go!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook willed his flaming face to cool down and started leading Taehyung through the bustling crowd of Hongdae\u2019s streets. They held hands the whole way, Jungkook looking over his shoulder now and then to meet Taehyung\u2019s eyes, but they walked in silence. It wasn\u2019t uncomfortable however, because Taehyung\u2019s hand was warm in his and Jungkook - Jungkook already had high hopes for tonight. Being with his cousin meant they had to act fully in love, and that meant Jungkook had an excuse to act on his crush for the evening. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was something. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJimin and the others had decided on a quiet bar, located in the cellar under a few cheaper shops. It sold about every soju flavor possible and had really good food as well, and Jungkook was pretty sure they\u2019d been here at least three times just the past month. Taehyung walked down the steep stairs before him, still holding onto Jungkook\u2019s hand for support. Jungkook told the waiter approaching them that they already had a table, and they were let inside. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHonestly, as soon as Hyerin was involved it was difficult not to find their little group in a crowd. Heeyeon and Jimin already stood out with their kind-of intimidating appearances, but Hyerin was loud. She worked as a tour bus guide\u00a0while finishing her journalism\u00a0degree, and was just accustomed to screaming about sixty percent of everything she said. She was in the middle of a dramatic monologue when he and Taehyung found their seats at the table - Jimin had moved out of his seat and made them squeeze into the booth together - and even the arrival of Taehyung couldn\u2019t shut her up. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey! Taehyung, right? Nice to meet you,\u201d Hyerin said quickly, \u201canyway, as I was saying -\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook couldn\u2019t help but snort at Taehyung\u2019s baffled expression. \u201cIs she always this high-energy?\u201d he asked, and Jungkook nodded. \u201cImpressive.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou met Jimin already,\u201d Jungkook said, motioning towards his cousin. \u201cAnd that\u2019s Heeyeon, the co-owner of the tattoo parlor.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood to meet you,\u201d Heeyeon grinned, winking at Taehyung, \u201cI\u2019ve heard lots about you.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHave you, now?\u201d Taehyung voiced, glancing in Jungkook\u2019s direction. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou have?\u201d Jungkook asked, just as surprised. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHeeyeon pointed in Jimin\u2019s direction with her thumb. \u201cHe met you for like ten seconds and wouldn\u2019t shut up about it.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was a meaningful meeting,\u201d Jimin said. Hyerin seemed to have finally finished her dramatic tour bus story, and was drinking from a large pint of beer that was probably meant to be shared. Everyone\u2019s full attention was now on Taehyung \u2014 and Jungkook \u2014 and Jimin was leaning over the table, head resting in his hands. \u201cYou know, Taehyung-ssi \u2014 Jungkook is awfully boring. I\u2019m sure the two of us could have a lot more fun together.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook blinked at the sultry look Jimin was giving Taehyung. \u201cAre you \u2014 are you flirting with my boyfriend, hyung \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n(He almost stuttered over that word; boyfriend. Almost.)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m giving him a chance to back out on a possible life filled with your nerdy ass and vanilla sex,\u201d Jimin grinned, cocking his head to the side innocently. Jungkook wasn\u2019t entirely sure how to reply to an insult like that, not when Taehyung was right there. Especially not when Jimin\u2019s words made him imagine waking up to Taehyung in the morning. Abort. \u201cI mean \u2014 Jungkook is plenty attractive and all, but damn. Everything kind of pales in comparison to Taehyung.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThough I appreciate your concern, Jimin, as well as the compliment,\u201d Taehyung started \u2014 Jungkook could hear the amusement in his voice \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m more than happy with my boring ass vanilla man, thanks.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTae\u2014\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice go cut off as Taehyung latched onto him like cling-wrap, arms wrapping around Jungkook\u2019s midsection and nuzzling into his neck. His breath hitched, barely, as Taehyung\u2019s arms squeezed around him, and his glossy lips pressed a kiss right under Jungkook\u2019s ear. Jungkook took a deep breath before allowing himself to turn his head, and then Taehyung was staring right at him, eyes warm and smile bright, and Jungkook let himself forget that this was not real. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe leaned forward, slightly, and barely brushed his lips against Taehyung\u2019s. \u201cThanks, babe,\u201d he said, relishing in Taehyung\u2019s eyes widening briefly at the public display of affection. Jungkook supposed he didn\u2019t have any expectations of Jungkook actually initiating any intimacy. Hah. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung caught himself quickly, however, grinning wide. \u201cGive me a kiss,\u201d he said, puckering his lips up, and Jungkook leaned forward to press his mouth against Taehyung\u2019s before he could think too much and possibly regret it. Taehyung had probably intended for it to be a quick peck, but as he moved away Jungkook pulled him in again, angling his head and deepening the kiss. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe kiss in the queue to the rollercoaster hadn\u2019t been like this. This time Jungkook had taken initiative, because he wasn\u2019t going to upset Taehyung by having a slow reaction again. The kiss was soft, warm, and Taehyung pressed his lips against Jungkook\u2019s just right, fingers playing with the short hairs in the nape of his neck. It was just very\u2026 pleasant, to the point where Jungkook thought he wouldn\u2019t mind doing it again. Or continue doing it for the rest of the night, at least. Or maybe for another year. \n\n\u00a0\n\n(Stop, a voice reminded him.)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Jimin complained noisily from the other side of the table, and Jungkook barely opened one eye to look at him without breaking the kiss. \u201cYou guys are gross.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI would say I\u2019m sorry, hyung,\u201d Jungkook voiced, barely pulling away from Taehyung\u2019s lips; kissing him was kind of addictive. \u201cBut not really.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung laughed, pressing a loud peck to Jungkook\u2019s cheek.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt felt so natural, to the point where Jungkook had no idea why he had been the slightest bit nervous about acting like he was in love with Taehyung. Taehyung\u2026 he he made it easy, which was weird, because it shouldn\u2019t be easy pretending you\u2019re in love with someone you kind of used to dislike. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThough Jungkook was pretty sure he really didn\u2019t dislike Taehyung anymore. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung was actually kind of great. \n\n\u00a0\n\nYou\u2019re crushing on him so hard, a voice that sounded eerily much like Jiwoo\u2019s told him, in a disappointed tone. Jungkook shrugged it off. He could deal with his own bad decisions without the conscience of his co-worker whispering at the back of his head.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCan you guys stop being cute for like, five seconds so we can order?\u201d Heeyeon commented, sweet smile on her burgundy lips. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still going to be cute,\u201d Taehyung grinned, keeping his arm around Jungkook\u2019s waist. \u201cBut I\u2019m also starving, and I haven\u2019t had really greasy chicken in so long.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey ordered enough chicken and beer to keep them satisfied for the whole night, probably, and the food arrived and conversations flowed naturally, Jungkook thought less about trying to convince his cousin him and Taehyung were actually a thing and more about having fun. Sure, the kiss was a burning reminder on his lips still after two shots of soju, and he was blissfully aware of Taehyung touching him at all times, but it\u2019s not like he was nervous anymore. Not at all \u2014 they could totally fool Taehyung\u2019s family at that fancy gala, or whatever. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo you work for Bangtan Magazine?\u201d Heeyeon said, mouth slightly open in surprise. \u201cI read you guys\u2019 articles all the time. I loved the photoshoot that was on your New Years\u2019 edition last year, man \u2014 it was so beautiful I shed a tear.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung looked immensely proud. \u201cThank you! It was my idea, actually \u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Heeyeon hissed. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re great. I love you. I\u2019ll subscribe to you magazine. Please break up with Jungkook so I can have you instead.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook frowned, tightening his arms around Taehyung. \u201cWhat is this? Steal-Jungkook\u2019s-hot-boyfriend-day?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it that I\u2019m popular, baby.\u201d Taehyung winked, chewing around a piece of spicy chicken. \u201cBut we already established that I\u2019m not going anywhere, so don\u2019t you worry too much. Have something more to drink, instead \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook grunted as Jimin shoved a bottle of beer towards him. \u201cNo thanks,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI might have deliveries tomorrow, so I can\u2019t really be too hungover. Or, you know, still drunk.\u201d Of course, it was a little rude to decline drinks since he was the youngest, but Jungkook valued being able to drive everywhere for his morning deliveries. He would rather not want to rely on public transport. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUgh, buzzkill.\u201d Jimin rolled his eyes. \u201cYou can handle another beer, Jeon. You\u2019re from Busan, it\u2019s in your blood.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nSighing in defeat, Jungkook grabbed for the bottle, but Taehyung\u2019s hand shot out and took it instead. \u201cI\u2019ll just drink for him, Jimin,\u201d he grinned, pressing the bottle to his lips. He peered up at Jungkook, giving him a quite sultry look through his eyelashes. \u201cI\u2019ll be your Black Knight*, Jeon Jungkook. So I guess that means you\u2019re mine for the rest of the evening.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat works, I guess,\u201d Jungkook mumbled, ignoring Jimin\u2019s loud wolf-whistle. \u201cIf it\u2019s okay, I mean. How\u2019s your tolerance?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPretty shit,\u201d Taehyung laughed. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt did turn out Taehyung\u2019s tolerance was pretty shit, and Jungkook could clearly tell when Taehyung tipped the line from tipsy to pretty intoxicated. Jungkook did not really mind, because as Jimin and Heeyeon and Hyerin started talking about a second round at the nearest karaoke place, they had an excuse to leave. Jungkook could easily drape Taehyung\u2019s arm over his shoulder and lead him out of the chicken place. With his arm around Taehyung\u2019s waist, Jungkook supported his fake boyfriend down the streets of Hongdae once again, hand systematically placed over one of the holes in Taehyung\u2019s flimsy shirt. Great. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung wasn\u2019t really loud drunk. He said some weird things \u2014 and cute things \u2014 but mostly it seemed he just got sleepy. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSure you guys don\u2019t want to join us?\u201d Jimin asked as they finally hailed down a cab. \u201cI mean \u2014 I was planning on wooing Taehyung with my singing abilities, but here you are dragging him away from having a good time! I cannot believe you would foil my plan like this, Jeon Jungkook. We\u2019re supposed to be family.\u201d It was all for fun, obviously, but Jungkook couldn\u2019t help but roll his eyes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung laughed at Jimin\u2019s comment; Jungkook helped him get into the awaiting cab, making sure he didn\u2019t hit his head on the way in. \u201cHe gets tired when he\u2019s drunk,\u201d Jungkook said as excuse, giving Jimin a small grin. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll meet again, you can try woo him next time, Jimin-hyung. We\u2019ll leave first \u2014 you guys have a nice time!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBye!\u201d Taehyung said from inside the cab; Hyerin and Heeyeon chorused his goodbye and waved at him with drunken smiles on their flushed faces. Jungkook followed Taehyung into the car, sliding into the seat next to him and closing the door behind him. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d the cab driver asked them once they settled. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI live too far away,\u201d Taehyung mumbled, falling onto Jungkook\u2019s shoulder. They didn\u2019t need to sit close, there was no reason for them to act lovey dovey in front of a stranger, but Taehyung still clung to Jungkook\u2019s side, like gum. \u201cI\u2019m your Black Knight, baby, so you still owe me. Let\u2019s just go to your place, yeah?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook gulped, mind envisioning all possible outcomes of this situation. Most of them included very little clothes. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he uttered, telling the taxi driver his address. Then he leaned back into the seat and stared into the roof of the car, asking whatever higher being was up there for\u00a0strength. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n*Black Knight(/Black Rose): Someone who volunteers to take a drink for another person, and in return the person they drink for is theirs for the rest of the evening (or owes them a wish).\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ncome scream to me on tumblr\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNice place you have here. Cute.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung looked around the tiny apartment from where he was sitting by Jungkook\u2019s dining table nursing a cup of chamomile tea. Jungkook assumed Taehyung and his family had enough money to live in a mansion, so he was pretty sure the older was just making fun of him. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s a little messy, I wasn\u2019t really expecting company.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m the one who is intruding,\u201d Taehyung said, though he did not sound particularly apologetic about the fact. He took a loud sip of the tea, and even though he still looked a little bit flushed and drunk he didn\u2019t seem it. He\u2019d kicked off his heels by the entrance, the gold-sequin designer shoes looking very out of place next to Jungkook\u2019s many pairs of Timberlands. Still, Taehyung looked surprisingly comfortable in Jungkook\u2019s bachelor pad, and Jungkook would say the sight of Taehyung sipping tea in his kitchen wasn\u2019t\u2026 unwelcome. \n\n\u00a0\n\n(He\u2019d love to get used to the sight.)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just crash on your couch for the night, then,\u201d Taehyung said, resting his head in his hands. He looked very kid-like, cheeks cutely smushed up and small smile on his lips. \u201cMay I borrow something to sleep in?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUh \u2014 yeah,\u201d Jungkook stuttered. \u201cBut \u2014 but it\u2019s probably better if you stay in my room, honestly, since I\u2019m probably going out tomorrow morning for deliveries. So I wouldn\u2019t want to wake you up or anything, and \u2014 I\u2019ll go get you something to change into.\u201d His voice grew more quiet the more he spoke, because honestly Jungkook wasn\u2019t completely grasping the situation. \u201cYou can \u2014 you can come with, if you want to.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung hummed, took another small sip of his tea, and then followed Jungkook into his bedroom. If you told Jungkook about two weeks ago that Kim Taehyung would ever be in his bedroom, he would have thought you were crazy. Not that Jungkook minded having Taehyung in his bedroom \u2014 that was a completely different discourse \u2014 but he wouldn\u2019t have thought it possible. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNice. I like your G-Dragon poster,\u201d Taehyung commented as Jungkook stepped over a small pile of clothes to get to his closet. Taehyung didn\u2019t seem to mind the small mess, or at least he made no move to snidely mention it, which Jungkook appreciated. That, or Taehyung was still too drunk to notice. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook threw one of his many white t-shirts in Taehyung\u2019s general direction. \u201cDo you want some sweatpants, too?\u201d he asked, turning around to look at Taehyung over his shoulder. His breath got stuck in his throat when Taehyung proceed to simply pull his own sweater over his head. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll just sleep in my underwear,\u201d Taehyung said. Jungkook was long lost staring at Taehyung\u2019s exposed skin like some creep, but could you blame him? He was so flawless, body slim and tummy surprisingly soft-looking, and he had a navel piercing. It glinted under the dim light before he pulled Jungkook\u2019s oversized sweater over his head. If Taehyung could just have bothered to turn around so Jungkook could check if he was serious about the tattoo as well \u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, this is very comfortable,\u201d Taehyung hummed. The t-shirt reached him mid-thigh, but honestly thats how big they were on Jungkook, too, so it wasn\u2019t all that surprising. This visual however was at least three of Jungkook\u2019s sexual fantasies in one, and he was not sure how long he could manage standing here, just watching. \u201cThanks, baby,\u201d Taehyung said, pulling Jungkook out of his perverted daze. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u2018Get a grip, Jeon.\u2019  \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d Jungkook said, voice strained. \u2018Yes problem. Yes very much growing problem.\u2019 \u201cUhm \u2014 the bathroom is over there, if you want to wash up. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have an extra toothbrush or anything, but \u2014 but you c-can borrow \u2014\u201d he gulped as Taehyung advanced towards him, smile on his face just a little bit wicked, \u201c\u2014 toothpaste,\u201d Jungkook finished weakly. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung leaned in, and then he pecked Jungkook\u2019s cheek, and giggled. He giggled. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThank you, baby.\u201d Taehyung slowly wrapped his arms around Jungkook\u2019s neck and pressed their foreheads together, and Jungkook took a deep breath at the close proximity.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung still smelled like bubblegum. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you wash up,\u201d Jungkook mumbled. \u201cUhm \u2014 I might accidentally wake you up tomorrow morning, but I\u2019ll try to be quiet \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSleep in the bed with me, Jeon Jungkook.\u201d Taehyung was smiling, and he threaded his fingers through Jungkook\u2019s messy hair. \u201cIt\u2019s your place, and if you\u2019re leaving early tomorrow morning, so should I.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook closed his eyes as Taehyung pecked his nose, and then his cheeks, and his lips. \u201cThis is so weird,\u201d Jungkook mumbled, carefully cupping Taehyung\u2019s face; he smushed Taehyung\u2019s soft cheeks together, feeling how warm his skin was thanks to the alcohol. \u201cYou\u2019re so nice. And also very drunk. Why can\u2019t you be this nice to me all the time, we\u2019d get along so well, then.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung laughed, leaning against Jungkook\u2019s frame. \u201cYou want me to be nice and kiss you all the time, Jeon Jungkook?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was kind of embarrassing, how fast he replied. It brought an even bigger smile to Taehyung\u2019s face. \u201cWell, sober Taehyung will definitely work on that,\u201d he said, and Jungkook knew he was for sure blushing down to his neck. \u201cI\u2019m really sleepy, baby.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cO-okay,\u201d Jungkook stuttered, and Taehyung effectively pulled him onto the mattress; Taehyung snuggling into his blankets was the cutest fucking thing Jungkook had ever seen, and he barely managed to school his expression before sliding in under the covers with his\u2026 fake-boyfriend. Fake-boyfriends were really, really not supposed to share beds, yet here they were. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey laid face to face, just staring at each other, for what felt like the longest time. Taehyung looked so soft, so far away from the person Jungkook had saved as bubblegum bitch in his phone those weeks ago. He looked like he belonged there, in Jungkook\u2019s springy bed. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so fun hanging out with you,\u201d Taehyung mumbled, face partially smushed into Jungkook\u2019s pillow. \u201cYou don\u2019t care.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I care about you. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t care what I wear,\u201d Taehyung started, \u201cyou said I look nice in everything. And you don\u2019t care that I eat a lot of sugar and junk food. You probably don\u2019t care that I\u2019ve neglected my diet, or that my Seoul dialect is horrible.\u201d He smiled, tiredly. \u201cIt\u2019s nice.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Jungkook cleared his throat as Taehyung moved a little closer to him. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m glad \u2014 what are you d-doing?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a cuddler,\u201d Taehyung grinned. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Jungkook whispered back. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cToo bad,\u201d Taehyung said, and hugged Jungkook tight. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nfrom: tae babe thanks for letting me stay over really\n\nthank you, i had a great time \n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMorning.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was the week of The Party, four days away from doomsday, and Jungkook felt just a little weird entering Taehyung\u2019s office. He had sent Taehyung a message last night with the bold promise of I\u2019ll show up every morning this week as your boyfriend, not a delivery boy, so don\u2019t bother Jiwoo anymore with emails. Taehyung had sent a lovely cluster of heart emojis, and Jungkook\u2019s own heart stupidly stuttered. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBecause of fucking emojis. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBoy, this was getting out of hand, and at this point Jungkook wasn\u2019t sure how he was going to feel about not seeing Taehyung again after Friday. That was the deal after all, and Taehyung hadn\u2019t said anything about change of plans. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, hey baby!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe cheerful tone in Taehyung\u2019s voice made Jungkook realize something was amiss. His eyes had only zoned in on his fake boyfriend behind his desk, so he hadn\u2019t realized someone else was in the room; a tall man dressed in a silken shirt, bright trousers and an extravagant fur coat. His hair was a pretty shade of blondish pink, and his features positively striking. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs this a bad time?\u201d Jungkook asked, slowly, staying close to the door. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, no, absolutely not!\u201d Taehyung smiled, but there was a slight, distinct panic in his eyes. \u201cThis is my brother, Seokjin. He just returned from his Milan trip!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nOh.  \n\n\u00a0\n\nOh shit. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Jungkook exclaimed. Holy shit what was he supposed to say? \n\n\u00a0\n\nMake Taehyung proud, you nitwit, his brain helpfully supplied. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLovely to meet you, Seokjin. It\u2019s a pleasure. I\u2019m Taehyung\u2019s boyfriend, Jeon Jungkook,\u201d Jungkook said, a little too quickly, but at least he didn\u2019t stutter. He hurriedly placed the coffee on Taehyung\u2019s table, wiped his hand on his pants and held it out for Taehyung\u2019s brother to take. Seokjin\u2019s smile was Colgate-commercial worthy. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat a sweet boy,\u201d he crooned, and instead of taking Jungkook\u2019s hand, Seokjin leaned in and kissed both his cheeks in greeting. Jungkook was a little stunned. \u201cAw, you\u2019re definitely Taetae\u2019s type! So cute! You did well on this one, little brother.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nUh. Jungkook wasn\u2019t sure what to say at that. He looked over his shoulder to Taehyung, whose face was a bright pink. \u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung said, looking up to meet Jungkook\u2019s eyes. \u201cJungkook is pretty great.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nBa-bump. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMh, he seems very nice,\u201d Seokjin said, devious smile on his face. \u201cWell \u2014 I do need to get to a meeting, it\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m here at this godforsaken hour, so I suppose I should leave you two alone. I believe we will see each other again this Friday, Jeon Jungkook? We\u2019ll talk a lot more then.\u201d The way he stared straight at Jungkook was a little unnerving, even if there was a smile on his face. Seokjin was officially more intimidating than Taehyung had ever been. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook gulped. \u201cY-yes, sir. S-see you on Friday, sir.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nSeokjin winked. \u201cCiao.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Seokjin closed the door behind him, Taehyung let out a long sigh of relief, slumping back in his chair. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d he whispered after an excruciating minute. \u201cWe did it. I think we fooled him.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy are we whispering?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe could still be listening. Actually \u2014\u201d Taehyung hurriedly stood up from his seat and made his way towards Jungkook at an incredible speed; he threw his arms around Jungkook\u2019s shoulders, putting his whole weight on the younger and leaning down until their mouths were nearly touching. \u201cKiss me.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhy, Jungkook should have asked, and a week ago he would have. He was sure Taehyung only wanted Jungkook to kiss him because Seokjin might come back, but Jungkook didn\u2019t care. He just wanted an excuse to kiss Taehyung, and if Taehyung was presenting him with one Jungkook wasn\u2019t going to back down. He\u2019d thought about it ever since Taehyung slept over. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung's lips were just as soft as Jungkook remembered, sugary and sweet and addictive. He wasted no time pressing against the older, cupping Taehyung's face in his hands tilting his head for a better angle. Taehyung audibly sighed against his mouth. Maybe that was supposed to a sign of yeah, okay, that's good for now delivery boy, but Jungkook had no plans on stopping at that, even if their kisses up until now had been mostly innocent. He hadn't been reliving his embarrassing wet dreams from his teenage years the whole weekend to stop at a few pecks, no sir. If Kim Seokjin walked back through those doors within the next five minutes he was going to actually interrupt something. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook rubbed his thumbs over Taehyung's soft cheeks, tilted his head and pried Taehyung's lips open with his tongue; he received minimal resistance, Taehyung's tall height practically melting over him at the action. Taehyung responded eagerly, warm mouth and tongue moving skillfully over Jungkook's own, hands fretting over Jungkook's shoulders, chest and nape, as if he didn't know where he wanted to touch first.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey only realized they were moving when the back of Taehyung\u2019s thighs hit his office desk, and Jungkook wasted no time hoisting his fake-boyfriend onto the surface of the table. Taehyung let out a small squeak of surprise, breaking away from Jungkook's lips. \"This is an expensive desk, Jeon Jungkook, I'd rather we didn't -\" \n\n\u00a0\n\nParting Taehyung's long legs, Jungkook stepped between them and wrapped his arms around Taehyung's midsection. The words died on Taehyung's lips immediately. \"I - uh, Jungkook -\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Less talking, more making out,\" Jungkook whispered, pressing his mouth to the column of Taehyung's throat this time. \"I've wanted to kiss you again since we went out with Jimin and the others \u2014 fuck, you\u2019re hot.\u201d Jungkook probably shouldn\u2019t have admitted to that, but, oh well.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Really?\" Taehyung breathed, fingers curling into Jungkook's hair. \"This is quite a new side of you, baby, I haven't seen you like this b-before - oh.\" He sucked in a deep breath as Jungkook pressed wet kisses under his ear. \"I like it. I like it a lot.\" \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"You do?\" Jungkook voiced, pulling away to meet Taehyung's eyes; they were dark with intent and his lips were red and spit-slicked. \"I thought -\" Jungkook rubbed a thumb over Taehyung's lips, bit his own bottom lip when Taehyung's tongue peeked out to lick at it, \"- you would like being - in control?\" \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"In any other situation except the bedroom, yes,\" Taehyung replied, cocking his head to the side with a mockingly innocent-looking smile. \"So - you going to kiss me again, baby?\" \n\n\u00a0\n\nJeongguk nodded enthusiastically, diving in for another kiss with a grin on his face, voice at the back of his head playfully telling him it seemed like Seokjin wasn't coming back. That they were alone in Taehyung's office, making out, and he was between Taehyung's legs. Not to mention the fact that Taehyung seemed to want this just as much as Jungkook did, and that possibility had Jungkook a little dizzy. \n\n\u00a0\n\nEventually, it wasn't Kim Seokjin that forced them to pull apart and get back to reality, but rather a phone call from an angry-sounding Jiwoo reminding Jungkook of his next job. At that point Taehyung seemed like he was trying to pull Jungkook's shirt off, so honestly it was just shitty timing. Or fantastic timing, considering the fact that this was not a part of their agreement and could very well turn everything on its head. But Jungkook did groan loudly in protest as his ringtone blasted through Taehyung's minimalistic office. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I'm on my way,\" Jungkook told Jiwoo, even though he still had Taehyung's hand under his shirt and glossy lips on his throat. \"I'll be there in time, no worry.\" \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Don't screw it up,\" Jiwoo grunted before hanging up. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook sighed, regretfully stepping away from between Taehyung's legs. He immediately missed the heat of the older's body, but - he had work to do. As much as he liked being in Taehyung\u2019s presence he had a job, and they had been scarily scarce recently. \"Sorry,\" he mumbled, as Taehyung let out a small sound of protest, hands grabbing after Jungkook. \"I really need to go, I have more work today than expected. Jiwoo's keeping me busy.\" \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung huffed, leaning back on his hands. He looked ridiculously good where he was sitting on his own desk with his thighs spread apart and lips bitten red and hair mussed up. It was positively a crime leaving him. \"Hm, well, I'm busy too.\" \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Yeah. Well,\" Jungkook hesitated, straightening his shirt and pulling a hand through his hair. He wasn't sure how presentable he looked at the moment. \"Did you,\" Jungkook lowered his voice, \"did you think your brother would come back? Uh \u2014 is that why you let me kiss you like that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung's whole face turned red, and suddenly he was looking away, avoiding Jungkook\u2019s eyes actively. \u201cUh \u2014 yeah, of course,\u201d he said, but his whole body language told Jungkook he was lying. Jungkook didn\u2019t mention anything about it, however. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was reading this all wrong. \u201cYou should get going, then, delivery boy.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nDelivery boy. The sudden change of nicknames was a little baffling, because Taehyung had called him baby for days now. Did he do something wrong? Oh, dear, Taehyung was regretting it, wasn\u2019t he? Was he creating distance between them on purpose? Fuck, did Jungkook fuck up? Or was Taehyung just teasing him? Jungkook couldn\u2019t tell.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung didn\u2019t seem to notice that Jungkook was panicking, having hopped down from the desk and seated himself in his office chair. \u201cHey \u2014 I\u2019ll stop by your place tomorrow after work,\u201d he said, still not looking in Jungkook\u2019s direction. \u201cI got you a suit for the launch party.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cY-you did?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMhm.\u201d Taehyung nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to show up tomorrow morning, but I\u2019ll probably need to make adjustments to it, so I need your measurements. Are you free?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUh \u2014 yeah.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d Finally, he looked up and met Jungkook\u2019s eyes, face a mask of nonchalance, like they hadn\u2019t just been heavily making out. Like they hadn\u2019t gotten much closer this week. Fuck. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Bye.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook\u2019s mouth was suddenly very dry. \u201cBye.\u201d His voice cracked a little. \n\n\u00a0\n\nShit. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe last time Taehyung had been to his place he had been slightly buzzed, happy and clingy. When Taehyung knocked on Jungkook\u2019s door the following Tuesday, he was very much in work mode, and Jungkook was hit with the dread of holy shit we really fucked up. Jungkook knew they had been moving in the right direction, with the teasing and kissing and civil conversations, but suddenly it was like they were back at square one. \n\n\u00a0\n\nExcept instead of always being mildly annoyed by Taehyung, Jungkook looked at him and felt all warm inside. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAn inconvenient development, truly. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it a little too much? You \u2014\u201d Jungkook paused as Taehyung put the clothes bag on his couch with the utmost care, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have gotten me a suit.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cConsider it repayment for having had to hang out with me for three weeks,\u201d Taehyung said dismissively. He zipped the bag open. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing all too fancy, so don\u2019t worry. You can pull of a simple suit with your good looks. Besides \u2014 \u201d he looked over his shoulder briefly, sent Jungkook a small wink, \u201cI still need to be the best-looking. The attention needs to be on me at all times.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s attention is always on you,\u201d Jungkook said, because honestly he couldn\u2019t imagine Taehyung walking into a room and not having all eyes on him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung hummed. \u201cYours, too?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung stood up straight and looked at Jungkook a little too seriously. He had taken his heels off by the front door and was only a tiny centimeter taller than Jungkook now. \u201cYou answered that too fast for someone who\u2019s only my fake boyfriend, delivery boy,\u201d Taehyung said, frowning. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOw. That stings. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 you\u2019re the one who told met treat this as a real relationship, Tae \u2014 Taehyung.\u201d Jungkook cleared his throat. If Taehyung wasn\u2019t using nicknames and pet names anymore, then Jungkook shouldn\u2019t either, right? \u201cYou\u2019re sending mixed signals, suddenly. The deal isn\u2019t over until after the launch party, right?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhy was he rambling all of a sudden? It wasn\u2019t like Jungkook to let his mouth run, but Taehyung\u2019s behavior was bothering him more than he\u2019d like to admit. \u201cYou\u2019re paying me to act like your boyfriend, and you\u2019re telling me to really commit, but when I do you suddenly start acting weird \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI \u2014 you \u2014\u201d spluttering, Taehyung hurriedly avoided Jungkook\u2019s eyes, \u201cI asked you to act as my boyfriend around people, not to make out with me to that extent \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who asked me to do that too, though.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe Jungkook hadn\u2019t protested to making out with him, but Taehyung had definitely asked first. Taehyung couldn\u2019t exactly say Jungkook was at fault in this situation, not when he so clearly remembered the older whispering \u201ckiss me\u201d into his ear. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou did.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nPressing his lips into a tight line, Taehyung crossed his arms over his chest and turned away from Jungkook. \u201cWhatever. Just \u2014 just get undressed, and try on the suit. I\u2019m busy, I don\u2019t have the whole day to do this, especially not if I have to get it fitted for you.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou said you liked it,\u201d Jungkook mumbled, not letting it go, because Taehyung\u2019s mood swings were annoying him at this point. He\u2019d said he enjoyed it when Jungkook had taken control of their kiss, told him to do it again, but now he was acting like he\u2019d never wanted it to happen. Jungkook called bullshit. If anything, he had a feeling Taehyung was a little attracted to him physically. There had to be a reason for his sudden hostility, at least. \u201cIf you regret it that much,\u201d Jungkook continued, \u201cthen okay. Now we know where to draw the line.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nNot really okay. Jungkook had liked the idea of Taehyung enjoying kissing him. It gave him a little hope. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHope for\u2026 a little more. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhich was stupid, because in what world would someone as beautiful and successful as Taehyung actually date a delivery boy with tattoos and no college education? He was wondering if it was even a good idea to introduce him to Taehyung\u2019s family. Even if it was just for show Jungkook wasn\u2019t really someone who fit into their world. \n\n\u00a0\n\nYeah, it was probably for the better that him and Taehyung weren\u2019t really dating. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Jungkook mumbled, moving to pull his sweater over his head. If Taehyung was going to be an asshole about this, then the faster they got this over with, the better. It was probably for the best, anyway \u2014 Jungkook\u2019s stupid developing feelings were going to get in the way after the launch party if Taehyung said he wanted more. Jungkook was probably just reading into the situation too much; Taehyung had certainly just been caught up in the moment, right? \n\n\u00a0\n\nYeah, probably. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI just \u2014\u201d Jungkook continued, discarding his sweater to the floor, \u201c\u2014 you shouldn\u2019t have asked me to treat this as a real relationship if you were not able to handle it. That\u2019s all. You\u2019re just making this annoyingly awkward.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung\u2019s lips were pressed into a tight line as Jungkook turned to look at him, his ears read and jaw clenched. Jungkook had probably said something wrong, as usual; he certainly wouldn\u2019t put it past himself. Not that Jungkook wanted to anger Taehyung in any way \u2014 not now, when he was slowly coming to terms with his fucking feelings \u2014 but perhaps it was for the better. They were toeing over the line, and Jungkook was aware that he himself would not be able to get over Taehyung quickly if this\u2026 affair of theirs got a little more passionate. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making this awkward?\u201d Taehyung hissed through gritted teeth. He approached Jungkook, narrowed his eyes and jabbed a manicured finger into Jungkook\u2019s very naked chest. \u201cNeed I remind you that I was the one who had to take initiative for you to even consider holding my hand? You\u2019re the very definition of awkward! Your fucking picture is next to the word in the fucking dictionary!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Jungkook seethed right back, already tired of Taehyung\u2019s excuses and insults. He was getting a little too defensive for Jungkook\u2019s taste. \u201cYou wanted this, you told me to act like we were really in a relationship, so honestly I do not understand why you are upset with me when you\u2019re just continuously contradicting your own words. You\u2019re the one paying for this whole ordeal, so tell me \u2014 what the fuck do you want?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nIn an ideal scenario, Taehyung would have said \u2018you\u2019 and then proceed to grab Jungkook\u2019s face and kiss him silly. Jungkook knew he was a bit of a romantic, and maybe he let himself hope, because Taehyung turning around with a huff hurt a little more than he\u2019d expected. \u201cForget it. I was caught off guard by how passionate you were, and it was confusing me,\u201d Taehyung said, quickly. \u201cIt would just be a real bother if you really started to like me, is all. Wouldn\u2019t want that to happen. Just \u2014 let\u2019s just stick to holding hands and hugging. That\u2019s enough for the public.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nBoom. There is was. The remainder of Jungkook\u2019s hope \u2014 why had he let himself hope? \u2014 dwindled. He hurriedly schooled his (probably crestfallen) expression in case Taehyung decided to turn to look at him again. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDon\u2019t let him know, don\u2019t let him know, don\u2019t let him know. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou flatter yourself,\u201d Jungkook voiced. \u201cI have better standards than that.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung snorted, not even looking away from what he was doing. He\u2019d brought a big handbag with him, and was pulling out a long measuring band and a notepad. \u201cYeah, okay. You seemed plenty eager when making out with me, though. It\u2019s understandable that I\u2019d come to that conclusion.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who said you liked it, so what does that make you?\u201d Taehyung\u2019s shoulders tensed, and he didn\u2019t reply; Jungkook was sure there was something else going on, but Taehyung was too stubborn to admit it and Jungkook had no energy left. He was tired and his heart was a little broken. \u201cWhatever. What do you want me to say? You\u2019re attractive, you know that. Maybe if you\u2019d dress up that personality of yours as well as you make yourself pretty every morning, boyfriends would stop leaving you.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nAt that, Taehyung finally turned around. \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n Yeah. That was an asshole thing to say. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re still a bitch.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nScoffing, Taehyung rolled his eyes. \u201cRight. Bubblegum bitch. That\u2019s what you called me, wasn\u2019t it? On your phone?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook frowned, genuinely surprised Taehyung knew about that. Yes, Jungkook named him that after their first meetings, but he hadn\u2019t referred to him with that name to anyone else. \u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat day, in the caf\u00e9,\u201d Taehyung started, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cI sent the photos we\u2019d taken via message and you left your phone on the table when you went to the bathroom. I happened to see the name you\u2019d saved my number under. Thanks for that, Jeon.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was a joke,\u201d Jungkook found himself saying, \u201cdon\u2019t take it seriously.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou still mean it,\u201d Taehyung seethed. \u201cJust say it, whatever you want. You\u2019re a bitch, and that\u2019s all there is too you under those clothes. Too bad you were given that face when you can\u2019t make anyone like you. Well, at least you\u2019re rich, Kim Taehyung.\u201d Taehyung\u2019s voice grew angrier as he spoke, and \u2014 to Jungkook\u2019s horror \u2014 his eyes grew glassy as well. \u201cCome on, say it. I\u2019ve heard all of it before, Jungkook! You\u2019re not even my real fucking boyfriend, you\u2019re not allowed to hurt me!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook wanted to comfort Taehyung, he really did, but at this point he just seemed angry and it didn\u2019t seem like he wanted Jungkook anywhere near him. Jungkook wasn\u2019t sure what he was supposed to say. \u201cJust \u2014 let\u2019s just get this over with, Taehyung.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nYeah, okay. Probably not that. \n\n\u00a0\n\nFuck you, Taehyung muttered under his breath, rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand. Jungkook wasn\u2019t really grasping the situation, but he realized he must have really hurt Taehyung if he was on the verge of really crying. He felt like garbage, and his heart was screaming at him to move forward and engulf Taehyung into a hug and make it all better. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBut his mind was tactfully reminding him to stay away. That this would make it easier for him on Friday. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSo as Taehyung dried his tears and started getting to work on actually measuring Jungkook, Jungkook kept quiet. He stood as still as possible, listening to Taehyung\u2019s directions as he told Jungkook to lift his arms, straighten his back and the like. It was a short process, one that probably wouldn\u2019t have been painful at all if they had just kept their mouths shut to begin with. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWell, Jungkook thought as Taehyung left his apartment, fuming, that went horribly. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nto: tae babe i already changed your name on my phone it hasn\u2019t been like that since we went out with jimin\n\u00a0\nfrom: tae babe you changed it to something worse?  to: tae babe no\njust taehyung \n\nfrom: tae babe\n\n\n okay, don\u2019t care \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n . \n\n\u00a0\n\n . \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe launch party was quickly approaching, and Jungkook could feel himself dreading it more than he\u2019d ever done when he woke up on Friday morning. It hit him, that after today \u2014 after the party \u2014 he\u2019d have no reason to step into Bangtan Magazine\u2019s offices with Taehyung\u2019s vanilla soy latte. There would be no reason for them to meet up and take cute pictures, hug and kiss. \n\n\u00a0\n\nFuck. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook had stopped by the offices yesterday to pick up the suit on Taehyung\u2019s request, perfectly tailored. According to Taehyung he didn\u2019t have to alter it much, his \u2018genius\u2019 having been able to pretty much determine Jungkook\u2019s size. Jungkook would say he was impressed, but it was just a suit. A nice one, probably expensive, but it would look bland next to Taehyung anyway. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhich was probably a good thing, because Taehyung mentioned there would be paparazzi at this event, and even celebrities. He supposed Taehyung\u2019s family was technically celebrities in their own field, but Jungkook had been shaking ever since Taehyung mentioned how IU went to their runway show once. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung had been right, however \u2014 he did look very good in the suit. It wasn\u2019t something extravagant, but then again that wasn\u2019t really Jungkook, either. He prided himself in being able to pull of a simple outfit, and the tie brought a little more pizzazz to the black. It had a slightly familiar pattern, reminding Jungkook of Taehyung\u2019s intricate suits, and Taehyung had off-handedly mentioned that Jungkook\u2019s tie would match his own jacket. \u201cBecause we\u2019re a couple,\u201d he\u2019d said, monotonously. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWell, they were supposed to be a couple, but with how things had been between them these past days Jungkook wasn\u2019t sure they would be able to bring it to the Actual Show. He told himself it was now or never, because he wouldn\u2019t have a chance at being close to his (very unfortunate) crush again. The launch party was his excuse to indulge in the fantasy of dating Taehyung a little longer, but with how upset Taehyung was at him right now Jungkook wasn\u2019t sure if he dared. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hadn\u2019t even dared going to Bangtan Magazine to give him his coffee this morning. He\u2019d chickened out at the bottom of the elevator, pushed the vanilla soy latte into Min Yoongi\u2019s hands and quickly excused himself. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSorry I wasn\u2019t there to give you coffee, I had work at Jimin\u2019s, Jungkook sent via message as excuse, and it wasn\u2019t technically a lie. He did have work at Jimin\u2019s, but he\u2019d had time to give Taehyung his coffee yesterday morning and picked up the suit while doing so, so Taehyung probably knew he was bullshitting. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe didn\u2019t get a reply anyway. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was less than an hour before the launch party even started that Taehyung finally contacted Jungkook, telling him \u201cyou better be ready\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m picking you up in five minutes\u201d. Jungkook was ready, having struggled with his tie for almost fifteen minutes and another twenty getting his hair presentable. Jimin said he looked ready to rock (sigh) and gave him thumbs up, but Jimin didn\u2019t work for a fashion magazine. For all Jungkook knew he looked like a walking disaster. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung arrived down the road to Jungkook\u2019s neighborhood in his fancy-ass car, car sticking out like a sore thumb. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Hey,\" Jungkook said as he carefully slid into the car. Taehyung had given him these pointy-toes shiny shoes to wear as well, and he had been scared to even put them on. Pair that with the suit, tie and Taehyung's fancy vehicle, and you had a Jeon Jungkook on the edge. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Hey,\" Taehyung replied, eyes scanning over Jungkook. He was dressed in a deep purple suit, the jacket embroidered with floral patterns matching the ones on Jungkook's tie. His pants were one color, a slightly darker purple, slim fit all the way down to his legs, where - \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook frowned. Taehyung wasn't wearing heels. He was wearing a similar pair of dress shoes to Jungkook\u2019s instead, and Jungkook\u2019s first thought was that it looked odd. There was no polish on his nails, either, he had simple rings in his ears, and he was wearing a minimal amount of makeup. No gloss, no eyeliner, no glitter on his cheeks. \"Why - why are you dressed like that?\" Jungkook asked, genuinely worried. \"Why do you look like that, Taehyung?\" The only times Taehyung had worn flat shoes around him was when they had planned on walking over a longer period of time. Taehyung loved his heels, and he made sure to tell Jungkook how expensive they were every time they met. Why the hell was he wearing a pair of simple formal shoes at an event like this? \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Look like what?\" Taehyung asked, rolling his expensive car back onto the main road. He stared straight ahead, jaw set. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"You - you look so... not you?\" \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung gave him a brief look. Pressed his lips into a line. He was chewing gum, at least; the sugary smell in the car assured Jungkook this was still the same Kim Taehyung. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\"It's easier this way,\" Taehyung eventually said.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"What... do you mean?\" Jungkook asked, slowly. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung shook his head. \u201dYou know people judge. You've seen it yourself when we have been hanging out together,\" Taehyung started, frown on his lips. Jungkook briefly remembered judging stares and snide remarks, but he also remembered Taehyung not acting bothered by it at all. \"Not even the fashion industry is that accepting yet. My family doesn't mind how I dress, not at all, but the world does. They wrote lots of articles about me last time I showed up at a public event in heels and full makeup, I'd rather not have my brother's launch party ruined because of that.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"That...\" Jungkook paused. It didn\u2019t sound right. \"Okay. If you say so.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not \u2014 I would wear my usual stuff, but it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s Seokjin\u2019s party, not mine, I don\u2019t want to take the focus off him. As much as I\u2019m saying I want all the attention on me \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI get that, but \u2014\u201d Jungkook paused, tried finding the right words, \u201cshouldn\u2019t you wear what you want, still? Like \u2014 shouldn\u2019t you be happy what you wear all the time?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung spluttered. \u201cY-yes, but \u2014 ugh, just, don\u2019t argue with me on this one, Jungkook. I\u2019m \u2014 I don\u2019t have time to change \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWould your brother care?\u201d Jungkook cut him off. \u201cIf you showed up wearing your heels and makeup?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re being insufferable.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just asking.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung barely looked away from the road to give Jungkook a small glare. Then he pouted. \u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he finally said, voice barely above whisper. \u201cI don\u2019t think. I just \u2014 people are going to ask enough with me bringing you there, I wouldn\u2019t want you getting unwanted attention either, and \u2014 I just thought it was for the best, okay? There will be reporters and representatives from other magazines and I\u2019m just\u2026 nervous.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung did actually look a little nervous where he was sitting, staring straight onto the road with his bottom lip between his teeth; Jungkook was hit with the sudden urge to comfort.\u00a0 He tryingly patted Taehyung\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHey \u2014 sorry if it seemed like I was pressuring you. You should do what you want, obviously. It\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s decision but yours.\u201d Taehyung briefly glanced at him, lips pursed. \u201cIf you feel comfortable going to the launch party like this I\u2019m not stopping you. I was just trying to understand why, okay?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nSighing, Taehyung suddenly switched lanes, driving onto the intersection leading towards Gangnam. Jungkook was pretty sure that was not where the launch party was to be (Taehyung had mentioned it was held around Dongdaemun, in the fashion district). \u201cWell then, you persuasive little shit,\u201d Taehyung muttered as he gripped the steering wheel tight, \u201cI sure hope you\u2019re ready to wait for another hour. We\u2019re gonna me late.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFashionably late?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung glared. \u201cToo late.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung drove them to an apartment complex in Apgujeon, a district Jungkook hardly went to, much less imagined hanging around in. It was definitely in the wealthiest part of Gangnam; Jungkook felt himself shrinking in his seat as Taehyung drove into the parking house the gigantic building he called home. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWith little time, Taehyung ushered Jungkook out of the car as soon as they\u2019d parked and towards the elevators. Jungkook watched in awe as Taehyung pressed the penthouse button and leaned back agains the mirrors, checking his wrist for the time. \u201cWe can just aim for making it to the runway show, and Seokjin\u2019s showcase,\u201d Taehyung said. \u201cThe mingling in the beginning isn\u2019t the important, anyway, though I\u2019m sure my brother will give me hell for it.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll understand, probably,\u201d Jungkook said, \u201cjust say we got caught up.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCaught up,\u201d Taehyung repeated, sarcastically. \u201cAnd what, exactly, would we be caught up in, baby?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cExactly what you\u2019d expect, Tae,\u201d Jungkook grunted, crossing his arms over his chest. He tried avoiding Taehyung\u2019s eyes, but their gazes met in the elevator\u2019s mirror. Taehyung quirked one brow at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d Jungkook spluttered. \u201cYou honestly think your brother doesn\u2019t expect you to have sex?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung let out a mocking gasp. \u201cOh my, such crude words, my darling!\u201d he exclaimed, bringing a hand to his chest. \u201cWhatever happened to my pure boyfriend? My boring vanilla man?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nPure. Jungkook snorted. He knew Taehyung was teasing him, so he couldn\u2019t really be mad; not when the light banter was a welcome change from how hostile they\u2019d been to each other lately. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be saying that if we were really dating, Mr. Fashion Editor.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHm,\u201d Taehyung hummed as the elevator dinged open, signalizing their arrival on the penthouse floor. \u201cI can believe that.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook didn\u2019t want to think too much about what that meant. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to laugh.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook looked up from his phone screen as Taehyung stuck his head into the walk-in closet. He looked a bit more like himself already, with the shimmer on his cheeks and eyes rimmed with glittery eyeshadow. Taehyung had already been running around in his room for 40 minutes, mumbling curses \u2014 mostly directed at Jungkook \u2014 while searching through his belongings. Jungkook had never even seen a closet that big and fancy, much less that amount of clothing, but Taehyung seemed to know where everything was. It even had a small leather couch (Taehyung had placed him there with a small glass of expensive-looking wine and told him to \u201cbe good\u201d) as well as a minibar. In other words; Jungkook could have lived there. \n\n\u00a0\n\n(But he was done living in a closet, obviously.)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy would I laugh?\u201d Jungkook asked, taking a sip of the wine. He wasn\u2019t really a wine person, but this particular one was good. It probably also cost more than his entire monthly salary. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust \u2014 I don\u2019t know, you might not like it. Not that it matters, I think I\u2019ll wear it anyway. Unless you think it\u2019s too weird \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you look great.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung snorted. \u201cOf course I look great, I always do.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThen what\u2019s the hold up? You said we were late.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung grimaced, sighed, and then stepped out. \n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, Jungkook would like to say he was a strong man in the face of beautiful men, but he\u2019d lost the battle with Kim Taehyung as soon as they met. When Taehyung came into full view Jungkook actually choked, which was fucking pathetic, but could you blame him? Taehyung was dressed in this thin-looking, cream-colored silk shirt that seemed to constantly want to slip off both his shoulders at the same time; his wide-legged pants were sat high on his hips and had large splits on the sides, all the way up to his thigh, so when Taehyung shifted the weight on his feet and moved his leg out, all Jungkook could see was golden tan skin. On his feet were the tallest pair of heels Jungkook had ever seen him wear \u2014 probably closer to fifteen centimeters \u2014 and Jungkook knew he would be the perfect height to hug.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook gulped, audibly. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOh boy. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh. Wow,\u201d Jungkook uttered. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s it look?\u201d Taehyung asked, doing a quick twirl in his ridiculously tall heels. The look on his face was clearly expectant. \u201cWell?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook didn\u2019t feel like he could even find words to describe how good Taehyung looked. He couldn\u2019t even believe someone as beautiful as this wanted to fake date him. \u201cI mean \u2014 I \u2014\u201d Jungkook cleared his throat, put the glass of wine down on the small table next to the leather couch. He stood up from his seat, slowly, and took a few steps towards the older. \u201cYou look\u2026 stunning.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFlatterer,\u201d Taehyung said, lips quirking into a small smile. It looked surprisingly shy. He approached Jungkook with confident strides however, and before Jungkook knew it, Taehyung had thrown his arms around him; he made a lot of noise while doing so, wrists heavily adorned with jewelry. Man, he was a lot taller than Jungkook in those heels. \u201cYou really think I look good?\u201d Taehyung continued. \u201cGood enough to be on your arm tonight?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI mean \u2014\u201d Jungkook cleared his throat and slowly slipped his arms around Taehyung\u2019s waist. His mind was screaming at him not to, to make distance, because there was still no one here to act for, but Jungkook justified it to himself that it was practice. Warm up. \u201cI think I\u2019ll look awfully dull next to you as always, but that\u2019s nothing new.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung made a protesting sound. \u201cYou don\u2019t look dull, I think you look wonderfully gorgeous. We\u2019ll turn heads, both of us.\u201d He leaned down and pressed a kiss to Jungkook\u2019s cheek, and Jungkook honest-to-god almost squealed. This was the effect fucking Kim Taehyung had on him. \u201cYou look beautiful. We both do.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook tried not to smile too wide. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI do say so, and my words are law,\u201d Taehyung nodded. \u201cNow \u2014 please let go of my waist, villain, as we really do need to leave.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to let go. Maybe I\u2019ll just stay here, all night, hugging you,\u201d Jungkook \u2014 the Idiot\u2122 \u2014 said, hugging Taehyung a little tighter while doing so, and the older tensed in his hold. We\u2019re supposed to be fighting, Jungkook reminded himself, but Taehyung was close and smelled sugary and he looked so beautiful that not flirting didn\u2019t seem like an option.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou trying to get in my pants before we break up tonight, Jeon Jungkook?\u201d Taehyung asked, cocking his head to the side.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook looked up at him, lifting one brow at the challenging expression on Taehyung\u2019s face. Slowly, without breaking eye contact, he trailed his hand down Taehyung\u2019s waist and down his hips and thighs, towards the slits in his pants. Taehyung seemed to tense even more, hands moving to Jungkook\u2019s shoulders, and then to the nape of his neck. \u201cI mean \u2014\u201d Jungkook started, blood ringing in his ears and he slipped a hand under the fabric of the pants, \u201cthere isn\u2019t much pants to get into, babe.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung was peering down at him, bottom lip between his teeth, and in any situation where Jungkook wasn\u2019t fully aware of how fake their relationship was, and how hurt he was going to be when Taehyung said goodbye to him later, he would have pushed Taehyung against the closest wall and kiss him hard; he\u2019d probably hoist Taehyung up, wrap his long legs around him, hold him close and suck marks onto his pretty skin, because honestly, as beautiful as Taehyung looked in these clothes the thing Jungkook wanted most was to get Taehyung out of them. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDon\u2019t, Jungkook. Don\u2019t do it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook was weak, he really was. One second longer of Taehyung staring at him with hooded eyes, and he\u2019d probably snap. \n\n\u00a0\n\nInstead he managed to look away, remove his hand from under Taehyung\u2019s pants, and gave his (admittedly very nice) butt a light slap. Taehyung made a startled sound. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m done playing. Let\u2019s leave. We shouldn\u2019t be too late.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung\u2019s mouth dropped open just a little, and Jungkook enjoyed the surprised look on his face a little too much, probably. \u201cYou\u2019re a tease, what the fuck.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook grinned. \u201cYou really wanted to make that excuse a reality, huh? I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll even get to the launch party at all, then, Taehyung, if you wanted to sleep with me first.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nSpluttering, Taehyung pushed Jungkook away. \u201cI do not \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook rolled his eyes lightly. Here they go again. \u201cYes, Taehyung, I know. We already argued about this. I\u2019m not your type, you don\u2019t like me, this is all because you want to prove a point to your coworkers \u2014 got it.\u201d He sighed, gathered the jacket he\u2019d taken off while waiting for Taehyung to get ready. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to fight, Taehyung, and if you want to make this believable, I don\u2019t think we should be either. So let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s just enjoy ourselves today, yeah? Take your own advice \u2014 don\u2019t think about it too much.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Taehyung snapped. \u201cSorry, then. We\u2019ll \u2014 let\u2019s go all out, yeah? Make them all think we\u2019re a super gross obnoxious couple?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Jungkook coughed. \u201cI mean, we already managed to fool Jimin. He thinks we\u2019re gross and cute, apparently. So \u2014 I think we can manage one more time.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d The smile on Taehyung\u2019s face looked surprisingly genuine. Jungkook assumed he was happy to know they had fooled someone. \u201cJimin thought we were cute together?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook nodded, gave a slight sound of confirmation. \u201cYeah. He thinks we\u2019re cute.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are,\u201d Taehyung agreed, and, well, Jungkook could get behind that. They would have looked really cute together; Jungkook had a whole folder of nice photos him and Taehyung had taken for Evidence, to show they were really an item, and \u2014 well, they looked great. They looked like a couple. \n\n\u00a0\n\nLinking their arms together, Taehyung pressed up against Jungkook again, leaned down, and gave Jungkook a small, sticky kiss at the corner of his mouth. \u201cLet\u2019s go, baby,\u201d he said, and Jungkook could feel his heart beating fast and hard in his chest. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe launch party was held in a nice, fancy complex in Dongdaemun, and it wasn\u2019t really as extravagant as Jungkook had expected. There weren\u2019t any photographers waiting outside, no chaos, and no nationwide famous celebrities; instead there was a large amount of well-dressed people mingling and drinking champagne, soft music playing in the background, and a multitude of fashion spreads on the walls. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was a relief, honestly. Jungkook had already had nightmares about flashing cameras for about a week.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMost reporters here have been invited here by my brother himself,\u201d Taehyung informed as he led Jungkook inside the welcoming hall. No one seemed remotely interested in them arriving a little late, carrying on with their conversations. \u201cSeokjin hates the stress of having to talk to too many people at once, so this is honestly a pretty private affair. It might not seem like it, since so many people are attending \u2014\u201d Taehyung skillfully grabbed two glasses of champagne from a passing waiter, \u201c\u2014 but this would have been a much bigger party if it was mine.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, you seem like the type to throw extravagant parties. Thanks.\u201d The champagne tasted a little sweet. Bubbly. Jungkook linked arms with Taehyung again, because even if he wasn\u2019t in full panic mode, he felt a lot better with Taehyung at his side. \u201cI don\u2019t look completely out of place, right?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hoped he didn\u2019t. The suit didn\u2019t look any different from what other people were wearing, and covered most of his tattoos except the ones on his right hand and fingers, but Jungkook was scared he just looked\u2026 awkward. That it seemed too obvious he didn\u2019t belong. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You look exactly like every other dude dressed in Armani on this party.\u201d Jungkook took a small look at his suit. Armani. Okay, he was certainly going to be more careful from now on. He should probably have checked the tag on the jacket. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Jungkook mumbled, moving his arm around Taehyung\u2019s waist, \u201cevery other dude in Armani on this party isn\u2019t being accompanied by the most beautiful man on the planet, though.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, wow,\u201d Taehyung said, throwing a small look in Jungkook\u2019s direction that he didn\u2019t really know what meant. \u201cThat was smooth as fuck. What happened to my awkward boyfriend?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou like the compliments,\u201d Jungkook excused. \u201cI\u2019m just stating the facts, babe.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 keep them coming.\u201d Taehyung grinned, but there was something about his smile that didn\u2019t completely reach his eyes. He lifted his glass, clinked it against Jungkook\u2019s, and then almost downed the whole drink. Jungkook supposed something was wrong but \u2014 he didn\u2019t want to ask. This was certainly not the place for them to talk; they had a relationship to fake. Jungkook could ask later. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOr not. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, Taehyung!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe slightly familiar voice of Kim Seokjin rang across the room, and turned his head to see Taehyung\u2019s older brother come towards them with a large, pink-lipped smile. The sequins on his jacket nearly blinded Jungkook. \u201cYou made it! You guys are pretty late, you know?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry, hyung,\u201d Taehyung grinned. \u201cWe got caught up.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nAha. Caught up. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSeokjin lifted one eyebrow. \u201cCaught up, you say?\u201d His eyes moved from Taehyung towards Jungkook, and Jungkook tried his best not to shrink in his position. \u201cI see. Lover-boy can\u2019t keep his hands to himself, huh?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook spluttered, tried hiding a little behind Taehyung as if that was going to help him in this situation. Seokjin and Taehyung apparently both thought it was hilarious. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, didn\u2019t mean to assume,\u201d Seokjin said, the lilt in his voice definitely insinuating that he assumed something; but that was the point, obviously. \u201cIt\u2019s nice seeing you again, Jungkook. Glad you didn\u2019t get cold feet about coming here, I know it may be a lot to take in.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah it\u2019s \u2014 nothing like I\u2019ve ever been to before, that\u2019s true. Uhh \u2014 congratulations, on\u2026 all of this?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung snorted next to him, and Seokjin also looked pretty amused. \u201cThank you, Jungkook. And thank you for coming, despite this being somewhat out of your comfort zone. Don\u2019t worry too much and just stay close to Taehyung and you should be just fine \u2014 now.\u201d Seokjin clapped his hands together. \u201cI believe I have to mingle, I promised a few news sites some small interviews. Runway starts in thirty minutes, don\u2019t be late for that!\u201d With a small wink in Taehyung\u2019s direction and a pat on Jungkook\u2019s shoulder, Seokjin walked away in his shiny, sequined jacket, and Jungkook let out a small breath of relief. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat was quick and painless,\u201d Taehyung said, sounding reassured as well. He moved his arm, trailed his hand down to link his and Jungkook\u2019s fingers together. \u201cWant to just get it over with? I saw my mother over by the refreshments, so my father shouldn\u2019t be too far away either. Let\u2019s just \u2014 get it out of the way? Rip it off, quickly, like a band-aid.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt dawned on Jungkook then, that Taehyung must have been just as nervous as him \u2014 if not more. In the end this was his family they were trying to fool, and if everything went to hell Taehyung was the one who had to live with the consequences. If Jungkook fucked up, sure he\u2019d feel pretty embarrassed about it, but then he wasn\u2019t going to see them again. Taehyung was the one who would get the short end of the stick if this didn\u2019t work out. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, really \u2014 Jungkook should just do his best. For Taehyung\u2019s sake. Even if it was going to hurt like a bitch when Taehyung waved him goodbye in approximately two hours. He was going to make sure Taehyung\u2019s parents thought he was the nicest fucking boyfriend Taehyung ever had \u2014 much better than those stupid model boys. \n\n\u00a0\n\nNodding, Jungkook clutched Taehyung\u2019s hand a little tighter. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung\u2019s mother, Kim Taemi, was a model-turned-actress who apparently had a good number of popular dramas back in the 80\u2019s, before retiring from the big screen to work with her new husband on his fashion magazine. Her husband, Kim Seokho, had been a pretty famous shoes designer before deciding to start Bangtan Magazine; he was a lot kinder-looking than Jungkook had expected \u2014 they both were, honestly \u2014 but maybe Jungkook had just been watching too much Ugly Betty. Taehyung had assured him since the beginning that they were very nice people \u2014 just very busy \u2014 and it was obvious. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTaehyung has talked lots about you,\u201d Kim Taemi said, her lips stretched into a smile that reminded Jungkook a lot of Taehyung\u2019s. She was a beautiful woman, and looked far too young to have two sons in their later twenties; her black hair was in a nice up-do and she was dressed in a gorgeous royal blue pants suit. Taehyung looked a lot like her. \u201cWouldn\u2019t shut up about you when we met at lunch yesterday. Jungkook this and Jungkook that.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung grumbled from the side. \u201cThanks, mom.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very flattering,\u201d Jungkook said, shooting a small look in Taehyung\u2019s direction. \u201cI hope you\u2019re saying nice things about me, though.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHuh? You saying you have nice sides about you, Mr. Jeon?\u201d Taehyung teased, tilting his head to the side. \u201cI have yet to see them.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook grimaced, letting his arm travel around Taehyung\u2019s waist to pinch his side. Taehyung let out an honest-to-God squeaky giggle and Jungkook was so far gone. What a fucking cutie. There the hell was bubblegum bitch? Where was the asshole Jungkook had met in studio 3 who had ordered him around like some dog? \u201cOf course I\u2019ve only said nice things about you, baby,\u201d Taehyung smiled, and when Jungkook saw how fondly Taehyung\u2019s parents were looking at them both he felt bad. Damn, they were swallowing it up. Jungkook imagined it had a lot to do with Taehyung sending photos of them both and talking about Jungkook even before meeting him, but damn. \n\n\u00a0\n\nGod he felt bad. He just didn\u2019t know what was more upsetting; the fact that Taehyung\u2019s parents seemed to genuinely believe they were together, or the fact that they weren\u2019t. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAvoiding the gazes of the parents, Jungkook turned to Taehyung, who leaned down and pressed his forehead against Jungkook\u2019s. It was too cute, Jungkook honestly felt like his whole face was going to burn up when Taehyung bumped their noses together and grinned with his whole face. Jungkook suddenly wanted to be far away from all of this, preferably in Taehyung\u2019s or his own apartment, where he could have pulled Taehyung in and kissed him like he deserved to be kissed. He couldn\u2019t exactly do that here, with reporters mingling amongst the well-dressed upper class \u2014 much less in front of Taehyung\u2019s parents \u2014 so Jungkook settled for smiling back and pecking Taehyung\u2019s nose before pulling away.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sad I can\u2019t take you out on a dinner, Jungkook,\u201d Kim Taemi sighed, shaking her head. \u201cWe would have loved to have taken you guys somewhere a little more private than this whole affair and have a nice meal and talk more, but we\u2019re all very busy people, yeah? We\u2019re leaving right after the runway, too.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nHer husband nodded. \u201cYes, our plane leaves a little after midnight, so we need to get to the airport in time,\u201d he said, \u201cwe barely made it here this week, but I\u2019m glad we managed to at least meet the boy Taehyung has been talking so much about. We\u2019re afraid he\u2019s overworking himself, you know, he\u2019s so dedicated, and we\u2019re hardly ever in the country to support him.\u201d With a fatherly smile, he raised his hand and ruffled Taehyung\u2019s bangs with his fingers, much to his son\u2019s protest. \u201cIt\u2019s good that he has someone around that can take care of him a little. His brother is here, obviously, but with the launch of his clothing line Seokjin will be traveling even more too.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDad \u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re scared he\u2019s getting lonely here in the big city,\u201d Taemi continued, and Jungkook heard Taehyung groan audibly. \u201cHe\u2019s been living in Daegu most of his life with his grandparents, you know, so we were a little surprised he wanted to move to the Seoul branch by himself. But \u2014\u201d she smiled, in such a motherly way it nearly made Jungkook a little homesick, \u201c\u2014 you know how stubborn he is. What Taehyung wants, Taehyung gets.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung grumbled. \u201cYou make me sound like a spoiled brat.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a little bit of a spoiled brat,\u201d his dad quipped, and Jungkook snorted unattractively. \u201cBut you\u2019re our spoiled brat.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaemi made a sound of agreement, while Taehyung nearly rolled his eyes back into his head. His ears were tipped red. Jungkook was having the time of his life, seeing Taehyung speechless like this. \u201cPoint is,\u201d Seokho continued, \u201cwe\u2019re glad he has someone to spend time with. And we wish we could have gotten to be here longer to get to know you better too, Jungkook, and thank you properly for making our son smile so much.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey were giving him too much credit. It\u2019s not like Taehyung was lonely and unhappy without a boyfriend; in fact, judging by the previous idiots he\u2019d dated, Taehyung was doing well on his own. Jungkook couldn\u2019t even say in confidence that he made Taehyung happy, because for all he knew Taehyung was just doing his very best to convince his parents they were in a relationship. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBut one thing was certain; Taehyung made Jungkook happy. Sad, too, obviously, knowing this was going to end soon, but Taehyung draping himself all over Jungkook, kissing him, hugging him and teasing him, made Jungkook smile wider than he\u2019d done in a long time. \u201cWell, sir,\u201d Jungkook started, \u201cthe feelings are mutual. We both take care of each other and make each other happy, so \u2014 honestly, Taehyung is great. Thank you for, you know, your support. I hope you\u2019re okay with me dating your son for a while. As long as he doesn\u2019t get tired of me, of course.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s yours,\u201d Taemi said, at the same time as Taehyung squeezed Jungkook\u2019s upper arm a little too hard. \u201cTake him forever, please!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nForever. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung sucked in a very audible breath as his mother said that. Jungkook shot him a small look, squeezed his hip. \u201cI do wish we had better time,\u201d Seokho said again, looking dejectedly at the clock on his wrist, \u201cbut the runway is about to start, too. It\u2019s unfortunate our first meeting is cut so short, but \u2014 perhaps we can find time to meet later this year?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d Taehyung said, possibly a little too fast. Suddenly he was busy looking anywhere but his parents.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis winter, perhaps?\u201d Taehyung\u2019s mother looked hopeful, and Jungkook stuttered. Shit, this probably wasn\u2019t in the plan. Were they that convincing that Taehyung\u2019s parents believed they would stay together for a very long time? \u201cWe have a vacation house in Hainan, that shouldn\u2019t be too far for you guys to travel. That would be very nice.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, when the time comes,\u201d Taehyung hastily smiled. \u201cI mean \u2014 we don\u2019t know how busy either of us will be around next summer, so let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. You guys might visit before then. Ah \u2014 the runway should be starting soon.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung was fretting. He was nervous, shifting the weight on his heels, and he pulled away from Jungkook\u2019s grasp to run a hand through his blond hair. His mother eyed him with a little suspicion. \u201cTaehyung? You alright, sweetie?\u201d she asked, that Concerned Mom-expression in place. Taehyung looked very distressed, Jungkook would agree, like he was about to pass out any moment. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll \u2014 uhh,\u201d Jungkook put a hand on the small of Taehyung\u2019s back, \u201cI\u2019ll take him outside for a moment, have him get some fresh air. That okay, babe?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung nodded, curtly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKim Taemi frowned. \u201cOkay, sweetie. But \u2014 the runway starts very soon so make sure you\u2019re in place by then, okay? Be there to support your brother, he worked very hard for this.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nBoth nodding, Jungkook started leading Taehyung towards the exit of the complex, the older not protesting the slightest at the hand on his back. As soon as they were outside, Taehyung grabbed Jungkook by the arm and dragged him aside, farther away from the entrance, towards a brightly-lit fountain. Then he stopped, turned to face Jungkook and said, eyes wild, \u201cI can\u2019t fucking do this.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jungkook voiced, raising one eyebrow. \u201cYou can\u2019t do what?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung gestured wildly around them. \u201cThis! All of it! You \u2014 they fucking love you!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook was genuinely confused here, mind you. This made zero sense to him. \u201cYeah, I guess? Was that not the point? We were supposed to be believable, right?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBelievable, yes,\u201d Taehyung hissed, \u201cbut you\u2019re acting like a fucking heaven-sent son-in-law!\u201d He placed his hands on his hips, leaned down a little to get more on eye-level with Jungkook. \u201cYou\u2019re making this ten times more difficult for me! I\u2019m the one who has to drop the news that we've broken up in two weeks time, and they\u2019re actually going to be sad about it! \u2018Oh, we take care of each other and make each other happy\u2019. What sort of sappy ass shit was that!?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook schooled his expression into one of nonchalance, despite feeling anger and hurt bubble under his skin. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it again,\u201d he said, a little surprised at how low his own voice was. \u201cYou\u2019re contradicting yourself.\u201d He looked around them, making sure no one was nearby, but still lowered his voice even more, to a mere whisper. \u201cDo I need to remind you you\u2019re paying me for this, still? My business is for tonight \u2014 and tonight only. What happens after is your fucking problem, Kim Taehyung.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe Jungkook was being a little harsh again, but Taehyung had no right to say that Jungkook was doing anything wrong at this point. He was doing exactly what Taehyung had asked him to do in the e-mail: act like a loving boyfriend to fool his family into thinking they were actually dating. He wasn\u2019t crossing any line, not really, because what happened after this night was over was not something Jungkook should be concerned about. Sure, he was a little scared at the fallout of this, but it wasn\u2019t supposed to have anything to do with him. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlso,\u201d Jungkook continued, gulping, \u201cthat sappy shit came straight from the fucking heart, Taehyung. You might not want to admit it, but this whole thing has been kind of fun, and I\u2019ve enjoyed myself in your company.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung looked doubtful. \u201cYou\u2026 enjoy my company?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Jungkook snorted. \u201cOf course I was just going along with what a good boyfriend would have said in that situation,\u201d he lied (because Taehyung genuinely made him happy), \u201cbut it\u2019s not like it came from a completely baseless place. The stripping job was still worse than this.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung bit back a smile, but somehow he still looked upset. Jungkook wasn\u2019t sure what he was supposed to fix this situation, because it seemed like Taehyung just\u2026 didn\u2019t want to continue. \u201cIf\u2026\u201d Jungkook started, \u201cif you really don\u2019t want me here \u2014\u201d his heart dropped a little at the thought of saying goodbye a few hours too early, \u201c\u2014 I can just leave. You can tell everyone I got a sudden phonemail for a job, or something. But \u2014 you still kind of have to pay me.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Taehyung shook his head, quickly. \u201cFuck \u2014 I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m being a bitch again, I didn\u2019t \u2014 you\u2019re just\u2026 you\u2019re just so much better at acting than I thought you would be. It\u2019s\u2026 throwing me off.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s because I\u2019m not acting, Jungkook thought, sadly, because fuck, he was a horrible actor. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was just so, helplessly smitten. He was falling stupidly in love with Kim Taehyung; diving headfirst, even, and at this point all he could do was enjoy the time they had left together and hope that he would get over Taehyung, eventually. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook shrugged, once again trying very hard to look completely unaffected. His heart was beating loudly in his chest. \u201cGuess I got used to it. Didn\u2019t want you to leave a bad review on my website, either, when all of this is over. Need to do a good job, you know, no matter how awkward was in the beginning.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nAt this, Taehyung smiled for real. \u201cYeah, okay. I\u2019ll make sure to leave a very nice review for you. 8/10.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Jungkook said, pulling an affronted face, \u201cwhat exactly is pulling my grade down?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou horrible kissing,\u201d Taehyung teased, smirk sliding onto his face. Then he walked forward, bumped his shoulder with Jungkook\u2019s, and headed back towards the fashion complex, heels clicking against the ground. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHorrible kissing,\u201d Jungkook repeated, looking after Taehyung, mouth dropping open. \u201cWho \u2014 what \u2014 who are you kidding here, Kim Taehyung? I\u2019m a fantastic kisser, and you know it! You can\u2019t fool me, you think I\u2019m an excellent kisser!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKeep telling yourself that, darling!\u201d Taehyung shouted back. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIf this was a nighttime drama, this was the part where Jungkook would run up to Taehyung, grab his arm, turn him around and kiss him. Prove to Taehyung \u2014 or at least remind him \u2014 what a great kisser he is. However \u2014 this wasn\u2019t a drama. Jungkook knew that kissing Taehyung at this point would probably only make him more upset, and he didn\u2019t want to deal with that. He just wanted to stay close to the older and enjoy his company one last time, even if he was itching to say something. Anything. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an ass,\u201d Jungkook said as he jogged up to Taehyung\u2019s side and grabbed his hand. \u201cAnd a horrible boyfriend.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung threw his head back and laughed, and Jungkook thought, God, I could stare at him the whole day if it was socially acceptable and not very creepy. \u201cWell, just wait a little more, and you\u2019re a single man again, Jungkook. About \u2014- an hour and a half until we can break up.\u201d He winked as the automatic doors to the complex opened and they walked back into the hall. The words were like a punch to Jungkook\u2019s gut. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n Oh.  \n\n\u00a0\n\nOh no, Jungkook said that out loud. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung\u2019s head whipped around, and Jungkook stopped dead in his tracks; Taehyung pulled his hand to his chest, as if Jungkook\u2019s skin suddenly burned him. Shit, Jungkook had really gone ahead and dropped the bomb like that, could he really not have waited just a little longer? Could he not just have kept his mouth shut? \u201cW-what?\u201d Taehyung uttered, voice sounding uncharacteristically weak. \u201cWhat\u2026 did you say?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKim Taehyung!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nA tall fellow approached them, suddenly, panting. His arrival immediately cut off any chance of them talking this out at the moment, and Jungkook praised the heavens for the timely intervention. Jungkook spared the new arrival a brief look, recognized him as Kim Namjoon \u2014 the sole reason he and Taehyung even met in the first place. If Kim Namjoon hadn\u2019t ordered those 33 vegetarian sandwiches and had Jungkook deliver them to studio 3 that very day, Jungkook and Taehyung would never have met. At this point Jungkook wasn\u2019t sure if Namjoon was someone he should thank or curse. Not with the way Taehyung was looking at him, as if his whole world had just crashed around him. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTaehyung \u2014 the show is starting,\u201d Kim Namjoon said, looking between the two of them from behind his thick-rimmed glasses. \u201cThe doors are closing, so we need to \u2014 are you coming?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung swallowed. \u201cY\u2014yeah. I\u2019m coming. Jungkook \u2014 uhh \u2014 come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook had half expected Taehyung to just tell him to leave, cut this whole thing short and send Jungkook away. It would have made sense if he did, because Jungkook had suddenly dropped a I wanna date you for real bomb and distance would have been the most obvious option. Instead, Taehyung took Jungkook\u2019s hand again \u2014 it was a little clammy, and Jungkook though it looked like Taehyung\u2019s shoulders were shaking \u2014 and dragged them towards where the runway was supposed to be. \n\n\u00a0\n\nNamjoon followed them both, but all of Jungkook\u2019s attention was on Taehyung and how warm his hand was. It was a bit of a blur as Taehyung pulled him along past rows of occupied seats and made Jungkook sit down on a less-than-comfortable chair, right in front of a long, brightly lit stage. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung placed his chin on Jungkook\u2019s shoulder, and whispered a short, \u201cwe need to talk. After this.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook gulped. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOh boy. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nIt felt like forever until Seokjin finally stepped on stage after the show with a microphone and thanked everyone for coming. Jungkook\u2019s eyes were watering at that point, and he wasn\u2019t sure if it was because he was dreading the talk he needed to have with Taehyung or because of the flash photography going off around him. It hadn\u2019t been obvious how many journalists and photographers had been present in the welcoming hall, but now Jungkook felt like they were everywhere. It put him a little on the edge, especially with the way Taehyung was still holding his hand. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWe need to talk, Taehyung had said, but Jungkook knew they couldn\u2019t talk here. Not with Taehyung\u2019s co-workers around them, not with the journalist from a rivaling magazine sitting right next to them both. Min Yoongi was also seated right across the stage from them, and Jungkook might have shared slightly uncomfortable eye-contact with him a few times. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to your place,\u201d Taehyung said when people started moving and it seemed like he couldn\u2019t stand up from hie seat fast enough. He pulled Jungkook up with him, serious expression on his face, and Jungkook didn\u2019t feel like he could protest. \u201cLet\u2019s move before I\u2019m stopped for some bullshit interview. The reporter behind me kept tapping my shoulder the whole fucking runway.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook mumbled, looking around them both. Part of him wanted to stall the inevitable talk they were supposed to have, because honestly he didn\u2019t know what Taehyung was going to say. How harshly was Jungkook about to be rejected? \u201cAre you sure, though? Won\u2019t your brother want you to stay behind?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung shook his head. \u201cSeokjin can manage on his own. He\u2019s not dependent on me, I\u2019m still kind of convinced he just wanted me here to rub his success in my face.\u201d Jungkook wanted to say that probably wasn\u2019t the case, but he didn\u2019t know enough about Taehyung and Seokjin\u2019s relationship to do so. It was obvious Taehyung was a little upset about not getting the Chief Editor position, despite having said he wasn\u2019t, so Jungkook wasn\u2019t going to assume. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy my place?\u201d Jungkook asked. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBecause I need that suit back.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nAh. More rejection. If they went to Taehyung\u2019s place, Jungkook could easily have borrowed something from his gigantic closet to wear. The future was looking bleak indeed, and Jungkook\u2019s remaining hope was dwindling. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSigh. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHurry, Jeon! Kim Heechul is moving in this direction\u00a0and if he gets his claws in me we\u2019re not leaving until morning.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Taehyung said hurry he meant let\u2019s fucking zoom out of this place. Jungkook barely managed to say a hello to Yoongi as they passed him, Taehyung swiftly maneuvering them both through the suddenly bustling\u00a0crowd. Luckily Seokjin was busy with a whole pack of hungry reporters, so he didn\u2019t spot them as Taehyung led Jungkook out of the complex. It was a swift, mostly painless exit, though Jungkook felt like his arm was going to fall off with the force Taehyung was pulling it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAs they slid into Taehyung\u2019s car, the silence finally caught up to them, and it dawned on Jungkook that, fuck, now they had to talk. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBut Jungkook was not going to open his mouth first. Hell no. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNot gonna say anything?\u201d Taehyung asked as he started the engine. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook huffed and childishly crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cYou wanted to talk.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to talk?\u201d Taehyung spoke, shooting a quick glance in Jungkook\u2019s direction. Taehyung was obviously focused on safely getting out of the parking lot, but his knuckles were white from how hard he was gripping the steering wheel. \u201cMr. I-don\u2019t-want-to-break-up? Newsflash, Jungkook: we weren\u2019t even dating in the first place.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook hurriedly looked out of the window, chewing his bottom lip between his teeth. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that? You made sure to remind me every time I got a little too close.\u201d He sank into the seat, sadness welling over him suddenly. Don\u2019t cry, Jungkook. Don\u2019t you dare cry, you big baby. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t feel real, sometimes.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell \u2014\u201d Jungkook could hear Taehyung shift a little in his seat, \u201c\u2014 I admit it felt real, at times, but \u2014 you \u2014\u201d he paused, hesitated; \u201cyou said you were just following fucking orders. That you were doing this because I\u2019m paying you. That\u2019s what you\u2019ve been saying all along, Jungkook, how dare you suddenly change your mind \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou think I suddenly changed my mind?\u201d Jungkook snorted. \u201cI\u2019ve been slowly falling for you over the course of these weeks, knowing you didn\u2019t want anything to do with me as soon as this was over. I was just supposed to be another one of your asshole boyfriends, but then I got invested, and I started getting to know you and \u2014 fuck.\u201d Yeah, okay, the moisture was definitely gathering in his eyes at this point. \u201cYou know how beautiful and charming you are, Kim Taehyung. You really expected me not to fall head over heels?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung stuttered, which definitely wasn\u2019t a regular occurrence. \u201cI \u2014 you \u2014 I thought you were just acting \u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a horrible actor.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Taehyung mumbled, \u201cthat stuff you said \u2014 about me making you happy? Was\u2026 was that true, then?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nAt that Jungkook might actually have had to choke back a sob. \u201cYeah,\u201d he croaked out, pressing his forehead against the cool glass window. Stop crying, he told himself as the stupid tears rolled down his cheeks. Oh dear God, you\u2019re pathetic, Jeon, it\u2019s just one guy. A stupid crush. \n\n\u00a0\n\nExcept maybe it wasn\u2019t. Jungkook hadn\u2019t allowed himself to think too much about it, but even Taehyung\u2019s parents seemed to think they could have stayed together for a long time. Of course he was going to fantasize a little.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe silence then\u00a0stretched out for a good fifteen minutes, neither of them saying a word as Taehyung drove in the direction of Jungkook\u2019s apartment. Jungkook wasn\u2019t sure what more he was supposed to say, because honestly he\u2019d laid himself bare at this point. Taehyung knew now, and honestly there was nothing Jungkook could do to change it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe second Taehyung\u2019s car stopped outside Jungkook\u2019s apartment complex, Jungkook opened the door and tailed out of the car. Taehyung shouted after him, but Jungkook just slammed the door closed and paced towards the entrance, drying his eyes hurriedly. Yes, Jungkook cried a lot when he got upset, sue him. He was a fucking ugly crier. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, bastard!\u201d Taehyung\u2019s voice rang after him. \u201cAre you seriously going to make me run after you in heels!?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook stalled in front of the entrance door, hearing Taehyung slam the door to the driver\u2019s side shut and approach him with fast, clicking steps. \u201cYou can just wait o-outside,\u201d Jungkook muttered when he felt Taehyung\u2019s presence behind him, \u201cI\u2019ll just take the suit off and come out with it \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJungkook,\u201d Taehyung sighed, and then he gripped the sleeve of Jungkook\u2019s suit jacket,\u00a0turning him around. Jungkook didn\u2019t have any time to read Taehyung\u2019s expression before the older\u2019s lips was on his, hands cupping Jungkook\u2019s face and body pressing him against the entrance door. The doorknob was jabbing uncomfortably into Jungkook\u2019s back, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care when Taehyung\u2019s kiss made him both so confused and hopeful. Taehyung\u2019s thumbs grazed over Jungkook\u2019s still tear-strained cheeks, and he hummed against the younger\u2019s lips. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Taehyung mumbled, briefly pulling away to press a kiss to Jungkook\u2019s left cheek. \u201cYou crying and everything?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nSniffling, Jungkook rested back against the entrance door, hoping none of his neighbors suddenly decided they\u2019d come through this very moment. \u201cY-yeah,\u201d he voiced in answer to Taehyung\u2019s question. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung pouted, moving his hand to card his fingers through Jungkook\u2019s fringe. \u201cYou \u2014 really like me that much, Jeon Jungkook?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook nodded, weakly. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Taehyung\u2019s ears were turning a little pink; be bit his bottom lip, looked at Jungkook through his lashes; pressed himself a little closer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he mumbled, and Jungkook\u2019s heart stuttered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for pushing you away, I \u2014 I really, honestly thought you were only doing this for the money. I \u2014 you didn\u2019t give me many signs showing you didn\u2019t, and every time I tried to mention something about it you just shut it down.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook spluttered. \u201cWell, you \u2014 it seemed like you really hated the idea of me liking you, so I just\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to get hurt, so I said stupid shit to hurt you instead. I mean, me getting my heart broken was obviously inevitable anyway, because honestly this was bound to happen to one of us. I\u2019ve seen the movies, you know? This is a thing that happens, and I should have known better because you\u2019re\u2026 You\u2019re you. You\u2019re kind of perfect.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung lowered his head. He was blushing furiously at this point, but that was okay, because Jungkook was pretty sure he was as well. \u201cI\u2019m not. Obviously. I mean, you even mentioned that I needed to fix my personality.\u201d Before Jungkook could try and explain that he definitely didn\u2019t mean that, that he just said it because he was mad, Taehyung held up a finger to shush him. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean it, you\u2019re not that much of an asshole. It sure hit home, though.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d Jungkook stressed, \u201cno one is more sorry than me. Sorry, sorry, sorry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShh,\u201d Taehyung silenced him by pressing a manicured finger to Jungkook\u2019s lips. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean it, you dramatic ass. But \u2014 I still thought you didn\u2019t want anything to do with me personally, that you were just sticking with it for the money, because I\u2019ve had those experiences with boys before; they\u2019ve dated me because I have money and contacts and can get them jobs. And you \u2014 you weren\u2019t even really dating me, so why would you actually like me?\u201d Taehyung paused, briefly, took a deep breath before continuing. \u201cAfter Hongdae, with Jimin and Heeyeon and them, I, uhh, it got a little too real. You let me sleep over, and I \u2014 fuck, I thought about you the whole weekend. And then I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you. When you kissed me in my office like that I \u2014 God, I was so close going on my fucking knees for you.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nWell. Jungkook certainly wasn\u2019t expecting those words out of Taehyung\u2019s mouth. The mental image had blood rushing immediately from his face and straight south. \u201cAre you \u2014\u201d Jungkook cleared his throat, his voice embarrassingly high-pitched, \u201c\u2014 what are you saying \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying I like you, Jungkook,\u201d Taehyung said, voice the softest Jungkook had ever heard. He didn\u2019t meet Jungkook\u2019s eyes, fingers playing with the collar of his shirt. Suddenly he looked so small, despite towering over Jungkook in his 7-inch heels. \u201cAnd \u2014 I think you should take responsibility,\u201d he continued, \u201cfor making me fall for your stupid face.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nHonestly, Jungkook didn\u2019t know what he was feeling. Relief? Happiness? He wasn\u2019t sure, but all of it seemed to make him cry even more, and it also made him smile so wide he thought his face was going to split. \u201cAre you crying more?!\u201d Taehyung exclaimed, cupping Jungkook\u2019s face again. \u201cYou crybaby! I sure hope those are happy tears!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook nodded wildly in confirmation, because yes, those were definitely happy tears. Sure, he was still not sure what was happening \u2014 was this even happening, or was he in some sort of dream state? \u2014 but he felt light and content and Taehyung liked him back. Taehyung actually wanted him. He could kiss Taehyung just the way he wanted, now. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo you\u2026 can we maybe go upstairs?\u201d Jungkook asked. \u201cBecause I feel like my neighbors can show up any time now, and we are kind of standing in the way.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung snorted. \u201cSure. I\u2019m not really into being watched, anyway.\u201d Jungkook choked at those words, yet Taehyung only grinned and threw his arms over Jungkook\u2019s shoulders. Leaning down, he pressed a soft kiss to Jungkook\u2019s lips again, and Jungkook let his eyes slide close, wrapping his arms around Taehyung\u2019s midsection as he responded. Kissing Taehyung felt natural, simple, and without the nagging of you guys are not real, he doesn\u2019t like you it was also ten times more enjoyable. \n\n\u00a0\n\nFinishing off with a loud peck to the corner of Jungkook\u2019s mouth, Taehyung pulled away and grinned. \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs, baby. We can talk more and \u2014\u201d Taehyung\u2019s hand gripped Jungkook\u2019s tie, smile turning just a bit smug, \u201cI can even help you out of this suit.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Jungkook breathed. \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThere was little talking. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHonestly, Jungkook was pleasantly surprised they even made it to the bed, because the idea of just bending Taehyung over any piece of furniture sounded more than enjoyable enough. However, Taehyung told him (with a scoff) to, \u201cbe a little romantic, you ass\u201d, so Jungkook navigated them towards the bedroom between heated kisses after a good thirty minutes of making out and grinding. Taehyung had already stripped Jungkook of his jacket and shirt \u2014 honestly Jungkook was a little surprised at how quickly Taehyung could undress someone when it took him ages to put on an outfit \u2014 and was now slowly wriggling out of his sinful pants. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUndress completely, baby, we aren\u2019t wasting any time,\u201d Taehyung breathed. His lips were puffy from how much kissing they had been doing, and he looked flushed and pretty and happy. \u201cThose dress pants are too expensive to fuck in.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nHurriedly following instructions, Jungkook unbuttoned the pants, pulled them down and kicked them away. \u201cHow you wanna do this?\u201d he asked, a little breathlessly, because at this point he wasn\u2019t picky. \u201cWant me to fuck you? Or do you want to fuck me?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBoth are tempting options, baby,\u201d Taehyung grinned as he slowly (and sensually) slid off his silky shirt. \u201cBut I might have fantasized about your dick in me since God knows when. Fuck you\u2019re hot.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Jungkook bit his lip, chest swelling with simple pride. \u201cI can definitely\u00a0help with that fantasy.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMhm. Don\u2019t doubt it baby. You have lube? Condoms?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nBoy did he. Not that he actually used a lot of it, Jungkook\u2019s sex life wasn\u2019t that spectacular; just a one night stand here, maybe a hook-up there. But he always made sure to have it on hand. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, moving towards his drawers to pull out everything necessary to make it as easy as possible. \u201cHey \u2014 question. Or, uh, request.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook gulped as he watched Taehyung lay down on his bed, tan skin a beautiful contrast to his light blue bedsheets. Taehyung sure hadn\u2019t wasted time, having already discarded his underwear as well, and fucking hell, he looked stunning. He was already half hard, his navel piercing was glinting under the soft light of the bedroom lamp, and he was on Jungkook\u2019s bed, completely naked, waiting for him \u2014 fuck. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Taehyung asked, lips quirking into a sly smile. \u201cHow\u2019d you want me, baby? On all fours? Or \u2014\u201d Taehyung slowly parted his legs, \u201cwide open? Like this?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook was pretty sure he was losing years of his life thanks to this man. \u201cJust \u2014 uhh \u2014\u201d Jungkook hesitated, made himself busy finding the lube and condoms. He threw them on the bed, right next to Taehyung. \u201cCould you \u2014 wear your heels?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung\u2019s eyes widened, lips parting slightly in surprise. \u201cYou \u2014 want to fuck me in my heels?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook shrunk a little in his position. But his dick sure didn\u2019t. \u201cM-maybe?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe smile on Taehyung\u2019s face was a mix of surprised and very obviously pleased. \u201cYou kinky little shit,\u201d he voiced, pushing himself up and out of the bed. \u201cWait here for me, baby, I\u2019ll go put them on again.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook didn\u2019t trust his voice to reply, because yes he might have thought about doing it, but he hadn\u2019t actually expected himself to ask. Thankfully, it seemed like Taehyung was up for it, which was honestly the hottest thing ever. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOr, well, Taehyung wearing only his heels, strutting in tall and confident was the hottest thing he\u2019d ever seen. Jungkook was sure he must have saved some kingdom in his past life to be rewarded like this. He could only watch with his mouth hanging open as Taehyung laid back down on bed and rolled onto his stomach. Jungkook\u2019s eyes zoned in on the ink on Taehyung\u2019s lower back, the floral pattern swirling over his skin. \u201cAh, there is that tattoo,\u201d Jungkook said. It was a little tacky, he\u2019d admit that, but he\u2019d definitely seen worse. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh, yes, my college regrets,\u201d Taehyung snorted. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk too much about that and get to the fucking instead. Come on baby \u2014 hurry up.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung \u2014 as Jungkook had learned \u2014 was an impatient person. They had barely made out for a few more minutes before Taehyung grew impatient, picked up a condom and threw it with extreme precision into Jungkook\u2019s forehead. \u201cPrep me, you ass,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cfuck, i want you so bad.\u201d Jungkook was never one to say against Taehyung \u2014 honestly, that\u2019s how he even got into this position to begin with \u2014 so he picked up the bottle of lube and uncapped it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWorking Taehyung open was a painless process \u2014 just tedious \u2014 and Jungkook was sure he could get off by the image of Taehyung rocking against his fingers for years to come. If not the visual, then the sound would certainly also help, because Taehyung was vocal, and the older panting his name and staring up at him with hooded eyes and spit-slicked lips nearly made Jungkook come on the spot. \u201cI\u2019m \u2014 fuck \u2014\u201d Taehyung\u2019s back arched off the bed, and he lifted his legs one of them resting onto Jungkook\u2019s shoulder. \u201cFuck me, Jungkook.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou sure you\u2019re ready?\u201d Jungkook asked, hitching Taehyung\u2019s leg up a little bit further as he pressed forward. He looked ready, but Jungkook just wanted to make sure, because it had been a while and he wanted Taehyung to be comfortable. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m really fucking ready \u2014\u201d Taehyung breathed, whining as Jungkook pulled his fingers out. \u201cShit, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re about to fuck me with that stupid G-Dragon poster staring straight into my soul.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook doubled over laughing, face pressing into Taehyung\u2019s soft stomach and forgetting for a second what they were even doing. Taehyung was shaking underneath him, both with laughter and arousal, and he said, \u201ccome on, I know I\u2019m funny, but please fuck me,\u201d with laughter in his voice. When Jungkook pushed himself back up Taehyung was grinning, wide, cheeks flushed and blond hair spread around his head like a discount halo. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHold your legs up for me, babe,\u201d Jungkook said, and Taehyung did as told, pulling his legs up to his chest, and Jungkook moved forward, holding back a smile. \u201cGood boy.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung groaned. \u201cThat would have been kind of hot if I didn't know you just said that as a GD reference, you stupid little \u2014 ah.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nPushing inside, slowly, Jungkook studied the expression changing on Taehyung\u2019s face. \u201cOkay?\u201d he muttered, and Taehyung nodded, rapidly. Jungkook started with slow, careful movements to get Taehyung used to his size, only bottoming out when the blond uttered a jumbled, \u201cdeeper, baby.\u201d Fuck, it felt so fucking good, Jungkook was honestly surprised he was this controlled in the situation. Taehyung was tight and hot around him, looked like heaven under his body, and with this angle Jungkook could lean down and connect their lips. It was like every wet dream these past weeks had come together and manifested right under him, except it was real. Kim Taehyung was really there, mumbling almost-incoherent demands for Jungkook to fucking fuck him good.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t \u2014 shit \u2014 know you were this flexible,\u201d Jungkook mumbled as he started moving his hips, slowly building his pace. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung stuttered, throwing his head back. \u201cN-neither did I \u2014 ah, fuck, fuck!\u201d Jungkook felt one of the heels scratching at his back as he started thrusting harder, Taehyung\u2019s small curses turning into long-drawn moans. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey didn\u2019t last long, but Jungkook hadn\u2019t exactly expected that either. He fucked Taehyung \u2014 hard \u2014 until he came across his own chest and stomach with a silent scream. Taehyung scrambled at Jungkook\u2019s shoulders when he continued fucking him through his orgasm; with his lips on Taehyung\u2019s neck, Jungkook spilled inside the condom. Taehyung wasted no time pushing him away, forcing Jungkook to pull out, falling back on his ass with an un-sexy grunt. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook tried catching his breath, eyes raking over Taehyung\u2019s body; his thighs were shaking, chest heaving, and he barely moved to kick Jungkook\u2019s side lightly with his heel-clad foot. \u201cF-fuck you,\u201d he muttered, nearly breathless. \u201cI nearly blacked out \u2014 fuck.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d Jungkook panted, pulling the condom off. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cA-fucking-okay,\u201d Taehyung laughed, showing thumbs up. He was still breathing a little hard. \u201cThat was great. Wouldn\u2019t mind making it a thing.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cA regular thing?\u201d Jungkook voiced as he stood up and walked towards the bathroom to discard of the condom. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cA very regular thing,\u201d Taehyung confirmed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook helped Taehyung take off his heels again, put them next to the bedroom door, and then he laid back down into bed. Taehyung immediately latched to his side, a little sweaty and sticky, but Jungkook assumed they could take a shower a little later. When Taehyung felt like it. \u201cWe should probably wash up,\u201d Taehyung mumbled. \u201cUgh, worst part about sex, honestly. Having to wash up. I just wanna cuddle.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll cuddle with you all night,\u201d Jungkook mumbled, throwing his arm around Taehyung. \u201cBut washing up sounds like a good idea.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nTaehyung grumbled, clearly dissatisfied. \u201cYeah. Soon. Just \u2014 five minutes?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook pressed their foreheads together, loving the way Taehyung scrunched his nose up and grinned at the action. \u201cWhatever you want, babe,\u201d Jungkook said, connecting their lips in another kiss far too sweet for their state of undress. Humming against Jungkook\u2019s lips, Taehyung moved his arms around Jungkook\u2019s waist and hugged him tight. Jungkook thought that this was pretty perfect. Sure, they still had things to talk about and work out, but they didn\u2019t have to solve everything immediately. As long as he knew Taehyung liked him \u2014 wanted him \u2014 then Jungkook was content. They could work it out.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCan we make kissing and hugging a regular thing, too?\u201d Taehyung suddenly asked, voice soft. \u201cOr will I need to pay extra?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook rolled his eyes. \u201cJust ask me out like a normal person, Taehyung.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFuck, okay,\u201d Taehyung sighed, moving away to stare Jungkook straight in the eyes. They were so close Jungkook felt like he was going cross-eyed. \u201cJeon Jungkook,\u201d Taehyung started, eyes fond. \u201cBe my boyfriend for real, you lame-ass fashion disaster.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook grinned so hard it hurt. \u201cSure. I\u2019d love to.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(\u201cFuck,\u201d Taehyung said, sitting up in sudden realization. \u201cHoly shit, Jimin is a fucking liar. Boring ass vanilla man my ass!\u201d He stared at Jungkook with narrowed eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re kinky as hell, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook snorted, pulling Taehyung back onto the clean sheets. \u201cHave no idea what you\u2019re talking about, babe. I\u2019m pure. The purest.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou fucked me in my heels, you nasty little\u2014\u201d)\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n"
