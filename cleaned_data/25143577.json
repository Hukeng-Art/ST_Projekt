    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA/N: All right, so first off, HAPPY BIRTHDAY PRESENT MIC!! :D Today, 7/7, is Yamada Hizashi's birthday. So in honor of that, I'm posting a oneshot (even if it's still about Izuku, at least Zashi's still in it. :)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI've had this oneshot written for a bit, actually. It was based off a dream I had, and I thought, \"why not?\" A story that revolves around a PHONE conversation. It was definitely an interesting challenge, and I'm rather happy with how it's turned out. :)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThat being said, I've created a Discord!! :D If you wanna join, this is the link: https://discord.gg/Dz5Er7W\n\n\n\n\nAlso, for my Viridian readers, there's a new animatic!! I'm SO HAPPY!!! Here's the link for that. :3\u00a0\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-8cKsy0dyw\n\n\n\n\nAs always, send any fanart to [email\u00a0protected]. :)\n\n\n\n\nThat being said, please enjoy this oneshot~! And look forward to updates on my other stories. :)\n\n\nMidoriya Izuku was bent over his desk, hard at work on a project. It wasn\u2019t anything overly important, just something to help make his daily life easier. He was a brilliant young boy, despite being Quirkless. Even now, at the tender age of twelve, he had successfully modified his cell phone and its backup battery charger to last more than twice that of the average phone.\nObviously, that meant he could now listen to music all day long without worrying about it dying on him. But wireless earbuds were noticeable, despite his curly hair. He didn\u2019t want to give the teachers any more reason to hate him. Never mind the fact that he was the top of the class.\nHe wanted to be a hero, but he knew that Quirk Analysis skills wouldn\u2019t get him there alone. However, if he could make himself support items to help cover his weaknesses, then it suddenly became a very achievable goal! Even if he had to get into U.A.\u2019s Support Course and use the Sports Festival to transfer to the Hero Course (assuming he failed the Hero Course entrance exam, that is), he\u2019d do it! He would become the world\u2019s first Quirkless Hero!\nBut first, he was going to finish modifying these earbuds so they\u2019d hook around the back of his ear, and use vibrations to bypass the eardrum altogether. That way, he could still hear the teacher if he was called upon, but he could also listen to music in class without looking like it. It was a win-win.\nHe smiled to himself as he hooked it around his ear. Time for a test. He hooked it up to his phone via Bluetooth, and selected a song. He startled badly, nearly falling out of his chair, when the song blasted at full volume. \u201cAH!\u201d He quickly scrambled to turn it down to a more manageable range. Cautiously, he turned the volume back up, and was delighted to hear his favorite music playing. He took it off, and heard nothing.\nIt was perfect! Now his teachers wouldn\u2019t even hear his music playing when the classroom was silent! He put both cuffs on and happily bobbed his head to the music as he checked his reflection. With his curly hair, the dark green cuffs blended in seamlessly. Even Izuku couldn\u2019t see them, plus they were rather comfortable.\nHe grinned as he took a look around his bedroom. In three years, he\u2019d take the U.A. Entrance exams, and he wanted to be as ready as possible. His walls were littered with an odd mixture of hero posters and blueprint designs while his desk was a cluttered mess of different half-finished inventions and support items.\nHis mother had been overly relieved when he took an interest in support items, and happily bought him whatever supplies and tools he needed. He didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that he still wanted to become a hero.\nHe\u2019d come up with a grand variety of things, too. Like the hoverboard (could only hover about a foot above the ground at most, though), his jetpack (which only had a twenty minute battery life with a maximum height of ten feet\u2014he was working on it!) Night vision and infrared goggles (modeled after Eraserhead\u2019s Goggles. Two hour battery life, and he was trying to add a few more features), and his favorite for daily use\u2014his tablet.\nHis tablet looked like a small portable charger at first glance\u2014like a thin palm-sized block of metal. But when it unfolded, it started up the holographic touch screen. He could do just about anything with it, plus it was keyed into his DNA signature. A prick on the finger for a drop of blood and a retina scan was the only thing that could unlock it (and a password, of course. Duh). Call him paranoid, but no inventor wanted their ideas stolen, and Izuku kept a copy of all his blueprints, designs, ideas, and notes on his tablet. It even had voice-activation, too!\nHe sighed and stretched out on his bed. He barely remembered to plug in his phone and new ear cuffs to charge. The cuffs should have a battery life of about 10 hours, while his phone\u2019s battery life with music playing was about fifteen to twenty\u2014plenty long enough for the school day. Plus he had two portable chargers (he kept the phone plugged into one, and it was programmed to activate upon the phone dropping to 20%.)\nIzuku smiled. Life sucked, but at least he had his inventions.\nThe next day dawned bright and crisp. Izuku glared at the cheerful sky with the kind of distaste that only a true night owl could muster.\n\u201cIzuku! Come down for breakfast! Don\u2019t tell me you pulled another all nighter working on your inventions again!\u201d His mother called from the kitchen. Izuku hurriedly pulled on his school uniform, and only barely remembered to slip his phone into the inner pocket of his pants. It was better to keep his valuables hidden where bullies couldn\u2019t get to it, after all.\nHe ate a quick breakfast before rushing out to head off to school. He slipped his ear cuffs on before heading out the door\u2014he didn\u2019t want someone to see them, after all.\nHe warily kept his backpack clutched tightly to his person. For the last few weeks, he\u2019d had the oddest feeling that he was being watched\u2026 or followed. And now, he felt those eyes on him again.\nHe wasn\u2019t sure what to do. It could\u2019ve just been his imagination, or maybe one of his bullies, but somehow this felt\u2026 different. More malevolent somehow. A commotion up ahead had him picking up his pace. A villain fight had broken out, and was taking up the whole street. Onlookers stood idly by, watching the chaos unfold like it was some kind of show. Izuku sort of wanted to join in (because hero fights were cool, even if they were super dangerous), but a glance at the time told him he\u2019d be late if he did. And his teachers had had enough of him being late.\nSo against his better judgment, Izuku took an alternate route to school\u2014through the back alleyways. If he hurried, he could still make it to school before the bell rang.\nAgain, he felt the eyes on him. But\u2026 what if it was nothing? What if it was just his imagination? He picked up his pace, regardless. Better safe than sorry, especially in today\u2019s world.\nHe caught sight of someone in the reflection of one of the abandoned apartment windows. Someone was peeking around the corner of the alleyway he\u2019d just vacated. And they were watching him.\nHe picked up his pace again, and in the next window, he saw the man. He was closer this time.\nShit.\nHe took a deep calming breath. Maybe this guy didn\u2019t mean any harm? No, wait. That was a crowbar in his hand. He was trouble.\nIzuku turned to go back to the main street, only to find the alleyway blocked off by old crates and the like. Izuku wasn\u2019t the fastest climber\u2014if this guy wanted to attack him, he\u2019d be toast. He quickly altered his course again and\u2014\n\u201cJust hold tight, kid. I don\u2019t wanna hurt you.\u201d The man was right behind him.\n\u201cI-I\u2019m just trying to get to school. That\u2019s all.\u201d Izuku raised his hands in a placating manner. \u201cI don\u2019t have any money on me! I swear! If you want my packed lunch, though, you can have it.\u201d Izuku held out his lunchbox.\n\u201cI\u2019m not after your goods, brat. I\u2019m after you.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s stomach dropped like a stone. Shit. He\u2019s gonna kill me. Or kidnap me and sell me on the black market! Or\u2014 He violently cut off his train of thought.\n\u201cY-You want me? I-I don\u2019t even know you! I\u2019ve never seen you before!\u201d\nThe man just grinned. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll never see me again.\u201d He charged, and Izuku tried his best to run\u2014he was very good at that\u2014but the man had some kind of animalistic Quirk. He caught up to Izuku in no time.\nHe felt a sharp pain in the back of his head, and then his world went black.\nIzuku woke up confused and disorientated. He was in a small room. No windows, one door, and bars that kept him from reaching said door. The room looked like an old basement, but there were several cells built into the room\u2014like they were keeping prisoners, and Izuku was one of them. Not only that, but it really stank down there. He gagged at the stench and tried his best to ignore it. There wasn\u2019t enough light to see where it was coming from anyways.\nHe shifted, and his head started pounding. Or maybe he just couldn\u2019t process the light well enough yet.\nHe abruptly recalled the man with the crowbar, and gently touched the back of his head. \u201cOw\u2026 concussion.\u201d He winced at the blood that stuck to his hand. He idly wiped it on his pants, only to feel the familiar square of his phone.\nNo way. He froze. My luck\u2019s not THAT good, is it?! He carefully brought a shaking hand up to his ear, and felt the cuff. A quick double-tap and he heard the familiar ding indicating voice recognition.\n\u201cC-call the police.\u201d He whispered quietly.\n\u201cCalling.\u201d\nNever before had Izuku been more grateful for his inventions.\n\u201cHello, Musutafu Police force, Sansa speaking.\u201d\nIzuku wanted to cry from relief. \u201cH-hi. U-um\u2026 My name is Midoriya Izuku, and I think I\u2019ve just been kidnapped.\u201d His voice sounded a hell of a lot calmer than he felt.\n\u201cKid, I swear if this is a prank\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPlease believe me, it\u2019s not!\u201d He winced as his voice echoed. He lowered his tone just incase someone was nearby. \u201cI was walking to school when this guy attacked me and knocked me over the head with a\u2026 crowbar? And now I\u2019m in some kind of underground holding area, and there\u2019s a cell, and I\u2019m scared.\u201d\nHe heard movement on the other end of the line and some quiet voices before a new voice spoke.\n\u201cMidoriya? My name is Detective Tsukauchi Naomasa. My Quirk is Lie Detection. Can you describe your situation to me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been kidnapped, and have no idea where I am.\u201d He stated.\n\u201cHe\u2019s telling the truth. Start tracing this call, we\u2019ve got a kid in trouble!\u201d He heard Tsukauchi order the other officers. \u201cStay on the phone with me, kid. How old are you?\u201d\n\u201cTwelve. I live in Musutafu, and I think I\u2019ve got a concussion. My head really hurts.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right. You\u2019re lucky your phone wasn\u2019t taken.\u201d\n\u201cI keep it in a hidden pocket on the inside of my pants. I\u2019m an inventor, so I made earbuds that you can\u2019t see. They hook \u2018round the back of the ear. Bypass the eardrum, so there\u2019s no noise.\u201d\n\u201cAny idea why you were kidnapped?\u201d\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\u201cCould it be for your Quirk?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have one, sir. I\u2019m Quirkless.\u201d Izuku paused, cursing himself for revealing that. \u201cY-you\u2026 you\u2019ll still come save me, right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course we will.\u201d He sounded offended.\n\u201cI-I mean, a lot of people don\u2019t care about\u2026 people like me.\u201d\n\u201cKid, listen; you\u2019re in trouble, and it\u2019s my job to help people in trouble, no matter who they are.\u201d He paused a moment while people were talking in the background.\n\u201cSir, the call\u2019s trace is being blocked\u2014it\u2019ll take some time to break through it.\u201d He recognized the voice as the officer who initially answered the phone. What was his name again? Son\u2026 Saun\u2026 Sansa! That was right! Sansa.\n\u201cI want every available man on this.\u201d Izuku felt a few tears run down his face. They were working so hard\u2026 for him? Nobody\u2019s ever done anything for him before.\n\u201cDo you know when you were taken?\u201d Tsukauchi asked.\n\u201cUh\u2026 I was heading to school\u2026 Monday morning. Er\u2026 probably around seven-forty-fiveish? I remember seeing a villain fight on my usual route, and when I checked the clock, it was around 7:45.\u201d Izuku nodded with the information, which made his head hurt. \u201cOw\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u201cI nodded, which hurt my head.\u201d He hissed as he touched the injury again. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s still bleeding or not.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing a good job of staying calm.\u201d He noted. His voice sounded calm and it comforted Izuku quite a bit. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about your family a bit?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s just my mom at home\u2026 I think she\u2019s at work right now. I\u2026 I don\u2019t want to stress her out with this, but I know you have to tell her anyways. Um\u2026 That\u2019s really about it.\u201d\n\u201cAny friends?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m bullied a lot at school. Even the teachers don\u2019t like me. Do you have family?\u201d His face heated up as he realized that it was a very personal question. The detective likely just wanted to keep him talking because falling asleep with a concussion was bad. \u201cS-sorry, I understand if you don\u2019t wanna talk about it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He could hear the detective smile. \u201cI\u2019ve got a baby sister, actually. I live alone, though. Been thinking about getting a dog.\u201d\nHe thought he heard Sansa hiss at that. Was he a cat person?\nIzuku startled when he heard footsteps approaching. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\u201cJust stay on the phone, okay? Don\u2019t talk to me if it\u2019s going to put you in danger.\u201d The detective sounded stern.\n\u201cAh, good. You\u2019re awake.\u201d A new voice greeted. Izuku looked up to observe the newcomer. The man looked to be made of smoke, and wore a fancy suit, like a butler or a bartender.\n\u201cWh-who are you? Where am I?\u201d\n\u201cYou may call me Kurogiri.\u201d Izuku got the impression that the man was smiling. His voice was low and smooth, and it sent shivers down his spine.\nSo this was a real villain.\n\u201cDon\u2019t try anything, kid.\u201d Another unfamiliar voice drew Izuku\u2019s attention to a boy with stringy blue hair and really dry skin. His eyes were a piercing red, and there was something about this newcomer that kept Izuku\u2019s mouth shut. \u201cKurogiri here has a Warp Quirk\u2014he can just send you right back to your cell. The name\u2019s Shigaraki.\u201d He smiled, and picked up a nearby piece of rubble. He held it with four fingers, leading Izuku to believe he had some kind of touch-activated Quirk.\n\u201cIf you try anything\u2026\u201d He grinned and placed his fifth finger on the stone. Izuku watched in horror as it disintegrated. \u201cThat will be you.\u201d\nHe nodded his head in understanding, eyes wide in fear. He could play along for now, and hopefully come out of this mess alive.\n\u201cKurogiri. Sensei\u2019s meeting is taking more time than expected. He\u2019ll evaluate the kid in a few hours.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Shigaraki.\u201d\nWith that, Kurogiri placed a plate of food and a glass of water down inside his cell before locking it back up and leaving the room.\nIzuku was alone again.\n\u201cYou all right, kid?\u201d Tsukauchi\u2019s voice startled him.\n\u201cY-yeah. Just\u2026 there\u2019s something about them that terrifies me. These guys aren\u2019t normal villains.\u201d He felt a strong shudder. \u201cShigaraki\u2026 he can disintegrate things when all five fingers touch something. I really don\u2019t wanna find out what that feels like.\u201d\n\u201cJust hang in there, Midoriya. We\u2019re working as fast as we can.\u201d\nIzuku hoped they\u2019d work faster.\nDetective Tsukauchi Naomasa was having a rather normal day at work, until Sansa busted into his office asking him to authenticate a phone call. It wasn\u2019t unheard of for some kid to prank call them, so they tended to use Naomasa as a way to verify calls.\nHe hadn\u2019t expected it to be an actual call from a kidnapping victim. The fact that it was just a kid?!\nThe more he talked to the boy, the more he felt himself sympathizing with him. This kid was just unlucky, and seemed to have a good heart. He was thankfully calm, and the fact that the villains hadn\u2019t noticed the earbuds (cuffs? Had the kid called them cuffs?) was a godsend.\nIt also was something Tsukauchi had never encountered before. He\u2019d helped kidnapping victims after they\u2019d been rescued\u2014hell, he\u2019d helped rescue them. But he\u2019d never had the opportunity to help a kidnapping victim during a kidnapping. Not like this. It was something that was way out of his comfort zone.\nHe hoped the kid\u2019s battery lasted until they rescued him.\n\u201cHow\u2019s that battery life on your phone, kid?\u201d\n\u201cPretty good.\u201d The kid\u2019s voice was calmer, now. That was good. He didn\u2019t want him to focus on his current situation. \u201cI rigged it to last about twenty hours while playing music, and I\u2019ve also got it hooked up to a battery pack to recharge when it gets low. It\u2019ll probably last a few days on a phone call. The earbuds share the phone\u2019s battery, too.\u201d\nOkay, that was really impressive. \u201cDamn, kid. Mind fixing up my cell phone when you have the chance?\u201d\nMidoriya chuckled, and the sound brought a small smile to his lips. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m sure the earbuds would be useful to the police, too.\u201d\n\u201cYou wanna go into support items?\u201d He asked. The phone was on speaker, so the other cops could hear too. Tsukauchi didn\u2019t notice a dark-haired man enter his office.\n\u201cSort of. I really want to be a hero, but I\u2019m Quirkless. So I figured that my best shot was to get into U.A.\u2019s Support Course and then transfer to the Hero Course using the Sport\u2019s Festival.\u201d\n\u201cTsukauchi?\u201d The detective startled and looked up to see Eraserhead. Maybe that was what they needed on this case? Midoriya had been on the phone with them for a while, now, and they\u2019d hardly made any headway.\nThe kid\u2019s mother had been notified, and was being guarded at home by several members of the police for her safety. Last thing they needed was a villain holding her life over her son\u2019s head.\n\u201cEraserhead.\u201d He greeted, and the kid gasped on the other line.\n\u201cAs in the Underground hero, Eraserhead?!\u201d He could hear the grin in the kid\u2019s voice, and the hero startled.\n\u201cYou a fan, then?\u201d Tsukauchi teased.\n\u201cEraserhead\u2019s my favorite hero! He\u2019s the one who gave me the idea to use support items to become a hero!\u201d\n\u201cIs there a reason why there\u2019s a kid on the phone?\u201d The man did not look amused.\n\u201cEraser, I need your help.\u201d He motioned for Sansa to take over talking with the kid while he pulled Eraserhead outside. \u201cThat kid\u2019s been kidnapped by some nasty villains. Somehow, they missed his phone, and the first thing he did was call us.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re shitting me.\u201d The exhausted man blinked in shock.\n\u201cNot at all. His name\u2019s Midoriya Izuku. Age 12, Quirkless.\u201d\n\u201cIf he\u2019s Quirkless, then why was he taken?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know. He\u2019s encountered two villains so far, Shigaraki and Kurogiri. We\u2019re running their names and the kid\u2019s descriptions through our database while trying to trace the call. So far, no luck.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, so what do you want me to do?\u201d\n\u201cI need to go out and ask a few people some questions\u2014we may have some leads from villains we captured earlier today, but we can\u2019t leave the kid alone.\u201d He sighed.\n\u201cYou want me to sit and talk to a kidnapped child on the phone?\u201d He gave the detective a disbelieving look.\n\u201cSansa needs to work on tracing the call, please? I\u2019ll buy you coffee for a month.\u201d\n\u201cMake it a semester and add in vodka, and you\u2019ve got a deal.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe I have to bribe you with coffee and alcohol.\u201d Tsukauchi sighed. \u201cFine. Deal.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Eraserhead grinned as he re-entered the room with the detective.\n\u201cMidoriya, I\u2019m going to run a few investigations, okay? I\u2019m going to leave Eraserhead here with you.\u201d\n\u201cO-okay. Good luck, Tsukauchi!\u201d The kid sounded unsure, but the detective didn\u2019t have much of a choice.\n\u201cThink of it this way.\u201d He grinned. \u201cYou have your favorite hero all to yourself.\u201d He happily ignored the middle finger Aizawa sent his way.\nAizawa Shouta was not in the mood to deal with children. But he supposed it was better over the phone. At least he could still drink his coffee. And if he was being honest, he was concerned for this kidnapped child. He may not like kids, but he also didn\u2019t want them to be in the hands of villains, either.\nHe didn\u2019t think he was the best at comforting children, though. Why did Tsukauchi do this to him?\n\u201cHey, how\u2019re you hanging in there, kid?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not too good at dealing with children, are you, Eraserhead?\u201d\n\u201cGoddamnit.\u201d He sighed. \u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m not too good at dealing with people. Guess we balance out, then, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d He took a long sip of his coffee. \u201cHow do you know about me?\u201d\n\u201cI love heroes. I want to be one, so I do a lot of research. I specialize in Quirk Analysis and Support Item invention. Since I\u2019m Quirkless, I figured these combined could help me close the gap.\u201d Shouta nodded as the kid spoke. It was logical. \u201cI\u2019ve even done analysis on you.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d He leaned forward, intrigued. \u201cHow good is this analysis of yours?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 well\u2026 I think it\u2019s fair.\u201d\n\u201cHumor me. What\u2019ve you got on me?\u201d\n\u201cErm\u2026 This is off memory, so forgive any mistakes\u2026 You can erase someone else\u2019s Quirk so long as you can keep them in your sights. But when you blink, it deactivates. Oh! And you can\u2019t erase mutant types. Emitter types are easiest for you to erase. Your eyes glow red, and your hair floats\u2014likely a holdover from one of your parents\u2019 Quirks.\u201d Shouta blinked. Accurate. That was a little unnerving. \u201cYou can typically keep your Quirk activated for anywhere from one to three and a half minutes when your eyes are fresh, which is why you carry around eyedrops. The time gradually decreases at a specific rate that I can\u2019t remember right now, but have the equation written down somewhere\u2026\u201d\nThe hero blinked. That was not something you could gather from simple analysis. How much time did this kid spend on this?! But he wasn\u2019t done.\n\u201cUm\u2026 Your fighting style is a mix of about six different kinds of martial arts, with a dash of street fighting mixed in, and you use your Capture Weapon as your primary means of attack. You\u2019re an ambush hero, so you work at night and are really good at stealth\u2014which is shown by how few videos there are of you. You hate the press, and you seem to conserve energy however you can. Uh\u2026 You like cats and seem to have a personal relationship with Present Mic, and you went to school with him, Midnight, Vlad King, and Ingenium. You\u2019re currently a U.A. Teacher, and you hold the record for the most expulsions.\u201d\nShouta stared at the phone in shock.\n\u201cHow the hell did you get all that information on me? How long did that take you to learn?!\u201d He choked out.\n\u201cU-um\u2026 about a month? S-sorry\u2026 I just started rambling\u2026 I\u2026 I really like heroes, and have a lot of free time on my hands.\u201d\nShouta had never met anyone who could tell that much about him before even meeting him. Hell, even some of the people he\u2019d known for years didn\u2019t know as much about him as this kid did. That thought was actually terrifying. Thank god this kid wanted to be on their side. Nezu would love to meet him. \u201cKid, with observational and analytical skills like that, you\u2019ve got a really strong chance of being a hero.\u201d\nThe kid gasped in surprise. \u201cY-You really think so?!\u201d He sounded way too excited. \u201cYou\u2026 do you really think I could be a hero?\u201d\n\u201cLet me guess\u2014you\u2019ve got a technique somewhere in the head of yours on how to take down every hero you\u2019ve ever researched.\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 yes? Villains, too.\u201d\n\u201cThen yes. You can become a hero. That analysis is practically a Quirk in and of itself.\u201d A thought suddenly occurred to him. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s why the Villains took you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never shown anyone my analysis. Even mom doesn\u2019t know\u2014she thinks I gave up on being a hero.\u201d The kid sniffled.\n\u201cAre\u2026 you crying?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy.\u201d He sounded like he was smiling through his tears. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever told me I could become a hero before.\u201d\n\u201cKid whatever you do, don\u2019t let them know about that ability. It\u2019s far too valuable.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\n\u201cHmm\u2026 that analysis of yours\u2026 what can you deduce about the villains that\u2019ve taken you?\u201d\n\u201cI know for a fact that there\u2019s at least three. Kurogiri has a warp quirk, but I haven\u2019t seen it in action. I can\u2019t really deduce anything on that yet. Same with this mysterious \u2018Sensei\u2019 person that I\u2019m supposed to meet soon. I\u2019ve only briefly seen Shigaraki\u2019s Quirk\u2026 it looks like some kind of disintegration Quirk. Needs all five fingers to activate. Drawbacks seem to include extremely dry skin, perhaps dehydration? He didn\u2019t seem to struggle when using it on the rubble, but I\u2019ve little doubt it could work on organic materials, too. Disintegration starts from the point of contact and moves outwards until the object is nothing but dust. He had this look in his eye\u2026 It makes me think of someone really unhinged.\u201d\nShouta quickly got a very detailed mental picture of the villain. \u201cSorry to make you go back to that moment.\u201d He abruptly remembered he was talking to a child, and not a pro.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, really! If I\u2019m going to be a hero, then I need to learn how to handle this sort of thing. Besides, I think my concussion\u2019s getting better. It doesn\u2019t hurt as badly.\u201d\n\u201cBe careful either way. Head injuries are painful and annoying.\u201d\n\u201cRight. I remember the medical textbooks I\u2019ve read.\u201d\n\u201cYou read medical textbooks?\u201d\n\u201cI have a lot of free time.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t most kids hang out with friends?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any friends. I work on inventions, training my body, and training my mind. Sir\u2026 if you don\u2019t mind my asking\u2026 what\u2019s U.A. like?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s big, for one. You won\u2019t really fully understand it until you get there, I think.\u201d He chuckled a bit, remembering his own initial shock at the size of the school. \u201cAnd all the teachers are pros. It\u2019s a good place to learn, and we all do our absolute best to protect our students.\u201d\n\u201cSounds amazing.\u201d He could hear the smile from the kid. \u201cMidnight and Present Mic teach there, right? They\u2019re your good friends.\u201d\nShouta snorted. \u201cMidnight\u2019s a good friend, but\u2026\u201d He smiled. \u201cPresent Mic is my husband.\u201d\nThe kid briefly choked on his spit, and Shouta couldn\u2019t keep the grin off his face. \u201cI knew it! Goddamnit, Kacchan owes me two thousand yen!\u201d He grumbled for a moment. \u201cI used to call Mic\u2019s show all the time when I was little. Back when the show was still new, and there weren\u2019t many people listening. He called me Atlas, because I said it sounded cool.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s talked about Atlas a few times.\u201d Shouta recalled hearing him talking in the late hours of his radio show about the \u2018Little Listener\u2019 and hoping he was okay.\n\u201cR-really?! He remembers me?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Still asks after you, kid. Wonders if you\u2019re doin\u2019 okay. He wanted to know why you stopped calling.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, I realized how many people listened in on the show, and my social anxiety kicked in. I couldn\u2019t really pick up the phone after that. I just followed his radio show instead.\u201d\nShouta\u2019s phone vibrated in his pocket, and he fished it out. \u201cSpeak of the devil\u2014he\u2019s texting me right now.\u201d\n\u201cTell him Atlas says \u2018hi\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d\n\n\nCockatoo: Shouta! I thought you were just dropping some paperwork off at the station, but you\u2019ve been gone forEVER! Are you coming home?!\n\n\n\n\nShouta: No, I got tied up with a new case at the station. Kidnapping. \n\n\n\n\nCockatoo: Oh\u2026 another kid? Those are tough. \n\n\n\n\nShouta: Actually, it\u2019s\u2026 different. Twelve year old kid got taken this morning, but he still has his phone hidden on him. We\u2019re talking to him right now. \n\n\n\n\nCockatoo: Y-you\u2019re shitting me! So we know where he is?!\n\n\n\n\nShouta: Tracer\u2019s being blocked. We\u2019re doing what we can. Oh, remember Atlas, that caller you talk about from time to time? \n\n\n\n\nCockatoo: Yeah\u2026 \n\n\n\n\nShouta: It\u2019s him. The kidnapped kid is Atlas. \n\n\n\n\nCockatoo: \u2026. Hold on, I\u2019m coming down.\n\n\n\n\nShouta: Wait, what?! I thought you had shit to do today!\n\n\n\n\nCockatoo: Grading papers can wait! My Little Listener\u2019s in trouble!\n\n\n\u201cWell, it looks like he\u2019s still rather attached to you.\u201d Shouta spoke aloud. \u201cTold him you were in trouble, and now Mic\u2019s on his way to the station.\u201d\n\u201cH-he really remembers?!\u201d The kid sounded so surprised and awed that it made Shouta\u2019s heart ache just a little. \u201cI\u2026 is my mom okay?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s just fine. We\u2019ve got some heroes and police watching her for you. The villains won\u2019t touch her.\u201d\nHe heard the kid sigh in relief. A few minutes of idle conversation later, and Hizashi came into the room.\n\u201cLittle Listener?\u201d He asked, looking at the phone. Shouta smiled and gave him a kiss on the cheek.\n\u201cP-Present Mic!\u201d Midoriya\u2019s smile was audible.\n\u201cAtlas! Long time no hear! I\u2019ve missed you! I got so worried when you stopped calling!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry! I just got so nervous when I realized how many people would hear me talk, and I just\u2026 chickened out.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019ve got yourself in a real pickle, now, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d The kid chuckled, and Shouta let out a sigh of relief. Hizashi was so much better at this sort of thing than he was.\n\u201cTell ya what? When we bust you outta there, how about you guest star on my radio show? You can come with me to the radio station and we can do it in person together!\u201d\nThey heard a sharp intake of breath. \u201cY-You mean it?! Really?! I canactuallymeetyouinperson?!OhmygodthisisincredibleandthatwouldmeanthatIcanmeetEraserheadtoo,becauseyou\u2019rebothmarriedandsoofcoursehe\u2019dprobablybearoundsomewhere,andIcan\u2019tbelievethis!Icanactuallymeettwoofmyalltimefavoriteheroes!\u201d\n\u201cI see you\u2019ve still got an incredible lung capacity!\u201d Hizashi laughed, and the kid shut his mouth with a snap.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cNo! Don\u2019t apologize! I love it!\u201d Hizashi grinned.\n\u201cIt just means that your mind is sharper than your mental filter.\u201d Shouta sighed, scratching his stubble. \u201cHappens to plenty of people. Bit of meditation should help. I\u2019ll show you some techniques later.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll teach me stuff?!\u201d\nOh god, he could feel the stars in the kid\u2019s eyes. Hizashi was laughing, too, damn him.\n\u201cYes, Problem Child, I\u2019ll teach you a few things.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d cheer happily right now, but I really don\u2019t want to draw the Villains\u2019 attention.\u201d The kid squealed happily, though Shouta and Hizashi\u2019s expressions fell. It was easy to forget that this kid might not live to see the next few hours, let alone live long enough to meet them.\nThe kid fell quiet on the line for a moment, and Shouta immediately grew concerned. \u201cKid?\u201d\n\u201cI think they\u2019re coming back.\u201d\n\u201cShould we be quiet?\u201d Hizashi asked.\n\u201cNo, the headphones won\u2019t produce sound\u2026 they won\u2019t hear anything. Only I will.\u201d\nA voice trickled over the phone, and it wasn\u2019t the kid\u2019s.\n\u201cAll right, brat.\u201d The voice was harsh but young. \u201cGet up. Sensei wants to meet with you.\u201d\nIzuku followed along obediently. The man didn\u2019t restrain him\u2014he didn\u2019t have to. Izuku knew the consequences of acting out. The blue-haired man was frightening.\nKurogiri was waiting in the other room, which looked distinctly like a bar. He did his best to memorize every single detail\u2014especially the view of the window. Anything that could help the police and heroes locate him.\n\u201cRight this way.\u201d Kurogiri opened a portal and followed Izuku inside. Shigaraki stayed behind.\nIzuku didn\u2019t know where they were, now, and the more they walked, the more frightened they became. Finally, he opened the door to a room. It was spacious, and clean and smelled strongly of disinfectant\u2014like a hospital.\nA man was laying in the bed, hooked up to a ton of machines. It should\u2019ve made him look weak and frail, but for whatever reason, every atom of Izuku\u2019s body screamed at him that this man was by far the most dangerous person he\u2019d ever meet.\nHe froze, and immediately diverted his gaze.\n\u201cSo this is the boy. Come here\u2026 Midoriya, was it?\u201d\nHe shuddered hard. He nodded, and came forward. He was petrified and the man hadn\u2019t even done anything.\n\u201cYou\u2019re smart to be afraid of me.\u201d He smiled\u2014or at least he sounded like he was smiling. \u201cYou may call me Sensei.\u201d He paused, and reached out a hand. Izuku fought the urge to flinch as the cold fingers tilted his chin up so he had to look this\u2026 thing in the eye (not that this creature seemed to have them anymore). \u201cYes\u2026 you\u2019ll do very well. You\u2019ve got a strong will to survive, I can sense that. Maybe you\u2019ll retain some of your sanity? Don\u2019t worry, Midoriya. We\u2019ll take good care of you.\u201d\nIzuku wanted to ask. He tried, but no words fell from his lips. His jaw refused to unclench and he trembled.\n\u201cI can see your question\u2026 speak, child.\u201d\n\u201cW-what do you want from me?\u201d His voice was small, but it sounded a lot steadier than any part of him felt.\n\u201cLet me tell you a little about myself. My Quirk allows me to take the Quirks of others, or force them upon other people.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s stomach dropped as he listened. A Quirk like that in the hands of a villain?!\n\u201cBut you see\u2026 when I force too many Quirks on one person, they lose their mind. So I wondered if perhaps forcing those Quirks on a developing person\u2014a child\u2014would work better. And it did, but the results were still\u2026 subpar. So then I thought\u2026 what about a child without a Quirk? Perhaps they\u2019d handle it better? Someone without a Quirk Factor should adapt much more readily to a foreign Quirk, and if I give them multiple at once\u2026\u201d\nIzuku felt cold and hot all over. This man was going to turn him into a living lab rat and there was nothing he could do.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry so much. The mortality rate is only 75% for children.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t feel much better about that.\n\u201cOf course, we\u2019ve got a lot of preparation to do. I can\u2019t just give these Quirks to you\u2026 your body must be\u2026 prepared.\u201d The man turned his gaze to Kurogiri. \u201cHe will do. Keep him in the holding cell until the Doctor is ready for him. I\u2019ll expect you to take good care of our guest during his stay.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Sensei.\u201d\nIzuku had never been more grateful for a warp Quirk in his life.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, kid. We\u2019re going to get you out of there before he can do any of that.\u201d Present Mic sounded angry. And scared.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find you, Problem Child.\u201d Eraserhead\u2019s voice was deep and soothing, and Izuku clung to the two voices for all he was worth, because they were the only hope he had.\nHe didn\u2019t fully remember the trip back to his cell, but once the villain left him alone, he sank to the floor and let out a quiet sob.\n\u201cL-Little Listener?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d He whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve never\u2026 that man\u2026 If there was a personification of evil, it\u2019s that\u2026 monster. I can\u2019t stop trembling and I feel hot and cold all over, and\u2026 It felt like he could see into my soul.\u201d\n\u201cGod, Listener, if I could hug you right now, I would.\u201d Present Mic said, and Izuku had never ached for a hug so much in his life.\n\u201cI could use one, right now.\u201d Izuku admitted.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you the biggest hug when we rescue you. Promise.\u201d\nHe startled when the door to the cellar opened and Shigaraki came down the steps.\n\u201cSo you finally met Sensei! Isn\u2019t he amazing?\u201d There was a near fanatical gleam in his eye, and Izuku couldn\u2019t help but recognize a fanboy. It was almost comical that this guy seemed to idolize Sensei in the same way Izuku used to idolize All Might.\nSaying anything negative would be a bad idea. And saying anything positive would be too obvious of a lie.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met a man with a more powerful presence in my life.\u201d Izuku said in a hoarse whisper. This was apparently a good choice, because Shigaraki grinned.\n\u201cI know! He\u2019s incredible! Nobody is better than Sensei!\u201d\nIzuku noted that a gaming device was sticking out of the guy\u2019s pocket. \u201cYou play videogames?\u201d He ventured, and the man\u2019s face lit up like a child\u2019s. Izuku relaxed a little. A safe topic.\n\u201cOf course! Games are everything! In fact, life itself is just one big game, don\u2019t you agree? All these NPCs just take up space, and they\u2019re there for people like me\u2014Player Characters\u2014to do with as we please.\u201d\nIzuku was quickly getting a very good feel for this guy\u2019s mental-emotional state. He was a kid. A freaking kid. With no boundaries and no rules beyond whatever Sensei placed.\n\u201cSo here\u2019s my question.\u201d Shigaraki leaned in to look at Izuku. \u201cAre you a Player Character? Or an NPC?\u201d\nIzuku looked Shigaraki in the eye, but didn\u2019t answer.\n\u201cI guess we\u2019ll just find out, now won\u2019t we~?\u201d He leaned back with a grin. \u201cAh~ How fun! I love new games.\u201d With that, Shigaraki spun around on his heel and left Izuku alone.\n\u201cTalk about a few screws loose.\u201d Present Mic muttered under his breath, and Izuku snorted in amusement.\n\u201cMore like the wrong game card.\u201d\nHe liked to think that the snort on the other end was Eraserhead this time. Izuku let out a yawn.\n\u201cIt\u2019s late.\u201d Eraserhead stated. \u201cYou should try to get some rest while you can.\u201d\n\u201cThe call is half-way traced. We should have a location by tomorrow afternoon.\u201d Tsukauchi\u2019s voice sounded through the phone, and Izuku perked up.\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll be coming soon?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Just hold out another day, can you do that?\u201d Present Mic\u2019s voice asked.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Izuku nodded. He was going to say something else when something caught his eye. He fought the urge to gag.\n\u201cKid, you okay?\u201d Eraserhead\u2019s concerned voice sounded, and he realized he\u2019d let out a small whimper.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a dead body down here. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been smelling.\u201d He swallowed thickly, and could hear one of the men on the phone curse.\n\u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201d\nIzuku couldn\u2019t help but stare, though. Now that his eyes had adjusted to the darkness, it was more than obvious. There was something about the guy\u2026 His eyes widened when he caught sight of the jacket the man had worn. \u201cWait\u2026 I know this guy. H-he\u2019s a pro! The Enduring Hero; Everlast. He\u2019s a foreigner. I think he\u2019s a hero from Mexico.\u201d Izuku tilted his head for a moment. \u201cHis Quirk lets him regenerate lost limbs or recover from massive damage in minutes.\u201d\n\u201cSo you study foreign Heroes, too?\u201d He knew Eraserhead was trying to distract him, and he willingly allowed himself to latch onto the topic.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He smiled softly as he turned away from the half-rotted corpse. He tried not to think about the movement he\u2019d caught around the body. The little white maggots squirming around the\u2014nope. \u201cI study heroes from all over the world. You never know when the information\u2014particularly someone\u2019s fighting style or strategy\u2014will come in handy. Especially when it comes to taking out different kinds of Quirks.\u201d\n\u201cI wish half my first-years thought like you, kid.\u201d Eraserhead\u2019s words made Izuku beam. \u201cI hope to see you in my class in a few years.\u201d\nHe can\u2019t have heard that right. \u201cY-you really want a Quirkless kid in your heroics class?! B-but you teach Class 1\u2013A at UA!\u201d\n\u201cHe knows you teach?\u201d Present Mic gawked.\n\u201cHe figured it out on his own\u2014same with our relationship.\u201d\nPresent Mic let out a whistle. \u201cDamn, Little Listener. You\u2019ve got one hell of a talent, there.\u201d Izuku flushed.\n\u201cTry to get some rest, Problem Child. It\u2019s two in the morning, and you\u2019ve got to be exhausted. We\u2019ll keep an ear out for you.\u201d\nIzuku abruptly realized that he was exhausted. But the fear of an unknown and hostile environment had kept him from feeling it. \u201cThank you.\u201d He curled up on the ratty futon that was laid out in the cell, and covered himself with the moth-eaten blanket. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d He whispered.\n\u201cSleep well, Problem Child, we\u2019ll come for you as soon as we can.\u201d Eraserhead\u2019s voice was deep and calm. It made him feel a little safer.\n\u201cNight Little Listener. We\u2019ll be here if you need us.\u201d Present Mic sounded gentle and warm, like a hug. It made him think of all the nights he\u2019d fallen asleep listening to the man\u2019s radio show.\n\u201cGoodnight, Midoriya. Tomorrow\u2019s gonna be a long day.\u201d The detective\u2019s voice was a little jarring, but it reminded him that people were searching for him. He\u2019d be okay.\nHe had to believe that.\nShouta wasn\u2019t the kind of guy to get attached to people. That was his husband\u2019s job, not his. He saved people, handed them over to the medics, and left it at that. He usually never really thought about them again. But for some reason, this kid was different.\nHe felt attached to Midoriya Izuku. Goddamnit. A Problem Child I\u2019m not even paid to deal with. And I\u2019m willingly thinking about spending time with him when this is all over?\nMaybe he was sick.\n\u201cSo, you thinking of sponsoring him for U.A.?\u201d Hizashi asked. They\u2019d muted the phone so that they didn\u2019t accidentally wake the kid. God knows he needed all the sleep he could get.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Shouta denied.\n\u201cDon\u2019t pull that with me. You know teachers can put in a recommendation to Nezu for anyone they think might be a good fit for a program at U.A.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t then I will.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about that Sensei person.\u201d Shouta changed the topic, and Hizashi\u2019s grin fell.\n\u201cA man who can steal Quirks and hand them out as he pleases\u2026\u201d He shuddered. \u201cI had no idea someone like that even existed.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible he has some kind of longevity Quirk he\u2019s stolen\u2014he could\u2019ve been around for a while and nobody would know.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to rescue Midoriya before they do anything. Like hell I\u2019m letting him do that to a child.\u201d His fists clenched in fury, and Shouta felt much the same.\nWhen Sensei had started talking about turning Midoriya into an experiment, he\u2019d seen red. Logically, he knew their odds of finding Midoriya before they did something to him were slim, but they had to try. There was no way they could bring this Sensei person down right now, either.\nThey had no solid location for the man, and if they hadn\u2019t heard of him before now then he was damn good at staying under the radar. No, right now their top priority was Midoriya. They could worry about the villains after the kid was safe.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve hit 70% on the tracer.\u201d Tsukauchi came into the room with three cups of coffee, which Shouta and Hizashi gratefully accepted. \u201cWe should have a precise enough location to move out within the next six hours.\u201d\n\u201cSo by nine AM?\u201d Hizashi questioned.\n\u201cYeah. Hopefully, we can do this before any of the villains do anything to the kid.\u201d Tsukauchi sighed, taking a long drink from his coffee.\n\u201cHow\u2019s his mother holding up?\u201d Shouta asked.\n\u201cAs well as can be expected.\u201d Tsukauchi sighed. \u201cSansa\u2019s with her, now. She\u2019s a worrier\u2014had several anxiety attacks already. He\u2019s good with people like that.\u201d\n\u201cThe kid\u2019s holding up really well.\u201d Shouta noted. \u201cMost people in his situation would be freaking out\u2014especially with a corpse in the room.\u201d\nTsukauchi choked on his coffee. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, a what?\u201d They must\u2019ve forgotten to inform the detective of that little detail. Come to think of it, did they mention Sensei to him? He went to ask when Hizashi spoke up.\n\u201cYeah, that missing hero, Everlast? From Mexico? He\u2019s dead. Kid identified the body in the cell next to him.\u201d Hizashi grimaced.\n\u201cHold on.\u201d Tsukauchi typed something into his computer before the file came up. \u201cYep. Everlast, 28-years-old. Been a pro for five years, went missing about a month ago.\u201d\n\u201cGuess that\u2019s one case we can close.\u201d Shouta winced. He would\u2019ve rather a kid not found the body, but it was done, now.\nShouta stretched and pulled out his phone. It was nearly four in the morning. He got up and stepped out of the room before dialing a number.\n\u201cAizawa? You\u2019re calling awfully early.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to make my classes today\u2014Hero work.\u201d\n\u201cHow unusual for you. You\u2019re not normally one to get wrapped up in cases during the school year. Should I be concerned?\u201d\n\u201cKidnapped civilian. Mic\u2019s working with me on this one, so you should find someone to cover his class, too.\u201d Shouta rubbed his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s expected to last at least through the morning, likely through the early afternoon as well.\u201d\n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll cover your class and have Midnight cover Mic\u2019s.\u201d He could hear Nezu grin.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cDo keep me informed.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d He hesitated a moment. \u201cAnd you might be interested in this kid, too.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s got one hell of a head on his shoulders. His analysis skills are terrifying.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then, I\u2019ll look forward to meeting him.\u201d\nHizashi was a people person\u2014he always had been, and he always would be. It was partially why his radio show did as well as it did. He also had a big soft spot for kids (so did Shouta, but he\u2019d never admit it).\nAtlas had been a caller of his for almost three years straight. He\u2019d call every night. He started when he was four, and kept calling until he was about seven. He\u2019d been so adorable, and many people tuned in just for the half hour of conversation he\u2019d have with the kid each night. Many of his current listeners were people who\u2019d tuned in for Atlas, and simply stayed because of habit.\nBut now that same kid, who he now knew was Midoriya Izuku, was in serious trouble. And he felt so helpless when they couldn\u2019t do anything but talk to him.\nHe wanted nothing more than to scoop the Little Listener up and shield him from all the villains that wanted to hurt him. And he would! As soon as they found him.\nHe scowled as he glanced at the clock. It was six in the morning. There was about three hours remaining until they had a precise enough location to move out. Every able hand at the station\u2014cop or hero\u2014was working tirelessly to try to find the kid as soon as they could.\nThey were exhausting their resources and themselves. Neither he nor his husband slept a wink last night, and he knew Shou had called Nezu to inform him that they were skipping classes\u2014a rarity for either of them.\n\u201cYou still there?\u201d A small voice asked over the phone, startling Hizashi, who was currently alone in the room. He quickly unmuted the phone.\n\u201cYeah, Little Listener; I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\u201cMic.\u201d He could hear the relief in the kid\u2019s voice.\n\u201cFeel free to call me Yamada. It\u2019s my civilian name.\u201d\n\u201cY-you\u2019d really trust me with that?\u201d\n\u201cOf course!\u201d\n\u201cY-you can cal me Izuku, then.\u201d\n\u201cHm\u2026 Tell me then, little Izuku, what kind of hero do you want to become?\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of hero?\u201d He paused for a moment to think. \u201cAny kind works for me, so long as I help people. I doubt I\u2019d be a good limelight hero right off the bat, so maybe a support hero or an underground hero? Since I\u2019d be relying mostly on my support gear and inventions, it\u2019d probably be a good idea to team up with someone who can fight well against people with Quirks that can nullify or otherwise control electronics. I can analyze, plan and fight where I can, while my partner deals the heavy blows. So I guess maybe someone like Nighteye or you? \u2018Cause you started off as a support hero until you got a good feel for how things worked, and then you branched off on your own. You still typically team up with close-combat heroes so you can provide ranged support, so something like that\u2019d probably be a good matchup for me.\u201d\nDid the kid even take a breath?! \u201cWow, you\u2019ve given this a lot of thought!\u201d Hizashi grinned.\n\u201cOf course. It\u2019s my future, after all. I can\u2019t just stop at getting into high school\u2014I have to look at the bigger picture.\u201d\nHe smiled as they made idle chat for about twenty minutes. Shouta eventually came back into the room.\n\u201cOh? You\u2019re awake, Problem Child.\u201d\n\u201cEraserhead!\u201d The kid\u2019s smile was audible, and Hizashi couldn\u2019t wait to see it in person.\n\u201cYou can use my hero name when there are other people around, but when it\u2019s just us and Hizashi, you can call me Aizawa.\u201d\nHizashi swore he heard the kid squeal in excitement.\n\u201cT-thank you, Aizawa!\u201d Yep, that was definitely an excited squeal.\n\u201cWe should have enough of a location within the next two hours or so, and ready to head out soon after.\u201d Shouta informed him, and Hizashi let out a silent breath. They\u2019d shaved off another half hour\u2014that was fantastic. He glanced at the clock. It was about six-thirty.\nThey heard the sound of metal screeching against metal, and the heroes stiffened. \u201cGet up, brat.\u201d Shigaraki spoke, and the two winced. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have some fun today.\u201d\nThey could hear scuffling as Izuku complied with the villain.\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d He asked in a small voice.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see the doctor, of course!\u201d\nHizashi felt his blood turn to ice as he shared a horrified look with Shouta. He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever seen his husband so pale.\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t look so scared!\u201d Shigaraki continued. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little torture. Nothing major. Just preparing you for your makeover in a few days.\u201d There was the sound of another door opening, and some scuffling. \u201cWait here. Try anything, and I\u2019ll start removing fingers.\u201d\nThe door closed again. The kid let out a small heartbreaking whimper and Hizashi felt tears prick his eyes.\n\u201cHang in there, kid.\u201d Shouta tried reassuring him.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. We\u2019ll be coming for you before you know it.\u201d Hizashi tried.\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d The kid sounded more like he was trying to convince himself. \u201cI\u2019m going to mute the mic on my end for a little bit.\u201d\n\u201cWait, kid, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Hizashi tried, but the kid cut him off.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s okay. Really! I don\u2019t want you to\u2026 have to listen to this.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no shame in it.\u201d Shouta spoke up. \u201cPros scream, too. We\u2019re all human. We also need the audio of this \u2018doctor\u2019 person so we can make a file on him.\u201d\nThe kid hesitated. \u201cO-okay.\u201d\nShouta and Hizashi shared a look. This was not going to be easy to listen to. He had half a mind to let the kid mute himself, but they needed to be there with the kid. In any way they could be.\nThey heard the door open again. \u201cHello, Midoriya Izuku. I\u2019m the Doctor. Good to see you again.\u201d\nGaraki Kyudai, better known as Ujiko Daruma had been having a wonderful morning. He woke up at four, made himself breakfast, checked on his wonderful children (the Nomu), and enjoyed a nice hot cup of coffee with a splash of half-and-half and three sugars.\nToday, he had a new child to prep. This one was Quirkless, and would likely take to the Quirks a lot better than the others they\u2019d played around with. Maybe he could get another masterpiece out of this one? He really hoped so.\nHe\u2019d looked at the kid\u2019s file, but hadn\u2019t bothered to look at the photo. He\u2019d see the kid soon enough, and he could evaluate his newest doll with his own critical eye.\nWhat he hadn\u2019t expected when he walked into the room, was to see the same kid he\u2019d pronounced Quirkless while he\u2019d been practicing under the pseudonym of Tsubassa. Looked like the kid recognized him, too.\n\u201cHello, Midoriya Izuku. I\u2019m the Doctor. Good to see you again.\u201d He grinned as the boy startled.\n\u201cD-Doctor Tsubassa?! W-wait! You work for\u2026?!\u201d\n\u201cYes. I do.\u201d He grinned. He hadn\u2019t expected this, but he was even more excited to start, now. \u201cHow\u2019s your mother? I think I still have your address written down somewhere.\u201d\nThe kid stiffened and there was a shine of fear in his eyes. Good. He didn\u2019t really have the information written, but it\u2019d be easy enough to get\u2014they had his name, after all. There weren\u2019t many Quirkless Midoriya Izukus running around Musutafu, after all.\n\u201cNormally, I\u2019d have you change into something more comfortable, but you should be fine in what you\u2019ve got on. Though the shirt must come off.\u201d He waited with a gleeful smile as the kid listened, and removed his shirt. The unblemished skin\u2026 Wait, that wasn\u2019t unblemished. He frowned.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve an impressive number of scars. Burns? And is that a stab scar?\u201d\n\u201cI get bullied a lot.\u201d The kid answered grimly.\n\u201cWell that won\u2019t do. You\u2019re one of my children, now. I simply won\u2019t have anyone hurting what\u2019s mine.\u201d\nThe kid paled a bit. Was he being overly possessive again? It didn\u2019t matter, the child would likely lose his mind in the next week or so anyways. Shame, because those eyes shone with intelligence. Perhaps he would make it through with enough will to speak?\nWell, it was no matter. He led the kid to the table and strapped him down. Now was the fun part.\n\u201cI\u2019m not like other people\u2014I\u2019ll explain what I\u2019m doing as I go. It\u2019s better for me to think out loud anyways, not that you\u2019ll be able to process much once we really get started. Do try not to scream too loudly, though.\u201d He grinned.\n\u201cFirst, we\u2019re going to make absolutely certain that you have no Quirk Factor.\u201d He pulled out a syringe. \u201cThis little gem is something of a prototype I got from a friend. It destroys any Quirk Factor that may be there. Since you\u2019re Quirkless, it really shouldn\u2019t hurt much.\u201d He injected the concoction into the boy, and watched as he shivered.\n\u201cGood. As I thought, you really are Quirkless. Not a trace of the Quirk Factor. Lucky you.\u201d He quickly set up the IV. \u201cNow this is going to hurt.\u201d He bounced on the heels of his feet in anticipation. \u201cI\u2019ve found that you can force a dormant Quirk Factor to activate\u2014or in your case open the space for one\u2014when specific conditions are met. When the body believes itself to be in mortal danger, and the pain sensors are on overload, it\u2019ll do whatever it takes to survive. In Quirked individuals, it\u2019ll heighten their Quirk and push that into overdrive. But for you, I\u2019ll need to train your body to think that way. This\u2019ll help keep you from dying once a Quirk is introduced.\u201d\nHe opened the channel and put on a pair of gloves. He grabbed a scalpel and grinned.\n\u201cOf course, that\u2019s if you survive the procedure.\u201d\nShouta was beyond angry. Listening to the monster describing what he was doing to this child made him want to vomit. He pushed his coffee away in distaste.\nThey\u2019d heard a few whimpers from the kid, but he hadn\u2019t screamed once. Hizashi was pale and shaking, and Shouta was pacing the room. He held onto his anger, knowing that the moment he let it go, he\u2019d be in the same state as his husband.\nOh, when they found this Tsubassa person, he was a hundred different kinds of dead. And Shouta would make sure that there would be no body to be found. Not even this Sensei of a million Quirks would be able to stop Shouta once he got his hands on this\u2014\n\u201cShou, you\u2019re muttering again.\u201d Hizashi spoke quietly.\nDamn, he thought he broke that habit in middle school.\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing great, kid. Just hold on.\u201d Hizashi winced as his voice cracked\u2014something that Shouta had only heard from his husband once or twice. He said it hurt a lot, since his voice was essentially his Quirk. Hizashi rubbed his neck a bit and Shouta pushed a hot cup of water and honey into his hands.\nHe glanced at the clock. This had been going on for an hour, now. \u201cWe\u2019re rootin\u2019 for ya, Problem Child.\u201d He was worried that the kid hadn\u2019t screamed. From the descriptions, the kid should be in agony. Shouta, himself, would be screaming at half the shit this abomination was doing.\nTsukauchi was pale-faced at the doorframe, having walked in about ten minutes ago.\n\u201cThat should be enough for today. We\u2019ll pick up where we left off tomorrow.\u201d The doctor finally said, and the three men let out massive sighs of relief. Thankfully, nothing that he described should be permanent, aside from scarring.\nThere was shuffling and the sound of a door opening before his small hoarse voice spoke.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t kill me, bitches.\u201d\nHizashi let out a small half-chuckle even as some tears ran down his face. \u201cListener, you\u2019re one hell of a fighter.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like it. I feel like I lost a fight with an electrified wood chipper.\u201d He gave a dry cough and gasped briefly in pain. \u201cStill good.\u201d\n\u201cYou did better than most pros. Be proud of that, Problem Child.\u201d\n\u201cYou really think so?\u201d\nTsukauchi went to open his mouth when an officer dashed over to him. He whispered something and the detective grinned. \u201cSuit up, boys. Kid, we\u2019ve got your location.\u201d\n\u201cFINALLY!\u201d Hizashi cheered and Shouta let a grin spread on his face.\n\u201cKid, hold tight\u2014we\u2019re on our way.\u201d\nIzuku had never been more relieved nor anxious than when Eraserhead told him they were on their way. He was in pain, and his entire body hurt like nothing he\u2019d ever felt, but it was starting to fade.\nHe hadn\u2019t eaten in two days\u2014because like hell he was going to eat what the villains gave him\u2014and he honestly slept like shit last night. But they had his location. They were coming to get him\u2014at last.\nThey\u2019d left another officer on the phone with him\u2014the same one that had initially answered his call. Had it really only been one day? It felt like forever ago.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep you posted on what\u2019s going on with the heroes, nya.\u201d Sansa said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still with ya, kid. We patched the signals together, so we can hear you, too.\u201d Aizawa\u2019s voice filtered through and Izuku felt himself relax a little. The man\u2019s voice was really comforting. Yamada\u2019s voice made him smile, Tsukauchi\u2019s made him feel calm, but Aizawa\u2019s made him feel safe. And that was really what he needed right now.\n\u201cThanks, Aizawa.\u201d He smiled.\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s Eraserhead on duty, Problem Child.\u201d\n\u201cRight. Sorry!\u201d His smile grew wider. There wasn\u2019t a drop of venom in the man\u2019s voice, and it sounded almost teasing to his ears.\nHe was going to be out of here! They were coming to rescue him!\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be there in less than ten minutes, Izuku! Hold tight.\u201d Yamada said.\n\u201cDestination is fast approaching on the left\u2014looks like a bar of some kind.\u201d Sansa said.\n\u201cGot it. We\u2019ll surround the building first and I\u2019ll follow the heroes in with Team A.\u201d Tsukauchi\u2019s voice was stern and meant business. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there, kid.\u201d\n\u201cGood, because\u2014\u201d He cut himself off when the door opened. Shit.\n\u201cAh, so it appears you are more durable than a normal NPC.\u201d Shigaraki\u2019s smile sent a shiver down his spine. \u201cMaybe you are a Player Character after all. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\nHe took a moment to eye the untouched plate of food they\u2019d given him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t eat. That\u2019s rather rude.\u201d Izuku stiffened. \u201cHere we are sharing our food with you, and you waste it.\u201d He glared.\n\u201cThree minutes.\u201d Aizawa\u2019s voice was tense, and he could hear them readying weapons.\n\u201cWell?!\u201d Shigaraki\u2019s hand reached forward and grabbed Izuku\u2019s shoulder, making him stiffen in fear. He felt four fingers. \u201cAre you going to answer, boy? Because I doubt Doctor Ujiko would be too angry if I only took your arm.\u201d Izuku didn\u2019t doubt for a second that he\u2019d do it, too.\n\u201cI-I was feeling sick. I didn\u2019t think I could stomach the food.\u201d He answered hesitantly. He swore he could feel the finger inching closer.\n\u201cA minute and a half, pick it up!\u201d Yamada\u2019s voice sounded, and Izuku was so fucking grateful that he made these earbuds bypass the eardrum; otherwise Shigaraki would\u2019ve heard that for sure.\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Izuku stuttered out, and the finger froze, touching only his shirt. He winced as he felt the fabric turn to dust under the man\u2019s grip\u2014he swore he felt the hairs on his shoulder turn to dust, too.\n\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d Shigaraki grinned and pulled away. Izuku let out a shaky sigh of relief. \u201cI expect you to remember your manners.\u201d He grinned and wrapped his hand around Izuku\u2019s left forearm.\n\u201cAH!\u201d He cried out in surprise and pain as he felt the skin cracking and flaking off, revealing muscle.\n\u201cIzuku!\u201d Aizawa\u2019s voice called out. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d\nShigaraki pulled his hand back as Izuku\u2019s arm started to sluggishly drip blood. \u201cRemember that, brat. I\u2019ll leave you with your arm this time.\u201d\nHe clutched his arm like an injured puppy and watched as the blue-haired man left the room.\n\u201cI\u2019m okay. He just disintegrated part of my arm.\u201d He wrapped the injury in his shirt.\n\u201cKid, you\u2019re gonna give us a heart attack.\u201d Tsukauchi muttered.\n\u201cThough the disintegration felt different than I expected. And the way my skin flaked\u2026 I wonder if it isn\u2019t closer to a hyper-dehydration than actual disintegration? Possibly Decay\u2026 Or perhaps a dual-quirk that\u2019s so similar that nobody\u2019s realized it? Dehydration for organic materials and disintegration for inorganic materials? Though it does burn a bit\u2026 perhaps it\u2019s something else entirely? Though that could just be the filth in the area causing the burning sensation\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s something happening on an atomic or cellular level?\u201d\n\u201cYou mutter, too, huh? Eraser had the same habit.\u201d Yamada sounded mildly amused, and Izuku quickly slapped a hand over his mouth.\nOh, god, was he muttering out loud?! In front of his heroes while being held captive by villains?! He was analyzing a Quirk that had been used on him. To hurt him. They must think he\u2019s such a weirdo.\n\u201cNothing wrong with having a fast mind, Problem Child. Just try to curb the mutter.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s impressed by your analysis, though.\u201d Yamada added, and he could hear Eraserhead\u2019s huff.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d Tsukauchi announced, and Izuku felt jittery in anticipation.\nHe took a deep breath as he heard a commotion kick up on the radio. Sounds of doors being kicked down and yelling and fighting. Izuku heard the commotion upstairs, too.\nFor a moment, he feared that Kurogiri would come down and warp him away before the heroes could come and save him. That they\u2019d burst through the door just as he was being carted back to Dr. Tsubassa\u2019s lab of Hell, and he\u2019d be turned into one of those monsters he\u2019d glimpsed during his torture session that morning.\nHe heard the door open, and tensed.\n\u201cListener?!\u201d He blinked up in shocked relief when he saw Present Mic and Eraserhead standing there with a man in a tan trench coat that could only be Tsukauchi.\n\u201cI-I\u2019m over here!\u201d He called out, and the three ran over to the door.\n\u201cHey there, Problem Child.\u201d Eraserhead grinned as he pulled out a bobby pin and picked the lock to his cell in record time.\nIzuku didn\u2019t care, in that moment, how weak it could make him look. He ran right into the arms of the Erasure Hero. Aizawa scooped him up and held him securely as he clung to him like a lifeline.\n\u201cWe got him!\u201d Yamada grinned as he spoke into the microphone.\n\u201cThank god.\u201d Sansa said over the line. He could hear some cheering in the background on the other end of the line. Was the whole station involved in this?\n\u201cCome on, Problem Child. Let\u2019s get you patched up.\u201d Aizawa\u2019s grip tightened around him, and Izuku hid his face in the man\u2019s Capture Weapon. He let the tears cascade down his face as he relaxed into the man\u2019s protective embrace.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d He whispered as they stepped out into the sunlight. There were tons of cops gathered around, weapons at the ready.\n\u201cSir!\u201d A group of cops came back out of the building. \u201cThe villains escaped through a Warp Portal.\u201d\n\u201cDamnit.\u201d Yamada cursed as Aizawa carried Izuku to the ambulance. He was loaded in, and the dark-haired hero climbed into the back of the ambulance with him, much to his relief.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll meet you at the hospital.\u201d Tsukauchi promised.\n\u201cThank you. Thank you.\u201d Izuku couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say. He was finally safe.\nAizawa gently petted his hair as the medics got to work. The only thing he could really feel was the man\u2019s calloused fingers threading through his tangled locks. He smiled softly as he finally gave into his exhaustion, and drifted off to sleep.\n\nI\u2019m safe.\n"
