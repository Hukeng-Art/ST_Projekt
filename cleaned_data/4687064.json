    "text": "The necromancer is the last straw.\nThey put it to a vote. Stiles was all for killing the bitch. Derek was too. But they argued about how, because Stiles wanted to drain her and take her magic away, while Derek wanted to take her entire head away. Both were effective though, so Stiles compromised and chose a magical draining ritual before the beheading.\nDerek\u2019s betas, Isaac, Boyd and Erica, and Lydia, Danny, and Jackson, each had their own opinions, but they all agreed with Stiles\u2019 practical plan \u2013 as morbid as it may sound to call it a beheading practical.\nIn hindsight, Stiles should have known better. He had seen the look on Scott\u2019s face, the way his lips curled and his crooked jaw tensed. Allison had looked much the same, for all she had also wanted to kill the bitch, but her eyes had narrowed at Stiles\u2019 rather flippant tone.\nBut Stiles had ignored his gut feeling, had ignored Scott\u2019s claims that they were sentencing a person to die.\nStiles remained steadfast; the death of one over the death of more, it was an easy choice for him.\nScott refused and before a decision could be made, he, with Deaton\u2019s help, chose to lock the necromancer away.\nIt was laughable.\nNecromancers fed from the life force of any creature and all it took was a rat scurrying into her cell to help her free herself. She killed seven more civilians, one of whom was seven years old.\nThat is how they ended up here and now.\n\u201cHer name was Ava and she was seven fucking years old, Scott!\u201d Stiles screams, remembers how it felt like his heart had been ripped out of his chest when he saw those crime scene photos. \u201cAnd that fucking necromancer killed her all because we didn\u2019t chop her head off when we had the chance!\u201d\nScott is fanged and red-eyed and he snarls. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been right to kill her!\u201d\n\u201cWhat? And you think it was fucking okay for that damn bitch to kill that kid?\u201d\nScott purses his lips, obviously conflicted, but there is a hard, stubborn edge to his jaw that Stiles recognizes. It makes him more furious than he has ever been in his entire life.\n\u201cSeven fucking years old, Scott,\u201d he hisses.\n\u201cWe are not killers,\u201d Scott says, tries to reason.\nIt makes Stiles laugh and the sound is ugly. He notices the others flinch and it makes him laugh some more.\n\u201cReally? Really, Scott? We\u2019re supposed to protect this damn town! Protect people from getting hurt! So don\u2019t go saying we\u2019re not killers or preaching that there is always going to be another way! Because not killing that damn necromancer was the same fucking thing as if we were the ones who killed those people!\u201d\nIt is the one thing Stiles knows Scott doesn\u2019t want to hear, and the young Alpha roars.\n\u201cShut up!\u201d\nBut Stiles is fearless in the face of his own mistake, in the nth death he is unable to stop.\n\u201cThere are no absolutes, Scott! No hard rights or hard wrongs! The world doesn\u2019t fucking work that way and we can\u2019t afford to think like that, because people are going to die! We signed up for that the moment we got involved with all this!\u201d\nScott\u2019s face morphs into something cruel and malicious.\n\u201cWe? We?\u201d he hisses. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you? Don\u2019t forget that you\u2019re the one who dragged us into that forest the night it all started, Stiles. So if it\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault, it\u2019s yours.\u201d\nSomething inside Stiles cracks, so strong and so deep that he practically hears it.\nNo one says a word, even Derek, but that\u2019s only because the Alpha roars, loud and strong and absolutely furious.\nScott roars back and angrily stomps out, and Stiles feels something inside him break some more.\nLydia is furious, so much so that her long hair floats about her shoulders like an out of control flame. Her lips are pressed tightly together and it is obvious that she wants to scream. Jackson looks conflicted and Danny looks disgusted.\nDerek\u2019s betas are as angry as their Alpha, golden eyes gleaming and Erica already flexing claw-tipped fingers.\nAllison follows after Scott, but looks back one last time. No one follows her.\nStiles does nothing, and years later he\u2019ll wonder if he should have gone after Scott, if that will have changed things.\nBut at this moment, he doesn\u2019t go after him.\nThus begins the great divide.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAllison sticks close to Scott in school and it is obvious that she has made her choice. Stiles doesn\u2019t even want to know if it\u2019s a choice made as a huntress or as a lover. He thinks he\u2019ll be disappointed either way.\nDerek\u2019s betas choose Stiles and Stiles knows better than to belittle them and assume that Derek put them up to it. As sure and as willingly as Erica, Boyd and Isaac chose the bite when Derek offered, Stiles knows they can make up their mind the same way on who they choose to support.\nIt bothers Stiles when Lydia and Danny choose neither, with a conflicted Jackson following after. Jackson feels the pull to his Alpha, the same way as his fellow betas, but his heart is with his makeshift pack. Stiles understands but part of him just wants the other two, immensely intelligent and pragmatic individuals that they are, to finally make a stand, even if it\u2019s not at Stiles\u2019 back.\nThe truth sinks into Stiles two weeks later, when Scott refuses to stand beside him during Ava\u2019s funeral, choosing a spot clear across the casket. What\u2019s more is that he brings Deaton with him.\nStiles has never trusted Deaton, Scott knows this, and this is as sure a declaration as anything.\nStiles finally makes a decision a few days after that when he sees Scott and Allison after school with Kira Yukimura, the new girl, the one Derek identified as a kitsune. They had been meaning to set up a meeting with her pack, which the betas scouted out to only be her parents and no one else, but they hadn\u2019t been able to do so given the clusterfuck that\u00a0had been happening one after the other.\nNow Scott and Allison are taking her with them, all smiles and friendly laughter as they board Allison\u2019s car.\nIsaac and Boyd follow after and a few hours later, they confirm that Scott and Allison bought Kira to Deaton and then went to the Yukimura pack. The next day, Kira starts sitting with them. The day after that it\u2019s a freshman by the name of Liam.\nThe betas don\u2019t say anything about a new wolf, but Stiles can feel intent. By the way he sees Lydia purse her lips at the sight, she obviously thinks the same.\nScott is making his move. He\u2019s keeping secrets, not telling Stiles anything anymore.\nStiles decides to do the same.\nHe drives to the loft, has never been surer of anything in his life the moment he parks his jeep, gets out, and barges inside. He barely registers the sound of Lydia\u2019s car behind him and the sound of clacking heels and stomping sneakers.\nDerek stands in the middle of the room, dressed in one of his signature Henleys. Erica and Boyd are peering out from the kitchen and Isaac from the stairs leading up to the second floor.\nBehind Stiles, he can hear Lydia\u2019s breaths and Jackson and Danny\u2019s murmurs.\nStiles can\u2019t bite his shoulder even though that\u2019s where he wanted it to scar, close to his throat to where his pulse beats strong and sure and unrepentant. So Stiles brings his right hand to his mouth, eyes right on Derek as he sinks his teeth into the fleshy part of his thumb. He relishes in the copper that floods his tongue.\nThe wolves snarl and the humans gasp.\nDerek\u2019s eyes narrow, his nostrils flare, and his fingers curl into a fist. He makes no move to stop Stiles and watches closely as blood trickles down his wrist.\nStiles releases his bloody hand and offers it to Derek, palm down.\n\u201cAlpha,\u201d he says, voice as strong and sure as the way his heart beats.\nDerek steps forward and raises his hand, lets his fingers trail over the back of Stiles\u2019 fingers, light and ticklish for such strong, thick hands. His reaches Stiles\u2019 wrist, grips it tight, and the next thing Stiles knows, he\u2019s being dragged forward until Derek\u2019s fangs are hovering mere centimeters from his bleeding wound and his eyes are Alpha-red from bloodlust.\nStiles is more surprised from being jerked forward than the sight of Derek\u2019s fangs. He\u2019s not even surprised by the question in Derek\u2019s eyes.\nOne last chance to back out. One last chance to choose someone else\nOne last chance to walk away.\nStiles remains steadfast in the face of the Alpha before him.\n\u201cNo regrets,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cNo turning back.\u201d\nDerek smirks, a sense of pride shining in his blood-red eyes. He sinks his fangs into Stiles\u2019 right hand, right over the teeth marks, hard enough to further the bleed and make sure it scars, but not enough to turn.\nHere. Stiles wants it here, this hand, because starting today this is who he is, how he\u2019ll introduce himself to the fucked up world the moment he reaches out his hand\u2026\nDerek\u2019s beta. Derek\u2019s packmate.\n\nDerek\u2019s.\n\nDerek releases his hand, fangs and lips tinged with blood. Pain radiates from the wound, but it gentles with each black line that swirls through Derek\u2019s hand and forearm.\n\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t take it way,\u201d Stiles says, feels relieved when the pain returns. \u201cThis is proof.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes fade back to its swirl of green-gold-black and he nods, understanding.\nDerek isn\u2019t a monster, for all people \u2013 Stiles included \u2013 labels him as such. He doesn\u2019t always choose the right option, makes his fair share of mistakes, and remains stubborn where he should yield. He\u2019s lost and lonely, driven to the extremes, and desperate to secure his own survival. He\u2019s been shunned, tortured, accused, mocked, abused and caged, but\u2026\nDerek sees the world differently. He learned far too young that there is no such thing as black and white, that the world is bathed in shades of gray but, to his very core, still wants to save people the way nobody has ever saved him.\nAnd Derek had stopped and asked, had given Stiles a choice despite how easy it was to sink his fangs into Stiles\u2019 bleeding hand. (He has always given Stiles an out, even back when Stiles didn\u2019t recognize it as such.)\nHe asked.\nAnd to Stiles, that makes all the difference.\nThat is why Stiles knows he made the right choice.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt doesn\u2019t go over well with Scott, but Stiles doesn\u2019t expect anything less.\nScott sees the scar on Stiles\u2019 hand the day after as they face one another in the hall \u2013 Derek\u2019s bite healed minutes after the bond solidified.\nStiles knows better than to think this is an accidental meeting. As much as Scott denies his wolf, he still would have felt the pack bond between the\u00a0two of them dissolve.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy for you to throw it all away,\u201d he says, clipped and accusing.\nIt is tempting to be angry, to point out that Scott made the first move when he chose to walk away,\u00a0started keeping secrets, and chose to set himself apart from the people he thinks are killers.\nStiles doesn\u2019t feel angry though. Mostly, he feels sad and heavy.\nPeople say that you find out a lot about a person in the way they handle difficult situations. That has never been more apparent here.\nIn a normal world, before, Scott and Stiles were two peas in a pod.\nIn this world, now, they are as different as night and day.\nBecause Stiles grew up far too fast, lost his mother, and got to know Death like an old friend in the way Scott didn\u2019t, doesn\u2019t. Stiles will just as easily choose Death as an option when Scott will only ever choose Life.\nThey would have made a good pair, but\u2026\n\u201cI didn\u2019t throw it all away. I\u2019m still your best friend, Scott, but I can\u2019t be around you when you keep blaming me for what happened,\u201d he says, soft and so very tired. \u201cSometimes I wish things would have gone differently, but you cannot hold that over my head.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026what\u2019s more is that I won\u2019t let you.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t say sorry, because it doesn\u2019t seem like something to be sorry for, not when Stiles knows that he and Scott were just a victim of circumstance that fateful night.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to fight, Scott,\u201d Stiles says, pleads. \u201cBut you have to understand that there are times we can\u2019t afford to follow the kind of philosophy you want us to have.\u201d\nScott doesn\u2019t even reply, doesn\u2019t even try to fight for this friendship.\nHe just walks away.\nStiles is wrong. The necromancer isn\u2019t the last straw.\nIt\u2019s this.\nAnd Stiles turns around and walks down another path.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles is seated on Derek\u2019s couch when the Alpha comes home that night. Scrolls, documents, and ancient tomes are scattered before him on the coffee table, but Stiles is focused in his work, doesn\u2019t even look up when the doors slide open.\nIt is nearing midnight. Stiles can\u2019t sleep, doesn\u2019t want to sleep, finds himself seeking his Alpha.\nThere\u2019s the rustle of plastic and the sound of a soda can popping open. Stiles hears Derek approach and the next thing he knows, there\u2019s a burger and a soda placed in front of him. Derek sits down beside him with his own meal.\nStiles doesn\u2019t stop working, takes a bite of his burger for every five paragraphs he reads or every page he writes.\nDerek clears his throat. \u201cYou made your choice.\u201d\nStiles scoffs and holds his right hand up towards Derek without even looking at him. \u201cDerek, I made my choice even before this happened. This is not about me having second thoughts. This is about me\u2026\u201d He sighs, lets his pencil slip through his fingers.\nStiles thinks he\u2019ll always feel a bit guilty with the hand he played that changed Scott\u2019s life forever, but Stiles knew better than to let himself be controlled by it. He doesn\u2019t want to stay in a toxic friendship, forced to always feel that he\u2019s wrong, that he\u2019s to blame, that he\u2019s the bad guy for not always choosing what\u2019s categorically right and good.\nBut\u2026\n\u201cI hoped Scott would change his mind, but he didn\u2019t. Then I realized\u2026 it\u2019s hard to\u2026 it\u2019s hard to\u2026\u201d Frustration wells up inside him and Stiles is scared he\u2019ll end up crying. \u201cScott is a good person, Derek. He\u2019s not the best Alpha, but he\u2019s a good person.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s arguing with Derek or himself.\n\u201c\u2026 but it\u2019s hard to change the mind of someone who doesn\u2019t want to understand in the first place,\u201d Derek finishes.\nIt hurts. The words hurt. Stiles feels as if he\u2019s punched in the gut and feels the flare of protectiveness he has always felt when someone says or thinks something bad about his best friend.\nBut Derek doesn\u2019t mean it to be cruel or to judge.\nDerek\u2019s face and voice are earnest\u00a0and brutally honest. \u201cYou\u2019ve always chosen what you think is best, Stiles. It might not be what people think is good or moral, but that\u2019s because you know we can\u2019t always afford to be good when there\u2019s a hell of a lot more bad things out there.\u201d\nIt\u2019s high praise coming from Derek and it soothes Stiles a little to know that someone understands. Probably because Derek has made the same hard decisions again and again and again.\nStiles remembers a quote he once read:\u00a0'The closer one gets to the light, the greater the shadow he casts.'\nNobody wants to think of themselves as bad people and walk the 'dark' path, but Stiles and Derek don\u2019t really care about that. They know they can\u2019t afford to, so they\u2019ll willingly walk the fine, gray line between Life and Death when others don\u2019t want to, so that others won\u2019t have to.\nStiles has never thought of\u00a0himself as a good guy anyway.\nHe feels immensely tired all of a sudden and he sags, head landing on Derek\u2019s shoulder.\nDerek doesn\u2019t say a word. He just wraps his arms around Stiles and pulls him closer, lets Stiles soak up his warmth and be comforted by his strong, sturdy frame.\nDerek smells like the woods and himself and he rubs Stiles\u2019 back up and down. It\u2019s soothing and Stiles doesn\u2019t feel like the back of his eyes are burning from unshed tears.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles\u2019 Dad never asked Stiles why he chose Derek as his Alpha and Stiles knows he never will. He had only asked something like it once, when John asked about what happened between him and Scott.\n\u201cWe had a difference of opinion,\u201d Stiles says.\n\u201cAnd you and Derek don\u2019t?\u201d John asks.\nStiles snorts, unable to help it. \u201cWe do. Derek and I have divided opinions on a lot of things. It\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d He pauses, not quite sure how to put it.\n\u201cDerek understands.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, Dad,\u201d Stiles suddenly says, as he\u2019s struck with a sudden thought. \u201cYou\u2026 you and Melissa\u2026 I\u2026 being in different packs\u2026\u201d\nThe only thing he thinks he truly regrets is how he takes away a future that his father could have had. He knew what was building between his Dad and Melissa, had actively encouraged it actually, but now, torn between two packs\u2026\n\u201cJust another thing I messed up,\u201d he mutters.\n\u201cSon, you didn\u2019t mess that up, not when it isn\u2019t your decision to make in the first place.\u201d John shakes his head, expression soft.\n\u201cYou know, people always say that there is no choice when it comes to family, Stiles. You have to love your child, you have to love your parents, you have to pick them over everybody else,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I realized\u2026 you do choose your family.\"\n\u201cYou choose to stick with them even when the going gets tough, or you choose to abandon them. You choose to hate them or you choose to love them. You choose Derek and the pack and form a family of your own, or\u2026\u201d John gulps audibly and his eyes look liquid, \u201c\u2026 or you stick with an old man who, after your Mom died, forced you to grow up because he chose a beer bottle and his deputies for company instead of his own son\u2013\u201d\nStiles jolts, eyes wide. \u201cDad\u2026 I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd, only eight years old, you chose to forgive your old man instead of hate him,\u201d John continues. \u201cYou always chose family, son. You always choose me, every single day, even if I don\u2019t deserve it. And now you found a family of your own where I\u2019m lacking.\u201d\nStiles grabs his hand and squeezes it as tight as his throat feels. \u201cI would never pick the pack, pick anybody, over you, Dad. I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know, and I won\u2019t take them away from you, son.\u201d John holds Stiles\u2019 hands and squeezes them back, just as tight. \u201cSo this isn\u2019t about me. This isn\u2019t about you taking something away from me. Because I choose you. I\u2019ll follow you, and not because you\u2019re my son, but because you\u2019re my son and I love you and I trust in the choices you make. You have a pack now, and nothing will please this old man more if you think I\u2019m good enough to be a part of that.\u201d\nStiles doesn\u2019t pretend that he didn\u2019t bawl like a baby over that or that his Dad didn\u2019t break down as well.\nAnd now Stiles leans against the doorway, watches his Dad and Derek talk about some case files and debate which ones are likely related to the supernatural and which ones aren\u2019t. Boyd is in the kitchen fixing up the lasagna because he\u2019s actually a great cook, while Erica and Isaac, both too lazy to help, are in the living room debating over what channel to watch.\nDerek catches his eye and for the first time in a long while, Stiles doesn\u2019t find it hard to smile.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLydia approaches him two months after Stiles accepted the pack bite. She, Danny, and Jackson have been standing in the sidelines during most of the mess, and she serves as the Alpha of sorts in their little three-person pack. Derek hasn\u2019t tried to sway them to his side, but Allison has in Scott\u2019s stead. Stiles has seen her talking to Lydia a few times, though neither of them look happy when they part ways.\nStiles is unlocking his jeep when he feels a presence behind him. He turns around.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Lydia asks.\nIt\u2019s a boatload of questions packed into a single word.\nLydia looks like she hasn\u2019t slept in weeks, months even, and she doesn\u2019t look half as composed as she usually is. Stiles feels for her.\nDerek explained it to Stiles once, why he thought it was unwise to force Lydia into obedience.\nIt\u2019s because deep down Lydia doesn\u2019t want to get involved. It isn\u2019t even about Peter really, though it may play a part. Rather it\u2019s because Lydia carries a deep fear of being stuck here, here where nightmares are real and where she feels less in control than anywhere else in her entire life.\nDerek sympathizes. It\u2019s not like he himself has fond memories of this place, not anymore. It\u2019s not like he has ever had control of his own life ever since the fire.\nSo right now, Stiles answers\u00a0Lydia\u00a0honestly.\n\u201cI chose this life knowing things aren\u2019t exactly safe or sane or good, that I can get killed at any moment, that there will be times I\u2019d have to make the tough calls and wouldn\u2019t be able to look at myself in the mirror after. Seriously, Lyds, there are only a few really good things about this life.\u201d\n\u201cBut being a part of this makes me feel alive. A part of me still feels as if, no matter how much I hate it sometimes, this place and these people are worth it.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cI found a cause to fight for, and that\u2019s not something I can get from a degree or from moving to the other side of the country.\u201d\nStiles rubs his chin. \u201c\u2026Not that Derek is limiting the pack. He\u2019s pushing a lot of us to go spread our wings after graduation, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\u201cDerek.\u201d Lydia\u2019s eyes narrow.\nStiles reads her next question in the glint in her eye.\n\u201cWhy him?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cI chose to be Derek\u2019s because I have faith in him,\u201d Stiles says, easy and simple as if he is merely talking about the weather, as if his words were something just as natural. \u201cI have just as much faith in Scott. Don\u2019t get me wrong. But you know what the difference is between them?\u201d\nLydia doesn\u2019t speak and Stiles plows on, voice lowering into a whisper.\n\u201cI can choose to kill someone, because I think it\u2019s what\u2019s right. I can fight dirty. I can dive off the deep end. I can stick a knife in Derek\u2019s chest. I can walk away from this any time I want. But at the end of the day, I know Derek will still have faith in me.\u201d\n\u201cThis is insane,\u201d Lydia hisses. She looks conflicted and Stiles wonders if that is not the answer she wants or expects.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to ask you to be a part of this, but please respect my choice.\u201d Stiles turns his back on her, but looks over his shoulder one last time. \u201cI picked an Alpha and a pack that would pick me right back. I hope you find people who will do the same for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA day later, Jackson shows up at the loft and requests the pack bite. Derek isn\u2019t swayed no matter how many times he asks.\nThree days later, Danny shows up to \u2018hang out.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t say a word about a turning bite or a pack bite and Derek lets him make camp.\nA week later, when it\u2019s almost midnight, Lydia knocks on the door. She\u2019s in a tight dress and her makeup is flawless. She looks made up and battle ready.\nWhen morning comes, Stiles feels three more pack bonds snap into place.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDerek kisses Stiles not long after that, when the pack gathers to celebrate Stiles\u2019 eighteenth birthday and Cora finally comes home.\nIt dawned on a Sunday and the pack, his Dad included, have been in his house since morning, scattered around the living room with the remains of all the spaghetti and meatballs, burgers, pizza, potato salad, and ice cream and cupcakes they\u2019ve been eating the whole day. Lydia had brought all of it for Stiles using Derek\u2019s credit card. Stiles would be embarrassed, but Lydia wasn\u2019t and he is not about to belittle Derek\u2019s need to provide for his pack, or his pack's near-insatiable appetite.\nCora is among them, having gone back to Beacon Hills because she\u2019s bored of traveling. Stiles thinks it\u2019s because she misses Derek and the pack, despite all the mess that has happened.\nThey all welcomed her easily. It\u2019s as if she never left.\nThe gifts come after dinner and Stiles sits on the couch beside Derek as boxes are piled on his lap. He opens each one to the pack\u2019s raucous cheers and Stiles feels thankful for their generosity: a gift certificate for some new sneakers and pants from his Dad; graphic tees and a hoodie from Isaac, Erica, and Boyd; a leather messenger bag from Lydia; a watch from Jackson, which he probably just swiped from his own collection; CDs from Danny; and even Cora hands him a gift, a protection necklace she found on her travel.\nDerek ends up last and he gives Stiles a small book wrapped in soft, green paper.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a journal,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s magic,\u201d Stiles adds, feels the tips of his fingers tingle as he strokes the black, leather cover. His Spark, young and small as it was, writhes in glee at the magic \u2013 his Spark is something Deaton only alluded to once, but he\u2019s been training it with the pack\u2019s help, Derek's contacts, and Lydia\u2019s experiments.\n\u201cWhat kind of magic?\u201d he asks his Alpha.\n\u201cIt will never run out of pages, among other things.\u201d Derek smiles, pleased that Stiles likes his gift. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who\u2019ll be able to write on it and you can choose who can read it.\u201d\n\u201cWoah, sounds cool!\u201d Isaac exclaims.\n\u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d Cora asked.\n\u201cA friend,\u201d Derek says. They share a look. Cora nods, like she knows who he\u2019s talking about.\nErica makes grabby hands at him. \u201cLet\u2019s try it out!\u201d\nJohn hands them some pens from the side table, curious over the magic book. Everyone takes turns trying to make a mark on the pages and look flabbergasted when none of them make a mark nor a dent. When it\u2019s Stiles\u2019 turn, they all oohed and aahed when they see his spindly handwriting appear across the page.\nStiles lets them play around with it and retreats to the kitchen, bringing along some plates and mugs.\nSuddenly, it hits him; that this is the first time in a long time he celebrated a birthday without Scott.\nStiles scrambles for his phone. He left it on the counter earlier when the pack started coming in. He feels a firm hand on his shoulder and it doesn\u2019t surprise him that it\u2019s Derek.\nThere\u2019s no text and Stiles almost cries.\nSuddenly, it rings in his palm and the hand on his shoulder squeezes.\n\nhappy bday. have a good one.\n\nIt\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s something.\n\u201cLike a damn mind reader,\u201d Stiles mutters. He shrugs off Derek\u2019s hand and starts putting everything into the sink.\n\u201cI have another present for you,\u201d Derek says, breaking the suddenly solemn mood. Stiles\u2019 head whips up in excitement \u2013 and no small amount of relief at the distraction.\nDerek smiles. \u201cMy present to you is saying: you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cI know I am! Er\u2026\u201d Stiles purses his lips. \u201cAbout what?\u201d\nDerek pulls out the keys to the Camaro. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a drive.\u201d\nJohn and the pack stay behind, claims that Derek\u2019s already shown them the present. It confuses Stiles even more, but he willingly follows his Alpha out the door.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll love it, Stilinski,\u201d Cora says, smirking.\nThe wind is cool on Stiles\u2019 face as he looks out the window. Derek\u2019s obviously taking the long way around and Stiles laughs and points out places he and the pack like to hang out. Derek is mostly silent on the drive, but it isn\u2019t awkward and Stiles finds himself and his Spark lulled into dozing by their Alpha\u2019s presence.\nSoon enough, the Camaro stops and Stiles jolts into alertness. He looks at Derek, notes his encouraging smile, and then looks out, sees the car light up something across the way.\nThey\u2019re at the old Hale House.\nCorrection: They are where the old Hale House used to be.\nStiles\u2019 breath hitches in his throat. Derek turns off the engine and gets out of the car. Stiles stumbles to follow. They lean against the hood of the Camaro looking up.\nBecause in place of the old house was a new one; a pack house. Granted that it\u2019s less than halfway done and is still under construction.\n\u201cLike I said,\u201d Derek grins, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\nStiles is only half-right. He has been not-so-subtly hinting that Derek should find a new place for his pack. He wasn\u2019t thinking about a new house, not one on Hale land at least, and Derek delivered more than that.\nTearing down the old house for this new one isn\u2019t just something Derek would do because Stiles pestered him into it. In fact, Derek wouldn\u2019t have done it even if Stiles actually pushed him to do it - not that Stiles would.\nThis means something.\n\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d Derek says cheekily and despite the sadness and melancholy hanging over their heads, his smile is real.\n\u201cHow did you even keep this a secret from me?\u201d Stiles bumps their shoulders together. \u201cHow did I not even notice?\u201d\nDerek chuckles and Stiles thinks it\u2019s a nice sound.\n\u201cYour Dad, Cora, Lydia and Danny are the only ones who knew.\u201d At Stiles\u2019 affronted look, Derek chuckles. \u201cWhen I got the idea, I needed help. I brought Cora here before it was torn down and then I brought everyone else yesterday so they could see it. Now it\u2019s your turn. I wanted the skeleton ready in time for your birthday, just thought it\u2019d make a nice surprise.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes are beautiful in the moonlight and it makes Stiles\u2019 chest hurt in a good way.\n\u201cWhy did you bring me here, Derek?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy am I last to see this?\u201d\n\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Derek looks bashful, but he is honest. \u201cBecause having you see it, it makes it more real.\u201d He turns to the new house, a sign of good things to come if Stiles has ever seen one. \u201cBecause it means something when you know.\u201d\nThat Derek\u2019s moving on, little by little.\nThat Derek doesn\u2019t think his future\u2019s bleak.\nThat Derek feels hopeful.\nWarmth blooms in Stiles\u2019 core and when Derek leans forward, he nods and lets Derek kiss him sweet and slow. Stiles twines their fingers and gets lost in the kiss.\nIt\u2019s probably the best birthday he\u2019s ever had.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor all the drama they\u2019re facing, that didn\u2019t mean the action stopped all over Beacon Hills.\nThis time it\u2019s a clan of pixies, vicious little things that can fit in the palm of Stiles\u2019 hand, but had razor-sharp teeth that can chew through skin and muscles in seconds. Stiles and Lydia had done their research and Cora, who experienced the same thing in her travels, recounts her own experience.\nPixies are pests, are quick to multiply, and are considered savage. They have no set of laws, recognize no authority apart from a Pixie Queen, take offense over the slightest things, and have a tendency to attack anything that encroaches on their territory. Now they\u2019re staking a claim in the forest and the pack wants them out.\nDerek wanted to eliminate them. Stiles agreed.\nThe pack got the job done in an hour, quick enough that Scott and his pack arrive only to see the last of them escape in a screaming, wounded mess. He\u2019s backed by Allison and \u2013 Stiles can\u2019t say he\u2019s surprised really \u2013 Kira and Liam.\u00a0\n\u201cEverything\u2019s been taken care of,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cI see.\u201d Scott tries, but Stiles still sees the face he tries not to make and the way his jaw stiffens as he looks at the carnage. \u201cYou let some of them go?\u201d\n\u201cNone of them will last long anyway,\u201d Jackson says, studying his nails and making a face.\nAllison\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cPixies have something of a hive mind,\u201d Lydia says. She doesn\u2019t flinch under Allison\u2019s assessing gaze. \u201cWithout their Queen, they\u2019re pretty much brain dead. They\u2019ll either die or get picked apart by animals.\u201d\nKira, obviously so new to this, makes a noise, wide-eyed in shock and fascination. Liam doesn\u2019t seem impressed. He just seems angry.\nIt clicks in Stiles\u2019 head. He turns to Derek, panicked, and Derek frowns back. He notices it as well.\nIt makes Stiles see red. He steps forward and all the werewolves twitch in his direction, obviously\u00a0feeling and smelling\u00a0his rage.\n\u201cYou bit him?\u201d he hissed, glaring at Scott. \u201cYOU BIT HIM!?\u201d\nScott has the grace to look ashamed for a moment, but he remains unrepentant by the way he tilts his head.\nCora sees it too and scoffs loudly as she wipes her bloody claws on the grass. \u201cWow. Nice going McCall.\u201d\nScott growls at her, but it has no effect as he\u2019s not her Alpha. Cora growls back and stops only when Derek steps between them.\nThe beta in question, Liam, flashes his eyes at them and snarls. He only ceases when Scott places a hand on the back of his neck.\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t, he would have died.\u201d He says nothing else to explain and it makes Stiles even angrier.\nStiles is shaking and he wants nothing more than to rage, to shout, and everyone knows it. Before he can, Derek steps in.\n\u201cYou need to train him, Scott,\u201d is all Derek says and Stiles knows his Alpha remains diplomatic only because Stiles is already freaking out enough for the both of them.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that?\u201d Scott hisses.\nDerek doesn\u2019t flinch. \u201cTrain him better than I did you, and if you need help\u2013\u201d\nScott turns away. \u201cI have my own pack. Worry about your own.\u201d\nStiles can\u2019t help speaking up. He rounds on Allison. \u201cYou let him?\u201d He thought she would have had more sense.\n\u201cHe has a good reason to,\u201d Allison says. Stiles is sure her heart remains steady with no lies\u00a0only because she\u2019s a hunter, yet\u00a0Stiles knows that deep down not even she believes it.\nThey walk away, dragging an angry, out-of-control Liam with them. Only Kira looks back, looking worried and unsure.\nStiles knows they\u2019re out of earshot once the others start speaking up.\nDanny is as frank as ever. \u201cDoes McCall even understand what he\u2019s getting into? I mean, he\u2019s not a bad guy, but he\u2019s never struck me as the brightest bulb out there.\u201d\n\u201cDerek wasn\u2019t the nicest Alpha in the beginning, but even he told us that you could die if the bite doesn\u2019t take,\u201d Isaac says. Derek winces at the reminder of his awful, early days, but Isaac smiles, obviously\u00a0meaning\u00a0that the present is different.\n\u201cThat new one doesn\u2019t seem to be in control and he probably doesn't\u00a0have a stable anchor yet,\u201d Boyd says, and he actually has room to talk. He\u2019s got the best control out of them all, even more than Cora, though not as well as Derek.\n\u201cHow can Scott even train a new beta if he didn\u2019t even finish training with you?\u201d Lydia says. She flicks a hand at Derek. \u201cI mean, your old training methods leave a lot to be desired \u2013 but they\u2019re better now because you have me, so you\u2019re welcome \u2013 so how\u2019s that one even going to take care of the baby?\u201d\n\u201cHe probably just bit the kid, kidnapped him, and forced him into his pack,\u201d Cora says, making Erica snort in derision. \u201cIt\u2019s not our problem. That Argent girl is there to shoot them down anyway.\u201d\nStiles, and most of them really, flinches at the implication. Derek glares his sister into silence and she sighs and shuts up.\n\u201cScott has enough control and he\u2019s not stupid,\u201d Derek says and Stiles knows he honestly believes that. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t turn him away if he needs help.\u201d\nHe says that last part to Stiles. It is reassuring, just a little, but Stiles knows the question is whether or not Scott will even ask.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s ironic though?\u201d Erica pipes up. \u201cScott hates being a werewolf. He certainly never liked any of us.\u201d She motions to the first beta trio. \u201cThinks of it a curse or a monster or whatever. Now he\u2019s biting people to build a pack.\u201d\n\u201cHe probably has his reasons,\u201d Derek says, tries to be soothing. \u201cNot all bites are transformative. We all know that. Scott is\u2026 I don\u2019t think he\u2019s foolish enough that he won\u2019t know when to offer the bite and when not to.\u201d\nStiles laughs, a small, pained, disbelieving thing. He looks to Derek.\n\u201cDoes he? Does he really?\u201d\nIf Stiles is so unsure about Scott\u2026\nNone of them, not even Derek, has an answer to that.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are my emissary.\u201d\nDerek says it on a rather overcast Tuesday afternoon. The pack had been working on the house since early morning, but now they\u2019re all on break and are scattered across the back porch.\nLydia, who was doing Erica\u2019s nails, scoffs. \u201cAnd you only figured that out now?\u201d\nFrom his sprawl across the wooden floor, Stiles tilts his head up and looks at Derek upside-down as the Alpha leans against one of the posts.\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed he came by that realization himself,\u201d Stiles teases, grinning. Cora laughs loudly at that.\n\u201cDerry can\u2019t help it if it\u2019s a bit slow,\u201d Erica says and giggles in the face of Derek\u2019s growl.\n\u201cIt was obvious,\u201d Danny shrugs. Isaac nods excitedly, while Jackson scoffs and pretends to look bored and uncaring.\n\u201cIt makes sense,\u201d Boyd adds.\nDerek looks miffed, but more than that he looks mystified. He sits down by Stiles\u2019 head, until the Alpha and Emissary are looking at one another upside-down.\n\u201cYou are my emissary,\u201d Derek says again, softly and privately.\nIt is both a declaration and a confession. It is acknowledging Stiles\u2019 position in the pack and, at the same time, it\u2019s also admitting Derek\u2019s dependence on, need for, him. It is the reality not just of Stiles\u2019 ability to protect them and help them flourish, but also a sign of a possible future that the two of them can build together.\nBecause Stiles isn\u2019t stupid. Derek was never meant to be the Alpha and when he did he has never run his pack \u2013 doesn\u2019t know how to run his pack actually, Stiles thinks \u2013 the way an Alpha should, the way his mother did. Derek learned to make sense of his Alpha-hood by his mistakes, learned how to make his own rules because he has no one to tell him how.\nSo Derek will never choose an emissary bound by rules and laws, not one like Deaton who remains cryptic and secretive, preaches balance when the world has proven itself to tilt far to the left, or chooses logic when there is so many on this earth that is unforgiving and cruel.\nDerek will choose an emissary who knows the laws best, but knows even better how to break it, wants to break it, someone who will not keep secrets for the sake of keeping them, someone who is unbalanced and recognizes the world as the same.\nSomeone Derek knows will never lead him astray, someone he trusts and loves beyond all else.\nSo of course Derek won\u2019t make the sensible choice.\nHe\u2019ll choose the Sheriff\u2019s law-breaking son. How ironic.\nStiles grins. \u201cI am your emissary,\u201d he agrees, easy as breathing.\nDerek\u2019s eyes flare Alpha-red and Stiles feels the pack bond and his Spark snap taut as he accepts his fate. Around them, the pack shudders and lets out little yips and giggles of joy.\nStiles can\u2019t help it. He bares his teeth and feels his eyes flash \u2013 light violet, a color he will later learn the significance of.\nStiles Stilinski; Hale Pack emissary and the Alpha\u2019s\u2026 well, that might be a bit too early to decide on.\nBut right now, at this moment, Stiles\u2019 entire future seems bright and exciting.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nScott is already at the lacrosse field when Stiles arrives, twirling his crosse and tossing a ball around. Stiles wordlessly hefts his own crosse and joins him.\nThey toss the ball back and forth for a while, throwing it harder and farther every few minutes, until an hour and a half passes and they\u2019re lying on the grass upside down from one another, trying to catch their breaths. The sun is setting and it\u2019s getting dark. The grass is cool against their skin and the air even cooler.\nStiles remembers a time, more than a decade ago on this date, when two four-year-olds became good friends after playing together in the sandbox.\nIt seems far too long ago.\nScott breaks the silence as Stiles\u2019 usual talkativeness doesn\u2019t seem to be on board today.\n\u201cViolet. Deaton told me about that.\u201d\nAs if Deaton ever really tells people anything, but Stiles stops himself from making that remark.\n\u201cViolet eyes, an alpha mate.\u201d\nStiles senses Scott tilt his head to the side and stare at him, but he doesn\u2019t look back.\n\u201cDeaton says it\u2019s permanent.\u201d\nStiles just shrugs. Permanent for the wolf, maybe, but not the human, though to Stiles, it\u2019s as good as permanent too. He keeps his mouth shut. Stiles isn\u2019t really willing to share that information anyway.\n\u201cMate or not, I won\u2019t ever take the bite,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI don\u2019t plan to, and even if I\u2019m about to die, Derek knows it\u2019s still a 50-50 thing.\u201d\nScott makes a face at the thought of Stiles dying, and he says, \u201cI know. I know you never wanted this.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Scottie. I never planned for this to happen and maybe I kept complaining at first, but\u2026\u201d He turns his head and looks Scott in the eye. \u201cI\u2019ve never ran away from this. As hard as it is, this kind of life\u2026\u201d He trails off.\nIt\u2019s not that Stiles wants this, but at the same time, this life\u2026 it just seems more.\nScott seems to get it. He looks back up at the sky. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t. It was hard enough before without all this, but it was better.\u201d\nOthers will think the notion is laughable, but Stiles gets it. Despite the lack of strength and speed and healing, being part of the supernatural world makes you realize just how precious it really is to be human.\n\u201cBad enough I had to suddenly be a werewolf, but now we end up in different packs,\u201d Scott continues. Stiles hears the anger in his voice and right now, he\u2019s not quite sure to whom it was directed, at Stiles? At himself? At the world?\nStiles is tired of wondering.\n\u201cYou will always be my brother, Scott, and one of my best friends, even if\u2026\u201d He trails off. \u201cBut I guess we\u2019ll never be pack. I\u2019m sorry it had to turn out this way.\u201d\nScott gives him a look and for one moment Stiles remembers how it was: asthmatic, knuckleheaded Scott and the fidgety, weirdo Stiles.\n\u201cMe too. Sorry,\u201d Scott says. He sits up and grabs his crosse.\nStiles doesn\u2019t watch as he walks away.\nStiles stays there until the sky is dark and stars start dotting the night sky. He lifts a hand up, looks at the sky through the spaces between his fingers, isn\u2019t surprised when he finds thicker, darker fingers slot between his.\nDerek\u2019s concerned face appears above him and Stiles smiles, knows it wobbles uncertainly on his face.\n\u201cCome on. You\u2019ll get a cold,\u201d his Alpha, his mate, says.\nStiles nods, lets Derek drag him up, bundle him warmly into the Camaro and then take him home.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut Stiles doesn\u2019t come home to the pack house. He can\u2019t. He knows he won\u2019t find solace there.\nWhen he says this, Derek nods and wordlessly drops him off at the Stilinski house. Stiles sees Derek off with a hug, a kiss, and a promise to call, and then crawls into his Dad\u2019s bed at three in the morning, cold and still smelling of the woods. He hasn\u2019t done this in more than a decade.\nNonetheless, his Dad opens one eye blearily and grumbles only a little before he scoots over and lets his son lie down beside him. He opens his arms easily and lets his son curl up against his side, never mind that he is older now and too tall with too long, too jittery limbs.\nIt\u2019s a kind of comfort only his Dad can give. His Dad who knows Stiles better than anyone else, who knows how lonely Stiles felt being the weird kid with the ADHD, who knows how happy Stiles was when he finally found Scott, who understands the way Stiles\u2019 heart is breaking right now.\nJohn shushes his son and gently rubs his back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, son. Let it out.\u201d\nStiles cries, pained and inconsolable, and his Dad doesn\u2019t once let go of him.\nHe wakes up a few hours later hearing his Dad call in a family emergency and informs the station he isn\u2019t coming in today.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Stiles croaks.\nJohn rubs his son\u2019s head and continues the call and Stiles is left to curl against his side, feeling awful but also relieved. After the call, John just sits beside him, rubbing his head comfortingly until Stiles finds himself drifting away.\nHe wakes up a second time to his Dad still in bed with him and reading the newspaper. By the way one hand moves to rub his head some more, it\u2019s obvious he knows Stiles\u2019 awake.\nIt\u2019s silent, apart from the rustle of the paper and the sound of people outside going about their day.\nStiles\u2019 voice is a whisper. \u201cIt isn\u2019t fair.\u201d\nJohn puts down the newspaper, looks down at him and Stiles wants to cry from the look in his eyes.\n\u201cLife is never fair, son.\u201d\nTears escape and Stiles sniffs, looks up at his Dad through watery eyes. \u201cI lost him, Dad.\u201d\nJohn looks pained and he obviously doesn\u2019t know what to say to that. To agree with him would just hurt more, and to deny it would be a lie.\n\u201cSon, the people who are meant to be in our life will always come back, no matter how far they wander.\u201d\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll come back,\u201d Stiles whispers.\n\u201cThen you will have lost a friend, but you will move on,\u201d John says firmly. \u201cPeople and relationships don\u2019t last forever, son. You will cry and you will miss him, but you will move on one day.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t comfort Stiles, not really, but it\u2019s a painful reality he would have accepted only from his Dad and no one else.\nIt still makes him angry.\nStiles sits up, fury burning through his veins. This is the first time he\u2019s been truly angry over this.\n\u201cI\u2019m his best friend, Dad! I\u2019ve always had his back! And the one time I needed him, he didn\u2019t believe me! All I\u2019ve ever wanted was to protect the town! Why can\u2019t he see that? Why do I have to suddenly be the bad guy just because I don\u2019t want more people to die? Does he think I enjoy this? That when I dragged him into the woods, I wanted all of this to happen? But we\u2019re in this already and I\u2019m in this for the long haul and I\u2019m just\u2026 doing\u2026 my\u2026 best\u2026\u201d\nStiles doesn\u2019t cry. He\u2019s a bit dried up at the moment, but his chest feels tight and he would have spiraled into a panic attack if his Dad didn\u2019t reach out, hold his hands tightly, and started breathing loudly.\n\u201cI hate this. I hate him.\u201d\nIt's a blatant lie.\nJohn doesn\u2019t say a word, only speaks after a few moments of breathing and helping his son calm down.\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for him, but I\u2019m sure Scott just wants to protect this town too. It\u2019s just that sometimes we make choices that take us different places, and the people we want to bring with us don\u2019t always choose that same path, Stiles,\" he says.\u00a0\"There is nothing more awful in this world than doubt, and I\u2019m sorry it had to happen to your friendship, but none of these makes either of you bad people, son, just different people.\u201d\nStiles remembers that conversation in the field. His Dad is right.\n\u201cI\u2026 I never wanted this to happen,\u201d Stiles says, and he feels his heart break all over again.\n\u201cI know,\u201d John says, and his face crumples a little. He hugs his son tightly. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo Stiles does the one thing he can.\nThe research takes him a little over half a year, even with Lydia and Danny to help him. He keeps it from the others for now, most of all from Derek. It\u2019s not hard. Being their Emissary, he has the right to ask for privacy.\n\u2026and besides, none of them question him, most of all Derek.\nHe finishes it just two months before graduation. Just in time. Stiles wonders if the universe didn\u2019t somehow plan this.\nThe bed is warm and Derek is sleepy when Stiles lies down beside him. Derek opens his arms, easy and trusting, and Stiles slides between them, comforted and loved.\n\u201cThe full moon is next week,\u201d Stiles says, fingers stroking the broad chest before him and tangling in the chest hair. \u201cIt\u2019s ready.\u201d\nDerek isn\u2019t even jolted awake, just nods and sighs and presses a kiss to Stiles\u2019 lips.\n\u201cOkay. Just tell me what to do.\u201d\nStiles nods and snuggles in to sleep.\nYears back, he dragged Scott into the woods and changed their lives forever.\nScott wants to walk away, Stiles knows that.\nSo Stiles will let him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe full moon hung fat and bright over their heads and the forest is eerily silent\u2026 or it would be if it doesn\u2019t sound like a herd of elephants are trampling across the forest floor. Behind Stiles, the pack is snickering and unimpressed. He has half a mind to berate them, especially the humongous, black wolf beside him that is doing nothing more than sit there and look bored.\nBut Stiles knows part of Derek is enjoying this. Derek trains his betas with an iron fist and a kind heart and they all learned, even Stiles, how to move as one with the forest that is their home. Scott has done the same for his pack, but not as effectively. Scott has never learned to recognize the forest and claim this territory as his.\nHe doesn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s not his to claim anyway.\nStiles strokes one of Derek\u2019s wolf ears, smiles when it twitches between his fingers. Derek leans up and licks his hand, but Stiles shakes his head.\n\u201cNot yet. We have to wait, babe.\u201d\nDerek growls, but it sounds more like a sigh.\nDerek has another reason to celebrate, but that comes later. He knows there is a secret Stiles and the pack are keeping from him, a secret that is important tonight of all nights, but it doesn\u2019t make him uneasy, just impatient. Derek is always impatient anyway.\nThe McCall pack emerges from the shadows, Scott at the helm with his betas at his back and, most unsurprising, is Deaton by Scott\u2019s right. Scott is in his beta form \u2013 he\u2019ll never achieve a full wolf like Derek \u2013 and his eyes are furiously Alpha-red. Allison has her crossbow at the ready. The others are all in battle-ready forms, some of them Stiles recognizes and most he doesn\u2019t.\nDeaton remains quiet and blank-faced, but Stiles can sense him. He is armed with virtually every talisman, charm, and spell possible. Stiles almost smirks because he doesn\u2019t need any one of those. All he needs is his pack, the gleam of the Mother Moon, and his mate, and he is unstoppable.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Scott snarls, crouching low and looking ready to attack.\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a moonlight run, McCall,\u201d Erica answers, scoffing. \u201cYou\u2019re the one intruding on our territory.\u201d\nScott growls at her, but it\u2019s Allison who speaks, aiming her crossbow at them. \u201cWe\u2019re not intruding on anything, not when we know you\u2019re planning to ruin everything.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s rude,\u201d Isaac says, rolling his eyes.\n\u201cNot to mention judgmental and completely jumping to conclusions,\u201d Cora adds, looking bored from where she sits\u00a0on the forest floor beside Derek, leaning back on her hands.\n\u201cWe know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Scott says. His gaze moves to Stiles. \u201cAnd we\u2019re here to stop you.\u201d\nDerek growls and makes to move, but Stiles stands between his pack and Scott\u2019s. He\u2019s dressed in his \u2013 Derek\u2019s, really \u2013 favorite red hoodie and black jeans and he feels a buzz beneath his skin unlike anything he\u2019s felt before.\n\u201cStop us?\u201d Stiles echoes. He looks at his counterpart. \u201cDo you even know what you're stopping? Do you even have the right to?\u201d\nScott looks offended and snarls a call to arms. His betas fan out and crouch, coiled tight like springs. Allison hefts her crossbow at their direction.\nIt\u2019s obvious Deaton hasn\u2019t told Scott the extent of what tonight means. It makes Stiles angry, frustrated that Scott willingly subjects himself to the whims of an old man who hoards knowledge simply because he thinks it\u2019s what makes him above them all, who uses knowledge and secrecy as a way to force them all on the path of what he thinks is right and just and logical.\nThis is not about war, despite what Deaton has obviously implied to Scott.\nStiles keeps quiet though. He has long since learned that his opinions are never welcome.\nDerek licks his hand and it breaks Stiles from his reverie. Stiles smiles and leans down \u2013 just a little, because Derek is huge \u2013 to kiss the wolf on the nose. He turns to the pack across the way, lets his eyes flash deep violet and tries to control his thoughts.\nThere is a whizz in the air, caught by Stiles\u2019 Spark-enhanced senses and not his human\u00a0ones. It happens almost as if in slow motion: He sees Allison\u2019s arrow fly through the air, hears Derek and his wolves snarl angrily, holds Boyd back from when he tries to jump to Stiles\u2019 defense, and watches Allison\u2019s arrow break the moment it hits Stiles\u2019 barrier.\nThe other pack looks surprised, Allison most of all, while Scott looks furious and Deaton, despite how he tries to hide it, also looks wide-eyed.\n\u201cWolfsbane arrow,\u201d Boyd mutters, eyeing the arrow sniffing the air, and the pack snarls.\nStiles tries to keep himself calm, but can\u2019t. He had seen the trajectory of that arrow, headed straight for Derek\u2019s head.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare hurt my wolves, Argent,\u201d he said, voice echoing clear across the clearing. Power burns behind his eyes and he watches Allison\u2019s eyes widen. He can practically smell fear crawling up her spine before Scott stands in front of her.\nScott continues to be with a woman who will most likely kill him in his sleep, and Stiles is so angry he\u2019s tempted to laugh at such stupidity and burn them all where they stand.\nBut he doesn\u2019t, because Derek steps forward, fur brushing against Stiles\u2019 fingers, and Stiles remembers that there are far more important things that require his attention.\nStiles takes a deep breath. \u201cLet\u2019s not waste time.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d Scott growls. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Stiles.\u201d\nThis time, Stiles laughs. \u201cUs? Stupid? We\u2019re not the ones making stupid moves.\u201d He turns his back on them, despite Derek\u2019s warning growl. \u201cShall we?\u201d\nWithout warning and without a motion from Stiles, a circle of mountain ash suddenly encircles Derek. Stiles hears the trespassers gasp and growl in surprise, but the pack is used to it. Derek doesn\u2019t even flinch, just looks down at the circle and then at Stiles.\n\u201cShift for me, babe.\u201d\nThis is the difference, Stiles thinks, as he watches Derek shift easily, effortlessly and trusting. This is why Stiles, despite his many, many regrets, will never regret this choice.\nDerek is beautiful in the moonlight, stands tall and proud and unashamed. Mother Moon shines brightly upon him and his eyes are Alpha-red and intense, but only loving and fond when they settle on Stiles.\nThe entire pack moves to circle Derek; Isaac and Jackson making mocking faces at Derek\u2019s nudity; Danny, Lydia and Erica (not really) pretending to leer, and Cora making gross faces at them.\n\u201cTrust us?\u201d Stiles asks.\nDerek, vulnerable in his magical cage, doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cAlways.\u201d\nStiles pulls out a dagger, a gleaming gold blade with runes carved on the handle. He steps towards Derek, blade pointed at him. He feels Deaton shift behind him.\n\u201cTrust me?\u201d he asks.\nDerek smiles. \u201cForever.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, there is a long gash across Derek\u2019s chest, deep enough that it bleeds almost immediately.\nDerek doesn\u2019t heal.\n\u201cWhat the fucking hell is going on?\u201d one of Scott\u2019s wolves mutters \u2013 young, going by his voice, with a bit of an accent.\nDerek looks surprised but not betrayed, meets Stiles\u2019 eyes with a singular focus.\nStiles steps back and nods and immediately, the rest of the pack is upon their Alpha. Each one takes a swipe at him, one after the other, until even Derek has to wince at each claw that tears his flesh apart.\nStiles practically hears Scott\u2019s confusion.\n\u201cWhat are they doing, Deaton?\u201d Scott snarls.\nStiles tilts his had back, jaunty as he pleases. He sees the crack in Deaton\u2019s fa\u00e7ade, a mix of outrage and shock, and Stiles laughs when a strong gust of wind blows through the clearing. The forest is slowly waking up upon hearing Derek\u2019s blood call.\n\u201cA blood claim,\u201d Deaton says. \u201cThe Hale Pack emissary\u201d \u2013 and wow, he won\u2019t even say Stiles\u2019 name \u2013 \u201cis invoking his Alpha\u2019s right to claim the land.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Scott gapes.\n\u201cThis is old magic, an ancient and unstable magic,\u201d Deaton says.\nStiles laughs, loud and bright. Deaton just doesn\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201cUnstable? Says who?\u201d\nBeacon Hills is Hale territory and Derek, the last living Hale Alpha, has all the right in the world to claim it, something Deaton has kept from Derek and Laura for many, many years.\nStiles used to wonder why, but now he doesn\u2019t. He has his suspicions about Deaton\u2019s heart, and now knows the old man makes his own brand of judgment, that he\u2019s smart enough to figure out the reality of the Hale Fire and has since found Derek unworthy of the Hale land.\nSomehow Stiles understands. Deaton sees Talia whenever he looks at Derek, feels as if her son will never measure up to the greatness she had once been, or worse and feels that he is responsible for her very death.\nNow that Stiles thinks about, he suspects that\u2019s why Deaton allied himself to Scott in the first place, because here is someone he can mold into his vision of what an Alpha should be, must be. Stiles had always had little trust in the man, despite Scott\u2019s ridiculous belief in him, and now he understands that it was warranted.\nHe feels it now, suddenly, a resentment deep in his heart.\nFor the part Deaton played, knowingly and maliciously, in fracturing his and Scott\u2019s relationship.\nFor having a hand, no matter unknowing, in Laura\u2019s death and Derek\u2019s abandonment, because he refused to be the man they needed when it mattered.\nFor having kept the Hale land, Derek\u2019s birthright as the lone Hale, from him.\nHow unforgivable.\nIt is an ugly feeling, but Stiles feels him justified and frankly, he doesn't care. Like he always says, he has never considered himself a good person after all.\nBecause even at the cost of his life, his strength, his sanity, his soul, Derek chose to fight and bleed for this land, has probably done so more times than all his ancestors combined. He chose to go back to a place that is his living hell and he stays, all to help two teenagers who didn\u2019t know better. He chose to save a town wrapped in bleak and painful memories because it is the right thing to do.\nHe chose to give a home, strength, and hope to kids who needed it, when no one had offered him the same.\nHe chose to trust people, unconditionally, unending, despite how many times he\u2019s been betrayed.\nHe chose to love Stiles, with a force that is unbreakable and true, despite the fact that he hasn\u2019t been loved the way he deserved.\nEven now, as his wounds sting and his blood flows, Derek bleeds unhesitatingly for his pack and his Emissary-Mate, when so many times he has bled without consequence and reason.\nDerek could have so easily become a villain in this story, but every single day, every single moment, he chose to be a good man.\nDerek remains steadfast after the onslaught, bleeding and pained as he feels. He flinches with every shift of his shredded body, but surrenders to them, to his pack, with a trust that is burned into his very soul.\nStiles closes his eyes and calls to them, calls to every pure and good force on this old earth. And he hears them, hears the call of the land and Mother Moon.\nBecause it is in their nature to give back to one of their children, especially one that continues to fight for all the things that matter.\nGasps rang throughout the clearing and Stiles opens his eyes to see every cut on Derek's body recede as skin and muscle knit itself together, and he laughs as he feels a knife wound bloom across his own chest. He unzips his hoodie and sees his white shirt drenched with blood. It\u2019s painful, but he doesn\u2019t shy away. The same wounds they inflicted on their Alpha appear on each member of the pack, all of them bleeding and painful and not healing. They all watch it with amazement, but no one questions it or fears it.\nDerek has done far, far more for them than this.\nDerek whines, steps towards the mountain ash barrier looking worried. Stiles dissolves the barrier and lets his mate come forward, smiles reassuringly when Derek\u2019s hand hovers over his wound and his eyes flicker to each bleeding pack member.\nThis is the one thing Scott will never understand, what a gift it is to be part of a real pack, what it really means to be an Alpha, and what it means to embrace it.\nScott will never understand how much Derek has sacrificed for this, for them, for Scott himself.\nFor a few moments, Mother Moon shines brighter than she\u2019s ever done tonight and a strong wind suddenly blows through the clearing, so strong that they all have to brace themselves. A chorus of howls and gasps erupt from each person present\u00a0as the wind passes through them and Stiles knows they\u2019re feeling the same thing he is, some invisible force strongly tugging at his chest, until something cracks and breaks and gives way.\nIt brings about pain, but also something of immense relief and by the time Mother Moon dulls her shine, they are all shaking their heads to clear their visions or sinking to the ground on shaky knees. Even Derek wobbles where he stands.\nBoth Deaton and Stiles remain standing, and Stiles generously pretends not to see Deaton\u2019s right knee buckle.\n\u201cIt has been done,\u201d Stiles says, feels the real bonds snap into place, feels the land recognize its rightful Alpha, feels something in him dissolve into nothing when he looks at Scott, whose face is shocked but whose aura feels lighter than Stiles has ever sensed it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d Stiles says again.\nAnd he walks away.\nThat\u2019s it.\nThat\u2019s where it ends.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nExcept it doesn\u2019t, not really. Not for them.\nDerek finds him in the pack library a few hours later, curled up in the window seat in Derek\u2019s largest sweater. Everybody gathered in the living room earlier in a big pack pile after the full moon run and all of them are still asleep, save for Stiles who is still adjusting to the buzz under his skin and Derek who can never sleep without Stiles around.\n\u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d Derek asks, wedging himself between Stiles and the corner. Derek likes that, cradling Stiles between his legs.\n\u201cNah, I just wanted to watch the rain,\u201d Stiles said.\nHe settles back on Derek\u2019s broad chest and they watch the rain outside the window. It started pouring the moment they returned to the pack house. Derek loves the rain and it won\u2019t surprise Stiles if some force of nature willed this, a cleansing of some sort as much as a gift.\nDerek strokes Stiles\u2019 side under the enormous sweater as his other hand links their fingers together over Stiles\u2019 stomach. It\u2019s relaxing and sweet and calming and it almost calms Stiles buzzing mind.\nAlmost.\nDerek presses his lips to Stiles\u2019 neck. \u201cWhat you did today\u2026 Stiles\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf you thank me, I\u2019ll zap you,\u201d Stiles warns, laughing. It tapers off awkwardly.\nDerek strokes his side and Stiles is warm in his Alpha\u2019s embrace.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a side effect.\u201d It is as much a question as it is a statement.\nStiles thinks about Scott, how he held his head higher and his shoulders straighter, the lightness Stiles felt in Scott\u2019s aura and from his wolf.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really a side effect, because it\u2019s part of the ritual,\u201d Stiles says, playing with Derek\u2019s fingers. \u201cOnly one Alpha has the right to these lands and the magic knows it, even though things got a bit fucked up and the magic got waylaid along the way.\nHe pauses, takes a shuddering breath. \u201cScott would have always felt the pull because the magic couldn\u2019t detach itself from him. Best theory is he got it from Peter and, being a Hale, the magic recognized some sort of bond. It\u2019s been muddled though, since the both of you are Alphas and no official claiming has been made. In hindsight, that\u2019s probably what was forcing Scott to fight for your territory, even if deep inside he doesn\u2019t want it.\"\n\u201cNow, the bond has shifted to you, the rightful Alpha, so Scott doesn\u2019t have to fight for it anymore.\u201d\nIt\u2019s probably part of the reason why Scott hates Derek so much, because some kind of instinct Scott never bothered to understand feels uneasy with another Alpha on his territory. It\u2019s also probably part of the reason Scott hates Stiles, because that same instinct has drilled it into his head that Stiles betrayed him for another pack and another Alpha.\nNow that there is no pull leading Scott astray, he can go on.\nIs it selfish for Stiles to wish Scott leaves? This place has enough bad memories for the both of them, but Stiles has made its peace with it. Scott, on the other hand, will only ever resent it.\nStiles knows Deaton understands what really happened, but that he will never tell Scott the truth, the same way Scott will never question it even if he ever bothers to wonder at the way his heart and his wolf has felt lighter than it\u2019s ever been or the way he will now find it easier to walk away from it all.\n\u201cYou set him free, Stiles, and I\u2019m sorry he\u2019ll never understand that.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s voice is soft in his ear, understanding and loving.\nUntil the bitter end, Stiles fought for what was best for Scott, despite how things ended up between them. Because Stiles loves Scott, always will.\nIt will take years before Stiles stops looking back, stops wondering where he went wrong, if he could have saved Scott, could have saved himself, could have chosen differently. It will be years before he stops and wonders about that first time, that moment when he should have gone after Scott, but didn\u2019t.\nIt will take even longer for him to stop feeling partly guilty when he realizes that no, thing wouldn\u2019t have gone differently.\nBecause Scott is not a bad person, but he is blind and deaf.\nBecause Stiles is far from blind or deaf, but he has never considered himself a good person, only human.\nBecause Stiles is the type of person who has very few regrets in his life and not one of them is choosing the gray path and letting Scott go, not one of them is choosing\u00a0Derek when the man endured so much for a young Alpha who doesn\u2019t know how to value all that sacrifice.\nDerek understands and does not begrudge Stiles his grief or his demons, never.\nHe understands, and Stiles loves his mate all the more.\nSo right here, right now, Stiles lets himself fall apart in Derek\u2019s arms. He grieves for a brother he lost, mourns his broken heart and battered spirit, and cries for a future he lost and a new one he gained.\nOutside, the rain falls steady and sure, and the land sings."
