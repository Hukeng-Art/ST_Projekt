    "notes": "<p>I was going to have this as just one chapter, but it ended up being super long so I'm splitting it up. Here is part one.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>So, I was going to have this as just two parts, but I underestimated how long it would be. See, the problem with me is that I have the entire story, from beginning to end, already written in my head before I even write my first word on paper, and my head doesn't have page numbers. So when I thought I had divided the story in half when I finished part one, I actually only had about a fourth of it down. Seriously, this next chapter is a few pages shy of being twice the length of chapter one. So it will be three chapters, instead of two. Also, I went back and fixed all the spelling and grammatical errors in the first chapter. I'm actually really embarrassed as to how many there were. I swear I proofread; I just don't always catch everything before it's published. Also, the \"&amp;\" \"g\" \"t;\" in the tags was supposed to be a greater than sign, but it didn't come out that way and whenever I try to fix it, it reorders my tags so they don't make sense. Thanks to everyone that commented, left kudos, and just plain read it!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>When I first thought up this story, there were some things I knew that I wanted in it immediately. 1) I wanted the base story line to follow that of the original comic. There would be some things I changed for plot reasons, but the main core of it would be the same. This is both as a tribute to comic-canon, and because they did a really good job on that comic. 2) I wanted Peter's past to be leaked to the public. The reason the comic was created in the first place was to spread awareness about sexual abuse, and the prevention of it. I wanted the same thing to happen - in the Marvel Universe. By leaking it to the public, it would bring awareness. Personally, I hope that they incorporate this aspect of Spider-Man's backstory into the Tom Holland version, because the necessity to raise awareness is still there, and with Spider-Man being such a beloved aspect of Marvel, and with how many people view these films, it would spread awareness better than the comic ever did. 3) I wanted to have something else happening in the background, even if it was just a glimpse of the issue. In real life, Peter wouldn't have gotten some kind of break from the rest of the world while he dealt with this; he would still have to deal with his other problems in life no matter how difficult it got. The Sokovia Accords were an obvious choice, because that's the only thing we've seen him do in the Marvel Universe. And, before you all accuse me of being Team Cap, I'm not. I'm Team These People are All Idiots. Everyone is in the wrong. The Captain cannot just trample across borders as if they're not there - and he should know better, they still had borders in the 40s. But the Accords are so, so stupid. It doesn't matter whether or not you agree about the oversight, the Accords are still stupid, and unsustainable. It basically enslaves heroes to the whims of the panel, and tramples on Civil Rights as it does so. Since these movies started to come out, people seem to be of the opinion SHIELD or the other government organizations can wave their hands and make anything happen, regardless of laws or fundamental rights. Speaking as someone who's recently been forced to study the Supreme Court and Civil Rights cases, they can't do that and get away with it forever. I'm not a lawyer, so I apologize now for any faults in the statements made by Foggy, Matt, and Karen. They come from things I learned in AP Gov and AP US History, and also from \"Why the Sokovia Accords are Unconstitutional,\" by Legal Geeks. I don't know how to embed URLs onto this thing, so you'll just have to Google it if you want to read that. 4) I wanted to flip between Peter in present time and Peter when he was still under the control of Skip, to show the parallelism between the two. So yeah, that's why every other little segment is from the perspective of seven-year-old Peter. It is also one of the reasons this thing is so long. 5) I wanted Spider-Man's story to help people speak out. More on that next chapter. Thanks for reading!</p>\n<p>At long last, I have finished this. Thank you to everyone that read for their ever lasting support; I really appreciate it. Honestly, I freaked every time I got an alert about this story. It was basically me internally flailing about, mentally screaming \"I'm touching people! With words!\" as I read the amazing comments I received. I will never be able to express how grateful I am for the response this story has gotten. I have received a request for extensions on certain scenes, such as Stark firing Jameson and whatnot. There are certain events in this story that I would have loved to depict, but didn't because the story was from Peter's perspective and they occurred without him there. If y'all are interested in seeing those in an extension of this fic, like a deleted scenes type thing, let me know in the comments. If not, let me know that too. Basically, it will happen or not based on your vote. I didn't proofread this chapter as carefully as I otherwise would have, because I wanted to finally update this, so I promise I'll spend the next few days combing the chapters for all those mistakes I missed. Now, without further ado, the last chapter:</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>When I first started this, my biggest fear was that I wouldn't be able to do the subject justice. That I would start something, and entirely botch it in the process. And now, at the end, I can only hope that I didn't. I started this wanting to do the same thing that the comic did, just in a different medium. Thank you for reading, for your support and your criticism.</p>\n<p>Marvel released a special edition of comics called Spider-Man and the Power Pack, where the heroes battled real-life problems in order to gain awareness with their young audience. In the very first issue, Spider-Man saves a young boy named Tony Lewis from his babysitter, Judy, who he overhears attempting to sexually assault her charge. He swings into action, scares away Judy, and convinces Tony to talk to his parents after sharing how he was assaulted by his older friend, Skip. When I read this, I immediately was shocked. Seriously, I had never heard about that aspect of Spider-Man's backstory before; it had always been just about Uncle Ben. Then, that plot-bunnies attacked and this resulted. Seriously, this adds all new dimensions to his character; I had to explore it. Much of the flashbacks is from the actual comic, and some of the dialogue comes directly from the text. I have changed a few aspects of the plot for the purposes of the story, but much of it is in its original form.</p>\n<p>If you are ever in a situation where you are being taken advantage of, please ask for help. There are people who can and will do everything in their power to help you.</p>",
    "text": "When Spider-Man fought, he was always cautious about his strength. He could break someone\u2019s bones just by poking them too hard; he could dent steel with a flick of his wrist. Killing someone would be easy, if he wasn\u2019t careful.\n\u00a0\nSpider-Man was always careful.\n\u00a0\nHe wasn\u2019t like Daredevil, who beats the ever-loving-shit out of the criminals he catches (there was a reason why the criminals of Hell\u2019s Kitchen were too scared to say his name, and why the first thing anyone in trouble in that city did was scream for the Devil to save them); he couldn\u2019t be, with his strength. It was too dangerous, too risky. Spider-Man was more of the humiliate them, incapacitate them, and web them brand. Granted, he did get in physical confrontations past simply webbing them, but he was always -  always - careful to only use the barest fraction of his strength.\n\u00a0\nHe always hit the attempted rapists the hardest, though.\n\u00a0\nWhere a simple mugger would have gotten harsh bruises and sprained muscles, rapists got fractured ribs and broken bones. He didn\u2019t mean to hit them the hardest  per se - Peter had never gone out with the explicit intention of hurting them the most - but his strength always seemed to be more difficult to control around them.\n\u00a0\nIt didn\u2019t mean anything, though.\n\u00a0\n Anybody  would punch those types of criminals the hardest, Peter justified. There was an entire YouTube channel dedicated to Daredevil\u2019s exploits, for instance, and when they graphed out the injuries of his opponents - literally  graphed  them out, on a chart and everything, as if it was for  school  - the human traffickers and the sexual predators always had the highest injury count. Jessica Jones had  snapped the neck of her rapist. It was a human, visceral reaction to act harshest towards those types of violations.\n\u00a0\nIt didn\u2019t mean anything.\n\u00a0\nIt didn\u2019t mean anything  to him. \n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t personal.\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nWhen Peter was seven, Skip became his babysitter.\n\u00a0\nSteven Westcott - Skip - was a much older, much cooler boy that lived a few streets down from Peter, and he was the only kid in a fifteen mile radius that didn\u2019t avoid strange little Peter Parker for the sole reason that the seven year old could solve equations that gave college professors trouble.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAren\u2019t you that kid whose nose is always buried in a textbook?\u201d he had greeted. \u201cName\u2019s Steven Westcott; call me Skip.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter had glanced over the rim of his glasses to see a taller, older boy staring down at him with a cocky grin and quirk to his eyebrows. The seven year old had anticipated a short, empty conversation that ended the moment Peter said something that sounded a bit  off coming from someone without a PhD, or a less short, painful confrontation that ended with a bloody nose and another pair of broken glasses.\n\u00a0\nHe hadn\u2019t expected the older boy to actually try to  befriend him.\n\u00a0\nHe definitely hadn\u2019t expected him to succeed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhich way do you live? I never walked Einstein home before.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, Skip.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI  want to. Einstein, this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd, strangely enough, it had been. Peter honestly couldn\u2019t understand why Skip hung around him; most children wouldn\u2019t be caught dead hanging out with someone so much younger than them, let alone one that was so weird that kids his own age hated him. He never asked why Skip kept coming around; he was too afraid of doing anything that could end the friendship just as it began.\n\u00a0\nSkip had been Peter\u2019s first, best, and only friend.\n\u00a0\nThree weeks after he met Skip, May and Ben made him his babysitter.\n\u00a0\nThey had been hesitant, at first. May and Ben had been so young when they received the orphaned Peter, newlyweds, really, and hadn\u2019t been ready for a child, let alone the pint-sized genius they were aunt and uncle to. While Peter knew they loved him, they were stumbling through parenthood, and had overanalyzed every little decision - and regretted every decision they hadn\u2019t, like when they impulsively told Peter to call them May and Ben instead of Aunt May and Uncle Ben. The idea of leaving their nephew with an older boy they didn\u2019t know very well had grated on them, friend or no, and it had eventually been necessity that had persuaded them to accept Skip\u2019s offer of free babysitting.\n\u00a0\n(\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun,\u201d Skip had informed Peter with a wink. \u201cNot really babysitting at all, just the two of us, hanging out.\u201d)\n\u00a0\nMay and Ben had dropped Peter off at Skip\u2019s house before leaving for their weekend shifts, hovering uncertainly before departing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. and Mrs. Parker, \u201c Skip had beamed, ruffling Peter\u2019s hair. \u201cI\u2019ll take good care of him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter ran into Captain America while he was patrolling Brooklyn.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCaptain,\u201d he greeted awkwardly. \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, yeah. Been back for a few days now; I understand I have you and your friends to thank for that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter shrugged noncommittally. \u201cThe Accords were crashing and burning on their own pretty well. We just sped up the process a bit. It was all just a coincidence, really.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Accords  had  crashed and burned, in a massive, fiery kind of way that would have been almost funny, if it didn't take so many innocents down with it.\n\u00a0\nMassive amounts of bureaucracy was never conducive to fast response times, and when aliens were falling from the sky, or mad scientists were making their bid for world domination, or Nazi organizations that resurrected phoenix style were trying to kill half of the planet\u2019s population, sooner was always better than later. The world became painfully aware of this fact when disaster after disaster occurred with no Avenger in sight. Countries began to pull out of the Accords one by one, starting with Wakanda and continuing from there.\n\u00a0\nFirst, it had been some deranged mad scientist with some kind of laser tech in Minsk. The Avengers had stopped him before with very little trouble (he just kept escaping, resulting in them having to catch him again), but this time, the Oversight Committee in charge of deploying the remaining Avengers had decided their help wasn\u2019t needed.\n\u00a0\nIn the past three attempts the villain had made, only one person had died, and that was before the Avengers even showed up.\n\u00a0\nThis time, seventeen people died.\n\u00a0\nBelarus, Poland, the Ukraine, and Germany left the Accords less than a week later.\n\u00a0\nNext, it was some lunatic lobbing grenades and an unknown, highly destructive concussive device around London. The local authorities couldn\u2019t stop him due to the near-indestructible armor he was wearing. They requested the help of Iron Man and the Vision, and thus, the debates began. The Oversight Committee was  still debating when the crisis was eventually stopped - after forty-seven deaths and countless injuries - when an everyday citizen revealed themselves to be powered and took down the madman with very little trouble. Instead of being thankful that lives were saved, the Committee tried to imprison the hero without a trial because she had never signed the Accords and didn\u2019t wait until they gave the okay for superhuman intervention. England closed ranks around their new favorite hero, left the Accords, and basically gave the middle finger to anyone who tried to prosecute her.\n\u00a0\nAnd it so continued, one by one, until the only big holdout left was America.\n\u00a0\nHonestly, Peter was surprised it had taken so long. When Captain America was more welcome anywhere  but America, you know something\u2019s gonna snap. He just hadn\u2019t expected it to snap with him in the center of it.\n\u00a0\nHydra attacked Times Square less than six months after Captain America and Co. had become fugitives. Despite being only two blocks away, Stark was unable to intervene, stuck in his tower because the Oversight Committee was withholding his suits from him until they made a decision regarding intervention, all while Hydra rampaged through the city.\n\u00a0\nSpider-Man suited up, swung by Hell\u2019s Kitchen to pick up Daredevil - marking the first time the man had ever fought outside of Hell\u2019s Kitchen - and arrived in time to stop an armored Jeep Wrangler from crashing into a crowd at sixty miles per hour. He then proceeded to rip the door to the car off its hinges, yank out the Hydra agents - who Daredevil proceeded to beat the daylights out of - and throw said Jeep into the gun turret they had set up on the other end of Times Square.\n\u00a0\nIt really went downhill from there. For Hydra.\n\u00a0\nJessica Jones and Luke Cage pulled up in a taxi - a freaking  taxi - halfway through the fight, and pretty much sealed the coffin on the already dwindling Hydra forces. Unlike Daredevil and Spider-Man, however, neither of them wore a mask. Apparently, any attempt at a secret identity for Jones had already been shot to Hell, due to the small fact that she had a tendency to casually crumple steel with her bare hands as an intimidation technique, and since she ran around throwing goons through walls and claiming to have laser eyes (she didn\u2019t, Peter asked) whenever she delivered court summons for Hogarth. On top of all that, everyone and their cousin knew who she was after the Kilgrave debacle. Cage had an equally unlikely chance of ever maintaining a secret identity, since he had walked out of exploding buildings and bar fights alike without a scratch.\n\u00a0\nBy the end of the battle, four exhausted superhumans were still standing, dozens of Hydra forces were on the ground, and a helicopter with mounted Chitauri weapons was dangling between buildings, caught in a web of Peter\u2019s creation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou have three fractured ribs,\u201d Matt informed him. \u201cThere\u2019s also a few minor lacerations, major bruising, and a torn ligament.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t looking too hot yourself,\u201d Peter shot back. It was true. The man had a cut cheek, bruises scattered across his visible skin, a split lip, and a limp.\n\u00a0\nDaredevil grinned, blood leaking across his teeth in a way that made Peter understand why there were criminals convinced he was Satan incarnate. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, hardy har har. You\u2019re so very funny. You know, those jokes only make sense when people know who you are; other people have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so funny.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter reached out to shove the man, then groaned at the movement. \u201cThat sucked. That sucked so hard. Can I borrow concealer or something from Karen? My aunt\u2019s gonna wonder why I got hurt, and then she\u2019s gonna wonder why the bruises disappeared overnight.\u201d Peter had had enough trouble trying to explain why his war wounds from Steve from Brooklyn had healed during the half-hour he had an icepack on them; he didn\u2019t need anymore trouble.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, tell me more about the troubles of accelerated healing,\u201d Daredevil intoned dryly. \u201cThe cross you bear must be so heavy. I\u2019ll just go home and count myself lucky that I\u2019ll have to spend the next few weeks claiming I fell down the stairs.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMan, you don\u2019t need an advanced healing factor; you\u2019ve got Catholicism. Pain just kind of rolls off you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Devil of Hell\u2019s Kitchen is  Catholic?\u201d Jones interrupted. Peter turned around. The pair had crossed the Square while they had been talking, coming up behind them.\n\u00a0\nMatt cocked his head. \u201cAnd if he is?\u201d\n\u00a0\nJones shrugged. \u201cNothing. Just thought Catholics had something against dressing up in bright red fetish gear before hanging around in dark alleys.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter snorted a laugh. \u201cI like you,\u201d he declared. \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d he introduced, before pointing at Matt. \u201cDaredevil.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe know who you are,\u201d Cage said. He cast a surveying glance around the destroyed area. \u201cWhat a mess.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCoulda used Stark or some shit,\u201d Jones agreed. \u201cPizza?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure,\u201d Peter shrugged. Behind them, the helicopter creaked and groaned ominously. \u201cI... should probably get that down now; those webs dissolve after an hour, and I don\u2019t want falling on someone.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey ended up on the floor of Jones apartment, eight large pizza boxes set between them as they watched the news role in.\n\u00a0\nBy the time the Council approved the use of Iron Man and Vision, six out of the eight pizzas were gone, Spider-Man had beaten both Jones and Cage in an arm wrestling contest, and Daredevil had beaten all of them at darts. (That in itself wasn\u2019t very impressive to the other two, but Peter knew Matt was blind, just like he knew that the man was listening to the air currents or something to figure out the best way to hit the bullseye.) By the time the Council found out that the crisis had been resolved by four non-signed individuals, all the pizza was gone, and Jones had broken out her booze stash.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Daredevil declared, not even looking up at the proffered bottle. \u201cIf you so much as look at an alcohol bottle, Webhead, I\u2019m dragging you out of here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s highly unlikely I can even get drunk.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t care. Until you\u2019re twenty-one, you\u2019re sticking to water.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJones looked at them incredulously. \u201cHe\u2019s not twenty-one yet?\u201d\n\u00a0\nCage looked slightly disturbed. \u201cYou\u2019re over eighteen though?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI plead the fifth,\u201d Peter grumbled.\n\u00a0\nThe bottle clunked on the floor. Jones spun on Daredevil. \u201cWhy the Hell are you letting him go out?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t let me do  anything,\u201d Peter protested. \u201cWhen we first met, he tried to duct tape me to a fire escape to keep me from fighting. He hadn\u2019t figured out I had super strength yet.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really keep Spider-Man from doing anything,\u201d Daredevil agreed reluctantly. \u201cHe\u2019s too stubborn for that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBy the time the Oversight Committee had issued warrants for their arrest, Jessica and Luke had mostly gotten over Peter\u2019s age, and Matt and Peter were about to leave.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have to figure out who we are before they can get close,\u201d Matt pointed out, \u201cbut you two don\u2019t have the same luxury. You were caught on camera fighting; they\u2019ll find out where you live. You may want to get lawyers.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve got one,\u201d Jones replied. \u201cReal shark, too. She\u2019ll run circles around them.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhat followed was, quite frankly, a train wreck.\n\u00a0\nThe NYPD refused to go after them. The police force - the people who had been shooting at them since day dot - would not fulfill the warrants for  any of them, and even dropped the warrants they already had for Spider-Man and Daredevil.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy should we arrest them for saving our asses?\u201d one officer scoffed, on live TV. \u201cIt\u2019s more than the \u2018official\u2019 forces did.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFrustrated, the Joint Counter Terrorist Center sent out their own forces, who were easily dodged by Matt and Peter, and buried in legal precedents by Jessica\u2019s attorney, Hogarth, who, according to Matt, could smell the blood in the water better than an  actual  shark.  Then, the videos of the fight hit YouTube, where one could find clear images of Daredevil single-handedly fighting off six men trying to attack a group of kids of a field trip, Jones throwing Hydra goons into one another, Cage shielding bystanders with his body, and Spider-Man physically catching a crashing bus before it could ram into a building. That resulted in protests from the New Yorkers, who were immediately offended that someone was being arrested for saving their lives. The Accords began to teeter in their last stronghold, and, as a last ditch effort, the Oversight Committee ordered Iron Man to bring in Daredevil and Spider-Man (they were still wading their way through red tape when it came to Jones and Cage).\n\u00a0\nTony complied, then texted his completely normal grant receiver Peter Parker what neighborhoods he would be searching before taking off, merrily blasting ACDC as he went.\n\u00a0\nSay what you will about politicians, but they always know which way the wind was blowing. The second there was higher approval ratings for a mouthy kid in brightly colored spandex, a couple of alcoholics who literally stopped mid-fight to take a swig from a flask, and a man that half of the criminal underworld is convinced to be the Devil himself than for the heroes they championed, they changed their tune. Congress pulled out of the Accords in record time, as soon as the public pressure grew to the point it threatened their reelections.\n\u00a0\nThe warrants out for Spider-Man, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Captain America, and the rest of the rogue Avengers were cancelled. Rumor had it that Captain America was returning to New York, but nothing had been substantiated. Peter had pushed the issue to the back of his mind, seeing as he had never expected to see the man again.\n\u00a0\nAnd now, of course, he had no idea what to say to him. Sorry for stealing your shield and webbing your hands? I didn\u2019t realize how stupid the Accords were when I helped Stark, I just didn\u2019t want him to tell my aunt on me? Totally not sorry for taking down your huge friend, that was  awesome? Please don\u2019t smack me in the face with your patriotic frisbee of justice?\n\u00a0\nIn the end, the Captain spoke first. \u201cWhat brings you to Brooklyn? I thought you were a Queens boy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am. I try to take care of all parts of New York, except its  huge. I don\u2019t have to worry about Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Daredevil\u2019s got it handled, but other parts don\u2019t have their own vigilante. Mostly, I hang around Queens and Midtown, but I swing by Brooklyn, Manhattan, and a few other places whenever I can. Crime\u2019s pretty bad around here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHopefully not for much longer,\u201d Captain America replied. \u201cI was planning on keeping an eye on the place.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s eyebrows shot up from behind his mask. \u201cSeriously? I guess I\u2019ll head to the Bronx for a while, check out things around there. Oh, but make sure to check on Vinegar Hill, there have been some guys causing trouble the past few days, and they may be back. And there\u2019s a group out in Fort Greene who keeps stealing cars, they seem to be dragging them back to a shop somewhere but I haven\u2019t been able to find it yet. Also, a few gangs in Downtown have been acting up, but if you go after any of them, make sure they don\u2019t find out where you live, because they\u2019ll burn your house down. And -\u201d Peter paused. The Captain was looking at him a tad bewildered, and a bit overwhelmed. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been a vigilante before, have you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoes everything that went down from Lagos to Siberia count?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen no.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Peter breathed. \u201cYou\u2019re more prepared than any of us were when we started out, so you shouldn\u2019t have much trouble getting the hang of things. You\u2019ll probably have your fair share of mishaps though, so be careful. Don\u2019t piss off the police, or they\u2019ll put warrants out for your arrest and shoot at you. When Daredevil started out, he got thrown into a lot of dumpsters - and I mean a  lot - so if you want tips on how to avoid that, talk to him; they\u2019re more helpful than you think. But for the love of all that is good and sweet, don\u2019t drag trouble after you into Hell\u2019s Kitchen unless you want to get the crud beaten out of you. Some of the us vigilantes meet every Thursday to spar; you\u2019re welcome to come if you want. We keep burner phones in case we need backup; you might want to consider investing in one.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve all really thought this out, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTrial and error, mostly. I - I heard that they\u2019re still considering prosecuting Sergeant Barnes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut it looks like it\u2019s heading that way.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not about to use Mr. Stark\u2019s lawyers.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCaptain Rogers looked down. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. It wouldn\u2019t be right to ask him that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nQuickly, Peter reached down and pulled a worn business card from his boot. \u201cHere. They\u2019re good attorneys, someone to at least consider. They only represent the innocent in their cases, and they do a lot of pro bono work.\u201d Peter paused. \u201cCan you pay them? Because they\u2019ll probably take your case either way, but innocent isn\u2019t always synonymous with financially secure, and they get paid in bananas a lot.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRogers chuckled. \u201cI can pay them. Nelson and Murdock,\u201d he read. \u201cI\u2019ll check them out. Uh\u2026 You carry their business card in your boot?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Yes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSirens began blaring through the air, and if Peter concentrated, he could just make out the red glare of the lights. \u201cDuty calls.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSpider-Man?\u201d the Captain called after him. \u201cThanks. For looking out for this place, that is.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter paused. \u201cHave you spoken to Mr. Stark since you got back?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe looked down. \u201cNot yet. My shield was already in my apartment when I got back, but that\u2019s the closest thing we\u2019ve had to a communication. I didn\u2019t want to push him if he didn\u2019t want to see me.\u201d \n\u201cMaybe\u2026 maybe you should consider it. I may not know what went down between the two of you, but I know that it can\u2019t all be because of the Accords.\u201d More sirens joined those already blaring. \u201cI should go. Good luck, Captain.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome on, Einstein. I want to show you something.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter followed, curious. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSkip led him to his room, letting Peter sit on his bed while he rooted through his closet. Eventually, he let out a cry of victory and pulled out a magazine from the top shelf before offering it to Peter. \u201cBet you\u2019ve never seen pictures like those in a stuffy textbook.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, no\u2026\u201d Peter admitted. Frankly, he had never seen pictures like that  anywhere. They looked like something May would ground him for knowing of their existence, let alone looking at them. Feeling uncomfortable, he shoved the magazine away.\n\u00a0\nPeter hadn\u2019t noticed Skip sitting down next to him; the older boy was suddenly there, a bit too close for comfort.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you say we conduct a little experiment of our own, Einstein?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSkip put his hand on Peter\u2019s tigh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s see if we can touch each other like the people in that magazine.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Skip,\u201d Peter stuttered. \u201cI - I have to go,\u201d he scrambled. Then, he paused. Where would he go? His aunt and uncle wouldn\u2019t be home for hours.\n\u00a0\nThe call came while Spider-Man was swinging between buildings. Quickly, he flipped to a stop, landing on the rooftop to an apartment building.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello?\u201d he answered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter Benjamin Parker,\u201d Foggy Nelson hissed. \u201cDid you give Steve Rogers our business card?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBased on your tone, that question is rhetorical.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCaptain  freaking  America just asked Nelson and Murdock to represent James Buchanan Barnes, Peter!  And  he says he heard about us from  Spider-Man.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cYou sound mad,\u201d Peter observed. \u201cDoes this mean you\u2019re not taking the case?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re taking the case,\u201d Foggy said. \u201cBut a little warning that Truth, Justice, and the American Way was about to walk in our doors would have been nice.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter paused. He hadn\u2019t considered that. \u201cOh. Yeah, I suppose so. Sorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy sighed. \u201cI\u2019m a flexible person; I feel I\u2019ve learned how to handle the weird pretty well these past few months. My blind best friend turns out to be a ninja vigilante with freaky heightened senses? Sure! He drags back another vigilante with a similar coloring scheme one day to mentor, as if Spider-Man\u2019s some kind of little lost puppy? Why not? But right now there\u2019s a superpowered World War II vet sitting in my waiting room, and damn it, I have earned the right to a heads up!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am  not  some kind of lost puppy - wait Rogers is there  right now?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Foggy replied. \u201cMatt\u2019s not in yet, and Captain Rogers didn\u2019t want to have to repeat everything twice, so Karen\u2019s waiting with him while I ducked in my office to make a few phone calls.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFoggy!\u201d Peter hissed. \u201cI\u2019ve been to your offices; the waiting room is literally right outside of your office!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCaptain Rogers has heightened senses; Stark warned me about them before Germany! They\u2019re not close to Matt\u2019s level, but they\u2019re still jacked up! He\u2019s probably heard every single word of this conversation!\u201d\n\u00a0\n \u201cWhat? Oh God, oh God, I\u2019ve mentioned Matt in this conversation! I\u2019ve mentioned Matt as Daredevil in this conversation!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTechnically, you never pointed out that he was specifically Daredevil until right now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy swore. \u201cHeightened senses were not on his Wikipedia page!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCalm down,\u201d Peter soothed. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that he heard anything.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy groaned. \u201cNo, he definitely heard everything. His face has gone really red and he keeps glancing over at the office.\u201d Foggy groaned again. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s even redder, and he\u2019s flat out staring at the office. And he just waved. And now Matt\u2019s walking in. I am screwed. I am so screwed. I blame you for this, Parker.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve mentioned  my  name in this conversation too, along with the fact that I\u2019m Spider-Man. This is  not my fault!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAcross the line, Peter could hear the sound of a door opening.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFoggy, why did Captain America just greet me as  Mr. Daredevil?\u201d \n\u00a0\nPeter wisely decided that this was the best time to hang up.\n\u00a0\nThe fact that his encounter with Rogers may or may not have led to the reveal of both his and Matt\u2019s secret identities was potentially bad, but not disastrous. Tony \u201cI am Iron Man\u201d Stark had figured out his identity months ago, and it was still safe; Rogers seemed to be cut from an even more secretive cloth. Even though the situation wasn\u2019t ideal, he probably wouldn\u2019t tell anybody.\n\u00a0\nEither way, freaking out about it wouldn\u2019t do anything.\n\u00a0\nSucking in a deep breath, Peter attempted to center himself. Whenever his emotions ran high, his senses went haywire. Matt had been teaching him how to handle his enhanced awareness, but he had nowhere near the effortless control of the man; he still needed time to get them in hand.\n\u00a0\nHe breathed in.\n\u00a0\nHe breathed out.\n\u00a0\nHe listened to the sounds of the city.\n\u00a0\nAnd he heard something.\n\u00a0\nThe hand inched higher.\n\u00a0\nBy the time Peter truly realized what was happening, he was too scared to run.\n\u00a0\nEverything had spiralled out of control so quickly.\n\u00a0\nOne second, Peter had been sitting on the roof of the apartment building, the next a noise from the structure itself had him spinning into motion without a thought, and suddenly, a window was in pieces and Peter was standing in somebody\u2019s living room.\n\u00a0\nAnd Peter found that none of that mattered, because there was a trembling boy named Tony in front of him, no more than ten years old, and he was pinned to the ground by an older woman, his belt already unbuckled and his pants halfway down his legs.\n\u00a0\nThe woman jumped away as if she had been burnt. \u201cWhat the Hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she snapped.\n\u00a0\nPeter had heard her speak from the roof, had heard every word of the horrific, disgusting conversation that had just occurred. He had heard Tony\u2019s laughter as she played with him, heard his innocent request to watch Star Wars together. He had heard promise that they could if he just did one little thing for her: if he just took off all his clothes.\n\u00a0\nHe had heard naive laughter morph into confused stammers as harmless tickles turned into disturbing touches.\n\u00a0\nSuddenly, Peter wanted to snap back at her. He wanted to shoot webs over her mouth so she could never make such a disgusting request again, wanted to treat this as if were just another back alley crime.\n\u00a0\nExcept this wasn\u2019t some random rapist in the dead of night; this wasn\u2019t just another back alley crime. This was Tony\u2019s mom, or aunt, or cousin, or neighbor, or  babysitter, and it was suddenly so close to memories better left forgotten that Peter couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\u00a0\nWhat he wanted more than anything, he realized, was to get Tony away from this ugly scene that could only cause pain.\n\u00a0\nAnd so he turned away from the woman, and back towards the boy. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he began.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to him! This is trespassing, get out!\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter ignored her. He focused on Tony, who was glancing between Spider-Man and his attacker with undisguised fear. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony, go to your room!\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter wanted him to understand, to understand better than little, seven-year-old Peter ever had. \u201cYou can  leave.  You don\u2019t have to stay with her. You can  go.\u201d \n\u00a0\nTony made a decision.\n\u00a0\nHe scrambled to his feet and hiked up his pants, cheeks burning red with shame. Then, he ran to Spider-Man, casting a wary glance at the panicking woman. \u201cI - I want to go.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t think twice.\n\u00a0\nThey were back out the window and over the city in moments, thin arms wrapped around Peter\u2019s neck as he swung through the air. Peter set the two of them down on a rooftop a block away. The minute his feet touched the ground, Tony scrambled away, stumbling to a stop and falling to the ground.\n\u00a0\nHe started to cry.\n\u00a0\nAwkwardly, Peter hovered next to him, silently freaking out. He was  terrible  at comforting people, and he didn\u2019t even have the foggiest clue as to how to make this better. He was standing on the rooftop with a crying little kid who had just been assaulted, and Peter still needed to talk to him and find out just how long it had been going on and how far it had gone and a million others things, but he had no idea how to  do any of that.\n\u00a0\nOh, and it was possible that he had technically kidnapped this kid. Couldn\u2019t forget that part.\n\u00a0\nPeter carefully raised his hand to touch the boy\u2019s shoulder in a hopefully comforting way, but dropped it again instead. Shifting awkwardly, Spider-Man crouched down next to the crying child, flinching internally when the boy sobbed harder and shrank in on himself.\n\u00a0\nEventually, the tears dwindled. Tony began to abruptly tear at his skin in a frantic manner, red scratches appearing along his arms.\n\u00a0\nPeter gently placed a gloved hand over the boy\u2019s. \u201cStop,\u201d he warned softly.\n\u00a0\nTony shook his head. \u201cI feel dirty.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know, Tony, but you can\u2019t -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cKnow?\u201d the boy snapped, tears forming in his eyes again. \u201cHow could you know? You\u2019re a superhero! You\u2019re  Spider-Man!\u201d he stated with a watery hysteria. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand!\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter swallowed.\n\u00a0\nHe could speak in hypotheticals, could tell Tony about a \u201cfriend\u201d he once knew. He could walk away without ever voicing a terrible truth aloud.\n\u00a0\nHe couldn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI do understand,\u201d Peter answered slowly. \u201cI - I understand perfectly.\u201d\n\u00a0\nComprehension dawned in Tony\u2019s eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut - but you\u2019re a superhero,\u201d he stuttered slowly. \u201cYou have powers.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t always. I used to be just a scrawny little kid, too scared to run, too embarrassed to ask for help.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony watched him through red-rimmed eyes. \u201cYou - you were scared?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBeneath the mask, Peter smiled humorlessly. \u201cTerrified,\u201d he answered honestly. \u201cMore terrified than I had ever been in my entire life.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you ever tell?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEventually,\u201d Peter nodded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Tony glanced up, looking simultaneously hopeful and scared for the answer. \u201cIf you were embarrassed, why did you tell people?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause I was even more scared that if I didn\u2019t, it would never stop.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBy the time May and Ben returned, Peter\u2019s clothes were back on.\n\u00a0\nHis belt was buckled.\n\u00a0\nHis pants weren\u2019t even rumpled.\n\u00a0\n(Skip had made sure to finish with him long before his aunt and uncle came back.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you boys have fun?\u201d Ben questioned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe had a great time!\u201d Skip beamed, innocent, charismatic grin in place.\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t answer.\n\u00a0\n(But he also didn\u2019t tell.)\n\u00a0\nTony\u2019s parents worked as lawyers at Hogarth, Chao, and Benowitz.\n\u00a0\nBecause of course.\n\u00a0\nPeter had to give this to the law firm: soulless sharks or not, they knew how to hire some impressive help.\n\u00a0\nThe receptionist was giving Peter a look that was part bored, part pure, unadulterated steel, as if it was completely normal to have  Spider-Man standing in your waiting room, clutching the hand of a young boy. Then again, this was the firm that Jones worked with, so it probably wasn't the strangest thing she had ever seen. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Lewis are in a meeting at the moment,\u201d she said, barely glancing up. \u201cThey're not to be disturbed.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIf they wanted to play hard ball, that was fine by Peter; he could be just as stubborn as them. \u2018Disturb them\u2019 had almost left his lips when Tony interrupted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe can wait,\u201d he hurriedly said, dragging Peter back to the waiting area. Reluctantly, he followed.\n\u00a0\nIt had been a long, painful talk with Tony on that rooftop. While Peter didn't force him to say anything he was uncomfortable with, he did find out the important things, namely that it was the first time his babysitter, Judy, had ever tried anything, she had only just begun to touch him when Spider-Man showed up, and he really, really didn't want to tell his parents.\n\u00a0\nThat last part held a bit more difficulty than the others.\n\u00a0\nIt had taken over three hours of hesitant conversation, soft arguments, and a thousand repetitions of  \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault\u201d in order to convince Tony that his parents wouldn\u2019t be upset with him.\n\u00a0\nThey would be upset with Judy, granted, but not with him.\n\u00a0\nWhen Tony finally seemed to come to terms with the fact that it  wasn\u2019t his fault (something Peter had struggled with much longer than him), Spider-Man web-slung the two of them over to his parents\u2019 work; this wasn\u2019t the type of thing you sat on.\n\u00a0\nTony was clutching Peter\u2019s arm with a strength that would have been impressive if he wasn\u2019t, you know, Spider-Man. Peter glanced down at him with concern. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony swallowed. Hard. \u201cYeah,\u201d he stuttered. \u201cJust fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOkay, stupid question, Parker.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow did your parents take it?\u201d Tony asked suddenly, his voice hushed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t upset with me, Tony,\u201d Peter promised. \u201cAnd yours won\u2019t be either.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know that,\u201d he rushed to respond, though he didn\u2019t sound all that convinced. \u201cBut how did they, you know,  react?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d Peter said thoughtfully, thinking back to that day he had finally  said something, \u201cthey did cry. And then my au - mom tried to take a tire iron to my babysitter's head.\u201d She didn\u2019t make it out the front door or anything, thank God - the last thing they had needed was assault with a weapon charges. When May had rooted up the heavy metal tire iron from the basement before walking towards the door with obvious intent, Ben had intervened, grabbing away the bludgeoning device and holding her. She had fought him briefly, still trying to get to the door, before bursting into tears.\n\u00a0\nNeither of them had realized that Peter was watching from the top of the stairs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd then they called the police,\u201d he finished.\n\u00a0\nTony looked worried.\n\u00a0\nFrankly, Peter wasn\u2019t really sure which part was worrying the kid more: the tire iron part or the police part. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe wasn\u2019t really sure how to reassure him either, in all honesty. The tire iron probably wouldn\u2019t happen for him, and the police definitely would, but there was no getting around that.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the Hell?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter snorted, not even bothering to turn around. \u201cEloquent as always, Miss Jones.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you doing here, Webs? Hogarth didn\u2019t manage to get her claws into you, did she?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m here for something else,\u201d Peter responded. Nodding at his companion, he said, \u201cJones, this is Tony. Tony, this is my friend Jessica.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d he piped up, giving a wane smile before glancing back down at the ground.\n\u00a0\nJessica shot him a questioning look; Peter shook his head in response.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony jumped to his feet. \u201cHi, Mom.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was a pretty, dark-skinned woman staring at the pair of them, her elegant features pulled back into an expression of sheer worry. A tall man dressed in a dark business suit was coming up behind her, and, based on his likeness to the boy, he was Tony\u2019s father.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you alright? Why aren\u2019t you with Judy?\u201d Her gaze fell to the brightly colored vigilante sitting next to her son. Awkwardly, Peter gave her a small wave. \u201cWhy are you here? Did something happen?\u201d she demanded, her sight locked on the vigilante, her eyebrows furrowed, and her gaze dissecting Peter\u2019s every move.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr. and Mrs. Lewis, hi,\u201d Peter responded. \u201cThere\u2019s - there\u2019s something Tony needs to talk to you about. In private.\u201d\n\u00a0\nConcern prickled at the corners of her eyes. \u201cWe can go to my office. Come on, Tony.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs she reached for her son, Tony dug in his heels and clenched Peter\u2019s hand tighter. \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t leave,\u201d he accused, staring at Spider-Man. \u201cYou said you\u2019d stay until I so it was okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I won\u2019t leave,\u201d Peter promised.\n\u00a0\nVisibly, the boy relaxed, and Peter suspected it was more due to the fact that he was someone who knew what he was going through rather than the fact that he was Spider-Man.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did you want to tell us?\u201d Mr. Lewis asked, his deep voice pinched with worry.\n\u00a0\nAnd, in short, painful sentences, Tony told him.\n\u00a0\nWhat happened next was much of what Peter remembered of when he told his aunt and uncle: horrified gasps, tears, and the completely and utterly devastated look of someone trying to figure out how the Hell this had happened.\n\u00a0\nWhen Peter finally left, they asked him what they could ever do to repay him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou - you already have,\u201d Peter answered with a slight, barely noticeable tremor in his voice. \u201cIt may not seem that way, but you\u2019ve done more than repay me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd then he was gone.\n\u00a0\nWhen Peter got home, he went upstairs, turned on the shower as hot as it could go, and scrubbed at his arms until they bled.\n\u00a0\nNo matter how hard he scrubbed, it never seemed to wash  Skip away from him.\n\u00a0\nBut with the burning water raining down on him, Peter could pretend the warm streaks flowing down his cheeks were from the shower.\n\u00a0\nPeter cried.\n\u00a0\nHe left Tony behind, found a tall, abandoned rooftop far enough from Hell\u2019s Kitchen that Daredevil could never hear him, and sank to the ground and cried.\n\u00a0\nPeter had always liked to shove his past to the back of his mind, pretend like what had happened had gone away the moment Skip finally left his life. But, deep down, it had been there every step of the way, dogging him from the shadows of his mind.\n\u00a0\nDeep down, there had always been a dark, ugly part of him whispering  itwasyourfaultyourfault   yourfault. \n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t until he met Tony, saw the parallels between the two of them, that he truly realized  he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. \n\u00a0\nHe wasn\u2019t responsible; he didn\u2019t need to feel ashamed or disgusted with himself anymore. It wasn\u2019t his fault.\n\u00a0\nIt really hadn\u2019t been his fault.\n\u00a0\nIt was as if a weight had been lifted from Peter\u2019s mind. For the first time since Skip had touched him, Peter felt whole again. It was finally over.\n\u00a0\nThe relief of it was enough to make him cry.\n\u00a0\nWhen he stopped, he felt different. Cleansed. As if a black film of disgust had finally been removed from his mind, freeing him.\n\u00a0\nPeter got up, changed out of his costume had went home, feeling lighter than he had in a long, long time.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter?\u201d May questioned, her worried gaze dropping from his red-rimmed eyes to his haggard appearance. Instantly, the overprotective lioness that had hovered just beneath the surface since the day he told her what had happened resurfaced. Granted, she didn\u2019t believe in helicoptering over every little thing he did, but she had also developed a keen radar for BS after Skip slipped under hers. She had never really forgiven herself for falling for his only-child, Peter-is-the-brother-I-never-had act, despite Peter\u2019s insistence that it wasn\u2019t her fault. Unfortunately, that same overprotective lioness was the reason he could never tell her about Spider-Man: Peter hadn\u2019t exaggerating when he told Mr. Stark she would  freak out.  \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she demanded. \u201cDid someone hurt you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter remembered the way she had cried when she found out what Skip had done to him, remembered the scorching fury in her voice and the  \u201cdamn straight we are pressing charges\u201d she had snapped out at the police officer who dared ask. Smiling, he hugged her, wishing for a moment that he didn\u2019t have super strength, because it made everyone else delicate porcelain he could so easily break, and he didn't want to risk that with May. \u201cI\u2019m okay, May,\u201d he promised, pulling back. \u201cI\u2019m really, really okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt would never happen again, Peter vowed.\n\u00a0\nWhat had happened with Skip had been a dirty, foreign thing that he - despite his high IQ and above average intelligence - didn\u2019t understand. Somehow, Peter doubted that he ever would. It felt like something that he could never make sense of because it  didn\u2019t make sense, and would never make sense. All that he knew was that it made him feel filthy and ashamed, and he never, ever wanted it to happen again.\n\u00a0\nAnd it wouldn\u2019t. He would avoid Skip; take away the cause, and the problem would disappear with it. Eventually, Peter told himself, he would forget. It would be nothing but a distant, foggy memory that  didn\u2019t affect him anymore.  It was  over. \n\u00a0\nIt didn\u2019t matter anymore.\n\u00a0\nIt didn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nIt didn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\n(It did.)\n\u00a0\nHe could be okay again, Peter vowed. He  would be okay again.\n\u00a0\n(Peter didn\u2019t really believe this, not yet.)\n\u00a0He wasn\u2019t okay.\n\u00a0\nHe  had  been okay, had been better than okay. Peter had been  free.  He was free of the disgust, free of the crawling feeling of someone\u2019s hands where they  weren\u2019t supposed to be, free of Skip.\n\u00a0\nIt should have gotten better from there.\n\u00a0\nBut instead, Peter had fallen asleep early that night, mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausted, and ended up sleeping through the night and straight through the morning as well, not waking until past noon.\n\u00a0\nWhen he woke up, Peter couldn\u2019t even bring himself to be mad at himself for missing out on patrol that night. He was still stuck in the languid, floating sense of freedom, too drunk on relief to imagine all the people he could have helped if he had patrolled rather than slept. He got up, poured himself a bowl of slightly stale cereal, and vowed to go out as soon as he finished eating. Absently, Peter trailed into the living room, noting that May hadn\u2019t picked up the newspaper before she left for her Saturday morning shift at the hospital; it may be old fashioned, but both Peter and May loved reading the fine print, and most mornings the paper could be found on their coffee table, defiantly displayed against everyone that said print was an outdated form of media.\n\u00a0\n(*cough* Stark *cough*)\n\u00a0\nPlopping solidly down on the sofa, Peter grabbed the remote and flipped on the TV at random, barely noting that it had landed on the news station before he noticed the headlines.\n\u00a0\nScrawled against the bottom of the screen in massive, unmistakable block letters, it read: Spider-Man\u2019s Tragic Story, Shocking Abuse Scandal Rattles New York.\n\u00a0\nThe bowl shattered in his hands.\n\u00a0\nPeter barely noticed the ceramic shards cutting into his fingers, didn\u2019t register the milk and knock-off brand Corn Flakes splashing all over the floor. Instead, he listened as the over-dressed newscaster spoke in a fake-devastated tone about how one of New York\u2019s favorite heroes had been raped as a child, an unmistakable gleam of excitement in her eyes at having such a scandalous story at her fingertips.\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s hands became clammy and his heart began to race. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen; he was supposed to get  better  from here;  no one was supposed to find out. \n\u00a0\n(They still did.)\n\u00a0\nPeter could barely hear that stupid, obnoxious reporter over the wave roaring in his ears; he didn\u2019t  want  to hear her. But his super-hearing obviously didn\u2019t get the message, as he managed to pick up her gleeful voice soliloquizing about how the Amazing Spider-Man had rescued a poor little victim of sexual abuse yesterday - whose name had not been revealed, thank God - and how an \u201cunnamed source\u201d had overheard the boy talking to his parents at the police station about how he wouldn\u2019t have told them what happened if it hadn\u2019t been for Spider-Man, who convinced him it would be okay after telling him how  his sexual abuse had stopped when he went to an adult.\n\u00a0\nOh.\n\u00a0\nOh.\n\u00a0\nPeter sucked in a shaky breath before sinking to his knees and starting to pick up the shards on the ground. He wasn\u2019t mad at Tony; he really wasn\u2019t; after all, he had straight up told the kid to be honest with his parents about everything. He just hadn\u2019t exactly expected one of those things to include what  he had told him.\n\u00a0\nPeople finding out, it didn\u2019t matter. It didn\u2019t affect what he did as Spider-Man, and it certainly didn\u2019t affect what he did as Peter Parker. He would just keep doing what he was doing, and people would forget about it in a few weeks. It didn\u2019t matter.\n\u00a0\nIt didn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nIt didn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\n(It did.)\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s jacket began to buzz. Startled, he cut his finger on a shard and, swearing, he jerked the burner phone from his pocket. When he saw the blinking display flash up at him, Peter swore again. Matt was calling him, and he had had apparently been doing it all morning, if the twelve missed calls were an indication. Peter had put it on vibrate the day before - he had been searching through a warehouse that was a suspected front for arms-dealing, and he hadn\u2019t wanted to alert anybody of his presence by something as ridiculous as his phone ringing - and had forgotten to turn it back to sound. Quickly, he punched the answer button, praying that Matt wasn\u2019t calling because he had been kidnapped or shot or was dying in a dark alley somewhere.\n\u00a0\n\u201c- don\u2019t know, Karen, he\u2019s not picking up, calm down and let me   listen-\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cMatt?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter! Are you okay? I\u2019ve been calling all morning; you haven\u2019t been picking.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was asleep,\u201d he explained numbly. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cKaren and Foggy were worried,\u201d Matt explained. The \u2018so was I\u2019 went unspoken. \u201cKaren was about to head to Queens and break down your door.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA smile tweaked at the edges of Peter\u2019s lips. \u201cI think that would be a little hard to explain to my aunt.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter... Have you seen the news?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter slumped backwards. Of course it would be about this. \u201cYeah,\u201d he answered, closing his eyes. \u201cYeah, I have.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA pause. Then, \u201cIs it true?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSilence.\n\u00a0\nPeter sighed. \u201cIf you keep clenching the phone that hard, you\u2019re going to break it, and then Foggy will give you the 'Matt Murdock, why must you do these things' look, and Karen will give you the 'we have no money, damnit Matt, this is why we can\u2019t have nice things' look, and you will be able to sense them somehow despite the fact that you\u2019re blind and sensing the disappointed looks of your coworkers is\u00a0not part of the other four senses, and then you\u2019ll be upset and go beat up the Bulgarian mafia or something, which is bad for both the Bulgarian mafia and you, because they\u2019ll be in the hospital and you should be in a hospital but you\u2019ll be too Catholic to go, and then poor Claire will be called and she\u2019ll give you the 'I\u2019m a nurse not a miracle worker, Murdock' look before she calls Foggy and Karen, and then there will be all new looks and you\u2019ll go out and beat up even more people. Don\u2019t break the phone, Matt. It\u2019ll cause a vicious cycle.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a point of personal pride that, despite everything that was going on, that sentence managed to pull a bewildered \u201cWhat?\u201d from Matt\u2019s lips.\n\u00a0\n\u201cVicious. Cycle.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not clenching my phone, Peter,\u201d Matt, the lying liar who lies, lied.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou totally are. Whenever you are pissed, but there\u2019s no one around you can punch, you clench whatever you\u2019re holding really tight and it breaks. Always. I\u2019ve seen you break a cane handle like that, which is really impressive seeing as those canes have survived you chucking them in every alley under the sun.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA tired sigh. \u201cDon\u2019t change the subject, Peter.\u201d\n\u00a0\nQuickly, Peter\u2019s heart picked up, beating to the tune of  he\u2019snotsupposedtoknownoone\u2019ssupposedtoknowhecan\u2019tknowhecan\u2019tknowhecan\u2019tknow. \u201cSubject?\u201d he evaded. \u201cWhat subject? Pretty sure I\u2019m on subject. We were talking about your phone, and how you\u2019re totally going to break another one of them - which, come one, happens a lot, you really didn\u2019t need to throw that last one at that guy\u2019s head, it didn\u2019t even hit him that hard - which segues nicely into how you do that with everything, an excellent example of which is that perfectly good cane you broke last week. So, really, I\u2019m not changing any subject,\u201d he rambled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Matt started again. \u201cAre - are you okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhich, for Matt \u201cOf course I\u2019m okay, it\u2019s only a slight ninja sword on freaking  chains  wound\u201d Murdock, roughly translated to: You\u2019re totally hurt and we both know it, but we also will never admit it, so please,  please  don\u2019t do something stupid that will end with you getting mortally wounded, because God knows I will have to come running in after you like the overprotective mama bear that I am, and we do not need to fuel anymore rumors that Daredevil and Spider-Man are dating, you are fifteen and that is a freaking  felony. \n\u00a0\nInstantly, he deflated. \u201cI will be,\u201d he promised.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you want us to come over?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen he had first started vigilante-ing, the very idea of someone knowing his secret identity, let alone knowing where he lived, would have been enough to send him into a nervous breakdown. Of course, that was before he met Tony \u201cPrivacy? What is this privacy you speak of?\u201d Stark and Matt \u201cI can hear your heartbeat from ten miles away, and it\u2019s not creepy at all\u201d Murdock.\n\u00a0\nSecret identities kind of go to Hell around those two.\n\u00a0\nBriefly, he considered letting them come over. Matt had had his fair share of people defining him by only one aspect of himself, so it was highly unlikely he would treat Peter any different now that he knew. Karen would definitely be her usual badass self - really, Karen only had one setting, and that was badass - and bulldoze anything she deemed stupid, harmful to her loved ones, or stupid. Foggy would be, well, Foggy: He would march in ready to impose something he called \u201cself-preservation skills\u201d on the reckless, dumbass vigilantes he surrounded himself with, viciously mother everything in sight, and probably call someone a handsome duck. Because that was how Nelson and Murdock (and Page, damnit, I put up with way too much of your crap for way too little pay, I deserve my name on that door) rolled. It would be nice, he supposed, to hang out with them without it involving crime fighting and copious injuries.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNah,\u201d he dismissed. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt didn\u2019t ask if he was sure, which Peter was grateful for. Instead, he made him promise to call if he needed anything before passing the phone to Karen and Foggy, who somehow managed to talk about absolutely everything except what was on the news without making it sound like they were avoiding the elephant in the room, God bless them.\n\u00a0\nEventually, they hung up, leaving Peter sitting on the floor, little shards scattered around him as the news gleefully broadcasted about the worst thing that had ever happened to him.\n\u00a0\nHe had been such a fool to think it was over.\n\u00a0\nPeter stuttered to a stop at the foot of his staircase.\n\u00a0\nSkip was standing at the his front door, platnium blond hair neatly combed and that too-innocent, oh-God-how-did-I-not-see-how-fake-it-was smile on his lips.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Einstein,\u201d he grinned. \u201cCome on, your aunt and uncle asked me to babysit again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Peter realized that he had been a complete and utter  idiot to think it was over just because he wanted it to be.\n\u00a0\nAfter all, Skip hadn\u2019t stopped before just because Peter wanted him to. Why would he start now?\nJessica Jones was many things. Blunt, for one. She had the subtlety of a bulldozer and the strength to match it, and for her, that worked. She also wasn\u2019t one for dancing around a subject. When she wanted to tell you something, she did, and when she didn\u2019t, she didn\u2019t. There was no sugar coating, no easing someone into the information; she was just hard, fast, and efficient.\n\u00a0\nSo it spoke volumes about how bad the news situation was if she asked Peter to  please drop by her place, that it was important and probably shouldn\u2019t wait.\n\u00a0\nPeter hadn\u2019t wanted to go out. He hadn\u2019t wanted to do much of anything, honestly, but that urge probably did more harm than good. If he didn\u2019t do something, he would end up doing nothing but sit on that stupid floor all day - like he had been doing for the past four hours - broken shards and soggy cereal around him as he watched the news focus on his past for hours. And hours. And hours. \n\u00a0\nDeep down, Peter was grateful that Jones had called him; it gave him a reason to pull himself out of his fog. On the surface, however, he was much less gracious about the intrusion as he suited up, throwing on the iconic outfit with the temperament of an upset child preparing to visit a much hated relative.\n\u00a0\nBefore he left, Peter hesitated. Before, when people saw the suit, all they saw was the Amazing Spider-Man. A hero. Someone strong, unbreakable. Now, he would be the tragic little victim: someone to be pitied and tip-toed about. Peter had had enough of that treatment when the aftermath of Skip first occurred; he didn\u2019t need to deal with it again. Not as  Spider-Man. \n\u00a0\nPeter took a deep breath, braced himself, then threw himself out the window without a second thought.\n\u00a0\nThere were many things Peter loved about being Spider-Man. Helping people was an obvious one, along with the thrill of adrenaline in his veins.\n\u00a0\nOne of his favorite things, however, was that he got to fly.\n\u00a0\nWell,  swing, but in Peter\u2019s opinion, it was even better than flying. Stark flew. He could climb in an insulated metal container and jet off at supersonic speeds, all the while protected from the rush of wind and the weightless ecstasy by the Iron Man suit.\n\u00a0\nWeb slinging was so much better.\n\u00a0\nWhen Peter flew, he did it as  him. There was no suit other than thin spandex, nothing keeping him from the thrill of the sky. He whipped through the air at blurring speeds, hanging briefly at the climax before hurtling down, waiting until the last possible second to throw out a new line.\n\u00a0\nPeter flew, and he was free.\n\u00a0\n(Secretly, Peter thought that the rushing wind did a better job at wiping away the past than all the hot showers in the world had.\n\u00a0\nHe refused to repeat this thought aloud.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou ever think about using the front door, kid?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter slid the window shut behind him. \u201cI sincerely doubt that that constitutes as a door.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe \u201cdoor\u201d to Alias Investigations was in its usual state of constant disrepair. Jones must have had yet another unhappy customer, because the glass was broken, the door knob was bent at an unnatural angle, and there was a hole in the exact center that happened to be in the general shape of Jessica\u2019s fist.\n\u00a0\nThe owner of said fist shrugged. \u201cIt does the job.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoes it? Because that doesn't seem to be able to keep out much of anyone. You know, I can always fix it for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJones shrugged noncommittally. \u201cMaybe one day I'll take you up on that. Maybe not. Having Spider-Man fix your door for you is hardly inconspicuous. Besides, I kind of like the way it is; it gives me street cred.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter snorted. \u201cI think you've got plenty of that on your own.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSlowly, the good spirits brought on by the banter dwindled. \u201cYou, uh, said it was important.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJones nodded shortly before turning around and sliding back behind her desk. \u201cIt is. Kind of. I mean, I know I implied it was the \u2018time sensitive\u2019 brand of important, which it isn't really, but I figured it would be best to get you here anyway. It\u2026 It isn't good to be stuck in your head with everything that's going on. Doing something helps.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe would know, Peter realized with a growing sense of chagrin. Her past with her\u2026 attacker\u2026. was a lot worse than his. He had manipulated by his babysitter for a few weeks; she had been the plaything of a demented psychopath for months on end.\n\u00a0\nCompared with Jessica, his problems were nothing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat'd you have in mind?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI, uh, got a call from your Tony Lewis. This morning, when the\u2026 story\u2026. first broke. He remembered that you had introduced me as your friend, and was hoping that I had a way of getting in touch with you. He was scared you were mad at him for letting your\u2026 past\u2026 get out.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not mad,\u201d Peter promised. \u201cI\u2019ll - I\u2019ll go check on him later.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJessica nodded, looking down. \u201cDid you know he liked you even before you saved him? You were his hero. Now,\u201d she smirked tightly, \u201cnow you walk on water.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNeither of them spoke.\n\u00a0\nClearing her throat awkwardly, Jessica gave him a hesitant look. \u201cThey say that talking about it helps or something. That it\u2019s good for the healing process or whatever.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter gave her a short, humorless laugh. \u201cYeah, uh, I\u2019m not going to talk about it. I\u2019m - I\u2019m good. I can handle it on my own.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you ever see a shrink?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOnce.\u201d Peter winced at the memory. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go very well.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe had seen some psychiatrist that specialized in child trauma after the whole Skip debacle, but he had never gone back. Dr. Matthews had spent half the lesson pitying him - as if that would have helped  anyone  - and the other half of him pushing him to talk about it, as if that would have  changed what happened. She had been condescending to the extreme, acting as if Peter was some kind of mentally-disabled toddler that needed to be handled with kiddie-gloves, instead of the literal genius he was. By the end of the session, Peter had felt even more sick and frustrated than he had been when he walked in the door.\n\u00a0\nAfter that, Peter had begged his aunt and uncle not to send him back. And, so sick with guilt over Stick were they, they agreed without much argument.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI saw one a few times, after... what happened. Total waste of time, didn\u2019t get much out of it, but they did teach me this thing to help calm down when the memories got too much: Street names. Just list the names of the streets that you grew up on as a kid. It\u2026 It helps more than it sounds.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter swallowed past the knot in his throat. \u201cThanks, Jones. Maybe I\u2019ll try it sometime.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, well\u2026. Just start using the door, Webs. It\u2019s what normal people do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter laughed, and left by the window.\n\u00a0\nSkip never told Peter not to tell.\n\u00a0\nIt was implicit, granted, that what happened while he was babysitting was to remain between the two of them, but that was all. The words \u201cdon\u2019t tell\u201d never left his lips.\n\u00a0\nSometimes, Peter wished they had.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell\u201d meant that it was something shameful. It meant that the person had something to hide, something that could hurt them if it got out.\n\u00a0\nIt meant that there was a weapon to combat them with.\n\u00a0\nOn a level, Peter knew that Skip was exactly the kind of person that all those educational videos at school warned you about; he knew that Skip was the type of predator that people had preached about since preschool, the words  tell a trusted adult falling off teachers\u2019 lips like a mantra. He knew - on a level - that he should go to someone for help.\n\u00a0\nExcept.\n\u00a0\nSkip never told him not to tell.\n\u00a0\nHe never said the two words that all those infomercials had warned them about, those two words that were  always there in the hypothetical situations they laid out for them.\n\u00a0\nHe never showed just how weak he really was.\n\u00a0\nHe never handed Peter the very weapon with which to defeat him.\n\u00a0\nHe never said those two little words that signaled that what he was doing was completely, irrevocably  wrong. \n\u00a0\nAnd without those two words, Peter hesitated.\n\u00a0\nHe shouldn\u2019t need those words to know how to fight this; he shouldn't need Skip to spell it out for him. Peter was smart; deep down, he knew that those two words didn't change the result of their interactions.\n\u00a0\nBut what if Skip really didn't care if Peter told? What if Peter  did  tell, and no one cared? What if he laid out the entire embarrassing affair at the feet of people he loved, only for them to say,  no, you got it wrong, Peter; this isn't at all what we were warning you about; and we really don't care what's happening to you with Skip, so go run along with him now? \n\u00a0\nTwo little words could end this all.\n\u00a0\nSkip said a lot of words, most of which Peter  hated. He said soft cajolences and harsh insistences and subtle manipulations and annoyed insults that accompanied eyerolls. (He also said panted praises and sometimes gasped expletives and sometimes just Peter\u2019s name, but Peter only thought about those words when he woke up in the nights trembling, drenched with a cold sweat, the ghosts of hands that didn't belong to him in places they weren't meant to be.)\n\u00a0\nSkip said a lot of words.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon't tell\u201d were never some of them.\n\u00a0\nThis was not a mistake.\n\u00a0\nHere's the thing: Peter was a smart kid. He was  brilliant, in fact, and he had always been the most intelligent one in any relationship he had ever had.\n\u00a0\nBut that didn't mean that the other one in the relationship was stupid.\n\u00a0\nThat didn't meant that  Skip was stupid.\n\u00a0\nBecause he wasn't.\n\u00a0\nSometimes, when Peter looked into Skip\u2019s eyes (which was happening less and less, because whenever he did he saw what he once had mistaken to be friendship bubble up stronger, and when that happened, Peter  knew what was happening next), he saw crazed lust and selfish possession and something he couldn't recognize, but mostly, he saw cunning intelligence and sly planning.\n\u00a0\nSometimes, when Peter looked into Skip\u2019s eyes, he saw that Skip was so much smarter than the older boy had ever let on.\n\u00a0\nBecause he knew  exactly  what he was doing to Peter by never telling him not to tell.\n\u00a0\nThis time, Peter entered through the doors.\n\u00a0\nGranted, they were the glass balcony sliding doors on a tenth-floor apartment, but they were still doors.\n\u00a0\nPeter went straight to Tony\u2019s apartment after talking to Jessica; he didn\u2019t want to put it off, lest he chicken out. When he touched down softly on the terrace, Peter paused.\n\u00a0\nTony was sitting on the living room couch, his parents next to him. It was simple to hear his words; Peter had been able to \u00a0hear the apartment clearly from the  rooftop, let alone just outside the doors.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...if he hates me now?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSpider-Man doesn't hate you,\u201d Mr. Lewis soothed. \u00a0\u201cHe would never hate you for something you didn't do.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut now everyone knows about what happened to him! And he told me that in confidence! What if he never talks to me again?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter knocked.\n\u00a0\nThree heads swiveled in unison. When Tony saw who it was, he fell off the couch and scrambled to the sliding doors. \u201cSpider-Man!\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter smiled nervously beneath his mask. \u201cHey, Tony.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony\u2019s parents hovered awkwardly behind their child. Nobody moved. Spider-Man remained on the balcony. The family remained standing in their living room. A stray pigeon cooed at the group from its perch on a deck chair before flying off. All eyes followed the movement.\n\u00a0\nEventually, the tension broke. \u201cWould you like to come in?\u201d Mrs. Lewis offered maladroitly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, sure,\u201d Peter replied, stepping carefully into the apartment. He glanced around his surroundings. The living room was lavishly furnished, with a sleek yet comfortable design that spanked of wealth. At one look, he could tell that it was far, far above what the Parkers would ever be able to afford. Everything was perfectly designed, perfectly coordinated, and perfectly maintained.\n\u00a0\nExcept for the trash bag taped to the broken window. That kind of killed the ambience.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your window,\u201d Peter stated awkwardly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Mr. Lewis rushed to tell him. \u201cIt\u2019s just a window. We\u2019re just thankful you were there.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe uncomfortable silence descended once more.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you want to sit down?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, sure.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter became very interested in the pattern of his armchair. Across from him, seated on the couch, the Lewis\u2019s did the same.\n\u00a0\nAwkwardly, Peter cleared his throat. \u201cJessica said you wanted to speak with me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d Mr. Lewis checked himself. \u201cThat is, we were hoping that we could - we were worried that -\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe couple were avoiding his eyes actively, and shifting nervously in their seats. Between them sat Tony, looking desperate and contrite all at once.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCould I speak to Tony alone, please?\u201d Peter ventured. It was one thing to discuss an incredibly emotional and touchy subject with someone who he had already discussed it with; it was another to have the conversation equivalent of pulling fingernails with two people walking on eggshells around him.\n\u00a0\nMrs. Lewis frowned. \u201cI'm not so sure that -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease, Mom,\u201d Tony jumped in. \u201cCan I talk to him alone?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer gaze softened as she looked to her son, but her frown remained. \u201cI don't know\u2026 We don't know him all that well, all things considered, and -\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe was scared to leave her son after what happened, Peter realized. May had been that way for a while after Skip; it had taken months for her to be comfortable leaving him with anyone again, and even then, she had to have known them for ages.\n\u00a0\nShe even had a full background check done on his fifth grade teacher. Mr. Thomas actually did turn out to be a felon under an assumed name, so May felt justified in her paranoia.\n\u00a0\nThe school had quickly found a new teacher, and then suggested that Peter transfer to Midtown Science, the chain of public schools with a focus on science and math; they also claimed that May\u2019s actions had no effect on their decision. Peter doubted this, but was too happy to finally escape the land of arts and crafts and shiny stickers to care.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut it's  Spider-Man, Mom.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright,\u201d she eventually acquiesced. \u201cBut we'll only be one room over,\u201d she declared. \u201cJust call if you need us.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOnce they left, Tony shifted nervously in his seat. \u201cDo you hate me?\u201d he piped up.\n\u00a0\nPeter blinked. \u201cWhy would I hate you?\u201d he asked, bewildered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s my fault you\u2019re all over the news!\u201d Tony blurted. \u201cIt\u2019s because of me that everyone knows what happened!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Tony,\u201d Peter vowed. \u201cIt would have happened eventually. It\u2019s the nature of the news cycle; they get their claws into everything. How have you been doing with everything?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey arrested Judy,\u201d Tony informed him, looking uncertain. \u201cSent an officer to her house, and dragged her back in cuffs and everything.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter watched him carefully. \u201cAnd how are you feeling about all of that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Tony mumbled. \u201cJudy\u2026 She was nice to me, before\u2026. what happened. And now they think she\u2019s gonna go to prison! I didn\u2019t mean to get her in so much trouble!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat she did was wrong, Tony, and there are consequences to actions. And if she  doesn\u2019t go to prison for what happened, there\u2019s always the chance that she\u2019ll do it again with another kid. I know that it may seem like all the nice memories lessens the bad ones, but they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\n That concept\u2026 that had been something Peter had struggled with for ages. Skip had been his best - only - friend; he had been the only kid that paid any sort of positive attention to Peter. The idea that it hadn\u2019t been real had been something Peter had refused to comprehend, let alone accept.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d Tony nodded, glumly. He didn\u2019t seem convinced.\n\u00a0\nIt was a process.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you sure that you\u2019re not mad at me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m not,\u201d Peter soothed. \u201cGive it a few days, and it\u2019ll all blow over.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nfriend noun |\\frend\\ : a person who you like or enjoy being with, a person who helps or supports someone or something (such as a cause or charity)\n\u00a0\nResearch always helped clear Peter\u2019s head.\n\u00a0\nIf he had a problem, he went to the library with it. A few hours amongst the dusty tomes, and\u00a0he\u2019d usually be able to come up with a solution for it.\n\u00a0\nBut this time, with this problem, Peter wasn\u2019t so sure.\n\u00a0\nHis past problems had been teaching himself physics. His past problems had included dense texts about Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity, the Laws of Thermodynamics, and whether or not May\u2019s meatloaf was actually slowly killing them (it wasn\u2019t, unfortunately - then he might have had a valid argument towards discontinuing the dish).\n\u00a0\nWith this problem, Peter didn\u2019t even know where to  begin. \n\u00a0\nHis search for answers started with a table \u00a0at the front of the building, in clear line of sight of the librarians. The library was right next to their apartment complex, and the librarians all adored Peter, so May and Ben were alright with walking him to building and dropping him off until he was done, since the attendants had agreed to check in on him periodically. Usually, Peter sat at his usual table in the back, where it was quiet and unlikely that he would be discovered by bullies, but this time, he chose the table farthest from that one as possible.\n\u00a0\nHe had met Skip at that table.\n\u00a0\nHis fruitless search had ended with a frustrated Peter leafing his way through a Merrian-Webster dictionary, confusion in his mind and desperation in his blood. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRunning away had already been ruled out, as the likelihood of Peter surviving on the streets was negligible, and he loved May and Ben too much to try. Likewise, Peter had also ruled out anonymous tips to the police - likely to be ignored - and avoiding Skip until he was big enough to fight back - too long of a time frame, too high of a chance of failure.\n\u00a0\nThe problem, Peter decided, was that he didn\u2019t have enough data about the situation. He needed to understand the situation itself, understand Skip\u2019s argument, and understand the opposing argument before he made any final decisions.\n\u00a0\nSkip had said that they were friends. Repeatedly, he had claimed that what they did was alright, because they were friends and friends did favors for one another. That Peter owed this to Skip.\n\u00a0\nPeter frowned. He  had enjoyed being around Skip, before the older boy started\u2026 started. But now, he preferred being as far away from him as possible. But did that matter? Was it only his initial reaction that was relevant, or could it change as they went?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nfavor   noun | fa\u2022vor | \\f\u0101-v\u0259r\\: a kind or helpful act that you do for someone; approval, support, or popularity; preference for one person, group, etc., over another.\n\u00a0\nWell, that wasn't helpful at all.\n\u00a0\nDid this fall under the umbrella of favors? It wasn't necessarily an act that Peter was doing for Skip so much as something that Skip did to Peter, with zero heed to any protests that Peter might have. But the definition didn't mention anything about consent. Did it matter if Peter said no? (Because he had; he had said no until his throat was hoarse, and  Skip didn't stop.) \n\u00a0\nPeter decided to look up one last definition.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nrape   noun | \\r\u0101p\\: an act or instance of robbing or despoiling or carrying away a person by force; unlawful sexual activity and usually sexual intercourse carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against the will usually of a female or with a person who is beneath a certain age or incapable of valid consent \u2014 compare SEXUAL ASSAULT, STATUTORY RAPE; an outrageous violation.\n\u00a0\nIt did not blow over.\n\u00a0\nInstead, the previously mercurial media had decided to focus on one thing for the first time in history. Namely: him.\n\u00a0\nMaybe it wouldn't have been so bad if the news hadn't broken so soon after the - as it had been affectionately dubbed by the public - \u201c#HydraSmackDown.\u201d After the incident in Times Square, people had begun to focus less on the far-off, hidden away heroes that were the Avengers - especially seeing as they only showed up for alien invasions and cities falling from the sky - and more on the commonplace, constant heroes whose presence was shown everyday, on every street as they battled normal crime. Specifically, they focused on everyone that had actually  come  to the \u201c#HydraSmackDown\u201d - the \u201cDefenders,\u201d apparently.\n\u00a0\nFoggy had thought that \u201cReckless Idiots in Spandex\u201d was more accurate, but Twitter had spoken, and the name stuck.\n\u00a0\nAnd, well, Spider-Man was the newest of the group, and therefore the least was known about him. Jones and Cage didn't even have a secret identity; their pasts were open books to the public, which had been exploited on more than one occasion. And while Matt\u2019s identity was safe, people knew a heck of a lot more about Daredevil than they did about Spider-Man. Granted, that information included \u201cnot actually a terrorist,\u201d \u201cpossibly the actual Devil,\u201d \u201cterrible taste in costumes,\u201d and \u201cscary as Hell,\u201d but it was still a lot more than what the public had on Spider-Man. For the first few months of Peter\u2019s vigilantism, he had been nothing but an urban legend. And when people finally realized that there actually was some weirdo swinging around on webs and fighting crime, it was mostly the criminals that Peter beat up that made the connection. By the time the public figured out that those videos were real, they were confronted with the unpleasant truth that they were all the information they had.\n\u00a0\nUntil now, that is.\n\u00a0\nWhich meant that for the past week, Peter\u2019s past had been the subject of headlines, news broadcasts, and social media. For the past week, the thing that Peter was trying to  forget  had been thrown in his face  over and over and over again. \n\u00a0\nPeter shuffled into Stark Industries, clenching his backpack strap tightly as he slid into the side elevator. The world had not stopped turning just because he was - slightly - distressed; he still had his usual obligations to fill. One of those obligations being the meetings for the grant that Mr. Stark had  actually given him, instead of it just being a ruse to get past Peter\u2019s aunt.\n\u00a0\nPeter had  money. \n\u00a0\nWell, technically speaking, he had money to develop new tech, and that tech would be evaluated for marketability by Stark Industries, but if it  was marketable, he would get royalties from that. And, while he had only one of these meetings previously, some of his inventions had been released by Stark, meaning Peter was turning a profit.\n\u00a0\nSo yes, Peter had  money. \n\u00a0\nIt was a novel experience.\n\u00a0\nThe last time Peter had come, it had actually been fun. Mr. Stark had appointed himself to be the one to evaluate Peter\u2019s work, and the meeting - which Peter had been fretting over for weeks beforehand - had ended up being like one big episode of MythBusters. Apparently, all those rumors of how Stark was in the lab were true, complete with the explosions and the random streams of fire extinguisher. It was  awesome. \n\u00a0\nBut now, Peter was coming back after  that had been blared across the TVs for days.\n\u00a0\nMaybe Mr. Stark hadn't noticed, Peter thought desperately. He had a tendency to hole up in his labs for an inhuman amount of time, right? Maybe he hadn't seen the news. Maybe he  had, but he wouldn't mention it. Maybe it wouldn't affect this.\n\u00a0\nAnd maybe Iron Man and Captain America would hug out their differences.\n\u00a0\nThe elevator dinged. Peter was screwed. He stepped through the doors with as much enthusiasm as a man headed to the electric chair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are cheating on me!\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter blinked, bewildered. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWith lawyers,\u201d Stark declared, crinkling his nose in distaste. \u201cWhat are they giving you? Drugs? Money? Drugs? Petey, Petey, Petey, I can hook you up such better stuff.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think this entire conversation is illegal,\u201d Peter pondered, a smile twitching at his lips. He'd been worried over nothing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou'd know.  Lawyers.\u201d \n\u00a0\nStark was seated in the corner of his lab, the top half of the Iron Man suit on as he fiddled with the chest plate, sparks flying as he jiggled tools in the mechanisms.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat's wrong with lawyers?\u201d Peter asked defensively. \u201cAnd how'd you even know that I was working with them?\u201d\n\u00a0\nStark rolled his eyes. \u201cOne of them showed up at your school and filled out the paperwork to make you their intern. Which brings me back to my original point: You\u2019re intellectually cheating on me! And you're not even doing it with scientists! How could you, Peter?  How. Could. You?  You\u2019re my intern; you\u2019re supposed to be blindly loyal to  me! \u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I'm your  grant receiver,\u201d Peter corrected, exasperated. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference. And the terms of the grant never said that I couldn\u2019t intern elsewhere.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidtown Science had a policy meant to encourage extracurriculars, which allowed students with internships to leave school early for work. Upon learning this, Matt and Foggy had agreed to change Peter from that weird kid that occasionally fought crime with Matt and showed up randomly to fix their office supplies, to that weird unpaid intern that occasionally fought crime with Matt and showed up less-randomly to fix their office supplies. Of course, at the time it was because Peter needed to leave early to fight a ninja death cult with Matt - it was a time sensitive matter, Foggy had refused to let Matt One Man Army(TM) \u00a0it - but they couldn't exactly cancel the internship after one day.\n\u00a0\nStill, Peter found he liked it. His ties to both science and law had made him officially \u201cwell-rounded;\u201d he had more ancient tech to cannibalize than ever before; and they never got mad if he was late because he had to jump into a burning building on the way.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...And how\u2019d you know Foggy was at my school?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI hacked your district\u2019s database.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s illegal, Mr. Stark.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour lawyer is showing, Webs,\u201d Stark muttered childishly. \u201cWhat do you even do for them anyway? You\u2019re a  science geek, not a law nerd!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI fix things,\u201d Peter shrugged. \u201cTheir tech sucks; I make it suck less. Sometimes I help pull up files or dig through old cases And I fix things for their clients.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSince when do lawyers double as handymans?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re representing tenements against their landlord, they do,\u201d Peter shot back.\n\u00a0\nStark glanced at him, puzzled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIn a tenement case, usually a landlord is trying to kick their renters out, despite that they have a contract protecting them,\u201d Peter explained. \u201cSo the tenements go to Nelson and Murdock, who file a civil suit. When that happens, the owner usually sends people around to make the place unlivable on the pretext of making repairs. I fix what\u2019s broken, so that they aren\u2019t forced to leave before it even hits court.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd then Nelson and Murdock gets the landlord in the legal arena?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, then the landlord usually hires someone to assault and/or kill one of the tenements as an intimidation technique,\u201d Peter replied thoughtfully. \u201cAnd I spend a few nights waiting on the rooftops as Spider-Man to beat up whoever they sent.\u201d Well, mostly Daredevil did that work, but Stark didn\u2019t need to know how closely affiliated the vigilante was with the firm. \u201cAnd  then Nelson and Murdock gets the landlord in the legal arena.\u201d\n\u00a0\nStark looked disturbed. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter agreed. Suddenly, worry began to brew in his gut. Stark knew about his affiliation with Nelson and Murdock, and he had no qualms about digging into people\u2019s histories. Did he know about Daredevil? \u201cSo, how else have you been stalking my firm?\u201d\n\u00a0\nStark shrugged. \u201cNelson and Murdock: founded by two bleeding heart roommates from Columbia. Graduated top of their class, got highly sought after internships, only to turn down an actual job in favor of rescuing the innocent and fighting Wilson Fisk, apparently. One of them\u2019s blind - which explains your strange fascination with accessibility tech for the visually impaired; those are doing pretty well in the market, by the way. Only other workers are you and the first person they ever defended, one Karen Page. Oh, and they\u2019re pretty closely associated with Daredevil, probably how you met them. Devil\u2019s been relaying his internet purchases through the blind guy; smart, if you ask me. Nobody would ever suspect the sightless lawyer to be the one aiding and abetting a known vigilante.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA part of Peter relaxed; Stark didn\u2019t suspect Matt - yet. Another part of him zeroed in on another one of the man\u2019s statements. \u201cMr. Stark, it\u2019s really,  really illegal to be looking at Matt\u2019s internet history without a warrant.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDetails, details,\u201d he waved off. \u201cThey, uh, also just took on the Winter Soldier as a client,\u201d Stark continued tightly. \u201cKinda makes their \u2018only innocent policy\u2019 a bit hypocritical now, doesn\u2019t it? Though, what are the odds that you\u2019d end up working for the same people representing Barnes?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter bit his lip. \u201cPretty high, considering I was the one that gave Captain Rogers their business card.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe sparking of Stark\u2019s tools paused. Then, they started back up again. \u201cWhy would you do that, Peter?\u201d he asked tightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause he deserved representation. And because I decrypted the Winter Soldier files from the SHIELD drop.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh?\u201d Stark asked, his voice forcibly light. \u201cThat couldn\u2019t have been easy; the firewall on those things gave even JARVIS trouble. Takes determination to do something like that. Curious about something?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter replied carefully, watching his mentor for a reaction. \u201cSome of the things that Rogers said didn\u2019t line up with what you had told me. I wanted to find out the truth for myself.\u201d No response. \u201cMr. Stark, why didn\u2019t you tell me who we were going after?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA pause. Then, \u201cI did.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, you told me we were bringing in the guy responsible for the bombing on the Accords Convention. You never told me that we were going after a Prisoner of War that had been tortured and brainwashed for over seventy years!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWould it have made a difference?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes!\u201d Peter exploded. \u201cIt would have made a massive difference! Namely,  I wouldn\u2019t have come!\u201d \n\u00a0\nFrankly, Peter still felt massively guilty about coming in the first place. He had just hopped on Team Iron Man, with almost no information or justification as why he should do so. What was his reasoning? That he didn\u2019t want his aunt to find out he was moonlighting as a vigilante? Didn\u2019t change the fact that he had contributed to multiple people being held without trial in an underwater prison-submarine.\n\u00a0\nGranted, he did - does - believe that supervision is necessary for international level superheroism - country\u2019s borders should be respected, the individual laws of each country should be followed - but it shouldn\u2019t be at the cost of the rights of the heroes themselves. After Germany, Peter read up on the Accords: Forced conscription, required registration - like what the freaking  Nazi\u2019s did - suspended habeas corpus, lives being subjected to the whims of an unelected, unknown Oversight Committee\u2026\n\u00a0\nThey weren\u2019t making heroes responsible for their actions; they were making them into weapons controlled by the UN.\n\u00a0\nStark clenched his tools tighter, a stubborn set to his jaw. \u201cHe\u2019s not as innocent as you make him out to be.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike how?\u201d Peter demanded.\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t respond.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLook,\u201d Peter sighed, \u201cI obviously have no idea what happened between all of you - and don\u2019t say it\u2019s the Accords, because it\u2019s not. Captain Rogers is in Brooklyn; he wants to talk with you, but he doesn\u2019t know if you want to talk to him. I\u2019m not saying you should\u2026 but you could.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor a moment, Stark\u2019s jaw tightened even further, then relaxed. \u201cRight,\u201d he said faux brightly. \u201cLet's talk grant work, shall we? What'd you got for me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSlowly, Peter nodded, and pulled his projects out of his backpack.\n\u00a0\nThe atmosphere of the lab relaxed notably as they slipped into science jargon. It was easy, Peter supposed, to lose themselves in equations and diagrams. At least, it was much easier to do that than it was to face their personal demons.\n\u00a0\nSuddenly, Peter smiled. For a little while, he had forgotten the chaos being dredged up from the past. \u201cThanks, Mr. Stark,\u201d he said honestly.\n\u00a0\nStark looked at him warily. \u201cThis feels like a trap. What is it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Peter answered, shaking his head. \u201cJust thanks.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he nodded slowly. \u201cWhatever. Come on, I\u2019ll show you how your portable braille notetaker is selling. FRIDAY, pull up Mr. Parker\u2019s file.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight away, sir,\u201d came the Irish lilt.\n\u00a0\nOver the holo-table, a row of digital papers blared to life. At the center was a rising and falling line graph, showing the trend of success for Peter\u2019s products. Another one of the files, one to the side of the line, caught Peter\u2019s eye. His stomach clenched. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s what?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBut Peter was already sliding the windows aside in favor of a too-familiar document.\n\u00a0\nA police report.\n\u00a0\n Peter\u2019s  police report. The same one that had been filled out before his eyes, as Peter touched that stupid, anatomically correct doll in the same places Skip had touched him while robotically describing in explicit detail  exactly what happened whenever Skip babysat. Something cold curled up in the pit of Peter\u2019s stomach and dug in its claws. \u201cThis.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh - shit, kid, that wasn\u2019t meant to be there. FRIDAY I told you to put that in my  private file -\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter flipped through even more of the reports, scanning the documents with an increasing panic. Hospital records, counselor reports, court records -\n\u00a0\nAnd the current whereabouts of one Steven Westcott, complete with camera footage.\n\u00a0\nThe something-cold tightened its claws and  twisted. \n\u00a0\nPeter had known, on a level, that Skip would be out of jail already. After all, he had gotten off easy, taking the plea bargain and everything. He had been underage, a first time offender, and had cooperated with authorities. Skip had gotten good grades; he was a star basketball player; by all means, the boy was full of potential.\n\u00a0\nSkip would have had a good future ahead of him, if it hadn\u2019t been for the small fact that he was a pedophile.\n\u00a0\nKnowing that he was out of prison had affected Peter less than one might think. Granted, there was a part of him that was constantly  squirming  at the thought that the person who had stolen so much from him was walking free, but Peter had done his best to ignore that part. Surprisingly, that had been easy to do. With the last image he had of Skip being one of him getting dragged off in cuffs, he could ignore the one of him being  released  from those cuffs. With the restraining order, Peter had room to breathe. He had moved on; he focused on fixing the parts of his life that had been broken. Peter had brought his grades up from where they plummeted while Skip was still around, made friends with little, safe,  his own age  Harry Osborn from his class, and tried to forget.\n\u00a0\nAnd if he still flinched whenever May touched him too suddenly, or if one of his classmates had called him Einstein and Peter spent the entirety of study hall in the bathroom having a panic attack\u2026 well, he would work on that.\n\u00a0\nOf course, refusing to acknowledge something that you know to be true is very different from seeing the proof right before your eyes and still not realizing it.\n\u00a0\nPrison hadn\u2019t changed Skip, Peter realized as he stared at the footage; he had the same platinum hair, same devil-may-care grin, same  everything.  \u201cWhat are you doing with these?\u201d Peter hissed. \u201cThese - these were sealed files.  Private  files. And - and  Skip - you\u2019re watching   Skip -\u201d \n\u00a0\nPeter felt violated. Throughout the entire process, officials had promised him that the only people that would see the reports were those that had to for their jobs. They would be people that Peter didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t know him, and he would never have to look them in the face and know that they had seen the ugly proof of  that. \n\u00a0\nAnd Tony Stark had gone and walked all over those boundaries as if they didn\u2019t exist.\n\u00a0\nStark was talking now, babbling really, with careless explanations and waving hands. Peter watched him numbly. \u201c- statistically speaking, he\u2019s going to be a repeat offender, and I can pull a few strings and make sure the key is thrown away for good. The surveillance is just until Westcott slips up -\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe recidivism rate for sexual offenders was ninety-eight percent, Peter\u2019s brain informed him. A ninety-eight percent chance that he would do what he did again; a ninety-eight percent chance that some other little kid would never be the same. When he first learnt that statistic, it had given Peter nightmares for weeks. Now, with Spider-Man, it had been easier to cope with. Because while they may try again and again, Peter could be there to stop them. He  would be there.\n\u00a0\nThat rationality really gave Peter mixed feelings about the surveillance.\n\u00a0\nOn one hand, it would obviate exactly what Peter had been scared of all those years. With Stark watching, Skip wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt another kid, because he\u2019d have Iron Man pounding down his door the moment he tried.\n\u00a0\nOn the other hand, it created a whole new slew of problems. If Iron Man  did pound down some random pedophile\u2019s door, it wouldn\u2019t be a far jump to connect him to Spider-Man. And while Peter didn\u2019t care about the possible threat to his secret as much if it meant protecting other kids, the surveillance in itself could pose a threat. In the past, some people may have let anything Tony Stark did slide for the sole reason that he was Iron Man. Now, though, after the shitshows that were Sokovia, Lagos, Germany, ect., superheroes didn\u2019t have the same blind trust that they once did; he wouldn\u2019t be able to get away with as much. And if some judge decided that any video footage would be inadmissible in court, because Stark hadn\u2019t had any warrant or even official capacity to watch him, Skip would go free.\n\u00a0\nHe would go free, and be able to hurt even more kids.\n\u00a0\nStark was still talking, Peter realized. \u201c-\u2019cuz I understand now, kid, about the whole, \u2018if you can do something and you don\u2019t, it happens because of you\u2019 thing -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter interrupted. \u201cAre - are you saying that you think that I\u2019m Spider-Man because of  Skip?\u201d \n\u00a0\nStark blinked. \u201cYeah. It all makes sense now, so you don\u2019t have to worry about -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy uncle\u2019s dead, Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter informed him coldly.\n\u00a0\nIn all honesty, Peter could see how Stark could draw the connection between Skip and his decision to be Spider-Man. Heck, the majority of the country had made the exact same one. It was a reasonable assumption that something like that could trigger Peter\u2019s desire to protect others.\n\u00a0\nExcept.\n\u00a0\nIt had always been for Ben.\n\u00a0\nWhen Peter first went out, it was with the sound of a gunshot ringing in his ears and the memory of too-warm blood covering his hands. Every time he saved someone, it had been because his uncle had taught him the importance of standing up for what was right long before Peter had ever heard the name Skip.\n\u00a0\nIt was because Peter\u2019s family had an irreplaceable gap in it, and he would do  anything to make sure that those gaps didn\u2019t fill other families lives.\n\u00a0\nPetty criminals was what they called the people Peter fought. Petty crime, something that only Daredevil, Spider-Man, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage - and, more recently, Captain America - had cared about enough to stop.\n\u00a0\nPetty crime was such an ugly, misleading term.\n\u00a0\nIn the world of super villains and alien armies, it had become a catch-all for any crime that didn\u2019t involve a diabolical plot for world domination, a stupid costume, and special powers. It had become an umbrella term for all the  lesser  crimes, the ones that no  superhero  had ever shown up to stop.\n\u00a0\nLike murder. Like rape. Like assault and human trafficking and the thousand other crimes that destroyed lives  every single day. \n\u00a0\nSometimes, people called the Defenders vigilantes, as if they should be offended by it. They acted as if they should strive to be more like  superheroes, complete with only showing up when the world was falling around your ears. As if it was some terrible, horrific insult to be called a vigilante. It wasn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nIt was a  badge of honor. \n\u00a0\nOne that Peter put on everyday, along with a red and blue suit and the memory of an uncle he had lost to  petty crime. \n\u00a0\nAnd to make  this  all about Skip, to claim it was just his way of  coping  - like every single psychologist that had gone on the news with  insight  into the psyche of Spider-Man - would debase all that. Yes, Peter was still affected by what had happened. Yes, when he hit sexual predators the hardest, it  was personal.\n\u00a0\nBut Peter was still Ben\u2019s nephew, and he was  so much more than what Skip had made him.\n\u00a0\nSo when Stark acted like that one thing of his life defined everything he had built, Peter took offense.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s  dead,\u201d  Peter spat. \u201cHe was shot in the street over  thirty-seven dollars.  Did you come across  that file when you were digging through my life?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat? I -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you come across the part where I could have stopped the man that did it?\u201d Peter asked, stepping closer. \u201cThe day he died, I was there, less than a block away. And the man that murdered him, the man that decided his life was worth less than the contents of his wallet - I had seen him first, mugging tourists  five minutes  before he murdered my uncle. I had seen him, and I hadn\u2019t stopped him, because  it wasn\u2019t supposed to be my problem.  And everything that happened afterwards was  my fault.  So when I put on my suit, Mr. Stark, it\u2019s for my  uncle,\u201d he finished, hammering his point home with a poke to the man\u2019s chest. The gold titanium alloy crunched inwards, a sizeable dent the result of Peter\u2019s strength.\n\u00a0\nPeter found that he didn\u2019t care.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s  not  for  him,\u201d he finished, waving at the floating projection of Skip\u2019s face.\n\u00a0\nStark was staring at him now, a mixture of regret and surprise on his face. He sighed. \u201cLook, kid, I\u2019m really sorry I -\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter was really, really not interested in hearing whatever apologies the man had. Suddenly, he wanted to get out of that lab, and away from those files that were  never supposed to be there. \u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d he muttered, shouldering past the engineer.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter,  wait!\u201d \n\u00a0\nStumbling, he grabbed onto one of the nearby stainless steel tables. The metal crumpled in his grip. Peter released it as if he had been burned. There was a perfect mold of his handprint on the edge.\n\u00a0\nWincing, he thought back to the Iron Man chestplate. At the time, he hadn\u2019t cared about it, but now, he was remembering all the damage he could do when he lost control of his strength - which tended to happen whenever Peter was upset.\n\u00a0\nHe needed to calm down before he hurt someone.\n\u00a0\nPeter grabbed his backpack, nearly tearing off the strap by accident. Quickly, he walked over to the glass doors, only to stop in frustration. \u201cFRIDAY, could you open the doors?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course, Mr. Parker.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHold that order, FRIDAY,\u201d Stark corrected\n\u00a0\n\u201cLook,\u201d Peter interrupted, before Stark could say anything. \u201cWe both know that I can break through whatever this door is made out of, so it would be a  lot easier for everyone if you would just open it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor a moment, Peter thought the man would argue. But instead, Stark gave him one last conflicted look before he nodded, stepping back.\n\u00a0\nThe doors slid open. The elevator was already waiting for him.\n\u00a0\nStark let him leave.\n\u00a0\nPeter slid down the wall of the elevator, clenching his fists until his nails cut into his palms, drawing blood. He could handle this; he could  get this under control. \n\u00a0\nWhat was that Jones had said about calming down? Street names. Peter could do street names.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIngram Street,\u201d he began. \u201cPuritan Avenue. Ascan Avenue. Whitson Street. Greenway Stre-\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter choked.\n\u00a0\nBecause suddenly, all he could see was that stupid,  stupid  sign for Greenway Street -  Skip\u2019s  street - and he was seven years old again, walking with his aunt and uncle to his babysitter\u2019s house, trembling with fear but unable to tell his family  why. \n\u00a0\nPeter had been so  grateful when they moved after Ben\u2019s death, away from that sign filled with memories.\n\u00a0\nThe elevator opened.\n\u00a0\nPeter fled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you okay, Peter?\u201d May hummed, reaching up to brush the hair out of his eyes.\n\u00a0\nPeter flinched.\n\u00a0\nSlowly, May lowered her hand. She exchanged a not-at-all-subtle look with Ben. The had noticed something was wrong with Peter during the past few days; of course they had. His emotional state had been deteriorating by the day.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs everything okay, sweetheart?\u201d she asked, blatantly concerned. \u201cYou know you can tell us anything.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNo, Peter really couldn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nBefore, he could. Before, he could go to his aunt and uncle about anything, and he knew it would be fixed.\n\u00a0\nBefore he met Skip, that is.\n\u00a0\nAnd now, Peter couldn\u2019t see a way out of this situation. Granted, he could go to his aunt and uncle, and that  might  fix it - though his fears that they\u2019d do  nothing  gnawed at him constantly - but what then? What about after? Peter couldn\u2019t change the past; the memories wouldn\u2019t magically disappear. What if he never stopped feeling the hands  all over his body? Worse, what if he did tell May and Ben, and they started treating him differently?\n\u00a0\nWhat if nothing was ever the same again?\n\u00a0\nIt was better to wait, until he had enough data to make a decision. It was better to do nothing, until the fear that he would screw this all up stopped eating away at his insides.\n\u00a0\nIf he could last that long, that is.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said unconvincingly. \u201cTired.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMay looked doubtful. \u201cAre the kids in school bothering you again?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter looked down.\n\u00a0\nMay took that as confirmation. Her hand slammed down on the table. \u201cI knew it! I swear, I am going to the principal tomorrow and -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo!\u201d Peter interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really! You don\u2019t need to go to the principal\u2019s office!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not about to sit by and let the other kids hurt you,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI\u2019m your aunt, Peter; I help you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s stomach clenched. \u201cNo one\u2019s hurting me,\u201d he lied. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve just been studying too much lately.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMay carefully watched his face for falsehoods. \u201cAre you sure, Peter?\u201d\n\u00a0\nFunnily enough, Peter found he was much better at lying recently. \u201cYes,\u201d he promised.\n\u00a0\nSlowly, May nodded. \u201cOkay,\u201d she sighed. Then, she gave him a smile. \u201cWell, this ought to cheer you up: you\u2019re going over to Skip\u2019s house tomorrow. You\u2019re always happier after you hang out with him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd once, Peter had been.\n\u00a0\nBefore.\n\u00a0\nPeter was finding that it was much more difficult to have a not-crisis - because it wasn\u2019t a crisis, Skip hadn\u2019t been a crisis since Peter was  seven,  it definitely  was not a crisis - when you had obligations to society.\n\u00a0\nLike the fact that he had an internship to go to.\n\u00a0\nGranted, Matt, Foggy, and Karen probably wouldn\u2019t be upset if Peter called in sick, but they would be worried, and Peter didn\u2019t want that. Besides, he refused to give this  situation any more power over his life than it already had.\n\u00a0\nHe was done with Skip\u2019s control over him.\n\u00a0\nThe half-hour walk from Stark Tower to Nelson and Murdock helped calm him down. Peter sucked in the brisk air, veered away from any fellow pedestrians, and kept his hands in his pockets so he couldn\u2019t hurt anything. Then, he was jogging up a set of decrepit stairs in a forgotten corner of Hell\u2019s Kitchen, and the door to the tiny law office was swinging open before Peter could think about it.\n\u00a0\nThey actually had clients, Peter realized in disbelief. Clients that Peter  knew. Clients that knew Peter, but didn\u2019t know they knew them.\n\u00a0\nCaptain America, the Winter Soldier, and the Falcon were sitting across the conference room table from the entire staff of Nelson and Murdock, a spread of papers between them.\n\u00a0\nGranted, he had known that they had hired Matt and Foggy, but that was very different from actually  seeing them there. As normal, non-powered Peter Parker.\n\u00a0\nA facade that may not last that long, considering Captain Rogers knew Spider-Man\u2019s real name.\n\u00a0\nAnd they were all staring at him. Right. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to interrupt your meeting.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Matt said smoothly. \u201cThis is our intern, Peter,\u201d he introduced, turning to the men. \u201cHe\u2019s just going to be fixing the copy ma -  what did Stark do?\u201d \n\u00a0\nSince meeting Daredevil, Peter had had to deal with certain truths.\n\u00a0\nOne of them was that Matthew Murdock absolutely  hated Tony Stark.\n\u00a0\nTechnically, that hadn\u2019t started until  after Matt met Peter, and learned all about the Airport Incident. Namely, the man that had some kind of very personal grudge against anybody that used child soldiers found out that Iron Man had dragged a teenager into his war against the world\u2019s greatest super soldier, and formed a lasting hatred.\n\u00a0\nPeter was actually really, very lucky that Matt didn\u2019t lurk outside of Stark Tower in full Daredevil regalia, lying in wait for him.\n\u00a0\nThis also meant that he was very ready to address any perceived wrong that Stark may or may not have committed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat makes you think he did something?\u201d Peter asked defensively. Which, granted, he did, but Matt didn\u2019t need to know that\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou smell like Stark Industries and frustration. Explain.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA very unwelcome light of realization entered the good captain\u2019s eyes. \u201cWait,  Peter?\u201d  he asked slowly. \u201cPeter Benjamin Parker?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter paused. \u201cOh my God, Captain America just called me by my full name. I didn\u2019t even do anything, and I still feel ashamed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Matt sighed. He sounded pained.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSeriously, I feel like I just shot a bald eagle or something,\u201d Peter insisted. \u201cAnd that I have to join the Army in penance.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to join the Army, Peter.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy not? I can be patriotic. Like, not cover myself in the America flag and fight Nazi\u2019s patriotic - no offense, Captain, you be you and all that - but I can totally serve my country.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Rogers blurted.\n\u00a0\nPeter stared at him. \u201cFifteen,\u201d he admitted.\n\u00a0\nThe captain had turned an interesting shade of white. Peter hadn\u2019t realized that there was a color whiter than chalk. \u201cFifteen,\u201d he repeated.  \u201cFifteen.\u201d \n\u00a0\nFoggy watched the national icon in worry. \u201cPeter, I think you broke Captain America.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI did not break him,\u201d Peter protested. \u201cMaybe Matt broke him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt frowned. \u201cFoggy, I did not break our only paying customer. Peter broke him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cFifteen.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cBoys,\u201d Karen threatened.\n\u00a0\nEveryone instantly obeyed her unspoken request to start acting like normal human beings. Karen was scary like that.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you the same Peter Benjamin Parker that told me about this place?\u201d Captain Rogers interrupted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Peter sighed, scratching his head sheepishly. \u201cI am. Nice to meet you for real, Captain.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI dropped a bridge on you,\u201d he responded, his face twisting in horror. \u201cDuring the fight, I dropped a  bridge  on a  fifteen year old.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cYou did  what?\u201d Matt snapped.\n\u00a0\nPeter winced. \u201cIt was a small bridge,\u201d he soothed. After the Stark fallout, he had made the executive decision to not tell Matt about the whole \u2018Captain America knocked out the supports of the jet bridge I was standing under,\u2019 thing. It didn\u2019t seem to be a big deal, in Peter\u2019s opinion. It had been a fight; it was only expected that something like that would happen.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt weighed almost ten tons!\u201d Rogers whispered in alarm.\n\u00a0\nInstead of looking upset, a scary calm descended on Matt\u2019s features. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor a moment, Peter was confused, before a horrified realization came over him. He stared at the Captain. \u201cI invited you to sparring practice.  Please tell me you haven\u2019t accepted yet.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRogers looked confused. \u201cI did...\u201d he replied slowly.\n\u00a0\nPeter groaned. Foggy and Karen looked completely unsympathetic.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to come if you don\u2019t want me to -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re coming,\u201d Matt declared with finality.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMatt\u2019s got this whole \u2018no one hurts my apprentice in vigilantism except me\u2019 thing going on,\u201d Peter confided. \u201cEven if it\u2019s  totally fine. So he\u2019s not going to spar with you; he\u2019s going to try his hardest to kick your ass.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t hurt you,\u201d Matt protested.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou kicked me in the head last week.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat was sparring practice.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYet I felt pain. Therefore: hurt.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan Matt win this fight, though?\u201d Karen pondered absently. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s  Captain America.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cNever underestimate power of Matt\u2019s Catholicism,\u201d Foggy warned. \u201cGuy can ignore pain like nothing else. Even if he doesn\u2019t win, Rogers still won\u2019t be getting off unharmed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou guys can\u2019t blame everything on my religion,\u201d Matt sighed, rubbing his temple.\n\u00a0\nThe Falcon - some ex-paratrooper named Wilson, if Peter was remembering correctly - stared at Peter.  \u201cYou\u2019re the motor mouth?\u201d\nMatt  definitely looked like he was in pain. \u201cPeter,\u201d he groaned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI totally did.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid what?\u201d Wilson asked, still glancing at Peter warily, as if he was about to start spewing quips then and there.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe talking thing,\u201d Matt said, pinching the bridge of his nose. He had been doing that a lot more since he met Peter, according to Foggy. \u201cHis stupid distraction technique.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy highly efficient distraction technique,\u201d Peter corrected.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe annoys people into submission,\u201d Matt explained. \u201cDuring fights. He just keeps talking until they\u2019re so distracted and confused they don\u2019t see his next punch coming. Or they\u2019re grateful for it; we\u2019re not sure which.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOne guy even surrendered to get me to shut up,\u201d Peter preened. \u201cIt was  awesome.\u201d \n\u00a0\nEveryone stared.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut I\u2019m very sorry about using it on you,\u201d Peter amended. \u201cReally. Very sorry.\u201d Did that sound convincing enough? \u201cRegret,\u201d he added on meaningfully.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d Wilson shook his head. He didn't seem convinced. \u201cWhat I don't get is why you were there in the first place. Most fifteen year olds aren't that involved in politics, and certainly not enough that they'd be willing to fly to Germany and fight Captain America. How'd Stark convince you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh he didn't,\u201d Matt broke in tightly. \u201cHe just walked into Peter\u2019s apartment, told his aunt he was taking Peter for grant work, then told Peter that if he didn't come to Germany he'd tell his Aunt May about his after school activities. Peter didn't actually know what it was even about until a half hour before they landed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt was a bit more complicated than that, Matt,\u201d Peter protested.\n\u00a0\nMatt continued as if he hadn't heard Peter. \u201cWhich is why Tony Stark has a standing invitation to  sparring  practice.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRogers\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cStark spars with you?\u201d he asked, curiosity and a bit of desperation barely restrained in his tone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNope,\u201d Peter snorted. \u201cI refuse to be party to Matt\u2019s schemes to beat up billionaires, so I\u2019ve never given him the invitation. He still doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis brings me back to my original question: What did Stark do this time?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe didn't do anything!\u201d Peter lied. Which probably wasn't the best idea seeing as Matt could hear heart beats, but Peter didn't have many options.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour heartrate\u2019s elevated, you smell like anger and frustration, and you dented the doorknob when you opened it,\u201d Matt listed.\n\u00a0\nPeter swore. He had thought that he\u2019d gotten his strength under control. \u201cI can fix that,\u201d he promised.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd is that copper I taste in the air?\u201d Matt asked, frowning.\n\u00a0\nFoggy\u2019s head darted up, zeroing in on Peter\u2019s bloodied palms in moments. \u201cYep, he's bleeding.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm going to fix the copy machine,\u201d Peter groaned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cStop right there, moody teenager!\u201d Foggy ordered. \u201cYou know the rules: No open wounds in the office. Sit.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut you\u2019re in the middle of a meeting!\u201d Peter protested. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only a couple scrapes.\u201d Quickly, he rubbed his palms on his pants\u2019 legs in an attempt to get off some of the residual blood. \u201cSee? I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy crinkled his nose up in disgust. \u201cYou did not just do that. Oh my God, sit, you caveman. We were just about to stop for a break when you walked in, so you\u2019re not interrupting anything. You can get back to bastardizing our poor copy machine later.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can make that thing so much cooler, if you\u2019d let me,\u201d Peter argued, dutifully taking a seat. \u201cSo much of that monstrosity is unnecessary. I can shrink the hardware down to an eighth of the size, and use the rest of the space for useful stuff.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy returned, wielding a truly impressive first aid kit. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the world\u2019s tiniest panic room in our fax machine.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Matt attempted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIgnoring all protests that Peter could do it himself, Foggy grabbed the teenager\u2019s palms and began to apply antiseptic with a fervor. \u201cDo it yourself,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cYou two are like wolves that lick their wounds and think \u2018Done! That\u2019s all the first aid needed!\u2019 And quit your smirking Murdock, don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t see you limping this morning! You\u2019re next!\u201d Foggy frowned, staring at the row of deep half-moons before him. \u201cDid you do this with your nails?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter winced. \u201cAccidentally, yeah. I was upset, and I lost control of my strength for a little while.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt glowered. \u201cWhat did Stark do?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet it go, Murdock,\u201d Peter said, rolling his eyes. \u201cHe meant well.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re sitting in my office injured. Doesn\u2019t matter if he  meant well, he -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe tracked down Skip, okay?\u201d Peter snapped.\n\u00a0\nEveryone stilled. \u201cSkip?\u201d Matt said, testing the word carefully.\n\u00a0\nAlready, Peter was regretting his outburst. \u201cYeah,\u201d he sighed. \u201cSkip. He had pulled up some reports that were supposed to be private and did some really illegal surveillance and made some presumptions\u2026 And I dunno, I snapped, okay? We\u2019re not talking about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAn awkward silence descended. Peter cleared his throat. \u201cSo\u2026 Captain, how\u2019s Brooklyn doing?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s, uh, good,\u201d he replied. \u201cI checked out those places you suggested. And those gangs Downtown won\u2019t be a problem anymore.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh? That\u2019s good. They didn\u2019t burn down your house, did they?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey threw the punk in a dumpster,\u201d Barnes chuckled. \u201cCame running over here the next day for tips.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter glanced at him in surprise. Up until now, Barnes had been silent, but had watched the interactions carefully. He had a new metal arm, Peter noted absently. Made from a different material than before. Was that vibranium? \u201cOh?\u201d he asked, cracking a smile. \u201cThat makes three of us now. Four, if you count Jones, but according to her, she jumped into that dumpster.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor a moment, the once Winter Soldier was silent. Then, \u201cYou\u2019re too young.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter ducked his head. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe you should listen.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Peter agreed. \u201cBut I won\u2019t. I\u2019ve got my reasons for doing what I do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnother awkward silence. Great, Peter groaned internally. More people who were drawing this back to Skip.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, yeah,\u201d the Captain broke in awkwardly. \u201cVigilantism is going good. Different, but good.\u201d A slight smile played on his lips. \u201cIt reminds me of before the serum, somehow.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter thought back through all history lessons, documentaries, and biographies made about Captain America. No matter how dramatized the story, they all had one thing in common: When Steve Rogers started out, it wasn\u2019t as the world\u2019s greatest soldier. It wasn\u2019t as a superhero.\n\u00a0\nInstead, it was as a scrawny kid in the back alleys of Brooklyn, standing up to every bully he could find.\n\u00a0\nHe wasn\u2019t so scrawny anymore, but the act itself was the same. After the chaos that he had gone through since waking up, maybe it would be good for him to get back to his roots.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd the case?\u201d Peter questioned, nodding towards the files. \u201cHow\u2019s that going? If you don\u2019t mind me asking, that is.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo charges have been filed yet,\u201d Karen explained. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re trying to stop this before it even goes to trial.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf it even gets a chance trial,\u201d Wilson muttered mutinously. \u201cWeren\u2019t too keen on even giving us lawyers, in Berlin. Might be the same case here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be,\u201d Foggy assured. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t have happened in Berlin, and it won\u2019t happen here. Things like that are exactly why the Accords were doomed from the start, with or without the Spandex Squad over there,\u201d he proclaimed, waving at Peter and Matt.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Rogers asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHave you ever heard of the 2001 Patriot Act?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s been mentioned. Don\u2019t know too much about it, though; I\u2019ve had a lot to catch up on.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt was post 9/11,\u201d Foggy explained. \u201cBush administration. At first, they thought they could totally suspend habeas corpus too, just throw people in Guantanamo and deny them an attorney. It didn\u2019t work out that way. That\u2019s the thing about government agencies recently: They think they can ignore civil rights in the name of safety. But the Bill of Rights isn\u2019t as irrelevent as they\u2019d like to believe. Plus, it gets worse. At the time of Berlin, the Sokovia Accords weren\u2019t US law yet.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut they had already been signed,\u201d Wilson argued.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBy Secretary Ross,\u201d Foggy corrected. \u201cBut that\u2019s not how laws are made in America. They have to be passed by both the House and the Senate, and then they have to be signed into law by the President -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c- which they were, after Germany -\u201d Matt added.\n\u00a0\n\u201c- but not at the time of the airport fight. It doesn\u2019t matter how powerful you are in the government; if it hasn\u2019t been passed by Congress and the President, it\u2019s not a law.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe same thing happened with the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations, post World War I,\u201d Karen explained. \u201cPresident Wilson signed the Treaty, but it never made it into US law, because he couldn\u2019t come to an agreement with Congress over the League.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy nodded. \u201cWhich means at the time of the fight, you weren\u2019t bound by the Accords yet. So the UN basically sent a paramilitary team after US citizens and illegally held them without representation. And then locked them on a prison submarine.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason prison ships aren\u2019t in use,\u201d Matt inserted. \u201cThe British used them during the Revolutionary War, and thousands of people died. Locking you into small cells with no visitation, no recreation time, and no way to get in touch with an attorney is not only cruel and unusual punishment, but it violates numerous civil rights.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Foggy nodded. \u201cNot only that, but the fact that it violated so many civil rights means that it\u2019s ineligible for US law. Eventually, it would have gone to the Supreme Court, but the Times Square Incident happened first. In America, there are checks and balances in the government for a reason. Since Fundamental Rights were involved, the Accords would have gone under the Strict Scrutiny Test, which pretty much guarantees that they would have been overturned. So, basically, the only way you wouldn\u2019t get a trial would be if they decided not to press charges.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhich they\u2019re going to want if they have half a brain,\u201d Matt muttered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor one thing, they wouldn\u2019t come out clean if they pursued this. Illegal imprisonment, sending Stark after them before they had the legal backing to do so, not even reading Miranda - it\u2019s a mess, and one they don\u2019t want to dredge up. That gives us leverage. Besides, even without all that, it sets too big of a precedent. They can\u2019t prosecute him for the attack on the Accords, because it\u2019s already been established that that was Zemo. So all they\u2019ve got is the Winter Soldier assassinations, and they won\u2019t want to go near that with a ten foot pole. There was a reason the DA fled from the Kilgrave case, and it wasn\u2019t just because Hogarth showed up: If they win a case that prosecutes someone that was under mind control, they\u2019ve left the rest of America vulnerable, including themselves. All they would need was another Kilgrave or Hydra to walk into their offices, and they\u2019d be held responsible for actions that weren\u2019t theirs. And, since the SHIELD data drop, it\u2019s public knowledge that the Winter Soldier was being controlled. We\u2019re hoping that once we make this clear, they\u2019ll drop the case.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d Foggy proclaimed, slapping Hello Kitty band aids onto Peter\u2019s hands, \u201cyou\u2019re done. Be gentle to my poor copy machine.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter rolled his eyes as he left the conference room, walking over to the partially dismantled behemoth. \u201cYour poor copy machine hasn\u2019t worked properly since the 80s,\u201d he called.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFalse! It has been in perfect working condition as recently as 1991!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Peter yelled back childishly. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you over the sound of me installing your new panic room!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHold still.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cStop it, just please - no! Please, Skip, just stop!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cStop what, Einstein? We're not really doing anything: it's just a little experiment.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI - I want my pants back now.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut the experiment's not done yet, genius. And aren't you always prattling on about how important it is to finish an experiment? How it could make the results unreliable if you didn't do it properly?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s - that's different.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, it's not. This is just another experiment, and I need you to finish it correctly.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAren't we friends, Einstein?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI - I don't -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c Aren't we?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cI - I guess so.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, don't friends help each other? Didn't I help you with you with your science experiment when you needed an outside party?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, yeah, but -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen shouldn't you return the favor? I helped you with your experiment, now you have to help me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy experiment didn't hurt  you !\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat? Of course it didn't. And my experiment hasn't hurt you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut you -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI've always been careful, haven't I? Aren't I always gentle with you, Einstein? You've never been injured, have you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, not exactly, but-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut  nothing.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cIt feels wrong, though! Doing these things feels wrong, and I don't want to do them anymore!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you don't have to. If you feel uncomfortable, you don't have to do  anything to help me with the experiment.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally, Skip? Thanks, I -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can do it; you just have to lay there. Someone as smart as you, you can get  that much right.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cW-what?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe experiment still has to be completed, Einstein, you know that. But if you don't want to do anything, you don't have to.  I can do it, but you need to be still while I perform all the trials.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut - but you  just said -\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cYou're not participating in anything by being still while I finish. Stop complaining, Einstein; I\u2019m doing you a favor. After all, laying there isn't doing anything, is it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI guess not, but -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen stop being such a spaz about it. The sooner you stop yammering, the sooner we can get going again. Come on, it's time to start the next test.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI just don't think -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cPeter.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\u201c...okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c Finally . Now, turn around and lay face down on the bed. And stop shaking, Einstein, there's nothing to be worried about. I'll be gentle, I promise.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe  Daily Bugle released an article.\n\u00a0\nAbout Spider-Man. And about Spider-Man\u2019s rape.\n\u00a0\nPeter really should have seen this coming.\n\u00a0\nAfter all, he had  worked  for the  Bugle,  before he started getting money from the September Foundation  ; he knew how much Jameson hated Spider-Man. He had realized that they were being far too silent about the whole thing, but he had been too grateful to care about why.\n\u00a0\nNow, he knew. They weren\u2019t silent; they were just preparing.\n\u00a0\nThe article never outright said that Spider-Man deserved to be raped - that would be too inflammatory, even for the  Bugle. Instead, they claimed that it hadn\u2019t been rape at all.\n\u00a0\nIf Spider-Man was underage at the time it happened, any sexual endeavour he had would have been considered Statutory Rape - which wasn\u2019t real rape, according to the  Bugle.  Spider-Man had  obviously  been very loose as a teenager, the article claimed - his skin-tight Spider-Man costume was referenced, along with the rumors that he was intimately involved with Daredevil - and he must have \u201censnared\u201d an older man or woman, and let them take the fall for his  willing participation. Now, he was just painting himself as a victim to elicit sympathy.\n\u00a0\nWhen the article first broke, Peter had gotten so sick that he couldn\u2019t go to school. It was as if the  Bugle had taken all his fears and blared them across the front page. May had found him with his head in the toilet, retching up everything in his stomach had to offer. At first, she had been puzzled, until she found the newspaper Peter had crumpled into a ball.\n\u00a0\nMay lit the paper on fire, called Peter in sick, and spent the entire day forcing Peter to watch cheesy 50\u2019s horror movies with her instead of holed up in his room.\n\u00a0\nEven when she didn\u2019t know the whole story, she still knew how to make him feel better.\n\u00a0\nAnd, with that one little article, the  Daily Bugle escalated something that was only of interest in New York and parts of the United States to an international debate.\n\u00a0\nThis wasn\u2019t about Spider-Man\u2019s past, not anymore. No, now it was about rape culture and blaming the victim. Now, Spider-Man\u2019s past was an example to be held up by both sides of the argument.\n\u00a0\nWhat was once a public interest piece had become a crucial point that was determining how society as a whole thought about rape.\n\u00a0\nIt became a movement, one that held Spider-Man up as their banner. People gave speeches; they organized rallies. #ForSpidey trended. One t-shirt design popped up and spread across the country overnight. It had Spider-Man\u2019s iconic symbol in the center, with the words I am not a victim - I am a survivor sprawled across the front, and the words True Hero on the back. Peter wasn\u2019t sure who first made it, but it was everywhere - in his school, on the street, even in his home. When he first saw Aunt May wearing one, Peter cried, and couldn\u2019t tell her why.\n\u00a0\nHe thinks she understood anyway, even though she didn\u2019t know the extent of it.\n\u00a0\nBut there was also the other side of the argument - the ones that agreed with the  Bugle. \n\u00a0\nPeople made  jokes.  About Spider-Man, and about what happened to him. One Twitter comment escalated into an overnight scandal, when somebody said that they \u201cfeel for\u201d Spider-Man\u2019s rapist - that\u2019d they\u2019d \u201cdo whatever it took to tap a bod like that\u201d too. There were those that thought that Spider-Man had just gotten involved with someone while still below the age of consent, and therefore it wasn\u2019t \u201creal rape.\u201d There were those that sympathized with Skip, despite the fact that the knew  nothing about the situation.  There were those that called Spider-Man a liar, a slut, and an attention seeker, because  boys weren\u2019t raped. There were those that said it didn\u2019t matter.\n\u00a0\nAnd then Tony Stark bought the  Daily Bugle. \n\u00a0\nIt hadn\u2019t been that surprising, all things considered. After the article, their stock had plummeted as people boycotted their paper for \u201cperpetuating rape culture\u201d - the exact words of  CNN , who ran a special report over the incident. There were protesters that had camped outside of the building the same morning that the article first broke, and hadn\u2019t left since. Stark probably got it for a song. The surprising thing was what he did when he had it.\n\u00a0\nHe held a press conference to announce the sale. A joint press conference, to be exact.  With Steve Rogers. \n\u00a0\n Everyone knew that the two had a falling out, though no one knew for sure why. They hadn\u2019t spoken since whatever happened in Siberia, and rumor had it that the two would never cooperate again.\n\u00a0\nAnd then they did. On live TV. While wearing matching t-shirts. Which just so happened to be the True Hero Spider-Man shirts.\n\u00a0\nThe message couldn\u2019t have been clearer: If we are working together on this, it\u2019s important, so shut up and agree with us.\n\u00a0\nTony Stark didn\u2019t crack a single joke throughout the entire conference. Instead, he proclaimed that Jameson had been removed from his job as Editor-in-Chief, that they had hired some \u00a0Political Scientist - someone named Darcy Lewis - to fill the position until they found someone who could hold it permanently, and said that he was taking the  Bugle  in a whole new direction. He said that they were done with the sensationalized, fictionalized stories that the  Bugle  was known for. From now on, there would only be  real  news based on real facts, and that no \u201cvindictive, disgusting piece of shit passing as news\u201d would get onto the papers under his watch.\n\u00a0\nEveryone knew which article he was talking about. No one mentioned it.\n\u00a0\nAnd then it was Captain America\u2019s turn.\n\u00a0\nHe was much more to the point. He gave a brief, impassioned speech about the need for justice, and about how justice was impeded if \u201ccertain individuals\u201d of society refused to see the crime for what it was. He admonished the people making light of the situation, and stated that \u201crape is a horrific, disgusting crime that should not be trivialized.\u201d Then, he spoke about what it was like when he was a kid, about how rape went largely unreported because the victims would be shamed by society just as much - and in some cases more - than the perpetrator. He went on to say that when he woke up, he was so thankful that that aspect of the public view had changed, and how ashamed he was of his country, after seeing how they had proven him wrong.\n\u00a0\nAnd, well, it was  Captain America  saying it. Even after the fiasco with the Accords, he was still seen as a paragon of virtue. People had grown up hearing stories about the man that stood for Truth, Justice, and the American Way, and to hear him say that they had made him ashamed to be an American? Well, it fostered guilt like nothing else. #Sorryspidey trended in under ten minutes.  Hundreds  of videos of people - crying, ashamed people - apologizing for what they said flooded social media.\n\u00a0\nAnd thus was the power of Captain America\u2019s Disappointed Face(TM).\n\u00a0\nBy the end of the conference, everyone knew where Captain America and Iron Man stood on the topic, and it was with Spider-Man.\n\u00a0\nPeter trusted his aunt and uncle.\n\u00a0\nBut that didn\u2019t mean he could tell them  anything. \n\u00a0\nA constant problem in Peter\u2019s life: Not many people understand him.\n\u00a0\nThat can be interpreted in two ways. The obvious interpretation was that Peter said a lot of things that you\u2019d need a science degree to understand, which was very true. Granted, May and Ben didn\u2019t understand them in those instances either, but they didn\u2019t have to. It never stopped them from listening to Peter as he jabbered about whatever new thing had caught his interest.\n\u00a0\nBut there was also the fact that people didn\u2019t  understand him.\n\u00a0\nPeter was a strange boy. Whereas most boys his age liked comic book superheroes, Peter liked scientists from the Age of Enlightenment. Whereas most boys had race car quilts and Power Ranger posters, Peter had pictures of Isaac Newton and Michael Faraday and a bedspread with astronomically accurate constellations on it. By all accounts, Peter was different.\n\u00a0\nAnd Aunt May and Uncle Ben were the only ones that truly accepted that.\n\u00a0\nWhen Peter babbled about chemistry, they smiled at him. When Peter read  The Origin of the Species for fun, they asked him what it was about, and listened as he described it in a far-too comprehensive understanding for someone so young.\n\u00a0\nHis peers bullied him for those same reasons. His teachers avoided him, for the simple reason they didn\u2019t know what to  do with him. And, for a moment, Peter had thought that he had finally found someone accepting in Skip, but that had proven disastrous. All he had left was his aunt and uncle.\n\u00a0\nAnd Peter  couldn\u2019t risk that. \n\u00a0\nThe fear that telling would destroy the only blessedly accepting relationship Peter had had stayed his hand. What if that easy acceptance was gone the moment that they found out? What if he lost the only bright spot he had left?\n\u00a0\nPeter was scared.\n\u00a0\nAnd so he kept silent.\n\u00a0\nPeter was finding that every vigilante/superhero had a specialty. A type of criminal they always ended up being the one to deal with. It may not be the  only type of criminal they fought, and maybe occasionally their Big Bad would battle it out with another super, but at the end of the day, without fail, it was their problem to deal with.\n\u00a0\nCaptain America fought Nazis and/or cult groups.\n\u00a0\nIron Man outsmarted the biggest and baddest mad scientists, and blew up terrorist organizations.\n\u00a0\nDaredevil made Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u2019s organized crime pee themselves.\n\u00a0\nPeter got anything and everything that crawled out of the sewer.\n\u00a0\nSeriously. The  sewer. \n\u00a0\nPeople who thought this job was glamorous were idiots.\n\u00a0\nAs it was, Peter had already dealt with three attacks from the whatever-it-was-this-time that was wreaking havoc in the waste - literally - of society, and he had protocols to deal with it, now that the police actually liked him. Protocols. He would take down whatever thing was crawling around before, web them, and then call the special offshoot of animal control that had been created for exactly this occasion to pick up the creatures. Unless they were sentient. When that happened, he had a whole new number to call.\n\u00a0\nThis was Peter\u2019s life now.\n\u00a0\nPeter dodged the tail, then the claws, then the tail again. The sewer monster(s) of the week were three weird crocodile-lizard things, twice Peter\u2019s size, with claws sharper than daggers.\n\u00a0\nStrangely enough, this was the most relaxed Peter had been in weeks.\n\u00a0\nUppercut. Right hook. Roundhouse. Dodge. Cell phone.\n\u00a0\nCell phone?\n\u00a0\nInstinctively, Peter yanked his burner off his belt and flipped it open, ducking a swing of an armored, scaly tail as he went.\n\u00a0\nIf ever was there proof that he was a member of the teenage race, it was this.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSpider-Man?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKick flip. Left. Duck. \u201cHey Daredevil!\u201d  Jump. Jab. Backhand.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you busy?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBack flip. Springboard kick. Jab. Irritated roar from Lizard-Croc #2. \u201cLittle bit!\u201d \n\u00a0\nWebs. More webs. Even more webs. How were these things breaking his webs? Side step. Oh God, what did he just step into? He hated the sewers. Claws. Damn, those things were sharp. Webs to his own arm, to stop the bleeding. Dodge.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt's important,\u201d Matt replied tersely.\n\u00a0\nDuck. Punch. Fighting one handed was a bad idea, Peter was discovering. Feet knocked out by tail. Roll out of the way. Try not to think about what you're rolling in. Get back up.\n\u00a0\n\u201c I'm gonna have to put you on speaker!\u201d Peter decided.\n\u00a0\nTail. Claws. Tail again. Teeth - that was new. Lizard-Croc #1 was branching out, apparently.\n\u00a0\nPeter jabbed the speaker button on his phone before webbing it to the ceiling, allowing it to dangle from a thin thread.  \u201cWhat's up?\u201d  he shouted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter shot two streams of webs to the ceiling, jerking himself up and into a flip, and landed on Lizard-Croc #3\u2019s back. He shot one stream of webbing to his opposite hand, then wrapped the thin cord around the monster\u2019s neck, using it as a garrote. \u201cIt's important?\u201d he prompted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight -  oh no, sweetheart, don't worry, everything's fine -\u201d he said faintly.\n\u00a0\nDid the Devil of Hell\u2019s Kitchen just call someone  sweetheart? \n\u00a0\nPlease let it not be him. Please God, don't let Matt be talking to him.\n\u00a0\n \u201cIs someone else there?\u201d Peter hollered.\n\u00a0\nBut Matt wasn't even using his Batman voice. He always used his Batman voice around other people.\n\u00a0\nWhen Matt replied, it was in his normal, even tones, instead of the deep falsetto reserved for vigilantism and freaking out Foggy. \u201cThree kids came into Hell\u2019s Kitchen tonight, calling for me. Said they needed to get in touch with Spider-Man.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLizard-Croc #3 collapsed due to oxygen deprivation,  finally. Peter flipped off the collapsing figure, landing squarely on his feet between the two remaining aggressors.\n\u00a0\nWell, crap.\n\u00a0\nKick. Punch. Dodge. Dodge. Duck. Kick. Jab.  \u201cCan they take a message?\u201d Peter screamed.\n\u00a0\nMatt sighed. \u201cGimme a second.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOne of the tails wrapped around Peter\u2019s throat, hoisting him off his feet. \u201cTake your time,\u201d Peter rasped. He kicked forward, slamming his feet firmly in the center of the hybrid\u2019s chest. The whatever-it-was released Peter and staggered back, eventually falling and slamming its head into the wall. It didn't get up again. Peter turned to face his last opponent.\n\u00a0\nMatt\u2019s voice returned, presumably after he had walked away from his impromptu guests, this time soft but  enraged  . \u201cThey smell like adults, Peter. In a way no kid ever should. It's in their skin and their breath and  everywhere. They say they'll only talk to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n(Once, Peter had asked Matt what made him start Daredevil. He had asked what had been so terrible that Matt had risked everything to fix it.\n\u00a0\nMatt had gone very still, looked out over his city with sightless eyes, and answered in a too-calm voice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHer name was Chloe. She was nine years old, had a dog named Turtle, and liked to sing  You are My Sunshine. And every night before her father came in her room to rape her, she prayed to God to send an angel to save her.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThen, he smiled, something grim and humorless and full of promise. \u201cI got tired of waiting for God.\u201d)\n\u00a0\nIt must be  killing Matt to not be able to help with this.\n\u00a0\nPeter leaped, yanking his fist back and slamming it into the skull of the beast. Staggering beneath the blow, it fell backwards. Peter didn't waste time; he grabbed the head of the Lizard-Croc, and rammed it into the wall. It didn't get up again.\n\u00a0\nPeter paused for a minute, his chest heaving. He was covered in sweat, grime, and God only knew what else. He had bruises and cuts scattered over his body that he should probably see to before they got infected by all this muck.\n\u00a0\nPeter walked over to the phone, plucked it from its thread, and raised it to his ear. \u201cI'll be right there,\u201d he promised.\n\u00a0\nIn the end, it was the shower that revealed everything.\n\u00a0\nIt wasn't the way Peter flinched every time someone came near him. It wasn't the nightmares, which had come every time Peter closed his eyes. It wasn't even the way he would sometimes start to cry, and couldn't stop again.\n\u00a0\nInstead, it was his long, hot showers, that had became progressively longer and hotter by the day.\n\u00a0\nApparently, things like that drove the water bill through the roof, to the point where it was very noticeable to the person paying said bill.\n\u00a0\nMay and Ben had seated him on the couch, and had only just begun to explain why they couldn't afford something like this, when Peter realized it.\n\u00a0\nIt was never going to end.\n\u00a0\nSkip was never going to stop. There would be no unknown variable, no new factor that Peter could put into this equation and have it equal the end of this. He was about to lose the only thing that made him feel somewhat clean anymore, but the dirt would keep piling higher and higher. There was only one way to stop this.\n\u00a0\nAnd so Peter closed his eyes, drew his knees to his chest, and spoke.\n\u00a0\nPeter took a flying leap into the harbor before he went to the abandoned warehouse Matt and the kids were waiting in. Granted, it wasn't exactly a proper shower, but at least it washed off  some of the grime from the sewers. Web slinging helped too; nothing dried you off quicker than flying through the air at high speed.\n\u00a0\nSilently, Peter slipped through a shattered window, and into the large, open, filthy building. Three kids were there: two boys and a girl. The girl was young, maybe nine, with dark red hair that curled at the ends. She was seated not far from the boys, one that seemed to be around twelve, the other no more than five. The older boy had dark brown hair and a split lip, and he was holding the younger boy, a blonde-headed child with red-rimmed eyes and a body that wouldn't stop shaking. Matt was still with them, crouched down a safe distance away from the two boys, whispering something Peter couldn't make out to the smaller one.\n\u00a0\nPeter flipped down, landing gently on his feet. For a moment, the children started and froze, merely staring at him.\n\u00a0\nAnd then the little girl scrambled to her feet, ran over to the lanky figure, threw her arms around him, and began to cry.\n\u00a0\nPeter stilled. The little red-headed girl buried her head in Peter\u2019s chest, and cried harder.\n\u00a0\nCarefully, Peter wrapped his arms around the small form, rocking her gently. The girl  sobbed, horrible, heart-wrenching things that sent tentative roots of grief out, twisting and scrambling until they found purchase in Peter\u2019s heart.\n\u00a0\nThen, eventually, she calmed. She sniffled and wiped her nose, before looking up at Peter with so much  hope, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna save us, right, Spider-Man?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Peter  swore  that he would.\n\u00a0\nThe girl\u2019s name was Marissa. She was, in fact, eight years old, and she had ran away from home that very day. The reason? For the past three years, her father had been making her take off her clothes before he molested her, and when she finally told her mother, her father said she was lying and her mother believed him.\n\u00a0\nMarissa left within the hour.\n\u00a0\nThrough some twist of fate, she ran into the two boys, who had been on the streets for the past three days, and hashed out the plan to find Spider-Man together.\n\u00a0\nThe boys\u2019 tale wasn\u2019t any better.\n\u00a0\nSam was twelve, his younger brother Jim was five years old, and Sam loved Jim more than life itself. Their father had been a Marine who was killed in action, and their mother remarried a man named Frank two years ago, only to die in a car accident six months previously.\n\u00a0\nAnd Sam had no idea what Frank was doing to Jim until three days ago, when he walked in on the deed itself.\n\u00a0\nSam tried to kill Frank; Frank almost killed Sam.\n\u00a0\nSam took Jim and  ran. \n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you go to the police?\u201d Matt asked, cocking his head.\n\u00a0\nSam shot the vigilante a dirty look. \u201cFrank  is the police. He\u2019s a detective in the Bronx, and he\u2019s got a lot of friends. I took Jimmy there first, but ran when I overheard one of them calling Frank.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhich left Sam three days later, out of options but with his head still lifted defiantely against the world, giving one last desperate attempt at saving his baby brother.\n\u00a0\nThat attempt being trusting  Spider-Man. \n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s been in quite a few critical situations since he became Spider-Man. He\u2019s fought mad scientists and terrorists alike; he\u2019s held the fate of the city in his hands. He\u2019s been the difference between life and death.\n\u00a0\nBut somehow, all of that seems ridiculously trivial in comparison to right now.\n\u00a0\nMatt and Peter discuss their options in front of the children; they had considered walking away, but decided against it after seeing the look on Sam\u2019s face. They had been through too much to take away their choice now. When the decision was made regarding what to do next, it would be with their agreement.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe need to talk to  some police officer,\u201d Peter argued. \u201cThey have authority where we don\u2019t, and they can make sure you guys can get to a hospital.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s too risky,\u201d Sam warned, shaking his head. He pulled Jim closer to his body, and the little blonde boy buried his head in his brother\u2019s neck. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that they can be trusted not to go to Frank.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Matt said. \u201cI know a good cop, one that can\u2019t be bribed. He could help.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was a hesitation there, though. They all knew what it meant: Matt wasn\u2019t sure if he could send them to a male cop without them panicking. Despite seeking Daredevil out themselves, it was clear that the only reason the children had bothered with him was because of his connection with Spider-Man, coupled with the ease of locating him. After all, all you had to do to find Daredevil was walk into Hell\u2019s Kitchen and yell the man\u2019s name, before waiting to see if he would show up. And Daredevil would  definitely  follow the calls of three little kids alone in Hell\u2019s Kitchen at  night, if for no other reason to ensure that they made it home safely.\n\u00a0\nBut that didn\u2019t change the fact that they were  terrified of the man.\n\u00a0\nSurprisingly, it was Marissa that spoke up. \u201cWill Spider-Man be there?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter glanced up. \u201cOf course,\u201d he vowed.\n\u00a0\nShe nodded with a sense of finality. \u201cThen we can go see the good cop. Spider-Man will make sure nothing bad happens.\u201d Then, she slipped her hand into Peter\u2019s, and clung to it like it was the only thing between her and Bedlam.\n\u00a0\nAnd something inside Peter  broke. \n\u00a0\n(Another thing inside him was fixed.)\n\u00a0\nWhen they finally settled into a plan of action that everyone was comfortable with, the kids set about getting themselves ready. Marissa retrieved a backpack obviously meant for school in the corner, bursting at the seams from its contents; Sam sat Jim down and began to prepare, whispering to his brother gently with soothing promises and soft smiles.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you coming with us?\u201d Peter asked Matt.\n\u00a0\nMatt waited a moment before shaking his head. \u201cThey don\u2019t trust me, don\u2019t feel safe around me. They need you. Besides,\u201d he said, the Devil creeping into his voice, \u201cI have a few stops to make tonight.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen they left, Jim peaked over his brother\u2019s shoulder, glanced at Matt shyly, before whispering, \u201cBye, Mr. Daredevil.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt smiled at him, soft and gentle with none of the Devil in it. \u201cGoodbye, Jimmy.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd then he was gone, leaping up trash cans and fire escapes to the rooftops with barely a sound.\n\u00a0\nPeter got the feeling that Daredevil would be sighted in the Bronx tonight.\n\u00a0\n(Peter wasn\u2019t sure if he believed in God. He had vague memories of crosses hung on walls and church services with droning Latin before his parents died, at which point they ended for Peter entirely. He didn\u2019t know much about religion - any religion - and he certainly didn\u2019t have faith like Matt had.\n\u00a0\nBut he did know that some religions, like the Catholic religion, believed that there was bigger plan for everything. That sometimes, bad things -  terrible things -  happened  , but had the potential to do good later.\n\u00a0\nLike a little boy who saved a man only to lose his sight, and went on to use the senses granted to him in return to save a little girl crying out to God.\n\u00a0\nA thought never voiced aloud: Peter\u2019s not sure if he believes in Matt\u2019s God. But if Matt  is  right, and there  is a bigger plan to all this, then Peter thinks that Daredevil was never waiting for God.\n\u00a0\nBecause God had answered that girl\u2019s prayer over a decade before it was uttered, when a little boy lost his sight.)\n\u00a0\nBy the time Peter finished, his aunt and uncle were crying.\n\u00a0\nLooking back, that always would be the part that he remembered clearest: The two people he loved most in the world, with tears dripping down their faces.\n\u00a0\nIt was enough to make Peter pause. To make him wonder if he should have kept quiet, if he should have spared them from the truth.\n\u00a0\nWhen his aunt tried to hug him, Peter flinched, and when she slowly drew back, it felt like he had broken something irreparably.\n\u00a0\nHe didn't think she was mad at him. He didn't think she was upset with him.\n\u00a0\nBut he did know that nothing could ever be the same between them.\n\u00a0\nOnce hung, the Sword of Damocles could never be taken down again, not without cutting the string and allowing more damage to be done. It would always be there, waiting.\n\u00a0\nThere were just some things you couldn't come back from.\n\u00a0\nPeter was grateful when they allowed him to go upstairs again.\n\u00a0\nOn a level, he knew that it was only because they wanted to discuss him without him hearing, figure out how to manage this new world they had been thrust into. At first, he had had a brief flare of anger. He had already lost too much control over his own life; he deserved to be included in any decisions.\n\u00a0\n(May lifted a trembling hand to his face, hovered briefly above the skin, stopped, and drew back without making contact.\n\u00a0\nPeter went upstairs.)\n\u00a0\nHe stopped at the top of the landing, just out of sight, however.\n\u00a0\nPeter sat on the last step, curled up into a defensive ball, and listened.\n\u00a0\n\u201c-need to figure out what to do next.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBen\u2019s voice, usually so strong and confident, was shaking.\n\u00a0\nMay\u2019s visage, barely in sight, gained a flinty expression. Her jaw tightened. \u201cI know  exactly what to do next.\u201d\n\u00a0\n(Her voice didn't shake.)\n\u00a0\nThen, she walked out of sight, her enraged footsteps receding down the basement steps.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMay? May, what are you doing?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen she came back up, there was a tire iron in her hand.\n\u00a0\nBen stepped in her path. \u201cMay,\u201d he began carefully. \u201cStop.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer hand on the tire iron tightened. \u201cGet out of my way, Ben.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe need to think about what\u2019s best for Peter right now.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s best for Peter?\u201d she snapped, tears dripping down her face. \u201cWhat's best for Peter is making sure that - that -  monster  never touches him again! No, actually - no it\u2019s not. What  would have been  best for Peter was making sure it  never happened in the first place. But it's too late for that, isn't it?\u201d she snarled, shoving past her husband.\n\u00a0\nBen caught her wrist.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet go of me, Ben!\u201d May snapped. She slapped him, slamming her fists against his chest and arms. She cried harder.\n\u00a0\nBen held her tighter.\n\u00a0\n\u201c Let go of me! Let go let go let -\u201d \n\u00a0\nThey collapsed in a heap on the ground, the tire iron falling with a clatter.\n\u00a0\n \u201cHow could we let this happen?\u201d  May sobbed.  \u201cHow did we not see?\u201d \n\u00a0\nThe Hell\u2019s Kitchen Police Department had seen better times. As of now, it was understaffed, overworked, and under budgeted. Its new recruits were already jaded, and its veteran officers even more so. The members watched their remaining coworkers with the type of wariness that only came with being stabbed in the back, and then turning around to discover seventy percent of your precinct holding the knife. They suffered through the long hours with bad coffee and a gun on their hip, sheathed in a holster with the thumb break snaps always a little bit lower than they would have otherwise been.\n\u00a0\nBy the time Spider-Man walked through the door with three too-young children, no one was surprised.\n\u00a0\nSaddened, yes, but never surprised.\n\u00a0\nPeter had never really gotten used to being inside police stations. Before the Times Square Incident, the police preferred to shoot at him, and Peter preferred to not get shot. As a result, Peter preferred to ninja-slap the more persistent ones, and the more persistent ones preferred not to get ninja-slapped. Mutual avoidance had really been the only answer.\n\u00a0\nAfter the Times Square Incident, they had come to a tentative understanding. The Defenders wanted to protect New York. NYPD wanted to protect New York. New York was best served when the people who were protecting it were actually  protecting it, rather than getting into a sissy-slap-fight with one another (*cough* Avengers *cough*). Therefore, they had to all suck it up and get along, because God knew the superheroes were taking their sweet time removing their heads from their asses.\n\u00a0\nTen points to vigilantism and police work, then.\n\u00a0\nHowever, despite this agreement, Peter had only been in a police station as Spider-Man once, and when that happened, half the precinct tip-toed around him, the other was divided between the hero-worshipers and the Jameson 2.0s, and he spent the entire time trying to pretend that his voice hadn\u2019t just broken less than a year ago. The entire experience had been a stressful mess, and Peter had vowed to avoid a repeat at all costs.\n\u00a0\nBut at the time, he hadn\u2019t been holding the hand of a little redheaded girl with a shake in her grip and trust in her eyes. He hadn\u2019t been standing next to a boy with too much hard-won pride to hold Spider-Man\u2019s hand, but who still stood ever-so-slightly closer to the man (teenager) he was trusting everything his brother everything with.\n\u00a0\nSome prices were worth paying.\n\u00a0\nThe woman at the front desk had tangled brown hair, weary brown eyes, and a grim demeanor that only came with seeing too much in too short of a time.\n\u00a0\n(Matt had had that look once. So had Peter. So had Jessica, and Luke, and so many others of the people Peter was collecting like shards of broken sea glass. That look never went away.\n\u00a0\nYou just learned how to hide it.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a Detective Mahoney.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe woman stared at him, then looked at the children, a tired acceptance in her eyes. She nodded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMahoney!\u201d she hollered, jerking her head to the side. \u201cGot a cape here for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAt the other end of the worn station there was a room with its door propped against the stained wall, completely ripped off its hinges. When Peter looked inside, he saw a pitiful break room consisting of a single coffee maker, a foldout table with no chairs, and an empty cardboard box serving as a trash can.\n\u00a0\nThe dark-skinned officer hovering over a chipped coffee mug started, spilling a brown streak down his front. Swearing, he walked forward, his eyes down on his formerly-white shirt. \u201cWhy would Daredevil  ever -\u201d The man looked up. The words died on his lips.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m a friend of Daredevil,\u201d Peter offered. \u201cHe said you\u2019re trustworthy.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBrett Mahoney\u2019s eyes fell from Spider-Man to Marissa, from Marissa to Sam and Jim. He had an all-too-familiar grim look on his face.\n\u00a0\nPeter raised his chin and tightened his grip and  dared Mahoney to turn them away.\n\u00a0\nSlowly, Mahoney nodded.\n\u00a0\n(Sometimes, you see too much in too short of a time. Sometimes, you are a seven year old who thought you had a friend, only to find a predator. Sometimes, you are nine and blinded, ten and an orphan, twelve and abandoned. Sometimes, you try to help, and end up getting hurt. Sometimes, you are a hero and a victor and a victim and defeated . \n\u00a0\nSometimes, life happens, and the proof of it becomes etched on your face.\n\u00a0\nSometimes, it gets worse, and the proof disappears.\n\u00a0\nBecause by then, you\u2019ve learned that the world never likes to be reminded of its failures. They like the ones that smile even as they scream, the ones who don\u2019t prove just how cruel life can be. You hide festering wounds with meaningless promises and worthless platitudes, and you laugh through the pain.\n\u00a0\nBecause by then, you\u2019ve got practice.\n\u00a0\nSometimes, the tragedies get deeper and darker, and your protections get stronger and higher. You are constantly besieged by hate and pain and grief, and you learn how to keep fighting even when you want to fall.\n\u00a0\nAnd then, sometimes, it gets better.\n\u00a0\nYou find a tiny pearl of goodness in the swine of humanity. You find the shred of kindness that you had been begging for but never  once expected to receive. You find a woman that will risk her career and license to patch up a bunch of strangers, a priest that will offer a cup of coffee no matter your faith, a police officer that will butt heads with every damn one of his coworkers to help a group of kids he had never met before.\n\u00a0\nAnd for one moment, you are completely and utterly  dumbstruck that this kind of thoughtless generosity still exists.\n\u00a0\nAnd for that one moment, all your defenses crumble, as useless as Jericho. Because you had built walls to keep out the slings and arrows, but hadn\u2019t prepared for the doves. Your carefully crafted facade disappears.\n\u00a0\nWhenever that happened, Peter was very glad he wore a mask.)\n\u00a0\nThey drove to the police station, walked up to the front desk, and told the attendant on duty that they needed to report a rape.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHi, there,\u201d the nurse said, gazing softly at the five year old. \u201cMy name\u2019s Claire. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJim,\u201d the boy declared shyly, a thumb firmly lodged in his mouth.\n\u00a0\nThe Latina smiled gently, and there was pain in her eyes. \u201cWell, Jim, I'm gonna take a look at where it hurts. Is that alright?\u201d\n\u00a0\nJim paused, shrinking closer to his brother. Sam held the boy tighter, muttering reassurances he didn\u2019t truly believe.\n\u00a0\nPeter remembered this part too.\n\u00a0\nThe group hadn\u2019t been at the police station long when the decision was made to take them to the nearest hospital. For obvious reasons, the kids needed medical attention - and they all refused to go without Peter.\n\u00a0\nPeter had sat in the back of the police car, Marissa cocooned into his side and Jim clenching his hand, and he hadn\u2019t felt so powerless since Skip.\n\u00a0\nBecause he was Spider-Man. Because he  had  power. Because he was strong and fast and  trusted - trusted to make the right decision, trusted to defeat the villain, trusted to make sure everyone made it out alright.\n\u00a0\nBecause he didn\u2019t know if he could win this fight.\n\u00a0\nIt was easy, fighting in the streets. Peter could end fights with a flick of his wrist; he could stop speeding cars simply by digging in his heels. He would come home battered and bloodied and bruised, but in the end, it was really only him getting hurt.\n\u00a0\nNow, he was responsible for a bunch of kids that were so much like him but still so different that it  ached  , kids that could end up going back to  their  Skips if he screwed this up. Peter had only felt this kind of choking, suffocating fear a few times in his life - when his uncle was groaning and gasping below him, and when Skip was groaning and gasping  above  him, for two very different reasons but both absolutely  terrifying. \n\u00a0\nAnd then Marissa would offer him a tremulous smile, or Jim would thoughtlessly, unhesitatingly rest his head on Peter\u2019s shoulder, or Sam would look at Peter with a barely-trembling jaw that betrayed just how  scared he was, and Peter would ignore his fears.\n\u00a0\nFear didn\u2019t matter anyway. All that mattered was how you dealt with it.\n\u00a0\nThe hospital brought back unwelcome memories.\n\u00a0\nPeter had gone there after Skip, obviously. There had been tests and questions and  more tests, and the police had wanted every scrap of evidence they could scrounge up.\n\u00a0\n(Skip had babysat the same morning that Peter went to the police. When they realized just how much  evidence there was, May got sick, and Ben had to leave the room.)\n\u00a0\nPeter held Marissa\u2019s hand as Claire began to ready the rape kits, and he wondered if this was how May had felt all those years ago.\n\u00a0\nWhat happened next was a blur.\n\u00a0\nThere were doctors and police officers and social workers who spoke in soft, simpering voices that made Sam snap and Marissa cry out of sheer  frustration. There were tests and evidence gathering and even more police, once the media figured out that Spider-Man was acting the protector to three kids and began harassing the hospital. Eventually, there was Peter attempting to intimidate people with the sheer force of his Spider-Manness.\n\u00a0\nIt ended the way they always knew it would, but never wanted to admit.\n\u00a0\nSam had figured it out from the start, and refused to have any illusions about it. Somehow, Peter found the fact that the boy had already outgrown hopeful impossibilities incredibly depressing, despite having done so himself at an earlier age than Sam.\n\u00a0\nIn the end, Spider-Man could not stay.\n\u00a0\nHe was masked, and fifteen besides, and could not act as guardian to three traumatized kids.There were CPS workers already making arrangements and officers that were barely tolerating Peter\u2019s presence, and the best Peter could do was cajole the social workers into a promise to keep the kids together.\n\u00a0\nThen, he had to let them go.\n\u00a0\nMarissa and Jim cried. Sam didn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHere,\u201d Peter choked out, pressing a crumpled piece of paper into Sam\u2019s hand. \u201cI want you to memorize that number. All of you. If anything happens, call me. I\u2019ll come.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSlowly, Sam nodded, and Peter thought he saw a little bit of hope growing in the boy\u2019s eyes.\n\u00a0\nPeter left. He couldn\u2019t look back.\n\u00a0\nMay and Ben held Peter\u2019s hand the entire time.\n\u00a0\nWhen he finally stopped web-slinging, he ended up on a tall, windy rooftop, and couldn\u2019t remember how he got there. Very, very slowly, Peter sat down on the ledge, and looked out over the city. Before him was a blend of winking lights and buildings brighter than stars, and for some reason, Peter felt simultaneously lighter and heavier than he had in a long time.\n\u00a0\nIt was the phone that snapped him back to life.\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t the burner, which, while signifying something was wrong with the other vigilantes, would have at least offered him some means of distraction. Instead, it was his normal, Peter Parker iPhone, which could only mean one thing.\n\u00a0\nMay.\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t want to answer. He did anyway.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter swallowed past the lump in his throat. \u201cHey, May.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou were supposed to leave the office hours ago.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHoping to get home before worrying May, Peter had started his afternoon patrol at six o\u2019clock. Now, it was 2:37am, and Peter had missed thirty-seven of May\u2019s calls.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, yeah, sorry,\u201d Peter muttered, looking down. \u201cWe got caught up researching for a case, and we lost track of time. I - I meant to call, I was just\u2026 busy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBusy?\u201d May deadpanned. \u201cYou were busy for  eight and a half hours?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, May. I really, really am.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this internship is such a good idea,\u201d May sighed. \u201cIt seemed okay at the time, but you\u2019ve got so much school work and the grant and everything\u2026 You\u2019re spreading yourself too thin, Peter. And an internship at a firm that will keep a fifteen year old this late is not good for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNelson and Murdock is fine,\u201d Peter cut in. \u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s complicated. Can we talk about it later? Please?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright,\u201d May slowly acquiesced. \u201cLater. We will be discussing this, Peter. I don\u2019t want you walking home so late; take a cab and I\u2019ll pay for it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter hesitated slightly, staring out over the landscape of lights. He couldn\u2019t go back, not yet. Not like this. \u201cMatt said I could stay the night at his place when he realized the time. He didn\u2019t want me heading back alone so late.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time they had pulled the \u201cmy totally trustworthy, blind boss offered me his couch for the night\u201d stint, and it probably wouldn\u2019t be the last. May had met Matt, Foggy, and Karen not long after she agreed to Peter\u2019s internship, and she adored the group - after running extensive, possibly illegal background checks on all of them. She trusted them enough to watch out for Peter, and that fact had helped cover up his nightly activities more than once.\n\u00a0\nThis time, May hesitated.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d she asked cautiously. \u201cYou've been acting - off - lately.\u201d A pause. \u201cIf something's happening - if - if someone\u2019s hurting you again -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Peter cut her off harshly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou've been having nightmares, Peter,\u201d she pressed. \u201cYou think I don't hear them, but I do. And you've been coming home hurt, and you've been spending so much time at the firm, and you've been avoiding Stark completely - and - and I don't give a shit if they're blind or a lawyer or goddamn  Iron Man,  if someone\u2019s hurting you, I'll stop it. I - I  promise, Peter,\u201d she finished, her voice breaking.\n\u00a0\nPeter clenched the phone in his grip, squeezing his eyes shut tight. \u201cNo one\u2019s hurting me,\u201d he answered softly. \u201cThat - that never happened. Not again. Everything's fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA pause.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know you can tell me anything, right Peter?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n I\u2019m Spider-Man. I have been since Ben died, and it was never meant to go this far, but it spun out of control and now I can't remember how to be anything else. \n\n\u00a0\nOr:\n\u00a0\n No. No, I can't. Because I did once, years ago, and maybe it was the right thing to do but it wasn't  easy,  and something broke in your eyes that day and never fixed again. And I can't do that again; I'm too scared about what will break this time. \n\u00a0\nOr:\n\u00a0\n\n I helped three kids tonight. They were like me, but not really. They trusted me, and I felt seven years old all over again. I was there for them, like you were for me, and I never realized how badly that must have hurt you until now. \n\n\u00a0\nOr:\n\u00a0\n\n I'm sorry. \n\n\u00a0\nOr:\n\u00a0\n\n Thank you. \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d Peter lied.\n\u00a0\nWhen the police interview began, Peter asked May and Ben to leave the room.\n\u00a0\n(He trusted them more than anyone else in the world. He loved them so much that it hurt.\n\u00a0\nWhich is why Peter never, ever wanted them to hear what he was about to say.)\n\u00a0\nThere were only two officers - a soft spoken blonde lady with thick glasses and a look that screamed \u2018psychologist,\u2019 and a dark haired woman with bruises under her eyes and a hard set to her jaw - a notepad and pencil, and a small, boxy tape recorder left in the room. The only ones left to play witness to what Peter was about to say.\n\u00a0\nHe knew how this went. He had researched it long ago.\n\u00a0\nAlready, Peter had given statements to numerous officers, had listed names and accusations and touched that stupid doll the same way Skip had touched him. Already, he felt sick and vulnerable and  violated. \n\u00a0\nThey weren't done yet. Peter knew this.\n\u00a0\nIt was protocol. There were questions, specialized questions, designed to make sure that Peter hadn't been coached. To make sure everything he said was true. There would be inquires and interrogations and stupid, prying  questions  , all to make sure that what Peter said happened  had happened.\n\u00a0\nPeter wanted it to end. More than anything else, he wanted to be done with the entire thing. And while he couldn't finish it - he didn't think it would ever be over, not really - he could speed up the process.\n\u00a0\nBefore either woman could say anything, Peter opened his mouth. \u201cWho\u2019s going to hear this tape?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe dark haired woman looked at him evenly. \u201cIt will be cataloged as evidence, only available to those with clearance. It may be a part of future legal proceedings, but it won't be public.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I won't have to meet the people that hear it?\u201d Peter pressed. \u201cAt least not for long? No one I know will listen to it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA strange look entered the woman\u2019s eyes. \u201cThat's right.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot even my aunt and uncle?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot even them.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA fact: Memory formation is enhanced when a person is afraid. The brain triggers the adrenal gland, which releases adrenaline, which is involved in the creation of memories. Eventually, the brain becomes absolutely  drenched  in adrenaline, and every sound, sight, taste, and feeling becomes etched in the person\u2019s mind - it's why PTSD occurs.\n\u00a0\nAnother fact: Peter had an excellent memory.\n\u00a0\nA result: Peter remembered every touch, every movement, every  second of Skip.\n\u00a0\nSlowly, Peter nodded, and began to describe in graphic detail actions that no seven year old should ever know about.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs this Spider-Man\u2019s number?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter raised his eyebrow, plopping down on a billboard ledge. Before he had even made it out of his neighborhood, his burner had rang, a hesitant, familiar voice on the other end.\n\u00a0\nHis patrols had become systematically later and more broken up, May\u2019s concern for him driving Peter to all new levels of secrecy. She was worried, and when she was worried she hovered, and a hovering aunt was never conducive to a vigilante lifestyle. Peter had to get creative.\n\u00a0\n(Sometimes, Peter thought about telling her everything, about confessing it all and hoping for the best. Sometimes, he opened his mouth, and lingered with the words on the tip of his tongue.\n\u00a0\nThen, he remembered the other time that he had let difficult words fall, and stopped himself.\n\u00a0\nPeter didn't regret telling Aunt May about Skip. If he could do it over again, he'd make the exact same decision.\n\u00a0\nBut Peter doesn't want to be saved, not from this, not from Spider-Man, and telling her for the sake of telling her risks hurting her without a chance of being able to fix it. And that terrifies Peter more than any criminal ever did.\n\u00a0\nHe closes his mouth. Always, always he closes his mouth.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is Steve. Steve Rogers? Captain America, that is. Daredevil gave me your burner number, said to call for emergencies.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCaptain America was calling him.\n\u00a0\nCaptain. America.\n\u00a0\nWhich, yeah, Peter had met him, sassed him, punched him, but  this was different.  This was Truth, Justice, and the American Way personally calling up puny Parker for help. For  vigilante  help. Which Peter could actually  provide. \n\u00a0\nBe cool, Parker. Be cool.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs this an emergency?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA pause. \u201cThere's a little girl wandering the streets here in Brooklyn, looking for me. She's got nothing but her pjs and a teddy bear, and - and she's pretty beat up. She says she'll only talk to Spider-Man.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter swallowed, his heart kicking up a notch. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd so it began.\n\u00a0\nThree kids Peter stumbled upon while patrolling Queens. A little boy running around Hell\u2019s Kitchen, yelling for Daredevil. A steady stream of people fleeing abusive relationships and family members into Alias Investigations. A few youngsters stumbling around Brooklyn, and a couple teenagers who found their way to Harlem.\n\u00a0\nEven a couple kids that walked into Stark Tower and asked to see Spider-Man.\n\u00a0\n(That call had been the first Peter had received from Stark Industries since he left that day. He almost didn't answer it.\n\u00a0\nPepper was on the other end.\n\u00a0\nBy the time Peter reached Stark Tower, Tony had already called the police, corralled the scared kids into his lab, and was regaling them with dramatic stories and controlled - for once - explosions. When the children ran from his presentation to crowd around Spider-Man, Stark briefly met Peter\u2019s eyes over their heads, offered him a weak smile, and then looked away.\n\u00a0\nThey didn\u2019t speak the entire night.)\n\u00a0\n (Don\u2019t worry about Tony,  Steve(!) had texted him once.  He\u2019s never been much of one for privacy. And things like this, it\u2019s just how he shows he cares. He always tries to fix other people\u2019s problems any way he can, and sometimes he oversteps his boundaries. \n\u00a0\nAnd:  He wants to talk to you, if you\u2019ll let him. \n\u00a0\nPeter hasn\u2019t replied to those. Not yet.)\n\u00a0\nAt first, the people only wanted Peter. Slowly, however, they began to trust the others.\n\u00a0\nCaptain America made the news by carrying a little boy into a hospital for a rape kit. Tony Stark was a constant, hovering presence at the NYPD, micromanaging the investigations of the children that came to him with all the flare of an eccentric billionaire. Daredevil\u2019s YouTube channel - which was, to Peter\u2019s endless amusement, called The Devil\u2019s Mistress - noted a marked increase in the sexual predators the man battled, and guest star Brett Mahoney, while looking infinitely done with his life, commented on the surplus of both criminals and children who came to him because \u201cDaredevil said so.\u201d\n\u00a0\n(Peter sent Mahoney a fruit basket, and signed it  Daredevil . He made sure it was delivered to the precinct when he, Matt, Foggy, and Karen were there for a case.\n\u00a0\nMatt glared in his general direction. Foggy gave him a subtle high-five. Karen graced him with a smile, then glared at Matt for glaring at Peter, her gaze employing that special type of badassery that could penetrate blindness.)\n\u00a0\nJessica Jones harangued police officers into helping the people she found, threatened the CPS officers into finding the underage ones good homes, then tracked down Peter, reeking of booze and exhaustion.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said candidly, carefully picking a piece of pineapple off her pizza before flicking it off the fire escape, \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that we are heroes.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd it sucks.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cVillainy probably would have paid better,\u201d Peter mused, chomping down on his slice thoughtfully.\n\u00a0\nShe laughed, low and bitter. \u201cThey look up to us. Why the Hell do they look up to us?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2026 have no clue.  I don't even look up to us.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJessica leaned against the metal framework, closing her eyes as she took a swig from a flask. \u201cI used to think he was there,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the time. I'd be doing something - stupid, everyday stuff - and then he'd be there. And I'd be so,  so convinced it was real. I still do, sometimes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat doesn't change all that much,\u201d Peter admitted, settling next to her. \u201cHasn't for me, at least. Gets easier, sometimes. I can go days, weeks, even months, and I'm fine. And then he\u2019s there again. Like nothing's changed.\u201d Peter licked his lips. \u201cI don't feel like a hero.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, me neither, kid.\u201d Jessica looked out over the landscape, taking another long, slow swig from her flask. Her nose crinkled. \u201cGod, are we actually having a heart to heart? When did we become girls?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAround the second trimester for you. I've got irrefutable proof that I'm not. And that's an unfair stereotype, Jones.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJessica rolled her eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKevin Thompson,\u201d she eventually said, her eyes still glued to the horizon. \u201cDidn't find out his real name for a long time. He was always Kilgrave to me. Kilgrave was\u2026 Kilgrave. Kevin was just a messed up kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNeither of them spoke.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteven Westcott,\u201d Peter eventually said. \u201cWent by Skip. I was seven.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJessica looked at him askance. \u201cShit, kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter shrugged. \u201cMessed me up pretty badly for a while. But I didn't become a Kilgrave. And neither did you. We can't blame everything on our pasts. At some point, we all make a conscious decision to be a certain way, and - and we've got to be  greater  than what we suffer. Kevin and Skip made their choices, and we made ours. And no crappy history is going to change the consequences of that choice.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPoetic,\u201d Jessica mumbled thoughtfully. Then, \u201cYou're a good kid, Spidey.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA pause. \u201cPeter.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA smile, barely there. \u201cYou're a good kid, Peter.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter hadn't wanted to go to the hospital.\n\u00a0\nHospitals were for injuries. They were for those horribly hurt, the ones that needed the doctors and the bandages and the  help. And Peter\u2026 Peter just wanted it all to stop.\n\u00a0\nBut May\u2019s eyes were still red and Ben looked like he had aged ten years in ten minutes, and Peter couldn't bear to fight the issue.\n\u00a0\nA kindly officer had promised to take them there in his cruiser, a nervous smile planted on his face as he made the offer.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt'll be fun,\u201d the man had promised with a hesitant look full of fake cheer. \u201cYou can try out the sirens, if you want.\u201d\n\u00a0\n(Peter didn't want to, and he told the officer that with no small measure of pleasure.\n\u00a0\nThere was a certain exhilaration, he thought, when people listened to what you wanted.)\n\u00a0\nThey were walking through the front of the precinct when it happened.\n\u00a0\nThe doors opened, and Skip walked through, hands handcuffed behind him and an officer on each side.\n\u00a0\nAnd Peter stopped, and looked.\n\u00a0\nOn a level, he had known that officers had left to arrest Skip while he was still there - on a level. It had never been  conceivable  that he would have actually  seen Skip here.\n\u00a0\nBased on the looks on their faces, it hadn't been conceivable to May or Ben either.\n\u00a0\nThe officer before him flushed bright red, already muttering apologies and excuses. He began to turn towards the three of them, trying to shepherd them out of the corridor, when Peter flinched away.\n\u00a0\nIt didn't take long for Skip to notice them.\n\u00a0\nThis time, Peter didn't flinch. He lifted his chin and squared his jaw and  forced himself to remain still.\n\u00a0\nSkip stared back. Then, very slowly, he nodded cordially, and moved on. Through the station, between the swinging doors, and out of sight.\n\u00a0\nOut of his life.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan't you at least go easy on him?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe's Captain America; I seriously doubt he needs me to go easy on him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou wouldn't have to go  full Devil on him,\u201d Peter tried. \u201cMaybe half. Three quarters?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt hummed noncommittally. Which meant no.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe shamed the Internet for me! That has to get him  some brownie points.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt smiled reasonably. \u201cOf course it does.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you won't try to break both his legs?\u201d Peter pressed, relaxing slightly.\n\u00a0\nMatt snorted. \u201cIt doesn't get him ten tons worth of brownie points.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter groaned before flopping backwards dramatically, turning the force of his Petulant Teenager to eleven.\n\u00a0\nMatt glanced at him, completely unsympathetic. \u201cHe\u2019ll heal.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy pride won't,\u201d Peter grumbled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou still have pride?\u201d Matt cocked his head curiously. \u201cI thought the last of that was destroyed when you were taken out by that poodle.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat thing was vicious!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight, of course,\u201d Matt agreed, nodding amiably. \u201cThat vicious poodle. Named Sugarplum.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAsshole.\n\u00a0\nPeter narrowed his eyes. \u201cTread carefully, Daredevil,\u201d he warned. \u201cI have just as much blackmail on you as you have on me. Tell anyone, and it's mutually assured destruction.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm aware. Just like I'm aware that you can't use any of your knowledge to stop  me  without exposing yourself.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don't have to beat up Captain America!\u201d\n\u00a0\nShrugging, Matt went back to strapping his thick, Melvin-approved, people-smashin\u2019 Devil GlovesTM back on. \u201cYes, I do. I promised Foggy and Karen I would. Sort of.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThursday Vigilante Smack Down was not, in fact, every Thursday. They  tried to have it every Thursday - if only for the sake of Foggy, Karen, Trish, and the rest of their assorted loved ones who preferred them beating the crap out of each other rather than ninja-slapping armed criminals and hoping for the best, and got a little peace of mind from the knowledge that they would all be together - but, practically speaking, it was impossible. If anyone figured out that all of New York\u2019s (effective) vigilantes disappeared every Thursday, then criminals would come out in droves once a week. Besides, conflicting schedules made finding an actual date unbearable. If Jones was free, then Peter would be stuck studying for a Mandarin test. If Peter could make it, Matt would be spending the night destroying an arms trading ring.\n\u00a0\nReally, the only reason they were meeting tonight was due to the fact that Karen and Foggy got tired of Matt\u2019s passive-aggressive quips and Steve\u2019s eternal guiltiness, and forced Steve to swear on his Shiny Shield of Patriotism and Matt to swear on his Devil Horns of Badassness that they would finally go beat the crap out of each other, so they could rejoin the League of Adults, thank you very much.\n\u00a0\nPeter didn't swear on anything, but he was forced to attend nonetheless.\n\u00a0\n(Despite attending, he apparently was not qualified for joining the League of Adults, either. Apparently, he had \u201cto be at least this old to ride the ride.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter felt this was discrimination, and was planning his lawsuit accordingly.\n\u00a0\nFoggy said that was cute and called him a handsome duck before giving him a lollipop and telling him to run along now, little child.\n\u00a0\nMatt smirked.\n\u00a0\nKaren informed him that it only got worse the longer he hung out with them.\n\u00a0\nPeter hated them all.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cTechnically, you only promised them you would start acting like an adult again. You and the Captain both. That can be achievable without bodily harm. How about a contract renegotiation?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt snorted. \u201cKeep trying, councilor. We\u2019ll make a lawyer out of you yet.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSquawking, Peter sat up, offended. \u201cSlander! I am a scientist! This is the deliberate defamation of my - oh forget it; I have been hanging out with you too long.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Matt decided, standing up smoothly. \u201cThe Captain said he would be late; he had something to take care of in Brooklyn. Want to spar until then?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter flipped to his feet.\n\u00a0\nMatt fought as he always fought: without holding back.\n\u00a0\nWhen he had first been taught to fight, Matt had been taught to never restrain himself, and it had been a habit that he had never been able to fully break. While he never killed, he didn't exactly show mercy, either. He just\u2026 fought. Like a warrior. Like an animal.\n\u00a0\nLike a devil.\n\u00a0\nHe was teaching Peter to fight like that, too.\n\u00a0\nA result: Peter got hit a lot.\n\u00a0\nPeter found this fact to be strangely satisfying.\n\u00a0\nThat was not to say, however, that he  enjoyed  getting beat up. It was not to say that he liked it  when  Matt didn't hold back.\n\u00a0\nIt was simply that he liked the fact that Matt  didn't  hold back.\n\u00a0\nThis was a small but important distinction.\n\u00a0\nWhen people found out his age, they tended to pander to him - especially during sparring. This fact frustrated Peter to no end.\n\u00a0\nAfter all, it wasn't like the super villains were about to hold back during a fight. He needed to know how to handle himself in the real world, and for that, he needed his teachers to actually  teach him, not skirt around him as if he were a clumsy puppy beneath their feet.\n\u00a0\nMatt was more than happy to oblige.\n\u00a0\nAnd, as a result, Peter was actually  learning. \n\u00a0\nThrough pain. And bruises. And more pain.\n\u00a0\nBut now he could backwards springboard kick flip a guy in the face, which was  awesome, and more than enough of an incentive for showing up to the somewhat brutal lessons.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Peter said, and he meant it.\n\u00a0\nMatt paused, wiping sweat from his brow. \u201cFor what?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor\u2026. duct taping me to a fire escape. And for everything that came after.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHesitating, Matt turned his sightless eyes in Peter\u2019s direction. The dark red lenses of the Daredevil mask winked in the dull light. \u201cYou know you can come to me, right? About anything. Whether about everything that\u2019s been going on lately or -\u201d he waved a hand ineffectually in the air \u201c-anything. I\u2019ll help.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Matt,\u201d Peter replied, somewhat stiltedly. \u201cI\u2019m - I\u2019m good. Really.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd here was the thing: Peter  was good. For the most part, he felt that he had moved past the whole \u201cSkip\u201d thing. It hadn\u2019t gone away - wouldn\u2019t go away, not ever, not that - but Peter had grown around it, scar tissue holding together what once had been a wound. Peter wasn\u2019t flinching at every touch; he didn\u2019t bear the same blanket distrust for everyone the way he once had. Most of the quirks Peter had developed during that part of this life, the little tokens Skip had inadvertently nurtured with each subsequent visit, had - not disappeared, but melded into the rest of Peter. They had grown with him, until their patchwork pattern almost blended in with the whole of his psych, only visible if Peter let you close enough to see the stitching.\n\u00a0\nThere were just some things that still stuck with him, immutable despite the passed time. A few little quirks that still popped up every now and then, a sharp contrast against the balance he had obtained. Unpleasant things, but manageable.\n\u00a0\n(Once, Matt was trying to teach Peter a new grappling move, designed to flip your opponent just right, and his hand slipped a little too high on Peter\u2019s thigh.\n\u00a0\nPeter threw Matt through a wall, then spent the next half-hour hyperventilating.\n\u00a0\nFor the following three weeks, Peter alternated between apologizing profusely and refusing to explain why.)\n\u00a0\n(Cherry made Peter sick.\n\u00a0\nIt has not always been this way.\n\u00a0\nOnce, it had been Peter\u2019s favorite flavor. Anything cherry, he would eat. Cherry lollipops, cherry gum, even cherry cough syrup.\n\u00a0\nCherry popsicles.\n\u00a0\nExcept then Skip babysat him for the third time, and Peter had spent the entire day leading up to it panicking uncontrollably. Surprisingly enough, Skip hadn't touched him the entire time - hadn't even  looked  at him funny - and that was supposed to mean that Peter was  safe,  damn it. But then Skip offered him a cherry popsicle, his favorite, and Peter had sucked the entire God forsaken thing into his mouth before he noticed Skip watching him with that  nowronguncomfortable   stop  look on his face. He had tried to stop, tried to back away from the land mine he had unknowingly stumbled upon, but Skip made him finish every last bit of it. He watched the entire time.\n\u00a0\nThen, Skip was taking the red-stained stick from his hands and forcing Peter to his knees with a rough shove. And Peter hadn't  understood,  hadn't even  guessed at what was going on as the older boy pried open his cherry-stained mouth, but he began to get an inkling when Skip shoved his pants open. Peter had tried to turn his head, but Skip had just buried his fingers in Peter\u2019s hair and jerked him back into position before -\n\u00a0\nCherry made Peter sick.)\n\u00a0\nMatt nodded. \u201cI know. But if you ever aren\u2019t\u2026 well, I\u2019ve been made intimately aware of how important friends can be in our kind of lifestyle.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt\u2026 Matt wasn\u2019t offering pity. He was offering friendship.\n\u00a0\nAnd that was all Peter really wanted.\n\u00a0\nWhen the Captain showed up, Peter outright groaned.\n\u00a0\nSteve paused momentarily, his eyes flickering between Matt and Peter. \u201cEverything alright?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Peter stated mulishly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCaptain,\u201d Matt greeted, smiling tightly. \u201cStep into the ring.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait!\u201d Peter cried. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot you, Matt. You don\u2019t count.\u201d\n\n\u201cI find that to be categorically untrue.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour face is categorically untrue.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Peter,\u201d Steve cut in. \u201cThis is fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d Peter groaned. \u201cIf you both are committed to beating each other up, you have to know The Rules.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe rules?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe. Rules,\u201d Peter stated soberly. \u201cThe Sacred Rules of Vigilante Fight Club, passed down to us by the Mighty Overlords Karen and Foggy, signed into law by the Good Taskmasters Trish and Malcolm, enforced by the All-Powerful Hands of Claire the Inescapable-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonder that anyone has ever confused him to be over fifteen,\u201d Matt murmured thoughtfully. \u201cI often think he\u2019s younger, just from the way he acts.\u201d Steve nodded his agreement.\n\u00a0\nPeter glared at them both. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose either of you would like to be the one to tell the others that The Rules were ignored?\u201d Both of them blanched. \u201cDidn\u2019t think so. Karen made me  memorize  this so I could recite it verbatim; you all are lucky you only have to hear it when we get a new member; I hear it in my  sleep. Rule One: No maiming. Rule Two: Those with super strength may only hit their opponents with force proportional to the endurance said opponent possesses. Rule Three: No, Matt, your sheer Catholic will does not count as super-endurance. Rule Four: Jessica, who is not currently here because of something called \u2018actual work,\u2019 is not allowed bring beverages of high alcohol content to the fights, as there is something known as an \u2018impressionable teenager\u2019 attending. Rule Five: Dumpsters are not to be used during any fights, either as a weapon or a place to throw our vanquished opponents. Rule Six: Peter, while webs may be your weapon of choice, they are a nightmare to get out of Matt\u2019s armor, so if you don\u2019t start avoiding the joints on that thing so help me God I will -\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Rule list kind of degenerated from there. Privately, Peter suspected Karen was drunk when she typed it up, but had decided he valued his life more than his desire to ask.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAny questions? Comments? Last Will and Testaments?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBoth shook their head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright let's get this over wit - wait!\u201d Peter scrambled through the pockets of his sweats, searching. \u201cI almost forgot!\u201d Tapping a button on his phone, Peter closed his eyes as a satisfying  ddddooooonnnngggg erupted from the app whose sole purpose was to replicate a gong. It may or may not have cost him $1.29 to download.\n\u00a0\nWorth it.\n\u00a0\nPeter opened his eyes again. Both Matt and the Captain stared at him. He paused. \u201cThe gong meant go.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSlowly, Matt shook his head, then punched the human embodiment of Truth, Justice, the American Way - and likely eagles to boot - in the throat.\n\u00a0\nIt really went downhill from there, but not in the way one might think. Because soon, it became abundantly clear that Steve was only fighting with the left half of his body.\n\u00a0\nSeriously. He didn't even pick up his other leg to  move; he just left both right limbs hang numbly at his side, limp and pathetic.\n\u00a0\nThis fact only enraged Matt further. \u201cAre you,\u201d he spat, \u201cgoing  easy on me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nGoing easy on Matt was a dangerous thing to do. It was far too reminiscent of the ableist assholes who were the reason that Matt now visited the gym after closing hours, and was liable to get oneself punched in a place no man wished to be punched.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Steve promised, wide-eyed and trustworthy, America pre-Internet personified. \u201cI would never do that; you're more than capable of holding your own. And you're right to be mad at me for what happened at the airport; I'm mad at myself. Peter was obviously very young and untrained - not that you didn't fight impressively well, Peter, because you did. But that lack of training can be like you\u2019re missing limbs during a fight. And instead of recognizing that as a sign of how very young you were, I exploited that, and endangered your life in the process. So if you had to fight me missing limbs, Peter,\u201d Steve finished, nodding at his right side, \u201cthen it's only fair I do the same with Daredevil.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHesitating, Matt tilted his head for a moment, considering the Captain\u2019s words. Then, he dropped his fists and stalked out of the ring, muttering under his breath. A true angelic-chorus, God-intervening-from-above miracle.\n\u00a0\nIt was an incredibly good thing that Matt was blind, because if he wasn't he would have been able to see the slight quirk to the Captain\u2019s lips, and the too-cunning gleam in his eyes.\n\u00a0\nSuddenly, Peter remembered that a) Matt was handling Steve\u2019s best friend\u2019s case, b) lawyer-client relations may have been somewhat impeded if they beat the crap out of one another, and c) not only was the Captain known for throwing a shiny object at Nazi\u2019s heads, but also for his military genius.\n\u00a0\nSon of a  bitch. \n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, the Capsicle\u2019s always that annoying.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter spun around.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, kid,\u201d Tony Stark greeted, somewhat awkwardly. \u201cGot the invite. This Superhero Fight Club, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cVigilante,\u201d Peter spluttered. \u201cNot superhero.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh,\u201d Stark nodded. \u201cI heard you guys were kinda touchy about that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI - uh - who gave you the invitation?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter looked at the Captain.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDaredevil said he had a standing invitation. So I gave it to him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt turned his head towards Steve. \u201cI approve of you, now,\u201d he solemnly informed him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut it, Horns.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLook, kid. Peter,\u201d Stark amended, raising his hands defensively. \u201cI\u2019m not here to step on your toes. If you want me to go,\u201d he promised, sucking in a painful breath, \u201cI\u2019ll go. But I\u2019d like to talk to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter clenched his fists.\n\u00a0\nIf he was being honest, he wasn\u2019t mad at Mr. Stark - not anymore, at least. That emotion had faded fast; he had too many reasons to hate nowadays, anyway.\n\u00a0\nThe other emotions had remained. Namely, the fact that Peter was  embarrassed. \n\u00a0\nStark had read the accounts; he knew things that Peter hadn\u2019t wanted  anyone  to know. It made Peter feel exposed, being around him, all the while knowing that  he knew. \n\u00a0\nPeter took a deep breath. He centered himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he heard himself say. \u201cYou can stay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSlowly, Mr. Stark nodded. \u201cIf we\u2019re being honest, I didn\u2019t come here to let the Dominatrix over there beat me up,\u201d he admitted, glancing towards Matt. \u201cHey there, Horns, love the fashion statement, have you considered adding a whip to the ensemble? Maybe a few chains? I think it\u2019d really tie the whole theme together.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt took a step forward.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m kidding! What, they have no jokes in the Inferno? Lighten up, Lucy.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man was going to get himself killed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are you here then, Mr. Stark?\u201d Peter interrupted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFirst, I\u2019d like to -  apologize,\u201d  Stark bit out, the words sounding awkward on his tongue. \u201cFor invading your privacy. And disregarding your wishes. And -  everything. Can we\u2026 Would you\u2026 Forgive and forget?\u201d he settled on.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Forgive,\u201d Peter decided eventually. Not forget. He didn\u2019t forget.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...There\u2019s something else.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you know that for some reason the entire city thinks I\u2019m your personal secretary?\u201d the billionaire probed suddenly. \u201cGet seen dramatically flying side by side  once, and everyone calls you when they want to talk to a giant spider. Really, Webs, I should be getting paid for my services, because -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe point, Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter reminded him.\n\u00a0\nTony rambled when he was nervous. That\u2026 that was worrisome in this setting.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat? Oh, right. Well, the City Council called me. They have this new program they're planning on implementing in the police department. It's a response to all the media heat they've been getting lately - a better training, improved funding, greater awareness type thing. They\u2019re having some kind of ceremony to announce it, and they were hoping for a superhero endorsement.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd by that you mean a  Spider-Man endorsement,\u201d Matt interrupted, his voice cold, sharp steel against the timbre of Tony\u2019s voice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can't,\u201d Peter blurted instantly.\n\u00a0\nThis fact had nothing to do with Skip. It had nothing to do with his memories. It had nothing to do with his fears.\n\u00a0\nIt had everything to do with the people who looked up to Spider-Man.\n\u00a0\nThey had given him something, these people. They had given him their  trust. It felt precious, this fragile, starving thing, like something that would wilt with a breath of air.\n\u00a0\nBut it was also strong.\n\u00a0\nIt was enduring. They believed in him, had put their faith in him. For some reason, they were completely and utterly  convinced  that Peter couldn't -  wouldn't - lead them astray.\n\u00a0\nIt was an important distinction, Peter thought.\n\u00a0\nCouldn't means something is impossible. It means the scenario isn't even an option, because there is an overarching law of the universe preventing it from being so.  Couldn't  doesn't mean  anything,  because you  couldn't  know what would happen if that  couldn't  becomes a  could. \n\u00a0\n(And people already  could do many things.)\n\u00a0\nWouldn't is different.\n\u00a0\n Wouldn't  is a choice. It is the knowledge that something is an option, and it is the conscious decision not to do it. To say someone  wouldn't do something is handing someone a knife and knowing that they could stab you in the back with it, but trusting them not to.\n\u00a0\n(It's handing someone a knife and exposing your back to them, blood still weeping from where you trusted wrong before.)\n\u00a0\nIt's a special difference, this one letter distinction - \u00a0an honor, really, and one that Peter  wouldn't betray.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is about you, Peter,\u201d Stark pressed. \u201cIt's happening because of what happened to you. And while you and the vigilante squad are doing good work out there, it's not practical. You guys still have other crimes to fight; you can't monitor one type forever. And you can't give them all the help they need! If these people are going to get the resources they need, they have to go to the police for that, and they're not going to do that unless  you tell them it's safe.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat if it's  not?\u201d Peter interrupted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot what?\u201d\n\u00a0\n \u201cSafe!\u201d  Peter exploded. \u201cWhat if they end up back in the same crappy situation as before - because they followed  my  advice? What if the program doesn't work, and the training fails, and I  can't help them?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cWe have to make it work, Pete,\u201d Mr. Stark warned. \u201cWe have to make sure this program works. It has a lot of potential to help people, wasted potential. What you're doing now is good, but its unsustainable. We have a golden opportunity to fix things now; we need to take it. We may never get another chance like this.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter sucked in a deep breath and clenched his fists.\n\u00a0\nBecause  Stark was right. \n\u00a0\nWhat he was doing wouldn't work in the long run. It would get those that came to him out of their situation, granted, and help them go to the police, but it wouldn't help the dozens of other people Peter  couldn't help. It wouldn\u2019t help those that couldn\u2019t find him, or those that were too scared to venture out in the streets to look - and rightfully so. Danger was not uncommon in New York City after dark; seeking him out had its own risks.\n\u00a0\nThe police were more accessible. They were easily found, and had round-the-clock hours. Furthermore, they were there for a  reason. \n\u00a0\nTo help the same people Peter wanted to help.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want to see the program before I commit to anything,\u201d Peter eventually stated. \u201cI need to know what they\u2019re planning before I endorse them.\u201d\n\u00a0\nStark didn\u2019t even blink. \u201cDone.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd - it\u2019s a public appearance they want?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNone of them missed the hint of reluctance in his voice.\n\u00a0\nPeter wasn\u2019t exactly the type of celebrity that did interviews and and engaged the press; his was of the more grainy photographs and shaky videos uploaded to YouTube variety. It risked too much, what with him being an underaged masked vigilante who had multiple bounties put on his head by various criminal organizations while being on uncertain ground with the law and all. Anything that jeopardized his anonymity was not worth it. And since the reveal, his instinctive avoidance of the press corps had only grown.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like they can pinky swear you\u2019re cool with it,\u201d Stark joked hesitantly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be unbearable, though,\u201d Steve jumped in.\n\u00a0\nPeter turned to look at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know that voice. Does the Star Spangled Man have a Plan?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Captain rolled his eyes at Tony\u2019s antics. Then, he told them.\n\u00a0\nMr. Stark nodded thoughtfully. \u201cIt could work. I'd have to up the security on the place, but I was going to do that anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Peter protested. \u201cThe Avengers may be used to this kind of stuff, but waltzing around a rally in Central Park\u2019s not really a part of the vigilante lifestyle. I don\u2019t know if the Defender\u2019s would even show.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with it,\u201d Matt inserted.\n\u00a0\nPeter looked at him in surprise. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt nodded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut you\u2019re Daredevil; you only come out at night.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think I\u2019m qualified enough to decide what time of the day I can come out at.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeople can tell how stupid your suit looks in the daylight.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA tired sigh. \u201cWe all have our crosses to bear, Peter.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter could  hear him rolling his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you sure? I\u2019m pretty sure that suit is Fetish Red; there\u2019s absolutely no way you can hide that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cPeter.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, Daredevil,\u201d he smiled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you two going to hug? Because if you are, warn me beforehand. TMZ has put quite a price on a picture with any physical contact, and I didn\u2019t become a billionaire by missing opportunities.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan it, Stark.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNice decor you got here,\u201d Stark replied absently, glancing around. \u201cThe broken glass really ties it all together. And is this a blindfold?\u201d he questioned, holding up the thin strip of black that was tossed on top of their emergency pile of first-aid supplies and Twinkies (Jones\u2019s idea - super metabolisms could be a blessing and a curse). After he received a nod to the affirmative, the billionaire let out a low whistle. \u201cYou all have been holding out on me! Obviously, vigilantism is my calling. Have you all been getting up to things I would absolutely approve o -\u201d\n\u00a0\nStark stopped, then looked at Peter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m joking, obviously. I know you\u2019re not - and he\u2019s not -\u201d Stark gestured between Matt and Peter, fumbling out a hand gesture that wasn\u2019t exactly recognizable, but still likely illegal in at least four countries.\n\u00a0\nPeter rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Mr. Stark; you don\u2019t have to change your special brand of humor just because of what happened to me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh,\u201d Stark nodded. \u201cRight. So what\u2019s the blindfold for?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMe,\u201d Peter said, snatching it from his grasp. \u201cDaredevil\u2019s teaching me how to fight in a pitch black environment.\u201d\n\u00a0\nStark frowned. \u201cBut there\u2019s only one blindfold.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it kind of pointless to have a sightless fight when one of you can - holy shit.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter could see the wheels turning in the genius's mind; his stomach clenched. Matt tensed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Man Without Fear wasn\u2019t afraid - but he was wary.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not funneling your purchases through the blind guy; you are the blind guy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt totally makes sense: You\u2019ve been going after criminals you meet through your firm, you only work at night, and people say you can hit a target with those batons of yours without looking at them. You even got a Catholic-themed costume. The only question is how you\u2019re doing it\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt had glued his patent, you-are-a-moron-and-I\u2019m-going-to-tell-you-exactly-why smile on his face, usually reserved for prosecuting attorneys and idiots who thought the blind guy wasn\u2019t allowed outside without supervision. \u201cI think you\u2019re mistaken, Mr. Stark.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDude, I\u2019ve checked your Internet search history; no normal man goes through that much gauze and red leather patches without being a vigilante or having some weird preferences.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAccessing private purchases without a warrant is in direct violation of -\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt trailed off, realizing his mistake. Stark grinned triumphantly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHoly crap, I\u2019m right!  I didn\u2019t even think I was right; it was a shot in the dark, so to speak. So is it enhanced hearing or something else? Rumor has it that Daredevil can hear anyone in Hell\u2019s Kitchen - \u2018course, rumor also has it that you\u2019re Satan himself, so... \u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not blind,\u201d Matt lied, pinching the bridge of his nose.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d Stark nodded, unconvinced. \u201cAre the lenses of that mask even see-through?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course they are!\u201d\n\u00a0\nNo. No they were not. Peter knew, because he had tried them on once and promptly run into a wall, even with his enhanced vision. Which had led to an awkward conversation with Melvin, who had apparently figured it out day dot and decided that it meant he could use the strong but non-transparent glass, never letting Matt into this little fact.\n\u00a0\nOf course, this conversation had also led to Peter being introduced to Melvin, who was  awesome, and quite possibly Peter\u2019s new best friend.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Tony said, looking unconvinced. \u201cIn that case, what do those words painted on the wall say?\u201d he asked, pointing to the left side of the gym. \u201cAnd no asking the oversized Boy Scout for help. Or Peter.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Man Without Fear looked decidedly unafraid. Really.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI fail to see why I should have to prove anything to you, Stark.\u201d\n\u00a0\nYou don\u2019t,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201c\u2018Course, I\u2019ve never been the type to be careful about what I have to say around the press. I may just share with them the humorous anecdote about how I once thought that Daredevil was really mild-mannered attorney Matt Murdock, who was known to be in cahoots with said vigilante and buying quite a bit of sturdy material -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you honestly just say cahoots?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cQuiet, Peter, the adults are talking. And who knows, I may just  imply  at how I\u2019m learning so much  more about the man behind the mask, one layer at a time -\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt clenched his fists.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBreaking my face will not silence me!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s telling the truth,\u201d Rogers muttered mutinously.\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s estimation of the Captain rose a notch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere are no words,\u201d Matt guessed, a split-second decision rearing it\u2019s ugly head. \u201cYou\u2019re pointing at a blank wall.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cClose, but no dice. I am pointing, Batman, at the artistic rendering of a unicorn with an afro riding into the sun on a rainbow. Interesting adaptation, in my opinion; do you think the sunglasses on the sun refer to our denial of our own nature? Or is it that the joint the squirrel is smoking is a symbol of mankind\u2019s disregard of the environment? I feel this - graffiti? Graffito? Graffaitio? Do graffiti artists get their own name? - had a vision. Possibly a drug-induced one, but glass houses and all that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt tensed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon't you worry, Lucy; it's fine. Your secret is totally safe with me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm supposed to believe that?\u201d Matt spat.\n\u00a0\nStark held up his hands in defense. \u201cI  can keep a secret, you know; I just choose not to, in most cases.\u201d He paused. \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d he queried, curiosity bleeding into his tone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat's none of your affair.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, come on!\u201d Stark exclaimed. \u201cYou can't  not tell me! I'll figure it out!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou do that, then.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou should come to my labs. Peter, you should bring him to my labs.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'll make you tech,\u201d Stark bribed. \u201cThe best tech. That club could use an upgrade; a few tests, and I\u2019ll make you a new one.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI already upgraded his club,\u201d Peter protested.\n\u00a0\nHe and Melvin had been introduced. Bonding occurred. High-fives were had. Matt may or may not currently use a cane that splits into two billy clubs, one of which possessed a grappling hook.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere's always room for improvement,\u201d Mr. Stark waved off. \u201cCome on, Horns, what do you think?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt tilted his head. \u201cI think,\u201d he decided, an edge to his voice that made Peter\u2019s head snap up in wariness, \u201cthat you had a standing invitation here for a reason.\u201d Daredevil stepped back calmly, lifting up the tense rope around the mat. \u201cStep into the ring, Mr. Stark,\u201d he smiled.\n\u00a0\nSkip was gone.\n\u00a0\nHe was  gone. \n\u00a0\nThere was no reason to be scared anymore.\n\u00a0\nBut somehow, no matter how much he rationalized it, Peter couldn't seem to stop shaking.\n\u00a0\nPeter had always loved his bird\u2019s eye view.\n\u00a0\nContrary to popular belief, Spider-Man actually liked to see what he was getting into rather than rushing in blindly, webs flying. The heights that were afforded to him through his webs gave him that advantage, allowed him to carefully inspect the scene before he went in.\n\u00a0\nPeter could see the glare of the Captain's shield next to the red of Iron Man\u2019s suit, the tense form of Daredevil surrounded by gawkers glaring towards a laughing Jones. He could see others, too: Cage shifting through the onlookers and the swarms of press and the cops with gleaming badges against dark blue uniforms.\n\u00a0\nPeter turned around, went back the way he came, and then reentered Central Park ten minutes later from the street.\n\u00a0\nNo one had seen him come the first time. And now, dressed in civilian clothes, no one would see him return. Spider-Man  would appear eventually, of course - just not yet.\n\u00a0\nContrary to popular belief, the event was not about Spider-Man. It was about a seven year old boy named Peter, and Peter wanted to see it for himself.\n\u00a0\nJust this once, Spider-Man could wait.\n\u00a0\nThere were booths set up, with pamphlets and petitions and t-shirts for sale, and a large stage waiting for when the press conference began. There were milling groups and friends stumbling through the grass together and, sometimes, silent tears that were only noticeable for those that knew what to look for.\n\u00a0\nPeter found a tree, far from the mass of people, sat down, and watched.\n\u00a0\nFive minutes later, someone else came.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d the boy said, stuttering to a stop. Brown eyes peered nervously through fluttering eyelashes, and small hands wrung the corners of a shirt distractedly. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t think anybody would be over here.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe looked no younger than seven, no older than nine. And when he looked at Peter, Peter could see himself - not his whole self, but just bits, sprinkled in between someone else.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGreat minds think alike,\u201d he mused eventually. Peter nodded towards the other end of the large, wide tree. \u201cYou can sit, if you want.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t,\u201d the boy snapped warily. \u201cMy parents are waiting for me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt was difficult, Peter supposed, to lie to a liar. \u201cLet me guessed,\u201d he mused, not entirely certain why, \u201cyour mom thinks you\u2019re with your dad, your dad thinks you\u2019re with your mom, and you just want a few minutes of peace without them hovering.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe boy\u2019s eyes widened, and he stumbled back a few steps. His right hand was crammed in his pocket.\n\u00a0\nPeter lifted his hands defensively. For one, two, three heartbeats, they looked at each other. Then, \u201cIt works best between your index and middle fingers,\u201d Peter suggested.\n\u00a0\nThe boy cocked his head, stupefied. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe keys you have in your pocket,\u201d Peter nodded. \u201cI can see some of them pressed against the fabric. You\u2019ve got one - whichever\u2019s biggest - slid between a couple of your fingers, just in case you need a quick weapon. You get the best control when it\u2019s between your middle and index finger.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSlowly, the boy blinked, then removed his hand from his pocket, empty. \u201cI\u2019m being stupid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe boy sat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI used to do the same thing,\u201d Peter offered eventually. \u201cThe mom and dad trick, not the key trick - well, actually, yeah, the key trick too. They worried a lot.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe boy didn\u2019t reply.\n\u00a0\nThen: \u201cThey say Spider-Man may come here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you - do you think I might get to meet him?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter smiled, just barely. \u201cI think so.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wanted to ask him,\u201d the boy blurted, earnest now, \u201cif it got better for him. After. I - it\u2019s stupid. He won\u2019t come.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter looked at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCarter.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll come, Carter.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCarter looked at Peter, curious. \u201cWhy - why are you here?\u201d he questioned, hesitant.\n\u00a0\nLicking his lips, Peter considered his answer. \u201cI think,\u201d he settled on eventually, \u201cthat I\u2019m here for a lot of the same reasons you are.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCarter nodded carefully. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you want to know a secret, Carter?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA nod.\n\u00a0\nPeter took a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get better. Not for a long time. And it won\u2019t ever go away.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA shaky breath. \u201cThat\u2019s not a very good secret.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not finished yet,\u201d Peter promised. He closed his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to go away. But then - it\u2019ll be different. You\u2019ll be different. One day, you\u2019ll wake up, and you\u2019ll realize that the memories aren\u2019t quite so powerful as they used to be. You\u2019ll realize that, somehow, you were always stronger than them. And you know what will happen then, Carter?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter drummed his fingers on the ground once, twice, three times. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he decided. \u201cYou\u2019ll be different but\u2026 You\u2019ll be okay again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter hated the hospital.\n\u00a0\nThe lights were too bright; the seats too cold; the whispers the doctors hissed to May and Ben too soft.\n\u00a0\nThe tears of his aunt and uncle too loud.\n\u00a0\nPeter drummed his fingers against the cold railing of the bed once, twice, three times.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe seven year old looked up.\n\u00a0\nSmiling kindly, the white-haired nurse reached for his arm, wrinkles and liver-spots staining her hand. \u201cI have to take your blood pressure, Peter.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Peter fumbled, raising his arm carefully. Vaguely, he wondered where his aunt and uncle were, before he remembered that they had been reluctantly coaxed from the room by a stiff-faced doctor. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing to be sorry for,\u201d the woman hummed carefully. Slowly, the thick black band began to tighten around Peter\u2019s arm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you want to hear a secret, Peter? One you may not believe quite yet - but then, few people ever do, when it comes to secrets.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t like secrets anymore. He didn\u2019t like surprises, or things that he couldn\u2019t understand, or magazines that were hidden on high shelves far away from adult eyes. He didn\u2019t want to hear whatever new whisper she had for him, didn\u2019t want to have to decide if it was dangerous or safe.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked instead.\n\u00a0\nThe old lady smiled, something soft and old, and it pulled laugh lines tight across her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay, Peter,\" she promised. \"You\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d\n\u00a0"
