If you\u2019re interested in Honey Butter and Breaking Point, they\u2019re on temporary hiatus until a few chapters have been written to try and lessen the update gap. Similar thing for cut the cord.

    "text": "\n Marinette thought she could handle Lila\u2019s lies - like Adrien said, they were in it together.\n\n\nAnd yet, they weren\u2019t. \n\n\nWhen Lila pretended to trip and fall on her way past Marinette, acting as if she\u2019d tripped over Marinette\u2019s feet, causing her to get sent back to the back row, Adrien said nothing. When Alya cornered Marinette and revealed her crush and secrets to anyone and everyone listening, Adrien did nothing. When Marinette asked him for help, he pretended to hear nothing. \n\n\nThey were\n not\n in it together. They never had been. It had taken her far too long to realise that the \u2018high road\u2019 for Adrien meant pretending that nothing was wrong and sweeping it under the rug - who cares if you get hurt, just don\u2019t make a big deal out of it. Lila could get akumatized, he\u2019d reasoned - but what would happen when someone got akumatized because of her lies? It had almost happened once already, Marinette thought bitterly to herself. It reminded her painfully of all the times Adrien had never bothered doing anything about Chloe - how he had had the nerve to be disappointed in Marinette and the others for daring to be happy that the girl who had bullied them for years was leaving. \n\n\nAnd Alya. Alya, and the rest of the class. Marinette wanted to scream as she thought of the way they had been acting. Her so-called best friend, who had volunteered her to go to the back, hadn\u2019t been listening to her at all. Her eyes stung as she thought back to the last day of the school year.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGirl, I\u2019ve tried to be patient with you but this is ridiculous! You\u2019re acting no better than Chloe - I mean, bullying Lila? That\u2019s not the sort of girl I made friends with. Besides\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019d gone on and on and on, and even Lila had made an appearance, batting her eyelashes and spinning some sob story about how she just didn\u2019t understand why Marinette hates me so bad, I only ever wanted to be friends!\n\u00a0\n\nThe class had turned on their \u2018Everyday Ladybug\u2019 in an instant. She supposed she should have taken Lila\u2019s threat more seriously, but she had still had faith in her friends, in Adrien, then. \n\n\u00a0\n\nShe didn\u2019t anymore. \n\n\u00a0\n\nShe had left school with a heavy heart and returned home to find an acceptance letter waiting on the counter for her. Three months after Lila started her Anti-Marinette campaign, her parents had sat her down and gotten her to tell them everything. Marinette had begged them not to make a scene, but agreed to switch schools. Part of her ached to leave her friends to Lila\u2019s machinations, but what else could she do? She had tried everything to get her friends to see the truth, and yet they refused to hear her.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI only tell people what they want to hear.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s what Lila had told her, and she was able to see the reverse for herself. The class didn't want to believe she was lying, and so it was obviously Marinette that was the problem, Marinette the new class bully, Marinette the strange and freaky girl who bailed out of plans without a reason, Marinette who was just jealous of darling Lila, Marinette who had a \n\ncreepy stalker schedule on her wall, Marinette, Marinette, Marinette! \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette took a deep breath, trying to focus herself on the feeling of Tikki curled up in her hand. She couldn\u2019t run the risk of being akumatized again. Summer had passed without word from any of her old friends, and she hadn\u2019t seen them near the bakery. It was safe to say that she had changed - she\u2019d worried Chat at first, she knew, he was unaccustomed to seeing his Lady so serious and upset. She had also been avoiding Alya - luckily they hadn\u2019t needed to make use of any extra miraculous over the summer. She couldn\u2019t trust Alya, or Nino, anymore, that was for certain. Fu had agreed, when Tikki had finally persuaded her to talk to the Master about everything that had happened. He had not admonished her for it, but said he understood.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI have always told you to choose an ally you can trust, Marinette. If you no longer trust Rena Rouge or Carapace you may second guess yourself in battle, and it may cost you. It is wise of you to retire them. Are you planning on retiring Queen Bee, as well?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m.. not sure, Master. Chloe never exactly defended me, she doesn\u2019t even like me, but she\u2019s the only other person not enamoured with or willing to let Lila\u2019s lies slide, and she\u2019s tried to change since becoming Queen Bee.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI see. Perhaps it would be wise to keep someone who is used to the role of fighting akumas, and if Miss Bourgeois is trying to change then she may be the only one who can.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette felt lighter than she had in weeks following the talk. She\u2019d thrown herself headfirst into designing - her new school was known for promoting student\u2019s individual interests, and she wanted to expand her portfolio. She leant back in her chair and surveyed her room. That had changed too.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBefore, photos of her friends and Adrien had littered the walls, his schedule hidden in its slot, and a wallpaper on her computer boldly declaring her crush. After school had ended, after Alya had ripped her heart in two, she\u2019d looked at her surroundings with a heavy heart, and moved forward. The schedule was gone, replaced a message board pinned to her wall with ideas and inspiration for new designs. The pictures of Adrien, save one of him wearing her derby hat, were also gone, as were the pictures of her friends. She had saved their class photo in a scrapbook, as well as an old selfie she and Alya had taken. The rest had gone into the bin. Her computer wallpaper was still one of her own design, but was now a collage of her summer designs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHer eyes lingered on her scrapbook, and Tikki was a comforting presence on her shoulder.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok to miss people, Marinette. You\u2019ll be ok.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe smiled at her Kwami, and picked up the jacket she had been working on.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks, Tikki. What do you think?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHer new jacket was a deep blue, her signature just underneath the collar, and a ladybug descending down the right side. It was simpler than most clothes she had been designing, but she had wanted something that went fairly well with almost everything and she was proud of the results. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt looks great Marinette! Are you going to wear it to school tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette giggled at her Kwami\u2019s enthusiasm, but shook her head. Her new school had a uniform, simple yet elegant. She had been informed that her small side bag would not be allowed, which had caused a brief moment of panic before Tikki pointed out that there was an inner pocket to the blazer of the uniform that she could hide in. She could, of course, wear the jacket over the blazer as she came and went, but she wasn\u2019t sure if she could consider it a finished piece yet - she was always thinking of new ways to change her clothing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHer mother popped her head through the trapdoor, reminding her to get some rest before the new day tomorrow - her new school was farther away than Dupont, and she would have to fix her sleep schedule if she didn\u2019t want to get a reputation for lateness - damn Hawkmoth. She called goodnight to her parents and climbed up to her bed, Tikki whizzing over to curl up on her pillow.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTomorrow would be the start of \u00a0a new day. She was nervous, and excited.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut, for the first time in months, she felt okay. And that was enough.\n\n\nAs usual, Kagami arrived early to school, eager to make use of the relative quiet to catch up on some things before the majority of other students arrived. Her gaze flickered to the courtyard quickly - sometimes Allegra was just as early to sneak in some more practice on her flute before lessons - and she stopped as her eyes fell on a familiar face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMarinette?\u201d The girl near jumped, turning quickly to face Kagami. Behind her, the school principal and two others she didn\u2019t recognise, presumably Marinette\u2019s parents, turned as well.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c..Hi Kagami\u201d Marinette was smiling, but even she could see that it was tense, strained, nervous? Kagami frowned - she had not necessarily thought highly of Marinette, stringing along Adrien as she did with that other boy, but she couldn\u2019t help but be concerned at the lack of the usual light in the girl\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh, you know Ms Tsurugi already? Wonderful. Well, that\u2019s about all I had to say, if you have any further questions please don\u2019t hesitate to ask me, another teacher, or one of your fellow students\u201d The principal hesitated for a second before continuing, \u201cI hope my school proves to be a much happier environment for you, Ms Dupain-Cheng.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHappier? If Kagami had not been confused before, she most definitely was now, even if it did somewhat explain the dullness of the normally peppy girl.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes.. we hope so too.\u201d Marinette\u2019s mother said, squeezing her daughters shoulder affectionately. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Ms Tsurugi will be able to help you find your way?\u201d The principal said, looking questioningly at her.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d He smiled at her response, before handing a few leaflets to the family and departing. Marinette\u2019s parents hugged her tightly, before leaving as well.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette turned towards her, that nervous smile still plastered on her face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks Kagami, I didn\u2019t know you went here.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe nodded, and the two walked in silence for a while.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo, Marinette. Why did you leave Dupont? You seemed popular and happy.\u201d She asked, wincing slightly as Marinette visibly shrunk in on herself. Damn.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI uh.. I..\u201d She stuttered, before looking away and speaking in a small voice, \u201cI.. may have gotten bullied out of my old school.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami stopped dead. She was not good at this sort of thing, it was Allegra that was always better at being kind and helpful. But, looking at her, she felt the odd need to try.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo.. do you want to talk about it?\u201d She finally asked, placing a hand on the smaller girl\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette stopped, as if she were thinking hard to herself. Eventually, she turned back to Kagami, who tactfully tried to pretend she could not see the glint of tears in her eyes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo you know a Lila Rossi?\u201d She asked\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh, yes. The liar from your class, correct?\u201d Kagami scowled - Adrien had mentioned the girl and her lies, and yet had not seemed concerned about them, even when he told her that Lila had lied about knowing a prominent fencer (whom had died ten years ago, but that was hardly the point), and seemed uninterested in counteracting her. It had struck her as cowardly, but then Adrien often did, and she paid it little heed. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah - she lied about all this crazy grandeur stuff, really stupid simple stuff that could easily be disproved, I mean, come on, any five second internet search could tell you Jagged Stone has never had a cat! I tried to call her out on it, but everyone else believed her and I was sent to the back of the class for it, right out of the seat I\u2019d won from Chloe who\u2019d bullied me for ages at the start of the year, all because my supposed best friend wanted to sit next to her boyfriend and \u2018didn\u2019t think I\u2019d mind\u2019\u201d Marinette\u2019s face had twisted into an angry glare, but Kagami did not interrupt - she had learned from a young age that anger is more quickly dissipated if let out all at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd even then, I kept trying. She kept lying, and tried to suggest that I could have gouged out Max\u2019s eye with a napkin I\u2019d thrown. A napkin! Max, who wears \n\nglasses\n\n and is supposed to be one of the smartest people in Paris if not France, honestly believed he was in danger and the class scolded me for \u2018hurting poor Lila\u2019. And then, she got me in the bathroom - she said she would take all my friends away - I was almost \n\nakumatized\n\n about it I was that upset and -\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe stopped suddenly, throwing her arms up in frustration.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLet me guess - your friends continued to buy into her lies and that threat started to ring true? Did you have no one who believed you?\u201d Kagami asked\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe anger in her eyes quickly faded to sadness.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAdrien knew. He knew she was lying, but he told me to stop trying to call her out - he said that as long as the two of us knew it didn\u2019t really matter - he said he\u2019d be there with me, but.. He wasn\u2019t. The class turned on me, they isolated me, they belittled me, and everytime he wouldn\u2019t \n\ndo anything\n\n. He told me towards the end that maybe I should just pretend to start believing Lila, because if I did the others would eventually forgive me-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe said \n\nwhat\n\n?\u201d Kagami asked, aghast. She knew Agreste could be cowardly at times, but to abandon the girl he obviously cared for to the machinations of a girl that he knew was lying? \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah - when Alya had finished screaming at me about what an awful person I was, he came up and said that maybe I should have given her a second chance, as if I was the one who was in the wrong for trying to protect my friends! If they ever find out she\u2019s lying, they\u2019ll be so hurt, but I tried! I tried so hard.. And they just.. They just..\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAkuma!\u201d A teacher\u2019s cry alerted them, and Kagami spun around to find a blasted purple butterfly heading straight for the now crying girl at her side. She drew her foil, wondering if she could keep Hawkmoth from out of her head for long enough for Ladybug and Chat Noir to show up when Marinette dragged her sleeve across her face and stepped forward.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t allow you to control me. I\u2019m allowed to be upset without you taking advantage of me. I\u2019m.. I\u2019m stronger than you.\u201d Her voice wavered, but she stood firm, and the akuma fluttered away.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami could only watch in wonder. Even when overcome by grief, Marinette could find the strength to keep her mind. It was incredible. The girl turned back to her, wanting to find a bathroom - Kagami pointed one out and settled down on a bench to wait. A few minutes later, excited chatter from the main entrance told her that Ladybug had appeared to purify the stray akuma, easing her nerves. Marinette emerged not too long after, eyes still red but looking more at ease than they had before.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry, Kagami. I guess I still had some cooped up emotions about it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Marinette. I\u2019m.. sorry that you had to go through that - and disappointed that Adrien did not defend the girl he loves.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe confusion on Marinette\u2019s face was evident, and gave her pause.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAdrien has a crush on you. I thought you were aware of this?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo her shock, Marinette chuckled, shaking her head lightly.\n\n\n\u201cNope. He doesn't have a crush on me. I used to crush on him, like badly, but then Lila happened and honestly now I\u2019m not quite sure what I ever saw in him. Adrien has a crush on Ladybug, not me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI.. I see. Then, I owe you an apology, Marinette. I believed that the girl Adrien liked was you, and that you were stringing him along with that other boy from the ice rink.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?? No! Adrien asked me for help going on a date with you, but I felt embarrassed, and a little broken hearted, to go alone, so I asked Luka to come with me. And don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s very nice, but I don\u2019t think I like him like that,\u201d Marinette smiled, the only real smile she had seen so far, \u201cSo why don\u2019t we start over? No misconceptions.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like the sound of that\u201d Kagami smiled, and held out a hand for Marinette to shake, \u201cKagami Tsurugi. Nice to meet you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMarinette Dupain-Cheng. Nice to meet you too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlya collapsed into her seat with a sigh, squeezing Nino\u2019s hand in greeting. Her other hand skimmed over the Ladyblog on her phone. The summer had seen some incredibly strong or elaborate akumas, and yet she had never been offered the chance to become Rena Rouge again. A talk with Nino confirmed that neither of Paris\u2019s heroes had approached him to become Carapace, either. It was a small relief that Queen Bee hadn\u2019t been spotted either - but then, it seemed to Alya that Ladybug had been avoiding her. She knew that the spotted heroine was often close to detransforming once an Akuma had been purified, but she had, at least, always been friendly to Alya. But over summer, she\u2019d swung right past Alya with nothing at all - and even when she\u2019d caught Ladybug on patrol, Ladybug had cut off her questions with a terse \u2018I\u2019m busy\u2019 and had swung away before she could say anything.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe frowned, wondering what she had done wrong, when Lila arrived, settling in her seat in front of her.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs everything ok, Alya?\u201d She asked, concern clear and evident in her voice.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLila, I don\u2019t suppose you could tell me if Ladybug\u2019s mad at me?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nLila stopped rummaging in her bag, and smiled up at her friend.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Alya, Ladybug\u2019s just been so busy with all those Akumas and she\u2019s a bit stressed - she\u2019s definitely not mad at you though - she tells me how much she loves your blog all the time!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAt Lila\u2019s words, a weight lifted off her shoulders - Lila was Ladybug\u2019s best friend, she\u2019d know and wouldn\u2019t lie if Ladybug actually was. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks, Lila - I was just worried, y\u2019know?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n Lila smiled, before launching into a story of yet another amazing person she\u2019d hung out with over summer. Alya hung onto every word - her friend was amazing. Even if \n\nsome people\n\n couldn\u2019t see it, she thought, sending a quick glance up to the back row. Marinette hadn\u2019t shown up yet, and to be honest? She was sort of grateful for it. Marinette had been nothing but vile to Lila ever since she\u2019d come back - she couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d ever called that girl her best friend - honestly, all that fuss over a seat change? Her crush was way out of control. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAlya thought nothing of it when the bell rang and Marinette hadn\u2019t arrived yet. She was often late. It was odd that Ms Bustier went through the attendance, and didn\u2019t call her name - but maybe she just didn\u2019t want to concern herself when she could clearly see that Marinette was not present. It was odder when the bell rang for first period, and Marinette still wasn\u2019t there. She almost missed Adrien\u2019s quick glance up to the back row, but paid it no mind. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBut then Marinette didn\u2019t turn up at all, and her name wasn\u2019t called in any class. It was the last period, when Lila piped up.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey Ms Bustier? Is Marinette okay? I haven\u2019t seen her all day.\u201d Alya smiled - it was so much like Lila to worry about a girl that had bullied her relentlessly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMarinette is no longer attending this school.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlya blanched - she knew the girl was dramatic, but this was way too far. She had to go there after school and shake some sense into the girl - she\u2019d get along so well with Lila if she could just let go of that awful jealousy.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, this is all my fault,\u201d Lila lamented, \u201cI should have tried harder to get her to like me\u201d she sniffled, and immediately the class turned to reassure her, Alya among them, and Ms Bustier had to slam a book down on her desk to be heard above the noise, shutting the class up immediately.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, class. We have work to finish - open your textbooks to page 86 and read the highlighted text.\u201d She said coldly, a tone that surprised Alya - a quick glance around the class confirmed that she was not the only one.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJust what was going on today?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the time the final bell had rung, Marinette\u2019s head was swimming with the new names and faces she\u2019d met. Kagami had introduced her to her small group of friends - Allegra, a tall brunette with a kind smile who was apparently a very skilled flutist as well as the student leader for their year, Claude, a small blonde boy with an infectious laugh, and Apollo, who was aptly named if his love for science was anything to go by. They\u2019d easily accepted Marinette into their fold, each making sure she had someone to help her find her way around, and slowly but surely she\u2019d let down her guard. It felt like she was also meeting Kagami for the first time - she was blunt, but she wasn\u2019t the cold Ice Queen she had previously believed her to be. She paused on the stairs outside the main entrance - presumably, in the time it would take her to get home, her old class would have dispersed from Dupont and she wouldn\u2019t have to see them, but she still worried. She heard a shout and looked down to see Kagami waving her over from a sleek silver car.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI am going to fencing practice at Dupont. You live nearby, correct? I suppose you may be looking to avoid your old classmates.\u201d She gestured for Marinette to join her inside.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette nodded gratefully and slid in beside her. The drive to the bakery was short, and as she leant forward to direct Kagami\u2019s driver, the bakery came into view and her heart sank.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlya was standing outside, arms crossed and glaring out into the road.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami followed her line of sight and scoffed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIs there another entrance?\u201d Marinette nodded, and directed them around the corner.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette thanked them both before disappearing inside and Kagami sighed as they drove back onto the main street.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTai, stop here, please.\u201d She requested, eyes fixed on the auburn haired girl that had given Marinette so much grief.\n\n\nIt had been just over a month since Marinette had transferred to her new school, and, if nothing else, it had confirmed to her she had made the right choice. Her new friends were kind, funny and intensely protective - as she\u2019d found out two weeks in, when she had eventually gotten around to telling Allegra, Claude and Apollo the reason she had left DuPont. Allegra\u2019s typically sunny smile had grown ice cold in an instant, and for a second she had feared she\u2019d need to restrain Claude from marching over to DuPont to deal with the \u2018lying witch\u2019, as he had dubbed Lila, himself. Kagami had already faced off with Alya, she knew, and it had gone about as well as anyone had expected. Later that night, she had finally blocked Alya\u2019s number, unable to deal with the multitude of, frankly, rude messages she\u2019d received in the hours following her arrival at home. She\u2019d blocked the rest of the class as well, including Adrien - he had texted her something roughly the time after their fencing practice was over, but she had deleted it without looking. Probably something berating her for not being a doormat. Her phone was, however, more active than ever before - her new friends had quickly added her to their group chat, as well as a larger class-wide one - Allegra and Claude were in her class, with Kagami and Apollo being in the class further down the corridor. \n\n\u00a0\n\nShe was happy, though, and people were noticing.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou look happier these days, My Lady.\u201d Chat Noir spoke up from behind her, startling her from her perch on top of the Eiffel Tower.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou scared me, minou!\u201d She pouted, settling down as Chat swung down to join her, smiling apologetically, \u201cBut yes, I am a lot happier now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad. If you do need me to cataclysm anyone, though, just let me know,\u201d He grinned, \u201cI\u2019ll do it in a heartbeat to whoever made you so sad over summer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRelax, Chat. You can\u2019t cataclysm civilians - I\u2019m practically over it. How are you feeling anyway? It has been a while.\u201d She mused - the two hadn\u2019t been able to do a patrol together since the summer, and they were never able to really stick around following akuma attacks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feline fine, milady!\u201d Chat grinned, snickering when Ladybug rolled her eyes at his pun, \u201cMy schedule is finally clearing up a bit, so I can take back some more patrols again\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood to hear, kitty.\u201d Chat\u2019s civilian life had kept him busy over summer, and so she had taken on the majority of patrols.\n\n\n\n\n\nChat grinned again, opening his mouth to say something when an explosion echoed in the distance.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAn Akuma. Great.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShall we, my lady?\u201d Chat stood, extending his hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe nodded, and the Heroes of Paris swung out to take down Hawkmoth\u2019s latest akumatized victim.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nA giant of green was rampaging through the streets of Paris, faster than either hero was expecting. They landed across from the Akuma. Upon closer inspection, the green masses were piles and piles of leaves, swirling about as if they had their own mind - just inside, a man could be seen floating at the centre of the mass, clutching a thick book. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cChat - the Akuma may be in that book, we just need to get through those leaves.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nChat nodded and threw himself towards the mass - the man turned and thrust a hand out towards him, and the leaves followed his cue, whipping out towards Chat and sending him flying backwards.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLadybug and Chat Noir! I am the gardener! My trade was disrespected and now all of Paris will face my wrath! Give me your Miraculous!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou ever feel like Hawkmoth is starting to run out of ideas, my lady?\u201d Chat Noir asked, landing next to her. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBefore she could answer, the man\u2019s book glowed, and the leaves spread out, forming a sphere that was impossible to see through. When it faded, there were eight smaller forms where one once stood, each looking completely identical.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGreat! Leaf Man has illusions\u201d Chat sighed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI am the Gardener!\u201d \n\nThe forms shrieked, tendrils of leaves racing out to grab them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLadybug and Chat Noir darted across the rooftops. The forms merged back into one, easily hauling itself up onto the rooftops to follow.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMaybe we could use some illusions of our own, eh?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nLadybug nodded, and with a quick goodbye Chat Noir had successfully gained the Akuma's full attention, giving Ladybug the room she needed to race to Master Fu.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFive minutes later, Marinette was kneeling in front of the Miraculous Box, hesitating over the jewellery.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf I may advise, Marinette, you may wish to make use of both Trixx and Longg.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLongg?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe dragon miraculous!\u201d Tikki piped up, \u201cHis Inferno may be useful for the Gardener.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe picked up the Dragon Miraculous, a black necklace with a flame-decorated pendant attached - smaller than the fox pendant, which she hesitated over.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHave you found a potential wielder, Marinette? Somebody you can trust?\u201d Fu asked, eyes creasing in concern.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette considered it for a moment - Tikki nudged her phone, notifications lighting up her screen. She glanced down quickly, and made up her mind.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, Master. I believe I have.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd with that, she transformed and darted out. She was getting close to the Akuma, when a flash of blue hair caught her attention. There in the alley, Kagami stood with her foil drawn, staring up at the wall as if contemplating the best way to scale it. Ladybug landed behind her, and the girl whipped around, the frown on her face becoming more neutral when she saw who it was.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood evening, Ladybug.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKagami, everything okay?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYour partner took me out of the fight. I was handling myself, but supposedly it is too dangerous for civilians.\u201d She said, scowling. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, it is. But what if you weren\u2019t just a civilian?\u201d She asked, trying to hide a smile at the confusion on Kagami\u2019s face. She held out the box of the Dragon Miraculous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cKagami Tsurugi. Here, if you wish to accept it, is the Miraculous of the Dragon, which wields the power of conviction. You will use it for the greater good. Once the job is complete, you will return the Miraculous to me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami took the box almost reverently, flipping the lid and quickly shielding her eyes from the flash that followed, staring at the red Kwami that formed in front of her.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLongg stretched out and bowed to Kagami. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHello. I am Longg.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami attached the necklace around her neck as Longg went over her powers.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou have a sword with which to fight. You do not have a way to travel quickly, such as Ladybug with her yo-yo, as my wielders are fast of foot and of mind - you do not need an extra tool. Your power is Inferno - your blade will be as alight as your conviction, and you can send your flames out a considerable distance. Once you have called Inferno, you will have five minutes before you detransform. You will be kept aware of how much time you have left from the flames on your necklace. They will extinguish one at a time with each minute.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUnderstood. How do I transform?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI like this one,\u201d Longg smiled at Ladybug, \u201cYou need only say \u2018Longg, fire up\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLongg, fire up!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami transformed, her usual outfit turning into a dark red suit not unlike her fencing uniform, with a small belt looped around the middle to hold her swords sheath at her back.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat shall we call you?\u201d Ladybug asked.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c.. Call me Kasai.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRight. Kasai, I need you to help Chat lure the Gardener towards the Eiffel Tower. I will be back with another hero in a few minutes - please try to not use your Inferno until I get back with them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKasai nodded and darted back towards the fight. Ladybug turned and ran, calling Chat to quickly update him on the situation. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSoon, she hung outside Allegra\u2019s house, waving to catch the brunette\u2019s attention from her bedroom window. Allegra\u2019s face lit up when she spotted her, hurriedly moving to let her in.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLadybug? What are you doing here? The Akuma, isn\u2019t it still out there? Why-\u201d She cut herself off when Ladybug held out her second box.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAllegra Collette. This is the miraculous of the fox, which grants the power of illusion. You will use it for the greater good, and when the job is done you must return it to me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWoah! Wait, like Rena Rouge? Why didn\u2019t you just go to her?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRena Rouge has been retired. The mantle of the Fox will fall to you if you choose to accept it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI will. I won\u2019t let you down, Ladybug.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAllegra opened the box, and Trixx came flying out.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTrixx, I-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere is no need, Ladybug. Master already explained everything to me.\u201d Trixx spoke before she could even finish, a reassuring smile on his face before he turned to Allegra and quickly briefed her on her new powers. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSoon enough, Allegra transformed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat should we call you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCall me Melodie!\u201d She grinned, throwing her flute from hand to hand. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey were at the fight moments later. Kasai and Chat had cornered the Gardener underneath the Eiffel Tower, but he had split and become difficult to control. They landed next to the pair.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere you are, milady! And with Rena - wait. You\u2019re not Rena Rouge!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, this is Melodie. Rena Rouge has been retired, permanently. Melodie is the new fox wielder.\u201d Ladybug corrected, relaxing slightly when Chat Noir grinned and shook her hand. They could do this.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll of them missed the quiet gasp from below. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAlya ended her footage, slipping her phone back in her pocket with a shaking hand. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMelodie. Melodie, not Rena. Melodie.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe had been replaced. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAbove her, she heard the familiar call of \n\nMirage\n\n, and numerous copies of the four leapt at the eight copies of the Akuma, who quickly merged back into one. Ladybug called her Lucky Charm, and the new hero called out \n\nInferno\n\n, the sword she had been wielding becoming encased in flame, allowing her and Chat to break through the leaves. Ladybug broke the Akuma with her Charm, and the Miraculous Cure soon followed. Ladybug ran with the new heroes before she could summon the urge to call out after her.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, Ladyblogger! Out late, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Chat landed behind her, his trademark grin slipping slightly when he saw her face, \u201cEverything okay?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c..What\u2019s with the new Fox hero, Chat?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNot sure,\u201d Chat shrugged, \u201cI trust LB though, and we\u2019d discussed retiring\u00a0Rena over summer, so\u2026\u201d His Miraculous beeped, indicating he was on his last minute.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Alya, guessing you were a Rena fan? If you can catch me or LB on patrol, we\u2019ll probably be able to give more detail to our favourite blogger. Cat out!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nWith a wink and mock salute, Chat leapt over the rooftops and out of sight, leaving the former Fox hero wondering just what it was she had done wrong.\n\n\nMarinette returns home one day to find Penny Rolling in her kitchen, laughing with her mother over tea and some chocolate chip cookies they\u2019d baked the day before. Penny lights up when she sees her, wrapping her in a hug. She explains that Jagged wanted her to come and see him at his suite in the Hotel, and after a nod of approval from her mother she skips up the stairs to change and meets Penny in the car. Marinette shrinks down a little when they pass her old school, a move that doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by Penny, but she doesn\u2019t bring it up immediately.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJagged grins from ear to ear when they arrive and slings an arm around her shoulders as they sit down.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMarinette! Good to see ya again!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood to see you too,\u201d Marinette laughs, waving to Fang in the corner. She knows he probably doesn\u2019t register it, but it didn\u2019t feel right to ignore him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo, my little rockstar, Penny said your mom had said you switched schools?\u201d He asked, watching her curiously.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh.. yeah. I decided to go to a school that\u2019d help out my career aspirations a bit more, that\u2019s all!\u201d Marinette gives an awkward smile and tries to laugh it off, but Penny frowns and leans forward.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThen why did you shrink the way you did when we passed DuPont?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe question is innocent enough, but Marinette\u2019s face falls, and she drops her gaze, unable to meet either of them in the eye.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMarinette?\u201d Jagged\u2019s voice is soft, and the dam bursts.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe really thought she would be over crying about them by now.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey let her cry herself out, and when she\u2019s done Penny passes her a glass of water and a wipe to clean her face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat happened, Nette? Please, tell us the truth.\u201d She says, taking up the other empty spot on the sofa.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd she does. She tells them everything about Lila, about Adrien, about every way the class had treated her. She tells them she was nearly akumatized, and Jagged shoots up, angrily pacing around the room, disturbing Fang in the process and good lord Marinette had never known there were so many ways to curse in French. Penny takes both her hands in her own, and they let Jagged run out of steam, before he drops down in front of her and covers their hands in his too.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh, Marinette. I\u2019m so sorry. I.. I\u2019m sorry. You didn\u2019t deserve that kinda treatment.\u201d His voice is uncharacteristically serious, and he looks pained on her behalf.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks, Jagged. It.. It hurts, still, but I really am doing much better now. I have some great new friends and my designs are improving all the time!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nJagged smiles, and the topic is passed over. She leaves almost an hour later with a promise to organise a dinner with her parents later in the week, and new inspiration for an outfit scribbled down in her phone. She\u2019s still engrossed in a conversation with Penny when she collides with someone around the corner.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHey! Watch where you\u2019re goin- Wait, Dupain-Cheng?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nChloe stands blinking in front of her. Penny puts her hand on Marinette\u2019s shoulder protectively, but she smiles and motions that it's alright.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHi Chloe, how\u2019ve you been?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nChloe seems thrown by the question for a second, looking at Marinette like she\u2019s someone she can\u2019t quite figure out - she tries and fails to look like the haughty blonde Marinette remembers, but there\u2019s a bitterness in her eyes that\u2019s not too unfamiliar.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOther than our sheep class blindly following Lie-La? Fine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEven Sabrina, huh?\u201d Marinette\u2019s suspicions are confirmed when Chloe looks down, \u201cYou know, I always thought you believed Lila too.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?! How dare you I would never..\u201d Marinette raises an eyebrow as Chloe fades away, gaze flicking quickly between Marinette and Penny.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPenny squeezes her shoulder and tells her she\u2019ll meet her in the car.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChloe slumps the second she's gone, and it's such a drastic change in her usual demeanor that Marinette has to look down to confirm she isn't currently transformed. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI.. I used to. I was jealous, and I thought the whole song thing was true, because hey Jagged likes \n\nyou \n\nso it\u2019s not too unbelievable. But then I saw how the class started to act, and I wasn\u2019t there the first month back at school and when I came back I was alone, and Adrien he - \u201c\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTried to tell you that her lies weren\u2019t hurting anyone, right?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nChloe\u2019s eyes snap up in shock.The lack of his usual nickname didn\u2019t go unnoticed, and she nods for the blonde to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes! I yelled at him that I was hurting, and I guess Lila overheard, because the next day she- God I don\u2019t know why I ever thought you were the enemy (\u201cChloe..\u201d) because at least you\u2019re a nice person - she told everyone I\u2019d made fun of Adrien about his mom disappearing, that I\u2019d taunted him by saying at least my mom was still around. And then everyone yelled at me about her, because lets be honest here (\u201cChloe.\u201d) my mom isn\u2019t exactly around and-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cChloe!\u201d Marinette finally manages to cut through her rant, and passes her the packet of tissues Penny had given her earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDid Adrien stand up for you?\u201d She asks. She\u2019s certain she already knows the answer, and Chloe\u2019s short bitter laugh as she wipes the worst of her ruined makeup off of her face is all the confirmation she needed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou were right to leave, Marinette. Those idiots, they\u2019re ridiculous, utterly ridiculous! You\u2019re the number one person they could\u2019ve asked to prove what Lila was saying - you know Jagged Stone, you know Adrien, you\u2019re freaking Ladybug, you\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette\u2019s mouth drops open, completely missing the tail end of Chloe\u2019s sentence.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nChloe looks confused, for a second, before horror flashes across her face and she claps her hand over her mouth. She grabs her hand and runs up to her suite, stammering apologies all the way. Marinette can almost hear Tikki stifling a giggle at the absurdity of it all.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone, I swear!\u201d She says when the doors shuts behind them, \u201cI just, I figured it out, and that\u2019s partially how I knew Lila was lying because there\u2019s no way she\u2019s besties with Ladybug and enemies with you-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLike you, you mean?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nChloe has the decency to look ashamed, at least.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah. Like me. And about that.. I wanted to apologise. I treated you like garbage for no real reason - I was a bully, and a coward, and a fraud and you have no obligation to accept my apology or forgive me. And.. It\u2019s going to sound selfish of me, but I need to know. Are you going to replace Queen Bee too?\u201d\n\n\nChloe\u2019s expression is almost heart breaking, and it makes her consider her words carefully.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cChloe.. You aren\u2019t a good person,\u201d Her face falls, \u201cBut you could become one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShock quickly replaces the anguish and she leans forward.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve hurt me, but you\u2019ve also been a good hero. I replaced Rena because I couldn\u2019t trust her civilian self any longer, either as Marinette or as Ladybug, but I\u2019ve never really been able to trust you as Marinette, even if I suppose I can as Ladybug. And because of that, I\u2019m not going to replace Queen Bee - but now that you know my identity, I need to know I can trust you as me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI.. thank you, Marinette. I\u2019ll become a better person, I\u2019ll be worthy of your trust, I promise.\u201d Chloe swore.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette nods, Tikki giving her an approving smile from her purse, and pauses with her hand on the door.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWould you like to hang out with my friends and I on Saturday?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKagami opens the door to the bakery at precisely three in the afternoon that Saturday, and is promptly bowled over by Apollo, who grins and leads her behind the counter, past a large man that smiles and waves at the register and up into the apartment.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKagami! Hello!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami glances over to greet Marinette and stops dead in her tracks. \u00a0She, Claude and Allegra, as well as another blonde girl she\u2019s sure she recognises but can\u2019t place, are gathered around the kitchen counter, laden with cookies, icing bags in hand. Marinette is smiling, hair tied back into a bun, with a pale pink blouse and pleated white skirt. The ensemble suits her, and Apollo has to nudge her to get her moving again. Kagami greets her friends, and can\u2019t help the small feeling of satisfaction when Marinette moves aside to make room for Kagami at her side.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSabine and Nette are teaching us how to decorate cookies!\u201d Claude explains, showing off an\u2026 interesting looking design of blue and green swirls.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami glances at the girl she doesn\u2019t recognise, and Marinette fills in.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh! Kagami, this is Chloe. She\u2019s an old classmate of mine - she and I are starting over, I guess?\u201d\n\n\nThe girl, Chloe, gives her a hesitant nod, before returning to her board of cookies - Kagami notes that all of her designs seem to be bee themed for some reason.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd this is my mom!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette motions to a kind looking woman, who smiles and brings over two more boards for Apollo and Kagami to use.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you, Mrs Dupain-Cheng.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, please, dear. Call me Sabine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami nods, and picks up a bag of pink icing hesitantly. \u00a0Baking, and decorating, was \n\nnot \n\nher forte - though by the looks of things, the only one whose forte it was was Marinette\u2019s. The girl in question happily adjusts the position of the bag in Kagami\u2019s hands, presumably oblivious to the way she short circuits Kagami\u2019s brain and to the knowing smirk Allegra shoots her way.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey decorate in amicable silence - Claude, predictably, is the first to break it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo Nette, did you make that outfit?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYep! Finished it last night - it\u2019s not my usual style but I like it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt suits you - you look very nice Marinette,\u201d Kagami says, \u201cYou are a very talented seamstress - I would not be opposed to wearing a design of yours at my competitions should the rules allow it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette drops her icing bag onto the table and stammers, \u00a0cheeks red. Apollo mutters something along the lines of \n\nyou didn\u2019t have to break her, K\n\n under his breath while Allegra tries and fails to stifle a giggle.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s evening when they leave, all with carefully tied boxes of cookies under their arms. Kagami gives Marinette a quick hug before she leaves, that small satisfied feeling swelling up when she blushes and stammers through her goodbye. She settles into the seat of the car, smiling to herself. She never hesitates, and Marinette is a much worthier target. \n\n\u00a0\n\nShe doesn\u2019t look back at the bakery, though.\u00a0But maybe she should have - she would have seen the storm on the horizon.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChloe is the last to leave, blinking as Marinette\u2019s dad passes her another box to put in her limo. They eventually drift upstairs, and Chloe turns to Marinette, whose cheeks are still pink.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 you and Kagami, huh?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cW- What? I\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about Chloe.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUh huh..\u201d Chloe doesn\u2019t buy that for a second, but she drops it, heading out the door to drop the last box in. She turns to say a last goodbye to Marinette when a shriek catches both of their attention.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat. The. Fuck?!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nStanding there, looking royally pissed off, is Alya.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette\u2019s eyes dart towards the bakery doors, but Alya marches forward before she can act.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh no. Hell no. You are not running away from this Marinette! I don\u2019t understand you anymore! First you act like a raging bitch to Lila, then you leave because you can\u2019t get Adrien, and now you\u2019re hanging out with Chloe? You\u2019ve not returned \n\nany\n\n of my calls, girl! Come on, I thought I knew you better than this.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI thought I knew you better too. I haven\u2019t returned your calls because I blocked you, Alya, and all that outburst has done is prove I made the right choice. This was never about Lila, and I fell out of love with Adrien long before I left DuPont. Lila is a liar, and one day you will all realise.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLila isn\u2019t a liar, you\u2019re just jealous!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA quick google search would disprove half of her claims. But I have put that behind me now. You dumped me, all of you, for a compulsive liar, and I will not be there to pick up the pieces when you realise that. Now, leave. You are not welcome at this bakery.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlya\u2019s face goes red, and Chloe pulls out her phone just in case she either has to call the police or put up an Akuma alert because honestly she\u2019s not sure which one\u2019s more likely at this point.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlya opens her mouth a few times but nothing comes out, and just as quickly as she stormed up she storms off. Chloe looks between her retreating figure and Marinette, whose eyes are glassy, and her worried looking parents who obviously came to investigate the yelling behind her, and gives her former enemy a quick hug before getting into her limo.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe second Chloe\u2019s limo disappears around the corner Marinette turns on her heel, pushes past her parents, walks into her room, sinks down onto her chaise, and cries.\n\n\n\"En garde! Pr\u00eats? Allez!\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami slipped around Claude\u2019s defense and landed her eighth and final point of the match. She removed her mask, moving to shake Claude\u2019s hand as the blond removed his own, his eyes gleaming as the referee read out the score: 8 - 6. He had been close this time, and yet she knew neither the loss nor the closeness of the score would faze him. That was just the way Claude was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNice job, Kagami!\u201d He tucks his mask under one arm. \u201cLooking to impress, are we?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami follows his cocky grin to where Marinette, Allegra and Apollo are sat, watching the various matches. Allegra and Apollo\u2019s gazes are wandering between those still fighting.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette\u2019s gaze is very firmly fixed on her. Her eyes widen when she realises the pair are staring back, quickly averting her gaze to a pair Allegra is watching.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been watching you this entire time, y\u2019know.\u201d Claude teases, before jogging off to the trio, presumably before Kagami can kill him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami rolls her eyes at his retreating back and follows. And if she stretches a little just to see Marinette\u2019s reaction, who can blame her?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere was a storm in Ms Bustier\u2019s classroom that morning, and Adrien could only watch it stew in the seat of one Alya Cesaire.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis friend was \n\nseething\n\n. A glance at Nino proved he had about as much idea as to what was upsetting Alya as he did.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUm.. Al? Babe? Talk to me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt takes a minute or so for Alya to speak, but with twenty minutes to spare before Ms Bustier typically arrives and twenty five before the start of class, as well as the anger emanating from her eyes, neither boy is inclined to press her.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI went to see \n\nher\n\n. Last night.\u201d Alya jerks her head to the back of the classroom.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNino and Adrien share a look of understanding. Alya had gone to see Marinette.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo, what happened?\u201d Adrien is almost hesitant to ask\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShe was hanging out with Chloe!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdrien takes advantage of Nino pressing for details to sneak a glance at the blonde in question. Chloe arrived during the commotion, sweeping past the class to settle at the back. She meets his gaze for a fraction of a second before staring down at her notebook. He frowns, and turns his attention back to Nino and Alya.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c - and I can\u2019t believe she\u2019d do this!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt sounds like Alya\u2019s just finished ranting, but she\u2019s looking at Adrien expectantly like she\u2019s waiting for his response. Crap.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll come around Alya - to this, to Lila, to everything,\u201d He smiles, hands raised in a pacifying gesture, \u201cI\u2019m sure she just needs time to get over every- \n\nouch!\n\n\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlya and Nino look at him with concern, but he gives a flimsy excuse and heads to the bathroom. The second the door shuts behind him, he angrily glares inside his jacket.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInside, Plagg has stuck his claws through Adrien\u2019s shirt and is hanging on tightly. He looks angrier than Adrien has ever seen him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she just needs time to get over everything?\u201d Plagg repeats, scoffing and flying out of the jacket before Adrien can catch him. \u201cNeed I remind you \n\nLila \n\nis the one in the wrong here?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about Plagg? Lila\u2019s lies aren\u2019t hurting anyone.\u201d Adrien answered shortly, narrowing his eyes at the Kwami.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTell me, Adrien. How does Hawkmoth akumatise people?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnswer the question, kid.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2026 preys on people\u2019s negative emotions?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes. Emotional hurt - caused by lies! Lies can cause akumas!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh please. Since when have lies ever caused an akumatisation?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPlagg narrowed his eyes, flying close to Adrien\u2019s face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOne word, kid. Copycat.\u201d He hissed. \u201cWhen you decided to lie about you and Ladybug being together, you caused that sculptor to get akumatised.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything, Plagg! It doesn\u2019t change the fact that Lila\u2019s lies aren\u2019t hurting anyone!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPlagg scowled, glaring at his Chosen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow can you be so blind? Did you not see the way that Alya was talking about bakery girl? Lila\u2019s lies did that!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, Marinette did that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPlagg\u2019s mouth dropped open for a brief moment before he snapped it shut and sent Adrien the most scathing glare he could muster.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLadybug would be disappointed in you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdrien snarls. They\u2019ve had this conversation before and it usually almost ends the same way, with them not talking to each other for a few days. But Adrien is angry and Plagg is looking smug \n\nas if he\u2019s right what does he know\n\n and he snatches the Kwami out of the air and hisses at him to\n\n stop talking\n\n, stuffing him unceremoniously back in his jacket and heading out of the bathroom.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHidden beneath the fabric, Plagg runs a paw over the space where his mouth used to be and wonders what it will take to get through to his Chosen.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBack in the classroom, Alya feels her mood slip from bad to worse when Ms Bustier allows the class to see news footage of the new fox hero. She and Kasai has been seen, though not at the same time, for the two most recent Akuma attacks. \n\n\u00a0\n\nShe watches Melodie wave shyly to the camera before bounding after Ladybug, Chat departing the other way with his signature wink and salute. She thinks back to his parting comment, the offer of an interview. Ladybug was still ignoring her, and Chat was seemingly cool about everything. It was \n\ninfuriating, \n\nit was -\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c- right, Alya?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe starts at her own name and looks down to the front row. Rose is beaming up at her, and Lila is smiling, cheeks red as she twists back to see her too.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUm, sorry Rose, I didn\u2019t catch that.\u201d Alya apologises\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Alya! I was just saying that Lila looked really happy to see Melodie in the news!\u201d Rose says, and Lila ducks down, looking almost shy.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you a fan, Lila?\u201d Sabrina asks, forever eager.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLila deliberates for a second, (almost) the entire class waiting on her answer. Then, she beams, and opens her arms wide.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really supposed to say anything, but I know I can trust you guys! The reason I\u2019m so happy to see Melodie in the news is because,\u201d She drops her voice, \u201cI\u2019m just so glad that Ladybug gave me the Miraculous back from that ridiculous faux fox!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt takes a second for Alya to register the words. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2026 Ridiculous? \n\nFaux fox?!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNino squeezes her hands hard under the table, and she\u2019s the first to speak, fighting to keep her voice even.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about Lila?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nLila beams at her, completely oblivious to the war she\u2019s sparked inside the reporter.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was Rena Rouge!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI used to be Rena Rouge!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt takes everything in Alya not to freak out. \n\nSince when?\n\n Chloe scoffs audibly, and Lila tilts her head, smiling sweetly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, Chloe! Ladybug gave me the fox, because we\u2019re such good friends! My debut was with those awful multiplying demonic akumas, remember? Afterwards, though, I had to give it back to Ladybug because of my travels with my mother. She gave it to some brat that \n\ncompletely\n\n destroyed the reputation I\u2019d built up as Rena, so I changed my persona to Melodie so Paris wouldn\u2019t think I was the same person!\u201d She laughs at that, and Alya feels her heart sink to the floor.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2026.She\u2019d destroyed her reputation? \n\nHad she really been that poor of a hero? She\u2019s desperately trying to stop the shake in her hands when Nino speaks up.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c...Multiplying demon akumas? You mean Sapotis? Alya\u2019s sisters?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nLila\u2019s face falls briefly, and she turns to Alya.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh no! Alya, I didn\u2019t mean to insult your sisters like that, I\u2019m so sorry! It was just such a hard akuma and I\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlya doesn\u2019t pay attention to the rest of the sentence.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLila said her debut was Sapotis.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t right.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSapotis had been \n\nAlya\u2019s \n\ndebut.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlya \n\nwas the Fox hero - the \n\nonly\n\n Fox hero. She always had been.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI thought you were still travelling when Sapotis happened, Lila?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe fox can do illusions, Sabrina!\u201d She beams, \u201cSo I was able to help from afar, but it took so much energy and I can only do so much, so I gave it back to Ladybug so she could have someone to help her more often!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe class match her smile, murmuring praises and affections.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChloe scoffs again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd why tell us? I can say from personal experience that\u2019s a poor move.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, Chloe, you told all of Paris. I can trust my friends in here, right?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe class murmurs their agreement.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlya feels like she might be sick. She stands suddenly, ignoring the concern from her classmates, and pushes her way out of the room, purposefully ignoring Ms Bustier calling after her. She locks herself in a bathroom stall, pulls out her phone, and brings up Google.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLila Rossi\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLila Rossi Jagged Stone\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLila Rossi Jagged Stone Airport\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLila Rossi Jagged Stone Airport Kitten\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLila Rossi Stephen Spielberg\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLila Rossi Achu\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLila Rossi Achu Prince Ali.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe only link with her name, staring Alya right in the face as though it's taunting her, is her Ladyblog interview. She brings up a hand to cover her mouth, the screen blurring in front of her.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA quick google search would disprove half of her claims. But I have put that behind me, now. You have dumped me, all of you, for a compulsive liar, and I will not be there to pick up the pieces when you realise that.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette\u2019s words repeat over and over again, like a burning mantra in her brain.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOh God.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOh \n\nGod.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe replays the last school year in her mind. Linking arms with Lila as she not-so-accidentally shoves against Marinette in the hallway, snickering when stumbles and the books in her hands fall to the ground. \u00a0Repeating every subtle dig and insult until the entire class was saying it too. Revealing her crush to the school just to embarrass her. Pushing her up against the wall and yelling at her, following it up with vicious texts that she \n\nknows the girl read, and oh god what the hell is wrong with her some reporter she was why did she ever believe -\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlya?! Alya, are you alright?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt takes a few minutes for her to register Rose\u2019s voice, and she opens the stall shakily. \n\n\u00a0\n\nRose hands her tissues, and it\u2019s only then she realises that she\u2019s crying.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nKagami really wants to throw something.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd right now, Adrien Agreste is looking like a wonderful target.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis heart isn\u2019t in training today, and as much as she wants to hate him for hurting Marinette, she also wants to have a somewhat productive fencing lesson, especially with a tournament just weeks away. So she sighs, grabs the blonde by the wrist, ignoring his squeak of surprise, and marches away to a hallway where they won\u2019t be disturbed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSpill, Agreste.\u201d She crosses her arms, dropping her mask down on a bench, and waits.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt takes a minute, but eventually, Adrien removes his mask, though he, infuriatingly, still won\u2019t look her in the eye. She says nothing, just raises an eyebrow. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI feel like you\u2019re mad at me.\u201d He eventually admits, and she can\u2019t stop the snort that escapes her.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow observant of you, Adrien. I \n\nam\n\n. What I would like to know, however, is if you \n\nknow\n\n what exactly it is I am mad at you about?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdrien wrings his hands together nervously.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMarinette?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMarinette.\u201d She nods.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t want any trouble, you know that, right? Exposing Lila wouldn\u2019t have made her any better. She got akumatized when Ladybug called her out, if Marinette did the same Lila would just get akumatized again.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s only\n\n\u00a0Lila \n\ngetting\n\u00a0akumatized you\u2019re worried about? Lila, in general?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdrien finally looks her in the eyes then, but she holds a hand up before he can protest.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, do not try to deny it. Marinette has been almost akumatized four times because of Lila, and the fact that Ladybug and Chat Noir have not had to face off against her yet is a testament to her brevity and courage. And yet, she should not have to. She told me how you promised her that you were in her corner, but when the class started to turn on her, you were hiding in with the bullies,\u201d She scoffed, \u201cIt seems I was right to call you a coward. You should have supported her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut - !\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShut. Up.\u201d Her tone was icy.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd not to mention, Adrien, you should have supported not just Marinette, but your class as well. Nino is your best friend, no? How do you think he will take the news that you simply allowed Lila to make fools of everyone and taint their opinions of their \u2018Everyday Ladybug\u2019, to the point where they gleefully chased her out of the school? Your inaction will cause everyone to hurt just as Marinette has.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut they didn\u2019t believe her from the start!\u201d Adrien cries, \u201cAnd if they didn\u2019t believe their \u2018Everyday Ladybug, why would they believe me? They\u2019d turn on me too!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nEvidently, that had been the wrong thing to say. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIf looks could kill, Adrien Agreste would be a dead man.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d Kagami is fuming, \u201cSo you\u2019re fine with watching everyone be played for fools, with your friend being belittled and chased out of school, as long as you are not caught in the crossfire? \u00a0You \n\nare \n\na coward, and a selfish one at that, but allow me to break your little bubble of complacency. You are already \n\nin\n\n the crossfire. Lila\u2019s lies will be exposed, maybe not by Marinette, maybe by herself, but it will happen. It will come to light that you knew all along. Enjoy the high road while it lasts - it will not be enough to save you from the hole you\u2019re digging yourself.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami snatches up her mask and leaves, focussing on a memory of Marinette laughing to keep black butterflies away.\n\n\nTo say Marinette was surprised to see Apollo and Chloe at her kitchen table that morning was an understatement.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMorning, Nette!\u201d Apollo chirped, happily snacking on the pastries that her parents had presumably provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe need to talk, Marinette,\u201d Chloe said, and Marinette would have been worried by the tone if not for the teasing grin on her face, \u201cabout you and Kagami.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAbout me and Marinette?\u201d Kagami asks, bewildered.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAllegra and Claude nodded in unison, sprawled on her bed as if they\u2019d been there all along and hadn\u2019t barged in five minutes prior. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat about us?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWelllll\u2026..\u201d Claude draws out the word, eyes bright, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the way you look at her, K! Annnnnnd we\u2019ve seen the way she acts around you..\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami \n\ntsks\n\n and nudges Claude into a position more befitting of a human being.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know my feelings for Marinette. You do not need to question me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAllegra pouts, and Kagami sighs. Clearly they want her to elaborate, though if she\u2019s being completely honest with herself, Kagami never needed a reason to talk about Marinette.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c..Fine,\u201d She relents, and Claude throws his arms up in victory, \u201cMarinette is.. many things. She is sweet, and kind, giving me a second chance as easily as she did after how callously I acted. She is brave, and courageous - did she ever tell you how she managed to keep an akuma from reaching her, her first day at our school?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAllegra and Claude gawk at her, and she instantly knows she\u2019s not seen the last of \n\nthat\n\n particular incident.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShe is talented, and quite pretty, to boot. Just because I have not won her over yet, does not mean I do not ever intend to. I never hesitate, but it is more difficult when I do not know how she feels about me.. Or about girls in general.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you need to worry about that, Kagami.\u201d Allegra\u2019s eyes twinkle as she stares down at her phone, a text from Apollo on the screen.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSpace Cadet: Marinette\u2019s been repeating \u201cI have a crush on Kagami\u201d for five minutes over and over\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAllegra: Isn\u2019t that good?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSpace Cadet: It is. :-P I wish you\u2019d have seen her talk herself through it, it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s been thinking about it, comparing it to crushes she\u2019s had before.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSpace Cadet: So how\u2019s Kagami?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAllegra: Claude is offering to \u201cpurposely look bad\u201d at fencing so that K can impress Marinette.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSpace Cadet: Kagami could kick his ass any day of the week, what\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAllegra chuckles, and slips back into the conversation.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 are you going to tell your parents?\u201d Apollo asks, lounging on the chaise.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey sort of already know. Papa said Kagami\u2019d be a lovely addition to the family. Maman was quieter about it, \u00a0but said Kagami seemed sweet, and if I was happy, then so was she.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI suppose it may have been a little obvious, considering you\u2019ve replaced all those photos of Adrien with ones of Kagami~\u201d Chloe grins as Marinette shot her a betrayed look.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nGroup \n\nphotos, Chloe, \n\ngroup photos. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference!\u201d She pouts.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s still strange to her, Marinette thinks, having Chloe around like this. Then again, her life had gone down several twists she never thought she\u2019d take, and having Chloe Bourgeois was actually one of the least shocking.\n\n\u00a0\n\nQuestioning when she\u2019d crossed the line from a crush into somewhat of an obsession had been one of the most, but she was glad she had realised. The schedule, the gifts, the photos in every crevice of her room\u2026 It was embarrassing to think about, now, but it had been the reason behind why Marinette had been so confused about Kagami.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami was pretty. After dealing with Adrien\u2019s passive nature, the fire in her soul was refreshing, and she couldn\u2019t deny the warmth in her heart whenever she did something to make the girl smile.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut it had felt nothing like how she had felt about Adrien, which given recent circumstances she wasn\u2019t even sure how she felt about him now. \u00a0Though, as Chloe had pointed out, she never really knew Adrien. Not really.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd that was the difference, she had realized. Adrien was nice, she knew that, but time and circumstance meant they never got to really get to know each other. He was almost unobtainable, and besides, the level she\u2019d gotten to was \u201cutterly unhealthy\u201d.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe understood far better now. \n\n\u00a0\n\nShe had loved Adrien. But an idea - the perfect Sunshine Boy. It had taken Lila for Marinette to spot the cracks in her own facade, and after that everything had crumbled.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd yes, Kagami had flaws. Of course, she did. Marinette wasn\u2019t going to make the mistake of putting someone on a pedestal like \n\nhim\n\n ever again. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBut she loved her anyway. The girl who turned away slightly when Apollo or Claude dropped in with a terrible pun, so that nobody could see she was hiding a wry smile, unwilling to give either of them the satisfaction of her laughter. The girl whose eyes shone fierce with determination, no matter what. The girl who fought hard for her friends. Who ran a hand through her hair whenever she was frustrated in class. Whose reputation as the Ice Queen was wholly undeserved, because she was warm and kind to those who bothered to get to know her.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd she did actually know her. That was the difference.\n\u00a0\n\nApollo snapped his fingers in front of her face, startling her.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHello? Earth to Mari? Chloe and I have to go.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh! Sorry, yeah, right\u2026 Got distracted a little..yep..\u201d She trails off, painfully aware of the redness on her cheeks and the knowing grins from her friends.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe walks her friends through the bakery and out to their cars. Her phone buzzes as they pull away, and she can\u2019t help but smile as she saw what was on the screen.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n[Message from \u2018Kagami &lt;3\u2019]\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\nDinner was a quiet affair at the Tsurugi household that evening. Claude and Allegra had left a few hours prior. Kagami glanced at her mother, poised as usual, and sighed. It was as good a time as any.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMother. There\u2019s a girl at my school that I-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou wish to court, yes?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nShocked, Kagami looked at her mother to see her send a small smirk in her direction.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYour friend Claude, quite loud isn\u2019t he? Tell me, do you think this girl is a good fit for our family?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI do. Marinette is very capable and I am very fond of her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTomoe Tsurugi hummed, and after a few moments spoke up.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI would like to meet this Marinette. Invite her to next week\u2019s fencing tournament, with the D\u2019Argencourt Academy. If she cannot attend, find out her availability and I shall clear a spot.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, mother.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami smiled, and returned to her dinner. Today was shaping out quite nicely, after all.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYour fencing competition? Yeah, dude, you know I\u2019ll be there!\u201d Nino grinned and slung an arm around Adrien\u2019s shoulder, \u201cYou coming too, Al?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cComing to what, guys?\u201d Lila cuts off Alya\u2019s response, sidling up far too close for comfort to Adrien.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdrien sees a shadow of \n\nsomething\n\n flicker across Alya\u2019s face when Lila appears, but it\u2019s gone as quickly as it appears, and he writes it off.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAdrien\u2019s fencing team\u2019s got a competition next week, you coming along Lila?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nLila grins.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh! I\u2019d love to, thanks!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdrien smiles politely, and the four said their goodbyes and went their separate ways. Adrien settled into the back of his car, tuning out Nathalie\u2019s explanation of that afternoon\u2019s photo shoot.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis day had been good, and his friends were coming to support his tournament.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nAdrien slipped his mask over his face with a sigh.\n\u00a0\nKagami was still avoiding him, and her sudden iciness had not gone unnoticed by the rest of the team. Worse still, it seemed to have spread, as the others seemed to have been shorter and shorter with him recently.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe stepped out of the changing room and moved towards the side of the makeshift arena, waiting for the competition and the teams to be introduced, and looked around the stadium.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNo sign of his father, of course. But he could see Nino, and Alya, and Lila towards the side. If he looked up at the center, at the very top of the rows, he could see Kagami\u2019s mother, a few other students that he believed attended her school, Marinette happily chatting away with what looked like a banner in her hands, a few other family members of his fellow fencers-\n\u00a0\nWait.\n\u00a0\nMarinette?\n\u00a0\nBefore he could wonder what she was doing sitting with Kagami\u2019s party, D\u2019Argencourt put a hand on his shoulder and beckoned him forward. Time for the first match.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKagami smiled, placing her mask carefully inside of her locker, before stepping out into the entrance hall. Allegra waved her down from where she, Claude, Apollo, Marinette and her mother stood, engrossed in conversation.\n\u00a0\nMarinette noticed her approach, and immediately turned to her, her banner now poking out from her bag, beaming widely.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKagami! You were incredible!\u201d\n\u00a0\nTo her immense surprise, her mother nodded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, Kagami. Your technique was impeccable. Slow to strike in your fourth bout, but nonetheless acceptable.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, mother.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs Marinette turned slightly to respond to Claude, Tomoe leant closer to Kagami, dropping her voice so that she couldn\u2019t be overheard.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis Marinette is a good fit. You may court her.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKagami\u2019s smile grew wider, nodding and stepping forward to place a hand on Marinette\u2019s shoulder, who looked back at her and smiled. She resolutely ignored Apollo\u2019s teasing smirk, and rolled her eyes at Claude\u2019s snicker.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMarinette, that banner, it\u2019s incred-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Marinette!\u201d\n\u00a0\nKagami didn\u2019t need to look at the shock and anger in Marinette\u2019s eyes to know who had arrived. Yet she turned anyway.\n\u00a0\nLila Rossi. The lying wretch that had caused someone dear to her so much grief. She stood with Alya and Nino - she noted that the former looked almost forlornly at Marinette, but she dismissed it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was too late for the girl to have opened her eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFriend of yours, \u2018Nette?\u201d Claude asked, subtly moving to stand just ahead of Marinette, placing himself between the two girls.\n\u00a0\nMarinette didn\u2019t answer, or perhaps she would have, but Adrien, fool that he was, ran up at that point, and Lila immediately threw herself at him. Kagami\u2019s lip curled in disgust, and she met her mother's eye, nodding at her questioning glance. Tomoe\u2019s eyes narrowed. She had heard of Lila from Kagami, and knew what she had done.\nShe scowled, tuning back into the conversation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was so upset to hear you had left you know, Mari.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d Marinette snapped, eyes narrowed, scoffing almost inaudibly at Lila\u2019s faked cries.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy not? I thought you were so nice, Marinette, but then you became so mean to us and then you just left instead of making anything better or apologising for what you did!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKagami noticed Alya flinch again, but she aggravatingly did not interject.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHuh, it seemed Adrien was not the only one complacent in the girl\u2019s lies.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKagami moved to stand before them, looking the liar in the eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTake your lies elsewhere, they are not wanted here.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe ignored the girl\u2019s pitiful attempts at rebuttal, turning to place a gentle hand on Marinette\u2019s shoulder.\n\u00a0\nTurning her back on the enemy was a mistake.\n\u00a0\nLila pretended to trip, stumbling towards the pair. Taken unaware, Marinette yelped when Lila fell against her, and Kagami slipped an arm around her waist to keep her steady. She fought a blush rising at having the girl so close, until Lila stepped back, paper in her hands.\n\u00a0\nWait.\n\u00a0\nPaper?\n\u00a0\nMarinette came to a realisation as quickly as Kagami did, only a quick glance down at her bag necessary to confirm it. Lila had used her fall as a cover.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLila spouted her false apologies, but all Kagami could do was stare at the scraps of the banner Marinette had worked so hard on in the liar\u2019s filthy hands.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer hands clenched, her breathing getting shallower.\u00a0 She picked up a strand of the paper, a carefully designed  K  visible in the scrap. Marinette had made that for  her . She had worked so hard on it, she had poured her heart and soul into it.\n\u00a0\nThe  nerve of that brat!\n\u00a0\n\n The nerve, indeed. D\u00e9fenseure, I am Hawkmoth. I will help you defend the one you love from the liar who continues to hurt her.. \n\n\u00a0\nShe was vaguely aware of Marinette calling out for her, even as she accepted Hawkmoth\u2019s proposition.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer voice was the last thing she heard before everything went dark.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cPound it!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChat waved as Ladybug swung away, the last dot beeping precariously on her earrings. He turned to Kagami, offering a hand to help her stand.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, Chat Noir.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe nods, brings her to the entrance of the stadium and disappears over the roof, landing in a back alley.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClaws in\u201d He breathes, and detransforms.\n\u00a0\nPlagg doesn\u2019t say anything, zipping into his jacket for cheese.\n\u00a0\nPlagg doesn\u2019t say anything much, lately.\n\u00a0\nHe returns to the entrance of the stadium, watching Kagami rejoin her friends, Marinette among them. Marinette wrapped Kagami in a hug, and he felt a pang of sadness as she and the others left, Allegra handing Kagami\u2019s equipment to her.\n\u00a0\nMarinette met his eyes as he stepped forward, and the smile on her face was quickly replaced by a small frown, before looking away, Kagami slipping an arm around her waist.\n\u00a0\nThe group ignore him as they pass, though the other girl looks at him disdainfully as she walks.\n\u00a0\nThe pain in his chest lingers, even as Nino wraps him in a hug, even as dinner passes, as night falls and he\u2019s pacing in his room, wondering when everything changed so suddenly.\n\u00a0\nWondering whether he had been right.\n\u00a0\nHe stops at the window, and looks out in the direction he knows Marinette\u2019s bakery is.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlagg, claws out!\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe lands on her balcony, knocking on her trapdoor to alert her, sketching something on her chaise.\n\u00a0\nHer head pops out a moment later.\n\u00a0\n\u201cChat? Is everything okay? Is there another akuma?\u201d\n \u201cJust wanted to see my  fur vorite civilian,\u201d He grins, striking a dramatic pose on her railing, \u201cWould you be so kind as to let this alley cat in?\u201d\nMarinette rolled her eyes, but let him in anyway, saying something about snacks from the bakery and disappearing through her trapdoor.\n\u00a0\nHer room was a lot different than he remembered. There were no more photos of him, for one. Anywhere. There were still photos though, and looking at the collection on the wall, he noted that Kagami featured in a lot. There was a large message board on one wall that he couldn\u2019t recall seeing, full of loose sheets of designs and fabric scraps, scribbled notes and reminders.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOk, I\u2019m back! I got some leftovers from the bakery, if you want some?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMarinette smiled and offered him a croissant, laughing at the gleam in his eye as he gladly took it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNoticed you redecorated, Princess, what happened with that boy? Anyone I need to deal with?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMarinette started, but she smiled and shook her head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no, Chat. I\u2019m in a much better place now. I was\u2026 having a lot of trouble at my old school, but you don\u2019t need to hear about a civilian\u2019s problems.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTry me? I\u2019m a  pur ety good listener,\u201d He winked, \u201cI thought you had a lot of friends at school?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI  did , but then this new girl, she came with all these fantastical lies\u2026 When I tried to expose her, she threatened me, and then she made good on her threat. I lost all my friends, they started bullying me, and my crush? Adrien knew too, see,\u201d She lets out a bitter laugh, the smile on her face slipping into a frown, \u201cHe knew, but he didn\u2019t see a problem with it. These weren\u2019t white lies, Chat, she was faking disabilities and using it to take advantage of people, getting them to do her work, carry her things. I couldn\u2019t stand by and let my friends be manipulated, but I guess they weren\u2019t really my friends in the end. Adrien said we were in it together, but he never stood up for me. I know he doesn\u2019t have the best home life, but it would\u2019ve been nice to actually have a friend at DuPont. A real one. I stopped loving him after that, and transferred over summer.\u201d\n\u00a0\nChat was struck silent. Eventually, he hugged her, not sure of what else to do.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Princess.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t be, Chat, it\u2019s not like you were there.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you happier now?\u201d He asks, feeling himself relax as a real smile returned to Marinette\u2019s face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am, I really am. I have a great new school, wonderful new friends, and there\u2019s Kagami too..\u201d She trails off, blushing furiously.\n\u00a0\nHe can\u2019t help himself, a teasing grin on his face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh? Does the princess have a new crush?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cStop it, you,\u201d She snickers, pushing him away, \u201cShe\u2019s incredible. We got off on a rough foot way back when we first met, but we were able to make a fresh start when I transferred, and ever since we\u2019ve been really close. She\u2019s amazing, Chat, she\u2019s so confident, and that Ice Queen reputation of hers is just a mask, she\u2019s so sweet, and she\u2019s a great fencer\u2026\u201d She continues to wax poetic about Kagami, and Chat smiles despite himself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe sounded just like Ladybug. Ladybug had had similar issues in love, he\u2019d heard about it from patrol, but had met a girl that seemed like a far nicer fit. He was happy for her, and had gladly offered to Cataclysm the first boy who had broken her heart. Sure, he loved her, but more than anything he was her friend, and partner. Plagg had really opened his eyes about that, back when they were still talking.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s getting close to midnight when Marinette yawns, and he decides to head home, smiling apologetically.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry, Purrrincess, but this alley cat has a city to patrol. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing so much better now, and I hope you have more luck in love this time around!\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith a wave and a smile, he leapt off her balcony and into the night.\n\u00a0\nThe smile slips as soon as she can no longer see him.\n\n\u201cAllegra, you are \n\nnot\n\n helping!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nStifling a laugh, Allegra dodges the shirt chucked at her, and holds out a discarded jacket.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow about this?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette turns, taking the jacket and glancing over it with a critical eye, before shaking her head vehemently and dropping it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCalm down, Nette, it\u2019s a bistro, not a five star restaurant! Besides, Kagami will love whatever you wear.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette groaned, flopping onto her chaise.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMarinette?\u201d Her mother raps gently on the door, \u201cKagami\u2019s waiting downstairs, sweetheart.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAllegra could only watch in disbelief as Marinette shrieked in surprise, grabbed an armful of clothes and disappeared through the door. She heard the slam of the bathroom door and shook her head, deciding to meet Kagami downstairs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom was in the middle of engaging a very startled looking Kagami in conversation on Japanese pastries, whilst Sabine muffled a laugh behind one hand, and placed the other on her husband\u2019s back.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTom, dear, we talked about this.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe laughed, stepping back, and allowing Sabine to admire the bouquet of azaleas and roses clutched in Kagami\u2019s hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d Marinette scrambled down the stairs, skidding to a stop just past the bakery counter.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami smiled, offering Marinette the bouquet.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThese reminded me of you,\u201d She said, a fond lilt to her voice, \u201cthough I should have known that even the best of flowers would pale in comparison to you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShe\u2019s going to kill me..\n\n Marinette thought, painfully aware of her parents cooing behind her.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTen minutes of her parents taking photos and fussing over the pair passed before Kagami\u2019s driver came inside.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to intrude, but it is coming close to your reservation, Miss Kagami.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette quickly waved goodbye to her parents and dragged Kagami outside.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be back too late!\u201d Her father yelled as the door shut.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nKagami held the door open for Marinette to pass through, the host\u2019s cheerful goodbye echoing into the night behind them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t too late yet,\u201d Marinette mused, glancing up at the sky and then down at a notification on her phone, \u201cAndre\u2019s been spotted nearby at the Seine, want to see if we can catch up with him?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe nods, sending a text to her driver with the change of plans. She doesn\u2019t bother hiding the smile on her face when Marinette slips her hand in hers and pulls her along.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAndre is cheerful, calling out to the two with a gusto Kagami wasn\u2019t sure anyone could sincerely have. His eyes sparkle when he sees their clasped hands, and he turns to Marinette with a twirl.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDear Marinette! Such a sweet new love! Wonderful, just wonderful! Tell me, who is this that helped you find that love in your eyes? \u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is Kagami,\u201d Marinette smiles at Andre, who beams and produces two cones from his cart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA pleasure to meet you, Kagami! And just for the two of you, an ice cream as sweet as your new found love! Chocolate, strawberry and white nougat! Enjoy!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAndre waves them across the bridge, and Kagami regretfully pulls her hand from Marinette\u2019s to eat her ice cream before it melts.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo, he just doesn\u2019t charge people for this?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNot that I know of,\u201d Marinette shrugs, \u201cHe\u2019s got a whole thing about miracle love finding ice cream, I think it\u2019d lose the magic if he charged people for it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice, but I don\u2019t think I need an ice cream to tell me I love you.\u201d Kagami smirks, and even so it takes her a minute to realise Marinette is stood as still as a statue, her face aflame and her mouth dropped open.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA small ball of worry curdles in her gut when the girl goes one, three, five minutes without moving an inch, and she steps forward, slipping one hand onto her shoulder and the other underneath her chin.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe contact seemed to jolt her back to life, and she buried her face in her hands, an almost hysterical sounding giggle escaping.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cY-you, you can\u2019t just \n\nsay\n\n things like that! You, you..\u201d She trails off, and finally, \n\nfinally\n\n, looks Kagami in the eyes, and the raw vulnerability in her eyes squeezes around her heart like a vice, \u201c..did you mean it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEvery word. You\u2019re wonderful, Marinette. You\u2019re bright, and kind, and beautiful. I would have to be truly oblivious to not see you. To not see you and love you as you deserve to be.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI don\u2019t know how he didn\u2019t\n\n, she thinks, but she keeps that to herself.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHer declaration works though - Marinette smiles, and takes Kagami\u2019s hand in both of her own.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI.. I see you, too, Kagami.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe true words may go unspoken, a stammering staccato in her head no doubt, but Kagami sees them in her eyes as clearly as the morning sky.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette floats into school the following morning, Allegra and Claude pressing for every detail. Her phone chimes, and Claude instantly perks up and peers over her shoulder when she tells them its from Kagami.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKagami &lt;3: Shall I assume Claude and Allegra are as keen for details as Apollo is?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette: Yes! :D\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette: Oh! Claude wants you to know he\u2019s getting all the details from you after school at fencing!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKagami &lt;3: Good.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette: ?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKagami &lt;3: He\u2019ll be easier to beat when he\u2019s distracted.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKagami &lt;3: Join me for lunch? X\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMarinette: Sure! Meet me by the art room? Xx\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKagami &lt;3: Of course.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFor the new power couple!\u201d Claude cries, pressing a fist against his chest in a mock salute and bowing dramatically, spilling out of his seat just as their teacher arrives.\n\n\u00a0\n\nClasses pass normally enough until they reach the art room. Claude had dragged both Allegra and Marinette over to a corner to discuss his latest project when an angry yell bursts suddenly from the front of the room. Two students, stand face to face. She recognises one, Matthew, she thinks, a fellow art student who loved abstract art above all else. Matthew looks furiously at the other student, who simply shrugs and walks away. Allegra tried to calm him, but he slapped her hand away and stalked from the classroom as the bell rang.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette slips out of the classroom, leaning against Kagami with a sigh.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat was he so angry about?\u201d She asks, and Marinette shrugs.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear, Claude was telling us about this new mask he\u2019s designing and then-\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nA scream cuts her off, and she looks to the top of the stairs to see -\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMatthew?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNot anymore.\u201d The akuma said, gesturing to his patchwork outfit, \u201cI am Abstraction! You think you can insult my passion! You think the Louvre does not respect me? I\u2019ll show you respect!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMatthew!\u201d The student from before darts out \u201cI was kidding, man! Come on, please!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI am \nAbstraction!\n\u201d He snarls, darting forward and flicking a multicoloured ball in his direction\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen the dust clears, her classmate is frozen in place, his body contorted.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAll of Paris will become the canvas for my abstract beauty!\u201d The akuma crows, darting through the doors and out into Paris.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTime to transform, just gotta sneak away!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nBefore she can even think of an excuse, Kagami grabs her arm tightly and takes off further into the school.\n\n\nShe sees Tikki send a concerned glance toward the transformed student as they\u2019re dragged farther away.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami stops just as suddenly as she started, and pushes Marinette into an empty classroom with one window already ajar.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d She says, sounding satisfied, \u201cThis should be a safe place for you to transform.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette tries to stammer out an excuse, but Kagami simply raises an eyebrow.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow.. How did you know?\u201d She asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs I said before, Marinette,\u201d  Kagami smiles, cupping her face in her hands, \u201cIt is impossible for me to not see you. In or out of the suit. Now, go. Paris needs you. And if you need Kasai, I shall remain here until you return.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette nods, calling on her transformation. Emboldened, as she often is with a mask, she presses a kiss to Kagami\u2019s cheek, and flies through the window towards the Louvre.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChat crashes into her halfway there.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhoops, sorry Ladybug! Abstraction is at the Louvre. He can do something strange with the people he turns into paintings, they play with your eyes,\u201d He holds up his hand, two paw pads bright on his ring, \u201cI need to recharge, but I think we could use a hand, or two!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood thinking, kitty. Recharge and meet me behind the Louvre, I\u2019ll get our team!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWaving off her partner, she changes course.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe\u2019s in and out of the massage parlour and back to the school in less than fifteen minutes, Fox and Dragon in hand. She tracks down Allegra first, and Melody hops up to wait on the roof while she swings back into the classroom Kagami was in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFreshly transformed, Kasai leaps from the window behind her and lands on the roof beside Melody.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAll right guys. Let\u2019s go find Chat and defeat Abstraction!\u201d\n\n\nThe Miraculous Team land on the roof of the Louvre, Melodie leaning over the side to assess the damage.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s \u2026 a \n\nlot\n\n of people contorted, faces drawn in pain. One spots the heroes as they descend, and points towards the doors. Chat Noir sends him a grateful smile and the team slip through the door.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow do we find the Akuma?\u201d Kasai whispers, brow furrowing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe second she closes her mouth a group of screams ring out from a nearby exhibit, and the team rush through the entryway and hide behind a display, peeking over to see the Akuma standing in front of a group of students.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarinette\u2019s old class.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s been long enough since she\u2019s seen them that seeing them again is like a punch to the gut. Lila is front and centre, stammering when the Akuma demands she brings Ladybug to her.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nM\u00e9lodie taps Ladybug\u2019s shoulder, and places her flute to her lips.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nMirage\n\n\u201d She whispers, and a series of abstract paintings materialise. She whips them at Abstraction, who dodges just in time and tries to hit them out of the air.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAbstraction is frantic, twisting and turning and it\u2019s then Ladybug catches a glimpse of a ball of paper clutched in one hand. The Akuma.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe whispers quickly to Kasai and Chat, Melodie still successfully distracting Abstraction.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nInferno!\u201d \n\nKasai yells, and leaps at the Akuma, sword already ablaze. Abstraction yelps and jumps, the paper falling from his hand. He scrambles for it but Kasai is quicker, snatching it up and throwing it into Chat\u2019s waiting Cataclysm.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nLadybug steps up, purifies the Akuma and casts her Cure, catching that attention of the class who cheer and clap.\n\n\u00a0\n\nActions that abruptly end when Melodie stand behind her.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c.. Huh?\u201d Rose is the first to speak, eyes wide in confusion.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe look is mirrored on Ladybug\u2019s face. Melodie had been all over the news since she started out, surely the class had heard?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid you .. did you \n\nlie\n\n to us?\u201d Myl\u00e9ne says next, and she\u2019s talking to \n\nLila\n\n, Ladybug realises, Lila who looks like she\u2019s trying to figure out how to spin this.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s Alya who steps up to Ladybug.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLadybug, Lila told us all \n\nshe\n\n was Melodie, because you were friends..\u201d Her explanation trails off after Melodie lets out a sharp scoff.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMelodie is not Lila. Lila has never held a Miraculous. We are not friends. It would be far too dangerous for Ladybug to have civilian friends and even if I did, I would expect them not to spread that information in case they catch Hawkmoth\u2019s attention.\u201d She\u2019s thankful her tone isn\u2019t cold, but it\u2019s enough for the class to look towards Lila with betrayal in their eyes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll except Alya, it seems, who just looks down at her phone as if she\u2019s received confirmation of something she desperately didn\u2019t want to be true.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe doesn\u2019t get time to think more on that though - Melodie is down to two minutes and the rest of them aren\u2019t too far behind. She picks up the freed student and waves to the class.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry, but we really have to go. Bug out!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe leaves just as they start yelling.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChat leaps away with a wave, and the three of them get close enough to their school before Kasai drops into an alley and Melodie stops on a rooftop as they detransform. Ladybug safely sees the boy to the steps of the school - noticing last minute Claude and Apollo are standing together near the bottom, and doubles back. Allegra hands over the Fox with a grin before Ladybug helps her down, watching her run off towards the school before she lands in the alley next to Kagami, detransforming as well.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow are you feeling\u201d Kagami asks, taking her hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know,\u201d She murmurs, leaning into her girlfriend\u2019s touch, \u201cI guess, maybe, I thought that I would be happier when the class found out the truth about Lila. It\u2019s not as cathartic as I thought it would be. They\u2019re not being manipulated anymore, but..\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t change what they did to you.\u201d Kagami finishes and Marinette closes her eyes, Tikki providing her own small comfort in the crook of her neck.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c.. No, I guess not. Maybe one day. It depends, I think, if they come to see me, to apologise. Maybe in a letter though - I\u2019ll tell my parents that I\u2019ll allow that - I don\u2019t think I can see them yet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf they are truly sorry, they will understand.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKagami presses a kiss to her forehead, and they step out of the alley hand in hand.\n\n\u00a0"
