    "text": "\n\u201cHey Mister Stark, so I\u2019ve got some homework and I was hop-\u201d I cut off \nabruptly\n. Sitting in the middle of the polished granite kitchen of Tony Stark is the runaway Avengers. Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bucky Barnes, Clint Barton, and Sam Wilson. Strewn about, they look familiar with the space, but still \nslightly\n unused to it. I suppose months away does that. \u201cYou\u2019re not Mister Stark?\u201d I say, \nslightly\n awe-struck.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo. We\u2019re not.\u201d Natasha says \ndryly\n, eyeing me up and down from her place perched on top of the counter.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSince when does Stark have a kid?\u201d Clint kicks his legs on top of the table. Steve tuts at him, looking up from the newspaper and swatting at his legs.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe doesn't.\u201d Black Widow says. On second thought, \u201cdoes he?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe doesn't.\u201d The new voice is dry, unamused. All the heads turn to Tony. \nHe's standing at the other entrance, carrying a stack of steaming pizza boxes with a tray of Starbuck cups balanced on top\n. Tony sets down the towering stack of pizza boxes on the table. \u201cNo! \nHonestly\n, I leave for five minutes to get the pizza and you think I\u2019ve got a child?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTo be fair, this random kid \njust\n shows up, asking for homework help, what were we supposed to think?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think you would\u2019ve noticed if I had a kid around the last sixteen years?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt would be the first thing you\u2019ve kept from us..\u201d Natasha says, slurping her steaming coffee.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony crossed his arms. \u201cYeah? What?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUltron, for one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat was-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nInterrupting the budding argument, I ask: \u201cHey, can I have some coffee?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony and Natasha look up, her eyeing me \ndubiously\n. \u201cNo.\u201d Tony refuses.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d I whine.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s bad for you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou drink it all the time!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a developing brain.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMr. Stark raises an eyebrow at me. \n\n\u00a0\n\nI fall silent, grumbling, \u201cfine.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nMr. Stark turns away, reaching to grab a slice of pizza. This is my chance. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIn a sudden flurry of motion I vault over the granite countertop, grabbing Mr. Stark's steaming black coffee and dashing into the lounge\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey! Peter!\u201d comes Mr. Stark's outraged voice, I laugh, taking a long chug of his drink.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s hot coffee.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLike \nreally\n hot.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI gasp, spluttering coffee over the carpet. \u201cOw! I burnt my tongue,\u201d I mumble \nthickly\n, sticking the offending organ out.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cServes you right,\u201d comes a cool voice from the door.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMrrr Stttaaarrrkkk,\u201d I gripe.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFine. Come in, and drink some ice-water.\u201d he relents.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI wander back into the kitchen, where the Avengers seem to be in a deep debate.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSeriously, did Tony just pick him up, or just find out about him...?\u201d Steve wonders.\n\n\u00a0\n\nClint: \u201cHe did have a few wild years,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSam: \"How long ago was that? How old is the kid anyway?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve: \u201c16.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNatasha, with a thoughtful look back and a click of her tongue: \u201cEh, possible.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBucky, throwing a look at Steve: \u201cHe already said it\u2019s not his kid.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nNatasha, snorting: \u201csure he isn\u2019t. Have you seen the way they look at each other?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nClint: \u201cDefinitely some father/son bonding there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Jesus! Again!\u201d Tony interrupts, throwing up his hands.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2018You can\u2019t \njust\n spring this shit on us!\u201d Sam protests.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSure I can. He's. Not. My. Biological. Child. Can you get that though your heads?\u201d he spells out.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMs. Romanoff looks down into her coffee and whispers, \n\n\u201cbiological.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony ignores the comment, filling up a glass of water and dropping a few ice cubes in. They clink against the sides of the glass \nintermittently\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks, Mr. Stark.\u201d I take the glass.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter some more whispered arguing, Bucky bites the bullet. \u201cWho is this kid?\u201d he \u00a0crosses his arms, one of them shiny and silver. Okay, I need to ask about that.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMr. Stark takes a deep breath, \u201cGuys, meet Spiderman.\u201d he says \nheavily\n, I wave a little, sipping Mr. Stark\u2019s coffee. Then wincing, yeah, not the best thing to do with a burnt tongue.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s Spiderman?\u201d Steve (aka CAPTAIN, FREAKING, AMERICA) says \nincredulously\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony nods, \u201cthat's what I said.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSam squawks, \u201cHe\u2019s \njust\n a kid!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d I inject.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony spares a glance at me, \u201cI know, I know\u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nSteve cuts Tony off. \u201cYou brought him to a war-zone! We could have killed him!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTony, he\u2019s not even \nlegally\n an adult!\u201d Clint mouths.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNatasha and Bucky stay in stony silence.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat on earth were you thinking!\u201d Steve yells. That's the final string.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI WASN\u2019T!\u201d Tony roars, he took a few, short, deep pant-like breaths. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking,\u201d he continues, \nslightly\n quieter, calmer now. \n\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking, I know he\u2019s a kid, and \nprobably\n got too much on his plate anyway, and it \nreally\n isn't fair and he shouldn't even have powers and the fact I \ntook advantage of\n him to fight our war is despicable\u2014\u201d The rest of his voice blurs out before it gets to my ears\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s it, I can\u2019t handle it anymore. Spiderman was my choice. Sure, \nmaybe\n Mr. Stark shouldn\u2019t have taken me to Berlin, but I would have gotten into equal amounts of trouble here. I \n\ndid \n\nget into a equal amount of trouble here. The Vulture dropped a building on me for god\u2019s sake!\n\n\u00a0\n\nI kick off my shoes, stripping off my socks. My feet are cold on the tiles. I slam down my glass, making the water splash over the sides. Tony turns and attention \nis diverted\n to me. Spinning on my heel, I take off towards the wall, bare feet finding the edge between the tiles and paint \neasily\n. And then I\u2019m vertical, climbing the wall with ease and speed. I clamber across the ceiling, opening the already unscrewed vent and disappearing inside.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Peter!\" Mr. Stark calls after me and then everything is quiet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cool air of the vents greets me. I shuffle forward on my hands and knees, the grille swinging open behind me.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI like the vents. They're cool and silent and lonely. Someplace to think. Sometimes it\u2019s a tight squeeze, but I deal with it. The tunnels run all around the tower. Sometime \nI wonder\n if they \nwere made\n so large on purpose, or if it\u2019s only a coincidence.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI keep shuffling forward, the familiar twist and turns of the maze before me. I'm up here a lot. I discovered the network when playing hide-and-seek, \noddly\n enough. It takes a lot of persuading, and Mr. Stark pretty much \njust\n counts to 30 and then got F.R.I.D.A.Y to tell him where I am. But it\u2019s nice that he even pretends.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI'm \nnearly\n to my room when I hear grunting ahead. Freezing, I shy away from the noise, yet curious to who it is.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJesus, when...did..these dam vents...get so tight?\u201d Then a muttering of Russian expletives.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI crawl forward to see a half-in, half-out Natasha Romanoff. bn her head bobs \noddly\n as she struggles through the vents.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\u0411\u043b\u044f\u0434\u044c!\u201d She shrieks. Her foot kicks back and I can hear the chair she\u2019s balancing on clang to the floor.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask, concerned.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah. I wanted to see if you were alright,\u201d she pants, pulling herself up. I reach out a hand, helping her.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re \njust\n a kid.\u201d she shrugs. She tries to compose herself, huffing a clump of hair out of her face. \u201cAnd I do have a maternal side, no matter how much I hide it.\u201d she rolls her eyes, easing of of the sudden awkwardness away. \n\n\u00a0\n\nI blush \ndarkly\n, \u201cI\u2019m not a kid!\u201d I repeat.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe raises her eyebrows \nseriously\n, \u201cYou kinda are.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI growl. \u201cFine. But no more, it\u2019s bad enough Mr. Stark calls me Underoos.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNatasha\u2019s eyebrows raise up to her hairline, \u201che calls you Underoos?\u201d she repeats, crazy grin spreading over her face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo..\u201d I mumble, blushing again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe does! Oh my god, Clint is going to die when he hears that!\u201d she laughs,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo! Please don\u2019t tell Mr. Barton!\u201d I protest.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, I won\u2019t,\u201d she pauses dramatically, a devilish grin spreading over her face. \u201cBut, you owe me a favor.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDeal, but-\u201d I am \nunknowingly\n cut off by the recognizable voice of Tony Stark.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNat!\u201d he raps on the door.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI motion a wild\n\n \u2018move\u2019\n\n gesture at her, and she drops to the ground, right as Mr. Stark walks in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere's a pause, then, \u201cwhy were you on the ceiling?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI lost my earring.\u201d she lies \neasily\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI can \npractically\n hear his suspicion, but \napparently\n it\u2019s not strange enough an event to warrant investigation\n. That itself speaks volumes. \u201cOkay, whatever, I need to talk to you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d Natasha asks, I shuffle forward as \nquietly\n as I can, peering down into the room. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter. He\u2019s \njust\n a kid, and I need you guys to go easy on him. Okay?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNatasha raises an eyebrow. \u201cWhat qualifies as \u2018go easy on\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo murdering\u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s immediately cut off by Nat, \u201cNo murdering Peter or people around Peter?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe sighs, rubbing a hand over his forehead, \u201cthe fact that you even have to ask\u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe groans, \u201c\nJust\n tell me which.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBoth.\u201d he fixes her with a stare.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay, I got it. Go on.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSecond, no mentally scarring him: no gruesome recounts of past missions, no bad morals, no making out with Clint in plain view\u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat!

No anything.\u201d He finishes finally.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy would I pick him up from school?\u201d she inquires, sounding confused. \u201cOr any of that actually.\u201d she adds, as if a second thought.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony raises his eyebrows, \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought, the kid grows on you.\u201d From my vantage point I see Natasha lift her head ever so \nslightly\n, eyes flicking to the vents above where I\u2019m hiding.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah. I can see that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony moves to leave, opening the door and half-stepping out. \u00a0Before he does, he calls out: \u201cI know you\u2019re up there, Peter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a moment of silence, then I stick my head out of the vent, grinning in both a mischievous and apologetic way. \u201cSorry, Mr. Stark,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis eyes \nare masked\n behind iconic yellow ray-bans. \u201cNo problem, kid.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Hap!\u201d I call out at Happy Hogan\u2019s half-visible face though the window, Happy cocks a hand in a wave. I say goodbye to Ned, walking towards the shiny black Audi.\n\u00a0\nI pull open the backseat door, sliding in without a look inside. Turning my head, I am met with a surprise. There, sitting with a\u00a0slightlyawkward look on his face is Steve Rodgers.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?!\u201d I gush, eyes wide and starry at one of my heros, (still got a place in my heart, Iron-Man.)\n\u00a0\nHappy sighs from the front seat, \u201cSorry, kid, he made me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no! This is like a dream!\u201d I fanboy, \u201cohmygod ohmygod ohmygod!\u201d I squeal, each \u2018ohmygod\u2019 rising in pitch. \u201cWhat was it like in the ice? What was it like in the war? What was it like waking up? Ohmygod, what was it like watching TV for the first time??\u201d\n\u00a0\nMr. Rogers sighs,\u00a0obviously\u00a0used to this sort of attention but still\u00a0slightly\u00a0amused. \u201cTony seems to like you, so-\"\n\u00a0\nI cut him off. \"You think?\" I ask\u00a0shyly\u00a0.\n\u00a0\n\"I know,\" Mr. Rodgers reaffirms. \"it's\u00a0honestly\u00a0disturbing, I've never seen the man so\u00a0motherly\u00a0.\"\n\u00a0\nAnyway,\" he resumes, \"I wanted to meet you without Tony peering over my shoulder and threatening to castrate me if I mentally damage you\u00a0.\"\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou mean his rules?\u201d I click in my seatbelt with a snap and Happy pulls away from the curve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d\n\u00a0\nI blush, \u201cI\u00a0totally\u00a0wasn\u2019t hiding in the vents when he told Ms. Romanoff. She\u2019s nice by the way.\u201d I decline to mention the fact I got caught.\n\u00a0\nHe raises his blonde eyebrows, \u201cnice?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPink rises to my cheeks again, \u201cYeah. She found me in the vents after I uh...ran off yesterday.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHuh,\u201d He says, \u201cshe must like you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI like her too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe\u2019s a good friend.\u201d A moment of long, stretched out silence passes. Mr. Rogers clears the quiet with another question, \u201cSo, Spider-Man, huh?\u201d\n\u00a0\nI chuckle, looking down in embarrassment, \u201cYep. I uh\u2026 started swingin\u2019 around Queens and then Mr. Stark found me off YouTube, do you know what YouTube is? Well anyway he made me a new suit, helped me with my web serum.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d He searches for the right word, \u201c...make you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nI splutter, \u201cum, if you\u2019re asking if he\u2019s my dad, he\u2019s not.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no, I gathered that from yesterday. I meant, did he give you powers and make you into Spider-Man?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo. I did that all my myself.\u201d I say\u00a0proudly\u00a0, puffing out my chest besides myself. Steve sees and smirks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow\u2019d you get your powers?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRadioactive spider bit me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat can you do?\u201d Steve asks, sounding\u00a0genuinely\u00a0interested.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can climb walls and ceilings, and I have super strength, which I guess you figured, dropping an airport ramp on me and all\u00a0.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve winces, \u201cSorry about that, by the way.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool. We\u2019re even, I took your shield.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve laughs, \u201cReal underdog, huh? You remind me of someone I used to know.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah? Who?\u201d I ask\u00a0excitedly\u00a0.\n\u00a0\n\u201cA kid from Brooklyn in the forties. Real scrappy, would stand up to anyone, even though he was tiny.\u201d\n\u00a0\nI beam with pride, my phone buzzes in my pocket. I check the screen, it\u2019s Ned:\n\u00a0\n\nSorry about Flash today. He\u2019s a dick, don\u2019t worry about it\n\n\u00a0\nI go to tuck my phone away, intending to reply later.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho\u2019s Flash?\u201d Steve asks, a determination in his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, no one.\u00a0Just\u00a0a kid at school.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe giving you trouble?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no -\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Peter.\u201d\n\u00a0\nI sigh in defeat. \u201cFine. I guess he is, I mean it\u2019s not bad,\u00a0just\u00a0-\u201d Mr. Roger\u2019s cuts off my ramble again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTell me what he does.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe calls me Penis Parker,\u201d I admit.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the best he can come up with you should be bullying him. Anything else?\u201d\n\u00a0\nI sigh again, \u201che makes fun of my parents. You know, how they\u2019re dead. Also, he doesn't believe me about Mr. Stark and my internship,\u00a0just\u00a0teases me, you know? Asks if I\u2019ve met any Avengers yet, that kinda thing.\u00a0Honestly\u00a0it's not a big deal.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoes Tony know about this?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell Mr. Stark!\u201d I bolt out, turning towards the Captain, \u201che can\u2019t know!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d he says suspiciously.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf he finds out he\u2019ll rip Flash\u2019s head off, and I do not need that publicity, and neither does he. I\u00a0just\u00a0know he\u2019ll over-react and walk into school with a marching band, and promise to ruin his life, or something.\u201d I sigh, slumping back in the seat, exhausted.\n\u00a0\n\"What would get him off your back?\" Steve asks, looking thoughtful.\n\u00a0\n\"I dunno.\"\n\u00a0\n\u201cWould Captain America picking you up do the trick?\u201d\n\u00a0\nXxXxXxXxXx\n\u00a0\nI jump down the stairs two at a time, typing in the code to Tony Stark's workshop.

Tony was bragging the other day about how smart you are.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\nJust\n tired.\u201d I give \nnon-committedly\n, flipping through my notes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Clint leans forward, scrutinising the bags under my eyes, \u201cJesus kid, when's the last time you slept?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI shrug my shoulders, \u201cLike...Thursday...\nmaybe\n?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow are you still alive?\u201d He asks, sounding \ngenuinely\n confounded.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRedbull and desperation.\u201d I answer. The toaster pings.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that later,\u201d Clint warns, getting the poptarts. I accept mine \ngratefully\n, biting into the fruity pastry. I groan in holy delight, poptarts will always sway my allegiance. Always.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter a few minutes of contented munching, Mr. Barton clears his throat. \u201cSo, Thursday? It\u2019s Saturday, kid.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTime is \njust\n a construct,\u201d I supply, very \ndeterminedly\n keeping my eyes away from his.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNot that much of a construct.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou cannot define things on \u201chow much of a construct they are\u201d\u201d I say, dropping my air quotes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cStop it, kid. I know you can talk circles around me, but I\u2019m kinda worried.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve \njust\n been so busy, like with school and patrolling and we have Nationals coming up, and then helping Mr. Stark in the lab, and it\u2019s \njust\n so much\n.\u201d I sigh \nexplosively\n, my strings cut.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou need to sleep, superhero or not. You can take a break.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeople need me, Mr. Barton, you may be one of the avengers, but I\u2019m \njust\n a friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man. I stop muggings and bank robberies, not super important shit like you guys.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nClint took a second to respond. \u201cYeah. I get that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo you see? I can\u2019t take a break.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKid,\u201d Clint looked me in the eyes, \u201ceveryone can take a break.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI sigh, \u201cI guess. It\u2019s \njust\n a lot of pressure, you know?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know. But no-one is pressuring you, or expecting you to save the world in recess, okay?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah. But like Mr. Stark made me this whole new suit and flew me out to Germany. And then when my Aunt May was late on rent he paid it and I only know that because of my enhanced hearing. \nI \njust\n feel like he\u2019s helped me so much and I need to repay him, somehow,\u201d I suck in a shuddering breath, tears prickling at the corners of my eyes\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nClint walks around the bench, discarding his half-eaten pop-tart next to mine. \u201cKilling yourself isn\u2019t repaying him. Tony\u2026\u201d Clint looks unsure on how to proceed. \n\u201cI've never seen Tony so \nridiculously\n happy than when he\u2019s around you,\u201d Clint smiles, and I see some of his parental-ness showing though\n. \u201cOr Pepper, but that\u2019s beside the point\u201d he adds. \n\u201cThe point is he loves you, and \nI don't think\n you could do anything short of blowing up the entire tower and he\u2019d still forgive you\n. And even then - you could \nprobably\n get away with that too.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI giggle \nwetly\n, a lone tear slipping down my cheek. I wipe it away \nstubbornly\n. Clint pulls me in for a hug, one of those big, warm, bear hugs where you get swallowed up. He smells like \nfreshly\n mown grass and cologne.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe seperate, \u201cThank you, Clint.\u201d I say \nhonestly\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe smiles back at me, picking up his poptart again, \u201cdon\u2019t mention it, kiddo.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nI groan, throwing back the covers and getting out of bed. I\u2019m staying the weekend with Mr. Stark at SI, Aunt May is out of town and she insisted. I don\u2019t particularly mind, it means I get to work on cool tech everyday.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s been a few weeks since I wandered in on the Avengers. It\u2019s been great ever since, chats with Steve Rogers, Natasha teaching me Russian, movie marathons with Clint. I still can\u2019t believe it.\n\u00a0\nI hang out with the Avengers.\n\u00a0\n\n The Avengers. \n\n\u00a0\nIf Flash knew he would piss his pants.\n\u00a0\nMy geeky bedroom is dark, the only light coming from the the window in silver streams. Mr. Stark kitted it out especially, with a Star Wars duvet, shelves above my bed teeming with lego, and a comfy desk and chair to study on.\n\u00a0\nThe glowing digital clock on my bedside table reads: 4: 21. I pad across the carpet as\u00a0quietly\u00a0as I can, opening the door with only a creak. The rest of the hallway is dark, no-one else is awake - not even Mr. Stark. A heavy, sleepy silence cloaks the tower.\n\u00a0\nI wander down the corridor towards the kitchen, the beige carpet soft under my bare feet. I used to get lost, but after the 5th time getting up in the night I manage my way. But still, the dark maze of hallways and rooms are unnerving.\n\u00a0\nThe rest of the Avengers have\u00a0officially\u00a0moved into the tower - which the press is having a field day with - and everyone's settled into a routine. I come around at least three times a week, and have gotten to know everyone pretty well.\n\u00a0\nI push open the kitchen door, yawning. Stepping inside, I swing open the fridge door.\u00a0Instantly, a cold metal bar wraps across my throat from behind. I gasp, going stiff in surprise. The yellow light from the fridge illuminates a shiny silver arm - not bar.\n\u00a0\nIn an automatic move I claw at the metal that\u2019s squeezing at my windpipe, \u201cWho are you?\u201d the rough, unmistakable voice of Bucky Barnes whispers in my ear.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPe..Peter,\u201d I choke out. The arm around my neck is gone in a instant. I gasp in air, slipping to the cold tiled ground.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry, sorry!\u201d\u00a0he says\u00a0frantically, \u201cI didn\u2019t recognise you,\u201d He sounds regretful,\u00a0genuinely, actually sorry.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Mr. Winter Soldier Bucky Barnes sir,\u201d I ramble, still catching my breath.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHonestly, Peter, I\u2019m sorry. I\u00a0just\u00a0stepped into uh...HYDRA mode, and I\u00a0just\u00a0didn\u2019t think.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot your fault,\u201d I stand up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI..I thought I was getting better,\u201d he mumbles, pushing his hair back from his face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are.\u201d I say confidently.\n\u00a0\nHe looks up sharply, \u201chow would you know that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can hear through walls. Mr. America was talking to Mr. Stark about your improvement.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBeen eavesdropping, have you, kid?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot my fault, I can\u2019t tune it out.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHuh. You\u00a0really\u00a0do have superpowers.\u201d It\u2019s not a question, not a statement either. Somewhere\u00a0in between. He wanders over to the counter, leaning on it\u00a0heavily.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, got bit by a radioactive spider,\" I explain, fiddling with the hem of my T-shirt.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow\u2019d that happen?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cField trip to Oscorp, I\u2019m not sure when it happened, and the next thing I knew I was throwing up in the school bathroom.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOch.\u201d Bucky winces\u00a0sympathetically.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, it was horrible. The first week after the bite I felt like shit. I would pass out, and puke and I was always cold. But it was worth it, my powers I mean.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamn. Sounds tough, kid.\u201d I know he\u2019s\u00a0probably\u00a0just\u00a0humouring me, I mean he was in a war for god's sake, but it still strokes my ego.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWant me to\u00a0demonstrate?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe snorts, \u201cof course.\u201d\n\u00a0\nI step back, clearing a bit of space. Bucky sees what I\u2019m doing and steps back too. I do a backflip, landing on my feet\u00a0perfectly.\u00a0Normally\u00a0that would impress Ned, Aunt May or even Mr. Stark.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat all? I could do that in my sleep,\u201d Bucky teases.\n\u00a0\nI laugh, \u201cI\u2019ll bring out the big guns.\u201d\n\u00a0\nI step closer to the wall, jumping the switch between horizontal and vertical. \u201cI guess I already demonstrated this, but I don\u2019t want to use my super-strength on Mr. Stark\u2019s stuff.\u201d\n\u00a0\nI walk up the plaster, hoping I\u2019m not leaving footprints on the paint. In a moment I\u2019m standing upside down on the ceiling.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool, kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally!?\u201d I say incredulously.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, that would have helped us out back in the day.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat were the forties like, Mr. Barnes?\u201d I ask\u00a0eagerly.\n\u00a0\nHe smiles\u00a0mistily, nostalgia thick in his voice when he speaks, \u201cgrowing up was some of the best times of my life. I mean, there were bad things too. The Great Depression hit everyone hard, and I saw people starve, but we leant on each other.\u00a0Don\u2019t even get me started on block fights, but swing music and stuff was\u00a0really\u00a0popular, so me and Steve would go dancing all the time.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wish I could have lived back then, it would have been so cool!\u201d I say\u00a0excitedly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe lived in a queer neighbourhood, and the parties would be\u00a0absolutely\u00a0awesome. I mean, the stuff we got up to,\u201d he whistles, \"I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to tell you.\"\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you gay?\u201d I know it\u2019s probably insensitive, that even if he is it\u2019s none of my business and if he even wanted to tell me, it would be in his own time.\n\u00a0\nBucky swallows, \u201cUh, yeah, yeah I am.\u201d he says, eyes meeting mine\u00a0tersely.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCool. So what\u2019re block fights?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky laughs.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy is there footprints on the wall?\u201d Steve walks into the kitchen. I choke on my cornflakes, coughing\u00a0suspiciously. Bucky pats me on the back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are you two acting suspicious?\u201d Steve says, eyes narrowed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBucky\u2019s gay,\u201d I blurt out, \u201cSorry!\u201d\u00a0I say to Buck, \u201cI was\u00a0just\u00a0thinking about all the stuff you must\u2019ve gone though and what a change that had to have been coming from a homophobic community to an accepting one and\u00a0just\u2026\u201d I falter, giving Bucky a \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 look.\n\u00a0\nSteve raises an eyebrow, \u201cI know Bucky\u2019s gay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that big of a deal,\u201d Bucky says, \u201cI mean, we did live in a gay community, so we weren\u2019t\u00a0 that \u00a0exposed to homophobia. But we did know people who lived outside and\u00a0were hated\u00a0on.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSusanna, Joe Gringsworth, Violet Sherbasky,\u201d Steve lists, sipping a mug full of coffee.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJohnny White,\u201d Bucky adds, raising his eyebrows.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve sighs, looking sad, \u201cpoor Johnny.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened to Johnny?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSome guys beat him to death with a brick when they found out he was gay.\u201d Steve says\u00a0bluntly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I gape, \u201chow is that allowed?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe police didn\u2019t care,\u201d Bucky explains, \u201cjust\u00a0another queer.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow the fuck did that go by??\u201d I demand.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLanguage,\u201d Steve warns, \u201cand it didn\u2019t. Half the community was out for blood. They found one of the pricks that did it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d I ask, eyes wide as saucers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTied him up and threw him in the river,\" Bucky explains, picking at his metal arm.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike the Hudson?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shrugs, \u201cI don\u2019t remember now.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you do it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve hesitates, \u201cI helped.\u201d he says\u00a0stiffly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGot the ropes and stood watch while they threw the bastard in. Johnny was my friend.\u201d he explains, fire boiling in his eyes.\n\u00a0\nBucky clears his throat, \u201cI think\u00a0that\u2019s enough. We don\u2019t want to mentally scar him, and you remember Tony\u2019s rules.\"\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. Sorry kid.\u201d Steve apologises, the fire in his eyes simmering down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo! It\u2019s so cool! I\u2019m gonna do my report on it!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOn Captain America throwing homophobes in the river? Because I don\u2019t think Pepper, or PR, would be very happy with that,\u201d Bucky smirks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, on homophobia, focusing on the thirties and forties.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky laughs, sharing a look with Steve, \u201cYou go, kid.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cUh, hi?\u201d I say. There's someone in Mr. Stark\u2019s workshop that's not him and we \n\n\n\nwere meant\n\n\n\n to hang out today.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe turns \n\n\n\nabruptly\n\n\n\n, and I \n\n\n\nnearly\n\n\n\n faint when I see who it is.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nPrincess Shuri of Wakanda.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nPRINCESS SHURI OF FREAKING WAKANDA. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d she asks to my gaping jaw, thick African accent coloring her words. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cUh, hi,\u201d I rush inside, letting the door swing shut behind me. \n\n\n\nI offer my hand, and then bow \n\n\n\n\nawkwardly\n\n\n\n\n, dying inside (I don\u2019t think she notices), she covers her mouth with her hand, smirking\n\n\n\n. \u201cMs. princess, your majesty, Shuri,\u201d I greet, not knowing what to say. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe accepts my hand \n\n\n\ntentatively\n\n\n\n, \n\n\n\nprobably\n\n\n\n weirded out to death. \u201cHey, I\u2019m Shuri.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I stutter, \u201cOh! I\u2019m Peter.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHello, Peter,\u201d she laughs. \u201cSo do you work for Stark?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cUh, yeah, I guess I\u2019m an intern.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nHer eyebrows lift, \u201c\u2018I guess\u2019? Do you not have a job?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, the intern thing is \n\n\n\njust\n\n\n\n a cover. I\u2019m ah,\u201d I figure it\u2019s cool to tell her. \u201cWell, I\u2019m spider-man,\u201d I confess.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nHer eyes go wide, \u201c\n\n\nSPIDERMAN?!\u201d \n\n\nshe shrieks, \u201cI \n\n\n\nnearly\n\n\n\n broke a window when you stole Captain\u2019s shield!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThat was on TV?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course not. I hacked into the airport cameras.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYou would like my friend Ned,\u201d I recommend. \u201cYou into science?\u201d I ask, looking round at what she's constructing on one of Mr. Stark\u2019s spare workbenches. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she confirms, picking up an empty container that she doesn't need anymore. She throws it across the lab, yelling, \u201cthis bitch empty, yeet!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI choke on my own spit. YES. FINALLY A GEN Z-ER. I\u2019M GETTING SICK OF WANDA\u2019S MILLENNIAL TASTES.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAn hour later the lab is in utter disarray, Shuri and I are fightin\n\n\n\n\ng with REAL LIGHTSABERS, and I\u2019m pretty sure we pressed a few buttons we shouldn't have, because I got a news alert that said some of the old Iron-Man's suits at the Smithsonian exploded out of nowhere\n\n\n\n. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhoops?\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d the voice comes from the door of the lab. Tony and KING T\u2019CHALLA are standing at the doorway, slack-jawed.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d \n\n\n\nI drop the lightsaber with a clank and a sizzle that does not sound like something melting, definitely not\n\n\n\n. \u201cI met Shuri!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI see that,\u201d he says, eyes roaming around his precious lab. \u201cI forgot Peter was coming today,\u201d he adds to T\u2019Challa. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat have we done?\u201d the king whispers \n\n\n\ngravely\n\n\n\n. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHey Peter,\u201d Shuri says, I turn away from Tony and T\u2019Challa, who are still talking like it's the end of the world. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nDum-E\u2019s wearing shoes -- sandals to be exact. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are thooosee!\u201d Shuri and I belt out the same time. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\n\n it is the end of the world. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d I call out, wandering into the communal living room. It\u2019s empty, no-one to \n\n\n\nbe seen\n\n\n\n. \u201cFRIDAY? Where\u2019s Mr. Stark?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cIn his lab, but he\u2019s coming up now. You can wait for him here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks, FRI.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cNo problem, Peter.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI wander further into the room, flopping down on a couch. \n\n\n\nI pull out my science homework, figuring I\u2019ll \n\n\n\n\njust\n\n\n\n\n do my homework up here, but something shiny catches my attention\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThor\u2019s hammer. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s \n\n\n\njust\n\n\n\n sitting there, a block of some type of metal-stone material with a sturdy leather handle. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s \n\n\n\nstrangely\n\n\n\n beautiful, and I can\u2019t stop looking at it. I reach forward, fingers grazing the stone. As soon as my fingertips make contact, a strange jolt of electricity runs through me. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI grasp the handle, pulling it across the table and towards me \n\n\n\neasily\n\n\n\n. It\u2019s easy to lift, effortless, yet there's a strange grounding presence in my hand. Crackles of electricity flow through me every few seconds. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHey kid! Guess who\u2019s visiting from Asgard\u2026\u201d Tony stops, open mouthed in the doorway, a blonde Thor next to him. \n\n\nThor. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nOMG. OMG. THOR, \n\n\nTHOR.\n\n\n I\u2019M GOING TO DIE. \n\n\n\nLITERALLY\n\n\n\n, THIS IS THE END GUYS. WE MET THOR AND NOW MY LIFE IS COMPLETE. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m snapped out of my fanboy/panic induced trance at (for once) Tony\u2019s slack expression, and Thor's proud \u2014 and a little confused one\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nBoth of their gaze are set on the hammer still gripped in my hand. I \n\n\n\nnearly\n\n\n\n turn myself inside out in my apologies. \n\n\n\nWhat if picking up someone else's hammer is like \n\n\n\n\ntotally\n\n\n\n\n rude in Asgardian society and now Mr. Thor\u2019s gonna have to kill me\n\n\n\n! \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOmg, I\u2019m sorry Mr. Thor! It was just on the table and I\u2026\u201d I stumble forward, past my forgotten homework. Too late I remember I\u2019m still holding the hammer, and set it on the coffee table quickly. \u201cHonestly, I am so sorry, like that's probably really rude, but I just didn't think and it was right there and\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI trail off as the god approaches, lifting a hand and clapping it down on my shoulder, \u201cit is of little consequence.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, uh, it isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThor throws back his head and laughs, \u201cof course not. You should be proud, mortal, \n\n\n\nnot many\n\n\n\n have the worthy to wield such a weapon, you know now you have the power to rule\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd that's enough, Pointbreak,\u201d Tony interjects \n\n\n\nquickly\n\n\n\n, cutting the god off. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the kid getting a big head,\" he adds to Thor, \n\n\n\nquietly\n\n\n\n enough but I still hear it \n\n\n\nclearly\n\n\n\n. Super-senses and all. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d I ask, tilting my head.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nTony\u2019s gaze drifts to Mjolnir on the coffee table. \u201cNothing, kid,\u201d he says finally, shushing Thor when he goes to say something. \u201cHey, how about you go start working in the lab. I\u2019ll give you a hand with your homework.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a hand, Mr. Stark. Genius, remember?\" \n\n\n\nI say, a gathering my things, but still not convinced that everything's normal, especially when I see the hammer glinting on the low table\n\n\n\n. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Yeah kid, I remember,\" Tony says, trying to smile, although it \n\n\n\njust\n\n\n\n comes off constipated -- strange for him. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI walk past the two superheros standing in the doorway. Tony\u2019s glare to Thor silences him before he even opens his mouth. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThey wait to talk until I\u2019m down the hallway, but even then I can still hear. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYou do know that now he is a worthy ruler of Asgard \u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cShush! The kid has super hearing!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYour son seems to be quite powerful.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cSON?! No, I um, \n\n\n\njust\n\n\n\n, no I mean not to say \u2014 he\u2019s not my kid.\u201d Tony splutters, finally settling on a right answer.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, I see. My brother \n\n\n\nis adopted\n\n\n\n too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nTony\u2019s protests slip out of my range of hearing. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI crack a smile, laughing to myself as I reach the workshop.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Anything funny, Peter?\" FRIDAY asks from the ceiling. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"No, FRI, nothing at all,\" I grin. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean Loki\u2019s coming too?\u201d Mr. Stark demands. I can hear him greying from my place on the couch.\u00a0\n\u201cI told you already, I wish for him to see earth's beauty as I have.  Perhaps  he will be...less murderous,\u201d Thor says  eloquently .\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, buddy, I doubt that will stop him.\u201d\n\u201cI have been quite entranced!\u201d He booms, \"perhaps he will be entranced equally.\"\n\u00a0\u201cYou and Loki are quite different, if you haven't noticed.\u201d Mr. Stark sighs.\n\u00a0\u201cWe  were raised  the same, Man Of Iron!\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cI doubt you were,\u201d he mutters, swearing under his breath. After a moment of deliberation, he decides, \u201cFine. Loki can come.  But \u2014\u201d Stark says to Mr. Thor\u2019s enthusiastic face, \u201c\u2014 if he even thinks about world domination, I will send him right back to Asgard.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cUnderstood, brother,\u201d Thor says  solemnly, going to leave now that his mission is accomplished.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u201cMy god,\u201d Stark curses under his breath, muttering something in Italian that I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t want to hear. Delicate ears.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThree days later Loki and Thor arrive. Mr. Stark told me not to talk to the \u2018manic\u2019. Pfft, he looks nice and  slightly  misunderstood to me. Thor charges off to meet with Dr. Jane, leaving Loki, Mr. Stark and I alone in the compound.  Mr. Stark has to take a business call, because \u2014 I quote \u2014 \u201cPepper will have my balls if I don't\u201d I know he's serious because he doesn't laugh at my: \u201cI thought Pepper already had your balls  ?\u201d  Honestly, that's pretty funny.\u00a0\nI\u2019m thirsty, so I scrawl a note on a post-it, and suanter out of the lab to get a drink from the kitchen.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cAnd who are you, pray tell?\u201d Loki asks, stepping forward. I choke on my water, coughing  heavily.\nI swallow. \u201cUh, hi, my name's Peter and aren't you mean to be evil?\u201d\nLoki shrugs, \u201cI can hardly keep up anymore.\u201d\n\u201cOh, cool, cool,\u201d I say, nodding along and trying to be casual.\nHe cocks a brow, smile growing, \u201cyou are son of Stark, correct?\u201d\n\u201cWhat..no, no, no! I\u2019m not his..uh, I\u2019m not Mr. Starks kid! Not that that wouldn't be awesome and everything, but yeah, I\u2019m not uh...his,\u201d I cringe.\u00a0\nYOU MEET A LITERAL GOD AND THIS IS WHAT YOU DO. WHAT THE HELL, PARKER.\n\u201cHuh, I see. Romanoff son?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d I say  frantically\n\u201cBruceson?\u201d\n\u201cBruce is cool, but he's not my dad.\u201d\n\u201cSteveson?\u201d\n\u201cUh, I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s possible.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBuckyson?\u201d\n\u201cAgain, don\u2019t know if that's possible.\u201d\n\u201cPepperson?\u201d\n\u201cMs. Potts is awesome and MJ says she's an iconic woman, but, uh, no.\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Loki stops to think for a moment, then gasps, \u201clokison?!\u201d\n\u201cNo, no! My parents died when I was little,\u201d I clarify.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Loki reaches out to rest a surprisingly cold hand on my shoulder, \u201cI see. My parents are dead too, both biological and not.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018biological and not\u2019?\u201d I question, confused.\u00a0\nHe barks out a laugh, \u201cyou do not know?\u201d at the shake of my head he continues, \u201cI am a frost giant, adopted by Odin and raised alongside Thor.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nA pregnant moment passes between us while I try and control my wild grin, \u201cElsa,\u201d I whisper, not able to wrangle myself.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nTime jump 5 hours.\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter, why are there penguins lose in Central Park?\u201d the pirate asks, at least that\u2019s what he looks like. I know, logically, that this man is the commander of one of the most feared organizations in the world, and he is just as deadly as the spies he commands...but come on! An eyepatch?! That's asking for shiver-me-timbers jokes!\n\u00a0\u201cUh, because there aren't any polar bears?\u201d\n\u00a0Fury sighs, steepling his hand on his tempel \u201cmy god,\u201d he whispers.\n\u00a0Tony barges through the door. I shiver, the kool aid juice I'm doused in is not helping -- especially with aircon.\u00a0\n\u201cThat thing with the models,\u201d he blows a kiss towards me, \u201cfantastic.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt was Mr. Loki\u2019s idea, Mr. Stark.\u201d I blush, \u201cbut the slime was mine.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRhodey and me at MIT couldn't have done better.\u201d\n\u201cRhodey and I, Mr. Stark,\" I correct. He's a genius, shouldn't he know basic grammar?\u00a0\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d he waves a hand at me. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\n\u201cAre we allowed?\u201d I ask, sparing a glance at Fury \u2014 looking as done with life as a middle-aged janitor at a high school.  Honestly, mood.\n\u00a0\u201cOf course we are!\u201d Tony jets out before Nick can respond, \u201cc\u2019mon Peter.\u201d He opens the door and I get up and make my way out, squelching  slightly.\n\u00a0\u201cWait, where\u2019s Mr. Loki?\u201d\n\u201cDetained with Thor. We\u2019ll break him out later.\u201d Tony closes the door, cutting off Fury mid-rant: \u201cI swear to god Stark, if you break out a megalomaniac I will\u2014!\u201d\n\u201cI thought you didn't like Mr. Loki?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t, I like his pranks,\u201d the billionaire -- and apparently prankster -- says, turning down a corridor.\n\u201cNext you\u2019ll be tell me that you don\u2019t like Star Trek.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWelllll,\u201d Mr. Stark screws up his face, whistling  slightly.\n\u00a0\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d I breath, scandalized and offended to my very core.\n\u201cHurry up, kid,\u201d he says, powering forward. I run to catch up, picking egg out of my hair.\n\u00a0\n\nPeter comes home on Friday, pushing open the door with one hand and slinging his backpack to skid across the shiny tiles towards the couch\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWithout looking at the kitchen, he turns towards the fridge, rifling though it's contents\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAgh!\u201d he shrieks, falling backwards. \nA dark-skinned warrior with braided hair and white marks decorating her face is bending over him, shiny blade pointed at his throat\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI will say again, who are you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter, Peter Parker,\u201d I stammer, eyes fixated on her knife.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the spider-boy?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSpider-\n\nMan!\u201d\n\n I protest, she cocks and eyebrow and I mutter, \u201cbut it doesn't matter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHuh. Thor told me about you.\u201d She straightens, flicking the blade into a hidden pocket somewhere.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, uh, he did?\u201d I say \nhesitantly\n, getting to my feet. The girl doesn't apologize, \njust\n saunters over to the counter.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes. He says you are quite adorable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m not,\u201d I say \nweakly\n, flexing my back under my shirt.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d she says, tipping her head back and sculling the bottle left sitting on the table.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWow, you drink...fast,\u201d I say, watching in awe.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe finishes the bottle, raising an eyebrow, \u201cand?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNothing, I\u2019m \njust\n impressed.\u201d \nI say \nquickly\n, covering up the awkwardness with blabber, \u201cNot even Mr. Stark can drink that fast, and I\u2019ve seen him down a full bottle of champagne to get away from talking to a journalist\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d she says, slamming her bottle down. \u201cWant some?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat if it\u2019s \nreally\n disrespectful not to take what's given to you?! Omigod I have to take it. Only a sip would be okay...right? \u201cUh, yeah, sure.\u201d I say.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo! The spider-\n\nBABY\n\n would not like any.\u201d Quick as a whip, Tony darts in, grabbing the offending bottle and dashing away.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou are underage!\u201d he says from the lounge. \u201cIt\u2019s illegal, Underoos! Illegal!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s Asgardian, Tony,\n\n Asgardian.\n\n I'm being cordial!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat doesn't matter! You are not getting drunk until you are at least 30!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat about you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d he says, cocking his head, daring me to continue.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI roll my eyes, \u201cMr. Stark, everyone remembers Halloween 2006.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe goes to say something, but his mouth open and closes like a goldfish, \u201cokay, but\u2014 that is \ntotally\n different.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs it?\u201d I taunt.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, because I was over-age and a functioning adult.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI raise my eyebrows, \u201cMr. Stark, you're not a functioning adult \n\nnow.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, but you\u2019re not drinking on my watch.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter blinks, eyes flicking everywhere, \u201cUh, yeah, I\u2019ve never gotten drunk before,\u201d he says nervously.... no he \n\nLIES \n\nnervously\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony narrows his eyes, \u201cPeter\u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter cuts him off before he can even start to grill him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay, it was one time and Flash invited us to this party and people were drinking... so \n\nFOR SCIENCE\n\n Ned and I decided to test if I can get drunk. I can,\" I bursts out, wringing my fingers together.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKid,\u201d Tony sighs, resting his hand in his forehead.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI can get hangovers too.\u201d I tell him \nsolemnly\n. \u201cAlthough mine aren't that bad. \nI think\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony is leaning on the counter, swearing and moaning: \"what am I gonna tell his aunt? Do I tell his aunt? Whyyy Peter.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe knife-girl is leaning on the counter, toying with the empty bottle in her hands. \u201coh, I like you,\u201d she murmurs, voice a strange twist of Asgard and Sakaar.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"My name's Valkyrie, by the way.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Hi,\" I say, leaning over Tony to shake her hand. She eyes my outstretched fingers for a moment, and then shakes my hand \nlightly\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUh, hi Ms. Potts,\u201d I say \nawkwardly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe stops short. \u201cHi? Uh, I don\u2019t know how you got up here, but you better get back down to R&amp;D fast. \nTony doesn't like anyone in his personal labs,\u201d she warns, setting down her armful of paperwork in preparation to rush me to the door\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUm, I\u2019m uh, allowed up here,\u201d I stammer, still unbelieving that I'm meeting \n\nPepper Potts, the Pepper Potts. \n\n\u201cMJ says that you're an iconic women in business, by the way,\u201d I blurt out.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe turns to me, confusion clear in her gaze, \u201cthanks?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, Underoos! Where are you?\u201d Mr. Stark\u2019s voice echoes from the other room \njust\n in time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI bound though with a glance to Pepper, who follows me \nslowly\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony\u2019s fiddling with the TV, twisting some wires together \nintently\n. In typical Tony Stark fashion, he doesn't even notice our entry.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPepper sighs, \u201cTony.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe crawls out from under the TV, \u201cHi Pep!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat have I told you about adopting interns?\" \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, he's not exactly an intern, per say,\u201d Tony hums, blinking his lashes \ninnocently\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPepper narrows her eyes, \u201cwhat is he, then?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUh...Spider-Man?\u201d Tony squeaks, ready to run.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPepper \njust\n freezes, battling \ninternally\n, \u201cTony, are you telling me you took a \n\nteenager\n\n to \n\nGermany\n\n to fight \n\nCaptain America\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was already Spider-Man, Ms. Potts,\u201d I rush in. \u201cIt's not Mr. Stark's fault, he actually helped. I would have killed myself running around without a proper suit.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Tony cuts in harshly. I flinch, and his face softens. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s just...I put you in danger, kid, you never should have been in Germany, much less fighting Cap.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMr. Stark \u2014\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKid,\u201d Tony cuts in, \u201cdon\u2019t even try.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTony,\u201d Pepper says, arching her eyebrows in a look that totally means something. Tony clears his throat. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRight. Kid, you can go grab your web-shooters from the shop if you wanna work on them down here.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay, Mr. Stark,\u201d I say \nhesitantly\n and \nsuspiciously\n, standing up and walking to the door. Mr. Stark gives me a \n\n\u2018shoo' \n\ngesture, I roll my eyes and walk down to the lift.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat's with the Mr./Ms. thing?\u201d I hear Ms. Potts ask Tony.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI can hear Tony shrug, \u201cdunno. I don\u2019t mind it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Pepper says, and that's all I hear, their conversation falling out of my range of hearing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen I come back up the living room is empty and Tony is back to fiddling with the TV.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe looks up, \u201csome minor persuasion on my part, but it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s cool with it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWith what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI give him a look, tilting my head, \u201cSpider-Man, dude!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh right, right, right. Yep, no she\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre yous sure?\u201d I prod.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes \n\nMom,\u201d\n\n he stresses. I wrinkle my nose the same time as he bursts into laughter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next time I visit the tower there\u2019s a plate of cookies sitting on the couch, covered in glad-wrap with no less than three sticky notes\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTONY. NO. DO NOT EAT. I DON'T CARE (FOR ONCE) HOW LONG YOU\u2019VE BEEN IN THE WORKSHOP. GO TO THE FRIDGE.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCLINT, YOU TOO. I WILL TELL LAURA.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPeter, these are for you. They are good bargaining chips with the rest of the team, so use \n\n\nwisely\n\n\n ;) -Pepper.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nI full-out laugh, unpeeling the glad-wrap \ncarefully\n to use later, it\u2019ll make a good trap. I doubt world-class assassins \nare trained\n in the art of glad-wrap (it is an art.) I take a cookie, sinking my teeth into the chewy-soft sweet dough. They\u2019re perfect. If I could, I would marry this cookie \u2014 hell, I\u2019ll marry it anyway.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Natasha says in way of introduction. \nI jump \nslightly\n, but it\u2019s better than that time I dropped four eggs \u2018cos she walked into my bedroom without me noticing\n. Don\u2019t ask why I had eggs in my bedroom. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHi, Nat.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat you doing?\u201d she leans over my shoulder, \u201ccookies?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBeaming, I say, \u201cI met Pepper, finally.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you before?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always been busy or away,\" I explain.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Natasha fingers go to pluck a cookie, but I swat her hand away.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUh-uh, my cookies.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid Pepper tell you to use them as bribes?\u201d Natasha laughs.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBargaining chips, actually.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSounds like her\u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey! I want cookies!\u201d Clint interrupts, sauntering through the door.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cToo bad!\u201d I yell back, re-wrapping the plate and dashing out the door to my room.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d Clint yells, chasing after me.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNever!\u201d I grin \nmanically\n, sprinting down the hallways.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen I come home as per usual on Friday, I find a scary-looking pirate waiting. He looks pissed off and irritated, so I'm guessing he's \njust\n talked to Mr. Stark\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nUh, no, I\u2019m not getting into this. I put down my bag, intending to retreat. Of course he sees me.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe arches an eyebrow, one good eye staring at me. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUh.. Peter, who are you?\u201d I ask in return.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDirector Fury,\u201d he greets, not extending a hand. Neither do I.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRight. Well,\u201d I turn towards the door \nawkwardly\n. I can still escape. I\u2019m sick of meeting superheros in the kitchen, (\n\nwhy is it always the kitchen?!)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis voice stops me, \u201cwho are you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI turn back around, \u201cI told you, Peter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe chuckles a laugh. I have a feeling it's not because what I said was funny. \u201cNo, who are you to Stark and the others?.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell I dunno...I\u2019m Mr. Stark's intern \u2014\u201d I lie \nfrantically\n,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\u2014 yeah, yeah Spider-Man. I mean \npersonally\n, to the team.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWait how do you know I\u2019m \u2014\u201d I lower my voice to a conspiratorial whisper, \u201cSpider-Man?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKid, we have \nmultiple\n pictures of you climbing into your window, and that's not even the start. \nHonestly\n, I\u2019m surprised you haven't \nbeen attacked by\n super-villains several times, anyone who cares could have found out \neasily\n. Now, back to the main point,\u201d he says, cutting off any replies. \u201cWho are you to the Avengers?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI dunno, I mean, \nI think\n everybody likes me,\u201d I shuffle \nawkwardly\n. \u201cI\u2019m learning Russian from Ms. Romanoff and Bucky and Steve helped me on a paper for school. I got an A+.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGod, it\u2019s worse than I thought,\u201d he mumbles, rubbing a hand over his eyes...well, eye.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat is?\u201d I let out a little shriek, jumping, Fury does the event of the same, looking up \nhastily\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNatasha is standing behind me, smiling sugar sweet, something sharp and devilish behind her smile, coated in red lipstick.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNow, \u043f\u0430\u0443\u043a, we have to go. Stark\u2019s planning a prank war,\u201d she puts her hands on my shoulders, fingers curling along my collar bone. I know her eyes have not strayed from Fury, and I know any other man would \nbe scared\n shitless right now.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFury is not any other man.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAgent \u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\u2014 I\u2019m not sure what crimes or connections this \n\nminor\n\n has to any criminal organization, and I very \nhighly\n doubt you are here to recruit him, so, I would recommend leaving before \n\nStark\n\n comes down you see you preying on a \n\nclose confidant\n\n and \n\nchild\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFury stares after us \nstonily\n, Natasha marching me out of the kitchen. I whisper a \u2018thanks\u2019 and she only shakes her head, \u201cyou do not have to thank me, \u043f\u0430\u0443\u043a.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter bumped into someone while entering the living room, \u201coh, sorry,\u201d h mumbled, not looking up from his homework\n. He has three tests in the next week. \n\nThree\n\n. Even if he's a 'genius' like Mr. Stark keeps telling him, he needs to learn these Spanish vowels.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d comes a \nvaguely\n Russian-sounding voice. Peter\u2019s head snaps up, realising it's not an Avenger.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, you're that magic girl,\u201d Wanda blinks at him, Vision hovering a few feet behind.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWanda. But yes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter nods, eyes turning to Vision. \u201cWoah, you're like a robot,\u201d he says, staring up at him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d he says, his impersonal, British voice amused. \u201cAlthough Mr. Stark likes to call me an AI stealer. If not sure how \nI feel\n about the moniker.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter laughs, \u201cyeah, he calls me weird things too. \nI think\n he does with everyone.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, I have found that,\u201d Vision agrees, his cloak rippling around him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe calls you the\u2026.spider, does he not?\u201d Wanda asks, \u201cyou are Peter, correct?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, Peter Parker, nice to meet you,\u201d he sticks out a hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe takes it with a jovial smile, \u201cI\u2019m Wanda Maximoff.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have business to attend to,\u201d Vision says, \u201cit was nice meeting you, Peter,\u201d he nods \ncordially\n and floats through the wall\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c....That's creepy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe raises an eyebrow, \u201cyeah. You get used to it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCool. Can you yeet me across the room?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWanda shrugs, \u201csure.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe's raising her hands in preparation, red light gathering between her fingers, when Mr. Stark walks into the room\n. He sees Peter\u2019s grinning face and Wanda\u2019s outstretched hands and yells \u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs quick as a blink, the smile \nis wiped\n off Peter\u2019s face and if not for the press coverage, you would have no idea Wanda can control magic\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe weren't doing anything,\u201d Peter says \ninnocently\n, clasping his hands behind his back. Wanda copies, pulling out doe-eyes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know you, Peter! I swear\n\n to god,\n\n if you asked someone to \u2018yeet you\u2019, \n\nagain\n\n, I\u2019m disowning you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c...but, Mr. Stark, we\u2019re not related.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was a figure of speech, and you didn't disagree!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh ha, but I didn't agree, either,\u201d Peter cackles, high-fiving Wanda, who goes along with it, although looks \nslightly\n confused\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony \njust\n stares, you can see his hair greying and his face seems to get more confused/concerned/exasperated by every passing second\n. \u201cPeter,\u201d he finally says, \nslowly\n, \ncalmly\n, \u201cif you don't stop, I\u2019m gonna yeet you \n\noff the helipad\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter starts to smile \nmadly\n, an idea glimmering in his eyes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter. NO.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All right, all right, sit down, the lot of you!\" Steve yelled over the hubbub, carrying two steaming plate of food. Bruce came in behind, also carrying plates. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019re having a big team dinner, all crowded onto the newly-extended dining room table, all the Avengers are here, Pepper, Happy, Ant Man, Hope, Cassie, Brunnhilde, Korg, Dr. Strange, Carol, Wanda, Shuri, T\u2019Challa, all the Guardians of the Galaxy, Bucky, Rhodey and Nebula.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is really good Mr. Steve,\u201d Peter said earnestly, after his first big bite. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks, Peter,\u201d Steve smiled.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTook a couple hours in the kitchen, but it\u2019s well worth it,\u201d Bruce added on.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d Tony murmured from Peter\u2019s left. \u201cIt\u2019s great, Cap.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn Asgard, we roast boars over a spit for several hours,\u201d Brunnhilde offers. \u201cThis is not too dissimilar, I find.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn Louisiana,\u201d Carol says, \u201cwe...\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter fazes out of the conversation easily, pushing peas around his plate. He looks up and thinks \n\nfamily. \n\nMr. Stark is flicking peas at Clint \u2014 who is throwing them right back \u2014 Natasha is filling Brunnhilde\u2019s glass with vodka, Dr. Strange is spinning magical yellow symbols into the air, and Thor, Korg and Shuri are all in a contest of some sort, run by Pepper, Rhodey looks like he just wants to eat his steak and get rid of Rocket, who is no doubt trying to get him to sell the armour, the rest of the Guardians are arguing, Carol is talking to Bucky about...fight critiques? And Scott and Hope are not-so-subtly making eyes at each other, something that Cassie is miming throwing up about.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat about you, squirt?\u201d Natasha asks him. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 my Aunt can't cook,\u201d he says. The table roars into laughter, Tony gagging at the memory. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYeah, \n\nPeter thinks again, \n\nthis is family. \n\n\n\n\n"
