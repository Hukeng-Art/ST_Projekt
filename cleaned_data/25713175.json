    "text": "\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bakugou Katsuki always knew that he had what it took to be a hero. He had a strong quirk, bravery, the drive to win, and even a sidekick already lined up for him. It was perfect!\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that was before.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0After, Katsuki became someone entirely different. He was no longer the determined leader with big dreams, but instead a cruel and vindictive child that asserted his dominance over others through blunt force. He stopped speaking to his best friend, Midoriya Izuku, and instead pushed others to isolate the boy. He held such a grudge against him for what happened, even though logically, Katsuki knew that it wasn\u2019t his fault. Of course it wasn\u2019t Izuku\u2019s fault.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seventeen year-old Katsuki was ashamed of his past behavior. He couldn\u2019t change the past, no matter how much he wished he could. He supposed it didn\u2019t matter anymore; he and Deku were friends now, they had both gotten into U.A., and were on the fast track to graduating at the top of their class. What had happened to them all those years ago was nothing more than a bad memory.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or at least, it \n\nhad \n\nbeen, before Aizawa-sensei ruined it all.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cListen, I don\u2019t want to give this class anymore than the rest of you want to be here,\u201d the tired hobo of a man said as he clicked on the projector at the front of the room. Class 2-A shifted awkwardly in their seats, already knowing what was coming. \u201cLet\u2019s just get this over with so that we never have to talk about it again, alright?\u201d The text on the projector screen popped up, revealing the subject matter for the next hour. \nSex Ed.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Katsuki crossed his arms, his heart pounding. He\u2019d heard that, due to the dorms being established in their first year, the sex ed class this year would be different than it had been all the previous years. He had a bad feeling about what that might mean, and his theory wasn\u2019t proven any better when a knock sounded on the classroom door. Without waiting, the door slid open, revealing the pro-hero Midnight and another extra that Katsuki didn\u2019t recognize.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHellooooooo everyone~\u201d Midnight said cheerily, stepping into the room with the meek looking man in tow behind her. \u201cWho\u2019s ready for sex ed?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ashido Mina, being the unashamed bitch she was, smirked and leaned back in her seat with her arms crossed. \u201cOh, this will be fun.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m gonna die,\u201d Kaminari wheezed from his own seat.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Aizawa said, halting the conversation. \u201cClass, I\u2019m sure you know why Midnight is here. The man behind her is named Kajiyama Yumi. This is his first year with us, so please for the love of \n\ngod\n\n, treat him with some respect.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy\u2019s he here?\u201d Jirou whispered to Katsuki, scowling at the newcomer. Clearly she was as suspicious of him as Katsuki was, proving to him that she really was the smartest extra in his dumbass friend group. Well, besides him, of course.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cH-hello everyone,\u201d Kajiyama stuttered, giving them all a quick bow. \u201cPrincipal Nedzu asked me to come here to help with the sex ed portion of your curriculum to make sure that you all answer any questions Aizawa-sensei or Midnight-sensei may have for you. My quirk is called Truth Gas, and does basically as it sounds. My body will secret a gas that, when inhaled, will have all of you telling the truth for exactly one hour. If there is anyone here who would rather not be subjected to this quirk then please, say so now so that you may be escorted to Recovery Girl\u2019s office.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cJust know that it will look incriminating,\u201d Midnight said cheerily. Katsuki could feel the dread in the pit of his stomach grow even more. He could almost taste the anxiety rolling off of shitty Deku in waves from the seat behind him. The dweeb was probably only seconds away from muttering uncontrollably, and for once, Katsuki couldn\u2019t blame him. After all, they had the same reason for being nervous.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo takers?\u201d Midnight asked. \u201cAlrighty then! Kajiyama-san, please go ahead and administer the gas. To make it fair, Aizawa-kun and I will also be inhaling the gas. Please do not abuse this power on either us or each other, as doing so will result in serious consequences.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAw man,\u201d Kaminari whined. Sero and Mina slumped as well, looking just as disappointed. Those fucking troublemakers no doubt wanted to ask everyone some nosy-ass questions to get some secrets, or some dumb shit like that.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kajiyama closed his eyes, holding his hands out in front of him. Slowly, a light blue gas began to seep into the room, floating around eye-level for everyone sitting at their desks. If Katsuki thought it would have helped, he might have held his breath to avoid breathing the stuff in, but he knew it would ultimately be useless. All he could do was pray that whatever questions Aizawa and Midnight were going to ask, they wouldn\u2019t be any of the questions that he would have a problem with answering.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But since Deku was involved, with that shithead\u2019s luck, everything would spill out into the open.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0The gas smelled vaguely sweet, kind of like cotton candy. Katsuki felt dizzy for a few seconds right after inhaling it, but other than that, nothing really felt different about him. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the guy\u2019s quirk had actually worked or not, or if it was all some sort of fluke. Kajiyama put his hands down and opened his eyes, bowing a bit to the class with a small smile. \u201cThat\u2019s all for me. The quirk will wear off exactly one hour from now, so I suggest you get your class started immediately. Thank you for having me.\u201d With that, the guy left the classroom.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aizawa eyed all of his students, shaking his head a little before he began. \u201cI\u2019m sure you all got a talk about puberty when you were in middle school, so we\u2019re going to go ahead and skip that part of the normal sex ed lesson. Principal Nedzu has compiled a list of questions for us to ask you, and Midnight has made a small lesson on what she thinks is important when it comes to practicing safe and consenual sex, so do us all a favor and just pay attention so we never have to do this again.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re talking about consent?\u201d Uraraka said, snorting to herself. \u201cNow I wish Mineta hadn\u2019t been expelled. He could\u2019ve learned something.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m right here,\u201d Shinsou, Mineta\u2019s replacement, said dryly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI know honey, and we love you,\u201d Hagakure said, making kissy noises at the guy two seats behind Katsuki. Bakugou bared his teeth at the invisible girl, receiving a blown raspberry in return. Sometimes he missed that days that his classmates were too afraid to cross him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSettle down,\u201d Midnight said. \u201cThis is my favorite class to teach, so don\u2019t ruin it for me!\u201d She pulled a bunch of notecards seemingly out of thin air, shuffling them around in her hand so that she could get started. \u201cAlright, today we will be talking about how to safely practice sex between the female and male sexes, two male sexes, and two female sexes. Believe it or not, it is important to use protection no matter what your sex or gender is, because STDs can be spread a lot easier than one might think.\u201d She turned to Aizawa, gesturing to him. He shook his head, muttering something about how he \u201creally didn\u2019t want to do this,\u201d before he picked up his own notecards.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAlright. We will start with each of you raising your hands. How many of you in this room have had sex before?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Katsuki clenched his jaw together, but just like he suspected, his hand moved on its own, raising high in the air. He looked around to see who else had been caught in the web, surprised to find that over half of the class had their hands raised as well. Huh. Maybe he really could get through this lesson in one piece.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAlright, so Aoyama, Ashido, Asui, Uraraka, Oijiro, Kaminari, Kirishima, Shoji, Jirou, Sero, Hagakure, Bakugou, Midoriya, and Shinsou,\u201d Aizawa listed. Apparently the only virgins in the room were Iida (big shocker), Kouda, Satou, Tokoyami, Todoroki, and Yaomomo.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Midnight herself even looked surprised. \u201cWow, I wasn\u2019t expecting such a big turnout. Kids these days.\u201d She laughed airily, like this wasn\u2019t the most uncomfortable situation any of them had ever been in. \u201cAlright, it\u2019s my turn to ask. Out of all of you, how many of you have had sex in the dorms?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Katsuki felt blessed to be able to put his hand down, and couldn\u2019t help but peek around to see who else had put their hands down. He was absolutely floored to find that the only other person to put their hand down was Deku. Every other extra had fucked in the dorms. Not for the first time, Katsuki was grateful for his early bedtime, if it meant that he didn\u2019t have to listen to some of these fuckers going at it with each other.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s disconcerting,\u201d Aizawa groaned, but still flipped to his next card. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s why Nedzu wanted us to ask, though.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt is highly disrespectful to the U.A. establishment for so many of you to have broken the rules so blatantly!\u201d Iida cried, making his violent chopping motions, as always. \u201cI must say that I\u2019m disappointed in you all!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s just mad because he\u2019s still a virgin,\u201d Jirou huffed, crossing her arms over her chest. Iida\u2019s face flushed bright red while the rest of the class laughed. Even Katsuki couldn\u2019t help the grin that spread across his face as he uncrossed his arms and left one underneath the desk. Jirou took the invitation and high-fived him, smirking at him out of the corner of her eye.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s enough from all of you,\u201d Aizawa snapped. \u201cIida, let me take care of the punishments, alright? The rest of you, stop bullying your classmate for following the rules.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNext question!\u201d Midnight chirped. \u201cHow many of you are comfortable with establishing your sexual identity?\u201d Every hand in class went up, so Midnight nodded. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we start at the front and go around then, so we can make sure that everyone is properly educated on what they need to be educated on.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Aoyama was the first to go, posing like a freak like he always did when he was the center of attention. Katsuki knew before the shithead even spoke what he was going to say. \u201cI like boys. Sorry to the \n\nfemmes\n\n in the room, \n\nmon amis.\n\n\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ashido cleared her throat, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m also gay as hell. Sorry to all the boys in the room.\u201d She fluttered her eyelashes at Aoyama, who pretended to look heartbroken. Asui touched her finger to her chin before she spoke.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI like boys and girls, but have a definite preference for women, \n\nkero.\n\n\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Iida began his hand-chopping again, his face suspiciously pink as he spoke. \u201cI would normally say that I am solely attracted to women, but there have been a few cases in which I have also found men attractive!\u201d Okay, was it Katsuki\u2019s imagination or did that fucker glance at Deku?\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI like boys and girls equally!\u201d Uraraka said, flashing a peace sign at them all.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m straight,\u201d Oijiro said meekly, twisting his tail in his hands.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a hardcore bisexual, my guy,\u201d Kaminari said, looking Aizawa dead in the eye with a pair of finger guns.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSame,\u201d Kirishima said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u2018\n\nI\u2019m asexual,\u2019\n\n Kouda signed, Shinsou taking the initiative to translate for the boy.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m straight, too,\u201d Satou said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cI like boys and girls,\u201d Shoji shrugged. \u201cThere isn\u2019t really a ratio or anything.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cI like women,\u201d Jirou declared. Katsuki knew he wasn\u2019t imagining the girl sneaking a glance at Yaomomo to see how the brunette reacted.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t really care,\u201d Sero admitted. \u201cI just have to vibe with them.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cI do not find myself attracted to either gender,\u201d Tokoyami said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cI suppose I like boys,\u201d Todoroki told them all, his face as impassive as ever.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOuch! Who\u2019s gonna tell his fan club?\u201d Kaminari joked. Todoroki didn\u2019t seem to get it, just like usual.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not a hero yet. It would be weird if I already had a fan club.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m straight, too!\u201d Hagakure said from in front of Katsuki, waving a hand in the air to get the attention back onto her.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0All eyes turned to Katsuki, and he couldn\u2019t stop himself from grumbling. \u201cAs if you fuckers don\u2019t already know I\u2019m gay as shit.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGee, I wonder what tipped us off. The eyeliner or the fashion sense,\u201d Sero muttered. Katsuki turned to him with sparking palms, snarling.\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cMy parents are fucking fashion designers, you walmart brand roll of scotch tape!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cU-um, I guess I classify myself as bisexual?\u201d Deku said from behind Katsuki. \u201cB-but I prefer men\u2026?\u201d Katsuki calmed back down, huffing as he recrossed his arms over his chest. It didn\u2019t exactly take a genius to see that Deku was attracted to men, even if he was a lot more obvious about being flustered by pretty girls.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI like men,\u201d Shinsou deadpanned.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI like women,\u201d Yaomomo said shyly, being the last one to go. Midnight clapped her hands, looking positively gleeful.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe have such a good ratio this year!\u201d She cheered. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re all comfortable with yourselves to speak about it!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re literally under a truth quirk, but go off I guess,\u201d Satou snickered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHey, she gave us an option!\u201d Uraraka defended.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe more you all stall, the less we get to cover in class, and the bigger the chance of taking another class gets,\u201d Aizawa drawled. Everyone shut up, turning their attention back to the front of the room. Katsuki couldn\u2019t decide if he wanted this shit over with, or if he wanted everyone to stall as much as they could so that he wouldn\u2019t have to face what he was afraid of facing. It normally wasn\u2019t like him at all to avoid his fears, but this subject matter was something different entirely. It was something that only two people in the entire world knew about, and one of them was \n\nDeku\n\n. He would rather not reveal it in front of the entire class, if he had the chance.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Deku was bouncing his knee under his desk, and when Katsuki turned around to check, he saw that the nerd was biting on his index finger so that he wouldn\u2019t mutter, too. Deku\u2019s emerald eyes landed on Katsuki\u2019s, and the two of them shared a knowing look. Ever since their fight at Ground Beta in their first year, Bakugou and Deku had been getting together rather well. Katsuki often joined Deku and All Might in their little \u201cOne for All\u201d training lessons, and he spent a lot of time helping Deku figure out his shitty quirk, as well. Before All Might had died at the beginning of their second year, the three of them had gotten rather close. His death only proved to force Katsuki and Deku even closer, since they now kept the secret of Deku\u2019s quirk all to themselves. As if they didn\u2019t already have a big enough secret shouldered between them.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOne last question from Nedzu before we move on,\u201d Midnight said. \u201cAizawa, do you want to do the honors?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d rather take a nap,\u201d the tired man said, but he still lifted his cards to read the question. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m supposed to ask each of you individually how old you were the first time you had sex, as well as the last time, so we can get an accurate indicator of your sexual activity and what you all may need to learn from this course.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And just like that, all of the blood drained for Katsuki\u2019s face. He whipped back around to stare at Deku, wide-eyed and panicked like he\u2019d never been before. The green haired boy looked just as horrified, his entire body stiff with terror at the question. It was the exact question that they had dreaded being asked, and of \n\ncourse\n\n they would have to answer it in front of everyone.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAoyama-kun, how old were you the first time you had sex?\u201d Aizawa asked, looking like he\u2019d rather be literally anywhere else. Aoyama was obviously enjoying making his teacher uncomfortable, because he propped his chin on his hand and fluttered his lashes at the man.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI was sixteen, \n\nmon cherie\n\n~\u201d the blond stated. Aizawa sighed and pinched his eyes closed, ignoring Midnight\u2019s cackling laughter before he reopened them.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow old were you the last time?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAlso sixteen,\u201d Aoyama answered. Aizawa nodded and marked it down, moving on.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cFifteen and seventeen,\u201d Ashido answered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSixteen for both,\u201d Asui croaked. Iida was skipped, still being a virgin, and Uraraka went next.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFifteen and seventeen,\u201d the girl blushed, glancing at her girlfriend, Ashido, before quickly looking away. She, Ashido and Kirishima had all been dating since the second month of their first year, and appeared to still be going strong.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cSeventeen for both,\u201d Oijiro admitted, not bothering to look at his invisible girlfriend. The rest of the extras went down the line, all of them being somewhere within the fifteen to seventeen range. The amount of people in between Katsuki and his fate decreased far too quickly for his liking, and he had to grip the edges of his desk with white knuckles just to stop himself from accidentally blowing up the classroom. His heart was pounding in his chest, his ears filling with the buzzing of panic. He hadn\u2019t felt this level of anxiety since his and Deku\u2019s fight at Ground Beta, where he\u2019d had a massive panic attack before he beat Deku into the ground.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Hagakure answered seventeen for both questions as well, blowing a kiss at her blushing boyfriend before all eyes turned to Katsuki. Aizawa-sensei opened his mouth to ask the dreaded questions, and without thinking, Katsuki cut him off.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t fucking ask me that,\u201d he snapped, digging his nails into the wood of his desk. Aizawa sighed, looking up at the ceiling like it would give him all the answers to life.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBakugou, don\u2019t be difficult, everyone had to answer,\u201d Aizawa grumbled.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI fucking mean it,\u201d Katsuki warned. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna fucking answer, and you don\u2019t wanna fucking hear it. Do you hear me? I\u2019ll blow your ass up so hard-\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cKinky,\u201d Kaminari whispered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cS-sensei,\u201d Deku stuttered, trying to advocate for Katsuki.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Really, Katsuki should have known to be more specific. Perhaps if he\u2019d told Aizawa that he would rather have this conversation in private, then the man would have listened. Instead, he acted like his usual stubborn self, and he messed it all up. Aizawa was usually a smart, somewhat kind man. He knew when he was pushing something too far. Unfortunately, not even he could read minds.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBakugou, how old were you the first time you had sex?\u201d The man asked.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Katsuki slapped a hand over his mouth, trying to muffle the answer. He began to sweat with the effort it took to hold it back, his mind beginning to fuzz out as the quirk tried to reign the control back. Deku was talking behind him, stuttering out pleas and excuses, but within five seconds, it was already too late.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFour,\u201d Katsuki wheezed. Just like that, the entire classroom went dead silent. Deku wilted back into his seat, burying his face in his hands as Katsuki growled like a feral dog, daring any of them to try to get him to elaborate on what he said.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cRepeat that, Katsuki.\u201d Aizawa said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFuck you,\u201d Bakugou spat, taking advantage of the sentence not being phrased at a question.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDid you just say you first had sex when you were \n\nfour years old\n\n?\u201d Midnight asked, her dark eyes wide with astonishment.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\n\nYes\n\n,\u201d Katsuki hissed. \u201cI was fucking four, are you fucking happy now? Jesus fuck, I told you not to fucking ask me, old man!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cKacchan,\u201d Deku said softly from behind him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cBakugou, I think we need to talk,\u201d Aizawa said, gesturing for the blond to stand up.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d Katsuki said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cActually, I can.\u201d Aizawa eyed the blond, looking more serious than he\u2019d seen the man in a long time. \u201cWe can do this the easy way or the hard way.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou wanna fucking go?\u201d Katsuki snarled, his hands beginning to pop with little fireworks. Before Aizawa could do anything else, like activate his quirk, Deku shot out of his chair and slammed his hands on his desk. \n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u201cSomeone ask me,\u201d he demanded, gathering everyone\u2019s attention. Katsuki\u2019s muscles locked up, realizing what Deku was about to do.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cProblem Child, we\u2019re a little busy now,\u201d Aizawa said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cKacchan, ask me,\u201d Deku said, his voice sounding cold. Bakugou turned to meet Deku\u2019s eyes, finding the same determination on the younger boy\u2019s face that he always got when he was facing down a villain. Some part of Katsuki was strangely glad that Deku wasn\u2019t going to let him do this alone.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDeku, how fucking old were you when you first had sex?\u201d Katsuki asked dryly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFour years old,\u201d Deku answered. The world shifted on its axis once again.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Katsuki should have known this would be a shitty day.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure you both know why you\u2019re here,\u201d Aizawa said, staring at the two young men sitting in his office. Midnight, Recovery Girl and Principal Nedzu were also attending the impromptu meeting, since Midnight was directly involved, Recovery Girl was a licensed therapist, and Principal Nedzu was always present for school matters.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI thought I said we didn\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d Kacchan grouched from the seat next to Izuku. The greenet looked to his friend with a frown, tightening his grip on his school pants. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to look at anyone but Kacchan, because he was afraid of what expressions might be on their faces. There were only two people in the entire world who knew about his and Kacchan\u2019s past, one of them being Kacchan himself.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other one was Izuku\u2019s father, Midoriya Hisashi.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell kid, you\u2019re still a minor, and since this incident isn\u2019t in your records, it\u2019s pretty apparent that neither you nor Midoriya-kun have told anyone,\u201d Midnight said gently. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided that, \n\nfor now\n\n, we won\u2019t contact your parents since we don\u2019t have the full story yet. We know that you\u2019re both still under the influence of the truth quirk, and while normally we would never do that for something like this, the two of you are rather\u2026 stubborn individuals. We think it\u2019s best to get this over with.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\n\nFuck you\n\n,\u201d Katsuki snarled. Izuku reached over to grab Katsuki\u2019s hand, his own shaking with nerves. Katsuki\u2019s hackles dropped immediately as he looked over at Izuku, red eyes searching his own for whatever he was feeling.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cKacchan,\u201d Izuku said, hearing his voice waver with the intensity of his emotions. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m so tired, Kacchan. Aren\u2019t you tired?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Katsuki opened his mouth to speak before he quickly closed it. He continued to stare at Izuku before the truth quirk forced him to speak again. \u201cYeah. Yeah, Deku, I\u2019m tired.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShouldn\u2019t we just tell them?\u201d Izuku coaxed. In all actuality, the \n\nlast \n\nthing Izuku wanted was to tell these people what had happened to him and Kacchan, but he also knew that it would probably help him heal if he got it off of his chest. For so long he and Katsuki had different methods for dealing with it; Katsuki pushed Izuku away and became a cruel, horrible person to cope with it. Izuku allowed himself to fall into a deep depression, hiding behind his quirklessess and his analysis notebooks instead of facing his fears or telling anyone about what had happened. He\u2019d believed for so long that it was all his fault, but he knew better now. Katsuki had told him multiple times since their friendship was rekindled that the blond had blamed Izuku for a while, but that he knew better now.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was nobody\u2019s fault but Hisashi\u2019s.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d Katsuki answered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cBut we should,\u201d Izuku said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Katsuki sighed heavily, more of a huff than anything else. \u201cFuckin\u2019- \n\nfine\n\n. You can fucking tell them.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Izuku nodded, taking a deep, shaky breath to prepare himself. \u201cKacchan and I have known each other since we were babies. Our mothers were college roommates and have been best friends ever since. Our families used to hang out all the time, and his home was like my second home. His parents loved me and mine loved him. We were inseparable, and we knew each other better than we knew ourselves.\u201d Izuku glanced at Katsuki, something in his chest aching at his own words. \u201cSometimes I think we still do.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Kacchan grunted in acknowledgement of Izuku\u2019s words. The tiny gesture was enough to give Izuku the strength to keep going. \u201cAnyway\u2026 When I was about three years old, maybe about to turn four, my dad started to get into some\u2026 shady things. He was gone all the time, and when he would come back to the house, he would smell like ash and death. He had a fire breathing quirk, but the way he was acting\u2026 it was like he was leaving to burn entire houses down.\u201d \u2018\n\nOr people,\u2019\n\n is what Izuku didn\u2019t say. \u201cMy mother was in denial about it, but it was pretty obvious. Sometimes I would hear my mom and Auntie arguing about forcing him to leave. God, I wish they\u2019d forced him out.\u201d Izuku\u2019s eyes began to grow wet, but he was so lost in his own storytelling that the rest of the world began fading away from him. It was like he was merely thinking to himself rather than telling a room full of teachers about what had happened to him and Kacchan.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cRight after I turned four, my father began to\u2026 \n\ntouch\n\n me.\u201d He didn\u2019t hear the sharp gasps from the adults in the room, and maybe it was good that he hadn\u2019t. Realizing he still had an audience probably would have made him lose his composure. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that what he was doing was wrong, I just knew that it made me feel bad and I didn\u2019t like it. It didn\u2019t take long for Kacchan to notice that I was acting weird, and he confronted me about it while we were at my house one day. My mother was at work so my dad was watching us. He\u2026 he overheard Kacchan and decided to get him \u2018in\u2019 on it.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhenever Kacchan would come over and my mom wasn\u2019t home from then on, my father would molest the both of us. Kacchan felt weird about it too, but he was a little hero, even back then.\u201d Izuku couldn\u2019t help but smile ruefully, mourning the loss of the brave little boy who had refused to leave him alone with his monster of a sperm donor. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to leave me alone with my dad. He stayed every time. Even\u2026 even when he started taking pictures.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh no,\u201d a voice whispered, but Izuku didn\u2019t bother to place it. He began talking faster, knowing that if he didn\u2019t get the rest of it out he would lose his momentum. He was starting to come back to himself instead of continuing his dissociation, the way he usually did when he was forced to confront what had happened to himself and Kacchan.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cEventually he started taking videos and posting them on the dark web. I\u2019m sure there are still some sickos out there who have videos and Kacchan and I, or even that they\u2019re still on the web somewhere. I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t really want to know. Right before we turned five, he\u2026 he made us have sex with each other.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Someone let out a choked out sob.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe only stopped after Kacchan got his quirk the day before his fifth birthday. A few months later, when my own quirk didn\u2019t come in, he left my mom a note saying that he couldn\u2019t deal with having a \u2018quirkless fuck\u2019 for a son. We haven\u2019t seen or heard from him since.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Aizawa said, speaking for the first time since Izuku began sharing. Izuku looked up, sweeping his eyes over everyone to take in their reactions. Kacchan was staring at his lap, his hands fisted to keep his nitroglycerin under control. Midnight appeared to be the one who was holding back tears, as she had a few wet patches on her face and a hand covering her mouth. Principal Nedzu\u2019s expression had darkened to something formidable and scary, and Recovery Girl looked sympathetic.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBakugou- Midoriya,\u201d Aizawa said again, although it seemed like it was more of a reflex. Katsuki didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever seen his homeroom teacher look so desperate before, not even when they were fighting villains. It was like the man was grasping at straws on what he was supposed to say to them after the admission.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGuess you fuckin\u2019 know why we didn\u2019t want to talk about it, huh?\u201d Katsuki snapped. He knew he was being unfair and vicious, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care. He had \n\nwarned\n\n Aizawa not to ask him, but he had anyway. Sure, he could have worded it better, but the man should have known him by that point.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2026 I sincerely apologize for forcing you to speak in front of your class,\u201d Eraserhead said after a few moments of awkward silence. \u201cI should have listened to you when you asked not to speak. I thought that you were simply embarrassed about your answer, I \n\nnever\n\n thought\u2026\u201d he trailed off, his face paling a bit.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Izuku sniffled at Katsuki\u2019s side, reaching up to rub at his eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t lie and say that it\u2019s okay, because it really isn\u2019t. And I won\u2019t lie and say that I forgive you, because I don\u2019t. Not yet. But I also recognize that Kacchan and I needed to tell someone what happened to us some day, and that it was probably best that it was you as opposed to our parents.\u201d Izuku\u2019s head snapped up, his eyes wide with realization. \u201cOh god, you\u2019re not going to tell our parents, are you?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Katsuki stiffened right along with him, shooting a menacing glare at all of the adults in the room. \u201cYou had \n\nbetter\n\n not fucking tell, or I swear to the gods-\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBoys,\u201d Recovery Girl said sternly. \u201cThe two of you are still minors. I apologize, but we are \n\nlegally obligated\n\n to tell your parents.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh gods,\u201d Deku said, slumping back into his seat. He appeared to be in shock at the news, his gnarled fingers twitching where they grasped at his thighs. \u201cOh gods, oh gods- I can\u2019t let her know, she\u2019ll be so sad, what if she-? No, no she wouldn\u2019t, not after last time\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOi, Deku,\u201d Katsuki hissed, reaching over to tangle his fingers in Deku\u2019s mass of curls. He tightened his grip, pulling lightly to get Izuku\u2019s attention. It was something he\u2019d been doing for as long as he could remember. Something about lightly tugging on the boy\u2019s hair always brought him back to earth, causing his shoulders to slump into a relaxed, tension-free state. Katsuki didn\u2019t like to think about where such a reaction might have originated. \u201cYou need to fuckin\u2019 breathe, alright? Auntie\u2019s not gonna do\u2026 \n\nthat\n\n again. She knows better now.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deku inhaled sharply, exhaling slowly. He nodded, blinking rapidly as if to clear his head. \u201cY-yeah. Yeah, you\u2019re right, I know you\u2019re right\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat are you boys talking about?\u201d Midnight\u2019s voice sounded defensive. \u201cWhat has your mother done, Midoriya? Has she ever hurt you, as well?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cW-what? No!\u201d Izuku shot up straight in his chair, forcing Katsuki to let go of his chair. \u201cNo, no of course not! She would never hurt me!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Deku didn\u2019t say anything else but the adults still seemed to be waiting for an answer Katsuki figured it was time for him to step in. Sighing, he began. \u201cAfter Deku\u2019s piece of shit sperm donor left, Auntie Inko was\u2026 pretty messed up. She had to get a high-stress job to support them, and she began stress eating. She gained like, fifty pounds in a few months and had a really terrible mental state. When we were about six, she\u2026 she tried to kill herself. Deku found her body and called the cops. She hasn\u2019t tried anything since then.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Principal Nedzu sat back in his chair, lacing his fingers together. He seemed grim, it was creepy. Katsuki had never seen him without that strange, manic smile on his face.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry you went through that,\u201d Recovery Girl said gently. Deku nodded.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s fine. It was all a long, \n\nlong\n\n time ago.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTime doesn\u2019t heal all wounds,\u201d Aizawa recited, like it was a mantra he told himself. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to still be upset. Those were \n\nvery\n\n traumatic experiences for you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re fucking fine,\u201d Katsuki snarled. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just leave it alone? If you tell our parents then it\u2019s going to become a big \n\nthing\n\n, and that\u2019s the last thing we need right before midterms.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Midnight nodded in understanding, but Aizawa-sensei didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re legally obligated to report it. I\u2019m sorry boys, but it\u2019s non-negotiable. I suggest that the two of you skip classes for the rest of the day and rest in the dorms. Perhaps come up with a cover story to tell your classmates.\u201d He really \n\ndid\n\n look sorry about that, not that it made anything better. Katsuki agreed with Deku about not forgiving the man just yet, no matter his reasoning for what he\u2019d done.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFine. We\u2019re fucking leaving,\u201d Bakugou said. He stood up and didn\u2019t wait for Deku before storming out of the office. He wasn\u2019t surprised when Deku appeared at his side a moment later, practically jogging to keep up with Katsuki\u2019s fast footsteps.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cKacchan, wait,\u201d Deku squeaked. \u201cWe need to talk about this!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot until we\u2019re in the dorms,\u201d Bakugou growled, quickening his pace even more. Deku\u2019s legs were a lot shorter than Katsuki\u2019s these days, as over the past year Katsuki\u2019s height had shot up from 5\u20198\u201d to nearly 6\u20190\u201d, and Deku had stayed at his 5\u20195\u201d. Luckily, Deku didn\u2019t test Katsuki and stayed quiet until they entered the empty dorm\u2019s common room. It was too bad there wasn\u2019t a door to slam, because it would have been \n\nreally\n\n satisfying to do it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cKacchan,\u201d Deku said softly, standing near one of the couches as he watched Katsuki pace the floor.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t fucking \n\nbelieve\n\n he did that,\u201d Bakugou hissed, his anger and hurt rising in his chest like an active volcano. \u201cI fucking told him not to ask, didn\u2019t I? I didn\u2019t go fucking deaf?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou did,\u201d Deku agreed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDamn right I did!\u201d Katsuki\u2019s hands were beginning to spark now. \u201cAnd now all those fucking \n\nextras\n\n know. How the fuck are we supposed to explain that shit? There\u2019s no reason that two four year-olds would do something like that unless they were forced!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cKacchan, we don\u2019t \n\nhave\n\n to tell them anything,\u201d Deku tried to soothe him. \u201cWe can tell them to leave it alone.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIf you really think they\u2019ll listen, you\u2019re more naive than I thought,\u201d Katsuki sneered. The moment he did it he felt bad, especially watching the greenet\u2019s face fall. He sighed like it was a great pain, rubbing the heels of his hands over his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t fucking mean that, alright? I\u2019m fucking pissed.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI know,\u201d Deku sighed. \u201cI\u2019m angry too.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Katsuki couldn\u2019t help but snort. \u201cYou have a funny way of showing it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Izuku couldn\u2019t help but laugh too. \u201cJust because I don\u2019t explode my feelings away doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not angry.\u201d His smile fell into a more serious expression. \u201cSometimes\u2026 Sometimes I get so \n\nmad\n\n\u2026 it scares me, Kacchan.\u201d He took a deep, shuddering breath before he exhaled just as shakily. \u201cI see incidents like when we rescued Eri, where it\u2019s just a little kid covered in scars, and it\u2019s like I can\u2019t help myself. I genuinely tried to\n\n kill\n\n Overhaul.\u201d He seemed ashamed of this admission, but Katsuki wasn\u2019t having it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAs you should have,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cDeku, that guy was a piece of shit villain. Are you honestly trying to tell me that if All Might was still alive, he wouldn\u2019t track Hisashi down and kill that motherfucker? You and I both know Hisashi would be dead within twenty-four hours.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deku laughed, although it was more of a strained sound than anything else. \u201cI know. It\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt is,\u201d Katsuki affirmed. \u201cBut whatever, that doesn\u2019t matter now. We have three hours until lunch, and we both know the entire fucking class is going to come running here the minute that bell rings. So, use that nerdy brain of yours to figure out a cover story.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deku was quiet for some time. Katsuki combed through his own mind to try thinking of something plausible, but it was pretty much pointless. There was no explanation for what they\u2019d admitted to unless it was the truth.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe should just tell them,\u201d Deku finally said. Katsuki\u2019s head snapped up, a scowl already forming. Deku held up a hand placatingly. \u201cHear me out. I think we should tell them because they\u2019re our \n\nfriends\n\n, Kacchan. They would never, \n\never\n\n judge us for the truth and you know it. We all know about Todoroki-kun\u2019s story, and no one judged him. We all know about Shinsou-kun\u2019s terrible experience in foster care before Aizawa-sensei and Present Mic-sensei adopted him, and everyone supported him. Of course we all know about Eri, too. There\u2019s overwhelming evidence that they would care about us and support us, too!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah? Well none of \n\nthem\n\n have sex videos of themselves on the internet somewhere,\u201d Katsuki hissed. \u201cDo you have any idea what this could do to our career as heroes? If any of them were to slip up and tell someone? We would be \n\ncrucified.\n\n They won\u2019t care that we were children, they\u2019ll just care that they have a story.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThey would know better than to tell,\u201d Izuku said. Logically Katsuki knew he was right, but he also didn\u2019t want any of his peers to know his deepest, darkest secret. \u2018\n\nMy biggest failure. The real reason I stopped talking to Deku all those years ago. Because\u2026\u2019\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFucking- \n\nfine\n\n,\u201d Katsuki said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not saying shit. You\u2019re on your own for this one.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Despite the threat, Deku still had the nerve to look fucking relieved. \u201cThank you, Kacchan. Thank you for trusting me.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The words stung, because even though the two of them had been closer than ever after All Might\u2019s death at the beginning of their second year, it was only because he was one of the only living people that knew about One for All. The sad truth was that after everything Katsuki had done to Izuku\u2026 he would never trust Katsuki the way Katsuki trusted him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At least by the time their class barged in from lunch, the truth quirk will have worn off. It was a small consolation.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kirishima Eijirou liked to think that he was a good friend. He hadn\u2019t had many friends in middle school due to him being bullied, but when he\u2019d gotten into U.A., he\u2019d done everything in his power to be the best friend he could be to everyone in his class. (Well, except Mineta. No one liked Mineta, and they had literally thrown a party when the little dude had been expelled and replaced with Shinsou Hitoshi.)\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eijirou liked to think that his friends didn\u2019t keep any secrets from him, but he supposed that was just unrealistic. Still, a secret like \n\nthis\n\n was astronomical, and for it to be a secret from \n\ntwo\n\n of his friends, both of which he was very close with? He would be lying if he said he didn\u2019t feel a little betrayed. Logically he knew that they had to have a reason to keep their secrets, but still\u2026\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say, Eijirou was the first one into the dorm building after the lunch bell rang. They had another forty minutes to talk to Midoriya and Bakugou before they would have to go back to class, but Eijirou figured that was plenty of time. He was far from the only one who wanted answers. His girlfriends, Mina and Ochako, Kaminari, Todoroki, Sero and Iida were all right behind him, being integral parts of the Bakusquad and the Dekusquad. Shinsou and Tsu had stayed a bit farther behind with the rest of the group to try and calm down the rumours that were already flying.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bursting into the common room, the first thing that Kirishima saw was Bakugou and Midoriya sitting on the middle-most couch, their shoulders, arms and thighs touching from how close they were sitting. The both of them looked up, faces grim at the sight of their classmates flooding into the building. They both stood, moving to a vantage point where they could see everyone when they all sat on the three long couches and few arm chairs that surrounded the flat screen television. Everyone stayed silent as they filed in, taking places on the couches, chairs and floor space around where the twin stars stood. Eijirou was no exception, settling onto the couch directly across from the two of them, his girlfriends on either side. Clearly they were expecting something horrible to be revealed, if the way they both immediately grabbed at either of his arms was any indication. Honestly, Eijirou wasn\u2019t expecting anything pleasant, either.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once everyone was settled in and staring at the two of them, Kirishima realized that someone would have to be the one to break the silence. He cleared his throat, sitting up a bit before speaking. \u201cWell\u2026 I think we\u2019re all here for the same reason.\u201d He tried to crack a half-hearted smile, but nobody reciprocated it. He sighed, reaching to rub at the tense space between his eyes. \u201cJust\u2026 what the two of you admitted earlier was really, \n\nreally\n\n disturbing, alright? We all want to know what the fuck that was about.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It wasn\u2019t often that Kirishima swore. Nobody in Class 2-A swore as much as Bakugou, and nobody else swore as little as Midoriya, but Kirishima definitely leaned more towards Midoriya\u2019s end of the spectrum than his best friends\u2019. The redhead could feel his girlfriends tense at his use of the f-word, but he kept his eyes firmly on his friends.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell,\u201d Izuku finally said slowly, looking at Katsuki out of the corner of his eye. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a bit of a long story, if you\u2019re all willing to listen.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe are,\u201d Mina said before anyone else could speak. The rest of them nodded vigorously, a few of them even shifting to get more comfortable in their seats, like they really were preparing for the long haul. Hagakure had curled herself around her boyfriend\u2019s tail, Kaminari had laced his fingers tightly with Shinsou\u2019s and Todoroki\u2019s, who was on his other side. Tokoyami nestled into his arm chair like a bird in its nest, which wasn\u2019t exactly a far stretch.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI guess\u2026 it all begins with my father,\u201d Izuku sighed. \u201cIt was actually Kacchan\u2019s father than introduced my mom to him. Our moms were college roommates you see, so we\u2019ve literally been with each other for our entire lives. Like, seriously, three month old Kacchan was in the waiting room when I was being born.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBest three months of my life,\u201d Katsuki muttered, although the slightly fond look he gave Izuku discounted his words.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShut up. Anyway, when I was about three years old, my father started acting\u2026 strange. His quirk was Fire Breathing, and sometimes he would randomly leave during the day, only to come back smelling like he\u2019d just basked in his own fire. Looking back on it, I\u2019m pretty sure he was a serial arsonist that the police had tried looking for.\u201d Izuku winced, like he was expecting judgement for something his father did. \u201cMy mom wanted to believe that he was a good guy, so she always pretended like she didn\u2019t know anything was wrong. Because she pretended, I pretended too.\u201d Midoriya paused, looking down at his feet. He took a few moments to gather up the courage to say what he said next. \u201cWhen I was about three and a half, he began\u2026 \n\ntouching \n\nme. The way no adult should touch a kid.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gasps rang throughout the room, but Kirishima could hardly hear them through the blood roaring in his ears. His eyes instinctually flickered to Bakugou, who was looking right back at him with a hard expression, as if daring him to say something to offend Midoriya. Eijirou met his eyes with an equally tough look. Of course he would never say something about what Midoriya had gone through. If anything, it only made Kirishima respect his friend \n\nmore\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMidori\u2026\u201d Mina said softly, her grip on his bicep tightening. Izuku ignored her, his voice getting faster and louder as he continued.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnyway, um. I started acting weird, because I knew that what he was doing was wrong. But since my mom always pretended like nothing was wrong, I guess some part of me didn\u2019t want to say anything to her? That, and my father always warned me not to tell, because it would make my mom cry.\u201d Izuku\u2019s voice wavered. \u201cI\u2026 I just didn\u2019t want to make her cry.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had to take deep breaths to try and calm himself down, but after the first seven of them, Bakugou apparently got restless and began speaking in Midoriya\u2019s place. If the expression on the smaller male\u2019s face was anything to go by, then clearly Katsuki had told Izuku that he wouldn't explain anything in the story. It sounded like something Bakugou would do.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBasically, three year old me was just as fucking smart as present day me. I knew that something was fucking wrong with Deku, because I spent every single day with the prick in some way or another.\u201d He rolled his eyes to the ceiling, like his next words physically pained him. \u201cHe\u2026 he was my best friend.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018\n\nHe finally admitted it,\u2019\n\n Kirishima thought, somewhat gleefully despite the tense situation.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI guess one day I decided to confront Deku about what the fuck was going on. He\u2019d already been hiding it for a few months by then, so he was about ready to explode by the time I asked him. He told me the truth, that his dad was doing fucking disgusting things to him. Unfortunately for us both, Hisashi- his father- was around to hear him tattle, and decided to bring me in on it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m gonna throw up,\u201d Sero whimpered, but still didn\u2019t move from his spot. A few of their peers around him nodded along, sharing his sentiment. Kirishima was vaguely aware of bile sliding up his own throat, but he refused to show any weakness in the face of his friends\u2019 obvious bravery. It took a lot for them to admit this to their class, and Eijirou wasn\u2019t about to disrespect them by chickening out.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe were four when he started taking pictures and videos of us to sell online,\u201d Midoriya chimed back in, his eyes shimmering with unshed tears. \u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 they\u2019re probably still out there somewhere, honestly.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And wasn\u2019t \n\nthat\n\n fucked up? That some creeps all over the world had videos of \n\nthat\n\n nature of some of the best heroes Kirishima knew? And nothing had been done to stop it? It made his stomach churn.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe started making us have sex with each other,\u201d Katsuki spat out, his palms beginning to spark. \u201cHe sold those videos too. Probably kept some for himself like the fucking sick \n\nfreak\n\n he is.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cKacchan,\u201d Midoriya said, reaching over to grab one of Katsuki\u2019s wrist. The blond wrenched the appendage out of the greenet\u2019s hand, shaking it out and forcing himself to stop using his quirk.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAlright, alright!\u201d The volatile boy sighed. \u201cAnyway. Right before I turned five, I got my quirk. You can guess that fire breath and nitroglycerin don\u2019t go well together, so he started being a fucking coward and left us alone.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot long after that, he left my mom and I, and we haven\u2019t seen him since,\u201d Midoriya finished. He finally looked back up shyly, meeting everyone\u2019s eyes. \u201cSo\u2026 that\u2019s why we said we had sex when we were four years old. As far as I know, neither of us have done it since.\u201d He looked at Katsuki for confirmation.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWho the fuck would I fuck, Deku?\u201d Katsuki shuddered like the thought repulsed him. The sad thing was, it probably did. All thoughts of sex for these two were muddled and ruined by fear, revulsion and guilt, rather than anything pleasant. Considering the kind of person Bakugou was, Eijirou wouldn\u2019t even be surprised if the guy hadn\u2019t even jerked off before.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so terribly sorry that happened to you both,\u201d Yaoyorozu said, breaking through the thick layer of tension between them all. Katsuki turned to sneer at her, but seemed to think better of it as he got a glimpse of the look on the tall girl\u2019s face. Yaoyorozu stood up, taking a deep, shaky breath.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not in any way saying it\u2019s the same thing,\u201d she began, \u201cbut I was also sexually assaulted when I was thirteen years old. So I\u2026 I know how the\u2026 \n\ninvasiveness\u2026\n\n feels.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYaomomo!\u201d Jirou, her girlfriend, looked horrified. Looking around, it was pretty obvious that this was news to them all. Well, all of them except Izuku.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI know,\u201d he said gently. Yaomomo looked shocked.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow could you possibly know? I\u2019ve never told anyone before!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Izuku reached to rub at the back of his neck nervously. \u201cWell\u2026 I think I\u2019ve mentioned before that my quirk developed really late? When we all thought I was quirkless, I kind of considered becoming a sexual assault therapist. I kind of trained myself to look for the signs of a sexual assault survivor, so\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh yeah, you said that before,\u201d Kaminari commented. \u201cThe quirk thing, anyway. Hey, when \n\ndid\n\n your quirk develop, dude?\u201d It was obvious the electric blond was trying to change the subject to something a little less personal, and Eijirou couldn\u2019t help but be thankful for it. Especially since he\u2019d always been curious about that little fact himself.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Midoriya looked at Bakugou, who only shrugged in return. \u201cI kind of\u2026 developed it right at the end of the entrance exam?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2026 you took the entrance exam when you still thought you were quirkless?\u201d Iida squawked, seeming to snap out of his trance at this admission. Midoriya wilted a bit, biting his lower lip. \u201cMidoriya-kun, that is so unbelievably dangerous! Considering you broke both of your legs and your right arm, it\u2019s a wonder you didn\u2019t end up dead! Those robots could have crushed you-\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHey, let\u2019s not forget that he saved my life,\u201d Ochako declared, standing up and putting her hands on her hips. She glared at a cowed Iida for a moment before she turned to Bakugou and Midoriya. \u201cAnd\u2026 Deku-kun, you already know this, but I was also sexually assaulted when I was fifteen, right before getting into U.A..\u201d She looked at Katsuki as she said it, raising an eyebrow. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing, but I\u2019m \n\nnot\n\n weak for it.\u201d \u2018\n\nAnd neither are you,\u2019\n\n was unsaid.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t say shit,\u201d Bakugou said, holding his hands up. Then he frowned, his brow furrowing a bit. \u201c...Fucking\u2026 fine. If any of you extras have any questions or some shit, you\u2019d better ask them now, because after this I\u2019m never talking about this \n\never again\n\n.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was quiet for a few moments before Asui spoke, raising her hand like they were still in class. \u201cDo you know where you father is? An address perhaps? For purely educational reasons.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Midoriya couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cNo. All I know is that he\u2019s in America.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s probably for the better,\u201d Todoroki said gravely. \u201cWe don\u2019t need Iida to attempt to kill someone for the second time.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cExcuse me, did you just say for the \n\nsecond time\n\n?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCan I ask something kind of personal?\u201d Shinsou cut in. Bakugou met the purple haired boy\u2019s eyes, slowly nodding his assent. \u201cAre you both okay? Both mentally and\u2026 physically. You were\u2026 you were pretty little back then.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eijirou hadn\u2019t even thought of that. Their tiny bodies probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle something like that. For the umpteenth time that day, bile rose in his throat like a tidal wave.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Bakugou said, shrugging. \u201cAm I fucking messed up in the head? Of fucking course I am. There\u2019s a fucking reason I\u2019m such a douche bag.\u201d They all stared at him with wide eyes, to which he smirked. \u201cWhat? You thought I didn\u2019t \n\nknow\n\n?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2026\u201d Midoriya swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 not alright. Physically speaking.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Bakugou whipped around to stare at him, his mouth open slightly. \u201cWhat the fuck? What the fuck are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Midoriya bit his lower lip hard enough to draw a few beads of blood, causing Eijirou to wince at the sympathetic pain. \u201cKacchan\u2026 I never told you because I didn\u2019t want to make things harder for you to deal with.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou never told me \n\nwhat\n\n, Deku?\u201d Bakugou\u2019s voice was hard, but there was an underlying tone of desperation that gave Eijirou the feeling that he should look away; like it was something private, for their eyes only.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhen my dad forced us to\u2026\u201d he swallowed, shaking his head a bit. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the only time that I\u2026 what I\u2019m trying to say is that he also\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even someone as low in class as Mina knew what Midoriya wasn\u2019t saying, if her fingernails suddenly digging into his bicep meant anything.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bakugou\u2019s eyes were wide with an emotion Kirishima had never seen on him before; panic, or maybe fear. Whatever it was, it didn\u2019t fit on his face, and a pit of dread began to form inside of Eijirou.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy the \n\nfuck\n\n wouldn\u2019t you tell me that?\u201d Katsuki wasn\u2019t yelling, which almost made it worse. His voice was quiet, his tone shaking a bit with the strain. Midoriya hung his head like he was ashamed, rubbing at his gnarled, scarred right arm shyly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBecause you were already pulling away from me,\u201d the smaller boy admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t want you to feel like you had to stay to protect me.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI was \n\nthere\n\n to protect you,\u201d Katsuki snapped, finally returning to his usual demeanor. \u201cThe whole reason I was there was to fucking protect you! How the fuck was I supposed to do that if you didn\u2019t tell me shit?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBecause the last time I told you what was happening to me, he brought you in on it!\u201d Midoriya\u2019s voice rose to match Katsuki\u2019s. Kirishima began to realize that their fight was really something they should discuss in private, and yet he couldn\u2019t bring himself to walk away. It was like he was rooted to his spot. \u201cDo you know what he did to me, Kacchan? He fucked me so hard that he broke my tailbone. I had internal bleeding for \n\ndays\n\n because he literally readjusted my organs because I was so little.\u201d By this point, Midoriya was crying. It wasn\u2019t like his usual tears though; it was silent, almost like an afterthought rather than the focal point. Usually when Midoriya cried, he put all of his focus on trying to stop so that he wouldn\u2019t embarrass himself. He obviously didn\u2019t care this time.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bakugou looked sick at his violent description of what happened, and so was the rest of the class. Ochako looked about as green as she did when she exceeded her quirk\u2019s weight limit, and Mina had begun trembling a long time ago.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t believe you would keep something like this from me,\u201d Bakugou spoke, sounding more like a child than Eijirou had ever heard. It reminded him that in the long run of life, the blond \n\nwas\n\n still a child.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah? And what was I supposed to do? Come up to you and say \u2018Oh Kacchan, by the way, right before my dad ran away like the coward he was, he raped me. Please, help me!\u2019\u201d Midoriya shook his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even five years old, Kacchan, I didn\u2019t even know the word for what he was doing. \n\nExcuse me\n\n for wanting to keep you out of it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re such a fucking martyr,\u201d Katsuki growled. \u201cYou never care about anyone else, or how your actions could affect them! You just throw yourself in front of danger like a fucking kamikaze!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell gee, I wonder where that developed!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou guys,\u201d Ochako squeaked, breaking the two of them out of the little bubble they had created. Izuku went pale at the realization that all eighteen of them had just heard everything he and Katsuki had said, his freckles standing out comically against his new pallor. Bakugou didn\u2019t seem to care, too fuming mad to acknowledge anyone but Izuku.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kirishima stood up, shuffling towards his best friend. He hardened his body before he laid a light hand on Bakugou\u2019s shoulder, causing the boy\u2019s head to snap to him. Eijirou made sure to keep his expression soft and even, but his body hardened in case of an attack. After the Overhaul incident, Eijirou of all people knew how feeling cornered could result in quirk accidents. \u201cDude. I think you and Midori-bro need some time to process, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Katsuki\u2019s lips pulled into a sneer and he jerked his shoulder out from underneath the redhead\u2019s hand, but he still turned his back to the lot of them and stalked towards the staircase that led to the boys\u2019 side of the dorms, completely bypassing the elevator. Knowing him, he was going to use the walk to the fourth floor to try and calm himself down.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Iida had stood up from his seat on one of the other couches, approaching Midoriya like he was a wounded animal. \u201cMidor- \n\nIzuku-kun\n\n. I think it would be best for everyone if I escorted you to your room for some sleep.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Izuku seemed dazed as he stared out into the middle of the room, just above everyone\u2019s heads. He automatically nodded at the sound of Iida\u2019s voice, although he was clearly dissociating. Iida knew it too, and he took advantage of it, gently taking Midoriya\u2019s arm to lead him to the elevator. Midoriya only lived on the second floor and usually took the stairs, but he was in no condition to do so now.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pretty soon, the elevator doors slid shut behind the two boys, leaving only seventeen of them left to process what they had just heard. Kirishima slid back down onto his spot between his girlfriends, his mind finally beginning to numb as he tried to run through everything two of his best friends had just told them.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yeah. There was no way they were going back to class.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Bakugou Mitsuki sat in between her best friend and her husband, anxiety gnawing at her insides. She hadn\u2019t been called to a meeting at Katsuki\u2019s school since the boy had been kidnapped in his first year, and from the grave tone Principal Nedzu had used, whatever they were called to talk about wasn\u2019t good. Considering her best friend, Midoriya Inko, was there for the same meeting, obviously it had something to do with little Izuku also.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mitsuki decided that breaking the ice might be a good idea to calm them all down. \u201cSo. Do you think our sons finally got caught fucking each other?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Masaru\u2019s jaw dropped, his eyes growing comically wide. Inko\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t much different, the both of them staring at Mitsuki like she was crazy. She cackled at their reactions, bending over in her chair to clutch at her gut. She never got tired of using her coarse personality and language to fluster her shy friend and soft husband. It was something she loved most about them.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMitsuki\u2026\u201d Masaru sighed, reaching up to take off his glasses and rub between his eyes. Mitsuki scoffed, wiping underneath her eyes for any tears that may have slipped during her laughing fit.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, come on! Those two have been dancing around each other since they could \n\nspeak\n\n! It would be about time that they finally admitted their feelings!\u201d She knew she was right, looking to Inko for help.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Inko looked pale, a hand pressed against her mouth like she was scandalized. \u201cOh Mitsuki- you don\u2019t really think my little Izu has been doing something like \n\nthat\n\n, do you? I haven\u2019t even given him the talk yet!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe know honey,\u201d Mitsuki drawled, reaching over to pat Inko\u2019s knee. \u201cI had Masaru give him the talk at the same time as Katsuki. Also, you\u2019re crazy if you think a seventeen year old boy doesn\u2019t know what sex is.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHoney, please stop giving our best friend an existential crisis,\u201d Masaru pleaded. Indeed, Inko looked like she was on the verge of fainting. Mitsuk couldn\u2019t help but laugh some more.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then suddenly, the door to the conference room opened and a crowd began filing in. Mitsuki recognized them as the higher-ups of U.A. Academy; the Principal, Recovery Girl, Eraserhead, Present Mic and Midnight. The latter three were also first-year teachers, if Mitsuki remembered correctly. She sat up straight, trying to look like she hadn\u2019t just been riling up her significant other and her friend, and both Inko and Masaru did the same, looking like they hadn\u2019t just been riled up. The last to enter the room were their sons, both of them with their heads hung down like they were ashamed. Oh yeah. That was \n\ndefinitely\n\n a walk of shame. Mitsuki was looking forward to this.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To her surprise though, neither of the boys sat next to their parents, instead sitting as far away from them as they possibly could around the large table. It made Mitsuki frown in confusion, and she tried to catch Katsuki\u2019s eye, but the brat was stubbornly only looking at Izuku. They both looked like they were sweating bullets, and Izuku\u2019s eyes were rimmed with red, like he\u2019d been crying for the better part of the day. It was a pretty normal look for the youngest Midoriya, so normally Mitsuki wouldn\u2019t think anything of it\u2026 except that her own son\u2019s eyes looked suspiciously puffy as well. Like they\u2019d \n\nboth\n\n been crying.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly, her anxiety came back full-force. Something was very, \n\nvery \n\nwrong.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so glad you three could come on such short notice,\u201d Principal Nedzu said good naturedly, although his smile looked a little strained. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that something rather\u2026 distressing has come to light yesterday, and we are legally obligated to tell you three.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d Mitsuki looked at Katsuki, who finally met her eyes, his own red gaze staring into hers. He wasn\u2019t challenging her with his eyes like he normally would; instead, his eyes looked\u2026 \n\nnervous.\n\n It unsettled her greatly, and all she wanted to do was launch herself across the table to pull him into the world\u2019s tightest hug. It had been a long time since Katsuki had let himself be vulnerable- had let himself be a \n\nkid\n\n- long enough that sometimes, Mitsuki forgot that he still was a kid.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYesterday morning, Midnight and I held a sex ed class,\u201d Eraserhead began, settling deeper into his seat as he laced his fingers together on top of the conference table. \u201cWe were instructed by Principal Nedzu to ask the students questions about their sexual activity within the dorm rooms so that we could accurately teach on the subject. We aren\u2019t ignorant to think that our kids aren\u2019t fooling around in the dorms, and we wanted to educate them so that at least if they\u2019re going to have sex, they could do it safely and consensually.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat sounds reasonable,\u201d Masaru nodded, reaching over to squeeze Mitsuki\u2019s hand with his own.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYes, we thought so too. However, to avoid any lying, we brought in an interrogation hero who has a truth quirk. We asked the students if they were comfortable with being put under the quirk, and they all said yes. Including your sons.\u201d Eraserhead seemed to want to make this part clear, which confused Mitsuki. Of course her son wasn\u2019t going to get out of it, especially if all of his classmates were already going under the quirk.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI suppose we should just come right out and say it,\u201d Midnight cut in, her eyes flicking between the two teenagers and their parents. \u201cWe asked a question regarding when the first time the students had sex was, and when the last time was, so we could accurately guage how much they may already know. Your sons\u2026 your sons both confessed to losing their virginities at four years old.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mitsuki swore the entire world froze in an instant. All of her breath left her lungs, and she couldn\u2019t for the life of her inhale any more air. This was one thousand times worse than when her baby was kidnapped, because at least then, she knew that Katsuki could take care of himself. There wasn\u2019t anyone she knew that could beat Katsuki, and shitty villains were included in that. But this\u2026 Katsuki had been four years old. He hadn\u2019t even had his quirk yet, until a few days before his fifth birthday! And little Izuku\u2026 he hadn\u2019t developed his quirk until he was \n\nfifteen years old\n\n. But if they had both had sex at four years old, then what did that mean\u2026?\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMom? Mom!\u201d Katsuki\u2019s voice broke her out of her thoughts, and she finally inhaled, sucking in so much air that she choked. She felt lightheaded, and she realized that she must have been out of it for longer than she\u2019d thought. All of the people around the room looked worried, but Mitsuki didn\u2019t give a fuck about them. She kept her eyes locked on Katsuki\u2019s, inhaling and exhaling along with Masaru, who was trying to guide her with one of her hands pressed against his chest.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWho?\u201d She asked her son, trying to keep her voice soft, rather than its usual haughtiness.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Katsuki studied her expression for a while, his mouth set in a firm line that mirrored her own. Gods, he really was her spitting image. He had enough of his father in him that he looked like a boy, with his sharp jawline and strong nose, but still somewhat feminine like her, as well. He had her upturned eyes, her full, soft lips, and her high cheekbones. When he was a child he had been catnip for little old ladies, and her own modelling agency alike. Had some creeper taken advantage of her baby without her knowledge?\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt was Hisashi,\u201d Katsuki confessed. His eyes flicked to either side of Mitsuki, no doubt to check Masaru and Inko\u2019s reactions. Mitsuki didn\u2019t look away from him, even when she heard her soft-hearted husband begin to cry. Inko was oddly silent at her side, although Mitsuki could tell that the woman was holding her breath. She was likely still in shock.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Katsuki looked away from them all, turning to Izuku. The poor boy was paler than Mitsuki herself, which was really saying something. Izuku had always been a sun-kissed child, tan from his time outside and covered in freckles, just like his father.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHis father. Midoriya Hisashi\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIzukkun?\u201d Her voice wavered when she said his name. Izuku was like a second son to her. She\u2019d loved him from the moment her best friend had given birth to him in that hospital room, and secretly always hoped that her son would get his head out of his ass and realize that he loved Izuku. The thought of either of her boys being taken advantage of by someone who was supposed to protect them\u2026\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Izuku met her gaze, his emerald eyes shimmering with unshed tears. His lower lip was wobbling, but to her shock, he wasn\u2019t crying. He looked oddly strong sitting there, his shoulders pushed back and his chin held high.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMy dad\u2026 he molested me for a few months before he brought Kacchan in on it,\u201d the boy told her. Mitsuki\u2019s heart shattered for the third time in the last few minutes, but she met Izuku\u2019s strength with her own. If Masaru was going to break and Inko was going to freeze, then Mitsuki would need to be the adult here. \u201cHe\u2026 he made Kacchan and I have sex with each other. He videotaped it and sold it to his friends.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAre you meaning to tell me that strangers out there have \n\nvideos\n\n of my \n\nunderage sons\n\n?\u201d Mitsuki turned to the heroes in the room. \u201cIs anything being done about this?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBakugou-san, we have our best people tracking down any videos we can find,\u201d Midnight soothed. \u201cWe\u2019ve already began combing through any large sums of money that Hisashi may have received during that time period, and where that money may have come from.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe can\u2019t guarantee that we\u2019ll find all of it, but we are doing our very best,\u201d Present Mic spoke for the first time. It was always odd for Mitsuki to see the man out of his loud, cheerful persona, but she also knew that he was a true hero first and foremost, and an entertainer second. They all were.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIzuku\u2026\u201d Inko squeaked. All eyes turned to the green haired woman, who was dabbing at her eyes with her long sleeves. \u201cIzuku, I\u2019m so, so \n\nsorry\n\n.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And that\u2026 that didn\u2019t sound right. That didn\u2019t sound like Inko apologizing for Izuku having to go through all of that at such a young age. That\u2026 that sounded like Inko being \n\nguilty\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cInko,\u201d Mitsuki said slowly, horror beginning to dawn on her \n\nagain\n\n. \u201cWhy are you apologizing?\u201d It seemed to hit Mitsuki like a bus all of a sudden. \u201cDid you\u2026 did you \n\nknow\n\n what that bastard was doing to our kids?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inko winced at the accusation, staring down at her lap. She was clenching her hands now, flexing and unflexing her fingers. A quick glance at Izuku and Katsuki showed that they looked just as shocked as the rest of them felt, and briefly, Mitsuki considered that she\u2019d been wrong at her accusation. But with one more look at her best friend, she knew that she wasn\u2019t wrong.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Izuku,\u201d Inko sniffled. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry. He\u2026 he threatened me, threatened \n\nyou\n\n. I didn\u2019t know what else to do, and when you came to me right before he left and you were bleeding everywhere\u2026 I never thought that he would rape you! I just- I just thought he would touch you a bit\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d Masaru said, sharper than Mitsuki had ever heard him speak. \u201cInko. \n\nNo\n\n. Tell me you didn\u2019t. You did \n\nnot\n\n let him do that to our sons.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know Katsuki was in on it!\u201d Inko said, turning to plead with her friends. \u201cIf I had known- if I had known-\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThen what?\u201d Mitsuki asked, her hands beginning to tremble. \u201cThen you would have tried harder? Why in the world wouldn\u2019t you try for your \n\nown son\n\n?\u201d It just didn\u2019t add up for her, no matter how she looked at it. \u201cI\u2019ve always looked at Izuku like he was my own. If I had known Hisashi was doing that to him, regardless of if Katsuki was involved, I would have \n\nmurdered him myself\n\n. But you\u2026 you \n\nlet\n\n him? You let him traumatize our children?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know what else to do,\u201d Inko whimpered, burying her face in her hands. \u201cPlease, I didn\u2019t think Izuku would \n\nremember\n\n. He was so young, and we needed the money\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMom,\u201d Izuku croaked, his tears finally letting loose. \u201cMom, how could you let him do that to me? You \n\nknew\n\n? You knew the entire time?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat the \n\nfuck \n\nAuntie?\u201d Katsuki\u2019s voice was so loud that it made all of the flinch, especially when he screeched his chair back and slammed his sparking hands onto the conference table. His pale skin was beginning to turn a blotchy red with his fury, another trait he\u2019d gotten from her. \u201cYou let him rape Deku? He was practically a fucking baby!\u201d Katsuki moved like he was going to lunge across the table, causing Inko to shriek and lurch backwards in her seat. Eraserhead just barely caught Katsuki in his bindings, pinning the boy's hands to his sides with a wrap over his mouth to silence him. Present Mic and Midnight were already standing, staring at Inko as more tears fell down her face.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to ask you to come with us,\u201d Present Mic said, his voice and face uncharacteristically stern. Inko whipped her head up, shock present on her face.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cW-what? No!\u201d She looked at Izuku, pleading with him. \u201cIzuku, p-please! Please don\u2019t let them do this to me!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Izuku looked lost, obviously not knowing what to do. Katsuki was still struggling against Eraserhead\u2019s bindings, so he wasn\u2019t going to be any help. Mitsuki stood up, not even hesitating to let her hand crack across Inko\u2019s face. She heard a few of the room\u2019s occupants gasping, although with her track record, they really shouldn\u2019t have been surprised.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re \n\ndead\n\n to us,\u201d Mitsuki told Inko. They had been best friends since their freshman year of college, when they had first been roommates. That was twenty-four years of friendship flushed down the drain.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mitsuki rounded the table and collapsed in the chair next to Izuku\u2019s, pulling the boy into her arms. Izuku melted, pushing his face into her collarbone, his entire body beginning to tremble as he cried into her. He had grown so much over the years, and even though she saw him all the time these days, it still shocked Mitsuki when she felt his corded muscles wrap around her as well, squeezing her tightly to himself like she was his anchor. She let it happen, ignoring the uncomfortable twinge in her back as she ran her fingers through Izuku\u2019s unruly curls. Present Mic and Midnight led a wailing Inko out of the room, and soon enough, Eraserhead let Katsuki go. Masaru was at their son\u2019s side immediately, wrapping him into a hug of his own. Katuki had always been more receptive to Masaru\u2019s hugs than Mitsuki\u2019s, which probably had to do with their clashing domineering personalities, but at the moment, she could only be grateful, since it meant she was free to watch over Katsuki and comfort Izuku at the same time.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe will take care of Midoriya-san, so there is no need to worry about that for now,\u201d Principal Nedzu said after some time. Mitsuki had almost forgotten he was there, although he, Recovery Girl and Eraserhead were still in the room. \u201cWe will leave the four of you alone now. Katsuki and Izuku have the entire week off of school, so if they would like to spend that break in the dorms or at the Bakugou household, they are more than welcome to do so. Just let us know.\u201d The three other adults all bowed to them, and Mitsuki nodded thankfully to them in return. If she had anything to say about it, then her boys would be spending the week with her and Masaru.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They say that time heals all wounds.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Katsuki says that\u2019s a load of bullshit. How can time heal the wounds if everyone around you reminds you of them every goddamn second? With every pitying look his classmates gave him, every worried text his parents sent, Katsuki\u2019s anger rose to a dangerous degree. The only thing keeping him sane was Deku, of all people.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He knew exactly what Katsuki was going through, and seemed to even share his sentiment. He wasn\u2019t annoyed by his parents\u2019 incessant texts; Katsuki was slowly beginning to realize that Deku had probably never been shown the kindness and love of a true parent- but he did seem rather annoyed at Class 2-A\u2019s handling of them with kid gloves. As if they hadn\u2019t already spent thirteen \n\nyears\n\n of experience dealing with what had happened to them. To Katsuki\u2019s utter shock, it was \n\nDeku\n\n who snapped during class training.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was all set to spar with Round Face, with the rest of the class standing to watch their techniques to give critiques when they were done. Katsuki knew that Deku hadn\u2019t gotten a lot of sleep the night before, if the circles under his eyes were any indication. He also knew that Deku didn\u2019t like to be coddled, as he\u2019d spent the first fifteen years of his life being treated like he was glass for being quirkless.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDeku-kun,\u201d Uraraka said gently right before Aizawa-sensei was about to signal that they could begin. \u201cAre you sure that you want to do this? You seem a little tired\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Katsuki could see the exact moment that all of Deku\u2019s restraint left him. His shoulders bunched up around his ears, his face beginning to turn pink from the strain of his anger. Katsuki felt his own body tense up, knowing that an angry Deku was \n\nnever\n\n a good thing. The last time Katsuki had seen a freakout like this, Deku had been quirkless. He loathed to think about the kind of damage that Deku could do with One for All.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStop treating me like I\u2019m a \n\nkid\n\n!\u201d Deku lunged for his best friend without waiting for Aizawa\u2019s signal. Uraraka\u2019s eyes widened comically before she dodged to the side, waving her hands frantically.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDeku, stop! You shouldn\u2019t be-\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s screwed,\u201d Katsuki muttered to himself, gaining strange looks from the extras around him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Deku lurched forward again, a snarl on his face as the green lightning of his quirk activated around his limbs. Uraraka yelped and then suddenly, they were sparring. However, instead of Izuku holding back the way he usually would during class, he was going all out against his friend, using not only the brute strength of One for All, but also Black Whip and Float. He\u2019d only ever gone this hard during training with \n\nKatsuki\n\n, and although he would never admit it, Katsuki knew how hard it was to beat Deku when he went all out. Uraraka didn\u2019t have a chance in hell.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aizawa didn\u2019t seem to share this sentiment however, as he was studying Deku kicking Uraraka\u2019s ass with interest. Katsuki could feel the rest of the class fidgeting and ansty, no doubt in shock over how much power Deku was using and how furious he was. Deku didn\u2019t often get angry, case in point that he\u2019d been fourteen the last time Katsuki had seen it. Clearly, they were terrified of angering him even more.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018\n\nShit, I\u2019m going to have to be the one to stop this,\u2019\n\n Katsuki thought, groaning to himself. He stepped forwards, letting his palms spark before he used his explosions to launch himself directly in between Deku and Round Face, who was bruised, bloody and panting from the effort of trying to fight off Deku. She may have been absurdly powerful, just like the rest of Class 2-A but there were very few people who could manage to beat the top four students in class- Bakugou, Deku, Ponytail and IcyHot. The four of them tended to spar against each other for the more intense classes.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDeku! Back the fuck off, would you?\u201d Katsuki yelled, holding out his palms in warning in Deku\u2019s direction. Behind his back, Uraraka was beginning to whimper like she was on the verge of bursting into tears.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m \n\nsick\n\n of being treated like a fucking \n\nbaby\n\n,\u201d Deku snarled ferally. Cuss words \n\nnever\n\n sounded right coming out of Izuku\u2019s mouth, and this time was no exception. He was acting like \n\nBakugou\n\n. It was very strange to see.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI know, I am too,\u201d Katsuki said. \u201cBut Round Face is your best friend. She\u2019s just looking out for you. If you keep beating her up, then you\u2019re no better than \n\nhim\n\n.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That seemed to finally break Izuku out of it. His eyes slowly began to clear, the black, shadowy whips and green lightening of his quirk fading away into nothingness. By the time he had calmed all the way down, he looked so exhausted that he collapsed onto his knees. Katsuki went forward and tried to catch the boy, lowering him gently onto the ground.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just so tired,\u201d Izuku muttered into Katsuki\u2019s chest. \u201cI wish none of this had ever happened.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Katsuki debated his answer for a moment. Instinctually, he wanted to say that he agreed. If none of this had ever happened, everything would be normal and no one in the class would be treating them differently. He\u2019d be able to yell at them without getting pitying looks, would be able to spar with them without having them \n\nhold back \n\non him. And yet\u2026\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he told Deku. The boy looked surprised, looking up into Katsuki\u2019s crimson eyes like he was searching for an answer there. \u201cIf none of this had ever happened, you would still be under Aun- under your mom\u2019s clutches. We never would have found out what she allowed because of her cowardice and greed. That\u2019s just unacceptable.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat she allowed?\u201d Uraraka spoke up, sniffling a bit and wiping her eyes. \u201cDeku-kun\u2026 did your mom \n\nlet\n\n your dad do that to you?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deku looked up at her, before sweeping his eyes over the rest of their waiting classmates. \u201cYes, she did.\u201d Aizawa bowed his head with his eyes closed, no doubt remembering the day that Inko had been arrested. Katsuki remembered that day every night in his dreams, sometimes bordering on nightmares. \u201cBut you all need to understand something.\u201d He used Katsuki\u2019s body as leverage to stand, his legs only trembling a little bit from the strain. \u201cJust because you have all only recently found out about what happened to me and Kacchan doesn\u2019t mean that you can treat us differently. Don\u2019t forget that we\u2019ve been dealing with it for thirteen years. Literally nothing has changed between this week and last week, before you knew, because it \n\nalready happened\n\n. There\u2019s nothing any of you can do or say to make that disappear. You need to stop treating us like we\u2019re going to break, because we\u2019ve \n\nalways\n\n been this way. All you\u2019re doing is making us want to push you away more.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re sorry,\u201d Kirishima said gently. \u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to make you feel anything bad. We just\u2026 we didn\u2019t know how you would react to us knowing now. We were trying to be considerate.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSince when does Kacchan like consideration,\u201d Deku joked. Just like that, the tension broke. Almost the entire class was grinning now, and Kaminari even had the audacity to come over to Katsuki to sling an arm around his shoulder. Sero wasn\u2019t far behind, slinging an arm around the opposite shoulder.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe sure do love our blasty,\u201d Kaminari joked. Katsuki\u2019s irritation spiked, although it was overwhelmed almost immediately by begrudging affection for his dumbass friends. Not that he would \n\never\n\n let them know he cared about them.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGet the fuck off of me, you goddamn extras,\u201d he yelled, shoving them away from him. Turning to Aizawa, he growled. \u201cCan we get back to the fucking class already?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d Aizawa said, narrowing his eyes. \u201cJirou and Hagakure, you two are next. While you spar, I\u2019m going to need Midoriya to come with me.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMe?\u201d Midoriya squeaked.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou,\u201d Aizawa confirmed. He beckoned Midoriya to follow him before turning around, calling to Iida over his shoulder. \u201cIida, you\u2019re in charge!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deku exchanged a worried look with Kacchan, but still followed Aizawa out of the room. Katsuki turned away from the two\u2019s retreating backs, pretending that anxiety wasn\u2019t pooling in the pit of his stomach.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n(x)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Izuku twisted his crooked fingers together as Aizawa-sensei led them to his office, gesturing for Izuku to sit down on one of the couches. The man took the seat opposite the coffee table from him, leaning his elbows on his thighs so he could lean towards Izuku. For a few moments they only stared at each other, Midoriya\u2019s nervousness increasing with every passing second. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Aizawa spoke.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been holding back in class.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0It wasn\u2019t a question, but Izuku answered it like one anyway. \u201c...Yes. I didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou are supposed to let \n\nme\n\n handle decisions like that,\u201d Eraserhead scowled. \u201cYou\u2019re selling your classmates too short. If I didn\u2019t know better than that, I would think you were being arrogant.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI- I\u2019m not!\u201d Deku waved his hands in the air. \u201cOf course that\u2019s not- well, today kind of proved me right, didn\u2019t it? I hurt Uraraka by going all-out.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Aizawa quirked an eyebrow at Izuku. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s true, but I stand by my previous statement. You\u2019re supposed to leave those decisions to me.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo\u2026 you \n\nwant \n\nme to hurt my classmates?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf course not.\u201d Aizawa let his eyes slip closed, like he was praying to the gods for strength to deal with Izuku. \u201cI \n\nwant\n\n you to respect them enough to try your best.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Izuku ducked his head with a nod. \u201cYes, sensei.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGood.\u201d Aizawa leaned back in his chair. \u201cNow that that\u2019s out of the way. How have you been doing, Problem Child? You\u2019ve been separated from your mother within the past week, and it\u2019s likely that she will go to jail facing child pornography distribution charges that will put her in jail for a long, \n\nlong\n\n time.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Izuku winced, looking down at his lap. \u201c...I know. I did some research.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aizawa nodded. \u201cWould you be willing to testify against her?\u201d Izuku looked up sharply, but Aizawa wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cBakugou Mitsuki and Bakugou Masaru have already agreed to testify what they have known to be true. Is it true that your mother was pretty overprotective?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Midoriya glanced around surreptitiously. \u201cAre there detectives hiding in here or something?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis is off the record,\u201d Aizawa coaxed. \u201cI\u2019m a licensed psychologist, and although this isn\u2019t a professional setting, I really do just have your best interests in mind.\u201d The man took a deep breath before gritting out, \u201cI\u2026 \n\ncare\n\n about you.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Izuku\u2019s heart squeezed at the declaration. \u201cWow. Did that crush your soul a little bit, Eraserhead-sensei?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cJust answer the questions and I\u2019ll let you go back to class,\u201d the man scolded. Izuku\u2019s humor felt as he remembered the way his mother used to treat him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d he finally said. \u201cShe was pretty overprotective. When I was younger, I wasn\u2019t allowed to leave the house unless it was for school or to go over to Kacchan\u2019s house. Auntie and Uncle thought it was strange, so they often let me and Kacchan go to the park when they told my mom that we were still at home. She finally let me leave the house alone when I was around eleven-\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cEleven?\u201d Aizawa sounded shocked. \u201cShe forced you to stay inside for that long?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell I mean, I was allowed to go to school,\u201d he said, like that was any better. \u201cBut yeah. It was\u2026 pretty bad. When I got to middle school it was better, and I started taking longer ways home so I could stay out longer, and then I started studying villain attacks instead of just focusing on online videos\u2026 I didn\u2019t have any friends, so after Kacchan and I stopped hanging out, I didn\u2019t get out much.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou didn\u2019t have \n\nany\n\n friends? Surely that\u2019s an exaggeration.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u2018\n\nGods, this is so embarrassing,\u2019\n\n Izuku thought to himself. \u201cNo. Uraraka-chan was my first friend since Kacchan and I stopped playing together when we were seven.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Aizawa looked absolutely \n\nfloored\n\n. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit hard to believe. You seem to make friends with anyone you so much as breathe at these days.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Izuku brightened. \u201cI know! Isn\u2019t it amazing? I\u2019m so lucky so many people think I\u2019m good enough to be their friend!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Izuku could practically see something crossover Aizawa\u2019s face; some sort of look of understanding, like he had finally put together the last piece of a puzzle he\u2019d been working on for years.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMidoriya,\u201d he said calculatingly. \u201cI think the way that your mother has treated you all of these years has caused you to develop serious self-esteem issues. What with your self-sacrificial streak a mile long, and the way you don\u2019t seem to care about yourself at all, it makes sense. Tell me, did your mother ever implant any ideas about your worth into you?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Izuku thought about it for a moment, a lot of things about his life beginning to make sense as it all sank in. \u201cI mean\u2026 I developed my quirk really, really late, at the entrance exam. Before that, everyone thought I was quirkless. She just\u2026 she worried about her quirkless son, that\u2019s all. She warded me off of dangerous things and dangerous professions because she was worried for my safety.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo she treated you similarly to how your peers have been treating you recently,\u201d Aizawa asked.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d Izuku whispered. \u201cOh god, that\u2019s why I freaked out\u2026 because they reminded me of my mother?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Aizawa said honestly. \u201cBut I do know that you deserve better than that, Midoriya. I hope you trust me enough to let me help you.\u201d The man extended one of his hands towards Izuku, waiting for him to shake it. Izuku eyed the hand, his mind a whirlwind of different events of his life. His mother never believing in him, Katsuki bullying him and pushing him away because of what Izuku\u2019s father had done to them. Katsuki\u2019s various breakdowns over the years that he only let Izuku see, because only Izuku could truly understand what was wrong. All of his classmates caring so much for him, his teachers\u2019 concern over what he and Katsuki had gone through\u2026 the Bakugou matriarch and patriarch welcoming Izuku into their arms like he was their own son.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0It occurred to Izuku that, no matter what he and Kacchan kept bolstering about, the two of them really \n\nweren\u2019t\n\n okay. It may have been thirteen years since Hisashi had been around, but that didn\u2019t mean that they had been dealing with the aftermath of what he\u2019d done. In fact, they\u2019d done pretty much the opposite; pushing everything and everyone away, just trying to forget rather than deal with it themselves. Izuku \n\nwanted\n\n to heal. He wanted to be able to look back at days like today and realize that he was better.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So he reached forward and took Aizawa\u2019s hand.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FIN \n"
