    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n[moodboard by the birthday girl]\n\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nThe absolute chaos of watching dozens of kids kick off their street shoes to put on slippers for the school day was not lost on Park Jimin, even after years of daily repetition.\n\u201cQuickly, quickly,\u201d he encouraged, watching his class of first grade students bustle around as the clock ticked closer to half past eight in the morning. Winter coats, scarves, face masks, nice shoes\u2014dozens of young kids shoved their shoe bags into their designated shoe storage box and stored their other belongings, the chatter happy and excited. Slippers went on, and Jimin greeted each of his twenty-two students as they entered his classroom for the school day, smiling and watching friend groups converge together.\u00a0\n\u201cGood morning, good morning, good morning,\u201d Jimin said as he walked through the classroom, every student seated exactly where they should be, every student wearing their school uniform. Jangseong Elementary School was one of the best in Seoul, and Jimin had been a first grade teacher at the school for five years now. That meant that he was going to be switching to a new elementary school soon, since teachers and principals rotated on a five-year schedule. But his time at Jangseong had been phenomenal thus far, and he was certain that this year\u2019s class (though the year was coming to a close already) was one of his best.\n\u201cHas everyone brought me their homework?\u201d Jimin asked with a small smile.\n\u201cYE-E-E-ES.\u201d\n\u201cDid you all sleep well last night?\u201d\n\u201cYE-E-E-ES.\u201d\n\u201cAre you feeling warm, or do we need to fix that?\u201d\n\u201cYE-E-E-ES!\u201d the students all called out, a few of them giggling. Jimin heaved a dramatic sigh on purpose, the giggling escalating, and then he clapped his hands once and lifted his hands palms-up. His students all shoved their chairs back and stood up in excited anticipation.\n\u201cI hope your counting skills are perfect,\u201d he warned, and he heard one boy hurriedly counting to eight under his breath. \u201cEight! Four! Two! One! Are you ready?\u201d\n\u201cYE-E-E-ES!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, here we go. A-five, a-six, a-five, six, seven, eight,\u201d Jimin counted in jokingly, the giggles reaching a peak as he clapped his hands. Then, together, the entire class began to shake and wiggle around. Eight shakes of the right arm, then the left, then the right leg, then the left leg. Then four of each. Then two. Then one. All the while, they counted out loud, and the train derailed somewhere around four shakes on the right leg. The laughter was infectious, and even Jimin was laughing, but they made it through, and he motioned for his students to sit down.\n\u201cOkay, nap time,\u201d he said, and immediately, about seven or eight students threw their heads onto their desks and pretended to sleep and snore. Jimin smiled, and then he clapped his hands! \u201cAlright! Please pull out your textbooks for  We are the First Graders! Quickly!\u201d\nThere was a quiet but mad scramble as twenty-two small but growing humans dug into their desks to pull out their textbooks, whispering to each other. Jimin watched, using a thumb to fan through the pages of his copy of the textbook repeatedly as he cradled it in one arm. He was familiar with this curriculum. He could probably teach it in his sleep at this point.\nTeaching wasn\u2019t something that was in Jimin\u2019s blood. So many of his colleagues boasted a mother who taught kindergarten or a father who taught high school literature, but Jimin\u2019s father was a staunch businessman, and his mother was a legal secretary. Both of them had warned Jimin that despite the unmatched level of respect, he would burn out being a teacher within a year, that it wasn\u2019t the job for him, that he should focus more on becoming a businessman like his father and just make a decent living. But Jimin had stumbled into teaching after being inspired by one of his high school teachers, and he had never once looked back or regretted his choice.\nThere was something intriguing to Jimin about little kids, especially the age that he taught. Teaching high school had been a big turn-off, mostly because of the stress that the students were put under to perform and succeed. In first grade, Jimin could focus on developing their personalities and shaping their behavior into something lovely. He also found that parents were far more curious and simultaneously out-of-the-loop, albeit eccentric, when it came to first graders. It was always a grab-bag, and it made for interesting work.\u00a0\nThe school day always flew by quickly, mostly because Jimin never let a dull moment consume the classroom. He moved seamlessly from the first grade-specific curriculum right into Korean, focusing mostly on writing today. When his class departed for lunchtime in the cafeteria, Jimin followed, always keeping an eye out for his closest friend at Jangseong, Kim Seokjin. Seokjin was a few years older and taught third grade, which suited his witty personality best.\n\u201cI\u2019m about to lose my mind.\u201d\n\u201cDo tell,\u201d Jimin said, falling right into step beside Seokjin and watching his small first graders beside the growing third graders.\n\u201cHow hard do you think it is to stand and recite your twelves times tables on command?\u201d Seokjin asked rhetorically, and Jimin snickered prematurely. \u201cAnd in what world is \u2018my dog wouldn\u2019t pee in the snow this morning\u2019 a good excuse for forgetting them?\u201d\n\u201cValid, in my opinion. It\u2019s the end of January. It\u2019s snowing. Even  I  don\u2019t want to get out of bed to pee in the morning,\u201d Jimin pointed out, and Seokjin gave him a look. Nobody exchanged banter with Jimin about the woes of being a teacher like Seokjin did. So many teachers at Jangseong were so  serious, veterans in the field, or brand new and too focused on succeeding. Jimin was in his eighth year of teaching, and he was somewhere in limbo. Seokjin was a ten-year veteran, but his sense of humor was still intact.\n\u201cI have so many jokes about peeing first thing in the morning in winter,\u201d Seokjin sighed, sounding disappointed in his current environment that wasn\u2019t conducive for adult jokes. \u201cI\u2019ll save them for staff meetings.\u201d\n\u201cThe only person who would listen to those jokes is Jeongyeon.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019d love them.\u201d\nThen they both stood quietly side-by-side, watching their students carry trays to the lunch tables, sitting with friends. Jimin briefly watched the flurry of chopsticks and the slurping of soup amongst all the students, and then Seokjin snickered in fond amusement.\n\u201cNew tattoos?\u201d he asked, and Jimin whipped his head over, knowing exactly which student Seokjin was referencing. He squinted to find her, and then he blew out a breath, lips vibrating.\n\u201cShe always does it in the lunch line,\u201d he sighed. \u201cThis girl steals markers like a seasoned thief.\u201d\n\u201cIs it a form of self-expression, or is she convinced that her skin is paper?\u201d Seokjin asked, trying not to laugh.\n\u201cShe has to know someone with tattoos,\u201d Jimin deduced. \u201cThere\u2019s no way she\u2019s just doing that for the hell of it. It\u2019s been an entire school year, and she\u2019s still doing it, even though I scold her every single time. She doesn\u2019t even care.\u201d\n\u201cIf she wasn\u2019t a little genius, it would be a problem,\u201d Seokjin pointed out. \u201cBut if she\u2019s not in my class in two years, I\u2019ll switch schools.\u201d\nJimin snickered, and then Seokjin leaned back like he was being launched before taking a giant step forward to swiftly walk over to one of his students who had beckoned to him. Jimin turned his attention then to Jeon Dasom, the seven-year-old who had weasled her way right into Jimin\u2019s heart from day one, burrowing and making a home there. Dasom was whimsically intelligent and stoic in the face of school-based discipline, always questioning  why. She and Jimin had a special little secret between the two of them, mostly because Dasom had dealt with some bullying at the beginning of the semester.\nMost kids were oblivious, but there were a select elite group of students who were consistently cruel. Jangseong Elementary was full of students with wealthy or affluent parents, and those students mixed in with the working-class families. It was back in October when Dasom had come to Jimin crying, because older students (with parental clout to back them up) were making fun of her father. When Jimin had pressed her for a reason, she had vehemently refused to talk about it at first. But Jimin, privy to her habits, had handed her some markers, allowing her to draw on her own skin while talking. Dasom had then indignantly said, while drawing, that they were hounding her because they heard that her father liked women  and men. When Jimin had quietly asked Dasom if it was true, Dasom had scoffed.\n\u201cWell, my dad is bisexual.\u201d\nHearing it come from a seven-year-old\u2019s mouth had been startling, but Jimin had calmed Dasom down significantly by assuring her that it was okay, and that he, too, liked men. Dasom had been fascinated, promising not to tell other kids, and she and Jimin had formed a special little bond.\nMost kids were relatively tight-lipped about their parents, and Dasom was no exception. She did, however, always have a wicked gleam in her eyes when she talked about her father, minus the bullying incident, and she rarely mentioned a mother. Jimin knew he wasn\u2019t supposed to have favorites, but every year, he always had one or two students that he liked best. This year, it was Jeon Dasom.\nAfter lunch, Jimin gathered his class back into his classroom for mathematics, already dreading the lesson he had prepared. His students worked well individually, but when they did group work, there were always little problems. The kids tried hard not to butt heads, but Jimin had a few mean girls in his class this year with parents who made nice donations to the school, so it was a delicate balance. Most kids wanted to do well and present themselves as angels so that their parents would be proud, but a handful liked to make Jimin\u2019s job difficult.\n\u201cSo with the worksheet\u2014\u201d Jimin held it up as one of his students passed out one to each classmate\u2014 \u201cI want you to use what you\u2019ve learned from the number chart. Focus on the number chart with your group, and don\u2019t forget everything we\u2019ve learned about place value! I\u2019m paying  very close attention to that. It\u2019s the end of the semester, don\u2019t forget! Now\u2014let\u2019s split into groups.\u201d\nJimin shook the can of popsicle sticks with numbers on them, and then he walked around and let each student pick. He had done it dozens of times before, so with their popsicle stick, each student knew where to go. Five groups came together, and Jimin watched as, in a team effort, each group gathered what they would need to make their number chart to present to the class. Jimin stood quietly and observed, making sure that no one was carrying scissors dangerously or putting the glue stick too close to their mouth.\n\u201cPark  seonsaengnim?\u201d \n\u201cYes? What is it?\u201d Jimin tore his eyes away from group three.\n\u201cDo we do the worksheet problems together in our group?\u201d Jeon Dasom blinked up at Jimin with a pencil in one hand, her other hand on her hip. She was wearing her school uniform like every other kid\u2014navy blue pants, a white button-up shirt, and a navy blue tie. But her shirt was coming untucked, her tie was skewed, and her arms were still covered in different colors from markers. Jimin wordlessly reached into his desk drawer, grabbed a wet wipe, and took Dasom\u2019s hand to extend her arm out straight. He then wiped her arm as he replied.\n\u201cYes, you do the worksheet with your group  after you make the chart,\u201d he said, and Dasom just watched all her little drawings disappear without complaint.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Dasom flicked one braid over her shoulder, and Jimin smiled. Dasom was exceedingly cute, almost like a doll\u2014round and angelic face, bright brown doe eyes, one dimple in her cheek when she smiled, long black hair that was always in some cool hairstyle. Today, it was in two Dutch braids, the tips resting over her shoulders. Back in December, she had come in with tinsel braided in her hair, and all of the girls had been jealous. Last week, her ponytail had been split into a dozen braids, and one girl had cried because  she wanted a cool hairstyle, too.\n\u201cAny other questions?\u201d Jimin asked, amused. Dasom shook her head, braids flopping, and then she bowed her head and turned to skip off to her group, completely unfazed by her teacher wiping down her arms as he did almost every single day.\nJimin knew a lot of teachers who focused on their own work while their class did group work, but Jimin had very little attention span to do any grading or answer emails. Interested in what his class was doing, Jimin slowly circled around the room, crouching down with each group and asking questions curiously. He volunteered to cut out a 2-D tens block for Haeun from group four, and he sat cross-legged and helped group one with the first two questions on their worksheet. Jimin had learned quickly as a teacher that if he was apathetic or detached, if he was uninvolved, then his students learned only what the curriculum offered. He wasn\u2019t their father and he wasn\u2019t their friend, but he wanted them to feel like their teacher cared or held interest in them.\n\u201cAh-h-h, so how much does that make?\u201d Jimin asked, watching with a smile as two boys in group two quietly counted the paper blocks they had been cutting for one side of their number chart. \u201cCan you group the ones together?\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Doyoung said, hopping up onto his knees. \u201cOkay, so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAH-H-H-H-H! GET OFF ME!\u201d\nIn a flash, pandemonium broke out by the classroom door where group three was working. Jimin jumped to his feet nimbly, brow furrowed, and then he vaulted over Doyoung and shoved one desk chair aside, skipping over art supplies and leaping over to the door, trying to figure out what the hell was going on.\n\u201cSTOP IT! STOP IT!\u201d\n\u201cOkay,  off, off.\u201d Jimin slipped his hands underneath Dasom\u2019s arms and lifted her off poor Hwang Hayoon, who was screeching and swatting at Dasom. Jimin tugged and then set Dasom firmly on her feet again, and Dasom didn\u2019t even avert her eyes or cower in a manner of premeditated groveling. She just set her hands on her hips and raised her eyebrows, head tilted to the side a bit as she stared. Hayoon\u2019s two pigtails were now a skewed mess, because Dasom had been holding one in each hand while sitting on top of Hayoon and demanding heaven-knew-what.\n\u201cI hate her!\u201d Hayoon whined, scrambling to her feet with tears in her eyes.\n\u201cStop making fun of Jiwon,\u201d Dasom said calmly. Poor Kim Jiwon, blinking with owlish eyes behind her glasses, seemed stunned.\n\u201cShe slapped me!\u201d Hayoon accused, pointing a small finger at Dasom. Dasom didn\u2019t even deny it.\n\u201c Stop  making  fun  of  Jiwon,\u201d Dasom repeated, crossing her arms. Jimin blew out a breath, still kneeling so he could be eye-level with both girls, but he stood up decisively.\n\u201cDasom-ah,\u201d he sighed. \u201cGo sit down at your desk. I\u2019ll need to call your parents.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Dasom huffed. \u201cBut tell her to stop making fun of Jiwon.\u201d\n\u201cGo,\u201d Jimin demanded, pointing. Dasom scowled, but then she marched back to her desk, ignoring the other groups that were slowly getting back to work after witnessing the tussle. Jimin turned to Hayoon.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked tiredly.\n\u201cDasom is crazy,\u201d Hayoon whined, pouting something fierce as she tightly crossed her arms. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in her group anymore.\u201d\n Keep your head on straight. She\u2019s the child of a rich man who could get you fired in a heartbeat. Jimin took a deep breath.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m lucky I didn\u2019t  die,\u201d  Hayoon said dramatically, and Jimin raised his eyebrows, making eye contact. Hayoon was smart enough to respect her teacher, so she cowered just a little. \u201cI\u2019m not  hurt, but it hurt when she pulled my hair.\u201d\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s just fix that up,\u201d Jimin said, breathing deeply to keep himself from scolding Hayoon for being a bully. Instead, he smoothed out her hair and tightened the pigtails with care, and then he gestured. \u201cIf you\u2019re not hurt, then please get back to work,\u201d he quietly requested. Hayoon scowled just like Dasom had, but she pivoted on her heels and went back to her group, plopping down cross-legged. Jimin watched her for a moment, and then he clicked his tongue. It had taken all of ten seconds for Hayoon to tighten her pigtails by herself and giggle with her best friend and snatch the scissors from Jiwon\u2019s hands, turning a shoulder away from Jiwon.\n Shit, now I have to take her to the principal because it turned into a physical fight,  Jimin silently bemoaned, watching as Dasom laid her head down on her desk and grabbed a marker, using her teeth to pop off the cap and then pressing the ink tip to her arm to draw. Dasom was easily one of the smartest students in his class, but sometimes she just  did things that made Jimin wonder what in the hell her home life was like. Not in a negative way, either\u2014in a curious way. She was articulate, outspoken, sweet, fiery, funny, and easily distracted by things like a tiny bug on the windowsill. She accepted discipline but picked and chose what suited her. Hayoon rejected all discipline. Jiwon was a typical submissive first grader. Dasom was\u2026 something else entirely.\n\u201cDasom-ah.\u201d\n\u201cIs my dad going to come here?\u201d she quietly asked, still drawing as Jimin crouched down to speak with her, his eyes still wandering the room to supervise his class.\n\u201cYes. We\u2019ll need to speak to the principal,\u201d Jimin relayed, bracing for impact. Most kids tended to tear up and wail out an apology to avoid discipline. Dasom just popped her lips a few times, still drawing.\n\u201cPark  seonsaengnim,\u201d she said, and Jimin quietly listened. \u201cHayoon is mean. She\u2019s mean all the time. She\u2019s never nice.\u201d\n\u201cI hear you.\u201d Jimin rested his chin on Dasom\u2019s desk and blinked at her, and she finally looked up and stared at him. \u201cBut you still have to go to the principal. And you have to apologize to Hayoon.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sorry for slapping her.\u201d\n\u201cPretend you are,\u201d Jimin whispered, and Dasom cracked a smile and set down the marker. Jimin stood up, called out for the class to keep working and took in their choral response to him, and then guided Dasom over to her former group. He set a hand on her shoulder.\n\u201cHayoon-ah.\u201d\n\u201cYes? Oh.\u201d Hayoon smiled, and then she hopped to her feet and folded her hands behind her back, swaying back and forth a few times as she waited for the apology she knew was coming. Dasom slowly turned and looked up at Jimin, and Jimin almost lost his composure. The look on her face was priceless, something akin to, \u201care you really going to make me do this?\u201d But Jimin held it together long enough to beckon, so Dasom sighed.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for tackling you and slapping you and pulling your hair,\u201d she listed. \u201cBut be nice to Jiwon.\u201d\n\u201cDasom-ah.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dasom said in exasperation, bowing her head to Hayoon. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m sorry, Hayoon-ah.\u201d\nHayoon hummed with a pleased smile at Jimin\u2019s direction, and Jimin nodded.\n\u201cGet back to work,\u201d he instructed, so Hayoon plopped down cross-legged and barked out an order to one of the girls, pigtails swinging as she reached for the glue. Dasom went back to her seat and dropped into her chair, and Jimin sighed, grabbing the worksheet for her to do instead of the group work just to keep her out of trouble, or to keep more trouble from brewing. Then he surveyed his entire class as they worked diligently, reaching for the phone on his desk at the same time to arrange the meeting.\nThe meeting was to take place after school, and Mr. Song, the principal, called Jimin an hour after the incident to say that Dasom\u2019s father would be coming to the meeting. Jimin hoped and prayed that the rest of the day would go smoothly, and to his relief, it did. There were no further altercations, and dismissal was a breeze. His class all departed for the day after cleaning the classroom, but Dasom stayed behind.\n\u201cOkay, come with me,\u201d Jimin said when the classroom was empty and clean. Dasom had her backpack on already, and she quietly walked by Jimin\u2019s side down the hall and around the corner to the principal\u2019s office, not a single hint of fear in her step or in her eyes. Jimin knocked on the door, waited until he heard a voice telling him to enter, and then opened the door. He guided Dasom in first, and then he gestured for her to sit down in one of the two chairs across from Mr. Song\u2019s desk.\n\u201cSay hello,\u201d Jimin whispered, scooting off to the side to find a good place to stand by and observe. Mr. Song, a middle-aged man with salt-and-pepper hair, glasses, and a sharp jawline with dark eyes, watched Dasom carefully, adjusting his tie as he did.\n\u201cHello,  gyojang seonsaengnim,\u201d Dasom said with a bow, and then she sat back down. Mr. Song arched one eyebrow, his hands folded on his desktop.\n\u201cYour father is on his way here,\u201d Mr. Song said in his deep voice that Jimin felt in his soul, but Dasom didn\u2019t curl in on herself in shame. Instead, she seemed to perk up a bit, eyes flicking to the door in premature eagerness. \u201cWe will discuss this matter and then decide the proper course of action when he arrives.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Dasom said, swinging her little legs back and forth with her elbows resting on the armrests. Jimin watched her in interest, because she was far too level-headed for a seven-year-old who was about to get an earful from her  father, of all people, about smacking classmates. Jimin had taken children to the principal before, and every single one of them had cried or held Jimin\u2019s arm or gripped the chair for dear life, terrified of their mother or father\u2019s reaction, scared of the disappointment and subsequent punishment. But Dasom was just looking around the office with curious doe eyes, and her father was five minutes late.\nA knock on the door disrupted the awkward silence, and Jimin glanced up. The door swung open.\n\u201cSorry I\u2019m late. Traffic.\u201d\nMr. Song stood up to greet Dasom\u2019s father, and Dasom hopped up and knelt in her chair with a smile, but Jimin just stood up and stared.\u00a0\n\n Oh, Jesus Christ. \n\nThe man who walked into the room looked like he had spent a lot of time in the principal\u2019s office himself in his earlier years. His black hair was cut short and parted to the side, sunglasses pushed up into it in his haste to enter the building and find his daughter. He was wearing black pants and a short-sleeved white button-up with half the buttons undone, but his outfit in the face of the bitter January cold was hardly reason for Jimin to stare. Dasom\u2019s father had two full sleeves of tattoos on his toned arms and an eyebrow piercing, and he was twirling his car keys around one finger distractedly.\n\u201cHi. Don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met.\u201d He stopped and bowed breathlessly to the principal, and then he politely offered his hand. \u201cJeon Jeongguk.\u201d He shook Mr. Song\u2019s hand firmly, and then he pivoted and faced Jimin, bowing. \u201cJeon Jeongguk. Nice to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cPark Jimin. Dasom\u2019s classroom teacher,\u201d Jimin introduced himself.\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Jeon Jeongguk said with a one-dimpled grin, tossing his car keys up and catching them with one hand in a snatching motion before tucking them into his pocket. Suddenly, everything about Dasom\u2019s appearance and mannerisms made sense\u2014the one dimple, her Bambi eyes, the way she constantly drew on her arms with markers.\u00a0\nJimin watched quietly as Jeongguk glanced around, found the empty chair beside Dasom, and plopped down into it, crossing his leg with his left ankle on his right knee. He rolled his head to the left, where Dasom was kneeling and staring at him.\n\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d he asked her in mild exasperation, and Jimin almost laughed. Mr. Song cleared his throat, so Jeongguk looked to the principal with a quick bow of his head, listening.\n\u201cJeongguk-ssi, your daughter got into an altercation with another student in her class,\u201d Mr. Song detailed, and Jeongguk nodded. \u201cA  physical  altercation, mind you. I\u2019ll allow her teacher to explain what happened.\u201d He then gestured to Jimin, and Jimin took a deep breath.  Be professional. Keep it together. It\u2019s just your student\u2019s really hot father. No big deal. \n\u201cRight. Well, they were doing group work for mathematics, creating a number chart,\u201d he explained. \u201cDasom was in a group with four other girls. And at one point, when I looked over, she, uh\u2026 she was in a physical fight with Hayoon. So I pulled her off Hayoon and separated her from the group. Dasom said that Hayoon was making fun of another girl in their group.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Jeongguk pinched his bottom lip between his thumb and pointer finger, and then he nodded once firmly. Jimin then watched as Jeongguk grabbed the arms of his chair, stood up halfway, shuffled until his chair was facing Dasom, and then he set it back down. In one swift motion, he shoved the armrest of Dasom\u2019s chair so that she was facing him, and Jimin held his breath.  Here it comes. \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jeongguk rested his elbows on his knees with his hands folded, and Jimin\u2019s jaw dropped.\n\u201cJeongguk-ssi, it\u2019s very important that we\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMay I just have a moment to hear the story from her?\u201d Jeongguk requested, interrupting the principal politely. Mr. Song snapped his mouth shut, startled, and Jimin almost laughed. Never once, in his eight years of teaching, had he seen a parent do anything except bow to the principal and apologize and scold their child. \u201cDasom-ah. What happened?\u201d\n\u201cHayoon always makes fun of Jiwon because Jiwon has a lisp,\u201d Dasom articulated clearly, and then she pulled her legs up and crossed them in the chair as if she wasn\u2019t in the principal\u2019s office for smacking a girl clear across the face. \u201cAnd we were doing numbers one to ten on the chart.\u201d\n\u201cSo what, Hayoon was teasing Jiwon every time she said \u2018three\u2019 or something?\u201d Jeongguk asked, and Dasom nodded fervently.\n\u201cYeah, and she does it all the time, Dad. She\u2019s really mean. She made her friend tease Jiwon, too. So I told her to stop, and she didn\u2019t stop. She teased  me and said I was a loser for being friends with Jiwon.\u201d\n\u201cSo what\u2019d you do?\u201d\n\u201cI tackled her.\u201d\nJeongguk immediately snorted with laughter as he hung his head, and Jimin could not have been more floored if he tried. Mr. Song looked quietly outraged as he watched the conversation unfold, but he said nothing, letting Jeongguk do the parenting.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d He glanced up. \u201cAnd then what?\u201d\n\u201cI slapped her on her face and pulled her hair.\u201d\n\u201cNice. I mean, not actually\u2014sorry. Give me a minute,\u201d Jeongguk said, holding out one fist to Dasom and holding up another hand to Mr. Song apologetically as Dasom bumped her father\u2019s fist. Jimin was absolutely certain that he was hallucinating the entire scenario. \u201cAnd then?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd then I told her to be nice, but she was just screaming. So then Park  seonsaengnim came and got me,\u201d Dasom finished. Her little hands were folded in her lap, and when she tilted her head to the side, Jeongguk did exactly the same thing, a mirror image of his daughter.\n\u201cOkay. Well, are you sorry that you did that to Hayoon?\u201d Jeongguk asked.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cJeon Dasom,\u201d Mr. Song interrupted sternly, and Dasom cowered slightly, but Jeongguk didn\u2019t even flinch. He just reached forward, grabbed the legs of Dasom\u2019s chair, and pulled her close to him until his knees were touching the edge of her seat.\n\u201cLook at me.\u201d He held up his pointer and middle fingers and directed them at his eyes, and Dasom looked at him immediately. Jeongguk turned his fingers towards Dasom\u2019s eyes, and then he snapped them together and tapped her forehead once as she giggled. \u201cRead the room, Dasom-ah. Sticking up for your friends is good. Keep doing that. Don\u2019t ever  stop  doing that.  Tackling  and  slapping  and  hair pulling, though\u2026 probably not the greatest thing to do at school. I think you can agree with that.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Dad.\u201d\n\u201cIf you have a problem with another student, you need to talk to your teacher and ask him to handle it. Taking matters into your own hands takes guts, but you also have to know when to chill out,\u201d Jeongguk advised, and Jimin watched in mild awe as Dasom hung onto her father\u2019s every word. \u201cThere was a stopping point. A limit. When was it?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Dasom popped her lips a few times pensively. \u201cUh, probably when Hayoon made fun of me. Because that\u2019s when I tackled her.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. So what should you have done instead?\u201d\n\u201cGotten up to tell Park  seonsaengnim about it.\u201d\n\u201cDing-ding-ding! Winne-e-e-er,\u201d Jeongguk said, and Dasom giggled. \u201cHave you apologized to Hayoon?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Now apologize to your teacher, and to your principal, for causing all this trouble,\u201d Jeongguk instructed. Dasom sighed and hopped out of her chair, and then she faced Mr. Song and bowed.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for causing trouble,\u201d she apologized sincerely, holding the bow for a moment before hopping once like a bunny and facing Jimin. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for causing trouble.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, cool. Am I just taking her home now?\u201d Jeongguk wondered, glancing over to Mr. Song.\n\u201cJeongguk-ssi, this is a very serious matter,\u201d Mr. Song said stiffly. \u201cDiscipline should be enforced.\u201d\n\u201cDiscipline?\u201d Jeongguk arched the eyebrow with the piercing in it, and Jimin swallowed the lump in his throat. \u201cWith my utmost respect\u2014she\u2019s seven. Almost eight. She\u2019s here right now. We\u2019ve talked it out. She apologized to the right people. Punishment isn\u2019t teaching. Park  seonsaengnim.\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d Jimin said, surprised that Jeongguk was addressing him, since he felt like more of a fly on the wall.\n\u201cIs Hayoon upset?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo I need to speak with her parents?\u201d\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Jimin replied with honesty. \u201cShe was fine two minutes later. If her parents lodge any kind of complaint, we\u2019ll call you back in to speak with them.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d Jeongguk clapped his hands together once. \u201cDasom-ah, say goodbye.\u201d\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d Dasom said with two more bows as Mr. Song visibly shook his head, because his hands were tied. What discipline could he enforce with a parent who was unwilling to hear a word about it, after all? Jimin was trying not to laugh at the sight of Mr. Song\u2019s veins popping slightly on his forehead as he attempted to remain calm in the face of a rebellious parent\u2014a first for him, surely. Jimin had never witnessed anything like it before.\n\n Hold on. Dasom got bullied once upon a time because of her father. This is the guy. I have to talk to him. \n\n\u201cAh, Jeongguk-ssi?\u201d Jimin said, and Jeongguk grabbed one of Dasom\u2019s braids and tugged gently. Dasom stopped skipping away, giggling as she stumbled backwards and glued herself to her father\u2019s side. \u201cCan we talk privately about this? Maybe in my classroom?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sure. Thank you,\u201d Jeongguk said with a bow to Mr. Song, and then he nudged Dasom between the shoulder blades and let her lead the way out of the principal\u2019s office, Jeongguk and Jimin both in tow.\u00a0\nThe walk down the hallway was silent, especially since most of the kids had left for the day. But when they rounded the corner, Dasom started skipping, and Jeongguk snickered, readjusting his sunglasses on top of his head.\n\u201cIs she a pain in the ass, or is she a good kid when she\u2019s in class with you?\u201d he asked, and Jimin almost choked in surprise.  Is my child a good student? Is my child working hard and following the rules? Do you like my child? Those were the questions he usually got from concerned parents. The phrase \u201cpain in the ass\u201d was typically never included.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a good kid,\u201d Jimin confirmed immediately, noticing Jeongguk\u2019s fond smile as Dasom opened the classroom door and pressed her back to it, heels firmly against the ground to hold it open for the two adults. \u201cSmart. Very articulate. Talks a lot more than the average first grader.\u201d\n\u201cYah,\u201d Jeongguk said in exasperation as Dasom released the door and rushed into the room, attempting to escape any scoldings. But Jimin hurriedly continued.\n\u201cNot in a bad way. She has the vocabulary of a middle school student sometimes,\u201d he said with a laugh as the classroom door closed. He then came to stand in front of his desk and perched on the edge of it, ankles crossed, arms folded. Jeongguk had his hands in his pockets as he watched Dasom stare out the window, palms pressed to the countertop, feet dangling a bit with her toes brushing the ground as she attempted to lift herself up to see more outside.\n\u201cDad! There\u2019s a bird nest in that tree,\u201d Dasom called out, still looking out the window.\n\u201cYeah? What kind of birds?\u201d Jeongguk asked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t know. Can I have your phone?\u201d\n\u201cYou gonna search on Naver?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Dasom hopped down and skipped over to Jeongguk, and Jeongguk immediately slapped his iPhone into her outstretched palm. Dasom turned it and held it up as high as she could to her father\u2019s face, and the screen unlocked. She then hurried back over to the window, and Jimin smiled.\n\u201cShe\u2019s forever curious,\u201d he commented. Jeongguk glanced around, and then he decisively sat on the edge of a student\u2019s desk, arms crossed. Jimin took a moment of silence to appreciate the man across from him, because if ever there was a day that he needed to enjoy some eye candy, it was today. Jeongguk was gorgeous in sinful ways that Jimin didn\u2019t want to admit out loud, mostly because Jeongguk\u2019s seven-year-old daughter was a few meters away. Not once during the day had Jimin ever expected to be seated across from his student\u2019s father while shamelessly wondering what said father looked like without his shirt on. Life had a sense of humor.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Jeongguk turned back to look at Jimin, taking his eyes off Dasom. \u201cAs long as she\u2019s a good kid. Don\u2019t lie to me.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s great,\u201d Jimin confirmed. \u201cI know it\u2019s almost the end of the year, but she\u2019s one of my best students.\u201d\n\u201cDad! How do you spell pigeon?\u201d Dasom hollered. Jeongguk spelled it for her, and then she set the phone down and attempted to hop up onto the countertop so she could sit above the cabinets by the window.\u00a0\n\u201cYah, take your shoes off before you climb up there, you tree monkey,\u201d Jeongguk scolded, but then he paused and glanced at Jimin. \u201cIs she allowed to climb on your cabinets?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s after school hours,\u201d Jimin responded, amused, and Jeongguk nodded.\n\u201cShoes off,\u201d he repeated, so Dasom kicked her street shoes off and then climbed up onto the countertop, grabbing for the phone to search for information about pigeons. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been hoping to meet you.\u201d Jeongguk turned back to Jimin. \u201cDasom loves you. Thinks you\u2019re the greatest person she\u2019s ever met. Says you\u2019re the best teacher in the school.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a gross exaggeration,\u201d Jimin said with a small smile, and Jeongguk shrugged.\n\u201cMm, don\u2019t know about that. I, uh\u2026 I actually wanted to thank you in person,\u201d he said, lowering his voice a little. \u201cFor\u2026 being there for her. Sharing things about you that could make you lose your job.\u201d\n\u201cIn my defense, I checked if what was being said about you was true before sharing,\u201d Jimin said vaguely, but he knew exactly what Jeongguk was talking about.\n\u201cWell, it helped her a lot. I think she\u2019s used to all her friends having a mother and a father and nothing else,\u201d Jeongguk said, slouching slightly in his chair. \u201cNot a thirty-year-old single dad.\u201d\n Christ, he\u2019s two years younger than me, Jimin thought in a fleeting moment of panic. He must have been staring, because Jeongguk snickered.\n\u201cYeah, I was twenty-three when she was born. I can see you doing the math in your head,\u201d Jeongguk accused good-naturedly. \u201cI was young, not smart. Can\u2019t say I ever expected to be a dad, but here we are, vibing. Just the two of us.\u201d Jeongguk looked over his shoulder at Dasom. \u201cIt\u2019s weird.\u201d\n\u201cBeing a dad?\u201d Jimin cocked his head slightly, surprised at the direction the conversation was going. Jeongguk was a bit of an open book, it seemed, perhaps comfortable enough to talk to a peer, or an adult that Dasom trusted.\u00a0\n\u201cMm. It didn\u2019t really sink in until she started talking,\u201d Jeongguk said, sounding amused. \u201cThen I was like, \u2018ah, shit, here we go.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWhat, it didn\u2019t sink in when she was a baby?\u201d Jimin asked, trying not to laugh.\n\u201cNot at all. I mean, besides the sleep deprivation, I spent the first year of her life just carrying her around and showing her to people.\u201d Jeongguk extended both arms out in front of him like he was holding a baby under its armpits. \u201c\u2018Look what I made!\u2019 That\u2019s what I\u2019d say. She was hell with four limbs until she started communicating with me.\u201d\n\u201cLook what I made,\u201d Jimin repeated under his breath, snickering. \u201cVery mature.\u201d\n\u201cI was  young,  not smart,\u201d Jeongguk repeated, grinning. \u201cAnyways, we have a very, uh\u2026 unorthodox way of doing things. Most traditional parents would cry in horror if they knew how I was raising her. But whatever. It\u2019s just the two of us, like I said. So if she\u2019s defending her friend\u2019s honor and bitch-slapping a mean girl, what am I going to do? Ground her? That teaches her nothing.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s right.\u201d Jimin pressed his tongue into his cheek for a moment. \u201cThe girl she tackled is a nightmare. Entitled brat. And I\u2019d get fired for saying that to anyone else and not cherishing each student individually. But Jiwon gets teased all the time, and Dasom always sticks up for her.\u201d\n\u201cGood. I don\u2019t condone violence,\u201d Jeongguk pointed out, and Jimin cracked a smile. \u201cShe definitely shouldn\u2019t have smacked that girl around. But she did what she thought was right, and we talked it out. Lesson learned, no formal discipline needed. As long as she\u2019s not giving anyone a right hook.\u201d\n\u201cA right hook, huh?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. She wants to start boxing,\u201d Jeongguk sighed, sounding pained as Jimin snorted. \u201cBecause I do it at home.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not pigeons!\u201d Dasom suddenly called out, flicking one braid over her shoulder.\u00a0\n\u201cSee if they\u2019re oriental magpies,\u201d Jeongguk suggested, and then he spelled it for her before Dasom could even ask. Once she was distracted again, Jeongguk turned back to Jimin. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, I don\u2019t mean to take up your time. Was there something you wanted to talk about?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no. I just\u2026 I just wanted to let you know that I won\u2019t be punishing her for anything,\u201d Jimin replied. \u201cAnd that if Hayoon\u2019s mother pitches a fit, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I can handle rich mothers,\u201d Jeongguk said with a mischievous grin.\n\u201cCan I ask you\u2026\u201d Jimin started, but Jeongguk switched the ankle he had crossed over the other and tilted his head slightly.\n\u201cAbout Dasom\u2019s mother?\u201d he guessed, and Jimin clicked his tongue and sat back in his chair with a sigh, guilty. Jeongguk\u2019s smile softened, and Jimin\u2019s heart clenched. \u201cShe\u2019s my age. We were together for a little over a year when she got pregnant. Didn\u2019t plan for it. We weren\u2019t married or anything, and she didn\u2019t want to be a mother, so she said she\u2019d just give the baby up for adoption so we could move on with our lives. I fought her every day for months.\u201d\n\u201cAh, wow.\u201d\n\u201cWe agreed to break up about halfway through the pregnancy. She also agreed to have the baby, but she gave me full custody because I wanted the kid, not her,\u201d Jeongguk said in a bit of a trance as he stared at a single spot on Jimin\u2019s desk, like he had told the story a thousand times before. \u201cSo Dasom was born, and I took her home with me. Eunji went back home and carried on with her life.\u201d\n\u201cIs she, uh\u2026 Is she in the picture?\u201d Jimin wondered. \u201cDasom\u2019s\u2014I mean, she\u2019s mentioned her mother before, so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah. She sees Dasom once a month,\u201d Jeongguk replied. \u201cThey have girls\u2019 night. A little sleepover. But it\u2019s not really a mother-daughter relationship. Dasom knows Eunji gave birth to her, but beyond that, there isn\u2019t really\u2026 a connection. They get along well. Love hanging out. But I always tell Eunji that she can see Dasom more than once a month, and she says no. She just doesn\u2019t want to be a mother.\u201d\n\u201cI can understand that,\u201d Jimin tentatively said, and Jeongguk nodded.\n\u201cYeah. She\u2019s a great person. Smart, sweet, works hard. She\u2019s not angry or spiteful. Doesn\u2019t stalk me or ask who I\u2019m dating or anything. Has a boyfriend. Babysits Dasom when I ask. I can\u2019t complain.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hear that very often,\u201d Jimin said. \u201cA good working relationship between parents who are separated.\u201d\n\u201cI got lucky,\u201d Jeongguk stated. \u201cThat\u2019s all. Damn lucky. Yah, Dasom-ah!\u201d\n\u201cYes, Dad?\u201d\n\u201cAre you done bird watching?\u201d\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, well, let\u2019s get going. I don\u2019t think your teacher wants you here all night. Save that for high school,\u201d Jeongguk joked, and Jimin snickered as Dasom hopped off the counter, put her backpack on, grabbed Jeongguk\u2019s phone, and carried it over. With two hands, she held it up to her father, and Jeongguk took it and pocketed it. \u201cSay goodbye.\u201d\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d Dasom said with a grin, hugging Jeongguk\u2019s leg.\n \u201cPolitely, you little demon,\u201d Jeongguk scolded, and Dasom giggled, bowing to Jimin.\n\u201cGoodbye, Park  seonsaengnim,\u201d she said politely. Jimin bowed his head back to her, and Dasom looked rather pleased.\n\u201cWhat time are you scheduled for your conference?\u201d Jimin asked Jeongguk curiously. Jeongguk blinked at him, and then he lifted one knuckle and nudged his eyebrow piercing gently a few times, pursing his lips like he was trying not to laugh.\n\u201cUh, conference,\u201d he repeated like he was tasting the word for the first time. \u201cThat\u2026 is that the email I got from the school last week?\u201d\n\u201cFor end-of-the-year parent-teacher conferences?\u201d Jimin asked, trying not to laugh all the same. \u201cThe one where you log in to the online portal and select a time for a conference with me? And it\u2019s like a bloodbath? And all the spaces are filled now? Except for one? The very last time slot? At quarter to nine at night next Monday?\u201d\n\u201cThat just got worse and worse as you kept talking,\u201d Jeongguk said, circling his pointer finger horizontally as Jimin snickered. \u201cUh, well, I guess that\u2019s\u2026 cool. That\u2019s my only option, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cAfraid so.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll be here on Monday at quarter to nine,\u201d Jeongguk sighed, and then he glanced down at Dasom, who was staring up at him. \u201cThe things I do for you, huh? Quarter to nine is my bedtime. I\u2019m cranky. Now you\u2019re going to have to tuck me in when I get home. I hope you know some good lullabies.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t go to bed until after midnight,\u201d Dasom argued. \u201cI know because last week, you were saying \u2018shit\u2019 at your  Overwatch game and the clock said twelve-oh-four.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so, we\u2019re going to go,\u201d Jeongguk said cheerfully as Jimin burst out laughing, turning and pressing one palm to his desk before walking around it, catching a glimpse of Jeongguk putting a hand jokingly over Dasom\u2019s mouth. \u201cThank you for looking out for her. I\u2019ll be here on Monday night.\u201d\n\u201cYes, see you then. Dasom-ah! See you tomorrow,\u201d Jimin said.\n\u201cOkay, bye!\u201d Dasom called out, skipping and pulling Jeongguk\u2019s hand. As they walked out of the classroom, Jimin heard her say, \u201cDad, can we get bubble tea?\u201d To which Jeongguk responded, \u201cNot on your life, kid, but thanks for trying. Good effort.\u201d\nJimin shook his head as he slowly sat down in his desk chair, knowing that he was supposed to be packing up to go home for the day. But all he could do, like a fool, was think about how on Monday, he would be sitting across from his student\u2019s father again, trying not to mentally undress him while talking about academic progress.\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\n\n  mood: \u201clove again\u201d by dua lipa  \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo he\u2019s a literal D-I-L-F.\u201d\n\u201cWell, when you say it like that, it sounds kinky.\u201d Jimin tossed back the shot of soju, and then he slammed the shot glass onto the table, watching as Kim Namjoon filled it up quickly. With his head propped in his hand while chewing on a toothpick, Kim Taehyung grinned, using one finger to spin his shot glass around on the table of the pub.\n\u201cAnd you said he was hot, so I\u2019m not wrong.\u201d Taehyung clamped the toothpick between his perfect teeth and pushed back his black hair, which was about the only \u201ctypical\u201d thing about him. As a photographer, he didn\u2019t have to adhere to strict dress codes like Jimin did. So Taehyung had a dozen ear piercings (six on each side), a stud in his nose, a smattering of butterflies tattooed on his left collarbone and over his shoulder (visible through his white t-shirt), and fingernails painted neon pink at the moment. He looked and dressed exactly as Jimin did during school holidays, but for now, Jimin had to tone it down.\n\u201cBut have you ever heard of a parent acting like that?\u201d Jimin asked.\n\u201cMost parents just respect the process and agree that their kid was in the wrong to avoid any further humiliation,\u201d Namjoon said, his hand on Taehyung\u2019s thigh as he massaged it lightly. Taehyung always had a smug look on his face when he was with Namjoon, and rightfully so. Namjoon was the hot, smart kind. Dark brown hair, glasses, fit body, damn good job as a pharmacist. The kicker was that once upon a time, he had been Seokjin\u2019s boyfriend. That was how Namjoon had met Taehyung\u2014through Jimin. But Namjoon and Seokjin had amicably and happily parted ways a few years ago, leaving Taehyung to swoop in.\n\u201cNot him. He actually listened to his kid,\u201d Jimin pointed out. \u201cAnd he looked good doing it, too. Jesus, talk about unprofessional.\u201d\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s face it,\u201d Taehyung said, pouring himself another shot of soju. \u201cThe guy you fucked last weekend wasn\u2019t a hot, bisexual single dad with muscles and tattoos.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to tell me that it\u2019s wrong for me to thirst after my student\u2019s father,\u201d Jimin said with a scowl.\n\u201cThat\u2019s so boring. Why would I ever do that?\u201d Taehyung asked, raising one eyebrow. Namjoon snickered and intervened.\n\u201cYou just need a good cockblock,\u201d he decided. \u201cAnd the best one is thinking about how he has a seven-year-old kid.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem to be deterring him from mentally undressing said kid\u2019s father,\u201d Taehyung hissed loudly to Namjoon, and Namjoon smacked Taehyung\u2019s thigh as Jimin burst out laughing. \u201cOkay, but hyung has a point. You fuck the dad, that comes with a kid. Package deal kind of thing.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with fucking a single dad and  forgetting about the kid and treating it as a one-night stand,\u201d Namjoon argued, but Jimin held up both hands and waved them.\n\u201cOkay, hello. Are we forgetting that his kid is my favorite student?\u201d Jimin asked, and Namjoon said \u201cah\u201d as Taehyung tossed back his shot and fired a finger gun at Jimin.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, I forgot. Well, then it\u2019s only a win, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Taehyung declared.\n\u201cHe spent twenty minutes with the guy in an elementary school, babe,\u201d Namjoon stated. \u201cDoesn\u2019t exactly scream \u2018turn-on.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s changing schools after this term is over,\u201d Taehyung replied. \u201cI say we fuck the hot dad and move to a different school. Problem solved.\u201d\n\u201cThis is why I tell you guys nothing,\u201d Jimin sighed as he reached for some of the crispy fried chilli chips. Saturdays were one of the only chances that Jimin had to meet up with his friends. He and Taehyung had gone to school together and were best friends; Namjoon had joined Jimin\u2019s friendship circle because of Seokjin. And Jimin had other friends, the kind of friends that he went to nightclubs with, but nothing compared to Taehyung, Namjoon, and Seokjin.\u00a0\nTaehyung had always stuck by Jimin\u2019s side, the two of them thick as thieves, neither one of them worried about ever getting tied down or dating seriously. Korea, after all, wasn\u2019t the most accepting place when it came to being gay or, in, Taehyung\u2019s case, pansexual. So Jimin and Taehyung had always been wingmen for one another, scouring nightclubs in Itaewon that they knew were safe spaces for the two of them, keeping tabs on one another if they chose to disappear for the night to get laid. But a year ago, Taehyung had fallen head over heels for Namjoon, stars in his eyes, and Jimin had accepted it. Now he was the single one in his friend group, and at thirty-two and still young and hot, he was starting to wonder if settling down or finding someone would be wise.\nThen again, fantasizing about a sinfully hot father of one couldn\u2019t hurt.\n\u201cIs he hot enough for me to photograph?\u201d Taehyung wondered as they continued to snack and drink.\n\u201cYou know what? He must have social media,\u201d Namjoon said, arching one eyebrow. \u201cWhy not look him up? Surely he has an Instagram or something.\u201d\n\u201cOn it. You said \u2018Jeon\u2019 was his family name, right? I\u2019ll find him,\u201d Taehyung declared, and Jimin pinched the bridge of his nose and immediately grabbed another shot of soju, disappointed that shot after shot did nothing to his body\u2019s steel will to never get drunk quickly enough. Jimin watched as Namjoon rested his chin on Taehyung\u2019s shoulder, and Taehyung rolled the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the other. And then\u2014\n\u201cThis has to be him,\u201d Namjoon declared, and Jimin\u2019s heart stopped. \u201cJeon Jeongguk. Wait, is he famous? Jimin-ah.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Famous?\u201d Jimin\u2019s brow furrowed as he leaned in.\n\u201cWell, he has over a hundred thousand Instagram followers,\u201d Namjoon pointed out, and then he grabbed Taehyung\u2019s phone and turned it around. They had, indeed, found Jeongguk\u2019s Instagram page, and Jimin just stared. The information was all there in his bio\u201430, bisexual, dad to one cute little brat (his words), personal trainer. Jimin reached forward and scrolled with one finger, and then he dropped his head on the table with a groan.\n\u201cOh, shit, he\u2019s fucking  hot,\u201d \u00a0Taehyung said with a laugh, because there were videos of Jeongguk offering personal training tips, and in half of them, he was shirtless. Two full sleeves of tattoos, a set of baby\u2019s footprints tattooed right over his heart that had to be Dasom\u2019s. The other pictures or videos featured one very cute little girl, and she did all sorts of things\u2014boxing, ice skating, playing the violin, hanging by her knees upside down on Jeongguk\u2019s (very muscular) arm, rollerblading, and wearing some questionable, high-fashion outfits where some fashion designer named j-hope was tagged.\u00a0\n\u201cOh my God, he\u2019s like one of those Instagram dads,\u201d Namjoon laughed.\n\u201cNo, no, he\u2019s not. Because he\u2019s not doing any of those stupid promotion codes for diet supplements or anything,\u201d Taehyung said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a personal trainer, which means he\u2019s a rare breed to be denying all that shit. Guess he doesn\u2019t give a fuck. Hey, his daughter\u2019s pretty cute.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s my best student,\u201d Jimin said, cautiously lifting his head.\n\u201cAnd your best student\u2019s dad is fucking beautiful,\u201d Taehyung said without shame, and Namjoon nodded in agreement. \u201cHop on that dick. Or let him hop on yours. I don\u2019t know which I\u2019d prefer.\u201d\n\u201cNo one asked you,\u201d Jimin crankily said, rubbing his brow.\n\u201cOh, he has a TikTok, too? Oh, shit, he\u2019s popular on TikTok,\u201d Taehyung laughed, and Namjoon saw Jimin\u2019s facial expression, so he grabbed Taehyung\u2019s phone and locked it, sliding it away.\n\u201cOkay, so, the weatherman said we might get more snow next week,\u201d he said, and Jimin couldn\u2019t help it\u2014he snorted with laughter at the terrible attempt to change the subject.\n\u201cJesus Christ. Sorry. It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d Jimin threw one hand up halfway and let it fall to the table with a  thud before he crawled his fingers to grab more chips. \u201cYou know what the biggest turn-on was? Ask me. Prepare to laugh.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was the biggest turn-on?\u201d Taehyung asked, lacing his fingers together and propping his chin on his knuckles as he blinked sweetly.\n\u201cThe way he disciplined his kid,\u201d Jimin said, and as Namjoon let out a dramatic and fake groan, Jimin laughed. \u201cNo, listen! Listen, you don\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve been teaching for a long fucking time, okay? And most parents are fucking pushovers. But God, the way he walked into the principal\u2019s office like he\u2019d been there before was so  sexy. You should have seen it. He just talked to his kid like she was an intelligent human being and then said goodbye. Refused the school\u2019s bullshit discipline.\u201d\n\u201cThe shit that turns us on in our thirties,\u201d Taehyung sighs, and Namjoon snickered in agreement. \u201cHonestly. Ten years ago, a guy who could funnel two beers in a row was sex on legs and worth a blowjob in the nightclub bathroom. Now I\u2019m turned on by a pharmacist who can tell me which ibuprofen to take without even reading the labels.\u201d\n\u201cWill you shut up?\u201d Namjoon said in fond exasperation.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s sexy,\u201d Taehyung insisted, but then he turned back to Jimin. \u201cGet this guy into bed. Dead serious.\u201d\n\u201cI should probably give him an update on his daughter\u2019s academic progress before I do that,\u201d Jimin said with mild disdain, and Taehyung clicked his tongue, rolling his eyes.\n\u201cPlease. He won\u2019t care about that. Mark my words. I bet he found you just as attractive as you found him.\u201d\n\u201cYou look good in smart casual,\u201d Namjoon added, pointing at Jimin.\u00a0\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean he gave a damn when he was at the school to see why his daughter was in trouble,\u201d Jimin retorted.\n\u201cWhat, so you think that means he doesn\u2019t have eyes or taste?\u201d Taehyung asked, and Jimin snickered. \u201cJimin, you walk into nightclubs and men literally do one-eighties and follow you to the bar.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fucking lie.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it happen.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but that\u2019s when I look  good,\u201d Jimin emphasized. \u201cNot when I\u2019m wearing slacks and a button-up.\u201d\n\u201cYou underestimate yourself,\u201d Taehyung said, shaking his head. \u201cYou said you\u2019re seeing him again on Monday, right? Parent-teacher conference. So talk about his kid and then see if he has any interest beyond that. And report back immediately.\u201d\nJimin braced himself for figurative impact on Monday, and not just because Jeon Jeongguk was on his conference schedule. Parent-teacher conferences for the end of the year were always stressful, because if a child wasn\u2019t performing well or if Jimin had concerns, the parents typically fretted from the other side of the table, desperate for solutions at the eleventh hour. Even further, Jimin had to stay at the school until around nine o\u2019clock just to squeeze each student\u2019s parents in for about fifteen minutes.\nThere were only three weeks until the second semester concluded, but it wasn\u2019t like the break was ever long enough. Jimin looked forward to summer holidays the most, but he would just have to wait patiently for after the first semester of the next year concluded. Until then, he had a class of twenty-two very excitable kids.\n\u201cPark  seonsaengnim, my mom said that she\u2019s going to bring you a present.\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to tell my father about the time I fell asleep?\u201d\n\u201cPark  seonsaengnim, please don\u2019t tell my mother that I didn\u2019t do well on the math test.\u201d\nAll day, Jimin was flooded with concerns from his students, all of which he fielded with reassurance and smiles, even though he was likely to tell the parents absolutely anything they asked to hear because that was his job. And that was exactly what he did when conferences started at four o\u2019clock after dismissal. He spoke with parent after parent, keeping his enthusiasm high and appreciating the respect he received, even if some of the parents had delusions about their child\u2019s behavior or the expectations for first grade. Some mothers asked a thousand questions because it was their first experience. Some fathers sat with stern faces because they had already put two kids through first grade.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just  concerned, as I\u2019m sure you can understand. We don\u2019t want our daughter under the influence of children who misbehave and act out inappropriately.\u201d\n\u201cI can assure you that this incident is not one that will be repeated,\u201d Jimin said in a soothing tone to Hwang Hayoon\u2019s mother, who was sitting cross-legged and speaking in a tone of voice that was dripping with sweetness. Her husband was silent beside her, zoning out but attempting to appear involved.\n\u201cHayoon is a sweet and loving child,\u201d Hayoon\u2019s mother insisted. \u201cAnd I do hope that she\u2019s being treated as such by her teacher and her classmates alike. She deserves the best education that we can offer to her.\u201d\n\u201cI completely agree,\u201d Jimin lied with a practiced smile. \u201cAs I said, this is not a situation that will repeat. The other child involved has been disciplined. No need to worry.\u201d\n\u201cVoice your concerns, darling,\u201d Hayoon\u2019s mother said, nudging her husband. Hayoon\u2019s father cleared his throat and shifted himself in the seat.\n\u201cUh, yes. Yes, as long as the other child was disciplined,\u201d he said, and then he checked his watch. Jimin, always in tune with the parents across the table from him, immediately provided an academic progress update and dismissed them, because the conversation was going absolutely nowhere, and Jimin had already as good as finalized Hayoon\u2019s good grades. It was relatively pointless.\n\u201cDamn. I should\u2019ve brought some soju. You look like you need it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n  mood: \u201cmotive\u201d (with doja cat) by ariana grande  \n\n\u00a0\nJimin whipped his head up and away from his laptop, and he inwardly cursed Taehyung to hell for perpetuating indecent thoughts in his head. It was quarter to nine on the dot, and Jimin\u2019s classroom door was open, and there was Jeongguk. He was wearing black pants with black boots, a black turtleneck, and a black leather jacket. Dangling from one hand was a black and silver motorcycle helmet, and Jimin wanted to evaporate on the spot.  Of course he has a motorcycle. Why wouldn\u2019t he? Having a motorcycle just solidifies his status, doesn\u2019t it? Jesus Christ. \n\u201cHi. Come on in,\u201d Jimin offered. Jeongguk strolled into the room, his short hair parted to the side and combed back off his face, that damn eyebrow piercing still in. When he got close enough, he bowed politely to Jimin with a small smile, so Jimin gestured to the open chair. Jeongguk pushed his tongue into his cheek as he looked around for a place to set his helmet, but he finally just settled into the chair across from Jimin and tucked the helmet underneath the seat. Then he scooted the chair at an angle, crossed one leg over the other, and stared at Jimin.\n\u201cSo.\u201d Jimin clicked his tongue and folded his hands, Dasom\u2019s file ready to reference. \u201cWe can start by discussing how Dasom\u2019s academic year has looked so far and what her progress on her objectives has been. We can chat about any concerns you might have. And then\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHow professional is this meant to be?\u201d Jeongguk interrupted. Jimin swallowed his next words and digested what Jeongguk just said, picking at the corner of Dasom\u2019s file with his thumbnail.\u00a0\n\u201cA teacher speaking with a parent,\u201d Jimin stated plainly.  Or I could tell you that my friends want me to get dicked down by you. \n\u201cYou know you have all my respect,\u201d Jeongguk said point-blank. \u201cFor doing what you do. For educating my daughter. For sticking up for her.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Jimin took a quiet deep breath as he watched Jeongguk switch which leg was crossed.\n\u201cCan I be honest with you?\u201d Jeongguk then said. \u201cAt the risk of, uh\u2026 venturing into unprofessional territory.\u201d\n\u201cBy all means,\u201d Jimin agreed, trying not to let his relief show on his face. He had been upright and stoic and professional for hours, and no matter how hard he tried, there was no use in scolding himself into upholding his values for another fifteen minutes. What was a job without a little joy, especially if said joy came in the form of a sinfully handsome thirty-year-old single dad?\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to know any of that,\u201d Jeongguk said, waving his hand dismissively. \u201cThe academic stuff. Doesn\u2019t matter. Is she failing anything? In first grade?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cIs she a problem?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d\n\u201cIs she struggling?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cCool. Is she a decent human being?\u201d Jeongguk asked, cocking his head to the side a bit. Jimin raised both eyebrows, slightly startled by the question. Jeongguk noticed, so he clarified. \u201cLook, first and second grade are important. I\u2019ve had her at home most of the time up until now, right? So here she is at school, acting like a real human on her own. So I\u2019m asking you, since you see her every day, if you think she\u2019s a good kid. Not a good student. A good human being. Is she nice? Does she listen? Does she make friends? Does she have a heart? Shit like that.\u201d\n\u201cAh. That\u2019s\u2026\u201d Jimin puffed air into his cheeks in thought for a moment, and then he tilted his head quickly like a curious dog listening to a master. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ve never really gotten that question before.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if she\u2019s a little shit now, then I have work to do at home, so I\u2019d like to know that kind of thing, you know?\u201d Jeongguk said, shrugging. Jimin chuckled.\n\u201cShe\u2019s very nice. She always listens. She\u2019s friends with just about everyone except for those mean girls. And she has a heart of gold. She\u2019s funny, too. Makes all the kids laugh. Quick. Very quick. Never misses a thing. She\u2019s a decent human being. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s all for her. How about you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Jimin said, startled. Jeongguk slung one elbow up to rest on the table.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been at this all day, and you still look good. How long have you been a teacher?\u201d Jeongguk asked, mixing a compliment with a polite question. Jimin raised one eyebrow. He was just in black slacks and a white button-up, but the clothing fit him well, and Namjoon  had said he looked good in smart casual. And Jeongguk, of all people, noticed.\n\u201cEight years. What does me looking good have anything to do with a conference about Dasom?\u201d he asked with a teasing lilt in his voice, trying not to let his pulse quicken.  This was bordering on unprofessional, but Jimin had absolutely no energy left to care. In fact, it was mildly thrilling.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d Jeongguk said, grinning. \u201cHow did you end up as a teacher?\u201d\n\u201cHad a great high school literature teacher who inspired me,\u201d Jimin responded. \u201cDecided to go with the younger kids so I could get to them early and have a positive impact on their lives.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Dasom loves you,\u201d Jeongguk stated, and Jimin pursed his lips, feeling his ears burn a little. \u201cShe never shuts up about you. She comes home every day and tells me things about you.\u201d\n\u201cWell, she\u2019s likely over-exaggerating, but that\u2019s very kind of her.\u201d\n \u201cIs  she exaggerating, though?\u201d Jeongguk asked, a sparkle in his eyes. \u201cShe  did tell me months ago during that bullying incident that you said you liked men. Did you lie to her to make her feel better?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I wouldn\u2019t lie to her like that,\u201d Jimin replied, and his pulse did, indeed, begin to race as he picked up a pen and began to twirl it between his fingers as he spoke. The school was virtually empty, since no one liked to schedule conferences close to nine o\u2019clock. What was the harm in being honest? Jeongguk was here with a motorcycle helmet and a shit-eating grin on his face and very little interest in talking about Dasom\u2019s academic achievements. Jimin wasn\u2019t a teenager. He was a thirty-two-year-old man with eyes. He knew what Jeongguk was doing.\n\u201cThat explains a lot, then,\u201d Jeongguk stated, but he didn\u2019t clarify any further, even though Jimin was curious. He held his tongue and shrugged.\n\u201cDated a few girls back in high school, but it never lasted,\u201d he explained vaguely.\u00a0\n\u201cFair enough. I\u2019m more male-leaning, anyways,\u201d Jeongguk remarked flippantly, watching Jimin play with the pen. \u201cI\u2019m sure your partner must appreciate you a lot for what you do.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m single.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Jeongguk said, and Jimin burst out laughing the same time that Jeongguk pressed his tongue behind his top teeth with a wicked grin. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me that that was smooth. I know it was.\u201d\n\u201cAre you  flirting  with me at a parent-teacher conference for your  daughter?\u201d Jimin asked with emphasis, still laughing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only flirting if it\u2019s working. Otherwise, it\u2019s just fishing for information,\u201d Jeongguk replied, shrugging with the same one-dimpled grin.  Jesus, no wonder Dasom\u2019s such a cute little angel. She took all of his good looks. Jimin propped one elbow on the table and rested his fist against his lips momentarily. Then he rubbed his pointer finger against his bottom lip before flicking it at the floor towards the helmet.\n\u201cYou have a motorcycle.\u201d\n\u201cKawasaki Ninja,\u201d Jeongguk replied. \u201cBlack and grey. Had her for about three years. Dasom wants to go for a ride on it with me. She\u2019s delusional.\u201d\n\u201cAt least she tries.\u201d\n\u201cShe has audacity, if nothing else,\u201d Jeongguk said with a grin. \u201cHave you ever ridden on a motorcycle?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t say that I have, no.\u201d\n\u201cFirst time for everything,\u201d Jeongguk commented casually, but Jimin didn\u2019t miss the way Jeongguk\u2019s eyes scanned him head to toe in a flash.\n\u201cFirst time for what? Riding?\u201d Jimin asked innocently, and Jeongguk choked on his own breath, coughing and hitting his fist against his chest a few times as Jimin fought a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Maybe one day, huh?\u201d\n\u201cCould be fun,\u201d Jeongguk remarked, finally regaining his composure. \u201cYou know, when I asked how professional this was meant to be, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou obviously weren\u2019t expecting to talk about motorcycles. I know,\u201d Jimin said with a little sigh, and Jeongguk snickered. \u201cIt\u2019s almost nine o\u2019clock. I\u2019ve been at this all day. And most parents who came in spoke to me like I\u2019m some higher power who can perform miracles with their child. So this is\u2026 refreshing. Talking with someone my age on my level.\u201d\n\u201cOh? You\u2019re thirty?\u201d\n\u201cThirty-two. Close,\u201d Jimin teased, and Jeongguk\u2019s mouth formed a silent \u201cah.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to overstay my welcome if it\u2019s almost nine o\u2019clock. I\u2019m sure you want to go home,\u201d Jeongguk offered. \u201cSince I\u2019ve performed my parental duty by attending this conference, and I believe you have to be back here in less than twelve hours.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a glamorous job,\u201d Jimin lamented, and Jeongguk gave him a wry smile, reaching down to pick up his helmet. \u201cAre you, uh\u2026 busy with work most days?\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Jeongguk propped the helmet in his lap. \u201cI split my time between work and home. I\u2019m a personal trainer. I have a gym about ten minutes from here, so I spend the mornings and afternoons there. I pick Dasom up from school every day.\u201d\n\u201cYou have your own gym?\u201d Jimin arched one eyebrow, and Jeongguk grinned.\n\u201cWhy, you want some personal training sessions? I\u2019ll give you a nice discount, seeing as you\u2019re my kid\u2019s teacher,\u201d he joked. \u201cIt\u2019s a small little gym. Nothing major. Just enough for me to do my job. Offer stands. Let me know.  After Dasom finishes first grade, of course. Which is soon. Wouldn\u2019t want to overstep.\u201d\nThe wicked and playful gleam in Jeongguk\u2019s eyes and the way he was fighting back a wider grin was devastatingly sexy. Jimin cracked his knuckles, wondering how the hell he had ended up in a situation where his student\u2019s father was hitting on him with absolutely no shame. All because Dasom smacked a girl around. The universe was laughing at Jimin, and Jimin wanted in on the joke.\n\u201cI\u2019m inclined to think that this  may qualify as overstepping,\u201d Jimin mentioned as Jeongguk stood up, helmet under one arm.\n\u201cShould I see myself to the principal\u2019s office?\u201d Jeongguk asked, and Jimin stifled a laugh, shaking his head as he, too, stood up.\n\u201cGreat to chat with you about Dasom\u2019s academic progress and achievements,\u201d he said, and Jeongguk let out a bark of laughter.\n\u201cThis entire conversation just tells me that I have nothing to worry about,\u201d he replied. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you before the end of the semester. If not, then, uh\u2026 take care, Park  seonsaengnim. And the offer always stands. For personal training, I mean. If it interests you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the motorcycle ride?\u201d Jimin asked, slipping his hands into his pockets as Jeongguk started to walk backwards towards the door. He grinned, pulling a pair of fingerless black gloves from his pockets. As he put them on, helmet still under one arm, he shrugged.\n\u201cDepends on what qualifies as overstepping,\u201d he teased, and then, gloves on, he twirled the helmet in his hands and held it out in Jimin\u2019s general direction. \u201cSee you.\u201d\nJimin waited until he felt Jeongguk was long gone down the hallway before he deflated in sheer relief, pressing both palms to the table for a moment with his head bowed. He wasn\u2019t one to ever slip into semi-unprofessional territory, but the parents who had preceded Jeongguk were\u2026 not Jeongguk. Jimin feared he was absolutely doomed, especially when he heard the kickstart of a motorcycle. Startled, he turned and glanced out the window of his classroom, only to see the headlights of the aforementioned Kawasaki Ninja and Jeongguk with his helmet on, adjusting his gloves under the fluorescent lights of the parking lot. And then he grabbed the handlebars and took off into the night, and Jimin thought of several curse words to utter out loud before settling on, \u201cfucking hell.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[moodboard by the LOML birthday princess]\n\n\n~ ~ ~\n\n\n\u201cPark \n\nseonsaengnim.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes? Ah. Yes, Dasom-ah,\u201d Jimin said, folding his hands politely and turning away from his laptop after being momentarily startled. The students were cleaning up the classroom for the end of the day, and Dasom\u2019s assigned job was to wipe down all the individual whiteboards that the kids used for mathematics. Dasom had just slammed most of the whiteboards down onto Jimin\u2019s desk after carrying them over, the tiny spray bottle between her teeth, the cloth over one shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she apologized when Jimin gave her a look and handed her a sanitizing wipe. She sheepishly wiped the little spray bottle, and then she sprayed the whiteboard on top and started wiping it clean of all the red marker stains.\n\n\n\u201cDasom-ah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be doing your cleaning task at your desk,\u201d Jimin pointed out, amused.\n\n\n\u201cDoyoung is wiping down the desks,\u201d she commented, wiggling her head a little as she worked. Today, her hair was in a messy top knot with a navy blue scarf tied like a headband, and all Jimin could think about was that Jeongguk was the one who always styled her hair. \u201cSo I decided to move over here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMhm. Jiwon-ah! Careful with that,\u201d Jimin called out, and Jiwon nodded and bowed apologetically, taking care with the push broom she was using with another student\u2019s assistance.\n\n\n\u201cPark \n\nseonsaengnim.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, Dasom,\u201d Jimin said, eyes flicking back to Dasom as she wiped down the next whiteboard.\n\n\n\u201cMy dad thinks you\u2019re cute.\u201d\n\n\nJimin held his next breath to keep from choking on it, and Dasom spritzed the next whiteboard and looked up at Jimin, seeking a reaction. When she saw how silent he was, she gave him a toothless grin, because she was missing one of her front teeth, a recent occurrence. It was Friday, and she had come in on Wednesday without that tooth.\n\n\n\u201cDo your work, Dasom-ah,\u201d Jimin scolded lightly.\n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Dasom said with a small bow, and she kept working in silence for just a moment. But then\u2014 \u201cI asked him if he thought you were cute and he said yes, so now I\u2019m here to ask you if \n\nyou \n\nthink \n\nhe\u2019s \n\ncute.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd \n\nI\u2019m \n\nhere to ask you to do your work,\u201d Jimin said, folding his hands and gently resting his chin on his knuckles as Dasom looked up with the same grin, unperturbed.\n\n\n\u201cI was just curious,\u201d she said with a shrug, still cleaning as she spoke. \u201cHe said that you\u2019re a great teacher for me, so I asked him if he liked you, and he said you\u2019re cute. Which is really gross, but he\u2019s my dad, so do you think \n\nhe\u2019s\n\n cute?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJeon Dasom,\u201d Jimin firmly said, and this time, Dasom clamped her mouth shut with a tiny giggle. She finished cleaning the whiteboards, and then she put them back into the right place and skipped away to retrieve her backpack. Once she had it on both shoulders like the rest of the kids, she waved enthusiastically to Jimin, and Jimin pointed abruptly to the door. Dasom covered her mouth with both hands, giggling again, and then she skipped out the door with her friends, surely to go and meet Jeongguk as he picked her up like he said he always did.\n\n\n\u201cRough day?\u201d\n\n\nWith the classroom empty, Jimin glanced up from his laptop. Seokjin was strolling into the classroom, hands in his pockets, glasses on. His footsteps were quiet from his slippers, and he perched on the edge of a desk close to Jimin.\n\n\n\u201cDasom,\u201d Jimin slowly and carefully said, and Seokjin raised his eyebrows expectantly, \u201ctold me that her father thinks I\u2019m \n\ncute.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cScandalous.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd she wanted to know if I thought \n\nhe \n\nwas cute.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, so she\u2019s a little matchmaker,\u201d Seokjin said with a laugh, crossing his arms and his ankles simultaneously as he leaned. \u201cShe has a lot of nerve, that one. If one of my students ever asked me that, they wouldn\u2019t. They know better.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing Dasom has, it\u2019s the nerve,\u201d Jimin sighed, rubbing his forehead.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you say to her?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI told her to finish cleaning.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSmart choice. I would\u2019ve gone with, \u2018tell him I said he\u2019s a D-I-L-F.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, because I hate my job so much that I\u2019d be okay with getting fired,\u201d Jimin joked, and Seokjin snickered.\n\n\n\u201cI mean, damn,\u201d he said, shaking his head slowly. \u201cMust mean that her dad\u2019s talking about you at home. Or she\u2019s asking him about you, and he\u2019s answering. That spices things up a little. Especially after that conference you had.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not letting a seven-year-old set me up with her father,\u201d Jimin said crankily, dropping his face into both hands as Seokjin laughed.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be eating your own words soon,\u201d he predicted. \u201cEspecially since you\u2019re into him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not \n\ninto him. \n\nI barely know him. I\u2019d just\u2026 you know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSit on his face.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Jimin said while throwing one hand up, and Seokjin\u2019s shoulders shook with laughter. \u201cGod, is that too much to ask? Why does everything have to be complicated? Is it not enough to just want to sit on a beautiful man\u2019s face?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the intention behind the face-sitting,\u201d Seokjin decided. \u201cYou have to mean it. \n\nAnd \n\nyou have to be willing to let him rail you. \n\nConfident \n\nenough to let a younger man with a seven-year-old daughter rail you into oblivion.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis is a wholesome conversation for my first grade classroom,\u201d Jimin commented, and they both laughed, knowing full well that this was hardly the most scandalous conversation that had been held between teachers in this elementary school. The shit that Jimin heard in the teachers\u2019 lounge sometimes amongst respectable, revered teachers was unbelievable.\n\n\n\u201cConfidence, Jimin-ssi,\u201d Seokjin said, and Jimin clicked his tongue, rolling his eyes.\n\n\n\u201cI have plenty of confidence. But I\u2019m not twenty-two anymore. I have taste. I\u2019d let him top me as long as he did a good job,\u201d he said, and Seokjin grinned, pushing off the desk and cracking his back by twisting his torso.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the fact that you think he wouldn\u2019t do a good job that has me laughing,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d do well.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTo satisfy \n\nyou?\u201d \n\nSeokjin snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass on your best days, and I\u2019ve never even gotten you into bed. Good luck to Dasom\u2019s father if he has the privilege. I\u2019m going to grade some science tests before I go. Are you sticking around for much longer?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m finished.\u201d Jimin shut his laptop. \u201cCounting down the days at this point.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou and me both.\u201d\n\n\nJimin packed up his bag as Seokjin left the room singing to himself, and he headed straight for home, exhausted. All he had to do was make it through a few more easy weeks, and then he\u2019d get the small break at the end of the semester that he so desperately needed. Second semester was always the most difficult, mostly because of the interruptions from various holidays.\n\n\nBesides the Lunar New Year, the semester was slated to end just before Valentine\u2019s Day. Each day, Jimin spent time appreciating the twenty-two kids he had in his class, knowing that he would have to let them go soon. He was waiting patiently to receive his new school assignment, unless Jangseong intended to let him overstay his welcome, but all he could do was hope that his next school assignment wasn\u2019t too far from home or too left-field for his teaching style.\u00a0\n\n\nIn what Jimin thought was a rather smart move on her part, Dasom was an angel for the remainder of the semester, never once bringing up her father to Jimin again. Jimin was guilty, though, of checking Jeongguk\u2019s Instagram page every few days, intrigued by what he was posting. One post was Dasom walking down a long hallway with incredibly dramatic theatrics and twirls, and the man laughing behind the camera was most certainly not Jeongguk. In the video, Dasom was wearing a cute little outfit in a vibrant shade of yellow, and Jeongguk\u2019s caption was: \n\nI left them alone for one hour. ONE. HOUR. \n\nAnd in the video, he had tagged j-hope again. So Jimin had clicked on the profile, only to find out that j-hope was the one-man genius behind the fashion label BLUE SIDE, Jimin owned some of the label\u2019s clothing, and Jeongguk referred to this man as Dasom\u2019s \u201cuncle.\u201d\n\n\nThe most recent post, though, was a video followed by a series of pictures of Dasom without her front tooth, beaming ear-to-ear. In the video, Dasom was standing on a chair in front of a bathroom mirror, Jeongguk visibly filming (in a white t-shirt, but who was focusing on Jeongguk besides Jimin?). In the video, Dasom was huffing and puffing and hyping herself up, and Jeongguk was playfully and repeatedly punching her shoulder in support. Then he counted to three, and Dasom let out a battle cry before yanking the tooth right out of her mouth. Jimin hadn\u2019t realized he had been smiling like a fool at his phone until the video ended, and that was when he exited Instagram, embarrassed.\n\n\nWhen the last day of the semester arrived, Jimin found himself with a bunch of first graders hugging his legs and torso, giggling and asking for attention. Typically, students were polite and respectful and never touched, but Jimin had made it quite clear that he was open to hugs and affection and that he cared about his students, so even Hayoon was seeking a hug.\n\n\n\u201cOkay, okay! Off you go!\u201d Jimin called out, clapping his hands and pointing to the classroom door. With the eager excitement of several litters of puppies, his twenty-two students departed his classroom for the final time, hurrying to grab their shoes and belongings and head out to the buses or to the car loop for parent pick-up. Teachers of the higher grades supervised the bus loop, so Jimin headed straight for the car loop, ruffling the hair of several of his boys and complimenting a few of his girls on their pretty paper crowns that they had all made to celebrate finishing first grade.\n\n\n\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d Jimin said with a bow when he reached the car loop, accepting a card from Jiwon\u2019s mother with both hands.\n\n\n\u201cShe just loved having you as her teacher,\u201d Jiwon\u2019s mother said, gripping Jiwon tightly with pride. \u201cShe was scared when she found out she had a male teacher, but she\u2019s just had the best school year. Thank you for setting the tone for her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe was an absolute joy. Jiwon-ah, you\u2019re going to do so well in second grade,\u201d Jimin complimented, crouching and offering his hand for a high-five. Jiwon smiled, her glasses slipping down her nose a little as she high-fived Jimin. \u201cVery proud of you. Have a wonderful spring vacation before next semester begins.\u201d\n\n\nJiwon\u2019s mother helped her into the backseat of the car, and Jimin stepped back, bowing his head to a few other parents who passed by, a few of them parents of his former students.\n\n\n\u201cThinking of directing traffic as a side gig?\u201d\n\n\nJimin glanced to the right, his heart cartwheeling. Jeongguk was approaching, wearing black pants, a dark grey loosely fitted turtleneck tucked in, a long black coat, and a black baseball cap. His black face mask was pulled down to his chin, and he nudged Dasom forward with one hand, twirling his car keys around his pointer finger with the other hand. Dasom was wearing her school uniform and her winter coat, a white beanie with a pom-pom on it covering her two French braids, her hands gloved. She skipped up to Jimin, but then she stuttered and glanced over her shoulder, clutching what looked like a card in her hands.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, go ahead. Come on,\u201d Jeongguk encouraged, waving one hand. \u201cYou made it. Go ahead.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut \n\nyou \n\nput\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDasom-ah,\u201d Jeongguk interrupted loudly, so Dasom giggled and turned back around, handing Jimin the card that had glitter on it. Jimin accepted it with a small bow, and then he crouched down to be just below her eye level, since she was rather petite.\n\n\n\u201cDo you want me to read it right now and embarrass you?\u201d he asked, and Dasom crossed her arms tightly and shrugged, rubbing her lips together. Jimin looked at the front of the card: I LOVE YOU was written in perfect Korean in glitter, and there was a heart drawn on the front of the light pink cardstock with a picture Dasom had drawn of her holding Jimin\u2019s hand, two stick figures with smiles. Jimin cracked open the card, and he caught something that began to slide out without looking at it first.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Hi, Park \n\nseonsaengnim, \n\nit\u2019s Jeon Dasom. I made you a card to say thank you for teaching me this year. You taught me a lot of spelling. My dad helped me spell some words in this card. You\u2019re my favorite teacher ever. I love you,\u2019\u201d Jimin read, and then he lowered the card. Dasom was standing there with both hands covering her face, but she hadn\u2019t moved. \u201cWell, this is the most beautiful card I\u2019ve gotten all day.\u201d\n\n\nDasom dropped her hands, eyes narrowed. \u201cAre you lying?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot lying. You made this yourself \n\nand \n\nthe spelling is great,\u201d Jimin complimented. \u201cMay I hang this on my fridge?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Dasom agreed, looking embarrassed. Then she stood on her tiptoes, peering over the top of the card. In nothing more than a hissing whisper, she added, \u201cDid you see it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Jimin glanced down at the thing that had slid out of the card that he had caught with his thumb. Dasom scooted as close as she could, speaking so Jeongguk couldn\u2019t hear her, even though he was getting closer in suspicion.\n\n\n\u201cI \n\ntold you \n\nthat Dad thinks you\u2019re cute,\u201d she whispered.\n\n\n\u201cDasom-ah. Say goodbye,\u201d Jeongguk requested, getting close enough. \u201cSorry about her. Last day of the semester. Come on, baby bear. Let\u2019s get going.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Dasom swayed on the spot a little, and then she suddenly threw her arms around Jimin\u2019s neck. Jimin almost fell over in his crouching position, but he caught Dasom and hugged her tightly, smiling.\n\n\n\u201cSee you in second grade,\u201d Jimin said lightheartedly, even though he already had his new assignment the next town over at Kyodong Elementary School.\n\n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Dasom said hurriedly, and then she leapt away from Jimin like he was on fire, squealing to herself like she had just said something horrific, grabbing Jeongguk\u2019s leg and then throwing her entire face right into his stomach in dramatized shame before grabbing his coat and hiding herself inside it. Jimin snickered and stood up, and then he finally glanced down at what was underneath his thumb. It was a sleek white matte business card. In black letters with a gold drop shadow: GOLDEN PERSONAL TRAINING. An email address. A business phone number. Jeongguk\u2019s name and qualifications. With trembling fingers, Jimin flipped the card over, and there was a different phone number written in pen\u2014likely a personal number. Nothing else.\n\n\n\u201cThanks for everything,\u201d Jeongguk said, and then he pulled Dasom out of his coat and threw her over his right shoulder as she giggled, kicking petulantly and thumping his back with her small fists. \u201cEnjoy your spring vacation.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPut me \n\ndown, \n\nyou monster!\u201d Dasom called out.\n\n\n\u201cTakes one to know one, you little demon,\u201d Jeongguk retorted, and Dasom giggled again, still kicking. \u201cSay goodbye.\u201d Jeongguk spun around so that his back was to Jimin, and Dasom lifted her head and shoulders.\n\n\n\u201cBye!\u201d she called out with a wave, and then Jeongguk carried her right over to the black Hyundai IONIQ that was parked at the curb. He set Dasom on her feet and helped her into the backseat, closing the door. Jeongguk then hesitated before opening the driver\u2019s side door.\n\n\n\u201cCall me sometime. If you want. No pressure,\u201d he said to Jimin, pressing his tongue into his cheek before yanking the door open and dropping into the driver\u2019s seat. Ignoring how cold his hands were and that his cheeks were stinging from the winter winds, Jimin just fought back a grin and watched the car pull away from the curb.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nSpring vacation was typically cold with some snow, given that it was the end of February. On the first few days, Jimin spent his nights cooking with Namjoon and Taehyung, making warm soups and stews and watching movies instead of taking a cab to Itaewon to enjoy the nightlife. After an absolutely exhausting semester and academic year, Jimin had very little time to prepare for his new school placement, but most classrooms were cookie cutter. He had packed up everything at Jangseong for an easy move to Kyodong, and he wasn\u2019t alone; several other teachers were migrating as well, but Seokjin wasn\u2019t.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to have to find someone else to bitch to,\u201d he had complained over the phone. \u201cCan we just have weekly phone calls so I can let it all out?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKyodong is in Gangnam, hyung. It has a reputation,\u201d Jimin had said, leading Seokjin to snicker.\n\n\n\u201cAh, the rich get richer. Have fun with that!\u201d\n\n\nBut now it was a Thursday evening, and Jimin was home by himself, watching his large pot of \n\nsamgyetang \n\nbubbling on the stovetop, thinking about eating for his health. And as he absentmindedly stirred (not that it needed to be stirred after being pressure cooked), he flipped Jeongguk\u2019s business card over between his fingers.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m an idiot.\n\n\n\nDasom\u2019s card was, indeed, pinned to his fridge with a magnet. But Jeongguk\u2019s business card had been on there as well until five minutes ago. Now, with his food still cooking, Jimin was having terrible thoughts.\n\n\n\nHe as good as told you to call him. He literally made the first move. He wants you to call, and you\u2019re standing here at your grown age pretending that he doesn\u2019t.\n\n\n\n\u201cFuck it,\u201d Jimin murmured, snatching up his phone from the countertop. He wasn\u2019t shy by any means, but something about Jeongguk made him feel like his heart was in his throat, and it had to be the fact that Jeongguk was both younger and a father. That was a lethal combination for Jimin. His fingers felt clammy as he typed in Jeongguk\u2019s number that was scrawled in pen on the back of the business card, and then he stared at his bubbling soup until his vision blurred.\n\n\n\nJust do it. You\u2019ll regret it if you don\u2019t. Spring vacation is only for so long.\n\n\n\nIt was almost eight o\u2019clock at night, so Jimin figured it had to be a decent time. He pressed the phone to his ear, closing his eyes and suddenly hoping Jeongguk didn\u2019t answer.\n\n\n\u201cHello, this is Jeongguk.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh. So it\u2019s not a fake number,\u201d Jimin said right away on instinct, and he wanted to smack himself, but then he heard Jeongguk let out a breathy laugh.\n\n\n\u201cHold on, hold on,\u201d Jeongguk said with a small grunt, sounding like he was getting up or moving around. The muffled background noise faded as Jimin shifted his footing nervously, chewing on his bottom lip. \u201cSorry. Hi. I wasn\u2019t expecting you to call. That business card was a long shot. But I\u2019m glad you did.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, am I interrupting your night?\u201d Jimin asked.\n\n\n\u201cNo, no. I was just watching \n\nHaikyuu!! \n\nwith Dasom,\u201d Jeongguk said, and Jimin grinned. \u201cJust\u2026 yeah. Okay. She\u2019s good. I watch with her so we can work on her Japanese, but also because I\u2019m a shameless anime nerd. But she\u2019s just on the couch with a lollipop. That will tide her over for ages.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood show choice,\u201d Jimin commended. \u201cYou weren\u2019t expecting me to call?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, not really. Here I am, hitting on my kid\u2019s teacher and handing out my phone number,\u201d Jeongguk said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m not usually that bold, but\u2026 yeah. Anyways, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 You called.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI did. Mostly because I was curious,\u201d Jimin admitted.\n\n\n\u201cCurious about why I left my phone number in my kid\u2019s card for you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I guess\u2026\u201d Jeongguk laughed mostly to himself. \u201cI guess it depends on what kind of line you want to cross or how weird you think it is. If it\u2019s weird, then no big deal. It was worth a shot. Uh, I just\u2014I mean, it\u2019s up to you. I was just\u2014okay, shit. I\u2019m horrible at this part. Help me out, here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you want to go out this weekend?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s \n\nwhat I\u2019m trying to say,\u201d Jeongguk sighed in relief, and Jimin snickered. \u201cThe whole asking part of this is just\u2014God, that was shocking. Sorry. Yes. That\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at. I\u2019m trying to see if you want to meet up and maybe go out one night. See if it\u2019s worth a shot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, sure. I\u2019d like that,\u201d Jimin agreed, pressing one palm into the countertop to keep himself upright. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you free on Saturday?\u201d Jeongguk asked, lowering his voice a little. \u201cThis Saturday would actually be really convenient. This is the Saturday that Dasom spends the night at her mother\u2019s place. Built-in babysitter. Can you do Saturday?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can. How do you feel about ice skating?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIce skating?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Jimin turned his back to the countertop to lean. \u201cThere\u2019s an ice skating rink in the park right now. It\u2019s still up. Just popped into my head. Could be ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI like ridiculous. I can pick you up,\u201d Jeongguk offered. \u201cSeven o\u2019clock?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSeven o\u2019clock,\u201d Jimin agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll, uh\u2026 yeah. I\u2019ll text you my address.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlright. Yeah. Saturday at seven o\u2019clock. I\u2019ll see you\u2014wait, am I still addressing you formally?\u201d Jeongguk asked, and Jimin snorted.\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to still address me as a teacher, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking,\u201d he said, entertained. \u201cFirst name is just fine.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay. Then I\u2019ll see you on Saturday at seven o\u2019clock, Jimin-ssi,\u201d Jeongguk said, and Jimin almost crumpled the business card in his fist. \u201cThanks for calling me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou \n\ndid \n\nleave your number,\u201d Jimin said with a laugh. \u201cGoodnight, Jeongguk-ssi.\u201d\n\n\nJimin wanted to taste the food he made, but even as he devoured his dinner, his mind was elsewhere. He was good at ice skating, since it had been one of his hobbies of choice growing up, but Jeongguk hadn\u2019t even hesitated to agree to the left-field date idea.\u00a0\n\n\nA date. This was most definitely a date. Jimin was going on a date with his (former) student\u2019s hot dad. To most people, it was a rash decision or a decision made in haste, but Jimin was thirty-two fucking years old, and he deserved this. He considered for a moment what Namjoon and Taehyung had mentioned\u2014Jeongguk came with a built-in kid. Dasom was a given no matter what, but did Jimin care? Was that a dealbreaker?\n\n\nJimin had always known that being a father wasn\u2019t really in the cards for him. He had always been most interested in men, which came with the solidified idea that he was more likely to be a father to a dog or cat, and he had never minded. But here was Jeongguk with a seven-year-old daughter, so was Jimin suddenly supposed to change his tune? Not that his tune was strong; it wasn\u2019t really a concept that he had forged an opinion on over the years, more prone to just falling in and out of bed with beautiful strangers and never thinking twice about kids. But now he had a date arranged with Jeongguk, so the idea was creeping back up into his brain.\n\n\nSaturday came, and Jimin woke up with a churning stomach that he strictly attributed to nerves and not butterflies. Breakfast was just yogurt with granola and honey, and he made a purposeful trip to get a strong coffee to keep him alive into the afternoon.\n\n\nSince the temperatures were still nearly freezing, Jimin figured it was best to dress warmly while still making an impression, but avoiding the trap-falls of looking like a teacher. After eating a light dinner, he dressed in black pants and a cream-colored sweater with a copper brown wool winter coat that fell to his mid-thigh. They weren\u2019t going to a club; Jimin couldn\u2019t use pure sex appeal to win Jeongguk over, which meant that looking handsome was going to have to be his angle. He carefully fixed his black hair in the mirror, and as he was scolding a stray hair into place, his phone buzzed.\n\n\n\n\n\nJEON JEONGGUK [06:59:35PM]\n\n\n\nI\u2019m downstairs. Hope you\u2019re wearing boots, and no long coats!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGod damn it,\u201d Jimin cursed, shrugging out of his wool coat and swapping it for a black puffer jacket that he loved dearly. The long coat would have looked elegant for ice skating, but Jimin supposed he had to follow whatever Jeongguk was saying at this point.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nmood: \u201cSTUD\u201d by troye sivan\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe moment Jimin exited his building, Jeongguk\u2019s text message made complete sense. Because there was Jeongguk, wearing black pinstripe pants and a black turtleneck with a black coat, and he was leaning against his Kawasaki, holding one helmet with the other propped on the seat.\n\n\n\u201cBet you changed your coat,\u201d he guessed the moment he saw Jimin, grinning.\n\n\n\u201cI was going to look \n\nso \n\nhigh-fashion until you sent that text,\u201d Jimin sighed, and Jeongguk snickered, ducking his head for a moment. His eyes drank Jimin in from head to toe, and Jimin noticed, his heart stuttering.\n\n\n\u201cYou still look great,\u201d Jeongguk complimented. \u201cHere.\u201d He handed over the helmet that was propped on the seat. \u201cIt\u2019s been sanitized, don\u2019t worry. You up for a ride? I\u2019m trying to show off. Humor me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d Jimin accepted the helmet. \u201cUp for my first time riding? With you? To feed your ego? Sure.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll assume you mean the motorcycle,\u201d Jeongguk replied, twirling his helmet between his palms and jamming it onto his head. He flipped the visor up. \u201cGive me at \n\nleast \n\na few hours before we take it any further.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Jimin flatly said, and Jeongguk\u2019s grin reached his eyes. Jimin slipped the helmet on, and Jeongguk\u2019s hands were suddenly on his head, like he was making sure Jimin\u2019s helmet was on properly.\n\n\n\u201cCool. On the back, then,\u201d Jeongguk said, swinging one leg over and turning to pat the second little seat. \u201cI\u2019ll need you to hold on tight to me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re loving this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Jimin asked, also swinging his leg high enough to hop onto the back of the Kawasaki, balancing himself.\n\n\n\u201cWhat, having a beautiful man holding onto me on \n\nmy \n\nmotorcycle? I mean, I can\u2019t complain,\u201d Jeongguk said, starting the engine as Jimin\u2019s heart kickstarted at the same. He took a deep breath, and then he carefully wrapped his arms around Jeongguk\u2019s waist, his hands flat. The moment he did, he scoffed, leaned back, and used the top of his hand to playfully whack Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder. Jeongguk let out a hum, confused.\n\n\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me? I should\u2019ve known,\u201d Jimin complained jokingly.\n\n\n\u201cMeaning what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMeaning I hold onto you for \n\ntwo seconds \n\nand all I feel are abs and muscle,\u201d Jimin stated, and Jeongguk burst out laughing. \u201cJesus, this whole \u2018personal trainer with a motorcycle\u2019 thing is really pushing it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know whether I should feel proud or insulted, But hold on regardless,\u201d Jeongguk said with laughter in his voice. Jimin had half a mind to glance up at the stars and thank the universe for such a gift, but he refrained and wrapped his arms around Jeongguk\u2019s waist again, holding on tightly. Jeongguk revved the engine, and then he lifted both of his feet and took off down the narrow street.\n\n\nThe adrenaline rush was instantaneous. Jimin had never ridden on a motorcycle before, and now he couldn\u2019t figure out why. It was immediately thrilling, the way that Jeongguk careened through the streets with such ease, the way they leaned whenever he took a turn, the way Jeongguk rested one gloved hand on his thigh when they were at a red light, the way that that same hand came up to rest on top of Jimin\u2019s hands for just a brief moment before he took off again. It made Jimin absolutely weak, and he considered himself fortunate that the ride to the park was only about twelve minutes.\n\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d Jeongguk cut the engine, both feet on the ground, and Jimin removed his arms, his heart still racing. \u201cWhat\u2019d you think of your first ride?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was\u2026\u201d Jimin removed his helmet as Jeongguk hopped off, and he offered one hand to Jimin. Jimin accepted and slipped off the little seat on the back, chuckling. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t even bullshit you. That was an adrenaline rush. I loved it.\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk pulled off his helmet, rested it against his hip under one arm, and ran his fingers through his hair as Jimin stared, trying to come to terms with the fact that Jeongguk was the perfect man, the whole package. Maybe he had some faults and flaws, but Jimin had yet to discover any, and it was both maddening and devastatingly sexy. Jeongguk seemed to have confidence without arrogance, which was an achievement in and of itself.\n\n\n\u201cWell, then I\u2019m glad I took a chance and didn\u2019t show up in my car. Pretty sure Dasom left some toys in it,\u201d he said mostly to himself, and Jimin snickered. \u201cSo, ice skating? What\u2019s the motive?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI used to ice skate when I was younger,\u201d Jimin replied, and Jeongguk hummed, turning towards the park. The lighting was fluorescent, but there were also twinkle lights, and the ice skating rink in the middle of the park was bustling with happy patrons. \u201cLook, I thought about just saying \u2018fuck it\u2019\u00a0 and suggesting a nightclub, but you have a kid to pick up in the morning, so I wasn\u2019t really sure how you felt about that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCreative \n\nand \n\nconsiderate,\u201d Jeongguk teased as they slowly began to walk. \u201cYou\u2019re ticking all the boxes. But I\u2019ll politely ask if you\u2019ll let me pay the fee for two people to skate.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m politely asking if I can argue.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll allow one counterargument,\u201d Jeongguk replied, and Jimin pressed his tongue into his cheek to keep from laughing. \u201cBut I\u2019ll likely pretend I can\u2019t hear you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m older than you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo, how was your Seollal?\u201d Jeongguk asked, and Jimin burst out laughing, shaking his head as they approached the ice skating rink, upbeat music playing through the speakers. \u201cYou\u2019re older than me, sure, but I think I can pay forty-thousand won for two of us to skate. It won\u2019t break the bank. Hi, two tickets please, and skates to rent.\u201d\n\n\nJimin clamped his mouth shut as Jeongguk approached the woman dressed warmly at the booth by the entrance, and he paid in cash. They walked through together to where rental skates were being sanitized and handed out according to size, and they both grabbed a pair of ice skates and sat down on the bench beside one another.\n\n\n\u201cAre you about to do a triple axel and make me look like a fool?\u201d Jeongguk wondered. \u201cBecause I can skate, but on two feet only.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo triple axels. Those are a thing of the past,\u201d Jimin said as he laced up his skates. \u201cDid you take ice skating lessons as a kid, too?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, no. Nothing like that.\u201d Jeongguk hesitated for a moment, wiggling his left foot into the ice skate, and then he sighed. \u201cNot to bring up my kid on a date, but I learned the basics of the sport because Dasom started ice skating about a year ago. She\u2019s really into it. Ice skating and the violin. Those are her two things. And then she wants to learn how to do proper weightlifting and boxing, so she\u2019s a little\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s awesome,\u201d Jimin filled in, and he didn\u2019t miss the single dimple in Jeongguk\u2019s cheek as he fought back a smile, lacing up his skate. \u201cYou can talk about her. She\u2019s your daughter. It doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan I just lay it all on the table here, then? Before we go ice skating?\u201d Jeongguk asked, resting his elbows on his knees, and Jimin nodded. \u201cThe only reason I felt okay with dropping my number in my kid\u2019s card is because you know that she exists. Dasom. You know I\u2019m a dad. You know I have a daughter.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not something I usually tell people until the second or third date,\u201d Jeongguk said with a short laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s typically a dealbreaker for most men, point-blank. And the women I\u2019ve dated have pretended to be okay with it, but then they remember that I had to have sex with another woman to actually have a kid, and \n\nthen\n\n it\u2019s a dealbreaker, especially because Dasom stilll sees her mother. So it\u2019s\u2026 yeah. It gets complicated. But you already know about her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd you like her.\u201d\n\n\nJimin let out a breathy laugh, surprised at how vulnerable Jeongguk was making himself despite all of his previous bravado. Surely it would return, but he had said he was laying his cards on the table, and Jimin could see it in spades. He couldn\u2019t begin to imagine the struggle of being a single father trying to date, but Jeongguk had a point. Even though Namjoon and Taehyung had brought it up, Jimin wasn\u2019t bothered by the idea that Jeongguk had a daughter.\n\n\n\u201cI do like her. So it\u2019s not something you have to worry about,\u201d Jimin replied. \u201cYou can just\u2026 you know. You can be yourself. I\u2019ll try to do the same. Not easy when I\u2019m usually in teacher mode, but if we both break the habit now, we might have some luck.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDeal. Alright, that was serious enough.\u201d Jeongguk steadied himself and stood up on the rubber floor, and Jimin did the same, grinning. \u201cShow an amateur how it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\n\nJimin stepped onto the ice first, and he pushed off from the wall and glided away, slowly turning as if his legs were a compass and facing the entrance. Jeongguk stepped onto the ice gingerly, but then he pushed off as well, catching up with Jimin. Jimin was going to ask if Jeongguk wanted to skate with him, but Jeongguk just took off without him, rounding the corner and grinning mischievously. Rolling his eyes, Jimin turned and cut through the center of the rink sneakily, and then he found a spot right in front of Jeongguk in his path and began to slowly weave his feet in and out, skating backwards.\n\n\n\u201cImpressive,\u201d Jeongguk commended. \u201cAnd also grossly unfair, since I can only move forwards.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat, you can\u2019t go backwards yet?\u201d Jimin teased.\n\n\n\u201cNot unless you want me on my ass the entire time,\u201d Jeongguk said, and Jimin snickered. As Jeongguk continued to skate facing forward, Jimin continued backwards, coming up to Jeongguk\u2019s left side and skating with him in little crossover steps. \u201cYou really picked a difficult environment, you know that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh? Why\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSharp blades on ice with the potential to wipe out epically,\u201d Jeongguk declared, and as Jimin laughed, he added, \u201cand you think I\u2019m going to be able to give you my best game like this? Goddamn. Serious disadvantage.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat, you can flirt on a motorcycle but not on the ice?\u201d Jimin asked, pressing Jeongguk for more. Instead of answering, Jeongguk suddenly wrapped one arm around Jimin\u2019s waist and spun the two of them away from the outer perimeter. Jimin clutched Jeongguk\u2019s arm \n\n(his damn muscular bicep, Jesus Christ) \n\nand steadied himself, and then he found himself in a strange sort of dance position, realizing that Jeongguk could wrap an entire arm around his waist with ease.\n\n\n\u201cI can if you give me a little time,\u201d Jeongguk quietly said, his eyes flicking down to Jimin\u2019s lips for a fleeting moment before his gaze met Jimin\u2019s again. \u201cBit different from dancing up on you at a nightclub and asking for your name, but I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI like this better,\u201d Jimin almost whispered. Jeongguk dragged his bottom lip through his teeth, and then he began to slowly skate away, checking if Jimin was following. So Jimin fell right into step alongside Jeongguk, nudging him as they rounded the corner.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you some questions. About yourself. Answer what you feel comfortable with. I\u2019ll answer whatever questions you answer,\u201d Jimin said, and Jeongguk hummed in interest, arching one perfect eyebrow. \u201cWhen\u2019s your birthday?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSeptember first.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOctober thirteenth. Did you go to school?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI did. Studied exercise science. Graduated a few months before Dasom was born,\u201d Jeongguk replied. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you went to school to study education, seeing as you taught my child.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m winging it,\u201d Jimin joked flatly, and Jeongguk snickered. \u201cWhat\u2019s your worst habit?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm\u2026 starting things and not finishing them,\u201d Jeongguk replied after a moment of thought. \u201cIf I\u2019m not immediately good at it, I tend to give up. Shitty habit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPretty normal, though,\u201d Jimin agreed, gliding around another corner. \u201cI get too dramatic in fights with people and tend to take it too far. Where were you born?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBusan.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBusan,\u201d Jimin echoed, and Jeongguk whipped his head sideways to give Jimin a look of pleased surprise. \u201cWho\u2019s the fashion designer you always tag in your Instagram posts? Friend of yours?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBest friend, in fact. Half of Dasom\u2019s closet is just custom clothing he made for her like she\u2019s his personal doll. Happy to know you\u2019ve been looking me up on social media,\u201d Jeongguk said, and Jimin scoffed, trying to play it off, but Jeongguk was highly amused. \u201cFind anything interesting?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust a shit ton of shirtless workout videos and photos.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my brand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat, thirst trapping?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPersonal \n\ntraining, \n\nget your mind out of the gutter,\u201d Jeongguk retorted playfully. \u201cUnless you felt trapped after looking at my feed, in which case, I\u2019d love to know more. Get some feedback. Good for business.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know how hot you are,\u201d Jimin said in irritation, and Jeongguk\u2019s close-lipped smile with his eyebrows raised was a clear attempt to keep from laughing. \u201cYou don\u2019t need any feedback, trust me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy turn,\u201d Jeongguk suddenly interrupted, and Jimin raised his eyebrows this time. \u201cBecause you\u2019re asking all the normal questions, but now that I know you\u2019re looking me up on Instagram, let\u2019s rip the Band-Aid off.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis feels like a trap.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA thirst trap? I\u2019m fully clothed,\u201d Jeongguk said innocently, sweeping a hand up and down his body.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAnd if I feel like seeing you \n\nnot \n\nfully clothed?\u201d Jimin asked without a filter, finally feeling like he was getting the hang of things, and Jeongguk smirked.\n\n\n\u201cAlways an option. Now it\u2019s time for the awkward questions.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Jimin spun and began to skate backwards, facing Jeongguk. \u201cShoot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLast time you got laid?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago,\u201d Jimin said without hesitation.\n\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t have asked that,\u201d Jeongguk sighed, and Jimin stifled a laugh. \u201cThree months ago. When did you lose your virginity? What age?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNineteen. Some hot guy in a nightclub let me fuck him in a bathroom,\u201d Jimin said shamelessly, and Jeongguk snorted, almost falling over.\n\n\n\u201cSounds less chaotic than mine,\u201d he said, and Jimin glided backwards around the next corner, looking at Jeongguk curiously. Jeongguk laughed as he spoke. \u201cNo, it was disastrous. Karaoke night. I had just turned nineteen and I was a horny mess. I gave this guy a blowjob in the bathroom, and then I took some girl to a backroom to have sex. I never even knew their names.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe true bisexual experience,\u201d Jimin teased, and Jeongguk shrugged, grinning. \u201cYou know, this is like a really shitty game of Never Have I Ever.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust fishing for information without the benefit of alcohol,\u201d Jeongguk said, eyes sparkling.\n\n\n\u201cYeah? Trying to see how far you can take this?\u201d Jimin asked, turning forwards again and slowing down so Jeongguk could skate beside him.\n\n\n\u201cYou said it, not me,\u201d Jeongguk pointed out, and then he skated a little further ahead, forcing Jimin to catch up quickly. \u201cDating is fucking weird when you get older. It\u2019s easier, but at the same time, it\u2019s fucking impossible.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEasier because you have absolutely no shame, fucking impossible because you\u2019re more set in your ways,\u201d Jimin deduced, and Jeongguk smacked his thigh, snapped his fingers, and point at Jimin.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly it,\u201d he declared. \u201cSee? You get it. Now teach me how to skate backwards so I can show off to Dasom next time she makes me get on the ice with her.\u201d\n\n\nJimin agreed and began to show Jeongguk a few basic techniques that would help him get comfortable with skating backwards, including the waves he was doing earlier and how to push with the edge of his blade to direct himself. The more that they skated together, though, the more they gravitated towards one another. Suddenly, Jimin was setting his hands on Jeongguk\u2019s hips, and Jeongguk was dragging his long fingers across Jimin\u2019s shoulder blades as they moved together. Closer and closer. The thin boundary line melted as if they weren\u2019t already skating on thin ice. Jimin wasn\u2019t used to purposefully flirty touches, but it made him feel like a teenager again, his pulse racing every time they danced around one another.\n\n\n\u201cShould we get going?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHmm? Oh. Shit, it\u2019s past nine,\u201d Jeongguk realized, glancing over at the clocktower on the opposite side of the rink. \u201cSurprised they haven\u2019t caught us yet. We only purchased two hours.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe rink closes at ten,\u201d Jimin pointed out, and Jeongguk snickered.\n\n\n\u201cMakes sense. Alright, let\u2019s get out of here. Guess that\u2019s a wrap on date night.\u201d\n\n\nIt was a quick process to return the skates and step back into boots, and the first two minutes of walking towards the parking lot felt awkwardly strange in comparison to hours they had just spent fooling around on the ice. Jeongguk offered Jimin the second helmet, and they both hopped onto the motorcycle, Jimin automatically wrapping his arms around Jeongguk\u2019s waist in a secure fashion. Jeongguk started the ignition and then took off onto the main road, Jimin glancing over Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder every now and again. When they stopped at a red light, Jimin\u2019s heart leapt into his throat when Jeongguk\u2019s gloved hand came to rest on top of the hand Jimin had on Jeongguk\u2019s waist. He laced their fingers together for a moment, and then he returned the hand to the handlebars as the light turned green.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re overthinking it. It\u2019s not a big deal. You\u2019ve been on dates. It\u2019s just been awhile since you were this desperate to get laid by your date. Jesus, do I even care how it happens? No. I\u2019d give anything to see him on his knees for me, but I think I\u2019m more in the mood for him to fuck me into the next century.\n\n\n\nJimin hated how quickly they arrived at his apartment building. He hated even more when he had to hand over the motorcycle helmet. But it was Jeongguk\u2019s sudden hesitation to say goodbye that made a flicker of hope and adrenaline spark in Jimin\u2019s body.\n\n\n\u201cSo.\u201d Jeongguk set the extra helmet onto the seat. \u201cHow, uh\u2026 how willing would you be to do this again sometime?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, come on.\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice was hushed, but he wasn\u2019t stupid. All that talk earlier at the ice skating rink and no follow-through? There was no way. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you want this night to end right here, right now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be a gentleman,\u201d Jeongguk replied, which only egged Jimin on.\n\n\n\u201cYou were plenty polite for the past three hours. Figured the date was just a formality. Just two adults being responsible,\u201d Jimin said, and Jeongguk smirked, trying not to laugh as he ran his fingers through his short hair.\n\n\n\u201cAt what point did you catch on that I was interested?\u201d he asked impishly, and Jimin snorted.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. At what point did you catch on that I was asking to see you naked?\u201d he fired back, and Jeongguk stifled a laugh. \u201cSo? Are you coming up or not? A gentleman would at \n\nleast \n\nsee me to my front door.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I \n\nam \n\na gentleman.\u201d\n\n\nSo Jeongguk grabbed both helmets for safe keeping, and Jimin, with his heart beating louder than his footsteps, led the way into the building and up to the third floor. His apartment was on the corner, and the hallways were quiet. Jimin punched in his code and shoved open the door, and then he held it open and glanced at Jeongguk expectantly.\n\n\n\u201cChoice is yours,\u201d he offered. Jeongguk bit his bottom lip momentarily, but then he stepped inside, and as the door closed, Jimin took both of the motorcycle helmets and set them onto his kitchen counter. Then he took a deep breath, palms pressed to the cool surface, and collected his courage. He had as good as asked for it, and now he had Jeongguk alone in his apartment.\n\n\n\u201cAre you saying goodnight, or are\u2026\u201d Jimin trailed off as he spun around, because Jeongguk swooped in and grabbed Jimin by the waist, and Jimin held onto him instinctively, noticing within seconds how easily they melted into each other, as if they had spent the past few hours studying one another and all the ways they could fit together.\n\n\n\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d Jeongguk whispered, etching the words on Jimin\u2019s cheek as his lips grazed smooth skin. Jimin\u2019s head lolled slightly, because damn it, this was what he had been waiting for all night.\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered, and then Jeongguk\u2019s lips found their way to Jimin\u2019s without a moment\u2019s hesitation.\n\n\nJimin could only wonder if Jeongguk was immediately saving all the details of the kiss to memory as well\u2014the little breath they both took before diving in. Soft, careful, curious with a touch of confidence, like both of them had known that it was bound to happen. Jimin tended to filter out moments like this with his partners, seeing the first kiss as a formality, something to get out of the way before stripping down to the bare minimum in a literal and figurative fashion. This kiss, though, was not something he wanted to erase from his memory.\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t surprising to Jimin that Jeongguk\u2019s lips were soft and that he kissed just like he smiled\u2014dazzling. And when Jeongguk pulled away, there was a moment where they both searched each other\u2019s eyes, read facial expressions, communicated telepathically. \n\nHow far do we take this? Do you want this the way I do?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d was all Jimin was able to breathe out before Jeongguk crashed into him again, all dazzling softness forgotten, replaced with a confidence that made Jimin gasp. Jeongguk\u2019s hand gripped the back of Jimin\u2019s neck, fingertips pressing into hair, and when his tongue swept along Jimin\u2019s bottom lip, Jimin wrapped his arms around Jeongguk\u2019s neck, body arching towards Jeongguk naturally. It was the perfect storm of experience and eagerness, the way they kissed while pressed to the door as if they couldn\u2019t bear the thought of separating to make a decision on what happened next.\n\n\n\u201cJesus, you\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d Jeongguk whispered against Jimin\u2019s neck, two hands shoving Jimin\u2019s jacket off his shoulders and onto the floor. Jimin tugged until Jeongguk\u2019s shirt was untucked, and then he slipped his hands underneath, fingers latching into warm skin and fluttering across every single curve and valley of Jeongguk\u2019s body, all the muscle tone, the way his waist was small enough to make Jimin dizzy.\n\n\n\u201cYou said I could see you without clothes on,\u201d Jimin said. \u201cSo get to it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in no hurry,\u201d Jeongguk said, and then he threaded his fingers through Jimin\u2019s hair and tugged until Jimin\u2019s head was against the door, chin up. In total control. Cool, calm, collected. What was it about Jeongguk that made Jimin just want to give in? He usually had to do so much work, but here was Jeongguk, taking his time. With his lips on the column of Jimin\u2019s neck, Jeongguk added, \u201cI want to give you exactly what you deserve.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d Jimin asked, his knees weak as he hooked his fingers in Jeongguk\u2019s belt loops, feeling lightheaded with pleasure already.\n\n\n\u201cWell, if you let me\u2026\u201d Jeongguk dragged his lips around the front of Jimin\u2019s neck along his Adam\u2019s Apple and to the other side as Jimin damn near choked. \u201cMy plan was to fuck you so well that you\u2019ll never be able to say anyone else\u2019s name in bed except mine.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ambitious,\u201d Jimin whispered, even though he was trembling at the mere thought. \n\nNo, pull it together. No man can fuck you that well. Let him talk his shit. Just focus.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnless you\u2019d prefer to top,\u201d Jeongguk murmured. \u201cOr we can save that for a rainy day.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou plan on getting me into bed more than once?\u201d Jimin asked, shivering inwardly when Jeongguk\u2019s hand grabbed underneath his thigh to hitch his leg up. The unabashed \n\nconfidence. \n\nJimin had no idea what to do with himself. \u201cHaven\u2019t even undressed me yet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI told you.\u201d Jeongguk dove in for another kiss, one large hand still holding Jimin\u2019s leg up, their hips pressed together. \u201cI\u2019m not rushing this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou talk to all your partners like this?\u201d Jimin asked, hating the way that he loved every word Jeongguk was saying.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Jeongguk pressed his forehead to Jimin\u2019s. \u201cBut I want to absolutely ruin you. The kind of sex that makes you cry from how good it feels. If you don\u2019t believe me, then you have nothing to lose.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDeal. Bedroom.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nmood: \u201cnaked\u201d by doja cat\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere was no need for further conversation. Jeongguk was right\u2014Jimin had nothing to lose. If the sex was good, then at minimum, Jimin got laid. If it was \n\nmore \n\nthan good\u2026 Jimin wasn\u2019t quite ready to consider that yet. Instead, he guided Jeongguk to his bedroom as they kissed feverishly, chasing one another\u2019s lips, fumbling out of sheer adrenaline. This was what Jimin loved most about falling into bed with men after thirty. There was a sort of assured intimacy that came with it, and there was a lack of shame from being aroused. Jimin surely wasn\u2019t fighting it.\n\n\nJimin turned so that Jeongguk fell onto the bed first on his back, and then he knelt at the foot of the bed between Jeongguk\u2019s legs. He had to give a show of confidence as well, because he was no amateur. If Jeongguk was intent on having sex good enough to make either or both of them cry, then there was no time to lose, despite Jeongguk\u2019s statement that he was in no real hurry.\n\n\n\u201cUndress for me,\u201d Jeongguk requested, and Jimin swallowed down the little shudder of pleasure that threatened his body. He crossed his arms at his waist and pulled off his sweater, tossing it aside, and then he got rid of his belt. Jeongguk just sat up with his hands propped on the bed behind him, watching Jimin\u2019s every move, his eyes wandering up and down Jimin\u2019s chest. The way he devoured Jimin with his eyes made Jimin feel a surge of unfiltered confidence.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen Jimin began to remove his pants, he almost stumbled, because Jeongguk was undressing, too, and it was quite a show. He pulled his shirt off and threw it to the floor somewhere, and then he ran his fingers through his hair and sat back again as Jimin stared, his pants kicked off now. Jeongguk on video was a sight to behold, but Jeongguk in person was an entirely different story. His entire upper body was sculpted with muscle, but not in an overbearing fashion. It suited him perfectly, and the tattoos were complementary in a deadly sort of way. Two sleeves full of flowers, hands intertwined, some butterflies, ticking clocks and winding staircases, a tiger, scattered words here and there. Picture perfect.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d Jimin said mostly to himself, and Jeongguk smirked, but not in a cocky way. He was \n\npleased, \n\nthrilled by Jimin\u2019s reaction. And when he lifted one finger and crooked it a few times without a word, Jimin reevaluated his previous desire to have Jeongguk on his knees. Now it was Jimin who was ready to drop to his knees and give Jeongguk whatever he wanted.\n\n\n\u201cKnew you\u2019d be this beautiful. Knew it from the second I saw you,\u201d Jeongguk whispered as Jimin climbed onto his lap in nothing more than his boxer briefs, Jeongguk still wearing pants but shirtless. Shameless, Jimin situated himself perfectly, and he could feel how hard Jeongguk was, but Jeongguk didn\u2019t react like most men Jimin had bedded. He didn\u2019t gasp or throw his head back or grab Jimin for a rough kiss. He just slipped both of his hands onto Jimin\u2019s ass and encouraged Jimin to grind down on him, his lips dragging across Jimin\u2019s chest.\n\n\n\u201cJeongguk,\u201d Jimin breathed, eyes closed as he rocked his hips. \u201cGet undressed. Hurry up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm, hold on. Not yet,\u201d Jeongguk murmured, and then he rolled and flipped them over so that Jimin was lying on his back. Jeongguk grabbed both of Jimin\u2019s arms and carefully but firmly held them over Jimin\u2019s head against the mattress, diving down to leave bruising kisses along Jimin\u2019s neck and collarbone. Jimin squirmed, bringing his legs to wrap around Jeongguk\u2019s waist in an attempt to bring them closer together.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d was all Jimin could manage. Jeongguk\u2019s hands released his arms, but Jimin kept them above his head, eyes rolling back as Jeongguk began to kiss down his body. His hands grabbed Jimin\u2019s knees for leverage, and he trailed fire down the center of Jimin\u2019s chest with his lips, pausing to run his tongue over each nipple before continuing down to Jimin\u2019s hips and thighs.\n\n\n\u201cStop playing with your food before you eat it,\u201d Jimin said breathlessly, back arching off the bed when Jeongguk sucked the skin of his inner thigh, his cock twitching in anticipation. Jimin felt the vibration of Jeongguk\u2019s laugh course through his veins when Jeongguk\u2019s lips were on his stomach.\n\n\n\u201cSaying that means that you think I\u2019m going to eat you alive,\u201d he muttered, and Jimin\u2019s laugh was breathy as he finally opened his eyes. Jeongguk stood up and removed his belt, and then he stepped out of his pants, never once breaking eye contact with Jimin.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh, Jesus Christ,\u201d Jimin moaned, and Jeongguk\u2019s playful smirk was the cherry on top. Broad shoulders, toned chest and abdomen, small waist, muscular thighs. This man was walking sex, and he was intent on fucking Jimin until Jimin cried, whether he could accomplish such a feat or not. \u201cCome here. Let me at least suck you off.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Jeongguk asked, and Jimin nodded. \u201cLie down on your back. Head at the edge of the bed. If you don\u2019t like that, then tell me now. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\n\nNegotiations were also a different game. At thirty-two, Jimin knew exactly what he liked and what he didn\u2019t like, exactly what he wanted and what he always avoided. But lying on his back so Jeongguk could fuck his throat was absolutely something that he both liked \n\nand \n\nwanted. Jimin fell onto his back, head off the edge of the bed, and Jeongguk stood over him with a small smile, pupils blown. He then leaned forward, thumbs hooking into the waistband of Jimin\u2019s briefs.\n\n\n\u201cMay I?\u201d he whispered, and then he kissed Jimin upside down. \u201cWant you naked while you do this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jimin whispered, and he lifted his hips so that Jeongguk could remove his briefs and throw them aside. When his hands glided up Jimin\u2019s thighs and hips to his ribs and his chest, Jimin closed his eyes again, skin igniting with every touch, every fingertip like a separate match to spark the blazing fire between the two of them. Jeongguk\u2019s hand gripped Jimin\u2019s jaw. Heavy breathing versus composed breathing. A firm kiss with swallowed moans. All of Jimin\u2019s desires melted like sugar on Jeongguk\u2019s tongue as they kissed.\n\n\n\u201cOpen,\u201d Jeongguk said, and Jimin opened his eyes and his mouth, unable to believe how compliant he was for this man. Was he really that fucked already? Or had it been \n\nthat \n\nlong since he had been so magnetically attracted to someone?\n\n\n\nApparently so. If I call him \u201cdaddy,\u201d he\u2019ll kill me. I\u2019m tempted. \n\nJimin circled his tongue around the head of Jeongguk\u2019s cock and then tilted his head back more, a clear sign for Jeongguk to take it further. Jeongguk thrusted gently, and Jimin gagged once, but he relaxed his throat and breathed through his nose, stunned when Jeongguk hit the back of his throat.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCan you take it?\u201d Jeongguk asked, and it wasn\u2019t a taunt; it was a genuine question. Jimin hummed positively, so Jeongguk\u2019s hands came to either side of Jimin\u2019s head, and he began to fuck into Jimin\u2019s mouth in a rhythm. Jimin stifled a moan and gripped his sheets, trying not to touch himself, tightening his lips. Jeongguk kept one hand cradled underneath Jimin\u2019s head and used his thumb to stroke Jimin\u2019s cheek as he continued to thrust, and it was single-handedly the hottest gesture Jimin had ever experienced.\n\n\n\u201cFeels fucking incredible,\u201d Jeongguk praised, his fingers flutter down Jimin\u2019s neck to his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing, taking it so well, look at you\u2014shit, okay. Okay, that\u2019s enough. I\u2019m not coming down your throat. Not now.\u201d\n\n\nJimin let out a sigh when Jeongguk pulled out, and he immediately rolled onto his stomach, wincing from the sensitivity of his hard cock against the sheets. He was going to roll back over, but Jeongguk climbed onto the bed and pressed his hand to Jimin\u2019s lower back.\n\n\n\u201cStay here.\u201d\n\n\nJimin stayed, and he didn\u2019t regret it for a single moment. He directed Jeongguk to the lube and condoms, and Jeongguk retrieved both. He lubed up his fingers, and then he spread Jimin and put a pillow under Jimin\u2019s hips, slipping one finger in. Jimin sucked him right up with a small moan, but Jeongguk just trailed kisses down Jimin\u2019s shoulder blades, fucking him open quickly but efficiently. One finger became two, and the way he angled his long fingers had Jimin writhing.\n\n\n\u201cFuck, \n\nfuck, \n\nwhat are you\u2014? Ah, ah, ah, \n\nJeongguk, \n\nJeongguk,\u201d Jimin panted, pulling at the sheets with white knuckles, having half a mind to thrash around. Jeongguk seemed to know exactly what he was doing, because his fingers were repeatedly stroking the same spot, and Jimin\u2019s vision was doubling, breath quickening, muscles clenching in anticipation, mind working on overdrive. But Jeongguk was holding him down without being demanding about it, and Jimin was letting him do it, gasping in pleasure.\n\n\n\u201cRight there, hmm?\u201d he finally said when Jimin was gritting his teeth and moaning into his arm, lifting his hips, eyes squeezed shut. \u201cThink I can find that same spot when I\u2019m fucking you? Should we take bets?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up and fuck me,\u201d Jimin gasped as Jeongguk\u2019s fingers slipped out of him. With one hand, Jeongguk nudged Jimin until Jimin rolled over, his lower back and hips still on the pillow. Jeongguk kept him right there, kneeling on the bed as he rolled the condom on and added a bit of extra lube. Jimin hadn\u2019t once touched himself yet, and he couldn\u2019t even remember why. It didn\u2019t matter.\n\n\n\u201cLegs open,\u201d Jeongguk commanded, and Jimin had a thousand jokes and wanted to laugh, but he had no time. The confidence he had had going into this endeavor had been grossly misplaced, thinking that he was going to be in complete control and that Jeongguk would absolutely \n\nnot \n\nbe able to bring him to the point of begging. But now Jimin was eating his own words, because he was doing everything Jeongguk said without question.\n\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Jimin gasped out as Jeongguk slowly pushed into him. He thrusted shallowly, one hand massaging Jimin\u2019s thigh, and then he pushed in further as his slicked up hand wrapped around Jimin\u2019s cock for the first time. Jimin swore he saw stars in his vision, clenching helplessly around Jeongguk, not sure if he was going to make it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou can take me. Just relax. A little more.\u201d Jeongguk leaned forward to whisper in Jimin\u2019s ear as Jimin\u2019s chest heaved. Sex was just a recreational activity to him, mutual pleasure with a fair bit of awkward fumbling, a good way to grab at fleeting intimacy for satisfaction. But Jeongguk was a walking clich\u00e9, turning sex into something much more dangerous than just a pastime.\n\n\n\u201cYou made several promises,\u201d Jimin breathlessly said when Jeongguk finally bottomed out. \u201cAnd we\u2019re basically fucking in a missionary position. Hope you\u2019re not all talk. Better walk the walk.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou say \u2018missionary position\u2019 like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d Jeongguk slowly cocked his head, staring down at Jimin, his muscles flexing as he hovered. \u201cYou must have had some shitty sexual experiences in this position if you think it\u2019s boring.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMust have.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it,\u201d Jimin said, and he knew he was going to regret it. Jeongguk kissed him once, and then he sat up, kneeling between Jimin\u2019s legs, his hands on the backs of Jimin\u2019s thighs. He pulled out nearly all the way before thrusting back into Jimin with a single snap of his hips, and it knocked the air out of Jimin\u2019s lungs for a moment. Jeongguk leaned forward again.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t break promises.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nmood: \u201cfall over\u201d by banks\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis whisper lingered, but Jimin\u2019s moans drowned it out. Jeongguk began to fuck into Jimin deeply, steadily, at the perfect angle for Jimin to feel \n\neverything. \n\nJeongguk\u2019s hand was stroking Jimin in perfect time with his thrusts, and he wasn\u2019t relenting or slowing down. Jimin wanted to do something, wanted to participate, but he couldn\u2019t think straight. Jeongguk shifted and angled his hips as he resituated Jimin, and the moment he started fucking into Jimin again, Jimin damn near lost it, his own hand flying to his cock.\n\n\n\n\u201cAh, \n\nfuck! Fuck, oh my God, \n\nfuck, \n\nJeongguk, please, please, please, \n\nplease, \n\nI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t,\u201d Jimin babbled, because every single thrust was dead-on in the perfect spot right up against his prostate, and he was starting to leak pre-come all over his stomach, making a sticky mess.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNot stopping unless you tell me,\u201d Jeongguk said, watching Jimin intently, his hands still gripping Jimin\u2019s thighs like he was determined to leave his mark. Jimin didn\u2019t stop him. He went absolutely silent, his hand not doing any of the work, eyes rolling back in his head, his body so overwhelmed that he swore he could hear screaming. Or was that just him? He was sweating now, writhing against the sheets like he was trying to get away from Jeongguk but wanting the exact opposite.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby, come on. Nice and loud. You need to come?\u201d Jeongguk asked.\n\n\n\u201cAh, \n\nah,\u201d \n\nJimin gasped, nodding frantically. He was close, so close, and the way his body was tensing was a clear sign. But the moment he started panting and lifting his hips, Jeongguk suddenly stopped fucking him. Jimin clenched around him repeatedly, eyes shooting open.\n\n\n\u201cYou good?\u201d Jeongguk whispered, leaning down to gently kiss down Jimin\u2019s neck. Jimin moaned.\n\n\n\u201cWhy did you stop?\u201d he asked, desperate. Jeongguk chuckled.\n\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t want you to come too quickly. It\u2019ll feel fucking amazing if you have to work for it,\u201d Jeongguk whispered, and Jimin shivered, swallowing heavily. \u201cYou like missionary now?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot bad.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a liar,\u201d Jeongguk laughed, and then he slipped his arms underneath Jimin\u2019s back and lifted him right off the bed, still inside him. Jimin gritted his teeth, but then he found himself sitting in Jeongguk\u2019s lap, which sent Jeongguk\u2019s cock even deeper inside him, and he let out a slow, breathy moan, dropping his forehead onto Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder, fingernails digging into tattooed arms.\n\n\n\u201cSound so beautiful. Look at you. I wish you could see yourself,\u201d Jeongguk whispered, his hand slipping between the two of them. He began to stroke Jimin slowly with just the right amount of pressure, thumb swiping over the head of Jimin\u2019s cock as Jimin rocked his hips. Jeongguk was, indeed, not in a rush. He seemed absolutely hellbound on pleasuring Jimin for as long as possible, dragging it out for as long as Jimin could withstand it.\n\n\n\u201cT-Tell me you\u2026 you feel\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m not enjoying this?\u201d Jeongguk whispered, flicking his wrist and making Jimin shudder. \u201cWish I could film you like this. Watch it back. Let you see yourself how I\u2019m seeing you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck, Jeongguk,\u201d Jimin breathed, still circling his hips as little sparks of pleasure coursed through his body in languid, consistent waves, the arousal so all-consuming that he felt like he was floating. Jeongguk kissed Jimin\u2019s shoulder quietly, his hand speeding up, and Jimin gripped Jeongguk\u2019s biceps tightly, jaw clenched, panting as he tried to fuck himself to get what he wanted, so \n\nclose.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYou close?\u201d Jeongguk whispered, and Jimin frantically nodded. \u201cFeel good?\u201d Jimin nodded again. \u201cGonna come? Hmm.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFuck, \n\nwhat the fuck?\u201d Jimin gasped out, his entire body collapsing in a near boneless state when Jeongguk\u2019s hand suddenly vanished, the orgasm brought to a dead stop right on the spot. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking kidding me, you\u2019re kidding me. I\u2019m gonna kill you, I can\u2019t \n\ndo this, \n\nwill you just\u2014?\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk shut him up with a kiss, and then he laid Jimin back onto the pillows, still hard inside Jimin.\n\n\n\u201cYou share this wall with any neighbors?\u201d Jeongguk asked, and Jimin let out a laugh of disbelief, staring at his ceiling like he was trying to plan his own demise.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\n\nJimin went from staring blankly to moaning. Jeongguk grabbed his hips and started to fuck him again with vigor, and he angled downward and \n\njust right. \n\nHe didn\u2019t even have to touch Jimin. He refused to relent, encouraging Jimin over Jimin\u2019s breathless but loud moans, his pleas. Jimin suddenly grabbed at the sheets again and then tried to grab for Jeongguk, but it was no use. He thrashed and kicked his legs, but Jeongguk kept him still. The pleasure build-up was so intense that Jimin lost his ability to form words. Every sound out of his mouth was a strangled moan, his head thrown back, elbows digging into the mattress as he fought against it, so overstimulated that he could hardly stand it.\n\n\n\u201cGo ahead. Come on, baby. Feel good? Come for me.\u201d\n\n\nJimin\u2019s vision was a blur, and suddenly, he was panting, his chest burning. When he let out a gasping moan, back arching, he felt tears in his eyes, and he didn\u2019t even fight it. His next breath was something like a sob, and then he let out a shout that caught in the back of his throat as the orgasm damn near blinded him. He spilled all over his own stomach and chest, completely untouched, his legs shaking, hearing Jeongguk\u2019s voice coaxing him through it, and not missing the way Jeongguk cursed and thrusted so roughly as he came that Jimin\u2019s body jolted against the bed.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m in heaven. I\u2019m dead, and this is what heaven is like. I made it. God has tattoos.\n\n\n\nJimin couldn\u2019t open his eyes, but he felt a hand gently stroking his hair, felt soft lips peppering his face with kisses, heard sweet whispers of praise in his ear. He was still out of breath, his head spinning, and he could feel Jeongguk inside him as he came down from the high. There was a moment of silence, two pounding heartbeats meeting chest-to-chest, and then Jimin felt a thumb brushing tears from his cheeks.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d\n\n\nJimin let out a whimper and a sigh as Jeongguk slipped out, and he finally opened his eyes and stared at the ceiling in sheer disbelief for the second time, his body buzzing, skin thrumming, the orgasm still sizzling through him quietly. He heard running water in the bathroom, and then Jeongguk crawled back onto the bed. A wet washcloth touched Jimin\u2019s skin, and that brought him back to his senses.\n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered as Jeongguk wiped him down, following it up with soft kisses against damp skin. Once they were both clean off, Jimin rolled to the other side of his bed where the sheets were clean, still dazed, and Jeongguk crawled onto the bed, pulling Jimin right into his arms. Jimin curled up immediately, swinging one leg over Jeongguk\u2019s hips to straddle him in a hug, burying his face in Jeongguk\u2019s neck. Jeongguk\u2019s fingers danced up and down his spine, sending chills across Jimin\u2019s skin, his body completely spent.\n\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d Jeongguk whispered. \u201cDid I follow through on my promises?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou can make yourself right at home. Shower. Coffee. Clothes. How do you like your eggs in the morning?\u201d Jimin whispered, and Jeongguk laughed quietly, still rubbing Jimin\u2019s back in a soothing fashion. \u201cI can\u2019t stand you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou made me cry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAs promised.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know how many men I\u2019ve had sex with?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow many?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDozens. Why are you the clich\u00e9?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe clich\u00e9?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe one that comes along and fucks me so well that I cry. This is a joke,\u201d Jimin whispered in complaint, and Jeongguk let out another laugh, turning and pressing his lips to Jimin\u2019s bruised neck.\n\n\n\u201cI said I wanted to ruin you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t just talk a big game.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m usually vers,\u201d Jimin murmured. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to make me change my mind. I hate you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re agreeing,\u201d Jeongguk whispered. \u201cThat we should absolutely have sex again sometime.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m agreeing to nothing,\u201d Jimin muttered, and Jeongguk snickered. \u201cYou were right.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe orgasm was better with the edging.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat was bare minimum edging.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStill edging.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you satisfied?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cVery.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen that\u2019s all I care about,\u201d Jeongguk whispered, and Jimin swore his voice was a carefully crafted lullaby. He was starting to drift off to the sound of it, completely sated and sexually satisfied, his mind floating off happily. After a bit of a struggle, he sat up.\n\n\n\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d he wondered. Jeongguk blinked up at him, and Jimin almost spun around to suck this man\u2019s dick for a second time, because he was unreal. Ethereal beauty. Effortless. Eyes meant to captivate. The way he had complete control during sex but gave Jimin the intimacy afterwards that he so desperately needed\u2026 Jimin bent down and kissed Jeongguk\u2019s waiting lips, his hands pressed to Jeongguk\u2019s strong chest.\n\n\n\u201cI can if you need me to,\u201d Jeongguk said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStay.\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk raised his eyebrows. Jimin stared. Neither of them blinked until Jeongguk just popped his lips once, and Jimin dissolved into laughter, ducking his head, hands still hooking over Jeongguk\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\n\u201cOkay, I get it. I know it\u2019s after a first date and it still might be weird, but I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it,\u201d Jimin argued. Jeongguk lifted one hand to cup behind Jimin\u2019s neck and brought him closer for a kiss.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay,\u201d he whispered between kisses. \u201cBut I have to get up early to pick up Dasom.\u201d\n\n\nJimin pressed another kiss to Jeongguk\u2019s lips. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Just\u2026 yeah. Just stay.\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk didn\u2019t present an argument. He helped Jimin change the sheets and took the toothbrush that Jimin offered. Jimin laughed to himself while Jeongguk was washing up, because he was tempted to start limping while he walked to accommodate for how well he had just been fucked.\n\n\nIn nothing but their underwear, they both crawled into Jimin\u2019s bed, and Jimin took a deep breath. Sleepovers were not a usual thing for him, but Jeongguk just had this \n\nvibe. \n\nSafe. Comforting. Familiar. Trustworthy. But when Jimin flicked the light off and felt Jeongguk reach for him, it felt like a fever dream. Suddenly, he was lying on his back with Jeongguk curled up in his arms, resting on his shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cTold you that you had nothing to lose,\u201d he whispered, and Jimin smiled.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, well, when I can\u2019t walk in the morning, we\u2019ll know why.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of that, you know,\u201d Jeongguk muttered, and Jimin snickered, shifting his body to curl in towards Jeongguk more.\n\n\n\u201cIs this weird?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cI was teaching your daughter reading and writing two weeks ago.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd now you\u2019re not, so here we are,\u201d Jeongguk whispered back, chuckling. \u201cIt\u2019s only weird if you want it to be weird. Otherwise, it\u2019s just two grown men who met each other, hit it off, went on a date, and got horny.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat was a little more than horny.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShh.\u201d Jeongguk reached up and set his finger against Jimin\u2019s lips, and Jimin stifled a laugh. \u201cAh, my alarm is on. I hope that\u2019s okay. I usually wake up before it goes off.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Jimin whispered. \u201cGet up whenever. Help yourself to anything. I meant what I said.\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk settled in comfortably with a slow exhale that hinted at sleep. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\nIt was nothing more than a breathy whisper, and Jimin closed his eyes again and sank into his pillows, surrounded by Jeongguk\u2019s lingering soapy scent as he drifted off.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJimin smacked his lips quietly as he stirred and awoke, sensing that there were hints of daylight streaming through his bedroom but not sure about the time. He shifted underneath the sheets, and that\u2019s when he felt the dull but satisfying aches in his body, a telltale sign that last night had been far beyond what he could have ever imagined.\n\n\nThe smell of coffee wafted in the air as Jimin slowly rolled onto his back, and that smell forced him to open his eyes. There was Jeongguk, sitting on the edge of the bed in nothing but his Calvin Klein boxer briefs, eyes a bit sleepy as he held up a coffee cup that belonged to Jimin.\n\n\n\u201cYou made yourself coffee,\u201d Jimin whispered with a tired smile.\n\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to take the \u2018help yourself\u2019 offer seriously until I woke up,\u201d Jeongguk admitted, and Jimin breathily chuckled. Jeongguk set the coffee cup onto the bedside table, and then he swung his legs up onto the bed and shimmied under the sheets. He rolled, and Jimin met him halfway, almost as if his body was naturally responding to whatever Jeongguk was about to offer. Jeongguk propped on one elbow, slung his other arm across Jimin\u2019s waist, and leaned down to kiss him.\n\n\n\u201cI have to leave\u2026 to pick up Dasom\u2026 in ten minutes,\u201d he whispered against Jimin\u2019s lips between kisses. \u201cThank you for letting me stay here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the least I could do,\u201d Jimin whispered back, and Jeongguk smiled into the next kiss. \u201cCan you just\u2026?\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk didn\u2019t even ask for Jimin to finish the sentence. He slid down and found a comfortable place right in Jimin\u2019s arms, and Jimin\u2019s eyes fell shut again as his fingers absentmindedly fluttered through Jeongguk\u2019s soft hair.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember the last time I did this,\u201d Jeongguk murmured.\n\n\n\u201cMm. All that hot sex and you\u2019re a sucker for cuddling,\u201d Jimin muttered, and Jeongguk snickered, his hand still wrapped around Jimin\u2019s hip.\n\n\n\u201cWhat is it that they say about K-Pop idols? Duality. I have duality,\u201d he said, and Jimin\u2019s shoulders shook with laughter. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if you feel the same, but last night was incredible. Not just the sex.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThough it was a highlight.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. Absolutely,\u201d Jeongguk confirmed, and Jimin grinned, his eyes still closed. \u201cBut besides the sex, the date itself was really nice.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm. Surprised we kept it in our pants for almost two hours.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMe too. We did well. Go team.\u201d Jeongguk lifted his fist, and Jimin cracked his eyes open just enough to see it and bump it, trying not to laugh. \u201cI want to see you again. I have no idea when, since the new semester starts on Monday, but I don\u2019t want this to be our only date.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMe neither. I want to see you again, too,\u201d Jimin admitted. Confessed. Not a hint of hesitation, and was that normal? Did he usually hesitate? Or did he usually just play it off with the old \u201ctext me\u201d line before never seeing his sexual partners again? This time, though, he meant it. \u201cWe can do dinner on weeknights. One Saturday a month. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk shifted and rolled onto his stomach, slinging his arm across Jimin\u2019s waist. \u201cWe\u2019ll work something out. I promise. I know we\u2019ll both be busy. Let\u2019s agree to be adults about it. But I wouldn\u2019t mind dinner or a Saturday night together.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know my number,\u201d Jimin whispered just as Jeongguk leaned in for another kiss. His thumb caressed Jimin\u2019s cheek and jaw, and then he sighed and rolled off the bed, grabbing the coffee cup off the bedside table and taking a large sip.\n\n\n\u201cThis is a lot to ask, but do you have any clothing that \n\nisn\u2019t \n\nwhat I wore last night?\u201d Jeongguk sheepishly asked, and Jimin let out a sleepy laugh, stretching his arms overhead and sitting up.\n\n\n\u201cThought you\u2019d have to go home first to swap over to your car,\u201d Jimin said, and Jeongguk blew out a breath.\n\n\n\u201cShort for time,\u201d he said in a pained voice. \u201cQuite literally going to get off my motorcycle and get into my car.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I \n\ndid\n\n tell you to help yourself,\u201d Jimin remarked with a smile. \u201cAlthough I think you might rip my clothes with all that muscle.\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk rolled his eyes for Jimin to see, so Jimin hopped out of bed and pawed through his clothing, offering up a pair of sweatpants and a black hoodie\u2014clothing that he normally wore that wouldn\u2019t rattle Dasom if she saw her father in it. Jeongguk pulled the hood up and downed the rest of the coffee, and then he ducked into the bathroom to brush his teeth as Jimin sat on the edge of the bed sleepily. Jeongguk came out checking the time on his phone, and then he pulled Jimin to his feet.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you again soon,\u201d he said, brushing his thumb over Jimin\u2019s bottom lip. \u201cThank you for an amazing night.\u201d\n\n\nJimin was done letting Jeongguk get the best of him; he gently pushed Jeongguk\u2019s hood down, carded his fingers through Jeongguk\u2019s hair, and kissed him fiercely, bodies pressed together. Jeongguk let out a small moan in the back of his throat, and Jimin gently ran his tongue across Jeongguk\u2019s bottom lip as Jeongguk\u2019s hands found purchase on Jimin\u2019s hips.\n\n\n\u201cGod, you make everything worth it,\u201d Jeongguk laughed with one more kiss, running his hand underneath Jimin\u2019s shirt to the small of his back. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon. I swear I will.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSee you soon,\u201d Jimin whispered, and then he watched as Jeongguk pulled his hood back up, smiled, and left the apartment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[moodboard by cata]\n\n\n~ ~ ~\n\n\nKyodong Elementary School was a nightmare.\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a terrible school, per say; it was that the school\u2019s attendees had helicopter parents and a bullying problem, and a staff full of bystanders who turned a blind eye. It was like something straight out of a drama\u2014two days ago, a fifth grader dumped his milk on the head of his classmate, and the teacher looked away because her job would be at stake otherwise if the father, a CEO of a food distribution company, caught wind of his son being punished.\n\n\n\u201cOkay, how many?\u201d\n\n\nThe giggles escalated, but all of the students kept their hands on their head, except for three students who had removed one hand each. Miyeon put both hands over her mouth with the same giggle, but then she started to count out loud. All of her classmates were standing up at their desks, and Jimin was working with the class on practical methods of subtraction. Because a few of them had struggled with the homework, he was applying it in a way that would make sense.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Miyeon put her hands on her hips. The class had already worked together to figure out exactly how many hands the class of twenty had in total by adding twenty plus twenty to get forty. Now they were subtracting. \u201cHmm, that\u2019s\u2014oh! That\u2019s taking away three. That\u2019s\u2026 Thirty-seven?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Jimin said, and Miyeon\u2019s classmates clapped happily.\n\n\nAt the very least, though, Jimin\u2019s class was lovely, and all of them were oblivious to the troubles that plagued the higher grades. Inner peace was the exact reason why Jimin chose to teach first grade and would go no higher than second grade.\n\n\nJimin\u2019s class had adjusted quite well to his presence. It was April now, and they had been with him for one month. So far, though, Jimin hadn\u2019t quite connected with any of his students on more than a surface level. But he was also constantly distracted, doing his job but wondering if there was something more that he could do, wondering if his new placement was a wake-up call or the right place for him to be. This was his ninth year, after all. Perhaps it was time for a change, because he was beginning to doubt his own consistency.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nmood: \u201cbreak my heart\u201d by dua lipa (fic title in this song)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJimin feared that his sudden shift to a worried mindset regarding his career was thanks to a thirty-year-old single father of one, and the worst part was that the feeling was thrilling. It was something \n\nnew, \n\nsomething exciting, and it was making him restless. He hadn\u2019t seen Jeongguk since their date, but that wasn\u2019t stopping them from communicating with each other. Jimin found himself texting Jeongguk like some giddy teenager every now and again, and after school was no different.\n\n\n\n\n\nJEONGGUK [04:03:38PM]\n\n\n\nKind of miss hearing Dasom\u2019s stories about you when I pick her up from school\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJIMIN [04:05:20PM]\n\n\n\nI miss having her in my class.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJEONGGUK [04:06:13PM]\n\n\n\nDo you miss me, too?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJIMIN [04:07:01PM]\n\n\n\nMiss everything about you right now, please let me see you soon\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJEONGGUK [04:08:19PM]\n\n\n\nDasom goes to ice skating for two hours right after school on Thursdays\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJEONGGUK [04:09:02PM]\n\n\n\nI work late at the gym that day\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJEONGGUK [04:09:48PM]\n\n\n\nYou should stop by ;) have your free personal training session that I promised\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJIMIN [04:10:17PM]\n\n\n\nIf that\u2019s when I can see you, then I can stop by after school!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs if Jimin could focus worth a damn on Thursday, he hid a small backpack underneath his desk that felt like a dirty secret the entire time he was teaching, and it only distracted him further. He encouraged his class to clean the room with enthusiasm at the end of the day, smiling and ruffling hair, thanking them for their hard work when the desks were all wiped down.\n\n\n\u201cQuickly! Grab your shoes!\u201d Jimin called out at dismissal, watching his students bustle around and grab their belongings, ducking in and out of the classroom to the shoe storage boxes. They all hollered their goodbyes, waving to Jimin, and then Jimin\u2019s classroom emptied out. Jimin stood near the door, because he didn\u2019t have any dismissal duties this semester. It wasn\u2019t until he was sure that the hallways were empty that he dove for the backpack underneath his desk. He then changed into FILA workout gear and shrugged into his windbreaker, leaving the school as quickly as possible.\n\n\nGolden Personal Training was about fifteen minutes from Kyodong, and it was nestled between a PC caf\u00e9 and a phone repair shop. The windows were tinted, but there was a sign that matched the business card Jeongguk had given Jimin.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this. I\u2019m really showing up to do who-knows-what because I haven\u2019t seen this man in one month.\n\n\n\nJimin gently pushed the door open, hearing the faint background thumping of some music playing. The gym had dark grey padded floors and plenty of matching equipment\u2014two treadmills, a bike, weight machines, an entire rack of weights with a mirror on the wall, a space for deadlifting and pull-ups, and a corner with a punching bag. There were no other patrons, leaving Jimin free to look around curiously. There were framed certifications on one of the walls, and there was also a framed photo of Jeongguk with Dasom sitting on his shoulder, one arm up like she was flexing her muscles.\n\n\n\u201cJimin-ssi?\u201d\n\n\nFrom a small office to the left, Jeongguk emerged, and the butterflies that had been dormant in Jimin\u2019s stomach for about a month came alive. There was Jeongguk in nothing but black gym shorts and a fitted black t-shirt, tattooed arms crossed, grinning at Jimin. He strolled forward as Jimin took a deep breath and cracked his knuckles.\n\n\n\u201cGood to see you,\u201d he said, and Jeongguk gently ran his bottom lip along his top teeth.\n\n\n\u201cYou even came dressed appropriately.\u201d He paused, and then he swiped his tongue across his bottom lip, taking a few steps forward. \u201cI really didn\u2019t think this through, did I?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMeaning what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMeaning I didn\u2019t really\u2026\u201d Jeongguk wiggled both hands palms-up like he was a scale. \u201c...\n\nfactor in \n\njust how bad it would be. Not seeing you for a month. You really did a number on me, because I\u2019m not even thinking about my job right now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been flirting with you like a teenager over text message for a month,\u201d Jimin replied, trying not to laugh. \u201cI think we should just both admit that we\u2019re into this and get it over with. Takes two to play, you know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI agree. Well, I did promise you a personal training session,\u201d Jeongguk said, crossing his arms again. \u201cWhich would include an entire initial consultation session to see how you move and what would suit you best and what your goals are. But I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think you know how I move. And how my body works. And what suits me best,\u201d Jimin casually replied as Jeongguk raised one eyebrow with a small smirk. \u201cSo I\u2019ll just let you decide. Though I wouldn\u2019t really mind having someone check my posture while weightlifting. My hyung always works out and tells me to fix it whenever we\u2019re at the gym together.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d Jeongguk agreed with a small smile. Jimin stepped over to the weightlifting area near the mirror and shrugged out of his backpack, and Jeongguk asked him to do a quick stretch while he went to lock the door, since Jimin would be the last patron visiting the gym for the day. Jimin stretched his arms and torso and legs quickly, and Jeongguk returned and picked up two light weights.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll use two-kilo weights to start,\u201d he declared, and Jimin took them. \u201cJust show me what you normally do.\u201d\n\n\nJimin nodded, and then he demonstrated a few of the arm exercises that he did with weights. As he moved, Jeongguk circled him slowly, and every so often, he lunged and gently grabbed Jimin\u2019s arms or shoulders to manipulate him, tapping and pointing and explaining exactly what to do while Jimin adjusted.\n\n\n\u201cMhm, shoulders down. Scoot your feet a little. That\u2019s perfect.\u201d Jeongguk stood in front of Jimin with a few fingertips on Jimin\u2019s shoulders, and Jimin clutched the weights and stared, waiting until Jeongguk realized it. The moment Jeongguk caught Jimin\u2019s eye, he leaned in for a kiss, and Jimin didn\u2019t stop him. He breathed a sigh of relief into the kiss, because damn it, he had been waiting for it and it was \n\nworth it.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take these,\u201d Jeongguk whispered against Jimin\u2019s lips, and then he kissed Jimin again as he gently took the weights from Jimin\u2019s hands. He turned and put them back, and then he grabbed Jimin by the waist for another kiss. Jimin circled his arms around Jeongguk\u2019s neck and kissed him back feverishly, almost desperately, because one month was too long to be away from this man\u2019s lips. Jimin couldn\u2019t recall a time when he had ever craved another man\u2019s touch and attention so deeply. Addiction wasn\u2019t something he was prone to, but Jeongguk was making a fool of him.\n\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t last very long,\u201d Jimin breathily said between kisses, and Jeongguk laughed.\n\n\n\u201cBe honest,\u201d he murmured against Jimin\u2019s cheek before trailing kisses down his neck. \u201cNeither of us are here for a personal training session.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe not, but\u2014but the tips you gave me are good,\u201d Jimin replied, and then he gritted his teeth. \n\n\u201cFuck, \n\nyou drive me crazy. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve been thinking about you like this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou too?\u201d Jeongguk murmured, finding Jimin\u2019s lips again.\n\n\n\u201cI definitely haven\u2019t been brainstorming all the ways to convince you to get me back into bed again,\u201d Jimin gasped, laughing at the same time that Jeongguk did.\n\n\n\u201cOkay, so it\u2019s not just me,\u201d he muttered, swiping his tongue across Jimin\u2019s bottom lip before diving in for another kiss. \u201cBeen waiting for a good time to get you alone. Damn near impossible with a kid and your work schedule.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo then we just have to find time,\u201d Jimin said breathlessly. \u201cLike in a gym after school hours.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUnder the ruse of personal training. Jesus, I\u2019m that desperate,\u201d Jeongguk said, his hands all over Jimin\u2019s body in ways that made Jimin shiver excitedly. This was exactly what he had been hoping for, even if it had seemed like a long shot in the moment, and now it was happening. Jeongguk\u2019s hands were on Jimin\u2019s waist. Jimin\u2019s hands were fighting underneath Jeongguk\u2019s shirt to touch smooth skin. Things were escalating very quickly and very much in the direction Jimin had been hoping.\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re desperate, then what does that make me?\u201d Jimin asked, tilting his head so Jeongguk could kiss along the column of his neck again. \u201cBeen thinking of you fucking me again for weeks.\u201d\n\n\n\u2018I\u2019d fuck you again in a heartbeat,\u201d Jeongguk said without hesitation. \u201cAll you have to do is ask. Waiting for the day you\u2019ll fuck \n\nme, \n\nthough. I\u2019m vers.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll fuck you right now,\u201d Jeongguk all but growled, his hands grabbing Jimin\u2019s ass before settling on his hips. \u201cPut you right up against this mirror. Told you I wanted you to see yourself how I see you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make time.\u201d\n\n\nJimin wanted to make a thousand jokes about how this was something straight out of a porno, how this was not the kind of ambitious endeavor that most people risked in their day-to-day lives. But Jeongguk seemed down for anything, and Jimin was both horny and hooked. If they could just fuck it out and then decide what the hell they were doing, then perhaps they would be better off.\n\n\nJeongguk laughed himself to near tears when Jimin yanked a condom with an attached packet of lube out of his backpack, but he didn\u2019t ask questions. He used up most of the lube for his fingers, and then he spun Jimin into the mirror and wedged him between two of the weight racks, forcing Jimin to press his hands to the mirror with a small gasp. Jeongguk gently but deliberately pulled Jimin\u2019s track pants down to his thighs, and then he ran his hand over Jimin\u2019s ass reverently.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nmood: \u201cwRoNg\u201d (feat. kehlani) by zayn\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNever fucked a man as gorgeous as you,\u201d he complimented, and Jimin glanced up in the mirror, watching as Jeongguk slowly slipped one finger into him. Jimin\u2019s back arched automatically at the intrusion, and Jeongguk braced his other hand on the small of Jimin\u2019s back, looking in the mirror as well. \u201cNot that you need the compliments. That\u2019s shallow of me. But you really are beautiful.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, shit,\u201d Jimin breathed, one hand slipping as he pushed his hips back. He didn\u2019t want to look at himself in the mirror, not yet. The very thought was too much for him. He just ducked his head, grateful that the doors to the gym were locked, because he was exposed completely.\n\n\nJeongguk slipped in a second finger and began to scissors them gently, reaching deeper until he had Jimin crying out, hands slipping against the glass. The way his free hand massaged Jimin\u2019s ass before he lifted Jimin upright with an arm around his chest was so sexy that Jimin\u2019s knees weakened.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOkay, pull it together. You\u2019re in complete control here. Or so you think. No, you\u2019re not in control at all. Let it happen. You always try to be in control, anyways. Just give in.\n\n\n\n\u201cJeongguk, please,\u201d Jimin whispered, his head falling back against Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder, eyes closed as Jeongguk\u2019s fingers reached so deeply inside him that Jimin swore he was going to faint. Jeongguk\u2019s fingers disappeared quickly, but only for a moment. There was a shift, some movement, the sound of lube, and then Jeongguk was spreading Jimin and pressing the tip of his cock to Jimin\u2019s hole. Jimin immediately pitched forward again, hands on the mirror, and took a deep breath.\n\n\n\u201cShit, you\u2019re still so tight,\u201d Jeongguk cursed, and Jimin gritted his teeth but took Jeongguk all the way, relaxing all of his muscles as Jeongguk bottomed out.\n\n\n\u201cFast and hard,\u201d Jimin said with his eyes closed. \u201cThat\u2019s how I want it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDone.\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk pulled out nearly all the way before snapping his hips and thrusting back into Jimin in one go, Jimin nearly falling into the mirror. And he didn\u2019t relent from that point forward. He fucked Jimin with vigor as Jimin clung to the mirror, his cock hanging helplessly and untouched while Jeongguk had a bruising grip on his hips. With one particularly rough thrust, Jimin moaned, and that was when Jeongguk wrapped one hand around Jimin\u2019s cock and pulled him more upright, an arm wrapped around his chest again.\n\n\n\u201cLook at yourself. Look in the mirror,\u201d he whispered in Jimin\u2019s ear, kissing the shell of it before dragging his lips down Jimin\u2019s neck, speaking words into Jimin\u2019s throat. \u201cLook how sexy you look. Look how beautiful you are like this. Look.\u201d\n\n\nJimin dared to open his eyes, and he stared, catching his breath. Jeongguk was still shallowly thrusting inside him, tip of his cock brushing Jimin\u2019s prostate every so often. His large hand wrapped around Jimin\u2019s cock entirely, but that wasn\u2019t the focus. Jimin\u2019s eyes were glazed over and half-lidded, hair tousled, cheeks flushed, neck splotchy and red with new marks, lips kiss-bitten and slightly parted.\n\n\n\u201cSee what I see?\u201d Jeongguk muttered, using one hand to grip Jimin\u2019s chin so that he was forced to look in the mirror. \u201cTell me you see how gorgeous you are.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm,\u201d Jimin hummed as Jeongguk circled his hips, his hand steadily stroking Jimin, lips pressing wet kisses down Jimin\u2019s neck as he nosed at the collar of Jimin\u2019s t-shirt. Never in his life had Jimin assumed he would find himself sexy, but the way he looked right now was borderline obscene in the best possible way, all thanks to Jeongguk. \u201cJeongguk, just\u2014please, just\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHand,\u201d Jeongguk muttered, so Jimin replaced Jeongguk\u2019s hand with his own, and Jeongguk\u2019s hands returned to Jimin\u2019s hips. \u201cI\u2019ll be quick.\u201d\n\n\nHe meant it. Jimin\u2019s body lurched forward as Jeongguk fucked into him hard and fast, and Jimin\u2019s hand matched the pace and rhythm Jeongguk set. He pushed his hips back in desperation, sweaty palm fully pressed to the mirror, and he dropped his head with a moan when he felt the orgasm building in the pit of his stomach.\n\n\n\u201cFuck, I\u2019m gonna come,\u201d Jeongguk suddenly said, and Jimin\u2019s heart leapt into his throat, because Jeongguk coming first felt like a victory. Jimin slowed his hand, and Jeongguk\u2019s thrusts became faster and more erratic, his fingers leaving bruises on Jimin\u2019s hips as he gripped and pulled Jimin back onto him. Jimin slapped his other hand on the mirror, not caring where it had just been, and then he lifted his head and arched his back slightly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHarder,\u201d he gasped out, and Jeongguk let out a quiet stream of curse words as, with one final thrust, he let out a labored breath, hips pressed to Jimin\u2019s ass, head bowed, hands slipping down Jimin\u2019s thighs. His breath came out ragged as he slowed down and stopped altogether, licking his lips, hands fluttering across Jimin\u2019s lower back.\n\n\n\u201cShh,\u201d he suddenly said, and then his hand found Jimin\u2019s cock again, and Jimin whimpered, biting his bottom lip. Jeongguk seemed to know exactly what to do, because with a few deft strokes and a flick of the wrist, Jimin came undone, spilling all over the mirror and Jeongguk\u2019s hand, clawing at the glass to keep himself upright.\n\n\n\u201cJesus,\u201d he sighed out, the sizzle of a post-orgasm haze washing over him in steady waves\n\n\n\u201cI just cleaned those mirrors,\u201d Jeongguk murmured, and Jimin, still sweating, promptly reached back and smacked Jeongguk\u2019s thigh. Jeongguk snickered, and then he gently pulled out while holding the condom in place as Jimin caught his breath. Jeongguk disappeared and returned with a towel, and he and Jimin both cleaned off. Jimin laughed and re-dressed as Jeongguk wiped down and cleaned the mirror, clicking his tongue in fake disapproval.\n\n\n\u201cOkay. We need a plan.\u201d Jeongguk sat down on a workout bench and pulled Jimin into his lap, and Jimin straddled him willingly, carding his fingers through Jeongguk\u2019s short hair. \u201cTo see each other more often. Otherwise, we\u2019re going to be jumping each other\u2019s bones every single time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen stop being so good at fucking me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd you expect me to do that \n\nhow?\u201d\n\n\n\nJimin snickered as Jeongguk raised both eyebrows. \u201cKidding. I agree, though. The sex has been great. But there\u2019s more to this than just sex.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJimin-ssi.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin corrected him, and Jeongguk seemed slightly stunned before he continued.\n\n\n\u201c...Hyung,\u201d he said carefully, gauging Jimin\u2019s reaction. \u201cLook, it\u2019s not going to be as easy as we think. I have to leave in\u2026\u201d He whipped his head to look at the clock on the wall. \u201cFifteen minutes to go pick up Dasom from ice skating. And then it\u2019s straight home for dinner, homework, shower, and bedtime. My life revolves around her. She comes first. You never will. I get that that sounds harsh, but I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJeongguk-ah,\u201d Jimin interrupted, scratching the base of Jeongguk\u2019s scalp with his fingernails. \u201cI understand that. I\u2019m not asking to come first. But this feels like a good thing. I actually want to spend more time with you than just a random date or two. I want to see where this could go. Maybe nowhere, but\u2026 I mean, we won\u2019t know unless we try harder.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt scares me.\u201d Jeongguk blinked up at Jimin with round eyes full of worry, a complete departure from the man who had had Jimin by the chin while fucking him from behind ten minutes ago. \u201cThinking of introducing someone into Dasom\u2019s life. Because what if you\u2019re not permanent? Then she\u2019s heartbroken. Do you get what I mean?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo we take it slow. It scares me, too,\u201d Jimin admitted. \u201cI never expected to be interested in a man with a seven-year-old daughter, but here I am.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be eight in June.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know. She\u2019s on the thirteenth, just like me,\u201d Jimin said softly with a small smile. \u201cLook, she\u2019s the one who played matchmaker in the first place. She\u2019s a smart kid. We\u2019ll take it slow. Can I see you on Saturday?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can send her to Hoseok and Yoongi,\u201d Jeongguk said mostly to himself, and then he nodded. \u201cOkay. Saturday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome over to my place,\u201d Jimin suggested. \u201cNothing fancy. We\u2019ll order delivery and watch a movie. Play a game. Doesn\u2019t matter. What do you think?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d Jeongguk replied, sounding thrilled. \u201cOne day, though, we have to go to a nightclub together. Just once. Just for shits and giggles. I\u2019m curious.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d Jimin leaned in and kissed Jeongguk sweetly. \u201cThanks for inviting me here. Though I didn\u2019t really use much of it, you have a nice gym.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou used the most important piece of equipment,\u201d Jeongguk joked, and he burst out laughing when Jimin groaned. \u201cThanks for coming. I know it was random, but I panicked. I had to come up with something. Didn\u2019t want to lose the opportunity.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, at least now I know where you film half of your Instagram videos,\u201d Jimin teased, and then he climbed off Jeongguk\u2019s lap and stretched his arms. With one final kiss, he smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll see you on Saturday night. Come over whenever. Just text me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI will.\u201d A single dimple appeared in Jeongguk\u2019s cheek when he smiled. \u201cSee you then.\u201d\n\n\nJimin snatched up his backpack as Jeongguk retreated into his office. The music turned off overhead just as Jimin unlocked the door and walked out of the gym, and then he waited until he rounded the corner to laugh and collapse against the side of his car in relief and sheer happiness. Then he pulled out his phone and let his fingers fly:\n\n\n\n\n\nJIMIN [05:56:32PM]\n\n\n\nSOS, I just let hot dad fuck me in his gym and now we have a date on Saturday\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJIMIN [05:57:02PM]\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s happening\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nTAEHYUNG [05:58:04PM]\n\n\n\nYOU LET HIM DO WHAT\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNAMJOON [05:58:42PM]\n\n\n\nLOLLLLLLLLLLLL Jimin\u2019s really going to date a single father, this is amazing\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJIMIN [05:59:12PM]\n\n\n\nYou fuckers, I really like him, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nTAEHYUNG [06:00:21PM]\n\n\n\nEmbrace it????

Once his phone was in the holder, he stared at himself in the rearview mirror.\n\n\n\nSome personal trainer. My neck is a mess. \n\nJimin almost laughed out loud as he touched his skin, because if it was bruised, he would have to cover it with makeup tomorrow. But no matter what, it was worth it.\n\n\nJeongguk was worth it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDad.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDad.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMhm.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDad.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the off button?\u201d Jeongguk grumbled into his pillow, reaching out and poking a giggling girl with his finger. \u201cI hate this alarm.\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk rolled onto his back with a grunt, flinging one arm over his forehead, and then he let out another grunt as Dasom climbed onto the bed, wiggled under the covers, and threw her upper body across Jeongguk\u2019s chest. Without looking, Jeongguk dropped his other hand onto her back and rubbed affectionately as she hugged him with one arm, and then he felt a little finger poking at the underside of his chin.\n\n\n\u201cDad.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bite your finger off.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI want to make pancakes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDad, \n\nit\u2019s Sunday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot pancake day,\u201d Jeongguk murmured, eyes still closed as he fought back a smile. \u201cThere\u2019s a fridge full of food. Cereal. Yogurt. Fruit. Powdered donuts. You could eat the entire bag of powdered donuts. Why pancakes?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI want to put blueberries in them.\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk finally opened his eyes and glanced down at his chest. Dasom was lying there with her head turned to the side, blinking at Jeongguk expectantly. She was still wearing her rainbow-striped pajamas, but she had coaxed her long black hair into a messy ponytail with a blue scrunchie, even though it was a little lopsided. Jeongguk reached down and stroked her ponytail, twirling it around his fingers as Dasom stuck her bottom lip out and closed her eyes.\n\n\n\u201cMake me pancakes,\u201d she grumbled.\n\n\n\u201cMake your own pancakes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan I?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t use the stove,\u201d Jeongguk complained, and Dasom giggled. \u201cOkay, just go and mix all the ingredients together.\u201d He waved one hand, eyes closed. \u201cYou know where everything is, right? You\u2019re seven. You can do precise baking measurements.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t reach the pancake mix in the pantry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot the \n\npantry,\u201d \n\nJeongguk said dramatically, and then he grabbed Dasom around the waist and flung her to the other side of the bed as she let out a yelp. Jeongguk instantly rolled over and yanked the covers high above his head, burrowing, but Dasom weaseled her way in and smacked Jeongguk\u2019s bare chest indignantly.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost nine o\u2019clock!\u201d she shouted, and then she used her two small hands to squish Jeongguk\u2019s cheeks. He pouted on purpose, and she giggled as he talked nonsense just to make her laugh. \u201cDad, come \n\non. \n\nI\u2019m hungry. Feed me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFine, \n\nfine,\u201d Jeongguk sighed, throwing back the covers. Then he kicked his legs like he was throwing a tantrum as Dasom laughed, shoving him playfully.\n\n\n\u201cGet \n\nup, \n\nDad,\u201d she said through her laughter. \u201cWe can watch more \n\nHaikyuu!!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you brush your teeth?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd wash your face?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlright, fine. Blueberry pancakes.\u201d\n\n\nDasom skipped out of the bedroom the moment Jeongguk was on his feet, and he yawned, grabbing the shirt he had thrown off before crawling into bed last night and dragging it onto his tired body. He brushed his teeth and splashed some water onto his face, and then he grabbed a hairbrush and walked into the kitchen, where Dasom was standing in the pantry with her hands on her hips. Jeongguk clamped the brush between his teeth, and then he grabbed Dasom by her waist and lifted her up effortlessly. She grabbed the box of pancake mix, and then she walked over to the countertop and dragged the stepping stool over from the corner.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Jeongguk asked as Dasom turned the box over and squinted at the directions like it would help her understand.\n\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 mix\u2026 dry\u2026 what\u2019s that word?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIngredients.\u201d Jeongguk pulled the scrunchie out of Dasom\u2019s hair and began to run the brush through it as she stood on the stepping stool, attempting to read.\n\n\n\u201cMix dry ingredients with one and\u2026 is that half? One and a half cups of water,\u201d she read, and Jeongguk hummed in agreement, still pulling the brush through her thick hair. When he was satisfied, he gathered it all and used the scrunchie to tie it into a high ponytail on the top of her head. Dasom continued to read in slow motion as Jeongguk ducked into the bathroom and grabbed a handful of clear rubber bands.\n\n\n\u201cSo we need how much water?\u201d he asked as he separated a strand of the ponytail and began to braid it quickly.\n\n\n\u201cOne and a half cups.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood girl. What does it say next?\u201d\n\n\nDasom continued to read the directions as Jeongguk hastily braided her ponytail into six separate braids, tying each one at the end. Once he was satisfied, he kissed the side of her head and grabbed the measuring cup. With his help, Dasom measured a cup and a half of water and added it to the dry pancake mix, and then she used the whisk to stir it all together, scraping the edges of the bowl like Jeongguk asked. Satisfied, Jeongguk then heated the pan up with some butter, and he poured the pancake mix into the measuring cup.\n\n\n\u201cSteady, steady, steady. Not too big! Chill out, chill out,\u201d he said as Dasom giggled, watching the pancake batter expand in a large circle in the pan. \u201cOkay, blueberries. Drop them in carefully. Fingers away from the edge of the pan.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs that enough?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDepends on how blue you want your skin to be.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDad.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou never know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Dasom declared, a toothless grin still on her face. She pressed her palms to the countertop, staring at the pancake as it formed bubbles, leaning in with the balls of her feet still on the stepping stool. Jeongguk reached down and dragged it over, putting her right in front of the stove and standing behind her. One thing Dasom had inherited from her mother was her petite and short stature. She was far smaller than the average girl her age, so Jeongguk could bench press her as a joke whenever he wanted.\n\n\n\u201cOkay, you see the bubbles?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat means it\u2019s almost time to flip. Here\u2019s your spatula. Lift up the edge and peek. Come on, look. Bend your head, silly. Is it golden brown?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah! It looks good.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s flip it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan we do it like the chefs do it? Without the spatula?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you want your pancake to be on the ceiling?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll use the spatula,\u201d Dasom said seriously, and Jeongguk snorted with laughter, placing his hand over hers. \u201cWait, I don\u2019t want to ruin it. Help me, Dad.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI got you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my pancake to be messed up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll eat it regardless.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOne\u2026 two\u2026 three!\u201d Dasom flipped the pancake with Jeongguk\u2019s help, and it landed in the pan with a \n\nsmack. \n\nDasom threw both of her arms up in the air victoriously, and Jeongguk chuckled.\n\n\nDasom ate her massive blueberry pancake with a side of fruit that Jeongguk gave her, and he quickly made his own pancake and ate with her as she swung her legs, chattering on and on about ice skating and how she was starting to do better and better with her \n\narabesque. \n\nJeongguk asked if she had practiced the violin lately, and Dasom sheepishly shook her head, saying the last time she had practiced was Wednesday night. Jeongguk gently recommended that she practice before her lesson tomorrow, and Dasom agreed with a smile, happy to not be scolded.\n\n\n\u201cDad?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, my love.\u201d Jeongguk stopped scratching Dasom\u2019s back for a moment, the TV still on. Breakfast was finished, the dishes were clean, and now they were indulging in some anime for an hour or so before moving on to other productive tasks for the day. Jeongguk had his legs kicked up on the coffee table, and Dasom was lying sideways in his lap with a pillow for her head, still in her pajamas. Sundays were lazy days for both of them, and rightfully so.\n\n\n\u201cWhere did you go last night?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLast night, when you dropped me off. Hoseokie \n\nsamchon \n\nsaid that you had a date.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMhm. I did.\u201d\n\n\nDasom was silent for a moment, and Jeongguk waited, thinking that she was distracted by the TV. But then she took a deep breath and rolled onto her back, staring up at Jeongguk.\u00a0\n\n\nIt hit Jeongguk like a speeding train sometimes when he looked at Dasom like this. She was his spitting image, only her nose similar to her mother\u2019s nose, and he \n\nmade her. \n\nShe was half of his DNA, and lying in his lap now, all Jeongguk could think about were all the mornings seven years ago when he had lifted her out of her crib, changed her diaper, paced the house while giving her a bottle, and then laid her on his bare chest so they could both nap. Her tiny little hands had always curled into fists against his chest, but she had sucked on her pacifier like it was a lifeline, and Jeongguk had just petted her fuzzy short hair and breathed in her powdery baby scent, pressing kisses all across her tiny head and whispering how much he loved her.\n\n\nBeing a father was not something Jeongguk had ever anticipated. He had never planned for it, but here Dasom was in all her glory. Night after night, Jeongguk had cried with Dasom cradled in his arms while \n\nshe \n\ncried, begging her to tell him what she wanted, what she needed, because he just couldn\u2019t figure it out. Was it gas? Was she hungry? Uncomfortable? And why had she picked Jeongguk, of all people, to be her father?\n\n\nDasom was an open book, transparent. She never lied to Jeongguk and never tried to hide what she was doing or what she was thinking from him. She had learned a few years ago that Jeongguk wanted honest conversations, and she liked when Jeongguk listened to her speak, liked when she could give her opinion without being disciplined. Jeongguk tried to talk to her like she was a real human being with feelings, not just a brainless child. He had no idea if he was raising her correctly or if he was a good father, but \n\nhe \n\nliked her, so that was all that really mattered.\n\n\nAnd Jimin. Jimin liked Dasom. And that mattered, too.\n\n\n\u201cWho are you going on dates with?\u201d Dasom asked, narrowing her eyes suspiciously. \u201cIs it a man or a woman?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA man.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs it my teacher?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not your teacher anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut is it him?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\nDasom squirmed and brought her knees to her chest for a moment with a grin, and then she dropped her legs, resting her folded hands on her stomach, expression serious.\n\n\n\u201cDad?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a girl in my class. Her name is Miyoung. She\u2019s my friend,\u201d Dasom explained, and Jeongguk nodded, grabbing the remote and pausing the anime so he could listen. As Dasom continued, he repeatedly stroked from her forehead into her hair, something that she liked because she said it helped make her feel calm. \u201cHer parents are divorced.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh. That\u2019s very sad.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe lives with her mom,\u201d Dasom continued. \u201cHer dad moved far away, and she doesn\u2019t see him anymore. That\u2019s sad, too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI agree.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd her mom is dating a new man now. And Miyoung said her mom is paying more attention to the man, and she thinks they\u2019re going to get married.\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk hummed, just listening, even though he had a feeling where the conversation was going. Dasom liked to tell stories that led her straight to her point. She liked to compare her own experiences to other things going on in her life and with people around her\u2014it was how she understood the world, and it was the reason why she was so introspective at just shy of eight-years-old. Jeongguk encouraged it, too, because it was great for her critical and abstract thinking skills. Maybe he was parenting blind and winging it ninety-nine percent of the time, but at least his daughter talked things out with him. That was all Jeongguk cared about in the end.\n\n\n\u201cShe said that her mom leaves her with babysitters a lot now and that when her mom invites the man for dinner, he doesn\u2019t really talk to Miyoung or give her any attention. She said she\u2019s mad because her mom isn\u2019t doing a good job caring about her, either. So Miyoung is really lonely and sad.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can understand that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be lonely and sad and left with babysitters all the time, Dad.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome here.\u201d Jeongguk sat Dasom up, tossed the pillow aside, and then pulled Dasom right into his lap sideways. She curled up and rested her head on his shoulder, one hand on his chest, the other hand in her lap. Jeongguk kissed her forehead and hugged her with both arms as tightly as he could. \u201cThank you for sharing that story with me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMhm,\u201d Dasom hummed, and Jeongguk kissed the side of her head again. He always thanked Dasom for sharing her stories, because it meant that she was communicating openly and honestly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou know that I\u2019ve only been on two real dates with him,\u201d Jeongguk quietly said, still holding his daughter close to his chest. Her fingers were right near the baby footprints tattooed over his heart\u2014her footprints. The tattoo artist had come to Jeongguk\u2019s house and everything just to get the inked baby feet to transfer properly for a tattoo. \u201cBut I want to go on more dates. I like him a lot. He\u2019s very smart. And very funny. He\u2019s nice, too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know. He was my teacher. He\u2019s the best.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe is.\u201d Jeongguk smiled. \u201cI\u2019m really happy when I go on dates with him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you kiss him?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGross.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTo \n\nyou,\u201d\n\n Jeongguk said indignantly, and Dasom giggled, cuddling in more. \u201cBut honey, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next. You know what I mean? We\u2019re learning about each other. Going on dates. Spending time together. And I\u2019m seeing where he can fit into my life. \n\nOur \n\nlife. Because you come first.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI do?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou do. I even told him that. If I had to choose between him and you, I\u2019m picking you one hundred percent of the time. You\u2019re my daughter. And I don\u2019t ever want to give \n\nanyone \n\nmore attention than you to a point where you would feel lonely and sad. And I hope that if you ever feel that way, or if you think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, that you would tell me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI would.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood. \u201c Jeongguk rubbed Dasom\u2019s shoulder affectionately. \u201cBut I also want you to understand something.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an adult,\u201d Jeongguk said simply. \u201cAnd there are a lot of things I still want to have in my life. And that might mean a boyfriend or girlfriend. Do you know how when you go to see your uncles, they\u2019re super happy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, yeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou can see that they love each other very much,\u201d Jeongguk said, referencing Hoseok and Yoongi as Dasom nodded against his chest. \u201cThey\u2019ve been together for a long time, right? And they have a pretty cool life together.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, they do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI want to have something like that in my life, too,\u201d Jeongguk stated, and he felt Dasom\u2019s small hand gently patting his chest like she was subconsciously soothing him. \u201cI want to have someone to love and be happy with and have a cool life with. I have \n\nyou, \n\nwhich is pretty great. Best thing ever. But I want what they have, too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYoongi \n\nsamchon \n\ndoes lots of really nice things for Hoseokie \n\nsamchon,\u201d \n\nDasom remarked. \u201cThey take care of each other, Dad. Do you want that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah. I do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you think Park \n\nseonsaengnim \n\ncan take good care of you?\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk smiled and closed his eyes, pulling Dasom into his chest as much as possible in a hug. She curled up willingly, bringing her knees in, and Jeongguk cherished it. She was still young enough to appreciate hugging her father. In a few years, Jeongguk wouldn\u2019t be able to hold her like this. He would have to let her be a teenager, let her do her own thing and thrive. So for now, he had to hold onto her as tightly as he could and save every hug to memory.\n\n\n\u201cI think he would. And I think I\u2019d take good care of him, too. And you know what else?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe thinks you\u2019re really cool.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe does?\u201d Dasom lifted her head, eyes wide as she stared at Jeongguk. Jeongguk nodded.\n\n\n\u201cMhm. You said that Miyoung\u2019s mother\u2019s boyfriend doesn\u2019t really talk to her much, right? That maybe he doesn\u2019t like her very much.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to have that problem,\u201d Jeongguk said, and Dasom fought a smile by pursing her lips, Bambi eyes sparkling, one dimple popping out in her cheek. \u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, Dad.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my number one,\u201d Jeongguk declared, and Dasom smiled. \u201cAlways. But I\u2019m feeling really happy right now because I\u2019m spending time with someone who I really like, and he likes you almost as much as I do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWas I his favorite student?\u201d Dasom grinned.\n\n\n\u201cYes, but don\u2019t let it go to your head,\u201d Jeongguk scolded good-naturedly, and Dasom giggled. She wiggled out of Jeongguk\u2019s arms and knelt on the floor by the coffee table, and then she popped open the container and rummaged around, humming pensively to herself. She emerged with blue, yellow, and red markers, and then she hopped back onto the couch and back into Jeongguk\u2019s lap. She dragged his arm until it was draped across her own lap, and then she uncapped the yellow marker.\n\n\n\u201cAre you gonna tell him that you love him?\u201d she asked as she began to color in the tattoos on Jeongguk\u2019s arms that didn\u2019t have color to them, like the winding staircase. She usually colored each stair differently to make a rainbow pattern.\n\n\n\u201cNot yet. It\u2019s too soon,\u201d Jeongguk replied, slouching further into the couch. \u201cYou can\u2019t rush it, you know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what people say about art,\u201d Dasom said in a singsong voice, and Jeongguk snickered. His kid was funny, and nothing made him prouder than knowing that Dasom had a sense of humor on her. Maybe it was just because she had inherited Jeongguk\u2019s terrible sense of humor and Jeongguk found himself funny, but she always made him laugh.\n\n\n\u201cWell, I think I need to wait to tell him something like that,\u201d Jeongguk replied as Dasom capped the yellow marker and grabbed the blue. She used her teeth to pop the cap, and then she snapped it onto the top of the marker and got back to work.\n\n\n\u201cWould you ever let him live with us?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very big question,\u201d Jeongguk said with a small smile. \u201cWould \n\nyou \n\nlet him live with us?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt depends.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Dasom capped the blue marker and grabbed the red, holding it up to Jeongguk. Jeongguk pulled the cap off and popped it onto the top of the marker, and Dasom got back to work. \u201cHe has to love you. He can\u2019t live here unless he loves you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cVery important.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd he has to love me, too,\u201d Dasom said in a bit of a smaller voice. \u201cBecause he can\u2019t just love you and not love me, too. That would be mean.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI agree. Loving you is very important.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd he has to make me pancakes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s \n\na condition for living with us?\u201d Jeongguk asked, and Dasom stifled a laugh, bobbing her head as her braids swung back and forth while she colored. \u201cYour standards are high, Jeon Dasom.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou told me to have high standards.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I did. Should I put my foot in my mouth?\u201d Jeongguk asked, and Dasom giggled, collapsing with her head against Jeongguk\u2019s bicep for a moment before straightening back up to reach for the red marker again. \u201cAny other conditions?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes. He has to get his own bed,\u201d Dasom said, and Jeongguk let out a bark of laughter as Dasom clicked her tongue indignantly. \u201cWell, he can\u2019t sleep in the same bed as you, because that\u2019s gross. What if he wants to \n\nkiss you? \n\nEven worse.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I deserve a bedtime kiss?\u201d Jeongguk asked, slapping his hand over heart dramatically. Dasom twisted her upper body and then lifted the red marker right near Jeongguk\u2019s face.\n\n\n\u201cStay still,\u201d she instructed. \u201cI\u2019m going to color your nose red like a clown.\u201d\n\n\nDasom then let out a shriek as Jeongguk snatched the marker, grabbed her around the waist, and lifted her right over his head like a barbell, her little body supported by his palms. He stood up, and then he maneuvered her until he was holding her by both ankles, dangling upside down.\n\n\n\u201cDAD! PUT ME DOWN!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho are you calling a clown?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYOU! YOU\u2019RE A CLOWN!\u201d she hollered, so Jeongguk shook her back and forth as she shrieked, arms flailing. \u201cPUT ME DOWN! THIS IS A CIRCUS! PUT ME DOWN!\u201d\n\n\nAfter making a lap around the coffee table and letting Dasom clean up the markers while hanging upside down, Jeongguk set her on her hands and let her cartwheel out of his hold, and she immediately lunged and started punching his stomach with her tiny fists. Jeongguk held his fists up by his head like a boxer, crouching and throwing punches at her while bouncing and breathing heavily, and Dasom finally just grabbed his arm and held on tight. Jeongguk lifted his arm up as she wrapped her legs around his bicep as well, hanging like a koala, and he carried her into her bedroom and tossed her onto the bed.\n\n\n\u201cClothes,\u201d he commanded. \u201cAnd then think about practicing, got it? Either that or we can go for a bike ride first. But you need to practice no matter what.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll practice first,\u201d Dasom sighed. \u201cAnd then can we go for a bike ride?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDeal.\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk walked back into the living room, smiling down at the half-colored staircase on his arm as he heard Dasom throwing open her closet and picking out clothes. He plopped down onto the couch with his phone, and then he heard fingers plucking at the strings of a violin. As he pulled up a text message conversation, Dasom began to play a simple song.\n\n\n\n\n\nJEONGGUK [10:52:29AM]\n\n\n\nDasom asked me if I\u2019m dating her teacher\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHOSEOK [10:53:04AM]\n\n\n\nHahahahahahaha and how did that go?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJEONGGUK [10:53:54AM]\n\n\n\nSurprisingly well\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJEONGGUK [10:54:32AM]\n\n\n\nI said I wanted to go on more dates with him and she didn\u2019t seem to mind\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJEONGGUK [10:55:16AM]\n\n\n\nShe just said that if he loves me, then he has to love her, too\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHOSEOK [10:56:02AM]\n\n\n\nDamn LOL my precious little philosopher\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJEONGGUK [10:56:49AM]\n\n\n\nI said that I wanted to have what you and Yoongi have and she liked hearing that\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHOSEOK [10:57:39AM]\n\n\n\nWell, you can look forward to being told to get a room when you kiss him in front of her\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJEONGGUK [10:58:20AM]\n\n\n\nShe said that if he lives with us, he has to sleep in his own bed\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHOSEOK [10:59:05AM]\n\n\n\nLOLLLLLLLLL absolute savage, she\u2019s definitely your kid\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHOSEOK [11:00:02AM]\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll take her next Saturday, by the way. Please. I have more clothes for her to try on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeongguk quickly got up from the couch and peeked around the corner. Dasom\u2019s bedroom door was open, and she was wearing a white long-sleeved shirt and a pair of neon green short overalls, her feet bare as she stood and played the violin bent at the waist while reading the sheet music that she had lying on her bed. Jeongguk snickered, shaking his head, but he sat back down with a smile on his face.\n\n\n\n\n\nJEONGGUK [11:00:45AM]\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s wearing your overalls right now while she\u2019s practicing the violin\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHOSEOK [11:01:32AM]\n\n\n\nTake pictures of her so I cry until Yoongi tells me to pull it together, please xxxxx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBe good.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always good.\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk glanced in the rearview mirror, and then he unbuckled his seatbelt, trying not to laugh. Dasom was wearing a pair of leopard print leggings with a little black dress and a brown fake fur warm coat with matching ankle boots. She never spared a single expense when she spent time with Hoseok and always took her time getting ready. She had even made Jeongguk put her hair in a high messy bun on the top of her head, and she was wearing a pair of sunglasses despite the setting sun.\n\n\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go,\u201d Jeongguk said, opening the backseat door. Dasom hopped out and grabbed her little black bag, and then she took Jeongguk\u2019s hand instinctively and held tight as they walked towards the luxury apartment building. Jeongguk lifted Dasom up in one arm so she could punch in Hoseok\u2019s and Yoongi\u2019s apartment code, and he held her right up to the camera as she squirmed and giggled.\n\n\n\u201cYah, it\u2019s hideous!\u201d Hoseok\u2019s voice suddenly said.\n\n\n\u201cEdna Mode! Let me in!\u201d Dasom called out.\n\n\n\u201cOf course, darling, I\u2019ll let you right up.\u201d Hoseok played along, and the door of the building slid open. Jeongguk plopped Dasom down and let her run to the elevator to press the button for the top floor of the building, and they soared up to the seventh floor. The door was already propped open, and it wasn\u2019t Hoseok standing there\u2014it was Yoongi. Black hair with an undercut, wearing comfortable workout gear even though it looked like he had been lounging and watching TV. He was smiling fondly at Dasom.\n\n\n\u201cYoongi \n\nsamchon, \n\ndo you like my outfit?\u201d Dasom asked as she walked the metaphorical runway down the hall towards their apartment.\n\n\n\u201cYou look very high fashion,\u201d Yoongi complimented. \u201cDid you remember your toothbrush this time?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in my bag,\u201d Dasom said, and then she hugged Yoongi around his waist, her head turned sideways. Yoongi cradled the back of her head affectionately and then nudged her inside with a small smile.\n\n\n\u201cHey, Gguk-ah,\u201d he said. \u201cBusy night?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHyung said he wanted Dasom here, so I\u2019m just taking advantage,\u201d Jeongguk replied with a grin, leaning against the doorframe opposite Yoongi.\n\n\n\u201cDo you need us to keep her overnight?\u201d Yoongi asked. \u201cYou know she has enough clothing here. Just say the word.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt should be okay,\u201d Jeongguk quietly replied, stepping inside and shooting Yoongi a look of gratitude. When Dasom was born, Hoseok had been single and terrified of children. He hadn\u2019t even wanted to hold Dasom until she could lift her own head up, and he had avoided babysitting her at all costs, instead asking his older sister to lend a helping hand when Jeongguk was in crisis. But then Hoseok had met Yoongi, a budding corporate lawyer, and everything had changed.\n\n\nYoongi was only a year older than Hoseok, but he had a quiet fierceness to him and loved in silence and through gestures. When he had met Jeongguk, Yoongi had immediately asked to hold Dasom, who hadn\u2019t even turned two yet. After seeing Yoongi bounce Dasom around on his lap for an hour, Hoseok had called Jeongugk in a panic a day later, saying that there was no way he could date a man so confident with children, and that he needed more practice. So Jeongguk had offered up Dasom for babysitting practice. Now, Hoseok and Dasom were thick as thieves, and Yoongi just played the role of quiet caretaker, watching his eccentric but brilliant partner roleplay as fashion designer Dasom\u2019s assistant.\n\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes\u2014oh my God,\u201d Jeongguk laughed as Dasom came stumbling out of the side room in a pair of gold shiny boots that were supposed to be knee-high on the average woman, but came up to the tops of Dasom\u2019s thighs, and her dress was terribly tucked into the shoes to make it work. Hoseok was walking behind her and holding her hands like she was a toddler learning how to walk again.\n\n\n\u201cRemember when she was three and she used to draw humans as circles with legs?\u201d Hoseok asked, grinning. \u201cBehold.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re awful,\u201d Jeongguk commented as Dasom stumbled again. Hoseok was dressed down significantly, wearing only a grey sweatsuit with a navy blue beanie covering his silver blonde short hair, but he was grinning mischievously, trying not to laugh.\n\n\n\u201cI like them!\u201d Dasom declared, beaming. \u201cI want a pair of these boots in my size!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot on your life, kid,\u201d Jeongguk replied calmly, and Hoseok snickered. Then he grabbed Dasom around the waist, pulled off each boot, and threw them to the floor until Dasom was without shoes once again.\n\n\n\u201cSay goodbye so Dad can go on his date,\u201d Hoseok encouraged, nudging Dasom between her shoulder blades. Dasom skipped up to Jeongguk and launched herself at him, so Jeongguk picked her up and hugged her tightly as she wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\n\n\u201cDo you want me to pick you up tonight or tomorrow?\u201d he quietly asked as he rubbed her back. Dasom rested her chin on Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder, and then she pulled away and stared at him. With one finger, she touched the two ends of Jeongguk\u2019s eyebrow piercing.\n\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d she whispered, and then she brought her pointer finger to Jeongguk\u2019s bottom lip and flicked it repeatedly to make a popping sound until she was giggling, because Jeongguk was just letting her do it. He opened his mouth and pretended to bite her finger, and she pulled away.\n\n\n\u201cIt might be late. So if they tell you to lie down and go to sleep, you\u2019ll do it. And I\u2019ll bring you home to your bed, okay?\u201d Jeongguk said, and Dasom nodded. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Dasom repeated, so Jeongguk pressed about eight or so kisses to her cheek before blowing a raspberry on it as she let out a yelp. \u201cStop it! Let me go, let me go. Fashion is my life, let me go.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve corrupted her,\u201d Jeongguk sighed as Dasom wiggled right out of his arms and bolted for Hoseok, snatching up the boots as she ran.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cJack-Jack, be a doll and put those back where they came from!\u201d Hoseok called out.\n\n\n\u201cOkay!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be here to pick her up,\u201d Jeongguk admitted, but Yoongi waved one hand dismissively.\n\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019ll be awake. You cool if we get delivery for dinner for her? She liked the ros\u00e9 jjimdak we got last time with the glass noodles. Might do that again,\u201d he said, tongue darting out to lick his bottom lip as Hoseok came to stand by his side.\n\n\n\u201cFeed her anything. Doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Jeongguk said, because he trusted Yoongi and Hoseok with his life, and with Dasom\u2019s life. Nowhere was Dasom safer than with Yoongi and Hoseok. \u201cI\u2019ll call when I\u2019m on my way to you guys.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave fun,\u201d Hoseok said with a grin, wrapping his arms around Yoongi\u2019s waist from behind. \u201cNothing too crazy. You look hot. Love the outfit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing the painting and drinking thing,\u201d Jeongguk said, and Yoongi hummed and nodded as Hoseok grinned. \u201cMy idea. Is it stupid?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s great,\u201d Hoseok said. \u201cGo, go, go. We\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk departed, ignoring the slight ache in his chest that always happened when he left Dasom with other people. He had assumed that such a feeling wouldn\u2019t last past a certain age, but Dasom was almost eight, and he still hated leaving her behind. \n\nSpend time by yourself! Be independent! Have a life all your own! \n\nBut even when he was doing that, Jeongguk still missed his daughter, no matter how much of a pain in the ass she was on her worst days.\n\n\nJeongguk drove to Jimin\u2019s apartment and hyped himself up based off of Hoseok\u2019s compliments. He was wearing black wide-legged pants and a white t-shirt with a few of his favorite necklaces, relieved that the weather was warm enough now for the end of April to forgo a jacket. It also gave him a chance to show his tattoos, which he only did because Jimin seemed to love them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nmood: \u201cshh...don\u2019t say it\u201d by fletcher\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHurry up!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cComing, coming,\u201d Jeongguk said as he slammed his car door shut and locked it. Then he jogged across the parking lot to where the other car was sitting and waiting\u2014their taxi, the car that would take them to the venue for painting and wine drinking. Jimin was standing there with a grin, wearing olive green linen pants and a white long-sleeved shirt as if he knew he was effortlessly gorgeous and barely had to lift a finger to knock the air out of Jeongguk\u2019s lungs.\n\n\nJimin had been a bit of an enigma to Jeongguk at first, but admittedly, having sex with him after that first date had answered a lot of Jeongguk\u2019s questions. Jimin was someone who spent most of his time in charge as a leader, teaching and mentoring and shaping lives. He had walked into their date with a touch of bravado, but the moment Jeongguk had started making his move, Jimin had caved almost instantly, happy to surrender.\n\n\nJeongguk had dated men and women alike, but no one had ever fit so perfectly into his life the way Jimin did. Jimin was lovely all the time. His intelligence was the sexiest thing about him; sitting on the floor at a coffee table and eating dinner together had been a revelation for Jeongguk, because he hadn\u2019t realized just how brilliant Jimin was until they had shared a real conversation. No matter what the topic, Jimin knew something about it. He was a true Libra, but he spoke with such passion about everything that Jeongguk knew he was dating the right man. \n\nThis \n\nwas the kind of man that could influence Dasom in a positive way.\n\n\nJeongguk had asked, too. He had asked Jimin point-blank what he thought about dating a guy with a seven-year-old. Asked for honesty. Asked for the brutal truth. And Jimin had said, without a semblance of a lie, that he had panicked initially but was warming up to the idea that maybe, just maybe, he was going to get to watch Dasom grow up. Five minutes later, he was sitting on Jeongguk\u2019s face, naked and moaning.\n\n\nSo maybe Jeongguk wasn\u2019t quite sure how to handle someone like Jimin.\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Jeongguk said breathlessly, jogging up and immediately taking Jimin\u2019s face between his hands to kiss him.\n\n\n\u201cYou look nice,\u201d Jimin said right away. \u201cAll these tattoos just to show the staff at this place what real art looks like?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just show them you,\u201d Jeongguk joked, and Jimin rolled his eyes, cupping his hand behind Jeongguk\u2019s neck for another kiss.\n\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t expecting to get another date so soon.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThank Hoseok for demanding that I give him Dasom for the night.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe needs her for some designs.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSend me pictures,\u201d Jimin said with a grin as he opened the door to the backseat of the car. After Jeongguk had apologized five consecutive times for sharing a picture of Dasom over text, Jimin had just started requesting the pictures so he could react accordingly. Never wanting to burden Jimin with it or force it onto him, Jeongguk had been a bit wary, but Jimin\u2019s affectionate reactions made him feel less guilty about someone else caring deeply for his daughter. Dasom hadn\u2019t seen Jimin since the end of her first grade school year, but it had only been two months. Jeongguk didn\u2019t want to rush anything. He wanted to ease Dasom into things if the relationship became more serious than it already felt.\n\n\nThe taxi dropped them off at the venue (Hollywood and Wine), and since Jeongguk had booked a slot for the two of them, they were welcomed inside and led to their easels. Then a staff member directed them to the bar, where they could choose what they wanted to drink.\n\n\n\u201cWell, if we\u2019re painting a war scene, I feel like red wine is the way to go. But what if I\u2019m supposed to paint you nude? That\u2019s a white wine scenario,\u201d Jimin said, tapping his finger against his bottom lip as Jeongguk snickered.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s springtime. A ros\u00e9 or sauvignon blanc would be good, right?\u201d he said, and Jimin turned the finger and pointed at Jeongguk.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re brilliant. Ros\u00e9?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGo for it.\u201d\n\n\nWith a glass of ros\u00e9 each, they made their way back to their easels, and they toasted with a kiss that they snuck when no one was looking. Jeongguk felt like a fool for a moment, but then he realized that he was just feeling lovesick. It wasn\u2019t that he was \n\nin love. \n\nNot yet. Or was he? He was staring love right in the face, sure, but he wasn\u2019t ready to admit that it was love. It felt too fast, or perhaps Jeongguk just had a shitty gauge for romance.\n\n\nThe art director declared that tonight\u2019s drawing would be a sunset over an ocean. Jeongguk gulped his wine down and carefully followed the instructions, glancing at Jimin\u2019s canvas every minute and reaching over with his paintbrush to dab paint onto Jimin\u2019s knuckles when he got the chance. Jimin silently scolded him, but when the rest of the class wasn\u2019t looking, Jeongguk leaned over and used the canvas and easel as a cover to steal kisses.\n\n\n\nI must be out of my damn mind.\n\n\n\nJeongguk typically used outings and dates as a means to fast intimacy, a quick fix so that he could go home to his daughter afterwards. Five years ago, Jeongguk had attempted a fleeting relationship with a man his age who had come to train at the gym. Only two months into it, Jeongguk had realized that it was just sex, and that he felt no connection, nor had he had any interest in introducing the guy to Dasom.\n\n\nJimin was at the two-month mark, and there was a connection. The sex was great\u2014Jeongguk couldn\u2019t deny that. But above all else, the quick fix of intimacy didn\u2019t leave him feeling empty. It made him want to come back for more, and it made him want to do things like paint a sunset and drink wine instead of dancing in a dark nightclub.\n\n\n\u201cMine is way better.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLIke hell it is.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI teach first grade,\u201d Jimin argued, and Jeongguk snorted with laughter. \u201cI\u2019m practically a professional artist. Look at that perspective.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour reflection on the water is average at best,\u201d Jeongguk lied.\n\n\n\u201cYour sunset looks sad.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs that an octopus in the water?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Jimin laughed, tossing back the last of his second glass of wine, paintbrush between his fingers as he drank with a smile on his face. Jeongguk watched him, enamored, admiring his profile, the way he licked his lips as he glanced at his own painting, the way he fixed his posture while sitting on the stool. Every little detail was a full story. Jeongguk could look at Jimin and see a future, the two of them curled up on the couch together with ice-cream and a movie. But he could also see Jimin tucking Dasom into bed at night, something that had never happened before.\n\n\nWith their paintings in their laps, the taxi took both of them back to Jimin\u2019s apartment, where Jeongguk\u2019s car was parked. Jeongguk dropped his painting off in his car, and then Jimin took his hand and dragged him towards the door, since it wasn\u2019t even ten o\u2019clock yet. Jeongguk went willingly, eagerly.\n\n\n\u201cShh, shh,\u201d Jimin said with a giggle, falling into Jeongguk\u2019s arms again as they approached the door of his apartment, his painting dragging. Jeongguk was already kissing him, tasting his lips like candy, hands all over. He wrapped one arm around Jimin\u2019s waist, the other hand massaging his scalp as he deepened the kiss, Jimin\u2019s hair tangled in his fingers. The door opened, and they both stumbled in and caught each other, the painting forgotten by the kitchen.\n\n\nSafe. There was a safety that came with being in Jimin\u2019s arms. They slowed down, standing rooted to the spot in the living room, kissing and touching as Jeongguk stroked Jimin\u2019s cheek with his thumb. With as much tenderness as he could muster up, Jeongguk brushed his lips along Jimin\u2019s jaw in feather-light kisses, and then up to his temple.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he whispered, and he felt the vibration of Jimin\u2019s laugh against his chest.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk.\u201d And then he set his lips back on Jeongguk\u2019s lips with intention.\n\n\n\u201cHyung,\u201d Jeongguk whispered dazedly, and Jimin hummed, his tongue still in Jeongguk\u2019s mouth, his hands fighting to get underneath Jeongguk\u2019s shirt.\n\n\n\u201cDo you have time?\u201d Jimin asked, pulling away and gazing at Jeongguk with affection.\n\n\n\u201cWhy? Did you want to have sex?\u201d Jeongguk asked, grazing his knuckles along Jimin\u2019s cheek as Jimin nodded. \u201cOkay. Bedroom.\u201d\n\n\nJimin pulled Jeongguk into his bedroom, and rather than tearing each other\u2019s clothes off, they stood at the foot of the bed and kissed slowly, carefully, undressing each other and taking time to touch. Jeongguk shivered when Jimin\u2019s thumbs brushed over his nipples.\n\n\n\u201cEver thought about getting more piercings?\u201d he asked, and Jeongguk snickered.\n\n\n\u201cThought about a lip piercing once,\u201d he admitted, and Jimin raised his eyebrows in interest. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want to scare Dasom. She was a toddler. Plus, she was always pulling my lips and smacking my face.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSounds about right,\u201d Jimin murmured, and then he grabbed Jeongguk as they both tumbled onto the bed, grabbing for lube and a condom and rolling until Jeongguk was propped upright against some pillows, and Jimin was in his lap.\n\n\n\u201cLike this?\u201d Jeongguk wondered, slicking up his fingers.\n\n\n\u201cI hate you,\u201d Jimin sighed, and Jeongguk let out a breathy laugh, raising one eyebrow. \u201cYou keep saying you want to bottom and here I am, begging for it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you trying to tell me that my dick is just \n\nthat \n\nmagical?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI might be, but don\u2019t let it go to your head,\u201d Jimin said, sighing out the last syllable as Jeongguk slipped his finger in with ease, and then a second one soon after. Jimin fell silent, draping himself over Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder and rolling his hips like he was riding Jeongguk\u2019s fingers, little breaths sweet and addictive in Jeongguk\u2019s ear. With one hand pressed to the curve of Jimin\u2019s back, Jeongguk left kisses all over Jimin\u2019s chest and collarbones.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really care how we do it,\u201d Jeongguk murmured between kisses. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m close to you like this. Love when it\u2019s like this. Love fucking you. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen like this,\u201d Jimin whispered, and Jeongguk nodded. Without a word, once Jimin was prepped enough, he knelt over Jeongguk\u2019s lap, lined himself up, and sank down onto Jeongguk\u2019s cock with a light sigh, eyes fluttering closed. He then draped his arms around Jeongguk\u2019s neck and moved in for a kiss.\n\n\nTime was lost. If there was a minute-hand ticking away, Jeongguk couldn\u2019t hear it. He kissed Jimin in slow, quiet waves with floating whispers in between, goosebumps on his skin whenever Jimin began to rock his hips just enough for Jeongguk to grow harder inside him again. They kissed with abandon, Jeongguk\u2019s hand loosely wrapped around Jimin\u2019s cock, neither of them in a rush, neither fighting for dominance, neither speaking. This cocoon was safe, and Jeongguk was starting to wonder if there was a cure for the lovesickness he was feeling.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nmood: \u201crumors\u201d by sabrina claudio, zayn\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJimin kept one arm over Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder and pressed the other hand behind him on Jeongguk\u2019s knee, breaking the kiss, and then he began to move fluidly, hips rolling, body glistening with a light sheen of sweat that made Jeongguk feel wild. He couldn\u2019t keep his hands from following the curves and planes of Jimin\u2019s beautiful body, couldn\u2019t keep from kissing every inch of exposed skin that was screaming out to him, couldn\u2019t keep from desperately absorbing every little moan or whimper that left Jimin\u2019s mouth.\n\n\nThis was much different than any other time they had had sex. Usually, Jeongguk walked into it with confidence and took the lead, knowing that Jimin liked being told what to do, that he liked the thrill of being denied or edged, enjoyed rough sex and dirty talk, was game for anything. But this was just\u2026 soft. Gentle. Quiet. It was sex with a purpose, but Jeongguk couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on it.\n\n\n\u201cTouch me,\u201d Jimin breathed, so Jeongguk began to stroke his cock again in a rhythmic fashion, watching the man riding him furrow his brow, bottom lip between his teeth. Gorgeous. He was so gorgeous, so \n\neffortlessly \n\nwonderful, and he wanted to be intimate with \n\nJeongguk, \n\nof all people.\n\n\n\u201cBaby, I\u2019m gonna come,\u201d Jimin whispered in warning, and Jeongguk nodded, his heart racing. \n\nBaby. \n\nWas he? Did Jimin feel that way outside of sex? And was it worth asking? Jeongguk swallowed heavily and massaged Jimin\u2019s thigh.\n\n\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he encouraged. \u201cI\u2019ve got you. Come on. Don\u2019t hold back. Come on, babe, come on. Let me see you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJeongguk,\u201d Jimin moaned, falling forward with his hands pressed to Jeongguk\u2019s chest, breathing heavily, eyes squeezed shut. He let out a sharp exhale that was more like a gasp, fingers curling until his nails were digging into Jeongguk\u2019s skin, and he came all over Jeongguk\u2019s hand and chest with a whimper. Jeongguk thought there would be a moment of peace or silence, but Jimin climbed out of Jeongguk\u2019s lap, laid Jeongguk on his back, and pulled the condom off so he could get his mouth on Jeongguk properly. Jeongguk\u2019s eyes rolled back as he sank into the pillows.\n\n\n\u201cGod, you\u2019re so good,\u201d he breathed, reaching down with one hand to rake his fingers through Jimin\u2019s hair. \u201cSo good, so\u2014shit, okay, okay. Just\u2014use your fingers, baby, use your\u2014that\u2019s it, \n\nshit, \n\nthat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk opened his eyes just to see Jimin hollowing his cheeks with his fingers wrapped around the base of Jeongguk\u2019s cock, and then he flicked his eyes up and stared at Jeongguk. With a few choice curse words, Jeongguk let his head hit the pillow again as he gripped Jimin\u2019s hair in warning, and then he lifted his hips up with a sharp exhale of pleasure as he spilled down Jimin\u2019s throat.\n\n\nThe clean-up was quick and silent, like a well-oiled machine doing its best work. Still naked, Jimin swung his leg over Jeongguk\u2019s lap and situated himself as if he had done it a thousand times, and Jeongguk ran his hands reverently up and down Jimin\u2019s ribs and settled at his hips. Jimin\u2019s right hand carded through Jeongguk\u2019s hair.\n\n\n\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d he whispered, and Jeongguk cocked his head.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUs. What are we doing?\u201d Jimin wondered. \u201cAre we\u2014are we \n\nsomething, \n\nor are we just\u2026? Is this just\u2026 What are we doing?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely something,\u201d Jeongguk replied without hesitation. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just fun or random to me. I\u2019m not killing time. I mean, at first, I thought maybe we both just wanted sex. But it\u2019s\u2026 I mean, we\u2019re clearly beyond that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you still want to keep seeing me?\u201d Jimin asked, and Jeongguk nodded, which made Jimin slump in visible relief. \u201cOh, okay. That\u2019s good. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m worrying so much. It just feels too good to be true.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy thoughts exactly,\u201d Jeongguk murmured with a small smile, glancing up to meet Jimin\u2019s eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what we\u2019re doing, to be honest. Enjoying each other\u2019s company, maybe. Learning. Having sex. Painting, although your painting could use some work.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole,\u201d Jimin laughed, smacking Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder lightly. Jeongguk grinned, and then he embraced Jimin and held him close, feeling Jimin\u2019s heartbeat against his own chest.\n\n\n\u201cHas work been okay?\u201d Jeongguk whispered, and he felt Jimin laugh quietly as they pulled apart, Jimin\u2019s fingernails scratched the bottom of Jeongguk\u2019s scalp with affection.\n\n\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s been good. Can\u2019t complain. I have a good class this year,\u201d he replied with a softness to his voice that made Jeongguk shiver happily. \u201cI like the series you\u2019re doing.\u201d He used his knuckles to trace along Jeongguk\u2019s jaw. \u201cOn Instagram. About posture and alignment.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh. That\u2019s nothing,\u201d Jeongguk said dismissively.\n\n\n\u201cI get to see you flexing all your muscles, so it\u2019s not \u2018nothing,\u2019\u201d Jimin said with a grin. \u201cBut it\u2019s good. People like it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOr maybe \n\nyou \n\njust like it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat, too.\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk gently gripped Jimin\u2019s chin and brought their lips together for a kiss, and then he smiled.\n\n\n\u201cI should get going,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. I promised Dasom I\u2019d get her tonight and not tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to let me see her one day soon, you know.\u201d Jimin pulled away further to survey Jeongguk\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s been months. She knows we\u2019re dating. I haven\u2019t seen her since she finished first grade.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll think of something,\u201d Jeongguk promised, and he meant it. It was time. He knew he was going to have to start incorporating Jimin into Dasom\u2019s life now, especially since he was head over heels for Jimin, in deep with no plans of escaping. Life was funny that way, but Jeongguk welcomed the chaos.\n\n\nAfter a flurry of goodbye kisses, Jeongguk reluctantly left Jimin\u2019s apartment, promising another date soon and begging Jimin to text him during the week. Jimin promised, so Jeongguk took the stairs down to the ground floor, giddy. Glad the alcohol had worn off, Jeongguk hopped into his car and drove right to Yoongi\u2019s and Hoseok\u2019s apartment, checking the time\u2014just after eleven o\u2019clock. It was a toss-up whether or not Dasom would be awake. She liked to push her limits when it came to bedtime.\n\n\n\u201c...Hey.\u201d Yoongi quietly opened the door when Jeongguk knocked. \u201cShe passed out an hour ago.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s shocking,\u201d Jeongguk admitted, stepping into the dimly lit apartment. Hoseok was sprawled on the couch, and he glanced up from his phone and waved. \u201cWas she good?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always good,\u201d Hoseok said as Yoongi gently pushed the door of their bedroom open. There, lying on the bed in the dark, was Dasom. She was curled into a fetal position and hugging a teddy bear that she kept at her uncles\u2019 place, and she was wearing a pair of pajamas that Jeongguk had put into her backpack.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou took her hair out,\u201d Jeongguk noticed when he peeked out into the living room again, and Hoseok nodded.\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want her sleeping with her hair tied up like that,\u201d he replied. \u201cNot good for her scalp.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt pays to have a fashion designer for an uncle,\u201d Jeongguk teased, and then he tiptoed back into the room. Dasom\u2019s beautiful hair was cascading down her back and over one shoulder, and she was sleeping peacefully, lower lip jutting out a bit, and Jeongguk just stared at her, his heart aching. Seeing her sleep just made him think of when she was a baby. He used to stand over her crib and watch her sleep just to make sure she was okay. Right after bringing her home from the hospital, Jeongguk used to sleep with her little bassinet right beside his bed, and he would lie with his fingertips on her small back sometimes so he could feel her breathing.\n\n\nGently, Jeongguk scooted his hands underneath Dasom\u2019s body, watching her frown and stir, but then he lifted her up and draped her over his right shoulder, his arm beneath her bottom to keep her supported. Dasom had said once that she didn\u2019t like being cradled when Jeongguk picked her up in the middle of her slumber because she felt \u201csquished,\u201d so now he carried her on one hip, her legs and arms dangling because she was too tired to wrap them around him. Jeongguk turned his head and kissed her hair several times.\n\n\n\u201cI love you, my baby,\u201d he whispered, and Dasom only let out a small hum, half-asleep. With one more kiss to her temple, Jeongguk walked out into the living room.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s her stuff,\u201d Yoongi whispered, slipping the backpack onto Jeongguk\u2019s left shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cThank you so much for looking after her,\u201d Jeongguk whispered as Yoongi rubbed Dasom\u2019s back. Hoseok hopped off the couch, gently brushed Dasom\u2019s hair away from her face, and kissed her forehead.\n\n\n\u201cAnytime,\u201d he said as Yoongi opened the front door. \u201cSee you later, Gguk-ah.\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk carried Dasom down to the car and cradled her head carefully as he set her down in the backseat. He was always prepared, so he grabbed the pillow that was in the backseat and propped it against the window by reaching through from the other side. He buckled Dasom in, watching her melt into the pillow, head lolling.\n\n\nTheir apartment was on the second floor of a smaller building, so Jeongguk carried her through the lit hallways and into their home, not bothering to flick on any lights. She wasn\u2019t wearing shoes, a perk of being carried, so he brought her right to her bedroom, but she whined quietly.\n\n\n\u201cWhat? What is it, darling?\u201d Jeongguk whispered, rubbing her back.\n\n\n\u201cDad\u2019s bed,\u201d she mumbled, nuzzling her face into Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder. She was almost eight and liked to pretend she was mature and \u201cover it,\u201d but whenever Dasom asked to sleep with Jeongguk in his bed, it meant that she needed to feel safe and loved, that somewhere along the line she had started to feel lonely or abandoned and just wanted her father. It didn\u2019t happen often, but Jeongguk never argued when she asked. He carried her into his bedroom and tucked her into the other side of his bed. But she called for him.\n\n\n\u201cWhat is it? Go to sleep, baby bear,\u201d he said, brow furrowed as he knelt down. Dasom, lying on her side, cracked her eyes open, still half-asleep.\n\n\n\u201cDate good?\u201d she murmured, her eyes closing.\n\n\n\u201cIt was great,\u201d he whispered, stroking her hair repeatedly so she could fall back asleep. She was quiet for a moment, but then she managed to say one more thing.\n\n\n\u201cYou love him?\u201d\n\n\nJeongguk paused as Dasom shifted underneath the covers further, eyes still closed. With a light touch, he used his fingertips to brush across her forehead and into her hair, watching her physically sink into the pillow as sleep began to take her over.\n\n\n\u201cI think I do,\u201d Jeongguk whispered. He saw Dasom\u2019s lips twitch in a smile, but then her face relaxed, and she said not another word. Jeongguk pressed a kiss to her forehead, wishing he could explain to her just how much he loved her. Instead, he let his actions do the work, and he changed into pajamas, washed up, and crawled into bed.\n\n\nSurely Dasom would want pancakes first thing in the morning. And Jeongguk was going to cook them for her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[moodboard by cata]\n\n\n~ ~ ~\n\n\u201cGod, I\u2019m so tempted to erase his answer and make it right.\u201d\n\u201cMy thoughts exactly.\u201d\n\u201cFill me up.\u201d\nJimin grabbed the bottle of wine and poured Seokjin another glass. They were sitting together at Seokjin\u2019s kitchen table, and both of them had math tests and spelling tests to grade, miraculously matching up with one another. So Seokjin had insisted that Jimin come over for a Sunday night drinking and grading session before handing back the results to students tomorrow.\nIt was nearly June, and the weather was warming up. Jimin was going on consistent dates with Jeongguk now, even dinner dates. Yesterday, Jeongguk had slept over because Dasom had been with her mother, and Jimin was still giddy thinking about the night they had spent together watching movies and having sex and ordering delivery food way too late at night but unable to resist temptation.\n\u201cThis kid can\u2019t spell to save her life. She tries so hard, poor girl,\u201d Seokjin sighed, shaking his head as he marked down yet another word on the paper before him. \u201cHer concept of consonants is all over the place.\u201d\n\u201cDid I have her?\u201d Jimin read the name upside down. \u201cAh, no. She wasn\u2019t my student.\u201d\n\u201cNo,  your students who I have now are good spellers,\u201d Seokjin said, rubbing his forehead. Then he tapped his red pen against the tabletop. \u201cHow was your date?\u201d\n\u201cIt was great.\u201d Jimin marked problem number three wrong on Miyeon\u2019s paper and flipped to the back. \u201cEvery date is good with him.\u201d\n\u201cIs this it, then?\u201d Seokjin grinned, kicking Jimin under the table. \u201cIs he the one? Are you gonna be a dad?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna be a dad,\u201d Jimin said crankily, trying not to laugh. \u201cI just\u2026 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\u201cDo you love him?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t exactly told him yet,\u201d Jimin replied. \u201cBut\u2026 I mean, I\u2019m not going to sit here and lie. I definitely think I\u2019m in love with him.\u201d\n\u201cIf he said he loved you, would you say it back?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cThere it is,\u201d Seokjin said in a singsong voice, laughing. \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought? You bang your student\u2019s father once and now look.\u201d\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t my student anymore,\u201d Jimin pointed out, grinning. \u201cTechnicalities matter, you know.\u201d\n\u201cYou got me there\u2014oh, just answer it. I don\u2019t care,\u201d Seokjin said when Jimin\u2019s phone began to vibrate and Jeongguk\u2019s name appeared. Jimin smiled, stood up with his wine glass in one hand, and pressed the phone to his ear with his other hand.\n\u201cYes, hello?\u201d\n\u201cHey, baby. How are you?\u201d Jeongguk asked, and Jimin smiled again, taking a sip of his wine.\n\u201cI\u2019m great. I\u2019m with a former co-worker right now. We\u2019re grading papers. He\u2019s the teacher I want Dasom to have for third grade,\u201d Jimin explained.\n\u201cAh, Kim Seokjin? Can we swing that?\u201d Jeongguk asked, and Jimin chuckled.\n\u201cAll we can do is hope. What\u2019s going on? Are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m good. I, uh\u2026 I wanted to ask you something,\u201d Jeongguk said, sounding hesitant, and Jimin noticed. He set his wine glass onto the table, held up one finger to Seokjin, and quietly walked into the other room.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cDasom\u2019s birthday is on the thirteenth of June,\u201d Jeongguk said, and Jimin hummed. \u201cUm, she\u2019s having a birthday party the day before on Saturday with all her friends from school and skating and everything. But, um\u2026 on Sunday, she\u2019s having a little party with just the adults. So, uh, that\u2019s me, my two friends who look after her all the time, my friend\u2019s sister, my older brother, and, uh\u2026 well, her mom and her mom\u2019s boyfriend will be there, too.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds awesome.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I was wondering\u2026 I was wondering if maybe you wanted to come on Sunday. To her birthday party,\u201d Jeongguk said in a rush, clearing his throat after. \u201cUh, she\u2019ll\u2014she\u2019ll be really\u2014yeah. She\u2019ll be really excited if you show up as a surprise. If you want to. No pressure. Everyone wants to meet you, though. No pressure, sorry, I just\u2014yeah. Even her mother wants to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Okay. Wow. That\u2019s\u2026 wow. That\u2019s\u2026\u201d Jimin took a deep breath. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Jeongguk, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA big step. I know. I get that.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to\u2014when I said that I should start seeing her, I\u2026 I thought maybe dinner or something,\u201d Jimin said, his heart racing nervously. \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2026 I wasn\u2019t expecting a birthday party.\u201d\n\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry, I just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there. Of course I\u2019ll be there,\u201d Jimin said as if he was scolding himself. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. But it\u2019s still\u2026 a lot to think about.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you\u2019ll really come?\u201d Jeongguk sounded pleasantly bewildered. \u201cAre you sure? I was ready to negotiate.\u201d\n\u201cNot necessary,\u201d Jimin said with a chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re asking me to meet all of the people who have basically raised her with you. And I\u2019m the new guy. It\u2019s a little scary. Terrifying, actually.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstood. But I\u2019ll be there with you,\u201d Jeongguk pointed out. \u201cAnd I trust you the same way I trust all of them. And Dasom will be over the moon.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get her a present,\u201d Jimin said, and Jeongguk let out a laugh.\n\u201cGod, that will boost her ego to impossible levels,\u201d he joked. \u201cDon\u2019t feel obligated. You\u2019re enough of a gift for her, trust me. Don\u2019t go all out.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get her something.\u201d\n\u201cAre you absolutely sure about this, hyung?\u201d Jeongguk asked cautiously.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure. I\u2019m\u2014yeah. I\u2019m terrified, but I\u2019m sure,\u201d Jimin said, resolute. \u201cI\u2019ll be there. Just tell me when and where.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll text you everything,\u201d Jeongguk said, sounding breathless with both relief and excitement, which made Jimin\u2019s heart skip happily. \u201cHave a good night, babe.\u201d\n\u201cYou too, Jeongguk-ah,\u201d Jimin said with affection, and then he hung up and ran back into the kitchen. \u201cHyung.\u201d\n\u201cDid he propose?\u201d Seokjin teased, and Jimin collapsed into his chair, grabbing his pen and tapping it a few times against his forehead as he leaned forward for a moment. Then he dropped his arms onto the table with a dull  thud. \n\u201cHe invited me to Dasom\u2019s birthday party. The one for adults.\u201d\n\u201cOh, shit. That\u2019s a huge step,\u201d Seokjin said, raising both eyebrows. \u201cYou feel okay with that? I mean, do you feel like your relationship is at that point?\u201d\n\u201cHyung.\u201d Jimin rubbed his face with his hands swiftly, and then he leaned back. \u201cI\u2019m in love with him. We\u2019ve established that, haven\u2019t we? So it  has to be at that point. There\u2019s no other option. I need to be a part of Dasom\u2019s life.\u201d\n\u201cAnd maybe tell Jeongguk you\u2019re in love with him, but I digress,\u201d Seokjin said with a coy shrug, setting one spelling test aside and reaching for the wine bottle. \u201cAnother glass?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me beg.\u201d\nJimin drank more wine and took a taxi home just like he had taken one to Seokjin\u2019s place, already anticipating the amount of wine they would drink together while grading papers. The entire fifteen-minute ride home, Jimin brainstormed furiously about what kind of gift he could give to an eight-year-old like Jeon Dasom.\nHe thought of it halfway through his week when he was in the middle of teaching his reading lesson. The kids were coloring in an illustration to match the story they had just read, and little Sooah marched up to Jimin\u2019s desk and extended her arm, frowning because there were marker streams all over it from her coloring escapades. It then dawned on Jimin exactly what to get Dasom, even if she had had it a million times before.\nThe thirteenth of June rolled around quickly, and Jeongguk texted Jimin the address and time to show up that morning with a heart emoji and everything. It was warm, since summer was approaching, and Jeongguk had insisted that Jimin wear casual clothing, nothing fancy. He had even sent Jimin a picture of himself in the mirror, wearing just a pair of ripped jeans and a black t-shirt. So Jimin (after he had finished drooling respectfully) opted for a similar fit, throwing on black jeans and a white t-shirt and then grabbing his present for Dasom that he had wrapped last night. His heart pounding nervously, he threw on his sunglasses and hopped into the car to drive to the park where Jeongguk had set up for them all to meet and hang out, since there would be dogs attending.\nThe weather was beautiful\u2014a good omen, Jimin figured. He tucked Dasom\u2019s present under one arm and locked his car, and then he scouted out the park before his eyes landed on a picnic table under a tree with a gold number 8 balloon and food spread across the table. There were two dogs chasing each other happily, and there was Dasom, standing on the bench of the picnic table as she attempted to be as tall as Jeongguk was during conversation. She was wearing a black sleeveless jumpsuit with a big black bow tied around her waist, and her long black hair was in two French braids. She wasn\u2019t wearing shoes, and Jimin wasn\u2019t even surprised.\n\n Okay, just walk up to them. It\u2019s just Jeongguk and eight other adults you\u2019ve never met before. You can do this. Don\u2019t be an idiot. \n\nJimin took a deep breath and stepped onto the grass to begin his walk towards the small party, but he didn\u2019t even make it halfway. He paused when Dasom stopped poking her finger in Jeongguk\u2019s ear and spotted him. She leapt off the bench and nearly face-planted, and then she began sprinting, not running, towards Jimin. When she reached him, she skidded to a halt, eyes wide and sparkling, mouth slightly open in shock.\n\u201cAre you here for my birthday?\u201d she practically whispered as if she couldn\u2019t believe Jimin was real.\n\u201cOf  course I\u2019m here for your birthday,\u201d Jimin replied, noticing the way that his heart grew five sizes like a cartoon when Dasom slapped both hands over her mouth, concealing her wild smile. Then she threw her arms around Jimin\u2019s waist and hugged him, her head pressed to his stomach, and Jimin laughed, hugging her back tightly.\n\u201cPark  seonsaengnim.\u201d \n\u201cYes\u2014oh.\u201d Jimin crouched down, because Dasom was furiously beckoning to him like she had a secret, so she scooted to his side so she could whisper in his ear.\n\u201cCan you tell my dad that you love him?\u201d she whispered, and then she pulled away and looked Jimin right in the eye as Jimin raised his eyebrows. Leaning in, Dasom added, \u201cI even asked him if he loves you, and he said he thinks so, but maybe he\u2019s scared. But if you say it first, maybe he won\u2019t be so scared.\u201d\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d Jimin gently asked, wanting to just hug her again for her shameless honesty and promotion of the relationship between Jimin and her own father. She was a rascal to the fullest extent, but the way that she looked after Jeongguk and took care of him in her own special way was devastatingly endearing. Dasom seemed to have a sixth sense, an intuition when it came to her father.\n\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded, her braids flopping, and then she grinned. One of her front teeth was growing in, but now she was missing the other front tooth and two on the bottom, and she was by far the most adorable child Jimin knew (perhaps he was biased). Dasom\u2019s eyes flicked down, and she saw the present. \u201cDid you bring me a present?\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\u201cIs it a good present?\u201d\n\u201cYah,\u201d Jimin scolded, lightly whacking her hip with the present as Dasom giggled. Jimin stood up so he could walk, but Dasom grabbed his hand and tugged.\n\u201cCome on, come on, come on. DAD! DAD, LOOK! LOOK, DAD, HE\u2019S HERE! DAD!\u201d\nJimin allowed himself to be pulled along towards the picnic table, trying not to blush or take off running when all eight adults turned to look at him in interest. Dasom marched right up to Jeongguk, and then she took Jeongguk\u2019s hand in her free hand. Without hesitating, she then smacked Jimin\u2019s hand into Jeongguk\u2019s hand before leaping away like they were on fire. She climbed onto the picnic table bench, stood up, took a giant step over the food, and landed on the other side next to a man with silver blonde hair.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Jeongguk said to Jimin, trying not to laugh but refusing to release Jimin\u2019s hand.\n\u201cOkay, now you have to kiss,\u201d Dasom said, elbows on the picnic table and both of her hands up like she was ready to cover her eyes. \u201cUgh, this is awful. Okay, kiss. Do it. I can take it.\u201d\n\u201cIs she serious?\u201d one of the women laughed as the guy next to Dasom snorted.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it called\u2014\u201d Dasom turned to the man next to her\u2014 \u201cwhen you make yourself watch something that\u2019s gross so that it\u2019s not as gross when you have to see it again?\u201d\n\u201cDesensitization,\u201d the man said, and Dasom just stared at him blankly. Then she whipped her head to look back at Jeongguk and Jimin.\n\u201cHow about I introduce him to everyone first, you fool?\u201d Jeongguk asked, and Dasom dramatically groaned, throwing her upper body onto the table. Chatter then broke out again amongst the laughter, and Dasom scooted closer to the man beside her, hooking her elbow with his as she watched Jimin set down the present onto the table with the others.\n\u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Jeongguk softly said, squeezing Jimin\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d\n\u201cI think it was a good surprise,\u201d Jimin said, and Jeongguk leaned in and gave him a quick kiss before guiding him over to the first person for Jimin to meet.\u00a0\n\u201cYOU DIDN\u2019T EVEN WARN ME!\u201d\n\u201cZip it,\u201d Jeongguk said to Dasom as the man beside her burst out laughing, because Dasom was kneeling on the bench indignantly with her hands pressed to the surface of the table. Jeongguk then gestured to the man with silver blonde hair, who stood up and offered his hand right away.\n\u201cJung Hoseok,\u201d he said with a contagious smile, and Jimin shook his hand.\n\u201cAh, the fashion designer. I have your clothes in my closet,\u201d Jimin said right away, and Hoseok grinned proudly. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this is his partner,\u201d Jeongguk added, turning Jimin towards a shorter, handsome man with black hair and an undercut and captivating eyes. He offered his hand as well.\n\u201cMin Yoongi,\u201d he introduced himself as they shook hands. \u201cAbout time we finally meet you. Every other word out of Jeongguk\u2019s mouth is your name.\u201d\n\u201cYou zip it, too,\u201d Jeongguk said, clamping his fingers together like a mouth as Jimin snickered.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to meet you both,\u201d he said. Hoseok then grabbed Dasom around the waist and made her sit down and settle as she scowled, and Jeongguk guided Jimin over to the next couple. Jimin met Jeongguk\u2019s older brother, Junghyun, and his wife and their dog. He then met Hoseok\u2019s older sister, Jiwoo, and her husband and their dog.\u00a0\n\u201cAh, this is Byun Daeseong,\u201d Jeongguk said, introducing Jimin to a tall man in jeans and a graphic t-shirt with a baseball cap on. He shook Jimin\u2019s hand as Jimin noticed Jeongguk glancing around the park brow furrowed.\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Daeseong said, shifting his footing nervously. \u201cUh, I heard you\u2019re a great teacher.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Thank you,\u201d Jimin replied with a small bow, mildly confused. He was about to ask how Daeseong knew such things, but a hand patted Daeseong\u2019s chest and pushed him away, and Jeongguk put a hand on Daeseong\u2019s shoulder and guided him off.\n\u201cPlease excuse my boyfriend. He doesn\u2019t know how to socially interact with people older than him.\u201d The hand belonged to a woman who was smiling in amusement, and then she bowed. \u201cKim Eunji. I\u2019ve been waiting to meet you.\u201d\nNow Jimin understood why Dasom was so tiny for her age. Eunji was petite, short enough for Jimin to rest his chin on the top of her head. Her long black hair was pulled up into a high ponytail, and she was wearing a red sundress, her sunglasses pushed up into her hair. Dasom didn\u2019t look much like Eunji, most of her looks coming from Jeongguk, but Eunji was quite pretty with a fairy-like type of beauty, sitting into one hip casually and not bothering to hold herself in a prim and proper fashion, arms crossed. Jimin could see the family resemblance, mostly in posture. Eunji seemed small but mighty, much like Dasom was.\n\u201cOnce a month for an entire school year\u2014\u2018Hi, Dasom, how are you?\u2019 And then I\u2019d get\u2014\u2018Mom, I have the best teacher. Mom, Park  seonsaengnim said that I\u2019m smart. Mom, what star sign are you if you\u2019re born in October?\u2019\u201d Eunji said, having a pretend conversation with herself as Jimin stifled his laughter. Eunji grinned. \u201cThat last one isn\u2019t made up. She wanted to do a Naver search on how compatible you were with Jeongguk.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s ambitious, if nothing else,\u201d Jimin said with fondness, and then he offered his hand, which Eunji shook politely. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to finally meet you. Jeongguk has said good things about you.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s very nice of him,\u201d Eunji replied, tightening her ponytail as she watched the scene at the picnic table. Jeongguk was sitting on the edge talking to Dasom, who was quite animated as she spoke, hand gestures and all. \u201cDasom says you\u2019re the best ever. I believe her.\u201d\n\u201cI think she\u2019s exaggerating.\u201d\n\u201cI doubt that. She\u2019s brutally honest. Last month, she told me that I shouldn\u2019t marry Daeseong because I\u2019m \u2018better than that,\u2019\u201d Eunji said, using air quotes as Jimin snorted with laughter in disbelief. \u201cThat girl doesn\u2019t sugarcoat anything. I don\u2019t know whether to be mortified or impressed. But that\u2019s how Jeongguk is, too, so I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\n\u201cShe came up to my desk in the middle of class once and said that her dad thinks I\u2019m cute and asked if I thought  he was cute,\u201d Jimin remarked, and Eunji snickered. \u201cShe\u2019s got spunk.\u201d\n\u201cShe does. But there\u2019s something else I\u2019ve noticed,\u201d Eunji said, sitting into the other hip. \u201cAnd feel free to stop me if I\u2019m being too forward or disrespectful. But\u2026 about Jeongguk.\u201d\n\u201cMm?\u201d Jimin slipped his thumbs into the front pockets of his jeans and shifted to face Eunji more, curious.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been with Daeseong for\u2026 five years now? Give or take,\u201d Eunji began, her arms still crossed delicately. \u201cAnd I always kind of hoped Jeongguk would find someone, you know? I get that it was easier for me.  Everything was easier for me. He\u2019s the one who raised her. I don\u2019t really have a leg to stand on. And he\u2019s had his friends and everything. But I wanted him to have someone like you. This is probably the happiest I\u2019ve seen him since Dasom was born.\u201d\nJimin nodded quietly, not sure what to say. It was bizarre, hearing Eunji speak so freely about Jeongguk, hearing that she wanted Jeongguk to have good things and wasn\u2019t bitter about anything that happened in the past. Jimin was so used to the horror stories of the internet about scorned exes locked in custody battles or jealousy over new partners. Yet here Eunji was, smiling over Jeongguk\u2019s newfound happiness.\u00a0\n\u201cHe deserves this. If you\u2019re gonna stick around,\u201d Eunji added with a grin. \u201cHe really likes you. I asked him last time he picked up Dasom, and he even said so.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t really say I expected to date the single father who left his number in his kid\u2019s end-of-the-year thank you card,\u201d Jimin said, and Eunji giggled. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad he did. I just have to make sure Dasom likes me as much as he does.\u201d\n\u201cShe idolizes you,\u201d Eunji assured Jimin. \u201cBut that\u2019s why Jeongguk likes you so much. Because you like his kid.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good father,\u201d Jimin softly said as he watched Jeongguk lift Dasom up and over his head so that she was sitting on his shoulders, her hands grabbing his hair instinctively. Eunji clicked her tongue and shook her head.\n\u201cNo, no. He\u2019s a  great  father. I\u2019m not going to win any awards for being the world\u2019s best mother. I\u2019m far from it. I don\u2019t really have it in me, that mother\u2019s intuition thing people talk about. I learned to be okay with that. But Jeongguk is  amazing at being a father,\u201d Eunji praised, and then she smiled. \u201cSorry about all of this. Pretty weird first conversation to have with someone.\u201d\n\u201cNot really, given the circumstances,\u201d Jimin replied with a shrug. \u201cI was nervous about this. Big step. Didn\u2019t think I was ready for it. Never really considered being any kind of father figure. But\u2026\u201d Jimin fixated on Jeongguk with Dasom, finally realizing that he wasn\u2019t frantic or panicked anymore at the prospect of being added to their little bubble. \u201cI love him. Which means that I need to love her just as much. Guess I can only hope that I do a good job.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you have anything to worry about,\u201d Eunji said cheerfully, and then she scooted just a little to the side as Dasom, now off Jeongguk\u2019s shoulders, came dashing over, throwing her arms around Jimin\u2019s waist without warning.\n\u201cPark  seonsaengnim,\u201d she said breathlessly.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get you to call me something else,\u201d Jimin laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not your teacher anymore, you know.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll work on it,\u201d Dasom said like an adult, and Jimin snickered. \u201cDad says he\u2019s going to cut the cake for me after we sing. Do you want cake?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I want cake.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but you can\u2019t kiss Dad if you help him with it,\u201d Dasom said, and Eunji snickered. \u201cI don\u2019t want my cake to be poisoned.\u201d\n\u201cYah, don\u2019t be so dramatic,\u201d Eunji scolded good-naturedly, and Dasom looked up at her mother and pulled a disgusted face before she took Jimin\u2019s hand and yanked. Jimin held her back for a moment, glancing over his shoulder at Eunji.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said with gratitude. \u201cFor everything. The conversation. All of it.\u201d\n\u201cI have a feeling it won\u2019t be the only time we get to talk,\u201d Eunji said with a sparkle in her eyes. Jimin smiled, and then he allowed Dasom to pull him over to the small folding table that Jeongguk had brought, where a cake was in a box waiting.\u00a0\n\u201cDad, I brought you someone!\u201d Dasom announced giddily, and then she ran off to the picnic table.\n\u201cShe\u2019s very excited about all of this,\u201d Jeongguk said as he used an elbow to nudge the box to the side after lifting the cake out. Jimin helped by setting the box beneath the table, and then he slipped one arm around Jeongguk\u2019s waist.\n\u201cWell, rightfully so. It\u2019s  her party,\u201d he pointed out, and Jeongguk snickered, grabbing the candles so he could arrange them on the cake.\n\u00a0\n\n  mood: \u201csweettalk my heart\u201d by tove lo  \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did Eunji say to you?\u201d he asked as he began placing the candles carefully. He was trying to mask it, but Jimin could hear the concern in his voice, as if he was worried that the conversation hadn\u2019t gone well.\n\u201cThat you\u2019re a great father.\u201d\nJeongguk stuck the last candle into the cake and pursed his lips, turning to face Jimin.\n\n If you say it first, maybe he won\u2019t be so scared. \n\n\u201cAnd that you\u2019re happy,\u201d Jimin continued as he recalled Dasom\u2019s words, seeing the smile slowly creep onto Jeongguk\u2019s face. \u201cAnd I agreed. That you\u2019re a great father. I told her that now I just need to work on loving Dasom as much as I love you.\u201d\nJeongguk\u2019s eyes visibly widened for a moment, and then his expression softened as he lifted his knuckles to graze along Jimin\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou really love me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I love you.\u201d\nJeongguk leaned in and kissed Jimin sweetly, brushing their noses together with a smile. \u201cI love you, too. I love you so much. I want you to be a part of Dasom\u2019s life, hyung. And mine, but that\u2019s a given. Will you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Jimin stated, smiling. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be here for all her other birthdays, too. If you want me to be. Also, I\u2019m really great with decorating cakes.\u201d\n\u201cDamn it. Should\u2019ve asked you first,\u201d Jeongguk sighed in fake disappointment, and then he grinned while reaching for the lighter as Jimin nudged him. \u201cI\u2019m glad my kid bitch-slapped that mean girl. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have met the way we did.\u201d\n\u201cYou definitely wouldn\u2019t have shown up for that parent-teacher conference.\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Jeongguk agreed, and they both laughed together as Jeongguk flicked the lighter. He quickly lit the candles, and then he kissed Jimin\u2019s cheek and picked up the cake.\n\u201cI SAID NO KISSING NEAR MY CAKE!\u201d\n\u201cYah, will you pipe down and let them have a moment?\u201d Hoseok scolded loudly as Yoongi grabbed Dasom around the waist and held her up in the air to keep her from running. She pretended to run in mid-air as Jeongguk\u2019s brother laughed and Eunji shook her head with a smile.\n\u201cHappy birthday to yo-o-o-ou\u2026\u201d\nJimin spotted Jeongguk as he carried the cake, ready to catch it in case it wobbled from its precarious perch. Jeongguk slid the cake right in front of Dasom, and Dasom beamed as everyone sang for her. Then she blew out the candles after making a wish, leapt off the bench, and ran right into Jeongguk\u2019s arms. Hoseok was the one who took the knife and began to cut up slices of cake as Jeongguk insisted that Dasom needed birthday kisses equal to her age, which made her fake-gag in horror as she tried to pull away, giggling. Jimin caught her eye and crooked one finger at her, so she scurried out of Jeongguk\u2019s arms and over to Jimin, who sat down on the bench backwards so Dasom was eye-level with him.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not scared anymore,\u201d Jimin whispered to her, and Dasom\u2019s eyes bugged in disbelief.\n\u201cYou told him?\u201d she hissed, delighted. Jimin nodded. \u201cYou said you love him?\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\u201cDid he say it back?\u201d\n\u201cHe did.\u201d\nDasom climbed onto the bench and threw her arms around Jimin\u2019s neck sideways. Jimin hugged her back tightly, once again remembering that months ago, Namjoon and Taehyung had warned him that dating Jeongguk was a two-for-one deal. Without fail, Jimin loved Jeongguk to the fullest extent, unconditionally. He had fallen in love quickly, unexpectedly, so beautifully. But Dasom had stolen Jimin\u2019s heart first, and long ago. She had already made herself comfortable, so now it was just as if she was coming home. Jimin had held himself back from caring for her more than any of his other students. Now he didn\u2019t have to hold back.\n\u201cHappy birthday, Dasom-ah. I love you,\u201d he whispered to her. Dasom\u2019s arms tightened around his neck, and she refused to let go even when Jeongguk said that her piece of cake was ready. Jimin continued to embrace her, catching Jeongguk\u2019s eye and smiling when he saw the look on Jeongguk\u2019s face. Hoseok clapped Jeongguk on the shoulder, Eunji rubbed Jeongguk\u2019s back as she walked by to grab a piece of cake, and finally, Jeongguk smiled, visibly suppressing emotion.\n\u201cI\u2019m eating your piece of cake,\u201d Jimin hissed, and Dasom instantly pulled off Jimin and threw her body in front of his.\n\u201cNo! Where\u2019s my cake? Dad! He\u2019s gonna steal it!\u201d\nDasom secured her piece of cake, and she slid Jimin his own plate. They all sat around the picnic table together, two dogs at their feet playing, and even while the adults talked, Dasom injected herself right into the conversation with absolutely no qualms about doing so. She was respectful but bold, forever curious and prone to asking questions. She kept looking between Jeongguk and Jimin with a toothless grin, proud of her handiwork, pleased with how her master plan had all come together in the end.\n\u201cOkay, presents for the birthday girl!\u201d Jeongguk declared, and then he picked Dasom up and plopped her on the picnic table so she could sit cross-legged where everyone could see her. As she tore into the first present, Jimin glanced around and noticed immediately that almost everyone was watching her with heart eyes and fond smiles, watching Jeongguk stand behind her and reach over to help if unwrapping the present was too difficult.\n\n It takes a village. \n\nJimin had never really given much thought to what it took to raise a child, only resigning himself to having a general idea as a first grade teacher. But seeing Dasom surrounded by a handful of people who had held her as an infant, changed her diapers, taught her certain words or phrases, cooked her breakfast, attended her birthday parties\u2014it was a stark realization, humbling. Dasom was the product of the people who had raised her, and that meant that she was, first and foremost, a reflection of Jeongguk.\n\u201cNo way! No way, no way! Dad! Dad, look! Look!\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d Jeongguk laughed, moving the wrapping paper aside and glancing up at Jimin. Jimin had gotten Dasom a DIY tattoo kit with hundreds of different design options, and she was already flipping eagerly through the the sheets in awe, jaw dropped, eyes alight with excitement as she wiggled back and forth while perusing the choices. Jeongguk bent down and whispered in her ear.\n\u201cYou got this for me?\u201d Dasom exclaimed, looking up at Jimin.\n\u201cBetter than drawing on your arms with markers,\u201d Jimin said, and Dasom giggled, hugging the present to her chest.\n\u201cThank you. It\u2019s my favorite,\u201d she said without hesitation.\n\u201cWhat are we, chopped liver?\u201d Yoongi complained in good spirits, and Dasom grinned with absolutely no shame, holding up a page of the tattoos and showing it to Jeongguk because there was a tiger, and Jeongguk also had a tiger on his arm somewhere.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do it over summer break,\u201d Jeongguk promised her quietly. \u201cYou can\u2019t have them on your skin at school, sweetheart. Over summer. We\u2019ll tattoo you up wherever you want.\u201d\nDasom pawed through her presents in her own little world for the next ten minutes, and that gave Jimin more time to mingle. He spoke more to Hoseok and Yoongi, and Hoseok promised Jimin a few free outfits while Jimin shamelessly plugged Taehyung, saying that Taehyung was a phenomenal photographer. Hoseok took one glance at Taehyung\u2019s Instagram page and begged for a contact number, which Jimin happily provided. Jimin then scooted over to talk more to Eunji, who told him funny stories about when she had first babysat Dasom and had had no clue what to do.\n\u201cI walked into the room and this girl was hanging headfirst over the railing of her crib. Just hanging! Not falling or anything. She was just giggling and hanging there with her bottle in her mouth, dropping her stuffed animals one by one out of her crib and onto the floor.\u201d\nJimin made it to Jeongguk, who embraced him and kissed the side of his head while Dasom was busy chasing Yoongi around the picnic table.\n\u201cI want to see you this weekend,\u201d Jeongguk murmured between kisses, wrapping Jimin up and turning them away from the rest of the group.\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I love you.\u201d Another kiss. Jimin smiled. \u201cAnd Dasom\u2019s happy. And I don\u2019t want anything else in my life right now except to be with you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I asked for real personal training sessions? That don\u2019t involve sex by the weights.\u201d\n\u201cDone. For free. Whenever you want,\u201d Jeongguk declared. \u201cYou can train with me. Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights. Dasom\u2019s at violin lessons and ice skating those nights. Come train with me.\u201d\n\u201cDeal. I love you, too,\u201d Jimin added, arms around Jeongguk\u2019s neck as they kissed again. He was going to go for one more, but then a small body smacked into his thigh, and Dasom wiggled between the two of them, clinging to Jimin.\n\u201cHide me!\u201d she hissed. \u201cStop kissing and  hide me!\u201d \n\u201cJEON DASOM!\u201d\n\u201cShh! I\u2019m not here!\u201d Dasom insisted, because Yoongi was searching for her.\n\u201cShe\u2019s definitely not over here!\u201d Jeongguk called out.\n \u201cDad, you suck!\u201d Dasom hissed, and then she looked up at Jimin. \u201cSave me!\u201d\n\u201cFound her!\u201d Jimin picked Dasom up and threw her over one shoulder, and Dasom let out a shriek, kicking her legs and smacking Jimin on the back repeatedly. Jimin grabbed one of Dasom\u2019s ankles in his right hand and the other in his left, and then he dangled her behind his back as Dasom giggled, her fingertips grazing the grass.\n\u201cAbsolutely no idea where she is,\u201d Yoongi joked.\n\u201cMe neither,\u201d Jimin said with a shrug. \u201cHave you checked my backpack?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, no, no!\u201d Dasom flailed, so Jimin lowered her until her hands touched the grass, and she cartwheeled out of it and sprinted off, laughing and calling for Yoongi to chase her. Jeongguk walked up to Jimin\u2019s side, and Jimin crossed his arms.\n\u201cHope that didn\u2019t scare her,\u201d he commented, and Jeongguk snorted.\n\u201cOh, trust me. That was about a two out of ten on the scale of what scares her. You fit right in.\u201d\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere are rules.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what are the rules?\u201d\nDasom set her hands on her hips and stood right in front of Jimin. She was wearing her  Iron Man pajamas now, her hair down and damp. Jimin motioned for her to sit, so she sat down on the floor between Jimin\u2019s legs as he sat on the couch, and then he began to comb through her wet hair meticulously.\n\u201cYou sleep on the couch.\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, fine. Then if you\u2019re sleeping in the same bed as him, no kissing. And you have to wear all your clothes,\u201d Dasom declared, and Jimin snorted with laughter, gently settling one hand on the top of Dasom\u2019s head to work the comb through a small tangle. It was July, the beginning of summer vacation, and for the first time, Jimin was sleeping over at Jeongguk\u2019s apartment on a Saturday night. Dasom had been hyper and wired all night, and now she was showered and ready for bed, trying to maintain her energy even though she was crashing fast. They had eaten pizza for dinner and they had played a game, just the three of them.\n\u201cOkay. Fully clothed. Can\u2019t promise the no kissing thing,\u201d Jimin admitted, making sure the middle part in Dasom\u2019s hair was still straight.\n\u201cAre you bargaining?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m telling him the rules,\u201d Dasom retorted as Jeongguk walked into the living room, tucking his phone away and plopping down on the adjacent couch. \u201cYou can hear them, too.\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cI tried to keep him on the couch, but he said he\u2019s sleeping with you,\u201d Dasom sighed, and she giggled when Jeongguk threw a pillow at her face. \u201cSo I said no kissing and you have to wear a shirt, Dad.\u201d\n\u201cYour rules suck,\u201d Jeongguk said, and Jimin burst out laughing as Dasom threw the pillow back at him. \u201cIt\u2019s almost eleven o\u2019clock, you little demon. Come on. We need to blow-dry your hair.\u201d\n\u201cJiminie  samchon.\u201d Dasom twisted her upper body. \u201cWill you blow-dry my hair?\u201d\n\u201cYah, he\u2019s not here to be your personal assistant,\u201d Jeongguk said, but Jimin grabbed Dasom underneath her arms and hoisted her up as he stood.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it tonight, it\u2019s fine,\u201d he said, and Dasom beamed proudly.\n\u201cOkay, this way! I\u2019ll show you everything!\u201d She took off running towards the bathroom, disappearing around the corner, and Jeongguk grabbed Jimin\u2019s wrist to stop him. Jimin immediately bent with his hands pressed to the armrest and kissed Jeongguk at his request.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do any of this,\u201d Jeongguk whispered.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing it so that she trusts me and knows that I  can do it,\u201d Jimin whispered back with a second kiss. \u201cI love you. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\u201cLove you, babe,\u201d Jeongguk said softly with a smile. Jimin then walked into the bathroom, where Dasom had pulled out the hair dryer and was holding it carefully. She offered it to Jimin, who plugged it in and turned it on, grabbing for the brush that was on the countertop. Dasom then stood and stared in the mirror as Jimin began to dry her hair section by section, Dasom chewing absentmindedly on a hair-tie. Jimin grabbed another section of her hair, held it between his fingers that were around the dryer, and used his other hand to lightly smack Dasom\u2019s hand. Sheepish, she took the hair-tie out of her mouth and pursed her lips, trying not to laugh.\n\u201cDone.\u201d Jimin turned off the dryer and unplugged it, running his fingers through Dasom\u2019s dry, silky hair. \u201cDo you need to brush your teeth and wash up?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d Dasom said, reaching for the toothbrush as Jimin tucked away the dryer. He then switched places with Jeongguk so that Jeongguk could see Dasom off to bed, tucking her in and kissing her goodnight. Dasom hollered for Jimin, though, and she asked him to tuck her in and give her a kiss goodnight. It was absolutely a test, because she had the covers pulled up to her nose and she was halfway in a fetal position, but Jimin wasn\u2019t going to let her get away with it. He marched into her room, tucked her in too much until she was giggling, and then kissed the top of her head, which was the only part left of her still exposed.\n\u201cGoodnight, Dasom-ah.\u201d\n\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Dasom said, voice muffled by the blankets. Jeongguk flicked off the light and closed the door, and the moment he did, he grabbed Jimin around the waist and swept him away towards his bedroom, kissing him as Jimin quietly laughed.\n\u00a0\n\n  mood: \u201cfeels\u201d by kehlani  \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot with your eight-year-old daughter in the next room,\u201d he hissed, and Jeongguk snickered.\n\u201cPoint taken. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t kiss you.\u201d\nAnd they kissed. They kissed until Jimin felt like his lips were swollen, until he was sitting on the bed with Jeongguk kneeling in his lap, hands tangled in Jimin\u2019s hair. Jeongguk sighed in frustration, dropping his forehead against Jimin\u2019s.\n\u201cFuck, I\u2019m so horny,\u201d he complained, and Jimin suppressed a laugh. \u201cThis is going to be harder than I thought.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll suck you off later if you\u2019re quiet.\u201d Jimin whispered his promise against Jeongguk\u2019s lips, and Jeongguk devoured it with another kiss, humming in agreement. It was just a trial run, after all\u2014Jeongguk had been nervous to even ask Jimin to sleep over for the night, but Jimin hadn\u2019t even hesitated to say yes. Jeongguk\u2019s primary fear was exposing Dasom to too much too quickly, spooking her to a point where she would feel wary of Jimin\u2019s presence at their house. But when he had asked Dasom for her opinion, Dasom had immediately delighted in the prospect of Jimin being at their house when she woke up in the morning. Always one step ahead and highly intelligent, she had also told Jeongguk, apparently, that one Saturday she had slept over at Eunji\u2019s place and Daeseong had just been there, all moved in permanently. So Jimin doing a test run was nothing.\n\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d Jeongguk whispered when they were finally lying in the dark, and Jimin was straddling Jeongguk\u2019s hips with the blankets over them. Jeongguk hadn\u2019t bothered with a shirt, and now Jimin was horny, too. \u201cAm I still the hot single dad with the motorcycle, or am I boring now?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re never boring,\u201d Jimin murmured, hands still wandering Jeongguk\u2019s body. \u201cEvery time we have sex, it\u2019s something different. And you\u2019re still hot as hell. Always will be. When I first told my friend about you, he said you were a D-I-L-F.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m honored.\u201d Jeongguk snickered. \u201cDo I get to say that about you, too?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a dad.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about whether or not you\u2019re an  actual dad. It\u2019s an energy. Being a D-I-L-F is a vibe,\u201d Jeongguk declared, and Jimin hid his laughter by dropping his head into Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder for a moment. \u201cDo I give off that vibe?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\u201cMission accomplished.\u201d\nJimin wasn\u2019t quite sure when they drifted off to sleep. He definitely remembered the two of them lying facing one another while Jeongguk quietly jerked them both off, and he remembered Jeongguk getting up to wash his right hand clean after that. But the next time Jimin woke up, there was daylight streaming through the window, and he could hear whispers.\n\u201cMm-mm.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Sunday.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d\n\n \u201cDad.\u201d \n\n\u201cMm.\u201d\nThere was a moment of silence, and the Jimin heard the quiet patter of feet. Seconds later, a small hand shook his arm.\n \u201cPst!\u201d Dasom patted him again. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d\n\u201cMhm.\u201d Jimin slowly rolled onto his back and opened his eyes. Dasom was standing at the edge of the bed, hair a bit wild from sleep, but she was wide awake and practically bouncing in anticipation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Sunday. I want to make pancakes,\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cDasom-ah,\u201d Jeongguk croaked, but he said nothing else. Dasom blinked at Jimin hopefully, and then she threw her entire upper body over the blankets and right onto Jimin\u2019s chest. Jimin wrapped his arms around her small frame and stroked her hair as she turned her head to the side quietly.\n\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d Jimin asked, and Dasom nodded against his chest. \u201cIs it okay that I\u2019m still here?\u201d She nodded again. \u201cShould we let Dad sleep while we make pancakes?\u201d\n\u201cYes. With blueberries. I know where everything is,\u201d Dasom whispered, eyes twinkling.\n\u201cMm. Let me wash up first.\u201d\nDasom leapt away from the bed and skipped out of the room, and Jimin could hear her moving things around in the kitchen as he rolled out of bed with a yawn. Jeongguk was fast asleep again, face buried in his pillow, and Jimin knew he was near impossible to wake up, so he tiptoed out of the room to find Dasom pulling out a stepping stool.\n\u201cThe pancake mix is up high,\u201d she said as she pointed in the pantry, so Jimin grabbed it and brought it down for her. \u201cI know the directions by heart because Dad makes pancakes with me every Sunday.\u201d\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s hear it, then,\u201d Jimin said. \u201cAre you measuring things?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and I can mix,\u201d Dasom proudly said. \u201cCan you\u2014\u201d She used a rough hand to push hair out of her eyes. \u201cCan you do my hair for me while I mix?\u201d\n\u201cOh. Uh\u2026 Yeah, hold on. Let me go get a hair-tie,\u201d Jimin said, and he hurried into the bathroom and grabbed a few hair-ties to put around his wrist, as well as a brush. Then he stood behind Dasom and brushed her hair smooth before pulling it up into a ponytail. If there was one thing he knew how to do as a first grade teacher, it was how to tie up a girl\u2019s hair. So he put another hair-tie a quarter of the way down Dasom\u2019s ponytail, one halfway down, and one at the end to create sections as Dasom began to mix everything together with care, holding the bowl to keep it from moving as she did.\n\u201cOkay, hot pan\u2026 some butter\u2026\u201d Jimin gestured. \u201cDo you use a ladle?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Dad pours it into the mixing cup so I can pour it into the pan,\u201d Dasom explained, so Jimin used a spatula to put the batter into the mixing cup as Dasom held the bowl responsibly. Then, giggling at Jimin\u2019s constant stream of \u201ccareful, careful, careful, careful,\u201d Dasom poured the batter into the pan.\n\u201cLook, a mini pancake,\u201d Jimin said, pointing to the tiny dot of batter near the edge of the pan. \u201cThat\u2019s yours. Can we fit a blueberry onto it?\u201d\n\u201cRude,\u201d Dasom said, holding up the spatula with both hands like it was a sword. Then she smacked it onto the countertop and grabbed the blueberries. \u201cHow many blueberries?\u201d\n\u201cSeventy-four.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a pancake anymore,\u201d Dasom said with a giggle, and Jimin sighed.\n\u201cOkay, fine. Seventy-three.\u201d\nDasom turned on the stepping stool and used gentle little fists to repeatedly pound at Jimin\u2019s chest. She was using absolutely no force, but the mere fact that she felt comfortable enough with Jimin to pretend to use him as a punching bag spoke volumes.\u00a0\nThe blueberries went into the pancake, and Jimin then suggested that they flip it like the chefs do. Dasom nearly fell off the stepping stool in excitement, and then she wiggled until she was right in Jimin\u2019s arms, her back to his chest, both hands on the handle of the pan. Jimin stood behind her with his hands over hers and explained the motion to her, and she nodded fervently like she was training for the Olympics.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay. One\u2026 two\u2026 three!\u201d\n\u201cYA-A-A-A-A-AH!\u201d Dasom cheered the moment the pancake flipped perfectly and landed in the pan. She threw her arms up victoriously as Jimin took her by the waist and lifted her up towards the ceiling, and then he heard applause, so he turned with Dasom in his arms towards the sound.\n\u201cBrilliant. Show-stopping. Spectacular. Judges give it a ten out of ten.\u201d Jeongguk grinned sleepily, and Dasom ran over when she saw that Jeongguk had his phone out. \u201cGot it on video and everything.\u201d\n\u201cLet me see!\u201d Dasom exclaimed, reaching for his phone.\n\u201cYah, you have pancakes to cook,\u201d Jeongguk said, shooing her back towards her cooking. Dasom giggled and leapt back up onto the stepping stool just in time to slide the pancake out of the pan and onto a plate. Then, very seriously and with all her concentration, she held the plate in both hands and walked right over to Jeongguk.\n\u201cYou can have the first pancake,\u201d she said. Jeongguk tucked his phone away with a smile, and then he took the plate with two hands and a bow.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said with gratitude, and Dasom beamed proudly before hopping back up onto the stepping stool.\n\u201cOkay, next one!\u201d\nDasom poured more batter and began to arrange blueberries onto the pancake as Jeongguk set his plate down on the table. Then he came up beside Jimin, slipping an arm around Jimin\u2019s waist. Sensing that Dasom was about to turn around and complain, Jeongguk put one hand on the back of her head to keep her focused on the pan, and then he leaned in and kissed Jimin.\n\u201cI can still hear you!\u201d Dasom hollered, but that didn\u2019t stop Jeongguk from smiling into the next kiss he gave Jimin.\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d he mouthed, and Jimin saw time freeze for a moment.\nHis Sunday mornings usually consisted of scrolling through social media while lying in bed until he was uncomfortable, and then dragging his tired body into the kitchen to make coffee. After washing up, he would then flop onto the couch and drink his coffee while watching something on TV, and then he\u2019d consider maybe going for a run or phoning Namjoon and Taehyung. It was typically silent.\nBut this was a complete departure from the norm. Jimin had been living alone for just over a decade since graduating from university, never once looking back or bothering to think about what life would be like with a partner under the same roof, let alone a kid. None of that had ever really appealed to him. Yet there was something comfortingly domestic and safe about watching Dasom make a smiley face out of the blueberries for her own pancake, something safe about Jeongguk\u2019s arm wrapped around his waist for soft kisses first thing in the morning. It wasn\u2019t a life he had foreseen, but suddenly, it was a life that felt fulfilling in a way he had never anticipated. It was as if Jeongguk and Dasom were filling a void in Jimin\u2019s heart that he hadn\u2019t even known was there in the first place, but now that it was filled, he couldn\u2019t imagine being without it.\n\u201cDasom\u2019s going to her music camp next week,\u201d Jeongguk said to Jimin as they ate their pancakes and fruit. \u201cDuring the day. So if you have time, we can meet up and do something. Take a day trip, go hiking. Do whatever.\u201d\n\u201cWe could go to Samcheok,\u201d Jimin suggested. \u201cIn Gangwon.\u201d\n\u201cWait.\u201d Dasom set her fork down, brow furrowed. \u201cWhat do you mean? You\u2019re meeting up with each other? You\u2019re not staying here?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jeongguk asked, but Dasom was staring at Jimin.\n\u201cI thought you were staying here,\u201d she said in a small voice. \u201cWith us. Don\u2019t you live here now? I thought that was why you were here.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Jimin set his fork down as well, because Dasom sounded confused, but there was also a hint of sadness creeping into her voice that Jimin needed to squash very quickly, because Jeongguk looked stunned. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t live here right now, Dasom-ah. This was just the first time I slept over. I was just trying it out. So that everyone could see what it felt like.\u201d\n\u201cSo when breakfast is over, are you leaving?\u201d Dasom asked, sounding disappointed.\n\u201cI am. I have to go home and take care of a few things.\u201d\n\u201cBut why?\u201d Dasom wondered. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to stay? Don\u2019t\u2014Don\u2019t you love Dad? Don\u2019t you love me, too?\u201d\n\u201cHey. Look at me.\u201d Jimin turned Dasom\u2019s chair to face him, because he could see that Jeongguk was ready to intervene, but Jimin wanted to handle this himself. \u201cI love you both very much. More than you even know. But living together, moving in and being together\u2026 that takes time. Everyone has to be ready for it. I would have to move out of my apartment and find a place for all of my stuff. It\u2019s a lot of work. It has nothing to do with how much I love you and want to stay here with you, because I do. It just takes time. You have to be okay with it. Dad has to be okay with it, too.\u201d\n\u201cBut I  am okay with it,\u201d Dasom insisted fiercely. \u201cIf you live here, you can help me with my homework or\u2014or pick me up from my violin lessons or\u2026 or maybe you can cook dinner. And you can watch TV with us. Do you watch anime?\u201d\n\u201cI love anime.\u201d\n\u201cThen you should live with us. Dad, he should live with us. I said he couldn\u2019t live with us unless he loved you and he loved me, but he said he does,\u201d Dasom declared, turning to speak to Jeongguk now. \u201cDon\u2019t let him leave.\u201d\nSeven months. Jeongguk had been in Jimin\u2019s life for only seven months, and to most people, blending a family within seven months was a tremendous risk. Jeongguk\u2019s biggest fear had always been that Jimin would come into Dasom\u2019s life and not remain permanent, thus ripping her heart out and causing grief. Jimin could see it now\u2014the panic in Jeongguk\u2019s eyes. His worst fear realized. As Jimin locked his gaze on Jeongguk, he could practically hear the silent conversation between them happening\u2014was this the right thing to do? Were they moving too quickly? Was it too much of a risk? How much would it affect Dasom? Would she be traumatized by it no matter how it ended up?\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to you,\u201d Jeongguk whispered, nearly mouthing it. Jimin\u2019s heart stopped, because Jeongguk looked on the verge of tears but in an overwhelmed sort of way, as if breathless with anticipation. Like he had never considered asking Jimin to really move in with them so soon until Dasom had brought it up. And Jeongguk was absolutely right\u2014what if something went wrong? What if their relationship wasn\u2019t as strong as Jimin assumed it was? What if they broke things off and Jimin had to slowly ease out of Dasom\u2019s life?\n\n You\u2019re an idiot. An absolute fool. You\u2019re overthinking this. You know this is it. You know. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Jimin softly said, and then he turned to Dasom. \u201cDasom-ah. It will take time. I have to move out of my own apartment and figure everything out. Do you understand that? I can\u2019t just move in.\u201d\n\u201cAdult stuff,\u201d Dasom figured, and Jimin nodded.\n\u201cAdult stuff,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut if you and Dad want me to be here with you, then\u2026 then I\u2019ll be here. I\u2019ll come live with you.\u201d\n\u201cDad!\u201d Dasom exclaimed immediately, sliding out of her chair and grabbing Jeongguk\u2019s arm. \u201cDad, can he? Dad? Can he come live here? Dad? Dad, are you crying? Why are you crying? Dad, don\u2019t be sad.\u201d\nJimin got out of his chair, and Dasom climbed right into Jeongguk\u2019s lap and sat there, lifting her hands and wiping away the tears as Jeongguk laughed. Jimin wrapped one arm around Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder and the other around Dasom and hugged them both close to him, and Jeongguk sniffed with another small laugh.\n\u201cIs this a family hug?\u201d Dasom asked, and Jeongguk laughed yet again, a few tears soaking into Jimin\u2019s shirt as Jimin held him close. He felt Jeongguk nod.\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a family hug.\u201d\n\u201cDad, can he really live with us?\u201d\n\u201cOf course he can,\u201d Jeongguk whispered, kissing Dasom\u2019s forehead as Jimin kissed the side of Jeongguk\u2019s head.\n\u201cCan I have a tiger tattoo to celebrate?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a little monster, you know that?\u201d Jeongguk said, and Dasom giggled, throwing a happy wrench into the conversation as she grabbed one of Jeongguk\u2019s arms, searched, and found his tiger tattoo.\n\u201cI want mine in the same spot,\u201d she declared. \u201cJiminie  samchon. Do you want a tiger tattoo, too? There are five of them. We can match. I\u2019ll tattoo you. I\u2019m good at it. I even have black gloves.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it sounds like you\u2019re a professional, so I trust you,\u201d Jimin said. Dasom ripped herself from Jeongguk\u2019s arms eagerly.\n\u201cOkay, then don\u2019t leave yet! Will you stay? Stay for a little! I\u2019ll give you a tattoo!\u201d she declared, and then she went running into the living room to gather up everything she needed, all of her sad questions long forgotten and replaced with happy answers. As she rummaged. Jimin sat sideways in Jeongguk\u2019s lap and gently wiped the remaining tears.\n\u201cYou good?\u201d he asked with a smile. \u201cMy hot single dad is out here crying over his boyfriend moving in. Who would\u2019ve thought?\u201d\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re my boyfriend now?\u201d Jeongguk asked, his smile radiant.\n\u201cWell, we might as well just go for it, since you\u2019re asking me to move in with you.\u201d\n\u201cIn my defense, Dasom is the one who asked.\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about it.\u201d\n\u201cI was. But are you positive? This is a lot. It\u2019s a huge change. You\u2019re inheriting an eight-year-old wild child,\u201d Jeongguk warned, and Jimin quieted his anxiety with a kiss, fingertips brushing the hair at the nape of his neck.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry. I have a few ideas, if you\u2019re open to hearing them.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d Jeongguk gently massaged Jimin\u2019s thigh, accepting another kiss. \u201cI love you. You\u2019ve made me so happy. Dasom, too. You\u2019re a dream.\u201d\n\u201cAnd to think this all started out because I made a few bad riding jokes and we couldn\u2019t keep it in our pants,\u201d Jimin sighed, and Jeongguk snickered, dropping his forehead against Jimin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI love you, too. And Dasom. I love you both. We\u2019ll make this work. I promise you.\u201d\n\u201cOKAY, I HAVE TWO TIGERS!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, get used to that. She interrupts everything,\u201d Jeongguk said as Jimin laughed, and Dasom skidded to a halt in the kitchen, staring at Jeongguk and Jimin.\n\u201cWhy do I have to see this?\u201d she complained. \u201cIs no one considering my fragile feelings as an eight-year-old? You\u2019re exposing me to things.\u201d\n\u201cWhere do you  learn this stuff?\u201d Jeongguk asked as Jimin burst out laughing. \u201cShould we not expose you to love? Terribly sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d Dasom said with a grin.\n\u201cYeah, you better be, because now I\u2019m going to kiss him, and you\u2019re going to have to be okay with that,\u201d Jeongguk declared. Dasom smacked the sheets of tattoos over her face, and the moment she did, Jeongguk used a few fingers on Jimin\u2019s jaw to turn his head for a kiss. Jimin sank into it blissfully, clinging to the hope that this was what his life would be like every Sunday morning from here on out.\n\u201cI can still  hear you kissing.\u201d\n\u201cQuiet down in front,\u201d Jeongguk said, and Dasom giggled. Then she reached out and gently took Jimin\u2019s hand, glancing at Jeongguk like she was asking permission to take him away. Jeongguk nodded, so Dasom tugged, and Jimin stood up.\n\u201cDo you want your tiger in the same spot at Dad\u2019s? You do? Perfect. Can you do mine, too? I don\u2019t know if I can do it by myself. You\u2019re really good at arts and crafts, though. I remember from when you were my teacher. We should\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\n\n 1 year later \n\n\u00a0\n\n  mood: \u201cthis is how u feel\u201d by loote  \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe\u2019ll think this is the coolest thing we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\u201cCooler than our Tokyo trip?\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, with her? Yeah.\u201d\nJimin laughed as Jeongguk grinned at him, using his tongue to play with the lip ring piercing he had gotten a few months ago. Dasom was fiercely convinced that her dad was, without question, the coolest dad ever just because of that. Jimin was fiercely convinced that Jeongguk having a lip ring was great for their sex life, and he wasn\u2019t wrong. It benefited everyone.\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be all wired up,\u201d Jeongguk sighed, leaning one elbow against the windowsill and rubbing his forehead, his other wrist draped over the steering wheel. \u201cLast day of school before summer vacation always has her running around like she downed an entire bag of sugar.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, well, she\u2019ll pass out on the drive to Samcheok, anyways,\u201d Jimin pointed out, jabbing his thumb over his shoulder. The trunk of the car was packed, because unbeknownst to Dasom, they were about to drive three hours east to the coast for the start of summer vacation on the beach, something Dasom had been dying to do ever since seeing pictures of Jeongguk and Jimin\u2019s adventure last year.\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope. Oh, here they come.\u201d Jeongguk glanced out the window, so Jimin made the decision to get out of the car and wait. He didn\u2019t work for Jangseong Elementary anymore, nor did he work at Kyodong Elementary. In fact, he had left behind first grade altogether to apply his skill set elsewhere. Jeongguk (and Dasom) had encouraged him to take the leap, and now Jimin was one of the most revered and sought-after educators at a hagwon in Seoul, focusing on mathematics\u2014his specialty. Kids of all ages flocked to him, and he was now able to set his own hours of work and do what he felt was right. Some days, he met with groups of ten-year-olds. Some days, he met with seventeen-year-olds buzzing with anxiety over their upcoming tests. But in all circumstances, Jimin was finally thriving.\n\u201cJiminie  samchon!\u201d \nDasom came sprinting towards Jimin the moment she saw him, stars in her eyes, because Jimin  never picked her up from school. Jeongguk always grabbed her quickly and ran her off to a violin lesson or ice-skating, since Jimin was usually working.\n\u201cHey, how was your last day before summer vacation?\u201d Jimin asked as Dasom quickly hugged him and then stepped back. She was starting to lose the clingy type of affection that Jimin had been used to a year ago, but she was still just as loving.\n\u201cKim  seonsaengnim let us watch some funny videos,\u201d she said in delight as Jimin eyed her with affection. She was wearing her school uniform for spring and summer\u2014navy blue pleated skirt, white short-sleeved button-up, navy blue tie. This morning, Jimin had pulled her long hair up halfway, and the section of hair that was pulled back was in a messy fishtail braid. He was learning quickly how to do Dasom\u2019s hair, mostly because Jeongguk had taught him a few things.\n\u201cOh, did he?\u201d\n\u201cBest teacher ever.\u201d\n\u201cOuch,\u201d Jimin said, smacking his hand to his chest and pouting. Dasom clicked her tongue.\n\u201cNot like  that.  You were the best  first grade  teacher. Kim  seonsaengnim  is the best  third grade teacher. He\u2019s good at science.\u201d\n\u201cSo are you.\u201d Right on cue, Seokjin strolled out and set one large hand on the top of Dasom\u2019s head, and Dasom squatted and ran to Jimin\u2019s side, grinning. She was getting taller now, and Jimin often joked that she would be taller than him someday, which she found absolutely hilarious.\n\u201cMath is my best subject,\u201d Dasom boasted proudly, gluing herself to Jimin\u2019s side.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s because you have a built-in teacher at home who makes math make sense to you,\u201d Seokjin said, amused. Then he tilted his head upward with a grin. \u201cLong time no see!\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Jeongguk said, because he, too, had gotten out of the car. He was standing with both of his tattooed arms resting on the hood of the car right above the open door, grinning. \u201cHas she been good?\u201d\n\u201cAs good as a wild child can be,\u201d Seokjin sighed, and Dasom let out an indignant noise as Jimin suppressed a laugh. \u201cJust kidding. She\u2019s a model student. She may as well be my assistant teacher.\u201d\n\u201cDoes that mean that I can get bubble tea before we go home?\u201d Dasom asked hopefully, grinning. \u201cHome\u201d was not the same anymore, either\u2014at the end of last year\u2019s summer vacation, Jeongguk and Jimin had found a newer and nicer apartment to call their own that was closer to the Han River, and closer to Yoongi and Hoseok as well as Namjoon and Taehyung (Dasom\u2019s newest favorite uncles), and they had moved in as a family.\n\u201cStop bargaining!\u201d Jeongguk called out.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking you!\u201d Dasom fired back, and Jeongguk immediately walked around the car as Dasom laughed and began to run in the opposite direction until Jeongguk faked her out and caught her around the waist. He picked her up with one arm as she wiggled futilely, still giggling.\n\u201cMaybe, if you act cute, we\u2019ll get bubble tea before we hit the road,\u201d Jeongguk said.\n\u201cHit the road?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah. We were thinking of driving to Gangwon,\u201d Jimin casually said. Dasom immediately jumped out into a starfish position as if to say \u201cnobody move,\u201d her eyes wide. Then she looked up at Jimin.\n\u201cSay that again.\u201d\n\u201cGangwon,\u201d he repeated.\n\u201cHow cute do I need to act?\u201d she wondered.\n\u201cExtremely,\u201d Jeongguk said, and then he held his thumb and pointer finger out underneath Dasom\u2019s chin. She immediately puffed her cheeks cutely, and Seokjin let out a laugh.\n\u201cTen out of ten,\u201d he declared, so Dasom turned and gave Seokjin a high-five.\n\u201cOkay, fine. Bubble tea and then off to Gangwon,\u201d Jeongguk said, throwing open the door of the backseat. Dasom threw both of her arms up in victory, and then she turned and bowed hastily.\n\u201cEnjoy your summer vacation, Kim  seonsaengnim,\u201d she politely said.\n\u201cEnjoy the beach,\u201d Seokjin replied, and then he stepped forward and quickly hugged Jimin. \u201cSee you soon.\u201d\n\u201cEnjoy your break,\u201d Jimin said, watching Seokjin shake Jeongguk\u2019s hand.\n\u201cYou two enjoy your break, too. Make sure you get some alone time,\u201d he said with a wink, and then he walked off to go tend to some of the other kids milling around. Jeongguk told Dasom to buckle her seatbelt, and then he closed the car door and smiled at Jimin.\n\u201cRemember when you gave me your number right over there?\u201d Jimin pointed out the very spot where Jeongguk had parked over a year ago with Dasom holding a handmade card.\n\u201cHow could I forget?\u201d Jeongguk opened Jimin\u2019s door for him, and Jimin hopped back into the passenger seat. Once Jeongguk was back in the driver\u2019s seat, he buckled in and leaned over to kiss Jimin sweetly.\n\u201cLess kissing, more bubble tea,\u201d Dasom said, clapping her hands from the backseat. At the same time, Jeongguk and Jimin both set an elbow on the center console and twisted their upper bodies to stare at her. Dasom stared back, her hands in her lap politely, and then she popped her lips once in the silence. Jeongguk and Jimin both burst out laughing, Jimin laughing because it was something that Jeongguk did all the goddamn time.\n\u201cOnward!\u201d Dasom yelled, pumping her fist forward. Jeongguk pulled away from the school and found the first drive-thru where they could get some bubble tea, and once all three of them had a drink, he headed straight for the freeway. With one hand on the steering wheel, he reached his other hand over, and Jimin immediately took it, lacing their fingers together in his lap.\u00a0\nMaybe this wasn\u2019t the life he had imagined for himself years ago. Maybe he had never given much thought to having a makeshift family. Maybe he had failed to anticipate falling head over heels for a former student\u2019s father. The universe had a sense of humor, though, and Jimin was finally in on the joke. He hadn\u2019t just gained a man he could love easily for the rest of his life\u2014he had gained a nine-year-old that he could watch grow into a magnificent young woman someday, a girl who wanted to share her experiences with Jimin eagerly just as she shared them with her own father. Jimin glanced in the rearview mirror, catching a glimpse of Dasom chewing on the red straw of her bubble tea, and he smiled.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Dad.\u201d Dasom removed the straw from her mouth. Jimin saw the mischievous grin on her face, but he chose not to warn Jeongguk, ready to laugh at the outcome.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s eyes flicked to the rearview mirror as well, tongue tracing over his lip ring as he did. Jimin admired his partner for a fleeting moment, soaking in the scene and embracing that this was his beautiful life now. This was what he would have for the foreseeable future\u2014violin concerts, ice skating competitions, gym sessions with his partner, trips around the world. Jimin looked back to Dasom, who was still grinning.\n\u201cCan I have a turn driving?\u201d\n\u201cNot on your life, kid.\u201d\n\u201cIt was worth a shot.\u201d"
