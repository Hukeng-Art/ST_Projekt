    "summary": "<p>When the prosecution starts throwing around the word victim in reference to Adrien, he has to stuff his hands under his thighs to keep himself from bolting out of the courtroom. </p>\n<p>Adrien had felt unsafe during those last few weeks, but, until he had woken up and seen Father silhouetted in his bedroom doorway, that had only been paranoia. Father was controlling and cold, but he wasn\u2019t hateful. Adrien was isolated. He was often hungry. And some weeks ago, when he had snuck out to visit Nino, sitting thigh-to-thigh on his bed while Adrien cried in that silent, crumbling way of his, he hadn\u2019t argued when Nino put a hand on his shoulder and said, tentatively, <em>That\u2019s abuse.</em></p>\n<p>But Adrien remembers being small and Father touching his hair after he\u2019d aced another test; Father holding his scribbled drawings like they were something precious, and framing them around his office; Father, dressed as Hawkmoth, his eyes wild behind the mask, lashing his sword against Adrien\u2019s baton; Father, collapsed against Mum, crying into her ashy hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Adrien finds out Gabriel is Hawkmoth, and Gabriel gets to bring his long-waited plan into action.</p>",

    "text": "When Ms. Bustier assigns them a project about family-trees, Adrien already knows he\u2019s going to struggle to pass. The only relative he has semi-regular contact with is his father, who is too preoccupied to help him with something trivial like a school assignment.\nHe doesn\u2019t want to take this to Nathalie. Not yet. She would come back with a clinical .jpeg of his family tree attached to an even more clinical email. Adrien doesn\u2019t want his family history written out like a textbook. He wants the authentic photos and scribbled family antidotes his classmates have already started to bring into class.\nHe has some of his mother\u2019s photos, but he wants something else. Maybe his history is hidden in the attic. In movies, family secrets are always hidden in the attic.\nAdrien has never been to the small upstairs area. Father instructed him to stick to his areas of the mansion, so that he wouldn\u2019t interfere with his work, but Father isn\u2019t here right now.\nAdrien glances around, but there aren\u2019t any staff in sight. He dashes past the main staircase, towards the back of the mansion. There\u2019s another staircase there, heading up to the smaller third floor.\nMost of it is storage. Adrien rummages through a stack of boxes, but only finds clothes from old Gabriel lines, and a lot of dust. Plagg twists in the air, coughing loudly.\n\u201cWhat are you doing, kid? Can\u2019t we go back to your nice clean room?\u201d\n\u201cThis is important,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about my family, not like the other kids do. I\u2019ll never have a big extended family, but I can at least learn as much as I can.\u201d\nPlagg takes a moment to look at Adrien, his squared shoulders, the almost desperate determination in his eyes, before sighing and lifting higher into the air. \u201cFine, but you\u2019re not going to find anything in this dusty closet.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that\u2014\u201d Plagg zips out of the closet. Adrien sighs, and calls after him, \u201cStay out of sight!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me how to do my job!\u201d\nAdrien abandons the boxes to scan the upper shelves, but he only finds old magazines. The few folders he does find contain paperwork. Nothing personal.\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s this?\u201d\nAdrien sticks his head out of the closet. He finds Plagg hovering behind a hidden door, hand pressed against it.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Adrien asks.\nPlagg frowns. \u201cWhat\u2019s behind this door?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know there was a door here.\u201d\nThey manage to pry open the door. Inside is a cavernous room. A round window is on one side of the room, covered by metal plating. There\u2019s no furniture, but there are hundreds of white butterflies, ethereal in the dimly lit room.\nAdrien doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s looking at. A hidden room, the windows covered up with protective barrier, the butterflies, and Plagg\u2019s sudden shock\u2014the puzzle pieces slot together.\n\u201cThose butterflies,\u201d Adrien says slowly, like he\u2019s testing out the words, \u201cthey look like \u2026 \u201d\n\u201cHawkmoth\u2019s,\u201d Plagg says, shivering in midair.\n\u201cBut this is my house.\u201d Adrien rubs a hand over his arms. He\u2019s cold, suddenly. \u201cThis is my house, Plagg. Why would the butterflies Hawkmoth uses to akumatise people be here\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your dad?\u201d\nAdrien pauses. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know when he\u2019ll be back?\u201d Adrien shakes his head, no. \u201cWe need to get out of here. If he knows that we know\u2014\u201d\nAdrien stumbles back. The butterflies flutter around them, never touching but not afraid of their presence. Their wings are opalescent.\n\u201cPlagg, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not this dumb, kid.\u201d\nAdrien walks backward until his back hits the wall. \u201cThere has to be another explanation for this. Just because there\u2019s a room with butterflies doesn\u2019t mean\u2014we don\u2019t know where Hawkmoth even is or what he really looks like. Maybe\u2014maybe\u2014\u201d\nPlagg presses up against Adrien\u2019s cheek. His small body is velvet-soft.\n\u201cKid,\u201d Plagg says gently, more gentle than he ever is with Adrien, \u201cwe have to go.\u201d\nAdrien\u2019s knees are shaking. \u201cPlagg.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be with you the whole way. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\nAdrien\u2019s hand flies to his ring, warm with the thrum of dormant magic. Touching it gives him strength.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Adrien says, \u201clet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey run down the stairs, and back into his room. (If he uses the front door, he might run into the staff, and then if they ask Adrien where he's going, he knows that he\u2019ll open his mouth to answer and his heart will slide out through his teeth.)\nAdrien transforms halfway to the window. He jumps up, out of his room, and doesn\u2019t stop running until the rooftops all look the same, and he can\u2019t hear himself thinking above the blood pulsing in his ears.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen patrol comes, the words get caught in Adrien\u2019s throat.\nLadybug cocks her head to one side. \u201cChat? What is it?\u201d\nAll this time, they\u2019ve been fighting Hawkmoth. What will happen now? Would Ladybug want to charge into the Agreste mansion and confront him? Fight him?\nHe doesn\u2019t know if he could fight Father.\n\u201cThe akumas,\u201d he says slowly, thinking about each word before he speaks it, something he does when he\u2019s Adrien Agreste, not when he\u2019s Chat Noir. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll ever stop?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make them stop.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe Hawkmoth will stop on his own.\u201d\nLadybug shoots him a disbelieving look. \u201cHawkmoth isn\u2019t going to give up. We\u2019ll defeat him, and then they\u2019ll stop.\u201d\nShe\u2019s right. He knows she\u2019s right. His heart jackrabbits in his chest; he\u2019s still\u00a0in shock even now, hours later.\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re alright, kitty?\u201d Ladybug says.\nHe shakes his head, and musters up a smile. She blinks at him, alarmed, and he realises that this polite, distant-eyed smile is an Adrien Agreste smile, not a Chat Noir smile. He widens his smile, shows more teeth. She relaxes.\n\u201cOff night?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cMe? Never.\u201d He steps onto the balcony ledge, unhooking his baton from the small of his back. \u201cReady to go?\u201d\n\u201cYou can tell me anything,\u201d Ladybug says. \u201cYou know that, right?\u201d\nHis smile dim, becomes more Adrien, less showboating Chat Noir. He taps his mask. \u201cNot quite anything, right?\u201d\n\u201cI meant that I\u2019m here for you if anything\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know. I think the identity thing might be a good thing, after all. Imagine if I knew your identity, and he found out \u2026 \u201d\nLadybug steps onto the ledge beside him. Her hand ghosts over his shoulder, and Adrien startles.\n\u201cChat,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s get going,\u201d he says. He extends his baton and leaps over the street, not checking if Ladybug is following.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt starts with his meals shrinking.\nAdrien spoons through his porridge, making a face. It\u2019s not even poached eggs on wholemeal toast this morning. Just plain porridge. There\u2019s not even a bowl of fruit on the side.\n\u201cNathalie,\u201d he starts.\n\u201cYour father has a new line in mind for summer,\u201d she says without looking up from her tablet.\n\u201cI\u2019m at the right weight.\u201d\n\u201cNot for this photo shoot.\u201d\nAdrien frowns at the porridge. He hates porridge. It tastes like melted paper. \u201cHow is the \u2018starved teenager\u2019 aesthetic supposed to sell clothes?\u201d\nNathalie sighs and finally looks up from her tablet. She looks tired, but that\u2019s how she usually looks when she talks to him\u2014exhausted by how difficult he is to handle. \u201cAnd you are more of an expert on the fashion world than your father, the internationally renowned designer with decades of experience?\u201d\n\u201cFather was the one that changed my diet?\u201d Adrien asks.\n\u201cYes. Eat your breakfast.\u201d\nAdrien is hungry all through his morning classes. At lunch, he opens up a Tupperware container full of salad, and Nino frowns at him.\n\u201cThat looks very \u2026 green,\u201d Nino says.\nAdrien stabs a cherry tomato with his fork. They agreed to bring lunch today, and he can\u2019t help but wonder if he would have been given something different if he was at home. Maybe soup. Maybe the soup would come with a toasted sandwich. Adrien would do anything for a toasted sandwich right now.\n\u201cNew diet,\u201d Adrien says into a forkful of spinach.\nNino blinks at him. \u201cNew diet? Dude, your old one sucked balls, and now you\u2019re on something worse?\u201d\n\u201cApparently.\u201d\n\u201cNo. No way. That\u2019s not healthy.\u201d\nAdrien shrugs. His old diet wasn\u2019t so bad\u2014standard portion control and healthy meals to make sure he didn\u2019t start eating fatty foods.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I can argue,\u201d Adrien says.\nNino pulls out his second sandwich and hands it to Adrien. He tries to refuse, but Nino shoves it at him again, more forcefully, and says, \u201cI\u2019d rather you eat it then have to sit here and watch you eat plain spinach with, like, three tomatoes. It\u2019s painful, dude. Painful.\u201d\nWhen Nino cracks open a packet of chips, he tilts the bag at Adrien without saying anything. Adrien ends up eating more than half of the chips, too. He doesn\u2019t even realise until his fingers are brushing the bottom of the bag. He jerks his hand out.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Adrien says, face growing warm.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d Nino says, and for some reason, he sounds smug.\nNino\u2019s lunches almost double in size, after that. Adrien stops pretending to be annoyed that his friend is feeding him peanut butter sandwiches, and cold leftovers, and chips. Nino doesn\u2019t complain about not going out to get lunch anymore.\n\u201cWhat does you family say when they see you packing such big lunches in the morning?\u201d Adrien says, halfway through a container of cold pasta.\n\u201cThey say, \u2018that Gabriel Agreste is a dickmuncher.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThey do not!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, maybe not exactly those words, but you get the idea. My parents are not a fan of your old man. At all.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for Alya and Marinette to join in, too. It\u2019s not a secret that Adrien is overworked and that his father is overly strict, since everyone knows Nino was akumatised because Adrien wasn\u2019t allowed to have a birthday party. That doesn\u2019t stop Adrien from being embarrassed when the two girls frown at his lunches.\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s not that bad?\u201d he tries.\n\u201cNo, it is that bad,\u201d Alya says. \u201cI\u2019m with Nino on this one\u2014your dad\u2019s a scumbag.\u201d\nMarinette dumps her backpack onto the bench. Several boxes full of pastries fall out. Adrien looks at her like she hung the sun. Marinette goes red.\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not that much! Nino texted me, and well, I\u2019m a bakery\u2014 I mean, my parents run a bakery. We always have leftovers. Not that I don\u2019t care, I care about you\u2014I just\u2014\u201d Alya shoves a croissant into her mouth. She chews and tells Alya, muffled, \u201cThank you.\u201d\nHis friends aren\u2019t there at home, though. Nino tries to offer him food to take home, but Adrien is scared that the housekeeper will accidentally find some of it, and then Father will put a stop\u00a0to the food he receives at school, probably by forcing him to come home for lunches, and checking his schoolbag.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere are more akuma attacks.\nBefore, there were several akuma in one week, and then, suddenly, there\u2019s a new akuma every day.\nAdrien can\u2019t predict it. Sometimes, the akuma appears during his lunch period, before he\u2019s managed to scarf down the food his friends have offered him. Sometimes, an akuma appears in the middle of the night, his phone waking him up with a series of beeping notifications. And a few times, the akuma has woken him up in the pre-dawn mornings, only a few hours after Adrien had pulled himself from homework and climbed into bed.\nNo matter what time they appear, it feels like the daily akuma attacks are always at the worst times.\nAdrien might have been secretly pleased to see Ladybug, but he keeps picturing that empty room sat at the top of the Agreste mansion, swarming with butterflies. The secret is lodged in his throat. He can\u2019t let it out, not yet, but it\u00a0hurts to keep it from Ladybug.\n\u201cHe\u2019s growing more powerful,\u201d Ladybug says while they\u2019re hiding in an empty store, waiting for the akumatised nightshift employee to reappear.\n\u201cBut the akumas themselves aren\u2019t becoming more difficult to deal with.\u201d\nLadybug hums, leaning back against the freezer. \u201cYou would think that he\u2019d focus on making one overcharged akuma that could take us down, not lots of small ones that aren\u2019t especially challenging.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he just likes inconveniencing us.\u201d\n\u201cHe needs a new hobby.\u201d\n\u201cWe should send him some knitting brochures.\u201d\nLadybug\u2019s laugh comes out as a snort. The sound unknots some of the tension settled behind Adrien\u2019s ribs.\n\u201cMail him some thousand piece puzzles,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just need to find out his email, and then we can sign him up for yoga classes. I heard they\u2019re calming.\u201d\nAdrien knows Hawkmoth\u2019s address. He tries to picture Father in yoga pants, trying to do the downward dog between rows of mums in pastel-coloured active wear, but the image won\u2019t come.\n\u201cAll these akumas,\u201d Adrien says, \u201cwhat do they mean?\u201d\nLadybug sobers. \u201cI think it means he\u2019s getting serious. I think \u2026 \u201d Her grip on her yo-yo tightens. \u201cI think it means he\u2019s planning something. Something big.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdrien\u2019s schedule becomes more cramped.\nHe didn\u2019t think it was possible, but somehow, Father manages to squeeze more events into his schedule. Fashion shows, collaborative photo-shoots that block out entire afternoons and eat into his evening, extra piano and Chinese lessons to make up for the ones he\u2019s missed, more tutoring with Nathalie in preparation for end of term exams, despite the fact that Adrien is firmly at the top of his class after years of homeschooling, his grades only rivalled by Max.\nThe few moments he once managed to get with his friends outside of school vanish. Some days, he doesn\u2019t even have time to see his friends during the lunch break before he\u2019s being whisked off to a quick photo-shoot.\nAdrien\u2019s days grow longer. He can barely make it to patrol, most days, and when he does, he\u2019s listing to one side, struggling to keep his eyes open.\nLadybug is worried. It feels like everyone is worried.\nAdrien is too exhausted to be worried himself.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdrien doesn\u2019t remember falling asleep. He remembers, vaguely, stumbling out of bed and getting dressed half-blind, ignoring Plagg zipping around his ears and nagging about getting enough sleep. He remembers the watery oats he had for breakfast. He remembers struggling to keep his eyes open on the short drive to school.\nHe doesn\u2019t remember laying his head on his desk and passing out, but the next thing he knows, Chloe is slamming her hands down, and complaining, \u201cAdrien, we haven\u2019t hung out in weeks. Weeks. You\u2019re neglecting me.\u201d\nAdrien sits upright, blinking at the bright lights. \u201cHuh?\u201d\nChloe gasps. \u201cHoney, what happened to your face?\u201d\nAdrien presses a hand to his face. It\u2019s still there. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThe bags under your eyes\u2014I knew you were tired, but you look terrible. Are your lips peeling?\u201d\nAdrien runs a hand over his lips. The skin there flakes beneath his touch. Chloe makes a piteous noise in the back of her throat, and snaps at Sabrina to pass her handbag over. Even Sabrina winces when she looks at him.\n\u201cI look that bad?\u201d Adrien asks.\n\u201cYou still look better than everyone else in this class, except for me,\u201d Chloe says, not bothering to lower her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s because you look so perfect all the time that it stands out so much when you\u2019re under the weather. You poor baby.\u201d\nAdrien doesn\u2019t like Chloe\u2019s baby talk most days, but now, as tired as he is, it feels almost \u2026 nice. It\u2019s familiar and easy. She rifles through her handbag until she finds her fluffy makeup bag.\n\u201cGood thing I still have that liquid concealer in your shade. I\u2019m that considerate.\u201d\n\u201cNo dark eyeshadow this time,\u201d he says quietly.\nShe huffs out a breath. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun.\u201d\nWhen he blinks his eyes open sometime later, Chloe is pulling out an eyeliner pen and a stick of highlighter. \u201cChloe!\u201d\n\u201cOh, come on! You\u2019d look cute with cat-eye. It\u2019s just a tiny flick.\u201d\nA part of him wants to let her put the eyeliner on him, just for the potential pun material that is cat-eye, but a larger part of him doesn\u2019t want to stand out. Not today, when he feels stretched out like melted taffy. And Father dislikes when he wears dark makeup outside of photo-shoots. He wants to avoid being scolded (as much as he can avoid it, anyway).\n\u201cChloe.\u201d\nShe rolls her eyes, but sweeps her makeup back into her bag. She pulls out a tube of lip balm, and presses it into his hand. \u201cAt least wear this. It\u2019s only tinted a little bit. Very cute. Trust me.\u201d\nHe folds his fingers around the tube. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nShe hesitates, hovering over his desk. The way she\u2019s looking at him\u2014he doesn\u2019t know the last time she looked at any of her friends with that searching stare. Maybe when he said he couldn\u2019t be friends with someone who was mean. Maybe when Mum left and she swept into the mansion three days later, marching past the spluttering staff and into his room.\nMarinette almost runs into Chloe, because she\u2019s too busy staring at Adrien. \u201cPink,\u201d she says.\nChloe pushes her away. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, Dupain-Cheng.\u201d\nMarinette ignores her. \u201cYou look nice\u2014I mean, your makeup looks nice, Adrien.\u201d\n\u201cOf course it does,\u201d Chloe says, sniffing. \u201cI did it.\u201d\nAlya pokes out from behind Marinette. \u201cAdrien, digging the eyeshadow!\u201d\nAdrien goes to touch his face, but Chloe bats his hand away.\n\u201cYou look great,\u201d Marinette blurts, seeing the tight expression on his face. She reddens. \u201cThe eyeshadow is this soft peach colour? Um. Very\u2014very nice.\u201d\nA muted colour. That\u2019s fine, then.\n\u201cAlthough his hair is a lost cause,\u201d Chloe says, not even bothering to run her fingers through his fringe to settle it. \u201cAnd his clothes. Adrien, honey, you are better than this.\u201d\nAdrien doesn\u2019t remember choosing his clothes this morning. He looks down at his chest. He\u2019s surprised Nathalie let him out of the house in a plain hoodie. \u201cHuh.\u201d\nChloe chews at her lip. Marinette looks around Chloe\u2019s shoulder. Chloe is too preoccupied by staring at Adrien, her eyebrows pinched together, an almost painfully thoughtful expression on her face, to shove Marinette away.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Marinette asks.\nAdrien pulls on a smile. \u201cOf course.\u201d\nNone of them look like they believe him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdrien is burnt out. When he wakes one morning and is near-delirious with fever, he isn\u2019t surprised.\nHe climbs out of bed, and tumbles into the first pair of jeans he sees. He doesn\u2019t see the dirt scuffed up one leg from where he\u2019d dashed into an alleyway to transform. He snags a t-shirt, and doesn\u2019t realise it\u2019s a pyjama shirt.\nNathalie takes one look at him and grimaces. \u201cYou cannot leave the house like that.\u201d\nAdrien stands on the stairs, blinking at her. He looks down at himself. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cGo get changed into something appropriate. I\u2019ll fetch the painkillers\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d Father steps around Nathalie, and looks Adrien over. He hadn\u2019t even noticed Father was home. \u201cAdrien is unwell. He won\u2019t be going to school today.\u201d\nTo Nathalie\u2019s credit, she only hesitates a moment before she nods. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cGo back to your room,\u201d Father tells him, and then returns to his office, Nathalie on his heels.\nAdrien wobbles back to his room, rubbing at his temples. It was a simple matter to reschedule tutors when he was a child, but for other things, like photo-shoots and fashion events, he was always expected to push through. After starting public school, Father had made it clear he would pull him out permanently if Adrien failed to meet those same expectations. And he already missed enough school as it was, with the akuma attacks.\nStrange.\n\u201cThis is what you get,\u201d Plagg says when they\u2019re alone in his room. \u201cNot sleeping, eating weirdly\u2014you humans are too fragile to mess around with your bodies like that.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t help my weird sleeping schedule,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for the akumas to start attacking in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\u201cAnd all those times you stayed up reading fanfiction?\u201d\n\u201c \u2026 Shut up.\u201d Adrien rubs a hand through his sweaty hair. \u201cI can\u2019t help my diet either.\u201d\nPlagg scrunches up his face. They\u2019ve had this argument enough times over the past few weeks.\n\u201cAt least change into something clean,\u201d Plagg says. He ducks into Adrien\u2019s drawers, and emerges with clean pyjamas.\n\u201cLike your cheese is any better,\u201d Adrien mutters under his breath. He changes, and crawls under the covers. He falls asleep before he can register Plagg, sitting on the neighbouring pillow, watching over Adrien with uncharacteristic quietness.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdrien wakes when something bites his arm.\nHe jerks upright, dazed and bleary-eyed. It takes a moment for his dark room to come into focus, and when it does, Adrien rubs at his eyes, cotton-wool brain not making sense of the figure silhouetted in his doorway.\n\u201cFather?\u201d\nFather doesn\u2019t say anything. Beneath the covers, on the side furtherest away from the door, Plagg presses against Adrien\u2019s stomach. His small hands knead the skin there.\n\u201cFather?\u201d Adrien says again. He fumbles for his phone, and winces at the brightness. It\u2019s before lunchtime, but he already has a stack of unread messages. Chloe is throwing a small fit at his absence. Nino is asking if he\u2019s been kidnapped, or if he\u2019s been whisked away to another impromptu photo-shoot.\nFather presses a hand to the sweat-damp hair curling around his temples. He doesn\u2019t push his fringe out of his face, like he did when Adrien was younger; instead, he tips Adrien\u2019s head back, lightly grasping a fistful of hair.\nFather looks at him, searching. \u201cHow are you, Adrien?\u201d\n\u201cFather,\u201d Adrien says, working his dry tongue against his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m in an oven.\u201d\n\u201cAn oven,\u201d Father repeats.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hot. It\u2019s \u2026 an oven.\u201d\nPlagg presses against him insistently. Adrien flops a hand over his belly, trying to push both Plagg and the blankets off. His pyjamas sticks to his skin. He wants to go and lay belly-down on a tin roof, the way he does on hot nights when he\u2019s Chat Noir, when it\u2019s been dark for hours and all the heat has seeped out of the cold metal.\n\u201cLet me help you,\u201d Father says\nFather takes Adrien\u2019s wrist, and turns his hand over. His fingers brush against the silver ring, and Adrien snatches his hand back, pushing back against the headboard. His sleepiness and fever-soft thoughts are gone, chased away by a fresh rush of adrenaline.\n\u201cAdrien,\u201d Father says, leaning in, \u201cyou\u2019re sick. I\u2019m trying to help\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Adrien says. He pants, open-mouthed. The air in the room is too thin.\n\u201cCome here.\u201d His voice isn\u2019t gentle, but it is quiet. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help you, Adrien. You\u2019re too young to understand all of this.\u201d\nFather sits down on the bed, and reaches for Adrien. His hand is open, palm up.\n\u201cAdrien,\u201d Father says, voice hardening with each moment Adrien stays out of reach, \u201ccome here.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Adrien says, and he clings to the firmness in his voice. He\u2019s shaking, but his voice is strong. \u201cNo.\u201d\nFather is getting annoyed, now. He stands, so much taller than Adrien, especially when he\u2019s like this, sprawled out in twisted sheets.\n\u201cAdrien.\u201d\nPlagg nips at his side. It doesn\u2019t hurt, but it\u2019s enough to make Adrien jump out the opposite side of the bed, right as Father makes a grab for him.\nFather is breathing heavily now, too. It\u2019s not sickness or fear, but something else\u2014frustration, maybe, or the sheer effort it takes to hold himself back.\nHold himself back from what?\n\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d Adrien asks,\n\u201cLong enough to know this is a fool\u2019s errand. You are running around after that girl, and for what? You aren\u2019t making any real progress.\u201d Father\u2019s face softens, and it isn\u2019t out of fondness, the way Mum\u2019s face would gentle when she bent down to look at him, brushing his fringe out of his eyes. It\u2019s pity. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need you to fight. She\u2019s the one with the lucky charms, and the purifying yo-yo. She\u2019s the one Paris loves.\u201d\n\u201cShe needs my help,\u201d Adrien says.\n\u201cHow many times have you been caught or brainwashed by an akuma? How many fights has she won on her own?\u201d Father holds his hand out again, expectant. \u201cParis doesn\u2019t need two superheroes.\u201d\nAdrien cradles his hand to his chest, ring hidden beneath his other palm. He doesn\u2019t move.\nFather sighs, and shakes his head. Adrien barely feels it; he\u2019s used to disappointing him.\n\u201cWhy must you always be so difficult?\u201d\nThey stay like that for a beat, frozen, and then Father lunges across the bed and makes another grab for him.\nAdrien scuttled backward. He grabs the lamp off his bedside dresser, and holds it in front of him like a fencing sword. His pulse is in his ears.\nFather bares his teeth. He doesn\u2019t look like Hawkmoth like this\u2014hair gelled tightly back, wearing a salmon tie and grey blazer that clash with his flushed face. He just looks like Adrien\u2019s dad.\nPlagg zips out of Adrien\u2019s shirt. \u201cKid, you need to transform.\u201d\nAdrien doesn\u2019t listen to him.\n\u201cHow long have you been planning this?\u201d Adrien asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m not stupid.\u201d\n\u201cThis whole time\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d Father says. \u201cWho is Ladybug?\u201d\n\u201cThis whole time you were waiting. Planning.\u201d Adrien shakes his head. \u201cDo you\u2014do you even love me?\u201d\n\u201cThis is foolish, Adrien,\u201d Father says. \u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous. If you join me\u2014\u201d\nAdrien drops the lamp. \u201cPlagg, claws out.\u201d\nHis sight blurs with green light. Father shouts, and Adrien jumps backward, running out of his bedroom and into the main area, where the window is propped open.\n\u201cWait!\u201d Adrien hesitates on the window sill. Father spreads his hands out. \u201cYou\u2019re my son, Adrien. I love you, of course I do. I love you as much as I can.\u201d\nAdrien pulls out his baton and hurls himself into the air. Father yells behind him. Adrien pushes onward. The suit dampens the effects of his illness. The fever is barely present\u2014why, then, does Adrien feel like he\u2019s in so much pain?\nHe runs blindly, putting as much space between himself and the mansion as he can. He wants Plagg there beside him, telling him what to do, complaining about wasting energy, but he has to be Chat Noir right now. And Chat Noir doesn\u2019t have Plagg there to hold his hand.\nThe rooftops grow closer together as he gets deeper into the city. Everything is slick with rain. The air is fresh and damp, but Adrien barely feels it; he\u2019s still overheated and dizzy. He knows he\u2019s panicking. His heart is racing, and he can\u2019t shake the hind-brain feeling of being prey, of being chased down, even though he keeps looking over his shoulder and finding nothing but empty air.\nHe doesn\u2019t pay attention to where he is. He tries to lunge across the street, and misjudges the distance. His chin crashes into the side of the building, arms scrabbling for purchase, and then he\u2019s rocketing back down to Earth.\nAll the air rushes out of his lung. Sprawled out on the damp pavement, gasping to draw breath, he doesn\u2019t notice the pedestrians crowding around him until someone pokes him in the side.\n\u201cChat Noir? Are you alright?\u201d\nAdrien squints up. A haze of red curls, a determined face\u2014\n\u201cAlya?\u201d\n\u201cHe knows your name,\u201d Nino says. He elbows her in the side with a quick grin, before focussing on Adrien. \u201cHow are you doing, dude? That was a crazy fall.\u201d\n\u201cNino,\u201d Adrien says, dazed. Nino blinks down at him. \u201cWhere \u2026 ?\u201d\n\u201cYou know his name, too?\u201d Alya asks.\n\u201cIs he the real Chat Noir? Maybe he\u2019s one of those enthusiastic cosplayers that run around doing parkour.\u201d\nAlya shakes her head. Her phone is in one hand, not angled at Adrien. He wonders if he looks as bad as he feels, if she\u2019s showing so much mercy.\n\u201cNo one that\u2019s not wearing a magic suit could\u2019ve fallen from that height without breaking their neck.\u201d Alya looks him over again. \u201cYour neck isn\u2019t broken, is it?\u201d\nAdrien pushes himself up onto his elbow. Nino hovers beside him, like he wants to help, but doesn\u2019t know where to put his hands. It\u2019s strange. If he were Adrien Agreste, Nino would have already scooped him up and demanded he visit the nurse.\nAdrien climbs to his feet. Nino is still there, hovering with his arms outstretched, ready to catch him. Alya\u2019s eyes are piercing.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Ladybug?\u201d Alya asks.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not an akuma attack, is there?\u201d Nino asks, checking the news app on his phone.\nAdrien shakes his head. His headache thumps behind his eyes. The rain-drenched sun glints off the puddles, making it worse.\n\u201cWhat are you doing out, then?\u201d Alya asks, arms crossed over her chest.\n\u201cHey, it is lunch break,\u201d Nino says. \u201cMaybe he felt like stretching his legs.\u201d\nAlya steps around Nino, leaning in uncomfortably close. Adrien feels like she\u2019s going to try and identify him again, but when she presses a hand to his face, it\u2019s not to pick at the mask sealed to his face, but to check how flushed he is.\n\u201cDo you have a fever?\u201d Alya asks.\n\u201cUm,\u201d Adrien says.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Nino says. \u201cAre you pulling the mum card on a superhero right now? Alya.\u201d\n\u201cI will be the mum friend for all of Paris if I have to,\u201d Alya says. Nino makes an apologetic face at Adrien. \u201cWhy did you go out if you\u2019re sick? You just fell three storeys onto cement. And you\u2019re quiet. You\u2019re never quiet.\u201d\nAdrien steps back, hands up. He gives them his best smile. \u201cThat\u2019s confidential, I\u2019m sorry, but don\u2019t worry. Everything is under control, citizens.\u201d\n\u201cI know you know our names,\u201d Alya says. \u201cYou just said them.\u201d\n\u201cYou were hearing things.\u201d\nNino chews on the inside of his cheek. That\u2019s a face Adrien is familiar with.\n\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Nino starts. \u201cWe were just heading to a friend\u2019s place. Her family owns a bakery. You should come with us. Sit down, eat something\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Marinette won\u2019t mind,\u201d Alya says, turning around to observe the empty side street. \u201cShe\u2019s right\u2014oh. Where did Marinette go? She was right there \u2026 \u201d\nAdrien collects his baton from where it had rolled away when he had fallen. His heart has calmed some. The sight of his friend\u2019s faces bolsters something inside him.\n\u201cI have to go.\u201d Adrien offers another Chat Noir smile, and waves. His baton extends and he shoots back into the sky, flipping over the ledge that almost took his head off.\n\u201cCome back here, young man,\u201d Alya shouts after him, shaking her fist at him.\n\u201cPlease be safe, dude,\u201d Nino shouts. \u201cDrink some water!\u201d\nAdrien only makes it over a few more rooftops before he slows and then stops. Where will he go now?\n\u201cFancied a midday stroll?\u201d\nAdrien whirls around, and there, her suit an offensive blot of red against the drizzling cityscape, is Ladybug.\n\u201cI heard you face-planted off a building,\u201d she says, \u201cand yet you keep telling me cats land on their feet. You really gave those two kids a scare back there. When they saw me, they were falling over each other to point me in your direction.\u201d\nShe drops off the higher roof, and lands beside the misty greenhouse. He doesn\u2019t realise how much he\u2019s missed her until she\u2019s stepping closer, finally in arms reach, and his legs go weak. He falls into her.\n\u201cChat!\u201d Her arms come up and wrap around him on reflex. He pushes his face into her neck. She sighs. Her hand settles on his hair, still mused from sleeping all morning. \u201cOh, Chat.\u201d\nHe loosens his hold on her, and she makes soft, soothing noises and pulls him closer. She rocks them from side to side. He\u2019s shaking. She has to feel that, the violent tremors, but she just keeps patting his hair, murmuring nonsensically. He doesn\u2019t know how long they stand like that, swaying like long grass in the wind. When he finally pulls away, he feels drained and rested all at once.\nLadybug cups his face. \u201cHey, there.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Adrien says, voice wrecked. He gropes for a joke, some kind of pun to fill the heavy silence. \u201cNice weather we\u2019re having.\u201d\nShe looks up at the bloated rainclouds. \u201cNo, not really.\u201d\nAdrien sits against the edge of the greenhouse. Ladybug follows him down. The glass is wet against their backs.\n\u201cAre you ready to tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you think something is wrong?\u201d\n\u201cChat.\u201d\nAdrien rubs a hand against the back of his neck. Even through the glove, he can feel how warm his skin is. \u201cHave you ever realised that everything you knew about someone\u2014 all the assumptions you\u2019d made, the excuses they\u2019d made, the lives you\u2019d built up around each other\u2014was wrong? That you thought you understood someone, but maybe, you never did.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve wrongly judged people before,\u201d Ladybug says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d\nLadybug rests a hand on his knee. She\u2019s so kind. It feels so good to have her there, silent and strong, a pillar of support. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nWarring desires push up inside of him. There\u2019s the desire to keep the dirty parts of himself hidden, and keep his father and Ladybug as far away from each other as he can. And there\u2019s the fresh panic, the animal fear he\u2019d felt when his father hunted him down in his own bedroom and tried to snatch his ring away.\nLadybug is there when it\u2019s dangerous. She keeps him safe, just as much as he protects her. He wants her to fix this. He wants a lucky charm that will magic this all away. He wants to go back to the days when his father was distant in that cold, excusable way, and Adrien could pretend the disappointment didn't hurt, and Hawkmoth was just a faceless puppeteer on the other end of the akuma attacks.\nLadybug turns his hand over, and laces their fingers together. She squeezes his hand. \u201cYou can tell me anything.\u201d\nAdrien draws in a breath. \u201cEven if \u2026 \u201d\n\u201cEven if,\u201d she says without hesitation. He waits for her to add, unless it comprises our identities.\u00a0But she doesn\u2019t.\nAdrien straightens, tries to anchor himself to the feel of Ladybug\u2019s hand wrapped up in his own, and opens his mouth.\nAn explosion rocks the street.\nLadybug draws away. \u201cThat sounds like an akuma. I\u2019m sorry, Chat, but we have to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLadybug.\u201d Adrien grabs her hand.\nShe carefully pries him away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I promise, after this, we can sit down and talk this out. I\u2019ll block out my entire evening. We have to quickly deal with this akuma, and then\u2014\u201d\nShe unhooks her yo-yo and steps up onto the roof\u2019s edge. Adrien is seized with an irrational terror. If he lets her go, if she disappears out of his line of sight, then he can\u2019t protect her.\nHawkmoth is somewhere out there. Waiting for them to come after him.\nWaiting for Adrien.\nShe pulls her arm back to throw her yo-yo, and Adrien grabs her again. She turns, another apology on her lips, and freezes when she sees his face, twisted up with stress.\n\u201cHe\u2019s my father,\u201d Adrien says.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ladybug says.\n\u201cHawkmoth.\u201d Adrien can\u2019t bear her touch, suddenly. He pulls away. He feels unclean. Dirty. \u201cHawkmoth is my father.\u201d\nLadybug drops her throwing arm. Adrien pulls at his fingers. The gloves aren\u2019t removable; they barely move when he tugs at them with all his strength.\n\u201cI wanted to tell you, but when I found out, I felt so sick. If I had told you, it would have been real.\u201d\nLadybug lifts her hand, but Adrien skitters away from her touch. He\u2019s never done that before.\n\u201cChat,\u201d she says softly. \u201cChat, what happened?\u201d\n\u201cI was sick this morning. He let me have the day off, but when I woke up, he was there, in my room, and he tried to convince me to hand my ring over.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t! I didn\u2019t. I promise I wouldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d\nLadybug grips Adrien\u2019s forearms. It\u2019s not a gentle touch, nothing like her soft eyes, and it draws Adrien away from a panic attack. Gives him something to focus on. Beneath her hands, it\u2019s easier to breathe.\n\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Ladybug says.\n\u201cHe tried to take it, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cBy force? Did he\u201d\u2014Ladybug looks like she might throw up\u2014\u201churt you?\u201d\n\u201cI got out of there as quickly as I could.\u201d Ladybug\u2019s mouth screws up, and Adrien knows she\u2019s trying not to cry. \u201cI just thought you needed to know. He knows who I am. He could be planning something.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to fight him?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because I needed to be side-lined.\u201d The akuma is still in the distance, a destructive vibration and an echo of screams. \u201cI told you so that we\u2019ll be ready.\u201d\nLadybug\u2019s hands run down from his arms and take his hands. Her face is twisted up. Adrien is sure his isn\u2019t much better. They don\u2019t make a reassuring image, he\u2019s sure\u2014two teenage heroes holding hands and trying not to break down crying.\n\u201cI won\u2019t let him hurt you,\u201d Ladybug says.\n\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cHe won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Ladybug and Chat Noir arrive on the scene, the akuma zeroes in on them. The butterfly symbol lights up her face.\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d she says softly. Adrien can almost hear his father\u2019s inflections in this stranger\u2019s words.\nLadybug steps in front of him. \u201cHawkmoth, enough. Stop this.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll stop when you surrender,\u201d says the akuma. \u201cWhen you hand over your miraculous. Then this can all be over, and we can go home.\u201d\n\u201cHow could you do this to\u2014\u201d\nAdrien puts a hand on Ladybug\u2019s shoulder, cutting her off. \u201cHawkmoth,\u201d he says in that same demure way he might normally say, Father. \u201cPlease. Can\u2019t we go back? Stop all of this, and just \u2026 \u201d\n\u201cThat is what I\u2019m trying to do. Can\u2019t you see that? This is for family.\u201d The akuma extends a hand in the same way father had extended his hand to Adrien this morning, pleading for him to step closer, to peacefully hand over his miraculous. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired? I see your pain. I see your loneliness. Come home, and this can be over.\u201d\nLadybug looks from the akuma to Adrien with wide eyes. Adrien doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking. Is she worried that he might believe Hawkmoth\u2019s words, and surrender his miraculous? Or maybe she thinks that her partner might abandon her, and join Hawkmoth.\nThat thought, more than his past experiences with both Father and Hawkmoth, more than the gentle words spoken through an akumatised civilian rather than from Father\u2019s own lips, makes his decision for him.\nAdrien pulls out his baton.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d the akuma says. It sounds like she\u2019s begging. \u201cDon\u2019t make me do this.\u201d\nAdrien shakes his head. There\u2019s a lump in his throat he can't dislodge.\nLadybug slots herself back into the conversation. As she speaks, she takes Adrien\u2019s hand in her own. \u201cWe won\u2019t let you keep terrorising innocent people. And we won\u2019t let you get our miraculous.\u201d\nThe akuma sighs. \u201cVery well.\u201d\nHawkmoth drops the possession. The akuma looks around, disorientated at the sudden autonomy over their own body, before the butterfly symbols flares again, reminding the akuma of its purpose.\n\u201cChat,\u201d Ladybug murmurs.\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Adrien says. He notices that they\u2019re still holding hands. They can\u2019t fight like that. He pulls his hand away, and wonders if he\u2019s imagining the flick of reluctance on Ladybug\u2019s face as she takes her hand back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe fight shuts down half the city.\nHawkmoth can\u2019t create multiple akumas at once, but he has worked up his stamina. After they purified one akuma, another crops up within the hour.\nThey break up to de-transform and feed their kwamis, and then, just as they\u2019re catching their breath, as they\u2019re beginning to head back out into the city, they hear news of the next akuma.\nAt the sight of the first akuma, Adrien is swallowed up by dread. At the second akuma, he\u2019s beginning to feel tired. At the third, his legs are shaking\nAfter the fourth akuma, Adrien slumps to the ground, splayed out like a starfish.\nThere shouldn\u2019t be civilians in this area, but, of course, Alya will do anything for a story.\nShe skids to a stop in front of him. Her camera is out, filming, even though it\u2019s school hours. Or\u2014is it school hours? He had seen her during their lunch break. How long ago had that been? How long had they been fighting?\nNino is a beat behind her, clearly out of breath. He hovers behind her, glancing at the prone akuma.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Adrien says.\nAlya waves a hand at where Ladybug is in the process of purifying the akuma. \u201cDangers passed. For now, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Adrien pushes himself into a sitting position, and fixes a welcoming smile onto his face. \u201cWhat can I do for you, citizen?\u201d\n\u201cI know you know my name,\u201d Alya says.\n\u201cHave you been following the akumas today?\u201d Adrien asks. \u201cAll of them?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want her to die,\u201d Nino says.\nAlya waves of their concern. \u201cI have to broadcast this. It\u2019s final boss time, right?\u201d\n\u201cFinal boss?\u201d Adrien asks.\n\u201cThe battle at the very end of the game. The final boss.\u201d She hoists her phone up, focussing it on the hero. \u201cChat Noir, what can you tell me about these fights?\u201d\n\u201cLet him be,\u201d Nino says, gesturing at where Adrien is flopped on the asphalt, sweaty and clearly exhausted. \u201cHey, man, are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cPawsitively purrfect,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d\nNino and Alya exchange looks. Nino opens his mouth to say something, maybe to scold him the same way he might when they were at school and Adrien was overworking himself again, rather than in the middle of a crumbling city street with a purified akuma. But then the swirl of ladybugs washes over them, fixing the deep holes in the asphalt, and a slow clapping starts up.\nAlya jerks back. Nino grips her arm, like he wants to shove her behind him. \u201cIs that\u2014\u201d Nino begins.\nAdrien pushes himself to his feet. His exhaustion is gone. His heart is racing.\nHawkmoth stands atop the nearby apartment building. Adrien doesn\u2019t recognise the purple suit, or the gunmetal grey mask. He doesn\u2019t recognise the long cane, the gloves, the sharp smile\u2014this man is a stranger, from head to toe.\n\u201cYou have fought admirably,\u201d Hawkmoth says, voice projected down to them. Alya is shaking, but her phone is pointed upward. How many people are watching her livestream? \u201cYour city commends you.\u201d\n\u201cHawkmoth,\u201d Ladybug says. \u201cCome to ask us to surrender again?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Hawkmoth looks at Adrien. He feels naked. \u201cI can see I took the wrong approach. You are too young to understand the full weight of your bullheadedness. The miraculouses should not be in the hands of naive children.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s better to be with you, who would use them for your own selfish purposes?\u201d\n\u201cMy purposes are not selfish.\u201d Hawkmoth steps off the edge of the building, and falls to the pavement. He lands gracefully. \u201cEnough talking. Are you willing to\u2014\u201d\nLadybug bares her teeth. \u201cNever.\u201d\nHawkmoth flicks his gaze to Adrien. There is no softness to be found in his face. Nothing welcoming or kind. Nothing resembling mercy.\nAdrien feels cold.\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d Hawkmoth says. \u201cHave you come to your senses?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Adrien says.\n\u201cI thought as much. You never make life easy for me, do you?\u201d\nLadybug\u2019s earrings beep. Her hand fly to cup them, and Hawkmoth laughs.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about your identity, child.\u201d\n\u201cGo,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cCome back as soon as you can.\u201d\nWith one last lingering glance at Adrien and the two civilians behind him, she dashes into a side alley.\nButterflies rise over the horizon, blocking out the sun. They buzz around Hawkmoth. He snatches one out of the air, and brings his palms together. When he opens his hands, a dark butterfly flitters into the air, a stain beside its white sisters.\nIt flies at Adrien, and skitters against his chest, like it\u2019s trying to find an opening for it to dip into, but his armoured suit is seamless and unwavering. The butterfly veers to the left. Alya and Nino shuffle closer to Adrien, but the butterfly ignores them, disappearing into the buildings behind them.\nAdrien looks at Hawkmoth. Had he just tried to akumatise him? Is that the way he would secure Adrien\u2019s cooperation\u2014by using dark magic to turn him into a blind puppet?\n\u201cI wonder who hasn\u2019t evacuated yet,\u201d Hawkmoth says. \u201cWith so many attacks in one day, the people must be feeling so helpless. It\u2019s a breeding ground for power.\u201d\nAlya pushes in front of Adrien. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep taking advantage of innocent people. The way you make vulnerable people fight your battles for you\u2014it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\u201cAlya,\u201d Nino hisses, \u201cdon\u2019t antagonise the super-villain.\u201d\nHawkmoth laughs. \u201cYou think I can\u2019t fight my own battles?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely what it looks like. You\u2019ve made puppets out of children\u2014out of babies, even\u2014and you still think you\u2019re all that?\u201d\nThe cane isn\u2019t for design. It isn\u2019t to help his perfectly fit father move around.\nIt\u2019s a sword.\nHawkmoth brandishes the blade at Alya. It glints in the afternoon sun, and Adrien is reminded of his father\u2019s fencing background. Not sword fighting. Fencing. The sport with blunted swords and a strict code of honour.\nAdrien shoves Alya behind him into Nino\u2019s waiting hands, and holds his baton in front of him. Hawkmoth scowls at him.\n\u201cIf I wanted to go after those two, I would have done so earlier.\u201d\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Alya begins. \u201cYou turned us into akuma, you cowardly piece of\u2014\u201d\nShe\u2019s cut off as Nino clamps a hand over her mouth. Adrien grits his teeth, and waits for the blade, held aloft, inches from his face, to strike him.\n\u201cI won\u2019t go after them,\u201d Hawkmoth says to Adrien. \u201cOut of courtesy to you, of course. They\u2019re important to you. I know that\u2014I care about that. Don\u2019t you see how much I care?\u201d\nAdrien\u2019s baton skirts the edge of the blade, knocking it away from his throat. \u201cIf you cared, you\u2019d stop this.\u201d\n\u201cSo strong,\u201d Hawkmoth says. \u201cSo courageous. Just like your mother. Don\u2019t you want to see her again?\u201d\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Alya says from behind him.\nThe words get caught in Adrien\u2019s throat. He has a thousand things he wants to say to his father, and he doesn't know how to say any of it. Or where to start.\n\u201cNot like this,\u201d Adrien says instead, and it isn\u2019t enough. It will never be enough. It doesn\u2019t change that strange almost-pity on his father\u2019s face.\nHawkmoth sheathes his sword. \u201cI see.\u201d\nThe city goes silent. Unnaturally silent. Adrien turns. An akuma in all white is floating above the city, her hands splayed. The city below them is slowly vanishing, piece by piece,\nWhen he turns back around, Hawkmoth is walking away. Like he was going for a stroll. Like he is unaffected by everything, even as Adrien\u2019s pulse throbs in his ears.\n\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d Alya says. Nino tries to calm Alya down, but she whirls on him. \u201cNo, Nino. You saw that weird \u2018come to the dark side, my son\u2019 shtick\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAre you?\u201d Nino asks Adrien, quieter. \u201cHis son?\u201d\n\u201cGet somewhere safe,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cI have an akuma to deal with.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe akuma is a young girl with sensory issues. The constant akuma attacks caused her a lot of pain, and now she wants to quiet the city. Patches of the city are eclipsed in silence. She freezes cars in the middle of the street. In other places, she has vanished people and uprooted entire parks\u2014taking anything that made noise, and getting rid of it.\nAdrien tries to fight her. He does his best, but she vanishes his baton. She throws up sound-sucking areas, and evaporates buildings from beneath his feet. And then, when he is trying to catch his breath, she tackles him. She pins his wrists. She isn\u2019t smiling like most akumas, in that smug, power-drunk way\u2014she wasn\u2019t smiling at all. Her face is blank. Hollow.\nLike a wooden puppet.\nHawkmoth isn\u2019t far off. Adrien suspects he was waiting on the wings, watching this fight unfurl. When Adrien is pinned, he makes a reappearance.\nHawkmoth\u2019s sword slips beneath his chin, settling against his neck. He isn\u2019t smiling either. Adrien opens his mouth to shout up at him\u2014to plead, maybe\u2014but no sound comes out.\nStop, Adrien says, mouth closing on nothing.\nHawkmoth flattens Adrien\u2019s hand against the asphalt, crushing his fingers in his effort to lay them flat. Adrien bucks, and tugs at his wrists, and shrieks up at him. Hawkmoth doesn\u2019t look at him; all his attention is on Adrien\u2019s hand.\nHe plucks the ring off his finger. Adrien de-transforms in a whirl of light. He\u2019s still wearing his pyjamas.\nHawkmoth laughs, and releases the akuma. Awareness comes over the girl like a car crash, and she scrambles away from Hawkmoth on all fours. He barely looks at her.\n\u201cLadybug will\u2014\u201d Adrien says.\nHawkmoth\u00a0holds up the earrings, glinting in the light, and Adrien\u2019s inside freeze over.\nHe wasn\u2019t waiting in the sidelines. Adrien wants to shake himself, wants to scream\u2014of course Father would never patiently sit by. He was tracking down Ladybug.\n\u201cCaught her just as she transformed,\u201d Hawkmoth says. \u201cRemarkable that Paris\u2019s two superheroes were both in the same class. Did you know?\u201d He inspects Adrien\u2019s face, and clicks his tongue. \u201cI guess not.\u201d\n\u201cFather,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m doing this for you,\u201d Hawkmoth says. \u201cI can bring your mother back home.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Adrien says, so quiet it\u2019s barely audible, but Hawkmoth doesn\u2019t listen.\nThe ring and earrings slot together like magnets, and for a moment, everything is quiet.\nThen the combined miraculous are ringed in scorching light, leaving sun-spots in Adrien\u2019s vision. Hawkmoth lifts off the ground, and ascends into the sky. The light spreads, encircling him in its celestial glow. He floats above the city, more blinding then the smoke-hazy sun.\nHawkmoth waves a hand, and the asphalt cracks open, a gaping chasm splitting the city street. Cars slide into the hole. Buildings list, and then topple. People, screaming, grasping at nothing, are pulled into the crack.\nHawkmoth\u2019s business suit is gone, replaced by seamless purple and fissures of sun-like light. He extends a hand, and a row of apartment buildings fold in on themselves.\nNino hits the ground by Adrien\u2019s side, skinning his jeans. His hands clamp down on Adrien\u2019s shoulders and shake him.\nWhen did Nino get here? Adrien stares at his friend in a daze. Everything feels like it\u2019s been swathed in cotton wool, like all the heat has been drained from the city. (Shock, Adrien will later learn. This is shock.)\n\u201cAdrien, we have to go,\u201d Nino says, frantic. \u201cWe have to move.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cAre you hurt? Did you fuck up your leg?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m.\u201d Adrien chokes on the words. He swallows, and tries again, \u201cNino, I\u2019m Chat Noir.\u201d\nNino\u2019s hands slide off his shoulders. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nAlya shoves Nino to the side. \u201cWe have to get out of here. What\u2019s the hold up?\u201d\n\u201cI have to stop him,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cI have to stop Hawkmoth.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Nino says.\n\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Alya says. \u201cHe\u2019s going to decimate Paris. He has the miraculouses. It\u2019s over. We lost.\u201d\nShe\u2019s crying. Or she was, at some point. Her face is puffy and raw, and her hair is scraped back into a lopsided bun. She has someone slung over her shoulders. It\u2019s Marinette. He can\u2019t see her face; he can only see the ribbons falling out of her ponytails, her pink jeans dirtied with soot, and the growing patch of blood on her shoulder.\nAdrien looks away from his classmate. He can only help her by doing this one thing. This one awful thing.\n\u201cI\u2019m Chat Noir,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cThis is my fault. It\u2019s my responsibility. I have to stop him.\u201d\n\u201cSo that means\u2014\u201d Nino looks at Hawkmoth\u2019s glowing form. \u201cThat means he really is your dad.\u201d Adrien nods, and Nino sucks in a deep breath. He claps a hand on Adrien\u2019s shoulder again. He looks like he wants to envelop Adrien in a hug and stay there, folded up on the asphalt, but there\u2019s no time for that. \u201cI always knew that guy was a jackass.\u201d\nThe revelation barely touches Alya. She shows no surprise. No panic. She just scowls at him, and clicks her fingers under his nose. \u201cHe\u2019ll kill you. Are you listening to me? That thing up there\u2014\u201d She points up at Hawkmoth. \u201c\u2014will kill you. It\u2019s not your dad anymore.\u201d\n\u201cAlya,\u201d Nino says.\n\u201cNo. I won\u2019t let you get yourself killed.\u201d\nThe stink of rotten eggs clogs the air. The cracks running through the city have burst the gas lines and sewage pipes. Plumes of smoke rise over the horizon.\n\u201cIf we can find Ladybug,\u201d Adrien begins.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d Alya hefts Marinette\u2019s unconscious form further up her back. \u201cWe have Ladybug.\u201d\n\u201cHawkmoth might have taken her earrings, but I know Ladybug. She wouldn\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\u201cNo, dude,\u201d Nino says. \u201cWe stumbled into an alleyway to hide in, and we found Marinette, and then Hawkmoth found us, just as she transformed \u2026 \u201d\nNino trails off, face pinched, but Alya looks even angrier. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be okay. She will. No matter what that asshole did to her. Once we get out of the city, and Marinette wakes up\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMarinette?\u201d Adrien says. Nino and Alya look at him. Adrien\u2019s mouth is dry. \u201cYou mean that Marinette is\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Nino says.\nMarinette is Ladybug. Ladybug is here, unconscious and bleeding steadily from a cut on her shoulder, her hair matted with blood.\nThat means Adrien has spent his days in class, oblivious to Ladybug\u2019s presence. It means he knows her. Or maybe it means he doesn\u2019t know her at all.\nIt means Nino and Alya can carry her to safety. It means Adrien can continue on without worrying about her. It means he is alone in this.\nNino pulls Adrien to his feet, and tugs him away from where Hawkmoth is posed over the city, a vengeful god eclipsing the sun.\nAdrien shakes Nino off. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cAdrien,\u201d Nino says.\n\u201cCarry him,\u201d Alya says. \u201cHe\u2019s in shock. He\u2019s going to get himself killed.\u201d\nNino tries to grab him, but Adrien dodges. Hawkmoth hasn\u2019t hurt him. Without his miraculous, Adrien is fever-slow and exhausted, but he isn\u2019t injured like the other three are.\nAdrien says, \u201cI\u2019m the only one that can do this.\u201d\nHe spares one last look at Marinette. Ladybug. There is no time to process that fully, and no time to look at her once more, to look at those familiar blue eyes and her freckles\u2014the freckles that the mask had always hidden\u2014and see Ladybug. His partner. His best friend.\n\u201cHe won\u2019t hurt me,\u201d Adrien tells them. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\nAnd then he turns and runs before either of them can physically restrain him, ignoring their hoarse shouts for him to come back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe damage grows worse the farther Adrien runs. Hawkmoth has burnt his way through the city. He has carved chasms into roads, levelled parks until nothing is left but mirror-like tar, and knifed entire buildings.\nAdrien sees groups of people in some areas, running full tilt away from Hawkmoth. Some of them call out to him. To them, he\u2019s a teenager in his pyjamas running through the middle of a burning wasteland. Not their hero.\nIn other parts of the city, there\u2019s nothing. No one. The ground is burnt flat. The rubble from the buildings that once stood here have been turned into ash. There\u2019s no noise here, save for Hawkmoth\u2019s power, like a thunderclap in the distance.\nAdrien runs, stopping only to throw up, or catch his breath.\nThe raw destruction doesn\u2019t last; an hour after it the miraculouses were joined, Hawkmoth begins to sink back to earth.\nWhen Adrien reaches him, Hawkmoth is twisting silvery spirals in the air. The ground is burnt around him in a perfect circle.\nAdrien approaches carefully. \u201cFather. It\u2019s me.\u201d\nHawkmoth\u2019s head swivels to look at him. His eyes are a pupil-less sheen of gold. Adrien\u2019s joints lock up; he has never felt so small before.\nHelicopters circle them overhead. Adrien doesn\u2019t look away from Hawkmoth to check if they belong to the police or the press.\n\u201cYou\u2019re destroying Paris,\u201d Adrien says.\nHawkmoth looks around, like he\u2019s seeing the destruction for the first time. \u201cI have power, now. The power to bring her back.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Adrien says, because arguing with his father normally makes things worse; doing so now would bring France to ruin. \u201cLet\u2019s do that. Let\u2019s forget Paris and\u2014and do that.\u201d\nThe silver spirals thicken. Mist-like glitter forms shapes. Arms. Then hands. Then a face.\n\u201cLet\u2019s do that,\u201d says Hawkmoth.\nMum solidifies on the blackened ground. She palms at the layers of ash, and sucks air into her new lungs.\nAdrien crosses to her. The distance feels enormous, suddenly, even though he just ran from one side of Paris to the other with a cold. He collapses by her side.\nShe\u2019s beautiful. Younger than he remembers, maybe only twenty, but still familiar. She touches Adrien gently, like she\u2019s scared he\u2019s not real, and then pulls him to her chest.\nHis face presses against her neck. She\u2019s warm. She doesn\u2019t smell like the vanilla perfume he remembers. She smells like iron.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\nAdrien makes himself look beyond her dewey face to the ash dirtying her slacks. He makes himself think about Paris breaking to pieces under Hawkmoth\u2019s hands. Alya and Nino, dirt-streaked and terrified. Marinette. His lady, hanging limply over Alya\u2019s shoulder, steadily dripping blood.\nAdrien pulls away from Mum\u2019s embrace. It\u2019s one of the hardest things he has ever done. Will ever do.\nIt hurts to look at Hawkmoth. He\u2019s barely coherent, staring at Mum with vacant relief. He\u2019s crying.\nBut Hawkmoth\u2019s eyes are glazed over. The power isn\u2019t going to let Hawkmoth go.\nThe light encircling Hawkmoth has brightened. The joined miraculous twitch against his chest. It\u2019s so small, to have caused so much death.\nAdrien dives. Hawkmoth reaches for him. Adrien knows that, in this moment, Hawkmoth would snap his neck; crush his skull; burn the skin off his face. Adrien\u2019s hands close around the joined miraculouses. It thrums under his palm like it recognises him.\nHawkmoth\u2019s fingers brush his temples as Adrien digs his fingers in and yanks the miraculouses apart.\nThe light fades abruptly. Hawkmoth collapses onto the ashy ground on his knees. Adrien pants, holding the ring and earrings to his chest.\nPlagg and Tikki float out of the miraculouses, and huddle against Adrien\u2019s pyjama shirt. They\u2019re shaking.\n\u201cAdrien,\u201d Plagg says. \u201cKid.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d\nHawkmoth tips his head up. Adrien had thought it was difficult this morning, his father raising his hand to him like a beggar, or later, when he used the akuma as a mouthpiece to beg Adrien to come home\u2014but that was nothing compared to this. Father\u2019s face is twisted up in pain. He\u2019s still crying.\nHe looks pathetic and small, and Adrien wants to collapse into the burnt ground, sandwiched between his two parents.\n\u201cWe can be a family again,\u201d Hawkmoth says. Adrien desperately wants to believe him. \u201cWe can, Adrien. We can. But how do we know this is permanent? I need that power to keep her here. To stop anyone from killing your mother again.\u201d\nMum stands. She shakes like a newborn lamb.\n\u201cMy love,\u201d Hawkmoth says. He reaches out slowly, like he\u2019s afraid of touching her. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt yourself.\u201d\n\u201cGabriel.\u201d It\u2019s the first thing she has said. \u201cGabriel, what have you done?\u201d\nHe collapses onto her, tangling her up in a hug. She lets him cry into her shoulder.\nAdrien distances himself from them. If he stays, if he crouches down beside them, he won\u2019t be able to get back up again. The miraculouses are warm against his palm, reminding him of his responsibility.\n\u201cPlagg,\u201d he says, \u201chow are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cI feel as bad as you look,\u201d Plagg says, \u201cbut if there was ever a time to dig deep, now is it.\u201d\nStill in view of Hawkmoth and Mum, still in the blacken circle burnt into the earth where buildings and asphalt once were, Adrien pulls his ring on, and says, \u201cPlagg, claws out.\u201d\nThe transformation draws Hawkmoth\u2019s gaze. He jerks out of Mum\u2019s hold, and bares his teeth like a hunted animal. He draws his sword from the scabbard at his hip.\n\u201cGabriel.\u201d Mum scrambles for him, but he pushes her back. She\u2019s weak. Hawkmoth is right; the transformation doesn\u2019t look complete. Is she even completely there, or is she a mirage, a shadow of her former self?\nAdrien pulls out his baton. The suit helps him feel strong. Helps him feel less like he\u2019s single-handedly destroying his world with this one gesture.\nHawkmoth rushes him. Their weapons clash, and their boots dig into the ash. The helicopters circle above like hungry birds.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHawkmoth is the superior swordsman, but he\u2019s desperate. He focusses on pushing Adrien back with strength, rather than using his experience and skill against him.\nHawkmoth is beating him. Adrien\u2019s hands are numb, each attack ricochetting painfully up his arm.\nAdrien turns and runs when he has an opening. If he can get the earrings somewhere safe, or if he can get to higher ground, reduce the height advantage Hawkmoth has on him\u2014\nAlya pokes her head out of an alleyway, and flags him down. Adrien skids in after her, and is almost bowled over by Marinette\u2019s hug.\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay,\u201d Marinette says into his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that again.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to smack you when this is all over,\u201d Alya agrees.\n\u201cSame,\u201d Nino says from where he\u2019s crouched against the bricks. \u201cI was so scared. I still am. I thought your old man was going to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe won\u2019t let him,\u201d Marinette says, pulling away. She\u2019s still bloody, but she looks strong.\n\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d Adrien asks. \u201cI thought you were evacuating with everyone else.\u201d\nNino holds up his phone. \u201cThe choppers are livestreaming the whole thing. They were talking about calling in the army before you grabbed the miraculouses.\u201d\nLivestreaming. All of Paris, maybe all of France, all of Europe, saw his father\u2019s rampage through Paris. They saw Mum\u2019s return. They saw Adrien\u2019s transformation into Chat Noir.\nAdrien feels nothing at the realisation. It\u2019s hard to care about the world knowing when his world, his small, intimate world, is already burning.\nAdrien hands Marinette the earrings. \u201cI know you\u2019re injured, but Hawkmoth isn\u2019t going to give up. I can\u2019t do this without you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m by your side,\u201d Marinette says. \u201cAlways. Tikki, spots on.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s easy with Ladybug there. Easier than a normal akuma, even.\nIt feels wrong, somehow. After years of fighting akumas; after weeks of lonely, hungry stress; after a day of panic, and pain, and blood, it shouldn\u2019t be so easy to bring Hawkmoth down.\nBut he\u2019s exhausted, too. He\u2019s scorched from the power-surge of the joined miraculous. He\u2019s drained from his wife\u2019s return.\nThe lucky charm is a reel of fishing wire. In the fight, Hawkmoth is tangled in the fishing wire and stumbles, pinned in an awkward position while Ladybug holds the wire taunt. Adrien reaches down, and takes the brooch.\nHawkmoth\u2019s transformation dissolves, leaving Gabriel Agreste twisted up in the dirt.\nLadybug holds the red fishing wire in her hand. Father scrambles for her.\n\u201cDon\u2019t. Please don't reverse it all. My wife\u2014Adrien\u2019s mother\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThousands of people died,\u201d Ladybug says.\n\u201cMy wife,\u201d Father says.\nLadybug looks at Adrien. He stares at the ground. There was a park here once, he thinks. Now, there is only black dirt. No trees. No life. Only ash.\n\u201cDo it,\u201d he says around the tightness in his chest.\nLadybug throws the fishing wire into the air. \u201cLucky charm!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe city looks like nothing has happened. Lucky charm rebuilds buildings and roads. It sucks the smoke out of the sky. It brings back thousands of people in a wash of pink light, standing where they had died.\nIt takes away Mum.\nThe police come. They don\u2019t normally, after an akuma attack. Akuma victims are usually ushered into the back of ambulances and treated for shock.\nGabriel Agreste is pinned on the newly formed grass by three officers and handcuffed. He\u2019s read his rights. He looks past the police officers to Adrien.\n\u201cI brought her back. I brought her home. How could you kill her again?\u201d Father is wild-eyed. Adrien can\u2019t say anything in response; his mouth is too dry. \u201cI did this for us. I did this for you.\u201d\nAdrien isn\u2019t sure that that\u2019s true.\nIt would be better\u2014easier\u2014to believe that Father did something terrible for him. Adrien could swallow that Father killed for him, that he burnt half of Paris to ash, than to believe he hadn\u2019t thought about Adrien at all when he was doing this.\nMaybe that makes Adrien selfish. Maybe it makes him a bad person. He wouldn\u2019t be surprised; it seems like that kind of mindset runs in the family.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Agreste mansion is a monolith in the centre of Paris. It looks like a museum.\nThey jump over the fence and land in the brick courtyard. Adrien hesitates, staring at the closed doors. No PA system crackles to life to scold them. The doors don\u2019t burst open to reveal Nathalie glowering down at them.\nDid she know? Did the Gorilla? Was this one big inside joke that everyone but Adrien was in on?\nLadybug takes his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re holding my hand,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve been doing it a lot today.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mind?\u201d\nHe tightens his grip on her hand. She squeezes back. He can\u2019t help but look at their intertwined hands, the red against black leather. He doesn\u2019t know how he would have survived this without her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d he murmurs.\nThey are there to get his things. The press haven\u2019t swarmed yet, but it\u2019s only a matter of time before half of Paris is outside the mansion, trying to bring down the gates.\nThe house is cold inside, like no one has lived there for years. They don\u2019t run into any staff. Father probably gave them all the day off.\nLadybug holds his hand until they get to his bedroom, and then only lets go so he can pack everything. He doesn\u2019t drop the transformation. He doesn\u2019t want to do this as Adrien Agreste. If he\u2019s Chat Noir, then it\u2019s not real. He can pretend this is for the mission.\nHe packs up his school books, his toiletries, his photographs, and his clothes. He picks up a muted orange shirt from the latest Gabriel collection, and thinks, There won\u2019t be another line of Gabriel clothing ever again.\nHe grabs his wallet and then goes to father\u2019s office. He takes some of his personal documents, like his birth certificate and passport. He knows he must be leaving behind important things, but he\u2019s sixteen, and he doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s important and what\u2019s not. Father always handled everything. Does Adrien have any money, now? Does he have no money\u2014all the money?\n\u201cReady to go?\u201d Ladybug asks. She hasn\u2019t said anything since they stepped inside the mansion.\n\u201cThe book,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cThe one about the miraculous users. It\u2019s in a safe. I don\u2019t know the combination; Plagg got it out last time.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d He doesn\u2019t drop the transform. He just stares up at Mum\u2019s portrait, hands loose by his side, eyes this side too blank, so Ladybug says, \u201cTikki, spots off.\u201d\nMarinette emerges from the wash of pink light. Tikki flies over to Adrien. She nuzzles the underside of his chin, her antenna tickling his throat.\n\u201cOh, Adrien,\u201d Tikki says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d\nHe pushes her away gently. \u201cThe safe is just through there. Plagg floated through the safe door. Can you do that?\u201d\nTikki retrieves the book and a photo of Mum. Adrien tucks both into his bag.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Marinette asks. Adrien shakes his head. \u201cTikki, spots on.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t until Adrien is stepping out of the mansion doors that he realises he has no where to go. All he knows is that he can\u2019t stay at the mansion.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ladybug asks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do now,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cWhere can I go?\u201d\nLadybug laces their hands together, pulling on his fingers. \u201cIs that all? You\u2019re coming me, obviously.\u201d She pauses, and then wrenches her hand away. \u201cI mean, uh, if you want to! Nino wanted you to come home with him, but I said you should come with me, since we\u2019re partners and I know more about what you\u2019ve been through\u2014not that I do really, of course! It\u2019s terrible, what happened, and I know I don\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t\u2014no one could possibly understand\u2014\u201d\nHe pulls her back. He doesn\u2019t ever want to let go of her hand. \u201cI\u2019d like to go with you, if your parents don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nLadybug shakes her head. \u201cThey\u2019re worried about you, too.\u201d\n\u201cIs it weird, now that you know who I am?\u201d Adrien sucks in a breath. Will he ever stop feeling so fragile, like there\u2019s a hole punched through his chest? \u201cDo you resent it?\u201d\n\u201cI think I might still be in shock. I didn\u2019t get to process when I found out you were Adrien, but you\u2019re still my best friend. My partner. You\u2019re still everything to me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStop,\u201d Adrien says, because if she keeps going, he\u2019s going to lose it. He doesn\u2019t want to break down crying here.\n\u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d she says gently. Always so gentle.\n\u201cReady to never come back,\u201d Adrien says, even if he knows it\u2019s a lie. He\u2019ll probably\u00a0have to come back here one day, even if it\u2019s only to pick up more of his things. (And a part of him\u2014a not-so-small, indisputable part of him wants to stay here, wants to be frog-marched back inside by Nathalie or the Gorilla and see his father standing at the top of the stairs, waiting for him.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMarinette\u2019s parents stare at the two teenagers in their entryway. They\u2019re not injured. They\u2019re not even dirty. But the way they\u2019re standing, leaning against each other, like they don\u2019t have the strength to stand upright, would alarm any parent. Any attentive parent.\nMarinette and Adrien are bustled into the living room and towards the couch.\n\u201cAre you alright? We were so worried\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re fine, Mum,\u201d Marinette says.\nTom disappears into the kitchen, and comes back with water and a plate of pastries. He lays them on the coffee table, and takes a seat beside his wife.\n\u201cWe just saw what happened on the news,\u201d he begins.\nMarinette glances at her partner. Adrien stares at his shoes, until Tom touches his shoulder, and says, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nAdrien stares at him. \u201cUh.\u201d\n\u201cYou can stay here,\u201d Sabine says. \u201cFor as long as you want.\u201d\n\u201cPermanently,\u201d Tom says, \u201cif that\u2019s what you want. We don\u2019t have much space, but we can make it work.\u201d\nAdrien doesn\u2019t move to pick up a pastry, even though he hasn\u2019t eaten since last night. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me,\u201d he says, quiet and wondrous. \u201cHow could you \u2026 ?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re Marinette\u2019s friend. She talks about you a lot.\u201d\n\u201cDad!\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen what Chat Noir has done for Paris these past years, protecting us all,\u201d Tom goes on.\nAdrien swallows, his mouth dry. It\u2019s going to take a while to adjust to people referring to him as Chat Noir when he\u2019s not transformed.\n\u201cAnd even if we didn\u2019t know who you were, you would still be welcome here,\u201d Sabine says gently. They\u2019re both so gentle. Adrien doesn\u2019t know how to handle it.\nIs this where Ladybug\u2019s kindness came from? It\u2019s easy to look at these adults, smiling, giving them space, providing them with food and water and a roof above his head for as long as he wants to have one, and see Ladybug\u2019s unwavering brand of heroism.\nTom nods. \u201cYou\u2019re a good kid. You deserve to have someplace to come home to.\u201d\nHome.\nIt\u2019s hard to talk, suddenly. His throat is blocked up with tears. They move their attention to Marinette, giving Adrien and his damp eyes some time to think.\n\u201cAnd are you okay, Marinette?\u201d Sabine asks.\u201cI got somewhere safe with Alya and Nino,\u201d Marinette says. She doesn\u2019t tell them where Adrien was. She doesn\u2019t need to. Is there anyone in Paris that doesn\u2019t know by now? \u201cDid both of you evacuate?\u201d\nTom and Sabine hesitate, glancing at each other. They're holding hands. It reminds Adrien of him and Marinette, tangling their fingers together, finding strength in the other\u2019s warmth.\n\u201cLadybug\u2019s lucky charm fixed everything,\u201d Tom says, not quite looking at them. \u201cThat\u2019s what matters.\u201d\nMarinette\u2019s hand flies to her mouth. Adrien\u2019s insides feel cold. Their bakery would have been near the centre of all the chaos. If they hadn\u2019t evacuated, then \u2026\nAdrien remembers the blackened earth. In some places, the destruction had been so great that there hadn\u2019t even been rubble from the fallen buildings. There hadn\u2019t even been corpses. Everything had been reduced to ash.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Adrien says. His hand pulls at the hem of his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I should\u2019ve\u2014I should\u2019ve realised sooner, or I should\u2019ve\u2014\u201d\nMarinette grabs for his hand again. Sabine lays a hand on his shaking knee.\n\u201cYou listen to me, okay?\u201d Tom says, leaning forward in his seat. He maintains eye contact with Adrien. It doesn\u2019t burn, like eye contact sometimes does. It doesn\u2019t make him feel like a corned prey animal, staring up at a predator poised at the top of the marble staircase. Instead, it makes him feel grounded. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t your fault. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s my dad.\u201d Adrien is crying. That\u2019s where the shakes are coming from. The sobs start in his chest, taking up all the room in his lungs, and he folds in on himself. \u201cHe\u2019s my dad, and he killed you. He killed so many people.\u201d\n\u201cYou fixed it, Adrien. You were so brave\u2014we\u2019re so proud of how strong you were, standing up to him. You saved so many people. Including us.\u201d\nAdrien shakes his head. \u201cLadybug did that.\u201d\n\u201cYou got the miraculouses back,\u201d Marinette says.\nAdrien glowers at his knees. \u201cBut I knew.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Marinette says.\n\u201cI knew my father was Hawkmoth.\u201d He doesn\u2019t look at the Dupain-Chengs. He can\u2019t. \u201cI found out a few weeks ago. I was going to tell Ladybug, but I couldn\u2019t. Telling her would\u2019ve made it real. It would mean that I\u2019d have to fight my father, and I didn\u2019t think I could do that.\u201d His shoulders curl in on themselves. He feels so small. He\u2019s felt like this since he first stumbled into that high ceilinged room weeks ago, and saw the mass of white butterflies. \u201cI was so stupid.\u201d\nMarinette grips his hand tighter. \u201cYou\u2019re not stupid.\u201d\n\u201cYou probably should have told Ladybug,\u201d Tom allows, \u201cbut keeping quiet doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. You were scared.\u201d\n\u201cI should have done something, at least. I knew how much Mum\u2019s disappearance affected him. I should have helped him, tried to talk some sense into him.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re just a kid, Adrien. And he\u2019s your dad. He should be looking out for you, not the other way around.\u201d\nTom Dupain would know, Adrien thinks. He\u2019s a dad. He\u2019s the kind of dad Adrien had thought only existed on TV.\nAdrien wipes at his wet face, staring at his knees. His head is a mess.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s probably time for bed,\u201d Tom says. \u201cYou kids go get ready. I\u2019ll fetch the blow up mattress for Adrien.\u201d\nThey let him sleep in Marinette\u2019s room. They inflate a blow up mattress, and layer it with pillows and blankets. Before they go, they sweep both Marinette and Adrien into hugs. When they let go and head back downstairs, Adrien stands in the middle of Marinette\u2019s bedroom, staring after them. He feels like crying again.\nAdrien sits down on the mattress, and pulls out his phone. There are too many notifications. Some he recognises (Chloe must have left up to a hundred voicemails), but most, he doesn\u2019t.\nHe\u2019ll have to get a new number.\nMarinette sits down beside him. Their thighs brush. It\u2019s quiet in her room. It feels like all of Paris is quiet. Was it only hours ago that the whole world was burning?\nMarinette. Ladybug. Her pyjamas are pink, and her hair is in twin braids. Plagg settles in his hair. Tikki curls up against his neck. The four of them lay like that, curled up around Adrien, too exhausted to speak, until he falls asleep.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChloe storms the bakery three days after Hawkmoth almost destroys Paris. Adrien has made sure to stay clear of the shop proper so none of the customers will recognise him and out his location to the press. Somehow, though, Chloe has tracked him down.\nHe\u2019s asleep in Marinette\u2019s room, bundled up on the blow up mattress on the floor, when her voice wakes him up.\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you hide him away any longer. He\u2019s my friend. I deserve to see him, after all the garbage that\u2019s been on TV.\u201d\nShe barges into Marinette\u2019s room, the last place she would ever willingly be. She looks around, grimacing, before zeroing in on Adrien.\n\u201cAdrien, honey.\u201d She pulls herself up from the trapdoor and jumps onto his blow up mattress, making him bounce. \u201cWhat are you doing in bed?\u201d\n\u201cSleeping?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s lunchtime. Beauty sleep is one thing, but this moping is just sad. Come on, get up. You can stay with me. I won\u2019t make you sleep on the floor.\u201d\nAdrien twists out of her hold. \u201cI like it here. Marinette\u2019s family is really nice, and unless they want me to go\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe want you to stay,\u201d Marinette blurts beside the trapdoor. She doesn\u2019t redden; she\u2019s been getting better at staying composed after a few days of Adrien sleeping in her bedroom.\nChloe glowers at her. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t keep me from seeing him, at least. I had to look everywhere to try and find you, Adrikins. I had to go to Nino Lahiffe\u2019s apartment in person. Can you believe that?\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone where I am,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cPlease, Chloe. I haven\u2019t been watching the news\u2014no one\u2019s really let me, honestly\u2014but I know everyone is probably looking for me. And I don\u2019t think I can do that. Not right now.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d Her glare softens until she looks almost gentle, scanning his face\u2014his red eyes, blanket marks on his cheeks, face blotchy beneath tangled hair\u2014before she turns back to Marinette and scowls. \u201cI don\u2019t hoard my friends, unlike some people!\u201d\nChloe stays the rest of the day. Somehow, she coaxes him out of bed and downstairs. She sits by him, and chatters about everything and also nothing. She doesn\u2019t mention his father. She doesn\u2019t even talk about how scared she was when Hawkmoth tore through the city on Thursday.\nChloe pauses, halfway through instagraming a plate of strawberry eclairs. \u201cWill this give you away?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you have no reason to visit the bakery,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cEveryone knows you don\u2019t get on well with Marinette.\u201d\n\u201cBut I do adore you. That\u2019s a give away.\u201d Chloe huffs and deletes the image. \u201cThis \u2018being considerate\u2019 thing is hard work. How do you do it?\u201d\nAdrien blinks at her. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cAre you in it for the fun costume? Because Adrien, honey, the catsuit isn\u2019t nearly as trendy as the other things you wear. It\u2019s a little slutty, to be honest. I support you and this apparent sluttiness, but is it worth the hard work?\u201d Adrien stares at her. She points her phone at him. \u201cNo, I see. It\u2019s obviously Ladybug. I would become a hero just to see her, too, even if it sounds like a lot of grunt work.\u201d\n\u201cChloe,\u201d Adrien says, \u201cWhat?\u201d\nChloe doesn\u2019t look at him. She picks up a strawberry eclair and squeezes it, grimacing as filling spills over her fingers. \u201cIt sounds exhausting\u2014being selfless and brave like Chat Noir. Putting other people first. Saving lives no matter the personal cost.\u201d She sticks her fingers into her mouth, frowning. \u201cAnd sweaty! Ugh, your suit must be so disgusting after running all over Paris.\u201d\nShe looks away from him. Her face is scrunched up, like she\u2019s sucking on a lemon, not on sugary icing.\n\u201cChloe,\u201d Adrien says again. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that my hero collection is lacking. I had to stay up all night ordering merchandise. The cute, expensive kind of merchandise, not the homemade crap off of Etsy.\u201d Chloe slides her phone over to Adrien. Her photo gallery is open. It\u2019s full of screenshots\u2014screenshots of Chat Noir merchandise.\nAnd then, Adrien is laughing. It\u2019s hiccuping and not flattering, but it\u2019s laughter\u2014he hasn\u2019t laughed in weeks.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to buy all this, Chloe. You don\u2019t even like Chat Noir.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s my favourite superhero,\u201d she says indignantly, and then pauses. \u201cWell. Almost my favourite superhero.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know you have a huge crush on Ladybug. She\u2019s great.\u201d\nHe scrubs a hand through his knotted hair. Chloe had complained about his appearance, but she hasn\u2019t left. She hasn\u2019t wrestled him into better clothes or made fun of him. She\u2019s here, and she\u2019s trying so hard to make an effort.\nBeing here, in Marinette\u2019s living room, eating her pastries, watching Chloe\u2019s stiff shoulders as she talks about expensive Chat Noir merch, knowing Nino and Alya are coming over later to see him\u2014it makes him feel warm, where he\u2019s been feeling cold for weeks. It makes him feel like everything could be okay again.\n\u201cLadybug is so perfect,\u201d Chloe says. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect, too, of course, but Ladybug is \u2026 \u201d\nThey both sigh dreamily.\n\u201cThis is weird,\u201d Marinette says from the doorway. Adrien flushes. Chloe\u2014aware of Adrien\u2019s identity, but oblivious to Marinette\u2019s\u2014sticks her tongue out at her.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Monday, four days after Hawkmoth\u2019s arrest, Adrien wakes to a stone in his stomach.\nTikki hovers in front of him. Plagg is still curled in the collar of his pyjama shirt, snoring.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this,\u201d Adrien says quietly, fidgeting with the thick blankets.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay, Adrien,\u201d Tikki says. \u201cYou\u2019re stronger than you give yourself credit for. And your friends will be with you the entire time.\u201d\n\u201cI just want to crawl back under the covers and sleep all day.\u201d\n\u201cThe sooner you go back to school, the sooner everything will feel normal again.\u201d\nPlagg rolls out of Adrien\u2019s shirt and yawns, bobbing in the air. \u201cOptimism only gets you so far, Tikki. We all know that things can\u2019t just \u2018go back to normal.\u2019\u201d\nTikki scowls at him. \u201cI know they can\u2019t, but the sooner Adrien and Marinette do everyday things and settle into a routine, the sooner they\u2019ll be able to feel like themselves again.\u201d\nPlagg rolls his eyes and flies up to perch in Adrien\u2019s bedhead. \u201cDon\u2019t put pressure on them to snap back to normal. Recovery isn\u2019t a straight line.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than staying holed up in here and being pessimistic.\u201d\nAdrien gets up before the two kwamis can bicker anymore. He gathers up some clothes and gets dressed in the bathroom. The hair product he normally uses is still at the Agreste mansion. There\u2019s no one to scold him for leaving the house with his hair looking messy, either, but Adrien would rather not draw more attention to the fact that he\u2019s Chat Noir. He pulls Plagg out of his hair, runs the comb under the tap, and tries to flatten his hair out. He\u2019s partway successful.\nWhen Marinette finally wakes up after a lot of prodding and a gentle reminder from Tikki that Adrien needs her, today of all days, they go downstairs and have sausage and eggs for breakfast. Not porridge. Not watery oatmeal. Adrien\u2019s stomach is tied up in knots, but he asks for seconds, just so he can hear Mrs. Cheng say yes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdrien is reminded of his first day at public school, when he was nearly mobbed by students on the short walk to the classroom. But, this time, it\u2019s worse.\nThe police have cleared the front of the school of reporters by the time Adrien and Marinette arrive. Adrien waves shyly at the officers hovering in front of school grounds, and receives several knowing smiles and waves back.\nWhen they jog into the school proper, there\u2019s a moment of silence, everyone digesting his presence, and then Adrien is surrounded by students. They\u2019re all talking at once. Adrien glances from one face to another. His palms are sweaty. He thought he was prepared for this, but his chest is tight, and he\u2019s lost sight of Marinette, and he can barely feel Plagg pressing up against his chest beneath his sweater.\nAnd then Chloe is there, barring her teeth, threatening to have her father arrest every single one of them. She grabs Adrien around the arm, and bodily drags him out of the crowds. Adrien barely notices Kim and Ivan jumping in front of the crowd, and standing resolutely between Adrien and the other students.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like them,\u201d Chloe begins, \u201cbut your little friends at least recognise how impressive I am.\u201d\nAdrien blinks. \u201cThey sent you in after me?\u201d\nChloe drags them over to Nino, Alya, and Marinette. Adrien receives a fresh wave of hugs. Chloe clings to him all the way to class. Adrien is grateful; this way, no one can tell how much he\u2019s clinging back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe city gives Ladybug and Chat Noir awards.\nAdrien isn\u2019t sure how much of it is Chloe influencing her father, or Mayor Bourgeois wanting to cash in on the heroes\u2019 popularity, but a week after Hawkmoth burns half of Paris to ash, Marinette and Adrien stand in front of city hall in full costume while Mayor Bourgeois hangs medals around their necks.\nAdrien ignores the sea of cameras and the black hole in his chest, and instead focusses on the way the medal looks against Marinette\u2019s collarbones, like she was born to wear to it. He focusses on Chloe off to one side, preening like she\u2019s the one receiving an award. He focusses on Paris behind them, whole and untarnished, as though untouched by the Agreste family.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdrien quits his extracurricular lessons. Fencing, Chinese, piano\u2014it all feels pointless right now. He might go back to fencing, one day. It was the only thing he really enjoyed.\nHe\u2019s offered a hundred different modelling jobs. Companies he\u2019s worked with, companies he\u2019s never even heard of\u2014all of them want Adrien Agreste, the victimised son, or Chat Noir, the suave superhero.\nAdrien quits modelling, too.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNathalie spends time in police custody. Adrien doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019s released without charges, or if she works out a deal instead of facing jail time, but she walks out of the station of her own accord, holding a hand up to shield her face from the cameras. And then, two weeks after Gabriel Agreste is unmasked as Hawkmoth, Nathalie takes over Gabriel fashion.\nThere\u2019s talk of renaming the brand, and remodelling the company entirely, so to completely detach themselves from Gabriel Agreste\u2019s blackened name.\nAdrien hasn\u2019t spoken to Nathalie. He has questions: did she know that Father was Hawkmoth? Did she help him? Did she know, like Father did, that he was Chat Noir?\nBut the thought of seeing Nathalie leaves Adrien feeling hollow. He wasn\u2019t important to her. And she was only important to him, because, during the years spent trapped inside that cavernous house, he clung to every spare glance, every familiar face, every moment he wasn\u2019t alone, or left making small talk with strangers.\nUnlike his coworker, the Gorilla seeks Adrien out. Sabine tries to stop him, forming a tiny, human blockade in the doorway to the apartment, but Adrien squeezes past her, and into the bakery proper.\nThe Gorilla never talked much. He never needed to. But now, dwarfing the family bakery, his hands held stiffly by his side, the Gorilla opens his mouth, and says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cFor what?\u201d A thought comes to him like an icepick through his stomach. \u201cDid you know?\u201d\nThe Gorilla shakes his head, no. \u201cNot that he was Hawkmoth. But I knew what sort of man he was.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHe was an unkind man,\u201d the Gorilla says. \u201cTo you, especially.\u201d\nAdrien stares at his shoes. Distantly, he\u2019s aware of Sabine in the doorway. This is her store; they shouldn\u2019t be doing this here. Adrien, especially, shouldn\u2019t be doing this here. It would bring the wrong kind of attention to the bakery.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was a terrorist,\u201d the Gorilla goes on, \u201cbut I knew how he treated you. And I knew you were Chat Noir.\u201d\nAdrien\u2019s eyes fly up to look at the Gorilla. \u201cYou knew? How?\u201d\n\u201cIt was my job to watch you. You were decent at slipping away, but not that decent.\u201d\n\u201cYou let me get away?\u201d\nThe Gorilla nods. \u201cThere were a few times, towards the end, when I wondered if I shouldn\u2019t just let you go running into a fight.\u201d\nAdrien stares at him blankly. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a kid. A kid shouldn\u2019t be in danger,\u201d the Gorilla says, as though it\u2019s obvious, as though it\u2019s that easy. As though Father wasn\u2019t the one that created the danger.\nAs if Father wasn\u2019t the danger.\nThe Gorilla leaves the bakery with a box full of pastries (that he asked Adrien to pick out). And that evening, Adrien types up a reference letter\u2014touching on the protection he received for years, and the way he, as a superhero, admired the Gorilla\u2019s devotion towards guarding people\u2014and sends it via email. A week later, the Gorilla accepts a position as head security to one of Europe\u2019s leading politicians.\n(And Adrien learns that his name is Victor. Adrien still prefers \u2018the Gorilla.\u2019)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe lawyer hands over a white envelop. Adrien Agreste, it says on the front in Father\u2019s handwriting.\n\u201cDoes he want to see me?\u201d\nThe lawyer stands, and smoothes out his suit jacket. \u201cHe asked me to deliver that to you. That\u2019s all.\u201d\nAdrien doesn\u2019t know if he wants to see Father. The idea of standing in front of him or talking to him twists his stomach up, but he has so many questions. There is still so much left unsaid. Things Adrien doesn\u2019t understand.\n\u201cBut all this work he put into handing all the family assets over to me, after everything, doesn\u2019t he want to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI have to go now.\u201d The lawyer nods coolly, and lets himself out. Adrien can hear him thanking Tom and Sabine before leaving.\nAdrien sits on the couch, staring at the envelop, until Plagg wriggles out of his shirt pocket. \u201cWell, that felt familiar.\u201d\nAdrien crumples up the letter. He could throw it out, he realises. There\u2019s no one here that will make him open it. He doubts anyone will even blame him if he never wants to read anything Father sends him.\nBut that idea leaves him feeling cold; he didn\u2019t want Father to fall out of his life. He didn\u2019t want any of this to happen. He didn\u2019t want to lose the last part of his family.\nTom and Sabine come in, gently asking how the meeting went. Adrien pulls on a polite smile, and excuses himself to Marinette\u2019s room. She watches him from her desk.\n\u201cI need some air,\u201d he says, and climbs up onto the balcony. Marinette, thankfully, understands his need for space.\nHe looks over the street. He wants to transform, and run through the city, but he doesn\u2019t want to be Chat Noir right now. The thought of being Chat Noir is heavy, in a way it\u2019s never been before.\nAdrien sits down against the rails. Plagg curls up in his hair, his tail falling over his forehead. Adrien opens the envelop, pulls out the letter, and begins to read.\n\nAdrien,\n\n\nI have ensured that the lawyers will take care of the Agreste accounts properly, so that you may have the funds to live independently. I know there may be terrorism charges stacked against me\u2014I do not want the Agreste fortune seized if this is the case. It should also be simple to get yourself emancipated. I imagine that, by the time you receive this letter, you will already be in the process of doing so.\n\n\nMy name is tarnished, but I have no doubts that yours is as powerful as ever. Perhaps more powerful, now, after your little revelation. If you associate with the right people and maintain your influence, your modelling career will flourish. It will take you through to adulthood and beyond. I assume I do not need to tell you not to revive the Gabriel name. You must learn to recognise when certain associates become more of a drain than an advantage, and when this time comes, you must drop them so they do not drag you down with them. My name is not just a drain; it is a black hole.\n\n\nI would advise you to also drop that foolish girl, but you have made it clear that she means more to you than anything else, including your own family. She is powerful, at least. You have good instincts to jump ship when you did, so that you could avoid scorn and maintain the public\u2019s trust, even if it was at the cost of your mother\u2019s life.\n\n\nDo me one favour, Adrien. Even if you threw away your family, do not dispose of your mother\u2019s photographs and paintings. They are all that is left of her, now. Even if you do not care for her visage anymore, place them in an art museum or move them to a storage container. Do not destroy her again.\n\nI do not even know if this letter will reach you. And if it does, then I do not know if you will even read it. You do not listen to your father, as of late. I should have listened when they told me that children grow up faster than I could ever imagine.\n\nI do not ask that you visit, but maybe one day, you will see me again. Not now, however. I cannot imagine we will have much to say to one another anytime soon.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nGabriel Agreste\n\nAdrien puts down the letter. He stares at the potted planets across from him, unseeing. He feels\u2014he doesn\u2019t know how he feels.\nTerrible, he realises after a long moment of staring at the sun-drenched plants. He feels terrible.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdrien\u2019s emancipation hearing is a quick, private affair.\nThe judge interviews Adrien and several people closest to him. His friends, a few teachers, and Nathalie. The interviews take place the week before the court date, and Adrien is only present for his own.\nThe hearing itself lasts half an hour. Adrien agrees to therapy sessions and annual meetings with a social worker, and then\u2014with the reassurance that Adrien has the means to support himself financially, and the maturity and support system to do so emotionally\u2014Adrien is emancipated.\nIt feels\u2014\nIt feels like freedom. It feels like abandonment. It feels like a long-forgotten dream that was always hovering on Adrien\u2019s horizon, the thing he wanted but never understood.\nHe understands it now. It\u2019s a beautiful, terrible thing. Adrien can hardly breathe around the painful, too-big feeling in his chest.\nHe wants to cry, but his cheeks are dry. He goes into the hallway and nods, too dazed for words, and lets his friends sweep him up into hugs. He smiles as Nino swoops in three more times to hug him, but it doesn\u2019t feel real. His heart, thumping against his ribs, is hard to ignore.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGabriel Agreste\u2019s trial lasts almost two weeks.\nOn the witness stand is a gallery of familiar faces. Akuma victims, including a slew of Adrien\u2019s classmates. Alya, Nino, and Marinette. Gabriel models and designers. The Gorilla. Nathalie. Ladybug.\nAdrien is called up more than once to speak as Chat Noir, Gabriel\u2019s direct opponent, and Adrien Agreste, Gabriel\u2019s son.\nWhen the prosecution starts throwing around the word victim in reference to Adrien, he has to stuff his hands under his thighs to keep himself from bolting out of the courtroom. When the prosecution depicts Father as an abusive monster, he chews on the inside of his mouth until he tastes blood.\nAdrien was unhappy at home. He felt unsafe during those last few weeks, but, until he had woken up and seen Father silhouetted in his bedroom doorway, that had only been paranoia. Father was controlling and cold, but he wasn\u2019t hateful. Adrien was isolated. He was often hungry. And some weeks ago, when he had snuck out to visit Nino\u2019s, sitting thigh-to-thigh on his bed while Adrien cried in that silent, crumbling way of his, he hadn\u2019t argued when Nino put a hand on Adrien\u2019s shoulder and said, tentatively, That\u2019s abuse.\nBut this is different. While every media outlet reports that Gabriel Agreste was a violent, self-centred psychopath, Adrien remembers being small and Father touching his hair after he\u2019d aced another test; Father holding his scribbled drawings like they were something precious, and framing them around his office; Father, dressed as Hawkmoth, his eyes wild behind the mask, lashing his sword against Adrien\u2019s baton; Father, collapsed against Mum, crying into her ashy hair.\nFather is silent and emotionless in the courtroom. His shoulders are straight, and his hair is brushed. His bloodshot eyes and the chalky pallor of his face are the only indications that he\u2019s hurting.\nWhen Adrien takes to the witness stand, he steals quick glances at Father.\nFather fixes his eyes on the wall. He never once, in the entire eight days the trail runs, looks at Adrien.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdrien isn\u2019t alone for the first month after Father\u2019s arrest.\nHe's used to being around people most hours of the day, but living with other people is entirely new. It\u2019s the little things that leave him feeling punched out and breathless: waking up and seeing Marinette, or Nino, or Alya, or Chloe across the room from him, rather than open, empty space; stumbling down to breakfast and sitting down with people who smile and ask him how he slept; being welcomed home from school, knowing there is no where else he needs to be; helping Nino wash and dry dishes, getting suds down his designer jeans, laughing as Nino makes a bubble-beard out of dish soap; standing in Marinette\u2019s cramped kitchen and quietly helping Tom chop vegetables, listening to his gentle voice as he teaches Adrien the recipe.\nIt\u2019s a lot to get used.\nAdrien can eat what he wants now. Wear what he wants. Go where he wants. There are no more schedules dictating his life.\nHe misses it, sometimes. For all the years he suffocated under a colour-coded schedule, he misses the surety of knowing where he was supposed to be. When he was lost, he would go to Nathalie, and she would list off his timetable for the day, narrowed down to the minute.\nAdrien is lost most days, but now, there\u2019s no Nathalie to tell him where to go. Sometimes, the freedom is a relief. Sometimes, it makes it hard to breathe.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdrien puts weight on.\nChloe catches him looking in the mirror, shirt hiked up around his throat, prodding his stomach. He\u2019s been stick-thin for so long; every small change in his weight is immediately noticeable.\nShe comes up behind him, startling him. He drops his shirt. She pulls it back up, pokes him in the side, as though testing how\u00a0easy it is to feel his ribs\u2014or how easy it isn\u2019t, compared to months earlier, when his ribs stuck out.\nChloe nods. \u201cBetter.\u201d\nAdrien rubs at his side. \u201cBetter?\u201d\n\u201cBetter. I guess that bakery isn\u2019t completely terrible.\u201d\n\u201cYou like their strawberry eclairs,\u201d Adrien says. She likes more than their strawberry eclairs. She likes most of the store. She has a sweet tooth to rival his; it\u2019s one of the newfound things they\u2019ve bonded over.\n\u201cI like how close it is to the school,\u201d Chloe says, flipping her ponytail over her shoulder. \u201cNow, come on. I want to feed you more pasta.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe wears whatever he wants.\nHe bounces from house to house\u2014always ending back at that small apartment that smells like baked bread, where the Dupain-Chengs welcome him with matching smiles\u2014so his wardrobe is constantly shifting. He likes borrowing Nino\u2019s clothes; he has tracksuit pants and hoodies worn into an unbeatable softness.\nChloe likes to play dress up. Adrien slept at her house, something he hadn\u2019t done since they were very small, and the next time he went up to the penthouse at the Grand Hotel, she had suddenly acquired a dozen different things in his size. (Tucked neatly next to her growing collection of Chat Noir merchandise.)\nMarinette likes to play dress up even more than Chloe, but with her, it\u2019s different. She likes when he wears her things. The things she made.\nAdrien likes it, too. He knows the importance of wearing clothes made by someone you love.\nHis outfits become a mash of designer clothes and faded hoodies, homemade clothes and expensive things foisted onto him by Chloe. He wears borrowed clothing, and feminine clothes, and clothes with holes in them, because he can.\nHe stops wearing product in his hair. Father had disapproved of his naturally messy hair. But now\u2014without the bathroom cabinets full of expensive hair product, and with his friend\u2019s hands always tussling it, and the kwamis' constantly settling there and napping in his hair\u2014Adrien\u2019s hair is thicker and more untamed than ever. He looks like Chat Noir during the day. It\u2019s freeing; it\u2019s like Adrien has stolen some of the freedom he had felt when he was the mysterious, masked Chat Noir and taken it into his personal life.\n(One day, maybe soon, Adrien will branch out into his own style. There are things he\u2019s attracted to, like the sketch in Marinette\u2019s notebook of a leather jacket with green paw prints sewn down the back, and blanket-like scarves, and graphic t-shirts with puns scrawled on the front.\nBut for now, he\u2019s exploring. For now, anything his friends give him, anything Marinette has made, is more than enough.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBeing in public is strange. Before, he would occasionally be recognised as Adrien Agreste, son of a famous fashion mogul, but it\u2019s different, now. A superhero is more famous than a teenage model.\nThe tourists are the worst. When they see Adrien\u2014boring, everyday Adrien in the pastel green sweatshirt Marinette made him, stopping to buy coffee before school\u2014they don\u2019t see a sixteen year old. They see a superhero.\nHis friends come in handy. Nino likes to stand in front of him, and pull ugly faces at whoever has their phone pointed at him without his permission. Alya calls people out for invading his privacy, comfortable with making a scene. Or, alternatively, she pulls out her phone, and films them right back.\nAnd through it all is Marinette.\nEven though her own identity could be compromised with how much time she spends with him, Marinette is always there, ready to tell people off. She\u2019s there to gently tug Adrien away from busy public streets. She\u2019s there when it gets too crowded, patting his hair when he hides his face in her neck. She\u2019s there with beanies, and scarves, and hoodies that hide his gold-blond hair. She looked into fashionable face masks, just for him.\nAdrien loves her so much that he might die of it, too many emotions stuffed into his chest, too much of that easy, warm love for one human body.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdrien buys an apartment, even though everyone tells him he doesn\u2019t have to. Chloe spends weeks shoving photos of the Grand Hotel in his face, and telling him that he can stay there indefinitely, free of charge. Nino relays the many messages from his family, worried about Adrien living on his own. Alya just cackles, and vows to be over every other day to enjoy the quiet and mooch on his wifi.\nWhen he moves in, Sabine and Tom pile him with food. Nino comes over with potato bake casseroles from his mother, apologetic as he hands them over, and then runs into the living room to check out the game console Marinette helped set up the night before.\nAdrien has his grocery delivered regularly so he doesn\u2019t forget, or have to go out to get them. He googles recipes, and prints them out, and pins them to his fridge.\nHe learns that he\u2019s a bad cook. It takes a while before his dishes shift from blackened and inedible, to passable.\nIt\u2019s not easy. His newfound freedom scares him, sometimes. So do the freedoms that have been taken from him\u2014the way he\u00a0struggles to go out in public without being recognised; the new rumours that have started up at school; the weird, hovering way people look at him, sometimes.\nBut he\u2019s okay, and that scares him, too. He wishes Father wasn\u2019t Hawkmoth, that it never happened, that it didn\u2019t still leave him waking in the dead of the night, crying into Plagg\u2019s fur\u2014but he\u2019s okay. Adrien is okay.\nThe revelation brought him closer to his friends. It brought him Marinette. It brought him a life that\u2019s not ruled by a schedule. It gave him the ability to be known for something more than his modelling, or Father\u2019s fashion. He\u2019s known for his efforts as Chat Noir, his bravery, not just for his pretty face.\nSomedays, it feels like his life should have stopped the moment he stumbled into that hidden, shadowy room, and found the mass of bone-white butterflies. He feels like a bad person for letting time run past that moment. Somedays, he feels bad for living past it.\nHe feels bad for living.\nBut time, too, will eat up this feeling, until the vivid ache inside him feels less like a fresh bullet wound, and more like an old, puckered scar.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nParis is a thousand pale gold lights in the nighttime. Marinette watches the view quietly, waiting for him.\nAdrien lands on the Eiffel Tower, baton clinking against the railings. \u201cThanks for coming, Marinette.\u201d\n\u201cNightmares?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nShe laces their fingers together. They do it so often that this, the way their fingers slot together, the way their palms rub together, feels like muscle-memory.\n\u201cMe, too,\u201d Marinette says. \u201cBut we\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d His hand tightens around hers for a moment. She squeezes back.\n\u201cWe will,\u201d she says again, more firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, Adrien.\u201d\nAdrien pulls her up onto the railings. They stand there, hundreds of metres above the asphalt. The wind ghosts through their hair. Adrien dislodges the lump in his throat, pushes past the guilt and fear\u2014always inside him but retreating day by day, like a jar of mud settling over time, dirt and sediment sinking to the bottom, leaving the water less murky with every passing moment\u2014and says,\u201cI think I\u2019m already halfway there.\u201d"
