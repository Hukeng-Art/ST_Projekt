Let\u2019s just pretend Gusu is a 30-50 minute ride away from Shanghai, where WWX/WQ/WN works. Of course none of the major MDZS cities are located in Beijing, the only place I have actual experience living in. So why do half of the characters have a Beijing accent in the donghua?? WHAT IS THE TRUTH?</p>\n<p>Some thoughts re: Sizhui\u2019s adoption. WQ and WN weren\u2019t in a good place (socially, economically) to adopt Wen Yuan at the time, but they fully believed the Lans would return their foster child without a problem. So of course Sizhui bursted out crying \u201cPAPA!! I don\u2019t wanna go!\u201d all snot nosed while clinging onto LWJ\u2019s. WQ\u2019s promotion was pretty recent, so they weren\u2019t always well off, especially after Wen Ruohan bankrupted most of the extended family.</p>\n<p>NEXT CHAPTER WILL BE PRESENTED BY LAN JINGYI, and I promise it\u2019ll be more fun!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Mala = \u9ebb\u8fa3 = Numbing and spicy, a popular cooking method in Sichuan.

In the novel, Jin Ling calls JGY \"\u5c0f\u53d4\u53d4/xiao shushu.\" Here, the title has been given to Mo Xuanyu. I had some sort of dialogue in mind for Jin Ling to explain what his shushus (paternal uncles) are doing now, but it never made it into the story. TLDR; JZX eventually hired a handful of his half brothers to work under him, partly for them to prove their worth and partly because his wife convinced him to. Why? Probably because I saw too many happy fanart of JZX/JGY/MXY as siblings</p>\n<p>Looking back, I question my own transitions from english to pinyin to hanyu, especially in the WeChat section...

    "text": "Jin Ling knows he\u2019s in deep trouble even before reporting to Headmaster Lan\u2019s office, but the words \u201cyour uncle will be here soon\u201d still strike the fear of God in him. His only consolation is that Jingyi and Sizhui\u2019s guardians are also in the office, Jingyi\u2019s mom already lecturing her sheepish-looking son. Lan-ayi only stops when Sizhui\u2019s father, a quiet and tall man in white, clears his throat, causing her to engage him in one-sided smalltalk.\nThis is a disaster. Jin Ling had spent such a nice break at home for Mid-Autumn Festival, and Fairy\u2019s presence had soothed his homesickness after returning to boarding school in Gusu. He knows pets aren\u2019t allowed, but who is going to report Jin Ling when his father pays good money for a private suite in the dorms? Then there was the incident with Jingyi, a box of mooncakes, and a door left ajar. Even whistling hadn\u2019t done the trick. Long story short, he spent an hour chasing Fairy down the halls with Sizhui and Jingyi before finding his dog nosing up to a very angry Headmaster Lan.\n\u201c-And I told my Jingyi he needs to stop being such a bad influence on Sizhui,\u201d Jingyi\u2019s mother continues. \u201cSizhui is such a well-mannered and accomplished child. I\u2019d be so happy if any of my children were like him.\u201d Behind her, Jingyi makes an exasperated face, like he\u2019s heard this too many times. Jin Ling supposes that\u2019s one thing they have in common.\n\u201cNot at all. Sizhui is lucky to have a friend like him,\u201d Sizhui\u2019s father replies. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s spoken at all, and Jin Ling is not surprised at the quiet note of authority in his voice. \nHeadmaster Lan huffs. \u201cSee, I always said you were too soft on Sizhui. Now look where we are! Running? Shouting? Boarding illegal pets in my school? Preposterous. Now we have to deal with the Jin family again, and his guardian has the audacity to be late! Why must history always repeat itself?\u201d \nSizhui and Jingyi will probably be fine, both being a part of the Lan family that funds and runs the school. Jin Ling is the one facing possible expulsion and a shameful return to Lanling, to the quiet disappointment of his mother and the obvious disapproval of his extended family. His time at Cloud Recesses Academy is supposed to be a chance to prove himself, yet Jin Ling struggles with newfound rules and socialization with students his age. Even worse is the fact that Jin Ling has no clue who is coming, aside from the small hint that it would be an uncle on his mother\u2019s side. At least his mother isn\u2019t making the trip. Jin Ling would rather step into Shanghai traffic than make her travel so far just to take him home.\nAs if on cue, familiar voices carry in from the hallway. \n\u201cI told you to not get him that dog! It\u2019s the year of the pig now! Why couldn\u2019t you just send Ling-er off with some ribs instead?\u201d\n\u201cOh, shut up already! As if you don\u2019t spoil him too! And you know he choked on those ribs before!\u201d\nOh god, Jin Ling thinks. He feels his face burning as the door bursts open to reveal both of his jiujius arguing their way into the room. Jiang Cheng is polite enough to greet Handmaster Lan, but Wei Wuxian just flies to Jin Ling\u2019s side and pulls him into a half-hug. \n\u201cLing-bao! Don\u2019t look so unhappy to see me!\u201d Wei Wuxian laughs, obviously on his life mission to embarrass Jin Ling with endless pet names. \n\u201cHe\u2019s always unhappy to see you,\u201d Jiang Cheng mutters. He gives cold nods of acknowledgement to everyone in the room.\nWei Wuxian just laughs, his voice reverberating. \u201cTell him you like ribs, Ling-er! And I\u2019ll definitely help if you start choking again.\u201d\n\u201cThat happened when I was five!\u201d Jin Ling hisses in embarrassment and tries to extract himself from his uncle\u2019s grip. \n\u201cYeah, but you\u2019ll always be five in my-\u201d\n\u201cENOUGH!\u201d Headmaster Lan says, and Wei Wuxian blinks as if he\u2019s noticing everyone else for the first time. \u201cWei Wuxian! You\u2019re disrespectable as always! You\u2019ve learned nothing since I last saw you, and now your nephew is every bit of a troublemaker!\u201d\nWei Wuxian just grins. \u201cYou look as distinguished as always, Headmaster Lan! I see your beard grew!\u201d \nNext to him, Jiang Cheng very obviously rolls his eyes. \n\u201cJust looking at you is making me age rapidly!\u201d\n\u201cAnd Ling-zi is a good kid! Don\u2019t be so harsh on him!\u201d\nIf possible, Headermaster Lan\u2019s face grows even redder in anger. \u201cDo good kids break half a dozen rules and get one of my best students in trouble?!\u201d He points at Sizhui, causing Jin Ling\u2019s gaze to travel to the quiet boy and his equally wordless father.\nWei Wuxian does the same, and his grip on Jin Ling\u2019s shoulder tightens noticeably. \u201cLan Zhan?\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Sizhui\u2019s father says, voice unreadable. This surprises Jin Ling, for he can\u2019t even remember the last time his parents called his uncle by his real name. Sizhui seems to share the sentiment, with the way he peers up at his father. \n\u201cNo greeting for me, huh?\u201d Wei Wuxian smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re the same as always. It\u2019s nice to see you again.\u201d\nJingyi\u2019s mother decides it\u2019s her turn to speak again. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that my son bothered young master Jin. He\u2019s always been a troublemaker, you see. I told him to be on his best behavior at Cloud Recesses, but he\u2019s just not one for following the rules. I\u2019m sorry he-\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Jingyi\u2019s fault!\u201d Jin Ling blurts out, then closes his mouth when all the adults turn to him. Even Sizhui\u2019s eyebrows are lifted in surprise. Jin Ling sets his gaze on his lap, tears of frustration already welling in his eyes. He hates this childish side of him, but he also hates making others atone for his mistakes. It makes him feel even more helpless, like Jin Ling can never be accountable for himself. When Wei Wuxian sets a comforting hand on his shoulder, Jin Ling continues. \u201cI\u2019m the one who brought Fairy in. Lan Jingyi and Lan Sizhui were just trying to help me. It\u2019s not their fault. If you\u2019re going to punish someone, then punish me! Expel me instead!\u201d \nAfter a moment, Headmaster Lan coughs. \u201cNo one is getting expelled. Wipe your tears. It\u2019s unbecoming.\u201d\nWei Wuxian slips a black and red handkerchief into Jin Ling\u2019s hands. Even Jiang Cheng looks somewhat sympathetic and sets a hand on Jin Ling\u2019s head. \n\u201cLan Sizhui, Lan Jingyi, and Jin Ling: all three of you will serve detention for a week. Administrator Chen will oversee the details.\u201d Headmaster Lan declares, then sighs. \u201cAnd the dog must go. Bring it in.\u201d\nJin Ling cheers up immediately when the secretary opens the door to let Fairy in. As always, Fairy is excited to see everyone and rushes over to Jin Ling, causing Wei Wuxian to yelp and skitter across the room, to the farthest corner away from Fairy. He looks almost comical, hiding behind Sizhui\u2019s father.\n\u201cGet that thing out of here!\u201d Wei Wuxian hisses as he crouches behind Sizhui\u2019s father. He tugs desperately on Sizhui\u2019s father\u2019s arm. \u201cJiang Cheng! Get rid of it!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an embarrassment,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, but clips a leash to Fairy\u2019s collar regardless. Nonplussed, Fairy goes to sniff Jiang Cheng\u2019s feet. \nWhile Sizhui\u2019s father doesn\u2019t move away from Wei Wuxian, Jingyi\u2019s mother seems to be rapidly losing respect for him. It\u2019s normal for people to feel a disconnect between Dr. Wei Wuxian, nationally recognized pediatrics trauma surgeon, and the foolish way he carries himself. Jin Ling had grown up buried in sand by his jokester uncle on family vacations only to have him rush out in the middle of dinner to attend to emergencies at the hospital. Then there was Jiang Cheng, who was harsh with words but soft with his affection for Jin Ling. It\u2019s no wonder that Jin Ling\u2019s mother put them down as emergency contacts on his school file, especially after Jiang Cheng began overseeing the Suzhou branch of Grandpa Jiang's company and Wei Wuxian got transferred to the biggest hospital in Shanghai. \n\u201cI have a headache,\u201d Headmaster Lan adds. \u201cAll of you are dismissed for the day. And Wei Wuxian, I don\u2019t want to see you or your nephew in my office again.\u201d\nWei Wuxian nods fervently, still hiding behind Sizhui\u2019s father. He\u2019s the first out of the door after the dismissal, and he makes wild-armed gestures at Jiang Cheng to keep Fairy away from him while everyone empties into the hallway. When Wei Wuxian gets pulled into a conversation with Jingyi\u2019s mom, Sizhui moves over to Jin Ling.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know your uncle was Dr. Wei,\u201d Sizhui says softly, watching Wei Wuxian charm Jingyi\u2019s mom. \n\u201cMore importantly.\u201d Jingyi lowers his voice. \u201cAre your uncles always like this?\u201d\nJin Ling doesn't know how to explain that Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian\u2019s banter doesn\u2019t even scratch the surface of Jin Ling\u2019s convoluted family dynamics, especially with his father\u2019s large extended family. He\u2019ll never admit it, but Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian are probably his favorites. Now, Jin Ling watches Wei Wuxian chat with Sizhui\u2019s father with the same overt familiarity he does with the children in the pediatrics ward. He knows that his parents, and probably the parents of everyone here, once attended Cloud Recesses. Yet his family rarely speaks of their time at school. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d Jin Ling says at last. \n\u201cAre your uncles friends with Han Guang-Jun?\u201d Jingyi asks. All three of them look as Wei Wuxian throws an arm around Sizhui\u2019s father\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cIf you can even call them that,\u201d Jiang Cheng tsks, having supernatural hearing as always. He dumps Fairy into Jin Ling\u2019s arms and watches as Fairy leans up to lick Jin Ling\u2019s nose. \u201cOi, Wei Wuxian! Stop blabbering and get over here! We\u2019re leaving!\u201d\nJin Ling\u2019s heart falls. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving already?\u201d\nJiang Cheng looks at him for a moment, then pats Jin Ling\u2019s arm. \u201cDon\u2019t be so soft. You can still come see me on the weekend. The headmaster went easy on you. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m not gonna punish you for sneaking Fairy in. You said the dog was gonna stay in Lanling! Did you lie to your parents too?\u201d\n\u201cPunish-?\u201d Jin Ling begins.\n\u201cYour punishment is to eat dinner with us!\u201d Wei Wuxian cheers. He puts both hands on Jin Ling\u2019s shoulder and gyrates Jin Ling in his spot. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any more classes for the day, right? Just skip them if you do!\u201d\n\u201cJie is not paying for this school just so you can set a bad example for A-Ling!\u201d Jiang Cheng huffs, but leads them towards the direction of the building exit regardless. For a moment, Jin Ling had forgotten that they both attended Cloud Recesses too. \nWei Wuxian just cackles. \u201cBad example? I\u2019m his favorite uncle!\u201d\n\u201cOi!\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m his favorite dajiu-\u201d\nWhile his uncles argue, Jin Ling turns around. He doesn\u2019t quite try, but still manages to catch Jingyi\u2019s eye as Jingyi gives him a hasty wave goodbye. Sizhui stands next to him, a soft smile on his face. Yet, Sizhui\u2019s father gaze is direct and unwavering, fixed very obviously on Wei Wuxian\u2019s retreating back. Weird, Jin Ling thinks. \n\u201cAnyways, we should go to the Sichuan hot pot place I discovered-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not eating anything that will burn my mouth off,\u201d Jiang Cheng cuts in. They\u2019re out of the building and heading to the east part of campus, towards the parking area. \u201cAnyways, Fairy can ride in my car. A-Ling, you go with this idiot so he doesn\u2019t get distracted, take you to McDonalds, and leave you in the bathroom again.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, that was one incident-\u201d\n\u201cSichuan hotpot is fine!\u201d Jin Ling croaks. They\u2019re still on still Cloud Recesses grounds and people are starting to pay attention to the noise. Jin Ling can\u2019t have any of his classmates hearing this. Jingyi would never stop bringing it up!\nLater, when they\u2019re stuck in traffic and Jin Ling has sent his parents an abridged version of today\u2019s events on WeChat, Jin Ling turns to his uncle. \u201cDoes Sizhui\u2019s father hate you?\u201d\n\u201cWho? Lan Zhan?\u201d Wei Wuxian taps his long fingers on the steering wheel. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in a decade. Who knew he even had a child?\u201d\nJin Ling rolls his eyes. \u201cSizhui is older than me, so you should\u2019ve known about him more than ten years ago. You suck at math!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re barely nine.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fourteen!!\u201d Jin Ling yells, then frowns when his reaction sends Wei Wuxian into a fit of laughter. \u201cAnd he couldn\u2019t stop glaring at you! His gaze is colder than Grandma\u2019s when she\u2019s out for blood!\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan\u2019s not a cold person. He just, I guess, doesn\u2019t like me? We\u2019re better off avoiding each other.\u201d Wei Wuxian replies easily, his eyes on the road. \u201cAnd don\u2019t bring your grandma up. I\u2019m scared of her!\u201d\nEveryone is scared of her, Jin Ling thinks but doesn\u2019t say. It\u2019s bad enough that she\u2019s the toughest on him for being the oldest. He\u2019s pretty sure his parents only narrowly avoided her scorn by being the only pair to bring her grandchildren. Jin Ling has heard her berate Jiang Cheng on more than one occasion for ruining his own matchmaking sessions, and Jin Ling doesn\u2019t even want to think about the kind of people Wei Wuxian would date, much less procreate with. Adults are so weird.\n\u201cAnyways, don\u2019t let my bad blood with Lan Zhan ruin your budding relationships! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re making friends!\u201d\nJin Ling can feel his face flushing, so he turns towards the window and stares out into traffic. The kids at home always made fun of him. First for his haughty nature, then for his lack of hobbies outside of archery, and then for being the prettiest out of four kids when three of them were girls. Jin Ling doesn\u2019t know how to interact with real people besides his younger sisters and caretakers. Jingyi has even taken to calling him Jin Daxiaojie, although his voice is starting to irritate Jin Ling less these days. \u201cWhatever. They\u2019re not my friends.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not your friends yet you still defended them? In front of old man Lan, no less? Wow, you\u2019re so chivalrous!\u201d\n\u201cStop making fun of me!\u201d\nMore laughter. \u201cI\u2019m not making fun of you! I love you! You\u2019re my favorite nephew!\u201d\n\u201cY-you! How can you say that so easily! You\u2019re so shameless!\u201d Outside, a red Tesla edges past them on the right only to get stuck at the next traffic light. Maybe they shouldn\u2019t have driven so far out of Gusu. There were perfectly fine, non-spicy food options near Caiyi. \u201cAnd I\u2019m your only nephew! How far is the place anyway?\u201d\n Wei Wuxian just hums. \u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d\nSure enough, they pull into a parking garage connected to a large mall. Jin Ling follows his uncle out of the car only to be led on a strange winding path behind the building, into a series of hutongs. They eventually arrive in front of a nondescript looking store framed by lanterns. Jiang Cheng is already waiting outside, looking irritated.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Fairy?\u201d Jin Ling asks immediately.\n\u201cRelax, your dog is fine. I left a crack open in the window for him. I don\u2019t see you worrying or apologizing to me for making me wait.\u201d \nWei Wuxian makes silly face. \u201cSorry! I got lost!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who recommended this place! Haven\u2019t you been here before?!\u201d\n\u201cI have bad memory!\u201d\nThankfully, Jiang Cheng\u2019s mood improves when they\u2019re seated inside. He orders a clear broth for their side of the table and ignores the liberal amount of spices Wei Wuxiang orders for his section of the hot pot. The food arrives quickly, and both of Jin Ling\u2019s uncles engage in a race to see who can put the most on Jin Ling\u2019s plate.\nThe food is good, probably the best he\u2019s had since coming to Gusu. Jin Ling is chewing on a piece of tofu when he remembers something else. \u201cHeadmaster Lan said something about dealing with my family again. What does he mean? Did Father get in trouble?\u201d\nA piece of mushroom slips through Wei Wuxian\u2019s chopsticks. He says \u201cEh,\u201d while Jiang Cheng snorts. \u201cYour Father is\u2026 A good person. We get along now. You know? Richie Ren Boys forever!\u201d \n\u201cOkay?\u201d Jin Ling squints. Although he\u2019s never seen Wei Wuxian display obvious affection towards his father, Jin Ling could never forget the year he was eight and spent Chunjie in Yunmeng. Wei Wuxian had challenged Jin Ling\u2019s father to a karaoke competition that ended with them drunkenly dueting to Richie Ren. Even worse was that Bingbing, Jin Ling\u2019s first sister, had gotten ahold of the matching tambourine and given him one. Jin Ling had gotten so excited that he consumed too much fried peanuts and soy milk, only to throw all the food up later. Grandma had been furious with everyone involved. \u201cSo what? Where is this going?\u201d\n\u201cDid your mother tell you that this guy here was kicked out of Cloud Recesses during our first year?\u201d Jiang Cheng portions more dipping sauce into Jin Ling\u2019s bowl. \nJin Ling\u2019s mother didn\u2019t tell him that, but he supposes the timelines match. He knows Wei Wuxian studied abroad in Canada for a few years before going to Beijing for medical school. \u201cWhat did you do to get expelled? Did you get in a fight with Sizhui\u2019s dad?\u201d\nThis makes Jiang Cheng laugh. \u201cNot that Lan kid\u2019s father! He got kicked out for punching your father!\u201d\n\u201cWHAT!?!?!\u201d\nThis is what Lan Sizhui knows:\nHe was born Wen Yuan, to distant members of the Wen family that once attempted and nearly succeeded in creating an exports monopoly in southern China. Sizhui remembers a little of his life before joining the Lan family, but his adoption has never been a topic of shame. He knows he\u2019s fortunate to survive the three-car collision that killed his birth parents, and even more so to be taken in by the Lan brothers.\nWhat Sizhui learns later is that he had hovered on the edge of death for so long that even his aging grandmother had made peace with it. Sizhui had no memories of the three months he spent in the hospital, so he\u2019d been surprised to hear his uncle recall Sizhui\u2019s past on the 5th anniversary of his parents\u2019 death, long after his grandmother had joined her children in the grave.\n\u201cYour lung collapsed, and you suffered from abdominal and intracranial hemorrhage,\u201d Lan Xichen had explained calmly. \u201cThe outlook was quite grim. The surgeon operated on you for six hours. Then you had multiple follow-up surgeries. The hospital director wanted to transfer you out to make bed space for patients with more hopeful prognosis, but your father and the pediatric surgeon petitioned your case.\u201d \nHis uncle had smiled then, fondness obvious on his face. \u201cYou survived and blossomed into such a compassionate child. You have Wangji and Dr. Wei Wuxian to thank for that.\u201d\nSizhui has, of course, done his best to become a child worthy of Lan Wangji. His father is modest with his affections, but kind in every way that matters. His peers and teachers call him a prodigy, a model student, but Sizhui knows he\u2019d be nothing without persistent hard work and an ever-present yearning for his father\u2019s approval. He\u2019d also researched Dr. Wei throughout the years, wondering what happened to his faceless savior. Yet his father never spoke of Dr. Wei, and eventually Sizhui found more value in focusing on the present than questioning the past.\nSeeing Wei Wuxian in the flesh is unprompted, unexpected, and unlike anything Sizhui could have imagined. There\u2019s something unsettlingly refreshing about Wei Wuxian, who is unconventionally charming and has eyes that makes Sizhui want him to smile in his direction. \nSizhui\u2019s father seems to share this sentiment. He\u2019s unnaturally quiet through the entire meeting and makes no effort to step away from Wei Wuxian, even after Jin Ling\u2019s uncle becomes unnecessarily touchy. Sizhui has never seen his father react positively, or even neutrally, to unwarranted contact. The sight of Wei Wuxian throwing an arm around his father sends a million questions through Sizhui\u2019s mind. \n\u201cFather?\u201d Sizhui asks after Jin Ling leaves with his uncles, and Jingyi wanders off with his mother. \u201cWas that the Dr. Wei Uncle told me about?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji says tightly, as if he\u2019s seen a ghost. \nSizhui treads carefully. \u201cAre you friends?\u201d\n\u201cOld acquaintances, at most. Come, let\u2019s get dinner.\u201d \nLan Wangji turns, and Sizhui knows that\u2019s the end of this conversation. He has so many questions, but past experience dictates his father will probably answer none of them. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSizhui is still thinking about this weird encounter when Administrator Chen assigns them to clean the rabbit pens a few days later. Sizhui and Jingyi wait at the student gardens after class for Jin Ling to arrive, Jingyi busy scrolling through his phone. Jin Ling appears ten minutes later, huffing and puffing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re late!\u201d Jingyi points out while Sizhui is unlocking the gate.\nJin Ling doesn\u2019t quite pout, but his face does something equally endearing. \u201cI had to tell the archery club that I can\u2019t make it to practice this week.\u201d\n\u201cMust be hard being the star of the archery team.\u201d Jingyi whistles. It\u2019s a compliment coming from him, but it sends Jin Ling into an indignant yelp. \nSizhui pushes the gate open then and leads them into the student garden. This seems to be Jin Ling\u2019s first time here, because his mouth opens slightly as his eyes land on the fountain, the seasonal crops maintained by the horticulture club, and the rabbit pens at the west end of the garden. \u201cWelcome to detention\u201d\n\u201cWe got off easy,\u201d Jingyi says as they follow Sizhui towards the custom built rabbit pens. \u201cThis is barely a punishment. Sizhui already cleans and maintains this area regularly anyway.\u201d When Jin Ling\u2019s mouth drops open, Jingyi grins. \u201cOh, stop staring and help me set up. We gotta make a play area so they stay away from the plants.\u201d\nJin Ling diverts his eyes from the rabbits when Jingyi hands him a stack of gates to interlock. \u201cWho-why are there so many rabbits? I thought pets weren\u2019t allowed!\u201d\n\u201cPets are not allowed in the dorms,\u201d Sizhui explains as he works on creating a series of pet gates. \u201cBut these rabbits are maintained and cared for by students. They\u2019ve also been here longer than me. Some of the clubs take turns cleaning and feeding them, but when there\u2019s a lapse in schedule, I like to come in and help.\u201d\nAs always, Jingyi manages to nip his finger on one of the metal sections. He grins when Sizhui hands him a bandaid. \u201cRumor has it that these rabbits once belonged to Han Guang-Jun and Ze Wu-Jun! They just kept breeding and Headmaster Lan didn\u2019t have the heart to get rid of them. Now he uses them to teach us about responsibility and all that. Sizhui- what is this?\u201d Jingyi sticks his finger out to show them the cartoon sheep printed on his bandaid.\n\u201cOne of the girls in my class gave me a box of these. I just kept them.\u201d Sizhui pays no attention to Jingyi\u2019s comment of you\u2019re so popular and gets back to work.\n\u201cIs this big enough?\u201d Jin Ling asks once they\u2019ve set up a free roaming area that covers half of the garden. \nIt\u2019s obvious Jin Ling got a bit overzealous. The sides are hardly straight and Sizhui has never seen such a weirdly shaped pet fence before. Still, a preliminary tug at the gate shows it\u2019s secure enough. \u201cThis is fine. Would you like to hold the rabbits?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sure whatever,\u201d Jin Ling mumbles, but his eyes light up when Sizhui unlocks the pen and a few rabbits hop over towards Sizhui\u2019s hand. Jin Ling opens his mouth wordlessly when Sizhui picks up a nearby grey rabbit and sets him in Jin Ling\u2019s arms. \u201cWhat-how do I hold this thing?\u201d\nJingyi tsks and moves over to help. \u201cHere, put your right arm underneath the butt. You want all four feet to be pressed against your body so they don\u2019t get scared. Don\u2019t stress him out!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re stressing me out!\u201d Jin Ling hisses, but lowers his voice when the grey rabbit stirs in his arms. He stares down, fondness obvious on his face while Jingyi and Sizhui each pick up their own. \nSizhui has already taken today\u2019s food out of the storage area. This week\u2019s supply is a mix of artichoke leaves, green beans, and a mix of spring greens.\n\u201cNo carrots?\u201d Jin Ling asks, peering over Sizhui\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAnd where did all this come from anyway?\u201d\n\u201cCarrots are high in sugar. They shouldn\u2019t be a main source of food,\u201d Jingyi says knowingly as if imitating Sizhui. He scratches his rabbit lightly on the cheek with one finger. \u201cAnd the cooking club sets aside their extras every week. They say the leaves will go to waste anyway, but look at how nicely some of these pieces are cut! The president definitely has a crush on Sizhui!\u201d\nThe only response they get is a weird look from Jin Ling, who picks up a thin piece of artichoke leaf and feeds it to his rabbit. \n\u201cThese are just snacks. Feel free to feed some to them while they free roam. We still need to change out the hay and water.\u201d When Jin Ling doesn\u2019t reply, too engrossed with his new friend, Sizhui laughs and moves another rabbit out of the pen. After most of them are settled in the free roam area, Sizhui sets today\u2019s snacks on a small stool. \nCleaning out the bedding and litter box feels therapeutic. It's been a relaxing pastime for Sizhui, ever since his father first showed him how to care for rabbits. There was always something undeniably fond about the way his father handled them, and Sizhui slowly begun to see the same care his father put into everything he touched. \n\u201cLet me help!\u201d Jingyi scoots over after Sizhui has readjusted the hay in the feeder. \u201cYou go play with them!\u201d\nIt\u2019s still mid-autumn, and the temperature is perfect for an afternoon spent in leisure. Sizhui misses times like this, when he could go to the rooftop gardens of his family\u2019s complex and play guqin without bothering anyone. On those days, he\u2019d always find a distant relative there drinking tea and praising his playing. Sometimes the elderly relatives in the building voiced their concerns about Sizhui not having a mother. Yet, how could Sizhui worry about such things when there was always an endless line of aunties bringing snacks to the penthouse his father shared with his uncle? It\u2019s in the same building that he met Jingyi, both of them having been enrolled in the Lan family day care managed by Jingyi\u2019s cousins on the first floor. \nSizhui is brought back to reality when a black rabbit circles around his knee, begging for attention. He pets it absently and turns to Jin Ling. \u201cDo you visit your uncles a lot?\u201d\n\u201cI see Xiaojiu on the weekends,\u201d Jin Lin says, now feeding a white rabbit a green bean with utmost focus. \u201cDajiu\u2019s place is so messy, and he\u2019s never home anyway.\u201d\n\u201cYour Dajiu is\u2026 Dr. Wei?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s adopted. So I definitely don\u2019t have any of his crazy genes.\u201d\nSizhui pauses. \u201cAre you close to him?\u201d\nThis is the point where Jin Lin looks up. \u201cWhy are you asking me so much about him? He\u2019s famous, isn\u2019t he? Go look him up on Baidu if you want to join his fan club.\u201d\nEven Jingyi seems to have taken notice of the direction of this conversation. \u201cI want to know how someone so casual can end up as a surgeon! Maybe there\u2019s hope for me yet!\u201d\n\u201cYou, as a doctor?\u201d Jin Ling snorts, plucking at a patch of long grass near him. \u201cYeah right. He apparently wanted to be a mortician and work with dead people, but my grandma put her foot down. She said she didn\u2019t send him to medical school for this and told him to become a real doctor.\u201d\n\u201cHey, why can\u2019t I be a doctor? What does your uncle have that I don\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cA brain, for starters-\u201d\nSizhui interrupts the brewing argument by handing Jingyi his rabbit. \u201cLet\u2019s not fight. It\u2019ll upset them. And Classmate Jin-\u201d\n\u201cCall me by my name,\u201d Jin Ling cuts in. \u201cYou sound like a teacher.\u201d\n\u201cJin Ling-\u201d \n\u201cNot you,\u201d Jin Ling snaps at Jingyi, who laughs and leans back until he\u2019s lying on the ground, stray rabbits nipping at the ends of his hair. \nSizhui brushes some grass out of Jingyi\u2019s hair and smiles at Jin Ling. \u201cThank you for helping us.\u201d\nThis makes Jin Ling frown, his face twisting into a sour expression. He looks away as if embarrassed. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me. This is our punishment. I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll still come back after our detention is over,\u201d Sizhui says. Would you like to join us?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. If I\u2019m free.\u201d\nJingyi and Sizhui share a look. They both know that Jin Ling will be back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat evening, Sizhui retires to his dorm room and sends new photos of the rabbits to his family WeChat group. He also includes pictures of Jingyi teaching Jin Ling how to change water bottles in the play pen, Jin Ling obviously distracted as a spoiled bunny nibbles on the sleeves of his yellow shirt. \nThe reply is almost immediate:\nGreat Uncle: This is your punishment. Take it seriously.\nFather: Good\nFather: [Sticker]\nThe thumbs up sticker, coupled with his father\u2019s succinctness, makes Sizhui laugh.\nSizhui is already getting ready for bed when his uncle replies. He hadn\u2019t expected him to respond at all, Lan Xichen being on an extended business trip to Beijing to discuss the acquisition of new artifacts with the Palace Museum. Sizhui\u2019s uncle is undoubtedly the face of the Lan family, their decades of history in the preservation of cultural heritage goods putting the Lans firmly in the category of old money. The modest nature of the home Sizhui shares with his father and uncle is only betrayed by the value of their musical instruments. \nUncle: Are you having fun with Young Master Jin?\nIt\u2019s a private conversation outside of their group chat. The last message Sizhui\u2019s uncle had sent him privately was over eight months ago, asking Sizhui if he needed help selecting a birthday gift for his father. His uncle has always been more perceptive than most.\nSizhui: Jin Ling likes the rabbits\nSizhui: His uncle is Dr. Wei\nUncle: Yes, I am aware. I\u2019m an old acquaintance of Jin Ling\u2019s mother-- Dr. Wei\u2019s sister.\nUncle: I believe Dr. Wei now works with your cousins\nThis is news to Sizhui, who hasn\u2019t spoken to his cousins lately. It\u2019s embarrassing to remember how badly Sizhui reacted the year he turned seven and Wen Qing had come knocking on Lan Wangji\u2019s door, asking the Lan family to return custody of Sizhui to herself and her brother. They were easily the closest living relatives of Sizhui\u2019s deceased parents, who had been acquaintances with the Lan family. Yet, an internal power struggle with Wen Ruohan had made the extended Wen family powerless in the face of his wrath, forcing Lan Wangji to adopt Sizhui as way of protecting him. It had all been too complex, or perhaps too real for Sizhui to understand at the time. He had burst into tears at the thought of being separated from his adopted father. In the face of Sizhui\u2019s obvious distress, they had arrived at the conclusion that Sizhui would stay with the Lan family and be allowed to interact with his cousins when he felt ready. \nSizhui liked Wen Ning and Wen Qing perfectly well, especially after their move from Qishan to Shanghai in recent years. Whatever awkwardness between them dissolved after their first trip together to the Wen family graves during the Qingming Festival. Seeing Wen Ning bowing to the tombstones had made Sizhui feel like he wasn\u2019t just the adopted child of Lan Wangji. Like he had a greater purpose in the grand scheme of everything.\nNow, Sizhui wonders if some cosmic force is connecting everyone in his life together. \nThe gears in Sizhui\u2019s head begin to turn. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShanghai Children\u2019s Hospital is a solid fifty-minute bus ride from Gusu, but Sizhui still braves the trip with the excuse of visiting his cousins. He almost gets lost on the way, but receives directions from an elderly woman after helping her cross the street. Surprisingly, Wen Ning is not waiting for him at the front as promised, so Sizhui makes his way to the third floor and asks around. The floor is full, and someone almost brushes him off when he asks for Head Nurse Wen. \n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of busy here! Any unsolicited visitors need to go to-\u201d\n\u201cA-Yuan! You\u2019re here.\u201d Wen Qing appears then, looking stern as always in her white coat. Still, her gaze softens at the sight of Sizhui. \u201cNurse Zhang, this is my cousin.\u201d\nThe nurse flushes immediately. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Director Wen!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble!\u201d Sizhui insists. \u201cSorry to bother you!\u201d He doesn\u2019t hear the nurse\u2019s reply before Wen Qing steers him in the direction of her office. \nWen Qing cuts an impressive figure, and Sizhui notes the way the staff parts around her with obvious respect. They soon arrive in front of a door, completely nondescript if not for theWen Qing, Director of Cardiology plaque on the front. Wen Qing pushes it open and gestures for Sizhui to sit. When Sizhui offers her the sweets he\u2019d brought from Gusu, she frowns. \u201cI told you to stop bringing us gifts! We\u2019re supposed to take care of you! Not the other way around!\u201d\nSizhui is about to respond when Wen Ning comes through the door, his scrubs rolled up to his elbows. \u201cJie! A-Yuan! Sorry I couldn\u2019t come fetch you! There was a situation with a patient, but I\u2019m free now!\u201d\n\u201cYou better be free,\u201d Wen Qing says while browsing through some files on her nearly organized desk. There\u2019s a single window in the office overlooking a courtyard. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day A-Yuan comes poking around with the facade of visiting us.\u201d When Sizhui is lost for words, she looks at him. \u201cWell, am I wrong?\u201d\nWhile Sizhui tries to think of what to say, Wen Ning smiles. \u201cJie sees through everything. Don\u2019t worry about it! Why don\u2019t you tell us why you came? Are you sick? Do you need something?\u201d\nHonesty is the best policy, so eventually Sizhui settles on, \u201cI came to ask you about someone.\u201d\nWen Ning and Wen Qing share a look.\n\u201cI met someone who works with you-- Dr. Wei Wuxian? He\u2019s the uncle of a classmate.\u201d Whatever Sizhui expected, it\u2019s not Wen Qing rolling her eyes. \n\u201cHe\u2019s a disaster,\u201d Wen Qing says, tapping her fingers on her desk. \u201cLoud, obnoxious, and unprofessional. He\u2019s also the best pediatric surgeon in this hospital, possibly in this province. Did Lan Xichen tell you about him?\u201d\nSizhui pauses. \u201cWhy did you assume Uncle is the one who told me?\u201d\n\u201cAs if Lan Wangji would openly talk about anything. If you must know, Wei Wuxian was one of my classmates from Beida Medical School. He\u2019s a genius, but his head is in the clouds. That guy almost got himself expelled multiple times, yet he managed to work his way into the operating room to prove his worth. He was doing a residency at Yiling East when-\u201d Wen Qing pauses. \u201cWhen you were brought into the hospital.\u201d\nWhile Wen Qing deliberates her next words, Wen Ning pours some tea for Sizhui. \n\u201cYiling East was a small hospital very low on funding. No one wanted to work there in the long run. Wen Ruohan had his hands deep in political stuff, but he also owned a good chunk of property and businesses in Qishan and Yiling. Wei Wuxian getting assigned there was supposed to be a lesson in humility, but he managed to do the impossible.\u201d\n\u201cDr. Wei still does the impossible,\u201d Wen Ning explains kindly. \nSizhui takes a sip of his tea. He\u2019s surprise to find that it\u2019s the variety he had given Wen Qing over the summer. \u201cYou mentioned my father knowing him?\u201d\nThe tapping on Wen Qing\u2019s desk resumes. \u201cLan Wangji knew Wei Wuxian even before all this. I have no clue how. Even back then, they had a love-hate relationship.\u201d\n\u201cJie! Don\u2019t call it that-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m calling it what it is. The two of them could never agree on anything, yet Wei Wuxian took such delight in bothering Lan Wangji. I don\u2019t understand any of it. I would avoid that guy, A-Yuan. He brings trouble everywhere he-\u201d\nThe door to Wen Qing\u2019s office opens as if on cue. A familiar figure pushes in with his back against the door, his face buried in documents. \u201cWen Qing, my patient got transferred to Cardiology. I need you to look through- Oh. Am I interrupting something? Is this a party?\u201d\nWen Qing looks exasperated. \u201cSpeak of the devil.\u201d\n\u201cSuch high praise!\u201d Wei Wuxian laughs. He\u2019s clad in black scrubs underneath the white coat, looking younger than Shizui remembers. There\u2019s a red clip holding back a handful of his bangs, as if a child had haphazardly placed it there. \u201cShould I come back later?\u201d\n\u201cWe were just talking about you,\u201d Wen Ning says with a smile. He carefully accepts the files from Wei Wuxian and puts them on his sister\u2019s desk. \nWei Wuxian turns to Sizhui. \u201cSlander! Don\u2019t believe anything she says about me!\u201d He squints. \u201cWhy do you look so familiar?\u201d\n\u201cYou have advanced Alzheimer's,\u201d Wen Qing tsks. \n\u201cI have a selective memory!\u201d Wei Wuxian protests as Wen Ning tries to hide his laughter and fails. \nSizhui stands up. \u201cDr. Wei. We met briefly last week in Headmaster Lan\u2019s office. Do you remember?\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s entire face lights up. \u201cYou\u2019re Ling-er\u2019s friend! Eh.. Lan Zhan\u2019s kid?\u201d\n\u201cIdiot,\u201d Wen Qing says. \u201cThis is A-Yuan, our cousin. Don\u2019t you remember? You got into a fight with Director Xu at Yiling East over him!\u201d\nWei Wuxian waits a beat, then two, before recognition flickers in his eyes. \u201cWen Yuan? Really? Little Wen Yuan?\u201d His hands land on Sizhui\u2019s shoulders as he turns Sizhui around, examining him. \u201cYou\u2019re so tall now! Wow\u2026 That\u2019s crazy\u2026 How are you doing? Any trouble breathing? Do you play sports? Let me see your surgery scar-\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s inappropriate!\u201d Wen Qing cuts in when Wei Wuxian starts touching Sizhui\u2019s coat. \u201cThis is why you\u2019re getting passed over for the vice head of department!\u201d\nWhile Wei Wuxian banters with his cousin, Sizhui collects his thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m doing fine, Dr. Wei. I don\u2019t have any problems running. The scars are barely visible.\u201d\n\u201cGood!!\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cI was so shocked when I saw Lan Zhan with you! I thought, who in the world would marry Lan Zhan? I was the only person he didn\u2019t kill with that ice prince glare, but not for lack of trying! He never spoke to me about wanting to start a family, so I thought...\u201d He trailed off, seemingly unaware of the implications of his rambling. \n\u201cI-\u201d Sizhui opens his mouth. \u201cFather is not married.\u201d\nWei Wuxian blinks at him. \u201cOh! Well. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that! Being a bachelor is the life! A life I wouldn\u2019t know, anyway!\u201d\nSizhui has no clue where this is going. His mouth, however, seems to have a mind of its own. \u201cDr. Wei\u2026 Are-Are you seeing someone?\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Is Old Man Lan teaming up with Madam Yu now?\u201d Wei Wuxian straightens up, hand on his chin. He looks thoughtful. \u201cShe has too much power\u2026 I thought Jiang Cheng would be her next target for sure, but now she\u2019s even sending kids to investigate me-\u201d\n\u201cWhat in the world are you talking about?\u201d Wen Qing demands the same time a ruffled looking nurse comes in.\n\u201cDr. Wei! There you are! Dr. Xi from Endocrinology needs you. He says it\u2019s urgent.\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s expression changes immediately, and for once Sizhui sees someone older, more focused. \u201cSorry, talk to you later. Wen Qing, you\u2019ll get back to me about the arrhythmia patient, yeah?\u201d He barely waits for her reply before following the nurse into the hallway.\nThankfully, Wen Qing waits until the door is closed again before speaking. \u201cThat\u2019s just how he is. Wei Wuxian remembers patient history down to the date but not their faces. He can recall articles from obscure medical journals but doesn\u2019t remember what he had for lunch.\u201d\n\u201cDr. Wei is definitely an interesting person,\u201d Wen Ning adds. \u201cBut he\u2019s popular with the parents and children, and his success rate is undeniably high.\u201d \n\u201cWhat\u2019s high is my blood pressure after dealing with him.\u201d Wen Qing says, but Sizhui is used to her roundabout way of showing approval. \u201cSo. Whatever little plan you\u2019re formulating in that head of yours-- I want nothing to do with it. Wei Wuxian is so troublesome. It\u2019s bad enough he forces us to go drinking with him every month.\u201d\n\u201cJie!\u201d Wen Ning laughs, already gathering jackets from the coat rack. \u201cYou enjoy those drinking sessions! You have the most fun out of all of us! Anyways, A-Yuan. It\u2019s getting late. Let\u2019s go get dinner as promised, mmh?\u201d\n\u201cDinner sounds great,\u201d Sizhui says. He\u2019s thankful neither of them brings up Sizhui\u2019s weird interaction with Wei Wuxian again, but he knows fully well this is far from over.\nSizhui needs to speak to his uncle.\nLan Jingyi may not be the most perceptive person at school, but he\u2019s fully aware that Sizhui is Up To Something. Jingyi is no stranger to Sizhui\u2019s contemplative moods, especially after a decade of friendship spent causing trouble (Jingyi), cleaning up the mess (Sizhui), and charming aunties along the way (a little bit Jingyi, but mostly Sizhui). Thus, Jingyi easily recognizes the subtle restlessness in Sizhui\u2019s behavior.\nIt\u2019s a true testament to Jingyi\u2019s maturity that he doesn\u2019t bug Sizhui immediately, which is what Jingyi did everyday when they were ten until Shizui told Jingyi what he wanted for his birthday. Jingyi also knows that something shifts between them and Jin Ling after the Dog Incident, and they begin seeing him more at detention, in the hallways between classes, and sometimes in the dorm common areas when Jin Ling deigns to grace them with his presence.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so great about Jin Ling?\u201d Jingyi asks Sizhui once, when they\u2019re working on a literature assignment together. \u201cHe\u2019s prickly. Do you think he\u2019s fun to tease?\u201d\nSizhui smiles. \u201cNo. I think you think he\u2019s fun to tease.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Jingyi mumbles. \u201cAnd let me see your answers! I have no clue what number 4 is asking!\u201d\nDuring their week of joint detention, Jingyi learns that Jin Ling has a weakness for fluffy things and also a habit of vehemently denying his fondness for said fluffy things. He also notices that Sizhui has taken a weird interest in Jin Ling\u2019s family. This bewilders Jingyi because Sizhui is normally the least nosy person he knows, preferring to gather information through observation than gossip.\nJingyi really doesn\u2019t understand the connection. Jin Ling is haughty and quick tempered, and probably a bit young to be in some of Jingyi\u2019s classes. Sizhui, on the other hand, has been voted twice as the Class Prince according to a survey of 100 female students at Cloud Recesses conducted by Ouyang Zizhen\u2019s sister. Not that Jingyi pays attention to these things.\nFor the most part, Jin Ling keeps to himself. Jingyi is aware of Jin Ling\u2019s reputation even before accidentally setting his dog loose. The kids at Cloud Recess call Jin Ling spoiled and rude. They say he only entered the school due to family connections, which makes no sense to Jingyi since Cloud Recess has always been a place for rich families to feed their children. Jingyi himself had only gotten in due to a subsidized fund made available to everyone in the Lan family. Even so, most of his cousins preferred public education to the rigid rules of the boarding school.\nJingyi would feel more obligated to be a better upperclassman if Jin Ling wasn\u2019t so unrepentant. Still, they end up unconsciously spending more time with Jin Ling -- arguing about sports in the canteen, comparing answers to their English homework after class, and cleaning the rabbit pens together in their spare time.\nOn Wednesday, Jingyi spots Jin Ling with his archery bag in the dorm halls. \u201cHey Hotshot! Off to practice?\u201d\n\u201cPractice just ended,\u201d Jin Ling replies, the beginnings of a telltale frown obvious on his face. \u201cI need to do maintenance on my bow.\u201d\nJingyi eyes the black bag slung over Jin Ling\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCan I see?\u201d\n\u201cSee what?\u201d\n\u201cYour bow, of course! Unless that\u2019s actually your dog in that bag and you\u2019ve smuggled him in again?\u201d\nJin Ling flushes immediately. \u201cOf course not!\u201d He swings the bag around and unzips it to pull out a sleek-looking brown bow. \u201cHere it is, the Striker RK1 60 Takedown Recurve,\u201d he says proudly.\nJingyi asks \u201cCan I hold it?\u201d at the same time Sizhui appears and says, \u201cThat looks very nice.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Jin Ling mumbles, reluctantly handing it over. He looks concerned at the way Jingyi holds the frame.\n\u201cDon\u2019t look so scared, I\u2019m not gonna break it.\u201d Jingyi turns it over in his hands. \u201cHuh. This looks a lot like the one in the guestroom of Sizhui\u2019s house.\u201d\nSizhui shakes his head, a stack of papers in his arm, probably left over from his student council meeting. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know about that.\u201d\n\u201cThis is top of the line,\u201d Jin Ling huffs, making a grabby hands motion until Jingyi returns his bow. \u201cIt can\u2019t possibly compare to whatever you\u2019re using as wall decoration!\u201d\nThis elicits a thoughtful hum from Sizhui. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the market value. All I know is that it was a gift from Zhang Xieming to Great Uncle.\u201d\n\u201cZhang Xieming?!\u201d Jin Ling blurts out, then lowers his voice inconspicuously. He takes a step forward, the bow clenched close to his chest. \u201cThree time Olympian? Gold medalist at the 2000 Olympics? That Zhang Xieming?\u201d\nSizhui takes a step back. \u201cYes. I believe it\u2019s the one he used in 1996.\u201d\n\u201cFrom his Olympic debut?\u201d Jin Ling\u2019s eyes are visibly sparkling now.\nSizhui looks mildly amused. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend of my Great Uncle and donated it for a Lan family charity auction. Apparently some third party sellers got ahold of his later models around that time and began auctioning those off at a higher price, so Great Uncle decided to keep it.\u201d\nJingyi remembers all the times he\u2019d received firm looks of disapproval from Han Guang-Jun for touching it. \u201cThat old thing? We used to play around with it all the time.\u201d\n\u201cThat \u2018old thing\u2019 is a piece of history!\u201d Jin Ling insists. He then becomes aware of his own enthusiasm and falls silent.\nAfter a moment, Sizhui ventures, \u201cWould you like to see it?\u201d\n\u201c... Can I?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going home with Sizhui this weekend,\u201d Jingyi points out, remembering the jeans he\u2019d haphazardly thrown into his overnight bag. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just come with us? You can look at that old-\u201d\nJin Ling glares.\n\u201cOkay, you can admire that piece of history while we play the new Monster Hunter Game.\u201d Jingyi doesn\u2019t add that he\u2019s only staying with Sizhui on the premise of working on their history project so his mother won\u2019t talk his ear off for slacking off all weekend.\nJin Ling considers this. \u201cI guess \u2026 I\u2019ll have to ask my uncles first. I usually have lunch with them on Sundays.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come home with Jingyi and I on Friday? You can leave on Sunday morning to make it to lunch?\u201d Sizhui suggests. \u201cOr you can ask them to pick up? My home is a bit far from the academy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll work something out,\u201d Jin Ling says, carefully tucking his bow back into the bag. His phone vibrates then, and Jin Ling digs it out of his pockets to frown at the screen. \u201cMy mom is calling. I\u2019ll talk to you guys later.\u201d Then he\u2019s gone, rushing in the direction of his room.\nIt\u2019s not until Jin Ling disappears around the corner that Sizhui turns to Jingyi. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nJingyi blinks. \u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\u201cFor being you,\u201d Sizhui says with a soft smile. \u201cDid you want to go over our math problem set?\u201d\nIt\u2019s then that Jingyi remembers his subpar grade and the ambitious vow he made about acing their next test. \u201cYeah!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Friday afternoon, they meet Jin Ling at the main exit of the dorm. Well, more like Jingyi waits while Sizhui engages everyone that passes by in polite conversation. By the time Jin Ling shows up with his tacky gold suitcase, Sizhui has already been invited to two parties, a study group, and dinner with an overzealous first-year whose family owns half of Hangzhou.\n\u201cPerfect timing!\u201d Jingyi decides, looping one arm through Jin Ling\u2019s and the other though Sizhui\u2019s. \u201cSorry, Classmate Liu! We\u2019re leaving for the weekend and have a bus to catch! Maybe next time!\u201d\n\u201cSlow down!\u201d Jin Ling demands after Jingyi manhandles the two of them half the distance towards the East Gate. \u201cWhere's the fire? And why are you freakishly strong?\u201d\nJingyi drops both boys\u2019 arms and shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of practice. And why did you pack so much? You\u2019re only staying for two nights!\u201d\n\u201cI like to be prepared,\u201d Jin Ling huffs, rubbing tenderly at his elbow where Jingyi had previously grabbed him. His gaze moves from the simple overnight bag across Jingyi\u2019s shoulders to Sizhui\u2019s lone backpack.\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of room for your stuff,\u201d Sizhui reassures him as they arrive at the gate. He glances around and lifts his arm. \u201cI already notified my father of your arrival. He instructed me to call a taxi.\u201d\nJin Ling pushes Sizhui\u2019s outreached arm down. \u201cI thought we were taking the bus!?\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have Little Mistress Jin travel amongst commoners!\u201d Jingyi mock gasps. Around them, students look in their direction while meeting chauffeurs at the gate, no doubt also going home for the weekend.\n\u201cI\u2019m not that spoiled!\u201d Jin Ling says, his cheeks red. \u201cI, too, can understand the proletariat spirit!\u201d\nJingyi can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s hearing. \u201cYou\u2019re not the proletariat! You\u2019re the bourgeois!\u201d He laughs even more when Jin Ling makes a grabbing motion at him as if to punch him, completely unthreatening. Jingyi just grips his outstretched hands and ends up swinging Jin Ling\u2019s arms around, like Jingyi often does with his toddler relatives.\n\u201cOur taxi is here,\u201d Sizhui declares then, reaching for Jin Ling\u2019s stuff. \u201cPlease don\u2019t feel bad. The bus takes too long and my father is expecting us.\u201d He\u2019s already holding the door to the back seat open, so Jingyi lets go of Jin Ling.\n\u201cAfter you,\u201d Jingyi tells Jin Ling, who glares at him but scoots into the waiting car. Jingyi follows after throwing his bag into the trunk next to Jin Ling\u2019s suitcase. He closes the door just as Sizhui finishes giving the driver directions.\nWhen Jingyi asks Jin Ling if his seat is comfortable enough, Sizhui turns around and says, \u201cJingyi, please behave.\u201d\n\u201cI always behave!\u201d Still, Jingyi doesn\u2019t tease Jin Ling for the rest of the ride. They miraculously make it to the entrance of the Lan neighborhood before rush hour hits, Sizhui paying the driver while Jingyi tugs both his and Jin Ling\u2019s luggage out of the trunk.\nJin Ling grabs the handle of his suitcase and glances around. \u201cThis entire neighborhood is for your family? How many of you are there?\u201d\n\u201cNot the entire neighborhood,\u201d Sizhui replies easily. He leads the way through the entrance, greeting the guards on duty who recognize Sizhui and Jingyi immediately. \u201cThis area has belonged to the Lan family for centuries, but it was reconstructed into a gated community a few decades ago. Now there\u2019s only a dozen complexes, and only half of the buildings have been portioned off to Lans.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re mostly older folks,\u201d Jingyi explains as they pass by the main garden area. \u201cOr families who have lived here for so long they don\u2019t want to relocate. A lot of people have moved out, but the elders want to retire here, and parents like the communal amenities. Oh, Ayi! Hello!\u201d Jingyi waves at the sight of a familiar auntie who\u2019s holding the hand of a small child. The little boy waves back cluelessly.\nJin Ling just hums in response, looking around as he takes in the playground in the distance. He stays silent when they pass a lady pushing a stroller, the auntie welcoming Sizhui and Jingyi back while the baby makes cooing sounds at Jin Ling. \u201cThis is nice,\u201d Jin Ling says.\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Sizhui agrees as they arrive at the foot of the main complex. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cDo you live here too?\u201d Jin Ling asks Jingyi while they check in at security. Once again, the guards at the desk greets Sizhui warmly.\n\u201cNah! My parents live three buildings down.\u201d Jingyi shrugs once they're cleared.\nThe elevator ride to the top floor is fast, and they don\u2019t encounter anyone else on the way up. Sizhui punches in the passcode to the penthouse speedily, and soon they\u2019re stepping into the entryway, the light from the floor to ceiling windows illuminating the entire area.\nLan Wangji stands a feet meters away, as if waiting for them. \u201cSizhui, welcome back.\u201d\n\u201cHello, Father.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for having me, Han Guang-Jun!\u201d Jingyi chimes in while stepping out of his shoes.\nLan Wangji shoots him the same look of passive approval he\u2019s been giving Jingyi for years, ever since he first asked Jingyi to call him shushu. As if Jingyi could actually call one of the heirs of the Lan family \u201cUncle.\u201d Jingyi\u2019s mother, in particular, likes to remind Jingyi of how popular Han Guang-Jun is with women, children, and elders alike. Jingyi is pretty sure Shanghai Weekly even ranks the man at the top of the bachelors list, making it even harder for Jingyi to address Lan Wangji by anything but his title.\nEventually, Jin Ling gulps and adds, \u201cThank you for letting me stay over.\u201d He looks almost in awe of Sizhui\u2019s father, whose gaze sweeps across Jin Ling as if evaluating him. Sometimes Jingyi forgets how intimidating Han Guang-Jun can be.\n\u201cNo need,\u201d Lan Wangji says evenly. \u201cSizhui\u2019s friends are always welcomed. I need to take care of some business. Sizhui, show your guests to their quarters. We will leave for dinner in thirty minutes.\u201d\nScore, Jingyi thinks as he follows Sizhui to the guest room. He knows the layout of this floor by heart, so Jingyi effortlessly opens the door and throws himself across the queen sized bed. Next to him, Jin Ling gasps as he spots the infamous bow on display on the shelves.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t lying,\u201d Jin Ling whispers as Sizhui opens the display case. He touches the frame of the bow gently, as if approaching a small animal. \u201cWow.\u201d\n\u201cIs it that impressive?\u201d Jingyi wonders, rolling over on the bed.\nJin Ling doesn\u2019t seems to be listening, too busy turning the bow around in his hands.\n\u201cLet him be,\u201d Sizhui says as he goes to open the curtains. He does the regular round of checking the area for dust, but the room is spotless like everything else in Sizhui\u2019s home. Still, Sizhui moves Jingyi\u2019s bag from the floor to the dresser. He disappears for a moment and returns with extra blankets that he sets at the end of the bed. Also tucked under his arms is a book of some sort. \u201cJin Ling, you\u2019ll be staying in my room.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jin Ling turns around. \u201cWhy not in here?\u201d\nThis is news to Jingyi too. He knows for a fact that this penthouse has no less than five spacious rooms belonging to Han Guang-Jun, Ze Wu-Jun, and Sizhui. Not to mention the private study and this guest room. The living room and kitchen combined are large enough to cover Jingyi\u2019s parents\u2019 entire unit.\n\u201cWe only have one bed in here, and I can\u2019t ask you to share with Jingyi. So you will be sleeping in my room.\u201d\nWhen Jin Ling begins to argue, Sizhui pulls out the book, which turns out to be a photo album. \u201cI told my uncle about the bow, and he suggested I look through these albums. They may contain photos of Zhang Xieming with Great Uncle. Would you like to take a look?\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d\nSizhui takes a seat on the edge of the bed and Jin Ling follows. Even Jingyi feels obligated to sit up as well, peering over Sizhui\u2019s shoulder as he opens the cover.\nThe album begins with faded photos of a younger Headmaster Lan. Jingyi can\u2019t believe his eyes as he\u2019s faced with undeniable proof that once upon a time, Headmaster Lan\u2019s face wasn\u2019t permanently glued into a frown. The photos must be from at least three decades ago, for most of the pictures include faces Jingyi has never seen before or doesn\u2019t recognize. Jin Ling\u2019s hero appears soon enough, arms folded as he stands side by side with Headmaster Lan, both of them caught mid-laughter. Sizhui carefully removes the photo from the plastic covering and turns it around to reveal a handwritten message from the archer.\nWhile Jin Ling reads over the scribbled note, Sizhui continues perusing. There are a few empty pages before the paper quality changes drastically, and the pictures begin featuring two almost identical looking boys.\nJingyi squints. \u201cOh my god! Is that Ze Wu-Jun and Han Guang-Jun as kids?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Sizhui says softly, touching the protective covering. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen these before.\u201d\nThis is gold, Jingyi thinks as he urges Sizhui to continue. They\u2019re awarded with a few more adolescent snapshots of the famous brothers before coming across a photo of them standing in front of the Cloud Recesses gates, Headmaster Lan posing behind them. Even more baffling is the next page containing a commemorative photo from a competition of some sort, the subjects all standing in front of a podium.\n\u201cWow. Han Guang-Jun must be around our age here.\u201d Jingyi blinks at the sight of a familiar jawline and sharp eyes. \u201cWhy does this guy look so much like Jin Ling?\u201d\nJin Ling turns his attention back on them. His gaze drops down to the album for a second before his mouth opens. \u201cT-that\u2019s my dad!\u201d\nOn second thought, the resemblance is almost uncanny. They can pass for brothers, even, with the way Jin Ling\u2019s father is pseudo-glaring into the camera. Looking constipated must run in the family, Jingyi thinks.\n\u201cWait, that\u2019s Xiaojiu!\u201d Jin Ling says, pointing at someone at the end of the lineup. He then points at the figure standing next to the young Han Guang-Jun. \u201cAnd that\u2019s Dajiu!\u201d\nSizhui and Jingyi put their heads together to look. Sure enough, a young Wei Wuxian stands to the right of Sizhui\u2019s father, an insufferable grin on his face as he holds what appears to be the first place trophy. At the end of the photo is Jiang Cheng, looking like he wants to hit Wei Wuxian with said trophy. Lan Wangji\u2019s own expression is unreadable.\n\u201cI need to take a photo of this,\u201d Jin Ling decides, pulling out his phone. He looks at Sizhui for a moment. \u201cCan I?\u201d\nSizhui moves the album towards Jin Ling in response.\nJingyi tests his luck. \u201cCan I take a photo of Headmaster Lan without his goatee?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer if you didn\u2019t,\u201d Sizhui says with a grimace, which is about what Jingyi expects.\nThey\u2019re already done with the album when Lan Wangji appears in the doorway. His eyes linger on the cover for a moment, but he does nothing to address it. \u201cIt is time for dinner.\u201d\nJin Ling seems to have other plans. \u201cHan Guang-Jun! Do you know my dad?\u201d\nThe room is silent for a good minute as Lan Wangji stares at Jin Ling, who straightens his spine under his scrutiny. \u201cI was schoolmates with your father.\u201d\n\u201cAnd my uncles?\u201d\n\u201cJiang Wanyin and Wei Ying too.\u201d\nWhen it becomes obvious that his father will not offer any more information, Sizhui gives Jin Ling an apologetic smile. \u201cLet\u2019s get going.\u201d\nJingyi nudges Jin Ling a little, but Jin Ling doesn\u2019t deflate until after Lan Wangji leaves the room. The three of them follow him into the foyer for their shoes, and then down the escalator where Sizhui updates his father on the bow, the photo of Zhang Xieming, and his alleged connection with Headmaster Lan.\n\u201cUncle is acquainted with many people,\u201d Lan Wangji says while they walk towards a family restaurant outside of the neighborhood. He gives Jin Ling a look. \u201cHe will tell you about Athlete Zhang if you ask.\u201d\nJin Ling shrinks a little under his gaze. \u201cHeadmaster Lan said he doesn\u2019t want to see me or my uncle again!\u201d\n\u201cWas Dr. Wei a troublemaker?\u201d Jingyi asks as they\u2019re nearing the restaurant. It\u2019s a popular spot, hovering in between a casual street shop and somewhere stuffy and upscale.\n\u201cWei Ying was \u2026 the worst,\u201d Han Guang-Jun says before the proprietor appears and welcomes them inside. When he doesn\u2019t elaborate, Jin Ling mumurs something along the lines of, that sounds about right. \nThey\u2019re seated at a table towards the back of the shop, the other patrons chatting amicably around them while Sizhui and Jingyi are tasked with ordering.\n\"What would you like to eat?\" Sizhui hands a menu to Jin Ling, who scans rapidly through the options before replying that anything is fine. Jin Ling is obviously being overly polite, as if he's afraid of mistepping.\n\"Alright,\" Sizhui says and puts in the orders with the waiter. In the time it takes for their side dishes to come, Sizhui updates his father on his studies, the state of the student council, and the rabbits. The only reaction he elicits is a noise of acknowledgement. Sizhui and Jingyi are used this, both of them having grown up with Lan Wangji as a quiet but firm presence. This, however, only seems to stress Jin Ling more, and their little mistress looks almost startled by the time the food comes out.\n\"Is it not to your liking?\" Lan Wangji asks after a soup noodle dish is placed in front of Jin Ling.\nJingyi peers over at Jin Ling, who can barely lift his eyes up to meet Lan Wangji. Instead, he stares resolutely at the soup, a signature dish the shop is famous for. Even though the entire Lan family has bland tastes, Jingyi knows for a fact that the noodle soup is perfectly savory.\n\"I can order something else,\" Sizhui offers the same time his father pushes the chili oil bottle on the table towards Jin Ling.\nAfter a moment of silence, Jin Ling accepts the bottle and adds a few drop to his food. \u201cT-Thank you.\u201d\n\"There's no need to be so formal. You are Sizhui's friend and I am acquainted with your parents.\"\nFor a moment, Jingyi is afraid Lan Wangji ask Jin Ling to call him \"Lan-Shushu\" which would actually kill Jin Ling with embarrassment. Still, the relief on Jin Ling's face is obvious as he begins eating. He doesn't even protest when Sizhui moves some of the side dishes closer to Jin Ling, reminding him to eat slowly.\n\"How did you know he wanted the chili oil?\" Jingyi asks with a mouthful of his own noodles.\nLan Wangji puts down his tea cup. \"Just speculation.\"\n\"My mom's side of the family all like spicy food,\" Jin Ling explains. \"My dad has low tolerance though, so I inherited my mom's genes.\" He looks almost proud at this. \"Laolao is from Meishan, right outside of Chengdu, so she can outeat anyone with it comes to mala except...\"\nJingyi raises an eyebrow. \"Except?\"\nThe conversation is interrupted when the waiter returns with more hot water for their tea, which reminds Jingyi of the time the Chinese Tea Club tried to cook their own Pu-erh tea. He shares the story of how the failed fermentation attempt led to the chemistry classroom to smell for weeks. \"The vice president of the club tried to give away the rest. She's my biology lab partner and gave me cookies with pu-erh baked into them!\"\n\"They were very unique,\" Sizhui says.\n\"They were nasty!\"\nDinner continues with Sizhui and Jingyi taking turns sharing anecdotes from school. Lan Wangji listens dutifully, but it's Jin Ling who seems most interested in their stories. \"Is Lanling so boring that nothing interesting ever happened at your school?\" Jingyi asks when Lan Wangji goes to pay the bill.\n\"I don't know,\" Jin Ling says, tugging at the end of the table clothes. \"I was homeschooled by private tutors. Nainai wanted to send me to boarding school in America, but my parents convinced her that coming to Cloud Recesses was better.\"\n So rich people have their own brand of problems, Jingyi thinks. \"Why America? You're not even good at English.\"\n\"I know!\" Jin Ling says, his voice more relieved at the acknowledgment of the truth than annoyed.\nThe walk back to the complex is peaceful, and they encounter a handful of people in the courtyard taking evening strolls. When Lan Wangji gets pulled into conversation with an elderly grandpa, he instructs them to go home first. Sizhui leads them back inside, where he turns on the lights and carefully adjusts all the curtains. The penthouse itself is pretty bare, filled only with essential but artisanal furniture. Sizhui is showing Jin Ling the switch for the heated floors when the door opens, and Lan Wangji appears with an unexpected visitor.\n\"M-mom?!\" Jingyi gapes. It's not the first time his mother has visited, but she usually doesn\u2019t interrupt sleepovers. Jingyi closes his mouth immediately at the sight of a box tucked under her arm. \"What are you doing-\"\n\"Oh, stop acting!\" Jingyi's mother huffs, hands on her hips as she ascends on Jingyi. \"You think I wouldn't notice the charge on your father's card? Just because he's scatter brained doesn't mean I am! I was wondering there you mailed this thing, but thankfully I ran into Han Guang-Jun a couple of days ago at the mailboxes and saw him take this out!\" She thrusts the game in Jingyi's face. \"Lan Jingyi, where did you learn to be such a troublemaker?!\"\nJingyi really should've asked Sizhui to order the game for him. His mother catches on immediately to his train of thought, and her hand lands on Jingyi's ear before twisting it. \"Ouch! Mom! That hurts!\"\n\"Good! I'm confiscating this game! You're not allowed to play it until you raise your mathematics grade! Honestly, math was my best subject at school. I don't know where you get your bad genes from, probably from your dad!\"\nSizhui, in a charitable act truly befitting of the Class Prince, takes pity on Jingyi and steps in. \"Ayi, maybe you should let him go.\"\nThe grip on Jingyi's ear loosens, and Jingyi automatically goes to massage his poor ear. This is so embarrassing. Even Jin Ling is doing his best not to laugh.\n\"You too, Sizhui! Don't just go along with my son\u2019s plans!\"\nSizhui puts his hands up to placate her. \"It's not Jingyi's fault. I um, I also wanted to play the game.\" It's an obvious lie that no one bothers to point out.\n\"Either way,\" Jingyi's mom continues. \"I'm already late to go dancing at the square. Lin-Ayi is waiting for me downstairs. I can\u2019t believe you, making me come all the way up here...\" She sends Jingyi one last glare before pulling a bag of fruit out of her large purse and thrusting it into Sizhui's arms. \"Here are some clementines. They're really sweet. You boys share this.\"\n\"Mom, we don't want-\"\n\"Eat it or I'm flushing your game down the toilet!\"\nJingyi grabs the bag from Sizhui. \"I'll eat it!\"\nHis mom narrows her eyes for a moment. \"Share with Sizhui and Young Master Jin. Anyways, message me if you need to come home. Your father is off playing mahjong again and I don't know when I'll be back. Han Guang-Jun, don't hesitate to send him home if he causes any more trouble for you!\"\nLan Wangji, who has stayed blissfully silent the entire time, gives her a nod. Still, the ends of his lips are pulled up by a fraction, and he clearly finds this whole exchange entertaining. Jingyi really can't get a break.\nThankfully, his mom takes her leave, but not before giving Jingyi one last warning. The door is barely closed when Jingyi collapses dramatically on the couch.\n\"Sorry.\" Sizhui pats him sympathetically on the arm.\n\"Why are you sorry?\" Jingyi wants to know. Still, he feels the need to apologize to Lan Wangji for the disturbance.\nSizhui's father just hums. \"No need.\"\n\"Eh,\" Jin Ling says, taking a seat next to Jingyi. \"Was that the game you were gonna play?\"\nJingyi nods pitifully.\n\"So what will you do now?\"\n\"Eat the fruit, I guess.\"\nLan Wangji sets a serving plate on the table. \"Sizhui, I'm retiring to the study. Take care of your guests.\"\n\"Yes, Father.\" Sizhui is already bringing napkins and cups of water over. He waits until his father rounds the corner before a smile breaks across his face, and Sizhui has to hide his laughter in his hands while Jingyi shoves him.\n\"It's not funny!\" Jingyi cries.\n\"It was pretty funny,\" Jin Ling says.\nJingyi doesn't even have the energy to argue, so he mopes while Sizhui turns on the TV. The three of them move to sit on the now-heated floor, each taking one side of the low table and peeling the clementines.\n\"My mom is always like this,\" Jingyi mumbles, playing with a length of pith. He looks up when Jin Ling deliberately clears his throat. \"What?\"\n\"Can I ask something?\"\n\"You just did.\" Jingyi grins when Jin Ling half glares, half pouts.\nJin Ling turns to Sizhui, looking conflicted. \"Where is your mother? No one has mentioned her, but there's no sign of a memorial alter here...\"\nThis is definitely not what Jingyi expected. In fact, it's been years since Jingyi has heard anyone address the absence of a mother in front of Sizhui, the extended Lan family having instructed their children not to probe.\nSizhui looks surprised too. Eventually, he says, \"My parents passed away in an accident when I was four. I was adopted.\"\n\"Oh,\" Jin Ling says quietly. \"...Sorry\"\n\"There's no need for you for be sorry,\" Sizhui reassures him, but Jin Ling just looks even more upset for bringing the topic up.\nJingyi, of course, already knows all this. He'd known about Sizhui's situation ever since they were eight and he'd gotten them both in trouble for scattering a box of legos. That night, Jingyi's mother had responded to Jingyi's declaration of Sizhui is my new best friend with the warning he must never pry into Sizhui's past. Still, Sizhui was the one who told him everything, his voice unnaturally even and calm for a child as they tried to hide evidence of the lego spill in a vase.\nAll three of them are quiet for a moment before Jin Ling puts a neatly peeled clementine in front of Sizhui. It's a cute gesture of apology, and Sizhui accepts gratefully. \"Actually,\" Sizhui says. \"Your uncle was my doctor. It's thanks to him I'm still alive.\"\nThis, Jingyi didn't know. He turns to Sizhui, but finds that he doesn't know what to say for once.\n\"It's not thanks to him,\" Jin Ling speaks up after a while.\nSizhui blinks. \"Pardon?\"\n\"Patients send Uncle gifts all the time, saying this and that about how he saved their lives, but he says they put too much faith in him and not in themselves. I mean, sure, he's a doctor. But, Lan Sizhui, you were alive because you had parents, and now you're alive because you have Han Guang-Jun and because of yourself. No one else can make you live the life you want. So, eh, give yourself some credit.\"\nJingyi understands what Jin Ling means, but he's still surprised by his thoughtfulness.\n\"Thank you,\" Sizhui tells Jin Ling again, this time with more feeling.\nJin Ling looks flustered at his own rant, and he goes back to peeling clementines while Fei Cheng Wu Rao plays on the television. They return to bickering when Jingyi starts commentating through the episode, and Jin Ling immediately starts arguing with Jingyi about the male contestants.\nThey spend the rest of the night watching reruns until Jin Ling yawns very obviously, and Sizhui insists Jin Ling rests. It's already midnight when Jingyi finishes washing up and climbs into the guest room bed, where Sizhui is scrolling through his phone.\n\"Hey,\" Jingyi says when Sizhui sets his phone down. \"Jin Ling is right, you know.\"\n\"About what?\"\n\"You don't owe Han Guang-Jun everything. He raised you because he wanted to, not because he wanted you to be indebted to him.\"\nSizhui looks down at the frayed ends of his old t-shirt. \"I know, but I feel like I do.\"\nJingyi kind of wants to shake Sizhui, but he settles on poking him in the shoulder. \"Everyone feels grateful for their parents, but you have this, like, extra sense of guilt. I mean, do you think you ruined Han Guang-Jun's life or something? It's not like he chooses not to get married because of you. I'm pretty sure you add value to his life, not the other way around!\"\nWhen Sizhui doesn't respond, a thought occurs to Jingyi. \"Is that why you're been so mopey lately?\"\n\"Jingyi,\" Sizhui says instead, grabbing Jingyi's finger until they're holding hands. \"Thank you.\"\n\"Hn! See, I do have good ideas. I don't want to hear anyone else say you're the brains and I'm the brawn.\"\nThis makes Sizhui laugh. \"No one has ever said that!\"\n\"That\u2019s what you think,\" Jingyi says, hiding his grin by turning around. \"Let's go to sleep!\"\nIn the morning, Sizhui wakes both Jingyi and Jin Ling up with the promise of food. They enter the dining room to find Lan Wangji sitting at the table with freshly made congee and a variety of pickled dishes. \"Father made this,\" Sizhui says while setting the table. \"Come eat while it's still warm.\"\nWhile Jin Ling runs a finger through his horrible bedhead , Jingyi digs in, heedless of his own morning hair. They eat in comfortable silence until Lan Wangji declares that he has business to take care of today.\n\"Sizhui, take your friends out for dinner.\" He leaves cash on the table before heading out for the day, his white coat looking immaculate.\n\"What should we do now?\" Jin Ling asks after breakfast, when Sizhui is washing the dishes.\nWith Jingyi's original plan of playing Monster Hunter all weekend ruined, they take a moment to come up with a new itinerary. After the dishes are done, they dress for a day outing and take Jin Ling to the nearby park where more than one person lets Jin Ling pet their dog. In the afternoon, Sizhui leads them to his favorite musical instruments store, where Sizhui purchases new guqin strings while Jingyi pokes around. They have shaved ice at a local shop, the three of them sharing flavors after Jingyi demands to try Jin Ling's. After that, they wander back to Sizhui's house and spend the afternoon marathoning the 1995 version of The Chinese Odyssey.\nIt's nice, really, to have a quiet day away from school. At Jingyi's insistence, they order KFC for dinner. All three of them stay up way too late watching some Hollywood series with bad dubs. Eventually, they give up and switch to the original audio, Jingyi dubbing over dialogue with incorrect translations until Jin Ling throws a pillow at him.\nWhen Sizhui suggests Jin Ling retires for bed, Jin Ling frowns. \"I'm not a child! I can stay here with you guys.\"\n\"If you're not sleeping in Sizhui's bed, then I am!\" Jingyi jokes, only for Jin Ling to tug him back. They somehow start wrestling, which ends with Jingyi holding Jin Ling in a headlock and Sizhui trying to separate them.\nJingyi honestly doesn't remember how they all fell asleep in the guest room, but he's rudely awoken in the morning to a sore back and the sound of laughter. He glances up and realizes that (1) he'd fallen off the bed during the night and (2) Jin Ling's uncle is now standing at the door way, next to Lan Wangji.\n\"Looks like you kids had too much fun,\" Wei Wuxian says, no doubt having been let in by Sizhui\u2019s father when he came to fetch Jin Ling. \"Having fun, A-Ling?\"\n\"Ack!\" Jin Ling shouts, shooting up in the bed and knocking his head into Sizhui's shoulder. \"Get out!\"\nThis just sends Wei Wuxian into another fit of laughter. \"And to think I woke up early just to come pick you up. Lan Zhan, let's wait elsewhere. \"\nLan Wangji levels all three of them with a firm look before turning to Wei Wuxian. \"I have tea.\"\n\"I would love to have tea with you while my silly nephew gets ready,\" Wei Wuxian says. He gives Jin Ling a wink before following Lan Wangji.\n\"I can't believe we overslept so much.\" Jingyi checks his phone to find it out of battery. He lies back on the ground as Jin Ling jumps down from the bed, stepping around Jingyi as he runs back into Sizhui's room. Sizhui follows Jin Ling out, but instead of heading towards his room, he tiptoes through the hallway. Jingyi, for lack of anything else to do, follows.\nThey're both in the hallway, out of sight, when Wei Wuxian's voice carries over.\n\"Lan Zhan! I didn't know you had this tea! It's my favorite! None of the stores in Shanghai carry it. Where did you get this?\"\nSilence, followed by, \"It was a gift.\"\n\"Always so verbose, huh? Did Ling-zi behave while he was here?\"\n\"He was fine. I was out most of the day.\"\nA gasp. \"Lan Zhan! You gotta keep an eye on my little dumpling! Who knows what kind of trouble they can get up to!\"\n\"Sizhui has never misbehaved.\"\n\"Wow, so much faith in A-Yuan! You never afforded me the same courtesy when we were in school! Remember how you always caught me when I was out of the dorms past curfew? I swore you were following me! And then you got us both in trouble!\"\nA-Yuan? Trouble? Jingyi can't imagine their Han Guang-Jun breaking any of the rules at Cloud Recesses, much less spend time with someone as loud as Jin Ling's uncle. A quick glance at Sizhui confirms that he's thinking the same.\nAfter a moment, when it becomes obvious Lan Wangji doesn't plan on responding, Wei Wuxian speaks again. \"Can you give me a tour?\"\n\"Fine.\"\nJingyi and Sizhui immediately duck into the bathroom. They can hear Wei Wuxian's continuous, one-sided chatter as Lan Wangji shows him the living area, the music room, and finally the study. It's not until the door to the study is mostly closed that Jingyi and Sizhui emerge from the bathroom, both of them quietly making their way through the hallway again.\n\"Wow. This place looks almost exactly like the historical fiction section of the library!\"\n\"Hn.\"\nWei Wuxian laughs. \"It brings back memories, mostly bad ones. Remember how we were stuck in the library for a month?\"\n\"... Was it bad for you?\"\n\"Well, not all bad. Copying the rules sucked, but you were fun to tease, Lan Zhan!\"\nWho in the world dared to tease Lan Wangji? Jingyi's head is swimming with questions when he hears the soft padding of feet behind him. He turns around to find Jin Ling standing in the hallway, looking at the two of them strangely.\n\"What are-\"\nSizhui immediately shushes him with a finger on his mouth. To his credit, Jin Ling doesn't protest much and just looks at them like they're crazy.\n\"That's nice,\" Wei Wuxian's voice carries out once again. He seems to be picking up something, and Jingyi cranes his neck enough to see their backs as Wei Wuxian holds a picture frame in his hands. \"I didn't know you were the type to press flowers, Lan Zhan.\"\nNo response.\n\"Come to think of it, this reminds me of the ones outside of the library pavillion. Do you remember them?\"\n\"Hn.\"\nWei Wuxian is right. Cloud Recesses still maintains a healthy patch of flowers outside of the library, carefully tended to by the gardener.\n\"Do you remember when I stuck those flowers in your hair?\" Wei Wuxian is laughing now, obviously recalling a fond memory. \"I took a photo as evidence to show the others, but we ended up fighting over my disposable camera and breaking it! No one believed me when I said you broke it!\"\nSizhui seems to be overwhelmed by the image of flowers in his father's hair, because he covers his mouth entirely to prevent any sounds from escaping. Jingyi thinks this must be a joke, but even Jin Ling is silently mouthing what the fuck. Jin Ling presses further and further to get a good look, practically using Jingyi's back as an armrest.\n\"After all,\" Wei Wuxian continues. \"No one else got a glimpse of your cute angry face, Lan Er Gege!\"\nJingyi chokes on thin air at the sound of such a shameless pet name. He goes down with a cough, lungs hacking as Jin Ling also loses his balance on top of him. Sizhui tries to help, but the three of them end up collapsed on top of each other with a loud thud, Jingyi gasping for air as he rolls out from underneath Jin Ling.\n\"See?\" Wei Wuxian says when he's standing in the doorway with Lan Wangji. \"I told you to keep an eye on them.\"\nJin Ling stands up and brushes nonexistent dust off him. \"I'm ready to go,\" he declares as if he wasn't just caught eavesdropping.\n\"I bet you are,\" Wei Wuxian says, setting a hand in Jin Ling's hair which he abruptly bats away. When Jingyi snickers, Wei Wuxian gives him a knowing smile. \"Lan Zhan, we've taken up enough of your time. Plus, Jiang Cheng will be mad if we're show up any later. Come on, Ling-zi.\"\n\"Don't call me that,\" Jin Ling mumbles, but follows Wei Wuxian towards the door anyway with his suitcase. He dwindles a bit longer when Sizhui\u2019s father goes to see him off, both Jin Ling and Wei Wuxian thanking him for the hospitality.\nJingyi stays painstakingly silent until the door is closed and Lan Wangji has retreated to his study. He then turns to Sizhui. \"What the heck is going on?!\"\nOn Wednesday, Sizhui is roughly tugged by the arm from his evening student council session and shoved into Jin Ling's room for the inaugural meeting of Operation: Old Men.\nAll Sizhui can think about, besides the sheer size of the private suite, is how Jin Ling was right about Jingyi having unnatural arm strength. Sizhui is still rubbing absently at his forearm when Jingyi forces him to sit on the couch, next to a large stuffed husky plush. \"That's cute,\" Sizhui says for lack of anything else.\nJin Ling grabs the plush immediately and throws it into his bedroom, face red. He then clears his throat. \"Lan Jingyi and I have been talking-\"\n\"Planning,\" Jingyi cuts in.\n\"Strategizing,\" Jin Lin corrects. \"We think something is going on with my uncle and your dad.\"\nAh. Sizhui hadn't expected this type of response, especially after Jingyi's incredulous reaction and Jin Ling's tight-lipped behavior since they all returned to Cloud Recesses that Sunday. Sizhui had thought that he had read too much into Wei Wuxian's interactions with his father or was simply imagining things. \"I see.\"\nJingyi flops down the couch and spreads his legs. The white blazer of his uniform jacket is already gone, and his blue tie is now crooked. Sizhui resists the urge to straighten it for him. \"No, seriously! Something is going on!\" Jingyi says.\n\"No, I meant-I see it too,\" Sizhui says. \"But, I'm not quite sure what it is, and Father doesn't like to talk about his feelings.\"\nJin Ling responds by crossing his arms and huffing, \"Well! I did some digging and contacted my sources. Look!\" He pulls out his phone and opens up his WeChat history.\n\u00a0\n3:04 PM\nJin Ling: dad\nJin Ling: DAD\n6:34 PM\nJin Ling: DAD !!!\n\u91d1\u5b50\u8f69: What is it, A-Ling?\n\u91d1\u5b50\u8f69: You know I'm busy at work\n\u91d1\u5b50\u8f69: Do you need me to transfer more money into your account at school? Do you need something?\nJin Ling: what?\nJin Ling: no\nJin Ling: do you know what's going with dajiu and han guang-jun?\n\u91d1\u5b50\u8f69: ?\n\u91d1\u5b50\u8f69: Lan Wangji?\n\u91d1\u5b50\u8f69: Did Wei Wuxian do something to offend him again?\nJin Ling: what?\n\u91d1\u5b50\u8f69: I don't know. Ask your mother.\n\u00a0\n\"Wow,\" Jingyi mutters. \"All fathers are the same, huh? What did your mother say?\"\n\u00a0\n7:02 PM\nJin Ling: mom do you know what's going on with dajiu and han guang-jun\n\u6c5f\u71d5\u5b50: A-Ling! Did you eat dinner? ^^\nJin Ling: i ate already\n\u6c5f\u71d5\u5b50: Okay! Don't skip your meals! Let myself or your father know if you need more money on your dining card!\n\u6c5f\u71d5\u5b50: The twins have been so picky lately. They won't eat anything too salty or too bitter.\n\u6c5f\u71d5\u5b50: Oh, Tiantian wants to talk to you\n\u6c5f\u71d5\u5b50: [AUDIO]\nJin Ling: yeah, tell her i miss her too\nJin Ling: i don't need more money\nJin Ling: anyways do you know anything about what i asked?\n\u6c5f\u71d5\u5b50: About A-Xian? Why don't you just ask him?\nJin Ling: he never gives me straight answers!\n\u6c5f\u71d5\u5b50: [Confused Cat Sticker]\nJin Ling: mom im serious! do you know anything?\n\u6c5f\u71d5\u5b50: Well, your Daijiu and Han Guang-Jun have been rivals since their school days. They have a very interesting friendship. That's all I know for sure ^^\nJin Ling: mom what does that mean?\n8:01PM\nJin Ling: mom????\nJin Ling: [Sad Cat Sticker]\n\u6c5f\u71d5\u5b50 Sorry, A-Ling. The twins wanted me to read to them before bed. Why don't you ask A-Xian if you have questions?\n\u00a0\n\"Nice stickers,\" Jingyi says, which makes Jin Ling punch him in the arm. Jingyi doesn't even wince at the force of it.\nSizhui rereads the messages. \"Do you think your mother is hiding something?\"\n\"She's not the type to give me answers easily,\" Jin Ling mumbles. \"That's why I hate asking her for help on my homework... She always makes me think.\"\nJingyi tugs the phone out of Sizhui's hands and scrolls up. \"So is that it?\"\n\"Keep reading!\"\n\u00a0\n11:25 PM\nJin Ling: shushu can i ask you something?\nMeng Yao: A-Ling? Do you need something?\nJin Ling: do you know han guang-jun?\nMeng Yao: Lan Wangji? I am acquainted with his brother\nJin Ling: ok that's a stupid question\nJin Ling: you know everyone\nMeng Yao: What did you want to ask?\nJin Ling: you know my dajiu right?\nMeng Yao: Dr. Wei?\nJin Ling: yeah do you know if there's something going on between him and han guang-jun?\nMeng Yao: Your father is the one who went to school with them. Wouldn't it be better if you asked him?\nJin Ling: urg\nJin Ling: nevermind\nMeng Yao: You should go to sleep soon. Staying up late is bad for you.\nJin Ling: shushu!!!\nMeng Yao: The early bird gets the worm. Good night!\n\u00a0\n\"No luck either, huh?\" Jingyi clicks on the button that takes them back to the main chat screen. A new message is highlighted, and Jingyi opens it after receiving a nod of approval from Jin Ling. \"Is this your cousin or something? An aunt?\"\n\"That's my xiaoshu! That's just what he looks like!\"\nSizhui peers over Jingyi's shoulder. Jin Ling's father and shushu had used generic headshots while his mother had a photo of a swallow in her profile picture. This new user, however, had a very androgynous looking profile photo of someone wearing faint red makeup.\n\"How many uncles do you even have?\" Jingyi demands. He doesn't complain when Sizhui takes the phone from him.\n\u00a0\n7:20 AM\nJin Ling: xiaoshu pls tell me you know something\nJin Ling: what the heck is going on with dajiu and han guang-jun???\nMo XY: Good morning, A-Ling!\nJin Ling: come on you are my last hope\nJin Ling: i know you know some gossip\nJin Ling: or something!\nMo XY: Han Guang-Jun as in Lan Wangji?\nMo XY: I know he's... Very handsome?\nMo XY: Oh. His baidu profile photo is very...\nJin Ling: stop checking him out! so do you know him or what?\nMo XY: I think Huaisang went to school with him\nJin Ling: can you ask him\nJin Ling: ask him if he knows my dajiu too\nMo XY: I will~\n3:12 PM\nMo XY: Are you sure you want to know?\nJin Ling: tell me!!!\nMo XY: Huaisang said he sold Wei Wuxian some porn magazines and Wei Wuxian snuck them into Lan Wangji's desk. They both got in trouble and served a month of detention together.\nJin Ling: what\nMo XY: Huaisang also said he was one of the founders of the Cloud Recesses student newspaper but he used it as a front to smuggle goods in school\nMo XY: Actually, I shouldn't be telling you this\nJin Ling: xiaoshu don\u2019t be like this!\nMo XY: I'm gotta go! Talk to you later~!\n\u00a0\n\"Huh.\" Jingyi rubs his chin thoughtfully. \"Fascinating.\"\nJin Ling sighs. \"There's one more person.\"\n\u00a0\n11:30 AM\nJin Ling: what happened between dajiu and han guang-jun??\nJiang Cheng: I don't know and I don't care\n\u00a0\nJingyi is quiet for a moment before speaking up, \"Your sources are just your family members?\"\n\"At least I didn't ask my sisters!\"\n\"Your sisters are babies!\"\n\"You're a baby!\"\nSizhui cuts in then, putting his hands up. \"Can we please focus? I think Jin Ling's family confirmed that there was some history between them, although they didn't provide details.\"\nThis makes Jingyi snort. \"You're all amateurs! While Little Mistress J-\"\n\"You wanna die?!\"\n\"While Little Mistress Jin was busy chatting up his three hundred uncles, I did some actual investigative work!\" He pulls a stack of newspapers out of his bookbag. \"Jin Ling said Wei Wuxian was only in school for a year, right? So I went to the library and pulled all the publications from the student newspaper from the year he was here.\"\nJin Ling stops frowning and begins flipping through the stack. \"What did you find?\"\n\"Officially? Nothing much. Just an article from that archery competition.\" He shows them a darker, aged copy of the competition photo they'd seen at Sizhui's house. \"Remember what your xiaoshu said about the newspaper? I thought it was weird that the newspaper kept printing ads for very specific things like a bundle of pencils and a pack of coke flavored popsicles.\"\nThe issue Jingyi shows them has a sidebar on page 3. It's a fairly normal looking ad about a student looking to sell his calculator. However, the descriptions are weirdly specific and littered with strange word choices. Sizhui pauses. \"Are you saying this was code for the smuggling ring?\"\nJingyi shrugs and extracts another issue from the top of the pile. \"Who knows? But look at this! Usually the ads are people looking to sell or buy physical objects, but this one is from someone name Mianmian advertising her group!\"\n\"Year long study group for Human Psychology class. Meet at Phoenix Mountain?\" Jin Ling reads from the page. \"What the heck is Phoenix Mountain? And there's no such thing as a psychology class here, is it?\"\nThere's something very off about the snippet, Sizhui agrees. He thinks for a moment. \"Is Phoenix Mountain a real landmark?\u201d\nSome shuffling ensues as Jingyi procures his phone. \"I wondered about that too! So I looked up \u2018Phoenix Mountain' and you're not gonna believe what I found! I mean, besides nature photography! Guess!\"\n\"Just tell us!\" Jin Ling snaps.\n\"Fine! What I found was a locked Baidu Tieba full of Cloud Recesses gossip! I have no clue who's managing it but it's still active! There's even a whole thread about people wanting to date Sizhui which I... Eh. Totally didn't read or anything!\"\nSizhui can feel his face heat up. \"Jingyi!\"\n\"Anyways! I had to beg A-Qing from Class 3-C for the password. She is not easy to please, let's just say that. Anyways, I was up late looking through the archive threads. A lot of them have been deleted or closed, but there were a few from the year Wei Wuxian was in school. The only problem is that everyone used codenames to chat.\"\nWhen Jin Ling goes to load the tieba page on his desktop with the large monitor, Sizhui turns to Jingyi. \"Good work.\"\n\"Yeah?\" Jingyi grins. He has always been selectively attentive, but even Sizhui is impressed by this turn of events. \"You can call me Detective Lan. Maybe I should open my own investigative agency.\"\n\"Maybe you just watched too many episodes of Detective Conan,\" Jin Ling says. He gestures for the other boys to huddle around him before scrolling down the touchscreen monitor. \"Urg. These usernames are so annoying. Who the heck is Blind4Love04?\"\nJingyi bats Jin Ling's arm away until he's in charge of navigating. \"Look at this thread from 18 years ago!\" He points to Xianxian and 2Jade.\nBoth Sizhui's father and uncle have been hailed as traditionally handsome by the media, to the point where they were often referred to as the \"Twin Jades\" of the Lan family. Sizhui had no clue this nickname originated more than two decades ago. Regardless, there's no doubt in Sizhui's mind that \"2Jade\" is a codename for his father. A quick glance at Jin Ling's annoyed expression confirms that \"Xianxian\" must refer to Wei Wuxian.\n\"Well?\" Jin Ling asks. \"What are you waiting for?

So far, they\u2019ve only covered perhaps one-third of a page, yet he can\u2019t force himself to look away. \u201cHow many more pages are left in this thread?\u201d\nJingyi scrolls to the bottom and turns to Sizhui with grave eyes. \u201cEighty-nine.\u201d\nIn their defense, Jin Ling and Jingyi manage to go through twenty pages before giving up, decidedly after Jingyi is forced to recite an anonymous user\u2019s recollection of how he spotted Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian fighting and/or flirting in the men\u2019s shower area. Sizhui is starting to wonder if this is all an elaborate hoax when Jin Ling says, \u201cSome of these stories are suspiciously believable.\u201d\nThey decide to resume at a later date, Jingy making a pained noise when Sizhui reminds him of their history homework. \u201cWhat a gold mine of quality content,\u201d Jingyi says as they walk back to the other side of the dorms, where Jingyi and Sizhui occupy rooms across the hall from each other. \u201cWho knew Han Guang-Jun had such an exciting school life? And a potential love interest dating back a decade?\u201d\nSizhui considers this. His father has never shown any interest in offers from matchmakers. He was ruthless at navigating even the most subtle of romantic set ups, preferring to stare mirthlessly until the other party beat a hasty retreat. For the longest time, Sizhui wondered if his father was even capable of harboring romantic feelings for anyone. Then Wei Wuxian appeared like a storm in Sizhui\u2019s home, leaving traces of his laughter echoing in every corner and drawing genuine emotions from his father.\nThe truth is Sizhui doesn\u2019t know what to do with all this information. He fears that they\u2019re overstepping or overreacting, or perhaps both. Some part of him feels ashamed for peeping into such a private part of his father\u2019s past. The main branch of the Lan family have always found themselves in the media spotlight, despite their private nature. It\u2019s something Sizhui\u2019s father and uncle have always ignored, preferring to redirect the focus on their work rather than their personal lives.\nJingyi seems to be aware of Sizhui\u2019s internal conflict, because he slaps Sizhui on the back to knock him out of his reverie. \u201cStop spacing out! You still gotta help me with homework!\u201d\nUnfortunately, Sizhui\u2019s habit of over analyzing everything can\u2019t be solved with Jingyi\u2019s constant prodding. He thinks about the tieba at night, in the mornings, during class, and in the spaces in between until he\u2019s so distracted that a rabbit nips on his finger for attention. \u201cOuch,\u201d Sizhui says absently, looking down at the fluffy friend in his lap. Next to him, Jingyi very obviously snickers.\n\u201cServes you right,\u201d Jin Ling says, sitting an arms length away from him in the garden. He\u2019s feeding a spotted rabbit with a small piece of celery. \u201cStop zoning out so much! If you\u2019re so concerned, why don\u2019t you just ask Han Guang-Jun? Go home this weekend and confront him face to face, like a real man!\u201d\n\u201cLike you\u2019re not invested too!\u201d Jingyi laughs. \u201cWho\u2019s the one that stayed up til 2am reading about their uncle\u2019s love life? Why don\u2019t you ask him face to face?\u201d\nJin Ling turns his head away. \u201cHn! I was just curious! And I would, but he\u2019s busy this weekend! The Pediatrics Cardiac Association is holding a gala and he was invited to attend!\u201d Regardless, Jin Ling sounds quite proud of this.\n\u201cFather is attending that gala too,\u201d Sizhui says, remembering the quick conversation they had last weekend. \u201cMy family has been a donor for years. Uncle is usually the one who handles social outings, but he\u2019s still in Beijing for work so Father will be going in his place. Actually, my cousin will probably be there as well.\u201d\nJingyi looks up from setting a rabbit on his own face. He\u2019s lying with his back on the grass and two other rabbits seated comfortably on his stomach. \u201cCan you ask your cousin to spy for us?\u201d\nThe idea of Wen Qing spying on Wei Wuxian is laughable at best. Sizhui scratches his cheek. \u201cProbably not. She\u2019s pretty busy, and I think she may be accepting an award there?\u201d\n\u201cFancy,\u201d Jingyi hums. He nudges Jin Ling with his knee. \u201cWhy are you so quiet?\u201d\nJin Ling doesn\u2019t stop from furiously typing on his phone. \u201cEvents like that are half for charity and half for publicity, right? My parents attend them all the time and there\u2019s always media coverage.\u201d\nThis is something Sizhui hadn\u2019t considered. He\u2019s been taught from a young age to ignore agencies that publish stories about the Lan family. \u201cAre you suggesting we\u2026 Look to the tabloids for updates?\u201d\n\u201cNo! What I\u2019m saying is these type of galas also invite rich people who are likely to donate. Rich people like to flaunt their social lives, so it\u2019s not a bad idea to keep track of their accounts.\u201d Jin Ling gracefully ignores Jingyi\u2019s comment of like you\u2019re not a rich person too and pulls up someone\u2019s weibo page. The display photo is of a Tang dynasty hand fan. \u201cXiaoshu\u2019s friend, this Nie Huaisang guy, is the biggest gossip around. My dad is always telling me not to say too much around him.\u201d\nSure enough, the latest update on the page shows Nie Huaisang is already in Shanghai, two days ahead of the event. His page is filled with curated photos of food and scenery, interrupted by occasional photos of himself. He reminds Sizhui of the socialites who often approach his uncle at events.\n\u201cThis guy went to school with Han Guang-Jun and Wei Wuxian too, right?\u201d Jingyi points out. \u201cWe should ask around to see if anyone else\u2019s family member is going to that event. Then we can keep track in case they update.\u201d\n\u201cSo we\u2019re going to\u2026 Stalk people on the internet?\u201d Sizhui frowns.\nJingyi just grins. \u201cI prefer to call it \u2018Social Research.\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy Saturday evening, Sizhui is seriously regretting his decision to bring Jingyi and Jin Ling into the fold. Still, he dutifully finishes this week\u2019s assignments before making his way to Jin Ling\u2019s suite, where Jingyi and Jin Ling are already camped out. Jingyi sits with the KFC Family bucket he\u2019d especially ordered for the event, using a drumstick to point at the monitor that Jin Ling is setting up.\n\u201cDo you think maybe we\u2019re\u2026 Making this a bigger deal than it is?\u201d Sizhui suggests.\nThe drumstick is pointed at Sizhui warningly. \u201cNothing is bigger than matters of the heart! Plus, I like looking at photos of rich people! That\u2019s why I like our Little Mistress so much.\u201d\n\u201cI hope you choke on that chicken,\u201d Jin Ling tells him seriously. He refreshes the article currently on screen. \u201cLooks like there\u2019s even a red carpet. People are already showing up.\u201d\nIf anything, Sizhui agrees with Jingyi\u2019s sentiment. Following socialites is truly a spectator sport that he'd never given himself the luxury to indulge in. Sizhui takes a seat and accepts Jingyi\u2019s offer of food as the page refreshes on a familiar face.\nOn screen, Wen Qing looks completely unamused as she\u2019s forced to pose in front of a wall full of sponsors\u2019 logos. She\u2019s clad in a red dress with a white blazer hanging on her shoulders while glaring into the camera. The caption on the photo states Wen Qing of Shanghai Children\u2019s Hospital Cardiac Ward Arrives In Unbranded Dress. Dr. Wen will be receiving an award tonight on her research and work in the field..\n\u201cThat\u2019s your cousin?\u201d Jingyi asks, gulping down a bottle of sprite. \u201cI don\u2019t see the resemblance!\u201d\nSizhui takes a bite of a biscuit, using a bowl to hold his crumbs. He\u2019d spotted a roomba previously in Jin Ling\u2019s room, but Sizhui still tries his best not to make a mess. \u201cShe\u2019s not really my cousin. We\u2019re distantly related but, she\u2019s still the closest thing I can call an older sister.\u201d He privately thinks about how Wen Qing had looked offended the one time he called her \u201cAunt,\u201d but chooses not to share that.\n\u201cLook who else updated.\u201d Jin Ling hands over his tablet which displays Nie Huaisang\u2019s weibo page. There\u2019s a new post from five minutes ago with photos of the venue interior. The ballroom is not so much of a surprise as the photo that follows.\nThe picture is slightly blurry, but Wen Ning looks happy to be posing in a selfie with Nie Huaisang. \u201cHe really does know everyone, huh?\u201d Sizhui says to no one in particular.\nUnfortunately, that weibo post is the only thing relevant to their interests. Even with their combined efforts in social research (three cell phones, one desktop, and one tablet) all they manage to find are photos of strangers and detailed pictures of the bathroom mirror where everyone is taking full body shots of their outfits. Jin Ling claims to have spotted his uncle in the background of one photo, but zooming in confirms it\u2019s just someone else in a black suit.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d Sizhui says after a while, when Jingyi is very obviously playing a puzzle game on his phone instead of researching. \u201cEverything we\u2019ve read so far on the tieba has been from years ago. Maybe it\u2019s true that there was something going on between Dr. Wei and Father, but it\u2019s been so long. How do we even know if there are any feelings left?\u201d\nJingyi looks up and turns to Jin Ling. \u201cWell? Has your uncle brought dates home before?\u201d\n\u201cHell no.\u201d Jin Ling pulls his legs into a butterfly pose. \u201cEveryone in my family knows that you don\u2019t bring anyone home unless they\u2019re marriage material, or else Grandma would tear them apart. Dajiu would sometimes make comments about certain people being attractive, but I\u2019ve never seen him date anyone.\u201d\n\u201cOr maybe he just never introduced you to any of his dates,\u201d Jingyi suggests.\n\u201cFine, that too.\u201d\nSizhui turns the idea over in his head. Homosexuality has never been a topic of conversation in his family, but then again, neither was love in general. In fact, it seems like most of the adults in Sizhui\u2019s life chose their career over conventional expectations of a nuclear family. \u201cHow do we even know he likes men?\u201d\nJin Ling shrugs. \u201cHow do you know if Han Guang-Jun likes men?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Sizhui says at last.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re back to square one,\u201d Jingyi mumbles. He resumes playing the puzzle game, which devolves when Jin Ling begins giving him strategy advice that ends with the two of them arguing. Their bickering leaves Sizhui alone with his own thoughts again, and he\u2019s about to suggest they wrap up for the night when another weibo update pops up on the tablet.\nNie Huaisang\u2019s newest post is another collection of selfies. This time, it includes a blurry shot with Wei Wuxian, who laughs while holding a jar of liquor that he appears to have snatched from one of the catering tables. In fact, Wei Wuxian seems to be constantly photobombing every photo until the last one.\nSizhui nearly drops the tablet.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jin Ling demands, coming over. He takes a moment to squint at the screen before making a disgusted face. \u201cWell, this answers your question of whether they\u2019re still interested in each other.\u201d\nThe very last photo is a blurry portrait shot of Wei Wuxian caught mid laughter. He looks delighted in his black suit and very much like a young bachelor. Right next to him, however, is a figure clad in white. They\u2019re attached by the hands, where the person in white is tugging at Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrists and leaning in to whisper something into his ear. The fall of his hair, coupled with the strange angle, hides most of his face, but Sizhui knows without a doubt that the second person is his father.\n\u201cHow incriminating.\u201d Jingyi whistles.\nSizhui can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s seeing. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s too loud inside and he needed\u2026 To speak to Dr. Wei privately?\u201d\n\u201cUn-huh.\u201d Jingyi scoots over towards Jin Ling, pulls him in by the arm, and is about to plant a fat kiss when Jin Ling starts hollering and pushes Jingyi away.\n\u201cWHat-WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU\u2019RE DOING?!\u201d Jin Ling shouts, covering the side of his cheek that Jingyi barely even touched. \u201cHow dare you-you-you-\u201d\nJingyi shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m demonstrating that normal people don\u2019t do stuff like this.\u201d\nSizhui knows that Jingyi is right. There\u2019s really no logical, innocent explanation for this. His father is not big on skinship to begin with. That singular photograph is so damning that they may as well quit gathering evidence.\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Jin Lin asks, having finally stopped stuttering and glaring at Jingyi. \u201cThe article is no longer being updated either.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s put that monitor of yours to good use, then,\u201d Jingyi says. He takes a step forward and bursts out laughing when Jin Ling stumbles back. \u201cRelax! Did you think I\u2019d actually kiss you? Get in line!\u201d\n\u201cThere is no line!\u201d Jin Ling all but shrieks. \u201cAnd what do you propose we do?!\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s watch a movie!\u201d\nIn the end, they decide to stream Lost in Thailand. It\u2019s the fourth time Sizhui has seen this movie, so he allows himself to zone out while periodically refreshing Nie Huaisang\u2019s weibo. When he doesn\u2019t find any relevant updates, Sizhui sets his head on Jingyi\u2019s shoulder. Jingyi, used to Sizhui\u2019s moods, just absently pats Sizhui\u2019s head a few times. The movie is funny enough, and soon Jin Ling and Jingyi are both laughing. Sizhui feels himself shake with laughter too, his arm pressed against Jingyi\u2019s.\nThe next thing Sizhui knows, a strip of harsh sunlight from the window is landing directly on his face. It\u2019s morning and Sizhui barely remembers his late night decision to stay here instead of walking back to his room. Thankfully, he\u2019s on the outer edge of the bed, so Sizhui rolls off it silently and turns back to the other occupants.\nJin Ling is still asleep, his body sprawled almost diagonally across the queen size bed. His mouth is open, but no noise escapes it as Jin Ling continues his peaceful slumber. Curled up around Jin Ling\u2019s hip is Jingyi, who has one arm thrown across Jin Ling\u2019s stomach and is using a scrunched up section of the comforter as his pillow.\nA cursory glance at his phone informs Sizhui that it\u2019s 9 am, early enough for the canteen to be open on a Sunday. Sizhui has always kept a regular eating schedule, so he tip toes out of the room in yesterday\u2019s t-shirt and jeans and heads in the direction of food. The dorm is still empty save for the guard on duty, and Sizhui easily makes his way to the canteen with zero distractions. He\u2019s not sure if anyone would even point out his wrinkled t-shirt or bedhead, but he does not encounter any classmates regardless.\nIn the canteen, Sizhui grabs three cups of freshly made soy milk-- no sugar for him and full sugar for Jingyi. He\u2019s not sure what Jin Ling prefers, so he orders medium sugar and a bottle of green tea as well. Sizhui manages to cram six scallion pancakes, ten mini meat buns, a cup of tofu pudding, and an extra large take-out container of century egg porridge in two bags while the aunties on duty chat with him about the weather.\nWalking back to the dorm is balancing act. Thankfully, Sizhui runs into Ouyang Zizhen, who holds the main door open for him while laughing, \u201cAre you trying to feed a village?!\u201d\nIt\u2019s not until Sizhui arrives in Jin Ling\u2019s hallway that he remembers not having a key. Thankfully, Jingyi and Jin Ling are already up, because Sizhui can hear the sound of arguing inside when he knocks.\n\u201cYou\u2019re back!\u201d Jingyi beams when he yanks the door open. He immediately goes to take half of the food from Sizhui\u2019s arms, mumbling something about Jin Ling having bad morning etiquette. \u201cSizhui, can you believe this guy was petting my hair?\u201d Jingyi asks after setting the food on the table.\n\u201cI thought you were my dog!\u201d Jin Ling wails, probably not for the first time. He looks torn between wanting to eat and wanting to tear his own hair out. When Jingyi makes a fake barking sound, Jin Ling throws a stray pillow at him. It misses.\nSizhui laughs and sits down. \u201cLet\u2019s eat before the food gets cold.\u201d\nJingyi thanks Sizhui before digging in. He inhales the scallion pancakes easily and doesn\u2019t wait for a communal spoon before digging into the tofu pudding. Even Jin Ling seems satisfied with his soy milk. They eat in silence until Jingyi says, his mouth still half full, \u201cBy the way, the photo is gone.\u201d\n\u201cWhat photo?\u201d Sizhui asks.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Jin Ling says. \u201cThe incriminating one! That entire post got deleted for some reason. If I hadn\u2019t saved a copy of it, I would\u2019ve thought we dreamed it up!\u201d\nSizhui has no clue what this all means. He can\u2019t even imagine breaching the topic with his father, so Sizhui thumbs through his phone and decides to message the person who is most likely to give him a straight answer.\n9:45AM\nLan Sizhui: Good morning!\nWen Ning: Morning, A-Yuan!\nLan Sizhui: Did you and Wen Qing-Jie have fun last night?\nWen Ning: It was really fancy! Jie acted like she didn\u2019t want to go, but she was quite pleased to receive an award!\nLan Sizhui: Did you happen to see my father there?\n(Wen Ning is typing\u2026)\n\u201cWell?\u201d Jingyi asks, now serving himself porridge.\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk with your mouth full,\u201d Jin Ling reprimands, but makes a pleased noise when Jingyi also puts a serving of porridge in Jin Ling\u2019s bowl.\n\u00a0\nWen Ning: I did speak to Han Guang-Jun, but only brief before he\u2026\nLan Sizhui: What is it?\nLan Sizhui: Is everything okay?\nJingyi is kind enough to also put some porridge into Sizhui\u2019s bowl, and he pushes it towards Sizhui. \u201cStop frowning and eat already!\u201d\nWen Ning: I think Han Guang-Jun had a little too much to drink ^^;;\nWen Ning: He was with Dr. Wei most of the night\nWen Ning: I wasn\u2019t really paying attention to them, sorry!\nThis seems almost impossible to Sizhui, who has never seen his father drink. He\u2019s vaguely aware of the fact that both his father and uncle have low alcohol tolerance, but Sizhui has never witnessed it in action. Yet he\u2019d seen the photo with his own eyes, so there really was no denial that his father had improperly attached himself to Wei Wuxian while drunk.\nLan Sizhui: Thank you for telling me\nLan Sizhui: I\u2019m sorry for the strange question\nWen Ning: A-Yuan\u2026 It\u2019s okay\nWen Ning: Jie and I are used to it ^^;;;;\nUsed to what? To his intrusive questions? Doubtful, since Sizhui tried his best to behave in the Wen siblings\u2019 presence.\nWen Ning: Dr. Wei and Han Guang-Jun have been like this forever\u2026\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Jingyi says, reading over Sizhui\u2019s shoulder. He makes a muffled noise when Jin Ling manually pushes his jaw up. \u201cEveryone! Everyone knows about their sexual tension! Urg! I wish there was something we could do, but we\u2019re stuck at school. We need to be where the action is!\u201d\n\u201cIt does feel like our options are limited,\u201d Sizhui agrees. He takes a few spoonfuls of the porridge and sighs. \u201cI suppose there\u2019s nothing we can do, especially with National Week coming up.\u201d\nJingyi sticks another pancake in his mouth. \u201cWhat are you doing for the week anway? My aunt\u2019s family is going to Taiwan. We were supposed to go too but my mom didn\u2019t get our visas filed on time, so now we\u2019re stuck in Gusu. Lame.\u201d\n\u201cMy cousins are working and Father did not have anything planned,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll spend it in Gusu too.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to Yunmeng,\u201d Jin Ling says when he realizes the other boys are waiting for him to contribute to the conversation. \u201cMy parents and sisters and I are going to visit my mom\u2019s side of the family.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been to Yunmeng. Is it nice?\u201d\nJin Ling puffs his cheeks up like a goldfish. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful there, especially this time of the year! My grandparents own an estate on the water, and there are so many lotus ponds everywhere. It\u2019s actually a huge tourist destination. My sisters love visiting!\u201d\nSizhui can\u2019t help but smile. \u201cYour sisters aren\u2019t the only ones, it seems.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to Yunmeng too?\u201d Jingyi says, apropos to nothing.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jin Ling frowns.\n\u201cWell, Sizhui and I have nothing to do for the week, right? And you said it\u2019s a good vacation spot, right? So let\u2019s go! Plus, Wei Wuxian will be there for the family reunion, so maybe Han Guang-Jun can chaperone us and meet Wei Wuxian there? Then their love can blossom like a lotus in autumn!\u201d\nJin Ling is quiet for a beat before saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not how lotuses work, but okay. I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t come to Lotus Pier. Plenty of tourists do.\u201d\nThis is an unexpected turn of events, and Sizhui tries his best to think of a flaw in their logic. \u201cI\u2019d have to ask my father\u2026 I\u2019m not sure he\u2019d consent to chaperoning us. And what are the chances of us running into Dr. Wei anyway? I don\u2019t want to disrupt Jin Ling\u2019s family.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know my mom would be fine with it if I traveled with you and Han Guang-Jun.\u201d Jingyi shrugs.\n\u201cIf you guys come, I\u2019ll definitely find a way to meet up with you,\u201d Jin Ling promises. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask Han Guang-Jun? What do you have to lose?\u201d\nProbably nothing, Sizhui thinks.\nWhat Sizhui doesn\u2019t realize, days later, is that the universe has a way of both conspiring with and against him. While his father seems indifferent to the idea, it\u2019s Sizhui\u2019s uncle who suggests that the scenery in Yunmeng is admirable this time of the year. He also mentions being invited on an unexpected business trip to Malaysia during National Week, thus absolving them of the potential guilt of leaving Ze Wu-Jun by himself.\nThe second factor is Jin Ling, who casually mentions to his mother that his friends are visiting Lotus Pier. When it comes to light that one of the friends is the child of Han Guang-Jun, who will be traveling with them, the Jiang family decides to extend a personal invitation to their estate.\n\u201cI told them you guys can just book a hotel,\u201d Jin Ling says three days before the start of the holidays. \u201cBut Laolao started yelling at me about how she owns all the hotels in Lotus Pier and that everything has been booked out for the holidays. She says it would personally offend her if you found accommodations elsewhere when there are perfectly good guest rooms at her place.\u201d\nJingyi is counting his fingers. \u201cAren\u2019t your family staying with them too? How many guest rooms do they have?\u201d\nJin Ling looks as if someone has asked a very dumb questions about how many guest rooms the emperor\u2019s palace has. \u201cMore than enough.\u201d\n\u201cHuh.\u201d Jingyi sets a heavy hand on Sizhui\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI guess we\u2019re going to Yunmeng!\u201d\nOn the Friday before National Week, Jingyi dashes out of his last morning class to grab his suitcase from the dorms, where Suzhui and Jin Ling are waiting for him with varying levels of patience. Jingyi commends himself on having the foresight to pack beforehand, even if Sizhui deserves most of the credit for gently needling Jingyi days in advance. Still, most of Jingyi\u2019s travel belongings are safely packed in his luggage, neatness notwithstanding. \u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d Jingyi huffs when he finally joins the other boys.\n\u201cBetter late than never,\u201d Jin Ling mumbles. He looks even more overpacked than usual, clad in a overcoat that screamed I\u2019m rich! \n\u201cFather is waiting for us,\u201d Sizhui adds. He\u2019s too polite to rush them, but Jingyi knows him well enough to understand that\u2019s code for we\u2019re late. \nTogether, the three of them lug their bags to the school gates toward the car Jin Ling had called for them. The ride to Shanghai West Station is long and tedious, and Jingyi recognizes the telltale signs for the great National Week migration as the roads are clogged even more so than normal. Thankfully, they arrive in time to go through baggage check and meet Lan Wangji at the gate.\n\u201cSorry for our lateness.\u201d Sizhui takes a seat next to Lan Wangji. He pauses at the stacked items next to them. \u201cFather, what are these?\u201d\n\u201cGifts for the hosts,\u201d Lan Wangji replies. His gaze lands on the box of sweets in Sizhui\u2019s hands. \u201cI see you brought some as well.\u201d\n\u201cJin Ling is the one who suggested it.\u201d \nSizhui leaves out the fact that Jingyi and Sizhui were the ones who had lined up for over an hour at the local traditional dessert shop while Jin Ling was busy at archery practice. In his defense, Jingyi had kept his mouth shut while the girl at the counter made heart eyes at Sizhui as she wrapped up their box. \n\u201cMy grandmother has very selective taste,\u201d Jin Ling says, as if he hadn\u2019t warned them a dozen times of his grandmother\u2019s strictness. In no uncertain terms had Jin Ling told Jingyi to be on his best behavior. At this point, Jingyi fully expects to be meeting Empress Dowager Cixi at Lotus Pier. \nEven worse than the repeated prodding had been Jin Ling\u2019s family tree, which he presented to Jingyi and Sizhui in the form of a powerpoint. Jin Ling had stressed the importance of memorizing his family members, lest they misstep and embarrass Jin Ling. Jingyi was pretty sure Jin Ling just recycled his family tree presentation from English class. Either way, his head was so filled to the brim with useless information about the Jin-Jiang family that Jingyi had accidentally written Jin Ling\u2019s name by accident on his history quiz. \nJingyi wonders if Jin Ling sent Lan Wangji the same slideshow. Probably not, considering how Jin Ling still seems in awe of Sizhui\u2019s father. \n\u201cThank you for arranging accommodations for us,\u201d Lan Wangji says, passive as always. He seems to be appraising Jin Ling, who straighten up under his gaze. \n\u201cN-Not at all! My family insisted!\u201d\nThey move to the boarding area soon after that. Shanghai West is the departure station for their high speed rail, and the station attendants let them board the business class cabin without fanfare. Jingyi is impressed by the extra leg room in their row, and soon turns their chairs around so all four seats face each other. The cabin is half empty, so no one complains about the noise.\nJin Ling is still on his phone when the train begins moving. \u201cMy mother is sending someone to pick us up from Yunmeng station. Most of my family is already at the estate.\u201d\nIt must be nice to be rich, Jingyi thinks. His own parents have to work through the weekend before their break officially starts on Monday. Jingyi had only gotten away with his last-minute vacation plans due to Lan Wangji\u2019s participation and his improved math grade. He continues nibbling on the sunflower seeds Sizhui packed. \u201cWhat about your dog?\u201d\n\u201cFairy is traveling with Xiaojiu.\u201d Jin Ling looks visibly excited at the mention of his dog. Behind him, sceneries flash through the window as the train picks up speed. \u201cBut my parents are taking him back to Lanling after this.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to see Fairy again,\u201d Sizhui offers. He turns to his father as if expecting Lan Wangji to contribute to the conversation with some farfetched declaration of being excited to see Wei Wuxian. This, of course, does not happen.\nFor the most part, Lan Wangji is blissfully quiet through the ride. He reads a novel silently while Jingyi cycles through a series of proposals to keep them busy. They play cards, a multiplayer game on Jin Ling\u2019s iPad, and then cards again. Lan Wangji orders them late lunches when the cart ladies comes around with boxed meal, but leaves his own serving mostly untouched while the boys inhale their food. \nA few people onboard and offboard the cabin at the intermittent stops between Shanghai and Yunmeng. After a while, Jin Ling dozes off against the window while Jingyi watches the scenery change from urban snapshots to the wide expanse of the countryside. Just for fun, Jingyi snaps a photo of Jin Ling\u2019s sleeping face with a dog filter and shows it to Sizhui.\n\u201cBehave,\u201d Sizhui mouths silently, despite looking amused. \nThe three hour ride ends unexpectedly fast, and soon Jingyi is shaking Jin Ling awake while Sizhui moves their luggages from the overhead compartments. \u201cWake up, Little Mistress! We need you to navigate us~\u201d\nJin Ling manages to glare through sleepy eyes. Still, he leads them off the train and into the utter chaos that is Yunmeng station. \u201cWhat?\u201d Jin Ling asks when a family almost runs into him. \u201cI told you this is a popular tourist destination.\u201d\nWith utmost determination and a little bit of side stepping, they manage to make it out of the exit to find a sea of taxis and personal cars parked in the arrival area. Jin Ling immediately locates a man holding a purple sign and leads them to him.\n\u201cWelcome back, Young Master Jin.\u201d\n\u201cDriver Li,\u201d Jin Ling says importantly. \u201cTake us to your vehicle.\u201d\nThe vehicle turns out to be a luxury minivan. Jingyi bites the inside of his mouth as Driver Li loads all of their stuff into the trunk. He supposes this is better than cramming into a taxi, and tries his best to keep his mouth shut while climbing into the back row of the van. \n\u201cWe will arrive in forty minutes,\u201d Drive Li tells them as they pull out of the station. \u201cPlease help yourself to snacks and beverages in the middle compartment.\u201d\nJin Ling has the audacity to take the front passenger seat. While he asks Driver Li questions about traffic, Sizhui turns to his father.\n\u201cHave you visited Yunmeng before?\u201d\nLan Wangji doesn\u2019t turn his head from the window. \u201cNo,\u201d he says almost wistfully.\nThe station is located in a rural part of Yunmeng, amidst vast fields of crops broken by tiny stone houses. Every so often, their van has to slow down to weave around small work vehicles and farmers pulling donkeys along. The main road follows the curvature of a large lake, the surface so wide and smooth that Jingyi can\u2019t see where the water ends. But the scenery soon changes into something more commercialized, and farm houses are replaced with newly built villas. \n\u201cThis is lovely,\u201d Sizhui says when the road begins expanding, and they see more visitors milling about. \nWhen they drive through a large stylized archway, Jin Ling turns to them and says, \u201cWelcome to Lotus Pier. Well, this is only the outer edge. My grandparents\u2019 estate is towards the other end.\u201d\n\u201cThe Jiang family home is famous for its architecture,\u201d Driver Li explains as the car pulls off the main road and towards what appears to be a dock. \u201cIt\u2019s surrounded by water, and visitors at Lotus Pier regard it as a signature landmark.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are we stopping here?\u201d Jin Ling asks when Driver Li parks the vehicle. They\u2019re currently at a dock that doubles as a viewing area, with other families parked nearby as they sit at picnic tables overlooking the water. \nDriver Li opens the door for Jin Ling. \u201cThe rest of the road is blocked by tourist traffic. It would take another hour for us to reach the estate. Madam Jiang has advised you to take the boat. We will part here.\u201d\nJingyi looks around the pier. There are a few sailboats docked by the water, but what Driver Li leads to them to can only be described as a small yacht. \u201cAre we taking this?\u201d\nWhile Driver Li diligently moves their luggage, another man appears from the inside of the boat. He\u2019s round and tall and tan, and the hand he sets on Jin Ling\u2019s shoulder is nothing short of friendly. \u201cYoung Master Jin! You\u2019re so tall now! Do you remember me?\u201d\n\u201cWu-Shushu,\u201d Jin Ling says, his nose high in the air. \u201cLong time no see.\u201d\n\u201cLao Wu,\u201d Driver Li cuts in. \u201cSomeone should be waiting for them at the West Port.\u201d\n\u201cGot it, got it,\u201d Lao Wu laughs as he gestures for Jingyi and Sizhui and Lan Wangji to come onboard. \u201cI\u2019ve been sailing this boat for Master Jiang for thirty years, and Driver Li still feels the need to remind me every time. I\u2019m telling you-- I\u2019ve been doing this since Mistress Yanli has been a child. Just because I took Master Jin to the wrong dock in the middle of the night once... Oh, Driver Li, stop giving me the stink eye! They\u2019re in good hands!\u201d\n\u201cYou did that to my dad?\u201d Jin Ling asks, mouth wide. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nLao Wu waits until everyone has boarded to turn on the engine. \u201cWhy? Young Masters Jiang and Wei told me to, of course! They thought it would be a fun prank to ambush your father. Those boys have always been trouble makers, but no harm done, you see? Your parents are happily married, years later!\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking,\u201d Sizhui says when Lao Wu is done laughing at his own story. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n\u201cThe Jiang family has a private dock on the west end of their estate. Before the main roads were built, taking the boat was the fastest way of getting to the rest of Lotus Pier! We\u2019ve been doing this for decades. My old man worked for Master Jiang\u2019s father, and now I work for Master Jiang.\"\nJingyi squints as the boat starts to move. On the dock, a little girl is waving at them. Jingyi waves back. \u201cWhat is this? Your grandparents have servants?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re staff, not servants!\u201d Jin Ling huffs.\n\u201cJingyi, don\u2019t be rude,\u201d Lan Wangji speaks up for the first time in an hour. \nLao Wu just cackles some more. \u201cNo offense taken! There\u2019s no better employer in Lotus Pier than Master Jiang! We almost got bought out by commercial realtors around thirty years ago. They wanted to drive all the locals out and fill this place with chains! But then the Jiang family stepped in and bought out the land so they can keep leasing to the locals. We used to just be a fishing port fifty years ago, and now look at us! Tourism keeps bringing money in! Business is good!\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Jingyi mumbles after a bit. \u201cGuess your grandparents are cool after all.\u201d\nOver the water, the Jiang estate appears like a vision. As the boat pulls closer, they\u2019re greeted by patches of lotus almost floating on the water, as if parting a path just for them. Jingyi can make out the shape of a woman standing on the end of the wooden boardwalk, her long purple skirt swaying in the breeze. She\u2019s flanked by identical small girls on each side.\n\u201cMom!\u201d Jin Ling gasps. He doesn\u2019t wait for the boat to dock properly before jumping onto the wooden steps and enveloping his mother in a hug. \n\u201cA-Ling,\u201d Jiang Yanli laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you too!\u201d Next to her, the girls tug on Jin Ling\u2019s arms and legs and clothes, going Gege! Gege! Gege!.\nJin Ling is playing when the kids when Lao Wu finally secures the connection between the boat and the dock. Jin Ling looks sheepish, but not embarrassed. \u201cSorry, Han Guang-Jun. This is my mother.\u201d\nLan Wangji gives Jiang Yanli a nod. \u201cThank you for your hospitality.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so formal, Han Guang-Jun. I\u2019m still indebted to your brother after all the help he\u2019s given me. Not to mention how close Ze Wu-Jun is to A-Ling\u2019s shushu. Our families are so close already, it\u2019s an honor and a pleasure to have you here.\u201d Coming from anyone else, her words may seem insincere or over-exaggerated. Yet there\u2019s something calming and genuine about her voice that puts Jingyi at ease.\nEventually, Lan Wangji says. \u201cThe honor is ours. This is Lan Sizhui and Lan Jingyi.\u201d\nJiang Yanli smiles directly at Jingyi. \u201cI\u2019ve heard so much about you two from A-Ling. It\u2019s not everyday my son brings friends home.\u201d \n\u201cMom!\u201d Jin Ling yells, face red.\nJiang Yanli smiles even more, gesturing for the twins to come to her. \u201cThese are my daughters, Tiantian and Qianqian.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d\n\u201cHe stayed behind to watch Fairy with Bingbing,\u201d Jiang Yanli says, letting go of Qianqian\u2019s hand when the child decides to cozy up to Sizhui. Tiantian, however, stays half hidden behind her mother. It would have been impossible to tell them apart if not for the introduction. \u201cRemember, you promised to keep Fairy away from A-Xian.\u201d\n\u201cShould I call you Lingling now?\u201d Jingyi asks while Jiang Yanli speaks to Lao Wu. \n\u201cOnly if you want to die,\u201d Jin Ling hisses. \nTwo more staff members appear then, moving everyone\u2019s luggage onto a rolling cart. They nod when Jiang Yanli asks them to take the bags to the East Wing, where the guests will be staying. \n\u201cWe are only operating at half capacity at the moment,\u201d Jiang Yanli explains when they begin walking away from the water, towards the estate. \u201cMost of the staff went home for the holidays. We even sent our nanny on vacation, so I hope you don\u2019t mind the noise. Tiantian, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nTiantian is completely silently, gripping her mother\u2019s hand while Qianiqan circles around Sizhui like he\u2019s a fun new toy. \u201cUp up,\u201d she says quietly when everyone looks at her.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jingyi asks.\n\u201cUp up,\u201d Tiantian says again. \u201cI want bao bao!\u201d\n\u201cShe wants to be picked up,\u201d Jin Ling translates.\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost there,\u201d Jiang Yanli tells her daughter. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to walk just like Qianqian and Gege?\u201d\nThe desire to be just like her siblings seems to trump Tiantian\u2019s need to be picked up, and she goes back to following her mother silently. They continue at a leisurely pace until the wooden boardwalk turns into a stone path through the gardens, the expanding walkway framed by poles with large purple lanterns hanging on top. In the distance, to their right, Jingyi spots smaller pond with a gazebo on top.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my mother\u2019s favorite place to lounge,\u201d Jiang Yanli explains when she catches Jingyi looking. \u201cDuring the summertime, you can come out in the evenings to see fireflies on the waters. In fact, I think there\u2019s a tree near the gazebo that A-Cheng and A-Xian used to mark their height on growing up.\u201d \nAt the mention of Wei Wuxian, Lan Wangji turns his head to the pond as well. \nJiang Yanli just hums. \u201cThe garden was especially designed by my mother. It\u2019s her pride and joy, and she severely punished my brothers when she discovered them carving into her favorite elm tree. Oh, we\u2019re almost here.\u201d\nSure enough, they soon arrive at a stone moon gate that connects the gardens to a courtyard. Waiting at the entrance are two people who look undeniably related to their little mistress.\nAt the sight of Jin Ling, Fairy jumps out of the teenage girl\u2019s arm and comes bouncing along until he\u2019s climbing up Jin Ling\u2019s legs. Jin Ling picks him up immediately and laughs when Fairy licks his face in excitement. \u201cCalm down, it\u2019s just me!\u201d\n\u201cJust you is enough. Welcome back, A-Ling,\u201d Jin Zixuan says while Tiantian immediately latches onto him. Up close, Jingyi can see how Jin Ling shares the same haughty nose and curved mouth as his father. \u201cHan Guang-Jun, long time no see.\u201d\nWhile Jin Zixuan and Lan Wangji exchange pleasantries, Qianqian pulls Sizhui\u2019s arm down and loudly whispers, \u201cthat\u2019s Daddy, he\u2019s the best,\u201d into Sizhui\u2019s ear. \n\u201cShe loves strangers,\u201d the person who has to be Jin Bing tells Jingyi. She\u2019s almost his height and can probably pass for Jin Ling\u2019s twin if not for the look of passive disinterest on her face as she listens to another round of introductions. The Jin genes really run strongly in this family, Jingyi thinks but doesn\u2019t say.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go in,\u201d Jiang Yanli suggests after Fairy has calmed down. She gives Jin Ling a firm look that gets Jin Ling to quickly clip Fairy\u2019s leash onto his collar. They\u2019re led through a series of paths until arriving at a large, four-sided courtyard. Facing the north is an open-air hall. At the top of the steps sits a stern looking woman in a throne-like chair. Jiang Yanli smiles up at her. \u201cA-Niang, our guests are here.\u201d\nYu Ziyuan descends slowly down the steps until she\u2019s looming over them. \u201cHan Guang-Jun. Welcome to my home. My husband is taking care of some business with my son. Please excuse their absence.\u201d Everything that comes out of her mouth sounds more like an order than a request.\n\u201cThank you for having us,\u201d Lan Wangji says, perhaps for the 10th time that day. He looks at Sizhui.\nAs if on cue, Sizhui steps forward. \u201cMadam Yu, thank you for extending your hospitality to us. Please accept this box of sweets from Gusu\u2019s famous dessert shop. They\u2019re infused with chili, which Jin Ling told us may be to your liking. We also brought three jars of Emperor\u2019s Smile from my great uncle\u2019s collection, along with a box of fresh crystal loquats.\u201d\nYu Ziyuan eyes offerings appraisingly. After an eternity, she says, \u201cI didn\u2019t know Lan Qiren had a taste for rice wine.\u201d\n\u201cUncle has an interest in collecting them,\u201d Lan Wangji speaks up when Sizhui gets flustered under Yu Ziyan\u2019s gaze. \n\u201cVery well,\u201d Yu Ziyuan says as she calls a staff member forward. \u201cHave Chef Wang use the loquats in tonight\u2019s meal. He knows how Jiang Fengmian likes it prepared. Serve the sweets for dessert. I\u2019ll be the judge of whether A-Ling knows my taste.\u201d\nA small smile breaks across Jiang Yanli\u2019s face, and Jingyi takes that as a sign Madam Yu has more or less accepted them. \u201cLet\u2019s set the Emperor\u2019s Smile aside for tomorrow, when A-Xian arrives. He\u2019ll be disappointed if we drink it all without him.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Madam.\u201d The staffer accepts all the gifts and hurries away. \n\u201cHan Guang-Jun,\u201d Yu Ziyuan continues. \u201cI have some thoughts about your brother\u2019s contribution to the exhibition in Hangzhou. Since he\u2019s not here, I hope you\u2019ll indulge me and hear me out?\u201d Again, her request is worded more like a demand, and Lan Wangji slowly goes to her side. \u201cLet\u2019s walk and talk while the children settle in. A-Li, help everyone to their quarters, won\u2019t you?\u201d \n\u201cOf course,\u201d Jiang Yanli says, but Madam Yu is already off, commanding Lan Wangji to follow.\nEveryone waits until they\u2019re both out of sight to relax. Jingyi nudges Sizhui. \u201cYour face was so red! It\u2019s like you forgot to breathe!\u201d\n\u201cShe has that effect on people,\u201d Jin Ling says, sympathetic. Even Fairy has stayed on his best behavior. \n\u201cCan I go now?\u201d Jin Bing asks, looking bored by it all. Upon getting a nod of approval from Jiang Yanli, she disappears around the corner, presumably back to her room. \u201cCome, Fairy!\u201d\nJin Ling looks betrayed when his dog goes bouncing after his sister happily.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be upset,\u201d Jiang Yanli laughs softly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been home in so long, and Bingbing usually takes care of Fairy when you\u2019re gone. Although A-Cheng definitely spoiled him for the last few weeks.\u201d\nAs if following Jin Bing\u2019s lead, one of the twins tugs on Jin Zixuan\u2019s hand. \u201cI wanna go too\u2026 I\u2019m tired..\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s about that time. \u201d Jiang Yanli sets a hand on her husband\u2019s arm. \u201cCan you put them down for a nap? You remember where I left their bag, right? Qianqian\u2019s blanket is still in our room.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Jin Zixuan says, looking more amused than annoyed. \u201cI can do this much.\u201d\nAs if to prove her dad otherwise, the twin currently standing next to Jin Ling starts complaining. \u201cI don\u2019t want to nap! I want to play with Gege!\u201d\n\u201cGege is busy with Lan-gege,\u201d Jiang Yanli replies, trying to hide her laughter at the sight of Jin Zixuan\u2019s astonished face. \u201cHe\u2019ll have time for you after your nap, Qianqian.\u201d\n\u201cI want to play with Lan-Gege!\u201d Qianqian stumps her little leg on the ground. \u201cI\u2019ll show him the entire house! I\u2019ll be the host!\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even know the layout of the entire house,\u201d Jin Zixuan says. When Qianqian looks offended at his suggestion and her face turns red, on the precipice of tears, Jin Zixuan adds, \u201cCan you relax?\u201d\nThe only thing funnier than Jin Zixuan asking a four year old to relax is the look of betrayal on Jin Ling\u2019s face at the suggestion that his sister likes Sizhui more than him. \n\u201cI\u2019m feeling a little tired too,\u201d Sizhui suggests when Qianqian is on the verge of a fit. \u201cLet\u2019s both take naps. Then we can play when we\u2019re both energized. How about that? I\u2019ll be here for the week. We have plenty of time to play. You can show me the rest of the house too.\u201d\nQianqian considers this for a moment. \u201cokay.\u201d \nIt\u2019s not until Jin Ling\u2019s parents have led the twins away that Jingyi bursts out laughing. Jin Ling\u2019s glare doesn\u2019t help, and Jingyi is wiping tears of mirth from his eyes when Jin Ling leads them to the East Wing, where their luggage is already waiting. Sizhui and Jingyi have been assigned to connected rooms, the layout reminiscent of a traditional guesthouse. \u201cThis place is humongous,\u201d Jingyi says after testing the bed. It\u2019s firm but comfortable. \u201cYour grandparents are crazy rich.\u201d\nJin Ling gives him a funny look. \u201cOur property in Lanling is even bigger.\u201d\n\u201cOf course it is.\u201d Jingyi flops with his back down on the bed. \u201cDon\u2019t forget though, we\u2019re here for business, not pleasure.\u201d\nThis makes Jin Ling tsk. \u201cStop acting like we\u2019re here on a secret mission. How difficult can it be to set two old men up?\u201d\nJingyi says \u201cpretty difficult\u201d the same time Sizhui says \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call them old.\u201d \n\u201cWhat is your plan anyway? Are you going to lock them in the same room?\u201d Jin Ling takes a seat on the bed and slap absently at Jingyi\u2019s leg.\n\u201cLove needs to blossom naturally!\u201d Jingyi huffs. \u201cBeing locked in a dark room isn\u2019t romantic! We need ambience! We need the mood to be perfect. We need Han Guang-Jun to look up at Wei Wuxian, bathed in moonlight, and he realize he\u2019s fallen in love!\u201d\n\u201cWhat you need is to stop. You\u2019re almost bad as Bingbing. All she does is stay in her room reading internet novels and talking to her online friends!\u201d\nJingyi promptly sits up. \u201cOh\u2026 I wonder which one she\u2019s reading? Maybe she can give me recommendations.\u201d When Jin Ling gives him an incredulous look, Jingyi brushes it off and goes to open his suitcase. Jingyi and Sizhui spend the rest of the afternoon unpacking with the door between their rooms open and Jin Ling lording over them. By the time Jiang Yanli comes to announce dinner, all three of them are lying horizontally on Jingyi\u2019s bed, watching videos on Jin Ling\u2019s phone.\nDinner is extravagant as expected, with enough food to feed a small village. What\u2019s more impressive is how many dishes now contain the loquats they\u2019ve brought, ranging from fried to steamed to stewed. Jingyi\u2019s mouth is already watering by the time he\u2019s seated between Jin Ling and Sizhui, although he abruptly straightens up when Madam Yu\u2019s gaze passes over him.\nSitting at the head of the table, under a pair of elaborate wall scrolls, is Jiang Fengmian. He looks incredibly mild next to his scowling wife, both of them instructing the staff on place settings. After some deliberation, Jiang Cheng takes the seat to Madam Yu\u2019s right. Han Guang-Jun sits wordlessly on the other side of Jiang Fengmian while the twins are flanked by their parents. Jin Bing, in a power move that will probably never be mastered by her brother, appears at the last minutes and slides effortlessly into the only empty seat left. \n\u201cWelcome to my home,\u201d Jiang Fengmian begins when all the staff have stepped aside, \u201cI apologize for seating us in the reserved dining area for now. Tomorrow we will dine in in the main hall.\u201d\nJingyi almost chokes on his water. There\u2019s another dining room even bigger than this? He recovers just in time, no thanks to Jin Ling swatting him unsympathetically on the back.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not everyday that we have the honor of hosting the Lan family,\u201d Jiang Fengmian continues with a good humored smile. \u201cMy wife and I have been long time acquaintances of Lan Qiren. It\u2019s my wish that he, too, will visit Lotus Pier.\u201d\n\u201cUncle would be honored,\u201d is all Lan Wangji says. \nWhether Headmaster Lan would actually step foot in Yunmeng, no one will know. This doesn\u2019t deter Jiang Fengmian. \u201cIt\u2019s always a great blessing when I can be surrounded by my children and grandchildren, although A-Xian won\u2019t be joining us until tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cWe would have more grandchildren if Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian would hurry up and get married already,\u201d Madam Yu cuts in, shooting a glare at her son. \u201cThose two\u2026 All they do is run around with no regards to their responsibilities\u2026\u201d\nThe look of great consternation on Jiang Cheng\u2019s face suggests this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s heard this rant. Regardless, he stays silent.\n\u201cYu Ziyuan and I are very happy to be with the grandchildren we have now,\u201d Jiang Fengmian adds, offering the kids a smile that\u2019s met with a blush from Jin Ling, silence from Jin Bing, and vague noises from the twins who complain about wanting to eat already. This sends the Jiang head into a bemused laugh. \u201cWell. Without further ado, let\u2019s eat!\u201d\nThe food is good. Really good. Jingyi doesn\u2019t have time to offer compliments, too busy stuffing his face. He zones out on all the small talk and focuses on the slow turning of the glass top on the table as new dishes are presented before him. Jin Ling tsks at his behavior but still waves staff over to refill Jingyi\u2019s teacup whenever it runs out. Soon, Jin Ling gets called away to fill the adults\u2019 glasses with alcohol, and Sizhui is left with the sole duty of making sure Jingyi doesn\u2019t choke himself to death on food.\n\u201cDoes Lan Qiren even feed these kids at school?\u201d Madam Yu huffs. \u201cWe can\u2019t have him starving A-Ling in Gusu.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Jin Ling insists, face red at the sudden attention. \u201cMom sends me lots of snacks and the food is okay. Dad and Xiaojiu all came out of it okay.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s questionable.\u201d\nJiang Cheng looks like he has something to say, but he stops himself from participating in the conversation by putting more rice in his mouth. A cowardly tactic, if Jingyi has ever seen one.\n\u201cA-Ling is doing fine,\u201d Jiang Yanli says while cutting the meat in Tiantian\u2019s bowl into tiny pieces. Her husband seems to be less successful, since Qianqian keeps ordering her dad to do it better! This one is shaped weird! \u201cHe\u2019s even grown a bit since starting school.\u201d\nMadam Yu narrows her eyes and beckons Jin Ling over to fuss over him. \u201cDid you get taller? I\u2019ll be the judge of that. Your dad has good genes, so you should be fine, but it doesn\u2019t hurt for you to eat more.\u201d\n\u201cT-thank you?\u201d Jin Zixuan says, looking surprised by the sudden compliment, if one can call it that. While he\u2019s not looking, Qianqian snatches the fried egg from his bowl and pops it in her mouth with quick work of her chopsticks. \nDinner continues for hours, even after Jingyi had overeaten and driven himself into a pseudo-food coma. He\u2019s half leaning on Sizhui\u2019s side when staff members come out with the dessert they brought from Gusu. Everyone is served a piece on a delicate, lotus-shaped plate, but Jin Ling trades his with Jingyi when he decides he likes Jingyi\u2019s better. \nIt\u2019s already late in the evening when everyone is dismissed from dinner. Jingyi barely remembers Jin Ling showing them where his room is. He splashes some water on his face and calls it a night. \nIn the morning, Jingyi fumbles his way to the bathroom for a quick shower and discovers Sizhui is already awake. They chat idly about their non-existent plans while Sizhui tidies up.\n\u201cWe should really ask Jin Ling what\u2019s next,\u201d Sizhui suggests.\nJingyi checks his phone to find it\u2019s already 10am. \u201cJin Ling should be up. Let\u2019s go.\u201d He traces last night\u2019s steps until arriving at the room that Jin Ling is staying in and abruptly throws the door open. \u201cLittle Mistress, are you up ye-\u201d\n\u201cI told you not to call me that,\u201d Jin Ling mumbles from his spot on the floor. Standing behind him is one of the twins, who\u2019s busy brushing Jin Ling\u2019s hair with a plastic toy. Behind her is the other twin, clipping bows into her sister\u2019s hair. Behind both of them is Jiang Yanli, who patiently combs the girls\u2019 hair out. Fairy lies lazily in front of Jin Ling, happily showing his belly as Jin Ling works on absently brushing him. It\u2019s an incredible snapshot of domesticity.\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Jiang Yanli says when Jingyi fails to contain his laughter. She\u2019s busy braiding one of the girl\u2019s hair. \u201cHave you boys had breakfast yet? There\u2019s a spread laid out in the dining area from last night.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Sizhui says, just as one of the girls comes over to tug at him. She pushes Sizhui to sit on the floor next to Jin Ling and demands to do his hair too.\nJiang Yanli puts all the hair accessories back into a small box with the help of the other twin. \u201cDon\u2019t bother Lan-Gege, Qianqian. We\u2019re almost done anyway. Don\u2019t you want to go to the lake with Daddy? You made him promise to go with you and Tiantian.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Qianqian says importantly, as if deliberating a grave issue. Jingyi has a few ideas where she may have picked that up from. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nIt takes a while for the girls to pack up. They look offended when Jin Ling pulls a pink heart-shaped clip out of his hair and tries to hand it back, so Jin Ling is forced to wear it until his mother has led both girls out of the room. \n\u201cJin hair salon, huh?\u201d Jingyi grins. \n\u201cIt was worse when they wanted to be chefs and tried to make me eat plastic food.\u201d\nJingyi just cackles more. \u201cWhat\u2019s our plan for the day?\u201d\n\u201cFood first.\u201d\nTogether, the three of them make it to the dining area. Lan Wangji is already there, silently working on his congee, so they sit down next to him with their assortment of buns and soups. When asked, Lan Wangji admits he\u2019s been invited by Jiang Fengmian to discuss business, which leaves the three of them with no chaperone and no supervision. \nAfter breakfast, Jin Ling takes them on a stroll through the marketplace at Lotus Pier. Merchants line both sides of the street as they blend into crowds of tourists. Jingyi is surprised to find that the shop fronts are all different, each promising a new Yunmeng speciality that he hasn\u2019t seen before. For lunch, they have something light at one of the restaurants overlooking the water. The owner recognizes Jin Ling immediately and tries to give them food on the house, but Jin Ling settles the bill with a gold card that he pulls out of a tacky designer label wallet. \nLotus Pier is bustling with noise from every corner, but it\u2019s a fun kind of rowdiness that makes Jingyi thrum with excitement. He drags Jin Ling and Sizhui around by the arms as they sample all the street food and find suitable souvenirs for Jingyi\u2019s parents. \nThe sun is making its way towards the horizon when they finally wander back to the Jiang estate. They\u2019re greeted by a strange scene in the East Wing courtyard, where the twins are crouched around a large tree. At the top, on a particularly thick branch, sits Wei Wuxian. He waves at the sight of them. \n\u201cAh! A-Yuan! Lingling! Little Lan!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d Jin Ling huffs the same time Jingyi shouts \u201cMy name is Lan Jingyi!\u201d up into the tree.\nSizhui glances around. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cDajiu brought us a kite and it\u2019s stuck in a tree,\u201d Tiantian says quietly, her eyes watering. \u201cXiaojiu went to find a ladder but Dajiu climbed up. He\u2019s stuck.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not stuck!\u201d Wei Wuxian shouts down, one arm holding the offending kite. \u201cI can come down at any point! In fact, I\u2019ll do it right now!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna break a leg!\u201d Jin Ling hisses. \u201cJust stay up there and wait for the ladder!\u201d\nIf anything, this just spurns Wei Wuxian to move more. He drops the kite and laughs when Jin Ling leaps forward to catch it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, Ling-zi! I can do it! You\u2019re not strong enough to catch me anyway!\u201d\n\u201cJust stay up there!\u201d Jingyi snaps at him. \u201cYou\u2019re way too high up!\u201d\n\u201cMove aside! I\u2019m seriously going to jump!\u201d\n\u201cNO!\u201d Jingyi and Jin Ling scream in synchrony. \nThankfully, Lan Wangji appears then. He takes one look at the scene and seems to understand the situation. With a wave of his arm, he dismisses both Jin Ling and Jingyi. Even the girls step aside, hiding behind Sizhui. \u201cWei Ying. Don\u2019t do anything rash.\u201d\nWei Wuxian just laughs more. \u201cLan Zhan! What are you gonna do? You can\u2019t stop me! Are you gonna catch me?\u201d\nA beat passes before Lan Wangji opens his arms. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\u201cOkay! Here I come!\u201d\nMultiple things happen at once: Sizhui steps in front of both girls and covers the view in case their uncle does break a leg, Jingyi grabs Jin Ling\u2019s arm in a moment of suspense, and Wei Wuxian leaps down from the branch without a worry. Wei Wuxian\u2019s movement is followed by the sound of fluttering fabric as Lan Wangji manages to grab ahold of him, his whole body twisting from the momentum until Lan Wangji turns around, both of his arms wrapped around Wei Wuxian in an incredible bridal carry that reminds Jingyi of clutch saves in wuxia films. \nEven more incredible is the fact that Wei Wuxian makes no effort to part from Lan Wangji\u2019s embrace. \u201cLan Zhan! You\u2019re so strong!\u201d\n\u201cStrong!\u201d Qianqian says, making grabby hands up. \u201cI want to be picked up too! Up up!\u201d\n\u201cLan-shushu is busy picking me up. You gotta wait your turn!\u201d\nQianqian looks like she wants to argue, but Jiang Cheng appears then with the aforementioned ladder. She runs right to him, tugging at Jiang Cheng\u2019s arm until he crouches down to listen. Jiang Cheng\u2019s eyes narrow slowly as he takes in the scene. He glares at Wei Wuxian, who is still in Lan Wangji\u2019s arms. \u201cI was gone for ten minutes.\u201d\nThe only response he gets is an absent wave of Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand. \u201cYou took too long, and now you can\u2019t play the hero!\u201d\nJiang Cheng looks like he has some words for Wei Wuxian that he can\u2019t say in front of the kids, so he just tsks loudly. He\u2019s starting to leave with the ladder when Jin Zixuan appears, prompting both girls to fly to his side. \nTo his credit, Jin Zixuan doesn\u2019t even ask what\u2019s going on, like he can\u2019t be bothered to comprehend Wei Wuxian\u2019s shenanigans. \u201cI came to tell you all that dinner is ready. Han Guang-Jun, you may want to put my brother-in-law down.\u201d\n\u201cLooks like you have to let me go. We don\u2019t want people to get the wrong idea, Lan Er Gege~.\u201d\nWhat wrong idea?! Jingyi wants to scream. People can only get the RIGHT idea!\nStill, everyone is presentable by the time they arrive at the main dining room. If possible, the food spread is even larger today. Everyone settles into a familiar seating arrangement, with the addition of Wei Wuxian at Lan Wangji\u2019s side. Today, they\u2019re saved from a speech and allowed to dig in immediately. Jingyi is amazed to find that not a single dish from last night\u2019s feast has been repeated.\n\u201cLan Zhan, you gotta try this. It\u2019s my favorite!\u201d Wei Wuxian say while picking food from a few dishes up with his chopsticks and setting them in Lan Wangji\u2019s bowl.\nJingyi\u2019s eyes nearly fall out of their sockets at the sight. Almost everything is covered with chilli powder to the point where the food is indistinguishable. \u201cAre you trying to kill Han Guang-Jun?!\u201d\nWei Wuxian pauses. \u201cWhat? Lan Zhan loves spicy food!\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d Sizhui says helpfully. \u201cFather\u2019s palette is quite bland.\u201d\n\u201cReally? But he used to always orders spicy food when we ate together. I thought we had the same taste\u2026 Lan Zhan, your appetite really dulled through the years!\u201d He looks to the other adults for agreement, but Jiang Cheng just rolls his eyes.\nLan Wangji doesn't respond. Instead, he valiantly puts a chilli-covered piece of meat into his mouth and swallows it whole. \n\u201cThat\u2019s one way of doing it,\u201d Jin Zixuan mumbles, his own bowl devoid of red colored items. He gives Lan Wangji a sympathetic look and goes back to picking soft food for his daughter.\nThe Emperor\u2019s Smile comes out soon after that, and Wei Wuxian\u2019s entire face light up at the sight of the jars. He beckons Jin Ling over to pour for him, which ends in a round of toasts with all the men of the family. \nWhen Lan Wangji shakes his head at Jin Ling, Madam Yu speaks up. \u201cHan Guang-Jun? Aren\u2019t you going to drink with us? You didn\u2019t touch the wine at all yesterday. Surely, if you don\u2019t like Emperor\u2019s Smile, then we can find you something else from my husband\u2019s collection.\u201d\nLan Wangji stares resolutely at his cup and reaches for it. He\u2019s foiled, however, when Wei Wuxian snatches the cup and downs the liquor. \nNext to Jingyi, Sizhui lets out a small breath of relief. \n\u201cLan Zhan has really bad alcohol tolerance! I\u2019ll drink for him!\u201d Wei Wuxian offers. \u201cI can handle both of our shares and still outdrink Jiang Cheng and Jin Zixuan!\u201d\n\u201cA-Xian,\u201d Jiang Fengmian says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a competition.\u201d\n\u201cBesides! Lan Zhan is such an angry drunk! The last time we drank together, he stuck to my side the entire time! I couldn\u2019t shake him off at all because he was so mad at me, haha! Let\u2019s not offend Han Guang-Jun with our drinking habits!\u201d\nEveryone is quiet, staring Wei Wuxian in disbelief. \n\u201cLet\u2019s not pressure Han Guang-Jun,\u201d Jiang Yanli suggests, an unreadable smile on her face. \u201cBesides, you should also hold off on the alcohol, Father. It\u2019s bad for your blood pressure. Why don\u2019t you have some lotus rib soup? I helped Chef Wang prepare it.\u201d \nWhile everyone is served a bowl of soup, Madam Yu turns to Wei Wuxian. \u201cIt\u2019s best if you stop bothering Han Guang-Jun. He\u2019s too polite to say otherwise, but I\u2019m sure Han Guang-Jun is only tolerating your overly familiar behavior.\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s smile wavers. He straightens himself up and moves away from Lan Wangji when the man in question stops him. \n\u201cWei Ying does not bother me. I enjoy his company.\u201d A moment of silence passes over them as every member of the family stares at Lan Wangji. Still, his passive expression remains the same, unmovable as always.\nEventually, Madam Yu lets out of a bark of laughter. It\u2019s equal parts incredulous and amused. \u201cIf that\u2019s the way it is, then suit yourself.\u201d\nLater, when dinner is finished and everyone is dismissed, Jin Ling confesses this is the closest thing to approval he has heard from his grandmother. \n\u201cAt least she approves of this marriage,\u201d Jingyi mumbles, remembering how Wei Wuxian had downed alcohol like water and walked away from it all unfazed. Jin Zixuan had called it quits early, saying he needed to help the girls get ready for bed. It was a cowardly escape, leaving Jiang Cheng to drink against Wei Wuxian. By the time dessert was finished, Jiang Cheng was busy flicking open peanut casings and sunflower seeds and Wei Wuxian while Wei Wuxian draped himself over Lan Wangji. Madam Yu herself had gone cup to cup against Wei Wuxian before bowing out, to the great amusement and concern of her husband. Really, the entire Jiang family was intent on showing each other up in strange ways that Jingyi cannot begin to comprehend. \u201cHey. Maybe Wei Wuxian and Han Guang-Jun will drunkenly hook up.\u201d\nJin Ling makes a disgusted face. \u201cEw. Don\u2019t think about that.\u201d\nTo Jingyi\u2019s disappointment, Han Guang-Jun and Wei Wuxian do not drunkenly hook up that night. Jingyi knows because he gives himself the task of camping behind a bush outside of Wei Wuxian\u2019s quarters, just to catch a glimpse of Jin Ling\u2019s uncle retiring for the night. If they\u2019re lucky, Wei Wuxian would drag a compliant Lan Wangji in with him! Unfortunately, Jingyi\u2019s luck has always been rotten, and he finds himself getting a cramp from crouching for so long. It\u2019s a good thing he didn\u2019t invite Sizhui and Jin Ling along, both of them too indignant for such an important task like espionage. \n\u201cUrg,\u201d Jingyi hisses when his phone runs out of battery. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s who?\u201d A voice asks, and Jingyi falls on his butt at the surprise. Wei Wuxian grins back at him, also squatting behind the same bush. \u201cWho are we spying on?\u201d\nYou! Jingyi thinks but bites his lips from saying. He sits up, crossed legged. \u201cN-nothing! I just heard \u2026That... That this area of the house is haunted. I wanted to see the ghost with my own eyes.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s A-Yuan and Ling\u2019er?\u201d\nJingyi tries to feign annoyance. \u201cSizhui doesn\u2019t believe in ghosts and Jin Ling went to sleep already.\u201d\n\u201cI see. They have no appreciation for the wonderful world of the occult!\u201d They\u2019re both crouched on the grass with nothing but the courtyard lanterns illuminating the area, yet Wei Wuxian\u2019s grin is unbearably bright. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go hunting with me?\u201d\n\u201cHunting? For what?\u201d\nWei Wuxian shoots up, grabbing Jingyi\u2019s arm in the process. \u201cGhosts, of course! Let\u2019s go!\u201d He effortlessly drags a fumbling Jingyi out of the courtyard and through a series of walkways. They encounter a few members of the nightstaff on the way, but for the most part, the estate is silent and peaceful if not for Jingyi\u2019s sputtering. \n\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d Jingyi demands.\n\u201cThe most haunted part of this place!\u201d Wei Wuxian replies cheerfully. He then proceeds show Jingyi a series of baffling locations in the estate: a well where a servant was apparently pushed in by a jealous lover, Madam Yu\u2019s favorite gazebo which allegedly lights up red with the blood of all who\u2019s drowned in the waters but really just feels like a peaceful date location, and an abandoned broom closet where Jiang Cheng found dead rats years ago. Not once do they encounter a ghost, but Wei Wuxian still makes Jingyi keep him company as they sit near the docks. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how the corpse head of the general came to be buried under the house, and why he comes out to haunt us every spring.\u201d\nJingyi swats at another fly that has managed to land on his leg. He\u2019s been scratching a particular spot on his ankle for while. \u201cThat sounds fake, like one of those period dramas. How are these bugs not biting you?\u201d\nWei Wuxian drops a small tube on Jingyi\u2019s lap. \u201cUse this! It\u2019ll help. And anyways, I didn\u2019t steal it from a drama. I actually read it in one of Bingbing\u2019s webnovels!\u201d \nJingyi squints at the tiny pack. \u201cWhat is this? Toothpaste? You don\u2019t have real bug cream? Aren\u2019t you a doctor?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes you gotta improvise! I guess you\u2019d rather get eaten alive instead~?\u201d\n\u201cAck! Gimme that.\u201d Jingyi smoothes a dollop of minty toothpaste on his existing bites and frowns. \u201cHow come none of the bugs are biting you? Is your skin too thick?\u201d\nWei Wuxian laughs. \u201cThey\u2019ve had enough of me! You\u2019re the newcomer here with your exotic blood~ All the mosquitoes are clambering to get some of that Lan juice. You\u2019re all so plump and pure and sweet.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a peach ripe for the picking,\u201d Jingyi mumbles. \u201cYou\u2019re so weird\u2026 I don\u2019t know why Han Guang-Jun likes you.\u201d\nIn an act that truly infuriates Jingyi, Wei Wuxian has the audacity to tilt his head in confusion. \u201cLan Zhan doesn\u2019t like me! He just tolerates me because he\u2019s so polite and patient.\u201d\nJingyi kind of wants to push Wei Wuxian into the water, but killing one halves of the pair he\u2019s trying to matchmake would be counter intuitive to his plans. Plus, Jin Ling would probably throw a fuss. Jingyi thinks about what Sizhui would do, and tries to reason with him. \u201cWhy would you think Han Guang-Jun doesn\u2019t like you? He spends the most time with you.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan just goes along with my whims because it\u2019s easier than the hassle of rejecting me,\u201d Wei Wuxian replies, completely serious. The smile on his face does slip a little, and Jingyi kind of regrets offering to play therapist to someone with the emotional comprehension of a rock. This guy is even more hard-headed than a piece of white rabbit candy that\u2019s been sitting around for too long. \n\u201cUrg,\u201d Jingyi grumbles at last. \u201cWhatever. I want to go to sleep already.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna wait for the ghost head to appear? How lame.\u201d Still, Wei Wuxian cheerfully stands up and leads Jingyi towards the living quarters. \nThe walk back is smoother, calmer, as they\u2019re accompanied by the distant chirping of crickets. Lotus Pier really is beautifully peaceful, with well tended gardens and ponds at every turn. Jingyi thinks it must be so idyllic to grow up here. They\u2019re almost in the East Wing when a familiar bark startles Wei Wuxian, and Jingyi turns around to find Fairy happily wagging his tail near a tree. Next to him is Jiang Cheng, looking bored, while Jin Bing sits a few steps away on the stone steps leading up to the rooms. \n\u201cJ-j-jiang Cheng! What are you doing? What is that beast doing?!\u201d Wei Wuxian very obviously steps behind Jingyi. \nJin Bing barely looks up from the glow of her phone screen. \u201cFairy was getting restless and had to pee. I took him out here and ran into Xiaojiu.\u201d\n\u201cMy dog senses were tingling,\u201d Jiang Cheng says seriously as he sits on the stone walkway and plays with Fairy. He seems notably happier to be ruffling Fairy, the look of constant irritation having melted off his face. \u201cWhat are you doing out here? Are you hazing A-Ling\u2019s little friend?\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Lan Jingyi!\u201d\n\u201cThe adults are talking, Lan Jingyi,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. He doesn\u2019t look very intimidating with Fairy licking his jaw. \nWell, Jingyi thinks. Wei Wuxian hardly feels like an adult with the way he\u2019s trembling behind him. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now!\u201d Jingyi declares, if only to have an excuse for Wei Wuxian to retreat and lead Jingyi back. Wei Wuxian takes the bait immediately and latches onto Jingyi\u2019s arm, practically dragging him out of the area.\nStill, this gives Jingyi an idea.\nThe next morning, Jingyi drags his tired body out of bed when Sizhui finally comes knocking on their shared door. It\u2019s National Day, and they find a modest assortment of breakfast laid out in the main living room as the Jiang family scatters around the large low table, watching the Beijing National Parade on the large television. Jingyi takes a strip of youtiao and a cup of soy milk. He takes a seat next to Jin Ling, who makes room and grabs two extra floor cushions for them.\n\u201cDon\u2019t eat too much,\u201d Jiang Yanli reminds them while blowing gently on the congee in Tiantian\u2019s bowl. \u201cRemember, we\u2019re going out for lunch.\u201d\nThe parade is pretty typical and anticlimactic. Madam Yu and Jiang Fengmian discuss the unnecessary opulence of it all while Wei Wuxian makes weird commentary that everyone but Lan Wangji ignores. Everyone has various level of interest in the show-- the twins are amazed by the army drill formations, Jiang Cheng comments idly about terrible Beijing traffic, and Jin Bing just stares at her phone screen through the entire televised program. \nAfter the National Parade ends, Madam Yu makes a thinly veiled comment demanding everyone change into proper attire for lunch. Jingyi looks down at his shirt and pajama pants and gulps when he feels the heat of her disapproval.\nAn hour later, everyone gathers at the main gate. Jingyi, having been bullied by Jin Ling into changing into something more formal, is rolling up the sleeves of his button-up shirt when three separate cars come to chauffeur them into the center of Lotus Pier. There, the entire family step into a three story restaurant already crowded with patrons. They\u2019ve booked the entire third floor, which has an open air balcony that overlooks into the busy merchant streets. \n\u201cGrandpa owns this restaurant,\u201d Jin Ling explains when Jingyi\u2019s jaw drops at the sight. \u201cWe have lunch here every year and stay through the Lotus Pier parade.\u201d\nWei Wuxian manages to wiggle his way over with Lan Wangji in tow. \u201cThe Lotus Pier parade is organized by locals. We never know what they\u2019re gonna include. Last year, there was a blown up balloon of Uncle Jiang whic-\u201d He coughs abruptly. \u201cWhich we all agreed was a poor and rude caricature, and not funny in any way. Nope. Maybe this year they\u2019ll do one of our Master Jin~\u201d\n\u201cNot a chance,\u201d Jin Zixuan says wryly. \u201cI\u2019m not a local favorite. If anything, I\u2019d say you or Jiang Cheng are up next.\u201d\n\u201cIf it was Jiang Cheng, his balloon head would pop from anger!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m about to pop your head,\u201d Jiang Cheng hisses. Next to him, Madam Yu and Jiang Fengmian very obviously ignore this entire conversation.\nJiang Yanli touches her husband\u2019s arm, her smile devious. \u201cWhat about me, Darling? Do I not warrant a balloon figure too?\u201d\nThis stuns Jin Zixuan for a moment before he says, \u201cA-Li. A balloon will never be able to capture how lovely you are. There\u2019s simply no comparison.\u201d His comment sends half the table into embarrassed groans, but the most embarrassing part is how genuine he sounds. Jin Zixuan looks even more pleased when this reply earns soft laughter from Jiang Yanli.\n\u201cHow sweet,\u201d Jingyi tells Jin Ling. \u201cYour parents are still so in love after four kids.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but we all know the twins were an accident,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers, then yelps when Jiang Cheng slaps him on the arm. His comment was quiet enough that everyone either did not hear or chose to ignore him. Still, Wei Wuxian is shameless as always. \u201cLan Zhan! Protect me from this brute!\u201d\nLan Wangji responds by carefully rubbing at the spot Jiang Cheng slapped Wei Wuxian. \nJingyi is immediately distracted by the food after that. The nightly feasts at the Jiang estate feel almost like child\u2019s play compared to the quantity of dishes served this time around. Ducks and fish and beef and pork and lamb, all prepared in a variety of ways that make Jingyi wish he could become one with the table. Jingyi doesn\u2019t know how he can go back to Cloud Recesses after being spoiled in Yunmeng. Maybe he should be the one marrying into this family, if their beloved Han Guang-Jun fails.\nSpeaking of Han Guang-Jun-- Jingyi turns around to find Wei Wuxian putting dishes into Lan Wangji\u2019s bowl again. This time, the items are only sprinkled with a hint of red. Jingyi kind of wants to scream. How can Wei Wuxian turn a blind eye to their dynamics when they\u2019re already acting like a married couple? How can someone who\u2019s allegedly brilliant in his field be so dense? Is this fun for him? \n\u201cChew your food,\u201d Jin Ling reminds him. \u201cBreathe. Stop acting like an animal.\u201d\nJingyi sneezes then and almost spits food from his mouth onto Jin Ling\u2019s face. He\u2019s only saved from public disgrace when Sizhui shoves a cloth napkin in front of Jingyi\u2019s mouth at the last minute. \n\u201cI\u2019m never taking you home again,\u201d Jin Ling hisses, turning a piece of eggplant over in his bowl. \u201cAll you do is embarass me.\u201d\n\u201cSpoken like a true little princess,\u201d Jingyi says, then makes a noise of complaint when Jin Ling shoves a tiny fried mantou into Jingyi\u2019s mouth to shut him up. \nLunch proceeds like any other large meal. The younger kids are restless by the end, causing Jin Zixuan to pick Tiantian up and take her to the balcony to people watch. Qianqian ends up climbing into the seat next to Sizhui, babbling to him about a story she made up about little carrot people. The owner of the restaurant keeps sending complimentary bottles of alcohol up, and Jiang Fengmian leaves to speak with him and all the other tourists itching to get a glimpse of the Lotus Pier patriarch. \nWhen the eating comes to a lull, Jin Bing pulls out her iPad. Jingyi, Sizhui, and Jin Ling take a go at her rhythm games and try to cheat the system by having all three of them tap on the screen at the same time. They come nowhere near Jin Bing\u2019s original score, despite Jingyi\u2019s best attempt at poking at random dots on the screen. Jin Bing then opens a puzzle game, but Jingyi and Jin Ling\u2019s team loses terribly to Sizhui and Jin Bing\u2019s team.\n\u201cClearly we are the superior Lan-Jin combo,\u201d Jin Bing says, which makes Jingyi challenge her to a rematch. He doesn\u2019t get his wish because a loud horn signals the beginning of the parade below them. \nSome shuffling ensues as the twins squeeze themselves to the front, held carefully up by a grandparent each so they can see over the balcony. A quick glance below shows that the rest of the street-facing stores are all filled with people lined up at the front to witness the show. \nThe sound of distant drumming arrives first as they catch sight of the lion dancers. An ornately crafted lion head jiggles and preens and drops its mouth as the first lion dancers move around the streets to the excited cheers of the audience.\n\u201cLan Zhan, did you know? It\u2019s an honor to be the lion dancers opening the parade! Jiang Cheng and I fought for days about who got to be the head the year we turned eighteen! I won, of course-\u201d\n\u201cOnly because you got lucky at rock paper scissors!\u201d\n\u201cPay attention!\u201d Madam Yu chides, effectively silencing them both.\nTwo more sets of lions appear, prancing and jumping and performing stunts. It\u2019s pretty impressive, now that Jingyi knows that the dancers change on a yearly basis and are selected by the parade committee out of all the youths in the area. \nThen comes 24 drums performers, causing the younger kids to vibrate exciting to the beat of the music. Huh, Jingyi thinks, the budget for this must be pretty high.\nThe drummers are followed by folk dancers, the signature dragon dances looping through the streets in golden glory. A group of aunties soon follow, with their long sleeves waving to the sound of folk music. The audience seems delighted, as more and more people appear, crowded on top of each other at storefronts. \nSoon, a group of kids dressed in purple appear with detailed fans. They move messily, but endearingly, to the choreography until all the kids are called back to the center. All of them stretch on cue, their extended fans forming the undeniable shape of a nine-petal lotus.\n\u201cHow quaint,\u201d Madam Yu says, sounding pleased. \n\u201cDid you ever participate in this?\u201d Sizhui asks Jin Ling.\nWei Wuxian pokes his head over. \u201cHe sure did! And I sure have pictures!\u201d\n\u201cNo! Stop it! Pay attention!\u201d Jin Ling demands, face flushed.\nThe procession of balloons are next. Thankfully, there is no caricature head of the Jiang family this time. However, the giant inflated pig is very obviously wearing a qipao with lotus designs. Jingyi is torn between laughing and crying when the pig winks. \n\u201cWe need to consider limiting the funds to this,\u201d Madam Yu says. \u201cThis is getting ridiculous.\u201d\nJiang Fengmian laughs in amusement, with Qianqian in his arms. \u201cOh, San-Niang, but I\u2019m enjoying this.\u201d\nAt the very end of the parade are people dressed up as famous characters like the cast of Journey to the West. However, it\u2019s not until they get closer that Jiang Cheng very obviously says, \u201cOh, no.\u201d\nBelow, someone very obviously dressed as Jiang Fengmian seems to be reacting a skit with another person in red. There\u2019s fake weapons, fake shoutings, and a fake fight scene choreographed until the man in red fake collapses. \n\u201cOh my God,\u201d Wei Wuxian is laughing so hard he\u2019s crying now. \u201cIs that supposed to be Wen Rouhan?\u201d\nBelow them, a maiden wearing purple appears and swoons at the sight of fake Jiang Fengmian. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to have a serious talk with Organizer Fei,\u201d Madam Yu decides while her family bursts into hysterics. Even Jiang Yanli has to hide her laughter in her husband\u2019s shoulder.\nOn the streets, fake Madam Yu has to be carried bridal style by her fake husband to loud cheers.\n\u201cThis parade gets better and better every year,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells a passive looking Lan Wangji. \u201cWasn\u2019t it great? Didn\u2019t you like it, Lan Zhan?\u201d\nLan Wangji says, \u201cI would\u2019ve liked to see you as a lion dancer.\u201d\nWei Wuxian grins immediately. \u201cOh! I was only the head, you know! According to locals, Jiang Cheng is the one with the better ass!\u201d\n\u201cIf Jiang Cheng finally kills Wei Wuxian,\u201d Jin Zixuan tells his wife quietly while Jiang Cheng reaches for Wei Wuxian with murderous intent, stopped only by Wei Wuxian hiding behind Lan Wangji. \u201cIt will be what he deserves.\u201d\nWhile Jiang Cheng\u2019s attempt to eradicate his brother goes on in the background to the annoyance of Madam Yu and the giggling delight of the twins, Sizhui regroups with Jingyi and Jin Ling. \u201cIsn\u2019t Dr. Wei already so close to my Father? I don\u2019t know what to do at this point for him to get a clue.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jingyi says, remembering last night. \u201cI have an idea!\u201d\nJin Ling is pretty sure that all of Jingyi\u2019s plans will always, inevitably, lead them somewhere ridiculous. In this case, it\u2019s with Jin Ling squatting behind a wall as Sizhui and Jingyi position themselves inconspicuously around him, all three of them watching Wei Wuxian speak to Lan Wangji in Grandma Yu\u2019s favorite pagoda on the water. They\u2019re far enough that Jin Ling can\u2019t read his uncle\u2019s lips, much less hear the conversation. \u201cThis is a waste of time,\u201d Jin Ling hisses.\n\u201cPatience,\u201d Jingyi replies while holding Fairy in his arms. Fairy looks excited to be included in their plans and proceeds to lick Jingyi\u2019s chin. \u201cWe need to wait for the most opportune time.\u201d\nIn the distance, Wei Wuxian sets a hand on Lan Wangji\u2019s arm as he laughs. Lan Wangji looks back at Wei Wuxian silently, comfortably. They exude an air of an old married couple, much like Jin Ling\u2019s parents whenever they get a moment of reprieve from the kids. Not for the first time, Jin Ling wonders if they even need to be here, butting into his uncle\u2019s business.\n\u201cMaybe we should call this off,\u201d Sizhui says, voicing Jin Ling\u2019s concerns. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to bother them, and Dr. Wei really seems to be frightened of dogs.\u201d\nJingyi waves him off with the arm Fairy isn\u2019t currently drooling over. \u201cHe needs to get over his phobia anyway. It\u2019s weird to be scared of dogs.\u201d\n\u201cYou were scared of the cockroach in the dorm,\u201d Jin Ling points out, irate. \n\u201cThat thing was coming for my life!\u201d Jingyi snaps. He then goes on to retell the story of a fist-sized cockroach crawling into his stall in the dorm bathroom, all of which Jin Ling has heard more than once with varying degrees of over-exaggeration. \nJin Ling is distracted from Jingyi\u2019s ridiculous storytelling when a small fist pulls at the sleeve of his shirt, and Jin Ling looks down to find big, brown eyes peering up at him. He hadn\u2019t heard the girls sneak up on them at all, but Qianqian and Tiantian now stand in front of him, blocking his view of the pagoda. They\u2019re much more independent than Jin Ling had been at their age. Not that Jin Ling remembers much except the incident about him throwing a fit over a lost balloon that no one in his family will let him forget.\n\u201cGege,\u201d Qianqian says, opening her arms wide as if expecting a hug. \u201cUp up.\u201d\nJin Ling sets a hand on her head. \u201cNo. You heard Laolao. You\u2019re too old to be picked up now.\u201d\n\u201cLan-Gege is holding Fairy,\u201d Tiantian says quietly, pointing a tiny accusatory finger at Jingyi. \nJin Ling doesn\u2019t know how to explain that Jingyi is only holding onto Fairy to stop him from interrupting the next stage of their plan. \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d\nQianqian blows her cheeks up like a goldfish. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Jin Ling insists, even though he already knows he\u2019s on the losing side of this conversation. His gaze lands back on the pagoda. \u201cCome on, get out of the way.\u201d\n\u201cWanna play?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re busy. You can\u2019t play with the big kids. Go find Bingbing or something.\u201d\n\u201cSo you admit you\u2019re a kid, but just bigger?\u201d Jingyi points out with a laugh. \u201cAnd you\u2019re barely older than Bingbing! Why are you acting all high and mighty?\u201d\n\u201cUm-\u201d Sizhui says but is cut off by Jin Ling\u2019s tsk.\n\u201cI\u2019m way older!\u201d Two whole years are nothing to scoff over, even if they\u2019re almost the same height now. Not that Jin Ling has a complex about it or anything!\n\u201cThe girls-\u201d Sizhui coughs. \u201cThey left.\u201d\nSure enough, Tiantian and Qianqian have wandered off hand in hand towards the water. Jin Ling watches, jaw slack, as his sisters interrupt Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji, no doubt asking to be picked up again.\n\u201cWe should\u2019ve just done what they asked,\u201d Jingyi mumbles as they watch the girls tug on Wei Wuxian\u2019s pants.\nWei Wuxian, like the rest of Jin Ling\u2019s family, has probably been given Grandma Yu\u2019s decree about not caving to the twins\u2019 demands. Jin Ling personally thinks she\u2019s being too hard on them. Jin Ling himself had gotten piggyback rides from his uncles even after entering primary school, not that he\u2019d admit any of this aloud. \nStill, Jin Ling watches as Qianqian turns her pleading eyes on Sizhui\u2019s father. He\u2019s shocked when Lan Wangji effortlessly picks up a girl in each arm, like they\u2019re Sizhui\u2019s rabbits instead of little bundles of energy that kicked and screamed after missing a nap. \n\u201cHan Guang-Jun really knows how to turn on the charm, huh?\u201d Jingyi says while Wei Wuxian obviously beams. \u201cHe\u2019s really working that hot single father angle.\u201d\n\u201cJingyi!\u201d Sizhui whispers, scandalized. \n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just giving credit where credit is due.\u201d\nJin Ling feels the beginning of a headache. \u201cThat\u2019s nice and all, but how do we proceed with your plan now? How can Dajiu fall into Han Guang-Jun\u2019s arms when it\u2019s already occupied?\u201d\nAs if answering Jin Ling\u2019s question, Qianqian sticks fingers into her mouth and whistles, loud and shrill. It\u2019s the whistle the trainer taught them when Jin Ling\u2019s parents first took Fairy to doggy school, meant to orientate Fairy and get him to come to them when he\u2019s off-leash. Fairy had responded so well to the training that they started teaching him other tricks.\nUnfortunately, this also means Fairy jumps out of Jingyi\u2019s arms and goes running off towards the girls. Jingyi\u2019s complaint of I got kicked in the chest! is followed by the unmistakable sound of Wei Wuxian shrieking.\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d Sizhui says. \nIn the distance, Wei Wuxian leaps onto the red side railing and flails while Fairy happily circles him in greeting. Lan Wangji steps in to do something, but Wei Wuxian promptly loses his balance and falls out of the pagoda into the pond. He goes down with a splash, to the sound of laughter and barking.\n\u201cSo much for your plan!\u201d Jin Ling hisses at Jingyi. By the time he arrives at the site of the action, Wei Wuxian is sitting in knee-deep water, blowing a wet strand of hair out of his face. The twins are currently making a fuss and protesting Lan Wangji\u2019s attempts to put them down so he can help Wei Wuxian. Fairy, having received a look of disapproval from Lan Wangji, now sits calmly on his hind leg, looking perfectly innocent. Sensing obvious disapproval from Lan Wangji, Jin Ling moves to clip Fairy\u2019s leash to his collar. \u201cS-sorry, Han Guang-Jun!\u201d\n\u201cApologize to Wei Ying.\u201d\nBefore Jin Ling can do so, Sizhui and Jingyi come barreling towards them. Sizhui leans over the railing. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Dr. Wei!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Wei Wuxian calls back from the water. \u201cJust tell Ling\u2019er to get that beast out of here!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a dog,\u201d Jingyi says for the nth time. Still, he\u2019s rolling his own pants up and stepping into the water to help Wei Wuxian stand. When Wei Wuxian half laughs, half shivers, Jingyi squints. \u201cYou didn\u2019t break anything, did you? Do you need Han Guang-Jun to carry you?\u201d\nGreat, Jin Ling thinks sarcastically. This isn\u2019t obvious at all.\nSizhui, having coaxed Qianqian into his own arms, frowns at the implication. \u201cJingyi!\u201d \n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just saying, better safe than sorry! I think Han Guang-Jun should also check him over for injuries later, in private!\u201d\nDoes Lan Jingyi have money riding on this? Jin Ling wonders as Lan Wangji hands Tiantian over to Jin Ling, Tiantian\u2019s arms wrapping naturally around Jin Ling\u2019s shoulder as he holst her up. Heck. She\u2019s definitely heavier than he remembers! \nLan Wangji doesn\u2019t pause at all before wrapping his pristine white jacket around Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWei Ying, are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine~ I\u2019m not a maiden in distress! You don\u2019t have to be so worried!\u201d Wei Wuxian grins before sneezing right into Lan Wangji\u2019s face. \nIn the end, Wei Wuxian is escorted back to his room by Lan Wangji while the boys are tasked with babysitting. Jin Lin supposes that everyone got what they wanted-- Jingyi looks weirdly satisfied with himself for the half-assed plan execution, the girls are happy with being held, and even Fairy gets a treat for his performance. \nJiang Yanli soon finds them huddled in the courtyard and leads the girls away for their afternoon naps. Jin Ling is so exhausted from the commotion that he decides it\u2019s not a bad idea. \u201cI\u2019m gonna nap too,\u201d he says and doesn\u2019t wait for a response before heading back to his room. He doesn\u2019t even protest when Fairy jumps up on his bed and settles happily along Jin Ling\u2019s leg. \nIt\u2019s easy to fall asleep after that. For some reason, Jin Ling dreams that he\u2019s on a boat in the lotus ponds, with Wei Wuxian rowing. \u201cI\u2019m getting married to Lan Zhan,\u201d Dream Wei Wuxian says. \u201cBut I have no money for a dowry, so I must drop my treasure in the water in exchange for money and power.\u201d\nIn the dream, Jin Ling can\u2019t speak, but he quickly realizes that he\u2019s the treasure Wei Wuxian plans on throwing overboard. He makes an escape back to shore, where Jiang Cheng is waiting on the back of a giant turtle. The turtle has a collar around its shell, and Fairy is leading it back towards the estate with the end of the leash in his mouth. Jin Ling tries to follow them towards the gardens, but then his grandma appears and tsks.\n\u201cWhat did I say about picking up the turtle? You\u2019re going to spoil it! Now look how big it\u2019s gotten!\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jin Ling croaks, reaching for the end of the turtle\u2019s leash. His hand lands in something warm. He blinks.\nJingyi is holding the hand Jin Ling has stretched into the air. \u201cNo to what?\u201d Jingyi asks, sitting casually at the foot of Jin Ling\u2019s bed. To his right, Fairy snoozes happily on the ground using Sizhui\u2019s lap as a pillow. \n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Jin Ling drops his arm. He\u2019s vaguely alarmed when Jingyi doesn\u2019t release his hand. \n\u201cWe need to talk about the next stage of,\u201d Jingyi lowers his voice. \u201cThe plan.\u201d\nJin Ling scowls but doesn\u2019t move to sit up. \u201cWhat plan? We should just cut it out already. What can we possibly encourage my uncle and Han Guang-Jun to do that they\u2019re not already doing? Are you sure they\u2019re not-\u201d He waves dismissively, their joint hands causing Jingyi to follow the movement of Jin Ling\u2019s arm like a loose jump rope. \n\u201cI agree with Jin Ling,\u201d Sizhui speaks up from running a hand through Fairy\u2019s coat. \u201cNothing good will come out of force. We should just watch how things proceed.\u201d\nHow Things Proceed is Wei Wuxian sitting so close to Lan Wangji at dinner that they may as well be sharing a seat. Thankfully, everyone is either used to or immune to their special brand of obnoxiousness. Dinner proceeds normally, with Jin Ling\u2019s grandma fussing over the kids eating more while Jin Ling is tasked with pouring alcohol for the adults again.\nThat is, until Qianqian declares loudly, \u201cLan-Shushu is stronger than Daddy!\u201d\nIf Jin Ling wasn\u2019t standing next to Jiang Cheng at that very moment with a jar of chrysanthemum wine in hand, he would have missed the subtle way his uncle shakes, trying to contain his laughter. One look at his father\u2019s face confirms Jin Ling\u2019s suspicion that they\u2019re about to repeat the infamous Ritchie Ren pissing contest of Chunjie 20XX. \nJin Zixuan is silent as Qianqian tells with vivid detail their afternoon adventure. She even claims that Lan Wangji picked both her and Tiantian up in one arm, which Jin Ling personally did not witness. Eventually, Jin Zixuan smiles and gestures for Jin Ling to go to Lan Wangji. \u201cHan Guang-Jun, I must toast to you for taking care of my daughters so well. A-Ling, pour for our guest.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan can\u2019t drink!\u201d Wei Wuxian repeats for the nth time. \u201cI\u2019ll drink for him!\u201d\n \u201cI insist,\u201d Jin Zixuan says, ignoring the way Jiang Yanli is pressing her face into his shoulder to suppress her laughter. Jin Ling is eerily reminded of the family gathering last year in Lanling where his father had loudly argued with Jin Ling\u2019s shushus late into the night, only for Jin Ling to find Mo Xuanyu passed out on the floor the next morning while Meng Yao nurses an obvious hangover in the guest bathroom. Sometimes his father can be even more stubborn than his uncles.\n\u201cHan Guang-Jun, are you really going to reject the honor of drinking with my son-in-law?\u201d Madam Yu asks smoothly, but the implication is obviously there. There\u2019s no way she\u2019ll accept Lan Wangji as her new son in law if he doesn\u2019t drink with her favorite, and currently only, one. \nJin Ling almost feels bad as he dutifully serves Lan Wangji. In his peripheral vision, he can see Sizhui frowning and Jingyi trying to hide his amusement. \n\u201cIt would be my honor,\u201d Lan Wangji says at last. He picks up the liquor cup and raises it towards Jin Zixuan. Then they\u2019re both downing the alcohol to cheers. \nThings almost go back to normal after that, with Jiang Fengmian commenting on how they\u2019d sourced and bottled this particular brand of chrysanthemum wine right in Lotus Pier. Wei Wuxian insists he needs to take a few bottles back to Shanghai, which leads to another walk down memory lane with Jiang Yanli commenting on Wei Wuxian\u2019s unparalleled alcohol tolerance. \nJin Ling is back in his seat when Lan Wangji, who had been entirely silent, stands up. \nThe conversation halts abruptly as everyone looks at him.\n\u201cFather?\u201d Sizhui asks softly, which is Jin Ling\u2019s first indication that something is about to happen.\n\u201cIt would be my honor,\u201d Lan Wangji declares.\n\u201c....Yes,\u201d Jin Zixuan says when no one else does. \u201cYou\u2019ve said so already, Han Guang-Jun.\u201d\nIf possible, Lan Wangji straightens up even more as he turns to Jin Ling\u2019s grandparents. \u201cIt would also be my honor to drink on behalf of Wei Ying. To honor his family.\u201d\nHoly shit, Jin Ling thinks as realization dawns on his grandparents\u2019 faces. Lan Wangji is basically asking for his uncle\u2019s hand in marriage! The entire scene is bewildering and embarrassing. Even Bingbing has put down her phone to focus her attention on the disaster.\nYu Ziyuan\u2019s expression is complicated, but Jiang Fengmian smiles eventually. \u201cLet\u2019s toast!\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Wei Wuxian insists. \u201cI think Lan Zhan had too much, hahaha! See! He\u2019s already blabbering nonsense!! Maybe it\u2019s time for him to go to bed!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s eight o\u2019 clock,\u201d Jiang Cheng says.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s almost Lan Zhan\u2019s bedtime, haha!\u201d He doesn\u2019t wait before attempting to drag Lan Wangji away from the table, but Lan Wangji is immovable like a mountain as he regards Wei Wuxian. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to go to bed, Lan Zhan?\u201d\nAfter an eternity, Lan Wangji says, \u201cIf that\u2019s what Wei Ying wants.\u201d\nJin Ling is gonna die. He can\u2019t watch this anymore, and physically uses Jingyi\u2019s back to block his view of the scene. To their right, Sizhui buries his face in his hands, as if he\u2019s forced to witness something shameful. \n\u201cWhat I want?\u201d Wei Wuxian repeats dumbly. \u201cNo! I mean! You just need to go to bed because you\u2019re tired and it\u2019s late! Right? Right!\u201d He seems to be convincing himself more than anyone else.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees, with a hand firmly on Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist. Then they\u2019re off, heading out of the dining room without bidding anyone goodbye as Wei Wuxian splutters in his wake. \nThey\u2019re gone for a good minute before Jiang Cheng speaks up. \u201cNow I need to drink to forget that. More?\u201d He grabs another bottle and gestures towards Jin Zixuan.\n\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Jin Zixuan says as Jiang Yangli bursts into a fit of giggles. \nTo Jin Ling\u2019s family\u2019s credit, they\u2019ve either brushed off or forcibly forgotten the entire thing by the time dinner draws to a close. Wei Wuxian never comes back, and thankfully, no one comments on it. Jiang Yanli spends a good amount of time whispering into the twins\u2019 ears, which leads to Qianqian running up to Jin Zixuan at the end of the night and throwing her arms around his neck. \u201cDaddy is still my favorite!\u201d she declares loudly. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad, Daddy!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not mad,\u201d Jin Zixuan says, although his expression does become visibly less pinched. \n\u201cThat was wild,\u201d Jingyi says when they\u2019re walking back to the guest quarters. \u201cWho knew Han Guang-Jun would be so forward?\u201d\nSizhui blushes more, as if he was the one who\u2019d just declared his intention to marry a member of Jin Ling\u2019s family. \u201cCan we please\u2026 Not talk about this anymore?\u201d\nJingyi and Jin Ling both shrug, sharing a look. \n\u201cFine,\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cBut we\u2019ll see what happens in the morning.\u201d\nWhat happens in the morning is, apparently, nothing. Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian make no mentions of what transpired last night, and even Jin Ling\u2019s parents seem uninterested in bringing it up at breakfast. Things are essentially back to normal, or whatever constitutes as normal these days, until Jingyi coughs very loudly.\n\u201cI heard there is a hiking trail close by,\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cCan we go for a walk?\u201d\n\u201cWhat hiking trail?\u201d Jin Ling replies with a mouthful of food. He doesn\u2019t like where this is going.\nJingyi raises an eyebrow. \u201cOh? You don\u2019t know? There\u2019s a path up the mountains. Apparently there\u2019s a temple too.\u201d He turns obviously towards Wei Wuxian. \u201cDo you know about it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but it was under construction for a few years after a bad rainstorm destroyed most of the original trail.\u201d Wei Wuxian pauses thoughtfully. \u201cCome to think of it, I haven\u2019t been there in years. Lan Zhan, let\u2019s go check it out! Jiang Cheng and I used to climb up to the temple all the time as kids. I want to see it again!\u201d\n\u201cI want to come too!\u201d Jingyi decides. He volunteers Sizhui and Jin Ling before they get a word in otherwise. \u201cGreat! We\u2019re all going for a walk!\u201d\nJiang Yanli, having observed the scene with some interest, smiles at them. \u201cHave fun!\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know about this anyway?\u201d Jin Ling asks later, after he\u2019s changed into sneakers and is waiting for them in the courtyard. \n\u201cYour mom told me when I asked her about things to do around here! I need some exercising from all that feasting! Plus, think of potential scenarios that could unite your uncle and Han Guang-Jun! Maybe a landslide? Getting lost in the woods? Forced to share a bed in an abandoned cabin?\u201d\nSizhui clears his throat. \u201cCan we please not wish natural disasters upon my father?\u201d\n\u201cForget your father! What about us?\u201d Jin Ling demands. \u201cWhere we do factor into this landslide? Are we in the cabin too? Do we just die?!\u201d\n\u201cSome sacrifices need to be made,\u201d Jingyi says solemely. \u201cWe cannot stand in the way of true love.\u201d\nUnfortunately, true love takes the shape of Wei Wuxian blindly leading them through the newly cleared trail on the east end of Lotus Pier. From the look of things, the hiking path must now be listed in the visitor\u2019s center brochure, because they encounter a handful of tourist on their climb up to the peak. Wei Wuxian almost leads them off the trail multiple times after allegedly spotting pheasants, and Sizhui has to remind them of the markings on the trees. \nOn the hike up, Wei Wuxian tells them stories about forest deities and water guardians that protect Lotus Pier. Sizhui and his father are polite enough to listen along, but Jingyi questions the narrative and plot holes until Wei Wuxian starts going off tangent. \nThe temple at the peak is small, with one main compound and a few incense stations. The groundskeeper recognizes Wei Wuxian and immediately chats him up, leaving the others to roam alone. Jin Ling steps aside when a few travelers walk to the door of the exposed parlor and bows in front of the statue. \n\u201cI\u2019m gonna go make a wish,\u201d Jingyi declares. \u201cMaybe then I\u2019ll ace Math.\u201d\nSizhu nods encouragingly. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can achieve anything with hard work and determination.\u201d\nBoth Lan boys turn to Jin Ling. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Jingyi asks.\nJin Ling supposes he doesn\u2019t lack anything in particular. He used to wish for more toys and more attention from his parents, only to realize he was already spoiled on that front. At some point he learned that it was possible for his family to obtain anything with monetary value, so Jin Ling began wishing for companionship instead. What Jin Ling really wants now is a peaceful vacation, to spend more time with his dog, and maybe for Jingyi and Sizhui to stop dragging him into ridiculous plans. He already got two out of three wishes, and is coming to realize that spending time with Jingyi and Sizhui is not so bad.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need anything,\u201d Jin Ling says at last.\nJingyi hums. \u201cMust be nice to have everything you want.\u201d\nThis makes Jin Ling blush, because being friends with Jingyi falls in that category. \u201cW-whatever! Go make your wish! Like you\u2019re not just gonna make Sizhui tutor you.\u201d\nSizhui just smiles placidly at them. \u201cI\u2019m happy to tutor both you and Jingyi.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need tutoring!\u201d Jin Ling turns away so they can\u2019t see his face heating up. By doing so, he accidentally catches sight of Wei Wuxian watching them from afar. His uncle gives him a very unsubtle thumbs up for god knows what reason, and Jin Ling snorts. \nAll in all, the trek is pretty uneventful and ends with mud stuck along the bottom of Jin Ling\u2019s new sneakers. Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji never clarify the status of their relationship, and everyone else is too polite (Sizhui), weary (Jin Ling), or weird (Jingyi) to ask outright. \nThe rest of the week continues in a similar fashion. Jin Ling spends his time alternating between babysitting his sisters, playing host to the Lan boys, and tagging along on short outings when he\u2019s not eating or sleeping. He goes on morning walks with Fairy and Bingbing, afternoon trips into town with Sizhui and Jingyi, and gets dragged into shenanigans in the evenings when everyone isn\u2019t watching the newest period drama together in the living room.\nJin Ling is pretty sure that Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji have settled into some sort of arrangement, but he really can\u2019t bring himself to ask. Even Jingyi seems to grow bored of playing matchmaker after a while, mumbling to himself about lame domestic adults. \nJust like that, their National Week vacation comes to a close. On Sunday, Jin Ling bids goodbye to Fairy and his family before stepping onto the express train back to Gusu. \n\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Little Mistress,\u201d Jingyi says, then laughs when Jin Ling snaps that he just has something in his eye. \nTheir only reprieve is that Wei Wuxian had to report back to work two days ago, saving them from witnessing a teary parting scene between Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji. Sizhui\u2019s father is silent as always on the train ride back, although he does occasionally stare at his phone. Jin Ling doesn\u2019t have time to worry about his uncle\u2019s love life, as he and Jingyi spend the entire ride back comparing answers on their history homework. Sizhui, being the only one who worked on assignments during break, calmly helps them correct a few answers.\nWith school starting again and the archery club\u2019s preparation for the next tournament, Jin Ling doesn\u2019t think much about Wei Wuxian\u2019s ongoing romance. It helps that Sizhui and Jingyi are equally busy with classes, and the one time they meet up to check on the rabbits, Jingyi falls asleep with a bunny resting on his chest. \nSo really, Jin Ling isn\u2019t expecting to arrive at his standing Sunday lunch date to find Wei Wuxian sighing gloomily. They\u2019re seated at a table in the far back, behind a standing partition that separates them from the rest of the room. That doesn\u2019t stop the other dimsum patrons from looking their way when Jiang Cheng demands, \u201cWhat the heck is going on with you?!\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Wei Wuxian sighs. Something is obviously wrong, because he barely puts any food on Jin Ling\u2019s plate, much less eat anything himself.\n\u201cDid something happen at the hospital?\u201d Jin Ling asks, picking idly at the turnip cake in front of him. \nWei Wuxian shakes his head. \u201cNo. Work is fine.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom,\u201d Jin Ling declares. Which really means he\u2019s going to text Sizhui, who\u2019d gone home for the weekend, for an update. The group chat he shares with Jingyi and Sizhui had been weirdly silent, but Jin Ling hadn\u2019t paid much mind to it, assuming they probably got tired of him after an extended week in Yunmeng. \nThere\u2019s a huge line waiting at the bathroom, so Jin Ling heads back to the table instead. He\u2019s about to step out from behind the partition when he hears Jiang Cheng ask, \u201cDid you have a lover\u2019s quarrel with Lan Wangji?\u201d\nWei Wuxian laughs awkwardly. \u201cWhat? Don\u2019t be silly. We\u2019re not lovers!\u201d\nWhat the fuck, Jin Ling mouths to himself, rooted in his spot. He\u2019s positioned perfectly out of sight to hear the conversation.\n\u201cDon\u2019t pull that shit with me,\u201d Jiang Cheng snaps. \u201cYou two were all over each other last week. It made me sick to watch. Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t hook up.\u201d\n\u201cWell-\u201d Wei Wuxian starts, then stops. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter! It\u2019s not like Lan Zhan has feelings for me!\u201d\nJin Ling\u2019s mouth drops open. The lady pushing the desserts cart gives him a weird look as she passes by, but says nothing.\nJiang Cheng\u2019s voice echoes Jin Ling\u2019s thoughts. \u201cAre you an idiot? Of course he cares about you? There\u2019s been something going on between you two for years. Here I thought you finally got your head out of your ass, and now you\u2019re telling me there nothing?\u201d\n\u201cI told him he should only sleep with people he actually cares about, that we both should. And he got really quiet and-and- we agreed not to see each other for a bit.\u201d\nToo much information. Jin Ling cringes.\nJiang Cheng sighs audibly. \u201cWell? Do you have feelings for him? Are you attracted to him?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I am! Lan Zhang is the most handsome person I know! He\u2019s so talented and kind and thoughtful. Who isn\u2019t attracted to him?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not, for one.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you just don\u2019t know him well enough! You don\u2019t have any experience in the love department, huh?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t divert the conversation. This is about you and Lan Wangji! What really happened between you guys? I know something went down in Yiling.\u201d\nJin Ling knows Yiling is where Wei Wuxian did his residency, but he\u2019s really not old enough to remember what happened around that time.\nWei Wuxian hums for a moment. \u201cThe two years I was in Yiling\u2026 I didn\u2019t think I would make it out of there in one piece.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI mean-I wanted to quit. Nothing was going right. I was in a bad place, barely sleeping or eating, living off pure spite over my placement. I missed everyone in Yunmeng and my life here\u2026 Then Lan Zhan showed up, and then he kept showing up. He was always in town for business, although I never knew what business. Lan Zhan started meeting me at my apartment, helping me clean up, cooking for me\u2026 Eventually he started staying over, and I thought it would be so nice to do this forever and have Lan Zhan with me...\u201d\n\u201cWhere is this going?\u201d Jiang Cheng asks. \u201cSo you enjoyed being with him? What\u2019s the problem?\u201d\nWei Wuxian falls silent. When he speaks up again, his voice is firmer. \u201cHe kept asking me to leave Yiling and to go back to Gusu with him. I was so tempted. I thought I could probably do anything if Lan Zhan was with me, but I couldn\u2019t just leave Yiling! I had duties and a mission there, and leaving would mean giving up everything I worked so hard for. So I said no and told Lan Zhan to leave\u2026 I hated how just looking at him made me soft, and just being with him made me feel like nothing else matters as long as I was with him.\u201d\n\u201cDid you explain why you couldn\u2019t leave with him?\u201d \n\u201cI wanted to, but Lan Zhan didn\u2019t seem to care what the reason was. He just upped and left, and I thought, maybe I wasn\u2019t important enough for him to stick around. But things were just starting to look up for me, and then I got transferred\u2026 By the time I came back to Shanghai, it all just felt like water under the bridge. I wanted to see Lan Zhan again, but then I heard he had a child or maybe got married? I mean, it should be fine for me to see him, but just thinking about him having a family made me so upset. I thought maybe, eventually, Lan Zhan and I could just go back to the way we were\u2026 Maybe we could live together in the countryside when I stopped working, and he could clean and cook for me again? And we\u2019d have no other obligations except towards each other, but we obviously couldn\u2019t have that, so I avoided him instead.\u201d\nJiang Cheng is quiet for a long moment. \u201cAnd now?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I-fine, now I still don\u2019t know how he feels about me!\u201d\n\u201cYou-\u201d Jiang Cheng starts to say, just as Jin Ling jumps out from behind the partition.\n\u201cYou!\u201d Jin Ling points at a shocked Wei Wuxian. He wants to scream. \u201cHow can you not know how Han Guang-Jun feels about you?! You\u2019re always all over him! I know it, my friends know it, even Fairy probably knows it! You two were so disgustingly married! He practically asked for your hand in marriage in front of everyone! Do you know how much of my vacation was wasted trying to set you two up?! How many stupid matchmaking shenanigans I had to endure? You-you-You villain!\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s jaw drops open. He turns to Jiang Cheng. \u201cAre you gonna let him talk to me like that?\u201d\nJiang Cheng takes a sip of his tea. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything that wasn\u2019t true. A-Ling is right. You\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d\nIn an extremely rare feat, Wei Wuxian opens his mouth only to close it, speechless.\n\u201cLan Wangji is besotted with you. He\u2019s been for a long time, as incomprehensible as that is,\u201d Jiang Cheng says pointedly. \u201cThe fact that you can\u2019t see it makes me concerned about your emotional aptitude, but I actually thought that maybe you refused to acknowledge it because you didn\u2019t feel the same way. But here you\u2019re telling me that you\u2019ve been entertaining married, retirement fantasies with him?? Now I know for certain that you\u2019re just a dumbass.\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Jin Ling chimes in. \u201cYou need to make up with Han Guang-Jun!\u201d\n\u201cPreferably before he gets sick of you, but I doubt that will happen any time soon.\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s expression shifts before settling between determined and resigned. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go find Lan Zhan. Cover the bill for me, Jiang Cheng!\u201d Then he\u2019s off, grabbing his coat and heading for the restaurant exit. He nearly knocks into the dumplings cart on the way out, but narrowly makes an escape with an incomprehensible apology.\nJiang Cheng waits until Wei Wuxian is out of sight before gesturing for Jin Ling to sit down. When Jin Ling obliges, Jiang Cheng abruptly slaps the back of Jin Ling\u2019s head. \u201cYou need to watch your language! Show your Dajiu some respect!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! You said I was right!\u201d Jin Ling rubs absently at the back of his head. It doesn\u2019t actually hurt. \u201cAnd you talk like that to him all the time.\u201d\nJiang Cheng glares, but there\u2019s no heat to it. \u201cThat\u2019s because we\u2019re adults. You\u2019re a child and can\u2019t speak to him like that. You\u2019re lucky your mother didn\u2019t hear you talking that way. Now eat properly.\u201d\nJin Ling looks at the amount of food that has accumulated on his plate in his absence and pales. After finishing a small serving of cold tripe, he asked, \u201cDoes Dajiu know where he\u2019s going?\u201d \nJust to be safe, he opens Wechat again.\nChicken Exchange Anonymous\n12:23 PM\nJin Ling: Sizhui\nJin Ling: SIZHUI\nLan Sizhui: Yes? ^^\nJin Ling: are you home with your dad right now?\nLan Sizhui: Yes, we\u2019re just having lunch\nLan Sizhui: I actually need to talk to you about something.\nJin Ling: yeah me too. Just wait.\n12:40 PM\nLan Jingyi: lololol this is so cryptic \n\u00a0\nJin Ling looks up when a waiter comes to refill the hot water in their teapot. \u201cHas Han Guang-Jun really been pining after Dajiu for so long?\u201d\nJiang Cheng gives him a irritated look. \u201cYou think you\u2019re the first person who has tried to set them up?\u201d\nObviously not, Jin Ling thinks, remembering the Cloud Recesses baidu tieba. \u201cAre you fine with them? Since they\u2019re both\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBoth what? Men? Pining idiots? Liable to give me a headache? Be specific.\u201d Regardless, Jiang Cheng doesn\u2019t wait to continue. \u201cIt\u2019s none of my business until Wei Wuxian makes it my business by wasting my time over it. Now eat more food.\u201d\nJin Ling supposes his uncle is right. \nThey\u2019re at the front of the restaurant, Jiang Cheng paying for the bill, when Jin Ling\u2019s phone chimes again.\n\u00a0\nChicken Exchange Anonymous\n1:15 PM\nLan Sisi: Dr. Wei is here!\nLan Sisi: He just barreled in and started ranting breathlessly.

His only consolation is that Sizhui is also here, forced to play host to the incoming stream of reception guests while Jin Ling\u2019s grandparents make small talk with unfamiliar faces.\nJin Ling huffs. He\u2019s still mildly annoyed at his stupid uncle, the stupid elopement, and his Grandma\u2019s insistence on having a stupid reception to make up for the lack of a stupid wedding. \nMadam Yu had had been furious upon learning that Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji eloped on their trip to Taiwan. They\u2019d even had the audacity to make a show of it by getting married in every country possible. Then came the honeymoon to Europe, Wei Wuxian spamming his Wechat moments with endless badly taken selfies of the happy couple. \n\u201cWeddings are occasions for family and friends! How could you even consider forgoing it?!\u201d Madam Yu had hollered at Wei Wuxian during the following family gathering. Then she\u2019d decided that an elaborate reception was necessary. Jin Ling was pretty sure Wei Wuxian had only agreed because Madam Yu insisted on planning it to the last detail, leaving Wei Wuxian with no responsibility whatsoever except to keep his marriage alive until then. \nJin Ling supposes that part isn\u2019t hard, what with the way Wei Wuxian is currently laughing into Lan Wangji\u2019s neck as the two of them greet guests hand in hand. Jin Ling wrinkles his nose. Gross. \n\u201cA-Ling,\u201d Jiang Yanli says, appearing out of nowhere. \u201cThere are more guests.\u201d\nSure enough, Lan Xichen is now at the door, politely depositing a red envelope into the box. Sizhui has beaten Jin Ling there as he greets his uncle. Well, also Jin Ling\u2019s uncle now. His uncle-in-law? Jin Ling\u2019s head hurts just thinking about it. He follows his mother to the door.\n\u201cZe Wu-Jun!\u201d Jingyi is present too, dressed in something probably too casual. He\u2019d spent the last few hours lounging around until Headmaster Lan had ordered him to help Sizhui and Jin Ling. \u201cLong time no see!\u201d\nLan Xichen smiles. It\u2019s weird for Jin Ling to think this is what Lan Wangji would probably look like if he could express emotions on command. \u201cSizhui, Jingyi-- it\u2019s nice to see you again. Madam Jiang-- It\u2019s always a pleasure.\u201d\nJiang Yanli laughs softly. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so formal. I\u2019d say we\u2019re already so close, but now we are actually one family. You already know A-Ling.\u201d\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d Jin Ling says stiffly, and glares when Jingyi snickers at his formal behavior. \nThe happy couple chooses then to join the conversation, Wei Wuxian\u2019s arm still looped through Lan Wangji\u2019s as people mingle around them. Wei Wuxian looks much brighter these days. He\u2019s always been a bit of a people pleaser and played the role fit for someone used to being the center of attention, but nowadays Jin Ling\u2019s wayward uncle looks happy and complacent just simply existing in Lan Wangji\u2019s orbit.\n\u201cBrother,\u201d Lan Wangji says softly while Wei Wuxian goes on a long winded greeting for his brother-in-law, recollecting some event or another from their shared past.\nJin Ling zones out for most of it until his mother taps his shoulder. \u201cA-Ling, please take Ze Wu-Jun to his seat.\u201d\n\u201cThis way,\u201d Jin Ling says as both Lan Xichen and Sizhui follow. He only gets halfway across the room before Lan Xichen halts at the sight of familiar faces. Jin Ling should be annoyed, but he\u2019s somewhat intrigued when Sizhui makes a soft noise of embarrassment. Together, they trail after the man to the errand table. \nLan Xichen is all smiles as he speaks to Sizhui\u2019s relatives? Cousins? Second Aunt twice removed? \u201cLong time no see, Dr. Wen. Nurse Wen.\u201d\nWen Qing seems completely unmoved by Lan Xichen\u2019s charms, a complete contrast to the man next her who looks flustered. \u201cI\u2019d say the honor is all mine. It\u2019s no surprise to see you here.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not everyday I get to celebrate my younger brother\u2019s marriage.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so? You should tell your brother that,\u201d Wen Qing replies smoothly, nursing a cup of tea. \u201cHe sure likes to appear at the hospital and obstruct our work everyday.\u201d\n \u201cJie! I think it\u2019s sweet that Han Guang-Jun visits Dr. Wei and brings him lunch every day! I, um, think it\u2019s also good for the nurses\u2019 morales. And you were so thankful for Ze Wu-Jun\u2019s presence the last time we went drinking with Dr. Wei and Han Guang-Jun.\u201d\nJin Ling raises his eyebrows while Sizhui flushes at the obvious start of another incriminating story about his father.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault Lan Wangji is such a lightweight,\u201d Wen Qing says primly. \u201cWei Wuxian would\u2019ve been able to take his perfect husband home by himself if Lan Wangji wasn\u2019t busy making a drunken scene.\u201d She pauses, then says something surprising. \u201cMarriage is good for them.\u201d\nLan Xichen just smiles in agreement. His eternally pleasant expression doesn\u2019t change even when Jin Ling\u2019s grandmother arrives at the table, her face stern as always. She gives Lan Xichen and Sizhui\u2019s relatives curt greetings while lamenting Wei Wuxian\u2019s inability to entertain the guests. \n\u201cDr. Wei seems busy,\u201d Wen Ning suggests helpfully and receives a scrutinizing look from Madam Yu for it. \n\u201cHan Guang-Jun is too obliging,\u201d Madam Yu says. \u201cAnd to think Wei Wuxian was able to secure such a wonderful match while Jiang Cheng is still tragically single-\u201d\nJiang Cheng sneezes loudly from across the room, where he is speaking to people who look too stuffy to be anyone but business associates. Bingbing, dutifully playing the role of the perfect Jin Heiress, hands him a tissue.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Wangji\u2019s affections for Dr. Wei is not limited to his family background, however excellent they are\u2026\u201d Lan Xichen replies.\n\u201cYes, yes, your brother has no shortage of praise for his Wei Ying. It\u2019s a wonder they ever lived without each other, with the way they\u2019re now attached at the hips. I haven\u2019t seen anything as sickenly sweet since Zixuan begged A-Li to marry him. \u201d Madam Yu makes a dismissive hand wave, but her pleased expression belies her ire. \u201cZe Wu-Jun, let me escort you to your table. We have much to discuss.\u201d Then she walks off with a hand set firmly on Lan Xichen\u2019s arm-- an act that Jin Ling always thought was an endearing habit from his mom that he now recognizes as a power move passed down in his family. \nSizhui just gives Jin Ling a sheepish smile. It\u2019s an expression he\u2019s adopted a lot since his father threw all caution to the wind and began engaging in gross amounts of PDA with Jin Ling\u2019s uncle. \u201cShall we go back?\u201d\n\u201cWork hard, A-Yuan,\u201d Wen Ning says when Jin Ling and Sizhui head back to the entrance. \nThe man currently chatting with Wei Wuxian at the front is vaguely familiar looking. Jin Ling has to do a double take when he recognizes Nie Huaisang, someone he has always associated with his dad\u2019s side of the family. This converging of people of interests is starting to give Jin Ling a headache. He\u2019s just glad his father is away on a business trip and the twins are too busy being preoccupied and babysat by the endless stream of relatives present.\nNie Huaisang is currently accompanied by a woman in pink who looks less like a date and more like a handler. She looks amused at the way Jingyi is currently gaping at her.\n\u201cLing\u2019er! A-Yuan!\u201d Wei Wuxian beams. Somehow, he\u2019s still hanging off Lan Wangji\u2019s arm. \u201cCome meet my old classmates! I haven\u2019t seen them in forever! Huaisang, I still can\u2019t believe you ran into Mianmian!\u201d\n\u201cYes, it was quite a coincidence.\u201d The woman, the legend, baidu user m1@n_2 smiles back at them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for crashing your reception unannounced.\u201d\nWei Wuxian grabs her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly! Of course you\u2019re welcome! And to think most of our original hiking group are all here! Who\u2019d thought Lan Zhan and I would end up together? I seriously thought he would kill me out of annoyance when we got stuck in that cave together, hahaa!\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d Mianmian says. \u201cWhat a surprise.\u201d\nJin Ling has to clench his jaw shut to stop himself from calling out the obvious lie. From the looks of things, Jingyi is struggling equally hard as he tries to hide behind Sizhui. \n\u201cYour kids are quite handsome,\u201d Mianmian adds, apropos to nothing.\nWei Wuxian just grins. \u201cLingling gets all of his good genes from me, of course~ Sizhui is Lan Zhan\u2019s baby bun. He takes after the handsome Han Guang-Jun.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji replies passively. No one bothers to point out that neither Jin Ling nor Sizhui are genetically related to either of them.\n\u201cAnd this is their friend, Lan Jingyi~\u201d\nNie Huaisang chooses then to unfold his handheld fan and hide his obvious laughter behind it. The amused look Mianmian is sending Jingyi also makes sense, for Lan Jingyi is the only idiot who would use a real photo of himself holding a drumstick as his baidu icon. \n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have friends,\u201d Nie Huaisang says cryptically. \u201cFriends who look out for you, watch your back, and investigate your personal life through the internet.\u201d He levels a particular look at Jin Ling.\nWei Wuxian blinks while Lan Wangji gives the Lan boys a searching look. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Nie Huaisang echoes the question back, feigning innocence. \n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nNie Huaisang closes his fan. \u201cOh, ignore me. I was just lost in thought. Now please excuse me. I must find Jiang-Xiong. I believe he owes me some money.\u201d He heads for the other end of the room with Mianmian in tow.\nBoth of them are barely out of earshot when Jingyi bursts out laughing. He runs out of breath and has to use Sizhui as an anchor while Jin Ling does his best to stare through the ceiling.\n\u201cFor the record,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cI know the three of you are up to something. I\u2019m just choosing to ignore it. Oh, there\u2019s my coworker. I gotta go talk to her!\u201d\nLan Wangji waits until Wei Wuxian has run off to turn to them. \u201cSay nothing to Wei Ying,\u201d he warns them placidly, which now explains his willful participation in their matchmaking schemes.\nSizhui just hums as he watches his father leave. \u201cI guess we really weren\u2019t the first people who tried to set them up.\u201d\nAcross the room, Wei Wuxian is laughing as Lan Wangji wraps an arm around his waist. Wei Wuxian beams up with unbridled happiness. It\u2019s a little gross and a little sweet. Jin Ling sincerely hopes that the two of them will never drift again so they can be the last people to bring them together."
