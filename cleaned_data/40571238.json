    "text": "\u201cSo, what\u2019s the emergency?\u201d Green Lantern demanded, looking around at the other confused faces in the room and then back to Flash who was pacing nervously at the front. At least that\u2019s what Lantern assumed the red blur flickering back and forth was.\nThe speedster came to a stop, facing the room with a worried expression on his face. Hands wringing in agitation.\n\u201cWe have a problem,\u201d he revealed at last. \u201cWith Nightwing. I don\u2019t know if we can trust him.\u201d\nA distressed murmur spread through the room. Nightwing was the newest recruit to the Justice League, having only been sworn in last week, and everyone\u2019s experience with the young man so far had been pleasant. He had been good natured and cordial in dealing with the other heroes and efficient and competent in performing his duties. The idea that he might not be what he seemed was distressing to everyone.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Wonder Woman asked, cutting to the chase.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t Batman be here?\u201d Superman asked, taking note of the Gothamites absence. If there were an urgent issue with a new team member it would make sense that their most security-oriented member be present.\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the problem,\u201d Flash told them, looking even more nervous than before.\nEveryone sat up straighter, suddenly far more alert. \u201cHas something happened? Is Batman alright?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine\u2026sort of\u2026for now\u2026I guess\u2026I don\u2019t know really\u2026I just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFlash!\u201d Black Canary snapped. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nFlash took a deep steadying breath. \u201cLast night Nightwing showed up for his first monitor duty with Batman,\u201d he began to explain. Everyone nodded in acknowledgement, having known that the session was scheduled, where the Bat would give the new recruit some initial training in operating the systems and a lecture on the importance of the task despite how tedious it was. They\u2019d all been there.\n\u201cand?\u201d\n\u201cNightwing showed up five minutes late.\u201d\nSeveral members of the team winced. Showing up late to monitor duty was a cardinal sin in Batman\u2019s books especially for your first day.\n\u201cBet he got an earful for that,\u201d Green arrow whistled in sympathy.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the thing,\u201d Flash told them, pacing once more, this time at a normal human speed. \u201cBat\u2019s didn\u2019t even mention it. Just told him to take a seat. Like he didn\u2019t mind.\u201d\nSeveral sets of eyes widened in surprise. \u201cWow, he must have been in a really good mood,\u201d Aquaman noted earning nods of agreement from the others.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not all though.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d hope not,\u201d Green Lantern muttered. Several people shot him warning looks for the attitude but no one disagreed. Flash ought to have a better reason than that to call an emergency meeting.\n\u201cNightwing, he wasn\u2019t just late\u2026he brought Starbucks with him. Coffee and doughnuts.\u201d\n\u201cHe brought food and drink? Into the monitor room?\u201d\n\u201cAnd Batman let him?\u201d\nNow everyone was looking a little shell shocked.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t say a word about it.\u201d\n\u201cDamn.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe Bat\u2019s got laid recently?\u201d Green Arrow joked, earning a few laughs and a smack to the back of his head from Black Canary.\n\u201cIt gets worse.\u201d\n\u201cWorse?\u201d Martian Manhunter prompted.\n\u201cFlash, get to the damn point.\u201d Green Lantern also prompted, far more impatiently.\n\u201cHe brought the Starbucks for everyone. A latte for himself, a tea for me, and a coffee which he handed to Batman. Just offered it to him right there in the monitor room,\u201d Flash hissed, face pale with shock at the memory, \u201cand Batman\u2026he\u2026he drank it!\u201d\nA hush fell over the room as everyone took a moment to process that information before the panic set in.\nSuperman was out of his seat and hovering in distressed little circles. Wonder woman was grasping the edge of the table in front of her hard enough to dent it and everyone else was in frantic conversation about how impossible that was.\nBatman, accepting an unsolicited drink from a new recruit who hasn\u2019t even cleared the probation period yet? Preposterous. It was unheard of. Heck, Batman still wouldn\u2019t accept food from some of the people in that room even now, and they\u2019d known him for years. Though in the case of Black Canary and Aquaman specifically that was more due to their lack of cooking skills than Batman\u2019s paranoia.\n\u201cFlash, you were right to call us,\u201d Superman declared. \u201cClearly something isn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\u201cHe must have done something to him right?\u201d Lantern asked, \u201cMust have known that of everyone on the team Batman would be the most likely to discover if he was up to no good, so he\u2019s done something to neutralise him?\u201d\n\u201cMind control?\u201d Black Canary suggested.\n\u201cHypnosis?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s not even Batman anymore? What if Nightwing replaced him with a copy?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if Batman isn\u2019t the only one? If he got to him, then he could have gotten to any one of us and we might not even know. There could be a Nightwing sleeper spy here right now!\u201d\nThe room was quickly descending into hysteria with every new theory.\n\u201cEveryone, calm down!\u201d Aquaman snapped, realising that someone needed to be the voice of reason right now and for some damn reason it looked like it would have to be him for once. \u201cObviously something freaky is going on and we need to tread carefully but let\u2019s not panic, ok? We need a plan, and since our main strategist is clearly compromised, we are going to have to figure this out without him.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do we do? What do we do?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Wonder Woman decided, earning frustrated glares from multiples sides. \u201cWe need to understand the threat better first,\u201d she continued, \u201cI say we act normal and monitor them both for further evidence that something is amiss. Then when we have more data, we gather together once more and decide how to proceed.\u201d\nIt was a solid plan. Or at least the best plan any of them could come up with at that time, so they all agreed to go along with it.\n\u201cJust make sure to act natural,\u201d Superman told everyone. \u201cWe don\u2019t want Nightwing to know we are on to him.\u201d\n\u2026\n\n Several days later in the Batcave. \n\n\u201cThe team are acting weird,\u201d Bruce announced as soon as Dick arrived, having been summoned to the manor by his old mentor.\n\u201cOh, thank God you think so too, I thought I was going crazy.\u201d\n\u201cWhat have you noticed?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been watching me like hawks. All of them. Not just Hawkgirl. In fact, she\u2019s been the least hawklike of the lot recently.\u201d\n\u201cHave they given any indication why?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Everything was fine one day and then weird the next. Like I was on trial or something.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve experienced the same. The team have been unusually cagey with me lately. Refusing to share information. Cutting me out of meetings. Some members of the League have begun avoiding me and others seem to never leave me alone.\u201d\nSuperman in particular had been on him like a rash; acting nervous and unsure like he was treading on eggshells but refusing to admit anything was wrong when pressed.\n\u201cDo you think something has happened to them?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s unsure at this point. We should keep monitoring them for signs of unusual behaviour until we can determine the cause.\u201d\nDick nodded. \u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d\n\u201cHe called him B!\u201d Green Arrow screeched.\nMartian Manhunter firmly patted Black Canary on the back after her gasp caused her to inhale a spoonful of cereal.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The woman spluttered when she could breathe again.\n\u201cB!\u201d Green Arrow repeated. \u201cThey were sat side by side in the meeting room and when Nightwing stood up to leave he said \u2018Bye B\u2019 and Batman said \u2018bye\u2019 like it was normal. B! B! Can you even imagine calling Batman B? Who does that? And how?\u201d\n\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d Martian Manhunter demanded.\n\u201cWho freaking knows at this point? We\u2019re in crazy town. I just don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Green Arrow paused, attention switching to his wife who had stopped choking and was now pouring a new bowl. \u201cSince when do we keep cereal on the Watchtower?\u201d\nBlack Canary shrugged and was about to take another bite when Martian Manhunter reached across with a frown and picked up the box from the counter, twisting it around for the other two to see the front where Nightwing was scrawled in sharpie.\n\u201cDon\u2019t eat that!\u201d Green Arrow screamed in panic, not that he needed to since Black Canary was already launching the bowl across the room; porcelain, milk, and cheerios\u2019 splattering against the wall.\n\u201cHow much did you eat?!\u201d He demanded.\n\u201cJust a bowl,\u201d Black Canary insisted. \u201cIt was just one bowl. Oh God. Do you think it was poisoned?\u201d\n\u201cOr drugged. Maybe that\u2019s how he gets you? Did Batman eat the cereal? Does Batman eat?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in here?\u201d Flash demanded, appearing in the hallway. \u201cI heard screaming.\u201d\n\u201cCanary ate Nightwing\u2019s drugged cereal!\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know that it\u2019s drugged.\u201d Martian Manhunter tried to reason.\n\u201cRight! Flash, you\u2019re a CSI,\u201d Green Arrow remembered, grabbing the box from Martian Manhunters hand and holding it out towards the speedster. \u201cAnalyse this. Find out what he did to it!\u201d\nFlash took the box as if he was being handed a bomb, \u201cI\u2019m on it!\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cThey hate me!\u201d Dick sulked, dropping down into the second computer seat in the Batcave. \u201cThey stole all my cereal.\u201d\nBatman turned away from the screens and frowned at his son. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cMy cereal. They stole it all. Three boxes.\u201d\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\n\u201cYesterday. It was weird.\u201d\n\u201cWeird how?\u201d\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t just throw it away. They removed it from the watchtower in a biohazard container.\u201d\n\u201cBio\u2026what?\u201d Dick would have laughed at how baffled the other man looked if he wasn\u2019t so annoyed.\n\u201cWhen I found that all my cereal was gone, I checked the security cameras in the tower to see who might have taken it and saw Flash placing all the boxes in one of those bio containers for transporting radioactive substances.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d\n\u201cI know right.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think someone tampered with it?\u201d\n\u201cYou think they are trying to poison me?\u201d\nThe two shared a matching look of concern. If that were the case then maybe Flash was trying to protect Nightwing by removing it. Or maybe he was in on it and then chickened out?\n\u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d Nightwing whispered in distress.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Bruce replied equally disturbed, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to find out.\u201d\n\u201cOooohh, what does this button do?\u201d an over excited voice echoed through the lab.\n\u201cMr Wayne please don\u2019t touch that,\u201d a harried sounding Mr Dickenson pleaded, further adding to Barry\u2019s confusion and drawing him away from his workstation. His boss never came down to the lab; just waited until the reports arrived on his desk upstairs.\n\u201cSo many buttons. Oh, shiny.\u201d\n\u201cMr Wayne, please!\u201d\n\u201cSir?\u201d Barry questioned stepping forward and moving a bottle of corrosive chemicals out of the stranger\u2019s grabby reach, causing him to pout.\n\u201cMr Allen, just who I wanted to see,\u201d Mr Dickenson grinned, tension draining from his whole body, \u201cMr Wayne here has just very generously donated a large portion of funds to our department to update our equipment and has requested a tour of the facilities. Show him around, would you?\u201d\n\u201cWait Sir, I\u2019m a little busy today and I can\u2019t\u2026aaaand he\u2019s gone.\u201d\nBarry let out a huff, looking between the door swinging on its hinges and the grinning man in a business suit now spinning himself in circles on the labs only swivel stool.\n\u201cWhere is Abby\u2019s lab?\u201d the man, Mr Wayne apparently, asked. \u201cCan we go see her?\u201d\nBarry frowned, his usually fast brain grinding to a stop. \u201cThat\u2019s NCIS,\u201d he pointed out.\nWayne blinked, pausing his spinning. \u201cWhat are you then?\u201d\n\u201cCSI.\u201d\n\u201cSo, no Abby?\u201d How could a grown man look so adorably disappointed?\n\u201cNo. She\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s a tv show. You know that\u2019s not real right?\u201d\nWayne was already on his phone, looking up CSI apparently. \u201cOh, I get it. Can you introduce me to Grissom?\u201d\nSo began the longest afternoon of Barry\u2019s life.\n\u2026\n\u201cYou look like crap,\u201d Green Lantern very bluntly pointed out.\nLantern was a jerk Flash decided. Had he always been a jerk or was it a new development?\nDoesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s a jerk now.\n\u201cScrew you.\u201d\nGreen Lanterns eyes went wide as saucers.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u2026I just\u2026had a rough day.\u201d\n\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nMore team members were beginning to arrive so Flash forced himself to sit upright and grabbed a pot of coffee, pouring a generous cup, or three for himself.\n\u201cDid you get the analysis done on the cereal?\u201d Black Canary asked, taking the seat beside him.\nFlash sighed and nodded. Thankfully he had already run the analysis before his unwelcome guest arrived today. Too tired to read it aloud Flash just passed his laptop over to Cyborg to look at, trusting that he could relay the results to the rest of them.\n\u201cAnalysis shows the cereal was untampered with,\u201d Cyborg surmised from the test results, reinforcing the conclusion Barry had already made. \u201cHowever,\u201d Cyborg continued, making the speedster look up in confusion, \u201cFlash, are you aware that this laptop has recently been accessed by a remote scanner?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThey covered their tracks well, but I am detecting evidence that would indicate the contents of this laptop were hacked and then downloaded to an external device.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? When? Why?\u201d What the heck? How had Barry not noticed something like that?\n\u201cFrom what I can see it must have been earlier today.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. The only people who were anywhere near this laptop today were me and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd who?\u201d\n\u201cWell, there was this guy, Bruce Wayne.\u201d\n\u201cBillionaire, businessman, playboy, philanthropist,\u201d Cyborg supplied instantly after scanning the web for information on Bruce Wayne.\n\u201cHe donated some money to my bosses so they asked me to show him around my lab, he was there all afternoon.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he had access to your laptop?\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah, but he couldn\u2019t have\u2026he was an idiot!\u201d\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s just what he wanted you to think!\u201d Green Lantern suggested.\n\u201cYou think he was a spy?\u201d\n\u201cLooking for what?\u201d\n\u201cThe cereal report!\u201d Black Canary cried out, eyes going wide.\nSeveral people gasped.\n\"But how would he know about...\"\n\u201cI just ran a scan of the watchtower security systems, it appears that Nightwing accessed the security footage of the canteen yesterday and saw Flash removing the cereal boxes for analysis,\u201d Cyborg told them, cutting Flash off.\n\u201cSo, he knew we were testing it? What if there was something wrong with the cereal and this Bruce Wayne swapped the report? You think he works for Nightwing?\u201d Black Canary theorised.\nGreen Lantern leaned forward; his expression intense. \u201cFlash, what was this Wayne guy like? Describe him.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, he was\u2026hyperactive I guess, dark haired, fairly attractive, smiled a lot, kind of funny, seemed nice enough, if a bit stupid.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we know that the stupid part was an act,\u201d Green Lantern reminded them, \u201cand if he was after the cereal report then\u2026hear me out\u2026what if Bruce Wayne is Nightwing?\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cAnalysis shows that the cereal was untampered with,\u201d Bruce read aloud.\n\u201cThen why did they steal my Cheerios?\u201d Dick demanded, \u201cand my Froot Loops,\u201d his face twisted into one of anguish, tears gathering at the corners of his eyes, \u201cand my Lucky Charms.\u201d\nBruce could only offer silent commiseration, holding his son close and rubbing his back gently as the young man cried into his shoulder.\n\u201cHe changed the fuck or die contract!\u201d\n\u201cHe, they, what?\u201d Flash flailed around in confusion and Hawkgirl reached out to steady him in concern. Everyone was staring at Aquaman and Cyborg who had just rushed in to the room.\n\u201cCome again?\u201d Green arrow requested.\nAquaman took the lead in explaining.\n\u201cYou remember that form Batman made us each fill out when we first started working together? The one that says in the event that one of us is put in a situation that will cause us to die unless someone else has sex with us\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStill not sure why we need a contingency for that.\u201d Green Arrow muttered.\n\u201cYour chances of being caught in a fuck or die scenario are low,\u201d Superman stated in a peppy voice like he was filming a commercial, \u201cbut never zero.\u201d\nFlash sniggered and high fived him.\n\u201c\u2026and if in that scenario we are put in a state where we are not able to give consent,\u201d Aquaman continued ignoring the interruptions, \u201cthe form will act as pre written consent that the team are allowed to do whatever they need to do.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we remember it.\u201d\n\u201cMost awkward paperwork I\u2019ve ever had to fill out.\u201d\n\u201cWell do you remember the part where you can specify if you want specific team members excluded from this consent.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we all left it blank. Obviously.\u201d\n\u201cI considered putting Batman,\u201d Flash admitted, \u201cCos he scares me. But when I thought about it, I figured I\u2019d rather get it on with Batman than die.\u201d\n\u201cI put him as my first choice,\u201d Green Lantern countered raising an eyebrow when everyone turned to look at him. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s never going to happen, and he\u2019s the only one who read those things. If he was going to make me uncomfortable by forcing me to fill that form out, I figured I might as well return the favour.\u201d\n\u201cNever zero,\u201d Superman repeated.\n\u201cBatman altered his, this morning,\u201d Cyborg explained, returning them to the subject at hand.\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Lantern asked, \u201cWere you just reading through our emergency sex paperwork for fun? Doing some light reading?\u201d\n\u201cA notice of the update was included in the teams daily key notes, as required by protocol 18-G.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come on. Nobody reads those.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was the change?\u201d Superman asked.\nAquaman pulled up the document in question and cleared his throat before reading aloud,\n\u201cI Batman, being of sound body and mind, hereby declare, that in the event that I am by whatever means; be they chemical, magical or otherwise forced into a life-threatening state whereby my only chance of survival requires my engaging in acts of a\u2026you know what, I\u2019m just gona skip ahead.\u201d\n\u201cThank the Lord.\u201d\n\u201cI extend this consent to all members of the Justice League, excluding those listed below; trusting that the persons involved will act responsibly within the bounds of good reason, and exhaust every other possible course of action before resorting to this one.\u201d\n\u201cGet to the point!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m at the point,\u201d Aquaman snapped back, \u201cHere in the exclusion section we have the Bat\u2019s latest amendment. Persons who may not engage in sexual intercourse with me, even for the purpose of saving my life: Nightwing. (This decision is absolute. In the event that Nightwing is the only available person, please be aware that I would rather be left to die) I trust that this wish will be respected.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d Flash asked sounding bewildered.\nAll heads turned to Flash, faces incredulous. \u201cSeriously,\u201d Green Arrow shrieked, \u201cIt means he doesn\u2019t want Nightwing to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know what it means literally!\u201d Flash snarled. \u201cWhat I meant is, Nightwing has been getting dangerously close to Batman right? Crossing barriers in the Bat\u2019s usual defences like they aren\u2019t even there. And now, out of nowhere we get a notice that of all the members of the League, Nightwing is the only one who isn\u2019t allowed to get jiggy with Batman even if he\u2019ll die otherwise. That\u2019s weird right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. That is weird!\u201d Black Canary agreed siting up taller. \u201cWhat gives?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if,\u201d Superman suggested, eyes wide, \u201cit\u2019s a message. If Batman has broken free of Nightwing\u2019s influence just enough to send us a secret signal to let us know that Nightwing can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\n\u201cOr maybe Nightwing is the one who changed the form,\u201d Hawkgirl cut in, her strategists mind working. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s planning to kill Batman and disguise it as one of these Fuck or Die scenarios and has changed the form to cover up why he didn\u2019t help save our teammate.\u201d\nSuperman shrieked in horror and covered his mouth whilst around him the others looked equally disturbed.\nOddly it was Green Arrow that talked them down. \u201cI hate to interrupt guys but, I do have an alternate explanation.\u201d\n\u201cYou do?\u201d Superman asked hopefully.\n\u201cOk, hear me out.\u201d Arrow urged them, \u201cWe\u2019re still investigating the possibility that Nightwing is Bruce Wayne right?\u201d\nThey all nodded.\n\u201cWell, Wayne has a\u2026reputation. It\u2019s possible that this change to the form is because Batman knows about Nightwing\u2019s identity and doesn\u2019t trust him to be\u2026you know\u2026clean.\u201d\nThe suggestion hung in the air before everyone cringed.\n\u201cEww.\u201d\n\u2026\nThe first notice had come in an hour ago and the rest had steadily followed.\nBruce stared at the screen with mixed emotions. On the one hand; he was relieved to see his teammates absolutely did not want to have sex with his son. On the other hand; \u2018what the fuck?\u2019\nNext to him Dick was slumped in his chair looking despondent, \u201cThe cereal thing was bad enough. This is just hurtful!\u201d\nBruce Wayne was having a party.\nHal Jordan was in disguise. The rest of the League had decided to keep some distance for now. Observe Nightwing on duty and see if he did anything suspicious. More than he already had. Hal didn\u2019t like that plan. He was a man of action. He wanted results. It was obvious that the Wayne guy was Nightwing and Nightwing was up to something big if he\u2019d already gotten to Batman.\nSo here Hal was, dressed as a server, mingling with the crowds at this fancy event, handing out flutes of champagne and slowly edging towards Gotham\u2019s richest man.\n\u2026\nBruce Wayne was having a party.\nDiana Prince was in disguise. Despite telling the others to stay calm Diana was highly disturbed by the recent events involving Nightwing and Batman. She was concerned for their mysterious teammate. To avoid detection, she had dressed herself as what she had been helpfully informed was a \u2018gold digger\u2019. To support the disguise, she had then attached herself to the only man in the room actually wearing gold all over his person.\nSo here Diana was, dressed in the most ridiculous sparkly pink dress she could find, wearing a platinum blonde wig and giggling on the arm of the most obnoxious man she had ever met, as they moved across the room towards the object of her scrutiny.\n\u2026\nBruce Wayne was having a party.\nBarry Allen was in disguise. Everyone else may be willing to take their time and wait things out but Barry lived for speed and delt with his problems quickly when they arose. Whether he was Nightwing or not, Bruce Wayne had annoyed the heck out of Barry the other day and had officially made himself one of the speedsters most hated enemies.\nSo here Barry was, dressed as a caterer, setting out plates of food along the most beautiful buffet he had ever seen. Sneaking bites quicker than the normal eye could see and contemplating how fast he would have to throw a canap\u00e9 for it to hit the prince of Gotham in the face from across the room.\n\u2026\nBruce Wayne was having a party.\nJ'onn J'onzz was in disguise. Despite voting to take their investigation slowly, he couldn\u2019t shake the unease that had been building in him since the first suspicions about Nightwing had surfaced. If the League was truly compromised, if Batman was compromised, it could spell disaster for them all. Reaching out with his psychic abilities J\u2019onn was both surprised and not to find a mental barrier in place around Bruce Wayne\u2019s thoughts, preventing him from digging deeper. If that wasn\u2019t proof that the man was more than he seemed, then what was? With his mental abilities of little use, J\u2019onn vowed to keep watch over Wayne the human way. With eyes and ears.\nSo here J\u2019onn was, shifted into the form of a beautiful woman, hanging on Bruce Wayne\u2019s left arm whist another woman hung on his right, prepared to spring into action at the first sign of suspicious behaviour, desperately ignoring the hand creeping down towards his backside.\n\u2026\nBruce Wayne was having a party.\nArthur Curry was in disguise. Batman had offered Arthur advice in his role as King many times as both his friend and colleague; if he was in trouble, then helping him was not just personal, it was for the good of Atlantis. Arthur could not accept the plan to just sit by and see how things went, he had his people to protect. As the king of the sea Arthur had picked up several languages over the years, and with cash recovered from more than a few shipwrecks he was fairly land-wealthy, so it wasn\u2019t hard to pose as a foreign businessman.\nSo here Arthur was, dressed in what he was certain was very fashionable land attire. He had even caught the attention of a pretty blonde woman in a pink dress that glittered like sunken treasure. She seemed to like him, so even if he failed to learn anything new about Nightwing this night might still go well.\n\u2026\nBruce Wayne was having a party.\nClark Kent wishes he was in disguise. He was here in an official capacity, reporting for the Daily Planet. It was times like this Clark regretted not following Batman\u2019s example and keeping his civilian identity a secret from the rest of the team. If Bruce Wayne really is Nightwing then Nightwing would no doubt spot Clark as soon as he saw him. Nevertheless, Clark couldn\u2019t deny he was glad for the opportunity to be here tonight, keeping an eye on the potential threat in the League. Batman was his good friend and Clark was determined to protect him.\nSo here he was, hiding in the corner, ducking behind the other reporters as much as possible trying to stay out of sight whilst using his super senses to covertly watch and listen in on Bruce Wayne.\n\u2026\nBruce Wayne was having a party.\nOliver Queen and Dinah Lance didn't need to be in disguise, they were invited. Of-course they were. In the past they would turn down invitations from the famous playboy, but not tonight, not now they knew his secret. The others may have decided to stay back, play it safe with their investigation, but it would have been foolish of them not to take such a great opportunity to spy on Nightwing. He obviously couldn\u2019t be trusted. Trying to poison people with cereal! Manipulating Batman!\nSo here they were, dressed to the nines and making their way around the room, keeping close tabs on the man who until recently they had thought was nothing but a fool and now knew to be a criminal genius!\n\u2026\nBruce Wayne was having a party.\nVictor Stone and Shiera Hall couldn\u2019t wear disguises, for obvious reasons. Plus, they had watch duty tonight. Both agreed however that Bruce Wayne, Nightwing, was trouble. Someone needed to keep an eye on him and if the rest of the League wasn\u2019t going to take this threat seriously then it was up to them.\nSo here they were, in orbit, watching the Wayne Manor ballroom through the feed Victor had hacked on the Watchtowers security screens.\n\u2026\nBruce Wayne was having a mental breakdown.\n\n\u2018What are they all doing here???\u2019\n\nThe watchtower meeting room was deathly quiet.\nGreen Lantern, who had started sneaking sips of champagne after the fifteenth rich snob had talked down to him and kept going all night, was feeling rough. Even the glow of his own suit was giving him a headache.\nFlash had a stomach ache from too much food. A problem he had never encountered before or previously believed possible, but damn rich people food was rich. So much butter.\nGreen Arrow and Black Canary were both half asleep. They had muttered something about an after party before laying their heads down on the desk side by side and closing their eyes.\nAquaman and Wonder Woman couldn\u2019t meet each other\u2019s eyes.\nMartian Manhunter couldn\u2019t meet anyone\u2019s eyes.\nCyborg and Hawkgirl were the only ones looking normal, if a little irritated, feeling betrayed that they hadn\u2019t been involved in the previous day\u2019s events.\nSuperman wasn\u2019t even there, citing work trouble. Apparently, the Daily Planet wasn\u2019t impressed that they were the only newspaper whose reporter on scene had \u2018ducked out\u2019 of the party before the action started.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Cyborg started, looking around the sorry bunch, \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say Nightwing is on to us.\u201d\n\u2026\nBruce stared at the newspaper, his skull thumping violently.\n\n\u2018Majority of Justice League show up to help when band of criminal\u2019s attack benefit at Wayne Manor. Rumours abound over Wayne\u2019s connection to the heroes.\u2019\n\nAs headlines went it wasn\u2019t the worst he\u2019d ever woken up to, but it sure as shit wasn\u2019t good.\nIt was before noon and Alfred had poured Bruce a glass of scotch without being asked, a testament to just how visibly stressed Bruce currently was.\nAlfred had also poured himself a glass which was an even more dire sign.\n\u201cSoooo,\u201d Dick sing-songed, leaning his elbows on the dining room table and peering across at Bruce with wide eyes, \u201cwhat was it like making-out with Martian Manhunter?\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Bruce groaned despondently, pinching his nose to stave off the headache. It did not work.\n\u201cWhat base did you get to?\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u201cWas there tongue?\u201d\n\u201cShut\u2026ugh\u2026\u201d he huffed, giving up as the young man began cackling manically.\n\u201cI just can\u2019t believe you would\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI thought he would give up sooner,\u201d Bruce tried to defend, only making Dick laugh harder. \u201cHe was supposed to back down and leave.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to update the Batcave files,\u201d Alfred chuckled between sips of his drink, \u201cMartian Manhunter, talents; flight, shapeshifting, telepathy, gay chicken.\u201d\nDick laughed even harder and even Bruce let out a reluctant snort.\n\u201cJust one more question B,\u201d Dick leaned closer, eyes wide once more, evil grin fixed in place, \u201cIf the robbers hadn\u2019t shown up when they did, how far would you have gone with him?\u201d\nAlfred\u2019s eyebrow raised in a way that perfectly conveyed both intrigue and judgement, showing that he was equally interested in the answer.\n\u201cDick,\u201d Bruce said.\nA few seconds passed with no further elaboration and Dick frowned, waving his hand in a go on motion, \u201cYeah? What?\u201d\nBruce said nothing more, just stared challengingly.\nThe younger man blanched, \u201cWait, are you saying my name or are you calling me a Dick?\u201d\nAlfred snorted again and downed the rest of his drink. \u201cHe\u2019s answering the question.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s...\u201d Dicks jaw dropped, \u201cWait! Wha\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Bruce snapped harshly.\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo seriously, shut up.\u201d Bruce shot from his seat, all at once fully alert, body tense and eyes scanning the window.\nDick and Alfred followed his example, both dropping into defensive stances. Dick pulling a baton from inside his jacket and Alfred pulling a small blade from wherever he conceals it. Even Bruce hadn\u2019t quite figured that out despite years of trying.\nNothing moved. Even the air seemed to fall still.\n\u201cShow yourself!\u201d Bruce demanded.\nThe silence stretched on as the three waited, priming for a fight.\nA hand reached through the open patio door and pushed the curtain aside.\nSuperman stepped into the room.\nIn explanation for his being there the Kryptonian offered just one word.\n\u201cNightwing.\u201d\nThis would have been shocking enough on its own, but he was staring right at Bruce when he said it.\nThe three occupants of the manor all shared matching looks of confusion.\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d\n\u201cBut why a teapot?\u201d Dick asked for the third time, sounding utterly baffled.\n\u201cWhy not a teapot?\u201d Alfred demanded.\nDick shrugged helplessly, \u201cIsn\u2019t that bad for the tea though?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small lead compartment, tucked into the lid and encased in a layer of porcelain. Nothing hazardous was ever in contact with the tea!\u201d Alfred dismissed, sounding offended that the quality of his tea had ever been in question.\n\u201cMbpbfh,\u201d Superman said, struggling against the restraints holding him.\nHe\u2019d got as far as saying; \u201cI know you are Nightwing,\u201d and stepping threateningly towards Bruce before a 350-year-old bone china teapot was launched at his head. A 350-year-old bone china teapot that apparently contained a concealed shard of kryptonite.\nNow here Superman was, bound using reinforced chains to a reinforced chair which was bolted to a reinforced floor in a reinforced and lead lined room, lit with red sun lamps, wearing manacles fitted with blue kryptonite.\n\u201cThis feels like overkill,\u201d Dick commented, glancing around.\n\u201cBetter to overkill than underestimate,\u201d Bruce retorted, returning at last with the Superman proof noise cancelling headphones he had gone to collect.\n\u201cDoes he even need those?\u201d Dick asked, \u201cWith the blue kryptonite won\u2019t regular headphones work?\u201d\nBruce levelled him with an unimpressed stare. \u201cWhat did I just say?\u201d\nDick rolled his eyes.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Bruce began, turning towards their captive, \u201cTell me what you think you know.\u201d He removed the gag.\n\u201cWe know everything!\u201d Superman snarled.\n\u201cWe?\u201d\n\u201cThe League. You haven\u2019t got anyone fooled Nightwing! We know all about your plot and what you\u2019ve done to Batman!\u201d\nFrom the position he had moved to, just behind the bound Kryptonian, Dick pulled a face, waving his hand around in outrage at the repeated misuse of his moniker. \u2018What the heck?\u2019 he mouthed silently.\nBruce tilted his head to the side, \u201cAnd what exactly have I done to Batman?\u201d he asked, going along with the mistake for now.\n\u201cMind controlling him! Manipulating him with your coffee and your cereal.\u201d\n\u2018What!?\u2019 Dick mouthed again, waving his arms in a large circle to signal he was silently shouting it.\n\u201cHugging him!\u201d Superman continued, \u201cCalling him B!\u201d\nBruce had to fight not to laugh. \u201cAm I not allowed to do that?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Superman snapped, \u201cThat\u2019s where you slipped up.\u201d He was grinning now. Looking smug. \u201cYou thought you were so smart. Thinking that if Batman appeared to trust you that the rest of us would too. But Batman never trusts anyone that fast! That\u2019s how we knew you had done something to him! We\u2019ve been monitoring you this whole time!\u201d\nBruce pinched his nose, torn between amused and exasperated.\n\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve been outsmarted Master Wayne,\u201d Alfred commented in his usual deadpan, only Bruce and Dick could recognise the humour in his tone.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Superman jeered. \u201cYour plan failed.\u201d\n\u201cAwfully cocky for someone powerless and tied to a chair, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Bruce couldn\u2019t help noting.\nSuperman\u2019s face dropped for a moment then he seemed to rally himself. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. The rest of the team will notice I\u2019m missing any moment now and then they\u2019ll come for you. You may as well give up now. You\u2019re finished!\u201d\nShaking his head in disbelief Bruce placed the headphones over Superman\u2019s ears and replaced the gag, gesturing for Dick and Alfred to follow him out of the room.\nOnce outside he locked the door and turned to face the others.\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d\n\u201cIndeed Sir,\u201d Alfred agreed.\n\u201cOh my God B,\u201d Dick howled, \u201cThis is so funny. You\u2019re so paranoid, that you not being paranoid has made them paranoid!\u201d\n\u201cI am not paranoid.\u201d\nDick gestured towards the ten-inch-thick door of the overkill room. \u201cExhibit A,\u201d he declared.\n\u201cI\u2019m cautious,\u201d Bruce argued petulantly.\n\u201cWhatever the case,\u201d Alfred reasoned, getting them back on track, \u201cthe Justice League are currently under the impression that you are One; Nightwing, and Two; plotting against them,\u201d\nDicks eyes went wide with renewed outrage, \u201cYeah! They think you\u2019re me! How did that happen? Why do they think I\u2019m some old guy?\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\u201cI am clearly spritely and youthful. No way could they think some ancient relic like you is Nightwing. If you tried to do half my stunts, you\u2019d break a hip or something.\u201d\n\u201cI do plenty of my own stunts thank you very much, and I am not even close to being old. I am in the prime of\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAs someone who is actually old and in bloody good shape in spite of it,\u201d Alfred cut in sharply, \u201cYou are both welcome to fuck off.\u201d\nBoth froze in place.\nDick had a hand over his mouth scandalised. \u201cAlfred swore,\u201d he whispered.\nBruce just gaped, unable to process it.\nRolling his eyes Alfred once again took charge of returning them to the subject at hand.\n\u201cGiven the circumstances I feel it may be time to finally abandon the secret identities and tell the Justice League the truth to clear up these misunderstandings.\u201d\nDick nodded in agreement and Bruce was about to do the same when a sly smile spread over his lips.\n\u201cWe could do that,\u201d he said, \u201cOr\u2026\nPause for suspense.\n\u201c\u2026we could fuck with them.\u201d\n\u2026\nThe screens in the Watchtower flicked on without warning.\nThe sorry gathering of heroes, half embarrassed, half hungover and all full of regret from the night before looked up in confusion. That confusion quickly shifted to horror at what they saw. There on the screen was a smirking Bruce Wayne.\nSmartly dressed in a grey three-piece suit he looked like he was heading to work, or a fundraiser, or a tv interview. Not a hair out of place. Nothing that would lead anyone to suspect he was anything less than the sweet, charming guy the public thought he was.\nNothing but the escrima stick casually propped against his shoulder.\nOh, and of course Superman and Batman, both bound and gagged behind him.\n\u201cJustice League!\u201d Bruce greeted with a wide smile. \u201cYour move.\u201d\nThe screen went blank.\nThe Justice League lost their collective shit.\nFlash stood at the front of the room, head high, shoulders back, eyes sharp. He looked over the team before him, like a General, surveying his troops.\nWhy or how he had been elected as leader of the Justice League in the face of this crisis was a mystery even he couldn\u2019t answer. Frankly he didn\u2019t want the job and felt woefully underqualified. Nevertheless, here he was.\nAround the room, various members of the League were watching him attentively, waiting for him to speak, others were glaring at him in anger, tied to their chairs in much the same way Superman and Batman had been on Wayne\u2019s broadcast. Wonder Woman in particular was struggling violently against her bonds. Only the gag in her mouth holding back what prior to the gag being procured, had been an angry and creatively threatening tirade.\nIn another world, with Batman and Superman in enemy hands, Wonder Woman would be the obvious choice to step up and lead the rest of them. In this world, the Amazonian\u2019s plan had boiled down to charging into Wayne Manor; guns, battle axes, and superpowers blazing.\nGiven that Wayne had somehow overpowered their strongest member and outsmarted their strategist, Flash didn\u2019t think that was a particularly promising course of action. Which is exactly why he had taken it upon himself to put the brakes on it.\nFortunately, Green Lantern, Black Canary, Cyborg and Martian Manhunter had agreed with him.\nUnfortunately, Green Arrow, Hawkgirl and Aquaman had agreed with Wonder Woman. Which is why they were also tied to chairs.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Flash declared, taking a deep breath and rallying himself \u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do\u2026\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cHow are we looking?\u201d Bruce asked, wandering over to look at what his second youngest son was doing.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Tim assured him, flicking a switch on the control panel he was fiddling with. An array of lasers spread across the cave tunnel. Tim picked up a spare batarang and flung it into the lasers triggering a spray of darts to erupt from the walls of the tunnel.\nDick who had been trailing after Bruce, flinched back in alarm, \u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cWhen did you install that?\u201d Bruce asked, glancing around the cave in confusion, wondering what other modifications had been made without his knowledge.\nTim shrugged. \u201cWell, since you won\u2019t let me patrol yet, I had some free time.\u201d He opened a file on the data pad he was holding and handed it to Bruce. \u201cHere\u2019s a list of all the security traps I\u2019ve currently armed. Don\u2019t get caught in them.\u201d\nDick leaned over Bruce\u2019s shoulder to look as he scanned the pad, both of them going wide eyed as they got further down the list.\n\u201cHow did you even come up with half this stuff?\u201d\nTim grinned, already moving towards another cave tunnel where another lethal security system was installed. \u201cHome alone was my favourite movie growing up. Since I myself was frequently left home alone. At a certain point I started inventing my own ideas for how I would fight off an attack if I ever needed to. I got pretty creative.\u201d\nIn the next tunnel, another set of lasers, and another batarang, triggered a spray of fluid from sprinklers overhead which was definitely not water, based on the way it sizzled as it hit the ground.\n\u201cObserving the various rouges in Gotham also gave me some fantastic ideas,\u201d Tim admitted cheerfully. \u201cThe Toymaker in particular was a great inspiration.\u201d\nBruce and Dick looked equally alarmed.\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re on our side,\u201d Bruce confessed, \u201cYou would be a dangerous villain.\u201d\nTim scoffed. \u201cI figured out your identities back when you didn\u2019t even know I existed. I would have destroyed you and you never would have seen me coming.\u201d\nAs the boy moved on to his next trap, Dick grabbed Bruce by the arm and pulled him in close to whisper, \u201cTim is very scary. As a contingency so he stays good and not evil, I would like to request that you be very extra nice to him.\u201d\nBruce nodded solemnly in agreement.\n\u201cHey Bruce,\u201d Tim called, waving him over.\n\u201cYes, my favourite child?\u201d\n\u201cNot that nice!\u201d Dick screeched.\n\u201cMaster Wayne,\u201d Alfred interrupted. \u201cMr Kent is becoming restless.\u201d\n\u201cMr Kent is becoming restless,\u201d Dick parroted in a singsong voice, glaring at the butler who merely shot him an unimpressed look in return.\n\u201cDick, stop that,\u201d Bruce told him.\nThe younger man huffed and crossed his arms. \u201cI just don\u2019t see why he gets to be Batman,\u201d he complained for the hundredth time, scowling at the butler who hours after their broadcast to the League, was still fully kitted out in the armoured uniform and clearly loving it.\u00a0\n\u201cBecause Jason isn\u2019t here,\u201d Bruce stated as if it was obvious, only making Dick scowl harder.\n\u201cJay\u2019s going to be so pissed he missed this,\u201d Tim chuckled.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s what he gets for insisting on going to England to study instead of going to Gotham University like I wanted.\u201d It was an old argument and everyone was happy to ignore Bruce even as he continued to mutter about betrayal and just desserts.\nAlfred turned back to Dick, \u201cIf Bruce can be Nightwing then I can be Batman,\u201d he insisted haughtily.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t be Nightwing!\u201d\n\u201cUh, Guys!\u201d Barbara called from where she was monitoring the screens at the Batcomputer. \u201cWe have a problem.\u201d\n\u201cWhat problem?\u201d\n\u201cCyborg found the secondary security system I\u2019d been watching the League on after they locked me out of the Watchtowers primary system.\u201d\n\u201cWhat secondary system?\u201d Bruce demanded.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\u201cI have no control over you people, do I?\u201d\n\u201cNone at all. But it\u2019s adorable that you thought you did,\u201d Tim replied.\n\u201cThe point is, the feed that I have been watching to monitor the League was switched to a recorded loop.\u201d\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\n\u201cAbout half an hour ago.\u201d\nThey all startled in alarm.\n\u201cSensors show incoming,\u201d Alfred announced, pointing to the outside security feed readouts.\n\u201cOh damn,\u201d\n\u201cAre we ready?\u201d Bruce asked Tim.\n\u201cAlmost. I just have to arm the final tunnel.\u201d\nWith that, Tim walked over to where Damian was practicing katanas on the cave training mats and picked the youngest Wayne up by his armpits, walking with him suspended in the air, he set the now scowling boy at the last cave entrance.\n\u201cOk, now we\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\u201cCrazy whacky inflatable arm flailing tube man!\u201d\n\n\u201cCrazy whacky inflatable arm flailing tube man!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCrazy Whacky Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Man!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCRAZY WHACKY INFLATABLE ARM FLAILING TUBE MAN!\u201d\n\nThe announcement blared from speakers around Wayne Manor getting gradually louder and more erratic each time. Half the Justice League were stopped just outside the gates, surveying the perimeter to test for a way in.\n\u201cWhat the hell is that about??\u201d Flash demanded looking around in panic.\nGreen Lantern hovered just above him, eyes fixed on the lawn in front of the Manor. \u201cI think it may have something to do with the army of Crazy Whacky Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Men.\u201d\nA chorus of disbelief went up from the flightless members of the team whose only view at that time was the drab grey stone of the outer wall. The various flight enabled members each provided a bunk up so the others could see.\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d Flash gasped, balancing on Martian Manhunters shoulders, \u201cIt\u2019s us.\u201d\nAnd it was.\nA dozen Crazy Whacky Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Men each designed to look like a different member of the Justice League, flopping and flailing about just in front of the main entrance of the house. A heavy fog of smoke twirled around the things, obscuring the ground from view, and spinning laser lights shot out from the centre of the display in a rainbow of colours.\n\u201cAre we meant to fight them?\u201d Green Arrow wondered from the crow\u2019s nest construct Green Lantern had created to lift him, aiming an arrow at the Batman Crazy Whacky Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Man and letting it fly. The arrow hit the shoulder, but the Crazy Whacky Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Batman continued to flail.\n\u201cWe should find another way in,\u201d Hawkgirl declared, frowning at chaotic bonanza of movement and lights. \u201cThere are probably traps hidden between them.\u201d\n\u2026\nDown in the cave Bruce turned to Tim with a questioning look. \u201cWhat traps are hidden in the tube men?\u201d\n\u201cCrazy Whacky Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Men,\u201d Dick corrected.\nBruce glared in defiance, refusing to repeat it.\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any,\u201d Tim replied monitoring the cameras where Cyborg and Wonder Woman were approaching the first tunnel at the far side of the Manors grounds. \u201cI just thought they were funny.\u201d\n\u201cSo, they could just walk through them?\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cAnd once inside the Manor they would have a straight path to the cave?\u201d\nThere was a thread of underwhelmed disapproval in his tone, Bruce clearly thinking he\u2019d set his expectations too high.\nTim smiled, a slow sly sinister sort of thing, \u201cI never said that.\u201d\nDick took one look at that smile and inched away from the boy in alarm. \u201cHey Timbo, have I ever told you you\u2019re my favourite brother? Because you are. I love you. You\u2019re the best. I just want you to know that. Never forget it ok? Whatever happens just remember that you\u2019re my favourite. And I\u2019m yours. Right? Right? I\u2019m your favourite? Your pal. You would never do anything to\u2026\u201d\nBarbara leaned over and smacked Dick in the head to shut him up, earning herself a grunt of thanks from Bruce.\nOn the cameras Wonder Woman and Cyborg crossed the threshold into the tunnel. Tim flicked a switch causing an armoured door to shut behind them, trapping them inside.\n\u201cShow time.\u201d\n\u2026\nWonder Woman span around in alarm as their exit closed off. She snarled with rage at realising they had been caught off guard.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d Cyborg murmured poking at the slab of metal.\n\u201cYou think?\u201d\nThey faced the dark tunnel apprehensively. Cyborg\u2019s night vision capabilities providing very little help.\n\u201cOnwards I suppose.\u201d\nIn the weeks since Bruce Wayne\u2019s visit to Barry\u2019s lab for his brazen cereal report heist which had first piqued the team\u2019s suspicions of him, they had been covertly surveying Wayne Manor trying to determine what secrets the man might be hiding. Covertly surveying of course meant Superman hovering overhead and taking a look.\nIt was through this they had discovered the tunnels. A series of pathways underground, some of them starting several miles away, all linking back to a cavern deep under the house. A heavy coating of lead prevented the Kryptonian from seeing inside and given that they had been previously trying not to arouse Wayne's suspicions, they hadn\u2019t yet had a chance to investigate properly. Among themselves the team had been calling it the Wing-Cave.\nNo doubt the central hub for Nightwing's evil schemes.\nAnd where he was currently holding Superman and Batman.\n\u201cOnwards.\u201d Wonder Woman agreed.\n\u2026\nDeep in the Wing-Cave Barbara cracked her knuckles and began typing, setting the next phase into motion.\n\u201cLight\u2019s.\u201d\nAll along the tunnel lasers emerged from the walls, spinning and flashing in every colour and direction.\n\u201cCamera.\u201d\nThe security feed switched to show the two captives making their way towards them from several angles.\n\u201cAction.\u201d\nWonder Woman hissed in frustration, squinting against the lights flashing around them, making it almost impossible to see ahead. \u201cWhat the?\u201d\n\u201cWe are definitely walking into a trap,\u201d Cyborg muttered.\n\u201cReally?\u201d Wonder Woman replied sarcastically. Irritation in every syllable.\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cI hate you.\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d been paired with J\u2019onn.\u201d\nCyborg smirked. \u201cNot Arthur?\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t feel like getting all wet and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying you could\u2026\u201d\n\u201cVictor shut up! Can\u2019t you hear that?\u201d\nSomewhere behind the flickering lights a whooshing sound could be heard as a bladed fan spanning the entire cross section of the tunnel switched on. Which would have been worrying enough, if the metal door behind them wasn\u2019t rapidly moving inwards, driving them towards it.\n\u2026\n\u201cUh, we\u2019re not going to actually hurt them, right?\u201d Dick wondered, leaning over Barbara\u2019s shoulder to watch the scary crazy death trap on the camera feed with concern.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Bruce assured him from the other desk, \u201cAt least long enough for me to lecture them about using their teammates real names whilst trapped in an enemies lair and certain to be under surveillance.\u201d\n\u201cClearly the security seminar you hosted didn\u2019t make an impression.\u201d Alfred observed, quickly being cut off by Dick who was still bitter about the Batman thing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird that you\u2019re calling our headquarters a lair.\u201d\nBarbara glanced around them and then back and Dick in disbelief, \u201cIf this isn\u2019t a lair then what is?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfectly functional base of operations,\u201d Bruce argued.\n\u201cOk Dr Evil.\u201d\n\u201cGod damn it!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI should have asked Selina if I could borrow one of her cats for when the team makes it inside. For my evil entrance.\u201d\nHe span his chair towards them and mimed stroking a cat, a wide evil smirk in place. \u201cWelcome Justice League, mwah ha ha.\u201d\nDick bit his hand to hold in his laughter. Barbara rolled her eyes. \u201cJust use one of the dogs.\u201d\n\u201cThe dogs are busy.\u201d\n\u201cWith what?\u201d\n\u2026\nOut in Manor gardens Green Arrow let out a deafening screech as he fled for his life. \u201cGood dogs, good dogs, good dogs!\u201d\nFloating above, Green Lantern watched him run in circles, German Shepherd and Great Dane hot on his heels. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great buddy. Keep running. I think they are getting tired.\u201d\n\u201cI suddenly understand how Charlie and Grandpa Joe felt in the fizzy-lifting-juice room,\u201d Cyborg bemoaned as the moving metal door at their back pushed them closer and closer to the spinning blades. \u201cThe fan. The fear. The gassiness.\u201d\n\u201cThe what room?\u201d Wonder Woman demanded, \u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cNothing. Nevermind.\u201d\n\u201cNo! If your friends have survived situations like this before then you must tell me, how did this Charlie and your grandfather escape?\u201d She dug her heels into the dirt, trying to push back against the door with no success.\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t my\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHow!?\u201d she demanded.\n\u201cBy burping.\u201d\nWonder Woman almost fell forward into the blades as she twisted to look at him in bafflement, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI told you it wasn\u2019t relevant,\u201d he snapped back. \u201cIt was a very different situation.\u201d He decided not to mention it was also fictional, fearing that she might kill him before the blades did.\n\u201cThen why mention it?\u201d\n\u201cI was just making an observation!\u201d\n\u201cObserve a way out of here!\u201d she snarled. There was now less than a metre between them and the fan which was spinning at an alarming speed, almost a blur before their eyes.\nCyborg winced as the door shoved them forward again. The air from the fan was causing Wonder Woman\u2019s hair to whip around, smacking him in the face and he was oddly enraged by this annoyance as he was staring down certain death.\n\u201cAre you sure you cannot shoot it?\u201d Wonder Woman asked. Since becoming trapped they had been running over options to disable the fan. Cyborg had already considered and dismissed the idea of blasting the thing.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure. In this enclosed space we would just bring the tunnel down around us. Call me crazy but I\u2019d rather be fricasseed than buried alive.\u201d\nWonder Woman huffed in anger, seeing no other options available she closed her eyes and raised her sword.\n\u201cDiana no!\u201d Cyborg cried out. \u201cIt will take your arm off.\u201d\n\u201cThen you will go on to save our comrades!\u201d she declared and lunged forward. \u201cFor the Justice League!!!!\u201d\n\u201cNoooo!\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cWow!\u201d Barbara gasped, watching the screens in wonder. \u201cThat was so brave. She is awesome.\u201d Around her Tim, Bruce, Dick and Alfred gave hums of agreement.\n\u2026\nBack in the tunnel an angry hissing noise filled the space and Wonder Woman retracted her sword, the tattered remains of the fan still attached to the spinning central hub fluttered before her.\nAlthough the door continued to push forward, the two heroes paid it no mind, stepping safely through the freshly made gap to the other side of the fan.\n\u201cRubber,\u201d Cyborg muttered tilting his head to inspect the damage. \u201cIt was made of rubber.\u201d He let out a giggle of relief.\nWonder Woman was far less amused. In fact, she looked downright murderous. \u201cI\u2019m going to destroy him,\u201d she hissed, facing back into the tunnel and breaking into a run intent on finding Bruce Wayne and exacting justice for the humiliation she had just suffered. Cyborg jogged along behind her still high on the thrill of not being dead.\n\u2026\nTim turned to Bruce with an amused smirk. \u201cI would hate to be you right now.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d Bruce questioned, for the first time looking a little uncertain, \u201cThese traps were all your idea.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck convincing her of that,\u201d the boy chuckled rising to his feet. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Dick asked.\nTim just smiled as he walked away. \u201cI\u2019m going to get some fresh air.\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cCrazy whacky inflatable arm flailing tube man!\u201d\n\n\u201cCrazy whacky inflatable arm flailing tube man!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCrazy Whacky Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Man!\u201d\n\nGreen arrow breathed a sigh of relief. The dogs were no longer chasing him, the canines apparently unwilling to follow him into the smoky, strobe-light-y, inflatable, flailing jungle. Honestly, he hadn\u2019t wanted to go into it either, but after a full half hour of sprinting in circles with the dogs hot on his heels he was exhausted and it was all he could think of.\nGreen Lantern had been no help at all, claiming that he was allergic to dogs and therefore didn\u2019t want to risk getting dog fur on his constructs. Arrow didn\u2019t even have words for how stupid that was, and even if he did, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to speak through how out of breath he was.\nA cry for help from Black Canary on the other side of the house had drawn the Lantern away at last, sparing Arrow from his useless commentary and distracting the dogs long enough for him to duck into crazy whacky inflatable arm flailing tube hell.\nHe stepped carefully through the smoke, breathing shallowly to avoid inhaling too much of the potentially toxic and oddly popcorn scented fumes, wary of potential booby traps as he went.\nEvery movement that didn\u2019t trigger some sort of attack just made him more anxious, certain that the next step would be the one to bring disaster. Yet slowly but surely, he crept closer to the house. Soon enough Green Arrow found himself pushing forward the front door and entering Wayne Manor.\n\u201cHuh,\u201d he grinned. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t so hard.\u201d\n\u2026\nBlack Canary stood over Green Lantern looking unimpressed. \u201cYou were no help at all.\u201d\nLantern just groaned and stumbled to his feet. \u201cWHAT?\u201d\n\u201cI said you were no help at all.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d he repeated, head still ringing from the scream that had knocked him out of the sky.\n\u201cI SAID\u2026oh forget it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWHA\u2026ooof\u2026\u201d he groaned as she shoved past him.\n\u201cWhere did they go?\u201d Canary wondered aloud, looking around for the masked figures she had seen.\nThey were in the middle of an ornate garden, amidst a wild array of flower displays, shrubberies, and statues. Around them there were many places to hide, too many. Canary had been exploring the path looking for a route round to the other side of the manor when someone had snuck up behind her tapping her shoulder with a stick then darting away. When she had spun about and tried to follow them another figure had swept her feet from under her and taken off as well. Yet another masked assailant had then sprayed her with a hose. It was the shock of cold water that had caused her to call for assistance, summoning the Lantern who arrived just in time to get caught in her Canary scream.\nThe three attackers were now nowhere to be seen.\nShaking his head to clear it Lantern blinked away the spots in his vision and followed Canary on foot, too dizzy to fly right now. \u201cWhat were you screaming at?\u201d\nShe turned to glare at him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see them?\u201d\n\u201cSee who?\u201d\n\u201cThe\u2026\u201d she paused, uncertain how to explain it since she wasn\u2019t sure who exactly she had seen, \u201c\u2026masked people.\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d he asked, glancing around.\nCanary rolled her eyes. \u201cIdiot,\u201d she muttered, just loud enough for Lanterns recovering ears to hear.\n\u201cCow!\u201d Green Lantern shouted.\nShe swung round to face him. \u201cExcuse me??\u201d\nLantern wasn\u2019t looking at her, he was already moving, face panicked, glancing back over his shoulder as he went. \u201cCOW!\u201d he screamed, breaking into a sprint.\nBlack Canary glanced back towards where he was looking and felt her jaw drop, her feet moving faster than her brain already had her following Green Lantern as fast as possible away from the freaking cow that was charging them.\n\u201cWhy is there a cow?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why there\u2019s a cow! Just run.\u201d\nThey ran.\n\u201cOh, damn I need to do more cardio,\u201d Lantern panted, regretting all of the League training sessions he had skipped or half assed, figuring that in a battle the ring would do most of the work. \u201cI am so out of shape.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you fly?\u201d Canary asked.\n\u201cAfter you scrambled my brain? I\u2019m surprised I can even walk straight.\u201d\nHe may have spoke too soon as a new wave of dizziness caused him to veer sideways into a hedge. Canary led the cow to one side then circled back to him. The cow turned ready to charge as she helped the Lantern to his feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\nA few feet along from them there was a small gap in the hedge, large enough for a person but hopefully too small for a cow. \u201cThere!\u201d she ordered and pulled him towards it.\n\u2026\nDown in the cave a new screen switched on, allowing Barbra, Bruce, Alfred, and Dick a bird\u2019s eye view of the Wayne Family maze which Green Lantern and Black Canary had just entered.\nAs they watched, the gap the two had just passed through closed behind them as the hedges shifted, controlled by some underground mechanism.\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Bruce muttered.\nHe was pleased to see Dick and Barbara looked equally shocked. At least he wasn\u2019t the only member of this family who was out of the loop on all the manor\u2019s tricks and traps.\n\u201cTim installed that?\u201d Dick wondered.\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d Barbara breathed, watching as the two heroes moved further into the maze, hedges shifting ahead of them, herding them towards the centre.\nAlfred grinned proudly. \u201cActually, this one was mine.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s controlling them?\u201d Bruce asked, since he could clearly see no one there in the control centre with him was doing it.\n\u201cMaster Jason,\u201d Alfred informed him with a satisfied smile. \u201cIt seemed unfair to leave him out of all the fun.\u201d\n\u2026\nBack in the garden Tim, Stephanie, and Cassandra gathered to watch the hedge maze close on Canary and Lantern, stopping to give Bat-Cow pets for her good work. \u201cThat was so much fun,\u201d Stephanie cheered spinning around in in her purple costume.\nCassandra, decked out in black and Tim in red both grinned back at her. \u201cI understand why Bruce doesn\u2019t want us crimefighting yet, but this is great,\u201d Tim declared, excited that his Red Robin persona was finally getting its debut. The girls looked equally delighted to take their vigilante costumes for a spin at last. Even if it was just to mess with the Justice League.\n\n\u2026\n\nDeep below the manor Superman\u2019s investigations had identified an underwater tunnel leading from Gotham-bay right up into the Wing-cave. As the others had been approaching the villains lair by land, Aquaman had been navigating this tunnel alone, working his way through a series of obstacles including harpoons, nets, and one very strange starfish who had proven oddly immune to his control. The creature had kept him busy for a full hour before disappearing into a side tunnel too small for him to follow leaving the king of the oceans to press onward.\nFinally, after these many trials, Aquaman emerged into a carved circular pool within a dark cavern. Secured to the edges of the pool, he could almost make out the silhouettes of several water vehicles including a speed boat and a jet ski. A door leading to another cavern was visible on the far wall so Aquaman swam to the edge and was about to climb out and go exploring when a loud shriek filled the air and he was being slammed back into pool in a tidal wave of soapsuds and one very shocked Green Arrow.\nThe two struggled to separate their tangled limbs from one another and surfaced again, both spluttering, Arrow due to the unexpected dip, coughing up water and gasping for breath, and Aquaman in outrage at the chemicals that had just been dumped in the previously clean water. Actually\u2026well it was Gotham water so maybe clean was a stretch\u2026but it had at least been soap-free until then.\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d\nGreen Arrow still looked extremely dazed. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026the stairs\u2026I\u2026what?\u201d\nAfter entering the house Arrow had found his way to a cellar area to the back of the manor where a stone staircase led down into what he assumed was the cave below, three steps in, the stone steps had shifted to lay flat forming a slide. A pipe had then opened at the top releasing a mixture of water and washing liquid turning the whole thing into a slip-n-slide that led right down into the very pool Aquaman had just emerged from.\n\u2026\nIn the control room Dick high-fived the newly arrived Jarro on one of his star points then grinned at Tim and the girls who had returned from the garden. He nodded to the screen which had shown Green Arrows epic slide.\n\u201cI can see you were also heavily inspired by Scooby Doo,\u201d he noted, impressed and amused.\nTim shook his head, frowning in confusion. \u201cNever seen Scooby-Doo. I didn\u2019t even know those stairs were there.\u201d\nBruce grinned, pleased that he still had a few tricks of his own to surprise the kids. \u201cThose were my idea. I put them in years ago. Took forever to get the mechanism right.\u201d\nBruce\u2019s proud moment went unheard as Dick, Cass, Jarro, Barbara, and Steph all crowded Tim in outrage, \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen Scooby-Doo??\u201d\n\u201cNot possible!\u201d\n\u201cWe need to fix this immediately.\u201d\n\u201cMovie night!\u201d\n\u201cWe should do a marathon!\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps we ought to focus on the current goings on before we start planning movie nights,\u201d Alfred cut in, bringing them once again to the matter at hand.\nJust as Aquaman and Green Arrow were preparing to climb out of the pool again, the butler hit a switch, causing the pool itself to spin like a washing machine drum, sweeping the two men up in a whirlpool.\n\u201cI love this house,\u201d Dick cheered.\n\"I love this lair,\" Barbara corrected.\nThe student common room at the UCL Faculty of Arts &amp; Humanities held a wide range of entertainment options. There was the pool table, the foosball table, the ping-pong table, the beer-pong table (unofficially), and of course the TV, wired up with a fairly standard gaming system.\nIt was this TV that a large congregation of students were gathered about one rainy evening.\nOne of the International students, an American by the name of Jason Todd-Wayne had commandeered the screen, claiming to have a test copy of a new game his father\u2019s company was thinking of developing as they branched out into the entertainment industry. He\u2019d been asked to play and review it. With nothing better to do in this lousy weather, the students were transfixed.\nAt first glance it looked like a cross between Pac-Man and classic Mario, showing a birds-eye image of a maze with two icons simply labelled as Green and Black moving through it. What made this game different however, was that instead of controlling the icons, the player was controlling the maze, trying to drive them into the centre.\n\u201cMove that one,\u201d someone shouted pointing at the screen, \u201cCut Green off before it goes right.\u201d\n\u201cForget Green, Black is almost to the edge, You need to move that hedge at the top and then shut off that path to the left to drive it back in.\u201d\nJasons fingers sped over the controllers, cutting off Greens escape and then quickly rushing to block Black too. It was a close call with Black almost making it to freedom.\nWith no other choice, Black moved in along the path set out for it, with Jason shutting off exits before it arrived at them, herding it inwards to a dead end where he was hoping to trap it while he dealt with Green. As Black reached the end however, a red button appeared on the screen with a command option.\n*Press button? Yes / No *\n\u201cYes!\u201d Several people shouted at once. Jason grinned. Can\u2019t argue with that.\nHe pressed the button.\n*Water sprinklers activated*\nSpurts of blue erupted from the hedges, spraying Black who appeared to jump up and down then run back along the route it had come from, zig-zagging away. Jason cackled even as several others complained about how Black was getting away.\n\u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d Following the pointing finger, they all looked to the top of the screen where the mazes front entrance was, only to see a new piece enter the game.\n\u201cIs that a bull?\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s meant to be a cow,\u201d Jason laughed.\n\u201cWhy is there a cow?\u201d\n\u201cIs it meant to help us or is it another piece that needs to go to the middle?\u201d\nThey all watched as Green ran into the same branch as Cow only to turn around and run as Cow started chasing it.\nSeveral people laughed.\n\u201cThis game is weird man.\u201d\n\u201cBut fun,\u201d Jason argued.\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s pretty fun.\u201d\nWith Cow chasing Green it was easy to guide it inwards to the centre, so Jason focused more energy on Black who kept trying to double back on itself.\n\u201cTurn that one. The one in the middle. Twist it. That will put them both on the same path.\u201d\nJason grinned and twisted the hedge in question cutting off Blacks exit and opening a path into where Green and Cow were. Once they crossed into Blacks section, they were in the final stretch. Students all around Jason called out commands as he led the two icons along his chosen route. With both icons now moving together he moved hedges rapidly, fingers speeding over the controller.\nAlmost there\u2026\nHe shut the last hedge behind them so Cow couldn\u2019t follow, trapping the icons in the centre of the maze.\nFor a moment nothing happened, then\u2026\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nA new White icon had appeared in the centre with Black and Green, the three circling one another.\n*Boss Battle in Progress* the screen declared.\nA series of pixilated lightning bolts shot in every direction before the screen went blank then flashed.\n*Winner*\nA cheer went up around the room, several people clapping Jason on the back.\n\u201cLet\u2019s play again.\u201d\n\u201cCan I try?\u201d\n\u201cAre there other levels?\u201d\nJason stood up, holding his hands up in a sign of apology, \u201cSorry guys, that was a one-time trial I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? What kind of game is that, that you can only play once?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really early stages. I promise to get you all a copy of the finished product.\u201d\nSeveral people were still grumbling protests as he packed his things away, annoyed that they now had to find something else to do. A small group did approach him as he reached the door however, with few pages of notes on suggested improvements to the game. Jason smiled and promised to pass them on to his dad. Looks like Wayne enterprises really would be branching out into entertainment after all.\nWith a final nod of thanks, he quickly retreated up to his dorm room, he had some live footage to watch.\n\u2026\n\nMinutes ago, in Gotham\n\n\u201cCaptain Marvel,\u201d Black Canary cried out as the caped hero descended into the centre of the moving maze they had been trapped in. \u201cThank goodness you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cWe could really use your help buddy,\u201d Green Lantern agreed, \u201cThere\u2019s some weird stuff going on around here. We don\u2019t have time to explain it all but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry\u2026\u201d Marvel grinned, interrupting him, \u201cMr Wayne has already explained everything.\u201d\nBlack Canary gasped in outrage. \u201cYou\u2019re working for him?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Lantern asked.\nThe caped hero shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cHe offered me wealth and power. Seemed like a pretty sweet deal.\u201d\nIn reality Bruce had been surprised to realise the League hadn\u2019t recruited Captain Marvel to their side. So of course, he\u2019d called Billy, explained everything and offered him a chance to mess with the Justice League. He\u2019d flown right over.\n\u201cYou traitor!\u201d\nMarvel grinned wider, circling above them. \u201cIt\u2019s a dog-eat-dog world Lantern. And you\u2019re about to get eaten.\u201d\nWith that he aimed a blast of lightning directly at the ground beneath the pair, opening a trap door, sending them down, down, down.\n\u2026\n\nBack to present\n\n\u201cI hate you,\u201d Green lantern groaned from his spot in the foam cushion pool.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Black Canary asked groggily.\n\u201cI HATE YOU.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d\n\u201cOh, forget it,\u201d he muttered, leaning back into the soft pit.\nRight before he blasted the ground Black Canary had tried to take down Captain Marvel with a sonic scream. Unfortunately, she had started it just as the trap door opened sending them careening into the cave below, the open cavern had reflected the scream in every direction, including back at them, meaning Green Lantern was hit for the second time today and Black Canary was hit for the first time ever.\nThe two-lay panting in distress, trying to bury their heads in the foam pit as the echoes continued to bounce around the vast cavern.\nFurther into the cave the reverberating scream travelled down into the tunnels causing Wonder Woman and Cyborg to cover their ears in alarm. In the lower caverns, Aquaman and Green Arrow who had finally dragged themselves free of the whirlpool, dived back in to escape the sound.\nSuperman who was still tied to a chair in the overkill room with his noise cancelling headphones was blissfully unaware of anything going on, not even Martian Manhunter clutching his head and vomiting three feet in front of him.\nAt their various stations the batfamily, each prepared with their own set of Canary proof earplugs were equally unaffected, smiling happily as they welcomed Captain Marvel to the cave. The hero looked around with an appropriate level of wonder as he flew down to the command centre.\n\u201cWelcome to the lair,\u201d Barbara greeted, popping her earplugs out now the echoes had faded.\n\u201cVery cool lair.\u201d Captain Marvel touched down, his eyes immediately catching sight of a fridge and rushing over to help himself to snacks.\nBruce frowned disapprovingly as the man-boy all but inhaled two snack bars, \u201cChew your food. You\u2019ll make yourself sick like that.\u201d\nAround him several of the batkids laughed. \u201cDad mode activated.\u201d\nCaptain Marvel grinned at them, \u201cWell, my name is Batson,\u201d he mused, rooting through the fridge again, this time pulling out a Tupperware container and a plastic fork conveniently stored alongside it.\nDick jumped forward and covered Bruce\u2019s ears. \u201cShush,\u201d he hissed, \u201cDon\u2019t tell him that. He\u2019ll get ideas.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the returns policy at the orphanage? I want a refund.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t get any of us from an orphanage.\u201d\n\u201cTechnicalities,\u201d Bruce dismissed shrugging out of his eldest\u2019s hold. \u201cAnyway, Alfred is Batman right now. So, he can adopt Marvel as his bat son Batson.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s Alfred?\u201d\n\u201cThe guy who cooked that risotto you\u2019re eating.\u201d Tim explained.\n\u201cOh? Then I totally accept.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad the food meets your approval Master Batson,\u201d Alfred said, stepping onto the platform, having completed his sweep of the tunnel entrances, \u201cCan I get you anything else?\u201d\n\u201cStop butlering when you\u2019re supposed to be Batmaning,\u201d Bruce complained, earning himself a pretty impressive bat-glare from the older man.\nDick smirked at Alfred being admonished, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t need to be reminded,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s why I should have been Batman.\u201d\n\u201cDick, buddy, sweetheart, son, let it go.\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cPoison darts,\u201d Cyborg read aloud from the labels over each tunnel branching off the cavern they had come to. \u201cAcid rain, flamethrowers, pendulums of death? Jesus what is this place?\u201d\n\u201cGremlin.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nWonder Woman pointed to the last tunnel.\n\u201cGremlin,\u201d Cyborg read, \u201cHu.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is a Gremlin?\u201d\nCyborg paused, thinking it over for a moment, \u201cUh, it\u2019s a little monster I guess, violent, angry, chaotic. Lives to cause trouble.\u201d\n\u201cOdd, I\u2019ve never encountered one of these creatures.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not real. They\u2019re just a story. Folktales.\u201d\n\u201cThen what is in that tunnel?\u201d\n\u201cI dread to think.\u201d\nBruce Wayne was a criminal genius.\nIt seems he knew all their weaknesses.\nKnew exactly what to do to trap them. To trick them.\n\u201cHow stupid can you be,\u201d Flash had scoffed once during a Justice League movie night as the hero on screen made a fatal mistake, \u201cEveryone knows you should never press a Big Red Button, that\u2019s just asking for trouble.\u201d\nWayne had known.\nNightwing hadn\u2019t been present that day. It had happened long before he joined. But somehow, he had known.\nHad known that Flash would never be tempted by a Big Red Button.\nWould never fall for such an obvious trap.\n\u201cFlash no! Don\u2019t press it,\u201d Hawkgirl had cried out in warning as she saw him reaching for the device. It had taken them just under an hour to find a route into the house. Another half hour quietly sneaking through rooms trying to find a route down into the caves below. That\u2019s when they had stumbled on this. This devious room.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Flash had grinned back at her over his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s purple! Nothing bad ever came from pushing a Big Purple Button!\u201d\nNow he was trapped.\nHawkgirl circled her friend in agitation.\nThe wall of screens before Flash flickered in a cacophony of light. Speakers on the walls let out a vicious hum making Hawkgirl\u2019s head hurt.\nFlash stared forward, jaw slack, eyes fixed, not blinking, not moving, not reacting to any of her attempts to reach him. Caught in a hypnotic trance.\nDucking her head to shield her eyes from the screens lest she be caught too, Hawkgirl cursed Bruce Wayne as she moved about the room, trying to find a switch or some other means to turn off the screens. Her first thought had been to simply pick up Flash and carry him from the room, but who knows what damage might be done to his psyche if this strange brainwashing device was interrupted incorrectly. Flash might be lost forever.\nMinutes passed with Flash frozen in place and no luck finding a switch, when Hawkgirl looked to her friend and saw the strange movements he was now making. Though his eyes didn\u2019t move from the screen, his face was contorting violently, his body was twitching, feet shuffling on the spot, hands gesturing wildly, lifting up and down, often rising to touch his face then dropping again.\nHawkgirl watched for several moments as Flash went through each of these motion\u2019s multiple times. It was clear what was happening. He was trying to break free!\nShe had had enough. There was no obvious way to turn off the screens and she dare not touch the fitting speedster. That left one option. With a mighty battle cry the warrior heaved her weapon into the air and swung it with all her might towards the wall of light.\nFrom the corner of her eye, she saw Flash lunge forward, feet moving in superspeed to intercept her attack. Clearly there was an inbuilt layer in the hypnosis that forced its victims to protect it.\nJust further evidence of Bruce Waynes diabolical genius.\nIt was no use however. Flash had speed but Hawkgirl had strength. She brushed him away.\nThe axe hit home with a crash of glass and sparks. The room they were standing in, previously covered in the eerie blue glow of the screens, went dark. Blessed silence filled the space, broken now only by Hawkgirl\u2019s heavy breathing, as the sharp hum from the speakers cut off.\nFlash, at last turned to look at her, though his eyes remained glassy and confused.\n\u201cWhat? Wh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, my friend. You are free.\u201d\n\u201cFree?\u201d Flash shook his head to clear the last of the confusion, \u201cWhat\u2026why did you do that?\u201d he demanded.\n\u201cYou were trapped in a\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat was the last episode!\u201d he interrupted with an anguished cry, eyes filling with tears. \u201cI was so close to finding out who was behind everything!\u201d\nHawkgirl took a step back startled by this outburst.\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\nFlash gestured to the screens; pain reflected on his face at the crater of glass in the middle of them. \u201cThe last episode, \u2018Everything Happens for a Reason\u2019 It\u2019s only the best show ever! I just binge watched the whole thing at 800 x speed and I was just about to find out the reason when you\u2026you\u2026\u201d he gestured to the destruction before them.\nHawkgirl stared back feeling equally outraged. \u201cYou\u2026were watching television?\u201d she hissed.\n\u201cAt 800 x speed,\u201d Flash repeated enthusiastically. \u201cDo you know what that means? To be able to speed up shows to a pace that\u2019s comfortable for me without compromising sound or picture quality? It\u2019s a game changer!\u201d\n\u201cYou were watching television.\u201d Hawkgirl screeched again, outraged. \u201cOur friends are held captive; we are lost in a villains lair and you stopped to watch a stupid show!?\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t stupid! It\u2019s\u2026\u201d\nHawkgirl raised her axe threateningly and snarled.\nFlash took a step back in alarm and raised his hands in surrender, \u201cBut I get your point. Sorry.\u201d\n\u201cFind us a route down to the caves. Now!\u201d\nFlash sped out of the room and Hawkgirl took the time to close her eyes and count to ten, calming the rage boiling inside her. After ten seconds she was feeling decidedly less murderous, just in time for Flash\u2019s return.\n\u201cFound a staircase behind a clock.\u201d\n\u201cLead the way.\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cHold on my friend,\u201d Martian Manhunter coaxed, fiddling with the shackles binding Superman to the chair. \u201cWe\u2019re getting you out of here.\u201d\nThe Martian\u2019s head was still ringing from the sonic scream that just shook the cave systems and he blinked against the flashing lights behind his eyes.\nSuperman struggled frantically against the hands touching him, feet kicking uselessly in place. When his first wrist was freed, he took the opportunity to pull off the headphones and eye mask blocking his senses. Then spat the gag from his mouth. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d he grunted, blinking at the green man.\nMartian Manhunter looked up from where he was untying the second hand and flinched back from the glare being aimed at him.\n\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take the blindfold off before you started grabbing at me?\u201d\n\u201cI was untying you.\u201d\n\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you take the mask and headphones off first?!\u201d\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\u201cSo, I would know it was you.\u201d Superman growled. \u201cDo you know how stressful that was? I thought it was one of Nightwing\u2019s people.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would one of them be untying you?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! To take me to another cell deeper inside this hell hole where they can torment me further.\u201d\nMartian Manhunter crouched before him, face open and concerned. \u201cTorment you further? What have they done to you?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026nothing yet,\u201d Superman admitted breaking eye contact, \u201cBut, they could have been starting now and you\u2026uh forget it. Just get me out of here already.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you angry with me?\u201d Martin Manhunter demanded, echoing Superman\u2019s frustration back at him. He yanked at the ankle shackles. \u201cI\u2019m here to rescue you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a very stressful day, ok?\u201d\n\u201cWe all have.\u201d\n\u201cJust get me out of here.\u201d\n\u201cI was trying until you started berating me,\u201d the Martian grumbled, returning to his task.\nFinally, Superman was free, save for a band around his left wrist which kept a chunk of blue kryptonite pressed to his skin, dulling his powers. Despite their best efforts, nether alien was able to remove it.\nIn the quiet of the room, Martian Manhunter caught Superman up on the rescue plan that was underway. \u201cThe League have the place surrounded,\u201d he assured the other. \u201cWe will soon have Nightwing and his minions apprehended.\u201d\nPhasing through the door to open it from the outside, setting Superman free, Martian Manhunter glanced down the hall looking for any other holding cells. \u201cWhere are they keeping Batman?\u201d\nSuperman pushed out of the overkill room with a wide-eyed look of alarm on his face. \u201cThey have Batman?!\u201d\n\u2026\nGreen Arrow floated on his back, letting the whirlpool drag him in circles. He gazed up at the cave roof in a daze, mind reduced to jelly by the combination of the sonic scream, multiple dips underwater, and the constant spinning. \u201cI think I might be Atlantean,\u201d he muttered, \u201cThis is my home now. I am one with the water. The water is I.\u201d\nFrom the other side of the pool Aquaman glared at him in irritation. \u201cI am going to drown you.\u201d\n\u201cYou cannot drown the water.\u201d\nEyes fixed on the tunnel in front of him to ensure another slippy slide of doom wasn\u2019t about to smack him in the face Aquaman concentrated his energy on the water surrounding them and lifted himself and Green Arrow out of the pool, depositing them on the rocky edge of the cave. Once out Green Arrow flopped about like a fish in a panic and tried to wriggle back over into the pool until Aquaman kicked him in the ribs far more gently than he wanted to.\n\u201cYou are a land dweller. Stand.\u201d\n\u201cStand?\u201d Sitting upright Green Arrow grasped at his own legs in astonishment, \u201cLeg\u2019s! I have legs,\u201d he cried, then gasped. \u201cI have to kiss the prince before the sea-witch steals my voice!\u201d\nAquaman wasn\u2019t sure what the other man was talking about but keen to get them moving he decided to roll with it. \u201cThe prince is this way,\u201d he coaxed beginning to walk into the tunnel leading out of there. \u201cFollow me.\u201d\nGreen Arrow climbed onto shaking feet and stumbled behind him. \u201cSha-la-la-la don\u2019t be shy, hey do you know a Jamaican crab?\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cGet your hand out of my face.\u201d\n\u201cGet your foot out of my crotch.\u201d\n\u201cI am nowhere near your\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDamn it my legs are stuck.\u201d\n\u201cStop trying to walk. Crawl up. Try to balance on the top and roll towards the edge.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m trying to do?\u201d Black Canary demanded. She grabbed the nearest foam block and flung it somewhere in the direction of Green Lantern. \u201cCan\u2019t you build a construct to get us out of here? Stairs? A rope?\u201d\n\u201cAfter you banshee blasted me twice in as many hours? You\u2019re lucky I haven\u2019t vomited all over you!\u201d\n\u201cUgh, these foam blocks are like quicksand. It\u2019s like they are dragging me back in.\u201d\n\u201cI think this is a black hole of foam,\u201d Green Lantern grunted as he got close to the edge and the wall of foam before him toppled sending him sliding back to the middle.\nJust outside the pit, a dark patch of shadow moved ominously. With a soft thud the end of a rope landed between the two trapped heroes, its other end extending out into the darkness, disappearing beyond sight. Black Canary and Green Lantern eyed it wearily.\n\u201cDo we\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJust go for it,\u201d Black Canary decided, grabbing the rope and dragging herself towards the edge, \u201cEven if this is a trap, at least we will be back on solid ground again.\u201d\nGreen Lantern shrugged and grabbed the rope as well, following behind her.\n\u2026\n\u201cHey! You\u2019re electric too, right?\u201d Captain Marvel grinned, floating down to land on the metal platform where a young boy was crouching dressed in yellow.\nThe boy turned to face him, grinning wildly. \u201cYou\u2019re Captain Marvel,\u201d he noted excitedly. \u201cI\u2019m Signal.\u201d\n\u201cBilly,\u201d Marvel introduced holding up his hand for a high five.\n\u201cDuke,\u201d the other boy responded. \u201cAnd, to answer your question, I\u2019m not electric, though I can redistribute light energy.\u201d He met the high five with his own hand and added a jolt of energy as he did.\nMarvel laughed at the zap that ran up his arm. \u201cClose enough,\u201d he grinned, pointing to the yellow bolt on his own costume. \u201cWe can be lightning buddies.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Duke cheered in response.\nBelow their feet the metal platform rattled and from the staircase leading up to the house a new figure arrived. Dressed in red with a lightning bold motif in the middle.\nCaptain Marvel and Signal shared a mischievous grin then both cried out, \u201cLightning buddies!\u201d and promptly blasted Flash off the platform into a net below.\n\u2026\n\u201cYelp, yelp, gob, yulp.\u201d\nWonder Woman jumped back, her eyes wide and sword drawn, ready to face any adversary that dared challenge her. From the dark tunnel in front of her a creature emerged. It peered up with its beady little eyes.\n\u201cIs this the gremlin?\u201d she asked.\nCyborg leaned to peer around her at the fearsome opponent she held at sword point. He raised his eyebrows judgmentally.\n\u201cThat is clearly a turkey.\u201d\nGritting her teeth in frustration Wonder Woman twisted to snarl at him over her shoulder. \u201cI know what it looks like but I know nothing of these gremlin creatures. They may be able to change shape.\u201d\n\u201cI told you gremlins are not real.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet this tunnel supposedly houses one. Now are you certain it is not this creature?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I am sure the turkey is not a\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTchh.\u201d\nCyborg and Wonder Woman both froze at the sound which had inexplicably come from behind them.\nAs one they turned, looking back into the darkness they had just come from to find another small creature standing. This one was not a turkey. It was short, masked, wore a sinister smile, and carried a very sharp looking katana. It almost looked like a child. If not for the unsettling aura around it.\n\u201cYou dare threaten Jerry?!\u201d the creature challenged, stepping closer.\n\u201cGremlin,\u201d Cyborg whispered.\nWonder Woman glanced towards him, \u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe question fell on empty air. Cyborg had already turned once again and began to run, past the turkey, deeper into the cave tunnel. \u201cGREMLIN!\u201d\n\u201cHaayaahhh,\u201d the gremlin roared in an angry battle cry, charging at the Amazonian.\nAs a warrior Wonder Woman believed in facing opponents head on. As a tactician she knew better than to face an unknown assailant alone in closed quarters. She didn\u2019t know what the gremlin could do, but she knew she couldn\u2019t fight properly in this closed tunnel. The gremlin, it seemed had no such limitations.\nIn the interests of strategy, she followed Cyborg\u2019s lead. She dodged past the turkey. She ran.\n\u2026\nDown the metal staircase behind the grandfather clock, Hawkgirl made her descent. At first she was frustrated when Flash sped ahead of her but soon her limitation became an advantage as the speedster ran into trouble in the form of Captain Marvel and an unidentified figure in yellow.\nHawkgirl observed their assault on her teammate from her vantagepoint higher up the staircase. She felt less sympathy for Flash as he toppled down to the cave below than she would have earlier before he stopped in the middle of their recue operation to watch tv.\nDucking to be sure the two assailants below didn\u2019t spot her, Hawkgirl hid in the shadows of the cave until the coast was clear then dived over the railing and extended her wings, gliding down the back of a life-sized t-rex figurine and making her way through the darkness to the centre of the cave where she could hear voices.\n\u2026\n\u201cBatman!\u201d\nSuperman gasped in shock at seeing his fearsome teammate in such a vulnerable position.\nWith Superman\u2019s powers still being repressed it had taken the two aliens several minutes of searching to find their still captive teammate, all the while doing their best to avoid whatever cameras or alarms Wayne was likely to have in place. They had eventually found the vigilante in much the same position Superman had been in, tied to a chair, bound, gagged, ears plugged, unable to move.\nWith a pointed look towards Martian Manhunter, Superman reached out to first remove the blindfold and headphones speaking gently to their teammate. \u201cBatman, it\u2019s us, we\u2019re here to get you out.\u201d\nMartian Manhunter rolled his eyes and began working on the shackles.\n\u201cBatman, what happened?\u201d Superman asked as he pulled the gag away, \u201cHow did Wayne capture you?\u201d\n\u201cHe set a trap,\u201d the vigilante explained in his familiar gravely tones. If there was any slight difference from usual in his tone or pitch then the two aliens each simply put it down to their own altered hearing; Superman from the kryptonite and Martian Manhunter from the Canary scream that had echoed the walls a short time ago. \u201cHe tricked me,\u201d Batman continued, ducking his head in shame, \u201cI thought I could trust him but he was...\u201d\n\u201cShhh,\u201d Superman cut him off, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. He was a skilled manipulator. Almost fooled us all.\u201d\nBut didn\u2019t, The Kryptonian smirked internally, pleased with himself that for once it was Batman who had been caught out, while the rest of them saw through Nightwing\u2019s charade. The vigilante must be livid. There would be time to gloat later though. For now they had a criminal mastermind to deal with.\n\u201cCan you stand?\u201d Martian Manhunter asked as the other man was freed.\nBatman responded by neatly leaping to his feet, rolling his shoulders to ease any tension and starting towards the door. \u201cCome on,\u201d he ordered, taking charge. \u201cI know what Wayne is planning, we need to move fast.\u201d\n\u2026\nIn the main chamber the rest of the Batfamily and guests, were poised and ready, cameras had been shut down. Weapons were in hand. They formed a circle around the edge of the main platform, watching every entrance. Waiting.\nOne by one the Justice League appeared, emerging from doorways, and tunnels, and stairwells, and alcoves. Flash, after much struggling, wrestled his way out of his net and dropped down to the floor.\nIn the middle of the platform Bruce Wayne stood, arms outstretched and smile wide.\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d he greeted, nodding to each hero in turn. \u201cWelcome to my humble abode. I\u2019m so glad you all finally made it. Now, let\u2019s get this party started, shall we?\u201d\nBruce Wayne was having the time of his life.\nHe couldn\u2019t remember when he\u2019d last had this much fun.\nAll around him he could see his kids playing happily. Working together. Laughing and joking.\nTormenting the shit out of the Justice League.\nIt was a good day.\nBruce himself squared off against Martian Manhunter, the two of them locked in a battle of mind and body; the alien trying to bombard Bruce\u2019s mental barriers in between punches. Bruce could feel it tingling in his temples and knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold him off forever but for now it was easy enough to push back.\nOver by the cave\u2019s gym, a still groggy Superman was teamed up with Batman to fight Dick. Since the League still believed Bruce was Nightwing the younger man had needed a different disguise for the showdown, which is why he was now wearing an atrocious costume that looked like disco fever gone wrong with its gold details and high collar in electric blue. The fashion monstrosity had been his original Nightwing design before the rest of the family had vetoed it and talked him into the simpler black and blue costume he finally settled on.\nSuperman, bless his heart, was still weak from the red sun lamps and blue kryptonite exposure. Despite trying his best to join in the fight he was hanging back a lot and relying heavily on Batman to fight off their opponent. Unfortunately for him Batman was the one keeping him weak, with a shard of blue kryptonite in the pocket of his utility belt. The trusting hero didn\u2019t suspect for a moment that he was being duped by his most trusted ally.\nIt wasn\u2019t surprising he was fooled; Dick and Alfred were putting on a good show; mostly because Dick was not holding back much, instead making Alfred work for it. \u201cIf he wants to be Batman then he can earn it!\u201d he\u2019d declared earlier, to which Alfred had smugly responded \u201cBring it on!\u201d\nThe older man was admirably holding his own.\nDown in the lower levels, Jarro and Aquaman were circling like sharks, each sizing the other up. Aquaman was struggling to understand the little star. Based on its appearance he tried to use his ability to control sea life, convinced that the thing must belong to his domain, but it responded by releasing a spray of spores that latched onto his face and chest, trying in turn to control him. The two were equally matched, their wills each fighting for control.\nIt was unclear at this point if Wonder Woman and Damian were fighting or playing, both of them clashing swords in a violent barrage and laughing manically like a pair of demons. \u201cYou are a fine opponent,\u201d the warrior praised, parrying Damian\u2019s strike. \u201cYou are adequate,\u201d this child responded earning an enraged battle cry as Wonder Woman charged him. Only Bruce's conviction that Diana wouldn\u2019t hurt a child kept him from abandoning his own fight and running over to intervene.\nSo far, Hawkgirl staying out of the fighting. The warrior in her conceding this once to the strategist. Observing the chaos from above and awaiting her moment to strike, her keen eyes were trained on Wayne; the mastermind behind all of this trouble. Unbeknownst to her as she held her vigil she was also being watched. Cameras throughout the cave tracked her location. From his dorm room Jason scanned through Tim's list of traps, smiling like a Cheshire cat when he found the perfect one. Now he just needed to wait for his moment.\n\u00a0\nCyborg, who had fled from the gremlin otherwise known as Damian, now found himself facing off against a laughing Captain Marvel who was currently trying to pitch a case for switching allegiance. \u201cMr Wayne provides full dental cover to all minions. You get access to all his tech. Imagine the upgrades you could get? There\u2019s a company car. You could have a Merc. Or a Bently. Or a mini-van. Snacks are provided. Unlimited tea and coffee. Plus, if I\u2019m the one to get you to turn I get a cash bonus!\u201d Through all of this he floated in the air calmly dodging every attack a panting Cyborg tried to hit him with and occasionally zapping the man back a few feet. \u201cDid I mention the holiday entitlement? Two weeks a year and unlimited PTO for injuries sustained on the job. Which is important because evil goon is a high-risk occupation.\u201d\nThanks to his ability to move faster than light Duke was running rings around Flash which was clearly driving the speedster nuts as he dashed around the room trying to grab the younger man only to find him gone before he could tighten his grip every time. \u201cStay still damn it!\u201d he snarled. Duke waved from his perch on top of the dinosaur. Flash ran up the tail but by the time he got there he was alone. From his new position on the metal staircase Duke grinned. \u201cMake me, slowpoke.\u201d\nOn the rotating platform to the centre of the cave Cassandra danced around Black Canary, perfectly merging her ballet and combat skills to keep the older woman on her toes. Still disorientated from being blasted by her own scream earlier, Canary knew better than to try that attack again within the confines of the cave so was limited to martial arts and it was becoming clear the younger woman had the advantage. Canary watched as Cassandra flipped up onto the hood of the car then cartwheeled over the roof only to sprint back down and launch towards her without warning. She barely avoided a foot to the face in time.\n\u201cMissed me,\u201d Barbara teased cartwheeling past Green Arrow. She frisbeed a clay pigeon towards his head and watched it shatter as an arrow hit it. \u201cMissed me too,\u201d Stephanie shrieked mimicking the other girl\u2019s motion and throwing a glitter bath bomb that burst into dust as it was struck leaving all three of them in a cloud of strawberry scented bicarbonate powder. The two girls darted around the man, taking turns throwing projectiles to draw fire as he rapidly shot them away.\nTim and Green Lantern were caught in a stalemate. The boy sat calmly inside a green cage, finger on the button of a device that would tip ta vat of yellow liquid over the lanterns head temporarily neutralising him. Not because it was yellow; that was an old lantern tale to scare new recruits, just because it was highly toxic. Tim had emptied over nine hundred glow sticks to fill the vat. He could have just ordered the liquid in bulk, but methodically opening and draining the glow sticks one by one had made him feel like a true evil villain, which had been a fun way to spend a weekend.\nThere were also water guns filled with the same liquid set to fire automatically from all sides when the vat tipped so Lantern couldn\u2019t even construct an umbrella to shield himself.\n\u201cDrop the button.\u201d\n\u201cLet me go.\u201d\n\u201cDrop the button.\u201d\n\u201cRelease me fiend.\u201d\n\u201cDrop the button.\u201d\n\u201cFree me from this prison!\u201d\n\u201cAre you always this dramatic?\u201d\n\u201cIt runs in the family,\u201d Tim nodded. \u201cYou cannot hold me forever. I shall escape these bonds!\u201d he cried, sitting perfectly still in his cage, making no effort to escape.\nIn the midst of the chaos the giant wall of screens above the computer terminal switched on to reveal Jason wearing a Jigsaw mask.\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d he greeted. \u201cIsn\u2019t it nice you could all be here to play our game? Now for some added tension, lets add a countdown!\u201d\nOn the screen a large 10 appeared in red.\nAt almost that exact moment something drastic happened.\nFlash switched sides.\nOne moment he was fighting Duke, next he was helping Barbara and Stephanie, knocking arrows out of the air.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Arrow demanded.\nFlash grinned, \u201cI\u2019ve seen the light. Marvel is right. Villainy is the way to go.\u201d\nWhat he\u2019d actually seen was a short video at super-speed, roughly explaining the truth of what was going on and offering him a chance to join the prank, shown to him via a headset Duke had quickly slipped over his eyes.\nWith an ominous click the countdown dropped to 9.\nHawkgirl swooped overhead the group. Flying as close to the top of the cave as she could manage without hitting the stalactites. She raised her mace,\nMany miles away in a dorm room Jason pressed a button.\nHis moment had come.\nThere was no visible reaction in the cave. Not at first. Except for Superman who winced and rubbed his ears, confused by the strange sound being picked up by what little of his super-hearing remained in his weakened state. Then came the bats.\nThe winged creatures appeared in a swarm. Seeming to bleed out of the darkness from every corner. Several of those fighting paused for a moment to shriek in alarm. Strategically placed speakers transmitted a carefully chosen frequency, guiding the bats through the space until they converged on a panicked Hawkgirl, knocking her out of the air and down into the same net Flash had escaped earlier.\nThe large screen clicked again.\n8\nFlash stole Arrow\u2019s bow, hanging it from the dinosaur\u2019s mouth, effectively knocking the marksman out of the fight.\nBarbara and Stephanie each produced some rope and lassoed Arrows shoulders then started tying him up like a maypole, ducking and skipping in opposite directions around him with their two ends as Flash cheered them on.\n7\nAcross the room Jarro gave an extra push and Aquaman\u2019s willpower failed, leaving him in the alien starfish\u2019s control.\nAquaman now a reluctant helper to team Wayne, followed Jarro\u2019s lead as together they went to help Cassandra against Black Canary.\n6\nDuke, now unoccupied charged at Green Lantern, pushing him out from under the glowstick vat and blasted him with energy, causing his construct to fail releasing Tim. The effort of shielding against the onslaught quickly caused the Lantern to lose energy and his ring gave out, suit dulling and eventually fading away to reveal his civilian clothes below.\n5\nCyborg blinked, eyes scanning the urgent email he\u2019d just received from someone called RedR. It contained roughly the same information Flash had been shown.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he said powering down the guns he had been loading to fire at Captain Marvel, \u201cTell me more about this dental plan.\u201d\n4\nBlack Canary screamed at the top of her lungs, frustrated beyond belief at her predicament. The sound was muffled and harmless since she was now trapped beneath Jarro who had simply grown to eight feet tall and flopped down on top of her. Aquaman sat comfortably on Jarro\u2019s back and Casandra amused herself cartwheeling around the five points of her alien brother\u2019s body.\n3\nAfter an epic battle of wills Martian Manhunter finally managed to push through Bruce Wayne's mental barriers. What he saw was surprising.\nNo maliciousness. No evil intent. Just feelings of humour. Affection. Some exasperation.\nThe exact nature of what was going on was still unclear but Manhunter was now sure they had misjudged the situation. With a curious head tilt, he stepped back from Wayne and shrugged, abandoning the fight.\n2\nHer sword skills tested vigorously for the first time in far longer than she had realised, Wonder Woman began to tire. One by one as their opponents either switched sides or were defeated the Wayne children came to join Damian in his fight, surrounding the warrior princess and forcing her to defend herself from every side. She snarled and kicked and swung her sword viciously, now facing the added challenge of both Flash and Cyborg helping the Wayne's to take her down. It was all over when the lasso of truth was snatched from its place at her belt and used to bind her arms to her side uselessly.\n\u201cYou were a good opponent,\u201d Damian complimented. \u201cMore than adequate.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to eat your turkey,\u201d She promised darkly.\n1\nSuperman grunted with exertion, his fists raised to defend against Dick\u2019s incoming roundhouse kick, batting the attack away even as he stumbled back. They had fought hard and Superman was sad to see that all around him his team was either losing or turning on him. This isn\u2019t how he thought things would go. With a resigned shake of his head he turned to Batman, giving him their customary smirk. If nothing else, he was glad he would go out fighting beside his friend. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s just us now.\u201d\nHe watched with sinking horror as Batman turned about face, exposing his back to their opponent and shaking his head in regret. \u201cNo, my friend. It\u2019s just you.\u201d\n0\nSuperman fell. There was no more fight left in him.\nAcross the cave the Wayne's helped their fallen opponents back up (or down in Hawkgirl\u2019s case) and gathered them in the centre of the training mats around the despondent looking Superman.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Dick pouted crossing his arms. \u201cWe made Superman look like a kicked puppy. We are officially villains.\u201d\n\u201cAww, I feel guilty now,\u201d Stephanie sulked, accepting a hug from Cass.\n\u201cI blame Drake,\u201d Damian added. \u201cThis was his plan.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\u201cI thought it was Bruce's plan?\u201d Duke said.\nOn the screen above them Jason removed his mask and nodded. \u201cYeah, blame Bruce. Totally his doing.\u201d\nBruce hung his head, wanting to deny it, but he caught sight of Superman\u2019s face and felt a pang of guilt.\nThe confused Justice League watched the group bicker, still a little on edge but sensing that something had shifted in the air. Whatever urgency had filled them during the fight was gone and as one they seemed to understand the danger had passed, if there had ever been any danger to begin with, although even the ones who had been partially let in on the deception weren\u2019t totally sure of the details.\n\u201cOk, time out,\u201d Green Lantern said, feeling naked in his jeans and t-shirt, his ring still out of juice. \u201cWhat the heck is going on?!\u201d\nFlash raised his hand in the air, bouncing on his toes in excitement. \u201cOh, I know I know.\u201d\n\u201cI doubt that,\u201d Bat-fred muttered, making the speedster pout. Feeling guilty the old butler then made up for it by pulling a snack bar out of his utility belt and tossing it over.\n\u201cIst\u2014suf\u2014prnk\u201d Flash explained around a mouthful of oats and honey.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lantern demanded.\nCyborg rolled his eyes and stepped up, roughly summarising the email he had received. \u201cIt\u2019s a prank. Nightwing is an old associate of Batman\u2019s. That\u2019s why he trusted him so quickly. When they found out about our suspicions, they decided to mess with us.\u201d\nA few of the team glanced towards Bruce who was standing with his hands in his suit pockets.\nGreen Arrow looked furious, \u201cAre you kidding me? After everything we went through, this whole ordeal was just Nightwing pranking us?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Bruce smiled, \u201cThis was Batman pranking you.\u201d\nAll attention turned to Alfred.\nBlack Canary shook her head, \u201cBatman doesn\u2019t have enough of a sense of humour to be the ringleader of this.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d Bruce argued.\n\u201cWell obviously you do Nightwing, which is how we know this is your doing.\u201d\nAcross from them Dick groaned in frustration, burying his face in his hands and screaming quietly into his palms. \u201cI\u2019m not that old! Why do you think I\u2019m old??\u201d\nBruce shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s Nightwing,\u201d he said pointing at Dick. \u201cI\u2019m Batman.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re Nightwing?\u201d Flash asked Dick, at the same time Aquaman firmly told Bruce, \u201cYou are not Batman.\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d they both responded.\n\u201cThis is Batman,\u201d Green Lantern insisted, pointing at Alfred.\n\u201cAlfred, take off the mask please?\u201d Bruce pleaded, tired of talking in circles.\nAround him the League members all gasped. \u201cDude, you can\u2019t just reveal Batman\u2019s name like that! That\u2019s like rule number one.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite alright,\u201d Alfred assured them, letting his British accent through once more. He pulled the mask free with a flourish, the performer in him demanding no less. \u201cI believe it is time to come clean.\u201d\nThe sight of the greying older gentleman made many of the League pause for a moment before Wonder Woman let out a sharp gasp.\n\u201cAlfie?\u201d\nAlfred turned to her with a smile and stepped forward, wrapping the warrior woman in a hug which she easily returned.\n\u201cHello Miss Prince. It\u2019s been far too long.\u201d\nThis unexpected exchanged shocked not only the League but the entire Bat family as well. Bruce\u2019s head rapidly turned left and right looking between his butler and his teammate, jaw on the floor.\n\u201cYou two know each other?\u201d\n\u201cWe worked together once, many years ago,\u201d Wonder Woman explained.\n\u201cWhen I was a far younger man.\u201d\nBruce damn near choked on his own tongue. Not once in all the time that he had been working with the Justice League had Alfred mentioned knowing Wonder Woman.\nThough to be fair Alfred had never said much of anything about his own mysterious past.\nRegardless, never let it be said Bruce wouldn\u2019t seize every opportunity.\n\u201cMiss Prince, Wonder Woman, ma\u2019am, Your Highness, please I beg you; tell me everything you remember about young Alfred. I need to hear this like I need air.\u201d The Amazonian rolled her eyes and gave Alfred a conspiratorial look that just made Bruce more determined. \u201cI will pay you a million dollars to tell me everything,\u201d Bruce tried, \u201cTwo million. Please?\u201d\nThe pleas fell on deaf ears it seemed.\n\u201cIf I had known you were in Gotham,\u201d Wonder Woman addressed Alfred with confidence, \u201cI would have immediately known you were Batman. Now that I do know it seems so obvious, from what I remember of you it couldn\u2019t have been anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come on!\u201d Bruce whined.\nThe Bat-family were now even more curious, clambering around Alfred demanding information.\nWhatever concerns the rest of the League had over Alfred\u2019s age were dispelled by Wonder Woman\u2019s assurances. There was no question in any of their minds now that he was the real Batman. The shock of learning Batman's identity at last seemed to have chased away their anger at being tricked.\nFlash ran forward to stand before the man, his eyes wide with amazement. \u201cWoah, Batman, you are way older than I was expecting. That is so badass and awesome. How are you so fit?\u00a0 Oh, wait, Barry Allen,\u201d he introduced himself, quickly remembering his manners. \u201cNice to finally officially meet you.\u201d\n\u201cAlfred Pennyworth,\u201d Alfred greeted, \u201cAt your service.\u201d\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re British?\u201d Green Lantern asked, pushing Flash aside to get closer to the man. \u201cNo way. In all the years we\u2019ve worked together I never would have guessed you were British! Changing your accent is such a top tier secret identify move. I wish I could do that.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not Batman,\u201d Bruce repeated again. He was ignored by everyone.\nAround him his multitude of children were fighting back laughter. Traitors.\n\u201cI\u2019m a trained actor,\u201d Alfred was explaining as king of the traitors. \u201cAnd I of course learned more than a few tricks during my time in the secret service.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a spy? Like an actual spy? Like James Bond?\u201d\n\u201cIn another life I was. In the Queens Service.\u201d\nHawkgirl was nodding in understanding. \u201cThat\u2026makes perfect sense. Of course, you would have a background in espionage.\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Green Lantern was nodding. \u201cI just knew you would have some cool backstory like that Spooky.\u201d\nAquaman seemed equally assured. \u201cIt is no wonder you have proven such a reliable advisor to me in my role as King. It seems so obvious now that you had prior experience with royalty.\u201d\nBruce stood rooted to the spot, jaw hanging open, unable to believe what was happening. \u201cAlfred,\u201d he pleaded.\nThe older man ignored him, happily regaling the League with the tale of how he Alfred Pennyworth became Batman.\nBruce glanced towards his children, eyes pleading for help, but found none.\n\u201cAnd then I crossed over to the states,\u201d Alfred was saying, \u201cand found my way to Gotham.\u201d\n\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d Stephanie whispered practically vibrating with delight.\nStepping forward to join the gathering crowd of Justice Leaguers Superman looked deeply relieved. \u201cYou didn\u2019t betray me,\u201d he laughed in relief. \u201cIt was just a joke. Oh, I\u2019m going to be so mad at you later but right now I\u2019m so happy.\u201d He clasped Alfred\u2019s hand firmly. His grin widened as something else occurred to him, \u201cIt was you who knocked me out in the dining room. That\u2019s such a relief. Now that I know you\u2019re Batman I don\u2019t feel so bad about it.\u201d\nAlfred smiled back at him. \u201cI\u2019m glad you brought that up Mr Kent, because based on everyone\u2019s performance here today I think a new League training regime is in order. You should all be better prepared for such attacks.\u201d\nThe team all groaned but didn\u2019t protest.\n\u201cGreat, he\u2019s still a hardass!\u201d Black Canary complained.\n\u201cAlfred,\u201d Bruce tried again. The kids were outright laughing at him by now, drawing the team\u2019s attention to them.\n\u201cYou trained all these younglings to fight?\u201d Wonder Woman asked Alfred.\n\u201cIndeed. I felt it best they be prepared to fight if needs be, given the state of the world.\u201d\nShe nodded in understanding.\n\u201cAll except Brucie, that is,\u201d Alfred clarified, gesturing to Bruce with a smug grin. \u201cThe dear boy never had the stomach for fighting. He\u2019s too much of a sensitive soul. And frankly he\u2019s always been a little clumsy.\u201d\nThe kids were clinging to one another crying with laughter.\nBruce had never felt so betrayed. \u201cHow is this happening?\u201d\n\u201cFather makes himself useful in other ways,\u201d Damian piped up, smiling wickedly. \u201cHe sometimes helps Batman bandage his wounds after patrol.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he cleans the Batmobile,\u201d Tim added biting his lip.\n\u201cAnd takes care of the pets.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the kids,\u201d Alfred added, throwing Bruce a bone. \u201cBruce is a very good Father.\u201d\nThe Leaguers all took the time to stop and look closely at the gaggle of children surrounding them, for the first time looking a little impressed with Bruce.\n\u201cThese are all your children?\u201d Aquaman asked, \u201cImpressive, seven younglings. A mighty brood.\u201d\n\u201cNine,\u201d Bruce corrected quickly.\n\u201cHu?\u201d\n\u201cI have nine kids,\u201d he then turned and re did the count, naming each child in turn, including Jason on the screen. \u201cIn total, counting biologically, legally, and spiritually.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014counted the starfish?\u201d\n\u201cHis name is Jarro and he\u2019s my son. I\u2019ll thank you to be respectful.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s your son? That\u2014\u201d\n\u201cArthur,\u201d Bruce snarled. \u201cHe\u2019s my son. Watch what you say.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the dogs?\u201d Flash ventured, sounding unsure \u201cAre they\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThey are pets.\u201d Bruce cut in with an eye roll. As if it were obvious. \u201cAs are the cats, the turkey, the cow\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd the elephant,\u201d Dick added.\n\u201cElephant?\u201d Black Canary squealed; everyone was now glancing around in horror as if they all might somehow have overlooked the presence of an entire elephant in the room.\n\u201cShe lives at the zoo,\u201d Bruce explained.\n\u201cOf course, she does.\u201d Green Lantern snarked, \u201cbut the starfish is family and the cow lives in the house.\u201d Bruce\u2019s calm nod just riled him up further. He glanced around at the strange assortment of people. Then at the cave. The dinosaur. The giant penny. Batman.\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. I feel like I\u2019ve just walked into the Addams Family.\u201d\nThe Lantern recoiled in alarm as every member of the Bat-family, in total synchronicity raised one hand and snapped their fingers twice. Even Jarro neatly flicked one of his star points in time with the rest.\nHe wasn\u2019t scared. Lanterns didn\u2019t get scared. He was justifiably concerned. He was also very relieved to see the rest of the League looked equally disturbed by this display.\nFlash leaned forward, morbidly fascinated. \u201cAddams family,\u201d he tested.\nThey did it again.\n\u201cHoly shit. Addams\u2026\u201d\nSuperman slapped a hand over Flash\u2019s mouth to silence the speedster. \u201cStop,\u201d he snarled in warning.\nWith a chuckle Alfred beckoned everyone to follow him, moving towards the metal staircase. \u201cCome. Now that everything is mostly cleared up, we should all convene upstairs. Timothy, please turn off all of the traps? Barbara if you would kindly bring the performance reports for each of our guests, we still need to discuss all the ways they could stand to improve. It may take a while.\u201d\n\u201cYou really are a good actor,\u201d Green Arrow whistled. \u201cHow do you sound so polite when you\u2019re insulting us right now? Usually, you sound like a miserable bastard.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t push your luck, Arrow!\u201d Alfred snarled in a perfect imitation of Bruce in full Batman mode.\nGreen Arrow shrieked and jumped back, face white. \u201cSorry.\u201d\nAll of the bat-kids were staring at Alfred in horror.\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Cassandra whispered. All of the shocked faces turned on her.\n\u201cCassie don\u2019t swear,\u201d Bruce pleaded. \u201cMy heart has already suffered enough today.\u201d\n\u201cGiven the quantity of guests and the fact that I will be too busy discussing the new training regime to cook, I will on this singular occasion allow the purchase of fast-food,\u201d Alfred stated, his voice dripping with disapproval.\nThe kids all hollered in excitement, unable to believe what they were hearing. A chant of \u2018Pizza, Pizza, Pizza\u2019 echoed through the cave as they ascended to the manor above, both bat-kid\u2019s and Leaguers alike joining in.\nThe image of Jason on the bat-computer monitor frowned in annoyance at the now empty cave. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just hang up then,\u201d he muttered. \u201cNo pizza for Jason.\u201d\nHis phone pinged in his pocket, a notification popping up.\n\u201cConfirmation of pizza order to UCL dormitory. Anticipated delivery time 30min.\u201d\nJason grinned and sent a text to Bruce.\n*Thanks dad*\nThe response was immediate.\n*I\u2019ve ordered 20. Share with your friends*\nJason shoved his feet into shoes and headed back down to the common room. He\u2019d tell everyone the pizzas were a thank you for their feedback on the maze game. As he descended the stairs he sent off one final text to Bruce.\n*You\u2019re still my favourite Batman*\n\u2026\nUp in the Manor Bruce watched as all the League members gathered around Alfred, eager to learn more about the Batman.\n\u201cI regret everything,\u201d he sulked.\nThe sofa he was sat on slumped slightly as Martian Manhunter plonked beside him holding a bag of oreo\u2019s. He accepted one from the packet when offered.\n*It is good to finally meet you Batman* the Martian said, projecting the words into his mind.\nBruce smiled, feeling a deep relief that at least one of his friends knew the truth. *You too J\u2019onn*\n*Though I suppose after that party we already know one another intimately*\nBruce immediately shut off his mind, blushing furiously.\n\u201cI was maintaining my cover,\u201d he defended out loud.\nManhunter smirked. \u201cSo was I.\u201d\n\u201cThree million,\u201d Bruce called out to Wonder Woman as she passed by, still trying to negotiate for information on Alfred.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYou can have my car,\u201d he offered, \u201cMy house. One of my children. Pick your favourite.\u201d\n\u201cThe young one is a menace.\u201d\n\u201cNot that one then. You can have Jason. Jason is great. He loves you. You\u2019ll love him.\u201d\n\u201cI want the turkey. Preferably roasted.\u201d\n\u201cThe young one would roast us both.\u201d\n\u201cTake it or leave it.\u201d\nBruce scowled. \u201cFine, keep your secrets.\u201d\n\u2026\nThe next few hours were a chaotic mess.\nAround the dining room table \u2018Batman\u2019 grilled the League on every poor decision they had made over the last few weeks, with each of the kids chiming on with their own comments and suggestions for improvement. Damian and Tim, in a rare moment of synchronicity were particularly scathing in their criticisms.\n\u201cIt was so obviously a trap,\u201d Tim was saying to a bashful looking Cyborg, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been more obvious of a trap if I had placed a flashing sign above the door that said TRAP. And you just walked in.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your sword fighting needs work,\u201d Damian added, eyes fixed on Wonder Woman.\n\u201cI was going easy on you, child.\u201d\n\u201cHa! A likely story. I demand a rematch.\u201d\n\u201cSit down, both of you!\u201d Alfred snarled in his Batman voice which was still creeping all of the kids out. \u201cWonder Woman your training regime will include sword fighting practice, I am sure we can arrange a duel with young Damian another time. For now, we need to discuss the flagrant and reckless use of civilian names whilst in the field.\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking of civilian names,\u201d Superman cut in. \u201cMaybe we should all switch to using them now? Since we\u2019re all friends here.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, Mister Kent.\u201d Alfred agreed projecting the air of an annoyed school teacher, \u201cNow, everyone turn to page 24 of the report.\u201d\nA number of the League grumbled in protest but did as told, as Alfred moved on to his third lecture of the night.\n\u2026\nBruce watched on, amused that his team was being berated by his butler and his children and mildly relieved that since Alfred was chairing the meeting he could just sit back and relax. Although he was still frustrated that they didn\u2019t believe he was Batman.\nJ\u2019onn kept up a running commentary of sarcastic quips, projected into his mind all the while, which went a long way to softening the blow.\n*I realise the team don\u2019t posses my ability to shapeshift, but even accounting for that limitation their disguises during the party were truly horrendous.* he chuckled during the espionage portion of the lecture.\n*Your disguise still didn\u2019t stop me recognising you.* Bruce pointed out.\n*Did you recognise me before or after you put your hand on my\u2014*\n*Before. And we will never speak of it again*\nA rumble of laughter filled his head.\n\u2026\nOutside the manor some seriously confused looking delivery guys from a half dozen pizza joints began to arrive all around the same time, each juggling towers of boxes.\n\u201cYou think they are having a party in there?\u201d a kid in a Pizza Hut uniform asked another dressed in Dominoes red and blue. Both looked up at the big house. There weren\u2019t many lights on, no music, no cars parked anywhere in sight, aside from their own.\nAnother car pulled up the drive with another stack of boxes, this one from a small local place.\nA blonde girl came out of the house to collect it, handing over the same $300 tip the other drivers had already received, then disappeared back inside.\n\u201cMust be,\u201d Dominoes replied. \u201cThey\u2019d need a hundred people to eat all of those.\u201d\n\u2026\nBarry, finished off two thirds of the pizzas on his own.\nClark, Shiera, and Diana between them ate half of the last third. The rest were shared between everyone else.\n\u201cMan, that was good,\u201d the speedster declared, letting out a loud belch. \u201cThanks Wayne.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Bruce scoffed.\nOnce the lectures had finally ended, the team had stuck around to get to know the family.\nDespite his initial frustration Bruce was getting used to not being Batman, it was refreshing actually, like having a second chance at a first impression. He wasn\u2019t too proud to admit he hadn\u2019t been the friendliest person on the team since joining. Many of the League had learned to keep their distance from him, often walking on eggshells.\nMaybe he was a little paranoid after all?\nNow they were speaking to him as Bruce rather than Batman. It was nice.\n\u201cHey Brucie,\u201d Hal called out \u201cBatman says I\u2019m not allowed to drive the Batmobile.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstandable.\u201d Bruce replied, \u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d the Lantern grinned, \u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve got a few nice rides of your own. You rich guys aways do, right?\u201d\n\u201cI might,\u201d Bruce shrugged, thinking of the Lambourgini and the Corvette in his garage.\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cSo what?\u201d\n\u201cSo, you gonna let me drive one?\u201d\n\u201cI might,\u201d Bruce repeated with a smirk.\n\u2026\nThings settled down as it grew later.\nBruce broke out the good scotch and lounged in his favourite chair watching Barbara play J\u2019onn at chess with Dick waiting to play the winner.\nSomewhere several rooms away loud bangs could be heard every so often, interspersed with cursing. Duke was trying to teach Captain Marvel a trick where you light a lightbulb with your fingertips. Billy had exploded twenty lightbulbs so far and Barry kept running off to fetch more.\nAlfred, Damian, Shiera, and Diana had retreated back down to the cave to begin putting together a combat training regime, the later three all too impatient to wait and the former too conscientious to leave them without supervision.\nTim, Victor, Oliver, Stephanie, Cassandra, and Dinah were playing Mario Kart on the big screen in the cinema room. Tim and Victor were easily dominating the game but the others had united against them and were gaining ground.\nHal was cuddled up in front of the fire with the dogs and Alfred the cat who had emerged from whatever hiding place he had been holed up in all day.\nTo Bruce's bemusement Arthur and Jarro were arguing about politics, with the young starfish like creature expressing some strong views about current events and not backing down to the opinionated king.\nBruce gasped as a hand landed on his shoulder unexpectedly and a cheerful bark of laughter sounded behind him.\n\u201cWell look at that. I scared Batman,\u201d Clark grinned walking around and dropping into the seat opposite him.\n\u201cBatman?\u201d Bruce asked, playing innocent. \u201cI think he\u2019s downstairs.\u201d\nClark shook his head and smiled. \u201cThe effects of the Kryptonite and red sunlamp finally wore off,\u201d he said, \u201cNow that my powers are back, and I\u2019m not distracted by paranoia, I can see things little clearer. Alfred's a good actor but he\u2019s not Batman.\u201d\nWell, Bruce couldn\u2019t exactly argue with that could he?\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you know,\u201d he admitted.\n\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you,\u201d Clark told him sternly.\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cLike, so fucking mad!\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cYou screwed with all of us.\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\u201cYou made me think I\u2019d been captured by an evil villain.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cYou made me think you had betrayed me!\u201d\n\u201cTechnically Alfred\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBruce!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d better be!\u201d\nThe two stared at one another for a long while, Clark looking angry and Bruce contrite before both couldn\u2019t keep it up any longer and burst out laughing.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did all this,\u201d Clark chuckled. \u201cThe mind games. The traps. Pretending to be Nightwing. You were such a troll.\u201d\n\u201cYou made it so easy though,\u201d Bruce teased.\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s with all the kids? Mr. I work alone.\u201d\n\u201cI never said I lived alone though, did I?\u201d\nClark snorted. \u201cFair point.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think of Alfred?\u201d Bruce wondered. Since most of the team still thought the older man was Batman.\n\u201cTerrifying. I can see how you turned into\u2026well\u2026you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if that was a compliment or an insult.\u201d\n\u201cBoth? Neither?\u201d Clark shrugged. \u201cWhat do you think his connection to Diana is?\u201d\nBruce sat forward, eyes keen. \u201cI have no idea but I am dying to know.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Clark grinned, leaning forward as well. \u201cI\u2019m an investigative reporter you\u2019re the world\u2019s greatest detective. I think between the pair of us we could find something.\u201d\nBruce lit up with excitement. \u201cWe should get Tim and Victor involved too. Between them they can hack anything.\u201d\n\u201cAnd J\u2019onn, with his powers he might be able to sense something from one of them?\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my son Jason is in London right now. Maybe he can track down something there?\u201d\n\u201cMr Wayne,\u201d Clark told him, pouring himself a glass and raising it to clink against Bruce's, \u201cThis sounds like the beginnings of a scheme.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to be back on the same side again.\u201d Bruce agreed.\n\u201cI was always on your side.\u201d Clark pointed out. \u201cYou were the one who schemed against me.\u201d\n\u201cYou started it.\u201d\n\u201cDid not.\u201d\n\u201cYou were stalking my son. And acting weird.\u201d\n\u201cYou were acting out of character. We were justifiably concerned. You were the one who took advantage of our concern and pretended to be a supervillain.\u201d\n\u201cI was pretty convincing, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cYes, locking me in a sensory deprivation room for hours was very convincing,\u201d Clark\u2019s face was stern but his small smile betrayed that all was forgiven.\n\u201cYou are going to guilt trip me about this forever, aren\u2019t you?\n\u201cYou make it so easy.\u201d\nWith that Clark tipped his glass back and emptied it before going for a refill.\nBruce grinned watching the kryptonian chug his $3000 whiskey like water, probably completely unaware of its cost.\nIt was shocking to think that just a few weeks ago he had been determinedly concealing his secret identity, unwilling to trust his team with that last part of himself despite knowing deep down that he could. Now thanks to a simple misunderstanding that whole team was in his house, laughing and interacting with him, Alfred, his children, his pets. Fitting into the other side of his life like it was inevitable they would.\nIt felt like a page had been turned. One that was long overdue.\nIt felt like family, friendship, and trust.\nIt felt like a beginning.\n\u2026\n\nBonus\n\nThree days later Bruce began receiving notices that the team had amended their Fuck or Die contracts again. Nightwing was no longer excluded.\nBruce stared at the screen blankly for a few minutes then called Alfred. \u201cYou want to be Batman?\u201d he decided already fleeing the cave. \u201dYou can handle the paperwork.\u201d"
