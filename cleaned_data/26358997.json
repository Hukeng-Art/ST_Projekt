    "text": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was always something slightly off kilter about entering a 24/7 convenience store at 4am, especially if one was to enter with a torn hero costume and the expression of someone who didn\u2019t know what sleep was.\n\u00a0\nWhen Izuku, Kacchan, Todoroki and Yayorozou stumbled bleary-eyed into the first convenience store they found, the acne prone storekeeper straightened his back immediately at the sight of Musutafu\u2019s latest up-and-coming heroes. He buried his chemistry textbook under the counter and watched with bated breath as none other than U.A\u2019s Big Four browsed the food aisles. Not that it mattered anyway - none of them were paying any attention to him.\n\u00a0\nIzuku stopped in front of the ramen section, dropping into a crouch to scan the cheaper items below. God, he was so tired. He knew, they  all  knew, that their work would initially involve a lot of grunt work, stress and sleepless nights. But  knowing  about something beforehand was still very different from  experiencing it.\n\u00a0\nHe sighed. You\u2019d think that after almost half a year of being freshly graduated U.A students, it would get easier to handle.\n\u00a0\nWhen Kacchan crouched down next to him, Izuku wordlessly passed him the instant ramen cup with the most synonyms for \u2018spicy\u2019 displayed on the cover and gathered three other cups in his hand. Todoroki and Yaoyorozou had unsurprisingly taken to instant noodles pretty easily this year, considering the lack of time to cook anything else now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOi shithead, get that natto thing. I want to throw it at Raccoon Eyes while she\u2019s still on patrol and watch her scramble to eat them off the ground like a bird.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku would have laughed at the aggressive show of sentiment if his brain didn\u2019t feel like it was stuffed with cotton. Instead, he just let out an amused huff and passed the natto over. \u201cSure, Kacchan. I\u2019ll buy them since you\u2019re so concerned about your friends\u2019 wellbeing.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI ain\u2019t fucking - wait, isn\u2019t that Ears and Dunce Face?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe followed Kacchan\u2019s line of sight to the small television attached to the wall opposite them. Izuku\u2019s eyes widened in surprise when he, indeed, saw Jirou and Kaminari on TV. They were sitting on plush armchairs as the show\u2019s host prattled on about something along the lines of the importance of hero work from the desk opposite them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s -\u201d Izuku started, the excitement already swelling up inside him. \u201cIsn\u2019t that  Heroes Rising?  The talk slash game show hosted by the legendary Lady Hanazawa! How did they manage to get an interview there?! That\u2019s so  cool!  Did any of you guys know about this?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTodoroki materialised in their aisle with his own basket of snacks as Yaoyorozou trailed right behind him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKyouka mentioned that she was going on air with Kaminari some time ago,\u201d she said, eyes falling back to Izuku when the commercials started. \u201cIt has something to do with Kaminari wanting to increase his popularity rankings. Apparently he\u2019s dragging her along because Kirishima couldn\u2019t make it and he didn\u2019t want to be lonely.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan scoffed. \u201cRight, like showing your face on TV is suddenly going to boost you up the hero ranks.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt does help though,\u201d Todoroki interjected, shrugging. \u201cYou can\u2019t exactly rise to the top of the ladder if you\u2019re not viewed favourably by the citizens you\u2019ve sworn to protect.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSpare me the lecture, Icyhot.\u201d Kacchan stood up, grabbing the ramen and cradling the natto in the crook of his elbow. \u201cNot my fault you extras need to jump at whatever shitty opportunity you can get just to get to my level.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cStop calling us extras,\u201d the three of them sighed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTodoroki placed the items from Yayorozou\u2019s hands into his basket. \u201cBesides, Bakugou, last time I checked you were barely scraping the top 50.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku snorted into his hand. He looked up at Kacchan, expecting to see some sort of explosion or outburst, but was greeted instead with a hard scowl.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d he said without any real bite. \u201cCan\u2019t really fucking do much when you\u2019ve only been up against D list villains.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Todoroki replied easily, moving past them to get to the counter. \u201cA boost in your rankings wouldn\u2019t hurt though. Especially for someone as feral as yourself.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHah?!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat? Just last week the media falsely identified you as the villain during your fight against the guy with a literal lava quirk,\u201d Todoroki retorted, trying (and failing) not to smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably because he kept yelling \u2018Die scum!\u2019\u201d Izuku added helpfully.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, and!\u201d Yaoyorozu contributed, \u201cremember when last month that young girl needed help finding her dog and cried when you said you\u2019d help her? Because she thought you were scary? It\u2019s a shame someone had to upload that to the internet.\u201d She laughed, one hand pressing against her chest at the memory. \u201cAh\u2026 sorry for laughing, Bakugou, how impolite of me. It was just so funny.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t preach about politeness and turn around and keep laughing. Damn hypocrite.\u201d Then Kacchan looked down at Izuku, who had since resorted to just sitting on the floor. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare fucking laugh, Deku.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe was already in the beginnings of a laugh, though, and couldn\u2019t bring himself to stop. \u201cAw, don\u2019t be like that Kacchan,\u201d he said, standing up even though his body very much wanted him to lie face down on the ground. \u201cIt  was kinda funny. Nobody could ever say stuff like that about you in middle school.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe stared at Izuku for a second but didn\u2019t respond. His eyebrows were knitted together, and he looked like he wanted to say something, but he just muttered a \u201cTch,\u201d and moved towards the counter where Todoroki and Yaoyorozu were already leaving after buying their snacks.\n\u00a0\nAfter Kacchan and Izuku paid for their things together, (read: Izuku paying for their things because Kacchan paid last time and he needed to make things  even)\u00a0Kacchan took one quick look at the change in his palm and scowled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWrong change, dumbass\u201d he snapped. The cashier tried to stutter out an apology but wasn\u2019t given the chance to. \u201cDidn\u2019t they fucking teach you how to-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cKacchan.\u201d Izuku placed a placating hand on his shoulder, his eyes set into disapproval so stern and intense that Kacchan made no move to argue. The gesture did seem to leave him silently fuming though. When Izuku turned to look at the cashier, the look was instantly replaced with a bubbly smile. \u201cKeep the change, it\u2019s hardly anything anyway. Thank you for your service!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe cashier swallowed tightly, looking as if he very much wanted to say something. Izuku picked up on it pretty easily.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm.. did you want us to sign something for you?\u201d More nodding. A well-worn textbook materialised instantly from under the counter and was slid towards the two of them with a pen.\n\u00a0\n\u201cC-Could you address it to Aiko?\u201d the kid squeaked, eyes flitting between the two of them. \u201cShe\u2019s my younger sister. She\u2019s been totally obsessed with you ever since you assisted Suneater in that fight last month.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAh, the incident that he and Kacchan had fought together in! Izuku blushed but muttered his appreciation, flipping over the cover to scrawl a note on the first page.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut when Kacchan moved to take the pen from Izuku, the cashier surged forward and snatched the book and the pen away, very pointedly not looking at the explosive hero. Kacchan\u2019s hand still hovered in the space above the counter.\n\u00a0\nAnd then, to Izuku\u2019s surprise, the boy bowed dramatically. \u201cT-Thank you hero Deku! Keep us safe!\u201d The boy just as quickly away ducked down and busied himself with something underneath the counter.\n\u00a0\nIzuku honestly expected Kacchan to explode at the kid, but when he looked back at him, Kacchan\u2019s eyebrows were furrowed more out of confusion than anything else. The two of them followed Todoroki and Yayorozou out of the store with bags in their hands, feeling a little perplexed at the entire interaction.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think he finds you intimidating,\u201d Izuku said tentatively when they stepped outside. Yayorozou looked behind them to watch the cashier through the glass door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell Ground Zero in costume isn\u2019t the most comforting sight,\u201d she said with a one shoulder shrug. \u201cNot to mention he\u2019s always so crass.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe definitely needs to go on that show,\u201d Todoroki agreed. He pulled his phone out to check the time and sighed. \u201cTwo more hours until our shift ends. I suppose we have to return to our positions now.\u201d There was a half hearted grumble of complaining - they did love being heroes after all - before they said their goodbyes and made their way back to their positions.\n\u00a0\nIzuku walked with Kacchan since they were somewhat stationed close to each other. He glanced at the blond now, noting his unusual silence. He hadn\u2019t even shouted back a retort when Todoroki and Yayorozou were teasing him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou good?\u201d he asked, leaning a bit forward to catch his eye.\n\u00a0\nKacchan glanced at him and frowned. \u201cWhy the fuck wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomething\u2019s bothering you,\u201d he said simply, not wanting to press but still wanting to get him to spill.\n\u00a0\nThere was the slightest, most insignificant hesitation in Kacchan\u2019s eyes that would\u2019ve gone unnoticed to anyone who wasn\u2019t Izuku. \u201cNothing is fucking bothering me,\u201d he grumbled. And then his bottom lip jutted out stubbornly, as if his lie hadn\u2019t already been obvious enough.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomething\u2019s definitely bothering you,\u201d he sighed. When Kacchan didn\u2019t say anything immediately, Izuku smiled at him. \u201cHey, I thought you didn\u2019t care about what civilians thought of you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI  don\u2019t,\u201d he snapped. He stopped walking, keeping his hands in his pocket as he scowled at Izuku.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat dumbass kid,\u201d Kacchan grit out, as if he couldn\u2019t stop himself from talking about it, \u201cdidn\u2019t even fucking say anything to me. And he looked-\u201d he stopped himself, hesitant to continue. \u201cI mean, it looked like-\u201d\n\u00a0\n It looked like me when I was once scared of you, Izuku completed in his head, chest squeezing. \u201cStop thinking about the pas-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up Deku, I seriously don\u2019t give a fuck about what others think about me.\u201d He paused, eyes flicking up to the dark sky and back down to Izuku. \u201cBut it fucking  pisses me off  when people treat me like some kind of villain.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s heart broke a little at the words. Kacchan was far from an angel and he could be downright callous sometimes, but there was pure heroism within him that burned so much brighter than everything else. And Izuku had admired this in him for as long as he could remember. And he  knew, knew it like it was simply another fact of the world, that there was seriously no chance in hell Kacchan could ever become a villain.\n\u00a0\nThat was one criticism Kacchan had never deserved.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSeriously, shut up,\u201d Kacchan interrupted with an eye roll, sensing Izuku\u2019s thoughts without him having to voice anything out loud. \u201cI know, okay? I know. Now can we stop talking about it? It\u2019s fucking nothing anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s  not nothing,\u201d Izuku grumbled, folding his arms against his chest as a frown etched itself on to his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve to be seen like that. Not after everything you\u2019ve been through.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck, I said I know that already. I could practically hear the speech in your head just now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku managed to crack a small smile at this. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a game they sometimes play on  Heroes Rising  called \u2018Do You Really Know Me?\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. \u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd,  I think we would be so good at it!\u201d He smiled even wider as he began to imagine the two of them sitting side by side on those armchairs and on those electronic podiums for the game. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had the best track record in the past, but we really worked to get to where we are now, didn\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf this is your way of dragging me onto that shitty show to boost either one of our rankings then count me out. I hate the media and I got nothing to show them. Damn vultures.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku pouted. \u201cI don\u2019t think  you  of all people need to feature on live television to become a great hero. You\u2019re amazing enough to do without that and you\u2019re strong enough to never  need anyone\u2019s approval at all. Besides, you\u2019re perfect as you are right now and I wouldn\u2019t want anything about you to change. I just-\u201d He paused, trying to gather his words.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf he had looked at Kacchan now, he would have seen the stunned expression at his words. But Izuku had looked down at his hands instead. \u201cIt would be really cool to see us do things like that on TV. You know, as hero partners.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe really  did want to go on that show, if only because he had loved it so much growing up and fantasised about one day being on it as a pro hero. And it\u2019s not like it would be bad for Kacchan either! If the people could see him as just some regular guy with a bit of a rough personality, and not some hero with an evil streak, it could do wonders to his ratings!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe looked at Kacchan as a lightbulb flashed excitedly above his head. \u201cI heard the record for that game is 6 questions correct out of 10.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA beat passed as Kacchan gave him a complicated look. \u201cSo?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I think we can get 10 questions correct out of 10.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnother, longer pause.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be really fun, Kacchan?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe taller hero just stared back at him, eyes squinting from the obvious bait set up for him but somehow still unwilling to outright refuse. His eyes roamed Izuku\u2019s face, painted purple and pink under the neon lights they were stopped under. His freckles stood out here, his cheeks a little pinker, his smile soft and inviting.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(He had meant to say no, actually. He had meant to scoff and shove Deku\u2019s head to the side with an \u201cIn your dreams, nerd.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from Deku\u2019s stupid smile and his wide imploring eyes and that stupid tear in his outfit\u2019s shoulder, revealing just the slightest sliver of pale pink skin).\n\u00a0\nSo he said, \u201cWe could definitely fucking ace that game.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAll Might was, unsurprisingly, on board with it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYoung Midoriya, that is a  fantastic idea.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou really think so?\u201d Izuku put his knife down on the cutting board to hold the phone tucked into his shoulder. \u201cI was just thinking it\u2019d be nice to show my face to the world, you know? The new Symbol of Hope and all that. And you do have some pretty big shoes to fill\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nThere was some rustling on the other end of the phone. \u201cWell, you are still quite new to this, my boy,\u201d All Might said. \u201cAnd in all honesty, media attention might not be so wise when you are just starting out - expectations and all that. There\u2019s no hurry to do anything when you\u2019re so new.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku fiddled with the hem of his shirt. \u201cBut?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAll Might chuckled at this. \u201cBut I think that being known by the public isn\u2019t going to change the fact that there are still going to be expectations for the type of hero you want to become. Who knows, it might give you even more reason to protect the people of this city. Besides, I think the public would love to see you all the same and come to know and trust you. You have the most charming aura, my boy, I\u2019m sure you would gain quite the following.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis cheeks instantly warmed at the praise, still not used to his idol\u2019s affection. \u201cJirou and Kaminari were on the show recently,\u201d he deflected.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI saw. You know, as I was watching them I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what it would be like if you participated in the show with Bakugou shounen.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s eyes lit up at this, absentmindedly reaching out towards the diced tomatoes before popping some of them into his mouth. \u201cRight?! I was watching some old episodes of the show last night and I was just thinking about how if I had been there with Kacchan I would\u2019ve known the answer to every single one of them! And the record is 6 questions correct out of 10, you know, so when I brought it up with Kacchan he was actually considering it! He\u2019s so competitive. It\u2019s like\u2026 after everything we\u2019ve been through - the fighting and the miscommunication - I feel like we\u2019re in a good place right now.\u201d He took in a deep breath. \u201cI feel like I \u2026 understand him now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was silence on the other end for a while as All Might let this sink in. \u201cMy my,\u201d he said eventually, his voice soft. \u201cLook at how far you two have come.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt was the awed, reverent way he said it that made Izuku want to cry. \u201cI - yeah. I-I\u2019m really glad...\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll see if I can pull some strings and get the pair of you on the show. If Bakugou is on board too, that is.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s spine straightened instantly. \u201cAre you serious? Really, you can do that? That would be amazing! And don\u2019t worry about Kacchan, I\u2019m sure he would agree. He\u2019s been doing this thing recently where he doesn\u2019t really argue back anymore.\u201d Izuku sheepishly rubbed the back of his neck. It was true though. Nowadays, he couldn\u2019t help but notice the easy way Kacchan would just grunt his approval whenever Izuku asked him to do something.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, these are just plans for now,\u201d All Might warned. \u201cI can\u2019t confirm that I can get you a spot on the show but, well. If I can\u2019t recommend you guys to go on it, I\u2019m not sure who else can.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, All Might! I won\u2019t let you down!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAll Might laughed heartily. \u201c\u2018Let me down\u2019? Son, there\u2019s no way you can do that. Especially not for a game show! That\u2019s-\u201d There was the quiet sound of a doorbell followed by a faint \u2018 Toshi? \u2019. \u201cAh, that must be Inko,\u201d he said, a little awkwardly. \u201cUm, would you like to say hi to her\u2026?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku snorted. There was no need for All Might to be so awkward about dating his mother, but he didn\u2019t press it. \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I talked to her yesterday anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course,\u201d All Might said, sounding happier now that he had opened the front door. \u201cGoodbye, Izuku.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, is that my baby on the phon-\u201d Inko\u2019s voice cut out as All Might ended the call. Izuku smiled, allowed himself a second to look at his phone and feel happy for his mother and All Might\u2019s new relationship, and steeled himself to go back to making lunch.\n\u00a0\nHe sighed over his half-chopped, half-eaten tomatoes.  I can take down a villain in a heartbeat but can\u2019t chop tomatoes into cubes. Perfect. \n\u00a0\nIf Kacchan was here, he would\u2019ve chopped it into perfect cubes with his eyes closed. He tried to imagine Kacchan in his kitchen, telling him what to do. And it helped sometimes, except now Imaginary Kacchan was wrapping one arm around Izuku\u2019s waist and guiding his hand with the other, and Izuku\u2019s eyes were closing as he caught the phantom caramel scent of nitroglycerin and felt Kacchan\u2019s hand over his own, his gruff voice in his ear, telling him to move the knife just so-\n\u00a0\nThe knife clattered against the cutting board as his cheeks burned. God, he really needed to get these thoughts out of his head. He was supposed to be Kacchan\u2019s  friend , and there\u2019s no way he was going to ruin that with these feelings getting in the way.\n\u00a0\nHe couldn\u2019t tell when it had started. One day the both of them had been perched on a rooftop, scanning the city below with keen eyes. Izuku had turned to look at him, something conversational on his lips, before the words caught in his throat as he merely stared at Kacchan\u2019s still and alert expression.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n He is so beautiful in the sunset, he had thought, his heart going a million miles per hour. It took all his strength to keep his hand by his knee even though it yearned to thread itself through Kacchan\u2019s hair. Things weren\u2019t the same after that.\n\u00a0\nBut if he really thought about it, if he really dug deep, he would find that this infatuation \u2026 it wasn\u2019t new. In fact, it was  so  familiar and so rooted in his being that his affection was practically muscle memory at this point. It was a wonder that he had only realised it so late. No matter how naturally the feelings had come to  him , though, it didn\u2019t change the fact that Kacchan only thought of them as friends at best.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe began chopping up the tomatoes with such a frenzied frustration that Kacchan would\u2019ve actually praised him for the speed.\n\u00a0\nThat night, Izuku laid awake in bed, mentally going through his To-Do List.  Okay, tomorrow I need to text Uraraka about how things are going with Tsuyu, I need to also get my laundry in order when I get back, I should probably start thinking about a present for Eri\u2019s birthday- \n\u00a0\nA buzz from his bedside table startled him out of his thoughts and he reached for his phone in the darkness.\n\u00a0\nA text from \u2026 Kacchan?\n\u00a0\nHe checked the time, bewildered. It was only 9pm, so not too late for Kacchan either then. Izuku let himself smile like a teenager with a crush and unlocked his phone. What was Kacchan going to say?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nFrom: Kacchan sugoi!! &lt;3\n\ndajfhuewi\n\u00a0\nIzuku blinked at his screen.\n\u00a0\n\nFrom: Kacchan sugoi!! &lt;3\n\nfuck\nignore that\n\u00a0\n\nFrom: Izuku\n\nAhaha, it\u2019s not like you to make typos Kacchan\nWhat are you up to? :)\n\u00a0\n\nFrom: Kacchan sugoi!! &lt;3\n\ndidn\u2019t i just tell u to ignore that\ngo to sleep deku\n\u00a0\n\nFrom: Izuku\n\nI can\u2019t :c\nYou know I nearly cut my finger off today!!\n\u00a0\n\nFrom: Kacchan sugoi!! &lt;3\n\nu were trying to cut tomatoes weren\u2019t u?\nu know that you can just cut the shit into slices and THEN into strips?? how has ur nerd brain not thought of that? smh\n\u00a0\n\nFrom: Izuku\n\nJeez, how did you even know it was the tomatoes? Ah I don\u2019t know why I even ask anymore. It\u2019s so cool that you just knew that though (\uff20\uff3e\u25e1\uff3e)\n\u00a0\nThe three grey dots in the corner kept appearing and disappearing for a while. Maybe he needed to say something else? Gah, he was just going to thank him for the cooking advice-\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Izuku gasped as his phone began ringing. He stared at Kacchan\u2019s contact picture in disbelief - one of the two of them grinning into a camera, half tipsy at their graduation party.\n\u00a0\nKacchan didn\u2019t really call him this late at night, so he answered it with more eagerness than what was required for answering a call.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey Kacchan!\u201d he greeted instantly, not bothering to disguise his excitement.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUhh..\u201d Kacchan\u2019s voice sounded kind of rough, as if he had just woken up. \u201c\u2018Sup, nerd.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku tilted his head at the way he sounded awkward, hesitant. He was probably just sleepy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomeone sounds sleepy,\u201d he smiled. \u201cHow come you\u2019re still up?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that late, asshole.\u201d Izuku could practically see him rolling his eyes. At least he sounded more awake now.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt is for  you,\u201d he retorted. \u201cBut I guess even you could have trouble sleeping at night. Have you tried watching a really boring video to make yourself feel sleepy? I heard that works. I mean, I tried doing it once but it didn\u2019t really work. I was watching a video about the aging process of orangutans and it actually made me feel  more awake. On a side note, I can\u2019t believe the palm oil industry is single handedly destroying the orangutan population-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOi. Listening to your stupid nerd voice is making me fall asleep.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s cracked a grin. \u201cOh? Should I read you a bedtime story then?\u201d he said, voice teasing. He placed his phone down on the pillow next to him and laid down next to it, smiling at it as if it was really Kacchan next to him and not just his disembodied voice speaking out of a piece of plastic and glass. It was kind of sad really. Izuku batted the thought away.\n\u00a0\nThere was a short, muffled laugh on the other end and Izuku\u2019s heart was basically on cloud nine right then. \u201cWhen\u2019d you get so fuckin\u2019 cocky, Deku?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t say anything for a couple of seconds - not because he didn\u2019t know what to say, but because he was listening to the faintest of sounds in the background. Then, \u201cYou\u2019re watching  Heroes Rising, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was some rustling. \u201cOkay, that's fucking creepy-\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe settled himself more comfortably into his pillows with a satisfied smirk. \u201cI recognised the host\u2019s voice. Lady Hanazawa is pretty hard to ignore... But hey, you\u2019re actually watching it! Did you watch the episode with Kaminari and Jirou? Doesn\u2019t the hero-duo game look like  so much fun?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not bad,\u201d Kacchan admitted, apparently pausing the video since the background noises stopped. \u201cAnd yeah I watched theirs before. Fuckin\u2019 losers only got 4 questions correct.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku laughed. \u201cWell, to be fair, you need to answer the question for not only yourself, but for your partner too. So I guess they have the disadvantage of not being childhood friends! It\u2019s probably to be expected that they got so many questions wrong.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d Kacchan sounded kind of serious now, his voice solid and completely certain. Izuku felt a blush coming on and pressed a hand to his cheek.\n\u00a0\n\u201cErm - hmm. No,\u201d he said, clearing his throat, \u201cI know we wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was a heavy pause between them, and Izuku found himself enjoying the intimacy of it. If his mobile phone had one of those cords on old landlines, Izuku knew he would be twirling it in his fingers right now.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI talked to All Might today,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cHe said he could try to get us on the show. That is, if you actually want to?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Kacchan grumbled. \u201cCould be interesting, I guess. Watching these losers get questions wrong is just making me want to show everyone how it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo competitive, Kacchan.\u201d Izuku quietly laughed. \u201cWho knows, you might even gain quite a following! I\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re quite popular with high school girls.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe blond snorted. \u201cYeah, no. They\u2019d be wasting their time on someone who\u2019s gay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku froze instinctively.\n\u00a0\nAfter an awkward pause, a voice said: \u201cDeku?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cO-Oh, uh. I mean - uh, I\u2019m... Same here. Kind of. Um, yeah. I\u2019m - the same. Sorry, I was just kind of surprised.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku chewed on his lip. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh\u2026 that\u2019s cool, I guess.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI - does anybody else know?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis time, the silence stretched for so long that he thought that Kacchan had hung up on him. \u201cUm, hello?-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo. Nobody else knows. Not like it\u2019s anyone\u2019s business anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFair enough, Kacchan,\u201d he said simply, letting his smile bleed into his words, hoping it would be of some comfort to his friend. \u201cHey, why were you watching  Heroes Rising  anyway?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan\u2019s relief at the subject change was palpable through the phone. \u201cDunno, I was just thinking of-\u201d he stopped. \u201cThinking  about the whole popularity thing. I mean it wouldn\u2019t hurt, I guess. And I wanted to see what kind of lame games they play on it, so.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku yawned and nodded, still knowing full well that Kacchan couldn\u2019t see him. \u201cKacchan doesn\u2019t need to appear on a show to be popular.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I know,\u201d Kacchan said, almost a little fondly. \u201cIs my voice boring you, Deku?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMmmm,\u201d Izuku\u2019s eyes closed shut briefly. \u201c\u2018Course not. I could listen to your voice  all night.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIf Izuku wasn\u2019t feeling so sleepy, those words would\u2019ve mortified him. But Kacchan\u2019s deep voice was soothing, even if it was peppered with swear words every now and then, and he found himself growing tired.\n\u00a0\n(If Izuku was in the same room as him, he would\u2019ve seen the way Kacchan\u2019s hands flew to his face to smother the unwanted blush that was spreading there).\n\u00a0\n\u201cGo to sleep,\u201d he said roughly.\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2018Kay, g\u2019night Kacchan. Nice talking to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Yeah. Night.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku fell asleep with his phone still lying underneath his palm.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAll Might was right when he said that if he couldn\u2019t get them on the show, then nobody else could.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt had been approximately a month after All Might had apparently \u2018pulled his strings,\u2019 and Izuku had just gotten a call from Hanazawa\u2019s manager informing him that he and Kacchan were appointed to appear on the show in just over three weeks. An email detailing the rules of the various games played, as well as rules for other interview etiquette and tips, popped up on his phone now - just like how the manager said it would.\n\u00a0\nIzuku didn\u2019t bother opening it up yet.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKacchan!\u201d he yelled from across the gym. The other gym stragglers paid no attention to Izuku shouting at the ungodly hour of 5am, since they were more or less accustomed to his presence in their agency\u2019s gym now.\n\u00a0\nThe man in question was currently doing his daily pull up routine on the other end of the room. He didn\u2019t bother grunting out a reply or even stopping, which meant he was pissed off at Izuku for talking to him while he was exercising. From behind him, the earliest signs of a rising sun welcomed them through wall-length windows.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku bounded towards the pull up equipment and skidded to a stop in front of a very sweaty, very engrossed Kacchan. \u201cGuess who scored a spot on  Heroes Rising?!\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan spared a look down at him from above the pull up bar, pausing in the air casually as if it was nothing. His eyes scanned Izuku\u2019s face before his eyebrows raised slightly. \u201cShit,\u201d he muttered. He dropped to the ground and cracked a grin. \u201cAlready? Damn, alright then. When are we on?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s grin only grew wider when he saw that Kacchan was just as excited as he was. \u201cThree weeks!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh. That\u2019s not too far away. Shouldn\u2019t-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOur schedules are already cleared for the night Kacchan, the show gets in touch with our agencies to shift things around, so\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOi, no freaking mind reading before the show.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBut Izuku\u2019s eyes had become unfocused and he was no longer listening. \u201cAh, I don\u2019t really have anything nice to wear. I mean I have that black suit from graduation but I\u2019ve gained a little bit more muscle mass now and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll fit. Oh, it might actually. I\u2019ll have to try it out. But what if it doesn\u2019t? I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t had the need to wear a suit this whole year.\u201d When his eyes flicked back to Kacchan, he almost wished that they hadn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nKacchan was wiping the sweat from his face with a white towel before he hung it around his neck and stared right back at him. Izuku\u2019s mouth went a little dry with the effort of not letting his gaze linger on the shiny glaze of his skin right under Kacchan\u2019s collarbone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUhh...\u201d he said, intelligently.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe can just go looking for a suit if you\u2019re that worried,\u201d Kacchan said with a roll of his eyes. He swiped at the water bottle from the ground and took a long swig, unaware of Izuku\u2019s eye transfixed on his bobbing Adam\u2019s apple. His eyes narrowed as he lowered the bottle. \u201cThe hell are you staring at?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen Izuku\u2019s eyes snapped back to his red ones, he realised that he had, somehow, been staring at Kacchan\u2019s chest. The blond looked down at his chest as if to find anything out of the ordinary and Izuku was struck by the sudden desire to get on the nearest flight out of Japan. Then: \u201cDamn, how did you notice that?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKacchan flicked off a tiny bug that had settled on his tank top, nearly camouflaged amongst the black. Izuku exhaled and sent a prayer to the heavens thanking them for the creation of tiny, sweat-attracted insects.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, anyway,\u201d Izuku forced out, praying to the same heaven that he wasn\u2019t blushing like mad. \u201cWe should-\u201d He stopped. \u201cWait.\u2018We\u2019 ?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou said  we should look for a suit for me.\u201d Izuku tilted his head to the side. \u201cIsn\u2019t this something I would normally just do by myself?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku didn\u2019t miss the way the bottom of Kacchan\u2019s neck bloomed a sudden red and he snorted without volition, even though he knew it would just serve piss Kacchan off.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the  fuck  is so funny?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cKacchan wants to hang out with me!\u201d he sing-songed, laughing gleefully.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I fucking don\u2019t,\u201d he snapped, clearly embarrassed about something. \u201cForget I even said anything-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo!\u201d Izuku clapped a hand over his own mouth when it came out louder than expected. He glanced around the gym, which was slowly growing in size. Nobody, as usual, paid him any attention. \u201cI-I mean  no ,\u201d he said, leaning in closer and whispering the last word. \u201cYou should definitely come with me! It\u2019ll be fun. Ah, I dunno why I whispered before. Oh look!\u201d Izuku\u2019s eyes squinted slightly as the room was slowly flooded with warm sunlight, dousing his face with a soft golden hue. \u201cSun\u2019s rising.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKacchan hadn\u2019t said anything to interrupt whatever the hell that disjointed speech was. In fact, he was totally silent as he watched Izuku look out at the cityscape horizon with a smile that could outshine the sunrise itself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d he gritted out, acquiescing to a request that  he had offered in the first place. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you. Only because you have no fucking style and you need someone to save you from yourself.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy hero!\u201d Izuku laughed, hoping that the exercise elevated Kacchan\u2019s mood at least a little bit so he wouldn\u2019t get attacked for a little teasing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSeriously, Deku. It\u2019s like you  want me to rip every bone from your body and hurl them to fucking Norway.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAh, so the exercise  did work!\u00a0\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nThe fact that they were only given two backstage passess for friends or family made things difficult.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWell, difficult for him anyway. When he had asked Kacchan who he was going to bring he was met with a: \u201cHuh? We can bring two people? I guess Kirishima and Pinky can tag along.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNeedless to say, he was quite annoyed and more than a little envious that he was able to pick so easily.\n\u00a0\nAs Izuku climbed into the passenger seat of his mother\u2019s car, he tried not to feel guilty about picking his mom and Uraraka as his two guests.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t feel so guilty about picking Inko because, well, he loved her to bits and she was probably the one who deserved all of the special treatment he could give her. On the other hand, picking a friend had been hard. In the end, Izuku just sent a link to a random name generator to the group chat and let his friends have at it.\n\u00a0\nUraraka\u2019s name came out on top, which is why she was currently gripping the roof handle in the backseat of Inko\u2019s car, her face green with worry at the way Inko was racing through the streets.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeku-kun!\u201d she pleaded, her voice muffled from the hand pressed against her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you and everything but -  OH MY GOD MS. MIDORIYA-SAN PLEASE SLOW DOWN -  I very nearly almost died on the way to your house because your mother drives like a maniac! Do you have a -  AAAHH I\u2019M GOING TO DIE! YOU ALMOST RAN OVER THAT CAT - do you have a paper bag in here?\u201d\n\u00a0\nInko was smiling serenely from the driver\u2019s seat. Izuku marvelled briefly at the elevation of her seat and how she was nearly pressing into the steering wheel. \u201cAh, sorry to startle you Uraraka-kun! Truth be told, I\u2019m not entirely sure how to drive any slower than this!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe car jostled as Inko drifted at nearly a right angle, narrowly missing a red light as she took a left turn. Izuku and Uraraka held on to the roof handles for dear life, even though Izuku was smiling without a care in the world. He turned around in his seat to beam at his friend.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello to you too, Uraraka! You clean up pretty nice!\u201d She did look nice too, in her pastel pink blouse and baby blue jeans. Gaping at his nonchalance, she just gave him an incredulous look in return.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me Deku. How you survived getting to and from places with your mom is  beyond me.  Ms. Midoriya-san, you\u2019re going to hit the curb if you turn now!\u201d\n\u00a0\nMiraculously, she did not hit the curb. Even more miraculously, they had hit a slow spot in traffic and the car gradually became idle. Uraraka mumbled something about not having felt this woozy even after overusing her quirk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh Izu!\u201d Inko exclaimed suddenly, turning to look at her son with shiny eyes. \u201cMy baby is going to be on live television! And with Katsuki-kun of all people! I can\u2019t believe this. And just look at how much you\u2019ve grown! Gosh honey, I have never been prouder of you in my life!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku grinned and leant forward to give his mother a peck on the cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s what you said at my graduation. Also, I saw you three weeks ago, how much taller could I have gotten?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot a lot,\u201d she admitted as they began to crawl forward again. \u201cI just like to say it because it makes you smile. You nervous, honey?\u201d\n\u00a0\nUraraka, looking far more relaxed now, let out a shaky laugh. \u201cOh, he totally is. I wouldn\u2019t put it past you to be scared of a game show and feel absolutely nothing when taking down a villain, Deku.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith a sigh, he slid down the seat and tried to quell the butterflies in his stomach. \u201cUgh, if you put it like that then I feel stupid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, think about it like this,\u201d Inko said gently. Uraraka\u2019s grip tightened on the handle again as the car began to pick up speed. \u201cWhat would Katsuki-kun be feeling now?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d be fine, he thought. He took a deep breath in. So I\u2019m going to be fine, too.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe girl with the blue hair will be the ones giving you your cues,\u201d Kaji explained, pointing to a woman crouched beside the cameras, fiddling with a couple of whiteboards. \u201cObviously not telling you what to say because this show is about  you guys  showing off your personalities and all that - but more about what to do next, suggestions, et cetera. You guys read the email, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n Only about a million times, Izuku thought. He looked towards Kacchan, who was too busy crossing his arms over his chest and looking angry.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe two of them were fresh out of the hair and makeup departments and were currently standing in front of the famous plush armchairs of Lady Hanazawa\u2019s studio. Hanazawa\u2019s manager, a short dark-haired man named Kaji, sat casually on the desk opposite them with a clipboard resting in the crook of his elbow.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 duh,\u201d Kacchan said. \u201cJust tell us in three sentences or less what we gotta do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe manager rolled his eyes, not intimidated by the hero\u2019s glare in the slightest. \u201cHow charming,\u201d he drawled sarcastically. \u201cI can tell the audience is just gonna eat you up.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan bristled visibly at this. \u201cThe fuck is that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaji hopped off the table and raised both hands in a placating gesture. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m just expecting viewership of this show to go up, I guess. People like hot headed bastards like yourself. Just be yourself tonight, Ground Zero, you\u2019re gonna really ace this shit.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTo Izuku\u2019s surprise, there was no biting retort - even though he was called a  hot headed bastard by a stranger straight to his face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHah.\u201d He smirked. \u201cHell yeah, I am.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith that, Kaji ran through everything else that was expected of them on the show - most of which were rules that Izuku had already pored over from the email. The manager left soon enough with a muttered \u201cWhere the  fuck  is Kito right now ?\u201d leaving the two of them relatively alone again.\n\u00a0\nIzuku glanced at the watch on his wrist. \u201cOne hour till we start,\u201d he said with an audible gulp.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeku.\u201d Izuku\u2019s eyes flicked up to see Kacchan frowning at him. \u201cRelax. Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe sighed, a smile returning to him. \u201cI\u2019m more excited than anything, trust me. I just - I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re actually here. It feels really surreal. We\u2019re even wearing the matching shirts!\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhile they weren\u2019t technically matching, Kacchan\u2019s burnt orange button down was similar to Izuku\u2019s bottle green one. They had both rolled the sleeves to the elbows and had tucked it into their black pants too, so they definitely at least resembled a pair.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki looked down as if he had forgotten about that. \u201cFeels weird to not have my hero outfit on in front of these cameras.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku opened his mouth to reply but found nothing came out. Kacchan had looked so good when he had run into him in the lobby today, but he looked downright sinful now after the makeup artists worked their magic on him. The small smudge of eyeliner, a far cry from what was usually present under his mask, made his eyes even more alluring. They had even managed to make his skin look more perfect than it already was with a small dash of powder, leaving a seemingly drawn evenness.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was making him a little dizzy to be honest. \u201cKacchan?\u201d he questioned softly.\n\u00a0\nRed eyes snapped back to him and held his gaze. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis mind spun.  What, indeed. He needed to calm his heart down. \u201cYou \u2026 look good.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d Then, giving Izuku a very brief once over, said, \u201cYou, uh, look good too.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was an awkward silence as Izuku\u2019s mind blanked out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello boys,\u201d a silky voice spoke up from the desk.\n\u00a0\nJumping slightly, both of them turned immediately away from each other to face Lady Hanazawa.\n\u00a0\nLady Hanazawa was somewhere in her forties, but she had the mischievous expression of someone well into their rebellious teen years. Her long silver hair was plaited into a French braid that rested by her hip, where a perfectly manicured hand was resting. She tilted her head to regard this week\u2019s heroes, her eyes flashing with amusement.\n\u00a0\nShe had risen quickly up the hero ranks back when she was at her peak, making a name for herself as one of the most efficient heroes to have ever existed. In fact, she still held the record for the fastest take down of a villain in less than a second. Impressive as this was, Izuku was most enraptured by her Quirk, the one that appropriately inspired her hero name:  Freeze Frame. \n\u00a0\nLady Hanazawa could stop time for seconds or even for minutes at a time, allowing her to seemingly glitch in and out of positions. It was hypnotising to watch in action - one second she would be leaping off a building and the next she\u2019s got a thief slung over her shoulder on the street across. It helped too that Hanazawa was a seriously fast runner.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku could practically visualise the feverish notes he had taken of her from his middle school days. It took everything in him not to scream like a child. Instead, he tried to school his expression into something more professional.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt lasted for a magical second before his resolve crumbled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cL-Lady Hanazawa!\u201d he shrieked, instantly bowing deeply. \u201cIt\u2019s such an honour to meet you!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe former Pro Hero let out a laugh that was extremely similar to bells or a bird\u2019s trill. She placed a slender hand to her chest. \u201cOh no, you\u2019re cute! No need for the formalities son, we\u2019re here to loosen up! And good evening to you Bakugou-san,\u201d she dipped her head courteously at the blond, who had said nothing upon her arrival.\n\u00a0\nWhen Izuku straightened to look at him, he had to hide a smile. Kacchan\u2019s arms were folded over his chest, but Izuku could see how entirely put on that act was. He was  nervous.  A finger tapped rapidly against his ribs as he met Hanazawa\u2019s knowing smile head on.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFreeze Frame,\u201d he greeted. Then, in the brief silence that followed, he apparently felt that more needed to be said. \u201cUh.. thanks for having us.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo need to refer to me by my hero name,\u201d Hanazawa smiled. \u201cJust \u2018Lady\u2019 will do. How are ya boys feeling? Your other buddies - y\u2019know, the ones fresh out of U.A? -\u00a0 were looking a lot more nervous than you two.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re not nervous.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku took a second to realise that their voices had intermingled as they spoke in unison.\n\u00a0\nHanazawa raised a perfectly sculpted silver brow at them, her back straightening. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cThis  will be interesting.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs the audience filled up the seats and the room with quiet chatter, the Wonder Duo stood somewhat awkwardly behind heavy red curtains. From somewhere by her desk out front, Hanazawa was whistling casually.\n\u00a0\nIzuku was practically vibrating with excitement. And nerves. He couldn\u2019t tell the difference anymore.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe are going live in 10 seconds,\u201d a voice from the front of the stage indicated - Izuku couldn\u2019t see him very clearly because of all the lights hanging above him. He took in a deep breath through the nose, out through the mouth, and made eye contact with Ashido from the front row of the audience. She was sitting next to Kirishima, Uraraka and his mother, who was giving him an enthusiastic thumbs up.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...5, 4, 3..\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe shot his own thumbs up at them and turned to Kacchan standing beside him, who immediately caught his gaze. Izuku beamed up at him, teeth flashing as he practically vibrated on the spot. Kacchan just rolled his eyes and drew the curtain closed.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...2, 1. And, rolling.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFrom centre stage, Hanazawa snapped immediately into her television persona, her face splitting into a grin. \u201cHello everybody, and welcome back to this week\u2019s episode of  \u2018Heroes Rising\u2019! How are we all feeling tonight?!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was some cheering from the crowd as Hanazawa began to warm them up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s always so exciting to see our favourite heroes - with some squeaky clean new faces! - on the show with us. And let\u2019s be honest, I know half of you watch this show to see our apparently unstoppable heroes struggle with the challenging games on this show.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKacchan scoffed. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2018cause everyone else is a moron,\u201d he whispered, quiet enough that Izuku could only understand what he said from reading his lips.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a guilty pleasure, I know,\u201d Hanazawa continued. \u201cAnyway, we\u2019ve got a special lineup for you guys tonight, the likes of which include Pro Heroes Mount Lady and Fat Gum! Firstly, however, we will be introducing two heroes who - at this point in their careers - should by all means be largely unknown by the general public. Yet these individuals have such a phenomenal track record that it\u2019s no wonder that they\u2019ve already been making waves in the industry! Known for their powerful presence and their superior intellect in battle, please give a warm welcome to the rising hero partners Deku and Ground Zero, even though I\u2019m sure everyone has heard of them by now!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe pair of them waited as the curtains were drawn back before moving forward. Izuku couldn\u2019t contain his wide grin as the crowd applauded the two of them, even though his legs felt like jelly and he had to swallow subtly several times to get his nerves in check.\n\u00a0\nBy the time they sat themselves down in the armchairs, Izuku\u2019s mind was already going into overdrive. He crossed his legs, thought better of it, and placed his feet flat on the floor. Should he smile? Say hi? Was he supposed to be prompted to say hello?\n\u00a0\n\u201cWelcome guys!\u201d Hanazawa smiled at them, stretching long and elegant arms across the desk. Why was the light so bright here? Was it always this bright? \u201cMidoriya Izuku. Bakugou Katsuki,\u201d she said, inclining her head to each of them in turn. \u201cBoth of you have gained incredible traction over the past year, especially considering just how fresh out of U.A you both are. Of course, many of our viewers will recognise you both from that iconic Sports Festival so it\u2019s no wonder that the two of you have gotten so much attention recently. Tell me, how does it feel to be rising so quickly up the ranks?\u201d\n\u00a0\n Ignore the light,  he told himself.  Be yourself! Wait, that\u2019s terrible advice. Be literally anyone else! Be like Kacchan! No, Izuku that\u2019s worse, you\u2019re giving yourself worse advice- \n\u00a0\nIzuku steadied himself, summoned the All Might within him, and allowed his face to take on the elastic and amiable smile of his mentor. \u201cIt\u2019s really very exciting, Lady!\u00a0 Kacch- Ah, I mean,  Ground Zero  and I have worked very hard alongside all of our fellow heroes in training - so every day of our work is rewarding.\u201d He paused to beam at Kacchan, who looked like he was struggling not to scowl. (He was failing). \u201cAnd can I just say, it is an honour to be here on the show! Thank you all for having us; we are thrilled at the opportunity to get to know everyone!\u201d He directed this last sentence at the crowd as he bowed his head.\n\u00a0\nThe audience instantly let out a collective  awww, which in turn led to clapping. Izuku saw Kacchan rolling his eyes into his skull in his peripheral, but Izuku blushed at the attention all the same.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy, aren\u2019t you a charmer?\u201d Hanazawa cooed, leaning back into her seat with a smirk. \u201cBut correct me if I\u2019m wrong, is it true that you call Bakugou-san over here \u2018Kacchan\u2019? Where did that come from?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe opened his mouth to speak but was cut off with a gruff: \u201cIt\u2019s his dumb kiddy nickname for me.\u201d Kacchan paused for a second, glancing briefly over at Izuku before flicking his gaze back to Hanazawa. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other since we were kids.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAmongst yet another chorus of endearment, a loud \u2018Oh, that\u2019s cute,\u2019 rose above the noise, making the crowd laugh again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s adorable! You got any cute nicknames for Midoriya then?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA pause. \u201c...Deku.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHanazawa tilted her head at the blond. \u201cYou call him by his hero-?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo uh,\u201d Izuku interrupted, sheepish. \u201cMy hero name was, ah\u2026 inspired by that. It kind of sounds like  you can do anything!\u201d It wasn\u2019t the full story, of course. The full story was long, tumultuous, complicated and  painful . It had taken the two of them so long to reach a tentative alliance, let alone the friendship they have now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, you two certainly are close. Would that be why you wanted to participate in this show as a duo?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, partly,\u201d Izuku admitted, laughing a little. Hanazawa was giving him a smile that made him feel more at ease, and he could feel his muscles loosen up a bit. \u201cWe both really enjoy the show, you see, so we kind of thought it would be fun to put ourselves out there. Kacchan is also, um, kind of competitive so- He wanted to show everyone \u2018how it\u2019s done.\u2019\u201d He paused. \u201cHis words, not mine.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHah. As if you aren\u2019t competitive either, shitty nerd.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI never said I wasn\u2019t! Besides,  I\u2019m  not the one who tried to win a contest in  blinking  -  \u201d \n\u00a0\n \u201cTried  to win is a bit of a stretch, Deku. You\u2019re just mad because I\u2019m better than you at everything. Including blinking.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m better than you at emotional intelligence. How about that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour free ride to Norway is looking  real tempting right now-\u201d\n\u00a0\nHanazawa and the crowd laughed at that, and Izuku snapped back to reality. He should probably stay on track. For a split second there, he\u2019d forgotten about the crowd entirely. Looking back at Kacchan, it was obvious that he felt the same.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh this banter is  fun!\u201d  Hanazawa snickered. \u201cYou must be excited to show the world what you guys got, huh? Let\u2019s say we get started with the games already!\u201d\n\u00a0\n \u201cFuckin finally,\u201d  Kacchan said, before suddenly realising himself and grumbling an uncharacteristic, \u201cOops...\u201d\n\u00a0\nLeaning in and pretending to whisper to Izuku, Hanazawa said, \u201cDoes he kiss his mother with that mouth?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku let out a fond smile. \u201cThat\u2019s just how he is. I think it makes his personality all the more endearing, especially when you find out that he\u2019s not as harsh or cruel as he\u2019s sometimes made out to be. Kacchan really is an amazing person.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs Izuku\u2019s words caught up to him, he noticed his friend staring openly at him. He blushed, suddenly feeling the need to say something else, to  clarify,  but his words were taken with a pinch of salt by their host.\n\u00a0\n\u201cA hard boiled egg, eh? That\u2019s so cute! I could really eat you guys up right now, but I do still need two victims for our upcoming game. You ready?\u201d\n\u00a0\nGiving their approval, Hanazawa smirked and stood up. The two of them followed her as she led them to a levelled stage sitting on the other side of the studio. Izuku recognised it immediately as where the games were hosted, and could barely contain his excitement at the fact that he was  here!  The same place where All Might and Endeavour sat all those years ago, playing darts blindfolded!\n\u00a0\nThis section was more minimal than the warmer atmosphere of the talk show, sporting a white wall background and a white tiled floor. A digital clock hung on the wall, the timer set at 30 seconds.\n\u00a0\nTwo podiums were erected on opposite ends of the stage, their screens lighting up as their power turned on. An electronic pen rested in a groove by the writing board on top of each podium.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs the boys stood in front of their podiums so that they were looking directly at each other, Hanazawa took her spot in between them. \u201cSo, fans of this show will know exactly what game this is-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo You Really Know Me?!\u201d the crowd yelled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYES! Yeesh, y\u2019all are enthusiastic today. This game is called  Do You Really Know Me?\u00a0 which is reserved especially for hero duos! Just as the name suggests, our hero partners today will have to answer 10 questions about their partner. You will have 30 seconds to write down your answer or it will  not count  . To make the game more challenging, you will write your  own answer to the question at the bottom of the screen so we know that neither party is colluding. An answer is correct if both of your responses match! If even one answer is wrong, no point is awarded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you manage to beat our record of 6 out of 10 questions correct, there is a mystery prize of whatever gifts our fans have sent us for the purposes of this game. It could range from a silly rubber duck to some expensive headphones if our fan is particularly generous. However, if you both manage to score a perfect 10, then we will reward you both with \u00a58,000,000 each!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe crowd murmured in anticipation. Eight million yen! Imagine all the merch he could get with that...\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd, as always, no cheating. That means no nodding, hand gestures or signals, subtle drawings or anything of the kind. I mean, try not to even look at each other. Remember, I\u2019m a retired hero with the eyes of a hawk so nothing will go unnoticed. But without further ado, are we both ready to get started?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Wonder Duo nodded, eyes set with determination as they picked up the pens by their electronic board as if preparing for an exam to begin. Hanazawa smiled at the action, amused by their seriousness.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with the easy stuff,\u201d she said, eyes skimming over the clipboard in her hands. \u201cWhat is your partner\u2019s favourite food?\u201d\n\u00a0\n There\u2019s such a thing as  too  easy, ma\u2019am, Izuku thought, but brushed his smugness away for a second. Neither of them had to even look at each other as they scribbled down their answers in the first five seconds and buzzed in their answers.\n\u00a0\nBoth of their screens lit up, revealing their answers.  Katsudon  was written in all caps with a smaller  Spicy curry  at the bottom on Kacchan\u2019s, while  Spicy curry!  was written in Izuku\u2019s neat cursive with a smaller  Katsudon underneath it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHanazawa glanced between the two, checking their answers. \u201cOh. That\u2019s entirely word for word too! A good start to the game. Is there a story behind either of these?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cKacchan makes the best katsudon!\u201d Izuku interrupted before she had even fully finished speaking. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing chef, like he could definitely go pro!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou always say that,\u201d Kacchan said, crossing his arms even though he was clearly preening from the praise.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt would help if you turned the spice down though.\u201d Izuku shrugged.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt would help if you weren\u2019t such a weak piece of-\u201d\n\u00a0\nHanazawa stepped in with her signature host smile. \u201cWhy am I not surprised that he loves spicy food? Anyway, moving on to the next question! What is your partner\u2019s favourite thing to do for fun?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku gave himself time to think. Not about Kacchan, of course, but of what Kacchan would think  his favourite thing to do was. Unbidden, his voice entered his head as if yelling his answer at him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe tried not to smile as he scribbled  Hiking  for Kacchan and  analysing hero quirks!  at the bottom for himself. For extra credit, Izuku drew a couple of smiley faces.\n\u00a0\nWhen he noticed Kacchan had already finished, Izuku knew instinctively that his friend was treating this like a competition.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKacchan grinned as their screens lit up. Izuku dropped his gaze from Kacchan\u2019s face to the screen on his podium. There was a smiley face, albeit a little scary looking, next to his  watching nerdy hero analysis videos  . Underneath that, he wrote simply \u2018  Hiking. \u2019\n\u00a0\nIzuku brought a hand to his cheek as he laughed with the crowd. \u201cKacchan you don\u2019t know how to draw smiley faces! That looks awful.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe camera zoomed in on the evil grin of Kacchan\u2019s scribble as he retorted with a \u201cHah?! Mine looks fucking awesome. I bet it could beat all of your ones in a fight.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Izuku grinned. \u201cI think teamwork is crucial for hero work, and that fights should always be won with a smile!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs he expected, the crowd let out another  aww!  at the reference to All Might and Izuku triumphantly stuck his tongue out at Katsuki.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGoddamn manipulative,\u201d Kacchan muttered.\n\u00a0\nHanazawa snickered. \u201cIs it possible to give bonus points in this game? Man, where\u2019d you even find this kid?\u201d she asked Kacchan, who nearly startled out of his seat from the way she flashed forward from her seat to stand over him. Izuku hid a laugh behind his hand as Katsuki\u2019s cheeks gave an embarrassed flush. \u201cAnyway, moving on to the third question. If your partner was not a hero, what would their job be?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAt this, both of them turned to look at her with an incredulous expression. Wanting to be something other than a hero? That was \u2026 completely unthinkable.\n\u00a0\nNoticing their open stares, Hanazawa smiled softly. \u201cI know, I know. This is the only thing you\u2019ve ever wanted to do, et cetera et cetera. Just - imagine a world where you had no intention of becoming a hero at all. What would your partner do?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku bit his lip, thinking. He glanced over at the blond across from him, and saw his answer written in his expression. Red eyes stared off into space before sparking, a sharp grin etching itself over his face.  Okay,  Izuku thought,  that\u2019s his Fantasising-About-How-Cool-I-Am look, so he\u2019s definitely thinking about being famous of some sort. I wonder.. Perhaps a model? His parents are fashion designers after all. No, he\u2019s not the type to want to get famous on just looks alone. Or maybe\u2026 \n\u00a0\nAh.\n\u00a0\nHe scribbled \u2018Drummer\u2019 down quickly, hoping he hadn\u2019t broken the streak so early in the game. Below that he wrote  Mechanical engineer. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe stared at the answer for himself for a second. He was fairly certain Kacchan would know this one, but he couldn\u2019t be completely certain. What if he wrote down something like \u2018he\u2019d still be a loser\u2019  or \u2018a clown\u2019 or-\n\u00a0\n\u201cTime\u2019s up!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs their screens flashed, Izuku peered over his podium to look at Kacchan\u2019s screen. He let out a small smile of relief. So he was right about the drumming. What was better though, was Kacchan\u2019s very confident \u2018engineer probably\u2019 at the top.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you play drums, Bakugou?\u201d Hanazawa tilted her head.\n\u00a0\nBefore he could even reply, Izuku piped up excitedly. \u201cOh, you bet he can! He\u2019s awesome at it too! He used to take music lessons when we were kids and I used to think it was the coolest thing in the world! He even played for our cultural festival in first year, and he was really-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think they get it, Deku,\u201d Kacchan grunted. \u201cYes, I like playing drums. The nerd likes to solve problems and fix things and change the world or whatever, so of course he would do something like engineering. We moving on now?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWoah, what\u2019s the hurry?\u201d she laughed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKacchan wants to beat the record as quickly as he can,\u201d Izuku supplied.\n\u00a0\nHanazawa just laughed again. \u201cOf course he is, he definitely seems the type to be obsessed with winning.\u201d She skilfully ignored his angry  \u201cI am\u201d  as she continued, \u201cAnyhow, that\u2019s a 3 in a row streak! Shall we move on before your luck starts to run out?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t luck,\u201d Kacchan said, back straightening as if he\u2019d just been challenged.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe not for now, young hero,\u201d Hanazawa intercepted smoothly, \u201cbut don\u2019t underestimate the game. Guessing the answer for not only your partner but for how your partner perceives  yourself  is no easy task. With that, let\u2019s move on to question number four. What is your partner\u2019s go-to drink at the bar?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku would have laughed if it wasn\u2019t considered to be rude. Neither of them were very much into drinking - not that they really had the time for it anyway - but the few times they had gone out together with other members of their class made for \u2026 memorable times. Needless to say, it became obvious that Kacchan\u2019s first love was the fireball.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was ordered as a joke, initially, by Kaminari. Kacchan had gone with it because he didn\u2019t really care what he was drinking, as long as it \u201cdid the job.\u201d That was, in retrospect, a rookie mistake for someone who hadn\u2019t actually been much of a drinker before. A quiet laugh escaped him before he could stop it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up Deku, I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Kacchan grumbled from the other side, the tips of his ears turning red as he recalled that night as well.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry Kacchan, I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026\u201d Izuku quickly wrote down  Fireball (obviously!  ) and then a smaller  apple martini at the bottom for himself. It wasn\u2019t really his favourite, per se, he just \u2026 hadn\u2019t tried anything else? He hadn\u2019t had the best experience with beer after realising he couldn\u2019t really hold his alcohol well at all.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCome to think of it though, was Kacchan sober enough to recall what drinks Izuku nursed at the table as he was forced to watch the rest of his class get drunk off their faces?\n\u00a0\nWhen time was up and their screens lit up, Izuku\u2019s heart flipped in his chest as he read the words \u201cthat gross apple cocktail shit\u201d scrawled messily on top of Kacchan\u2019s screen. So he  had noticed.\n\u00a0\nIzuku relaxed. Of course, Kacchan had always been observant. He  was the one to figure out his secret about OFA just from picking up on little clues after all, so knowing about Izuku\u2019s drinking habits wasn\u2019t exactly an encrypted code in comparison. It was still nice to feel noticed, though.\n\u00a0\nKacchan wasn\u2019t looking at him though. He was scowling at Izuku\u2019s board in an obvious attempt to not make eye contact.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sensing a story behind this,\u201d Hanazawa prodded, grinning right at Kacchan. \u201cHow did Fireball whiskey ruin your life this time?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku made brief eye contact with Kacchan, the memory passing between them lightning fast.\n\u00a0\nKacchan had gotten  very drunk that night. The graduated members of Class 3-A had managed to book a private room at a local bar as they celebrated their last week before their hero duties began, and drinks were downed pretty easily the longer the night had progressed. He remembered glancing over at Kacchan a lot - the blond in question wedged in between Ashido and Kaminari from opposite him - trying to see what kind of a drunk he would be.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo maybe he\u2019s always been a little infatuated with Kacchan and wanted to know everything about him, what about it?\n\u00a0\nBeing the most sober person in the room, Izuku had tried to keep tabs on everyone else too. He really did. His eyes, however, kept straying towards the blond sitting on the other side of the table, his legs folded underneath him and his expression smoothed into something expressionless. Izuku found out that day that Kacchan was a quiet drunk. Quiet, until those loose lips started forming words.\n\u00a0\n \u201cDeku!\u201d  Kacchan had slurred as their class was very drunkenly standing up to gather their things and head home. He hadn\u2019t said much before, having resigned himself to silently brooding into his shot glasses with a confused furrow in his brow, so the sound of his voice had startled Izuku slightly. \u201c  Did you know ya got freckles? Like ... so many of \u2018em. They\u2019re  everywhere  . All over your face. You ever tried to just\u2026 rub \u2018em off?\u201d \n\u00a0\n \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never tried that Kacchan. I\u2019m just gonna help you walk for a bit, okay? \u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo many! They look real nice, y\u2019know? So don\u2019t rub \u2018em off. But sshh, don\u2019t tell Deku I said that. \u201d\n\u00a0\n\n And that was when he threw up his dinner over the curbside. \n\n\u00a0\nHe both suppressed a laugh and blushed at the memory. From across him, Kacchan was still avoiding his eyes and looking so obviously irritated that Izuku decided to speak up, turning to face Hanazawa.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d he trailed off, rearranging the words in his head as he tried to come up with something that wouldn\u2019t be so embarrassing for him, \u201cKacchan just ... smiles a lot. When he\u2019s drunk. And he, uh, doesn\u2019t like doing that\u2026 usually\u2026\u201d There, at least that\u2019s kind of endearing, right?\n\u00a0\nThe crowd at least seemed to think so, judging from their laughter. Hanazawa threw a wink at him. \u201cOhh, I see. He\u2019s the really edgy, bad-boy, you\u2019ll-catch-me-smiling-when-I\u2019m-dead type of guy then? I like that!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku faked a laugh, scratching the back of his neck. He could feel Kacchan\u2019s eyes on him but was too chicken to meet them, knowing exactly what he would see there. He knew Kacchan was surprised that Izuku had lied for him. \u201cHaha, I guess\u2026\u201d Gah, he  hated lying.\n\u00a0\nHanazawa\u2019s excitement began bleeding out now, reducing her to something resembling a teenager. \u201cOkay, well we\u2019ve never had a four question streak on the show before! This is  really impressive guys, can we get a good cheer from the crowd to keep our Wonder Duo going?!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku managed to give Kacchan a smile that he hoped was reassuring as the crowd began cheering and clapping for them. Kacchan just rolled his shoulders back and slumped into his chair, looking suddenly like he regretted coming on here.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRight. Izuku had been so swept up in the idea of the two of them showing the world just how smoothly they worked together that he had forgotten how  revealing  being on TV would be. Just the thought of having a drunk escapade being broadcasted to all of Japan made Izuku\u2019s stomach curdle. Even  if the escapade itself was relatively innocuous.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMoving on to question five, then! Here\u2019s where the challenging questions really start kicking in. What does your partner \u2026 think your best physical trait is?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku looked up from his screen, which his electronic pen had been hovering over. \u201cTrait?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah! Like, something about yourselves.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhat a convenient question. Izuku didn\u2019t look at him at all as he wrote down  My freckles at the top and-\n\u00a0\nHe stopped. What was Kacchan\u2019s best trait?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n All of them,  he thought. But he couldn\u2019t say that because there was no way Kacchan would write that as his answer so he\u2019d actually have to think about something specific now.\n\u00a0\nKacchan already knows that Izuku admires him as a  hero  , as someone who embodies the meaning of  victory.  But those weren\u2019t physical traits. Had he ever complimented Kacchan on anything other than that? He glanced up at the blond, only to find him looking right at him, his head tilted to the side in contemplation. Izuku startled but didn\u2019t look away, regarding him with an equally dissecting look. Izuku was aware that there was a 30 second time limit, but the world seemed to slow down as they tried to puzzle each other out without the use of words or gestures.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n His best trait ....\n\u00a0\nRed eyes glinted at him, telling him something, and Izuku\u2019s brain short circuited. And he knew, in that instance, what both of them were thinking. Smiling, he looked down to write  Kacchan\u2019s eyes  at the bottom with pure confidence.\n\u00a0\nWhen their screens illuminated not shortly after, Kacchan smirked and leaned back in his seat, pleased with his telepathic skills.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHanazawa quirked an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re sure neither of you have a telepathy quirk? That look you gave each other was kind of suspicious.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan\u2019s scowl returned as he glared up at the former hero. \u201cAs if we\u2019d ever be pathetic enough to cheat at something as stupid as a shitty game show.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cKacchan!\u201d Izuku said indignantly. \u201cLady was just joking!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, to be fair,\u201d Hanazawa said, tilting her head to the side, \u201cI was only half-joking. From what I can tell, you guys have some intense chemistry that\u2019s not actually quirk induced, but I am still kind of tempted to have you both face away from each other, just in case.\u201d When the crowd murmured their disapproval though, she shook her head with a small smile. \u201cBut hey, who am I kidding? If you can figure each other out with just a look then maybe you really do deserve to be featured on the show! Moving on, then...\u201d\n\u00a0\nDid she really have to use the word chemistry? This wasn\u2019t good for Izuku\u2019s heart, which had started pumping blood into his face like the traitorous organ that she was.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cQuestion number six: what is your partner\u2019s strangest fear?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe word came to him instantly-  jellyfish.  He almost said it out loud, actually, but managed to shut his lips tight at the last second as he scribbled the answer down. At the bottom of the screen, he wrote  Peonies :( for himself and drew a sad looking flower next to it.\n\u00a0\nAs soon as the answers revealed themselves on the screen, the audience began to murmur in anticipation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSix questions correct in a row!\u201d Hanazawa exclaimed. \u201cHow are you guys doing this? You\u2019re making us look bad.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I fucking say we were gonna ace this game?\u201d Kacchan growled. \u201cThat means  ten  out of fucking  ten. Next question.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku covered his mouth with his hand at how Kacchan looked absolutely menacing with his trademark glare - he was not looking camera friendly at all! - which was doing absolutely nothing to affect their host who simply laughed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou  did say that, Bakugou! Now, what\u2019s wrong with peonies, Midoriya? I would\u2019ve thought a sweetheart like you would love flowers!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe nerd once got stung by a bee when he put a peony in his hair,\u201d Kacchan filled in, crossing his arms over his chest and looking smug. \u201cWent home crying like a baby and hasn\u2019t looked at that flower the same way since. He still likes flowers and all that shit though because he\u2019s a fuckin\u2019  sap .\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku frowned at him. \u201cChildren  cry  when they are  stung by bees. And don\u2019t think we\u2019re ignoring the fact that you got stung by those tiny jellyfish on the shore when we went to the beach! I think I distinctly remember you crying about that too. Auntie Mitsuki was going to make you-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright! I get it, shut your damn mouth!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming these both happened when you were children?\u201d Hanazawa said, head tipping forward.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cFour years old, if we\u2019re being specific,\u201d Kacchan said, voice oddly tight. The crowd let out an  oooo!  sound at this, apparently impressed that Kacchan knew this. Izuku tried not to squirm under Kacchan\u2019s gaze. Most of their memories in which the two of them were actually close  was from the age of four. Before Kacchan got his quirk and everything changed between them.\n\u00a0\n But look at us now,  Izuku thought, feeling that warmth stir in him again. There was no room for bittersweet nostalgia here. When he looked up to meet his eyes, he knew instinctively that Kacchan understood what he was thinking. The very fact that he  knew this, deep down in his heart, made him smile even wider.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was a little scary, actually, to be read so easily by someone. Izuku was sure Kacchan felt the same way, as they broke eye contact at the same time.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, the intimacy of being childhood friends! Alright then, question number seven - ooh this is a good one - if your partner had to permanently swap quirks with another hero, who would it be?\u201d\n\u00a0\nOh, that  is  a good question. Izuku bit the end of his pen and tried to think about it objectively. Kacchan would want an impossibly powerful quirk not only because he likes the power it gives him, but because he  needs  it to prove to himself and everyone else that he can harness any quirk and make it his own, no matter how difficult it would be to use it. And he would definitely want something more on the offensive than defensive because he\u2019s all action and instigation through and through. And on top of that, he\u2019d want something  flashy as hell, because this is Kacchan we\u2019re talking about, and what is Kacchan if not a proud, egotistical prodigy?\n\u00a0\nHe wrote down  Hero Shouto\u2019s quirk  at the bottom pretty quickly, before pausing for himself. He sighed, knowing very well that before he got his quirk he would\u2019ve easily answered with All Might\u2019s quirk. Now though, the answer was obvious to him - but that didn\u2019t make it any less embarrassing. Drawing in a deep breath, he wrote  Kacchan\u2019s quirk  and tried not to feel too embarrassed by it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku  knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the explosion quirk as effortlessly as Kacchan could, but there was something thrilling about the chance to watch the nitroglycerin crackle in his own palms and actually put his years of research and observation of his childhood friend into practise.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe timer beeped twice as time ran out, and Izuku couldn\u2019t help the surprise on his face as he noticed Kacchan hadn\u2019t actually answered early this time. Kacchan put his pen down slowly, looking almost doubtful. Izuku swallowed. That wasn\u2019t a very encouraging look.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCameras, please do zoom in to the answers on the screen!\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen their answers flashed, Izuku\u2019s shoulders slumped in relief. Kacchan\u2019s board simply had  \u2018IcyHot, unfortunately  \u2019 at the top and  \u2018Me?\u2019  at the bottom. Izuku let a small smile escape. Why did Kacchan have doubts about that? He had only ever praised his quirk since the beginning of time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHanazawa was silent, her eyes wide as saucers. When she looked to the camera with that expression, the crowd laughed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGuys!\u201d she squealed, clapping her hands together. \u201cFrom the way this is going, you\u2019re going to not only break the record but get a perfect score! Oh this is getting my blood pumping! We will be taking a short break right now, but stay tuned everyone. Not that I need to encourage you to do that, of course, I\u2019m sure everyone is on the edge of their seats right now!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku waved at the camera before the sounds of the studio came rushing back in at them. Izuku exhaled loudly and slouched as the cameras went off.\n\u00a0\nHanazawa flashed towards Izuku at that very instant, spiking his heart rate as he nearly jumped out of his skin when her face appeared in front of him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou boys,\u201d she said slowly, mouth stretching open into a wide grin, \u201care  killing this! Did you practise beforehand? Are you really this close just from being childhood friends? I heard that you two weren\u2019t all that close during high school-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet the idiot breathe. Don\u2019t you have any concept of personal fucking space?\u201d Kacchan\u2019s voice came from directly above him, and he looked up to see him standing in front of him, glaring daggers at the host.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHanazawa laughed again, the sound so oddly airy that Izuku wasn\u2019t sure if it was actually coming from her. \u201cOh, I like you  Kacchan.  I didn\u2019t mean to frighten your precious friend, I\u2019m just really excited right now. My sweet Kaji just told me that viewership of tonight\u2019s episode is the highest it\u2019s ever been - er, not including the episode where All Might and Endeavour played darts blindfolded of course - so I\u2019m expecting great things from you two.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen Hanazawa moved to track down Kaji to no doubt harass him with her boundless energy, Izuku beamed up at Kacchan. \u201cWe\u2019re actually doing pretty good!\u201d he said, standing up so he can stretch his muscles a little.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 obviously. That\u2019s kind of the whole-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeku-kun!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku whipped his head around to see Uraraka, his mother, Kirishima and Ashido waving them over from the front row of the audience stands. Kacchan grumbled some obscenities at Uraraka for interrupting - which Izuku countered with an unimpressed look - before bounding up to them with a wide smile on his face.\n\u00a0\nFrom her elevated position, Inko towered over her son with glossy eyes. She clasped one of Izuku\u2019s hands while Uraraka grabbed another, and shot a watery smile down at him. \u201cIzu, you have no idea how proud I am of you right now! It\u2019s so wonderful to see the two of you get along so well. Oh, my baby is actually on television!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah dude, this is manly as hell!\u201d Kirishima said, flashing him a thumbs up. Ashido, who was standing next to him, flung herself forward at Kacchan to hug him by the shoulders. Kacchan swore, having to practically hold Ashido up as she threw all of her weight at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBakuhoe, you\u2019re doing amazing sweetie!\u201d she laughed as she leant down to practically strangle the blond. \u201cWould you be able to answer questions about me? Hey, what do you think  my strangest fear is?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGet off me Pinky,\u201d he snarled, trying to loosen her ironclad grip on his neck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnswer meee!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be your biggest fucking nightmare if you don\u2019t let up right now, I swear to god-\u201d\n\u00a0\nAshido just laughed again, breaking free from Kacchan only to latch onto Kirishima\u2019s arm. \u201cThe answer was straight people, Baku. Gah, he\u2019s so edgy. It\u2019s kind of cute though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Kirishima snickered, before glancing at Kacchan\u2019s murderous eyes. He not so subtly placed his hands on his girlfriend\u2019s shoulders before moving her in front of him as a precautionary wall of defence.\n\u00a0\nIzuku snorted. \u201cYeah, he is,\u201d he agreed absentmindedly, lips twitching upwards into a soft smile. For a brief second, he tilted his head in confusion as all pairs of eyes latched on to him before realising what he had just said.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Kacchan asked, sounding just as confused. Izuku didn\u2019t even dare to look at him, his eyes darting towards everything in the room  except for him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(Inko\u2019s cheeks bloomed into a soft pink when she noticed the look on her son\u2019s face. And  oh,  she thought,  why am I not surprised?) \n\u00a0\n\u201cUh-\u201d Izuku stuttered out, \u201cI just meant-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeku,\u201d Uraraka stepped in, eyes locked on to something on stage, \u201cI think you both need to head back now...\u201d Izuku followed her gaze to the front, where Hanazawa was just finishing up with her hair stylist as the camera crew reorganised themselves into position again.\n\u00a0\nHe shot her a grateful smile and squeezed her hand before pulling away to face Kacchan.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with then,\u201d Kacchan grunted. Then, before he could think too much about it, Kacchan extended his hand towards Izuku and curled it into a fist.\n\u00a0\nIzuku stared at it for a second with wide eyes before dissolving into a smile as he fist bumped him. \u201cHere\u2019s to ten out of ten,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\nOnce they were seated and had a five second touch up by their respective stylists again, Izuku drew in a deep inhale to gather himself as the cameras began rolling again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWelcome back to  Heroes Rising!  Currently on stage with us are the rising pro heroes Deku and Ground Zero who have not only smashed their way through the rankings this year, but are apparently also on course to beating the show\u2019s record for the game  Do You Really Know Me?  on their very first go! We\u2019re in the homestretch now, boys. Are we ready for the eighth question?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan grunted in lieu of an actual response as Izuku beamed up at Hanazawa. \u201cTotally!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cThis is super exciting, isn\u2019t it Kacchan?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be more exciting once we win,\u201d he retorted, twirling his pen in his fingers impatiently.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKacchan is so enthusiastic,\u201d Izuku muttered quietly. At least the crowd seemed to be eating up their dynamic, though.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright heroes, on to question number eight. What does your partner think is your least flattering colour to wear?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku grimaced at Kacchan\u2019s very unappealing scowl. He didn\u2019t look camera friendly at  all. Again. Not that Izuku had ever expected him to. \u201cWhat kind of a dumb question is that? Does this look like a fashion runway show?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think it\u2019s interesting,\u201d Izuku interjected. \u201cAnd I know the answer to it too, so I like it even more because of that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe blond glared at him silently before resigning himself to just writing down his answer, mumbling \u201cNobody asked for your dumb opinion,\u201d as he did so.\n\u00a0\nIzuku laughed to himself, because he knew that Kacchan\u2019s irritation was going to bleed into his answer, which meant his answer was definitely going to be a dig at him. When time was up, the cameras zoomed onto Izuku\u2019s screen first.\n\u00a0\n \u2018Kacchan doesn\u2019t like to wear yellow because he thinks it clashes with his hair,' was written at the top, and a  \u2018Kacchan thinks every colour is unflattering on me.'\n\u00a0\nKacchan\u2019s board sported a very curt  \u2018yellow\u2019  at the bottom and a  \u2018bold of anyone to assume Deku can wear flattering colours\u2019  was scribbled quickly at the top, as if he had been running out of time to get it down.\n\u00a0\nHanazawa was laughing even as she said, \u201cThat\u2019s  mean, Bakugou!\u201d Turning to Izuku, her eyebrows rose to her hairline at what was written on his board. \u201cOh, so Bakugou cares about his appearance, then?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku snorted. \u201cUmm, it\u2019s more like his parents are both fashion designers, so I guess he always had an eye for this kind of stuff?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh!\u201d Hanazawa exclaimed, turning to face Kacchan who was staring at Deku with a betrayed expression. \u201cYou know, you could\u2019ve made a total fortune out of being a model working for your parents! At least you know what to do if heroing doesn\u2019t work out for you-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cHAH?!-\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe\u2019s  joking,  Kacchan, everyone knows that you\u2019re destined to be a hero!\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan sat back down, since he had apparently almost risen out of his seat, grumbling something about  damn right he was  and  who does this lady think she is to even suggest something so stupid. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nUnfazed by the near-outburst, the airy host continued without a hitch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay let\u2019s see,\u201d Hanazawa pretended to skim the page as Kaji\u2019s voice filtered into her ear. She and Kaji had agreed during the break that the questions on the page were apparently  easy  for this freak duo, and that they needed to spice things up a little so that the audience didn\u2019t think it was all staged. But at the same time, they shouldn\u2019t be hard enough that the pair of them broke the streak, either. Imagine a full, perfect score on  Heroes Rising!  It\u2019s never been done before, so ratings would absolutely go through the roof.\n\u00a0\n \u201cI\u2019m literally on Google right now,\u201d  Kaji began, and Hanazawa suppressed the need to yell at him,  \u201cbut hey this looks good - wait no, this one. Not too hard, not too easy. Ask them about the one secret they know about each other which nobody else knows. They\u2019re childhood friends, they\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a good thing Kaji talked like an auctioneer on crack because Hanazawa would\u2019ve killed anyone else who took so long to give her directions.\n\u00a0\n\u201cQuestion number nine: what is one secret that your partner has personally told you that nobody else knows?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan and Izuku exchanged a glance.\n\u00a0\n One For All,  Izuku thought instantly. Then - no, All Might knew about that. As did Recovery Girl, and all the others too. Besides, Kacchan had figured that out all on his own. Izuku allowed himself a second to admire Kacchan\u2019s observational skills before getting back to the task at hand.\n\u00a0\nChildhood memories didn\u2019t really count either, right? Knowing that Kacchan usually woke up in the night to pee wasn\u2019t a secret that he had personally told him, it was just a fact that he had come to know.\n\u00a0\nThree memories flickered into his mind at the speed of light. (Any and all memories involving Kacchan always sat, somehow, at the forefront of his mind for easy access).\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOne:  \u201cWhy was I the one who ended All Might?\u201d \n\u00a0\nIzuku shivered, pushing that memory aside. Nobody apart from him needed to know about that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe second:  \u201cI\u2019m gay.\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe had to fight the rising blush to his cheeks. When he made eye contact with Kacchan, and noticed the red tips of his ears, they both looked hastily away as they realised what the other was thinking.\n\u00a0\nThe third one was, luckily, so much more innocent. Endearing, even, or maybe Izuku\u2019s thoughts were an unreliable narrator because he happened to find just about anything that Kacchan did as endearing.\n\u00a0\n\n Kacchan was tapping his finger on the coffee table in the common room, a whirlwind of books and papers scattered around them. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cLook, I\u2019m not \u2026 the best at history, alright? Like, who gives a fuck about some old man who kicked the bucket hundreds of years ago? Just- help me out with this shit.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to help you? Kacchan, are you ill?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cShut the fuck up before I change my mind. If I tell anyone else about this they wouldn\u2019t let me live it down.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\u2018Bad at history,\u2019  Izuku wrote at the top now, smiling as he did so. Now for the hard part.\n\u00a0\nThe things that Izuku had told Kacchan personally were much too serious to be discussed on live television. Izuku\u2019s secrets were dark and dangerous things, bigger than the both of them and just barely deep enough to wade through. And though Kacchan knew more about him than anyone else did, that was mainly because Kacchan could read him like a book in the same way Izuku could read him. There wasn\u2019t really a need to confide in him with words when he already knew-\n\u00a0\nOh. There was  one thing that Izuku had told him.\n\u00a0\nIzuku could feel the tips of his ears burning as he sneaked a quick glance at Kacchan, who was leaning back in his seat as he looked back smugly. Ugh, of  course he would. Of course Izuku would take care to make sure Kacchan\u2019s reputation was intact, but the blond would want to do exactly the opposite of that. Frowning, Izuku scribbled down his answer at the bottom quickly, conscious of the time he wasted in thought.\n\u00a0\nHanazawa signalled that time was up just as Izuku squeezed in the last word. When time was up, Izuku tried to hide behind his fingers as their answers revealed themselves on the screen.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeku! You sleep with a giant All Might plushie? To be expected from the self-proclaimed fanboy!\u201d The crowd went a little wild at that, bursting into their signature sounds of endearment. One audience member shouted  \u2018Detroit Smash!\u2019  which led to a round of cheers and more laughter. It seemed that the All Might obsession never really wore down with the people of Musutafu, even after his retirement.\n\u00a0\n I hate you Kacchan,  Izuku thought bitterly. When he brought his hands down to expose his face, he scowled at the blond sitting across from him. Kacchan\u2019s screen read \u2018he sleeps with a giant All Might plushie  \u2019 followed by  \u2018I hate history more than I hate Deku\u2019s face .\u2019\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI just really admire him,\u201d Izuku said, trying not to pout. He wasn\u2019t sure what it said about him as the future Symbol of Peace when he still slept with a giant toy, but he had a feeling it wasn\u2019t a good one.\n\u00a0\nEven though Kacchan had exposed him to the world, Izuku didn\u2019t have much time to feel mad about it. They were on the last question now. The moment they\u2019ve been  waiting for. \n\u00a0\n\u201cAre we all ready for the last question? We have never gotten a full score for this game before, but our first time rookies might just put every other hero duo in their place! We will be increasing the time for this question to 45 seconds, just because this is the first time this has ever happened and we think you\u2019ve both earned it. Can we get one final cheer for heroes Ground Zero and Deku, who have played phenomenally this entire time?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku drowned out the cheers as he smiled confidently at Kacchan. They managed to get this far, and he was feeling much more excited than he was nervous for once.\n\u00a0\nThey were going to get 8 million yen!\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, then, here we go.\u201d Hanazawa paused for a dramatic effect as the lights dimmed and spotlights overhead honed in on their podiums. Izuku was surprised to find that the pressure of the spotlights didn\u2019t actually bother him now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is \u2026 your hero partner\u2019s type?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA brief silence.\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2018Type?\u2019\u201d Izuku questioned at the same time as Kacchan. Hanazawa smiled at their synchrony, waving her hands at the camera as if to say  Are y\u2019all seeing this too? \n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, type,\u201d she laughed. \u201cLike, who would they date? What are they into?\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor a second, all he heard was the hum of the air conditioner in the distance. Then, the blood drained from Izuku\u2019s face and he shot a panicked look at Kacchan. The blond didn\u2019t seem to be faring any better, his gaze zeroed in on Hanazawa as if he could will her to change the question to something else.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n I \u2026 I don\u2019t know the answer to this. I don\u2019t  know  the answer! Oh god, I don\u2019t know the- \n\u00a0\n\u201cTime starts now. Good luck!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku gulped thickly, but his throat was tight and the action was more painful than anything. The blank screen staring up at him was an exact reflection of the static in his head. Kacchan\u2019s type? That was something Izuku didn\u2019t ever think of. It\u2019s not something he had ever  wanted  to think about. Izuku knows he gets jealous easily, especially when it comes to  him. \n\u00a0\n\n Think Izuku! Think! Okay, he told you he was gay. And Kacchan \u2026 he\u2019s focused on being the best, which means that he wants someone who can be on his level - oh right haha no, nope, not going there. This is no time for self-indulgent fantasies. \n\n\u00a0\nAh! He likes \u2026 manly people? People who are strong, someone who can take a villain down in one swoop.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s eyes flicked to the dark audience. Kirishima is taken though. Unless \u2026 it\u2019s unrequited? No, wait, it can be literally anyone from U.A. Wait! This is about his type, not who he likes. Ugh, I hate this question so much. But - maybe it\u2019s a trick question? Maybe Kacchan just doesn\u2019t have types at all! Izuku smiled gleefully to himself at the thought. Yeah, that makes sense, he\u2019s never expressed interest in anyone before.\n\u00a0\nWait. There had been a party in second year once. Izuku distinctly remembered Ashido joking about if Kacchan would ever \u2018tap that,\u2019 and Kacchan had said \u2018Are you thick? Of course I would.\u2019  Does that count? Who were we even talking about? What is a type? Is his type - I don\u2019t want to think about this. I don\u2019t want to think- \n\u00a0\n\u201cTime\u2019s up!\u201d\n\u00a0\nOh god. Izuku fucked up. He  fucked up.  He didn\u2019t even think about his  own type which- huh. Did he have one? It was a little difficult to identify what Izuku\u2019s type was when nobody could ever hold a candle to Kacchan, to his spiky hair that was actually soft to the touch, and his toned, sculpted biceps, and how his cupid bow lips were always tucked into a frown even when he was happy because god forbid anyone see him smile-\n\u00a0\nOh god. He fucked up!\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s podium buzzed pathetically from the lack of response. Blood roared in Izuku\u2019s ears from both the embarrassment and the flood of his thoughts.\n\u00a0\nThe crowd was silent for once.\n\u00a0\n Just look at Kacchan\u2019s screen,  Izuku pleaded with himself. His eyes remained glued to his own blank screen.  Just do it. Look, Izuku! He knows you better than you know yourself, right? Obviously, he would have guessed- \n\u00a0\nHis eyes flicked upwards. Kacchan was avoiding his eyes too, face uncharacteristically blank with shock. Izuku\u2019s eyes fell to the screen.\n\u00a0\n\n \u2018Brown hair?\u2019\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\nThere was nothing written at the bottom.\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s heart stopped beating, and then it took a dive into his gut. \u2018Brown hair ?\u2019 Where did Kacchan get that from? Finally, their eyes met. And for the first time that night, neither one of them had any idea what the other was thinking, or what they were trying to communicate to each other.\n\u00a0\nTo be fair, Izuku wasn\u2019t sure what he was trying to say either.  Sorry I don\u2019t think about what your type is because it makes my heart ache? Sorry that my sexuality is apparently Kacchan-sexual? Yikes. At least Kacchan had got it wrong too, though. That was a small comfort.\n\u00a0\n(Inwardly, Hanazawa cursed. She cursed Kaji most of all for thinking this question would be easy.  \u2018C\u2019mon, what kind of best buddies don\u2019t talk about their crushes? Tell me you\u2019ve never done that in a sleepover. Now look at them and tell me  they\u2019ve  never had a sleepover. It\u2019s a good one, trust me. When have I ever failed you?\u2019 To think they could\u2019ve gotten so many views on YouTube for this! Should she fire him? Okay, too far maybe. She\u2019s definitely not paying for drinks tonight though).\n\u00a0\n\u201cAww,\u201d Hanazawa said finally, the disappointment evident in her voice even as she smiled reassuringly. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a shame, guys! And I thought you two would have this in the bag.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNeither of her contestants responded to her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe wondered briefly if she should push it, maybe ask them what their types actually are - the audience would  eat that up like animals  - but the looks on their faces rendered her merciful. Ah, young love. \u201cC\u2019mon heroes, nine out of ten is still a record breaker, no need to look so glum! You both have effectively won the game, which means you win those surprise gifts from the audience!\u201d\n\u00a0\nInstantly, the studio flights flooded the room once more and confetti fell ceremoniously from above. Izuku didn\u2019t really hear the applause or whatever Hanazawa was saying next. He couldn\u2019t really quell the trembling in his fingers either.\n\u00a0\nKacchan\u2019s  type. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nOut of all the questions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku blinked as a box as tall as himself was shoved into his arms and as a small one was placed into Kacchan\u2019s hands by two staff members. He registered Hanazawa\u2019s instruction to tear open the wrapping and show the camera, which he did so robotically.\n\u00a0\nHuh. He got a coat hanger stand. This would be good for his mother.\n\u00a0\nKacchan was staring unimpressed at the mini electrical muscle-massager in his box. Hanazawa was joking about how he could use it to ease up the tense muscles in his face, and Izuku saw the way Kacchan barely managed to restrain himself from blowing it up entirely at the comment.\n\u00a0\nForcing his All Might smile on his face one last time, he thanked Hanazawa for the prizes and waved goodbye at the crowd and the cameras.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen the cameras stopped rolling, the studio quietly settled down as the crew readied themselves for the upcoming interviews.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know you boys must be disappointed,\u201d Hanazawa said, flopping down on the armchair tiredly in the other part of the studio. Her makeup artist knelt beside her chair, dabbing at her cheeks hurriedly for the next segment of the show.  \u201cBut  you still broke our record. This game isn\u2019t easy, you know. There\u2019s a reason the record is six.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Kacchan grumbled. He exchanged a look at Izuku. \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku looked away immediately.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRight.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s just a stupid game.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy the time the group exited the building, it was already dusk. They didn\u2019t bother sticking around for the rest of the show, mostly because the mood was a little too forlorn for anyone\u2019s liking, but also partly because Uraraka and Ashido were running late for Hagakure\u2019s late birthday party and wanted to leave as soon as possible.\n\u00a0\nUraraka wrapped her hands around Izuku\u2019s neck after they descended into the car park, squeezing him tightly. Izuku knew she was feeling a little sorry for him, even if she was confused as to why Kacchan and him were acting so gloomy about the outcome of a  game.  He couldn\u2019t really give her an answer as to why, either.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to call Tsu later, alright?\u201d Uraraka said, pulling back and giving Izuku\u2019s shoulders a squeeze. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one she can talk to about that new amphibian hero. The way she gushes about him reminds me too much of you- I just can\u2019t keep track of anything she\u2019s saying.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku smiled. \u201cSure thing, Uraraka.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll talk later then! Bye, Ms. Midoriya-san, thanks for the ride today!\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe smiled at Inko, saluted at Kacchan who was watching her warily the whole time, and bounded after Ashido and Kirishima, who were rummaging through some bags in their car\u2019s trunk- probably checking to see if everything was there for Hagakure\u2019s gathering.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKirishima was grumbling a little about how he felt left out in just dropping the two over before going back to his apartment alone, but Ashido distracted him with a smattering of kisses all over his face. He pulled away looking positively giddy, all pouty-ness forgotten as he waved goodbye to Izuku, Kacchan and Inko and pulled out of the car park. Izuku thought he heard Kacchan whisper  \u2018whipped\u2019  under his breath.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKatsuki-kun?\u201d They both turned towards Inko, who was standing quietly next to Izuku with the box with the coat hanger clutched awkwardly in her hands since the box was towering over her. \u201cWould you like a ride home, since yours just left?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHonestly, Izuku thought he could never get tired of the way Kacchan acted so awkwardly around his mother. Izuku had told Inko all about their renewed friendship, and of course, Inko had understood and forgiven him, but it was always apparent that Kacchan had probably never expected her forgiveness.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSometimes, Izuku thought that Kacchan felt like he didn\u2019t deserve to be forgiven at all.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm,\u201d Kacchan scratched the back of his neck. \u201cNo thank you Auntie\u2026 I was actually thinking of going to eat some ramen or something and just ... go home after that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh!\u201d Inko seemed to positively light up at this, hands threading together. \u201cIn that case, the two of you should come over! It\u2019s been so long since we\u2019ve all had a meal together. I\u2019ll make you a nice-\u201d Inko stopped abruptly, a flash of something flickering across her face.\n\u00a0\nIzuku furrowed his brows. \u201cYou\u2019ll-?\u201d\n\u00a0\nInko\u2019s eyes flicked between the two of them before something finally dawned on her face. \u201cAh, silly me.\u201d Her hands moved slowly down to her hips, and a soft smile drew her lips up. \u201cI\u2019m \u2026 actually meeting with, uh, Mitsuki ... today. Wow, I completely forgot. Whoops. Old age, you know? Anyway! I\u2019ll be heading off then, but you two can go eat dinner together, alright?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan\u2019s nose scrunched up while Inko was talking, and Izuku appreciated that he was looking like his regular self again. \u201cYou\u2019re meeting with the hag?\u201d he said distastefully.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe\u2019s the most wonderful hag I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of meeting,\u201d Inko replied easily. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Inko launched herself at her son, holding him tightly with her face pressed into his chest.\n\u00a0\nIzuku startled a little, but quickly enveloped her in a warm hug. He pressed his face into his mother\u2019s hair, closing his eyes briefly at her comforting touch. She was always so-\n\u00a0\nWhy was she crying?\n\u00a0\nIzuku pulled back to ask if something was wrong, but Inko had extracted herself from Izuku\u2019s grip in favour of launching herself at Kacchan. The blond was not so quick to return the favour. He shot a look at Izuku over Inko\u2019s head, the question obvious in his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\n Why is she fucking hugging me? Deku, get her off me- \n\n\u00a0\nHe just shrugged in response, just as lost. Inko was hugging Kacchan for much longer than what was usual .  When she pulled back, she dabbed at her eyes quickly. \u201cAh, they grow up so fast,\u201d she mumbled. Kacchan had never looked more confused.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAuntie...?\u201d\n\u00a0\nInko looked up at him with a watery smile, before placing an arm on his shoulder. \u201cYou take good care of my Izu, alright?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d His eyes flicked over to Izuku\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s just ramen.\u201d\n\u00a0\nInko snorted. \u201cYes, it\u2019s just ramen,\u201d she repeated, a little cryptic. Then, taking Izuku\u2019s right hand and Kacchan\u2019s left, Inko squeezed their palms. \u201cAfter everything you two have been through together \u2026 I\u2019m so very proud of the both of you and I will support you no matter  what.  I hope you know that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen his mother\u2019s tiny car skidded speedily out of the parking lot - Inko was not a slow driver, so to speak - the two of them watched her go in a bemused daze. \u201cSome mother you got there, Deku.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe huffed out a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s probably why she gets along so well with yours.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan smirked. \u201c...Like mother, like son.\u201d\n\u00a0\nStartled, Izuku\u2019s eyes darted up to look at Kacchan. The blond was looking right back, the smirk still in place.\n\u00a0\n\n When did this parking lot get so warm? \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA few months ago, Kacchan and he had discovered a small roadside ramen shop situated at the back of Kacchan\u2019s apartment block. The food was killer, but it was more importantly secluded and hidden away in a nondescript alley, safe from civilian eyes. It also offered a sort of shortcut into a park leading towards Kacchan\u2019s house, so at least it was in walking distance and they didn\u2019t have to use their quirks to jump over roofs just to get home.\n\u00a0\nAs the sun finally sank into the horizon, the two of them sat side by side on the bar stools in front of the nearly empty kitchen, bowls of steaming ramen half eaten before them. The place was practically deserted apart from the two heroes and the young woman busying herself by preparing the kitchen for the next day.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, apparently jellyfish only live for one year,\u201d Izuku was saying, one chopstick poking at his cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I thought it would be for longer than that, but I guess it makes sense if you think about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShoving another mouthful of noodles in his mouth, Kacchan pulled a face. \u201cIt should be zero years.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cKacchan, you really need to get over that day on the beach.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe fuck? Maybe  you  should get over your fear of freaking  flowers,  damn hypocrite. Jellyfish are so much deadlier than a damn leaf. And the creepy fuckers don\u2019t even have  brains.\u201d \n\u00a0\nIzuku hummed, amused. \u201cFair enough.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA silence fell on them as they ate, and suddenly it was becoming apparent that they were both avoiding the elephant in the room. They simultaneously put their chopsticks down and turned to each other, the words already on their lips.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, what exactly-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeku, what  is-\u201d \n\u00a0\nThey stopped, blinked, looked away. Kacchan craned his neck up to stare at the ceiling.\n\u00a0\n\u201cChrist, Deku. Have we always been like this?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe blond turned to look at him, waving a hand incredulously between them. \u201cLike  this.  Talking at the same time like a couple of freaky fucking twins. It\u2019s so annoying.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku thought about it for a second, before shrugging and absently picking at his food again. \u201cDunno. Nothing really feels any different, so maybe it\u2019s just that we notice it more now because of the show?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan grunted. \u201cRight. About that. What  is your type?\u201d\n\u00a0\n(Neither of them noticed the way the woman in the kitchen paused mid-bend as she picked up a box of green onions to listen in. Could you really blame her? Practically everyone in Musutafu had been watching  Heroes Rising  tonight).\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s ears burned at the bluntness of his friend\u2019s words. \u201cI - um, ah\u2026\u201d  I like people who \u2026 are named Kacchan? Or Bakugou Katsuki, actually. Just give me a mean, spiky haired childhood friend who can practically be an extension of me in battle. It\u2019s not a hard requirement to meet!  \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you try to guess?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan snorted, eyes concentrated as he balanced pieces of chilli on his noodles before eating them. \u201cRight. Because apparently I\u2019d know the answer to that.\u201d Wordlessly, Izuku dropped the pieces of chill from his own bowl into Kacchan\u2019s, to which the blond grunted a  \u2018thanks\u2019  at.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh well, try to guess something other than brown hair, then? Speaking of, why did you even-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you have a thing for Round Face in high school?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s cheeks flamed. \u201cK-Kacchan! That was literally in first year! And  wow that feels so long ago, I can\u2019t believe you even remembered that\u2026 but anyway, super outdated!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo - what?\u201d Kacchan talked from around his food, which he knew would annoy Izuku, \u201cYou got a thing for happy go-lucky balls of sunshine or something?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEvery fibre of Izuku\u2019s being fought not to laugh at that. \u201cNot really,\u201d he said, the smile escaping him anyway.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou like \u2018em quiet and boring then?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhat on earth was Kacchan- oh. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about Todoroki-kun, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan scowled, stabbing his ramen as he grumbled, \u201cDuh. Nobody more boring than that half-and-half motherfucker.\u201d Still scowling, Kacchan\u2019s voice got quieter and quieter the more he grumbled. \u201cI bet he eats quadratic formulas for dinner and then proceeds to watch lame, boring-ass videos of\u2026 fucking\u2026 how to make a doorknob or something.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think  How It\u2019s Made  episodes are interesting, actually.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay.\u201d He chewed thoughtfully. \u201cSo you  do like boring ass-\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku rolled his eyes and poked Kacchan in the shoulder with a chopstick. \u201cStop calling him that, I  know  you\u2019re his friend. And no,  I\u2019m not into him like that.\u201d He paused, contemplating the thought. \u201cHe is very pretty though.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku was already reaching for another chopstick from the tray in front of them as the one in Kacchan\u2019s chopstick snapped in half. \u201cGeez Kacchan, you\u2019re so wound up today. Also, uh, sorry to make you guess like that. I guess the real answer is that I don\u2019t really have a type? Or, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve ever really thought about.\u201d\n\u00a0\n It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve ever had the  need  to think about. \n\u00a0\n\u201cFigures,\u201d Kacchan said, a little vaguely. \u201cAnyway, guess my type then.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s mood dampened at this, even though he should\u2019ve expected it from asking Kacchan in the first place. He really didn\u2019t want to do this. But of course, Kacchan was fixing him with one of his signature Intense Stares, so Izuku couldn\u2019t really squirm his way out of it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm.. You like strong guys?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe fuck Deku? Obviously. That\u2019s low hanging fruit.\u201d\n\u00a0\n \u201cExcuse  me,\u201d Izuku frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s so much better than just  brown hair  and someone who\u2019s  boring.  At least mine makes sense and relates to your character!\u201d\n\u00a0\nSensing the threat of defeat, Kacchan shrugged it off. \u201cWhatever. Just keep going.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Izuku breathed in, ate a bit more, and swallowed thoughtfully. \u201cYou\u2019d like someone who\u2019s got a really badass quirk, or something. Maybe they were prodigies when they were children too, just like you. And they honed their power over the years so they could be the greatest hero. It could be anyone from U.A, actually, since you\u2019d only go for the best of the best. And I guess they won\u2019t be annoying? I know you hate how annoying I am, so they\u2019d have to be more than just  tolerable.  Not that anyone in particular comes to mind since everyone seems to annoy you...\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan said nothing for a while, having taken a great interest in the egg floating in his broth. Izuku internally gave himself a moment to laugh at the way Kacchan always saved the egg for last, before he nervously looked back at his face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWas I \u2026. uh, close?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe egg disappeared inside Kacchan\u2019s mouth. \u201cNot really,\u201d he said, muffled from around the food. Kacchan was still avoiding his eyes, it seemed.\n\u00a0\nIzuku blinked. \u201cOh.\u201d Huh, he really thought he had hit it on the nail there.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLooking up at the clock, Izuku hummed when he realised it was nearly 10pm. It was a wonder, really, how Kacchan was managing to stay awake at this time for non-hero work related purposes. \u201cAnyway, we should probably leave soon. We don\u2019t want to make this nice lady work overtime for our sake.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan grunted a  \u2018yeah\u2019  and then the two of them were scraping their chairs back as they stood up. Izuku bowed and quickly thanked the woman in the kitchen, who had paused her work to bid the heroes goodbye, and then they were stepping out into the night.\n\u00a0\nAs they stopped by the street, Izuku hesitated by the mouth of the alleyway. \u201cAh.. are you headed home now, Kacchan?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey just stood there awkwardly for some seconds too long. Izuku really didn\u2019t want to say goodbye so early. He really,  really  wanted to just stay by Kacchan\u2019s side for a while longer. The latter seemed to be having the same thought as he hadn\u2019t ditched Izuku to leave. In fact, he was just bouncing side-to-side on his heels.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, see ya later then, Deku.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Yeah,\u201d Izuku sighed, deflating. \u201cLater, Kacchan.\u201d Smiling at his friend one last time, Izuku turned on his heel and began to walk in the other direction.\n\u00a0\nJust as he was beginning to activate his quirk so he could leap over the buildings, Kacchan swore quietly behind him. \u201cDeku, wait.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku, ever so honed into Kacchan\u2019s every move, paused immediately to turn around. The green electricity emanating from his body dissipated immediately. \u201cYes, Kacchan?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith one hand stuffed into his pocket, and the other gripping his neck, Kacchan didn\u2019t meet his eye when he said, \u201cDid you want to, uh, hang out? At my place?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYES!\u201d Izuku beamed, bounding up to Kacchan immediately. Upon seeing the blond raise an eyebrow at the excitement, Izuku sheepishly tried to dial down his wild expression. Yikes, talk about looking desperate. \u201cI mean - uh, yeah. We can watch that Ms. Joke sitcom together, if you want? Apparently they released a special episode last week but I was so swamped with work that it completely slipped my mind and I still haven\u2019t gotten the chance to see it...\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku rambled on like that as they crossed the street and made their way into the empty park, which was the shortest route to Kacchan\u2019s apartment district. The trail they were walking down was surprisingly well lit, considering the budget for this part of town.\n\u00a0\nWhen mosquitoes started nipping at Kacchan\u2019s neck, the scent of nitroglycerin permeated the air as Kacchan launched into several variations of  DIE  and  EAT SHIT, YOU INSECT BASTARDS as he blasted with scary accuracy at barely-visible flying insects. Just the sight of it was enough to send Izuku into a laughing fit, doubling over instantly as the giggles took hold of him.\n\u00a0\nWhen he looked back up, wiping at his eyes, Kacchan had lowered his arms and was looking at him with a strange expression.\n\u00a0\nIt came out as a sigh. \u201cDeku.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI actually do have a type.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku stopped walking, heart dropping into his stomach. His friend followed suit, hands burrowing themselves in his pockets again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou do?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe nodded, looking a little out of his depth. Izuku could tell because his jaw was tight, his shoulders angled away from him, his eyes trained downwards. To the reasonable observer, Kacchan would\u2019ve looked bored, aloof, a little contemplative. But Izuku could see right through it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Kacchan was sounding less sure of himself now. Despite the uncertainty, he pressed on. \u201cI do like strong guys, you were right about that. Strong enough that it scares me a little, makes me realise that maybe I\u2019m not... that I\u2019ve still got a lot left to prove. But it\u2019s fine because it keeps me on my toes.\u201d He breathed in deeply, tilting his head to the side. \u201cIt\u2019s  fine because I know that no matter what happens, they\u2019ll always be by my side, even when I\u2019m fucking everything up. Because-\u201d he swallowed tightly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause they\u2019ve seen all the worst parts of me, and they\u2019re still there.  They\u2019re still fucking there.  Despite everything, they\u2019ve made it clear that they\u2019re never even going to leave now that they\u2019ve gotten so far. I think my  type  is someone who\u2019s so goddamn self sacrificial and forgiving that it grates on my  fucking nerves.  Someone who sprinted at me because they saw me in danger even though they were fucking  quirkless  and I was nothing but an exceptional asshole to them the entire time. Someone who always looks at me like I hung the stars for them, even  before things got better between us because he\u2019s apparently a masochistic little shit.\u201d Kacchan took in a shaky breath, finally risking a glance over at Izuku.\n\u00a0\nIzuku, who had said nothing, whose face was betraying nothing. Under the streetlight, Izuku looked utterly expressionless, apart from his widened transfixed eyes. For what felt like eternity, they remained locked in each other\u2019s stare.\n\u00a0\nUntil finally, the silence became unbearable. \u201c...Deku?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku opened his mouth but found no words. \u201cI-\u201d The rest of the thoughts lodged themselves painfully in his throat. He could barely hear anything past the ringing in his ears.\n\u00a0\nKacchan recoiled as if he\u2019d been struck, whipping backwards as rejection painted itself all over his face. \u201cRight, well, I\u2019m s-\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd then the world came suddenly rushing back in, the crisp autumn air clearing the clutter in his head. \u201cUm, I have a type too.\u201d Izuku didn\u2019t look at him.\n\u00a0\nSilence.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Kacchan rolled his shoulders back, that dejected expression never leaving. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh.\u201d Izuku raised his arms, trying to articulate with the help of his very coherent hand gestures. \u201cTemperamental, apparently. And a little emotionally constipated, but it\u2019s okay because that\u2019s just who they are and it\u2019s definitely not as bad as it used to be. Um, I\u2019ve always been used to it too, so it\u2019s not something I couldn\u2019t handle anyway. And - heh. I guess I like them strong too? A true hero who can win to save, and always have my back in battle, and keep me grounded when I\u2019m panicking, and give me those little private smiles that are  so rare  but they\u2019re so special to me, and um-\u201d Izuku cut himself off at the absolutely floored expression Kacchan was giving him, those red eyes round with surprise. Should - should he make it clearer? \u201cUm. You - they know me really well? Childhood friends? Red eyes? Last name Bakugou, first name - ah, you know I can\u2019t say it. Kacchan, d-do you get what I\u2019m trying to-\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan held Deku\u2019s chin with his thumb and forefinger, looming over him. \u201cDeku,\u201d he said roughly, eyes dropping to Izuku\u2019s lips. \u201cLet\u2019s stop beating around the bush.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHeat rushed to Izuku\u2019s face as he nodded vigorously. The streetlight above them was haloing Kacchan in a golden light, and Izuku thought that maybe the roof had collapsed over Hanazawa\u2019s studio and he had died and was now living his best life in heaven, because there\u2019s no way Kacchan could ever be looking at him like that. But then he was moving forward and Kacchan was leaning in, and when their lips met in the middle Izuku was certain that he\u2019d never felt anything more real.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe took Kacchan\u2019s face in his hands, reveling in the softness of his skin and the realisation that he\u2019s known him all his life but has never known just how tender Kacchan\u2019s lips could be. He shuddered at the thought that he still had so much left to  learn  about him. That there was still so much left to  explore.  Izuku became weightless and untethered, Kacchan holding him down like a lifeline, those warm hands pressed insistently against Izuku\u2019s back, pulling him in impossibly closer.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s only when Kacchan began sliding his tongue in between Izuku\u2019s lips to kiss him more deeply that Izuku pulled away, breathless. Crimson eyes stared back at him, but the sheer lack of distance between their faces was making Izuku cross-eyed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cW-wait. Kacchan?\u201d he asked, cringing at the way his voice sounded absolutely ragged.\n\u00a0\nKacchan took a second to just look at him, probably admiring his handwork. He kissed the corner of Izuku\u2019s lips as if he couldn\u2019t really help himself. \u201cWhat?\u201d Izuku was comforted to hear that Kacchan sounded just as wrecked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoes this mean you like me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my fucking god.\u201d Kacchan pulled back, his expression melting into annoyance again. \u201cYou are the dumbest motherfucker to ever walk this earth, I swear to god, Deku.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku blinked. \u201cSaying things like that is not really helping your case, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKacchan just shut his eyes for a quick second at this, mouth twisting briefly into one of his rare smiles, his expression uncharacteristically fond. \u201cLook. I don\u2019t go around confessing my feelings and kissing people in a park like some fucking sap to just  anyone.\u201d  Then, brushing a stray curl away from Izuku\u2019s forehead, he tacked on a truly affectionate: \u201cDumbass.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe words made Izuku feel instantly giddy, and the goofy smile on his face did absolutely nothing to hide it. \u201cI\u2019d really hope not,\u201d he whispered, going on his tippy toes to kiss him on the cheek. \u201cI would have some choice words for them.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJealous much?\u201d And then he was pulling him in again, drinking Izuku in like he couldn\u2019t get enough. \u201cOi,\u201d he said in-between kisses, his voice octaves lower than normal, \u201cyou\u2019d better not still be thinking of watching that lame TV show when we get back to my place.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cK-Kacchan!\u201d Izuku didn\u2019t know what he looked like, but judging from how unbearably hot his face was he knew he looked positively crimson.  \u201cEager much?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShuddup, I\u2019ve wanted this for so long.\u201d He finally broke away, stepping back slightly. \u201cUnless, uh, you don\u2019t want to-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo!\u201d Izuku immediately grabbed onto Kacchan\u2019s hand, interlacing their fingers and giving him a reassuring squeeze. The warmth of his hand sent tingles down Izuku\u2019s spine, which in turn only made him smile wider. \u201cI mean- I do. Want to. But um, I\u2019m just saying that we could, y\u2019know\u2026 multitask too?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen it clicked in Kacchan\u2019s head, he groaned and buried his face in his free hand. \u201cI\u2019m not having sex with you with a fucking  Ms. Joke show playing in the background, what the fuck? Why am I so attracted to you? I want a refund.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLaughing, Izuku practically skipped all the way to Kacchan\u2019s house. \u201cI\u2019m just joking, Kacchan geez!\u201d  Half-joking, but he doesn\u2019t need to know that.  \u00a0 \n\u00a0\nThey might not have won the game show, but by the end of the night they had bared themselves so openly to one another that there were finally,  finally no more secrets left between them."
