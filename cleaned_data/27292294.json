    "text": "Megumi gets as far as kicking off his shoes and hanging up his jacket and calling out \u201cI\u2019m ho\u2014\u201c before he\u2019s immediately accosted in his own home. His greeting is cut off by a neatly manicured hand grabbing his face, dragging his gaze down a good couple of inches until he\u2019s brushing noses with Nobara. She\u2019s got a wild sort of panic in her eyes, a fire burning in them that sets off every single primal survival instinct in Megumi\u2019s head, all of them screaming danger, danger!\n \u201cHow does my makeup look.\u201d She growls, digging her nails into his cheek. Megumi blinks, squinting. He knows approximately fuck-all about makeup, but no matter how many times he tells Nobara that he\u2019s useless at this, she still insists that he\u2019s better than Yuuji at least in terms of attention to detail. He tries his best, noting the dark wings and the light pink shimmer and the powdered blush spotting her cheeks.\n \u201cUm. Maybe a little more?\u201d He suggests. Nobara grumbles, releasing him from her deadly clutches and storming back to her bedroom. Megumi feels the acute sense of relief that comes from surviving a bear attack, making an immediate beeline to the kitchen.\n \u201cI told you already, you look gre\u2014 oh hey Megumi!\u201d Yuuji grins from the stove. He catches sight of the look on Megumi\u2019s face and bursts into laughter, doubling over the pan he continues to steadily stir through his wheezes.\n \u201cIs she going to war or something?\u201d Megumi asks, bafflement clear in his voice. It makes Yuuji laugh harder. His ears are flushed, his eyes crinkled in the corners. \u201cSeriously, what\u2019s up with her.\u201d\n \u201cShe got a date with Maki-senpai.\u201d\n \u201cOh shit.\u201d\n \u201cBut not like, a date-date? Maki-senpai asked if she wanted to go try out a new cafe and when Nobara said yes Maki replied with \u2018it\u2019s a date!\u2019 and nothing else. So.\u201d\n \u201cOh shit.\u201d\n \u201cYeah.\u201d Yuuji says with another laugh, turning to face Megumi. He\u2019s got a spoon in one hand, rice piled on top, his other hand cupped beneath it to catch any stray grains. \u201cOpen.\u201d \n Megumi rolls his eyes but obliges. Yuuji pops the mouthful between his lips, watching his face intently. \u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d Megumi says as he chews, moderately surprised. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n \u201cShrimp fried rice.\u201d Yuuji licks his palm, dropping the spoon in the sink and turning around just in time to catch Megumi with a spoon of his own. \u201cNo. No you god damn animal, wait it\u2019ll be done soon.\u201d\n \u201cBut I\u2019m hungry.\u201d Megumi grumbles, inching towards the pan. He freezes when Yuuji picks up the towel on the counter, lifting it threateningly. \u201cJust one bite, c\u2019mon Yuuji.\u201d\n \u201cYou won\u2019t starve you big baby\u2014\u201c Yuuji cuts himself off with a yelp, darting forwards and snapping the towel against Megumi\u2019s arms as Megumi quickly snatches a spoonful of rice and stuffs it into his mouth. \u201cGod damn it Megumi!\u201d\n \u201cSorry.\u201d Megumi says around the rice.\n \u201cNo you\u2019re not.\u201d Yuuji sighs.\n \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Megumi agrees. Yuuji elbows him. Megumi elbows him back. It\u2019s like he can\u2019t stop the smile from creeping up his face, not as bright as the grin that pokes dimples into the corners of Yuuji\u2019s cheeks, but one just as fond and just as real. It\u2019s a side effect of the apartment, of the roommates he just so happened to have, he thinks.\n A loud and prolonged groan startles them both, they jolt in tandem and inadvertently knock their heads together. Blinking through the pain, Megumi turns and meets Nobara\u2019s eyes. She somehow looks entirely unimpressed and ready to fucking explode at the exact same time. \u201cHomosexuals.\u201d She says with the disdain of a Victorian noblewoman ready to punt an orphan across the road for touching her dress with grubby hands.\n \u201cI\u2019m bi!\u201d Yuuji chirrups with the enthusiasm of a grubby little Victorian orphan grabbing a noblewoman\u2019s dress to try and steal her purse.\n Nobara ignores him, which is something she\u2019s gotten down to a science at this point. She gives a twirl. \u201cRate the fit.\u201d Her tone is stand-offish and sour, but she\u2019s worrying her lip between her teeth and digging her nails into her own arm.\n \u201cYou look nice.\u201d Megumi says sincerely, because, well, she does. A white blouse tucked into a pink skirt with little black heels matching a black-knit cardigan. She\u2019s got her hair in buns like she\u2019s Sailor Moon. The words come out kinda flat and mean because he\u2019s really, really bad at this sort of thing, but Nobara\u2019s clearly lived with him long enough to get what he\u2019s going for, because she gives him a thankful grin instead of a swift kick in the nuts. He\u2019s rather glad, mostly because she really doesn\u2019t hold back when doling out punishment and those heels of hers look like they could do some serious damage.\n \u201cYou look great!\u201d Yuuji gives her two thumbs up and a big smile. \u201cSeriously, Maki-senpai won\u2019t know what hit her.\u201d\n Nobara sags with relief, stumbling over to their breakfast bar and hopping up onto one of the stools. \u201cIt took me forever to pick a skirt.\u201d She groans, resting her head on the counter. She\u2019s there for barely a moment before her head snaps up, shimmery eyes blown wide with horror. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m overdressed.\u201d She whispers.\n \u201cCompared to Maki? You probably will be.\u201d Megumi offers. Yuuji glares at him and unsubtly tries to smack him on the back of the head. \u201cOw, let me explain damn it. As far as I can remember Maki has trashed every skirt someone has tried to make her wear. She only owns joggers and jeans and maybe a nice pair of slacks. Emphasis on maybe.\u201d Megumi trails off, coughing, looking away. \u201cSo. Yeah. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re so awkward it physically hurts me.\u201d Nobara sighs, but there\u2019s something in her tone that makes Megumi look back. Confidence and comfort fills the arches and lines of her face, settling into their familiar grooves. She straightens, slapping herself lightly on the cheek, clambering off of the stool. \u201cOkay! I\u2019ve got this.\u201d\n Megumi feels the familiar weight of Yuuji\u2019s arm settling along his shoulders, a warmth that pulls him flush against Yuuji\u2019s side. What makes him freeze in place is the distinctly, unfamiliar sensation of his arm sliding down from his shoulder to fit in the dip of Megumi\u2019s waist. It makes him flinch. Yuuji barely seems to notice, too busy making a deep and exaggerated sniffle. \u201cThey grow up so fast, don\u2019t they?\u201d\n It\u2019s a lifetime of survival instinct and his inherent gift from compartmentalization that keeps Megumi from collapsing into the ground in a little puddle of man, despite every single cell in his body seemingly screaming at him to do so the moment the Yuuji\u2019s fingers settle in their place. Across from them, Nobara looks like she\u2019s about to throw up all over both of them. \u201cNo.\u201d She says with no small amount of venom. \u201cNo. Absolutely not. Stop this right now. Fuck off, both of you, right to hell, immediately.\u201d\n Yuuji\u2019s hand doesn\u2019t move from its place, but Megumi feels the shivers of his swallowed laughter rumbling through his frame. Still somewhat shell-shocked, running purely on auto-pilot, he mirrors Yuuji\u2019s motion, putting his hand on the curve of Yuuji\u2019s hip, tucking his thumb in his belt-loops, flatly saying, \u201cwatch your tone young lady.\u201d \n Yuuji jerks beneath his touch like he\u2019s been struck by lightning. Nobara looks ready to set fire to their apartment. \u201cI\u2019m disowning myself.\u201d She replies, positively murderous. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m drowning myself, because seriously. What the fuck.\u201d\n Yuuji\u2019s laughter breaks through his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to your father that way!\u201d He shouts with absolutely no anger, voice trembling with laughter around every word. Nobara\u2019s eyes flood with rage. Megumi bites back a smile of his own.\n \u201cI\u2019m leaving. I hope I come back to find you both dead.\u201d She spits, turning on her heel and storming out of the kitchen.\n \u201cYour curfew is at ten!\u201d Megumi feels compelled to reply. The only reply he gets is the front door firmly slamming shut. \u201cKids these days.\u201d He grumbles, and Yuuji dissolves into hysterics, throwing both arms around Megumi\u2019s chest and burying his face into Megumi\u2019s shoulder and nearly sending them both tumbling to the floor. \n \u201cD-did you see\u2014\u201c\n \u201cYuuji I\u2019m going to fall\u2014!\u201d\n \u201cHer face!\u201d He wheezes, almost in tears. He leans in a little closer, sending them both stumbling to the side. Megumi shoves at his head and tries to pry him off, steadfastly ignoring the way his heart skips a beat when Yuuji\u2019s breath brushes against his skin.\n \u201cShe\u2019s going to slaughter you.\u201d Megumi says, finally forcing Yuuji to stand mostly on his own. He can\u2019t quite push him off entirely, Yuuji seemingly determined to maintain at least three points of contact with Megumi at all times.\n \u201cWhat do you mean me, you went along with it too!\u201d\n \u201cI got infected by your stupidity.\u201d Megumi deadpans, unable to dodge out of the way of Yuuji\u2019s elbow which sends him stumbling back towards the pan, elbow catching the handle and sending its contents to the floor. \n Yuuji\u2019s scream is sharp and high pitched and brimming with despair and it makes Megumi sit there on the kitchen floor and put his head on his knees and laugh, hard enough that the swirling knot in his chest loosens and falls away, leaving nothing but his full bodied laughter and Yuuji\u2019s mournful gaze looking forlornly down at him like some kind of kicked puppy. He\u2019s too focused on getting air back into his lungs to even remember it happened.\n They sit together on the floor, scooping handfuls of rice into the trash, bickering and bantering the whole way, and by the time the emergency takeout they ordered arrives, Megumi\u2019s forgotten about it entirely.\n+\n It takes a good few rounds but Megumi finally takes his victory, throwing out rock and demolishing both Nobara and Yuuji in one fell swoop with their matching scissors. He doesn\u2019t whoop or cheer like Yuuji does, nor does he incessantly gloat the way Nobara would, but he can\u2019t help but turn his chin up and smirk when they collapse back onto the couch with groans.\n \u201cYeah, yeah, you won, fair and square.\u201d Nobara grumbles, rolling onto her side, still completely wrapped up in her giant, fuzzy, purple blanket. \u201cBut I\u2019m telling you, if you pick another documentary on the opioid crisis in America I will shit in your bed.\u201d\n \u201cPlease don\u2019t shit in my bed.\"\n \u201cHow many documentaries on the American opioid crisis do you think are out there?\u201d Yuuji fires back from his place on the floor, looking up at her and frowning.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s gonna watch all of them!\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s very concerning that you haven\u2019t promised not to shit in my bed yet.\u201d Megumi sighs, nudging Nobara off the couch with his foot in small increments until she inevitably hits the floor with a yelp. \u201cYou\u2019re on popcorn duty this week, go get it.\u201d\n \u201cGet me a coke while you\u2019re there!\u201d Yuuji shuffles up onto the couch next to Megumi, kicking his legs onto Megumi\u2019s lap. Megumi pushes them off. Yuuji kicks them back up, pulling out his phone and ignoring Megumi\u2019s attempts to push his legs off again.\n Nobara scoffs, struggling to her feet. Her blanket burrito doesn\u2019t slip. Megumi\u2019s almost impressed. \u201cUgh. Fine. Megumi?\u201d\n He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d\n \u201cGet him a soda too, he\u2019ll start stealing mine eventually.\u201d Yuuji adds, not looking up from his phone, yelping when Megumi smacks his leg. \u201cWhat, you always do!\u201d\n \u201cI did it once cause I was choking on popcorn and I didn\u2019t wanna die.\u201d\n \u201cWhat about last movie night, huh?\u201d\n \u201cI was high, you can\u2019t hold that against me.\u201d\n \u201cShut the fuck up!\u201d Nobara shouts from the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you both soda, just stop fucking shouting!\u201d\n Yuuji winces, flashing a guilty glance Megumi\u2019s way. \u201cJeez.\u201d He mutters. \u201cWhat\u2019s got her so pissy?\u201d\n \u201cShitty group project. She pulled an all-nighter over it.\u201d Megumi makes sure to keep his voice low, leaning into Yuuji\u2019s side for the other boy to hear. Yuuji jerks back, eyes wide, turning his concerned gaze towards the kitchen. \u201cAlmost cried over breakfast too.\u201d\n \u201cDid I miss it?\u201d Yuuji\u2019s leg starts to bounce, his forehead twisted with worry.\n \u201cYou were on your run.\u201d Megumi says. Yuuji only hums in response, still staring at the kitchen. He rolls his eyes, reaching over, flicking him in the forehead. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine, she just needs a break tonight and she\u2019ll be good. I\u2019ll pick one of her dumb action movies, okay?\u201d\n Yuuji blinks, tilting his head, still rubbing the spot Megumi flicked. \u201cWeren\u2019t you really excited to watch that penguin documentary that just came out?\u201d He gestures to the TV. He\u2019s already pulled it up, selected the Japanese subtitles and the English audio, started and paused it so the trailer wouldn\u2019t be looping forever in the way that Megumi hates.\n Megumi\u2019s heart stutters in his chest. \u201cYou remembered that?\u201d He says, feeling oddly touched. He only mentioned it off-handedly, in passing conversation, months ago when they were still awkward and unfamiliar.\n Yuuji looks at him like he\u2019s stupid. \u201cOf course I did.\u201d He says matter of fact. Megumi\u2019s heart stumbles in his chest again. Yuuji smiles, the smallest thing, fond and warm and honey-sweet.\n \u201cHere.\u201d Nobara\u2019s voice cuts through the air, as abrupt and unceremonious as the cans she dumps in their laps. Megumi winces, watching one smack right into Yuuji\u2019s shin, quickly reaching out to stop it from falling as Yuuji clutches his leg and yells.\n \u201cWhat the hell Nobara!\u201d He cries, pained scowl disappearing as soon as he turns it on her. Curious, Megumi follows his gaze, seeing her curled up in the armchair, face glowing from the light of her phone. She taps at it, stares, and then huffs out the tiniest of giggles. He doesn\u2019t need to turn back to know what kind of face Yuuji\u2019s making. \u201cHey Nobara, who ya\u2019 textin\u2019?\u201d\n She fumbles her phone, face bright red, eyes wide and panicked. \u201cNo one! Fuck off!\u201d She blurts almost reflexively.\n \u201cWe both literally helped you get ready for your date with Maki last week.\u201d Megumi replies. Yuuji snickers. Nobara only grows redder.\n \u201cAnd? So what, you a cop or something?\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cAh, young love.\u201d Yuuji sighs, swooning forwards, somehow, draping himself over Megumi\u2019s back and mushing his cheek against Megumi\u2019s face. \u201cIsn\u2019t it so sweet?\u201d\n Nobara blinks, confused, before understanding dawns on her face, swiftly followed by anger. \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare\u2014\u201c\n \u201cI remember when I first fell for your father.\u201d Yuuji grabs Megumi cheeks in a crushing one handed grip, smushing his face and smothering Megumi\u2019s protests. \u201cOur eyes met from across the room, don\u2019t you remember darling?\u201d\n Megumi feels the acute sensation of being struck by lightning. \u201cBuh?\u201d He replies intelligently, still being squished into oblivion.\n \u201cDie.\u201d Nobara seethes. Her hand drifts threateningly to the full bowl of popcorn by her side. Megumi manages to wrestle Yuuji off and grab the remote and start the movie just in time, saving the sofa and his sanity in one swift move.\n+\n Megumi stumbles through the door, half-asleep and half-dead, yawning through his greeting and shuffling into the kitchen. Nobara looks up from her notes, pausing at the sight of him.\n \u201cWoah, you look dead.\u201d She says, giving a disbelieving once over. \u201cDid you sleep at all?\u201d\n \u201cA lil.\u201d Megumi mumbles. He dumps his bags on the couch, rubbing his eyes. \u201cOne of the dogs was scared, she needed someone to sit with her.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you sat with her all night? In her kennel?\u201d Nobara laughs, shaking her head. \u201cGod, you\u2019re something else Fushiguro.\u201d\n \u201cShe was crying!\u201d Megumi protests, all bite lost in the exhaustion of his voice. He blinks, looking around unsteadily. \u201cYuuji left for his practice?\u201d\n \u201cYeah. He left before I woke up.\u201d Nobara replies, turning back to her homework for barely a moment before she\u2019s turning back again. \u201cWait, how\u2019d you know about that?\u201d \n \u201cHe texted me on my way here.\u201d Megumi holds out his phone, letting her see the screen. \u201cAlso has a message for us.\u201d\n Nobara takes his phone gingerly, tapping on the unopened snapchat with no small amount of apprehension. \u201cOh boy.\u201d She mutters as it loads. Megumi snorts and shuffles behind her to watch.\n It opens on Yuuji, in their apartment, a thin sheen of sweat covering his head and his track shirt sticking to his chest. \u201cSorry I had to leave so early.\u201d He starts in what Megumi has come to know as his shit-starting voice, his very first syllable making Nobara stiffen in place. \u201cMegumi your breakfast is in the fridge, make sure you eat it and get some rest. Nobara, I hope you have a wonderful day at school, hugs and kisses for you both!\u201d\n He blows a big fat wet kiss at the screen. The video closes. Nobara thrusts the phone back at Megumi, disgust filling every inch of her face. \u201cI\u2019m going to go throw up.\u201d She announces with disdain, sliding off the stool and storming off. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m going to shit in Yuuji\u2019s bed.\u201d\n \u201cPlease stop threatening to do that.\u201d Megumi admonishes faintly, his ears hot and his heart pounding. He stumbles over to the fridge like a man possessed, yanking the door open and staring desperately at the contents inside.\n Right there in the centre, a saran-wrapped plate of omurice, ketchup messily drawn in the shape of a smiley-face. There\u2019s a sticky note on top, one of the little teddy-bear ones Nobara keeps forgetting to bring back to her room. Megumi reaches out, peels it off the saran-wrap, bringing it up to his face to read it.\n You worked really hard today!! I\u2019m super proud of you and I\u2019m sure those dogs are too!!! Make sure you get lots of rest dear husband of mine!!!! The kanji is messy and cluttered, barely enough room left for the tiny little dog drawn at the bottom. It\u2019s not a very good dog either. It\u2019s more like a compressed moose, if anything.\n He traces the picture with his thumb. A spike of affection runs through his chest, hot and bright and unmistakable. \u201cOh shit.\u201d Megumi says out loud, getting the very distinct sensation of the start of a major crisis. \u201cOh shit.\u201d\n Atop the omurice, the smiley-face stares at him, almost accusingly. Yeah, it\u2019s unblinking eyes seem to say. it\u2019s about time you noticed you fucking moron. Megumi\u2019s too busy panicking to feel offended.\n+\n So now they\u2019ve got this running bit, the three of them, where they pretend that Yuuji and Megumi are Nobara\u2019s gay dads. Well, it\u2019s more Yuuji\u2019s running bit. Nobara finds it absolutely disgusting and cites it as her inevitable motive for their inevitable murder. Megumi would probably find it funnier if it wasn\u2019t the catalyst for his current romantic crisis.\n The thing about Yuuji Itadori is that he\u2019s got a penchant for running a joke into the ground. He\u2019ll beat it to death, and then just keep fucking beating it until the people forced to put up with him drag him away from the joke\u2019s bleeding and broken frame, begging him to show it a little mercy. It\u2019s annoying, but Megumi\u2019s always found it oddly charming. Now he\u2019s certain it\u2019s going to be his cause of death.\n Nobara comes from home from class and Yuuji asks her if she wants an after-school snack, hand pushed into Megumi\u2019s back pocket. Nobara drops a mug with a curse and Yuuji tells her to watch her language, his fingers running through Megumi\u2019s hair. Nobara mentions how good Maki looked that day and Yuuji rambles about love at first sight, turning to direct his blinding smile at Megumi and calling him honey, sugar, sweetheart, doll, his voice saccharine sweet and his thumb rubbing circles into the back of Megumi\u2019s hand.\n It\u2019s infuriating and frustrating and fucking addictive as all hell. Yuuji had always been a tactile person, had been clinging to Megumi like a leech for months now. The cuddling on the couch and the gentle hand on the small of his back as he squeezed past behind him and their legs intertwined under Megumi\u2019s covers after a particularly bad nightmare, they\u2019ve always been a thing. Hell, Nobara does it just as much as Yuuji does, but for some reasons the back of her palm against Megumi\u2019s head doesn\u2019t make him dissolve into a little mushy puddle of man.\n It\u2019s probably a good thing, he reasons, leaning into the softness of her touch. He already feels mostly liquid, his limbs weak and shaky, barely able to hold himself up. \u201cI mean, your fever finally broke, but man, you\u2019re fucked up.\u201d She says, most likely worrying her lip under her mask.\n \u201cM\u2019fine.\u201d He rasps, trying to push himself upright. He\u2019s sweating through his sheets and it feels gross against his skin but Nobara pushes him right back into it. He whines. \u201cNoooooo\u2014\u201c\n \u201cHe\u2019s still sick!\u201d She shouts over her shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s also being a little bitch!\u201d\n \u201cI wanna shower, I feel disgusting.\u201d He groans, trying to find a not gross spot. \u201cAnd I need to get out of these sheets\u2014\u201c\n \u201cYou\u2019re going to pass out if you get in the shower. Your spindly little twig legs are going to collapse under your own weight and you\u2019re going to crack your head on the tile and get blood everywhere and I\u2019m gonna have to clean it up. Like hell I\u2019m letting you shower.\u201d\n \u201cYou haven\u2019t cleaned a goddamn thing in this house since you moved in and you know it.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s called feminism.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m going to get you evicted.\u201d\n \u201cNobara, it\u2019s eleven.\u201d Yuuji laughs, pushing open the door to Megumi\u2019s room with his shoulder, glass of water in one hand and medicine in the other. He passes them to Megumi, quickly running the back of his hand along Megumi\u2019s forehead. The touch makes Megumi\u2019s heart skip a beat, which is, at this point, predictable and annoying more than it is terrifying, which is nice.\n Nobara curses, loudly. \u201cArgh, this material is important for the final too.\u201d She groans, straightening up, pressing her hands together apologetically at Megumi. \u201cSorry Megumi, I really can\u2019t fail this class\u2026\u201d \n Megumi swallows, waving her off. \u201cI\u2019m not dying.\u201d He grumbles. \u201cJust go, with you gone I\u2019ll be able to shower.\u201d\n \u201cYou little shit\u2014\u201c\n \u201cNobara, if I help Megumi shower would you be okay with that?\u201d Yuuji interjects loudly. The fact that the very concept doesn\u2019t make Megumi immediately freeze in terror is a testament to how gross Megumi feels. He turns his gaze on Nobara, trying his best to beg with his eyes. He\u2019s past the point of dignity. He just wants to be clean.\n Nobara gags. \u201cEw, fine, don\u2019t look at me like that, Jesus.\u201d She shoves at his face, walking backwards out of the room. \u201cI\u2019ll be going in the next five minutes, okay?\u201d\n \u201cStay safe!\u201d Yuuji shouts back. He turns to Megumi, eyes sparkling with a smile that\u2019s hidden behind his mask. \u201cReady?\u201d\n \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d Megumi grumbles, wincing as Yuuji helps him to his feet. \u201cSorry you were stuck taking care of me this past week.\u201d\n \u201cNah, it\u2019s fine. You\u2019re low maintenance and I got my flu shot so it was really no problem.\u201d Yuuji is less supporting his weight and more so carrying him, guiding him through the hall and into the bathroom. Megumi would be more embarrassed if he wasn\u2019t so grateful. \u201cYou better remember to get your shot next season.\u201d\n \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Megumi sighs, collapsing on top of the toilet seat when Yuuji lets him down. He groans, the cool tile beneath his bare feet a blessing. \u201cI can get into the tub just fine.\u201d\n Yuuji nods. \u201cKay. Strip and get in and turn on the shower if you can. I\u2019ll grab you some clothes.\u201d Megumi hums his reply, already peeling off his shirt. He strips down, clambering into the tub on unsteady feet, barely able to reach the knobs in time. He manages, somehow, getting the water warm before he\u2019s forced to lean against the wall, blinking spots from his vision. He groans, dropping his head to his chin, closing his eyes.\n \u201cMegumi?\u201d Yuuji calls. Megumi grunts. \u201cYou dead?\u201d Megumi grunts again. Yuuji\u2019s laugh is soft but still bright, echoing off the tile in time with the sound of the water hitting the floor. His hand braces the back of Megumi\u2019s neck, helping him shift up so he\u2019s haphazardly braced against the tile.\u201cYou want me to help?\u201d\n Megumi shakes his head. \u201cJust be here in case I die.\u201d He rasps out.\n \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll hose down the blood before it has the chance to dry.\u201d Yuuji replies, voice dancing with humour. Megumi can\u2019t help but laugh, tilting his face up into the shower\u2019s hot spray. He blindly grabs for the soap, lathering himself quickly and sloppily. He already feels better with just the shower\u2019s hot spray alone, but he still tries to get behind his ears and scrub at his skin.\n Outside the shower, silhouette visible through the sheer of the curtain, Yuuji sits on the counter. His form is too blurry to make out specifics, but Megumi can tell that he\u2019s got one foot tucked underneath him, scrolling through his phone with one hand, idly drumming against his leg with the other.\n \u201cFeet off the counter.\u201d He chides, hoarse but gentle. He watches the shadowy mass shift in posture.\n \u201cSorry.\u201d Yuuji calls back, not sounding particularly sorry at all. Megumi hums in reply. \u201cWant me to wash your hair?\u201d \n Megumi blinks, considering. \u201cAre you gonna get shampoo in my eye?\u201d\n \u201cHey!\u201d Yuuji scoffs. His shadow hops off the counter. \u201cI\u2019m pretty careful, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n \u201cMy apologies.\u201d Megumi\u2019s words are dry, but he can\u2019t stop his voice from softening as says, \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d\n Yuuji doesn\u2019t reply, simply pulling open the shower curtain and stepping into the shower. His shirt is gone but he\u2019s still wearing his basketball shorts. He catches sight of Megumi\u2019s raised eyebrow, blushing, saying, \u201cWhat, I didn\u2019t want to make it weird!\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ve been to public baths before.\u201d Megumi pointedly replies, letting Yuuji guide him to the floor, hearing the scraping of the stool behind them. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen each other naked. Hell, we\u2019ve seen Nobara naked.\"\n \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d Yuuji grumbles. Megumi glances back, laughing when he sees Yuuji\u2019s blush grow darker. He pushes Megumi\u2019s head back. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d\n Megumi obliges. Yuuji\u2019s fingers press into his scalp, massaging in small circles, lathering his hair in shampoo. He sighs, leaning into the touch. \u201cDid you catch Nobara before she left?\u201d\n \u201cYeah, why?\u201d\n \u201cNo reason, just wondering.\u201d Megumi lets Yuuji\u2019s gentle fingers guide him, tilting his head to the side. \u201cFelt bad, I know she cancelled on Maki to take care of me that one night you had class.\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t believe you remember that.\u201d Yuuji laughs, breathy and disbelieving. \u201cYou were fucking gone for like two days straight.\u201d\n \u201cI remember bits and pieces.\u201d\n \u201cYeah?\u201d\n \u201cMm.\u201d\n \u201cLike what?\u201d Yuuji\u2019s hands card through Megumi\u2019s hair, rinsing out the suds.\n \u201cThat dumb fucking song you had on repeat.\u201d Megumi replies dryly. He feels Yuuji shake with laughter behind him. \u201cYou played it for like a full day straight, at some point I was going to be conscious enough to be aware of it!\u201d\n \u201cOkay, okay, I get it I have bad taste in music\u2014\u201c\n \u201cYour taste in music is fine, it\u2019s just, why do you play it on loop don\u2019t you have anything else\u2014\u201c\n \u201cIt\u2019s catchy!\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s insufferable!\u201d Megumi snaps, smile pulling at the corners of his mouth. Yuuji\u2019s hands have stopped moving, instead braced against his shoulders as he doubles over and laughs and laughs and laughs. Megumi throws back an elbow. \u201cHey, hurry up, we\u2019re gonna prune over completely if we\u2019re here any longer.\u201d\n \u201cSorry, sorry!\u201d Yuuji\u2019s hands resume their motions. He\u2019s using conditioner now. Megumi tries to ignore the shivers that run down his spine in response. \u201cAnything else?\u201d\n \u201cHuh?\u201d\n \u201cAnything else you remember?\u201d\n \u201cOh, that soup you made.\u201d\n \u201cThe vegetable one?\u201d\n \u201cYeah, it was nice.\u201d\n \u201cDo you wanna have it for dinner tonight?\u201d\n \u201cSure.\u201d Megumi sighs. Yuuji starts rinsing out the last of the conditioner, soft snickers echoing into the air. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny now?\u201d\n \u201cSorry, just\u2014\u201c Yuuji starts, and then stops, dissolving into laughter again. \u201cI just kept waiting for Nobara to cut us off by calling us gross or whatever, I forgot she wasn\u2019t here.\u201d\n \u201cBe kinda weird if she was. The three of us, in the bath together?\u201d\n Yuuji flick his neck. \u201cNot like that.\u201d He huffs. His voice is tight, weirdly so, strangled in a way Yuuji hardly ever seems to be. \u201cJust\u2026\u201d He trails off.\n \u201cJust what?\u201d He prompts gently. Yuuji stays silent, standing up, turning the shower off, helping Megumi to his feet. He hands over a towel, not meeting Megumi\u2019s eyes. Megumi frowns, but takes it without a word. They continue in silence, drying off, changing clothes \u2014 Yuuji luckily having the foresight to bring himself another set so he\u2019s not tracking water all over the house. He helps Megumi with his, guiding him into his pants and helping the shirt over his head. It\u2019d be embarrassing if it were anyone else, but it\u2019s Yuuji, so his touch is gentle and his hands are warm. Megumi lets himself be led out of the bathroom and into the hall and into Yuuji\u2019s bedroom.\n \u201cYou cleaned up.\u201d He says, surprised.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t have to sound so shocked.\u201d Yuuji grumbles. His ears are red. He guides Megumi to his bed, helping him lay down and settling next to him.\n \u201cMask?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t need one.\u201d His words are distant and distracted. Megumi frowns, rolling over with some difficulty, batting away Yuuji\u2019s hands when they move to help him. \u201cMegumi\u2014\u201c\n \u201cJust what, Yuuji.\u201d He asks. His voice is hoarse and rough, scraping its way out of his throat. Yuuji stiffens, then softens, turning towards him. They lie side by side, face to face. Megumi can feel the warmth of Yuuji\u2019s skin against his own.\n \u201cI never realized how much we acted like a married couple even before we started this dumb joke.\u201d He says, soft and sincere, hushed like it\u2019s a confession. In the still silence of the room, they ring loud and clear. \n Megumi blinks at him, stunned. \u201cDid you seriously have to drag it out for that long?\u201d He asks, disbelieving. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t just say it while we were in the bathroom?\u201d\n Yuuji\u2019s cheeks flush pink, pretty and high on his cheeks. \u201cYou were naked!\u201d He snaps defensively. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about me being naked?\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s nothing bad, it just didn\u2019t feel right!\u201d\n \u201cThat literally makes no se\u2014\u201c Megumi starts, and then stops, closing his eyes and bringing his hand up to cup Yuuji\u2019s jaw when he\u2019s interrupted by the feeling of soft lips against his own. It\u2019s warm, so warm, like the smell of breakfast in the morning, like the feeling of legs stacked on top of his own, like the feeling of stepping through the front door and kicking off his shoes and calling out a greeting and being met with the sound of home.\n Yuuji pulls away. The pink has spread to the tips of his ears. \u201cHey.\u201d He says, softly, giggling as he does.\n \u201cYou better not get sick after this.\u201d Megumi warns him. He runs his thumb along the edge of Yuuji\u2019s jaw.\n \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d\n \u201cI got my flu shot, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n \u201cIf you get sick I\u2019m not taking care of you.\u201d\n \u201cHow mean Megumi! To be so cruel to your own husband\u2014\u201c\n \u201cCan you at least take me out to dinner before you start that up again?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll make you that soup and we can watch National Geographic on your laptop?\u201d\n \u201c\u2026fine.\u201d Megumi sighs. Yuuji beams and leans in to kiss him again.\n+\n Yuuji comes into the living room just as Megumi\u2019s done with the socks, putting the last of them in their pile in the corner of the armchair. He grabs Megumi\u2019s wrist, pulling him close to his chest, pressing a kiss to Megumi\u2019s cheek, the highest he can reach. Megumi scoffs, pushing at his chest. \u201cLet me finish the laundry first.\u201d He protests, trying to wriggle out of his arms. \u201cNobara\u2019s bringing Maki over apparently.\u201d\n \u201cYou grew up with Maki, you don\u2019t have to make a good impression.\u201d Yuuji laughs. He starts to sway to the song playing from the radio, an old ballad from the classics station. \u201cOh, I love this song!\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re such an old man.\u201d Megumi rolls his eyes, but sways with him, bringing his hands up to rest on Yuuji\u2019s hips.\n \u201cMy grandpa hated this song.\u201d Yuuji confesses. \u201cHe said it was overplayed in his youth, so I used to piss him off by blaring it through the house.\u201d\n \u201cWhat a loving grandchild you were.\u201d Megumi replies dryly. Yuuji\u2019s laughter rattles through his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re helping me with the laundry when the song\u2019s over.\u201d\n \u201cKay.\u201d Yuuji replies. Megumi can feel his eyes close, long eyelashes brushing against his collarbones. The room glows gold in the sunset that filters through the blinds, pinks and purples painted across Yuuji\u2019s skin. The song is slow and sweet, like a well-worn memory fondly held in familiar hands. Megumi feels the warmth of Yuuji\u2019s breath ghost along his skin, and hopes that they are no different.\n \u201cOh my god.\u201d Megumi lifts his head, meeting Nobara\u2019s open look of disgust and horror, like she isn\u2019t holding her girlfriend\u2019s hand in her own. \u201cMaki-san, I\u2019m so sorry, I told you they\u2019re the worst.\u201d\n \u201cI can see what you mean.\u201d Maki replies drily, mouth pressed into a thin line, corners barely twitching with bemusement. There\u2019s the pink shimmer of lip gloss smudged against the corner of her mouth. Megumi pointedly does not mention it, nor the oversized leather jacket draped over Nobara\u2019s shoulders.\n Yuuji lifts his head. \u201cHey Nobara!\u201d He says brightly, voice full of mirth and mischief. Megumi hides his own smile in the tufts of his hair. \u201cHow was your date?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m leaving!\u201d Nobara announces pointedly, dragging Maki behind her as she escapes to her room.\n \u201cMake sure you leave the door open.\u201d Megumi calls after them calmly, and Yuuji tilts his head back and laughs, voice as rich as the setting sun. It rings through the air, and Megumi chases it with a kiss, committing it to memory, alongside all the other things that he can call home."
