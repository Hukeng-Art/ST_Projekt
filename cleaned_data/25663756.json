Please comment and let me know!</p>\n<p>Hi everyone! Thank you so much for the great responses to the first two chapters!<br>UPDATE: I need help! I'm writing a new fic and I can't decide what pairings to use! I literally love all ships in Merlins I don't have a preference as to what I write since romance won't be the most important thing. It's kind of a Lancelot based fix-it fic so keep that in mind.<br>Please comment what number you would prefer!<br>1. Arthur/Gwen and Merlin/Lancelot<br>2. Arthur/Merlin and Lancelot/Gwen<br>3. Arthur/Gwen and Merlin/Gwaine</p>\n<p>Hey everyone! Thank you so much for the love. :) I'm gonna update every couple days now I've just been really busy watching hockey because playoffs started. I've also decided on a Lancelot/Merlin pairing for my next fic now I think because I believe the fandom is sorely lacking in that area on this site. Hope you love this chapter! :)</p>\n<p>Hey everyone! Another short chapter, sorry, but the next ones are the long ones. :) I couldn't remember if Lancelot ever mentioned what happened to his family in the show, so I came up with this extremely sad story. If he did mention his family and I forgot it, well then I suppose we're just having a lil OOC backstory.</p>\n<p>Only 2 more left! The response to this has been absolutely insane so thank you everyone!</p>\n<p>One left!</p>\n<p>And this story is done! I really hope you all like the ending! I don't love the reveal but I didn't want to get into a long-winded reveal scene so this is what I came up with.</p>",
    "text": "\u00a0\nArthur never listened to Merlin. Even though he should. This was a well-known and well-understood fact amongst the Knights of the Round Table, who had seen firsthand how Merlin always seemed to sense danger before the rest of them, and how Arthur resolutely ignored him until said danger reared its head and inevitably got one, or all of them, injured or kidnapped.\n\u00a0\nNow, chained to a wall in the large dungeon of an abandoned castle, the Knights were once again wishing their King had listened to his manservant.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you think he wants with us?\u201d asked Elyan, trying to piece together what the sorcerer who captured them may be seeking.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRevenge\u201d mumbled Merlin under his breath, knowing that practically all sorcerers were the same, and they always sought revenge for the wrongdoings of Uther during the Great Purge.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat was that Merlin?\u201d The King asked, glaring at his frie- servant.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing sire!\u201d Merlin replied with a false grin and the intonation of someone who most definitely did not utter the title with respect.\n\u00a0\nGwaine snorted. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have to be asking that question if the Princess listened to Merlin for once.\u201d Arthur scowled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGwaine\u2026\u201d Leon warned.\n\u00a0\nThe long-haired knight simply cocked his head to the side. \u201cWhat? You all know I\u2019m right. Merlin always knows when something bad is going to happen and yet we never seem to heed his warnings. Now here we are probably about to be killed by some sorcerer.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to kill us Gwaine.\u201d Merlin said with an amount of confidence that Arthur thought he probably shouldn\u2019t have. Their swords and daggers had been taken, they had no idea where they were, and they were chained to a wall. Arthur failed to see where the hope that his manservant had was coming from.\n\u00a0\nLancelot, from his place in the corner, looked up and locked eyes with Merlin, silently asking \u2018you have a plan?\u2019 with his eyes. Merlin simply nodded.\n\u00a0\nAs soon as Arthur opened his mouth to ask Merlin what exactly made him so sure, they heard footsteps and all fell silent.\n\u00a0\nA middle-aged man wearing a cloak appeared in the dungeon with a worrying grin on his face. \u201cAh! Arthur Pendragon. You\u2019re awake.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you want with us\u201d the King spat out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want you to feel immeasurable pain Your Highness.\u201d The Knights paled. The sorcerer continued. \u201cYour father caused more suffering than you could possibly understand, and it is my duty to ensure another Pendragon can never harm an innocent magic user again. I want you to experience the horrors your lineage has enacted.\u201d Merlin scoffed from his place on the wall. The Knights and Arthur turned to tell him to shut up, but he spoke before they could.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, yes, you wish to enact revenge on Arthur for the sins of his father. We\u2019ve heard it all before. Could you please tell us what you plan to do and spare us the monologue. As I\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve heard it before.\u201d The sorcerer looked almost\u2026impressed? While all the Knights except Lancelot and Gwaine worked to pick their jaws up off the floor. Gwaine was impressed too. He smiled at Merlin. Lancelot simply grinned fondly and shook his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMerlin!\u201d Arthur yelled. \u201cShut up please before you get us all killed.\u201d Merlin rolled his eyes.\n\u00a0\nThe sorcerer spoke up once more. \u201cNo Your Highness, your servant is quite right. There is no need to prolong the inevitable. I have here in my hand a vial of liquid, that will allow the consumer to feel the worst pain known to each in this room. You, Arthur Pendragon, will drink this, and will experience the pain of the worst wound that has been received by each who sit here today, while the memory of the wound is shown in your mind. It will look and feel like you are the one experiencing the pain, while the rest of us get to watch the memory, and enjoy your reaction.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAt this, Merlin stilled. He didn\u2019t know about the others, but he knew he couldn\u2019t let Arthur experience the pain of a Serket sting; he wasn\u2019t sure that Arthur could handle it. The other Knights looked at their King worryingly, while Arthur stared straight in the face of the sorcerer, head held high.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo be it.\u201d Arthur said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait!\u201d Leon yelled. Arthur turned his head to look questioningly at his knights. \u201cCan one of us volunteer to go in his place?\u201d Arthur was shaking his head before Leon even got the question out, but all the Knights steeled themselves as if they were getting ready to volunteer.\n\u00a0\nThe sorcerer mulled the question over for a second. \u201cThere is only one here who I will allow to replace the King. You know which one of you you are.\u201d The Knights looked confused at the second half of his answer, but nonetheless they all shakily rose from their place at the wall. Merlin knew the sorcerer meant him, could feel it, although he didn\u2019t know how. So he too stepped up and walked as far forward as the chains allowed him to. The sorcerer appraised him and nodded, much to Arthur and the Knight\u2019s confusion, all except Lancelot, and moved forward to unchain him from the wall and move Merlin into the center of the dungeon.\n\u00a0\nHe could vaguely hear the Knights yelling at him to stop, but he blocked out the sound in favour of listening to his heartbeat. The only sound he heard clearly was Arthur yelling. \u201cMerlin! Stop! You can\u2019t do this!\u201d Arthur turned to the sorcerer. \u201cPut him back. I will endure the spell. He\u2019s no warrior! He cannot handle these wounds!\u201d Arthur struggled more and more, trying to rid himself of the chains so he could get to Merlin, but nothing was working.\n\u00a0\nThe sorcerer looked at the King, then back at Merlin, and chuckled. He turned to Arthur. \u201cHe may not be a Knight, Your Highness, but I can assure you this servant of yours is a warrior.\u201d All but Lancelot looked puzzled. \u201cHe is much more than your servant.\u201d Merlin looked at the man, and tried to speak to him in his mind.\n\u00a0\n\n\u2018Please do not tell them who I am.\u2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe sorcerer chuckled again. Do not worry Emrys. I am sure once all of this is over, they will know all. Merlin sucked in a breath at that, but readied himself for the pain he was about to endure.\n\u00a0\nThe sorcerer uttered a spell that Merlin was sure meant he was tying all their minds together, allowing to draw on the memories of the moments they endured the most pain, and allowing them to see each other\u2019s memories once the time came.\n\u00a0\nBefore the sorcerer forced Merlin to drink from the vial, he looked at each Knight, all with various expressions of horror showing on their faces. He landed on Lancelot, who looked at him with a quiet and sad acceptance, and he mouthed \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 at his friend. He finally finished on Arthur, who was still struggling and yelling to let Merlin go, that he would endure the pain. Merlin met Arthur\u2019s eyes and whispered a few words. \u201cIt\u2019s okay Arthur. I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve got a high pain tolerance.\u201d He smiled weakly. \u201cJust\u2026promise me that whatever you see, you\u2019ll give me a chance to explain.\u201d Arthur looked confused, but upon seeing the earnest look on his friends\u2019 face, he nodded.\n\u00a0\nThe sorcerer smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s begin.\u201d\nMerlin had no idea what was going on, or where he was. He remembered drinking the potion the sorcerer intended for Arthur, but he was no longer in the dungeon. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he could hear people screaming for him, he recognized some voices; Lancelot and Gwaine, and Arthur. \u2018Ah,\u2019 he thought. \u2018I\u2019m in the first memory.\u2019\nHe heard the sorcerer\u2019s voice speak loud and clear: \u201cThis is the worst wound inflicted on Sir Elyan. Enjoy.\u201d At that, Merlin looked up and noticed he was in Gwen\u2019s father\u2019s forge. Merlin didn\u2019t know how he knew, but he felt like he was quite young. He had no control of the body, he simply experienced walking around and touching things, before he heard a commotion and spun around to see an angry looking man walking into the forge. Before he knew or understood what was happening, the man grabbed a burning hot steel rod and branded Elyan\u2019s (Merlin\u2019s) arm, burning through layers of skin.\nMerlin hissed, but he didn\u2019t scream. The pain was nowhere near as bad as what he had endured himself. The scene lasted for as long as the pain was fresh. Merlin didn\u2019t know how long he stood there, just waiting for it to subside. Once the pain was gone, Merlin opened his eyes to discover himself back in the dungeon, with the Knights and Arthur looking at him in horror. Elyan\u2019s jaw was slack. They had clearly seen his non-reaction. He barely even looked fazed. Merlin turned back to the sorcerer.\n\u201cThe next one?\u201d\nElyan spoke to Merlin: \u201care you alright?\u201d\nMerlin looked confused. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d\nElyan\u2019s jaw dropped even more. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced pain like that in my life, and I\u2019ve been stabbed before. You didn\u2019t even react! How?\u201d\nMerlin looked sheepish. \u201cUhhhh\u2026like I said? High pain tolerance?\"\nArthur looked at his friend as if he didn\u2019t know him. He shook out of it and looked at Elyan. \u201cHe must be in shock. That\u2019s good, maybe it means he won\u2019t really experience the pain.\u201d\nThe sorcerer smiled. \u201cOh no Your Highness, I can assure you that Merlin here felt the pain. It simply seems as if he has endured much worse.\u201d Merlin glared at the man. Arthur felt his throat tighten. Worse? That burn looked horrific, and Merlin didn\u2019t even flinch. It hurt him to think of Merlin in any pain, let alone enough to barely feel a wound that was one of his best knight\u2019s most painful experiences.\nMerlin looked down at his arm, where Elyan had been burned. \u201cThere\u2019s no scar.\u201d He phrased it as a statement, but the sorcerer heard the underlying question anyway.\n\u201cYou will not have physical evidence of the wounds. I simply seek to ensure you feel the pain.\u201d A sadistic smile appeared on the sorcerer\u2019s face and it caused Gwaine to tug on the chains.\n\u201cIf you hurt him, I will rip you limb from limb\u201d the Knight growled out.\n\u201cWhy Sir Gwaine, it is not me who is hurting him. It is all of you.\u201d At that, all the Knights dropped their gazes, feeling guilty for something that was not their faults.\n\u201cGwaine.\u201d Merlin said. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really.\u201d He turned back to the sorcerer. \u201cLet\u2019s just get this over with\u201d.\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Emrys. He added on in his mind. Merlin scowled. \u201cLet us now enjoy the pain of Sir Percival\u2019s worst wound.\u201d\nAfter feeling Percival\u2019s severe stab wound to the abdomen, Merlin writhed, and his breaths came deeper, like he was willing himself to work through it. Percival looked as pale as ghost, clearly not wanting to relive the memory of his battle, but also not wanting his friend to endure the intense pain he felt. As Merlin was lost in the vision, breathing deeply, the Knights and Arthur all turned to look at each other.\n\u201cHow is he not screaming? I was in pain for hours from that wound.\u201d Percival said.\nArthur looked deeply troubled. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be able to endure this much pain like this. He never even gets hurt, all of this must be new to him.\u201d It hurt the King to think of Merlin experiencing all this, and he was terrified of how he would react when he felt Arthur\u2019s worst pain; the Questing Beast.\nLancelot spoke up. \u201cMerlin has endured more than you know, sire. He is strong. If anyone can get through this, it\u2019s him.\u201d The knight turned to look at his friend, and couldn\u2019t help but marvel at how brave he really was.\nArthur was confused. \u201cWhat do you mean Lancelot? When has he been injured before? Something in his childhood?\u201d It was the only thing that made sense. If Merlin had been injured really badly in Camelot, he would\u2019ve known.\nLancelot only shook his head. \u201cNo, sire. He has endured pain in Camelot. Although I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see that when we reach his memory.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what it is?\u201d Gwaine asked.\n\u201cI have my suspicions. I want to be wrong, but being wrong means it\u2019s even greater than what I believe it is, and I do not want Merlin to endure that.\u201d\n\u201cStop speaking in riddles Sir Lancelot. Tell us\u201d Arthur commanded.\n\u201cI cannot, sire. You will see for yourself. I only hope you follow through on your word and give him a chance to explain himself.\u201d Lancelot was terrified for his friend. If it was indeed the Serket sting like he thought it was, he didn\u2019t want Merlin to experience that pain. Merlin was the only person he had ever heard of who had even survived such a sting, and most say the pain is the worst known to man, sent to burn your body from within. He would not be able to bear his friend going through that again, but he knew he had no choice.\nArthur was getting angrier. He was terrified for Merlin, both at the fact that he had been burned and stabbed and had little reaction, and at the fact that he would have to endure what Arthur was sure was as close to near-death as one can be, and the pain that came along with it. He was also angry at Merlin for taking his place. He\u2019s the King, he should be the one to protect his knights and his servant, but Merlin, the idiot he was, thought he could handle it.\nArthur then remembered something the sorcerer said. \u201cWhy did he allow Merlin to be the one to take the potion over me and none of you?\u201d The Knights pondered for a second, while Lancelot shifted uncomfortably.\n\u201cMaybe because he\u2019s not a knight?\u201d Lancelot suggested, making sure there was no suspicion as to the real reason.\nGwaine snorted. \u201cOh please. That\u2019s not it. Merlin\u2019s more a knight than any of us.\u201d\nElyan and Percival nodded, Leon looked confused, and Arthur scowled. \u201cThen tell us Sir Gwaine, why do you believe he picked Merlin?\u201d Arthur ground out.\n\u201cBecause he knew it would hurt you more to see Merlin in pain than it would have hurt if you endured the pain yourself.\u201d Gwaine said matter-of-factly.\nThe other Knights each had their moments of realization at his words, and then agreed. Lancelot agreed with it so much that he thought maybe his reasoning was wrong, and that was in fact why Merlin was up there, not because he was Emrys.\nArthur spluttered, and then sighed. \u201cYes, I suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d\nGwaine looked shocked. \u201cSo you actually admit it?\u201d\n\u201cAdmit what?\u201d\n\u201cYou care about him.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do! He\u2019s my friend.\u201d\nGwaine scoffed again. \u201cWouldn\u2019t hurt you to admit that to his face Princess. Sometimes I wonder if he knows you see him as more than a servant.\u201d\nIt was Arthur\u2019s turn to scoff. \u201cOf course he knows.\u201d But Arthur went silent after that. Did Merlin really not know what he meant to Arthur? He supposed he never outright said it to Merlin\u2019s face, but he always thought that it was clear between the two of them. The banter and joking relationship was surely enough for Merlin to know that Arthur saw him as a friend before he saw him as a servant. Right?\nGwaine noticed the existential crisis he put the King in. \u201cCalm down Princess. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s all okay. Besides, once Merlin gets out of this you can tell him everything and make sure it\u2019s all out in the open.\u201d\nArthur nodded. He would make sure that Merlin knew how much he meant to him.\nUpon the end of the conversation, they heard Merlin hiss again, and they turned their heads back to him. It appeared that his vision would be coming to an end soon.\nMerlin opened his eyes and felt where the stab wound was. Nothing.\nThe sorcerer spoke. \u201cI am impressed. Once again, very little reaction to what I\u2019m sure was a very painful injury.\u201d\nMerlin scowled. \u201cCan we please just keep going? I want to finish this.\u201d\n\u201cOh but what\u2019s the rush? I am having so much fun watching your King flounder.\u201d\nAt that. Merlin turned to look at Arthur, who he had never seen look so murderous. \u201cArthur\u201d the King turned to look at Merlin. \u201cI\u2019m fine. It wasn\u2019t that bad, really.\u201d He heard Percival scoff quietly. \u2018not that bad, he says\u2019 the large knight muttered to himself. \u201cReally Arthur, I can do this. How bad can the rest of you be?\u201d he smiled, and it was forced, but it made Arthur feel better.\n\u201cNext we will see Sir Gwaine.\u201d\n\u201cWait!\u201d Gwaine yelled. \u201cJust let me explain what it is before it happens. Please\u201d he pleaded.\nThe sorcerer nodded.\nGwaine looked at Merlin. \u201cYou know what I was like before I came to Camelot. Better than anyone here.\u201d Merlin smiled at Gwaine and nodded. \u201cYou know what my childhood was like.\u201d With a pointed look, Merlin understood this was about Gwaine\u2019s nobility. He nodded again. \u201cOkay, so given what I\u2019ve told you about my family history, and what you already know, this was near the beginning. Before I had fully left that life. I wasn\u2019t treated well by those around me. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ll have to feel this.\u201d He then turned to look at his fellow knights. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019ll all have to see it.\u201d With one sharp nod at Merlin, he turned his eyes to the sorcerer, who began the vision.\nMerlin found himself being beaten senseless by knights that he recognized were wearing Carleon\u2019s crest. Every punch, every kick to the stomach sent another ripple of pain through him. This one really did hurt. The assault just kept coming, Merlin kept grunting, and Gwaine was painfully reliving one of the worst moments of his life. Being a child of a dead knight under a callous king did not exactly afford him many positive moments, hence being beaten to a pulp at the ripe age of seven.\nThe other Knights looked on as they simultaneously saw Merlin in the dungeon, being thrown around by the invisible force of the assault, and saw a very young Gwaine be beaten by knights who were supposedly bound to protect.\n\n\u201cThink you\u2019re special, boy?\u201d a Carleon knight spat out. \u201cThink just because your father was a knight that you get some special treatment? You\u2019re nothing. You will never be anything more than a peasant, a waste of space, now that he\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nArthur looked at Gwaine. \u201cYou\u2019re a noble?\u201d\nGwaine grimaced. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in nobility by birth.\u201d\nArthur nodded, and his eyes kept glancing back at Merlin as he watched his friend seethe in pain. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were a noble though? You wouldn\u2019t have been banished all those years ago.\u201d\nGwaine looked at Merlin as he replied. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe in any nobles, and I didn\u2019t believe in serving them. I only came back to help you because Merlin asked me to. I only became a knight because Merlin believed in you. It took a lot longer for me to come to want to serve you.\u201d\nArthur looked at Merlin again, ready to reply, before Lancelot spoke. \u201cMerlin has a way of inspiring loyalty, sire. I would not be here if it weren\u2019t for him.\u201d Gwaine nodded his assent.\nArthur couldn\u2019t help but look at Merlin in a new light. Some of his best knights, and dare he say closest friends, were only there because of Merlin. It should have worried him, that his knights\u2019 loyalties may be to someone else before him, but instead it gave him a strange sense of pride.\nElyan ended his silence as he tore his eyes away from Merlin to look at Arthur. \u201cHe protected Gwen for a long time. Showed her kindness that she rarely received in Camelot. There\u2019s something about him. I don\u2019t know what it is, but he has this goodness.\u201d\nEventually, Merlin\u2019s pain receded, and he groggily woke up from the vision. He faintly heard Arthur\u2019s voice saying: \u201cyes, he does. He\u2019s a better man than me.\u201d Merlin was confused, but his head was spinning too much to ponder it.\nHe heard Gwaine\u2019s yell before he turned to look at him. \u201cMerlin! Are you alright? I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that.\u201d\nMerlin only smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry YOU had to go through that Gwaine. You didn\u2019t deserve that. And what they said about you. You know they were wrong. You\u2019re much more than that. You\u2019re a good man Gwaine, definitely not a waste of space.\u201d He grinned cheekily.\nGwaine huffed out a laugh, but his eyes glistened slightly. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be the one comforting you.\u201d Merlin gave him a mock glare. \u201cThank you.\u201d Gwaine muttered softly.\n\u201cA great man once told me that nobility is defined by what you do, not who you are. You\u2019ve proven that Gwaine. You all have.\u201d Merlin said, and then turned to look at the others. Gwaine could only gape at his friend, taken aback by the expression of sheer belief on his face. The Knights looked on in amazement, wondering how on earth they were in the presence of someone so good.\nMerlin looked back to the sorcerer. \u201cOnly 4 of us left now, yes? Can we keep moving?\u2019 The sorcerer simply chuckled, no longer in disbelief, but in begrudging respect.\n\nI\u2019m surprised iron chains work on you, Emrys. Maybe your power is not as great as the prophecies say.\n\nMerlin scowled, and replied in his head. Everyone has limits. Although I have no qualms testing mine if you keep stopping.\nThe Knights looked confused at the seeming staring contest going on between the two, whereas Lancelot shifted nervously, thinking of a way to explain what they were watching. Fortunately for him, it wasn\u2019t necessary as the sorcerer simply sighed and said: \u201cSir Lancelot. The bravest and most noble of them all\u201d Leon narrowed his eyes at that, but accepted it, \u201cLet us enjoy your pain.\u201d\nLancelot looked at his friend, and with obvious emotion in his eyes, said: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Merlin.\u201d\nMerlin grinned at Lancelot, but the knight knew him well enough to know it was fake. \u201cYou know me my friend, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\nMerlin was not fine. He was screaming in agony and fear for a long time, long enough for Gwaine to empty his already empty stomach on the dungeon floor, planning a hundred ways to painfully murder the sorcerer doing this to his friend.\nPercival and Elyan couldn\u2019t watch. Leon was looking at the ground, looking more disturbed than anyone had ever seen him. His mask of the perfectly detached knight lost about 20 minutes ago. Lancelot had silent tears travelling down his cheeks, less from seeing again the massacre in which he lost his family, but from his best friend, nay his brother, having to experience the sensation of burning alive. He knew the feelings that would bring about for Merlin, being the only know who knew of his fear of the pyre.\nThere were few external injuries, but the feeling of smoke filling his lungs was one Lancelot knew Merlin would never forget. The pain was probably bearable,\u00a0 nothing he knew Merlin hadn\u2019t faced before, but what it would do to his mind, that terrified Lancelot.\nArthur was staring at Merlin, unwilling to take his eyes off him, as if watching him would will away some of the pain. No one had ever seen that face on their king before; his expression showed no emotion, and seemingly, neither did his eyes. He looked like he had no soul, and yet his knights could somehow see every emotion running through his mind reflected back at them: terror, anguish, overwhelming anger.\nAfter gods knew how long, Merlin passed out, only for the sorcerer to speak a spell over him, for him to wake up immediately, returning to the pain.\n\u201cNo rest for you\u201d.\nGwaine growled, adding more methods of torture onto his list to inflict on the man.\nEventually, Merlin\u2019s torture faded, and he came out of the vision once Lancelot had escaped the burning hut. There was no natural light in the dungeon, so they had no way of knowing how long they had been there, but it already felt like a lifetime for the knights.\nMerlin\u2019s head rolled to the side, breathing heavily, trying to return to the feeling of his lungs being normal.\nHe looked at Lancelot first, and only barely heard his friend speak to him as the tears ran freely down his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026so so sorry\u2026But you\u2019re safe now. It won\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\u201cLancelot\u2026\u201d Merlin coughed. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019m sorry you had to see it again.\u201d As he said it, he was struggling to get the image out of his head; picturing himself tied to the platform, watching it be set alight.\nMerlin and Percival were the only two who knew of Lancelot\u2019s past, the story of loss too painful to tell. Lancelot simply shook his head and gave Merlin a look that showed just how sorry he was that Merlin had to experience the feeling that had plagued his nightmares since he was a child.\n\u201cArthur.\u201d Merlin said. It seemed to break the king out of the trance he had been in.\n\u201cMerlin?\u201d Arthur looked incredibly disoriented, as if he didn\u2019t know where he was. \u201cMerlin!\u201d he focused. He turned to the sorcerer. \u201cStop this right now! You accomplish nothing by harming him. It is me you want. If you let him and my knights go you are welcome to do with me what you wish.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Merlin yelled, although it came out weak. He was reeling from the experience, and the pain was unlike any he had ever felt; unique in its way of clawing through his lungs and devastating his breathing.\nThe sorcerer laughed again. \u201cI am getting exactly what I want, young king. This is destroying you. Watching him you care about most is bringing you more pain than these wounds ever could.\u201d\nMerlin allowed himself to revel in the fact that he said Arthur cared about him the most before Arthur spoke again.\n\u201cPlease\u201d Arthur begged. The king never begged. This was serious.\nThe sorcerer pretended to think about it, before shaking his head and calling for the next vision. Sir Leon looked up once he heard his name called, and paled, knowing Merlin would be experiencing the pain he felt in the battle before the Druids saved him with the Cup of Life.\nSurprising Leon, although he supposed given what he had seen, it shouldn\u2019t have shocked him, Merlin did not seem to be too ailed by experiencing Leon\u2019s worst wound. Merlin took the pain and simply lay there, waiting for the vision to end so he could move on.\nMerlin almost imperceptibly shrugged when Leon asked how, but Merlin replied: \u201cI suppose I\u2019m used to being close to death.\u201d Leon chose not to dwell on it, not wanting to know about how many times his friend had almost died.\nMerlin had only been out in Leon\u2019s vision for a short time, given the wound was one of immediate pain rather than a slow growing one, and for that, the other knights silently thanked the gods, and Leon for not having worse.\nArthur once again looked pained, but more so because he knew it meant soon Merlin would be experiencing the pain of the Questing Beast.\n\u201cPendragon. Your servant will now experience your worst wound. Think back to how much pain you were in, and sit there knowing Merlin will now feel that.\u201d\nThe rest of the knights joined in with Gwaine, planning their torture methods. Even Lancelot, who, despite being a knight, did not enjoy inflicting pain, was enjoying picturing the many ways he could use both his sword and his fists to hurt the sorcerer.\n\u201cMerlin\u201d Arthur said. The warlock turned to look at him. \u201cIt\u2019s the Questing Beast. I\u2019m sorry. But I have faith in you. You\u2019re the bravest man I\u2019ve ever met. You can get through this. We all believe in you. I believe in you.\u201d\nMerlin\u2019s eyes widened at Arthur\u2019s admission. His King was never quite so forthcoming about his feelings, or praise. \u201cWow. I must really be dying, huh.\u201d Merlin tried teasing Arthur, but the joke fell short.\nArthur smiled, though it was pained. Thankful for his friend\u2019s attempt at making him laugh, he said: \u201cOnce we get out of here, you\u2019ll never hear me say that again. Enjoy it.\u201d\nThis did get a smile out of Merlin, and Arthur felt his heart lighten at the sight. Although he promised himself once they did get out of there, he\u2019d say it again to Merlin. He\u2019d say it as many times as it took before Merlin believed it; so that he knew it to be as true as his own name. He vowed to make sure Merlin never once doubted Arthur\u2019s faith in him, and how much he truly cared about him. Arthur didn\u2019t let himself analyze the nature of his feelings, but maybe once they got out of here he would.\nSensing there was nothing left to be said, the sorcerer started the vision. The knights all watched on as they saw Arthur in the courtyard, surrounded by Knights of Camelot, and watched as Arthur got scratched by the beast. Merlin\u2019s initial pain was minimal, it felt more like a flesh wound, so he barely reacted. It was only once the vision cut to Arthur in his chambers that the pain began.\nMerlin was lost in the vision, body seizing and writhing as the pain searched for an exit, but finding none. For the first time since this whole thing had started, Arthur felt his eyes fill with tears, not wanting his friend to go through what he went through. Even though Arthur wasn\u2019t awake at the time, he had felt every moment of the dark magic running through and poisoning his veins when he had been attacked.\nMerlin made little noise this time, which was almost worse. Just small whimpers escaped him as the pain ripped through him. None of the knights could look, they simply closed their eyes and tried to imagine that all was fine. It happened at different intervals, so they were all unaware, but had they been speaking, they would know that all of them periodically opened their eyes just to check that their friend was actually still alive.\nOnly Arthur watched on, not wanting Merlin to experience the pain alone. Arthur tortured himself by watching Merlin, feeling better knowing that they were both hurting immensely, just in different ways.\nHours later, with Merlin never making any noise except those small whimpers, he finally woke up. Arthur never knew why the pain suddenly stopped, but he was grateful. It meant that now Merlin would be fine. Only the warlock who was too disoriented to speak or move knew that the length of time was wholly determined by how long it took for him to get to Nimueh and make the bargain. Not that he would ever tell anyone that.\n\u201cIt appears the only one left is you, Merlin.\u201d The sorcerer said, glancing with a look of disgust at the man laying below him.\nMerlin barely had the energy to open his eyes, let alone speak, but somehow he managed to push out. \u201cJust do it.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin\u2026\u201d he heard a voice say, recognizing it as Lancelot. He spoke again, Merlin presumed now addressing the sorcerer. \u201cPlease let him rest before you do this. His body will not handle it.\u201d\n\u201cYou presume to know his worst wound, Sir Lancelot?\u201d\n\u201cI do. And please let him rest.\u201d\n\u201cNo. He made this choice to replace his King. This is his punishment.\u201d\nThe Knights looked worryingly at Lancelot, used to seeing concern on his face in regards to Merlin, but this look of absolute terror was not one that they had seen before.\nGwaine, in a small moment of clarity, allowed himself to be scared that the wounds seemed to be increasing in pain level, and the fact that Merlin was last horrified him. Looking across at the others, it was clear they had made the same deductions.\nArthur noticed it too. \u201cWhy is he last? The wounds have been progressively getting worse. Why is Merlin last?\u201d\nThe sorcerer just chuckled, while Lancelot\u2019s face formed an even graver expression.\nLancelot then turned to Arthur as he spoke. \u201cSire, what I think you are about to see will be deeply distressing. Once Merlin is well, please let him explain.\u201d\nArthur, once again, was confused. But he nodded, giving his word to his knight.\nThe sorcerer grinned maniacally. \u201cI am going to enjoy this.\u201d\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s already here.\u201d Arthur felt himself pale as he heard Morgana\u2019s voice.\n\u201cDid you really think I was that stupid, Merlin?\u201d Merlin tried to escape, but was caught by one of the guards. The knights sucked in breaths when they heard how cruel Morgana sounded. Arthur hurt because he recognized this Morgana as the one who was still in Camelot; the one who had just returned to them.\nThe vision cut to Merlin, in chains that he couldn\u2019t escape.\nThe knights watched in horror as they felt themselves, as Merlin, look up to see Morgause staring down at them.\n\n\u201cYou intrigue me, Merlin. Why does a lowly servant continue to risk everything for Arthur and for Camelot? You know the answer, but you're not telling me. Why? Come on. Time and again you put your life on the line. There must be a reason.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI believe in a fair and just land.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd you think Arthur will give you that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd then what? You think you'll be recognised, Merlin? Is that it? All this so, one day, you can be a serving boy to the King? No. There's something more. Something you're not telling me, isn't there?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI told you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell, you can take your secret to your grave. Weorc untoworpenlic.\u201d\n\nThe knights felt the chains tighten. Lancelot thanked whatever gods there were that the vision cut straight to the Serkets arriving, as he knew it was likely Merlin tried to use magic to escape. Arthur was struck by Merlin\u2019s loyalty, even in the face of such danger. If it was even possible, he found himself more in awe of his friend than he was before.\nAt least 10 Serkets surrounded Merlin. He muttered something unintelligible (to the knights and Arthur, except Gwaine had a sneaking suspicion it was the language of the Old Religion) before one pierced him right in the shoulder.\nWith that, the vision ended for the men in the dungeon. Merlin\u2019s body arched and he made no noise whatsoever, but only a blind man couldn\u2019t see that he was in agony. His mouth was open in a silent scream, and his eyes seemed to be flickering beneath his eyelids.\nGwaine was in utter disbelief, but he voiced the question anyway. \u201cHe was stung by a Serket\u2026and survived?\u201d He turned to Lancelot as he asked, but the knight remained silent with his eyes screwed closed.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was possible\u201d muttered Elyan.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u201d said Leon.\nThey were brought out of their questioning when Merlin began thrashing around, still making no noise. The sorcerer looked on with something almost akin to sympathy, but he could not bring himself to actually feel remorse as he looked at the King, who was staring at his servant with a look so devastated that it could bring kingdoms to their knees.\n\u201cHow did he survive.\u201d Arthur spoke lowly, in a tone that chilled the knights.\nWhen no one answered, he spoke again. \u201cLancelot. How. Did. He. Survive.\u201d He punctuated each word through gritted teeth.\n\u201cIt is not my place, sire. But it does not matter. Merlin is currently experiencing pain that no man has ever lived through. We must be there to aid him when he wakes.\u201d\nThe knights steeled themselves, thankful for something else to focus their minds on, but Gwaine and Arthur were less ready to move on.\n\u201cHe\u2019s right, sire.\u201d Leon spoke up cautiously. \u201cThe point is that Merlin survived. And he\u2019s going through more pain right now than we can possibly comprehend. It doesn\u2019t matter how he survived, just that he did.\u201d\nArthur was surprised that Leon spoke so openly to him, since his knight very rarely did so. In that moment, he was thankful.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Leon.\u201d\nArthur allowed himself to look at Merlin again, only to immediately look away. Merlin looked dead. The only sign that he was alive was his really short breaths coming through his open mouth. He looked pale as a ghost and it looked like every muscle and limb was stretched as far as they could go in an attempt to expel the pain.\nAll of a sudden, Merlin spoke. His eyes were still closed, but the power radiating from his voice shocked the knights. Lancelot recognized it as him calling the dragon, and his eyes darted around hoping no one else did. \u201c\u03a9 \u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd, \u03ad\u03ac\u03c9 \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c6\u03b8\u03ad\u03b3\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b5 \u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c9!\u201d\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Leon asked. It sounded a lot like a magical language to him.\nLancelot jumped in to respond. \u201cProbably just muttering brought on by the pain.\u201d\nThe knights definitely didn\u2019t believe him, and they all looked between each other searching for some kind of answer. Arthur was still deadly quiet. There was no indication he had even registered what they said. When Merlin didn\u2019t speak again, they chalked it up to what Lancelot said, and went back to worrying about their friend. Gwaine knew better, but he certainly wasn\u2019t going to bring it up.\nThey had no way of knowing, but the knights were sure Merlin was suffering for around half a day by the time he woke up. They only knew because at one point or another they had all fallen asleep from the exhaustion, despite not wanting to leave their friend.\nMerlin fell still, and Elyan and Leon woke to Gwaine yelling: \u201cMerlin! What\u2019s wrong with him! Wake him up!\u201d\nThe sorcerer waved his hand over Merlin, and he opened his eyes once more. They were unfocused, but he was aware of the knights and Arthur telling the sorcerer to let Merlin go now that this was over.\nThe man looked at Emrys, and deemed he had suffered enough pain. His eyes then turned to Arthur.\n\u201cYou have been here for two days, young King. And you have endured much heartache here. However, after all you have seen, you have missed the most important truth. I will not allow you to leave until you know all.\u201d\n\u201cWhat truth?\u201d Arthur asked.\n\u201cThe truth is not mine, Pendragon. It is his.\u201d The sorcerer looked at Merlin at that. The warlock was groaning, but looked up at the sorcerer as he was addressed.\nHe then spoke directly to Merlin. \u201cI will leave you all here. You have only one way of escape, or you will all die. You know what to do. If the prophecies are true, you are capable of it, and I believe you will begin the Golden Age should you escape. If you cannot, then the Pendragon line is over, and my work will be complete.\u201d\nMerlin was weak, but he scowled at him and said: \u201cthose who meddle with destiny are not favoured by the gods.\u201d\nThe sorcerer smiled. \u201cI do not need to be favoured by the gods. Avalon will welcome me with open arms no matter the conclusion.\u201d\nMerlin scoffed.\nThe knights and Arthur watched the exchange in confusion. They noticed they seemed to be in a perpetual state of that.\nThe sorcerer turned to the others. \u201cI hope your eyes have been opened, Arthur Pendragon. I bid you leave.\u201d\nGwaine struggled against his chains. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave us here!\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary, Sir Gwaine. I can.\u201d\nGwaine growled. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d\nThe sorcerer looked on amused. \u201cI believe your King will wish to do that. Goodbye.\u201d He turned to Merlin. Emrys.\nMerlin scowled again.\nThe sorcerer left the dungeon, with everyone still chained to the wall, and Merlin with his wrists shackled, extremely weak.\n\u201cMerlin, are you alright?\u201d Lancelot asked.\n\u201cI will be. I just need to rest for a few minutes.\u201d He replied quietly.\n\u201cHow, Merlin?\u201d Arthur asked in a voice so soft and quiet that it caused Merlin to open his eyes and stare at him.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about it.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\n\u201cEasy, princess. Let him rest.\u201d Gwaine said, as he threw a look at Merlin, who responded with a grateful look. \u201cWe need to figure out how to get out of here.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no way out.\u201d Arthur said, sounding very resigned to his fate. \u201cThese chains won\u2019t budge, and the sorcerer isn\u2019t coming back.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get out.\u201d Merlin said, yet again with confidence that he really had no business having in that situation.\n\u201cHow?\u201d Percival spoke for the first time in hours.\n\u201cI need to rest for a while, then I\u2019ll get us out.\u201d Merlin said.\nArthur scoffed, but asked with interest. \u201cAnd how do you plan to do that? You\u2019re chained too.\u201d\nMerlin looked him in the eye. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d\nArthur was stunned, but looking at the earnest look in his friends\u2019 eye, he simply nodded.\n\u201cGood. I\u2019ll get us out, and then I\u2019ll answer all of your questions. I promise. No more secrets.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin\u2026\u201d Lancelot warned.\n\u201cNo more secrets, Lance.\u201d\nLancelot sighed. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nArthur was hit with an unwelcome surge of jealousy knowing that there were things Lancelot knew about Merlin that he didn\u2019t, but he pushed it down. Now was not the time for any thoughts that weren\u2019t about making sure Merlin was okay they escaped.\nAn hour later, after an uncomfortable period of silence where the knights watched Merlin simply lie there, their friend sat up. They couldn\u2019t wrap their heads around what they had just seen, and Merlin didn\u2019t seem to be very forthcoming at the moment.\n\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d Merlin said.\n\u201cOkay, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d Gwaine asked.\n\u201cI get out of these chains, and then I break yours.\u201d\n\u201cHow exactly are you going to do that?\u201d Arthur says.\n\u201cBetter that you don\u2019t know beforehand sire.\u201d That worried Arthur. Merlin never called him sire. He was about to warn him not to do anything stupid that would get himself killed before Merlin did something that he never could have predicted.\nMerlin closed his eyes, and felt his magic underneath his skin, that had been steadily growing for the last hour. The intense pain he felt had left him unable to do anything, but now he could control it. He felt his magic being restrained by the shackles, but his power was too strong to be stopped by iron. He felt his magic fill him, let himself get lost in the feeling, allowed a moment to enjoy how whole he felt, before he opened his eyes and focused all his energy on the chains.\nArthur gasped as Merlin opened his eyes that were now glowing gold, and the chains exploded in sparks of golden light, dropping to the floor. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026you\u2019re a\u2026\u201d he couldn\u2019t get the words out.\nMerlin, with now blue eyes, looked at him, and he was surprised that he still looked the same. No malice, no evil that came with magic, just Merlin. Merlin smiled sadly, before waving his hands and unlocking everyone from their chains.\nNo one moved, too shocked to do anything but stare, (except Gwaine, who had a smug look on his face and was proud of himself for figuring it out), until Lancelot got up and hugged Merlin.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay, my friend.\u201d\nMerlin smiled shakily and mumbled \u201cYou too\u201d into his shoulder. He then let go and looked at all the knights, resolutely ignoring Arthur. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d\nMerlin left and walked out without checking to see if anyone was following him. Lancelot stayed behind for a second, and turned to look at Arthur. \u201cYou promised you\u2019d let him explain.\u201d\nArthur simply nodded again, too stunned to do anything else.\nLancelot spoke again. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nThey all stood up, joints protesting at moving for the first time in days, and followed behind. Arthur followed last, but he eventually left the dungeon and stepped out into the forest, where it was midday. He allowed himself to adjust to the newfound light, and then searched for Merlin.\nHe found the knights standing in a circle around Merlin, not standing too close, but clearly not scared of him, more in awe. Arthur walked up as he heard Gwaine saying: \u201chow on earth did you survive a serket sting?\u201d\nMerlin replied: \u201cI should wait for Arthur so I can explain everything to all of you together. I only have one chance at this.\u201d As he began to walk, his legs buckled, only being caught in time by Lancelot.\n\u201cYou need to sit, Merlin. Your body can\u2019t handle this much so soon.\u201d\nMerlin sighed. \u201cOkay. I don\u2019t remember being this tired the first time you know.\u201d Lancelot just shook his head.\nArthur walked up and pushed through the knights as he saw Lancelot leaning Merlin against a tree. They looked up at him and both tensed, before Lancelot stood up straight, blocking Merlin slightly from view.\n\u201cArthur\u2026\u201d Lancelot started.\n\u201cMove, Lancelot.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cI will not allow you to harm him.\u201d\nArthur rolled his eyes. \u201cI gave you my word I would let him explain. I will. Now move.\u201d\nLancelot looked unsure, but he stepped to the side anyway.\nMerlin looked up at Arthur, grief, sorrow and overwhelming fear on his face. \u201cArthur I-\u201c\nArthur help up his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou said you would let me explain!\u201d\n\u201cAnd I will. We\u2019re all going to sit down, and you are going to tell us everything. You will start from the beginning. Start from when you started committing treason in Camelot by learning sorcery.\u201d He spat the words out. Gwaine sucked in a breath beside him, shifting noticeably towards Merlin. \u201cI won\u2019t harm him until he explains, Gwaine. Sit down.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t harm him at all\u201d muttered Gwaine. \u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d Merlin clearly heard him and shot him a grateful smile.\nAnd so Merlin began. \u201cTo start with, I never learned sorcery.\u201d Merlin held up his hand before Arthur interrupted and called him a liar. \u201cI\u2019m a warlock, I was born with magic. Yes Leon, that\u2019s possible.\u201d Merlin also answered that question before Leon even had a chance to open his mouth to ask. Merlin laughed slightly. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t read minds, I just know you and I knew you were going to ask.\u201d Leon\u2019s lips twitched slightly. Merlin continued. \u201cI was born with magic. I was moving things with my mind before I could even talk. My powers grew until it got to a point where my mother knew it wasn\u2019t safe for me in Ealdor anymore, so she sent me to Camelot to learn to control them.\u201d\n\u201cYou learned from Gaius.\u201d Arthur said, knowing it to be true.\nMerlin stilled. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cRelax, Merlin. He is guilty of nothing.\u201d\nMerlin smiled and continued. \u201cVery soon I discovered that I had a destiny. A destiny to protect you, Arthur, and help you unite Albion in peace and prosperity. There is a prophecy that says this will come to pass. You, the Once and Future King, and me, Emrys. Although I didn\u2019t know until later that that was my name in prophecy, but I am Emrys. Supposedly the most powerful sorcerer who has ever and who will ever live.\u201d Arthur was about to scoff at that, but seeing what he saw earlier, he realized how true it might be.\nPercival looked shocked. \u201cYou\u2019re Emrys?\u201d\nMerlin looked confused. \u201cYes? You know of the prophecy?\u201d\n\u201cI heard stories when I was a child, of a sorcerer who would guide Albion into the light and bring about a Golden Age. That\u2019s you.\u201d\nMerlin had the gall to look embarrassed. \u201cSupposedly, yes.\u201d\nPercival\u2019s mouth made a perfect \u2018O\u2019 as he breathed out \u201cwow\u201d.\nArthur rolled his eyes. \u201cContinue.\u201d He said.\nAnd so Merlin recounted every single thing he had done in Camelot to protect the kingdom and Arthur. Arguments broke out, tears were shed as Merlin told the story of how he released the Great Dragon, and lost his father only moments after finding him. The knights gasped at they heard the stories of their friend\u2019s bravery, Arthur got incredibly quiet as he heard how Merlin traded his life for Arthur\u2019s, they smiled at the tales of the goblin. Arthur yelled, Merlin yelled back, and the world witnessed the beginning of a new era.\nAs it all came to an end, and the knights and Arthur sat mulling over all that had been shared, Gwaine realized one answer was missing. \u201cMerlin. You still haven\u2019t told us how you survived the Serket.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Merlin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not too exciting. I called Kilgarrah just before I passed out. He took me somewhere safe and used his magic to save me. I returned to Camelot a little under two days later.\u201d\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what that was.\u201d Gwaine said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWe heard you say something while you were in the vision. It sounded like a magical language. I definitely heard the word dragon in there.\u201d Leon added.\nMerlin looked sheepish. \u201cOh\u201d. Arthur rolled his eyes at his knights.\n\u201cWhen was this? When were you stung?\u201d Arthur asked.\n\u201cYou remember when I told you I was dying not too long after Morgana returned?\u201d\nArthur replied flatly. \u201cYou were actually dying.\u201d\nMerlin grinned. \u201cYes.\u201d\nGwaine laughed. Lancelot coughed to hide his laugh, and Arthur rolled his eyes again.\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve told me.\u201d\nMerlin sobered. \u201cNo I couldn\u2019t have. That would mean explaining that Morgana did it, and you wouldn\u2019t have believed me. I don\u2019t blame you, you had only just got her back. But no, I couldn\u2019t have told you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d, Arthur said.\nMerlin\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI said I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019ve had to deal with all of this alone.\u201d\nMerlin smiled and looked at Lancelot. \u201cWell, not alone\u201d\nLancelot smiled back at him, and Arthur felt that surge of jealousy again. If he wasn\u2019t so sure that Lancelot was infatuated with Gwen, he would have felt a lot worse.\n\u201cNo more\u201d Arthur said.\n\u201cNo more what?\u201d Merlin asked.\n\u201cNo more secrets. I\u2019m still angry with you for lying, but I understand why you did. You don\u2019t need to anymore. And ultimately, no more doing this alone. From now on, we\u2019re all here for you. I\u2019m not going to let you get hurt again.\u201d Each and every knight nodded, knowing they would do anything to ensure Merlin never felt the pain, physical and emotional, again. Arthur choked up on that last sentence, the images of Merlin being tortured too much for him to bear.\nMerlin teared up as he looked at his friends. \u201cThank you, all of you.\u201d\nArthur smiled at him, the smile that he seemed to reserve only for his manservant, that showed just how much he cared about him.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to Camelot\u201d Arthur said. \u201cI believe I have some laws to revise.\u201d\nMerlin\u2019s jaw dropped again, tears still in his eyes. \u201cWhat? What laws?\u201d\n\u201cKeep up Merlin, there are some laws on magic to review.\u201d\nActual tears fell for Merlin now. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\nArthur smiled again. \u201cIf you have magic, if you are magic Merlin, then magic cannot be evil.\u201d\nThe other knights smiled softly at that, looking between the king and the warlock. They all knew this would be the dawn of what Percival described as the Golden Age, and they felt privileged to get to see it.\nAs the company began their walk back to Camelot, Arthur felt happier than he ever had. He felt like every piece of his life was falling into place. As he looked at Merlin, who looked back at him with his eyes lit up in joy and an utterly ridiculous grin on his face, Arthur knew there was only one thing left to complete him.\n\u2018No more secrets\u2019 he thought to himself, as he decided that he would share the only one he had left, and dared to hope that that was Merlin\u2019s only secret left too.\nSpoiler, it was. Affection masked by insults ensued. Rambling was cut off by kissing. Arthur was very smug at finally shutting up his warlock.\n\u00a0"
