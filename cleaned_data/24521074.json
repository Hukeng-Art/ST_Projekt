    "text": "\u201cHere you go, old man.\u201d\nKlaus puts the coffee on the table, watching Five snatch it and cradle it with both hands close to his chest. The cup is steaming hot, literally steaming from the heat, but Five either doesn\u2019t care or doesn\u2019t notice. Pulling out his own chair from the small round table Klaus plops down on his seat, one arm thrown of the back of his chair while he crosses one leg over the other.\n\u201cI made sure to order it as black and bitter as your soul, so there\u2019s probably enough caffeine in there to keep you awake for the rest of your teenage years.\u201d\nFive ignores him in favor of taking a sip of the coffee. His throat makes a noise of pleasure at the taste and Klaus takes a drag of his blended strawberry lemonade to hide his grin at the sight of his grouch of a brother looking like a little kid for once.\n\u201cWipe that look of your face,\u201d Five says, putting his cup back down.\nKlaus blinks innocently and mirrors the action. \u201cWhat look?\u201d\nFive looks unimpressed, raising an eyebrow. \u201cTaking credit for something you didn\u2019t do, typical of you.\u201d He snorts.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Klaus whines, resting his chin on his palm, elbow on the table. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t be a dick. A bit of gratitude wouldn\u2019t hurt. I came out here in the middle of the night with you out of the kindness in my heart and you\u2019re being a cranky little shit.\u201d\n\u201cYou offered.\u201d Five reminds him but his voice lacks the previous bite. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to.\u201d\nTrue, Klaus did come up with the idea of going out, telling Five to get dressed when he found him sulking on the couch, grumbling to thin air about the lack of coffee in the house. An old habit from Dolores he still hadn\u2019t managed to break out of. But hey, Klaus does the talking to \u201cthin air\u201d all the time, so he can\u2019t judge. The more the merrier.\nThere was nothing to do anyway with the others asleep. Out of his siblings, Klaus found himself awake more often than not at the oddest hours with his shitty sleeping schedule. Sobriety had the downside of turning the volume of the ghosts up to a new level of loudness much like the shitty soap operas Allison liked to watch on the TV when they were kids. Without a remote to turn them down and the nightmares haunting him, sleep was a rarity, another drug he couldn\u2019t get enough of. Literally.\nFive didn\u2019t look like he would go back to sleep either. Taking him out for a coffee at the nearest Starbucks to get him into a better mood seemed like a nice idea. As long as Klaus didn\u2019t have to pay, he wouldn\u2019t mind ordering a coffee for him. Most employees shied away from giving in to the crazy eyes and the unhinged smile Five tried to pull to get his way. To stop his brother from snapping in a fit of violent temper Klaus would rather endure the dirty stares from the woman at the counter and the middle-aged man nursing his own drink and a book a few tables to their right for giving a kid caffeine.\nThere were worse things than coffee for a growing kid and Klaus has done most of them. A coffee was laughable in comparison. Allison would give him the stare of disapproval most Mothers have but what she didn\u2019t know wouldn\u2019t get him banned from her closet.\nKlaus wiggles his finger like a parent chiding their child.\n\u201cThank you, Klaus.\u201d He pitches his voice higher. \u201cYou\u2019re such a good brother! I\u2019m sorry my ungrateful ass can\u2019t appreciate you, please forgive me my rudeness.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off.\u201d Five deadpans, kicking him under the table. Klaus yelps, ignoring the looks from the three other people inside the caf\u00e9 with the ease of years of practice. Lips quirking up, Five gives the onlookers a tight smile.\n\u201cChrist, we\u2019re getting you some anger management classes.\u201d\nKlaus groans, shaking his head before taking another drag from his straw. The sweetness coating his throat soothes the burst of irritation at the new bruise on his knee.\n\u201cAll that rage in such a tiny body, it can\u2019t be healthy. You need a better outlet than poor me. Maybe a pottery course or something. I\u2019ll show you how to knit if I have to, it\u2019s very relaxing.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll stab you with the knitting needles.\u201d Five says pleasantly, taking a gulp of his coffee.\nKlaus throws out a hand. \u201cSee?\u201d He slouches back into his seat, hooking his legs around the legs of his chair so Five can\u2019t reach them with his foot. \u201cYou\u2019re just proving my point, y\u2019know.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d Five huffs, rolling his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fully capable of controlling my temper.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Klaus chokes on a mouthful of lemonade. He pats himself on the chest a few times. Five wrinkles his nose as he wipes at the corner of his mouth to stare him down.\n\u201cSays the guy who threw a glass at Luther\u2019s head for asking if he needs help getting something from the top shelf in the kitchen.\u201d\n\u201cThat was deserved.\u201d Five grumbles, fingers tightening around the handle of his cup.\n\u201cYou hide Allison\u2019s notebook for three hours after she took away your margarita.\u201d Klaus points out watching Five\u2019s jaw strain under the force of gritting his teeth.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a child.\u201d Five spits out, bitter like his coffee. \u201cShe keeps forgetting that. A reminder couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\nKlaus holds up his hands in a placating manner, his tattoos on display for Five to read.\n\u201cGeez, pretty touchy today, aren\u2019t we? Cool it, buddy, I was just trying to prove my point. But y\u2019know the others take everything they see or cannot see at face value. Nearly broke poor Ben\u2019s heart.\u201d\nFive\u2019s lips purse in thought, eyes straying around the room. \u201cIs Ben here?\u201d\n\u201cAfraid not.\u201d\nKlaus pauses, clasping his hands together with a giggle. Five didn\u2019t seem disappointed at the lack of their ghost brother but it still felt a bit weird to be without Ben if he was honest. He\u2019s sure some distance once in a while would do them some good, but Ben never left his side for too long. An hour, maybe one and a half then he would be back, popping out of nowhere and nagging at him for not wearing clothes appropriate for the weather.\n\u201cI left him behind to watch some telly. Since it\u2019s you I was going out with, he didn\u2019t seem too worried about me getting in trouble and stayed behind to watch some movie he\u2019d been pestering me about all week long. I can summon him if you want, but he might just knock your cup of coffee out of your hands like some poltergeist, because he\u2019s petty like that.\u201d\nAnd still a little angry over the fact nobody believed he\u2019d been there, watching over him all this time, but he\u2019s here to get Five to relax, not to guilt trip him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Five dismisses him. \u201cYou\u2019re good for now.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Klaus preens, grinning. \u201cThat\u2019s gotta be the nicest thing you\u2019ve said to me.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get used to it.\u201d\nKlaus gasps, laying a hand over his heart to be dramatic. \u201cI would never.\u201d\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d Five sighs, but his shoulders relax, a faint smile tugging at his lips and Klaus grins.\nGod was it hard to be mad at the grumpy face glaring half-heartedly at him despite the jabs and the trouble he\u2019d brought with him at his return. Almost made it seem worth it to get tortured by two freaks in masks on his behalf, just to see him smile like they were kids again. Trying his hardest to appear stern but failing and hiding his faint smile behind a cup of coffee.\nBlame his reactions on Five\u2019s kid appearance but seeing him smile never failed to bring a matching grin onto Klaus\u2019s lips. Sharp tongue or not, it was in moments like these that Klaus couldn\u2019t doubt Five cared for them.\nHe hadn\u2019t been sure at the beginning with the indifference to everything that wasn\u2019t the apocalypse or related to it, the coldness and distance\u2014the lack of care in regards to his disappearance and time-travel or Vanya\u2019s whereabouts\u2014but Five never worked well under stress. It shut off everything in his mind except for the need to survive and left no room for anything else.\nWith the apocalypse avoided there was no need to cut his losses, to shove the walls of cold rationally back up and hide himself away with the burden of the world resting on his shoulder.\nFive was still an asshole more often than not, cocky to the point of mean, but without the additional stress, his attitude got bearable.\nEmptying his lemonade, he noisily slurped on his straw until Five throws him a scowl and drowns the rest of his coffee like Klaus does his shots.\n\u201cGet me another one.\u201d\nKlaus tilts his head. \u201cWeird. I didn\u2019t hear a please in your order, Fivey.\u201d He cups his ear and leans forward.\n\u201cNot as weird as you still sitting here.\u201d Five\u2019s lips pull back into a tooth baring smile. \u201cI hate repeating myself.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know it?\u201d\nKlaus rises to his feet, smoothing down his jacket with flourish.\n\u201cMister \u201cI\u2019ll teleport you to the roof because you didn\u2019t get the math equation right the second time around\u201d hates an awful lot. The list of things you hate is longer than Santa\u2019s gift list. I cannot believe Benny thought you\u2019d make a good babysitter! The idea of leaving you alone with a child is giving me anxiety. Just look at what you did to innocent Kenny, rejecting him so harshly! I bet he\u2019s talking about you in therapy.\u201d\n\u201cAt least he gets the chance to go to therapy.\u201d\nFive crosses his arms and scowls when a woman comes into the caf\u00e9 and hurries to the counter to order.\u00a0\n\u201cOther people didn\u2019t get that chance after meeting me.\u201d\nRight. Because they died. Horribly. Klaus can see them actually. Cowering in the corner of the room, glaring daggers at Five and dripping blood over the floor but otherwise silent and unmoving. Figures ghosts would be scared of his little psycho brother even in death.\n\u201cNo talking about murder during meal times.\u201d Klaus says putting his hands on his hips and tries to look stern. \u201cYou know the rules, old man. My appetite is delicate, so don\u2019t ruin it.\u201d\nFive is unimpressed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t eating anything.\u201d He says flatly.\n\u201cTouch\u00e9, mein Bruder. But drinking smoothies counts as a meal for me like coffee does for you. Equality for everyone and all that shit. Don\u2019t make me get Ben to yell at you.\u201d\n\u201cJust get me my damned coffee already.\u201d\nFive pinches the bridge of his nose and waves a hand to shoo him away.\nKlaus salutes. \u201cSo bossy! I\u2019m not sure I dig that, but whatever floats your boat, brother dearest.\u201d He winks, giggling at Five\u2019s expression of disgust and skips towards the counter where the woman waits.\nShe gives him a look, the one of judgment over letting a kid, most likely his son in her eyes, hang out in a Starbucks at night that screams \u201cShame on your parenting skills\u201d.\nJokes on her, though, because if age counts, he\u2019s the little kid in this situation. There are worse things one could do to a child than expand their bed time. He\u2019s got a list in his head filed away under the name \u201cDad\u201d to prove it but he\u2019s not in the mood to start a fight with some woman over trivial matters he couldn\u2019t give a fuck about. Let her think he\u2019s a shit father, his nonexistent child could cry over it or maybe write a book about his shitty parenting. Vanya would have a field-day giving out tips.\nLost in thought, he doesn\u2019t hear the men storming into the caf\u00e9 until the barista gasps and freezes with wide, fearful eyes.\n\u201cNobody moves!\u201d One of them barks as he whirls around. \u201cOr we\u2019ll shot you!\u201d\nOh shit.\nA fucking robbery at what, half past midnight? Really?\nKlaus grimaces at the three guys, each holding a gun, standing back to back with each other as they step forward, wearing clich\u00e9 masks to hide their face like in the movies. They\u2019re tall, as tall as him but double the size in muscles.\nThe woman behind him steadies herself on the counter.\n\u201cNobody has to get hurt.\u201d\nThe tallest one says with a glower, gun aimed at the barista as Klaus and the woman inch to the side to get out of the crossfire line.\n\u201cAll we want is the money in the cash registers. You, woman, move your ass and put it in the bag and we\u2019ll be going on our merrier way.\u201d\nThe guy to his right throws the bag over the counter before he returns to his post of pointing a gun at Five.\nFive, who looks pissed.\nProbably because he can\u2019t do anything rash with one of the gun\u2019s switching between aiming at the barista and the woman who stands next to Klaus, crying silently and the other one pointing at the man sitting at his table, halfway through his book.\nTeleporting might give him an advantage for a moment, but they\u2019d shot and even if the Academy is nothing but a painful reminder, they still have the instinct to protect innocent people from harm whenever they could.\nIf Five teleports, one of their targets would be gone but four would remain. He could knock off the aim of one but the other would fire and blood would spill. Even if Klaus were to shove the woman next to him over the counter and the other would duck, that\u2019d leave him at a distance the shot couldn\u2019t miss.\n\u201cFaster!\u201d One of them barks as the barista starts to whimper.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d She cries, trembling and trying to get the cash register to open. \u201c\u2014it\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s stuck!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a minute.\u201d The guy threatens. \u201cOne minute to get the job done before I shot you in your ugly face.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry! Please, I\u2019m trying!\u201d She shakes the cash register. Her mascara is running down her cheeks like her tears as she sobs.\n\u201cChill out, man.\u201d\nKlaus blurts out, feeling Five\u2019s eyes boring into the side of his head in warning to keep his mouth as the man turns to him. What can he say? He\u2019s always been the lookout or the distraction, it\u2019s what he\u2019s best at after all.\nTime to buy her some time.\n\u201cNo need to be an asshole. She\u2019s trying her best to help you rob her, screaming at her won\u2019t get you what you want, so take a chill pill and let her do what you want her to do in peace. Look at the poor girl, she\u2019s frightened like a rabbit. You don\u2019t want her to die from fright, do you? That\u2019s just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d\nThe man shouts, pointing his gun at Klaus and the woman next to him shrinks back from him like he caught himself on fire.\n\u201cI swear if you don\u2019t shut your mouth, I\u2019m gonna shut it for you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, kinky.\u201d\nHe laughs, the sound hysterical because it reminds him a bit too much of his time with Cha Cha and Hazel for his liking.\nThe man seems speechless for a moment, the guy on the right snorts and he hears Five hiss something underneath his breath before the man to the left takes a step closer with his gun to silence him.\nThe cash register slams open and the barista sighs in relief, wasting no time to put the money in the bag as fast as she can.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll kill her.\u201d\n\nThe voice of a woman has him blink and if he takes a closer look, he can see a girl hovering behind the group of robbers. She\u2019s pretty aside from the bruise marks on her throat and the bruising of a night sky across her jaw.\n\n\u201cJust like he killed me.\u201d\n\nKlaus meets her dead gaze with his own to show he\u2019s listening. She steps through the man, who shivers unconsciously, eyes growing wide when she notices he can see her and steps closer, her summer dress swaying with her hips.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an ex-girlfriend. Just like me.\u201d\n\nShe explains, eyes stuck onto the barista with a frown on her blue lips.\n\n\u201cHe killed me out of jealously. Choked me in my bedroom after breaking in and after he was done, he threw my corpse into a river. He\u2019ll kill her too. For calling it quits, just like he did to me. As soon as she throws the bag over the counter, he\u2019ll shot her and then, he\u2019ll run like the coward he is.\u201d\n\nHer voice fills with a malice so bitter Klaus feels goose bumps break out on his skin. Bloodshot eyes flashing with anger, her pretty face is twisted into a fierce glare. If she could, Klaus doesn\u2019t doubt she\u2019d kill the guy with her bare hands.\nToo bad he can\u2019t make her corporal for that. Flashing blue light from his palms would draw attention to himself and get him shot faster than he could manifest her.\n\u201cDon\u2019t move, kid.\u201d\nThe guy on the left warns when Five shifts on his feet, face blank.\n\u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d The barista sniffles, whipping at her eyes with her hand and holding up the bag.\n\u201cWhat\u2026what should I do now?\u201d\nHer voice trembles, lips quivering and she reminds him of Vanya. Long brown hair, tiny with eyes that put Bambi\u2019s to shame. She looks younger, at the age most teenagers get a job to pay for their first apartment and she\u2019s whiter than the paint on the walls. She tries to shrink into herself, eyes puffy and Klaus\u2019s chest twists at the thought of her wandering around as a ghost like the young woman he distantly hears speaking to him.\n\u201cThrow me the bag.\u201d The guy says, gesturing for her to hurry up.\nThe ghost snarls, flipping him off. \u201cFuck you, you piece of shit\u2014\"\nShe throws the bag and Klaus moves.\nHe doesn\u2019t think, doesn\u2019t hesitate.\nHe shoves the other woman to the ground, steps in front of the barista just as the man pulls the trigger.\nThe gun goes off, pain pierces his chest, and he stumbles backwards.\nThe sound of a scream rings in his ears\u2014\nHis legs slide out underneath him. The back of his head cracks against a hard surface.\n\u2014and everything goes black.\n\n\u201cYou again?\u201d\n\n\nThe upside-down face of a girl greets him as soon as his eyes crack open. Her dark skin glows faintly, greyer than the trees, the grass or the flowers around them. The darkest part of her are her eyes, darker and deeper than the blackest ink or the bottom of the ocean. \n\n\nThey don\u2019t seem happy to see him.\n\n\n\u201cHello to you too, sweetheart.\u201d \n\n\nHe groans, sitting up and tugging at the ends of his vibrant blue crop top. \n\n\n\u201cGlad to see you didn\u2019t brush up the place with new colors. Still a fan of the sixty\u2019s movie setting, huh?\u201d\n\n\nShe scoffs, rocking back on her heels. \u201cYou don\u2019t listen very well, do you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNope!\u201d He rises to his feet and stretches. \u201cI always was a rule breaker, just ask dear old Dad. Speaking of him, I\u2019m not gonna have another run in with him this time, right? I\u2019d hate to see him so soon. The wounds are still fresh, y\u2019know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you here.\u201d She says flatly and the resemblance to Five is uncanny. Same preteen body full of knowledge and power. She even got his savage looks down.\n\n\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me like that, it\u2019s not like I asked to be shot, it\u2026it just happened. Okay, so maybe, maybe I did move into the line of fire but it was for a good cause, I swear!\u201d\n\n\nShe taps her foot. \u201cDon\u2019t care.\u201d\n\n\nOuch. That stung.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a very good host, you know that?\u201d He asks, rubbing at the back of his head.\n\n\n\u201cUsually I don\u2019t have to speak to the people that come here.\u201d She huffs. \u201cAlso, you\u2019re annoying.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOne of my many talents.\u201d He agrees solemnly and looks around. \n\n\nThere\u2019s no barber shop in the distance, just a long road. There\u2019s a lake in the distance, the water milky white instead of dark grey or black.\n\n\n\u201cHey, is there any chance I can\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d She cuts him off harshly, glaring up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t like you being here, the shorter, the better. You\u2019re not supposed to be here and yet you show up here as if it\u2019s your friend\u2019s house.\u201d\n\n\nShe looks second away from stomping her foot in frustration, glowering at him.\n\n\nHe blinks. \u201cGee, sorry for waltzing in unannounced. Should I knock next time, call out \u201cI\u2019m home, honey!\u201d?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t show up.\u201d She snaps back. \u201cAt all. Not before it\u2019s time. Got that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Klaus coos, resisting the urge to pinch her cheeks at the fire sparking in her gaze. No need to antagonize God. He\u2019d hoped for a chance to see Dave, but judging from the nothingness he sees and the bristling fury in front of him, the chances are so low they\u2019re nonexistent. \n\n\nIt sucks but there\u2019s nothing he can do. \n\n\nStill, it hurts and he squeezes his eyes shut at the throb of pain in his chest, breathing in deeply.\n\n\nWho would have thought people could breathe in the afterlife?\n\n\nBen didn\u2019t need to breath and\u2014oh fuck. Ben.\n\n\nHe\u2019s so gonna get his ass kicked back here for disappearing once again. Last time was bad enough. Ben rounded on him, all teary concern and anger born out of fear. He\u2019d promised not to vanish, or die, whatever and he\u2019s broken it. Just like he\u2019s broken nearly everything else he touched.\n\n\nBen didn\u2019t deserve this. And neither did Five.\n\n\nThough, Five might just write off. He was effective like that. As long as Klaus would come back to life, wake up or didn\u2019t die permanently he shouldn\u2019t have a problem with his death. It might come in handy, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about another Hazel and Cha Cha incident, though he didn\u2019t even worry the first time around. Nobody did.\n\n\nWhen he turns to look at the small girl, she\u2019s gone. He breathes out a sigh and walks towards the lake, hands stuffed into his empty pockets. The grass turns into sand, pebbles scattered around and he crouches down to pick some up.\n\n\nTurning to the lake, he runs his fingers of the smooth stone in his hand before pulling his arm back.\n\n\nHis wrist snaps forward and the pebble skips across the surface trice before the water swallows it. He curses and tries again.\n\n\nDiego could throw them to the end of the lake. They\u2019ve done this enough as kids. He\u2019d rub it into Luther\u2019s face, who would call him a cheater and a fight would break out. Leaving both of them with bruises and spit lips, refusing to speak to each other for the rest of the day.\n\n\nHe watches another stone skip over the lake, four times this time and scowls.\n\n\n\u201cTry bending your wrist a little more.\u201d\n\n\nHis blood runs cold.\n\n\n\u201cFuck off.\u201d He groans, not turning around to face the owner of the voice, fingers tightening around the stone in his grasp until his knuckles become stark white.\n\n\nThe footsteps come closer. \n\n\n\u201cYou need to bend your wrist all the way back to get more power into the snap, otherwise it won\u2019t slide out of your fingers and across the water, Number Four.\u201d\n\n\nKlaus throws the stone and it hits the water with a splash, sinking straight through, causing ripples on the surface. He hears a heavy sigh behind him.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only giving you advice and pointing out what you\u2019re doing wrong. Must you always fight me on everything?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, Daddy dearest.\u201d\n\n\nKlaus spits out, heat bubbling underneath his icy skin. \n\n\n\u201cEver considered the possibility that I don\u2019t want your shitty advice? Of course, you haven\u2019t. It\u2019s you after all. But let me remind you, you\u2019re awfully quick to point fingers at us, dear Papa, but how does it feel to know you were in the wrong all along?\u201d\n\n\nReginald stays silent.\n\n\nKlaus swallows down the lump in his throat, feeling his skin flush only to cool, the nausea tying knots in his stomach. His heart is beating fast, the anger unfurling in his lungs like a wildfire.\n\n\nHe\u2019s so upset, he\u2019s choking on his fury, making himself dizzy. \n\n\nThere are so many things he wants to say, to scream and spit at Reginald, but they\u2019re stuck in his throat. All the accusations, the misgivings and hurt get tangled into a knot he can\u2019t unfurl, not until he has an answer.\n\n\nHe\u2019s not so na\u00efve to think he\u2019ll\u2014they\u2019ll ever get an apology out of the man. \n\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d He sneers, eyes burning. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to say anything? No, grand speech about the fact you were the fucking cause of the apocalypse? For ruining us? C\u2019mon, you never wasted an opportunity to have the last word!\u201d\n\n\nReginald had driven Five to the end of the world, Vanya to madness, Ben to death, Luther to isolation, Diego to a life full of loneliness and Allison to one of delusion. He\u2019d driven Klaus to ruin himself with the mausoleum, to a point of numbness not even death could reach.\n\n\nHe\u2019d ruined them like their powers ruined their lives.\n\n\nAnd he wasn\u2019t regretful, not about them, but like he said last time, about his own choices.\n\n\nBut never about them.\n\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t wrong, Number Four, don\u2019t be so pretentious to twist the truth.\u201d\n\n\nKlaus can\u2019t breathe past the flames blazing inside his chest. \n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\nHe turns around to see Reginald pursing his lips, eyes glancing from his face to his shoes. Arms clasped behind his back, the self-righteous pride shining in his eyes is sickening. \n\n\nThe stone slips through Klaus\u2019s fingers to sink into the sand.\n\n\n\u201cYou stopped the apocalypse or did you not?\u201d \n\n\nReginald says in a voice Klaus heard a hundred times, cold and hard, the empty humor of speaking to a foolish child reflecting in his words. The same tune the man used upon locking him away from another three hours, mocking his fear of his powers.\n\n\nKlaus\u2019s knees buckle and with a gasp he sinks to the ground on his knees, gripping at his shirt. A mirthless laugh bursting forth from his lips.\n\n\nHe laughs and laughs until he cries, curling up on the floor with Reginald standing over him.\n\n\n\u201cFuck you.\u201d He sobs, breath catching in his throat. \u201cFuck you, seriously, fuck you!\u201d\n\n\nHis heart is bleeding, his lungs squeezing out the air and he can\u2019t breathe. Bitterness poisons his blood thicker than the drugs ever could, festering in his veins and bubbling to the surface like acid.\n\n\nHe can\u2019t breathe. Can\u2019t see through his blurry vision.\n\n\nHe\u2019s having a heart attack. \n\n\nThe shoes in front of him come closer.\n\n\n\u201cIf it is any consolation\u2014\u201d \n\n\nReginald\u2019s voice cuts through the fog inside his head, faint in his ears as black spots appear in front of his eyes. \n\n\n\u201c\u2014I never expected anything less from my children. Even you.\u201d \n\nKlaus awakens with a gasp and jolts upright.\nHe nearly headbutts Five, who lunges backwards with a yelp and Klaus hisses at the sharp throb of pain shooting through his skull and chest. He curls forward with another breathless gasp, one hand pressing against his chest only for hands to catch him.\nHe squeezes his eyes shut, sucking in a breath and coughs when it gets stuck in his throat.\n\u201cShit\u2014\u201d The voice says, thumping him lightly on the back. \u201c\u2014it\u2019s okay. Breathe, Klaus. Just breathe.\u201d\n\u201cGive me\u2026give me a moment.\u201d \u00a0\nKlaus blinks furiously to get his eyes to adjust to the dim-light of the coffee shop. His lungs are too small and his throat is too slippery for him to run his mouth, to get more words out and the hands on him grow bruising. He doesn\u2019t notice, his limbs tingling unpleasantly.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a whole fucking timeline.\u201d\nFive says, a little breathless next to his ear and the waver in his voice catches Klaus\u2019s attention. Raising his head to sneak a glimpse of his brother after his breathing grows steadier, he doesn\u2019t get the chance to get a good look at Five\u2019s face.\nA weight slams into him, latching onto him to keep him from falling backwards. Klaus startles, muscles going painfully tense before he realizes what\u2019s happening.\nOh. His mouth goes dry.\nFive is\u2026hugging him. One arm wrapped around his neck, the other around his upper back, crushing him to his body with such force Klaus can feel his lungs protest at the rough treatment. A chokehold more than a tearful embrace but he can\u2019t imagine Five giving hugs any other way.\nHis chest betrays him and he winces, a wheezing noise of pain passing through his lips.\nFive flings himself away like touching him burns.\nBut before the cold can sink back into his bones, there are small hands cradling his face, moving across his skin to check for injury and pulse and signs of life. Fingers press against his throat only to move down to his chest.\n\u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d\nFive demands, eyes wild and flickering from Klaus\u2019s face to his shirt. There\u2019s a urgency in his fumbling and hovering hands, an unspoken panic.\n\u201cIs it your chest? Let me look.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Klaus says, a bit bewildered but that was the wrong thing to say because Five goes deadly still, pausing in his attempts to pry Klaus\u2019s hands away from his chest and gives him a look.\n\u201cYou got shot in the fucking heart.\u201d\nFive twitches, a full body flinch at the words like he got hit by lightning, hands trembling where they where laying over Klaus\u2019s own, clammy with sweat and\u2026and blood. There was so much blood drenching the front of his shirt and Five\u2019s hands.\n\u201cYou were dead, Klaus.\u201d\nThe voice cracks and Klaus finally gets a good look at Five\u2019s face.\nAll the blood seems to have drained from his face, giving him an ashen pallor. Eyes bloodshot and red-rimmed, wide and glassy and furious as they remain on his chest with a focus Klaus has only seen him give the apocalypse. He\u2019s missing his jacket, the sleeve of his shirt shoved up to his elbows. His lips are a thin, bloodless line and his hands squeeze Klaus\u2019s, nails digging into his skin.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t come back from death. They don\u2019t. I checked, your pulse was gone, you\u2026you weren\u2019t breathing. For minutes. How did you come back?\u201d\nKlaus stammers for an answer, reeling at the visible show of fear on his brother\u2019s face.\nFive, a force of nature in the way he ruthlessly squashes his problems and deals with his enemies, who\u2019s crowd of ghosts is bigger than anything he\u2019s seen, is afraid.\nAnd it\u2019s Klaus\u2019s fault. For scaring him by dying in front of him.\n\u201cGod\u2026God doesn\u2019t like me very much.\u201d\nHe says in a rush, anything to get that look from Five\u2019s face.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Really, it\u2019s no big deal. Sure, it sucks and all but I don\u2019t stay dead. Not permanently, so you don\u2019t have to worry. Seriously, I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\u201cNo big deal?\u201d Five repeats, head snapping up to glare at him. \u201cYou died\u2014wait, hang on, how\u2026how do you know that?\u201d\nKlaus blinks. \u201cKnow what?\u201d He asks uneasily.\n\u201cThat you don\u2019t stay dead,\u201d\nFive\u2019s hands move to grip his chin when he tries to look away, jerking his head back as Five leans closer to stare into his eyes. Ready to pry the truth out with force if necessary.\n\u201cHow do you know? Have you died before? Did you die and keep it from us, from me?\u201d\nVoice thick with anger, Five\u2019s fingers dig into his jawbones. Dark eyes flashing with a ferocity suited for a predator, the grip is possessive, demanding and it shakes Klaus in a way his close call with death at the hands of Hazel and Cha Cha had.\nFive tightens his hold, squishing his cheeks. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no room for refusal, for disobedience in his tone and a shiver crawls up Klaus\u2019s spine, the alarm bells roaring to life in his head, to get away from the danger in front of him lest he ends up back with the little God and his prick of a Dad.\nHe\u2019s never felt afraid of his siblings despite their powers. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s not afraid of death that he can laugh in the face of their wrath, of their strength and shrug it off with a poor joke. Giggle himself silly over annoying them to their breaking point.\nHe\u2019s not afraid, not of Five, his brother, he\u2019s certain Five won\u2019t kill him but\u2014\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d\nFive snatches his hand back before he can finish his sentence.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Five\u2019s brows furrow, the concern casting a shadow over the anger. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my intention to\u2026I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\"\n\u201cI know,\u201d Klaus reassures him, giving him a weak smile and rubbing at his jaw. \u201cLike I said before, we\u2019ll get you a hobby for your anger issues, okay?\u201d\nIt\u2019s meant to be a joke, a crappy one but he misses his mark by a mile. Five deflates, jaw straining as he gives a sharp nod, not sniping back like Klaus expects him to.\nFuck.\nTaking the opportunity to peel his shirt collar away to glance at the wound, he sees a sluggish bleeding spot on his chest, but no bullet wound. It\u2019s a scrape, perhaps a small cut. Nothing to imply he\u2019d been shot.\nMom could fix that. Hell, he could fix it himself. Nobody would need to know.\n\u201cLook, Five, there\u2019s barely a wound anymore.\u201d\nHe pulls his crop top up to expose the wound, hearing Five suck in a breath before hands brush across the wound, careful and feather-light.\n\u201cAmazing.\u201d\nFloundering at the unexpected flattery, from Five of all people, Klaus hums in agreement and shoves down his shirt, leaning back on his hands and wincing at the tug in his chest that follows.\n\u201cCan we go home now?\u201d\nHe gestures to the empty caf\u00e9, ignoring the three corpses laying in a puddle of their own blood.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody here to get us another drink and\u2026and I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m dead beat, utterly exhausted and I\u2019ll sleep like a baby once we\u2019re home.\u201d\nFive gives him a smoldering scowl for his little pun and Klaus shrinks into himself. Dead jokes were a No go then. Good to know.\n\u201cCome here\u2014\u201d Five stands first, reaching out a hand to pull Klaus to his feet and steading him when he stumbles, knees shaking. He wraps an arm around his waist, letting him lean on his shoulders. \u201c\u2014I\u2019ll teleport us to the gate.\u201d\nWalking home while looking like a slaughter victim wouldn\u2019t be a good idea. Still, there\u2019s something that\u2019s been nagging at him.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your jacket?\u201d\nFive gives him an incredulous frown and inclines his head at behind them.\nCraning his neck to look over his shoulder, Klaus sees his brother\u2019s uniform jacket folded into a make-shift pillow on the floor. It\u2019s bloody but the sight of it makes something in his chest melt into a puddle of warmth.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we take it with us?\u201d\nThe police could use it to track them down and the last thing Diego needed was his former buddies at their doors, demanding answers about a suspicious child-sized jacket. Child service could be called and they\u2019d get into a fuck ton of trouble. Allison was trying to get custody of Claire and that would give her a disadvantage in court.\n\u201cLeave it,\u201d Five says sharply. \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d\nWell, he tried at least. With Five\u2019s vice grip around his waist there\u2019s nothing he could do.\n\u201cHold on tight.\u201d\nKlaus nods, and Five hands glow blue and they\u2019re standing in front of the Academy gate, leaning against each other for support.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you inside.\u201d\nFive guides him into the house to the living room couch and forces him to sit down. He vanishes from sight to return with a bowl of warm water, bandages, a towel and a new shirt and helps him out of his jacket and crop top.\n\u201cMy head hurts,\u201d\nKlaus mumbles in confusion about the headache he\u2019s sprouting as Five wipes away the blood from his chest and starts to clean the wound, dapping it softly in the cut, or small hole, really, to soak the towel and stop the bleeding.\nHe squints at Five. \u201cWhy does my head hurt?\u201d\n\u201cYou hit the counter on your way down.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d That makes sense. \u201cWhat, no joke about me losing brain cells, brother dear?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to crack jokes.\u201d Five gives him a tight smile.\nIt\u2019s not a nice smile. Klaus sinks deeper into the couch, wishing it would swallow him. A drink would be nice but something tells him if he asks Five to get him one, he\u2019ll find himself strapped to the infirmary table on infinite bedrest for the next two weeks.\nSo, he wisely keeps his mouth shut for once, wishing the odd feeling in his chest would fade. It throbs in pain when Five works on his wound but once he pulls his shirt on and they clean their hands, it\u2019s only an uncomfortable sensation of coldness making him ache.\nSmall hands pull his head down and cradle his head, running through his hair to feel for a bump and Klaus bites down on his tongue when Five presses down on a spot and his vision goes white.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d It\u2019s an unconscious apology Five mutters underneath his breath before he moves on, washing the blood out of his hair.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no wound here.\u201d\n\u201cYay,\u201d Klaus claps his hands together. \u201cWe\u2019re done now, right? I can go? To get my beauty sleep? I can hear my bed calling me and I would be a monster to ignore it, so I\u2019ll go and\u2014\u201d\nFive\u2019s hand grips his shoulder, keeping him from rising to his feet.\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d An order, not a request. \u201cIf I return and find you gone, Klaus, I\u2019m going to break your legs.\u201d\n\u201cA little dramatic don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u201cStay here,\u201d Five squeezes his shoulder in warning to stay put. \u201cAnd do not move.\u201d\nThe hand slips from his shoulder and in a flash of blue, Five vanishes, leaving Klaus sitting alone in the living room. Slumping into the couch, he leans sideway to throw his legs over the arm rest, throwing an arm over his eyes.\n\n\u201cYou promised.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot you too.\u201d\nKlaus whimpers at the sound of Ben\u2019s voice, not daring to look in fear of seeing the disappointed resignation on Ben\u2019s face.\n\u201cMy night\u2019s been an absolute nightmare so far and I\u2019d appreciate it if you could save the lecture and scolding and yelling for a time where I don\u2019t feel like my head\u2019s gonna explode if someone raises their voice at me.\u201d\nThere\u2019s an odd moment of silence until Klaus\u2019s feels the cold sink into his arm. Lowering it to sneak a glance, he sees Ben\u2019s face hovering over him.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeachy,\u201d Klaus grins, giving a thumbs up. \u201cAbsolutely fantastic. Never felt better, mi hermano.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\nKlaus makes a face.\nBen gently swats him on the arm, or tries to. It\u2019s not very successful without being corporal. Tough luck, Klaus doesn\u2019t have the energy, so he\u2019s stuck being an invisible little shit.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Klaus sighs, closing his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m back, ta-da! No need to make such a fuss.\u201d\nHe must look pathetic, downright horrible because Ben sighs but doesn\u2019t push the issues. No prodding for more information or tongue lashing like he\u2019s thirteen again and drinking himself through Daddy\u2019s bar in the middle of the night.\n\n\u201cI swear, I leave you alone for a few minutes and you get yourself into trouble. Five was supposed to keep an eye out for you.\u201d\n\nBen grumbles half-heartedly, but the bitterness lurking underneath his light-hearted words screams protectiveness. Ben, after years of watching Klaus go down the rabbit hole and do stupid, reckless shit, takes his job as a lookout for danger more serious than Luther did his self-proclaimed missions.\nIt\u2019s sweet and kind and just a tad bit annoying most of the times with Ben baring his teeth in a parody of the Horror at people who can\u2019t see him when Klaus gets himself into trouble.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it was mine. For leaving you alone.\u201d\n\nChrist on a cracker, not this again. Twisting his body on the couch to pout at Ben\u2019s sulking form standing guard next to him, he points at a spot on the floor and Ben sinks down to sit.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing this again. Nu-uh. I forbid it. Must I remind you that I\u2019m an adult? As much as I don\u2019t act like it and hate to remember my age, I\u2019m making my own choices even when most of them were shit. You\u2019re supposed to make me feel guilty over them, not the other way around.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\"\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Klaus put his hands over his ears. \u201cCan\u2019t hear you!\u201d\nBen flips him off.\n\u201cKlaus?\u201d A voice calls out, hurrying into the living room.\n\u201cGood morning, sis,\u201d He waves as Vanya paddles into the room in her pajamas, bleary with sleep. \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep? Want me to tell you a bedtime story or to sing you a lullaby?\u201d\n\u201cFive called a family meeting.\u201d She says, shifting on her feet. \u201cHe said it was an emergency.\u201d\nThat little snitch.\nForget trying to shield him from Ben\u2019s pettiness for the next few days. That tattle-tale isn\u2019t going to get a single drop of coffee for the next few weeks. He\u2019ll give Ben free reign to knock shit over to be a pain.\nOh, the betrayal. From his own brother no less! Klaus thought they were over this.\nApparently not.\nVanya is still staring at him with these worried eyes, biting at her bottom lip. She opens her mouth to ask over matters Klaus won\u2019t give her answers to, he\u2019d rather bite the bucket again than to make her cry and there\u2019s a very real possibility of her bringing down the house over such a trivial topic but she snaps it back shut when a shout echoes from the ceiling.\nA thud follows, then more shouting and Allison walks into the room, staring in amusement at the ceiling and settles into an armchair, legs drawn up and hair a fluffy mess.\n\u201cLooks like one of them didn\u2019t get up when Five asked them nicely to.\u201d\nShe muses, voice quiet. It\u2019s nothing more than a whisper, her throat straining with the effort to produce sounds. Yet, she\u2019s never sounded more beautiful with her raspy voice after the whole fiasco of having her neck nearly shredded to pieces.\n\u201cA shame really, because we all know Five doesn\u2019t ask nicely a second time.\u201d\n\u201cOr ever.\u201d Ben points out, eyebrows up to his hairline at the sound of a scream.\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet five dollars he kicked Diego out of his bed.\u201d Klaus says with glee, not bothering to sit up from where he\u2019s sprawled out across the couch.\n\u201cWhy would I bet against that?\u201d Allison shakes her head, gesturing for Vanya to sit down, which she does albeit reluctantly. \u201cIt\u2019s so obvious.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you have money to spare for your favorite brother?\u201d Klaus flutters his eyelashes at her, watching the smile tug at her lips.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Ben needs money.\u201d\n\u201cIs he here right now?\u201d Vanya\u2019s eyes stray across the room, passing over Ben.\n\u201cWhen isn\u2019t he?\u201d Klaus gestures to where Ben is sitting. \u201cHe sticks to me like gum to a shoe, not that I can blame him. I mean, have you looked at me?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Diego grumbles, storming into the room. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d\n\u201cSays the asshole who looks like he lost a fight to an alley cat.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off.\u201d\nAllison waves to get his attention as he plops onto the other armchair. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cLittle bastard kicked me out of my bed.\u201d Diego crosses his arms, fighting back a yawn.\nKlaus pumps a fist into the air, grimacing at stinging sensation in his chest. \u201cCalled it!\u201d\nLuther trudges into the room shirt dripping wet. They all pause to stare at him for a moment.\n\u201cFive.\u201d Is all he offers for an explanation and leans against the arm rest of Allison\u2019s arm chair.\n\u201cAnybody knows what\u2019s gotten into him?\u201d Diego asks, rubbing at his eyes.\n\u201cNo, no idea.\u201d Klaus stretches like a cat. \u201cProbably cranky because he missed his bedtime.\u201d\nLuther grunts. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s not another apocalypse.\u201d\nAllison jabs her elbow into his ribs and it does nothing but make him look like a kicked puppy. She rolls her eyes, points at Vanya\u2019s frown and he offers a quiet apology Vanya dismisses with a wave of her hand.\n\n\u201cYou know Five\u2019s gonna rat you out. Better speak up now before he drops the bomb on them and they\u2019ll start pointing fingers into your direction.\u201d\n\nKlaus hisses at Ben to shut up. His siblings share a glance but don\u2019t ask him to elaborate.\nAs if the call of his name summons him Five pops into the room, making everybody jump.\n\u201cIs that\u2026a blanket?\u201d Diego asks, dumbfounded at what Five\u2019s carrying in his arms.\n\u201cGood, you\u2019re still here.\u201d Five ignores them, marching over to tower over Klaus. \u201cHead up.\u201d\nHe shoves the pillow under his head, pushing him back down before gently tucking the blanket around him. Putting a hand on his forehead, Five clicks his tongue and disappears only to reappear with a glass of water in his hand.\n\"Drink up.\"\nKlaus takes the glass of water, eyeing it warily. \u201cDid you poison it?\u201d\n\u201cDrink it or I\u2019ll pry your mouth open and pour it down your throat.\u201d\nKlaus gulps down the water, setting the empty glass down on the floor. There\u2019s no itch breaking out across his skin, no stomach cramps. Just plain old boring water. His throat feels less dry, the sickening taste of blood lingering on his tongue.\n\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Ben peers at Five like he\u2019s never seen him before. \u201cDude, I think Five\u2019s trying to play nurse for you. How the hell did you die for him to tuck you into a blanket?\u201d\nThere\u2019s not a speck of blood on him. Probably changed into a fresh set of clothes to not raise alarm with the others. The blanket around Klaus feels more like a straightjacket but he doesn\u2019t dare comment on it.\n\u201cFive?\u201d Vanya\u2019s hesitant voice breaks the stunned silence. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve called this meeting since apparently, there are still some secrets that need to be brought to light. Because someone\u2014\u201d Five\u2019s eyes dart to him and Klaus pulls up the blankets to his nose. \u201c\u2014didn\u2019t find it necessary to tell us.\u201d\n\u201cOh, c\u2019mon!\u201d Klaus whines and throws up his hands into the air, forcing Five to step back if he doesn\u2019t want to get slapped. \u201cHow the fuck should that have come up in a conversation?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a point there.\u201d\n\nFive disagrees, bristling like a cat someone sprayed with water.\n\u201cYou should have said something, anything but to keep silent. This isn\u2019t something you can sweep under the rag.\u201d\n\u201cOh, so, what?\u201d Klaus pushes himself into a seating position. \u201cI was supposed to tell you so you could call me a liar? Like you did when I told you about Dad? Right, that would have gone super well \u201cOh brother dear, you won\u2019t guess what happened today!\u201d. What? You don\u2019t believe me? Oh darn, I have no proof, that\u2019s too bad.\u201d\nHe laughs, mean and harsh, curling into his blanket. \u201cJust let it go.\u201d He mumbles, feeling light-headed after his outburst.\n\u201cI\u2019m not letting it go.\u201d Five snarls, hands curling into fists and looking seconds away from tearing his own hair out. \u201cChrist, what the hell\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\n\u201cHold on, what the fuck is going on?\u201d Diego rises to his feet, glancing between them with furrowed brows. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Five sneers, lips curling into a sharp smile as he turns to face their siblings. \u201cTell them what happened or I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll give you one last chance to man up.\u201d\nBen\u2019s expression turns sour. \u201cI don\u2019t like that tone.\u201d\n\u201cMe neither.\u201d Klaus feels his chest tighten, wanting nothing more than to hide under the blanket. It\u2019s childish and wouldn\u2019t solve anything. Five would just tear it away and he\u2019d end up on the floor with a throbbing chest or give himself a concussion with his luck.\nHe doesn\u2019t understand Five\u2019s motive. What\u2019s the point of this?\nCha Cha and Hazel didn\u2019t get him this worked up, so why should it be different now? He\u2019s in better condition than after the torture session or the time travel stunt. Sure, he hated not knowing things, got downright scathing when someone withheld information, but it\u2019s not like Klaus did it for fun.\nIt just never came up and the first time it happened they wouldn\u2019t believe him about Reginald\u2019s suicide. The chances of them taking him seriously when he told them he died the previous night were laughably low. Them dismissing his death would have done him in for, so there was no reason to bring it up.\n\u201cFive, calm down.\u201d Luther steps forward, palms outstretched. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to shout. We can talk about this\u2014\"\n\u201cNo reason?\u201d Five echoes, voice low and tense like the strings of Vanya\u2019s violin. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to tell me to calm down, not after I thought I had to bury one of you again tonight!\u201d\nLuther stagers back, bracing himself on the arm chair with wide eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cRemember how you told me you guys are all I have left?\u201d\nFive starts pacing like an animal driven into a corner.\n\u201cFuck it, you were right. I came back for you all, to save you bunch of idiots from the apocalypse. I didn\u2019t give a fuck about the world. Your survival was my priority.\u201d\nVanya looks close to tears. \u201cFive\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2014\u201d Five rounds on Klaus. \u201c\u2014you got shot in the fucking heart in front of my eyes while I could do nothing but watch, you die and I have to pick out your blood from underneath my nails and then you have the audacity to tell me it\u2019s no big deal!\u201d\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d \u00a0Ben shouts, head whipping around to stare at Klaus like the rest of their siblings, their eyes growing wide with horror.\n\u201cBecause it isn\u2019t!\u201d\nKlaus shoves the blanket away, legs swinging over the couch to rise to his feet.\n\u201cLast time I checked nobody noticed and\u2026and it\u2019s not like I stayed dead! See?\u201d He pats himself up and down, voice rising as he laughs nervously. \u201cPerfectly fine! What\u2019s the point of telling you I died when it didn\u2019t stick? Huh? It changes nothing.\u201d\nFive\u2019s face flushes. \u201cStop saying that.\u201d He takes a threatening step forward. \u201cThat\u2019s the dumbest thing I\u2019ve heard you say.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d\nFor a moment he\u2019s sure Five will strike him. His eyes flash with the urge to hurt, to maim, to kill and there\u2019s a noise wrung from his chest similar to a growl. His right fist twitches, blood dripping down onto the floor from where his nails have pierced the skin and Klaus braces himself for the impact. For the flash of blue and the knuckles digging into his cheekbone.\nBut his fist doesn\u2019t land on Klaus\u2019s cheek, it slams into the wall instead.\nThe cracking noise of his fingers breaking rings out in the sudden silence and the floor they hadn\u2019t noticed started shaking goes perfectly still.\nKlaus falls back into the couch, chest throbbing fiercely and he rubs at the spot to ease the pain, lowering his head and bracing his arms on his knees.\n\u201cYou\u2026died?\u201d Allison sounds sick voicing the thought.\nNot having the strength to answer, he nods.\n\u201cTwice?\u201d Vanya croaks out, eyes flickering between dark and lighter colors.\nSlowly, antagonizing slowly, he gives another nod. Not bothering to think about the overdoses he had. They didn\u2019t count simply because God didn\u2019t come to visit him then.\nThe glass on the floor shatters as she takes in a deep breath. The moment she lets it out the uproar starts.\n\u201cHow? How did you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhen did you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck? Why didn\u2019t you\u2014\u201d\nTheir loud voices mesh together, a warped sound of static in his ears much like the ghosts with their wailing. Blending into one noise hammering against his skull, again and again and again\u2014\nHe puts a hand onto his forehead, clammy with cold sweat and moans.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Five\u2019s hiss silences them at once. \u201cYou\u2019re making his headache worse.\u201d\nThe couch sinks besides him as a weight settles down.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not the one who broke his hand in a fit of temper.\u201d Klaus rubs a hand over his face. \u201cThat line is getting old pretty fast, too. Try to think of something a little more original.\u201d\n\u201cAsk Ben.\u201d\nKlaus looks up to see Vanya\u2019s tears sliding down her face. The smile on her lips is brittle but the eerie glow from her eyes is gone. Panic twists in his stomach at her distress but he feels oddly numb, so he can\u2019t bother to cheer her up.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cAsk Ben to explain why we\u2019re upset.\u201d She says gently, wiping at her eyes.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d He turns to face Ben still sitting on the floor. \u201cEnlighten me, oh wise one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you feel when you saw me the first time like this?\u201d\n\nHorrible. Guilty. Mad with grief after the denial had worn off. But Ben knew that already. He didn\u2019t have to voice his answer.\n\n\u201cRight. I died and came back as a ghost.\u201d \n\nKlaus didn\u2019t get it. Ben curses under his breath, looking towards the ceiling as if to prey for patience as he reached out to lay a hand on his knee, hovering above it to avoid sticking his hand through Klaus\u2019s leg.\n\n\u201cIt still hurt, didn\u2019t it? To see me like this, to know I\u2019m here but not like before. You don\u2019t like it when I disappear. I\u2019m not permanently gone but the first few times I wandered off you cried like a baby, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \n\nHe did. Terror choked him at the thought of Ben leaving him alone, behind and forgotten. To never see him again, hear his voice and share his smile. Ben would come back. He always did but Klaus couldn\u2019t help but fear that this time he would be gone for good\u2014\nOh.\n\u201cFuck you, Benny, you don\u2019t get to use logic on me. Or this reverse psychology bullshit.\u201d\nShame prickles across his skin and Five nudges him in the side, letting Vanya fuss over his hand. Klaus tears his eyes away from Ben\u2019s dry but patient frown to see Diego crouching in front of him.\nWordlessly, Diego reaches out to take his hand, fingers wrapping around his wrist to feel his pulse.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry, Dee.\u201d He tries to tug his wrist free. \u201cGod doesn\u2019t like me very much so she won\u2019t let me stay.\u201d\n\u201cGod?\u201d Luther repeats, sounding faint.\n\u201cGood.\u201d Diego rubs circles with his thumb on his inner wrist, eyes earnest. \u201cBe sure to piss her off so she\u2019ll throw your ass out and back to us.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back,\u201d Klaus shakes his head, shoulders hunching forward. \u201cSure, it\u2019s quiet and there\u2019s a lack of ghosts but dear old Papa never fails to pay me a visit, the prick.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026you said you conjured Dad.\u201d Luther says, a little pale and swaying on his feet. \u201cConjured, not\u2026not met him in the afterlife\u2014\"\n\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t believe me then, big guy, strolling into the room to announce I met him in the afterlife sounded ridiculous even to me and that\u2019s saying something.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\nDiego looks ready to burst a blood vessel, glaring at the ceiling. His grip on Klaus\u2019s wrist went firm, ready to pull him away and sweep him out of the room in a firearm carry should Reginald manage to magically pop up behind the couch and despite them being the same height, Diego would have no problem with carrying him.\nHe\u2019s done it plenty of times.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear it, trust me.\u201d\nJust thinking about it set his blood boiling.\n\u201cGive it a shot.\u201d Diego squeezes his wrist encouragingly. \u201cC\u2019mon, you love gossip, bro.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe tomorrow.\u201d Klaus leans his head against the back of the couch, staring up at the grey ceiling. \u201cComing back to life isn\u2019t as easy as it looks.\u201d\nFive clears his throat.\n\u201cYeah, right, sorry. No joking about my death, got it. Big no-no.\u201d\nDiego\u2019s lips tug into a fond smile. \u201cLet\u2019s get you back to bed.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not moving.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cOne, I lost quite a bit of blood,\u201d Klaus ticks of the list with his fingers. \u201cTwo, the couch\u2019s ridiculously comfy and last but not least, my legs fell asleep and I don\u2019t wanna fall down the stairs. Not again.\u201d\nLuther walks over, shoving Diego to the side. \u201cI\u2019ll carry you.\u201d\n\u201cCareful, his chest isn\u2019t fully healed.\u201d\nFive warns as Luther scopes him up bridal-style like he weights nothing.\n\u201cReopen it and you\u2019ll wake up to a bucket of acid instead of water in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so getting these anger management classes, you little psycho. I\u2019ll even join a knitting group with you to get you to stay. Ohhh, it\u2019s gonna be great. All these old grannies itching to pinch your cute cheeks, unaware you\u2019re one of them.\u201d\nLuther keeps moving, carrying him out and up the stairs, Klaus as limp as a ragdoll in his arms.\n\u201cJust go to sleep, Klaus.\u201d\n\u201cSleep does sound nice.\u201d He yawns, eyes sliding shut.\nLuther tucks him into his bed, careful not to wake him and he lingers in the doorway, turning on the fairy lights hanging over his bed. The next morning Klaus wakes up to Grace fussing over his chest wound, checking him for a concussion and giving him a plate full of waffles.\nBen doesn\u2019t leave his side, sticking to him like glue and he does knock over Five\u2019s coffee once, much to his delight.\nWhat\u2019s strange is the new shadow trailing him, popping in and out of sight, light blue flashing in the corner of his eyes as he walks through the street and he lets Five do his thing, the watching and stalking for two days before he puts a stop to it because it\u2019s creepy and has too much of a serial killer vibe going for him to be okay with that.\nIt\u2019s even worse when he catches Diego trailing him one evening, awkwardly insisting he was doing a patrol round around the block to look for criminals.\nHe makes Ben visible; his blood turning blue with power and lets Ben do the talking about being a good babysitter. He actually manages to implant the fear of God in Diego, looming in close in his ninja get up and telling him The Horror will gut the next person who tries to kill a family member, doing so without batting an eye.\nDiego, who remembers sweet, quiet and shy Ben is naturally terrified.\nFive and Ben just have a staring contest for a few minutes, neither looking away before they both blink and nod at each other.\nFive doesn\u2019t attempt to follow him without asking permission to tag along first after that.\nBen looks surprisingly smug about the fact. Klaus lets him bask in his victory of\u2026of dominance and he hadn\u2019t thought anyone other than Diego and Luther would have a dick measuring contest but oh well. Ben\u2019s happy and when Ben is happy, there\u2019s no reason for Klaus to be sad, especially since he can pull the Ben card now, whenever Five is turning crazy serial killer on them.\nIt\u2019s hilarious, to see them backtrack so fast they nearly give themselves whiplash whenever Ben so much as turns to frown at them disapprovingly. They\u2019re not used to this side of Ben, his mood swings and jabs and the lack of hesitance on calling them all out on their bullshit.\nThey see Ben\u2019s death hanging over him, a reminder of his tragic backstory and bite their tongues in favor of sparing his feelings. Five is starting to grasp Ben\u2019s shameless use of exploiting his death to get his way, knowing he came to terms with his death years ago, but the sight of his brother is still too raw to escape the manipulations.\nThe best thing is Klaus doesn\u2019t have to do anything. No signals or code words. Ben turns all mother-hen on his own, demanding to be made visible, so he can stare Luther into submission whenever he toes out of line and into the shape Reginald tried to mold him into.\nWith Ben around, nobody can push him around. His siblings worry but there\u2019s still a distance, years that set them apart from Ben, who stuck around all this time, had taken his worst and saw the best in him.\nThey care but they\u2019re still learning. All they need is time.\nThank God Klaus has plenty of that."
