    "text": "The mirror is just starting to fog, steam creeping out from above the shower door and sticking to its surface, slowly obscuring the dull eyes that stare back at him. Buck pulls in a slow breath, watches as his ribs expand, tug at the stitches there and send little sparks of pain shooting through him. His skin is a burst of color\u2014midnight purples, hazy violets, all smeared together like a giant black hole right there on his side. It\u2019s beautiful, in the way that pain sometimes is.\nWhen the hot water hits his stitches, he can\u2019t help the sharp hiss that escapes him, stares up at the ceiling and lets the ache crash over him like a wave, lets it pull him under so he can open his eyes in the cool, sharp darkness of what\u2019s underneath. He sucks in another breath and imagines the burn of saltwater in his lungs. Imagines thousands of pounds bearing down on him, leg screaming, body pinned.\nTrapped.\nHe slams an open palm against the shower wall, lets the cool tile ground him as his chest heaves. C\u2019mon, Buckley. Get it together. He shakes his head, feels water drip down his face, across his lips, and reaches for the soap because there\u2019s nothing else he can do. He has to keep it together. He can\u2019t fall apart. Not again. He\u2019s already run out of second chances.\nSo he showers. He forces himself through the motions and the pain then steps out into a foggy bathroom and looks back in the mirror. He can hardly see himself anymore and, honestly, he doesn\u2019t want to, looks quickly away from his blurry reflection, throws on a patch of gauze and some comfortable clothes and crawls into bed. The night stretches long and unending before him.\n--\n(Two Days Earlier- Wednesday)\n\u201cBuck, Eddie, get inside and see if you can find anyone. We\u2019ve got at least two people unaccounted for on the third floor.\u201d\nBuck doesn\u2019t need to be told twice, hauls himself up onto the ladder and begins his ascent to the third story window they\u2019ve deemed most promising, adrenaline thrumming through his veins. It\u2019s his first major fire since being let back on the team and it feels like a milestone, feels like he\u2019s finally made it, like he\u2019s got a chance to prove to himself and everyone else what he\u2019s been saying all along\u2014that he\u2019s ready. That he can do this.\nHe smashes through the window and clears away all the glass, feels Eddie like a solid, unmoving presence at his back as he climbs into the building and stares out into the growing flames and billowing smoke. They\u2019ve got another team working to vent the roof and most of the building is already evacuated, the clock ticking as the walls seem to groan around them, fire licking at the ceiling overhead.\n\u201cLet\u2019s start checking the rooms,\u201d Eddie shouts over the roar of the fire.\nBuck nods and they start forward. They kick down doors and shout into heat and smoke and at first they get no response, just the sound of the fire and their own breaths echoed back in their masks. In the third office, they find a body. Eddie crouches to check for pulse but shakes his head, gives one last look at what once had been a vibrant life then pushes on. There might be someone still clinging to hope, might still be someone they can save.\nThey make it all the way around the floor and find nothing else. There\u2019s sweat dripping down his face, into his eyes, and the heat is almost unbearable even through his turnout gear. He knows they need to leave soon, and he nods to Eddie who grabs at his radio, asks Bobby if they\u2019ve got any more news on survivors.\nThere\u2019s still one unaccounted for, but the fire is getting too dangerous to have responders in the building.\n\u201cI want you guys out of there. We might be able to try again once the fire\u2019s under control.\u201d\nBuck clenches his jaw. If a survivor was hiding somewhere now, they wouldn\u2019t be alive by the time they came back later. There\u2019s one place left that they haven\u2019t tried and he knows it\u2019s a long shot, knows that Bobby had declared it off limits and too dangerous for their initial search.\nBut he goes anyway, ignores Eddie\u2019s shout behind him and pushes on, slams through the door to the staircase and shouts up into the spiraling cement.\n\u201cHello! Can anyone hear me?\u201d\nThere\u2019s only the roaring and whistling of the fire behind and below him and Buck swallows, feels his heart drop.\nThen a shoe lands at his feet. A light pink high heel that definitely hadn\u2019t been there before.\n\u201cHello!\u201d he shouts.\nHe runs up the first flight of stairs, ears straining for an answer. He hears Eddie\u2019s boots not far behind and almost lets out a whoop of excitement when he spots her, a middle aged woman slumped against the stairs, staring up at them with wide, panicked eyes.\n\u201cHello ma\u2019am,\u201d he says, trying to sound as calm as possible. \u201cWe\u2019re with LAFD and we\u2019re going to get you out of here.\u201d\nBuck crouches beside her while Eddie radios Bobby, only has a moment to register Bobby\u2019s frantic shout of Get out of there immediately before he hears something groan and snap overhead.\nBurning debris drops onto the stairs above them and Buck scoops the lady over his shoulders, takes off behind Eddie like a bat out of hell. The ladder truck is now the light at the end of a hazy, burning tunnel.\nThey\u2019re almost there when another groan overhead has Buck grinding to a halt, just barely jumping out of the way in time for some of the ceiling to give way and send fresh plumes of smoke billowing down into the hallway. He gestures to Eddie on the other side of the debris, motions for him to take the woman since there\u2019s no way he can climb over that with her still across his shoulders.\nThey transfer her carefully and Buck grins at Eddie\u2019s tense expression.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d\nThey both know Eddie can\u2019t linger, not with the civilian exposed to the heat and smoke of the fire. So Eddie runs and Buck watches him for just a moment, allows himself that small second of reprieve before hauling himself over the smoking planks and carpeting. He can see Eddie at the window, handing the woman over to someone else waiting on the outside, and he\u2019ll blame that distraction and his own lack of discipline for what happens next.\nAnother bit of ceiling falls directly on his back and he\u2019s not prepared, hits the floor hard enough that a grunt of air is forced from his lungs. It feels like he\u2019s been tackled by a linebacker, but when he hauls himself back up he sees it was part of a beam, swung down like a pendulum and fortunate enough to have missed his head. But also unlucky enough to have hit him at all.\nHis back aches, but there\u2019s a sharper pain in his side that\u2019s harder to ignore. With the woman taken care of, Eddie turns and catches Buck\u2019s eyes, worry plane on his features even through the mask and smoke. Buck forces himself to jog, gets to the window and gives Eddie a clap on the shoulder while his side screams with every movement.\nThe rest of the call passes in a strangely focused blur of moments, bright kaleidoscope pieces all running together.\nThe get down off the truck. Bobby gives him a rundown on following orders. Then, he squeezes his shoulder, nods to where the woman is getting loaded into an ambulance and rushed away.\n\u201cThey think she\u2019s going to make it.\u201d\nHen asks if he\u2019s okay and he waves her off. There\u2019s so much adrenaline running through his veins and he\u2019s done it. He\u2019s saved someone. He\u2019s back.\u00a0He can\u2019t risk all that for some small injury. Surely it\u2019s not bad enough to be concerned, if he\u2019s walking and talking and no one has noticed blood seeping through his clothes.\n(A small, smarter part of his brain whispers that that\u2019s not enough, but is quickly silenced.)\nThe fire is eventually smothered into smoke and quiet smoldering. The heat and noise and flickering light disappears, replaced by the flashing of emergency vehicles and the ever-present drone of first responders crawling across the site like worker bees.\nHe helps when he can, gets back on the truck when he\u2019s told, and by the time they make it back to the firehouse it\u2019s an hour past the end of his shift and he\u2019s more than ready to go home. His back and side ache and he knows, he knows,\u00a0he\u2019s at least a little hurt. Probably hurt enough to be benched for a few days.\nBut he can\u2019t take it. He can\u2019t.\nHe\u2014\nHe\u2019ll only be benched if someone knows.\nSo he takes off his turnout gear and leaves on his shirt, biting back sounds and keeping his face carefully blank as his body screams at him to stop.\u00a0He gets dressed. He waves goodbye to everyone else and gets in his car.\nHe goes home.\nBy the time he stumbles through the door, both his shirts are soaked through with blood and he knows even before he strips them off that he\u2019s not going to like what he finds underneath. He has the first aid kit ready on the bathroom counter, sterile wipes, needle, and thread staring back at him like a horrible taunt.\n\nFirst chance back and this is what you\u2019ve got?\n\n\nHow many times are you going to mess it up, Buckley?\n\n\nYou\u2019re out of chances.\n\n\nThey\u2019re going to be so disappointed when they find out. \n\nWell they\u2019re never going to find out.\nHe sews himself back together and cleans himself off as best he can, collapses onto his bed and doesn\u2019t even bother getting beneath the covers before sleep takes him, dark and cold and empty as the sea, where the crackling heat of fire can never reach.\n--\n(Present- Sunday)\nHe shows up for his shift with a fire burning in his gut. He\u2019d made it this far, made it through that first major call, through his first shift back two days later. Now he\u2019s got twenty-four hours to pretend he\u2019s fine. Twenty-four hours to paste on a smile and hide the crooked line of stitches on his side, to hide the bruising that surrounds it like a collapsing star, to hide the purple creeping just above the back collar of his shirt.\nThat, at least, he\u2019s not so afraid so show. A little bruising here and there isn\u2019t uncommon in their line of work and so long as no one questions how far down it goes, how nasty and dark it looks at its center\u2026\nHe\u2019ll be fine.\nHe is fine.\nAnd he\u2019s got a whole twenty-four hours to prove it.\nThe first challenge comes by way of Bobby, walking up to him with a little crease between his brows.\n\u201cHey, saw you needed your turnout jacket sent in for some repairs. When did that happen?\u201d\nBuck smiles, shrugs. \u201cProbably that last fire, debris falling all over the place, had to run for a bit at the end with that woman across my shoulders\u2026 Something must\u2019ve caught it, tore.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t feel anything? It didn\u2019t all the way through?\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d he grins a little wider, holds out his arms. \u201cNot a scratch. Maybe I\u2019ve finally run out of all that bad luck.\u201d\nBobby shakes his head, but there\u2019s a small smile creeping in at the corners of his mouth. \u201cAlright, well let\u2019s not push it.\u201d\nAnd honestly, Buck agrees. He\u2019s already determined to be as careful as possible for the next month. He\u2019s worked too hard to lose it all now.\nHe\u2019d fought and nearly lost everything. Like hell was he going to go through that again. Like hell was he going to waste it.\nSo he keeps his head down, goes out on calls and tries to play it safe, looks a bit more before he leaps. Thankfully, there\u2019s no more burning buildings to run into, just a couple trapped in an elevator, a few traffic accidents, and a father convinced his daughter was dying when she just had a bad case of the flu.\nThen suddenly he\u2019s eighteen hours in and staring at himself in the bathroom mirror, face pale as he bites the inside of his cheek. There are a few beads of sweat on his forehead and pads of dirtied gauze in a bag in his pocket.\nThe door swings open and he splashes water on his face, tries to look natural as he grins and squints through one eye at whoever walked in.\nIt\u2019s Eddie, because of course it is, and Buck forces himself to stand a little straighter, to make sure his veneer is shining even more brightly than usual.\n\u201cHey, man.\u201d\n\u201cHey.\u201d Eddie chuckles and steps closer, meets Buck\u2019s eyes in the mirror. \u201cHaving trouble staying awake?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Buck sighs, then grins and turns to look at Eddie head on. \u201cThink there\u2019s any coffee left in the kitchen?\u201d\nEddie shakes his head. \u201cI think you need a napmore than you need caffeine.\u201d\nAnd god isn\u2019t that the truth. He wants nothing more than to crawl into bed and sleep for a week. But he can\u2019t. Can\u2019t let his guard down. Can\u2019t give anyone any reason to suspect something\u2019s wrong.\nSo he laughs, and bumps Eddie\u2019s shoulder, and walks out the door before those kind hazel eyes can flay him any deeper.\nIt\u2019s a small mercy that they don\u2019t get any crazy calls before the end of his shift. A full twenty-four hours without anything earth shattering. It feels like a miracle and Buck is ready to kiss whatever deity he has to when he hears someone let out a low whistle in the locker room behind him and his stomach drops.\n\u201cDamn, Buck, what happened to your back?\u201d\nHe sees Eddie freeze out of the corner of his eye and makes sure to keep his motions calm and fluid, pulls on his jacket so the collar obscures the faint traces of bruising creeping up his spine.\n\u201cProbably a piece of ceiling. Looks pretty cool, right?\u201d\nChim lifts a brow. \u201cIf by cool you mean incredibly painful.\u201d\nSomething cold drips down Buck\u2019s throat, settles sour and thick in his stomach. He forces a laugh. \u201cNah man, I'm fine. Didn\u2019t even notice until I saw it in the mirror a couple days ago.\u201d\nChim doesn\u2019t look convinced and he can see Eddie creeping closer, looking worried and frustrated in equal parts. It feels like the walls are closing in. Feels like everything is slipping through his fingers.\nHe can\u2019t do it again. He can\u2019t.\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll see you guys later, yeah?\u201d\nHe shuts his locker and walks away, doesn\u2019t stop until he\u2019s in his car and half way home. Until it finally feels like he can breathe again.\nHe dreams of salt water and deafening explosions, wakes up on a choked scream with blood on his shirt. He sits with his head between his knees, rocks back and forth and tries to hold himself together. I\u2019m okay.\nHe has to be.\n--\nHe wakes up the next morning to a text from Eddie. His eyes are red and he knows the dark circles have only gotten worse. His throat is sore and his side throbs with every beat of his heart, makes him groan when he sits up and throws his legs over the side of the bed. Everything is stiff and painful and he knows he\u2019s been pushing it, even taking it easy at work is still too much, but he can\u2019t ask for time off because then they\u2019ll be questions and he can\u2019t answer them. Can\u2019t risk it. Can\u2019t\u2014\nHe unlocks his phone and opens the message from Eddie, feels a strange twist in his chest at the invitation to come over and have dinner with them in the evening. Normally, he would say yes without a second thought. Normally, he wasn\u2019t trying to hide something from his best friend.\nHe swallows and replies, decides not going would be more suspicious than whatever Eddie might try and ask while he\u2019s over. Besides, seeing Christopher will be medicine in and of itself. Seeing the little guy always managed to brighten his day, no matter what else was going on in his life.\nIt doesn\u2019t make it any easier when he\u2019s standing at the door, covered in a t-shirt and dark button up with a collar, wondering if he\u2019s made the right choice. A part of him still wants to turn and run, wants to curl up in a ball and hide all the soft, vulnerable parts of himself until it finally feels like he\u2019s not shaking apart.\nHe thinks of everything he has to lose. His job. His life. His family.\nBecause as much as they may love him now, he knows how this story goes. Time is a slow and merciless killer and maybe they would stay in touch for the first month or two, then it would be less and less, until finally it was only the occasional phone call or message promising a meet up that would never come. Buck knows he\u2019s not enough to make someone stick around. And he\u2019s definitely not enough to have someone coming back.\nHe needs this job as much as he needs his family because it is his family. It\u2019s what keeps them together.\nAnd as much as Buck feels himself drawn to the warmth of the house before him, as much as he wants to hold Christopher and see Eddie smile in that soft, secret way he has when he thinks no one\u2019s looking, he\u2019s very aware that these boys hold the keys to his heart. That if anyone would make him crack open and spill out across the floor it\u2019s them.\nHis heart beats louder in his chest.\nBut he\u2019s fine. He\u2019s fine.\nHe knocks on the door.\nHe hears Christopher shout from inside and the faint clacking of his crutches against the hardwood. The door opens moments later and he has a big smile already on his face that\u2019s only a little forced, becomes genuine the moment he kneels down and has Christopher crashing into his chest, arms wrapping around his neck in a hug. The pain is nothing compared to the pure joy that radiates through him.\n\u201cHey, buddy.\u201d\n\u201cHey, Buck.\u201d\nHe looks up and sees Eddie watching him quietly. Him, not them, and Buck immediately feels the need to perform.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he asks, giving Chris a mischievous smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan for tonight? Games? Movies? Making a mess of your dad\u2019s kitchen?\u201d\nChris laughs and Buck tickles his sides, gives him one last squeeze before standing up.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really have a plan,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cI ordered some food that should be here soon. Otherwise, it\u2019s whatever the two of you want to do.\u201d\nBuck looks back down at Chris and puts a hand on his head, hair soft beneath his palm. \u201cHear that? Whatever we want.\u201d\n\u201cPillow fort!\u201d Christopher crows, already hurrying to the living room. \u201cAnd ice cream!\u201d comes around the corner just a few moments later.\nEddie lets out a laugh. \u201cAt least he\u2019s easy to please.\u201d\n\u201cThe kid has good taste.\u201d Buck grins in agreement.\nEddie looks at him for a beat, eyes full of something Buck can\u2019t quite place. \u201cYeah, he does.\u201d\nIt feels like he\u2019s saying something different and Buck swallows, shifts on his feet and tries not to glance down at Eddie\u2019s lips, or his chest, or the outline of his strong arms in the Henley he\u2019s wearing. He fails miserably at all of those things and when he meets Eddie\u2019s eyes again he finds that they\u2019re warm and unbearably fond, crinkling at the corners with quiet laughter.\nA flush colors his cheeks at getting caught, but he\u2019s saved by the ringing of the doorbell. He makes his escape into the living room while Eddie grabs the food. In no time at all, they\u2019ve got a bunch of pillows and blankets stacked and draped around the room, forcing Buck and Eddie to hutch over as they eat Thai food from some place a few streets over.\nThey end up playing a few card games then putting an animal documentary on Netflix, Christopher curious to learn about real life lions after the CGI versions Disney had given him in theaters. It\u2019s a great night and honestly just what Buck needed. It feels like a reminder of what he\u2019s fighting for and with Chris asleep against his side and Eddie\u2019s leg a warm weight against his own, he can\u2019t think of a single place he\u2019d rather be.\nWhen the documentary ends, Eddie quietly stands and starts taking down the fort, giving Buck enough room to stand with Christopher in his arms. His stitches pull a bit and he can\u2019t quite cover the wince\u2014if the way Eddie\u2019s mouth pulls into a frown is any indication, but he soldiers on, readjusts Chris and carries him all the way into his room despite the uncomfortable pressure it puts on his bruising.\nEddie steps up to give Chris a kiss goodnight and Buck disappears into the hall and back into the living room, starts cleaning up the rest of the mess in the hopes that he can do most of the bending and lifting before Eddie is there to watch him struggle through it. He\u2019s only partially successful and he\u2019s thankfully hidden behind the closet door when he puts a few blankets away and grimaces at the way his stitches pull, hears Eddie coming closer and quickly schools his features.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to help clean, Buck.\u201d\n\u201cYou tell me that every time.\u201d Buck steps back so Eddie can shove a few more blankets into the higher shelves. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t stopped me yet.\u201d\nEddie just sighs and puts a hand on his shoulder, looks him in the eye in a way that has Buck going a bit fuzzy at the edges.\n\u201cThank you. For everything.\u201d\nAnd yeah, Buck thinks, definitely worth it. Even though he\u2019s sore all over and most likely bleeding again, he wouldn\u2019t change it for the world, not when Eddie is looking at him like that, so warm and soft and open. He lets that feeling carry him all the way home, clings to it as he cleans himself up and stares at himself in the mirror, wonders what tomorrow will bring.\n--\nAnother shift goes by, and another, and Buck is keeping his head above water. He\u2019s still sore, and his stiches are healing slow and crooked, but he\u2019s okay. He\u2019s okay despite the dark circles under his eyes and the paleness of his skin. Despite the few pounds he\u2019s dropped in the last couple weeks.\nHe looks a bit sick, if he\u2019s honest and a few people have noticed.\nDidn\u2019t sleep well last night, he says.\nJust tired, he says.\nJust a cold, he says.\nHe throws excuse after excuse and lets out a sigh of relief when each one sticks. There had been a few more comments about the bruising on his back, but even those have faded as he continued to shrug each one off and as the deep purple faded from a hazy blue to a sickly green. Now it\u2019s mostly comments about him not being in the gym, or not eating as much at meals. He chalks them both up to the mysterious cold/fatigue that\u2019s been hanging around and privately reassures himself that he\u2019s doing the right thing. The gym would be pushing it too much. And the food\u2026 he\u2019s just not that hungry.\nHe\u2019ll put the weight back on when he\u2019s healed up, isn\u2019t too worried about it so long as he can still do his job, which he can. He\u2019s long since learned to push through pain.\nHe\u2019s a few hours into a Tuesday shift when everything goes to shit and that\u2019s probably not why he\u2019s expecting it. It\u2019s a Tuesday. Nothing ever happens on Tuesdays. But there\u2019s a building burning and they\u2019re rushing to the scene, sirens blaring and a residential home going up in smoke.\nNormally, a call to a fire in a residential home on a weekday wouldn\u2019t be too much of a crisis. Property damage? Sure. But residents would be out at school or work. This home, however, is apparently host to a group of homeschool kids who are all scattered and trapped throughout the house by age group. Some of them are already out, standing around their teacher with wide eyes as fire licks at the roof.\nBobby gives out orders and Buck is on the move, running through the house and grabbing kid after kid, rushing them through the smoky hallways to Hen and Chim waiting just outside. Eddie is searching the basement as Buck finishes clearing the first floor and thunders up the stairs to the second, knocking on doors and shouting LAFD. The second floor is a mess of fire and smoke and there\u2019s no way he can get anyone back down the stairs before the fire is more under control. He radios down to Bobby and prays there\u2019s somewhere to get a ladder.\nHe\u2019s told there are at least five kids upstairs, between ten and thirteen, and he finds all of them huddled together in the bathroom while flames roar just outside the door. They scream when he first rushes in and he\u2019s immediately trying to calm them, rooting in the cabinets for towels to hold over their faces and radioing Bobby for retrieval.\n\u201cThe bathroom window is too small. We\u2019ll have to try a different route.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have a clear path anywhere?\u201d\nBuck steps back out into the hallway and looks around, pushes open the door to the next room and finds it mostly in tact and with a large window facing the front yard.\n\u201cNext room looks good, Bobby. Can you get a ladder up to me?\u201d\nHe waves from the window and gets a thumbs-up from Bobby, opens the window and pushes out the screen while the truck gets pulled into position. Then he goes back for the kids.\nThey stare at him as shocked and soot-faced as before, and he knows he\u2019s running out of time, always running out of time. He grabs the first kid and runs, passes them through the window into Bobby\u2019s waiting arms and goes back for the next and the next. His side is screaming and he swallows down a grunt of pain as he picks up the next one, has to bite back a scream when the kid panics as he\u2019s being passed through the window and flails, kicks Buck in the side in a way he\u2019s sure has fresh blood staining his shirt.\nThe last kid is passed out when he gets there, whether from shock or smoke inhalation, and Buck remembers the determined look on the girl\u2019s face as she\u2019d insisted the others go first because she was oldest and it was her responsibility to make sure they were safe. He picks her up as carefully as he can and runs, gets her to the window where Eddie is now positioned and waiting.\nAs soon as she\u2019s out of his arms, he\u2019s radioing down to Bobby.\n\u201cLast one out, but she\u2019s unconscious.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have Hen waiting.\u201d\nThe response does something to calm his nerves and there\u2019s nothing for him to do but follow Eddie down, maneuvering himself out the window and using each step down as a chance to fortify himself, push the pain down so no one else can see it.\nEddie meets him at the bottom, his own face smudged with ash and sweat but somehow managing to look worried about what he finds on Buck\u2019s.\n\u201cYou okay, man?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Buck pants, pulling off his mask. \u201cI\u2019m fine. You?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good.\u201d He stares at Buck for another moment, only turning away when Bobby calls their names and tasks them with hose duty now that everyone\u2019s been evacuated from the house.\nHauling and maneuvering the heavy lines ruins whatever was left of his stitches and it feels like a fire is burning just beneath his skin as the minutes tick by, the pain dissolving to a prickling buzz throughout his entire body. By the time he collapses in the truck, it feels like he can hardly think straight, just tries to focus on taking deep, even breaths and stopping his hands from shaking.\nIt hurts so bad. \nFeels like the lingering agony of physical therapy after his leg.\nFeels like the bone-deep exhaustion of wandering the streets after the tsunami.\nFeels like he\u2019s about to be swallowed up again, about to lose his tenuous grip on everything and everyone he\u2019s fought so hard to get back to. He digs his fingers in and holds on.\nHe\u2019s okay.\nHe forces himself through the motions of the rest of his shift, has to patch himself up in the bathroom as best he can, shower smoke and ash and blood from his skin then cover it all up and come back out smiling. Because he has to be perfect.\nHe has to prove that he\u2019s where he\u2019s supposed to be.\nHe watches TV and helps some guy who\u2019s got his dick stuck in a vacuum. Sits through dinner and forces himself to swallow food that he doesn\u2019t want to eat.\nHe\u2019s okay.\nBut Chim and Hen keep exchanging glances and Bobby is watching him out of the corner of his eye and Eddie is hovering and they just won\u2019t let it go. As soon as his shift ends he\u2019s off like a rocket, bolting to the locker room before anyone can stop him. Of course, that means Bobby is already there waiting.\nHe gives Buck one long, hard look and lifts a brow. \u201cYou want to tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d\nBuck shrugs, makes his way past to his locker. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cBuck.\u201d His voice is a warning just as much as the hand on his shoulder.\nBuck takes a deep breath, forces a smile as he turns back around. \u201cI\u2019m just tired, okay? It\u2019s been a long couple weeks and that call today took a lot out of me. But I\u2019m fine.\u201d\nBobby still doesn\u2019t look convinced, is looking at Buck like he\u2019s one small push away from breaking. Is looking at him like he was that day at the hospital, after the blood clots. It makes something go tight in Buck\u2019s chest, makes his whole world tip a little bit sideways and his ears ring like the rising scream of a bell.\n\u201cIf you need a day off\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head, stuffs his things into his bag and turns away to hide the way his hands are shaking as he unbuttons his shirt. He throws his jacket on a little too quickly and sucks in a breath at the way pain shoots through his side. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cAlright. Call me if you need anything, okay?\u201d\nBuck hears the words but they don\u2019t really register. He\u2019s too focused on getting out. There\u2019s a sucking weight in his chest and he feels like he\u2019s losing his grip, breaths coming short and tight as he gets into his car and works his way through traffic. His eyes burn and his throat clicks, but he holds it together. Holds it together until he\u2019s pushing through his door, locking it and collapsing against the solid wood, letting it hold him as he falls apart.\nHe lets the tears come, lets them burn at the corners of his eyes and clog up his throat until he\u2019s sobbing, loud and ugly because everything hurts and he can\u2019t do anything about it, can\u2019t seem to stop the universe from tearing everything away.\nHe\u2019s not sure how long he sits there, but long enough that when he finally stands he feels a little lightheaded, floaty in the way you do after a really long cry. The sky is darkening outside the windows and he makes his way slowly up the stairs and into the bathroom, strips off his shirt and just sits on the toilet lid, uncaring and unfeeling of the ragged tear in his chest as he stares down at the tile floor.\nHe\u2019s so tired. All he wants is to crawl into bed.\nA single drop of blood snakes its way down his chest and he watches as it soaks into his waistband, lifts up shaky hands and wonders when he became such a mess.\nIt\u2019s okay.\nHe thinks it like a mantra, clenches and unclenches his hands until the trembling stops then carefully sews himself back together, covers the ragged line with another piece of gauze and a whole lot of denial. The bruising is a little harder to ignore, fading but still a wash of glaring color against his otherwise pale skin. He refuses to look at himself in the mirror as he walks by.\nHe leaves his shirt and jacket lying on the floor and opens the bathroom door with one thought in mind: sleep. Possibly shitty and un-restful sleep, but a brief escape from the pain nonetheless.\nHe\u2019s not expecting Eddie to be standing there on the other side, arms across his chest and a hard glint in his eye that immediately dissolves into concern as he catches sight of Buck.\n\u201cWhat in the\u2014hey!\u201d\nEddie calls out and plants a hand on the bathroom door, stopping Buck from slamming it closed again.\nBuck tries to push it shut, but he\u2019s tired and in pain and honestly no match for all of Eddie\u2019s well meaning determination. He watches as if outside his own body, arms crossed over his chest as his last form of defense, as Eddie shoulders his way inside, waits for whatever yelling is sure to follow.\nBut he doesn\u2019t get yelling. Instead, he gets Eddie stepping closer, lifting one gentle hand that doesn\u2019t even touch his skin.\n\u201cBuck, what is this?\u201d His voice sounds so soft and small that Buck has to turn away, can\u2019t face whatever\u2019s in Eddie\u2019s eyes that\u2019s making him sound that way.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\nEddie makes a frustrated sound. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously something. When did you get hurt?\u201d\nEddie reaches out and this time he does touch him, wraps one hand around Buck\u2019s wrist and pulls his arm away, holds it to the side as he does the same to the other, his palms warm and grounding as he keeps Buck open and exposed, takes in the bruising on his side, the pad of gauze taped hastily just beneath his pec.\nBuck\u2019s breaths come quicker and he backs away until he hits the counter, can only stare unseeingly at the shower as Eddie presses right up against him, lets go of one wrist to gently remove the gauze on his chest.\nEddie sucks in a breath at what he sees, fingers skimming the outline of the wound. \u201cOh, Buck.\u201d\nAnd Buck feels tears pricking at his eyes again, feels everything bubbling up and threatening to spill over, threatening to leave him a sobbing mess on the floor when he can\u2019t\u2014he can\u2019t. \nHe shakes his head and tries to worm away, is stopped by Eddie\u2019s firm weight pressing him into the counter.\n\u201cBuck, please. Talk to me.\u201d The fingers at his chest skim up to his neck, then slide back and cup his jaw, the sweep of Eddie\u2019s thumb coaxing Buck to turn and face him. \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d\nBuck just shakes his head again, tries to blink back tears and restarts his mantra. It\u2019s okay.\n\nIt\u2019s okay.\n\nEddie sighs and drops Buck\u2019s other wrist in favor of holding his waist, coaxing him to the side so he can sit him down on the toilet seat. Then that same hand is in Buck\u2019s hair, gently scratching at his scalp, guiding Buck\u2019s forehead to rest at the soft, warm fabric just above his stomach.\n\u201cIt looks too old to be from today,\u201d Eddie says. His fingers briefly skim over the top of Buck\u2019s spine, then trace further down, following the line of bruising that goes from just above his shoulders, across one shoulder blade, and to the center of his back. \u201cYou told Chim this was from the fire two weeks ago. You also brushed it off like it was nothing. This isn\u2019t nothing, Buck.\u201d\nBut Eddie doesn\u2019t understand, doesn\u2019t understand that it has to be nothing, because if it\u2019s something then\u2026 Well, then Buck\u00a0is nothing, stripped of everything that makes him who he is.\nMakes everything he fought for was a waste.\nHe crosses his arms loosely over his stomach, hands clenching and unclenching at his sides. It\u2019s not enough to hold him together but god is he going to try.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\nIt\u2019s muffled in the fabric of Eddie\u2019s shirt, but it\u2019s obvious the other man hears him with the way he sighs and holds Buck that little bit tighter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay not to be fine, you know.\u201d\nBuck lets those words die in the air between them, takes a deep breath and sits up just enough to look Eddie in the eyes. \u201cPlease don't tell Bobby.\u201d Eddie\u2019s face goes through an interesting range of emotions but Buck pushes on. \u201cI\u2019ve got a couple days before my next shift and I promise I\u2019ll take it easy. I\u2019ll be fine. So please, you can\u2019t tell him. I\u2014\u201d\nThe words stick in his throat and his eyes burn. It\u2019s all wrong. Eddie shouldn\u2019t be here. He shouldn\u2019t\u2014Buck just needs five minutes to get himself cleaned up. Then he can prove it. He can prove he\u2019s fine and promise Eddie whatever he needs to get him to believe it.\nHe stands up suddenly, dislodging Eddie\u2019s hands and pushing past him to get to the sink. The first aid kid is still sitting on the counter and he opens it quickly, pulls out a fresh pad of gauze and some tape and resolutely doesn\u2019t look up at his reflection in the mirror. He\u2019s fine. He\u2019s fine.\n\nIt\u2019s okay.\n\nEddie steps up behind him and he shudders at the sudden warmth all along his back, wants nothing more than to lean into it and let Eddie take some of his weight. He doesn\u2019t realize his hands are shaking until Eddie\u2019s fingers trace carefully down his forearms, skate over his wrists and slot gently between Buck\u2019s own.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got you, Buck. You\u2019re okay.\u201d\nBuck glances up to meet Eddie\u2019s eyes in the mirror and it\u2019s a mistake. Because it\u2019s his own eyes that grab him and don\u2019t let go, blue and lifeless, ringed with red and weighted down by ever deepening purple. He\u2019s so tired.\nGod, he\u2019s a mess.\nThe gauze and tape drop to the counter and a sob escapes his throat, leaves him breathless as Eddie wraps their arms around his chest, one set of hands on his shoulder and another just beneath the ragged stitches at his side. He holds Buck tight, keeps him from shaking apart as the tears keep coming, as the next wave crashes over his head.\nHe\u2019s not okay, he\u2019s so far from okay, because for as long as he can remember the ground hasn\u2019t felt solid beneath his feet. His life, his family, keeps slipping through his grasp. He told Bobby he\u2019s a fighter, and he is, god he\u2019s been fighting his whole life it feels like. But he just\u2014he just keeps fucking it up.\n\nAlways a disappointment.\n\nHis tears stop as a numbness washes over him. He looks at his reflection, takes in the puffy eyes and flushed cheeks, the wetness clinging to his lashes, as if from somewhere far away. When Eddie shifts behind him, Buck feels it like an echo against his skin, stares into nothing and lets Eddie turn him, lets himself be lifted up onto the counter.\nA warm palm cups his cheek.\n\u201cBuck?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a ringing in his ears again, low but persistent.\n\u201cEvan?\u201d\nHis breath hitches and Eddie rubs a gentle circle against his cheek.\n\u201cI need you to come back. I don\u2019t know where you are right now, but I need you here. With me. Can you do that?\u201d\nBuck pulls in another shuddering breath, wants to scream no, wants to shake his head and pull Eddie closer and drown in the darkness of his own mind and Eddie\u2019s warm arms. But it\u2019s like the connection between his brain and the rest of his body is broken, leaves him sitting there like a shell while worry creases deeper and deeper into Eddie\u2019s brow.\nThe hand on his cheek drops, lands at the junction of his neck and shoulder and squeezes just tight enough to start breaking through the fog. Heat. Pressure. Then another hand presses against his side, rubs up and down a few times before slipping around to his back and pulling him in. His forehead hits somewhere along Eddie\u2019s collarbone and the next breath he takes leaves him dizzy.\nEddie is safe and solid and warm and Buck turns his head to burrow further in, is quietly pleased when Eddie steps closer and lets Buck nuzzle into the side of his neck. Eddie\u2019s skin is perfect against Buck\u2019s forehead, the collar of his shirt an interesting texture against the corner of his mouth.\nHe breathes in, and out, feels the damp heat of his own breath gather in the fabric.\nEddie\u2019s hand runs up and down his back, the other holding the back of Buck\u2019s head.\nFinally, Buck feels life return to his extremities. He curls weak fingers in the fabric of Eddie\u2019s shirt and decides that even if he doesn\u2019t deserve it, even if he doesn\u2019t get to have this family, he can allow himself to pretend for just this moment\u2026 before it all gets ripped away again.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, Buck,\u201d Eddie says, voice jarring in the quiet. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great. Can you hear me?\u201d\nBuck nods and feels Eddie let out a breath.\n\u201cOkay, you\u2019re okay. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d He rubs his hand a bit quicker up and down Buck\u2019s back, forces little pinpricks to spread out along his skin. He does the same to his arms, his hands, coaxes Buck to sit up and rubs at the flat plane of his sternum too.\nWhen Buck finally looks up to meet his eyes, he\u2019s not prepared for how wrecked Eddie looks, how clearly worry is written on his face.\n\u201cBuck,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI need you to tell me what happened. I'm not mad. But I need to know so I can help you.\u201d The pads of his fingers ghost over the bruises at his side. \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d\nBuck sniffs, wipes at his face with the back of a hand and shakes his head. The words still don\u2019t want to come.\n\u201cBuck\u2014\u201d Eddie starts, and the tone of his voice is enough to make Buck want to sink through the floor. Frustration.\nDisappointment.\nHe shuts his eyes and tries to swallow past the lump in his throat, keeps shaking his head as if that\u2019ll somehow solve all of this.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I went too fast. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He takes one of Buck\u2019s hands and loosely tangles their fingers, gives Buck something else to focus on as he asks, \u201cDid it happen the same time you hurt your back?\u201d\nBuck nods and Eddie gives his hand an encouraging squeeze.\n\u201cWas it during the office fire?\u201d\nBuck nods again.\n\u201cThat was two weeks ago.\u201d Eddie doesn\u2019t sound surprised exactly, just sad. Worried. \u201cDid you tell anyone?\u201d No. \u201cDid you go to the hospital?\u201d No.\nEddie deflates in front of him and Buck can practically see the why hanging off the other man\u2019s lips. Instead, Eddie gives him a soft smile that doesn\u2019t quite reach his eyes.\n\u201cCan I take a look at it?\u201d\nAfter a moment\u2019s hesitation, Buck nods, sits quiet and still while Eddie pokes at the redone stitches and presses gently at the bruising on his back and sides. The gauze and tape get picked up from where they\u2019d been knocked to the side and Eddie covers the wound, steps back when he\u2019s done and holds one hand out to help Buck slide down from the counter.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go lay down, okay?\u201d\nBefore long they\u2019re both stretched out beneath the covers, Buck half on top of Eddie with his face pressed into the other man\u2019s throat. Eddie is warm and solid beneath him and Buck focuses on the rhythm of his breaths, tries to match them. Eventually, his tears dry up, leave him feeling boneless and tired as he settles back into himself. His fingers twitch against Eddie\u2019s chest and he feels shame wash over him like an immense, sucking wave. His entire body tingles with it. He\u2019s drug back out to cold, choppy waters, unsure if he can keep himself afloat. But he has to. Somehow, he has to. He\u2019s already caused enough damage.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, voice hoarse and cracking. \u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d Eddie murmurs. \u201cNot unless you can tell me what it\u2019s for.\u201d\nBuck shuts his eyes tightly, takes a moment to let those words wash over him because honestly whatisn\u2019t it for? He figures there\u2019s one answer in particular Eddie\u2019s looking for.\n\u201cI lied,\u201d Buck says softly.\nEddie hums, strokes a gentle hand up Buck\u2019s back. \u201cYou did,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you were apologizing for.\u201d\nBuck swallows. \u201cI got hurt again.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you did. But accidents happen, you don\u2019t have to apologize for that.\u201d\nThey lay in silence, Buck processing, mind racing. He doesn\u2019t know what Eddie wants him to say, doesn't know the right answer. There\u2019s so much that he has to be sorry for and he\u2019s already said the things he knows have upset Eddie in the past.\nFinally, Buck pulls in a shaky breath, releases it on a whisper. \u201cI failed.\u201d\nThe truth of it settles heavy and constricting in his chest. The words taste bitter on his tongue and his ears burn. Hearing it aloud makes it so much more real.\nEddie starts to speak but Buck shakes his head, hauls himself up so he can wrap his arms around his legs and stare at his knees. He misses Eddie\u2019s warmth immediately but forces that thought aside. He doesn\u2019t deserve it.\n\u201cI tried so hard and\u2014and I still\u2026 I can\u2019t do it again, Eddie. I can\u2019t.\u201d\nEddie sits up beside him, but doesn\u2019t try to touch. \u201cCan\u2019t what?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t lose my job. Lose everything,\u201d he says. \u201cYou guys are all I have and I can\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if\u2014\u201d He chokes on a sob then pulls in a shaky breath.\n\u201cBuck, what are you talking about?\u201d Eddie\u2019s voice is slow, calm, but Buck can still pick up the undercurrent of tension running through each word. \u201cNo one is going to take your job. You might have to take a couple weeks off, but that\u2019s it.\u201d\nBuck stares into nothing, tries to push back the fresh round of tears that won\u2019t do anything but make Eddie worry more, whispers, \u201cNothing\u2019s ever going to change.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want things to change?\u201d Eddie asks softly. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Buck?\u201d\nBuck sucks in a shaky breath and wipes at his eyes. \u201cNothing\u2019s ever going to change because I still mess everything up.\u201d\nAnd god, it hurts how much it\u2019s true. Hurts that no matter how far he\u2019s run or how hard he\u2019s worked, he can\u2019t seem to escape it.\n\u201cBuck, c\u2019mon man,\u201d Eddie says, still careful, like he thinks Buck might break. \u201cYou have to know that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Buck asks, finally turning to look Eddie in the eye. \u201cI was a mess before you met me. Buck 1.0 sucked.\u201d\nEddie opens his mouth to say something, but Buck plows on, needs to get it all out.\n\u201cAnd yeah, sure, maybe Buck 2.0 is better, but Abby still left. I still wasn\u2019t good enough for her. And god, I was such an ass to you that first day.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI thought maybe I was doing better, moving forward, then the explosion happened and I was taken off the team and\u2026 I was so lost, Eddie. And I did something stupid and almost lost all of you because of it, but I was so desperate and I\u2014I\u2019ve already messed it up again.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t mess anything up,\u201d Eddie says, reaching out to cover one of Buck\u2019s hands with his own. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all here to support you. We just want you to be safe.\u201d\nBuck looks away, feels tears pricking his eyes again.\nEddie\u2019s hand tightens. \u201cBuck. You\u2019ve been through a lot, everyone will understand.\u201d\nOh, they\u2019ll understand all right. They\u2019ll understand that Bobby was right and he had no business being back. They\u2019ll understand that he nearly ruined everything with that stupid lawsuit for nothing. They\u2019ll understand that he\u2019s nothing but a liability, not worth keeping around.\nJust one disappointment after the next.\nHe pulls in a shuddering breath and wipes at his eyes, dislodging Eddie\u2019s hand in the process. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Guess you\u2019re all used to it by now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\u201cIt means this,\u201d Buck says, gesturing to his side. \u201cIsn\u2019t exactly going to be a surprise. Just another disappointment.\u201d\n\u201cBuck, no.\u201d Eddie reaches out and puts a hand on Buck\u2019s knee, leans forward until he\u2019s back in his field of vision. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re so afraid of? Disappointing us? Because I promise that thought hadn\u2019t even crossed my mind.\u201d\nAnother tear slips out of the corner of his eye and Buck stares up at the ceiling, tries to blink the rest away. Now isn\u2019t the time to let a few kind words break him down.\n\u201cYou are the furthest thing from a disappointment,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cYou\u2019re brave and kind and smart and funny. You\u2019re so good with Christopher and you give everything you have to your job, to being a hero. You\u2019re the best friend I\u2019ve ever had and I know I speak for everyone when I say that you are loved.\u201d He reaches out and puts a gentle hand on Buck\u2019s cheek, coaxes him to meet his eyes and Buck feels himself crumble at the fierce emotions he finds there.\n\u201cAnd you are not\u00a0a disappointment,\u201d he says, giving Buck a gentle shake. \u201cSo you get that thought out of your head right now, you hear me?\u201d\nTears are running freely down his face, messy streaks on his skin, and he wonders how he has any left at all. His breath hitches and he tries to look away, but Eddie holds him firm, looks right in his eyes and says it again.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a disappointment.\u201d\nHe shifts closer on the bed and pulls Buck down into the crook of his neck, lets him cry into the warm skin there. And god, Buck wants to believe him so bad, wants to wrap himself in those words like a blanket, like a shield, and forget everything else.\nBut his side is still aching and all he can think about is how he has to call Bobby tomorrow and admit what he\u2019s done. He can already hear the resigned sigh, the unspoken I told you so. It makes him cry a little harder, cling to Eddie as the other man leans them back and gets them situated beneath the covers.\nEddie holds him tightly, hands gentle on his skin, rubbing patterns that Buck is too tired to trace. He keeps saying things, too. We love you. We\u2019re so proud of how far you\u2019ve come. You\u2019re a good man.\nThey sweep in and out of Buck\u2019s mind, washing like cool water over the burning ache of shame that\u2019s buried so far down he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever be able to touch its root. Always a disappointment. \nHe\u2019s not sure which voice to believe.\nHe falls asleep with his face pressed to Eddie\u2019s throat, body heavy and detached, like he\u2019s already in a dream.\n--\nBuck wakes up the next morning and has all of five seconds of blissful peace before everything comes rushing back. Eddie\u2019s pressed up against his back, one arm thrown over his waist, and it tightens as soon as Buck shifts, as if he\u2019s afraid Buck is going to run away. As if Buck has anywhere else to go.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Eddie says, voice not nearly as sleep-rough as it should be.\nBuck swallows, tries to clear some of the scratchiness from his throat. \u201cHey.\u201d\nThey lay like that for a few more minutes, Buck slowly taking stock, going over the night before. He\u2019s never been ashamed of crying, but having a complete meltdown in front of Eddie\u2026if it weren\u2019t for the other man\u2019s iron grip around his waist, he might just sink right into the floor and disappear. And now that the cat\u2019s out of the bag, he knows he needs to call Bobby. Which means more disappointment, some scolding, and getting taken off duty for a few weeks at best, getting permanently sidelined, maybe even fired, at worst.\n\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too hard.\u201d Eddie squeezes Buck a little tighter then props himself up on an elbow. \u201cWe\u2019ll take everything one step at a time. Together. You aren\u2019t alone, Buck.\u201d\nBuck doesn\u2019t have the heart to correct him. He pushes himself up and rubs at his eyes, no doubt still red and puffy from the night before.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna go take a shower,\u201d he mumbles, standing up and noting that Eddie had taken off both their shoes at some point in the night. The door shuts behind him and he sighs, tries to let the warm water wash everything away.\nHe\u2019s barely shut off the water when there\u2019s a brief knock on the door, followed by it opening a crack.\n\u201cCan I come in?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t stop you last night,\u201d Buck grumbles, cinching his towel a little tighter around his hips.\nEddie sighs but comes in anyway, sets some clothes on the counter then gestures for Buck to come closer. \u201cLet me take a look at your stitches.\u201d\nSeeing no way around it, Buck acquiesces, leans up against the counter and tires to ignore the heat of Eddie\u2019s hands on his skin, the weight of his gaze. Now would be an incredibly inappropriate time to pop a boner. Nothing like confessing your feelings for your best friend after spending the night getting snot on his shoulder.\nIt doesn\u2019t take long before he\u2019s patched up to Eddie\u2019s satisfaction and dressed in clean sweats and a t-shirt, sitting on the couch and staring at his phone while Eddie scrounges in the kitchen.\n\u201cYou want some eggs?\u201d\n\u201cI can make my own breakfast,\u201d Buck calls back. He\u2019s got Bobby\u2019s contact on the screen, but he\u2019s nowhere near ready to press that call button.\nHe hears a sigh and looks up to see Eddie walking towards him. \u201cI know you can, Buck. I was asking if you wanted some, because I\u2019m making some for myself and it wouldn\u2019t be any problem to throw a few more in the pan. Especially since they\u2019re your eggs to begin with.\u201d\nBuck huffs and quickly locks his phone when Eddie comes to sit down beside him, obviously not quick enough by the way Eddie sighs again and knocks Buck\u2019s knee with his own.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so worried. Bobby\u2019s a good guy, you know that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah and he was right.\u201d Buck runs a hand across his face. \u201cI didn\u2019t deserve to be back in the team and he knew that, but I just\u2014\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cHey, no,\u201d Eddie cuts him off. \u201cBobby kept you off duty out of concern for your safety and his own personal feelings about you. You were on blood thinners and he\u2019d seen you nearly die a few times too many as it was.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you think this is going to help that?\u201d Buck asks, voice rising. \u201cHe\u2019s going to realize it was a mistake bringing me back. Who knows how long he\u2019ll want to bench me this time.\u201d\n\u201cProbably two or three weeks, Buck. And we\u2019ll all be waiting for you to come back.\u201d\nBuck shakes his head. \u201cYou don\u2019tget it. This job is my life. My whole entire life. When the rest of you guys go home, there\u2019s someone waiting. And\u2014and you have kids, partners, families. A purpose. But without this job, I\u2014 I don\u2019t have anything. I can\u2019t mess it up again. I can\u2019t.\u201d\nEddie\u2019s eyes go wide, realization dawning on every inch of his face. \u201cBuck, no.\u201d He shifts on the couch to face Buck fully, puts a hand on his shoulder, thumb pressing hot and firm against his skin. \u201cYou are so much more than this job. And us, your family, we\u2019re going to be here no matter what.\u201d\nHe looks so earnest, so sure, that Buck doesn't have the heart to point out how he\u2019s wrong, to remind him how easily families break apart. All it takes is a little too much stress, a little too much distance. He\u2019s familiar with the process, doesn\u2019t really care to relive it.\nHe stands up and Eddie\u2019s hand falls back to his side.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to call Bobby.\u201d \u00a0\nHe doesn't look back as he takes the stairs two at a time, locks himself in the bathroom and presses the call button like ripping off a bandaid. Better to get it over with.\nBobby picks up on the second ring.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cHey, Bobby. It\u2019s me. Is now a good time?\u201d\n\u201cSure, Buck, of course.\u201d There\u2019s a rustling sound, noises and soft voices, and then quiet, like he\u2019s stepped into a separate room. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I uh\u2014I just need to ask for some time off.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a pause and Buck can picture the concerned confusion on Bobby\u2019s face.\n\u201cTime off? For how long?\u201d\n\u201cGuess that\u2019s up to you and the doctors,\u201d Buck says. \u201cHowever long it takes for a few stitches to heal.\u201d\n\u201cStiches. You\u2019re hurt?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I mean. I\u2019m fine. Just, a little banged up.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened? Are you at the hospital?\u201d\n\u201cNo. No, I\u2019m at home.\u201d\n\u201cDid you go to the hospital?\u201d\n\u201cNo? I\u2019m fine, Bobby. Honestly. If I was going to bleed out, I would\u2019ve done it by now.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long, long pause and Buck wants to smack himself at the slip. Not exactly how he\u2019d planned this conversation to go. He\u2019d been hoping to ease into things, maybe even avoid certain parts all together. But Bobby knows him too well for that.\n\u201cIt was the call a couple weeks ago wasn\u2019t it? When you ripped your coat.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Bobby, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t been to the hospital?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m coming over right now and we\u2019re getting you checked over. You\u2019re still on blood thinners, Buck.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d he says. \u201cI know. But I promise you, I\u2019m fine. Eddie checked me over last night and you know if he\u2019d found anything he would\u2019ve drug me to the ER himself.\u201d\n\u201cIs he still there?\u201d\n\u201cIs he\u2014yeah? I mean, he\u2019s downstairs, but what\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPut him on the phone please.\u201d\n\u201cBobby\u2026\u201d Buck says, only a little embarrassed that it comes out sounding like a whine.\n\u201cBuck. I can call him myself. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d\nBuck huffs and swings open the bathroom door, is only slightly surprised to find Eddie on the other side for the second time in as many days.\nHe hands him the phone with a muttered, \u201cBobby wants to talk to you\u201d then crawls back into bed and pulls up the covers, decides he might as well get a head start on his future plans.\nHe listens as Eddie talks, voice low and steady, answering questions and filling Bobby in on what happened, the state of Buck\u2019s back and side, and the fact that he\u2019d worked for two weeks with the injury hidden beneath his clothes.\nThere\u2019s a tug on his blanket and Eddie pulls back one corner, sits on the edge of the mattress and puts the phone on speaker.\n\u201cBuck? You there, kid?\u201d\nBuck doesn\u2019t bother moving, just says \u201cYeah\u201d into the covers and presses his eyes shut, prepares for the blow.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but we can\u2019t have someone so reckless on the team.\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re just not ready.\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re done.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry if my concern for you made you feel like you had to hide this. I want you to be safe, but I also want you to be happy and I\u2019m not going to force you to quit a job you love just because I\u2019m uncomfortable with the possibility of you getting hurt.\u201d\nBuck\u2019s eyes pinched tight, brow furrowed, not really able to process everything he\u2019s hearing, because this sounds too much like forgiveness, too much like another second chance.\n\u201cSo yes, you\u2019re going to be off duty for a few weeks while you heal, but I\u2019m not going to stand in your way of coming back. I want you here, with us. We all do.\u201d\nHe blinks up at Eddie, takes in the other man\u2019s encouraging smile. \u201cI\u2014what?\u201d He sits up, picks up the phone and holds it closer just in case he\u2019s hearing wrong. \u201cSo you\u2019re not\u2026 you\u2019re not mad?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not mad. I\u2019m worried, and a little upset that you didn\u2019t tell anyone, but I think we all saw something was wrong. We just didn\u2019t want to push. I\u2019m glad Eddie finally did, sounds like you needed it.\u201d\nBuck huffs out a laugh and glances over at Eddie as sweet, heady relief washes through him, meets warm brown eyes and feels a little more tension slip from his shoulders. \u201cYeah, I think I did.\u201d\nThe rest of the phone call passes in a blur and Buck is left sitting in the middle of his bed, covers tangled around his waist and staring down at his phone, dark and silent in his lap.\nEddie\u2019s hand squeezes his shoulder. \u201cYou ready to come have breakfast now?\u201d\nBuck nods, doesn\u2019t question it when Eddie\u2019s hand drops down to grab his own, helps tug him off the bed then just doesn\u2019t let go, leads him down the stairs and into the kitchen before pressing him up against one of the counters.\n\u201cYou ready to start believing we want you around?\u201d\nBuck cracks a smile, feels a thousand pounds lighter as everything sinks in. He\u2019s not losing his job. Bobby isn\u2019t mad at him, doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s a failure. Eddie is still here, watching him patiently with a fond smile on his face.\n\nIt\u2019s okay.\n\n\u201cKeep looking at me like that and I just might.\u201d\nEddie laughs and Buck feels himself flush, can\u2019t help but wonder at the way Eddie\u2019s eyes briefly flick down to his mouth before coming back up to meet his eyes.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I know how else to look at you, querido. So I guess you\u2019d better start believing.\u201d\nHe gives Buck\u2019s hand a final squeeze then steps away, turns back to the stove and starts cracking eggs into a bowl. Buck can only stare at his back, dumbfounded, watching the shifting of his muscles beneath his t-shirt and wondering how things have taken such a turn.\nLast night, he had been so caught up in his fears and the failures of his past that he\u2019d almost let them overtake him, pull him under until he couldn\u2019t see the light. But Eddie dragged him back to the surface, held him there even when Buck tried to push him away. And now, the older man is humming in his kitchen, dressed in a pair of Buck\u2019s sweats that are dragging slightly on the floor.\nIt makes him feel so full he could burst, like if he opened his mouth he\u2019d yell with all the sudden relief and happiness bubbling up inside. He still feels a little shaky, a little tired, and he knows the next few weeks are going to be rough, that the darkness and fears are going to come back and try to pull him under.\nBut for now, he\u2019s okay.\nIt\u2019s okay.\n\nIt\u2019s okay.\n\n--\nOne week later and he\u2019s sitting on Eddie\u2019s couch, Christopher curled up to his side and snoring softly. They\u2019ve just come back from dinner at Bobby\u2019s, everyone there who didn\u2019t have a shift, and Christopher is tuckered out. It felt amazing to be surrounded by his friends, to have them smile and joke and tell him to come back quickly, that they miss him. It felt like belonging, in a way he hardly ever feels outside the firehouse.\nHe\u2019s still buzzing with it, and the feeling only grows when Eddie puts an arm around his shoulders, makes his whole body light up as they press together from shoulder to thigh.\nAnd when Eddie goes to put Christopher to bed once the show is over, meets Buck in the hallway and looks at him the way he had in Buck\u2019s kitchen, the way he had a few weeks ago in this exact spot, Buck takes a step closer, lets Eddie grab his hips and reel him in.\n\u201cYou believing it yet?\u201d\nBuck\u2019s eyes flutter, a little lost in the heat of Eddie pressed all up along his front. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cThat we want you around,\u201d Eddie says, one hand sneaking up under the fabric of Buck\u2019s shirt. \u201cThat we want you here.\u201d He leans up and presses a gentle kiss to Buck\u2019s temple. \u201cBecause I do. Don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you, Buck.\u201d\u00a0\nBuck shudders at the words and lets his eyes slip shut, hands grabbing at Eddie\u2019s biceps and pulling him closer, until those strong arms wrap around him and hold him close. It feels safe and warm and solid, like the ground has finally stopped shifting beneath his feet.\nEddie\u2019s lips are warm against his cheek, beneath his jaw, and Buck stays motionless beneath them, soaks up each touch like a promise and tucks them away for later. When his eyes finally open, Eddie is already looking back at him. His thumb brushes over Buck\u2019s bottom lip.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he breathes. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s perfect.\n\n--\n\u00a0"
