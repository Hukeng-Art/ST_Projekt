    "text": "\nDanny was injured and he needs to leave \n\nnow. \n\nHe just needs to make it to his parents\u2019 lab and get to the portal then he\u2019ll be free. He\u2019s going to be honest he and his friends and sister knew something like this could happen. Being hunted down even if he was still Danny Fenton and not just Phantom. They needed a plan other than fuck around and find out.\n\n\nSo here he is getting into the Specter Speeder about to be launched into the depths of the Ghost Zone to escape possible vivisection. He was too weak to travel through the Zone by himself so he\u2019ll need to take it. Rushing and trying to keep his ghost form from bleeding out he doesn\u2019t notice how the controls flicker. All he knows is he needs to leave.\n\n\nWith the Speeder ready to go he leans back in the pilot seat \ufffcand gets ready to heal slower than usual. Before he knows it he\u2019s off into the portal and the swirling of green around him and the humming of the technology surrounding him lulls him to sleep.\n\n\nHe\u2019s not conscious enough to realize something is wrong. \ufffc\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\nWhen the watch tower gets an alert that there was an energy spike close to earth and a green portal opened up only to shoot out a pod-looking space ship everyone is vigilant. Batman was able to trace it to tell that it was going to land in a desert in the middle of nowhere. Well more like crash considering it was spinning out of control and was only picking up speed and not slowing down.\n\n\nWith Superman, Green Lantern, and Batman choosing to deal with this they were quickly off to the landing sight. It was nothing too impressive but there was a small crater where the pod landed. Nothing emerged from it as they got closer it was almost like there was nothing inside at all. It wasn\u2019t until Superman heard a faint buzzing sound that seemed to mimic a heartbeat and breathing he could barely even detect due to it being too slow and shallow that a cause of urgency kicked in. Not waiting any more time the lid to the pod was ripped off of its hinges and inside lay a boy.\n\n\nA young boy who seemed to be in his early teens was asleep in the pilot seat and he seemed gravely injured. None of the men there could dismiss the fact that the child was also very much not human. He had Snow White hair and his skin had a slight blue tint to it that made it look less than normal. He also wore something that could resemble a space suit or a hazmat suit. On his chest was a stylized D or P maybe a combination of both. None of them knew what it meant but for all they knew of this strange new boy it could be a family crest like Superman\u2019s S.\n\n\nThey quickly returned to the watch tower where the boy could get medical attention. He was injured in a number of places that would be very concerning but they were healing quickly. This didn\u2019t stop the med bay doctors from stitching up what they could although they had to do it twice when they noticed that the stitches were melting. They used the same material they used on Meta\u2019s with deterioration powers.\n\n\nAs the boy slept the Justice League held a meeting to discuss what to do with the boy.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously an alien which means he falls under my jurisdiction. Let me deal with him and find out where he\u2019s from.\u201d Green Lantern laid out his argument.\n\n\n\u201cHe is an unknown. We don\u2019t know what his arrival could mean.\u201d Batman was cautious of the new arrival.\n\n\n\u201cHe is a child! He might be an alien but he is obviously a child.\u201d Superman felt a sort of kinship with the young alien. He reminded him of himself. Sent to a new world, he\u2019ll probably be confused when he wakes.\n\n\nEventually, they are able to come to an agreement. Wait for the child to wake, get any information they could, and decide how to proceed when they are better informed.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\nIt took a full 48 hours for Danny to wake up although he didn\u2019t know the full time. All he knew was he went to sleep in the speeder and woke up to a pace vaguely resembling a hospital. Freaking out because a hospital is the last place he expected to end up, especially such a human-looking one. He would have been calmer if it was at least the Far Frozen hospital.\n\n\nHe was not hooked up to anything but he could feel the stitches that are in his skin. He noticed how he was completely healed and yet there were stitches in places he remembered being more injured. Going intangible in the places they were placed he quickly got rid of them.\n\n\nFeeling uneasy in this new place Danny was quick to make an escape. When he couldn\u2019t open the door he went through it and ran down the maze of halls. He kept running until he came across a man walking down the halls in the opposite way he was coming. He wore a red suit that reminded Danny of his own hazmat suit.\n\n\nThe man spotted him as Danny ran past him yelling, \u201cHey kid! Wait!\u201d But Danny paid no mind to it until he noticed the man suddenly appeared in front of him in a red blur. Danny screeched to a halt for long enough for the man to say, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to run it-\u201d he didn\u2019t stick around long enough to hear what the man had to say.\n\n\nFloating off the ground there was enough room for Danny to fly straight over the man. He continued to fly close to the ceiling and phased through walls and doors when necessary. He didn\u2019t come to a halt until he got to what looked like a meeting room with a few other people. He paid the people no mind because all he could focus on was the stars threw the window.\n\n\nRight out on the other side of a window was a galaxy Danny thought he was never going to be able to see. He\u2019s been to space before but that was in dire situations and he wasn\u2019t able to take anything in. Now even through his panic, he couldn\u2019t help the awe and amazement from appearing on his face. Very slowly he floated closer to the glass until he could rest his hand on it. He stared out into the deep void until he felt a hand on his shoulder.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\nA few of the Justices League members were in a meeting about the boy who hasn\u2019t woken up yet when said boy comes flying through the door. Quite literally flying through the door. The boy seemed to be perfectly fine. The previous day they discovered that the suit he wore repaired itself as he healed. It was perfectly intact with no tears or rips\ufffc to be seen.\n\n\nThe boy was floating a few feet above the ground and the blatant display of power surprised a few Leaguers. This also showed Batman what the alien\u2019s life or planet was like. No hesitation to use powers and they came naturally to him. This isn\u2019t a Superman situation where the sun gave him his powers but maybe more of a Martian where they have powers due to their biology.\n\n\nThe boy looked to be panicking, most likely from waking up in an unknown space. But his face quickly changed to amazement when his bright green eyes landed on the window. He seemed to zero in on it and slowly floated to it until he was close enough to touch it.\n\n\nThey just stared at the kid for a bit until Superman floated over to him and put a hand on his shoulder. This seemed to get his attention as he tensed under the hand. He looked up at Superman and the man tried to send him a comforting smile.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to panic, we are here to help,\u201d Superman said in a soft voice. One he used in scared civilians.\n\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d The boy questioned. The League members were both surprised and great full that the alien child knew English, it would make communicating much easier.\n\n\n\u201cI go by Superman, but my name is Kal-El. My friends and I just want to help you and maybe get you home.\u201d The boy tensed further at the mention of home.\n\n\n\u201cThere is no home to go back to.\u201d He looked down at his feet and seemed to notice for the first time that they were not touching the ground, and neither was Superman\u2019s.\n\n\nHe softly landed on the ground and looked back up at Clark with surprise written all over his face. He looked over at the other heroes in the room, truly seeing them for the first time. Both Batman and Manhunter took notice of how his eyes lingered on J\u2019onn the most.\n\n\nIt was quiet for a moment, the adults letting the boy take everything in. Wonder Woman was the one to break the peace. \u201cMay we ask for your name, young one?\u201d His attention snapped to the one who addressed him and hesitantly he said, \u201cMy name is Phantom, Danny Phantom.\u201d\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\nAs Danny looked around the room he came to the conclusion he was nowhere close to home. He thinks he would remember if there were people like this. He stared at a man who has green skin for a moment longer than the rest. He would have thought he was a ghost if it weren\u2019t for his ghost senses not going off.\n\n\nHe was introduced to the rest of the adults after telling them his name. They informed him of what they were and how they were heroes and that just solidified Danny's thoughts of not being home or even in the same world. It wasn\u2019t too crazy to think that he ended up in a different world, a different dimension when the Ghost Zones alternative name is the Infinite Realms.\n\n\nThese people also seem to think he is an alien like a few of them. Considering the fact they saw him appear in the Specter Speeder and he is literally from a different world wasn\u2019t a far-off guess. He called his plant Amity and let them believe he was what they think he is.\n\n\nThey asked a lot of questions, some Danny answered as best as possible and others he bullshitted his way through. They came to the conclusion his planet no longer exists and he is the last of his kind. Danny wasn\u2019t about to correct them, who knew what they would think of a half-ghost.\n\n\nHe learned that the one he thought was a ghost\u2019s name was J\u2019onn J\u2019onzz and he was a Martian from Mars. This immediately caught Danny\u2019s attention as he asked a million questions about Mars.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\nThe boy, Danny as they now knew, seemed to take a liking to J\u2019onn the most. They can see why with his bluish skin and similar power set. He seemed to want to know everything and anything about Mars and Martians. J\u2019onn was happy to indulge the boy and answer as many questions as possible.\n\n\nThe questions eventually leaned to powers and how similar some of their powers were. J\u2019onn showed Danny how he can shift his form to look like others and even showed him his human secret identity form. Danny taking a chance said, \u201cI can do something like that too! Hey Batman?\u201d He turned to the dark knight and he got a grunt in response. \u201cCan I see what human teenagers look like?\u201d A little surprised and confused by this question but not seeing the harm in it Bruce pulled up pictures of random teens on his wrist\ufffc computer, showing it to Danny. The kid smiled and said thanks and a ring of light appeared around him.\n\n\nBatman, the closest, closed his eyes at the bright light and when he opened them again a very human boy with slightly softer features and different clothing appeared in Danny\u2019s place.\n\n\n\u201cHow do I look? Human enough?\u201d He turned in a circle like he was showing off a new outfit.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\nDanny can see the surprise on some of the League\u2019s faces at his sudden shift. He thought it was quite smart of himself to label his halfa status as simply being able to change his form. He was getting more confident in being here the more he learned.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDanny has been in this new world for a few days. It\u2019s exactly like his and yet so different. They have mostly the same media and celebrities and even history but then this world has superheroes and villains. He\u2019s been staying in the watchtower in what seemed to be a spare room. They don\u2019t know what to do with him yet but they aren\u2019t suspicious.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhenever questioned about his home planet he just talks about the Infinite Realms. He was asked what it looked like and Danny said mainly green with floating islands. When questioned how he can speak English he said he can speak a lot of different languages from all over. It helps that that wasn\u2019t a lie, he really can speak all kinds of languages. Some he didn\u2019t even know existed like Superman\u2019s mother language. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt comes in handy when you have the knowledge of the Realms to fall back into. It makes Danny seem otherworldly in a way he was all too used to back home. Here it was a new type of normal. It made him feel normal and less like the freak he was known as back home. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen questioned about his abilities Danny answered as truthfully as possible. He told them that he was more powerful than average but everyone back home had some type of invisibility, intangibility, and flying. His powers didn\u2019t stem from the sun or something else unique from earth but just his biology. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThis of course led to him having to demonstrate a majority of his powers.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey took him to a training room out of the watchtower and down on earth. Danny was nervous at first when Batman said they were going to run some tests, thinking back to the reason he left his home in the first place. But likely seeing the nerves on his face and in the way he held himself Black Canary was quick to reassure him it would be more like a show and tell. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBack in his ghost form, and wasn\u2019t that fun to explain he can change forms at will, Danny stood in the middle of a training mat not really knowing what to do first. Black Canary and Batman were the only people observing him and they weren\u2019t even in the same room. There was a glass window separating Danny from the adults due to his own request. He didn\u2019t want them getting in the way of energy blasts or ice. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust start with whatever\u2019s easiest and work your way up from there.\u201d Black Canary\u2019s voice came through the intercom speaker. Danny just gave her a thumbs-up and started flying in place. This was definitely the easiest thing to do. Losing the hold gravity has on him was like taking off an extra layer in the sun. It felt better to float and fly in his ghost form than it did to have his feet on the ground. \n\n\u00a0\n\nStaying visible he went back down to the ground but let intangibility take over his legs so he slipped right into the earth. He came back up and went invisible. These were all powers the League knew well due to their extended use. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDanny set off a few ecto blasts towards the far wall leaving burn marks. He let out both more chaotic blasts that were big and powerful and hard to control and more concentrated blasts that left small marks. This was to show his control and he did the same with his ice. He let the temperature drop to freezing levels watching as the window iced over. \n\n\u00a0\n\nFloating down to the ground he changed back to his human form to signal that he was done. Danny might trust these people but he\u2019s not stupid enough to show them everything he can do. He doesn\u2019t even remember his entire power set off the top of his head. The basics should be enough to satisfy them. Walking towards the window he turned intangible going through the wall. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s it!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite the power range.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah but only the ice is really uniquely mine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe small group headed back for the watchtower to properly debrief and talk about Danny\u2019s powers. Although Danny did stop by his room to grab a model spaceship he was given. It was one that you had to put together yourself. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe group of three went to the meeting room where there were a few hero\u2019s lounging around talking to one another. The meeting room was used as a sort of common room when there were no pressing matters to attend to. Danny changed back into Phantom as they situated themselves.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAs you\u2019ve said before, the people of your home planet all have invisibility, intangibility, and flying. Are you sure you don\u2019t remember which sector your planet is from?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know much about other planets. It wasn\u2019t a part of my education back home.\u201d Danny was in the air with his legs crossed like he was sitting in a chair. He was fiddling with a model spaceship with pieces and tools floating around him, coming closer when he needed them. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat was schooling like back home?\u201d He doesn\u2019t know who asked because he was too focused on his project. Maybe it was rude to be working on this when people were trying to talk to him but he couldn\u2019t help it. Superman gave it to him earlier that morning and he was excited to display it in his room. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was pretty average for the most part.\u201d Danny thought back on the American public education system, \u201cmaybe a bit below average for my town. But when I was named prince I was put through more advanced lessons that weren\u2019t all that traditional.\u201d He said, not really paying attention to what was coming out of his mouth. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was silent for a bit and Danny wondered why before realizing what he said. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re royalty?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nDanny sheepishly rubbed the back of his neck and felt his face grow hot. \u201cYeah\u2026 I was named the crown prince a little while ago. I was supposed to be crowned king when I was of age.\u201d He noticed he got the attention of everyone in the room, which wasn\u2019t a lot but it was enough for his cheeks to glow green under the attention. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBatman seemed to narrow his eyes at him but Danny could never really tell with him. \u201cAnd why didn\u2019t you share this information before?\u201d Danny shrugged and tried to go back to his project, screwing some pieces in place. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t seem all that important. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m royalty here so why would it matter?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou said you would have been crowned king when you came of age, did something happen to the current king?\u201d Wonder Woman chimed in as she walked over to sit closer to Danny. Danny chewed on his cheek wondering how much he should say. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere is no current king. I defeated him in single combat so I took the throne. The only reason I didn\u2019t take the crown as well is that I was too young.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe title of king doesn\u2019t go down to the next of kin in the royal family?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDanny shrugged again. He knew the way the Ghost Zone didn\u2019t work normally, none of it did, but he didn\u2019t need these adults judging it. \u201cThe King is the most powerful person; it has nothing to do with blood ties. I didn\u2019t even want the crown. The only reason I took the title is that the last king was a tyrant who needed to be stopped.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nSuperman had a look of concern and maybe even pity on his face, \u201cBut you are a child. Why couldn\u2019t an adult take the challenge?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI asked myself that a lot too\u2026 Can we talk about something else?\u201d Batman seemed like he wanted to press further but Canary stepped in.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve shown how you can speak many different languages, some you didn\u2019t even know of, what\u2019s your home planet\u2019s language?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nDanny set down his project, letting it fall softly to the table so that he can finally give the heroes his full attention. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you will be able to take it.\u201d He knew mortals couldn\u2019t understand or even really comprehend Ghost Speak. \u201cYou need very specific vocal cords.\u201d More like no vocal cords at all. \u201cB\u0335\u033e\u031a\u0300\u0317\u0316\u033au\u0334\u0344\u0347t\u0334\u0307\u034a\u030d\u0354\u0325 \u0337\u030e\u031b\u0306\u0333\u032a\u0348h\u0338\u0340\u032co\u0336\u0313\u035b\u030f\u0356w\u0337\u0350\u031a\u0311\u032f\u034d\u031d \u0336\u0305\u030b\u0325d\u0337\u0341\u0341\u0358\u0327o\u0335\u033e\u0352\u0353\u0339\u032ae\u0336\u0357\u0313\u0352\u031d\u031cs\u0335\u0350\u034b\u031c\u0325\u031f \u0334\u035b\u0318t\u0334\u030d\u0300\u0353\u0354h\u0335\u0312\u0344\u0350\u0332i\u0338\u0304\u032es\u0338\u0309\u033e\u035d\u0331\u0324 \u0336\u0340\u0311\u030e\u0354\u0320s\u0335\u0340\u0349\u035co\u0334\u0346\u0310\u0322u\u0337\u030e\u0309\u0303\u0327\u0354n\u0334\u0308\u0333\u034d\u032cd\u0335\u030b\u033e\u0352\u0318?\u201d He let the noise come out of his mouth. To him, it was just a different language, no stranger than any other. But to the heroes, it was like static to a radio and nails on a chalkboard and many voices overlapping each other in different pitches. The words were echoing inside their skulls. The heroes with super hearing covered their ears with their hands but it did nothing to help. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think I should speak like that again,\u201d Danny said in regular English. Batman was of course the quickest to recover. \u201cMaybe not\u2026\u201d He agreed ominously. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNext on the agenda, I would like to discuss a more permanent living situation for you.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI thought I was good to stay at the watchtower?\u201d Were they kicking him out? \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI, along with some other members, have decided that it would be more beneficial for you to be among people your age. Going to school and being down on earth would be better than staying up here.\u201d Danny couldn\u2019t help but groan at the mention of school. He knew no matter what universe or dimension it was going to be hell. Black Canary started talking, gaining the boy\u2019s attention, \u201cWe still want you to have some say and control in what happens to you so we gathered some options on who to stay with. You can decide where you would like to settle down and you will have time to think it over. This isn\u2019t a right now decision, we will give you time to think it over.\u201d Danny can appreciate that they want to take his thoughts into count but in the end, none of this was his say. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBlack Canary handed him some files from seemingly out of nowhere and with further inspection Danny saw they were on some different heroes. \u201cThese are people who are all willing to take you in.\u201d She smiled at him, seemingly having noticed his unease. Danny hasn\u2019t had a good experience with people wanting to adopt him in the past. Quickly skimming through the files he\u2019s surprised to find Batman and not so surprised to find Superman. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCan I go to my room to think this over?\u201d He asked quietly, not looking up from the papers in his hand. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith that, he got up and floated out of the room, his projects drifting behind him. He had some thinking to do and he would like to do it in the privacy of his own room. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe didn\u2019t notice Canary informing Batman, \u201cHe didn\u2019t say he had telekinesis\u2026\u201d And Batman hummed in acknowledgment. \n\n\u00a0\n\nGetting to his room and locking the door behind him he spread out the files along his desk. Looking around the room he notices what he will have to pack up to move in with whoever he chooses. There\u2019s already some stuff cluttering the room. The bed sheets are a deep navy blue, they used to be plain white. There are glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling that Green Lantern got him within his first week when he mentioned he liked looking into space. A pre-built model car was on his nightstand that Flash got Danny when he mentioned to him that he was interested in engineering. A sword hung on his wall from when Wonder Woman thought he would appreciate it considering he said how cool her sword fighting was. Something called a Nintendo Switch was sitting on his bed from Batman. He didn\u2019t mention anything about video games to the man and he had to learn how to use it because he had nothing like it back home. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHis lack of knowledge of games seemed to drive home how otherworldly he was. \n\n\u00a0\n\nLooking back to the files Danny focused on the task at hand. He had a decision to make and he wasn\u2019t going to half-ass this one. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt seemed important. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDanny was face down on his bed trying not to scream. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe people who wanted him (and isn\u2019t that crazy? People, adults, actually wanted him) seemed so amazing and it was getting frustrating trying to pick. It\u2019s been two days already going around talking to the people who submitted a file trying to get to know them better. They said he had no time limit but he can tell the Justice League was getting antsy for his answer. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDanny pushed himself onto his forearms so he wasn\u2019t actively suffocating himself with his bed and huffed out a breath. It was earlier in the morning according to his clock, not that he can tell with his window just being space. He was still in his pajamas, a simple white baggy t-shirt and black pajama pants with yellow stars. Rolling off his bed dramatically he let himself hit the ground with a loud thud. He stared at the glow-in-the-dark star stickers on his ceiling trying to will himself to get up and change into actual clothes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe had someone else to meet today. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOne person he didn\u2019t even know about submitted a file to adopt him. Some guy named Nightwing who\u2019s apparently a part of Batman\u2019s ragtag team of sad vigilantes, at least that\u2019s what Flash said. He never even met the dude before so why the hell he wants to adopt him is lost on Danny. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThere was a knock on his door and he heard Superman\u2019s voice coming through from the other side, \u201cDanny? Are you awake kiddo? Nightwing will be here to take you to lunch in a bit.\u201d Danny sat up and yelled back, \u201cYeah I\u2019m up! Just rolling out of bed\u2026\u201d He added quietly even though he knew Kal-El would hear him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nFinally getting up he went over to his closet that is steadily gaining more and more clothes. There was a plethora of hoodies, jeans, and plain shirts. The heroes seemed to notice his preference for non-graphic shirts unless space themed. Grabbing black jeans, a dark green shirt, and a white hoodie with the classic NASA logo that J\u2019onn gave him yesterday Danny started getting ready. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe phantom walked into the bathroom connected to his room to try to comb his hair only to give up and brush his teeth. Some of his teeth were now naturally more pointy than normal humans. It adds to the not-really-human theme he has going on. That and his pointy ears\u2026 and the fact his eyes gleam like a cat\u2019s. Maybe it\u2019s not really a theme but a fact. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDanny can have a minor crisis over that later right now he has to meet Nightwing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWalking into the eating area that\u2019s used more of a lounge area Danny walks over to where there is a couch in the corner and dramatically flops onto it. He can hear some of the heroes in the room snicker at him but he just lays there. Sitting up he sees Flash and Green Lantern looking at him eating muffins. Flash was inhaling them more than anything. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDamn are they good?\u201d Danny asked Flash teasingly with one of his eyebrows raised. He\u2019s learned that some heroes he can joke around like that with, Flash being one of them. The hero in red just throws a muffin at him and in a very childish motion sticks his tongue out. Danny catches it with no problem and starts eating. It\u2019s blueberry. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHalfway through someone else walks into the room. He was wearing a skin-tight black suit that had a blue bird-type logo on his chest. He also had a domino mask that whited out his eyes. He has black hair and Danny would have called him a loser for his mullet at least it wasn\u2019t a country hick one. It took Danny longer than he was willing to admit that the guy was walking over towards him. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re Danny right?\u201d The guy who Danny now assumes is Nightwing asked. \u201cYep.\u201d He took another bite. \u201cI\u2019m Nightwing, whenever you\u2019re ready we can head out.\u201d He sent what would have been a charming smile if Danny couldn\u2019t feel the nervousness coming off of this guy. \u201cNow\u2019s fine.\u201d If he was put off at all by Danny\u2019s short answer he didn\u2019t show it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nQuickly finishing his muffin the teen got up from the couch and followed close behind the man as they walked to the zeta tubes. \u201cWhere\u2019re we going? I\u2019ve barely been outside the watchtower.\u201d And that\u2019s true, Danny can count on one hand how many times he was taken down to earth in the few weeks he\u2019s been here. Nightwing looked down at him and replied, \u201cWe\u2019re going to Gotham. You been to Gotham?\u201d Danny simply shakes his head no. \u201cThat\u2019s where I live, well technically I live in Bludhaven, Gotham's sister city, but I\u2019m pretty evenly split between the two. I know I said I was taking you out to lunch but it\u2019s only eleven we can do something else until you\u2019re hungry.\u201d They stopped in front of the zeta tube as Danny thought of what to do until lunchtime. \u201cCan we go sightseeing? I heard that the architecture of Gotham is very interesting.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but be reminded of Sam and how much she would have loved it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nNightwing nodded at him, humming a bit, \u201cSure we can sightsee although the best view is up high.\u201d Danny grinned something feral, for a split second he wondered if Nightwing would be freaked out by his teeth. \u201cThe higher the better.\u201d Danny transformed into his ghost form with a bright flash. When the flash went away he saw Nightwing blink repeatedly with a somewhat shocked look on his face. \u201cI knew you could manipulate your form but I didn\u2019t realize the transformation was that bright.\u201d Danny rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly, \u201cYeah sorry for not warning you about that.\u201d Nightwing raised his hand slightly like he was going to touch Danny but thought better of it. \u201cIt\u2019s fine kiddo. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nWalking into the zeta tube they arrived in some alleyway phone booth that was run down. Danny walked out first noticing how he glowed slightly in the dark alley even though it was early. Looking up he saw how cloudy it was almost like it was going to rain any minute. Nightwing seemed to notice his looks because he explained, \u201cIt won\u2019t rain until tonight but most of the time it\u2019s cloudy like this.\u201d Danny just nodded instead of answering properly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNightwing pulled a grappling hook from nowhere and with no further warning he took off to the top of the nearest building. Danny was quick on his heels and flew after the man. It was fun, Danny can admit that. He didn\u2019t know what he was expecting but it wasn\u2019t this. Maybe some awkward small talk that most adults do when they don\u2019t know what to say to a kid. Nightwing made it easy. Being around Nightwing was easy. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey gradually got to higher and higher buildings and the buildings seemed to get older too. There were gargoyles decorating them and Danny was having fun perching on them like a bird. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey! How fast can you fly?\u201d Nightwing asked as he did a truly amazing flip through the air. Danny was sure if he needed to breathe he would be out of breath if he tried that. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUhhhh I don\u2019t really know?\u201d It sounded more like a question than an answer. \u201cI never really tested it out.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey landed on the edge of a building overlooking the city. Danny sat down mid-air so he didn\u2019t have to crane his neck to look up at Nightwing who was still standing. \u201cDoes it take up much energy to stay in the air like that?\u201d Nightwing still had to look down a bit to look Danny in the eyes. \u201cNot really? At least I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s easy and comfortable to stay in the air, like second nature.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow different is earth from your home planet?\u201d Danny almost wanted to laugh at that. The Ghost Zone was completely different from earth to the point everything might as well be opposite. \u201cAlmost as different as life and death.\u201d He chuckled a bit at his inside joke that he knew Nightwing wouldn\u2019t understand. \u201cThe sky was green and there was no gravity.\u201d The gravity part seemed to shock him. \u201cHow did things stay on the ground?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEasy\u2026 there was no ground. We had floating islands that you could fly underneath and between. Everything that needed to be on the ground just was. We never worried about falling off an island because we could fly.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow did boundaries work? Like were there countries?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere were kingdoms and sectors that had rulers or tribes. Some places belonged to no one but the high king himself.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the high king?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDid no one tell him about the royalty? Danny wondered \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, there were kingdoms that had royalty that ruled over that land, for example, my friends Dora and Frostbite! Dora is the queen of the Old Lands but only the Old Lands like how Frostbite is the leader of the Far Frozen but only the Far Frozen. The high king is the ruler of the entire planet. He helps keep order between the different sectors. He also rules over the Old Lands and Far Frozen but not as intimately as Dora or Frostbite.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nNightwing seemed content to just sit back and listen to Danny explain where he came from. \u201cThat must be a lot of responsibility and work.\u201d He said under his breath but Danny of course heard it. \u201cOh it is, you won\u2019t believe the type of training I was put through to inherit the throne.\u201d The face Nightwing made at that information made Danny laugh and topple over mid-air as if he was rolling around on the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re the high king? You\u2019re like 13!\u201d Danny gasped in mock offense. \u201cI\u2019m more like 15 and I was the prince, not king. I can\u2019t exactly have a coronation if I\u2019m not there.\u201d Not that he wanted one. The whole being king thing wasn't something he wanted to do. \n\n\u00a0\n\nNightwing's face softened. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re here? Did you run away?\u201d Danny was more timid now he looked up from under his white fringe and said, \u201cIt\u2026 it wasn\u2019t safe\u2026 anymore. I had to get away but I didn\u2019t mean to come here. I was tired so I couldn\u2019t fly so I took the s-ship.\u201d He almost messed up and said speeder. Nightwing didn\u2019t need to lower his posture much to meet Danny at eye level. \u201cCan you tell me why it wasn\u2019t safe?\u201d And damn did Danny want to. It was easy to talk to Nightwing about this stuff and he just met him. He didn\u2019t prod like Batman about further information. He didn\u2019t try to change the subject when things got too sad like some of the others. Danny knew that they just wanted to keep him happy but he couldn\u2019t just keep this stuff to himself. But what did he tell the man? Oh yeah, I had to run away from a dangerous situation because I would have jumped into the grave instead of having only one foot in it. No that would reveal too much. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeople wanted to hurt me. I wasn\u2019t the most well-liked in some parts. It felt like there was no one to turn to\u2026\u201d He trailed off then he didn\u2019t know what else to say. \u201cWasn\u2019t there some adult you could have gone to?\u201d Danny almost scoffed at that. \u201cReasonable adult? Like who? The ones who thought it was a good idea to have a 14-year-old be king? I almost was crowned at 14 but was able to talk some sense into them.\u201d He knew he wasn\u2019t being fair to Clockwork or Pandora or any of the other ancients that helped him but really he didn\u2019t ask to be king. \u201cI haven\u2019t had the best experiences with adults so sorry for not exactly trusting them.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThere was silence between the two and it hung heavily. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWanna kidnap a gargoyle?\u201d Danny\u2019s head snapped up to Nightwing and let out a bark of surprised laughter. \u201cWhat?\u201d He said, still laughing. It was such an obvious change of subject but it worked with getting Danny out of his head. \u201cSome of them are hanging on by hope alone. It's unsafe. Who would notice if one goes missing? Maybe one of the smaller ones.\u201d Danny straightened out and landed on the edge of the building with Nightwing noticing once again how tall all these heroes are. \u201cSure, let's kidnap one.\u201d His stomach gave its own answer, \u201cBut first let\u2019s get that lunch you promised me.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nNightwing laughed and jumped off the building in response. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nDanny had fun with Nightwing. He took him to this fast food place that was superhero themed. No one even looked twice at them apparently Gotham citizens are immune to bullshit. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was taken back to the watchtower after lunch and Nightwing left soon after. This left Danny to entertain himself in the meantime. Staring up at his ceiling he got the idea to rearrange the stars there. Currently, they were just scattered about but he bet he could make them look like the constellation he memorized and loved so much. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe started to carefully peel off the stickers and lay them out on his desk when someone knocked on the door. Danny likes that, how good the heroes were with knocking and not walking in without permission. \u201cCome in!\u201d Danny yelled, not really caring who was on the other side. J\u2019onn walked in and asked what he was doing. \u201cI\u2019m trying to redo these to look like constellations from home.\u201d Danny learned that being in a new dimension came with an unfamiliar solar system. They didn\u2019t have the same constellations Danny thinks he\u2019s going to miss them. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWould you like some help?\u201d J\u2019onn walked closer to the point he was under some of the stars Danny still needed to take down. \u201cSure! Can you start taking down the stars?\u201d J\u2019onn nodded and floated up toward the ceiling. They worked in silence for a while until all of the stars were down. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really help me with the constellations because you don\u2019t know what they look like but you can hang around if you want.\u201d Danny kinda wants him to stick around. J\u2019onn was a peaceful person to be around and he wouldn\u2019t mind the company. J\u2019onn was an empath after all so maybe he knew what he wanted to ask when he stuck around. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was quiet again when Danny asked, \u201cHow was it\u2026 adjusting to earth?\u201d He wasn\u2019t looking at J\u2019onn when he asked. He was mapping out Orion's Belt when the Martian answered. \u201cHumans and Martians are very different. I had to learn what was and wasn\u2019t socially acceptable here on earth. I made mistakes but I also made great progress. This does not mean I wiped where I came from or my past culture from myself to seem more human. You do not need to stop being you in order to adjust. I would say you\u2019re doing great already.\u201d And wasn\u2019t that reassuring? Danny already had an advantage to being from earth but this world is so different from what he\u2019s used to.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s more like an alien than he was willing to admit for a while. He wasn\u2019t human and that was okay. He didn\u2019t need to be human and that was something he\u2019s been working on since he died. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDanny was about to respond when he heard something going on somewhere in the watchtower. It sounded like an argument which was weird because he heard Superman\u2019s voice. He didn\u2019t bother floating all the way to the floor when he went to investigate. J\u2019onn must have heard it too because he didn\u2019t question Danny, only followed right behind him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe argument got louder until Danny followed it to the meeting room. It was probably rude to eavesdrop like this and he had no business listening to an argument but he saw multiple heroes in here not just Superman and the person he was arguing with. Speaking of that person, he was a young man with black hair and blue eyes wearing a black shirt with Superman\u2019s S on it. Danny couldn\u2019t help but notice how much he looked like Superman. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMust be family drama Danny thought as he floated through the doorway. No one seemed to notice his arrival. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get to do this!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not listening to me!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re acting like-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare call me a child I swear to\u2026\u201d Danny didn\u2019t know what they were arguing about but the younger of the two kept cutting off Superman until he seemed to trail off when he caught Danny\u2019s eye. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d He asked. Danny just floated there awkwardly fidgeting with his hands. Wonder Woman stepped forward signaling for Danny to walk towards her. When she got close enough she put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cThis is Danny Phantom, he\u2019s been staying here for a while.\u201d Danny waved his hand and the guy kept on staring.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Superboy or Kon-El.\u201d He said bluntly, crossing his arms over his chest. If he was trying to intimidate Danny it wasn\u2019t working. Danny was hard to intimidate after all he\u2019s fought. \n\n\u00a0\n\nNo one talked for a few seconds so Danny decided to break the silence. \u201cAre you two brothers? I didn\u2019t know Supes had any siblings.\u201d With the deafening silence that followed his question, it was easy to tell he made a mistake somewhere. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOnce again it was Wonder Woman to the rescue, \u201cSuperboy is Superman\u2019s clone.\u201d She explained. Danny didn\u2019t really think this explained the tension in the room like she probably thought it did. \u201cOkay..? That\u2019s cool!\u201d He got a few odd looks at that and Superman seemed to come to his own conclusion. \u201cDo you know what a clone is?\u201d It was now Danny who had the weird look on his face. \u201cOf course I do. I have a clone of my own. Her name is Ellie, she\u2019s great, I love her.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd more silence. The silence was starting to get old. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou have a clone? And you just don\u2019t care?\u201d Asked Superboy in almost disbelief.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah? I mean we had a rocky beginning with her trying to kill me and all but we're cool now she\u2019s like my little sister.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nSuperboy turned back towards Superman with a wave of newfound anger. \u201cWhy the hell is a kid handling the fact that he has a clone better than you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying! I\u2019m sorry for how I acted when we first found you but I\u2019m trying now I just wish you could meet me halfway.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to do shit!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nOkay yeah, Danny definitely just walked into a shitstorm of family drama but he couldn\u2019t help but be confused. Superman seems so nice and chill with everything so far. It\u2019s hard to imagine him rejecting someone for being a clone. Danny also can\u2019t help but think back to when he learned the truth about Ellie. How scared she looked like he would toss her aside as Vlad did. He wouldn\u2019t dream of hurting her like that. To find out Superman, someone who submitted a form to become his guardian, did that to someone. Well, it definitely makes Danny want to burn the form. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid you reject him?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but ask in a small voice, all the attention in the room being directed at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid. You. Reject him?\u201d His voice was harder now and the heroes could faintly see his blue eyes returning to the green of his \u2018original\u2019 form. The temperature in the room was steadily dropping as Danny\u2019s anger rose. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDanny, kiddo, you don\u2019t understand fully.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI think I understand enough.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey stole my DNA and I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t handle it well at first but I\u2019m trying.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTrying doesn\u2019t fix any trauma Kon-El could have.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nSuperboy was stunned, to say the least. He hasn\u2019t had people other than his teammates and friends stand up for him like this. This random kid he\u2019s never met before who apparently also has a clone came out of nowhere. It felt\u2026 nice to be defended so quickly by a virtual stranger. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow did your clone come to be?\u201d Batman chimed in asking Danny. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDanny\u2019s attention was brought away from Superman as he thought about how he should answer. \u201cAn old enemy wanted me for himself or wanted me gone.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe temperature of the room declined. Did you do that?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nDanny shrugged half-heartedly. \u201cIt happens sometimes.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nBatman kept pushing on, \u201cWhen you demonstrated your powers there were some things you didn\u2019t show. Why?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nDanny was back on the floor now. He felt like a child being reprimanded. \u201cI forget about what I can do sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow can you forget about a power? About multiple powers?\u201d Batman was walking towards Danny and he took a small step back, not wanting to be crowded but unwilling to show how uncomfortable he truly was. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou try waking up on a different planet where nothing is the same and remember something that used to be a simple daily occurrence. This is like asking you how you forget about breathing. You just do it.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat powers did you forget to mention.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy am I being interrogated right now?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nFlash stepped forward, \u201cDon\u2019t mind spooky over there that\u2019s just how the detective is.\u201d He tried to laugh off the awkward tension in the air. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIf anything this just ruffled Danny\u2019s feathers. His eyebrows scrunched together and his posture became rigged. \u201cI don\u2019t want a detective right now\u2026 I want\u2026 time and\u2026 understanding.\u201d He turned to leave the room. He was done for today. He wanted to finish his constellations and sit on his bed looking at them with his lights off. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAs he made his way through the hallway he heard Superboy say, \u201cYou should leave him alone Batman. You heard him, he needs space.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nSilently thanking him in his head Danny continued to his room.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nDanny was laying on his bed the next morning, giving more thought to the whole of who should be his legal guardian. The choices seemed more simple now. Getting up he went over to where he kept the files and put them on his desk, spreading them out. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe separated them into two piles. A no and maybe pile. Taking the no pile he tossed them in the small trash can in the corner of his room. Picking up the maybe pile he went through all of them again. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe still had to narrow it down but it was really between three people. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt wasn't until almost lunchtime that he went to find Batman, the person in charge of all the guardian paperwork nonsense. He found the man in the screen room. It wasn't hard gaining his attention. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDanny stilled his nerves and with full confidence he said,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI made my decision.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nA few days later Danny was packing up his room. There wasn\u2019t much but it was enough to need a few boxes. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe folded all his clothes and took down all the stars. He carefully packed away all the gifts he was given to take to his new room in a new home. He was able to keep his bed sheets and blankets due to them also being gifted to him and him already knowing he was going to have the same type of bed in his new room. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe room looked exactly as it did when he first got there. It was kind of sad. He grew fond of this room and really started to think of it as his, not just a spare room. It was his but now it looked strange and boring. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHis door was open so when there was a knock on the door frame he knew who it was. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou ready to get out of here?\u201d He was asked. Danny smiled and nodded at his new guardian as he walked towards him. This was a new chapter in his life and he was going to have to adjust to it but he thinks he will be fine in the end. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWith one last look at a bare room and the last box in his hand, Danny hesitates but allows Dick to put his hand on his shoulder leading him away. \n\n\u00a0\n\nYeah, he thinks this will be fine. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
