Can you help us out with- oh\nwell, now i feel like a dumbass\n\nyou are a dumbass. you didn\u2019t check the lens cap?\n\n\nyou didn\u2019t notice it either!\n(thanks jirou you\u2019re the best i don\u2019t know what i\u2019d do without you.)\n\n\ndie, probably\n\nuncalled for\nbut also! not wrong\nanyways, we ready?\n\nyeah\ni\u2019ve got all my notes\n\n\naaaaaand\u2026. action!!\n\n---\nIt starts, as do many of the more interesting episodes of class 1-A\u2019s dorm life, with Kaminari getting an Idea. Now, the collateral damage of said ideas is ordinarily borne by Kirishima, Sero, and Mina, because they\u2019re Kaminari\u2019s best friends and generally willing at any time to throw themselves headfirst into any and all dangerous, harebrained shenanigans.\nThis time, however, is different.\nThis time, Kaminari walks up to Todoroki in the hallway after class and says, \u201cDude, I need your help.\u201d\nTodoroki checks over his shoulder, twice, to verify that Kaminari is indeed talking to him. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYesterday you asked Shinsou-kun if he was Aizawa-sensei\u2019s son,\u201d Kaminari says, as though that explains anything at all.\n\u201c...yes?\u201d\n\u201cMake a hero conspiracy YouTube channel with me.\u201d\nTodoroki blinks. Then he blinks again. When he opens his eyes, Kaminari is still standing there and his smile hasn\u2019t given an inch.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what.\u201d\nKaminari shrugs casually, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cYou just seem like you\u2019re into that kind of thing! And I think it\u2019d be fun! So what do ya say?\u201d\nTodoroki is silent for a long moment, until Kaminari starts to fidget slightly. Then he nods, once, and says, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d\nKaminari fist-pumps. \u201cHell yeah! You\u2019re not gonna regret this, dude. Come on, I need to tell you some ideas I\u2019ve got.\u201d\nTodoroki, still not entirely sure what\u2019s happening, follows.\n\u201cSo, I was thinking for our first episode we could do one of the top ten! That\u2019d net us more attention, and everybody already knows who they are anyways. Uh, probably not Endeavor. But like, Best Jeanist? He\u2019s pretty weird. I think maybe he\u2019s got a mustache, and that\u2019s why his turtleneck is pulled up all the way past his nose. Then when he\u2019s out of costume, people won\u2019t recognize him. I bet it\u2019s a bad mustache, too.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Todoroki says when Kaminari pauses for breath. \u201cWhat makes you sure he has a mouth at all?\u201d\nKaminari slowly turns to look at him, and whispers to himself, slightly awed, \u201cThis was the best idea ever.\u201d\n---\nThe borrowed camera switches on, focusing on two boys sitting on a couch. The one on the left is blonde-haired and practically bouncing with excitement, while the other has mismatched eyes, a stoic expression, and a jumble of papers on his lap.\n\nhey! hello! i\u2019m kaminari!\n\n\ni\u2019m todoroki\n\nand this is the first episode of hero theory!!!\nthe way it works is basically, my hella smart friend here will explain some wild theories about the pro heroes we all love and look up to\nand i\u2019ll react and like chime in and stuff!\n\nsuddenly it sounds like i\u2019m doing more work here\n\n\ntoo late! you already agreed to this\n\n\ni did and that was my mistake\nalright, so today we\u2019re talking-\n\n\ntheorizing!\nmakes us sound smarter\n\n\nTHEORIZING about the current number three hero, Best Jeanist, and what exactly is under his\u2026 neck. turtleneck.\n\n\njurtleneck\n\n\nno\n\n---\nThey post the first video the same day they film it, with minimal editing because neither of them really knows how to do that. Kaminari holds up a hand for a high five, which Todoroki returns with some hesitation and a few moments of confused squinting, and then they press the upload button together.\nThey don\u2019t really expect much.\nWhen he wakes up the next morning, Todoroki\u2019s email inbox is full of comments and subscription notifications. Not an overwhelming number, but far more than the amount he had expected (which was zero).\n---\nHero Theory Episode 1: What Does Best Jeanist Really Look Like?\n1,034 views\nComments \u2022 21\nMico Nico\nHoly shit these kids are hilarious\nSketching\nisn\u2019t that endeavor\u2019s son?? from the sports festival? i didn\u2019t know he could look excited\nTara Wonder\nOk but THEYRE NOT WRONG how do we KNOW he has a mouth\nAll Star\nmeh, production quality\u2019s crap but the idea\u2019s solid\nPaxxxton\nim lmao @ todoroki\u2019s face every time kaminari calls jeanist\u2019s hero costume \u2018the jostume\u2019\n---\nTodoroki is just finishing rereading the comments for the third time when Kaminari\u2019s practically breaking down his door, yelling in incoherent excitement. Todoroki lets him in before he can wake up Bakugou next door and cause an incident, and they go over the comments together, making note of the criticisms. They\u2019re both smiling, Kaminari huge and bright and Todoroki small and proud.\nTodoroki starts writing actual scripts, outlining the episode so he doesn\u2019t get distracted or lose his place. Kaminari visits Present Mic after class to ask for lessons in video editing. Jirou commandeers her camera back to film for them, and starts teaching them about lens options and audio settings.\nThe next day, Aizawa-sensei is collecting worksheets when he blinks down at the back of one, seemingly nonplussed, and says, \u201cTodoroki.\u201d\nTodoroki looks up.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this list on the back of your homework?\u201d\n\u201cBrainstorming,\u201d Todoroki says.\n\u201cFor what?\u201d\nTodoroki doesn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cAn extracurricular project.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of extracurricular project would produce the words \u2018Mount Lady is actually giant and her quirk is shrinking down to normal size?\u2019\u201d Aizawa-sensei asks, his voice totally flat.\n\u201cOh, dude, that\u2019s a great one!\u201d Kaminari exclaims, drawing the attention of the classroom. \u201cWe should do that next. Hang on, what else is on there?\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s how the rest of Class 1-A finds out about the project.\n---\n\nso, if she\u2019s actually huge\nwould she get big again if she had quirk restraints on then? or her quirk was cancelled somehow?\n\n\nthat would depend on whether her quirk is active when she\u2019s small\nlike, is she constantly using it to stay that size or does she just use it once to shrink\n\n\noh probably the second one! right? cause otherwise how would she sleep?\n\n\nin a\u2026 really big house? \n\n\u2026\n\nwait, don-\n\n\nHEY AIZAWA-SENSEI!! CAN YOU HELP US TEST A THEORY?\n\n\nwe\u2019re going to die\n\n---\norigamidragons posted\nokay so hero theory is a great show just in general but my favorite part of it is the confirmation that todoroki shouto is not in fact that stoic badass we all thought he was after the sports festival and is instead a gIGANTIC NERD\n108 notes #hero theory #person: todoroki shouto\n---\nOne by one, a few of their other classmates get roped into the production. Other then Jirou, who\u2019s settled into her role as their camerawoman, there\u2019s also Midoriya, whose encyclopedic knowledge of heroes and quirks makes him a common guest expert; Yaoyorozu and Iida, who are always willing to help with research; and Hagakure, who\u2019s happy to be equipped with a Go-Pro and set to work trying to get evidence for various theories.\nMost of the rest of class 1-A makes at least an appearance or two, be it by crossing through the background to get leftovers from the fridge and scowling at the camera (Bakugou) or belly-flopping onto the couch between the two hosts to insert their own opinion (Mina, frequently).\nAnd slowly, steadily, their subscriber count begins to grow. As word gets around about the series and it increases in quality and popularity, they start getting more views, more likes, more comments. Some of them are trolls or spam, but the vast majority are genuine praise.\nTodoroki\u2019s not exactly sure just how it happens, but before long he\u2019s the writer and co-host for one of the fastest-growing new shows on YouTube. He\u2019s also suddenly friends with Kaminari, and he\u2019s not quite sure how that happened, either.\nBut he\u2019s definitely not complaining.\n---\nHero Theory Episode 9: What Species is UA\u2019s Principal Nedzu?\n41,567 views\nComments \u2022 291\nPterror\nokay but did you see that wink at the go pro at 5:66? nedzu definitely knew they were filming him im Afraid\nTake On Me\nI love how they say Midoriya\u2019s a guest star but really Todoroki just drags him over to the couch, gives him a topic and just lets him run.\nFree Bird\nI think he\u2019s a rat? A really big rat? I don\u2019t know what kaminari\u2019s on but that is DEFINITELY not a bear\nYuki Nora\nfdgsjgdhdj koda\u2019s face when they ask if his quirk works on nedzu WHAT DOES HE KNOW\n---\nThe show makes Endeavor furious, which of course is only another reason to not just continue it but continue to improve it. He calls Todoroki one day to rant about how the \u2018ridiculous\u2019 videos are damaging his reputation and preventing people from taking him seriously.\nTodoroki plays the entire four-minute message on speakerphone, stone-faced, in the credits to episode fourteen as Kaminari absolutely loses it laughing next to him.\n---\neverywhereilook reblogged from kingofthegarbagehill\nGif: Todoroki explaining a theory very seriously to the camera while Kaminari reacts with exaggerated expressions of shock next to him.\nGif: Sero, not noticing the camera, walks directly into the shot and starts searching for the TV remote under the couch cushion that Todoroki is sitting on.\nGif: Kaminari acting out a theoretical fight scene, complete with sound affects and a lightsaber substituting for a sword.\nGif: Selfie-cam style footage with Todoroki staring flatly into the camera in the foreground. In the background, Kaminari can be seen trying to get an explanation from Aizawa as to why his hair floats.\nGif: Midoriya, sitting between Todoroki and Kaminari on the couch, sketches out a diagram in a notebook while muttering to himself, then holds it up to the camera.\nGif: Kaminari and Todoroki sitting on the couch, ready to film. A hand appears in the shot from behind the camera, someone counting down on their fingers: three, two, one.\n451 notes #hero theory #gifset #gif warning #class 1-a content\n---\n\nhey guys! i\u2019m kaminari\n\n\nand i\u2019m todoroki\n\n\nand this is episode fifteen of hero theory! \n\ntoday we\u2019re going to be theorizing about the ghost hero, ectoplasm.\nfor some background, ectoplasm\u2019s hero costume consists of a long sleeveless trenchcoat-slash-cloak, and he does all his fighting exclusively with his legs\nthis has led some people-\n\npretty sure it\u2019s just us, dude\n\n\n-to wonder if he has arms at all\n\n\nwe couldn\u2019t find any pictures or anything confirming either way, so we decided we\u2019d try and find out ourselves!\nwish us luck!\n\n\ni want it on record that I think this is a terrible idea \n\nThe screen switches to a shaky, hand-held found-footage camera feed. Ectoplasm is visible in center of the shot, clearly unaware of the students\u2019 presence. The camera pans slightly to one side to show Todoroki, who activates his quirk to create a snowball in his right hand.\n\u201cReady?\u201d Kaminari whispers from behind the camera. Todoroki nods once, expression tight. Kaminari yells, \u201cTHINK FAST!\u201d as Todoroki throws the snowball, aiming directly at Ectoplasm\u2019s head.\nEctoplasm\u2019s head jerks up at the shout and he launches himself into a leap, spinning around in midair and smashing the snowball to power with one peg leg. Kaminari makes a strangled sound as the teacher, clearly annoyed and lightly dusted with snow, glares directly at the camera. He grabs Todoroki\u2019s arm and starts backing down the hallway.\n\u201cAbort mission, abort mission, run run run run-\u201c\nThe footage ends there, switching back to the familiar sight of the two boys on the couch, obviously filmed on a later date than the first segment.\n\ni told you it wouldn\u2019t work\n\n\nit was worth a try!!\n\n\nwas it worth the week of lunch detention?\n\n\nabsolutely, dude. \n\n---\nAmilie Red @houseofarms\nthe real reason todoroki and kaminari from hero theory r so good at their job: their homeroom teacher is a certified cryptid\nShalyssa @itsyagirllyssa\nyaoyorozu appearing in the latest episode of hero theory solely to roast uwabami for being anti-feminist cleared my skin, watered my crops,\nFive Plastic Dinosaurs @katitulips\ni relate to todoroki shouto bc i too am an antisocial mess constantly being dragged into dumb shit by an extroverted friend\n---\nThe idea for episode twenty comes, of all places, from Midoriya. He catches Todoroki\u2019s attention one day during lunch, and says, \u201cHave you ever thought about researching any older heroes for your show? Like from the Silver Age?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Todoroki admits. His knowledge of heroes is extensive, but it\u2019s limited to those that are currently active or very recently retired. Endeavor never saw any use in teaching him about dead or long-retired heroes who would never pose a threat to him, which means he barely knows anything about any heroes from before the time of All Might beyond what\u2019s taught in history class. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea, though. Do you have one in mind?\u201d\nAnd Midoriya says, without a moment of hesitation, \u201cNana Shimura.\u201d\nIt\u2019s harder to research than the other episodes, even with Midoriya\u2019s pre-existing knowledge to draw from. Nana Shimura is from before heroes were widely monitored and registered, so most information about her is vague, but Todoroki recruits Yaoyorozu to help him and Midoriya search, and little by little they build a story.\nIt\u2019s quite a story.\n---\n\nhey hey guys! as you all know, i\u2019m kaminari\n\n\nand i\u2019m todoroki\n\nand this is episode 20- holy shit- of hero theory!!\nwe\u2019ve got a surprise for you guys today! a deep dive into the age of heroes past!\ntodoroki, you wanna explain?\nright. today we\u2019re talking about a lesser-known heroine from the silver age\nit\u2019s important to learn not just about the heroes who are active today, but also those that came before\nso today we\u2019re telling you the story of a woman named nana shimura, hero name adamant\n\nhell yeah!! and let me tell you guys, this lady was a certified, grade a badass\nshe could beat me up and i wouldn\u2019t even be mad\n\n\nlots of people could beat you up, though\ndidn\u2019t ojiro kick your ass in training this morning?\n\n\ndon\u2019t expose me like this, dude\n\n\nit\u2019s what i\u2019m here for\n\n\nyeah i know\nANYWAYS!!

After a long beat of silence, Todoroki, very slowly and uncertainly, hugs him back.\nHe might not be able to understand just what he\u2019s being thanked for, but he can tell it\u2019s something important.\nIf All Might\u2019s rake-thin shoulders are shuddering, Todoroki doesn\u2019t mention it.\n---\n\nso normally, we\u2019re always talking about heroes on this show, right?\n\n\nyes, it is called \u2018hero theory,\u2019 kaminari\n\nright! so today, we\u2019re taking a break from all that!\ninstead, we\u2019re going to be theorizing on the other side of the law! the villains!\ntake it away, todoroki\n\nso stain was wrong and people who idolize him are terrible\nhere\u2019s why\n\n\nheck yeah, man, spill that tea\n\n\ni have no idea what that means\n\n---\nJosephine Johnson @jojojojo\nmy aesthetic is todoroki shouto completely dismantling stain\u2019s fucked-up ideology while kaminari cheers him on\nHitsumi Tatsuya @burnboiburn\nMusutafu Tonight Whomst?

He has to spend a while thinking about it, making sure it\u2019s what he wants to do. Talks to Midoriya, and All Might, and Fuyumi and Natsuo.\nThen he tells Kaminari he wants to do an episode on Endeavor. And through halting words, he tells him why.\n---\nHero Theory Episode 23: The Truth About Endeavor?\n432,765 views\nComments \u2022 3,283\nRazzmatazz\nholy fuck\nMira Ramone\nis this for real? if this is a publicity thing, it\u2019s really tasteless.\nZevvon\nThe part at 10:51 where Kaminari puts his hand on Todoroki\u2019s shoulder? My HEART\nTerabyte Tim\ntodoroki sounds so\u2026 off. i want to give him a hug???\nReimi \nDID KAMINARI REALLY CALL THE NUMBER ONE HERO A BURNED CHICKEN NUGGET WE STAN ONE ICON\n---\nFrom behind the camera, Jirou counts them down with hand signals: three, two, one, go. As soon as she hits the last, Kaminari breaks out into a beaming grin. \u201cHey guys! So, Hero Theory is going to be a little different today. There was a lot of demand on it for Twitter, especially after the last episode, so we\u2019re doing a Q&amp;A thing to celebrate hitting a hundred thousand subscribers!\u201d\nTodoroki nods. He looks a little more downcast and anxious than he usually does, not quite making eye contact with the camera.\n\u201cIf you have a question, remember to submit it on Twitter under the hashtag #HTQA! Asshole questions will be smited with the fury of a thousand suns and one point three million volts!\u201d\n\u201cSmote.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cPast tense of smite is smote,\u201d Todoroki clarifies.\n\u201cOkay, then asshole questions will be smote. Let\u2019s get this started!\u201d Kaminari pulls out his phone and starts scrolling through the tag. \u201cFirst question! One I\u2019ve been asking for ages. Todoroki. Dude. Why don\u2019t you have a Twitter yet?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need one,\u201d Todoroki says, like it\u2019s obvious.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying,\u201d Kaminari confides in an aside to the camera. \u201cDude\u2019s intent on being a social media ghost. Second question: \u2018are you two dating?\u2019 Tragically, no. He\u2019s hot, and I know, anybody would be lucky to have me, but Todoroki\u2019s already got a cru-\u201d\nThe last word is abruptly cut off into a stifled yell when he takes a couch pillow hard to the face. Todoroki, holding the pillow over Kaminari\u2019s mouth with one hand, steals his phone with the other and scrolls through the next few questions while ignoring his co-host\u2019s muffled complaints.\n\u201c\u2018Will you ever do theories on your classmates?\u2019\u201d he reads. \u201cMaybe, but probably not. We already know them very well, and the hero license exam revealed that we place ourselves at a disadvantage if we release too much information about ourselves.\u201d He scrolls down to the next question, and reads it\u00a0silently with raised eyebrows before staring flatly into the camera. \"Keep your questions appropriate.\"\nKaminari finally succeeds in shoving free of the pillow a few questions later, and seizes his phone back, settling into his seat again. \u201c\u2018Where did the idea for the Adamant episode come from?\u2019 I actually don\u2019t know. Todoroki?\u201d\n\u201cThat one was Midoriya\u2019s idea. Apparently he was a big fan of hers and wanted her to get more recognition.\u201d\n\u201cNice. \u2018Who\u2019s your cameraman?\u2019 Camerawoman, actually. Say hi, Jirou!\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Jirou says, sounding bemused. A hand wearing chipped black nail polish appears in the shot, flashing a peace sign at the audience. Todoroki gives her a thumbs up.\n\u201c\u2018Question for both of you,\u2019\u201d Kaminari continues. \u201c\u2018which episode was your favorite?\u2019 Oh, uh, I was really proud of the Thirteen episode. We had a whole ton of nonbinary folks commenting to tell us they were happy with the way we handled all the theorizing about their gender! That was great!\u201d\n\u201cThe Adamant episode was mine,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cIt was harder to research, but it felt good to see a less glorified hero get the recognition she deserved.\u201d He pauses, then adds, \u201cPersonally, though, I got the most satisfaction out of the Endeavor episode.\u201d\nKaminari grins at that, before moving on to the next question. \u201c\u2018Why don\u2019t you guys have a Discord server?\u2019 We should absolutely have a Discord server. That\u2019s such a good idea. I\u2019m making one as soon as we\u2019re done with this.\u201d\n\u201cNext question! This one\u2019s for Todoroki too. Let me know if you\u2019re not comfortable answering this, dude. \u2018Why\u2019d you decide to make the Endeavor episode?\u2019\u201d\nTodoroki is quiet for a long moment before he answers, measuring his words. \u201cBecause\u2026 it\u2019s important that people understand what sort of person he is. Even if he\u2019s trying to be better now, and do better.\u201d He shrugs a little. \u201cAfter the Adamant episode proved that our show could actually have an impact, it just felt right.\u201d\n\u201cGood answer, dude,\u201d Kaminari says. \u201c\u2018How did you get the idea to start this show?\u2019 This one I can answer. Okay, so one of our classmates, Shinsou, you guys know him, he showed up in one of our episodes when we were talking about, uh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNegative quirk stigma,\u201d Todoroki says.\n\u201cRight, that. So he\u2019s got kind of crazy hair and looks tired all the time, and Aizawa-sensei has crazy hair and looks tired all the time, so on the first day after Shinsou joined our class-\u201c\n\u201cIs this necessary?\u201d\n\u201cYep!\u201d Kaminari answers, sounding absolutely delighted. \u201cOn the first day after Shinsou joined our class, Todoroki walked up to him and asked him, to his face, if he was secretly Aizawa-sensei\u2019s secret love child.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that unreasonable,\u201d Todoroki mutters, looking away from the camera. \u201cAizawa-sensei was privately training him to get him into the hero course, and gave him a version of his capture weapon too.\u201d\n\u201cSo I saw this go down, and my immediate thought was, of course, dude, that guy would be a perfect co-host for a show about hero conspiracy theories.\u201d Kaminari grinned widely, and hooked an arm around Todoroki\u2019s shoulders, pulling him into a one-armed hug. \u201cAnd look, I was right!\u201d\n---\n\u201cAre you okay, man?\u201d Kaminari asks, after they finish filming. He sounds uncharacteristically cautious when he says it.\nTodoroki has to think about it for a moment. He nods. \u201cYeah, I think I am.\u201d\nWhen Kaminari holds his hand up for a high five this time, Todoroki doesn\u2019t hesitate.\n\nhey hey everybody! kaminari here!\n\n\nand i\u2019m todoroki\n\n\nand this is episode 25 of hero theory! lucky number 25!\n\n\nthat\u2019s not a thing\n\n\nsure it is\n\n\n25\u2019s not lucky\n\n\nhow do you KNOW, though\n\n\nit\u2019s just not? Numbers aren\u2019t just lucky cause you say they are\n anyways-\n\n\nare you an expert in which numbers are lucky and which ones arent\n\n\nANYWAYS\n today we\u2019re talking about the famous vigilante popstar, pop step\n\n\nyou mean pop\u2606step!!\n\n\nhow did you pronounce that out loud\n\n---\nCap Addy @bowieb1\ni hope todoroki shouto knows i would die for him. i mean, he could kill me with one hand, but still. i would Die for him.\nKaminari Denki @chargebolt\n@bowieb1 i read this to him and he said \u201cplease don\u2019t\u201d with a completely straight face dude is unreal\nHitsumi Tatsuya @burnboiburn\nhero theory is like half conspiracy theories, half insane sitcom with a cast of 20 and im so here for it\n\u00a0---\nThe suggestion sheet is- well, really it\u2019s Todoroki\u2019s idea, but Mina\u2019s fault. Once the show explodes in popularity, she and Sero develop a habit of ambushing Todoroki to suggest ideas. After the third time Todoroki very nearly sets them on fire, he gives up and yanks a piece of tape from Sero\u2019s elbow to stick a sheet of notebook paper to their classroom wall.\nFor a time, the suggestion sheet serves as an anonymous idea dump for anybody in Class 1-A. Sooner or later, however, knowledge of it spreads to the rest of UA\u2019s student body.\n'Why Class 1-B is definitively better than the 1-A idiots' has shown up more than once, so Monoma, at least, definitely knows about it.\nMost of the ideas on the sheet are usually nonsense even by the show\u2019s spectacularly low standards, but Todoroki makes a point of checking the sheet every day after class regardless. Sometimes they have potential.\nWhen he checks the list on Thursday, this is what it says:\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Todoroki says.\n\u00a0---\nHero Theory Episode 26: Why Is UA\u2019s Class 1B Better Than Class 1A?\n201,294 views\nComments \u2022 1,032\nLemonlion\ndid i\ndid i seriously just get rickrolled in the year of our lord 2197\nFacepalm\nit really does loop for the whole twenty-six minutes if you were wondering\n\u30b8\u30e8\u30ea\u30f3\nI\u2019m not sure if I want to high five Kaminari or punch him in the face\n\u00a0---\n\u201cWe need to get Bakugou on the show more, man,\u201d Kaminari declares with no prelude, kicking Todoroki\u2019s door down and tossing himself onto his bed. Todoroki, who is not entirely sure when he got used to this, has already relocated to the end of the bed to avoid impact.\n\u201cWhy,\u201d Todoroki says flatly after a moment. \u201cAll he does is yell. And try to blow up the camera. And us.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a crowd-pleaser! The people love him!\u201d Kaminari protests.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Todoroki repeats, lost.\n\u201cHell if I know,\u201d Kaminari says with a shrug. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter, dude! Giving the people what they want is an important part of showbiz! Even when what they want is a walking landmine throwing a perpetual tantrum!\u201d\n\u00a0---\n\nhey hey awesome people! i\u2019m kaminari\n\n\nand I\u2019m todoroki\n\n\nand this is episode 28 of hero theory\n but before we get started, i just gotta say\n midoriya. bro.

By the time Kaminari wakes up and learns about it, it\u2019s already been taken down twice, re-uploaded by various accounts four times, and racked up hundreds of thousands of views.\nHis immediate impulse, of course, is to drag Todoroki out of bed and set up a camera to film a response.\n\u00a0---\n\ni\u2019m kaminari!!\n\n\nand i\u2019m todoroki\n are you going to tell me what this is about now?\n\n\nyep!\n you might have noticed that this isn\u2019t part of our standard upload schedule!\n And that\u2019s because we\u2019re trying something different this time!\n This\u2019ll be a reaction video\n somebody uploaded a response video to our last episode and it\u2019s absolutely blown up online\n it\u2019s been taken down like three times for some reason but just keeps getting reuploaded!\n so neither of us have seen this yet!\n\n\n...this is what you woke me up at seven am on a saturday for?\n\n\nahaha... ha\u2026 yeah\u2026\n ANYWAYS let\u2019s start the video now!\n\n\u00a0---\n\nThe video is grainy, obviously filmed someplace with bad lighting on a shaky, handheld phone camera. The phone is held vertically, so the view is narrow. Nonetheless, the trademark scars and staples of the villain Dabi were clearly visible. The start of the video had caught Dabi mid-rant, and cackling, wheezing laughter was audible in the background.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill that brat,\u201d Dabi seethed. \u201cI swear I am.\u201d\n\n\nA girl\u2019s voice cooed from behind the phone. \u201cAwwww, Touya-chan, don\u2019t be like that!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am going to set you on fire,\u201d Dabi ground out, jabbing a finger at the phone. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to set him on fire. And then you,\u201d he snapped at someone offscreen, \u201cif you don\u2019t stop FUCKING LAUGHING!\u201d\n\n\nThe laughter did not stop. Blue sparks were falling from Dabi\u2019s fingertips and he looked about two seconds from a conniption.\n\n\n\u201cNaaaaah,\u201d the girl said. \u201cYou won\u2019t. You looove us.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t test me,\u201d Dabi snarled. \u201cFuckin\u2019 Shouto\u2026 When I finally off the old man, he\u2019s not allowed to bitch about it. It\u2019s his fault I have to deal with all of THIS now. Fuck this. Fuck everything. I need to go burn something.\u201d\n\n\nHe stormed out of frame, and a few seconds later a door could be heard slamming. There was a pause, then a rustling sound, and the video flipped around to show Himiko Toga\u2019s sickly golden eyes, flushed cheeks, and wide, mischievous smile.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Denki-kun, Shouto-kun!\u201d she said with a wink. \u201cFor the record, I don\u2019t think Best Jeanist has a mouth either.\u201d She brandished a knife in front of the camera. \u201cBut I hope I can find out someday!\u201d\n\n\nShe blew a kiss to the camera, and then the footage ended.\n\n\u00a0---\n\n...\n\n\n...uh. huh. that was...\n you okay there, dude?\n Todoroki?\n oh shiiiit jirou get the fire extinguisher-\n\n\u00a0---\n\u201cHey, Todoroki?\u201d Kaminari tries, rapping his fist against the door. The wood feels cold beneath his knuckles, which is a good sign, because it means that Todoroki probably hasn\u2019t set anything else on fire. \u201cYou in there?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWe, uh, put the fire out. In case you were wondering. The couch is a little charred, but it\u2019s still not as bad as the time Bakugou and Kirishima tried to have a horror movie marathon.\u201d\nHe\u2019s rewarded by a soft huff of bemused laughter from the door, and surreptitiously fist-pumps in triumph before sobering again. \u201cDude\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. This is my fault, I know you didn\u2019t want to do the episode, and now it\u2019s stirred up all this shit.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Todoroki starts, then stops, then starts again, \u201cI\u2019m- not angry. Really. I just\u2026 need to call my sister before she sees that on her own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right, shit, yeah. You should do that. I just needed to ask, are you cool with me uploading the reaction video? I won\u2019t if you don\u2019t want me to.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long pause.\n\u201cNo, upload it.\u201d There\u2019s a hint of a smirk in his voice when Todoroki adds, \u201cThe comments will be amazing.\u201d\n\u201cDude, you are so right.\u201d\nHe\u2019s right. The comments are amazing.\n\u00a0---\nThe Prez @PresidentKamina\nso uh we gonna talk about how hero theory just Did That\nKuroyuki no Ryu @KYnR\nEventually I feel like the school\u2019s gonna stop paying for new couches for 1-a\u2019s dorm, isn\u2019t this like the second one in two weeks?\nLoulou\u2764\ufe0f @pickmeup\n@KYnR for a school that can afford as many giant killer robots as ua can id like to think they can spring for replacement couches\nMeme-chan @himecut\nwish I could deal with all unpleasant emotional reveals by setting the nearest thing on fire\n\u304a\u306b\u3067\u308a\u3042 @onydalia\ni know we\u2019re all flailing right now but can we consider hero theory being right about one absurd thing means that aLL THEIR OTHER RIDICULOUS THEORIES MAY ALSO BE TRUE\nSar\u00a0C\u00a0@sacchari\nthe fact that dabi is confirmed to be touya combined with that older episode about endeavor paints... a really unsettling picture\nJHR @number47\n@sacchari oh fuck oh fuck you\u2019re right I didn\u2019t even think of that\n\u00a0---\n\nhey hey everybody! kaminari here\n\n\nand i\u2019m todoroki\n\n\nback from our unexpected two week hiatus!\n sorry about that, guys. we had a few unpleasant revelations i think everybody in japan knows about by now\n\n\ntouya, if you\u2019re watching this, call mom, you asshole\n\n\n(wheeze)\n oh my god\n hahahahahaha\n and (wheeze) and then we had to face the worst villain yet-\n\n\nwhat do you m-\n\n\nmidterms\n\n\noh right\n\n\nbut we\u2019re back in STYLE now\n take it away, todoroki!\n\n\nright, so today we\u2019re talking about the hero team known as the wild wild pussycats\n most people know they suffered a major fall in the rankings lately, but not why they did\n and it\u2019s actually pretty important\n\n\u00a0---\nHero Theory Episode 30: What Happened to the Wild Wild Pussycats?\n341,382 views\nComments \u2022 1,480\nCW\nalright, time to start a gofundme to mail ragdoll the biggest goddamn box of chocolates i can find, who\u2019s with me\n\u3069\u305e\u3088\u308d\u3057\u304f\nMidoriya was a really good guest in this episode!

It starts as just a place to chat about the latest episodes of hero theory and ask the creators questions, but it doesn\u2019t take long for it to go completely off the rails in the best way. The entirety of Class 1-A joins it, as do (to everyone\u2019s surprise) a few pro heroes, followed swiftly by a veritable flood of civilians. Todoroki and Kaminari are admins, while Jirou, Midoriya, Kirishima and Yaoyorozu get made moderators.\nTodoroki mostly lurks on invisible mode, and inserts his opinion into conversations whenever it\u2019s least expected, while Kaminari enthusiastically and constantly hypes up whatever the next episode will be, runs polls, and is generally a ray of hyperactive sunshine.\nThe suggestion sheet stays up on the classroom wall, of course, but now they have a constant stream of video ideas from the public as well. Most of the ideas are a bit too crazy even for them, Todoroki starts keeping a list on his phone of the good ones.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Kaminari says one day, while hanging upside down off of his bed, squinting at the results of the latest community poll on his phone. \u201cPeople really want more villain episodes.\u201d\n\u201cMm?\u201d Todoroki asks, glancing up from his English homework.\n\u201cYeah! Like, yesterday I asked the server what their favorite episodes were, and the Adamant and Endeavor episodes were right up there at the top, but like the next two after that were the ones we did on Stain and Dabi.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Dabi episode was popular because he\u2019s a villain,\u201d Todoroki said. \u201cThat was because it actually turned out to be true.\u201d\n\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d\n\u00a0---\nPETITION: ADD NANA SHIMURA TO THE NATIONAL HEROISM MEMORIAL\n500,000/500,000 signatures received\n\u00a0---\nThe petition is posted anonymously online.

Yaoyorozu holds out an arm to generate a constant supply of tissues for Midoriya, who\u2019s a weeping mess.\n\u00a0---\n\none of our most popular episodes ever was our feature on adamant, aka nana shimura\n\n\nand hey shout out to everybody who signed the petition!
